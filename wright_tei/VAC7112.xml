&#xD;
scene before her by repeating the one word&#xD;
--Iboo-ful ! boo-ful !"&#xD;
It was beautiful. Like all spotless, pure&#xD;
and heaven-sent things, it was beautiful. So&#xD;
long as it remained uncontaminated by the&#xD;
touch of man, it lay in its unldefiled glory like&#xD;
the down from an angel's wing. And now&#xD;
that the moon was rising in cold and myste-&#xD;
rious beauty, casting her steel-blue rays on&#xD;
the blanched objects at her feet, the freezing&#xD;
night air seemed to shut out sounds as though&#xD;
they were too worldly to intrude on this&#xD;
ghostly scene, over which the orb of night&#xD;
presided with queenly grace. lBut this was&#xD;
after dusk, when the darkness had sent good&#xD;
working-men home (all except John), and&#xD;
bad working men and bad idling le out u; and&#xD;
had bid the weary seamstress rise and seek&#xD;
relief from the fatigue of sitting, by encoun-&#xD;
tering the fatigue of walking ; when the&#xD;
reputable shops had closed and the disrel)uta-&#xD;
ble ones had opened ; and when, spite of the&#xD;
efforts of restless spirits to turn day into&#xD;
night, and quiet into tumult, the general feel-&#xD;
ing was one of rest.&#xD;
During the day it was different. Then all&#xD;
had been noise and hubbub and clamor.&#xD;
The snow had fidlen on the paveeiint and in&#xD;
the street as well as on the house and tree-&#xD;
tops. But, alas ! on the pavement and in&#xD;
the street it had been crushed and crouched&#xD;
and blackened, till it no more resembled its&#xD;
sister-covering on the house and tree-tops&#xD;
than the noisy, bustling day resembled the&#xD;
calm and peace ol night. Tme hurrying foot-&#xD;
steps of hundreds of men and scores of wo-&#xD;
men had trampled it down until the once spot-&#xD;
less snow, as if ashamed of its degradation,&#xD;
now ran in liquid blackness to the gutters be-&#xD;
yond. Men, slipping and sliding over the un-&#xD;
certain surface had " cursed the snow " and it-&#xD;
tered oaths at it as if it had been a living and&#xD;
sentient thing ; and women, contemplating the&#xD;
bedraggled fate of sometime spotless petti-&#xD;
coats, had stamped their feet with vexation,&#xD;
&#xD;
IT was late one night in January (more&#xD;
years ago than I think it necessary to men-&#xD;
tion), and the snow had been falling heavily&#xD;
all day. The beautiful white flakes had set-&#xD;
tied down like an ermine robe on the ho'ise-&#xD;
tops opposite, and hung, making a spotless&#xD;
fringe of rich, colorless chenille, on the bare,&#xD;
gaunt limbs of the trees in the park. Our&#xD;
ash barrel (which had not been removed from&#xD;
before our door for some days on account of&#xD;
an unpleasant difficulty between the street-&#xD;
surveyors and the street-conveyors), was&#xD;
frosted all over with this white coating, and&#xD;
looked precisely as if it contained a huge&#xD;
wedding-cake covered inches deep with lus-&#xD;
cious sugary  icing." Our little darling girl,&#xD;
Baby Lollipops, who was four years old and&#xD;
had never seen the snow, or if she had did&#xD;
not remember it, called out to me in a clear,&#xD;
sharp, high little voice, musical as the clang-&#xD;
or of a silvery bell, " Oh, Mamma, look !&#xD;
somebody's dawn and emptied de flour barrel&#xD;
all over de celler-door !"  And when I&#xD;
took the little sprite up, and, lifting her high&#xD;
in my arms, showed her through the window-&#xD;
panes that numberless " flour-barrels " had&#xD;
cast their contents over the grocery-man's&#xD;
wheel-barrow, and the barber's pole, and the&#xD;
stationary news-boy's awning-covered tent,&#xD;
and the lamp-post on the corner, and the&#xD;
stone carriage-step before the Highuns' door,&#xD;
and had even left a thin ridge on the old-&#xD;
fashioned "scraper " before our own, she&#xD;
clapped her chubby hands together and&#xD;
laughed with glee and kicked vigorously,&#xD;
thereby endangering her personal safety as&#xD;
she sat perched on my shoulder, holding on&#xD;
to my front .hair for security-and all the&#xD;
while she passed baby comment on th  novel&#xD;

and tutted and pished with true feminine as- f&#xD;
perity. The declining sun, had sent his e&#xD;
adieux to earth in the shape of two cutting  f&#xD;
winds which met and mingled, and called i&#xD;
themselves a Nor' Easter; and Nor' Easter&#xD;
laughed at the people as they muffled them-s&#xD;
selves closer in their outer wrappings, all in- I&#xD;
effectual to stave off the cutting, insidious&#xD;
breath of the winter's night; and then, sud-&#xD;
denly Nor' said to Easter " Halloa ! what's&#xD;
this black water trying to escape us and run l&#xD;
away down into the city sewers ? Let's freeze r&#xD;
it!" And so the poor snow of the pavement&#xD;
and the street was caught in the act of try-I&#xD;
ing to escape, and frozen into a thin, filmy&#xD;
substance, all cracking into flaws and fuller&#xD;
of dirt than before ; while the spotless snow&#xD;
of the house  and tree-tops looked down&#xD;
wonderingly at her fallen sister, with some&#xD;
pity for her in her heart it is true, but still&#xD;
turning up her nose at her vigorously, for&#xD;
society's sake.&#xD;
It was past eight o'clock, and John had&#xD;
not come home. The chops were done brown&#xD;
and even scorched, and the biscuit-crusts&#xD;
hard as a board, from staying too long in the&#xD;
oven. The butter, which had been frozen&#xD;
stiff by the cold weather was now running in&#xD;
oily streams over the hearth-stone where I&#xD;
had placed it to soften. Again and again I&#xD;
went to the window, and shading my eyes&#xD;
with my hands peered out intently into the&#xD;
darkness of the night. I was not exactly&#xD;
worried.  Oh, no!  It was an express under-&#xD;
standing between me and my husband that I&#xD;
was not to worry about him if lie happened&#xD;
to stay out late. The chances of his being&#xD;
run over by a street-car and killed, and the&#xD;
chances of his being detained an hour or two&#xD;
longer at his work were about in the propor-&#xD;
tion of one to a hundred. Therefore, I must&#xD;
never worry, And I did not.  Oh dear no!&#xD;
Only I wished he would come, that's all!&#xD;
I had just seated myself at the table des-&#xD;
pairingly, having resolved, after many doubts&#xD;
as to the propriety of such a course, to take&#xD;
my supper without him, when suddenly I&#xD;
heard the sharp click of a night-key in the&#xD;
front door, immediately followed by the dear,&#xD;
springy, elastic step I knew so well.&#xD;
"Well, darling, did you think I was never&#xD;
coming? '" said John in his cheery tone, hang-&#xD;
ing his cap and overcoat on a peg near the&#xD;
door. "Whew!" he continued without wait-&#xD;
ing for a reply, "whew! isn't it cold?  Give&#xD;
me my supper, pet, I am as hungry as a&#xD;
hound."&#xD;
"Baby's been abed these two hours.&#xD;
What kept you so late, John?" I asked, bend-&#xD;
ing down to take the butter-plate with my&#xD;
right hand, and shielding my face from the fire&#xD;
with my left.&#xD;
" Tell you in a minute. Why don't you&#xD;
give me a kiss ?" I raised my lips to his, and&#xD;
he caught my chin with his right hand and&#xD;
placed his left fore-finger in close proximity&#xD;
to my nose. " Now, Nell," he said reproach-&#xD;
&#xD;
ully, "you've been crying ! I see it. Your&#xD;
yes are as red as "-and finding himself at&#xD;
adult for a simile, he could only say-" possi-&#xD;
ble. They are. You've been worrying about&#xD;
me when you should not. You know you&#xD;
shouldn't tease yourself in this way. My&#xD;
poor little wife worrying herself to death&#xD;
about a great, worthless-fellow like me."&#xD;
" No, John," I answered, for the purpose&#xD;
of reassuring him. " You are mistaken. I&#xD;
haven't worried myself about you-oh, no--&#xD;
not in the least ! "&#xD;
I think this was about the most unmitigated&#xD;
falsehood I ever told in my life. I had wor-&#xD;
ried myself about him until I was fairly sick,&#xD;
and no number of doses of valerian except&#xD;
that single one of seeing John enter the door,&#xD;
as he had now done, would have been effect-&#xD;
ual in calming my agitated nerves. I don't&#xD;
believe people's hair turns gray from agony.&#xD;
For the last two hours I had seen my John&#xD;
run over and killed by every individual and&#xD;
respective horse-car in town, as well as maim-&#xD;
ed by two trucks, and drowned off one fer-&#xD;
ry-boat, and yet my hair was as brown and&#xD;
silky as ever ! Never tell me! I don't be-&#xD;
lieve a word of their stupid stories!&#xD;
"In the first place," said John, stirring&#xD;
his coffee and then drinking it down without&#xD;
taking the spoon from the cup:  in the first&#xD;
place I've worked like a horse to-day, and&#xD;
old Williamson is just tickled to death with&#xD;
nie. He says to une, says he, 'By George !&#xD;
John Morris, you'll be a rich man some day,&#xD;
sir, if you keep on.' And I don't wonder'&#xD;
lie's pleased, for, oh, Nelly ! she is beauti-&#xD;
ful!"&#xD;
" Is she, John? " said I, for I knew to&#xD;
whom.he alluded without questioning.&#xD;
"Yes; if you could see her sitting the&#xD;
water like a duck, and with her slender masts&#xD;
cleaving the air and pointing to the sky as&#xD;
though to remind us that up there lived the&#xD;
Great Boss-the great, great One, Nell,&#xD;
whose poor frail journeymen we all are.&#xD;
Kiss me, my girl."&#xD;
I knew this was coming. John .always&#xD;
had to be kissed whenever he grew moraliz-&#xD;
ing, reflective or theological; his great warm&#xD;
heart was flowing over with love, and his&#xD;
dear nature was one of that entwining har-&#xD;
acter which finds joy in every outward ex-&#xD;
pression of affection.&#xD;
" I'm going up to kiss Baby !" And with-&#xD;
out another word he departed on his errand,&#xD;
leaving me in an agony of fear-lest lie&#xD;
should wake her and give me a sleepy, cross&#xD;
child to nurse during the rest of the evening.&#xD;
He soon returned, however, having accom-&#xD;
plished his purpose without any disagreeable&#xD;
consequences.&#xD;
" To-day we put up the figger-head. It's&#xD;
a woman. They call her Amandy, because&#xD;
that's the name of old Wxilliamson's daughter;&#xD;
and he told the carver-fellows to make the&#xD;
figger-head look like bier. But, Lord bless&#xD;
you, it's oceans too pretty for that proud&#xD;

thing, with a stuck-up nose. It's a regular&#xD;
beauty. Nell, it looks like you."&#xD;
"Nonsense, John," said I. But I was&#xD;
mightily pleased nevertheless. If he had&#xD;
said I looked like the ship itself, I should have&#xD;
been pleased; because I knew that anything&#xD;
about a boat or a boat's gear was handsome&#xD;
to a man who loved his trade, and whose&#xD;
trade was that of a ship-carpenter, as my&#xD;
husband's was.&#xD;
" Well, all that kept me late ; and just as&#xD;
I was coining away, worried myself because&#xD;
I knew you'd be worried about me, I met&#xD;
Mr. Williamson, who called out to me by&#xD;
name. ' Morris,' says he, ' here's a letter&#xD;
that I think is for you. The address is writ-&#xD;
ten in such a scrawly little bit of a hand'&#xD;
(rilliamson's fist, you know, is as big as an&#xD;
elephant's) ' that I can scarcely make it out.&#xD;
Still I think it's for you.'&#xD;
It was for me, Nell," continued John;&#xD;
" It was a letter from California."&#xD;
'California, John ! Who do you know&#xD;
in California? "&#xD;
"It was 'from an old aunt of mine, who&#xD;
went there years and years ago. I have but&#xD;
very little recollection of her-except that&#xD;
she was kind ,and gentle to me when I was&#xD;
a boy. She was my poor mother's favorite&#xD;
sister. Poor mother! Kiss me, Nell. Well,&#xD;
Aunt Julia married and went away ; and the&#xD;
next ,I heard of her was that her husband&#xD;
had died, and left her a great fortune. Soon&#xD;
after that we heard she had foolishly em-&#xD;
barked all her money in a speculation which&#xD;
proved disastrous, and she'now writes to me&#xD;
to ask me if I can't give her a home for the&#xD;
rest of her days, to shelter her old age from&#xD;
suffering and want."&#xD;
"And how did you answer, John? " I&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
"I haven't answered at all yet. I waited to&#xD;
see what my little wife would say about it."&#xD;
Iccrept up to him stealthily and, getting very&#xD;
close, placed my nose under his soft whiskers,&#xD;
thus bringing my lips almost in contact with&#xD;
his ear.&#xD;
" Your little wife says that so long as she&#xD;
has a roof to shelter her, or crust of bread&#xD;
to eat, she will share both with any kith or&#xD;
kin of John Morris's."&#xD;
I shan't tell you any more that he said, for&#xD;
he always overrated everything I did ; nor&#xD;
how he kissed iie and put his arm around my&#xD;
slender waist (twenty inches my waist i ibbon&#xD;
measured--ha ! ha ! just look at me now) and&#xD;
called me " his darling-his true little wife-&#xD;
his own dear helpmate !"  It was a good&#xD;
deal of undertaking for us, dears, for we&#xD;
were both young, and expenses were heavy.&#xD;
All we had in t he world was John's wages,&#xD;
though,.to be sure, we were rent free, for the&#xD;
little band box of a house we lived in b~eloni--&#xD;
ed to me, having been left me by my grai-&#xD;
father. We hail, too, otir little child's future&#xD;
to think of:4t had alwavs been niy hope to&#xD;
be able to leave her something. But all coii-&#xD;
&#xD;
t1S'S MONEY.                             5&#xD;
siderations, even those of our child's pros-&#xD;
pects, must fade before the touching appeal&#xD;
made us by this friendless, aged woman.&#xD;
Well, a letter was written and despat hed&#xD;
-a letter inviting poor Aunt Jiuia to come&#xD;
and stay with us as long as she lived, and en-&#xD;
closing her the money to pay her pai:age to&#xD;
New York (John had to work at outside jobs&#xD;
to get it), and in course of time she came to&#xD;
is-in course of a long, long time. One&#xD;
could not get to or from California as one&#xD;
can now, in a matter of three weeks or so.&#xD;
It took months. The winter had gone and&#xD;
the snow-flakes had melted, and the Alay&#xD;
blossoms had faded, and then the June roses&#xD;
came, and with them )oor Aunt ,Julia.  She&#xD;
was a fragile, delicate woman of piast sixty,&#xD;
with mild blue eyes, whit h positively beam-&#xD;
ed, as my John's did, on every hinnm  crea-&#xD;
ture on vbich they rested. 1er voice was&#xD;
soft and low and mellow; and, alas ! alas ! I&#xD;
saw at once what she said in her letter--hat&#xD;
her home with us and on the earth, iideed,&#xD;
would not be for long.&#xD;
Aunty and I got on famously. Baby evi-&#xD;
dently regarded this new comer as a valuable&#xD;
importation brought expressly for her enjov-&#xD;
ient. During the summer lays Aunt .Jilia's&#xD;
life passoe1 pleasantly as heart could wish.&#xD;
She and baby sat in the summer-house, which&#xD;
John proudly called a " Bos-key," somebody&#xD;
having told him that that was the Frendh&#xD;
name for it. John built it himself, and I&#xD;
trained the vines to run over it and shade it-&#xD;
and if you'll believe me, in September, when&#xD;
the grapes weie ripe (we had a vine in our&#xD;
own yard), the great black bunches hung&#xD;
through the lattice-work, and danced before&#xD;
your eves and mouth as if they vere act mal-&#xD;
-ly inviting you to eat them. And, oh ! how&#xD;
luscious they were, too ! So ripe anl sweet&#xD;
and juicy.&#xD;
Aunt Julia spoke very little of her life in&#xD;
California, and out of delicacy I rerr'ained&#xD;
from mentioning it. On one subject she was&#xD;
very bitter. Before she had applied to John&#xD;
(knowing him to be poor) she hadt asked two&#xD;
others, the sole remaining anembers of' her&#xD;
family, to take her. They hail both relseid.&#xD;
John came gladly forward. That was not h-&#xD;
ing new for John. John was ready to assist&#xD;
everybody so far as his restricted means&#xD;
would allow ; but Aunt Julia (qhuh it inorin e&#xD;
this fact, was as deeply grateful to her'ntphiew&#xD;
as if the single act of'gotodncss in dhin's lif'&#xD;
had been performed for her and hr alone.&#xD;
As the winter advanced upon us, poor&#xD;
Aiiuntv's health grew worse and worse from&#xD;
day to day. Her eyes had failed her, and&#xD;
she could, therefore, neither read nor write&#xD;
noir sew.  "' What shall I do to amuse you&#xD;

Aunty. We've talked over everything you&#xD;
know,"                       11&#xD;
" Then make up something fresh, dear-&#xD;
make it up."&#xD;
" I'll tell you what," said John, whose&#xD;
voice sounded exactly like his aunt's, except&#xD;
that her's was very piano and his thunder-&#xD;
ingly forte-but they were both in the same&#xD;
key and both sweetly harmonious, at least&#xD;
to my ear! "Nell, you're such a wonder-&#xD;
ful hand at telling stories ! I hear you tel-&#xD;
ling them  to Baby all day long, about&#xD;
'Once upon a time there was. a little girl&#xD;
and she had a mother;' or, 'Once upon a&#xD;
time there lived a good man'-a circum-&#xD;
stance to be faithfully narrated on account of&#xD;
its rarity. Now suppose you devote every&#xD;
evening of Christmas week to telling Aunty&#xD;
and me a story ! Hey ! What do you say&#xD;
to that ? "&#xD;
" That would be delightful," said Aunt&#xD;
Julia.&#xD;
"Will you, Nell?" asked John.&#xD;
I said of' course I would, if I could amuse&#xD;
them. I would do anything for that purpose.&#xD;
They both knew that.&#xD;
"ha! Ha!" laughed John, slapping his&#xD;
leg as if this were a capital joke, "My&#xD;
little Nell giving us an Arabian night's en-&#xD;
tertainment. By jingo ! aint it jolly? I say&#xD;
Nelly, will you.write it off during the day?"&#xD;
"No," I replied, perking up my chin&#xD;
with a consciousnessof rather a high order&#xD;
of talent, hitherto unrecognized,; "no, I&#xD;
shall compose them as I go on-that is, ex-&#xD;
tempore."&#xD;
" Do so.   Bravo !" shouted be again,&#xD;
this time rubbing his hands together in quite&#xD;
a frantic manner. "Do so.   Do it, X-'&#xD;
anyway, and then it will be all the better for&#xD;
Xmas-don't you see ? Pick it and peck it,&#xD;
and mark it-don't you see ? and then it will&#xD;
do for everybody-and me! "&#xD;
The next evening was the first of the&#xD;
Christmas week. I had been thinking over&#xD;
our project all day, and when Baby was put&#xD;
to bed, and tea over, we all sat down quietly,&#xD;
and I was about to begin my story.&#xD;
But, bless you! before ever I opened my&#xD;
lips I saw that John had got at least a half&#xD;
o' ream o' paper before him, and more newly&#xD;
sharpened lead pencils than I ever before&#xD;
saw collected together, and was ready and&#xD;
eager to write down every word I said.&#xD;
I protested against this, but in vain. John&#xD;
would have his way. "I'm a reporter for a&#xD;
newspaper," he said, Aunt Julia laughing at&#xD;
his impudence. "I am obliged to report&#xD;
your speech, madam. Every great party&#xD;
has their speeches reported in the news-&#xD;
papers-particularly--if not more so, in ours.&#xD;
Our newspaper, Madam; our gigantic organ&#xD;
with a Hoe's Stop.   The Daily Blower.&#xD;
Circulation, three million !"&#xD;
" Now, John, this is too bad !" I ex-&#xD;
claimed, "You'll put me out !"&#xD;
&#xD;
"No I wont," he replied, "I'll put you&#xD;
in a book when you've done. Come now,&#xD;
don't be cross. What's your first story&#xD;
about? "&#xD;
" Never mind," said I, still unmollified, and&#xD;
wishing to give this " reporter" as little&#xD;
" information " as possible, "it's about-&#xD;
something."&#xD;
" I imagined it would be," said John.&#xD;
II.&#xD;
ABOUT SOMETHING,&#xD;
"You must give it a name, Nell," said my&#xD;
husband. " Come, now, christen it at once,&#xD;
and Aunt Julia and I will stand as spon-&#xD;
sors."&#xD;
"'I don't see why I need give it a name,&#xD;
John," I replied. "I haven't thought of&#xD;
one."&#xD;
"Now look, here, Madam," said John&#xD;
Morris, "if I do you the honor of taking&#xD;
down your stories with the ultimate view of-&#xD;
ahem-publishing them in book form-when I&#xD;
get money enough, the least you can do is&#xD;
to act on my reasonable suggestions. Every&#xD;
author does that."&#xD;
" Very well," said I, " if it must be, it&#xD;
must, Call it&#xD;
Roger Thornfield's Discovery.&#xD;
What did he discover, Nelly ?" asked&#xD;
my husband, laughing a little at my dignified&#xD;
manner, so different now to what it was&#xD;
when I was cooking batter-cakes.&#xD;
"Listen, and you will find out;" I answer-&#xD;
ed gravely&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
" BY Jove, Hartley ! I believe you are&#xD;
going to be the lucky one after all."&#xD;
What! do you think she really likes&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
" Likes you ! You don't mean to say you&#xD;
haven't yet asked her if she loves you? "&#xD;
"No; and I don't intend to do so!&#xD;
The answer was given in such a tone of-&#xD;
decision that conversation at once dropped,&#xD;
and the two men pursued their way in silence.&#xD;
The chill air of a November night blew&#xD;
around the sharp angles of the street corners&#xD;
as the first speaker-a gay, volatile youth of&#xD;
twenty-stopped at a door whose polished&#xD;
surface, bright silver knob and knocker, with&#xD;
appropriate continuance of spotless marble&#xD;
steps, was the fac simile of the next house,&#xD;
and the one next to that, and indeed formed&#xD;
one of a row of bewildering similarity.&#xD;
" Bless this stupid town !" exclaimed the&#xD;
younger man, inserting a small night-key in&#xD;
&#xD;
7&#xD;
&#xD;
the shining lock-" everybody abed at half&#xD;
past eleven! Good-night, Hartley."&#xD;
"Good-night," answered Hartley ; and&#xD;
turning up the collar of his overcoat, to pro-&#xD;
teet his ears from the cold and damp air of&#xD;
the foggy night, he quickened his pace till it&#xD;
became nearer a run than a walk, and in less&#xD;
than ten niinutes' time was warming his fin-&#xD;
ger-tips at a cheery fire which threw out so&#xD;
bright a glow that gas-light was quite unnec-&#xD;
essary in the room-one which formed the&#xD;
first of a suite of bachelor apartments.&#xD;
A very handsome man this Mr. Arthur&#xD;
Hartley, now that his overcoat has been re-&#xD;
moved and his hat laid aside, showing his high&#xD;
forehead, and his glossy hair, and the soft tinge&#xD;
of his delicate, olive complexion, and the fine&#xD;
silky black moustache and whiskers encir-&#xD;
cling the well-shaped chii. Something of an&#xD;
Italian face-soft but not effeminate ; an eye&#xD;
which could flash as well as plead; and a&#xD;
mouth a model of sweetness at times, now&#xD;
set-with heavy lines, and drawn harshly down&#xD;
at the corners. A man of about thirty-per-&#xD;
haps a couple of years more; but in his mo-&#xD;
ments of light-heartedness ten years of this&#xD;
seemed to vanish, and the face of a youth&#xD;
just Afage"was older than the face of&#xD;
lr1 A1tur Hartley. .&#xD;
The occupant of the suite of bachelor&#xD;
apartments was evidently not in a happy&#xD;
frame of mind ; for, flinging himself moodily&#xD;
in a comfortable easy chair, he gave vent to&#xD;
his annoyance by a series of ill-repressed&#xD;
sighs.&#xD;
Of course she loves me-" he muttered&#xD;
in a low tone-" of course she loves me-&#xD;
anybody can see that. She loves me madly,&#xD;
devotedly, insanely. Curse the luck !&#xD;
It seemed a strange thing to curse the&#xD;
luck which brought the love of a beautiful&#xD;
young girl; but doubtless Mr. Hartley had&#xD;
reasons of his own for speaking as he did,&#xD;
and for continuing in the following strain:&#xD;
Curse this stupid hole of a town too-if&#xD;
it were anywhere else I might-no, that 1&#xD;
could not exactly do; curse the town ! New&#xD;
York's the only place in the world fit to live&#xD;
in! "&#xD;
This was rather hard on London and Paris,&#xD;
and Vienna and Brussels, the. which cities&#xD;
are generelly supposed by their benighted in-&#xD;
habitants to be quite fit to live in ; but as in&#xD;
this country one's thoughts are free, Mr.&#xD;
Arthur Hartley was quitd entitled to the&#xD;
liberty of his opinion, particularly as it hap-&#xD;
pened to be expressed in the solitude of his&#xD;
own apartments and not before witnesses.&#xD;
.  I suppose I must go to bed now," said&#xD;
Hartley, casting a glance at his watch and&#xD;
closing the hunting-case with a snap which&#xD;
fell.onthe ear like the sharp click of a&#xD;
diminutive  pistol-" only halfipast twelve&#xD;
and going to bed ! Oh Lord ! how supremely&#xD;
virtuous I am getting ! I wish I could see&#xD;
what is goimg on in New York."&#xD;
&#xD;
That lie could not perform this visual feat&#xD;
seemed to be another cause of complaint&#xD;
against a life in Philadelphia, and Mr. Hart-&#xD;
ley entering an inner room, began divesting&#xD;
himself of his coat and waistcoat in a drearily&#xD;
discontented manner.&#xD;
" I wonder if I dare go to see her to-mor-&#xD;
row. Dare ! One dare do anything with a&#xD;
woman who is madly, insanely in love."&#xD;
He paused.&#xD;
Is she in love with me ?&#xD;
Another pause.&#xD;
"Yes, to be sure she is," answered Mr.&#xD;
Hartley to Mr. Hartley. " I wish I were as&#xD;
sure of everything as I am of that. Madly,&#xD;
insanely, furiously, outrageously, absurdly&#xD;
in love with me. And I can do anything I&#xD;
please with her. He chuckled at this and&#xD;
repeated the words-" anything I please&#xD;
with her."&#xD;
Mr. Hartley did not quickly compose his&#xD;
restless brain to sleep. Ite tossed in the&#xD;
bed, and crumpled the white covers, and&#xD;
twisted the highly-fluted pillow-slips in his&#xD;
hot hands. aid chuckled exultingly at the last&#xD;
little idea which had come across his fertile&#xD;
brain.&#xD;
He repeated it in his waking intervals,&#xD;
which were many during the night ; and the&#xD;
trim  little chambermail, who rapped at&#xD;
his door at 8 o'clock I the next morning&#xD;
and announced boots and hot water, uis-&#xD;
tinctly avers that she heard Mr. Hartley em-&#xD;
phatically asserting that he could do--" any-&#xD;
thing-he-pleased-with-h-er."&#xD;
CHAPTER IL.   I&#xD;
IT is generally considered a fine tling to&#xD;
be born rich ; and a fine thing to he horn&#xD;
handsome ; and better, perhaps than either,&#xD;
to be amiable and loving and beloved. All&#xD;
this was Ruth Villemain, and a very lucky&#xD;
girl she esteemed herself, when at the age&#xD;
ofeighteen, just entering upon life,-its pleas-&#xD;
ures and. its woes, she saw how unmnistak-.&#xD;
ably superior was her position to that of&#xD;
most girls about her. Her parents, both&#xD;
rich, died before Ruth had reached her&#xD;
sixth year, and froni that age till woman-&#xD;
hood the girl had been made to feel how&#xD;
great was the power conferred by fortune ;&#xD;
and when, with this, dawned upon her the&#xD;
knowledge that great personal loveliness was&#xD;
hers as well, it might have been overlooked&#xD;
and pardoned if herl head had been soiiie-&#xD;
what turned by the brilliancy of her position.&#xD;
But it was not so in the least. A more&#xD;
beautiful character, joined to a more lovely&#xD;
form and face, it would he dificult to find.&#xD;
iundeedl, part of her beauty , was decrivedl&#xD;
from her charm of manner. Such a shy,&#xD;

JOHN MORRIS'S MONEY.&#xD;
&#xD;
tender little way she had of supplicating&#xD;
your friendship by a loving glance from her&#xD;
soft, dreamy blue, eyes ! Such a warm smile&#xD;
dallied on her rosy lips, parted just enough&#xD;
to show the pearly whiteness of the teeth&#xD;
inside ! Her form, too, more mature than&#xD;
is usual with girls of her years, was molded&#xD;
with a correctness seen but rarely now-a-days&#xD;
in this, our age, when, bodily distortion is the&#xD;
rule to which women must fain submit.&#xD;
There was nothing very brilliant in Ruth&#xD;
Villemain's mental qualifications. She had&#xD;
been a good little girl at school, and learned&#xD;
her lessons and got good marks and been&#xD;
obedient generally ; and later on she had&#xD;
taken prizes for lessons, and then at length&#xD;
graduated. Not brilliantly at all, but she&#xD;
had graduated; and, so considered, she had&#xD;
performed the necessary and disagreeable&#xD;
scholastic duties incumbent on a young lady&#xD;
of her position in life. She said she did not&#xD;
rely on her brilliancy to be loved, but on&#xD;
the hopeful theory-that loving every one&#xD;
herself, all would love her in return-as we&#xD;
are told that like invariably begets like.&#xD;
And it did in her case, very, very fully.&#xD;
Not one of the many persons who knew her&#xD;
even made the effort to withstand her power&#xD;
-the power of love, and truth, and virtue,&#xD;
and honor.&#xD;
She had had many suitors and had reject-&#xD;
ed all who had offered themselves ; but this&#xD;
with so much gentleness, tenderness, even&#xD;
affection, that not one among them had seen&#xD;
fit to be indignant, or scornful, or anything&#xD;
but just forever and ever her devoted friend&#xD;
and loyal knight. There were many who&#xD;
were this, too, without having offered them-&#xD;
selves ; and among these was one Roger&#xD;
Thornfield, a thoughtful, young man of twen-&#xD;
ty-five, who had known Ruth Villemain to his&#xD;
pleasure, as a child, and now knew her, to&#xD;
his sorrow, as a woman. To his sorrow,&#xD;
because he too felt the influence which none&#xD;
could escape who came in contact with her;&#xD;
to his sorrow, because he knew that the day&#xD;
was not far distant when some preux cheva-&#xD;
lier would come prancing by on his figurative&#xD;
milk-white steed and capture the pretty little&#xD;
Pastoral maiden, Ruth Villemain.&#xD;
As yet, however, Ruth did not seem likely&#xD;
to be captured. The figurative milk-white&#xD;
steeds pranced on the scene and off, and&#xD;
there was an end of them.&#xD;
Seeing this, Roger Thornfield's great heart&#xD;
grew light and joyous, and one day, survey-&#xD;
ing his comely young face in his mirror, a&#xD;
smile flitted across his lips-a smile of joy-&#xD;
and he said gayly-" Can it be possible that&#xD;
dear Ruth could-could-"&#xD;
Here his feelings were evidently too much&#xD;
for him, for his heart came high up in his&#xD;
throat and choked his utterance.&#xD;
Ah hope! hope ! springing eternal in the&#xD;
human breast, what flattering tales hadst thou&#xD;
been wrhispering to poor Roger Thornfield ?&#xD;
WI~hate ver they were, they soon faded and&#xD;
&#xD;
-died,'for Roger's countenance lost its bright-&#xD;
ness, and an expression of anxiety-almost&#xD;
pain came across the pale but manly young&#xD;
face. "It is a hard thing to be poor," he&#xD;
soliloquized sadly-" a very hard thing to be&#xD;
poor-harder for a woman, of course, than a&#xD;
man ; hard enough for a man, too, under any&#xD;
circumstances ; but undbr these which sur-&#xD;
round me now, to know and feel that the&#xD;
iron hand of poverty has me, and will have&#xD;
me forever in its grip, while the woman I&#xD;
love is heiress to two fortunes, and can scarce-&#xD;
ly be approached by a man in my position&#xD;
without the fear of his being considered a&#xD;
fortune-seeker, and as such discarded, of&#xD;
course-oh, it is hard-hard-hard to bear."&#xD;
That the man felt what he said was evident;&#xD;
for he buried his face in his hands, and a few&#xD;
hot tears trickled between his fingers, leaving&#xD;
their traces too on the yet unfurrowed cheeks.&#xD;
"Come what may," said be, rising, "I&#xD;
will tell her that I love her. I will see what&#xD;
answer she will make. She cannot-it is im-&#xD;
possible that she should for one moment&#xD;
doubt the disinterestedness of the love of her&#xD;
old friend, Roger Thornfield."&#xD;
How well he knew the path from the little&#xD;
unfrequented northern thoroughfare. contigu-&#xD;
ous to unpleasant railways and verging close-,&#xD;
ly on the confines of nowhere, bounded on&#xD;
all sides by roystering beer-gardens and&#xD;
bare-headed, ill-kempt children-from the&#xD;
place in fact which was his home, to the fine,&#xD;
wide, well-graded thoroughfare running from&#xD;
river to river, where stood the .house, one of&#xD;
the legacies of Ruth Villemain, and now oc-&#xD;
cupied by the girl and an invalid aunt-a suf-&#xD;
fering and rather ill-tempered lady, who had&#xD;
been transplanted from her native soil in the&#xD;
interior of the State, to the utterly uncon-&#xD;
genial atmosphere (to her) of Philadelphia&#xD;
life.&#xD;
" My dear," said the poor lady, in a con-&#xD;
stant state of protest against .balls, and op-&#xD;
eras, and dinners and theatres-" my (lear&#xD;
Ruth, we never do this sort of thing in the&#xD;
country."&#xD;
" No Aunty, I suppose not," replied the&#xD;
girl laughing; " hut don't you sometimes&#xD;
wish you could?"&#xD;
Roger Thornfield's timid ring at the en-&#xD;
trance door was answered by a man servant,&#xD;
who had been lolling in easy indifference on&#xD;
a hall-way chair.&#xD;
Is Miss Villemain at home? " inquired&#xD;
Mr. -Thornfield.&#xD;
"I don't know, sir;- but I'll see," was the&#xD;
answer ; a palpable falsehood, for even as&#xD;
the words were being uttered, Ruth's merry&#xD;
laugh was heard in the drawing room.&#xD;
The well.trained servant showed no&#xD;
token of being diseoncerted at this incident,&#xD;
but, quietly entering the room where Ruth&#xD;
wvas siting, inquired, in his usual lazy way,&#xD;
if " Miss Villenmain was at home-to Mr.&#xD;
Thornfield !"&#xD;
Miss Villemain answered in the affirmative&#xD;
&#xD;
JOHN MORRIS'S MONEY.&#xD;
&#xD;
at once ; but before the man had time to take&#xD;
the message Ruth stopped him.&#xD;
Wait a minute, Williams."&#xD;
The man bowed and stood still.&#xD;
"Oh no, no, Mr. Hartley," answeredRuth,&#xD;
mn reply to some whispered words from that&#xD;
gentleman, who was sitting near her. " I&#xD;
can't send away my old friend Roger Thorn-&#xD;
field."&#xD;
Mr. Hartley bit his lip, and looked 6ut of&#xD;
the drawing-room window into the conserva-&#xD;
tory beyond. "Show Mr. Thornfield in,"&#xD;
said Miss Villemain ; but even as she gave&#xD;
the order she looked up uneasily at her com-&#xD;
pamon.&#xD;
"'I suppose you consider me very unrea-&#xD;
sonable, Miss Villemain," said the latter,&#xD;
when the servant was out of hearing dis-&#xD;
tance.&#xD;
Yes indeed," answered Ruth, laughing,&#xD;
very unreasonable to expect me to discard&#xD;
poor Roger, who never did you any harm-"&#xD;
" Upon my word," said Hartley, assuming&#xD;
a sneering expression not very pleasant to&#xD;
see, " how poetical you are getting ! You&#xD;
really recall souvenirs of Mother Goose !"&#xD;
" What is it.&#xD;
"Never did him any harm-&#xD;
'Ah, yes ..&#xD;
',-What a naughty boy was that&#xD;
To drown poor pussy cat&#xD;
Who never did him any harm,&#xD;
-      But killed the rats in his father's barn-'&#xD;
"Mr.. Thornfield ! "announced the servant,&#xD;
opening the drawing room door to admit the&#xD;
gentleman who had been the subject of dis-&#xD;
course between Mr. Hartley and Miss Vil-&#xD;
lentin.&#xD;
" I am fortunate in finding you at home,"&#xD;
said Roger ''hornfield, bowing.to the pretty&#xD;
girl who extended her hand kindly to him.&#xD;
Yes indeed," she replied ; "~ one has so&#xD;
many engagements out, during the season."&#xD;
"Bless ie ! " ejaculated Hlartlev with a&#xD;
surprised air; '' is there a ' season in Phila-&#xD;
delphia? "&#xD;
'' To be sure there is, you rude man. I&#xD;
positively cannot allow you to villify our&#xD;
dear old town so mnch. Mr. Thornfield,&#xD;
Mr. Hartley-Mr. Iartley, Mr. Thornfield.&#xD;
Indeed, I don't know which of you is the&#xD;
greater personage, and therefore amn in doubt&#xD;
which name to mention first in ' introduc-&#xD;
ing'"-&#xD;
He is the greater personage who en-.&#xD;
joys your greater friendship," said Thorn-&#xD;
field, glancing i ip at her, full of the love which&#xD;
was the ruling sentiuient of his life, and had&#xD;
been for ten years back.&#xD;
A  comipimueint from you, Mr. Thorn-&#xD;
field! " said Ruth, smiling. " I never expec-&#xD;
ted it."&#xD;
It wvas quite evidenit Mr. Hartley also didh&#xD;
not expect it, for lhe looked excessively&#xD;
bored, andl even ill teimpe~red, at Rogrer&#xD;
Thcornfield-.&#xD;

There was an awkward pause for a few&#xD;
seconds, during   which lRoger  Thornifield&#xD;
looked very love-guilty, and Arthur Ilartley&#xD;
continued to look very bored.&#xD;

him in part, and succeeded in bringing his&#xD;
chair closer to the piano stool.&#xD;
" Ruth," said he, drawing a long breath.&#xD;
" I've got something very serious to say to&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"Oh, Roger !" exclaimed the girl, giving&#xD;
a sudden twirl to the stool, thus bringing per-&#xD;
self face to face with him ; "oh, please don't&#xD;
say anything serious. I can't bear anything&#xD;
serious. Now there's Aunty-she's always&#xD;
serious-you are serious. I must say I do&#xD;
like Mr. Hartley, if for no other reason than&#xD;
that he is never serious. He is always light-&#xD;
hearted and happy and gay. I love people&#xD;
who are light-hearted and gay."&#xD;
Poor Roger ! He stood little chance of&#xD;
being loved just then by this token ; for&#xD;
his pale young face was the very picture of&#xD;
despair.&#xD;
"Ruth," he continued, nothing daunted,&#xD;
" I must speak to you to-day. That is, if&#xD;
you'll let me. May I?"&#xD;
"Certainly, Roger," she answered naively.&#xD;
What about-? "&#xD;
" About---about-Ruth, did it never strike&#xD;
you how very dear you are to me ? "&#xD;
"Yes, Roger," she answered ; " you are&#xD;
very good to me-so is every one about me;&#xD;
they all love me-even Aunty, I believe-&#xD;
that is, when she is well enough."&#xD;
" But, Ruth, I don't want you to class me&#xD;
with the general throng. I am a plain man,&#xD;
and can make no flowery speeches. I think&#xD;
you know that I am honest and upright and&#xD;
sincere. So much I will say, although it&#xD;
sounds like self-praise. And, Ruth, I love&#xD;
you very, very deeply. I have done so ever&#xD;
since I knew what love was-yes, and before&#xD;
that period, too, when you were a sweet&#xD;
young child, and I was not many years your&#xD;
, senior-even then you were dearer to me&#xD;
than any living, breathing thing on the face&#xD;
of the earth. Now, since I have come to&#xD;
be a man, I know that my whole life is cen-&#xD;
tered in you, and that to possess your love&#xD;
would make me happier than any king who&#xD;
wields a scepter. I can't be eloquent, Ruth-&#xD;
it is not in me; but I feel-1.feel what I&#xD;
say, God knows how deeply ! Therefore,&#xD;
clearest, if you can find it in your heart to&#xD;
give me any hope that at some future time,&#xD;
by devotion or self-denial, or what you will.&#xD;
I may, oh, Ruth! possess your love, you&#xD;
can change a life, which hitherto has been&#xD;
nothing but one of sadness and misery, into&#xD;
anexistence as bright and joyous as that of&#xD;
birds flitting about in the unchanging sun-&#xD;
shine of a tropical clime."&#xD;
His voice had quite died away before he&#xD;
looked up in 'her face for a reply. None&#xD;
came.&#xD;
" Ruth," he repeated, after a pause -&#xD;
Ruth, will you not answer me ? "&#xD;
Her only answer was a burst of tears,&#xD;
which frighitenedl pour Roger to such an ex-&#xD;
tenut that lie rushed to her, and throwing hinm-&#xD;
&#xD;
self on his knees before her, begged her for-&#xD;
giveness for what he had said.&#xD;
" Roger," she replied at length, wiping&#xD;
away the tears. "Ihave nothing to forgive--&#xD;
indeed it is I alone who am toblame. I should&#xD;
have shown you-"&#xD;
" What? " he exclaimed, rising and pac-&#xD;
ing the floor excitedly-" that the difference,&#xD;
between our relative positions is too great&#xD;
for me to aspire to your hand--that you are&#xD;
rich, and I poor? "&#xD;
"No, no," she answered quickly;- " noth-&#xD;
ing of the kind. Oh, Roger ! why did you not&#xD;
speak thus to me three months ago ? Then&#xD;
my answer would have been different. Of&#xD;
all the men I have ever known you were the&#xD;
one whom I always preferred until-until-"&#xD;
Her voice sank, and she lowered her eyes&#xD;
as Roger Thornfeld stopped pacing the floor&#xD;
and fixed a piercing gaze upon her face.&#xD;
"Until what, Ruth?" he inquired    at&#xD;
length.&#xD;
She made no reply.&#xD;
" Oh. Ruth," he said, " don't give me only&#xD;
half confidence. Kill me if so it must be,&#xD;
but do not let me linger in agony. Slay me&#xD;
at once."&#xD;
" You must help me then Roger," said&#xD;
the girl, sadly.          '&#xD;
"Is it," he said, in a tremulous voice,&#xD;
that you love some one else?"&#xD;
"Yes, oh yes," she answered-" so dear-&#xD;
ly ! so very, very dearly."&#xD;
He shrank away from her as she uttered&#xD;
the words, and bowed his head in silence.&#xD;
"You insisted on knowing, Roger," she&#xD;
said, perceiving his distress.    "&#xD;
" It is better I .should know," he an-&#xD;
swered. "Will you extend t9e confidence ?"&#xD;
" Yes."&#xD;
" His name is -&#xD;
" Arthur Hartley."&#xD;
" What!" he exclaimed, springing up as&#xD;
if an electric battery had touched him. " The&#xD;
man who has just left us? "&#xD;
She bowed her head in token of aitrma-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
" Why, Ruth," said Roger. " I never&#xD;
heard of the man before to-day. Who is he P"&#xD;
" I don't know," she replied.&#xD;
" What is lie?'"&#xD;
"I don't care."-&#xD;
"What is his parentageP "&#xD;
" I never inquired."&#xD;
" His antecedents?"&#xD;
" I have to do with his future, not his&#xD;
past."&#xD;
" Then you are fixed in this ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Roger, fixed as fate."&#xD;
" You love him "&#xD;
" Oh yes, Roger, more, much more than&#xD;
I can ever tell you."&#xD;
She clasped her hands together and cast&#xD;
her eyes upward, standing for sonicnioments&#xD;
rapt in the eestacy of a young girl's first&#xD;
love. This being, it was tnot strange that the&#xD;
&#xD;
emotion which was racking the breast of&#xD;
poor Roger Thornfield passed without com-&#xD;
ment or observance on the part of Ruth Vil-&#xD;
lemain.&#xD;
That is Aunty's voice," said she, as the&#xD;
tones of a lady, complaining of the servants,&#xD;
were heard in the hall-way.&#xD;
"1Yes, Ruth, and I am in no mood to meet&#xD;
Mrs. Whining. You must forgive me for&#xD;
all I have said to you to-day. Believe me, if&#xD;
I had known your state of feeling, I never&#xD;
should have intruded upon you wha t must&#xD;
have been a very annoying avowal. But&#xD;
this much I will add to what I have already&#xD;
said: howsoever coldly you may regard me,&#xD;
my love for you will never change. It will&#xD;
last as long as I last, Iuth, and that perhaps&#xD;
will not be for a great length of time. Ruth,&#xD;
you are without -male relatives of any kind.&#xD;
Will you let me-me, your old friend Rog-&#xD;
er Thornfield-will you let me be your&#xD;
brother ?"&#xD;
It was not a great deal to ask, but Ruth&#xD;
hung her head and was silent for a moment.&#xD;
At length, she answered,&#xD;
"4Brothers are-are so annoyingly zealous&#xD;
sometimes,. Roger."&#xD;
"Do you fear that zeal which shall be di-&#xD;
rected in a certain quarter, Ruth ? "&#xD;
" No," she answered, vehemently. " Be&#xD;
as zealous as ycu like; investigate, inquire,&#xD;
probe, look into-do what you please."&#xD;
" And if the result of all this is unfavora-&#xD;
ble?"&#xD;
"6Roger," answered the girl with great&#xD;
gravity, and for the first time. seeking his&#xD;
glance and meeting it boldly, " 1 love hin;&#xD;
nothing can change ie."&#xD;
And you will marry him?"&#xD;
"Yes-if he asks me. He has not done&#xD;
so yet."&#xD;
There was nothing to be said, and Roge&#xD;
said nothing. But he pressed her small hand&#xD;
very tenderly as he left her, and, with hit&#xD;
eyes blinded with tears, rushed past Mrs&#xD;
Whining in the hall, without even so mie&#xD;
as bowing to the lady.&#xD;
How frightfully rude these healthy peo&#xD;
ple are ! " said Mrs. Whining entering th&#xD;
drawing-room with a languid step. "Now&#xD;
my dear Ruth, there is your friend who ha&#xD;
just left you-Mr. Rosefield-oh, no, I meai&#xD;
Thornfield-and a very nice person too,I&#xD;
dare say, only lie is so very healthy--so in&#xD;
tolerably strong, my dear. Not that I alto&#xD;
gether blame him for it, but he is made o&#xD;
iron, Ruth. I have not the slightest doub&#xD;
that a post mortem examination on the bod&#xD;
of that young man would disclose nothing&#xD;
but iron. Did you hear how lie banged th&#xD;
front door, my dear? AL me ! a few mor&#xD;
such bangs as that will lay me in my grave&#xD;
Won't you  lie down on this couch&#xD;
Aunt?" said Ruth, drawing tup a divan.&#xD;
" Yes, dear-and if you would he goo&#xD;
enough to fan me--that cushion-put it&#xD;
&#xD;
little hiigher-also salts ; here, inrmy dress&#xD;
pocket-thank you ! Not quite so violent&#xD;
with the fan. There, like that-yes, thank&#xD;
you. Do you know Ruth, dear, you are a&#xD;
charming girl-so many delightful qualities&#xD;
you know. But you have one which is per-&#xD;
fectly invaluable to me. Can't think what it&#xD;
is, do you say?   Well, I'll tell you-you&#xD;
never thump chairs."&#xD;
A bitter smile crossed Ruth's featiris, as&#xD;
the langid lady sank back again on the&#xD;
couch, crushing the rich paraphernala of her&#xD;
toilette and making a coverlid of her gaudy&#xD;
Cashmere shawl. Ruth plied the fai con-&#xD;
stantly, however, and once or twice placed&#xD;
the flagon of salts under the delicate nostril&#xD;
of the invalid lady.&#xD;
To tell you," said the latter, opining her&#xD;
eyes, and holding on high a thin white fin-&#xD;
ger literally sparkling with gems-'' to tell&#xD;
you how I appreciate a person who does not&#xD;
thump chairs is quite out of my power !&#xD;
Why, do you know what my brother-your&#xD;
poor dear father, Ruth-do you know what&#xD;
he (lied of ? Ile died of the thunip of a&#xD;
chair. He did, truly, my dear. Ile wasn't&#xD;
very well one day, and some wretched healthy&#xD;
person cane in to see hiu, and thumped a&#xD;
chair, whereupon your father instantly cx-&#xD;
pired. Can you now understand why it is&#xD;
so unpleasant to me, to be in contact with&#xD;
healthy people?"&#xD;
 But, dear Aunt," said Ruth, in a tote&#xD;
of apology, and as if the avowal was one&#xD;
which reflected great discredit on herself.&#xD;
" I am a very healthy person,"&#xD;
Yes, you are, Ruth. But at least you&#xD;
are a considerate person. It was the same&#xD;
way with my husband, Mr. Whining; he was&#xD;
a very healthy person ; save for that, he was&#xD;
a gentleman. He saw it was impossible for&#xD;
r so much health to get along with so much ill-&#xD;
Iness, and one (lay was thrown off his horse,&#xD;
s and died from his injuries. Ile never could&#xD;
. have died in any other way, dear, he was so&#xD;
h strong. It was rather unfeeling in hii, pci-&#xD;
haps, to give me the violent shock of seeing&#xD;
- hin brought home dead ; but the horse slip-&#xD;
e pel, it appears, and therefore it was iiot alto-&#xD;
 gether Mr. W-'s fault. I tilt his death, of&#xD;
s course, very noueh ; but I must say I should&#xD;
n have respected his memory more if he had&#xD;
I not been so very healthy. Why, do you&#xD;
- know, my dear," continued the widow, partly&#xD;
- rising, supporting her dehicate frame on her&#xD;
f elbow, and lowering her voice as if she werc&#xD;
t telling some thrilling "'sensation " story, "'hlie&#xD;
y never took a blue pill in his life !&#xD;

e which was always sadly imperiled    when&#xD;

CHAPTER. III.&#xD;
ROGER TIIoRNhIEL   left Ruth's presence&#xD;
under the influence of two very strong feel-&#xD;
ings. The first was of course his love for&#xD;
lier-that neither her refusal of him nor her&#xD;
passionate avowal of love for another could&#xD;
change in the slightest degree. All hope of&#xD;
ever aspiring to the bliss of being her hus-&#xD;
band had vanished. She had said it could&#xD;
never be, and thus he knew he might not&#xD;
even hope for the future. But oh ! it was&#xD;
heart-breaking to remember she biad said,&#xD;
that had he pressed his claim three months&#xD;
before-ere this man Hartley had crossed&#xD;
her path --her answer would have been&#xD;
different. Fool! fool that he was ! Why&#xD;
had he not been less tardy ? He loved her&#xD;
then as dearly as now; he had failed to&#xD;
speak, a new sentiment had filled her breast,&#xD;
and now Roger Thornfield's doom was&#xD;
sealed.&#xD;
Next to the overweening bitterness that&#xD;
this knowledge brought. came an unquenchi-&#xD;
able desire to know something more of the&#xD;
muan who had succeeded in obtaining the&#xD;
love of this pure and beautiful girl. It was&#xD;
evident his history was unknown to Ruth&#xD;
Villemain ; she in her blind love had never&#xD;
inquired into his past, and would doubtless re-&#xD;
sent what she called " annoying zeal," if she&#xD;
saw any show of " probing Hartley's antece-&#xD;
dents " on the' part of her old friend. This,&#xD;
however, did not deter Thornfield from nak-&#xD;
ing an imward vow that lie would not rest&#xD;
quiet, day or night, until he obtained some&#xD;
knowledge of the character of the man whose&#xD;
wife Ruth -his sweet young friend, the&#xD;
woman t(e so devotedly wor-shipped-lhad&#xD;
avowed herself willing to become, and that&#xD;
too, merely for the asking.&#xD;
How was this to be accomplished  IHow&#xD;
was it possible for poor young Thornfield,&#xD;
without resources of money or power, confin-&#xD;
ed by business the greater part of the day in&#xD;
the quiet and respectable city of Philadel-&#xD;
phia, to learn aiiy thing of the habits or&#xD;
haunts ofthis gay New Yorker who had mere-&#xD;
ly visited Philadelphia for a "1 joke " i nthe&#xD;
first place, met Ruth Villemain by accident,&#xD;
and since that time made a few flying visits to&#xD;
the town avowedly. (so le told Miss Ville-&#xD;
main's friends), of being near the lady whose&#xD;
charms had had so potent an effect on the&#xD;
handsome Hartley. Trne, he had taken a&#xD;
bachelor's suite ofapartments and comfortably&#xD;
installed himself, so as to avoil those "' hor-&#xD;
rid caravanseries " the hotels, when he did&#xD;
come to Philadelphia, which was seldom,&#xD;
Thornfield's acquaintance im New York was&#xD;
of the most limited character. A few steaily-&#xD;
going mercantile men who did business with&#xD;
the house in Philadelphia to which Thorn.,&#xD;
field was attached, heads of .fa milies whose&#xD;
lives wvere passed between thie busy str-eet&#xD;
"down town," where they- tr-ansacted busi-&#xD;
&#xD;
ness, and the quiet little cottage somewhere&#xD;
out of town to which they retired after busi-&#xD;
ness hours. It was hardly likely these peo-&#xD;
ple could furnish any information of the&#xD;
handsome butterfly man whose gaudy wings&#xD;
had attracted Ruth. On application, Roger&#xD;
found what he had fully expected-that no&#xD;
one knew any thing about Mr. Arthur Hart-&#xD;
ley.&#xD;
Since the day of her confession to him,&#xD;
Thornfield had never crossed the threshold of&#xD;
Ruth Villemain's door  He ftlt, as vet, that&#xD;
he was too unnerved to meet her. Besides,&#xD;
what availed such meetings ?  Iartley's hold&#xD;
on her affections was without doubt strength&#xD;
enino every day, and Roger, powerless to&#xD;
show this man iii another form than that in&#xD;
which he showed himself, knew well that any&#xD;
foreboding of a lack of honesty or upright-&#xD;
ness uibacked by authentic proof, would be&#xD;
laughed to scorn  by  the infatuated girl.&#xD;
Thornfiehl's love for ler was one of self-deny-&#xD;
ing purity, and had lie once been convinced&#xD;
that this man Hartley was worthy the enviable&#xD;
position he was to occupy as the husband of&#xD;
the young heiress, Roger' Thornifiel would&#xD;
have been the first to go to lis long-time&#xD;
friend and congratulate on her choice. For&#xD;
now it was currently reported that Ruth and&#xD;
Hartley were engaged, and would shortly he&#xD;
married. The news had spread like wild&#xD;
fire, and been received first with astonishment,&#xD;
then with disbelief; and then, when disbelief&#xD;
was no longer possible, with great disdain,&#xD;
by Ruth's aristocratic friends. Who was this&#xD;
man ?  Who    knew  him ?  Nobody; and&#xD;
strange to say, Thornfield's niisgivimgs of ins&#xD;
previous good character were sliared by&#xD;
every one who iet hii. By every one ex-&#xD;
cept Ruth who, it was said, became more&#xD;
and more attached to hii every day.&#xD;
Thornfield's sole pleasure, now that this&#xD;
great blight had fallen on his life, al his&#xD;
visits to Ruth had ceased, was to seat himself&#xD;
opposite her door on a stone bench in the&#xD;
Park, which fronted her house. Here he&#xD;
cou  see ier coming and going : driving witb&#xD;
lartley every day, aid accoipamiie(l by hi&#xD;
and her aunt, Mi's. Whining, goimg ab out&#xD;
some gayety every evening. llartlev's visits&#xD;
were constant; and every oeit who hal ex-&#xD;
pressed himself-or herself-inm uinavorahle&#xD;
terms of the aflianced husband-was pretty&#xD;
well e'xeuilded f'rom the house. One eveinmilg&#xD;
Thornfield sat at his post, regardless of a rinn&#xD;
which was coming down quietly 'imt steadily,&#xD;
and drenching him from head  to foot, when&#xD;
he saw Hartley drive up to Ihbe door, hng&#xD;
the reims to the groom, who cleared away at&#xD;
a rattling pace. I tartley was evidently  in"&#xD;
for a ong evening of it.&#xD;
Poor Ruth," imiutfered Roger between his&#xD;
teeth.&#xD;
Absorbed by his bitter reflections, Ihorn-&#xD;
fieldl failed to observe that the stone( bench&#xD;
on which lie sat, held another oceuplanit Ibe-&#xD;
sidle himself. This occupant was a young&#xD;

JOHN MORRIS'S MONEY.&#xD;
&#xD;
JOHN MORRIS' MONEY.&#xD;
&#xD;
woman with a handsome painted face, a pair&#xD;
of bold black eves, and a luxuriant, untidy&#xD;
head of hair. Her dress was composed of&#xD;
costly materials, but the rain of to-night and&#xD;
the neglect, perhaps of weeks, had rendered&#xD;
it the reverse of handsome. She made one&#xD;
or two efforts to attract the attention of the&#xD;
sad-looking young man who sat gazing fixed-&#xD;
ly on the house across the way, but finding&#xD;
they were fruitless, she moved along the&#xD;
bench noiselessly, and, without speaking, laid&#xD;
her delicate white hand lightly on his shoul-&#xD;
der.&#xD;
Roger started and looked around to find&#xD;
the bold, black eyes peering deep into his, and&#xD;
the painted, handsome lips within a finger's&#xD;
length of his own. Instinctively he shrank&#xD;
from this woman and turned his back on her.&#xD;
The rain was pouring down heavily now, and&#xD;
spite of the aversion which one glance at her&#xD;
had caused him, Thornfield could not help&#xD;
feeling compassion for a wretch whose only&#xD;
home probably was in the pitiless streets.&#xD;
His eyes wandered to the right and to the&#xD;
left, in front and back of the bench where&#xD;
they sat ; beside themselves there was not&#xD;
a human being to be seen.    Across the&#xD;
street, Ruth's shutters jealously closed, her-&#xD;
self inside with the worthless man she had&#xD;
chosen, while the pure young heart which&#xD;
loved her through all, Roger Thornfield, the&#xD;
friend of her youth, sat on a cold stone&#xD;
bench in the dripping rain, side by side with&#xD;
a painted midnight tramp !&#xD;
He hoped she would go. But that he did&#xD;
not wish to speak to her, lie would have of-&#xD;
fered her charity and told her to go. While&#xD;
he was deliberating whether ne should say so&#xD;
much to her, she spoke to him.&#xD;
"I want about half an hour's conversations&#xD;
with you. Can I have it?"&#xD;
" No," he said, " I'll give you charity if&#xD;
you want it, but go away from me."&#xD;
" I don't want your charity, as you call&#xD;
it," she answered bitterly. " I suppose you&#xD;
mean money. God knows it's little enough&#xD;
of any other charity I get."&#xD;
He did not answer. There was a pause&#xD;
for a moment-broken by the woman.&#xD;
" Why don't you go there any more ?" she&#xD;
said, pointing to the house opposite.&#xD;
"Where?" said Thornfield.-&#xD;
" Oh, you know well enough what I mean.&#xD;
To the house opposite.- I have been hanging&#xD;
about this park longer than you have, and I&#xD;
know you t.sed to go there often, and one&#xD;
(lay you came away looking very wretched,&#xD;
and you have not been there since. Has he&#xD;
driven you off?"&#xD;
Thornfield rose to go.&#xD;
"You're a fool to try to get away from&#xD;
me," continued this woman in a low tone;&#xD;
"I could tell you something now you'd give&#xD;
your eyes to know."&#xD;
"What about," asked Roger, still walking&#xD;
on while the woman followed at his side.&#xD;
&#xD;
"What about?    Why about him, to be&#xD;
sure. What do I care for anybody else? "&#xD;
" About that man, do you mean ! About&#xD;
Arthur Hartley?" said Roger, whose inter-&#xD;
est was now fully awakened.&#xD;
Arthur Hartley ! That's what he calls&#xD;
himself, is it? Yes, about Arthur-what&#xD;
was it-oh yes, Hartley ! and a very pretty&#xD;
name, too. That's his Philadelphia name."&#xD;
" Has he any other, then'? " asked Thorn-&#xD;
field with breathless anxiety.&#xD;
"Oh ho!!" said the woman with a coarse&#xD;
laugh.  " That wakes you up, does it?  I&#xD;
thought you didn't wan't to talk to nme-a&#xD;
poor wretch out all alone in a dark, rainy&#xD;
night. Where shall we go? In here?"&#xD;
They were standing before the door of a&#xD;
lady's restaurant," one of the best in Phil-&#xD;
adelphia.  Roger looked up and shrank&#xD;
back. He shuddered at beimg seen in the&#xD;
company of this painted creature with the&#xD;
dripping dress.&#xD;
" I'd rather not," he said hastily. "I'd&#xD;
rather go somewhere where we can talk pri-&#xD;
vately. If you are tired or hungry go in.&#xD;
Here is some money. I'll wait for you out.&#xD;
side."&#xD;
"I never feel either fatigue or hunger&#xD;
when I'm after my revenge. I don't want&#xD;
your money, I tell you ; I'm after my re-&#xD;
venge." She clenched her bands together as&#xD;
she spoke, and, in the stillness of the dark&#xD;
night, Roger heard the sharp grinding of her&#xD;
white teeth.&#xD;
" Where can we go?" he said, hopelessly.&#xD;
"Why don't you take me to your rooms,"&#xD;
she answered roughly, " you have got some&#xD;
rooms somewhere, haven't you? "&#xD;
Roger thought of the quiet lodgings kept&#xD;
by a pious Quakeress, a widow woman with&#xD;
half a dozen young children. No, no, he&#xD;
could not take her there.&#xD;
" I suppose you would not like to go to&#xD;
the garret where I hive," said she.&#xD;
Thornfield hesitated. This woman might&#xD;
Nbe leadinghim into a trap.  She might be&#xD;
leagued with a gang of robbers and ruffians.&#xD;
Should he go with her-to his doom, perhaps?&#xD;
Why not ?  What had he to lose? 'The little&#xD;
money he earned from month to month con-&#xD;
stituted his only earthly fortune, and as for&#xD;
his life, what was that worth to him since&#xD;
Ruth Villemain loved another ?&#xD;
" I will go with you," he said.&#xD;
They walked off silently, for their way was&#xD;
through unfrequented thoroughfares where no&#xD;
cars were running. A weary journey over&#xD;
hillocks of bricks and dibris of demolished&#xD;
houses-through back alleys, whose -effluvia&#xD;
was oppressive  and  overwhelming"- out&#xD;
beyond the town to the open country-and at&#xD;
length the woman stopped before the door of&#xD;
a wretched looking hovel.&#xD;
" Go m," said she pushing the door on its&#xD;
rusty hiinges- -&#xD;

it&#xD;
'r&#xD;
&#xD;
the great business house of C-- &amp;amp; Co.,&#xD;
groped his way up the creaking staircase&#xD;
closely followed by the painted midnight&#xD;
tramp he had met in the park, on the rainy&#xD;
night.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
THAT same rainy night, after Mr. Hartley&#xD;
had driven up to Ruth's door and flung his&#xD;
reins to the smart groom, he entered the&#xD;
large drawing-room of this fine house, and&#xD;
enquired for Miss Villemain.&#xD;
" Be down in a minute, sir," said Williams.&#xD;
"Dear ue, sir! your overcoat is quite wet!&#xD;
Ill take it down stairs to dry."&#xD;
The man, leaving, the room, met Mrs.&#xD;
Whining, to whom he gave a respectful bow.&#xD;
"My dear Hartley," said the lady advanc-&#xD;
mug to meet the handsome New Yorker, "1I1&#xD;
knew it was you! I said to Ruth: 'My dear,&#xD;
do you hear how lightly that door is shut?&#xD;
That's Hartley. Hartley never bangs. I&#xD;
never knew Hartley to thump in my life.&#xD;
Hartley is a treasure.. Outside of a bedrid-&#xD;
den party, who can be made over to paid&#xD;
nurses at'once, I don't know of any one who&#xD;
will annoy you less, as a husband, than&#xD;
Hartley. Hartley, to use some of the horrid&#xD;
slang of the (lay, Hartley is the Ace of&#xD;
Clubs.' "&#xD;
"My dear Mrs. Whining! " exclaimed&#xD;
Hartley, "how black you are making me!&#xD;
Why am I the Ace of Clubs, pray? "&#xD;
I don't mean that," replied the lady&#xD;
sinking into an arm-chair. " I've got it con-&#xD;
fused. I knew I should. I mean a' trump.'&#xD;
I never played cards but once. It bores me&#xD;
to fix my mind on stupid little pieces of paint-&#xD;
ed pasteboard. On the solitary occasion of&#xD;
which I speak, it was observed that the Ace&#xD;
of Clubs happened to be frequently the trump.&#xD;
So I got it confused. Pray overlook the&#xD;
mistake."&#xD;
" Will Ruth soon be down? " asked Hart-&#xD;
ley, who seemed restless and uneasy.&#xD;
" Yes, in a minute. - Her maid was at her&#xD;
hair when I came down. 1 would not have&#xD;
that maid if she would come to me for noth-&#xD;
ing. Such a noisy creature, and sticks the&#xD;
hair pins into one's head frightfully. My&#xD;
maid is bad enough. But they are all alike&#xD;
-they will talk. I hate talking. I never&#xD;
would go to the theatre if I could help it, ex-&#xD;
cept when they play pantomimes and ballets.&#xD;
No talking, you know. Even then, thery&#xD;
play horrid, noisy, distracting music. What a&#xD;
very unpleasant thing music is !"&#xD;
"How confoundedly long Ruth stays!"&#xD;
said Hartley, rising from his seat and pacing&#xD;
the floor abstractedly.&#xD;
"That's her maid's fault! The poor girl&#xD;
is positively the abject slave of that woman&#xD;
when- she's at her hair. If Ruth tells her to&#xD;
hurry, she sticks pins in her head. If she tells&#xD;
&#xD;
her of that, she pulls hter hair out. ' Acciden-&#xD;
tal,' did you suggest ? No such thing; it's&#xD;
malice-pure spite."&#xD;
Hartley made no reply, but kept looking&#xD;
anxiously at the door.&#xD;
" Hartley ! " continued Mrs. Whining,&#xD;
if you had the remotest idea how nervous&#xD;
you make me by gazing at the door in that&#xD;
distressed manner, I am sure y-ou would de-&#xD;
sist at once. I'm going now. Iheeanse I hear&#xD;
Ruth's rustling dress on the stairs. I hate&#xD;
silks because they rustle, which is unbear-&#xD;
able."&#xD;
" Don't let me chase you away, Aunty,"&#xD;
said Ruth, entering with a happy smile, an'd&#xD;
extending her little dimpled hand to Hartley.&#xD;
Dear, I wouldn't stay for worlds ! You&#xD;
are going to bill and coo here, and that I posi-&#xD;
tively cannot stand. All the emotions-even&#xD;
the pleasurable ones-are most distressing to&#xD;
my nerves. Joy, for instance, is such a noisy&#xD;
emotion ! I can't bear it. Grief, when very&#xD;
subdued, is much   less offensive. Please&#xD;
kiss me very lightly, Ruth. I so dislike a&#xD;
hearty good-night smack, what wretched vul-&#xD;
gar people called a ' buss.' Ta-ta, Hartley.&#xD;
Good-night. I'll see you to morrow."&#xD;
She never saw him again.&#xD;
" My darling w fc," said Iartley, as the&#xD;
door closed on Mrs. Whining.&#xD;
Not yet, Arthur," said the gil, seating&#xD;
herself on the sofa beside him. " But soon,&#xD;
very soon."&#xD;
He was silent.&#xD;
" Arthur! How pale you look to-night!&#xD;
What is the matter ? "&#xD;
Nothing, dearest," he replied, passing his&#xD;
hand over his forehead, on which drops of&#xD;
perspiration were standing, though the night&#xD;
was not a warm one.&#xD;
There is something wrong. Ai, Arthur !&#xD;
can you keep anything from me, your own&#xD;
little Ruth ? " ie put his  arm about her&#xD;
waist and, leaning over, kissed her fresh young&#xD;
lips.&#xD;
" I would tell you at once, dearest, ex-&#xD;
cept that it is a horrid business affair-"&#xD;
" Business, Arthur ! " she repeated, '' I&#xD;
thought you were not in business."&#xD;
'Well, it is not business in the usual ac-&#xD;
ceptation of the term, and vet it is business,&#xD;
too, of a certain sort. In 'act, it's ablout-&#xD;
about--"&#xD;
About money ? " she asked.&#xD;
Well, yes -about money."&#xD;
I knew it," she said, "money is always&#xD;
causing trouble."&#xD;
There was a pause for a moment, and then&#xD;
the pretty girl wound her arms tenderly&#xD;
about Hartley's neck, and, wlhispering in his&#xD;
ear, said-&#xD;
" Arthur !&#xD;
" Well, Ruth."&#xD;
"Let me furnish this money."&#xD;
"Nonsense, chiildl -- you dloni't know how&#xD;
large the sum is."&#xD;
"I'm suic I don't care how large it is I&#xD;

JOHN MORRIS'S MONEY.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ive got plenty of money. There were some&#xD;
heavy payments made me last week. Come,&#xD;
say you will take it from me."&#xD;
'If she had had. more experience of the&#xD;
world, especially the world of badness-if&#xD;
she had been less infatuated with this man,&#xD;
she would have seen at once that this was&#xD;
the very point to which he had been leading&#xD;
her, and that he now smiled triumphantly at&#xD;
her folly.&#xD;
" First let me explain the affair," he said.&#xD;
"You see, Ruth, I'm unfortunately endowed&#xD;
with a little bit of mechanism they call a&#xD;
heart-deuced tender, you know.   Perfect&#xD;
fool I've been, or I should have been-well,&#xD;
rich as-What d'ye call em-Crosus-this&#xD;
day. Still you know-I would not change my&#xD;
heart, would you? No, of course not; I&#xD;
thought you'd' say so. Well, about three&#xD;
months ago, one of my school-mates-good&#xD;
fellow as ever lived. only will get perpetually&#xD;
into scrapes-came to nie and said, ' Arthur&#xD;
my boy! I want your name on the back of&#xD;
that paper. Just for form's sake, you know.&#xD;
You'll never hear a word about it again, and it&#xD;
will help me to negotiate '-you understand,&#xD;
don't you, Ruth-how business men accommo-&#xD;
date one another? Oh, don't you? Well, I'll.&#xD;
explain it some day or another to you How-,&#xD;
ever, having full belief in his honesty, I en-&#xD;
dorsed the note, and 'pon honor, the bill falls&#xD;
due to-morrow, and I've just this minute&#xD;
heard that lie has run off to Europe, and that&#xD;
they'll come down oi me for the money-&#xD;
fifteen thousand dollars. Isn't it dreadful,&#xD;
Ruth !"&#xD;
" How can men be so dishonest." said the&#xD;
girl, drinking in his foolish story with perfect&#xD;
belief in its veracity.&#xD;
" The worst of it is that my father-never&#xD;
mentioned to you that I had a father? Why&#xD;
yes, my dear girl, I did-did'nt I? Well,&#xD;
that's funny ! Of course I've got a father.&#xD;
Where does he live? Oh, at New York-and&#xD;
New England.    He'll be mad enough to&#xD;
kill me when he hears of it, and ten to one&#xD;
wont come down with the dust at all, but&#xD;
just let me sweat for it. Oh, this is why I&#xD;
never mentioned him to you. At least I think&#xD;
it is. Did'nt want to hurt your feelings, you&#xD;
know. But lie's as mad as blazes because&#xD;
I'm marrying a Philadelphia girl; wanted&#xD;
mne to marry a foreign woman with a title.&#xD;
Stupid pride, isn't it? I always said so-es-&#xD;
pecially for Americans. All well enough for&#xD;
uropeans, who hold so much to that style of&#xD;
thing. In the meantime just think of it-&#xD;
fifteen thousand dollars!"&#xD;
"Let me draw you a draft for this money,&#xD;
Arthur," said Ruth, rising and crossing to&#xD;
her rosewood Secretaire.&#xD;
" Oh, you darling girl" said Hartley, hug'&#xD;
ging his affianced bride with great fervor, but&#xD;
kissing her rather abstractedly, for lie was&#xD;
thinking about this money and the means o~&#xD;
getting it.&#xD;
&#xD;
JOHN MORRIS'S MONEY.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Stop Ruth," he said, "I tell you what&#xD;
will be better than that. It will look rather&#xD;
funny for me, I'm afraid, to be drawing a lot&#xD;
of money on your draft. People are so&#xD;
cursed ill natured ! Just like 'em to say 'What&#xD;
the dickens is Hartley drawing her money&#xD;
for, before they are married ?' No stopping&#xD;
their beastly tongues. The way we can&#xD;
manage it is this -if you really insist on my&#xD;
taking this money." She assured him loving-&#xD;
ly that she did., "Well then, I'll come for&#xD;
you in a back to-morrow at ten, and then we&#xD;
can drive to the bank, you can draw your&#xD;
money-ah, and give it-ah-to me-and&#xD;
I'll take the eleven o'clock train, arrive in&#xD;
New York at two, up town and make my&#xD;
payment before three, and then I am all&#xD;
O. K. Excuse slang, darling. One contracts&#xD;
these horrid phrases among-ah-you know&#xD;
-business men."&#xD;
" And when will you return, dear Arthur?"&#xD;
asked Ruth.&#xD;
"Oh - return-shortly  of course-very&#xD;
shortly. The next day or same evening-yes&#xD;
to be sure, the same evening. And you know&#xD;
Ruth, soon as ever I have a streak of luck-&#xD;
no, I don't mean that, but when (lad pays up&#xD;
my-my half-yearly income, derived from-.&#xD;
oh, dear child, this must be stupid to you, and&#xD;
I hate business, too. But what I mean is&#xD;
that--the money shall be returned to you."&#xD;
She would not allow him to speak of that,&#xD;
she said, and if the truth must be confessed,&#xD;
he seemed very glad -of it. He referred to&#xD;
the subject once again during the evening.&#xD;
Think  it will excite attention, your&#xD;
drawing such a large amount, Ruth? " he&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
" No, I have no one to question me, nor&#xD;
of whom I must ask leave.  But if those&#xD;
payments had not been made last week&#xD;
I don't believe I could have got so much&#xD;
money at a moment's notice."&#xD;
Mr. Hartley devoted- at least half an&#xD;
hour to desperate love-making, which was in-&#xD;
terrupted by Williams, the man servant, who,&#xD;
after rapping lightly, looked in with rather a&#xD;
nervous expression of face quite unusual to&#xD;
the easy going valet.&#xD;
" Please Miss," he said, "here's Mr.&#xD;
Thornfield outside very excited, saying he&#xD;
must and will see you to-night, he don't care&#xD;
how late it is."&#xD;
Ruth looked at Arthur, as if to ask what&#xD;
reply she should make. Arthur replied for&#xD;
f her.&#xD;
" Tell Mr. Thornfield he can't come in."&#xD;
" Mr. Hartley says you can't come in,"&#xD;
said Williams to Thornfield, who stood in the&#xD;
hall outside.&#xD;
" Does lie ?" yelled Thornfield, pushing&#xD;
past the man, rushing into the drawing room&#xD;
t and planting himself before Hartley. " Now&#xD;
let Mr. Arthur Hartley (as he chooses to&#xD;
f call himself) say the same to me !"&#xD;

" My dear Miss Villemain," said Hartley,&#xD;
turning coolly to Ruth, " is ths-ah-your&#xD;
Quaker friend-or, ali-an Italian brigand ?"&#xD;
".Mr. Thornfield," said  Ruth  coldly,&#xD;
" will yon be good enough to explain this&#xD;
conduct? "&#xD;
" I will, Ruth," said Thornfield-" Oh my&#xD;
poor girl, how it, will make you suffer!&#xD;
Read that letter. Ruth-it will convince you&#xD;
of this man's perfidy better than I can. It&#xD;
tells its own story."&#xD;
Ruth took the letter and looked at it. " It&#xD;
is in your handwriting, Arthur," she said.&#xD;
She thought she saw his lips tremble and his&#xD;
cheek blanch slightly - nevertheless his tone&#xD;
was firm enough as he replied:&#xD;
Is it? Then read it, Ruth. -Read it-if&#xD;
it is in my handwriting." She read aloud:&#xD;
"DEAR CAROLINE:&#xD;
"6.Why will you make an idiot Qf&#xD;
yourself in this way? Can you not see that&#xD;
I am playing a deep game with this-girl, Ruth&#xD;
Villenmain. Come on, and spoil all by your&#xD;
foolish jealousy, do ! What if you have heard&#xD;
I was cooing to marry her ? How can I?&#xD;
" My idea is to worm a good big sum of&#xD;
money out of her, get clear off, and then let&#xD;
her whistle for her ' bridegroom.' Don't&#xD;
you see ?&#xD;
" I enclose you twenty-five dollars. Go&#xD;
buy yourself a pound of sweetmeats at Mail-&#xD;
lard's and when I make the haul in question&#xD;
I'll buy you a handsome diamond ring at&#xD;
Tiffanv's; so keep that cursed black Indian&#xD;
blood of yours under control, and believe&#xD;
me when I tell you that, spitfire as you are,&#xD;
you please me better than any woman I ever&#xD;
met."&#xD;
" No signature," said Ruth in a trembling&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
"By George, I'm sorry for that," said&#xD;
Hartley, taking the letter deliberately from&#xD;
her hand ; " if' my signature had been at-&#xD;
tached, I should have placed this in the hands&#xD;
of the proper authorities to-morrow ; but as&#xD;
it is; "-and he scanned it very closely, for&#xD;
Mr. Hartley said he was quite near-sighted-&#xD;
" as it is, I pronounce it only a very stupid&#xD;
forgery."&#xD;
" A forgery ! " repeated Thornfield and&#xD;
Ruth in the same breath.&#xD;
" A-forgery !" said Mr. Hartley, conclu-&#xD;
sively.&#xD;
" You lie!" shrieked a fierce voice from&#xD;
outside. There was a struggle, and a noise,&#xD;
as of a scuffle. The door was flung open,&#xD;
and the handsome, painted woman, whom&#xD;
Roger Thornfield had met in the Park, stood&#xD;
in a defiant attitude, with her dripping dress,&#xD;
and her untidy hair, in Ruth Villemain's&#xD;
drawing room.&#xD;
" Do you dare to deny me,our ee! you&#xD;
base wretch PC screamed this woman, ad-&#xD;
dressing herself to Hartley.&#xD;
&#xD;
It only required one glance at him as lie&#xD;
shrank cowering among the Cushions of the&#xD;
sofa, to see that she was what she proclaimed&#xD;
herself. His self-possession had entirely left&#xD;
him now. It was evident that this woinati's&#xD;
influence over him was great-either good or&#xD;
bad-it was great.&#xD;
George Hackley," she said, frowning&#xD;
darkly at him, " you are the meanest wretch&#xD;
that walks the earth. You're a giilher&#xD;
and a thief and a liar. I was an Imocent&#xD;
girl when you got hold of ime. See what I&#xD;
amn now. I didn't care how much you cheat-&#xD;
ed men. I helped you     at it. Bmmt you&#xD;
shan't ruin any more women if I can pre-&#xD;
vent it. You've sent one to perdition-that's&#xD;
me-and that's enough. Come, get up, and&#xD;
go with me. You'd better. Bad as I aim,&#xD;
I'm the only friend you've got."&#xD;
The man seemed to feel this, for he ober-&#xD;
ed her passively, and without casting a&#xD;
glance at either Ruth or Thornfield, he&#xD;
skulked, like a coward cur, out of the house&#xD;
of which he had been but a few moments be-&#xD;
fore virtually the master.&#xD;
" I've done you the best turn you ever&#xD;
had done you in your life," said the woman&#xD;
turning to Ruth ; " the more you hear of&#xD;
him the -more you'll thank me. But I did&#xD;
it willingly, because you're a woman. As for&#xD;
you, Mr. Thornfield, I'll never forget you.&#xD;
You've treated inc with decncv-as I've&#xD;
not been treated sine-" pointing her fin-&#xD;
ger the way in which Ilaitley had gone-&#xD;
" since I met him. I feel grateful. I wish&#xD;
you good-bye. You seem an honest, vell&#xD;
meaning young man. Keep away fromil such&#xD;
women as I aim, and you'll remain so."&#xD;
She left them.&#xD;
When Roger turned to Ruth lie found she&#xD;
had fainted. le rang the bell, placed her&#xD;
in the hands of her frightened imai, and&#xD;
their returned to his distant lodgings.&#xD;
It was three years before Roger Thorn-&#xD;
field saw Ruth again. .She and her aunit left&#xD;
for Europe the day after the affair, and RHog-&#xD;
er made up his mind she. would marry abroad.&#xD;
He applied himself valiantly to his business,&#xD;
and by dint of industry, talent and persever-&#xD;
ance, lie became head of the house in which&#xD;
lie had formerly been employed. Ile heard&#xD;
that Ruth had lost her fortune through the&#xD;
dishonesty of an agent. Le did not know&#xD;
if this was true, but one day he met her&#xD;
quite unexpectedly in the street, and asked&#xD;
her. She said yes, it was true she was re-&#xD;
duced to comparative poverty.&#xD;
About three months afterward, he asked&#xD;
her another question. I scarcely know what&#xD;
she replied to this, but if you feel interested&#xD;
in the matter you numihit go on to Philadel-&#xD;
hia and ask her.   ou must inquire for&#xD;
dIrs. Rog'er Thiornfield, though, or you will&#xD;
not be likely to find her.&#xD;

JOHN MORRIS'S MONEY-&#xD;
&#xD;
Holden had been a thirty-days man, and that&#xD;
his thirty tlavs had lasted till he entered&#xD;
Richmond with Graut's army. His uniform&#xD;
had got very rusty and shabby long before&#xD;
Gettysburg ; and at Gettysburg he received&#xD;
an ugly wound in his thigh, which fortunately&#xD;
didn't make amputation necessary, but whieh&#xD;
in healing had shrivelled up one of his legs&#xD;
antil it was some inches shorter than the&#xD;
other, making him limp painfully, and having&#xD;
at the same time a distressing effect on his&#xD;
general health. In about a month after he&#xD;
was about again he was detailed fhr picket-&#xD;
duty, andt o! a bullet from nowhere, seem-&#xD;
ingly, shattered his left arim, aind made hin&#xD;
again an inmate of a military hospital. The&#xD;
arm had to go ; and now Robert Holden, with&#xD;
only one arm, lame, and hearing withal the&#xD;
hurthien of unceasing ill-health, walked ip&#xD;
the principal street of' Marstown and silently&#xD;
bemoaned his fate.&#xD;
In some respects his fate seemed a pleas-&#xD;
ant one. He was by all odds the r'hest&#xD;
man in Marstown. His father had amassed&#xD;
something whiich, even iii these days of al-&#xD;
most Sardaiapalan.luxury, looked Very like&#xD;
a fortune. The last voyage his father had&#xD;
taken (for he was a sea-captain and had per-&#xD;
ished with his vessel, one stormy night, off&#xD;
the Bahama Islands) ; even this voyage had&#xD;
brought its pecuniary fruits to the then young&#xD;
lad, -Robmert Uolden. His mother had left&#xD;
him  a fine farm, in the adjoining county,&#xD;
which brought i a good round sum as a yearly&#xD;
rent. The ground on which the grocer' and&#xD;
d'ry-goods store stood was his; and all that&#xD;
rich land there to the left-oh, far hevond&#xD;
the fi'nce-that too was his; and last, hut&#xD;
perhaps best, the house and grounds, both in&#xD;
such capital condition, where Holden now&#xD;
made his home, were his.&#xD;
Of hate, too, a greater source of happiness&#xD;
than any lantis, or houses, or cows, ompgres-&#xD;
cery stores, seemed opening for the crippled&#xD;
hero. His nature was a very self-contained&#xD;
on'e, and   to the ,age of twenty-five, his&#xD;
love for s mother had been all-sufficient for&#xD;
him ; and then she died, and then came war,&#xD;
and now Robert Holden found himself in his&#xD;
thirtieth year with some few gray hairs shin-&#xD;
ing here and there among his soft brown&#xD;
curls (for he belonged to a family who grew&#xD;
gray very early), and until very recently had&#xD;
never thought of love and marriage. The&#xD;
man's nature was a retiring one ; there was a&#xD;
dearth of marriageable girls in the village ;&#xD;
there is not much of what is lovely in woman-&#xD;
kimd to be seen in the neighborhood of an&#xD;
army; so after all, it was scarcely to be&#xD;
wondered at that Robert Holden hadremain-l&#xD;
ed heart-whole.&#xD;
He was not heart-whole now-far from it.&#xD;
but that was something which had happened&#xD;
within the last three months. It was the&#xD;
sumaplest story in the world. He had seen thme&#xD;
pretty new school-mistress, and had fallen in&#xD;
Jove with her, and had told her of his feeling&#xD;
&#xD;
very honestly and plainly, and she hadl given&#xD;
him to understand that she loved him iiire-&#xD;
turn, and tuey' were engaged. This was all&#xD;
very grritif'yii, hut still theme was on  drop)&#xD;
of bitterness in the honey en1.&#xD;
Poor an opinion as the kind-hearted Rob&#xD;
ert had of himself it was impossible foi -ili&#xD;
to be quite unaware that lie was the best&#xD;
match " in the village- that fin6:magimI in&#xD;
her position it was the greatest Pw( ile lathck&#xD;
to (   met snch an offer ; and try as he voiubh to&#xD;
Sehieve the vows of her love which she pos-&#xD;

JOHN MORRIS'S MONEY.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
Stil&#xD;
&#xD;
out at her whenever she set them the most&#xD;
necessary task. This life was death to her&#xD;
so Minie told Robert lloien--untilhe catoe.&#xD;
Then all was different !&#xD;
Did he believe her?  God knows he wish-&#xD;
ed to do so ! But still-still--&#xD;
He was ruminating upor it as he reached&#xD;
the door of' the little store which served the&#xD;
triple office of dispensing stationery, news-&#xD;
paper literature and  sugar-plums to the&#xD;
Marstowners, and in one corner of which&#xD;
there hung a sort of mysterious and suspend-&#xD;
ed etagbre divided off intolittle pigeon-holes.&#xD;
This piece of furniture was nothing more or&#xD;
less than the Marstown Post-Office itself.&#xD;
The Post-mistress was selling three cents&#xD;
worth of molasses candy to an uninteresting&#xD;
female child, as Robert'entered and asked if&#xD;
there was a letter for him.&#xD;
6 Yes, indeed ! I guess there is a letter for&#xD;
vout, Mr. Holden," said the Post-mistress,&#xD;
dragging off a huge bit of coarse, brown pa-&#xD;
pert and laying the sticky molasses-mess in-&#xD;
side--" a letter-there's two ! There now,&#xD;
run home, sis ; tell your mother if she wants&#xD;
any lemons again I've got some now; she&#xD;
needn't go to the grocery'-store ; and two&#xD;
letters from big towns too, I tell vou, Mr.&#xD;
Holden ; and say to your pap that I'm sorry&#xD;
he bought some of those yellow enn-vellopes&#xD;
that don't stick-lots of people complained&#xD;
of them ; I'l change 'em if he's got many.&#xD;
Yes, that's all ; and Mr. Holden, on the big&#xD;
one there's three cents due.&#xD;
Robert crushed the letters in his hand as&#xD;
lie looked at the post marks and saw that&#xD;
neither was from the adjacent town where&#xD;
Minnie Davison had gone to spend a week&#xD;
with the family of one of her pupils. Acquit-&#xD;
ting his debt to the post-mistress, he sallied&#xD;
forth again, and, resuming the thread of his&#xD;
broken, unspoken thought, he walked slowly&#xD;
back to his own home. Minnie had prom-&#xD;
ised to write to him; why had she not kept&#xD;
her word ? He opened one of the letters; it&#xD;
was from a relative in Boston-a young man&#xD;
occupying a rather important position in a&#xD;
Bank. He complained of ill health. and in-&#xD;
formed Robert that he was going to run&#xD;
down to Marstown the next week, for a fort-&#xD;
night's relaxation.  The other letter was&#xD;
from New York. The writer was a gay, rich&#xD;
voug mnan, who had been very patriotic for&#xD;
a short time, and stayed in the army till the&#xD;
gold on his shoulders began to tarnish; then&#xD;
he resigned. Robert Holden wrote back to&#xD;
both to conme down to Marstown as soon as&#xD;
possible, and stay as long as business or&#xD;
other engagemen' s would allow.&#xD;
Both invitations were accepted, and on the&#xD;
following Tuesday Marstown, the unsensa-&#xD;
tional, was aroused from its usual apathy by&#xD;
the arrival of the two dashing young city&#xD;
gents. Curniously' enough they tnt iin then cam-s&#xD;
and wvithtout previous in trodlutction, comnpar&#xD;
ed notes, each discovered who the other was&#xD;
and so Robert was saved the trouble ofl&#xD;
&#xD;
,il&#xD;
&#xD;
JOHN MAllRlIS'S MONEY.&#xD;
&#xD;
bringing about an acquaintance which had&#xD;
already brought about itself. Of course they&#xD;
bot h1ld heard the story of'the school-mistress.&#xD;
Iobert Hohlen was too important a person-&#xD;
agi, ani his probable marriage was too im-&#xD;
portant a business, to remain long a secret.&#xD;
To George Wilson, the Bostonian Minnie&#xD;
Davison was a stranger; but it s- happened&#xD;
that Algernon Deene was one of the '' offers "&#xD;
which had been rejected by Minnie's father,&#xD;
in their former days of grandeur. And thus&#xD;
it came that Algernon had some fine mis-&#xD;
givings about the school-mistress, which he&#xD;
felt it his duty to communicate to lulden.&#xD;
Pray    don't mention   that  subject,&#xD;
Deene," said Robert, impatiently, when, a&#xD;
lay or two after their arrival, Algernon pro-&#xD;
nounced Minnie Davison's name.&#xD;
Did you understand me when i said that&#xD;
I knew her formerly-knew her well?"&#xD;
Yes," answered Holden ; " what then ?"&#xD;
And that I proposed to her once ; and&#xD;
she rejected me?&#xD;
"Yes ; and again I say, what then? You&#xD;
surely are not petty enough to bear spite."&#xD;
"' Spite! My dear fellow, if there is one&#xD;
atom of spite in the nature of Algy Deene,&#xD;
why you're the flust person who ever discov-&#xD;
ered-it, that's all I can say. But the answer&#xD;
to the ' what then !' of your question is this&#xD;
-are you sure you are not mistaken in the&#xD;
girl?"&#xD;
" ' Deene !"&#xD;
"Oh, come now, don't be tragic. I tell&#xD;
you I know her-know her well. She was&#xD;
a dreadful flirt when she-when the old man&#xD;
had money.&#xD;
" So she has told me,"&#xD;
"I don't mean to say there was anything&#xD;
wrong in it, mind; or anything different to&#xD;
other girls, in the same situation ; still, she&#xD;
was very fond of society.&#xD;
" So she has told me," said Holden again.&#xD;
S I don't know how she made omt after&#xD;
the old fellow smashed, but I rather think&#xD;
that sobered her a little. Of course, shie's&#xD;
a brilliant woman and a beautiful one, and&#xD;
one you could very well be proud of, but my&#xD;
great fear is (you must see that I have only&#xD;
your interest at hieaut in speaking in this&#xD;
manner, Bob) my great fear is that-that&#xD;
-by Jove, it's such a delicate manner I real-&#xD;
ly don't know how to put it."&#xD;
What Deene means is this, Robert," said&#xD;
young Wilson, putting back his meersehaum,&#xD;
and closing the bright morocco case with a-&#xD;
snap.  "That this girl, being so fond of so-&#xD;
ciety, having suffered great poverty after&#xD;
having held such a different position previous-&#xD;
ly, that it is highly probable she has made up&#xD;
her mind to marry any one on earth who&#xD;
wants her and has got money."&#xD;
"'Any one on earth!' Upon my word,&#xD;
,Wilson, you place me in an ennobling eate-&#xD;
-gory'," said Holden with a hot, red face.&#xD;
"on't, for heaven's sak-e, tlon't get an-&#xD;
gry, Bob," ehimetd in Algy Deene. " I tell&#xD;
&#xD;
21&#xD;
&#xD;
you women are all ali!ze. She is no worse, and&#xD;
very likely far better, than many of her sex.&#xD;
But it's just this, she is full of health, youth&#xD;
and beauty, while it so liappens that you are&#xD;
-are- "&#xD;
Full of infirmities," said Robert, bitterly,&#xD;
slaking his empty sleeve, and touching with&#xD;
his stick the acting leg.&#xD;
.'' It's not so much that," said Deene, " as&#xD;
it is your delicate health. Let me ask you&#xD;

Minnie Davison's name was not mentioned&#xD;
for several days. Deene, whose.motives were&#xD;

Wilson had recently had soine biitter exper-i&#xD;

very lemiently disposed toward the sex.&#xD;
"And you sie this girl has sutich partic-&#xD;

I'&#xD;
i r&#xD;
&#xD;
Deene. " Don't get excited--don't be ab-&#xD;
surd, whatever happens. Why should I mar-&#xD;
ry a woman who had just committed so das-&#xD;
tardly an act as to play false to the best fel-&#xD;
low that ever lived ? You'll thank nie some&#xD;
day for the ungrateful and disagreeable task&#xD;
I'm  cutting out for myself here. For if&#xD;
she remain true to you, you'll be happier for&#xD;
this test--and if she prove false to you, why&#xD;
then also, you'll be far happier for the test.&#xD;
That's logic, isn't it?  Will you give your&#xD;
consent?"&#xD;
" Do what you like," said Holden, help-&#xD;
lessly. " I suppose you mean it for my good."&#xD;
You must give ine a little help," said&#xD;
Algy. " I can't manage it quite by myself.&#xD;
When doyou expect her back from Boonsville,&#xD;
or Snoozewell, or Goosequill, or whatever&#xD;
the town's name is ? "&#xD;
"To-morrow."&#xD;
" Ah ! Just oblige me by sitting down at&#xD;
that desk, will you? "&#xD;
Holden obeyed like a child.&#xD;
"Now write her a few lines to the effect&#xD;
that you have lost everything in the world."&#xD;
Holden looked up into Deene's face with&#xD;
an expression of blank amazement.&#xD;
In the world," continued the undis-&#xD;
mayed Algy ; - that your health is worse than&#xD;
ever, and that her life, if she joins it with yours.&#xD;
is likely to be one of constant privation and&#xD;
of the greatest seclusion. Tell her that,&#xD;
much as you love her, you feel it your duty&#xD;
to release her from her engagement unless she&#xD;
is fully prepared to encounter the dull and un-&#xD;
interesting life which is the only one possi-&#xD;
ble for the woman who shall be your wife."&#xD;
" This farce is as degrading to me as it&#xD;
is insulting to her," ejaculated holden, writ-&#xD;
ing as lie was bid, nevertheless, carried&#xD;
along by the resistless current of Algy's&#xD;
reasoning.&#xD;
" Now my dear ft low," continued the&#xD;
latter, seemingly unconscious of any inter-&#xD;
ruption, " just oblige me by going away&#xD;
from Marstown. You and Wilson can go&#xD;
hunting, or fishing, or to the-excuse me,I&#xD;
but anywhere just to leave me the field to&#xD;
myself, you know.   Get off to-day, will&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
Holden arose and left the room without a&#xD;
word. Wilson lingered.&#xD;
" I'm afraid this is going to be a serious&#xD;
business," he said to Deene.&#xD;
" 'Serious!!' nonsense! I am going to&#xD;
write a story about it-call it Minnie's Or-&#xD;
deal or Miss Davison's Test-or something&#xD;
of that sort."&#xD;
" I wish I could feel as easy. as you seem&#xD;
to do. It resolves itself into this, Deene-&#xD;
if the girl deserts him, it will break his&#xD;
heart, and if she hangs on, we shall have&#xD;
made a couple of donkeys of ourselves, that's&#xD;
all."    .&#xD;
The next day, when the sun was begin-&#xD;
ning to get low Algy D~eene in most irre-&#xD;
proachuable tenue, strolled down the main&#xD;
&#xD;
II&#xD;
&#xD;
JOHN MORR&#xD;
&#xD;
street of Marstown, turned off into a shady&#xD;
lane, and rapping at the door of a poor-&#xD;
looking farm house, asked for Miss Davison.&#xD;
Minnie, hearing a man's voice, flew quickly&#xD;
down stairs, expecting to see Robert Holden,&#xD;
The bright flush of happy expectation faded&#xD;
froi her face, and gave way to an expres-&#xD;
sion of bewildered astonishment at view of&#xD;
the elegant. stranger.&#xD;
"Have four years made such a fearful&#xD;
wreck of him that Algernon Deene is no&#xD;
longer recognizable, Miss Davison ? "&#xD;
"Mr. Deene ! How good of you to come&#xD;
to see me I I really did not know you at&#xD;
first. I was not expecting you, you know,&#xD;
and indeed you are somewhat changed."&#xD;
The truth was, that Algy Deene was one of&#xD;
those men who grow handsomer and hand-&#xD;
somer up to the age of forty. Minnie looked&#xD;
in amazement at the bright, rosy face which,&#xD;
without losing any of its youth in the last&#xD;
four years, had gained greatly in manly ex-&#xD;
prion.&#xD;
"Time is a sad dog, Miss Davison," said&#xD;
Deene, seating himself on a cane-seated&#xD;
chair, which was so hard it absolutely re-&#xD;
quired all Algy's good breeding to suppress&#xD;
an ejaculatory " oh !" on coming in contact&#xD;
with it.&#xD;
" Time is not a ' dog' at all, Mr. Deene,"&#xD;
said Minnie, laughing. " He is a fine old man&#xD;
with a long white heard, and a scythe in his&#xD;
hand-at least so the picture-books say."&#xD;
" You are still the same in everything, I&#xD;
see ; robe, complexion,-- all!"&#xD;
" No, I am not," returned Minnie. " As&#xD;
to ' robe,' I think you remember that I used to&#xD;
be clad in purple and fine linen; now my&#xD;
linen is not fine, and my best purple calico&#xD;
fades dreadfully in the wash-tub. * Com-&#xD;
plexion' may be better. I think it ought to&#xD;
be.  The essence of six balls'a week is&#xD;
a very pgor cosmetic, Mr. Deene;     it&#xD;
can't compare to country air and country&#xD;
hours as the true bloom of youth-of nature."&#xD;
" Then you never sigh for the city, Miss&#xD;
Minnie? " asked Algy.&#xD;
" Oh, yes I do-that is to say, I did.&#xD;
At one time, and indeed until very recently,&#xD;
it seemed quite impossible for me to ever&#xD;
getused to this most stupid of little villages.&#xD;
But we have talked quite enough about me;&#xD;
tell me about yourself. What on earth&#xD;
brings you to Marstown? "&#xD;
" i came on a visit to my old friend, Bob&#xD;
Holden," answered Deene.&#xD;
"'Your old friend !' Is Mr. Holden. a&#xD;
friend of yours? How glad I am to hear it;"&#xD;
said Minnie.&#xD;
" Yes, we are old friends, and I promised&#xD;
myself a delightful time with him, and should&#xD;
have had it, but for this dreadful stroke of&#xD;
ill-fortune which has knocked poor Bob com-&#xD;
pletely off his legs."&#xD;
1j1" l-fortutie," exclaimed Minnie Davison&#xD;
springing up. " Ill-fortune to Robert Hol--&#xD;
den ! What is it ? Oh pray tell me !"&#xD;
&#xD;
" Why, haven't you heard yet?  Oh to be&#xD;
sure not. Hoh htas taken such care to keep it&#xD;
close. Why the fact is, Miss Minnie, Bob&#xD;
has lost every dollar he had in the world !"&#xD;
As Algy Deene told this cool falsehood,&#xD;
the expression of his distingud face was as&#xD;
innocent as that of any child. And yet his&#xD;
fashionable code of honor would have been a&#xD;
blow for the man who dared call him a liar !&#xD;
A somewhat singular inconsistency-quite in&#xD;
vogue in Algv's set.&#xD;
Lost his fortune !-- Robert Holden&#xD;
poor !" echoed Minnie Davison.&#xD;
"Poor! Poor's not the word for it. He's&#xD;
just next door to a beggar," continued the&#xD;
skillful Algy.&#xD;
Minnie Davison burst into tears.&#xD;
"I'm so-so sorry for him," she sobbed&#xD;
at length.&#xD;
And so am I," said Algy in a sympathiz-&#xD;
ing tone; " very sorry, and if you wont take&#xD;
amiss the bluntness of an old friend, I will&#xD;
say to you that the only cause for congratu-&#xD;
lation i see in the whole affair is-well, I&#xD;
may as well out with it at once-that you&#xD;
are not married."&#xD;
" He told you of our engagement, then,"&#xD;
said Minnie.&#xD;
"Yes, and I think he's very glad this hap-&#xD;
pened before matrimonyy"&#xD;
"l)id he say so? " asked Minnie.&#xD;
N--no-tnot exactly that. But still I&#xD;
know he felt what a blow it would be to vou.&#xD;
You have suffered such great poverty, Miss&#xD;
Davison. You don't mind my brusqueness,&#xD;
do you?" ,&#xD;
" I have suffered dreadfully from poverty ;&#xD;
I ant suffering now," sighed Minnie. " But&#xD;
don't talk of ne-what will Robert do ?"&#xD;
"Oh, he can get a clerkship, I suppose-&#xD;
or be somebody's secretary, no doubt."&#xD;
"tRobert Holden in a clerkship ! Robert&#xD;
Holden somebody's secretary ! "&#xD;
"XWhy not ?  Better meni-I mean as good&#xD;
men have had to do it, and scores of them&#xD;
too. before his time. But these delicate&#xD;
hands of yours were never meant for any&#xD;
household drudgery.  Minnie, you were not&#xD;
born to be the wifb' of a poort man."&#xD;
" Dear Mr. Deene, you are very good,"&#xD;
said Minnie rising. " You will pardon my&#xD;
asking you to leave mue now, will you not? "&#xD;
"tOh certainly, Miss Minnie," said Algy,&#xD;
in reality very glad to get away ; " will you&#xD;
permit me to come again? "&#xD;
"Very gladly."&#xD;
" When ? "&#xD;
" To-morrow."&#xD;
 " Bob was right," soliloquized Algy as he&#xD;
turned mnto the mai street.  " I am an un-&#xD;
principled ruffian.  How I lied to her! And&#xD;
how she swallowed ever'vthing! Never once&#xD;
asked how it happened,-but took every word&#xD;
I said for gospel truth. Well, women are&#xD;
green ones, there's ito mistake about that."&#xD;
Algy was more struck with Mininie's beauntv&#xD;
the second day than he had been the first';&#xD;
&#xD;
IS'S MOSEY.                             23&#xD;
for to his taste the pallor which this great blow&#xD;
had spread over her fice was far more beau-&#xD;
tiful than the ruddy glow of health which&#xD;
had bloomed there the day before. I icr long&#xD;
brown lashes were wet with tears, and, as&#xD;
Algy entered the wrtel~e little parlor of the&#xD;
farmo-house, he fotind hot h her ittittde and&#xD;
speech indicating the greatest dejection.&#xD;
" I have more news for you to-day ; " said&#xD;
Alg seating himself heidihe her.&#xD;
Yes ?" said she, eagerly, " What is it?"&#xD;
A letter from Robert." le held it up,&#xD;
and she snatched it quickly. She read it&#xD;
aloud. . It ran thus-&#xD;
Mr DEAR MINNIE :-It is with the ut-&#xD;
most grief I announce to you the complete&#xD;
loss of my fortune. I need not tell you that&#xD;
I feel it my duty to at once release you from&#xD;
your engagement of marriage iiatde to mne&#xD;
under such very different circumstances. It&#xD;
is-the highest proof of love I can give you&#xD;
thus to relinquish what is far dearer to me&#xD;
than fortune or friends, or all the world be-&#xD;
side. But I must give you this proof, and I&#xD;
feel doubly constrained to do so by the knowl-&#xD;
edge that my health was never worse than at&#xD;
present; this, coupled with my wretched pe-&#xD;
cuniary position, will entail upon the woman&#xD;
who consents to be my wife the greatest self-&#xD;
abnegation in all that relates to society and&#xD;
the varied charms of a city life; for, without&#xD;
doubt, 1 shall be tied to this miserable vil-&#xD;
lage for the remainder of my (lays.&#xD;
Minnie, I shall take it very kidly if you&#xD;
will write me a word on this subject. I know&#xD;
your answer in advance. Despair has told it&#xD;
tme. But nothing can sting me so nmuch com-&#xD;
ing from you-nothng so much as silence.&#xD;
Your loving,      R. II.&#xD;
"Bravo, Bob!" was Algy's mental criti-&#xD;
cism on this piece of epistolary literature.&#xD;
When he looked up he found Minnie lean-&#xD;
ing back, with closed eves, in her chair, look-&#xD;
ing so ghastly white that Deene thought she&#xD;
must have fainted. Ile seized her hands and&#xD;
began chafing them violently.&#xD;
" Don't be alarmed," she said ; "' it is&#xD;
nothing. It will soon be over."&#xD;
There is no more in that letter than I&#xD;
told you yesterday."&#xD;
" No ; but seeing it in his hand-writing,&#xD;
and poor Robert's way of putting it touched&#xD;
me a little, you know. Where can I send&#xD;
the answer ? "&#xD;
" You needn't trouble yourself about the&#xD;
answer for a week. Bob is off, and writes&#xD;
tme he will be back then, when lie hopes I&#xD;
shall be able to hand hiv your reply."&#xD;
" I shall have it ready; " said Miss Davi-&#xD;
son, shaking her head sadly.&#xD;
"Minnie, how it grieves en to see you so&#xD;
distressed !&#xD;
Then there was a long pause and at length&#xD;
lDeene said in a low voice,&#xD;
"Do you know Minnie, you were vei'y&#xD;
cruel to mue once? "&#xD;

" Have you not forgotten that yet?"&#xD;
asked Minnie.&#xD;
'No indeed-not I-and never shall until&#xD;
you cause me to do so by some very great&#xD;
act of kindness. You know I loved you&#xD;
desperately, do you not?"&#xD;
"I suppose you thought you did, or you&#xD;
never would have proposed to me."&#xD;
" I loved you very, very devotedly, and&#xD;
your rejection of ime nearly broke ny heart;&#xD;
and Minnie-why should I conceal the truth ?&#xD;
I love you now more, much more than ever."&#xD;
" Mr. Deene! " exclaimed Miss Davison,&#xD;
"is this an insult ?"&#xD;
" Is it an insult to ask you to become my&#xD;
wife "&#xD;
She looked at him with astonishment de-&#xD;
picted in every feature. le continued,&#xD;
without waiting for a reply :&#xD;
" You are now off with this unfortunate af-&#xD;
fair of poor Bob. He releases you himself;&#xD;
and quite the correct thing in him, under the&#xD;
circumstances. And indeed, dear Minnie,&#xD;
it would not have been a very suitable match&#xD;
for you at the best; 'pon my word, it wouldn't.&#xD;
His ill health, his fondness for this stupid vil-&#xD;
lage where they don't even have the decency&#xD;
to manufcture anything even of so prosaic&#xD;
a character as shoes -like Lynn, you know,&#xD;
for instance-which are useful in the main,&#xD;
though unpleasant to the olfactories when&#xD;
new. On the other hand, myself, gay like&#xD;
yourself, fomd of society, in splendid health,&#xD;
with plenty of money, and loving you very&#xD;
earlyl, I repeat Minnie that I offer you my&#xD;
hand and-you know    what I mean-my&#xD;
heart."&#xD;
. " 1 am very much astonished at this," said&#xD;
Minnie Davison.&#xD;
I don't want to hurry you,'pon my word&#xD;
I don't. Take time before you answer. I'll&#xD;
give you a week, if you like. Only promise&#xD;
me- you'll think about it."&#xD;
. I promise," said Minnie.&#xD;
It was very well for Miss Davison that&#xD;
there happened to be vacation at her school&#xD;
that week, otherwise Mr. Deene's attendance&#xD;
would have interfered sadly with her duties;&#xD;
for he was with her almost constantly, every&#xD;
day fromnoon till long past sunset. The&#xD;
week passed quickly to both, and now the&#xD;
day had arrived for Robert Hiolden's return.&#xD;
" Have you written Bob's answer?" said&#xD;
Algy that evening, holding her hand, as they&#xD;
stood leave-taking at her gate.&#xD;
" Yes, here it is," said Minnie, drawing&#xD;
the letter from her pocket, and placing it in&#xD;
his hand.&#xD;
" You won't say positively whether you&#xD;
will have me or not, Minnie."&#xD;
" You really have given me such a short&#xD;
time for reflection. What's a week after all?&#xD;
But I tell you what," she added, "you&#xD;
will know very well when Robert reads&#xD;
out that letter' how I feel toward you,&#xD;
and what your chances are for the future."&#xD;
&#xD;
JOHN MORRIS'S MONEY.&#xD;
&#xD;
"'Dear, beautiful girl ! " exclaimed Algy,&#xD;
pressing her hand violently. '' Ah, Minnie !f&#xD;
won't you give me a kiss before I go? "&#xD;
" No," she said with pretty archness of&#xD;
tone; " I don't think that would be right&#xD;
just yet."&#xD;
" There's no objection.to my kissing your&#xD;
hand, is there ? "&#xD;
There was no objection to his kissing her&#xD;
hand, and so he kissed it.&#xD;
Holden and Wilson had arrived an hour&#xD;
before Algy returned to the house. Holden&#xD;
did not trouble himself to make any conpli -&#xD;
mentary inquiries in'regard to health or&#xD;
weather, but blurted out instantly:&#xD;
"Well, what's the news?"&#xD;
"My dear fellow, you are a goner."&#xD;
"For heaven's sake, drop your senseless&#xD;
jargon and tell me plainly-is the girl false&#xD;
to me ?"&#xD;
"Read for yourself, my boy," returned&#xD;
Algy. " And read out loud; mind,. that&#xD;
was one of the conditions."&#xD;
Robert seized the note roughly, tore open&#xD;
the envelope and read:&#xD;
"MY DEAR ROBERT:&#xD;
" When I was more aceustoned to soci-&#xD;
ety. and knew exactly when men were saying&#xD;
what they did not mean, and when they meant&#xD;
what they did not say, I should perhaps have&#xD;
been better able to comprehend the exact&#xD;
bearing of your letter. But now that I have&#xD;
become to a certain degree unsophisticated&#xD;
and weak, it is difficult for me to understand&#xD;
whether you really wish to release- min from&#xD;
my engagement of marriage to vou or&#xD;
whether you desire a release from me. This&#xD;
makes your letter a most delicate one for me&#xD;
to answer; for I fear, reply as I will, I must&#xD;
appear to you either very indelicate or very&#xD;
heartless. Heartless I never have been--nor&#xD;
indelicate either, I trust; and now my only&#xD;
course is to be simply truthful, at whatever&#xD;
cost.&#xD;
" Robert, I thought you knew from the first&#xD;
day I told you I loved you that I loved you&#xD;
to the exclusion, of every human being at&#xD;
that time, and meant to continue to do so for&#xD;
all time. _What imports it to mie that you&#xD;
are poor! I love Robert Holden--not the&#xD;
farm that Peggs rents, or the grocery shop,&#xD;
with Mrs. Flynn in arrears. If your health&#xD;
is bad, so iuch the more reason for me&#xD;
to be near to render you those little services&#xD;
which you require. Don't think mu immod-&#xD;
est when I say that your dear image is in niy&#xD;
mind from morning till night ; and in my&#xD;
dreams, from night till morning again. I&#xD;
love you deeply, truly ; better th:m any man&#xD;
I ever saw; better than any I ever shall see.&#xD;
I would rather be your wife if you were a&#xD;
common laborer in the fields than the wife of&#xD;
Algernon Deene (who has had the ineffable&#xD;

out; for surely never a breath of air pene-&#xD;
trated those heavy, yellow silk carriage cur-&#xD;
tains ; and as for view-why of course that&#xD;
must have been quite shut out, unless she&#xD;
permitted herself to enjoy it when she got&#xD;
out of town, on the Bowery.&#xD;
The house which the Countess Carry had&#xD;
taken stood directly opposite to ours, and,&#xD;
from the day she entered it till the day she&#xD;
left, I never saw any of-the shutters open.&#xD;
People said she kept her lamps and candles&#xD;
burning all day long; and that there was&#xD;
truth in this, I myself know. I will tell&#xD;
bow, presently. She lived quite alone with&#xD;
a solitary attendant in the shape of a shriv-&#xD;
elled-up old man, a foreigner, who drove her&#xD;
coach, and groomed her horses, and cooked&#xD;
her dinners, and did her chamber-work, the&#xD;
neighbors said, after the fashion of foreign&#xD;
men-servants. The Countess herself was a&#xD;
foreig wr. Oh, yes, to be sure; we have no&#xD;
titles-   ou know that; and had not then,&#xD;
any more than now.&#xD;
It appears that we were even in the dark&#xD;
as to her true name. Lawyer Watkins, who&#xD;
lived next door to us, said it was the Count-&#xD;
ess Quarrie, or the  Countess Corrie, or&#xD;
something like that. But we always called her&#xD;
the Countess Carry, from the day she came&#xD;
amongst us till the day she left. You can&#xD;
easily imagine that the curiosity which such&#xD;
a woman awakened, coming in the midst of&#xD;
quiet people like ourselves, was intense.&#xD;
Not that she was otherwise than quiet;&#xD;
she was as quiet as the grave itself. Except&#xD;
for the noise of the rumbling coach which&#xD;
rattled down the street twice a day-once to&#xD;
go and once to return-never a sign of life,&#xD;
never a show of being, issued from the&#xD;
Countess Carry.&#xD;
But it was the very mystery which envel-&#xD;
oped her-the deathlike silence as of the&#xD;
grave, which seemed to throw a pall over the&#xD;
existence of a human being full of life and&#xD;
health probably, that awakened the wonder&#xD;
of the neighbors, and gave rise to a thou-&#xD;
sand wild-theories concerning the strange&#xD;
self-immuring of this foreign lady.&#xD;
A story gained ground that she was in-&#xD;
sane, and that the old man-servant was her&#xD;
guardian or keeper. There was not any&#xD;
lbundation for this, however, and it seemed&#xD;
scarcely probable that a person who had&#xD;
free ingress and egress to  her carriage&#xD;
every day (for the man-servant always bow-&#xD;
ed her out and bowed her in at a respectful&#xD;
distance) should not call or cry out to pass-&#xD;
ers-by if it were true that she was under re-&#xD;
straint of any kind. Another was to the ef.&#xD;
feet that she was a beautiful young creature&#xD;
who had been abominably treated by a&#xD;
wretch of a husband-another was that she&#xD;
was a beautiful young wretch who had treat-&#xD;
ed a good husband abominably, and been&#xD;
deserted both by him and the man she de-&#xD;
ceived him for ; another was something else,&#xD;
and another something else again-and at&#xD;
&#xD;
last speculation about her ceased, for noth-&#xD;
ing could be found out. Whether the heavily-&#xD;
veiled, gracefully-draped figure which glided&#xD;
daily into, -the c arriage was young or old,&#xD;
beautiful or hideous, rich or poor-or, for&#xD;
the matter of that, male or female-who&#xD;
could tell?&#xD;
Some of the more determined neighbors&#xD;
had. called upon her in the early days, but&#xD;
the old man-servant who took their names at&#xD;
the door said that Madame the Countess&#xD;
felt very grateful for their courtesy, but beg-&#xD;
ged to be excused from receiving their visits&#xD;
or making any in return.. And so. little by&#xD;
little, the mystery, still unsolved, of the&#xD;
Countess Carry died by degrees. That is to&#xD;
say, lively curiosity died because the novel-&#xD;
ty of the affair had worn off; but the embers&#xD;
wonderment, unquenched, were only smould-&#xD;
ering, and might easily be revived with a&#xD;
breath.&#xD;
You know, my children, how very fond I&#xD;
am of birds. Everything relating to these&#xD;
beautiful feathered tribes-the lively denizens&#xD;
of mid air-has the greatest interest for me.&#xD;
It is not to be wondered at, therefore, if my&#xD;
special curiosity was awakened on reading&#xD;
the following advertisement in " Hoxr's NEW&#xD;
YORK JOURNAL " (and a very nice paper it&#xD;
was, my dears, though of course it is a thing&#xD;
of the past now).&#xD;
The advertisement ran thus:&#xD;
" WANTED. Any number of canary birds&#xD;
alive or dead; highest prices will be paid.&#xD;
Address C. C. at the Post Office of New&#xD;
York, America."&#xD;
" There's a chance for you to make some&#xD;
money. Maria," said my mother to me, on&#xD;
reading it.&#xD;
" Indeed ! " replied I, tossing my head.&#xD;
" It's very probable I should think of selling&#xD;
my canary birds that William Allston brought&#xD;
me from-from-China."&#xD;
I was an ignorant little puss, dears, as&#xD;
most girls of my age were then. But I knew&#xD;
that your grandfather, handsome Will All-&#xD;
ston had brought me six beautiful canaries&#xD;
from some foreign country where he had been&#xD;
with his ship-THE REBEL COLOST-an 1&#xD;
I knew that I prized them very highly, both&#xD;
for the sake of the birds, which were indeed&#xD;
rare at that time, as well as for the sake of&#xD;
the sailor lad to whom I was engaged. I&#xD;
think about a week had elapsed after the ad-&#xD;
vertisement ceased appearing (for it appear-&#xD;
ed many times) when I was busily occupied&#xD;
cleaning my bird cages and giving the mock-&#xD;
ing-birds a new kind of seed which had just&#xD;
come out, and trying to keep the English&#xD;
larks alive by another treatment, and survey-&#xD;
ing my Robin Redbreast admiringly, and&#xD;
perkimg out my lips with little morsels of pared&#xD;
.apple on thmemi to my darlings of all, the ca-&#xD;
naries. when chancing to turn imy eyes to-&#xD;
wards the house opposite I saw a female&#xD;
figure standmig at the window, minutely&#xD;
&#xD;
watching my actions with a telescope, or a&#xD;
large spyglass, or something like that ! I&#xD;
knew it was the Countess Carry ; but she had&#xD;
got to be rather an old story now. It was&#xD;
a nuisance, wondering who she was. and what&#xD;
she looked like, and never being able to find&#xD;
out. So I finished my birds toilette, pushed&#xD;
the aviary into the sun, and left the room.&#xD;
I called it my aviary, (lears. I suppose it&#xD;
was very pretentious in me to do so, for it&#xD;
was onlh- a great cage, about as long as that&#xD;
jpano, dividedd off into compartments for the&#xD;
different birds. That was my aviary. I had&#xD;
scarcely got down into the breakfast parlor,&#xD;
where I generally sat in the morning and&#xD;
worked at useless and ugly emhroiderv,&#xD;
such as was in style then, when Sdsan. our&#xD;
little English maid, rushed in, and told me&#xD;
that " Please Miss, that strange lady-the&#xD;
Countess Carry--is in the drawing-room, and&#xD;
asking to see you !&#xD;
Here   was 'astounding  conduct !  This&#xD;
extrao rdinary creature, who had refused the&#xD;
visits of the first people of the neighbor-&#xD;
hood-heads of families and their stuck-up&#xD;
wives-coming of her own accord to call on&#xD;
little Maria Wentworth ! I really felt quite&#xD;
nervous, and gave my white neckerchief a&#xD;
new fold, and my hair an elalhua«i re-ar-&#xD;
rangement, before I mustered up courage&#xD;
enough to go in and meet her.&#xD;
She rose as I entered, and, throwing back&#xD;
her heavy veil which, though she sat alone&#xD;
and in a darkened room, still covered her&#xD;
face, advanced toward me. She held out&#xD;
both hands and, drawing me on to the sofa&#xD;
beside her, kissed me first on one cheek, then&#xD;
on the other, before she spoke a word. Then&#xD;
I had time to scan her features. She was&#xD;
old ; oh, yes, past fifty, I should think ! IHer&#xD;
hair was gray, but her eyes, though evidently&#xD;
wear with mental cares and physical suffer-&#xD;
ing, were bright, soft, and beautiful ; her fea-&#xD;
tures were regular to perfection ; and though&#xD;
I was a little, inexperienced girl, with scar'e-&#xD;
ly any knowledge even of the beauty of my&#xD;
own sex, I could not help seeing how marvel-&#xD;
ously lovely this woman must have been in&#xD;
her prime.&#xD;
" You are astonished to see me," she said&#xD;
-after a pause, speaking in such defective&#xD;
English that I could scarcely understand her.&#xD;
Of' course I answered that I was very glad&#xD;
to see her.&#xD;
" You are a sweet enfant," she said,&#xD;
" what you call one little darling !"  Then&#xD;
she kissed me again.&#xD;
I did not know what to reply to this. By-&#xD;
and-by she spoke again.&#xD;
"You are fond of birds? "&#xD;
Oh, very," I answered, aroused by the&#xD;
introduction  of my favorite topic. "Are&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
" Some birds I like." she replied.  Some&#xD;
I hate," hissing out the word iin an extraoir-&#xD;
dinarily vehement manner. " Indeed, I&#xD;
&#xD;
]hate them all except one kind, and those I&#xD;
love to distraction."&#xD;
What kind is that ? " I asked wonderi(ing-&#xD;
lv.&#xD;
She looked about the room as if to assure&#xD;
herself that no one but myself was listening,&#xD;
and then leaning over towards me, she whis-&#xD;
pere'd mysteriously-      -&#xD;
Canaries."&#xD;
Those are my favorites too," I replied.&#xD;
"c I anm never so happy as when I n 1 caring&#xD;
for them, and ministering to their lit tle om0-&#xD;
forts, and keeping them from sickness-for&#xD;
birds do get sick, von know."&#xD;
Yes, but I don't care for that. I don't&#xD;
care if they die.  I like them just as well&#xD;
dead as alive."&#xD;
"What !'" said I, horrified.  " You like&#xD;
them as well dead as alive! "&#xD;
Better," answered she in a ehm.klinu&#xD;
tone  " it saves so much trouble."&#xD;
" I don't mind the trouble," I replied, in-&#xD;
dignantly.  " I would clean their cages, and&#xD;
put fresh water into their baths a dozen&#xD;
times a (day, if it were necessary."&#xD;
Yes," said the Countess Carry, " that's&#xD;
all very fine.  But when they die naturally&#xD;
it saves one the t rouible of killing them.I&#xD;
don't like to kill them. It pains one just as&#xD;
much to (10 it as if it were a homnuant being&#xD;
one were killing.   Still," she continued,&#xD;
with a sigh, " it has to be (lone."&#xD;
I thought now of the report which hbad been&#xD;
circulated to the effect that she was insane,&#xD;
and I fully believed it. I was beginning to&#xD;
be terribly frightened of her. Suppose she&#xD;
were to imagine I was a canary bird, and that&#xD;
killing " me '' had to be done !"&#xD;
The bell-pull was at an immense distance&#xD;
across the room, but the Countess ('arr was&#xD;
leaning back on the sofa, with her eves eloseil,&#xD;
the long lids sweeping the haded (-heek, antd&#xD;
the soft ripples of her silvery hair shading her&#xD;
wrinkled fhrehead. how lovely she looked&#xD;
thus ! Spite of time and age, and suffering&#xD;
and infirmity, she was emphatically the most&#xD;
beautiful woman I had ever seen.&#xD;
She sprang froii her recumnbent position&#xD;
so suddenly that it gave me a shock which&#xD;
sent my poor little heart quite into my mouth.&#xD;
She started on a new "' tack " this timne.&#xD;
" I)o vou like dress ? What we call, vou&#xD;

" Yes." I answered hesitatingly, " I sut)-&#xD;

" Young girl ! Faugh ! what are voung&#xD;

No, no, no, no ! It is we-ah-les granles&#xD;

very beautiful, so delicate to the complexion&#xD;
-ah how belle I shall be !"&#xD;
You are that now, Madame," I said,&#xD;
with truthful admiration of her beauty.&#xD;
" You think so? "she exclaimed, evidently&#xD;
pleased. " But wait till you see me-will it&#xD;
ever be finished? or shall I die first ? Ah, mon&#xD;
Dieu ! "&#xD;
I had not a word to say, for what with her&#xD;
rambling discourse and her dreadful French-&#xD;
English, I could scarcely understand what&#xD;
she was talking about.&#xD;
" Let me see your birds," said she, with&#xD;
sudden animation.&#xD;
I did not want to take her where thev'&#xD;
were. I had a sort of inward warning that&#xD;
I m-st beware of this woman; but I was&#xD;
afraid of' her; positively afraid to disobey&#xD;
her, and I really believe if she had asked me&#xD;
for the carving-knife, so that she might cut&#xD;
mv throat neatly, I should have rushed off&#xD;
with great alacrity and brought it to her.&#xD;
"Where are they ?" she asked.&#xD;
"cUp stairs."&#xD;
I hate stairs," she murmured.  " I hate&#xD;
stairs and people, and creatures of all sorts,&#xD;
except-canaries."&#xD;
" Perhaps you had better not go up," I&#xD;
suggested, hoping she would decline on ac-&#xD;
count of the stairs.&#xD;
" No, no," she answered, " No, I will go&#xD;
where they are. I wonder if there are any&#xD;
canary birds in heaven ! I suppose so. Alh&#xD;
mc ! " with a deep sigh, " it must be a beau-&#xD;
tiful place if there are. I hope 1 shall go&#xD;
there. I think I shall. I have never done&#xD;
anything very wicked. It is not very wicked&#xD;
to kill poor little canaries-still-" (sighing&#xD;
again,) " It is painful,"&#xD;
I determined that this flighty Countess&#xD;
Carry should not get very near my canaries.&#xD;
Whether or not it was wicked to kill them was&#xD;
an open question. My own opinion was that&#xD;
it was frightfully wicked to do so. However,&#xD;
she should have no opportunity, so far as&#xD;
mine were concerned, to commit this wicked&#xD;
or innocent act.&#xD;
I opened the door of the bird-room, as&#xD;
we called it, and saw that my little canaries&#xD;
were all there, all right in the cage. I pre-&#xD;
(eded the Countess, and intended to-keep in&#xD;
front of her the whole time she was in the&#xD;
room, but, bless you! before ever she crossed&#xD;
the threshold, and as soon as she caught sight&#xD;
of the cage, she uttered a piercing shriek&#xD;
and fell down on the floor in a (lead swoon !&#xD;
I tried to raise her, but could not. I call-&#xD;
ed for help, but no one cane. That stupid&#xD;
Susan had gone out, and so had all the family,&#xD;
leaving me alone in the house. I chafed the&#xD;
Countess' cmld hands trying to revive her,&#xD;
but there she lay, prone like a dead thing, in&#xD;
the passage-way before the door of the bird-&#xD;
room. Suddenly a frightful thought crossed&#xD;
my brain. Was shte dead :  Q'uck as light--&#xD;
nling I sprang over her priostrate form.i and in&#xD;
a minute after I was pounding away at the&#xD;
&#xD;
it&#xD;
1 :&#xD;
&#xD;
house opposite, the door of which was open-&#xD;
ed by the foreign man-servant.&#xD;
" Come," said I, seizing his withered arm.&#xD;
Come across the street to our house. Your&#xD;
tmistress-t'm afraid she's dead !"&#xD;
Grand Dieu!"lie muttered, raising his&#xD;
bony hands and shaking theta abovc his&#xD;
head-, " is it possible ! " a&#xD;
By this time a crowd had assembled, and,&#xD;
as I returned with the old man, our house be-&#xD;
gan to fill with gaping creatures, wandering&#xD;
about the rooms after they had fully surveyed&#xD;
the prostrate form of the wretched woman,&#xD;
who lay exactly where I had left her, having&#xD;
apparently never stirred. The old servant&#xD;
lifted her tenderly in his arms, carried her&#xD;
across the street, banging the door in the&#xD;
faces of a dozen inquiring people ; and little&#xD;
by little the excitement faded out and quiet&#xD;
was restored. Mamma returned to-the house&#xD;
and put me to bed with a nervous headache,&#xD;
and - there I stayed till the next morning.&#xD;
The first thing I thought of on waking was&#xD;
my birds; and so, loading myself with seed&#xD;
and apples and fish-bone, which we kept in&#xD;
the pantry, I threw on my wrapper and went&#xD;
to the bir'd-room.&#xD;
Oh my darling children ! It makes inc cry&#xD;
now to think of it Alt my beautiful cana-&#xD;
ries were gone!&#xD;
I knew that woman hadtaken them., I&#xD;
could have sworn to it. Evary bit of passion&#xD;
in my nature was aroused, and I felt I could&#xD;
almost kill this hideous female fiend who&#xD;
had first stolen my beautiful pets and then,&#xD;
no doubt, in her mad folly, killed them. I&#xD;
cry now, but I couldn't cry then, for all the&#xD;
devil in me was awakened. I had lost all&#xD;
fear of her, and her insanity. I walked&#xD;
across the street, and pounded lustily at the&#xD;
ugly green-panelled door. I think I must&#xD;
have been there ten minutes before any no-&#xD;
tice was taken of the noise I was making-&#xD;
enough to rouse the sleepers in Trinity&#xD;
churchyard. At length the old. man peered&#xD;
from a'window above.&#xD;
" What you want?" he asked.&#xD;
"Comedown here at once," I screamed,&#xD;
" and listen to what I've got to say."&#xD;
In a moment he opened the door-only&#xD;
partly however, and determined to oppose&#xD;
any effort which might be made to force an&#xD;
entrance. I saw that.&#xD;
" Let me in," I exclaimed. " I want to see&#xD;
your mistress&#xD;
"Ahje regrette; but impossible. Madame&#xD;
la Comtesse-poor lady, so very ill-very&#xD;
near to die; but she get better.&#xD;
Where are my canaries ? You dreadful&#xD;
old man, you knov well enough if you would&#xD;

"Ala Mademoiselle, and I who can not&#xD;
comprehend but so'very bad the English--&#xD;
and sonie other day when Madame will be&#xD;

door' iin my face.&#xD;
&#xD;
28&#xD;
&#xD;
The same scene or one very similar occurred&#xD;
every day for a month.&#xD;
There was no use remonstating with mre on&#xD;
the folly of my deternunation. I had re-&#xD;
solved to see the Countess Carry once more.&#xD;
At the end of a month I su1c'cecde(I in my de-&#xD;

rattle-trap of a house, when she suddenly&#xD;
burst out from a room at its remote endl.&#xD;
Though the door of this room had only bemi&#xD;
open for a moment, I saw that, broad sun-light&#xD;
as it was outside, the windows and curtains&#xD;
were closed and the room lit up with candles.&#xD;
There was a musty odor issued from it, and&#xD;
it appeared to me that on the air was borne&#xD;
a curious sort of floating down not unlike&#xD;
that which covers the breast of swans. The&#xD;
Countess brushed her dress nervously as she&#xD;
approached iiet; perhaps she was afraid some&#xD;
of this was clinging to her gown.&#xD;
" I wait my hirds," I said, roughly-" iy&#xD;
canaries. Where are they? "&#xD;
"Poo' child," she said in her bad English,&#xD;
is you often--what yon call--razy."&#xD;
"Madam," said I, " this is no'laughing&#xD;
matter. I am not crazy. Th dI'lay you were&#xD;
at our house I lost mny six beaumtifil canaries.&#xD;
You cannot wonder, after your singular con-&#xD;
versation that day, coupled with the disap-&#xD;
pearance of' my birds, that I should suspect&#xD;
you; and I ask you again, where are my&#xD;
canaries ?"&#xD;
"IMy child, was I or was I not to faint in&#xD;
your house '"&#xD;
" You (lid." I answered.&#xD;
And you suppose I amuse myself by to f4l&#xD;
down, to cut my head, and then to get up,&#xD;
take your birds, and fall to faint again P "&#xD;
I don't know what you did, or what you&#xD;
would do," I replied savagely.&#xD;
" But it is necessary to remember that I&#xD;
have plenty of money. Money buys every -&#xD;
thing-you know that. I can buy canaries."&#xD;
"You can't," I retorted, " you can't. You&#xD;
put that advertisement in, and no one had&#xD;
any birds to sell you. You know that as&#xD;
well as I do. Canaries are most difficult to&#xD;
get.- They come from a far distant country&#xD;
-China- or - or Amster lan -- or -'some&#xD;
place."&#xD;
What shall I say?" she replied shrug-&#xD;
ging her shoulders.  " If you want money&#xD;
from ne I will give money. I know noting&#xD;
about your birds. Ilow should I? What&#xD;
money'will you have ? "&#xD;
" None," I replied. " I want nothing but&#xD;
toy birds, and aj t cannot het them I will go&#xD;
away from you."&#xD;
"Cas't cela," she answered, " that is best.&#xD;
And alt-one word. Do not come here not&#xD;
one time more. I hate you very   uch. I&#xD;
might kill you.  I have no knives. Constant&#xD;
takes all the knives away from mtin'. But I&#xD;
have scissors. Ah, smon Dien! One oust&#xD;
have scissors for my work. Dom't you think&#xD;
I could kill you with miy seissor's? "&#xD;
" I dare say you could," I answered, " I&#xD;
&#xD;
dare say you have already killed tiny pe'r-&#xD;
sonlS, you wi'k'l woman&#xD;
" No, no," slie replied coolly ; " yoU tmae&#xD;
a mistake.   I have never killed any person.&#xD;
Ilirds-that is different.  lo not like to lii&#xD;
that. But que o'ordez-vous? It has to be done."&#xD;
)isgusted with herjargon amd t he sent itmient&#xD;
of it, I left tIhe house'.&#xD;
I neer saw the Countess again but on (nt'e&#xD;
occasion.  It was at the Governor's ball. Of&#xD;
coure we weie invited, aind as no one seemed&#xD;
to believe tme when I asserted that she was a&#xD;
ravmig mad-woman, she was imvited also.   I&#xD;
shall never forget how beautiful she looked .&#xD;
Iier hair was powdered until it was a lead&#xD;
white, and that was greatly the fashion theen.&#xD;
No doubt she was rouged slightly, and per-&#xD;
haps her eyelids blackened with no  uliun&#xD;
but it' this was the case it was most skillfully&#xD;
lone-executed probably by a master-hand.&#xD;
Her costume was composed of the richest&#xD;
materials, her diamonds were positively daz-&#xD;
zlinig to the eye, while over hem shoulders&#xD;
was fing a delicate lemon-coloreil cloak of&#xD;
some Curious and, to  mte, unknown tissue.&#xD;
At first I thought it was satin-theni t struck&#xD;
mute it was fur; ani when I drew nearer, what&#xD;
on earth do you suppose I fbuanl it was made&#xD;
of?&#xD;
Of the feathers of hundreds and hundreds&#xD;
of poor little canary birds&#xD;
Oh, mmy hears, I positively raved ! 'Ihis&#xD;
then was the grave of' my six little darlings.&#xD;
All gone-sacs hiced--killed   to sati-fy the&#xD;
vaumty of this horrible, passe, wickel old&#xD;

She was dancing in a beautiful, stately&#xD;
manner with the Governor, anl I walked&#xD;
straight utp to hmun and touched  himi oi the&#xD;
shoulder.  Mamma tried to hmold1 mem' back,&#xD;
but I would go.&#xD;
I)on't," said I--"dom't, youi' Exce'llen'mi'y&#xD;

me for my bobdness ; and, goimg houmm ithe&#xD;

rattle-trap house  with the green-pane lled&#xD;

She had taken ship for France.&#xD;
And now comes the strangest part ,of all.&#xD;
Before the year was out I got a letter f'om&#xD;

I have killed quantities of canaries. Yes,&#xD;
dear, I killed  Yours.  I squeezed  their&#xD;
throats so they should make no noise that&#xD;
day when vou thought I was fainting on the&#xD;
stairs. Was it riot cleverly played, that&#xD;
farce ? You see, for fifteen years I have&#xD;
been working at a beautiful garient. Re-&#xD;
ckerce in the extremtte -- a cloak composed&#xD;
entirely of canaries' feathers. It would have&#xD;
been a pity to disappoint me, would it not,&#xD;

an original idea, too ! My relatives in France&#xD;

My Client from Brooklyn.&#xD;
A lawyer's office is not a very attractive&#xD;
place, Its only merit, if a necessity can be&#xD;
called a merit, consists in its exquisite neat-&#xD;
ness.  Those innumerable bundles of pa-&#xD;
pers, systematically arranged, correctly la-&#xD;
belled, and jauntily tied with the much abus-&#xD;
ed red tape, those mysterious tin boxes,&#xD;
whose contents are happily unknown to the&#xD;
uninitiated, and spring-lock drawers, which&#xD;
open but to the master's key. That key I&#xD;
possessed. Of those drawers-of that room,&#xD;
I was the master. At No 21 Wilsop street I&#xD;
was monarch of all I surveyed, and itis but&#xD;
fair to say that my kingdom none did dispute.&#xD;
I hope it will not be understood by this that&#xD;
I was a poor starvehing, with an empty purse&#xD;
and a full green-bag. Nothing of the sort.&#xD;
I was overwhelmed with business, and if it&#xD;
had not been for the merest accident I might&#xD;
have sent away, and never seen my client&#xD;
from Brooklyn.&#xD;
She had called several times and sent in&#xD;
her name-Miss Wharton; but I was busy&#xD;
each day, and sent out polite regrets, and&#xD;
the desire that she might call again. She&#xD;
did so, and again I was occupied and could&#xD;
not see her. But, on a certain Monday&#xD;
morning, I sat alone in my office, conning&#xD;
over the papers in re Daily Comet.  The&#xD;
Daily Comet was a newspaper which had&#xD;
been set afloat by a capitalist who was assur-&#xD;
ed by the would-be editor that there was&#xD;
never such an investment offered as that&#xD;
which- was now presented to his admiring&#xD;
gaze. And, indeed, this was quite true.&#xD;
Never was there such an investment for simk-&#xD;
ing funds. The paper, deeply in debt before&#xD;
ny client took hold of it, had an odd peculi-&#xD;
arity of getting more so the more money&#xD;
furnished it; so, after bearing this literary&#xD;
atlas for a period of ten months, my client&#xD;
threw up the concern in disgust, and vowed&#xD;
lie would have nothing more to do with it.&#xD;
This, however, was easier said than done. It&#xD;
flavored of a good joke-his saying he would&#xD;
have "nothing more to do with it ;" for the&#xD;
Daily Comet was not a load to be shaken off&#xD;
lightly, as he found, to his cost.&#xD;
The Old Man of the Sea never clung to&#xD;
the sailor's back with more tenacity than did&#xD;
the floating debts of the Daily Comet to my&#xD;
unhappy client.  In vain he writhed and&#xD;
groaned and tried to repudiate ; creditors&#xD;
seemed, like the victims of jealousy, to make&#xD;
the meat they fed on, and no mushroom&#xD;
growth of a night ever sprung up with more&#xD;
rapidity than did this Daily Comet fungi,&#xD;
poisoning the happiness of my unfortunate&#xD;
friend-.&#xD;

&#xD;
On this particular Monday morning then,&#xD;
be it known,,I had an engagement in my&#xD;
office. with the gentleman in question, and I&#xD;
had left word that on no condition was I to&#xD;
be disturbed by other parties. The hour&#xD;
fixed for our meeting was ten o'clock, and I&#xD;
had specially enjoined my client to be pune-&#xD;
tual ; but spite of my request, ten, half past&#xD;
ten, a quarter to eleven arrived, and still no&#xD;
Cornet man. I rose impatiently, and called&#xD;
one of my clerks.&#xD;
" Rodgers," said I, "I can't stop any&#xD;
longer for Mr. Indette. Tell him to call&#xD;
again, At five."&#xD;
The clerk answered "yes'er," and hand-&#xD;
ed me, my umbrella from the corner,,(for it&#xD;
was raining cats and dogs, as the saying is).&#xD;
1 put on my hat and stepped out into the&#xD;
passage.&#xD;
It was rather dark there, and my eye-sight&#xD;
is none of the best, but I immediately saw a&#xD;
slender figure shrink back in. a corner as&#xD;
I emerged noisily from my rooms. I hate 1&#xD;
mystery. I hate'it of all things; and given&#xD;
a rainy morning in the (dull, suicidal month of&#xD;
November, a thark passage-way in an oflices-&#xD;
buildinig, a shrinking female dressed in black,&#xD;
looming out of a cobweby back-ground, and&#xD;
what can you make of it but a mystery of the&#xD;
most mysterious sort ? I was determined to&#xD;
probe it. Yes, probe it I would; and that&#xD;
quickly.&#xD;
"What do you want, my good woman?"&#xD;
I shouted, asif she were very deaf. I had&#xD;
somehow conceived the idea that she was old;&#xD;
so I called her " my good woman."  Women&#xD;
are generally more " good " at an advanced&#xD;
period of life than where they are young and&#xD;
pretty, and have temptations cast in their&#xD;
was'.&#xD;
The " good woman" came forward timidly,&#xD;
and then I saw that she was a girl of about&#xD;
twenty, with a fresh, blooming young face,&#xD;
but with a seared expression of eyes, as&#xD;
though she were laboring under a great fear&#xD;
of some terrible catastrophe about to happen.&#xD;
" I want to see Mr. Alexander Bywood,"&#xD;
said the " good woman " looking about as if&#xD;
such a desire were highly reprehensible, and&#xD;
would presently meet with the punishment it&#xD;
deserved.&#xD;
" That's me," said I, with a patronizing&#xD;
air.  I should have said "that's 1," shouldn't&#xD;
I'? I know it. We lawyer-folk ought to be&#xD;
mighty particular about our grammar. But&#xD;
we're not. We fall into error as well as un-&#xD;
legal people, once in a while.&#xD;
" Indeed, sir," said she in a tremulous&#xD;
voice and looking more frightened than ever;&#xD;
"could I-if it will not take too much of&#xD;
your time-,consult you about a little affair-&#xD;
very trifling to be sure-but I have come&#xD;
several times to see you and never succeeded&#xD;
--and it's something of a trip too-I live in&#xD;
Brooklyn."&#xD;
I confess I was cross that morning. The&#xD;
oetman had made roe hose a good hour of&#xD;
&#xD;
my time, and I had a vague idea that this was&#xD;
a client who was never going to pay me any-&#xD;
thing. 1 had no positive engagement out,&#xD;
and the Connet, in its eccentric flight, might&#xD;
dash in upon me at any minute ; so I resolved&#xD;
to go back. I put my latch-key into ire key-&#xD;
hole of my private office, and let my client&#xD;
from Brooklyn enter. Before she seated her-&#xD;
self she deftly slipped some notes into my&#xD;
hand, and I saw at a glance that they count-&#xD;
ed up into a larger fee than I generally re-&#xD;
ceived for a first visit; so it was evident she&#xD;
was not going to be an unremunerative client.&#xD;
The knowledge of this mollified in  a little,&#xD;
though I took up the notes with a disdainful&#xD;
air, and placed them far away from rme at the&#xD;
remote end of my desk as if they and their&#xD;
like were thoroughly beneath the notice of a&#xD;
great person like myself. This was far from&#xD;
being the case; for I was buying myself an&#xD;
expensive house in an up-town street, paying&#xD;
for it by tri-yearlf' instalments, and all fees,&#xD;
large or small were of the greatest use.&#xD;
Having pretty well satisfied her, I fancied,&#xD;
that I was a very important individual, with&#xD;
whom there must no fooling, I rocked myself&#xD;
back in my chair, clasped my hanls at the&#xD;
back of my head, and staring determine(lly at&#xD;
the ceiling, told her sharply to " go on."&#xD;
She went on. She went on very nicely.&#xD;
Poor young thing ! she went on with a most&#xD;
trying and delicate story, in such a clear,&#xD;
concise, modest little way, that before she&#xD;
had half finished her recital, my dried-njp&#xD;
parchmnent-like bit of a heart was all aglow&#xD;
with interest in my client from Brooklyn.&#xD;
It was an awful task, her getting out that&#xD;
story. But she did it, never omitting a de-&#xD;
tail that might enlighten me ; the same as a&#xD;
conscientious witness in an infanticide case&#xD;
" outs with " everything, from the iiminut est&#xD;
particular in regard to the birth of the child&#xD;
down to every known detail of its imuritder.&#xD;
Miss Wharton's story was to tihe following&#xD;
efleet-&#xD;
Her mother had (lied when she was too&#xD;
young to remember much about her, and her&#xD;
father, who had been in business in New York,&#xD;
had retiredlto Brooklyn, on a comfortable in-&#xD;
come, within the past three years. Ile was&#xD;
now little better than a hopeless invalid,&#xD;
however; and deeply grounded rr the hearts&#xD;
of both father and child was a reverential af-&#xD;
fection for the deceased mother. This quiet&#xD;
condition of affairs had gone on uninterrupt-&#xD;
edly until about two months back, when the&#xD;
peace of the family, or at least of Miss Whar-&#xD;
ton, had been seriously disturbed. Such&#xD;
disturbance was caused by the appearance&#xD;
of a strange looking mran, who, after having&#xD;
(logged the girl's footsteps for many days. at&#xD;
length succeeded in so working on her fears&#xD;
as to induce her to give him a few minutes&#xD;
hearinrr and in that hearing she learned his&#xD;
story.&#xD;
His story was to the effect that his name,&#xD;
coupled with his rank, was Captain Louis Be!-&#xD;

&#xD;
karp; that shortly after her mother's mar-&#xD;
riage, himself and she had met, and accord-&#xD;
ing to the Captain's story, fallen desperately&#xD;
in love with each otner. After the captain&#xD;
left the port of New York in his merchant-&#xD;
man, bound for the West Indies, he had re-&#xD;
ceived sev"'al letters of the most criminating&#xD;
character from the infatuated Mrs. Whar-&#xD;
ton, and the Captain now put it plainly to my&#xD;
client whether she did or did not think it was&#xD;
quite worth her while to hand him over one-&#xD;
half the monthly allowance her father was in&#xD;
the habit of giving her for the laudable purpose&#xD;
of inducing him to keep his tongue between&#xD;
his teeth. It appears Miss Wharton showing&#xD;
extraordinary firmness for her, had held out&#xD;
against this impudent demand until he told&#xD;
her plainly something which he kindly said&#xD;
he wished to spare her, and which was that&#xD;
she, Caroline Wharton, was his, Captain Bel-&#xD;
kamp's daughter! Of course this was a ter-&#xD;
rihle blow to my client. What one might call&#xD;
a staggerer. But she rallied enough to ask&#xD;
him what proof he had of such a thing.&#xD;
"Oh, proof! He had proof enough. He&#xD;
had destroyed all his darling Mrs. Whar-&#xD;
ton's letters-all except one, which told the&#xD;
whole story. Did Miss Wharton wish to'&#xD;
read it ?, " No, no," she replied shuddering.&#xD;
"Very well," answered the Captain, "very&#xD;
well, only when you do, my lear, there's a&#xD;
verbatim copy of it," and he slipped the paper&#xD;
in her hand. "The original I will part with&#xD;
for- let me see-I would give it to you,&#xD;
mind, for five hundred dollars.  In the&#xD;
meantime, dear, only half your monthly&#xD;
income will prevent my going to-oh-old&#xD;
Wharton-and destroying his belief in the-&#xD;
of course-you know-defunct angel. And&#xD;
as for you, my dear, it seems to me that the&#xD;
ties of consan-, what-d'ye-eall-'em-guini-&#xD;
ty, ought to induce you to give that much&#xD;
of your paltry money to your poorfather !"&#xD;
She shrank away from him thoroughly&#xD;
horrified, and for two months had paid him&#xD;
over half her income. This foolish acces-&#xD;
sion to his demands had of course embold-&#xD;
ened him to further importunity, and he was&#xD;
tow loudly calling for two hundred dollars&#xD;
in cash, in default of which he was to go&#xD;
within a week .to Mr. Wharton, lay the&#xD;
criminating letter before the sick man, and&#xD;
then take upon himself the pleasant task of&#xD;
going about to her friends in Brooklyn and&#xD;
informing them of the stain on Miss Whar-&#xD;
ton's birth. In this moment of sore distress&#xD;
(for she really could not get so much money&#xD;
and pay it out without fully accounting for'&#xD;
it) she thought she had better consult a law-&#xD;
yer, and came to me.&#xD;
I was infuriated at the conduct of this man&#xD;
Belkamp.   In all my professional experi-&#xD;
ence I had never heard of anything more&#xD;
base and vile, than pursuing this innocent&#xD;
young girl in so savage and indecent a man-&#xD;
ner. Those timid eyes of hers would have&#xD;
penetrated the heart of a stone-and this man&#xD;
&#xD;
who pretended to be her father-I did not&#xD;
believe a word of it!&#xD;
Looking at it either way, the wretch must&#xD;
be the greatest dastard that ever walked un-&#xD;
hung, supposing it were true ! What a hor-&#xD;
ruble act this, to be making capital out of the&#xD;
letter of a woman, who had doubtless loved&#xD;
him with foolish and blind devotion ! and if&#xD;
it were false, was it not unheard-of and hid-&#xD;
eous cruelty to be playing this sharp game on&#xD;
a guileless and inoffensive girl? Somehow, I&#xD;
had fully persuaded myself that it was a&#xD;
lie from beginning to end.&#xD;
"What a brute !" Iexclaimed, walking ex-&#xD;
citedly to the window. " What a complete&#xD;
brute ! Why, law .is far too good for such&#xD;
scoundrels as he! My advice is to hire some&#xD;
one to kick him." r&#xD;
Oh, no sir! " she answered hurriedly,&#xD;
"oh, no, pray don't think of anything of that&#xD;
kind ; you don't know, indeed you don't-&#xD;
how terribly vindictive he is ! Is that really&#xD;
your legal advice ?"&#xD;
Poor child ! I suppose she thought she&#xD;
had paid her fee to a curious sort of lawyer,&#xD;
whose first advice to her was to drop law and&#xD;
adopt kicking.&#xD;
" Where is that letter?" I asked, without&#xD;
replying to her question.&#xD;
SWhat letter?"&#xD;
"Why-the letter that this man has-or&#xD;
at least the copy. You said you had it."&#xD;
Ah yes, she had it. She had almost forgot-&#xD;
ten it. She had never read it. She had&#xD;
always shrunk from acquainting herself with&#xD;
more of the facts than she was already pos-&#xD;
sessed of. Read the letter, expecting to find'&#xD;
it of a very criminating character, but I was&#xD;
disappointed.. It was criminating in a nieas-&#xD;
ure, certainly. It was a silly woman's silly&#xD;
love-letter to her " Darling Louis."  There&#xD;
was but a single line of reference to my&#xD;
client.&#xD;
" Little Carrie TT'harton is well, and often&#xD;
asks after the gentleman who gave her the&#xD;
doll."&#xD;
Miss Wharton blushed deeply at these un-&#xD;
derscorings; her sensitive nature leading her&#xD;
at once to infer that this was a subtle hint of&#xD;
a common knowledge between the party&#xD;
writing and the party receiving. Of course,&#xD;
I observed to her that we had no certainty&#xD;
that such underscorings existed in the original&#xD;
document-this copy being in the precious&#xD;
hand-writing of Captain Louis Belkamp; and&#xD;
even if they did, might they not have been&#xD;
placed there by the hand of that honorable&#xD;
party himself?&#xD;
No, she was disposed to see it at its worst.&#xD;
Her mother-and she pronounced the word&#xD;
mother nervously-her mother had in sarcasm&#xD;
called her Carrie Wharton, because she had&#xD;
no right to that name, and-&#xD;
" And she called him, in sarcasm, the gen-&#xD;
tleman, because lie has no right to that name&#xD;
also, I suppose." ,&#xD;
" What is to be done ?" she asked in des-&#xD;
nair.&#xD;
&#xD;
33&#xD;
&#xD;
" Done ! why, it's as clear as daylight. I'll&#xD;
have the fellow arrested for illegal attempts&#xD;
to extort money from you-that's what I'll&#xD;
do."&#xD;
A perfect volley of no, no, no's, at this.&#xD;
She would not hear of it for a moment.&#xD;
Such a course, no matter how effectually it&#xD;
put an end to Captain Belkamp's extortion&#xD;
in the future, would give the affair a notorie-&#xD;
ty which she was determined at any cost to&#xD;
avoid. "-Only think how much sufI'ering it&#xD;
would cause poor, poor Papa; " and she&#xD;
blushed as she used the word. " Even sup-&#xD;
posing the letter a forgery; and the whole&#xD;
affair a fabrication," said my client, " it can-&#xD;
not fail to be almost as harmful to us as if it&#xD;
were strictly true. Every one has enemies,&#xD;
you know Mr. Bywood, especially men who&#xD;
have been or are in business, as well as mar-&#xD;
riageable girls," and here the timid eyes&#xD;
were lowered. "Papa and I have enemies,&#xD;
I presume-not that I know of any-but&#xD;
there are some doubtless, and they, would&#xD;
fasten upon this and hurt us just as much&#xD;
with it, as if the stories were all true, as I&#xD;
said before. Therefore; my great desire is&#xD;
to try and conciliate this matter, Mr. By-&#xD;
wood;   conciliate it. I assure you papa&#xD;
would die if lie were to hear a word of such&#xD;
a dreadful affair."&#xD;
I thought if any old man were silly enough&#xD;
to die just because a scoundrel was extorting&#xD;
money from  his daughter, he ought to be&#xD;
permitted to do it as expeditiously as possi&#xD;
ble. But I did not say this to Miss Whar-&#xD;
ton.&#xD;
" Would you therefore, Mr. Bywood, so far&#xD;
oblige me--I should take it as a personal fa-&#xD;
vor " (and I knew she was willing to pay for&#xD;
favors) "as to consent to see this person-&#xD;
this Captain Belkamp, and find out if some&#xD;
arrangement can't be made by which I can&#xD;
obtain possession of that letter."&#xD;
" He can fudge up another in twenty-four&#xD;
hours' time," sad I.d&#xD;
" No, not another like that," she said.&#xD;
And then she confessed to me that, though&#xD;
she was not very familiar with her mother's&#xD;
handwriting - Mrs. Wharton having died&#xD;
so many years ago-and though she had&#xD;
only obtained a hurried glimpse at the let-&#xD;
ter in this man's possession, she nevertheless&#xD;
felt convinced that the document was an au-&#xD;
thentic one, and was in thct what it was&#xD;
claimed to be by Captain Belkamp.&#xD;
a1I don't see what good there was in your&#xD;
coming to a lawyer, Miss Wharton, if you're&#xD;
going about it in such an unlawyer-like way.&#xD;
Why did not you address yourself to any-any&#xD;
male of your acquaintance."&#xD;
' I have very few male friends, Mr. By-&#xD;
wood, and none of those few would I take&#xD;
into my confidence. Oh, can you not under-&#xD;
stand that I wish to avoiti the scandal of it;&#xD;
that I want to keep thme kn'owledge of the ex-&#xD;
istence of such an affair away-altogether&#xD;
&#xD;
I said before, if conciliatory measures can&#xD;
be used- "&#xD;
" Conciliatory devils," T cjaculated, now&#xD;
myself becoming very unlawyer-like. "'' The&#xD;
scoundrel ought to have his neck wrung."&#xD;
"'Then I am to understand yom will not&#xD;
see him? " said Miss Wharton, i'ising.&#xD;
" Wait a minute. Whbenf are you going&#xD;
to see him again ? "&#xD;
"I have piomiused to meet himi in -&#xD;
Park, Brooklyn, to-morrow at two o'clock."&#xD;
Very well. 1 shall be there."&#xD;
She seemed very grateful, and as she was&#xD;
leaving I offered my hand. Not expecting&#xD;
this, the movement had fallen abortive be-&#xD;
fore she extended liers. I, seeing this, prof-&#xD;
fered mine once more, only to miss hers&#xD;
again ; and it was not until Rodgers opened&#xD;
the door and announced    Mr. Indette&#xD;
that I laughingly seized her hand. gave it a&#xD;
hearty shake, and thus took leave tor that&#xD;
day of my new client.&#xD;
On the morrow I crossed the ferrv accord-&#xD;
ing to her directions, and made the hest of&#xD;
my way to the Park she had mentioned. I&#xD;
was not familiar with the streets of Brooklyn.&#xD;
and was therefore obliged to enquire a halt'&#xD;
a dozen times before I fund the place of'&#xD;
rendezvous. Once in the Park it was all&#xD;
plain sailing: for seated on a stone heLnch,&#xD;
not a dozen yards from the gate, was the beau-&#xD;
tiful girl dressed as before in black, side by&#xD;
side with a shabby individual, whoi I at&#xD;
once recognized as her persecutor.&#xD;
Thinking me merely a passer-by, I sup-&#xD;
pose, Captain Belkaunp was doubt less somu("-&#xD;
what astonished when I stepped up to M iss&#xD;
Wharton and said-&#xD;
My dear young lady, would you oblige&#xD;
me by leaving me alone with this gentle-&#xD;
man? "&#xD;
She obeyed me without a word ; but wit II&#xD;
a look of gratitude on her sweet features&#xD;
which I shall never forget.&#xD;
I have seen a good number of scoundrels&#xD;
in my time, but of all the thorough ruffians I&#xD;
ever laid eyes upon I award the palm to&#xD;
Captain Louis Belkamp. Ile was a slouch-&#xD;
ing, skulking brute, with bleary drunken&#xD;
eyes, ill-kempt hair, and a straggling, irreg-&#xD;
ular beard. A thorough hang-dog counte-&#xD;
nance ; a face of itself that ought to have&#xD;
sent him to the gallows.&#xD;
" W ell," he said impudently' after T had&#xD;
surveyed him at my case and doubtless ex-&#xD;
pressed my disgust of hint by facial contor-&#xD;
tion, " well, what do you want with me?&#xD;
" I can  answer that  question in four&#xD;
words," I replied bluntly ! "'I want that&#xD;
letter."&#xD;
"Oh, indeed,'" exclaimel Captain Bel-&#xD;
kamp. " Oh, in'-deed ! she's beenI blowing,&#xD;
has ,he?  W ell, she'll wish  she hadn't.&#xD;
'That's all I can say. She'll wish she hadn't.&#xD;

" No matter," I replied "I am a man. I&#xD;
am not a timid girl, like Miss Wharton. - I&#xD;
want that letter."&#xD;
"And how, pray do you pro-pose to get&#xD;
it? By money?" lie asked eagerly. '&#xD;
No, I do not, you rascal," I exclaimed;&#xD;
" You've had the last dollar you shall get&#xD;
from Miss Wharton. Yes, and the last&#xD;
cent."&#xD;
"Oh, then you mean to get it by coaxing,"&#xD;
said Captain Belkamp with fine irony.&#xD;
"No, not by coaxing," I replied quietly.&#xD;
" You don't mean to say you'd try to get&#xD;
it by force; " he stuttered.&#xD;
" Well," I replied very coolly, " that's as&#xD;
may be. It seems to me as if I were a poor&#xD;
feeble old man like you (given to drink too,,&#xD;
which makes the strongest man powerless),&#xD;
and had possession of a document which&#xD;
I knew a muscular fellow like myself"-and&#xD;
I twirled my stick rapidly-" a muscular&#xD;
fidllow like myself wanted, I think I'd be&#xD;
likely to keepout of his way o' dark nights."&#xD;
"Why, you wouldn't knock me down,&#xD;
would you ? You wouldn't dare do it. I'd&#xD;
have the law of you."&#xD;
"Ah, ha ! But how about our having the&#xD;
law of you! eh ? What do you say to that?&#xD;
Threats, you know-threats-extorting mon-&#xD;
ey-aid so forth. You old scoundrel, that's&#xD;
what I ought to do now; and I would if I&#xD;
Lad my own way in the matter. I'm acting&#xD;
clean against principle and precedent and&#xD;
prudence in this affair. And you know it.&#xD;
But I'm obligedto do it because I promised.&#xD;
Only I say-keep out of my way o' dark&#xD;
nights."&#xD;
"Now look here," said the Captain, trying&#xD;
the " conciliatory" himself, " what's the use&#xD;
of being so ill-tempered about it?  Why not&#xD;
give me something a little handsome-and&#xD;
take the letter-and be done with it, for good&#xD;
and all."&#xD;
" Not a cent ! " I shouted emphatically.&#xD;
"Not one. Understand that at once -&#xD;
and-" repeating what I saw had been an&#xD;
effective phrase-" keep out of my way o'&#xD;
dark nights."&#xD;
" Now, there's no use of you're being so&#xD;
violent. Mr.-whatever your name may&#xD;
be. No use under the sun. What earthly&#xD;
good would it do for you to attack me of a&#xD;
dark night, as you say? What good would&#xD;
it do you?"&#xD;
"I might obtain possession of the letter,"&#xD;
I said.&#xD;
" No you wouldn't. You wouldn't do any&#xD;
such thing. You wouldn't, I tell you. I&#xD;
dor&amp;amp; carry it about me."&#xD;
He saw immediately that he was giving me&#xD;
a dee to its whereabouts by this avowal,&#xD;
and it was evident he at once repented hav-&#xD;
ing made it.&#xD;
" I aught not to have told you that," con-&#xD;
tinued the ruffianly old scoundrel. " But I&#xD;
had to 'de it. I wanted to prevent your be-&#xD;
&#xD;
IS'S MONEY.&#xD;
having ugly toward me, which wouldn't do&#xD;
the slightest good. I repeat-not the slight-&#xD;
est."&#xD;
"I'm not so easily humbugged as you&#xD;
think, Mr.-Captain Belkamp. And I've&#xD;
dealt with too many wily old rascals like&#xD;
yourself not to know how \they will lie, and&#xD;
swear to their lies, to throw an adversary off&#xD;
the scent. I dare say you've got the letter&#xD;
now in that breast-pocket," I said, moving&#xD;
up toward him a little menacingly.&#xD;
" I wish I may die if I have," he whined,&#xD;
in a maudlin tone, at the same time empty-&#xD;
ing, not - only that but every pocket- about&#xD;
his clothing. " I haven't it at all. Look&#xD;
yourself. Examine every scrap o' paper I've&#xD;
got about me. Why, you must know it's&#xD;
hardly likely that a poor old fellow like me&#xD;
-who is as weak as a reed, and gets drunk&#xD;
as you say-it's hardly likely I'd carry&#xD;
around such a precious document as that.&#xD;
Worth money to me, that letter is, and&#xD;
came, of course, from my dear-well, she's&#xD;
dead now, poor thing. Why, I was robbed&#xD;
the other night; got a little how-come-you&#xD;
so, and the next morning found that I was&#xD;
robbed. Stolen every dollar from me, sir;&#xD;
money too, that Miss-that "is, my dear&#xD;
daughter, you know-had given me! Too&#xD;
bad, wasn't it? No, no. Catch Loo Bel-&#xD;
kamp being such a fool as to carry that let-&#xD;
ter around."&#xD;
"Well, if you haven't got it about your&#xD;
person, you've got it~ secreted somewhere,"&#xD;
I said.&#xD;
" Certainly I have. Cer-tainly I have.&#xD;
But where? That's the question, WHERE ? "&#xD;
I rose to go, for I was getting so out of&#xD;
temper that in a couple of minutes longer I&#xD;
felt I should pounce on this blackguard and&#xD;
give him a sound drubbing, which would&#xD;
have done "no good," as he said-and&#xD;
might have done a great deal of harm, in the&#xD;
way of leading to an exposure, which my&#xD;
client so seriously dreaded. As I was walk-&#xD;
ing off, Captain Belkamp spoke again:&#xD;
"If you want to know where the letter is "&#xD;
(and involuntarily I stopped), "I'll tell you.&#xD;
It's in Bank. In the. bank of a dear friend&#xD;
of mine. He'd go through brandy and&#xD;
water-I mean fire and water,-for me.&#xD;
So would his Safe. It's in his Safe. Great&#xD;
strong safe.  Five locks.  Secret keys.&#xD;
Letter scaled up-my seal-tied with red&#xD;
tape, Ha ! '"Ha!  Where is that bank?&#xD;
Don't you wish you knew ? Where is that&#xD;
Safe P Don't you wish you knew? Where&#xD;
is that LETTER? Don't you wish you knew&#xD;
-wish you knew-wish you knew ?"&#xD;
He rubbed his villainous old hands to-&#xD;
gether, chuckled in a sort of low laugh, and.&#xD;
supporting himself on a heavy notched old&#xD;
cane, shambled away.&#xD;
I returned to town, and took no steps in&#xD;
the matter for more than a week. I wanted&#xD;
the Captain to believe that I' had dropped&#xD;
the affair, seeing the utter hopelessness of&#xD;
&#xD;
JOHN MORRIS'S MONEY.&#xD;
&#xD;
ever obtaining possession of the letter for&#xD;
which (for the sake of her mother's rep-&#xD;
utation and for her own position in society)&#xD;
I knew and he knew, Miss Wharton would&#xD;
give every dollar she could muster.&#xD;
At the end of ten days I again went to&#xD;
Brooklyn.&#xD;
It was a very easy matter to find out&#xD;
where Captain Belkatmp lodged. The land-&#xD;
lady was a talkative old woman, whom I&#xD;
frightened into secresy by my legal bearing,&#xD;
and the assurance that though she had un-&#xD;
wittingly been so unfortunate as to harbor&#xD;
an escaped state's prison convict in the per-&#xD;
son of Captain Belkamp, I would gracious-&#xD;
ly protect her from all harm if she would&#xD;
carefully aid tme in my plans, and abstain&#xD;
from giving her lodger the slightest hint that&#xD;
the " dogs of law" were on his track. This&#xD;
she promised; so frightened by my story'&#xD;
that she was nearer dead than alive. But I&#xD;
told her that her sanitary and social condition&#xD;
would be better after I had ousted her lodg-&#xD;
er-but this I said must be done cautiously.&#xD;
Finding the man was out (but whether&#xD;
he would return late or early the landlady&#xD;
could not tell,) I ordered Mrs. Daff to give&#xD;
me the pass key of her rooms, so that I might&#xD;
take a minute survey of Captain Belkamp's&#xD;
pretises.&#xD;
She gave it, without the least hesitation.&#xD;
Captain Belkamp's room was qnite at the&#xD;
top of the house, with a sloping ceiling, and&#xD;
two low windows looking down on the&#xD;
shabby street. His bed, a fit lair for such a&#xD;
dirty wretch as himself, had not been made&#xD;
since its occupancy of the preceding night.&#xD;
At the foot of the bed stood an oaken cup-&#xD;
board or wardrobe, and this piece of furniture&#xD;
I carefully examined, for, spite of Captain&#xD;
Belkamp's story about the letter being de-&#xD;
posited in the " bank" of a " dear friend"&#xD;
who would go through " brandy and wa-&#xD;
ter" for him, I somehow felt convinced that&#xD;
the "bank," and the " safe" and the " let-&#xD;
ter " itself were all within the four dirty white-&#xD;
washed   walls which  now   encompassed&#xD;
tile. If it were true that lie had deposited&#xD;
it, then of course the figurative search for&#xD;
the needle in the haystack were no more use-&#xD;
less than mine. But I felt that the story was&#xD;
a fabrication from beginning to end. Head&#xD;
men at the banks do npt usually select&#xD;
their friends from the low grade of society&#xD;
in which move such persons as Belkatmp and&#xD;
his -ilk. I felt that the letter was concealed&#xD;
in this room.&#xD;
I was proceeding in my search, peering&#xD;
imto every nook, examining every corner,&#xD;
when I was suddenly stopped by the loud&#xD;
voice of Mrs. Daff on the stairs. In a mo-&#xD;
meut I understood that Captain Belkamp had&#xD;
returned unexpectedly, and that she was try-&#xD;
ing to prevent his going up.&#xD;
" What the devil are you trying to keep&#xD;
nie out of my own room for? " I heard him&#xD;
shout at the pool frightened creature.&#xD;
&#xD;
SI'm  doing nothing of the kind," she&#xD;
answered. " I say I was cleaning up there,&#xD;
and went in there with my pass key, which&#xD;
I left in the door. And that is all. And&#xD;
was thinking, only thinking, that you night&#xD;
think it just the least bit strange that I sliouhl&#xD;
go in your room when you was out ; and if&#xD;
you'd just step away for ten minutes Ill&#xD;
have your room cleaned beautiful and all&#xD;
tidy, so as you'd hardly know it--wil you:&#xD;
All this in an extremely high key, evidently&#xD;
intended to reach my ear, and spoken by my&#xD;
ally below.&#xD;
" No, I'll do nothing of the kind," he re-&#xD;
plied angrily, "° and as for your pass key Ill&#xD;
take it. Curse it, I won't have anybody pry -&#xD;
ing into my matters, and going into my room&#xD;
when I'm absent. Get out of miy way, I tell&#xD;
you ; Im going up."&#xD;
I heard her heavy footsteps descending&#xD;
kitchen-ward, and his mounting leisurely to&#xD;
the little cell in which I was regularly caged.&#xD;
Here was a dilemma for a respectable anl&#xD;
well-to-do lawyer!    ilere a disgraceful&#xD;
situation ! Why had I conic here to this low&#xD;
dirty place, to do the low dirty work of a po-&#xD;
lice detective?&#xD;
Why ?&#xD;
Because I was desperately. madly, insane-&#xD;
ly, outrageously in love with my client from&#xD;
Brooklyn. I would have done anything for&#xD;
her-anything to obtain her gratitude. I&#xD;
wanted to get this letter for her myselt-my-&#xD;
sef-without a finger's turn of aid froni aniy&#xD;
detective or lawyer or private individual in&#xD;
the world-or Brooklyn. In the meantime&#xD;
lie was mounting-mounting-and now had&#xD;
reached the last step of the staircase. Qiiek&#xD;
as thought I sprang into the wardrobe a il&#xD;
closed the doors, holding them  together in-&#xD;
side. This was my only move. He might&#xD;
not want to get open the wardrobe; if lie&#xD;
(lid-why I must just make the best of it.&#xD;
Knock him down, perhaps, and char away.&#xD;
But I (lid not want anything of this&#xD;
kind. I wanted to keep quiet. As yet I&#xD;
had not discovered anything to give ie t'he&#xD;
slightest trace of the letter, and had the old&#xD;
wretch once become aware that his private&#xD;
quarters were likely to be entered at any&#xD;
moment by his enemy, lie would have rc-&#xD;
moved the precious paper of course at once.&#xD;
As I crouched in the cupboard, my limbs&#xD;
stiflleting with the posture, and i clist&#xD;
heavimg with short gasps from the confined&#xD;
and imptire state of the atmosphere, I felt&#xD;
then on what a wild-goose chase I had started.&#xD;
I looked like the culprit-a regular jack-ini-&#xD;
the-box, lie like the free man, siiokmig his&#xD;
short pipe, and walking deliberately u p and&#xD;
down the narrow room. One great hem&#xD;
buoyed me up-might lie not now go to thm&#xD;
letter, thus showing me the hiding place&#xD;
For I cotild disteintly see all his miiovetmints&#xD;
from ao crack in the wood of the cupboard.&#xD;

&#xD;
I pf&#xD;
Oil)1&#xD;
pilt&#xD;
I "&#xD;
&#xD;
back to his room, evidently for the purpose&#xD;
of reposing himself merely ; for he smoked&#xD;
one pipe after another, lolled on the bed, got&#xD;
up again, loafed up and down the floor,&#xD;
gazed stupidly out of the window, whistled a&#xD;
nautical air, and then finally began making a&#xD;
fresh toilette, prior, perhaps, to going out&#xD;
again. His ablutions were of the simplest&#xD;
character, consisting of a slight "dab" with a&#xD;
wet towel on his forehead and cheeks, and a&#xD;
half second's immersion of his finger tips in&#xD;
a basin with a limited supply of water.&#xD;
Then the Captain took off his shirt, and fling-&#xD;
img it on the top of a very diminutive pile of&#xD;
soiled linen, proceeded to unlock his trunk in&#xD;
search of a clean garment. The trunk, of&#xD;
course-the trunk ! The letter must be in&#xD;
there ! I watched him eagerly as he laid out&#xD;
t he trifles it contained, and then after select-&#xD;
ing the second shirt, perhaps because it was&#xD;
it better condition than the first, he laid them&#xD;
back again one by one. He had emptied it,&#xD;
I could see, to the very bottom, and there&#xD;
was not the slightest vestige of writing or-&#xD;
papers !&#xD;
This was a disappointment. With mute&#xD;
rage I saw the old fellow complete his toi-&#xD;
lette, leaving off the ragged-bottomed trow-&#xD;
sits which lie had worn when lie entered,&#xD;
and putting on a somewhat better pair, which&#xD;
hung over the chair back, and whose pockets&#xD;
I had previously searched; he slipped on the&#xD;
same coat, gave a coquettish brush to his&#xD;
hair, and then devoted his attention and the&#xD;
efforts of a ragged silk handkerchief to the&#xD;
smoothing of his hat. I conjectured at once&#xD;
-and my surmise I ultimately proved to be&#xD;
true-that he was getting himself up in this&#xD;
seductive style for the purpose of waylaying&#xD;
Miss Wharton. I could have killed him&#xD;
where he stood. I am not sanguinary as a&#xD;
general thing, but I could have murdered&#xD;
that man in cold blood. For was he not&#xD;
persecuting, tormenting; fiendishly annoying&#xD;
my love, my beauty, my darling, my client&#xD;
from Brooklyn?&#xD;
At length he went. I could hear him lock-&#xD;
mng the door outside and removing the key-&#xD;
the pass key, which he doubtless pocketed&#xD;
according to his threat. Thump, bump went&#xD;
his feet and his cane, step by step, down the&#xD;
tackling stair-case. Thump, bump,-faint-&#xD;
et, fainter, fainter. I ran to the window and&#xD;
saw him in the street.&#xD;
And for myself! Here was I, a highly re-&#xD;
spectable person, the counsel for the great&#xD;
Mr Indette of the Daily Comet, besides be-&#xD;
itg the attorney in numberless prominent&#xD;
suits for numberless prominent persons, lock-&#xD;
ed up in a dirty garret by a half-tipsy old&#xD;
sailor!&#xD;
I examined the lock of the door. I could&#xD;
not possibly force it. It was too strong for&#xD;
that. But I immediately remembered tmy&#xD;
ally below stairs, Mrs. Daff, whmom I did not&#xD;
doubt would soon come to my rescue. I did&#xD;
not want hser yet. No, not yet, by any&#xD;
&#xD;
means. I wanted to be alone and undisturb-&#xD;
ed, so that I might hunt for the letter.&#xD;
I began by ripping up the old carpet con-&#xD;
fined here and there by small-headed tacks,&#xD;
and thrusting my hand under as far as it would&#xD;
go. No letter. This work was tiresome in&#xD;
the extreme, for I was without tools of any&#xD;
kind except my small pocket-knife. With&#xD;
this I ripped open the mattress, and probed&#xD;
there. With no suceesss. Pillows likewise&#xD;
were obliged to undergo the same Vendal treat-&#xD;
ment. And all for nought-all for nought !&#xD;
Again I turned to the trunk. The lock of&#xD;
this gave way with one strong pull; the rot-&#xD;
ten wood ejecting the poor old lock, and look-&#xD;
ing as 'if greatly relieved by the operation.&#xD;
I need not have given my time to this, for I&#xD;
had seen before that there were no papers in&#xD;
it. But I wished again to assure myself, and&#xD;
I did-that there was nothing in it. About&#xD;
the chairs there was not the possibility of&#xD;
concealing even the smallest article ;'the&#xD;
seats were of cane-not stuffing.&#xD;
The table which also served as wash-stand,&#xD;
contained in its little drawer (which came out&#xD;
half-way and then stuck there, refusing to go&#xD;
either back or forward) a rusty razor and a&#xD;
leather strap. Even the Raven would have&#xD;
been obliged to confess that there -was "noth-&#xD;
ing more, only these-and nothing more."&#xD;
Bynmerely raising myself and lifting my arm&#xD;
I could pass my hand along the ceiling. In&#xD;
some places the plaster was broken, and it&#xD;
struck me that as the letter was a small ob-&#xD;
ject it would be easy enough to insert it in&#xD;
any one of these little woolly irterstices,&#xD;
standing greatly in need of a coat of white-&#xD;
wash. " A coat of whitewash !" I repeated.&#xD;
to myself in thought-" they need a coat and&#xD;
a pair of trowsers of whitewash!" that was&#xD;
my joke, and a very good one I thought it.&#xD;
A coat and a pair of trousers of -&#xD;
A coat and a pair of trowsers--and a pair&#xD;
of trowsers-a pair of trousers!&#xD;
By Jingo!   Why didn't I think of them&#xD;
before ? That was not the pair I searched&#xD;
before he came in ! Certainly not.  That&#xD;
was the pair he took off.&#xD;
I seized them and turned both pockets in-&#xD;

hand ovbr the seams, coolly ripping them&#xD;
open in such places as they appeared thicker&#xD;
than need  be, carefully investigating the&#xD;
filthy mud-crusted  hems at the' bottom.&#xD;
Nothing-nothing. I flung them   from mite&#xD;
in disgust and despair.&#xD;
As they lay with their two black bag-like&#xD;
portions inaptlyy called "legs ") sprawled&#xD;
apart on the bed before me, I saw that up to&#xD;
this moment I had overlooked something im-&#xD;
portant. There was a third pocket which I&#xD;
had not examined. It was a watch or fob-&#xD;
pocket, and close to the waist-hand peering&#xD;
quietly out, as otte might say, was the tip of&#xD;
a folded paper.&#xD;
My heart actually stopped beating; or so&#xD;

I observed that Captain Belkamp got safe-&#xD;

"Well, then listen. This young lady was&#xD;
just three years old before I ever saw her&#xD;

With a little chirp of joy Carry pressed&#xD;
(lose against me and looked gratefully up&#xD;
into my eyes as if she fully considered that the&#xD;
fact of her being the legitimate offspring of&#xD;
her lawfully wedded parents was due entirely&#xD;
to my single and unaided efforts. I received&#xD;
her tribute of thanks without disclaimer.&#xD;
"And now, if you promise you won't dis-&#xD;
turb me, but just let ie go my way and you&#xD;
yours, I'll tell you something else about it."&#xD;
I would promise nothing. I felt guilty to&#xD;
the last degree in allowing this fellow to go&#xD;
scot free, probably to again prey upon some&#xD;
innocent party. But Carry wanted secresy ;&#xD;
what could I do?&#xD;
I did not answer; but I knew that Miss&#xD;

should say, " Tell what you like: I'll be re-&#xD;

" That letter was not written by your moth-&#xD;

"What!" we both exclaimed.&#xD;
" No. Don't be angry. It was written&#xD;
by a cousin of hers, whose handwriting was&#xD;
very similar.  She was Unmarried, and we&#xD;
were engaged, but the whole thin fell&#xD;

I could stand it no longer. I made a&#xD;

vining my purpose with an alacrity of which&#xD;
I did not deem him capable, flew out of the&#xD;

married ine-bless her. She said she fell 'n&#xD;
love with me the first day she ever saw m,&#xD;
at the time when we had all that missing-fire&#xD;
sort of business in our first shaking of&#xD;
hands; but, dear me ! I was in love with her&#xD;
at least twenty minutes before that !&#xD;
I think I've told you all. Oh, by George!&#xD;
yes; there is just one thing. No, on second&#xD;
thoughts, I'd rather not mention that. It&#xD;
seems so stupid. Besides, Carry would be&#xD;
vexed, if she knew I'd told it.&#xD;
You wont mention it, eh?  Honor bright&#xD;
now! Make me look such a guy, you see&#xD;
-an old fellow like me, as I am now at forty-&#xD;
five, with a red face and a bald spot on the&#xD;
top of my head, as big as the palm of your&#xD;
hand. Ha ! ha!    By George ! yes-that's&#xD;
it; you've hit it.&#xD;
She is-she is jealous!&#xD;
Stupid of her, isn't it? Such a pretty&#xD;
creature as she is, and such a fat old cur-&#xD;
nutdgion as I am! But she doesn't see my&#xD;
defects. Oh .dear, no. She kisses me so&#xD;
sweetly every day before I go to the office,&#xD;
and calls me all those mythological fel-&#xD;
lows, Beau Brunmmel, you know, and D'Orsay&#xD;
and Apollo and Adonis and the rest. Ahi,&#xD;
come now, don't laugh. That's really not&#xD;
kind of you; and-I say, one word before you&#xD;
go ! As you value my friendship don't say&#xD;
anything of this to Carry, for I've made&#xD;
her two promises--one is not to reveal her&#xD;
weakness, and the other is to humor that&#xD;
weakness by never again serving a lady-&#xD;
client from Brooklyn.&#xD;
&#xD;
of mine, who died in Australia. some eleven cc&#xD;
or twelve years ago. I was a poor lad when 11&#xD;
I first went to them; but I think my employ- In&#xD;
ers respected me, and that they had coni- i&#xD;
dence in my honesty the story wvdl show. In&#xD;
It happened at that time that our firm had th&#xD;
business relations in New York with a party te&#xD;
who owed them what is widely knwn in the&#xD;
commercial world as a " bad debt," and this ti&#xD;
bad debt, amounted to several thousands of i&#xD;
dollars. They had tried hard to collect it-&#xD;
tried in every way-and failed signally. They w&#xD;
had tried lawyers and doctors, and threats&#xD;
and persuasions, and vows of vengeance and y&#xD;
promises to " knock off" a good round sum, tl&#xD;
but to'all their manouvres the bad debtors&#xD;
in New York smiled sweetly at the mad n&#xD;
creditors in New Orleans, and continued as&#xD;
much in debt as before.                 fi&#xD;
This being the state of the case, it was at t&#xD;
last proposed to send me on to the Metrop-&#xD;
olis, to -ee if the actual presence of an au-&#xD;
thorized deputy, coming fresh from the spot, t&#xD;
would not have the desired effect. I had n&#xD;
full power to receipt for the firm, and the t&#xD;
only fear was that I should get nothingtof&#xD;
receipt for from the recalcitrant Newv York-&#xD;
ers. I took passage on one of the fine&#xD;
"packet-boats " plying between New Or- t&#xD;
leans and Cincinnati, and, after rather a te-&#xD;
dious trip of five days on the river, found -c&#xD;
myself at the picturesque landing of the c&#xD;
Queen City of the West. We had arrived&#xD;
too late for the midnight traim for the East,s&#xD;
and there was nothing for Inc to do but to&#xD;
,wait until the next morning, at eight o'clock,&#xD;
when the express train went out. Many ofI&#xD;
my fellow-passengers slept that night on the&#xD;
boat; but I was tired of the narrow berth in&#xD;
which I had lain and tossed for five nights,1&#xD;
and, late as it was, I got a strapping negro&#xD;
to shoulder, my trunk and carry it into a&#xD;
public-house on the wharf.&#xD;
This house was called the " River Queen&#xD;
Hotel," and was a favorite with those men&#xD;
who earned a livelihood on the river. It&#xD;
borO a reputable name, and the charges were&#xD;
moderate. Both of these facts made it a de-&#xD;
sirable place of resort. I had   stopped&#xD;
there once or twice before, and the landlord&#xD;
(an ex-clerk on one of the steamboats) rec-&#xD;
ognized me as I entered.&#xD;
" How de do, sir! How; de do ! coming&#xD;
to spend a few (lays in Cmenciratti?"&#xD;
Ie rubbed his hands together cheerfully&#xD;
as he spoke, but, little as I knew the man, it&#xD;
struck me that beneath his apparent good&#xD;
spit its there lay some unspoken trouble&#xD;
which he was trying his best to conceal.&#xD;
No," I answered; " I am going East&#xD;
to-morrow by the first train ; but I wanted a&#xD;
good night's rest in a bed before I started:&#xD;
so I came here."&#xD;
aSuttaily, sir suttainly," he returned, still&#xD;
arth potr did so, and thie landlord ac--&#xD;
&#xD;
ompanied meto the room assigned me, and&#xD;
usied himself with some trifling details for&#xD;
y comfortable occupancy of it during lat,&#xD;
ght. Everybody spoke of' hin as a good-&#xD;
earted, well-meaning man, and, knowing&#xD;
is, I asked him blankly what was the mat-&#xD;
r with hin to-might.&#xD;
"Did you observe that -there was some-&#xD;
iing the matter with me when you canme&#xD;
S?" he asked, suspiciously.&#xD;
" Yes, I did," I said : ' you started&#xD;
lien I opened the door."&#xD;
" Did I? Well, I guess I'd better tell&#xD;
ou the whole of the story, or you might&#xD;
think there was something wrong i ne.&#xD;
I might. That's true enough."  W hat&#xD;
nade you start when I opened the door .&#xD;
" Because," he answered, slowly, 11the&#xD;
ist glimpse I got of you I thought you was&#xD;

T" Ie Coroner ! "&#xD;
" Yes, the Corioner. We've sent for bilim,&#xD;

" Drowned !  I exclaimed.    how did&#xD;

I don't know a thing about it. lIe was&#xD;
down stairs, di ikiiig at the bar, about eight&#xD;

saying he was going for a walk on the wharf.&#xD;
Seems to me it couldn't have been more than&#xD;
a couple of hours after that when two mnci&#xD;
brought in his dead body. He had been&#xD;
drowned."&#xD;
" Do you think it was an accident, or foul&#xD;
play? " I asked.&#xD;
" I think it must have been an accident.&#xD;
Perhaps the liquor he'd taken made him kind&#xD;
o' unsartin where lie was going. 1 dont&#xD;

"Don't forget to have me waked at half&#xD;
past six."&#xD;
No fear. Good-night, sir."&#xD;
"Good-night."&#xD;
Ile left me.&#xD;
I confess I did not think much more about&#xD;
the drowned man after the door closed on&#xD;
the landlord., I am not at all a heartless&#xD;
person, but Major Jim was a stranger to&#xD;
me ; I had never seen him ; never should do&#xD;
so; I was tired and sleepy, and had only a&#xD;
few hours for repose before me; so, hastily&#xD;
doffing my clothing, -I tumbled into bed,&#xD;
and was soon fast asleep.&#xD;
How long I slept I cannot tell, but my&#xD;
slumber was an uneasy one. I dreamed that&#xD;
I had collected the bad debt in New York,&#xD;
and was returning home with the money,&#xD;
when Iwas set upon by thieves, overpowered,&#xD;
and robbed of every cent. I awoke sud-&#xD;
denly, and, sitting up in bed, I looked around&#xD;
the room for the robbers.&#xD;
It had been a dream, and thdre were no&#xD;
robbers whatever. It was not yet daylight,&#xD;
and the fire was still burning brightly enough&#xD;
to make all the objects about the room as&#xD;
visible as though it were morning. I was&#xD;
just composing -myself to slumber again&#xD;
when the door, which I had locked and bolt-&#xD;
ed inside, opened noiselessly, and gave&#xD;
ingress to a man,-a man in a brown over-&#xD;
coat lined with gray silk, and with a great&#xD;
cluster diamond pin stuck in his shirt !&#xD;
He walked over to the fire and began to&#xD;
dry his clothes which were dripping wet!&#xD;
I can't say I felt afraid. I knew at once,&#xD;
or thought I knew, who it was, by the land-&#xD;
lord's description.  It immediately struck&#xD;
me there had been some mistake about his&#xD;
death.&#xD;
"Say, stranger !" I sang out, "what are&#xD;
you doing in my room?"&#xD;
"4Drying my clothes !" he answered, with-&#xD;
out turning around.&#xD;
Who are youJ"&#xD;
"Major Jim!"&#xD;
" Oh, I'm so glad!" I exclaimed. "The&#xD;
landlord will be delighted. Then you were&#xD;
not drowned after all!"&#xD;
"Yes, I was!" he said, still without turn-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
" Yes, but I mean not dead.      Not&#xD;
(drowned-dead !"&#xD;
" I am dead! " he said.&#xD;
" Oh, nonsense !"&#xD;
"If you doubt it, look at me!"&#xD;
He turned his face to me now, and to my&#xD;
dying day, I shall never forget the sight !&#xD;
The eyes were open, and were distended,&#xD;
glassy and staring. The jaw had dropped,&#xD;
and was fied in that position. Across the&#xD;
.forehead there was a deep cut, from which&#xD;
thick, black blood was sluggishly issuing. and&#xD;
&#xD;
the soft brown locks were covered with green&#xD;
slime from the river!&#xD;
" Do Iou doubt it now ?" he asked, almost&#xD;
in triunaph.&#xD;
N-o," I answered, horror-stricken,&#xD;
He approached the bed, and placed him-&#xD;
self in an easy posture across its foot, while&#xD;
I sat bolt upright at its head, with every drop&#xD;
of blood in my heart frozen into ice.&#xD;
"I suppose I'm not a very pleasant coin-&#xD;
panion just now," he continued, " though&#xD;
when-when I was alive, what man on the&#xD;
river was as good company as Major Jim?&#xD;
If I was kind o' lucky at 'seven-up ' or at&#xD;
' euchre,' nobody ever seemed to feel hard&#xD;
agin me. Ahi! well, that's all over now !"&#xD;
And he heaved a sigh which .so greatly&#xD;
awakened my pity that it almost dispelled&#xD;
my fear.&#xD;
Still I did not speak.&#xD;
"You may be surprised at my coming in&#xD;
on you in this way," resumed the ghastly&#xD;
" sporting-nian "-Alas! the " sport " was&#xD;
sorry enough now !-" You may be surprised&#xD;
at my coming in, and waking you up when&#xD;
you was sleeping quietly, and not thinking&#xD;
of the poor chap-me, you know-who, at&#xD;
this minute is laid out down stairs in the&#xD;
back parlor, with two men watching him!"&#xD;
"Are you a ghost," I murmured, faintly,&#xD;
" or a madman ? "&#xD;
"Idon't feel myself justified in answering&#xD;
that question ; so, with  your permission,&#xD;
we'll lay it on the table as they do in Con-&#xD;
gress, you know. All I've got to say to you&#xD;
is this: I've come here to do you a favor, and&#xD;
if you want to know how, listen! If you&#xD;
don't, say the word, and P11 be free to go."&#xD;
Although I would have given a kingdom&#xD;
if I had had it to get rid of this nocturnal&#xD;
visitor, I nevertheless mastered my fears, and&#xD;
begged him toremain.&#xD;
" It appears, I'm obliged to tell the secret&#xD;
to the first man that sleeps in this room. If&#xD;
he-refuses to avail himself of niy knowledge,&#xD;
then I've got to tell the next man that sleeps&#xD;
here, and so on until some one takes advan-&#xD;
tage of it. It's about money, and for that&#xD;
reason Pd rather Korley should know it, for&#xD;
Korley is about as good as they make 'cin&#xD;
now-a-days.".&#xD;
Korley was the landlord.&#xD;
"If Korley had slept here to-night, I could&#xD;
have told him; but, poor fellow, lie's down&#xD;
stairs watching my body, while you, an outsid-&#xD;

" I have not heard it yet," I said,&#xD;
" No," he answered; " but here it is.&#xD;
Do you see that hearthstone ? "&#xD;
"Yes," I answered. "It is cracked."&#xD;
"It is not only cracked but broken. Bro-&#xD;
ken clear through. With any strong article for&#xD;
a wedge. the biggest blade of a knife for in-&#xD;
stance, you could lift half of it up as easy as&#xD;
rollin' oflf a log. The right half of it-what do&#xD;
&#xD;
you think you'll find under the right half of&#xD;
it ? Come, now, guess ! Guess wha t a luck&#xD;
' fell ' like myself-a high old sport, who's&#xD;
been, travelling up and lown between here&#xD;
and Orleans for the last ten years-guess1&#xD;
what he'd have to hide under a hearthstone&#xD;
Guess ! "                     .       '&#xD;
"Money?"&#xD;
"Ha, ha ! " he shouted ; and his laugh&#xD;
was so loud   that it seemed  impossible&#xD;
that those below should not hear it, and&#xD;
come rushing up.   " How funny it is that&#xD;
you  should  have  guessed  it right the&#xD;
very first pop ! Yes, sir ! it is money-mon-&#xD;
ey that I have earned by the sweat of my&#xD;
brow and the manipulation of pasteboard,&#xD;
during the last ten years. All in gold, too !&#xD;
all sorts-beautiful Spanish doubloons, and&#xD;
American eagles, and French lonoys, and En-&#xD;
glish sovs ! Splendid ! I didn't want to&#xD;
put them in no bank. No indeed. There&#xD;
ain't one of them that won't break before the&#xD;
year's out.  No, sir! none of vour rotten&#xD;
shinplasters for me ! All gold ! Now don't&#xD;
you consider yourself a most all-fired lucky&#xD;
coon, sir."&#xD;
" Why ?" I asked.&#xD;
" Because you are the first man who sleeps&#xD;
in this room-and therefore all that money is&#xD;
yours !"&#xD;
I confess to a sort of warming up in the&#xD;
region of the heart and pocket at this an-&#xD;
nouncement. What I, poor Pete Barclay, with&#xD;
fifteen dollars a week salary, the possessor of&#xD;
the large winnings of ten years, belonging to a&#xD;
successful " sport!" It took away my breath.&#xD;
" Get up and look at it," said Major Jim.&#xD;
I drew on some of my clothing, got out of&#xD;
lied, lighted a candle, and walked over to&#xD;
the fireplace. There was the stdne just as&#xD;
be had said, cracked through. The fissure&#xD;
was wide enough for me to insert my finger.&#xD;
I probed about curiously. There was earth&#xD;
beneath. I wondered at that, as this was&#xD;
not a room on the ground floor ; but then I&#xD;
remembered that the wharf ended in a steep&#xD;
hill, and that all the houses on what we -of'&#xD;
New Orleans call the levee, were backed&#xD;
by a bank. This explained the earthwork.&#xD;
 You see,' said Major Jim, taking the&#xD;
candle from my hand and spilling the sperm&#xD;
about, " I found myself in possession of a&#xD;
lot of gold, and I didn't want-to bank it. I&#xD;
didn't think it would be safe in bank. This&#xD;
room was mine. Nobody else ever occu-&#xD;
pied it. Korley wouldn't have let it to you&#xD;
to-night if I hadn't been dead." (And lie&#xD;
looked up at ine with his stony eyes steadily,&#xD;
and with perfect composure). "'So I bought&#xD;
an earthern crock, and I put my gold in it,&#xD;
and I buried it under this hearthstone. Every&#xD;
' pull' I made on the river, I'd come up here,&#xD;
lift up the stone, and cuddle away my new&#xD;
beauties with the iest until it is now almost&#xD;
chock-full. Just think of' it! Chock full of&#xD;
gold. And all yours ! Ain't you a [ucky&#xD;
coonP"&#xD;
&#xD;
I felt that I was lucky. My horror of&#xD;
this dreadful dead Major ,Iim had vanished,&#xD;
and the innate cupidity which burns in every&#xD;
man's breast had become thoroughly i'arouseil&#xD;
to the extinction of every other feeliin.&#xD;
" How shall I get the stone up ? " Iasked,&#xD;
breathlessly.&#xD;
IInmvenm't you got a pocket-knife ? " he&#xD;
responded, almost as excited as myself.&#xD;
I've got a pen-knife."&#xD;
Perhaps that wil do; if the blades are&#xD;
strong, I'mn sure it-will."&#xD;
I put my hand in my pocket and drew out&#xD;
the knife.&#xD;
" Open several of the blades together, for&#xD;
strength," he said.&#xD;
I opened all the blades which hinged tho&#xD;
same way, and, inserting them  under the&#xD;
stone as a wedge, gave it as powerful a&#xD;
lift" as I could.&#xD;
The blades snapped off like hits of thread&#xD;
leaving the handle in my hand, Quick as&#xD;
thought I tried the other side, only to repeat&#xD;
the experience. Disgusted, I flung t hel knil'&#xD;
from me and began wildly clutching at tie&#xD;
stone with my fingers, lacerating them paini-&#xD;
fully in the effort to lift the stone.&#xD;
" I always used a great s strong screw-&#xD;
(Iriver, which answered the purpose splen-&#xD;
dilly. I can't think where I put it. Y ou&#xD;

Major .Jim laid his lank finger on his&#xD;
bloodless lip, and whispered hoarsely :&#xD;
" Go see who's there ! "&#xD;
I walked to the door, and opened it sufli-&#xD;
ciently to see that it was the house porter,&#xD;
cone to wake me according to my orders.&#xD;
'' It's past halfpast six, sir; in fiart, nearly&#xD;

And I pushed the door to, and holteil it&#xD;

I rushed to the fire-place, to speak to&#xD;

I groaned aloud and dropped into a chair.&#xD;
Why had I not stayed? Why had I been&#xD;
such an idiot? I could have killed myself.&#xD;
Should I tell Korley? No ; he, too, had let&#xD;
the treasure slip through his fingers. It was&#xD;
more merciful to let him remain in igino-&#xD;
rance.&#xD;
"So, as the stone was too badly broken to&#xD;
be put back, I had a new one laid in."&#xD;
I could not speak to him.&#xD;
That afternoon, I went on board the Au-&#xD;
tocrat, bound for New Orleans. Korley was&#xD;
with tme to the last.&#xD;
" Did I tell you the Coroner came that&#xD;
morning, almost immediately after you left,&#xD;
and gave a verdict of "accidental drowning."&#xD;
Then we buried him. Poor fellow! We had&#xD;
to sell that diamond pin he wore, to pay his&#xD;
funeral expenses. He had no money, not a&#xD;
cent, and yet people used to say he cheated&#xD;
at eards-dern 'mi all !&#xD;
XVWe're ofi!"&#xD;
A simultaneous shout from myriads of&#xD;
voices-young and old folks, rich and poor&#xD;
folks, white and colored folks,-a creaking of&#xD;
machinery, a prolonged whistle from a steam-&#xD;
boiler's pipe, and the huge boat moves slow-&#xD;
ly away from the shore !&#xD;
Korley springs off on to the wharf, waving&#xD;
his handkerchief in token of adieu, and the&#xD;
last I see of him he is standing in'the door-&#xD;
way of the "River Queen Hotel."&#xD;
I can give no elucidation of the events I&#xD;
have related. They happened just as I have&#xD;
told them. If it was a dream it was a very&#xD;
vivid one; and if it was a vision, wasn't I&#xD;
an idiot, a donkey, not-to take advantage of&#xD;
it?&#xD;
I have thought over it now pretty continu-&#xD;
ously for twenty years. If any of my read-&#xD;

to it they have my full consent to do so.&#xD;
Twenty years is a long time, isn't it? I am&#xD;

SOMEWHAT       RELATIONAL.&#xD;
In other words, My Cousin Frank," said&#xD;
I. " A relation in two senses of the word."&#xD;
" ow so? '" asked John.&#xD;
Why if he is-' my cousin Frank,' he is a&#xD;

JOHN MORRIS' MONEY.&#xD;
&#xD;
-411&#xD;
y f'&#xD;
{I fi&#xD;
&#xD;
acted a midnight crime ?-that at this point&#xD;
a troublesome heir to property was pushed&#xD;
from his hold, and then (after a few minutes'&#xD;
lapse of time) a loud cry of " man overboard&#xD;
-my eldest brother overboard "-was raised ?&#xD;
Who knows of such things?  Who cares to&#xD;
'hear them ? What good could we do if even&#xD;
w'e did know and hear?  No; let it all pass.&#xD;
Let the Everton family die of starvation in&#xD;
the German village if such is their destiny,&#xD;
while I run riot in their princely halls if such&#xD;
is mine.&#xD;
But I am not a man to run riot; every-&#xD;
thing in my nature rebels against that ex-&#xD;
pression and against its enactment. Not&#xD;
that I am an invalid; but in my youth I was&#xD;
always delicate, and now in my manhood,&#xD;
little as I care to own it to myself, I am not&#xD;
strong. 'Tis true every person I know (ex-&#xD;
cept one) extols my face, my figure, swears&#xD;
I am a very Hercules for strength, a very&#xD;
Apollo for grace ; but, thank - Heaven, my&#xD;
looking-glass is no flatterer (caring little and&#xD;
knowing less whether the image it reflects is&#xD;
that of a rich or a poor man), and it tells me&#xD;
my cheek is sallow, my eye lustreless, and1&#xD;
my form thin and emaciated. My physicians&#xD;
have often recommended a life residence in&#xD;
the more genial climes of Europe, or on our&#xD;
own far Southern coast.; but I cannot go.&#xD;
Perhaps as the story progresses the secret of&#xD;
this will divulge itself.&#xD;
I said above that my cousin Frank and my-&#xD;
self presented the two extremes of man-&#xD;
nature. All that cringing sycophants said of&#xD;
me was true of him-tall, manly, athletic;&#xD;
" an eye like Mars, to threaten and com-&#xD;
mand, Hyperion curls "-all the graces that&#xD;
poets and young girls dream of were the&#xD;
birthright of Frank Harley. We formed a&#xD;
striking contrast as we trod together the&#xD;
smooth gravel walks of Everton, or, mount-&#xD;
ed on English thoroughbreds, scoured the&#xD;
woods surrounding. He, straight as an In-&#xD;
dian, elastic as a' gazelle, soft-eyed and&#xD;
ruddy-complexioned as a girl. I, round-&#xD;
shouldered, careworn, melancholy, though&#xD;
two years the junior of the dashing fellow&#xD;
who was my almost constant companion.&#xD;
And yet such is the ingratitude of mortals,&#xD;
to hear his story you would think I was the&#xD;
lucky one, andlhe the poor, wretched miser-&#xD;
able who felt that a great wrong had been&#xD;
(lone him in bringing him into the world, and&#xD;
numberless frightful acts of injustice com-&#xD;
mitted since that interesting period. I can&#xD;
hear his complaint now; it always ran:&#xD;
" Devilish unlucky dog I am; not a penny&#xD;
of my own in the world, while you-thousanms&#xD;
upon thousands." Faugh ! money, money,&#xD;
nothing but money; the very sound of the&#xD;
word nauseated me.&#xD;
Frank Harley's father and mine were two&#xD;
biothiers, belonging to a family whichi boast-&#xD;
ed, even on this democratic soil, of being&#xD;
purely aristocratic ; their aiicestors belonged&#xD;
to that select few of English nobles who set-.&#xD;
&#xD;
tied here and possessed princely domains-&#xD;
whole duchies and principalities of grounds&#xD;
-but who fled back to England when our&#xD;
Revolution broke out. Some member, how-&#xD;
ever, remained here, and this was our pro-&#xD;
genitor, who when he died left something&#xD;
more tangible than his name to his posterity.&#xD;
Thus Frank's father and mine were both rich&#xD;
men at the outset-of life; but before long my&#xD;
father had made himself thrice richer than&#xD;
when he started, and Frank's father had wasted&#xD;
his patrimony till actual poverty stared him and&#xD;
his young wife in the face.. Then a great ex-&#xD;
pediency was thought of-the babe about to&#xD;
visit this mundane sphere, and who now&#xD;
complained so bitterly of his ever having&#xD;
been called upon to - make that entrance,&#xD;
should be named, whether girl or boy, after&#xD;
the bachelor uncle, Francis Harley, who&#xD;
would, of course, in gratitude for said con-&#xD;
descension, immediately constitute the as-&#xD;
yet-unborn member of the family his heir or,&#xD;
heiress. But two months after the arrival of&#xD;
the little savior of the fortunes of his father's&#xD;
house the bachelor uncle became a bachelor&#xD;
no longer, and, in course of time. in answer&#xD;
to Heaven's (all, and in direct antagonism to&#xD;
my uncle's fervent prayers, I came, and&#xD;
now, at the age of twenty-eight, stood be-&#xD;
reft of all relations in the world except&#xD;
Frank, possessed of my father and mother's&#xD;
combined fortunes, of a weak constitution,&#xD;
and the paternal name of Francis Harley.&#xD;
My cousin was, I believe, christened this,&#xD;
too; but it would have seemed as ludicrous&#xD;
to call him Francisas it would to call me&#xD;
Frank. He was frank, gay, dashing, bril-&#xD;
liant. I was Francis-cold, melancholy and&#xD;
ill-favored. I must not forget the other differ-&#xD;
ence between us, which always formed the&#xD;
staple of Frank's conversation when we were&#xD;
quite alone and not likely to be overheard. I'&#xD;
was rich. le was poor. We lived together,&#xD;
and had done so for years, he consenting to&#xD;
this arrangement because of no reason on&#xD;
earth but of my being "tke deucedest nicest&#xD;
fellow going," and I falling in with it because&#xD;
it suited my fancy to have something that I&#xD;
could claim kindred with near inc in solitude&#xD;
or pleasure. Sometimes I grew vastly tired&#xD;
of him, and often have been on the point of.&#xD;
making a different arrangement; but as often&#xD;
have gazed into his face and seen the look of&#xD;
his father there, which brought mine back to&#xD;
memory, and then I said no word of my plan&#xD;
in regard to separation.&#xD;
" Now, isn't it slow?" reiterated Frank,&#xD;
throwing himself at full length on a damask-&#xD;
satin divan, and kicking the sofa cushion out&#xD;
into space. I picked it up from the floor and&#xD;
brushed off the dust which his foot had left&#xD;
there. It was of no great value, a worsted&#xD;
thing, made by some woman's hand; but I&#xD;
placed it cairefuilly on a chair. Then I an.-&#xD;
swered him:&#xD;
a' Why, Frank, I see nothing ' slow' about&#xD;
it. We have horses, carriages, boating, fish.'&#xD;
&#xD;
45&#xD;
&#xD;
ing; later we shall have gunning, long&#xD;
walks, all the new books to read, all the&#xD;
prominent New York jouf-nals and periodicals&#xD;
to devour, a luxurious house to live im, and&#xD;
magnificent grounds to surround us."&#xD;
" Yes, but we don't see a single body from&#xD;
morning till night: we don't know a human&#xD;
soul within fifty miles."&#xD;
To this argument of bodies and souls I&#xD;
could but remain silent, having no proof to&#xD;
the contrary to adduce.&#xD;
" Why don't we go to some of the fashion-&#xD;
able watering places?"&#xD;
le knew well enough why we did not. I&#xD;
had left the city for health, and I did not&#xD;
think it very probable that scarce commodity&#xD;
was to be found in one of the watering pla-&#xD;
ces, where so much stronger liquid than wa-&#xD;
ter is drunk-especially under the guidance&#xD;
of my friend Frank.&#xD;
The house here is taken for six months,"&#xD;
I said evasively.&#xD;
That's nothing," he answered. True, it&#xD;
was nothing to him. " We are forced to pay&#xD;
for it for that length of time," said he, using&#xD;
the first person plural, with delightful cool-&#xD;
ness; "'.but, by Jove ! we are not forced to&#xD;
live in it."&#xD;
True, agaim; but I still held out for my&#xD;
present place of sojourn. .He harped at the&#xD;
different watering places with unceasing vig-&#xD;
or, however, until at length I said, impa-&#xD;
tiently:-.&#xD;
Go there alone, since Everton- is so un-&#xD;
pleasant to you."&#xD;
A hot blush, part of anger and part huml-&#xD;
iation, suffused his handsome features. How&#xD;
could he go to .those expensive places with-&#xD;
out me ? My conscience smote me for my&#xD;
hastiness, aind I at once said:&#xD;
" Well, Frank, give the orders to the&#xD;
servants. We will start next Monday."&#xD;
That was Friday, and a chile1 who longs&#xD;
impatiently for a new toy could not have&#xD;
pined with more eagerness than Frank did&#xD;
for the arrival of the day of our departure.&#xD;
It came at last, however, as everything does&#xD;
in this world--joy, pain, health, sickness,&#xD;
death-and, like all these, fell short of the&#xD;
expectation. I felt that in leaving Everton&#xD;
I was leaving quiet, rest'of mind, tranquility&#xD;
of heart -, and that, in seeking the gay haunts&#xD;
of pleasure's votaries, I was rushing onward&#xD;
to misery, anguish and despair. Nay, smile&#xD;
not at the thought. A sick man who lives&#xD;
within himself sees the kaleidoscope of hu-&#xD;
man life clad in far less brilliant hues than he&#xD;
for whom woman's heart yearns and her eyes&#xD;
overflow. What was woman's heart to mme ?&#xD;
What did I know of that incomprehensible&#xD;
piece of mechanism?&#xD;
Frank had no such misgivings as myself.&#xD;
If he had been on the direct road to Canaan,&#xD;
lie could not have looked more serenely hap-&#xD;
py than lie did when comfortably ensconced&#xD;
in the railway car which was steaming on to&#xD;
Saratoga. IIe had provided himself with&#xD;
&#xD;
numberless elegancies for tih  t rip-lilt&#xD;
comforts of which I was utterly destitute-&#xD;
having a marvellously fine light gray silk&#xD;
coat, to protect his under one from dust, a&#xD;
jaunty hat, which became him   much, and&#xD;
carrying in his hand a bag containing, I af-&#xD;
terwards discovered, as many nec'essaries of&#xD;
life in the shape of knives, forks, brandy&#xD;
flasks, &amp;amp;c., as if Saratoga had been a dist ant&#xD;
wilderness and we were going to founnd a&#xD;
colony there. Travellers spoke to us, and&#xD;
paid nmh (deference to Fraik, leaving me&#xD;
and my thoughts to keep each other con-&#xD;
panv.&#xD;
"Laura Asheton will be there," said Frank,&#xD;
carelessly gazing out of the window after a&#xD;
way traveller, with whom he had been carrv-&#xD;
ing on an interesting discussion on the rela-&#xD;
tive beauties of English and American girls.&#xD;
Where ? " said I, all the blod in my&#xD;
heart rushing up to my face, and then desert-&#xD;
ing it, leaving me pale and icy cold.&#xD;
" At Saratoga, to be sure," answered my&#xD;
cousin, "' Everybody will be there ; aren't you&#xD;
glad you came?"&#xD;
Glad !   1 was   intoxicated  with joy;&#xD;
mad with delight. She was to be there--I&#xD;
should see her.&#xD;
how did you know this, Frank ? " I&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
I got a letter from hem' aunt this morn-&#xD;
ing, and she mentioned it."&#xD;
Strange that Mrs. Warner should write to&#xD;
my ('ousiln.&#xD;
Frank," said I again, just as le was&#xD;
composing himself to sluimber, " are you&#xD;
sure that letter was for von? "&#xD;
" Here it is-perhaps it was written to&#xD;
you. On the whole, I think it was, for there&#xD;
is an allusion to money in it. .Nobody ever&#xD;
alludes to money to Ie, as I have none to&#xD;
allude to.&#xD;
le handed me the letter, which was ad-&#xD;
dressed to " F. Harley, Esq." It was but&#xD;
natural that Frank should open it, and vet&#xD;
his having done so angered moe. It eontain-&#xD;
el but a few words, saving that Laura had&#xD;
been recommended to drink the Saratoga&#xD;
water, and asking me privately (of course&#xD;
without Laura's knowledge) to advance her&#xD;
quarterly income.&#xD;
My father had been Lauri'a's guardian at&#xD;
one period, and had invested hem' monev in&#xD;
some railway stocks, which paid a very hand-&#xD;
some percentage ; but for umany years now&#xD;
the railway had ceased to exist, and ah muon-&#xD;
cys which had been invested therein were&#xD;
among the things of the dead. But for all&#xD;
that I had kept on paving the amount she&#xD;
had been in the habit of receiving, often ad-&#xD;
ding to it, under pretence that the road was&#xD;
doing better. She thanked me occasionally&#xD;
for the interest I took in her affairs, but of&#xD;
course suspected nothing further. I lay no&#xD;
claim to the title of' generous for this-my&#xD;
feeling for her was of a different staimpj. I&#xD;
would have beggared moyse'lf for hem'. And&#xD;

JOlIN MORRIS' MONEY.&#xD;

JOHN MORRIS' MONEY.              47&#xD;
&#xD;
46                         JunLNir      t1&#xD;
now the secret which prevented my going&#xD;
South or to Europe is out-not such a very&#xD;
mysterious one after all. I was in love with&#xD;
Laura Asbeton. I could not leave the coun-&#xD;
try she was in.&#xD;
It was night when we arrived at Saratoga,&#xD;
and found our way to one of those wretched&#xD;
caravans-ries yclept a hotel. I toiled pain-&#xD;
fully up to the topmost story of the house, to&#xD;
reach tIe only room which was still vacant,&#xD;
leaving Frank to ingeribe our names on that&#xD;
ponderous calendar of inrtal (few immortal)&#xD;
cognomens, the register hook.&#xD;
The next day I made researches for Laura&#xD;
and her aunt, but found they had riot arrived.&#xD;
My next duty was to send Mrs. Warner a&#xD;
draft for twice the sum she had requested.&#xD;
This done, I wended- my way toward the ho-&#xD;
tel. There I found Frank conning the pages&#xD;
of a pigmy newspaper with great and evi-&#xD;
lent interest. At last a smile of self satis-&#xD;
faction broke forth, and with a low laugh he&#xD;
exclaimed:&#xD;
"xThere it is; look at it, Francis."&#xD;
It was nothing more or less than the an-&#xD;
nouncement of the arrival~ of F. Harley, Esq.,&#xD;
under the head of h distinguished visitors."&#xD;
" Did yon ask them to put your name&#xD;
there. Frank?" I asked.&#xD;
tFMy name ! " ie ejaculated. " What do&#xD;
they care for my name? I'm not rich, am I?&#xD;
A rose by any other name would smell as&#xD;
sweet;' but Frank Harley, were he suddenly&#xD;
dubbed Rothschild, would occupy a far did&#xD;
ferent status in the financial and social world&#xD;
to the one in which cruel fortune has now&#xD;
placed the individual.in question."&#xD;
" What interest can it be to hy one at&#xD;
Saratoga or omt of it to knew that I am&#xD;
here? " I said sullenly.&#xD;
"The interest of the public is a newspa-&#xD;
per's capital," he answered.  "My being&#xD;
here is of interest to no one."&#xD;
At this moment we were interrupted by&#xD;
the entrance of the clerk, who came rushing&#xD;
toward us, and, with great volubility and no&#xD;
little condescension, informed us that the&#xD;
" Ambassador s-et of rooms on the fi'st&#xD;
floor" would be at our disposal the next day,&#xD;
as the ministerial party now occupying them&#xD;
were to leave by the early morning train.&#xD;
"Very well," said my cousin, waving off&#xD;
the officious personage with a gesture worthy&#xD;
an emperor.  " Have them ready as soon as&#xD;
possible, and then send up some porters to&#xD;
assist our valet to move our trunks."&#xD;
The official retired somewhat abashed,&#xD;
but, on the whole, serenely happy. He wa&#xD;
a pleasant man, looking as if he had beer&#xD;
first well scrubbed with a scrubbing brush&#xD;
and then suddenly immersed in large and&#xD;
snowy vestments of the material known as&#xD;
"duck." In this state of spotless purity ir&#xD;
regard to clothes he remained during th&#xD;
whole period of our stay. .&#xD;
"Did yous bespeak that suit of rooms&#xD;
&#xD;
" Yes, to be sure. Who ever heard of F.&#xD;
Harley, Esq., being stewed alive in a box&#xD;
of a room on the fifth story ? Now these&#xD;
apartments we shall have to-morrow are&#xD;
something like--they are grand, noble--&#xD;
they're dear, to be sure, very dear; but&#xD;
that does not matter. For see the advanta-&#xD;
ges. We can entertain in these rooms-&#xD;
there are some professional singers here now&#xD;
-for a mere trifle we could give a splendid&#xD;
musical soirie."&#xD;
" When you give that, Frank," I said,&#xD;
smiling, " please don't invite me."&#xD;
"What a deuced low spirited, uncomfort-&#xD;
able sort of a misanthrope you are, Francis,"&#xD;
he exclaimed, petulantly.&#xD;
Though it was scarcely fair in him to make&#xD;
this rebuke, J felt what he said was true. I&#xD;
was fast becoming(hypochondriacal. Well,&#xD;
that was my fate ; but was it not a huge&#xD;
piece of selfishness in me to trammel this&#xD;
joyous, frivolous spirit which restlessly flut-&#xD;
tered its wings against the iron-bound cage&#xD;
in which destiny had placed it ?&#xD;
" Well, Frank," I said, "'don'tlet me in-&#xD;
terfere with your plans for enjoyment. Be&#xD;
as gay as you can while you can. If I feel&#xD;
like it I will drop in at your festivals occa-&#xD;
sionally."  So saying, I filled up a check for&#xD;
an adequate sum, and, after signing, handed&#xD;
it to him. He was all smiles, all thanks, all&#xD;
praise ; pleasant words to hear; but as often&#xD;
before it had (lone, the sound of the voice&#xD;
seemed to me false and hollow. The bright&#xD;
eve wasprendered brighter still; but it struck&#xD;
rue that the increased brilliancy came from,&#xD;
the greed which the money awakened, not&#xD;
from gratitude which the act called forth.&#xD;
After. he had left me I cursed myself for a&#xD;
mean-spirited, narrow-minded, suspicious&#xD;
nature, and resolved to harbor no more such&#xD;
ideas about Frank.      N&#xD;
Laura and her aunt arrived the next day,&#xD;
and alighted at the hotel where we were&#xD;
stopping. I met her in the vast space they&#xD;
call the "ladies' parlor," whither I had flit-&#xD;
ted, hoping to see her numberless times dur-&#xD;
ing the day. She came at length, however,&#xD;
accompanied by her aunt, in response to the&#xD;
card I had sent up to them. I watched her as&#xD;
she walked across the long room, and noticed&#xD;
that she was blushing, deeply enhancing her&#xD;
beauty thereby, and that she glanced ner-&#xD;
vously at every gentleman she passed, look-&#xD;
ing for him who had summoned her. Heav-&#xD;
ens! could so much emotion be caused by&#xD;
the knowledge that she was soon to meet&#xD;
s me?   My heart bounded with joy. She&#xD;
Sassed me ; for I sat half hidden by _a win-&#xD;
low curtain. As she did so I pronounced&#xD;
I her name. She started and turned, and her&#xD;
look of blushing happiness was changed for&#xD;
oneof disappointment.&#xD;
on'Why Fancis, is it you ?" she said care-&#xD;
lessly " I thought it was Frank's card."&#xD;
,I said nothing.&#xD;
,"aYou ought to have some distinguishing&#xD;
&#xD;
mark on.your cards, so that one might kno&#xD;
whc   itis that calls.".&#xD;
Was this the greeting she gave me afte&#xD;
three months absence? Was this the en&#xD;
counter which I had longed for, yet shruiil&#xD;
from for very fear of her too great powe&#xD;
over me?&#xD;
1 don'tt know what we could have put o&#xD;
our cards," I answered, in a tone as careles&#xD;
as her own.&#xD;
.Whynot senior and junior ? " she asked&#xD;
laughingly.   Oh no, that would never do:&#xD;
people might think that Frank was your&#xD;
You forget that lie is my senior, Laura.'&#xD;
True. She had forgotten that.&#xD;
.You ought to send up your cartes de(&#xD;
visite when you call," said Mrs. Warner.&#xD;
A hot flush suffused my features at this&#xD;
suggestion. The difference in the individu&#xD;
als rendered even mistaking the photograph&#xD;
Sof one forthe likeness of the other an utter&#xD;
impossibility. Perhaps I was morbidly sen-&#xD;
sitive on the subject of this great disparity&#xD;
in personal advantages between my cousin&#xD;
and myself; but it never troubled me except&#xD;
when I thought of Laura.&#xD;
By the by, where is Frank? " she in-&#xD;
quired.&#xD;
Driving, I believe. I have not seen him&#xD;
this morning."&#xD;
Will he soon be back ? "&#xD;
I suppose so."&#xD;
At this juncture Mrs. Warner took occa-&#xD;
sion to thank me for the promptitude with&#xD;
which I had attended to " that little matter&#xD;
of business; " and thus, after the interchange&#xD;
of a few common-places, ended my first in-&#xD;
terview at Saratoga with Laura Asheton.&#xD;
Perhaps I ought to explain how we became&#xD;
so intimate as to drop the titles of " Mr."&#xD;
and'"Miss" and call each other by the&#xD;
Christian  name.  Frank and I had'lived&#xD;
with Mrs. Warner for several years during&#xD;
our youth. Frank was an orphan, I mother-&#xD;
less, and my father placed us under the&#xD;
charge of this good lady, than whom none&#xD;
better fitted to have care of the moral cul-&#xD;
ture of two growing boys. Our intellectual&#xD;
requrmernents were more than satisfied by&#xD;
competent teachers, who give us lessons at&#xD;
the house. My father was always prejudiced&#xD;
against boarding schools, and my health was&#xD;
certainly fostered with more care by Mrs.&#xD;
Warner than it would have been by any&#xD;
matron of an establishment of the "Dothe-&#xD;
boys Hall " order. Frank was educated by&#xD;
my father in the same manner as myself. I&#xD;
have often wondered why my father never&#xD;
left him any money ii his will ; but to this&#xD;
lay I can remember his telling Frank, and&#xD;
rie too, for that matter, that the former was&#xD;
an ungrateful, worthless fellow, whose only&#xD;
chance for heconming a solid, steady man was&#xD;
being thrown omit into the world and left to&#xD;
struggle for himself." This he had never&#xD;
done since my accession to the fortune. and&#xD;
&#xD;
w  it was one of my pet plans to marry Frank&#xD;
to the girl he loved, however poor or lowly&#xD;
r she might be, and then on his wedding day&#xD;
- hand him a check for as many thousand (101-&#xD;
k lars as he had years, providing he married&#xD;
r before he was fifty (which there was every&#xD;
probability of his doing). - I (cold do' this&#xD;
n without seriously interfering with my own&#xD;
s yearly income. It was in this manner that&#xD;
we three children, then called each other&#xD;
Frank, Francis and Laura, and to this day&#xD;
we have adopted no other mode.&#xD;
r I don't know whether Laura Asheton was&#xD;
considered a beauty by anybody but myself.&#xD;
She was a tender-eyed, pink-checked, amiable&#xD;
looking girl, elegant im her dress a1d figure,&#xD;
lmt laying no claims to the leseripitiye ad-&#xD;
jective " fist," being as directly opposite to&#xD;
" rapid " in every particular as well might&#xD;
- be. I heard a ghastly pale lady say once to&#xD;
her that if she were dressed in costume&#xD;
Laura would look only like a peasant girl,&#xD;
and nothing niore, wih Ithose rcd cheeks.&#xD;
,Ahi, lady ! if Arcadia's peasants were like&#xD;
Laura, how fain would I leave the at uos-&#xD;
phere of American bon ton to fhy to those&#xD;
leafy bowers and dream away my lif-&#xD;
Frank returned from   his drive in due&#xD;
course of time, and, on entering the roolmi&#xD;
made a vigorous attack, in which the safety&#xD;
of the bell-pull was greatly comiiproiied.&#xD;
" Bring me up a bottle of Veive (liquot,"&#xD;
said my cousin to the waiter who answered&#xD;
the summons ; " the real thing -1do you&#xD;
hear? - no trash    l ie off 1l' bgeie.&#xD;
Clear onut, will you&#xD;
This to the lhibernian who was wasting;&#xD;
precious moments in the inspection of the&#xD;
airanigemeits of our drawing-room, which&#xD;
had been enlivened a little by the introduc-&#xD;
tion of some few objes d'art, bronzes, etc.&#xD;
Theatrical slaves, when they fly to do the&#xD;
bidding of the genii who conmnanid them,&#xD;
could not have disappeared faster than the&#xD;
Celt iid on hearing Frank's peremptory order.&#xD;
He flew, and presently the chiamipagne flew&#xD;
all over the cloth of the centre table, much&#xD;
to my annovance ; for I am a neat person&#xD;
naturally anm cannot bear to see destruction&#xD;
of any kind. Wanton carelessness positive-&#xD;
ly pains Me.&#xD;
By Jove, sir," suddenly ejaculated my&#xD;
cousin, after paying his devoirs to the bottle,&#xD;
which I refused to salute, " she's the most&#xD;
gorgeous woniain I ever saw.  ' She's all my&#xD;
famnicy painted her, she's lovely,' etc., etc.&#xD;
Have you seen her ?"&#xD;
Yes," I answered, looking out into the&#xD;
hot, dusty street, at the jaded creatures who&#xD;
came here under pretence of seeking country&#xD;
air, and now pitving. now despising them&#xD;
for their sheeplike pioclivities, in thus herd--&#xD;
ing together in untoward places, because,&#xD;
forsooth, fashion willed it so.&#xD;

48               JOHN MORRIS'' MONEY.&#xD;
&#xD;
" She came into the drawing-room to see&#xD;
me." I answered, quietly. "I sent up my&#xD;
card."&#xD;
A prolonged stare, in which both eves and&#xD;
mouth opened to their fullest extent, then&#xD;
an uncontrollable burst of laughter, were the&#xD;
signs of wonder and mirth with which my&#xD;
cousin greeted this remark.&#xD;
" Well, well, I've always heard that still&#xD;
waters run deep; but to think of a quiet, re-&#xD;
tiring fellow like you having the ' cheek' to&#xD;
send up your card to a woman you don't&#xD;
know. And she came down ! Of course&#xD;
she did ! She'd heard you were one of the&#xD;
richest men in this country."&#xD;
" Woman I don't know-' cheek,' " I re-&#xD;
peated, in no very amiable tone' of voice.&#xD;
"Who are you talking about ? "&#xD;
Who are you talking about?"&#xD;
"About Laura Asheton."&#xD;
" The devil take-that is, I meant to say,&#xD;
I wasn't speaking of Laura Asheton. I was&#xD;
talking of the new arrival who has set every-&#xD;
body on the qui vive-the renowned French&#xD;
lady, Madame de Viron."&#xD;
I listened, but heeded not his wholesale&#xD;
praises of this lady ; she had only been at&#xD;
Saratoga two hours; yet Frank at that mo-&#xD;
ment could have written her biographyif the&#xD;
pigmy newspaper had chosen to ask it of&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"She's a young widow, just twenty-three;&#xD;
was married at some barbarously youthful&#xD;
period to an ancient brick, who considerately&#xD;
departed this life two years ago, leaving her&#xD;
an immense fortune all in her own right.&#xD;
Her mother is travelling with her, and they&#xD;
are visiting this country on a tour of pleas-&#xD;
use, and will return to Paris in November."&#xD;
It was not until this theme was well nigh&#xD;
exhausted (my patience had been long be-&#xD;
fore) that Frank thought of the person who&#xD;
so constantly occupied my reflections.&#xD;
"So Lolly has arrived, has she ? Did you&#xD;
say anything about sitting next them at din-&#xD;
ner?"&#xD;
I frankly confessed that while with them I&#xD;
had never so much as thought of dinner; at&#xD;
which avowal of imbecility Frank gazed at&#xD;
ie with an expression of pity for my weak-&#xD;
ness and sorrow for my incapacity, which was,&#xD;
positively speaking, " And this is the man&#xD;
-I know he was inwardly saying-" who is&#xD;
rich, while I, such a man as I, am poor."&#xD;
"I must see about it then," said he, more&#xD;
scornfully than the heinous circumstance&#xD;
seemed to me to warrant.&#xD;
I accompanied-him down stairs, heard him&#xD;
give the order, saw him fee the waiter, and&#xD;
then we strolled out together fora walk. It&#xD;
was a little before the dinner hour when we&#xD;
returned and repaired to the drawing-room&#xD;
to await the coming of the ladies. Laura&#xD;
and her aunt were among the first to appear.&#xD;
The beautiful blush which I had observed on&#xD;
her face in the morning again suffused her&#xD;
features as her blue eyes fell on Frank.&#xD;
&#xD;
Why, Lolly, how do you do? " said he,&#xD;
gazing over her shoulder at a bevy of ladies&#xD;
-who were entering the room, and- scarcely&#xD;
glancing at my beautiful peri, whose hand&#xD;
he was holding. " So you've come, have&#xD;
you ? I told Francis everybody would be&#xD;
here. Why, bless me, how cold your hand&#xD;
is! You can't be well. System out of or-&#xD;
der, eh? The water will do you-good."&#xD;
So saying he dropped the little hand, and&#xD;
left her to encase it in a tiny glove, as she had -&#xD;
(lone to its mate already. I knew the cause&#xD;
of the cold hand. I knew all the symptoms&#xD;
-contradictory, extraordinary, inexplicable&#xD;
-which the emotion of the heart will awak-&#xD;
en in thxe body. I knew it, and then cursed&#xD;
myself. She loved Frank Harley-it was&#xD;
as plain as day-the boy who had teased her&#xD;
as a child, whom she knew as a man to be&#xD;
fickle and faithless. She now hardly dared&#xD;
to lift her eyelids to him, investing him with.&#xD;
that sanctity which was the reflex of her own&#xD;
pure feeling, and not in any manner a part&#xD;
of the man's nature.&#xD;
By some singular coincidence--perhaps&#xD;
not so mysterious to Frank as to the rest-&#xD;
the new arrival and her mother sat directly&#xD;
opposite us at dinner, and thus I had a good&#xD;
opportunity of scanning the features of the&#xD;
" renowned " French lady. My first im-&#xD;
pression was not altogether a favorable one ;&#xD;
that is, my first impression of her face. Au&#xD;
rested, all was charming. Her dress was a&#xD;
pleasing mixture of grave colors and gay,&#xD;
and of a cut which, though youthful, still&#xD;
partook of a matronly character, suiting thus&#xD;
at once her years (yet few) and her position&#xD;
in life, which was advanced,- as she had been&#xD;
wife, and was now widow, at an age when&#xD;
many of her sex are yet maids. Her figure&#xD;
was full of grace ; but it struck me that the&#xD;
face, which all lauded for its piquancy, many.&#xD;
for its prettiness - which Frank apostro-&#xD;
phized in a rather singular, but perhaps not&#xD;
inappropaiate, phrase, as " deuced lovely "-&#xD;
was more marked by an expression of com-&#xD;
bined boldness and cunning than I could have&#xD;
wished. Still, the more I looked at it the&#xD;
more attractive it became, and before the'&#xD;
dinner was over I agreed with Frank that&#xD;
Madame de Viron was a very fascinating&#xD;
person in appearance.&#xD;
" Fascinating! She's bewildering! hbe-&#xD;
witching ! I say, Francis, did it ever strike&#xD;
you that our friend there on your right, Lol-&#xD;
ly Asheton, is a deucedly insipid girl? "&#xD;
At another time I would have struck him&#xD;
to the earth for such an expression. My first&#xD;
impulse was to do this now ; but then a sec.&#xD;
end thought, quicker than lightning flash,&#xD;
came to me, whispering, " Let him think&#xD;
slightingly of her. When she finds he does&#xD;
not love her perhaps she will transfer her af-&#xD;
feetions to you." I do not say I clutched at&#xD;
this idea eagerly. I have over been too&#xD;
poud to be0 mean, and what meanness could&#xD;
he greater than to underrate a woman you es-&#xD;
&#xD;
teem under such circumstances as these ?  I&#xD;
did not reply to his question, the very sub-&#xD;
ject of our remark causing a diversion by oh-&#xD;
serving that everybody had gone, and as the&#xD;
dinner was over she saw no reason for not&#xD;
falling in with everybody's example. Every-&#xD;
body was gone except the French party op-&#xD;
posite, who sat sipping their wine slowly and&#xD;
sensibly, after the European fashion. The&#xD;
two companions of the lady who had so cap-&#xD;
tivated Frank were her mother, between&#xD;
whom and her daughter there existed not the&#xD;
slightest resemblance, who was called Mad-&#xD;
ame de Monsel, and a short, chubby, slightly&#xD;
oleaginous gentleman. whose name I never&#xD;
caught exactly, but who, like the ladies, re-&#xD;
joiced in the aristocratic prefix of " de."&#xD;
We left them in the dining-room, and,&#xD;
Laura and her aunt accepting a drive with&#xD;
me and Frank, we lost sight of Madame de&#xD;
Viron for-that evening. On the next a hop&#xD;
was to be given at the hotel ; and Frank in-&#xD;
formed me in the morning that " this night&#xD;
or never " he would be introduced to the fair&#xD;
French lady.  I did not ask him how this&#xD;
was to be brought about, and was utterly&#xD;
amazed afterwards to see that he had some-&#xD;
how or other scraped up an acquaintance with&#xD;
the French gentleman, as my cousin left me to&#xD;
discourse with him. After they had- taken&#xD;
" a drink " together and indulged in other&#xD;
friendly procedures, Frank cane up to me&#xD;
and asked me in a low tone if I wanted to&#xD;
use the phaton and horses that morning. I&#xD;
said no, and before the monosyllabic word&#xD;
had well passed my lips Frank was back&#xD;
again at the Frenchman's side, and begging&#xD;
that person to join him in his morning drive.&#xD;
This offer was graciously accepted, and the&#xD;
last I heard of the pair the Frenchman was&#xD;
loudly complimenting Frank on the beauty&#xD;
and good taste of his equipage, assuring&#xD;
him that it was far too stylish an affair for&#xD;
this country, and, to be properly apprecia-&#xD;
ted, should be rolling along the smooth ave-&#xD;
nue of the Champ Elysees. They both pass-&#xD;
ed me without a look or gesture, and I went&#xD;
to seek Laura. I found her, and, accompan-&#xD;
ied by her aunt, we took a stroll through the&#xD;
town. Her manner was, as usual, perfectly&#xD;
kind to me-a mixture of sweetness and&#xD;
friendly familiarity which oppressed me.&#xD;
How gladly would I have exchanged this for&#xD;
the blushing nervousness she displayed' to-&#xD;
wards Frank ! She inquired where he was,&#xD;
and seemed very uncomfortable when I told&#xD;
her who his companion was in the drive.&#xD;
''Frank is rather remiss in his attentions&#xD;
to old friends," said Laura, with unfeigned&#xD;
annoyance.&#xD;
-   Ah, my dear," said her aunt, " I always&#xD;
told you Francis was the kinder of my two&#xD;
boys."&#xD;
I pressed my good friend's hand for thanks,&#xD;
and looked up at Laura to see if she coinci-&#xD;
(led in the sentiment, Alas ! her thoughts&#xD;
were far away from me ; for at that moment&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
Frank came dashing by in the photon, and&#xD;
the Frenchman   directed  his eye-glass to&#xD;
Laura's flushed face in so decided a manner&#xD;
that my very blood boiled at the sight of his&#xD;
now fast-retreating form.&#xD;
"Insolent fellow!" I exclaimed,&#xD;
"Who? Not- our Frank, I hope?"     By&#xD;
all the saints in the calendar, the girl had&#xD;
seen but him, nor even noticed that the&#xD;
Frenchman sat by his side ! Once home, I&#xD;
shut myself in my room, and, engrossed in&#xD;
the reading of a book upon which I forced&#xD;
my mind to dwell, heard naught more of the&#xD;
actors in my drama till long past nightfall,&#xD;
when an unusual hurry and bustle was heard&#xD;
on the staircase, and "sounds of music began&#xD;
to issue from the dancing hall below. I then&#xD;
remembered the hop, and determined to go&#xD;
down-not to join in it, but to gaze at Laura&#xD;
in her ball dress. I knew she would be&#xD;
beautiful, and reason whispered me to shun&#xD;
her on that very account; still I could not&#xD;
resist the temptation, and, after a half hour&#xD;
of indecision, I found myself at the door of&#xD;
the dancing-hall. I settled myself in a seat&#xD;
behind the door, or partly so, and, glancing&#xD;
across the room, beheld Laura sitting with&#xD;
her aunt, and listening with downcast eyes&#xD;
and happy, happy smiles to the platitude of&#xD;
Frank, who stood bending over her and&#xD;
whispering, fairly whispering, in her ear.&#xD;
They made a fine picture thus together, the&#xD;
handsome features of both enhanced by the&#xD;
excitement, and perhaps by the subject they&#xD;
were talking about, and for the first time in&#xD;
my life, for the first time in all the years I&#xD;
had known him, I felt that I hated Frank&#xD;
Harley. Hated him, not with a mean, pitiful&#xD;
spite which would wear itself out, but with&#xD;
the deep, undying hatred of a man who has&#xD;
been attacked and worsted in that which he&#xD;
holds most dear. Yes, there was the sting!&#xD;
I was worsted. If I had felt that he and 1&#xD;
stood on equal grounds, as we did when we&#xD;
were boys, I could have fought the battle&#xD;
bravely, and if vanquished have succumbed;&#xD;
but to feel that he had conquered without&#xD;
even having so much as made an eflort to&#xD;
obtain the prize which now lay quietly with-&#xD;
in his grasp ! Why, why had he the advan-&#xD;
tage of me in every particular? And yet I&#xD;
-no, Laura Asheton was not a imercenary&#xD;
girl-perhaps if she had   been it would&#xD;
have been better for my peace of mind; for I&#xD;
would have loved her less for that defect.&#xD;
My mind was diverted from    the scene&#xD;
which was passing before inc by hearing my&#xD;
name pronounced repeatedly quite close to&#xD;
ine-my name or Frank's, I knew not which.&#xD;
But how did you find out he was so rich,&#xD;
mon cher?" asked the younger French lady&#xD;
of their male companion ; for it was he who&#xD;
had pronounced the name of Iarley.&#xD;
"Everybody says he's worth more than a&#xD;
million of dollars. Dollars ! (10 you under-&#xD;
stand ; not francs."&#xD;
"Ah, mon Die!" exclaimed the lady, with&#xD;

50               JOHN MORRIS' MONEY.&#xD;
&#xD;
a little scream of delighted surprise; " intro-&#xD;
duce him at once, cher ami."&#xD;
This little conversation was carried on in&#xD;
French, and I presume that, even if they&#xD;
saw me, they deemed me far too unlettered&#xD;
to understand their courtly language. My&#xD;
surprise at the disclosure of Frank's sud-&#xD;
den accession to fortune was enhanced- by&#xD;
seeing that gentleman himself approach, and,&#xD;
after introduction by the Frenchman, he be-&#xD;
gan paying the most false, most shallow, most&#xD;
egregious compliments to Madame de Vir-&#xD;
on which it ever ceuld have been    that&#xD;
lady's lot to listen to. Disgusted at his in-&#xD;
sincerity, I left my retreat and went across&#xD;
to Laura. I observed that she refused all&#xD;
invitations to dance now, and I therefore&#xD;
deemed the moment a fit one for a tete-a-tete.&#xD;
"You are-not dancing, Laura ?"  I said,&#xD;
interrogatively.&#xD;
"No," she answered, " I don't feel much&#xD;
like it; but what good genius brings you in&#xD;
such a scene as this, Francis ?"&#xD;
"4The same who I hope will accompany&#xD;
me but of it. Will you go back on the&#xD;
piazza with me, Laura?"&#xD;
She gathered up a large shawl or cloak&#xD;
which was hanging on the chair behind her,&#xD;
and casting it over her shoulders formed an&#xD;
admirable relief of dark blue to the delicate&#xD;
tinting of her face and hair. She- took my&#xD;
arm with perfect freedom, and, when answer-&#xD;
ing my questions, looked into my face with a&#xD;
guileless; indifferent expression, which was&#xD;
greatly in contrast to the trepidation and&#xD;
fluttering she had displayed  when Frank&#xD;
spoke to her.&#xD;
"Laura," I said, walking with her quite&#xD;
out of earshot of others who were engaged&#xD;
in the same pursuit, "1 this is rather an unto-&#xD;
ward place for a serious conversation; yet&#xD;
circumstances which have lately transpired&#xD;
force me, as it were, to have an immediate&#xD;
explanation with you."&#xD;
"Dear me, Francis, what a portentous&#xD;
tone. What has happened to you."&#xD;
"1There has happened to me the greatest&#xD;
misfortune which it has yet been my unhappy&#xD;
lot to sustain."&#xD;
" Oh, Francis ! my dear, dear Francis!&#xD;
bow sorry I am for it! What is it?  What&#xD;
can it be? "&#xD;
She accompanied her endearing words by&#xD;
a look so full of sweetness and sincerity that,&#xD;
coupled with her angelic beauty, I forgot all&#xD;
I had previously seen, and in a moment 'of&#xD;
idiocy fancied that perhaps, after all, she did&#xD;
love me.&#xD;
"'Laura," I exclaimed wildly, ",can you,&#xD;
do you, love me ?"&#xD;
"Love you, Francis? you know I do. If&#xD;
you were my own brother I could not love&#xD;
you better."&#xD;
" But only as a brother, Laura? Only as&#xD;
a brother'?"&#xD;
" Of course, Francis, as nothing else."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Not as a husband, Laura?   Tell me-&#xD;
speak quickly !"  _&#xD;
"No, oh! no, Francis, that could never&#xD;
be'!"&#xD;
" And why not-why ? "&#xD;
" Because I love somebody else. if you&#xD;
must know the truth."&#xD;
And that somebody is-"&#xD;
Frank Harley."&#xD;
A groan burst from my lips. 0, Heaven !&#xD;
must this man stand ever between my best&#xD;
hopes and their fulfilment? If he had rob-&#xD;
bed rue of anything but her-her whom I had&#xD;
loved so long, so wildly.&#xD;
"i Laura," I said, with an effort to be calm,&#xD;
"listen to reason. Do not be insane in this.&#xD;
Frank is not worthy of your love. Oh! I&#xD;
am not pleading for myself now, but for you;&#xD;
your happiness. He does not love you."&#xD;
He does, sir. He swore it to me to-&#xD;
night, there in the ball-room."&#xD;
My head fairly swam  at this evidence of&#xD;
his hypocrisy. 1, who had but now listened&#xD;
to his avowals to Madame de Viron, was&#xD;
half bewildered at seeing this pure girl so&#xD;
firmly convinced of his love for herself.&#xD;
And he, the man, what did he deserve?&#xD;
Naught but contempt-he was unworthy re-&#xD;
venge.&#xD;
"Oh, Laura, be warned !" I exclaimed;&#xD;
" how I could undeceive you in regard to&#xD;
that man if I chose."&#xD;
" In doing so you would- betray your cous-&#xD;
in's confidence, for which you would meet&#xD;
with his anger and my lack of esteem.&#xD;
Good night, Francis."&#xD;
She left me and joined her aunt, and I&#xD;
rushed up to my room, where I remained a&#xD;
close prisoner for a week. My servant,&#xD;
used to my vagaries; refused admittance to&#xD;
all, even to Frank, above all to Frank, and&#xD;
I had no opportunity of watching his pro-&#xD;
gress. either with L'ura or Madame de Vi-&#xD;
ron ; but I cherished in my heart such a ha-&#xD;
tred for him, for his fickleness, his fi'ivolity,&#xD;
that 1 dreaded to meet him, fearing that, in&#xD;
the excess of my rage. I- would do hirm an&#xD;
injury-him, the only living thing on earth&#xD;
in whose veins coursed kindred blood.&#xD;
Sorry to disturb you, sir; but there are&#xD;
two ladies, standing outside who wish to&#xD;
speak to you," said my servant, in a low&#xD;
tone, fearing to disturbb my reveries.&#xD;
" Who are they, Williams? " I asked.&#xD;
Mrs. Warner and Miss Laura, sir."&#xD;
My first impulse was to start and rush to&#xD;
them ; my next, to falter like a man who&#xD;
had committed some crime which in a mo-&#xD;
ment of weakness ie has confessed, and now&#xD;
stands convicted of.. I managed, however,&#xD;
to open the door; and there saw them dress-&#xD;
ed in travelling costume, evidently on the&#xD;
eve of departure.&#xD;
" We couldn't go -away without wishing&#xD;
you good-bye, Francis," said Mrs. Warner,&#xD;
holding out her hard to me-.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Are you leaving Saratoga?" I asked&#xD;
feebly.&#xD;
" Yes, by the next train ; and if we don't&#xD;
hurry we shan't catch it. Come, now, say&#xD;
good-bye to Laura."&#xD;
All my old love returned with redoubled&#xD;
ardor at sight of her, and with it something&#xD;
of my old strength.&#xD;
May I speak with you for a moment ?&#xD;
I inquired-" only for a moment, but pri-&#xD;
vately ?"&#xD;
" Oh, yes indeed, F'rancis," she answered.&#xD;
I've been so unhappy thinking you were&#xD;
-angry at nre."&#xD;
Great Heaven ! was the girl mad to keep&#xD;
saying such things, which, while meaning&#xD;
nothing, on her part, totally unmanned me?&#xD;
She withdrew with me to the emrnlrasure of a&#xD;
window, and there I asked her blutly, with-&#xD;
out a word of preparation or apology for my&#xD;
brusqueness, whether she still loved Frank.&#xD;
" Yes," she replied, " more than ever."&#xD;
I groundil y teeth in an agony of disap-&#xD;
pointed love ; and yet what else could I cx-&#xD;
pect?&#xD;
" And you think ie loves you ?"&#xD;
" I ascertain of it."&#xD;
"'Laura A.;fbeton, answer me one question&#xD;
more. Are yorn unler air engagement of&#xD;
mra r'riage to my~ (cousirn ?"&#xD;
y Not a positive (r defirite one, but one&#xD;
that is unrder'stood. Fr ank is poor; so am&#xD;
1 - before lie can inrarry he must contrive to&#xD;

Thank God, there xxas this imepedimrenrt in&#xD;
their way. I rebelled in the thought that I,&#xD;
Nu i h one stroke of my pen, coubl make the&#xD;
happiness of both these people-orre of whoi&#xD;
I loved, the other whom I hated. I wouli&#xD;
enrich Frank, I thought, and thus at least&#xD;
obtain hier gratitude. No, no, I could not&#xD;
sell magnainrty even for such a price. I&#xD;
heard irmy cousin's voice on the stairs, and&#xD;
-knew that he was coming to bid them make&#xD;
haste ; so, not caring to niwe(t him, I cast a&#xD;
parting look at Laura and entered my room,&#xD;
shutting themn and hini out. Would that I&#xD;
could hive barred the door to my own weary-&#xD;
ing wearing thoughts as well&#xD;
In the evening, on returning to my apart-&#xD;

tone, " I have been cut to the heart by vour&#xD;

JOHN MORRIS'S MONEY.&#xD;
&#xD;
" I want you to give me this check," I&#xD;
said: "please balance my account and let&#xD;
me have it."&#xD;
The man made no objection to this, and&#xD;
in a short time handed me my bank book,&#xD;
with the cancelled checks.&#xD;
I walked away triumphantly, with the con-&#xD;
victing document in my pocket, vowing in-&#xD;
wardly that through it I would be revenged&#xD;
on Frank Harley. At the ladies' entrance&#xD;
of the hotel I met the mother of Madame&#xD;
de Viron. She was weeping bitterly, and it&#xD;
was some time before I could comprehend&#xD;
the cause of her grief. At last it came out&#xD;
out. Frank Harley and Madame de Viron&#xD;
bad eloped together ! They had last been&#xD;
seen together in a carriage after Frank's re-&#xD;
turn from the bank, and nothing further had&#xD;
transpired in 'egard to them, although many'&#xD;
hours had since elapsed.&#xD;
I was bewildered-perfectly thunderstruck !&#xD;
Had I known that it was the French woman&#xD;
he wanted to marry I would have given him&#xD;
double the money he asked for-aye, triple&#xD;
its amount.&#xD;
" Americans are honorable, are they not?"&#xD;
asked the mother; "6he will marry her?"&#xD;
" I don't doubt it," I replied.&#xD;
While we were yet speaking there arrived&#xD;
a telegram for Madame de Monsel. It was&#xD;
from her daughter, announcing that the mar-&#xD;
riage ceremony had just been performed,&#xD;
and begging forgiveness for their cavalier&#xD;
style of leave taking.&#xD;
Ah, thank Heaven !" sighed the lady,&#xD;
" how glad I am it has turned out so. I as-&#xD;
sure you she loves him truly. It was not his&#xD;
immense wealth that dazzled her-indeed it&#xD;
was not."&#xD;
" I should think not," said a lady near,&#xD;
who knew all about our family, and had&#xD;
known us personally for some time; " she&#xD;
must have been dazzled by very little if that&#xD;
was the case. Why, do you mean to say&#xD;
that your daughter didn't know that Frank&#xD;
Harley hasn't a penny ?"&#xD;
" What!" screamed the old French lady;&#xD;
"do you mean to say that Francis Harley&#xD;
isn't a millionaire ?"&#xD;
"So he is, madame-this Francis Harley&#xD;
-but his scapegrace cousin hasn't a penny&#xD;
to bless himself with."&#xD;
Another shriek from the French lady, salts&#xD;
produced, handkerchiefs in demand, and I&#xD;
left.&#xD;
I had had scarcely time yet to realize all that&#xD;
had passed. There was much bitterness in&#xD;
the news to me; there was sorrow for Laura&#xD;
when she should hear it. But one good&#xD;
cane of the e%.il in it all-the mad, blind&#xD;
fury, the beast-like rage had passed away,&#xD;
and there remained nothing in my heart&#xD;
against him but pity for his fault, pain for his&#xD;
position.  I had vowed to have revenge&#xD;
through the forged check-I would take it&#xD;
now. I enclosed it and another for a like&#xD;
amo' nt in a letter of congratulation to Frank&#xD;
&#xD;
and wishes for his happiness. I knew little&#xD;
then of what I learnt afterwards.&#xD;
By the Lord, Harley !" said my friend&#xD;
Stevenson, whom I met in Broadway shortly&#xD;
after this occurrence, " this- is a jolly dis-&#xD;
graceful affair Frank's got himself into."&#xD;
" What affair?" said I, fearing a repeti-&#xD;
tion of the check business.&#xD;
" What affair?  Why, marrying that in-&#xD;
famous Anette."&#xD;
" Who's Anette ? " I asked, wonderingly-&#xD;
"Why, that French woman, Anita, alias&#xD;
La Precieuse, alias Madame de Viron,&#xD;
alias-&#xD;
".Stop! stop!" said I; "that will do."&#xD;
I wished not to hear the details of her life.&#xD;
I knew by this description that disgrace of'&#xD;
the blackest kind was entailed upon the&#xD;
name.&#xD;
Laura took the news very quietly. She&#xD;
said that her love had been rooted out sur-&#xD;
prisingly, and instantly on hearing of his&#xD;
marriage, leaving no lingering pang to cast&#xD;
a blight on her youthful pathway. I never&#xD;
spoke to her of the check.&#xD;
. I hardly dare tell the rest;. for I have&#xD;
shown myself such a passionate, unthinking,&#xD;
unreasonable man that I fear 'twill jeopar-&#xD;
dize Laura's good taste when I say that by-&#xD;
and-by she bestowed on me the love I had&#xD;
coveted so long. She found out, through no&#xD;
indiscretion of mine, all about her real posi-&#xD;
tion in a financial sense, and gratitude caused&#xD;
her to entertain a warmer feeling than friend-&#xD;
ship for me. She tells me that perhaps this&#xD;
feeling is not that blind, uncertain affection&#xD;
she once entertained for Frank, but 'tis a-&#xD;
flame which will still be burning brightly&#xD;
when the ashes of the other have lain smoul-&#xD;
dering for years.&#xD;
I heard from Frank three months after his&#xD;
arrival in Paris (for they sailed for Europe&#xD;
immediately after their marriage.) Soon&#xD;
discovering what his wife was, he left her,&#xD;
not until she had avowed to-him that it had&#xD;
been a settled plan between herself; the wo-&#xD;
man who personated her mother, and the&#xD;
man, to go to the United States and entrap&#xD;
some rich American into marrying her. The&#xD;
similarity of names between him and myself&#xD;
caused the mistake, and, finding that he was&#xD;
not the millionaire, she was as happy to be&#xD;
rid of him as he was glad to have no more to&#xD;
do with her. With the little that remained&#xD;
of the five thousand dollars I had sent him,&#xD;
he was on the point of sailing for Australia,&#xD;
where a lucrative situation had been offered&#xD;
him. He sent his love to Laura, and trusted&#xD;
that she still bore in mind the pleasant though&#xD;
"limited flirtation " which they had had at&#xD;
Saratoga.&#xD;
We went there againthis year-for all those&#xD;
events occurred in '65. We occupied, as&#xD;
1 had before, the Ambassador's su-el of rooms,&#xD;
andI found again the identical clerk, clad as&#xD;
before in spotless duck, and looking ruddily&#xD;
happy from over thme bosom of his elaborate&#xD;
&#xD;
shirt. His worldly fortune, too, was evident-&#xD;
ly in a more flourishing state than before;&#xD;
for now he wore a diamond cluster ring,&#xD;
where of yore he wore one which we will&#xD;
say was gold, the device ,of which was a&#xD;
large shield whereon might be read the&#xD;
touching announcement that it was given by&#xD;
"P. B. T. to F. A. W."   He jocosely in-&#xD;
sisted on our having the bridal chamber;&#xD;
but Laura shrank from the notice which that&#xD;
would entail. She had her wish in that, as&#xD;
she has in all things, and as she shall have as&#xD;
long as I have an arm to wield in herde-&#xD;
fence, gold to humor her fancies, and life&#xD;
breath to give power and animation to the&#xD;
heart whose every throb beats responsive to&#xD;
her own.&#xD;
VIII.&#xD;
CONTAINING GOOD NEWS FOR ALL, ESPE-&#xD;
CIALLY FOR THE READER, AS IT IS&#xD;
THE END.&#xD;
THE recital of this story had only brought&#xD;
me to the end of the fourth evening of the&#xD;
Christmas week. But-I was not destined to&#xD;
continue my pleasant task. On the fifth day&#xD;
Aunt Julia was taken down with a high fever,&#xD;
and when we sent for Doctor Dos'em, he&#xD;
shook his head gravely, and said there was&#xD;
little to be done. It is but justice to him to&#xD;
say that lie did little enough. John was dis.&#xD;
satisfied with him, and sent for another doc-&#xD;
tor who lived in one of the finest streets in&#xD;
town and charged a dollar a minute for his&#xD;
time. He was more expensive, but not less&#xD;
unsatisfactory than Doctor Dos'emn.&#xD;
"6You see," said he with a choice of lan-&#xD;
guage which sounded anything but choice-&#xD;
to ime at least, "1 Nature, in this female, is&#xD;
about gone under. What can waterier med-&#xD;
iker do agaynst a gin' out nature ? If you're&#xD;
brought this woman to me about twenty-five&#xD;
years ago, when she had a certain amount of&#xD;
vytality in her, you'd seen what I'd a' done&#xD;
then, mighty (quick ! As it is, however, that&#xD;
prescription will calm her nerves-keep down&#xD;
what we call hysterier-and--(five dollars&#xD;
first visit, yes sir)-if she gets worse, you&#xD;
might send for ime, though I think I shall go&#xD;
out of town to-morrow."&#xD;
We tried another and another. Really con-&#xD;
  scientious men these, whose practice lay among&#xD;
people who had nothing to say about any&#xD;
subject but the one of' the illness which had&#xD;
visited a member of their flock, and whose at-&#xD;
tention was perforce centered on the patient.&#xD;
All to no avail,&#xD;
The service-bells ushered ini the Chiristmii&#xD;
morn, and from the little chiurichi across the&#xD;
way we heard thme people singing loud an-&#xD;
&#xD;
thems of joy for the birth of the son of God.&#xD;
We sat by Auntie's bedside--John and I-&#xD;
holding her veinous hands, our two chil-&#xD;
dren  down   stairs kindly cared for by a&#xD;
neighbor from the corner. Our little girl&#xD;
plead staunchly to stay near Aunt Julia. But&#xD;
our irresponsible baby Johnnie, only a few&#xD;
months old, screamed and kicked and was&#xD;
naughty generally ; so both children had to&#xD;
go. At noon, the sun rose gloriously in the&#xD;
heavens, and the bells pealed out gladly&#xD;
again, and the happy-hearted stream of joy-&#xD;
ous humanity emerged from the church and&#xD;
had pleasant thoughts, in which perhaps the&#xD;
knowledge of a turkey at dinner was not&#xD;
the least consoling, especially as phun-pudding&#xD;
generally formed an adjunct, and fiery "snap-&#xD;
dragon " gleamed in advance before juvenile&#xD;
and scholastic eyes.  A  little  equestrian&#xD;
statuette of Godfrey de Bouillon, which John&#xD;
gave me in the first year of our marriage,&#xD;
stood on our mantlepiece, and, though it was&#xD;
so familiar to me that for months I had&#xD;
scarcely turned my eyes toward it, on this&#xD;
day I fixed my gaze upon it steadfastly, and&#xD;
it impressed me strangely.  They tell me&#xD;
(for I have it still) that it is a copy of a life-&#xD;
size one which adorns a public square in Brus-&#xD;
sels. It must be worth crossing the Atlantic&#xD;
to see. The air of fervent piety, valor an(d&#xD;
devotion stamped on these features most adl-&#xD;
mirahly indicate the character of the heroic&#xD;
conqueror of Jerusalemu, who meekly refused&#xD;
to wear a crown of gold in the city where&#xD;
his Redeemer had borne a crown of thorns.&#xD;
Feebler and feebler grows Aunt Julia's&#xD;
pulse. Fainter and   fainter is heard the&#xD;
breathing of our patient.&#xD;
''Oh ! my aunt, can 1 dho nothing for you? "&#xD;
moans my John, burying his head beside&#xD;
hers on tie pillow.&#xD;
Nothing, my boy. It is almost over.&#xD;
Did you not hear what the doctors said ?&#xD;
Nature is tired in mie and must rest. More&#xD;
than that, it must finish.  The works are&#xD;
broken, my children-the clockk must stop."&#xD;
John sobs loud and heart-rendimg. '1hue&#xD;
silent teas course down my cheeks and&#xD;
bedew  her thin, white  hands, while the&#xD;
watch ticks with oinconcerned precision on&#xD;
the table beside her'bed, marking the time&#xD;
for Aunt Julia to die.&#xD;
" God bless you all ! " she whispers. "' Ieo&#xD;
will care for me. lie whose birthday this is,&#xD;
I mean. Kiss the (children for me ; and tell&#xD;
Ambrose and JosephI     forgave them  for&#xD;
turning their backs, and refusing to shelter&#xD;
the poor old woman ; lbmt," and a faint smile&#xD;
played on her lips, '' I think they will be&#xD;
sorry."&#xD;
The moon rose again in its cohl beauty,&#xD;
.throwing once more its mvtcrioums steel-blime&#xD;
rays on the pure snow of theo buse and tree-&#xD;
tops, amd on its hlackemed an :mmmldefiled ] sister&#xD;

John had to be kissed continuously for the everywhere where it would receive the in-&#xD;

consoling kisses. Our little girl who had  much more beside. And finally, one day lie&#xD;

and which she had increased nearly three- such an unromantic figure now, girls, I don't&#xD;

and this fortune-this large fortune, maul-  " Good ! " says John. " Nonsense, Sir&#xD;
