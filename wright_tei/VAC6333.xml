            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>A SENSIBLE and popular lady writer has remarked that want of time <emph>should</emph>
               be no apology for defects of author ship. I heartily agree with that lady's views,
               but when a frontier farmer's wife undertakes to write a book, who has to be lady,
               nurse, laundress, seamstress, cook and dairy-woman by turns, and who attends to all
               these duties, unaided, save by the occasional assistance of an indulgent husband who
               has cares enough of his own, in such a case—and this is not an exaggerated one, as
               many who know me can testify—"want of time"—is a necessary, unavoidable excuse for
               fault of style or discrepancy in composition. Youth and inexperience, also, are other
               excuses, which, though I am not exactly ashamed of, especially the former, must, in
               justice to myself, be hinted at, in this my first literary effort of magnitude.</p>
            <p>My object has been, not to scale the giddy heights of romance, but rather to write a
               book which the world's workers, the stay and strength of out land, shall read with
               benefit. If time-honored customs have been fearlessly assailed, it has not been with
               the object of awakening notice, applause, censure or criticism, but because I
               earnestly believe in the principles advocated, and wish the reader to
                  <emph>think</emph> and <emph>investigate.</emph> Let him, with Bible as his text
               book, Nature as his guide, and Christianity as his principle, search and know for
                  himself<pb n="iv-v (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC6333-00000003"/> before he
               condemns. Skeptics, you who laugh at the Bible, who mock at the mission of the lowly
               Nazarene, who considered the most humble worthy of <emph>His</emph> notice; ye who
               live merely that you may amass riches, eat, drink and die this book is not for you. I
               leave older and wiser heads to parry your studied blows, while I turn, in respect and
               confidence, to the lenient, intelligent, pious and elevated, for encouragement and
               assistance.</p>
            <p>I have taken some liberties in the arrangement of incidents that some may notice, but
               a better wielded pen than mine has asserted that this is the novelist's privilege.
               Hundreds can testify that romance has been almost wholly set aside in the incidents
               of travel over the Plains, and wholly avoided in the incidents of travel over the
               Plains, and wholly avoided in the description of scenery.</p>
            <p>If this book but cast a ray of hope, or gleam of consolation before the pathway of
               the weary; if it should cause one reader to look higher than this earth for solace,
               or open up to him a better way to live and enjoy life, or shall be instrumental in
               causing the sterner, to look more to the welfare of the weakest of the tried and
               suffering of the weaker sex, these pages, penned under every disadvantage, shall not
               have been written in vain.</p>
            <p>To those who have other work to do than spending their time in perusing romance
               without shade of reality, but who delight in the ideal when accompanied by use,
               truth, reform or investigation, this volume is respectfully and affectionately
               dedicated.</p>

               <p>"I TELL you Madam, the law is upon my side, and the less you complain the better
                  for both of us. You need not think that I will give up my just claims upon any
                  one's property. I have a deed of trust in my possession which entitles me to this
                  charming little spot, and you must remove and give me immediate possession of
                  premises."</p>
               <p>The person who spoke these authoritative words, was a man about five feet four
                  inches in height, and very thick set, and broad shouldered. His hair was red and
                  coarse, showing off to no pleasing advantage, a round, flushed face, from which
                  peeped forth a pair of keen, small, grey eyes. His teeth were firmly compressed,
                  and voice raised to an angry key, as those unfeeling sentences were uttered.</p>
               <p>Reader, go back with us in imagination, through the dim vista of time, for a
                  period of nine years from the date of this work—imagine yourself upon the spot,
                  and we will introduce you to the cottage and its inmates.</p>
               <p>'Tis not situated in the suburbs of a pleasant village on the<pb n="8-9"

                  of a dancing, rippling stream in Virginia or Carolina. Nor are we going to
                  describe a cottage and grounds of New England scenery, nor yet a stately farm
                  house of the sunny South, but a regular Illinois scene.</p>
               <p>About half a mile from the banks of the Illinois river, upon one of the beautiful
                  rising grounds so common in many portions of the delightful country, at the time
                  of which we speak, there stood a little cottage. "Twas no choice piece of Gothic
                  architecture, nor yet a straw thatched hovel. 'Twas composed of small, maple logs.
                  The outside had been carefully whitewashed, giving the place a cheerful look.</p>
               <p>There were four front windows, covered with snowy muslin curtains, and ornamented
                  outside in a fantastical manner, with vines of brier-rose, wood-bine, cypress and
                  morning-glories. In front yard might be seen clusters of all kinds of flowers that
                  luxuriate in the balmy air of that genial climate. Purple, red and white roses
                  bloomed in luxurious bunches, and were trained in a manner that a professional
                  gardener would do well to imitate. Lilae bushes were neatly trimmed, and though
                  not in bloom at the season of which we speak, (July,) yet their broad green leaves
                  presented such a pleasing contrast to the varied hues around them, that no one
                  would have thought them out of place.</p>
               <p>Here was the dahlia, geranium, chrysanthemum, piney, and tulip, while pinks,
                  china-astors, marigolds, nasturtions, and violets, bloomed in profusion. On the
                  right side of the cottage stood the orchard, every tree loaded with delicious
                  fruit. To the left, and some distance from the dwelling, was a little barn, every
                  crevice revealing bunches of sweet, newly mown hay. In the rear of the house was
                  the kitchen garden, which was as carefully tended as the front yard, revealing
                  vegetables good enough to tempt the most fastidious appetite.</p>
               <p>The front door opened into a square parlor, with a white mat upon the floor, and a
                  bed in one corner was ornamented with snowy muslin drapery.</p>
               <p>Under a front window was an ottoman, neatly covered with cheap damask. A half
                  dozen chairs, a few choice pictures, and some flower vases teeming with blushing
                  roses, were arranged with taste in this humble, but very comfortable
                  apartment.</p>
               <p>At one corner of the fireplace, was an easy chair in which a lady seated, whom we
                  will introduce to you as Mrs. Goodwin. On the ottoman sat the man who used the
                  language of the beginning of out story.</p>
               <p>He was engaged in an earnest conversation with the lady, upon a subject which
                  appeared to distress her greatly. She was calm, however, an spoke in a mild tone,
                  but her lips trembled as though some uncouquerable emotion struggled for
                  victory.</p>
               <p>"But," said she, "I purchased the land and it is the only home I possess. I bought
                  it with the only means left at my disposal, after my husband's administrators
                  settled our business. I can show a good title to the land."</p>
               <p>"No doubt, madam, no doubt of it, but I have purchased a deed of trust that was
                  given five years ago on the land. The man who sold you the place should have told
                  you that the title was not perfect."</p>
               <p>"I was not to blame about it, Mr. Hammond. Mr. Wells did not tell me that such a
                  title had been given."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mrs. Goodwin, it's useless to talk about it; by the laws of the land the
                  place is mine, and you must remove in one week from to-day. You are poorly able to
                  stand a lawsuit, and I'd advise you to keep out of a scrape. It's pretty hard, but
                  I suppose it's fair," and without saying a kind or even respectful word, he arose,
                  made a stiff bow and departed, slamming the door after him in a way that showed
                  plainly that Mrs. Goodwin's frail cottage would not last long as a habitation for
                  such a man as him.</p>
               <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6333-00000006"/>
               <p>After he left the room, the widow sat perfectly motionless, not knowing what to do
                  or say, until she heard him shut the gate. Then arising from her chair, she walked
                  slowly to the little bedroom, and closing the door, buried her face in a pillow,
                  and burst into tears.</p>
               <p>When introducing our readers to the family, we neglected to speak to Effie, Mrs.
                  Goodwin's daughter, a girl of twelve summers, who sat, pale and almost breathless,
                  on a stool behind her mother while the conversation was going on.</p>
               <p>Effie was a blue eyed, curly haired, rosy checked little sprite, who seemed
                  determined at all times to make the best of everything. Many a ray of bright
                  sunshine had beamed from her laughing eyes, and penetrated deep into the recesses
                  of her widowed mother's heart, causing that mother to thank God daily for
                  confiding to her such a jewel.</p>
               <p>Effie had been sitting as if petrified, not knowing what to do or say during Mr.
                  Hammond's visit, and after his departure she had remained perfectly motionless
                  until the sound of her mother's sobs coming from the bedroom, caused her to go
                  involuntarily to the door. She peeped, not through the keyhole, for there was
                  none, but through a seam in the batten door, and beheld her convulsed with grief
                  in a manner that she had never before witnessed. This continued some minutes. She
                  then appeared to grow calmer, and kneeling upon a strip of carpet beside the bed,
                  she poured forth earnest supplications to the father of widows and orphans, humbly
                  beseeching the Ruler of the Universe to grant her strength for coming trials. Her
                  prayer was ended, and turning with swollen eyes to the bed she kissed, with a
                  mother's earnest tenderness, the blooming cheek of little Willie, who was sleeping
                  sweetly. Willie was a darling child. His high, broad forehead, curling chestnut
                  hair, bright black eyes and rosy lips, and above all other beauties, a sweet
                  disposition, made him the pot of his mother's circle of friends, as he was the joy
                  of the family.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Goodwin turned from gazing upon the lovely features of her sleeping boy, and
                  came from the room with a steady tread. Seating herself again in her chair, she
                  beckoned Effie to her side, clasped her to her bosom, and again the pent up tears
                  gushed forth.</p>
               <p>"Mamma,"said Effie, "couldn't we set up a little store in the village? Herbert can
                  do the business and we can keep house and trim bonnets and we can both embroider
                  neatly. Don't you think we could get along."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Goodwin smiled faintly as her daughter talked, in her sweet winning way, of
                  these things.</p>
               <p>Taking Effie's proffered kiss, she said, "My child, we have no experience in such
                  matters, and we would not know how to manage. Besides, it would take money to set
                  up and we have not got it."</p>
               <p>Here, then, was a dilemma which Effie's childish hope and eagerness could not
                  solve, and having nothing more to say, she remained silent.</p>
               <p>"I feel so badly on poor Herbert's account," said Mrs. Goodwin, and tears started
                  afresh in spite of her efforts to repress them.</p>
               <p>"The poor boy has been so much elated with the success of his summer's work, that
                  I can hardly bear"—here sobs choked her utterance, and she buried her face in her
                  hands and seemed to forget everything else but present poverty.</p>
               <p>"But, mamma, Herbert is young and strong, and it is not his disposition to yield
                  to discouragements. He'll do his best for us," Effie said, throwing her arms
                  around her mother's neck and placing her blooming cheek her careworn face.</p>
               <p>Her cheerful words seemed to have some consoling effect, for Mrs. Goodwin arose,
                  went to the kitchen and began to prepare the evening meal, striving hard to
                  straighten her swollen<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6333-00000007"/> face and look
                  cheerful against Herbert should return from his day's work.</p>
               <p>The table was soon loaded with excellent viands, all procured from the sweet
                  little ten acre farm. The tea was produced from herbs grown in the kitchen garden,
                  and the milk and butter were obtained from the widow's only cow. The two dozen
                  giant maple trees in the four acre pasture, yielded the sugar, while the corn and
                  vegetables were grown in the garden and among the fruit trees. The four was
                  obtained by Herbert's work away from home. Two acres fenced in an oblong square
                  sloping gradually towards the timber, were reserved for meadow.</p>
               <p>They had been waiting for some time after tea was ready before Herbert came home,
                  and Willie, who had awoke in a glee, was beginning to grow sad on account of
                  seeing his mother's anxious face, when the gate was opened, and the sunny
                  countenance of Herbert coming up the walk, showed that their misfortune was
                  unknown to him.</p>
               <p>"Come, Will, give me a kiss, your lips look like double cherries," were his
                  opening words of pleasure.</p>
               <p>When Herbert looked at his mother, he saw traces of recent tears upon her usually
                  cheerful countenance, and changing his mood in an instant, he asked with great
                  apparent concern, the cause of her trouble.</p>
               <p>"We are without a home, my son; a man came here to-day, who has a deed of trust in
                  his possession which calls for out snug little home, and we must leave here in one
                  week from to-day, forever."</p>
               <p>Nothing could have startled him more than did this calm and earnest announcement.
                  He had always been taught the theory that "out of debt is out of danger," and as
                  it was his mother's invariable rule to keep free from incumbrances of this kind,
                  he could not imagine how their little property had become so involved.</p>
               <p>"It was not my doing, Herbert; I have never contracted a debt of one dollar since
                  your father's death. A deed of trust was given on this land some time before I
                  bought it, but I did not know it until to-day."</p>
               <p>Herbert did not reply. He was evidently revolving some important matter in his
                  mind and with his lips firmly compressed and eyes riveted to the floor, he
                  appeared lost in reverie.</p>
               <p>"Herbie, I've got such a nice apple. Mamma told me this morning when the dew was
                  on the clover, that next summer I should have lots of apples on my tree, and I
                  might do just as I pleased with them."</p>
               <p>So spake little Willie, as he came bounding into the room. After receiving
                  Herbert's kiss, he had sprung away and darted through the shrubbery into the
                  orchard, when he found his large red apple on the ground where it had fallen
                  during the day.</p>
               <p>For weeks he had watched this apple with deep interest, and now that the red, ripe
                  fruit was in his hands, his joy seemed to know no bounds.</p>
               <p>"Mamma, what are you crying for? Are you sorry I got the apple?"</p>
               <p>"No, my dear, enjoy it while you may. I feel thankful that my little pet does not
                  feel as we do."</p>
               <p>"But, Mamma, what is the matter? Why, if Herbie doesn't look like crying too!
                  Effie, do tell me," and looking earnestly into this sister's face he tried hard to
                  read her thoughts.</p>
               <p>Effie sat down, took the little fellow in her arms, and told him of their troubles
                  in her own soothing, artless way.</p>
               <p>"Must I give up my apple tree?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, darling, we must give up everything that grows here."</p>
               <p>The child looked bewildered, as if he did not comprehend<pb n="14-15"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000008"/> all that was said, but he understood enough to
                  destroy his habitual gayety.</p>
               <p>"The supper, Mother, the supper! The rascal won't cheat me out of that, I guess.
                  I've worked hard since dinner, and I want some of your good bread and butter. It's
                  a little singular that no one else cooks so good as you do," said Herbert, as with
                  his usual cheerfulness, he went to the well, filled a basin from the wooden bucket
                  and applied the clear, cold water to his face and head.</p>
               <p>They sat down, each one to a side of the square table. Mrs. Goodwin invoked the
                  blessing of Heaven upon their repast, and with no appetites for food, they began
                  slowly to partake of the evening meal.</p>
               <p>Herbert was fifteen years of age. His forehead was high and broad, and the hair
                  dark and curling. His eyes were of a changeable hue, which defies description. It
                  was next to impossible to tell whether the full, sparkling orbs were dark brown or
                  hazel. The nose was slightly Roman, the lips full and of a roguish expression,
                  while a small dimple in each cheek, when a smile played over his face, gave a
                  pleasing finish to his regularly chiseled features.</p>
               <p>"What shall we do, Brother? Where shall we go?" Effie asked after a painful
                  silence.</p>
               <p>"I can't tell, Sister, but I'll try to think of something to do. By the way,
                  Mother, couldn't we break the force of the deed that rascal's got hold of? Now, I
                  have it, I'll break that piece of writing, and I guess he can't help himself!
                  Come, Mother, cheer up and eat your supper. Will, you shall keep your apple tree.
                  Effie, don't be afraid. <emph>I'll</emph> teach that madcap that he's got
                     <emph>somebody</emph> to deal with."</p>
               <p>"Ah, my dear boy, you are too impetuous. Mr. Wells, of whom I bought the land, is
                  dead. His children are very poor and cannot redeem the place, besides I do not
                  believe a reasonable sum would purchase the deed you speak of.— Hammond has got
                  his eye on this place for some purpose best known to himself, and he is
                  unprincipled to a great degree. We have not the means to go to law upon
                  uncertainties: besides I do not believe a law-suit would benefit us much in the
                  end, even if we were successful. The lawyer's fee is equal to the oppressor's
                  demand. We can get along some way: we will do the best we can."</p>
               <p>Herbert arose, and with the whistle so peculiar to him, sounding cheerfully as
                  ever, started for Mr. Hammond's temporary lodgings.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Goodwin and Effie cleared away the tea things and taking Willie by the hand
                  when their work was done, they wandered forth over every spot that time had made
                  particularly dear to them. Even Willie was sad and seldom spoke, and his mother
                  appeared entirely wrapped in her own sober thoughts. Her face was pale and her
                  lips would sometimes lose their color, bat she said nothing, and seemed to forget
                  that Effie or Willie were with her.</p>
               <p>The walked until tired, and then slowly returned to the house, resumed their
                  different occupations, and waited with anxiety for Herbert to return.</p>
               <p>The well known sound of his footsteps was soon heard coming up the walk. He
                  entered the parlor, seated himself upon the ottoman, and throwing up his beautiful
                  hair with one hand, and bringing the other to his knee with considerable force, he
                  exclaimed that "Ike Hammond would be sorry for this some day."</p>
               <p>"Come, come, my son, don't get angry; the blow is indeed heavy, but He who sendeth
                  the storm, tempereth the wind to the shorn lamb. We must take care that we do not
                  even worse than Mr. Hammond has done."</p>
               <p>Herbert looked abashed as he met his mother's kind, reproving glance. Throwing
                  aside a magazine which he had unconsciously taken up, he looked her steadily in
                  the eye and<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6333-00000009"/> said, "Now, Mother, do you
                  really think that the Almighty sent this blow upon us."</p>
               <p>"Without doubt the land of God is in it, my son. Now tell me, Herbert, did you not
                  begin to think that we were able to get along without any one's help? Have we not
                  placed too much confidence in out own strength? Have you never thought that by our
                  wisdom we have gotten all this?"</p>
               <p>"O, Mother if I could moralize as you can, I would'nt mind difficulties! But when
                  I get away from you and any one crosses my path, I get <emph>so</emph> angry."</p>
               <p>"Did you say anything ugly to Mr. Hammond?"</p>
               <p>"I did. I called him a thief and a villain!"</p>
               <p>Herbert turned scarlet as he made this confession, and his mother looked as if
                  deeply grieved.</p>
               <p>"We must ask God to forgive you for this, my son. Do you feel sorry for your
                  conduct?"</p>
               <p>Tears started from his eyes but he did not reply.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Goodwin took the large old fashioned Bible from its resting-place on the
                  stand, and read some choice portions of its many precious promises, after which
                  they all knelt down and while the mother prayed audibly, the children joined with
                  silent but apparently deep devotion, in the solemn and beautiful exercise.</p>
               <p>"The prayers being over then sweetly they sung." Even Willie could sing
                  charmingly. The hymn chosen was one will suited to the occasion. How many hearts.
                  When oppressed with grief and weighed down by trouble, have found a soothing balm
                  in the words of the old-fashioned hymn:— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l rend="ti-1">"Jerusalem, my glorious home,</l>
                        <l>Name ever dear to me;</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">When will my labors have an end,</l>
                        <l>In joy and peace in thee?"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>When Effie awoke the next morning, the meadow-larks were warbling forth their
                  songs of gladness upon the morning air. The Window of her little bed-room had been
                  left open, admitting the sweet odor of blushing roses, and the pleasant morning
                  breeze played with her sunny curls, as with a young girls usual reluctance about
                  early rising, she hesitated, yawned, and again closed her eyes.</p>
               <p>She soon heard the sound of her mothers footsteps, in the kitchen, and knowing
                  that she ought to stir, she arose, made her simple toilet, and went to the window.
                  The smell of flowers and the songs of birds, made her completely happy for a time.
                  She even forgot that the place was no longer theirs, and reveled in sweetest joy
                  while watching the scene.</p>
               <p>A rap at the door aroused her from the deep reverie into which she had fallen.</p>
               <p>"Come Effie! You'd entirely forget that folks had to get up if you didn't get a
                  hint, wouldn't you? My sissy had better get ready for breakfast."</p>
               <p>Then with a gay laugh Herbert bounded away, and Effie came from her room in time
                  to see his jump the gate with the milk pail in his hand, on the way to the
                  barn-yard.</p>
               <p>"Be quick Effie," said her mother, "and get the lettuce and radishes for
                  breakfast. We must work briskly for the next five days."</p>
               <p>This was the first time that the merry-hearted girl had thought of their
                  misfortune since she awoke, and with a cloud on her usually sunny brow, and a load
                  of unhappy thoughts at her heart, she went with a basket in her hand to the
                  garden. Hastily getting the required vegetables, she went with them to the well
                  and cleansed them in the clear cold water. Then cutting the leaves from the
                  rosy-checked radishes, and the roots from the nice curly-leafed lettuce, she
                  quickly prepared them for the table.</p>
               <p>"Effie," said Herdert as he returned from the barn-yard and set down the milk pail
                  on the curb stone, "come, sister, let me have a kiss; you hav'nt kissed me these
                  two weeks. Don't look so sad. I've got a plan in my head that I'll warrant<pb
                     n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6333-00000010"/> rant will work to a charm. Farmer Gray is
                  going to Oregon next spring, and we can go with him. They've got up a donation law
                  in that far-famed territory, and instead of ten acres of land, we'll have three
                  hundred and twenty. Don't that look like living?"</p>
               <p>"But the distance, brother?"</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! Everything that's worth having is worth working for, and crossing the
                  Plains will only be one summer's work."</p>
               <p>"Come to breakfast children, or have you forgotten to eat?" said their mother as
                  she stepped to the door.</p>
               <p>They went to the kitchen which served the double purpose of kitchen and dining
                  room, placed the lettuce and radishes in a dish, and sat down to the table. Effie
                  was the first to speak. "Herbert thinks he knows what we can do, Mother."</p>
               <p>The visionary and sanguine boy smiled as he told his mother of his bright dreams
                  of the future.</p>
               <p>"The plan does look promising, I believe. I have a valuable gold watch in my
                  possession, your father's wedding gift, which I can part with rather than give up
                  the enterprise. I did intend to have always kept it, but I should wrong his
                  memory, were I to keep it when his children are destitute of life's comforts."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Goodwin appeared to be talking to herself, as was sometimes her habit and
                  when her soliloquy was finished, she looked at her children with a half sad, half
                  pleasant smile and told them that she was willing to try to go.</p>
               <p>"Now, Mother, that's just like Mrs. Goodwin, and that's praise enough for anybody.
                  She is the best woman I ever saw; she has a spoiled boy, however, but I guess it
                  isn't her fault."</p>
               <p>Herbert continued to talk in a gleeful manner, concerning good women in general
                  and Mrs. Goodwin in particular, until all seemed as gay and happy as himself.</p>
               <p>He went away early to his work, promising to call during the day and see Farmer.
                  Gray about going to Oregon.</p>
               <p>Effie and Willie kept busy until ten o'clock with their lessons, and Mrs. Goodwin,
                  when not engaged in household duties, kept herself busily employed with her
                  needle. She was troubled, but the true spirit of Christian fortitude sustained
                  her. "He heareth even the young ravens when they cry," was a promise not to be
                  disregarded.</p>

               <head type="sub">A VISIT TO FARMER GRAY'S RESIDENCE.</head>
               <p>READER, in the beginning of out story you went with us in imagination to the
                  widow's cottage.</p>
               <p>Now, follow us again through the same number of years, and we will go with you to
                  Farmer Gray's Illinois home.</p>
               <p>The house was built of large, rough logs, and was two stories high. The crevices
                  between the logs were <emph>chinked</emph> with pieces of split wood. The rooms
                  were made tight by a plastering of mud, with the exception of the front room,
                  which, in Mrs. Gray's language, was <emph>pinted</emph> with lime.</p>
               <p>The walls were decorated by numerous Pictorial Brother Jonathan's. A double mud
                  and stick chimney, with fireplaces of huge dimensions, was situated like an ugly
                  dirt mound as it was, in the middle of the house. The furniture looked just like
                  the people, and the people looked just like the furniture.</p>
               <p>"Well, la bless us! I wonder what this world's comin' to next! Here's a poor woman
                  been turned out of her home by a trick of out laws and a villain's meanness. I
                  don't know<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6333-00000011"/> what in the world the poor
                  creetur'll do. Polly, ain't Effie Good'in a comin' through the bars? Yes, bless
                  her soul! The poor child wants something, I know."</p>
               <p>"Howdy, Effie! Is the folks all well?"</p>
               <p>"Very well, I thank you, but Mother is a little depressed in spirits."</p>
               <p>"Well, la bless us! If yer mother hain't seed trouble enough to set the poor
                  creetur' crazy afore now; an' jist as she gits lifted up like, an' begins to think
                  she can live easy, here comes this blow on her head. I've hearn tell of a rightous
                  God, but I guess he's asleep nowadays," and uttering this ejaculation, she passed
                  her hand over her eyes and sighed, as if overcome by intensity of feeling, as she
                  wiped the perspiration from her fat, full face. A face, a like expressive of good
                  humor and sympathy.</p>
               <p>"Why, Polly, who's a comin'? If it ain't Erbert Good'in as I'm alive."</p>
               <p>"Good morning, Mrs. Gray, quite a pleasant day," said Herbert as he took a seat
                  without noticing that his sister was present.</p>
               <p>"Yes may well say it's pleasant, for prettier weather than this never looked out
                  o' doors," and the old lady held a turkey-wing fan over her eyes, as if the bright
                  sunshine caused them to be painful.</p>
               <p>"My mother has met with a sad misfortune, Mrs. Gray. As we will have to stir in
                  order to make a living, I thought I would call and see Farmer Gray about going to
                  Oregon."</p>
               <p>"Oregon! Well, if that don't beat me! Who'd a ever thought that as great a lady as
                  Miss Good'in would a tried to go across the Plains? But I'm glad to hear it boy.
                  No doubt my old man can strike a bargain with ye, for if ye want to go, of course
                  ye ought. Don't ye see yer sister's here?</p>
               <p>Herbert looked surprised, and turning, beheld Effie seated in a chair, almost
                  behind him.</p>
               <p>"Why, Effie! what are you doing two miles from home?"</p>
               <p>"I came because mother thought after you went away, that we had better speak to
                  Mr. Gray about renting an outhouse in his yard for the fall and winter.
                  Immigration is pouring in all the time, and every house that is fit to live in
                  will soon be occupied."</p>
               <p>"That is well considered, for I had not thought of it at all. Strange, that I
                  should have forgotten it, but Mother knows what she's about."</p>
               <p>"Why the la me! Do ye spose ye need to ask for sich a little favor as that, honey?
                  Yer mother might ha' moved right here and never asked a question. Joseph and Sally
                  Gray ain't the folks to turn off feller creeturs in distress."</p>
               <p>Farmer Gray was a tall, loose-jointed, slovenly looking personage, with jet black
                  hair, and heavy, bristle-looking beard, of the same sable hue. The forehead was
                  low, but well developed, the eyes black and sparkling, the nose and mouth large.
                  His homely visage was lighted up by an honest, kind-looking gleam from the eyes,
                  that relieved the otherwise forbidding expression of his features.</p>
               <p>"Why, good mornin' children," he said cordially, as he extended a hand to each of
                  his youthful visitors. A benevolent smile played over his rough, uncouth
                  countenance, as he eyed them closely.</p>
               <p>"Is there nothin' I can do to save yer mammy?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gray interposed, and told him all she had learned from them in her own
                  way.</p>
               <p>After hearing their story and request, he pulled his slouched hat over his eyes
                  for a few moments that seemed to his anxious visitors like so many hours. In fact,
                  it seemed to then that he did not intend to reply.</p>
               <p>At length he raised his heard, and looking at them with a deep, searching glance,
                  he said slowly that they were welcome to live in the house, rent free, as long as
                  they wished.</p>
               <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6333-00000012"/>
               <p>"And has yer mammy got any money to buy a wagon and team?"</p>
               <p>"We have but little money, sir, but Mother has a costly gold watch which she will
                  part with rather than give up the enterprise. We have some property that will
                  bring cash, and we think we can raise the necessary funds without much
                  difficulty."</p>
               <p>"The right kind of grit, my boy; the right kind of grit. Ye'll be a man yit afore
                  Polly, I'll be bound."</p>
               <p>This caused them to turn their attention to Polly, whom they had scarcely noticed
                  before. She had the flaxen hair and blue eyes of her mother. The action of the sun
                  upon her naturally transparent skin, made her, as her father laughingly observed,
                  "as speckled as a turkey's egg."</p>
               <p>She wore an expression of sadness and anxiety about the eyes and mouth, which was
                  discernible the moment good attention was paid to her looks.</p>
               <p>Her form was short and stout, her dress plain, coarse and very clean. The sleeves,
                  turned back at the wrists, showed that she was used to the mysteries of hard
                  work.</p>
               <p>"Come, Pop! ye'd better pick the geese or I'll turn 'em outside. Ye know mammy
                  says if ye don't git that bed afore the geese has to be sold, ye'll never git
                  it!"</p>
               <p>Herbert and Effie looked in the direction of this new voice, and beheld the
                  tangled hair and roguish eyes of a dirty-faced urchin, standing outside the wall,
                  with his eyes placed far enough past the door facing to give him a chance to peep
                  at the company.</p>
               <p>As quick as the words were spoken, he darted away, with a hop and a jump, slapping
                  his sides, and singing to the tune of "O, Susannah:" <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l rend="ti-1">I jumped upon de telegraph,</l>
                        <l>And floated down de ribbah;</l>

                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"I never could larn that child no manners," said Mrs. Gray, with a vexed look.</p>
               <p>"Never mind, Sally, never mind. Jed's just like I was when I was a boy, and ye
                  think yerself that I'm some persimmons now, don't ye?"</p>
               <p>The visitors had stayed their allotted time, and arose to take leave of their
                  coarse but kind hearted neighbors, when Polly, who had left the room when Jed came
                  to the door, returned with four large apples in her hands and requested them to
                  take them home, as there was one for each member of the family. They thanked her
                  for the present, and bade the family good morning.</p>
               <p>They had walked half way to the bars, which were used instead of a gate, when
                  Farmer Gray came to the door and said in a loud tone. "I say, young uns, tell the
                  widow that I'll move her things for her a Thursday or Saturday, but I could'nt
                  come a Friday no how, bekase Friday's an unlucky day."</p>
               <p>Herbert choked down his risibles and replied gravely, that he would let him know
                  which day they could move."</p>
               <p>"Remember, I can't come a Friday."</p>
               <p>"Certainly, said Herbert, as they made a parting bow and walked slowly
                  homeward.</p>
               <p>"Effie, did you notice how sad Polly looked? There must be something on her mind.
                  I guess it's a love affair, for I heard Sam Green, who works with me, say that if
                  Polly went to Oregon, old Gray would be smarter nor he was."</p>
               <p>Effie could not help laughing at her brother's tone of imitation, but said that if
                  Sam married Polly, she hoped he would go to Oregon, for she had taken quite a
                  fancy to her.</p>
               <p>"She's a mighty good creetur, that's a fact," said Herbert, still mischievously
                  disposed to mock the language he had heard during their call.</p>
               <p>"We must to talk this way before Mother, Herbert, for it would distress her."</p>
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6333-00000013"/>
               <p>"Now, you'll see if I don't make her laugh till her sides ache to-night. She'll
                  curl her lip a little and say I'm rude, but she'll be pleased after all," he said,
                  as he sprung nimbly from root to pebble and from pebble again, going through a
                  variety of gymnastic manœuvers in the course of the next ten minutes.</p>
               <p>A half hour's walk brought them to where the roads forked; Herbert took the one
                  leading to the house of Farmer Green, for whom he was at work, while Effie pursued
                  her solitary way through a dense forest of sugar maple, towards her dear little
                  cottage home. She did not dare to think very deeply about their change of
                  circumstances, lest she would look sad before her mother. Hurriedly gathering a
                  handful of wild flowers and a bunch of black berries for Willie, she hastened on,
                  and reached home, just as the scent of certain savory dishes streaming on the
                  stove, told her that dinner was about ready. She saw that her mother had been
                  weeping during her absence.</p>
               <p>"Come, Mamma, it's too late to cry now. I have all the good news imaginable to
                  tell you of," she said cheerfully. Then throwing her sun bonnet upon the back of a
                  chair, and speaking with childlike impatience, she proceeded to relate the result
                  of the morning's adventure.</p>
               <p>"What have you got for me, sissy?"</p>
               <p>Willie climbed into her lap and put his arms lovingly around her neck. She patted
                  his velvet checks, and showed him the bunch of flowers and cluster of berries she
                  had gathered.</p>
               <p>"I told you. Ma, that his would bring me something nice," said the little fellow,
                  dancing around the room, to the imminent danger of upsetting the table.</p>
               <p>"Be quiet, darling; Mother's pet mustn't be rude in-doors."</p>
               <p>"May I jump and play in the yard, Ma?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, my love."</p>
               <p>"He went into the back yard, where he capered around in a perfect glee until
                  dinner was ready; when, at his mother's bidding, he came in quietly and made no
                  further noise.</p>
               <p>Effie despatched her dinner with an appetite such as many a possessor of millions
                  may wish for but never realize.</p>
               <p>O, ye effeminate creatures of fashion, who know nothing of the mysteries of
                  healthful toil who merely exist to be waited upon, whose imaginary wants increase
                  and multiply each succeeding day; how little do you know of the pleasure of a
                  healthful dinner, after a few hours of invigorating exercise!</p>
               <p>Herbert returned at tea-time, and when Effie looked at him, she began to think
                  that the remarks he had intended to make for his mother's amusement, had vanished
                  into thin air. There was no roguish look about the mouth and eyes, such as she had
                  anticipated, but he looked more serious than usual. He said but little until tea
                  was half over. Then, with a peculiarly roguish curl of his under lip, he
                  exclaimed, "Mother, you can't think how nearly we have approached to the edge of a
                  frightful precipice without having the least idea of our danger."</p>
               <p>"Why so?"</p>
               <p>"Why, don't you think that the hot headed specimen of Young America which you are
                  bringing up, was thinking of leaving his home on Friday! And he would have
                  persisted in that extremely perilous undertaking, had he not been kindly warned of
                  his danger by Farmer Gray."</p>
               <p>Herbert saw that the right cord was touched, for his mother's eyes began to
                  sparkle as if she was amused, and keeping the advantage over her, which he had
                  gained, he said "Farmer Gray will move our things a Thursday or Saturday, but he
                  couldn't do is a Friday <emph>no</emph> how, bekase Friday's an on lucky day."</p>
               <p>Then, in an extremely ludicrous manner, he related all the morning's adventure and
                  conversation very accurately.</p>
               <p>When he came to speak of the urchin Jed, he arose from his chair, went outside of
                  the door, peeped from behind the casing, as Jed had done, and in the child's voice
                  and manner, exclaimed: "Come, Pop, ye'd better pick the geese or I'll turn 'em<pb
                     n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6333-00000014"/> outside. Ye know mammy says if ye don't
                  git that bed afore the geese has to be sold, ye'll never git it."</p>
               <p>Then, bounding away and slapping his sides, he sung Jed's words and tune. He then
                  came in, seated himself in imitation of Mrs. Gray, looked vexed, and said: "I
                  never could I' am that child no manners."</p>
               <p>Then, taking another chair, he imitated Farmer Gray's words and manner. "'Never
                  mind, Sally, never mind; Jed's jist like I was when I was a boy, and ye think
                  yerself that I'm some persimmons now, don't ye?"</p>
               <p>His mother was so much amused by his comic actions and words, that long before he
                  had finished, she was laughing to the extent of his ambition.</p>
               <p>"O, Herbert, you are too rude," she said as quick as she could speak
                  distinctly.</p>
               <p>"Now, sister, am I not a prophet?"</p>
               <p>I'll give you credit for success in all you undertake," laughed his sister.</p>
               <p>"Herbert showed the apple he had carried in his pocket during the day. Willie
                  clapped his hands at sight of the blushing fruit, and they were all in better
                  spirits than they had been for forty-eight hours.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE REMOVAL.</head>
               <p>THE WEEK passed rapidly away. Effie had been kept busy much of the time in
                  gathering the seeds of flowers and vegetables. While engaged in this pleasant
                  occupation she appeared happy and contented. But when a time for rest would come,
                  she would shed many and bitter tears at the thought of leaving her childhood's
                  home.</p>
               <p>The morning appointed for the flitting was very pleasant but the rising sun was
                  surrounded by gorgeous, gold-tinged clouds, indicating the approach of rain.</p>
               <p>All hands were kept busy until about noon, when the last load was made ready for
                  the road. Mrs. Goodwin and Willie mounted the bulky load of household articles,
                  and rode away with Farmer Gray, leaving Herbert and Effie to drive the cow. The
                  playful calf, as if conscious that they were going to take it from its home, was
                  not willing to leave the pasture, and it was long before they could get it through
                  the gate.</p>
               <p>They had proceeded but a few rods from the house when they met Mr. Hammond, who
                  tauntingly told them that if he could only prove that they were negroes and
                  belonged to him, he would be just "in town."</p>
               <p>Herbert turned ashy pale and bit his lips but said nothing, while the hot blood
                  mounted to Effie's forehead and tinged her cheeks with its crimson tide.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hammond could never forget that his father had been a wealthy citizen of
                  Virginia. As he had been brought up among slaves he of course had a hatred for
                  poor white folks, which his own poverty and debauchery had in no way diminished.
                  He delighted to teaze even those who had been deeply wronged by his own
                  misdeeds.</p>
               <p>When young he had gloried in the appellation of "a fast young man." and kept the
                  company of the idle and vicious, until he was foremost in almost every kind of
                  wickedness. His father tried to expostulate with him about his conduct, but to no
                  purpose, and his crowning act of recklessness was a marriage with a low ignorant
                  woman whose habits were almost as bad as his own. His father died soon after this
                  unhappy union, and the estate was transferred to the son, who was in no way
                  qualified to take care of his property. He was at times so cruel to his slaves
                  that they would run away by dozens, and finally, in a night of dissipation, he
                  lost all his remaining<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6333-00000015"/> possessions, at
                  the gaming table. His wife got intoxicated on the strength (not of his misfortune
                  but of bad whiskey), and would remain drunk for days, while Hammond would curse
                  his stars and rave like a madman, after taking this usual potations.</p>
               <p>From that time forward they were obliged to beg, to steal, and to take all kinds
                  of advantages of their low associates, when moving from hut to hut in order to
                  make a living. His family increased rapidly, until at the time of the opening of
                  our story, he had seven children, all promising to make just such men and women as
                  their parents were.</p>
               <p>He had, by different changes, chances, losses and successes, contrived to find his
                  way to Illinois, and obtaining in some manner, the deed of trust that called for
                  Mrs. Goodwin's home, he seemed elated to a high pitch, not so much on account of
                  his own good luck, as on account of the widow's misfortune.</p>
               <p>The brother and sister had not proceeded far with their cow, before the sky became
                  darkened and the dead silence which precedes a thunder storm, cast a spell upon
                  their feelings that was indescribable.</p>
               <p>The rain was falling in torrents when they reached the forest of maple trees,
                  spoken of in the last chapter.</p>
               <p>Sheets of lightning played in awful grandeur above their heads lighting up the
                  majestic tree tops with unearthly splendor. Peal after peal of deafening thunder
                  echoed and re-echoed through the timber, while ever and anon, the crash of falling
                  trees, served to make the din move awfully appaling. They were both used to
                  thunder storms, and taking refuge under the gigantic trunk of an uprooted monarch
                  of the forest they waited in silence for the storm to abate.</p>
               <p>The cow and calf, as if looking to their guides for protection, came up to the
                  place of refuge and crouched with them under the same shelter. The rain soon
                  ceased to fall, and hailstones of an enormous size bounded from the huge covering
                  over their heads and rolled in piles at their feet. Effie nestled closely to her
                  brother's side, and watched this war of elements with intense anxiety. Every few
                  seconds a flash of lightning would cause every leaf and bough to glow as if made
                  of burnished gold. At such times, Effie would look at her brother and feel
                  astonished to see his radient face. He seemed as one in a trance. A sweet smile
                  played over his glowing countenance, and as the conflict of elements became yet
                  more terrible to Effie, he appeared actually to <emph>drink pure delight.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>The noise of falling hailstones, the crashing of falling trees, and the sonorous
                  sound of the deep-toned thunder, kept them for a full half hour from hearing each
                  others voices. At last the clouds began to pass away, the lightning flashed but
                  seldom, the thunder rolled at a greater distance, and the wind ceased to blow,
                  except in gentle whirls and whispering eddies through the grand old trees.</p>
               <p>As soon as the storm, abated, they endeavored to proceed forward with their cow
                  again before them.</p>
               <p>They had gone but a short distance before they found the road completely blocked
                  up by broken and uprooted trees, and it was with great difficulty that they could
                  find openings in the forest, through which they could pass. Just as they were
                  emerging from the wood they met Farmer Gray, mounted on a little mule.</p>
               <p>"Hallo, young 'uns," he said in an excited voice, "I see yer alive yet, but I
                  don't see how ye ever escaped."</p>
               <p>He then halted in the road before them, and turning himself leisurely in the
                  saddle, he added "Warn't ye a'most scar'd to death."</p>
               <p>"Effie seemed frightened, but I never before felt so happy in my life, sir," said
                  Herbert.</p>
               <p>"I felt that we were in the hands of God, and I rejoiced to<pb n="30-31"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000016"/> see His power. My whole being was excited with a
                  kind of unearthly joy, and I thanked the Almighty Ruler for having given me this
                  opportunity to see His elements charged with destruction."</p>
               <p>Reader, you should have seen this naturally gay and wild-spirited boy as he
                  uttered these words. He seemed excited till his soul was speaking through his
                  eyes. His voice was calm, but had a kind of unearthly sound, as if the mind was
                  far above the body.</p>
               <p>Farmer Gray looked at him for a few moments without speaking. At length he
                  said—"Well boy, I must say, ye'r the greatest specimen of humanity for a fifteen
                  year old that I ever did see. Who'd a ever though that anybody o' your age would
                  talk that way?"</p>
               <p>"Was mamma uneasy about us?" Effie asked.</p>
               <p>"Well yes. Yer mammy took on powerful, an' as quick as it quit stormin' I come
                  after ye,—Effie ye'd better git on my mule an' go home as quick as you can.
                  'Erbart an' me 'll drive the cow."</p>
               <p>Farmer Gray lifted Effie upon the mule, adjusted the stirrup to suit her foot,
                  gave her a switch, and started the docile animal by giving him a rather
                  unceremonious kick in the side. She rode on at a brisk trot and soon reached the
                  house. Her mother was standing by the bars, looking anxiously down the road, and
                  leaning against the bar post for support. A faint smile flitted over her features
                  when she saw her daughter, who glad to relieve the anxiety which her sudden coming
                  had not wholly expelled from her mother's heart hurriedly told her that Herbert
                  was safe, and would soon be in sight of the house. She then gave up the mule to
                  Jed's care, and went into the house with her mother, who soon made her
                  comfortable, by helping her to put on a complete suit of dry clothing. The air had
                  become so suddenly cooled by the storm, that Mrs. Gray had built a roaring fire of
                  hickory logs and maple splinters, which was burning its liveliest when Effie was
                  ready to enjoy its cheerful heat. She related the whole story of the storm with
                  childlike artlessness.</p>
               <p>"O, mamma, it was so terrible! You can't think how dreadful it was to be in the
                  timber, hearing the groaning of the great maples, seeing the lightning's flashes,
                  and hearing the awful thunder. And Herbert! O, mother, if you had seen him! I
                  don't believe he's afraid of <emph>anything.</emph> He astonished Farmer Gray by
                  his talk about the power of God in the elements."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Goodwin burst into tears.</p>
               <p>"Why, mother, what's the matter?"</p>
               <p>"O, my child, the actions of Herbert in a storm, remind me so forcibly of your
                  father's feelings at such a time, that it seems as if he <emph>must</emph> be
                  living."</p>
               <p>"Isn't pa with the angels now, ma?" asked Willie, earnestly.</p>
               <p>"Yes, dear, your pa is much better off to-day than we are."</p>
               <p>"I want to die ma; I want to go to Heaven and live with the angels where pa
                  is."</p>
               <p>Like any other child, Willie had his playful moods, though, <emph>unlike</emph>
                  most other children of his age, he had many thoughtful moments. He had been told
                  so much about his father, of whom he remembered but little, that the seemed to
                     <emph>realize</emph> the truth of what his mother had often told him about his
                  pa living with angels, while <emph>her</emph> feelings about the matter were only
                     <emph>ideal.</emph> It seemed hard for her to really consider her husband as
                  being in a happy land, while the impressible mind of her little boy, could easily
                  feel and <emph>know</emph> the truth of his only parent's teachings. How hard it
                  is for men and women to be, in the language of the Scriptures, "as a little
                  child." We tell our children what we actually believe but our <emph>ideal
                     belief</emph> immediately becomes, in their impressive imaginations,
                     <emph>undoubtable reality.</emph>
               </p>
               <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6333-00000017"/>
               <p>"Do you want to leave ma and brother, and sister, darling?"</p>
               <p>The little fellow climbed into his mother's lap, kissed her lovingly and answered,
                  "No, ma, but we can both go to Heaven, and we will before long."</p>
               <p>Herbert and Farmer Gray arrived at this moment. Herbert knew that if his mother
                  were to see him in the state of mind the storm had caused, old remembrances would
                  be awakened; and to Effie's great pleasure, he appeared merrier than usual. She
                  had such an instinctive horror of anything but sunshine, flowers and good humor,
                  that she had dreaded the effect of Herbert's arrival.</p>
               <p>All soon forgot the words of little Willie upon the subject of death. Is there not
                  sometimes a warning in the words of children? Are we not often reminded with
                  startling force of something a little child has said, which at the time it was
                  spoken, made but little impression upon our minds? But we must not anticipate.</p>
               <p>Supper was announced in Mrs. Gray's kitchen, and they were soon seated at a table
                  which was well loaded with salt pork, vegetables, johnny-cake, butter and
                  buttermilk. The next day being Sunday, the Goodwin family were to remain in the
                  house with their well meaning hostess, who seemed willing to do everything in her
                  power to oblige them. When they awoke on the clear and lovely Sabbath morning,
                  they were surprised to find that Mrs. Gray had been astir for an hour. A
                  substantial breakfast was smoking invitingly upon the long, well loaded table,
                  when they entered the kitchen to perform the morning's ablution at the family
                  washing bowl. Polly came in with her face flushed by a morning walk in the bracing
                  air. After breakfast she asked Effie to walk with her around the garden and
                  orchard. Effie was anxious to know what was the cause of her melancholy expression
                  of countenance, but did not like to ask her about it, because she dreaded to hear
                  a sorrowful story.</p>
               <p>"Why were you not at home yesterday?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"I've been to daddy Green's a weavin' a carpet. Do ye know, Sam an' me's a goin'
                  to be married in September, an' I want somethin' to begin house-keepin' on."</p>
               <p>"Are you going to stay in Illinois and let your folks all go to Oregon?"</p>
               <p>"That's what I dunno, an' I'm mightily east down about it. Ye see Sam's under age,
                  an' his daddy aint willin' for him to go off."</p>
               <p>Effie knew of no consolation to offer, and soon changed the subject. When they
                  returned to the house, Polly went to work clearing the breakfast table; and seeing
                  Herbert standing in a meditating mood under a cottonwood by the fence, Effie ran
                  to him and related the news concerning Polly's marriage.</p>
               <p>"Why, sister, I have known that these three-days. Sam told me about it and said
                  that Polly would tell you. I told him that if Polly told you I would know it in
                  ten minutes, for girls can't keep secrets," said Herbert roguishly. Effie felt a
                  little piqued at her brother's rudeness, as she was pleased to call it, and told
                  him she would "match him for it some day."</p>
               <p>"You are not angry, are you sissy? I didn't mean to vex you."</p>
               <p>He threw his arms around his sister's neck and gave her a half a dozen kisses
                  before she could get away. She tried to pout, but concluded with a laugh, as she
                  tripped away to the house, where they spent the day in reading and singing.</p>
               <p>The next morning they all went to work in good earnest, and soon had the pleasure
                  of seeing Farmer Gray's out-house assume a cheerful aspect. The room was eighteen
                  feet square; a large, awkward, mud and stick chimney adorned one end of the
                  building. There were two doors and two windows, each placed opposite to the other.
                  Mrs. Goodwin made a kitchen of one corner, by placing the stove near the<pb
                     n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6333-00000018"/> fire-place, with an elbow in the pipe to
                  conduct the smoke to the chimney flue. The cooking utensils, the little cupboard
                  and kitchen table, all found a place in this corner. Two beds were placed in the
                  back part of the building and a curtain hung between them, served as a partition
                  for a dressing room. In this house, Mrs. Goodwin, who had always been used to
                  refinement, though of late years in an humble way, was to spend the coming fall
                  and winter. A flood of golden sunlight, that last beams of the departing
                  day-Illuminator, peeped through the muslin curtains of he western window just as
                  her last duty for the day was complete. She gazed upon the massive pillars of
                  golden clouds in the horizon, and wondered at the peace of mind, the calm
                  resignation she felt, when thinking of her altered circumstances. She opened the
                  Bible:—"I have been young and now I am old, but I have never seen the righteous
                  forsaken, or his seed begging bread," were the words of inspiration that met her
                  trusting eyes.</p>

               <head type="sub">POLLY GRAY'S WEDDING.</head>
               <p>SIX WEEKS passed pleasantly away. The golden leaves of September began to fall in
                  fantastical looking heaps in the forests and orchards. The merry, but warning
                  "houk, houk" of wild geese was beginning to be frequently heard as they were
                  taking their timely flight southward. Autumnal winds began to sigh around the
                  dwellings of the rich and poor in melancholy music.</p>
               <p>Farmer Gray was unusually busy with his fall work; each person seemed bent upon
                  working at his particular vocation with uncommon vigor. Effie was sitting one
                  evening at the foot of a shock of fodder, watching a glorious sunset, when Polly
                  came to her and informed her that she was to be married the ensuing Thursday,
                  provided they could finish gathering corn, a business to which she had lent a
                  helping hand for a fortnight.</p>
               <p>"By what right does corn gathering interfere with you wedding, Polly?"</p>
               <p>"Why, ye see, pap's mighty busy jist now, and so's Sam's folks. I guess they'll
                  git through corn cuttin' by Tuesday night, then they'll have Wednesday to fix for
                  the weddin'."</p>
               <p>They were interupted by a loud call from Mrs. Gray. Polly told Effie that there
                  would be meeting at the school house the next Sunday and left her to her own
                  reflections. She sat for some minutes with a corn stalk in her hand, twisting the
                  long, dry leaves around her fingers, and thinking of, she knew not what, when
                  hearing a rustling among the stalks, she turned and beheld Herbert coming towards
                  her. He took a seat on the stalks beside his sister and told her that he was going
                  to church the next Sunday, adding that meeting was so seldom heard of in that neck
                  of the woods, that the thought of attending church once more, excited him.</p>
               <p>"I wish Sam Green would take Polly to Oregon if he marries her," said Effie. "She
                  feels so badly about leaving her folks that I hate to see her compelled to stay
                  behind."</p>
               <p>"It will all come right, Effie. 'Daddy Green,' as Polly calls him, is going to
                  sell his farm and give half of the money as a wedding portion to Sam. Sam doesn't
                  know it yet, for his father intends to surprise him. I got the news from the old
                  gentleman himself, and he told me not to tell either Sam or Polly."</p>
               <p>"But aren't you afraid to tell me, Herbert? You know girls can't keep
                  secrets."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw, sister! don't you suppose I know what I'm about?<pb n="36-37"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000019"/> I thought you had forgotten my old joke, but I see
                  you don't forget so easily after all."</p>
               <p>Sabbath morning came. A bright, balmy sunshine glittered through the branches of
                  the half denuded trees. The sweet song and merry chatter of birds were heard as
                  they collected in large companies to consult together about removing to a southern
                  clime. All nature wore a sad yet pleasing air, rendered ten-fold more delightful
                  than the autumn would otherwise have been, by the warblers of Heaven, which were
                  chanting songs of praise to their Creator, who had blessed them with a charming
                  summer, and was now permitting them to wander away in search of warmer regions.
                  The path meandered through the woods to the school house, which was situated about
                  half a mile distant from Farmer Gray's residence. They all walked in silence
                  through the solitary, wild looking forest. The sound of footsteps among the
                  rustling leaflets, the occasional warble of some solitary bird, that had not yet
                  joined the thronging multitudes of its kind, with sometimes an exclamation of
                  delight from Willie, were the only sounds that greeted the cars of those who were
                  wending their thoughtful way towards the place of worship.</p>
               <p>An excellent sermon was preached by a Congregationalist minister upon the subject
                  of Death and Resurrection. The time and season was suited to the subject. Though
                  the house was so crowded that most of the men were compelled to stand in order to
                  make room for the ladies to be seated, yet all appeared sorry when the service was
                  concluded.</p>
               <p>After the neighborly congratulations, so common in a country meeting house, wee
                  exchanged, the congregation began slowly to disperse. Effie had stepped out of the
                  door and was waiting for her mother to follow, when Polly came out, escorted by
                  Will Black, who marched off with her, apparently quite proud of his prize, while
                  Sam Green turned away looking the very picture of chagrin.</p>
               <p>"I see," said Joe. Brown, turning to Sam with a roguish laugh, "that its hard
                  tellin' whether the Gray's agoin' to be dyed Green or Black."</p>
               <p>A loud laugh from the bystanders, heightened Sam's confusion, when Herbert Goodwin
                  stepped up to Brown and exclaimed: "We can easily discover that she prefers both
                  Green and Black before Brown."</p>
               <p>"Durened if she ain't welcome to 'em for all o' me," said Joe.</p>
               <p>"You didn't talk that way last Saturday night, <emph>did</emph> ye sonny?" said
                  Farmer Gray, who had heard the conversation, and who felt a little proud of the
                  attentions his daughter received from the rustic rivals. This of course turned the
                  laugh upon Brown, who mounted his horse and rode rapidly away. Sam Green's younger
                  brother, who gloried in the appellation of 'Jake,' offered to accompany Effie to
                  her home. Mrs. Goodwin smiled:—"I appreciate your kind intention Jacob, but for
                  the present I feel competent to chaperon my daughter without your help."</p>
               <p>The boy bowed to the smiling lady, and retreated under cover of his profuse
                  blushes.</p>
               <p>As they walked slowly homeward, Mrs. Goodwin asked her children many questions
                  concerning the sermon they had heard. They answered her questions so correctly,
                  that Farmer Gray's attention was arrested. He listened for sometime in silence,
                  and finally interrupted the widow's questions by asking her how it was possible
                  for them to remember so much of the sermon.</p>
               <p>"I always consider it to be my duty to pay good attention to preaching myself and
                  in order to make my children do the same, I invariably catechise them
                  closely."</p>
               <p>"Why, <emph>I</emph> couldn't recollect enough about a sermon to ask the children
                  questions, and Sally's the same way."</p>
               <p>"I think that if we were to worship God more in secret, we<pb n="38-39"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000020"/> would not find it so hard to give our attention to
                  His Word upon the Sabbath day. I fear that instead of the grace of God in out
                  hearts, we too often take out worldly business, and we cannot then pay due
                  attentions to what we hear at church."</p>
               <p>"Well, religion's a good thing in its place, but it always appears to me like
                  somethin' so disagreeable, that I dread to have anything to do with it. Now that
                  very preachers that we've hearn to-day would feel above me, 'cause I don't wear
                  store clothes and talk like a gentleman. The most of folks I see that claim to be
                  christians, act like they're above common folks."</p>
               <p>"What you say is but too true with a great, many, but the majority are not so. I
                  think there is too muck whole-souled piety in the churches for such feelings to be
                  anything like universal among professors of Christianity."</p>
               <p>"Religion'll do for stiff, starchy folks, that belongs to the upper crust, but
                  such as me had better put it off till I come to die; time enough then."</p>
               <p>"Behold now is the accepted time and now is the day of salvation," said Mrs.
                  Goodwin, in a voice husky with emotion.</p>
               <p>At dinner, Mrs. Goodwin gently reproved Herbert for taking a part in a coarse jest
                  upon the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>"I really couldn't help it, mother. Brown insulted Sam and knew he deserved the
                  joke. It would not have hurt him so badly, if he had not been interested."</p>
               <p>During the week, great preparations were made for the wedding. The rustic
                  neighbors for miles around, were invited, while Yankees, as they called all people
                  of refinement, were slighted with impunity, because, as Jed said to Effie: "They
                  think themselves a <emph>heap</emph> better nor their neighbors. Mammy says she's
                  glad she know'd yer mother a fore this, or she'd a' slighted her too. She thinks
                  yer mammy's what daddy calls 'some persimmons.'"</p>
               <p>"Effie," said Herbert on Wednesday evening, "do you know when this wedding is
                  going to come off?"</p>
               <p>"I have not inquired about it."</p>
               <p>"Well, I'll tell you. The performance will take place tomorrow at two o'clock. Sam
                  told me so this morning."</p>
               <p>"Why, Herbert, you're behind the times! Polly told me all about it a week ago. I
                  thought I would not say anything to you about, for Sam would tell you, and I would
                  get to hear it the second time. Boy's can't keep secrets."</p>
               <p>"I'll give you credit this time, sister. I really thought that you could not have
                  kept that much of your mind from me for any consideration."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I could not have done so, but you showed me how, and I thought I could
                  match you one time."</p>
               <p>At ten o'clock on Thursday morning, the guests began to assemble, and long before
                  two, the whole company was collected and waiting impatiently for the appearance of
                  the bride and groom. A curtain which had been hung up in the back part of the best
                  room to form a dressing closet, was at length drawn aside and Polly appeared,
                  attired in a very neat barred jaconet dress, which she had been busy for two days
                  in rejuvenating for the occasion. The sudden exposure of her countenance before
                  the company, gave to her cheeks a ruddy hue that almost hid the freckles which
                  usually shone so conspicuously as to hide all traces of beauty in her round, full
                  face. Sam was dressed in a complete suit of homespun blue jeans. His features were
                  tolerably handsome, and a certain air of drollery which was natural to him, gave
                  him a tact of conversing agreeably among his associates, notwithstanding his
                  extreme bashfulness, which he said had always been the plague of his life. The
                  Esquire arose as they entered the apartment, and after a short ceremony, told the
                     company<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6333-00000021"/> that "Now was the time to
                  commence salutations." A regular "kissing bee" among "all hands" followed this
                  announcement, and was only stopped by the stentorian voice of Farmer Gray
                  proclaiming that dinner was ready. After partaking of a substantial feast, which,
                  in Mrs. Gray's opinion, "put to shame the knicknackeries of the fashionables," the
                  company went to the barn, which had been decorated with evergreens, and dancing
                  began in good earnest. A fiddler was perched in the hay overhead, who performed in
                  really good style. Mrs. Goodwin and her children watched the performance until it
                  was not longer a novelty, and leaving Herbert to enjoy himself in the society of a
                  very young lady who could dance superbly, they left the barn and went back to the
                  house.</p>
               <p>After the dance was concluded, the company all returned to the dwelling, where
                  pies, cakes and fruit were passed round in baskets, waiters being a luxury they
                  would not countenance because Yankees used such articles. Jokes innumerable were
                  passed among different persons in the assembly, and were received, sometimes in a
                  pleasant manner or answered with playful repartee, and sometimes with petulant
                  replies and sharp retorts.</p>
               <p>"I guess, Joe Brown, you see now what color the Gray's pitched on, don't you?"
                  said Sam, in an exultant tone.</p>
               <p>"If she's as green by nature as the Green she married, I'm afraid the cows will
                  eat all the young Green's" retorted Joe.</p>
               <p>"D'ye think Brown would have done any better?" said Will Black.</p>
               <p>"Brown ain't fond of Gray no way, like Green and Black is," exclaimed Joe.</p>
               <p>"Brown seemed to think that Gray would a' suited him mighty well about last
                  Saturday night," laughed Farmer Gray, who enjoyed the joke as much as any one
                  else.</p>
               <p>A loud ha, ha, from all the listeners, followed these coarse jests, and Joe Brown
                  and Will Black left the place amid the jeers of half a score of boys.</p>
               <p>On Friday, a dinner was given at "daddy Green's," and with the exception of the
                  marriage ceremony, everything passed off much the same as on the wedding day. Sam
                  was agreeably surprised by the present of a round sum of gold from his father, and
                  Polly's happiness was restored by the knowledge of the fact that she was to go
                  with her parents to Oregon. The hoar frosts, the chilling blasts, the driving
                  rains, and mantling snows of winter, came steadily on. Herbert, Effie and Jed
                  attended the district school, where they enjoyed many advantages. Polly stayed for
                  the winter at the house of her father-in-law, engaged in marking patch-work
                  quilts, weaving blankets, etc., for future house-keeping purposes.</p>
               <p>We will now leave the present subject of our story and go to another place, to
                  describe another company, who are to fill an important part in the sequel of our
                  narrative.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE WELDEN AND MANSFIELD FAMILIES.</head>
               <p>Our next scene is situated in the outskirts of a little village in Ohio. A lady
                  was seated on a sofa in the parlor, occupied with a late novel. A child of
                  eighteen months was capering noisily over the carpet.</p>
               <p>"Be still Lucy, dear, said Mrs. Welden to the little girl, who had a rattle box
                  and toy bell, with which she was making a loud noise.</p>
               <p>"O ma," said Celia Howard, Mrs. Welden's two elder<pb n="42-43"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000022"/> children, who came running into the room and
                  speaking almost together, "Mr. Mansfield's folks are coming with papa, they'll
                  soon be here."</p>
               <p>"Don't tell them so, children, they'll think you never say any one coming before."
                  said their mother in a suppressed voice. She hurriedly arranged a few scattered
                  articles about the room, and was ready immediately to receive her guests, with
                  dignity and composure.</p>
               <p>"Well, Meg," said Mr. Welden to his wife, after a pleasant conversation had been
                  carried on for some time, "we're going to Oregon that's a fact. As you need
                  'stirring up' on the subject, I thought I would invite my partner to come in with
                  his wife and daughter to animate you a little about the matter."</p>
               <p>"I think we're doing pretty well here; we ought to be contented. I shrink from the
                  very thought of the journey, in spite of all I can do."</p>
               <p>"Don't you suppose we can do whatever other folks can? Hundreds have already gone
                  to Oregon and thousands will go next summer. This new Donation Law will cause
                  thousands to go who would not otherwise undertake the journey. Six hundred and
                  forty acres of land would be worth something to a poor man."</p>
               <p>"I do not think we are so very poor. It is true we are not rich, but you are doing
                  a thriving business. You told me not two months ago that we owed no man a
                  dollar."</p>
               <p>A deep shadow crossed the usually sunny face of Mr. Welden, as the thought crossed
                  his mind for the hundredth time, that when the real state of his affairs are made
                  known to his wife, a heavy quarrel, a sick headache, and a crying fit would follow
                  as natural consequences. He lived on a neat forty acre farm joining the village
                  and was equal partner with Mr. Mansfield in a store. A heavy speculation in which
                  they had lately been engaged, suddenly failed, and the part ners were aroused to
                  the painful conviction that when arrearages were settled and creditors satisfied,
                  they would be left without capital to go ahead with their business. A conviction
                  which is too often the result of hazardous speculations risked by impatient
                  fortune seekers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mansfield, who enjoyed the full trust and confidence of his wife and daughter
                  did not hesitate a moment about telling them of the true state of his affairs, but
                  Welden dreaded to make known the fact of the failure to his wife, lest a scene
                  quite too common with them, would follow his explanations.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Welden had been brought up on a Carolina plantation. She had been the only
                  daughter of an indulgent father, and during his life time she had never know want.
                  Her father's estates, which at the time of his death were considered valuable,
                  when settled by administrators, lawyers and harpies, were squandered and reduced
                  to but little, and the proud and much petted Margaret Morrison was reduced to
                  poverty. While visiting one day at the house of a friend, some two months after
                  the settlement had been closed, she met Mr. Welden. He was attracted by her beauty
                  and moved by her recent bereavement and misfortune. She was pleased by his easy
                  manners and pleasant conversation always seasoned by an air of natural drollery.
                  The acquaintance soon ripened into intimacy, and before the close of the year they
                  were married. Mr. Welden took his bride to Ohio, where he had accumulated some
                  property while employed as head clerk in a store. He went into partnership with
                  Mr. Mansfield who had known him from boyhood and who had always felt a great
                  interest in his welfare. They prospered for several years, but times grew dull,
                  and Mrs. Welden had but little idea of the value of money. She made so many
                  depredations upon her husband's purse, that he became impatient, and induced his
                  rather reluctant partner to<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6333-00000023"/> enter with
                  him into a speculation, which, as the reader has been informed, failed, leaving
                  them with but little means of their own. The Oregon Land Law being then one of the
                  leading topics of the day, arrested their attention, and soon both Mansfield and
                  Welden resolved to engage in the enterprise of removing to the far, far West.</p>
               <p>"How will you break the news to your wife, Mansfield?" Welden said to his friend
                  after they had both decided what to do.</p>
               <p>"Why I'll just go home and kiss her, tell her I'm broke and must go to a new
                  country to begin again. She'll kiss me, say she's sorry I've been unfortunate, and
                  then say she'll do anything that I think is for the best."</p>
               <p>"I wish I could do as you say, but when I tell Meg, she'll pout and scold and say
                  I'm always doing something silly. The like of that raises any Irish blood and I'm
                  sure to say something sarcastic. I wish I had a better temper, or that Meg would
                  not provoke me so often."</p>
               <p>"The trait you speak of in your wife is a very unfortunate one, but I am half
                  inclined to believe that the fault lies in yourself as much as in her. She was
                  always petted and spoiled when a child, and the comparative adversity she has had
                  to endure since her marriage, contrasted with the life of luxurious case she led
                  in her father's house, rather tends to make her unreasonable. You should exercise
                  a great deal more forbearance with her. I have heard you tease her unmercifully
                  when you considered it excellent fun."</p>
               <p>"I rather think," said Welden ironically, "that she has as much of this world's
                  goods now, as when I married her."</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied his friend, "that is very true, but you should be careful never to
                  allude to such a thing in her presence. I don't blame her or any
                     <emph>other</emph> spirited person for not liking such allusions."</p>
               <p>"I know that I often say unpleasant things, but I will try to be more guarded in
                  future."</p>
               <p>"Well, said Mansfield, "do as I tell you; go home, kiss your wife, and make some
                  candid remarks about the state of our affairs; tell her of our misfortune, and
                  then ask her advice about going to Oregon. Treat her as a rational being, any my
                  word for it, you'll have no trouble. I would want no more pleasant occupation than
                  managing such a woman so well than she would never annoy me."</p>
               <p>The friends separated. Mansfield went home without a single misgiving about his
                  wife's acquiescence in his plans, while Welden, with a clouded brow and heavy
                  heart, beating time to bitter thoughts, walked slowly toward his dwelling.</p>
               <p>Mansfield, as he had said, had no difficulty in persuading his wife to go with him
                  in search of a new home.</p>
               <p>"Certainly, my dear, if you think it best," was her smiling reply to his
                  suggestions. He spoke of Mrs. Welder's way or treating her husband, and of his
                  apprehensions concerning the disclosure of the business failure, adding that Mr.
                  Welden had expressed a wish that Mrs. Mansfield would call upon his wife and exert
                  her influence to awaken her to a sense of duty.</p>
               <p>"That's just what we will do pa," said Ada, a gipsey-complected girl of seventeen
                  summers, who was full enough of vivacity and excitement to be always ready to
                  embrace any project provided it was new or strange.</p>
               <p>"Very well, pet, we will do as you say," and Mr. Mansfield left his pleasant home
                  to look after his business for the reminder of the forenoon. He reached the store
                  just as Welder, who had been absent on a similar errand, entered to doorway.</p>
               <p>"How did your wife receive the intelligence you went home to communicate?"
                  Mansfield asked as soon as they were seated.</p>
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6333-00000024"/>
               <p>"The first thing she said after I stepped in the house was, that she must have a
                  new sofa and carpet this very week. She was going to give a large New Year's
                  party, and the parlor must be fitted up becomingly. This damped my spirits and I
                  know I looked vexed. I could'nt help it. I told her that funds were scarce and I
                  did not see how we were to give a party. She flared up at this, and said I was
                  always making a poor mouth. I kept my temper remarkably well, and thinking it best
                  to come to the point, I told her that I wanted to start to Oregon in the spring,
                  and spoke of the advantages of securing a fortune in a new country, until she
                  became interested, but I did not dare to speak of the business failure lest she'd
                     <emph>blow me sky high,</emph>" be added with a bitter laugh.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Mansfield and Ada are going to all upon Mrs. Welden this afternoon, and I
                  promised to accompany them. I believe that if Ada were left to herself she would
                  soon get your wife into a perfect fever to cross the Plains. She is s vivacious
                  and enthusiastic that her animated talk will do more to reconcile her to our
                  plans, than all our sage reasonings can accomplish. Call round and dine with us
                  and we will go together to your house."</p>
               <p>The interview with Welden and his wife had passed much as he had stated in to his
                  friend. After her husband left the house she indulged in a fit of weeping for a
                  half hour. Then taking up a late French novel, she buried her disordered thoughts
                  in its contents. Welden usually dined at the tavern on business days, and Mrs.
                  Welden always ate cold dinners. She had become so deeply interested in the novel
                  that her dinner, as well as the morning's conversation between herself and husband
                  was forgotten when her guests arrived.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Welden was graceful and petite in figure. Her countenance, when in good humor
                  was pleasing, almost fascinating. A haughty bearing of the beautiful head and
                  elastic frame, caused her to appear the very personification of pride and
                  haughtiness. The worst thing that could be said of her was that no one
                     <emph>understood</emph> her. Her control of her children was truly commendable.
                  They all possessed the fun-loving, mischievous propensities of their father, who
                  left the management of them entirely to his wife. She seldom spoke a cross word to
                  them, but the reins of government in her hands were held so firmly that her
                  children never thought of disobeying her commands. She was generally affable
                  before company, and Welden always communicated unpleasant news to her when company
                  was present, so that the effervesence of her ill humor might find a hidden vent
                  through which to exhaust itself before they would be left alone. One peculiarity
                  of her disposition was that she could not generally remain angry long at a time, a
                  trait of her character with which her husband was well acquainted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Welden's keen black eyes sparkled continually with merriment, unless he was
                  angry or excited, and then the light from them beamed in successive flashes. Every
                  person he met was in danger of his ready wit, but his sarcastic jokes were more
                  frequently inflicted upon his wife than any one else. No doubt, as Mansfield had
                  told him, these oft-repeated jokes at her expense was the main cause of the
                  pettishness and ill humor she exhibited towards him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mansfield's well proportioned figure, pleasing countenance, and auburn curls,
                  contrasted with the jetty braids, lustrous eyes, and stout, well rounded form of
                  his wife, made him almost look girlish. He had stepped into the shady side of
                  forty, but no one would have pronounced him past twenty-eight, at the
                  farthest.</p>
               <p>Ada loved to look proudly at her father, and tell of the times he had been
                  mistaken for a beau of hers by her friends. She possessed the elastic figure of
                  her father combined with the brunette complexion of her mother. "I<pb n="48-49"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000025"/> have known such things to happen" she began, "as
                  husbands and fathers getting their business so enthralled that it has been
                  necessary for them to break up and begin business in a new country. From what Pa
                  said this morning, I believe he and Mr. Welden are in a tight place for money. If
                  they could sell out, settle up, and have means enough left to take us to a new
                  country, we could begin anew, choose our own locations, get rich, and some day
                  surprise the rustic inhabitants of Rockville, by coming to see them with gold
                  enough in our possession to buy the town."</p>
               <p>"But our husbands are not enthralled in their business?</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Welden cast a look of anxious inquiry towards her husband as the probable
                  truth flashed across her mind.</p>
               <p>He replied hesitatingly. "Yes, Meggie, the immense drove of hogs we sent to
                  Baltimore, reached their place of destination just as the late thaw commenced. As
                  thaws and freezes rule the price of pork, we did not get first cost on the hogs.
                  The expense of transportation was so heavy that when all arrearages are paid, the
                  store will go to "Davy Jones."</p>
               <p>No matter how important Welden's conversation or communication was, he always
                  ended with a ludicrous phrase as an offset to his previous sage expression.</p>
               <p>"Ah, well! if that's the way matters stand, we had better sell out ad go," said
                  his wife, now fully aroused to a sense of duty. She possessed a heart behind her
                  practical selfishness, which when fully aroused and rightly moved was capable of
                  developing sensible and wife-like actions.—</p>
               <p>The consent of all parties being gained, the conversation was changed to
                  conjectures respecting teams, waggons, provisions and other necessary articles
                  connected with a long journey.</p>
               <p>A gentleman was ushered into the parlor by a servant.</p>
               <p>"Why, Maurice Stanton," Welden exclaimed, as he grasped his hand right
                  cordially.</p>
               <p>Maurice had a pleasant word for all, and soon a lively chat about the current news
                  of the day, in which the ladies joined with interest, chased, for a time, all
                  visions of journeyings from the mind of every one</p>
               <p>"What is the doctor driving at now?" Mansfield asked, as soon as he could find a
                  long enough pause in the conversation to ask the question.</p>
               <p>"Practicing medicine as usual."</p>
               <p>"You have graduated, have you not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but I never expect to practice as a physician."</p>
               <p>"Why not?"</p>
               <p>"I am going west to Oregon or California, where people don't die and then I'll be
                  at liberty."</p>
               <p>"What does your father think of such a scheme?"</p>
               <p>"He thinks he can't help himself, I guess. Thanks to the twenty-two past years, I
                  am my own man now. Though I am very sorry to disobey my father, yet I can't bear
                  the tought of following in his wake and spending my life with a paid of
                  saddle-bags in my hand, ready at any moment to run at every body's call. The
                  doctor says I shall have no somebody's team across the Plains, and work for money
                  in the mines."</p>
               <p>"I believe Providence has sent you here, if that is the case, for we were speaking
                  just as you came in about getting some one to drive my ox team," said Welden.</p>
               <p>"O, you are always joking so that no one knows when to believe you. Can you prove
                  that by Mr. Mansfield? He is old and steady and never speaks in jest as you do,"
                  laughed Maurice.</p>
               <p>"I have made up my mind to cease jesting and talk in<pb n="50-51"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000026"/> earnest for the rest of my life. I guess Meg won't
                  be sorry if I stick to that resolution."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Mansfield, is it a fact that Welden thinks of crossing the Plains?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and that is not all,—I'm going too."</p>
               <p>"I'am just in town then, provided. I can get a situation with either of you as ox
                  driver."</p>
               <p>"There is an Irishman at my house, who will drive my team. Welden's the man to
                  talk to you."</p>
               <p>An arrangement was soon agreed upon between the two, and Maurice, after an hour's
                  pleasant conversation, left the house in company with Ada. Mr. and Mrs. Mansfield
                  had gone home some tome before. Ada promised to call in often, and left the house,
                  feeling that she had done some good in helping to open the eyes of Mrs. Welden to
                  a true state of their affairs.</p>
               <p>Maurice Stanton's dark hair, hazel eyes, and thoughtful brow, were shown off to
                  good advantage by a faultless mouth, that was always ready to break into a smile.
                  His Manly carriage, musical voice, and affability of manners, made him a general
                  favorite with ladies who had perceptive faculties sufficient to enable them to
                  discern his depth of intellect, while the numerous class of women, young and old,
                  who could only e charmed by simpered compliments and silly nothings, soon tired of
                  his company.</p>
               <p>Dr. Stanton was an eminent physician of Cincinnati.—He wished his son to follow
                  the same beaten path, and had educated him with that intention, but Maurice had
                  not taste for the profession. He possessed an enthusiastic love for adventure, aud
                  had a strong desire to emigrate to the distant West, in search of hidden treasure,
                  or, as he said, "after any thing in his line," which meant anything exciting or
                  exhilarating. Welden observed to his wife, that "he always thought that those who
                  needed help in match-making were not worth the trouble for, but," said he, "I
                  really believe that if Maurice Stanton and Ada Mansfield were to get married, it
                  would be an advantage to them both."</p>
               <p>"Not always, John. You have not known them always."</p>
               <p>"Well; for a year or two past I've thought of it often," he replied.</p>
               <p>Arrangements were made to suit both families for a removal in the spring. We will
                  leave them to transact their business unmolested by us, while we pass over the
                  next three or four months, to take a peep at the Goodwins, Grays, and Greens, and
                  see them started on their long and wearisome journey.</p>

               <p>WINTER had passed away. Balmy, dreamlike days succeeded the colds and snows of the
                  past three weary months. Though the tempests, as if at times determined not to
                  yield the conquest to mild zephyrs and genial sunshine, would break forth in angry
                  howls, or deluge the moist earth with fresh showers of chilling rain, yet 'twas
                  but winter's death struggle. It seemed as if the gay throng of returning birds
                  were warbling forth the snow's last requiem, as they collected together in groups
                  among the budding branches of maple, elm and locust trees.</p>
               <p>By the first of April, all were ready to leave their native homes and undertake
                  the toilsome pilgrimage over rolling prairies, mountainous wastes and desert
                  sands, in search of a new home beyond the fastnesses of the Oregon mountains.</p>
               <p>By disposing of her little property and the watch which was<pb n="52-53"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000027"/> not parted with without many tears, Mrs. Goodwin
                  was enabled to fit up comfortably for the journey and have money left, with which
                  to defray travelling expenses. The company had six waggons: two for farmer Gray,
                  two for daddy Green, one for Sam and Polly, and one for Mrs. Goodwin's family.</p>
               <p>A pleasant looking set of wagons were theirs, each with a "bran-new" cover, fitted
                  neatly over the arching bows.—A happy looking line of fat cattle was attached to
                  each vehicle, and as they walked lazily along chewing their cuds with perfect
                  contentment, how little did they know of the many trials, strains, pulls and
                  starvings that were in store for them during the coming six months. A half dozen
                  cows were driven along by Jed, who rode the little mule. Jake and Billy, two boys
                  of daddy Green's, who were younger than Sam, took charge of the baggage wagons.
                  The road, for the first two miles after leaving Farmer Gray's homestead was
                  described in a former chapter.</p>
               <p>A continuous halloa of "Who-haw-Buck! Get along Bright! Gee Berry!" and the slow
                  but steady tread of two dozen pairs of oxen, brought them at last in sight of Mrs.
                  Goodwin's former home. She had heard that great changes had been made in the
                  appearance of the cottage and grounds around it, but was not prepared to witness
                  so complete a destruction of shrubbery. The sweet-briers, roses, lilacs and all
                  the accompanying ornaments of the widow's delightful little home had been
                  ruthlessly destroyed. No snowy curtains adorned the windows, no sweet scented
                  vines climbed around the rude door-way.</p>
               <p>A half dozen dirty, obstreperous boys were running here and there over the yard,
                  apparently bent upon destroying the last vestige of the beauty of by-gone
                  days.</p>
               <p>The train halted when within a short distance of the gate, and the company agreed
                  to wait until Mrs. Goodwin and her children could make a call at the house.</p>
               <p>"I'll not go in there, mother, to be insulted by Ike Hammond. You can do as you
                  choose, but I prefer the company of the cattle," said Herbert.</p>
               <p>"I'm not going in to see the folks," replied his mother, "but I want to see the
                  inside of my dear little home once more. Come Effie and Willie, let's go."</p>
               <p>As they passed through the open gate, the children stared at them as though the
                  appearance of a stranger within their gates, was something very unusual.</p>
               <p>"Good morning, Mrs. Hammond."</p>
               <p>The object of humanity thus addressed, stared at them vacantly for half a minute,
                  and offered them some rude seats, apologized for the disorderly arrangement of
                  things in general, as such women always do, and seemed disposed to treat them with
                  civility.</p>
               <p>"We're mighty busy just now. Ike's a goin' to build a still house on the branch,
                  an' it'll keep us a kickin' to git things ready afore harvest."</p>
               <p>"Halloa, mother, it's time for us to be travelling," called Herbert, in a hurried
                  tone.</p>
               <p>Effie and Willie gave a hasty look at the well known objects around the yard and
                  garden before going with their mother to the road. They were ready to get into the
                  wagon, when Hammond came up, reeled around the foremost oxen, and came neat to
                  where Herbert was standing. He remarked with a sneer, that he hoped they'd had a
                  pleasant call at his house.</p>
               <p>"Madam, don't you think you ought to pay me for the use of my farm, during the
                  four years you lived upon it?"</p>
               <p>"I perceive that you have no shame whatever, for yourself, sir, but I assure you
                  sir, I am very much ashamed of your conduct. I hope God will forgive you as freely
                  as I do."</p>
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6333-00000028"/>
               <p>"God! Who's He? I'd like to know. You may talk as much about <emph>God</emph> as
                  you please, but you'll have to show Him to me before you'll stuff that down this
                  child."</p>
               <p>"I say ye <emph>scamp!</emph>" said Farmer Gray, coming up to Hammond, with his
                  shirt sleeves rolled to the elbows, "if ye don't let this lady along, I'll beat
                  yer brains out, in less' an no time."</p>
               <p>"I've nothing against the woman, but if that scapegrace of a boy was black, I'd
                  buy him, if I had to barter my father's bones to make the first payment. Would'nt
                  I like to make him bite the dirt?"</p>
               <p>"Another word, sir, an' I'll <emph>limb</emph> ye! I'll allow no drunken wretch to
                  abuse an unprotected woman an' children, when I am about;" and Farmer Gray cast a
                  significant look at his son-in-law Sam, as much as to say, "you ought to show the
                     <emph>pluck,</emph>" a word that he used to signify courage or resolution.</p>
               <p>"Come, Herbert, drive on dear," said his mother calmly. With loud cracks of the
                  whips, combined with merry whistling of the drivers as they walked through the
                  mud, the train moved slowly on.</p>
               <p>The first encampment was in an open prairie, between Peoria and Farmington. The
                  novelty of getting supper in the open air; the frequent mistakes made by cooks in
                  their first attempts at campers, and the dry jokes of Farmer Gray who was always
                  ready and waiting for an opportunity to raise a laugh upon the most awkward,
                  afforded a great deal of merriment.</p>
               <p>The day's excitement kept Mrs. Goodwin awake until a late hour. She was surrounded
                  by kind hearted, but coarse associates, whose highest ambitions was to have plenty
                  of cows an horses, farms and tobacco. What was there inviting in the prospect of
                  having to mingle exclusively with such a class of persons? Would not her children
                  form coarse tastes and imbibe merely practical habits and ideas?</p>
               <p>It was her highest aim to bring forth the <emph>ideal</emph> of every thing in her
                  children. While she was careful to instruct them in every practical branch of
                  business which she imagined it necessary for them to know, the great purpose of
                  her life was to teach them to consider the works of Nature as their great
                  instructor, and to look from Nature up to the great creator.</p>
               <p>The dawn revealed a light fall of snow that covered the ground, but the air was
                  pleasant, and after a hurried breakfast, all were ready for the day's travel. They
                  were subjected to numerous and sometimes needles delay, and were fourteen days
                  upon the road from Peoria to Quincy. Here, the wagons were stopped for a few hours
                  in one of the principal streets of the city. When the necessary purchases were
                  made, and boys' curiosity satisfied, they moved on to the blanks of the
                  Mississippi. The tents were spread upon some flat rocks near the water's edge, in
                  a place overlooking the river, where the high bluffs presented a general view of
                  the flourishing and beautiful city. The women and children were sitting in the
                  shade, enjoying the cool river breeze, looking at the different floating objects
                  of interest upon the river, and listening to the busy hum of city life, when a
                  mammoth boat was seen moving majestically upon the placid bosom of the silvery
                  stream. To our rustic Illinoisians, who had always been used to boats made to suit
                  their river, this beautiful vessel, as she proudly plowed the waters, appeared
                  like a floating, fairy castle. The shrill, annoying whistle which escaped her
                  pipes, as she stopped alongside the wharf, almost deafened the listeners in the
                  tents, all of whom, except Mrs. Goodwin had always been living in the interior of
                  some one of the western states.</p>
               <p>Among the numerous passengers who emerged from the vessel, was one company that
                  attracted their particular attention. There were three grown ladies; two of them
                     dressed<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6333-00000029"/> for travelling, in Bloomer
                  style. They wore leghorn hats, trimmed in broad, green ribbons and heavy plumes.
                  The third lady, whose short, stout figure would have looked ridiculous in
                  Bloomers, was attired in a dark plaid travelling dress and <hi rend="i"/>berage
                  sun bonnet. There were three rosy-cheeked, sprightly appearing young children,
                  whose neatness and good behaviour was attractive and pleasing. The ladies and
                  children stepped upon the wharf, and as soon as the crowd dispersed a little,
                  Mansfield and Welden came off the boat, each leading a span of large, fine mules,
                  attached to comfortable and substantial family carriages. The travellers had
                  scarcely time to glance around them before a half dozen runners, from as many
                  different hotels, came up to them, each trying to out-talk the other.</p>
               <p>"Good accommodations at the Union Hotel, sir; best in the city; you'd better go
                  with me."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Ourn's</emph> the best house in town! Board for three dollars a week!
                  children half price!"</p>
               <p>They were used to scenes of this kind and paid but little attention to the
                  impertinent throng. Mrs. Gray, Mrs. Sam Green, and Mrs. Green looked on in
                  astonishment.</p>
               <p>"The la me!" said Mrs. Gray, getting excited, "I don't see why the gentlemen don't
                  knock down the impudent rascals. My old man would <emph>I</emph> know." Mr. Welden
                  knew by the appearance of the wagons belonging to the campers, that they were,
                  like himself, bound for a trip over the Plains, and asked his companions to
                  accompany him to their tents.</p>
               <p>After a mutual introduction all round, Mrs. Goodwin offered them some low seats of
                  trunks and boxes that were always taken from the wagons after halting, to serve
                  the purpose of chairs.</p>
               <p>"Well, Effie, I hope you'll find an agreeable associate in Ada," said Mansfield,
                  glancing towards his daughter with fraternal ternal pride and fondness, while he
                  patted Effie's head as she was sitting beside him and his daughter.</p>
               <p>"Whatever she can learn from your daughter, or from any of your company, that will
                  be beneficial to her, will be thankfully received," said Mrs. Goodwin.</p>
               <p>"I'm very glad, Madam, that we have fallen in company with you, and I doubt not
                  but that we shall agree perfectly in most things, while we are travelling
                  together."</p>
               <p>When the men and boys who had been off for a few hours with the cattle returned,
                  two other men were with them, Patrick O'Donaldson, Mansfield's ox driver, and
                  Maurice Stanton, who performed that interesting service for Welden, were
                  introduced to the uninitiated.</p>
               <p>Effie offered Maurice the seat she had occupied by Ada's side upon a trunk, and
                  the gleam of satisfaction that kindled in his eye, as he accepted the place, did
                  not escape her observation.</p>
               <p>The Illinoisians were well pleased with their new acquaintances. Welden amused by
                  his wit, Maurice instructed by his conversation, Mansfield enlivened by his
                  pleasant stories, and the Irishman, Pat O'Donaldson, made fun for all by his
                  grotesque actions and comic remarks, spoken in the virgin dialect of the "Ould
                  Counthry."</p>
               <p>The ladies, excepting Mrs. Welden, proved equally agreeable. Her manner repelled
                  all attempts at intimacy, Mrs. Gray remarked to Mrs. Green, that "the woman
                  appears good lookin' enough to be shore, but she needn't feel so <emph>stuck
                     up</emph> about it! Beauty's only skin deep." They all noticed that Celia,
                  Howard and Lucy were perfect models of good behavior. They cared nothing for their
                  father's commands, but a word or look from "ma," was all that was necessary to
                  make them obedient.</p>
               <p>"No wonder they mind her," said Farmer Gray, "she'd chill a fire-coal to an icicle
                  by looking at it!"</p>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6333-00000030"/>
               <p>When Mrs. Goodwin disposed herself upon her bed that lovely April night, it was
                  with pleasant feelings that she contemplated the future. She felt that her prayers
                  had been in a measure answered, for her children were to have some intelligent
                  company through the weary six months' trial, she so much dreaded.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <head type="sub">CAPTAIN GRAY.</head>
               <p>THE COMPANY had lain by for two days at Quincy. On a bright, clear morning, when
                  the rising sun shed his golden beams upon the city house-tops, and gilded the
                  placid river with a transparent radience, they prepared to cross the peaceful
                  surface of the Father of Waters. The rains and thaws of returning spring, and
                  caused the river to overflow the low banks on the Missouri side, and Lagrange,
                  seven miles from Quincy, was the nearest practicable landing place.</p>
               <p>Farmer Gray had been elected Captain by a unanimous vote. The business of making
                  the bargains devolved upon him; and certainly no better man could have been chosen
                  for the office. They had got almost to Lagrange, when wishing to pay up and save
                  time, he offered the boat captain the sum he had agreed before starting, to pay
                  him for talking them over the river. A misunderstanding about the sum to be paid
                  arose, and as Captain Gray was obstinate and certain that he only was right,
                  saying that he knew better than any one else did about the exact sum, the boat
                  captain gave orders to his men to go back and land them at Quincy. The boat began
                  to back and turn about, and the ladies, who were on the lookout from the cabin,
                  were surprised to see Lagrange receding and the beautiful city of Quincy appearing
                  nearer every moment. Mansfield and Welden urged their obstinate commander to give
                  the required sum and let them go on, but he shook his head and said, "Old Gray
                  knows what he's about. I wern't born yesterday, <emph>I</emph> wern't."</p>
               <p>When they again came to Quincy, the owner of the boat was summoned, who decided
                  that Captain Gray was right, and with a satisfactory chuckle, as he rubbed his
                  hands together, he ordered the boat captain, who winced under his severe scrutiny,
                  "to try it again an' see if ye can't act more like a gentleman the next heat."</p>
               <p>"Now, sir, I'll charge ye five dollars for this detention. Ye see, we're so
                  belated by yer greediness, that we won't be able to make the timber afore campin'
                  time, an' there's no fun in havin' to turn in, on a raw night, without havin' a
                  fire to warm our shins and cook our fodder."</p>
               <p>The captain, who evidently began to think himself rather uncomfortably situated,
                  exclaimed, "Well, now, that's too bad; for if you knew what kind of a man my boss
                  is, you wouldn't blame I know."</p>
               <p>"Why? what kind of a man is he? He acted the gentleman with Captain Gray, when you
                  tried to act the rascal," said Mansfield involuntarily.</p>
               <p>"By the Howly Murther! an' its no fault of his'n, if he didn't succade nayther,"
                  added Pat O'Donaldson.</p>
               <p>"My boss would steal an acorn from a blind hog, if he thought he could sell it for
                  a farthing."</p>
               <p>"Ah, well," said Captain Gray, ironically, "ye can't prove that, an' ye'd as well
                  fork over. Or stay, I'll take a cord of yer good split wood, if yer men'll toat it
                  off the boat. I'm amazin' easy with ye, but as we won't be apt to meet again for
                  awhile, I guess I'll let ye off."</p>
               <p>The difficulty was thus settled, and with each family's<pb n="60-61"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000031"/> share of "night wood," projecting conspicuously
                  from under the front bows of the wagons, they prepared to go through Lagrange. The
                  women and children trudged along on foot, as Welden said to give the timber a
                  chance to ride."</p>
               <p>"I say, Meg, we're in for it now. Aren't you glad we've come? This is such fun,"
                  said he amusingly to his wife, who was toil somely picking her way through the
                  mud, in no very enviable humor. He was on his knees in the front part of the
                  carriage, which had been filled with sundry bulky articles from the wagons, in
                  order to make room for the annoying but necessary supply of fuel. Little Lucy was
                  crowded into a small space beside her father, near the carriage dashboard. Mrs.
                  Welden looked at her fun-loving husband, as he sat in the carriage with the lines
                  and ship in his hands, and answered him petulenty.</p>
               <p>"Just pass your compliments upon some one else if you please. Perhaps a person of
                  intelligence would appreciate them more than I do."</p>
               <p>"I don't know, I think my Meg wouldn't love me if I didn't do something to make
                  myself interesting."</p>
               <p>The provokingly mischievous husband brought down his heavy whip-lash with such
                  force into a puddle which his wife was trying to avoid, that the dirty water was
                  thrown into her face and over her dress, completely saturating her hat and
                  clothing with the murky liquid.</p>
               <p>"Never mind, wifey, I'll throw this naughty whip away, if it doesn't do better.
                  It's a shame to see your clothes abused in that manner."</p>
               <p>"I'll cut a pretty figure walking through town! I wish you had to flounder in such
                  a puddle for a life time. Hogs <emph>will</emph> play in mud-holes," she retorted,
                  as she shook her muddy Bloomer suit.</p>
               <p>"O, well, you can just tell the folks that you're Mrs. Welden's den's darkie,
                  that'll do," he replied, pretending not to notice her last retort.</p>
               <p>His wife knew that when once fairly out upon the sea of fun and satire, no matter
                  how she replied, he would get from bad to worse, until she could get out of his
                  way, so she went back to where Ada was walking, and contrived to get out of the
                  reach of his uncomfortable and practical jokes.</p>
               <p>The teams halted in front of a hotel, and while the men were making purchases,
                  which at every town appeared indispensable, the women and children paid a visit to
                  some negro huts, where there were three ebony-colored women, each with an infant
                  in her arms. Effie and Willie had never before seen a negro baby, and were much
                  interested with their shining eyes and woolly heads. Tears came to Mrs. Welden's
                  eyes.</p>
               <p>"Hannah, do you know me."</p>
               <p>"Wy, b'ess my soul, Miss Meggie! Po'r lamb, what be you doin' heah?"</p>
               <p>The company looked on in astonishment. A large, muscular black woman, with
                  protuberent lips, shining eyes, and ivory teeth, woolly head, salted over with
                  flecks of grey, and a dress of blue drilling, worn into shreds, was certainly a
                  not very inviting object to look upon; but Mrs. Welden flew to her embrace, and
                  mingled her sobs and tears with the alternate groans and exclamations of delight
                  of the black woman.</p>
               <p>"Who brought you here, Hannah?"</p>
               <p>"Massa Harris. He said the South didn't suit him, an' moved up heah. My dear, po'r
                  lamb, whar have you been all dese yeahs?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Welden told the story with which the reader has become acquainted.</p>
               <p>"O, if you could buy me! Dear chile, I'd sarve my life out at
                     <emph>anything</emph> if you'd take me!"</p>
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6333-00000032"/>
               <p>"My poor nurse! if I had the means to purchase you, or could get the money in any
                  honest way, you should never leave me again."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Welden sobbed violently. She was in the arms of a servant who had been her
                  mother's nurse, and taken the whole charge of her in childhood. After her father's
                  death, Hannah had been sold to a trader, and Mrs. Welden had never heard from her
                  since the sale. Memory rushed away at full speed, and brought in array before her
                  the happy days of departed childhood, sweet visions of a gentle mother, whom she
                  could just remember, and the fond face of an indulgent father, who had lived to
                  see her grown.</p>
               <p>"An' you couldn't buy me?"</p>
               <p>"O, Hannah, its impossible."</p>
               <p>"They're calling us at the wagon's, mamma," said Effie. Mrs. Welden tore herself
                  away from the arms of her beloved old nurse, whose exclamations of sorrow thrilled
                  the breasts of the listeners, and walked hurriedly towards the carriage.</p>
               <p>"O, John, I've seen my old nurse! You can't think how badly I hate to leave
                  her!"</p>
               <p>"So you've been to see your ebony sisters and want to stay with them do you? You
                  know you were to pass for Mrs. Welden's darkie in town. They were willing to claim
                  you, eh?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Welden bridled up. "No, sir, they were not! They said that no 'spec'able man
                  would keep his niggers lookin' that dirty, an' they wouldn't 'sociate with collud
                  pussons what wur'nt 'spec'able."</p>
               <p>"I guess yer wife's headed ye this time," laughed Sam Green, who, as his wagon was
                  next in order to Welden's carriage, had heard all their conversation. A general
                  laugh followed Sam's remark, and as they moved slowly on to the Lagrangians must
                  be glad we're going."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Welden was morose and sullen. Her husband's unkind thoughtlessness, at a time
                  when she needed his sympathy so much, wounded her feelings. She felt that he had
                  no right to make sport of her earnest joy in meeting with her old nurse. Her pride
                  was wounded too, by his allusions to her "ebony sisters," and she determined to
                  spite him by being cross and unreasonable in turn. Ada tried hard to engage her
                  sympathy, but for several days, she repelled her sisterly advances with haughty
                  dignity.</p>
               <p>The first private opportunity that Mansfield could get to do so, he preached a
                  severe homily to Welden about his unreasonable practical jokes, and reminded him
                  of the promise he had made to give up such actions and words for the future. He
                  acknowledged that he had done wrong, and secretly resolved to make amends for his
                  misdemeanor by an humble apology.</p>
               <p>"It's a regular form of abuse," continued Mansfield. "Don't come to me again with
                  a pitiful story about what your wife says and does that is unreasonable. You are
                  not to be pitied if she does sometimes give you trouble."</p>
               <p>After leaving Lagrange, the train moved on for about a mile, and encamped close to
                  a dancing, rippling little brook, whose gleesome waters contribute their mite
                  towards swelling the current of the Mississippi. <q>
                     <l>"Ere the first gray streak of dawn,"</l>
                  </q> the Captain's trumpet aroused the sleeping travellers.—After the usual
                  morning preparation and bustle, they took up the line of march and journeyed on,
                  tediously through mud and sloughs, and over hills and rocks, through a barren and
                  thinly populated portion of Missouri; occasionally passing through little towns,
                  sometimes ferrying streams, now crossing lovely prairies, anon pursuing their
                  toilsome way through dense forests and dismal thickets of underbrush, until the
                  fourth of May, when they emerged from a wood<pb n="64-65"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000033"/> and found themselves in an open plain, in the
                  outskirts of St. Josephs, where they began to prepare in god earnest for the
                  journey that was scarcely yet begun. Provisions were packed; all heavy articles
                  thrown away that could be dispensed with; mules were shod and wagons repaired, and
                  on the tenth of May, they were ready to again march on.</p>
               <p>They crossed the turbid waters of the Missouri, and moved on about six miles, to a
                  pleasant camping ground. The scenery around the camp was lovely in the extreme.
                  Successive ranges of rolling hills, covered with green verdure, stretched away as
                  far as the eye could discern, towards the north and south. Groves of newly mantled
                  timber here and there covered the gentlest eminences. Wild flowers serene in their
                  calm beauty and loveliness, bloomed on the rolling plain, and loaded the air of
                  the secluded dells with an alluring fragrance. Herds of noble horses, droves of
                  cattle, and flocks of sheep, <emph>corraled</emph> by multitudes of attendants,
                  were luxuriating upon the rich herbage of the beauteous spring time. Smoke from a
                  hundred camp fires was wafted by gentle zephyrs from the exposed hill sides, and
                  played and settled without disturbance in the sheltered dales. The sun, as if well
                  pleased with the beauty of the scene, sank behind the horizon as though he longed
                  for slumber.</p>
               <p>The evening work was done. Those of Captain Gray's Company who were inclined to
                  indulge in reverie, strolled out from camp for a season of quiet meditation. Ada
                  and Effie climbed to the summit of one of the highest hills and took a farewell
                  view of St. Joseph and the Missouri river. Effie tripped away to gather flowers,
                  and Ada seated herself beneath a cluster of cottonwoods. She watched the various
                  objects of beauty and interest with mingled emotions of pleasure and sadness. She
                  was happy in viewing the works of the Creator in their regal splendor, and sad,
                  when she thought of the home she had left, the absent friends she loved, and the
                  associations of childhood. Her's was no common nature. The mind, deep in its
                  excellence was often hidden by the sunny riffles that played over her features,
                  and the wild, artless prattle of her general conversation. She was impulsive,
                  agreeable, witty, and energetic; every body agreed to that; but prudes shook their
                  heads, and cautious, hypocritical mammas charged their daughters to beware when in
                  her company. She was <emph>wild!</emph> That awful stigma, upon which the
                  character of many a young girl has been tossed, was attached by the envious to her
                  name on all occasions. Because she would ape nobody's manners, was blithe frank in
                  her conversation with those of the opposite as well as her own sex, fearless in
                  maintaining her own opinions, and somewhat excitable in temperament, many, who
                  would gladly have possessed her tact and intellect, turned away, propheeying evil
                  in her future pathway. Her heart, the well-spring of a maiden's existence, no one
                  but her parents rightly judged; and the "deep within the deep," in the chambers of
                  her spirit, <emph>they</emph> had never sounded.</p>
               <p>She had been strangely agitated of late in more ways than one. Maurice, she had
                  become convinced, was every day growing more attached to her. She felt that his
                  manly affection was no trifling matter. They were both poor—that was the greatest
                  trouble. Her parents were proud of her, and desired that in forming a matrimonial
                  alliance, she would look for excellence and riches combined.</p>
               <p>She sat gazing with an abstracted air upon the velvet turf and did not notice that
                  the subject of her reverie was coming until he stood before her.</p>
               <p>She invited him to sit upon the green sward.</p>
               <p>"Ada, what makes you look so sad? Is not everything in nature charming enough to
                  drive away dull melancholy?"</p>
               <p>"I am not unhappy, Maurice. I was thinking very deeply, and I suppose my
                  countenance betrayed the fact."</p>
               <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6333-00000034"/>
               <p>"Would you tell a friend what has been the subject of your meditations?"</p>
               <p>It was a home question. She replied without looking up: "One thing that makes me
                  feel sorrowful, is the thought of the home and friends I have left behind me. When
                  I turn my eyes in the direction of my former home, a kind of indescribable
                  melancholy takes possession of my being. I often wonder if other folks think and
                  feel as I do about such things."</p>
               <p>"This feeling is quite natural to those who have a good degree of ideality."</p>
               <p>"I believe that I have more than my share of inhabitiveness."</p>
               <p>"Tell me, Ada, is there not some image enshrined upon your heart that makes you
                  sigh for the absent?"</p>
               <p>"No," said she, decidedly. "It is not <emph>one</emph> friend, but
                     <emph>many,</emph> whom I used to love, that I think of when alone."</p>
               <p>"Has no one yet unclasped the love fountains of your heart?"</p>
               <p>"What right have you to ask me?"</p>
               <p>"Do you believe that I would ask you such a question, if I had no motive but
                  curiosity?"</p>
               <p>She raised her eyes, intending to throw out some witty remark, but when she met
                  his earnest gaze, a tell-tale blush overspread her face, and she was silent.</p>
               <p>Maurice grasped her hand.</p>
               <p>"May I hope that I will one day win your regard and prove myself worthy of
                  it?"</p>
               <p>"When I get to Oregon, I will tell you," she replied.</p>
               <p>It was growing dark and they arose to go to camp, when Effie came to them with a
                  handful of blue-bells she had gathered in a shady grotto. Maurice talked and
                  laughed with her as with a little child. Her prattle and glee amused him.</p>
               <p>"<emph>You'll</emph> soon be old enough to be in love, my beauty," said he, in
                  reply to an insinuation of hers about the tete-a-tete under the cotton woods.</p>
               <p>"Don't you believe it. I don't believe I've got any heart to love anything but
                  birds and flowers and all such pretty things, always excepting my mother and
                  brothers. Now men aren't pretty and I don't like them at all," she said, tossing a
                  wreath of grass and blue-bells into the air. She then danced away, to the music of
                  her own light heart, towards the camping ground.</p>
               <p>"No wonder everybody loves her," said Maurice; "she has a hidden nature, that if
                  rightly developed, would make her an extraordinary woman."</p>
               <p>The moon had arisen in her pale beauty, and the couple walked on, conversing in a
                  quiet tone, when they overtook Effie, who had espied some rare flowers, radiating
                  in the moonbeams. She was sitting upon the turf with a handful of wild primroses
                  in her lap, and looking from their lovely petals towards the others that grew
                  around her in luxuriant profusion.</p>
               <p>"What now, birdie?" Ada asked.</p>
               <p>"I was comparing these flowers in imagination with those that bloomed a year ago
                  in our garden."</p>
               <p>A truce to old regrets, my beauty, and success to all new enterprises," said
                  Maurice, patting her curly head.</p>
               <p>Wishing to divert her mind from melancholy thoughts, he began to explain the
                  different botanical properties of the primrose.</p>
               <p>"I don't know why it is," she interrupted, "that I care so little for anything
                  that is scientific. I often get ashamed of my dislike for science. I'd like to
                  know everything, but I hate the trouble of learning."</p>
               <p>"Time will work wonders with you, birdie," said Ada.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE TRIUMPH.</head>
               <p>ON THE dewy grass, out of sight and hearing of the numerous campers, knelt a
                  fragile form. Now she would raise her voice in audible petitions to the great All
                  Father; again her murmurs would sink to inaudible whispers, and anon convulsive
                  sobs would shake her frame. She wrestled thus with the communings of her clouded
                  spirit until <emph>light,</emph> as an unction from on High, pervaded her being.
                  Subdued and tranquil, she arose from the posture of supplication, and gazed with
                  beaming eyes, upon the myriads of stars that were floating in the vaulted heavens.
                  Again, she knelt upon the turf, and prayed for wisdom, grace and guidance, from
                  the bounteous Giver of needful blessings.</p>
               <p>"Where is Meg? I wonder," said Welden to Mrs. Goodwin, who was holding little
                  Lucy, and singing a soothing lullaby to the little innocent, who missed her mother
                  and refused to be comforted.</p>
               <p>"She asked me to see to Lucy while she was taking a walk. I have not seen her for
                  half an hour."</p>
               <p>"Which way did she go?"</p>
               <p>"She crossed the rivulet and started towards yonder hillock. I believe she went
                  beyond it."</p>
               <p>Welden went in quest of his wife, and found her praying, with an eloquence that
                  surprised—unmanned him. He went close enough to her to hear the deep breathings of
                  her tried spirit; and as he listened to the supplications of the wife of his
                  bosom, in behalf of himself and their children, how his heart smote him, as
                  memory's panorama unrolled itself before him, picturing in glaring colors, the
                  many times that he had vexed and abused that gentle woman, because he thought it
                     <emph>fun.</emph> Still, upon the fragrant air, arose the plaintive
                  supplications of the wounded, but now reviving spirit; and still, as if afraid to
                  break the hallowed influence of her petition, the conscience-stricken husband
                  stood, and winced, and listened.</p>
               <p>"O, Thou Searcher of hearts, and Trier of the reins of the children of men; I pray
                  Thee, have mercy upon my husband! Thou hast led Thine erring child by a way she
                  knew not, and hast brought her this night to feel the fullness of Thy salvation
                  through great tribulation. And Oh, Heavenly Father, for the sake of Thy Son, who
                  was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, grant to open the eyes of my dear
                  husband to a sense of his situation as a sinner. O, Jesus, by the memory of Thy
                  Temptation, subdue and save him!"</p>
               <p>She arose, with Hope and Trust beaming from every feature.</p>
               <p>"Meggie," said a husky voice, which was too deeply moved to articulate distinctly.
                  Husband and wife clasped each other in a thrilling embrace and wept together in
                  silence. The wife's tears were those of happiness; joy made all the brighter
                  because she had passed through weary seasons of darkness. The husband's sobs were
                  penitential in their deep bitterness.</p>
               <p>"Foregive," was the only word he could utter. And in the limpid moonlight, while
                  the shining hosts of stars rejoiced at the wanderer's return, that husband, who
                  had made Religion a by-word, knelt in humility beside his long tried wife, and
                  vowed eternal fealty to the King of Kings. Happiness, such as Mrs. Welden never
                  knew before, illumined her weary way.</p>
               <p>In after years, when the iron heel of poverty had ground her ambition to dust, and
                  she was left to wander unprotected through life, with <q>
                     <l>"Helpless, cowering little forms"</l>
                  </q> clinging trustingly to her for support, how her heart would bound at the
                  remembrance of that happy, moonlight time.</p>
               <p>They lingered long in the delightful, heaven canopied<pb n="70-71"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000036"/> bower, and when they returned to camp, the company
                  was wrapped in slumber.</p>
               <p>Early the next morning, Captain Gray's trumpet aroused the different cities and
                  villages which dotted the diversified hill-sides, plains and dells. A Scottish
                  bagpipe answered the loud summons of the trumpet, and a shrill bugle horn wound
                  forth its musical peals, taking up the sound of trumpet and bagpipe, and sending
                  the reverberation from hill-side to valley, and from valley to grove.</p>
               <p>It was an exhilarating scene. Rising smokes from the renewed camp fires danced and
                  curled, arose and united in the pleasant morning breeze. Busied throngs of men and
                  boys were herding, yoking, and harnessing their obedient dumb servants. Groups of
                  women and children ere hurrying to and fro, preparing the morning repast.</p>
               <p>The shrewd, calculating Yankee, bartered and bargained with the more practical
                  Southerner. Merchant talked with fellow merchant about the probable chances for
                  trade in the Western El Dorado, whither they were bound. English and American,
                  Irish and German, French and Italian, high and low, rich and poor, were bound for
                  the same alluring goal; each with the goddess Ambition whispering "success" in is
                  delighted ears.</p>
               <p>The Christian chanted the morning hymn of praise, and besought the Omnipotent to
                  grant him further blessings. And O, how great the contrast! Brutal oaths,
                  maledictions upon the defenceless oxen, were heard at intervals throughout the
                  camping grounds.</p>
               <p>A merry "huzzah!" from the first teamster who was ready to move ahead, as he
                  cracked his long whip lash in the morning air, was a signal for a general stir of
                  vehicles. And soon the moving mass of animate creation was jogging on, over the
                  rolling plain.</p>
               <p>Nothing of interest transpired during that first day's travel upon the undulating
                  prairie, which was spread out before and around the adventurers like an extensive
                  sea. At nightfall the multitude halted in a beautiful level valley. Indians, the
                  first that many of the travellers had seen, came to the camp and appeared very
                  friendly.</p>
               <p>Herbert got a joke on his sister, that he declared was "worth all the trouble they
                  had been to yet."</p>
               <p>An Indian, superbly decorated with buckskin fringes, beads, and fancy mocassins,
                  tried to purchase the curly-headed beauty. She humored his fancy for a while, not
                  thinking him in earnest, until he offered her mother the pony he was riding, to
                  keep until he could get five more from his band, the number he was willing to give
                  for her. She became alarmed, and retreated to the wagon. The Indian, intent upon
                  his purchase, followed her. She climbed into the wagon, closed the front curtain,
                  and would not see him again. He loosed the mocassins from his feet, turned to Mrs.
                  Good win with a disappointed air, gave them to her, and said, "for Curly Head,"
                  mounted his pony and disappeared.</p>
               <p>Herbert teased his sister unmercifully about her "sentimental savage." He would
                  laugh about the mocassins, which were certainly pretty, and nearly small enough
                  for her handsome feet. She bore the jesting very well for a while, but soon got
                  tired of his constant return to the subject of "Effie's first offer." She began to
                  cry, when one of his pointed jokes wrung a merry laugh from half a dozen
                  listeners, and Mrs. Goodwin forbid his mentioning the Indian again.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gray remarked to Mrs. Goodwin that she thought they had been too hasty in
                  forming an opinion against Mrs. Welden. "She's been so haughty like, that we ain't
                  seed the good that's in her, like we have in that other lady. I noticed to-day in
                  some talk I had with her, that she's better than most of them that's against her.
                  Polly seed her last<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6333-00000037"/> night when she
                  thought she was alone and hearn her to pray. She says she's troubled an' she knows
                  it."</p>
               <p>"I have felt an attachment for Mrs. Welden, from the first moment of our
                  acquaintance. The fact is, her disposition cannot tolerate rough jokes at her
                  expense. Her husband, though a man of many good qualities, is satirical to a
                  fault. He has discovered his wife's weak point and played upon it until he has
                  well nigh lost her affection."</p>
               <p>"Well; I thought mighty little of her at first, but I'll be her friend after
                  this."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Welden's children went to sleep early, and she walked away alone, as she had
                  done the evening before. Mrs. Goodwin followed her, but kept out of her sight. She
                  took a Bible from her pocket and read aloud, by the fast waning twilight, the
                  inspired words of the Psalmist:—</p>
               <p>"The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth His
                  handi-work.</p>
               <p>"Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge."</p>
               <p>She cast a prolonged look upwards to the beauteous skies. Stars, twinkling in the
                  gray twilight, were beginning to peep forth here and there in the crystal blue of
                  the upper deep.</p>
               <p>"Strange," she exclaimed, "that the beauty of these words was never before so
                  plain to my senses. 'I will praise the Lord while I have my strength; I will sing
                  praises unto our God while I have my being."</p>
               <p>Then turning to the prayer of the prophet Habbakuk, she read in a voice that Mrs.
                  Goodwin mentally compared to inspiration:—</p>
               <p>"'O, Lord revive Thy work; in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years
                  make known: In wrath remember mercy. God came from Teman and the Holy Once from
                  Mount Paran; Selah.</p>
               <p>"His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of His praise. Before Him
                  went the pestilence and burning coals went forth at His feet. <emph>He stood, and
                     measured the earth; He beheld, and drove asunder the nations. And the
                     everlasting mountains were scattered, and the perpetual hills did bow.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"Truly," thought her enraptured listener, "truly has it been said that 'out of the
                  mouths of babes and sucklings Thou hast perfected praise.' This babe in Christ;
                  this woman, who on week ago was caviling sneeringly at the word of God, has now
                  turned her mockery to praise, and is getting ahead of the oldest in the service,
                  by her enthusiasm in solitude.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Welden continued:—</p>
               <p>"Was God displeased against the rivers? Was Thine anger against the rivers? Was
                  Thy wrath against the sea, that Thou didst ride upon Thine horses and Thy chariots
                  of Salvation?</p>
               <p>"Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the tribes, even Thy
                  word. Selah.</p>
               <p>"Thou didst clear the earth with rivers: the mountains saw Thee and they trembled;
                  the overflowing of the waters passed by; the deep uttered his voice and lift up
                  his hands on high. <emph>The sun and moon stood still in their habitations. At the
                     light of Thine arrows they went, and at the shining of Thy glittering
                     spear.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"Thou didst march through the land in indignation, Thou didst thresh the heathen
                  in anger.</p>
               <p>Thou wentest forth for the salvation of Thy people, even for salvation with Thine
                  Anointed."</p>
               <p>The reader's voice faltered. She strained her eyes in the gathering darkness to
                  read on. Again the full, deep accepts of her soul broke forth audibly.:</p>
               <p>"They came out as a whirlwind to scatter me."</p>
               <p>Again, a pause:—</p>
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6333-00000038"/>
               <p>"My lips quivered at the voice," she continued. "Rottenness entered into my bones
                  and I trembled in myself that might find rest in the day of trouble."</p>
               <p>She raised her aching eyes to the studded heavens, and began in a sweet, melodious
                  strain, to sing:— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"My gracious Redeemer I love;</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">His praises aloud I'll proclaim,</l>
                        <l>And join with the armies above</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">To shout His adorable name.</l>
                        <l>He freely redeemed with his blood,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">My soul from the confines of hell,</l>
                        <l>To live on the smiles of my God,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">And in His sweet presence to dwell."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The moonlight glimmered upon the pages of Inspiration.</p>
               <p>Again she read. "Although the fig tree shall not bloom, neither shall fruit be in
                  the vines; the labor of the olive shall fail and the fields shall yield no meat;
                  the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the
                  stalls:—yet I will rejoice in the Lord; I will joy in the God of my
                  salvation."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Goodwin could keep still no longer. She rushed forward to meet the joyous
                  convert, and threw herself into her arms.</p>
               <p>"O, my dear Mrs. Welden; let me be your friend; let me participate in your joys.
                  Here I have been a professing Christian for twenty years; and you have this
                  evening put to shame my feeble services, by your enthusiasm in solitude, and your
                  earnest, explicit reading of portions of a prayer that I never comprehended the
                  deep beauty of before. O, why is it that I have so little fervor in the service of
                  my God?"</p>
               <p>"Those who have never passd through seasons of utter unbelief, do not need so
                  striking a proof of the existence and mercy of the Redeemer, as they, who, like
                  myself, have tried to ignore the existence of true Christianity. It was no
                  ordinary teaching, but a miracle that made St. Paul believe."</p>
               <p>"How long have you had such feelings as yon are now enjoying?"</p>
               <p>"Since yesterday evening. You no doubt have noticed with the rest, since John
                  vexed me so at Lagrange, that I had been sullen and ill natured. He wronged me by
                  his unfeeling levity, when every tender emotion of my soul had been stirred by a
                  meeting with my poor dear old Hannah. I thought to spite him by acting cross and
                  having nothing pleasant to say to any one but my children. I kept it up one day,
                  and the next no one seemed inclined to notice <emph>me.</emph> I felt that I was
                  alone in the world, with none to love me but my little ones; and, I shuddered at
                  the thought that they, too, would hate me when they should get old enough. John
                  did not try to reconcile me, and I grew, O, so miserable! Yesterday, Ada came to
                  where I was walking, and asked me if I would not let her love me. I would only
                  answer in monysyllables, but her kindness unnerved me, and I began to weep. I
                  tried to keep back the burning tears, but the anguish of my spirit had been so
                  long pent up, that I could no longer keep my feelings smothered, and I sobbed
                  aloud. Ada put her arm around me, and pointed to a passage in a testament she held
                  in her left hand, and bade me read:—</p>
               <p>"'Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest,'
                  "were the soothing words that met my eyes. I clasped the book with the energy of
                  despair;—ready and eager to be comforted, no matter how. She gently disengaged her
                  arm from my waist, yielded the book to my hand, and left me alone. I read on. My
                  mother's Bible was in my trunk. 'Can it be,' I thought, 'that I have neglected
                  that Book so long, when it contains such consolation as <emph>this?'</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"I was ashamed for John to see my emotion, so I put the book in my pocket before
                  getting into the carriage. I tried to shade my face with my hat and fan, but he
                  saw that I had<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6333-00000039"/> been weeping, and I
                  fancied that he looked troubled. When I left Lucy in your care, I went away where
                  I could wrestle, unseen, with Israel's God and mine. Peace, serene as Heaven, took
                  possession of my soul. While I was praying for John's conversion, he came to me,
                  and before we left the hallowed spot, we, who had both laughed to scorn the
                  religion of my mother, were rejoicing together, in the Hope that is stronger than
                  death. If my mother had lived, I believe the better part of my nature would have
                  been developed to some extent in childhood.</p>
               <p>"She was taken from me when I was but six years of age, and my father would never
                  allow me to be crossed or contradicted after her death. When my father died, and
                  my property was gone, I began to have trouble in earnest. I became acquainted with
                  Mr. Welden, and the friendship we began to cultivate, soon ripened into
                  affection.</p>
               <p>"If my temper had been good, we might have got along well together; but I was so
                  irritable, and he so provoking that we had many quarrels. I was most to blame for
                  minding what he would say, but I did not see my fault. My friends blamed me. I saw
                  this, and grew worse, until my fountains of happiness were all cut off.</p>
               <p>"Flattery and notice had been the food, and I may add, the bane of my existence
                  during my girlhood, and I could not live contented without it. It is not my
                  husband's disposition to flatter any one, and I would often irritate him. If it
                  had not been for my children, I would have left him long ago. I never breathed
                  this to mortal before, but I want to tell you all. I loved him no longer as I
                  ought to have loved—and I felt that the dislike was mutual. O, if you knew the
                  misery of such a feeling between those who in name are united, then you would know
                  what I suffered, when my pride would allow me to consider my true situation. We
                  did not <emph>understand</emph> each other, and I would not be the first to
                  attempt a reconciliation.</p>
               <p>"But I thank Thee, O, Heavenly Parent, that the dark cloud has at length passed
                  away. May the good work Thou hast began in us, save us from future
                  disagreements."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Welden appeared to have forgotten that she had an earthly listener.</p>
               <p>Mr. Welden was advancing towards them, and thinking it best to leave them alone,
                  Mrs. Goodwin went to the camp. <q>

               <p>READER, let us take an occasional peep at Ada Mansfield's journal.</p>
               <p>May 14th. "The Plains certainly wear a charm which I had not expected to see. The
                  view from the road to day was not so grand as when we commenced our journeyings;
                  but by going on horseback, some distance form the road, we could see a sight fit
                  for the Angles to admire. The little hollows, that by looking directly across the
                  plain cannot be discerned, were continually showing themselves at little distances
                  for our feet. They are filled with flowers of the choicest varieties and most
                  brilliant hues.</p>
               <p>May 15th. We crossed the Big Nemeha, a lovely looking, but dangerous stream, and
                  camped for the night upon its banks. Our Irishman, O'Donaldson, thought that the
                  luck, good and ban had all fallen to him. In ascending the bank of the stream,
                  which is very steep and sidelong, he became alarmed and called out "Gee! ye
                  spalpeens," when he meant to have said "Haw." The cattle are very much afraid<pb
                     n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6333-00000040"/> of him, and turned to the right, almost
                  upsetting the wagon. He jumped the tongue with commendable agility, and tried to
                  turn them to the left, still crying "Gee!" at the top of his voice. His words and
                  actions so crossed each other that the poor brutes, in trying to be obedient,
                  became tangled together so that two yokes of them became disengaged from the
                  others in the confusion.</p>
               <p>Pat buzzed around, halloaed and cursed until the wagon was up the hill. The other
                  vehicles had all been turned out from the road in camping order; and when his
                  wagon was upon level ground, Pat exclaimed complacently, "Arrah, Pat; an' ye're a
                  clever fellow now sure. It's certain I am an' no other chap in the company would
                  have got safe out o' this at all at all."</p>
               <p>"But where's your other cattle, Pat!" Pa asked.</p>
               <p>"Well, if I ain't beat! It warn't me as had missed 'em, now sure.'</p>
               <p>"Don't you see that two yokes of the oxen are missing?'</p>
               <p>"Oxen be durn'd an' I do see it now, but by me faith, I'm at the first of it.'</p>
               <p>"The detached cattle had stood for a moment upon the slippery hill side, when
                  finding that no one noticed them, they turned away, and when discovered were
                  quietly feeding among the timber that skirts the creek.</p>
               <p>"'Ah! me, hearties, and ye know how to get yourselves out of a scrape, now dont't
                  ye?'" said the amused Hiberian, e'er he patted the oxen caressingly.</p>
               <p>May 16th. "It is well that we crossed the Nemeha last evening, for there was such
                  a deluge of rain in the night that the stream has raised until those who are
                  behind will have to remain there several days. The north wind blows very
                  disagreeably, and is cold enough for November blasts.</p>
               <p>We to day crossed the Little Nemeha. This stream is only about thirty feet in
                  width and about two feet deep. It meanders among clusters of cottonwood, that grow
                  upon the rolling bluffs, which are arrayed like ramparts on each side of this
                  diminutive river.</p>
               <p>We passed five newly made graves to-day. Alas! How easily is human ambition cut
                  off! Rich and poor, high and low, are alike subject to attacks of sickness and not
                  one of us knows that we will live to again behold inhabited regions."</p>

               <p>Death, the king of terrors, had begun to make rapid invasions among the ranks of
                  the ill-fated emigrants. The unusual excitement and exercise of travelling and
                  camping out, had given most of the adventurous company insatiable appetites. Most
                  of the travellers had been used to fruits from infancy. But acting in accordance
                  with the advice of those who had crossed the Plains, and published rules of future
                  emigration to follow, all had ventured upon this perilous route, with at best a
                  scanty supply of dried fruits and no vegetables, while the never failing "bacon,"
                  filled everybody's provision wagons to overflowing.</p>
               <p>To those who may read these pages, we would say, do not consider the journey
                  hazardous, so far as sickness and death are concerned, provided the right course
                  is pursued. If you intend to undertake such a journey, leave hog's lard and bacon
                  where it cannot trouble you, and provide fruit in its stead. Fruit can be
                  hermetically scaled, and will keep an indefinite length of time in any climate.
                  Vegetables can be prepared in the same manner. Butter will keep fresh and good by
                  placing a solid roll of several pounds, around which a thoroughly salted cloth has
                  been wrapped, in the middle of each fifty pound flour sack. Dried beef, venison,
                  and well smoked hams, for those who <emph>must</emph> have salt meats, will keep
                  in the hottest parts of the journey, and will be much more healthy than the
                  obnoxious "side meat." Fresh meats can also be preserved by hermetical sealing.
                  But we do not intend to give a lengthy dissertation upon eatables and will dismiss
                  the subject.</p>
               <p>"I think some of us ought to go and see to that poor sick woman. A boy told me
                  that his mother had the cholera. He said his father died with it and everybody was
                  afraid to go about his mother's wagon, for fear of taking the disease" said Effie,
                  one noon-time to her mother, as she pointed to a solitary wagon around which two
                  little children of two and four years were playing, and a boy of ten was standing
                  upon the wagon tongue, gazing sorrowfully into the vehicle.</p>
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6333-00000041"/>
               <p>A discussion arose among Captain Gray's Company about what must be done. The timid
                  were anxious to keep aloof from contagion.</p>
               <p>"I will go," said Ada. "We none of us know how soon we may need aid. I would feel
                  afraid to face my Judge if called away, if I had proved myself too cowardly to
                  face disease and death for the sake of suffering humanity."</p>
               <p>"No, Ada," said Maurice, gazing tenderly into her beaming eyes, all aglow with
                  deep pity and concern for the distressed; "you must not face the danger. I will
                  go. Perhaps my knowledge of medicine will be of some use to the poor woman."</p>
               <p>"I'll go if you do," she answered decidedly. "Let those stay behind who have
                  families to care for. I am young and healthy and am not afraid to go. Beside, no
                  husband or child would have to weep if I were gone."</p>
               <p>"Let her go if she wants to," said her mother. "I would rather see her evince such
                  a spirit, than to know that she was afraid of a duty. I will go too."</p>
               <p>Ada assured her that she could tell if they were both needed, and begged her to
                  wait until she could see how the woman appeared.</p>
               <p>"Water," gasped the sufferer as she tossed herself about in agony. "O, to think of
                  dying here, with no one to care for the children when I am gone!"</p>
               <p>Tears came to Ada's eyes. Maurice never before looked so lovely to her as when
                  bending over that dying woman, whose companions had left her to her fate because
                  the disease was reported contagious. The woman looked at him with a vacant
                  stare.</p>
               <p>"Have you came to bury me? Tell me," she muttered in a guttural tone.</p>
               <p>"No, my dear madam, we've come to save you," said Maurice, clasping the sufferer's
                  hand. He felt the clammy sweat of death upon her attenuated fingers, and knew that
                  life was waning.</p>
               <p>"Water!" she gasped again.</p>
               <p>"Run my boy, and get your ma some water."</p>
               <p>"They wouldn't let pa <emph>have</emph> any, sir, and I was afraid to rolled down
                  his cheeks and his lips quivered, betraying the deep anguish of his young
                  heart.</p>
               <p>"Well, never mind, run quick to that camp; they've got water there."</p>
               <p>Ada had started when Maurice first spoke to the boy, and soon returned with a cup
                  of the delicious beverage. The sufferer quaffed a long, deep draught, looked her
                  thanks, raised her glassy eyes to Heaven, murmured, "God save my little ones," and
                  expired.</p>
               <p>The ministering couple cast a mournful look upon the dead, upon the children, and
                  upon each other. Ada took up the youngest child, who called herself "Eda" and told
                  her to look at her ma. The child's face and clothing were begrimmed with dirt, but
                  the neat fit and faultless stitches of its brown Holland apron and delaine dress,
                  so well suited to the journey, showed that its mother had been a woman of
                  taste.</p>
               <p>"Ma, ma, Eda's <emph>so</emph> hungry," said the child.</p>
               <p>Ada led the other little girl, who gave her name as "Dilly," by the hand and
                  carried the little one to her mother. The other women all went back with her to
                  the wagon. The orphan boy was old enough to feel his loss, and was lying on the
                  grass, sobbing in utter despair. Maurice had closed the eyes and straightened the
                  form of the dead. He tried to console the boy and gain some information about the
                  name of his parents, and the cause of their having been left alone. The child said
                  his parents' name was Baker. His father was taken sick the morning before, and the
                  company they were<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6333-00000042"/> with would not lie by
                  for them. They had a teamster, who stayed with them till his father was dead, and
                  got some men who were passing to help bury him. When everybody was gone, his
                  mother was taken so sick that she could not go on. Andy, as the boy called him got
                  afraid of to cholera, and left them alone. His ma was sick all night. He had told
                  one man about it, but he cursed him, and he didn't tell any one else, until Effie
                  asked him what made him look so bad. This was the substance of the boy's story,
                  told in a broken manner. Their cattle, he said, were off about a mile in a
                  southern direction.</p>
               <p>The women began to prepare the remains for interment, and were engaged in hunting
                  clothing from the trunks of the deceased in which to dress the body for burial,
                  when Captain Gray and the other men, who had been off for an hour with the cattle,
                  returned. Sam Green and his brothers, went immediately after the cattle that
                  belonged to the orphans. A grave was made by Captain Gray and Daddy Green, while
                  Mansfield and Welden constructed a box from the sides of the wagon bed to answer
                  for a coffin.</p>
               <p>The humane company collected around the grave which was ready to receive the dead,
                  and a few sturdy voices joined in singing: <q>

                  all traces of that husband and wife's existences, were visible in the torn up
                  wagon, and helpless, sorrowing little ones. Necessary clothing for the children
                  was taken from the baggage, and the wagon was then burned, in order to prevent, if
                  possible, the spreading of the disease, should it prove contagious. Mr. and Mrs.
                  Mansfield took the children under their protection, and supplied all their

               <head type="sub">MR. BAKER'S TRAVELLING COMPANY AND ANDY.</head>
               <p>IT IS a singular fact that emigrants upon the Plains, are not affected long at a
                  time by <emph>anything.</emph> The excitement of travelling, the constant
                  intercourse with strangers, the varied scenery and constant unfolding of something
                  new, makes<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6333-00000043"/> adventurers reckless, and many
                  times fool-hardy; while the opposite extreme of sheet cowardice and depravity, is
                  sometimes exhibited in a deplorable manner.</p>
               <p>Jokes and repartee was the camping pastime with most of the emigrants, and with
                  many of the "Gray crowd," were passed as freely as ever. The presence of the
                  orphans, however, was a restraint upon some of them. Effie had questioned Johnny
                  Baker about the name of his company. He told her that it was called Bald Hill
                  Train, because their captain used to live on a Bald Hill in Wisconsin; and to
                  distinguish him from his relatives of the name in his vicinity, they had dubbed
                  him Bald Hill Smith.</p>
               <p>Effie told Captain Gray, who vowed that if he could overtake him, "he'd give him a
                  piece of his mind, if he got swung for it."</p>
               <p>The next morning they started early as usual, and had proceeded about a mile, when
                  they overtook a train that had not yet started. Ada, who was walking, as was her
                  habit, in the morning air, stopped at the nearest wagon and asked the cause of the
                  delay.</p>
               <p>"Sickness and death," said a serious looking woman who was nursing a sick child in
                  the shade of the wagon.</p>
               <p>"Our captain says that those who are well must not lie by for the sick, or all
                  will die."</p>
               <p>Men were driving up the cattle and horses. The woman looked at her suffering babe
                  and burst into tears.</p>
               <p>"We'll have to go, Mary," said her husband, as he drove up his team and stooped to
                  kis his wife, whose sealding tears were dropping upon the face of the feverish
                  infant.</p>
               <p>"If we were to stay here there is no telling what might happen. It is best to keep
                  with our company while we can."</p>
               <p>"But it does look so hard to think we can't <emph>try</emph> to save him. My
                  precious, precious babe!"</p>
               <p>It was the Bald Hill Train that had again been visited by death. A woman had died
                  during the night, and the delay had been occasioned by her burial.</p>
               <p>Captain Gray drove up his team to where a man was standing, whom he judged was the
                  commander of the train. His be-whickered and sun-burnt countenance, expressive of
                  impatience and ill-humor, an the muttered imprecations and overbearing air of the
                  stalwart, half savage looking man, were so like what he had imagined of "Bald Hill
                  Smith," that he felt certain that he was the veritable Captain for whom he was
                  looking. Captain Gray surveyed him leisurely from head to foot. The fellow
                  returned the gaze, and moving towards him with a swaggering air, he said,
                  comically, "Don't you think I'm a darnation pretty man? Or is it my clothes that
                  takes your eye? I haven't seen a fellow so stuck after my finery, for many a day;"
                  and he glanced at his garments, which were anything but decent in appearance.</p>
               <p>"Are you the Captain of this company?"</p>
               <p>"Some of 'em call me Cap. sometimes, but I don't profess to be regular
                  commander."</p>
               <p>"Well, if ye're Bald Hill Smith, I've got somethin' to tell ye. If ye die on these
                  Plains while may head's above dirt, me nor my men won't bury ye! Any poor, dirty,
                  good-for-nothin' wretch, that'll leave a sick woman to die, ought to swing! Depend
                  upon it, <emph>you</emph> won't git turned under by any of my men!"</p>
               <p>"I don't expect to want the favor. Nothing is further from my calculations than
                  wanting to be buried. I started to <emph>Oregon, I</emph> did. Agreeing to wait
                  sick folk's motions was no part of my bargain."</p>
               <p>"Ye may need help yerself afore long, but if ye git yer deserts, ye'll fall a prey
                  to buzzards, provided they'll eat ye. Where's the villain Andy, that left poor
                  Baker's folks?"</p>
               <p>If its Andy Billens, you're hunting for, that worthy gentleman is at your
                  service," he replied.</p>
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6333-00000044"/>
               <p>A scowl of indignation overshadowed the Captain's face. Fire flashed from his
                  eyes, as with muscular strength and hearty good will, he dealt two powerful blows
                  with his heavy whip upon the fellows thinly covered shoulders. The coward did not
                  dare to resist, but retreated a few paces and asked him what he meant by such
                  actions.</p>
               <p>"I don't want ye to <emph>ask</emph> me what I mean! Ye know as well as I do, that
                  no man what's fit to live, would go off and leave a sick woman and helpless young
                  'uns to the mercy of Injuns. ye may well shake and turn pale, ye dirty
                  vagabon'!"</p>
               <p>"I guess my life is as dear to me as hers was, if not as little more so. I've no
                  notion of lying by for the sake of <emph>anybody.</emph>" The cowardly wretch
                  walked away.</p>
               <p>"A stout looking individual in a butternut suit and home-made, oat-straw hat, rode
                  up.</p>
               <p>"Forward, march! Them as don't stir their stumps 'll be left behind in this race,"
                  vociferated Captain Smith, in full consciousness of his dignity as
                     <emph>Commander.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"What's to be done with that 'are sick young 'un?" demanded Captain Gray.</p>
               <p>"Young'un be d—d!" said this "protector" of a collection of human beings, who had
                  agreed to place themselves under his command for months.</p>
               <p>"I say there's got to be somethin' done for that child; an if ye don't wait a
                  while, ye'll feel the cut of my whip a leetle stronger than yer companion, Andy
                  had to feel it. If the rest o' ye had my pluck, we'd tar and feather this
                  rascal."</p>
               <p>The Captain cast a look of contempt at his son-in-law, who evidently had no taste
                  for the business that Captain Gray had been trained in youth to believe was
                  manly.</p>
               <p>"What right have you to stop my train?"</p>
               <p>"Sure, an' its the rights of humanity we have; an' we'll show ye how to use 'em,
                  if ye don't look shar-rp. I remember ber all about a shillalah; an' ye'll git the
                  best lickin' that's been heard of in many a day, if yer persist in wakin' up the
                  Irish that's in me," said O'Donaldson, with an ominous shake of his long
                  whip-stock.</p>
               <p>"Pat; ye're worth a score of milk-and-water folks," said Captain Gray.</p>
               <p>Maurice was testing his skill as a physician upon the sick babe. The pulse
                  throbbed violently. The tongue was parched and dry, and the eyes were rolled back
                  so as to almost hide the bright blue orbs that had been his mother's delight.</p>
               <p>"Give the child some water. He suffers from thirst."</p>
               <p>"<emph>What?</emph>" exclaimed the astounded mother. "<emph>Water</emph> to a
                  child so sick as this?"</p>
               <p>"I can undertake the cure of no disease, unless the patient is permitted to have
                  water in small quantities. Madam, your child is burning, consuming with fever. You
                  have the power to give him a cooling draught, for the want of which he is dying.
                  Will you refuse?"</p>
               <p>"God save my darling!" she exclaimed, as she held a cup of water to its fevered
                  mouth. The child was almost convulsive in its eagerness to drink.</p>
               <p>"There!" said Maurice, when the babe had gulped nearly a half pint of the cooling
                  drink. The child needs no medicine. He is teething, and if you will break the
                  fever he will recover in a few days. I will lance his gums to relieve the pain and
                  give the teeth a chance to appear."</p>
               <p>"Have you got any calomel, Doctor? We have none, and can't do my baby any good
                  without it."</p>
               <p>"I guess we can subdue the fever without the aid of poison. You must bathe him in
                  cold water."</p>
               <p>"O, mercy! The train's goin to start, and I can't bathe him while we're
                  travelling!"</p>
               <p>"A wet sheet will answer the purpose."</p>
               <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6333-00000045"/>
               <p>Ada spoke: "I will get a tin pail from pa's carriage, that has a closely fitting
                  lid. With your permission, I will ride in your wagon to-day. The companies will
                  probably keep pretty close together."</p>
               <p>"It's just what I would have asked; but contagion has so rung in my ears ever
                  since poor Baker was taken ill, that I hated to request you to stay with me."</p>
               <p>Ada tripped away after the tin pail, filled it from a gurgling rivulet by the
                  roadside, and seated herself among the kettles in the front of Mr. Thomson's
                  wagon, as though she had never thought of riding in a covered chariot, here
                  everything was <foreign xml:lang="FRA">comme il faut</foreign>.</p>
               <p>The child was soon encased in the dripping sheet. His little body quivered when
                  the cold linen enshrouded him; and the frightened mother exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"It will <emph>kill</emph> him! I thought it would from the first."</p>
               <p>"Never fear, Mrs. Thomson. The shivering is a good symptom. The water is doing its
                  work. Wrap him up snugly."</p>
               <p>The tiny form was bundled in heavy blankets. In fifteen minutes they removed the
                  sheet, which was steaming like a seething kettle. Ada tried the efficiency of
                  friction upon his moistened body. As she had never before scarcely touched a sick
                  infant, she was surprised at her own aptness in the art of nursing. The child,
                  after being well rubbed, was placed in a dry sheet, and was soon sleeping as
                  quietly as though nothing had been the matter.</p>
               <p>The parents were fervent in the praises they lavished upon their benefactors; and
                  when Maurice refused to accept a recompense for his professional advice, they were
                  perfectly astonished. They had been brought up n a land of doctor who gave
                  nauseons medicines, and "run up" unreasonable bill, ad they looked upon the
                  profession as calling, the basis of which is <emph>money.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>The child was considered out of danger at sunset. The two companies camped near
                  each other, and it must be said to the credit of Capt. Smith, that during the
                  remainder of the journey, he evinced considerable humanity in more than one
                  instance. The example of Capt. Gray had taught him a lesson, which he saw plainly
                  that it would not do to forget. He had incurred the displeasure of his company,
                  and a spirit of rebellion showed itself so plainly, that he was frightened into
                  humanity of action.</p>

               <p>May 28th PLATTE RIVER rolls before me. We struck the river this evening for the
                  first time. Opposite our camp is Grand Island, covered with timber and grass. The
                  cattle were driven on to this Island, and the men waded to it and procured wood
                  for cooking purposes.</p>
               <p>"The water of the river is thick with sand, but we are compelled to use it,
                  because we can get no better.</p>
               <p>May 29th. "Traveled eight miles, to Fort Kearney, where we halted a while to write
                  letters, look at curiosities, and divert ourselves in various other ways.</p>
               <p>"The Fort contains two respectable dwellings, which to us, who had been journeying
                  for three weeks without seeing anything like settled civilization, presented an
                  appearance of a pleasing nature.</p>
               <p>"After leaving the Fort we moved on for about eight miles, with the expectation of
                  having to travel more than a hundred before finding a place to ford the river.</p>
               <p>"But we saw teams crossing at this place, and concluded to try it with the rest,
                  as health as well as facilities for wood and grass, are reported to be much batter
                  on the north than on the south side.</p>
               <p>We are camped upon the banks of the Platte, without ordinary fuel, but we find
                  plenty of Buffalo chips.</p>
               <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6333-00000046"/>
               <p>May 30th. Sabbath day. Intended to have lain by to-day, but after taking all
                  matters into consideration, we thought it best to cross the river this morning.
                  Last Sabbath we did not travel. Instead of each one indulging in private
                  meditation, or engaging in public worship, there was more thoughtlessness
                  exhibited than on an other day. The cattle, it is true, were permitted, to rest,
                  but many of them got an overdose of alkali grass and were sick in consequence of
                  their prolonged feast. Billy Green got into a fight with a boy from a neighboring
                  camp, whose father was too religious to travel on Sunday; but who allowed his
                  hopeful son to fight, as a mark of commendable chivalry. Our Captain, who
                  possesses a kind of intuitive horse knowledge that makes us all respect him, said
                  that if be were a Christian, "he wouldn't <emph>mock</emph> his Maker, by tryin'
                  to lay by Sundays. Be hanged if it ain't an insult to your king, to offer him
                  homage that does ye no credit."</p>
               <p>The crossing of the river, proved more tedious than difficult.—The ford is about a
                  mile and a half in width, and at this season of the year, three feet in depth,
                  except in occasional hollows in the quicksand bottom, where the cattle would
                  almost swim. The vehicles made a muffled noise in rolling over the sand, not
                  unlike the noise a wagon makes in going through a snow-drift.</p>
               <p>May 31st. We are journeying up the Platte. The valley is generally level in
                  appearance, but we sometimes come unexpectedly upon sloughs or creeks, which we
                  can see but little trace of until we reach the banks.</p>
               <p>These hollow, unlike the others we have seen, are not bordered with timber. They
                  are fringed to the water's edge with grass and flowers, and more probably dry out
                  in the latter part of of Summer.</p>
               <p>Camped upon the margin of one of these gulches, where we get better water than
                  that of the P atte. We are about a mile from the river. On the north, about three
                  miles form us, thought it does not appear top be half so far, the bluffs are
                  ranged along in quite a romantic manner. They appear to be barren in the extreme;
                  though their unsurpassed beauty atones for their apparent lack of worth.</p>
               <p>We have no wood except the chips before mentioned, which in the absence of
                  ordinary fuel, we do not mind to use, as they make an excellent fire.</p>
               <p>June 1st. The weather is exceedingly hot, making going ahead a ledious and
                  laborious occupation.</p>
               <p>Eiffie Goodwin was attacked this morning by the Emigrant Cholera, and her mother
                  and brothers are much distressed, Maurice has undertaken her case and we hope for
                  the beet.</p>
               <p>We met a company to day who had started back to the States, on account of sickness
                  and death. They buried one of their number yesterday and another this morning, and
                  had come back about four miles when we met them. They abandoned one wagon because
                  they could get no one to drive the team. They were from Springfield, Illinois.</p>
               <p>We suffered much during the afternoon, on account of the great scarcity of good
                  water. That of the Platte being so muddy and warm that it is impossible for
                  civilized people to drink it.</p>
               <p>June 2d. Another <emph>insufferably</emph> hot day. After we camped this evening,
                  a west wind arose and blew a perfect gale for an hour. Its fury partially abated,
                  but we think a hard storm may be expected tonight, as black clouds darken the
                  western horizon, and dance and loom up majestically towards the blue zenith. We
                  have heard much about Platte River storms and are looking for one with mingled awe
                  and curiosity.</p>
               <p>June 3d. It came. The deep toned thunder boomed and howled, groaned and murmured,
                  rumbled and tremble over our heads. Then, a dead, dark silence reigned throughout
                  the valley for a moment. It was but a moment. The lightning's grand, alluring
                  glare, lit up the hills and valley, and burnished the agitated river, till it
                  sparkled like a rolling sea of diamonds. Blazes and streaks and streams and
                  flashes of heaven charged artillery beamed and burned, advanced and retreated in
                  the arching heavens. Anon a booming sound, the report and re-action of the
                  expended aerial magazines, burst loud and terrific over the now blackened valley.
                  Silence, the dread hush of expectation and suspense again ruled for a season. Then
                  came a roaring sound like the "rushing of many waters." and the furious winds
                  shook the tents, until each rope and pin and pulley of the stout marquees was
                  straining and groaning in the tempest. The wagons rocked as if in agony.—Cattle
                  stampeded, horses neighed, women and children shrieked at intervals, and all felt
                  the omnipotent only, had power to save omnipotent. Prayers from those who were
                  ashamed to own them when the danger was past, ascended from fear-stricken
                  souls.</p>
               <p>I asked myself in the midst of this glorious confusion, why it was that so many
                  felt afraid of the storm? When we are in the hands of God who rules the tempests,
                  why can we not trust Him?</p>
               <p>Heaven's batteries were reinforced and a second discharge of artillery, yet more
                  grand than the first, because longer continued, brightened up the gloom, and
                  another report, drowing the sound of roaring<pb n="92-93"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000047"/> winds, seemed to shake the valley from centre of
                  circumference. Rock howled to rock, and echoes re-echoed through the distant
                  hills. I tho't of the days when first this earth was formed, and wondered if, when
                  the Omniscient 'spake and it was done; commanded and it stood fast,' there were
                  such scenes such sounds, and such tremblings and throes of the earth as we were
                  then experiencing?</p>
               <p>The hail and rain, as if waiting for mortals to witness what lightning, thunder,
                  and wind would do, unaided by their efforts, kept back for half an hour. And then
                  the torrent descended with its might upon its luckless adventurers. Not a wagon
                  cover or tent could be kept from leaking. Effie, who is still feeble, has appeared
                  better since the storm abated, but she did not escape the general saturation.</p>
               <p>This morning the sky was clear as if nothing had happened; but the whole valley
                  was flooded. The long grass and weeds were lying on top of the water that
                  everywhere stood several inches in depth. The stock which had stampeded in the
                  night, were quietly feeding about a mile from camp. The river, darker and muddier
                  than ever, rolled on as though it had never lashed the shores in fury, or splashed
                  its murky waters over the tents of emigrants.</p>
               <p>A spice of fun seasons almost everything, and now that the danger is past, the
                  boys consider that they have an excellent supply of ludicrous items. The mats
                  forming their beds, had been placed on the ground in the tents and of course were
                  wet as water could make them. There was no chance to dry anything by fires, but
                  happily for all of us the sun arose as though fair weather was all we had ever
                  witnessed.</p>
               <p>"Sure an' old Sol knows what he's about," said Pat, as he arranged his bedding on
                  the outside of the wagon cover nearest the men.</p>
               <p>"He wants to helps us out o' a scrape, for nara bit does he like to see us
                  sufferin'. Such storms as this don't come when Sol's awake."</p>
               <p>"You did'nt feel so funny last night when you prayed so hard for the storm to
                  cease," said Herbert Goodwin.</p>
               <p>"'Arrah! an' it was the echo of yer own hear-rt if ye hear-rd any prayin'."</p>
               <p>"Why, Pat! will you deny it?"</p>
               <p>"Of coorse an' it ain't me as denies it at all, I think it's more'n likely that ye
                  heard prayin', that is, when the stor-rm did'nt drown yer voice."</p>
               <p>"Ill give it up. Pat," said Herbert, who saw that the boys were about to get a
                  laugh at his expense. He turned the tide of fun in his own favor by pretending to
                  acknowledge what Pat accused him of.</p>
               <p>I walked with Herbert awhile to day. I never before conversed with a boy of
                  fifteen who had such elevated ideas. If he lives, he'll make a sensation of
                  importance in the world.</p>
               <p>We camped this evening where we have to again use the river water; but we have
                  learned enough to drive some distance from the banks and choose an elevated spot
                  for the tents.</p>
               <p>Maurice and I strolled along the river bank. Light clouds were floating overhead
                  and in the west, and of deep black covered the eastern horizon.</p>
               <p>We were conversing in a low tone, and Herbert, who was out on a mediating
                  excursion, was so deeply absorbed in reverie that he did not notice our near
                  approach.</p>
               <p>A delicious shower completely enveloped us. Maurice threw an oil cloth cloak over
                  my head, but I shook it off and enjoyed the gentle rain as well as the birds and
                  flowers did.</p>
               <p>Sudddenly the sun shone out in splendor and the dark cloud in the east became
                  illuminated by a rainbow, unequalled in effulgence by any that I had ever seen
                  before. Herbert appeared wholly engrossed in this glorious scene. He stationed
                  himself in an attitude worthy of an orator, and repeated Campbell's song of the
                  Rainbow, that he had practiced upon at school until he could deliver it perfectly;
                  changing the words enough to make it suit the time and occasion, apparently with
                  out the least effort: <q>

               <p>THE MORNING Sun arose like a golden winged seraph upon Captain Gray's Company.
                  Beads of azure-tinted spray illumined every leaf and flower, and dwarfy shrub.
                  Gentle breezes swept at intervals over the turbid river, and kissed the cheeks of
                  the adventurers, who were hurriedly preparing the morning meal, or engaged in
                  driving and yoking the cattle. Birds of brilliant hues caroled forth their songs
                  of gladness, from wild rose bush and hawthorn shrub. Buffaloes that had become
                  wary in consequence of frequent attacks from emigrants, occasionally showed
                  themselves upon the opposite side of the river; while the bounding antelope leaped
                  gracefully over the hills, a few miles from the valley, and in sight of the
                  wistful campers.</p>
               <p>Breakfast was ready, but some of the teams were missing, The train could not go on
                  until all were found; and Daddy Green and his boys consented to bunt the cattle,
                  if some of the others would hunt an antelope. The men who were in good health
                  mounted the mules belonging to Mansfield and Welden, and started in pursuit of a
                  graceful animal that was bounding from crag to crag upon some rugged bluffs in
                  sight of the camp.</p>
               <p>A train overtook the waiting company, and a gentlemanly looking individual; asked
                  Mrs. Goodwin if a doctor belonged to their crowd. She told him of Maurice, who had
                  gone with the hunters.</p>
               <p>The gentlemen requested one of his men who was mounted to ride after and overtake
                  him. The train moved up along side the waiting wagons and halted. The sympathizing
                  females of Captain Gray's Company had learned to shun no<pb n="96-97"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000049"/> sickness, and a common impulse moved them all to
                  lend a helping hand.</p>
               <p>Three persons were dangerously sick; a gentleman and two ladies, who had all been
                  attacked by cholera during the previous night. The news of Dr. Stanton's success
                  in curing Mrs. Thomson's baby had been circulated among a long line of emigrants,
                  and hearing that his company was but a few miles ahead, Mr. Mays had started at
                  dawn to overtake him, if possible.</p>
               <p>Maurice soon returned and examined the sufferers. Two of them were past recovery.
                  A lady of middle age, whose livid countenance still bore traces of the beauty of
                  by-gone days, was supported by a fair young girl of eighteen, whose wine-colored
                  merino dress, and pure white morning collar and wrist-bands, appeared in bold
                  relief beside the soiled wagon cover, outside bed clothing, and dusty appearance
                  generally, of everything around her. She gazed sorrowfully upon the face of the
                  dying woman, and asked Maurice in a mournful voice. if there was hope. He replied
                  that the weakness preceding death had come on. 'If her constitution has been good,
                  she may possible rally for a short time, but her destiny is fixed."</p>
               <p>The young physician turned away, sorrowful in heart, but unflinching in duty to
                  the other sufferers, while the young lady bowed her head and let the scalding tear
                  drops fall upon the unconscious face of the sleeper.</p>
               <p>The next woman was in great pain of body and distress of mind; though all could
                  see, by the strength she evinced in groaning, tossing from side to side, and
                  uttering detached sentences, that there was some chance for life. She begged
                  piteously for water, Maurice commanded them to let her have it.</p>
               <p>"She's been taking calomel, sir, and we were afraid to give her water," said her
                  husband in a tremulous voice.</p>
               <p>"Let her have it; she'll die if she doesn't get it. Salivation will probably
                  follow as a consequence, but it's the least of two evils."</p>
               <p>The drink was given, and the poor woman who had been dosed with brandy, and was
                  suffering under application of mustard poultices and blisters that would have well
                  nigh destroyed a healthy person, revived instantly, so that she could speak
                  distinctly.</p>
               <p>"These bed-clothes—throw them off, for mercy's sake! I'm burning up," she
                  murmured.</p>
               <p>Maurice consulted the pulse, Inward fever raged violently, but the surface of the
                  skin was cold and clammy. Her misguided friends, in the hope of sending the
                  unnatural heat from her vitals, had given her repeated doses of fourth-proof
                  brandy, While they were endeavoring to <emph>draw forth the fever</emph> with
                  cantharides and mustard.</p>
               <p>"Did you treat the other lady in this manner?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; we didn't know what else to do."</p>
               <p>"No wonder she couldn't endure it. You or I would die under this treatment. For
                  heaven's sake, remove these obnoxious blisters, and get a sponge and luke-warm
                  water. She must be well bathed, and then friction will do more to restore her
                  exhausted body than all the fiery potations or blistering inventions you can
                  procure."</p>
               <p>There was warm water at Mrs. Gray's camp-fire, and while the anxious friends and
                  warm-hearted strangers were following the physician's directions, he proceeded to
                  examined the dying man. Bends of colds perspiration stood on his broad, manly
                  brow. He was a young husband, and the wife of his bosom stood calmly holding his
                  hand, and striving to cheer her husband with hopeful words. Her face was calm and
                  eyes tearless, but lines of sorrow were penciled around the mouth, betraying the
                  anguish she was striving in vain to hide from the watchful eye of her dying
                  consort. She<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6333-00000050"/> pressed the clay-cold hand
                  and said, "My dear, the doctor's come. We'll have you well directly; cheer up, and
                  hear what he has to say."</p>
               <p>But the doctor could speak of no earthly hope, and strove while the sufferers
                  senses remained, to point out to him the place of final refuge,</p>
               <p>"I know in whom I have believed. Kiss me, Julia; I'm going Home. I little though
                  that I would have to leave you in this wild place, but I must go. My precious
                  babe! O, teach its little lips to praise the Saviour of its father, whose face the
                  little one will never again behold in this world. You know how I want my child to
                  be educated. All is left to you. The eternal hills of Paradise are before me, and
                  I must haste away. Farewell to life."</p>
               <p>Another hour passed, and another spirit was singing hallelujahs in the land of the
                  blessed; another had triumphed over death, darkness, and the grave.</p>
               <p>The dying woman was again visited by the kind-hearted women, Mrs. Godwin remaining
                  behind to comfort the bereaved widow, who, with an infant a few weeks old, was
                  left to battle with the adverse winds and waves of adventure, in her lonely
                  journeying to a distant land.</p>
               <p>Tears were rolling down the cheeks of Martha Martin, the watchful nurse of the
                  dying woman, but she was unconscious of her mourner's sorrow.</p>
               <p>"Is this woman your aunt?" Ada asked, tenderly.</p>
               <p>"No; but she has been my friend—my only one almost, for ten long years," and she
                  bowed her head in a fresh shower of tears.</p>
               <p>The sufferer died, and gave no sign, no expression of Christian faith; but when
                  the form, beautiful in death, was arrayed for the tomb, a placid smile was stamped
                  upon the features, that chased from the minds of the beholders the terror of the
                  Fell Destroyer.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mays had known sorrow. The husband of her youth became a confirmed inebriate,
                  ran away in a fit of madness, and for years she had had no knowledge of his
                  whereabouts. The hope that he would one day return, a reformed and useful man,
                  sustained the spirit of his wife for a while, but the heart-sickening reality of
                  hope deferred, had finally crushed her spirit, and destroyed a constitution never
                  robust. A brother of her husband, an honest, upright man, was going to Oregon with
                  his family, and having no kindred ties to bind her to her Bay State home, she had
                  consented to accompany him. It is said that persons disposed to be melancholy are
                  most liable to attacks of disease. The cholera, from its fist appearance, had
                  taken deep hold upon her imagination, and her sister-in-law remarked, after her
                  death, that it had been impossible to keep her from seeing every new made grave,
                  and hearing of every new case of sickness for miles before and behind them.</p>
               <p>The next morning was appointed for the burial. Captain Gray's ideas of generosity
                  would not permit him to leave the sorrow-stricken company until the last sad rites
                  were performed; and sending off the stock in the care of the boys, he prepared to
                  remain in camp throughout the day. The dead were as neatly prepared for burial as
                  circumstances would permit, and placed in the most capacious tent tat could be
                  procured, and a large fire was built in front of the tent for the benefit of those
                  who were to observe the" wake."</p>
               <p>"I begin to have faith in christianity." said Mansfield. "My wife was a professor
                  and church member before I knew her, and I had no opportunity to test, from a
                  change in her deportment, the principles of the faith which works by love. My
                  daughter early embraced her mother's views. I considered this a free country, and
                  never opposed their notions, though I confess, I thought they indulge a belief
                  that would do them no good."</p>
               <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6333-00000051"/>
               <p>"The death of Mr. Graves is proof positive of an existence beyond the grave;
                  which, however, I have never doubted. But the trust and confidence he displayed,
                  when giving parting instructions to his wife, <emph>must</emph> have emanated from
                  a Divine source."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Captain Gray, "I always believed in religion, but I look on it as
                  somethin' too high for poor folks in the Sucker State. All the Christians I knowed
                  in Blue Creek Bottom, belonged to the starch and broad-cloth order; an' the
                  preachers, if they spoke to me at all, acted as though they committed a mighty act
                  of condescension. I've seen wonders on these Plains; that proud creetur', Miss
                  Welden, that we was all so shy of at first, is so changed that a body can hardly
                  think that she's the same woman. She has a smile for everybody, an' never speaks
                  cross to poor Welden, who, if he did deserve it, used to git wretchedly snapped up
                  by her sometimes. I believe he's changed as much as she is. He's funny as ever,
                  but he don't torment his woman, nor anybody else like he did. It's singular what
                  makes the difference. If it's the grace of God that's done it, it's a mighty
                  invention, that's a fact. The hymn ye sung at the grave of poor Miss Baker, took
                  powerful hold on my feelin's."</p>
               <p>Ada spoke. "I <emph>love</emph> the dear old fashioned psalm and hymn tunes. There
                  is something so peculiarly grand in their sublime, melodious strains, that I dwell
                  upon them with enthusiasm. My grandfather, whose hoary locks, bleached in the
                  frosts of ninety winters, sang a Doxology to the tune of Old Hnndred, the last day
                  of his earthly pilgrimage. There is one song of his, the name of the tune I have
                  forgotten, that I often sing to ma', when she is sad, and it has many times
                  revived my lagging faith, to sing it when alone: <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"I feast on honey milk and wine,</l>

                        <l>Mount Zion's glories round me shine,</l>

                     </lg>

                        <l>I dive in pleasures deep and full,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">In praises full of glory,</l>
                        <l>And feel my Savior in my soul,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">And groan to tell the story.'"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Ada chanted, rather than sung these lines, and all eyes were turned upon her with
                  interest.</p>
               <p>"O, what a picture!" she continued; "what material for a useful romance, a well
                  balanced mind could gather from the scenes of a pilgrimage over the plains! How
                     <emph>truth</emph> in its positive beauty and emphatic worth could be shown up
                  to many who disbelieve in the exalted faith of the gospel. How many heart-lessons
                  might be treasured up and related for the benefit of those who never knew the
                  realities of a journey like this. Kindred's ties, friendship's associations, and
                  often love's holy bonds, are severed in the momentous parting hour. Then come
                  travels, scenery, mirth, sorrow, sickness and death in successive and strange
                  confusion. Refinement and depravity mingle together; quarrels, murder and enmity
                  rage, and O, how great the difference; the Christian's hymn of praise, and the
                  dying believer's triumph are daily represented. What a lesson for those who
                  witness these scenes!"</p>
               <p>"But," said Mrs. Mays, "you surely would not write a novel! Fictitious reading is
                  an abomination to the Lord. Why not relate the simple facts as they occur, taking
                  care to keep truth upon your side, if you write at all, and keep your conscience
                  clear of the sin of novel-writing? Lord help the rising generation." she added
                  complacently, drawing a deep sigh.</p>
               <p>Ada smiled, and was about to reply, when Herbert interposed.</p>
               <p>"Have you read Galliher's Pilgrimage of Adam and David?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed I have not," she answered piously. My sister-in-law read it; but I am
                  thankful that my conscience is clear<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6333-00000052"/>
                  upon that point. My niece also read the book; but she thinks her aunt has no right
                  to advise her. Time was when Martha Martin was glad to get assistance from me,"
                  and she cast a meaning glance at her niece, whose father had been her only
                  brother, but who, like the husband of the deceased widow, had fallen a prey to
                  drunkenness, and abandoned a wife and daughter to their fate. The wife did not
                  long survive the separation, and Martha was left at a tender age, in the care of
                  the aunt.</p>
               <p>"I dare say, I know more about the history of David than you do," said Herbert. "I
                  read Galliher's book until I got it at my tongue's end. I know that if I had read
                  that same history a score of times, in the Bible, I would not have known it half
                  so well."</p>
               <p>"Just so with any descriptive novel," said Ada. "Our excitable natures grow weary
                  of a simple recital of facts, and we soon lay aside such a book as dull; when a
                  little imagination combined with reason, enables us to see into the spirit of the
                  work, and we peruse it with an interest that every chapter increases."</p>
               <p>"I don't see how anybody, who pretends to be religious, can countenance novel
                  writing. The Scriptures command us not to lie, and when we write or speak
                  something that is not strictly true, even if the foundation be a reality, what is
                  it but a polished falsehood?"</p>
               <p>"Our Savior talked in parables," said Mrs. Goodwin.</p>
               <p>"When I get too religious to read a well written story of a pure nature, then I'll
                  be too pious to read a story beginning with, 'A certain sower went forth to sow,'
                  or the equally romantic one of Lazarous at the rich man's gate. There is also on
                  record, a vivid sketch of exalted imagination, which you can find in the Book of
                  Revelations. After writing many endearing greetings to his Christian friends, John
                  begins in this wise: 'I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day; and I heard behind me
                  a great voice as of a trumpet, saying 'I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the
                  last. <emph>And what thou see'st write in a book,</emph> and send it unto the
                  seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto
                  Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto philadelphia, and unto
                  Laodicea. And I turned to see the voice that spake with me." The rest of what
                  John, in the isle of Patmos recorded, you may find, as I said before, in the book
                  of Revelations. Now, if John had been too pious to pen his gifted ideas and lofty
                  conceptions, and transcribe the thoughts which have entranced their thousands,
                  where would have been the Revelations which we as Christians so highly prize?"</p>
               <p>"But John actually <emph>saw</emph> what he described."</p>
               <p>"I admit it; but had you or I been standing there, we could not have seen the
                  glories that were revealed to him."</p>
               <p>"Do you consider fictitious writing an inspiration?"</p>
               <p>"I consider John's writing a divine inspiration. But romance that are of the
                  earth, though they do not emanate from Deity, certainly come from the inner spirit
                  of the writer. Many have been influenced by John's imagination until belief in his
                  writings has become a certainty to their minds."</p>
               <p>"Don't <emph>you</emph> believe in the Revelations?"</p>
               <p>"Most certainly, I do. I believe that John's inner being was so illumined by the
                  power of God, that the <emph>saw</emph> what none of us since his day have been
                  permitted to see upon the earth; unless, indeed a glimps of the glory that awaits
                  him is often granted to the dying Christian."</p>
               <p>"I don't see what reference all this has to novel writing."</p>
               <p>"I admit that I have wandered a little from the beaten path of argument, but will
                  return to the point, lay aside all deviations, and I will tell you: A person of
                  correct taste and pure imagination is possessed of a thought. His mind<pb
                     n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6333-00000053"/> runs upon the idea till fancies are
                  multiplied, and new visions created, and the he sees far down through the dim
                  past, and into the shadowy future, visions of things past, of things present, of
                  things to come. Others have not seen the light as he sees it; and with his pen, an
                  instrument more powerful than the sword—an invention more mighty than steam, he
                  controls the minds of many of the tried and suffering of earth, he relates with
                  exact precision. He exposes folly, subdues error, and exalts virtue as with a
                  magic wand, and multitudes are blessed and enlivened by his visions.</p>
               <p>"It particularly belongs to woman to portray the sufferings, hopes, and comforts
                  of human nature. She is properly prevented by the rules of society from public
                  speaking, or filling public stations. Her purest element is in her domestic
                  affairs and peaceful retirement. When in the solitude of her chamber, or in the
                  shades of the grand wood-land bower, she can meditate and pen her ideas; and when
                  suitably arranged, she may send them forth to the world, as blessings to the tried
                  and suffering of earth; as companions to the happy, or as messengers that speak of
                  hope and mercy to the erring. When you or any one else can show me a command
                  prohibiting us to use imagination, but enforcing the strictest display of
                  reason—both of which are inestimable gifts of the Most High; then, and not till
                  then, will I stand corrected."</p>
               <p>"But the trash that floods our world in the form of passionate love and murder
                  stories which inflame the passions and lead thoughtless persons astray: Do you
                  uphold such reading as that?"</p>
               <p>"I was not speaking of such reading. Of course, when the adversary found that
                  folks would <emph>read,</emph> he did all in his power to poison books; but all
                  the filthy trash that has been or will be set afloat, will not annihilate one pure
                  thought that a virtuous imagination has entrusted to the winds and waves of public
                  opinion. They may overrun and obscure the upright genius for a while; but the more
                  pure gold has been rubbed by chalk, the brighter it will shine. '<emph>Pure</emph>
                  gold is indestructible.'"</p>
               <p>"O, well," sighed Mrs. Mays, devoutly, "'Ephraim is joined to his idols, let him
                  alone.' I've done what I could to suppress wickedness. I'm going to retire to
                  rest. I tried to persuade Mr. Mays to go ahead this morning and leave the sick
                  folks; I think its wicked to throw ourselves into danger, but he would stay,
                  though we may lose our lives by it."</p>
               <p>The self-righteous woman removed from the company with a motion that said, "I
                  thank God that I am not a other folks are." <q>

               <head type="sub">THE BURIAL.</head>
               <p>MORNING dawned in silvery brightness upon the level plain. Just as the golden
                  sun-rays peeped over an eastern hill, Welden and O'Donaldson the antelope hunters
                  returned. They had lost themselves the evening before, and could not find the way
                  in, though but a few miles from camp. They had been successful in hunting, having
                  dispatched two of the graceful animals, but they were imperfectly versed in
                  mountain lore, and the time occupied in dressing the meat was so<pb n="106-107"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000054"/> protracted, that the shades of evening came upon
                  them before they were ready to return. They became confused and could not find
                  their way back through the darkness, and for the first time in their lives, they
                  bivouaced upon the hills; without other covering than the clothes they wore. They
                  had a faithfull guide however, when the smoke from the morning camp-fires began to
                  ascend from the valleys, and they soon reached the camp.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Welden suffered much from anxiety during the night, but a hunt is an
                  uncertain enterprise, and no one else thought seriously of their absence.</p>
               <p>"Now, for a change in our <emph>grub,</emph>" exclaimed the Captain. "I tell ye
                  what it is, folks; if all of ye had been as used as I have, to greasin' yer
                  stomachs with bacon, ye wouldn't cave in on this trip. Ye've eat so much fruit an'
                  vegetables all yer lives, that good, wholesome food's too strong for yer sickly
                  stomachs. Ye'll see if my folks don't make the riffle."</p>
               <p>"If we had taken the precaution to prepare fruits and vegetables for this journey,
                  we would be healthy here as elsewhere," said Maurice. "It is presuming upon the
                  laws of nature to undertake a journey like this, in the hottest season of the
                  year, depending wholly upon superfine flour, rusty bacon, and at best, a little
                  dried fruit and rice. We might live through a winter upon such diet, but the idea
                  of being healthy, under a burning summer's sky, with a regimen of this kind, is
                  simply preposterous."</p>
               <p>"<emph>You</emph> might be healthy without hog meat, but <emph>I'd</emph> run down
                  without it, mighty quick."</p>
               <p>"So does the drunkard or tobacco-chewer who gives up his long continued stimulants
                  but that doesn't prove that they are healthy."</p>
               <p>"May-be not, to your fancy, as you don't use 'em; but I tell ye what, pies and
                  gingerbread's poor livin' in my eye."</p>
               <p>"And mine too, Captain Gray. I uphold the use of pure, and unfermented food.
                  Especially should we be careful in summer to avoid bile-increasing luxuries. The
                  nearer our stomachs become cleansed of improper food and drink, the nearer we
                  approach the goal of good health, which our Creator desires us to enjoy."</p>
               <p>"Well, may-be yer right, an' may-be ye aint. This is the wrong time to argue the
                  matter, an' we'll dry up."</p>
               <p>"We'll be compelled to eat something during the trip, and as bacon constitutes
                  half our bill of fare, I expect to eat considerable scrofula this summer; but I
                  shall not eat full allowance at any time."</p>
               <p>Captain Gray and Maurice had been digging the graves, and a call, to breakfast
                  ended the conversation.</p>
               <p>No coffins could be procured, but heavy bed-clothes were used in their stead. The
                  clods descended with a muffled sound upon the quilted linings of the last resting
                  places of the sleepers. Tears of heart-rending sorrow were shed by the bereaved
                  widow, who so much needed her husband's affection in the new mother life in which
                  she had been left, us aided, save by the hand of Him who is and will be a Father
                  to the fatherless, a husband to the desolate widow. Symopathizing sobs escaped the
                  breasts of the bystanders, who had so lately been thrown in the company of the
                  mourners. The last sad rites were over, and Captain Gray's Company prepared for
                  further journeyings.</p>
               <p>The roads, which had been so good from the Missouri rivers thus far as to cause
                  many to complain of the misrepresentations of earlier travellers, gradually became
                  more hilly and sandy. The atmosphere was sultry and oppressive in the extreme. The
                  water of the river was poor; that of the smaller streams every day grew worse.
                  Sometimes a dozen fresh graves were passed in a single day. In many places<pb
                     n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6333-00000055"/> alkali covered the ground, and great
                  care was necessary to keep the cattle from being poisoned.</p>
               <p>On one of these discouraging days, Ada writes:</p>
               <p>"Our weary way seems gloomy and forbidding, but amidst all the obstacles that
                  arise in our path, one hope seems to inspire us all; that of one day reaching the
                  place of our destination. Every day of fatigue and travel brings us nearer the
                  haven of our fast cooling ambition. May Heaven protect and guide us. Where other
                  folks have gone, we certainly can go; at any rate we think so, and having passed
                  the rubicon, we must advance.</p>
               <p>"June 12th. We see the wildest and most romantic scenery to-day that I have yet
                  beheld. Columns above columns of sandstone bluffs, worn by the hard winds of this
                  region, into fantastical appearances of images and massive buildings, are gazed
                  upon in wonder and admiration. They appear like ruins of magnificent castles and
                  palaces, around which many idols are stationed.</p>
               <p>"This evening, a difference of opinion arose among some of the company about the
                  distance to the foot of a bluff which did not appear to be more than a half mile
                  from the road. Wishing to settle the dispute, which was waxing rather warm, and
                  satisfy their curiosity, three of the men went to the bluff, and upon measuring
                  the distance, it was found to be more than two miles. They carried some dry wood
                  from the bluffs, which came to hand very opportunely, as no chips could be
                  found.</p>
               <p>"June 13th. At noon, we for the first time hailed a natural structure, known as
                  Nebraska Court House. This massive pile of rock looks as if it might be the ruins
                  of some collossal edifice. It is situated on the south side of the Platte, and
                  rises up as if to mock the plainer scenery around it with its bold front and
                  majestic proportions. In the afternoon we came in sight of the long looked for
                  Chimney Rock. It at first appeared as a tall spire in the blue distance, pointing
                  towards the heavens. But as we approached nearer to it, the spire appeared to
                  enlarge, and looked more like a chimney extending high above a dome shaped
                  building. A writer very correctly describes it as appearing like a mammoth
                  hay-stack, with an enormous pole projecting far above the top.</p>
               <p>"A hard storm of wind and sand, reminding one of descriptions of the simoons of
                  Sahara, came up about six o'clock. But little rain felt, and we had no thunder and
                  lightning, but the wind rocked the wagons almost hard enough to upset them. A tent
                  was blown over and the many laughs and jests occasioned by the predicament its
                  inmates were left in, made us all forget for a time to regard the fury of the
                  storm. Our Irishman, as usual considered himself the most conspicuous man in the
                  crowd. His exclamations of "Howly mother protect us! by me faith, an' were in for
                  it! och Moses, an' me hat's gone," and other, similar remarks, made the gravest
                  laugh at him when the storm was over.</p>
               <p>"June 14th. Travelled all day in sight of Chimney Rock. Our guides say that it is
                  three hundred feet in height, though it does not appear to us to be half so high.
                  We are encamped this evening near. Scott's Bluffs, where tradition says a man was
                  left by his companions to die, in compliance with his own request. His fellow
                  travellers were without food, and knowing that he could not live, he begged them
                  to abandon him to save their own lives. A party, when crossing the bluffs some
                  time afterwards, found the bones of a man some distance from the place where the
                  unfortunate traveller had last been seen. A light shower fell this afternoon and
                  the evening is pleasant.</p>
               <p>"June 15th. Journeyed all day in sight of Scott's Bluffs. Cedar groves are
                  scattered over them, which in comparison with the sterile scenery every where
                  else, gives them an enlivening appearance. Hailed Laramie's Peak to-day. About ten
                  o'clock we passed Bald Hill Smith's company who were consigning to the dust the
                  body of a man who had been dead about two hours. They had buried his wife a few
                  days before. Andy Billens was sick and begged them to lie by for him, but Captain
                  Smith says he'll not wait for him, if he does die. He appeared much affected when
                  he saw the Baker children. Captain Gray took the rather uncharitable pains to say,
                  so that Audy could hear him, "that there was no need of hauling along a dog like
                  him," though he said afterwards, that if he had known how sick he was he would not
                  have said it. The poor fellow is frightened and we do not think he will recover.
                  Maurice says that he may live a month. He is dreadfully salivated. I do wonder
                  that folk will continue to tamper with so dangerous a drug. His face and mouth are
                  badly swollen, and the exhalations from his putrid gums and throat, proved too
                  disagreeable even for me to bear, and I am accused by many of having neither
                  nerves or stomach. Captain Smith says that spirits of turpentine has no
                  perceptible effect upon his mouth. He can take his mouth full of it with an
                  agreeable sensation.<ref rend="super" target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001"
                     >*</ref> He talks some but with great difficulty. Mrs. Welden, in the true

                  mind with the necessity of repentance. He cursed, a bitter oath that made my blood
                  curdle! Poor fellow! Why is he so hardened?</p>
               <p>"June 18th. As we a seen the Platte valley, the scenery grows more beautiful than
                  any we have beheld for days. We have seen no timber worth mentioning for the last
                  two hundred miles, until to day. We now have an eye-feast of a dense forest that
                  skirts the river bank for miles.</p>
               <p>"June 19th. We passed Fort Laramie to-day. I am almost ashamed to confess it, but
                  I crept in the wagon and went to sleep and did not see the Fort. It is on the
                  south side of the river. We see but few Indians, but the few that come to our
                  wagons are very friendly. They are anxious to purchase old clothing, and a present
                  of some common article of wearing apparel, transports them into ecstacies. Poor
                  creatures! They are so degraded that my native philanthropy struggles hard with a
                  desire to do them good. An Indiana agent, who belongs to the Fort, says it's
                  casting pearls before swine, to try to teach or civilize them, but I can't satisfy
                  philanthropy with that argument. Query. Wouldn't it be well for out missionaries
                  to took more to the welfare of these benighted sons and daughters of America,
                  instead of crossing the seas to find Heathenism?"</p>

               <p>MRS. GOODWIN seldom displayed such eloquent enthusiasm as she evinced upon that
                  long to be remembered night of the "wake". As soon as Ada could find her alone,
                  she thanked her from the fulness of her heart, for the stand she had taken in
                  behalf of pure imagination. They were sitting together in front of Mrs. Goodwin's
                  wagon, one evening, several days after the burial. A subdued the tranquil light
                  beamed from the widow's eyes. She was watching alternately ly, the clear, liquid
                  blue of the zenith, and the white and golden clouds of the western horizon.</p>
               <p>"I don't know why it is," she murmured, in a musical tone, "that I fell so calm,
                  so completely happy of late. Those clouds appear to me like so many
                  stepping-stones to the Eternal world. I feel a kind of peaceful bliss that I never
                  felt before. Can it be that eternity is near me? Last night in my dreams, my
                  husband came to me, and oh! the joy that his coming inspired in my heart! It was
                  indescribable. His presence has been with me all day, and I almost fancy that I
                  can see him smiling from yonder cloud."</p>
               <p>Are you ill" O, mercy! Mrs. Goodwin, what <emph>is</emph> the matter?" said Ada. A
                  sudden pallor had overspread the widow's face, and a stifled groan escaped her.
                  She trembled a moment and sank back in convulsive crampings upon the bed in her
                  wagon.</p>
               <p>Throughout the night, the many friends of the beloved woman, stood around and
                  ministered of her sufferings. So completely had she won their regard, that there
                  was not a person in the company, who would not have risked life itself for her
                  sake.</p>
               <p>Morning dawned, and still she suffered terribly. Everything that love could prompt
                  was done for her, but the disease had been doing its hidden work of destruction
                  for days. Her constitution gave way under the terrible struggle, and life waned
                  rapidly. The organs of speech had been locked for hours. The naturally thin face
                  grew livid, the pale blue eyes were turned heavenwards, and a partly transparent
                  film covered the sightless orbs. Pain at last left her body, and the weakness that
                  precedes a death by cholera, took possession of her exhausted frame. The tongue
                  was loosed and in a whisper that sunk deep into the hears of her sorrowing
                  children, she spoke of Hope, of Heaven, of Rest.</p>
               <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6333-00000057"/>
               <p>"Ma! oh ma!" said Willie, bending over his mother's head, as Ada held him up,
                  "don't you love Willie, ma!"</p>
               <p>The dying woman motioned for a kiss. The little fellow kissed her lovingly, and
                  turning round to Ada with a satisfied air, he exclaimed, "Mother
                     <emph>loves</emph> me, and I <emph>loves</emph> her."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Bless his little life,</emph>" and the pure minded woman spoke no more. A
                  gleam of hope overspread her face and lit up the glassy eyes. she extended her
                  hands to Herbert and Effie. A gentle, prolonged pressure of the cold, skeleton
                  fingers, upon the full, warm plans of her children, a radiant smile, an inaudible
                  whisper, and the mother left her dependent ones to the care of Him who has said in
                  His Word, "When thy father and thy mother forsake thee, then the Lord will take
                  thee up." <q>

               <p>Herbert went alone to where the open grave stood ready to receive its dead; and in
                  the waning twilight, he traced his chastened thoughts upon the leaves of his
                  private journal:</p>
               <p>"June 20th. We little thought when the last Sabbath's pleasant sun shed upon us
                  his congenial rays, that when the next blest day should come, we would be mourning
                  the sickness and death of a be-loved mother! But it has been even so. She was
                  attacked last evening by the pestilence that shadows our journeyings. This
                  afternoon between four and five o'clock, her wearied spirit took its flight, and
                  then we realized that we were bereft indeed. How like a poisoned dagger in my
                  breast burns the remembrance of by-gone scene. O! if a life of usefulness, a life
                  of upright dealing before God and man, could explate the follies of my youth,
                  could atone for one thoughtless act of mine, towards that best of mothers, how
                  gladly would I make restitution for the past! <q>

               <p>"June 21st. What a deep stillness ruled our camping-ground this morning! Men and
                  women moved with stealthy footsteps over the beaten turf, as if fearful of
                  breaking the silence of the hallowed place. We this morning paid the last tribute
                  of respect to the remains of my loved, lamented mother. The place of her interment
                  is a romantic one, that seems an appropriate resting place for the remains of a
                  lover of rural scenery, The grave is situated upon an eminence, overlooking a
                  basin of several acres in extent, dotted over with groves of dwarf pine and cedar
                  trees. In the center of this basin is a spring of icy coldness, clear as crystal.
                  Numerous wild rose bushes, that load the air with delicious perfumes, add beauty
                  to the scene. And on an eminence, where all this can be viewed at a single glance,
                  reposes the last earthly remains of my mother."</p>
               <p>There are hurried movements and terror-stricken voices again in the Gray camp.
                  What is the matter? Why are those anxious persons crowding around a covered
                  carriage, that has this moment halted? Now we can see. Do your utmost, ye
                  ill-fated adventurers, for Death, on the pale horse is abroad, and his glance is
                  terrible! Woe to those whose account with their final Judge is still unreckoned;
                  for the pestilence that walketh in darkness and wasteth at non-day has entered
                  your ranks, and there are few families in which there shall not be one dead!</p>
               <p>"His days are numbered," said Maurice, in a solemn voice. "My dear Mrs. Welden,
                  your husband is past recovery.</p>

               <p>"Nerve yourself to bear this severe trial for the sake of your little ones."</p>
               <p>"O, if I could look back with pleasure upon the years of our married life! O, can
                  I not beg his pardon for the trouble I have given him?"</p>
               <p>"See, he revives," said Ada.</p>
               <p>"O, John!"</p>
               <p>"Meggie?"</p>
               <p>"Light of my existence, must you go?"</p>
               <p>"Look."</p>
               <p>The sufferer raised his finger toward Heaven. Fleecy clouds of diamond whiteness,
                  set in gold and blue, were piled in floating, gorgeous heaps upon the upper air.
                  One little cerulean spot, directly over the head of the dying man, was unobscured
                  by clouds.</p>
               <p>"Look, Meggie, It's pleasant to die at such a time as this. Don't weep for me.

               <p>He patted the dimpled cheeks and smoothed the glossy curls of his darling. A shade
                  of darkness crossed his face, but was instantly dispelled.</p>
               <p>"I trust."</p>
               <p>"'<hi rend="i"/>When thy father and thy mother forsake thee, then the Lord will
                  take thee up,'" said Herbert to Celia and Howard, remembering his mother's often
                  quoted text.</p>
               <p>"Thank God," said the sufferer, fervently.</p>
               <p>"O, John, can you forgive the many errors of the past? Do tell me that you love
                  me!'</p>
               <p>'Meggie," his words were uttered in broken sentences, "I do forgive; can you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, dear; but I can't forget how cross I've been with you."</p>
               <p>"Look ahead, Meggie."</p>
               <p>A severe and prolonged struggle between life and death, a pointing of the bony
                  finger toward the clear spot in the sky, a stifled moan, and all was still.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Another had read the Mystery.</p>
               <p>"O, tell me, is this death?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Welden yielded for a time to the passionate impulses of her nature, and
                  refused to be comforted. Ada prevailed upon her to go with her away from the
                  bustle and confusion of the camping-ground. They proceeded through the tangled
                  mats of prickly pears and thorny grease-wood, to a distant cluster of rose bushes,
                  that gave out delicious odors upon the desert air. The bereaved woman sat down
                  upon the ground and looked heavenwards. Fleecy, gorgeous clouds were crowding upon
                  and overwrapping each other, and while she gazed, one light veil of azure tint
                  closed up the only bright blue opening that had been visible in the zenith for an
                  hour.</p>
               <p>"What a vision!" said Ada. "What a theme for contemplation can be drawn from the
                  observance of this simple circumstance! Simple, because so often seen, but
                  important now, in leading the chastened imagination to blissful theories."</p>
               <p>A meadow lark settled upon a rose bush near them. A flood of song, pure,
                  delicious, enchanting, was poured from it happy, swelling breast, into the hearts
                  of the mourner and comforter. Both listened in silence, unwilling to break the
                  pleasing carol of the inspired songster. The dulcet vespers arose upon the evening
                  air for a few moments, and then the warbler, as if well pleased with his attempt
                  and success as comforter, flitter away. They watched his receding flight in
                  silence, until his tiny form disappeared in the distance. Mrs. Welden looked at
                  Ada with beaming, tearless eyes. Ada grasped the mourner's hand, but felt so
                  deeply awed by the stillness that mantled them, that she could not trust herself
                  to speak. Each read the other's thoughts, and feared<pb n="116-117"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000059"/> to break the hallowed stillness, lest the inner
                  vision would be obscured. At length Mrs. Welden spoke:</p>
               <p>"Oh! Ada, it is selfish to desire the return of those who are happy in the realms
                  of bliss, but, oh! how the carnal nature clings to inanimate clay! Must the form
                  of my dear husband be laid beneath the sod? My Father—God of my husband—God of my
                  mother—sustain me, or I perish!"</p>
               <p>Ada pointed to the thirteenth verse of the fourteenth chapter of Revelations. The
                  mourner read:</p>
               <p>"'And I heard a voice from Heaven, saying unto me, write, blessed are the dead
                  which die in the Lord. Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors
                  and their works do follow them.</p>
               <p>"'And I looked and behold a white cloud; and upon the cloud one sat, like unto the
                  Son of Man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.</p>
               <p>"'And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice. Thrust in
                  thy sickle and reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.'"</p>
               <p>Another listener, unobserved by Ada or Mrs. Welden, had treasured up, and
                  stereotyped upon her soul, every word of their conversation, and each syllable of
                  Divine Inspiration. Effie, who, since her mother's death had been silent and
                  thoughtful, and had lost all the childish glee of her artless disposition, had
                  been reclining for an hour, not far from the chosen seat of Ada and Mrs. Welden,
                  under the shade of a large sage bush. Not wishing to disturb them, she had said
                  nothing until Mrs. Welden stopped reading. She then rushed forward, threw herself
                  into her arms and sobbed as if her heart were breaking. Ada spoke words of comfort
                  to both, little dreaming that bitter trials were in store for her. Trials of the
                     <emph>heart,</emph> such as, thank Heaven, few, save those who can
                     <emph>endure,</emph> have ever experienced.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE SEPARATION.</head>
               <p>MR. AND MRS. MANSFIELD had retired to the shades of thickly growing sage brush to
                  consider an important matter, out of the reach of listeners.</p>
               <p>"I believe," said Mansfield, "that Maurice and Ada have become attached to each
                  other. I must acknowledge that I have great esteem for Maurice. He is well
                  informed and respectably connected, but he is poor. Ada ought to know that we
                  cannot countenance their union. I fear to mention it to her, for opposition is the
                  stimulant of affection. Had we not better leave the company and travel alone? She
                  would then be away from him entirely, and would not know that we had a motive in
                  separating them. We can tell the Captain what is true; that we can travel faster
                  alone, and he will not suspect another motive. I would not willingly do violence
                  to Ada's feelings; but the education and accomplishments we have lavished upon
                  her, will seen to be labor lost, is she marries a poor man. Love won't feed and
                  clothe her."</p>
               <p>"Would it be right for us to intrigue against them, Henry? Ada is reasonable, and
                  if we talk to her candidly about the matter, she will do as we request. Be
                  careful, or you will treat her as injudiciously as Welden used to treat his
                  wife."</p>
               <p>"But every-day life and ideal attachment are different. She is impulsive, and it
                  would all be owing to the state of her feelings in the matter now, whether such a
                  talk would have the desired effect or not. I prefer leaving the train and getting
                  her out of Maurice's company. If she doesn't see him again, she'll soon forget
                  him."</p>
               <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6333-00000060"/>
               <p>Mrs. Mansfield did not oppose her husband further. He seldom differed with her in
                  opinion, and when he did, she would give up the disputed point with but feeble
                  resistance or argument. Neither of them knew of the depth of the "great deep" of
                  their daughter's heart. They had been married when young; had had no opposition in
                  the current of their affection, and because they had never been
                     <emph>tried,</emph> they knew nothing of the tenacity with which the shooting
                  and growing tendrils of loving hearts will cling to, and intertwine with each
                  other, no matter how strongly adverse waves may strive to part them. Marriage with
                  them was a matter of business and policy. If their daughter could choose a man of
                  wealth and worth, all would be well; but upon no other condition could they
                  countenance a matrimonial alliance.</p>
               <p>It was O'Donaldson's turn to go ahead with his wagon. The carriages kept no
                  regular place, because, as the mules could out-travel the oxen, Mansfield and
                  Welden would drive ahead and wait for the wagons, while the mules were grazing.
                  Mrs. Welden had been a widow three days and had been compelled to be her own
                  driver. Ada had driven for her part of the time, and the two were much together.
                  Mansfield's teams were ready, but some of Daddy Green's cattle could not be easily
                  caught.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to leave you, Captain; but I am confident that we can move faster by
                  going in smaller companies. As my teams are ready to go ahead, if you have no
                  objection, I will travel alone."</p>
               <p>"Very well. I don't solicit nobody's company; never asked ye to travel with me, no
                  how."</p>
               <p>Captain Gray was secretly disappointed, but the Kentucky blood was hot in his
                  veins, and as he expressed to his wife, he was "independent as a hog on ice."</p>
               <p>"Can't I be in Ada's company any more?" Effie asked.</p>
               <p>"O, Yes, you'll see each other every few days," said Mansfield field, who
                  nevertheless, had secretly determined to get ahead and keep ahead. To say that he
                  felt awkward, embarrassed and guilty, would be saying no more than the truth.
                  Deception was out of his line of business, and it was no easy matter for him to
                  practice it successfully, Action and conscience alike betrayed him, and all saw in
                  a twinkling the true cause of his desire to get away from them.</p>
               <p>"Pa, we influenced Mrs. Welden to undertake this journey. Her husband has been
                  taken from her. Will it be right for us to leave her now, when she has had such
                  severe affliction?"</p>
               <p>"If Maurice is the man we hope is, <emph>he</emph> will take care of her."</p>
               <p>"But I thought to help her drive her team. You know that there is no one to drive
                  her mules. Suppose she gets sick, what will become of her?"</p>
               <p>"It does look too bad, Henry," interposed his wife.</p>
               <p>"My stakes are set!" he answered sternly. "Come! get in the carriage, we must go
                  on."</p>
               <p>Ada took affectionate leave of her friends, in whose bereavement she had proved so
                  great a comforter. Tears were in her eyes when she kissed Effie with a murmured
                  "good bye." Mrs. Welden wept. Ada's own heart was beating a loud tattoo of mingled
                  strugglings, but forgetful of her own misery, she strove to comfort her
                  friends.</p>
               <p>"Good, bye, Maurice." Her voice was husky and eyes humid. Since the first evening
                  of their journeying west of the Missouri River, they had not spoken of their
                  feelings towards each other, but each had read the other's heart, and built up
                  cherished fancies of the misty future. He looked at her with a searching glance,
                  as though he longed for words of hers to strengthen his hope. She read deep
                  tenderness and undying affection in his thrilling look and gave him her hand. He
                  did not speak, but pressed it to his heart. She<pb n="120-121"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000061"/> cast a meaning look of bitter triumph towards her
                  father, who appeared oblivious to everything but his mules.</p>
               <p>"I'll have to leave <emph>you</emph> behind, will I?" he said at length. Her
                  father had never spoken so sternly to her before.</p>
               <p>"Read the sixteenth and seventeenth verses of the first chapter of Ruth," said
                  Ada, as she left the side of her betrothed. Affianced they were, not in word, but
                  in heart and soul. Each felt the hallowed force of this affinity, and it was
                  binding as if the vow had been sealed by a legal ceremony.</p>
               <p>Mansfield felt ill at ease. His wife knew that she had committed a wrong against
                  her daughter, though the depth of the suffering she had helped to inflict she
                  could not discern.</p>
               <p>Ada was pale, but cheerful, and strove to perform her duty towards her parents and
                  the orphan children, the same as before. She did not talk, walk, or read, as had
                  been her habit, but would sit in the carriage for hours, gazing upon the changing
                  scenery as they rolled along, and often would not speak until she had been
                  repeatedly addressed.</p>
               <p>Her parents noticed her altered mien with vexation and sorrow. Her last words to
                  Maurice had set them to thinking and planning deliberately about what course to
                  pursue. Ada saw that they read her inward sighings and did not try to work upon
                  their feelings one way or another. She trusted in her lover and felt certain that
                  all would come right in due time. She would gladly have shared her hew and holy
                  emotions of spirit with her parents, but she saw that this was impossible. And
                  thus she learned her first lesson of deceit. If they had been kind to her as
                  formerly, her draught of bitterness would have been more easily quaffed; but she
                  saw that they blamed her for the course she had taken, although she felt conscious
                  of having done no wrong. While she rejoiced in her newly awakened sensations, a
                  load of sorrow tugged hourly at her heart, because of her parents censure.</p>
               <p>Maurice was sorely tried. Most of his companions laughed at him about losing his
                  mate, or plied him with impertinent ineuendoes. He enjoyed Herbert's confidence
                  and when camping time arrived, the first evening after the separation, they went
                  together to a grassy nook—to herd the cattle.</p>
               <p>"Have you read the sixteenth and seventeenth verses of the first chapter of Ruth?"
                  Herbert asked.</p>
               <p>"I have had no opportunity to do so yet, but I recollect their import."</p>
               <p>Herbert took a small Bible from his pocket and turned to the place.</p>
               <p>"Entreat me not to leave thee, nor turn from following after thee. Where thou
                  goest will I go, and where thou lodgest will I lodge. Thy people shall be my
                  people, and thy God, my God.</p>
               <p>"The Lord do so to me and more also, if aught but death part thee and me."</p>
               <p>"I glory in her spunk," said Herbert. "It does me good to see her so spirited this
                  morning. If I had known what was to be found in the passage of Scripture to which
                  she alluded, I think I would have been compelled to ejaculate 'bravo!' Mr.
                  Mansfield's a pretty smart man, but a boy who may never be half as old as he is,
                  can tell him that it's no use to try to compel that girl to do wrong."</p>
               <p>"Do you think she would be doing wrong to give me up?"</p>
               <p>"Most certainly, I do. Do you suppose she'll think it's right to server holy
                  bonds, after they've been woven in Heaven?"</p>
               <p>"Why, Herbert, I believe you have a man's head upon your shoulders. I'd rather go
                  to you for counsel than to any of the so-called <emph>wise men</emph> who would
                  crush into dust the holiest yearnings of our inner lives. It looks hardly possible
                  that you could speak as you do, without having experience<pb n="122-123"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000062"/> in matters of the heart. I could not have talked so
                  a year ago."</p>
               <p>"Observation will teach much. My mother trained me aright. Had she lived, and I
                  ever have known your sentiments taken home to myself, I would have consulted her
                  before any one else. What a blessed influence such a mother can exert over her
                  children!"</p>
               <p>"If I live to be a man, her precepts and example, shall guide me in all I
                  undertake."</p>
               <p>"Observe that resolution, Herbert, and you will be a man among men."</p>
               <p>Mansfield had conjectured rightly about the chances for expeditions traveling,
                  being on the side of small companies. The large train come to a bad portion of
                  road, and when one wagon gets through, it has to halt until the number, perhaps a
                  dozen or more, are safely over. The lone wagon can move on after crossing all such
                  place, and the advantage gained by this alone, is remarkable, in a few weeks
                  travel.</p>
               <p>Then, we have know a whole company delayed for hours in the morning, by the
                  disappearance of some body's ox or horse. But this is a digression.</p>
               <p>Ada writes under date of June 25th:—</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"We have a very grand view to-day of a range of bluffs on the south side of the
                     river. They have the appearance of dome-shaped dwellings, churches and every
                     variety of public buildings, seeming as if surrounded by an impenetrable
                     fortress. As we travel on, the illusion is partly dispelled, but the bluffs
                     still wear the same appearance, although not altogether so picturesque and
                     complete.</p>
                  <p>"It is rumored that gold mines of value have been found on the south side of
                     the Platte, on a stream called Deer Greek, and that more than three hundred men
                     have stopped and are digging for the precious ore.</p>
                  <p>"A tragedy was related at our camp this morning, which made my blood run cold.
                     Some men, we did not learn their names, informed us that they had found the
                     body of a man about a hundred miles back, who had been murdered by the
                     roadside. There were two pistol shot and several cuts upon his body inflicted
                     with a bowie-knife. The men say that they had no spade with which to dig a
                     grave, so they straightened the body upon the ground and threw earth and sand
                     over him. No clue had been found as to his identity, or the perpetrators of the
                     deed, though many strongly suspect the men who told us the story to be the
                     guilty parties.</p>
                  <p>"We encamped near a tributary of the Platte, In a lovely cluster of bitter
                     cottonwoods.</p>
                  <p>"June 27th. We travelled along the river until neat noon, when the road turned
                     abruptly to the right and we left he Platte forever. The river water was so
                     much better than when we first became acquainted with the stream, the bed had
                     narrowed and the current become more rapid, and the general appearance of the
                     country had improved so much, that we felt a little sorry to leave the Platte,
                     notwithstanding the complaints often made against it.</p>
                  <p>"It is very lonely travelling without my former associates, but my parent have
                     willed it, and I must submit. They'll feel their error some day. Perhaps, after
                     all, the Lord will overrule this matter for my good. 'Man proposes, but God
                     disposes.'</p>
                  <p>"We are camped opposite the Red Butter. They are about three hundred feet high
                     and the color of well burnt brick. They are lovely, almost grand in appearance,
                     but the musquitoes are so annoying that we have no patience to observe the
                     beauties of nature.</p>
                  <p>"We heard this evening that two men were drowned to-day, when trying to swim
                     the Platte where we last saw it. The current is so rapid and the water so deep
                     and cold, that I wonder that any one will be' fool-hardy' enough to run such a
                     risk. Three other men who entered the stream at the same time, landed safely
                     upon this side. They brought with them some specimens of mica, and from the
                     best conclusions they cloud form, they believe that gold could be found in
                     abundance along Deer Creek, if the mines could be properly worked.</p>
                  <p>"June 28th. We have journeyed over an uninterrupted sage plain all day. In the
                     morning it was sage, at noon sage brush, and this evening it is sage brush
                     trees, or brush about ten feet high, having every appearance of old, gnarled,
                     knotty trees.</p>
                  <p>"Alkale abounds to a great extent, and it requires great vigilance to keep the
                     cattle from drinking standing or slowly running water. We saw beds of saleratus
                     on our right in many places. The marshes where alka abounds emit a very
                     disagreeable odor, but we can pass over such a place in one or two minutes, and
                     are not troubled again till we come to another one. We passed a dozen or more
                     of such marshes to-day.<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6333-00000063"/> We were
                     favored with a light shower this afternoon, and the evening is pleasant.</p>
                  <p>"June 29th. We struck Sweet Water River to-day and enjoyed a splendid view of
                     Independence Rock. Fanny Waters, a young lady from a neighboring train tried
                     with me to climb the Rock, but we had not ascended more than thirty with me to
                     climb the Rock, but we land not ascended more than thirty feet before a hail
                     storm drove us back. When I reached the river, the carriage was across, and
                     O'Donaldson was just driving his cattle to the water's edge. I rode across in
                     the wagon. Pa said he intended to let me wade it, to teach me to keep up with
                     the carriage. He never was cross to me until lately. What can with the
                     carriage. He never was across to me until lately. What can it mean? Does he
                     expect me to break an attachment over which I have no control, by unkind words
                     and bitter fault-findings? I almost rebel against this first iron band that has
                     ever bound me, but I will try to endure it longer if possible.</p>
                  <p>"We encamped near the Devil's Gate, an opening in the everlasting mountains of
                     rock, through which the Sweet Water passes. Ma and I paid this Gate a visit in
                     company with many others, who have encamped here for the night, to hear
                     Highland music reverberating through these massive clifis.</p>
                  <p>"A bagpipe and bulge were the instruments used and I thought that no wonder
                     William Wallance could fire his men with love for freedom, when he seat such
                     music as this through the bold-browed mountains and wild ravines of their
                     romantic mountain home. How I wish Maurice could be hero with his flute. But I
                     dare not breathe such a wish to my parents, who, of all others, ought to
                     receive the full confessions of my longing heart. Is it any wonder that young
                     folks are deceitful, when fathers and mothers will not accept their
                     confidence?</p>
                  <p>"June 30th. We travelled all day up the Sweet Water, between two towering
                     ranges of mountain rocks. We noticed a grave to-day, bearin the inscription:
                     Henry Norton, murdered June 28th. The murderer lies in the next grave. Another
                     bears the inscription: 'Wilson Wintors, hung July 20th, 18'. Only yesterday,
                     this tragedy was consummated! What a warning to the living! Two soul hurried by
                     the hand of violence into the presence of the awful judge! 'It is a fearful
                     thing to fall into the hands of the living God!'</p>
                  <p>"Quarrels, strife, dissensions, blasphemies, evil-speaking and tyranny, seem to
                     have been turned loose upon those that the pestilence has left.</p>
                  <p>"The scenery, grand enough to enchant anybody but a soul-tried emigrant,
                     elevates no one. Every person is tired and fatigued beyond limit of human
                     endurance; and the least spark ignites our combustible ble frames, so that we
                     go off in a paroxysm of fury. It is hard to tell who has the least patience—pa,
                     ma, O'Donaldson, or myself, I heard a man say to-day that the Plains were a
                     testing place for folks' tempers. He said that he could find out just what kind
                     of a man his neighbor was, by taking a trip like this. I told him that his
                     theory was wrong; because persons are <emph>worse</emph> upon these Plains than
                     they are at home. A few stupid people get along well enough, but it's because
                     they haven't energy enough to do otherwise.</p>
                  <p>"The children, Johnny, Dilly and Eda, are capable of teaching us a lesson of
                     forbearance, but we heed their example too little. No wonder murders occur
                     among fighting folks, when those who were never ill-tempered before, are now so
                     pettish and excitable.</p>
                  <p>"July 2nd. Some of the Sweet Water Mountains are covered with snow, though they
                     do not look high enough to be above the snow-line. A chain of the Wind River
                     Mountains are visible ahead of us, Their lofty peaks are crowned with snow,
                     sparkling and glittering in the sunlight, like mountain crowns of opals and
                     topazzes, reflecting amber shades, upon the more unpretending hill-tops, and
                     tinging the far off valleys with a hue of gold. The wind blows very
                     disagreeably and the air is cold enough for frost.</p>
                  <p>"July 3rd. We took a 'cut off' this forenoon, and managed to get ahead of about
                     fifty teams, who had been sending the annoying, never failing dust into our
                     faces all the morning.</p>
                  <p>The feet of our cattle are badly worn. The roads are rocky, and in many places
                     the stones are like sharpened flints. We pass a great many lame and worn out
                     cattle. The air is literally filled with the stench arising from dead oxen.</p>
                  <p>July 4th. While our numerous friends in the States are enjoying the anniversary
                     of our glorious Independence, we are progressing, slowly but weary way. The
                     weather is cold enough for snow. Pat says it's too cold for the feathery flakes
                     to fall. "Don't ye see, Miss Ada, that they're fruz above us?"</p>
                  <p>The grey dull sky, indeed, has that appearance.</p>
                  <p>July 5th. Last night we were visited by a violent hurricane, which upset the
                     tent and rocked the vehicles from side to side. Many cattle and horses
                     stampeded from the different coralls, and some have not been found.</p>
                  <p>"I believe I grow more anxious and miserable every day. Pa and ma do not see
                     it, but if this state of things continue, I shall have to give up in despair. I

               <p>WEARY days passed away; weary emigrants moved one, worn out cattle died, and
                  others became unfit for service;—but Captain Gray's Company jogged slowly on,
                  conquering every obstacle; amid sickness and death upon every hand; lending a
                  helping hand wherever it was needed. Many were they, who learned to bless the name
                  of Dr. Stanton, whose untiring energy and boundless compassion for the suffering,
                  was only equaled by his skill in managing diseases. Many, it is true, were lost,
                  but with few exceptions, those whose constitutions were good, were rescued from
                  the jaws of death and were convalescent in a few days, under his judicious
                  management.</p>
               <p>His utter abhorrence of poisonous drugs, caused many to shun his advice, but his
                  success, compared with that of other physicians, gradually won the confidence of
                  the people.—Camping hours were his only times for practice, as he could not leave
                  Mrs. Welden's ox wagon during the day. He had calls to visit squalid poverty in
                  its most filthy and disgusting gusting appearance, and frequent invitations to
                  visit those in the higher walks of life, whose refinement, contrasted with the
                  beastliness of their fellow travellers, reminded him of the same phases of
                  existence in the populous cities.</p>
               <p>"What a fellow can't help he has to make the most of," he said to Herbert, when he
                  alluded to his former dislike of the physician's calling.</p>
               <p>Capain Gray, in spite of his boasted healthy food, grew dangerously ill. When an
                  iron constitution once becomes overpowered by disease, life hangs upon a
                  thread,—convalesence begins, he improvement is not generally so rapid as in more
                  delicate persons, because the action of disease has been so violent, that nature
                  has a great work to do when restoration commences. For many weeks, the Captain had
                  to lie upon a bed of languishing, and when at last he began to recover, he looked
                  like a shadow of his former self. His wife was compelled to walk and drive his
                  team for weeks. She said that she could endure more than he could, and until their
                  journey was ended, she walked half of the time with the ox-whip upon her shoulder,
                  after the most approved style.</p>
               <p>She awoke Maurice one night, just as he got into the firs sleep he had been
                  permitted to indulge in for thirty-six hours.</p>
               <p>"Jeddy's go to crampin' and seems mighty bad off. I hate to 'wake ye, but if here
                  ain't somehin' done for him, he can't sand it long."</p>
               <p>The boy was indeed suffering terribly. He had been attacked by cholera in its most
                  malignant form. Mrs. Gray examined the victuals which had been set away after
                  supper. His sickness was no mystery. A plate of rusty bacon and a dish of green,
                  wild currants, that Polly had gathered o make pies, had disappeared. It was the
                  first fruit the boy had seen for so long, that he had arisen from his bed when he
                  rest were asleep, to cat the green berries unseen. The<pb n="128-129"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000065"/> quart of berries disappeared, but his insatiate
                  appetite was only whetted. The fried bacon and a cold biscuit were devoured next,
                  and then, fearful of being seen, he crept to the tent. He acknowledged this to his
                  mother, in an easy interval, an hour after his attack. His nature battled with the
                  destroyer to no purpose, and when the weary contest was ended, death had gained
                  the victory.</p>
               <p>Maurice looked long and steadily at the straightened form of the dead. The
                  sun-burnt face was sunken, the lips purple and eyes half closed. The hair, which
                  during life was always intricately tangled, was now composed in smooth waves about
                  the childish brow. He never looked handsome before, but now that the usually dirty
                  face was clean, and the habitually soiled garments exchanged for the snowy shroud,
                  he looked spiritually beautiful.</p>
               <p>"'It is the Lord's doing and it is marvellous in our eyes,'" exclaimed a
                  voice.</p>
               <p>The weeping mother of he departed boy looked up. Mrs. Mays, whom she had no seen
                  since the time when death had visited her own camp, stood before her.</p>
               <p>"Do you really believe that the Lord wills ha those whom. He has created in His
                  image, shall be eat off in the prime of life?" said Maurice.</p>
               <p>"He takes away our friends and children because we sin against him." was the
                  reply.</p>
               <p>"But, are not the sins we commit, often perpetrated against those very friends and
                  children who are taken from us? God has laid down rules for us to follow. We
                  violate those rules with impunity, and sickness and death follow as natural
                  consequences.</p>
               <p>"I am not a Jew, neither am I remotely connected with he descendants of Abraham by
                  any kindred ties of which I am cognizant, but I am ready to prove the fact, that
                  one law of their established ritual should be followed by both Jew and Gentile.
                  Why did Jehovah forbid the Israelites to eat swine, if such abomination is goo for
                  food? Thinking that we know better than our Maker does, what is good for us, we do
                  not profit by His advice to his chosen people; but contract diseases by the use of
                  food which he has expressly forbidden"</p>
               <p>"But He did not command the Gentiles to abstain from pork."</p>
               <p>"Neither did he command us to abstain from <emph>vultures!</emph> We would think
                  vultures as great a luxury as hogs or tobacco, if we'd only learn to eat
                  them."</p>
               <p>"The Almighty did not make hogs for nothing."</p>
               <p>"Very true. Every family can keep a hog fat upon the dirty refuse of he kitchen.
                  The lard is good for soap, candles, and machinery oil. That certainly is enough,
                  but to be economical, we must eat the hog after he has been fatted upon the
                  dirtiest leavings of out sinks and swill-tubs. Buzzard-meat is equally clean."</p>
               <p>'I suppose you lay the foundation of all diseases upon he hog."</p>
               <p>"I lay the <emph>eggraration</emph> of many diseases upon him."</p>
               <p>"You say nothing about the quart of currants this boy devoured."</p>
               <p>"Because <emph>you</emph> blame he currants enough, without my help. Of course,
                  green, uncooked fruit is very destructive to health, but I hold that if that
                  child's stomach had been healthy, the currants would have made him sleep uneasily,
                  and probably have given him a light attack of cholera morbus; but he would have
                  recovered."</p>
               <p>"I said, when folks first began to die on this road, they would have stood it
                  better if they'd been used to bacon. May-be they would, but I've had an over-dose
                  this summer. Hog meat ain't what it's cracked up to be," said Captain Gray, as he
                  drew a deep sigh.</p>
               <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6333-00000066"/>
               <p>"O, merey me!" said Mrs. Gray. "If I don't wish these Plains had'nt never been
                  thought of! My poor Jeddy!"</p>
               <p>"We can't die till our time comes," said Mrs. Mays.</p>
               <p>"'The number of days allotted to man are three score years and ten,'" said
                  Maurice, decidedly. "This is poor comfort, Mrs. Gray. But you surely do not think
                  the Lord would cut us off in the prime of life if we did not violate His laws,
                  when He has said that our days are three score years and ten, unless if by reason
                  of strength they may be four score years. he does not say one thing and mean
                  another, although we often misinterpret His words."</p>
               <p>"Its mighty mysterious to me," said Mrs. Gray.</p>
               <p>"And will be, so long as the laws of nature are daily violated, and you study none
                  of the first, great principles of Hygiene. Too little attention is paid to this
                  mater. I would not speak of this now, but impressions are more apt to be retained
                  when the causes which give them weight are before us, as examples."</p>
               <p>"When I think of my poor boy, now, I wonder that I didn't make him be more careful
                  about his diet. Poor child! I thought he could stand anything. He always had sich
                  a <emph>dreadful</emph> appetite." Maurice left them and Mrs. Mays comforted them
                  by continuing to blame the Giver of life.</p>
               <p>She afterwards asked his how he could explain away the words of Inspiration, "The
                  Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord."</p>
               <p>"I don't explain it away, Madam. Indeed, the name of the Most High is thrice
                  blessed, if when he has witnessed our disregard of what is right, he removes the
                  innocent objects of out shortcomings, and transplants them to a higher sphere,
                  where everything is under His more immediate control. If you have read your Bible
                  much, you know that David's child was the offspring of sin; he knew that God's
                  laws had been violated and submitted manfully to the punishment."</p>
               <p>"I'd like to know what's to become of religion, if folks are going to explain away
                  the mysteries of early death."</p>
               <p>"I tell you Madam, the day is coming when not one child's death will be recorded
                  without it can be traced to causes perfectly plain. To accident—to which all are
                  liable—to improper diet and habits, the culpable neglect of parents or the use of
                  poisonous medicines. With our knowledge of the cause, will come the development of
                  the cure."</p>
               <p>Mrs. May's usual retreat under difficult argument, was her self-complacent shield,
                  "Lord help the rising generation. I've done what I could to suppress wickedness,"
                  and she withdrew to her own quarters.</p>
               <p>The burial was conducted after the fashion of all the others, though the sadly
                  thinned ranks of the company, spread additional gloom over the hearts of the
                  sorrowful mourners.</p>
               <p>The deceased boy's place was vacant. His post had been as useful as that of the
                  ablest ox driver in the train, and the mule, which he had abused and caressed
                  alternately, was without a friend or persecutor. Somebody must be hired to drive
                  the rapidly increasing band of cattle unfit for service, and Mr. Mays permitted a
                  boy of his, about twelve years of age to travel with them and occupy he post that
                  Jeddy had lately filled with constant vigilance, and all went on as before. The
                  sad void, left in the hearts of parents and sister, was invisible to the common
                  travelling throng and, <q>

               <p>JULY 12TH. GREEN RIVER rolls before us. A beautiful stream to look at, but the
                  crossing is very difficult unless managed. There was a good ferry boat in
                  readiness and we were taken across with but little delay. The cattle were made to
                  swim, an occupation which does not appear to suit them, as we often have trouble
                  in foreign them to take water.</p>
               <p>"There is trading post near the ferry, where sickly looking vegetables are sold at
                  ruinous prices. A world in miniature is here. Folks are swearing and gambling at
                  one encampment; music and dancing is the pastime a another; and a third, a
                  collection of emigrants are holding a prayer meeting.</p>
               <p>"Indians of the Shoshonee tribe are encamped near us. They are loathsome objects
                  of degraded humanity, being clothed in bear and buffalo skins that are alive with
                  vermin. they appear to have no more sense or energy than infants a few weeks old.
                  Some of the squaws are very aged and infirm. They are well treated by the younger
                  squaws in everything but clothing, and that is as good as the most of them can
                  afford for themselves.</p>
               <p>"This is a dreadful world, or rather the degradation and misery of our mundane
                  sphere are terrible. The moon and stars above us look delightful; the roaring
                  river is inspiring; the mountain crag, and valley scenery is surpassingly
                  lovely,—but humanity, wretched and wicked into what depths of vice and ignorance
                  will it not blindly plunge!</p>
               <p>"July 14th. We have jolted over rocky hills, from sunrise to sunset. We passed
                  several beautiful springs. I noticed in particular a small stream that rises in
                  mountain near the road. It measures thirteen inches in both width and depth, has a
                  pebbly bottom and runs very swiftly. The banks are not more than eighteen inches
                  apart at the top, and are five feet high, adorned with hedges of sage, rose bushes
                  and grease wood. We encamped on the west side of Ham's Fork of Green River. This
                  is a clear, swift, fordable stream, with a gravelly bottom.</p>
               <p>"July 15th. The country is very mountainous. The Devil's Back Bone—they have
                  uncouth names for beautiful scenery upon these Plains—was the first difficulty to
                  be surmounted. his Bone is a mountain of sand and rocks, and is destitute of
                  vegetation, unless stinted sage brush deserve the name. Upon the summit, we found
                  a quantity of white limestone and some specimens of quartz. After descending Back
                  Bone, we struck a comparatively level country, over which we travelled for a few
                  miles, when we again encountered mountains and did not leave them until night.</p>
               <p>"We passed through a lovely grove of firs, upon the summit of a lofty peak, which
                  inspired us with renewed animation, as forest trees had become to us as vague
                  remembrances of the things that were. In the afternoon we descended a long, steep
                  and rocky ridge of the Bear River Mountain, from whose summit we viewed, according
                  to our guides, Bear River Valley Creek. The written name looks like a long one,
                  but nothing could be more comprehensive or appropriate than these four little
                  words. The Bear River Valley, though beautiful, looks wild enough to be the
                  lurking place of animals of the name; and the Greek, running swiftly in its
                  meandering course through the Valley, dividing it into halves, breaking through
                  rough defiles of rock, and dashing through mountain gorges, above and below the
                  Valley, has an appearance decidedly 'Bearish.'</p>
               <p>"We travelled ten miles without unlocking the wagon wheels. Effie and Willie each
                  walked the ten miles, because they were afraid to ride.</p>
               <p>"Poor Mrs. Welden had a hard time with her carriage. Mrs. Sam Green took care of
                  the two children. The mules were unmanageable, and their intrepid driver journeyed
                  all day in imminent peril. She bears her unfortunate bereavement with the calmness
                  of despair and the fortitude of a heroine.</p>
               <p>"When I feel disposed to murmur at my own trials, I look at her and feel resigned.
                  Maurice is very attentive and kind, but one team is all he can manage, and she is
                  compelled to drive her carriage over the most dangerous roads, without assistance.
                  We were visited in the evening by a violent hail-storm. It came upon us just as we
                  reached the Creek, and we tied up the cattle and mules, who like ourselves, had to
                  go supperless to sleep, after a tedious day of unremitting toil.</p>
               <p>"July 16th. Eleven miles brought us to Smith's Fork of Bear River, where we have
                  halted to rest a few days, as grass is good, and our poor, patient animals are
                  much in need of rest. There are plenty of Indians around us. They are very
                  troublesome, for, unless closely watched, they will steal whatever they can lay
                  their hands upon. There are mountains all around us. Bunches of willows so
                  completely matted<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6333-00000068"/> together that nothing
                  can get through them, are growing close to the camp. There are more than fifty
                  vehicles in sight of our camp, they having halted to give the exhausted cattle and
                  horses a good feed in this charming oasis. Our miniature city has been thrown into
                  excitement by a trial for murder in a neighboring camp, and our Captain and
                  Maurice were among the jurymen.</p>
               <p>"Daniel Olmstead was owner of a team and wagon. Five men were travelling with him
                  as boarders; they having agreed, when the bargain was made, to help about the
                  cooking and other necessary camp duty. The men had boasted among fellow
                  travellers, that they had their 'boss under the thumb, and intended to keep him
                  there.'</p>
               <p>"Olmstead went out with his cattle in the morning, telling Sherman Dunmore to
                  kindle a fire and put on the teakettle, so they could have some breakfast. When he
                  returned, his boarders had finished their repast, and he asked where his breakfast
                  was, and was told to cook his own fodder. Much abusive language followed upon both
                  sides. Olmstead prepared his breakfast himself; Dunmore threatening in the most
                  abusive manner to Lynch him.</p>
               <p>"'If you undertake it, you will not live long to brag of it,' Olmstead replied. He
                  then went into the tent and began to eat, using for the purpose, small carving
                  knife. Dunmore followed, jumped upon him and beat him severely. Olmstead called
                  upon the bystanders to take him off, saying that he had a knife. No one interfered
                  and he stabbed him in the lower part of the chest. He fell, and in twenty minutes
                  was a corpse. The jury, after an impartial investigation of the tragical affray,
                  brought in the following verdict:</p>
               <p>"'The wound inflicted by the knife of Olmstead caused the death of Dunmore, but
                  the same was inflicted by the aforesaid Olmstead, in self-defence.'</p>
               <p>"Olmstead addressed the jury after his aquittal, in an impressive if not eloquent
                  speech. His pale countenance, steady eye, and calm deportment, won the confidence
                  of strangers, and restored order among his men, who found that they had not
                  rightly reckoned the firmness of their host, when they meditated mutiny.</p>
               <p>"July 18th. To-day we met an Indian funeral procession. The dead body was wrapped
                  in a blanket, securely fastened with ropes of deer skin. The body was thrown
                  across the shoulders of a pony, and an Indian was riding behind it, to hold it in
                  its place. As they passed us, they pointed to the dead, and began a solemn,
                  heart-thrilling wail. It is said that they suspend their dead from the tree-tops
                  in the Bear River er Mountians. The squaw of the deceased, in practical expression
                  of her grief, had inflicted severe wounds upon her face, from which the blood was
                  trickling, and dropping in large beads upon her tattered garment.</p>
               <p>"July 19th. We travelled all day in the Bear River Valley. The valley is covered
                  with grass, and the mountain tops are clothed with splendid groves of fir, making
                  the ever varying scenery delightful.</p>
               <p>"When the earth shall have become one great settled garden of civilization, how
                  great will be the attraction of Bear River Mountain and valley scenery, to those
                  who delight in the picturesque and sublime.</p>
               <p>"July 20th. We reached Bear River to-day. A small, clear stream, whose waters
                  overflow the banks in winter and early spring, causing vegetation to grow
                  luxuriantly,</p>
               <p>"July 21st. The first view we obtained of Soda Springs, was two large mounds of
                  soda stone, form the summits of which the water was bubbling up. The water runs
                  down the sides of these mounds, evaporating slowly but steadily, and every day
                  increasing the size of the great ramparts which enclose them. The most palatable
                  soda was obtained from a walled spring on the margin of a stream of pure water.
                  Tartaric acid and sugar added to the soda water, makes a drink equal to the
                  'prepared soda' of the States. When we get a railroad through here, Soda Springs
                  will be far ahead of Saratoga or Newport, as resorts for wealthy invalids.</p>
               <p>"A little farther west, we found two other springs walled in the same manner as
                  the first, but with very small openings at the tops. The water of these is of a
                  reddish hue, but tastes much the same as that of the others. We visited another
                  mound, where the water boils up from the very highest peak and what does not
                  evaporate in the sultry, scorching, summer sunshine, runs down the side of the
                  mound, forming a rippling streamlet. There are many other diminutive springs in
                  less conspicuous places, upon this dome-shaped rock. The water of some is red,
                  while that of others, a few fact from them, is black as tar.</p>
               <p>"The Steamboat Spring is another wonderful curiosity of nature. The water puffs at
                  intervals from reservoir in the rock, with a sound like that emitted from
                  steamboat pipes. The '<hi rend="i"/>escape pipe,' is about three feet from the
                  spring. Mrs. Mays, who thinks it is <emph>wicked</emph> to account for this
                  phenomenon by philosophical rules, is sorely puzzled. She cannot see how the
                  Creator, who has done all things well, has permitted scientific men to understand
                  his rules. She says 'it's the work of the devil and nothing else.'</p>
               <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6333-00000069"/>
               <p>"The wild scenery around us would impress anybody but an emigrant with awe. We are
                  used to 'sight seeing and the earnest, matter-of-fact business of going ahead, is
                  the most important thing to us.</p>
               <p>"Soda Pool boils up in a large reservoir, where most of the water stands till it
                  evaporates. Some distance from the pool is a hollow crater whose fires have been
                  extinguished perhaps for ages; but the blackened rocks which cover the ground,
                  plainly show that this has once been the scene of violent volcanic eruptions.</p>
               <p>"July 22d. the scenery of Bear River Valley every day becomes more beautiful. The
                  weather pleasant and roads excellent, with the exception of a few mud holes that
                  are very difficult to get through. Our cattle drank of the poisonous alkali water
                  of one of these marshes. A mountaineer recommended a dose of vinegar. We gave each
                  ox a pint of Mrs. Gray's best, and nose of them died, though they are very weak
                  from the effects of the poison.</p>
               <p>"We encamped in a grassy vale near the river. The water of the river is palatable
                  but rather warm. We obtained a find supper of mountain trout by a half hour's
                  steady fishing.</p>
               <p>"July 23d. We travelled four miles through the valley, when the road struck the
                  mountains. They are not formidable as those we journeyed over some days ago. The
                  mountains are barren, producing nothing but stinted sage, aspens and weeds. Snow
                  is visible upon the heights, a few miles from the road. Encamped near a large and
                  beautiful spring, which breaks out at the foot of a mountain by the roadside. The
                  spring forms a lovely stream, large and rapid enough to propel a great amount of
                  machinery; but whose uninterrupted waters dash grandly on, losing themselves at
                  last in the broad channel of Snake or Lewis River. We obtained a splendid view of
                  the Three Tetons northeast of us, whose snow-crowned heads arose in majesty above
                  the lesser heights, and in the south, the Three Buttes, vied with their neighbor
                  Tetons in striking grandeur.</p>
               <p>"July 25th. To-day, we reached For Hall. Its walls are composed of sun-learnt
                  brick 'adobes.' It is a shabby concern, but in case of an attack from without, the
                  inmates would be tolerably well protected. In the bastions of the outside walls,
                  are port holes, through which to fire at an enemy. This Fort is now in the
                  possession of traders. who sell flour for thirty dollars per hundred weight. This
                  price makes us thankful that we are not in need of this necessary article of
                  food.</p>
               <p>"After we left the Fort, we obtained the first view of Snake River. We in the
                  evening crossed the stream whose source is the spring where we encamped on the
                  23d. It had received numerous tributaries, and where we crossed it was over fifty
                  feet wide and four feet deep.</p>
               <p>"Musquitoes are so annoying that we can scarcely exist except in dense smokes of
                  sage brush.</p>
               <p>"July 26th. About nine miles travel brought us to the Portneth; a clear, swiftly
                  running stream, about one hundred yards wide and five feet deep. We raised the
                  wagon beds about ten inches and forded it without accident. Maurice hired an
                  emigrant to drive Mrs. Welden's mules through the river, but he was so awkward
                  that she took the line when they had proceeded but a few paces. The fellow got a
                  joking about his verdancy that he'll be apt to remember for awhile.</p>
               <p>"The road, after leaving the Portneth, in addition to the deep sand and annoying
                  dust, is hilly and rocky in the extreme. A man died of mountain fever, in a train
                  neat our camp, this evening. They buried him in less than an hour after his death.
                  There are five persons sick of the same disease in the train. The weather is
                  excessively hot.</p>
               <p>"July 30th. We, to-day, passed American Falls of Snake River Tradition says that
                  years ago, a party of three Americans were swimming in the river, and not being
                  aware of their proximity to the Falls, swam on until they were overpowered by the
                  current and precipitated over the foaming cataract.</p>
               <p>"July 31st. We travelled until after dark to get to water, and when we had unyoked
                  the cattle, we found that we had encamped between two dead oxen whose putrid
                  carcasses drove away from us, the last vestige of appetite. A bystander who had no
                  olfactories, would have considered us grumbling set.</p>
               <p>"August 2d. The roads this afternoon were very rough and rocky. Sam Green broke
                  his wagon tongue, and we stopped earlier than usual to repair it. Our cattle are
                  failing fast and we are gratified this evening with the sight of excellent
                  grass.</p>
               <p>"I am now seated near the river-bank upon a ledge of rocks that form a natural
                  sofa. The river here runs through a rocky <foreign xml:lang="SPA">canon.</foreign>
                  The current is remarkably swift. The water rushes angrily over the bold-browed
                  crags, and leaps fearfully from rock to chasm, with a roaring sound. The scenery
                  is of the wildest possible description. Huge masses of basaltic rock arise in bold
                  array around me, with cedars nodding at many of their tops, where one would think
                  vegetation could not possibly exist. In the northeast is a seemingly endless sage
                  plans, and the view from every other point of the compass, is broken by craggy<pb
                     n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6333-00000070"/> gy bluffs and rocky mountains. I took
                  with admiration upon this wild array of massive rocks and desert wastes; but when
                  I reflect that far, far away, is the last resting place of my mother, and still
                  farther away is the home of my childhood; a feeling of indescribable sadness
                  arises in my breast.</p>
               <p>"Night had closed his sable curtains and we were about to retire to rest. When who
                  should come to our Captain Bald Hill Smith. His story is a sad one. So many
                  members of his family and company have died, that half of the wagons have been
                  abandoned. His wife and two eldest children died a few days ago, leaving him with
                  a dependent family of seven little ones. Who are unable to wait upon each other.
                  Many of his oxen have died; his provisions are getting short, and take it all
                  together, his is the most pitiable story that I have heard. Poor Andy Billens died
                  cursing his company for not saving his life. Captain Gray's sympathetic heart was
                  moved by his lamentable story, and he gave him a supply of bacon and tobacco,
                  which Maurice says, 'we are perfectly willing to spare.'</p>
               <p>"August 4th. This morning our cattle and Captain Smith's were driven to the river
                  drink. One of them plunged into the stream and swam across, the others soon
                  followed, and the current was so swift that we could not surround them. Cattle are
                  averse to swimming facing the sun, but the sun this time was behind them, and they
                  reached the opposite side of the river in an incredibly short time.</p>
               <p>Sam Green and Captain Smith went back eight miles up the river, to a wide, placid
                  place in the stream, where they intended to swim across with mules. Captain Gray
                  and John McDonald tried to swim across the river at the <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >canon.</foreign> The Captain is an expert swimmer, and gained the opposite
                  bank with ease, but McDonald, when fairly out in the current, became alarmed and
                  tried to turn back, The poor fellow was carried over the rocks by the rushing
                  waters and drowned! It was impossible to render him the least assistance, as he
                  was hurried among the rocks, almost before we were aware of his danger. Poor
                  fellow! He was much beloved by us all. Captain Smith will miss him sadly. He has
                  gone to render up his final account to the Great Judge of quick and dead. When the
                  deep gives up the dead that are therein, he will arise from the long sleep of
                  death, let us hope, to go to a better world. How forcibly comes my mother's
                  favorite text to mind just now, 'Be ye also ready, for in such an hour as ye think
                  not'—O, my Father, <emph>help</emph> us to be <emph>ready!</emph> His untimely
                  death has cast a gloom over every countenance</p>
               <p>"Captain Gray could not compel the cattle to re-swim the river facing the blinding
                  sun rays. Sam Green and Captain Smith tried to swim across upon the mules, but
                  they were too weak to stem the current, and poor Jed's 'Muley' was drowned, and
                  came floating down the river past the camp, long before his rider returned.</p>
               <p>"We hired women from another train to go across, for the sum of thirty dollars.
                  They wore life-preservers, and went over with ease; but they, with the help of
                  Captain Gray, were not to try it again. Other men were hired to swimming water.
                  They must have been frightened when they swam across, for they appear determined
                  not to try it again. Other men were hired to swim over, to whom we gave sixty-five
                  dollars out of the common purse, for the service. Their united efforts were not
                  sufficient to compel the cattle to swim. The captain had been all this time upon
                  the other side without clothing. The severe heat of the sun had blistered his
                  body, and as he could endure it no longer, he swam the river, donned his clothes
                  and returned to camp.</p>
               <p>"August 5th, This morning the Captain, who is wiser than most folks in knowing
                  just how to grasp the right horn of a dilemma, went to work and with the hel of
                  'all hands, 'corked a wagon bed, lashed tightly corked water casks to the sides
                  and ends, constructed oars and rudder, went above to where the stream was calm,
                  and took over two boat loads of men and boys in short order. The cattle were
                  overpowered by numbers, compelled to swim the river, and at midnight were all
                  driven to camp and tied to wagon wheels.</p>
               <p>"August 6th. Five of the cattle were dead this morning. My team is now reduced to
                  two yokes of oxen and the cow, which is compelled to perform duty one-third of the
                  time.</p>
               <p>August 25th. The wearisome duties devolving upon me are so fatiguing, that
                  sometimes neglect my journal and leave it unthought of for days. This time weeks
                  have passed since I last took notes of travel.</p>
               <p>"We are now opposite Fort Beise. It is fashioned something like Fort Hall, but is
                  not so durably constructed. It was built by the Hudson's Bay Company, and was
                  intended ore for a trading post, than a Fort, That company have now abandoned it,
                  but it is in possession of other traders. We drove our cattle on an island above
                  the Fort, where grass is plenty. While there we remarked a very disagreeable odor,
                  arising from a thicket near the water's edge. We searched the thicket and found a
                  half dozen dead Indians, Maurice examined the bodies, and pronounced them poisoned
                     by<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6333-00000071"/> strychnine. He inquired about the
                  matter at the Fort, and was informed that some emigrants had poisoned some dead
                  oxen in order to prove a disputed point about whether or not the Indians would
                     <emph>eat</emph> cattle left dead by travellers! The result proved the
                  experimenter's argument for nearly twenty Indians were poisoned.</p>
               <p>"August 31st. Five miles travel from our last encampment, brought us to a rocky
                  canyon on 'Snake,' which is the last place we shall see the river. Three mile
                  further brought us to Burnt River, a beautiful stream about twenty feet wide, and
                  two feet deep. The mountains are covered with dry bunch grass, which the cattle
                  cat greedily.</p>
               <p>"Effie and myself have been thrown into a state of indescribable anguish, on
                  account of the sudden illness of Willie. Effie says that he said before we left
                  the States that mother and him would soon go to Heaven, where pa is. I feel as
                  though it is superstitious to dwell upon his childish words, yet, I am very
                  anxious. Maurice says that his disease is cholera infantum.</p>
               <p>"September 1st. In spite of sickness we are compelled to move on. Dear little
                  Willie has been unconscious for hours.</p>
               <p>"September 2d. Two months and ten days this morning since our beloved mother was
                  taken from us, and the insatiate monster Death. not yet content, has again entered
                  our fold and borne away the treasure of our hearts! Last night our darling Willie
                  was called from earth to vie with angels around the throne of God. He was buried
                  to-day upon a mountain side, one hundred feet above the level of the plain, where
                  his peaceful remains will sleep in undisturbed repose, until the trump of God
                  shall awake the sleeping millions of our little world. A beautiful cedar waves its
                  wide-spread branches over his tomb, and here, beneath its shade, I have wandered
                  to be alone with Willie and his God.</p>
               <p>"Our treasure has been removed to the skies, to a higher sphere, a more perfect
                  existence, and we must not murmur at our loss when he has ganed so much. The bud
                  has been nipped; its beauties hidden from our sight, but in a more genial soil, it
                  will bring forth a full grown flower of surpassing loveliness. He possessed a
                  precocious intellect, and in our haste to expand it into fuller bloom, we had
                  forgotten that the promising bud could die! Effie watched alone with him last
                  night for an hour. This morning she gave me a piece of poetry, saying that she had
                  written it during her midnight vigil. I will insert it here, so that we may have
                  it for reference in after years:<q>

               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">ADA'S DREAM.</head>
               <p>MANSFIELD had proceded steadily on with but few delays from accident or sickness;
                  every day widening the distance between him and Captain Gray's Company. On the
                  evening of the third of September, he encamped on an elevated tableland, in a
                  dense pine forest of the Blue Mountains. Mountain fever had usurped the cholera
                  and was laying many low, though the disease was not so generally fatal as the
                  early pestilence had been.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mansfield had been for several days complaining of giddiness and slight
                  fever, but the symptoms, she thought, were not alarming. After Ada had completed
                  the necessary evening work, she strolled away into the dark, pine forest, took a
                  seat upon the smooth, round surface of a fallen trunk that time had long before
                  stripped of its bark, and looked toward the dark tree tops, with an expression of
                  chastened sadness.</p>
               <p>Shadows darkened in the mountain gorges; the wind moaned dismally through the
                  swaying pines, and a solitary raven croaked forth its ominous notes from a bough
                  directly over her head. The distant reverberations of loud calls to cattle, and
                  the echoes of cracking whiplashes, added wildness to the romantic spot.</p>
               <p>"What do I dread?"</p>
               <p>A deep sigh from the hidden caverns of her spirit, arose upon the air; and she
                  thought that when it reached the tree tops, they caught up the sound, passed the
                  watchword to the neighboring pines, and with one accord they joined in chanting
                  the lamentations to which she had become accustomed.—Still she sat and mused, and
                  still the tall old pines kept up their ceaseless sighing, sighing. She leaned
                  against a standing tree that served as a back to the seat she had chosen.</p>
               <p>"I am weary; heart sick. Jesus, protect the loved and absent!"</p>
               <p>She sleeps. Her dormant inward nature, that saw so little light during the dark,
                  day cloud of suffering, hidden an guish of spirit, such as the <emph>tried
                     only</emph> can imagine, is now unveiled, and what does she see?</p>
               <p>Day after day, the dark pine forest, seems to afford rest for her wearied body.
                  Ghostly, phantom forms flit by, whispering unearthly bickerings into her sinking
                  soul. Death, on his pale horse, is riding past her, slaying to the right and left,
                  with an awful scourge.</p>
               <p>He comes close to her; breathes a foul breath of sickening odor into her very
                  nostrils. A fierce battle ensues. She is almost overpowered by a grim, arch-fiend,
                  who is about to strike a killing blow. She gasps, she pants, she struggles.</p>
               <p>"Hark!"</p>
               <p>Upon the moaning air, while the grim monster is yet striving at his deadly work, a
                  welcome sound is coming. And the swaying pines join in a song of rejoicing.</p>
               <p>"What do I see?"</p>
               <p>The roaring winds strike a different key. Wild exclamations of delight, meetings,
                  embraces, tears. Silence reigns a moment and the grand old trees break forth in
                  chanting a mournful requieum.</p>
               <p>An angel form bends over her.</p>
               <p>"Sleep, maiden, sleep! For the time is coming when thy powers of body and spirit
                  will be overtaxed in ways thou dost not now imagine!"</p>
               <p>"Look!"</p>
               <p>A form,—does she not recognize, in the raven locks and shining, death-beaded brow,
                  the form of a beloved mother prostrated upon a bed of suffering!</p>
               <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6333-00000073"/>
               <p>"Duty calls thee!"</p>
               <p>She tries to rise. Powers invisible restrain her and she is kept crouching before
                  the phantom, whose hisses madden her.</p>
               <p>Again, she hears a sound of rejoicing. A still, calm peace within her soul, which
                  for months she has not known or felt, overpowers her.</p>
               <p>She smiles. Baffled phantoms vanish and a strong arm and steady hand support her
                  exhausted frame.</p>
               <p>"Miss Mansfield! Ada! Sure, yet father's nearly scared to death about ye, an' yer
                  mother's well nigh dead! Wake up? Let's go to camp, if ye want to see yer Ma
                  again."</p>
               <p>"O, Pat! I have had such an awful dream!"</p>
               <p>"No wonder, when yer head was twisted half off yer body and yer arms throwed back,
                  as if ye meant this sleep to be yer last."</p>
               <p>"Did you say Ma was sick?"</p>
               <p>"Sick ain't the word ma'am. Yer Ma's well nigh dead for the fright o' ye."</p>
               <p>"Let's go to camp Pat; I did'nt intend to stay so long."</p>
               <p>"It's past midnight an' we've been a huntin' ye an' shoutin' an' holerin' enough
                  to wake the dead; an' here ye've been a snorin' an' dreamin' yerself into a fit a'
                  delirium an' the Virgin knows what all. "<emph>Whoop!</emph> WHOOP! HURRAH!"</p>
               <p>"Why Pat! are you crazy?"</p>
               <p>"Divil the bit o' crazy am I. Sure an' we was to give this signal if ye were
                  found; and I've done me best."</p>
               <p>A cheerful shout was heard in answer to O'Donaldson's wild whoop, as he guided Ada
                  through the darkness to the camp.</p>
               <p>"O, Ma!"</p>
               <p>The thought of her dreadful dream, like an awful forboding of coming sorrow,
                  darted through her soul. Mrs. Mansfield had joined for hours in the frantic
                  search. When she saw that Ada was safe, the reaction of hidden disease overcame
                  her, and she sank powerless to the ground.</p>
               <p>Four days passed away and Mrs. Mansfield had given no sign of returning reason. At
                  intervals, she would break forth in incoherent sentences, and what Ada could glean
                  from these outbursts of her mother's hidden being, would agitate her severely.</p>
               <p>Her mother, since the separation of themselves from their company, had not been
                  happy. She felt that she had wronged her daughter, and conscience had given her no
                  peace.</p>
               <p>The fifth morning of her serious illness had dawned. Her husband and daughter were
                  kneeling beside the rudely made couch which Pat's ingenuity had devised for the
                  benefit of the sufferer. She opened her eyes and cast a steady, rational glance at
                  her daughter.</p>
               <p>"Ada!"</p>
               <p>"Do you know me, Ma?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, dear."</p>
               <p>"Are you suffering much?"</p>
               <p>"'My soul is indeed sorrowful, even unto death;' but I suffer no bodily pain. Do
                  you know what my trouble is and has been?"</p>
               <p>Ada could not reply. She had gathered enough from her mother's incoherent ravings
                  to know what was the trouble, but when she would have spoken, her tongue refused
                  to articulate.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mansfield gave one hand to her daughter. Her husband grasped the other and
                  pressed it to his lips, while the scalding tears fell upon the attenuated
                  hand.</p>
               <p>"Ada can you forgive me for the suffering I have caused you to bear? If you knew
                  the interest and sorrow with which I have marked your saddened countenance, you
                  surely would be willing to pardon my unkind disregard of your affections. Bring me
                  your Journal, dear. Here darling, I<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6333-00000074"/>
                  read the secret emotions of your wrestling spirit—in these pages, which you
                  thought were for no eye but yours. I would have talked with you about it last
                  evening, but you were gone, I knew not where."</p>
               <p>"Not last evening, Jane. You have lain here almost a week."</p>
               <p>"Have I?"</p>
               <p>Her voice was failing, but she nerved herself to unburden her troubled mind.</p>
               <p>"Time is short with me. Promise me, Henry, that if Ada and Maurice live to meet
                  again, you will not oppose their union when I am gone."</p>
               <p>"Certainly, dear, I'll promise, if you desire it, but oh, I cannot give you
                  up."</p>
               <p>"But you and I would have separated those whose bosom fires burn hotter than ours
                  ever have, because they have been forbidden to blaze. Oh! Henry, let us make
                  restitution and I will die in peace."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Captain Gray's Company!</emph>" Pat shouted, at the top of his voice.</p>
               <p>Ada turned pale and trembled. Her father started and a look expressive of baffled
                  ambition which he could not suppress, crossed his features for a moment.</p>
               <p>"Go Henry; meet Maurice and ask him to come here, for I must see him."</p>
               <p>Maurice was already at the door of the tent.</p>
               <p>"Ada!"</p>
               <p>"Maurice?"</p>
               <p>Regardless of what opposing parents would do or say, he rushed forward and clasped
                  her in his arms.</p>
               <p>"God is merciful! Is the dead alive? I thought I saw your name at the head of a
                  grave, six weeks ago."</p>
               <p>"Indeed?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; Ada M. was the name, and I did not think it possible that it could be any
                  one else."</p>
               <p>"I am yet alive, as you see, but oh! Maurice, to think we should meet like this!"
                  she replied, as she pointed to her mother, who was too deeply moved to speak. Self
                  was instantly forgotten, in her earnest desire to know if her mother could
                  recover.</p>
               <p>The invalid raised her eyes and gave him her hand. "Will I get well, Maurice?"</p>
               <p>Fever had well nigh dried the life blood from her body and was sending what
                  remained, at a fearful rate, through the burning arteries. He hesitated.</p>
               <p>"Don't be afraid to speak your mind. If I am past recovery, I, of all others,
                  ought to know the truth."</p>
               <p>"To be candid with you then, I think it is impossible for you to recover."</p>
               <p>She looked lovingly at the youthful pair, who were bending over her with such deep
                  concern, took Ada's hand, placed it in Maurice's and said, "May you be happy."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Welden desired admission. Her pale, subdued expression, struck the dying
                  woman with remorse. She knew that they had done wrong in leaving her when death
                  had left her house-shrine so desolate; and the resigned, though sorrowful features
                  of the bereaved widow smote her with anguish.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Welden, will you forgive us for leaving you? We were influenced by none but
                  selfish motives and don't deserve it, but I cannot die in peace without your
                  pardon."</p>
               <p>"I have nothing to forgive, Mrs. Mansfield; don't let such fancies trouble you. It
                  was your privilege to go ahead and I never blamed you for doing what you
                  considered best."</p>
               <p>When the last doubt was cleared away, the excitement which had nerved her, relaxed
                  and she sunk back upon the couch in a deep, tranquil sleep.</p>
               <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6333-00000075"/>
               <p>Mrs. Gray, Mrs. Green, Mrs. Sam Green and Effie, next came to her side, but the
                  sleeper was unconscious of their visit. Effie and Mrs. Welden embraced Ada and
                  mingled their tears with hers. Her joy was mixed with a cup of bitterness. She was
                  excited with different and conflicting emotions, and longed to be alone.</p>
               <p>She had not cared to visit the scene of her strange dream, since that memorable
                  night, but now a strange feeling impelled her to seek that spot again.</p>
               <p>The winds were sighing, in the same melancholy strains through the rustling pine
                  boughs, when she again sat down upon the fallen tree. Flashes of alternate heat
                  and cold burned and chilled her agitated frame. The loud beating of her heart as
                  it fluttered wildly against its prison walls, kept time to the rushing tumult of
                  her conflicting thoughts.</p>
               <p>She heard the fall of footsteps. Instinct told her who it was that sought her.</p>
               <p>"O, Maurice! To think that the joy of our meeting must be damped by this great
                  sorrow, is too much!"</p>
               <p>A strong arm, upon which she had a right to lean, encircled her waist and a
                  passionate kiss—the first the lovers had indulged—sent the thrilling life blood
                  faster to the maiden's heart. He spoke of hope, of happiness beyond the grave, of
                  meetings above, and their own happiness in each other.—She lay in his arms,
                  silently, as if a delicious trance filled her soul. Her father came towards them
                  and, as he looked upon the trusting, blushing face of his daughter, who realized a
                  joy, he had in years of business and activity almost forgotten, his heart smote
                  him with the remembrance of the trouble he must have caused her, when no other
                  motive than "false pride," could possibly be given as an excuse for the course he
                  had pursued.</p>
               <p>Another thought troubled him. No medical aid could be procured for his wife when
                  she was first attacked and he could not banish the idea that if Maurice had been
                  there in time, he might have saved her life.</p>
               <p>He advanced to where Maurice and Ada were sitting and took his daughter's
                  hand.</p>
               <p>"Will you forgive us, Pa?"</p>
               <p>He kissed her in reply and without uttering one word that he meant to have said,
                  he left the lovers alone.</p>
               <p>"We had better return to camp, Maurice. Poor Ma! If she could live, my cup of
                  happiness would now be full."</p>
               <p>The invalid slept for many hours and awoke the next morning with some appearance
                  of convalesance. But alas! it was but the last flashes of her earthly existence;
                  the ray that a flickering blaze will emit just before it expires.</p>
               <p>"O Ma, you look so much better this morning."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mansfield attempted to speak but her tongue was paralyzed. She beckoned to
                  Maurice who approached the couch with an inquiring look.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mansfield, Ada and Maurice all paid earnest attention to her attempts to
                  speak.</p>
               <p>She took Ada's hand, placed it in Maurice's as she had done the morning before and
                  made them understand that she wished to see them married.</p>
               <p>Ada trembled with sorrow and agitation and made no reply. She turned deadly pale
                  and would have fallen, had not Maurice caught her in his arms. "There is a clergy
                  man in a train just passing and we can get him to perform the ceremony, if you
                  desire it," said her father, who was anxious to do whatever his wife
                  requested.</p>
               <p>The train was stopped and the Rev. Mr. Marshall soon approached the dying, who
                  looked at him and pointed upwards. Her request was made known to the minister, and
                  without further time for thought or preparation, he bade them kneel and exchange
                  the marriage vows. Beads of death<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6333-00000076"/> dew
                  glistened upon the mother's brow and the face assumed the ghastly look of
                  death.</p>
               <p>"Must my bridal day be one of mourning?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mansfield pressed her daughter's hand, smilled—a peaceful smile of Love and
                  Hope, looked at her husband and again the thin hand was raised toward Heaven.</p>
               <p>"Would you like to have a funeral sermon?" Maurice asked, as he looked from the
                  minister's benevolent face into the eyes of his weeping bride. "Perhaps," he
                  continued, "your Ma would like to give us a text of her own choice, as a
                  foundation for a sermon."</p>
               <p>"'Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord,' is one of her favorite funeral
                  texts for suitable occasions. Ma is this text your choice.?"</p>
               <p>Her mother smiled approvingly and closed her eyes. So peaceful was the transition
                  from a mortal state to immortality, that for some moments, none but Maurice knew
                  that the spirit had departed.</p>
               <p>The funeral was attended by all the emigrants who had been passing, and a solemn
                  and instructive discourse was listened to with marked decorum; a matter worth
                  mentioning, when we consider that half of the congregation at least, openly
                  denounced the reality of the Christian religion. Mr. Marshall, who had no time to
                  lose, as his family provisions were getting low, hurried on, after service and was
                  not seen by the company again.</p>
               <p>Captain Gray gave the mourners all the assistance in his power, though he
                  confessed to his wife that if it had not been for Ada, Mansfield might have
                  finished his journey alone.</p>
               <p>"I think it ain't right to leave 'em, now they're in trouble; besides, Miss Welden
                  'll have to leave if Maurice does," said Mrs. Gray.</p>
               <p>"Well, Mansfield's l'arnt somethin'—that's a fact, If he'll act right hereafter, I
                  guess I won't say nothin' against him goin' with us."</p>
               <p>For two days, Ada's life was despaired of by her anxious friends and loving
                  husband. The anguish mixed with her sudden cup of joy, shook her healthy
                  constitution and well nigh destroyed her life. She kept up until her mother was
                  buried; and then, the tumultuous feelings about the great attachment of her inner
                  being had subsided, excitement gave way, and she was left powerless.</p>
               <p>Maurice knew that rest of mind was what she most needed. She would not consent for
                  them to be idle on her account and the morning after her mother's decease, they
                  prepared to journey on. The dull stupor which had benumbed her faculties, did not
                  deprive her of reason, but she lay in a kind of dreamy consciousness, unwilling to
                  be disturbed.</p>
               <p>Maurice, in travelling hours, was compelled to remain at his post as ox driver,
                  while Ada remained in the carriage with her father. The seats had been taken from
                  the vehicle, and the Barouche form of the carriage bed, had been made level by an
                  array of pillows, over which a mattrass was laid. No haughty queen, in a gilded
                  chamber, surrounded by hangings of crimson and gold, with Maids of Honor attendant
                  upon her most trivial wants, ever enjoyed more hallowed peace, or better
                  opportunity for delicious repose, than did this young wayfarer, as she dreamed the
                  flitting hours away.</p>
               <p>The third morning after her marriage had dawned. The rough and perilous mountain
                  gorges and more level tablelands had been safely passed, and the company had
                  halted upon the banks of the Umatilla River, for camping time had once more rolled
                  around.</p>
               <p>Maurice, with the true devotion of a loving Benedict, was untiring in his efforts
                  to make her comfortable. As soon as he had attended to the pressing business of
                  the evening, he<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6333-00000077"/> went to the carriage
                  where "lay in state," as Effie said, the bride of a few days.</p>
               <p>"You feel better this evening, dear?'</p>
               <p>"Yes, Maurice. I believe I shall be able to cook Pa's breakfast for him in the
                  morning."</p>
               <p>"Don't be uneasy about our Pa. He's Mrs. Welden's boarder, and I assure you he
                  fares well. You shall keep free from care of any kind, until the roses bloom again
                  upon your cheeks. My wife has got to have a chance to be a healthy woman. 'An
                  ounce of preventive is worth a pound of cure.' When you are able to work you'll
                  have enough to do, without undermining your constitution by toiling when you can
                  hardly stand alone. You may take exercise anywhere but over the fire. I protest
                  against your attempting to bend over the smoking ovens and boiling teakettles
                  until you can run two hundred yards with case. Let every women live up to that
                  rule, and we'll see more rosy faces."</p>
               <p>"I will feel as well in a few days as Mrs. Welden does, and she never thinks of
                  rest."</p>
               <p>"No; <emph>she</emph> doesn't but <emph>I</emph> do. She has enough of fatigue and
                  anxiety through the day without having to worry herself to death at camping hours,
                  to fix up eatables for men folks. I do the laborious part of the work and let her
                  do the polishing."</p>
               <p>"I begin to think I'll live easily, when <emph>I</emph> get to housekeeping. I am
                  certain I shall, if you live up to such principles as these."</p>
               <p>She was sitting up in the carriage, supported by his arm. A smile, half roguish,
                  half loving, such as Maurice thought could only emenate from her lips and eyes,
                  rippled her pale features; and a blush, as he answered her look with an ardent
                  kiss, made her look spiritually beautiful. <q>

               <p>"I DECLARE," said Mrs. Gray, "if Ady did'nt git a man to take care o' her, then
                  I'm no judge o' such things! If Sam was half as careful o' my Polly, I'd think we
                  was in a streak o' luck when she got him. Though he's good as most of the men, if
                  he does expect her to carry the water and dig a place to fix the fire, while he's
                  a loungin' under the wagon, a smokin his pipe. Joseph Gray ain't no better. It's a
                  blessed fine thing that we're able to stand it, that's some consolation."</p>
               <p>"It always looks to me like imposin' on a man, for a woman to put as much on 'em
                  as you like to have 'em do," said Mrs. Green. "I've seen more 'n one man, that the
                  minute he come in, would have to hold the children, or bring in water, or may be
                  go an' milk the cows. I wonder how any man of common sense can stand it. Daddy
                  would'nt."</p>
               <p>"If Polly 'll have to learn such lessons as that, I hope she won't have to live
                  close to you when we git settled. It does very well for girls to do milkin' an'
                  carry water an' chop wood an' sich like, bekase it makes 'em hearty like. But when
                  a woman has a family of children, an' always a baby to fret her life out, a man
                  o'rt to be ashamed to let her do hard work. The way a feller begins is the way
                  he'll be mighty apt to hold out."</p>
               <p>"My boys was raised to see women work, an' they'll have to do it, if they live
                  with 'em."</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> know one, that I won't let work so hard much longer, if she is
                  y'er son's wife."</p>
               <p>"She's got her head in the noose an' she can't help herself," retorted Mrs. Green,
                  getting very much excited.</p>
               <p>"O, if yer goin' to git huffy, I'll hush, but I'll see after this, whose girl
                  Polly is," said Mrs. Gray.</p>
               <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6333-00000078"/>
               <p>"An' I'll see whose boy Sam is," was the reply.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gray would not agitate the matter, when she thought a quarrel was brewing,
                  and she went to her work, muttering to herself, "If there ever was a curse, a
                  mother-in-law, over a girl that won't take her own part, is one, I know. If Sam
                  was <emph>mine</emph> an' Polly <emph>her'n,</emph> there'd be different talk in
                  that woman's mouth."</p>
               <p>Morning came, and Mrs. Sam Green was a mother. A red, fat mass of "incipient
                  humanity," enclosed in red flannel wrappings, which the youthful father delighted
                  in calling "Pappy's Boy," seemed determined to attract notice by his annoying
                  cries.</p>
               <p>The young mother smiled and blushed, as Ada—who pronounced herself able to
                  walk,—came to her wagon, praised the baby, and desired the privilege of giving the
                  "emigrant" a name.</p>
               <p>"Sam says we'll call him Toby, an' I guess it's settled," she replied.</p>
               <p>Everything passed off harmoniously, until Mrs. Sam's convalescence, when as usual,
                  Sam took no further notice of camp work. He had applied himself with such laudable
                  zeal to the camp duties for a few days, that Mrs. Gray began to hope there would
                  be no need of her interference.</p>
               <p>Toby was a week old, and the active, healthy constitution of his youthful mother
                  had gained the ascendency over effects of recent suffering, so that she again
                  began to assume the task of preparing food, and performing the "thousand-and-one"
                  other camp duties, not the least of which was minding the baby, who though very
                  good when the "wagon was going," objected to necessary halts, and asserted his
                  right to notice by infantile vociferations that certainly reflected no discredit
                  upon the stentorian lungs of his Grandpa Gray.</p>
               <p>"Polly," said Mrs. Green, "ye've been able to walk a half mile to-day, an' I don't
                  see any use in havin' Sam to milk an' carry water anymore. He has to drive oxen
                  all day, an' he's had a pretty hard time of it for a week. I think it's nothin'
                  more'n right for him to rest a while."</p>
               <p>Polly did as her mother-in-law requested, though she said to herself, "If Sam
                  needs rest, I wonder what she thinks <emph>I</emph> need?"</p>
               <p>When the wagons halted, she took the "piggin,"—one her father had
                  manufactured—from its place in the wagon, and proceeded to milk the cow. She
                  thought Sam would have objected, but he said nothing. As it was not "his turn" to
                  go off with the cattle, he prepared a hook and line to go fishing, not heeding the
                  cries of the baby, who had been left alone in the wagon, where he was fighting the
                  air and squalling ferociously. Mrs. Gray was angry. She was one of those persons
                  who are hard to arouse, but when once started she would carry her point or
                  die.</p>
               <p>"Sam Green! when I give ye my girl, I didn't think ye'd let her work when she
                  wan't able! Now, do ye jist put up that fish hook, an' go an' git wood an' water
                  for yer wife an' let her take the baby. If ye don't take care o' her ye shan't git
                  to keep her, if she is your wife!"</p>
               <p>Sam was astonished. He had not meant to be unkind but was thoughtless. When Polly
                  went to milking, he took it for granted, that his chores about camp were at an
                  end. Poor fellow! He had little idea of the trouble in store for those who set out
                  to rear a family of fac-similes of themselves.</p>
               <p>He did not reply, but took the water pail and started off. Polly had almost given
                  out in her exertions over the milk pail—or piggin—and was glad to get into the
                  wagon, when she soon succeeded in hushing the baby's cries. She certainly looked
                  as if a prolonged rest was necessary to completely restore her strength.</p>
               <p>Catching cold was Mrs. Green's only dread, and Polly had not been permitted to
                  doff her nightcap, for fear of such a<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6333-00000079"/>
                  calamity. The color had all departed from her round face and the yellow hair
                  escaped from the ample cap and hung in uncouth braids about her shoulders. The
                  dark and numerous freckles, somewhat bleached by the week's lying in the shade
                  were still remarkably prominent about the nose and forehead; dark spots in the
                  white ground-work of her inexpressive features.</p>
               <p>"I never was used to seein' women waited on after the first week," said Mrs.
                  Green. Woman's industry was her hobby, and she was highly displeased at Mrs.
                  Gray's interference—in Polly's behalf. "She's not over industrious no'way, an' her
                  mammy's advice won't help the matter much."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gray took no notice of her dissatisfaction. It was enough for her to know
                  that her daughter could get rest when it was needed, and Sam, like a dutiful son,
                  done his best to oblige his mother-in-law.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Green contented herself with side thrusts at Polly, who was so sensitive
                  that, rather than have received the censure of her mother-in-law, she would have
                  worked like a galley slave. But Mrs. Gray laid down rules and stood ready to
                  defend her when it was necessary.</p>
               <p>"I tell ye, Polly, if ye give up to that woman, ye'll live like a slave a few
                  years and then die an' leave a raft o' children. Ye ain't stout no way, like Mammy
                  Green an' its no use a talkin', ye can't stand it." The mother-in-law, who were
                  such firm friends in their life as neighbors, could not agree as relatives and
                  each learned to almost despise the other.</p>
               <p>Maurice and Ada watched the conflict with curiosity.</p>
               <p>"Aren't you glad," said Herbert "that you are away from kin folks, so that you can
                  do as you please? Here's two women almost ready to pull hair about their son and
                  daughter, who if left to themselves would do well enough. When I marry, I am going
                  to eschew such a nuisance as a mother-in-law. Mrs. Stanton, you have chosen a mate
                  without that troublesome accompaniament. When I marry I am going to follow your
                  example."</p>
               <p>"You talk as if you mean to marry before many days.—One would think the stakes
                  were set, and you all ready for the fatal step," laughed Maurice.</p>
               <p>"No, I'm not that far gone; but I saw a pair of black eyes, some raven curls and a
                  bewitching mouth, the other day that set me to thinking. I will soon be sixteen
                  years old, and you told me yourself, that you thought more about marrying at that
                  age than you ever have since that time."</p>
               <p>"But I would'nt have owned it, then."</p>
               <p>"And I <emph>will</emph> you see; that makes the difference. 'Open confession is
                  good for the soul.'"</p>
               <p>"Where is your brunette beauty?"</p>
               <p>"In Captain Willard's Company."</p>
               <p>"Her name?"</p>
               <p>"You're very inquisitive, but as I began it, I guess I'll tell you. Florence
                  Willard has caged my heart. Whether I have caged hers or not, is, as yet a matter
                  of speculation. I did'nt speak to her; that is, not exactly; but I
                     <emph>saw</emph> her! My stars! if she is'nt beautiful! Why, if I had tried to
                  speak, I would have choked. I don't know but Ada would be half as handsome, if she
                  only had the curls."</p>
               <p>"I prophesy that when you are twenty-one, you'll go into raphsodies about somebody
                  with eyes almost white and hair like Flaxy's mane," said Ada, laughing gaily at
                  his boyish carnestness.</p>
               <p>Flaxy was an Indian pony which her father had purchased and given her, as a bridal
                  present. His name designated his color.</p>
               <p>"I won't dispute it, because <emph>you</emph> said so. All that I have to say is,
                     <emph>you'll see!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Florence Willard was indeed, all that Herbert described. The Willard train had
                  halted but a short distance from Captain<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6333-00000080"
                  /> tain Gray's Company, and Effie and Ada decided upon a call at their camp.</p>
               <p>The young lady in question, was an orphan girl, about Effie's age. She had been
                  adopted by a bachelor uncle, who was taking her with him to a new country.</p>
               <p>The call was an interesting one and Ada afterwards expressed to Maurice as her
                  opinion, that "though Herbert and Florence had both better be thinking of books
                  than Cupid, I don't believe either of them will ever find so congenial a companion
                  in any one else."</p>
               <p>Florence Willard was seen daily for a week, and then left behind, and years had
                  passed before Herbert again met or heard of his lost ideal.</p>
               <p>Daddy Green's great desire in all his dealings with his fellow man, was
                     <emph>peace.</emph> Many times had his good nature been imposed upon; many a
                  dollar had he lost rather than dispute with a neighbor; and many times had he
                  suffered injustice upon himself and family, by his determination to give offence
                  to no one. His wife had little sympathy with him in his notions and one great
                  worry of her nervous existence was that Sam, her eldest boy, in whom she had
                  prided more than all the other members of her family, was what she called "as poor
                  a stick as his daddy."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gray had no trouble with Sam after the "ice was once broken" about his duties
                  as a husband and father, but the hostility between the two mothers became so
                  marked that Daddy Green resolved to settle it.</p>
               <p>"Don't ye think neighbor," he said to Captain Gray, "that it would be better for
                  all of us, if the women would let Sam and Polly alone? Polly ought to know her own
                  strength and business best, an' I don't see why our women should fret about it as
                  they do."</p>
               <p>"Let 'em <emph>fight it out,</emph> Daddy. I'd give a long bit, myself, to see 'em
                  pull hair," replied the Captain with a grin.</p>
               <p>"It worries me to see 'em quarrelin'. If it goes on this way, the young folks 'll
                  git mad an' go off,—I'm sure I would'nt blame 'em for it—an' we'd never see 'em
                  again.—I've talked to Sam about it an' he says if Miss Gray won't meddle any more
                  he'll do his best to make Polly comfortable. I don't b'lieve you'd like to see 'em
                  go clear away from us, any better 'an I would. I thought I'd speak to ye in time,
                  for I do hate to have a fuss. There's no understandin' young people. They might be
                  jist ready to tear each other's eyes out, an' let you or me step up to part 'em
                  an' they'll both turn an' give us <hi rend="i"/>blixen for our pains. I say, let
                  young folks alone."</p>
               <p>The captain related the conversation to his wife, who exclaimed, "Well, if ther'd
                  a been no medlin' in the first place, I'd a never said a word! But what does Miss
                  Green do, but jest as Polly gits able to go alone, she must tell her that Sam's
                  waited on her long enough, an' she must go to work like a nigger. I'll see Miss
                  Green an' make a bargain with her. If she don't walk the chalk, <emph>I'll find it
                     out!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gray embraced the earliest opportunity to set matters to rights, and Mrs.
                  Green, who was tired of a business in which she did not well succeed, agreed to
                  meddle no more with her daughter-in-law's affairs. The contention was thus
                  settled, as Captain Gray said, "without the least show for a petticoat fight."</p>
               <p>We are getting ahead of our story, and must now leave the private affairs of the
                  company and copy some further extracts of Herbert's Journal, which should perhaps
                  have been given in a previous chapter.</p>

               <p>"SEPTEMBER 5th. We reached Powder River this afternoon. This is a lovely fordable
                  stream, about thirty feet wide at this season of the year. The valley has a
                  fertile appearance and looks as if it might be well adapted to raising wheat.</p>
               <p>"September 6th. Our road in the afternoon was over the first ranges of the Blue
                  Mountains. It was near dark when we reached the brow of a mountain, overlooking
                  Grand Ronde Valley. Here was a view of unsurpassed beauty. Before and above us, in
                  the blue-tinged distance, lay the principal ranges of the Blue Mountains, and
                  below, a valley of ten square miles in extent, green with summer grass and
                  foliage, and looking to us, who, wearied with constant toil, and chastened by the
                  rod of affliction, gazed upon this charming oasis, like a realization of
                  Paradise.</p>
               <p>"The descent from the mountain-top into the valley, is the most dangerous piece of
                  road that we have yet encountered. There was a gentle breeze which blew the dust
                  in clouds into our faces, darkening the roads and hiding the teams and wagons from
                  our sight, sometimes for moments together. At such times we would have to stop and
                  wait for a contrary breath of wind to waft the light dust away. Mrs. Welden
                  displayed the most heroic fortitude during this hour of trail. Added to our other
                  difficulties, night was coming on, so there was no time to be lost. We furnished
                  Mrs. Welden with some log-chains, with which we rought-locked her carriage wheels,
                  and giving up her children to the care of Effie and Mrs. Sam Green who could walk
                  with them away from the road, she seated herself firmly in the carriage, which had
                  been stationed behind the Captain's wagon, and drove down the mountain side
                  without accident. The Captain says that 'there ain't another woman on top o' dirt,
                  as could do it!'</p>
               <p>"Grand Ronde River runs through the western part of the valley. It is like the
                  other rivers of this region, small, clear, rapid and cold. Its banks are adorned
                  with trees of birch, willow, bitter cottonwood, wild cherry, and alder in the
                  valley; and pine, fir, cedar, birch and larch, where it rushes through the
                  mountains.</p>
               <p>"The Indians of the valley—the Cayuses—are very wealthy. They possess numerous
                  herds of horses and cattle, and have many of the luxuries uries of life in
                  abundance. The squaws are many of them good-looking, and if they were properly
                  educated and dressed, their beauty would be a passport to the best American
                  society.</p>
               <p>"Some white traders here, offer flour for sale at forty dollars per cwt. Hundreds
                  of emigrants are destitute, and many have parted with their last dollar for flour
                  to keep themselves and families from starvation.</p>
               <p>"September 7th. We left the Grand Ronde and travelled about eleven miles over the
                  mountains. The delightful and inspiriting scenery, makes us almost forget the
                  fatigue of the journey, but our teams are failing very fast. Effie says she don't
                  see how we are to cross the Cascade Mountains, but I tell her that I guess we'd
                  better not climb a mountain before we get to it. 'Sufficient for the day is the
                  evil thereof.'</p>
               <p>"We intended to remain at the Grand Ronde River in the mountains, where the above
                  entry was made, but when we had rested an hour, we moved on three miles further,
                  having journeyed through heavy timber almost all day. I omitted to mention the
                  descent of a mountain to the river, which was worse, if possible, than that of the
                  mountain leading into the Grand Ronde from the east. This is our first encampment
                  in a forest since we left 'Hundred and Two,' east of St. Josephs.</p>
               <p>"'Darkie,' my favorite wheel ox is dead. He held back so hard in descending a
                  mountain slope that he severed an important artery. He held back until the wagon
                  was out of danger, and then staggered and fell dead in the road, looking at me
                  with a speaking stare as he breathed his last. Mr. Thurston once said that, "If
                  there is an animal below man who has a soul, it certainly is the ox.' No wonder
                  that he said so, if an ox ever looked at him as 'Darkie' did at me.</p>
               <p>"September 7th. We had moved on about a mile this morning, when whom should we see
                  but our travelling companion, Mr. Mansfield. Sickness has visited his family, and
                  Mrs. Mansfield cannot live but a short time. Poor Mr. Mansfield! He looks ten
                  years older than he did when I last saw him but little more than two months ago.
                  Though we cannot believe that he does not deserve trouble, yet we can't turn away
                  from him and Ada when they are in such deep distress of mind.</p>
               <p>"Effie and I think a marriage is brewing.</p>
               <p>"September 8th. This morning Maurice and Ada were married in compliance with her
                  mother's dying request. We heard a solemn funeral discourse this afternoon, and
                  to-morrow we will move on.</p>
               <p>"Ada looks like a shadow. I am afraid she will have a hard attack of sickness.</p>
               <p>"September 9th. We journeyed all day in the mountains. At noon<pb n="162-163"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000082"/> we halted in an opening in the timber in a range of
                  mountains heading to the north. We encamped at night in heavy timber where water
                  is good but grass is poor. My sadly weakened team has been reinforced by a yoke of
                  cattle from Mr. Baker's team. O'Donaldson deserves credit for his manner of taking
                  care of those oxen. But one of them have died.</p>
               <p>September 10th. We travelled ten miles through timber, and five miles over the
                  last descent of the Blue Mountains, when we struck the Umatilla Valley. Before we
                  descended the last mountains, we obtained a glorious view of the Cascade range.
                  Mt. Hood reared his snow-capped summit, in surpassing grandeur, high above the
                  other mountains, appearing as a stationary white cloud set in a casing of amber
                  and gold. The valley below presented an appearance not unlike the view of the
                  Grand Ronde from the eastern mountains, only upon a much more extensive scale. As
                  far as the eye could penetrate in the north and south, was seen a rolling prairie
                  covered with waving grass. No timber was visible, except that growing along the
                  banks of the Umatilla River. We found this river quite low, being about fifteen
                  feet wide and not over six inches deep. Its banks are adorned by bitter
                  cottonwood, choke-cherry, birch and thorn-apple trees. Pheasants are as numerous
                  in this valley as prairie chickens are in the prairies of Illinois. The Indians
                  here are stupid and filthy. They have made some attempts to cultivate the soil,
                  but are too indolent to effect much by their effeminate exertions.</p>
               <p>"We travelled near the river for about five miles, when the road turned to the
                  left over a rolling, grassy, dusty plain. Six miles further brought us again to
                  the Umatilla, where we crossed it twice, to avoid difficult angles in the road.
                  Had a dish of pheasants for supper. Encamped near the river.</p>
               <p>"September 11th. This morning the road again left the river, and we turned to the
                  right over a sandy plain. We ascended a long ridge and again came in sight of Mt.
                  Hood, while off to the north-east, we viewed Mt. St. Helens. We travelled over
                  this plain for seventeen miles without water, when we again struck the river
                  Umatilla and encamped. Dry bunch grass was plenty and good.</p>
               <p>September 12th. Four miles brought us to the Indian Agency now unoccupied, except
                  by traders from the Willamette Valley. Here is a new looking frame house, the
                  sight of which reminded us of 'home and civilization; we left the Umatilla for the
                  last time at this place and journeyed on, over a sandy plain for a distance of ten
                  miles, when we came to Alder Creek and encamped.</p>
               <p>"September 13th. The roads are hilly but solid. We begin to halfway realize our
                  journey ended. Many are out of provisions. There is flour and beef for sale at
                  different trading posts, but the prices demanded are so exorbitant, that it is
                  almost impossible for poor folks to purchase food.</p>
               <p>"September 18th. Four miles' travel brought us to Deshutes or Falls River, which
                  is perhaps one hundred and fifty yards wide at the mouth, where the ford is
                  situated, a short distance below a handsome cascade. This stream courses on its
                  rapid way, through mountain defiles and rocky cannons, forming numerous cataracts,
                  until it reaches the Columbia River, into which it empties. We got an Indian to
                  pilot the wagons across, and another one to take the females over in a canoe, for
                  which service they taxed us five dollars. After crossing we ascended a long, steep
                  and rocky hill, from whose summit we again viewed the Columbia River, adorned upon
                  either side with majestic bluffs of basaltic rock. We this afternoon viewed Mt.
                  Jefferson, Mts. Hood and St. Helens were also in plain view at the same time.</p>
               <p>After crossing Five Mile Creek, we directed our course over a rolling plain and
                  camped at night near a sulphur spring, having travelled to-day about ten
                  miles.</p>
               <p>"September 19th. Travelled eighteen miles and encamped near Five Mile Creek, which
                  we crossed yesterday afternoon, and left we thought forever. Sister and I have
                  sent our wagon to the Dalles of the Columbia, to be forwarded to Oregon City by
                  water. I will take the charge of Mrs. Welden's ox-team, in crossing the Cascade
                  Mountains, so that Maurice can drive her mules.</p>
               <p>"September 22d. We are encamped near Barlow's Gate. Clouds are gathering thick and
                  fast in the mountains, and a strong south wind warns us of an approaching storm.
                  We are afraid to venture into the mountains unless the sky is clear.</p>
               <p>"September 23d. This morning our apprehensions of a mountain storm could no longer
                  be a matter of conjecture. At nine, A. M., the rain commenced falling slowly, and
                  continued to descend at intervals until noon. Our shelter at the foot of the
                  mountains kept us from the fury of the storm; which was very severe upon the
                  exposed heights. After noon the clouds passed away and a steady but gentle north
                  wind caused us to feel once more at case. I strolled out in the afternoon to the
                  open ground not far from camp, and watched the fleecy clouds play<pb n="164-165"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000083"/> ing around and receding from Mt. Hood. A fresh fall
                  of snow upon its broad and lofty summit, had given it the appearance of dazzling
                  whiteness which contrasted strangely with the dark green, gloomy, heavy timbered
                  heights beneath it. While I gazed, the sun suddenly poured a golden flood upon its
                  crested top, and reflected amber gleams from the mountain's hoary head, upon the
                  grassy plain below, with dazzling effulgence.</p>
               <p>"September 24th. This morning we took up the line of march and began our journey
                  through the Cascade range. Ten miles from Barlow's Gate brought us to the Little
                  Deshuies, a very cold, rapid, turbid stream, about thirty feet wide and eighteen
                  inches deep. The mountain passes are darkened by heavy timber. Among the
                  varieties, are pine, cedar, poplar, fir, scrubby white-oak and bitter cotton
                  wood.</p>
               <p>"September 25th. We travelled about fifteen miles over an extremely rough and
                  difficult road, which has been made through very heavy timber, and is only wide
                  enough in most places for us to clear the wagon axles by careful driving. We
                  encamped below the Summit Hill, near a mars by prairie of several miles in extent,
                  covered with a kind of coarse swamp grass. The day has been very cold. My oxen are
                  all dead. Bad luck seems to pursue us, but it is a long lane which has no turn.
                  Mt. Hood is in plain view, some five or six miles north-cast of our camp. A small
                  stream of seemingly more than icy coldness, rushes from the mountain's side and
                  tumbles through a defile near us. Nothing but its rapid fall prevents it from
                  freezing. The cutting wind blows steadily from the snow crowned summit of the
                  exposed mountain, and when compelled to face the north-eastern, we cover our noses
                  in voluntarily.</p>
               <p>"September 26th. Those of us who in Platte River valley said so much about the
                  road being 'better than was represented,' gave up our favorite theory when we had
                  descended Laurel Hill. 'The half has not been told,; burst involuntarily from the
                  lips of more than one of us. Our last provisions were consumed this morning, and
                  after a most fatiguing day's travel, we are compelled to go supperless to rest.
                  Instead of repining, we have much amusement about our Laurel Hill supper.'
                  Protracted travelling has hardened our frames until our powers of endurance are
                  astonishing.</p>
               <p>"September 27th. We broke a king-bolt and wagon tongue to-day, Mrs. Welden's mules
                  both died this afternoon, we suppose from having eaten some poisonous herbs. Only
                  two yoke of her cattle are living. We were compelled to leave her wagon, which is
                  not so valuable as the carriage, and what we most highly prize of her effects and
                  my mother's have been placed in the wagons of our obliging friends, whose teams
                  are so reduced that they are poorly able to bear the additional burden. We have
                  been without a particle of food for two days, but contrary to our apprehensions,
                  we have suffered but little from hunger. The Baker children and Mrs. Welden's
                  little Lucy complained of hunger, but Effie and Mrs. Stanton found a friendly
                  patch of salal berries, and gathered enough to satisfy them. We have prepared Mrs.
                  Welden's carriage for working oxen, and her two yoke of cattle can draw it with
                  case.</p>
               <p>"September 28th. We paid twenty-eight dollars this morning for enough of sour,
                  musty flour for breakfast for all hands. I ate almost enough for two men before I
                  took time to notice the disagreeable flavor of Bald Hill Smith's
                     <emph>ox-feed.</emph> He had bought this damaged flour at the Dalles for his
                  oxen, but was moved by our money to give us a breakfast. We encamped at night upon
                  the <hi rend="i"/>Zigzag.</p>
               <p>"September 29th. Eighteen miles' travel brought us to Mr. Foster's residence, at
                  the western base of the Cascade Mountains. The sight of a white house, neat
                  garden, loaded fruit trees, and waving corn-stalks, animated us all. Captain Gray,
                  who had been told by a trader that corn could not be raised in Oregon, gave three
                  hearty cheers, suggestive of future 'corn dodgers,' which he says are the makin'
                  of <emph>everybody.</emph>' Dozens of wagons, hundreds of immigrants, and herds of
                  poor cattle and horses are around us. Almost six months ago we started upon our
                  journey, and now that the goal is reached, how we look! 'Dirty, sallow and ragged;
                  our poor beasts are walking skeletons, our wagons and their covers travel-soiled;
                  our ranks sadly thinned, and many of our hopes laid low! But such is life. 'All
                  eternity is yet to be,' and we will look ahead.</p>
               <p>"September 30th. OREGON CITY, the imigrant's haven is before us, and what do we
                  see? I confess to being disappointed with its appearance. Instead of the green
                  valley, 'sloping gradually toward the river's edge' which we had imagined as the
                  city site, huge piles of basaltic rock,—reminding us of the views of Snake and
                  Columbia river bluffs,—among which the houses are scattered with but little regard
                  to taste or beauty; and at the base of these towering cliffs, a dense array of
                  dwellings, stores and shops, extending for a mile along the banks of the
                  Willamette river, meets our anxious and curions gaze; and this is OREGON CITY. But
                  this city will some day rival many more handsome locations, in wealth and
                  manufactories. The Willamette Falls, instead of<pb n="166-167"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000084"/> being allowed to tumble on in a roaring cataract,
                  will soon be employed by capitalists, as power to turn mighty machineries for the
                  benefit of this remote region.</p>
               <p>But here we are, Effie and I, without a dollar, dependant upon our own exertions
                  for a living; and my Journal will henceforth be laid aside, to review when times
                  are good and memory has failed to portray the realities of what is past."</p>

               <p>BROTHER, what <emph>must</emph> we do? Here we are alone and penniless. You can't
                  support me unless I do my part. I met a lady a few moments ago, who told me that
                  she would give me twenty-five dollars per months to wait upon her little boy."</p>
               <p>"Are you <emph>willing</emph> to go out to service, sister, mine?"</p>
               <p>"I am both willing and anxious to do anything for a livelihood that is
                     <emph>honest.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Herbert and Effie placed what few effects that remained of their outfit for the
                  journey, in the store of an accommodating merchant, who agreed to take care of
                  them until they could know where to remove them. They called to see the lady who
                  had offered to take Effie into her service, whose pleasant face won the regard of
                  the brother and sister, the moment they glanced into her deep blue eyes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Clinton was equally pleased with Effie, and the sum of twenty-five dollars,
                  to be paid on the last Saturday of every month, was to be her portion for the
                  winter. Her duties were constant but light, and Mrs. Clinton's little Jamie,
                  reminded her so forcibly of the lost and loved Willie, that he soon became as dear
                  to her as her own brother had been.</p>
               <p>The monotonous duties of her treadmill existence, so different from the free and
                  easy life of her earlier days, told upon her spirits, but her home for six months
                  at Mrs. Clinton's, was so near a paradise, contrasted with an after residence of
                  twelve months at another house, that she afterwards thought of her first term of
                  servitude, as a season of complete happiness.</p>
               <p>Herbert procured work during the winter, at the house of a farmer near the City,
                  at reasonable wages. The wagon they had sent to the Dalles was never afterwards
                  heard of. What they could earn was their only show for an education and
                  support.</p>
               <p>Of all the members of Captain Gray's Company, Mrs. Welden was the most severely
                  tried. Two yoke of lean, worn-out cattle, and a carriage, much the worse for wear,
                  were her only remaining worldly possessions. These she sold for three hundred
                  dollars. She rented a small house and purchased necessary fuel, house-keeping
                  utensils and provisions for the winter, which, where everything commands such an
                  enormous price, exhausted her little stock of money. No chance was before her but
                  to work, and the choice of occupation lay between washing and sewing. She decided
                  to sew, though washing would have been the most profitable business, her Southern
                  blood revolted at the idea of engaging in such drudgery. By plying the needle
                  early and late, she was enabled to keep even with the world, but could not by
                  strict economy and vigilent exertion, lay up even a trifling sum. Had her husband
                  lived, they would have been entitled to six hundred and forty acres of land, by
                  complying with the requirements of the Donation Law; but, as he was gone, half
                  allowance was now her portion, and to obtain this, she must "reside upon and
                  cultivate for four consecutive years," a thing to her inexperienced mind,
                  impracticable.</p>
               <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6333-00000085"/>
               <p>The winter had been mild, with the slight exception of a few freezing days, and
                  February, the Oregonians holiday season, was ushered in on a bright balmy morning,
                  when Summer birds chanted their sweet carols from the boughs of a denuded locust
                  tree that swayed to and for in the morning breeze, near the widow's only
                  window.</p>
               <p>"Why should mankind alone be miserable, in this beauteous world," she sighed, as
                  she looked upon the merry songsters. Her temporary residence overlooked the
                  Willamette Falls. She looked long and steadily at the foaming, glee-some cataract,
                  and fancy wandered away to the many scenes of the kind she had wearily passed,
                  since her husband had been consigned to the grave. Long years of toil and
                  privation; weary scenes of suffering, both of mind and body, lay before her
                  imagination, pictured vividly in the distance. Despair tugged at her
                  heart-strings, and she felt like giving up the weary struggle, between poverty and
                  suffering, when a "still, small voice," whose echo long afterwards, sounded
                  through her soul, whispered, "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden,
                  and I will give you rest." She knelt, and an eloquent appeal to the Most High,
                  ascended upon the listening air.</p>
               <p>As though an angel of mercy were sent to minister to her drooping spirit, letters,
                  the first she had received for months, were handed to her by a lady for whom she
                  had been sewing for weary days and weeks. She eagerly broke the seals, and Maurice
                  Stanton's name appeared at the bottom of the fourth page of each epistle. One had
                  been written some two months before the other, but by some mismanagement had not
                  been received before.</p>
               <p>It contained a melancholy account of the death of Mr. Mansfield, who had felled a
                  forest tree upon himself, where he had been making rails in the timber.</p>
               <p>For an hour after she had perused the first, she held the second letter in her
                  hand, dreading to open it, lest further gloomy tidings should meet her senses. At
                  length she broke the seal and read the contents through mists of fast falling
                  tears. Part of the letter, for the edification of the reader, we will
                  transcribe:</p>
               <p>"We are living in what my father would consider a real backwoods style, though Ada
                  says she is perfectly contended. We have a hewed log cabin, containing two rooms
                  besides a kitchen. The house is rudely constructed, but '<emph>love,</emph>' you
                  know, levels many aspirations. I wrote you two months ago, concerning the
                  melancholy death of my lamented father-in-law.</p>
               <p>"We had built our cabin and fenced a garden over a section line, so that each
                  could reside upon and cultivate, without being deprived of Ada's society. Her
                  father had filed his notification of a residence upon a half section of land,
                  which Ada holds as his only heir.</p>
               <p>"Now for our proposal. Ada says that if you could come with your family and reside
                  with us, and be content with our fare,—which at present is of the plainest
                  description,—she will deed to your children, the three hundred and twenty acres of
                  land her father left.</p>
               <p>"Now, my dear friend, you will offend us, if you refuse. She says, and I'm of her
                  opinion, that its a crying shame for us to be isolated upon a claim of nine
                  hundred and sixty acres, when you, who are alone in the world, with a helpless
                  family of little ones, cannot, unless aided by friends who are willing to
                  circumvent the law, hold even what would, in your own right have been yours, had
                  your husband lived to hold his portion.</p>
               <p>"There is more than one horn to a dilemma, and we are fortunately, at liberty to
                  take hold of the one which is the most easily managed.</p>
               <p>I have not yet 'proved up' mine and Ada's claim. Consequently, if you will come,
                  we can move the cabin to our middle line. You can then 'prove up' and hold in your
                  own right, three hundred and twenty acres of what we new claim and we can 'spread
                  our wings' over another half section, joining the one we shall reserve for
                  ourselves.</p>
               <p>"We can easily do this, provided no other claimant secures<pb n="170-171"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000086"/> the land before we hear from you. I confess that we
                  have no need of so much land, but if Uncle Sam is generous enough to give it, we
                  have as good a right as any one to accept the present.</p>
               <p>"You ought to see how easily Ada takes to farm life. She is often sad when
                  reflecting about the loss of her parents, but her naturally buoyant spirit does
                  not remain long at a time under desponding clouds.</p>
               <p>"Our location is beautiful and when our 'four years are out," we hope to build
                  upon an eminence, overlooking the river, where gentle sea breezes can be enjoyed
                  and where nature has been particularly lavish in her display of the sublime and
                  beautiful.</p>
               <p>"I have been thinking of going to the mines, but Ada says, and perhaps she is
                  right, that economy and industry at home are so much more reliable as paymasters,
                  than labor and vicissitude in the mines, that I have hearkened, like a model
                  husband, to her far-sighted judgment and for four years at least I am to be a
                  farmer.</p>
               <p>"The Baker children have gone home to their relatives in Wisconsin, in the care of
                  an uncle, who fortunately for the children, called at our house as a wayfarer and
                  recognized the orphans. He has amassed a fortune in the California mines, and is
                  going home to get married. They are to return by the Panama route. Their
                  leave-taking was very affecting. Ada begged hard to keep Eda, but to no
                  purpose.</p>
               <p>"She sends you much love, and repeats her earnest request that you will comply
                  with her offer. She will write you soon. Don't delay to answer, for we are
                  awaiting your decision about making our proofs of settlement."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Welden read and re-read the letter, as if she could scarcely believe her
                  senses. She had trusted in the Almighty Ruler for protection, but with so little
                  faith that she was ashamed of her pretensions. She had never dreamed of so kind an
                  offer as this, and as soon as she could still her agitated frame, she wrote the
                  following reply:</p>

                           <p>"I must acknowledge, my dear disinterested friends, that your liberal
                              offer has been most opportunely given. When your letter came to hand a
                              few hours ago, I was ready to sink under the oppressive weight of
                              poverty, toil and suffering, to which I have been so long subjected. I
                              am at loss for words with which to thank you for your kindness. My
                              only fear is, and will be, that in living with you, I shall prove a
                              burden to those who show themselves so willing to befriend me. I have
                              nothing upon which to lean for a support. If I could sell my portion
                              of land, perhaps I could get something to work <emph>with,</emph> but
                              the Surveyor General has said that I cannot give a deed to land until
                              the title is perfected; and as four years must pass before I can
                              really posses a claim, I cannot hope for assistance soon in that
                              quarter. The way looks dark, but the Lord will not forsake me. He has
                              raised up kind friends to help me now, and will not desert me in a
                              great need.</p>
                           <p>"I have been hiring myself out to do fine sewing, and have strained my
                              eyes until a hazy glimmer surrounds an object the moment I look
                              steadily upon it.</p>
                           <p>"Herbert and Effie Goodwin have both secured good places for the
                              present. Effie comes to see me occasionally, and her presence always
                              enlivens me like a sunbeam. I did not hear until this morning about
                              your father's death. This is a world of disappointment, trouble and
                              sorrow. But we have an assurance that he is now united with those who
                              went before, and though he cannot come to us, we can go to him. To say
                              to you that I feel a delicacy in receiving, as a present for my
                              children, the inheritance which your father left, would be saying no
                              more than you who know my natural disposition, are ready to believe.
                              You have offered aid in this my last extremity, and I will waive all
                              scruples of pride and come to you within a fortnight. Till then,

               <head type="sub">THE BACK-WOODS FARMERS.</head>
               <p>FARMER GRAY, as we must again call him, had many debates with his wife, Sam and
                  Polly, about where they should locate.</p>
               <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6333-00000087"/>
               <p>He did not want to settle in the timber, but Mrs. Gray, who regretfully remembered
                  her Illinois home, had a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">penchant</foreign> for the forest
                  and finally prevailed upon him to build a cabin beneath the shade of a dozen
                  black, gigantic fir trees. In an early day, the Indians and squatters, for the
                  sake for giving grass a chance to grow, annually fired the underbrush and fern.
                  The fir trees received their share of the general conflagration, but were seldom
                  killed by the fire, though the charred, dead lower limbs will bear evidence for
                  many years of the burnings the trunks have survived.</p>
               <p>Farmer Gray settled in a neighborhood of back-woodsmen, who had emigrated, many of
                  them from western Missouri. The habits of his associates were much to his taste,
                  and when we have described his farm and house, we will have given a faithful
                  delineation of the most common features of his neighbors' homes. A log cabin,
                  which could only boast one room, a large, dried mortar fire-place, heavy batten
                  doors and open windows, with blankets for shutters, afforded his and Sam Green's
                  family a refuge for the first winter. When summer came, they were too busy to fix
                  up the hut, and besides Farmer Gray concluded that a "tight house was unhealthy,"
                  so that several years passed before he was ready to build a new house or even
                  repair the old one. He managed to "get in" with four yoke of oxen, and with these
                  he succeeded well in breaking prairie.</p>
               <p>Sam traded off his wagon for cows, and for the sake of economy, he lived with his
                  father-in-law. The cabin was built near the center of the claim upon two section
                  lines, so that two square miles could be held by one house and two families.</p>
               <p>Maurice Stanton, who would permit no one to prefix the Dr. to his name after he
                  left the Plains, suddenly appeared at Farmer Gray's door, one afternoon in the
                  February holidays. He lived about thirty miles from his old captain, and this was
                  the first time he had seen him since they had parted at Oregon city. Farmer Gray
                  was delighted with the visit, and quite "tired out" his visitor with a tiresome
                  walk to his various corner stakes.</p>
               <p>"Farmer Gray, when land comes into market, and there are immigrants to purchase
                  it, then you and I can sell enough to make farms for several families and have
                  plenty left for our own use."</p>
               <p>"No sir-ee! I'd rather buy than sell. I've crossed the Plains a purpose to git
                  elbow room, an' I've got it an' intend to keep it."</p>
               <p>Maurice smiled. "I am not willing to give up society for the sake of land. One
                  hundred and sixty acres of good soil is enough for <emph>anybody.</emph> If Uncle
                  Sam had given us no more than that, we would all be better off in five years in
                  the way of schools, society and improvement, than we will be as matters stand,
                  twenty years hence."</p>
               <p>"But we wouldn't be so well off for stock range."</p>
               <p>"'Stock range' is very convenient in its place, but society is better in my
                  estimation."</p>
               <p>"I earnt a section o' land a crossin' the Plains an' I'm going' to hold on to it
                     <emph>shore.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"So did Mrs. Welden and other widow ladies whom I could name. Yet they cannot hold
                  but half that amount for themselves and children, because their husbands are gone.
                  And to 'reside upon and cultivate' as the law requires, is calling for an
                  impossibility from a lone woman who has nothing but her feeble exertions to depend
                  upon for a support."</p>
               <p>"A woman haint no business <emph>with</emph> land, nohow."</p>
               <p>"Women have, or ought to have, as good a right a <emph>live</emph> as men. If a
                  section of land is no more than enough for you and I, how much has a widow earned,
                  who has lost her husband on the Plains, and journeyed on alone to this 'land of
                  promise,' without a single relative to look to for support or<pb n="174-175"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000088"/> protection?"</p>
               <p>"What could a woman <emph>do</emph> with land, if she had it, I'd like to
                  know?"</p>
               <p>"Land will some day be valuable in this prosperous country, and a few years'
                  residence in a town where she could get the means of support by industry, would be
                  rewarded by a few thousand dollars as the price of her claim, to which a widow has
                  a good a right as you or I have to our possessions."</p>
               <p>"Durn the women! They'll marry d'rectly an' won't have no business with two
                  farms."</p>
               <p>"In case they should marry in time to hold land as wives to other husbands, then
                  they ought properly to be deprived of the first husband's share of Uncle Sam's
                  bounty. But the way matters stand, they are compelled to marry or starve."</p>
               <p>"I never thought much about the Land Law afore, respectin' widders, but here's
                  Bald Hill Smith. He lives about six miles from here, an' makes a mighty poor mouth
                  about me an' my old woman holdin' a square mile, when he can't git but half that
                  for him an' seven children, bekase his wife's dead. But I s'pose our palaverin'
                  over it won't mend the matter, an' we'd as well dry up. What's Miss Welden a
                  doin'?"</p>
               <p>"She is now in Oregon City, but I have offered her a home at my house, and expect
                  her to come up on the Valley Bird. We are going to try your plan of living upon
                  section lines, in order to hold land for the her until her "time is ouit'"</p>
               <p>"I hearn the other day that Miss Graves, that lost her man on the road, aint
                  goint' to live long. She moved on a claim not long ago to hold land for her baby.
                  She's got the consumption an' aint able to work much, but she's got a little money
                  that she thinks she can stretch along while she lives, an' maybe she can give the
                  child away."</p>
               <p>"She may be suffering," said Maurice, his sympathy aroused at the mention of
                  distress; it is the duty of the neighbors to help provide for her wants."</p>
               <p>"I told Sally this mornin' that we ought to rig up the oxen an go to see her. We
                  hain't much to spare yit, bekase times is mighty hard with us, but we won't lose
                  nothin' by befriendin' the needy."</p>
               <p>Maurice was welcomed by Polly and her mother with genuine hospitality, and when,
                  after breakfast the next morning after his arrival, he prepared to depart, they
                  were much disappointed because he could not remain another day.</p>
               <p>"You don't get the miners' mania, do you, Farmer Gray? I see that the people
                  around you do not seem easily allured by golden visions. Most immigrants who enter
                  the valley empty handed, make a speedy rush for the mines."</p>
               <p>"No; me nor my neighbors don't leave, an' for that very reason ye'll see us
                  swimmin' when yer hasty folks are flounderin' in the mud. Folks had a heap better
                     <emph>stick to the knitten',</emph> if they intend to git rich. Now, ye'll see
                  before five years, if I don't have a big orchard, lots o' plow land, good
                  buildin's an' comfortable livin', when ten to one of the gold hunters, 'll have
                  nothin' to live on but vexation."</p>
               <p>And so the sequel proved, although few at that time coincided with the views of
                  the foresighted backwoodsman.</p>
               <p>As Maurice returned homeward, he called upon Daddy Green, who lived about five
                  miles from Farmer Gray, and was farming much after his fashion.</p>
               <p>"D'ye think Polly's got so she does hardly any work now?" Mrs. Green asked.</p>
               <p>She could not banish the thought of 'old times,' and her woman's inquisitiveness
                  was as strong as her memory.</p>
               <p>Maurice smiled as he recalled old scenes.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, Mrs. Green, I always considered your daughter very industrious. Perhaps
                     <emph>I</emph> am not a competent judge, but<pb n="176-177"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000089"/> Mrs. Stanton says that she is too industrious for
                  her own good."</p>
               <p>"Well, one thing is certain, She'll never work like Sam's mammy does. Girls aint
                  no 'count no-way, like they once was."</p>
               <p>Maurice was not anxious to dispute the point, and excused himself from the old
                  lady's tiresome talk, by going to the woods, where Daddy Green, Jake and Billy
                  were making rails. From them he learned that the widow Graves was living about a
                  mile from their cabin, in a little house that they had helped to build. They also
                  prepared her fuel and other necessaries, going by turns to stay in her house at
                  night.</p>
               <p>Maurice was soon at the door of her humble abode. The invalid, whose every motion
                  bespoke the genuine lady, instantly recognized in her visitor, the young physician
                  who had been called to the bedside of her dying husband. A horde of sorrowful
                  memories blanched her cheek. His kind voice seemed to bring so vividly to her
                  imagination, the day when she had last seen the husband of her short period of
                  happy married life, that before she could articulate a sentence, she sobbed aloud
                  as she offered him her hand.</p>
               <p>"Does my coming distress you, Mrs. Graves?"</p>
               <p>"I'm pleased to see you, doctor, but you came in so unexpectedly that when I saw
                  your face, memory brought up so forcibly the sorrowful circumstances of our first,
                  and last meeting, that I was overcome."</p>
               <p>He assumed a cheerfulness he did not feel. The hectic flush, which plainly
                  revealed the condition of the poor consumptive, was remarked, and he saw at a
                  glance that the destroyer was at work. He thought it best to be cheerful and not
                  notice her appearance, and turned his conversation to inquiries respecting her
                  opinion about the country.</p>
               <p>"I am <emph>satisfied anywhere,</emph> and it matters not where my last few days
                  are spent. Life seems strong within me, but too many of my family have been
                  carried off by pulmonary diseases for me to be deceived. Warm weather will seal my
                  destiny. I would have remain in Portland, where I had rented a comfortable ready
                  furnished room, but was told that my boy could not hold land as my heir, unless I
                  should 'die upon a claim.' The poor child will be left without relatives or
                  property; but if he should live this land may be of service in enabling him to get
                  an education.</p>
               <p>"His father's dying request rings in my ears by night and day. If I could get some
                  one to take him after I am gone, who will be kind to him and educate him well, I
                  will not fear to die." Her face brightened, as she looked upward with a trusting
                  glance. "My husband, we will soon be reunited in a world of bliss."</p>
               <p>Farmer Gray's loud sonorous "Wo!" was heard as he stopped his wagon before the
                  door. He soon entered the cabin in company with his wife, who was carrying a
                  traveling bag well loaded with sundry articles of comfort, which she deposited
                  with a grunt of relief in the chimney corner.</p>
               <p>"The la me! If that child don't look jest like Jed did when he was a baby! I wish
                  you'd let me have him, Miss Graves. I'll treat him well, and love him jest as well
                  as I did my Jeddy," said the kind-hearted old lady, as she took up the smiling
                  innocent and kissed him affectionately, while sympathetic tear-drops glistened
                  upon her cheeks.</p>
               <p>"I'll tell ye what I'll do widder," said Farmer Gray, affecting a jovial manner,
                  while a suspicious moisture burnished his eyes; "I'll tell ye what I'll do. As
                  Sally seems to fancy the young 'un, an' we have no little chaps o' our own, if
                  ye've no objection, I'll take him an' keep him till he's fourteen. He can choose
                  his own guar<emph>deen</emph> at that age. We have coarse doin's an' homely fare
                  at my shanty, but we have warm hearts an' willin' hands. They're goin' to 'rect a
                  school house on my place, an' when he gits big<pb n="178-179"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000090"/> enough I'll send him to school. If I had my life to
                  live over again, I'd never raise another young 'un without givin' it good
                  larnin."</p>
               <p>The invalid assented to his proposal, and Maurice drew up a document of agreement,
                  which was signed by the interested parties; and Charlie Graves was given up to the
                  tender care of his new protectors.</p>
               <p>"See here, Joseph, it won't do to take the child away now, nor it won't do to
                  leave Miss Graves. Polly can do the work at home, an' I'd as well stay here for
                  awhile. You'd as well go home an git somethin' more for us to live on. If there's
                  anything can wake my feelins' its the sight of feller creature's in distress."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gray went out to the wagon, to give some private directions to her husband,
                  and Maurice bade the widow an affectionate good bye and joined the couple at the
                  wagon.</p>
               <p>"Here, Mrs. Gray, is a small sum of money for the benefit for the sufferer. I am
                  sorry that I have no more, but poverty at present is the common companion of us
                  all."</p>
               <p>"The la me! Five dollars 'll git her a <emph>heap</emph> o' little nations; I wish
                  ye had fifty thousan'. Nobody'd use it better an' you would. D'ye think she'll
                  stand it long?"</p>
               <p>"I think she will not."</p>
               <p>"Well, it seems mighty strange that folks dies off so. When I used to complain
                  about sickness, my old man would say that folks couldn't die in
                     <emph>Oregin,</emph> till they'd went sixty miles cast of the Cascades."</p>
               <p>"We contracted too much disease upon the Plains, madam, to think of being
                  perfectly healthy for a season. No one has become sick in the valley, who was well
                  when the journey was ended."</p>
               <p>"Folks may brag on <emph>Oregin</emph> as much as they please, but it'll be a long
                  time afore I'll think it's what it's been cracked up to be," was the impatient
                  rejoinder.</p>
               <p>"Good bye, Mrs. Gray. I have not time now for further conversation. You'll like
                  the country well enough when you have become acclimated."</p>
               <p>A month had passed and Mrs. Graves had solved the mysteries of the world immortal.
                  Her little boy was considered a treasure in the Gray family, who performed their
                  contract respecting him, to the letter. Mrs. Sam Green's little Toby who was a few
                  month's younger than the orphan baby, sometimes monopolized the attentions of the
                  grandparents, but as time rolled on, every year adding another to Polly's family
                  of obstreperous boys and girls, little Charlie, with his winning ways and peaceful
                  disposition, became a universal favorite. Farmer Gray often called him "quare,"
                  when noticing his thoughtful, abstracted manner, but the child never refused to do
                  his bidding, and consequently gave no ground for displeasure. He often remarked
                  that it was a lucky day that throwed that beam o' sunshine across his
                  door-step."</p>
               <p>His farm was made with a backwoodsman's peculiar exertion. Beauty was altogether
                  out of his line, but every thing substantial and old fashioned, in a few years
                  surrounded his dwelling. As their worldly possessions increased, Mrs. Gray became
                  delighted with the country. She grew eloquent over her Shanghai chickens, fat
                  turkeys and nois-some ducks; and when she obtained a pair of geese, her joy was
                  unbounded. "The grass," for cattle, sheep and horses, was one of her main themes
                  of conversation. The snowstorm of '52, in which some of their stock died of
                  starvation, rather cooled the old lady's ardor, but she was proof against a like
                  calamity, when that dreary time was past. The next harvest was a bounteous one,
                  and the oat-straw, which at her suggestion, was ever afterwards packed in log pens
                  to meet emergencies, afforded food for famishing herds during subsequent snow
                  storms.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">MRS. MUNSON.</head>
               <p>MRS. CLINTON was going East, to visit her relatives, and Effie was compelled to
                  seek another home. Servitude had been divested of most of its horrors during her
                  sojourn with her lovely friend, and when told that she must seek employment
                  elsewhere, it was with a heart as heavy, as when eighteen months before, she had
                  went to the abode of a neighbor, three thousand miles away, to seek admittance to
                  an humble outhouse, that she prepared herself to go forth in search of other
                  lodgings.</p>
               <p>Herbert had not visited her for a fortnight, and did not know that she was in need
                  of a situation.</p>
               <p>She had heard that a lady who lived three doors distant from Mrs. Clinton's wished
                  to employ her, and with a palpitating heart she ascended the steps leading to the
                  portico. A servant answered her timid ring, and she was shown into the parlor,
                  where a lady was reclining in an easy chair, surrounded by a sickening odor of
                  camphor and ammonia, who scanned her visitor as if she were a specimen of art
                  placed before her, expressly for inspection.</p>
               <p>"How old are you?"</p>
               <p>The tones were measured, cold, and haughty, repelling the little assurance that
                  Effie has mustered before addressing her.</p>
               <p>"I'll be fourteen next October, ma'am."</p>
               <p>"Ah, well, you're old enough to mind Allie, wash dishes, and keep the rooms in
                  order. No one who pretends to work for me, must think of being idle. You may come
                  to-morrow bat you must <emph>work,</emph> or I can't keep you."</p>
               <p>Effie soon made her exit from the house, glad to get away from the smell of
                  medicines, and from the haughty, over bearing air that surrounded her future
                  mistress.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Clinton was too busily engaged with the preliminaries for her departure, to
                  notice the dejection of her protege, who retired to her little chamber in utter
                  loneliness.</p>
               <p>She looked from the window upon the rushing river, and listened to the busy hum of
                  city life, until the shades of evening drove the busy throng of men and boys into
                  the shops and dwellings. The busy, noisy river rippled, surged, dashed and rolled
                  its torrents onward, answering, she thought, the melancholy sighings of her
                  desolate heart. And then she imagined that the peaceful, dreamy silence of the
                  habitations of men, and the majestic roar of the cataract, were alike to be
                  considered as tokens of joy that was to come. <emph>Why</emph> she felt this, she
                  knew not, but when the gathering darkness enveloped her, the dejection she had
                  felt had disappeared before the genial rays of Hope.</p>
               <p>"May I come in?" Little Jamie was at the door. Effie took a lighted candle from
                  his hand, and almost forgother cause for sorrow, as she kissed the little fellow,
                  the prototype of the loved and departed Willie.</p>
               <p>"Ma's mean, she is! She had no business to take me off to leave you! She says she
                  wants me to see Grandpa before be dies, but he won't seem half so sweet as you. I
                  wish she wouldn't go away, and then you could stay here."</p>
               <p>"You mustn't call your Ma, mean, Jamie. Your Grandpa is her pa, and the poor old
                  man will be so disappointed if he don't get to see you."</p>
               <p>"Well, I'll have to go, but when I'm a man I'll do what is right,"said ther child,
                  as he gave her a kiss and bounded away, n answer to his mother's call.</p>
               <p>When Effie sought her bed that night, it was to dream of future happiness, which
                  she must pass through weary seasons of trial to again.</p>
               <p>She had lived very economically, and one hundred dollars of her six months
                  earnings had been <emph>cached</emph> away. She hoped<pb n="182-183"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000092"/> that another year of strict frugality would give
                  her means to obtain an education, which she determined to have, at all
                  hazards.</p>
               <p>A dismal foggy morning dawned upon her entrance into her new routine of life. Mrs.
                  Munson was a nervous suffer, and had given place to miserable feelings an nauseous
                  panaceas until life had become an oppresive burden.</p>
               <p>Effie had not been long in her service before the air she breathed, and the
                  constant, fretful and gloomy complaints of the invalid—seriously affected her
                  health: She had always been subject to attacks of blinding headache, but now the
                  malady increased, and she would sometimes be attacked by paroxysms of pain in the
                  temples, severe enough at times to almost deprive her of reason.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Munson could not bear to hear any one complaining, except herself, and
                  Effie's lips, crimson checks, and stifled moans of pain, were sure to be
                  harbingers of a day of unremitting drudgery. Her mistress "had seen girls before
                  who would hire out and then complain, to get rid of work, but nobody could play
                  that game with her."</p>
               <p>Shortly after Effie's instalment into her new home, an unexpected parlor full of
                  company arrived. As it was her business to arrange the tea-table and finish up the
                  polish of everything in the establishment, she proceeded to do her work with
                  alacrity. The thought of "waiting" because she was a servant, did not enter her
                  innocent cranium, and when the guests were seated at the table, she quietly took
                  her accustomed seat.</p>
               <p>"Effie, go to my room and see to Allie. Don't come back till I call you."</p>
               <p>The words were uttered in an impatient and commanding tone. Effie quickly obeyed,
                  but when she reached the baby's crib, the child was sleeping quietly.</p>
               <p>"Don't come back till I call You."</p>
               <p>Could it be possible that hers was henceforth to be the lot of a common servant?
                  She, who had been so kindly cared for in her mother's house, and who during her
                  first six months servitude had been so respectfully treated that she scarcely felt
                  the yoke; was she to be rank with Irish cooks, who were reared in kitchens and had
                  no aspirations beyond their slavish employments?</p>
               <p>To her feverish imagination, the thought was terrible. The merry sound of music
                  and laughter from the rooms below, smote upon her cars with a grating sound.</p>
               <p>It was the first company from which she had been excluded when under the same roof
                  with visitors, since her mother's request to soothe baby Willie to sleep, and had
                  slept herself, before her object was accomplished.</p>
               <p>At ten o'clock, the party started homeward. Effie had fallen asleep upon a lounge
                  in the nursery, before Mrs. Munson entered.</p>
               <p>An impatient shake aroused her.</p>
               <p>"I want to know why you presumed to sit at table with my company?"</p>
               <p>"I meant no offence ma'am," pressing her throbbing temples. "I needed a cup of
                  tea, and though, as there was room for me, I would sit down, I always ate at table
                  with Mrs. Clinton and have done the same here, when you had no company. I didn't
                  mean to displease you."</p>
               <p>"You must remember, hereafter, that no matter how pretty my domestics may consider
                  themselves, I do not allow them to cat with my guests. As it is your first
                  offence, I will overlook it, but I did not know which way to look, when I saw you
                  scat yourself among my acquaintances, as though you were a consequential
                  visitor."</p>
               <p>"Were you ashamed of me?"</p>
               <p>It was a natural question, prompted by her own words,<pb n="184-185"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000093"/> but Mrs. Munson could see nothing but impudence in
                  the artless query.</p>
               <p>"I am not ashamed of my domestics when they are content to observe their true
                  position, but when they presume upon their beauty and try to place themselves at
                  the head of my affairs, then I think it's time to take the conceit out of them! It
                  will not do to give a servant liberty. If I had kept you away from my private
                  table, you woul not have thought of this."</p>
               <p>Effie retreated weeping to her own apartment, and Mrs. Munson, who could easily
                  "magnify a mole-hill to a mountain," considered herself grievously outraged.</p>
               <p>When they had retired to rest, she entertained her sleepy husband as long as he
                  would listen, by a recital of the evening's annoyance.</p>
               <p>"Turn her off if she does'nt suit you and don't bore me to death with servant
                  troubles," he retorted, as he addressed himself to sleep.</p>
               <p>"But I can't get along without her. She is so good to Allie, and so neat and handy
                  about her work, that I really could'nt think of parting with her."</p>
               <p>"Then, if you can't do without her, for mercy's sake treat her with respect. If
                  she is so necessary to our comfort, I'll see to it that she gets the best that's
                  in my house. I have not paid much attention to her yet, but I'll get acquained
                  with her in the morning. One would think, after all the complaints you have made
                  about careless servants, that a pretty girl, who can do your most particular work
                  and still be interesting enough to be an ornament to society. ought not to be
                  found fault with."</p>
               <p>"O, you're a Job's comforter. I wish I had a husband who could sympathize with
                  me."</p>
               <p>"Strike out, and see if you can't find such a one," he relied sleepily.</p>
               <p>A nervous headache drove Mr. Munson from the house at sunrise. He returned at
                  breakfast to find his chamber scented with disagreeable medicinal odors, and the
                  doctor, ever ready to prescribe for his wife's maladies, imaginary and real, had
                  administered a heavy dose of morphine, which had thrown her into a disturbed
                  slumber.</p>
               <p>Effie had been hurried from one part of the house to another, with the baby in her
                  arms, answering the nervous invalid's numerous calls, until the morphine had
                  thrown her into a stupor, and finally appeared at the breakfast table, almost
                  exhausted. She took a seat, opposite Mr. Munson, with Allie struggling in her lap.
                  He noticed that she looked exhausted and weary.</p>
               <p>"Give Allie to me, Effie. I know you must be tired. You look ill. Have you been
                  working very hard?"</p>
               <p>"I am always busy, sir. But before she employed me, Mrs. Munson said that I must
                  work constantly if I lived with her."</p>
               <p>Wouldn't you like to ride out to whore your brother is at work? I am going by
                  there to-day, and Allie and you can ride that far, and return when I do in the
                  evening."</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Munson couldn't spare me. She'll want me every half minute through the
                  day."</p>
               <p>"I want to try an experiment with her. I believe that want of exercise is the
                  basis of her ill health. We'll ride out to-day and give her a chance to wait upon
                  herself."</p>
               <p>Although the roads were rocky and dusty, Effie enjoyed the ride with childish
                  zest. Little Allie was delighted with the roughest jolts, and thew journey to
                  Esquire Crandall's was soon completed.</p>
               <p>"Effie,"said Mr. Monson, kindly, after they had ascended the bluffs and began to
                  roll more swiftly over the rocky road—"you are the very image of my lost Carrie.
                  She died<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6333-00000094"/> when about your age. When I
                  look at you, I feel almost as if the dead lives again."</p>
               <p>"I thought Allie was your only child."</p>
               <p>"No, Mrs. Munson is my second wife. My former wife had two children, Hubert and
                  Carrie. Hubert will be at home in a few days. He has been absent for three years,
                  studying law in Philadelphia. He is but twenty yeas old, but writes that he has
                  mastered most of his studies.</p>
               <p>"O how I wish Herbert and I could get to attend a good school! I used to wish
                  there was no such thing a science, but since so many misfortunes have befel me, I
                  have felt a strong desire to elevate my understanding. But the way is so hedged up
                  I sometimes wish I could die."</p>
               <p>Mr. Munson secretly resolved to give her the advantages which has own daughter
                  would have had, but did not speak of his intention.</p>
               <p>Eliza Crandall was a romping, noisy girl of twelve years, who was much leased with
                  Effie's visit. Mrs. Crandall too Allie in charge, and to Effie's delight, she and
                  Eliza were soon romping over the meadows with a childish pleasure which the child
                  of adversity had not enjoyed for many months. Herbert was plowing about half a
                  mile from the house and they paid him a surprise visit. He was so busily engaged
                  with holding the plow and calling out "haw" and "gee" to the obedient horses, that
                  he did not see his visitors until Effie threw a clod that knocked off his hat.
                  They them darted behind a cluster of bushes, but he caught a glimpse of his
                  sister's sunny curls, left the horses and ran to meet her.</p>
               <p>"Why, sister, your cheeks are too thin but they are as red as roses."</p>
               <p>"No wonder they're red, when I haven't had this much out-door exercise before for
                  half a year."</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Clinton gave you a holiday?"</p>
               <p>"No, but Mr. Munson gave me one. I expect to get such a scolding as poor mortals
                  happily have to endure but seldom, when Mrs. Munson gets hold of me again."</p>
               <p>"What does this mean, sister?"</p>
               <p>"Just what I say. Mrs. Clinton went abroad and have had to look up another home. I
                  went to live with a bear, who wears the mask of a beautiful woman. To prevent
                  herself from too close inspection, she keeps herself surrounded by disagreeable
                  odors, sickening enough to turn the stomach of a stunk."</p>
               <p>"Why, Effie! what kind of talk is that? I did not know that you had left Mrs.
                  Clinton."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>didn't,</emph> she left me. I know that I don't live with her now, you
                  better believe."</p>
               <p>"You seem in good spirits about it."</p>
               <p>"Because, just now I'm free. You wouldn't have thought, last evening, when my
                  mistress had a housefull of company, and I, like a poor innocent simpleton,
                  presumed to scat myself at the end of the table, where there was a vacant scat,
                  and was ordered away because I was a servant, that my spirits were so very
                  good."</p>
               <p>"I'd like to see anybody serve me that way," said Eliza. "About the time a bear
                  drives me off to stay with her cubs, I'll try to retreat to my own kennel."</p>
               <p>"Suppose you had no kennel?" said Effie.</p>
               <p>"'Circumstances alter cases,' I suppose; but I'd try to hunt a stye of some
                  description in which to house myself," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"O, Herbert! I wish we had a little house, and could live together and go to
                  school."</p>
               <p>"We must earn something to live upon first, my dear little philosopher."</p>
               <p>Herbert was admonished by the stamping of his restless steeds that he must not be
                  idle, and with a promise to meet his sister at noon, he went on with his work.</p>
               <pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6333-00000095"/>
               <p>"I tell you," said Eliza, "the fashionables and would-be aristocracy of our famous
                  cities, are many of them too nice to associate with their betters. Mrs. Morton
                  hired Lucy Jonson to do her work and wait upon the children. She had never been
                  out to service before, and committed the unpardonable sin of seating herself at
                  the family, children and all, had finished their repast. She did as directed; but
                  instead of eating the leavings, when the rest left the table, she prepared herself
                  an extra tea. Mrs. Morton scolded, and she replied with an innocent look, 'I
                  thought your supper was nice enough for me, but you appeared to think it wan't, so
                  I am preparing the best the larder affords. Don't be concerned about me, I shall
                  do nicely.'</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Morton was outwitted, and turned her off for spite. Mother was glad to
                  engage her services, and she has lived with us for more than a year. I don't know
                  what we'll do when she gets married; but Pa says I'm big and homely enough to help
                  do the work, and I suppose I am.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Morton has tried many indirect ways to engage Lucy again, but I tel you,
                  girl <emph>can</emph> be independent in Oregon, if they <emph>will</emph> be so.
                  But I know no one in the city who wants me, who will do better by me than Mrs.
                  Munson does. Mr. Munson is very kind, and I'm going to try to stand it a year for
                  his sake and Allie's."</p>
               <p>"May-be, <emph>I</emph> would!" was the sarcastic reply. The winding notes of the
                  dinner horn echoed through the hills and valleys, and sounded musically over the
                  farmer's broad fields.</p>
               <p>"How I love the exhilirating life of the country. It is so different from the
                  enervating, indoor existence of a pent-up town, that I dread the thought of
                  returning to artificial life" said Effie as she was joined by her brother, who was
                  leading his horses to the barn.</p>
               <p>"Sister, I'm going to the mines. This plodding existence won't suit me. The Rogue
                  River diggings are all the rage now, and if you can stay in the city without me,
                  for one year I will then return with gold enough to set you out in style. Before I
                  go, however, I must try to hunt a home for you, where you can be contented. My
                  time here will be out this week, and I will try what I can do."</p>
               <p>"Never min me, brother, I can stay at Mr. Munson's while you are gone.
                     <emph>He</emph> is very kind, and if I do get a scolding occasionally from his
                  wife, I can endure it if I know that you are making a raise for 'the good time
                  coming.'"</p>
               <p>"Very well: I can stand to of you cap, but I would much rather see you more
                  pleasantly situated, if possible."</p>
               <p>Mr. Crandall's house was the abode of kindness and hospitality. The ample board
                  was loaded with the best beef, butter, fruit and vegetables of the season, and the
                  stiff "upper ten" manners of city life were modified by agreeable chat. and the
                  desire of the host and his agreeable lady to make their guests "feel at home."</p>
               <p>The house was a characteristic specimen of Oregon mansions in general, being a
                  large two-story building, with upper and lower verandahs, many windows, and of
                  durable workmanship.</p>
               <p>Most of the rooms were unfurnished, but the clean well-polished fir floors, and
                  the fire-places filled with green oak bushes, and surrounded by numerous flower
                  pots, gave a refreshing appearance to the otherwise undecorated rooms.</p>
               <p>"We intend to have furniture some day; but we do not need such thing badly enough
                  to mortgage our possessions to obtain them. We might spend five thousand dollars
                  for furniture, at the rate it sells in this country, and then we couldn't hardly
                  see it in this house," said Mrs. Crandall, whose practical good sense illustrates
                  the principles and theories entertained by many wives of pioneer farmers.</p>
               <pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6333-00000096"/>
               <p>The visit, like all other pleasant things, came to a close, and when Effie took a
                  sent in the buggy, with Allie in her arms, to return to her mistress, she wondered
                  how the day could have passed so quickly away.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Munson had remained in her room during the forenoon, thinking all manner of
                  bitter things against her husband, who had left with Effie and Allie, not even
                  deigning to tell her when he would return.</p>
               <p>She thought herself the most neglected of miserable mortals, and thinking to spite
                  her husband, she ordered a horse to be saddled and was off for a ride in the
                  afternoon, believing that the exercise would almost finish her existence. Her
                  husband had tried in vain, for many days, to persuade her to ride in the carriage,
                  but Dr. Gwin had for bidden her to do so, and she would not go. She rode away at a
                  brisk pace, and was gone until after her husband's return. Instead being so sick
                  that he would get no sleep that night, as she had predicted, her checks were rosy
                  red; and though tired, she felt no pain. She tried to act cross, but the unusual
                  feeling of returning health made her feel so pleasant that she could not well be
                  angry.</p>
               <p>To her own and her husband's surprise, she slept so soundly that she did not hear
                  even Allie's midnight cry for food, and Mr. Munson fed the babe while she was
                  snoring. It was the first night he had spent at home, without helping his wife to
                  a drink, or the camphor, or a warm free-stone to her feet, or a cold wet cloth to
                  head, for almost two years. He ha become so thoroughly drilled to the ordeal of
                  rising at all hours, that for a long time he had done so as a matter of
                  consequence; not stopping to question her need of his services, but this one
                  night's rest spoiled him. He protested that it was acting against nature for folks
                  to be awake at all hours, and he would not afterwards submit to the trial without
                  so much demurring that she soon became unwilling to trouble him.</p>
               <p>He told her one day, after witnessing some of her overbearing acts, that Effie
                     <emph>must</emph> be kindly dealt with.</p>
               <p>"If you don't teat her as you ought, I will adopt her and board her with some
                  respectable private family and send her to school. She is no common girl, and you
                  must not regard her as such."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Munson resolved to make her husband believe that Effie was kindly treated,
                  but intended to make her feel her bitterness in many ways, and she lived in
                  accordance with her resolution.</p>
               <p>Herbert purchased two Indian ponies,—packed one with provisions, and the other
                  with his blankets and himself—and proceeded to the mines.</p>
               <p>"Never mind, sister," said he, as he gave her a parting kiss, "I won't be gone
                  more than a year, and when I come back, I'll take you out of folk's kitchens."</p>

               <p>During the nights of his absence, Effie had to sleep in her bedroom to answer
                  frequent calls, and wait upon the baby, ad throughout the days, an incessant
                  routine of treadmill duties, kept her constantly employed.</p>
               <p>A young gentlemen called one day, about dinner time, and when the dinner bell
                  rung, Effie, who had learned the rules of society, took Allie with her to the
                  garden. She though<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6333-00000097"/> the handsome,
                  dark-eyed young stranger must be Hubert Munson, but as servants do not get
                  introduction to visitors, she could only judge by his resemblance to his
                  father.</p>
               <p>"Mother, who is that pretty, curly-headed girl in the garden? Why don't you invite
                  her in to dinner?"</p>
               <p>"I'm not in the habit of inviting domestics to eat with my guests. She is a girl
                  who pretends that she never served before she came to Oregon. Mrs. Clinton had her
                  first and nearly ruined her by indulgence, and your father doesn't do much better
                  when he's at home; though I've taught her to know her place when he's gone."</p>
               <p>"Her place <emph>ought to be</emph> among daisies and sunshine and kindness, or
                  I'm no judge of physiognomy."</p>
               <p>"I do wonder if you are going to be as democratic as your father is? I'll cut off
                  those shiny curls of hers one of these days, and see what she'll resemble. She
                  spends half an hour every morning, in brushing them into ringlets."</p>
               <p>Hubert knew his step-mother too well to openly oppose her whims, but his interest
                  in the "Golden-headed bird," as he mentally styled her, was augmented by Mrs.
                  Munson's unpardonable coldness. He hastily finished his dinner and went to the
                  garden where Effie was weaving a coronet of whiter rose-buds and sprigs of
                  forget-me-not, for Allie's head. He introduced himself; talked and laughed with
                  Allie and complimented Effie's skill in wreath-forming until she felt at ease in
                  his presence. She had imagined him to be a stately, demure looking lawyer,
                  glorying in the dignity of his profession and his inapproachable demeaner; but as
                  she listened to his remarks, the thought of "how like his father," made her
                  respect and love him with childish confidence.</p>
               <p>"Come, Effie, come! I don't keep you here to play with flowers. Allow me to
                  introduce you to the dinner table," called Mrs. Munson from the nursery
                  window.</p>
               <p>Hubert took Allie and continued his walk in the garden, hoping that when Effie's
                  duties in doors were done, she would come after him. But when, an hour after she
                  had left his side, he saw her take a seat beside his mother at the nursery window,
                  with her sewing in her hand, he gave up the idea of further conversation with her
                  for that day.</p>
               <p>The next day, when dinner was announced, Effie went again with Allie, to the
                  garden. Hubert looked at his mother with a meaning smile, and saying, "Eat your
                  dinner alone ma'am, I'll wait for better company," he mockingly bowed himself out
                  into the garden and addressed himself to Effie.</p>
               <p>"Why don't you cat you dinner, Mr. Munson?"</p>
               <p>"Don't call me <emph>Mr. Hubert</emph> is my name in my father's home. I choose
                  the company of birds and flowers, always in preference to dinner unless hunger is
                  very impudent."</p>
               <p>"Why, there are no birds in the garden."</p>
               <p>"There are two, Allie and you."</p>
               <p>Effie blushed at this unexpected speech, which she hardly knew whether to accept
                  as compliment, flattery, or satire, and could think of nothing to say in reply.
                  Hubert was a little confused at his own remark, and hardly knew what to say
                  next.</p>
               <p>"Wouldn't you like to attend school?" It was the only question he could think of
                  to ask.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, but I can't go till brother returns from the mines. He started a few
                  weeks ago and expects to be absent about a year."</p>
               <p>"Have you a brother who is grown?"</p>
               <p>"He is not yet seventeen, but he's a man in energy and a gentlemen in
                  principle."</p>
               <p>Effie's cheek glowed with feeling as she spoke thus of her brother, and Hubert,
                  who was not looking for such a spirited remark, was astonished.</p>
               <p>"There is much genuine excellence in this little beauty,<pb n="194-195"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000098"/> and it's bound to develop itself," he mentally
                  ejaculated.</p>
               <p>"Have you no father or mother?"</p>
               <p>He had asked Mrs. Munson the same question, but she had replied that she did not
                  "inquire into the antecedents and pedigrees of her domestics, and she could not
                  see why he should."</p>
               <p>Effie drew a locket from a pocket in the folds of her dress. "My father died when
                  I was but eight years old. Mother died last summer upon the plains. Here are the
                  daguerreotypes of my mother, two brothers and myself, taken when we were in
                  comfortable circumstances. It is almost the only vestige of bygone days that I
                  possess.'</p>
               <p>Mrs. Munson called her and she tripped away to the dining room, to meet her angry
                  frown.</p>
               <p>"The next time a meal is ready, I shall expect you to go to your room and sew
                  until you are summoned," said her mistress, as she sailed out of the room, too
                  angry to meet Hubert's mischievous smile with composure.</p>
               <p>He examined the daguerreotypes with careful scrutiny. The locket contained four
                  places for miniatures, and from each of these, there peeped a handsome,
                  intelligent face.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Goodwin's pale blue eyes, brown, glossy hair, firmly set lips, and pleasing
                  expression, reminded him of a <emph>mother,</emph> who for many years had slept in
                  a silent tomb of an eastern cemetery. Herbert's bold, boyish, handsome face, and
                  Willie's sparkling eyes and broad forehead, he pronounced magnificent. But his
                  eyes dwelt longest upon the dimpled cheeks, rounded shoulders, deep blue eyes, and
                  clear complexion of Effie, whose likeness he pronounced, his ideal of truth and
                  loveliness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Munson returned from California earlier than was expected, and his wife's
                  scheme, for keeping Effie secluded, even at meal-time, was broken up. He ruled in
                  some things, and his intriguing wife knew that it would not do to oppose him when
                  his will was fully roused. After his return, Effie was permitted to sit in the
                  parlor and hear their conversation. Every word of Herbert's narative respecting
                  his life as a student and traveller, she listened to with deep interest.</p>
               <p>"Here, Effie, is the locket you showed me to-day," he remarked in the evening.
                  "You need not be ashamed of <emph>your</emph> family. I know a washerwoman's
                  daughter, who turns up her nose at honest laborers." He glanced meaningly at his
                  step-mother, whose mother he well knew had been a laundress, but she choose to
                  ignore the fact, and nothing fired her temper so quickly as the most distant
                  allusion to her mother's plebian vocation. She left the room in a rage, and the
                  attack of nervous headache which lasted through the night, during which time she
                  kept Effie constantly running to supply her wants, warned her mischievous step-son
                  to refrain from such intimations in the future for Effie's sake.</p>
               <p>"Father, are you going to keep that girl in constant servitude? I wish I was
                  twenty-one. My money should protect her if it was at my disposal."</p>
               <p>"She is too proud-spirited to be dependent. After she has lived with me a year, I
                  intend to offer to board her with women private family give her spending money and
                  pay her tuition fees, as a reward for her extra trouble here. She will learn many
                  things while here, which, though seemingly hard to bear, will prepare her for
                  life's vicissitudes."</p>
               <p>Hubert said nothing further at that time for or against his father's view's,
                  though he could not forbear a thought that it was not half so much for Effie's
                  good as for his wife's wishes and his own peace, that he wished her to "prepare
                  for life's vicissitudes."</p>
               <p>Business soon called Hubert away from home, but his letters always contained
                  tokens of remembrance for his father's protege.</p>
               <p>"<emph>A letter from Herbert!</emph>" Effie exclaimed, one evening<pb n="196-197"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000099"/> as she met Mr. Munson at the door, holding up an
                  envelope directed in her brother's well-known hand-writing.</p>

                           <p>EVER DEAR SISTER:— How I wish you could see mining operations for one
                              day. I am swimming gloriously. The first day after my arrival, whom
                              should I meet but at. O'-Donaldson. 'A fool for luck' is the old adage
                              and I thought it was verified to a certainty, when after prospecting
                              for few unfortunate days, I struck a rich mine where we are almost
                              coining the precious ore. Pat is at work with me as equal partner.
                              Don't get excited over this 'gold news,' for fortune is capricious,
                              and may turn against me at any moment, notwithstanding the present
                              flattering prospect.</p>
                           <p>"A world in miniature is here. I never was in Sodom, but from what I
                              have read of that iniquitous city, I think Yreka or Jacksonville would
                              well compare with it. I should have stated before, that I went first
                              to the Yreka mines, thinking that those of Oregon were not so good;
                              but I could do but little there and did not tarry long.</p>
                           <p>"To give you a description of the daily routine of wickedness that
                              shocks the uninitiated, would be an injustice to your unspotted
                              imagination; but as an idea of life in he mines will interest you, I
                              will give you a brief description of my own experience and
                              observation.</p>
                           <p>"The first thing I done after the goal was reached and O'Donaldson
                              found, was to unpack and liberate my ponies and erect a tent of fir
                              boughs, green with foliage, as a repository for my provisions, gun,
                              &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>"We became discouraged, when at the expiration of the fourth day of
                              search without 'raising the color,' as the miners say, we started for
                              the tent not knowing what to do next. I struck my pick into the ground
                              and gathered up some fagots, with which to cook our supper, and when,
                              with an arm full of wood, I stopped to extricate the pick from the
                              earth up came a piece of the shining lucre! You needn't tell anybody,
                              but when picked up that first piece of virgin gold, I shook as if in
                              an ague fit. It weighs about two dollars. I have found other pieces
                              much larger, but the first one I regard as the pivot upon which my
                              fortune was turned.</p>
                           <p>"We prepare our own bread, beef and coffee, I wonder what Maurice
                              would think if he could see the quantities of <emph>bacon</emph> and
                                 <emph>lard</emph> that are consumed in the mines. I do the cooking
                              and Pat washes the dishes, consisting of a frying-pan, bread-pan, two
                              tin cups and plates, and a pair of jack-knives. Don't laugh. We are as
                              well provided with hardware and cutlery as the oldest miners are. A
                              few bake bread in skillets with lids to them, but scientific miners
                              pronounce them <emph>green.</emph>"</p>
                           <p>"The Sabbath amusements are more shocking to me than all of the week
                              day rowdyisms. 'Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy,' sounds like
                              solemn mockery, if suggested by a conscientious person, among a people
                              who market, trade, race horses, gamble and imbibe strong drink,
                              throughout each holy day. A miner rarely works upon the Sabbath, but
                              he persists in doing what is worse. I trust that one gold hunter at
                              least will not enter the vortex of ruin.</p>
                           <p>"My pocket Bible, which since our mother's death, I am sorry to
                              confess I had sedom opened, proves a welcome friend on Sundays, when I
                              can retire to the mountain 'gulches, 'as we term the rugged gold

                              neatly folded that I had not before discovered it. How my heart

                                          moistening eyes. I feel that my pilgrimage upon earth is
                                          almost ended. When I look upon my loved ones, who will so

               <p>Effie read the letter with emotions of joy and sadness.</p>
               <p>"God of my mother," she exclaimed fervently, "enable us to indeed, 'as seed to
                  serve Thee!'"</p>
               <p>Mothers! Mothers! Have you never penned choice gems of thought for your children
                  to read and profit by, when you shall have departed from earth? If you have not,
                  pray do it now; for the time will come when those you love and for whom you toil
                  and suffer, will look upon your heart-messages, as pearls of countless worth!</p>
               <p>After tea, Effie took the letter into the parlor and gave it to Mr. Munson.</p>
               <p>"Would you like to read it?" she asked. I think it's very interesting, and it's
                  just like Herbert. One moment he will be full of boyish animation, and perhaps the
                  next he will be full of boyish animation, and perhaps the next he will be talking
                  like a preacher. And his letters are just like his conversation."</p>
               <p>"When Effie retired to rest she dreamed of golden mountains and gorgeous splendor,
                  such as in her day-dreams, she had never imagined. She arose the next morning,
                  feverish with an excitement which Hubert's unexpected arrival only augmented.</p>
               <p>At his request she gave him her brother's letter and busied herself with household
                  duties, trying to stay her beating pulse with extra bodily exertion. When the
                  fever cooled, a feeling of extreme lassitude overcame her. She strove against it,
                  but the day was exceedingly warm, and about noon she sunk upon the floor of the
                  dining-room exhausted.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Munson at first accused her of pretending to be ill, but finally became
                  alarmed and sent for Dr. Gwin. He came, but prescribed no remedy except gentle
                  exercise and quietude. She followed his directions and was well as usual in a few
                  days.</p>
               <p>"I don't see why I don't have as good a chance to get well as other folks have,"
                  said Mrs. Munson to her husband and Hubert."</p>
               <p>"I see through it all," replied her husband. "You have money with which to pay
                  doctor bills. Effie has not, and nature cures her."</p>
               <p>"Absurd!" she retorted angrily.</p>
               <p>"Do you believe that Dr. Gwin would have went away without prescribing medicine,
                  if Effie had been a rich man's daughter?"</p>
               <p>"Do you believe doctors are that dishonest?"</p>
               <p>"Many of them are. Of course they must have a living, and it is to their interest
                  for folks to be sick. I know one<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6333-00000101"/> honest
                  physician in Oregon, Dr. West, he keeps a drug store, but says that the less
                  medicine a man takes the better off he is."</p>
               <p>"I shall take medicine at all events," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"I wouldn't be the walking 'apothecary shop' you are, for all the wealth of the
                  Union." said Hubert.</p>
               <p>"When I need a lecture, I'll apply elsewhere for it," was the spiteful rejoinder.
                  And Mrs. Munson left the room.</p>
               <p>"Father, have you read Herbert Goodwin's letter to his sister?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, why?"</p>
               <p>"Because it's a gem in its way, for a boy like him to compose feeling and elevated
                  by a nobleness of soul, speaks in every sentence. I tell you, father, Effie
                  Goodwin's family is, or rather has been, one of no common mould. And more, I tell
                  you plainly that that girl's destiny and mine will be linked together. I would
                  like to see her mind well stored with useful knowledge, but if she cannot be
                  educated, when she gets old enough to marry, I'll take her as she is. I tell you
                  this so that you may decide about how she is to be treated in you house."</p>
               <p>"Your mother cannot spare her now. When her brother returns, she will have time
                  enough to attend to her studies."</p>
               <p>"She live like a galley slave! I'm tired of seeing a girl of her age ruining her
                  form by nursing children, when she ought to be dividing her time between the
                  meadows and the school room. If you tell mother what I have said, she will be more
                  exacting than ever. She doesn't treat her any too well now."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, my son, I <emph>had</emph> hoped that you would not think
                  particularly about the girls for some years to come."</p>
               <p>"Have you ought to say against my ideal, father?"</p>
               <p>"No, I feel a fatherly interest in the girl, but cannot say that I am pleased with
                  your determination. However, I am glad you have been so frank."</p>
               <p>One of the wonders of the world, is the undeniable fact that second wives, no
                  matter how great their faults, always exert an unbounded influence over their
                  husbands, such as the patient and loving "first wife" seldom thinks of assuming.
                  Husbands of second or third wives are not aware of this, but the fact is apparent
                  ot all beholders.</p>
               <p>Second wives and step-mothers are often the embodiments of perfection, but whether
                  they are or not, is all the same with the enamoured consort.</p>
               <p>Munson could not keep his son's secret without the help of his wife, and she gave
                  him no peace until he agreed to tell his son that unless Effie remained with them
                  as a servant during the time for which she had been engaged, he would not consent
                  to the union, but would do all in his power to prevent it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Munson grew more petulent and exacting than ever. Effie could do nothing to
                  please her, and the numerous scoldings she received were very hard for a proud
                  spirit to endure.</p>
               <p>A note of a few lines was concealed in her trunk, which she found time to read and
                  re-read every day; the only words of love that Hubert had yet bestowed upon the
                  trusting lone one, whose spirit cried out night and day for <emph>love.</emph>

               <p>Reader, let us glance at a letter, that on a rainy, dreary Sunday in August,
                  Herbert is reading in his tent with an expression of deepest interest:</p>

                           <p>"I wrote you, my dear brother, in my last epistle, a description of
                              Hubert Munson. What do you think? The accomplished, worthy and noble
                              young man, has declared that he loves me and isn't ashamed to own

                           <p>"I half believe that Mrs. Munson suspects Hubert's attachment for me,
                              for she is crosser than eve, and contrives innumerable devices to keep
                              us from meeting. Mr. Munson treats me kindly, but he begins to affect
                              condescension in his graciousness, and my proud spirit inwardly repels
                              forced urbanity. I wonder if I ever <emph>will</emph> be free?</p>
                           <p>"Don't think your sister is desponding. Far from it. Although the life
                              I am leading is distasteful, yet it might be worse, and perhaps I need
                              this trial to strengthen me for still greater ones.</p>

                              have me for a heart-tried friend, and I have you for the same true
                              blessing. I can't believe that Hubert possesses the least vestige of
                              worldly selfishness. How much his name sounds like your own! But you
                              will say 'that a girl not yet fourteen, had better be thinking of

               <p>MRS. WELDEN speedily prepared for a removal to the abode of her kind friends,
                  whose timely offer of aid, had beamed upon her weary way, like summer rains and
                  sunbeams upon a withering plant. Ada's smile was a soothing balm to her desponding
                  spirit, and Maurice, the tried and faithful friend of other day's was now more
                  anxious than ever to promote her comfort.</p>
               <p>A new life—a tiny infant form—the baby boy of her desolate widowhood, was ushered
                  into existence a few days after she had reached the home of her friends. As she
                  gazed upon it's tiny, dimpled form with maternal fondness, the tears fell thick
                  and fast upon its velvet cheek. She was looking forward to the gloomy array of
                  toil and privation before her; the weary days of toil and hours of anguish, which
                  had been and still would be hers; and the calm tear-drops gave way to stifling
                  sobs.</p>
               <p>Ada was instantly at her side.</p>
               <p>"Come, Meggie, it's too late to cry now. Remember, 'a hen can scratch for a dozen
                  chicks as easily as for one.' See your innocent baby. He's just the image of his
                  father. Here, Johnny, let your bungling nurse arrange your finery to better
                  advantage. Don't cry when <emph>I</emph> take you," affecting a playful mood of
                  importance.</p>
               <p>"O, Ada! how am I to get along with four children, the oldest not yet seven years
                  old?"</p>
               <p>"Remember the adage about the hen and chickens," she replied, as she paced the
                  room with the child who evidently thought himslef roughly handled, tossed to and
                  fro in her arms.</p>
               <p>"You'll <emph>kill</emph> him, Ada," said the mother, anxiously.</p>
               <p>"Now, listen! Here you've been crying like a booby, because you think he'll be an

                  such troubles as this?" she said with an air of drollery that made the invalid
                  smile. "What a pity," she<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6333-00000103"/> resumed,

                  will be of more service to you than all the fashionable medicines and enervating
                  laziness of city life."</p>
               <p>"I'd like to know who'll mind the baby? I always had a nurse in Rockville, who
                  spent all of her time with the children."</p>
               <p>"We'll let Dame Nature nurse 'em here. Now, you're spoiling that child. He'll
                  sleep two-thirds of his first six months into fact and healthfulness, if you'll
                  let him alone. Let me have the care of him. I'll tell you what I'll do. I have a
                  theory of my own about children, and if you'll let me practice it, I'll take the
                  whole management of him into my hands."</p>
               <p>"You can teach me how to manage him. you'll find me eager to learn."</p>
               <p>"Well, if I'm to be teacher, I guess I'll begin at once with my lessons. Don't
                  nurse him only just when he needs attention. Don't humor him to a lighted candle
                  whenever he wants it. Make him know that his couch is his proper place until he
                  gets over baby sleepiness. Maurice can make a little wagon, and Cilia and Howard
                  will delight in drawing him over the prairie in fair weather. Don't allow him
                  anything but his natural nourishment until he gets some teeth. Teach him to love
                  the bath-tub. Follow these directions, and six months will pass away before you
                  begin to know much about trouble with him. Meanwhile, you can jump the rope, climb
                  the hills, run races with the squirrels, and grow blithe and active."</p>
               <p>"If it ever quits raining," she answered, with an impatient sigh. "I thought the
                  'February holidays were the harbingers of spring, but now, the first of March is
                  here, and the rain, mud and fog are more disagreeable than ever."</p>
               <p>"O, Meggie, you're desponding now. Sunshine will come in its proper place."</p>
               <p>"But the Oregon City folks say that we will be compelled to keep fires to
                     <emph>warm by</emph> most of the time, all the summer mornings and
                  evenings."</p>
               <p>"So much the better for us. The evenings and mornings here are always cool. There
                  are poisonous vapors around the dwellings of man that ought to be consumed daily.
                  When summer evening fires are unfashionable, ague is always prevalent. Good fires
                  are as destructive to poisonous vapors as the forked lightnings are. We have but
                  few thunder-storms in this sequestered region, but nature has provided a
                  substitute. We <emph>need</emph> fires regularly, and they answer the purposes of
                  electricity, without being half so dangerous."</p>
               <p>"O, well, you can theorize anything into beauty. I love to hear you explain away
                  my pettish opinions. I had begun to think, but recent experience has proved my
                  arrogance, that I had become proof against my old propensity to pine after lost
                  possessions. Oh! I have passed through so many days of darkness already, and still
                  the weary path of life that I must traverse alone, appears to rugged, that I
                  almost feel compelled to give up the weary struggle of weakness against
                  misfortune."</p>
               <p>"'Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof,' my dear. Herbert Goodwin used to
                  say to his sister, 'Come, Effie, let's not climb the hill till we get to it. 'That
                  advice I now give you, hoping that you won't worry any more about a living, till
                  you begin to grow hungry."</p>
               <p>"But I feel so <emph>dependant</emph> here. If I had means of my own<pb
                     n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6333-00000104"/> to live upon, so that would not feel
                  myself a pensioner, I think I might be contented."</p>
               <p>"If you harp upon that string, you will get Maurice and his matronly wife into a
                  quarrel with you, in which you'll get used up, like Mrs. Green did when she and
                  Mrs. Gray fell out. Mr. Welden and pa were equal partners in all their
                  possessions. I received my share of the remaining possessions, apart from the
                  land, in the effects brought to Oregon. The land is honestly your children's your
                  children's. We are not afraid of losing anything by your sojourn with us, and if
                  we should, it' our own look out, not yours. Now don't talk any more. You are weary
                  and must sleep. The children will stay with me in the back room."</p>
               <p>"Ada, darling, you are the dearest of consolers. Perhaps I won't have such
                  desponding and impatient freaks, when I get stronger."</p>
               <p>"I told you not to talk." putting her hand playfully over the invalid's mouth and
                  imprinting a kiss upon her forehead. "I'm going to enforce order in this house,
                  and one of my strictest rules is that you shall obey me in all things, until you
                  become as healthy as I am," and she left her patient alone.</p>
               <p>"There is a marked difference between splitting rails and studying medicine, Ada,"
                  said Maurice, as he came in from the woods to his dinner."</p>
               <p>"And there is a marked difference between your appearance as a pioneer farmer and
                  a dressed up student," she replied with a smile.</p>
               <p>"Which style do you prefer, gipsy?"</p>
               <p>"A <emph>man</emph> looks better than a <emph>dandy,</emph> if a clean hickory
                  shirt and corduroys <emph>are</emph> considered rather outlandish habiliments for
                  a genteel land proprietor," she answered, glancing at her husband's substantial,
                  unpretending attire.</p>
               <p>"Did you consider me a 'dandy,' when you first saw me at Rockville?"</p>
               <p>"I didn't think much about it. Some one told me that you were preparing yourself
                  for practice, and I could see nothing about you then, but sickening pill-boxes,
                  shelves full of patent medicines, arrays of surgical instruments, and a musty
                  office filled full of medical books, alarmingly suggestive of all manner of the
                  'ills which flesh is heir to.'"</p>
               <p>"But you've been foolish enough to become the wife of such medley of
                  monstrosities, notwithstanding first impressions."</p>
               <p>"I found that you were unlike any doctor I ever saw, and I admired your
                  singularity."</p>
               <p>"Justly say you began to love me, and make a clean breast of it, pet."</p>
               <p>"No, I <emph>didn't.</emph> I'm not over sentimental any how; I never cared very
                  much about you until after we left Platte River, that's a fact."</p>
               <p>"What made you care so much for me <emph>then?</emph> As you've begun to relate
                  your experience, I'd like to hear it through. I have been certain of your regard
                  ever since that memorable conversation under the cottonwoods; do you recollect?
                  Let's hear the whole story, puss."</p>
               <p>Ada's mood changed instantly from levity to seriousness, as she threw up the locks
                  that shaded her husband's forehead and looked into his eyes with wife-like
                  trust.</p>
               <p>"I can't talk over the circumstances of our courtship and marriage, without
                  recalling sorrowful scenes. if my parents were living now, and could see how
                  happily we get along together, in spite of poverty, I am sure they would not think
                  that I had wronged them. But I haven't answered your question. When we left you so
                  abruptly upon the Plains, my fountain of affection, so deep that it had lain
                  comparatively dormant, while everything went on smoothly, was<pb n="208-209"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000105"/> stirred by sudden emotion. 'Still water is deep,'
                  is an old saying, but we know that when still water is forced into action, it has
                  power in proportion to its depth."</p>
               <p>"Well argued, my sensible philosopher," said Maurice, kissing her fondly. "I'd
                  rather hear your calm reasoning than all the sentimental silliness that was ever
                  spoken by shallow-pated lovers."</p>
               <p>"It's changing the subject a little, but I would like to know when you mean to
                  write to your father? he would be glad to know where you are and what you are
                  doing."</p>
               <p>"I sent him a copy of the 'Weekly ——,' containing a marked notice of our marriage,
                  but I will not write until I can tell him that I have plenty of this world's
                  goods, and a home he needn't be ashamed to see me occupy."</p>
               <p>"Why not, Maurice?"</p>
               <p>"He was so cross with me because I couldn't fancy pill-making and drug-mixing,
                  that I want him to know that I'm able to live without the least help from him,
                  before I begin a correspondence."</p>
               <p>"I thought your father was a Hydropathic physician."</p>
               <p>"No, he strongly advocates pills and pork. I believe myself, that they ought to be
                  classed together."</p>
               <p>"Where did you get your theory respecting hygiene?"</p>
               <p>"From nature and observation and you."</p>
               <p>"From <emph>me?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Yes, you."</p>
               <p>"What do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"I had a theory of my own before I saw you, but never had the courage to reduce it
                  to practice until I remarked your glowing cheeks and perfect health. I observed
                  one day to your father that yours was the most healthful countenance with which I
                  was acquainted. 'Yes,' he replied, 'and nature has reared her, is the only reason.
                  If my early life had been spent as hers has been, I would live to be an old man,
                  but drugs, long ago, ruined my constitution. The secret of Ada's good health is
                  proper clothing, bathing, exercise and food, and <emph>no</emph> strong medicine.'
                  Although I was studying medicine in an Allopathic college, I from that moment
                  resolved to follow no dictates but those of nature, common sense and conscience.
                  How well I have observed that resolution, you can judge."</p>
               <p>"I am satisfied with the result, Maurice. And we'll see what nature can do for
                  Meggie and the children, before a great while."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Welden awoke from a refreshing sleep. Ada was listening for her slightest
                  movement, and entering the room, she drew aside a window curtain and bade her look
                  out upon an undulating landscape that was illumined by a flood of mellow radience
                  from the setting sun.</p>
               <p>"How lovely are thy works, O Lord," she murmered, as she gazed upon the beauteous
                  scene. Groves of dark evergreens were scattered here and there over the natural
                  meadow; hazel thickets were begining to show early buds; the sweet bunch grass was
                  waving in regular windrows in the pleasant breeze, and the knotty white-oaks—not
                  yet showing signs of returning vegetation—were alive with the music of wrens and
                  meadow-larks.</p>
               <p>An eddying breeze stirred the boughs of the gigantic oak near the window, and ten
                  thousand pearly rain drops, burnished by the sun-rays, dropped from the naked
                  branches, and the agitation of the tree was stilled.</p>
               <p>"How could I have been so peevish this morning, I wonder? As if the rain were
                  unnecessary, I was complaining of its visits. Ada, you must have a very poor
                  opinion of my boasted trust in the Lord, when you hear me complaining so peevishly
                  of what He does."</p>
               <p>"O no, Meggie, you were nervous and weary this morning, and your mind naturally
                  turned to melancholy reflections.<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6333-00000106"/> You
                  are now refreshed, and can see beauty in the things you would have complained of a
                  few hours ago."</p>
               <p>"Dear girl, you can show me excellencies in myself that I cannot discover without
                  your aid. If my latent good had been proclaimed to my associates in days gone by,
                  by such a chronicler as you, much that I have done amiss, might not now be thrown
                  between me and happiness.</p>
               <p>"Let by-gones be by-gones, my dear friend. You and I, in this delightfol haunt,
                  will have few necessities, and <emph>may</emph> have few aspirations.</p>
               <p>"Let us see how easily happiness can be secured, if we are only willing to accept
                  it at the hands of God and nature."</p>
               <p>As Mrs. Welden's health improved, she began to live, as Ada said, "half of the
                  time in the hills." The feeble step and languid motion was gone, and when Johnnie
                  was three months old his mother looked as healthy and vigorous as he did. The
                  older children grew tough and tawny, and although their fastidious mother at first
                  disliked the idea of their wearing coarse substantial clothing, she soon found
                  that she could afford no other for everyday wear. She soon became accustomed to
                  the change from plaids, merinos, and embroideries, to drillings and calicoes,
                  though her handiwork in the fitting of garments and arrangement of proper blending
                  and contrasting colors was so different from the taste, or rather want of it among
                  the most of her neighbors, that their clothing never looked "shabby" or
                  "common."</p>
               <p>A few years passed fleetly away, and no one would have scarcely recognised in the
                  gentle, subdued and winning manner of the widow, the pettish exacting, selfish,
                  and haughty person whom we first introduced to the reader as the wife of John
                  Welden, the retail merchant.</p>
               <p>She was indebted to her benefactor for countless favors, but they would receive no
                  remuneration for their services, in consequence of which she resolved to give the
                  destitute the spare means at her disposal.</p>
               <p>She obtained plain sewing to do for bachelor neighbors, and, as her work commanded
                  a high price, she gradually added to her stock of comforts, until when her four
                  years residence were completed, the land which she could not have obtained without
                  the help of friends, was sold for a handsome sum. With this she fitted-up a snug
                  little home upon her childrens' claim, where she was soon surrounded by happiness,
                  prosperity, and contentment. Three miles from her abode was an academy, which her
                  children attended in all weather, without danger of catching fashionable
                  colds.</p>
               <p>Her Gothic, vine-clad cottage was situated on an eminence overlooking the broad,
                  dark Willamette river; deep green forests of pine and fir—romantic hills, valleys,
                  and mountains—and many acres of undulating fern and grass-covered prarie, over
                  which, in early summer, wild flowers and wild strawberries vied with each other in
                  the enjoyment they bestowed so lavishly on mankind.</p>
               <p>Ada was visiting with her one afternoon, shortly after the new cottage had been
                  erected, and they were standing upon the portico, speaking of the contrast between
                  the Ohio and Willamette rivers, when Mrs. Welden related the following
                  incident:</p>
               <p>"It was a bleak November evening, and I was standing in the verandah or my
                  Rockville home, and looking through the thinly-falling snow-flakes towards the
                  crushing ice, which was fast forming into a solid, mighty, chrystal bridge across
                  the lovely river. The wind howled fitfully through the lattice, and I drew the
                  folds of a cashmere shawl closely around my head and shoulders. I was indulging in
                  a deep reverie, which might have continued until dark, but for a wretched-looking
                  mendicant who mounted the steps and besought me,<pb n="212-213"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000107"/> I thought rather impudently, for charity. I
                  repulsed her with bitter scorn, and thought no more about her until a week
                  afterwards, when I learned that she had perished of hunger and cold in a rude hut
                  in the grocery end of the village. The night after Johnnie was born, I dreamed
                  that she came to me, mocking my desolation and cursing me horribly—I awoke in the
                  fright, but never had the courage to tell you of this until now."</p>
               <p>Ada's lustrous orbs filled with tears. "I remember the beggar and the circumstance
                  well, but did not knew that she had been in need of food till it was too late to
                  help her.—Her husband was a confirmed inebriate, and it is said he abused her
                  shamefully."</p>
               <p>"I awoke from that horrible dream, determined to make amends as far as possible
                  for my selfish acts, by dividing my stores, when I had them, in the future. 'There
                  is that scattereth and yet increaseth, and there is that withholdeth more than is
                  meet, but it tendeth to poverty."</p>
               <p>"Do you know Meggie I sometimes thought that you were too liberal for a widow of
                  your scanty resources. One fall in particular, you gave away so much of your
                  winter's provisions, to a family of sick immigrants, that I was almost vexed with
                  you. I shall not have such thoughts again. We won't go wrong, if we'll obey Holy
                  Writ." <q>

                           <p>"This evening, my dearest one, I arrived at the St. Nicholas and
                              engaged lodgings for a fortnight, ate my dinner,<pb n="214-215"
                                 xml:id="VAC6333-00000108"/> strolled down Broadway until tired, and
                              then sought my room to write to you.</p>
                           <p>"You no doubt have wondered at my unaccountable absence, as I have no
                              idea that my worthy father has deemed it advisable to inform you of my
                              whereabouts. I trust that the course he pursued with me is at least
                              judicious, even if it does seem unkind. He told me, the morning before
                              I last saw you, that he desired me to travel and see as much of the
                              world as possible, while you are preparing yourself for the duties of
                              life. Of course, the thought of leaving you was painful, but I could
                              see no way to ameliorate your condition at present, and I believe my
                              parents will treat you much better when I am absent, in consideration
                              of your future destiny, than they would if I were near you.</p>
                           <p>"When your year of servitude, which may father persists in saying will
                              fit you for self-reliance in days to come, (though to be candid with
                              you, I don't believe he'd think of that if his wife thought she could
                              spare you,) shall have passed away, you can then attend the Institute,
                              where a few years' application to study, will fit you for any station.
                              You are perfect now in my eyes, but for your own good, I wish you to
                              learn the sciences. I will keep a journal of my travels over the
                              world, and sketch many scenes of beauty and interest for your tasteful
                              eye, knowing that you will prize them highly for the artist's
                              sake.</p>
                           <p>"A few years will make some difference in your personal appearance,
                              but the golden ringlets, deep blue eyes, dimpled cheeks, and rosy
                              lips, beautified by a purity of expression, all your own, time will
                              only clothe with deeper loveliness.</p>
                           <p>"Your miniature, I prize as a beacon to guide me in the path of virtue
                              and honor; and I did not need that truthful expression of yours, 'I'll
                              look at this if tempted to do what is wrong,' to make me believe that
                              the likeness of my 'honorable self' will be duly prized by its fair
                              possessor.</p>
                           <p>"The way I left you, like a cowardly culprit, is my worst
                              mortification, but father said it must be so. He said that if you had
                              proper confidence in my integrity, you would not distrust me, and that
                              you are too young to be capable of knowing what you do want, although
                              he admits that you are dear to him because you resemble my departed
                              sister.</p>
                           <p>"I told him that if childishness had made you what you are, I hoped
                              that time would never change you. I believe he is secretly pleased
                              with the whole arrangement, although he will not lay aside his dignity
                              to say so.</p>
                           <p>"I could indulge in a thousand passionate expressions of my regard for
                              you, but will keep them for future occasions, which, though years must
                              pass before we meet, I often realize in the sweet visions of the
                              might, when I seem to tread the flowery foot-paths of gentle
                              eminences, gather flowers in the shady dells, or listen to the roaring
                              waterfall, with you by my side, whom even now I presume to call
                                 '<emph>my own sweet wife.</emph>
                           </p>
                           <p>"I will not wrong you by requesting you to remember me. <emph>I know
                                 you will.</emph> My letters will often visit you, but I can get
                              none from you at present. If you will write when you receive this, and
                              direct to Lisbon, I will probably receive your letter, as I will visit
                              Portugal before spring. But my second gilt-edged sheet is full. I'll
                              try a sheet of foolscap next time, perhaps I can pen what I wish to
                              upon its ample pages.</p>
                           <p>"Show this letter to my father. I wish him to know that I do nothing
                              clandestinely.</p>
                           <p>"<emph>Thou knowest that I love thee!</emph>"</p>

               <p>Another letter was clasped in Effie's hand, but her usual ardor about reading
                  Herbert's epistles, was this time checked by the written words of another and
                  dearer hand.</p>
               <p>The dark sorrow that had clouded her existence for three weary months; the feeling
                  that she had been the suffering object of an impulsive young man's duplicity,
                  which her mistress had intimated a score of times, was now cleared away and she
                  was happy. Hope is the heart's own solace, but suspense quickly bringeth despair.
                  She was aroused by an angry command from Mrs. Munson, who ordered her to "prepare
                  the tea-table, and not mope herself to death."</p>
               <p>She hurriedly placed the letters in her Bible and ran down stairs without closing
                  her chamber door.</p>
               <p>It was late before she was again permitted to seek her chamber, and when she again
                  opened the Bible, her letter,<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6333-00000109"/>
                  <emph>the</emph> letter was gone! Whose work was this? No one could have visited
                  her room except Mrs. Munson. Could it be possible that she had purloined it? If
                  so, for what purpose? She thought of asking her for it, but stood too much in awe
                  of her mistress to do so. She was too much disturbed by the loss of Hubert's
                  letter to read Herbert's message that evening, and throwing herself upon a bed,
                  she wept herself to sleep.</p>
               <p>In Mrs. Munson's boudoir, another scene was transpiring. She possessed a tact of
                  imitating handwriting, and with Hubert's heart-message before her as a copy, she
                  penned a letter to suit her own fancy for her husband's eye, the purport of which
                  was that Hubert hoped that Effie would forget him. He had thought her engaging and
                  pretty when in her company, but a conquest he had made in a New York ball-room had
                  eclipsed his ideal so completely that he had determined not to fulfil the boyish
                  engagement. The envelope that had covered the real letter, encased the spurious
                  one and the easily blinded husband and father, had no reason to suspect his wife's
                  designings. Effie's swollen eyes and abstracted manner also helped to convince him
                  that she had first received the letter and was grieving over his sons's
                  inconstancy. He suddenly grew very generous and decided that she should attend
                  school until her brother should return from the mines and pay her board by doing
                  chores of evenings and Saturdays. His wife remonstrated, but he was inflexible,
                  and the next Monday morning found Effie among a school room full of girls between
                  ten and twenty years of age.</p>
               <p>Eliza Crandall, whose ready wit made her a universal favorite among those who
                  happened to suit her fancy, introduced the new scholar to her friends as an
                  intimate acquaintance, taking the liberty to explain the general rules of the
                  school, and doing all in her power to make herself agreeable.</p>
               <p>"Who <emph>is</emph> she, anyhow?" queried Delphine Howard, turning to her
                  particular friend, Augusta Morton.</p>
               <p>"Nobody but Mrs. Munson's servant," was the charitable reply. "What business she
                  has to come here, is more than I can imagine. The free school is the place for
                  paupers."</p>
               <p>"And Mr. Barton's school <emph>should be</emph> the place for ladies," said Eliza
                  boldly. "How our usually far-sighted preceptor could so far overstep the bounds of
                  propriety as to admit such as you into his fold, is a mystery to me. But money
                  covers a multitude of sins, and cloaks any amount of shocking vulgarity."</p>
               <p>Her retort raised such a laugh that no reply could be heard, and the two
                  exclusives walked away to the farthest corner of the recitation room. Effie, who
                  had heard their unkind criticism of herself, choked back the rising sobs and tried
                  to be sociable with her friend and the numerous other girls who were always ready
                  to notice whoever their leader choose to befriend.</p>
               <p>Bartholomew Barton, A. M., was a benevolent looking gentleman, who deigned to
                  bestow a benign smile upon his newly installed pupil as he entered the room. He
                  appointed her various studies, and gave her a seat next to Eliza Crandall, in
                  courteous compliance with her timid request.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Barton, an amiable lady, with glossy black hair and stately, measured
                  carriage, was the dignified principal of the female department.</p>
               <p>There were several subordinate teachers, or as the girls dubbed them "subs," who
                  took charge of the various classes—Mrs. Barton's office being to enforce order,
                  see that no lessons were omitted, and superintend the musical department.</p>
               <p>Effie dipped into her studies with a zest which astonished her teachers. The
                  constant drudgery she had endured for so long, had not injured her natural
                  intellect, but on the contrary, comparatively degraded position she had
                     occupied<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6333-00000110"/> had awakened such a desire
                  to prepare herself for a higher sphere, that she was not content to pass an idle
                  moment.</p>
               <p>Some of the girls called her the kitchen student, and other epithets of a like
                  character, very annoying to a proud spirit.</p>
               <p>She would not resent their insinuations herself, but she had no necessity for
                  doing so whenever Eliza Crandall was present.</p>
               <p>The winter was rainy, chilly and disagreeable; so little like the feathery
                  snow-flakes and biting frosts of her childhood's home, that she often pined for
                  the clear, white, rustic habitation of her early life.</p>
               <p>School had closed one evening, and she, with a noisy party of other girls, was
                  standing upon the slippery stones in front of the Institute, when the stage-coach
                  was seen through the driving mist, making its way through the muddy slush of Main
                  street.</p>
               <p>"Girls, will some of you please to go with me to the post office? I believe I have
                  letters there, and I don't like to go alone."</p>
               <p>"<emph>A love letter!</emph> That's it! now own up, kitchen wench!" said Augusta
                  Morton, spitefully.</p>
               <p>Tears came to Effie's eyes.</p>
               <p>"Kitchen wenches are above snapping turtles," said Eliza.</p>
               <p>"Effie gets out of the way, and considers the source it comes from, when you snap
                  at her. She treats you just as the moon did the puppy."</p>
               <p>"How was that," queried one of the girls, always eager to get their Punch to tell
                  them a story.</p>
               <p>"Why, you ignoramus! Are you like the family in the back-woods? In the dark about
                  common things. Well, I'll enlighten you, because I'm compassionate."</p>
               <p>You know, I suppose, that the moon is naturally a much more important object than
                  a puppy. Master poodle didn't think so, and to assert his superiority, he barked
                  most impudently pudently at our majestic Luna. She didn't deign to notice him, but
                  kept on shining as though there was no such a thing as an impudent puppy on this
                  green earth. If she could see through the mist of an Oregon winter, she'd see
                  impertinence enough in some of the members of our City Institute.</p>
               <p>"I must hurry," said Effie. "Eliza, will you go with me to the post office?"</p>
               <p>"I will go, said Winnie Holmes. "Eliza promised to go home with Allie Winslow. She
                  lives two miles from town."</p>
               <p>"Thank you Winnie," and the girls started off, picking their way as best they
                  could, along the slippery, hilly sidewalks, towards the busy, crowded buzz of Main
                  street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Munson was in the post office, and Effie almost fainted as she met his
                  enquiring glances.</p>
               <p>Winnie spoke. "Are there letters here for Effie Goodwin?"</p>
               <p>"Two of them," replied the post master, an old gentleman who was busily engaged in
                  distributing letters and periodicals, as he handed her the coveted treasures.</p>
               <p>Effie hurried out of the office and Winnie, who had judged from her perturbation
                  that the letters, one or both of them, concerned her very deeply, had just time
                  enough to say playfully, "I can tell now what made you discover the stage coach so
                  easily," when Munson stepped into the street.</p>
               <p>"I'll walk home with you, Effie. Miss Winnie need not take the trouble to
                  accompany you. It's going to rain again in a few minutes."</p>
               <p>"Good-night, Winnie."</p>
               <p>"Good-bye; may pleasant dreams and happy thoughts keep you company." And the happy
                  daughters of prosperity walked musingly homeward.</p>
               <p>Effie glanced at Mr. Munson.</p>
               <p>"Did you think I would not fetch your letters this evening?" he asked sternly.</p>
               <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6333-00000111"/>
               <p>Effie did not doubt his honesty. She could not tell him that she doubted his
                  wife.</p>
               <p>"I thought I would go to the post office myself <emph>one</emph> time. I had never
                  been that far up town before, and I have lived here about eighteen months. Was
                  there anything improper in my going?"</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Munson looked for you to come to Allie before I left the house. You should
                  always hasten home after school is dismissed.</p>
               <p>"I didn't mean to displease you."</p>
               <p>"Ah, well; we won't quarrel about it. Hereafter, you'll know what to do. What post
                  marks are on your letters?"</p>
               <p>"One is Havre, the other, Jacksonville."</p>
               <p>"Have you a letter from Hubert?"</p>
               <p>"I suppose so. I have no other correspondent in foreign countries."</p>
               <p>"How long since you received the last one?'</p>
               <p>"Let me see. I got one the first of December. It's now the last of January—two
                  months have passed since I received the last one. I would have shown you the
                  letter, but it was lost in some mysterious manner, and I have not seen it since
                  the evening it came to hand."</p>
               <p>The rain began to descend in torrents, and their anxiety to get home precluded
                  further conversation.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Munson was attacked with a fit of hysteria, and Effie could not get to read
                  her letters till near midnight. Opiates finally gained the ascendency over
                  affected nerves, and when Mrs. Munson fell into a disturbed slumber, Effie gladly
                  retired to her room, where her letters had been carefully locked up in her
                  trunk.</p>
               <p>Hubert's was the first one opened.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"The journey over the rolling seas; the constant excitement of seeing and
                     hearing something interesting and new; the fatigue of traveling, and
                     acquaintance of foreign belles cannot force my imagination from the
                     all-absorbing theme of my future life and you. I grow home-sick in spite of
                     constant action. The greatest enjoyment I experience is in sketching those
                     promised curiosities for your edification; a business in which all my leisure
                     hours are occupied.</p>
                  <p>"I have seen many wonders of the eastern world. Paris, with its countless
                     objects of amusement and instruction; its gay belles of fashion and genial
                     atmosphere; foggy, dreary, busy London; the beautiful rural scenery of Great
                     Britain, and France; <emph>all</emph> would amuse and instruct you. I almost
                     wish that I had waited until you could accompany me, before making this tour. I
                     see you blush and smile, and hear you say, 'I don't want to travel any more."
                     Well, Iam glad, my own dear one, that you are domestic in your notions and
                     aspirations. You may need all your natural skill in transforming me from a
                     roving student into a hum-drum gentleman, a pattern husband, whose delight will
                     be a peerless wife and lovely rural home, away from the turmoil of busy life
                     and care and vexation. You will believe me when I say that for your sake I am
                     anxious to return to Oregon. You can understand my meaning also, when I tell
                     you that for your sake I will at present remain away.</p>
                  <p>"You are now past fourteen years of age. You and I both dislike early
                     engagements, yet, as Cupid is blind, even so are his victims. I wish to see you

                     developed. Superior to the weak and suffering of your sex, who thought marriage
                     the chief aim of their existence, until encumbered with life's arduous duties,
                     and who now say that had they known the trials in store for them, they would
                     never have married. Such cases of repentance after marriage are quite too
                     common. I want the wife of my bosom, whom I shall love as my other self, whose
                     every thought and action should be in unison with mine, to know something about
                     the weary road of life. We must not look forward to a life of unalloyed
                     pleasure.</p>

                     are these plain and real, heart-spoken feelings of the soul. You are now the
                     embodiment of all that is pure and trustworthy and true. But my own dear little
                     treasure, you imagine but little concerning this treacherous object, this

                     guard against, is the art of fliration so common with young ladies attending
                     school. Truth is your beacon star, let Virtue and Honor be the helm to guide
                     you in the highway of maidenly duty.</p>

                     of daily travel. Show him this, as well as my other letters, that he may know
                     that my sentiments in regard to you remain unchanged. With many imaginary

                     behaved like a gentleman, doing half the work and pocketing half the gains
                     until our claim was thoroughly worked. We each possessed the comfortable little
                     sum of eight thousand dollars, and I tried hard to persuade him to keep his
                     money and return with me to the valley. He promised to do so, but while we were
                     waiting for better weather, he was induced to drink and gamble, and some
                     sharpers soon seized the last dollar of his hard earnings. He raved. They
                     taunted him. He grew furious and felled the ringleader to the ground by a
                     skilful stroke of his shillelah. The fellow did not arise, and when, a half
                     hour afterwards, we tried to arouse him, <emph>he was dead.</emph> What an
                     awful scene! A gambler hurried into the presence of his Maker, without a
                     second's warning! 'Man giveth up the ghost, and where <emph>is</emph> he I have
                     seen enough of a miner's life, and am sick of witnessing the appaling acts of
                     iniquity that are everywhere visible. It is true, the miners have their laws,
                     respecting order and government with republican spirit; but the more refined
                     acts of civilization—the decorum of speech and action—the honor due to the God
                     of the Universe; the religious observance of the Sabbath: these things are
                     scoffed at, ridiculed!</p>

                     bitterly did he begin to reap the reward of wrong doing. I visited him in the
                     evening. He confessed that he was sorry he had gambled, but declared that he
                     did right in killing his tempter. I tried to show him wherein he had done
                     wrong, but he would not be convinced. I left him with a heavy heart.</p>
                  <p>"At his dictation, and in compliance with his request, I penned a brief history
                     of his past life, which he requested me to convey to Maurice Stanton. Last
                     night a mob collected around the jail, forced open the door of his cell, and
                     hung him without judge or jury! But I will not dwell upon this sorrowful
                     subject longer.</p>

                  she sat down and wrote a long letter, informing Hubert of her suspicions. She
                  wrote concerning her school; of Herbert's anticipated return; of her own feelings,
                  so harmoniously responsive to his own; with such good sense, sound logic, and

               <p>Mrs. Munson met Effie the next morning at the breakfast table.</p>
               <p>"I shall keep you out of school to-day, Miss Pert. You waste so much time after
                  school hours, that I can't afford to board you for your work."</p>
               <p>The last evening was the first that she had overstayed her time a moment. She
                  arose with a haughty demeanor that she had never before ventured to assume in that
                  imperious presence.</p>
               <p>"I am going this morning to bid my jail good bye. I shall <emph>board</emph> until
                  Herbert returns from the mines. Had it not been for your last exacting
                  requirement, I should perhaps have given you a few days warning."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Munson looked as if she could have "bitten" her with a good will. She could
                  not speak for surprise and rage, and Mr. Munson replied:</p>
               <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6333-00000114"/>
               <p>"I think that step is hardly prudent, Effie. You will find that board at five or
                  six dollars a week, will amount to a few hundreds in a short time."</p>
               <p>"My brother writes that he is amply able to give me an education, and wishes me to
                  devote my evenings to study."</p>
               <p>She went to her chamber to pack her wardrobe and closed the door just as she
                  caught Mrs. Munson's words, "I have always noticed that if beggars are exalted
                  ever so little, they'll act like free negroes." She did not hear Mr. Munson's
                  reply, or the sealding tears she shed over the open trunk would have been deprived
                  of half their bitterness.</p>
               <p>"I consider that she is no more of a beggar than I am. She has worked honestly and
                  faithfully for a living, and should not be blamed for seeking to better her
                  condition. How would you like to be treated as she has been?"</p>
               <p>"That's the way a wife gets consolation! What is to become of Allie?
                     <emph>I</emph> can't take care of her."</p>
               <p>"You are as able to wait upon her as Effie is," he replied impatiently, as he
                  arose to leave the room, lest he should hear some provoking reply. He entered the
                  parlor, and Effie went to the door with swollen eyes.</p>
               <p>"Here are my letters, you may read them if you wish." She tossed them into his
                  hands and again sought her chamber, where she managed to cool her throbbing
                  temples by bathing her ace and head in cold water. When she was ready to depart,
                  she again went to the parlor door. She thought her master acted confused as he
                  grasped her hand and said, "if you are to be my future daughter, as this last
                  letter of Hubert's indicates, I desire you to consider me as your father, and I
                  will do anything in my power to make you happy. I thought this love affair was
                  settled, from the purport of Hubert's first letter to you, but there is a singular
                  contradiction of ideas in the two epistles."</p>
               <p>"Have you seen his first letter? Do you know where it is?" she asked eagerly.</p>
               <p>"If you are going to leave my house, it's time you were starting," exclaimed Mrs.
                  Munson hastily, as she entered the parlor. She had overheard their conversation,
                  and was determined to prevent further explanation.</p>
               <p>"I'll take your trunk to Mr. Holmes' this evening in the buggy," said her host
                  kindly, as he accompanied her to the door.</p>
               <p>"Thank you," you," she replied falteringly, as she turned away from her "prison
                  house," as she was wont, in after years, to style the home where she had known so
                  many sorrows.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Holmes was willing and anxious to receive her as a boarder, and the hours she
                  spent in Winnie's engaging company, were replete with happiness.</p>

               <p>"COME BIDDY! confess! "Who is the wight of your engaging conquests? Or have you
                  received the mitten in your last letter from Teddy or Jerry?" queried Delphine
                  Howard, as Effie entered the noisy school-room in company with Winnie Holmes.</p>
               <p>"If it were not beneath the dignity of a lady to notice such insults, I would
                  teach you a lesson of humility," said Winnie. "Miss Effie Goodwin is a respectable
                  boarder at my father's house, and I will not listen to such impertinent remarks
                  concerning our family guests."</p>
               <p>"Ma, called upon Mrs. Munson yesterday, and she said<pb n="228-229"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000115"/> that she was going to keep her an indefinite length
                  of time."</p>
               <p>"Which indefinite length of time, expired this morning," said Effie.</p>
               <p>"Effie has a brother, who will soon be in from the mines with a 'pocket full of
                  rocks.' Such girls as you and Augusta Morton will go off into ecstacies about him,
                  badly as you have treated his sister," said Eliza Crandall, joining the
                  chattering, noisy group.</p>
               <p>"You think I'll fancy him because you do," said Delphine, sneeringly.</p>
               <p>"You couldn't follow a more ennobling example," was the playful retort.</p>
               <p>"'Self-praise is half scandal,'" chimed in Augusta.</p>
               <p>"Why, snapping Turtle!" affecting to have just discovered her, "where did you
                  spring from?"</p>
               <p>The measured step of Bartholomew Barton, A.M., was heard in the hall, and the
                  girls instantly seated themselves with their books, as though study was their most
                  absorbing occupation. The Professor spent a few moments in the recitation room of
                  the girls, in superintending their various studies, and appointing to each
                  assistant her manifold duties for the day. When this nominal task was completed,
                  he bowed himself out, an act of courtesy to which the misses were required to
                  respond, and Mr. Barton assumed for the remainder of the day, the difficult task
                  of keeping up the semblance of order.</p>
               <p>This morning however, the Principal summoned the boys—about fifty in number—into
                  the recitation room of the female department, and announced his" rules,
                  regulations and requirements, for the coming spring exhibition."</p>
               <p>Excitement was on tiptoe. The girls, many of them with rueful faces, in
                  anticipation of writing the compositions they detested, made all manner of
                  complaints of each other and their teachers. The Principal and his lady did not
                  hear their muttered exclamations of dissatisfaction, or measures would have been
                  taken of suppress them.</p>
               <p>We have often, when listening to the whining complaints of composition-writing
                  schoolmates, wondered why it was that they made themselves so miserable over what
                  was such a source of improvement and what <emph>might be</emph> such a delightful
                  occupation. A group of school girls are assembled, and one begins her story.</p>
               <p>"Those dreadful compositions! I wish they had never been thought of! I'd rather
                  stand at the whipping-post, in the power of a negro driver, than to get up and
                  read one of my own productions before a crowd."</p>
               <p>"And I'd rather do with half allowance and sleep on beds of nettles, than arrange
                  my shallow thoughts for eyes and ears of critics."</p>
               <p>And another. "O, Mary, if I could write as you do, I wouldn't care who'd hear my
                  efforts," when Mary knows that the complainer is very vain of her own work, but
                  applauds <emph>her</emph> to affect modesty. This, and similar "small talk" in
                  which each one tries to form a more exaggerated estimate of her unassuming
                  diffidence than the previous speaker has indulged, make up the sum total of most
                  young school-girls talk about necessary mental exercise.</p>
               <p>For shame girls! If you think you're clever—and what school-girl doesn't—be as
                  modest about it as possible, but cease making yourselves ridiculous, with these
                  silly exaggerations.</p>
               <p>"What do you think of our coming exhibition, Effie?" asked Carrie Winters, at
                  noontime, when they were all disertating upon their coming troubles.</p>
               <p>"I think those who complain least and work most, will gain the greatest
                  victories."</p>
               <p>"Don't you dread the exhibition?"</p>
               <p>"I can't say that I do."</p>
               <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6333-00000116"/>
               <p>"Servants don't often mind showing-up what little they know," said Delphine,
                  haughtily.</p>
               <p>"When will you learn to treat Effie as you should?" said Winnie, as she kissed her
                  friend's burning cheek.</p>
               <p>"Grils," said Effie, "will you sit down upon these rocks and hear my story?"</p>
               <p>Her eyes were humid, and her voice faltered.</p>
               <p>"O, certainly we'll hear it, if you have anything to tell," said Augusta.</p>
               <p>"Two years ago, when my mother was alive, and I and my two brothers were her pride
                  and joy, we lived in a sweet, rustic, vine-clad cottage.</p>
               <p>"We were not wealthy, but we were what is better, comfortable and contented. My
                  mother had been left a widow when I as small, but had spared no pains to refine
                  and instruct me.</p>
               <p>"My brother Herbert <emph>loved</emph> his lessons; I thought that science was
                  useless. He profited by the example and instruction my mother was able to give;
                  but I, though I could not help learning many useful things, took but little
                  heart-interest in my studies. Times changed. We were expelled from our home by the
                  villainous acts of a man who was aided in his scheme by our country's laws.</p>
               <p>"We were homeless, and with the exception of some moveable property and a few
                  valuable family relies, we were penniless. We started with coarse but kind
                  companions to come to Oregon, where we were told, we would be able to regain more
                  than we had lost. We journeyed many miles and my mother who had toiled and
                  suffered and struggled for the benefit of her fatherless ones, was called to the
                  skies.</p>
               <p>"Girls, you all have living mothers. You know little about an orphan's loneliness.
                  Little brother Willie was also called away, and Herbert and I were left alone. We
                  journeyed on, and when we reached this 'Oregon City,' this goal which we had
                  struggled through so many privations to reach, we were without money, without
                  property, and without friends who were able to assist us. There was but one honest
                  way for me to earn a living. I must work, must hire out as a servant. For nearly
                  eighteen months I have toiled for food and clothing. My former neglect of lessons,
                  when the opportunity for further improvement was gone, appeared to me as almost
                  criminal, and I resolved to lay aside every penny I could spare, for the purpose
                  of defraying school expenses.</p>
               <p>"Yesterday, I received a letter from Herbert, stating that he is coming home with
                  plenty of funds for us to live upon. One thing I have to rejoice over. I have
                  learned to love and prize my studies and am going to live for some useful purpose.
                  I want, if again stricken by adversity or loss of friends, to be qualified to fill
                  some useful and worthy station. Here is a locket containing the miniatures of the
                  loved members of my family."</p>
               <p>There was not a dry eye among the assembled group of listeners, when the artless
                  narration was finished. Those who had been the mot sareastic and unfeeling towards
                  her, humbly asked forgiveness. Augusta and Delphine sobbed, and as they received
                  her kiss of forgiveness, their hearts were bowed in contrition. Their unkindness
                  had not been so much the result of ill-nature, as of thoughtlessness and
                  education.</p>
               <p>Effie Goodwin, the unfortunate, the persecuted, was now their firm friend, and
                  they tacitly acknowledged her as their superior.</p>
               <p>Two prize books, match volumes of Shakespeare and Byron, were to be awarded to the
                  writer of the best original composition, either poetry or prose. A committee of
                     the<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6333-00000117"/> most eminent Territorial
                  officials were to be the judges, and a spirit of competition ran high.</p>
               <p>Herbert reached the city in time to spend a month in the school before the grand
                  show of school-day genius was to come off, and judging from his weekly original
                  speeches, the Professor was confident that he would win the laurels. Time sped on,
                  and he morning of the exhibition had dawned. People flocked in crowds to the
                  Institute, evincing a laudable zeal in the great work of mental improvement.</p>
               <p>The competitors had given up their productions the week before, for the inspection
                  of the committee of critics, but none knew who was the successful aspirant. The
                  dignified Principal had deigned to tell his anxious scholars that the master-piece
                  would be the last one called for, but further than this, they knew nothing, and
                  when the reading time arrived, there were many fluttering, expectant hearts in the
                  assembly of excited students.</p>
               <p>Compositions bad, indifferent and good, were read by their respective authors, and
                  the sun was sinking low in the west, when "Herbert and Effie Goodwin," echoed
                  through the hall, Mr. Barton's most sonorous accents.</p>
               <p>Effie faltered and blushed, but was re-assured by a manly smile from Herbert, as
                  she accepted his proffered arm and mounted the stage.</p>
               <p>A dress of azure blue became her pearl-tinted complexion, and the oblique rays of
                  the sun as they penciled amber hues in her golden curls, ornamented by a simple
                  white rose-bud, so enhanced her ethereal beauty, that the audience fancied she
                  looked angelic.</p>
               <p>"Adversity and its Benefits," was the subject of her manuscript, and many were the
                  enconiums of praise lavished upon this her first triumphant public effort. She
                  read with remarkable ease and accuracy, and the gentle modulations of her
                  tremulous voice added power to the effect of her beautiful, philosophic reasoning.
                  The audience was pleased, astonished. And when informed at the close of the
                  exercises that the youthful writer had not been at school but two months in as
                  many years, they could scarcely credit the assertion.</p>
               <p>"Prosperity and its Pleasures," called out the Professor as soon as the hum of
                  applause and congratulation had subsided. If Effie had appeared ethereal, as she
                  stood upon the stage, Herbert, as he faced the audience with his manuscript held
                  carelessly in his hand, certainly had the appearance of a practical orator. He
                  scarcely glanced at the written pages, but the words seemed to come forth without
                  the slightest effort, as if they were the instantaneous creations of his own deep
                  mind, uttered without a previous thought. He had grown tall, and his manly figure
                  was displayed to good advantage in a modest suit of broadcloth. His face was
                  sun-burnt below the eyes, but the dark curls were thrown back from his marble
                  brow, stenciled with lines of thought; and his boyish face lost all juvenile
                  expression, as he became warmed and fired with the increasing interest of his
                  subject.</p>
               <p>"Who is to have the premium?" queried Mr. Barton, when the deafening applause
                  began to die away in distant echoes.</p>
               <p>"They're half an' half," exclaimed a stentorian voice at the door, which Herbert
                  and Effie thought was familiar.</p>
               <p>"Those of the audience who think Miss Goodwin's effort the most successful, will
                  please arise."</p>
               <p>"I say they're half an' half," repeated the same loud voice.</p>
               <p>No one arose. The same proposition was made in behalf of Herbert's composition,
                  but no one responded. Bartholomew Barton, A.M., was sorely puzzled. he knew how
                  they ought to vote, but could not frame his vocabulary into the proper phrases,
                  without some little reflection.</p>
               <p>"Tell them that thinks they're half an' half, to <emph>hist</emph>themselves<pb
                     n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6333-00000118"/> selves, an' see if there ain't a
                  commotion," vociferated the same outsider.</p>
               <p>"That's it," smiled one of the dignitaries, and the listeners, with one accord,
                  arose to their feet.</p>
               <p>"Will some one tell us what features of the two last compositions are superior to
                  many of the others?" said Mr. Barton, when they had resumed their seats.</p>
               <p>"Gracefulness of style and purity of sentiment, interfused with common sense in
                  the superlative degree, and a sincere way of speaking the truth with an
                  artlessness that is irresistible," answered a noted member of the bar, speaking
                  from impulse.</p>
               <p>"I half wish now that I had treated Effie more like a lady," whispered Mrs. Munson
                  to her husband. "But she is now in her native element, showing off her vaunted
                  beauty. She's nothing after all, but a medley of affectation and
                  impertinence."</p>
               <p>Nothing but envy, or the most bitter hatred, could have excited such a remark.</p>
               <p>There was to be a musical entertainment in the evening, and the exhibition
                  adjourned until seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>"Halloa, 'Erbert."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Captain Gray!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"It's <emph>me,</emph> that's a fact. Sure as fallin' off of a log."</p>
               <p>"When did you come to the city?"</p>
               <p>"I happened along to-day, an' hearn what was goin' on, an' thought I'd come and
                  see the performance. I allers thought ye'd make a mark in the world, but I didn't
                  expect ye'd begin this soon."</p>
               <p>"I did not expect it myself; but most of the students are so averse to writing
                  compositions, that it requires no great effort to outdo them."</p>
               <p>"I thought ye was in the mines."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>was</emph> in the mines, but I raised the wind, and am going to raise my
                  knowledge box while I have the needful."</p>
               <p>"That's the right kind of grit, my boy; the right kind of grit. Effy's up with ye
                  in smartness, if she is of the female persuasion.</p>
               <p>"I'm proud of her," said the brother, fondly, as he turned from his backwoods
                  friend to watch her fluttering movements among the congratulating throng of
                  ladies.</p>
               <p>"Well ye may be proud of her, for she's pretty as she's smart. She's ahead of
                  anything I've seen for many a day. That's so."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Captain Gray. How are your folks prospering?"</p>
               <p>"They'e alive an' kickin'. They took in a heavy dose in the way of dinner
                  yesterday. 'I guess they'll make the riffle."</p>
               <p>"How do you like farming here, in comparison with farm life in Illinois?"</p>
               <p>"Well, it's about after the same old sort. That is since I got my land open. I
                  don't have to feed the stock much in the winter, and that's <emph>some</emph> of
                  an advantage in my eye. My constitution can bear a good deal of ease, though old
                  Gray's a regular snorter to work when his hand's in. My old woman can make more
                  money than I can, though—off of her cows and chickens. I brought a load of her
                  fixtures—butter an' eggs, an' the like—to market to-day, an' the money I got for
                  'em is enough to make a Sucker's eyes 'bug out.'"</p>
               <p>"I am sorry I cannot invite you to my lodgings, butt I board with my sister, at
                  the house of a private family, who are already crowded with company. If you will
                  put up at the—Hotel, I will foot the bill, and breakfast with you in the
                  morning."</p>
               <p>"I'm much obleeged, but I've looked out for the campin' privileges. My wagon has a
                  good kiver, an' my bucket is chuck full o' <emph>muck-o-muck.</emph>"</p>
               <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6333-00000119"/>
               <p>"Do <emph>you</emph> talk the <emph>Jargon,</emph> Captain?"</p>
               <p>"Not of'en. Once in a while I slip out a word of the miserable stuff. I've hearn
                  it till it comes handy an 'natural like."</p>
               <p>"I'll see you again in the evening, Captain," and Herbert stepped up to his
                  sister's side, as she passed out of the doorway. Farmer Gray greeted her with a
                  cordial hand shake, and walked away, muttering to himself, "I wonder what's come
                  over that boy? He wouldn't talk about <emph>any</emph> one thing a half a minute
                  at a time. I don't see no use in his bein' in sich a pesky hurry."</p>
               <p>The evening entertainment was a success. The piano and melodeon were skillfully
                  played by Winnie Holmes and Augusta Howard; and a flute and guitar were agreeable
                  accompaniments in the practised power of two young gentlemen, who had been
                  students at the Institute from its infancy.</p>
               <p>Our friends were almost wholly unacquainted with instrumental music, but their
                  skill as vocalists won the most uprorious applause. Herbert's deep-toned bass,
                  responding to the liquid tones of Effie's modulated treble, produced an effect at
                  once pleasing and sublime.</p>
               <p>They had arranged a piece of manuscript music, to be sung at the close of the
                  evening's entertainment, and while Winnie throbbed the accompaniments with
                  pleasing skill, they say alternately, the heart-felt words of their own
                  composition: <q>

               <p>They withdrew from the stage amid a grand outpouring of music from piano,
                  melodeon, flute and guitar; and the applause, earnest, though subdued, from the
                  audience, told the brother and sister that sympathy had pervaded the breasts of
                  their attentive listeners.</p>
               <p>The moonlight was stealing through the shutters of Effie's chamber window, and
                  breaking across her bed in irregular pencilings of gold and amber, when she
                  entered her room to seek repose. She was excited and wearied with the incessant
                  duties of the day, so new, and unusual to her, and without disrobing, she sat down
                  to meditate. She remained motionless until her thoughts grew calm, when she arose
                  and knelt, throwing her whole spirit into a fervent out-pouring of thanksgiving to
                  Him who is ready and willing to hearken to the most humble petition. She earnestly
                  sought forgiveness for hidden sins, and prayed with childlike confidence to be
                  kept from guile. <q>

               <p>A month's vacation was a season of delight to the successful students. Winnie gave
                  a splendid party in honor of her guests, and those who had done most to make them
                  feel their degredation as servants, were most anxious to win their notice, now
                  that their place in the first society was securely established. Effie kindly
                  forgave them for past offences, but Herbert did not like to notice those who had
                  slighted his sister in adversity.</p>
               <p>"I'm sure, brother, that we're so happy now, we ought to overlook past neglect.
                  Just so long as we refuse to forgive and forget the insults of the past, just so
                  long will we have painful remembrances, which we had better consign to
                  oblivion."</p>
               <p>"Well, I'll treat offences as graciously as possible, but I'll arm myself with
                  unmistakable condescension, when I am thrown into the company of Augusta or
                  Delphine."</p>
               <p>And he kept his word. No cunning devices, or, as he said, "Evil machinations" of
                  theirs, could draw from him more than a condescending bow or sarcastic smile.</p>
               <p>"Delphine, I told you that you'd he half crazy about Effie's brother and his
                  'pocket full of rocks,' and my prophecy is fulfilled," said Eliza Crandall.</p>
               <p>"When I need any one to point out my designs or aspirations. I'll employ somebody
                  who is competent. You're jealous, and can't be a disinterested witness."</p>
               <p>"I might be jealous if my fancy didn't run in another direction. That being the
                  case, I don't plead guilty, and I'm sure you can't prove your assertions. Don't
                  you wish <emph>you</emph> could say as much in regard to your sentiments?"</p>
               <p>The measured chimes of the Institute bell stopped the retort tort that was forming
                  upon Delphine's tongue, and Eliza, as she took a seat by Effie's side, glanced at
                  her baffled schoolmate with such a look of mischief, that Mr. Barton was summoned
                  to reprove her. The examination of his mischievous pupil, called forth such
                  ludicrously comic answers, spoken with such apparent seriousness, that he was
                  compelled to lay aside his dignity long enough to laugh, though he speedily
                  recovered his haughty mien, saying something rather unintelligible about contempt
                  of authority.</p>
               <p>"Will you make respectful acknowledgements to Miss Howard?"</p>
               <p>"Most certainly, I am anxious to do so."</p>
               <p>"Very well, let's hear you."</p>
               <p>"Miss Delphine Howard," turning to her with mock-seriousness, "I am very sorry
                  that your very contemptible conduct has merited Herbert Goodwin's displeasure, and
                  to prove my sincerity, willingly proclaim this to our respectable school. Please
                  accept my commiseration and I will be your friend, in due respect to your father's
                  valuable possessions. Such measure as you give to others, should be given you in
                  return. I humbly ask your pardon for any good opinion I may heretofore have
                  entertained of you, aside from your father's property, and assure you I shall not
                  again be so inconsiderate."</p>
               <p>A genera laugh followed, which the worthy dignitary could not suppress for full
                  fifteen minutes.</p>
               <p>"Miss Eliza, you are required to commit to memory the entire rules of Davies'
                  Algebra, apart from your other studies, within the coming forthight, on pain and
                  peril of excommunication!"</p>
               <p>The Professor well knew that this was the worst punishment he could inflict, for
                  though she possessed uncommon shrewdness and great memory, she was averse to
                  learning anything requiring a little decisive effort. She had mastered<pb
                     n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6333-00000121"/> ed all the problems of said Algebra,
                  but her teachers knew that what she had learned had made no lasting impression. To
                  "begin at the beginning," and learn such "mopy rules," as she styled them, was a
                  task to her restless mind, but she would not say so, lest Delphine should rejoice
                  over her punishment. She was mistress of the rules within a week, and recited them
                  with a triumphant air. She said afterwards, in Mr. Barton's hearing, that "she
                  believed she'd insult <emph>Augusta</emph> next time. She deserved it as much as
                  Delphine did."</p>
               <p>"But the punishment," suggested Winnie.</p>
               <p>"O, it's such a benefit, I believe I'd like another dose."</p>

               <p>READER, as we wish to give you a general idea of the different classes of
                  Oregonians, we propose to take you to a mountain home, where lives the proprietor
                  of a section claim, and as much more virgin soil as his cattle desire to feed upon
                  or roam over. A corral inclosing an area of about four acres, is the first object
                  to be seen that denotes civilization, as we wind through the labyrinthine paths of
                  a tall, dark, fir and pine forest that fronts the dwelling. A bevy of hounds, kept
                  by the lord of the wilderness to assist in the chase, comes to meet us as we
                  approach the little cabin, which appears at the termination of the hilly clearing,
                  half hidden by blackened log-heaps, awaiting the driest season for a general
                  bon-fire. A garden through which the limpid waters of a gurgling spring are
                  coursing their gleeful way, peeps out from the huge, black stumps, revealing
                  mammoth vegetables.</p>
               <p>A vining rose-bush and the immortal wood-bine creep over the gable ends of the
                  cabin, showing that even in this rude domicil some tasty hand has been at work
                  transforming the homely, projecting logs into a beauteous bower.</p>
               <p>Gustavus Willard "used to be" a man of some pretension to taste, but he had money
                  with which he purchased a large band of emigrant cattle at very low rates, at the
                  Dalles of the Columbia. He remained there with his worn out stock until the fall
                  rains renewed the grass, enabling his slowly recruiting band to endure the journey
                  down the pack trail. He settled at the foot of the mountains, and extended his
                  claim into the beautiful valley, while the inexhaustible range of the mountains,
                  afforded abundant food for his rapidly increasing herds.</p>
               <p>Gustavus Willard soon found himself immensely rich. But as the rapid accumulation
                  of property too of the increases a desire for more, he became eager to hold more
                  of the valley prairie than as a bachelor, he was entitled to claim.</p>
               <p>Gustavus Willard must have a wife. That was settled. If he couldn't get
                     <emph>somebody,</emph> he must take <emph>nobody,</emph> or her sister. A
                  squatter lived about three miles from our bachelor's <hi rend="i"/>ranche. He had
                  a daughter thirteen years of age, "verdant" as the grass she trod; more
                  thoughtless than the cows she milked. Our bachelor called at the residence of the
                  mountain lassie. He thought she wasn't much like the dark-eyed niece who kept
                  house for him at his <hi rend="i"/>ranche, neither did she suit his fancy like
                  Fanny Waters, who wouldn't have him.</p>
               <p>"But then," he mused, "she'll hold that splendid half section of land in the
                  bottom, if I'll marry her, and I can't think of giving it up. I'll be compelled
                  to, though, by next December, if I don't marry somebody."</p>
               <p>So the affair was settled. And the big-footed, huge-fisted<pb n="242-243"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000122"/> mountain child became Mrs. Willard, and was
                  installed in the bridegroom's shanty as Florence's aunt!</p>
               <p>Now, reader, you have an idea about Mrs. Willard, so, if you are ready, we will
                  continue our imaginary journey to her residence, looking out all the while for the
                  dogs. Within the cabin is a strange medley of refinement and awkwardness, showing
                  that a difference of opinion about housekeeping is predominant. A baby is
                  squalling vigorously in the little back kitchen, and a child of thirteen months is
                  following suit in the front room. A dignified young lady, tall, graceful, pretty
                  and fascinating, plays the agreeable with us while Mr. Willard is endeavoring to
                  soothe the noisy children. We turn involuntarily to a long shelf of books, where
                  the young lady was engaged in reading when we first entered Some richly bound
                  poetical works, a family Bible Dick's works and Scott's Comentaries, look
                  suggestively out of place in this rustic cabin—not half so well built or
                  convenient as Farmer Gray's first pioneer shanty.</p>
               <p>Florence Willard, Herbert's ideal of maidenly loveliness, is before us. The same
                  dark eyes, raven curls and marble brow; the same pleasing expression, in spite of
                  a tinge of sadness visible in the curling lip and tinted cheek, showing that hers
                  is a life of every day disappointment that made her charming as a child, and
                  render her fascinating as a woman.</p>
               <p>"Are you satisfied with life in the wilderness?" we ask. The proud lip curls and
                  an indignant glance of pity and contempt at her aunt, shows better than words can
                  express it, how ardently she longs to be released from her monotonous mode of
                  existence.</p>
               <p>"I try to be contented, but cannot say that I succeed, My studies will be
                  completed under my uncle in another year, and then I shall seek society."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Willard is a short, clumsy little creature; a mere child, whose trials and
                  duties as a mother and housekeeper, have blanched her check and worn the flesh
                  from her short, broad frame. Her dress is soiled, and though evidently made by the
                  hand of the niece, is shabbily arranged upon her very slovenly figure. Her
                  children, one not a year older than the other, are noisy and dirty. The mother has
                  too much butter and cheese to take care of, to afford time to keep them clean,
                  even if she knew how; and Florence long since ceased to care for them, for she is
                  discouraged.</p>
               <p>Here comes Mr. Willard home to his supper. A half dozen men are with him, all
                  riding India ponies. They have driven up the enormous band of cattle, and <hi
                     rend="i"/>corraled them for the night. A multitude of calves, fifty or more in
                  number, are bawling piteously in the pasture that joins the <hi rend="i"/>corral.
                  Notwithstanding the backwoods life her uncle leads, and the uncouth surroundings
                  of his wildwood home, Florence respects many of his attainments. In spite of his
                  hickory shirt, buckskin pants, and cowhide boots, he appears dignified and
                  courteous, and as we get into conversation with him, we are surprised at his
                  general knowledge. He takes several Territorial, and a numerous collection of
                  States' papers, which are strung upon a line in the chimney corner, making a
                  formidable looking pile. We ask why he doesn't live in society? He answers that
                  his immense herds prevent him from living in a settlement. Echo answers that he's
                  a man of good sense in most things, and knows his wife would be a constant source
                  of mortification to him, among civilized people. Say it reader. Say what you
                  think. He deserves his banishment. Of what use to him is his extra half section of
                  land? Has he not paid dearly for his bargain? "Beter is a dry morsel and quietness
                  therewith,"—or we'll drop that quotation, and give you another yet more to the
                  point. "There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is that maketh
                  himself poor, yet hath great riches."</p>
               <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6333-00000123"/>
               <p>Mrs. Willard says it's "milkin' time," and as Florence is tying on her bonnet to
                  assist in that important vocation, we will bid them adieu, with the intention of
                  visiting them again in a subsequent chapter.</p>

               <p>Six and a half years since Maurice Stanton took possession of his claim, Ada and
                  Maurice were sitting in the verandah, watching the playful acts of two lovely
                  children, prototypes of their parents, who were playing upon the lawn, delighting
                  pa' and ma' with their playful, artless prattle and innocent pranks.</p>
               <p>"Maurice, don't you think we ought to receive a letter from your father this mail?
                  It's three months since you addressed him, and you requested him so particularly
                  to come and live with us, that I think he ought to condescend to write, if he
                  won't honor us with his presence."</p>
               <p>"There goes the post-boy, now. I guress I'll reide down to the post-office, it's
                  States' mail day, and we'll get an armfull of papers and magazines, if we don't
                  get letters."</p>
               <p>"Maurice had sold half of his land, and the other half was now inclosed by
                  substantial rail fences, behind the most of which, the osage-orange was slowly,
                  but surely growing up. An orchard, covering many acres, was loaded with blossoms
                  of every variety of fruit, common to this genial clime. The delicious fragrance of
                  the beauteous flowers, beaded with sweet, spring rain-drops, made Ada almost wish
                  that the fruit would delay its visit, so that she could longer enjoy the welcome
                  season of bloom. Instead of a log cabin in the glen, a showy white house adorned
                  the hill side, peeping out from a mass of oaken foliage, like a stately palace
                  from a lovely park. The house was not all thoroughly furnished, the main luxuries
                  consisting of carpets and curtains, but Ada told her friends rather
                  confidentially, that the next fall crop of fruit would purchase the remainder of
                  the furniture.</p>
               <p>"A letter with the Cincinnatti post-mark!" she exclaimed as Maurice handed her a
                  torn envelope. He still held the letter in his hand.</p>
               <p>"Here, read it, pet," he said, as he saw that she was—if possible—more anxious
                  than himself to know the contents.</p>
               <p>"That letter is just like tho old gentleman. Sounds just like he converses, when
                  he's pleased," Maurice remarked when she had finished.</p>
               <p>"O, I'm so glad he's coming to Oregon! He would have done so long ago, perhaps, if
                  you had invited him."</p>
               <p>"I didn't invite him till I wanted him to come. He would have scolded me so
                  unmercifully for being so foolish as to get married without money, that I really
                  didn't care about seeing him."</p>
               <p>"He says he'll be here by the latter part of May. Strawberries will then be in
                  their prime. Won't we give him our wild strawberries with cream this spring, and
                  currant jelly and blackberry pies this summer, till he's satisfied to live without
                  pork?"</p>
               <p>"Why, Ada! I must say, you act more like a girl of fifteen, than a matron of
                  twenty-four. And that isn't all either," he added, patting her cheek and stealing
                  a kiss.</p>
               <pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6333-00000124"/>
               <p>"What, now, Mr. Criticism? Let's hear it."</p>
               <p>"Why, you look more like a girl of seventeen, than a wife of almost seven years.
                  You really appear more girlish now, than when we were married."</p>
               <p>"And you think that stately father of yours will think me extremely childish.
                  Isn't that it? Come, own up!" she exclaimed, springing into his lap and returning
                  his kiss with an air which showed that she was not very seriously concerned about
                  his father's opinion.</p>
               <p>"No; I didn't think of that, but I was thinking that the doctor would think you
                  had been well cared for."</p>
               <p>"Haven't I been 'well cared for?'"</p>
               <p>"I guess so. But here come the children. Flora, come to papa. By-the-way, pet, I
                  heard of Florence Willard today," and Maurice gazed into the sparkling orbs of his
                  little one, with a pride and fondness such as the childless (Heaven pity them),
                  know not how to appreciate.</p>
               <p>"I saw Hugh Waters at the landing," he continued, "and he told me that she had
                  been attending the academy at Portland, for some time. She is studying music."</p>
               <p>"How much our Flora resembles her? I'll have to write this news to Herbert
                  Goodwin. But where has she been all this time?"</p>
               <p>"She lived with her uncle Willard in the Cascade mountains until last New
                  Year's."</p>
               <p>"How time flies? Herbert is now a man, and it seems but a few days since he fell
                  so desperately in love with that vision on the Plains."</p>
               <p>"I heard also, that Herbert and Effie are going to graduate this summer. Effie has
                  out-learned all of her schoolmates and shared the premiums at every
                  exhibition."</p>
               <p>"I'm glad to hear of their success. The future appeared gloomy before them, when I
                  saw them last."</p>
               <p>"Suppose we attend the coming June exhibition at the Institute stitute. We've
                  stayed at home so faithfully, that it's time to think about a little recreation.
                  We can hail the Valley Bird on her downward trip, and return almost any day."</p>
               <p>"Very well, we'll think about it."</p>
               <p>Night was coming on and Ada's little boy was fretting for his usual evening's
                  attention. How noble she looked, as she took the little child into her arms and
                  sunk into a richly cushioned chair, before the newly kindled parlor fire. Little
                  Henry, named for his maternal grandfather, was a rosy-cheeked, pleasing little
                  fellow, about eighteen months old. He had learned to talk, and lisped forth his
                  innocent prattle in a playful manner. His chintz robe was soon exchanged for a
                  snowy gown, from which his plump bare feet were peeping forth, while his hands
                  were fondly stroking his mother's face and hair. His play finally became
                  wearisome, and the head, adorned by chestnut waves of silken hair, fell back upon
                  his mother's arm. Ada looked fondly at his beautiful features and began to sing a
                  murmuring lullaby. <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"Write them childless! those cold hearted,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The child's breathing became measured, indicating the reign of sleep. She pressed
                  him fondly to her bosom as she ascended the stairway, and entering her chamber,
                  she resigned the sleeping babe to his place in the crib beside his sister, who had
                  learned, before he was born, to fall asleep without being nursed. When Ada
                  returned to the parlor, the flickering blaze of the fire had warmed itself into a
                  ruddy heat, and she sat down with a thoughtful air and gazed abstractedly among
                  the burning coals. But her meditation was speedily interrupted. The couches had
                  been late about<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6333-00000125"/> coming home, and
                  Maurice had just entered the dairy with two foaming pails full of milk. She took a
                  lighted candle, and proceeded to the dairy. A bubbling spring, breaking out from
                  the hill-side, was dammed up, so that the noisy waters could pass over an
                  elevation, forming a gleesome waterfall, which, coursing over the gravel floor of
                  the dairy, made a pleasant rivulet, two inches deep and twelve feet wide. The jars
                  and crocks, that were arranged in this cool streamlet, reminded the beholder of
                  countless varieties of the good things of life. Raise the covers, and you may find
                  golden butter, fresh eggs, tempting jellies and preserves, and a jar of the best
                  of icy cream, frozen by Ada's ingenuity. Ada donned her rubber boots, took her
                  skirts in one hand with a dexterity that daily practice had taught her, and moved
                  among the multitude of pans with a pleasant air.</p>
               <p>The milk was strained away to a wait its proper skimming time, and she waded out
                  of the dairy, east a contented glance at her handiwork, drew off her boots and
                  returned to the parlor. It was late before the married lovers retired from the
                  parlor, where music, reading, and affectionate conversation, beguiled away the
                  fleeting hours.</p>
               <p>When Ada entered her chamber, she paused at the crib, where her children were
                  sleeping: the sweet repose of childish innocence. With a mother's fondness, she
                  kissed each dimpled cheek, and knelt at the foot of the crib, to offer up fervent
                  petitions in their behalf. The silvery moonbeams escaped through the half closed
                  curtains, and radiated around the trio, fit emblems of peace and purity, love and
                  hope, contentment and joy. Maurice watched her for a moment, and then knelt beside
                  her, offering an inaudible petition, while Ada's gentle voice ascended on the
                  midnight zephyrs to the listening ear of the Infinite.</p>

               <head type="sub">FLORENCE IN SOCIETY.</head>
               <p>TWLIGHT had given place to dusky evening in the boudoir of a young lady, who was
                  listening to the sweetly trilled vesper of a solitary canary, caroling his song of
                  gladness in a gilded cage. In the hand of the fair one, was a letter which she had
                  read and re-read, with an interest that contrasted strangely with her usual
                  indifference. Her raven curls were thrown carelessly back, and a faultless
                  forehead rested upon the snowy palm of the right hand. A deep sigh escaped her.
                  "What <emph>shall</emph> I do? I, who have prided myself so much upon my
                  integrity, must now be viewed in the light of a heartless coquette!"</p>
               <p>The enchanting vespers of the tiny bird could not soothe her agitated feelings,
                  and finally, as if conscious that he had failed, he buried his head beneath his
                  golden wing and ceased his notes of happiness.</p>
               <p>Florence Willard had left the backwoods home of her uncle, who, in consideration
                  of her years of toil and dissatisfaction, who, in consideration of her years of
                  toil dissatisfaction at his house, had furnished her with spending money, and
                  place her under the tuition of a music teacher, in the metropolis of the
                  territory.</p>
               <p>Henry Warren, a young man of many sterling qualities, had solicited her had in
                  marriage. She had consented to give him her hand and thought her heart was to go
                  with it. For three months, this engagement had been acknowledged, but as she was
                  walking the streets, a few days before <emph>that letter</emph> was written, she
                  met Herbert Goodwin! The noble boy, who had inspired her soul with such deep
                  emotion years ago, when they both were but children, stood before her. For a
                  moment their eyes met, and the buried germ of affection, that had lain hidden in
                  their hearts, during long years of separation, budded suddenly into vigorous life.
                  Each stood glorified in the presence of the other, but the fair girls happiness
                  was of short duration.</p>
               <p>As if the cup of joy was worthless, its contents were poured into her heart only
                  to be misplaced or troubled to the depths, by thoughts that her heart and hand
                  were betrothed to another.</p>
               <p>It was enough for Herbert to know that he had seen her: had again beheld the ideal
                  of whom he had dreamed in boyhood, and whom he had sought since manhood, with the
                  energy of undying affection. The meeting was but for a moment, and they wended
                  their diverging ways through the thronging crowd in a day-dream of future
                  union.</p>
               <p>Herbert returned to Oregon City in the afternoon, told his sister who had met him,
                  shut himself up in his study, and addressed a long letter to Florence, copying
                  some verses at the close, which Effie had shown him in a popular magazine: <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>'I had a dream in boyhood: 'twas of one</l>

                        <l>It was a joy and beauty, and my heart,</l>

                        <l>Dreamed that any fate could bid it e'er depart,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"What <emph>shall</emph> I do?" were the words that again and again escaped the
                  maiden's lips, when for the fourth time she had carefully perused the sensible,
                  but passionate epistle.</p>
               <p>A servant entered. "Here ma'am, a gentleman sent up this here card. He says he's
                  waited a half hour for you and begins to think you ain't comin' at all."</p>
               <p>"Tell him I'll join him presently," she replied, as she glanced at the card, which
                  bore Henry Warren's name and signature.</p>
               <p>She pressed her hand upon her throbbing temples, and tried to calm her excited
                  thoughts. The servant's tread was again heard on the stairs, and she arose and
                  descended to the parlor.</p>
               <p>"My own Flora! You'll rival the goddess herself to-night at Flora's evening
                  Festival," said Mr. Warren as he advanced towards her.</p>
               <p>"Sit down, Henry, I have something to tell you," she replied with an effort.</p>
               <p>"We have no time now, dear. We're expected, you know, to play at the soirce
                  to-night, and must no be too late."</p>
               <p>"But I don't feel like going."</p>
               <p>"Why not?"</p>
               <p>"I would enjoy solitude much better than amusement tonight."</p>
               <p>"You'll go to please <emph>me,</emph> won't you, Flora?"</p>
               <p>"I will go," she said, hurriedly throwing a mantle around her shoulders, over
                  which the raven curls were twining, "but my hat's up stairs. I must go after
                  it."</p>
               <p>"Send Mary, and you talk to me," putting his hand upon the bell-rope.</p>
               <p>"She's busy, I can go," and she vanished through the hall.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter?" he mused, as he listened to her muffled tread upon the
                  carpeted stairs. "Perhaps she has some trouble that I ought to share. I ought to
                  have consented to spend the evening with her at home."</p>
               <p>The hat was placed jauntily upon the queenly head. Time was when she would have
                  peeped into the mirror, but <emph>this time</emph> she paid no regard to her
                  personal adornments. As if loth to quit the spot, she stood irresolute a moment,
                  then falling upon her knees, she prayed earnestly for direction and guidance from
                  on High.</p>
               <p>"You've re-appeared at last!" said her lover, rather petulantly, as they stepped
                  into the street. He tried to talk cheerfully, but the reserve with which Florence
                  armed herself, so unlike her former affability, east a spell of coldness over his
                  ardent feelings, and both felt relieved when the short walk was ended. A murmur of
                  admiration sounded through the crowded rooms, as they entered the gayly lighted
                  parlors.</p>
               <p>"O, I'm so glad you've come at last! exclaimed one of Florence's schoolmates, who
                  was to sing this evening for the first time before an assembly. Florence took her
                  seat at the piano, and played some intricate waltzes with admirable success. Fanny
                  Waters followed with a popular song, and Florence continued to play with increased
                  power and accuracy. Henry Warren stood behind her with his flute.</p>
               <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6333-00000128"/>
               <p>"How enchanting she looks!" exclaimed Hugh, the wild, but good-hearted brother of
                  Fanny Waters.</p>
               <p>"By Jove! if she don't shame Venus with her classic beauty. They say that Warren
                  has secured the prize, but I don't believe it."</p>
               <p>"But it is a certainty, that the waited upon her exclusively for the last three
                  months. He used to wait alternately upon all the girls in the city," replied
                  George Danvers.</p>
               <p>"I'll bet you an oyster supper that I'll introduce her to somebody who'll cut him
                  out."</p>
               <p>"Done!" said his friend with a smile.</p>
               <p>One person heard these jesting words with a thrill of disappointment. Herbert and
                  Effie had been invited to the soiree, and had come early to the house of Mrs.
                  Card, who had given the entertainment. Florence had not seen them, for, as they
                  were unacquainted with most of the company, they remained in the back-ground.</p>
               <p>Herbert's heart had beat wildly when Florence took her seat at the piano. Three
                  days had passed since he had had addressed her and he felt confident that she had
                  received his letter. One idea now clouded his anticipations, which had never
                  before crossed his mental vision. "Was she affianced?" He had seen a young
                  gentleman enter the room with her; had noticed that he dwelt upon her words, and
                  was exceedingly attentive to her performances. He mentally pronounced him homely
                  and unrefined, though most of henry Warren's city friends called him handsome and
                  interesting. His fine oval face was shaded by a luxuriant growth of dark brown
                  hair; his manner was engaging and his voice pleasant, but Herbert could see
                  nothing amiable, pleasing or intelligent about him.</p>
               <p>"You see through a glass darkly," said his sister affectionately, with a covert
                  meaning which he well understood, in reply to his expressed opinion.</p>
               <p>"What causes that fever-spot upon her cheek? he mused. Echo, from the caverns of
                  her heart, answered with a vague expression, which he happily construed into the
                  truth.</p>
               <p>She was excited, but was striving to still her agitated system by a desperate
                  effort to excel in the music with which she was engaged. A dress of gray silk,
                  trimmed with rows of black velvet ribbon, exposing the well-rounded shoulders,
                  where the glossy curls were thinnest, a simple black silk cord from which was
                  suspended a neatly wrought golden locket, falling a little below the waist and
                  secured at the termination of the corsage by a diamond pin, and a wreath of
                  natural flowers upon her brow, became her singular beauty and set off her natural
                  grace.</p>
               <p>"Why, Herbert Goodwin!" said Hugh Waters, as he espied him among crowd. I did not
                  know you were here. Are you acquainted with my sister and Miss Willard?"</p>
               <p>"I would be pleased to get an introduction," he replied, ingeniously contriving to
                  neither acknowledge or deny his former acquaintance with Florence.</p>
               <p>"I have heard that you once had a decided <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >penchant</foreign> for Miss Willard, but suppose that boyish dream long ago
                  vanished 'into thin air.'"</p>
               <p>"My sister is present. Perhaps she would like to become acquainted with your
                  friends," he said, not venturing to reply to his last remark.</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, Miss Goodwin; I had not discovered you. We will think that your
                  brother and yourself have come here for the sole purpose of taking items, if you
                  don't stir about a little occasionally."</p>
               <p>"Please request your sister and her friend to come to us. I don't like to go
                  through the crowd to the piano," said Effie, diffidently.</p>
               <p>"You needn't be ashamed of the sensation you'll create,"<pb n="256-257"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000129"/> he replied, with a roguish look of administration,
                  as he started after Florence and Fanny.</p>
               <p>He had become acquainted with our friends at the Institute a few years before. He
                  had left school with a somewhat superficial education, and they had met him but
                  seldom afterwards.</p>
               <p>Herbert's heart beat more wildly than ever, as he saw the object of his hopes and
                  fears approaching them.</p>
               <p>"Miss Willard and my sister; Miss and Mr. Goodwin," said Hugh.</p>
               <p>Florence bowed haughtily, but the struggle to subdue the fire in her heart, was
                  not sufficient to keep her self possession there. Her lips blanched, and for a
                  moment she hesitated. Effie was first to speak. "I believe we have met before,
                  Miss Willard; didn't we travel together a few days in the Umatilla Valley?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, remember, but I should have hardly known you."</p>
               <p>"Have I changed so <emph>much?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"You have changed but little in features, but I have always thought of you as the
                  little girl who chased little Indians along the Umatilla river. It seems strange
                  to see you grown."</p>
               <p>You have also changed, but it is my opinion that it has been for the better, and
                  that is saying a good deal for your present appearance."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Effie. You are the same little tease you always were," she answered,
                  with an effort to appear at ease.</p>
               <p>Herbert was talking in an extravagantly gay manner with Fanny Waters, who appeared
                  well pleased with his attentions.</p>
               <p>"Miss Floy," said Hugh, "I tell you what it is, I didn't fetch you here to
                  monopolize all Miss Effie's attention. I command you to seek other company, and
                  allow me my favorite seat."</p>
               <p>"Very well, if you're me master, I must obey."</p>
               <p>"O, you needn't get <emph>hostile</emph> over it. Here's Mr. Good win. He's good
                  enough in all conscience for you to associate with. I <emph>pick</emph> my
                  company."</p>
               <p>Playfully, "You're the personification of impudence. If I didn't know you so well,
                  I would consider your personalities most insulting. It isn't worth while for a
                  sensible person to get offended at you."</p>
               <p>"It would be like pouring water on a duck's back, if you should, Miss Gypsy."</p>
               <p>"Why, Hugh! You are certainly the most impolite jester I ever heard. I wouldn't
                  mind him, Floy. Fortunately he never means half he never means half he says," said
                  Fanny.</p>
               <p>How do <emph>you</emph> know, Puss? I'd advise you to tell what you know, not what
                  you conjecture."</p>
               <p>"And I'll follow your advice when I think it really necessary. But I am spoiling a
                  would-be quartette," and she cast a mischievous glance at Hugh, tripped away, and
                  was soon lost in the throng.</p>
               <p>Herbert had often laughed with his sister about the common-place conversations
                  concerning the "Plains," which is so often the theme in an Oregon or California
                  company, She was amused this evening by seeing that he talked to Florence of
                  nothing else, and thought that she would certainly consider him very prosy. She
                  knew where his heart was, and had a sisterly desire for his success, but thought
                  he was making a very poor beginning for a favorable impression. If she had known
                  the tumultuous feelings of both, she would have been spared these annoying
                  conjectures.</p>
               <p>Fanny went to Mrs. Card, the hostess, and asked her to request Herbert and Effie
                  to sing.</p>
               <p>Herbert's tongue was just beginning to get loose, and he thought he was playing
                  the agreeable to perfection, when a<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6333-00000130"/>
                  dozen calls for "Mr. Goodwin and his sister," put an imperative period to their
                  conversation.</p>
               <p>"I dread to sing before so many strangers," whispered Effie.</p>
               <p>"Don't say so, sister. You've succeeded admirably before greater companies than
                  this," and he offered Florence his arm, leaving Hugh to be his sister's
                  escort.</p>
               <p>"O, if Hubert were here!" Effie sighed, as they moved past the expectant company.
                  This sigh, for lonely years had heaved her breast in vain. And the soul-oppressing
                  reality of hope deferred, was beginning to fade her checks and wear out by degrees
                  her natural vivacity.</p>
               <p>"Here is a piece of original manuscript from the brain of one of our Oregon poets.
                  I received it from his hand a few days ago. Please to try your powers, vocal and
                  instrumental, upon one of our home productions," said? Hugh.</p>
               <p>"One would think you were sole manager from your manner of assuming authority,"
                  said Florence, with a quiet smile.</p>
               <p>"Aren't you going to sing? The listeners are becoming impatient," said Fanny. <q>

               <p>Herbert, Florence and Effie, joined in the vocal music, while the piano, under the
                  management of Fanny Waters, played a skillful and admirable part in the lively,
                  double quick time strains.</p>
               <p>"Come! Waters, own up! Who wrote that song?" said Danvers.</p>
               <p>"We <emph>must</emph> know," ejaculated a dozen voices.</p>
               <p>"Well, I'll tell you all that you have a right to know, or I have the privilege to
                  divulge. I am acquainted with a lady up the country, who designs to start an
                  Oregon Magazine. To effect this, she has opened an extensive correspondence with
                  Eastern publishers, and sending off a dozen or more letters every week; many of
                  them inclosing a ten cent stamp to pay return postage, has proved to be a heavy
                  tax. She is a lady of enterprise, and has been agitating this subject, until her
                  husband, in answer to a suggestion of hers about petitioning Congress to reduce
                  our mail expense, 'left off' this impromptu song, requesting her to circulate
                  it."</p>
               <p>"We are dying to know who they are," said one.</p>
               <p>"And who is this literary lady?" queried another.</p>
               <p>"When will her Magazine be issued?" asked a third.</p>
               <p>"Don't all speak at once," said Hugh, comically. I am not permitted to divulge her
                  name at present. You'll hear from her magazine in due time. Meanwhile, we hope you
                  ladies will practice the theory of this Oregon song. If you don't succeed while
                  Duck's in office, you'll stand a poor chance with a married man."</p>
               <p>"I noticed to-day, in the Tribune, that the Post-office Departments does not now
                  pay expenses. I'm afraid the ladies' petition will do but little good," remarked
                  Mr. Card.</p>
               <p>"I'm sure we don't want to beg anything," replied Hugh. Let them raise States'
                  postage two cents and reduce ours five, and there'll be some righteousness in the
                  system. Besides, the Department could then pay expenses, to say nothing of the
                  help such a measure would be to these remote countries."</p>
               <p>"I noticed in the Post," said Herbert, "that a motion to that effect has passed
                  the Lower House. I hope this matter will shortly be attended to."</p>
               <p>"I hope so," added Hugh. "But Fanny, It's time for us to go home. I promised
                  mother to see that your habits are temperate, and I am in duty bound to fulfill
                  the engagement."</p>
               <p>"Fanny, I'm afraid you'll never rightly appreciate the kindness of your protector,
                  till he's married and gone," said Florence.</p>
               <pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6333-00000132"/>
               <p>"I'm afraid I won't be able to appreciate it <emph>then,</emph>" was the smiling
                  reply.</p>
               <p>One by one, the company departed, until Florence and Henry Warren were the only
                  remaining guests besides Herbert and his sister, who were to remain at the house
                  of their obliging hostess for a few days. Florence lingered until Henry became
                  impatient.</p>
               <p>"Are you not going this evening, Flora?"</p>
               <p>"I will be ready in a moment. Excuse me, Miss Goodwin," and the dark-eyed beauty
                  left the room. Henry stood at the door, ready to accompany her, when she
                  reappeared, attired for the walk. She shook hands with Effie, and kissed her ruby
                  lips.</p>
               <p>"Can't you pass that round?" Herbert asked, attempting a playful speech.</p>
               <p>"Certaily, that is, the hand-shake, but I'm afraid my other half that is to be,
                  wouldn't like it, if he should hear that I had kissed you," and the snowy hand
                  rested in his. But she quickly withdrew it and turned away, nervously grasping
                  Henry's arm.</p>
               <p>"Can't you call upon my guests to-morrow?" asked Mrs. Card.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I will, after school."</p>
               <p>"'Tis a pity that out vacation have not occurred together; we might have had
                  several holidays," said Effie.</p>
               <p>"I don't wish to hurry yon, Flora, but I forgot my dead-latch key, and the office
                  will be looked up for the night in a few moments."</p>
               <p>"Once more, good night. I'm sorry, Henry, that I have kept you waiting."</p>
               <p>"What do you suppose the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">elite</foreign> of our city will
                  think of your actions to-night!" he asked, reproachfully, as they were in the
                  street.</p>
               <p>"If I have overstepped the bounds of propriety, none but a jealous eye could have
                  discovered the culminating point, that is certain!" she answered haughtily.</p>
               <p>"Do you accuse <emph>me</emph> of jealousy?"</p>
               <p>"I <emph>shall,</emph> if you find fault with my desire to keep congenial
                  company."</p>
               <p>He felt that he was going too far, and the tone of reproach changed to one of deep
                  affection. Their short walk was soon ended, but Florence had not dared to speak of
                  her tumultuous inner feelings. His manner had quelled her usual freedom of speech,
                  but she would not act deceitful. The prolonged, parting kiss was studiously
                  avoided by the upright girl.</p>
               <p>"I have found," she soliloquized, "that he was never designed to fathom the great
                  deep of my affections, and I'll acquaint him with the fact as speedily as
                  possible."</p>
               <p>"Good night, dear one."</p>
               <p>"Good night," coldly, and she vanished up the stairs.</p>
               <p>"Confound it all!" he muttered, as he walked rapidly away. "She's as fickle as the
                  rest of her sex! I know that this coldness is the beginning of a final
                  separation."</p>
               <p>Throughout the silent watches of the remainder of that desolate night, the
                  orphan's pillow was watered with scorching tears. Honor, so seldom found among the
                  belles of fashion, was her great ideal of perfection in a woman, but she felt
                  that, go which way she would, the thought of flirtation would destroy her
                  peace.</p>
               <p>"If I had told Henry of my childhood's fancy in the beginning, he would not blame
                  me so much. I thought that I had long ago ceased to care for Herbert, and
                  certainly believed that I should never see him again."</p>

               <head type="sub">MARTHA MARTIN.</head>
               <p>FLORENCE arose at dawn, unrefreshed and feverish, and sought the cool breezes of
                  the garden. A fountain there threw up its limpid waters in the bracing air,
                  falling again into a reservoir, from which they escaped and coursed away in a
                  noisy rivulet. She supposed that no one but herself was astir at that early hour,
                  and stood, gazing at the busy fountain, and leaning listlessly against the back of
                  one of the arbor seats; her hair thrown back and eyes cast down, while the
                  refreshing breeze played upon her fevered cheeks, and tossed her curls in every
                  direction over her head.</p>
               <p>She suddenly heard footsteps upon the pavement. Herbert and arisen with the larks,
                  and walking at a rapid pace through the city, trying to calm his walking at a
                  rapid pace through the city, trying to calm his nervous agitation, which he
                  considered foolish. Hearing the fountains gleeful play, he stopped involuntarily
                  to gaze upon its foaming waters. His eyes met Florence's startled look, and marked
                  the deep-hued flush that crimsoned her cheeks. He bowed and was trying to think of
                  something to say, when to his surprize she turned away and entered the house.</p>
               <p>"My tongue never fails to serve me in any one's presence but her!" he muttered, as
                  he continued his walk.</p>
               <p>Florence entered her room, sat down and addressed a long letter to her bethrothed;
                  informing him of her early attachment and unexpected meeting with Herbert.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"This unfortunate engagement has given me any amount of trouble for the two
                     past days. The art of flirtation, you know, I have never learned. I thought I
                     was to marry you and believed I loved you deeply, sincerely. Subsequent events
                     have sounded the shallow depths of my attachment. I shall ever love you as a
                     friend, but to know that the object of my dearest affection is still alive—that
                     he loves me with a sincerity only equaled by my regard for him,—and still
                     consent to fulfil an engagement that was, I thought, sincerely made, but now
                     repented,—would be doing you an injustice.</p>
                  <p>I hold that as one man was made for one woman, where the attachment is not
                     wholly reciprocal between the two persons, they had better seek further, or
                     remain unmarried, than to enter into a life-long engagement, which both may
                     repent when restitution is impossible.</p>
                  <p>"I do not now believe that you love me as you are capable of loving, and if you
                     will annul this engagement, you may one day be able to say to me, when we can
                     both laugh over the incidents of the past, that your attachment for me was but
                     a delusive dream, which, instead of strengthening with you strength, has
                     disappeared before the enchanting loveliness of a more congenial companion. I
                     consider you to be a gentleman of virtue and honor, and believe that you will
                     think more highly of me for having made this confession, than you would, if I
                     had fulfilled an engagement which both of us might have sincerely repented.
                     Wishing to remain upon terms of friendship with you, and desiring you to regard
                     me as a sister, I close this humble confession. Please answer at your earliest
                     convenience, for you know not the struggle my spirit 'is enduring.'"</p>
               </q>
               <p>The letter was dispatched to Mr. Warren's law office, in the care of one of the
                  children of the family with whom she resided. She longed to answer Herbert's
                  letter, but did not feel at liberty to do so until she should hear from Henry.</p>
               <p>After breakfast there was another leisure hour before school time, but Florence
                  could not be still, and to make the time pass more agreeably away, she proceeded
                  to the academy. Miss Martin, the music teacher was there before her, and the quiet
                  solitude she had hoped to find for an hour in the school room, must be sought
                  elsewhere. She bowed, and turned to go to the library, but Miss Martin detained
                  her.</p>
               <p>"You were at Mrs. Card's soiree, last night," she said, inquiringly.</p>
               <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6333-00000134"/>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>
               <p>"Did you become acquainted with Mr. Goodwin and his sister?"</p>
               <p>"I saw them there, but knew them on the Plains."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! I became acquainted with them there. They were but children when I saw
                  them, but I was deeply interested in them and their amiable mother."</p>
               <p>"Their mother was dead before I knew them."</p>
               <p>"Do they intend to remain long in the city?"</p>
               <p>"But a few days, I believe."</p>
               <p>"I must call at Mrs. Card's this afternoon. Would you like to accompany me?"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps; but there is one thing I want to talk to you about, as the only unbiased
                  person to whom I can go for counsel. If you are an old maid, your heart is kept
                  green as spring-time by the overflowing streams of kindness that cast a pleasing
                  spell upon all who are thrown in your company."</p>
               <p>Miss Martin smiled. "One would think you were growing exceedingly poetical over an
                  old maid's imaginary virtues. 'Old maid' I am and expect to remain, for I am
                  twenty-six, and the many dreams of my girlhood are only remembered as seasons of
                  past sunshine—their peculiar <emph>brightness</emph> goner for ever—yet the
                  reflection of by-gones radiates around me, and seems to grow brighter every
                  passing day. But what do you want to tell me, dear? We must finish our
                  conversation before we have listeners."</p>
               <p>Miss Martin put her arm affectionately around her pupil. Rain that had played in
                  the air in a misty spray since sunrise, began to patter against the window panes.
                  Florence leaned her head upon her teacher's breast, and told the story of her
                  engagement and its consequences. She showed the letter that Herbert had written,
                  and asked her for counsel, as a child might seek advice from a judicious
                  parent.</p>
               <p>"You are doing right, my dear. The only thing in which you are to blame, is, that
                  you did not tell Mr. Warren, from the first, of your early fancy."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>intended</emph> to have told him, but somehow I never could speak of it
                  at the proper time, and kept putting it off to a future period, until we were
                  engaged."</p>
               <p>"Learn from this experience, my dear girl, not to withhold from your lover any
                  thoughts which trouble you. You may think there are crosses which you can bear
                  alone, but—when your vows of union for life are exchanged with your chosen
                  one—there should be no solitary bearing of heart troubles in which your lover, as
                  your husband, should not share and alleviate. Suppose now, that Herbert had been,
                  as you supposed him, dead, or gone for ever from your sight. You saw, or thought
                  you saw in Henry Warren, a man whom you could love and honor. Had you informed him
                  of your early preference, no jealousy would have been awakened in his breast, had
                  he been worthy of you; but he would have thought, and truly, that one so faithful
                  to the memory of the departed, would prove an equally faithful wife to the
                  living.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>My</emph> experience was dearly bought dear Floy. I pray God that you may
                  never be tried as I never been."</p>
               <p>"Do please tell me about it," said Florence, her black eyes glistening with the
                  interest she felt in her beloved teacher. "You needn't be afraid to trust
                     <emph>me.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I was left an orphan at an early age, and my lot was cast in the society of a
                  paternal aunt, who, though mindful of my temporal wants, never condescended to
                  notice my <emph>whims,</emph> as she regarded my rather peculiar notions of almost
                  everything. I grew up within myself; felt that I had no congenial friends, and
                  thought I cared for no one, not even myself. Two years before we started to this
                  country, I became acquainted with Mrs. Mays, a sister of my uncle's, to whose
                  kindly regard, I owe all that I am or ever may be that is good and trust<pb
                     n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6333-00000135"/> worthy. But she perished upon the
                  Plains, and again I was mentally alone. Yet not alone, for she had taught me to
                  look beyond the confines of this little world for happiness and rest. When I was
                  sixteen years old, I met and loved Willis Stokes. We were not engaged, but each
                  read the other's heart, and looked forward to years of mutual enjoyment. Business
                  called him to a distant State. I received letters from him occasionally for a few
                  months, but my aunt would not allow me to answer them, and he finally ceased to
                  write. I blamed him for neglecting me, and with a desperate effort to spite him, I
                  began a flirtation with his cousin, knowing that he would get to hear of it, and
                  suffered the report of my engagement with George Stokes to go forth
                  uncontradicted. A year passed and Willis returned. I had never told him about aunt
                  Mays' pious horror of love letters, and he did not visit me—as I afterwards
                  learned—because he was offended about my neglect. Had he known the restraint under
                  which I was kept at home, he would not have blamed me, but I thought he had
                  troubles enough of his own, and kept my grievances from him. George told him that
                  we were engaged and he departed without meeting me. It will be ten years this
                  evening since I last beheld his face. We were standing under the great elms, in
                  the avenue fronting my uncle's home. He told me that he was going, and requested
                  me to enter with him into a solemn promise of marriage. I gave him my hand and was
                  trying to speak, when a spiteful call from my aunt disturbed me. I often wonder
                  how she ever happened to be married. Certain it is that she looks upon the act as
                  something criminal in other folks. I hurried away, merely saying a hasty goodbye.
                  The next morning he took passage in the cars for a distant city, and these letters
                  are the only mementoes left me of my heart's young dream."</p>
               <p>"What became of George?"</p>
               <p>"He married an excellent girl, and is now living in my uncle's Eastern homestead.
                  He tried to find Willis, after he became aware of my preference, but was
                  unsuccessful in his search. He may not be living, but whether he is or not, the
                  Infinite knoweth."</p>
               <p>"Do you believe that Christians who truly love in life, and have perfect
                  affinities for each-other here, will meet in the world to come."</p>
               <p>"Most certainly. Aunt Mays quotes 'They neither marry nor are given in marriage,'
                  as her proof of an opposite theory. I freely admit the force of that clause of
                  Divine Inspiration, but my reason for it s this: Our Master says nothing without
                  cause. The world of happiness is so much more perfect than this, (and we will not
                  have the clog of mortality to obscure our mental vision,) that each can read the
                  thoughts of the other's second self, and the attraction will be mutual and
                  instantaneous. 'No marrying or giving in marriage.' will be necessary, for we will
                  possess the intuitive knowledge of 'the angels of God in Heaven.'"</p>
               <p>"Don't you ever expect to get married?"</p>
               <p>"Not unless I find that I can be a blessing to some one during life. A true
                  marriage is not for me, unless the first object of my regard should find me, which
                  is an improbability."</p>
               <p>Numerous voices of happy and dissatisfied girls were heard in the hall; the
                  driving rain having saturated their cloaks and hoods, making fine fun for a few
                  and grumbling discontent for many. Miss Martin replenished the fire in the stove,
                  and called the noisy group to order.</p>
               <p>Florence took her usual seat, and as she glanced at the plain, neat dress of her
                  teacher, and marked her subdued, but pleasant smiles, she wondered that she had
                  never thought her pretty before. She knew that she had taken to teaching on
                  account of reduced circumstances, and thought that the<pb n="270-271"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000136"/> faint lines of sorrow, dimly visible about the
                  mouth and eyes, resulted from pecuniary disappointment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mays, her uncle, had become insolvent after several years of ineffectual
                  gold-hunting and other speculations, and Martha, rather than be a burden on his
                  hands, had accepted her present situation. She was styled "old maid," and "maiden
                  aunty," by all of the girls, whenever her back was turned, but Florence now
                  thought that if they could hear her story as she had heard it, they would speak
                  derisively of her no more.</p>
               <p>"I wonder," she thought "if all 'old maids' have so great a cause for continuing
                  in 'single-blessedness,' as she has? She wouldn't be called 'old maid' anywhere
                  but in Oregon. Most girls here, think they must be married before they're fifteen,
                  or they'll be doomed to irremediable spinsterhood. I guess too, they have been
                  affected to some extent with the mania that has infested the bachelors. They used
                  to marry to hold their land. I for one, am not sorry that the Land Act has
                  expired."</p>
               <p>"Herbert and Effie were sitting in a bay window of one of Mrs. Card's parlors.
                  Effie had become absorbed in Dombey and Son, while Herbert was trying in vain to
                  get interested in Bayard Taylor's Cyclopedia of Modern Travel, a book well suited
                  to his taste, and which at any other time would have engaged his entire attention.
                  Mrs. Card was superintending the dinner, and had left them alone for an hour.</p>
               <p>Herbert shut the volume with a nervous heavy stroke, that aroused his sister from
                  her abstracted dream over the printed page.</p>
               <p>"Effie do lay aside that book had talk to me! My head aches! How heavily time
                  drags along to-day."</p>
               <p>"I'm sorry to hear you complain of the tardiness of time, my dear brother. I was
                  just getting ready to have a hearty laugh at 'Mr. Toots.' Here lay your head on
                  the sofa pillow low, and I'll try my powers of mesmerism on your forehead. I guess
                  'the magnet in my fingers' as Dr. Muse calls it—can drive or allure the pain
                  away."</p>
               <p>"You are the dearest sister mortal ever had."</p>
               <p>"You're a successful flatterer. I believe I am the dearest sister <emph>you</emph>
                  ever had, if I admit it myself.</p>
               <p>"Are you jealous of Florence, sister, mine?"</p>
               <p>"What a question! I don't expect to occupy her place in your heart. I shall stick
                  most adhesively to my 'sister's corner'; I'm almost as deeply interested in your
                  success as you are."</p>
               <p>"Well, I'll have to confess that I felt a pang of jealousy when you first wrote me
                  about Hubert Munson."</p>
               <p>"He paused, for a shade of sadness which of late had often mantled his sister's
                  brow, had settled over her features.</p>
               <p>"How long since you received a letter from Hubert?"</p>
               <p>"Over four years."</p>
               <p>"Do you believe he has been false?"</p>
               <p>"I do not! I shall always believe his regard for me was all he expressed it to be.
                  He may be dead. I don't know. I have ventured to ask his father about him
                  sometimes, but he treats me so coldly when I speak of his son, that I never
                  persist until I get a satisfactory answer. If he lives he will return some day, if
                  not I can go to him."</p>
               <p>Herbert kissed her with a brother's fondness, and seeing that she grew sadder
                  still, he adroitly changed the subject.</p>
               <p>"Sister do you know who is the author of that song we immortalized last
                  evening?"</p>
               <p>"I can guess."</p>
               <p>"Who?"</p>
               <p>"No one who crossed the Plains with Maurice Stanton and listened to his songs,
                  could doubt his hand and headwork in that manuscript."</p>
               <p>"I wonder if Ada is going to be literary? If there are<pb n="272-273"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000137"/> women in Oregon who are capable of conducting a
                  periodical, I believe she is among the number."</p>
               <p>"Hugh Waters says that she is going to try to start a Magazine that will be
                  inferior to none in the Union. Won't she wake the Eastern critics, if she
                  describes Western life and incidents as they are? Tinged as she can tinge
                  them—with romance enough to make them readable and spice enough to attract
                  everybody's attention. I don't believe she'll be afraid of criticism, if she can
                  know that her writings are beneficial to the country. One thing certain, her
                  writings will all be of a moral nature."</p>
               <p>"Everything must have a beginning. She will probably be successful in time. But my
                  dear sister, I should hate to see you trust yourself upon so precarious an
                  enterprise."</p>
               <p>"I never expect to make the attempt—at least not in my own name. I may write
                  sometimes for publication, but I'll hide behind a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">nom de
                     plume,</foreign> which nobody but Ada can recognize. I should faint under the
                  blow of some self-conceited hypocrite, to say nothing of the well-meant
                  fault-findings that would certainly assail my most earnest efforts in the
                  newspapers and magazines, perpetrated by critics and editors whose long study and
                  final triumphant success have emboldened them to crush into disrepute the first
                  efforts of youthful genius: their bitings being the more bitter because they have
                  a remembrance of how and where they started."</p>
               <p>"Why sister! You must entertain a very uncharitable opinion of our press. I am
                  certain that the American public are generally very lenient towards youthful
                  writers.</p>
               <p>"You've turned your tune since you warned me against a certain 'precarious
                  enterprise,' a moment ago. I should consider you naturally very fickle, from your
                  remarks, if I couldn't account for it at present by your being in love."</p>
               <p>"The life of an authoress, though fascinating in its very excitement and danger to
                  some minds, would be a constant source of mortification to my sensitive plant.
                  This is why I cautioned you against it. But what do you expect to do with
                  yourself?"</p>
               <p>"I used to think I'd be mistress of a little cottage of my own, and live among
                  birds and flowers—as we did in Illinois—only on a grander scale; but life's future
                  is densely clouded now, and I don't know what course to pursue. We'll graduate in
                  June, and you'll of course get married: do some chivalrous deed for your country,
                  besides tilling the soil—writing scientific articles for the—Tribune; starting
                  benevolent societies: organizing and superintending Sunday shcools: repeating
                  numerous plagiarisms upon poems, when you get eloquent, and finally bringing up
                  boys and girls, with bright black eyes and raven curls."</p>
               <p>"Is that <emph>all,</emph> sister? He smiled at her vivid picture, but a shade of
                  doubt crossed his face.</p>
               <p>"O, you needn't look doubtful. I have the kaleidoscope that enables me to see
                  these things in your future. Haven't I told you of enough to do?"</p>
               <p>"I shall grow bald before I perform half the work that you have assigned me; and
                  as to getting married and 'bringing up the boys and girls,' though a truly
                  pleasant picture to contemplate, I thing its realization is <emph>very</emph>
                  uncertain."</p>
               <p>"Fie! Herbert. If I had no more hope than you have, I'd die of suspense."</p>
               <p>"'Love makes cowards of us all.'"</p>
               <p>"Don't call <emph>me</emph> a coward! I'm in as deep as you are and I'm as brave
                  as a crusty old bachelor who couldn't love if he should try."</p>
               <p>"Sister, darling! Tell me? Are you happy, or do you act this way to make me feel
                  at case about you? If you have hidden trouble, I, as your only relative, ought to
                  share it."</p>
               <p>She was sitting upon a footstool beside him, as he lay on<pb n="274-275"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000138"/> the sofa. He put his arm around her and drew her
                  head upon his breast, looking earnestly into her clear blue eyes.</p>
               <p>"My heart knows its own bitterness, my dear brother; I do not wish to add to your
                  manhood's cares by revealing my hidden troubles. Do you remember the sentiment of
                  our evening song that won its such applause, long ago: <q>

                  dark! But I do not repine. My motto is, and ever will be, 'look upon the brightest
                  side of every cloud.' There is much for me to do upon this little earth."</p>
               <p>The announcement of dinner interrupted the conversation.</p>
               <p>"Miss Martin has been teaching in the—Academy for some time past. She sent me a
                  note at noon, stating that she would call upon you, in company with Miss Willard,
                  this evening, after school," said Mrs. Card.</p>
               <p>"Miss Martha Martin? The prim young lady we saw in Platte river valley, whose
                  friend was dying, and whose clothing looked so spotlessly clean in contrast with
                  the soiled garments of other folks."</p>
               <p>"You have a strange medley of ideas, sister. One might consider death and clean
                  clothes to be twin sisters, from your way of speaking," said her brother with a
                  confused attempt at an affectionate smile, which, though is played around the
                  mouth, did not reach the eyes."</p>
               <p>"She merely stated in the note—here it is—that she had met you several years ago,
                  and would be pleased to renew the acquaintance," remarked their hostess.</p>
               <p>Henry Warren was sitting in his office, busily engaged in trying to untangle the
                  intricacies of a troublesome law suit, when the letter from Florence was placed in
                  his hand. He tore open the envelope with a vague apprehension that something was
                  wrong.</p>
               <p>"The conceited fop shall never know that I regret the turn matter have taken," he
                  exclaimed, and returned Florence's letter immediately, inclosing the following
                  note:</p>

                              expression a desire to annual this troublesome engagement. It is what
                              I would have asked last evening, but hadn't the heart to distress a
                              handsome maiden. In due appreciation of your honesty, honor, and
                              candor, I subscribe myself your friend and brother,</p>

               <p>He dispatched the note to the academy, sat down and tried to meditate. He pressed
                  his hand upon his throbbing temples, while a tremor ran through his frame.
                  Mortified vanity was his worst trouble, for he "had fallen in love, and out
                  again," until he could no longer realize or feel any tender emotions. But this was
                  the only instance in which the "falling out" had not been upon his side.</p>
               <p>"I'll make her believe that I never <emph>did</emph> love her."</p>
               <p>Common sense whispered that that was the very thing she most desired.</p>
               <p>"But she shall not have the gratification of counting me among her slain; that is
                  certain."</p>
               <p>"A note for Miss Willard," said Miss Martin, as she received the message from the
                  hand of Mr. Warren's errand boy, and advanced towards Florence's seat, saying in
                  an undertone, "I will this time omit one of my strictest rules, and permit you to
                  retire to the library, where you can read your note unobserved, without waiting
                  till the school closes."</p>
               <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6333-00000139"/>
               <p>Her tone and looks expressed a meaning which Florence understood. She had rightly
                  conjectured as to who was the author of the note, and knew how anxiously her pupil
                  was awaiting its arrival.</p>
               <p>"So much for making a confident of one's teacher," she thought, as she bowed a
                  respectful "thank you," and withdrew from the school-room.</p>
               <p>No feeling of wounded pride such as her betrothed had hoped to excite, rankled in
                  her breast.</p>
               <p>"He hasn't suffered after all," was the pleasing thought that filled her
                  unsuspicious mind.</p>
               <p>When she returned to the school-room, she placed the note in the hand of her
                  teacher. who hastily glanced at the contents and gave her pupil a smile of
                  satisfaction.</p>
               <p>The clouds disappeared in the afternoon, and the fresh spring rain drops beaded
                  every out-door object with myriads of diamonds. Effie was gazing through the
                  window, watching the motions of a pair of larks that were building in the grass,
                  where they thought they had found a secure hiding place, when she heard the gate
                  open.</p>
               <p>"Misses Willard and Martin are coming," she observed, as she left the window.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Card's brown eyes danced and sparkled with merriment, as she looked archly at
                  Herbert, who colored to the roots of his hair. He was conscious that she read his
                  secret, and could think of nothing to say. The call was a protracted and very
                  pleasant one. Florence had been under embarrassing restraint all through the
                  interview, and felt relieved when the proposal to "go" was made by her
                  teacher.</p>
               <p>When they stood upon the threshold, ready for departure afternoon had given place
                  to twilight.</p>
               <p>"With your permission, ladies, I shall be happy to accompany you to your homes,"
                  said Herbert confusedly. Florence ence nodded assent, and asked Effie to join them
                  in their walk.</p>
               <p>"Here is my home," said Miss Martin, when they reached the steps of a large
                  boarding house, two squares distant from Mrs. Card's residence. "Can't you go in
                  with me?" addressing Effie.</p>
               <p>"With your permission, brother, I will stop with Miss Martin until you return.
                  Now, don't keep me up till midnight, waiting for you, "she added playfully, as
                  they moved on.</p>
               <p>"Don't be alarmed about <emph>her</emph> Mr. Goodwin; I'll <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >chaperone</foreign> her to Mrs. Card's to-morrow morning," said Miss
                  Martin.</p>
               <p>Reader, we were not there, and can't tell you exactly what <emph>did</emph> pass
                  between the lovers, but certain it is, that before they had spent an hour alone.
                  Herbert was heard to ask her where she would like to live, and other questions
                  equally suggestive of a mutual agreement.</p>
               <p>"O, Herbert, <emph>do</emph> consent to go upon a farm! There are too many
                     <emph>smart folks</emph> in the world already. We can have a sweet little home,
                  peeping out from a grove of oaks, with green window blinds, and a trellised
                  portico. Then, in the country, everything looks so fresh and sweet. Such loves of
                  flowers! so many wild berries! such sweet, free birds! How much happier they must
                  be, than my little Lucien, who sings so sweetly from utter loneliness!"</p>
               <p>"You didn't become disgusted with farm life when in the mountains, I
                  perceive."</p>

               <p>"My 'reply' then is, that if my husband becomes discontented, I'll box his ears,"
                  suiting the action to the word, but so tenderly that he said, "the more such
                  'boxes' I receive, the better I shall be satisfied."</p>
               <p>"I can train you," and she looked archly into his eyes.</p>

                  the hour to twelve as he departed.</p>
               <p>"Miss Martin judged wisely, when she decided upon keeping sister over night," said
                  he to himself, as he descended the steps. "I have often said that I would never
                  keep late hours in a lady's company, and have broken my resolution, under the very
                  first temptation."</p>
               <p>A maiden who has retired to the solitude of her chamber in a flood of expectant
                  happiness, and a young man who walked the deserted streets towards a public

                  before, blooming in his breast, knew nothing of the struggle between mortified
                  vanity and selfish love that was rankling in the breast of the discarded

               <p>"In the autumn of 1850, we settled here, upon a section of land, (You know we

               <p>'My father-in-law, Dr. Stanton, arrived on the last steamer. He is a dignified,
                  aristocratic old gentleman, has but little to say to me, but is agreeable with the
                  children, who are very fond of him. Now that we do not need his help, he has come
                  to us and given all his possessions into our hands. Maurice would not keep them
                  for himself, but bequeathed all to Flora and Henry, except five thousand dollars,
                  with which he headed a subscription for erecting a church and seminary at Valley
                  Brook. He says if we were still poor, the doctor would not deign to help us, and
                  when we don't need his services we won't accept them. The doctor is a deep
                  scholar, and though we differ in many theories, I can learn much from his
                  conversation when he is in a communicative mood. He has consented to aid me in the
                  Magazine enterprise, and with his help and Maurice's I hope to succeed in what I
                  am designing soon to undertake.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Welden lives near Valley Brook, about a mile from here. You ought to see how
                  happy she is with her children. Celia is almost thirteen. Howard is a fine manly
                  boy of eleven; Lucy a lovely little creature of nine; but Johnny is the favorite
                  of the household. Mrs. Welden says that if her husband had lived to see their
                  children so noble, she would have few things now to trouble her. You remember the
                  black woman she met at Lagrange. She received a letter from her master, Mr.
                  Harris, a short time since, stating that she was dead, and that her last prayer
                  had been offered in behalf of 'little Miss Maggie.'</p>
               <p>"We have a Farmer Gray sort of neighborhood here; attend church regularly in the
                  log school-house, and have any amount of old fashioned singing-schools. The women,
                  generally speaking, care for nothing but making butter and cheese, and raising
                  chickens for market, besides making patch-work quilts, and 'goin' to meetin'.' the
                  men like horse-races, corn whiskey, big yarns and tobacco. They consider a select
                  few, ourselves among the number, as being very conventional, but we treat them
                  well, and if they don't fancy out mode of life, they have no reason to tell us so.
                  The girls and boys, from ten years old and upward, care for balls, backwoods'
                  play, parties, and getting married, more than for anything else. But schools are
                  multiplying, and society is growing better every year. I hope the rising
                  generation of youthful Oregonians will be an improvement upon the older frontier
                  stock. I look complacently at <emph>two</emph> specimens of the former, who will,
                  I hope, be exceptions to the general rule of women (?) who ought to be in
                  pantalettes, and men (?) who ought to be arrayed in checked aprons, and ciphering
                  in addition on the village black-board.</p>
               <p>"I suppose you are wondering if I am the same wild romp I used to be? I answer,
                  Yes! When all healthy out-door creatures cease to play and romp in their own way,
                  then I will sit down in the rocking chair, when not in bed, or over the
                  cook-stove, mop or wash-tub, and see if I can't be dull too. But while everything
                  animate rejoices, and all nature wears such smiling charms of loveliness, I shall
                  laugh, and ride horses, and jump ropes, and climb hills, no matter what prudish
                  matrons may say, or how much Mrs. Mays cautions Martha Martin to beware of my
                  conduct. Do you remember how we heard her telling her niece to never stoop to do
                  such a thing as that, after I had run a foot-race with little Billy Green? I would
                  not be unfeminine, but I would be <emph>healthy, active and happy.</emph> How sad
                  I sometimes feel, when I reflect upon the way that most American women live! No
                  wonder consumption and debility, and constant suffering are the common lot of so
                  many of the tried daughters of our glorious land!</p>
               <p>"Of the working class—farmers wives and washer-women—I rate them together, for
                  their hardships are equal; how many are overworked every day? Confined in the
                  house from morning till night, taking care of—I had like to have said scores
                  of—little children, and toiling for the comfort of inconsiderate men, who never
                  think of helping them, but who can say and impatiently enough, that it's no wonder
                  women are unhealthy, when they won't stir out and work in the<pb n="282-283"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000142"/> field.' Such men are all the rage in Oregon. How
                  can they expect their wives to perform the in-door labor of two or three healthy
                  women, and work out of doors in the bargain? We are not a healthy race like out
                  grandmothers were, but if we will work till our own feelings tell us we have done
                  enough, taking time enough for out-door exercise, while we have the strength left
                  to perform it, I know by experience that we can perform all necessary labors and
                  not die or droop from fatigue either. I am never sick, and I can perform more real
                  hard work than any of my neighbors can, who spend their time altogether in-doors.
                  I would not write these things to you, Birdie, but you are now marriageable, and I
                  want to caution you against those men who would not marry for other than purely
                  selfish motives. A little discrimination will teach you who they are.</p>
               <p>"I rode up to the house of one of my neighbors a few days since, a cadaverous,
                  ghastly looking woman, who has three children, the eldest but three years of age.
                  I asked her if she would like a ride?</p>
               <p>"'I'd like it well enough, but these pies ain't done, and that meat must be
                  roasted, and those towels washed, and there's not water up from the spring. I
                  don't believe I'm able to ride, anyhow.'</p>
               <p>"'Not able to ride—and at work like this?"</p>
               <p>"'Yes, we have four workmen, and Silas says that they must have good things to
                  eat. I couldn't leave the children, no how.'</p>
               <p>"I answered that I had had a pleasant ride, and if she would mount Flaxy, I would
                  carry on her work and mind her children, till she could return.</p>
               <p>"'Well, come in, and we'll see about it. But there's that quilt in the frames. I'm
                  obliged to have it in this room because I must keep the baby by the fire. Silas
                  says we've had to roll it up to make room to set the table, often enough. I
                  thought I'd see if I couldn't get it out of the way to-day,' and she straightened
                  her weary form, and pressed her dough-covered hand over her side, when she had
                  finished the last pie.</p>
               <p>"I dismounted, feeling refreshed and vigorous, from the effect of my morning ride,
                  drew off my gauntlets, threw my hat upon a bed and went to work. The woman looked
                  on in astonishment.</p>
               <p>"'Where upon earth do you leave your children?"</p>
               <p>"'Mr. Stanton takes them out in the fields, while I ride out. I sometimes take the
                  youngest with me, but they are both large enough now to follow him, and I
                     <emph>will</emph> assert my right to one or two hour's freedom every day.'</p>
               <p>"'I don't see how you can find time to get away, anyhow. I have to sew constantly,
                  when my housework is done. Silas wouldn't be bothered with the children,
                  either.'</p>
               <p>"I glanced at the quilt, which was suspended overhead, in the only decent room in
                  the house. There were four weeks hard work at least upon the quilting, to say
                  nothing of the elaborate patch-work.</p>
               <p>"'Which would you rather have, Mrs. Hill, good health or such work as this?"</p>
               <p>"The question evidently surprised her. 'You could do without it, couldn't you?" I
                  asked.</p>
               <p>"'Yes, I <emph>could.</emph> But like to have such things.'</p>
               <p>"'Well, take my advice,' I answered, 'and let quilts alone. You have enough to do
                  without toiling at such work as this.'</p>
               <p>"'If I should stop, what would the neighbors say?"</p>
               <p>"'What do they say of <emph>me?</emph> or what do I <emph>care?'</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"'If you don't care, I'll tell you what they say.'</p>
               <p>"'Let's hear it,' I answered, with a saucy laugh.</p>
               <p>"'Sally Norris,' (meaning her sister-in-law,) 'says you'd a plaguy sight better be
                  making quilts, than spending your spare time out of doors, like a big
                  tom-boy.'</p>
               <p>"'Tell Sallie Norris, to <emph>kiss my foot!'</emph> I was about to say, but
                  thought it didn't sound very polite, so I said, 'tell Sallie Norris that my
                  husband buys blankets and counterpanes and don't pay doctor's bills!'</p>
               <p>"'Just what I expected you would say,' she replied.</p>
               <p>"'But won't you take the ride?"</p>
               <p>"'No, I have a blister on my side, and it's too sore to bear the jolting,' and the
                  poor, wearied creature sunk into a chair. The baby began to cry, and without a
                  moment's rest, she took it up and gave it nourishment (?) from her heated
                  breast.</p>
               <p>"'You needn't expect to have good babies, when you feed them with side-ache,
                  fever, and sour stomachs,' I remarked, as I came up from the spring with two pails
                  of water.</p>
               <p>"'I don't ever expect to have any enjoyment!' she sobbed<pb n="284-285"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000143"/> in reply. 'It's one baby after another, as fast as
                  I can count them, and no help, and more hard work and less strength every
                  year!"</p>
               <p>"That raised my sympathy, so I said, 'tell Silas that I'm coming here this
                  afternoon, a self-invited guest to supper. He may make up his mind to get a

                  and who <emph>will</emph> play occasionally, out of doors!</p>
               <p>"I went home, prepared dinner for our workmen,—and we have a half
                  dozen—straightened everything up about right and by two o'clock, I was off for the
                  afternoon, with Flora riding behind and Henry before me, upon my favorite steed.
                  Of course, Maurice was in the secret, and was well pleased with the object of my
                  mission. I spent the afternoon in helping about that quilt aforesaid, and we got
                  it would not let me help her about the supper, so I attached the edges of the
                  quilt, and it was finished, binding and all, when Silas—all the neighbors call him
                  Silas—came in with his men to the supper, which was a nice one to look at though
                  there was a perceptible odor of hog's lard in the saleratus biscuits.</p>
               <p>"I'm ready for that scolding, Mrs. Stanton,' said 'mine host,' after supper.</p>
               <p>"It isn't worth while to tell you what I said. You know I said enough. He hinted

                  they don't do anything but help eat up the grass, and my hay crop's pretty short,
                  they might starve next winter.'</p>
               <p>"'If you had been that considerate years ago, your wife might have been spared
                  many hours of painful toil, and dozens of somebody's cattle would not have
                  starved. 'It's never too late to learn though," I added, as I departed, in the
                  best possible humor with myself and them too.</p>
               <p>"Three mornings have passed, and she has not yet failed to meet me in our rides.
                  She takes the baby with her, and says he isn't half so cross as when she keeps him
                  in the house constantly. Her cheeks were like June roses this morning, when she
                  bantered Mrs. Welden and me for a race. But you are wearying of this long story,
                  and I will change the subject.</p>
               <p>"Hugh and Fanny Waters were here last week, on a visit from Portland. Ask Herbert
                  if he has ever heard of Florence Willard? If he has not, I will tell him where he
                  can find her, if he will first come and see my little girl. He'd get accustomed to
                  the sight of Florence by <emph>degrees,</emph> if he should see my Flora first,
                  for the resemblance is striking.</p>
               <p>"I expect to meet you soon. Accept from me, all the love I can spare from Maurice
                  and the children, to be divided equally between your brother and yourself."</p>
               <p>"I would have known where this letter hailed from, if I had found it is Canada,
                  without name or postmark. The words drop from her pen just as they do from her
                  tongue. She never knows or eares how she will finish a sentence, when she begins
                  to speak or write it," said Herbert.</p>
               <p>"I believe she is he happiest creature I ever saw," Effie replied sorrowfully.</p>
               <p>"But she had passed through days of darkness, my dear sister. Think of that."</p>
               <p>"I know it, brother, but she knows nothing of the bitter sorrow that long years of
                  hope deferred: suspense that at last ripens into a certainly."</p>

               <p>"Pshaw! sister. You were my comforter one week ago, 'Sister, as you and I must
                  brave,'"—</p>
               <p>"Hush, Herbert; I don't want to hear that now. You are so happy now, that you
                  can't appreciate my troubles."</p>
               <p>"The darkest hour of the night is just before the morning, pet. Thew exhibition
                  day will soon be here, and I want folks to see that my sister's long term at
                  school has not been lost.</p>
               <p>"I shall do my best, as I have always done, to prepare for the occasion, Herbert.
                  I don't often repine. Never, when I see that other folks are sad; but when I
                  witness the <emph>happiness</emph> of others, it seems as if my own were long in
                  coming. I want to know what we are going to do after school. I will go to
                  teaching, if you are willing for me to do so."</p>
               <p>"No, sister, mine. Our home will not be complete unless you are in it. The money I
                  earned in the mines is now, every dollar, at my disposal. The interest of eight
                  thousand dollars has overpaid our school expenses. I loaned the money to a
                  responsible speculator who is to refund it on the first day of June, next. The
                  half section of land to which we were entitled as orphans, was secured for us by
                  Maurice Stanton, several years ago. As you know, it joins his land and is a lovely
                  location.</p>
               <p>"I am going to be a farmer, and show these Oregonians, who don't care how anything
                  looks, what I can do to beautify a claim. Floy is eager to live upon a farm, and I
                  have sent some carpenters, with all the building materials, up the river. We are
                  going to have a gothic cottage erected upon a spot that Maurice and Ada are to
                  choose. The first of October, your birthday, is to be our wedding day. If you
                  desire it, I would be glad if it could be yours too; but I am selfish enough to
                  care nothing about it only for your sake, because I want you to live with me.
                  'Look upon the brightest side of every cloud,' is your motto, dearie. We'll see
                  grand times yet."</p>
               <p>"Guess the news! Guess he news!" said Eliza Crandall, stopping Herbert and Effie
                  upon the front steps of the Institute. Seven years had made but little difference
                  in the appearance or disposition of this fun-loving girl, except that the wild,
                  easy <foreign xml:lang="FRA">abandon</foreign> of childhood had given way to a
                  more quiet grace, that softened the roguish outlines of her face in a semblance of
                  womanly beauty. "Guess the news!" she repeated. A dozen girls came forward, eager
                  to hear what their Punch had to communicate. Some of these girls were the smaller
                  children of Effie's first acquaintance at school, but the majority of them had not
                  been connected with the Institute but two or three years; the older ones having
                  almost all, either married, or moved away into the country. After keeping them in
                  suspense until she was satisfied, Eliza began her story:</p>
               <p>"There was a certain girl, fair to behold, with raven curls, and eyes like
                  burnished ebony, once gazing listlessly into the singing waters of a limpid
                  stream. Her face was perfect as sculpter's model, and upon her snowy hand rested
                  thoughtfully the queenly Sappho head. An open browed youth, an Adonis in
                  appearance, with thoughtful mien and downeast eyes, pursued his solitary way along
                  the shaded margin of the gleeful brooklet. Suddenly a vision stopped him. Eyes
                  from whose dark, clear depths, light gleamed forth, brighter than the most
                  effulgent sunbeams, were gazing into his own thoughtful orbs. And the youth bowed
                  as though a goddess smiled upon him, and he maiden returned the smile with a look
                  that Venus might have envied. For several days, they continued to meet at
                  intervals, along that rippling stream, and then their paths diverged. Adonis had
                  not used his potent eyes in vain, neither had Venus exerted her charms for naught.
                  The youth and maiden were sorely smitten, yet each longed to kiss the smiting
                  hand. Years passed, and they met not again, though they sought each other with
                     despairing<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6333-00000145"/> spairing energy. At
                  length they met, I will not tell you where. The maiden's Venus-like form had
                  ripened into womanhood, and upon the brow of the noble youth, the diadem of
                  manhood rested. Still, O Cupid, wast thou with them, and they bowed before thy
                  blinding mandates. One sad misfortune troubled them. As though the blind god had
                  determined that they should suffer, he had cast the barb of a half charmed arrow
                  from another source into the vicinity of the maiden's heart. She had bowed to what
                  she though was destiny, but the slumbering <emph>other</emph> flame broke forth
                  anew at sight of Herbert Goodwin; and Florence Willard yielded to its sway."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Eliza Crandall!</emph> when <emph>will</emph> your Quixotic propensities
                  cease?" exclaimed Herbert, half angrily, his face suffused with tell-tale
                  blushes.</p>
               <p>"Just when I cease to find attentive listeners, Monsieur la Herbert," she
                  answered, archly.</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Encore!</foreign>" said Bartholomew Barton, A.M., as he
                  emerged from behind a piller, where he had been stationed, an unobserved but
                  attentive listener; but who now came forward, laughing, as the dignitary had not
                  laughed since boyhood. "If you have another story of that kind on hand I would be
                  pleased to hear it. If not, please repeat the first one, as it is yet ten minutes
                  till school time. I see you are to have more listeners" he added, glancing towards
                  his dwelling, from which Mrs. Barton and the assistants were emerging.</p>
               <p>"I should be happy to oblige you Mr. Baron, but I really couldn't repeat it if I
                  should try. Perhaps, before I leave school, I can find another subject, if so I
                  promise to summon you to the rehersal," she replied, a little confused, but the
                  ludicrous, comic air she assumed, was so complete, that all who had heard the
                  story were enjoying a real anti-dispepsia explosion of laughter.</p>
               <p>"I think this joke is rather mere than equal to the one you got upon me about my
                  'first offer.' Do you not remember my 'sentimental savage?" said Effie to her
                  brother, as he started to the male department.</p>
               <p>He smiled, as he recalled the old scene. "Yes, I should call it considerably more
                  than 'equal,' though that was quite a 'circumstance,'" and he passed hurriedly
                  on.</p>
               <p>"Hang it! is that girl a necromancer, that she finds out the private affairs of
                  everybody in the school?" he muttered to himself.</p>
               <p>It was not her first attempt of the kind. Many had left that school and married,
                  who had been as ludicrously exposed as Herbert had been, though they thought they
                  had been equally sly about their future intentions. He had intended the whole
                  affair to be an agreeable surprise to his companions at the exhibition, when
                  Florence, a stranger to the whole school, would appear in company with Miss
                  Martin. He had a little conceit too, that when he should pay open attention to the
                  strange beauty, there would be some disappointment, much astonishment, and many
                  conjectures as to where she had come from, and how he had become acquainted with
                  her. How Eliza could have discovered the plot so soon, was a mystery, which
                  subsequent events were destined to unravel.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">HUBERT'S RETURN.</head>
               <p>The same excitement and bustle that characterized the preparations for the former
                  exhibitions, were resorted to in getting ready for this one. Mrs. Welden and her
                     children,<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6333-00000146"/> Florence and Miss Martin,
                  Maurice, Ada and Dr. Stanton, took lodgings that Herbert had secured for them, for
                  three days at a fashionable boarding house.</p>
               <p>Much progress had been made in the school by many of the students, for Mr. Barton
                  was not content with superficial accomplishments, but required careful and
                  thorough investigation of every science, while the art and practice of eloquent
                  speech and composition, received a due share of his judicious attention. Herbert
                  and Effie shared in the honors of the day, but their victory was not so exclusive
                  as on former occasions, for Eliza Crandall, to the astonishment of all who knew
                  her, came in for a share of the greatest honors, while many of the boys and girls,
                  whose talents were no wise remarkable, gained due credit for their un-looked for
                  progress.</p>
               <p>Effie had read her composition and had taken a seat upon the stage, while waiting
                  for Herbert and Eliza to finish a complicated dialogue, which, from its very
                  singularity, was attracting the undivided attention of everyone, when a shadow
                  darkened the doorway. She looked involuntarily at the intruder. Surprise drove the
                  blood from her cheeks; her vision reeled a moment, but the hot blood suddenly
                  mounted to her face again, giving a deeper hue to her sunny curls, and her nervous
                  movements agitated her robe of changeable blue and green French silk, which at
                  that moment was suddenly burnished by the sun rays that darted from behind a
                  western cloud, through the open window. The little jewelry she wore was tastefully
                  adjusted to suit her youthful appearance, for, though now in her twentieth year,
                  she appeared but little older than the girl of fourteen, who had so deeply
                  interested that audience, or part of it, more than six years before.</p>
               <p>The stranger, a noble looking young man, apparently twenty-six years of age
                  silently took a seat, attracting no particular attention from any one but Effie.
                  Hubert Munson bad grown a little in stature, and his slender figure had broadened
                  into the symmetrical proportions of a well built frame. He sported the luxuriant
                  whiskers of a foreigner, and had acquired something of the air of an Englishman,
                  by a residence in London, where for several years, he had lived and dreamed and
                  studied. He looked hard at Effie for a few moments and then his eye sought his
                  father's who averted his face, though Hubert knew he had been recognised.</p>
               <p>In compliance with his wife's request, Mr. Munson had once written to his son,
                  stating a report which, to do him justice, had acquired something of the semblance
                  of truth, that Effie was soon to be married to Ralph Holmes, a brother of
                  Winnie's, a lawyer, who before Winnie's marriage and removal to California, had
                  paid her marked attention.</p>
               <p>Hubert was advised to write to her no more, for, his father stated, she was
                  getting spoiled by flattery and attention, and his continued writing would only
                  add to his causes for mortification, in the end.</p>
               <p>Alas! for the boasted firmness of human integrity! Not withstanding his protested
                  faith in his betrothed, he had bitten his step-mother's bait from his father's
                  hand, and had been caught in the net of distrust. Mr. Munson believed that what he
                  had written would come true in time, for, to him, the idea that a city belle who
                  received attractive offers of marriage almost daily, would reject them all for the
                  sake of a first love, from whom she had heard nothing for years, was preposterous.
                  He advised his son to settle in London, after his travels were completed, where he
                  could have ample opportunity to drown his mortification in amusement and study.
                  For three years, he had spent his time in making researches in the science of
                  Astronomy, and had made discoveries in the starry world, of which he had never
                  dreamed.</p>
               <p>A sudden desire to visit his childhood's haunts had prompted him to seek once more
                  the abode of his youth. After a brief sojourn in the interior of Vermont, where
                  his mother had<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6333-00000147"/> lived and died, and a
                  hasty visit among his college "chums" who yet remained in Philadelphia, he
                  embarked for Oregon, little dreaming that the object of his former regard was yet
                  awaiting his coming with longing eyes and aching heart.</p>
               <p>Effie was too deeply absorbed in the one great idea of the <emph>returned,</emph>
                  to pay much heed to the closing exercises of the day. As if fate had planned a
                  romance of reality in which she was to figure as chief actress, the closing song
                  of the day was assigned to her and Herbert: her part being to sing and play, while
                  Herbert accompanied the performance with his flute. Her checks had assumed a
                  crimson hue, and the fire of suppressed feeling had kindled a glow of excitement
                  in her eyes, when she took her seat at the piano, facing the audience, and threw
                  her soul into the old-fashioned song: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>Maiden wherefore weepest thou?</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Weepest thou. weepest thou?</l>
                        <l>Maiden wherefore weepest thou?</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Weepest thou so sore?</l>
                        <l>When at distance from thee parted,</l>
                        <l>I will ever prove true hearted;</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Then dear maiden weep no more—</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Maiden weep no more.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Flute and piano were scarcely heard in comparison with the deep, earnest, musical
                  strains of the singer's voice, who, without an effort to act her part, warmed the
                  subject with the fire of her won deep heart. Power and pathos, such as never
                  before had so completely crowned her public efforts, were this time thrown into
                  the spirit of her song, and the listeners were entranced until, at the close,
                  instead of a shower of boquets and loud cries for more, old and young bowed their
                  heads in silence, and the tears of feeling dimmed the eyes of many. To cover the
                  silence which was beginning to grow embarrassing, Eliza Crandall, at a sign from
                  the Principal, took the seat the Effie resigned, and played a lively air which
                  gently lowered the listeners from the hight of feeling to which they had been
                  carried.</p>
               <p>A list of performances for the evening was read, and with many thanks to the
                  audience, Mr. Barton dismissed them until evening.</p>
               <p>As soon as Hubert could elbow his way through the throng of ladies and gentlemen,
                  who were striving to gain admittance to the circle of successful students, he
                  stepped up to Effie and offered his hand. He gazed earnestly into her eyes; a look
                  that puzzled her, as she did not know that for years he had thought her
                  married.</p>
               <p>"When did you return?" she asked, hesitatingly.</p>
               <p>"I reached the city about an hour ago."</p>
               <p>"Why have you been absent so long?"</p>
               <p>"No matter now. Is your brother present?"</p>
               <p>"Excuse me; I had not thought but that you were acquainted. My brother, Mr.
                  Munson."</p>
               <p>Herbert looked surprised as he so suddenly confronted the intelligent looking
                  stranger of whom he had heard so much, and the thought that his sister had made a
                  good selection, crossed his mind, as he cordially grasped his hand.</p>
               <p>"I will see you again, Miss Goodwin, at present, I must look for father," he said
                  in an undertone, as he bowed himself away.</p>
               <p>Eliza Crandall observed aside to Mr. Barton, that if he wanted to hear another
                  romance of reality, he might hide behind a pillar the next morning, and she could
                  entertain him with a story equal to the last one she had invented. "And," she
                  added, "it isn't wholly an invention, either."</p>
               <p>Hubert met his father at the door. A few words of greeting passed, and he asked
                  him to step aside from the crowd.</p>
               <p>"Father, why did you write me that Effie Goodwin was to be married, so long
                  ago?"</p>
               <p>"I wrote just what I had reason to believe, from Ralph Holmes's attentions and her
                  manner of receiving them, would be the result of their intimacy."</p>
               <pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6333-00000148"/>
               <p>"And when you found that the report was untrue, why didn't you inform me of the
                  mistake?"</p>
               <p>"I never thought it necessary. I dare say now, that she doesn't care a fig for
                  you."</p>
               <p>"That doesn't clear your skirts, dear father. How am I to face her and say that
                  the blame of my misconduct rests upon my father's head?"</p>
               <p>"Don't be concerned about that. You can tell her that your studies kept you away.
                  If she cares anything about you, she'll be too happy to ask many questions; and if
                  she doesn't regard you very particularly, you needn't tell her anything," he
                  replied, turning, as if anxious to get away from the scrutinizing gaze of his
                  son.</p>
               <p>Hubert stationed himself at the door, intending to escort Effie to her boarding
                  house, but Hugh Waters, whose matrimonial intentions were a secret to all but the
                  one interested, had the post, and only stopping to receive an anxious smile from
                  his betrothed, he turned away and walked rapidly towards his father's
                  dwelling.</p>
               <p>"Why, Hubert! you here?" exclaimed his step-mother, as he passed the carriage in
                  which she was seated, waiting for her husband to get through a political argument
                  with an aspiring political demagogue.</p>
               <p>Herbert offered his hand.</p>
               <p>"You got the mitten, did you?" she said exultingly.</p>
               <p>"I didn't <emph>forge letters!</emph> he replied indignantly, with marked
                  emphasis. "Where is Allie?"</p>
               <p>"There she comes."</p>
               <p>Hubert turned and beheld the little creature, now over six years old, coming
                  towards the carriage. She was tastefully and elaborately dressed, and as beautiful
                  as childhood, innocence, and finery could make her. "What a pity it is that we
                  can't always be children," he said bitterly, as he kissed his little sister, who
                  seemed to know him.</p>
               <p>"We have told her so much about you, that she considers herself acquainted," said
                  her mother, wishing to turn his mind from the thoughts she knew he was indulging
                  in regard to herself. He did not reply, but the child in the carriage and
                  continued his homeward walk. But few of his old acquaintances recognised him, and
                  he had no further interruption until be reached his father's door. The old Irish
                  cook admitted him. with a "bless me soul, honey, how ye do change!" as she scanned
                  his be-whiskered countenance.</p>
               <p>He entered the garden, the "trysting place" of days gone by and paced the gravel
                  walks in no enviable mood.</p>
               <p>"Is this the reception I am doomed to meet, after so many years of absence," he
                  said aloud.</p>
               <p>He heard his father at the door, and entered the parlor just as Allie came in all
                  smiles and happiness to greet him. His father asked him many questions concerning
                  his travels and life abroad, but he was not in a conversing humor, and would only
                  talk in monosyllables. He glanced at the mirror and started at the sight of his
                  be-whiskered visage.</p>
               <p>"While dinner is preparing, I believe I'll run up town and get shaved, father," he
                  remarked as he left the house.</p>
               <p>"This is an awkward business, Hattie," said Mr. Munson impatiently. "I'll never
                  trouble myself with match-making or breaking, again, that is certain.</p>
               <p>'Yes, it's awkward. That impudent jade will make out a great story upon her side.
                  If Hubert could know her as well as I do, he'd change his mind about her
                  artlessness, of which he has boasted so much.</p>
               <p>"I don't know. If I had followed the dictates of my own conscience, I could now be
                  prepared to welcome her as a daughter. As it is, I have hearkened to you, and
                  cannot look either her or Hubert in the face."</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> can!"</p>
               <p>"I pity you then!" he answered indignantly.</p>
               <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6333-00000149"/>
               <p>Hubert soon emerged from a barber's shop, and had started back to his father's,
                  when he met Hugh Waters, who gave him his card, and joined him in his walk.</p>
               <p>"Miss Goodwin commissioned me to inform you that she will be pleased to see you in
                  the drawing-room of the —— hotel."</p>
               <p>"Are you a friend of the young lady's"</p>
               <p>"I once wanted to be something more so, but she told me confidentially that she
                  was engaged, and my fancy then wandered in another direction. I suppose the news
                  will not spread very far, by us letting you into the secret."</p>
               <p>Hubert felt a little vexed at the stranger's rudeness, and was about to reply,
                  when Hugh informed him that they were opposite the hotel.</p>
               <p>Fanny Waters and Effie were standing at a bay window, looking at the river, and
                  talking in an earnest undertone.</p>
               <p>Well, Mr. Run-away! Here have Effie and I been waiting for fifteen minutes, for
                  you to escort us down to dinner" said Fanny to Hugh, before she noticed that Hugh
                  was with him.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Munson, my sister," said Hugh.</p>
               <p>Effie offered a chair, and dropped into a seat, feeling deadly faint.</p>
               <p>"I expect nothing else but that that greedy company will devour the last remnant
                  of that savory meal. Come Hugh," and the brother and sister left the room.</p>
               <p>The interview was painful to both the lovers, for a few moments, but soon,
                  forgetful of all past doubts and troubles, Effie was pillowing her head upon his
                  bosom,—happy as a mortal could be. "I always <emph>knew</emph> you would come,"
                  she said, lovingly.</p>
               <p>"If I had not been a <emph>villain,</emph> I would have come <emph>years
                     ago!</emph> Do you know why I staid away?"</p>
               <p>"Your father told me one day last week, that you had settled in Europe, and would
                  never return. He didn't tell me why."</p>
               <p>"Well, I will tell you. He wrote me, more than four years ago, that you were going
                  to be married to Ralph Holmes. It was a rumor he had heard, and he never took the
                  pains to correct it."</p>
               <p>Effie started with surprise. "Would your father do such a thing?"</p>
               <p>"Not of himself, my birdie. But in his case you know there is a power behind the
                  throne, 'greater than the throne.' He is to be pitied, not blamed."</p>
               <p>"I forgive him, with all my heart."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>said</emph> that time would only clothe my peerless one with deeper
                  loveliness, and, than Heaven, the prophecy is fulfilled!" he exclaimed, as he
                  caught her in his arms.</p>
               <p>"I'm happy to say that I can return the compliment," was the blushing reply."</p>
               <p>Footsteps were heard in the hall, and soon the room was filled with Effie's
                  friends, all of whom were introduced to Hubert.</p>
               <p>"Did you get enough to eat, Fanny?" Effie asked, making a merciful attempt to
                  start a conversation.</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, Miss Willard, but I wish to know if Michigan is not your native
                  State?"</p>
               <p>"It is, why?"</p>
               <p>"you so completely resemble a maternal aunt of mine who married a Mr. Willard, in
                  Vermont, and afterwards removed to Michigan, that I almost called you cousin."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible? What was your mother's name?"</p>
               <p>Reynolds."</p>
               <p>"The same. Isn't this like a story book? Rejoice with me, Effie, I have found my
                  long-lost cousin Hubert!"</p>
               <p>'She'll do that!" said Hugh, slyly; then aloud—"I'd like to see you get a straight
                  thread out of this tangle."</p>
               <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6333-00000150"/>
               <p>"We are all interested," remarked Ada.</p>
               <p>Florence withdrew a few paces from her cousin, and related the following
                  story:—</p>
               <p>"My grandfather Reynolds had two daughters. One of them married a Mr. Munson, and
                  settled in the old Vermont homestead. The other married Mr. Willard, who removed
                  to Michigan, and remained there until I, his daughter, was eleven years old. He
                  then died of quick consumption, and my mother soon followed him to the grave. We
                  wrote to Uncle Munson, but received no answer, and did not know where he had gone.
                  A bachelor uncle, a brother of my fathers brought me with him to this country, and
                  I have this hour found a cousin, of whom I had not heard for twelve years. This is
                  my romance. I might spin this 'untangled thread' into a skein three thousand miles
                  long if I had the patience to do so, and could get listeners," she said, turning
                  to Hugh. "Now Hubert, we must hear your story."</p>
               <p>"My father has been in Oregon ten years. He removed here shortly after his second
                  marriage, for, like my cousin, I was left motherless at an early age. Our mothers
                  were twin sisters. Floy's mother had just such ringlets as she has. Her eyes were
                  as black and features as fair. Mine, though equally fair, had brown, glossy hair,
                  and pale blue eyes. I was a frolicing youngster of five years when aunt Mildred
                  was married. I was her but seldom after her removal, but I remember her distinctly
                  now, as the very image of my newly-found cousin."</p>
               <p>"We'll have to call upon Eliza Crandall to weave a romance out of this meeting,"
                  said Herbert to his sister.</p>
               <p>"I can <emph>do</emph> it!" exclaimed Eliza, roguishly, as she stepped from behind
                  a screen, where she had placed herself without being seen by the others, much to
                  the amusement of Mrs. Welden and Ada.</p>
               <p>"You've dropped from cloud-land, haven't you?" Her bert was confused out of all
                  thought of playful repartee, but Fanny came to the rescue.</p>
               <p>"No, she hadn't dropped from cloud land, only stepped from behind a screen. Mrs.
                  Stanton showed me her retreat and I've been aching to point her out for the last
                  ten minutes.'</p>
               <p>"Are you anxious to hear the story, Mr. Goodwin? I suppose I must call you Mr. In
                  company, though you're plain <emph>Herbert</emph> at school."</p>
               <p>"You needn't mind the story, or the 'Mr.' either, for that matter. At present we
                  will try to be satisfied with realities and consign romances to oblivion."</p>
               <p>"The 'realities' were what I proposed to tell, but of course I shan't insist upon
                  it. There is one married man in the company, and I'm going to talk to him awhile."
                  she took a seat beside Maurice and was soon conversing upon a scientific topic
                  with an interest that surprised him.</p>
               <p>"I think," said Mrs. Welden, aside to Ada, "that Cupid is at work all around us.
                  Miss Waters is the only person I see, who is not smitten."</p>
               <p>"Do you thin Miss Crandall has yielded to Cupid's machinations?"</p>
               <p>"If you'll remark the glances between her and Hugh, you'll find out whether she
                  has yielded or not. They studiously avoid each other, and long as we have known
                  him, he has never hinted that he was acquainted with her."</p>
               <p>"You're ahead of me in reading physiognomy, Meggie."</p>
               <p>"Fanny, don't you ever get smitten with the Oregon mania of getting married?"</p>
               <p>"Why, Mrs. Stanton! do you suppose anybody would have <emph>me?</emph> I'm twenty
                  two years old! There's no chance for me in this country, unless I marry some old
                  widower with a house full of children, and spend my life in servitude, just for
                  the honor of being a Mrs. My father can do better by me than any fellow can, who
                  will <emph>have</emph> me," and she laughed<pb n="300-301"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000151"/> ed a merry peal, that did not sound as though she
                  regretted having lived single until grown.</p>
               <p>"Ladies and gentlemen, you will please excuse me until the Institute bell rings. I
                  promised my father to return to dinner, and have stayed until twilight," said
                  Hubert, looking at his watch.</p>
               <p>Something attracted Herbert's attention. "Mr. Munson will you please to let me
                  look at that watch?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly."</p>
               <p>Herbert took the valuable gold repeater in his hand, while he trembled with
                  emotion.</p>
               <p>"What's the matter, brother?"</p>
               <p>"Look!" and he pointed to the initials engraved upon the inside of the case. "<hi
                     rend="i"/>G. H. G.—George Horace Goodwin; my father and grandfather's
                  name."</p>
               <p>"But perhaps there is some mistake," and Effie grew as deeply excited as her
                  brother was.</p>
               <p>"No, here's a scratch that I made with my penknife, before mother sold it. I did
                  it purposely, for I felt that I should sometime see it again."</p>
               <p>"I purchased it at a pawnbroker's shop in New York at a reduced price. I have
                  carried it ever since I arrived at New York, when I started upon my long
                  travelling expedition,—more than six years ago. I bought it before I had been in
                  the city an hour." and he loosed the chain from its intricate loopings at his
                  side, telling Herbert to keep it until he was ready to pay for its cost, adding
                  that its use had been compound interest on the money invested in its purchase.</p>
               <p>"Be sure to come back in time to go with us to the Institute," said Florence, as
                  he moved away.</p>
               <p>"Trust me for that. I couldn't be hired to remain away." with a meaning smile,
                  that was half directed toward Effie, who grew very deeply interested in the
                  newly-found watch.</p>
               <p>"Miss Martin you must be taking items, you have nothing to say," said Mrs. Welden,
                  with a smile.</p>
               <p>"There is material for 'items' here, that is certain. I was just now remarking the
                  healthy bloom upon Mrs. Crandall's cheeks. We don't often see such rosy faces
                  among the married ladies of Oregon."</p>
               <p>"The farmer's wives are overworked in-doors, and the city ladies too little
                  exercise in-doors or out. I turned as new leaf under Mrs. Stanton's directions,
                  and from a nervous, half-sick, dependent creature, I have become—through the
                  blessing of God, and the free use of His mountain air—restored to perfect
                  health."</p>
               <p>"I have frequently written to my friends in the East about the poor health of
                  Oregon ladies."</p>
               <p>"If you had written respecting our pure country air, which the farmer's wives are
                  generally too badly overworked, to enjoy, and had used your influence to induce
                  those in need to employment, who would gladly work, in our kitchens, if they could
                  get the chance, to come to us, your letters would have done more good."</p>
               <p>"I thank you for setting me right, for I had concluded that women could not be
                  healthy in this country, at all."</p>
               <p>"We are <emph>not</emph> so strong as our mother's were, but if we will live and
                  work, in proportion to our strength, and use proper exercise and healthy food, we
                  can have uninterrupted good health. I have too much faith in God to believe that
                  He would send sickness or early death upon us if we did not violate his laws."</p>
               <p>"But there are places where, if we live so nearly to the rules for life and
                  health, we will be sick, because the air is impure. Who makes that impure
                  air?"</p>
               <p>"God makes the <emph>cause</emph> that produces the <emph>effect.</emph> The
                     <emph>cause</emph> is the necessary decay of vegetation, or oft-times, the
                  stagnation of standing water, &amp;c. But our natural senses immediately<pb
                     n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6333-00000152"/> diately warn us to keep away, when we
                  enter the vicinity of such places, or to render the air pure by drainage and
                  fires. In our eagerness to amass riches, we settle in such places and cannot take
                  the time to drain the marshes and destroy decaying matter. Again, in Milwaukie,
                  and other places I could name, where ague is prevalent, a company of speculators,
                  with more enterprise than discretion, form huge milldams, which they can't afford
                  to drain occasionally, lest their work should stop, and the water becomes
                  diseased, poisonous. Sickness is a natural consequence; an effort of nature to
                  throw off the impurities that are constantly inhaled, eaten or drank. Doses of
                  calomel and quinine are administered, that appear to check the progress of disease
                  for a while, but a permanent cure is not effected. The patient worries through a
                  few miserable years; blames the country and his God; nature gives up the struggle,
                  and he dies. Mankind is the author of much mischief and misery that are attributed
                  to mysterious Providences."</p>
               <p>"But why are women mere subject to disease than men?"</p>
               <p>"Because they get less pure air, and let men say what they will to the contrary,
                  they endure more slavish toil than they do. Whoever heard of Oregon men working
                  like slaves all day, and then sitting up till midnight to sew, without having
                  scarcely tasted the unadulterated nectar of God's pure atmosphere for weeks?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Welden had become so interested with her theme that she did not notice the
                  attention she was attracting. Dr. Stanton eyed her curiously over his
                  spectacles.</p>
               <p>"Madam, where did you get your skill?" he asked, when she had ceased.</p>
               <p>"From common sense, from experience, and from your son and daughter," she replied,
                  promptly.</p>
               <p>"Did you <emph>ever!</emph> Here are two women and an M.D., discussing hygiene, as
                  though life and death were at stake this moment and they were judges of the
                  wager," said Hugh.</p>
               <p>"Health and life and death are very nearly allied, Hugh," said Mrs. Welden,</p>
               <p>"O, if I'm going to get a charnel-house lecture, I'll say no more," he replied,
                  trying to laugh.</p>
               <p>"Why, brother! how <emph>can</emph> you be so rude to ladies, and speak so
                  jestingly of horrible things," said Fanny.</p>
               <p>"They are not 'horrible' to those who keep accounts balanced between themselves
                  and God," said Ada, with a radiant smile. "I hope you will 'consider,' Hugh. What
                  is horrible, is the manner in which such things are spoken of."</p>
               <p>"I'm not in the humor to hear theological points discussed just now, and you will
                  pardon me for changing the subject."</p>
               <p>"I will dismiss it, Hugh, but let me first tell you that you can't
                     <emph>always</emph> change it."</p>
               <p>Hubert re-entered at this moment, the college-bell began to toll, and a general
                  harry of preparation among ladies and children, changed the current of
                  conversation.</p>
               <p>"I think you'll have company without me, won't you, Floy," whispered her cousin,
                  playfully.</p>
               <p>"Certainly, I'm not in the habit of going without an escort. I'm certain I shan't
                  need <emph>your</emph> services," and cast a roguish glance into his eyes as
                  Herbert took his place by her side.</p>
               <p>Effie looked more lovely than she had ever appeared before. The sudden excitement
                  that had kindled the glow upon her cheeks, served to keep it there; and her
                  bright, blue eyes emitted a beaming light of awakened happiness.</p>
               <p>Hubert whispered, "I am proud of you," a dozen times, during their walk. Hagh took
                  his place beside Eliza, to whom he had been engaged for a year, but whose company
                  he had never kept in public, until now.</p>
               <p>"A married man has to perform double duty, five times told," laughed Maurice, as
                  he escorted Fanny, Ada, Mrs. Welden, Miss Martin, and the six children into the
                  street.</p>
               <pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6333-00000153"/>
               <p>"No one is better suited to the task," said Hugh. "Besides, you will soon have
                  help," he continued, as Dr. Stanton, sen'r., took his grand-children each by the
                  hand, repeating endearing coaxings and jests.</p>
               <p>"What did you really <emph>think</emph> of Mrs. Welden's talk this evening Hugh?"
                  Eliza asked.</p>
               <p>"It's important, I suppose. But when health, death, or Providence, is the theme of
                  conversation, I always want to be away. I must apologies to the ladies though, for
                  my thoughtless talk."</p>
               <p>"Hugh; I begin to think seriously of serious matters. My school-days are now over,
                  and I am going to see if I can't live as Mrs. Stanton and Mrs. Welden do. I'm
                  afraid of them for I'm not so good as they are. Effie and Florence also, belong to
                  their stamp. I looked at them to-day, when you thought I hadn't a serious or solid
                  thought in my rattle-pated cranium, and secretly resolved, with the help of God,
                  to do and be like them."</p>
               <p>"If you are going to be 'good', I'd rather see you imitate them, than many others
                  I could name, who profess to be religious, but deep-toned morality, I confess,
                  always stifles <emph>me.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I hope you'll talk differently from this, before long, Hugh. If you knew how I
                  desire to see you lay aside your clownishness, I believe you'd try to do it."</p>
               <p>"Physician, heal thyself, I might say, but there is more sense in your fun than
                  mine; I'll have to admit that."</p>
               <p>"I'll try to quit it, if you will."</p>
               <p>"I want you always to be cheerful, dear. Christianity would take better with the
                  world, if those who profess it, would be 'not as the hypocrites are, of a sad
                  countenance,' that takes the from of a holy horror, whenever their particular
                  views are contradicted."</p>
               <p>Holy and contented joy beamed in the breasts of each of our friends, on that happy
                  evening.</p>
               <p>"Loving and beloved." Than this there is not a more hallowed bliss, this side of
                  Heaven. And if such union of feeling causes so holy a sensation in our souls upon
                  earth, will we not realize and enjoy it to a still greater extent in the bowers of
                  Paradise? We honestly believe that those who ridicule this holy joy upon the
                  earth, are they who will be "least in the kingdom of Heaven."</p>

               <p>HUBERT MUNSON determined to live the life of a farmer. His father was horrified at

                  name."</p>
               <p>In compliance with the request of their friends, Effie and Florence agreed that
                  the double wedding should take place at the house of Maurice Stanton, upon the
                  first day of October. His lovely country seat was now furnished and neatly fitted
                  up throughout. As an example of what diligence and economy may do in a new
                  country, we will notice his success in seven years of toil and pleasure. He had
                  lived in accordance with his principle, that none need be discontented because his
                  ambition is clogged by poverty. He began with almost nothing, but instead of not
                  allowing himself to <emph>live</emph> while preparing himself a comfortable home
                  for the future, he "<emph>lived all the time.</emph>" While many who began with
                  better prospects than Maurice did, but were not content to <emph>work and
                     wait,</emph> spent the same number of years in constant anxiety and toil,
                  always moving from "post to pillar," and engaging in this scheme and that,
                  prospered slowly or not at all, <emph>he grew up with the country.</emph> These
                  migratory, notional, scheming persons cannot <emph>live;</emph> they
                     <emph>exist,</emph> it is true, but so fluctuating is their business, and so
                  futile many of their speculations, that wholesome quietude is something unknown or
                  unexpected at least with certainty. But to return to the wedding:</p>
               <p>It was evening, A gay company of happy persons, young and old, were collected in
                  Ada's pleasant and ample parlor. Conspicuous among the most honored guests, were
                  Farmer Gray's folks, Daddy family, and Sam Green, with his freckly-faced wife and
                  numerous progeny. Herbert said that they were too kind to his mother, when she
                  needed their help, for him to neglect them, if they <emph>were</emph> coarse and
                  unrefined. The contrast between them and a few chosen, aristocratic guests from
                  the cities, was amusing, but Maurice, Ada and the brides and grooms elect, did not
                  appear to discern the difference. The hostess introduced them to her most
                  distinguished guests, told how they became acquainted, and caressed Polly's
                  awkward, sun-burnt, tow-headed children, as though their clothing was muslin and
                  embroidery, instead of blue-drilling and calico.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Stanton exhibits shocking bad taste!" said Mrs. Warren, whom we recognize as
                  Augusta Morton. She had caught Florence's discarded lover, and this was the
                  commencement of a wedding excursion from Portland to Corvallis. George Danvers,
                  with whom we also became slightly acquainted at Mrs. Card's soirce, was present
                  with his bride, Delphine Howard that was, who looked upon the rustic company with
                  a curling underlip. They were not Brook upon the wedding occasion, Effie thought,
                  from prying curiosity.</p>
               <p>"When I saw Mrs. Stanton at Oregon City last summer, I didn't think she had such
                  neighbors as these. I should think she'd be ashamed of them! She knows we never
                  stoop to associate with such folks," said the amiable Mrs. Warren.</p>
               <p>"Oh, she's as independent as Herbert and his sister, or Eliza Crandall. I believe
                  Floy Willard is just such a creature, as great a lady as she must consider herself
                  to be. By the way, do you know when Eliza is going to be married? I hear that Hugh
                  Waters is paying particular private '<unclear>distresses</unclear>,' to her,"
                  replied Mrs. Danvers.</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! he won't have her! He's a gentleman, but she is many removes from a
                  lady."</p>
               <p>"Hush! we'll attract listeners. We don't know what kind of company we're in."</p>
               <p>A stir was occasioned by the arrival of two ministers, who entered the front
                  parlor, with pleasant smiles and agreeable<pb n="310-311"
                     xml:id="VAC6333-00000156"/> able words for all. Folding doors, that
                  communicated with a richly furnished boudoir, were opened and the brides elect
                  appeared, looking like spirits from cloud-land, and leaning upon the arms of their
                  noble looking suitors. Fanny Waters and Eliza Crandall were the bridesmaids, and
                  Hugh Waters and George Crandall, a brother of Eliza's lately returned from
                  California, were the chosen groomsmen. Dresses of white gauze, tastefully trimmed
                  with blue, flowing vails and wreaths of orange flowers, draped the exquisite forms
                  of the brides with aerial loveliness. Mrs. Gray thought it was "mighty
                  extravagant, but as they didn't <emph>owe</emph> nothin' she guessed it wasn't
                  nobody's business."</p>
               <p>The bystanders scarcely breathed during the short doubly-spoken ceremony; and the
                  prayer, so appropriate, so touching, caused the tears to fall from many eyes. If
                  Herbert looked noble, as he held the hand of his beautiful, marble-faced bride,
                  Hubert looked none the less so, as he gazed upon the glowing cheeks of his chosen
                  one.</p>
               <p>The wedding banquet, being a novelty in its way, should not be overlooked. Instead
                  of a vast amount of enticing and indigestible knick-knackeries, a well filled
                  board of healthy food was presented without apology or comment to the wondering
                  guests. Tropical fruits of the most delicious kinds, and the native productions,
                  both wild and tame, so common in the territory, were prepared in a manner that
                  reflected great credit upon Mrs. Stanton's culinary skill; while choice viands of
                  many descriptions, which she knew contained no unhealthy ingredients, were
                  bountifully provided.</p>
               <p>"The health of the bride! Let's say with Mr. Toots,—what <emph>is</emph> it, Ada?
                  I've forgotten," said Maurice, as he poured from a decanter a ruby liquid, which
                  caused those who knew his habits to stare.</p>
               <p>"You'll have to consult 'Dombey and son;' you can't prove it by me," she said,
                  with a laugh as amusing as his own.</p>
               <p>"Ruther than a toast shall be missed because ye ain't smart enough to get one off,
                  I'll propose this one—May their shadows never be less!" said Farmer Gray, adding
                  to the humor that Maurice had started.</p>
               <p>The glasses were filled, but a few were too temperate to partake of the convivial
                  cup. Ada looked archly at Maurice. "shall I tell the secret?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, they'll be the wiser for it."</p>
               <p>"To those of you who are not acquainted with the mysteries of my kitchen craft, I
                  have a secret to communicate. This wine, which you appear afraid to touch, is the
                  pure, unfermented, unadulterated juice of Oregon berries. The straw-berries,
                  salmon-berries, dew, or black-berries, thimble-berries and whortle-berries, have
                  all contributed their luscious juices to form this concoction, which is flavored
                  by a little lemon juice."</p>
               <p>"Why, how do you keep it from fermenting?" asked one, beginning to taste the
                  delicous beverage.</p>
               <p>"I pour it while boiling hot into stout glass or earthen jars, and seal them
                  immediately, setting them in the dairy, bottom end up; they will keep for years,
                  that is, if we'll let them alone, which is rather doubtful."</p>
               <p>"How did you <emph>learn</emph> to do this?"</p>
               <p>"It's an invention of my own; and if I were not a very accommodating personage,
                  I'd make a monopoly of my discovery," with affected naivette.</p>
               <p>The evening, which gave promise of being so pleasant, was taking its departure in
                  a driving rain. Those who lived within six or eight miles of the mansion, had
                  expected to return home, but the storm beat piteously against the windows and
                  howled through the now almost denuded branches of the kingly oaks, warning them to
                  stay in doors, and wait for its fury to abate. Music, repartee, conversation
                  respecting gold mines, farming, stock, race-horses, high-schools, the<pb
                     n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6333-00000157"/> weather, the grass, the fern, the fir
                  timber, new buildings and politics, were the amusements until late. The rain had
                  ceased to fall in torrents, and a fine, driving mist filled the air, and a
                  'darkness that could be felt,' obscured the nearest objects. Going home was
                  impossible, and there were not sleeping accommodations enough in the house for
                  others than the many who had come from a distance. Maurice was at a loss but Ada's
                  quick wit soon drove away his perplexity.</p>
               <p>"I am manage this dilemma to a nicety, Maurice. The barn is full of sweet hay,
                  upon which the men can sleep, and I can make family beds over the carpets for the
                  ladies and children."</p>
               <p>"It takes a woman to make the best of an emergency. This is the very thing. Come,
                  gentlemen, there are not more than twenty of you; I can stow you away in the hay
                  as snugly as mice," and he lighted a lantern, buttoned a great coat under his
                  chin, and led the van of retreating sleep-hunters.</p>
               <p>"Why don't you go too?" said Ada, aside to Herbert. "Nobody wants you here," and
                  she listened to the many retreating footsteps.</p>
               <p>"I would have gone, but Hubert wouldn't go with me. He's my partner."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Is</emph> he? shall I bear that in mind?"</p>
               <p>"Do just as you please. I've been expecting a volley o jokes from you for the last
                  two hours. The next time you get married, I'll see if <emph>I</emph> can't have
                  some fun."</p>
               <p>"I shan't invite you to the wedding," and she flitted away like a girl of
                  sixteen.</p>
               <p>The men in the barn had an inspiriting time. Every country Oregonian carries a
                  blanket, and, in case of an unexpeced bivouac, his Spanish saddle serves as a
                  pillow. A man who cannot sleep comfortably when thus equipped, is laughed at more
                  than pitied. The men from the cities were pleased with the novelty of a "sleep in
                  the hay," and a blanket from Ada's ample store, for each pair of them, was
                  bed-clothing sufficient for the occasion. Mrs. Gray was sorely troubled. "No-body
                  ever hearn of a weddin' on a stormy night that turned out well, and she was mighty
                  'fraid there was other storms a brewin'."</p>
               <p>"Don't be alarmed, Mrs. Gray, there'll be no storms that won't blow over, I'll
                  guarantee that," said Eliza.</p>
               <p>The morning, pleasant and clear, dawned before much sleep was thought of. Choice
                  leavings from the nuptial banquet were re-served for breakfast, and the clock
                  pointed suggestively to the farmer's dinner hour, before the "Bounding Elk," was
                  hailed by Warren and Danvers, who, with their brides, took a formal leave of the
                  newly married pairs, promising to call upon their return from "up the
                  country."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Farmer Gray, "I believe we've troubled ye long enough. Sally, ye'd as
                  well git ready while I yoke up the Durhams."</p>
               <p>"Do you still work oxen, Farmer Gray?" Effie asked.</p>
               <p>"Of course I do. D'ye s'pose I'd have horses here, when I never had none in
                  Suckerdom. The roads in my burgh ain't fit for horse wagons, no how. If the old
                  woman can't ride behind my steers, she can walk or stay at home."</p>
               <p>"You could afford to purchase horses, couldn't you?"</p>
               <p>"I reckon I <emph>can</emph> afford it! I sold six thousand dollars worth of
                  apples a month ago, an' didn't owe a dollar afore that."</p>
               <p>"Have you <emph>buried</emph> the money?" Effie asked involuntarily. She looked
                  with amazement at his coarse cassimere coat, cowhide boots, and home-made straw
                  hat, and then glanced at the garb of his wife, who was attired to suit her idea of
                  economy, in a dark delaine dress, and checked gingham apron.</p>
               <p>"Don't accuse <emph>me</emph> of buryin' money! I bought another section o' land
                  for me an' Sam, an' two thousand dollars worth o' cattle."</p>
               <pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6333-00000158"/>
               <p>"Have you built a new house?"</p>
               <p>"Well I have? It's a better house than I had in Illinois. The logs is hewed, an'
                  there's no mud in the cracks. I lined it inside an' out, with shaved cedar lumber.
                  But I shan't tell ye any more about it. Ye can come an' see for yerself how we're
                  a swimmin', for I tell ye, hard times is over with us."</p>
               <p>"I guess we will call and see you the day after to-morrow; we are going to see my
                  new sister's uncle, and can go by your house."</p>
               <p>"That's all right. We won't be at home afore to-morrow evening', but Sally'll have
                  lots o' good fodder fixed up afore you git there."</p>
               <p>Polly joined in urging them to visit her, and they were all soon homeward bound;
                  Sam, Polly and he children riding in the wagon with their parents and Charlie
                  Graves, while Daddy Green's folks galloped ahead on horseback.</p>
               <p>"Well," said Herbert, watching the slowly retreating wagon, "I do wonder what that
                  man wants with so much land. Twelve hundred and eighty acres, and anxious to get
                  more!"</p>
               <p>"Land will be worth ten times its present value in Oregon, before ten years," said
                  Ada.</p>
               <p>"Yes, when he's under the sod, and his heirs are qurrelling over it. I'm going to
                  see how I can make my farm of one hundred and sixty acres appear and 'pan
                  out.'"</p>
               <p>"Effie, are you going to live upon a farm?" said Maurice.</p>
               <p>"That is our intention. Mr. Munson thinks he'll like to live upon a farm near
                  brother and Floy."</p>
               <p>"I am not going to <emph>let</emph> them go away, Mr. Stanton. They must live with
                  us until their house is done. This little lilly of the valley shall not be
                  transplanted to a mountain top," said Florence turning her fingers in her sisters
                  glossy hair.</p>
               <p>"You speak in riddles, dear Florence."</p>
               <p>"Which I can easily solve, sister. We are going to keep you in your native
                  element. You are delicate now, and will not thrive in the city, where you can't
                  smell wildwood flowers, and romp over grassy meadows."</p>
               <p>"What have you to say about it, Hubert."</p>
               <p>"I agree to their plans, I hate to be a drone in society, and I am going to work.
                  Like Herbert, I intend to see what I can do beautify a farm. Unlike Farmer Gray, I
                  think more of my eye than my pocket, but I believe if Stanton can get along so
                  well as a farmer, <emph>my</emph> pockets won't suffer, either, for I believe I am
                  about as clever as he is. Come Mr. Stanton, tell us the secret of your success.
                  Effie tells me that you began here, seven years ago, without friends or money.
                  Now, you have a healthy wife, so uncommon a sight in these days, beautiful
                  children, and everything around you that heart can wish."</p>
               <p>"My wife has done the work of two or three women in the time you speak of. The
                  simple reason why she stands it so well, is because she never works unless she is
                  able to do so. The most useful machine on a farm should certainly be kept in
                  repair. If she gets a little sick, I put her on a horse and turn her out in the
                  hills, doing the housework myself, until she gets well. It's all nonsence that a
                  man hasn't the <emph>time</emph> to do so, which is the common excuse. Such men
                  find time to bury their wives and hunt others when they die."</p>
               <p>"Hubert, you and I must take pattern after him in our new relations. I hope scores
                  of years will pass away before my Ploy's animation leaves her. I'll do what I can
                  to make her life a pleasant one."</p>
               <p>"I hope, Herbert, that your regard for my welfare will not exceed mine for
                  yours."</p>
               <p>"If you don't take good care of my brother, Floy, you and I will quarrel as Mrs.
                  Gray and Mrs. Green used to."</p>
               <p>"What shall I say to you about taking care of my worthy cousin, you saucy
                  sprite?"</p>
               <pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6333-00000159"/>
               <p>"I'll give you liberty to scold me, whenever you think I need it, Floy."</p>
               <p>"I'll remember that; but don't you believe that George Crandall and Fanny Waters
                  are on the high road to matrimony?"</p>
               <p>There'll be a double swapping of brothers and sisters at Portland and Oregon City
                  before long."</p>
               <p>"We know now," Herbert observed, "how it was that Eliza Crandall always discovered
                  so much about what was occurring among the residents of the two cities. Hugh and
                  Fanny always supplied her with the news. How I pity married men!" he exclaimed, as
                  Florence gave his whiskers a wicked pull, which was followed by an amusing
                  scuffle.</p>
               <p>"I command the peace!" said Maurice.</p>
               <p>'Now listen!" exclaimed his wife and with a silvery laugh. Maurice is
                     '<emph>Squire,</emph> and wants you all to know it."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and I'll fine you for contempt of court."</p>
               <p>I'll pay the fine."</p>
               <p>"Let's see you."</p>
               <p>She bounded into his lap, giving him a saucy kiss, accompanied by a box on the
                  ear. "Now! I <emph>said</emph> I'd pay it!"</p>
               <p>"Come, ladies," said Herbert, rising, "Tom is out here with the horses, and we can
                  have a ride."</p>
               <p>Oregon ladies are generally practised equestrians. Ada left her children with her
                  father-in-law and was free as the rest. Effie was mounted first.</p>
               <p>"Good bye, Hubert!" and waving her pocket handkerchief, she bounded away upon her
                  graceful steed, who seemed to know that his fair rider gave him no discredit.</p>
               <p>"You can't leave me," said Ada, with a peculiar chuck to Flaxy, who though getting
                  old in years, was young as his mistress, in high glee she darted past the company
                  and was soon waving her handkerchief in Rocker's eyes, who exerted himself to do
                  double duty, not fancying Flaxy's near approach proach, and for fifteen minutes
                  the almost even race continued. At length, the road left the prairie, taking a
                  course through a dense fir forest. They did not wish to get lost from their
                  would-be escorts, and reined up the horses to wait for them.</p>
               <p>"Here they are! Why, ladies! what circus have you left?" said Hubert, as he came
                  up, in admiration of Effie's skill in horseback-riding.</p>
               <p>"The circus of the prairies, at your service, sir," she replied, pointing to the
                  plain through which they had almost flown. "Where's Herbert and Floy?"</p>
               <p>"Here they all come," said Ada. "Which way shall we go, Maurice?"</p>
               <p>"If we follow the road through the timber, it will lead us to an exposed mountain
                  side, where we will have a view which will repay us for the trouble."</p>
               <p>Their progress through the timber was necessarily slow. They rode more than an
                  hour before they reached the mountain's base, and the ascent was somewhat
                  difficult. When they reached the table-land to which Maurice had guided them, the
                  sky had become so completely overcast with clouds, that the view of distant
                  mountains they had hoped to get, was obscured. A hard shower came, however to the
                  rescue, and when its half hour's work was done, the heaviest cloud bore away to
                  the east, leaving gorgeous piles of dark, purple and golden ones, boiling up
                  majestically in the sun-illumined west. Herbert, who, as the reader has seen, had
                  a great taste for repeating appropriate poetry that he had somewhere read, drew
                  Florence to his side, under a sheltering fir, and repeated, dramatically: <q>

                  pine,' in Oregon, dearie. But the days that are gone, and your mother's fireside,
                  you cannot recall, here or elsewhere. Do you really desire to go back to your
                  native home?"</p>
               <p>"Not now. I love <emph>somebody</emph> better now than my native land, but I have
                  wished that vain wish a thousand times."</p>
               <p>But where was Effie? She had taken a small book from Hubert's pocket, and while
                  the others were talking of the storm, she was writing of it, while sitting upon a
                  rock by Hubert's side, sheltered by an overjutting cliff. Maurice and Ada were
                  standing a little apart from them, watching the changing clouds and diversified
                  scenery, in sympathetic love of the beautiful.</p>
               <p>"Well, I'll give it up! Here is a married pair who have had opportunities to
                  quarrel every day for more than six years and the honey-moon hasn't waned yet!"
                  said Herbert.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Ada, "we are happy. We have toiled together for our daily bread, have
                  known parents' solicitude for precious little ones, have lived in adversity and
                  prosperity, and have never had an angry dispute. We have a pleasant part to
                  contemplate and look forward to the future with as much pleasant anticipation as
                  you do. This is putting a bright face upon matrimonial life, but where folks are
                  properly mated, it's a true one."</p>
               <p>"You can prove all this by me," said Maurice, with a smile.</p>
               <p>"Effie, what are you writing?" Ada had just discovered what she was doing.</p>
               <p>"You can see for yourself." Ada took the book and read: <q>

               <p>"Let me look at that, if you please." Maurice glanced at the composition a few
                  moments, then read it aloud. "That will do, beauty. I see by the quotations that
                  you don't claim credit for what is not your own. Why don't you sometimes get your
                  poems printed?"</p>
               <p>"Because I dread it. The most peaceful way to live, is to keep out of the
                  newspapers."</p>
               <p>"Sister, it seems to me that the good Book says 'Let your light shine.'"</p>
               <p>"Somebody would blow it out, if I should."</p>
               <p>"You'd have that risk to run."</p>
               <p>"But I shan't run it. I write, for I cannot <emph>help</emph> it, but my<pb
                     n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6333-00000161"/> work shall not be published while I
                  live, unless I write without a signature for the 'Oregon Magazine.' Ada, when will
                  that enterprise be a reality?"</p>
               <p>"It depends upon circumstances. We must know what we can do before we rush into
                  such an undertaking. I may not get it to going for a year or two. Certainly not,
                  unless I can publish a periodical equal to any ladies' magazine in the East, and
                  at their prices. Western folks pay too highly for printed matter. No wonder they
                  send to the States for so many papers and magazines, when one dollar there will
                  purchase as much as five will here."</p>
               <p>But western papers never have wide enough circulation to pay expenses, if the
                  rates are not high."</p>
               <p>"Let them give as much as good reading for the money as eastern editors give, and
                  we'll see if their circulation is not rapidly extended. They blame the people; I
                  blame the press."</p>
               <p>"And you are right." said Hubert. "My father takes a dozen eastern publications,
                  and gets them for less money than three Oregon papers would cost; and the
                  difference in the amount of reading matter is more than one half. It is true that
                  expenses of paper, printing, &amp;c., are higher in the west, but not so much so,
                  as to make all this difference in the prices."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Ada, "we have worn this matter threadbare; let's go home. Flora and
                  Henry will think the time long," and suiting the action to the word, she mounted
                  Flaxy, who was champing the but in his eagerness to go.</p>
               <p>They called upon Mrs. Welden, as they returned. She was sitting in the portico,
                  engaged in sewing, while Celia was reading aloud from a new publication, in which
                  mother and daughter were alike interested.</p>
               <p>"O, Meggie!" said Ada, as she alighted, "you ought to have gone with us. We were
                  in a most refreshing storm, and after that was over, the splendid view of gorgeous
                  clouds, snow-crowned mountains, and wide-spread valleys and forests, was most
                  enchanting."</p>
               <p>"I should have gone, but I have lonely freaks, when company is almost intolerable.
                  Such a spell crossed me to-day and I felt as though I could not enjoy the
                  excursion."</p>
               <p>"You mustn't be unhappy, Meggie."</p>
               <p>"I am far from that; but I am sometimes a little dull."</p>
               <p>Howard had built the kitchen fire, and Mrs. Welden arose to prepare tea.</p>
               <p>"No, don't think of such a thing. Father and the children will be looking for us.
                  I told the children that I would be at home before tea, and I never break a
                  promise with them."</p>
               <p>Some refreshments in the form of apples, pie and cake could not be refused, and
                  after a half hour's pleasant chat, the equestrians took their departure.</p>
               <p>"This country is an excellent place for poor folks if they have thrift enough to
                  manage anywhere," said Herbert, when commenting upon the widow's success.</p>
               <p>"Why don't she get married, Mrs. Stanton? She is beautiful, accomplished and good.
                  It's strange that some lucky customer has not carried off the prize before now,"
                  Hubert remarked thoughtfully.</p>
               <p>"She doesn't remain single from want of opportunities to marry. Her union with her
                  husband was rather unhappy until the last month of his life, and she looks forward
                  to a future meeting, saying they will understand each other in Paradise. Whether
                  her theory is correct or not, I don't pretend to say, but she is conscientious in
                  it, and that, I suppose is sufficient."</p>
               <p>"I know a man who would just suit her," observed Herbert.</p>
               <p>"Let a newly-married man alone for making matches," laughed Maurice.</p>
               <pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6333-00000162"/>
               <p>"When you get to Heaven won't you want to see your friends there?"</p>
               <p>"Most certainly. But I shall desire them to choose their own locations."</p>

               <p>"I WISH you a happy visit," said Ada, as the quartette mounted their restless
                  steeds, bound for a trip to the mountains.</p>
               <p>"O, Ada!" replied Effie, pushing her pretty riding-hat to one side of her
                  fairly-like head, and peeping from behind her breeze-tossed ringlets, "I do wish
                  you were going with us! We have been troubling you with our presence for more than
                  a week, and now we are going off upon a tour that you can't enjoy."</p>
               <p>"Birdie," looking archly at her lovely friend, "if you say another word about
                     <emph>trouble,</emph> you and I will quarrel, 'that's a fact.' I
                     <emph>shall</emph> enjoy the trip, for I will often think of the pleasure you
                  are seeing."</p>
               <p>They parted with their friend, and proceeded to short distance, when they met
                  Maurice. He had been to see the wife of Silas ill, who for weeks had not been
                  expected to live. She had adopted Ada's mode of life during the early part of
                  summer, and for a while, all had been well; but her husband began to think that so
                  much out-door "play," as he called it, was useless, and as she not longer
                  complained of the racking pain in her side, he had ceased to be attentive about
                  the children. Harvest time brought a dozen men to cook for; the weather was hot
                  and the baby fretful. Before harvest was over, she had worked herself into a
                  dangerous fever, and for two months, eschewing Maurice's advice, she has been
                  taking medicines prescribed by Dr. Stanton. She arose from the bed of sickness
                  with diseased lungs and worn out constitution. For a while she resumed her duties,
                  but was compelled to give up again, and for a fortnight her death had been daily
                  expected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Query. Does it cost as much to hire a cook as to pay a doctor? Or
                  will all the hoarded gains of a lifetime atone for the suicide of a mother? What
                  will it profit a man if he raises hundreds of acres of grain and loses his wife,
                  or how will the vacancy be filled when she has departed?</p>
               <p>The doctor had been sent for in the night, and as he had not returned, Maurice had
                  gone at dawn to see if they needed assistance. The invalid was in a death stupor,
                  and Maurice was returning homeward to inform Ada of the looked for decease of her
                  neighbor, when he met the gay quartette.</p>
               <p>"What news, Mr. Stanton?"</p>
               <p>"The worst. I am going to make an entry in my diary of 'another victim to
                  over-work!'"</p>
               <p>"Is she so far gone?" Florence asked.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry, no, <emph>glad</emph> to say that she is."</p>
               <p>"Why, Mr. Stanton!"</p>
               <p>"I <emph>am</emph> glad; <emph>fact!</emph> For her life has been a constant scene
                  of toil and suffering, and she'll rest when in the grave. She says that death has
                  no terrors."</p>
               <p>"We ought to stay, Fly, and see if we can't be of service to them," said Effie,
                  forgetting her anticipated pleasure in the hope of doing good.</p>
               <p>"It isn't necessary. Her mother and enough of kin-folks to nurse her to death are
                  there now."</p>
               <pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6333-00000163"/>
               <p>"I must see her," interrupted Hubert. "Was her name Peggy Norris, before
                  marriage?"</p>
               <p>"I believe so; they were married about four years ago. Silas had been a bachelor
                  neighbor to us before that time."</p>
               <p>"That girl lived a year at our house as a domestic," pursued Hubert. "I remember
                  her as a healthy looking, awkward child, who was willing to do whatever she could,
                  but was so ignorant about work that my step-mother finally bade her leave the
                  house. She afterwards lived with Mrs. Clinton, who kept her until her father, who
                  was a machinist in the city, moved on a farm. I wonder if she will know me."</p>
               <p>The short ride of two miles was soon completed, and the party halted at the stile.
                  Hubert alone entered the house, shirking it best for Mrs. Hill not to see the
                  strangers.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Hill; Peggie; do you know me?"</p>
               <p>The invalid had momentarily awakened from the death lethargy and was gazing with a
                  mother's fondness upon her babe.</p>
               <p>"O, Hubert Munson!" she gasped as he took her hand." "Have you come to see me die?
                  I little thought when I saw you last, that in this time I would be as you see me
                  now. Silas says you are married. O, Hubert! take care of your wife, for a if of
                  suffering is before her at best."</p>
               <p>She stopped exhausted, and Hubert, no longer able to bear the scene without tears,
                  turned silently away. He said but little during he forenoon' ride. Occasionally,
                  when Effie, in her winning way, would ride close to his side and utter some
                  endearing word, he would press her hand and say something equally affectionate,
                  but his thoughts were with that morning scene, and when he looked at his
                  rosy-checked darling, fair as the fairest lilly, and blushing as the sweetest
                  rose, fancy would picture her in that dying mother's place.</p>
               <p>"Marriage is something very important, dearie. I used to boast that ladies thought
                  fifty times of matrimony where to boast that ladies thought fifty times of
                  matrimony where it once entered the minds of men, but I don't blame them so much
                  for it now. There is a risk to run when a dependent creature trusts herself,
                  happiness, life, I've, everything, in the power of a husband, that few consider
                  properly."</p>
               <p>"Whether I 'considered it properly' or nor, I think I made a good selection," said
                  she, gazing into his eyes with an affectionate smile.</p>
               <p>Herbert and Florence rode ahead, gaily and happily, as they felt. As they had not
                  seen the dying woman, they had no lasting serious thoughts about her.</p>
               <p>"I wonder if that is Farmer Gray's house?" said Herbert.</p>
               <p>"I guess so; the house looks just like him, and his folks do. I wonder if Polly's
                  boys will have clean faces?"</p>
               <p>"We had better wait here for Hubert and Effie. They are as steady as clock work,"
                  Herbert said, as they reined up under a huge fir tree, out of sight of the house.
                  They were soon overtaken. "What are you waiting for, brother?"</p>
               <p>"For Birdie and her cavalier. Here is Farmer Gray's house, I am certain."</p>
               <p>"How do you know it is?"</p>
               <p>"Don't you see that old-fashioned well-sweep, and hear the spinning wheel?"</p>
               <p>"It <emph>does</emph> look decidedly Grayish. If we are not near there, we ought
                  to be, for I am very tired."</p>
               <p>"They'll hear us talking," said Florence in a warning tone.</p>
               <p>They dashed up to the door in Oregonian style and found as they had conjectured,
                  the abode of their rustic friends, who had been expecting them for an hour.</p>
               <p>"Well, la! bless us! Effie, yer cheeks looks' most <emph>too</emph> rosy? I don't
                  b'lieve ye can stand the fatigue of a twenty mile ride like' Erbert's wife can,"
                  said Mrs. Gary, patting her flushed cheeks and loosing her had and
                  riding-habit.</p>
               <p>"I feel very tired, but hope I'll get used to such rides before long. I lived in
                  the city too long. We never thought<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC6333-00000164"/> of
                  riding over four or five miles there. I have a severe headache."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gray begged her to lie down, and she reluctantly consented to go up stairs
                  and try to sleep. Hubert saw her safely ensconced in Charlie Graves' bed-room.
                  "Now, pet, when you have slept an hour, your may get up. But you must rest while
                  that headache lasts. Are you subject to such attacks?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; I have been ever since I lived at your father's. I believe I caught it from
                  the constant inhalation of camphor and ammonia."</p>
               <p>"I wish I had removed you from there before I went abroad."</p>
               <p>"Don't reproach yourself for it, dear. I'll be better presently." He kissed her
                  fevered check and went below.</p>
               <p>A substantial dinner was served in the kitchen, to which the visitors paid ample
                  justice. Florence soon became well acquainted with the family, and her inspiriting
                  conversation speedily engaged the admiration of her host and hostess, though they
                  had declared upon the wedding day that she was "too proud to notice common folks,"
                  an epithet, which to Mrs. Gray's imagination, implied a good deal that was
                  bad.</p>
               <p>"Why don't you have honey suckles, wild roses, and morning-glories growing around
                  your house, Mrs. Gray?" she asked, as they were inspecting the various
                  improvements of the door-yard and its vicinity.</p>
               <p>"Joseph says that shade 'll <emph>rot the house down,</emph>" was the reply.</p>
               <p>"I guess I <emph>won't</emph> have no vines a ruinin' of my house. There's
                  Maurice, he's a pretty smart feller in some things, but he exposed a tender spot
                  in his head when he sold off half his land to build a fine house; that's failin'
                  number one. Then them oak trees an' vines 'll rot it down in fifteen years unless
                  he paints it over every other summer. Ye don't catch me sellin' land to pay for a
                  fine house, not I don't intend to have this one <emph>spilt</emph> by
                  shrubbery."</p>
               <p>"I believe Birdie's awake," said Hubert, as he heard a light tread upon the
                  stairs. When she saw him coming to meet her, she withdrew again to the bed-room,
                  inviting him to the open window to look upon a blue-grass meadow surrounding a
                  little pond, where scores of ducks and geese were at play. The balmy October
                  breeze played upon her cheeks and she looked the image of spiritual beauty, as she
                  sat silently in her husband's arms, watching the playful maneuvers of the aquatic
                  fowls.</p>
               <p>"How would you like to live as these farmers do, dear?"</p>
               <p>If I had not ideality, I should enjoy it well enough, perhaps; but in my eye,
                  there is no much to live for besides what we eat, and the clothes we wear, and the
                  work we do, that I could not be contented with such a life. "Here is Polly with
                  six children. She is happy in her way, but if I had those dirty-faced awkward
                  young ones, and that spinning wheel and loom, I wouldn't live a month—wouldn't
                  want to. She has a constitution like an ox, but was married when but sixteen and
                  the hardship she endures will cut down her strength in the prime—or what ought to
                  be, the prime of life. She doesn't look at it this way, and <q>
                     <l>'Where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise.'</l>
                  </q> "She'll live a few years longer, and then, like Silas Hill, Sam and the
                  children will be left widowed and motherless. He will think the Invisible Hand has
                  bereft him, mourn for her a while, and then marry somebody who will live off
                  Polly's industry."</p>
               <p>"Are you turning prophetess, pet?"</p>
               <p>"It requires no great degree of critical acumen to prophesy that, my dear."</p>
               <p>Florence entered the room. "Do I interrupt a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tete a
                     tete?</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"Not at all, Floy. You are one of those true friends who never interrupt the
                  felicity of a private chat."</p>
               <pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC6333-00000165"/>
               <p>"Thank you, sir; but our hostess wants to know if Birdie won't have a slight
                  repast? She says, and there is more truth than poetry in the assertion, 'that
                  young husbands had a plaguy sight better think of givin' their wives something
                  substantial to eat, than to be feedin' on love an' duck pon's" said she with a
                  roguish laugh.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Look</emph> at the 'pond' and those ducks and geese, Floy," said Effie,
                  interrupting a playful answer that was forming upon Hubert's tongue.</p>
               <p>'I can see those sights without you, sis. You go to the kitchen and eat that
                  delicate dinner. Hubert may go with you, if he'll promise not to eat all the
                  'goodies' himself."</p>
               <p>The dinner had been prepared with care. A piece of chicken broiled to a delicate
                  brown, a piece of toast and a baked apple, from which a pale amber foam was
                  oozing, were set before her, upon the end of the long dining table, which had been
                  covered with a snow-white table-cloth.</p>
               <p>"I hope, Effie, that you can make out a dinner. I told Polly we must have
                  everything nice. I have the nervous headache myself sometimes, an' can't eat like
                  common folks for two days afterwards."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Mrs. Gray. This looks like my mother's work. I've had the headache two
                  or three times every month for several years. I hope life in the country, and
                  cessation of studies will cure me of such attacks."</p>
               <p>Hubert thought of the long years of his desertion, and of the many times she had
                  suffered from these attacks when he could not be with her. Mrs. Gray left the
                  room. "I don't see how you can love me," taking her hand.</p>
               <p>"Why, dear?"</p>
               <p>"Because I neglected you so long."</p>
               <p>"It was not your fault."</p>
               <p>"Yes it was. If it had not been for false pride I would have written you, and
                  ascertained the truth years ago. But I believed you false, notwithstanding your
                  innocent pledge and honest letters, to say nothing of my boasted faith in my
                  chosen one."</p>
               <p>Effie stopped eating, suddenly pressing her hand to her throbbing temples.</p>
               <p>"I fatigue you with my talk, dearest. Come into the other room with me and sit
                  upon the lounge. You can rest that aching head upon my bosom."</p>
               <p>The evening was growing cool, and Mrs. Gray built a cheerful fire. The lounge was
                  set before the broad fireplace, and Effie disposed herself upon it, resting upon
                  her husband's breast. Florence procured a napkin wet with cold spring water, and
                  laid it upon her head.</p>
               <p>"What, Effie! Can't ride from here to Stanton's without gettin' sick? I wouldn't
                  own it, that's a fact," said Farmer Gray, as he and Herbert came in from "staking
                  out" the horses.</p>
               <p>"Hush, Joseph," said the old lady. "The poor child can't eat bekase her head hurts
                  so, an' we want her to rest."</p>
               <p>"I wouldn't give a <emph>snap</emph> for a sick wife," he answered, with a
                  benevolent grin</p>
               <p>The next morning they were on the way to Uncle Willard's, by sunrise. The rapid
                  riding of the day before was exchanged for a more gentle gait on Effie's account,
                  and at noon they reined up in front of Mr. Willard's Corral. His band of cattle
                  had become so large that the said corral was extended over the entire front
                  clearing, and they reached the cabin by letting down two pairs of bars, a business
                  they by no means fancied. Mrs. Willard appeared glad top see Florence, but cast a
                  half shy glance at the other visitors and a weary one towards the children, who
                  had retreated to the chimney corner under the overhanging cliff of newspapers. An
                  infant a few weeks old was sleeping in the cradle. Mrs. Willard was pale, thin,
                  and slovenly. The drudgery and<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6333-00000166"/>
                  suffering of years had worn out her animation by degress, until she now eared
                  nothing about practising what little she knew. The old, smoky cabin was dismally
                  dirty; the children more so. Florence was at first much embarrassed, but as her
                  companions were too well bred to betray surprise or dissatisfaction, she gradually
                  grew more at ease.</p>
               <p>"Where is Uncle Willard?"</p>
               <p>"He's off a huntin'. He'll be in before long. We have to keep six or seven men to
                  help herd the cattle, and they all come into dinner at one o'clock."</p>
               <p>"How old is this baby?"</p>
               <p>"There weeks."</p>
               <p>"And you're doing all this work? Why don't Uncle stay in the house, or hire
                  somebody to help you?"</p>
               <p>"He'd rather hunt. And then he reads when he is in the house, and I have to keep
                  the children away from him. He's either tired of his slave, or he thinks she can't
                  die."</p>
               <p>A few years' experience had evidently taught her a startling truth. Florence
                  wondered that she had never pitied the poor uncultivated creature before. And the
                  disgust they had all felt for the woman when entering the house, gave way to
                  commiseration. Florence and Effie helped her to prepare the dinner. There was not
                  food enough ready for so many, and Florence made biscuits, Effie pared apples and
                  potatoes, and Mrs. Willard pounded a fresh supply of steak.</p>
               <p>"Yonder comes the men," said she, turning to the baby, who was beginning to cry.
                  At Florence's request she sat down with the baby, while she and Effie proceeded to
                  lay the table-cloth and take up the huge plates full of bread, beef, apple sauce
                  and vegetables.</p>
               <p>Gustavus Willard appeared glad to see them. He had been invited to the wedding,
                  but could not leave his possessions to go on a pleasure excursion. They all
                  remarked that affable as he was with them, he did not once deign to notice his
                  children, and the only words addressed to his wife were, "I should think you could
                  do the work yourself, instead of compelling visitors to prepare their own
                  dinners."</p>
               <p>Florence wondered more than ever that she had not thought of the unenviable
                  situation of her Uncle's wife while living with them. Mrs. Willard did not reply,
                  and she answered with spirit, "I should think you'd do the work yourself, 'instead
                  of compelling' your wife to do it, when she ought to be in bed?"</p>
               <p>"That's what I keep her for," he replied 'evidently intending to originate a witty
                  remark.</p>
               <p>"You'll not keep her long at this rate; mind it Uncle."</p>
               <p>"The little work that she accomplishes isn't going to hurt her," he answered
                  impatiently, and Florence said no more, intending to give him a lecture upon the
                  following morning, when they would be ready to return home.</p>
               <p>A light beamed in the ignorant woman's eyes that since her marriage they had
                  seldom emitted.</p>
               <p>When the time for their departure came, she burst into tears and told her friends
                  that life had been such a burden before they came that she had wished herself
                  dead, and now she would feel worse than ever.</p>
               <p>Hubert asked Mr. Willard to accompany them for a few miles, as they would like to
                  see his valley land. With a feeling of pride, he piloted the quartette around his
                  handsome prairie grounds.</p>
               <p>"Why don't you <emph>live</emph> here? You are amply able to move into the valley
                  and fit up in style."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Munson; you know my wife; you know her to be a coarse, ignorant woman, and if
                  I should move out of the mountains and begin to live like a white man, the sight
                  of her would be insupportable.</p>
               <p>"You have come to the wrong man to get sympathy, Mr. Willard. Though you did wrong
                  to marry that child, even<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6333-00000167"/> if you had
                  gained a kingdom by the alliance, you do still worse to keep her living as you do.
                  She has a soul to save and a heart with which to love. Do you ever tell her that
                  you love her in return for all the toil and pain she endures for you?"</p>
               <p>"I'm not in the habit of uttering falsehoods."</p>
               <p>"Do you ever tell her that she is bound for eternity?"</p>
               <p>"She would not understand it, if I should."</p>
               <p>"Do you ever treat her as an equal?"</p>
               <p>"Why do you ask?"</p>
               <p>"I have noticed that you consider yourself a superior being and regard her as a
                  slave. Pardon my plainness, but as you have made known your case to me, I must
                  tell you of the exact location of the malady before I prescribe. I believe she
                  would outweigh you now, in the scale of worth. If she were a squaw or a negress, I
                  would pity her more than you."</p>
               <p>"This is a broad and bold assertion."</p>
               <p>"And a true one. She works like a slave that you may live in comparative idleness;
                  she bears you numerous children; she studies your most trivial wants, and
                     <emph>loves</emph> you with unrequited affection. Now, tell me, would you have
                  taken a refined and intelligent girl into those mountains and kept her there as
                  you have this one? A slave—a worse than slave?"</p>
               <p>"Of course I wouldn't; but she knows of nothing better."</p>
               <p>"And you do; therefore you are most of blame."</p>
               <p>"What would you have me to do?"</p>
               <p>"Sell off a large drove of cattle, take the money and expend it in building and
                  furnishing a good house in the prairie, and fix up a handsome farm. Hire somebody
                  to take care of those children and teach them manners until they are old enough to
                  attend school. Take pains to teach your wife and elevate her mind. <emph>Love
                     her,</emph> cherish and comfort and protect her, as you vowed before God and
                  man to do, and you need not long be ashamed to introduce acquaintances to 'Mrs.
                  Willard.'"</p>
               <p>"If I had begun this when we were married, I might have succeeded; but it is too
                  late to begin now."</p>
               <p>It is never too late to do good, my dear sir."</p>
               <p>Mr. Willard went home an humbled man, with good resolves beginning to form in his
                  breast. He actually nursed the baby while his wife washed the dinner dishes, and
                  then brought two pails of water from the spring without being asked, and when his
                  wife, encouraged with this unlooked for aid, came out of the kitchen attired in a
                  clean dress and a collar that Florence had presented, he kissed her fervently.</p>
               <p>A hard day's ride brought the tourists to Oregon City, where Mr. Munson had
                  prepared a fashionable banquet in honor of the nuptials of his son and neice.</p>
               <p>Unavoidabel business bad kept him from the wedding, which his wife was unwilling
                  to attend. He had ruled about a complimentary feast, and Mrs. Munson, with whose
                  real character few were acquainted, treated her husband's relatives with apparent
                  graciousness.</p>
               <p>A week later, and the quartette were in their new home. A gothic cottage with
                  venetian blinds and trellised portico, too recently built to be vine-covered,
                  adorned a gentle eminence in sight of Valley Brook. The rich, unpretending
                  furniture of the various apartments and the elaborate hangings of the arched
                  windows threw a shade of luxury around the beautiful dwelling, which was reflected
                  upon the glowing faces of the four happy inmates, rendered brighter still by the
                  ruddy blazes of the cheerful parlor fire around which they sat and sang, read and
                  chatted.</p>

               <p>HUBERT'S COTTAGE was finished and furnished complete by the following July. Effie
                  was delighted with there new abode. The country air and out-door exercise had
                  given her perfect health, which she well knew how to appreciate.</p>
               <p>She had been installed for a week in her new home, when upon a warm, sultry
                  afternoon. Mrs. Welden, Mrs. Stanton, and Florence, paid her a surprise visit.</p>
               <p>"I have a whole catalogue of news and some little gossip for your entertainment,"
                  said Florence, at the tea-table, when Maurice, Hubert, and Herbert were present.
                  "You remember Miss Martin. She is to be one of our neighbors."</p>
               <p>'Indeed; I had not heard it. It she married? Where is she going to live?" Ada
                  asked, as though excited.</p>
               <p>"You seem very anxious to know," replied Florence.</p>
               <p>"Simply because I was interested in her. I wanted to gain her confidence for I am
                  certain that a well-spring of her inner being has either been wasted upon an
                  unworthy object or that she has been the victim of circumstances.</p>
               <p>"The latter supposition is right. I would not abuse her confidence, but to
                  reconcile you to an announcement that may surprise you, I will read you a letter
                  of hers that I received to-day."</p>

                              <salute>"Dear Pupil and Friend:—</salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>I am coming to live near you. I have studied a dozen ways to break the
                              news 'gently,' but at last it has dropped from my pen, just as you see
                              it: <emph>Willis Stokes is dead.</emph> I received the intelligence a
                              few months since in an Eastern newspaper. I will not comment further
                              upon that circumstance at present. It is a relief to know of a
                              certainty what has become of the object of 'love's young dream.'
                              'Where will you live?' I hear you ask. Do you know Mr. Silas Hill?
                              Don't start and object and say 'he worked his wife to death,' and a
                              dozen other disparaging things. He needs a wife, and needs a mother
                              for those helpless little ones. 'He might have had a wife if he had
                              taken care of her!' I hear you say, indignantly. Now don't be rash. He
                              has come to me and said the same himself, with the sincerity of
                              deepest regret. She was a thorough-going woman, too much so for her
                              strength, and he was <emph>thoughtless,</emph> not <emph>cruel.</emph>
                              I blame him it is true, but can forgive him, for I believe he is
                              penitent. A true marriage, as I told you once, is not for me. I can be
                              useful in the life I have chosen; can think well enough of my husband
                              to live with him agreeably, and my yearning heart has so long sought
                              something to love that those pretty bright-eyed children already seem
                              as near to me as though they were my own. God helping me, they shall
                              never know the want of a mother's love. There will be some scandal, a
                              nine day's wonder, and any amount of curiosity about the match, but I
                              don't care. As Mrs. Stephens says, 'I have lived long enough to fear
                              nothing that is.'—</p>

               <p>"This is an age of progress," interrupted Effie. "I've heard of marrying for love,
                  for a home, for beauty, for money, but the idea of marrying for the sake of a
                  widower's children, is something new under the sun."</p>
               <p>"That clears the mystery," said Ada. "Silas has been building additions to his
                  house, and has furnished it tastefully. I suspected that a match was brewing, but
                  had I been trying to select his bride, Miss Martin is the last person I should
                  have guessed."</p>
               <p>"Read this, Floy," said Herbert, handing her a copy of the Oregon ——, and pointing
                  to a paragraph—</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"MARRIED:—Upon the 3d inst., at the house of the bride's father, by the Rev.
                     ——, Mr. Hugh Waters, of Portland, to Miss Eliza Crandall, of Oregon City. Also,
                     on the evening of the same day, by the same, Mr. George Crandall of Oregon
                     City, to Miss Fanny Waters of Portland.</p>
               </q>
               <p>"I wonder why we were not invited. I don't care for the weddings, but don't fancy
                  the slight." Florence was angry. 'I don't see why they should slight us, when they
                  were our bridesmaids."</p>
               <pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC6333-00000169"/>
               <p>Herbert drew a letter from his pocket. "Here Floy, this will tell you about it.
                  She opened the letter and glanced at the contents.</p>
               <p>"This is too bad!"</p>
               <p>"What, Floy?" said Effie, as she looked over here shoulder. "Why this letter
                  should have been received a week ago. We were all so cordially invited, and they
                  will think our absence was intentional. I should have been so glad to have been
                  there."</p>
               <p>"O, well; we'll not fret over it, sister. But who is coming?" A carriage was
                  winding slowly up the avenue.</p>
               <p>"It's Silas Hill!" said Ada. He went below a week ago, and I see he has a new
                  carriage. Meggie, ours have come into port, for they were all to come together
                  from the East."</p>
               <p>"He isn't alone, is he? There is Miss Martin, or as I must call her, Mrs. Hill,
                  now," and Florence ran to the gate."</p>
               <p>They alighted a few moments, and then drove away, promising to visit them all,
                  after they first had been called upon.</p>
               <p>A week passed and the carriages were received. The four families prepared for a
                  ride to Silas Hill's; Florence, Effie, and their husbands going on horseback,
                  while Mrs. Welden's family, and Maurice's, gave their new carriages "the
                  christening ride." Howard Welden, now a noble boy of twelve years, drove his
                  mother's ponies, with the pride and dignity of a nabob.</p>
               <p>Well might the mother be proud of her children whom she had supported through
                  years of privation and toil, and who, when prosperity had dawned upon her days of
                  widowhood, was permitted still to enjoy their society, respect and affection. She
                  had not been able to live in the style which Maurice and Ada had adopted, but the
                  neatness and comfort everywhere visible about her little farm, her friends told
                  her looked as well as their own more ostentatious style. Her heart beat with
                  gratitude to the giver of these blessings, and the hymn of praise and prayer of
                  thanksgiving ascended regularly from the home altar to the throne of God. Little
                  Johnny, the native of a log cabin and offspring of poverty was the general
                  favorite.</p>
               <p>The greatest ambition of the family had been satisfied when the family carriage,
                  which mother and children had alike striven to earn, was obtained. When they all
                  neared the newly painted and furnished home of Silas Hill, they were pleased with
                  the sight of three neatly clad, pretty children, playing in the verandah.</p>
               <p>"I'll give it up," said Maurice to his wife. "Miss Martin had a noble work to do.
                  Silas might have had everything comfortable in his first wife's time, if he had
                  thought so, and she had insisted upon it. He seldom originates an idea, but yields
                  readily to the influence of others."</p>
               <p>The children's faces were clean, an unusual occurrence in their worm out, sick
                  mother's day. Ada stopped to caress them, and the new Mrs. Hill came out to meet
                  them with pleasant words and happy smiles. Silas was called in from his work in
                  the orchard. He came with a cleanly shaven face, and arrayed in decent clothes,
                  which were as new to Maurice and Ada as was the tidy appearance of the children.
                  Silas talked much about his first wife; appeared very sorrowful about the course
                  he had allowed her to pursue, but slightly excused himself on the ground of
                  ignorance. Miss Martin's "withered heart" had found objects to love in the little
                  children, and she was contented, if not happy.</p>
               <p>A carriage rumbled at the gate. Effie was sitting in the verandah, playing with
                  the children. She looked up as the vehicle stopped, and saw a boy of apparently
                  twelve years of age, jump to the ground. He was at her side in a half moment.</p>
               <p>"Effie, do you know me?"</p>
               <pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC6333-00000170"/>
               <p>"Jamie Clinton! can this be you?"</p>
               <p>"You better believe it is! I told ma we'd find you, certain."</p>
               <p>"Where have you been for so long?"</p>
               <p>"O, you see we got home from New York last week, and ma called to see Mrs. Munson.
                  She told her that you had married, and I teased her and pa till they brought me to
                  see you. We couldn't find you at your cottage, but I thought we were on your
                  track."</p>
               <p>The impulsive boy was standing with his arm round her neck, and she was almost
                  weeping for joy. Mrs. Clinton watched the scene with pleasure.</p>
               <p>"Did you <emph>ever?</emph> I had forgotten everybody else but Jamie," Effie
                  exclaimed, as she jumped down the steps and ran to meet her friends in the
                  carriage.</p>
               <p>A hurried explanation of their long absence followed.—They had remained in New
                  York until Mrs. Clinton's father was dead, and had returned on account of her
                  health. Mrs. Clinton dreaded the journey either by land or water, but having tried
                  both, she preferred the water route as being more expeditious, not so fatiguing,
                  and no more dangerous than the overland journey. They returned home with Hubert
                  and Effie, and for three days they were welcome guests. The visit then came to a
                  close, and with many promises of future intimacy, they parted in pleasant
                  spirits.</p>
               <p>"I wonder, Floy, why your uncle doesn't visit us?" said Hubert, one afternoon,
                  just after harvest. "I hear that he has built him a new house, hired a domestic
                  (isn't that singular?) engaged a governess for his children, and begun to create
                  his wife as an equal. I saw Hugh Waters to-day, and he told me that he had been at
                  his house and found this true."</p>
               <p>"I wrote last week, inviting them to visit us, but don't suppose uncle will think
                  he can spare the time for a visit."</p>
               <p>"You're mistaken," said Effie, rising, "for they are coming now."</p>
               <p>Sure enough, there was a two-horse spring wagon full of juvenile faces, each
                  trying to outgaze the other in their eagerness to see their relatives. Mrs.
                  Willard had improved in person and address. Her health had become comparatively
                  good, and her children were tidy and polite. Mr. Willard was sincere in his thanks
                  to Hubert for the task he had assumed in awakening him to a sense of duty.</p>
               <p>"I told you that your wife would be no disagree to you, if you would discharge
                  your duty as well as she did hers. I pity the mountaineers who married squaws when
                  there were no white women here, much more than I pity those who married children
                  to save a half section of land."</p>
               <p>"I tell you, Munson, a half section of beautiful prairie, joining a bachelor's
                  half of the best of timber, looked very tempting, though I acknowledge that if I
                  had been living among genteel people, I would have scorned the idea of marrying to
                  secure it. I was little better than a savage myself, before I saw you"</p>
               <p>Effie took Mrs. Willard's eldest children home with her, and Florence and her aunt
                  were enjoying a private chat.</p>
               <p>"Gustravus began to treat me better after you was there last fall. I don't pretend
                  to say he ever was cross, but he didn't used to care how much I suffered, or how
                  hard I worked. Now, he won't let me sell any more butter, and keeps a man and
                  woman hired to do the hard work. And we have got the loveliest girl to teach the
                  children and help me sew. He says he'll get me a sewing machine next summer. We go
                  to church every Sunday, and I am just commencing to live."</p>
               <p>It was evening in Herbert's cottage home, and Maurice, Ada, Mrs. Welden, Hubert
                  and Effie had assembled to spend the evening there, attracted by two new pianos,
                  belonging to Effie and Florence, which had been received and carried first to
                  Herbert's house, that their respective merits could be tested when together. The
                  music was sounding its sweetest, when a loud "woa" was heard in the highway.
                  Farmer Gray was going to the city to sell butter and eggs, and made it convenient
                  upon such occasions to visit his friends.</p>
               <p>"I thought may-be ye'd like to hear from Ike Hammond. I got a letter from Tom
                  Simmons, the old woman's brother, and' he says that the rascal is dead, and his
                  still-house burnt<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC6333-00000171"/> down, and his wife
                  run away, and the children bound out." This was the first news of the old
                  homestead that the brother and sister had had for years.</p>
               <p>"God forgive me for the way I hated that man!" said Herbert, with emotion. The
                  remembrance of old scenes caused Effie to sigh, and lean her head upon her
                  hand.</p>
               <p>"An' there's suthin' else. There's going to be a big emigration acrost the Plains
                  next summer. I wish I had that trip to go again. I'd leave the Missouri by the
                  fifteenth of April, an' take good healthy fodder along an' show folks that
                  crossin' the Plains is no hazardous trick at all, if they'll have any sense about
                  fixin' for it an' startin; early. The reason folks was sick so much when we
                  crossed was' cause the buffler was all skeered from the road an' it was hog meat
                  from beginnin' to end. An' then folks started so late that so many cattle starved,
                  and the stench of dead oxen was enough to kill skunks. If they'd strike out by the
                  middle of April, grass of no grass, they'd strike out by the middle of April,
                  grass or no grass, they'd <emph>find it</emph> in a few day's travel, an' a
                  hundred or two miles along 'll be a good deal in a emigrant's favor this side o'
                  Fort Hall."</p>
               <p>"The gold excitement here and hard times in the States will cause many to
                  undertake the journey, and I apprehend no danger at all from Indians if the
                  emigration is large. The eastern papers all contain horrible accounts of Indian
                  outbreaks, but if the editors knew how few of their awful communications are true,
                  they'd learn to swallow them like we do gold news. I have no doubt but that gold
                  mines of value exist in the British Possessions and other places much nearer to
                  us, but the stories of collecting it by handsfull, are all humbug," said
                  Herbert.</p>
               <p>"That's sense, boy. But I want to hear some o' that music. Of course I think
                  pianers is all nonsense, but I don't mind to hear from 'em once in a while."</p>
               <p>Florence was seated at her instrument, carelessly and lightly drumming the keys.
                  When Farmer Gray spoke of wishing to hear music, she involuntarily struck the tune
                  of "My Mother's Grave." As if an unseen spirit possessed her, she broke forth in
                  singing: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"I love to stay where my mother sleeps,</l>
                        <l>And gaze on each star as it twinkling peeps,</l>
                        <l>Through that bending willow which lonely weeps,</l>
                        <l>O'er my mother's grave; o'er my mother's grave,</l>
                        <l>Through that bending willow, o'er my mother's grave.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"I love to kneel on the green turf there,</l>
                        <l>Afar from the scenes of my daily care,</l>
                        <l>And breathe to my Savior my evening prayer,</l>
                        <l>O'er my mother's grave; o'er my mother's grave;</l>
                        <l>Through that bending willow; o'er my mother's grave.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"I well remember how oft she led,</l>
                        <l>And knelt me by her as with God she plead,</l>
                        <l>That I might be His when the clods were spread</l>
                        <l>O'er my mother's grave; o'er my mother's grave.</l>
                        <l>Through that bending willow; o'er my mother's grave.</l>

                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"I love to think how, 'neath the ground,</l>
                        <l>She slumbers in death as a captive bound,</l>
                        <l>She'll slumber no more when the trump shall sound,</l>
                        <l>O'er my mother's grave; o'er my mother's grave;</l>
                        <l>Through that bending willow; o'er my mother's grave."</l>

               </p>
               <p>The mournful tones of the singer's voice mingled with the clarion strains of the
                  instrument, sounded as a sad, contented wail.</p>
               <p>"I didn't bargain for anything that solemn," said Farmer Gray, "still it sounds
                  glorious."</p>
               <p>The tears, which for a year Effie had scarcely shed at all to her mother's memory,
                  dropped upon her husband's check. Hubert kissed the marble forehead of his wife,
                  who was pale with emotion. A lark, the prince of Oregon songsters, broke out in an
                  entrancing trill of melody while sitting in the branches of an old oak tree that
                  stood near an open window.</p>
               <p>Eyes looked to eyes, while listening, and memory reverted to a distant scene. Mrs.
                  Welden grasped Ada's hand. She was thinking of <emph>another time</emph> when a
                  merry songster had been a comforter, and blessed the mission of the happy
                  bird.</p>
               <p>"This reminds me," said Maurice, "of a poem I noticed in one of our weeklies,
                  to-day. I intended to show it to Ada before, but forgot it until this moment.</p>
               <p>"Who is 'Viola?'" Ada asked, glancing at the signature.</p>
               <p>"A lady whose only fault is that she so seldom writes. But the poem—Oregon
                  literature is beginning to look up and whenever I see signs of its elevation, I
                  get deeply interested." Ada took the journal and read it aloud: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>Beauteous child of melody,</l>
                        <l>Singing from out that old oak tree,</l>
                        <l>Perching thyself on the topmost bough,</l>
                        <l>Who can rival thy music now?</l>
                        <pb n="342" xml:id="VAC6333-00000172"/>
                        <l>Scattering song on the morning breeze,</l>
                        <l>Like a shower of rain-drops from the trees,</l>
                        <l>Telling the listener's heart of Spring,</l>
                        <l>Gilding with hope-light everything;</l>
                        <l>Hopping about in the sunny hours,</l>
                        <l>O'er the yard's gay carpet of yellow flowers,</l>
                        <l>Thyself as like thou wert hardly seen,</l>
                        <l>If thy feathers were only tipped with green,;</l>
                        <l>But the russet brown of thy humble wing</l>
                        <l>Is like leaves that grew in a former Spring,</l>
                        <l>They are withered now, and lie scattered round,</l>
                        <l>Enriching and shielding the fruitful ground,</l>
                        <l>And thy coat is so like those dead leaves, sere,</l>
                        <l>That thy voice must tell us when thou art near.</l>
                        <l>Cheerily now thy warblings fall</l>
                        <l>On my list'ning ears, and I treasure them all</l>
                        <l>Up in the choicest nook of my heart,</l>
                        <l>That their gladness and sunshine may never depart.</l>
                        <l>Often I wake in the cool Spring night,</l>
                        <l>And listen to thee with deep delight,</l>
                        <l>Breaking out in a thrill so long,</l>
                        <l>Waking the echoes of midnight hours,</l>
                        <l>Shaking the dew from the sleeping flowers,</l>
                        <l>As if thou wert waking from some bright dream,</l>
                        <l>Or gazing with joy on the moonlit scene.</l>
                        <l>A treasure thou art, of worth untold,</l>
                        <l>Yielding us music that never grows old.</l>
                        <l>But say, sweet lark, why so happy thou art,</l>
                        <l>Why so gay thy song and light thy heart?</l>
                        <l>Why not grieve for plumage more rich and rare,</l>
                        <l>And complain to thy Maker of 'nothing to wear,'</l>
                        <l>How darest thou be seen in the summer light,</l>
                        <l>When so many are dressed in colors more bright?</l>
                        <l>The bird flitted by, but sang as he went</l>
                        <l>'I'm teaching a lesson of sweet content.'</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Ada's earnest voice vibrated musically through the cheerily lighted room. Mrs.
                  Welden sat gazing into the fire, her lips compressed and eyes aglow with
                  feeling.</p>
               <p>Effie's face grew radient. "If we're not happy on this green earth, the Creator
                  can't be blamed," she exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"Well, it's strange what notions folks can conjure up now-a-days. Who'd a thought
                  that anybody would try to draw poetry from a bird's noise? The poets are
                  immortalizin' <emph>everything</emph> in song," said Farmer Gray by way of
                  comment.</p>
