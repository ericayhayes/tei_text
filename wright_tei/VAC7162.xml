            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Reader will find in the following pages a brief but "o'er true tale" of a loving
               woman's deep wrongs. It is the old story—trusting woman and heartless man. Why is it
               ever thus? Will our sex, deceived and deserted as it so often is, never learn wisdom
               from experience?</p>
            <p>Shall the record ever be the same? Will no hand be uplifted to strike the heartless
               betrayer to the earth, or can none of his victims call to her aid the assistance of a
               graphic pen, and while narrating the story of her own wrongs, let them serve as a
               beacon to warn the unsuspecting and innocent maiden of the perils that lurk in the
               path that is avoided by the feet of those who are content to seek happiness in its
               accustomed haunts?</p>
            <p>Finding none ready to vindicate our wrongs, I, a "Hoosier Girl," have essayed the
               task, and trust that my story may serve as a warning to all who are so foolish as to
               "marry in haste and repent at leisure."</p>

                  <head type="sub">MY FIRST SORROW.</head>
                  <p>IT was a sad and gloomy day in midwinter; the heavens were black with frowning
                     clouds, and fast-descending snow-flakes were casting a pure white mantle over
                     the earth. I was then a child, and the gloominess of nature without
                     corresponded well with my sad heart, for death had that day visited our humble
                     abode and clasped in his icy arms the dearest object of my affection.</p>
                  <p>My own dear mother, whose place in the family circle I felt never more could be
                     filled, had that day closed her eyes to all terrestrial things, and was about
                     to be carried to the lone and silent tomb. I did not weep, for there hung a
                     sorrow upon my young heart too oppressive for tears: it was no juvenile
                     bereavement, to be forgotten in a day, but a lasting sorrow.</p>
                  <p>From the day I lost a mother's guiding hand, a mother's sweet counsel, my
                     trials and difficulties accumulated. But the darkest cloud has a silvery edge:
                     I still had a kind and ever-loving father left to guide and protect me, and to
                     him I owe all that hath made life sweet and hopeful upon earth.</p>
                  <p>I was born in Madison, Indiana, the eldest of five children—three sisters and
                     an only brother. At the opening of my story I was ten years of age,<pb
                        n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7162-00000005"/> and so far my life had been all
                     sunshine, all smiles; but a change awaited me—ah, yes! a sad change for me—and
                     in looking back over the past, I could almost wish myself a child again; but it
                     never falls to the lot of mortals here to have perpetual sunshine, for life
                     must be overcast sometimes with dark clouds, and to-night while seated all
                     alone in my room, far from the friends that I love, I am forcibly struck with
                     the thought of how little I knew in my childhood's days of what life was made
                     up.</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE STEP-MOTHER.</head>
                  <p>IT was a bright August morning, when my father ushered in to our home a
                     stepmother. She was beautiful, but cold. She met me courteously; I tried to
                     love her, but I could not.</p>
                  <p>The contrast was so great between her and my mother, that my eyes would fill
                     with tears when the name of mother was pronounced. My own dear mother was ever
                     kind, ever loving, ever ready to lend a helping hand to the distressed. She had
                     a warm, confiding nature that drew every one to her side.</p>
                  <p>My stepmother did not love me—why should I strive longer to love one who
                     repulsed me in every action? As I ripened into womanhood the more cold and
                     distant we became to each other. When we met it was with a cold "Good morning,"
                     and a still more icy "Good night." These meetings were seldom, except in the
                     breakfast-room, for we avoided meeting in the parlor.</p>
                  <p>My father I loved with no common love. He was ever the same kind, loving
                     father; but oh, how it pained his heart to see those that he loved so
                     estranged! Thirteen years have passed since she entered our home; but greater
                     sorrows have I passed through since then. I can brave disappointments now. I
                     ask not from this world a tear—its mocking sympathy I scorn.</p>
                  <p>The world is full of disappointments, and happy are those who do not seek to
                     foresee the future until the providence of God unfolds it to us and gives us
                     grace and strength to endure whatever it may bring. I love to dream over the
                     past, though my life has been strewed with thorns. Yes, it is a melancholy
                     pleasure to think of loving friends at rest—of lights and shadows—for all have
                     had some bright spots in their experience, some kind word and loving friend to
                     remember.</p>

                  <p>IT was a lovely morning in June. Hours pass unheeded, but at length hearts
                     well-nigh hopeless were cheered by a change; and ere the sun had sunk to rest,
                     spirits were made glad—consciousness returned. Pale as marble sat Albert Lilly.
                     He was the only son of a wealthy planter in the State of Louisiana, nursed in
                     luxury and wealth, and upon his introduction to the reader had just returned
                     from a European voyage. I had scarce reached my teens when we first met. We
                     loved, our vows were plighted, and after an absence of three years he returned
                     to claim me as his bride. At that period he fell ill, and his life was
                     despaired of; but at length the fever passed off, and soon we were married and
                     started for his home in the South. We went by railroad as far as St. Louis, and
                     from there by a steamer, which brought us to our sunny home.</p>
                  <p>In my beautiful southern home I thought I should be happy; but alas,
                     disappointment has ever been my lot: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"I never loved a tree or flower,</l>
                           <l>But 'twas the first to fade away."</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>For three months we were happy—oh, how happy! but it was not destined to last.
                     One evening, about six o'clock, a single horseman rode up to the gate,
                     alighted, ascended the steps of our mansion, and rung the bell. How my heart
                     sunk within me when I heard my husband's name pronounced. He was dying. I
                     hastened to his side; but oh, how changed!</p>
                  <p>The death damp was on his brow, but the old familiar and most beautiful smile
                     still hovered about hid lips. The message was delivered none too soon. He was
                     going fast. One gasp, one struggle, and he had safely passed the river of
                     death, and life's heaven was open. I knelt sorrowfully by my husband's corpse,
                     and poured out a prayer for comfort and support in that all-trying hour. Vain
                     is the help of man, and never more truly is this realized than in such dark
                     hours.</p>
                  <p>Great was the excitement in the city of New Orleans when it was known that
                     Albert Lilly had lost his life in a duel.</p>
                  <p>Deep and almost universal sympathy reigned throughout the State.</p>
                  <p>My husband had been insulted by H. Moore, of F——t, Ky., and being a hot-blooded
                     southerner he challenged him and lost his life. I knew nothing of the duel
                     until it was over. He left me that morning as usual for the city.</p>
                  <p>Our house was some five miles from New Orleans, and when the tidings came they
                     fell upon me like a thunderbolt.</p>
                  <p>None can sympathize with or know the deep sorrow that filled my heart, but
                     those that have passed through the same trials. I, a wife and widow at the
                     early age of sixteen summers, could then repeat with the poet: <q>

                  <head type="sub">HAMILTON MOORE.</head>
                  <p>ONE month after my husband's death, Hamilton Moore called and begged an
                     interview—the man that I could not forgive—the man that had murdered my
                     husband.</p>
                  <p>I met him in the parlor, cold but politely; he approached me, took my hand, and
                     began with all the deception he was master of to make love to me. I drew back
                     in astonishment, exclaiming—</p>
                  <p>"Sir, have you come here to insult me? Begone, sir—leave my house this instant,
                     or I will ring for a servant!"</p>
                  <p>"Ring, madam, as quick as it pleases your majesty. I am master here, and have
                     come to offer you my hand and heart. I love you—will make you happy. I own
                     every inch of ground—this house, the furniture and all are mine; I have a
                     mortgage on it that you cannot pay—even the jewels you wear are not yours!"</p>
                  <p>The truth flashed upon me—I was penniless! And I must act. For a moment I stood
                     gazing upon the man I hated, and then bade him a cold good morning.</p>
                  <p>He rushed after me, caught my hand and said—</p>
                  <p>"Act not so madly, I beseech you!"</p>
                  <p>"Sir, sooner would I become the slave of the cruelest taskmaster than become
                        <emph>your willing slave!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"It is not a slave, madam, that I wish to make of you, but a loved and
                     cherished wife. Remember, a rich lover now kneels at your feet!"</p>
                  <p>"There you can kneel, and kiss the ground if you choose."</p>
                  <p>"Do you not know that I have a mortgage on your property?"</p>
                  <p>"True, you say you have a mortgage on my property, but you have none on my
                     person. Unhand me, villain!"</p>
                  <p>He looked into my face with the most perfectly calm composure, and said—</p>
                  <p>"Madam, I have for you a devoted tenderness—I love you with unspeakable love,
                     and desire, above all things, to make you happy."</p>
                  <p>"If you love me, leave this house," I said, for I was becoming alarmed. He
                     retreated a step and said—</p>
                  <p>"I will leave, but a watch will be kept over you. You cannot quit these
                     premises, and ere the sun hath sunk behind the western hills you shall be my
                     bride. I swear it! <emph>I will not be foiled.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Saying these words, and leaving me with a cold shudder, he took his leave. As
                     soon as I could collect my thoughts, I began to look round me, to see what was
                     the best to be done. I called the carriage, and drove off at a rapid rate. When
                     about two miles from the house, six men came up to the carriage and commanded
                     the driver to halt. At that moment a party of gentlemen drove up and saved me.
                     As their number was double that of my assailants, I arrived safely in New
                     Orleans and took the first steamer for home. After a voyage of a week, I stood
                     once more in my father's house—my childhood's home.</p>
                  <p>"We will leave Moore now, and speak of him again. We will pass over two years,
                     during which time I taught a school in the city of ——. At the end of two years
                     I had about three hundred dollars. I had nothing to keep me at home. Two of my
                     sisters were laid in the cold earth, and my oldest sister was married; my
                     brother had gone abroad, and I thought I would travel as long as my money would
                     last.</p>

                  <head type="sub">MY FIRST VISIT TO THE COAST.</head>
                  <p>IT was a beautiful morning in May when I took passage on one of the splendid
                     steamers at Madison, Indiana, bound for Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. How my heart
                     bounded as I gazed on the magnificent scenery on either side of the broad
                     Ohio.</p>
                  <p>We were nearing the port of Cincinnati, when I heard the cry, "Help! help! for
                     God's sake, help!" The life-boat was lowered, and a beautiful young lady was
                     lifted from the water. She was as lovely a creature as I ever met; her dark
                     curls flowed profusely over a neck of snowy whiteness. I learned her name was
                     Maud D——, of Wheeling, Virginia. At that city we left her, and proceeded on our
                     way. Nothing of importance transpired until we landed in Pittsburg, when I
                     found my pockets had been picked—my money was gone. I said nothing, but thought
                     I would keep up appearances as long as possible. I ordered my trunk to be sent
                     to a hotel, for I could proceed on my journey no further without money. At the
                     breakfast table I took up a paper and read "Agents Wanted." I had little
                     difficulty in finding the house. After going through a process of questions,
                     whether I had ever sold a book, who for, and when, I was told that I could have
                     a trial. When I thought all was ready to begin my book-selling, I was told that
                     I must advance thirty dollars. Thus was I met at the very threshold with
                     difficulty. But I bethought myself of a gold watch—my husband's parting
                     gift—that I had refused to part with under all circumstances. I took it to a
                     pawnbroker, pawned it for one-fourth of its value, and expended it for
                     religious books; went out into the community, thinking of nothing but
                     success.</p>
                  <p>I walked three days; talked myself hoarse; sold one book for half what it cost.
                     I went to a minister: he suggested I should exchange them for novels. I did so;
                     it worked like a charm; I visited all the New England States, stopping a day or
                     two in each village disposing of my books. Six months after I went into the
                     book business I had, over expenses, two hundred dollars in my possession. I
                     thought of visiting the South, to gaze once more on my husband's grave. I
                     remained in the South through the winter, when I returned once more to my
                     father in Indiana, where I was received with open arms by that dear, good man.
                     Ah! and to-night, while many hundred miles away, my heart turns to the place I
                     once called home, and yearns for the friends I loved in my childhood days. Oh,
                     happy, happy days of childhood! cheery as the hours of May, they go as do the
                     May days, with their flowers, leaves and songs.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE DEATH OF MY ONLY BROTHER.</head>
                  <p>WE will pass over some years. It is now 1858.</p>
                  <p>Friday, March 19, a calm, beautiful morning, when the Pacific—that beautiful
                     little steamer—hove in sight, and was soon in Portland, Ky. A tall and rather
                     handsome man stepped lightly from the boat, and was seen wending his way to a
                     cottage on the hill-side. He rings—the door is thrown open. Ah! who is it that
                     clasps his hand, and exclaims, "Come at last!" That was my own dear brother and
                     his betrothed; they were seated in the parlor, planning for the future. He
                     arose to leave, but still he lingers. Why is it?—some sad presentiment of evil
                     appears to hover around. What can it be? Was he never more to gaze on her face
                     after his departure? Lizzy arose, passed out of the parlor into her own room,
                     and seated herself by the window, and in five minutes more the whole town was
                     hurrying to the scene of action. A deadly struggle was visible on the pier
                     where the Pacific lay. For one instant the panic-stricken girl stood, and then
                     rushed with horror to the wharf. Heavens and earth! what a sad spectacle met
                     her appalled gaze! It froze the blood in her veins. She saw the one she had
                     parted with a few moments before, dying, a ghastly gash across his breast, and
                     his pale, ashy face in the last agonies of death. "O my God, my God! who hath
                     done this?" she cried. She raised him in her arms—he fell back—he was dead. He
                     only lived one moment. God forgive the man that did it. My brother was murdered
                     by Johnston, of L——, Ky. His body was placed in the vault to await the arrival
                     of his friends; but, alas! we received not that sad intelligence until he had
                     been interred for one week. He was my only brother. We had not met for years.
                     In one week more he was to claim a beautiful bride. Oh the agonies of that
                     dreadful day, when the news reached us.</p>
                  <p>It was Tuesday morning. A single carriage was seen wending its way to the
                     lonely graveyard. One pale woman eat in the carriage that followed the hearse.
                     She was the only mourner present at that sad funeral. Why mourn? Is not death a
                     common doom? We all most die; that argument, though true, is a poor consolation
                     for present grief. If there was aught to love in life, there is something to
                     mourn in death. Speak out sad, mourning heart; one by one we are passing to
                     another world, my friends are all passing away, while I am left to battle with
                     the cold and selfish world. <q>

                  <p>I FELT sad and lonely after parting with so many friends. I thought I would
                     turn any attention to writing, make money, and travel. After writing two
                     months, I put it in the form of a little book, and called it "Liberty or
                     Death." I met with unbounded success. In three months I had made five hundred
                     dollars over expenses. I travelled in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Indiana. I was
                     never more happy in my life. The papers were full of puffs—notices of the
                     "Hoosier girl's" success, the "live Hoosier girl," and so forth. I, of course,
                     felt flattered. I knew it was not the merit of the book, for it was but a
                     common one compared with the literature of the day. I was persevering; I would
                     and must make money. I received invitations to visit cities, villages, and
                     country, and every place of amusement when I arrived. I felt that I was living
                     in another world. I had no time to indulge in melancholy reflections or get
                     lonely; every day found me in a different city or town, selling from two to
                     three hundred copies per day. I visited Pittsburg, Pa., where my sister
                     resided. I was delighted to meet my only sister and her beautiful children.
                     Aby, the eldest, is a sweet little girl of five summers—a dear, darling child.
                     I spent a week in that smoky city, and returned to Ohio, the State that I so
                     much love and admire.</p>
                  <p>It was evening when I arrived in Steubenville, my heart thrilling high with
                     happiness.</p>
                  <p>After tea, I went down to the drawing-room. A gentleman came in and seated
                     himself by the window, and entered into conversation with me. His gentle tones
                     came to me like a spirit borne on angels' wings. I shall never forget that
                     voice while memory lasts. Oh, how my pulse wildly throbbed while listening to
                     the music of his voice!</p>
                  <p>How often, in the hush of solitude, does it visit me; the holy accents, like
                     the low whisperings or distant murmuring of some gentle rill, come stealing
                     sweetly over my heart. Oh, God! had we never met I would have still been happy,
                     for my heart was free. Men are false deceivers; they win, and then cast lightly
                     aside the hearts they have won.</p>
                  <p>For a week I lingered in the place; then taking my leave, visited a distant
                     city, with a promise from my new acquaintance that he would soon follow me. We
                     were <emph>engaged.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>Harry, as I shall henceforth call him, soon followed me, and we were married.
                     He said it would injure the sale of my book, and as I thought so myself, it was
                     kept a secret. We went down to a city in Ohio, and remained three weeks, during
                     which he was kind, even loving, the same gentle Harry—and I was only too happy
                     to live in his smiles. I gave readings, sold my book, and made a great deal of
                     money, always, of course, handing it over to my husband.</p>
                  <p>We lived very happily until July, 1859, when he informed me he wished me to
                     make a trip to Michigan and Illinois to sell my book. I consented to do so,
                     leaving all my business, money, plates of my book, and all, in his hands.</p>
                  <p>On the 4th of July I started from Cincinnati, came to Indianapolis, and from
                     there through to Terra Haute, Indiana.</p>
                  <p>Now for my experiences in Illinois and Michigan. It was evening when I first
                     made my appearance in Paris, Ill. By the way, I had taken a young lady with me
                     from the capital, and was trying to teach her to sell "Liberty or Death." When
                     the iron horse stopped, we were met by a "sucker" with "Do you want a buss?" I
                     asked him who there was to buss me. He made me understand that it was an
                     omnibus; if I wanted a place to stay all night, I could get in and come down to
                     the tavern, as they would keep me as cheap as anybody would. I handed him my
                     basket, told Mary to take a seat in the omnibus, and I would see to my trunks.
                     In a few moments we were all seated, and away we went for the "tavern," as the
                     boy called it. At the door we were met by an old man, with—</p>
                  <p>"Do you want a room? How long do you want to stay? Have you got a trunk? If you
                        <emph>hain't,</emph> we take the money in advance, before we give you your
                     supper."</p>
                  <p>I told him I had trunks and plenty of money, handing him a bill, for I<pb
                        n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7162-00000011"/> was tired and wanted my room. The old
                     man gave us the best room, and some corn bread and pork for supper, with a
                     promise that we should have a nice breakfast.</p>
                  <p>I staid in that village a day and a half. From there I went to Charleston,
                     sending Mary in advance to have bills posted, as I intended to give a reading.
                     I was greeted in that place in pretty much the same way. Indeed, it is almost
                     impossible for a lady to travel in Illinois alone; unless she has the nerve of
                     a man it is useless to try.</p>
                  <p>We sold some fifty dollars' worth of tickets for my reading. We were told by
                     some of the citizens that it would be impossible to read, as so many had tried
                     and could not succeed; but as I am one that never gives up, I told them I would
                     attend to that part myself. So I did. On the appointed evening the Court-house
                     was crowded—filled to overflowing. I ascended the stage and commenced reading.
                     About fifty little boys were seated on the front seat. I read until I came to
                     the first pause; they commenced ringing bells, blowing horns, shouting,
                     screaming, and singing. I sat down; when all was quiet I read on; they
                     applauded me in the same style. I sat down the second time; the noise ceased. I
                     arose and appealed to them and their parents, but in vain—the worse it grew.
                     What could I do? At last I broke through the crowd, which let me out, then
                     rushed after me, with the words ringing in my ears, "Give us back our money;"
                     but that I did not intend to do. On I went to the hotel, with about fifty at my
                     side and in advance of me. When I arrived at the hotel, it was to find my door
                     locked, and my poor Mary in hysterics. I wanted to know of the landlord what it
                     all meant. I was informed that he could keep no person in his house who was the
                     cause of so much excitement. I then told him that I thought he should have got
                     used to it by this time, as it was a common occurrence in that heathenish
                     place. I commanded him to give up the key; he said he was afraid of a mob. I I
                     told him then to let them come, I was ready for any that might make their
                     appearance. I went up to my room, told Mary to sleep a few hours, and I would
                     keep watch and sleep the after part of the night. I seated myself by a window,
                     after barring the door well with an iron bar. Nothing was heard; all was as
                     still as death until about two o'clock, when I heard footsteps approaching the
                     door. I listened, but said nothing. A suppressed whisper was heard under the
                     window. A low shed roof was under the window, which they could easily reach
                     after gaining the roof with a ladder. I waited until they began to force it
                     open; then I stepped forward, and, in as firm a voice as I could, I commanded
                     them to leave or they would be sorry for it; but the worse it got. I shook
                     sleepy Mary until I succeeded in arousing her, and then I let the mob have the
                     benefit of a six-shooter I had prepared for the occasion. The way they made
                     their escape was not slow. I retired and slept soundly, feeling confident that
                     I had frightened them, and taught them a lesson they would not forget soon.</p>
                  <p>The next morning, the first one I saw was the proprietor's son. I soon bade all
                     good morning, and took the first train of cars, thinking, as I went, if all
                     Illinois was like the two places I had visited, I should have to turn back.</p>
                  <p>I travelled as far as Peoria without stopping. There I found the people more
                     civilized. I stopped with a southern family, where I felt myself at home, had a
                     good room, plenty to eat and drink, and good company. We went riding, fishing,
                     and hunting on the beautiful prairie. I went from there to Springfield, the
                     capital. What a delightful road to travel. You can see five miles on the
                     straight road. It is one of the nicest that I have ever travelled; flowers on
                     either side of richest hue.</p>
                  <p>All this time I had heard but once from Harry, and that was in answer to a
                     dispatch I sent to him.</p>
                  <p>Nothing more of importance transpired until I arrived in Chicago. I received
                     some twenty letters from my husband, that had been forwarded to me from the
                     different towns where they had arrived after I left. These letters were full of
                     love, endearing words, and assurances that he would never forget me, and that
                     it would not be long before we would meet again. I thought he loved me, and
                     think so yet. I will think so—I must; I cannot think so badly of one that I
                     have loved so much. God knows I was as true to him as I was to my own soul.</p>
                  <p>I spent a pleasant time in Chicago, sold a great many books, going out on the
                     lake with parties from the city. I wore Harry's miniature in a pin.</p>
                  <p>When I left Chicago, I went to a small town in Michigan, where I met a
                     gentleman, whose first exclamation was:</p>
                  <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7162-00000012"/>
                  <p>"Why do you wear that miniature? Is he a friend, or what? He is a married
                     man."</p>
                  <p>I told him that it was my husband's. Said he:</p>
                  <p>"Hattia, I know him well; he has a wife in the city of New York."</p>
                  <p>I could not believe it, but wrote to him, telling him of what I had heard. He
                     did not answer me. He had all my money, as I sent it to him every week.</p>
                  <p>When I arrived in Jackson, Michigan, I met another gentleman who told me the
                     same. I then thought of going to New York on purpose to ascertain the truth, as
                     I had the street, number, and all. I wrote to him, and informed him of my
                     intention, when the answer to me was, "Give Mrs. —— my love when you see her,
                     Hattia." When that letter reached me, I thought it all a joke, and treated it
                     as such; but my hopes were all blasted in a week's time.</p>
                  <p>I was out of books and money. I wrote to him every day, but no answer came, I
                     wrote to the publishers; they treated me the same. In answer to about twenty
                     letters, I received one from my publisher; that he would send me books at $10
                     per hundred, when they only cost me $4; that I must pay that in order to pay
                     Mr. —— the $90, that I owed him. And one came from Harry at the same time,
                     telling me that I was not his wife, and that I owed him money; I must pay him,
                     or I should not have my plates or books, and that he would complain to the ——
                     if I gave him any more trouble.</p>
                  <p>What could I do? I knew I was married—I had a marriage certificate. But I must
                     go down and see him; there was something wrong. I went to the superintendent of
                     the road; he is a kind, good man, and a gentleman. He gave me a pass as far as
                     he could; I then pawned my trunk for the balance. It was Saturday morning when
                     I arrived in Indianapolis. But, by the way, I had almost forgotten to say that
                     I had taken two hundred books at the above price, and gave orders to the
                     express agent to keep the money until I ordered him what to do. This was some
                     two weeks before I returned to Indianapolis.</p>
                  <p>At noon, Saturday, I made my way to the publisher, when I informed him that I
                     must have my books and plates, if nothing more; that they had leagued
                     themselves together to cheat me out of my money. As they had in their
                     possession about $9,000 of my money, and all I was worth, I beseeched him to
                     give me part—to give me an order for the $20 in Detroit, as I had borrowed it
                     from a gentleman who needed it very much. He refused to do so. I went to him
                     once more. He gave me an order, but after he had collected the money himself,
                     he said that he would take the responsibility of printing me a thousand books
                     at $4 per hundred.</p>
                  <p>I started with three hundred copies from Indianapolis, in disgust, with my
                     heart almost broken, as I could hear nothing from Harry. They would tell me
                     nothing. I stopped at a small town in Indiana. I made inquiry, but did not tell
                     them who I was. I was informed by a servant that a gentleman had left, the day
                     before, with his wife and little son, about three years old. Oh, God! no pen
                     could paint my feelings. But I kept firm. It was whispered in the house, and
                     remarks were going the rounds at the dinner table that I was rather better
                     looking than Mrs. ——. Harry, knowing well that I would do as I said, had sent
                     for her when I made known to him my intention of visiting her in New York. That
                     week he sailed with my money for California, leaving his wife and myself to
                     share the same fate patiently, if we liked. He did not love her, and would not
                     live with her. He could not, for officers were already on his track.</p>
                  <p>When I returned to Detroit, there were five hundred books, which should have
                     been $20 instead of $50—$10 per hundred. I sent the books back to him, and have
                     not heard from him since. I thought I would starve in peace, if starve I must,
                     and not trouble myself about books at that price. As I have heard nothing of
                     those publishers since, I wish them all the good luck in this world, and as
                     much happiness in the next as they can enjoy.</p>
                  <p>I cannot yet believe what I already know about Harry—or Mr. ——, as I must call
                     him now. It appears a dream; but oh, it is a reality. But I feel that I am a
                     wiser woman, and I trust a better one. My confidence in man is lost.</p>

                  <head type="sub">MY VISIT TO PHILADELPHIA—SELLING ALMANACS.</head>
                  <p>FROM Detroit I had money to bring me to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. When I
                     arrived in that city I had four cents left. I had no baggage. I walked to a
                     hotel, where I had stopped before, thinking if I could get books to sell I
                     would soon have money, for I have a great deal of faith in my book-selling.
                     Friday morning, after I arrived, I went to a firm and told them my
                     circumstances. Mr. M. proposed to me that I should start out with a new
                     almanac. Reader, you perhaps can imagine my feelings going through markets,
                     streets, hotels, and every other place, with a five cent almanac. I sold them
                     until Saturday evening, making enough to pay for three hundred Monday morning.
                     My bill was sent up to me. I, of course, could not pay it, as I had but
                     twenty-five cents. I told them I would pay my bill as soon as possible, taking
                     my leave of them. I stopped every day at the small towns, selling my books, and
                     in a week I was in Philadelphia. Thinking I could get into some good situation
                     as saleswoman, I walked two days through the city, but could get nothing to do.
                     Plenty of work, but I had no letters to recommend me. I was almost insane. Mr.
                     A——, publisher, let me have books; but in a city like Philadelphia what can you
                     do with books, unless you are the author yourself, and then it would be
                     difficult to sell them, for there is more literature than anything else in the
                     Quaker City.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>Tuesday Evening.—I can get nothing to do. I am at a colored
                     family's—could get no boarding-house without baggage, and I thought I should
                     have to stay in the street—I went to a colored barber and told him I must stay
                     all night; they succeeded in getting me a boarding-house until next morning,
                     when I shall start out once more to try and obtain work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>Monday Morning, Nov. 28, 1859.—This morning I went to the
                     intelligence office, as the last resort; but it is noon, and I have returned
                     with a heavy heart to my not very attractive boarding-house, with a promise
                     that I should have a situation this afternoon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>Afternoon.—I am again seated in the office—but it is not the
                     place I had always thought it was—not the low and vulgar haunt—but genteel
                     people, both male and female, visit it for the purpose of obtaining work. A
                     nice, genteel young girl attends the poor women and girls that are driven by
                     adversity to seek a home somewhere, and that is the only place where they can
                     find one, it appears, in a city like Philadelphia—a city of love and
                     charity—they must have a letter to recommend them; if not, they must starve or
                     go to a place like this, and perhaps they will stand a chance of getting
                     one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>Evening.—At last I have obtained a situation in a minister's
                     house. Of course they will treat me well; they are too good and holy to do
                     anything but right. We have travelled seven miles in a carriage, and I am
                     seated in the kitchen with my bonnet on, as I was not allowed to warm myself by
                     the stove in the dining-room where the rest were, but I was ushered in by the
                     lady herself, and have had an introduction to the kitchen. Well, we must take
                     things as they are—I will make myself at home.</p>
                  <p>8 <hi rend="i"/>o'clock.—I was informed an hour ago that I could spread the
                     kitchen table and bring my supper out, as they were all done; but as I didn't
                     wish supper, I was coldly informed that I could wash the silver in the
                     dining-room and bring the rest of the dishes into <emph>my</emph> parlor, the
                     kitchen. I did so.</p>
                  <p>I brought up coal, made things all ready for breakfast, and felt more at home,
                     under the circumstances, perhaps, than any one else could; but I am one that
                     always hopes for better days; those who have never had such an experience
                     little know the heart trial of such a thing. Ah! we may often say, "let me go
                     to strangers;" yes, that will do when we have money to spend, but to-night I
                     can say with the poet— <q>
                        <l>"The dearest spot to me on earth is home, sweet home."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7162-00000014"/>
                  <p>I look back on my life; I can say that it has been made up of lights and
                     shadows—sunshine and sorrow. I have retired to my room; it is a little lone
                     room in the attic. A bed, one chair, and a table—that completes the furniture.
                     Although a bitter cold night, I have no fire. A small oil lamp burning on the
                     table adds to the loneliness of the room. I have searched the place and tried
                     the windows, to make sure no person can enter. I shall retire in a few minutes.
                     Wonder what to-morrow will bring forth. I hope I shall have pleasant dreams—so
                     good night. I won't feel bad—back, tears! I'll be a woman.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>Tuesday Evening, 7 o'clock.—To-day I have done more than I ever
                     did at once in my life. I can hardly get up out of my chair; a rheumatic pain
                     has gone all through my body. God only knows what will become of me. This
                     morning I took my breakfast in the kitchen, and was employed in washing until
                     noon; then I was told that I could rest myself and wash the dinner dishes. At
                     5, I think I had washed everything in the house. The grand lady came out and
                     told me that it was supper-time. I informed her that if she wished to be a lady
                     herself, she must keep servants—that I intended to leave. So it is 7, and I am
                     waiting for morning, as I think if I must live this way I prefer death. Hark!
                     they are singing a hymn, "Am I a Soldier of the Cross?"—now they kneel at
                     prayer. Well, they have need of it, let them pray; I bid them good night; they
                     can eat their supper and wash the dishes, but I shall retire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>Wednesday Morning.—I bade them all good bye and set out for the
                     city, where I arrived in good time. Mr. F—— offers me books on commission. I
                     shall leave for some little town this afternoon.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi rend="i"/>o'clock, P.M.—I am seated in the cabin of a beautiful little
                     steamer on the Delaware river; the scenery is delightful, and the day is the
                     finest of the season; the sun is shining in all its glory, the boat is floating
                     upon the water like the summer breeze, and a pleasant party aboard</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>Evening—Burlington, New Jersey—Hotel.—I am seated in my room,
                     more comfortable than I have been for a week. I appreciate comfort more than I
                     have ever done, for I have never felt the <unclear>need</unclear> of money so
                     much until I went to Philadelphia. God help me! may I never feel so again; and
                     if I should be so fortunate as to have plenty once more, may I never forget the
                     poor. I spent the last cent I had to come to this place; but I have energy, and
                     if I keep my health I can soon have money. I will compose my mind and try to
                     sleep.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>Thursday Evening.—To-day I have sold five dollars' worth of
                     books, of which $2 50 is mine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>Friday Morning.—To-day Captain Brown will be executed.</p>
                  <p>11 <hi rend="i"/>o'clock.—A dispatch received; he is dead; his wife awaits his
                     body. How I sympathize with the poor woman.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>Evening.—I have sold twelve dollars' worth of books to-day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>Saturday Morning.—All seated in the cabin of the Edwin Forrest
                     this bitter cold day—for what a change: yesterday warm and balmy, to-day we
                     must hover close to the stove to keep warm. There are about three hundred
                     passengers for Trenton, within a mile of the city. We are on a sand-bar, but in
                     an hour the captain says we can land and take the cars. Well, at last we are in
                     Trenton. It is evening, and I am seated alone in my room. Have sold books
                     enough to make me comfortable in money matters. On the cars I met a gentleman
                     who took charge of my baggage and kindly conducted me to a hotel, where I am
                     cared for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>Sunday.—Very lonely to-day—all alone in my room.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>Evening.—I begin to feel myself; once more I am in good
                     spirits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>Monday Evening.—Sold a hundred books.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi rend="i"/>Evening.—Am seated in the cars on my way to New York city.

                                 I was married four years ago to a woman I can never love. If you
                                 can forgive me, come to me. I had to leave, as you already know;
                                 she followed me. What could I do? I had no money of my own, and was
                                 compelled to use yours. Can you forgive me? You are the only woman
                                 I ever loved, or ever can. For God's sake come. I will send you
                                 money if you will consent to come. Yours ever,</p>

                  <head>MEETING AN ENEMY.</head>
                  <p>While promenading one of the fashionable streets in New York one pleasant
                     afternoon, my eyes rested on the plate on the door of one of the finest houses
                     in the city. It made me start, a cold perspiration stood in great drops on my
                     forehead. Without thinking what I was about, I rang the bell, and asked for Mr.
                     H. Moore, as that was the name—it might be the man who killed my first husband.
                     I took a seat in the richly-furnished parlor, and awaited his coming; I did not
                     send my card, and he was not thinking of the one he had to meet. When he
                     entered he started back, gasped for breath, and would have fallen; but I was at
                     his side in an instant. He was like a child. I led him to a sofa and seated
                     myself by him. He was almost gone with a consumption. He said he had not long
                     to live; that he was glad to see me—would I accept his house for my home? He
                     had repented of all he had done—was sorry. He was going, fast dying; he had
                     made his peace with God. He told me to listen to him. Said he, "This house is
                     rightly yours; I robbed you of all you had at your husband's death. I had no
                     mortgage on your property, but forged it. On my knees I beg you to forgive me
                     before I die. I leave a will which makes you the right and only owner of all I
                     possess. Here is a purse for your present use." I left him and returned to my
                     hotel. The next morning I was summoned to his side: he was dying. I wiped the
                     cold sweat from his face and closed his eyes. All who met me there thought I
                     was an old friend. The property is all in my possession. I have money at my
                     command. Shall I ever forget the poor? No, no. I won't go to Europe. Neither
                     will I indulge again with summer friends who run and leave you when money is
                     gone. God help me to do right. I intend to travel with my new work which, I am
                     writing, and let the world read a Hoosier girl's life. I intend to help the
                     poor, and do the best in my power to promote the happiness of others.</p>

                  <p>IT was my intention to hunt up the wife of Harry and try to make her happy. I
                     therefore went to work putting advertisements in the different papers stating
                     that if Mrs. Allen would call at such a number she would hear something to her
                     advantage. A week passed and she did not call. I had almost given up ever
                     finding her, when one morning I was summoned to the parlor.</p>
                  <p>A lady advanced to the centre of the room, and introduced herself as Mrs.
                     Allen. She was a woman of about twenty-eight years; she was pale, her eyes were
                     sunken, she had once been beautiful, she had a well-chiselled mouth, her form
                     was exquisite, but she wore such a sad and sorrowful expression that you were
                     at once drawn toward her. She stood gazing at me for a minute, and then rushed
                     into my arms exclaiming "Hattia!" at the same time I called her by name, Maud.
                     Ah, we had met before on the Ohio, seven years ago, ere care had left its marks
                     upon her brow. Does the reader recognize Maud of Wheeling, Va., when she was
                     lifted from the water at Cincinnati?</p>
                  <p>I explained all to her; told her that we had been both married to one man. We
                     vowed to be to each other all that sisters could be; we intend travelling
                     together, As long as I have money it is hers. I already love her, she is so
                     good, noble, and everything in her to love—self-sacrificing and
                     sympathizing.</p>
                  <p>It is Christmas eve. We are seated in our private parlor at the hotel. I have
                     just received another letter from California, it is dated five days later than
                     the one I received, but had been detained. It reads thus:</p>

                        At his request I write to you. He was taken sick three<pb n="36-37"

                        lips. It was the last word he spoke—'Hattia, Hattia! oh, forgive me: for

                  <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
                  <p>TOWARDS the end of April, in the year 1833, a fine looking young man, with a
                     gun on his shoulder, traversed one of those vast pine forests, which,
                     commencing at the foot of the Vosges, seem to crown the highest peaks of the
                     mountains with a diadem of verdure. Our pedestrian—the brilliancy of whose well
                     varnished boots clearly proved the shortness of his journey—soon reached the
                     outskirts of the wood, and directed his steps towards a little cottage,
                     situated at the bottom of the valley.</p>
                  <p>This was the residence of Captain Morizot a veteran of the Empire, wreck of our
                     victorious legions, living ruin of an epoch, whose heroes are already gigantic,
                     though not yet viewed through the microscope of ages. M. Morizot had lived
                     fifty years, yet his hair was but slightly tinged with gray. His face, somewhat
                     wrinkled around the temples, never wore a smile. He possessed one of those iron
                     constitutions, which resist alike fatigue and adversity; for, our readers must
                     know, the captain had been exposed to terrible affliction. A woman, whom he
                     loved with all the powers of his soul, had shamefully betrayed him. The
                     soldier, on his return from the camp, hoped to find this woman, as he had
                     formerly known her, affectionate and pure. He desired to make her his wife;
                     but, like many others, when absent he was basely sacrificed. Nineteen years
                     after this infidelity, which had broken his heart, the captain suffered as
                     acutely as on the first day, and often would it agitate his mind, impelling him
                     to repulse the caresses of his daughter, a sweet and amiable child, who would
                     run to console him, when she saw his brow darken with a frown, and the heavy
                     tears course down his cheeks.</p>
                  <p>"Leave me, Louise, leave me!" he would say with a harsh impetuous voice: "You
                     resemble her, and your presence recalls to me odious remembrances!"</p>
                  <p>But soon repenting these words, which gave vent to inconsolable<pb n="38-39"
                        xml:id="VAC7162-00000018"/> grief, the old soldier would approach Louise,
                     who had tremblingly drawn back, and tenderly embrace her. The young girl would
                     then endeavor to discover the cause of these sudden outbreaks.</p>
                  <p>"No, no," M. Morizot would say to her, "do not question me. You are my
                     daughter; oh! yes, you are my daughter, and I love you!"</p>
                  <p>Apart from these occasional unpleasant scenes, the manner of life at the
                     cottage was quiet, and full of charms. The captain received a pension of five
                     hundred francs, which was more than enough for the humble wants of Louise and
                     himself. With very singular originality, M. Morizot had willed that his
                     daughter should be brought up like the simplest peasant. He desired himself to
                     give her the education of the heart; but for the education of the mind he
                     altogether neglected to provide. With the old soldier this conduct was the
                     result of a well-established system; and we are inclined to believe he would
                     have been but indifferently pleased to hear that another had undertaken to
                     repair this voluntary neglect.</p>
                  <p>This was the cause of an incident which occurred two months previous to the
                     commencement of our tale.</p>
                  <p>While the captain was absent from the cottage, Louise took care to remove an
                     old domestic, who assisted her in the labors of the household. Then she mounted
                     to her chamber, and waved a white handkerchief from her window in the air. The
                     young girl was sure that the signal would be perceived by M. Ernest Forestelle,
                     the nephew of the richest lumber merchant in the neighborhood.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly the blessed handkerchief no sooner appeared from her window, than
                     he, whom it summoned, hastened to leave the magnificent residence of his uncle,
                     situated at some distance on the declivity of the mountain, It was Ernest
                     Forestelle who traversed the pine forest which separated the chateau of the
                     merchant from the cottage of the captain.</p>
                  <p>The latter had gone to Raon l'Etape to receive a quarterly instalment of his
                     pension.</p>
                  <p>Joyous and smiling, Louise awaited Ernest at the threshold of the door. On his
                     approach she ran to salute him, and then they both walked to the side of a
                     little garden, enclosed by a live hedge, and cultivated by M. Morizot himself,
                     who had only two passions, that of the chase and that of gardening. Out of a
                     small piece of ground, lying near his dwelling, the captain had made a sort of
                     Eden in miniature. All the mountain plants, from the turpentine tree to the
                     fragrant grapevine, from the yellow heath to the flower of gold, from the
                     periwinkle to the <foreign xml:lang="ITA">corolles d'azur,</foreign> and the
                     entire family of myrtles and syringas were united there, intertwining their
                     flexible branches, and mingling their perfumes. Arbors formed of the wild vine,
                     were disposed in the four corners of this lovely parterre, and it was under one
                     of these that Louise conducted her young professor.</p>
                  <p>They sat down together before a table, made of two deal planks nailed solidly
                     upon four stakes driven in the ground. Upon this table were some printed books,
                     and a manuscript copy book, which the young girl placed triumphantly under the
                     eyes of Ernest.</p>
                  <p>"See," said she, "how industrious I have been this morning."</p>
                  <p>"Really," replied the young man, "you will soon be more skilful than your
                     teacher, Louise."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, not so, M. Ernest. Think how many things I must yet learn. I can read with
                     facility, I write a little—but history! but geography! I am ashamed of being so
                     ignorant, and when I think that you have had the goodness to instruct me,
                        <emph>me,</emph> a poor girl—I can never express all my gratitude."</p>
                  <p>"S peak not of that, Louise. Tell me, does your father yet suspect any
                     thing?"</p>
                  <p>"No, but I shall soon betray myself—it is inevitable. As I have always told
                     you, M. Ernest, I am ashamed of my ignorance: you are so learned. But with my
                     father, it is a different thing. I am proud of the little I know, and every
                     moment I am dying with desire——Stop, yesterday again, M. Joseph Cornu, you
                     know, the secretary of the justice of the peace at Raon, read to the captain
                     the <title>Annals of Glory;</title> well, I was on the point of taking the book
                     and reading it in my turn."</p>
                  <p>"What imprudence! Oh, never do such a thing again, Louise, I conjure you!"</p>
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Mon Dieu,</foreign> monsieur Ernest, will you then
                     forbid me to inform my father how good you are, how obliging you are to
                     me?"</p>
                  <p>"No, Louise," answered the young man, with embarrassment; "but I desire you to
                     wait until my task shall have been accomplished, and you have become learned,
                     very learned."</p>
                  <p>"And that will require a long time yet?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no! for you have admirable talents, and I am certain that before a
                     month——"</p>
                  <p>"True!" she exclaimed, gaily clapping her hands; "then I can study with energy.
                     Let us not lose a minute."</p>
                  <p>"The surprise which you reserve for the captain will be far greater, when you
                     can relate to him the history of his emperor," pursued Ernest, while mending
                     Louise's pen.</p>
                  <p>"You are right," said the young girl. "My father already esteems you very
                     highly, monsieur Ernest; but he will esteem you far more, when I tell him how
                     greatly I am indebted to you."</p>
                  <p>"It might be quite the contrary, Louise; perhaps M. Morizot will censure
                     me."</p>
                  <p>"For what reason?" exclaimed she, with charming simplicity.</p>
                  <p>"The captain is, at times, so eccentric! For example, he has never been
                     willing, notwithstanding the repeated invitations of Madame Forestelle, to
                     bring you to the parties at the chateau."</p>
                  <p>"Madame Forestelle is very good, and very kind," replied the young girl; "but
                     what would a poor peasant girl look like among such a crowd of elegant ladies?
                     Great goodness! I tremble to think of it.<pb n="40-41"
                        xml:id="VAC7162-00000019"/> Look you, monsieur Ernest, every one should keep
                     to their place, as my father says. I am useful to look after the affairs of my
                     little household, and prepare you a supper, when you return together from the
                     chase, harassed with fatigue. There I must stop—I am capable of nothing more.
                     But you do not finish mending that pen, monsieur Ernest: shall I not write then
                     to-day?"</p>
                  <p>"Pardon me, Louise. Confess why the captain so wrongly suffers you to wear the
                     dress of a peasantess. Under a city costume you would be charming."</p>
                  <p>"Do you think so, M. Ernest?"</p>
                  <p>"Indeed I do, Louise. Ah! why has M. Morizot been unwilling to let you come to
                     the ball at the chateau this evening? I am confident that in the simplest
                     attire, you would eclipse Madamoiselle Victorine de Fontanges."</p>
                  <p>"What nonsense!" said the young girl.</p>
                  <p>"And then, your presence would sustain me, would give me courage—for I am very
                     unhappy, Louise."</p>
                  <p>"Sainte-vierge! you weep, M. Ernest," she cried, rising much agitated, and
                     approaching the young man. "Surely I have not given you cause for grief, have
                     I? That would be very much against my will, I swear, for I love you. It
                     sometimes seems to me that you are my brother."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes, Louise, you are kind, affectionate; you have all the virtues of an
                     angel."</p>
                  <p>Then he murmured, as if speaking to himself:</p>
                  <p>"And Frederick advised me to seduce her! No, never! I should be a
                     scoundrel."</p>
                  <p>"Listen!" said the young girl, suddenly; "it seems to me——what, already
                     returned?"</p>
                  <p>"It is the captain's voice," said Ernest, jumping up hastily: "I do not wish to
                     encounter him. Good by, Louise, good by!"</p>
                  <p>And the young man snatching up his gun, which lay in a corner of the arbor,
                     hastened away, after kissing the hand of his pupil, and lightly leaping over
                     the hedge that surrounded the garden, he soon disappeared behind the trees of
                     the valley; while Louise, (concealing her books and papers under a tuft of
                     honeysuckle,) soliloquized thus:</p>
                  <p>"And so, poor monsieur Ernest is unhappy! if he had only told me what grieved
                     him, I could perhaps, have consoled him."</p>
                  <p>"Louise, Louise!" cried the loud voice of her father.</p>
                  <p>"Here I am," she replied, running towards him with the swiftness of a
                     bird."</p>
                  <p>"You did not expect me so soon, did you, my child? Fancy who I met when half
                     way to Raon, guess who?—the paymaster himself, who was taking the air in his
                     carriage, whilst I was going to his office to obtain my quarterly instalment.
                     Truly, these gentlemen are free from care! After all, I shall be at liberty to
                     return to-morrow. But I have had another encounter to-day," added the captain,
                     pointing towards a stout youth, who had planted himself like a corner stone on
                     the steps of the cottage door. "The conscription was drawn to-day, and the
                     number <emph>one hundred and twenty</emph> has fallen on this coward of a
                     Joseph Cornu."</p>
                  <p>'As you say, captain, as you say," joined in the secretary of the justice of
                     the peace, advancing to salute Louise, his hat adorned with ribands of the
                     national colors; "and I have the pleasure, <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >palsambleu!</foreign> Don't be alarmed, mademoiselle, <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">palsambleu</foreign> is a very pretty word which I have
                     discovered in a modern novel."</p>
                  <p>"What! monsieur Joseph Cornu, do you read novels?" demanded Louise.</p>
                  <p>"Do I read novels, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">vertubleu! Vertubleu,</foreign>
                     mademoiselle, is yet another word, perfectly distinct. Do I read novels? I make
                     nourishment of them. I devour them; that is the most convenient expression I
                     can make use of."</p>
                  <p>"Novels," said the young girl with <foreign xml:lang="FRA">naivete,</foreign>
                     "must be a very amusing sort of reading."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">par la corbleu!</foreign> I affirm it to you.
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Par la corbleu!</foreign> mademoiselle, was the
                     favorite oath of his majesty, Louis XV., and I am enchanted to be able at this
                     moment to speak to you the language of that great king. Novels, look you,
                     novels——"</p>
                  <p>"Who speaks there, of novels?" cried M. Morizot, who during the dialogue above
                     reported, had been to put away his hat and cane in the next room.</p>
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Eh! ventrebleu!</foreign> it is me, captain!—<foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">Ventrebleu,</foreign> you must know, is another oath, which
                     the nobles of the age of Louis XV.——"</p>
                  <p>"And wherefore do you speak of novels, before my daughter!" thundered M.
                     Morizot, precipitating himself upon the unlucky conscript.</p>
                  <p>"Wherefore? <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Dame,</foreign> captain,—Oh! if you want to
                     strangle me, say so."</p>
                  <p>"My father," shrieked Louise, "what are you doing to the poor youth?"</p>
                  <p>"Indeed, I am wrong," said M. Morizot, releasing Joseph Cornu, whom he had
                     seized by the throat. "There, confess yourself an idiot."</p>
                  <p>"I will confess any thing you please, captain, provided——<foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">Palsambleu!</foreign> what wrists you have, for your
                     age!"</p>
                  <p>"Novels," said the old soldier, soliloquizing—"it was novels that ruined
                        <emph>her!</emph> But, once more, I have done wrong to alarm you," he
                     continued, addressing Louise; "for thank God, my child, you cannot read, and
                     that is a thing which I rejoice over every day. But, how pale and trembling you
                     look! I am to blame for frightening you in this manner—I am a brute. I confess
                     it. Now I think of it, Joseph, have you a mind to sup with us?"</p>
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Par la corbleu,</foreign> captain, I accept."</p>
                  <p>"What does the dog mean with his vertubleus, and his corbleus? I don't
                     understand such gibberish."</p>
                  <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7162-00000020"/>
                  <p>"But, captain, it is a very innocent mode of swearing; as good way as any."</p>
                  <p>"And why do you swear at all, I ask? Is it because you hear in swear; I, who am
                     an old soldier? You can but express yourself a you do, when you possess equal
                     pretensions."</p>
                  <p>"Excuse me, captain."</p>
                  <p>"Never mind, it is decided that you are to sup with us, and
                        <unclear>to</unclear> honor your number, we will uncork a bottle of Rhenish
                     wine. Quick Louise," added M. Morizot, "hasten to assist old Madeleine, and get
                        <unclear>up</unclear> an early supper. You know I am invited to the chateau
                     this evening."</p>
                  <p>"Eh!" cried Joseph, "I ought to go there too. The justice of the peace having
                     received a letter of invitation, M. Forestelle could no dispense with sending
                     me one."</p>
                  <p>"He was perfectly right. And doubtless you will go to
                        <unclear>present</unclear> yourself with that cockade in your hat?"</p>
                  <p>"No, captain, Mlle. Louise will have the goodness to unstitch these
                     ribands—Will you not, Mlle. Louise? Oh, she is gone! Then so much the better,
                     for I have something to say to you concerning her."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! Ah!"</p>
                  <p>"Going along, I have had my mouth open twenty times to communicate my thoughts
                     to you, but had not the courage. At the end of the relation, you cannot eat me.
                     So I risk myself."</p>
                  <p>"Speak out," said M. Morizot, seating himself upon a stone bench placed against
                     the front wall of the cottage. "Come and sit yourself down there, near me. So
                     you do not desire to experience any more of my sudden fits of madness."</p>
                  <p>"Whenever you have fits of that nature, do not restrain yourself captain.—Go
                     on! go on!"</p>
                  <p>"Brave youth!" said M. Morizot, pressing the hand of the young man with
                     emotion, "as you have witnessed, when I hear those infamous books spoken of, a
                     fit of frenzy overpowers me. Novels have <unclear>cost</unclear> me all the
                     happiness of my life."</p>
                  <p>"Well, captain, I will not read them again, I swear."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! I fear not for you. If you learn folly from that kind of works you will
                     lose it in the field; and the poison will have no lasting influence on your
                     frank and honorable nature. Come, what have you to communicate to me, of such
                     importance?"</p>
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Dame,</foreign> captain," replied Joseph, turning his
                     hat around between his knees, "I know not how to begin. You know that I receive
                     six hundred francs per annum, from the justice of the peace of Raon it is a
                     handsome salary, captain! It is true that boarding, washing and lodging, is not
                     included: but it is sufficient. I save out of it twenty francs per month, after
                     paying all expenses—and at my grand aunt's decease, (which I do not desire, but
                     the contrary!) I shall inherit a considerable sum, and be able to purchase the
                     registry You understand, captain?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, but proceed."</p>
                  <p>Ah! <foreign xml:lang="FRA">diable!</foreign> I have not began the most
                     difficult part of what I have to say!"</p>
                  <p>M. Morizot laughed in his sleeve. He saw clearly what the poor youth wanted to
                     come at, and was exceedingly amused at the perplexity depicted on his
                     countenance. The Secretary of the justice of the peace continued to twirl round
                     his felt hat, and the captain hoped that he would finish by transforming it
                     into a fashionable <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chapeau.</foreign> As they proposed
                     attending the ball of the lumber merchant together, M. Morizot did not think
                     proper to oppose such a metamorphosis.</p>
                  <p>"Well, have you lost the thread of you discourse?"</p>
                  <p>"No, captain, but I am so much afraid of a refusal. Bah! I am a fool!"</p>
                  <p>"So you say yourself."</p>
                  <p>"It is now two years since I made your acquaintance. Yes, captain, for two
                     years, I have visited you nearly every evening. It is rather more than a half
                     hour's walk from Raon l'Etape, to this place,—yet, in summer when it does not
                     storm, in winter when it freezes, I hurry off immediately the office is closed:
                     I come to read to you, the <title>Annals of Glory</title>—a very interesting
                     work, which I know by heart!"</p>
                  <p>"After?"</p>
                  <p>"Dame! captain, I have not made bad use of my boots; and I must tell you, this
                     was not done solely on your account."</p>
                  <p>"Well! that is very polite."</p>
                  <p>"I am on a subject which may vex you. No matter: I will utter the important
                     word—I will lay open my heart: <emph>I love mademoiselle Louise!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Ah! indeed?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, captain, and if my boldness offends you, here is my head—I give you leave
                     to cut it off."</p>
                  <p>"Take care, my lad," said M. Morizot, laughing.</p>
                  <p>"You are not offended then, captain?" demanded Joseph Cornu, with a joyful
                     air.</p>
                  <p>"You see that plainly enough, it appears to me. Listen—you come to me to ask
                     the hand of my daughter in marriage——"</p>
                  <p>"And you grant it?" suggested the secretary.</p>
                  <p>"Peste! how you run on! The consent of Louise is at least necessary."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon Dieu!</foreign> look how I tremble now. Should
                     she refuse to be my wife——"</p>
                  <p>"And why should she refuse? are you not a brave, an upright young man, of well
                     established principle? You are a little simple, to be sure, but marriage will
                     improve you."</p>
                  <p>"I hope it will, captain."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! ah!" said M. Morizot, "she comes to announce that supper is on the
                     table."</p>
                  <p>Indeed, the young girl stood at the threshold of the door. At meal hours, she
                     was accustomed to add some little ornaments to her toilet, and<pb n="44-45"
                        xml:id="VAC7162-00000021"/> under the singular but graceful costume of the
                     mountaineers, Louise was ravishingly beautiful. A velvet cap, set coquettishly
                     on her pretty head, left her snow-white forehead bare, and allowed her hair to
                     fall in graceful fillets, black as ebony. She wore around her neck a small
                     golden cross, consecrated by contact with the relics of the Saint of the Rock.
                     Her bodice, also of velvet, displayed her well formed waist, and her short
                     skirt, made of the plain gray cloth of the mountains, was set off by a calico
                     apron of gay colors. Nothing could be so artless, sincere, and virginal as this
                     lovely young girl, adorned with all her modesty and innocence: so that she was
                     called in the neighborhood, the Rose of the Valley. Louise was a brunette; her
                     cheeks, soft as the down of the peach: her eyes, large and blue, veiled with
                     long black lashes, might have startled the paintings of Raphael and Correggio;
                     and two adorable dimples, one at each corner of her rosy mouth, rendered her
                     smile sweet as an angel's.</p>
                  <p>At this moment the face of Louise was illumined by the last rays of the setting
                     sun, which softly glanced through the mountain pines. The secretary, beholding
                     her so beautiful, trembled with love and pleasure.</p>
                  <p>"Come here, Louise," said M. Morizot: "you will never betray the confidence
                     Joseph reposes in me."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! no, captain, not at present!" murmured the young man, with an air of
                     anxious supplication. If I were refused, I should not have the least appetite,
                     I assure you. I would much rather that you introduced the subject at the
                     desert—between two glassed of your excellent Rhenish wine. If I meet with bad
                     luck, I shall then have more courage to bear it."</p>
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Diable!</foreign>" cried M. Morizot, "you are full of
                     precautions. Let us wait then till the desert."</p>
                  <p>He entered the house. The young girl and Joseph followed him.</p>
                  <p>The cottage consisted of but one story. The ground floor contained the room
                     into which we are about to introduce our readers, and another apartment which
                     served alternately for a kitchen and a lodging room for old Madeleine. The
                     garret was divided into two chambers, one for M. Morizot, and the other for
                     Louise. In the rear of the cottage stood several out buildings, covered with
                     thatch, used partly for cattle and partly for the clamorous inhabitants of the
                     poultry yard. All this breathed an air of pastoral simplicity, which made it
                     delightful to look upon. Here and there, fountains of limped water spouted
                     forth their foaming streams, washing the pavements of the court, and
                     maintaining the salubrity of the stables. The walls were densely shaded with
                     ivy, and when after a thunder storm, the sun illumined the drops of water
                     suspended on this verdure, the poor and humble residence of the captain
                     sparkled with emeralds and sapphires like the palace of the fairies.</p>
                  <p>But, return we into the first apartment of the cottage, where all our
                     personages were left preparing to take their evening repast.</p>
                  <p>This was the room in which they received strangers, yet it had not the
                     slightest appearance of luxury. The Vosges are on the frontiers of Germany, and
                     the character of the mountaineers conforms very nearly to that of the Germans
                     the same open and sincere hospitality, but also the same reserve, the same
                     defence against improper inquisitiveness into the family sanctuary. The room,
                     of which we speak, was large and spacious. At the end was an immense
                     fire-place, around which a circle of ten parsons could enjoy the pleasing
                     warmth on a winter night. To the right of this patriarchal hearth, stood a bed,
                     hung with curtains of green serge, reserved for strangers, when suddenly driven
                     to seek shelter from those overwhelming thunder-storms, of so frequent
                     occurrence among the Vosges, which turn the rivulets into torrents, and prevent
                     the traveller from returning to his domicil, unless at the peril of his life.
                     Time and again, had Ernest Forestelle and Joseph Cornu slept upon that
                     hospitable bed, and dreamed of the girl they loved—for the intelligent reader
                     has long ere this, discovered that the secretary of the justice of the peace
                     and the nephew of the merchant, are rivals, though unknown to themselves. The
                     other sides of the room were surrounded with shelves laden with pewter vessels,
                     the brightness of which did the housekeeper credit. On the same shelves, ranged
                     in file, were pans of milk, pots of butter, and wooden boxes containing new
                     cheese, of which the bathers at Plombiéres are so fond. These little fruits of
                     rural industry had the two-fold advantage of occupying the time of Louise, and
                     augmenting the revenues of M. Morizot; for every Saturday, old Madeleine
                     mounted an ass with the surplus of these domestic provisions, and went to sell
                     them in the market at Raon.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile the supper was finished. The captain lit his pipe, opening first that
                     famous bottle of Rhenish wine, which he had praised so highly. Joseph Cornu
                     turned his restless eyes alternately on the father and the daughter, and M.
                     Morizot, observing the embarrassment of the secretary, laughed quietly in his
                     sleeve, and filled the room with dense clouds of Alsatian tobacco smoke.</p>
                  <p>All at once, he exclaimed without any preamble.</p>
                  <p>"Tell me, Louise, would you like to be married, my child?"</p>
                  <p>The young girl regarded the captain with surprise.</p>
                  <p>"My father," said she, "if you consider it advisable—you know that your will
                     has always been mine."</p>
                  <p>"That is what she ought to say. My dear child, it will ever grieve I me to
                     force your inclination. What would you think of this kind of a husband?" he
                     pursued, tapping Joseph Cornu on the shoulder.</p>
                  <p>"It seems to me, my father——"</p>
                  <p>"Go on, speak fearlessly."</p>
                  <p>"That monsieur Joseph would make a good husband, and render his wife very
                     happy."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes, mademoiselle!" cried the secretary, rising from his chair, and
                     running to throw himself at the young girl's knees; "my life shall be entirely
                     devoted to your happiness. Oh, my God! is not this a dream! She consents to be
                     my wife! You love me then Louise?"</p>
                  <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7162-00000022"/>
                  <p>"One welcomes with joy, those whom one loves," she replied, smiling gently,
                     "and whenever you have come to see us——"</p>
                  <p>"I am loved, captain! I am loved! do you understand?" cried Joseph, dancing
                     round the room, and tossing his hat in the air. "And I am relieved from the
                     conscription! two blessings in one day! It's enough to make, me crazy with
                     joy!"</p>
                  <p>"I know yon well on that point, you coward," said M. Morizot, attempting a tear
                     of pity. "You have an awful dread of going to fight the Bedouins, and leaving
                     your skin among the deserts of Atlas."</p>
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Dame!</foreign> captain, I wish you were there."</p>
                  <p>"What do you mean by those words?"</p>
                  <p>"Pardon—I talk nonsense. A veteran soldier like you, asks for nothing but
                     wounds and promotion! Come now, acknowledge that it will be much more agreeable
                     for you to have us both, my little wife and me, to nurse you night and day. And
                     then, we will have children, captain. Sweet little cherubs who shall resemble
                     Louise"——</p>
                  <p>"What! can't you; hold your tongue?" said M. Morizot, rising in his turn, and
                     taking Joseph Cornu by the ear, which he pulled roughly. "Do me the favor to
                     put a little restraint on your conversation for a while. When shall the wedding
                     take place?"</p>
                  <p>"As soon as possible, captain."</p>
                  <p>"I did not speak to you—answer me, Louise."</p>
                  <p>"Whenever you think proper, my father."</p>
                  <p>"Go, you are a good girl," said M. Morizot, embracing her tenderly. "Brush my
                     coat, and unstitch the ribands from the hat of your intended, for we must
                     prepare to start."</p>
                  <p>"Shall you wear your cross, my father?"</p>
                  <p>"Certainly," said Joseph.</p>
                  <p>"Why do you interfere?"</p>
                  <p>"Listen, then. I am now one of the family—I have a voice in your
                     deliberations."</p>
                  <p>"It is evident, and I must obey," said M. Morizot, opening a little casket of
                     mother-of-pearl, which stood on the mantel-piece.</p>
                  <p>He drew forth a cross of the Legion of Honor, and said, showing it to Louise
                     and her future husband:</p>
                  <p>"Behold the only inheritance I shall be able to leave you, my children. My
                     pension is not large: we shall spend nearly the whole of it, and you know it
                     expires with me."</p>
                  <p>"Good!" exclaimed Joseph, again tossing to the ceiling his hat, which the young
                     girl had returned to him, after depriving it of all superfluous ornament; "I
                     forgot to tell you something, Upon my honor, joy makes me stupid. Know then,
                     good father, know then, mademoiselle Louise, that we are possibly going to be
                     wealthy, that we may yet roll in riches!"</p>
                  <p>"Are you mad?" demanded M. Morizot.</p>
                  <p>"No, indeed, I possess at this moment all my wonted intelligence. You know,
                     captain, that M. Forestelle has put his chateau in a lottery—his chateau, the
                     very same to which we are going this night."</p>
                  <p>"Well?"</p>
                  <p>"Now, then—I have three hundred francs in my little treasury, and I have bought
                     two tickets out of my savings for the last two years."</p>
                  <p>"Two-fold simpleton! Do you not see that this old miser of a M Forestelle, who,
                     I believe, intends retiring to Paris, for he has made a colossal fortune by
                     ruining, with his machinery, all the labors of our poor plank sawyers—do you
                     not see, I say, that despairing of ever finding a purchaser for his country
                     house, (his chateau, if you like it better,) he has put it in a lottery with
                     the sole design of obtaining a higher price?"</p>
                  <p>"I do not deny it, captain."</p>
                  <p>"There is a wickedness in these lotteries," continued M. Morizot; "for they
                     only serve to generate avarice in the breast of the poor man, and to dissipate
                     his utmost resources, by exciting in his mind the thirst of gain. The
                     government will, I hope, sooner or later put a stop to them. How many
                     unfortunate beings will repent of having cast away their savings in this abyss.
                     And you yourself idiot, you yourself——"</p>
                  <p>"Ah! it is different with me. I have some chance, and I attribute it to the
                     number <emph>one hundred and twenty,</emph> which I pulled at the first draw,
                     right under the nose of the mayor—in proof of which that respectable magistrate
                     said to me with an accent of paternal kindness, 'That dog of a Cornu! God
                     forgive me, he was born lucky.' Then, look you, captain, every one talks about
                     it. And, you must also be informed, I have taken the tickets in the name of
                     mademoiselle Louise. An angel of innocence like her must be sure to win
                     everywhere and continually."</p>
                  <p>"What!" said the young girl, "have you done such a silly thing as that?"</p>
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Mon Dieu,</foreign> yes, my dear Louise, and much
                     more. I have selected the numbers corresponding to your age and mine, eighteen
                     and twenty-one. So, if they do not win, it must be owing to malice."</p>
                  <p>"Hold your tongue," said M. Morizot, "or you will certainly conclude by putting
                     me in a passion."</p>
                  <p>"Bah!" cried Joseph, "after all, if the drawing should not be favorable to us,
                     that will only be three hundred francs lost; my little wife will still remain
                     to me, a real treasure. Is it not so, captain? <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Mon
                        Dieu,</foreign> the happiest people in this world are not the richest, and I
                     am very sure that M. Ernest Forestelle is less pleased to espouse mademoiselle
                     Victorine de Fontanges, than I am to marry Louise. This night's ball has the
                     air of a betrothal fete."</p>
                  <p>"What!" said the young girl, with a tremulous voice, "monsieur Ernest going to
                     marry?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, my child," replied M. Morizot, "and I fear very much that his
                     money-griping uncle has forced him to this marriage, because he saw in prospect
                     a dowry of four hundred thousand francs. I am very sorry for monsieur Ernest,
                     for he is a brave and worthy young man."</p>
                  <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7162-00000023"/>
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Certes</foreign>, yes, captain; and he has more worth
                     in his little finger than his friend Frederic d'Ormeuil, in his whole person.
                     You know that fop, who wants to make love to all the country girls around?
                     Should he ever cross my prospects—oh, <foreign xml:lang="ITA"
                        >Sacristi!</foreign>"</p>
                  <p>"Go along, braggadocio as you are," said the captain. "It is time we were
                     started, and on the road we will chat over our affairs. Good night, Louise;
                     good night, my child—but how dejected you seem."</p>
                  <p>In fact, the young girl was seated apart, and the tears streamed from her
                     eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Let us leave her, captain," whispered Joseph Cornu in the ear of M. Morizot;
                     "marriage always makes young girls delirious. You know that, I hope, at your
                     age. <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Au revoir,</foreign> Louise, my little wife."</p>
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Au revoir,</foreign> monsieur Joseph," replied Louise,
                     sadly.</p>
                  <p>"Humph!" grumbled M. Morizot, "this appears very strange to me. Go on. Louise,"
                     he said in a commanding voice, "I desire you to shut yourself up securely with
                     old Madeleine. I have my key. I will return at a seasonable hour."</p>
                  <p>The captain, accompanied by Joseph Cornu, sallied out of the cottage, and took
                     the road towards the chateau of M. Forestelle. Louise watched them slowly
                     disappear among the trees of the forest, then, raising her eyes to heaven, she
                     exclaimed in tones of grief:</p>
                  <p>"Poor monsieur Ernest! It was doubtless for this reason that he <unclear>so
                        often</unclear> told me he was unhappy."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <p>THE sun had long since disappeared behind the mountains, and the moon having
                     risen at the other extremity of the horizon, darted her tremulous rays through
                     the dark curtain of the pines, and illuminated the tops of verdant oaks and
                     flexible briches. One could hear, at a distance, the songs of nightingales, and
                     the murmuring of cascades, which, falling from a lofty source, rushed over the
                     surface of the rocks, and finally coursed along in little silvery streams upon
                     the flowery heath.</p>
                  <p>"I told you that we would converse of our affairs," said M. Morizot, who leaned
                     familiarly on the arm of Joseph Cornu. "You have your papers, I have those of
                     Louise. As you said, the marriage should be concluded as soon as possible;
                     besides, I have my reasons for pressing it."</p>
                  <p>"What reasons, captain?"</p>
                  <p>"They do not concern you."</p>
                  <p>"For all that, it seems to me——"</p>
                  <p>"Do you mistrust me?"</p>
                  <p>"Not the least, captain."</p>
                  <p>"You are informed that the motives I may have do not concern you, and that
                     should suffice."</p>
                  <p>"That is enough, good father."</p>
                  <p>"Now, do you consider yourself bound by what has passed this evening between
                     you and I, and Louise?"</p>
                  <p>"Certainly, ventrebleu! pardon, captain, I forgot——"</p>
                  <p>"If so, I release you from all obligation."</p>
                  <p>"From all obligation? I declare I do not understand——"</p>
                  <p>"It is easy to comprehend; I mean to say that you are still perfectly at
                     liberty either to espouse Louise, or to reject her hand."</p>
                  <p>"I espouse, captain, I espouse!"</p>
                  <p>"Stop a minute; perhaps you may change your mind: Louise is not my
                     daughter."</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Hein!</emph>—I beg a thousand pardons; but surely I have misunderstood
                     you."</p>
                  <p>"I repeat it: Louise is not my daughter."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, captain, how can you perpetrate such malicious jokes? At your age
                     too?"</p>
                  <p>"At my age, at my age! Upon my word, one would suppose that
                        <unclear>I</unclear> was some old dotard. At my age, monsieur Joseph Cornu,
                     men of<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7162-00000024"/> my temperament have a firm step
                     and a quick eye, and can put conscripts of your species through the exercise
                     with precision. But speaking seriously, I have said that I am not the father of
                     Louise, and I have told the truth. She is a young girl whom I took under my
                     care a few days after her birth, and whom I have raised as a child of my own.
                     Louise has grown up in this persuasion, without suspecting that she is only my
                     adopted daughter."</p>
                  <p>"And her real father, do you know him?"</p>
                  <p>"I could never lay hands on him, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sacrebleu!</foreign>
                     Oh! should I ever encounter him, by death! he shall not escape me."</p>
                  <p>"Good! I caught you there, captain; now you swear like a trooper."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I swear, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tete et sang!</foreign> I shall yet
                     swear more than once, if I fail to find the villain. But enough! You have now
                     heard a confession dictated by my conscience: and I ask you again, are you
                     disposed to abide by your engagement?"</p>
                  <p>"For ever, monsieur Morizot, forever. Eh! little does it matter to me whether
                     Louise be the child of you, or of the king of France. I shall not give her up,
                     I assure you. I espouse her, not her father. I should be very sorry, on my
                     faith, to espouse her father."</p>
                  <p>"Very well," said M. Morizot, "we are now near the chateau—Silence!"</p>
                  <p>They emerged from the avenue of firs which they had followed till then, and
                     found themselves in front of the residence of Ernest's uncle.</p>
                  <p>It was, truly, a rich and sumptuous habitation, overlooking the valley in all
                     directions. On the right and left, like sentry boxes, stood two pavilions,
                     which, situated in front of the main building, formed a sort of court, enclosed
                     with an iron railing, the bars of which were pointed like spears.</p>
                  <p>The merchant Forestelle, as we have already learnt from the old soldier, was
                     one of those men, less open perhaps than the ancient misers, in their sordid
                     rapacity, but the more dangerous, inasmuch as they possess the art, so common
                     in our age, of scattering money for the purpose of reaping it a hundred fold.
                     The uncle of Ernest was a native of the Vosges. He had left the country while
                     young, in consequence of an offence, of which he dreaded the results. As a
                     clerk in a banking house at the capital, he made some money, and being
                     persuaded, moreover, that the cause of his departure was forgotten, at the end
                     of ten years, M. Forestelle returned to his native mountains, with his wife, by
                     whom he had no children. In a short time, he amassed more than a million. We
                     must acknowledge that he won this fortune by ruining at least fifty families:
                     but the means which he put into operation were strictly legal, and as the
                     former banking clerk often said himself, 'he did nothing but what he had a
                     right to do.'</p>
                  <p>Every one knows that the chief occupation of the mountaineers of the Vosges, is
                     the sawing of timber. Now, until the arrival of M. Forestelle, this business
                     was carried on in the old-fashioned method. The peasants had their humble
                     contrivances, which were moved by the streams of the valley. The current turned
                     a wheel, and the wheel worked a saw: and by the aid of his own labor, the
                     mountaineer, at the end of his day's work, had some twenty or twenty-five
                     planks. With the profits of these, he could procure some black-bread, a coarse
                     woollen gown for his wife, and perchance a neckerchief for his daughter. On
                     Sundays, they were wont to attend mass at the village church, and after
                     performing their religious duties, they rested from the fatigues of the week
                     under the refreshing shade of the pines.</p>
                  <p>But the day came, when all these poor men were compelled to sit idle by their
                     silent mills. M. Forestelle procured from England a wonderful machine, which
                     alone dispatched more work than all the sawyers around.</p>
                  <p>Yet, we willingly say it, Madame Forestelle was an excellent woman, whose whole
                     life was devoted to the utmost possible reparation of the injury done by her
                     husband to the industry ot the neighborhood. Unknown to the merchant, she daily
                     visited their cottages, and rendered assistance to those unhappy people who
                     were without work. Not content with providing for their momentary necessities,
                     she turned her attention to the future. She deposited a certain sum annually in
                     the hands of the village priest. This sum was to pay a physician for attending
                     the sick, and a teacher charged with the instruction of the young mountaineers.
                     In this manner, all the poor children of a certain age, were enabled to obtain
                     situations in the city, in the service of the rich, and it also assisted those
                     who preferred learning a trade. In a word, Madame Forestelle was an angel of
                     benevolence in the eyes of the whole country; she alone saved her husband from
                     becoming the victim of the hatred so generally vowed against him.</p>
                  <p>As may be readily divined, M. Forestelle's disposition did not often inspire
                     him with the idea of a good action. It was his wife who forced him, so to say,
                     to provide for the education of his nephew, the only heir he would, probably,
                     ever have.</p>
                  <p>Ernest was now twenty-four years of age. He had studied law with the faculty of
                     Strasburg, and his name was inscribed among the list of advocates at the bar of
                     Saint-Die. But he did not practice, understanding that his aunt who loved him
                     as if he had been her own son, desired to have him always with her. For a month
                     past the merchant had resolved that Ernest should marry. In vain did Madame
                     Forestelle, who foresaw the repugnance of the young man to this marriage,
                     endeavor to change the determination of her spouse. Whenever she broached the
                     subject, she received the following reply: "Mademoiselle Victorine de Fontanges
                     is the richest heiress of the vicinage; four hundred thousand francs for her
                     portion, and still more in prospect." The merchan pretended that this was
                     unanswerable, and pursued his project, regardless of his wife's remarks, and
                     the evident displeasure of his nephew. The miser decided that so splendid a
                     dowry was well worth the pain of putting himself to expense. He sent letters of
                     invitation to the ladies de Fontanges, as well as to all the society of Raon<pb
                        n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7162-00000025"/> l'Etape and Saint-Dié. The marriage
                     once consummated, M. Forestelle designed retiring to Paris. Finding it
                     difficult to sell his country house and adjacent property, he put all into a
                     lottery, for the sum of two hundred and twenty-five thousand francs,
                     represented by fifteen hundred tickets, of one hundred and fifty francs each:
                     our estimable acquaintance, Monsieur Joseph Cornu, had purchased two, as our
                     readers may remember.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile, Captain Morizot, accompanied by the secretary of the justice of the
                     peace of Raon, approached, as we have said, the chateau of M. Forestelle.</p>
                  <p>The double, gates were thrown open, and the lamps shone to a great distance to
                     light the carriages through the entrance. The majority of the invited had not
                     yet arrived. M. Morizot and Joseph Cornu found in the saloon only five or six
                     young gentlemen of fashion, who hid either preceded the caleches, or
                     outstripped the tilburies.</p>
                  <p>Ernest, who stood in the midst of them, ran to welcome the captain.</p>
                  <p>"Good evening, my bold hunter," said M. Morizot, cordially shaking hands with
                     the young man. "When, like you, one has an uncle who owns a great part of our
                     mountain forests, one may burn powder in prohibited seasons. Come, now, tell us
                     your exploits."</p>
                  <p>"Alas! my dear monsieur Morizot, I disturb not the wild-boar or the
                     roe-buck."</p>
                  <p>"And why not, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">morbleu?</foreign> You have trouble on
                     your mind, it appears. Well, well, I will come one of these fine mornings, and
                     take you to a battue, and then, while shooting balls through the wolves of
                     Homeck, you can tell me your sorrows."</p>
                  <p>"Eh! very willingly, captain. My uncle wants to make me marry mademoiselle
                     Victorine de Fontanges, but I detest her!"</p>
                  <p>"Hush! take care, my friend, we have ears all around us here."</p>
                  <p>"What do I care?" cried the young man, "I have constantly declared to my uncle
                     that I will not obey his tyrannical orders. He has thought to frighten me, by
                     threatening to deprive me of his inheritance. Eh! my God, let him disinherit
                     me. I have no desire to buy a fortune at the price of misery."</p>
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Diable!</foreign> diable!" exclaimed the captain; "you
                     tell me sorrowful things, and they grieve me very much indeed; for I esteem
                     you. And here," he continued, pointing to Joseph Cornu, who stood in the centre
                     of the saloon in a posture of bewilderment; "I could wish that you were so
                     happy as that fellow. He will soon be my son-in-law, and he adores his
                     betrothed?"</p>
                  <p>M. Morizot had scarcely uttered these words, when Ernest seized his arm
                     violently, and looked at him with an air so profoundly desperate, that the
                     captain started.</p>
                  <p>"In the name of heaven, what have you done?" he demanded.</p>
                  <p>But, seeing the inquisitive approach, and among them the secretary, M. Morizot
                     replied in a loud tone:</p>
                  <p>"It seems to me, however, that you have nothing to cause you such trouble."</p>
                  <p>"Excuse me," stammered the young man; "I am so wretched myself, that the
                     happiness of others appears to me incredible. I suffer—oh, my God, how I
                     suffer! I hope, captain, that your daughter may be happy—but receive my
                     excuses: see, the guests surroud us; I must dissimulate, and remain quiet. We
                     will see each other again, my friend, we will see each other again."</p>
                  <p>Ernest withdrew.</p>
                  <p>M. Morizot struck his forehead with anxiety. His conversation with M.
                     Forestelle's nephew had given some consistency to a suspicion created in his
                     mind by the sudden melancholy of, his daughter at the moment he left the
                     cottage.</p>
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Morbleu!</foreign>" said he, speaking to himself; "I
                     am blind! I have exerted my memory in vain; never a word, never a look——Eh! my
                     fears are absurd! I have not the least proof to sustain my suspicions. Let it
                     be as it may, I shall press the marriage: it is a prudent measure which I want
                     not to renounce—but after all, one has seen stranger things. It is very
                     certain, that old miser of a M. Forestelle would never consent to what he would
                     call an unequal alliance. Humph! an unequal alliance—perhaps so, in point of
                     money."</p>
                  <p>The captain was engaged in these reflections, when M. Forestelle accosted him
                     in person. The visage of the merchant was purple with rage, and M. Morizot was
                     obliged to pass the greater part of the evening in listening to the
                     lamentations of the old miser, and his recriminations against Ernest. He soon
                     discovered a thing which rendered him completely easy as to the consequences of
                     the young man's resistance to the wishes of his uncle: it was, that Madame
                     Forestelle zealously took the part of Ernest. Consequently, it was improbable
                     that the merchant, in spite of his menaces, would ever decide upon
                     disinheriting his nephew.</p>
                  <p>We have too good a sense of propriety, and too good taste, to weary our readers
                     with a description pf a country ball. Suffice it to say, that the company,
                     which strutted through the saloon of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >parvenu,</foreign> consisted of persons residing among the mountains a
                     hundred leagues from Paris.</p>
                  <p>The refreshments affected the style named <foreign xml:lang="FRA">de
                        l'amphitryon.</foreign>
                  </p>
                  <p>Most of the dancers were free-spirited beauties, if one might judge from their
                     toilet. The women thought to make a figure, by evincing a, good opinion of
                     themselves, and the men, by exhibiting their impertinence and ignorance,
                     imagined themselves to have attained the highest degree of politeness and
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bon ton.</foreign> It must not be supposed that we
                     desire to direct an attack specially against the balls and parties of the
                     provinces: many of the Parisian circles might claim the better part of our
                     criticism.</p>
                  <p>In the midst of this throng, Ernest endeavored to conceal his mental tortures,
                     and was undoubtedly the only irreproachable man at the ball. He quitted the
                     fete but an instant, to have a secret conference in the gardens of the chateau,
                     with Frederic d'Ormeuil, and some other<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7162-00000026"
                     /> friends. A quarter of an hour afterwards he was doing the honors of his
                     uncle's ball room. He was cool and reserved, but polite, towards Mademoiselle
                     de Fontanges; inviting her to dance, without affectation, and managing with
                     perfect tact the delicacy of his position in regard to that young lady. The
                     merchant, observing this conduct in Ernest, felt a hope of triumph, and M.
                     Morizot himself sincerely believed that the young man had exaggerated his
                     dislike.</p>
                  <p>Towards midnight, the captain, thinking it time to retire, sought in the saloon
                     for the, secretary of the justice of the peace.</p>
                  <p>Joseph Cornu was not there to be found, but M. Morizot, visiting the gardens as
                     a last resort, discovered him under an avenue of lime trees, sitting with his
                     head between his hands, and sobbing bitterly.</p>
                  <p>"Ah! my poor youth, why do you weep?" said the captain to him. "I weep—yes, it
                     is true, I weep—instead of going to fight them, and coming to blows in the full
                     saloon! I have no soul—I have no blood in these veins—I am a coward!"</p>
                  <p>"But, explain yourself—what the devil do you mean? Of whom do you speak?"</p>
                  <p>"Of whom do I speak, captain—of the friends of M. Ernest. Oh, why did I not
                     kill them—that Frederic d'Ormeuil above all."</p>
                  <p>"Come, be calm," said M. Morizot, gently striking him on the shoulder.</p>
                  <p>"Be calm! that is easy for you to say—be calm! When I have torn them to pieces
                     with my nails, not before. Fine rascals that he has for friends, M. Ernest.
                     Yes, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">certes,</foreign> I felicitate him upon them with
                     all my heart. Picture to yourself that here, in this place, they have conspired
                     to carry off Louise!"</p>
                  <p>"To carry off Louise!" cried M. Morizot, who felt the hot blood mantling over
                     his face. "The wretches! But no, you are mistaken—I cannot believe it."</p>
                  <p>"Good! You are like them: they also pretended that I was mistaken, that I had
                     misunderstood them. Be it so, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ventrebleu!</foreign> I
                     have no ears, I am a dunce, a cabbage-head, a simpleton—I am any thing you
                     like."</p>
                  <p>The poor secretary redoubled his sobs, and struck his forehead with
                     despair.</p>
                  <p>"Come on!" cried the captain, suddenly. "Follow me. Let us confront them, and
                     force an explanation in my presence."</p>
                  <p>"This instant!" cried Joseph, jumping up with a tone of savage joy.</p>
                  <p>And he would have rushed into the chateau, but M. Morizot held him back.</p>
                  <p>"No," said he, "we must do nothing to occasion unnecessary scandal. They would
                     be sure to deny it, and every one would condemn our violence. It would be best
                     for you to relate to me all that occurred, all that was said. Carry off Louise!
                     My God, it must be a dream! They wish to dishonor the maiden, they reserve for
                     her the same fate as befell her unhappy mother. Oh, my brain reels!"</p>
                  <p>"Hold, captain," said Joseph, who rapidly regained his senses; "we should do
                     well, to run to the cottage; for that damned Frederic d'Ormeuil, and the rest,
                     said that the thing would take place to-morrow morning—it may be that, since I
                     have discovered the plot, this very night, during your absence——"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes, let us run," cried M. Morizot. "Death to them, if they have had the
                     audacity—Oh, yes, I will kill them!"</p>
                  <p>The chateau of M. Forestelle was soon left behind them.</p>
                  <p>They walked swiftly through that same avenue of pines, whose foliage we
                     described as illumined by the silvery rays of the moon. Without relaxing his
                     pace, M. Morizot said to the secretary:</p>
                  <p>"You have not yet given me any particulars. Was Ernest with his friends when
                     you overheard their conspiracy?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no, I do not accuse him; he is an honorable young man, and I am very
                     certain that if he had been there——Hear how I discovered the secret. I had
                     quitted the ball, where I was not comfortable. All the dandies looked on me
                     with disdain, and the ladies were always engaged whenever I asked them to dance
                     with me—the true reasons, captain, because I had not polished boots and yellow
                     gloves. At last I concluded to take the air, and it was then that I formed the
                     idea of walking in the gardens. On entering the alley of lime trees, I
                     perceived M. Ernest regain the saloon—so you may see, captain, that he was not
                     among the plotters. The others had awaited his departure to arrange the plan of
                     their villany: it is evident."</p>
                  <p>"Humph!" said M. Morizot, shaking his head; "never mind, go on."</p>
                  <p>"An instant after, I heard, about two paces from me, whisperings and bursts of
                     suppressed laughter. I approached, and heard a conversation that made me
                     tremble. 'You well know the charming Louise,' said Frederic d'Ormeuil to a new
                     comer, 'she who is named the Rose of the Valley.' 'Yes,' replied the other.
                     'Ah, well, it as all right; we have no more scruples, and we will carry her
                     off.' 'When shall it be done?' 'Peste! as soon as possible; to-morrow, if an
                     opportunity offers: for it seems they want to give her to that fool, Joseph
                     Cornu.' You see, captain, they abused me finely.''</p>
                  <p>"Do not dwell on such trifling things; let us hear the result."</p>
                  <p>"Carry her off?' said another; 'that is no easy task, and you will expose
                     yourselves to the sabre of the grumbler.' Of the grumbler!—that is what they
                     called you, my future father—Of the grumbler' the insolent scoundrels!"</p>
                  <p>"Proceed," said M. Morizot.</p>
                  <p>"Frederic d'Ormeuil then advanced a statement, of which I do not believe one
                     word. Suspect mademoiselle Louise! She who is candour and virtue itself. Never!
                     I lay my head against a block of wood, that I yet prove him to have lied like a
                     dog."</p>
                  <p>"You make me ready to die with impatience, with your slowness," cried the
                     captain.</p>
                  <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7162-00000027"/>
                  <p>"In brief, to him who had threatened him with your sabre, Frederic d'Ormeuil
                     replied: 'Never fear that; the lady's on our side. For the last two months, we
                     have had the most delightful interviews with the lovely Rose; we have taught
                     her to read. When the father is absent, we are notified—it is done by a little
                     telegraphic signal. And to-morrow, if the good man quits the cottage, we will
                     wait for the young girl in the vicinity of the Strasburg road. The diligence
                     passes at eight o'clock in the evening—two seats inside, hurry the
                     postillion—by day light we shall be over the frontier; and it would be the very
                     devil, if, on the other side of the bridge at Kehl, and under the shades of the
                     Black Forest, one could not prosecute his love affairs without disturbance.' At
                     that moment, captain, I dashed like a fury into the midst of the circle; and,
                     can you believe it, they had the impudence to mock at my angry reproaches. 'Eh!
                     where do you spring from, M. Cornu?' 'What a mouth you make! you look like a
                     madman.' 'Has a bee stung you, or do you dream and walk in your sleep?'
                     Gentlemen, your hypocrisy increases your villany. 'Oh, oh,' said Frederic
                     d'Ormeuil, 'I think M. Cornu insults us. <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >Dame!</foreign> the poor devil's afraid we shall pluck his rose.' 'Some one
                     will furnish him with roses.' 'So then, monsieur Cornu, you are going to take a
                     wife? The name you bear is an evil omen.' 'Good by, monsieur Cornu; our
                     respects to madame Cornu.' 'Don't let her wear the breeches, monsieur Cornu.'
                     And a thousand other indecent pleasantries, which they flung in my face. They
                     then dispersed, one after the other; but, as for me, captain, I remained
                     there—dumb with astonishment, and shedding the tears of despair."</p>
                  <p>M. Morizot kept onward, plunged in a deep revery, and wiping away, at
                     intervals, the sweat which ran down his temples in large drops.</p>
                  <p>"Look you, good father," added the young man, with a trembling voice, "what
                     think you of all this?"</p>
                  <p>"I think, my lad, that Providence, by permitting you to discover the design of
                     these wretches, has determined to save Louise; be calm, therefore—I am so."</p>
                  <p>"So then, you are of my opinion, captain, that Frederic d'Ormeuil has uttered a
                     scandalous lie. No, I cannot think that Louise——"</p>
                  <p>M. Morizot interrupted him, taking him by the hand, and squeezing it with all
                     his might.</p>
                  <p>"If Louise were guilty, see you—if she were guilty, I would never trust any
                     thing in this world again: I would not trust the word of an angel—I would not
                     trust God himself!"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, captain."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, it is blasphemous, I know it. <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Eh bien!</foreign>
                     I will blaspheme and curse heaven itself, if heaven permits innocence to beam
                     on a countenance, merely as a mask for deceit."</p>
                  <p>"It is impossible!" cried Joseph.</p>
                  <p>"Indeed, you are right, my friend, it is impossible. Louise, poor child, I am
                     far from suspecting thy pure and gentle virtues. We have arrived at the
                     cottage," continued M. Morizot, "now listen to me: the night is fine, and you
                     have nothing to fear from either wolves or robbers, so you had better return to
                     town."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, captain. It is true my old aunt has not seen me return, and I am sure she
                     is in anxiety."</p>
                  <p>"That is not all, my lad: you know it will henceforth be impossible for me to
                     leave home."</p>
                  <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Par Dieu,</foreign> take good care of it,
                     captain."</p>
                  <p>"I ought to go to Raon to draw the quarterly instalment of my pension out of
                     the treasury: you will do me the favor to obtain the money, and give in
                     exchange this receipt, which I have prepared."</p>
                  <p>"Enough, good father. To-morrow, after my office is closed, I will hasten to
                     bring you the money."</p>
                  <p>"Good night, my lad," said the captain.</p>
                  <p>Joseph took the road, which passed in front of the cottage. As to the old
                     soldier, he opened the door, lit his lamp, and softly mounted the stairs
                     leading to the garret. When near the chamber of Louise, he stopped and
                     listened. All was still—he heard nothing but the breathing of the sleeping
                     girl.</p>
                  <p>"She sleeps," thought he, "she sleeps the sleep of angels. Oh, my daughter, for
                     I feel an inexpressible joy in giving thee that name, may innocent visions
                     alone surround thy pillow. Sleep on, dear child, sleep on: I watch over
                     thee."</p>
                  <p>The captain entered his chamber, which adjoined that of Louise.</p>
                  <p>But it was impossible for M. Morizot to sleep during the remainder of the
                     night. Slumber fled from his eyelids, and painful reflections obstinately
                     presented themselves to his mind.</p>
                  <p>After Joseph's narration, the captain had easily divined a thing which escaped
                     the simple mind of his intended son-in-law. It was, that in this affair,
                     Frederic d'Ormeuil was nothing more than the counsellor of Ernest Forestelle.
                     The nephew of the merchant loved Louise, M. Morizot had not a doubt of it, and
                     that was the secret of the young man's repugnance to the brilliant marriage
                     which his uncle had projected. Forgetful of the principles of honor and
                     delicacy, to which he had been Heretofore obedient, Ernest harkened to nothing
                     but the voice of passion. The merchant would never permit him to marry a poor
                     fortuneless girl; then he would run off with Louise, he would execute the plan
                     traced out by a dissipated friend. The captain might well shudder to think that
                     pure and gentle creature, whom he had so long cherished with paternal
                     affection, would have been lost for ever, if accident had not led to the
                     discovery of a shameful plot. But how had the love of Ernest been excited?
                     Could it be possible that Louise had received secret visits from the young man?
                     The captain could not believe it. If the heart of the young girl had been fixed
                     upon another, she would certainly have rejected Joseph Cornu: therefore she did
                     not love the nephew of M. Forestelle. Yet the assertions of Frederic
                        d'Ormeuil<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7162-00000028"/> were positive. Taking
                     advantage of the captain's absence, a signal was to be made: if Louise is not
                     guilty, she is at least deceived.</p>
                  <p>M. Morizot thought over all the means which a young man like Ernest could have
                     at his disposal to ensnare a credulous and inexperienced girl. He resolved to
                     clear up his suspicions, and discover the means employed. Pretending to Louise
                     that he must return to town, upon business which he had not been able to
                     arrange on the preceding day, M. Morizot left the cottage, and took the road to
                     Raon. But soon retracing his steps, he placed himself in a good position for
                     observation, near his own house.</p>
                  <p>It was not long before he perceived Louise wave, from her window, the white
                     handkerchief, which Ernest could see from the chateau.</p>
                  <p>In about a quarter of an hour the young girl and the merchant's nephew found
                     themselves seated under the same arbor which had sheltered their previous
                     meetings. Instantly approaching, without noise, and concealed by the dense
                     foliage, the captain was enabled to hear every thing, without being
                     visible.</p>
                  <p>"M. Ernest," said Louise, with emotion, "my conduct until this day has been
                     culpable, and I ought not to have accepted your kind offer to teach me to read
                     and write. Yes, I am now sensible of it; I have been disobedient to the will of
                     my father. Whatever may be the motives which induce him to keep me in
                     ignorance, I ought to respect them."</p>
                  <p>"So, then, Louise, I shall see you no more!" cried the young man, with
                     anguish.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, always, as usual. Only, when you cease to give me lessons, it will be
                     useless for me to make a signal, and you can come without secrecy, whenever you
                     think proper."</p>
                  <p>"Louise, Louise! you plunge me in despair."</p>
                  <p>"I plunge yon in despair, do you say? My God, how pale you look. Ah, you have
                     reason; I forgot that you will soon be free no more. You are about to marry,
                     monsieur Ernest?"</p>
                  <p>"They have told you this news then, have they?" demanded the young man, with a
                     trembling voice.</p>
                  <p>"Yes—I have been informed by my father, that you are to espouse mademoiselle de
                     Fontanges."</p>
                  <p>"Undeceive yourself. She shall never be my wife. My uncle may disinherit me, he
                     may drive me from his house—little do I care. I will not yield to him the right
                     of tyrannising over my heart, and poisoning the remainder of my life, by
                     forcing me to unite myself with mademoiselle de Fontanges, whom I do not love,
                     whom I cannot love."</p>
                  <p>The captain had a great mind to show himself. Nevertheless, reassured by the
                     innocent language of Louise, he resolved to remain in concealment, and listen a
                     little longer.</p>
                  <p>"And why did you tell me yesterday that you were unhappy, monsieur Ernest?"
                     responded the young girl.</p>
                  <p>"But you, Louise, you are happy——"</p>
                  <p>"Happy," cried she, "when you suffer!"</p>
                  <p>"My sorrows should not trouble your bosom," replied the young man with a bitter
                     smile. "M. Joseph Cornu, perhaps, in the capacity of your intended spouse,
                     would have the right to require an account of such compassion."</p>
                  <p>"It is strange," said the young girl, "you tell me this with an air that I have
                     never known you put on towards me before. If my betrothal does not please you,
                     I will entreat my father to break it."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed, Louise! then you do not love him for whom they destine you!"</p>
                  <p>"Pardon me," she replied, "Joseph would be a good husband. Yet, if you must
                     needs know all, I should be as well satisfied to remain as I am."</p>
                  <p>"Poor child," cried the young man, "in your innocent simplicity, you do not
                     understand the nature of your own impressions. No, Louise, you do not love your
                     betrothed, you do not love him, I declare to you. Oh, could you but know what
                     great joy this thought affords me."</p>
                  <p>"So, then, you will be no more unhappy now?" said she with a tremulous voice;
                     for Ernest had seized her hand, and passionately pressed it to his lips: and
                     Louise, at this action of the young man, experienced an indescribable emotion
                     through her whole being.</p>
                  <p>M. Morizot stepped closer to the arbor, but still kept himself concealed. Our
                     readers, perhaps, will consider that in this he showed too much forbearance. We
                     answer, that the captain, a man of sense, evidently had reasons for allowing
                     the conversation to be prolonged, with which we shall become acquainted more
                     slowly.</p>
                  <p>"Louise, hear me," replied Ernest, "and judge for yourself, whether I should
                     obey my uncle by marrying mademoiselle de Fontanges. It would be the misery of
                     my whole life, for I love another—another, whose simple virtues, and innocent
                     graces, have charmed my heart. But she whom I love is poor, and they would
                     never consent to my making her my wife. Judge of my despair! Oh, if I could be
                     sure that she would deign to return my love. If in one of her looks, in one of
                     her smiles, I could read <foreign xml:lang="FRA">hope!</foreign>"</p>
                  <p>"And why should she not love you, monsieur Ernest? You, so kind, so
                     generous."</p>
                  <p>"Why, Louise? Ah, it is because I have never dared to tell her of my love. It
                     is because she is so calm and so lovely in her innocence, that, till now, I
                     have scrupled to awaken in her bosom a sentiment which, perhaps, would prove
                     her torture, as it has mine."</p>
                  <p>"Do I know her?" asked the young girl, glancing timidly at Ernest.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Louise," he replied with agitation, at the same time drawing forth a
                     paper hidden in his breast. "But stop—this letter will tell you her name. You
                     will find expressed in it, all the emotions which my lips refuse to utter—for I
                     tremble In her presence, and I can but imperfectly recite what my heart
                     dictates. In this letter, Louise, I ask<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7162-00000029"
                     /> of you a favor—a favor on which depends the happiness of my existence. Oh,
                     promise me you will grant it, Louise."</p>
                  <p>With these words, he handed the letter to the young girl; but at that moment
                     the captain appeared at the entrance of the arbor.</p>
                  <p>Had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of Ernest, it had caused him less alarm
                     than this sudden apparition, at the very moment when he was attempting to
                     consummate a seduction, against which all his upright and honorable principles
                     had hitherto revolted. As for Louise, she sprang up, blushing and trembling
                     from the oaken bench on which she had been sitting. M. Morizot, without seeming
                     to observe her agitation, approached and tenderly embraced her; then turning
                     towards the nephew of M. Forestelle:</p>
                  <p>"If I am not mistaken, my children," said he, "you were in the course of making
                     confidential disclosures, and chance has led me to hear part of your
                     conversation. But I do not suppose, monsieur Ernest, that Louise has the power
                     to be useful to you, and I think you will be wiser by placing yourself under my
                     instruction. So then, my friend, just give me that letter, which doubtless
                     indicates the nature of the service you require."</p>
                  <p>Speaking in this way, M. Morizot snatched the letter, which Ernest still held
                     in his hand, and the young man dared not make the least resistance.</p>
                  <p>"Ho! ho!" cried the captain, "you will be much less timid with me. With men,
                     all these manœuvers become superfluous. To the devil with such bad
                     writing!"</p>
                  <p>And he tore the letter into a thousand fragments.</p>
                  <p>"Mercy, captain, mercy!" cried the young man. "Such generosity——"</p>
                  <p>"Tell me, Louise," interrupted M. Morizot, "do you know that it was not polite
                     to let me go away without my breakfast? I felt this neglect while climbing the
                     mountain: my stomach cried out like the very devil, and my legs refused to
                     work. My faith, said I, we must return! A hungry stomach is no incentive to
                     business. Prepare a cutlet for me very quickly, and a slice of ham. Go, my
                     child, go, do not let me last long."</p>
                  <p>Thus, he hurried Louise out of the arbor. Remaining alone with Ernest, M.
                     Morizot cast upon him a look so full of reproach and sorrow, that the young man
                     fell suppliant on his knees and exclaimed:</p>
                  <p>"Pardon me, captain, oh! pardon me!"</p>
                  <p>"Your fault is very great, Ernest. You see I know all. I am not even ignorant
                     of the contents of that letter which I tore to pieces, to save you from the
                     shame of having it read in your presence. You wanted to entice Louise into the
                     borders of the Strasburg road: you wanted to carry off my child—my only joy—my
                     only consolation on earth! You would, without compunction, have broken the
                     heart of one who has shown you so much friendship—so much confidence! Hear me!
                     I am about to relate to you my history—a terrible history which will warn you
                     of all the evils which a seduction may occasion."</p>
                  <p>Ernest was paler than death, and, perhaps, he would have preferred the anger of
                     the captain to that touching goodness, which made him feel more sensibly the
                     unworthiness of his conduct.</p>
                  <p>"It all happened a long time ago," continued the old soldier, "yet my heart
                     still bleeds. It is an incurable wound! I lived in this part of the country,
                     Ernest, and I loved a young girl, pure and virtuous, as she whom you this day
                     intended to seduce. This young girl was named Clemence: we were mutually
                     engaged, and the day drew near on which the priest was to celebrate our
                     marriage, when a decree of the Emperor separated me from my betrothed, and
                     dragged me away to the icy steppes of Russia. At the moment of my separation
                     from Clemence, as she burst into tears, at that melancholy parting hour, I said
                     to her: Hear me! guard my memory fondly, and I will soon return decorated with
                     the star of heroes! She promised me she would, alas! and I went to battle,
                     Ernest. I like not to speak of myself! But on the field of battle at Moscow,
                     Napoleon named me captain, and decorated me with his own hand."</p>
                  <p>The old soldier, while pronouncing the name of the Emperor, uncovered his bald
                     head. A tear trickled gently down his sun burnt cheek, and during some seconds,
                     he maintained silence.</p>
                  <p>"You know," he at last continued, "how disastrous was the close of that
                     campaign. Harassed by the barbarous hordes—wasted with fatigue, and almost
                     universally treated as an enemy, I was two years absent from France. But the
                     remembrance of her I loved, sustained my courage. At last I returned. I ran to
                     the home of Clemence, who lived with one of her relations, in Saint-Dié. There,
                     my friend, I received in my heart that wound of which I speak to you.—Clemence
                     was seduced, dishonored, disgraced! She had forgotten our vows to listen to the
                     language of seduction. A villain, a wretch—Jules Palaisseau was his name. I
                     have sought that man every where, without ever being able to find him, to spit
                     in his face, and challenge him to a duel that must end in the death of one of
                     us!—That wretch, I say, employed the most artful means to deduce Clemence. At
                     first, he put into her hands those dangerous books, which excite delirium of
                     the imagination, perverting the principles, and corrupting the heart. Then he
                     strived to convince her that the object of her first love had perished like
                     many others, and been buried in the frozen North. But no sooner had he
                     triumphed over the resistance of the unfortunate being, than he shamefully
                     abandoned her, and disappeared. I returned to find Clemence expiring with
                     sorrow and shame, after having given birth to a daughter——."</p>
                  <p>"And that child?" demanded the young man, with a trembling voice, for he
                     foresaw the conclusion of the narration in the looks of the captain.</p>

                     courage to curse her, but I promised Clemence that I would protect the poor
                     creature she had brought into the world. I have faithfully performed my
                     promise, by evincing unlimited affection for Louise, and shielding her from
                     those dangers which ruined her unhappy mother. And you, Ernest, you to whom I
                     attributed honorable sentiments——"</p>
                  <p>"Oh! do not crush me, I conjure you!"</p>
                  <p>"No my friend, your tears are a sufficient proof of your repentance. Misled by
                     wicked counsels, you have erred for an instant: but you will return into the
                     right path, and I fear no more attacks by you. M. Forestelle, you well know, is
                     inflexible: he will never permit you to marry a portionless girl, whose birth,
                     it must be avowed, is tarnished with shame."</p>
                  <p>"But," cried the young man, "I love Louise! and M. Forestelle is not my father!
                     What matters his consent? what matters his gold? I, also, am poor, captain, and
                     I demand the hand of your adopted daughter."</p>
                  <p>"Ernest," replied M. Morizot, in a grave and solemn tone: "the sacrifice you
                     would accomplish to-day, you might regret hereafter, and the happiness of
                     Louise is too precious to be exposed to danger by accepting an offer prompted
                     by enthusiasm and passion. If, yesterday, before hearing the counsel of your
                     friends, and preparing to execute it, you had asked me for the hand of my
                     daughter, your cause would have been stamped with an air of nobleness and
                     frankness which at this moment, it does not possess. I regret, Ernest, to be
                     obliged to speak to you in this manner. Although my regard for you continues, I
                     cannot yield you my confidence. Besides, Joseph Cornu has my word, and you are
                     not ignorant that the word of an Imperial soldier is sacred!"</p>
                  <p>The captain had concluded these words, and taken the young man affectionately
                     by the hand, when Louise came to announce that breakfast was ready.</p>
                  <p>At the sight of Ernest, all bathed in tears, she ran to him in an agitated
                     manner, and inquired the cause of his grief.</p>
                  <p>"My child," volunteered the captain, "M. Forestelle's nephew informs me that he
                     is about to take a long journey, which will, doubtless, long detain him far
                     from the Vosges. On the eve of parting with us, the sorrow he exhibits, proves
                     that he reciprocates that friendship, of which we have given him so many
                     evidences. Farewell, Ernest, my friend; take courage! you know your duty."</p>
                  <p>"Yes I understand you," replied Ernest, in the midst of his sobs. "Adieu,
                     Louise! adieu for ever!"</p>
                  <p>And, throwing a last look upon the poor girl, whom these words had stricken to
                     the heart, he departed in indescribable agitation.</p>
                  <p>During the rest of the day, he roamed about in the most desolate places on the
                     mountain, meditating whether he had not better put an end to his life, since
                     Louise, and happiness were together lost.</p>
                  <p>Towards night, the domestics of his uncle's chateau, who had been ordered to
                     make search, found him on the brink of a precipice, pale, out of breath, his
                     hair in disorder, and measuring with his eye the profundity of the abyss
                     beneath him. They brought him home in a state of frightful madness, and the
                     same night, Ernest was attacked with inflammation of the brain, which reduced
                     him to the verge of</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                  <p>NEARLY six weeks had elapsed since the occurrence of the events we have
                     related. The warm breezes and mild showers of June, swept over the mountain
                     gorges, and hastened to maturity the crops of the valley. Under the trenchant
                     scythe of the peasant, the long grass fell with the flowers that bloomed among
                     it; the white daisy, the sky-blue <foreign xml:lang="LAT">myosotis,</foreign>
                     and that dazzling ranunculus of the meadows, the golden button. Grass and
                     flowers are heaped up together, with rakes, by troops of young brown-shouldered
                     girls, who gaily frolic, and sing in chorus the songs of the hay-making.</p>
                  <p>Joseph Cornu advanced along a road, bordered with high shrubs and thick hedges,
                     which soon conducted him into the midst of that animated scene.</p>
                  <p>We must needs say, that a great misfortune had happened to the poor secretary;
                     for his cheeks, usually so blooming, had lost their lively color, and, more
                     singular still, for the last two days he had not appeared in his office. The
                     evening before, he went from Raon l'Etape to Saint-Dié, expressly to
                     interrogate Frederic d'Ormeuil. Resolved, at all hazards, to clear up his
                     suspicions, he had overcome the repugnance he felt to asking an interview with
                     that young coxcomb, whose derisive jocularities still rankled in his heart.
                     From the friend of Ernest, Joseph learnt a thing which M. Morizot had not yet
                     thought proper to divulge, and which redoubled the fears of the intended
                     son-in-law to such a degree that, regardless of a letter from his patron,
                     reproaching him severely for his first irregularity, he started next morning to
                     the cottage, instead of returning to his work. There, he found neither the
                     captain, nor his daughter; but the old domestic, whom they had left to guard
                     the house, informed him that M. Morizot had gone to superintend the
                     hay-harvest, and had taken Louise with him.</p>
                  <p>Joseph Cornu, therefore, proceeded to the meadow. Thanks to the functions of
                     his employer, the secretary of the justice of the peace was well known to all
                     the mountaineers for five or six leagues around. As soon as he entered the
                     field, he found himself surrounded by the mowers and hay-makers, who left their
                     work to shake hands with him.</p>
                  <p>"Good day, monsieur Joseph Cornu."</p>
                  <p>"How is your health?"</p>
                  <p>"And the love affairs and the marriage? Are there any impediments iments? The
                     captain is as cross as a legion of devils, and mademoiselle becomes more
                     melancholy every day."</p>
                  <p>"See here," cried the hay-makers in their turn, "when shall you let us have a
                     dance?"</p>
                  <p>"I have bought a lace scarf."</p>
                  <p>"And I a red petticoat."</p>
                  <p>"It's not right to put off the wedding so long."</p>
                  <p>To all these exclamations, to all these inquiries, the young man answered only
                     by a melancholy sigh, and walked on towards M. Morizot, whom he perceived at
                     some distance.</p>
                  <p>"Ha! is it you?" cried the captain.</p>
                  <p>Yes, good father."</p>
                  <p>"And your office?"</p>
                  <p>"My office," replied Joseph, "I trouble myself very little about, just now. The
                     justice of the peace will scold, will be very angry. If he chooses, he may
                     deprive me of my situation—but it is all the same whether one dies of hunger,
                     or of any thing else—it is equally death."</p>
                  <p>"Come, Joseph, show a little philosophy. You know, my lad, it is not my fault
                     if your marriage is delayed. Really, you are wrong to afflict yourself in this
                     way. Louise is sad—she invents pretexts, she creates delays—but it shall all be
                     arranged, I promise you."</p>
                  <p>Joseph shook his head with an air of incredulity.</p>
                  <p>"Where is your daughter, captain? I must speak to her."</p>
                  <p>M. Morizot pointed to a clump of alders and live aspens, which dipped their
                     branches in a neighboring stream. Joseph Cornu approached this sort of oasis,
                     where dwelt a delightful coolness. He found the young girl seated in the shade.
                     On the grass by her side she had laid down her large straw hat and light
                     hay-rake. Louise seemed wrapt in profound revery. She rested her feet in the
                     flowing waters, which whirled around in playful eddies, and caressed with their
                     white foam the green leaves and large flower of the water-lily.</p>
                  <p>At the secretary's approach, Louise raised her head and shuddered. Her face
                     became almost immediately of an ashy paleness; yet she extended her hand to the
                     young man. He gently pressed that hand in his own, and murmured in a voice that
                     trembled with emotion:</p>
                  <p>"Louise, it is now more than a month, since you engaged to be my wife; yet,
                     every day, you beg me to wait—you incessantly find new reasons to retard our
                     marriage. Ah, well! I must now lay my heart open to you. All this proves that I
                     was deceived in imagining that you loved me. Was I not, Louise? Fear nothing. I
                     must show a little philosophy, as the captain just said, and if you do not love
                     me, it would be kinder to extinguish my hopes at once, than to destroy them one
                     by one. That would make my sufferings too great to be borne."</p>
                  <p>The tone in which Joseph Cornu delivered these words, deeply affected the young
                     girl.</p>
                  <p>"You have the promise of my father," she replied; "you can your self fix the
                     day of our union,—I will obey."</p>
                  <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7162-00000032"/>
                  <p>"But it is not enough for you to obey," cried the secretary, "it is important
                     that you should acknowledge why you have interposed delays to the celebration
                     of our marriage; why you are so sad and thoughtful; for look you, Louise, I
                     wish not to buy my happiness at the price of a solitary tear of yours."</p>
                  <p>"Oh," said the young girl, "you have a noble heart. I shall learn to love you,
                     Joseph, for you deserve to be loved; only, I conjure you, have a little
                     patience."</p>
                  <p>"Alas!" the poor youth replied, "my suspicions were just; you do not love me;
                     and if you wait until love comes, we are not at the end of our troubles. One
                     party must be injured. I was very silly to imagine that you could have
                     affection for me. I am nothing but a mountaineer slightly polished. I have a
                     good heart, to be sure; but a good heart alone, without the advantages of
                     talent and education, without fine manners, without dress, is a very small
                     matter in the eyes of women."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! monsieur," said the young girl, casting on him a look full of
                     reproach.</p>
                  <p>"I know," continued Joseph, "that you have not a shade of coquetry. You are a
                     simple daughter of the mountains, gentle, timid, innocent; but you can see as
                     clearly as another, Louise; and you have been enabled to make comparisons not
                     at all to my advantage."</p>
                  <p>With these words he regarded her fixedly. She trembled, blushed, and her
                     agitation completely subdued the young man, who until then had not lost all
                     hope.</p>
                  <p>He placed his hand upon his heart, to repress its violent pulsations.</p>
                  <p>As to the adopted daughter of the captain, she saw with terror that Joseph had
                     discovered the secret of her heart—that secret which she had been so slow to
                     comprehend herself, and which the parting words of M. Forestelle's nephew had
                     revealed to her with the rapidity of the lightning, that rends the dark veil of
                     the thunder-cloud. Louise having divined that Ernest loved her, felt, almost
                     immediately, in her turn, that she loved him, and from that moment dreaded the
                     thought of her approaching union. The captain observed the repugnance of the
                     young girl, and induced her to confess her secret, with that paternal kindness
                     which he had so uniformly displayed. To combat her love, he made use of those
                     arguments whose justice the mind admits, but the heart vigorously opposes.
                     Louise promised to follow her father's counsels, only entreating him to give
                     her time to forget. This was contrary to the opinion of M. Morizot, who
                     reasonably thought that marriage and the tenderness of a young husband would be
                     the most infallible means of forgetfulness. Yet he was unwilling to violate the
                     sorrow of Louise, and often he even assisted the young girl to color, with
                     artful pretexts, the obstacles which she opposed to the consummation of her
                     union with Joseph Cornu. But that personage, in spite of the captain's
                     precautions, was not slow to comprehend the true cause of the delay. The
                     unfortunate secretary had already read his doom on the countenance of the young
                     girl, for that countenance knew no deceit; and if he again came to interrogate
                     Louise, it was in order to obey that imperious voice, which, under the most
                     terrible apprehensions of disappointment, and amid the greatest misfortunes of
                     existence, cries incessantly in the ear of man—"Hope!"</p>
                  <p>For some minutes Joseph and the captain's daughter kept mournful silence.</p>
                  <p>"Louise," at length the young man continued, "I took a step yesterday, which
                     has cost me a great deal. Yet I no longer regret it, since it has enabled me to
                     bring you news of M. Ernest."</p>
                  <p>"What do you say?" cried the young girl, blushing scarlet.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, do not disturb yourself, mademoiselle; and above all, do not think that
                     there is a snare in my words. I know that M. Ernest Forestelle is enamored of
                     you, and I believe, moreover, that I have discovered the cause of your grief;
                     for many nights have I passed in reflection. At first I was jealous; I
                     experienced the transports of rage; and if I closed my eyes a few moments, I
                     instantly dreamed of blood. It was very hard to renounce you without breaking
                     my heart. At last I said to myself, Do you sincerely love the captain's
                     daughter? Yes. Then you should, above all things else try to make her happy;
                     otherwise your love would be nothing but selfishness. You now understand the
                     reason why I have desired to penetrate the mystery you concealed from me,
                     mademoiselle. If the object of your affections had been that Frederic
                     D'Ormeuil, I would have killed him without remorse, for he is unworthy of you.
                     But since it is M. Ernest whom you love, Louise, I have no more to say, and I
                     clearly see that you prefer him to me."</p>
                  <p>Whilst the secretary spoke thus, the young girl at first rose, pale and
                     trembling; but as soon as she comprehended the sublimity of Joseph's love—as
                     soon as she saw all that was noble and truly good in his conduct—she reproached
                     herself with the sufferings she had made that generous heart endure.</p>
                  <p>"Joseph," she said, "I am very culpable towards you. I have delayed the
                     execution of a solemn and sacred promise. Yes, I must confess, I love M.
                     Ernest; but I know not how that love has been implanted in my heart. When I
                     wanted to resist it, it was too late. But now Ernest is gone—I shall never see
                     him again—absence will close this wound—and, Joseph, if you still think me
                     worthy to be your wife, here is my hand. I could not yield it to one more
                     justly entitled to universal esteem."</p>
                  <p>"Stop, Louise, stop! Poor child, do you think, then, that love can be so easily
                     blotted out, and disappear? Oh, no, Louise, I understood it too well. God
                     forbid that I should accept the sacrifice. Yet, when you have heard what
                     remains to be told, if you still persevere in the same sentiments—if you still
                     say to me, 'Here is my hand!'—I will accept, Louise, with intoxicating
                     pleasure; and I will love you so, my God! I will love you so, that it will be
                     almost impossible to dislike me."</p>
                  <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7162-00000033"/>
                  <p>"Speak," said the young girl, turning towards the secretary her lovely eyes,
                     bathed in tears.</p>
                  <p>"Well, then, know that M. Ernest has not gone away, as they have allowed you to
                     believe, doubtless intentionally."</p>
                  <p>The captain's daughter became still more pale, and her knees failed to support
                     her.</p>
                  <p>"Look you!" said Joseph, with an accent of sorrow, "you are thinking of nothing
                     now but that you may perhaps see him again. I said truly, Louise, love cannot
                     be cured."</p>
                  <p>The young girl buried her face between her hands, and dared not look on her
                     betrothed.</p>
                  <p>"That is not all," continued the secretary, who struggled violently to overcome
                     his emotion. "As I told you, I have visited Frederic d'Ormeuil. He knows that I
                     detest him, and seeing that I demanded revelations, he strived to make such as
                     might harrow my feelings. I have learnt from him that M. Ernest asked the
                     captain for your hand, and that, rendered desperate by refusal, the poor young
                     man resolved to terminate his existence by precipitating himself from the
                     Black-Rock to the bottom of the abyss which lies at the side of the main road
                     over the mountain."</p>
                  <p>"Great God!" cried Louise, with agitation.</p>
                  <p>"Compose yourself; his uncle's domestics arrived in time to save him from that
                     act of despair. The anguish of losing you has caused him a serious illness, for
                     he loves you to distraction. But be not alarmed, Louise, be not alarmed. He is
                     now thoroughly convalescent. Well, do you still consent to be my wife? Have you
                     sufficient courage to forget M. Ernest, whose love for you has led him almost
                     to the gates of death? You do not answer, Louise. You weep' Nothing now remains
                     but for me to do my duty. You would both suffer: it is much more natural that I
                     should suffer alone. Come, Louise, come. It will surely not depend on me to
                     remove all the obstacles which oppose your marriage with M. Ernest. Yet there
                     is one that I can destroy this very hour."</p>
                  <p>Saying this, Joseph Cornu took the hand of the young girl, who had not strength
                     to pronounce a word, and led her towards that part of the meadow where M.
                     Morizot was.</p>
                  <p>"Captain, my conscience bids me release you from a promise made in happier
                     days, Therefore, from this moment Mademoiselle Louise is free to espouse
                     another."</p>
                  <p>And Joseph hastily retired, without awaiting the response of the old soldier,
                     whom this blunt declaration struck with astonishment.</p>
                  <p>M. Morizot had not the severity to reproach his daughter, for the unhappy child
                     looked so pale and dejected that she excited his compassion rather than his
                     anger.</p>
                  <p>The captain abandoned the superintendence of the mowers, to take Louise home to
                     the cottage. Going along he ascertained the motives which had prompted the
                     conduct of Joseph Cornu.</p>
                  <p>"Poor youth!" said me captain; "excellent heart! What a son-in-law have I lost!
                     But God's will be done; let us say no more about it."</p>
                  <p>Towards night, Louise and her father were seated in that same room which we
                     described to our readers. The supper, cooked by old Madeleine, was served up on
                     the table; but M. Morizot and his daughter had not touched it. The one
                     abandoned herself to melancholy reflections, the other, in his own heart,
                     addressed to himself reproaches which silence expressed more eloquently than
                     language.</p>
                  <p>Suddenly many voices were heard, as of persons advancing towards the cottage,
                     and presently the lumber merchant appeared at the garden gate, accompanied by
                     Madame Forestelle and Ernest, who obstinately refused to enter the captain's
                     house.</p>
                  <p>"Come, my dear," said the kind aunt, "our walk has been long, and you must need
                     rest."</p>
                  <p>"Can you comprehend this whim of my nephew?" cried M. Forestelle, who had
                     entered the room. "He refuses to bid you good evening, M. Morizot: you who have
                     visited him five or six times during his sickness. It is an incredible thing,
                     and it must certainly be as they say that his brain has been injured by severe
                     affliction."</p>
                  <p>In the meantime, Ernest, induced by the authority of his aunt, advanced to the
                     threshold of the door. His form bore traces of the terrible malady which had
                     nearly reduced him to the grave. At the sight of these evidences of suffering,
                     Louise could not restrain a heart-rending cry, and ran to embrace the young
                     man. But the captain, rising from his seat, arrested her, and said in an
                     imperious tone,</p>
                  <p>"I command you, Louise, to go to your chamber!"</p>
                  <p>Madame Forestelle heard this positive injunction of the old soldier.</p>
                  <p>"Come, captain," she said, "do not put on such a dignified air Whilst you
                     converse with Ernest and my husband, Louise shall show me the curiosities of
                     your flower-garden. Will you not, my child?" she continued, linking arms with
                     the young girl.</p>
                  <p>Then whispering in the ear of M. Morizot—"Ernest has disclosed, all to me. Be
                     prudent: his uncle knows little or nothing about it yet."</p>
                  <p>With these words she started out with Louise.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile, the invalid, too feeble to bear such lively emotions, drop ped on a
                     bench in a state of exhaustion, which made them fear that he was senseless.</p>
                  <p>"It is nothing," said M. Forestelle. "Listen, captain, I have a, certain vial
                     in my pocket. <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Peste!</foreign> we are obliged to carry
                     about a complete apothecary's shop! There, see how he revives—the salts of that
                     vial would reanimate a corpse. And when I think that it is love that, has
                     reduced him to such a state, I must declare that it is absurd. My wife has
                     whispered me a few words on this subject, and I can tell you in confidence,
                     that he loves some peasant girl of the neighborhood!"</p>
                  <p>"My uncle—oh! for pity's sake, hush!" cried the invalid, clasping, his hands in
                     a supplicating manner.</p>
                  <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7162-00000034"/>
                  <p>"And why should I not relate your follies, my handsome Amadis, my languid Don
                     Quixotte?" replied M. Forestelle, bursting into laughter. I would like to know
                     your Dulcinea! I expect I should see a plump girl, rosy and playful. Really,
                     captain, there are pleasant girls, very pleasant. But then, you know, a young
                     man who has in prospect an inheritance of more than a million, may be permitted
                     to have a love affair, a fancy for a peasantess—but as for marrying her! such a
                     one has not common sense. Stop, I will tell you a tale—oh! <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">dame,</foreign> it is an old historymdash;I Was then in the
                     halcyon days of youth. You know I have been married thirty-seven years! I
                     remember a pretty lass—lovely as possible! She lived in one of the faubourgs of
                     Saint-Die."</p>
                  <p>"Of Saint-Die!" repeated the captain, fixing his flashing eyes on M
                     Forestelle.</p>
                  <p>"Yes. What is their to surprise you in that."</p>
                  <p>"Nothing," said the old soldier; "go on!"</p>
                  <p>Ernest arose from the bench, and his heart beat as though it would burst from
                     his bosom; for he remembered the mournful history which M. Morizot narrated to
                     him six weeks before.</p>
                  <p>"I should then tell you," pursued M. Forestelle:—" ah! first you must know that
                     her name was Clemence——"</p>
                  <p>"At length!" shouted the captain, towering to his full height, in front of the
                     frightened merchant.</p>
                  <p>"What the devil do you mean?" said Ernest's uncle, stepping quickly back from
                     his seat.</p>
                  <p>M. Morizot, almost suffocated with rage, was some time without uttering a word.
                     At last, he cried in a voice of thunder:</p>
                  <p>"And you villain!—you assumed the name of Jules Palaisseau! Know the cause of
                     the discovery! You seduced Clemence, my affianced—you made her a mother, and
                     then abandoned her to her miserable fate. It is nearly nineteen years since she
                     expired in my arms, cursing her infamous seducer with her latest breath. On
                     your knees! on your knees, I tell you! and make your dying prayer to Heaven—for
                     we must fight—do you hear? Arms are at hand, and I have too long cherished my
                     plan of vengeance to let an opportunity sent by God, escape me!"</p>
                  <p>The anger of the captain raged with frightful violence. Mme. For estelle and
                     Louise heard the clamor, and hastened into the house.</p>
                  <p>"I conjure you," said Ernest, rushing towards M. Morizot, Who had seized the
                     terror stricken merchant by the arm, and held it with an iron grasp. "I conjure
                     you to forbear! What a scandalous scene before my aunt and that young girl—And
                     then, you are in your own house captain! The man who is under our roof, claims
                     some regard, though he were our mortal enemy, and, for own sakes, we should
                     respect his person."</p>
                  <p>Yes, you are right, M. Ernest," murmured the old soldier, releasing the arm of
                     M. Forestelle. "And then," he added, while wiping away the hot swout from his
                     brow, "I do not want Louise to know that that wretch is her father!"</p>
                  <p>"Mercy on me! what is going on here?" demanded Ernest's aunt, whilst the young
                     man went to take Louise by the hand, and conduct her before the dismayed
                     merchant.</p>
                  <p>"My uncle" said he, in a respectful but firm voice; "behold the girl I love! A
                     man of honor has it always in his power to repair a fault—and without entering
                     into particulars which you probably divine—without informing you of the precise
                     period of the death of Louise's mother—yes, my uncle, I perceive you understand
                     me, and I throw myself at your knees, supplicating you to permit me to espouse
                     the daughter —— of the captain."</p>
                  <p>M. Forestelle felt an icy chill run through his heart. He turned away his eyes
                     from Louise, on whom he had rested them an instant with indescribable anguish,
                     and looked at the old soldier. The latter then was completely exhausted, and
                     the lumber merchant, who struggled between avarice, and the desire of
                     preventing an exposure of his villany in the presence of his wife, replied to
                     Ernest:</p>
                  <p>"The time for making such a request, is badly chosen—I will see. I will
                     reflect."</p>
                  <p>"For my part, monsieur," replied the young man, "my reflections are all made.
                     If you do not make amends for an odious —— injustice, this very day, I declare
                     that I will withdraw myself from your guardianship, and never again darken your
                     door."</p>
                  <p>Ernest, my dear Ernest!" cried his good aunt, alarmed at such bold language;
                     "your threats will only serve to irritate your uncle.—Eh! but in fact, I
                     approve of it!" she continued, "on reflection, I will not suffer my son to be
                     killed, I have none other! If you refuse to grant his prayer, we will sue for a
                     divorce! You know, monsieur, that we were married under the <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">regime</foreign> of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >communaute;</foreign> consequently I am entitled to half your fortune, and
                     will share it, I swear, with these children."</p>
                  <p>"But this is a plot!" cried the miser: "this is a conspiracy resolve upon
                     beforehand! Who can assure me, after all, that this young girl——No, no! that
                     wont do! you forget, madam, that there must be causes for a divorce. I shall
                     remain the sole master of my fortune, and my dear nephew would do well to
                     espouse her for whom I destine him, or else——</p>
                  <p>The merchant could not finish, for M. Morizot revived from his weakness,
                     marched up to him, animated with the same choler that had already so much
                     terrified Ernest's uncle.</p>
                  <p>"Begone!" he thundered forth, "begone, sirrah! I can no longer restrain
                     myself."</p>
                  <p>The young man, Louise and madame Forestelle, rushed before the old soldier. The
                     lumber merchant, yielding to his terror, made ready to quit the cottage; but he
                     was arrested by Joseph Cornu, who, for<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7162-00000035"/>
                     the last few moments, had witnessed the scene, without any one's observing his
                     presence.</p>
                  <p>"Halt there!" said the secretary of the justice of the peace, unceremoniously
                     taking M. Forestelle by the collar. "I am now, as you may see, a soldier of the
                     army of Africa, and I like not deserters. Look you, what is the matter? If I am
                     not deceived, you refuse to let your nephew marry the captain's daughter, and
                     that, under the frivolous pretext that the poor child has no dowry. Ah, well,
                     undeceive yourself, monsieur of the English machinery. I have been to
                     Saint-Die, where I had a few words to say to a recruiting officer—a worthy
                     officer, my faith, who made me drink champagne in the café at Strasburg. There,
                     I accidentally heard that the famous lottery was drawn to-day at your banker's
                     you know, millionaire of my heart."</p>
                  <p>"In fact," said M. Forestelle, "I ought to have assisted at the drawing, but I
                     thought it more fitting——"</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Ohé!</emph> who wants to know the lucky number?" cried Joseph Cornu on
                     whom the champagne had had a singular effect. <unclear/> Number EIGHTEEN!
                     Mademoiselle Louise has won the chateau! Long live mademoiselle Louise! Long
                     has won the chateau! Long live the soldiers of Africa!"</p>
                  <p>A general cry of astonishment followed this announcement.</p>
                  <p>"I hope," continued Joseph, "that there will be no further obstacle to the
                     marriage. Farewell, captain—farewell, mademoiselle Louise—and do you, monsieur
                     Ernest, make her very happy."</p>
                  <p>With these words, the poor youth burst into tears."</p>
                  <p>"No, my brave Joseph," said M. Morizot, pressing the young man affectionately
                     to his heart; "neither I, nor my daughter will accept such a sacrifice."</p>
                  <p>"Who speaks of sacrifice? There has not been any sacrifice, understand you,
                     captain. The lottery list bore, in full letters, the name of mademoiselle
                     Louise Morizot. The chateau could not be adjudged to any one but her;
                     reclamation would be impossible. Eh! <foreign xml:lang="FRA">par la
                        corbleu!</foreign> I well knew what I could do. Only, M. Ernest, if it is
                     the poor sawyers. That will be a good deed."</p>
                  <p>Lousie extended her hand to Joseph, and said to him, sobbing the while;</p>
                  <p>'Atleast, do not go away—stay with us."</p>
                  <p>"No, Louise—no, my sister—for you are now no more to me than a sister. But
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">dame!</foreign> I must leave this place for a while.
                     I will go to battle—it is as good a means of distraction as any, and I also
                     want to win the cross. Then, Louise, I promise you, I will return. I promise
                     you, captain; and we will talk over our campaigns together. Once more,
                     farewell!"</p>
                  <p>Joseph Cornu left the country, it being impossible to detain him.</p>
                  <p>A month after his departure, the marriage of Louise and Ernest was celebrated

                        Described—The Sensual Element in Love—Love, why the most engrossing of all
                        Passions.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>LOVE sometimes signifies a liking for any thing—more properly, it means any
                     benevolent affection towards our fellow creatures, varying form the most
                     indiscriminate and weak, to the most concentrated and strong; but in a peculiar
                     sense it marks the most ardent and engrossing of all passions, that which
                     exists between the sexes. When taken for any benevolent affection, love
                     certainly constitutes one of the principal elements of human happiness; for
                     there is always a pleasure in loving, as well as in, being loved; and sometimes
                     an intense pleasure. The feeling may be very permanent; and, in some shape or
                     other, it runs throughout all society, Thus it is a source of enjoyment, at
                     once keen, durable, and comprehensive.</p>
                  <p>Love consists of at least two elements: first, a certain pleasure derived from
                     the presence of the beloved object; or simply from reflecting upon it: and
                     secondly, a desire of its good. These elements are essential; for wherever
                     these are, there is love; and wherever these are not, there is none. Another
                     desire is very often connected with the above—always, indeed, when love is
                     limited to certain individuals—and that is<pb n="74-75"
                        xml:id="VAC7162-00000036"/> desire of being loved in return. Whoever loves
                     another, wishes to possess his affections—nay, often to monopolize them. This,
                     as we shall find, makes an essential difference between general and individual
                     ties, not only in the nature of the compound feeling, but also in its,
                     consequences. The desire which forms an element of general benevolence, belongs
                     to the social class; but the desire of securing the affections of others for
                     ourselves, cannot be ranked under the same category. It evidently belongs to
                     the self-regarding class; and by it, therefore, self enters into love, which
                     before was a purely social affection. This is a most important circumstance;
                     for it serves to explain many peculiarities which otherwise could not be
                     accounted for. It explains, for instance, the origin of jealousy, which, like
                     the shadow to the substance, attaches to every modification of individual love,
                     and grows with the form that casts it; for, the greater the love, the darker
                     can be the jealousy, in a mind whose moral organism will allow more than a
                     transient existence to a passion so unholy. Because jealousy is more marked in
                     the case of love between the sexes, it may sometimes have been thought to be
                     confined to it: but this is quite a mistake, since every private attachment is
                     subject to the same unhappy passion. Only, as no love can be compared with that
                     between man and woman, in intensity, so no jealousy can come near that of
                     distrustful lovers.</p>
                  <p>Jealousy, of whatever kind, comprehends two element. 1. A fear of being
                     deprived by another of something which we consider ours by right. 2. A feeling
                     of ill-will towards the person who is the cause of the injury. Thus, fear, and
                     a malevolent desire, are the essential elements of the passion. Now, in every
                     private love, what we fear to lose, is the affection of an individual, which we
                     look upon as our own. From this it is evident, that it is through the
                     self-regarding desire that jealousy enters into love. So long as the social
                     alone prevails, there can be no occasion for jealousy.</p>
                  <p>In every variety of private attachment, we have thus discovered three elements;
                     but love, properly so called, comprehends yet another. To the pleasure derived
                     from beholding, or thinking on the object; to the wish for its good; and to the
                     wish for its affections, must now be added another desire, of a nature so
                     powerful, that the word <emph>desire,</emph> sometimes used to signify this
                     alone. As by the third element, self entered into every particular Love, so by
                     the fourth, sense now enters also. By this last element, sexual love is
                     distinguished from other species or variety.</p>
                  <p>Thus, at last, we have a feeling of a very mixed nature, comprising at least
                     four simple feelings, all different from each other, but still agreeing in
                     this:—that each is full of pleasure. To form this delightful compound, nature
                     has called from various herbs and flowers, their most luscious and intoxicating
                     essences. Emotion and sense, the social and the selfish, the affection and the
                     imagination, the refined and the voluptuous, all unite to compose and season
                     this enchanted mixture. Here all the tenderness of our soul, all our social
                     longings, all our selfish and sensual propensities, are pound in one cup. We
                     quaff the potion, and instantly our desires are concentrated in one subject,
                     for whom alone we think, feel, move and live. <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Quid nisi

                  <p>This is undoubtedly the most violent, and the most engrossing of all the
                     passions; and if unsatisfied, it may be very permanent, ending only with life.
                     Religious enthusiasm seems to come next to it in intensity. Though all the
                     passions may occasionally occupy the whole man, yet these two have a greater
                     tendency to do so, as is proved by their effects; for none else can so upset
                     the mind or body, The difference between them is seen in this:—that unsatisfied
                     love peculiarly affects the<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7162-00000037"/> body,
                     while religious enthusiasm chiefly preys upon the mind. To die of love is by no
                     means an unexampled occurrence; and instances of religious madness are
                     frequent. The sensual desire which forms a part of love, readily explains, the
                     peculiar way in which it acts; for, though people kill themselves for love, or
                     pine away from it till they die, they do not often run mad on that account.
                     Unless we except intense and unexpected joy, no emotion has such an effect on
                     the bodily health, as love. Shakspeare, in a celebrated passage, has
                     beautifully expressed the effects of a hopeless passion. <cit>

                     </q> so completely is the object of his affections metamorphosed by fancy. This
                     delusion is, no doubt, exceedingly blissful while it lasts; and could it be
                     continued, nothing would be wanting to happiness. For love, which, at one time,
                     is the most turbulent of affections, is, at another, the most calming. In the
                     former stage, it is full of the most violent perturbations, of boisterous hopes
                     and fears, succeeding with marvellous rapidity, so as to make the mind one
                     whirlwind: in the latter, where all fear is at an end, it becomes the most full
                     and perfect satisfaction, of which our nature can admit. Love that ends well,
                     is like a mountain way, animating, sublime, but terrific, conducting us through
                     awful chasms, and along the edges of lofty precipices, till last it brings us
                     to a valley, happy as that of Abyssinia.</p>

                  <p>THIS passion has long been a fruitful theme for poets and novelists, who have
                     thrown around it every charm which incident or language could bestow; well
                     knowing that no subject can possibly be found more interesting. Assuredly these
                     writers would not have dwelt so much upon love, had they not been aware that
                     the chord once struck, would meet with a response in every bosom; and that no
                     other music is so truly grateful to the soul. But, however much they may have
                     labored to embellish the strain, they could not surpass that original harmony
                     of which theirs was but a copy. Love has really existed upon earth, fully as
                     intense and profound as ever poets could feign; and living Hamlets and Othellos
                     have trod the stage of the world. These words of Othello, looking towards
                     Desdemona, express no fanciful affection: <q>

                  <p>If there be any thing else an earth capable of giving this inexpressible
                     contentment, it is religion. When in this state, the mind of the lover is so
                     filled with delight, that he feels no wants, nor desires of any kind; and is
                     proof against numberless annoyances which might otherwise destroy his peace. He
                     abandons himself to enjoyment with alloy, and tastes on earth the blessedness
                     of Heaven. To constitute that heaven, duration alone is wanting, at least to
                     our conceptions, for imagination can picture no happiness greater than that of
                     successful Love.</p>
                  <p>2d. Though the passion of love seems always to comprehend the four elements
                     above mentioned,—yet it may present a considerable variety of appearances
                     according to the proportion in which these elements are mixed; and this
                     difference of proportion will sufficiently account for all the modifications it
                     may assume, without supposing any other change in the component parts. Thus, in
                     one man, the sensual desire may be the strongest, in a second, the wish for the
                     affections; while in a third, the social desire may predominate; and whatever
                     be the ruling desire, since it may exceed the others in a greater or less
                     degree, the compound can thus be infinitely diversified. This will account for
                     the doubt which we sometimes hear expressed whether such a person be or be not
                     susceptible of real love for those who have very elevated and refined ideas of
                     the affection, are unwilling to believe that it can ever be felt by the grossly
                     sensual. Nor, can it exactly, in their sense of the word; for what these last
                     experience, though composed of the very same elements, differs so widely to the
                     proportions, that it might almost pass for a separate species; but in truth, it
                     is only a variety. So long as the four elements are found at all, we may say
                     that love exists; but if any be utterly wanting, we must adopt another term.
                     Thus, <emph>lust</emph> is specifically distinguished from love.</p>
                  <p>The most constant variety to be met with, is that between man's and woman's
                     love. We have before remarked that women are more refined than men, and we
                     should therefore suppose that this difference in character would show itself
                     particularly in that passion, so important to the female heart. It has been
                     observed by Madame de Stael, that love, which forms but an episode in the life
                     of man, often occupies great part of woman's. Women are undoubtedly more
                     constant than men, and not only are less given to change the object of their
                     affections, but they can feel warmly for a greater length of time. This, in all
                     probability, depends upon a difference in the nature of their love, and
                     especially upon this, that the sensual desire is comparatively weak in them,
                     while the social is not only relatively but absolutely stronger than in men.
                     Sometimes the wish for the happiness of the object, and sometimes the wish for
                     its affections, may be the predominant feeling; but sense is rarely supreme.
                     And as those refined inclinations are commonly more lasting than the gross, we
                     need not be surprised that the love in which they prevail should better stand
                     the test of time.</p>
                  <p>But whatever may be thought of this explanation, the fact, I conceive, is
                     certain, that female love is peculiarly constant, durable, refined, and
                     self-denying, willing to make the greatest sacrifices for the sake of the
                     happiness of another. It is retiring, tender, benificent, and confiding rather
                     than passionate; though on fit occasions it can display the greatest
                     energy.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>DURING the middle ages in Europe, there grew up a singular passion for the fair
                     sex, half real, half effected. Every chivalrous knight considered it quite as
                     indispensable to have a favored lady in his eye, as to possess a horse and
                     armor; and in want of a real flame, he was bound at least to feign one. There
                     can be no doubt that this practice had an exceedingly civilizing and refining
                     influence, and not only tempered the rude manners of that age, but has left a
                     lasting effect on modern society, where women hold a more important rank, and
                     are treated with more deference and respect, than among the most polished
                     nations of antiquity. Before a knight could pretend to any favors from his fair
                     one, he was obliged to distinguish himself in some bold adventure; and thus his
                     love was stimulated by difficulty, fed by hope, and unsatiated by
                     possession.</p>
                  <p>Under the warm and poetical sky of Italy, this passion for the fair sometimes
                     melted into a fanciful, dreamy, sentimental affection, such as we see depicted
                     by the early poets of that country, particularly Dante and Petrarch. Though
                     Petrarch be most celebrated for this kind of love, yet his was by no means a
                     singular case, for Dante and others partook of the same; and if one had his
                     Laura, the other had his Beatrice. Many laugh at this visionary passion, and
                     even Petrarch was a skeptic in regard to love as an enduring and deep principle
                     of the human soul, until his own experience subdued him effectually<pb
                        n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7162-00000040"/> tually to the faith. But such a
                     feeling, purified from the rapture and vehement desires of a more earthly
                     passion, is possible, though only to natures of singular depth and exaltation.
                     Supposing it to exist, it must be that state of feeling nearest approaching to
                     heavenly joy of which the human soul can conceive. Whoever has known such a
                     state, would exchange it not, for aught else this world can bestow.</p>
                  <p>But over love, as it really exists in a perverted and unthinking world, lies
                     ever the dark shadow of jealousy. We have already explained the nature of this
                     passion, and shown that while in pure benevolence, it can have no place; when
                     self is regarded, it may spring up. Fear, and a malevolent desire are its
                     component parts; and in the case of love, it is the affections and the
                     exclusive possession of the person which we fear to lose; consequently, in a
                     supremely selfish and unchristian heart, the stronger the love. (though to such
                     a one, love in its highest significance is a thing unknown,) the darker will be
                     the jealously; and should we suspect that the very object of our affections may
                     be herself in league against us, a sudden revulsion of feeling will follow,
                     whereby love itself shall change to hate.</p>
                  <p>Though this effect cannot be brought about suddenly, and at once, yet
                     experience too sadly testifies that such a result is not uncommon. Jealousy,
                     however, within certain limits, is often said to faster love, inasmuch as we
                     never value anything so much as when we have actually lost it, or even fear to
                     lose it; so the fear, which is an element of jealousy, causes us to cling to
                     our affection with redoubled ardor. The same principle explains the effects of
                     absence, for absence is both a change and privation. To a certain extent, then,
                     it is probable that jealousy does encourage love; but, when carried far,
                     extinguishes it altogether. Even when jealousy is at an end, and hate becomes
                     the predominant passion, love still enters at times; for an affection once
                     strong, cannot be utterly destroyed, in a moment, even by proofs of
                     unfaithfulness. Long and bitter must be the struggle, before the love that has
                     once folded its wings, and nestled softly in the bosom, can be rejected. The
                     mind, like the physical being, is very liable to a relapse; and thus in the
                     intervals of indignation, love will still recur, as so well depicted in
                     Othello, who, even on the point of executing his deadly purpose, whispers— <q>

                  <p>A writer less acquainted with human nature, might probably have never put such
                     words of tenderness into the mouth of one about to do so evil a deed; but they
                     are perfectly consistent with the former depth and power of the Moor's
                     affection, which came back in all its freshness and intensity, when he had
                     resolved to sever himself at once and for ever from the being who had been
                     dearer to him than life.</p>
                  <p>Original conformation of mind, and particular circumstances, may greatly
                     conduce to the birth and development of jealousy. Some minds are particularly
                     phone to this passion—a bitter ingredient in the cup of life, and fatal to the
                     spirit's peace. Not only is it an ever-cankering thorn in the breast of him who
                     harbors it, which irritates and may destroy the sweet and delicate plant of
                     love, but it often inflicts a wound on the heart of innocence that may be
                     incurable. He who is constantly exposed to unjust suspicion, must at last be
                     alienated from one who is the cause of so much annoyance. No love, however
                     deep, can resist these incessant attacks—as perpetual dropping will come in
                     time to wear the hardest stone. Nay, more: unjust suspicion may chance to lead
                     to that which is well founded. When a man knows that whatever he may do, he
                     cannot escape censure, unless his character be formed on the<pb n="84-85"
                        xml:id="VAC7162-00000041"/> strong basis of Christian principle, he comes by
                     and by, with a reckless hardihood, to think that he may as well give real
                     cause. The frequent irritation caused by the jealous temper of his partner, her
                     want of trust and confidence in him, create a malicious feeling toward her,
                     which prompt him to wound her in the most tender part. Thus it is that unjust
                     jealousy gives rise to real unfaithfulness. No argument against distrust and
                     suspicion, can come home to the heart more powerfully than this.</p>
                  <p>Besides original conformation of mind, peculiar circumstances may account for
                     the entrance of "the green-eyed monster." Such are, a great disparity in age or
                     appearance—the obviously prudential considerations from which one party may
                     have married—or any known deficiency in truth and uprightness of character. The
                     jealousy of Othello is particularly natural, on account of the striking
                     disparity between the young and lovely Desdemona, whose skin was "pure as
                     monumental alabaster," and the swarthy Moor, who was certainly very much her
                     senior.</p>

                     particular will ponder over them who venture to say that Shakspeare was not a
                     moral writer. Full well he knew that the woman who is capable of one act of
                     deception, lays herself open to suspicion in the future. And you, gentle

                  </argument>
                  <p>SINCE love is so sweet and fair a flower, yet frail and delicate withal, liable
                     to be nipped by outward cold, as well as to be consumed by its own inward and
                     excessive heat, we must naturally wish to know how it may be kept alive, and
                     nurtured into strength as well as beauty. The only love which deserves the
                     name, is founded on a spiritual affinity, a oneness of heart and soul, a
                     similarity of tastes, feelings and principles, which begets a sympathy that
                     outward frosts can never chill, and which, in the very nature of things, grows
                     and deepens by time. It looks not for perfection in its object, but remembers
                     that mutual forbearance is the touchstone of domestic happiness. "It is
                     inscribed on both wings of the Angel of the marriage covenant, which he folds
                     in sorrow when the admonition is unheeded." There is a feeling of security
                     which sometimes begets carelessness, and inattention to the various expedients,
                     no less necessary in fostering and perpetuating affection, than in first
                     winning the priceless treasure. <q>

                           <l>"It is better for love to be watchful, and weep,</l>

                           <l>For coldness and death on his slumber steal fast</l>
                           <l>But the love that is <emph>wakeful</emph> lives on to the last."</l>

                  <p>That gentle assiduity and careful consideration of each other's wants and
                     feelings, that characterise lovers before marriage, that anxiety to avoid
                     giving pain, that unfailing politeness of manner—these, which were so easy and
                     natural in the palmy days of courtship, should be scrupulously observed and
                     continued, by those who would prolong the summer days of young love far into
                     the autumn of life.</p>
                  <p>"The love that is wakeful" keeps buoyant and warm, but carelessness affects not
                     only one party, but engenders coldness and despondence in the other. The wife
                     who finds her efforts to please, unappreciated, her endeavors to make home
                     happy met with indifference, becomes at length estranged from her husband.</p>
                  <p>It is evident from the foregoing, as well as known from general observation,
                     that the dangers which love has to encounter are greatest after it reaches the
                     port. The bark which bears it can withstand much better the storms of the open
                     ocean, than the little worm that causes the dry rot; Since desire always looks
                     to the future, it could not possiby exist along with the possession of its
                     object, if this possession were supposed full and complete, for it would be
                     quenched for want of aliment, like fire when there is nothing to burn. But the
                     flame on the altar must be kept bright by gentle words, and kindly deeds, and
                     mutual interchange of sentiment.</p>
                  <p>The durability of the passion will depend, mainly, upon the nature on which it
                     is engrafted, that is, upon the preparation of the different elements of which
                     it is composed. When sense forms the chief part of the compound feeling, love
                     will not long survive possession, because the object, once attained, seems
                     attained completely and for ever. Here, there is no vague idea in prospect,
                     which the imagination can picture as more brilliant than what is already known;
                     what is "of the earth, earthy," cannot be of immortal duration. Only through
                     the loveliness and excellence of the indwelling spirit, does its earthly
                     tenement become sacred and dear. Lastly—beauty, which principally gives rise to
                     sensual love, is not only fleeting, but by custom soon loses its magic. We are
                     often astonished at the insensibility of husbands to the personal charms of
                        their<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7162-00000043"/> own wives. Beauty is much
                     more for the world than for the fireside, and the pursuit of it has been well
                     described as <q>

                  <p>But if love be of a different nature, consisting principally in a desire for
                     the happiness of its object, and a desire for its affection, and if it be
                     founded on mental qualities, more than on mere personal beauty, then it may be
                     very lasting; for the soul once allied to its mate the affections once fixed
                     where they are purely and perfectly reciprocated, can change no more for
                     ever.</p>
                  <p>But whether love be durable or not, it would be an essential error to suppose
                     its influence on our happiness limited to the period of its continuance. That
                     period remains for ever in the memory, as a past but blissful reality, to prove
                     to us of what exalted felicity our nature is susceptible, and favor the belief
                     that what we have enjoyed once, we may enjoy again, if not here, yet hereafter
                     in the land of spiritual blessedness. Strong delights need the less to be
                     repeated, because they live in our remembrance, even until our dying hour. No
                     man who was once in love, can afterwards forget it, and therefore he has within
                     him a fountain of thought and emotion which is never dry. He who has never
                     known love, must have but an imperfect idea of human nature. The greatest of
                     heathen philosophers, is said to have discoursed so eloquently on marriage,
                     that the single all rushed into matrimony; and we may be certain that he did
                     not separate marriage from loye. Those who rail at the emotion would do well to
                     take a hint from Socrates.</p>
                  <p>Love at first sight, though frequently ridiculed, is far from unnatural; nay,
                     it would seem that in most cases, where the feeling is very strong, a decided
                     impression has been produced at the first, which has afterwards been increased
                     by time and intercourse. There appears to be an instinctive sympathy by which
                     congenial minds are drawn together, they scarcely know how. Shakspeare, at all
                     events, believed in love at first sight; Romeo becomes enamored of Juliet the
                     moment he beholds her at a ball. <q>

                  <p>Since love is born and fed by gazing on its object when present, and thinking
                     on it when absent, the obvious cure is, not to gaze and not to think. The first
                     of these is much easier accomplishment than the second; inasmuch as external
                     and bodily actions are more readily controlled, than the workings of that
                     subtler element of the soul. And yet, love must not be supposed to be wholly
                     involuntary; the first emotion undoubtedly is so, but afterwards it may be
                     encouraged or discouraged; guided and regulated, how difficult soever the task
                     may be, by reason and enlightened conscience. We cannot, indeed, directly will
                     away an idea that besets us; nay, the more we desire its absence, the more
                     pertinaciously does it often cling to us; but we can turn our attention to
                     other objects, We can seek amusement, business, travel, something requiring
                     much bodily and mental energy, or, best of all, engage in some scheme of active
                     benevolence, to divert the mind from a placed attachment.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>OF the various promoters of love in its primary and incipient stage, may be
                     mentioned <emph>uncertainty.</emph> This it is which keeps up hope as well as
                     fear—which appear to be elements of love in its first dawning; though as it
                     advances to its meridian, and the mists of morning are dissipated, it groweth
                     brighter and brighter unto perfect love, which casteth out fear. There is a
                     class of lovers with whom the certainty of obtaining the object of their desire
                     quite diminishes its value. It is from a secret instinct of this that women are
                     often led to keep their admirers in suspense for a long time, and are brought
                     with difficulty to an explicit declaration. Poets, from force of imagination,
                     and women, from delicacy of feeling, sometimes penetrate farther into human
                     nature than philosophers. Though they may not be able to state their
                     conclusions in set terms, and reason them out, they are still conscious of
                     them; and they are certainly less liable to gross mistakes than mere
                     mathematical thinkers, who suppose that the mind of man, like an algebraic
                     equation, contains but one or two unknown quantities to be discovered by the
                     intellect alone. Guided by delicacy of feeling, or sometimes by less worthy
                     motives, women keep their lovers in doubt and uncertainty, as if apprehensive
                     that their empire will cease when that thread is severed; comprehending that
                     the time of trial comes when the chase of hopes and fears is at an end—for the
                     little god who was kept awake by the storm, may fall asleep in the calm.</p>
                  <p>Another great promoter of love, is difficulty, which indeed to many minds
                     affords a powerful stimulus in the pursuit of any object, be it amusement,
                     gain, study, ambition, or love. <q>

                  <p>Obstacles tend to increase any passion before as well as after the attainment
                     of its object. In the first case, obstacles tend perpetually to keep that
                     object in our mind; for where there is some impediment to be removed by our own
                     operations, we will constantly be forming schemes or putting them in practice
                     for that purpose. While the mind is forming designs and pursuing them, it must
                     be constantly occupied about the object of these designs; and not only will the
                     intellect be thus engaged, but the emotions will be kept in a constant
                     agitation by a succession of secondary hopes and fears, according as our
                     projects promise well or ill. Now all this activity, both of intellect and
                     feeling, must tend to give permanence as well as strength to the primary
                     passion.</p>
                  <p>When difficulties are thrown in our way designedly by others, then some
                     additional principles are called into action; for our pride receives a wound.
                     Partly from a desire to get rid of this pain of humility, partly from revenge,
                     or a desire of giving pain to those who both oppose our purpose and wound our
                     pride, we pursue our original intent with increased energy. These principles
                     are the source of the marriages from pique, or <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mariages
                        de vengeance,</foreign> which occur now and then in the world, as well as in
                     the realms of fiction. Yet I know not if it be correct to say, that difficulty
                     in these instances increases <emph>love.</emph> Self-will and determination of
                     purpose are strengthened, certainly; but the sequel too often proves, that
                     genuine affection has but little share in <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mariages de
                        vengeance.</foreign>
                  </p>
                  <p>But difficulties not only stimulate desires previous to the<pb n="92-93"
                        xml:id="VAC7162-00000045"/> attainment of their object, but make it more
                     loved and valued when attained. To this tend both reason and feeling, for we
                     are apt to think what has cost us much pain and trouble, must be really
                     precious, as the mother loves with peculiar tenderness the frail and delicate
                     child whose rearing has cost the most of toil and anxiety. If it be true, as is
                     sometimes said, that the happiest marriages are those which have been preceded
                     by long courtships, this may be accounted for partly on the foregoing
                     principle. The time and pains which it has cost us to possess the beleved
                     object, enhance its value in our eyes, and make us cling to it with singular
                     pertinacity. To throw away or neglect, now that we have secured it, is to
                     render vain all our past sacrifices. Another, and doubtless more important
                     cause, is the better acquaintance with each other's character which a long
                     courtship may afford. If affection stand the test of this intimate acquaintance
                     before marriage, it probably will after; and if not, the connection is
                     discontinued, and matrimony relinquished. These causes furnish an argument
                     against too precipitate marriages.</p>
                  <p>The effects of difficulty, however, are two-fold. Until a certain point, it
                     stimulates desire; but beyond that, blunts and destroys it. The particular
                     point at which the reverse effect will begin, must depend on the original force
                     of the desire, and the same obstacle which might deaden a weak impulse, would
                     stimulate a strong one. When difficulty becomes impossibility, the firmest
                     passion will die away; nor can love long exist unreciprocated.</p>
                  <p>Having already alluded to absence as a promoter of love, and having accounted
                     for its effects on the two principles of variety and privation, little remains
                     to be said under that head. Rochefoucauld has said, that absence diminishes
                     moderate and increases strong passions. There is truth in this, but not the
                     exact truth. The fact seems to be, that absence, like difficulty, has a
                     two-fold effect; it first first warms, and afterwards chills passion; but, the
                     period which may elapse before the latter result takes place, will depend on
                     the original intensity of the feeling. In the beginning, absence always acts in
                     the former way, but when prolonged, in the latter. No passion is so weak as not
                     to be enforced transitorily by absence; and none so strong as to resist it when
                     long continued. A life of great variety of study or of engrossing occupation,
                     will of course, sooner banish the absent object from the mind, than one of
                     monotony, idleness, or contemplation; and a deep, retentive, meditative
                     character, will not so soon forget, as the gay and frivolous. There is no more
                     successful nurse of sentiment than meditation. Beneath her quiet watching, it
                     grows ever more real and pervading, until it takes undisturbed possession of
                     the soul.</p>
                  <p>With regard to absence, I differ from many who believe it essential to prevent
                     lovers becoming wearied with each other. It seems to me, that where individuals
                     are spiritually united, they can no more become wearied with each other's
                     society, than with themselves. Change of occupation, diversity of pursuits and
                     subjects of reflection, are necessary and grateful to all; but he who is
                     absolutely known to another, met with entire and unqualified sympathy, can no
                     more wish to avoid the presence which soothes and fills his heart, than the sun
                     can weary of his daily course, and sigh to escape the monotonous round.</p>
                  <p>We come now to speak of the effect of little quarrels and caprices, on love. We
                     speak not of minds of a high order. In strong, well-disciplined characters,
                     grounded in Christian principles, we do not look for petty caprices and
                     childish resentment; but, alas! those are not too common, and few pictures of
                     married life present us with a scene unruffled by <q>

                  <p>It has been said, that these little interruptions of married tranquillity,
                     however unpleasant, give ultimately, additional force to the prevailing
                     passion: that by giving variety and occupation, they break that uniform
                     sweetness which is apt to cloy, and make us more alive to the joys of returning
                     love; that at the same time they oblige us to think much upon the object of our
                     affections, which, constantly suggesting the passion, fixes it more deeply in
                     the soul. Such reasoning is<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7162-00000046"/> erroneous,
                     and could only proceed from one who knew of love through the intellect alone.
                     When the lungs of man shall cloy with the free, pure air of heaven, which God
                     in his unlimited bounty has poured out all round the world—when the fishes of
                     the deep shall cloy with the cool, clear element in which they are
                     enveloped—then shall hearts that love, cloy with goodness, patience,
                     gentleness, and never-wearied sweetness of temper. Love cannot exist without
                     esteem, and esteem could not long survive the friction of idle caprice and
                     jarring discord.</p>

                  <p>BOOKS and music, which tend to soften and refine the hearty, feed and nourish
                     love. Probably nothing promotes it more sweetly than reading together some tale
                     in prose or verse, naturally written, and representing the passion in its most
                     amiable and perfect light. Dante pictures Francesco di Kinnuni and her kinsman
                     as thus engaged when the smouldering fire of love bursts at once into a blaze.
                     In minds peculiarly susceptible to musical impressions, scarcely anything can
                     have a more powerful effect in exciting tender emotions, than music. <q>

                     winning the affection of his pupils.</p>
                  <p>Since the imagination and the affections have a strong mutual influence, poetry
                     and all works of fiction may have a decided effect in kindling the softer
                     flame; for when the imagination is vividly excited, it colors whatever it
                     pervades with its own rainbow radiance.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, gifts may be mentioned as promoting love. In the first place, being
                     associated with the giver, they serve perpetually<pb n="96-97"
                        xml:id="VAC7162-00000047"/> ally to recall him; secondly, they recall him
                     agreeably; thirdly, they are a proof to the receiver of being remembered, and
                     lastly, of being remembered with fondness and partiality. Undoubtedly, the
                     principal charm of gifts consists in their being regarded as love-tokens; so
                     delightful is it to feel that we are indeed preferred by another. The heart of
                     man yearns after affection as its natural aliment, and eagerly notes, and
                     warmly cherishes, any indication of it, in look, gesture, word, or deed. Let us
                     not, then, undervalue gifts, which in themselves seem but trifling, for nothing
                     is really trifling that serves to conciliate love, or bring back again the past
                     gladness of its early budding, in the days of young romance. Nay, small favors
                     are decidedly to be preferred to great. In every species of affection, those
                     acts please the most which prove that we are beloved—not their intrinsic worth,
                     not their splendor or beauty, renders gifts dear, but the spirit which prompted
                     their bestowal—a wild flower gathered with difficulty and danger from the brow
                     of a precipice, would give more pleasure to the receiver than the most costly
                     trinket.</p>
                  <p>But love, beautiful and excellent as it should be, is the source of infinite
                     misery to mankind, and in minds unbalanced by strong moral and intellectual
                     developments, leads, albeit through a pathway strewn at first with flowers,
                     adown the thorny vale of vice. Thus, is it in truth, with all our desires when
                     left to wander blindfolded where they list. All only lead to harm, nay, even to
                     our destruction; but since without them man would be an inert, a joyless, and a
                     useless being, and since to destroy them is impossible, even were it desirable,
                     it only remains to us to guide and regulate them by reason and conscience—those
                     divine lights bestowed on man, beneath whose benignant rays his whole being
                     should be brought into order of harmony and beauty.</p>
                  <p>The more we refine love, and separate it from sense, the more do we lesson its
                     evil effects, and secure the good. Most of the misery connected with love,
                     whether to individuals or nations, arises from the predominance of sense; or
                     this it is, which leads to vicious connections, to precipitate marriages, to
                     the wo of families and the decline of States. It is lust, not love, which is
                     the real source of evil; genuine love recognises no sensual pleasure in which
                     the soul does not blend. The only efficient restraint to this unhappy tendency,
                     must be supplied by reason and by education; intellectual and
                        <emph>moral</emph> education, which refines the mind, gives a taste for more
                     elevated enjoyments, and teaches calm, habitual, self-control. Thus, and thus
                     only, shall we find the happiness, without the misery, of love.</p>
                  <p>The sorrow arising from imprudent, ill-assorted marriages is so well known, so
                     palpable, and has been so often dwelt on by different writers, that it needs no
                     argument here to prove their folly. Marriages which are the result of a sudden
                     impetuous passion, kindled by personal beauty alone, can scarcely fail of
                     bringing unhappiness in their train; beauty is the frailest of all foundations
                     for a lasting connection; unless, indeed, it be that beauty of expression,
                     which may shed its sunshine over the plainest features, revealing the treasure
                     of goodness, intelligence and love within. This is a beauty which is
                        <emph>not</emph> frail—which does not pall, or fade when time has stolen the
                     freshness of youth.</p>
                  <p>But marriages sanctioned and hallowed even by the spirit of love, are not
                     always accordant with prudence. They may be entered upon too early, before
                     either mind or body are matured, or fitly prepared to meet the duties of that
                     sacred relation. Nor, is it only unwise, but morally wrong, to assume the
                     responsibility of supporting a dependant family before some provision of
                     worldly substance is secured.</p>
                  <p>We sometimes see persons who marry from a violent and thoughtless impulse, come
                     in time to regard each other with indifference, or even aversion. They are
                     indeed more prone to this sad extreme than others who came to the altar without
                     one spark of affection to cement their union. On the one hand, love had
                     prodigiously exaggerated the merits of the parties, and concealed, or
                     diminished every fault and imperfection; while the passion being founded on
                     mere personal attractions, unsupported by reason and sober sense must
                     inevitably decline when the charm of novelty is gone. The eyes are opened as
                     from a dream, the landscape which looked so beautiful in the<pb n="98-99"
                        xml:id="VAC7162-00000048"/> distance, on a nearer approach becomes cold and
                     barren—views of character never before suspected to exist are revealed, and the
                     anguish of disappointment is succeeded by settled aversion.</p>
                  <p>Those, on the other hand, who marry without loving, have woven no golden
                     visions of a blissful future, and therefore cannot be disappointed, and in the
                     course of time, particularly if the parties be not naturally unamiable, there
                     sometimes grows up a certain want of each other, the <emph>necessitude</emph>
                     of the Latins, a sort of mutual regard, the effect of the natural cleaving of
                     the heart to <emph>something</emph>—far indeed from love, but yet the shadow of
                     affection.</p>
                  <p>That this kindly state of feeling should ever arise between those who began
                     married life in transports, and continued it in hate, can scarcely be expected.
                     The experience of riper years <emph>may,</emph> however, bring with it juster
                     and more rational views; may teach the philosophy of a cheerful resignation to
                     what cannot be averted; and out of long intercourse there may spring up a
                     secondary affection, like the ghost of a friend departed.</p>
                  <p>But to marry on the faint prospect that at some remote period affection may be
                     called forth, is to incur a present and certain evil, (in comparison with which
                     all other earthly evils are as nothing), for the sake of a distant and most
                     uncertain good. If purely passionate marriages be reprehensible, what can be
                     said of marriages of pure convenience? They may carry an air of wisdom about
                     them; to the unsentimental and the worldling they may seem prudent, discreet,
                     judicious; but alas, it is folly clothed in a borrowed garment. What were a
                     life of toil, hardship, unremitted care, in comparison with being unequally
                     yoked, for a life-long pilgrimage; but at home and in society, at table, by the
                     fireside, morning and evening, an unalleviated and irremediable calamity? And
                     yet, how does experience contradict reason, how do men and women go on
                     submitting to be chained with golden fetters, sacrificing the holiest
                     affections of the heart on the altar of ambition or fashion, or worldly
                     gain.</p>

                     the era of emancipation. The young are usually fond of change, and to
                     superficial natures, who have no intense and deep sympathies which crave a
                     response, conventional marriages may be no disadvantage. Time will bring with
                     it duties, cares and responsibilities which give an interest in life, afford
                     scope for mental and bodily activity, and thus supply a kind of happiness, the
                     highest, perhaps, of which they are capable.</p>
                  <p>But in unions of this character, that delightful and fairy period of life is
                     lost. The romantic hopes, the novelty and poetry, of this bright scene of
                     existence, is all a blank to the pair who make marriage a mere business
                     arrangement. They are strangers to the inspirations which make beings, at other
                     times dull and inanimate, seem to renew their existence and soar upon
                     spirit-wings to the realms of ideal bliss; which give new brilliancy to the
                     eye, a warmer eloquence to speech, a more, acute susceptibility to enjoyment,
                     and a more enlivening, hopeful view of the world and of mankind. Assuredly, the
                     most perfect idea of happy love, is that of a courtship varied by difficulty,
                     yet animated by hope, prompting to exertion, yet always sweetening toil,
                     pending on luxuries to come, but wisely forbearing to pluck the fruit before it
                     be fully ripe; who would<pb n="100" xml:id="VAC7162-00000049"/> compare this
                     with the mercenary bargain, where liberty is sold for pelf, or the appetite
                     which destroys itself by a premature voracity.</p>
                  <p>Among the Scottish peasantry are frequent instances of devoted attachment
                     continued for years, till prudence allow a consummation of long cherished
                     hopes; and certainly, no stronger evidence of the purity and virtue of that
                     warm-hearted people could be adduced.</p>
                  <p>But the last and most important objection to marriages without affection,
                     remains to be mentioned. It is the broad and fearful pathway of immorality
                     which they throw open. Since few persons pass through life without experiencing
                     love, if the passion does not find repose and reciprocity within the pale of
                     matrimony, there is a strong probability it will without. Marriage without
                     affection cannot fill the heart, nor prevent it from going forth to meet
                     elsewhere the sympathy it demands. Consequently, if the sense of duty and moral
                     obligation be weak, there is no safeguard against infidelity, and at best
                     nothing but a forced constancy to be expected.</p>
                  <p>In a state of society where such marriages are common, a grievous laxity of
                     morals must prevail, a laxity which is both a cause and effect of such
                     connexions.</p>
                  <p>Did not experience teach us to the contrary, reason would assure us that the
                     number of wrecks which lie strewn along this fearful shore, would prove a
                     sufficient warning to younger voyagers on the sea of life, to shun the breakers
                     which so many have rashly dared before. But no; when the sails are filled with
                     the breeze of love, if conscience, serene and true, sit not at the helm, and if
                     reason, strong and clear, supply not the barque with ballast, it is no wonder
                     she is dashed upon the rocks. It is not that there is any want of love in the
                     world, every day shows that of all passions it is the most active, the most
                     wakeful, and the most tenacious.</p>
