               <p>THERE was an old tavern haunt in the upper part of the city of New York, in the
                  year 1776, at and round which was wont to swarm, in that time of excitement and
                  prognostic trouble, quite a variety of loose and lounging characters. The place
                  had been not inappropriately dubbed "THE POOR MAN'S INN," from the fact that none
                  but those who were indisputably poor in every conceivable particular were ever
                  seen about its precincts. Such, at least, was the title by which it was best known
                  by the citizens and neighboring inhabitants. With its regular occupants it
                  invariably went by the name of "THE EEL POT;" but whether from any supposed
                  similarity it bore to such an alluring invention or not, it lies entirely without
                  our power to say.</p>
               <p>The house itself looked ruinous and rotten enoughâ€”its door-sills being on a fast
                  road to decay, and the street itself rapidly filling up to a point considerably
                  above them. Yet there was an air of antiquity about its old, fantastically-formed
                  roof, looking half as if it had once had a mind to give itself up altogether to
                  gables, and half as if it meant to abjure them altogether, that readily arrested
                  the stroller's eye, and naturally enticed his thoughts into quaint fancies and
                  sombre reflections. The shingles upon the sides of the house, or, at least, upon
                  its front, were thickly covered with green and gray mosses, that gathered
                  themselves here and there into regular-looking embossments, and gave the old
                  building the appearance of being coated and screened with some firmly-rivetted
                  armor. Just over the eaves peered long and slim weeds, that had thought to glory
                  over others in their water trough heights, while after all they looked as if their
                  only lease on life was held upon condition that they should be allowed to come
                  down.</p>
               <p>The chimney was a huge one, built of stone, and occupying a liberal share of the
                  building itself, as was the custom in those times. The panes in the windows were
                  exceedingly small, scarcely allowing a man to exhibit the whole outline of his
                  face and features. About the outside of the windows was built the customary
                  frame-work, nailed flat and fast to the side of the house, and uniting above the
                  same in the same angle that was given to the two sides of the roof at the
                  ridge-pole.</p>
               <p>It was a mellow, genial day in the month of May, in the eventful year 1776. The
                  people of New York were all excited, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">pro</foreign> and
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">con.,</foreign> to the highest pitch over the
                  discussion of the revolutionary steps that had already been taken by the Americans
                  against the tyranny of the mother country. The majority, as a matter to be
                  expected, were united in upholding the brave and defiant conduct of the hasty and
                  raw levies, who had only the summer before withstood so courageously the flower of
                  England's army on the heights of Banker's Hill; yet there were thoseâ€”and they were
                  not few, eitherâ€”who openly scouted the idea of our making a successful resistance
                  to the forces of the crown, and characterized in no very measured or meaningless
                  terms, either, the infatuation of those men, who thought to secure for their
                  future claims and requests even that attention and respect from the ministry which
                  they had heretofore received.</p>
               <p>The bar-room of the "Eel Pot" was partly full, on the morning of the day of which
                  we speak, and the singular and perilous situation of the colonies formed the chief
                  staple of the not over-intelligent conversation that might have been overheard. It
                  was plain that the "Eel Pot" was a place where as yet every man was allowed the
                  freest and least inhibited expressions of his sentiments, both political and
                  moral. There was a gathering there of all sorts and almost all sizes of people.
                  Some stood before the bar, their glasses in hand, uttering fugitive bits of
                  opinions at one another, and swallowing occasional gulps of the spirits that so
                  cheered their own. Others knotted themselves about the entrance, gazing first upon
                  the spit-stained floor, and then into each others' faces and then they mumbled out
                  some expressions relative to the subject in hand, that certainly betokened not
                  altogether their heartiest concurrence in what might then be termed popular
                  sentiment.</p>
               <p>Presently the groups began to resolve themselves into their constituent elements,
                  when they observed the entrance of an oddly-dressed individual into the room, and
                  to re-gather in one general knot about him as he stood conversing with mine worthy
                  host, Paul Potter.</p>
               <p>"Hand me out some of your old Holland, Paul," said the stranger, with an air of
                  familiarity.</p>
               <p>"Is that you, John Horton?" exclaimed one of the company, stepping up to him and
                  laying a no very delicate hand upon his broad shoulders.</p>
               <p>"Yes, this is old Verd-Antique," replied the stranger, looking round and
                  recognizing an old acquaintance in the person addressing him.</p>
               <pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6939-00000003"/>
               <p>"But where from, John?" pursued his interrogator, clutching his bony hand.</p>
               <p>"That I never tell," replied he, mysteriously, while he gave his huge shoulders a
                  peculiarly expressive shrug. "But you are goin' to have some o' this good old
                  Holland with me, now? Come!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I never refuse an old friend <emph>that</emph> much of a favor, Johnâ€”if it
                  is one; and I hope I'll never see the time when you'll refuse me, either."</p>
               <p>"No, no; never may that time come; never, I hope. But what is the news here with
                  you now?"</p>
               <p>"News! Aint there news enough <emph>everywhere?</emph> I hope you don't want no
                     <emph>more</emph> news, John Horton! I <emph>hope</emph> you don't! Haven't the
                  British made us work enough already to do? And aint there been men enough killed
                  a'ready, to make news enough to last for a good many year? Tell me, John? Tell me
                  that!"</p>
               <p>"Maybe there'll be <emph>more</emph> killed, before there'll be any
                     <emph>less,</emph>" laconically replied Verd Antique.</p>
               <p>"Yes, an' you'll help do it, too; won't ye?"</p>
               <p>"I'll be deathly sartin not to kill none o' my own friends, and the friends of my
                  own country," replied he, glancing round to catch the sentiment of approval or
                  disapproval, as it should express itself upon the countenances of those about
                  him.</p>
               <p>"You're really in with the rest on 'em, then; aint ye?" inquired his acquaintance,
                  taking the glass of spirits and water in his hand, and preparing to entomb it
                  within his own skeleton-looking carcass.</p>
               <p>"With the rest o' <emph>who?</emph>" asked Verd-Antique, clapping his glass to his
                  lips immediately upon the question, and pouring a steady stream thenceforward down
                  his apparently parched throat.</p>
               <p>"O, the rebelsâ€”I mean theâ€”â€”"</p>
               <p>"<emph>The rebels!</emph>" repeated John Horton after him in the most contemptuous
                  manner, grinding his teeth together till their gritting sound could be distinctly
                  heard, and striking his tumbler down upon the rude bar with an unwonted and unsafe
                  force. "The rebels!"</p>
               <p>"No offence, John; no offence!" instantly apologized his companion, observing the
                  indignation he had so unexpectedly aroused in John Hortons' bosomâ€”"I really didn't
                  know that you belonged to 'em, John."</p>
               <p>"Wal, no more do I," replied he. "But I cal'late to be round where there's
                  fightin' and warrin' a-goin' on; and if I can be of any use to my own country,
                  why, then I <emph>cal'late</emph> to beâ€”that's all. I mean to go on my own hook. I
                  don't obey <emph>no</emph> man's orders, because I don't willingly put myself
                     <emph>under</emph> no man. If I fight, I fight on my own account; and, mind ye,
                  I don't make no half-way work about it, neither! Jest <emph>remember</emph> that,
                  will ye? Hey?"</p>
               <p>As he spoke these words, he took the landlord aside to the farther corner of the
                  room, and began talking with him in a low strain, which was steadily kept up by
                  him for several minutes. No one else knew of what he was talking; but every one
                  knew that it was of no common importance from the very emphatic and gesticulatory
                  manner in which he laid down all his positions to his attentive friend, Paul
                  Potter While he was talking in this manner, we said the crowd watched him with
                  interest. The reader may be supposed to be taking a close survey of him, too.</p>
               <p>He was a man of apparently forty years; of a stout, athletic frame; a-tall,
                  well-made figure; with a head that sat erect and firm upon his shoulders; an eye
                  of blueâ€”dark, deep and expressive; shaggy eyebrows; a bronzed skin, undoubtedly
                  become so by long and ruthless exposure; a nose somewhat long, and slightly
                  aquiline; a well cut, firm-featured mouth; rather high cheek-bones; and a round,
                  oval chin. His beard at this particular time was long and grizzly, neither very
                  light nor very dark, yet what might be called a dark brown; and his locks stuck
                  out liberally and flowing from beneath the slouched hat that strove to conceal
                  them.</p>
               <p>He wore a grizzly-gray loose coat about his body that descended not quite to his
                  knees. There was nothing beneath this but a coarse shirt, whose seam gaped
                  frightfully at the breast, exposing a brawny chest such as Goliath himself it may
                  be supposed would have contemplated with delight. His pantaloons, which were of
                  buckskin, were laced tightly about his ankles, over which were drawn a pair of
                  cowhide boots that seemed to want for everything but actual service. These
                  pantsâ€”or, more properly, breechesâ€”were hitched up over his hips with a narrow
                  strip of leather. About his neck he wore something that might once have stood for
                  a neckcloth; but it would be impossible then to have told with the least degree of
                  accuracy what it was. It constituted the only article, either of adornment or of
                  comfort, with which his neck was supplied at all. With his hands stuck carelessly
                  within the pockets of his coarse coat, in the peculiarly independent attitude he
                  very often assumed, he was a subject worthy of an artist's pencil.</p>
               <p>Why he had applied to himself the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">soubriquet,</foreign>
                  VERD-ANTIQUE, surpasses our knowledge; as it doubtless did that of everybody else
                  about him. He was quite as much known by that, however, among his friends and
                  acquaintances, as by any other title. It was, in all probability, one he had
                  usurped himself, never deigning to give the inquisitive world the benefit of an
                  innocent why or wherefore.</p>
               <p>He was, in every respect, a <emph>character.</emph> And as he stalked out at the
                  door, the many eyes that inquiringly followed him bore abundant testimony to the
                  fact. He formed a studyâ€”and a deep study, tooâ€”for the whole of them He was a
                  subject that even the most sagacious of them had not yet been able to expound or
                  fathom. And when Paul Potter, the landlord, walked back again behind his bar, and
                  Verd Antique went sullenly out the door, the former seemed to them all to shake
                  his head bodingly in spite of himself; after which he took down a case bottle and
                  poured out for his own stomach a potion of old Jamaica far beyond his usual point
                  of indulgence. This he drank down at almost a single draught.</p>
               <p>The bystanders only looked inquisitively at each other, but no words escaped
                  them.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <head type="sub">REBEL AND TORY.</head>
               <p>THERE lived in the lower part of the city a gentleman tobacconist, named Elton
                  Edwards. Mr. Edwards was already a retired merchant, enjoying himself in the bosom
                  of his family with the abundant assistance of his large gains in trade.</p>
               <p>His only family consisted of himself, his daughter Laura, and a servant girl named
                  Susan. He was himself a man of a trifle over fifty years, of true British birth,
                  and had been a widower for many yearsâ€”not to exceed fifteen, however. He had
                  settled himself in business in New York some twelve or fourteen years before the
                  commencement of our story, having been originally driven to seek a change for
                  himself and his only child by the anguish occasioned by the lamentable death of
                  his wife. Embarking at once, and under favorable auspices, in the line of business
                  we have mentioned, he soon began to accumulate large gains, and by assiduous
                  industry and perseverance at length became a highly wealthy and respectable
                  citizen. His loyalty to the king, however, was unbounded. No sunshine of fortune
                  among the colonies could entice him from that allegiance to the crown which he
                  deemed his chief lease upon life and all the enjoyments it so abundantly offered
                  him. Mr. Edwards, in truth, was a tory, and one in whose veins flowed the warmest
                  tory blood.</p>
               <p>The exact number of pounds that rightfully belonged to him, it is impossible to
                  state; but those who were supposed to be best acquainted with his affairs, and his
                  somewhat peculiar method of doing business, generally set him down for a quite
                  wealthy individual. He lived in a samewhat antiquated house, yet it was furnished
                  in a style every way becoming the fortune he enjoyed. He made no great appearance
                  in the world, neither did he pretend to. He only meant to go along and enjoy his
                  money, unmolested by any one. It was only upon the subject of politics that he
                  ever engaged himself in public conversation, and even then but rarely; but he
                  always expressed his political sentiments and preferences in so decided and
                  unmistakeable a way, that no one needed to have asked him to speak upon them a
                  second time.</p>
               <p>Laura Edwards was a girl of about eighteen years, and an only child. She was born
                  in England, it is true; but for all that, she was none the more of a loyalist on
                  that single account.</p>
               <p>Her education, for those times, was in every respect a superior one, it having
                  been the wish of her father to qualify her to move in the best society the
                  colonies might any of them afford. Of course, then, in no one particular had her
                  training been neglected or lightly passed over.</p>
               <p>In person, she was tall and remarkably well formed. Her face was full and inclined
                  to floridity. Her features were all finely marked; not as if chiselled by a
                  sculptor's instrument, but as if they were rather mouldedâ€”and moulded most
                  perfectly, too.</p>
               <p>Her head was most classically shaped, and sat up on her white and arching neck,
                  like the head of a swan. Her hair was jetty blackâ€”black as the inside of a glossy
                  raven's wing. Eyes of a very dark blue, that one would scarcely distinguish from a
                  downright black itself, beamed pleasantly and full of gleaming expression from
                  underneath her pure while forehead, while from their lids grew long and silken
                  lashes that swept far below them. Her cheeks were somewhat full, and the clear
                  red-and-white colors lay in them, even as rosy clouds are sometimes dreamily
                  entangled and intertwisted in the depth of a summer sky. Her mouth was small, but
                  well-shaped; at each corner of whose pouting lips swam two roguish and
                  indescribable dimples, to but look at which were allurement enough for the most
                  strait-laced moralist.</p>
               <p>She was the life of her father's houseâ€”ever gay and noisy; yet she was anything
                  and everything but boisterous. She was in her manners as unexceptionable as any
                  lady of her day.</p>
               <p>There was a little chamber in her father's house which had long been devoted to
                  her own use. Scarcely ever did even her own father enter it, so complete was the
                  understanding that it was all her ownâ€”that its precincts were specially sacred to
                  her. In this room she had accumulated a few books, which she had arranged against
                  the oaken wainscotting, after the manner of a library; while upon a table that
                  stood drawn out into nearly the centre of the apartment, was confusedly thrown and
                  piled up a large variety of work, consisting indiscriminately of plain sewing,
                  embroidery, and the like, of which no one may be supposed to have half as accurate
                  a knowledge as a woman herself.</p>
               <p>Laura was sitting in this room of here, one afternoon in May, alone. It was the
                  day subsequent to that when we opened our first chapter. Her father had gone from
                  home, and Laura had sent away the servant Susan upon some frivolous pretext or
                  other, that she might he undisturbed. It was evident from all this, as well as
                  from the frequent and anxious glances she cast upon the door and out of the
                  window, that she was momentarily expecting the entrance of some one, whom she
                  seemed to desire to appear at once, as being the time most favorable.</p>
               <p>She had not long to sit, however, in this to her agony of suspense, for she soon
                  heard the echo of a light and studiously disguised foot-fall in the hall, and in
                  another second there came a light tapping of the knuckles upon her door.</p>
               <p>"Come in!" at once commanded she, her voice crowding itself up to as high a pitch
                  of courage and tone as was possible, although it quavered in her throat a
                  trifle.</p>
               <p>Instantly the door opened, and a young man entered. Hastily drawing up his chair
                  by the side of Laura, he took her hand within both his own, and imprinted upon its
                  back a fervent kiss. Then he continued holding it, while she went on to express to
                  him her anxiety lest he would not come at all, and her strange fears at the
                  clouded prospect of public affairs. That was a time in the history of our country,
                  when the state of public matters bore a more intimate relation<pb n="6-7"
                     xml:id="VAC6939-00000004"/> tion to private enjoyment than we may now know
                  anything of. There was nothing absolutely settled, <emph>then.</emph> The elements
                  had been all set at work, boiling and seething since blood was spilt at Lexington,
                  and at Bunker's Hill. People were sure of nothingâ€”not even of their meanest
                  possessions. A hostile fleet was hovering upon our coast; but where, or in what
                  particular direction bound, surpassed the ingenuity of men to imagine.</p>
               <p>The young manâ€”to whom it becomes us without farther delay or ceremony to introduce
                  the readerâ€”was of perhaps twenty-three years of age, tall, well-built, and of a
                  manly carriage. His eyes were a dark gray, and the forehead above them was ample
                  and intellectual. His features were all strikingly good and strongly marked. He
                  wore short and dark whiskers on each side of his face, that became him
                  exceedingly. He had a profusion of hair, which was of the blackest kind, glossy,
                  and inclined to curling.</p>
               <p>You could not have looked steadily for a moment into his eyes, without being
                  touched contagiously with their peculiar expression. They were large and inclined
                  to fulness; and when they wore a particularly pleasant look, it was next to
                  impossible to harbor gloomy or morose thoughts beneath their genial sunshine.
                  Again, if they attempted to express a feeling of fierceness, or displeasure, there
                  were few who knew him, that did not secretly admit that the look came from the
                  depths of a stirred and indignant soul.</p>
               <p>He was dressed plainly and with studied care; betraying that he had but little of
                  this world's goods to waste upon objects that were, after all, of comparative
                  frivolity. He wore a loose frock-coat, a pair of plain and pretty smoothly-worn
                  kerseymere pantaloons, shoes that were no intimate acquaintances with blacking of
                  any quality or description, and a pair of blue stockings that nothing could have
                  concealed. The cuffs of his coat-sleeves were abundantly long, and the cut of his
                  vestâ€”or coat, eitherâ€”was by no means of the freshest or most fashionable
                  importation. Yet although in these particulars he approached so dangerously near
                  to the externals of a ploughboy, or a rough backwoodsman, there was something in
                  his face that belied any suspicions of rudeness or want of culture. But the
                  culture was all <emph>within.</emph> It was upon himselfâ€”upon his heartâ€”upon his
                  very soul.</p>
               <p>"I may not soon see you again, Laura," said he pressing her fair and delicate hand
                  with fervency and illy concealing the emotion that found its way out with his
                  words.</p>
               <p>"Why not, Henry? Where are you going?" inquired she, gazing up into his face with
                  deep anxiety.</p>
               <p>"You know that my country needs me now," he replied.</p>
               <p>"Are you goingâ€”â€”?"</p>
               <p>"I am going to enlist," interrupted he.</p>
               <p>There was a pause of a minute or two.</p>
               <p>At length he spoke himself.</p>
               <p>"I resolved, however, to come and tell you all first, Laura. I know that you
                  cannot, or your father cannot regard me with any degree of favor, because I am a
                     <emph>rebel</emph> in his eyes. I deserve to be hung; and Iâ€”â€”."</p>
               <p>"Do not talk thus, Henry!" implored she. "You know how my feelings are in relation
                  to this contest, and you can need no assurance from me that they will never be
                  changed, so long as the inhabitants of the colonies conduct themselves in the
                  honorable manner they heretofore have. What my father thinks is nothing to me, at
                  this time. I think for myself in this matter, and yet I love him none the less as
                  my father. That need make no difference, Henry. If you enlist, you are no rebel in
                     <emph>my</emph> eyes. You are a PATRIOT, and you deserve the name!"</p>
               <p>He raised her hand to his lips.</p>
               <p>"Yet if this cup could but pass my lips, Henry," she continued, seeing the
                  conflicting emotions that disturbed his breast.</p>
               <p>"It is a sore trial, Laura," he exclaimed, in a low and deep tone. "But men must
                  come from <emph>somewhere.</emph> There are few enough now, heaven knows, to save
                  even a strong cause. We need all that can be raised. The enemy at this moment
                  threaten us on every side. There is no knowing in what quarter their next approach
                  will be. And therefore the country stands in greater need of more men. They are
                  needed at every turn. Fortifications are wanted everywhere; and men are needed to
                  defend them. If all staid at home, where should we all be eventually?"</p>
               <p>"Spoken just like a brave man and a patriot, as you are!" replied Laura. "Henry
                  Byram, go to the defence of your country! Much as my heart is bound up in your
                  ownâ€”closely as my heart-strings are intertwined with yoursâ€”I cannot hesitate to
                  say to you in this emergencyâ€”go! Go, by all means, Henry! Win a proud name for
                  yourself that shall make you worthy the respect of those who would now affect to
                  spurn you!"</p>
               <p>"I will, Laura! I will!"</p>
               <p>"Go, and my blessing be on your head! Heaven will take abundant care of you:
                  heaven takes care of me, and will continue to do so for your sake. I know that the
                  parting is hard, Henry. I know that we are all uncertain when we may meet again,
                  or whether we shall at all in this world; yet my duty commands me to give you
                  entirely up at this time. It would be selfish in me to attempt to thwart even the
                  most trifling interests of our country!"</p>
               <p>"God ever bless you, my sweet girl!" exclaimed Henry, rising from his seat and
                  throwing his arms tenderly about her. "Will you pray daily for my safety?"</p>
               <p>"Each night and morning I will offer up a fervent prayer for you," said she, the
                  big tears filling her eyes, and her pretty lip quivering faintly.</p>
               <p>"Then I am content. But for this, I could not have put my knapsack over my
                  shoulders. It is all well now, however. My heart feels stronger than it did. I can
                  go anywhere now, if I am but commanded."</p>
               <p>"We shall meet each other soon again, under better auspices, I hope," said
                  she.</p>
               <p>"God grant it may be!" replied the young man, still standing over her. "The war
                  may be a long and troublesome one; but, under Providence, it will all yet be well.
                  I feel that it will. We are engaged in a righteous cause, and it cannot be
                  vanquished by any enemies, though their hosts swarm never so thickly about
                  it."</p>
               <p>A brief pause ensued, during which both the young man and his betrothed looked
                  steadily down upon the floor. Their thoughts were upon the dark and untried
                  future.</p>
               <p>"You are alone, I hope?" asked Henry.</p>
               <p>"Yes; I made the appointment, knowing that the house would be vacant at this
                  time."</p>
               <p>"And there can be no danger of my detection from your father, as I go down
                  stairs?"</p>
               <p>"No; yet you had better take your way out by the side entrance. He would not be as
                  likely to meet you there."</p>
               <p>"I should not care to have him come in contact with me yet," said he. "I wish
                  first to satisfy him that I am no <emph>rebel,</emph> but an honest-hearted man.
                  It will take time to satisfy him of that, however."</p>
               <p>"Yes, all that must be the work of time alone."</p>
               <p>"Let us hope to meet under more agreeable circumstances at some future day,
                  Laura," said he. "I hope we may yet be permitted to receive the blessing of your
                  father. It would be the happiest day of my life"</p>
               <p>"Yet we must not expect to turn him from his set prejudices with mere trifles.
                  Providence, in his regular way, will probably satisfy him of his error. But I hear
                  footsteps!"</p>
               <p>They hurriedly embraced each other a moment and the young girl was alone.</p>
               <p>In another moment, Susan, the servant, stood knocking at the door of her mistress,
                  demanding admission.</p>

               <p>AN officerâ€”an Americanâ€”was sitting alone in his room in the city, one night in the
                  latter part of May, engaged to all intents in deep study. He repeatedly ran his
                  eagle eye over a few roughly drawn maps that lay on the table before him, and
                  studied them in every part with great eagerness. He traced out line upon line with
                  his broad index finger, and, when it had arrived at a given point, he supported
                  his head with his hand again, and fell into a deeper fit of thought than ever.</p>
               <p>The apartment which he occupied was not the most elegantly furnished, yet there
                  was everything in it that could have been needed by such an occupant. A broad,
                  plain centre-table stood in the middle of the room, upon which lay the maps and
                  charts to which we have made allusion. On one side of the individual was piled up
                  a liberal heap of letters and despatches. Ever and anon, too, as his eye tired
                  with running over the outlines marked on the charts, he had recourse to the
                  letters, several of which he took down from their pile, opened, and carefully
                  perused. Then he fell to musing again.</p>
               <p>Let us describe the man to the reader.</p>
               <p>He sat in a large arm-chair, made wholly of wood. His head was large and
                  well-shaped, indicating a mind well-balanced, and the possession of a strong and
                  decisive will. His forehead, though not remarkably high, was broad and ample; and
                  his long, dark hair fell in half-wavy, half-curling locks down either side his
                  head. His eyes were large and alive with expression, and shadowed above with
                  rather heavy brows. His face was full and fleshy. The mouth was the picture of
                  firmness and decisiveness itself; yet there lurked about its corners just wrinkles
                  enough to betray the genial humor and the warmth of heart that tempered all. His
                  chin was excessively round, and slightly dimpled: and below it his neck and throat
                  seemed gladly to have met each other, forming a full, deep line beneath.</p>
               <p>He wore no coat over his shoulders, on the night to which we alludeâ€”nothing but a
                  huge waistcoat, that was entirely unbuttoned from the top to the bottom. The
                  neckcloth he usually wore about his neck was taken off and laid aside upon the
                  table. His shirtsleeves were likewise unfastened at the wrists, and partially
                  rolled up, exposing a broad and manly wrist and arm, that promised to be a tower
                  of defence in itself to almost any one. His breeches were made as easy as was
                  possible, and he had thrust his feet into a pair of leathern slippers.</p>
               <p>The man was ISRAEL PUTNAM, at that time in full command of the continental forces
                  in the city, while the commander-in-chief had absented himself to confer with the
                  congress then in session at Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>These were his quarters, almost in the heart of the city. He had been for a long
                  time laboring upon the perfection of the plans of defences for the city which had
                  been begun by General Lee, but which were early relinquished by that officer on
                  receiving orders from head-quarters to Charleston, which it was reasonably
                  supposed the enemy were about to attack.</p>
               <p>He had been alone in his apartment for only a brief time, when a knock came
                  suddenly upon the door, and a man obeyed his summons and entered.</p>
               <p>"Good evenin', General," saluted the stranger, pulling at the wilted brim of his
                  old felt, and finally taking it off altogether.</p>
               <p>"Ah, John Horton!" exclaimed the General: "is that you, John? I'm glad you've
                  come! What word do you bring, my faithful fellow?"</p>
               <p>"That there's dissatisfaction enough about the last order<ref rend="super"

                                    stopped; for that purpose, he has given positive orders that

               <p>"Not surely among true <emph>Americans?</emph>" inquired the General, turning
                  quite round and looking John Horton fully and fairly in the face.</p>
               <p>"No, General. No, indeed. It's only amongst them what are ruther more inclined to
                  toryism than to patriotism. And yit, they do love to call themselves Americans,
                  General. They'd feel awfully bad, if they thought everybody looked at 'em as
                  outright tories. I'm jest as much o' that opinion as I ever shall be of any
                  opinion whatever. The truth is, General, these cowardly fellers hate to come out
                  an' show their colors. They haint got courage enough to all a shell o' flaxseed,
                  and I'm sure I shouldn't know what we <emph>was</emph> agoin' to do, if we had to
                  depend on sich as them."</p>
               <p>"Have any of the respectable citizens yet tried to hold intercourse with any of
                  the ships in the harbor, that you know of?" asked the commander.</p>
               <p>"I know of one man, General, that's gone out in a little wherry to one of the
                  British ships, this very night!"</p>
               <p>"When will he return?"</p>
               <p>"To-night, I s'pose."</p>
               <p>"Who is he? Do you know?"</p>
               <p>"He's as respectable a man as there is in the town, and he's got money enough,
                  too. His name is Elton Edwards."</p>
               <p>"Can you take him as he comes back?"</p>
               <p>"If you will give me two or three men to give a feller a sort o' boost,
                  General."</p>
               <p>"You shall have them. How soon?"</p>
               <p>"Walâ€”say within a couple o' hours."</p>
               <p>"Strange that men persist in breaking over such regulations!" exclaimed General
                  Putnam, bringing his generous hand flatly down upon the table, and working up his
                  features to an expression of excited fervor.</p>
               <p>"So <emph>I</emph> tell 'em, General!" broke in old Verd-Antique; "so
                     <emph>I</emph> tell 'em, General! But, ye see, they don't know our
                     <emph>strength</emph> yet, nor our will, nor our <emph>determination.</emph>
                  When they have a chance to learn these, then they'll be more likely to respect
                  what their General says at his head-quarters."</p>
               <p>"We must take that man if it can be done," continued the commander, hurriedly
                  wiping the perspiration that stood in big drops, from his broad brow.</p>
               <p>"And I can do it, with a leetle help!"</p>
               <p>"Then have it done at once. Here!"</p>
               <p>General Putnam leaned over to the table again, and drew up an order for a file of
                  men to accompany John Horton on an enterprise he had planned for that night,
                  directing that they should confide in and implicitly obey him and all his orders.
                  Handing this to the queer-looking man, the latter expressed a profusion of thanks
                  for the same, and immediately left the room.</p>
               <p>The General at once relapsed into his wonted silence and deep reflection.</p>
               <p>Let us follow, with the reader, the course of John Horton.</p>
               <p>Giving his order to a proper officer, signed in the hand of the General himself,
                  he speedily received the assistance of three men of the garrison, who tramped away
                  at a rapid pace with him.</p>
               <p>They passed on through several streets, and lanes, and dark alleys, with him,
                  observing an unbroken silence as they went along, until they reached the edge of
                  the water on the North River side. Arrived there, they lay in close ambush,
                  awaiting the order of their strange superior.</p>
               <p>"Now, men!" began he, "jest as soon's I give you the word, you've only got to form
                  a ring round the man that'll be pinted out to ye. Don't be in none
                     <emph>too</emph> great a hurryâ€”for haste makes waste, you know, and 'twould be
                  a long sight better to not tech the feller at all, than to lose him arter all's
                  said and done. Don't ye think so?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes!" went up from each throat, their own are being probably glad to have an
                  opportunity to converse with their leader, at any price.</p>
               <p>"But who is he?" asked one of the three, grown suddenly emboldened with the
                  license thus indirectly offered by the speech of Verd-Antique.</p>
               <p>"That's what I don't tell right away, I don't" replied he.</p>
               <p>"Have you seen him?"</p>
               <p>"In course I have, then."</p>
               <p>"And there'll be no mistake about his coming back this way to-night?"</p>
               <p>"Don't ask too many questions," said Verd-Antique, somewhat pettishly. "jest obey
                  orders, and I guess we shall go along purty slick. The man'll be back again before
                  a very great while, and then <emph>our</emph> fun 'll begin, if we do but manage
                  it right and you all obey orders."</p>
               <p>"We will? we will!" all three of them answered simultaneously.</p>
               <p>Scarcely had the words escaped his lips, when the sound of oars in the row-locks
                  came over the still water, and all three listened. The silence was almost
                  painful.</p>
               <p>"Yes, it's the old feller, I <emph>guess!</emph>" whispered Verd-Antique. "Now lay
                  jest as low's ye can, and for God's sake, don't say a syllable! The minnit I say
                  'stuboy' to ye, there'll be plenty o' time for ye to go in and surround him. Now
                  wilt ye all remember?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," was the response of all.</p>
               <p>"Jest obey orders," continued he, by way of an impressive finale, "and all 'll go
                  right! Mind now!"</p>
               <p>They waited in a state of almost breathless anxiety for the approach of the boat.
                  The night was dark, and the whole sky was overhung with clouds. Scarcely a rift of
                  clear sky was anywhere to be seen overhead. A light wind moaned and whistled along
                  the still water's surface, bringing damp breaths to their temples, and in a manner
                  refreshing and renewing their spirits; otherwise it was freighted with melancholy
                  suggestions and influences.</p>
               <p>Occasionally, there came across the water the faint holloa of some boatman or
                  sailor on board the enemy's vessels, and then they felt themselves suddenly in
                  spired with a new courage; for the sound of their enemies' voices was quite enough
                  to strengthen their hearts and make them desirous of some opportunity for
                  immediate action. While they lay and listened to these varied sounds, they were
                  warned by the quite distinct sound of oars, plashing in the water, and groaning in
                  the row-locks, that the object for which they had come on this expedition was
                  close at hand. They accordingly pricked up their ears, and peered through the
                  almost blanket darkness as best they could.</p>
               <p>Pretty soon they discovered the outline of a boat, and almost in an instant
                  afterwards, the figures of two men sitting upright in the same. It seemed as if
                  they could scarcely restrain themselves from leaping at once out of their
                  temporary covert and springing upon them; even before they had effected a landing.
                  It certainly spoke well for their trusty hearts, and the inclinations that
                  prompted them.</p>
               <p>As soon as the passengerâ€”as he appeared to beâ€”had leaped from the boat to the
                  shore, the boatmen pushed rapidly off from the same and disappeared in the
                  gathering darkness. Undoubtedly it was nothing new for him to be employed in such
                  interdicted business, and he had experimentally learned that there was quite as
                  much valor, oftentimes, and a trifle more safety in flight than in hazardous
                  pertinacity. He was wise that he fled from the view of the infuriated
                  ambuscaders.</p>
               <p>The passenger had scarcely walked a dozen steps from the tracks he made where he
                  leaped on the shore when Verd-Antique gave an expressive signal to his men, and at
                  once started from his hiding-place.</p>
               <p>"Where do you come from, at this time o' night?" demanded Verd-Antique, very
                  gruffly, and with an air of authority.</p>
               <p>He had already thrown his arms about his prisoner, who found himself struggling as
                  within the relentless embrace of a vice.</p>
               <p>"Who are you? Be off! What will you with me!" asked and ordered the captured man,
                  in a tone of frenzy and rage.</p>
               <p>"What is your business on the water at this time o' night?" demanded
                  Verd-Antique.</p>
               <p>"That which doesn't concern such as you! Let me loose, I say; or I'll have the
                  heavens about your ears in less time than you can get ready for them."</p>
               <p>"Brave talk that for a tory!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Tory!</emph>" muttered the prisoner, contemptuously, between his
                  tightly-closed teeth.</p>
               <p>"Yes, you are that, aint you?" asked the leader of the captors.</p>
               <p>"No matter what I am! Let me loose, I sayâ€”and that, too, at once!" replied the
                  prisoner.</p>
               <p>"Guess you'll give a short account o' yerself fust," drily spoke Verd-Antique.</p>
               <p>"I'll do no such thing! I am a free man, with the right to go where I please!"</p>
               <p>"Not while you live inside o' our lines you haint," said the unique John
                  Horton.</p>
               <p>"A graceless set of rebels and cut-throat scamps you are, all of you!" exclaimed
                  the prisoner. "What you can't make in an honest way, you manage to get by robbing
                  and stealing!"</p>
               <p>"If ye don't fall into no worse hands than <emph>ourn</emph> are to-night, I guess
                  ye'll stan a dreadful small chance o' bein' <emph>robbed!</emph> Jest put me down
                  as bein' good for the truth o' that, will ye?"</p>
               <p>"I say, let me go! I'm a free citizen,â€”â€”"</p>
               <p>"But not an American citizen. You never was born here, and you haint got our ways
                  yit, exactly. But jest come along with us. There aint but little danger that
                  you'll learn any tew much of our ways, and what you dew I guess won't hurt you
                  none Come, bring the rope, boys!"</p>
               <p>One of the young men stepped forward to obey the command given him. What was his
                  surprise at looking closely into the face of the prisoner, to find that it really
                  was no other than Mr. Elton Edwards.</p>
               <p>The young man who was so unfortunate as to make the discovery, wasâ€”â€”Henry Byram,
                  the betrothed of his own daughter.</p>
               <p>But the father did not recognize him.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE PUNISHMENT.</head>
               <p>EARLY the next morning, the General started off from his quarters to make a visit
                  at the guard-house, and take a review of the private proceedings of the past
                  night.</p>
               <p>He wore the plain dress of a common citizen, and passed along with that easy gait
                  and sir that wonderfully helped to make him feel perfectly at home any where. But
                  although he made no show of false and stilted dignity in his own person, his
                  character was sufficiently the theme of admiration, and the subject of respect
                  among his fellow officers and the soldiery to draw out from them marks of decided
                  warmth and affection. As he passed one and another, therefore, they touched their
                  hats respectfully to him, accompanying the significant gesture with profoundly low
                  bows. All these tokens of respect were duly recognised and returned by the
                  General.</p>
               <p>Arrived at the guard-house, he walked up to the morning officer in command, and
                  saluted him with:</p>
               <p>"Major Fay, good morning!"</p>
               <p>"Good morning, my dear General! Good morning, your excellency!"</p>
               <p>"How is the guard-room this morning? Full?"</p>
               <p>"There are but three in it," was the reply of the subordinate.</p>
               <p>"But three?" musingly repeated the General. "I am heartily glad there is such a
                  falling off."</p>
               <p>"None more so than we all are, General. I hope that the citizens are all of them
                  beginning to see for themselves the necessity of uniting upon some decisive and
                  patriotic course. I hope they will soon cease to be troubled about the name
                     <emph>rebel,</emph> and infuse into the expression a meaning of patriotism and
                  dignity. But it will never be done until people dare to think, and feel, and act
                  for themselves. This haggling and bantering, General, is not going to make us a
                  nation.</p>
               <p>The commander's gray eyes lit up with a patriotic<pb n="10-11"
                     xml:id="VAC6939-00000006"/> glow on hearing this comparatively young man thus
                  descanting on the necessity of an union of popular sentiments. But he suddenly
                  bethought himself of the immediate business on which he had come, and and inquired
                  for what the three men were particularly confined.</p>
               <p>"Two of them were arrested for attempting to pass the sentry without giving the

               <p>"And the otherâ€”the third prisoner?" inquired the General.</p>
               <p>"He was brought in for having been over to the enemy's boats. He is a rich man,
                  too, and a respectable citizen."</p>
               <p>"Are you sure he had been to the vessels of the enemy?"</p>
               <p>"Quite sure of it. Those who brought him in asserted that he was taken in the very
                  act of landing again on our shore,"</p>
               <p>"<emph>That</emph> would seem to be proof enough," replied the General,
                  thoughtfully.</p>
               <p>"The men can be ordered in, in a moment, who took him," said the officer.</p>
               <p>"It had best be done soon, then"</p>
               <p>"At once, General?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. Bring in the two men, who were arrested for trying to pass the lines, first.
                  In the room yonder,' continued he, pointing towards it with his hand and moving in
                  the direction of it himself.</p>
               <p>Major Fay bowed assent to the orders of his General, and instantly moved away
                  towards the guardroom. In less than three minutes time, the two men were brought
                  into the room where sat the American General, in charge of a sergeant They stood
                  before him, eyeing him sullenly and silently for some time. What were their
                  thoughts, it is impossible for us to conjecture. They might even at that moment
                  have been contrasting in their minds the state of things under an outright
                  anarchy, and under an union of republican heartsâ€”an union cemented by the
                  strongest associations by which it is possible for human nature to be bound. Or
                  they might have been studying up some nefarious plot, by which they might be the
                  means of great wrong and injustice to the commander who sat before them, as well
                  as to the entire forces that were subject to his control within the city. Or,
                  still farther, they might have been calculating, in obedience to the avarice that
                  seemed to be busily at work within them, how much advantage it might finally be
                  made to them, if they would but openly come out and enlist in the needy
                  continental army.</p>
               <p>It is of no essential consequence, however, which of these three subjects might,
                  or might not, have been puzzling their brains. They regarded General Putnam with
                  fixed and decidedly surly looks, which their very dress betokened were the
                  expressions hearts predisposed to malice and inveterate hatred,</p>
               <p>"You were taken in the act of trying to pass the lines, last night," said the
                  General. "What have you to say for yourselves?"</p>
               <p>The men hung down their heads, gazing abstractedly upon the floor and making no
                  reply.</p>
               <p>"You had not the countersign," continued the General, half turning in his chair.
                  "Why did you not procure one?"</p>
               <p>No answer.</p>
               <p>"Dumb, hey?" said the General, not a little piqued at their sullen obstinacy.
                  "Were you in pursuit of honest business, when you were captured?"</p>
               <p>Still no reply.</p>
               <p>"Answer me <emph>that</emph> if you wish to have the privilege of exculpating
                  yourselves at all!"</p>
               <p>He waited to have them explain their conduct, if they could; out they appeared to
                  take no notice whatever of the privilege he extended to them. This only
                  exasperated him the more; and he called out to the guard in an almost stentorian
                  voice:</p>
               <p>"Guard! Remand these men to prison! keep them confined in separate rooms for three
                  days, and allow them nothing but bread and water to eat! Away with the fellows!"
                  and he waved his hand commandingly towards the door.</p>
               <p>At once they were removed from the room, and in a few minutes the officer of the
                  morning entered.</p>
               <p>"The rascals would answer nothing for their conduct, Major Fay," said the General,
                  his eye kindling as he spoke, and the blood mantling faintly his bronzed
                  cheek.</p>
               <p>"Nothing, eh? said the officer.</p>
               <p>"Not a single syllable. I have ordered them into solitary confinement for three
                  days, and they are to be kept on nothing but bread and water so far as you are
                  concerned, see to it that this order is strictly obeyed."</p>
               <p>"I will, General," was the ready reply.</p>
               <p>"And now have other prisoner brought in the one who was taken in the act of
                  landing from the British ships. This is an offence that cannot be passed over
                  lightly, and yet consistently with good order in the city. Our Prohibitory Order
                  must be enforced."</p>
               <p>"You would see those who took him, also, General?" said Major Fay,
                  inquiringly.</p>
               <p>"No, no matter. I would first see him alone. Bring him in now."</p>
               <p>Major Fay immediately left the room. He returned, however, in a short time.
                  bringing along with him the prisoner who had been captured by Verd-Antique and his
                  associates on the Hudson River shore, the evening before.</p>
               <p>As he entered the room, he cast his eyes rapidly about it, and then let them fall
                  on the officer who sat in the chair before him. The latter instantly waved his
                  hand to Major Fay, to signify to him his desire that the room should be vacated,
                  and he accordingly left him.</p>
               <p>"You are properly a prisoner, Mr. Edwards," said the General, as soon as he was
                  satisfied that they were alone.</p>
               <p>Mr. Edwards started at hearing his name called by the commander, wondering how it
                  should have become known to him.</p>
               <p>"You stand charged with having disobeyed a military order, which prohibits an
                  inhabitant from passing over to the enemy's ship. What have you to say, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Why should I be obliged to say <emph>anything?</emph>" he replied. "I do not hold
                  myself accountable to the American army, nor to any one of its officers, for my
                  conduct."</p>
               <p>"Plainly spoken, sir," said the General; "very plainly spoken, indeed! But let me
                  assure you, sir, that so long as you and your propertyâ€”of which I hear you have no
                  special lackâ€”are upon American soil, which it requires American arms to defend
                  from foreign aggression, you <emph>are</emph> accountable to the American
                  authorities; of which you will recognize one in my person. If you choose to lend
                  your assistance to the British against the country that has so long protected and
                  fostered you, and in which you have succeeded in accumulating a liberal
                  fortune,â€”then pass over to their lines at <emph>once,</emph> and when once there,
                  be sure that you <emph>stay</emph> there; Join their army, and go in their hostile
                  flocks up and down our coast, sending terror wherever you go, and breaking up the
                  security and safeguards of the society that has nurtured you for so many years! If
                  you wish to do this, do it! But you cannot be allowed to be running our lines, and
                  carrying information and mischief over to the enemy. That has been prohibited by a
                  special order; and you are arrested and brought here for disobeying that
                  order."</p>
               <p>There was a feeling of deep indignation burning in the bosom of the General, at
                  the time when these words passed his lips, which it would not have been possible
                  for the prisoner to allow to pass unobserved. The General could not help thinking
                  at the moment how ungrateful the man was toward the country that had so long
                  sheltered him, and to the people who had for so many years helped him in the
                  accumulation and enjoyment of his fortune, undisturbed.</p>
               <p>"I do not <emph>profess</emph> to be an American," said the prisoner, after a
                  short pause.</p>
               <p>"Then are you a tory?" asked the General, more deeply stirred with indignation
                  than before. "That is what we want to know, and to know at once!"</p>
               <p>"I do not side with the American peopleâ€”that is, with those who are in rebellion
                  against their king."</p>
               <p>"Do you call an honest defence a rebellion? Is <emph>that</emph> what you would be
                  meant to say? <emph>Rebels</emph> and <emph>rebellion</emph> indeed! If
                     <emph>these</emph> are your opinions, it is truly high time that you had your
                  license to visit the enemy and return to our shores, revoked!â€”high time, air!"</p>
               <p>"I shall never take up arms against my king," added the prisoner, not a little
                  abashed by the firm and determined tone in which the commander confronted him.</p>
               <p>"Then you will not against the country of your adoption! You will never do
                     <emph>that</emph> sir, while you are within American lines!"</p>
               <p>"No; but have I done it yet?"</p>
               <p>"You have done what it its exact equivalent, sir."</p>
               <p>"What is that?"</p>
               <p>"You <emph>know</emph> as well as I do, We all know what you have done."</p>
               <p>"I protest my ignorance of what you mean," replied the doggedly obstinate
                  prisoner.</p>
               <p>"Were you not on board a British vessel only the last night?"</p>
               <p>"And what if I was?"</p>
               <p>"Is not <emph>that</emph> taking up arms against our citizens and people?"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps not."</p>
               <p>"Of a surety, <emph>it is!</emph>â€”and for that you are arrested. You have
                  flagrantly and willfully disobeyed an army order, and we have to answer for it
                  this morning. In consideration of your hitherto respectable character as a
                  citizen, I have consented to come and pass judgment upon you myself."</p>
               <p>"I esteem the compliment highly," rejoined the prisoner, in a tone evidently
                  intended to be deeply sarcastic.</p>
               <p>The color flew like the flash of a flame to the forehead of the General.</p>
               <p>"You are <emph>a tory,</emph> sir! exclaimed he, in an exasperated voice. "You
                  would be <emph>a spy,</emph> if you dared! You are <emph>a coward,</emph> in any
                  event! For your contempt of our regulations, you must suffer the penalty."</p>
               <p>"What is that?"</p>
               <p>"Imprisonement."</p>
               <p>"For how lung?"</p>
               <p>"Were not this an aggravated offence, I should be loth to pass so severe a
                  sentence upon you. In the circumstances by which you are surrounded in life, you
                  should certainly have known better than to attempt so base an act as you have been
                  guilty of. You have shown yourself an open and a vowed enemy of your country, and
                  it is hardly safe that you should at present be allowed your liberty. The army is
                  compelled to protect itself, at any and all hazards, even if individuals have to
                  be quite plentifully sacrificed!"</p>
               <p>"And I suppose they <emph>will</emph> be," interrupted the prisoner.</p>
               <p>"If there by many such as you have shown <emph>yourself,</emph> there will be
                  probably a good crop of them to gather in." responded the General. "But I have no
                  words to waste longer with you. If I thought you desirous of being enlightened
                  upon the state of our affairs with the mother country, so as to assume the
                  attitude you conscientiously thought you ought to in this emergency, I would let
                  you into a knowledge of many things of which you are now ignorant, and will
                  probably long remain so. It is enough for me to know what your feelings are. Your
                     <emph>conduct</emph> I shall take it upon myself to visit with the punishment
                  it deserves.<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6939-00000007"/> I herewith order that you be
                  confined in solitary imprisonment for the term of ten daysâ€”on and after the
                  present date!"</p>
               <p>The prisoner bowed slightly, and gave the General a piercing look; but it was
                  returned with one from the latter, so full of expressive indignation, and deep,
                  unspeakable contempt for his littleness of soul, that he fairly quailed before it,
                  and let his eyes drop almost instantly upon the floor.</p>
               <p>Immediately the General rapped heavily on the floor beside him, and Major Fay
                  entered, attended by a guard, bearing a musket on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>"Ten days' solitary imprisonment!" ordered the General, partly rising from his
                  chair. "This business must be stopped here, exactly where it is! There must
                  certainly be virtue enough, and courage enough, and determination enough to put an
                  end to it!"</p>
               <p>As he spoke these words, he waved his hand in the direction of the door, and they
                  proceeded at once to march their prisoner away to the apartment in which he was to
                  pass his imposed punishment.</p>
               <p>The heart of the wealthy man rose in his breast at beholding himself thus
                  ignominiously escorted to a prisoner's apartment, when he had so comfortable a
                  house of his own in waiting for his reception. He could not help inwardly cursing
                  the rebels to whom he owed his capture, and thinking of the disgrace that attached
                  to his present situation His proud spirit very naturally chafed under the
                  insultâ€”as he deemed itâ€”and he vowed at some future day to have his revenge. He
                  thought it would be sweet to him, when it did come, for the insult and contumely
                  were so difficult to bear now.</p>
               <p>With a measured tread, and with a turbulent thought at each forward step, he
                  marched away through a long hall, or passage way, until he reached a flight of
                  stairs. Here he paused and asked the guard if he was to ascend them.</p>
               <p>"Assuredly," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"Then my coming down may be worse for some of you than my going up!" said he,
                  mumbling it between his teeth.</p>
               <p>To this uncalled-for remark no reply was offered. They only marched him up the
                  stairs, and pushed on along another passage-way until they reached the door of the
                  apartment specially set apart for his confinement. It was unlocked by one of his
                  conductors, and he was ordered to go in; which he did with a degree of reluctance
                  that readily betrayed the feelings that were working with such violence within his
                  breast.</p>
               <p>As soon as he was fairly imprisoned, the key was turned upon him, and he was left
                  alone to eke out the sentence that would hang so heavily upon him.</p>
               <p>His rage, at this time, exceeded all bounds imaginable.</p>

               <head type="sub">A TURTLE AMONGST THE SHIPPING.</head>
               <p>IT was a fresh, incense-breathing morning in the latter part of June. The sun had
                  risen clear and golden, and the roofs, and peaks, and gables, and spires of the
                  city were bathed in its stainless sheen. The water slept calmly in the river and
                  the bay, scarce a breath of wind blowing over to ruffie its crystal-pure surface.
                  Upon the distant horizon, seaward, rested a long and lazy wreath of light mist,
                  which it needed but the approaching beams of the sun to dissipate into thin air
                  again.</p>
               <p>General Putnam was leisurely walking backwards and forwards upon the wharf,
                  seemingly intent upon no particular purpose; but to one who might have been
                  disposed to watch him closely and alternatively, he would have appeared to be
                  occupied about something of more than usual interest and importance. He looked
                  carefully and guardedly all around him to see that he was not observed, and then
                  strained his gaze far away over the water. In this attitude he remained for a long
                  time.</p>
               <p>He was interrupted at last by being accosted by a voice that seemed strange to
                  him; and hastily turning himself about, he saw the person of Verd-Antique
                  approaching him</p>
               <p>"Good mornin', Gen'ral!" accosted the strange character who was the cause of the
                  interruption.</p>
               <p>"John Horton!" exclaimed the General, "is that <emph>you?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Me, Gen'ral," he answered. "I git up in the mornin', I do, myself! Gen'ral, my
                  best respects to ye!"</p>
               <p>"And mine to yourself, John," answered the General, who certainly seemed in all
                  particulars on excessively easy terms with the oddity whom he was addressing.
                  "What news do you bring me, John? You're always wide awake for what's going
                  on!"</p>
               <p>"I got no news, Gen'ral," said the man, "but what you must have long ago have got
                  yourself. I have just come from a tramp into Westchester, and over into the edge
                  of Connecticut."</p>
               <p>"Is all going on well there?"</p>
               <p>"It is in Connecticut, your honor; in Westchester I didn't see so much a-goin' on.
                  You see, I had a leetle bizness in the woods, and didn't go out much into the
                  state o' civilization."</p>
               <p>"You are a strange fellow, John; what do you think will come of your roving
                  habits? Can you tell, do you think?"</p>
               <p>All this time, the eye of the practised old veteran was busily watching a dark
                  looking object that seemed to be making its way over towards Governor's Island and
                  even then could not be very far from the shore.</p>
               <p>"Good, I hope," answered John Horton to the interrogatory of his commander. "But
                  what d'ye see away there, Gen'ral?" he continued.</p>
               <p>The General did not at once proceed to make him any answer.</p>
               <p>"Anything very pertikler, Gen'ral?" again inquired old Verd-Antique.</p>
               <p>"Do you see that black object yonder?" asked he, pointing in the direction in
                  which he had been looking.</p>
               <p>"Whatâ€”'way yender, d'ye mean?" inquired Verd-Antique Antique, pointing with his
                  finger in turn. "Yes, I dew, Gen'ral," he replied, after a pause; during which he
                  gave himself up abstractly to the contemplation of the object.</p>
               <p>"Well, I want you to take a whale boat from the wharf here, and go out and bring
                  it to the shore. Can you do it at once?"</p>
               <p>"You needn't ask me no sich question as that but <emph>onst,</emph> Gen'ral; I
                  always make it a pint of honor to obey every one o' your orders. I hope I may
                  never see the day that Gen'ral Israel Putnam, that fit so like a tiger and a brave
                  man against the cuesed Injuns, will want my help and not git it. Yes, I'll go,
                  Gen'ral; <emph>in course,</emph> I'll go."</p>
               <p>"It must be done cautiously."</p>
               <p>"I'm your man <emph>there!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"And kept a secret, too," added the commander.</p>
               <p>"I can keep a secret a long ways better nor I kin keep my money, or my terbarker;
                  nairy one on'em aint so easy to keep as this 'ere one thing is. I was allers purty
                  good for a secret, Gen'ral; try me now."</p>
               <p>"That is an internal machine, John,â€”"</p>
               <p>"A what?" exclaimed he, his eyes extending themselves to their widest, and his
                  lower jaw dropping in-considerately upon his breast.</p>
               <p>"An internal machine;â€”"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Infernal!</emph> I won't have nothin' to dew with it then," he replied, his
                  features expressing a' feeling of terror and repulsiveness.</p>
               <p>"Then there's all there is about it," added the General, with much emphasis,
                  betokening that he was not altogether pleased with the sudden summersault John
                  Horton had turned. "I must go and find some one else: for the thing must be got
                  back."</p>
               <p>"It's a sure case, then, is it, Gen'ral?" broke in the wondering man.</p>
               <p>"Yes; it must be got ashore, and at once, too. If it falls into the hands of the
                  enemy, it may do us much mischief. We must, by all meansâ€”"</p>
               <p>"Say no more, Gen'ral," he bawled out; "say no more. I'm after it, if it's
                     <emph>the Devil's own self,</emph> instead of one o' his mersheens. I don't
                  care a fig for life, nor money, nor nothin' else: only put me onto the track o'
                  anything I see the enemy's arter, and I don't stan' tew ask whether it's a-goin'
                  tew be a safe speculation or not. I feel John Horton-ish all over, at sich a time;
                  and I feel confoundedly so this very minute. I'll go now, Gen'ral!"</p>
               <p>"Can you find a boat?"</p>
               <p>"Ef I can't, then I swear I'll <emph>swim!</emph> I'll git there, and git hold o'
                  that 'ere infernal critter afore anybody's had a chance to see it."</p>
               <p>With these words, he started off in quest of a boat. The next his commander saw of
                  him, he was shooting out over the sleeping water of the bay as rapidly as two
                  bending, pliant oars and a pair of stout and sinewy arms could propel him. General
                  Putnam watched him with a deep anxiety that plainly gave an expression to his
                  usually pleasant countenance. It was at this time overcast with clouds.</p>
               <p>The agile hunter rowed dexterously until he had almost reached the shore of
                  Governor's Island; when he suddenly shipped his oars, and, leaning far over the
                  gunwale of his boat, drew a dark substance of no inconsiderable size into the boat
                  with him. Then casting a look all about the water in every direction, he turned
                  his prow about and rowed back to shore quite as rapidly as he had originally gone
                  out.</p>
               <p>When he reached the place where the General still continued to stand, he passed
                  the 'machine' up to him, with some considerable exertion, and then proceeded to
                  climb the wharf after it.</p>
               <p>"Now you air a goin' tew tell me what that critter is," said he, when he had
                  fairly caught his breathâ€”"and what it's for. I never brought no sich lookin'
                  things as <emph>that</emph> about with me afore, and I cal'late to know jest
                  exactly what 'tis. May the Devil have me if I ever see sich a thing in all my life
                  afore."</p>
               <p>"I told you it was an infernal machine," answered the old General."</p>
               <p>"Yes, but I don't know no better now,' replied Verd Antique.</p>
               <p>"You don't, hey? Well, it belongs properly to a boat, which is called by the
                  inventor "A TURTLE."<ref rend="super" target="#note_003" xml:id="return_003"

                   It was made to blow up ships with; but remember you, it's all a secret

                  <p><ref target="#return_003">*</ref>The "<hi rend="i"/>American Turtle" was the name given to a highly ingenious
                     and philosophical invention of Mr. David Bushnell. A. M, of Saybrook,
                     Connecticut. We are indebted to Colonel Humphreys, a distinguished friend
                     and biographer of General Putnam, for the following account of it,
                     substantially: <emph>A machine,</emph> altogether different from anything
                     devised by the art of man, was invented by Mr. Bushnell, for the purpose of
                     submarine navigation, which was found to answer the purpose perfectly,
                     <unclear>of</unclear> rowing horizontally at any given depth under the
                     water, and of rising or sinking at pleasure. To this machine was attached
                     <emph>a magazine of powder,</emph> which it was purposed to secure to the
                     bottom of a ship with a driving screwâ€”the screw so arranged that the same
                     stroke that disengaged it from the machine, should likewise set an internal
                     clock-work in motion. This once done, the snapping of a gun-lock, a half
                     hour afterwards, an hour, or at any determinate point of time, would cause
                     the powder to explore, and <emph>leave the results to themselves!</emph> The
                     inventor, being unfortunately of a feeble constitution, was unable to
                     perform the severe labor of rowing and managing the 'Turtle,' and
                     consequently had taught a brother of his own to manage it with perfect
                     dexterity; but as ill-luck would have it, his brother also fell sick of a
                     fever just before the arrival of the British fleet off New York waters.
                     Recourse was therefore had to a sergeant in the Connecticut troops, who,
                     having received all the instructions necessary that could be communicated to
                     him in the short interval that remained, went at too late an hour at night
                     under one of the enemy's sixty four gun ships, with all the apparatus needed
                     for a grand blow-up.</p>
                  <p>The result will meet the eyes of the reader in the natural course of the
                     story.</p>
                  <p>If it should not, however, weary too much the reader's attention, we would
                     like to append a brief account of the incident that occurred in the
                     neighborhood of Philadelphia, in the year succeeding.</p>
                  <p>About Christmas, in 1777. Mr. Bushnell committed to the Delaware river a
                     flotilla of kegs, each one of which was furnished with a machine and
                     magazine similar to those described above. These kegs were destined to fall
                     among the British fleet, then anchored in the Delaware at Philadelphia; but
                     his squadron of kegs, having been separated and retarded by the ice,
                     destroyed but a single vessel This catastrophe, however, produced an alarm
                     among the enemy, the like of which was scarcely ever heard of before; and it
                     was faithfully represented in the following song by the Hon. Francis
                     Hopkinson,â€”a song that deserves to be published over again in this
                     connexion, as being one of those quaint relies of revolutionary times, of
                     which, we fear, the minds of each successive generation are becoming more
                     and more oblivious. Here it is: <q>

               <p>"I know all <emph>that</emph> well enough," replied he, becoming deeply engaged in
                  what he heard. "I shan't forget my promise, Gen'ral."</p>
               <p>"Well," continued the General, "if you watch matters close enough, and long
                  enough, you <emph>may</emph> see<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6939-00000008"/> a small
                  blow-up in the shipping yonder. The magazine of powder that belongs to this
                  machine was fastened to the bottom of the Eagle, on board which is Admiral Howe,
                  at this minute."</p>
               <p>"You don't say so, Gen'ral?" exclaimed the astonished man, his features assuming
                  every conceivable expression of wonder and unbelief.</p>
               <p>"Yes I do say so too," replied he; "if you will wait here long enough, I imagine
                  you will be treated to the sight of at least a water spout, if nothing more. It
                  will all be luch and chance, whether the powder is under the vessel now or not.
                  The matter wasn't arranged as it ought to have been; and yet, there could not
                  anything more have been done, under the circumstances. The man who rowed under the
                  Eagle didn't get away till quite late in the night, and he has brought me word
                  that he wasn't quite sure whether the screw would hold fast to the bottom of the
                  vessel or not. We shall see, I presume, before long, if we do but wait;" and with
                  these words, General Putnam directed his gaze still more earnestly towards the
                  distant shipping.</p>
               <p>"I wish you'd ha' gin <emph>me</emph> the job," exclaimed John Horton, bending his
                  own gaze in the same direction</p>
               <p>"Could you have done better, think you?" asked the General, never averting his
                  steadfast gaze in the slightest degree.</p>
               <p>"I think I'd ha' been purty sure to give old Howe a berth a good deal warmer 'n
                  any he's had <emph>yet.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you <emph>could</emph> have gone, John, if I had known where you were. I
                  can never find you when I want you; and when I'm thinking of everybody and
                  everything else but you, who is there to appear before me but your own selfâ€”just
                  as you have this very morning."</p>
               <p>"It's all very true, Gen'ral; it's true, every word on't, as I'm a livin' man. But
                  what can I do? I <emph>want</emph> to do everything, all in one day. I want to be
                  here, and I want to be there, all 't the same minnit. If I should jine the army in
                  a reg'lar sort o' way, as I s'pose I orter, why then I sh'd miss o' seein'
                  somethin' else, that I wouldn't miss of for nothin'. No, Gen'ral; no, I can't. I'd
                  like to be by your side all the time, Gen'ral, a seein' and a-doin'; but I have so
                     <emph>many</emph> ways to go, and so <emph>many</emph> folks a callin', that if
                  I do but the half of what I set out to. I'm satisfied. It's wand'rin' life I lead,
                  Gen'ral, but I've got use to it. I was a human <emph>onst,</emph> but I've a'most
                  got over that</p>
               <p>weakness. I use to love socierty, and go into that that was respectable and good,
                  you know, <emph>onst;</emph> but that day's gone clean by. I've took to the woods
                  purty much, lately; only if I can find out where there's any fightin' goin' on,
                  I'm on the spot as soon as any on 'em; jest count me good for the truth o' that,
                  will ye, Gen'ral?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I've had proof enough of your courage and your patriotism already, John,"
                  replied the General, "to doubt that you will be lacking when the muster roll is
                  called <emph>now</emph>"</p>
               <p>"No, that aint <emph>me,</emph> Gen'ral; it's not <emph>my</emph> name that'll go
                  unanswered to when the roll's bein' called, or the fightin's bein' done. I say I'm
                  on hand for that Genral."</p>
               <p>"See thereâ€”look there, John!" suddenly exclaimed his commander, pointing towards
                  the distant shipping.</p>
               <p>"Sure enough. Merciful God!" rejoined John Horton, raising both hands. "The
                  infernal machine has begun to spout, sure enough."</p>
               <p>In the direction in which their eyes were turned, there suddenly arose from the
                  water, in the immediate vicinity of the shipping, a vast column of water, to an
                  astonishing height. Accompanying it, there could be heard a deep and sullen
                  report, sounding quite as much like a distant earthquake, the rush of a falling
                  meteor, or the distant explosion of a bomb, as anything that could be
                  imagined.</p>
               <p>"That's the magazine," remarked the General.</p>
               <p>"If't had only been right under the berth where Lord Howe slept!" replied John
                  Horton. "Oh, <emph>what</emph> a lift 'twould ha' gin him towards heavenâ€”further
                  up, I guess, than he'll ever be apt to git in any other way. Too had; too bad,
                  Gen'ral, entirely! But better luck next time. P'raps some on 'em 'll be tryin' to
                  find out what in thunder come up in that shape out o' the water, jest at the time
                  when there 'll be another porpoise-blow, somethin' arter this same fashion. I hope
                  this won't be the last on't, Gen'ral."</p>
               <p>"We must secrete this instrument somewhere soon," said the General; "for the sight
                  will be apt to attract people about the wharves."</p>
               <p>"Here's for ye, then," replied Verd-Antique, raising an end of the machine to his
                  shoulder, while the General took hold of the other and tugged stoutly and
                  courageously. In a few minutes, they had it hidden in a by-place where the latter
                  well enough knew it could be readily found at the time it would next be wanted,
                  and then nothing was to be seen of either of them.</p>
               <p>For many days after the singular phenomenon presented in the harbor, there was a
                  continued series of conjectures and theories explanatory in some measure of the
                  same. Some averred they saw a water-spout; others, that a huge whale must have
                  risen to blow; and there were others so skeptical as not to believe that any
                     <emph>common</emph> breed of whales could make a noise so loud and so
                  startling, as was heard early on the morning in question. So the matter remained
                  an unrevealed mystery to all but the commander himself, the person who manned the
                  boat on the expedition, and John Horton, the rover.</p>

               <head type="sub">A BRIEF INTERVIEW.</head>
               <p>WE have need to take the reader by the button-hole and go back a little way, to
                  the evening of the day on which Mr. Elton Edwards received his sentence of a ten
                  days' imprisonment.</p>
               <p>Young Henry Byram, the recently-enlisted soldier, who had been so unfortunateâ€”so
                  far as his own feelings, at least, were concernedâ€”as to be detached by his officer
                  upon the expedition that resulted in the capture and punishment of Mr. Edwards,
                  received permission to absent himself from his post for the evening and betook
                  himself as speedily as possible to the house of the prisoner's daughterâ€”Laura</p>
               <p>It was quite dark when he arrived at the door, where he was met by the person of
                  Laura herself, who had grown unaccountably anxious in consequence of the
                  protracted absence of her parent. At a little distance behind her in the hall,
                  likewise stood the servant Susan, grown almost as concerned about him as her young
                  mistress. Laura could not help starting back when she found that, instead of the
                  person at the door being her father, it was her lover.</p>
               <p>"Henry! Henry!" she exclaimed. "Is it you, indeed? How did you get here again to
                  me! Tell meâ€”have you seen anything of my father? Tell me, Henry! I cannot think
                  what has become of him. He has been gone since last evening, and we have been
                  unable to learn any tidings of him anywhere. I fear he may have fallen into some
                  sudden trouble; you know he is so staunch a friend to the king, and the soldiers
                  would not hear him say anything in his favor <emph>now.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Do not give yourself any farther trouble, my dear Laura," replied the young
                  soldier, taking her hand within both his own and pushing his way along into
                  hall.</p>
               <p>"Then have you seen him, Henry?"</p>
               <p>"Come in here and sit down with me, and I will tell you all," said he, in a tone
                  calculated as much as possible to comfort and console her. "Let us be alone,
                  too."</p>
               <p>Laura signified to her maid that she would dispense with her attentions for a
                  short period, and walked hurriedly with her lover into an adjoining room. They
                  seated themselves side by side upon an old fashioned, quaintly-carved, massive
                  sofa, or settee, whose framework and arms were of solid mahogany Drawing a small
                  stuffed cricket to her feet, Laura folded her hands within her lap and gazed with
                  a look of inquiry and deep anxiety into the young man's face, as it she would have
                  him begin.</p>
               <p>"I shall bring you joy, Laura," said he, "in <emph>one</emph> sense at least, by
                  what I am about to tell you; for you will know <emph>where</emph> your father
                     <emph>is,</emph> and that may afford you much consolation"</p>
               <p>"It willâ€”it certainly will! Then you indeed know where he is, Henry?" interrupted
                  she, with much and strong feeling.</p>
               <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6939-00000009"/>
               <p>A cloud passed over the spirits of the young man, for he knew that when she came
                  to know the entire sequel, all her hopeful joy would again be dashed in a thousand
                  fragments to the earth. But he went on, trying to be regardless of all this.</p>
               <p>"But I may bring sorrow too, with my intelligence, Laura."</p>
               <p>"Why so, Henry?" asked she.</p>
               <p>"Let me tell you the whole, then; and may you forgive me as I deserve to be
                  forgiven for doing that, which only as a soldier, and obedient to the commands of
                  my superiors, I should have done at all!"</p>
               <p>"What mean you, Henry?" she demanded. "You perplex me with riddles; I do not
                  understand you!"</p>
               <p>"This is the story: last night, I was ordered by my commanding officer to form one
                  of a small scouting party that was to be sent out to make a prisoner of a person
                  who was known at the time to have gone over to the British vessels in the harbor.
                  Of course I was obliged to go, without a why or a wherefore. In such a case,
                  Laura, a soldier is privileged to ask no questions, and a <emph>true</emph>
                  soldier never <emph>thinks</emph> of asking one. He goes straight forward, just
                  when and where he is ordered.</p>
               <p>"We were under the guidance of a strangerâ€”a curious-looking man as I ever remember
                  to have seen. I did not know his name and did not ask it. He seemed to know
                  exactly where he was going, and said not a word to any of us. After we had gone to
                  the river and lain in ambush there for some time, we heard the plashing of oars in
                  the water. We knew it was this for which our guide and commander was waiting, and
                  we listened attentively. The sounds came nearer and nearer to us. He made us a
                  sign to preserve a continued silence, until he should give us the watchword when
                  to start.</p>
               <p>"The suspense was painful to us. The night, as you may yourself remember, was
                  dark, and the sky was well blanketed with thick clouds. We could hardly see
                  anything before us. But we could hear the sound of the oars in the rowlocks, and
                  their plashing in the water. And presently the boat drew quite upon the beach, and
                  we readily detected the indistinct figures of two persons in it. One of them
                  appeared to be a passenger, and the other, the oarsman. Just as soon as they
                  reached the shore, the passenger leaped out and landed, while the wary boatman
                  whirled his boat partially round and cast off; and in another moment he was lost
                  to us in the darkness.</p>
               <p>"As soon as our guide saw the stranger fairly on shore, he made us a sign to
                  follow him and make the passenger our prisoner. We sprang from our places quicker
                  than a flash, and stood at his side. Our guide charged him with being a tory, and
                  with going over to the enemy's boats. He seemed obstinate and indignant, and
                  demanded loudly to be let loose again but we had no idea of letting him off so
                  easily, now that he had been detected in the act of returning from the boats of
                  the enemyâ€”an offence that we could not overlook. The guide ordered one of us to
                  hand him a rope, that he might secure him with it, and carry him safely away to
                  the guard-house. I sprang towards him with the rope, and for the first time was
                  enabled to have a close view of the prisoner's face. You can imagine my surprise,
                  Laura, when I saw it wasâ€”â€”"</p>
               <p>"My father!" shrieked she.</p>
               <p>"You have said it," added he, as calmly as possible, "It was your own father,
                  Laura!"</p>
               <p>"Henry!" exclaimed she, suddenly checking, or seeming to check, the violence of
                  her excitement, and looking up with steadiness while a tear swam in each eye of
                  blue.</p>
               <p>He looked down upon her with a conscious change in the current of his feelings,
                  but was able to utter no reply.</p>
               <p>"How <emph>could</emph> you do it!" she said. "How <emph>could</emph> you assist
                  in throwing my own father into prison! Did you forget <emph>me,</emph> then, in
                  that moment? Did you forget that you was capturing the father of her who wasâ€”"</p>
               <p>"Laura! For heaven's sake, Laura!" he replied, his heart wrought to an agony that
                  was quite as inexplicable as it was difficult to bear.</p>
               <p>She remained silent, willing to listen to such justification of his conduct as he
                  might be disposed to make.</p>
               <p>"You do not understand me, Laura," said he. "I did not offer myself to go and
                  assist in the capture of your father; far from it. I was <emph>ordered</emph> to
                  do so, Laura, and it of course at once became my duty to go. I was a soldierâ€”a
                  volunteer in the cause that you and I have so long loved together. I placed myself
                  by that single act in an attitude of obedience to whatever commands might ever be
                  issued. How could I do less than I have unfortunately done? How could I have
                  refused the most trifling obedience as a soldier? Noâ€”I <emph>could not!</emph> You
                  will forgive me, I hope, Laura, for that I have done; but in my present situation,
                  if the same order should overtake me again, much as I know I love you, I should
                  feel obliged to obey it as literally as I have already done in this instance."</p>
               <p>"Enough, Henry, enough! I can easily see how trying a soldier's lot may be,
                  especially when he enlists in a cause so seemingly desperate as that of the
                  Americans. I bear you no hard feeling for what you have done; indeed, I hardly see
                  how you could have done otherwise. You certainly could not. I can imagine it, was
                  a trial to you, but you could have done your duty none the less for all that."</p>
               <p>"Lauraâ€”my dear Laura!" exclaimed he, clasping her tenderly to his bosom, and
                  impressing a fervid kiss upon her forehead. "I feel that you are yet all my
                  own!"</p>
               <p>The maiden made no reply, but continued with her head still reclining upon his
                  shoulder. Occasionally she fetched a deep, long breath, attesting that her heart
                  was wholly engrossed in what had been said to her.</p>
               <p>"How long," asked she, suddenly springing up,â€”"how long did you say it would be
                  before my father is released."</p>
               <p>"In ten days."</p>
               <p>"Ten days! Oh, my poor, poor father! I would not have foreseen this for a whole
                  world's value! It is almost as much as I can bear."</p>
               <p>"It is more, Laura," he replied, "much more than I had ever expected, much less
                  hoped, to become a participator in. But the fortunes of war properly carry a
                  person into every kind of embarrassment as well as danger. None of us
                  soldiersâ€”young or oldâ€”can tell what lies before us. As I have already told you, we
                  have learned but one rule, and that isâ€”obedience. It is a soldier's disgrace, and
                  his positive ruin afterwards, if he refuse to obey the orders that he receives.
                  But let us drop this mournful subject, Laura, if it be possible, from our
                  thoughtsâ€”"</p>
               <p>"I wish it <emph>were</emph> possible, Henry!" interrupted she, with a sudden
                  outburst of feeling.</p>
               <p>"And so do I. But we must try to. It will do us no good to continually brood over
                  it, and it had much better be banished from our minds altogether. All that can be
                  done is to quietly await the hour when your father will be restored to you. It
                  will not be long coming, and patience is a good virtue to possess one's self of.
                  Meantime, I will procure leave to be absent from my post each evening during your
                  parent's imprisonment, and the whole of the time shall be given up to your
                  company. I shall hope to drive away in some measure the sadness that I see is
                  predisposed to settle down upon your spirits."</p>
               <p>"You will have a wonderful influence in doing it, too," replied she, gazing
                  lovingly up into his face.</p>
               <p>To a compliment so flatteringly paid, it was not in the young man's power to reply
                  in ordinary and set phrases. Accordingly, he only pressed his betrothed more
                  closely to his breast, and ventured upon a liberty with her rich ripe-red lips
                  which his very embarrassment and haste proved to be by no means a common practice
                  with him.</p>
               <p>The remainder of the eveningâ€”that is, what still remained to it of the youthful
                  soldierâ€”was passed in the enjoyment of conversation of a general character,
                  intermixed with the usual episodes that were sometimes their pleasant
                  peculiarities. Henry at length rose to take his leave, promising, if circumstances
                  were favorable, to be back again by the side of Laura on the ensuing evening.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE WITCHâ€”BET MIEFLES</head>
               <p>IN the extreme north of the county of Westchester, and bordering closely upon the
                  town of Ridgfieldâ€”if not quite within its boundariesâ€”in Connecticut there lived,
                  all through the days of the revolution, an old woman, named Bet Miffles. She was a
                  complete hermitess, inhabiting a solitary cave, or a hut, built conveniently about
                  the same, and subsisting only upon what a trifling and exceedingly meagre patch of
                  a garden, or the bountifulness of the woods, afforded her.<ref rend="super"
                     target="#note_004" xml:id="return_004">*</ref></p>

               <note place="foot" xml:id="note_004">
                  <p><ref target="#return_004">*</ref>This is no fiction, but a historical fact.</p>
               </note>
               <p>Her unique and lonely-looking habitation was located on the side of one of the
                  high hills, or ridges that everywhere abound in that quarter, from whose door was
                  to be bad at all times of the day a beautiful and truly picturesque view of the
                  surrounding country. The rock afforded a natural cavity for protection against the
                  inclemency of the weatherâ€”whether in the warm or the cold seasonsâ€”and upon and
                  about this had been built the rude temporary shelter or which we will attempt but
                  a partial description.</p>
               <p>Stiff and stout poles, notched at their upper extremities, held up others that
                  served in the capacity of cross-beams, upon which in turn was laid sufficient
                  brush, boughs, and boards, their chinks and crevices carefully plastered up with
                  moistened clay, to afford abundant protection under the visitation of any of the
                  elements save fire. The sides of the hut were carefully boarded up, and every
                  chink sedulously concealed. The door opened in about the middle of the front of
                  the habitation, and on each side of it, at proper distances from the ground, room
                  had been reserved for rough windows; rough, indeed, but none the less useful in
                  inclement weather, when the door must be closed, for all that.</p>
               <p>Where the cavity in the solid rock admitted it, a primitive fire-place had been
                  formed, by placing two stones of a broad base and sufficient height opposite each
                  other, in the fashion of and irons; while sundry well-smoked and seasoned pegs of
                  hard hickory, stuck into the interstices of the rock at different elevations from
                  the fire, served every purpose of crane and hooks that those identical articles
                  themselves could have well done. The smoke was suffered to escape in the crevices
                  already blackened and besooted with its steady passage upwards for a long
                  period.</p>
               <p>In the part of the hut in which was this cavity in the rock spoken of, was the
                  kitchen. Here stood the utensils common to the duties of even the most regardless
                  housewife, ranged around against the rock and the partition in tolerably
                  respectable order. In a distant corner was placed a low cotâ€”the sleeping-place of
                  old Bet Miffles herself. Near the middle of the kitchen stood, upon two whole legs
                  and one temporary supplied one, a round table, of exceedingly ancient manufacture,
                  as well as of a decidedly unique appearance. There was a small, plain cupboard
                  standing under the high window in the room, in which might have been seen, on
                  every occasion when she opened its door, a goodly row of burnished tin-ware, as
                  well as the number of cups, plates and saucers, which were requisite for her small
                  family's use. An old and somewhat clumsy arm chair, together with one considerably
                  shorter and lower, constituted the only movable seats there were in the apartment,
                  unless, perchance a short bench that never <emph>was</emph> moved from its
                  position against the wall, be reckoned in with them.</p>
               <p>The floor was without the merest vestige of a carpet, and left abundant
                  opportunity to the old woman to exercise her habits of tidiness and good order. In
                  the corner opposite her bed stood an old-fashioned clock, reaching very nearly to
                  the boarded ceiling of<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6939-00000010"/> the room. Upon its
                  face was the slowly but steadily accumulated dust of long years, already forming a
                  coating sufficiently thick and heavy in many places to have allowed the tracing of
                  letters upon and through it. The face was an odd and fanciful one, too; with two
                  large and long eyes cut in its forehead, as if it must needs take a survey of
                  every thing going on through them. Its hands were simply long and slim indices,
                  steadily pointing to the hour that was gone forever. There were two posts, or
                  pillars, whose quaintly carved peaks, once gilded, still stood sentry over the
                  ancient time-keeper, and between which ran a carved screen or fence on the front
                  side. The steady and monotonous tickings of this old clock sometimes caused the
                  silenceâ€”a silence almost as of death itselfâ€”to become painfully apparent; even
                  more so than if it had been altogether uninterrupted. All day long came that
                  steady clickâ€”click, as the huge pendulum swung to and fro in its long box of a
                  prison house. Perhaps in the summer days it was a pleasanter sound. It suggested
                  quiet, and unmolested seclusion, and holy privacy. It made one feel that the place
                  was one removed far from the crowding, and shouting, and jostling of the driving
                  worldâ€”that its Babel noises could not reach quite thus far up the mountain side.
                  As the fragrance came breathing into the apartment from distant banks and beds of
                  wild flowers, and the gentle winds just danced and pirouetted across the hard
                  oaken floor, there was a strange, yet satisfactory companionship in the continuous
                  ticking of the old clock, which would have really been needed, had they not been
                  heard, to make the dream one of a perfect pleasure.</p>
               <p>On the other side of the door, the entire remainder of the hut was carefully
                  partitioned off from observation. The part of the building devoted to it was,
                  after all, only the wing of the same, forming a snug and convenient little
                  apartment. The door of this little room was opened for the greater part of the
                  time in mild weather, and the casual visiter was greatly assisted in this manner
                  in taking an ocular inventory of its contents.</p>
               <p>There was a neat little bed in the corner of the room farthest from the window,
                  whose counterpane vied in whiteness with the driven snow. A small stand was placed
                  near the head of the bed, and upon it lay a Bible and three or four other books,
                  of an apparently miscellaneous character, that already attested to their having
                  been thoroughly thumbed and much more thoroughly used. There was a small chest of
                  drawers standing beneath the high window, into each one of which was securedâ€”not a
                  pair of highly polished rings, butâ€”a pair of smoothly-worn, brown-colored strings.
                  There was a small and not very clear mirror standing just above this, and fastened
                  at its top by a string to the wall. Just above the mirror itself was painted, with
                  all the art some ancient brush must have possessed, a huge blue rose, with
                  tulip-shaped leaves protruding from its stem, and a bunch of versi-colored petels
                  aspiring beyond its broad bosom. The floor, unlike that of the outer apartment,
                  had a carpet upon it, which, though it was much worn and more faded, seemed just
                  as well in that place as one of Turkish warp and woof would have done, to express
                  an idea of comparative ease and undeniable comfort.</p>
               <p>In pleasant weather, there might be seen an old pitcher, whose nose and handle had
                  long been broken off, filled with the freshest wild-flowers and trailing vines
                  that grew, whose fragrance completely filled the little apartment. No one had ever
                  seen the bed in a tumbled and disordered state; and yet there could be no doubt
                  that some one tenanted that room as much and as regularly as the outer one. There
                  were the evidences of a refined life within it every day. They were to be seen in
                  that broken pitcher of fresh and fragrant flowers; in the care with which every
                  wrinkle and tumble in the snow white counterpane was smoothed out; in the
                  diligence that kept the well-worn carpet free from any and every symptom of
                  carelessness or want of tidy labor; in the very thumb marks so deeply stained upon
                  the leaves of the books, not excepting in especial the Bible itself.</p>
               <p>Old Bet Miffles, who was the well-known proprietor of this strangely located
                  habitation, was a person of quite sixty years; perhaps even more; certainly more,
                  rather than less. Her figure was tall, lean and lank. It was slightly curved with
                  the united weight of cares and increasing years, yet not sufficiently so, by any
                  means, to deceive one in that appearance of perfect agility which she seemed to
                  possess as one of her individual characteristics. Her face was long, sharp, and
                  peaked at the chin, about which latter feature there grew two or three hair moles
                  of various colors and sizes. Her cheeks were somewhat sunken; and as her skin
                  scarcely sufficed to cover her features, it may be a certainly that the furrows in
                  her cheeks looked intensely repulsive. Her forehead was high and narrow, breetling
                  over a pair of very small and very gray eyes, like some cliff over the diminutive
                  and almost unseen entrances to a cavern. A pair of eyebrows overshadowed the
                  latter, that were exceedingly bushy and entangled for one of her sex, and added an
                  almost ferocious look to her countenance. Her mouth was small and well shaped. Her
                  nose, slightly inclined to a beak, yet just passing off into an acute angle.</p>
               <p>Upon her head she wore a cap that had long been there, once, perhaps, white, but
                  now of a color altogether incomprehensible. The strings to the same were long
                  since gone, and even the lower lobes of it were mutilated into shapeless shreds;
                  still, she continued wearing the cap upon her crown, apparently ignorant that it
                  poorly served to conceal those broad ribbons of silver that had long since been
                  intertwined and intertwisted by Time within her once dark and glossy locks. Over
                  each temple her hair was parted with exact care and brushed smoothly away; thus
                  leaving no part of a countenance capable ble of so many, and, at times, such
                  undefinable expressions, to suffer for want of a fair, and candid, and legible
                  exposure.</p>
               <p>As Bet Miffles walked about her habitation, in the performance of her regular
                  household duties, her figure best exhibited its several characteristics to the
                  truest advantage. Sometimes she forgot her troublesâ€”whatever they wereâ€”or her
                  experiencesâ€”whatever they had beenâ€”and quite straitened her form to woman's
                  dimensions. At such moments she showed herself a lithe and rather graceful
                  personage, capable of almost any movement not absolutely inconsistent with her
                  years. Sometimes she hurried to and from her cupboard in the farther part of the
                  room, stooping down to remove or set aside the various dishes of which it formed
                  the proper receptacle; and at such times she betrayed the natural gifts of a smart
                  and provident housewife. She went about her work with unheard words and
                  sentencesâ€”many believed them to be imprecationsâ€”between her lips; dropping one and
                  another at times, as occasion seemed to offer or demand, yet constantly seeming to
                  keep her counsel entirely to herself, as if what she happened to say either had
                  not been said, or absolutely meant just nothing at all.</p>
               <p>As a constant companion to the old woman, there lived with her an enormous black
                  cat, with fiery-fierce eyes of enormous proportions, and a coat of fur of enormous
                  thickness. The creature really seemed endowed with an intelligence far superior to
                  that of ordinary animals, and perhaps quite equal to that of which some few
                  mortals are barely allowed to make their boast. Whether, at any rate, she
                  understood general subjects as thoroughly as human beings may some of them be said
                  to, it lies not in our power as a narrator to satisfy the reader; but we well
                  enough know, for we have abundant reason for it, that she comprehended every word,
                  deed and movement of her mistress, old Bet Miffles, as if she had been a human
                  being herself; nay, even better. Betty had but to point to a particular object,
                  and the cat's glowing eyes were upon it in a trice, watching it as vigorously, and
                  twice as fiercely, as she.</p>
               <p>Wherever the old hermitess went, whether just around the hut, or across the little
                  plain before it, or far within the forest beyond it, the black cat was sure to
                  follow. The people in the distant village who were well acquainted with this
                  strange being, used to call her a witch; and averred that this huge black cat was
                  no other than the devil's own wicked self. Several of them had, on various
                  occasions, suddenly vacated the premises, and so greatly abridged a long-planned
                  visit of investigation and inquiry at the hut, as soon as they saw this creature
                  fastening her huge eyeballs, flaming with an unearthly rage, upon them. They said
                  that Bet Miffles always always kept company with the devil; and this statement was
                  in no manner weakened by their invariably seeing this cat walking either at her
                  side, or just before or behind her, wherever she went. Moreover, they
                  pertinaciously insisted that she was a witchâ€”a co-worker with unseen and terribly
                  wicked spirits of the airâ€”and that her deeds could be no other than evil. The
                  village of which we speak, could be distinctly seen, in clear weather, from the
                  door of the hut, or from just before it, although it was quite a three miles' walk
                  by the mountain path; and old Betty seemed to delight, at particular times, in
                  sitting down upon a rude bench before the door and gazing off upon it.</p>
               <p>The scene far and near, in summer, was charming. On the right waved an eternal
                  forest; dark with its gloomy green; running like a strong army of men up
                  precipitious ridges and mountain-sides; and raising its huge outhanging banners
                  from lofty spires, or gaped and flashed into innumerable ravines by the
                  uncontrollable power of the elements. Looking towards the left, the hill seemed
                  suddenly lost, as it was jaggedly rounded, to the eye; and of a sudden, long
                  vistas of pleasant meadows, where but few and straggling trees grew, presented
                  themselves with all their coverings of the greenest verdure. There were few or
                  none of those almost interminable stone walls laid in that day, as they are now
                  laid in that and other portions of New England, and in consequence the
                  pleasantness and harmony of the view was unbroken. Occasionally there were to be
                  seen patches and small fields of grain, either just raising its promises to the
                  weary husbandman's eves, or already bending under its load of profit; and where
                  the yellow corn peeped out from the dry husks that sought still to conceal it in
                  the autumn time, there were just faintly-visible streaks of yellowest goldâ€”the
                  real gold, too, from the most reliable mine, to his hands who tills the bosom of
                  the earth.</p>
               <p>The view was, at times, wonderfully distinct from this hut for miles and miles
                  away. Betty averred that she could descry even the distant waters of the Sound,
                  when there were no land fogs from the mear dows below her to interpose, and there
                  can be but little question, after all, that what she said was perfectly true. At
                  any rate, she was accustomed to sit and look watchfully in that direction,
                  sometimes by the long hours together. Could it be that <emph>she</emph> waited for
                  the arrival of any one?</p>
               <p>Living with this old heamitessâ€”this strange being that seemed unaccountable to any
                  code either of law or morality in existence, was a young girl named Mary. She was
                  a being of singular beauty, more especially when viewed in this rough and wild
                  seclusion, and in immediate contrast with the old hag who supported her. She
                  appeared perfectly satisfied with living where she did, never deeming it a
                  deprivation to her of a single one of those comforts and trifling amenities of
                  life, without which so many of us would be uncomfortable and unhappy.</p>
               <p>Let us briefly describe her:</p>
               <p>She had been fanned by the breezes of some seventeen or eighteen summers, and her
                  cheeks were still as clear as alabaster. There was but little color naturally in
                  them; but what little there was, was visibly heightened whenever sufficient
                  occasion occurred to produce that effect. Her head was well formed,<pb n="20-21"
                     xml:id="VAC6939-00000011"/> and covered with hair of a jet blackness, which she
                  carefully brushed and smoothed away, each morning, from her well developed
                  temples. Her forehead was rather low than otherwise, yet it lacked no mark of
                  intelligence, neither did it do despite to a face that was full to crowding with
                  every mark of the sweetest intellectuality. That face was fresh and fair, as how
                  could it be otherwise: discovering in all its features a perfect harmony in nature
                  with every principle of beauty and grace. Withal, at timesâ€”but those times did not
                  come <emph>very</emph> oftenâ€”a saddened expression stole over her countenance,
                  leading one to imagine that her young heart was even then brooding over wrongs
                  that she could in no wise mitigate or escape from; and then this transient cloud
                  would be chased away and altogether dissolved by a gleam of sunshine, so clear,
                  and so altogether golden, that it diffused its radiant influence all about her,
                  and made others comparatively happy by a sort of contagion.</p>
               <p>She was always dressed with the most studied simplicity, as she was obliged,
                  indeed, to dress herself. Her hair was invariably glossy and smooth. Her face was
                  always wreathed with irresistible smiles. Her person never looked other than tidy
                  and attractive; and there was an innate and unconscious grace about it that was
                  sufficient to charm the most casual beholder. It had alreadyâ€”that same lightsome
                  and airy personâ€”won the hearts of more than one of the young men in the distant
                  village.</p>
               <p>Knowing no other name by which to denominate the old witch, she always had called
                  her "grandmother." Her grandmother she might have been, too, for all that we could
                  now bring forward to shake the strength of such a relationship, or even dispute
                  allâ€”and that was muchâ€”which was talked round by those who knew both the
                  individuals; but there was a wild strangeness in the contrast the one afforded to
                  the other. It was like the sight of a blushing and dewy flower in the remorseless
                  folds of a hideous serpent!â€”or growing unprotected upon the brink of a dark and
                  fathomless cavern! We do not say that such <emph>was</emph> the truth in relation
                  to the two; but the sight of them suggested just such thoughts and unpleasant
                  comparisons in the minds of the good people of that day.</p>
               <p>Persons in the distant village often circulated with remarkable briskness and
                  energy the inquiry, whether there could be any right in the world that would at
                  low that old witch to confine that sweet young girl up in those mountain
                  fastnesses; and parties of the more determined and valiant ones had repeatedly
                  been formed for the purpose of scaling the high precipice that intervened, and
                  rescuing her from the injuries which they insisted on imagining she suffered. But,
                  nevertheless, no such expeditions were ever undertaken, and this wild flower of
                  the mountain-side was permitted to remain undisturbed in her dreamy solitude.</p>
               <p>The reader has undoubtedly guessed already that the other partitioned room in the
                  hut of old Betty was occupied by the youthful Mary. Such was really the case. It
                  was her soft hand that smoothed out the wrinkles in the counterpane, and fed the
                  old broken-nosed pitcher with the rarest flowers of the woods. It was her spirit
                  that diffused such a charming sense of tidiness around the entire apartment;
                  discovering itself as much in the manner in which the furniture in the room was
                  arranged, as in the very charms that swarmed about her matchless features.</p>
               <p>It was a custom of the girl, too, when her grandmother had absented herself long,
                  to sit upon the brow of that fearful precipice that yawned but ten or a dozen rods
                  before their door, and from that dizzy height to view the constantly changing
                  landscape, as the sun glanced over distant meadows, and fields, and hills; or
                  watch with eager eye the almost unrivaled phantasmagoric views that sailed into
                  her vision from the far-off waters of Long Island Sound. She would sometimes sit
                  there so long that she might have been thought asleep and dreaming; so rapt were
                  all her senses with the thousand natural charms that presented themselves to her
                  through her eye alone.</p>

               <head type="sub">A VISIT TO THE MOUNTAIN.</head>
               <p>FULL a mile away from this wild residence of the child and her grandmother, and
                  deeply in the inner and almost impenetrable recesses of the forest, was built a
                  rude cabin. Its component parts were chiefly boards, stones, and logs, and over
                  all was thrown a sufficient quantity of boughs of oak and pine to conceal the
                  place altogether from the view.</p>
               <p>This cabin was simply a log house, fashioned as the rudest of such habitations
                  are, and affording a meagre light by only a single window that was ordinarily
                  protected with a close shutter. It stood just beneath a high ledge, the better to
                  give it the appearance of a rock itself, for the purpose of concealment. No
                  visible path betrayed the existence of such a hiding place in that locality, every
                  imaginable access to that same being strewn with dried leaves, and roughly paved
                  with fragments of rock. One, in passing, would scarcely be able to detect the most
                  unusual appearance in that quarter, even upon the closest personal inspection; so
                  guarded were all the avenues, so carefully were the boughs strewn about its
                  entrance, and so much like a very part of the ledge itself did the hut appear. It
                  was evidently the work of an ingenious person, much accustomed to life in the
                  woods. People would need to go very near it in their passage from the hut of the
                  hermitess to the northern road, or cart-path, that, if properly followed,
                  invariably brought the traveler to the low land upon whose broad bosom was built
                  the little village we have spoken of.</p>
               <p>One afternoon in June, in the year 1776, a young man walked up from the
                  neighborhood of the village in question, apparently for the purpose of indulging
                  in the pastime of gaming. He carried a gun in his hand, and a leathern pouch was
                  slung across his shoulders. His dress was altogether careless and unstudied. His
                  boots were drawn up over his pantaloons, as if to protect them from the wear and
                  tear of the brush, as well as possibly from water in wading, and his hunting coat
                  seemed made for just such an excursion as he proposed.</p>
               <p>It was quite the middle of the afternoon when he reached the hut of the old woman,
                  which he approached with a cautions step and a listening ear. He at length stood
                  boldly before the door, and looked in. No person met his gaze. He knocked with his
                  knuckles upon the rough lintel, and awaited a reply; but none came. A second time
                  he knocked; still no summons from within.</p>
               <p>"Can the old hag have carried her off with her?" were the words that involuntarily
                  passed his lips.</p>
               <p>He continued standing in the position he had first taken before the door, for some
                  moments, apparently engaged in deep thought. Then he suddenly broke away from the
                  same, and turned to take his departure with a clouded brow.</p>
               <p>What was his surprise, however, and how much more was his joy, to observe the
                  figure of the young girl approaching from the opposite direction. She had been
                  rambling down the declivity, in quest of her usual afternoon's adventure.</p>
               <p>"My dear Mary!" exclaimed he, moving quickly towards her and encircling her waist
                  with his arm.</p>
               <p>She turned upon his fine countenance a look of love and gratitude combined, but
                  her lips uttered no syllables. The moved; but their soft murmurs were inaudible,
                  though not unintelligible to him.</p>
               <p>"Are you alone this afternoon?" ventured he.</p>
               <p>"Grandmother has been gone since morning," she replied.</p>
               <p>"And doesn't she inform you where she is going, Mary, when she leaves you in this
                  place by yourself for so long a long a time. I declare, it's absolutely dangerous.
                  There are enemies about, and no scarcity of them either. It would not be safe that
                  any such should know of your being unprotected up here."</p>
               <p>The girl blushed deeply at this profession of his regard for her, and as she
                  yielded to his gentle guidance of her person towards the hut, she said in a low
                  and sweet voice:</p>
               <p>"I'm not afraid, William."</p>
               <p>"That's not the thing, child! Afraid, or not afraid, it's her duty, if she is a
                  grandmother of yours, to see that you are not exposed to the ruthless and wanton
                  insults of such scapegraces as the country just at this time happens to
                  afford"</p>
               <p>"But I never have been harmed, William," she protested mildly.</p>
               <p>"And that is no reason at all why you may not be," replied he, seating himself
                  beside her upon the bench, and fondly taking one of her fair hands within both his
                  own. "These are troublesome times, Mary," he continued; "we do not know what
                  dangers are lurking about us. It is difficult to determine even who are the
                  friends, and who the foes, of their country; though, I acknowledge, that the
                  latter are found with greater difficulty than the former. Sometimes they are
                  impressed with a sense of shame, and sometimes of fear; and under such
                  impressions, they are somewhat chary in making known their prejudices and
                  preferences to the public. But the truth must sooner or later come out; men cannot
                  long disguise their sentiments on the subject of this war, for it is one that
                  brings itself too closely home to their hearts and hearths. It isn't, however,
                  from respectable dissentients to the cause of liberty that I should fear any wrong
                  to you in this out-of-the-way place; it is from those lawless, renegade, vagabond
                  fellows, who, under the avowed cover of the name of toryâ€”a name I loathe
                  sufficiently alreadyâ€”commit every act included in the term lawlessness, and swear
                  it all subserves the cause of the king."</p>
               <p>"Why am I not quite as safe here, William, as you are in the army?" asked the
                  maiden, looking up and seeming to imagine she had the better of the argument.</p>
               <p>"I am safe everywhere, and I am in danger everywhere," replied he, with
                  earnestness. "My <emph>duty</emph> calls me to a post of danger; while your duty
                  as plainly points you to a place of as great comparative safety as possible."</p>
               <p>"Does it, William?"</p>
               <p>"Does it! Does it <emph>not,</emph> Mary? Woman is for the fireside and the
                  heart-chambers. She was never formed and never educated for the field, or the
                  rough experiences of life; these are for <emph>men?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"But I would expose myself equally with you, William."</p>
               <p>"Forbid the thought, high heaven!" fervently ejaculated he. "If breasts are to be
                  bared in this unnatural contest, at least let them be the more hardy breasts of
                     <emph>men!</emph> Mary, you wrong your sex when you propose to put yourself in
                  a place of peril. You had better come down to the village, and there make your
                  home until the war is over. My uncle will be left all alone with his good
                  housekeeper, after I am gone, and there will be no telling what choice company you
                  will be for him. Come, Mary; say that you will go!"</p>
               <p>"And leave my grandmother?"</p>
               <p>"Maryâ€”Mary," said he, lowering his voice quite perceptibly, and drawing still
                  nearer to her sideâ€”"I do not believe she is your grandmother!"</p>
               <p>The girl had never chanced to hear the suggestion from any one's lips before, and
                  it startled her.</p>
               <p>"Why do you not think she is?" she turned and inquired, with a look of the most
                  perfect innocence.</p>
               <p>"She <emph>can't</emph> be! Noâ€”she <emph>can't</emph> be! I cannot tell you why;
                  but I have always had an undefinable feeling towards her that I could not purge
                  myself of. Besides, she doesn't possess a single feature that you do."</p>
               <p>"But she is so much older!â€”she is my own <emph>grandmother,</emph> too!"</p>
               <p>"Fudge! I cannot believe it."</p>
               <p>"And she treats me well."</p>
               <p>"Yes, in her <emph>way;</emph> but that way has no <emph>affection</emph> in it.
                  If she were really your relative, my dear Mary, think you she would go off in the
                  morning, and leave<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6939-00000012"/> you to protect
                  yourself in this mountain eyrie until night again?"</p>
               <p>"But how could <emph>she</emph> protect me any the more for being here herself,
                  William? She is old, and she is weak. She has not so much power in her hands as I
                  have, to defend us both."</p>
               <p>"You!" exclaimed the young lover playfully, the while fondling with her delicate
                  hand and observing its soft texture, as the best marginal note by which to read
                  the real meaning of the sentence she had uttered</p>
               <p>"And why not I, as well as she?"</p>
               <p>"Child! child!"</p>
               <p>The maiden hung her head, while the crimson mounted to her cheeks, and thence even
                  to her temples.</p>
               <p>"Now I wish you would give me your word, Mary," continued he, after a brief pause,
                  "that you will accept the protection and hospitality which my uncle's house
                  affords. Will you not?"</p>
               <p>"And leave grandmother, as I asked before?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied he, after some hesitation.</p>
               <p>"I could not do that"</p>
               <p>"Then have her accompany you."</p>
               <p>"And that she would never do. I had better not think of it, than of taking her
                  along."</p>
               <p>"But I shall probably be called back to my regiment very shortly, and how can I go
                  until I am assured of your safety?"</p>
               <p>"Think not of it," replied she.</p>
               <p>"Then I cease to live! Mary, you do not yet know the depth of my heart!"</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, but I spoke thoughtlessly. I was careless."</p>
               <p>"You are readily forgiven," replied he; "yet that act of mine does not determine
                  my happiness and quiet any the more closely. I wish you would go with meâ€”go at
                  once!"</p>
               <p>Their further conversation was suddenly cut off by the appearance of old Bet
                  Miffles herself. She was coming, at a slow and thoughtful pace, from the direction
                  of the forest, and her inseparable companion, the black cat, was walking just
                  before her, her tail at a right angle with her body, and both rubbing
                  affectionately against the dress of her old mistress</p>
               <p>The old witch drew near to them almost before they could have had a faint glimpse
                  of her coming; and the young man began to fear that she might have overheard the
                  latter part of his conversation, and would accordingly insure Mary against the
                  favorable chance of every project he might set on foot for providing her a place
                  of security. She passed by them, however, and be took herself into the house
                  without saying a word.</p>
               <p>She evidently was not unused to the sight with which her eyes had just been
                  regaled, and it seemed therefore nothing strange to the young couple that she
                  preserved the silence she did.</p>
               <p>Before long, the young man, William Howe, had stolen a long and ardent kiss from
                  the lips of his fair mistress, as they sat upon the oaken bench before the door,
                  and taken his sad departure. He threw many a hurried glance backward upon his
                  heart's treasure, looking as if it were quite a living death for him to separate
                  from her under such gloomy and unsatisfactory circumstances, and then had vanished
                  altogether from her straining view within the dark recesses of the forest.</p>
               <p>For at least a mile kept on his solitary way, his gun across his shoulder, busily
                  thinking upon the chances of his finding an order for him to repair to
                  head-quarters at the house of his uncle, and trying to devise some method by which
                  complete safety might be provided for Mary, while he should be obliged to be
                  absent from her. His thoughts evidently tended to no point like a satisfactory
                  one, for his countenance bore every symptom of unrest. Reaching at length a stump
                  that stood upon a little cleared spot, he stood his gun by his side, and sat
                  himself down to rest and contemplation.</p>
               <p>The hour was one peculiarly adapted to such an object, for the rays of the sun
                  came slantingly through the garniture of the trees, and wove themselves into
                  bright and golden figures upon the green earth-carpet at his feet. There they
                  danced and shimmered with each motion of the trees, like the ever-varying figures
                  one sees in a kaleidescope. There were the most fragrant breaths upon the air, and
                  they revived his sinking spirits. Anxious to draw in as much of their inspiration
                  as possible, and willing to have them visit him in their native freedom at every
                  quarter, he took off his cap and freely bared his temples and brow to them.</p>
               <p>For some time he sat as one in a trance. There was a power beyond and above that
                  of his own will, that controlled every thought of his soul, and even every muscle
                  of his face. He rested his head slightly upon his hand forgot entirely where he
                  was. Was there a sweet picture at that moment before his swimming eye? Was there
                  the form of a lovely maiden everywhere pervading and permeating that picture? Were
                  there clouds, big and threatening clouds beginning to let themselves down upon the
                  fair landscape, and promising soon to enshroud everything in their blackness? Saw
                  heâ€”mentallyâ€”no azure depths still beyond those threatening clouds; depths of blue
                  in which they had once sailed as a gauze-like mist, and out of which they had now
                  suddenly gathered themselves as for a cruel and furious onset? Yes! lightnings and
                  thunders came out of these clouds! The sound of that thunder made him dream of the
                  booming of far off cannon. Their indistinct flashes horrified him with the glare
                  of many battles. He kept looking at the vision before himâ€”looking steadily and
                  dreamily. He saw long streamers of fire and blood shooting athwart the horizon in
                  every direction. Every variety of serpent and vile creature that crawled and bred
                  was pursuing its strangely confused and intertwisted way across the sky. Then he
                  saw distinctly huge banners, and heard the roll of a hundred drums, calling upon
                  the hosts to rush forward and sustain them. The air was alive with the sweetest
                  melody, and the most harsh and grating discords. Still the numberless drums kept
                  on their rolling, and the thick heads of the gathering clouds kept up their roar.
                  Still the thousand reptiles kept going on their scaly bellies, and the broad
                  streamers, flaming with fire and deeply dyed in blood, kept shooting higher and
                  higher. Yet above and beyond all was that same field of azure skyâ€”that sure
                  anchorâ€”that abiding hopeâ€”that final resting-place for him, after every energy was
                  spent and every effort was thoroughly and hopefully made. He tried to interpret
                  the meaning of allâ€”what there was of it that was no mystery. He thought the
                  picture was that of his own hopes, and of the hopes of his own country. The array,
                  the music, the roar, the banners, the reptiles, the streamersâ€”all filled his mind
                  with indefinable terror; yet there lay a sure and strong hope for him beyond all.
                  That deep blue sky encouraged and inspirited him.</p>
               <p>While he yet sat in this position, these wild and incoherent fancies sailing
                  across his busied and excited brain, he heard the sudden and sharp crack of a
                  rifle. He had no time to seize his own gun that lay by his side. He had not even
                  time to turn himself partially round, to see what might be the cause of the
                  report. Almost at the same moment when the report struck his ear, he fell
                  senseless to the ground. He was not able to catch the sound of a musket, fired
                  almost simultaneously from a point not far distant from him.</p>
               <p>The next time he was conscious of anything, his head was lying in the lap of a
                  person near him, and he was gazing up into his face. The face was that of a negro,
                  who responded to the look of gratitude with:</p>
               <p>"Blessed glad you come back to life, Massa Billy! 'Fraid you was done for good!
                  That Injun's rifle not quite sure yit!"</p>
               <p>The young man motioned for him to narrate the particulars of the unexpected
                  occurrence, as near as they could be collected by him. In substance, he told him
                  as follows:</p>
               <p>The negro, whose name was Buff, and who had long lived in the family of the young
                  man's uncle, observing that he was making preparations to go into the woods for
                  game, and perhaps for another purpose with which he seemed in nowise unacquainted,
                  resolved secretly to follow him; for, said he to himself, "there's no telling what
                  help he <emph>may</emph> want before he gets back, and I might just as well be on
                  his track unbeknown to him." Accordingly, he followed on until he saw his young
                  master safely at the hut of the old witch. While he remained there in the company
                  of the girl, Buff was secreted in the edge of the forest, where he lay until the
                  young man took his departure. On his return, he continued following him, and stood
                  hidden from view behind a tree, while he was sitting upon the stump in the
                  clearing. While he gazed round in the wood, he thought he saw a figure slightly
                  moving not far from him. It was growing dusky, and he watched longer and more
                  patiently to satisfy himself what it was. What was his horror at length to observe
                  that the figure slowly raised a rifle to its shoulder and took deliberate aim at
                  the young man! Quicker almost than thought, Buff clapped his own musket to his
                  shoulder, took a hasty sight at the figure, and fired. But the other had fired
                  first. Buff stopped to see what service his gun had performed, when he saw the
                  lithe and dusky form of an Indian running away from his post of concealment.
                  Looking again towards his master, he observed that he had fallen to the ground
                  from his seat upon the stump, and still lay there insensible. He instantly sprang
                  towards him and raised him gently in his arms. Examining his wound, he found it
                  was nothing more than the graze of a bullet upon the left side of his headâ€”a
                  rather narrow escape, to be sureâ€”but a great ways preferable to being killed
                  outright by having the ball go <emph>through</emph> his head. He took his own
                  canteen, filled with water, from his shoulder, and bathed his temples and
                  moistened his lips until he revived him. It was then that he narrated to him the
                  manner in which this occurrence, approaching so very near to fatality, had
                  befallen him.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <head type="sub">A NOONDAY ENCAMPMENT.</head>
               <p>THREE men were encamped in a piece of wood in Westchester, a trifle above what so
                  soon afterwards came to be known by the name of the Neutral Ground. It was about
                  the middle of the forenoon, and they lay in a sort of intervale expressly adapted
                  to the purpose of concealment.</p>
               <p>Two of these men were dressed after the fashion of working-men, and were without
                  doubt specimens of the brave and hardy farmers of that day. They had their muskets
                  lying close by their sides, and the leather straps they had been wearing about
                  their waists, were relaxed to allow them the greater ease in their roving siesta.
                  Their countenances denoted characters of sterling good sense and irreproachable
                  honesty. Their limbs were specimens of muscular combinations, looking as if they
                  were jointed with rivets of iron. A third person sat by them, engaged in finishing
                  a meal upon which all had been busying themselves. His dress was fully as rough
                  and careless as that of the other two, and it was altogether more noticeable and
                  unique.</p>
               <p>He wore a deer-skin hunting cap upon his head, fitting it pretty closely, and yet
                  leaving well exposed the entire countenance. There was growing a shaggy beard upon
                  his face, which he had seemingly taken great pains to cultivate, for some special
                  purposes undoubtedly best known to himself. He wore skin leggins about his limbs,
                  that were laced up on their outer sides with well-cured strings of the same
                  material. Over his feet were drawn a pair of rather clumsy boots, that looked as
                  if he had chosen them as much for the purpose of slipping out of them easily in a
                  close pursuit as for downright rough-and-tumble wear. He likewise carried a rifle,
                  and, while he sat by the side of his companions, it rested against a young sapling
                  just at his hand.</p>
               <p>The individual himself was Verd-Antique.</p>
               <p>"Come, John!" spoke one of the men lying upon<pb n="24-25"
                     xml:id="VAC6939-00000013"/> the green moss-carpet; "finish your meal as soon 's
                  ye can, for I've got work cut out for ye afterwards."</p>
               <p>"And what mout <emph>that</emph> be?" questioned he.</p>
               <p>"You was in the battle o' Bunker Hill, nigh Borstun, warn't ye?"</p>
               <p>"I wasn't fur off, I kin tell ye," replied Verd-Antique, hurrying the remaining
                  morsels of his food into his capacious mouth, and putting them into a summary
                  process of mastication.</p>
               <p>"Wal, it's about that battle that I want ye to tell us a little, while we lay
                  here. Why not? There's nothin' else to do to-day, and an hour spent in gittin' a
                  leetle more acquainted with the way they fight in a reg'lar battle can't be an
                  hour hove awayâ€”not on <emph>me,</emph> it can't."</p>
               <p>Old Verd-Antique was soon through with every vestige of his morning repast; and,
                  removing his seat to a tuft of moss that looked a trifle greener and softer, he
                  ventured to begin:</p>
               <p>"If you'd really <emph>like</emph> to hear about it, why, I s'pose, I kin give you
                  most as much information as anybody about these parts."</p>
               <p>"Tell us, Johnâ€”tell us all you see!" called out both men at once, quite
                  earnestly.</p>
               <p>"Wal, then, here's what little I know'd and see o' that consid'able of a skrimmage
                  folks callâ€” <q>
                     <p>The Battle of Bunker Hill!</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Wal, you see, it's an occurrence sich as I can't specially give ye all the
                  pertiklers about, but sich as come under my own observation I'm purty apt to
                  remember; for 'twas a hot kind of a fight, and there was purty clost quarters for
                  us all.</p>
               <p>"Let me see; yes, it's jest a year ago this very day that we was all on us into
                  it. Only think of it! a year ago to-dayâ€”and as much hotter out there in the
                  brillin' sun than in here in this shade, as anybody could very well imagine. There
                  wan't no chance for folks to keep cool that dayâ€”not a bit of it. Everybody had to
                  stand and take his chance.</p>
               <p>"Let me seeâ€”where <emph>was</emph> I fightin'? But 'taint no very great matter
                  about <emph>where</emph> it was. I wa in some company o'Connecticut militia, and
                  you may depend that my old musket was as deep-loaded and sure-primed as any on
                  'em.</p>
               <p>"There'd been a good while that the soldiers'd got sort o'tired o'hangin' round
                  the camps, round in Cambridge, and Dorchester, and so on, and they begun to talk
                  up to the officers about having' a bit of a skrimmage with the red coats that were
                  in Boston. It kind o'made our country fellers' blood hot to hear that the cussed
                  British was a-doin' jest what they wanted to do in Boston, convertin' the churches
                  of God Almighty into stables and circus shows, and they wanted to git a grip onto
                  'em, if in any way they could. Wal, the head officers held meetins, and councils
                  o' war; and they agreed to a little of everything and a good deal o' nothin.'
                  Amongst all the rest on 'em. Old Put had <emph>his</emph> say. Says Gen'ral
                  Putnam, says he, 'Gentlemen officers, all I've got to say about the matter is
                  this: the soldiers want to go and fight the cussed British most orfully, and, for
                     <emph>my</emph> part, I'm willin' to led 'em a hand in doin' of it!'"</p>
               <p>"Good for Old Put!" shouted out one of the companions of Verd-Antique.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied he, "good for <emph>him,</emph> but 'twant half, nor
                     <emph>near</emph> so good as what he said right afterwards."</p>
               <p>"What was that?" asked the other.</p>
               <p>"Why, he said that our men would learn a kind of experience they wanted, in
                  riskin' a single important engagement with Gage's troops, and that the British
                  would git a trifle of an idee of what sort o' marksmen our folks was. Moreover, he
                  said that if our men fit behind entrenchments, they'd have a double advantage, and
                  would cover themselves with twice as much glory. Says the old man, says he, 'the
                  Americans aint a bit afraid o'their <emph>heads,</emph> though they're wonderful
                  afraid o' their <emph>legs;</emph> and if you only cover up their
                     <emph>legs,</emph> they'll fight for ever!' And a truer thing he never spoke,
                  even if he spoke it right out o' the Bible.</p>
               <p>"Wal, after a good deal o'parleyin' and palarverin', they all finally agreed to
                  have a brush with the red coats. We heard, you see, that they talked of comin' out
                  o' camp and occupyin' Dorchester Heights and Charlestown on the eighteenth, and so
                  our folks thought they'd jest be a little before 'em, and give 'em work of a
                  different kind to do. And old Gen'ral Ward, who commanded all the forces at the
                  camp in Cambridge, issued his orders to Colonel Prescott and others to get
                  themselves and their men ready for an expedition <emph>somewhere,</emph> and to
                  provide themselves with provisions for one day. This order was issued on the 16th
                  of Juneâ€”just a year ago yesterday, too.</p>
               <p>"On the evenin' of the 16thâ€”I remember it all jest as well as if 'twas only
                  yesterdayâ€”Colonel Prescott got orders to march to Charlestown, take possession of
                  Bunker Hill, and demand it the best way he could. The Colonel kept the whole plan
                  a secret from his men, and he set off on his job. Old Put had a sort o' general
                  supervision over the matter, and there was a famous engineer, too, Colonel
                  Gridley, that went along with us on the expedition. Not a single man of us knew
                  what was goin' to be done, though we all knew what we <emph>wanted.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"What was that?" interrupted one of the listeners.</p>
               <p>"What was that? We wanted to see <emph>fightin!</emph> That's all there was wanted
                  jest then, and we knew that it couldn't be very fur off, either. All of a sudden,
                  we had crossed over Charlestown Neck; and then we begun to see for ourselves.
                  There was all the wagons, piled up with tools of all sorts for making
                  entrenchments, and ready to go right along with us. The officers begun to order us
                  all to stack arms and begin the fortifications, when it was discovered that nobody
                  knew what spot in pertikler was to be fortified. There was two or three hills
                  before us, but for the sake o' savin' our souls from the army of General Gage,
                  there wasn't one of us that knew a name for any on 'em; all on'em was Bunker Hill
                  to us!</p>
               <p>"They had a consid'able, of a talk about what spot they'd take hold of, the
                  officers did amongst themselves, and the time was a-wearin' away, and it was
                  gittin' kinder tedious; and at last the engineer spurred up, and told 'em if they
                  was a-goin' to do <emph>any</emph> thing that night, they'd best begin purty soon
                  with it. This sorter started some on 'em, and after another long parley they
                  concluded to fortify the hill furthest down towards the British, and what we
                  afterwards found out was called Breed's Hill.</p>
               <p>"To work they went, all hands on 'em. The figger of the redoubt and the
                  breastworks was laid out by Colonel Gridley, and we had the picks and spades put
                  into our hands soon after. But 'twas a trifle past midnight before the first
                  shovelful of ground was hove up by one of us. But after we <emph>did</emph> git to
                  work about it, you may make up your minds that we worked jest as hard as men knew
                  how to, the rest of the night. Old Put had his cot off most all the time and his
                  sleeves stripped up, and there wasn't a man on the ground that would make the dirt
                  move faster than he did. I knew he must be an old head at farming, quick as I laid
                  eyes on him; and I didn't believe he had to use oxen to do quite all his plowin',
                  nuther. And Colonel Prescott, the brave old man, he was encouragin' us all the
                  time, and tellin' us 'put in boys! put in for it! the red coats will all go into
                  fits the minnit the sun rises and they see these entrenchments!' I tell you, we
                  had every kind of encouragement men needed to have about their work.</p>
               <p>"It was jest as clear starlight that night as ever you see in all your life.
                  Colonel Prescott begun bymeby to git a trifle squeamish for fear the British might
                  be able to see what was goin' on, for you see we wasn't but a short ways from
                  Copp's Hill and the Ferry, at the best. So what does Prescott to but take Major
                  Brooks along with him down to the shore, and go to work to reconnoitre 'em. There
                  wasn't no sound to be heard from 'em, however, thank Fortune! Everything was as
                  quiet as death itself, and death in a deep forest at midnight, too. They could
                  hear plain enough, thought, the enemy's sentry relievin' guard, and heard 'em cry
                  out 'All's well!' with a kind of pleasure they hadn't enjoyed before in a long
                  while.</p>
               <p>"Early the next mornin', while we were yet hard to work upon the breastwork, Old
                  Put started off for the camp to Cambridge, to get ready for the action that he
                  pretty shrewdly guessed wouldn't be long comin' on. He went to make some
                  arrangements, too, about relievin' his horse in the course o' the day, for he
                  wasn't no <emph>common</emph> rider, you'd better believe me! If <emph>he</emph>
                  rode a horse, the animal was pretty sure to find out there was <emph>a</emph> man
                  on his back! Colonel Prescott, he keeps thinkin' the enemy can't help seein' what
                  we'd done, and down he posts to the shore agin; but all was jest as quiet as
                  before.</p>
               <p>"Bymeby the great yaller sun begun to lift up his head above the hills over in the
                  east, and the gray of morning pretty soon turned into gold. It wasn't possible
                  that the thing could be kept from the British any longer. They rubber their eyes,
                  and looked through the mistâ€”or what they must ha' <emph>thort</emph> was a
                  mistâ€”and then I cal'late they begun to cuss I knowd they called us damned foxes
                  for what we done that night, and said we was a good deal better at our nat'ral
                  business, which was burrowin', that at fightin'. But, howsomever, perhaps they
                  found out a good deal more 'n that, afore they got through. There they saw us,
                  airly in the mornin', overlookin' 'em completely, and with entrenchments hove up
                  before us as would frighten the bravest sort o' soldiers. Bymeby, the cannon begun
                  to blaze away from one o'their vessels, and all Boston was purty much astonished
                  at wakin' up, to see what had been done in the short and warm night they'd been
                  sleepm' sound."</p>
               <p>"Enough to scare a hundred sick towns, I should think," rejoined one of the
                  men.</p>
               <p>"So I should think, too," exclaimed the other.</p>
               <p>"'Twasn't very long, though," continued the narrator, putting a fresh quid of
                  tobacco in his mouth by way of an introductionâ€”"'twasn't long, though, before they
                  opened on us from their battery on Copp's Hill, and from their floatin' batteries,
                  and frigates, and a man-o'-war they called the Somerset, right not and hearty. It
                  was purty ticklish for some o' the poor fellers that most on 'em never see cannon
                  fired before, and I looked round to see some o' the boys' cheeks turn a little
                  white; p'raps they did; but they stood to their places and their work like so many
                  veterans after all. The big balls come ploughin' and boundin' along where we were,
                  and sometimes they looked in the air as if they was goin' to crush and pound up
                  all on us into a mortarful of grissle and bones; you'd better think 'twas ticklish
                  a trifle!</p>
               <p>"Prescott was hard to work in the redoubt, and Old Put was everywhere else. The
                  moral truth is, there warn't no <emph>keepin'</emph> him in one spot! He wouldn't
                  stay <emph>nowhere!</emph> One poor fellow, who had got the other side o' the
                  works, was struck down of a sudden by a ball from the shipping. I see that man
                  fall myself. He was the first man that fell, too, on that day. He was n't far from
                  where I stood, and I remember how like death it come over me, to see them pesky
                  red coats causin' such a cruel ruin as that. The poor man never 'd harmed
                  themâ€”â€”"</p>
               <p>"But you can't say he wouldn't if he'd had a good <emph>chance?</emph>"
                  interrupted one of the deeply interested listeners.</p>
               <p>"No, but I <emph>can</emph> say most likely he <emph>would</emph> ha' done all the
                  hurt to 'em he could, if they'd but allowed his soul to say in his body a dozen
                  hours longer. But jest as soon 's he fell, the word begun to go down the line,
                  'there's man killed! there's man killed outside!" You may be sure there was a
                  freezin' terror that crept over every heart and frame there was on the ground.
                  None of 'emâ€”that is, the most of 'emâ€”never had seen a man killed in their midst
                  before, and it curdled their blood for 'em. They stopped their diggin', one and
                  another of 'em, and begun to crowd round the dead man to catch a sight of his
                  face. <emph>Then</emph> their cheeks turned pale enough, and one could see that
                  there was something like a wild fear settin' in on 'em, such as couldn't be got
                  rid of after it had got full control of 'em. Jest at this minnit, Old Put came
                  ridin' up on his great horse, and looked for<pb n="26-27"
                     xml:id="VAC6939-00000014"/> himself <emph>to</emph> see what was the matter. I
                  reck'n he had a fear for the effect 'twould have on the men, and he was all-ready
                  for such an emergency, as he always has been for all sorts of such things. 'Come,
                  my lads!' says Old Put, hollerin' up pretty strong, jest as if nothin' at all had
                  happenedâ€”and his good strong voice <emph>alone</emph> was as good as a glass o'
                  sperits and water to put courage into a manâ€”'come, my lads,' says Old Put, 'a half
                  dozen of you dig a grave and bury that man! such a sight'll be nothin' new to any
                  of you before nightfall!' Quicker than wink, the men who were ordered fell to
                  their duty, and the thing seemed to pass out of the minds of all of us in a very
                  few minnits.</p>
               <p>"Prescott, he was on top o' the redoubt works, and his old gray wig fell off, and
                  he kept wavin' his sword over the heads of his men, sometimes threatenin' to chop
                  'em up into mince-meat if they didn't put into it with more of a will, and
                  sometimes tellin' 'em how much like Trojuns they all were, and what good fellers
                  they were, and how much they'd enjoy the great victory they were goin' to have;
                  and then agin he'd tell 'em stories and anecdotes that would make the very tears
                  come into their eyes for laughter. "Twould n't have made any difference to them
                  whether he had on a wig or not; they'd know him jest as well without one, and
                  respect him a good deal more, too, because they know'd then that he was all
                  Prescott and no wig!</p>
               <p>"By ten and 'leven o'clock it got to be pretty hot, I can tell you. There we'd
                  been, working all night, with nothin' like water to drink, and what little
                  provisions we'd brought away with us from camp were about all gone. We were hot,
                  and tired 'most out. Some of the sub-officers proposed to Colonel Prescott to send
                  to the camp at Cambridge and bring a force to take our places. 'No, no!' cried the
                  old Colonel, 'these men raised these works, and they are the best qualified to
                  defend 'em! They've done all the laborâ€”now let 'em enjoy the victoryâ€”for a victory
                  'twill certainly be!' This was good enough to make us all feel a little
                  stouter-hearted, and I guess all hands made up their minds at once to stand till
                  they were drove off by the British.</p>
               <p>"'Twasn't long before we could see the state of things in Gen'ral Gage's camp in
                  Boston. We purty soon knew what they'd determined on doin'. Their companies were
                  marchin' about in the streets, and we could hear the rattlin' of the artillery
                  wagons and carriages, and everything was getting ready for a demonstration.
                  'Twould have done anybody good to hear Prescott holler out, jest at that minnit,
                  'Now, my boys, we shall have a fight; and <emph>we shall beat 'em, too!'</emph>
                  Prescott sent over to Gen'ral Ward at Cambridge for refreshments and more men, at
                  that time, but 'twas a long time before they come, though.</p>
               <p>"And Warren come there amongst us, that last forenoon of his life, too. He'd been
                  out to Water-town, to preside over the doins of the congress that was met there,
                  and come into Cambridge only that mornin'. He got there at Cambridge about
                  daylight and sayin' that he was sick with the headache, threw himself down on the
                  bed. But jest as soon as Gen'ral Ward sent to his room to tell him that the
                  British were comin' out o' Boston to fight us on Bunker Hill, he jumped off o' the
                  bed and said his headache was all gone. Purty soon he mounted his horse and come
                  gallopin' across the neck over to where we were.</p>
               <p>"It was about one o'clock, and jest a year ago to-day, and as much hotter, too, as
                  you could imagine and not die, when the British troops landed at a spot in
                  Charlestown they call Morton's Point. They halted here for some time, and purty
                  soon they had a fresh arrival of men. While they were landin' and gettin'
                  themselves ready to be shot at in the best order they knew, Old Put ordered
                  Colonel Knowlton, as brave an officer as ever <emph>anybody</emph> see, and to
                  whose corps I belonged that day, to git behind a rail fence that run across from
                  the road to the Mystic River. There was an orchard in front of this fence, and
                  another behind it. We set to work to pullin' up the fences of both of 'em, and
                  stackin' 'em up near the one we were ordered to. There was some grass fresh mowed
                  near by, and so we took that and stowed it in between the three fences. To be
                  sure, it wouldn't be expected to <emph>defend</emph> us no great, but it
                     <emph>looked</emph> like a breastwork, and that was something, you know.</p>
               <p>"Old Put about this time rode back across Charlestown Neck to Cambridge, where the
                  fire of chain, and round, and bar shot raked the whole of it. He rode jest as it
                  he was ridin' for life and death. I never did <emph>see</emph> a man use a horse
                  so thoroughly. But for all of their firin', never a ball struck him nor harmed a
                  hair of his blessed old head.</p>
               <p>"Purty soon the British reg'lars begun to march up towards us. They was all
                  dressed out in their gay uniforms, and they marched to the liveliest kind of music
                  a soldier ever stepped to. All the heights back of us were covered with Americans,
                  lookin' on so anxious and impatient to know what was goin' to be the fate of their
                  friends and their country. All the steeples, and houses, and hills in Boston were
                  covered, too; and many a poor woman looked through her tears that day; not knowin'
                  but she might be a widder before night, and her home thousand dreary miles across
                  the water! It was such a sight as I say I never see the like of before; and it's a
                  good deal of a question whether I shall ever see such a one agin!"</p>
               <p>"So I should have thought!" one of his companions could not avoid interrupting. "I
                  never laid <emph>my</emph> eyes on sich a one!"</p>
               <p>"No, nor I either," rejoined the other.</p>
               <p>"But I b'lieve I could ha' <emph>fit</emph> then, if <emph>ever</emph> I could,"
                  added the first speaker.</p>
               <p>"And who, in the name of Ameriky and all that's holy, <emph>couldn't?</emph>"
                  replied old Verd-Antique. "But," continued he, "a feller didn't find much time to
                  stop and look round, at sich a time as that. The cannon begun to boom off towards
                  Roxbury, off at the t'other part of the city; and what with the noise the cannon
                  they were firin' at <emph>us</emph> made, there was a good deal o' music in our
                  ears sich as 'twas.</p>
               <p>"The drums behind our entrenchments begun to beat, and a long and steady roll it
                  was too. Old Put come gallopin' along from Bunker Hill, jest back of usâ€”you see
                  we'd got on to Breed's Hill instead o' Bunkerâ€”and he led the men forrard into the
                  fight. He rode a splendid dark bay horse, and then it was all of a lather. He went
                  this way and that with the fury of a thunderbolt. He wasn't either here or there;
                  he was everywhere, except in the redoubt itself. He was orderin' one regiment here
                  to one post, and another there to another. One company he ordered at the rail
                  fence on the right hand of the redoubt, and another he ordered to the open place
                  on the left, between the rail fence there and the breastwork, and some he told to
                  find their places anywhere along the line.</p>
               <p>"Jest as the battle was about to begin, too, the old war-scarred Pomeroy come into
                  the lines a-foot, right amongst us, jest as if he was no better 'n than the worst
                  of us. You see old Gen'ral Pomeroy had made a good many muskets in his day
                  himself; and the sight of him made the fellers that even then carried so many of
                  'em in their hands, almost crazy for joy. I never see a set o' men so stirred
                  clean to the bottom as we all was. We all felt certain o' victory then; and I'm
                  sure there wasn't a man that carried one of his make o' muskets that didn't
                  resolve, the minnit he see him comin', that his musket shouldn't suffer for
                  disgrace. By the way, they said that Gen'ral Pomeroy first heard the firin' of the
                  cannons in Cambridge, over at the camp. They pricked up his spirit jest as they
                  would that of an old war horse. He couldn't stay where he was another hourâ€”no, nor
                  another minnit. He vowed he'd go to the field o' battle, if he went a foot!â€”and
                  that was the kind o' soldiers that the British gunpowder couldn't conquer,
                  how-somever many of 'em it might <emph>kill!</emph> He told Gen'ral Ward, the
                  commander-in-chief at Cambridge, what he was goin' to do, and that was to go to
                  battle; and he asked him to lend him a horse. This the Gen'ral was glad enough to
                  do, and he lent him an elegant and valuable one. Pomeroy, with his musket across
                  his shoulder, rode the horse down to the neck, and when he see the shot that raked
                  that place from the enemy's vessels, he stopped short."</p>
               <p>"Afraid?" interrupted one of the listeners.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Afraid!</emph>" repeated Verd-Antique after him, in a voice of thunder.
                  "Was the old man ever known to be afraid of <emph>anything,</emph> living or dead?
                  Afraid! but what was there for <emph>him</emph> to be afraid of, sure enough? No;
                  he gave the steed to a sentry that was posted there, and marched across himself
                  through all that takin' fire, jest as cool and calm as if a hundred balls of all
                  shapes and sizes warn't whizzin' and sailin' by his head! There's bravery for you!
                  Gen'ral Pomeroy afraid! There never'll be another story to tell, after
                     <emph>that's</emph> proved to be true?</p>
               <p>"Warren, he went into the redoubt jest like a common soldier, for all the world;
                  and there he was, the president of the provincial congress, and as fine a
                  gentleman as ever was! Colonel Prescott stepped up to him, they said, and asked
                  him if he wouldn't take the command of the place; but he answered him 'No,' and
                  said that he should be glad to learn his duty from a soldier of so much experience
                  as he was!</p>
               <p>"The columns of the enemy begun to move up the hill now; and every little while
                  they stoppedâ€”I s'pose to give the artillery a chance to make a passage for them
                  clean through the breastwork. Major-Gen'ral Howe commanded the reg'lars, and he
                  walked out with a military step some hundred and fifty yards in front of 'em, and
                  begun to reconnoitre. He see there was a good swab of us, I reckon, and I rather
                  guess he didn't altogether like the kind o' breastworks we'd put up so unexpected
                  like between ourselves and his troops. But <emph>that</emph> couldn't be helped
                  any way, and all there was left for him to do was to dislodge us. If he could
                  drive us from our ground, why, the entrenchments were his; that's all.</p>
               <p>"As soon as the enemy's columns begun to open and show themselves in shape aginst
                  us, I tell ye it was the tightest kind o' work for our men to keep from firin' at
                  'em. We could see their gay rigementals gliterin' in the sun, and the great high
                  knapsacks stuck up a long ways above their shoulders. They had long and glistenin'
                  bayonets on the end o' their guns, that shone enough to dazzle the brightest eyes
                  there was peekin' over the works that day. Old Put come tearin' along by us all,
                  singin' out to us in a husky voiceâ€”'Don't fire, boys, till you have the order!
                  Don't fire till they git within eight rods! Powder's scarce, you know, and it
                  mustn't be wasted! You mustn't fire at 'em till you see the whites o' their eyes;
                  and then fire low, and take aim at their waistbands! You're all of you first rate
                  marksmen, and can kill a squirrel a hundred yards off; keep back your fire as long
                  as you can, and the whole of 'em 'll have to go! Aim at them handsome coats!â€”pick
                  off them commanders?'</p>
               <p>"Some of 'em was within a short shot of the redoubt, and the sharp shooters in
                  there couldn't let such a good chance go to pick some of 'em off. They let drive
                  their charges at 'em. They said there never was a madder feller than old Prescott
                  was then, never <emph>nowhere.</emph> He waved his sword over their heads, and
                  swore by all that was good that he'd run the first man through that did the thing
                  again, before he got his orders from him. He told 'em that <emph>he</emph> knew
                  what was the best jest then, and he'd let all know jest when to fire their pieces.
                  The enemy got within the eight rods of our lines, and Old Put gave the word along
                  the line, and Col. Prescott in the redoubt, to be sure of a good aim, to let every
                  musket cover its man, and then fire. We all fired! Great God!â€”how they fell before
                  us! It was jest as if there had been a great scythe in the hands of the Almighty,
                  and he had <emph>mowed</emph> 'em down with a single sweep! But up they come
                  again, as brave as the front lines that had jest fallen; and down they went again
                  upon the green sod, to hug those that were already bitin' the dirt before 'em.
                  'Twant no use, their tryin' to get at us through the breastworks, for our men's
                  aim was alto<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6939-00000015"/> gether too sure for'em. They
                  were obliged to wheel about quicker 'n they came up, and go back down the
                  hill.</p>
               <p>"Down under the cover of the hill they halted and rallied themselves agin. Then
                  they formed into line, and the drums begin to roll, and they begin to march up the
                  hill a second time. They looked a trifle tired as they come up, and I thought it
                  was hard work for 'em to have to walk right over the dead bodies of their
                  companions as they did. But the sight only made their cheeks turn whiter, and they
                  ground their teeth tighter together, and I thought they meant to have their
                  revenge on us for it. On they come, all in good order, lookin' as straight at us
                  as if they were going to <emph>face</emph> us down, instead of <emph>shoot</emph>
                  us down. They got within their eight rods of us agin, and the word come along the
                  lines for us to fire. We give 'em another jest such volley as we did when they
                  come up before, and they dropped like apples from a tree, when a feller's in the
                  limbs, a shakin' it. There's no tellin' what a heap of dead and wounded ones lay
                  round there. The ground was covered with them; and not only covered, but it was
                     <emph>piled up</emph> with them!</p>
               <p>"Some of our men would hold their fire till they could pick out an officer from
                  the enemy's lines; then they'd say to one anotherâ€”there! there! see that officer!
                  let's have a shot at him!' The rest would sayâ€”'no, no, not yet! wait till he gets
                  a little nearer!' I see 'em pick out one officer in pertikler in that way. He was
                  on horseback; and the only one we saw of the enemy on horseback, all that day. He
                  rode up as proud and unconcerned to the rail fence as if there wasn't
                  nobody-behind it, when our boys got a good sight of him. 'There, there!' said
                  they; 'd'ye see that officerâ€”that one on horseback? let's fire at him!' 'No, no!'
                  said some of the rest of 'em, wait till he gits to that little knoll yonder, and
                  then we'll fire! <emph>Now!</emph>"â€”and as many as a dozen bullets struck him. He
                  fell off his horse quicker 'n a squirrel off a high tree, and a good deal deader!
                  He was found out to be Major Pitcairn, an officer that told the Americans at
                  Lexington that they were <emph>rebels,</emph> and ordered them to disperse.</p>
               <p>"Another of the British officers was in our eye, named Major Small. Almost every
                  other officer near him had been shot down, and he was stand in' pretty much alone.
                  The boys had their muskets pointed at him, and in another minnit they would have
                  given the word to pick him off, and he'd have gone where the rest of 'em did; but
                  jest then Old Put rode furiously along by us and see what we was doin'. He
                  recognized Major Small as an old friend; you see h'd fit with him against the
                  French and the cussed Injins, and knew him jest as well as I do both of you. He
                  waved his old sword in our faces, and knocked up our muskets in the air, and says
                  heâ€”'For God's sake, my lads, don't fire at that man! I love him as I do my own
                     brother!'<ref rend="super" target="#note_005" xml:id="return_005">*</ref>
                   That was enough for any of us. We wouldn't have harmed a hair of his
                  blessed head, for <unclear>we</unclear> knew that he was a dear friend of Old Put;
                  and Old Put was most as much as our hearts could hold himself.</p>
               <note place="foot" xml:id="note_005">
                  
                  <p><ref target="#return_005">*</ref>The above strict historical fact was related in the following manner by
                     Colonel Small himself to Turnbull, the renowned American painter, in London,
                     in the summer of 1786â€”three years after the termination of the war. Colonel
                     Small, looking at Turnbull's great picture of the Battle of Bunker Bill,
                     <unclear>broke</unclear> out to the painter: "I don't like the situation
                     in which you have placed my old friend Putnam; you have not done him
                     justice. I wish you would alter that part of your picture, and introduce a
                     circumstance which actually happened, and which I can never forget. When the
                     British troops advanced the second time to the attack of the redoubt, I,
                     with the other officers, was in front of the line to encourage the men. We
                     had advanced very near the works undisturbed, when an irregular fire, like a
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">feu-de-joie,</foreign> was poured in upon us; it
                     was cruelly fatal. The troops fell back, and when I looked to the right and
                     left, I saw <emph>not an officer standing.</emph> I glanced my eye to the
                     enemy, and saw several young men levelling their pieces at me. I knew their
                     excel lence as marksmen, and considered myself gone. At that moment, my old
                     friend Putnam rushed forward, and striking up the muzzles of their pieces
                     with his sword, cried out 'For God's sake, my lads! don't fire at that man!
                     I love him as I do my own brother!' We were so near each other that I heard
                     his words distinctly. He was obeyed. I bowed, thanked him, and walked away
                     unmolested."</p>
               </note>
               <p>"It was right in the midst of this second fight, too, that we discovered all
                  Charlestown was afire. It was an awful sight of itself; but when you come to add
                  it to the battle before us, 'twas enough to make the stoutest heart quail and
                  quiver. There was a great cloud of smoke, bigger than anything you or I can,
                  possibly imagine; and there come jest a light wind from the south'ard, and blew it
                  right over the spot where the fightin' was goin' on. It looked like a huge thunder
                  cloud.</p>
               <p>"But they hadn't more than took a second round from our well-directed guns, before
                  they turned their backs on us, and started down the hill like so many sheep
                  without a leader. We was in hopes they wouldn't try it again; for we thought they
                  must have got all they wanted this time. But they hadn't any sooner got to the
                  bottom of the hill than Gen'ral Howe begun to spur 'em up agin the best way he
                  knew how. Some of the officers warnt for having the men come up again, for they
                  thought 'twant much more than downright butchery to lead 'em up there before our
                  breastworks; but the older ones and them in the higher ranks resolved not to have
                  it said in old England that their fine troops were driven off by a mob o'
                     <emph>rebels,</emph> did behind a wall of hay and dirt. Not they! So they come
                  on towards us agin. Howe, he led on aginst the redoubt, and Clinton, who had
                  rushed over from Boston as fast as he could come,â€”mad as a March hare at seein'
                  his men cut down so like ripe clover,â€”Clinton, he joined the British marines in
                  tryin' to turn our right flank, while the artillery were pushed forrerd more 'n
                  before, to turn the left of our breastwork, where there was an open space for 'em,
                  and the only place where they could rake our whole line. We made every preparation
                  to meet 'em that we could, and Old Put rode backwards and forrerds on his horse
                  all covered with foam, to fetch up the reinforcements. The enemy was comin' agin.
                  This time they seemed to have learnt something: for they flung away their great
                  onhandy knapsacks, and some of 'em even took off their regimental tal coats and
                  flung <emph>them</emph> away. They seemed to understand themselves. Up they come
                  the same as before. Old Put knew we hadn't but precious little powder left, and he
                  told us we must use it to the best advantage. He told us to have every shot take
                  effect. Some of us didn't have but jest one charge left to go into that fight
                  with.</p>
               <p>"The British artillery come up to the place between the breastwork on our left and
                  the rail fence I've told ye about. There they poured into us a steady fire, such
                  as no mortal army could stand. 'Twas impossible. They turned our left and raked
                  our whole line so that their balls whizzed right straight through the open
                  sally-port into the redoubt itself. The men at the breastworks had to retire then.
                  There was nothing else left for 'em. The British kept coming on, and advanced on
                  every side of the redoubt except the north. They had made up their minds to scale
                  our works, as they'd ought to have known enough to do in the first place, and
                  there was no withstandin' them. We were out of ammunition, and our men hadn't got
                  no bayonets; and there the British soldiers had each of 'em, a gleamin' bayonet to
                  his gun, half as long as his body. One of their head officers run up behind the
                  breastworks they'd cleared, to a corner of the redoubt, and climbed up on to it by
                  the help of an apple tree that stood there. Then he called out for his men to
                  foller on. On they come, in squads and snarls. Troops follered troops over the
                  parapet, till there wasn't no tellin' when the last of 'em would come. I got into
                  the redoubt myself this time, and see how 'twas done. Prescott told us to club our
                  muskets and beat 'em back. 'Stone 'em!' said he, 'knock 'em down with your
                  muskets! Anything, so you drive 'em back!' But there warnt no use in that kind of
                  game. It was all on one side too much for our men, and we had to begin to think of
                  gettin' out of the place in the decentest way we could, without bein' thought
                  cowards. Prescott would have stood and died there, I verily believe; but he saw it
                  wasn't right to risk the lives of his brave men to no good, and he was obliged at
                  last to give the order to retreat.</p>
               <p>"They enemy was all round us now, and we had to fight our way through 'em. I could
                  see that Gen'ral Warren hung on to the very last. He didn't seem to be willing to
                  give it up at all. I never see such pluck in such a gentleman as he was. He kept
                  beatin' 'em back, and I thought he rather seemed to <emph>want</emph> to the shot
                  by some of their balls. He hadn't got but a few yards from the redoubt, however,
                  when one come, sure enough, and took him through the head. Col. Small knew him,
                  and told him to stand and save his life; but the Gen'ral kept on. Small told his
                  men not to fire, and threw up their guns with his sword; but the ball was fired
                  before <emph>he</emph> could stop it, and he lay down by the side of a little
                  locust tree that was close by, looked up with one of his heavenly smiles, and
                  died!</p>
               <p>"The British daren't fire at this time, for fear they might kill some of their own
                  number. Their right and left wings faced each other now, and the Americans was
                  between 'em. While they was formin' agin, so as to be all in one body, our men
                  collected themselves pretty well together, and began to retreat the best we could.
                  Old Put drove his spurs into his foaming horse, and rode up between us and the
                  enemy! and the energy want a step more than twelve rods from him either!<ref
                     rend="super" target="#note_006" xml:id="return_006">*</ref>
                   We all looked to see the brave old man fall every minnit; but he wasn't
                  born to be shot <emph>that</emph> day He called out to us to make a stand again on
                  Bunker Hillâ€”the next hill back of where we'd been fightin'â€”and he pledged his word
                  and sacred honor that we'd lick 'em clean out! But some-how the men didn't seem
                  over willing to try it agin. They thought they'd done one good day's work a-ready.
                  And so they had, too. Old Put had a lot of spades and other tools in his hands,
                  that he'd picked up, determined to carry off everything he could from the rascally
                  British. He took his stand close to a field-piece we were passing, and begged us
                  not to desert, and disgrace our gen'ral. But the British bayonets was comin' too
                  thick upon us. There wasn't but one man that dared to stand by the old Gen'ral at
                  that gun, and he was a sargeant. The British shot him down, and their bayonets
                  were close onto Old Put himself, when he left it to them. The old man seemed to
                     <emph>defy</emph> 'em to shoot him; and he acted jest as if he could gather us
                  all up in one of his generous hands and carry us off himself to a place of safety.
                  We went with him back as far as Prospect Hill, and the next morning we had as good
                  an intrenchment to show to the British as they had seen on <emph>that</emph>
                  morning. This is the most I've got to tell you of that famous Battle; you'd ought
                  to have been in it, to know jest what <emph>was</emph> done, and <emph>how</emph>
                  'twas done. I hope I hav'nt tired you out;" and with these words, the old hero
                  took a fresh quid of tobacco, and stretched his limbs out upon the ground.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE NIGHT BEFORE THE ARMY LEFT NEW YORK.</head>
               <p>Late in August, and the battle of Long Island had been fought; that battle which,
                  considered in almost every aspect, resulted so disastrously to our arms. We had
                  lost, in killed, wounded and prisoners, according to the account of General
                  Washington, fully a thousand men; while the loss of the enemy could not have
                  exceeded four hundred. That famous retreat across to New York had been
                  accomplished under cover of night and a fortunate fog, and all the American stores
                  and means of defence were safe in camp in the city.</p>
               <p>It was now the manifest design of the enemy to make a regular descent upon New
                  York itself, for the purpose either of taking our camp, or dislodging our forces.
                  A portion of their fleet doubled Long Island for that purpose, and made their
                  appearance in the Sound; while the main body of the same boldly entered the
                  harbor, and came to anchor very nearly within cannon shot of the city.</p>
               <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6939-00000016"/>
               <p>The American commander saw, with unmistakeable precision, what the intentions of
                  the enemy were, and a council of war was at once convened. It was resolved to
                  abandon the city at the earliest possible moment. No time was lost, accordingly,
                  in removing the military stores to some far point above, upon the banks of the
                  Hudson. The commander-in-chief himself retired to Harlem Heights, and a strong
                  force was posted at King's Bridge, in the northern part of the island.</p>
               <p>On the 15th of September, 1776, the enemy landed a strong detachment on the east
                  side of New York Island, in the neighborhood of three miles above the city.
                  Meeting with little or no resistance, they took a position stretching across the
                  island at Blooming-dale, five miles north of the City Hall, and two from the
                  American lines. On the following day, advanced parties on both sides met and
                  skirmished, to the decided advantage of our own army. The men, who had already
                  grown dispirited in consequence of their retreat from Long Island, now fought like
                  tigers, knowing that the eye of their commander was upon their conduct, and wholly
                  desirous of retrieving their past loss and disgrace. But our victories were not
                  purchased with nothing. They were bought with a price; and the price of the
                  victory of the 16th of September was the life of Colonel Knowlton, of the
                  Connecticut line, a native of the eastern part of the state, and the life of Major
                  Leitch, of Virginia. They fought like valiant men, as they were, at the head of
                  their troops; and both fell mortally wounded.<ref rend="super" target="#note_007"

                   The manner in which Washington noticed the affair in his General Orders
                   was, in a high degree, inspiriting to the whole army.</p>

                              <p>The General most heartily thanks the troops commanded yesterday
                                 by Major Leitch, who first advanced upon the enemy, and the
                                 others who so resolutely supported them. The behavior yesterday
                                 was such a contrast to that of some of the troops the day
                                 before, as must show what may be done, where officers and
                                 soldiers will exert themselves. Once more therefore, the General
                                 calls upon officers and men to act up to the noble cause in
                                 which they are engaged, and to support the <emph>honor</emph>
                                 and <emph>liberties</emph> of their country.</p>

                                 fighting, Captain Brown is to take command of the party lately
                                 led by Colonel Knowlton. Officers and men are to obey him
                                 accordingly.</p>

               <p>Not deeming it altogether the best policy to attack the fortified camp of the
                  Americans, General Howe made a movement to gain their rear, and so cut off their
                  communication with the eastern states. With this intent, a large part of the
                  British left New York, and passing up the Sound, landed near the village of
                  Westchester, at Frog's Point; while another portion was dispatched up the Hudson,
                  in three frigates, to cut off the American communications with the Jerseys.
                  Washington withdrew his troops altogether, therefore, from New York Island, and
                  stretched his line along the course of the Bronx river, in the direction of White
                  Plains. On the 28th of October was fought the battle of White Plainsâ€”a battle
                  yielding the Americans no satisfactory result. General Putnam took part in that
                  engagement, being ordered by General Washington with a detachment to push forward
                  and support Brigadier-General McDougal, whose position had been assailed</p>
               <p>It was on the evening before the day of the evacuation of New York city by the
                  American army, that a young person, attired in female apparel, knocked softly upon
                  the door of the mansion of Mr. Elton Edwards, in Queen street.</p>
               <p>Susan, the maid, obeyed the summons, and, following close upon her heels, came Mr.
                  Edwards himself. His mind was in a state of great perplexity in relation to the
                  recent battle and the quartering of the American forces within the city, and he
                  deemed it no more than an act of prudence to be at hand in case the servant met
                  with unpleasant business at the door. But as soon as he saw that it was only a
                  female at the door, he shrunk back from the forward position he had taken, and
                  appeared disposed to say nothing.</p>
               <p>"Are ye to home, so that I can see ye alone tonight?" asked the visiter of Susan,
                  lowering her voice and catching her by the hand.</p>
               <p>"I'm not goin' to be busy," replied the servant, hardly knowing what to say in her
                  sudden surprise.</p>
               <p>"Ye don't <emph>know</emph> me, Susan!" exclaimed the visiter, in a tone
                  remarkably low and clear, and studiously below the pitch at which Mr. Edwards
                  might have heard it.</p>
               <p>"Heavens! yes! Come in, Mary. <emph>Do</emph> come in!" exclaimed the shrewd
                  servant, plucking hold of the visiter's sleeve and drawing her in towards her</p>
               <p>"Fasten the door, Susan," ordered Mr. Edwards, seeing that the visiter was only
                  some company for Susan. "We must be very careful, when these American soldiers are
                  about. No one can tell what they may do nextâ€”a miserable pack of rebellious
                  scoundrels!" and with these words he turned and went up stairs. Susan and her
                  company went into the kitchen below stairs, while Mr. Edwards walked slowly up
                  stairs to his daughter.</p>
               <p>He had not been gone a great while, however, when he suddenly returned to bid
                  Susan go up and keep her young mistress company a while, for he was going out a
                  little ways; and her company could go with her, if she chose. He felt that both of
                  themâ€”though femalesâ€”would afford a greater protection for his daughter than one of
                  them would. Accordingly, he went out at the street door and bade Susan fasten it
                  after him, which she was very glad indeed to do. Then hurrying up to the side of
                  her mistress, her visiter following close on, she bounded into the room and sat
                  down quite unceremoniously.</p>
               <p>"Who have you with you, Susan?" asked Laura Edwards, when she saw the visiter
                  enter behind her.</p>
               <p>"Oh, it's no one but a girl that's come in to see me this evening, mistress; one
                  of my neighbors."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Miss Edwards," added the visiter.</p>
               <p>Laura started slightly at hearing the stranger's voice, but discovered nothing
                  like alarm.</p>
               <p>"Did you see anything going on in the streets, as you came along!" asked she.</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am, I saw very much going on," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"What was it?"</p>
               <p>"They say the Americans are going to leave the city early in the morning, or at
                  least as soon as they can."</p>
               <p>"Do they! do they!" exclaimed Laura, dropping her eye to the carpet, and drumming
                  uneasily with her little slippered foot upon the same.</p>
               <p>The stranger's eye caught the change in her expression, and she ventured to go
                  on:</p>
               <p>"The stores are already gone a good ways up the river. The army is going to leave
                  at once in pursuit of them."</p>
               <p>"But where got <emph>you</emph> this news? Who told <emph>you</emph> all this?
                  Perhaps there are soldiers in the family in which you live?"</p>
               <p>"No, ma'am," was the answer.</p>
               <p>"How then came you to know of this so early?"</p>
               <p>"I am a soldier myself!" replied the stranger, rising to his feet, and ceasing to
                  counterfeit the voice that of right belonged to him.</p>
               <p>"Henry! my dear Henry!" exclaimed the equally delighted and astonished girl,
                  rising from her seat and rushing to the open arms of her lover.</p>
               <p>The servant Susan could no longer refrain from the enjoyment of the laugh she had
                  so long repressed, and gave way to it with a strange zest indeed.</p>
               <p>"You come in disguise, Henry," said Laura, looking at him with delighted eye. "Why
                  was it?"</p>
               <p>"Because I could come in no other manner," replied he. "I needn't have found much
                  difficulty in getting away from post; but the thing was, to get in to your
                  father's house."</p>
               <p>"You <emph>were</emph> ingenious," said she, regarding him again with a remarkably
                  tender and affectionate look.</p>
               <p>"Wasn't I? This woman's dress! He never would <emph>suspect</emph> such a
                  thing!"</p>
               <p>"No, indeed. But do you tell me truly," said she, suffering herself to be led to
                  the sofa by him, and motioning Susan out of the room at the same momentâ€”"do you
                  tell me truly that you are going away tomorrow?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, with the army."</p>
               <p>"And who will come into the city next?" inquired she, looking sad.</p>
               <p>"The British, I suppose. At any rate, it wouldn't do for <emph>us</emph> to stay
                  where we are any longer; we should be surrounded, and taken prisoners, every man
                  of us."</p>
               <p>"Oh, are those British troops coming, then, into the city, to act like savages and
                  cannibals among us?"</p>
               <p>"I do not apprehend they will do as bad as that," replied he.</p>
               <p>"I've heard enough of them, and I wish I could persuade father to move away into
                  the country, out of the reach of all of them."</p>
               <p>"But as he is a loyalist, he is much the safer here. This will be just the place
                  for him, for when the enemy once got possession here, it will be a difficult
                  matter to get them out again. Our forces are scattered, and they will be for a
                  long time to come. The enemy command the water, and <emph>they</emph> can go and
                  come when and whither they please; but it isn't so with us."</p>
               <p>"Then I may not know when I shall see you again, Henry! And you may be killed in
                  battle, too!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but I shall then at least know in whose hands my memory will be safe!"
                  replied he.</p>
               <p>The remark set a train of thought in operation in her mind, which she continued to
                  pursue, without interruption for several moments; then she spoke and saidâ€”</p>
               <p>"Let me go with you, Henry."</p>
               <p>"Devoted angel!" cried he, embracing her to his bosom and looking through the
                  filmy tears that quickly gathered in his eye. "Your life is too precious to throw
                  away! Where could I carry you, that you would be safe from all harm? Nowhere.
                  There could be no place where you would be as safe as you will be here under the
                  protection of your own father and the authorities that will soon enter to exercise
                  their away. No, Laura, forget the thought, and remain where you are! There is no
                  safety for you anywhere else! Promise me then that you will be happy here!"</p>
               <p>"As happy as I am able," said she, sobbing, and laying her head upon his offering
                  shoulder.</p>
               <p>"Enough, enough!" replied he; "it is all I can ask! If Providence spares my life
                  through whatever engagements I may be called into with the enemy, then depend upon
                  seeing me here at some future day."</p>
               <p>"What! if the British are here, too?"</p>
               <p>"It will make but little difference with me, <emph>I</emph> shall do what I can to
                  get to you."</p>
               <p>"But I fear to trust to such specious hopes. I had rather expect nothing, Henry,
                  and then suffer no disappointment."</p>
               <p>"Trust me for finding the way here. I shall do that. Have not come here
                  tonight?"</p>
               <p>"You haveâ€”you have!" replied the young girl, her reason coming to her in time to
                  enable her to see that she had been deceiving herself and doing injustice to her
                  lover.</p>
               <p>What passed more than this between the two young people, until they heard the
                  thundering on the outer door at the hand of Mr. Edwards, it behooves us not to
                  say. Suffice it, that there were many warm tears shed, many sad words of farewell
                  spoken, and many living and loving promises uttered between them. Mr. Edwards came
                  thundering through the hall, and the disguised soldier was behind Susan at the
                  door through which he came. When the father entered the parlor where the so recent
                  interview had been held, he discovered nothing of his daughter. She had gone into
                  the solitude of her own chamber, there to commune with her own saddest thoughts,
                  and to pray for a light to shine through the thick darkness of the<pb n="32-33"
                     xml:id="VAC6939-00000017"/> cloud that overhung and enveloped all her hopes and
                  prospects.</p>
               <p>Henry Byram, the soldier, returned to his quarters as soon as he had divested
                  himself of the disguise he had assumed, and was soon dreaming in comparative quiet
                  and comfort of the more than a dream he had just broken himself away from, and of
                  the days that were before him in their dread array.</p>
               <p>Late that night, a man came to the quarters of Israel Putnam, and demanded of the
                  sentry to see him.</p>
               <p>"Away with you for a drunken fellow!" shouted the guard, not thinking that a real
                  soldier would be out at that time of the night for any good purpose.</p>
               <p>"I'tell ye, I <emph>must</emph> see him!" replied the comer; "it's on business of
                  importance to some one!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, <emph>that's</emph> the game you're going to think to play with me, is it?
                  Well then, let me tell you that if you are not gone from here in just three
                  minutes' time, I shall run you through with my bayonet!"</p>
               <p>"No you won't do no sich thing!" retorted the visiter, very coolly.</p>
               <p>"And what's the <emph>reason</emph> I won't?" demanded the sentry, advancing upon
                  him with bayonet levelled to his breast, as if to assure both the intruder and
                  himself of the authority he held in his hands.</p>
               <p>"Because you won't; that's reason enough! Come, let me in to the Gen'ral!"</p>
               <p>"Advance but one step and I shoot you down in your tracks!" cried out the
                  sentinel.</p>
               <p>Their further conversation was interrupted by the approach of a couple of
                  individuals, who on nearer view proved to be a white man and a negro.</p>
               <p>"Gen'ral! my dear old Gen'ral!" cried out the stranger who had uselessly tried to
                  obtain an entrance for some minutes past.</p>
               <p>"John Horton!" exclaimed General Putnamâ€”for he it wasâ€”"is that you? Any news?"</p>
               <p>"Not special," was the reply; "but I'd wanted to see you! <emph>Now</emph> I guess
                  you'll know me when I come your way agin!" said he, turning tauntingly upon the
                  sentry.</p>
               <p>"Why, did he refuse you admission?" inquired the General.</p>
               <p>"Yes, he did; and what's more, he was a-goin' to baggonet me in three minnits
                  more!"</p>
               <p>"You would have killed in that event one of the bravest men and warmest friends
                  your country's got!" replied the General, turning to the sentry likewise. "But I
                  commend you for doing your duty so well. Where men are so vigilant, there's but
                  little room for treachery to creep in!"</p>
               <p>"Never was anything truer 'n that, Gen'ral," said Verd-Antique, walking
                  majestically in at the door behind him.</p>
               <p>The negro, who was none other than the body-servant of the Generalâ€”Dick
                     Fortune<ref rend="super" target="#note_008" xml:id="return_008">*</ref>
                   â€”followed close on, neither heeding what he heard, nor the not-altogether
                  inviting appearance of the man who preceded him. Still, Verd-Antique was a person
                  by no means unknown to Dick, and he was not surprised to see him perform any sort
                  of an operation that could have been performed by a human, except as he showed it
                  in his trifling wayâ€”training open his eyes until there was nothing but whites to
                  them.</p>
               <note place="foot" xml:id="note_008">
                  
                  <p><ref target="#return_008">*</ref>Such was, in reality, the name of the body-servant who attended the General
                     through all his revolutionary campaigns.</p>
               </note>
               <p>The interview between Verd-Antique and General Putnam was secret and long. When,
                  at length, the former left his apartment, he strode down the stairs past the
                  sentinel with a heavy tread, and then walked away at a rapid pace towards the
                  north.</p>
               <p>He had not been long on his feet, however, before he stopped before the window of
                  one of the rooms of house he appeared not unacquainted with, and looked in through
                  a pane for a moment with much steadfastness. The house was known to himâ€”as it is
                  already known to our readersâ€”by the name of "The Eel Pot." He finally hurried up
                  to the door, which he flung open quite leisurely in comparison, and then
                  proceeding across the contracted space that was dignified with the name 'entry,'
                  he opened the door of the bar-room and entered.</p>
               <p>"John Horton for ever!" shouted two or three of the men that stood ranged before
                  the dirty counter, with their glasses freshly primed for a new draught.</p>
               <p>The new-comer acknowledged their friendly welcome only by a cold nod of the head.
                  It spoke a great deal more than words could have done.</p>
               <p>"John Horton!" shouted one of the crew, while he advanced towards him and took him
                  by the coat-collar, and proceeded to drag him, not much against his will, to the
                  place where the refreshment was to be had.</p>
               <p>"Where do you come from?" asked two or three more, simultaneously. "You look
                  tired. Come, John! step up and have some Jamaica, or some Holland, with us!"</p>
               <p>The invitation needed not repetition by any one, for the new-comer already felt
                  the need of a refreshing draught, as General Putnam had forgotten to place in his
                  hand the glass of spirits and water usual with him. Accordingly, he advanced to
                  the bar and helped himself as generously as any of them to the inspiriting
                  beverage proffered him.</p>
               <p>There was a man in the room whom John had long been accustomed to see at "The Eel
                  Pot," whom everybody called Tim Flood. He was professedly a lunatic, and the
                  noticeable phases and characteristics of his disorder did not present themselves
                  except at particular times. At all other times, he was generally disposed to
                  calmness and a soporific manner, and his thoughts seemed to run altogether in a
                  poetic channel. He was addicted to the strangest style of expressions, and some of
                  them, too, wrapped in a covering of the most airy and graceful poetry.</p>
               <p>When Verd-Antique came in, and while he was engaged in receiving the numberless
                  congratulations of his friends and making way with his potation, this man stood
                  behind and apart from the rest, apparently absorbed in a deep leverie. As soon as
                  Verd Antique was in a degree rid of the more pressing importunity of his friends,
                  he drew near Tim, and accosted him withâ€”</p>
               <p>"Are you lonely, Tim?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied the strange being, looking up through his peculiarly light eyes,
                  and shaking the pendent locks of his nut-brown hair. "Yes, I <emph>am</emph>
                  lonely. Will you go home with me? I am young you know, and I like company.
                  Mother's sick on the bed, and I think she'll die. I'm young yet, you know, and I
                  ought to have company. Hadn't I?"</p>
               <p>"I think you had," replied Verd-Antique, willing to encourage him in any whim or
                  fancy that might pervade his brain for the moment.</p>
               <p>"Is the moon in the full to-night?" asked the young unfortunate. "If it is, I must
                  go on my revel again. It's only when the moon is in the full that I go to revel;
                  and my heart is just as full as that is, too, until it almost bursts sometimes. Is
                  the moon full to night?"</p>
               <p>"No," answered John, "I saw no moon in the sky when I came in. But isn't it late
                  for you to leave your poor mother so much alone, Timmy?"</p>
               <p>"I <emph>know</emph> she's alone. She <emph>loves</emph> to be alone. The angels
                  come through the lattice to her sometimes, when she's alone, and they never come
                  when I'm there with her!"</p>
               <p>"I guess <emph>you're</emph> the angel she thinks the most of," replied John.
                  "You'd ought to be home so late tonight, Tim. The British'll come into the city
                  before long, and it won't do for you to leave your mother <emph>then</emph> You
                  must stay at home, Tim. There'll be sorrow for her if you don't."</p>
               <p>"Sorrow, will there? Then I'll go <emph>now.</emph> I never thought there was
                  sorrow where there were angels. But I forget, I may be mistaken. I may not know
                  what the sorrow is you speak of. Will it come to her, did you say?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, if you don't stay by her more."</p>
               <p>"Oh, then I'll go back to her. But she is <emph>never</emph> glad. She is always
                  tearful and sad. She never wears a smile on her face for me. She always speaks
                  pleasant words, but her eye is cold and dull, and her hand is never warm when I
                  take hold of it, as she thrusts it out to me. Is this the reason why there's
                  sorrow?"</p>
               <p>Even the usually-sagacious and self-possessed Verd-Antique was at a loss how to
                  reply to him, and stood leaning in silence upon the little bar and gazing intently
                  into the eyes that for no whole moment expressed a continuity of similar thoughts
                  or emotions. All was shifting, like the views of a kaleidescope, or like the
                  bubbling and boiling of cool, clear water over beautiful pebbles in a brook or
                  pool.</p>
               <p>"I walk o' nights, friend," continued the young demented one. "I go out and ramble
                  through the graveyard when the moon shines on the white stones; and I kneel down
                  and see who is asleep under them, and how many years they were awake, and whether
                  they died happy as I live, or not. I pluck all the pale primroses, too, I can find
                  growing about the grave-yard fences, and gather them into large bouquets, so big I
                  can hardly hold them in my arms; and then I go and lay them down by the heads of
                  such as the tombstones tell me died happy. Isn't <emph>that</emph> a fancy?
                  Getting bouquets by the moonlight! Who ever heard of such a thing but poor Tim
                  Flood? Who ever did, surely?"</p>
               <p>John Horton, with all the roughness of his exterior, had a great many refinements
                  about his natural heart. He could pick off an enemy, or club a musket, or handle a
                  knife, as coolly and effectively as they who do such things their manhood through;
                  but for all that, there was a chord in his heart that the silly, yet saddened
                  speech of this poor driveller had touched most tenderly. He felt as if he could
                  not bear to hear him talk longer. He pitied him from the depths of his warm heart.
                  He thought all this was only a lamentable mockery of the real life, and of the
                  living soul, that should be in man, and he determined at once to stop the young
                  babbler's melancholy pratings. If he listened to him as long as he would talk,
                  there would be no telling but he might become suddenly moonstruck himself. So,
                  taking the pitiful object by the hand, he led him gently out the door to the
                  street, and urged him to hurry homeward to his mother as rapidly as he could.</p>
               <p>"That's melancholy," said he to Paul Potter, the host of "The Eel Pot," as soon as
                  he had returned again.</p>
               <p>"What," said Paul, "that boy?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Indeed it is, John," replied he. "But we don't any of us know what to make of
                  him. His mother is said to be quite a delicate woman, and still a good deal young.
                  She's lived about here this many a year, and yet I've never seen her to know her.
                  Some say she's been crossed in love; and some, that her husband cleared out a long
                  time ago, and left her to shift with her child for herself. But how that is, I
                  can't say. I must say, too, that I ruther like the boy, he's got such an
                  interestin' kind of expression about his countenance, and he never was known to do
                  nobody harm, dead or alive."</p>
               <p>"I couldn't bear to hear him talk," said Verd-Antique, "and so I led him to the
                  door and sent him home."</p>
               <p>By this time the room of Paul Potter had become considerably thinned out. The men
                  who had prolonged their evening's socialities to the hour when John Horton arrived
                  among them, were fast hieing their usual courses homeward; and, when the latter
                  saw that the coast was sufficiently clear, he observed to his friend, the worthy
                  hostâ€”</p>
               <p>"Paul, I must have a horse!"</p>
               <p>"A horse, John? What in the name of good sense do you want of a horse? Legs givin'
                  out? Old muscles growin' tender?"</p>
               <p>"No, nothin' of that, but I want a horse <emph>to-night.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"To-night!" repeated the landlord, more astonished than ever "you'd better turn
                  into one o' my warm<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6939-00000018"/> beds, John. It'll do
                  ye a sight more good than all the horseback ridin' you might do such a night as
                  this."</p>
               <p>"But don't be so hasty, Paul. A horse I <emph>must have,</emph> somehow or other,
                  and have him to-night, too. Can't you accommodate me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but tell a friend where you're going fust, so I shall have evidence that you
                  aint altogether crazy!"</p>
               <p>"That I <emph>can't</emph> tell you," replied Verd-Antique, looking down on the
                  deeply sanded floor and musing a minute or so.</p>
               <p>"Then of course I don't see how I can let you have one, if you can't say where to
                  go."</p>
               <p>"Wal, to King's Bridge, then."</p>
               <p>"As fur as that to-night?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I must, or within a mile or so this side."</p>
               <p>"But when are you comin' back?"</p>
               <p>"That's all onsartin agin."</p>
               <p>"Let you have a horse, when I haint got but two in stable, and you don't know when
                  you're comin' back, nor whether the horse 'll come back with you!
                     <emph>That's</emph> very likely!"</p>
               <p>"Umph!" was she only reply Verd-Antique offered to this.</p>
               <p>"Can't I go with ye?" asked Paul, his countenance brightening, and his
                  inquisitiveness flaming up considerably.</p>
               <p>"I never thought on't."</p>
               <p>"I've got a shay," added the landlord.</p>
               <p>"Or a lumber waggin, purty light?" inquired Verd-Antique.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I've got <emph>that,</emph> too."</p>
               <p>"Then it's all I want. Can ye go soon?"</p>
               <p>"How soon?" asked the landlord, pulling out a huge silver watch and examining its
                  face.</p>
               <p>"Now."</p>
               <p>"Y-e-s; that is, jest as soon as I can harness and fix up things a trifle. I'll
                  shut right up now;" and to work he went with all his energy, closing his inner
                  shutters, counting and pouring into a large deer-skin wallet the silver he had
                  taken through the day, and hurrying out into the stable yard to equip the animal
                  that was at once to serve on the expeditious, and, to Paul Potter, the mysterious
                  journey of that night.</p>
               <p>It took not a great while for everything to be got in readiness for the journey,
                  and Verd-Antique caught the sound of the wheels as the wagon came round before the
                  door, with a peculiar pleasure at his heart. While his friend was gone for the
                  horse and vehicle, he stood leaning against the bar, deeply absorbed in
                  thought.</p>
               <p>"Now we'll warm the inner creetur a trifle before we start off to-night," said the
                  landlord, returning to the bar-room, "for it's a chilly night, and there's a
                  thick, wet fog a layin' over everything. I mistrust if we git any of
                     <emph>that</emph> in our throats, we shall think 'twould have been better to
                  fill 'em with something' else!"</p>
               <p>His companion only smiled and slightly nodded, apparently too much occupied about
                  fears and thoughts of his own, and of a far more important character, to lend any
                  more emphatic expression to his recognition of Paul's philosophical astuteness and
                  excellent general knowledge.</p>
               <p>"Come, John!" said he, holding a glass and a decanter of spirits before him; "wake
                  yourself up with this!"</p>
               <p>Verd-Antique mechanically complied with the urgent and hospitable invitation, and
                  poured out a trifling quantity of the liquid, which, after due dilution, he tossed
                  off at almost a single draught. Then they both hastened to the vehicle before the
                  door, and, as they rolled rapidly away from "The Eel Pot," not a light was to be
                  seen burning in the vicinity, and no sound was to be heard save the continuous
                  rattle and clatter of the wheels of their own crazy vehicle.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE FIRE-FIENDS ARE ON US.</head>
               <p>OUR army had left the city, and the enemy were already in full and undisputed
                  possession. Just at this time occurred one of those great and sweeping disasters
                  that seem specially ordered by a directing Providence for some definite purpose A
                  fire broke out in the city, which for destructiveness and terrific grandeur had
                  never been paralleled in any of the colonies.</p>
               <p>How it took its origin, or how long exactly it raged, people are at this day
                  divided in asserting. But there are none who pretend to doubt that it was a
                  trouble that at that time sorely scourged the victorious and greatly enlivened
                  ranks of the enemy.</p>
               <p>It came blowing its hot breaths down into the very heart of the principal streets.
                  It respected no appearances, and no ranks, in its onward passage. It blasted every
                  object upon which it fell, quicker than does the fatal simoom of the cast.
                  Merchants of standing and wealth beheld their all consumed in a breath before
                  their eyes, and they helpless to prevent it. The British impressed their soldiers
                  and their sailors into the service of the firemen, who aided somewhat in saving a
                  few buildings and preventing the ravaging element from attacking their endangered
                  shipping. And it was only by the most courageous and unintermitted exertions that
                  the entire city did not prove to their entering army what Moscow did, so many
                  years later, to the overpowering French under Napoleon.</p>
               <p>In a low, one story wooden dwelling, a woman was eitting in her rocking chair. The
                  room was scantily furnished, and in this particular her personal attire was in
                  nowise inconsistent with the furniture. She had a peculiarly youthful look,
                  although care, and sadness, and manifest disappointment, had begun to engrave
                  their lines upon her well-developed forehead, and to sink her once well-rounded
                  and highly colored cheeks. There was a sweet expression sitting upon her
                  countenance, although it was always saddened; perhaps it was all the more sweet
                  for its very sadness. Her head leaned slightly upon her handâ€”a hand of singular
                  delicacy, and one betraying the remorselessness of some fate by which she had been
                  driven to the circumstances and situation in life in which we find her.</p>
               <p>She was rocking gently in her chair to and fro, and giving herself up to the
                  reverie in which her senses seemed to be enfolded. Not a shade of color was in her
                  cheeks, and no lustre played ever so faintly in her eyes. Her hand looked
                  veritably bloodless, even the large blue veins <unclear>refusing</unclear> to
                  discover themselves sufficiently to satisfy the beholder that the hand was not one
                  of Parian marble. It was near the middle of the afternoon.</p>
               <p>While she sat thus, dreaming and dreaming away the hours, the melancholy autumn
                  sun slanting its yellow rays through the outer blinds across her person and the
                  carpet on the floor, the door suddenly opened, and a strangely-wild-looking being
                  entered, bareheaded, his hair tangled about his forehead and over his eyes, and
                  those eyes gleaming with the strangest fires that ever lit up human or inhuman
                  expression. It was the son of the woman sitting before him. It was poor, young Tim
                  Flood.</p>
               <p>"Mother! mother!" shouted he, as he opened the door and saw her before him.</p>
               <p>"Sit down, my son," mildly urged the mother, beckoning him vainly to herself. "You
                  need to rest. Where have you been, Timothy, my son?"</p>
               <p>"But the spirits are all awake to-day!" exclaimed the lunatic, brushing his hand
                  hurriedly over his dishevelled hair and swinging his hat about gesticulatingly.
                  "Did you know the spirits are out, mother? They come from the sky! <emph>I</emph>
                  have seen them!â€”<emph>I</emph> have seen them spread their great white wings! They
                  are not far off now, mother. They will be here very soon. I know they will be
                  here, for I saw them flying like mad this way. Oh, what a glorious army of them
                  there were, too! They hid behind the great smokes that went before them, until
                  they thought I couldn't see them. And then they peered through the huge clouds
                  with their fierce bright eye, and laughed at me, and clapped their white
                  spirit-hands, and flapped their wings againâ€”and dashed on after me! They have
                  chased me home, mother! They drove me from street to street, all the way here.
                  They blew on me with their hot fire-breaths, till I almost sank down before them.
                  But I did not. I ran on and on, and shrieked at the top of my voice, while
                  everybody else was shrieking too; and I put my hands up over my face, that they
                  shouldn't come nigh me with their long, forked tongues! But they didn't catch
                  meâ€”no, no! not they! not they! I was too fleet for themâ€”I out-ran them! I
                     <emph>knew</emph> I should get home before they did; but they will be here
                  soon, mother; very soon; they will be sure to overtake us here!"</p>
               <p>"Poor, poor boy!" groaned the mother, her heart more deeply saddened at this
                  exhibition of her only child's impotence and folly. As she uttered the words, she
                  fetched a deep sigh, that seemed to have been an odor, or a frail breath, wafted
                  over the long and distant fields of memory, and redolent with every act, feeling
                  and sentiment that long ago grew thereon.</p>
               <p>"Do not sigh, mother," said the boy, "but help me to beat away the spirits when
                  they come to surround and seize me. Come, get up, mother, for they will very soon
                  be here. Up, up, mother! Can't you see them through the lattice? Can't you feel
                  their hot breaths already? Can't you hear their low and hissing whispers in your
                  ears? Come, my mother!" continued he, catching hold furiously of her
                  handâ€”"come!"</p>
               <p>"I see nothing but the sun, child," replied she, mildly, hoping by this means to
                  pacify him in a measure.</p>
               <p>"Oh, then if you will not come," said he, "if you will not come, then will I go to
                  the door alone and beat them back! Can I do it with my hands? Will they flee if I
                  do but look steadily at them? Will they turn pale, and flee from me? No, no; no,
                  no, no They are spirits of the airâ€”they come from Godâ€”they can't <emph>be</emph>
                  beaten backâ€”they will not be cowed awayâ€”they are too fierce for that! Their eyes
                  are like the stars in a midnight sky, only more, and fiercer, and brighter. I
                  never saw such eyes before. Their tongues are like the tongues of a million
                  serpents; every one of them is forked, and keeps playing all about in the air!
                  Come and see them, motherâ€”come, I beg you!"â€”and he ran back to where his parent
                  eat, determined in his frenzy to bear her to the door.</p>
               <p>"What makes you so excited today, my son?" asked she, herself becoming
                  considerably alarmed at his unaccountable manner.</p>
               <p>"Excited!" exclaimed he; "but the spirits would excite <emph>you,</emph> tooâ€”they
                  drive <emph>anybody</emph> mad! You cannot look into their eyes, but you will grow
                  mad yourself! They are so lurid, and their tongues look so thirsty, and their
                  faces are so deathly pale! Come to the door, mother!"</p>
               <p>"I cannot, my son," replied she. "I am not well enough. Go yourself, if you will
                  not sit down and stay with your mother one short hour. Go, my son, if you will
                  not."</p>
               <p>"But I can't stay here a short hourâ€”nobody can stay here that time!"</p>
               <p>"Why not?"</p>
               <p>"Because the fire-fiends will be hereâ€”they will come in and eat everything out of
                  the house! They will swallow all there is, house and all!</p>
               <p>"What mean you, my son? I do not understand you."</p>
               <p>"Then come but to the door with me."</p>
               <p>He looked inquiringly at her, but she gave a negative shake to her head, and he
                  repliedâ€”</p>
               <p>"Then I go aloneâ€”I'll go to the street alone! I <emph>dare</emph> all the
                  fire-devils to eat me up with their thousand tonguesâ€”I <emph>dare</emph> them to
                  look me through with their million fierce and bloody eyes! I <emph>defy</emph>
                  them to blow their hot breaths on me, so that my own free breath shall be stopped.
                  No, no, no! they cannot do itâ€”they cannot do it! not theyâ€”not they! I am much too
                  brave for them, my mother. I will go and meet them!"</p>
               <p>He started at once for the door. The sun had already become shadowed upon the
                  carpet, and none of its blessed gleams yet lay and nestled in the lap of<pb
                     n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6939-00000019"/> the saddened mother. He opened wide the
                  door and stood in it, gazing wildly up and down the court in which the house
                  stood. Then he looked upwards and began clapping his hands exultingly, and
                  laughing with a very maniac's laugh.</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! ha!" shouted he, 'they're coming down now, mother! They'll be on us soon!
                  They'll burst in through the door."</p>
               <p>"What is that noise, my son!" exclaimed the mother, moving excitedly in her
                  chair.</p>
               <p>"It's the spirits out of the air!" he responded, pointing wildly up towards them,
                  and laughing madly with the gesture. "The fire-fiends are come! I smell their
                  breath! I see their eyes! I can almost clutch their tongues, that they want so
                  much to run through my body!"</p>
               <p>The woman became alarmed with the dry and crackling sound, every moment growing
                  more loud and fearful, that fell on her ears. She rushed from her chair in frantic
                  haste to the door, and, leaning on the shoulder of her son, gazed with fearful
                  foreboding in the direction in which he pointed.</p>
               <p>"Gracious Heavens!" exclaimed she, in her feeble woman's voice, "<emph>it's
                     fire!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Didn't I say 'twas the fire-fiends?' asked her son, looking round into her face,
                  and beholding it, if possible, more perfectly livid than before. "Didn't I say the
                  fire-devils were coming, mother? Didn't I say they'd soon be in at the door, and
                  eat us all up with their great lapping tongues? Look, look! See how they twist
                  themselves together, like so many serpents, and open wide their hungry jaws, and
                  look fierce with their million eyes!"</p>
               <p>"Let us fly, my son!" cried the terrified woman, suddenly catching the echoes of
                  the confused clamor of the multitudes in the adjoining street.</p>
               <p>"Flee, mother? Yes: let us flee, let us go now! See, see! The devils are running
                  down the roof! They are in the court! They will soon be upon us! Quick, mother,
                  quick! You can't be too quick for them! Let us flee, where they cannot overtake us
                  again!"</p>
               <p>While the son stood in the door, employing defiant gestures in the face of the
                  flames, and counselling his mother to make all the haste within her power, she had
                  gone within, and with so much strength as still remained to her after her fright,
                  was engaged in gathering together what few articles she thought of most immediate
                  value to both of them, and packing them closely within the folds of an old red
                  shawl. She had scarcely time, however, to complete even this hurried preparation
                  for their safety and future comfort, before one of the roofs near by fell in,
                  driving upwards clouds of countless sparks and cinders, and sending an echo back
                  upon her ear that startled her.</p>
               <p>"Come, mother, come!" cried the boy, growing pale with his excitement. "Now's our
                  time to fly! The breath of the fiends is hot upon my cheek now! They will look me
                  through with their huge, fierce eyes! Come, mother, come!" and he immediately
                  extended one hand towards her, while with the other he kept beating back the
                  phantoms that danced before his eyes in the already close approaching flames.</p>
               <p>"My God! all is lost! We are houseless, my son!" exclaimed she, when she reached
                  the door and looked about her. "With me, my boy, with me! Take hold of this
                  bundle!"</p>
               <p>He seized hold of the bundle containing all their remaining earthly valuables, and
                  ran as fast as his weary parent's strength would suffer him. She heard the wild
                  shouts and shrieks of the people in the adjoining street, and her knees grew weak
                  beneath her body.</p>
               <p>"Which way?" asked she, on reaching the angle at the entrance of the court.</p>
               <p>"This, this way!" cried out her son, pointing frantically with his fingers in a
                  direction opposite the fires.</p>
               <p>They ran on for a long distance, never stopping to catch breath, or to rest, until
                  they had reached a point far removed from the scene of the conflagration. Here
                  they sat down upon a rock, and watched with palpitating hearts the heavy clouds of
                  black smoke, as they rolled away into the clear azure of the distant sky.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE INDIAN AND THE OUTLAW.</head>
               <p>It was quite nightfall when young William Howe, accompanied and assisted by the
                  faithful negro Buff, reached the house of his uncle not far removed from the
                  extremity of the little village street. The wound of the young man was as just
                  nothing at all, his only temporary hurt consisting in the sudden shock that had
                  produced his insensibility. From this, as already narrated, the negro's timely and
                  assiduous attentions had at length altogether succeeded in recovering him; and
                  leaning on the arm of the faithful attendant, he walked at a slow pace down the
                  path that led to the road below the declivity of the mountain.</p>
               <p>Nothing was said at the house of the young man's uncle respecting the trifling
                  accident, it having been agreed upon that such should be the management of the
                  affair. Buff was rampant that the "cussed Injun" should be punished for the
                  murderous wrong he had done his master, and the latter could only pacify him by
                  repeatedly assuring him that his punishment should be certain, even though it came
                  late. It should therefore be none the less severe.</p>
               <p>The young man accordingly went about the village to engage a couple of such
                  friends as he thought most valiant and trustworthy to promise him their
                  assistance, as soon as he should think it expedient to call upon them. He found no
                  difficulty in obtaining just such assistance as he stood most in need of, for two
                  more brave and honest hearted men than were Walter King and Harvey Brown, could be
                  found nowhere either within town or county lines. The time was left to be arranged
                  by William Howe alone, to whose hands was committed the entire project and
                  expedition. Everything was put in complete and instant readiness, however, by all
                  of them, that they might be able to move at an hour's notice. But just as the
                  youthful lover thought his enemy was within his powerâ€”for he had kept sight of him
                  for some time previousâ€”he received orders by post to join his company without
                  delay in New York. Thus he was reluctantly compelled to defer a project his heart
                  fairly burned to carry out. But still he had hope that he should not finally be
                  cheated of his promised victim.</p>
               <p>After he had taken a sad leave of the charming mountain-nymph, who lived with the
                  old witch, and bade farewell to his uncle and his kind housekeeper, who seemed
                  more like an aunt to him than like a housekeeper <emph>simply</emph>â€”no set out
                  through the eastern part of Westchester for head-quarters. Arrived there, he duly
                  reported himself to the proper officer, and was at once set upon such duly as for
                  the time it belonged to him to perform. He afterwards removed with General
                  Putnam's forces to the heights of Brooklyn, and engaged in the unfortunate battle
                  of the 27th of August, with as much ardor and bravery as any one in the American
                  ranks. He subsequently took an active part in the battles, or skirmishes, of the
                  15th and 16th of September, above King's Bridge, at which time he so greatly
                  distinguished himself beneath the eye of the commander-in-chief, that he was
                  forthwith raised from the rank of lieutenant, which he held at the time, to that
                  of captainâ€”a commission no one thought would ever stand the leest chance of being
                  disgraced. On the 28th of October, the day on which the battle was fought at White
                  Plains, his post was so distant from the scene of action that he was not able to
                  take a part in struggle in which his soul was none the less interested; but he
                  fired his comrades with new thoughts and braver resolutions, while he chafed so
                  openly in their presence to go and poor out his blood with the others, for the
                  good of their common country. After this time, he was withdrawn with his regiment
                  to a point somewhat in the rear of the battle ground.</p>
               <p>It was only in the early part of October, the same month with that of the battle
                  of White Plains, that a couple of men lay concealed in the little cabin situated a
                  mile or more from the hut of old Bet Miffles, in the middle of the afternoon. One
                  of them was the Indian who had taken aim at the person of Captain William Howe,
                  and the other was a lawless, thieving, vagabond wretch, whose name was Jim
                  Marshall For years before he had been a loose and vagrant character about the
                  village, subsisting nobody knew how, and living scarcely anybody knew where. One
                  day he would be seen hanging about the village in quest of work, and the next he
                  would be at least ten or a dozen miles away in another direction. He practised no
                  particular trade or calling and though abundantly known and firmly believed to be
                  a rogue, he had hitherto avoided the commission of any overt acts, such as would
                  be sufficient to convict him on any specific charge. Like all such rogues, he had
                  always studied to escape conviction, and with no mean success either. Nothing had
                  been known concerning him by the inhabitants of the village, for a long time
                  previous to the time when we find him with the reader, secreted in this place in
                  the forest; and many of the people began to think he had either gone off forever,
                  or that he must have met his death in some skirmish or quarrel of which they had
                  heard nothing. And the public memory had now quite dislodged him and his name.</p>
               <p>"Lariko," said Jim, as they sat there in the dark cabin, addressing the Indian;
                  "Lariko, we have met at a good time here. I have a plan in my head!"</p>
               <p>"Lariko have no plans. Lariko keep his own heart. Pale face be grown mighty strong
                  now, and poor Indian lose his heart!" responded the Indian.</p>
               <p>"Do you know the old witch on the mountain, Lariko?" asked the renegade.</p>
               <p>"Ugh!" responded the Indian.</p>
               <p>"And the young maiden that lives with her?â€”the beautiful girl?" persisted the
                  rover.</p>
               <p>"Young maiden is Manokeeâ€”young maiden is spring-flower for beauty!" replied the
                  Indian.</p>
               <p>"I want to take her from the lodge of the white woman," said he. "Will Lariko go
                  too and help me?"</p>
               <p>"Lariko never fail. Lariko's eye still clear. Lariko's ear still quick. Lariko go
                  where his pale brother say!"</p>
               <p>"Then come!" said the white man; "let us go now! The day will soon be down and we
                  need to have her in the forest early."</p>
               <p>The Indian sprang speedily to his feet, anxious to accompany the white upon the
                  route he had marked out. In an instant almost, they were on their way to the hut
                  of old Bet Miffles.</p>
               <p>They arrived before the door before long, and Marshall motioned to the Indian to
                  remain outside while he entered the hut alone. The Indian did as bidden. Marshall
                  raised the latch and entered the room. The old witch sat there herself, smoking
                  her pipe over a small fire she had just kindled, and Mary was reading not far from
                  her. Both looked up as Marshall entered, while the old woman took her pipe
                  hurriedly from her mouth, and said:</p>
               <p>"Jim Marshallâ€”the evil one's upon ye, that ye show your face here! I thought ye
                  was long dead!"</p>
               <p>"Not quite so easy as all that," rejoined he, coolly taking a vacant seat by the
                  side of the maiden, but not offering to remove the skin cap from his head. "I aint
                  dead <emph>yit,</emph> old woman. I'm good for a good many more winters."</p>
               <p>"If you dont git yer pay for what you've <emph>done,</emph> before that time,"
                  replied she, somewhat sharply.</p>
               <p>Never be afraid concernin' <emph>that!</emph>" said he. "But, Betty, how goes the
                  times with ye?"</p>
               <p>"The devil take ye tor a rascal and a coward, to come into my house while I am
                  alone and unprotected!" exclaimed she. "Why are ye here to-day?"</p>
               <p>"Don't fly into such a passion, woman," said he, "and all about nothing at all!
                  I've only come up to make ye a visit."</p>
               <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6939-00000020"/>
               <p>"And pray it may be a short one," replied she, puffing out the tobacco clouds
                  quite vigorously.</p>
               <p>"But why so? Have I ever done you any harm, Betty?" asked he.</p>
               <p>"No matter whether you have, or you havn't. It's nothing to what you might do if
                  you but thought you could."</p>
               <p>"I'll tell ye what 'tis, old woman," said he, his tone considerably changed, and
                  his syllables finding their way out much more slowly and with greater emphasis
                  than beforeâ€”" I've come to have a talk with you to-day about this gal of your'n.
                  She fills my eye exactly. I haint seen her equal nowhere. Now <emph>I</emph> want
                  to make a bargain with you for the price I shall pay you to let me carry her
                  off."</p>
               <p>"A murrain seize ye, you spawn of the devil!" ejaculated the old woman, her head
                  shaking to and fro a tempest of ungovernable rage, and her gray and grizzly hair
                  unfastening from its several places of confinement. "Jim Marshall, ye talk like a
                  madman! You don't know what you're about; the evil spirit is in ye to do the works
                  of hell! I say to you, ye had better <emph>leave</emph> meâ€”leave my butâ€”leave the
                  mountain altogether!"</p>
               <p>"But I love your little chick," protested he, laying his rough hand across her
                  arm, and then in his coarse manner chucking her under her chin.</p>
               <p>The maiden involuntarily drew back from his foul contact, disgusted with his
                  odious manner and appearance.</p>
               <p>"Not so shy, young miss," said he, patting her soft cheek into which the crimson
                  had suddenly forced itself, until her face seemed all a glow. "Not so coy, pretty
                  maid? I've loved you longâ€”I love you now! 'Faith, but you'd be a brave maid,
                  wouldn't ye, to grace a poor man's cabin? And I must have ye in mine, I
                  believe!"</p>
               <p>She made a still further effort to remove out of his reach, in which she proved
                  finally successful.</p>
               <p>"Why do ye come here, Jim Marshall," broke in the old witchâ€”" what is it ye want?
                  Can't ye let a lone body be in peace by herself, away from the world?"</p>
               <p>"I want your gal, woman," he replied with warmth. "Give me but her, and you shall
                  be paid your own price, and we will always be the best of friends."</p>
               <p>"Away with ye where ye came from!" uttered she. "You are a madman! I cannot let
                  the child go from my side. I should be lonely and die!"</p>
               <p>"Keeping her for that young rebel Howe, I cal'-late?" replied he, sarcastically.
                  "Rather give her up to <emph>that</emph> scapegoat than to me? Oh yes, I see it
                  all; I know what it means; but I swear, old woman, that <emph>it shall not be
                     so!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Never fear for thatâ€”never fear!" said she.</p>
               <p>"Why needn't I fear, when I see what I do see, every time he comes back to the
                  village? Who walks with her, talks with her, laughs with her, sits with her into
                  the twilight hour, but he? Whom does she love but <emph>him?</emph> Who will have
                  her but he?"</p>
               <p>All this time the face of the maiden assumed a color of more deeply burning
                  crimson, and her vexed heart palpitated tumultuously with a contrariety of
                  emotions. But she preserved a rigid silence, looking steadfastly down upon the
                  floor.</p>
               <p>"Away with ye, Jim Marshall. The young man cannot have the girl for his wife. It
                  is ordained otherwise. He cannot have her. It isn't possible! Providence has
                  arranged differently."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Marshall, "that <emph>I</emph> should carry her off with
                     <emph>me,</emph> where he cannot get her, true enough.'</p>
               <p>"You lie! She will stay with me! She will not leave the hut where lives her
                  grandmother. Think ye, ye have power enough to take her away?"</p>
               <p>"Unless you are the evil one himself, as they say you are. I have," he replied.
                  "But never be afraid but what I shall do what I begin. I must take the girl along
                  with me, so make no words about it, but get Ler ready and say your prayers to her
                  as soon as ye can, for I'm in a hurry. She must go along with me!"</p>
               <p>As he uttered these portentous words, that fell upon the ears of Mary like the
                  knell of her certain doom, he rose to his feet and gave a long and shrill whistle,
                  by applying his fingers to his mouth.</p>
               <p>The old woman, on seeing this movement of his, and hearing this almost deafening
                  evidence that he must be leagued with others, suddenly rose from her chair and
                  fell to clapping her hands most energetically. On this instant, the old black cat,
                  who sat crouching upon the top of the antique clock, and whose eyes had for some
                  time during the interview been like two flaming balls of fire, sprang with a
                  single bound from her perch, and with a demoniac yell and frightful hiss, deeply
                  imbedded her long and glistening claws in the cheek and throat of the bold
                  intruder, just as he had laid hold of the person of Mary to carry her away. The
                  old woman kept up her shouts and gestures of encouragement, and the enraged brute
                  kept up her unearthly howls and hisses, and her horrible torture.</p>
               <p>It was more than the man was able to stand. He was rent, first with unspeakable
                  surprise, and then with smarting pain. Letting go the hold he had upon the girl,
                  he raised his hands in the most agonizing and horror-stricken manner, and cried at
                  the top of his voice.</p>
               <p>"Hell, and all its fiends let loose! Bloody murder will ye do to me!
                     murâ€”â€”<emph>der!</emph> Ten thousand devils. Help, help! Take 'em off, take 'em
                  off! The devils have got me! The devils are on me! They wo'nt let me go! You old
                  hell-hag, take your devils offâ€”"</p>
               <p>"Will ye leave me unmolested, then?" broke in the old woman, determined not to
                  relinquish the business until it was entirely and satisfactorily performed.</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, yes! I'll leave ye forever! I'll never come near any of ye more! Only
                  call off your devils, only stop their infernal howls! Only rid my ears of their
                  hissings and spittings! Away with 'em, take 'em off. They're diggin' my
                     <emph>heart</emph> out of me now. My life 'ill soon be gone. Take the devils
                  off. Take 'em off!"</p>
               <p>"Do ye promise, then?" persisted the old woman.</p>
               <p>"To leave you? yes: I promise it a thousand times in one breath."</p>
               <p>"And never come back again?"</p>
               <p>"Noâ€”noâ€”no. Take off this black devil! She's having my life out of me!"</p>
               <p>"Then Kip, Kip, come off, come here," called the old witch to her infuriated
                  cat.</p>
               <p>Just as she had issued her order to the brute. Marshall had opened the door, where
                  he still stood. The Indian saw him in this strange predicament, his face and neck
                  covered with blood, and the fierce looking black cat fastened like fate upon him.
                  Being of a superstitious character himself, he had no sooner caught an
                  unmistakeable glimpse of the apparition, and heard the wild sounds the infuriated
                  brute produced, than he took to his heels and was soon far out of sight and
                  hearing in the heart of the sheltering forest. Marshall followed on as closely as
                  the smarting sense of his wounds would suffer him, which acted much as, it may be
                  supposed, the sting of a well-driven spur acts upon the flanks of a steed. Taking
                  long and giant strides from the front of the hut door he buried himself from the
                  power of human penetration in an incredibly short space of time.</p>
               <p>It was not long after this occurrenceâ€”it being only early in Novemberâ€”when, as the
                  troops about the Hudson anticipated no surprises or attacks from the enemy during
                  at least the coming months of the winter, Captain Howe obtained a furlough of
                  sufficient length to enable him to visit his uncle's house and carry out secretly
                  a project that had long been working in his busy brain. As a matter of course, he
                  had not long been domiciled with his benevolent relativeâ€”sometimes a churlish old
                  gentleman, at the bestâ€”before he found the occasion to make a visit to the
                  mountain. His uncle hung on hard to have him tell more particulars of the
                  skirmishes on that side of New York, as well as of the battles of Long Island and
                  White Plains; but the youthful Captain's invention was ready for abundant excuses
                  for a short absence in the woods, now that the squirrel hunting season had exactly
                  come, and his assurance offered him abundant words with which to reiterate the
                  firmest and fairest promises to the old gentleman respecting what the certainly
                  would do when he came back.</p>
               <p>He got off one afternoon, in company with the faithful negro Buff, and it was
                  preconcerted that the other two menâ€”Walter King and Harvey Brownâ€”should meet them
                  at an appointed rendezvous beyond the village. All their preliminary arrangements
                  worked to their satisfaction. They met as agreed; and now the question arose,
                  'which way shall we go to share our prey?' The Captain had heard from the lips of
                  his beloved maiden every particular of the transaction of the hut so shortly
                  previous; and his heart burned with mingled rage and a desire to revenge the
                  insult and wrong of which the innocent Mary had been the recipient.</p>
               <p>"Then that Jim Marshallâ€”that infernal toryâ€”is at the bottom of all this," said he
                  to himself, "and he was undoubtedly the man who put up that vagabond Indian to
                  fire upon me last summer! Yes, Yes! I think I see it all. But, Jim Marshall, keep
                  a very good lookout for yourself, or you may suddenly fall in with a party you are
                  not in daily expectation of seeing.!"</p>
               <p>Such were his thoughts and feelings at the moment when his comrades proposed the
                  inquiry, 'which way shall we go first?' They all walked on in silence, however,
                  for some distance, without either of them suggesting an answer to the same, and
                  each busy with his own reflections, until they suddenly discovered that they had
                  gone far up the mountain and quite into the forest. Looking about them in apparent
                  listlessness, for the first time since they started they seemed to recognize the
                  fruitlessness of their task in the present manner in which they had set out upon
                  it.</p>
               <p>After a brief practical consultation, in which no one of themâ€”not even old
                  Buffâ€”went unrepresented, Captain Howe proposed to the others that he and the negro
                  should take a circuitous path in the right hand direction, and the other two men a
                  route that lay open to them on their left. This was at once concluded upon, the
                  time of separation from each other settled, and the call or shout of recognition
                  determined. They then struck off upon their separate ways, full of hopeâ€”and hope
                  onlyâ€”that their expedition might not prove altogether fruitless.</p>
               <p>The young man, with his black companion, had travelled on almost in an
                  uninterrupted silence for a great distance, when they halted and listened. The
                  still forest, however, gave out no sounds, no voices, no echoes, save those made
                  by the crush of some falling tree-bough, or the sudden flight of a large bird, or
                  the distant bark of some fox that had wandered far from his hole. They sat
                  themselves down upon a rock close at hand, in the front of which was a thick
                  growth of spruce and hemlock, which concealed quite everything from their view. It
                  appeared to be generally rocky all about them. They had sat in this spot but a few
                  minutes, during which time neither of them had spoken a word, when Buff suddenly
                  started up a little and exclaimed in a loud whisper to his young masterâ€”</p>
               <p>"There, there! What's that? Didn't massa Billy hear um?"</p>
               <p>"What's <emph>what?</emph>" asked Captain Howe, pricking up his ears quickly, and
                  looking all about him for the purpose of catching any the most trifling echo.
                     "<emph>I</emph> hear nothing, Buff. "What do <emph>you</emph> hear? What is it,
                  Buff?"</p>
               <p>"Me hear voices," replied the negro.</p>
               <p>"Voices! Where?"</p>
               <p>"Don't know dat yit, massa Billy; but sure Buff hear em voices
                     <emph>somewhere.</emph> I sh'd tink dey was over yender," said he, pointing in
                  the direction in which he thought them to be.</p>
               <p>The young captain instantly regained his feet, upon this trifling suggestion from
                  the negro, and, catching hold of the outspreading branches of the hemlocks that
                  grew next him, walked onwards a few feet. His<pb n="40-41"
                     xml:id="VAC6939-00000021"/> astonishment was unbounded on finding that he had
                  suddenly come upon the edge of a large shelving rock, and that beneath his feet
                  yawned quite a formidable precipice. Not knowing what sort of concealment such a
                  place might afford for renegades and thieves, he determined to stand still where
                  he was and await any further demonstrations that might offer itself of the
                  presence of such characters. He had remained in his new position, however, not
                  more than two or three minutes, when he distinctly heard with his own ears the
                  sound of voices. He listened with all his eager earnestness, if possible to
                  undeceive himself of his first impressions; but there still swelled up to him from
                  below the same low sound of human tongues. Full of curiosity, and freshly fired
                  with his desire of revenge, he dropped down on his knees, and, holding on tightly
                  by one of the boughs, extended his bodyâ€”a portion of itâ€”ar over the edge of the
                  moss-stained cliff. In this position he kept his eyes and ears all about him.</p>
               <p>"See anybody, massa!" inquired the negro, in a loud whisper, that sounded
                  exceedingly husky and hollow.</p>
               <p>But the young man made no reply while in that position, even if the negro had
                  expected such a thing to be done. He continued looking steadily for some time,
                  until by the sudden lighting up of his eyes and the mounting of the hot blood to
                  his cheeks, it was plain that the discovery he was bent upon had been finally
                  made. Thereâ€”true enoughâ€”he caught sight of two human figures. At first, he thought
                  they might be those of his own companions, who had strayed thither, hardly knowing
                  in what direction they were going; but upon a closer and more considerate
                  examination, he found that they were not the men who had started from the village
                  with him. He looked again, parting the small twigs from before his face, and
                  stretching himself still further over. He could no longer be mistaken. They were
                  the objects of his pursuit. They were none other than the outlaw, Jim Marshall,
                  and his companion, the Indian!</p>
               <p>Captain Howe satisfied himself that they were fast seated in their present place
                  of security, and then crept back to the side of the negro. The large eyes of the
                  latter grew immoderately larger, as the Captain narrated to him the particulars of
                  his discovery, and he could scarcely be kept back from rushing to the edge of the
                  cliff and discharging his musket at them He was informed, however that such a
                  course would only ruin the whole plan, and induced to give over his sudden and
                  passionate purpose. Still his black fingers kept busily working with his gunlock,
                  and his eyes kept ferociously glancing at the edge of the cliff. The Captain led
                  him off hurriedly to the rear, and ordered him to follow him on closely. Then he
                  rapidly struck a line into the woods.</p>
               <p>His plan was, to hurry on as fast as he could until he should intersect the path
                  his companions had taken, in the hopes of cutting them off at some point they
                  might not yet have reached, and communicating to them his discovery. He dared not
                  fire his gun as a signal for them, for then all might be overthrown; the bird
                  would undoubtedly take warning from the alarm, and escape would be the more easy.
                  Accordingly he waited patiently for some half an hour, hoping the others would
                  come up. But he was disappointed. He heard nothing of their advancing; he
                  discovered no traces of their having gone on, either.</p>
               <p>"Come on, then, Buff!' said he to the negro; "examine your priming, that your
                  musket don't fail you in case of need, and come along!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, he be all right," returned Buff. "Ole-musket never fail Buff. He know he too
                  well. He too sureâ€”he fired him too many time."</p>
               <p>"Follow me, then," said the captain, "and keep your eyes about you."</p>
               <p>"Yes, massa, yes. Goin' to shoot 'em, massa? Tell old Buff put his gun guts 'trait
                  troo dat Injun?"</p>
               <p>"That I can better tell you when I get to where they are," said he. "Only do as I
                  orderâ€”follow me closelyâ€”keep your eyes openâ€”and I reckon we shall catch the
                  villain. I don't care whether we shoot the Indian or not, so we do but take that
                  infernal tory of a Jim Marshall alive! <emph>That's</emph> all I want to do
                  today."</p>
               <p>"Den I guess we do um," said Buff.</p>
               <p>They started back towards the ledge. Much time had already elapsed, as the Captain
                  knew, since he had left the place, and his misgivings were neither few nor
                  trifling that he might not find either of his objects of pursuit just where he had
                  left them; but still he kept-onward with a stout heart, his resolution even and
                  anon flaming up within him, that, dead or alive, the man who had sought to wrong
                  Mary so foully should be made a captive. He exchanged but few words with the negro
                  as they went along, and the latter fell silently into the rear, expecting nothing
                  from his master's lips, but intently watching for any signs of the proximity of
                  human beings that the thick growth of woods might be able to furnish.</p>
               <p>"We must get on faster, Buff," ordered the Captain, mending his pace. The long,
                  gray shadows of evening had begun to extend themselves through the November woods,
                  and he was reminded of the now rapid approach of nightfall. Occasionally he
                  tripped and stumbled over the rocks and stumps that beset his path, the light
                  being insufficient to discover them in season to him. Through covert and tangled
                  brake, over rocks and ledges, he kept steadily on his course, his eyes fast set
                  upon only one object, and that object the exact point, or locality, where he was
                  expecting to find the villains he was in such resolute pursuit of.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE CAPTURE AND CONFINEMENT.</head>
               <p>"Los' de way, massa Billy?" asked old Buff, after they had continued upon their
                  journey for some distance, and at the moment when Captain Howe came to a momentary
                  halt; "tink you know um agin? Tink you find um where dey be?"</p>
               <p>"I have but little fears about that," replied he, willing to exchange a word with
                  the negro, though he felt never so little inclined to utter a syllable.</p>
               <p>"Better let Buff fire he ole musket at um, when he say so? Den <emph>one</emph> of
                  um be <emph>sure</emph> to be dead! Guess you miss it dat time, massa! Buff sure
                  to kill um, only let he fire!"</p>
               <p>"But that wasn't what I was after, Buff," replied the Captain. "It is my desire to
                  take the fellows alive, if possible, and administer to that Jim Marshall such a
                  punishment as I think will do him good. I've no desire to <emph>kill</emph> him,
                  and if you had discharged your gun at him, the whole object in this present
                  expedition of ours would have been frustrated. It was on that account that I
                  ordered you not to fire at theâ€”"</p>
               <p>"All right, massa Billy! All right enough, Buff tink. Buff neber do nothin' what
                  massa Billy say he not do. Buff neber kick down massa Billy's plans."</p>
               <p>"My <emph>present</emph> plan is, Buff," said the young Captain, "to go near
                  enough to those fellows I saw hid below the rock, and take them prisoners"</p>
               <p>"How you do um, massa Billy? How you go to work to do um? Dey fire, and shoot us
                  down afore we say hold on!' Dey make dead folks ob us afore we see um!
                     <emph>How</emph> you catch um, massa Billy?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>How</emph> will I do it?"</p>
               <p>"Yas, yas; <emph>how</emph> you do it, massa Billy? Jes' say <emph>how</emph> he
                  be done, an' Buff no lag behind massa Billy to seize hold ob um."</p>
               <p>"Why, I shall order them to surrender," replied the young commander.</p>
               <p>"Den 'spose dey no surrender?" asked Buff.</p>
               <p>"Then I shall shoot them; that is, if you will help me, and not turn and run
                  away."</p>
               <p>There was a look, half of anger and half of mortified pride, that momentarily
                  crossed the sable countenance of the negro, and had he been of a white complexton,
                  the blood that rushed so impetuously to his cheeks, and mounted in such hot fury
                  to his forehead, would have abundantly attested the depth of his feeling. He only
                  replied to this latter insinuation of his master by turning upon him a look of
                  inexpressible astonishment, and muttering aloud, loud enough to be heard by
                  him,</p>
               <p>"Me turn and run. Did eber Cap'n Billy <emph>hear</emph> the thing? Did eber Cap'n
                  Billy <emph>s'pect</emph> dat Buff be good-for-notin' coward? If he 'pend on Buff
                  to shoot the Injin, den de Injin's jes' as good as a dead Injin dis-berry minnit.
                  But den; Massy Billy," continued he, his face greatly brightening, "but den,
                  s'pose dey see us fust? S'pose dey draw trigger fust, and shoot us? How Cap'n
                  Billy take um den?"</p>
               <p>It staggered the young man to produce just such an answer to this question as
                  should both satisfy the imaginations of the negro, and at the same time keep good
                  that resolute courage he believed at that moment his. But he succeeded, as he
                  thought, in the attempt, through the exact character, or form, of his reply he was
                  unable to recollect again only a minute or two afterwards.</p>
               <p>They had by this time come within so short a distance of the place where William
                  Howe supposed the concealed men to lie, that the latter motioned with his hand for
                  Buff to cease all efforts at conversation, and follow closely on behind him in
                  silence. This injunction was readily observed by the negro, and at once obeyed. He
                  fell into the rear, but kept his lony fingers still busily playing with his
                  gun-lock, and his large, white eyes, glaring fiercely all about him. The shadows
                  began to shed themselves now more thickly upon the earth and all through the
                  woods, and there was need that every faculty they each of them possessed be put in
                  requisition.</p>
               <p>Softly, and far more slowly, then, they began to creep along now, dodging and
                  skulking, and peeping about the bushes, pushing the small boughs and twigs aside
                  for a better prospect, stopping ever and anon to listen and catch any the
                  slightest sounds, and then penetrating again the clumps of thickets that almost
                  seemed to bewilder them. The negro said not a word, but kept close on after his
                  young master.</p>
               <p>Presently he felt the touch of the young man's hand upon his arm. It was laid at
                  first lightly upon it, and then it settled down heavily, and finally it took hold
                  with an almost convulsive clutch. The black instantly looked into his master's
                  face for an interpretation of this peculiar gesture, and readily found it in the
                  contortions the young Captain's face was at that moment undergoing. It seemed to
                  say to him, louder than any words, and plainer than any gesturesâ€”which in that
                  position might have been peculiarly unfortunateâ€”</p>
               <p>"Do you see there? Look where my eyes lookâ€”follow my eyes with yoursâ€”look yonder!
                  See that man yonderâ€”he is aloneâ€”he doesn't see us yet; but be careful not to make
                  the slightest motionâ€”be careful not to utter the slightest sound by which he may
                  discover us! Do you see him! Then keep your eyes on himâ€”only on <emph>him!</emph>
                  Remember your musket, and see his lying on the ground by his side! Now do just as
                  I do, and be careful that he doesn't get a chance to fire first!"</p>
               <p>The negro's eyes grew perceptibly whiter and larger at seeing the object to which
                  the Captain had thus quietly, but none the less effectively, directed his
                  attention, and his well-set teeth showed themselves to surpassing advantage. He
                  ground them together as savagely as if he could have gnawed in twain one of the
                  stoutest tree buts that stood near him</p>
               <p>The Captain slowly raised his musket to his shoulder, and deliberately took a
                  sight. The faithful negro, nothing daunted, did the same. For a few seconds both
                  stood in this position, moving not a foot or a muscle, but gazing steadfastly into
                  the face of the infamous outlaw who sat upon the ground beneath the ledge. His
                  face was yet deeply marked with the evidences of the conflict he had with the old
                  black cat of the witch, and he was idly plucking with one of his hands the small
                  tufts of grass that grew around the spot where he sat. As yet he was all unaware
                  of the presence of any one. The Indian, it appeared, left<pb n="42-43"
                     xml:id="VAC6939-00000022"/> him while Captain Howe and his companion were gone
                  to attempt finding the remaining two of their party, and he sat there apparently
                  awaiting his return. He was looking down upon the ground, and the expression of
                  his countenance was sullen and disturbed.</p>
               <p>Suddenly Captain Howe advanced with a determined tread upon him, cracking the dry
                  sticks and brush that lay in his path, and shouting almost at the top of his
                  voiceâ€”</p>
               <p>"Move a foot, and you die! Stir but a hair, and I'll shoot you down like a brute
                  as you are!"</p>
               <p>The outlaw looked suddenly up from out eyes glaring with ferocious excitement, and
                  seeing two men standing so near him, with loaded muskets deliberately levelled at
                  him, involuntarily seized his own that lay idly by him, and brought it part way to
                  his shoulder.</p>
               <p>"Raise that musket another inch," shouted Captain Howe, "and you're a dead man!
                  I've no more words for you now! you move only at your peril!"</p>
               <p>The bewildered man, set upon so unexpectedly and by a superior force, too, saw
                  that he was in the power of the speaker, almost at the first glance he threw upon
                  him. But he rose unconsciously to his feet, still clutching his musket with a
                  deadly grasp, as if he had every reason to feel that that alone could save him in
                  his emergency, as it undoubtedly had saved him many a time before. But the young
                  man never lost the deadly aim with which he had first taken the advantage of his
                  enemy, and the negro stood, ready to double the charge, in case the first gun
                  should not answer the purpose. Marshall saw at once that if he fired and brought
                  down oneâ€”even allowing that he was agile enough to do it before he should receive
                  a charge himselfâ€”the other stood ready to mete out to him a fearful retribution;
                  and he gave up his project at once, as being every way impracticable. Accordingly,
                  he dropped it at his side, and looked steadily and demurely at his captor.</p>
               <p>"Give up your gun to Buff!" ordered Captain Howe. "Buff, go take, his gun from
                  him!"</p>
               <p>The negro bestowed a fierce look upon the outlaw, and slrode rapidly up to him.
                  Just as he reached him, however, the latter saw that Buff had been so thoughtless
                  as to interpose his person partially between himself and the young Captain; and
                  knowing that Captain Howe would not then dare fire, through fear of killing his
                  own best friend, quicker than the flash of a running flame, he raised his musket
                  to his eye, and fired. The ball went whizzing with a murderously cruel sound past
                  the head of the young man, but he stood unhurt.</p>
               <p>"Knock the wretch down, Buff!" cried he to the negro; "knock him down Seize him by
                  the throat! Where are your cords? Where are your cords Buff?"</p>
               <p>The black stopped not for forther ceremony, not to answer the questions he did not
                  then hear; but throwing his gun without the reach of the villain, he advanced like
                  a very tiger upon him, and in an instant had thrown him heavily to the ground, and
                  was lying across him. The prisoner attempted to kick, and bite, and scratch the
                  black upon him, but the latter seemed at all points armed to meet just such an
                  adversary. At length he laid his long and bony fingers across his throat, and
                  commenced the vice-like operation of which they were eminently capable.</p>
               <p>"Guess he shoot massa Billy <emph>now!</emph>" grunted Buff, still continuing the
                  working of the vice, and glaring with an almost inhuman ferocity into his victim's
                  face. That face was suddenly become almost as black as that of his tormentor. The
                  eyes protruded hideously, and the tongue lolled a long way beyond its accustomed
                  limit. He was struggling vainly to speak, and his efforts were expanding
                  themselves in a series of the most frightful internal sounds that Buff had ever
                  heard. His master, who had been busily rummaging his own pocket for the cord he
                  considerately brought along with him, heard the strange not ses, and seeing to
                  what a pitch his zealous servant was engaged in carrying matters in his behalf, in
                  stantly ordered him to desist and allow the man at least a chance for breath.</p>
               <p>"Yes, but, massa," replied the exasperated negro, "how much chance for breff tink
                  he gib <emph>you?</emph> Yesâ€”yes; it be very good for dis old tory to breathe, but
                  he never tink massa Cap'n want breff too!"</p>
               <p>"Never mind that now," replied Captain Howe, pacifyingly. "He will be sure to get
                  his punishment now, for I don't see where there's any help for him. Let him have
                  breath enough to keep him alive. We shall want him to <emph>live,</emph> Buff, in
                  order that we may punish him. If he is dead, we can't do it."</p>
               <p>"Bery well! bery well, den! Jes' as massa Billy say. But ole Buff mighty sure dat
                  dis villain never deserve to hab no breff agin!"</p>
               <p>The Captain stooped down over the prostrate form of the outlaw, and told Buff to
                  give him his hands These he tied firmly together before him at the elbows, and
                  afterwards at the wrist; and then he told Buff to get off of him and help him to
                  his feet.</p>
               <p>"What have I ever done to you, Captain Howe," broke out the outlaw, his strength
                  greatly exhausted and his breathing deep and hardâ€”"what have I ever done to you
                  that you should come on me in this wayâ€”will you tell me?"</p>
               <p>"Jim Marshall!" spake the young officer, turning and looking him fully in the
                  face," if you do not yourself know why you are this day my prisoner, you certainly
                  need not be told of the reason by me! This is only a deceit of your own, which you
                  vainly think to practise upon me. You <emph>must</emph> know why I have thus
                  treated you! You do know, and do not think to deceive me by saving that you do
                  not! Have you so soon forgotten your going to the hut of the old hag, to get away
                  that girl by force?"</p>
               <p>"Is that anything to <emph>you?</emph>" asked Marshall.</p>
               <p>"It is much to me; it is <emph>everything</emph> to me," answered the Captain.</p>
               <p>"But the old woman says you can't have her; andâ€”â€”"</p>
               <p>"You, I conclude, have sworn the same thing, too!" The outlaw made no reply.</p>
               <p>"No matter whether you have or not; your presence there only a few weeks ago was
                  cause enough for my present feeling towards you. You have not forgotten it, I see.
                  Let us see if you have forgotten another thing, too? Who fired a rifle ball at my
                  head only last summer? Tell me <emph>that!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Before God, but 'twasn't me that did it!" exclaimed the man.</p>
               <p>"Noâ€”no, it was <emph>not</emph> you!" replied the Captain, slowly and with a
                  peculiar emphasis.</p>
               <p>"But I assure you by all that's holy, Cap'n Howe, I never fired a ball at your
                  head."</p>
               <p>"He lie! He lie brack lies!" shouted Buff, lustily.</p>
               <p>"He fire at massa Billy's head on'y jes' now! He lie! He lie!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, you have but a few minutes ago discharged your musket, loaded with ball, at
                  me Now how can I know that it was not your gun that was levelled at me while I sat
                  upon that stump in the woods, last summer?"</p>
               <p>The outlaw was sullen and silent.</p>
               <p>"But I do not charge you with that. I know who it was that did it. It was not your
                  hands that held that musket!"</p>
               <p>The prisoner looked strange, and alarmed more than ever.</p>
               <p>"It was <emph>by your order,</emph> however, that it was done, Jim Marshall!"
                  continued he. "It was you who urged a cruel Indian to the deed, more ignorant, and
                  therefore less responsible than yourself! <emph>He</emph> fired the musket, and
                  you had already set your price for my scalp! Was it not so, Jim Marshall? If you
                  are innocent of that charge, nothing is easier than for you to prove it."</p>
               <p>The Captain gave his prisoner an opportunity to clear himself, if he could, of the
                  charge; but the latter chose to make no attempt at vindication; he doggedly
                  refused to open his head in reply to anything his captor had to say upon the
                  subject.</p>
               <p>"Come along, then," said he. "Buff, load your musket and bring his along too. Keep
                  in the rear, and have your gun ready at a minute's warning!"</p>
               <p>"Cap'n Howe," said the prisoner, now breaking the silence he had so sedulously
                  observed respecting the interrogatories of his captorâ€”"Cap'n Howe, where are you
                  join' to take me?"</p>
               <p>"Where you will be safe from doing more harm," replied the young man, firmly.</p>
               <p>"And where is that, I would know?"</p>
               <p>"That you will know when we reach the place.</p>
               <p>"And not before?"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"Cap'n Howe," continued the prisoner, "you may shoot me down in my tracks like a
                  dog; you may take my head and fasten it to the highest tree-top there is in all
                  this forest; but do not, for God's sake! do not carry me back into the village!
                  Death is better than that? <emph>Anything</emph> is better than that! I
                     <emph>never'll</emph> go down this mountain into the village yonder! I'll die
                  fust? I'll destroy my own self fust!"</p>
               <p>"Undoubtedly you feel your guilt and your shame," replied Captain Howe; "but how
                  am I accountable for that? I brought it not upon you. It is all your own wrong
                  doing. You must pay the penalty of your wrongs yourself. I shall not aid in
                  screening you!"</p>
               <p>"Then I shall go into the village?" asked Marshall.</p>
               <p>"Without a doubt you will," replied the Captain.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the prisoner set up such a wild, unearthly yell, gathering suddenly what
                  breath and strength he could to give it propulsive force, that the old woods rung
                  to their innermost depths with the echoes. It was really a fearful cry, and made
                  the blood curdle in the veins of the young man who claimed for the moment to be
                  his keeper and captor.</p>
               <p>"Do that again, and you'll have a gag in your throat!" said the Captain, stepping
                  closer to him and looking him fiercely in the eye. "Do you hear me? If you will be
                  more comfortable in your journey with your throat plugged up, then just yell in
                  that way again! You may succeed in calling back the Indian to your side; but I
                  hardly think he'll venture very near you to-night. He's too watchful for that. He
                  knows too well what dangers are upon his path. So no more of your yells Come on,
                  Buff! Keep everything right? It's growing dark, and we must get out of these woods
                  as soon as we can. We had best reach the clearing by the old witch's but at
                  once!"</p>
               <p>On they started, therefore, at once; Captain Howe walking a very little in advance
                  of his prisoners, and the negro, now inflated with pride at the success of their
                  expedition, following close on behind, carrying a couple of muskets as best he
                  might in his hands. By crooked and circutious routes they at length succeeded in
                  reaching the clearing but a little way from the hut of the old witch. For a moment
                  they halted here. The young man appeared in doubt as to the better course for him
                  to pursue. The shades of night were fast closing upon him, and it must inevitably
                  be quite dark before he could safely gain the foot of the mountain-side with his
                  prisoner. In that journey down, too, he knew not what help might accidentally
                  overtake the outlaw, now so securely his. He was ignorant how many were banded
                  with him in his lawlessness and iniquity, and he was quite as certain that the
                  Indian could not be so far off as not to have heard the fearful yell of his
                  comrade. His resolution, therefore, was soon taken. He determined to go direct
                  with his prisoner to the hut of the old witch, and claim the use of part of her
                  apartment for the safe keeping of him through the night.</p>
               <p>"What do ye bring your renegades here for?" snarled out old Bet Miffles, when she
                  turned herself about from over her scanty fire and regarded the appearance of the
                  party that had just entered the room. "Aint there devils enough about without
                  seekin' to stir up another?"</p>
               <p>The young girl only raised her eyes to see that it was the form of her lover who
                  had entered with the rest, and the color instantly flew to her cheek, and hear
                  heart commence beating tumultuously; but she ventured not any word of recognition
                  for his ears.</p>
               <p>"I've brought this scoundrel here to-night," replied<pb n="44-45"
                     xml:id="VAC6939-00000023"/> the young man, "to keep him safely until the
                  morning. I cannot get him down to the village to-night."</p>
               <p>"And do ye take my hut for a prison house? Can't a poor lone body go even into the
                     <emph>mountains,</emph> but what she must be driven up as close as ever by
                  outlaws, and officers? I say, Cap'n William Howe, you can't keep your prisoner
                  hereâ€”there's no place for himâ€”he'll get loose! He'll set fireâ€”he'll destroy all
                  I've got! He can't stay!"</p>
               <p>"But it's impossible to get him in safety to the village to-night," protested
                  William, "and it's just as important that he be kept safe till morning. I don't
                  see any other way than for us to stay here. Mary," said he, addressing himself to
                  her, "can I have your room for him?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, certainly," answered she, gladly. "Certainly you can have it."</p>
               <p>"But what'll you do for sleep? The child must git her sleep!" interrupted the old
                  woman.</p>
               <p>"Me! I'll sit up in this large chair," replied the maiden, glad to think of any
                  mode in which she might gratify her lover in his present extremity. "I'll sit and
                  sleep in <emph>this chair,</emph> grandmother," said she.</p>
               <p>"And I in bed? No, no, noâ€”that would never do! Would Mr. Howe drive you out of yer
                  room?"</p>
               <p>"I seek to do no such thing, woman," said Captain Howe, a little vexed with the
                  needless talk he though there was being made over the matter. "Mary has
                  voluntarily relinquished her room for an important purpose, to-night, and, with
                  her permission still, I shall occupy it with my prisoner. If you have any
                  objections, they must be removed the best way you can do it. This man must stay
                  here, and here is the only safe place for him."</p>
               <p>William said this with an air and tone of such unmistakeable determination, that
                  the old witch felt strangely nettled at it. She could not yet see how
                     <emph>any</emph> circumstances could be either so peculiar, or so important, as
                  to justify a person in taking absolute possession of the premises of another. So
                  she replied to the young man, in a taunting toneâ€”</p>
               <p>"<emph>This is</emph> what comes o' your bein' allowed to sit and talk unmolested
                  with the girl, when the old grandmother's back is turned! <emph>This</emph> is
                  what comes on't!"</p>
               <p>"Grandmother!" repeated William, contemptuously.</p>
               <p>He might have been about to say more, which, if said, would undoubtedly have
                  precipitated matters for him beyond the reach of final redemption; but the
                  delicate hand of the young girl was instantly upon his lips, and instead of giving
                  expression to his thoughts, just then excessively turbulent, he only expended the
                  pent-up power of his lips in affectionately kissing the tips of her fingers.</p>
               <p>"I'll see if I can't find a place for me," continued the old woman, "where I
                  shan't be molested day and night, summer and winter, by anybody that's a mind to
                  come in! I want to git away from the world, and the world won't keep away from the
                  world, and the world won't keep away from meâ€”I go, and they foller! There's no
                  rest for me, I verily believe!"</p>
               <p>"There's no earthly use, woman," said the young man, "in your running on in this
                  senseless way, and all about nothing. I have not pursued you nor hunted you down;
                  on the contrary! I am only asking of you a simple favor; just such an one as any
                  one in your situation would be willing to grant me. And remember, it is not
                  altogether a favor done <emph>me</emph> alone; it's just as much for yourself as
                  for me. You have not probably forgotten so soon the treatment you received from
                  this same villain, only a short time ago. I is to punish him for that, as well as
                  for other offences, that I wish to keep him a prisoner to-night."</p>
               <p>Without saying another word, he walked across the floor with Marshall, and opened
                  the door of Mary's room. It was just as her own fair hands, obedient only to a
                  refined taste, had arranged it. Ordering in the prisoner before him, he himself
                  followed closely on, bidding the negro to stay in the other apartment.</p>
               <p>In an hour's time, the prisoner had stretched himself out upon the floor of Mary's
                  room, still silent and sullen, to get the night's rest that belonged to him.
                  Captain Howe sat down by him in a chair, and there continued sitting for a long
                  time, until the breathing of the outlaw became deep and heavy. Then he arose
                  softly as-possible, and going into the other room, bade the negro go and lie down
                  beside him. This the black was not backward about doing, anxious as he was to
                  stretch himself out somewhere for the night. The old which had thrown herself down
                  upon her bunk in the corner, and was likewise fast asleep; and the two young
                  lovers sat there through the long hours of midnight, alone, communing with each
                  other as only persons relatively situated know how to do. Even their silence was a
                  source of happiness to them, for it was crowded with an intense sense to each of
                  the other's presence; and that was happiness to either of them.</p>
               <p>Just as soon as the faint, gray streaks of dawn began to shoot up from the eastern
                  horizon, and it was possible for him to do so without stumbling over any objects
                  that might lie in his way, Captain Howe walked cautiously across the floor to the
                  door of his prisoner's apartment, and opened the same. There lay Buff upon the
                  floor, sound asleep, and his gun beside him. He looked still further: the prisoner
                  was gone! He rushed hastily into the room, peered under the bed, hunted closely in
                  every corner, but none but the negro was thereâ€”the bird had flown through the
                  window of his cage, while one of his keepers was sleeping soundly, and the other
                  making love to the fair creature by his side!</p>
               <p>No words are adequate to convey a title of the young man's disappointment and
                  chagrin. He walked cautiously back to his seat and communicated the unwelcome
                  intelligence in a whisper to Mary. She was quite as much surprised as he; but what
                  could she do to help the matter now? What could anybody do to help it?</p>

               <head type="sub">A CHAPTER PURELY OF HISTORY, WHICH ANY ONE MAY SKIP WHO
                  CHOOSES.</head>
               <p>AFTER the battle of White Plains, General Putnam was ordered by General Washington
                  to cross the Hudson, and make all provision in his power to prevent an irruption
                  of the British forces into New Jersey. He was closely followed by the
                  commander-in-chief himself, who, with a part of his army, took post near Fort Lee.
                  After the disastrous fall of that fort, and the subsequent evacuation of Fort
                  Washington, and while the commander-in-chief was slowly retreating with only the
                  sad remnant of an army through the Jerseys, to the banks of the Delaware, Israel
                  Putnam was constantly by his side, encouraging that great man by his hopeful words
                  in the steady resolution and perseverance which at last brought us a nation out of
                  that gulf of despair into which we were then deeply plunged. Putnam was among the
                  very last of the fugitive American army that crossed the Delaware.</p>
               <p>Immediately upon the back of his experience with the retreating army, he was
                  entrusted with the duty of fortifying the city, of Philadelphia, which the
                  Provincial Congress had resolved should be defended to the last extremity. He fell
                  to his new work with the same earnest vigor that had characterized all his
                  previous conduct, remitting no effort that would be in the least likely to forward
                  the grand design with which he was entrusted. The capture of Philadelphia appeared
                  to be the main object and aim of the British authorities; and Putnam was in
                  consequence so much the more determined that it should be effected only with the
                  hardest labor, and after the greatest sacrifices of blood and treasure.</p>
               <p>He accordingly set himself to work to conciliate, both by his authority and
                  example, all contending parties and factions, as well as to excite the individuals
                  inhabitants to put forth uncommon and redoubled efforts in the defence of whatever
                  interested them, or related to their common cause. His individual exertions were
                  unparalleled in the performance of the same duties he prescribed to others; and to
                  such an extent did he carry his zealous efforts, and so harassing were the cares
                  that constantly pressed upon him, that his health began to give way before his
                  exertion. He issued orders<ref rend="super" target="#note_009" xml:id="return_009"

                   in relation to the protection of the buildings against fire, and to the

               <p>The enemy had vainly imagined that to overrun a country, was to conquer it.
                  Already their armies had successively possessed themselves of the cities of
                  Newark, New Brunswick, Princeton, and Trenton, in New Jersey, just as fast as they
                  were abandoned by the retreating Americans. Washington, desirous of undeceiving
                  them in this particular, as well as to engage in some sudden action, whose sure
                  success would re-inspirit his despairing and deserting soldiers, planned the
                  brilliant expedition against Trenton. This place was then occupied chiefly by
                  Hessian troops. Accordingly, at eight o'clock on the morning of the 26th of
                  December, 1776, General Washington took with him twenty four hundred men, and came
                  upon the enemy so unexpectedly as to take one thousand of them prisoners of war,
                  repassing the same day to his own encampment. As soon as his troops had
                  sufficiently recovered themselves from their fatigue, he recrossed the river with
                  his troops the second time to Trenton. On the 2d of January following, Lord
                  Cornwallis advanced upon him with the greater part of the British army, and
                  offered him battle; but as Trenton creek lay between the two armies, and General
                  Washington had it in his power to decline an engagement, he did so for the purpose
                  of completing the masterly plan he then, meditated. Kindling the usual watch-fires
                  about his camp, and stationing faithful men to keep them burning, and advanced
                  sentinels of undoubted fidelity, he silently led off his army after dark by a
                  circuitous route, reaching Princeton by nine o'clock the next morning. Of the
                  British brigade stationed in that town, he killed and captured nearly six hundred;
                  and the noise of his firing was the first intimation Lord Cornwallis had of the
                  march he had stolen upon him during the night. Unwilling with his small numbers to
                  risk an engagement with the entire British army, he filed off to the mountainous
                  grounds in and about Morristown. Meantime, Cornwallis, who arrived with his army
                  at Princeton just as Washington had left it, declined to pursue him, but moved on
                  for Brunswick, where were valuable stores for whose safety he could not now but
                  have fears.</p>
               <p>On the 5th of January, 1777, General Putnam received from General Washington an
                  account of his second successful incursion into the grounds occupied by the enemy,
                  and likewise an order to remove with all his troops, immediately, to Crosswicks,
                  for the purpose of being able to co-operate in the recovery of the Jerseys. He
                  cautioned him against surprises from the enemy, as they would be likely to attempt
                  a severe retaliation for those already practised upon themselves; advised him to
                  represent his forces to be fully twice as large as it was; suggested to him to
                  keep as many spies active as consistent; and to keep a number of horsemen, dressed
                  in rustic style, going constantly forwards and backwards upon the same service;
                  and whenever any new intention or plan of the enemy was unmistakeably discovered
                  to him, to see that immediate intelligence of the same be conveyed, by express, to
                  head-quarters. This peculiar and sleepless service was performed by General<pb
                     n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6939-00000024"/> ral Putnam in a manner highly
                  satisfactory to the commander-in-chief, and nowise inconsistent with the General's
                  well-known character for performing his duty, however arduous. It was not long
                  after this, however, that he was commanded to take post at Princeton, which place
                  he held possession of until spring.</p>
               <p>While in Princeton, he never had under his command at any one time more than a few
                  hundred troops, and yet he was distant only fifteen miles from where the enemy
                  were strongly posted in Brunswick. At one particular time, his numbers became so
                  reduced by the expiration of many of the soldiers' terms of enlistment, and by the
                  slowness with which new 'recruits came to the American standard, that he actually
                  had more miles of frontier to guard, than men with which to guard them! Incredible
                  as this may seem, it is nevertheless strictly true.</p>
               <p>It happened that in Washington's skirmish at Princeton Captain McPherson, a
                  Scotchman, and belonging to the 17th British Regiment, was severely wounded in the
                  lungs, and left behind with the dead. When General Putnam arrived to take
                  possession of the place, he found him in extreme distress, without a nurse or a
                  surgeon, with scarcely a single accommodation, and without a solitary friend to
                  wipe off the death-damps from his brow. He instantly went in person to see him,
                  and ordered for him every comfort and accommodation that was within his reach. But
                  contrary to all expectation, even his own, Captain McPherson recovered after a
                  long while, and expressed to General Putnam the grateful obligations by which he
                  felt bound to him for his generous and disinterested kindness. In the course of
                  conversation, one day, with the General, the invalid asked his friendâ€”"Pray,
                  General Putnam, what countryman are you?" "An American," answered the latter.
                  "What not a Yankee?" inquired McPherson. "Yes, a full-blooded one!" responded the
                  General, "By G-d!" exclaimed the sick man, "I am sorry for thatâ€”I did not think
                  there could be so much goodness and generosity in an American, or, indeed, in
                  anybody but a Scotchman!"</p>
               <p>While yet the recovery of Captain McPherson was a matter of doubt, he earnestly
                  desired General Putnam to send for a friend in the British army, to come and
                  assist him in making his will. At that particular time. General Putnam had but
                  fifty men in his command. The proposition was one to which he was exceedingly
                  reluctant to express his dissent, and yet it was attended with serious
                  embarrassment to him. His heart was divided with two conflicting emotionsâ€”humanity
                  and fear. On the one had, he was extremely unwilling to refuse this last favor to
                  a seemingly dying man; while, on the other, he was dissatisfied that an exposure
                  to the British should thus unnecessarily be made of the weakness of his force. He
                  was plainly in a dilemma.</p>
               <p>But the good genius of Israel Putnam did not desert him here. It had befriended
                  and guided him in far greater straits than this, and he trusted confidently to it
                  now. He bethought himself of a fortunate expedient, just in time to save himself
                  from farther trouble. A flag of truce was instantly dispatched to the British
                  lines with Captain McPherson's request, with the strict and positive order not to
                  return with his friend until after dark. In the evening, lights were accordingly
                  placed in every room of the College buildings, and in every apartment of the
                  vacant houses all through the town. While the Englishman was with his friend,
                  Putnam kept the fifty menâ€”his entire forceâ€”marching, sometimes all in one company,
                  and sometimes in detachments, now from this quarter, and now from that, past the
                  house where the sick man lay. On the return of the Englishman to his camp, it is
                  well known that he reported to his commander that General Putnam had under him at
                  Princeton a force of at least four or five thousand men! Such a device on the part
                  of General Putnam served well to impress the enemy with a large idea of our
                  numbers, and to deter them effectually from attempting any surprises and
                  incursions they else might have been emboldened to make.</p>
               <p>When at length the spring had so far advanced that it was certain the enemy must
                  soon take the field, the commander-in-chief, after requesting General Putnam to
                  give the officer who was to relieve him at Princeton all the information necessary
                  for the safe keeping of that post, appointed the latter to the command of a
                  separate army in the Highlands on the Hudson. In obedience to this order, General
                  Putnam at once took post at Peekskill; at which post we leave him, the British
                  still in possession of the city of New York, and the tories, skinners, refugees,
                  and cow-boys ravaging, destroying and pillaging all through the interjacent county
                  of Westchesterâ€”while, with the permission of the reader who has kindly consented
                  to wade through this chapter with us, we will resume the thread of our story.</p>

               <p>LOW down in the county of Westchester, and properly within the British lines,
                  there lived a family at the time when the enemy held the city of New York, named
                  Wilson. It consisted of Mr. Wilson, his sisterâ€”a maiden ladyâ€”and his daughters
                  Alice and Ellen. Their dwelling was one of the few in that region that seemed to
                  have been built exclusively for comfort, it being planned upon a somewhat liberal
                  scale, and finished for the promotion of family enjoyment more than aught else.
                  The building was wholly of wood; a square building, with a wing at either
                  extremity, and a verandah, supported with plain and chaste corinthian pillars,
                  running across its entire front. The house stood upon a slight elevation, and just
                  at the edge of a shading grove. Perhaps the road passed it at the distance of
                  twenty-five of thirty roads. From this piazza, on some of the clear days in
                  summer, were to be seen sights, and drank in sounds, such as rejuvenate the soul,
                  and fill it up with a thousand inspiriting thoughts and fresh emotions. The road
                  ran at the right of the house, through the natural course of a ravine somewhat
                  thickly overshadowed by brush and trees. On the left, rose from the edge of a
                  small plain or meadow, successive ridges and knolls, each crowned with a thick
                  growth of healthy wood. In the rear ran, far back as the eye could stretch, a
                  grove and it at length was bounded by the curvature of the road. In front, there
                  was an almost uninterrupted view of the country for a great distance. Clump of
                  woods, freshly opening glades, and wavy, undulating fields, with only here and
                  there a few scattered trees to relieve their otherwise monotonous character,
                  filled up the charming vista. It was an absolute luxury to sit upon this verandah
                  of Mr. Wilson's mansion, of a pleasant day, and give one's self up to the
                  contemplation of the scene.</p>
               <p>The well-understood wealth of Mr. Wilson was fully sufficient to make all that
                  appertained to his house a perfect paradise, in and of itself. The furniture was
                  costlyâ€”for those times, luxurious. His tables were not unsupplied with service of
                  the most massive silver ware, and his cellar never lacked for the choicest and
                  most costly wines. Never suffered he his larders to become impoverished, while
                  there was anything to be had from his own estate, or as long as the market in New
                  York could furnish him with the abundance he craved.</p>
               <p>In politics, Mr. Wilson was one of those who in those days termed themselves
                  loyalists; that is, he hated to give up the idea of allegiance to his sovereign,
                  while that sovereign was the rightful (because powerful) one in the land.
                  Accordingly, he made it a point to court all possible favor with the officers of
                  the enemy, aware that their authority, in times of need and danger, would be the
                  surest safeguard for his estates, real and personal.</p>
               <p>His family, all females, lent their thoughts but little to the intricacies and
                  perplexities of political subjects, much as they entered into the life and duty of
                  the people of that time; leaving such subjects wholly to the superior wisdom and
                  sagacity of him they thought every way competent to dispose of them. Their
                  ambition all centered upon the internal arrangements of their mansion, in the
                  thought of making as much happiness for themselves as possible, and the desire to
                  fulfil to the utmost the duties that were properly theirs.</p>
               <p>Alice was the elder of the daughters; a beautiful blonde, with large, dark, and
                  speaking eyes; dark wavy hair; an intellectual forehead, and a mouth where smiles
                  seemed always struggling for a positive existence. When she laughed, the echoes
                  were as soft and clear as the dripping of crystal water; and she disclosed a
                  double row of the smallest, pearly white teeth imaginable. Her figure was well
                  formed, giving her an air of dignified grace and decided beauty. Her dress, too,
                  was always in perfect taste and keeping with her complexion and figure,
                  heightening them to the greatest advantage.</p>
               <p>The younger sisterâ€”Ellenâ€”though not gifted with any features that might be called
                  beautiful, still had a face that bore the unmistakeable stamp of spirituality. Her
                  complexion was nearly all the time destitute of the least color; her forehead was
                  intellectually high and uncommonly pale; her eyes were a dark blue, that seemed,
                  as they bent upon you, to be but the truest reflex of her soul and all its
                  palpitating feelings; her mouth was formed finely, but firmly: and upon all her
                  features, breathed and expression, or an air, of the sweetest sadness, such as
                  marked her as a being of no common mould. There was a reason, too, for all this
                  additional beauty and expressiveness in her countenance, for nature never, or
                  rarely, stints in one particular, except she takes great care to be exceeding
                  lavish in another. So with Ellen; she was a confirmed <emph>hunchback!</emph> Not
                  unaware herself of the extent of such a misfortune, when considered from many
                  merely <emph>worldly</emph> points of view, she nevertheless considered it in its
                  truest sense no misfortune, but rather an additional incentive to real,
                  heart-strong, kindly exertion. And as her body grew less graceful and more weak
                  under these exertions of hers, her soul grew more strong, more perfectly
                  developed, and more attractively beautiful for its qualities.</p>
               <p>There was a small social gathering of British officers, accompanied by several
                  ladies, at the mansion of Mr. Wilson, one day in the month of June, 1777, and the
                  house was alive with mirth and rejoicing. The journey from New York had been a
                  fatiguing one, and it was determined, after some urging on the part of Mr. Wilson
                  and his maiden sister, to remain in their present comfortable quarters till at
                  least the next day.</p>
               <p>Evening came on. The sky was clearer than glass and myriad stars peeped through
                  the ocean of blue in whose far away depths they were hidden. The full moon had
                  risen but a little way above the eastern horizon, begirting leaf, and shrub, and
                  flower and grass blade with a sheen of matchless beauty. The slight dews that had
                  already fallen, still lay on the grass like endless beds of diamonds, untarnished
                  and untouched. The few shadows thrown across the yard and upon the piazza from the
                  near tree tops, only served to heighten the charm with which the clear moonlight
                  invested everything else. Dark and mysterious shadows, continuous and unbroken,
                  hung over the entire length of the road, as it would round in the distance above
                  them. There was a hush in the air that seemed holiness itself; inspiring the
                  purest thoughts; awakening the most loving desires; charming and enveloping every
                  sense, until it yielded itself unreservedly to the secret influences that were
                  setting in on every hand.</p>
               <p>The parlor of the mansion of Mr. Wilson was lighted brilliantly. The windows were
                  still flung widely open, and but partially screened by closed blinds. On the long
                  seats that were ranged along the piazza, sat the greater portion of the family
                  with their visiters. They were engaged in agreeable converse upon the scene
                  immediately about and before them, and it was no difficult matter to determine
                  that the tone of their<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6939-00000025"/> conversation, if
                  not of their thoughts, was materially subdued and softened by the influences that
                  stole over them from without. The woodbine and honeysuckle, clambering in rivalry
                  up the pure white pilasters, and then running wildly over the eaves and up the
                  roof, shed sweetest fragrance for every nostril; and it is nothing preposterous or
                  ridiculous to say, that the same fragrance seemed to be crushed out of their very
                  words, at the moment they uttered them.</p>
               <p>Alice was sitting in the parlor upon the sofa in company with one of her father's
                  guest, a rather young-looking officer in the British armyâ€”Major Templeton. He was
                  sitting quite near her, and the conversation in which they indulged was in so low
                  a tone as to be almost inaudible. Ever and anon, he bent his head over closely to
                  hers, when he whispered to her some endearing expression, and the crimson flushed
                  in her cheeks. Then she looked steadily up into his eyes again, as if she would
                  satisfy herself that what he said was all true as the heart that would fain
                  receive it.</p>
               <p>Presently, the unusual quiet of the scene was interrupted in a measure by the
                  appearance of a young man on the outside, in front of the piazza. He had come no
                  one could tell whither, as a shadow, or as a fresh ray of moonlight would suddenly
                  come, and lay across their path. He was a young man, wearing no hat or cap upon
                  upon his head, but carrying it in his hand, and his profuse hair dishevelled
                  greatly. He at once began gesticulating in a most furious manner, and the words he
                  wanted were nothing loth to find their way to his lips:</p>
               <p>"It's the full o' the moon to night!" exclaimed he, wildly, yet his tone was
                  almost silvery sweet and musical; "it's the full o' the moon to night! Look
                  there!â€”look there!" and he pointed upwards to the moon. "There's riot out
                  to-night! There's blood, red blood, to be shed to-night! I see it on the moon's
                  disc now! I see it on the ground, where the moon-beams lay! I see it in the air!
                  Look! Look! Do you not all see it? It were better for you that you did! What!â€”not
                  see the blood? It's all about you now! It's on the leavesâ€”on the tree-boughsâ€”on
                  the grassâ€”on the ground! Not see the blood? Not see the blood? Look up there! Read
                  it in the face of that round, full moon!"</p>
               <p>"Poor creature!" softly exclaimed young Ellen Wilson, to a lady who sat next
                  her.</p>
               <p>"Who is he?" inquired her companion.</p>
               <p>"His name is Tim Flood," answered she; "he came no one knows whence to this place,
                  and father has allowed him and his motherâ€”a sweet and heavenly womanâ€”the use of an
                  old house on the estate. It isn't far from here, and in the morning we will all
                  walk over to it. I have exerted myself to make the poor woman comfortable, but do
                  not know how well I have succeeded. She appears to have a large amount of true
                  poetry in her nature, and is far too refined for the circumstances that surround
                  her. She must certainly once have been a lady <emph>somewhere;</emph> but her
                  position is wonderfully changed now. We supply her with the necessaries of
                  existence for herself and this son you see, and she employs herself at any and all
                  kinds of work in our family in return. I should not be surprised if she were in
                  the house even now."</p>
               <p>"Shouldn't you? I have taken a sudden interest in her," returned her companion. "I
                  shall ask of you the privilege of going in and conversing with her soon. But let
                  us listen to this poor young man a little longer, first."</p>
               <p>"He is a lunatic, I think," said Ellen. "And yet he does not rave as all lunatics
                  do. He does no mischief, or violence, either. On the contrary, his heart is as
                  mild as your own at this very moment. I love to sit and listen to his babble
                  sometimes, even though the sight of a shattered intellect is suggestive of so much
                  misery; he is so full of poetic sentiments and fanciesâ€”broken and fragmentary, to
                  be sure, but none the less beautiful, because in pieces. Hear him now, poor
                  creature!"</p>
               <p>"Does the moon rave? Does the moon ever go mad?" asked the unfortunate young man,
                  pointing hither and you in a series of the most extravagant gestures. "Does the
                  pale, pale moon ever smile, fair ladies, as you smile now? Does it smile? Yes,
                  yes, yes! I look in her face and I see a smile there now! It is a broad smile,
                  that covers her whole face! But it is a ghastly smile, too; reddened with the glow
                  of flowing blood! See <emph>you</emph> that smile? How awful it is! How it
                  discolors the whole face of the moon? How it shoots out beyond the disc those
                  broad streaks of red lightâ€”all bloodâ€”all red blood! See you <emph>them?</emph> See
                  you <emph>them?</emph>"</p>
               <p>Then he instantly turned his back upon the company gathered upon the piazza, and
                  stood for a long time gazing steadily into the moon's face. He spake no syllable,
                  but kept his arms still swinging uncontrollably to and fro, and his fingers
                  constantly and vainly clutching, as if to grasp some substance he imagined to be
                  in the thin air around him. Then he slowly and deliberately combed his long and
                  flowing locks with his fingers, and brushed them back from off his forehead, as if
                  he would thus readily brush away every obstacle that intervened between his own
                  soul and the fantastic visions he saw in the face of the silver moon.</p>
               <p>"The great moon is a glorious sight!" resumed he, suddenly turning partially round
                  to the company. "It is the fairest object that we who dwell on earth may look at!
                  But we do not all see it alike. Some only see a man's face in it; and some think
                  they see mountains; and some, large lakes and rivers: but none of them see what I
                  see! No one <emph>can</emph> see as much as I do! I know all the people that live
                  there! I can call them all by nameâ€”I know the rank of each and every oneâ€”they are
                  my friendsâ€”they love me, and I love them! I send them back my thoughts on the
                  backs of the yellow moonbeams; and when they get there, they are as clear as the
                  crystal that their lakes and rivers are made of! They look at me, too, out of
                  their eyes; they smile at me, when I smile; and they weep when I' weep. Now they
                  all smile at me; but their smiles are ghastly smiles! They are forbidding and
                  fearful! They make my blood curdle in my vlens! They bid me tell youâ€”beware!
                  There's blood about! It's every where about us! It's in the air; on the leaves; on
                  the grass; on the water; on the door post; on the sill; on the fence; in the fair,
                  pure flower cups; it's <emph>every where!</emph> I see itâ€”I smell it now! My hands
                  are red with it! Oh, what an ocean of blood! No water will wash it outâ€”its stains
                  are deep, and they will not come out!"</p>
               <p>"Why does he talk so much of blood?" asked one of the gentlemen of Mr. Wilson.
                  "One would think that that was a cause of his madness. Can it be that he went mad
                  in consequence of some sudden disaster, like murder, to his family? Has he a
                  mother?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, sir," answered Mr. Wilson.</p>
               <p>"And father?"</p>
               <p>"None that I can hear of," replied Mr. Wilson. "His mother and he dropped down
                  here from somewhere, one night last autumn, and here they have stayed since. I
                  have given them a little roof that stands on my estate, for their unmolested use,
                  and they manage to do work enough for my family to pay us for the necessaries I
                  allow them. The mother is really an object of the deepest interest to me, although
                  I assure you that but for the superior sagacity and appreciative powers of my
                  daughter Ellen, I might never have made the melancholy discovery to this day."</p>
               <p>"Is the woman beautiful?" pursued his interrogator.</p>
               <p>"Not that, exactly, now; but she certainly must have been once. Her features were
                  evidently cast in the finest mould, and the expression upon them now, though full
                  of sadness and thoughtfulness, is none the less sweet and winning."</p>
               <p>"Can the moon keep her secrets?" again broke forth the young man. "Can her large
                  heart deceive those who read it, as I read it to-night? No, no, no! There is no
                  deceit!â€”no concealment! All is as plain as a printed page! Its letters are all
                  red, too! They speak of what is to come! I can read them! I know their meaning!
                  They tell me what's comingâ€”and it's bloodshed! It's war! It's war between father
                  and sonâ€”between mother and daughterâ€”between brother and sisterâ€”between husband and
                  wife! It's civil warâ€”worse than all wars the blood-soaked earth ever knew! It's
                  death to everything like love, and affection, and faith in families, and peaceful
                  labor! Hear that? See that? If you don't, then you will! You <emph>must</emph> see
                  it! The moon can't keep secrets! The moon is a great tell-tale! She lets people
                  read her heartâ€”she lets human eyes wander all over her face! But they can't all
                  see with the eyes that <emph>I</emph> do! They can't read her secrets as
                     <emph>I</emph> canâ€”they can't dive down into the depths of her heart as
                     <emph>I</emph> dive down, and bring up such treasures, too! No, no, no! The
                  moon is cold, and distant, and repulsive to some! It is to youâ€”all of you; but it
                  is not to <emph>me!</emph> It shines for me to-night as warm as the sun at
                  mid-dayâ€”it glows on my my back, and makes me feel its genial warmthâ€”it bathes my
                  temples and my bared forehead in its silvery sheen, and I feel filled with
                  glorious thoughts, such as I never had before, and such as I cannot utter! It
                  warms up my heart, and my blood begins to flow fast again in my veins! I love the
                  full, round moonâ€”it is the great shield of Godâ€”it covers His great designs, and
                  one who can read the moon can read them! Oh, how I wish I could fly to thee, oh,
                  beautiful moon! and bathe myself in the sea of liquid silver that fans thy great,
                  broad bosom! See you the moon?â€”that moon? Read it thenâ€”read it slowly and well!
                  See what characters are writ on it, and take timely warning! See what your doom
                  must be, all of you! See how the great God is going to dispose of coming events.
                  But, do not forget for a mo-moment the blood! No, no, noâ€”forget not that! It is
                  all about you now! I see itâ€”I smell it! It is more than that water can wash it
                  out!"</p>
               <p>"How he rages!" exclaimed the lady, sitting by the side of Ellen. "Let us leave
                  him and go inâ€”I am interested in his mother, from what you have already told me of
                  her, and shall be obliged to you if you will see if she is any where in the
                  house."</p>
               <p>"Certainly; follow me in," replied Ellen, rising from her seat on the piazza
                  bench, and moving to the door of the hall.</p>
               <p>They entered, and found none but Major Temple ton and Alice there together. They
                  still sat upon the sofa, and the blushes, deeper than ever, that suffused the fair
                  cheeks of Alice as her sister and her companion entered the parlor, betrayed the
                  feeling that stole over her full as rapidly. The companion of Ellen seated herself
                  at a little distance from the Major and Alice, while Ellen went into another
                  apartment to see whether Mrs. Floodâ€”the young man's motherâ€”was in the house. In a
                  few minutes she returned with her, and they all three sat down for a genial
                  conversation. The lady had become so much more deeply interested in the poor woman
                  immediately upon seeing her, that she confessed to herself that she had the
                  sweetest countenance and the most engaging manners she had ever met with in all
                  her life.</p>
               <p>The mother had not sat there long, however, before her face and features began to
                  give evidence of the strangest internal commotion. Ellen asked her in a gentle
                  voice if she were unwell, and if she might run and bring her a glass of water, or
                  even of wine; but Mrs. Flood appeared to take no notice of what she said, and her
                  symptoms continued to grow more alarming.</p>
               <p>At length she rose slowly from her chair, her eyes fixed upon the figure of Major
                  Templeton, who still continued talking with Alice. Her vision seemed closed to
                  every other object but him. She had suddenly lost the feminine delicacy of her
                  appearance, and her muscles appeared on the instant to knit together in a strength
                  she never knew before. She strode with an air of pride up before the officer,
                     and<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6939-00000026"/> accosted him, her feeble voice
                  much raised from its usual tone:</p>
               <p>"Am I mistaken?. Is it not he?"</p>
               <p>"What do you mean, woman?" inquired the Major, turning half round upon her, and
                  affecting not to un stand what she meant by her strange words and manmer.</p>
               <p>"Yes," continued Mrs. Flood, not heeding him; "yes! 'tis his voice! I knew him
                  from that! Mr. Templeton!"</p>
               <p>"That is my name," replied he, as calmly as he could, yet turning deathly
                  pale.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Is</emph> it you, then? Yes, but it is you! You <emph>forget</emph>
                  me!"</p>
               <p>"Indeed, madam, I do not know you," said he.</p>
               <p>Then you have forgotten poor Margaret May? You have forgotten her so soon? But why
                  should you <emph>not</emph> have done so? What were your words but smooth-sounding
                  deceits? What your promises but downright lies? Yes, yes; you <emph>have</emph>
                  forgotten me, I see! I see that you do not <emph>wish</emph> to remember such an
                  one as me any longer!"</p>
               <p>Alice, meanwhile, sat anxiously gazing into the face of the intruder, unable to
                  say a word, and most of all wishing that she should make an explanation of her
                  language. It sounded strangely wild to her ears, and she more than half began to
                  fear that the mother, too, might, in some mysterious manner, have imbibed the
                  lunacy of her son.</p>
               <p>"You ask for the explanation of all this, sweet mistress," continued Mrs. Flood,
                  looking at the anxious countenance of Alice as she spoke. "You shall have it! It
                  shall all be made as plain as noonday!"</p>
               <p>Major Templeton's face assumed every conceivable expression, except that of
                  satisfaction, while the pallor that suddenly overspread his countenance, betrayed
                  the fear that already lurked in his heart. If he was a brave man in battle trials,
                  at least he was a white-lipped coward now!</p>
               <p>"This man once promised me his heartâ€”his love, Miss Alice! In my own happy home,
                  in England, years ago he sought me out, professing to be enraptured with my
                  beauty, but more in love with my characterâ€”and won my heart. I gave it to him
                  freelyâ€”freely did I give it all to him! I was young and thoughtless. I thought the
                  whole world were just as pure at their intentions, and just as honest as I was
                  myself. I had no fear from any one, especially from him who had sworn himself my
                  lover. He led me on, by promises, and by frequent expressions of his affection. He
                     <emph>ruined me!</emph> Yes, behold this wreckâ€”and he, the cause of it all!
                  Still he protested, to all I said to him, that he still loved me! Still he kept
                  alive his promises! That child was the evidence of my shameâ€”my eternal infamy in
                  the sight of my parents! He is at this hour a babbling lunatic! This man is his
                  father!â€”"</p>
               <p>"Away with you! You are a lying creatureâ€”you are crazy!" shouted Major Templeton,
                  pushing her away with his hand, while he rose from his seat as if to go and leave
                  her.</p>
               <p>"I will <emph>not</emph> away!" cried she, in a voice that startled those seated
                  on the piazza, and instantly collected them about the door of the parlor. "I am
                     <emph>not</emph> the lying creature you would make me! And now that Providence
                  has allowed me to set the monster out in his true light to you, sweet Miss Alice,
                  I shall be more content! I have stripped off the mask he has worn about him too
                  long already. He would come and marry another fair lady on these shores, and he
                  has one alreadyâ€”a <emph>wife</emph> alreadyâ€”at his own house at home! And so he
                  thinks to deceive every one! He thinks there is no track which he himself makes,
                  by which retribution can ever overtake him! But he mistakes! He is overtaken
                  already! Oh! that he could but restore to the poor heart that is in this bosom,
                  the peace that once belonged to it! But he cannotâ€”no, no, he cannot! It is all too
                  late now! This poor heart is too desolate now!"</p>
               <p>"What, mother," exclaimed Tim Flood, who had followed the rest, unbeknown to them,
                  across the piazza and quite to the door of the parlor, "what! have not you seen
                  the moon to-night? It's all blood! Comeâ€”come and see!"</p>
               <p>"That is his child!" said the pale mother, not heeding what her son said but
                  remembering that it was his voice she heard.</p>
               <p>"Is this his son, mother?" asked the lunatic. "<emph>This</emph> his son? And
                  where's the father, then? Where's the father?"</p>
               <p>"There! There!" replied the mother, pointing to Major Templeton in a frenzy of
                  feeling which she could in no wise control.</p>
               <p>"It's false! The woman is crazy!" replied Major Templeton, his feelings wrought to
                  their highest pitch of excitement.</p>
               <p>"Before the great God, at whose bar we shall all appear!" said Mrs. Flood,
                  elevating her hands and glancing upwards, "what I have just spoken, is as true as
                  the Sacred Word itself! I am not crazy. I am in the possession of my reason! I am
                  only excitedâ€”excited to come so suddenly upon one whom I had thought never again
                  in <emph>this</emph> world, at least, to see! What I have told in the presence of
                  this company, Mr. Templetonâ€”<emph>William</emph> Templetonâ€”is true!. You are the
                  father of this child of mine! And if you seek to ensnare others as fair and as
                  virtuous as I was once myself, I am by your side to betray to them your true
                  character! Remember! Were you the real man the world wrongly gives you the credit
                  of being, you would this day be protecting <emph>me</emph>â€”the lone soul to whom
                  you so many times pledged all your affectionâ€”all your loveâ€”all your valueless
                  life!"</p>
               <p>While she was speaking, Tim Flood advanced at a stealthy pace across the carpeted
                  floor, and, bending low so as to obtain a fair view of his reputed father's
                  countenance, stared wildly for a few moments into his face.</p>
               <p>"My father, mother!" exclaimed he, at length. 'No, no, no! No father this of
                     <emph>mine!</emph> The moon tells me another story than this! My father doesn't
                  dress like this, mother! He's more of a gentleman, too, than this man! My father!
                  ha, ha, ha! He's <emph>nobody's</emph> fatherâ€”he's nobody's <emph>son</emph>â€”he's
                  nobody at all himself! What a man! What a slim shadow! How pale his face is! How
                  white-lipped he is, too! <emph>He</emph> any one's father! That's a good jokeâ€”a
                  good joke! But, see, see, she wants help! She's grown weak! Why do you not take
                  her in your arms?"</p>
               <p>He pointed to the figure of Alice, as he spoke, that now lay stretched out upon
                  the sofa in a state of perfect insensibility. So excited had they all become with
                  the scene they had so unexpectedly been called to witness, that the condition of
                  Alice had been suffered to pass thus long unobserved.</p>
               <p>The mistress of the mansion suddenly sprang forward to catch her up in her arms,
                  and Ellen and the other ladies volunteered to perform the same service, when a
                  loud and terrific yell was heard without the house, seeming to enter at each door
                  and opened windowâ€”so frightful and so inhuman, as to freeze the blood as it ran
                  through their veins.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">THREE SURPRISES, AND THREE TIMES AS MANY PRISONERS.</head>
               <p>THE gentlemen had thought of everything but a surprise at a point so far below the
                  American lines, and were not, accordingly, at the moment accoutred as they might
                  have been in a more perilous situation. They rushed to the door, however, unarmed
                  as they were, and were accosted by a band of men whose leader rode on
                  horseback.</p>
               <p>"Do you surrender without words, or shall we have a fight?" demanded the leader,
                  in an imperative tone that thrilled those who heard it.</p>
               <p>No answer was made to his question.</p>
               <p>"Go in, my boys!" ordered he; "take every man" in the house a prisoner! Give them
                  quarterâ€”give them quarter; but don't spare those who would take a life when you
                  don't threaten them!"</p>
               <p>Obedient to the commands of their leader, the men at once rushed pell-mell in at
                  the doors and windows, and succeeded without difficulty in arresting every man
                  there was in the house. The ladies they of course left untouched. Bringing their
                  prisoners before their commander, who still sat on his horse, a vigilant
                  supervisor of the work that was done, he asked each one of them his name and rank.
                  To his questions, always put with respectfulness, some answered cheerfully and
                  correctly; while others refused to make any reply whatever.</p>
               <p>"Very well, then," said the leader, "we must carry you all along with us. Men,
                  form about the prisonersâ€”march!"</p>
               <p>"Stay but one moment!" cried out a voice from the crowd. "Stay but one moment
                  more!"</p>
               <p>The leader turned himself quite round on his horse, and seeing that the voice
                  proceeded from the place where were gathered the prisoners, rode quickly up to
                  them. The voice was that of Mr. Wilson himself, the father of Alice and Ellen.</p>
               <p>"What will you, sir?" asked the commander of the force, speaking quickly and
                  somewhat sternly. "Be in a hurry, for we cannot halt long here!"</p>
               <p>"As you love you own children, sir," said Mr. Wilsonâ€”"if you are blessed with
                  theâ€”â€”'</p>
               <p>"Oh, well; I amâ€”I am!" quickly interrupted the officer, jocularly. "At any rate,
                     <emph>suppose</emph> me to be!"</p>
               <p>"Then suffer me to return to my house again. I know not but my child is at this
                  moment dyingâ€”my own daughter! Speak to me, sir, and let me return. She was
                  desperately ill when you came upon us, and may need nothing so much as a father's
                  care in her last moments."</p>
               <p>Without stopping to consider the improbability of his story on its very faceâ€”for
                  it truly might have seemed strange to any one that a death should be on the point
                  of taking place in the midst of such festivitiesâ€”the officer replied to him:</p>
               <p>"Yes, go; and keep yourself clear hereafter from all such connexions as these
                  British! God make you a patriot, and save your daughter!"</p>
               <p>The gentleman did not stop to thank his captor for so generous a favor as his
                  liberty certainly was, under all the circumstances, but hurried directly back into
                  the house. The company then started forward at a double quick pace, following the
                  road that wound away to the northward in plain view of the mansion of Mr. Wilson.
                  In an incredibly short space of time, after the kicking up of such a hubbub, the
                  place was as quiet as if nothing had been there to disturb the repose that now
                  hung all around it.</p>
               <p>We must now leave the companyâ€”which was an advanced company of Americans, sent out
                  from head-quarters at Peek skill to break up the lawless bands of renegades that
                  ravaged all the country around, leaving not even peaceable and inoffensive
                  citizens unharmed in the enjoyment of what was by honest labor theirsâ€”we must, we
                  say, leave this company to march on with their prisoners, and take the reader to
                  the contemplation of another scene, which was almost at the same moment
                  enacting,</p>
               <p>Two men were journeying along in the moonlight of that evening, at some distance
                  from the road; the one a tallish lank, and wiry-looking man, somewhere, to
                  appearances, in the vicinity of forty years of age; the other, much younger in his
                  look, yet bearing about him no mark of peculiarity, either one way or the other.
                  They were some five miles, or a trifle less, north of the place where the scene we
                  have already described was enacting, picking their way with great caution over the
                  ledges and untravelled by paths in the edges of the woods; now winding around the
                  base of a ledgy knoll, or ridge, and now plunging still farther into the woods for
                  greater security against discovery. Their course was southward, and it was evident
                  that they intended to strike into the road below as soon as it should be safe
                  enough for them so to do.</p>
               <p>The elder of the two appeared to be the guide of the other, as he was constantly
                  breaking out in some expression of caution, and uttering some principle or rule by
                  which safe travelling through disputed lands might pretty generally be secured. He
                  likewise kept<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6939-00000027"/> taking hold of the arm of
                  his more youthful and impetuous comrade, and checking him in a haste that might
                  very unexpectedly be the instrument of his ruin.</p>
               <p>They had finally arrived at a place in the road, where was situated a rocky and
                  exceedingly precipitous hill on either side of it. To climb the hills, or to think
                  of going round them through all the rubbish and roughness there was about them,
                  was a hard thing for two such really tired travellers to contemplate; so they at
                  once concluded to take the road for a short distance, and the consequences along
                  with it.</p>
               <p>It was too late for them to think of retreating, when they found that they had
                  unexpectedly come upon a party of Skinners, lying in ambush at the sudden angle of
                  the road. They were too clearly in their hands to think of an experiment so
                  hazardous. So they exchanged whispers with each otherâ€”whispers purely of
                  counselâ€”and journeyed on as boldly as if no one beleaguered their path.</p>
               <p>"Hold there!" cried out one of the gang, springing forward from the side of the
                  road, and advancing to the front of the travellers. They accordingly halted, as
                  all honest travellers would do when not in an imminent hurry, and closely
                  questioned.</p>
               <p>"Tell us where ye come fromâ€”and where you're goin'?" demanded the intruder, about
                  whom had now gathered pretty much every man of the outlaw gang.</p>
               <p>"That is a question, or rather those are questions, my friend, very easy of
                  answerin'," coolly and calmly replied the elder of the two travellers.</p>
               <p>"By my soul! I believe we've got old Piety himself here, after all. But tell who
                  ye are?" said the Skinner who had first stopped them.</p>
               <p>"We are honest men, then, in pursuit of honest business. Does <emph>that</emph>
                  satisfy you any better?"</p>
               <p>"Not so easy duped as all that comes to, either. Do you really <emph>preach</emph>
                  for your livin'? Or do you live a free sort o' like the gentlemen you see about
                  ye?"</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, I should verily think!" exclaimed the elder traveller, feigning great
                  deliberation and composure. "Gentlemen, indeed!"</p>
               <p>"Come, come, old long legs! None of your preachin' now, or you may have to pick
                  out a text for your own funeral sermon. Who are ye?â€”where are ye goin'? Tell us
                  that."</p>
               <p>"Wal, as for that," slowly rejoined the traveller, who still continued to do the
                  talking, "as for that, we are goin' down to the lower part of the country, with
                  your most gracious permission! Anything more! Ask all the questions you wish,
                  gentlemen; only do not, I beg you, disgrace yourselves by abusing the ministers of
                  God, whenever they happen to come in your way."</p>
               <p>"Wal, old piety, who's this with ye? You're a strange lookin' couple, by the holy
                  Moses!"</p>
               <p>"This gentleman, is my son. I am desirous of procuring him a situation in the city
                  below, and have thought proper to accompany him on his first visit to the city
                  myself. It is a duty I think I owe to myself, as well as to him. Anything more,
                  gentlemen?"</p>
               <p>"Give us a handful of change, then, by way o' toll, and get along with ye where ye
                  will!"</p>
               <p>"It's hard, gentlemen, to part with all the change one has; particularly when
                  one's on a long and expensive journey. But I never refuse the calls of charity,
                  whenever I hear them made as now, and here is all the money I have about me. Take
                  it, and God make it pleasant spendin' of it to ye!"</p>
               <p>The leader held out his hand to receive the proffered tollâ€”for such he considered
                  it legitimately to beâ€”and then with a horrid oath ordered both the men begone, for
                  that no good could come to anybody travelling so late in the day as that.</p>
               <p>"We have deceived them," said the elder traveller to his companion; "I hardly
                  thought we should do it so easily."</p>
               <p>"Let us hurry on then!" responded the younger.</p>
               <p>"No! For heaven's sake, no! Not until we are completely out of their sight. Every
                  moment now is precious to us, and counts fully a year in our lives. If they search
                  us, we are lost; for they will certainly find out who we are. So be cautiousâ€”be
                  cautious. I'ts bright moonlight, remember, and they can see our every motion as
                  plainly as at noonday."</p>
               <p>"Now! Let us start and run <emph>now!</emph>" urged the young man, before they
                  could have advanced a dozen paces farther.</p>
               <p>"No, no!" screamed out the other, in a whisper. "Your life! Think of your life!"
                  and he looked fearfully over his shoulder. "They know me, I verily believe! They
                  stand in the road, looking at me now!"</p>
               <p>"How should they know you, pray?"</p>
               <p>"I have met with the leader of that infamous gang before. I know him well, and he
                  has reason, too, to be familiar with some of the traits of <emph>my</emph>
                  character! I verily think he has repented him of his resolution to let me slip by
                  so easily, now!"</p>
               <p>"Why? what does he do?"</p>
               <p>"Nothingâ€”nothing! Look not back, for your life! Let <emph>my</emph> eyes answer!
                  They see allâ€”they will give you all necessary warning!"</p>
               <p>"What are they doing <emph>now?"</emph> asked the younger, anxious to learn the
                  exact state of the case, as well as to settle as soon as he could the fears that
                  rose within him.</p>
               <p>"They are talking closely togetherâ€”"</p>
               <p>"Who? the leader and the rest?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. Now they are looking this wayâ€”looking steadily at us. Now they are pointing
                  towards us! The leader shakes his head, and still looks towards us!"</p>
               <p>"What are they doing <emph>now?</emph>" asked the other, after the interval of
                  half a minute, which to him must have been the space of half an hour.</p>
               <p>"One of themâ€”two of themâ€”threeâ€”fourâ€”<emph>five</emph> of them have started this
                  way! They are walking rapidly!"</p>
               <p>"Let us run, then! Let us plunge into the woods at once and be out of their
                  sight!"</p>
               <p>"No, no, no! Keep your pace yet! We must reach that huge rock yonder first; keep
                  your pace. The leader calls them back!"</p>
               <p>"Then there's hope for us?"</p>
               <p>"Be not too sure. They know I've got my eyes on 'em, and it's only a ruse for
                     <emph>us;</emph> they think we shall take advantage of our fright, and run. But
                  do not run yet!"</p>
               <p>They kept on at the same steady walk for another minute. So excited had the
                  younger one become that the perspiration stood in huge beaded drops upon his
                  temples, and his eyes glared with an unnatural fire.</p>
               <p>"What are they doing now?" again asked he, unable to keep his anxiety pent up
                  within his breast any longer.</p>
               <p>"Now he gives orders to them to pursue! he leads them on himself! They're coming
                  on us! They'll be here soon!"</p>
               <p>"Run! Run, then, for our lives!"</p>
               <p>"No, no! not yet! not yet!"</p>
               <p>"Why not? Let us gain time!"</p>
               <p>"I know them better than you! I've seen those rascals, the most of 'em, before.
                  Now they come! We are near enough to the rock! Come on, thenâ€”run with all your
                  legs! Run as if you were made for nothing elseâ€”run, run!"</p>
               <p>Both men instantly set off in as vigorous and rapid a race as they ever had, in
                  all their lives before. In an instant they had gained the woods beyond the huge
                  rock by the road-side, and their course thence forward into obscurity was rapid as
                  possible. They could hear the demoniac yells their enraged pursuers uttered, and
                  the terrific sound but added speed to their feet. The men were after them,
                  however, helter-skelter, minding neither rocks, ledges, nor tree boughs. The
                  younger of the travellers became separated from his companion, in some way, and
                  his pursuers had entirely lost sight of him. They kept their eyes fast fixed,
                  though upon the form of the elder, and all his dodging behind trees, his crossing
                  and re crossing his own path, and his other ingenious subterfuges, served not to
                  conceal him from their steady view. They were on his track, fast and sure. They
                  thought they knew their man, and they were determined to have him.</p>
               <p>"There he is! Have him, boys! Don't let him slip this time! <emph>He's</emph> the
                  oneâ€”the same one!" were the now distinct ejaculations that burst with a frightful
                  meaning indeed upon his ears.</p>
               <p>"Oh, God!" groaned the pursued man to himself aloud, "Oh, God, it's all up with
                  me! I'm quite as good as a dead man!"</p>
               <p>"We have you now!" shouted one of the foremost in pursuit. "We've got you now!"
                  and he stretched out his arms towards him, as if even then he was within his
                  reach.</p>
               <p>"No, no; not quite yet!" said the pursued man to himself, as he succeeded in
                  dodging him momentarily behind the huge trunk of a tree.</p>
               <p>But despite every exertion he continued to make for his safety, they succeeded too
                  surely in capturing him. He was tired and worn, and his breath was short and
                  difficult. Accordingly, he was obliged to acknowledge himself overtaken in a race
                  where the odds were so fearfully against him. Suffering one or two of his pursuers
                  to seize him by his arms, he turned upon them with a loud voice:</p>
               <p>"Why do ye pursue me now? Do you want more money? Do you think I carry more money
                  about me than I was willing to show?"</p>
               <p>"That isn't it!" replied one of his captors; "we don't want your money, for it
                  must be precious little that such a chap as you are has got! We want to git you
                  out here into the moonlight amongst us again, and take another look at you! We
                  were so much pleased with you before, that we thought we'd have more o' your
                  company; and as we haven't got any chaplain to our company, mayhap you'll stand us
                  in need, old fellow! But where is the t'other one?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know that, sir," answered he.</p>
               <p>"You don't hey? Wal, it isn't of so very much consequence where <emph>he</emph>
                  has gone; <emph>you're</emph> the one we wanted the most!"</p>
               <p>But what of <emph>me?</emph> What do you want to stop <emph>me</emph> for?"</p>
               <p>"You'll find, when we git you out where Cap'n Jack is!" was the answer.</p>
               <p>Surrounding him, they marched him with no special ceremony over the rocks and
                  stones back to the place in the road whence he made his sudden flight into the
                  woods. There they all pressed closely about him, and began making such comments
                  upon him as their malice could best invent,</p>
               <p>"Do you want anything more of me?" asked the prisoner, affecting excessive
                  innocence and ignorance, and directing his question to him who appeared to be the
                  leader of the gang.</p>
               <p>"We'll see!" was the reply. "But what did you pay for your wig? 'Pon my soul, but
                  it's a fine wig, isn't it!" and he commenced stripping it off his head.</p>
               <p>The prisoner turned pale, and his heart palpitated a fear he could not
                  control.</p>
               <p>"And these whiskers are <emph>very</emph> good growers!â€”and <emph>so</emph>
                  nat'ral!" exclaimed another, pulling off a huge pair of false whiskers from either
                  side of his face.</p>
               <p>"Why this white neckcloth, too?" asked a third, unfastening it and revealing the
                  proper and somewhat peculiar shape of the prisoner's throat.</p>
               <p>"Verify!" exclaimed the leader of the gang, "you <emph>are</emph> a precious
                  scoundrel! <emph>Old Verd-Antique,</emph> for all the world! Who'd ha' thought
                  he'd turned minister so soon? Who'd ha' thought he had a son so likely as that
                  feller he was piloting to some point below! Old Verd-Antique, as I live!"</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, began Verd-Antiqueâ€”for he it was who had up to this moment succeeded
                  in maintaining his ingenious disguiseâ€”gentlemen. I know I am in your power; but I
                  claim the right to be treated as becomes <emph>a man</emph>â€”a human being!"</p>
               <p>"Yis, yis! You shall git all the good treatment you deserve!" answered the captain
                  of the gang. "You shall have all your wants fully attended to! Bring him along,
                  men!"</p>
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6939-00000028"/>
               <p>"But where will you take me? You know that I have done you no wrong! I demand my
                  liberty!"</p>
               <p>"Liberty!" exclaimed the leader, contemptuously. "Your <emph>liberty!</emph> Who
                  has learnt <emph>you</emph> the meaning of such a word? No! you shall receive the
                  reward you have merited so long! Come!"</p>
               <p>"If you harm a hair of my head, I swear that I will have my revenge on youâ€”every
                  one of you! Do you hear? Am I to be hunted down like a wild animal? Is there no
                  path I can be allowed to travel in peace?"</p>
               <p>"Come; come along!" answered the leader.</p>
               <p>The men set upon the prisoner, on hearing this command, in a particularly
                  ferocious manner; seizing him by his shoulders, arms, coat collars, and head, and
                  dragging and shoving him along most unmercifully. In this manner they escorted him
                  to a level, plain-like spot at a little distance below, and just beside the road,
                  where they halted and began to make preparations for some new ceremony.
                  Verd-Antique regarded them with intense anxiety, for he feared, as he had abundant
                  reason to do, that his time had really come. One of them drew a long coil of rope
                  from his pocket, or from some other equally mysterious place, and proceeded to
                  make one end of it fast to the overhanging bough of a stunted apple-tree.
                  Verd-Antique was not so blind but that he could see the noose at its other
                  extremity, and he knew that his fate was hard upon him.</p>
               <p>"This way!" ordered the leader, hurrying him along to the spot. "Try on
                     <emph>that</emph> collar, now, and see if it's any easier than the neckcloth of
                  a minister!"</p>
               <p>"But you don'tâ€”â€”." Verd Antique was going to protest, more for the hope of gaining
                  time than any thing else.</p>
               <p>"Not a word from your cursed lips! In with your old headâ€”in with it! Stand up on
                  this board!"</p>
               <p>They had rigged a small platform without uttering a syllable, and placed the ugly
                  rope about his neck. The leader stood ready at hand to draw the noose tighter, as
                  soon as he should have slipped his head within it; and, in a moment more, every
                  preparation for the hasty ceremony was complete.</p>
               <p>"Now, if you have any prayers to say," ordered the leader, "be saying the same
                  quick! There's no time to loseâ€”we must go about bigger and better business
                  to-night! And yet we couldn't have passed by such a duty as this is, when it's so
                  exactly in our way!"</p>
               <p>Verd-Antique bowed his head low in the attitude of supplication, continuing in
                  this position for several minutes; during which time the entire gang engaged
                  themselves in promiscuous and somewhat boisterous conversation. Of a sudden,
                  however, quicker and more unexpectedly than a loud peal of thunder out of a
                  bright, clear sky, there came about the ears of all of them such a terrific yell
                  that their hearts misgave them for the time, and they stood staring about them
                  like men demented entirely. Again, and yet again, came the shoutâ€”a shout as from
                  the throats of an impetuous army. It curdled their blood as it ran; it stopped
                  their breath as it came. They had dreamed of nothing so much as perfect security,
                  and now there was nothing save imminent danger about themâ€”nay, close upon
                  them!</p>
               <p>In an instant almost, there rushed in upon them a band of armed men, having their
                  leader mounted, who advanced with fixed bayonets, and shouted to them at the tops
                  of their voices to surrender.</p>
               <p>"Kick away the platform!" ordered the leader of the skinners to the man who stood
                  next the prisoner they were about to punishâ€”"kick it down and let him swing!"</p>
               <p>At that moment, a young man from the opposite and attacking party ran up to the
                  swinging body, and severed the rope with but two gashes of his knife-bladeâ€”then he
                  proceeded to free him altogether by cutting in twain the cord that confined his
                  arms. It took but a single look of Verd Antique at the person to identify him as
                  his recent travelling companionâ€”Henry Byram. He thanked him for his kindness by
                  only a grateful look, and then, seizing a musket from the hands of one of the men,
                  he rushed on with the body of them to the onslaught.</p>
               <p>"Pour in a fire upon 'em!" said he; "give 'em hot lead!" and he fired the gun he
                  held, simultaneously with his words. Then nearly all the party discharged their
                  pieces upon the ruthless skinners, and at least a half dozen fell, dead and badly
                  wounded. Then, charging upon them with fixed bayonets, and loud orders for them to
                  surrender, they drove some of them far backwards into the adjoining wood, while
                  they succeeded in surrounding the remainder and taking them prisoners Among them
                  was the leader of the gang. He was led up to the side of the horsemanâ€”who
                  commanded the scouting party of Americansâ€”and his hands secured behind him.</p>
               <p>"Jim Marshall!" exclaimed the captain of the party to his captive, as soon as he
                  looked him fully in the face, and by the moonlight detected his well-remembered
                  features. "Are <emph>you</emph> across my path again?"</p>
               <p>The prisoner looked up to the countenance of his interogator, and recognised in
                  his captorâ€”Captain William Howe! Instantly his heart failed him, and his knees
                  knocked together as from the effects of an ague fit.</p>
               <p>It appeared that Henry Byramâ€”the travelling companion of Verd-Antique, whom in
                  truth the latter was piloting towards New York to make a visit in disguise to the
                  beautiful Laura Edwardsâ€”after having made his final escape from the skinners, ran
                  on at great speed for a long distance, always keeping by he side of the road, that
                  he might the more readily overhear the approach of friends or of danger. Very
                  fortunately for him, as well as for old Verd-Antique, he heard the voices of men
                  journeying from below at a rapid pace. Secreting himself behind a tree near at
                  hand, he listened to hear whether those who passed were friends or foes. It was
                  for sometime difficult for him to satisfy himself beyond a doubt; but at length
                  overhearing some remarks of a peculiar character, made concerning the rascally
                  British who were below, he had every needed assurance that he was in the vicinity
                  of friends. Accordingly, he hurried out from his covert, and took a position
                  directly in the front of the travelling party; at the same time calling out to
                  their commander that he was an American, and that he was an American, and that he
                  wanted help in a matter of difficulty. When the latter had heard his story,
                  leaving a sufficient guard for the prisoners he had with him, he detached the
                  remainder of his men and hurried forward at a rapid rate, under the guidance of
                  the fugitive. As has been already shown, the detachment arrived just in time to
                  save the life of a highly valuable partisan, and to break up a formidable gang
                  whose outrages would not, in all probability, have ceased with the particular one
                  in which they were fortunately prevented.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE DEATH OF THE SPY.</head>
               <p>There was an unusual bustle and confusion in the camp of General Putnam, at
                  Peekskill, one fine morning in August. The soldiers were congregating in knots in
                  one place and another, busily engaged in talking over some new piece of
                  information that had but just reached them. It was as lovely a morning as ever sun
                  shone down upon. The magnificent highlands were severally wreathed at their
                  summits with volumes of the whitest mist, which, as the rays of the sun penetrated
                  them, rose with majestic sweeps, and slowly lifted themselves up into the heaven
                  whence they came. The noble Hudson glistened in the newly risen sun, like a huge
                  pathway of liquid silver. Its waters slept in beauty, mirroring in their pellucid
                  depths the thousand tints, and forms, and figures, that every where seemed to
                  crowd forward to git a glimpse of themselves in its bosom. One could not have
                  stood on the heights of Reekskill on that morning, and gazed steadily into that
                  majestic river, with out dreaming. All fancies, all thoughts, all hopes seemed
                  suddenly to spring, as by inspiration, from its broad waters.</p>
               <p>The grain stood, dew-laden, upon the many hill-sides that were within sight, and
                  the vast meads and plains stretched away before the eye, bestudded and bedecked
                  with beds of countless uncrushed diamonds. From cloud to earth the eye ran in
                  delighted haste, nor ceased its wanderings until it lay again quietly and dreamily
                  upon the slow-sweeping river. Ittran up the precipitous mountain sides; along the
                  vista of mean and plain; far off over the towering highlands; then back by the
                  sweeping mountains again; down their green-clad sides; along the tops of their
                  forests; and down along the path of the singing, silvery river. It was truly a
                  view in which the sight might long revel, and yet never be fully sated. It
                  produced, first, a glowâ€”then, an inspirationâ€”then, an intoxication of the brain.
                  Through the same eye that gazed upon it with such satisfaction, a soul looked and
                  longed with the most ardent and almost uncontrollable impulses. There was not only
                  poetry in the surrounding scenery; there was sublimityâ€”true, high, heaven-born. It
                  stirred the heart to noble thoughts. If it intoxicated, even its excess could
                  never deaden. It but awakened to loftier purposes; filled with higher hopes; fed
                  with purer thoughts; animated with stranger resolutions; breathed with fresher and
                  more invigorating breaths.</p>
               <p>The camp was early astir. Men examined their trusty firelocks, and burnished up
                  their bayonets. There was a new life on every countenance. There was a fresher
                  glow on every check. Some walked about in haste, and talked with one another in
                  quick and earnest whispers. Some held short and hurried conferences with their
                  immediate commanders, and then moved rapidly away to their stations again. It was
                  evident from what was going on, that an event of more than usual interest was
                  about to take place. Still no words concerning it were speken in tones loud enough
                  to betray what that event was.</p>
               <p>It was but a short time after the breakfast hour, when a man was led in by the
                  yard into the room where sat a general officer and two subalterns beside him. The
                  general officer was Israel Putnam. His companions were General Parsons and Colonel
                  Root. The appearance of the prisoner, to say the least, was much against him. He
                  was led up before the officers who formed the court, and who sat behind a table
                  standing in the middle of the room, and there confronted by them. General Putnam
                  was the first to speak.</p>
               <p>"You were taken, sir," said he, "in our camp last night, in at least questionable
                  circumstances. The guard at once distrusted you. Have you any explanation to make
                  of your being found here?"</p>
               <p>"None, except that I am an American, and therefore supposed I had a right within
                  American lines," responded the prisoner.</p>
               <p>"You an American!" exclaimed General Putnam.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, I was born in this part of the country," said the prisoner, gathering
                  courage.</p>
               <p>"But that may all be; yet you are not a <emph>patriot!</emph> You do not mean to
                  say that you help our people fight their battles against the tyrant who rules
                  us?"</p>
               <p>The man made no answer.</p>
               <p>"No, sir!" exclaimed General Putnam; "you are <emph>no</emph> American! Your are a
                  toryâ€”you are a <emph>spy!</emph> Dispute it, if you can? I give you the privilege!
                  Your time is short! Go on!"</p>
               <p>"Your excellency," began the prisoner, his countenance becoming pallid and his
                  heart beginning to fail him, "if I had thought I was not among friends I should
                  never have ventured here."</p>
               <p>"Noâ€”no! No, you wouldn't, surely!" exclaimed the General. "It'se asy enough to see
                     <emph>that!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"But I came within the camp, General, for the purpose of finding some friends of
                  mine whom I greatly desire to see. Nothing more, I assure you, was my object. I
                  came as a private citizen, and never feared harm. If I had I should have staid
                  away. I should never have come here. I had friends here whom I had not seen in a
                  long time. I was about to depart into a distant portion of the country, and
                  thought they might wish to send some word to their families and friends. Nothing
                  more than this,<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6939-00000029"/> General, was my object.
                  Believe me! I speak on my honor!"</p>
               <p>"Had you not a commission in the handwriting of Sir Henry Clintonâ€”a lieutenant's
                  commission?" was for the first time inquired by General Parsons, who sat on the
                  right of General Putnam.</p>
               <p>The man silently shook his head, intending to express a negative reply by the
                  motion.</p>
               <p>"Read that!" said General Parsons, handing him a paper he held in his hand across
                  the table.</p>
               <p>The man's face turned, if possible, more pale than ever. He was only able to
                  control his muscles sufficiently to reply:</p>
               <p>"I know nothing about it! I never saw it before! It's the work of some designing
                  enemy of mine! In deed, I know nothing about it!"</p>
               <p>"Room there! Make room!" came up in varied tones from the passage without. The men
                  about the door began accordingly to clear a way for some one, though no one seemed
                  to know who was about to enter, and a stranger, clad in British uniform, hastened
                  into the room. The gray eyes of General Putnam lit up with an altogether different
                  expression, as he glanced at the uniform of the stranger, and he bent on him a
                  look of eager inquiry. All eyes were turned steadily upon him.</p>
               <p>Immediately the stranger drew from the breast of his cost a document, folded
                  carefully in the form of a letter, and handing it to the persons who sat be hind
                  the table, remarked:</p>
               <p>"For General Putnam."</p>
               <p>The General took it from him, broke the seal, and commenced reading it rapidly. As
                  soon as it was finished, he told the stranger in a low tone to be seated, and he
                  would finish the reply needed in as short a time as possible.</p>
               <p>"You say you hold no commission in the king's at my, do you?" asked General
                  Putnam, directing the inquiry to the prisoner before him.</p>
               <p>"I do, General," was the answer.</p>
               <p>"Then just read that; see what that letter contains," said he, handing him across
                  the table the letter which the uniformed stranger had just brought in.</p>
               <p>The prisoner took it, but he was far too much agitated to read it. He merely
                  glanced his eye over the page, now hither and now thither, read the name affixed
                  to the hasty scrawl, and returned it to General Putnam without a word.</p>
               <p>"What have you to say to that?" asked the latter.</p>
               <p>"I can say nothing; I cannot help it, I'm sure!"</p>
               <p>"Where is your <emph>honor,</emph> of which you spoke, <emph>now?</emph> Hold no
                  commission from the king, do you?" and as he uttered the stinging words, he passed
                  the paper just received to his companions who formed the court. They took the
                  paper and read it with evident surprise; and yet their surprise was not unmingled
                  with a solid and secret satisfaction.</p>
               <p>While they busied themselves about the reading of this highly interesting
                  document, General Putnam seized a pen lying upon the table near him and commenced
                  writing vigorously. He prosecuted this labor to the extent, however, of only a few
                  minutes and as many lines, when his pen rested, and he threw it suddenly down upon
                  the table.</p>
               <p>"Sir," said Putnam, looking sternly at the prisoner, who quailed before his look,
                  "you know that you came into this camp for the purpose of recruiting from the
                  American ranks. You hoped to be able to obtain deserters from among our men. I do
                  not believe you could have done it, even if you had not been detected as you have
                  been. Furthermore, you came here as a <emph>spy,</emph> to ascertain our numbers,
                  and so report them to the enemy under whom you serve, and from whom you hold a
                  commission this day. Is it not so?"</p>
               <p>A moment was considerately allowed the prisoner' that he might make any defence
                  within his power or inclination; but he only preserved a doggedly obstinate
                  silence, keeping his eyes fast fixed upon the table before him.</p>
               <p>The three officers then held a brief consultation with each other, not leaving
                  their seats for the purpose, and then at length General Putnam raised himself to
                  his highest sitting posture, and saidâ€”</p>
               <p>"By the unbiassed opinion of this court, you have been pronounced <emph>a
                     spy!</emph> The punishment of such characters you know to be a fearful one in
                  both armies. You were born an American, but you have chosen to join the enemy of
                  your countrymen. There is no earthly reason why you should not have been a patriot
                  and a brave man, like the many you see at this moment around you; but you have
                  determined otherwise. What were your motives for your course, I know not. It
                  concerns me not. I can only know that you have joined the enemy, and, while
                  belonging to their ranks, have found your way into our camp, where you have been
                  taken. This abundantly proves you <emph>a spy;</emph> and as a spy you must be
                  dealt with at once!"</p>
               <p>"Is there no hope for me, then?" asked the suffering wretch, his words
                  unaccountably finding their way to his lips.</p>
               <p>"None: none at all. Hope for none, for all hope is delusive now! You had best
                  prepare for the doom that awaits you!"</p>
               <p>The man buried his face in his hands for a few moments, and spoke not a word. A
                  silence, as of death, reigned throughout the room. Every eye was fixed upon the
                  unhappy and condemned prisoner. Even the stifled breathing of the spectators could
                  be distinctly heard. Such a silence was too painful to be borne long. It was
                  beyond the endurance of nature.</p>
               <p>"Guard, clear the room!" ordered General Putnam to the guard.</p>
               <p>Instantly all the spectators that had crowded into the compass of the small
                  apartment, began to move, and in an incredibly short time there were none in the
                  room but the court, the prisoner, the stranger in British uniform, and the guard.
                  General Putnam gave a few orders to the latter in relation to the further
                  ceremonies to be gone through, and then the three officers rose and left the room
                  together.</p>
               <p>An hour passed away. Outside the building where the prisoner was confined, could
                  now be heard the steady rolling of the drum, and the tread of human feet. The
                  sound fell strangely upon the ear of the condemned man, for he well knew what a
                  fearful doom it foreboded. He moved his lips convulsively, as if in prayer; but
                  his coward heart <emph>refused</emph> to pray! it denied him in that hour of his
                  need, a boon that he might have otherwise enjoyed so much. He tried to weep: but
                  the tears burned in the depths of his eyes. He <emph>could not</emph> weep. He had
                  not the heart to weep. What a situation for a man! Deserted by his own
                  countrymenâ€”by all who should have been his friendsâ€”he has friends nowhere. His
                  friends had become his enemies; and all by the rash act which he had himself alone
                  performed. And thus he sat, reeling to and fro, distracted in mind, and thoroughly
                  sick at heart! Truly might one sayâ€”what a situation for a man!</p>
               <p>The roll of the drums became louder, and deeper, and steadier. They smote the
                  convict's heart, and he trembled for fear. Then the guard from without opened the
                  door and passed in the order: "Bring out the prisoner!" "Oh, God!" he groaned, as
                  he heard the words. But no groans could avail him anything then. With his arms
                  firmly secured behind him, he marched down the stairs, between the files of
                  soldiers that opened at the door to let him pass, and found himself at once in the
                  hollow square formed by soldiers on all sides of him, those in the rear having
                  suddenly closed up after he had gone through.</p>
               <p>On they marched, with mournful music, to the place where the execution was to take
                  place. There was not a whisper in all the ranksâ€”not a spoken syllable. The same
                  feeling that weighed upon the prisoner, seemed to have weighed also upon them.
                  Their countenances were all saddened, yet all was expressive of firmness and
                  resolution. It was indeed a sorry and a solemn sight, this man being led away to
                  his execution. The sun shone never so glorious; the sky looked never so clear; the
                  grandly rolling river looked never so limpid and beautiful. The sounds that came
                  up to them from mountain-side, from valley, from river, were sounds of peace, and
                  happiness, and love. There was no blood in the scent of the lazy gale! There were
                  no red spots upon the azure sky. The garish sun was not veiled with even the
                  semblance of a gloom. Yet must men destroy each other, that the mastery of this
                  green earth might, for only a few short years at the longest, be established.
                  Strange infatuation! Yet there was no infatuation about those who fought only for
                  their own liberties, and their own rights. Theirs was not purely a struggle for
                  masteryâ€”except the rightful mastery over their own selves. It was simply a
                  struggle <emph>to be free!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>They reached the place allotted for the execution, at last. It was just upon the
                  top of one of the most beautiful hills at Peekskill, from which was a view of all
                  the surrounding country, and of the noble Hudson for miles. The scene from this
                  point was unsurpassed. General Putnam, with his staff, and general officers, sat
                  on horseback close by, and narrowly watched the procession as it neared him. His
                  countenance was expressive of firmness and resolution. He knew that such trials
                  cost any warm and ingenuous heart a pang, but he counted likewise the greater
                  benefits that <emph>his country</emph> was finally to receive from thus boldly and
                  independently asserting her authority.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was ordered to mount a ladder that stood leaned against the boughs of
                  a tough oak tree. From that bough swung a rope, at the end of which was made the
                  hangman's fearful noose. The condemned man only gave a single glance at these
                  proparations, while his ashy pale face attested that words were beyond his reach
                  in that hour, even if they could have saved him. The British-uniformed man was
                  likewise brought upon the ground, and compelled to witness the spectacle.</p>
               <p>When at length the condemned man reached a particular round upon the ladder, and
                  the fatal noose was secured about his neck, at a signal from General Putnam the
                  ladder was knocked suddenly away, and <emph>the spy</emph> dangled between the
                  heavens and the earth! As soon as he was pronounced dead by the army surgeon,
                  General Putnam hastened to his quarters and summoned the stranger in British
                  uniform into his presence. He obeyed the summons, and stood before him awaiting
                  his order. The General seized a pen and appended a single line to the hasty scrawl
                  he had written in the course of the trial. Sprinkling it with a little coarse
                  sand, he ran his eyes rapidly over the whole again, to be assured that what he had
                  written was directly to the purpose. It ran thusâ€”</p>

               <p>Folding and sealing this exceedingly brief and laconic message to the commander of
                  the enemy's force, he gave it into the hands of the stranger and bade him depart
                  immediately to his own camp with the flag of truce; enjoining it upon him to
                  assure Gov. Tryon, that in spite of all his threats of vengeance, any one of his
                  tory new levies who might be found within the American camp, would surely be
                  brought to a similar punishment to that which he had that day witnessed. The
                  messenger departed with all dispatch beyond the American lines, glad to escape
                  from any further contact with such scenes as his eyes had quite unwillingly been
                  compelled to witness.</p>
               <p>The soldiers buried the dead, and by nightfall the camp betrayed not the least
                  evidence of having gone through such a scene so recently. The sun rolled back to
                  his pavilion behind the western hills, as quietly as if it had shone on nothing,
                  that long day, but scenes and sights of peace.</p>

               <head type="sub">MARKING THE FLOCKâ€”HEALING WITH STRIPES.</head>
               <p>THE reader must go back a little with us. When the fortunate charge of the company
                  in command of Captain William Howe had succeeded in repulsing the offensive gang
                  at whose hands Verd-Antique was about to suffer death, we have informed the reader
                  that those of the gang that were neither killed nor put to flight, were carried
                  away prisoners, with those already captured at the house of Mr. Wilson, to the
                  American camp. Among them was the notorious Jim Marshall, the outlaw and tory.</p>
               <p>All the prisoners were marched safely within the American lines before a very late
                  hour of the night, and the success of the expedition duly reported to the superior
                  officers. It was an expedition purposely got up to retaliate upon the British
                  authorities below, for their forwardness in hiring any and all sorts of characters
                  to plunder and lay waste the country within the American lines. In consequence of
                  this offer of the enemy, the entire country between the lines of the two armies
                  was almost daily ravaged by fiends in human shape. Their boldness even led them
                  within our own limits, where many a family was cruelly stripped of the last means
                  of subsistence upon which it had long depended; neither age nor sex was spared.
                  The savage ruffians had no hearts for pity and no ears for the petitions of
                  innocence. They were dead to any of the commonest feelings of our nature. And,
                  under pretence of executing only such orders as those they received from their
                  more inhumane employers, they were guilty of atrocious barbarities such as now
                  send a shudder of horror, indignation, and disgust through the heart of the reader
                  or the listener. We must blush for human nature, when we see recorded such
                  shameless acts, their authors incited thereto only by the most grovelling avarice
                  and the most brutal lust that anywhere ever defaced the page of civilized
                  history.</p>
               <p>When all arrived at the camp, or the rendezvous within the American lines, the
                  prisoners were secured and conducted to a place of rest. The British officers were
                  treated with all the consideration due their rank and station, while the villanous
                  skinners were bound hand and foot and placed on the ground beside the soldiers who
                  guarded them. They were bidden to take especial care of the leader of the corps,
                  Jim Marshall, for Captain Howe could tell of a certainty that he was a slippery
                  fellow and needed close attention.</p>
               <p>All went off well, however, during the remainder of the night, and Captain Howe
                  made preparations early in the morning to accompany all his prisoners up to the
                  head-quarters of the General, where likewise was to be found his Colonelâ€”the
                  gallant and brave Colonel Meigs. They were soon after breakfast up on the march,
                  hurrying forward at the same rapid pace as on the eventful night before; and, by
                  nine o'clock, they had reached head quarters, without meeting with any special
                  incident or accident.</p>
               <p>The result of their expedition being duly made known to General Putnam, the old
                  hero expressed himself greatly pleased with it; and added that such measures of
                  retaliation would be the only ones, after all, that would be likely to open the
                  eyes of the British commanders to what was due to the peaceful Americans who lived
                  between the armies. He likewise complimented the youthful Captain Howe upon his
                  courage and perseverance, and hoped that he should continue to grow as he had done
                  in his warm esteem.</p>
               <p>The prisoners were all drawn out in order one afternoonâ€”it was but a few days
                  after their sudden captureâ€”the skinners being placed on one side, and the British
                  officers over against them. Major Templeton was not among his brother officers,
                  having escapedâ€”as we omitted to say beforeâ€”in the confusion created by the sudden
                  fainting of Miss Alice, and before the soldiers came upon the building. General
                  Putnam advanced on horseback to the front of the square that surrounded them, and
                  spakeâ€”</p>
               <p>"Fellow soldiers, I am going to say a few words to you all. You have done your
                  duty well in successfully securing the persons or these British officers; but you
                     <emph>more</emph> than did your duty, when you brought in with you, after a
                  hard skirmish, three infamous cow-boys? They are villainous wretches, unfit to be
                  classed among human beings! They are not worthy of being treated as prisoners of
                  war, and yet they cannot just now be considered spies, although I have no fears
                  about their turning <emph>anything</emph> that is for their interest. What shall I
                  do with them?"</p>
               <p>It was an unusual thing, for a man who followed so implicitly his own impulses
                  (and they were not blind impulses, either) as did Israel Putnam, to make an appeal
                  for advice to the troops under him; yet in this instance he felt that such an
                  appeal was not without its wholesome effect. He was willing for once to give up to
                  the unreserved wishes of his trusty men. Accordingly, he paused for a few moments
                  upon his question, to give them an opportunity to reply.</p>
               <p>"What shall be done with them?" asked he a second time, seeing that they hesitated
                  about making him a reply.</p>
               <p>"Tie 'em together!" shouted some.</p>
               <p>"Duck 'em in the pond!" said others.</p>
               <p>"Tar and feather 'em!" cried out others still, taking manifest courage, now that
                  the ice was broken.</p>
               <p>"Tie 'em, and flog 'em bareback!" answered others still.</p>
               <p>The idea seemed to find its way within the minds of all of them just at the same
                  moment; and that moment, when the words were uttered. So they instantly joined in
                  an almost universal cryâ€”</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes! Tie 'em, and have 'em flogged!"</p>
               <p>"Very well, my lads'" exclaimed General Putnam. "It shall be exactly as you say.
                  They shall be tied up and floggedâ€”flogged in the presence of those who set them on
                  to such deeds, and who might well be made to take their share of it along with
                  them!"</p>
               <p>Hurried preparations were instantly made, therefore, to carry out the decree of
                  the soldiery. The desperadoes were marched out before the who in single file,
                  their hands fast behind them. There grew a dozen treesâ€”wild and crabbed fruit
                  treesâ€”not far off and to these the offenders were conducted with due diligence and
                  dispatch. Their hands were now taken from behind them, slung together at the
                  wrists, and in this condition made fast to a bough above them. At each tree was
                  placed a single prisoner, that the operation might be performed thoroughly and so
                  as to favor the observation of all. Then their clothes were stripped clean from
                  their brawny backs, and the field lay open and clear.</p>
               <p>A bundle of limber birch twigs, lithe and long, was provided for each victim, and
                  a soldier detached to perform the service. They stood by the side of the
                  renegades, while the remaining prisonersâ€”the British officersâ€”were led along
                  before them. Then they were stationed where a sight must be had of the whole
                  proceeding. It cost them many a pang to humiliate themselves so far as to witness
                  such a ceremony, and their pride was none the less wounded at being brought into
                  such close contact with men they despised, however much they might, for sinister
                  purposes, he disposed to tamper with them. But Gen Putnam knew all this from the
                  beginning, and determined to avail himself of his knowledge.</p>
               <p>As soon as all was in readiness, a soldier (as we have said) being stationed at
                  each man with the bundle of birches in his hand, General Putnam gave the order
                  from his saddle.</p>
               <p>"Lay on, my lads! Don't spare them! Brand them with marks deeper than that of
                  Cain!"</p>
               <p>At once the long twigs began to cut the air, and stripe the backs of the victims.
                  The latter doubled, and writhed, and twisted under the infliction, their features
                  most fiercely and fearfully contorted; some hanging their tongues out of their
                  mouths, and some gritting and gnashing their teeth together in unsufferable agony.
                  But their tormentors saw naught of all this. They were intent only on doing their
                  duty, thoroughly and well. And now the groans of the wretched victims could remain
                  pent up no longer. They found vent as best they might. It was beyond the power
                  even of an <emph>in</emph> human nature to endure all this, and not flinch, not
                  cry aloud. And the yells and cries of agony that then went up from that small
                  apple orchard, may be compared to just nothing else but themselves. There was
                  nothing else like them in all the world.</p>
               <p>The red blood began to follow the blows, and the bent backs of the renegades were
                  as striped as our national flag. They writhed and twisted their bodies about, too,
                  so fiercely, that it seemed as if they must have taken themselves entirely out of
                  the clothes that still remained upon them. The beads of sweat stood thickly on
                  their temples, and then dripped like rain, drop by drop, down upon the ground.
                  They began to beg; but they were told that prayers and petitions were things they
                  themselves had never been accustomed to listen to, and they need not expect to
                  benefit themselves from the use of such supplication now. So they ceased begging,
                  and took to sweating blood and rain again. For many minutes this sort of activity
                  continued, during which the countenances of the British prisoners were overcast
                  with looks of anger. Involuntarily they clapped their hands to their sides, as if
                  in search of their swords; but they did so only to learn that they were prisoners.
                  General Putnam at this period rode up near them, and pointing in his earnest
                  manner to the flogging that was going on, remarked to them:</p>
               <p>"These are the miserable wretches you hire to do your lawless work! These are the
                  creatures that rob, and burn, and pillage, and destroy! They know no mercy, they
                  scarcely know <emph>humanity.</emph> They spare neither innocence nor beauty! They
                  are outlaws, and it is only by <emph>your</emph> commander, that they are hired!
                  If <emph>real</emph> justice were to be done, they who <emph>instigate</emph>
                  these men to their cruel work are the ones that should suffer! <emph>They</emph>
                  should be tied up by the hands as these ignorant creatures are, and made to take
                  the same stripes with them! If ever you get back to your camp again, tell them so
                  from me! Tell them that Israel Putnam thinks <emph>they</emph> deserve the same
                  punishment you have seen inflicted on these wretches they employ!"</p>
               <p>He rode to the rear again. The birch twigs had all been used up, and the
                  flagellation ceased. Every man was deeply striped, however, by the process, and
                  the agony he suffered was abundantly shown by the contortions they had not the
                  ability to avoid.</p>
               <p>When all had been housed again and securely placed under guard, the general
                  officers held a consultation together in relation to the disposition of them. To
                  this conference Captain Howe, being the captor of the gang, was invited with the
                  rest. Many propositions and plans were brought forward by one and another, some
                  suggesting that it would be better to whip them out of the camp, as soon as they
                  should recover sufficiently to endure another infliction of the rodâ€”some proposing
                  to chain them to heavy logs of wood and make them march at the head of any company
                  that might accidentally be brought into contract with their companions againâ€”and
                  others thinking it better to keep them confined until then shoold have an
                  opportunity to make salutary examples of them, as had in a measure been done that
                  day. It was finally agreed, however, upon the request of Captain Howe, that Jim
                  Marshall, the leader of the party, should be brought into their presence at once.
                  A soldier was dispatched for him, and in a short time both returned. The outlaw's
                  back was recovered, after the striping it had had, and he walked across the room
                  where the officers sat with a gait betraying the acutest suffering. His brow was
                  lowering, and his eye looked never so wicked before to his old acquaintance,
                  Captain Howe. He glanced rapidly about the room, and his eyes fell on the face of
                  his enemy, the youthful captain. Instantly he dropped his gaze to the<pb n="60-61"
                     xml:id="VAC6939-00000031"/> floor, and a dark shadow seemed to settle on his
                  countenance.</p>
               <p>"You have received, sir, but a part of the punishment your infamous conduct
                  deserves," said General Putnam, addressing him, "and the remainder may yet be to
                  come. You are an outlaw to your own race, having joined hands with a gang of
                  lawless villiansâ€”all robbers, and hang-dogs, and cut-throats! Now I consent to
                  make you a proposition. If you accept it, you may yet become respected by those
                  who know you. If you conclude <emph>not</emph> to accept it, however, you may be
                  sure that the balance of your punishment will be somewhat less endurable than what
                  you have been called to go through to-day!"</p>
               <p>Marshall looked up inquiringly into the face of the commander while he heard him
                  utter these words. He appeared to desire nothing so much as to know what the
                  alternative was, that was about to be presented to him.</p>
               <p>"If you will at this moment take the oath of allegiance to the American cause, and
                  join a party I am about to send below in quest of others of your old companions,
                  your freedom shall be guaranteed to you. Do you do it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes!" quickly responded Marshall.</p>
               <p>"Bring a Bible!" ordered the General at once; "we will have this man sworn without
                  delay, and make <emph>an American</emph> of him, as he was <emph>born</emph> to
                  be!"</p>
               <p>A Bible was brought, the outlaw repeated the words of an extempore form of an oath
                  after the General, kissed the Holy Book, and sat down</p>
               <p>"This very night, towards sunset," continued General Putnam, "there will advance a
                  party some distance beyond our pickets below. You will go with them, and at once
                  prove the validity of your oath and the genuineness of your new allegiance, by
                  fighting bravely against your old friends. Hold yourself in readiness, therefore,
                  to depart by five o'clock.'</p>
               <p>He rose from his chair, and in company with his adjutant walked out of the room.
                  One by one the other officers dropped away after them, until no one was left in
                  the room but the unhappy man himself. A sentinel was stationed at the door, to
                  keep him in safety until the hour of his departure should finally come.</p>
               <p>At five, punctually, the party prepared to move. It was commanded by Captain Howe,
                  as before, who likewise rode on horseback. Marshall was made to walk close by his
                  side, and the least of the Captain's anxiety was the fear that he should get away
                  from them. Night overtook them many miles below headquarters; still the outlaw
                  marched trustily and unflinchingly by the side of young Howe. They quickened their
                  pace, desirous of taking advantage of the darkness caused by the gathering clouds
                  that concealed the full face of the moon. They kept on in silence, no sound
                  reaching the ear but the cautious, yet firm, tread of the men, or the occasional
                  clicking together of the hoofs of the steed ridden by their commander. In this way
                  they went along for a great distance, all eyes wide opened to see unexpected
                  sights, all ears pricked up to catch the first faint sounds of a retreating or
                  advancing enemy. But it appeared as if there would be no brush with any party that
                  night. It was just the night, too, for the passions of the brutal cowboys to let
                  themselves riot at their pleasure, and Captain Howe was unwilling to believe that
                  he should not, in the due course of time, stumble upon some adventure.</p>
               <p>He suddenly raised himself in his saddle on seeing the faint streaks of a distant
                  light gleaming through the trees, and gazed steadily in the direction whence it
                  proceeded.</p>
               <p>"March! Forward, boys! Forward!" ordered he, turning round upon his horse, and
                  speaking to his company in a voice little above a hoarse whisper.</p>
               <p>They obeyed the order like men trained to obedidience; and, as they rose upon a
                  piece of higher ground, the glare of the fire for the first time fell upon their
                  view. Instantly they became so deeply excited, that it required all the
                  self-control of which they were capable, to keep them from breaking into an
                  outright run. Onward they marched at the same quick pace, until they had come
                  within sight of the burning object; it was a comfortable farm house, which the
                  ruthless outlaws had kindled, driving out the beggar-made inhabitants before
                  them.</p>
               <p>"Will you fight now?" asked the officer of Marshall, leaning suddenly down and
                  whispering in his ear.</p>
               <p>"You may try me!" was the laconic reply.</p>
               <p>"Forward, boys!" shouted he to his company; "at them with your bayonets! Give them
                  quarter, and take all prisoners! Charge on themâ€”charge!"</p>
               <p>The words seemed to act like magic on them; for as soon as they were pronounced,
                  the same men who but a moment before marched in regular and precise array, flew
                  like so many devils let loose, uttering the loudest and fiercest yells, and crying
                  out to their enemy in syllables that would seem to belong only to the lips of
                  fiends incarnate. Over rocks and stumps they flewâ€”driving straight onward toward
                  the objects of their hostility. About the burning house were still loitering the
                  rascally gang, who no sooner heard the sudden yells of their pursuers, than they
                  shouldered their arms and ran at the top of their speed. The soldiers, however,
                  were after them in hot haste; and foremost among them, although he cautiously kept
                  as far from the rest as consistent, was Jim Marshall. Yelling louder than any one
                  of the rest, while he was within their sight and hearing, he plunged fiercely in
                  amongst the enemy, and at length seemed outstripping even <emph>them</emph> in his
                  speed.</p>
               <p>"He's left us! He's gone! After him, with the rest!" shouted Captain Howe from his
                  horse, his quick eye detecting the exact state of the case. He put spurs to his
                  steed, and rode on; but the road was no longer as good for horses as for men, and
                  they were nearing a ledge with all possible speed.</p>
               <p>"Cut him off before he reaches that ledge! Fire upon him! Down with him!" screamed
                  the captain at the top of his already hoarse voice. On the instant, three or four
                  trusty fire-locks were snapped and the pieces discharged; but it was not possible
                  to see that any or all of them had brought down the object at which they were
                  levelled.</p>
               <p>Still the outlaw sped. On and on he ran, now separated entirely from the others,
                  and seeking security among the rocks and trees which he had already reached. He
                  felt that there was no comparative safety for him in any hiding place he could
                  discover in or about the ledge, and he hurried on, already nearly out of breath,
                  for the dense wood that crowned the whole. Once beneath the covering of its ample
                  shade, he felt in a measure safe; yet he crowded on with the same speed as
                  before.</p>
               <p>Seeing that their chase was likely to prove fruitless, the party of Americans
                  reluctantly returned to the scene of the conflagration. A poor girl stood
                  shivering near the flames, scantily clothed, and protecting, or trying to protect,
                  a handful of young children. She herself could not be more than sixteen or
                  seventeen years of age, and her countenance wore every mark of the deepest sorrow.
                  Captain Howe kindly approached her, and asked her in relation to the matter of the
                  conflagration; and from her pale, thin, quivering lip, for the first time learned
                  the in human sufferings to which they had been relentlessly driven. The ruffians
                  had broken into the houseâ€”her father had joined the enemy, and her mother was
                  goneâ€”she being the oldest member thereâ€”stole all the property they wanted, and
                  then wantonly set fire to the only protection they had to their heads.<ref
                     rend="super" target="#note_010" xml:id="return_010">*</ref>
                   The soul of the young man flamed with indignation as he heard her
                  narration, and he was doubly stirred in his desire of vengeance for the shameless
                  wrongs these marauders were guilty of. As soon as it could be done he assisted the
                  sufferers to a place of safetyâ€”to the house of a neighbor fully a mile distantâ€”and
                  there left them for the night as comfortably provided for as they consistently
                  could be. Then they acoured round in the vicinity of the ruin, always keeping away
                  from the glare of the light by which their figures might be reflected more
                  plainly, until they gave up all hopes of finding any of the gang about the place
                     <emph>that</emph> night.</p>

                  <p><ref target="#return_010">*</ref>Such excess were, at the period of our story, by no means uncommon in the
                     'neutral ground.' Colonel Humphreys, a member of the military family of
                     General Putnam, and likewise the author of a warm-hearted biography of his
                     old commander, writes thus respecting the deeds of these outlaws: "Mr.
                     William Sutton, an inoffensive man, a merchant by profession, who lived in a
                     decent fashion, and whose family had as happy prospects as almost any in the
                     country, upon some imputation of toryism went to the enemy. His wife,
                     oppressed with grief in the disagreeable state of dereliction, did not long
                     survive. Betsy Sutton, their eldest daughter, was a modest and lovely young
                     woman, about fifteen years old, when, at the death of her mother, the care
                     of five or six young children devolved upon her. She was discreet and
                     provident beyond her years; but when we saw her, she looked feeble in
                     health, broken in spirit, wan, melancholy and dejected. She said that "their
                     last cow, which furnished milk for the children, had lately been taken
                     awayâ€”that they had frequently been plundered of their wearing apparel and
                     furniture, she believed by both partiesâ€”that they had little more to lose,
                     and that she knew not where to procure bread for the dear little ones, who
                     had no father to provide for them"â€”<emph>no mother,</emph> she was going to
                     have said, but a torrent of tears choked articulation.</p>
                  <p>"In coming to that part of the country again, after some campaigns had
                     elapsed, I found the garden overgrown with weeds! Upon inquiry, I learnt,
                     that as soon as we left the place, some ruffians broke into the house while
                     she lay in bed, in the latter part of the night; and that, having been
                     terrified by their rudeness, she ran, half asked, into a neighboring swamp
                     where she continued until the morning; there the poor girl caught a violent
                     cold, which ended in a consumption. It finished a life without a spot; and a
                     career of sufferings, commenced and continued without a fault!"</p>
               </note>
               <p>"By Heavens!" muttered Captain Howe between his teeth to himself: "but I'll surely
                  have him again! He may escape me this once, but never again! <emph>never
                     again!</emph>"</p>
               <p>As he repeated the words, "never again," his whole frame shook with emotion. He
                  looked sternly upon the ground, and his teeth involuntarily ground themselves
                  together. His rage was thoroughly aroused, and could he but have seen his most
                  dreaded enemy, Jim Marshall, within sabre stroke of him, it would have afforded
                  him infinite satisfaction to cleave his skull with a passionate blow.</p>
               <p>Let us follow the outlaw himself.</p>
               <p>When he found that he had at length reached a point of safety within the friendly
                  covering of the woods, and heard the tread of his pursuers grow fainter and
                  fainter as they turned back from their fruitless chase, he sat himself down upon a
                  moss-covered rock he found well concealed in the thick underbrush, and began to
                  congratulate himself on his escape. The recent wounds upon his martyred back still
                  smarted amazingly, but they brought sweeter thoughts to him, after all, for they
                  suggested plans and purposes of vengeance at no very distant day. He inwardly
                  cursed his fate; and yet he inwardly swore that the wrongs he had but just
                  received, should be repaid upon their chief distributor four fold. Just at that
                  moment the clouds broke away from before the face of the moon, and a rift of clear
                  light was seen struggling to make itself larger.</p>
               <p>"A streak of better luck!" exclaimed the outlaw aloud, obedient to the
                  superstitious ideas that still kept their tenacious hold upon his ignorant
                  mind.</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes; better luck now!" uttered a voice but a few steps from him.</p>
               <p>Marshall turned round in his seat with the agility of a panther, and gazed in the
                  direction whence he supposed the voice came. His features, his figure, his
                  posture, were all as rigid and immovable as those of a statues. He was paler than
                  death; and the beatings of his heart sounded to him like the sound of thunder
                  itself. It seemed as they alone must betray him. He dared not speak; he dared not
                  move; he dared hardly to breathe. The voice was yet upon him like a powerful
                  spell. Whence came it?â€”whose voice was it?â€”was he surrounded?â€”was there an armed
                  enemy right upon him now?</p>
               <p>"Jim Marshall, don't be 'fraid! you be safe!" added the voice.</p>
               <p>"In God's name!" cried out the frightened tory, "tell me who you be! Have you come
                  to take me a prisoner! Who be ye!"</p>
               <p>"Be not 'fraid more!" returned the voice. "You be safe here!"</p>
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6939-00000032"/>
               <p>Marshall at once sprang from his sitting attitude, and rushed to the place where
                  he heard the voice. Just as he had reached the trunk of a large tree not five
                  paces from him, he was startled to see the figure of a human being suddenly fly
                  from behind its shadow. He held out his hands, and the figure sprang and clutched
                  him.</p>
               <p>It was Lariko!â€”the Indian who had hitherto been his sworn friend and companion,
                  upon the heights in the neighborhood of Ridgefield!</p>

               <head type="sub">A BRIEF AND WRETCHED FURLOUGH</head>
               <p>SPRING had come again, blowing with its fragrant breaths over mead and valley.
                  Everything had started into a new life once more. The sprays had bud ded and burst
                  in the deep forest, flinging that soft, sweet, dreamy look of green over all the
                  woods, rocks, and mountains. Winter sent up its steamy vapors from earth's warmed
                  bosom, that rose in the clouds, and were exhaled to heaven. Life was perceptible
                  in everything, from the least even to the greatest. Life shot up in every flower,
                  grass-blade, and stem. Life glowed in the genial sunshine, and the dimpling of the
                  distant brooks. Life sounded in the breaths of the wind, in the brief gusts of the
                  diminutive gale, and in the buzzing of countless insects and gaily bedecked birds.
                  The blood mounted up from the heart with a stronger beat and a quicker force, and
                  made one live quite twice as much in a single moment as he seemed to live in any
                  moment at any other season of the year; yet there were many sights, many sounds
                  many associations, and many influences alive, that in-continently caused
                  dreaminess and reflection. The haze, that at times rested like a thin veil in the
                  airâ€”the steady whirring of frogs in distant marshes and poolsâ€”the warm glow of the
                  sunshineâ€”all these predisposed the soul to a habit of reverie, which is easier
                  formed than broken.</p>
               <p>Oh! what a flood of blessed, gleaming, warming thoughts come back with the return
                  of spring! It is as if the heart was running over with emotionsâ€”all of
                  gladnessâ€”and yet the lips had no power to express a single one of them! Thoughts
                  flit through the mind as gay little humming-birds fly from flower to flower, never
                  alighting, never gaining a foothold, never leaving an enduring impressionâ€”yet
                  always suggesting the brightest fancies, always reviving the greenest hopes, and
                  always crowding to fulness with the highest inspirations. The breath of a clear
                  morning in spring has health in it for any mind that is not jaundiced beyond the
                  hope of recovery. Its bright, genial sunshine melts itself into every pore of the
                  human heart, driving out all the crudities of a long winter's indigestion, and
                  overturning all old systems of thought and forms of feeling as readily and as
                  unceremoniously as if they were good for nothing at all, and quite as easily set
                  up again as overthrown. Ideas, sentiments, feelings, affections, all rush forward
                  from the heart in a tumultuous scramble, as if the newly-warmed blood insisted on
                  expelling them from their sunless secresies, no matter in what number or order,
                  and driving them to the outer surface where the sunlight falls in its profuse
                  floods. Just so bees buzz from the entrances to their hives at the returning
                  warmth of spring, and drive themselves out of their winter hiding places with a
                  bustle of excessive gladness.</p>
               <p>Young Captain Howe stood before the door of his uncle, his gun across his
                  shoulder, and the negro Buff just behind him. The negro likewise carried a gun
                  which he was just then engaged in loading, in obedience to the orders of his young
                  master. The latter had received a furlough of a few days, and duly improved it by
                  hurrying home to the house of his benevolent old uncle. He had succeeded in
                  reaching this place only the night before. Having passed the evening in company
                  with his relative, busily employed in answering his numberless questions in
                  relation to the war, and all the skirmishes in which he had been called to engage,
                  he resolved, as soon as he had made an early breakfast, to start off for the hut
                  of the old woman, where was his greatest and most valuable treasure.</p>
               <p>"Stay, stay!" cried the old gentleman, when he saw his nephew cleaning his
                  fowling-gun, and Buff making similar preparations on his side; "not going to leave
                  me this morning?"</p>
               <p>"I was going out gunning a little ways this morning, uncle," replied the young
                  man, in quite a persuasive tone.</p>
               <p>"Gunning? What, shoot birds this early in the spring? Do you do that?"</p>
               <p>"Why not?"</p>
               <p>"Reason enough! What are the birds good good for? They're just through with
                  winterâ€”just beginning to go at making their nests. You wouldn't shoot 'em
                     <emph>so</emph> early, would you? Shoot birds so early!"</p>
               <p>"There's <emph>other</emph> game, uncle," responded the young man, evidently
                  laboring under some embarrassment. "The woods are full of game."</p>
               <p>"Full o' fudge! Why, who ever heard of the thing at this time o' year?
                     <emph>You</emph> never did, boy, I warrant ye!"</p>
               <p>"But I thought I'd just take a little air and exercise, this morning, too. I need
                  a change, uncle."</p>
               <p>"And so you do, William," replied the old gentleman; "but I want to know how, in
                  the name o' common sense, going a gunning is a <emph>change</emph> for you! I
                  should think you'd had exercise enough for <emph>one</emph> year; why not sit down
                  in the house a bit, and have a long talk all about old matters, the war, and your
                  generals, with your good old uncle? That wouldst be a <emph>change,</emph>
                  wouldn't it? Not change <emph>enough,</emph> hey?"</p>
               <p>"But, my dear uncle," protested the young manâ€”"</p>
               <p>"No, no! You needn't go to my-dear-uncleing me now, if you think to leave me in
                  this way, when you haven't been home yet a whole day! No more of <emph>that</emph>
                  nonsense, boy; you can't deceive me with it!"</p>
               <p>"I do not wish to deceive you, uncle," replied William, pausing from his work and
                  looking steadily at his respected relative; "I thought I should just like to take
                  a turn on the mountain a few hours, andâ€”"</p>
               <p>"And stay all night again, eh?"</p>
               <p>"No, not so long as that; but I promise you that I will be back soon. I promise
                  you that, uncle I am tired of seeing faces and figures, and I would like to get to
                  the woods again!"</p>
               <p>"And tired of seeing <emph>my</emph> face more than <emph>all others!</emph> Is
                  that it?"</p>
               <p>"You do me great injustice now. I meant no such thing as that by what I said. I
                  only meant to say that I should like to get into the woods a few hours."</p>
               <p>"But I want to hear about old General Putnam from you, my boy!" said his uncle. "I
                  never saw the old hero, but I've heard enough of him, and of what he's done, and
                  keeps doing; and really, boy, I feel as if I knew him quite as well as I do you I
                  want to hear more about him. Now I s'pose you can sit down just as well as not,
                  and reel off to me about him by the hour. You've <emph>seen</emph> the old fellow,
                  and I haven't. You know all how he looksâ€”how he eatsâ€”how he talksâ€”and you've heard
                  him tell stories, I haven't any kind o' doubt; and I want you to stay and talk
                  with me this morning about these things, Can't you <emph>do</emph> it?
                     <emph>must</emph> you go, after all?"</p>
               <p>"I've made a <emph>promise</emph> to go, uncle," said the nephew, forging a reply
                  which he hoped might be satisfactory with his thoughtful relative. But just as the
                  words passed his lips, he found that he had made a false calculation, and would
                  have been glad to retract them; but it was, unfortunately, too late.</p>
               <p>His uncle at once took him up, as he feared he would.</p>
               <p>"So you have been making <emph>promises,</emph> have you, boy? Promises, hey? And
                  if promises, then <emph>to</emph> somebody! Now to <emph>whom?</emph> Come, tell
                  the whole!"</p>
               <p>"You are <emph>inquisitive,</emph> my uncle," he answered, giving him a look full
                  of respect and deference.</p>
               <p>"The dickens is in the boy for impudence, I right, eously believe!" exclaimed the
                  old gentleman. "Inquisitive! Of course I am! I have a right to be inquisitive! A
                  perfect right to be! A pretty young Captain are you to tell me I'm inquisitive!
                  I'm your uncle, boy, if you are a Captain!"</p>
               <p>"And I am proud of it, too, uncle," answered William.</p>
               <p>"Come, come, come!"</p>
               <p>"What now?"</p>
               <p>"No more of your trying to flatter an old, sober gentleman like meâ€”an old
                  gentleman with the gout, too!"</p>
               <p>"Indeed, I meant anything but flattery, uncle," replied the nephow.</p>
               <p>"And does old <emph>Israel Putnam</emph> learn you to flatter? Does he learn you
                  such soft stuff as that? I don't believe it! I never thought that of him! He's not
                  the man, I guess, to give instructions in <emph>such</emph> an art!"</p>
               <p>"He teaches his soldiers anything but that," said William.</p>
               <p>"So I thoughtâ€”so I thought! He'll learn you to give the hard blows, and the
                  thumpin' knocks; but precious little stuff like palaver and flattery do ye get of
                  him, I guess!"</p>
               <p>"It is just so. You couldn't speak more truth of him, if you had been under his
                  command for years. He's a hero!"</p>
               <p>"A hero, is he? And haven't I always told you so, boy? Haven't I always told you
                  to look sharp and learn of him all he had to tell? To be sure, I have! There's
                  something to be gained by being under such a master as that! He knows what he's
                  about himself, and he means to have his scholars learn the same thing for
                  themselves, too."</p>
               <p>"That's all trueâ€”true to the letter," added the Captain.</p>
               <p>"Well, come now! throw aside your gun! You won't kill anything to-day, and if you
                  do, you'd ought to be ashamed of yourself, at this season of the year. Come, throw
                  down your gun, and break all your promises, and sit right down here with me, and
                  tell me all you have seen and done since you've been in the service of your
                  country; from the time you first 'listed to the day when you got your
                  commissionâ€”and even whether you haven't <emph>disgraced</emph> your commission
                  yet! I can't say as to <emph>that</emph> exactly! I want to find out about
                     <emph>that!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Then you will have to ask some other person than me, if you wish to be informed
                  on that subject."</p>
               <p>"That's right!â€”that's right! A good soldierâ€”a brave soldier never wants to tell of
                  his own deeds! He'd rather let them alone to do their own talking! You re right
                  there, boy!"</p>
               <p>The young man felt little inclined to prolong a conversation which he well knew
                  would result not any the more to his uncle's advantage or gratification; so he
                  preserved a silence after this last remark, and bestowed all his attention upon
                  his gun. He seemed never so busy as then upon its various fixturesâ€”rubbing, and
                  dusting, and brushing, and blowing them as if the instrument had not been down for
                  a period of five often mouldy, dusty years.</p>
               <p>"Then you won't stay?" inquired the old gentleman, suddenly looking up.</p>
               <p>"Really, uncle," said the young manâ€”â€”</p>
               <p>"Go along, then! Go right along, then! If you don't like my company well enough to
                  stay with me, I wouldn't have you stay, for all the worldâ€”not a minute beyond what
                  you want toâ€”not a minute longer."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>do</emph> like to be in your company, uncle," replied William, looking
                  all sorts of ways for a plan to get his reasoning into the head of his obdurate
                  relation, "butâ€”â€”'</p>
               <p>"Not a word, boy!" cried out the old gentleman "Not another word! Along with you!
                  Go along too, Buff! Keep a good watch over the boy; I fear he may come to mischief
                  yet!"</p>
               <p>As he pronounced these words, he propelled his nephew with playful pushes towards
                  the door, through which the latter hurried away from his tensing guardian. Buff
                  was close at his heels, and they stood on the green grass before the door, as we
                  first introduced them to the reader a little ways backâ€”Buff in the act of loading
                  his gun.</p>
               <p>"Now we'll off for the mountain, Buff," said the<pb n="64-65"
                     xml:id="VAC6939-00000033"/> Captain, casting his eyes off in the direction of
                  it. "It's a good fresh morning, and we can travel rapidly. Are you all ready,
                  then?"</p>
               <p>"All ready, massa Billy," answered the negro.</p>
               <p>"Then off with you!" said the Captain, taking up the line of march. They pursued
                  their way through a back or by-lane, running, in some parts of it, nearly parallel
                  to the village street. It was a delightful walk for such a morning, and the
                  nephew's spirits seemed to glow beneath its influences. He felt the warmth of the
                  sun upon him, and felt rejoiced; his heart expanded, as it were, with the heat. He
                  crushed the dew drops that clustered upon the grass-blades beneath his feet, and
                  they looked to him like broken pearls. There was a vigor in the very air he drew
                  in that gave a delicious excitement to his lungs; and he came very near shouting
                  aloud, to assure himself more practically that the act would be one of pure
                  pleasure. The distant mountain, upon which he bent his gaze so often, grew larger
                  and larger as he approached it, until at length he could see nothing but a very
                  small portion of a very great mass. He had come to the mountain-side, and the
                  ascent was before him.</p>
               <p>Slowly at first, and then still more slowly as they progressed, the two climbed
                  the acclivity. It was a rugged spot, and all the energies of a person were needed
                  to make an ascent at the point where, for the purpose of saving time, he had
                  started. It was an excessively long and toilsome steep; but by diligence and
                  perseverance it was finally mastered, and the young man found himself at the top,
                  just at the point where the plain before the door of the hut emerged into the
                  woods on the right. He stood still a moment and ran his eyes hastily over the
                  level, quite to the hut of the witch. Every spot about the habitation was then
                  carefully scanned, in the hope that Mary might be seen somewhere outside; but no
                  one looking like her, or like any human being, was to be got sight of.</p>
               <p>"Come, Buff," said he, turning to the negro, "I am going up to the hut, to see
                  Miss Mary. I hope she may be your future mistress!"</p>
               <p>This was greater liberty than he had ever taken with Buff's confidence before, and
                  he wondered how he came to say as much he did.</p>
               <p>"I hope she be!" responded Buff, evidently pleased with the novel ideaâ€”if the
                  exhibition of a formidable double row of teeth might be taken as an evidence of
                  such a fact.</p>
               <p>"But you mustn't tell what I've said to you, Buff, not to a living soul!" said
                  Captain Howe, desirous of having this little act of his indiscretion felt no
                  farther in its results.</p>
               <p>They were not long in reaching the door of the hut, at which both stopped a moment
                  and listened. Then the Captain rapped lustily with his knuckles upon it.</p>
               <p>"Come in! come in!" cried out a voice within, which he was very well satisfied
                  belonged to no other body than that of old Bet Miffles.</p>
               <p>Obedient to the summons, he pushed up the wooden latch and opened the door. The
                  first and only object that presented itself to him was the old witch. She sat
                  bending over her fire, of which there was but the veriest trifle at the most,
                  rubbing the back of each hand with the palm of the other, her countenance greatly
                  distorted from its wonted expression, and rolling her body backwards and forwards
                  as if in pain. The negro followed close in upon the heels of his master, and the
                  door closed of itself after them.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, Betty?" inquired the young man. "Where's Mary?"</p>
               <p>"Matter enough, God wot! Have not I trouble enough for my own self, but what
                     <emph>you</emph> must be about me to make it the more?"</p>
               <p>"Have I ever made you any trouble, Betty," asked he. "What are you talking about
                  this morning? What can you have got into your head <emph>now?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Cant a lone body like me, I sh'd like to know, go and live on a mountain, all by
                  herself, disturbin' nobody in all the world, but what they must be
                  persecuted?"</p>
               <p>"But <emph>I</emph> have not persecuted you, woman; <emph>I</emph> have never done
                  anyâ€”"</p>
               <p>"Wal, it's all the same whether you have or not! All the same!" said she,
                  interrupting him.</p>
               <p>"<emph>What's</emph> all the same?"</p>
               <p>"Everything! There's no peace for me anywhere! There isn't such a thing as real
                  happiness in this worldâ€”not for <emph>me</emph> there isn't!"</p>
               <p>"It's not <emph>my</emph> fault, I am sure."</p>
               <p>"No matter whose fault it is! No matter whose fault! I have been persecuted, my
                  life through! And now you come toâ€”"</p>
               <p>"I come to do no such thing!" broke in the young man. "I have only come up here,
                  since I came home last night, to see Mary. I suppose I can see
                  <emph>her.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"'T would ha' been much better if I hadn't allowed ye to see her at all, poor
                  thing! She should ha' been shut up, away from ye!"</p>
               <p>"Old woman," said he, "I <emph>love</emph> your Mary! Perhaps you don't know that!
                  At any rate, I never told you of it before!"</p>
               <p>"And what good'll <emph>that</emph> do? You can't <emph>have</emph> her! You can't
                     <emph>marry</emph> her!"</p>
               <p>"That is not for you to say, Bet Miffles!" replied he, with some feeling. "You are
                  nothing more than an old witch! <emph>You are not that girl's
                  grandmother!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Had a bullet pierced her, her countenance could not have betrayed a fiercer
                  internal agony than that she suffered from his words. She looked fearfully wild
                  into his face, and shaking her wizened, bony fist, half clenched, towards him,
                  cried out:</p>
               <p>"How know <emph>you</emph> that, William Howe? How know <emph>you</emph>
                  that?"</p>
               <p>"Then I have not been mistaken?" replied he, more to himself than to her.</p>
               <p>"You <emph>are</emph> mistaken," said she, and most wofully, too! Think not to
                  find out anything from her of her relations! I know that you would attempt the
                  thing, but what good can it do you? You will be none the wiserâ€”not a whit! You
                  tell that <emph>which is not true,</emph> when you say that I am not the child's
                  own grandmother! You know nothing about it! You <emph>care</emph> nothing about
                  it, only to steal her away from meâ€”"</p>
               <p>"Who has no earthly claim on her," interrupted he.</p>
               <p>"And to make my heart desolate!" she continued, heedless of his stinging
                  interruption. "I say that you <emph>shall not</emph> marry her! <unclear>She
                     has</unclear> a different lot in store for her! You know nothing of it! You
                     <emph>can</emph> know nothing of it! You must only be calm, and leave off
                  thinking to make a wife of the girl! She can never be your wife! do you hear
                  me?"</p>
               <p>"Woman," said he, "I did not mount this rugged steep on such a heavenly morning as
                  this, to listen to such objurgations from the lips of <emph>any one! I will
                     not</emph> hear them from <emph>you,</emph> at any rate!"</p>
               <p>"None of your threats, now, my brave young officer! None of your threats! Kip!
                  Kip!"</p>
               <p>The last two syllables brought down the monstrous black cat, whose name they were,
                  from her perch upon the old clock case to the middle of the floor. She stood up
                  boldly in the front of her mistress, and erected her hair threateningly all over
                  her huge person. Her eyes were like two glowing coals of fire.</p>
               <p>"Where <emph>is</emph> the girl?" asked Captain Howe, unwilling to carry on any
                  farther contest with one whom he could not help believing (because every body else
                  did) to be allied to the Evil One.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and hadn't ye better be telling me that <emph>yourself!</emph>" responded
                  she, with a show of increased fierceness.</p>
               <p>"What do you mean, woman?" demanded he. "Where is Mary? Will you tell me?"</p>
               <p>"Don't you know, then? Are you so ignorant as not to know what you have done with
                  her? Where is she, to be sure?"</p>
               <p>"You old hag!" exclaimed he, opening the door of the young girl's bedroom, and
                  finding the apartment empty, "tell me what you have done with that girl!"</p>
               <p>"What have <emph>you?</emph> Tell me <emph>that!</emph>" replied she, growing more
                  demoniac in her expression.</p>
               <p>"I don't understand you! <emph>I</emph> have not seen her! I have but just come
                  from the army! I have not seen her! I have not heard of her! I thought she was
                  hereâ€”always here!"</p>
               <p>"If it was only true!"</p>
               <p>"Do not tamper with me now, woman, for my brain will not suffer it! I assure you I
                  have not seen Mary since I last saw you too! Where is she?"</p>
               <p>"That I cannot tell. I wish I could. It distresses me soâ€”her loss!"</p>
               <p>"Is she <emph>lost,</emph> then? Have you been robbed of this, your only treasure?
                  Mary lost!" and the wretched lover wrong his hands in an agony of heart.</p>
               <p>"I have'nt seen her this three days," said the witch.</p>
               <p>"Do you tell me truly? Will you solemnly swear to what you say?
                     <emph>Truth,</emph> is it?"</p>
               <p>"Three days ago," answered the witch, "I left this but to make a short tramp
                  beyond the woods. I could not have been gone more than eight or ten hoursâ€”'twas
                  before nightfall when I got homeâ€”and she was gone!"</p>
               <p>"Did you take this black devil with you?" asked he, pointing to the cat</p>
               <p>"She <emph>always</emph> goes with me," said she.</p>
               <p>"You found her gone when you got back!" repeated he, in a voice of mingled
                  astonishment and agony; "where can she have gone?"</p>
               <p>"The merciful Lord only knows! I hope she may not have been wounded by any
                  savages; for they say they be about!"</p>
               <p>"I know! I know!" suddenly exclaimed the young man, striking his forehead with his
                  palm sharply, till the hut resounded. "I have it all! It's plain to me now!"</p>
               <p>"What is it? Tell me what!" shrieked the witch after him.</p>
               <p>But without waiting to answer her question, filled to overflow with his own
                  thoughts, he rushed from the apartment and from the hut.</p>
               <p>It was only the second day after that, that an order came to him from camp,
                  requiring him to put an end to his furlough at once; so that if he had formed any
                  plans in his mind in relation to the discovery of Mary, they must have been
                  inevitably broken up by the unexpected order which he received. With a heavy
                  heart, well nigh crushed, he hastened back to camp.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
               <head type="sub">RETALIATION.</head>
               <p>GEN. PUTNAM had broken up his camp at Peekskill, and moved down more in the face
                  of the enemy at New Rochelle, below White Plains. He was sitting in his room,
                  towards dusk, one evening, in company with two or three of his officers, engaged
                  in a conversation upon the general aspect of affairs. Presently the door opened,
                  and a man entered. His dress was a compound of everything that was unique and
                  inimitably original, beneath which the real character or appearance of
                     <emph>no</emph> man could have been detected. Stepping up to the general, with
                  the air of a man not at all abashed by the presence of his superiors, he remarked
                  in a monotonous tone,</p>
               <p>"Just from below. Robertson has ordered out a secret expedition to Coburn Wright's
                  mills this very night! Noâ€”the order was first from Tryon, but I got it through
                  Robertson. The men will be on the march very soon. They intend to be at the place
                  before midnight."</p>
               <p>"And who are <emph>you?</emph>" inquired one of the officers sitting there.</p>
               <p>"Ask the General," was the peculiarly dry reply.</p>
               <p>General Putnam could not prevent the sunny smile that had just taken shape at the
                  corner of his mouth, from spreading over the whole of his broad, good-natured
                  looking face.</p>
               <p>"This man is my best friend in these matters," said he, seeing that all directed
                  their attention to him for an answer. "His name is John Horton; you must all of
                  you know <emph>John,</emph> surely: but he goes at<pb n="66-67"
                     xml:id="VAC6939-00000034"/> times by the very original nameâ€”though nobody knows
                  where he got itâ€”of Verd-Antique."</p>
               <p>The officers looked surprised enough at each other, thinking that the ingenuity of
                  Verd-Antique's disguise should be able to deceive even such astute judges as they
                  thought themselves in such matters. Verd-Antique read their thoughts at a single
                  rapid glance, and desirous of relieving them of all the embarrassment they felt,
                  spoke up.</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, I <emph>know</emph> now that my devices are not very <emph>poor</emph>
                  ones. I have long wished to see how skilfully I <emph>could</emph> do this thing;
                  and now I am satisfied If none of <emph>you</emph> knew me, I'm sure that my
                  enemies wouldn't! I am satisfied."</p>
               <p>Verd-Antique lacked anything but a profound and available knowledge of human
                  nature, as the above remark would seem to imply. It was received by those to whom
                  it was addressed with evident satisfaction, as his own sagacity led him to
                  see.</p>
               <p>"If they have planned the burning of Wright's Mills to night,' said General
                  Putnam, turning to his companions in armsâ€”"</p>
               <p>"They have!" interrupted Verd-Antique.</p>
               <p>"Then it must be prevented!" concluded he, in his usually earnest and strong
                  manner.</p>
               <p>"It may be," said Verd-Antique.</p>
               <p>"It <emph>shall be!</emph>" rejoined General Putnam, bringing his broad fist with
                  no common force down upon his knee. "John Horton, go and summon here Colonel
                  Meigs, and Major Brown, and Captain Howe! They are to be here within the minute!
                  There is no end to these incursions," continued he, after Verd-Antique was gone,
                  "and I see for myself no way to make one. Our enemies have got more money than we,
                  and they mean to use it; and it makes <emph>my</emph> cheeks burn with shame, to
                  think that there are menâ€”American born, and American-bredâ€”who will stoop so low as
                  to take a bribe from the villains! Tryon, he'll seduce them with his flattery, and
                  his promises; and Robertson, with his gold and silver; and that villainous
                     Rivington<ref rend="super" target="#note_011" xml:id="return_011">*</ref>
                   with his lies! They approach the people in this country in every way of
                  which they can conceive! There's nothing too low for them to stoop to, so they do
                  but carry their object! I shouldn't want better evidence of the corrupt character
                  and influence of the British army, than their influence right about us here will
                  establish! It's enough to curse the name and memory of <emph>any man</emph> to
                  command such a hordeâ€”<emph>call</emph> them as rich or as respectable as you will!
                  I know Robertson well, and really I should think he would be <emph>above</emph>
                  such things! If I could but get him here before me, I'd make his ears tingle with
                     <emph>one</emph> lecture, and such an one as he would little care to hear
                  again! But there's no way to stop these aggressions of the enemy, with their
                  companies of tories, new levies, cow-boys and vagabonds, but just to adopt a
                  system of retaliation; and from this very minute, so long as my camp is fixed
                  here, I am for <emph>retaliation!</emph> No other other way, gentlemen! No other
                  conceivable way! Whip the devil with his own switches, they sayâ€”the same sort of
                  switches he cuts to whip others with! That's <emph>my</emph> policy with them,
                  after this!"</p>

                     The lies he printed relative to the Americans, their battles, and their
                     general cause, were odious and disgusting to our army, and indeed to all who
                     knew the unscrupulous character of the man.</p>
               </note>
               <p>The farther expression of his boiling feelings was effectually stopped by the
                  entrance of the three officers he had just summoned before him. They received the
                  orders he had so rapidly formed for them in the emergency, and which they hastened
                  to obey. In a moment they had left the room, and General Putnam sat in close
                  consultation with his former companions.</p>
               <p>In less than a half hour's time, three detachments of troops, each consisting of
                  one hundred men, and respectively commanded by the three officers named above,
                  started off in silence and secrecy from the camp. At their head rode their
                  commanders. We will not trouble the reader to follow them in their course, only
                  promising that they soon filed off in different directions, each keeping the
                  locality of the mills in question in view, and each determined to prevent the
                  commission of the threatened outrage. The night happened to be a fit one for such
                  an expedition, the clouds rolling thickly overhead, and the air disturbed with
                  just wind enough to prevent a sudden discovery from the noise incident to their
                  march. They came upon the enemy in sufficient time to deter them from carrying out
                  their original design, and two of the American parties skirmished sharply with the
                  same number of parties of the enemy. The third came upon the corresponding party
                  of the enemy just after they had burned the house of Mr. Van Tassalâ€”a noted whig,
                  and a vigilant committee manâ€”to the ground. It was afterwards discovered that that
                  gentleman was made to march along with them, barefoot and half naked, on a
                  freezing, chilly nightâ€”although he had but just been drawn from his bed!</p>
               <p>The Americans returned to camp before daylight, carrying with themâ€”one party
                  thirty-five, and another forty, of the prisoners they had taken. In addition to
                  this masterly stroke, they had succeeded in deterring the enemy from burning the
                  valuable property for whose destruction they had been specially sent out. General
                  Putnam heard their reports with evident satisfaction, expressing it as not the
                  least of his satisfaction that the rascally cow-boys were so many of them
                  prisoners. "But," continued he, "we haven't done with them yet! There's more work
                  to be done yet, and hard work, tooâ€”before this business is stopped!"</p>
               <p>As soon as the commandant of the third party, which had come up in time to learn
                  of the outrage dsne to Mr. Van Tassel's property and person, had reported his
                  story to the commander, the old General's eyes flashed a burning fire. The
                  wrinkles all let themselves out upon his face, and fresher and and warmer colors
                  mounted to his cheeks. His lip slightly trembled, and it was a moment before he
                  could distinctly articulate; they he observed, with a thrill of impetuous meaning
                  in every tone:</p>
               <p>"By Heaven! but <emph>that</emph> deed shall not pass unpunished!"</p>
               <p>All who heard him knew that what had been <emph>said</emph> was every whit
                     <emph>meant.</emph> There was too much directness and emphasis in the manner of
                  its expression, to admit of the possibility of an unsettled determination in the
                  mind of the speaker.</p>
               <p>On the very next night succeeding thisâ€”the weather being excessively cold and
                  inclement, for winter was now about setting inâ€”a single whale boat shot silently
                  and rapidly up into a little cove that formed one of the many indentures on that
                  part of York Island. There were but five men in the boat, and their arms were
                  working lustily at the bending oars. Their row-locks had all been carefully lined
                  and padded, to prevent noise, and their efforts produced no other sound than that
                  of the breaking and rippling of the water about the bows. A figure sat in the
                  stern, silent and thoughtful. His name was Captain Buchanan.</p>
               <p>As the boast obeyed his control, and glided into the little cove of which we have
                  spoken, his eyes pierced the thick gloom that hung before and around him, and he
                  described the proportions of a fine mansion that stood but a little way up from
                  the water. As his vision took in its entire appearance, his lips compressed with
                  the power of some determined purpose, and he carried his hand a little unsteady
                  with the tiller.</p>
               <p>"Is that the house, Cap'n?" asked one of the men.</p>
               <p>"I suspect it is," answered he, in a low voice; "but we must first land and
                  reconnoitre. We can do nothing till we see how the land lays, you know Easyâ€”easy,
                  there!" ordered he to all his men. "We are near land, and this water's still! We
                  mustn't be heard, or all may fail?"</p>
               <p>The men needed no further injunction than this. They held back the boat slowly
                  from the shore, and, by a dexterous turn of the tiller, Captain Buchanan brought
                  all alongside as handily as if he were about to board another craft of his own
                  size. The line was duly made fast to a tree near by, and the Captain enjoined them
                  to stand perfectly still until he could take a look at his matches and tinder.
                  Drawing these from his pocket, he closely examined them, and found to his
                  gratification that they were in quite as good condition as when he took them from
                  his table. He then looked at his watch. It was already eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>"Come on, boys!" said he, in a low voice. "One of you stay here to be all ready to
                  cast off when we get backâ€”the rest of you follow me!"</p>
               <p>The order was obeyed with the alarcity of men accustomed to respect, as well as to
                  obey, their officer. They sprang through the bushes after him. Presently, they
                  reached the top of the hill, where all halted.</p>
               <p>Cold though the night was, and bleak though the aspect of every created thing
                  around them, yet there was a look of decided comfort, not to say luxury, about the
                  mansion before them. It was built entirely of wood, and was two stories high.
                  Almost every species of adornment that a cultivated taste could suggest, or a
                  refined fancy supply, was to be descried about the premises. The immediate grounds
                  were laid out with much care and regularity. Parterres were arranged for the many
                  flowers and bulbous plants that were made to exhale their fragrance for the
                  delight of the inmates. Fountains were constructed in the yard, on each side of
                  the door, and but a trifling way from it. But the musical tinkle of their
                  dripping, breaking waters was not to be heard on that night. The crystal fountains
                  were sealed with the cold.</p>
               <p>Not far back of the house, in a vista of what must have been, in the summer
                  season, a beautiful drapery of green, stood a spacious summer-house, forming the
                  termination of a series of walks that threaded the entire grounds. Here must have
                  been a delicious place for a poet to dream away the lazy, lagging hours of summer.
                  Here he could drink in, undisturbed, the glowing influences of the season and the
                  scenery; the latter of which could not be otherwise than charming to every sense.
                  Quite a large portico stood supported by four double pillars, each of them fluted,
                  and ornamented at their cornices with odd and fanciful carvings. The steps were of
                  free stone, broad, clean and high. The blinds of the building were all closed,
                  except one of those belonging to a chamber window. All around the house there was
                  the silence of death. Not a light was to be seen in any of the rooms, for the men
                  now began to move stealthily about all sides of the house, to discover what might
                  be going on in any of the apartments. But they saw nothing.</p>
               <p>"Here, then," said Captain Buchanan, as they returned by different routes and
                  reported the results of their reconnoitres to him, "take you, each of you, a bunch
                  of this dry combustible, and set it at each corner of the house! I will take care
                  of the front entrance myself!"</p>
               <p>They took the stuff he handed them, and, after having first piled up loose
                  shavings, straw, and pieces of dry wood against each corner, laid the combustible
                  he gave them carefully in the heart of the whole. As soon as every preparation was
                  complete not excepting that of his own before the front door, he struck his flint
                  and steel together, and in a minute the bright sparks were creeping everywhere
                  among the prepared tinder. Then drawing from his match bundle one well tipped with
                  brimstone and sulphur; he stood near by his own pile at the door, lit the match
                  from the tinder by only a slight application, and fired the mass. Next he started
                  round the house, stopping to do similar work at each corner. In an instant, all
                  was well going.</p>
               <p>"Now to the boat, boys! To the boat!" ordered he, leading the way himself through
                  the beautiful grounds, so soon to be nought but blackened and smoking ruins.</p>
               <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6939-00000035"/>
               <p>They leaped hastily into the hoat, which shot like a sea-bird out from the little
                  cove they had entered. They then rested for a few moments upon their oars, and
                  gazed anxiously and earnestly over the low evergreens, above whose tops alone they
                  expected to make the first practical discovery of their success. For a time, no
                  unusual spectacle presented itself.</p>
               <p>"'Twould be strange if the thing shouldn't go, after all," remarked one, as
                  fearful as any.</p>
               <p>"It willâ€”it <emph>will;</emph> there's no <emph>help</emph> for it! It
                     <emph>must</emph> go!" responded another, probably endeavoring to reason
                     <emph>himself</emph> into the belief quite as much as his companion.</p>
               <p>"The wind blows, you know," said a third; "it may have blowed the fire all
                  out!"</p>
               <p>"No, no," said Captain Buchanan, evidently resolved to take things just as they
                  came, "there's little danger of the wind's blowing those torches out! They're
                  dipped in turpentine. If the wind does strike 'em, 'twill only help their
                  case!"</p>
               <p>"'Twas a lucky thought, though," added the first speaker, "your dipping 'em in the
                  turpentine."</p>
               <p>The Captain did not think it specially incumbent on him to say that he perfectly
                  agreed with the opinion of the last speaker, and therefore there ensued a silence
                  of a few minutes.</p>
               <p>"Strange enough!" said Captain Buchanan, at length, unable to restrain his
                  patience longer; he was in fact excessively anxious lest the plan might, after
                  all, through the inadequacy of his first arrangements, have fallen through.</p>
               <p>"There! There! There you are!" exclaimed one of the men, suddenly pointing
                  impatiently toward the mansion.</p>
               <p>"Yes, see there!" all seemed to respond at once.</p>
               <p>"Yes, we've got him now! This will be a good lesson for them!" said Captain
                  Buchanan.</p>
               <p>"Whose house is it, Captain?" asked one of the men, ignorant, up to this point, of
                  every thing connected with the ownership of the property, or even of the professed
                     <emph>object</emph> of the expedition.</p>
               <p>"That is the house of General Oliver DeLancy,"<ref rend="super" target="#note_012"
                     xml:id="return_012">*</ref>
                   answered the Captain, looking at the progress of matters with no very
                   dissatisfied eye.</p>
               <note place="foot" xml:id="note_012">

               <p>The fires had by this time kindled, and their hungry jaws were seizing hold of the
                  dry building with a ferocity that was insatiable. The men in the boat could hear
                  their crackling, and steaming, and hissing, and the glare that shot through even
                  the thick, dark boughs of the evergreens, fell athwart their faces, so that they
                  might readily see the expression each of the other. Presently they heard shoutsâ€”as
                  for helpâ€”from the chamber windows. They heard the windows open, and the blinds
                  suddenly slap against the sides of the house, and knew that the inmates were
                  thoroughly aroused. One turned his head partially to another, and wondered what
                  they must think, at being awakened so unceremoniously from the depths of a sound
                  sleep.</p>
               <p>Then the fires seemed to strain their wizard limbs, and erect themselves into all
                  the fantastic and fearful shapes that were properly theirs. They puffed up huge
                  clouds of densest smoke. They thrust out their long, forked, ever-playing tongues,
                  all lurid and red with heat. Through the cloud-folds, though they had been never
                  so black and so dense, they protruded their skinny, skeleton hands, to but touch
                  which were a death of terror. They raced and rolled from corner to corner of the
                  house. They climbed to the eaves, and ran rapidly along beneath them. Then they
                  mounted in their hot and uncontrollable haste to the very roof treeâ€”to the ridge
                  poleâ€”across which they sat, clapping their skeleton hands of flame, spectral and
                  gaunt, and rolling their fierce eyes about them in every direction. Again came
                  those cries for assistance. They were heard upon the water, and their faint echoes
                  died away upon its marble-cold surface.</p>
               <p>Now the flames enwrapped everything. All about the spot, where but a few minutes
                  before stood an elegant mansion, now looked a glowing mass of flame. There was now
                  no cloud of smoke. There was now no vapor, or steam, uprising from the interior of
                  the building. There was no veil of any character between their eyes and the white
                  flames. All was a seemingly solid mass of fire. It spouted upwards like the play
                  of a fiery fountain. It wheeled, and cuvetted, and wavered. Then it rolled, and
                  danced, and piroutted in the air. Then it rose grandly, towering far upwards,
                  leaping up madly, as if it would lay its hot hands upon the stars, and pluck them
                  from their quiet homes. The same cries for help could ever and anon be heard by
                  them; yet they grew less distinct with each succeeding effort. The flames played
                  along upon the surface of the waterâ€”or rather their reflections didâ€”lighting up
                  the countenances of the boats' crew with a lurid shadow, and bringing out their
                  changing expressions into a strange and unpleasant relief.</p>
               <p>"We must be gone now," said the Captain, as he laid his hand upon the tiller. And
                  forthwith all bent to the oars, and the boat was bounding over the waters at a
                  rapid rate indeed. They turned, every few minutes, and looked over their shoulders
                  at the conflagration; but they could only see that it was fast dying away in
                  intensity, while countless sparks floated upwards to the silent, bending sky. The
                  place looked to them more gloomy than ever.</p>
               <p>Early the next morning, a soldier presented himself to General Putnam, as he was
                  walking before his quarters for exercise. Touching his hat with proper military
                  respect, he saluted him with,</p>
               <p>"General, I have come to make my report to you thus early this morning."</p>
               <p>"Captain Buchanan," responded his commander "you need to be greatly complimented
                  for your punctuality. The men might well take pattern from you.'</p>
               <p>Bowing low as he received the compliment of his superior, the young officer
                  replied,</p>
               <p>"My report to you is, General, that De Lancy's house was last night burned to the
                  ground. Your orders were obeyed to the letter."</p>
               <p>Instantly the General turned and went into his quarters again. Communicating the
                  news to his brother officers in the house, who received it with undivided joy,
                  said he,</p>
               <p>"<emph>Now</emph> we shall see who is sick of this business first! I ordered that
                  expedition for the <emph>professed purpose</emph> of retaliationâ€”to avenge the
                  wrong done Mr. Van Tassel! I believe they will think it's a business that can be
                  done by us quite as well by them!"</p>
               <p>The words of the General were prophetically true. This act of retaliation, it is
                  believed, effected more in the way putting an end to these atrocious incursions
                  and robberies, than all that had been done before towards the same end.</p>

               <head type="sub">A PLOT DEFEATEDâ€”COWBOYS PENNED.</head>
               <p>A MAN emerged from the' 'Eel Pot," one evening in the latter part of November, and
                  took his way directly to the quarters of General Robertson. He knocked with the
                  old-fashioned, dog's-head knocker against the door, and immediately a negro,
                  dressed in the style of a footman, opened the same.</p>
               <p>"Is General Robertson at home?" asked the stranger.</p>
               <p>"Yaas, he be just got home from a ride," answered the negro, assuming great
                  gravity when he saw who his visiter was.</p>
               <p>"I wish to see him," said the stranger, without any farther words, pushing by the
                  negro, and stepping in the middle of the hall.</p>
               <p>"Dat's easy 'nuff done," answered the blacky, retreating to another room, and
                  managing to keep the whites of his eyes rolled on the stranger all the way. "Come
                  dis way, den!"</p>
               <p>The new comer followed the negro, obedient to his beck and invitation, and stood
                  within the doorway of a spacious drawing room. It was abundantly lighted, the rays
                  from the lamps penetrating every portion of the room, corners, cracks, crannies
                  and crevices. The countenance of the lacquey shone like burnished ebony, the
                  moment he came into the glare of the light, while his rows of teeth threw off the
                  gleams of the purest-surfaced ivory. The door, as it was thrown back, seemed
                  effectually to conceal those in the room from the view of the stranger at the
                  point where he stood, yet he heard the sound of tongues, and knew that he whom he
                  sought could not be far off.</p>
               <p>"Who is he? What does he want?" he could hear the General ask of the servant.</p>
               <p>"Sure, I don't know who he be, massa," replied the negro. "He neber tell who he
                  beâ€”neber say nuffin' what he want! Sure, massa, I tink he follow me 'long, but I
                  don't see him!"</p>
               <p>At this juncture, the stranger thought it proper to introduce himself with no
                  farther ceremony. Accordingly, still holding his hat in his hands, he entered
                  directly into the presence of the man he sought.</p>
               <p>General Robertson was sitting at table, and three or four companions, evidently
                  officers also, were with him. The decanters of clear wine stood before them, and
                  their glasses appeared freshly primed for a new attempt upon the generous liquor.
                  It stood in their cups as clear and inviting to the intent eyes of the visiter, as
                  a glass of the purest water. All appeared to be in no unsocial mood, the juice of
                  the grapes having undoubtedly warmed their hearts to a generous and lively
                  glow.</p>
               <p>"Kit Clemm! Upon my word!" exclaimed General Robertson, as soon as he laid his
                  eyes upon the advancing stranger. The others likewise turned their heads to get a
                  view of the person bearing the name, and to hear more distinctly, as they thought,
                  the conversation of the General with him. "Well," continued the General, quite
                  unceremoniously for <emph>him</emph>â€”"well, Kit, what news do you bring now?"</p>
               <p>"I've jest come in." said the stranger. "I've been across the lines, and they're
                  makin' warm work with your tories there, I tell ye!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I supposed they wouldâ€”I supposed they would! The fact is, these fellows must
                  manage to look out for their own necks, mustn't they, Colonel?" and he turned a
                  strange look, yet one full of good nature, upon Colonel De Lancy <ref rend="super"
                     target="#note_013" xml:id="return_013">*</ref>
                   â€”the noted partisan leader. "But how's Old Put, Kit? Did ye get a look at
                  him? How is the old fellow nowâ€”and what is he stirring himself about,
                     <emph>except</emph> catching our peaceable men, and whipping the vagabond
                     tories, as he calls them?"</p>

               <p>"Yes, I saw the General," answered Kit; "he was well, to all
                     <emph>appearances,</emph> anyhow. I don't know what he's punchin' at now,
                  though. Somethin', most likely. He's none o' your idle ones, now, they say!"</p>
               <p>"John," ordered the General to the negro, who still stood behind his master, "pour
                  out my friend there a glass of wine. Sit down, Kit; we want to have your opinion
                  upon a few matters, before you leave us; you have dropped in just at the right
                  time!"</p>
               <p>The negro poured out a glass of wine and handed it to the stranger, though not
                  without a strange commentary in his mind upon the propriety of waiting upon such
                  doubtful-looking individuals with the same ceremony as he would upon outright
                  gentlemen. Taking the glass in his hand, Kit raised it before his lips, and
                  proposedâ€”</p>
               <p>"General Robertson, may you grow better as you grow older, like this wine!"â€”and
                  then drank it down at a single gulp.</p>
               <p>"Faith! but you shall have your glass filled for that a second time!" replied
                  General Robertson. "You <emph>couldn't</emph> have meant to insinuate that my ways
                  needed mending any, did you, Kit?"</p>
               <p>All his companions laughed heartily at this version of the sentimentâ€”a version
                  they had not any one of them thought to give it himself.</p>
               <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6939-00000036"/>
               <p>"Oh, no, your honor!" rejoined Kit, fearing that his simple toast should all be
                  construed the wrong way for him. "No, no, your honor; I meant onlyâ€”onlyâ€”"</p>
               <p>"I seeâ€”I see," replied the General, with a smile he in vain endeavored to repress.
                  "Say no more about it. You meant nothing, as you usually do! Is that it?" and he
                  burst out into a boisterous laugh, as if he had finally reasoned himself, if
                  nobody else, into a good humor again.</p>
               <p>"Kit, as you've just come from the American linesâ€”though, for the life of me, I
                  don't see how you can get about so and your neck not grow any longerâ€”perhaps you'd
                  like to hear a fresh word from General Putnam yourself. He writes me occasionally,
                  you see, as we were old friends in the Indian and French wars, and I'll just read
                  you a specimen. Gentlemen," continued he, turning likewise to the rest, "suppose I
                  give you the gist of my last despatch from Putnamâ€”it's Old Put all over! I could
                     <emph>swear</emph> 'twas he, even if I hadn't seen the handwriting! He goes on
                  to speak about our shamelessness in hiring these marauders that prey all through
                  the adjacent country, and then saysâ€”'Major General Putnam presents his compliments
                  to Major General Robertson, and sends him some American newspapers for his
                  perusal. When General Robertson shall have done with them, it is requested they be
                  given to Rivington, in order that he may <emph>print some truth.'</emph>

                   Now, isn't that refreshingâ€”how perfectly cool! I wonder if Putnam thinks
                  the stories the Americans tell of their battles are filled with more truth than
                  Rivington's accounts are? But he's so confoundedly American, there's no getting an
                  unprejudiced opinion out of him at all now. Here are some old copies of the
                  Connecticut Courant, a paper printed in Hartford, containing accounts of our
                  fights at Danbury, and Norwalk, and Ridgefield. But <emph>you</emph> can have
                  them, gentlemen, if you choose. I don't imagine there's any more
                     <emph>truth,</emph> so Putnam calls it, to be found in these accounts than in
                  ours; but it's all his way! <emph>I</emph> know him well! It's just his way!"</p>

               </note>
               <p>The papers were accordingly distributed around the table, and a brief examination
                  of them gone through. While they were engaged in his occupation the door again
                  opened, and in walked, with a pompous and stately air, the notorious Colonel
                  Cunninghamâ€”the man who had made himself odious to every American that heard his
                  name, by his brutal treatment of the prisoners in his charge in the city
                  prison.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Cunningham!" exclaimed General Robertson, "you are here in good time. My
                  friend Kit Clemm here is waiting for just such a man as you are. You know he does
                  the work well, and here he is ready for more, I suppose."</p>
               <p>Kit bowed, as if he were willing to be taken as meaning anything they
                  preferred.</p>
               <p>"What news with you all here, gentlemen?" added Cunningham, turning and making his
                  respects is the entire company.</p>
               <p>"A glass of wine, Cunningham! Join us in a glass of wine, Colonel!" said General
                  Robertson, pushing a chair towards him, and looking his necessary orders at the
                  negro, John.</p>
               <p>The visiter thanked his host with a civil bow, and, seating himself, proceeded to
                  pour out a glass of wine from the massive decanter the negro set before him. The
                  conversation for some time was generalâ€”on the part of Cunningham studiously so.
                  From such subjects, enlisting no very great energy or warmth from either one of
                  them, they ran on to the state of affairs around them, more particularly in
                  relation to the camp above them. General Robertson remarked that Putnam was 'a
                  bold fellow,' and as persevering and unflinching as he was bold; to which
                  Cunningham added that he had evidence enough to satisfy him that General Putnam
                  was right on <emph>that</emph> point, if on no other.</p>
               <p>"But," continued Cunningham, looking sly and knowing at the officers around the
                  board, "I have a plan in my head, and I came here to-night expressly for the
                  purpose of stating it to you."</p>
               <p>"What is it?" inquired De Lancy, interested in the earnest manner of Cunningham,
                  and knowing enough of his character and habits to believe that
                     <emph>something</emph> must now be on the tapis.</p>
               <p>"To take General Putnam!" was his reply.</p>
               <p>"Ha, ha, ha!" shouted General Robertson, throwing his head back as he exploded;
                  "but that's a good one!"</p>
               <p>"Whyâ€”what's the trouble?" asked Cunningham.</p>
               <p>"Trouble!" responded Robertson, "the trouble is <emph>to get him here.</emph> It
                  would take all the forces of the king that ever landed on this continent!"</p>
               <p>"Fudge! You have a very exalted idea of the man!"</p>
               <p>"Indeed I ought to have! I've served with old Israel Putnam long enough to know
                  that he isn't a man <emph>to be</emph> taken! Cunningham, I'll lay you any wager
                  you can't get him!"</p>
               <p>"And not interest yourself any to prevent it, and so secure your wager?" asked
                  Cunningham, ironically.</p>
               <p>"No, no! You joke; I'm in sober earnest!"</p>
               <p>"Well then, to satisfy you, I will not bet with youâ€”I will go to work and bring
                  General Putnam out of his camp to the city!"</p>
               <p>"And you shall have all the advice and co-operation I can give you," added General
                  Robertson, "for I should be charmed to have so old a friend as Israel Putnam in my
                  company as much as he would be, if you but took him. I'll help you all
                     <emph>I</emph> can. Take this man now for your work! Take Kit Clemm! He's a
                  faithful fellow, and trusty! What's your plan! Tell it!"</p>
               <p>"My men are all picked out now," said Cunningham, with an air of no little
                  satisfaction.</p>
               <p>"Where are they?" asked De Lancy, his interest in the matter visibly
                  increasing.</p>
               <p>"They are in the city to-night, awaiting your orders only," replied
                  Cunningham.</p>
               <p>"Good!' cried General Robertson, clapping his hands together. "I like you,
                  Cunninghamâ€”you have such a direct way of going about your work! Everything
                  planned, and come here to lay a wager about it, hey? Sly boyâ€”sly boy, that!"</p>
               <p>"Come, Kit Clemm! Will you go with me?" asked he, turning suddenly to that
                  individual, and setting his glass down on the table.</p>
               <p>"Certainâ€”I'm always ready to go," replied he, rising.</p>
               <p>"If you must take him with you, then," said General Robertson, "at least see that
                  you <emph>return</emph> him as safe as you found him, and don't be long about it,
                  either. He's one of my shrewdest travellers, and I can't do without him long at a
                  time."</p>
               <p>"I'll answer, General, for his safety, and remune rate you too, if you wish, for
                  the use of him," replied Cunningham, as he and Kit moved out at the door.</p>
               <p>The latter followed close on at the heels of the former, until they arrived at his
                  usual quarters. Then he went into his room with him, and was there closeted for at
                  least three-fourths of an hour. Their conference was specially secret and
                  confidential, for three or four callers upon Cunningham were unceremoniously given
                  to understand that he was then very busily engaged and would not received a single
                  visiter upon any business. As soon as the consultation was over, Kit Clemm left
                  the apartment and disappeared in a neighbouring street.</p>
               <p>The third night thereafter, nine men were concealed at about the twilight hour in
                  a small growth of wood near Putnam's quarters, thickly set in with scraggy and
                  shapeless masses of rocks. They lay perfectly still, although the night was bitter
                  cold and the wind purpled their flesh and benumbed their hands. They passed round
                  their pocket flasks, to keep up their sinking spirits, told stories with no
                  special point to them, laughed at the security the Americans at that very moment
                  felt in their quarters, and promised themselves very great fun before another
                  morning's sun should shine.</p>
               <p>"What'll you do with him to-night?" asked one of another.</p>
               <p>"Carry him beyond the lines, by all means," responded the other. "We shouldn't be
                  safe here, you ninny!"</p>
               <p>"I know that well enough; but where had we better carry him? Whose house shall we
                  quarter at?"</p>
               <p>"There's enough of 'em."</p>
               <p>"But bad we better, <emph>think</emph> of stopping?" asked another. "It'll only
                  give him a better opportunity to escape. Besides, they will <emph>miss</emph> the
                  old man by morning!"</p>
               <p>"Very true, but how far dare they come after us?" inquired a fourth.</p>
               <p>"How far! These rebel fellows would run through a fire of a mile's circumference,
                  if they only thought Old Put hud gone through before 'em!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, they're up to anything," remarked the one who favored the idea of pushing
                  straight through, as soon as they had secured their prey. "They'll look the very
                  devil out of countenance, for that matter, and fight as long as they have a
                  half-point of blood to run! And their General is just like 'em, too! In fact, they
                  copy himâ€”not he them! I'm not so very sure that the old General wouldn't turn to
                  and fight us all, single handed, if he could but get his back to a wall! What say
                  you, Kit? You've see him."</p>
               <p>"I know I have," responded the individual addressed, who was no other than Kit
                  Clemm himself, "and I know that the General fights as hard as he worksâ€”quite as
                  hard. He's never idleâ€”always doin' somethin'â€”and if he can't find any reg'lar,
                  peaceable work to do, he'll just begin fightin'! There's no tellin' what a
                  constitooshun that man's got, nuther. He's as hearty as an ox, and he never goes
                  into anything half-way. It's jest the same whether he eats, or sleeps, or works,
                  or fights; he does one on 'em jest as much work-fashion as he does the other! It's
                  all the same to him; and all I've got to say is, if you take him to-night, you'd
                  better keep movin' with him! Keep <emph>him</emph> busy, or he'll keep
                     <emph>you</emph> so!"</p>
               <p>"But we're fastâ€”too lastâ€”I think," spake up one of the party, who had preserved a
                  strict silence hitherto. "We'd better <emph>catch</emph> our game first!"</p>
               <p>"Never you fear that!" cried out one of the hopeful ones, in a hoarse whisper.
                  "He's ours sure enough!"</p>
               <p>"Counting chickensâ€”and so forth!" replied the first with a half malicious
                  chuckle.</p>
               <p>"If I go, it's time I went <emph>now,</emph>" said Kit Clemm, wishing to put an
                  end to a discussion that was exceedingly frivolous, at the best. "The old General
                  is abed by this time, I sh'd think, for he rises early. I will start off and
                  reconnoitre for you!."</p>
               <p>Before Kit made this proposition, <unclear>he had</unclear> changed his
                  appearance. The clothes worn by him from the city were now put off, and he stood
                  before them, arrayed in all attire peculiarly unique and original. No one could
                  positively have sworn to his being the same man. Upon his head was a slouched
                  felt, from underneath whose rim he looked up at his comrades with great difficulty
                  and some considerable hoisting of his head. About his body was a loose gabardine
                  of tow-cloth, fastened about the waist with a single round of common whip-cord.
                  His boots were nearly up to his knees, and drawn up outside of his pantaloons.
                  About his neck he wore a coarse neckcloth, looking as if it were heavily wadded
                  with cotton, and tied with the knot almost or quite beneath the left ear. His
                  expression appeared dull and inclined to sottishness. He seemed to observe
                  nothing, and to be in all respects a good example of a good, clever, honest
                  backwoodsman. He astonished those who saw what a transformation the man was
                  capable, with the assistance of a little ingenuity, of undergoing. Waving his hand
                  to the party, he assured them that they might look for him in a few minutes, if
                  nothing happened to him, and then they should all be led on to the undertaking on
                  which they had come.</p>
               <p>The quarters of General Putnam were in an old, brown house, with but two stories
                  in the front and<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6939-00000037"/> but one in the rearâ€”the
                  rear roof running off at such a gentle declivity, and reaching so near down to the
                  groundâ€”just over the back doorâ€”that the space therein was good for nothing but a
                  garret, and poor for that. General Putnam was sleeping in the front corner room,
                  by himself. All this was perfectly well known to Kit Clemm by some meansâ€”he, by
                  the assistance of his disguises, being able to appear in both camps as a friend to
                  both causesâ€”and he advanced towards the house with an assured air. He did not by
                  any means disregard the figure of the sentinel, walking his watchful rounds before
                  the house, but stood prepared to reply to the very important inquiry he might be
                  about to make.</p>
               <p>"Who goes there?" suddenly demanded the wide awake sentinel, bringing his arms to
                  a 'present,' to be ready for his customer, if a vicious one.</p>
               <p>"A friend," replied Kit Clemm.</p>
               <p>"Give the countersign!" ordered the sentinel, in his deep, gruff tones, that
                  seemed to come from the very bottoms of his boots.</p>
               <p>"Montgomery!" answered the passer, while he walked deliberately on, and stopped at
                  the front door of the house.</p>
               <p>"What do you want there?" demanded the sentinel, approaching him. "The General has
                  been in bed these two hours, nearly; you can't see him to night."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>must</emph> see him, at any rate," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"Come, now, old plough-jogger!" rejoined the sentinel, "I guess you'll be jest as
                  apt to sell your poultry in the morning as if you hung round here to-night. I
                  don't think the General would thank anybody for waking him up <emph>now!</emph> He
                  must be in a good drowse, by this time, and I'm not going to be the one to disturb
                  him!"</p>
               <p>"Then I am!" retorted Kit Clemm, placing his hand upon the door-latch and lifting
                  it. Before the sentinel could utter another word of protest, the stranger had gone
                  from his sight, and the door had closed upon him. He hurried to the chamber of
                  General Putnam, and entered it with no further ceremony. Awaking him without
                  difficulty, he offered to strike a light, that he might the better communicate to
                  him what he had to say. The General prevented this, however, by himself striking
                  the flint and steel that lay upon the stand at the head of his bed. As soon as the
                  light was burning, he looked at the intruder steadily, shading his eyes with his
                  hand as he did so, and then exclaimedâ€”</p>
               <p>"John Horton!"</p>
               <p>"It's old Verd Antique himself!" replied the stranger, who had dropped the name of
                  Kit Clemm at the threshold of the door, and now stood by his commander the true
                  patriot he ever had been.</p>
               <p>To General Putnam he narrated the whole plan that had been formed by Cunningham to
                  make him their prisoner, and likewise all the conversation he had heard, or in
                  which he had taken a part, in the presence of the British officers in New York.
                  Putnam appeared delighted to find Verd Antique so shrewd and collected a man,
                  expressing many times his wonder at his success in so perilous an undertaking, and
                  complimenting him upon the actual service he did for the holy cause in which he
                  was enlisted.</p>
               <p>When Verd-Antique communicated to his commander the trap into which he had
                  purposely led the party that was then out upon their expedition, the latter could
                  hardly contain himself for joy. He instantly started out of bed, rubbing his hands
                  gleefully, and promising them that they should not go back without their
                  reward.</p>
               <p>"They lie in those rocks yonder, now," said Verd-Antique. "If you take them to
                  night, it must be done now. I have made them think you are but poorly guarded, and
                  if they should start down this way before you can get a force round them, it might
                  go hard, you know, General!"</p>
               <p>"How long did you tell them you should be gone?" asked General Putnam.</p>
               <p>"Until I could reconnoitre; they'll not much expect me back before half an hour
                  from now."</p>
               <p>"And in that time they'll not expect to get back to their lines themselves!" added
                  the General. "John Horton," continued he, still busied with dressing himself, and
                  taking the precaution to secrete the candle in the fire-placeâ€”"John Horton, just
                  run down to Captain Howe's quarters, and tell him to be here in three minutes from
                  now!"</p>
               <p>The partisan hurried to obey the command. In just about the time prescribed the
                  two men returned together.</p>
               <p>"Take twenty men, Captain Howe," said General Putnam, 'and hurry round by the
                  ledges yonder! There are a handful of tories there, whom I wish to take
                     prisonersâ€”<emph>every one of them!</emph> Let every thing be done as secretly
                  as possible, and with dispatch. When you have brought in your men, come and report
                  yourself to me!"</p>
               <p>The officer departed. The success of his manÅ“uvre may best be understood, when we
                  state that he returned within half an hour to the quarters of his General, and
                  reported every man safe in the guardroom, under the care of sentinels.</p>
               <p>Verd-Antique desired both General Putnam and Captain Howe to make it understood
                  among the prisoners that he had first been captured, and made to disclose the
                  whole plot; and that he was afterwards sent away to another post, farther up in
                  the Highlands, where his very commendable zeal might be schooled under more proper
                  influences.</p>
               <p>It was on the self-same day that General Putnam received a letter from General
                  Washington, admonishing him that there was a well-laid plan on foot to make him a
                  prisoner, and carry him within the British lines.</p>
               <p>"But I rather think I've broken it up, with the assistance of my friend John
                  Horton!" exclaimed General Putnam, as he folded the billet and laid it carefully
                  away.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE TORY AND THE INDIANâ€”AN INFAMOUS PLOT.</head>
               <p>AS soon as the Indian, Lariko, and Jim Marshall, the tory, had come to understand
                  each other a little better, on the night when they met so unexpectedly in the
                  woods, the latter commenced talking of the indignities he had so recently suffered
                  from a flagellation with the hated birches, and vowing that if he did but live
                  long enough, Captain Howe would be sorry for the part he had taken in securing his
                  punishment. What his plans were he did not then see proper to communicate to the
                  Indian, but merely asked him if he remembered the girl on the Ridgefield
                  mountain.</p>
               <p>"Remember the spring-flower!" responded the Indian, his keen eye lighting still
                  more, "remember the girl of the mountain! Lariko never forget! Lariko remember
                     <emph>always!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Have you seen her of late?" asked the tory, a little inclined to dwell on the
                  subject, as if the vengeful associatious that clustered around it were well
                  calculated to allay the smarting of his wounds, while they were equally certain to
                  keep alive the smarting of his spirit.</p>
               <p>"Me see mountain flower less than a moon ago," answered the Indian.</p>
               <p>"What! Have you been to the lodge, then?"</p>
               <p>"Lariko sleep in the lodge nights! Lariko stop no where else, when he that
                  way!"</p>
               <p>"But where are you going this winter then, Lariko?"</p>
               <p>"Poor Indian go back to the woods! Pale faces care none for red-skins! Lariko go
                  far back to the Mohawk, where his brethren hunt!"</p>
               <p>"And will you promise to be back again at early spring?"</p>
               <p>"Me be <emph>sure</emph> to be back! Lariko have presents for pale face Jim!
                  Lariko be sure to be back!"</p>
               <p>The conversation continued in this strain for some time. Marshall assured the
                  Indian that he should himself go within the British lines as soon as he could get
                  there; and there he said he should stay until the spring was fairly open. He had
                  had enough of the infuriated rebels, he added, and cared to have nothing more to
                  do with any of them. He had a grudge against <emph>one</emph> of them, however,
                  and he only wanted the opportunity to occur when he might gratify it to his
                  heart's content.</p>
               <p>The two straggled off together that night, and not long afterwards the one was
                  safe within the protection afforded by the British authorities, while the other
                  was on his solitary journey again to the valley of the far-off Mohawk.</p>
               <p>Just as soon as the open, clear weather of spring had begun to settle itself upon
                  the earth, Jim Marshall took such by-paths over the hills and across the country
                  as were known only to him, and in which he had no cause to fear discovery, and,
                  after a week's cautious travelling, succeeded in reaching the hut of which we have
                  spoken, situated about a mile from the habitation of the witch, in the depths of
                  the forest. He at once sat about making himself comfortable in his domicil,
                  expecting that the Indian would join him ere long at this their common rendezvous.
                  Nor in this expectation was he disappointed. It was not many days before Lariko
                  returned from his winter campaign at the northward, and presented himself at the
                  door. The surprise of each, at seeing the other, was great, and their mutual
                  congratulations were not all fully exchanged in the space of a whole hour.
                  Marshall had to recount all the experiencesâ€”not very varied or wonderful, to be
                  sureâ€”through which he had been carried during the winter, while Lariko consumed
                  quite as much time in telling, in his simple, Indian way, the stories concerning
                  the Americans which he had heard in the Mohawk valley, and rehearsing the many
                  dangers through which <emph>he</emph> had gone, likewise. All this formed a
                  pleasurable conversational topic for both the wanderers for a long time, at length
                  they settled down upon the direct plan of operations for the succeeding
                  season.</p>
               <p>"At any rate," said Marshall, pointing anxiously with his index-finger in the
                  direction of the witch's hut, "at any rate, one thing must be done soon!"</p>
               <p>"What be that?" inquired Lariko, his little eyes looking more diminutive and
                  passive in their expression than ever.</p>
               <p>"The girl!" answered Marshall, "you haven't forgotten the girl, Lariko, so
                  soon?"</p>
               <p>"Lariko no forget! Lariko remember <emph>always!</emph>" was the Indian's
                  reply.</p>
               <p>"And I haven't forgotten the cutting I got, either, from those rebel switches,
                  last fall! I don't forget such things, Lariko! I have sworn <emph>never</emph> to
                  forget <emph>that!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Ugh!" exclaimed the Indian, producing that peculiar gutteral sound usually made
                  by those of his race.</p>
               <p>"That young Cap'n Howe mustn't think I'm goin' to let him off so easy!" continued
                  the tory. "I'm bound to rob him of his sweetheart, that he makes such a fuss over,
                  every time he comes up here from camp; and then if I can get a chance at
                     <emph>him,</emph> I shan't miss long of it! Ha! ha! ha!" laughed he,
                  fiendishly, "I've seen him before! I know just such characters, and aint to be
                  scared by 'em, nuther! He'll be up this way pretty soon, now that the spring
                  opens, and then you shall see what a fuss'll be made! He'll come up on to this
                  mountain, and he'll hunt, and hunt, and hunt round for his galâ€”but she won't be
                  here!â€”no, noâ€”he'll not find her <emph>here,</emph> I can assure him!"</p>
               <p>"Lariko creep round the hutâ€”Indian sly, like wild catâ€”sly, like pantherâ€”Lariko
                  look into hutâ€”see the fair maiden! Lariko bring back he sights to paleface
                  brother! The maiden is fairâ€”fair, like the white lily on the pondâ€”Lariko watch
                  fair maiden with both eyesâ€”creep like wild catâ€”come tell paleface brother!"</p>
               <p>"Enough, enough; the gal shall leave that but jest as soon as there comes a good
                  chance to carry her away! All I want is, to know when that cussed<pb n="74-75"
                     xml:id="VAC6939-00000038"/> old black catâ€”that I believe is only the devil
                  himself in her skinâ€”will go away! She'll be likely to go with her mistress, when
                  the old hag goes into the woods, and then I shall feel a trifle safer."</p>
               <p>This conversation between these two worthies, during which their nefarious plot
                  was principally laid for the abduction of the beautiful mountain-nymph, Mary, by
                  force, was held only the day before the transaction we are about to record. The
                  Indian's blood was well stirred by the appliances of the tory against everything,
                  and everybody, that could be an object of endearment to Captain Howe, and he was
                  fully as ready as his unnatural instigator to perform any deed that might be
                  suggested to him. Early the next morning, Lariko left the little hut, or cabin,
                  beneath the scraggy ledge, and stole like a shadow through the pathless forest in
                  the direction of the habitation of Bet Miffles, the witch. Marshall lay concealed
                  in the hut, awaiting the return of his companion.</p>
               <p>"And this young stripling of a fellow," mused he to himself, aloudâ€”"this young
                  stripling thinks he can hold me in his hands, as if I was a baby! The bold
                  fool!â€”but he doesn't know who Jim Marshall is yet! It's easy enough to cry out
                  'tory' 'tory!' to the people in the village, and it's easy enough, too, so far as
                  I know, to make 'em believe all he chooses to say against me! But he'll find that
                  talkin's <emph>one</emph> thing, and actin's quite another! He's got to find
                     <emph>that</emph> out sometime or otherâ€”and why not <emph>now</emph> jest as
                  well as at any other time? There's no tellin, nuther, how long this war's goin' to
                  last; and if I'm to do anything about him, I'd better do it now! Ah, yes! I know
                  him so well! I know all about him! He don't slip me this timeâ€”no, he don't! Then
                  how much of a profit, in the way of favor, this may be to me, after all! There is
                  no tellin', absolutely, how much it may be the means of promotin' me! Only let her
                  marry some one of them British officers, with his gold lace and silver swordâ€”and
                  what a figger she'd cut! And does anybody think Jim Marshall wouldn't be the
                  gainer by it? And he would have his revenge on his enemy, too! <emph>That's</emph>
                  the thingâ€”that's the thing! <emph>There's</emph> where I kill two fat birds with
                  one stone! Yes, there's where I do it! Let me see, if I should make known to one
                  o' them Britishers what eyes she'd got, and how much like their Queen she
                  lookedâ€”wouldn't Iâ€”<emph>wouldn't</emph> I be in the way of mendin' my shattered
                  matters a trifle? Perhap not! Oh, no, perhaps not! But, I vow, I'll secure the gal
                  first, and we'll talk about gettin' her a lover afterwards. A bird in the hand's
                  worth two in the bushâ€”true enough! true enough! For all that, though, I think I've
                  as good as got her <emph>now;</emph> I sh'd like to stay and see what the valiant
                  Cap'n will have to say, when <emph>he</emph> comes home! I guess he'll think of me
                  then! I guess he will! I love to have my friends think of meâ€”I do!"â€”and with these
                  words, he rolled over upon his temporary couch on the floor, and relapsed into a
                  train of reflection precisely similar to the above, with the exception that it was
                  silent and unspoken. Even <emph>the walls</emph> have ears, he began to fear, when
                  he found how vehement his expressions were fast getting to be.</p>
               <p>He had lain but a little while, however, upon his hard bunk, when he heard the
                  sound of coming footstepsâ€”soft, stealthy, and careful. He started upon his feet,
                  awaiting any sign that might be made him. If the person advancing was the Indian,
                  he would be sure to make known his presence by the token mutually agreed upon.
                  Placing his eye to a crevice between the logs that formed one of the walls of the
                  habitation, he cautiously surveyed the premises. Instead of their coming nearer,
                  the footsteps seemed to be retreating, or, rather, going off in an oblique
                  direction. He watched closely between the tree-boughs, whose sprays were just
                  expanding beneath the influence of the sun, and in a moment saw with surprise the
                  form of a woman. Who could she be?â€”a woman passing by there in the early
                  morning!</p>
               <p>"It's the witch! As I live, the old witch!" exclaimed he aloud, as soon as he had
                  become satisfied of the fact with close watching. "Yes, and there goes her
                  devilish black cat behind her! That's good luck for Jim Marshall! Great luck for
                     <emph>him.</emph>"</p>
               <p>He was on the point of rushing from the cabin and congratulating himself in the
                  open air, where his overjoyed spirits would be less trammelled, upon his excellent
                  fortune; but he was checked by some contrary impulse quite as sudden, and gave up
                  the project almost as soon as he had conceived it. His solitary
                  self-congratulations were not permitted to continue long, however; for, within
                  five minutes of the time when old Bet Miffies passed, the door opened and the
                  Indian walked in. One could not have detected in the simple expression of his
                  features any particular cause for joy, except he had trained himself thoroughly to
                  read just such expressions. To Marshall, the countenance of the Indian denoted
                  much elation; but he detected it only in the quicker kindling and swelling of his
                  small eyes. The muscles about the mouth were as rigid as marble.</p>
               <p>"The old witch is gone!" exclaimed Marshall, unable to contain himself longer.</p>
               <p>"How does pale face know?" asked the Indian, surprised that he should have found
                  it out.</p>
               <p>"The old black devil's with her, too!" added the tory.</p>
               <p>"Has the pale face power to see everywhere, like the Great Spirit?" asked the
                  astonished native.</p>
               <p>"No, but I generally manage to see what's goin' on about me," answered Marshall.
                  "The old-hag just went by here!"</p>
               <p>"And see the lodge?" inquired the Indian, alarmed.</p>
               <p>"No, she looked straight ahead! She knows no thin' at all of any such place as
                  this is! She saw nothin'! Don't be afraid! What news do you bring, Lariko?"</p>
               <p>"Lariko creep like the congar! Lariko steal like the breath of the gentle
                  wind!"</p>
               <p>"I know how slick you do it, old fellow!" interrupted rupted Marshall, impatient
                  to hear what he really had to tell.</p>
               <p>"Indian creep to the lodgeâ€”creep closeâ€”put his ear to crack, and listen!"</p>
               <p>"Well, what d'ye hear, Lariko?"</p>
               <p>"Let Indian tell!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes! Go ahead, old fellow! I'll listen all day to ye; only don't let's miss
                  such a good chance to get the gal!"</p>
               <p>"Lariko put his ear to crackâ€”old woman mumble, mumble, to spring-flowerâ€”fair
                  maiden keep tongue fast! She make no word! Old witch tell she be gone in the
                  forest all day, andâ€”"</p>
               <p>"Did she say all day, though?" interrupted Marshall again, "what <emph>more</emph>
                  could we ask?"</p>
               <p>"Old witch take black devil and leave the lodgeâ€”fair maiden all alone!"</p>
               <p>"Then we must go over there and do what we've got to pretty soon? There's
                     <emph>work</emph> to be done, Larikoâ€”<emph>work!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"When old witch gone, Lariko creep like wild-cat up to the window, and look on the
                  spring flower! The maiden like the morning blush on the clouds in the east!
                  Beautyâ€”beautyâ€”all beauty! Fair as the Red Man's heaven away in the south-west!
                  More beautiful than the lily cup, when it floats on the bosom of the glassy lake,
                  where the soft eyed deer come and slake their thirst! The maiden be truly Manokee!
                  Oh, the happy man that this place-faced maiden gives her heart to!"</p>
               <p>"But I know who she <emph>won't</emph> give her heart toâ€”and that is, that young
                  fool of a Cap'n Howe! I'll swear he won't git it, whether she concludes to give it
                  to him or not!"</p>
               <p>"The maiden is very fair," replied Lariko. "She is fit for the squaw of a great
                  chief! She would sit well in his wigwam, and look more fair, as she counted his
                  many scalps with her lily-white hands!"</p>
               <p>"Well," said Marshall, "we'll say no more <emph>now</emph> about her beauty; we'll
                     <emph>git</emph> her here first, and p'raps there'll be time enough to think
                  about it <emph>then.</emph> Suppose we start off for the hut now!"</p>
               <p>"Lariko readyâ€”Indian always ready!" responded his companion.</p>
               <p>The tory needed no further words of encouragement. His determination was at once
                  taken. Examining his musket, to see that his priming was in good trim, and to
                  satisfy himself more especially that there was enough of it, he started hurriedly
                  for the door. The Indian was close at bis heels.</p>
               <p>They took the most direct path to the hut of the old witch, and when at length
                  they reached the open plain that spread out before it, the tory could not avoid
                  resting a moment, and gazing far-off at the quiet little village. He thought how
                  few there were in that village street, who knew that <emph>he</emph> was so near
                  them; how lately, too, it appeared to him that he passed among them, with as
                  honest a look as any! The scene more than half enchanted him, ruffian as he had
                  grown. There was a freshness in the prospectâ€”nay, in the very air he breathedâ€”that
                  inclined him to linger longer, and yield to his reflections. But he suddenly
                  bethought himself of his businessâ€”of the purpose he had in his mindâ€”and hurried
                  on. He cared then no more for the beautiful scenery, or the bracing air, than if
                  their influences had not so suddenly refreshed him.</p>
               <p>Reaching the door of the hut, Marshall motioned the Indian to remain outside,
                  while he himself entered. Regardless of ceremony, and perhaps desirous of making
                  as sudden and deep an impression upon the fears of the young girl as possible, he
                  lifted the latch and opened wide the door. There was no one there, whom he could
                  detect. He looked steadily all about the apartmentâ€”there was no one.</p>
               <p>Just stepping over the threshold upon the oaken floor, he raised an echo that
                  appalled him. Nor did it fail to have the effect he could most have desired; for
                  the moment she heard it, Maryâ€”the beautiful grandchild of the witchâ€”opened the
                  door of her bedroom, and stood contronting the intruder. Her face at first turned
                  ashy pale; then the color rushed to it in terror; and then she grew white and
                  livid again. A single glance only at the person standing before her, sufficed to
                  satisfy her as to who he was. She had not seen him since the fiendish black cat
                  had given him such an unmerciful excoriation. She knew him now, however, well
                  enough. She knew that faceâ€”those eyesâ€”that expression, sinister, fiendish,
                  forbidding!</p>
               <p>He gazed for a moment steadily and impudently in her face. Her eyes dropped to the
                  floor, both unable and unwilling to stand so searching and severe a test. Then
                  they wandered off to another quarter of the apartmentâ€”<emph>any where,</emph> to
                  any objectâ€”so they should not meet those awful eyes of his. She bit her pallid
                  lips in confusion, praying inwardly that words might be supplied her in this
                  moment of her need.</p>
               <p>"You are all alone this mornin'," remarked the tory, stepping a pace further in
                  and allowing the door to fall to after him.</p>
               <p>The maiden looked, or nodded, an affirmative. She could not answerâ€”she <emph>dared
                     not</emph> answer with words, fearing that the very first syllable she uttered
                  might work to her greater harm in the end.</p>
               <p>"I knew that you was," said Marshall; "I saw the old hag clearing with her black
                  devil for the woods. I've been on her track this long while! I know when she's to
                  home, and when she's not to home! I have eyes, miss!"</p>
               <p>Mary certainly, would have been willing to admit that he had, and such eyes, too,
                  as she cared not to dwell long in contemplation of. But being a young girl, timid
                  as a fawn, tooâ€”she held her peace.</p>
               <p>"Now that that damned black devil and her mis, tress are gone," continued he,
                  elevating his voice a little, "I want to ask you two or three questions, my little
                  puss. Set down, if you want to, for I'm a-goin' to!" and he proceeded without
                  further ceremony to appropriate to his use the chair that stood unoccupied near
                  him. "You love that youngling of a Cap n Howe, don't you?"</p>
               <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6939-00000039"/>
               <p>"Am I bound to tell you all my thoughts?" replied she, firmly, though it was a
                  mystery to her how the words came to her lips.</p>
               <p>"Really! Quite gritty, for a mountain lass!" exclaimed the tory, his eyes
                  flashing, and his face becoming more animated in its always fierce expression.
                  "Who's been firing <emph>you</emph> up in this manner? The young Cap'n, I
                  conclude! Oh, yes! a very pretty thing, this marrying a Cap'nâ€”a rebelâ€”and a base
                  coward! a very pretty thing, indeed!'</p>
               <p>"You speak that of which you are ignorant!" exclaimed the girl, her face becoming
                  suddenly flushed with excitement. "If William Howe were <emph>here,</emph> you
                  would not <emph>dare</emph> to use such words as these! <emph>He</emph> would
                  teach you that not a drop of coward blood runs in <emph>his</emph> veins! If he is
                  a coward, he certainly does not show it by <emph>toryism</emph>â€”that meanest
                  species of cowardice!"</p>
               <p>"Bravely spoken, indeed, my little maid!" replied he, still successful in keeping
                  back the passion that boiled madly even now within him. "A very courageous maid
                  you are indeed! No wonder you aint afraid to live aloneâ€”or what's worse, with a
                  black devil and an old witchâ€”on a mountain! <emph>No wonder,</emph> I say! If they
                  could but have you in the reg'lar army, by jove!â€”what <emph>a commander</emph>
                  they'd make of ye!"</p>
               <p>The girl condescended to make no reply, such as words could have offered, to this.
                  It was astonishing, however, to see how, in a few moments, her whole nature seemed
                  to have changed. There appeared to be nothing of the girlâ€”nothing of the timid
                  maiden about her now. She had suddenly grown into the full stature and dignity of
                  womanhood Bending the full expression of her dark eyes upon him, she gave him a
                  steadfast look before which any one but a villain must have quailed. But such was
                  not its effect upon the tory. He returned it with one of his own as long as he
                  could preserve his equanimity, and then he broke out with:</p>
               <p>"You're a strange baggage, at any rate! What mean you by such looks?"</p>
               <p>"Ask your own conscience, sir, if you yet have one!" she replied.</p>
               <p>"But you are not civil! You do not treat me well! Youâ€”"</p>
               <p>"How should I, when you come here professedly to insult me!" said she.</p>
               <p>"I came to ask you a few questions," rejoined the tory, "and, by heavens!"â€”here he
                  raised his voice to a very high pitchâ€”"I will have them answered!"</p>
               <p>"Haven't I answered one already?" asked the girl.</p>
               <p>"Yes, in your way; and you have called me coward beside! What for an answer is
                  that, from a young miss, too"</p>
               <p>"I answered you as I thought you <emph>deserved</emph> to be answered," she
                  replied, mildly, but firmly.</p>
               <p>"Answer me this then; do you intend to marry that young Cap'n Howe?â€”the
                  scapegoat!"</p>
               <p>"You will sit in that chair for an answer to <emph>such</emph> a question, until
                  you grow old and turn gray!"</p>
               <p>"Do you think to marry him? Of course you do!" said he, seeing how useless such
                  forcing was on his part, and relapsing into a monologue. "I know all about your
                  plans! I know them allâ€”"</p>
               <p>"What are they?"</p>
               <p>"I've heard your valiant warrior talk; but there be others who can talk as big as
                  he! I know what his plans are; but there be others that know how to plan as deep
                  as he! You may believe me or not, as you please; you will live, however, to see
                  these things come to pass!"</p>
               <p>"I wish he were here," replied she, "to hear you talk as you do. I do not know why
                  you come and put it into <emph>my</emph> ears, when I can neither help nor hinder
                  any thing you choose to do! Why do you not talk with <emph>him?</emph> I have no
                  doubt that he would be <emph>glad</emph> to have you speak your sentiments to him
                  in the plain manner you have seen fit to speak to <emph>me!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I shall have my day of reckoning with <emph>him!</emph> Never fear you for
                  that! His time is to come! I have <emph>sworn</emph> itâ€”and what I have sworn,
                  that will I do!"</p>
               <p>"I presume he will be ready at any time to meet your vengeance," said she.</p>
               <p>"Girl!" cried the outlaw, advancing a single pace with a heavy stride,
                     "<emph>girl!</emph> this is not what I come here for, this morning!"</p>
               <p>"I care not what you came here for! Of course it was for no <emph>good</emph>
                  purpose, or you would not have watched your opportunity when I am defenceless and
                  alone!"</p>
               <p>"You must think of leaving," said he, calming his tone considerably</p>
               <p>"I wish you would leave me yourself!" said she, impetuously.</p>
               <p>"That I shall never do again, while you are in the hut of this old hell-cat!"</p>
               <p>"What!" shrieked the pallied girl, "what!"</p>
               <p>"You must go with me!" replied he, more calm than he was before.</p>
               <p>"<emph>I cannotâ€”I shall not.</emph> Indeed, I shall never leave my grandmother's
                  house with you. Begone! Away from me, I say! I cannot bear your presence!"</p>
               <p>"No, but I can yours; you may get yourself ready just as fast as you can! Haven't
                  many clothes, I reckon, livin' up here out of society so! Get yourself ready!
                  There's no black devil here now, in the shape of a cat!"</p>
               <p>"I wish there were! I really wish there were!" she cried, throwing up her hands in
                  wild astonishment.</p>
               <p>"I know you do, and I didn't mean to gratify you so much as to come when she was
                  here. I looked out for this thing! But come along; time grows short!"</p>
               <p>"I tell you, Jim Marshall," said she, standing firm and erect, and bringing down
                  her little foot with much force upon the floor, "I tell you that I shall
                     <emph>not</emph> go! I will not leave the house of my grandmother. Do you hear
                  me? Begoneâ€”begone!"</p>
               <p>The enraged tory stepped backward to the door which he opened a little way, giving
                  a low, shrill whistle as he did so. The eyes of the astonished girl were rivetted
                  to the spot, to see what could mean this significant sound. What could express her
                  surprise at beholding the lithe form of the Indian enterâ€”a sight to which her eyes
                  were unaccustomed. He stepped boldly into the room, and advanced to lay hold of
                  her. The moment she comprehended his purpose, her strength utterly failed herâ€”her
                  head swam round and round to her visionâ€”her senses left her, and she swooned away
                  upon the floor!</p>
               <p>"Jest the thing! Take hold of her, and we'll soon have her out o' the way!" said
                  the tory to his red companion, proceeding to take her up by her arms, shoulders
                  and back. The Indian bent himself over to the task, and, taking the lifeless body
                  between them, they bore it away, with no ordinary haste, and much less reference
                  to gentleness. They pursued the shortest route through the forest to the cabin
                  they had just vacated, after arriving at which place, they carried in the body and
                  deposited it upon the bunk the tory had so lately left. The Indian, barbarian
                  though he was, could not refrain from taking a long and steadfast look at her
                  countenance, which he pronounced one fit to grace the war-dance of the greatest
                  braves he ever knew. He indulged in many poetical expressions in relation to her
                  appearance, and added that he wondered none that the pale face was enraptured with
                  so much beauty in a single person! Though his encomiums were simple, they were
                  none the less truthful and worthy for that.</p>
               <p>Marshall stood over her, exerting himself as he best knew how for her recovery. It
                  was some time, however, before she returned to her senses, and then she appeared
                  bewildered and feverish. She tossed her arms about restlessly, glaring continually
                  at every part of the close and darkened cabin, and asked frantically where she
                  was, and what she was there for. Marshall at once saw that no good could come to
                  her by answering her inquiries, and suffered her to pursue them as she felt
                  inclined without interruption.</p>
               <p>"But why am I here?" she demanded, endeavoring to rise, and falling back more
                  exhausted with each effortâ€”"why am here? Where <emph>am</emph> I? Is William here?
                  Is he coming too? Oh, mercy, mercyâ€”take me from here! Let me begone! Why is that
                  monster here!" were exclamations that constantly passed her lips.</p>
               <p>"There's no need for you to call on William," said the tory, firing at the sound
                  of the word. "He'll come when he gits readyâ€”and that'll be a long while after you
                  git out o' his reach! <emph>He</emph> can't help you noneâ€”so best be as quiet as
                  you can!"</p>
               <p>With these and similar words from the lips of the monster, she grew alarmed the
                  more, and seeing that all her protestations were of no avail, the woman returned
                  to her again, and she buried her face in both hands, and shed scalding tears. The
                  tory looked on with a delight he seemed never to have known before on any
                  occasion.</p>

               <head type="sub">JOURNEYS BY NIGHTâ€”ESCAPEâ€”A WELCOME ROOF TREE.</head>
               <p>EVEN when Captain Howe returned to the village and visited, with Buff, the hut of
                  the witch, Mary was concealed still in the rude cabin where she had been forcibly
                  carried the third day before. Had the young man only suspected such a propinquity,
                  the forest would every foot of it have been beaten, but that she should have been
                  discovered by him. It was only too evident, from the abrupt exclamations in which
                  he indulged on taking his leave of the witch, that he felt satisfied that some
                  harm had befallen the girl, and that it had come from no other hands those that
                  had been raised against her before. But he could entertain no suspicions that Mary
                  was still so near her homeâ€”so near <emph>him.</emph> On that point, her present
                  locality, he was all in a state of bewilderment.</p>
               <p>The second night after her forcible abduction, although in a state of great
                  exhaustion from eating little or nothing for so long a time, the tory unfastened
                  the door of the cabin, threw in a poor suit of men's clothes, and ordered the girl
                  to disguise herself in them as soon as possible. He added nothing further, but she
                  saw already enough to assure her that he was bent upon something. Fearing to do
                  otherwise than obey, she accoutred herself as he desired very shortly, and he
                  returned before long and bade her follow him.</p>
               <p>"But whither?" she ventured to askâ€”"where are we going?"</p>
               <p>"No matter!" replied he, sharply, and in a tone most calculated to impress her
                  heart with fear; "ask no questions, and I will tell you no lies."</p>
               <p>The maiden fetched a deep groan on hearing his words, but dared say nothing in
                  reply. She stepped, obedient to his command, to the door, and looked upward
                  through the darkening trees at the sky. It was densely filled with black headed
                  clouds, driving to the northward before a fresh wind, and shadowing everything in
                  gloom. Her heart sank within her, as she contemplated the dreary prospect, and she
                  had half a mind to return to her rude couch and refuse to stir from it again But
                  just then she saw the piercing eye of the tory upon her, and heard the voice of
                  the Indian advising him to be in as great haste as possible, and she felt only
                  that she was within his power, and that he had the will to carry her wherever he
                  listed. It was, truly, a pitiable sightâ€”that fair girl, going forth in her
                  unseemly disguise on the night in question, protected (if protected at all) by a
                  nefarious, vagabond tory, and a roving, wily Indian! She crossed the threshold,
                  stepped her feet upon the ground, and she then felt that a great Futureâ€”all
                  untried, and all unseenâ€”was before her. The thoughts, and feelings, and doubts,
                  and fears, that crowded themselves so rapidly and promiscuously upon her brain,
                  were those to which she had hitherto been a stranger.</p>
               <p>With a heart heavy yet trustful, she commenced or journey. She had been threatened
                  with instant<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6939-00000040"/> death by both the Indian and
                  the tory, if she uttered a cry during its progress, or even made a sign for as
                  sistance to any whom chance might throw in their way. Feeling the weight of such
                  threats constantly pressing upon her heart, she had not courage even to <emph>hope
                     for,</emph> even had she dared so much as to <emph>plan,</emph> an escape.</p>
               <p>They journeyed on, the greater part of the time in silence, during the whole of
                  the first night, and stopped not until the gray streaks of coming morning
                  admonished her inhuman captors that their safety, while yet they were within the
                  American lines, depended entirely upon their keeping clear of discovery. For this
                  purpose, they rested with early dawn, and all prepared to take a breakfast
                  together. A bit of cold vension, and a couple of dried biscuit, were laid before
                  Mary, as her matutinal meal, and the Indian hunted about until he found a fresh
                  spring from which he brought her clear water in a drinking horn. The food was
                  anything save inviting to her in its aspect, and her natural appetite would have
                  refused to partake of a morsel of it; but the severities she had been called to
                  undergo had created so inordinate an appetite within her, that she fell to eating
                  what was set set before with a downright, hearty relish. The tory regarded this
                  evidenceâ€”as he deemed itâ€”of her gradual compliance with his wishes, with favor;
                  and he forthwith proposed to himself a thousand plans and projects for making her
                  possession feflect to his highest advantage.</p>
               <p>The Indian passed some considerable portion of the time in scouting about the
                  neighborhood. On one occasion during the day, a party of men, dressed as plain
                  farmers, yet having guns across their shoulders, passed him while he was secreted
                  among the branches of a tree above their heads, and he gladly gathered from their
                  conversation what was then going on in the American camp. He learned that General
                  Putnam was quartered farther up among the Highlands, and was at that time engaged
                  in the supervision of the works at West Pointâ€”a station of defence upon which he
                  had recently himself pitched. This was of course cheering news to the tory, for
                  the he knew that the American pickets did not now extend very far below him, and
                  he would be obliged to travel in this manner but a little way farther.</p>
               <p>The tory himself likewise took his turn at strolling about the place, and during
                  the day had pretty well concluded his arrangements in his mind in relation to the
                  route he should pursue. There was but little anxiety in his mind respecting a safe
                  arrival now within the lines below. As the American camp had been moved higher up
                  the river, the plans for preventing a free passage to doubtful and suspicious
                  characters, like himself, would not be as perfect or in as vigorous operation as
                  he had reason to remember they once were.</p>
               <p>At early nightfall, therefore, they were ready to resume their march. Marshall
                  signified his intention of moving to his fair prisoner in the same un feeling and
                  brutish manner that had hitherto characterized him. To her the intelligence was
                  particularly agreeable; for so long a rest upon only the damp ground, immediately
                  after a whole night's tedious and painful tramp, was but a sore trial to the
                  muscular powers, while her spirit was impatient to know the very worst that was
                  yet to befall her. And taking up the bundle which contained the garments of her
                  own, for which she had temporarily assumed those she wore, she put her delicate
                  feet in motion over the rough, stony, untrodden ground. At first, it was
                  excessively painful to her; for her ankles were considerably swollen with the
                  unusual journey of the night previous, and the halt they had observed through the
                  day had not had the effect to refresh her taxed and overstrained powers. But
                  still, she felt the clouds of gloomy despondency lift, in a measure from her
                  heart, while she kept in motion. Anything was preferable to sitting still in the
                  trackless Highland forests, and sadly contemplating the dismal prospect.</p>
               <p>Several times was she ordered by the hardened tory to mend her gait and increase
                  her speed, for that their time was precious to them. To these barbarous urgings
                  she offered not a syllable of protest. From what she had already seen of the
                  character of her captor, she was persuaded that no words from her lips could avert
                  or stay the doom he had determined for her. She painly saw that she was to expiate
                  the hatred her captor had, for some unknown reason, imbibed against her lover. If
                  she had a hope at this dark hour, it was based upon nothing that she promised
                  herself she could do; she looked upon no human aid for her salvation, whenever it
                  should come; the only light that gleamed across the dark future for her eyes, was
                  that which her trustful and tried spirit looked for in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Unable to reach a point as far below as he had at first thought, by the next
                  morningâ€”for their route was necessarily so devious and difficult as to baffle all
                  calculations in respect to the relation between time and space, while on footâ€”they
                  came to a second halt not long after midnight, and the tory and the Indian
                  succeeded in collecting boughs sufficient to afford quite a respectable shelter,
                  with the assistance of the favoring rocks and ledges. Not a moment was suffered to
                  elapse during which their prisoner was not closely watched and guarded, else she
                  might have dared to raise timid hopes in her mind of an escape from them. Even
                  during the still and dull hours of night, the one watched while the other slept,
                  neither feeling willing to trust themselves in to the enjoyment of that luxury
                  simultaneously with the other. But towards morning, as the hours began to wear
                  slowly and heavily away, and while the other was standing his own watch, he felt a
                  drowsiness and a torpor gradually steal over him which it seem that no human power
                  could control. It affected him strangely, drawing down the lids of his eyes as if
                  heavy weights were attached to them, and so benumbing his limbs, that he found he
                  had no use for them. This was all the consequence of fatigue and exposure; yet he
                  thought not but that he could bear all that, and still remain watchful as any. But
                  here was his mistake.</p>
               <p>In a few minutes he began to snore. Mary, who had at no time any more than
                     <emph>feigned</emph> sleep, now that she saw her most hated enemy sound in the
                  arms of a deep sleep, cautiously looked all about her and surveyed her chances for
                  an escape. She was not bound, for her captors thought she could not escape them
                  even should she attempt running. Her own bundle of clothes was at her hand. The
                  night was dark, and she lay somewhat concealed from the tory by the boughs they
                  had set up about her. It was a sudden thought to rise from that hard bed and move
                  stealthily away. As she rose to her feet, she glanced at the form of the tory. His
                  head still rested upon his chest, and she could hear the deep comings of his
                  difficult breaths. She was satisfied that he was asleep, and that now was her time
                  of salvation. She paused not to consider experiences, or to set at rest doubts.
                  Had she done so, her whole time would have been consumed. She moved at once from
                  her rude couch, and by a triflingly circutious route departed from the presence of
                  the strange beings she so much feared.</p>
               <p>Knowing nothing of the course she should take in that trackless wood, upon the
                  side of a high declivity, she happened to direct her steps southward, instead of
                  northward. She kept on her way with astonishing perseverance, ignorant herself
                  that her powers of endurance were so extensive. It was quite early morning when
                  she struck upon the road far below, out far from which she re-changed her dress,
                  taking the precaution to hide her cast-offs, lest her pursuers might stumble upon
                  them and be at least satisfied of the direction she had taken. In the dress of a
                  female she feared no interference, no insults from any one. If she continued to
                  travel in her disguise, however, it must inevitably be discovered in the
                  day-light, and the honesty of her purpose would certainly be questioned. It was,
                  therefore, the wisest and the safest course for her to do as she did. It
                  discovered the native sagacity that was in her.</p>
               <p>She had now travelled some five or six hours steadily. In that time she had made
                  considerable ground, and at about nine o'clock in the morningâ€”a clear and
                  beautiful spring morningâ€”she walked up to the little roof of Mrs. Flood, and
                  sought admission.</p>
               <p>"It's a long ways you ve come, sweet miss," said that woman, gazing at her with
                  unbounded astonishment. "I'm sure, I should know you had travelled far, from the
                  looks of your dress. But come in, and rest you! You look tired and worn! I can't
                  give you that to eat which I wish I could, but I'll go with you to a place where
                  there's enough to be had, and a welcome with it."</p>
               <p>The beautiful countenance of the girl had struck Mrs. Flood at once, and left a
                  deep impression upon her mind. She had not had an opportunity hitherto to witness
                  an example of the same distress she had once suffered herself, and now that an
                  object of similar suffering had presented itself to her, she felt all her unborn
                  sympathies quicken and her warm heart expand. She thought she loved the wanderer
                  already, for she seemed to have suffered what she had herself.</p>
               <p>"Almost any place will be welcome to me," said the maiden, with one of those sweet
                  and sincere expressions upon her countenance which came and went at times like
                  brief glimpses of sunshine through clouds.</p>
               <p>"I wish, indeed, I had a better roof to offer you," replied Mrs. Flood, looking
                  sadder than before, if possible. "There was a time"â€”here she was compelled to
                  pause a moment to suppress her rising emotionâ€”"there was a time," she continued,
                  "when I was not obliged to apologize to my friends for the humble character of my
                  roof. I have not always been just what you see me now, bless God! No, noâ€”sweet
                  miss! I was once all happy. I knew not what suffering meant, until the tempter
                  came!â€”but you do not care to hear it; <emph>nobody</emph> cares to hear it. My
                  friends are all gone now except these kind friends at the house I speak
                     of;â€”<emph>they</emph> are all the friends I have left!"</p>
               <p>"How far do they live from here?" inquired Mary, anxious to change the current of
                  a conversation she saw was productive of so much sorrow.</p>
               <p>"Oh, it's only a short distance from here!" replied she, suddenly brightening.
                  "Shall I show you the way there? Shall I go now!"</p>
               <p>Mary signified to her in her gentle manner that she should be glad to go to the
                  house as soon as she would find it convenient to accompany her.</p>
               <p>"Mercy me!" exclaimed Mrs. Flood, "it's no trouble at allâ€”no trouble for me to go
                  over there; I suppose I go there full twenty times a day, in such pleasant weather
                  as this is; besides, I've been thinking all the morning of getting over there
                  sometime before noon. I know that Miss Ellen will be so glad to see you too; you'd
                  be such a companion to her!"</p>
               <p>They were just on the point of departing, when her son came upon the threshold,
                  and, seeing the fair countenance of the girl, he exclaimedâ€”</p>
               <p>"Why, mother, here's my sisterâ€”my lost <emph>sister!</emph>â€”isn't it, mother?
                  Where could she have come from, this sweet morningâ€”out of the dew-drops, think
                  you? How thick they hang, though, on the bushes, this morning! Aint you my sister,
                  miss?"</p>
               <p>Mary strove hard to hide her blushes, but they got the mastery of her. She was
                  afraid to look the young man in the face again, for since his eyes had laid upon
                  her with so much interest, they were unaccountably changed in their
                  expression.</p>
               <p>"Come, Tim my son!" said the woman, "sit you down here, until we go to the other
                  house; we will be gone but a short timeâ€”only to see Miss Ellen, you know."</p>
               <p>"Then won't you bring my sister back again?" asked he.</p>
               <p>"If she chooses to come," replied his mother; "but I imagine she'll never want to,
                  after she sees the roof they've got up there to shelter bodies with! It's a<pb
                     n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6939-00000041"/> good home up there for anybody, miss,"
                  continued she, directing her address to Mary.</p>
               <p>Tim was persuaded to remain behind, and his parent accompanied the fair wanderer
                  over the road that conducted them to the house of Mr. Wilson. She should have gone
                  by the path through the little orchard, she said, but it was so much more dry to
                  walk in the road that early in the morning. It took them not long to reach Mr.
                  Wilson's mansion, before whose door Mrs. Flood did not stop to perform any
                  ceremonies preparatory to admission, but walked immediately in, followed by Mary.
                  The latter, however, could not be persuaded to go farther than the hall, her
                  native modesty stopping her at that point, and her eyes wandering restlessly over
                  signs of comfort, and even magnificence, such as she had never known before.</p>
               <p>In a moment Mrs. Flood came walking briskly back with a young lady. Mary saw, at a
                  glance, that she was a hunchback, though she scarce remembered the distortion when
                  her look rested on her countenanceâ€”so sweet, so placid, so heavenly, its whole
                  expression! She seemed formed only to perform the enviable office of charity.</p>
               <p>"I am a stranger here," ventured to urge Mary, "having just completed a long and
                  tedious walk. If you could afford me a shelter for a brief time, you will do me a
                  favor I shall never forget."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Flood immediately spake something to Ellen, in a low voice and a hurried
                  manner, and the latter addressed Mary in reply. She was already smitten with her
                  charms herself.</p>
               <p>"You are welcome to this roof, if you are a wanderer, or in any way a sufferer. We
                  know not what real suffering is here, and it always gives me the greatest
                  satisfaction to alleviate it when I can;" and with these words, she proceeded to
                  take off such outer garments as the stranger had worn in her travels, while the
                  face of the latter looked so much more radiant and heavenly out of her hood, that
                  she could not resist the temptation to impress upon her cheek an affectionate
                  kiss. Mary's face instantly glowed with color. It was in thing to which she was
                  wholly unused. She never knew what love wasâ€”a true, deep, abiding, sisterly
                  love.</p>
               <p>Taking her by her hand, Ellen led her visiter into the breakfast room, where the
                  table was still standing. She insisted on Mary's sitting down to table at once,
                  knowing that she must be weary and famished after the long walk she supposed she
                  had taken. With a true delicacy that was peculiarly hers, she forebore making any
                  inquiries relative to her friends, or her destination; preferring to wait until a
                  farther acquaintance should unbend the formalities that then eat, in a manner,
                  upon the mind of the girl.</p>
               <p>The breakfast was eaten with a hearty relish. Never, it seemed to Mary, had she
                  heard of such food. The rich-colored coffee was as nourishing quite as it looked.
                  The spoons were embossed, and beautifully carved, The dishes were beyond, far
                  beyond any conception she had ever had of such things, bred as she had been to the
                  woods, and unused as she totally was to the sight of such things. When at length
                  she had finished, a sense of returning vigor came over her again, and she felt
                  quite another being. Following her friendly guide, she proceeded to the parlor,
                  and there both of them sat down, side by side, upon the sofa.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilson himself was in New York. Consequently, the entire charge of his house
                  was left to his daughters. The vagrant tories that infested the "neutral ground,"
                  dared not approach his premises, for he was too well-known to them, and his
                  domains lay altogether too far below the outskirts of the British lines. The two
                  girls had not been sitting long in the parlor, the windows thrown up and the fresh
                  fragrance of expanding flowers floating like clouds of incense within the room,
                  before Miss Alice, made her appearance. Ellen was at a loss how properly to
                  introduce the stranger to her sister, but without embarrassing her so much as by
                  asking her name, she explained to Alice in what manner she had come there, and
                  what was her desire in respect to obtaining shelter and refreshment. Alice
                  appeared to be as deeply interested in her as was Ellen. She saw much to admire in
                  that beautiful faceâ€”those deep dark, expressive eyesâ€”and the arch, yet perfectly
                  innocent, look of that finely cut mouth. On the other side, Mary was quite as much
                  charmed with Alice; and between the two sisters, upon the strength only of her
                  first impression, she felt that there would be a difficulty in establishing a
                  preference.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
               <head type="sub">LIFE IN THE COTTAGEâ€”LOVE AND HOPE.</head>
               <p>MARY narrated as much of the history of the sufferings to Ellenâ€”with whom her
                  confidence seemed to have better established itself from the firstâ€”as she deemed
                  proper, and likewise all she herself knew concerning her grandmother. As there was
                  no particular name attached to the place where her hut was, of course she was
                  unable to satisfy her respecting the exact locality whence she came. In reply to
                  her repeated and anxious expressions of her desire to return to her mountain home
                  again. Ellen attempted to successfully urge the impossibility of her passing over
                  the ground between the two lines with any degree of safety, and really convinced
                  her that there could be little doubt of the war's terminating within a very brief
                  time. Whichever party was victorious, she said, neither would consent to fight
                  much longer.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Wilson returned from the city, Ellen used all the powers of her
                  persuasion with him to allow Mary to remain where she was during the summer, for,
                  that there could be nothing but danger for her while the war continued, and
                  furthermore, she had begun already to be such a companion for her as she had long
                  desired Mr. Wilson was much too indulgent a parent with his children to refuse to
                  accede to so slight a request; and with a kiss on each cheek of his sweet child,
                  while he affectionately held both her hands in his own, he bade her believe that
                  so fair a stranger was sent her for some particu la good. Mr. Wilson was a
                  believer, somewhat, in special providences; besides, he was a man of the
                     <unclear>kindest</unclear> and most tender feelings by nature, and could not
                  have seen even an enemy suffer for the want of those necessaries, or attentions,
                  which he could as well as not supply.</p>
               <p>It was far into summer, and Mary was still the guest of the house of the Wilsons.
                  Every day since her arrival there, had she grown more deeply attached to them all.
                  Alice she could not help secretly <emph>admiring;</emph> she had such stately and
                  elegant manners; her words were always so full of music to her ears; her smiles
                  were always so wreathed with roses. But it was Ellen which she had learned to
                     <emph>love</emph> Ellen displayed none of that elegance that belonged more
                  naturally to her sister. Her misfortune had the effect to drive the pride out from
                  her heart. To be sure, she was exceedingly sensitive regarding every remark, and
                  even every look, that seemed to reflect upon the peculiarity of her form, but
                  aside from this quite common idiosyncracy with persons in her condition, her heart
                  was as soft as the summer breeze that swam through the jessamines into their
                  parlor window.</p>
               <p>The intimacy between the two girls grew more marked every day. Ellen loved a
                  ramble in the woods and among the ledges back of their residence, and what
                  companion better schooled for entering into all new plans, and interests, and
                  feelings, than was Mary! She had been <emph>living</emph> in the woods. Her
                  breaths had chiefly been drawn upon the mountain side, where extended views and
                  bracing air combined to impart to her soul a freshness and vigor it never could
                  have obtained elsewhere. By Alice, this intimacy between the girls was regarded
                  with no sort of disfavor, for she was too sensible to allow the natural
                  preferences of any one for another to under her happiness. On the contrary, she
                  seemed to take a pleasure herself in recognising such a fact, and that only served
                  to endear her still the more to the lovely Mary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilson continued to have the gentlemen of the British army visit his dwelling
                  during the summer, to all of whom the presence of three such companions as were
                  the three girls under his roof, afforded no unpleasant variation to the routine of
                  their duties in the city. These gentlemen ever preferred the charms of the
                  countryâ€”when, too, such multiplied attractions were about themâ€”to the monotonous
                  round of their duty below, and when they left to return thither, it was always
                  with vain regrets at the rapid passing of time, and many self-extorted promises to
                  visit the lovely spot again. Never, in fact, looked Mr. Wilson's place so inviting
                  as it did in mid-summer. The house was deeply shaded with trees, and bushes, and
                  climbing vines, The Piazza itself was a harmonious bower, all entwined, too, with
                  the glossiest and the darkest leaves. There was an enticing quiet within the depth
                  of their spacious parlor, with the high windows raised, and the inner blinds
                  thrown back. At evening, especially, was this suggestive of quiet and heavenly
                  thoughts to such hearts as <emph>ever</emph> entertained themâ€”though they came as
                  angels, unawares, The low hum of voices, the drowsy chirp of the cricket in the
                  meadow, the melancholy wailing of the whip-poor willâ€”all these subdued the
                  thoughts, and set them in a sweetly saddened flow.</p>
               <p>Ellen and Mary were sitting down together on a gray rock in the grove behind the
                  house, one day, conversing in their familiar way respecting the war and its
                  multitude of consequences, near and remote, when the conversation, by some very
                  natural, but unforseen, remark, turned upon the subject of love. Ellen
                  acknowledged, in her guileless way, that she had ever craved the undivided
                  sympathies of some one heart, and now she was happy in saying that she believed
                  that heart had been found by her at last. Then she turned to Mary and assured her
                  by the most endearing words that she only meant <emph>herself</emph> by her
                  allusion, while the blushing girl acknowledged the compliment only by silence.</p>
               <p>"I have long known my misfortune," continued the hunchback, "and sometimes I have
                  been made to keenly suffer from it. Oh, there is no anguishâ€”there <emph>can</emph>
                  be no anguish, like that of a slighted, or a bruised heart! I have seen persons
                  turn from me to a contemplation of my sister, with feelings that I could not
                  control, and such as I never thought I had; and in my innermost heart. Mary, I
                  have prayed God that I might be blind to such things!â€”that my misfortune might
                  never be the cause to me of so much misery!"</p>
               <p>"It ought not to be," answered Mary, brushing back the straggling locks of her
                  companion from her pale and ample forehead, while she imprinted an affectionate
                  kiss upon the cheek next her; "it ought not to be so! Your misfortuneâ€”if so you
                  think itâ€”only makes you the more dear to me you are a different beingâ€”your heart
                  is more susceptible to tender influencesâ€”than if you had no check to your pride.
                  It must be so with every one that is as first gifted with a warm heart."</p>
               <p>"Your love, Mary, compensates for much that I might otherwise be unhappy, nay,
                  miserable, about. I feel, since, you have come here, directed by the providence
                  that brought you here in safetyâ€”I feel as if my heart had been doubled already. It
                  is not the same heart it was before you came. It seems as if there were a response
                  to all its beatings!"</p>
               <p>"You certainly praise me much more than I deserve," replied Mary, blushing, and
                  taking one of Ellen's taper hands within her own. "I shall always think that it
                  was a good spirit that brought me here to you; what should I ever have known of
                  such a heart as yours, if the most cruel accidentsâ€”cruel in themselves, but happy
                  in their resultsâ€”had not brought me so directly in your way? But I am too grateful
                  for the kindness you have so steadily shown me since I came here, to think that I
                  could have done any less than love you all for it."</p>
               <p>"I would not have you place your regard for me on<pb n="82-83"
                     xml:id="VAC6939-00000042"/>
                  <emph>that</emph> ground," said Ellen; "I am always ready to do what kindness lies
                  in my power, I hope; andâ€”"</p>
               <p>"I do not altogether; indeed, I do not, Ellen," interrupted Mary, fearing that she
                  had been misunderstood.</p>
               <p>"I love you, Mary," continued Ellen, "for what you <emph>are.</emph> I am frank to
                  tell you that I loved you as soon as you came into our house with Mrs. Flood. I
                  knew what your heart must be, from only looking in your face. That decided the
                  matter in my mind at once. I had seen never any one before, either, to whom I felt
                  that I could tell all my thoughts, as I can to you; no one who seemed to listen so
                  attentively, or to sympathise so deeply, or to give up her own heart in return for
                  mine so immediately. This is why I loved you, Mary, and the <emph>only</emph>
                  reason."</p>
               <p>"I most certainly do love you," replied Mary, "as I never lovedâ€”" she was going to
                  say, "any one else;" but the words were cut off short at that point.</p>
               <p>"I know that I am selfish, Maryâ€”all selfish, in trying to exact so much of you,"
                  said Ellen. "I know that I do a wrong. I ought not to expect so muchâ€”I, a poor
                  diminutive cripple. But I cannot help it. Mary! I cannot help it, Mary, or I
                  would! You love another more? Tell me if you do not!"</p>
               <p>Mary could not reply to the question, but sat gazing upon the ground in evident
                  confusion.</p>
               <p>"Does my heart deceive me? <emph>Can</emph> I be deceived!" exclaimed Ellen, in an
                  outburst of grief. "I <emph>knew</emph> that I asked too muchâ€”I, a poor cripple!
                  Who <emph>ought</emph> to care for me? Who <emph>will</emph> ever love me as my
                  own heart burns to be loved?"</p>
               <p>"My dear Ellen," said Mary, soothingly, "I <emph>do</emph> love you! I have always
                  loved you! There is not a single thought of yours, that is not quite as dear to me
                  as to yourself! <emph>Do</emph> not think that I shall ever cease to love you,
                  Ellen!"</p>
               <p>"No, no, no! but you cannot love <emph>me</emph> as I would love
                  <emph>you</emph>â€”wholly, deeply, without hesitation! I am selfish! I ask too much!
                  I do not think that there are many waiting, to gain but a place in a corner of
                     <emph>your</emph> heart, while <emph>my</emph> misfortune onlyâ€”"</p>
               <p>The hunchback was here so overcome by the sudden flow of her feelings, that she
                  clapped her hands suddenly before her face and buried it in the lap of her
                  astonished companion. Mary at once lifted her up gently and affectionately in her
                  arms, and, kissing her pale forehead many times, assured her that she did her
                  great injustice in thinking thus of her; that she ever had loved her most
                  devotedly, and ever should continue to: and that she should be most happy herself,
                  if she thought she could ever possess a heart so good, so kind, so full of love as
                  her own. With these and similar expressions she endeavored to soothe her troubled
                  spirit, and although she found the waters of her soul deeply stirred, yet she was
                  not altogether unsuccessful in her endeavor.</p>
               <p>Ellen at length raised her drooping head, and, trying as hard as she could to
                  smile through her tears, humbly craved her dear friend's forgiveness for the
                  selfishness she had displayed. She still kept alluding, however, to the fact that
                  she now believed no heart would ever be wholly her own; that she was destined to
                  go through the world with no sympathies <unclear/> linked in with hers. It made
                  Mary <unclear>exceeding</unclear> unhappy, because it was a grief she could not
                  heal.</p>
               <p>"I will confess to you, Ellen," said she, "that love another beside youâ€”"</p>
               <p>"I knew it! I knew it!" interrupted Ellen.</p>
               <p>"He is not near us now; he is in the army."</p>
               <p>"In the army! In the regular army?" exclaimed Ellen, her face seeming to brighten
                  a few shades.</p>
               <p>"No," the beautiful Mary was obliged to replyâ€”and the color mounted to her cheeks
                  and forehead as she did soâ€”"he belongs to theâ€”to theâ€”"</p>
               <p>"<emph>The rebels?</emph>" inquired Ellen, with a look more of surprise than of
                  inquiry simply.</p>
               <p>"No, not the rebelsâ€”they are notâ€”"</p>
               <p>"But what then?" interrupted the impatient girl.</p>
               <p>"To the continental army," answered Mary, feeling a load off her heart.</p>
               <p>"But father says they are all <emph>rebels,</emph>" remarked Ellen. "He says they
                  were a band of them that surrounded our house one night, and carried off several
                  British officers who happened to be here."</p>
               <p>"I cannot help that," said Mary; "I have never thought <emph>William</emph> a
                  rebelâ€”I always thought him a <emph>patriot.</emph> He loves that land that gave
                  him birth, and he says that he fights for its freedom!" and here the advocate-girl
                  dropped her eyes to the ground, ceased her conversation, and fell to deep
                  musing.</p>
               <p>"I thought that such a generous heart as yours could not go long unloved," said
                  Ellen. "I knew that you must at <emph>some</emph> time have one on whom you could
                  lean for sympathy. I knew it could not always be so. I knew, that I could not
                  claim <emph>all;</emph> that it was too selfish in me! But I love you none the
                  less, Mary, for this discoveryâ€”not a whit the less."</p>
               <p>"I should hope not," replied Mary. "I am our that my regard for another, like the
                  one now absent from me, can never in the least diminish that I entertain for you.
                  I shall ever love you, Ellen, I shall never cease to do so!"</p>
               <p>The girls seemed the better to understand themselves. So sincere, so strong, so
                  direct had been the affection which Ellen had suffered to grow up in her heart for
                  her stranger companionâ€”in such a little time, tooâ€”that she had grown to the idea
                  that Mary on her part could reciprocate the feeling in the same degree. But the
                  heart of the latter had been schooled differently. It had never suffered from that
                  leprous disease that had already shrivelled and weakened whatever of Ellen's it
                  had touched. It was still free, clear and healthy.</p>
               <p>Mary had had her feelings born into a world of which her pitiful companion had
                  never heard even the name. A thousand strings were drawn across the heart of the
                  former, each one giving out the sweetest music to the slightest breath, that the
                  latter knew not the existence of. True, the fibres of her affection were
                  exceedingly fine, and it took but a single sweep to set them all in vibration; but
                  that motion of them gave not out such harmony as did that of the heart of Mary.
                  She dwelt in a worldâ€”all in the future, to be sureâ€”in which she delighted to gaze
                  upon the pictures her own imagination had hung about her, and wherein she loved to
                  dwell at times entirely alone. At such times solitude was her best friend. She
                  eschewed the society even of her most intimate companionâ€”Ellen. She took solitary
                  walks in the woods; gave herself up to long reveries; often discovered an
                  otherwise inexcusable absent-mindedness; and at times was exceedingly downcast and
                  saddened. Through the causes of all this Ellen was unable to penetrate; and the
                  thought gave her great unhappiness. She began to half fear that Mary's heart had
                  been in a degree changed towards her; but the moment she began to think of
                  proposing a question in relation to it to Mary, the latter addressed her in the
                  same endearing manner as she ever had, and exhibited to her the same affection she
                  had ever entertained. Ellen, to say the least, was perplexed; but it could not
                  have been the fault of Mary. It was surely her own, if indeed there were a fault
                  about it.</p>
               <p>The summer wore away, calmly and pleasantly. They heard but little of the
                  skirmishing that had heretofore been carried on upon the 'neutral ground,' Mr.
                  Wilson holding himself as much aloof from all interference in the quarrels as
                  possible. Though thoroughly loyalâ€”as it was in that day calledâ€”to his king, he was
                  content to give his opinions only a peaceable expression, not desiring to interest
                  himself personally in any of the conflicts in which the two great parties
                  indulged. His was a desire for peace, under <emph>some</emph> conditions; he did
                  not care so much what they were, so that a stable peace could be effected. He
                  never indulged in strong or bitter expressions towards the American party, except
                  in the bosom of his own family; and there he had no fears that his very excusable
                  excesses would ever be betrayed to his disadvantage.</p>
               <p>It was a delightful summer for Mary, and quite as much so for Ellen. Mary never
                  before knew what life could really be made. Her ideas respecting happiness had
                  been early he aged in by her grandmother, and she thought there was no worldâ€”or at
                  least a very trifling worldâ€”beyond the precincts of the old cave on the mountain.
                  As it was, what Mary had become acquainted with was a very, very trifle in itself,
                  but it was a great deal to her. She had had her heart expanded under its
                  influences. New thoughts, new hopes, new feelings, new desires, had severally
                  breded and already begun to expand into a healthy bloom. There were tintsâ€”some of
                  them gorgeous tintsâ€”about her horizon on every side. She did not forget her
                  grandmother. She did not suffer her attachments of earlier days to pass out of her
                  mind. She by no means refused to remember the many claims that that aged relative
                  had upon her affection. But still she cherished a hope. It was a hope that kept
                  itself alive. Once rooted, once fairly in the way of growing, nothing could check
                  its health or curtail its existence.</p>
               <p>Ellen saw the change that had sprung up in the heart of her companion; but though
                  she could not altogether subdue that feeling of selfishness respecting her
                  affections, which was in truth only a part of her natureâ€”partially deformed, like
                  her body, as it wasâ€”yet she tried to love Mary all the more for her candid and
                  sincere feelings. She knew that this trial was the schooling through which her
                  heart must be made to pass, and she struggled, and kept struggling on, until at
                  length she achieved the victory for which she had so long labored and undoubtedly
                  prayed. And after that, it gave her the most unalloyed pleasure to sit and
                  converse with Mary upon the very topic that had once only been the cause of her
                  undivided miseryâ€”so great is the change which a thorough, patient prayerful
                  discipline can effect! Mary now seemed more dear to her than ever. Her own
                  selfishness had stood in the way hitherto of her loving her as she should; now
                  that was removed, and they were more inseparable friends than ever.</p>

               <p>It was already late in the fall of the year 1778â€”that bloody year of the whole
                  Revolutionary years, when the white settlers were slain without mercy by the cruel
                  savages, and the more cruel Britons. The division of the army under the immediate
                  command of General Putnam, went into winter quarters at that time at Reading, a
                  town in western Connecticut, and but a few miles north-east from Ridgefield. In
                  that division were included General Poor's brigade of New Hampshire militia, two
                  brigades of Connecticut militia, Hazen's infantry corps, and a corps of cavalry
                  under Shelden. This post was more particularly pitched upon for the purpose of
                  covering the country from the British lines in New York, east-ward along the
                  sound. It wasâ€”and still isâ€”a charming New England village; its houses much
                  scattered, and its chief street beautifully shaded with elms and maples.</p>
               <p>On the road leading from Norwalk to Danbury, and at the distance of about three
                  miles from the old Congregational Church in the village, General Putnam made his
                  headquarters. The house was one peculiar to those times, having a short and
                  precipitous roof in the front, and an exceedingly gradual and extended one in the
                  rear. There was little in its vicinity to attract the eye of the seeker after
                  pleasant scenery, yet it no less answered the purpose to which it was put, in
                  quartering the person of that sturdy and impetuous defender of American rights and
                  American libertyâ€”Israel Putnam.</p>
               <p>His men had for some time been in a state of discontent on account of their bad
                  food and scanty clothing, as well as the scantiness of their pay; for, being paid
                  in continental money, its constant depreciation was a source of vexatious loss to
                  them. Their murmurs had reached the ears of their General in different ways, at
                  different times; yet he saw himself unable, either by personal exertion or pecu<pb
                     n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6939-00000043"/> niary ability, to allay the causes of
                  their dissatisfaction. It galled the old man's spirit sorely, to see such brave
                  and devoted patriots absolutely <emph>cheated</emph> out of the small pittance
                  they had so richly earned by their efforts for their country, and to know that
                  there was no possibility for him to prevent it, nor even any power in his hands to
                  promise them better times. The ferment at times reached an alarming height, and
                  every day only served to augment it. Unlike most disorders, it could not be healed
                  by the slow process of <emph>time.</emph> On the contrary, it only grew worse for
                  being left with such a remedy.</p>
               <p>General Putnam was sitting in his chamber, one morning, engaged in reading over
                  some dispatches that had just reached him from the commander. The morning was cold
                  and frosty, and the ice that had formed on the window-panes had not yet begun to
                  acknowledge the influence either of the fire from within or the sun from without.
                  The General sat at a plain and small round table before the little fire, shivering
                  half the time, and reading the other half. The purport of the dispatches was
                  nothing of more than the most common interest, they relating chiefly to the
                  disposition of general affairs for the winter that was then upon them.</p>
               <p>He had finished his reading and laid his dispatches down upon the table beside
                  him. Giving his elbow chair another hitch towards the fire, he kicked back the
                  forestick with his foot and drove a shoal of sparks up the chimney. Settled more
                  deeply and comfortably in his chair after this manÅ“uvre, he began a few moments'
                  cogitation upon the state of affairs around him.</p>
               <p>Nothing occurred to interrupt the even flow of his reflections, until he suddenly
                  heard heavy footsteps on the stairs, and a moment after a hearty rap upon his own
                  door. Giving the comer, whoever he might be, the usual summons, the door opened,
                  and a voice cried out:</p>
               <p>"My dear General! My dear General!"</p>
               <p>The General hastily wheeled in his chair to see who could be the author of such an
                  exclamation, as well as to read its pregnant meaning, and beheld the long, lathe
                  form of his faithful friendâ€”Verd-Antique. Instantly he replied to this, his
                  unusual form of salutation:</p>
               <p>"John Horton! What is the matter? What news do you bring!"</p>
               <p>"Bad! bad, every way, General!" was his reply.</p>
               <p>The General was well enough acquainted with his old friend's various peculiarities
                  to know at a glance that the news he had brought could be of no ordinary
                  characterâ€”whether it were good or bad; and rising without further ceremony to his
                  feet, he turned round and advanced quite into the middle of the room before he
                  stopped. Then he demanded:</p>
               <p>"Tell me what it is, John! Tell me at once! <emph>What</emph> news do you bring?
                  Where comes it from?"</p>
               <p>"From the camp only,' replied Verd-Antique, trying to keep himself calm, and
                  allowing his General to get excited.</p>
               <p>"What's there?" demanded Putnam.</p>
               <p>"A mutiny, General a reg'lar, downright mutiny! All the Connecticut troops are
                  under arms, and are goin' to march jest as fast as their legs 'll carry 'em to the
                  legislatur' at Hartford! They swear they'll have their pay-money, and somethin'
                  extra for clothes, too! There's no stoppin' 'em, Gen'ral; they're sworn to go
                  through to Har'ford! The officers are at their head, and they 'll be under march
                  now, before anything can save 'em! Oh! my God! Is this what our liberty's got to
                  come down to, arter all! <emph>Have</emph> we got to give up the whole business
                  now?"</p>
               <p>"No, no!" shouted General Putnam, a firm and vigorous purpose suddenly seizing his
                  soul; "they'll <emph>not</emph> go to Hartford, if I can get to them before they
                  start!"</p>
               <p>Saying this, he rushed to the head of the stairway and called to his servantâ€”Dick
                  Fortuneâ€”and ordered him to have his horse at the door in the half of a minute's
                  time. The negro hurried away to obey the order of his master, and the latter
                  returned at a rapid pace across the entry to his room.</p>
               <p>"How <emph>can</emph> you think to stop 'em, Gen'ral?" inquired the deeply anxious
                  John Horton</p>
               <p>"I shall <emph>try</emph> it, at any rate," replied he, "and I know but little of
                  the real character of my men, if they will not allow themselves to be influenced
                  by me a little in this matter!"</p>
               <p>"I hope you mayâ€”in God's name, I hope you may, Gen'ral! 'Twill be too bad to fling
                  all away <emph>now!</emph>" said John Horton, while he left the room, in which his
                  brave commander was hurrying on the necessary apparel for a ride out on such a
                  morning.</p>
               <p>The General reached the door before his negro Dick had brought the horse round
                  from the barn, and his impatience would not allow him to wait longer. Hastening to
                  the rear of the house, he met the negro, and mounted his horse as soon as he could
                  grapple the bridle reins in his hand. Then driving his spurs into the spirited
                  animal, he rushed over the road in the direction where his troops lay quartered,
                  at the top of his beast's speed. When he arrived on the ground, his horse was
                  exceedingly warm, although the distance ridden was but about three miles. The
                  second brigade of the Connecticut troops were all under arms, and drawn up in
                  marching order! The appearance of the lines at once smote General Putnam's heart,
                  for he was convinced by the very best of proofâ€”his own eyesâ€”that the grievances of
                  which they complained needed greatly to be redressed. Still, the manner proposed
                  was not the one in which it could be best done.</p>
               <p>Riding up at once at full speed to the head of the brigade, he settled himself
                  firmly in his saddle and cried out in his honest, and impulsive manner:</p>
               <p>"My brave lads! where are you going? Do you intend to desert your officers, and
                  invite the enemy to follow you into the country? Whose cause have you been
                  fighting and suffering so long in? Is it not <emph>your own?</emph> Have you no
                  propertyâ€”no parentsâ€”wivesâ€”or children? You have behaved like <emph>men,</emph> so
                  far All the world is full of your praise, and posterity will stand astonished at
                  your deeds; but not if you spoil all at last! Don't you consider how much
                     <emph>the country</emph> is distressed by the war, and that your
                     <emph>officers</emph> have not been better paid than <emph>yourselves?</emph>
                  But we all expect better times, and that the country will do us ample justice! Let
                  us all stand by one another, then, and fight it out like brave soldiers! Think
                  what a shame it would be for <emph>Connecticut</emph> men to run away from their
                     officers!"<ref rend="super" target="#note_015" xml:id="return_015">*</ref>

                     careful tradition has been able to preserve them.</p>
               </note>
               <p>The electric words had hardly passed the lips of their beloved General, when all
                  the discontented regiments set up a shout of approbation that made the welkin
                  ring. Their General then rode slowly along the line; the drums began their steady
                  rolling; the soldiers all presented their arms; and Old Put by his good natured
                  countenance assured them of the grateful feelings towards them, that then welled
                  up in his heart.</p>
               <p>As soon as he had reviewed the entire line, he called out to the brigade-major to
                  order the troops to shoulder their muskets.</p>
               <p>"Shoulder arms!" rang along the line from the lips of that officer.</p>
               <p>In an instant, every gun was at its owner's shoulder.</p>
               <p>"March!" ordered the officer.</p>
               <p>And the steady tramp of human feetâ€”none too well covered from the season, to be
                  sureâ€”began to sound all along the line.</p>
               <p>The major marched them all away to their regimental parades, where he ordered them
                  to lodge their arms; which order was obeyed with the same willingness and alacrity
                  that ever before and since characterized the conduct of the troops of
                  Connecticutâ€”herself a noble sister of the self-sacrificing thirteen of our
                  revolutionary times.</p>
               <p>The arrest of one soldier, who had been most active in exciting the
                  insubordination, and who still showed symptoms of a mutinous spirit, was obliged
                  to be effected, for the safety of the plan thus far successful. He was confined in
                  the quarter-guard. During the night he attempted to make his escape from the place
                  of his confinement, and was shot dead in his tracks by a sentinel</p>
               <p>The sentinel was himself one of the most active in the insubordination of the day
                  previous.</p>
               <p>It is for the readers of this day, and for our posterity to say, whether Israel
                  Putnam's course with his dissatisfied troops was not fully as considerate, while
                  it proved far more effectual, than that pursued toward the disaffected
                  Pennsylvania troops, two winters later.</p>

               <head type="sub">OLD PUT'S RIDE AT HORSENECK HILL.</head>
               <p>It was February in the new yearâ€”1779. General Putnam had left his quarters at
                  Reading, and with but a handful of men was visiting his various outposts. About
                  the 25th of the month, he was advanced as far as West Greenwich, and was stopping
                  at the house of General Ebenezer Mead. On the morning of the 25th, quite early in
                  the morning, too, the General stood before his glass, occupied in shaving. While
                  in this position, he saw strange reflections in the mirror, and looked closer to
                  detect what they were. On the instant he was persuaded that they were human
                  figures, habited in those 'red-coats' every American soldier so much hated! They
                  were marching rapidly up the road from the west.</p>
               <p>Immediately he threw down his razor upon the dressing table, wiped off the soap
                  that yet remained upon his face with the back of his hand, hastily buckled his
                  sword around his waist, and rushed for the stable.<ref rend="super"
                     target="#note_016" xml:id="return_016">*</ref>
                   Mounting his horse, he rode round the quarters of his few men, calling out
                   in his stentorian tones.</p>
               <note place="foot" xml:id="note_016">
                  
                  <p><ref target="#return_016">*</ref>A well authenticated fact.</p>
               </note>
               <p>"To your arms, my lads! To your arms! The infernal red coats are coming! To your
                  arms! To your arms!"</p>
               <p>The men hurried out and soon satisfied themselves of the ground of the sudden
                  alarm. Nearly a thousand and a half British regulars and Hessian troops were
                  advancing along the road. With his baker's dozen men, what could Putnam do to
                  obstruct their passage? He knew of but one thing that he was certain he could
                  doâ€”he could <emph>try!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>It appeared that Governor Tryonâ€”the same who had already laid waste many of the
                  fair places of Connecticutâ€”had (with this force) left the British lines near
                  Kings-Bridge the night before, intending to surprise the troops and destroy the
                  salt-works at Horse-neck landingâ€”a part of Greenwich. The enemy were discovered at
                  New Rochelle in the night, by Capt. Watson, who had been previously sent out with
                  a body of thirty men to scout the country near the enemy's lines. By daylight the
                  British had reached Rye Neck, and at that place a skirmish followed between their
                  advanced guard and the party under Capt. Watson. The latter were driven back to
                  Sawpitsâ€”a place on the Byram River, that divides Westchester county, at that part
                  of it, from Connecticutâ€”and thence to Horseneck, closely pursued by the enemy.</p>
               <p>As soon as General Putnam had advices from these scouts in relation to what was
                  going on, he formed his men as best he could upon the brow of the hill near the
                  spot where stood the old congregational church, and where the present church
                  stands likewise. Two old iron field pieces were planted on the brow of the hill,
                  and the soldiers all stood awaiting the approach of the enemy.</p>
               <p>In solid column they marched slowly on up the hill. Old Put was all the while
                  encouraging his menâ€”of whom, by the by, he had not more than one hundred and
                  fiftyâ€”and ordering them to hold their fire until the enemy were close upon them.
                  Onward came the British and Hessian troops, their uniforms brilliant, their
                  bayonets glistening in the morning light, and their tread as steady and firm as
                  that of<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6939-00000044"/> veterans. They did not discharge
                  their pieces, but determined to drive back the Americans in another way, if they
                  could not outflank them and gain their rear. To secure the latter object,
                  detachments broke off from the main column, as soon as they had come within musket
                  shot of the enemy, while the dragoons, supported by a large body of infantry, made
                  ready to charge them in front. Putnam ordered the men to fire the cannon and their
                  muskets; but the effect of such discharges was trifling, and resulted none the
                  more in checking the enemy's steady approach. In the rear of the detachment of
                  Americans was a defile; and the British commander immediately saw that if he could
                  turn the American flanks and gain their rear, the whole body of the latter must
                  inevitably become his prisoners.</p>
               <p>General Putnam, however, understood at a glance what they wanted. He hardly
                  expected to hold an enemy so greatly outnumbering his own men in check with a
                  couple of iron field pieces, without even horses or drag-ropes, but it was a
                     <emph>principle</emph> of his always to 'show fight' when such an exhibition
                  could be supposed to create an impression. He had accordingly set men to watch the
                  movements of the enemy, so that when his position became hazarded by an attempt on
                  their part to gain his rear, he should have full warning of it</p>
               <p>The old field pieces were loaded and fired by his brave little band some two or
                  three times, and as many volleys of musketry were discharged at the enemy. Putnam
                  saw, however, that no impression was made upon them, and while yet in doubt as to
                  what might best be done next, the parties stationed on the American flanks came
                  in, saying that the British were running at the top of their speed to gain their
                  rear.</p>
               <p>"Give them what you've got!" shouted the General to his men. "They're coming!
                  They're on us! Every man take care of himself! Take to that swamp yonder!"</p>
               <p>No sooner had he uttered these words than the enemy's dragoons charged up the brow
                  of the hill at the top of their speed. They were close upon the General's horse,
                  and he yet remained to see his men safe.</p>
               <p>"Seize him! Shoot him! Bring down his horse!" shouted the foremost of the
                  dragoons, seeing who their mounted enemy was, and ambitious to earn the praise of
                  capturing so brave a man.</p>
               <p>Old Put drove his spurs into the flanks of his horse, and the animal set off at
                  his utmost speed. The General looked over his shoulderâ€”his mad pursuers were just
                  behind him. Again the spurs went into his horse, and the animal bounded forward. A
                  moment after, Putnam looked over his shoulder again. He had gained on the
                  dragoons. They were farther behind him. Determined to make the most of his
                  advantage, he again drove in the rowels, and the animal broke into a dead and
                  almost uncontrollable run.</p>
               <p>The soldiers of Putnam had hastily left their cannon at the last moment, and fled
                  to the adjoining swamps, each man taking care only of himself. They knew the
                  peculiar security of their places of refuge, and were satisfied that the enemy
                  would not attempt to gain access there. Nor did they pursue them farther. Seeing
                  how useless it all was, they halted on the eminence, while only the dragoons kept
                  on their pursuitâ€”the pursuit of that terror to the British army in and around New
                  York, Old Put.</p>
               <p>The General rode on to the northward, whither a road would round the brow of the
                  hill on the route to Stamfordâ€”a town still farther east than Greenwich. It was his
                  intention to follow this road and so effect his escape by hard riding alone. But
                  just at the time when he glanced back over his shoulder again, he heard the shouts
                  of the pursuing horsemen, encouraging each other and hallooing to one another to
                  stop that runaway. He could see, too, that they were in a fair way to stop him,
                  for already they began rapidly to gain on him again! His spirit would never allow
                  him to be taken a prisonerâ€”he was above that, while he had life to fight, or a
                  body to fall!</p>
               <p>Already they had driven him to the brow of the precipice. They were gaining on
                  himâ€”they would soon overtake him. On the brow of that precipice the road took a
                  turn and made a broad sweep to the northward, and so went entirely round the hill.
                  If he followed the road, he was gone. He knew the mettle of his horse, but
                  unfortunately could not tell of what material those of the enemy were composed.
                  The precipice was before him, and be could see the road in a straight line beyond.
                  Should he plunge down the precipice, and risk the chances of his neck? or rather
                  follow the winding of the road and be carried back to Tryon a prisoner?</p>
               <p>The thought of such a disgrace as the latter supposition seemed to include, at
                  once determined him. With Putnam, it was one and the same thing, to think and to
                  act. The latter was never known to proceed the former, but it generally followed
                  as closely upon its heels as possible. Never stopping to rein in his horse in the
                  least, but rather urging him onward by voice and spurs, the bold General plunged
                  headlong down the precipice just as the dragoons were on its brow, and within
                  swords length of him.</p>
               <p>"Good God!' shouted one, drawing up his horse so sudenly that he fell back upon
                  his haunches.</p>
               <p>"Fire! fire at him!" halloed others, unwilling that such a man should escape
                  either dead or alive from them.</p>
               <p>"Rush around by the road and head him off Bring him back a prisoner!" cried out
                  others, while a few followed the road with all the celerity there was in their
                  horses heels, intent on cutting off the bold fugitive's retreat.</p>
               <p>"Fire! fire!" again shouted one on the brow of the hill.</p>
               <p>They drew their pistols from their bolsters and discharged them at the old General
                  as he went down the steep. One of them whizzed unpleasantly near his ear, while
                  one passed directly through his military beaver! He could hear them striking
                  against the ledges and broken rocks about him, as he sped down at this break-neck
                  speed, and the sound to his ears was as the rattling of hail.</p>
               <p>Down this precipituous declivity were laid from seventy-five to one hundred rude
                  stone steps. They were calculated for the accomodoation of foot passengers, who
                  preferred, in pleasant weather to go up the steps, to going the greater distance
                  round by the road; and were chiefly used by them in going to and from the old
                  Episcopal Church, that then stood near the top of the flight, upon the hill. It
                  was down this long flight of steps, that the General spurred his horse!</p>
               <p>Though he went at such speed down a declivity so threatening, yet he gained the
                  road at the bottom in perfect safety; and, turning himself coolly round, he
                  wintessed his astonished enemies upon the edge of the precipice, and looking
                  speechlessly for a few moments upon the man who had dared so fearful an exploit.
                  They had not the courage to follow him down <emph>that</emph> course. They halted,
                  after discharging their pistols, and lost themselves in wonder.</p>
               <p>"What a fearless devil!" exclaimed one, his words just coming to him.</p>
               <p>"He's proof against all kinds of accident," remarked another. "There's no such
                  thing as taking <emph>him,</emph> dead or alive; and I shall be certain to tell
                  Cunningham so, just as soon as we get back again to the city! If he wants him, let
                  him come and catch the old fellow himself."</p>
               <p>"Has he gone? Have you lost him?" now inquired Tryon himself, just coming up.</p>
               <p>"Look there!" pointed the men.</p>
               <p>The Governor just glanced his eye down the haz ardous steep, and a shudder ran
                  over his frame.</p>
               <p>"The devil!" muttered the Governor, giving a long whistle with the same
                  breath.</p>
               <p>"There they are! There they are! They're after him now! They have him yet!" cried
                  out some of them quite lustily. They pointed over toward the road. The dragoons
                  who had made the circuit of the hill by the regular road, were rapidly scudding
                  away hill by the regular road, were rapidly scudding away after the escaped hero.
                  The General looked over his shoulder and saw them coming; but they were yet at
                  some distance from, and he had quite a start to begin upon. Urging his horse all
                  the time to his greatest exertions, he drove along the road to Stamfordâ€”a town
                  five miles farther east. The horsemen followed him but a short distance, and soon
                  returned to their companions, giving up the chase after <emph>such</emph> a man,
                  as a job altogether beyond their power to carry on with any hope of success.<ref

               <p>Tryon then gave orders to his troops to plunder and destroy to their heart's
                  content. In consequence they took from the inhabitants everything that was
                  valuable, destroyed the salt-works about the place, burnt a small sloop and a
                  store, and did what injury his nefarious disposition could plot against the whig
                  inhabitants.</p>
               <p>General Putnam reached Stamford in a very brief time. There were a few militia
                  posted there, which he collected together at once, and just then being joined by a
                  few of his own fellow fugitives, he hurried back to pursue and harrass the enemy
                  in turn. The latter were then on their retreat to Rye. Hovering about their rear
                  with his men, Putnam succeeded in capturing thirty-eight prisoners, and in
                  retaking a wagon-load of amunition and plunder, which they were carrying off with
                  themâ€”the latter belonging to the inhabitants of the town, to whom he made due
                  restoration of their articles.</p>
               <p>Some of the prisoners he captured were wounded, and they were all well cared for.
                  On the very next day. General Putnam dispatched an escort with all of them to the
                  British lines, that they might be exchanged for American prisoners. In return for
                  this act of generosity and humanity, a messenger was dispatched to the American
                  General soon after, bearing a complimentary note from Governor Tryon, in which he
                  urged him to accept form him the accompanying present of a suit of clothes, in
                  return for his kindness toward his prisoners.<ref rend="super" target="#note_018"

               <p>The British reached Rye, on their retreat, the same evening, and early the next
                  morning arrived at their own lines near Kings-Bridge.</p>
               <p>General Putnam despatched the following account of this expedition to the
                  Commander-in Chief: <q>
                     <p>CAMP AT READING, March 2d, 1779.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"A detachment from the enemy at Kings-Bridge, consisting of the 17th, 44th, and
                  57th British regiments, one of the Hessians, and two of new levies, marched from
                  their lines for Horseneck on the evening of the 25th ult., with the intention of
                  surprising the troops at that place, and destroying the salt works.</p>
               <p>"A captain and 30 men were sent from our advanced lines from Horseneck, who
                  discovered the enemy at New Rochelle, in advance. They retired before them
                  undiscovered as far as Rye Neck, where it growing light, the enemy observed and
                  attacked them. They defended themselves as well as possible, and made their way to
                  Sawpits, where they took advantage of a commanding piece of ground and made some
                  little stand; but the superior force of the enemy obliged them to retire over the
                  Byram-Bridge, which they took up, and by that means had an opportunity of reaching
                  Horse-neck in safety.</p>
               <p>"As I was there myself to see the situation of the guards, I had the troops formed
                  on a hill by the meeting-house, ready to receive the enemy as they advanced. They
                  came on briskly, and I soon discovered that their design was to turn their flanks
                  and possess themselves of a defile in our rear, which would effectually<pb
                     n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6939-00000045"/> fectually prevent our retreat. I
                  therefore ordered parties out on both flanks, with directions to give me
                  information of their approach, that we might retire in season. In the mean time a
                  column advanced up the main road, where the remainder of the troops (amounting to
                  about sixty) were posted. We discharged some old field pieces which were there, a
                  few times, and gave them a small file of musketry, but without any considerable
                  effect; the superior force of the enemy soon obliged our small detachment to
                  abandon the place.</p>
               <p>"I therefore directed the troops to retire and form on a hill at a little distance
                  from Horseneck, while I proceeded to Stamford and collected a body of militia and
                  a few continental troops which were there, with which I returned immediately, and
                  found that the enemyâ€”after plundering the inhabitants of the principal part of
                  their effects, and destroying a few salt-works, a small sloop and storeâ€”were on
                  their return. The officer commanding the continental troops stationed at
                  Horseneck, mistook my orders, and went much farther than I intended, so that he
                  could not come up with them to any advantage. I however ordered the few troops
                  that came from Stamford to pursue them, thinking they might have an opportunity to
                  pick up some stragglers. In this I was not mistaken, as your excellency will see
                  by the enclosed list of prisoners. Besides these, eight for nine more were taken
                  and sent offâ€”so that I cannot tell to which particular regiments they belonged;
                  one amunition and one baggage wagon were taken. In the former, there were about
                  two hundred rounds of canister grape, and round shot, suited to three pounders,
                  some slow matches, and about two hundred tubes; the later was filled with plunder,
                  which I had the satisfaction of restoring to the inhabitants from whom it was
                  taken. As I have not yet got a return, I cannot tell exactly the number we lost,
                  though I don't think more than ten soldiers, and about that number of inhabitants,
                  but a few of which were in arms.</p>

               <head type="sub">ESCAPE FROM PRISONâ€”AN AGREEABLE SURPRISE.</head>
               <p>IT was an evening of a day in the spring of the year alluded to in the last
                  chapterâ€”the year 1779â€”that a man entered the "Eel Pot" tavern in the city of New
                  York, and looked inquiringly about him. The little bar-room was as well peopled as
                  usual, and the bar itself was in the receipt of its usual patron age from thirsty
                  and idling men.</p>
               <p>The new comer was dressed in a suit of blue woolen, much worn, and supported a
                  remarkably poor hat upon his head. It looked as if he carried it round more in the
                  character of a curiosity, than of a needful protector. There was a curious
                  expression about his face, and he seemed rather to avoid, than to desire to
                  attract observation. Perhaps this noticeable peculiarity of his was ascribable
                  altogether to his years; for he appeared yet to be a young man, and of course
                  might be supposed (in <emph>those</emph> days, at least) to be possessed of some
                  share of modesty.</p>
               <p>Three or four times he walked slowly about the room, looking sharply into every
                  countenance he saw; yet there was nothing that served to brighten his eyes, or
                  lighten the sadness of his look. The door of the room before long opened again,
                  and another comer entered. Stepping briskly up to Paul Potter, the landlord, who
                  stood behind his bar, he whispered a few words in his ear, and then retired among
                  the crowd that knotted themselves about the stove in the corner of the room.</p>
               <p>The young man was standing at a little distance from the rest, attentively
                  surveying the whole group. He appeared abstracted; yet his eyes were quickly
                  turned upon the door, every time he heard it open and shut. He was startled, at
                  length, to see this same stranger who had just come in and spoken secretly with
                  the landlord, post himself directly before him and share unmercifully in his face,
                  while the color left in entirely, from fear. Still the stranger kept steadily
                  gazing at him, and at last spoke out the words:</p>
               <p>"Can I be mistaken?"</p>
               <p>The young man, not desirous of showing so much fear as might betray the secret
                  that served to weigh upon his heart, looked the speaker full in the face in
                  return, and replied:</p>
               <p>"Who do you think I am?"</p>
               <p>"Henry Byram!" was the stranger's reply.</p>
               <p>"Great God! I am betrayed!" was the exclamation of the young man.</p>
               <p>"Not by <emph>me</emph> are you," replied the stranger, "not by <emph>me!</emph>
                  But you are not safe here, Lieutenant Byram! I wonder you think you are! You are
                  liable to be taken for a spy at any moment, and hanged by morning!"</p>
               <p>"Who <emph>are</emph> you?" asked the young man, in a perplexity and fear that
                  almost overcame him.</p>
               <p>"Come with me, and I will show you!" answered the stranger. "Appear not to follow
                  me; but be certain to go in at the same door with me! Careful, now!"</p>
               <p>All this ran through the brain of the young man like an electric shock. He had not
                  expected to be thus early discoveredâ€”perhaps, even at that moment, on the point of
                  being betrayed! Following the stranger closely, however, in at the door at which
                  he saw him enter, he felt relieved at being at length clear from the gaze of the
                  multitude outside. Pushing on into another room, just at the end of a small entry,
                  he saw the stranger who had accosted him, sitting down in an arm chair before a
                  fire of wood.</p>
               <p>"Sit down here," said he to the young man, 'sit down here! You are in great danger
                  in there! Besides, I want to see you a trifle, too!"</p>
               <p>"First tell me who you are!" replied Lieutenant Byram, anxious most of all to
                  clear up that mystery.</p>
               <p>"Do you know Verd Antique?" significantly asked the stranger.</p>
               <p>"Merciful heavens!" exclaimed the young lieutenant, raising both hands.</p>
               <p>"Not one word! Noâ€”not a single syllable! You can't be too careful what you say
                  here! Remember you're right in the heart of the enemy!"</p>
               <p>"I know itâ€”I know it too well," responded young Byram; "but tell me where you came
                  from to get here! How came you here? Where are you going?"</p>
               <p>"I am one of those who are just as much at home in the camp of one army as in that
                  of the other," answered Verd-Antique to his questions, "for the whole belongs to
                  my country! I have carried not a few plans out of this city against the Americans
                  in the Highlands, and I have in two ways been the means of occasionally doing the
                  cause I love some little service, thank God! But this must not be spoken aloud,"
                  continued he, dropping his voice. "<emph>The walls</emph> even must not hear it!
                  Our only safety here lies in our <emph>months;</emph> if we can only keep
                     <emph>them</emph> shut, except to get in something to kind o' keep alive the
                  system, I predict that we're safe enough! But now, Lieutenant Byram, I want you to
                  tell me in a few words how you came here? Where came you from? Speak low'â€”you
                  can't speak too low for safety!"</p>
               <p>"About one year ago," answered the youthful officer, "I was taken prisoner near
                     Sawpits."<ref rend="super" target="#note_019" xml:id="return_019">I</ref>

               <p>"So long ago!" exclaimed Verd-Antique.</p>
               <p>"It was a quite a year ago," said Byram; "I was in the company of Lieutenant
                  Barber, of Groton, who was shot dead with the bullets of the devilish tories. Not
                  happening to be harmed myself, I was at once surrounded and made prisoner. From
                  that place I was brought to the city."</p>
               <p>"By the tories?" asked Verd-Antique.</p>
               <p>"Yes, by the tories all the way; I found out who <emph>one</emph> of them was, and
                  if I ever get clear beyond these British lines I think I shall have his name
                  registered at head-quarters!"</p>
               <p>"Who was he?"</p>
               <p>"They called him Jimâ€”Jim Marshall," answered the young officer.</p>
               <p>"It isn't possible!" exclaimed Verd-Antique, it now coming his turn to be
                  astonished. "Jim Marshall!"</p>
               <p>"Why? Do you know him? Have you ever seen him, or heard of him?" asked Lieutenant
                  Byram.</p>
               <p>"Heard of him! Seen him! Yes, I know him all the way through! Nobody can tell me
                  anything about <emph>him,</emph> that I don't know already!"</p>
               <p>"Where? When? How?" asked Byram, confusedly.</p>
               <p>"Henry Byram," answered Verd-Antique, with emphatic deliberation, "do you remember
                  the time when, a year or two ago, we passed a gang of Skinners, while we were
                  travellin' down through West chester?"</p>
               <p>"And you were taken, and came near being hanged by them?" inquired the young man,
                  in turn.</p>
               <p>"Why, yes! Don't you remember it all?"</p>
               <p>"Certainlyâ€”certainly!"</p>
               <p>"Wal, the leader of that bloody gang was Jim Marshall! the same fellow, I s'pect,
                  that brought you down here!"</p>
               <p>"Do you tell me so?"</p>
               <p>"Every word on't is true! Every word! But where have you been ever since? Here in
                  the city?"</p>
               <p>"Yesâ€”a prisoner in the Provost Prison, until this very evening," replied
                  Byram.</p>
               <p>"But they have not discharged you? How did you get out?"</p>
               <p>"I escaped in this disguise which I had an opportunity to steal. I passed myself
                  off for a tipsy loyalist, going by two sentiments, and being challenged by each
                  one of them! But they did not succeed in stopping me. I am <emph>here;</emph> now,
                  how, to <emph>get on</emph>â€”is the question!"</p>
               <p>"True enough! It's an important question, too. Where had you thought of goin',
                  lieutenant?"</p>
               <p>"To the safest place," answered he, "I wanted to pass the lines to night, if
                  possibleâ€”"</p>
               <p>"Noâ€”no! that can't be done to-night! Not to-night!"</p>
               <p>"Why not? They will be on the watch for me, perhaps, by to-morrow, and I ought to
                  make all the speed I can while there's no alarm spread."</p>
               <p>"But there's a scout out to-night in just the direction you want to go! To-morrow
                  all will be quiet."</p>
               <p>"Where shall I stay in the meantime? I am not safe here, by any means!"</p>
               <p>"You're sale <emph>only here!</emph>" replied Verd-Antique. "Paul Putter is a
                  personal friend of mine, though I am not known to him by the same name that I am
                  to you. Paul Potter is the landlord of the 'Eel Pot,' and a generous friend he is,
                  too! If he agrees to keep you here safe, he'll do exactly as he saysâ€”he'll be sure
                  to do it!"</p>
               <p>"Dare you accompany me out of the city?" asked Byram.</p>
               <p>"I happened to be about going up into our own to ritory myself, just as soon as I
                  thought the ground between this and there got a little quiet. To morrow night,
                  then, I'm your pilot; but as you love your own life, do not stay one syllable that
                  may expose you while you are here! The landlord <emph>I'll</emph> answer for
                     <emph>he's</emph> safe with any secret I have to trust with him! To-night,
                  however, I have different work to do!"</p>
               <p>"Where?" the lieutenant was incited to inquired.</p>
               <p>"In the cityâ€”with Cunningham and others."</p>
               <p>Byram could not help staring at the wonderful coolness and assurance of the man,
                  who seemed to feel the safest when in the thickest of danger. He wondered, too,
                  how he dared to enter the presence of Cunningham, the very man whose tyranny he
                  had just broken away from.</p>
               <p>"I do considerable private business for Cunningham," said Verd-Antique, seeing the
                  surprise of his<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6939-00000046"/> youthful companion; "but
                  it's under quite a different name from the one you know me by."</p>
               <p>"What?"</p>
               <p>"Kit Clemm. Did you ever hear the name!"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Where, tell me?"</p>
               <p>"In camp, at the time 'twas said that he headed a gang of villains who tried to
                  capture Old Put,"</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! ha!" laughed the disguised man; "but wasn't that a good one, by the royal
                  George! How I fooled poor Cunningham <emph>that</emph> time! He was made to
                  believe that I was really captured by the Americans before they took our party,
                  and that I was sent a deal of a ways up into the Highlands, from which I escaped
                  finally! He believes it all till this very day!"</p>
               <p>"It's strange how you got so among these fellows," replied Lieutenant Byram. "I
                  shouldn't dare risk my face in sight of them, after such a stratagem as the one
                  you practised upon them."</p>
               <p>"Reason enough for <emph>that;</emph> you wasn't <emph>bred</emph> to such
                  thingsâ€”I <emph>was!</emph> I've made such things my business! Once in a great
                  while, I find my neck in a collar, as it was when you had the goodness to take it
                  out but such lessons don't generally go unremembered by me, and the second hangin'
                  for <emph>them</emph> is always harder than the first was <emph>for
                  me!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Shall you go into Queen street to-night?" asked Byram, slightly coloring as he
                  spoke.</p>
               <p>"I shall go right through there," answered Verd-Antique. "Why?"</p>
               <p>The young man hesitated.</p>
               <p>"Any messages to send any where? Ah! I forgot, I forgot! There's a Missâ€”Missâ€”Miss
                  Somebody along there, eh?'</p>
               <p>Byram was still confused, but he was able to reply:</p>
               <p>"If you would carry a note for meâ€”"</p>
               <p>"Yes, to any door you'll mention in all the street."</p>
               <p>"Get me pen, ink and paper, then! It will not do for me to move from here!"</p>
               <p>"No," replied Verd-Antique; "and while you are drawin' up your writin', I'll be
                  talkin' the subject in to Paul. It's highly necessary for Paul Potter to be in the
                  secret, if there's to be any secret kept! I'll get pen, Ink and paper!" and with
                  these words he started out of the room.</p>
               <p>The young man was left to his reflections for but a few minutes, when his elder
                  companion returned, bringing such rude and rough materials for drawing up one's
                  sentiments on paper as the "Eel Pot"â€”by no means a literary depotâ€”furnished. Byram
                  was satisfied, to procure even any implements, which would assist him in the state
                  in which both his mind and body were, in that emergency. He leaned on the table,
                  and began to write. It was to Laura Edwardsâ€”the love of his early youth.</p>
               <p>While he was engaged upon this, Verd-Antique went into the bar-room, and held a
                  confidential conversation with the landlord. That person was at once made
                  acquainted with the state of matters, and of course exhibited no backwardness in
                  acquiescing in every safe plan Verd-Antique was disposed to bring forward. It was
                  then and there agreed that Lieut. Byram should be safely kept, in a place of
                  scretion, about the premises of the "Eel Pot," until the next evening; and after
                  Verd-Antique and Paul Potter had pledged each other, as they very often did, in a
                  glass of old Holland each, the former walked back into the room where his young
                  friend was sitting and announced himself ready to depart with the message. He took
                  it from the hand of Byram and read:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"MISS LAURA EDWARDS,<lb/> 27 Queen street."</p>
               </q>
               <p>"I know the place!" remarked he, instantly.</p>
               <p>Byram looked at him earnestly for an explanation.</p>
               <p>"I've been into that house," said Verd Antique.</p>
               <p>"You!"</p>
               <p>"Yes. I've been in there with Cunningham, and other officers. They make much of
                  her father."</p>
               <p>The young lover looked more surprised than ever.</p>
               <p>"I'll carry your letter," continued the partisan. "Don't be afraid but it will
                  reach her! Her father'll think it's from some of the British officers, at any
                  rate; and <emph>he'll</emph> not be at all surprised! So never worry but what
                  she'll get the letter! Miss Laura Edwards!â€”quite a name, to be sure! While I am
                  gone, Paul will show you where my room is. It is not safe to go in there now. I
                  shall be back in the course of the night, likely, and then you'll have a chance to
                  hear a good deal I havn't told ye! Keep your mouth shut close, and your ears and
                  eyes open! That's all!"â€”and with this specimen of volubility, Verd-Antique hurried
                  out of the room.</p>
               <p>He went the rounds he had marked out for himself, drained Cunningham of his latest
                  plans and projects, delivered the note at the door of Mr. Edwards into the hands
                  of the maid-servant, Susan, and returned to the "Eel Pot" in time for a
                  respectable night's rest. We will pass over the succeeding day and hurry on to the
                  starting point of the travellers.</p>
               <p>At about eight o'clock the next evening, two travellers might have been seen
                  emerging from the tavern aforesaid, and turning their steps northward. As the
                  reader knows already, they were Verd-Antique and lieutenant Byram; the latter in
                  the enjoyment of coveted liberty after so long a confinement. They pursued their
                  way unmolested to King's Bridge, Verd-Antique answering for both to the call of
                  the few strolling guards with whom he fell in. On they travelled until the break
                  of day; when, not yet being beyond British lines, they secreted themselves in a
                  small ledge of rocks not far from the road and prepared to await the covering of
                  the night again. It was a spot which commanded an exceedingly pleasant view, and
                  after the daylight grew glaring and broad, they discovered that they were in the
                  vicinity of a mansion. It was evidently the property of refined, if not elegant
                  people, and young lieutenant Byram began to nourish the fear of a discovery before
                  the day was over. But the self-assured manner of his companion served to quell
                  these unpleasant uprisings before long, and he gave himself up to musing on the
                  strange past, and his prospects and hopes for the future.</p>
               <p>During the dayâ€”it was in the afternoonâ€”a young and beautiful girl walked away from
                  the mansion into the grove, near which they were secreted. Both the fugitivesâ€”if
                  Verd-Antique could be called suchâ€”watching her with the most unchanging interest.
                  Occasionally she read in a low and dreamy tone from a book which she carried with
                  her, and to which she appeared to refer often. Then she sang the chorus of some
                  sweet ditty she had caught, and knew only "by ear," and it seemed to them that the
                  words were alive with melody. Verd-Antique could not avoid hunching his companion
                  once in a while, as the girl moved in a new grace in some different direction, or
                  some particularly sweet expression stole over her countenance, or the tones of her
                  musical voice thrilled a heart not at all unused to emotionâ€”and that, too, of the
                  tenderest character. At length she rose and strolled back toward the house again.
                  But young Henry Byran declared that if he should live a hundred years, he should
                  never forget the expression that sat on the face of that unknown angel.</p>
               <p>At early nightfall the two travellers stole forth from their coverts again, and
                  pressed their way to the northward. The sky was gemmed with a million stars, and
                  the air, though cool, was bracing and healthy. They struck into the road at a
                  little distance above their hiding place, and pursued their way with as much
                  unconcern as if tories, and skinners, and marauders of all descriptions, did not
                  infest the very track over which they were thus travelling.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE TORY AND THE INDIAN AGAIN.</head>
               <p>DURING that spring, Captain Howe received a furlough of several weeks, and
                  determined to improve it at and about the house of his uncle. He had not been
                  there during the whole year past, and of course knew not what had become of his
                  Mary. Anxious most of all to satisfy himself whether she had yet returned to the
                  hut of her grandmother. He procured his temporary release as soon as it could be
                  granted, and set out for the vicinity of Ridgefield Mountains in company with
                  Verd-Antique. The journey was made in a brief time on horseback, and the young
                  Captain again found himself at homeâ€”for such his uncle's residence always secured
                  to him.</p>
               <p>The old gentleman was overjoyed to see him, receiving even his travelling
                  companion with as much delight as if he were only another part of the same nephew.
                  He asked him a hundred questions; made the oldest and craziest remarks; flung in
                  congratulatory speeches by bunches; and finally grasped the hand of his young
                  nephew again and yet again, as if he could not get enough of him in an hour.</p>
               <p>The conversation turned on all subjects, more particularly those connected with
                  William's last year's experience. He ran over a list of all the engagements in
                  which he had been, retailed the usual quantity of camp narrative and camp gossip,
                  and at length began to talk of his own hopes of speedy promotion.</p>
               <p>"I do not want to get an appointment," remarked he, "by walking over the dead
                  bodies of my comrades in arms, but I should like none the less to receive
                  promotion. Perhaps I do not deserve it, but I am at <emph>least ambitious</emph>
                  of it."</p>
               <p>This was a new strain for his beneficent uncle, and he found that his zeal was
                  suddenly enkindled. His ambition was certainly after the warlike orderâ€”so far as
                  it related to his tender nephewâ€”and be hoped he might see the day when the manly
                  epaulette should dangle from his manly shoulder. The old gentleman happened to be
                  just of that age, temperament, and health, to be readily influenced by gaudy
                  trifles; and he conscientiously, and seriously thought that the glitter of a
                  bright epaulette surpassed every other goal of ambition, in respect of height and
                  glory.</p>
               <p>To Verd-Antique, who had grown to be quite a favorite with Captain Howe since the
                  day the latter had so fortunately rescued him from his perilous situation among
                  the skinners, this was a time of peculiar enjoyment. The Captain daily received
                  hints and suggestions of eminent practical value to him, and gladly did he avail
                  himself of the teachings of so thorough-bred a master. Verd Antique, to be sure,
                  was not a <emph>military</emph> character, in the strictest, or even in the strict
                  sense of that word; but he well understood the value of the work required by his
                  country in her extreme exigency. He was no theorist; no schemer; no dreamer; he
                  was in all respects a <emph>worker.</emph> His heart had long been given up to the
                  cause of his country's freedom, and he counted his time, his labor, ayâ€”<emph>his
                     life,</emph> as nothing in comparison to the value of the holy crusade upon
                  which he had entered. And he seemed to regard those who fought with his own
                  sincerity, with a feeling of peculiar friendliness. On several occasions this
                  feeling had been openly exhibited to young Captain Howe.</p>
               <p>The old gentleman grew much interested in the companion of his nephew, since the
                  latter had hinted to him of what stuff the man was made; and indulged in
                  questioning him as closely as he had the young Captain. He sat listening with
                  delight to the many adventures Verd-Antique was so willing to relate, wondering of
                  what material a person must be made who could do, dare, and suffer so much as he.
                  The old gentleman's face glowed like a furnace of coals, when Verd Antique
                  narrated to him the particulars of the Captain's releasing him from his thralldom
                  in the halter, and he was driven to get up from his chairâ€”lame as he wasâ€”and pat
                  the boy, as he called him, on the backâ€”and they were no very gentle pats, either.
                  Every thing that he had heard from either of the two unexpected comers, delighted
                  him. He had not words, out of which he could form whole sentences to express the
                  various feelings, of joy, congratulation, gratitude, and the like, that swelled up
                  from his bosom. His hands he rubbed together until it seemed as if the skin must
                  peel off from them in rolls. Then he threw back his<pb n="92-93"
                     xml:id="VAC6939-00000047"/> head exultingly in his chair, and kicked up his
                  feet as if he never knew what the gout was.</p>
               <p>As soon after their arrival as they could do so without exciting any special
                  suspicion, the Captain, his friend Verd-Antique, and the negro Buff started on an
                  excursion over the mountain and through the wood. Captain Howe acquainted
                  Verd-Antique now, for the first time, with the object of his expedition thither,
                  and the reader may reasonably presume the latter was surprised almost beyond
                  expression to find that the same evening he had already had such extended dealings
                  with, made his impious power felt even up there. When Captain Howe told him of the
                  sudden disappearance of Mary, and acquainted him with his suspicions in relation
                  to Marshall's connexion with it, it seemed as if the latter could scarce control
                  himself. He clenched his fists and gritted together his teeth, as if it would have
                  been a special delight to have met with him at that very moment. The words of the
                  young man were powerful to excite him to do something by way of bringing the tory
                  to his just punishment.</p>
               <p>After a walk of more than an hour, it being yet early in the day, they reached the
                  plain that stretched out before the old witch's hut. Verd-Antique looked at the
                  latter with the most deeply excited curiosity. He was not so free from
                  superstitious fears, as to keep out of his mind the possibility of the old woman's
                  cat being in reality the devil himself in disguise: and though he faltered none in
                  approaching the habitation, yet he could not entirely rid himself of the fear that
                  lurked within his breast.</p>
               <p>With cautious tread they moved directly up to the door. Captain Howe was in
                  advance and he laid his hand upon the wooden latch to raise it. The door opened to
                  his pressure, and he had scarcely time to look within, when a bullet whistled
                  fearfully just above his head. Verd-Antique was close on behind him, and,
                  springing past the surprised Captain, he rushed into the room and fell upon the
                  person of a man who was sitting upon the cheerless hearth.</p>
               <p>The man was Jim Marshall, the tory!</p>
               <p>There was another form that instantly rushed into the adjacent apartmentâ€”the
                  former bed room of Maryâ€”while Verd-Antique called out to his companionsâ€”"After
                  him! shoot him! take him, if you can!" It was Lariko!</p>
               <p>The wily Indian darted out of the window, but old Buff was ready for him there. He
                  had run round to the corner of the house, prepared to stop his escape in that
                  direction. The Indian went through the narrow window just as Captain Howe laid his
                  hands upon his heel, kicking his would-be captor backwards upon the floor.</p>
               <p>Back went the Captain for the door again. While he was re-crossing the floor, he
                  heard the loud report of another musket. It was that of Buff. He had discharged it
                  at the Indian, just at the moment he struck the ground. It did not bring him down,
                  however, merely maiming him in his hip. The wound greatly retarded his running,
                  but for all that he kept on as well as he could. He seemed to have a horror of
                  being taken alive.</p>
               <p>"I'm after you! Stand, or die! shouted Captain Howe, as soon as he reached the
                  door and saw how the matter was going.</p>
               <p>Still the Indian kept a running. The Captain kept on after him, and Buff was doing
                  his very best with the muscular power that was yet folded away in his legs. He
                  made headway very fast, and the Indian looked over his shoulder to see that he
                  would soon lay hold of him. Determined not to be taken alive, he wheeled and
                  pushed for the edge of the precipice. It was but a few rods from the door of the
                  hut, and he was there before his pursuer. The Captain regarded his manÅ“uvre with
                  horror, and stood still in his tracks, unable to proceed farther. Just as Buff
                  thought to lay hold of the fugitive and draw him back from the perilious
                  declivity, the latter raised his face to the sky uttered a shrill and piercing
                  cry,â€”a cry of the deepest agonyâ€”and made a plunge downwards into the pond that
                  slept beneath! Buff dared follow no farther. He was stupified already with what he
                  saw, and halted. But as soon as they recovered a little from their surprise, both
                  hurried round to a point whence they might look down upon the water of the lake.
                  They could see the broad circlesâ€”each one growing broaderâ€”but they watched in vain
                  for any signs of human being. For some moments they continued looking; but the
                  Indian never showed himself. Believing that so fearful a plunge, combined from the
                  loss of his strength from the wound he received, had destroyed him forever, they
                  returned to the hut again.</p>
               <p>As soon as they looked within they saw what had been done by their very efficient
                  co-adjutor, Verd-Antique. He had already secured the tory with cords, and was then
                  sitting over him, while he lay stretched upon the floor. The Captain heard but
                  this last fragment of their conversation just as he entered:</p>
               <p>"Let me go! I <emph>beg</emph> you!" pleaded the tory, looking beseechingly up
                  into the face of his stout captor.</p>
               <p>"Let you go!" replied Verd-Antique, "<emph>in course,</emph> I shan't let you go!
                  Didn't you never git <emph>my</emph> neck in a halter, hey? Didn't you never set
                     <emph>me</emph> to begging for <emph>my</emph> life?â€”and was you goin' to spare
                  me at all, if my friend Cap'n Howe hadn't come up jest then! Tell me
                     <emph>that,</emph> will ye!"</p>
               <p>"But I got my pay for that," replied the tory.</p>
               <p>"How got your pay?" asked Verd-Antique.</p>
               <p>"Didn't I and a dozen more of us get our backs all cut up with them birches? Have
                  I forgot that?"</p>
               <p>"You <emph>never</emph> got your pay," said Verd-Antique, "but I'm thinking you
                  will, though! There's no more get away for you <emph>this</emph> time! We shall
                  take pertickler care that you don't leave us a minnit! You don't know nothin'
                  about this gal, eh? Don't know nothin' about shootin' down an American officer
                  over at Sawpits, eh? Don't know nothin', nuther, about carryin' a prisoner you
                  took into New York, and there keepin' him shet up in that cussed Provost, eh!
                  Don't know nothin' about all thisâ€”nothin' at all, eh!"</p>
               <p>"Let me go but this once, and I'll promise you <emph>anything,</emph>" said the
                  tory.</p>
               <p>"So the devil promised some one onst!" replied Verd-Antique, "when he got up onto
                  a place jest like this that we're on! <emph>He</emph> made big promises, tooâ€”but
                  how much <emph>land</emph> did he own? Jim Marshallâ€”you black-hearted toryâ€”you
                  promised Old Put onst! You promised him as solemn as ever any body promised
                     <emph>anything,</emph> that you'd leave off your wicked works, and fight for
                  your country and your brethren! He tried you; and how did you perform your
                  promise?"</p>
               <p>"Anything, oh <emph>anything,</emph> if you will but let me go!" said the tory,
                  now beginning to fear more than he had before for the length of his neck: "let
                  them catch the Indian! let 'em have <emph>him!</emph> Let <emph>me</emph> go, and
                  I promise you, by all that's holy, that you shan't be the lose by it!"</p>
               <p>"I'm to work in too good a cause, to let such an enemy to it as you are, slip from
                  my fingers!" replied the partisan. "There's no use in your beggin' of
                     <emph>me;</emph> if you've got any <emph>beggin'</emph> to do, you'd better
                  save all your breath till you get where Old Put is! <emph>He's</emph> the one, I
                  reckon, what you'll have to do your business with! So keep your power to yourself!
                  Don't seek to influence <emph>me!</emph> I'm above it, I tell you! I <emph>can't
                     be</emph> bribed, and I despise you the more for <emph>thinkin</emph> I
                  can!"</p>
               <p>"Good!" exclaimed Captain Howe, now stepping up to the prisoner and his captor.
                  "Now lift him up into that chair, John, and let him get his breath a trifle. This
                  is no specially new work for him, but it <emph>may be</emph> before he gets all
                  through with it."</p>
               <p>Verd-Antique helped to raise his prisoner from the floor. As soon as the latter
                  saw the face of Captain Howe, his sworn and implacable enemy, he preserved a
                  silence, and gazed sullenly down upon the floor.</p>
               <p>"Where's the t'other one?â€”the Injun?" inquired Verd-Antique.</p>
               <p>"In the bottom of the pond," replied the Captain.</p>
               <p>"What! Below that precipice!" exclaimed the astonished partisan.</p>
               <p>"Yes," answered Captain Howe. "That's the place for him! He'll do very little more
                  mischief there!"</p>
               <p>"Heavens! Did he jump off there?"</p>
               <p>"Yesâ€”he took but a single plunge! He's deader than the rock he jumped from, by
                  this time."</p>
               <p>"No question about that," returned the amazed partisan, looking at his prisoner.
                  The latter showed every sign of excessive fright, on hearing that his companion in
                  iniquity had come to so fearful an end. His face was paler than the ashes that yet
                  remained upon the hearth. He looked wildly round the room, and seemed able to rest
                  his eyes permanently upon no particular object. How his cruel heart must have sunk
                  within him, at knowing that his doom was now so close upon him! How must all his
                  nefarious deeds have crowded themselves upon his memory, while he turned and saw
                  that the time for their reward had finally come! How worse than a really condemned
                  man must he have felt himself, as he looked forward to the single faint ray of
                  hope that fell across his brief future, and then backward into his own heart, to
                  find that he <emph>deserved</emph> the very retribution he already began so much
                  to dread!</p>
               <p>Captain Howe stood before the guilty-looking prisoner, and addressed him:</p>
               <p>"Jim Marshall, as you hope for final pardon for the great wrong you have done,
                  tell me what you have done with the girl whom you abducted from this place, a year
                  ago!"</p>
               <p>The tory returned no answer.</p>
               <p>"If you refuse to answer me now," continued he, "then you may be sure that it will
                  go harder with you when you come to your trial before the competent authorities.
                  Silence <emph>now,</emph> and punishment <emph>then!</emph>â€”is <emph>that</emph>
                  your choice in this matter?"</p>
               <p>The prisoner hesitated a brief moment whether to speak or not At length he
                  replied:</p>
               <p>"Cap'n Howe, I don't know nothin' of the gal?"</p>
               <p>"You are a liar, if you say it!" said the young man.</p>
               <p>At any other time, and under almost any other circumstances, the tory would have
                  been inclined to resent ruch a charge as this; but either his courage had become
                  so depressed by his unexpected capture, or his guilt boiled and bubbled so
                  strongly within him, that he seemed to take no notice of the affront, and
                  continued to gaze with his passionless look upon the floor.</p>
               <p>"You know, as well as <emph>I</emph> do," continued Captain Howe, "that you
                  carried that girl away from here by force! You <emph>know</emph> very well what
                  you have threatened, again and again, respecting my making her my wifeâ€”all
                  voluntary and needless threats, made only to annoy her and avenge yourself on me
                  for a wrong you conceive I did you several years ago. Speak, and tell me if you
                  did not carry her away!"</p>
               <p>No reply came from the lips of the tory.</p>
               <p>"Where did you carry her? In what direction?" continued the young officer.</p>
               <p>The tory shook his head negatively.</p>
               <p>"Where, then, is the old witch? Where is <emph>she?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I don't know," replied Marshall.</p>
               <p>"You <emph>do</emph> know, I believe!" rejoined Capt. Howe. "Have you murdered
                     <emph>her</emph> for what few valuables you suppose she possesses? Is this
                     <emph>another</emph> crime, to be added to the long and black list?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed. I have not seen her," said the prisoner. "We only came in here a quarter
                  of an hour, or so, before you did. Nobody was here <emph>then;</emph> the house
                  was all deserted. The fire was all out, too!"</p>
               <p>"Do you tell me the truth?" asked Captain Howe.</p>
               <p>"As I live," replied the prisoner.</p>
               <p>"Where can she have gone?"</p>
               <p>"I thought, ma' be, after her her gal. I didn't know that she was lost before,
                  though"</p>
               <p>Captain Howe stood and regarded his prisoner a moment in reflective silence. The
                  miserable wretch had tripped himself in the very last sentence he uttered<pb
                     n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6939-00000048"/> tered, and so palpable was nis wrong
                  intent, that the mind of the young man regarding him was divided between anger and
                  disgust.</p>
               <p>"You lying, malicious monster!" finally exclaimed the young man. "You
                     <emph>do</emph> know where the girl has gone, and you shall be made to tell me
                  what you helped do with her! I have feared the worst from the beginning about her!
                  I feared that your mercenary, malicious heart would not hesitate to sacrifice her
                  for your purpose, at any time; and I now know that I have not been disappointed in
                  my fears! Wretch that you are!â€”you <emph>shall</emph> give up all you know of the
                  girl! You shall be <emph>made</emph> to do it! Come along with us!"</p>
               <p>Verd-Antique was at the prisoner's elbow to help him to a start. He seemed
                  reluctant to go, and would have plead hard for his release, or for even the
                  privilege of being carried in another direction; but he knew too well the
                  determined character of the men who had him in their power, and his tongue refused
                  its wonted office.</p>
               <p>Poor, miserable man! Going as straight and as surely to the outlaw's grave, as if
                  he had dog it with his own hands, and with care prepared his own shroud! Wretched
                  outcast! who on earth was there living with a throb of sympathy for
                     himâ€”<emph>him</emph> the forgotten, loathsome being he had but made himself by
                  his own course!</p>
               <p>The three persons marched away their prisoner to the house of the Captain's uncle,
                  where he was secured and properly guarded. It gave old Buff a peculiar
                  satisfaction to sit and watch the enemy he hated so much.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIX.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE TRIAL AND EXECUTION.</head>
               <p>ON a lovely day in June, there was quite a stir at the head-quarters of General
                  Putnam, at Buttermilk Falls, on the Hudson. There was a company of soldters, under
                  arms, drawn up before an old building near the one where the General quartered,
                  and the excitement all around the spot was fast increasing. Men looked up at the
                  windows, and wondered what would be the next thing to happen, and then spake their
                  convictions to one another in low and cautious voices.</p>
               <p>But to know the legitimate cause of this unusual parade of the militia, let us go
                  into one of the rooms of the house.</p>
               <p>As we enter, there are to be seen the figures of General Putnam and others of his
                  officers behind a long table, upon which are placed pen, ink, and paper. A man
                  sits in the middle of the room, directly before them, his arms secured behind him
                  with a rope, or small cord. Around the room are ranged several officers of various
                  grades, looking on as deeply interested spectators in the affair. Among the rest,
                  are to be seen Captain Howe, Lieut, Byram and Verd-Antique.</p>
               <p>The man sitting bound was Jim Marshallâ€”the tory!</p>
               <p>"Marshall," began General Putnam, "you are no new comer to our board! We have had
                  an acquaintance of some long standing with you, and know you now pretty well! You
                  are brought here to-day, charged with the crime of belonging to a party, who, at
                  Sawpits, waylaid and shot one American officer and carried another a prisoner into
                  New York, within the enemy's power. This is the principal offence with which we
                     <emph>now</emph> charge you, yet there are many others that are not far off.
                  Answer, then, to this oneâ€”Are you guilty, or not guilty of the crime of murdering
                  an American officer?"</p>
               <p>"General Putnam," replied the wretched prisoner, "I am <emph>not</emph> guilty of
                  murder! I never did the thing!"</p>
               <p>"They you deny the whole of this charge, do you?" asked the General.</p>
               <p>"I aint guilty of any such thing, General Putnam. You may hang me, if you will,
                  but I never did it!"</p>
               <p>"Lieutenant Byram," called out the General, "will you step forward!"</p>
               <p>The young man at once advanced to the middle of the room, where he confronted the
                  prisoner.</p>
               <p>"Have you ever seen this prisoner before?" asked General Putnam.</p>
               <p>"Many times, General," was his reply.</p>
               <p>"Where?"</p>
               <p>"The first time I ever saw him to know him, he was at the head of a gang of
                  scoundrelly skinners. He suffered my friend, John Horton here, who was with me,
                  and myself to pass; but we had gone on but a few yards, before he and his men
                  drove on after us. They caught my friend, but I escaped <emph>that</emph> time.
                  The next time I saw himâ€”but it is not essential to recapitulate this. I will only
                  testify that I was walking near our outposts at Sawpits, a little more than a year
                  ago, with Lieut, Barber, when we were suddenly surrounded by a concealed party of
                  tories and fired upon. Lieut, Barber fell dead upon the spot. I was taken a
                  prisoner, and carried off to New York, and there confined in prison for a full
                  year. I have just escaped."</p>
               <p>"Was this Marshall one of the party who fired upon you, and who murdered Lieut,
                  Barber?" asked one of the officers sitting on the right hand of General
                  Putnam.</p>
               <p>"He was," answered Lieut, Byram.</p>
               <p>"Should you be able to identify him without any fears of a mistake?" inquired
                  another member of the court.</p>
               <p>"I should. Not only did I hear the prisoner's name called, but, as he assisted in
                  conducting me away, I became well acquainted with his personal appearance."</p>
               <p>"Is this prisoner the same with the Marshall who fired with others upon you, and,
                  after killing Lieut, Barber, carried you off a prisoner to New York?" asked
                  General Putnam.</p>
               <p>Lieut, Byram looked steadily for half a minute in the face of the prisoner, while
                  the latter just as steadfastly kept his gaze fixed upon the floor, and
                  answeredâ€”</p>
               <p>"It is the same person."</p>
               <p>"It is enough," replied General Putnam, "Gentlemen, I see no need of any further
                  testimony. The case is already made out, so far as I can see. Guard! clear the
                  room!"</p>
               <p>Instantly the room was cleared, and the several members of the court proceeded to
                  lay their heads together, preparatory to arriving at a fixed conclusion in the
                  matter. Certainly, the testimony was direct enough, while there were no
                  circumstances that could be presented as calculated to palliate the offence
                  charged upon the prisoner. The latter still sat in the middle of the room, able to
                  overhear their loud, buzzing whispersâ€”each of them full of meaning with reference
                  so his own fateâ€”yet unable to catch more than occasional words, far apart, and
                  fragmentary.</p>
               <p>It took them not long to decide upon a question of which there seemed to be but
                  one side to present. The court resumed their seats and their gravity; the room
                  began to fill with those who had left it; and General Putnam, looking the prisoner
                  directly in the face, pronounced the decree of the court.</p>
               <p>"Marshall," said he, in a most earnest and impressive manner.</p>
               <p>The man's eyes were rivetted on him.</p>
               <p>"You well understand why you have been brought here, as you likewise know the
                  difficulty already experienced in getting you here: Twice have you deceived us,
                  and deceived us grossly. This time is no time for deception. What have you to say
                  for yourself, that sentence should not be pronounced upon you for the crime of
                  murder, of which this court doth find you guilty?"</p>
               <p>The unhappy man, still not altogether brought down to a sense of his wickedness
                  and crimes, paused and hesitated a moment. The General, seeing the effort he made
                  to speak, interrupted him withâ€”</p>
               <p>"We are all disposed to be lenient towards you, Marshall, and will allow you to
                  say anything you can properly say in exculpation of yourself."</p>
               <p>"Generalâ€”General Putnam!" began the prisoner, and here he faltered.</p>
               <p>"Say on!" encouraged the General.</p>
               <p>The hearts of every one in the room at that moment beat wildly with excitement,
                  and their very breaths were hushed to hear what the man might have to say for
                  himself.</p>
               <p>"I am no murderer, General Putnam," continued he swallowing as if with exceeding
                  difficulty, "and I never <emph>hope</emph> to be! I did not shoot the officer you
                  charge me with shooting! I know that I have broken my promise to youâ€”</p>
               <p>"Yes, your solemn Bible <emph>oath!</emph>" interrupted Gen. Putnam.</p>
               <p>"I broke it, and deserted from your corps just when I might have been of great
                  good to them; for I know where to find them skinners, and if I'd been a mind to, I
                  could ha' carried your men right to 'em! I done wrong, General, I allow! I'm sorry
                  for it, and it you'd but try me agin, I'd do better!"</p>
               <p>At this point he paused a moment.</p>
               <p>"Is that all you would say?" inquired the commander.</p>
               <p>"Noâ€”no!" responded the man, anxious to ward off his impending doom to the last
                  possible moment. "I've got much more that I could say, Generalâ€”much more! I know
                  that folks call me a tory, but I don't know why I should be punished on
                     <emph>that</emph> account!"</p>
               <p>"You are <emph>not</emph> to be punished for that," replied the General; "you are
                  to be punished for the crime of <emph>murder</emph>â€”not for having been a
                     <emph>tory!</emph> You <emph>was</emph> punished for that, as your back will
                  probably show this very day! You are an American soldier, for you once took the
                  oath of allegiance to this countryâ€”to your country! And while sworn to support
                  that cause, that ought to be dear to your heartâ€”if ever you had a heartâ€”you have
                  assisted to commit the crime of deliberate murder! That is the offence for which
                  the time of your retribution has at last come!"</p>
               <p>"I've no more to say, General," added the prisoner, looking down upon the floor,
                  while his face grew suddenly more pale than ever;" no more, General! I've said and
                  done all I could! There be those here who could save me if they would! But they
                  won'tâ€”no, I <emph>know</emph> they won't!" and he shrugged his shoulders and
                  settled himself down deeply in his chair, as if in a fit of despair and sullen
                  gloom.</p>
               <p>"If you have nothing more to say," replied General Putnam, "you have but little to
                  oppose to the judgment of this court. It is the unanimous opinion of this body,
                  that you are <emph>guilty</emph> of the crime of murder. There is no doubt on that
                  subject in the mind of any one of us. Neither are there any mitigating
                  circumstances, so far as you have shown, of which you may avail yourself in your
                  critical situation. Being found guilty, it is therefore the decision of this court
                  that sentence shall be immediately passed upon you; which sentence isâ€”that you be
                  taken from your place of confinement between the hours of seven and nine o'clock
                  to-morrow, to the gibbet, and there be hanged by your neck between the heavens and
                  the earth! And may God have mercy upon you!"</p>
               <p>All seemed to breathe freer, after this sentence was pronounced. They began to
                  whisper to each other about the room, and in a brief time the entire apartment was
                  a scene of confusion.</p>
               <p>The prisoner sat calm and unmoved. No one could see that he had any feelings, so
                  stolid, and cold, and indifferent seemed he to everything going on around him. His
                  eyes still were fixed upon the floor, yet no signs of penitence or sorrow
                  exhibited themselves at their lids. He looked the same man he would have looked,
                  had he been assured of a prolongation of his life to fifty years more.</p>
               <p>"Remand the convict to his quarters!" ordered the General.</p>
               <p>The guard at once proceeded to remove him from the room. When they both reached
                  the door, the former conducted the latter into the hollow square already formed by
                  the soldiery, and, closing up at<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6939-00000049"/> once,
                  all marched off silently to the place where the condemned man was to be
                  imprisoned, Arrived at the door, the guard conducted him up a pair of stairs, and
                  secured him within one of the rooms of the upper floor.</p>
               <p>The windows of this room, of which there were two, were strongly barricaded, to
                  prevent the escape of just such prisoners as Marshal was, whenever they might be
                  inclined to hazard a trial of it. Marshall's arms and legs were properly secured
                  as soon as he entered the room. If that were not precaution enough, a sentinel was
                  constantly pacing before his doorâ€”back and forthâ€”while another kept up the same
                  form of exercise beneath the windows, Even if the prisoner had succeeded in
                  getting clear from his letters, he would have been sure to receive a ball in some
                  tender part of his body, the moment he showed it beyond the precincts assigned
                  him.</p>
               <p>Standing by the window of his roomâ€”for his fetters, though abundantly secure,
                  still left him ample liberty to move about his apartmentâ€”he gazed off over the
                  distant hills with the strangest feelings he ever had any knowledge of. There was
                  heâ€”a condemned men! All about his eyes was his own country, that ought to have
                  been dear to him. Instead of being respected by those who lived on the same soil
                  on which he was born, he was chased, captured, and condemned by them! and on the
                  morrow, he was to be <emph>hung</emph> in their presence! How bitter were such
                  thoughts! How they stung his heart! How they lashed him, worse than a thousand
                  scorpions! What would he not have given at that hour, had he the power to destroy
                  himselfâ€”to crush out his very existence! What, that be had never even been born!
                  But why come these rushing, boiling, scorching thoughts, just at this moment? Why
                  were all these hellish phantoms kept in reserve to torture his soul at this last
                  hour of its earthly existence? Why were there so many fingers pointing at him our
                  of the viewless airâ€”why so many plain handwritings on the very walls of his room,
                  every time his eyes turned upon themâ€”each finger, each letter, each sentence
                  telling him how black was the character he had been all his life in earning; and
                  how dreadful, yet just, the doom that yawned like a fathomless abyss before
                  him?</p>
               <p>Was there no comfort for him even in solitude?â€”none in his own thoughts? No
                  consolation for his pricked heart in being shut up out of the sight of the enemies
                  he had been all his life time in making? If none in this, then <emph>where</emph>
                  could he look for it, expecting to find it? On earthâ€”now here! Then in
                     <emph>another world?</emph> Should he find it thereâ€”any shelter there?</p>
               <p>He trembled from head to feet, as the thought flashed across him! He dreaded that
                  future, because it was unknown to himâ€”because he certainly could not promise
                  himself that he would escape the same harrowing thoughts that rent his heart in
                  pieces even here! He should be himselfâ€”the same Jim Marshallâ€”after he was gone;
                  certainly. Then if so wretched <emph>now,</emph> how expected he to be free from
                  the same reproaches after his body should have been cut down and flung away
                  to-morrow!</p>
               <p>He got but a glimpse of his awful situationâ€”he <emph>could</emph> not have
                  comprehended it all. That single, fearful glimpse alone sufficed to bring him back
                  to the nature that had been first implanted in him, though now overrun with the
                  foulest weeds and the wildest briars. He remembered of being once taught to pray
                  could he pray now?</p>
               <p>He essayed it. It was in vain. He had no <emph>words</emph>â€”no thoughtsâ€”he knew
                  not how the great God that made us all should be addressed!</p>
               <p>He strode across his room, as fast as his fetters permitted him, and threw himself
                  on the cot that stood in its corner. There he lay for a long time, extended upon
                  his back, his eyes rolled up imploringly to the dingy ceiling. His lips
                  occasionally <emph>moved,</emph> and be muttered broken sentences. But he could
                  not pray. He knew nothing of that. His was a soul that was for the first time
                  smitten; but so much smitten with fear, that he sunk exhausted under every effort
                  to rally his thoughts upon other and higher purposes. What a wreck was he! A spyâ€”a
                  deserterâ€”an abductor of defenceless femalesâ€”a robberâ€”a <emph>murders!</emph> Had
                  he not faithfully reached the end of the fearful catalogue?</p>
               <p>It was late in the evening, when he expressed to the sentinel a desire that
                  Captain Howe be sent for. Complying with the dying man's request, the guard
                  dispatched a messenger to the quarters of that officer with the intelligence that
                  the prisoner could not close his eyes in sleep until he had seen him. The Captain
                  obeyed the summons with alacrity, his heart refusing not, and hesitating not, in
                  such an hour as that, to afford the condemned man all the consolation and
                  assistance within his power.</p>
               <p>He arrived in a few moments at the door of the convict's apartment, and requesting
                  the sentinel to enter with him, went in. They found the condemned man sitting on
                  the edge of his cot, groaning deeply. The moment his eyes rested on the
                  countenance of Capt. Howe, he exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"Captain, I have wronged you, and I want to make you all the reparation I
                  can."</p>
               <p>Captain Howe merely remarkedâ€”himself deeply touched by the manner and tone of his
                  old enemyâ€”that he was not conscious of having sought to do him any injury, but
                  that in everything he had done towards his capture, he had consulted only the
                  common good. He assured him that he did not allow his personal feelings to
                  influence him in the matter for which he was so soon to suffer, but had already
                  tried to forgive him for all his wrong; and if his heart had not greatly deceived
                  him, he had forgiven him, as he hoped himself to be forgiven for all his own many
                  shortcomings.</p>
               <p>Such a sentiment touched the tender point in the nature of the criminal. His voice
                  faltered, while he tried to speak, and tears moistened his eyes.</p>
               <p>"I told you a lie, Captain Howe," said be, at length, "about that gal! I
                     <emph>did</emph> take her from that hut of the old witch by force! The Indian
                  was with me, and he helped me! We carried her to another hut we had of our own in
                  the words, not more than a mile from there! The same night we went off to the
                  southward with her, bearing direct for New York! We didn't reach the British lines
                  the first night, and had to halt till the next one, before we could go on! Then we
                  travelled on as long as I thought 'twas bestâ€”for I knew we sh'd have to make
                  another day of it, at the slow rate we was goin', and then we all halted, and the
                  Indian and I built her up a sleepin' place of brush, and boughs, and leaves. By
                  some means, while I was left to watch her, I fell asleep. And when I woke up
                  again, she was gone! We never were more astonished than to lose her; but we didn't
                  know what was to be done but start of in pursuit. We reckoned she'd come back home
                  again, and so we started back northward; but never have I seem her since, nor has
                  the Indian either. We reached the hut as soon as we could again, but we saw no
                  girl there. She hadn't been there, and we havn't thought she ever come back again,
                  where she went, or where she is, God only knows! I wish <emph>I</emph> did, for I
                  would like to ask her forgiveness for the wrong I've done her'"</p>
               <p>"Are these all words of truth?" asked Captain Howe.</p>
               <p>"Captain," replied the criminal, "I've no need to lie <emph>now</emph> no longer!
                  I'm a dying man, and feel that my sands are fast runnin' out! What I've told you,
                  God above knows is the truthâ€”the whole of it! I only wish I could ask the
                  forgiveness of the girl. Captain Howe! But you may see her aginâ€”God grant you may!
                  and tell her that I died, a sorrowing man for the wrongs and insults I'd heaped
                  upon her!"</p>
               <p>The young officer assured him that he should execute his last wish with all
                  possible haste, after once he had got a clue to the where about of Mary. He
                  regretted most of all, however, that he was not able to learn from the prisoner's
                  lips where she was.</p>
               <p>"When you do find her, Captain, "said the wretched man, "do you marry her!â€”and may
                  God bless you with her! She's every whit worthy to make you a wife! She'll prove
                  all that's good to you. God only assist you in finding her!"</p>
               <p>Captain Howe, perceiving that this was the chief matter upon which the prisoner
                  wished to see him, did not protract his visit beyond the time when he saw that the
                  convict had communicated all he wished. Taking, therefore, his hand as he rose to
                  go, he bade him a truly affectionate, yet saddening farewell, expressing the hope
                  that they would meet again in a world were all temptations to violence and wrong
                  were not known.</p>
               <p>At an early hour the next morning, while the chaplain was still administering all
                  the consolation in his power to the wretched prisoner, the drums began to roll
                  near the guard-house, and the soldiers appointed to do duty on the occasion began
                  to form in line. Going through such simple evolutions as were necessary, they
                  stood in order before the door of the guard-house, ready to receive the prisoner
                  the moment the chaplain had offered him his last comforting and admonitory
                  words.</p>
               <p>It was a calm, beautiful morning, the air sweeter than if perfumed with all the
                  spices from Araby. Fragrance rose to the nostrils from a million flowers that
                  raised their heads over the deep green meadow, or on the outskirts of the dense
                  forests. Gusts of fresh air swept up from the noble river, invigorating those on
                  whom they fell. There was a glory in everything created.</p>
               <p>But there was a sad scene to be inserted in all this glorious frame-work. The
                  death of a criminal on a beautiful morning in June! What a contrast!</p>
               <p>The doomed man marched slowly down the stairs, his eyes red with weeping. Either
                  fear, or remorse, or sorrow of the most poignant character, had softened him. His
                  heart had been smitten, and the waters began to flow from that heart so long of
                  stone!</p>
               <p>The soldiers received him in their midst, and then closed up around him. He was
                  clad in a long white robe, and wore the cap of death, the gallow's cap, on his
                  head. He walked at a slow pace, firm and undaunted. Could
                     courageâ€”<emph>true</emph> courageâ€”have been infused into that coward heart, at
                  the last hour?</p>
               <p>When they reached the place of execution, all the troops were drawn up about it,
                  and the General and his officers were grouped at their head. The prisoner gave but
                  a single look at them, and then at the preparations for his end. As he did the
                  latter, a convulsive shudder ran over him, and his face grew bloodless. Yet his
                  step continued firm, and his eye lost none of its wild expression. Perhaps it had
                  become softened a trifle in its tone, but that was all.</p>
               <p>Slowly and sadly his funeral escort marched on until they rested at the foot of
                  his gallows. There they halted, and the condemned man had time to contemplate the
                  awfulness of his situation. <emph>That</emph> he might do, but he could never
                     <emph>understand</emph> it fully. A man in his place <emph>cannot</emph> fully
                  comprehend the doom that hangs over him, with its endless and numberless
                  consequences.</p>
               <p>To the right and left the soldiery opened the way, and the unhappy man marched
                  through with apparently as firm a tread as ever. His cheeks were blanched; but if
                  with fear, certainly he betrayed no fear by any other sign. The executioner, whose
                  duty it regularly was, conducted him to the foot of the rude gallows, and thence
                  up the stairs. Arrived on the top stair, he adjusted the noose about the
                  prisoner's neck, drew down the black cap below his eyes, and himself descended the
                  stairs. General Putnam then called out from his saddleâ€”</p>
               <p>"Sentence of death will now be executed upon this criminal, who had been convicted
                  of murder! Hangman! do your duty!"</p>
               <p>In a instant the frail temporary scaffolding was level with the ground, while the
                  body of the outlaw and the tory swung high between earth and heaven! He struggled
                  with the throes of departing life for a few moments, and then all was still, the
                  body was<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6939-00000050"/> suffered to remain suspended for
                  some time, after which it was cut down by the executioner, and laid in an exposed
                  position within the coffin ready to receive it. Then the drums began their rolling
                  again, and the word was given by the commanding officer for all to march. The
                  whole body under arms was marched round in single file by the corpse, that they
                  might, every man of them, detest toryism and its consequent crimes.</p>
               <p>The outlaw was no more! He had gone to his last account!</p>

               <head type="sub">UNEXPECTED INTERVIEW</head>
               <p>Anxious to frame any pretext by which he might possibly regain his lost one,
                  Captain Howe assiduously waited upon General Putnam, until he had extorted
                  permission from him to take a force of thirty men and scout in the country below,
                  even to the enemy's line, if it should not be too hazardous According he mounted
                  as fine a horse as he could then command, well trained to all manner of hardship,
                  and marched silently out from headquarters at the head of his command, early one
                  morning not long after the execution recorded in the last chapter.</p>
               <p>They pursued their way with no special interruption through the whole of that day,
                  and at night encamped but a few miles above the "neutral ground" The men lay on
                  their arms to guard against surprise, and faithful sentinels were posted about to
                  give timely alarm of the approach of any object threatening danger. The night
                  passed, however, with no incident calculated to excite their fearsâ€”if any they
                  hadâ€”and at early morning they commenced their irregular march again over the road.
                  Each man consulted chiefly his own case in getting along, yet none were so
                  careless as to forget that a sudden summons might call them to their posts.</p>
               <p>Just at evening, when the stars first began to peep through the deep azure sky,
                  they found themselves quite upon the edge of the British lines, yet had they
                  alarmed no picquet or advanced guard of the enemy. Unwilling to proceed any
                  further then, Capt. Howe ordered his men to halt and refresh themselves; and all
                  at once sat down by the road side. A guard was stationed in their front and rear,
                  to give notice of any approaching enemy.</p>
               <p>They had not long been in this position, when the sentinel in advance hurried back
                  to them, informing them that a small party of British were at that moment coming
                  up the road. Their commander, he said, was mounted, and they were coming along at
                  a pretty brisk pace. Immediately the word was given to all the men to form and
                  retire to a defile, or gorge in the road, some thirty or fifty yards in their
                  rear, and there lay in wait for the enemy when he should advance. In an instant
                  the entire body were upon their feet, hurrying away in good order to the point
                  commanded.</p>
               <p>They took their position upon both sides of the road, concealing themselves behind
                  trees, rocks, and stumps, as they most conveniently offered themselves. What made
                  their position still a more favorable one, it was in a sort of dell, down to which
                  the road was for a short distance somewhat precipitous, or what might more
                  expressly be termed <emph>pitchy.</emph> They awaited, with suppressed breathing,
                  the word of their commander, who had stationed himself as much out of view,
                  likewise, as possible.</p>
               <p>Before many minutes, they distinctly heard the tramp and the voices of the
                  approaching party, unsuspicious of the ambush that had been laid for them. Their
                  commander said nothing that they could hear, but the inharmonious voices of the
                  men were distinctly audible, and so were their words.</p>
               <p>"A gang of skinners!" whispered one of Captain Howe's men to another.</p>
               <p>"Noâ€”cow, boys, as I live!" was the instant reply.</p>
               <p>"I can charge into <emph>them</emph> with a better will than if they were a party
                  of outright British!" remarked the first.</p>
               <p>"Forward, men! Forward!" rang through the defile from the lips of Captain
                  Howe.</p>
               <p>On the instant, the muskets were discharged obliquely into the advancing body, and
                  before they had time to recover themselves from their sudden alarm and consequent
                  confusion, the bayonets of the American party were close upon them. Heedless of
                  the excited orders of their commander, they took to their heelsâ€”those who had not
                  fallen before the discharge of musketry, and fled with precipitation. Their
                  commander turned, and, seeing what his men were about, immediately wheeled
                  entirely round and rods after them.</p>
               <p>"Back to your places! Form again! In God's nameâ€”form and charge on these rebels!"
                  he commanded with all the power that yet remained to lungs excessively hoarse; but
                  not a man heeded his words, and in a moment the rout became general, he himself
                  joining in it from a necessity he could not have foreseen.</p>
               <p>Captain Howe at once put spurs to his horse, and led on his men at the top of
                  their speed. He had his keen eye upon the flying commander of the cow-boy troop,
                  and had suddenly formed his determination to take him and carry him up to
                  head-quarters. He would form a trophy worthy to be put on exhibition there.</p>
               <p>On and on he rode, leading up his excited men with a voice of encouragement as
                  well as by his own example, and shouting to them not to suffer a single fugitive
                  to escape. They followed closely on after him, halloing at the top of their
                  voices. Their yells and shouts made the woods ring with echoes. The enemy drove
                  on. So likewise did the Americans Once or twice Captain Howe thought he had his
                  manâ€”the mounted commander of the gangâ€”and just at that moment he slipped him. In a
                  brief time each man of the American party seemed to have single out his object of
                  pursuit, and the race seemed to have become a personal oneâ€”one after another.
                  Seeing how it was, Captain Howe again drove the rowels into the flanks of his
                  horse, and hurried on after the flying leader of the enemy.</p>
               <p>The pursuit was kept up hotly for more than a mile. At length they came in sight
                  of a mansion, standing back upon somewhat elevated ground, by which the road swept
                  in a broad curve southward. Seeing no other possible chance of safety, and
                  forgetful entirely where he was, the hotly pursued fugitive leaped suddenly from
                  his horse and rushed up the gradual ascent to the house. Flying by a small
                  partyâ€”chiefly of ladiesâ€”who sat upon the piazza, he entered the hall and drove
                  into the parlor.</p>
               <p>By if he thought to escape from his active and persevering pursuer in
                     <emph>this</emph> way, he had certainly omitted to count the cost of his
                  undertaking. Captain Howe's horse was just upon him as he entered the gate, while
                  his rider ordered him sternly to stand. Seeing that his command was not obeyed, he
                  leaped suddenly from his steed and rushed past the company sitting on the piazza
                  into the house. He had not gone far, when the entire company followed him along in
                  great haste and wonder.</p>
               <p>Captain Howe burst into the lighted parlor, and saw his fugitive standing and
                  trembling lest he should be discovered.</p>
               <p>"You are my prisoner!" exclaimed the Captain, advancing hastily and laying his
                  hand upon his shoulder.</p>
               <p>"To whom do I deliver my sword?" asked the prisoner, somewhat astonished to find
                  his captor so youthful a looking man.</p>
               <p>"To Captain Howe, of the 17th Regiment of the New Hampshire Brigade," replied the
                  Captain.</p>
               <p>The prisoner immediately drew his sword from its scabbard, and presented its hilt
                  to Captain Howe. The latter took it, and returned it to him again, saying.</p>
               <p>"From whom do I receive it?"</p>
               <p>"From Major Templeton!" was the reply, "of the 54th King's Regiment,"</p>
               <p>Captain Howe turned himself partially round, and saw that the room was filled with
                  those to whom the premises more properly belonged; and bowing slightly to the
                  gentleman, remarked to him,</p>
               <p>"I hope you will excuse my seeming rudeness, sir! It is one of the unpleasant
                  conditions of war, that even those who would enjoy peace by themselves are too apt
                  to be robbed of it without any warning. I have been in pursuit of the officer who
                  has just surrendered himself to my command, and thought of nothing but his
                  capture. I beg that you will pardon me, ladies, and you too, sir, for my
                  unmannerly interruption to-night. Be assured that you shall be annoyed by us no
                  longer than may be necessary for us to prepare for a safe retreat."</p>
               <p>The gentleman was about to reply to this very frank and courteous apology of the
                  young officer, when the ears of the latter were saluted by the tones of a voice he
                  knew full well,</p>
               <p>"Is it he? It is! Yesâ€”it is! it is he!"</p>
               <p>He looked in the direction whence the voice came, and descried the form of a
                  female entering at the door from the hall. She was clad in a flowing robe of
                  white, and her appearance was as that of a sylph. The dark plaits of her profuse
                  hair contrasted superbly with the pure white of her dress, while her face was
                  crimson with a sudden excitement, of which none knew the cause.</p>
               <p>"It is! It is William!" exclaimed she, advancing toward him.</p>
               <p>"Mary! My own Mary! Have I found you again! Blessed be God for this favor!"
                  replied he, with deep and almost unutterable emotion, while he rushed forward to
                  meet his own betrothed, and folded her closely in his arms.</p>
               <p>The reader already knows that this was the residence of Mr. Wilson, and that the
                  gentleman to whom Captain Howe had proffered the apology for his rude
                  interruption, was no other than Mr. Wilson himself.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Wilson and the ladies saw this unexpected scene between Mary and the
                  American officer, they were overwhelmed with astonishment. Ellen, it is true, had
                  some intimation of the person on whom Mary's love had centered, and while she
                  witnessed this ebullition of feeling or the part of her companion, her heart beat
                  more hastily, and her cheeks became flaming red. She gazed, too, at the form of
                  the young man with a feeling of admiration. There was that in his figure, his
                  carriage, his manner, that delighted herâ€”uniting grace and true manliness as he
                  did in every particular. And while he pressed Mary closer to his heart, and
                  blessed God that he had been allowed to meet her again. Ellen could not find it in
                  her heart to wonder that the girl was so much carried away with such a lover.</p>
               <p>The embrace of the delightful couple was long and ardent. As soon as Mary could
                  recover herself sufficiently from her excitement, she turned to Mr. Wilson, and,
                  looking up at him through her tearsâ€”they were but tears of joyâ€”she said.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Wilson, this is Captain Howe!"</p>
               <p>She could say no more.</p>
               <p>The Captain at once offered his hand to Mr. Wilson, grasping his warmly, and a
                  second time going through an apology for his intrusion there that evening;
                  although, he added, he could not but rejoice at the unlooked for event that had
                  brought him there. Major Templeton sullenly and silently withdrew to a seat in the
                  farther corner of the room, of whom no one took any notice. Once or twice Mr.
                  Wilson glanced at him, but it was plain that he intended to take no notice of him.
                  He had already had him in his house before, and entertained him under altogether
                  different circumstances. He would even now have thrust him violently from his
                  house, save for the reason that he was in the keeping of Captain Howe.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Wilson," remarked the Captain, "I think I once met you under entirely
                  different circumstances."</p>
               <p>"When? Where?" asked Mr. Wilson.</p>
               <p>"Do you remember the night, a couple of years ago, when your house was surrounded,
                  and several<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6939-00000051"/> British officers made
                  prisoners?" asked Capt. Howe, in reply.</p>
               <p>"Perfectly well, sir! Perfectly well! The prisoner you have taken to-night was
                  here; but he succeeded in making his escape before you entered the house."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible?" exclaimed Captain Howe, while the eyes of Miss Alice stole
                  scornfully in the direction of the silent captive. "Do you furthermore remember,"
                  continued he, "that you begged that you might return to the house, for your
                  daughter was in a critical situation?"</p>
               <p>"Very well, sir; but pray tell me, were you of that party?"</p>
               <p>"I was the <emph>commander</emph> of that party," replied Captain Howe.</p>
               <p>"Then I thank you again, and again, for your kindness!" exclaimed Mr. Wilson.
                     "<emph>You</emph> the man! I couldn't have believed it! But stranger things
                  than that have happened in this long war!"</p>
               <p>As he spoke, he again seized the hand of the young man, and, lending him to Miss
                  Alice, said:</p>
               <p>"This is my daughter Alice, sir!â€”the same whom your generous forbearance toward me
                  helped to save. She will thank you for it more deeply than I can And this is my
                  other daughterâ€”Miss Ellen," said he, turning to the little hunchback, who had
                  already found her way to the side of her dear friend Mary. "And <emph>this</emph>
                  one," added he, looking at the overjoyed Mary, "you seem to have become acquainted
                  with elsewhere, and at some long gone time!" Then he introduced him to the
                  housekeeperâ€”his sisterâ€”who, he said, had it in her power to make any guest
                  comfortable and happy, who was predisposed to such a state of feeling.</p>
               <p>As soon as these formalities were gone through, and the ladies had found
                  themselves seatsâ€”Mary and Ellen upon the sofaâ€”there was heard the sound of human
                  feet up the walk and upon the piazza. Mr. Wilson instantly hastened to the door,
                  and saw three men bearing along the body of a fourth. He had not time to retreat,
                  or even to ask them what was the matter, when one of them called out:</p>
               <p>"Help! For God's sake, help! Save a dying man!"</p>
               <p>"Quickâ€”quick, then!" cried out Mr. Wilson, in a frenzy of excitement. "Bring him
                  in this way! This way!"</p>
               <p>The voices alarmed those within, and while no one of the ladies dared to go to the
                  door for fear, and Captain Howe dared not leave the presence of his prisoner for
                  caution, the noise kept growing louder on the piazza, and then it was heard in the
                  hall.</p>
               <p>"This way!" said Mr. Wilson, throwing open the door of the parlor, and beckoning
                  them in. "There are ladies in here who may be able to do something for him!"</p>
               <p>As he spoke, the door opened, and the three men entered, supporting the body of
                  the fourth. They at once stretched him out upon the floor, and fell to rubbing
                  him. Captain Howe touched one of the men, bidding him look well to his prisoner in
                  the corner. Obedient to his order, the man rose from the floor, and went and sat
                  down by the side of the sorely strickened and deeply humiliated Major Templeton.
                  Captain Howe, as soon as he bent down over the body of the man just brought in,
                  saw who it was. He knew at but a single glance that it wasâ€”Verd-Antique!</p>
               <p>He had not been killedâ€”he was only wounded by some sudden and fearful blow. He lay
                  insensible, yet faintly breathing.</p>
               <p>"Bring some restoratives!" said Captain Howe.</p>
               <p>At that moment Mrs. Flood entered the door, attracted thither by the sound of
                  voices.</p>
               <p>"What do you want?" asked she looking only at the prostrate body, and not daring
                  to look about the room already full. "Restoratives, do you want?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes! Be quick! He needs help the most now! His life is worth a dozen common
                  lives to his country! Be quick as you can!"</p>
               <p>"There's an old woman come to my house this eveningâ€”just at duskâ€”and I know she's
                  a nurse, she's had so much to say about herbs and bruises! Let me go and get her!
                  She'll do as well, perhaps, as any doctor!" and she flew out of the room to go
                  after her.</p>
               <p>Knowing that some immediate application was of the greater need, Miss Wilson, the
                  sister and housekeeper, ran for brandy and other cordials, while the young ladies
                  with Mr. Wilson began looking round in every other direction for something else
                  that might be of service. It was not long before application of the medicines
                  found was made to the insensible man, and he appeared relieved. His breathing was
                  freer and more easy. He tossed one of his hands out, too as if he craved the
                  assistance of just such friends as were at that moment around him. By the time
                  that Mrs. Flood returned with the old woman who was her guest for the night, the
                  injured man was evidently in a fair way of recovery.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Flood entered again bringing the stranger with her. There was so much
                  confusion in the room that no one noticed her at first. She immediately bent down
                  over the body, muttered a few unintelligible syllable to herself, and said:</p>
               <p>"When he recovers a little moreâ€”some hot cordial, and soak his feet in hot water,
                  and bathe his temples! Mind and keep <emph>them</emph> well wetted!"</p>
               <p>She stood on her feet again, after examining the man's pulse, and gazed about the
                  room. There had been such an unwonted confusion before and around her, that it
                  took her a moment or two to recover herself. When at length she did, she directed
                  her attention most naturally to the young ladies first. Her keen eyes glanced over
                  their countenances, and quicker than thought almost, she stepped out before her,
                  exclaiming, while she threw up her shrivelled handsâ€”</p>
               <p>"Mary! Mary!"</p>
               <p>The girl truly had found her grandmotherâ€”old Bet Miffles! She reached out both
                  hands, while she still sat on the sofa, and responded in a faint voice:</p>
               <p>"Grandmother! How did you find me?"</p>
               <p>Captain Howe, who had temporarily gone out of doors to take a survey of what might
                  be going on, at at this moment came in again. Bet Miffles saw him and at once
                  broke out withâ€”</p>
               <p>"I have found her at last! Think not, William Howe, that you can carry her off and
                  hide her from me!"</p>
               <p>"I have done no such thing!" replied the astonished young man, wondering where she
                  could have come from at that time. "I have done no such thing. You girl was
                  carried away by other hands than mine!"</p>
               <p>"Yesâ€”yes'" added Mary</p>
               <p>The old witch stood stupified.</p>
               <p>"If you will hear me," continued Captain Howe, "I will tell you the whole in a few
                  words. The men who carried her away from you were Jim Marshallâ€”the infamous
                  outlawâ€”and the Indian Lariko!"</p>
               <p>"How know you? How know you?" quickly demanded she.</p>
               <p>The Indian is deadâ€”and so is the outlawâ€”"</p>
               <p>"Both dead!" exclaimed the old woman and Mary together.</p>
               <p>"Yes. The Indian was driven to the verge of the precipice before your hut, and
                  took his last plunge into the water below. The other one, Jim Marshall, was but
                  lately hung in camp for the crime of murder. He died as all such characters die.
                  Only the night before he was to be executed, he sent to me, wishing to see me. I
                  complied with his request and visited him in his confinement. At that time he
                  confessed to me the part he had taken in the forcible abduction of Mary, and
                  prayed that I would forgive him."</p>
               <p>"You!" interrupted the old woman.</p>
               <p>"Yes: and he begged me to spare no labor in finding Mary, and securing
                     <emph>her</emph> forgiveness for him, too. He then said he should die
                  comparatively happy. If I would not promise him this, he said he should not rest
                  easy in his graveâ€”if he was allowed one for his despised body. I promised to do
                  all he asked me; but little did I think, when I made him that promise, that I
                  should so soon be able to state the matter truly to Mary, or even to you! God has
                  been good indeed, that I have found Mary so soon!â€”that <emph>you</emph> have found
                  her, too!"</p>
               <p>The old witch stood mute under the influence of the words, although it was easy to
                  see that she was inwardly struggling with contending emotions. Those in the room
                  were deeply interested spectators in what they saw.</p>
               <p>"Can you take care of this man to-night, Mr. Wilson, and have no report of his
                  being here spread over the neighborhood?" asked Captain Howe. "I fear it may be
                  asking too much, sir, but he may himself one day be able to renumerate you in
                  quite as serviceable a way"</p>
               <p>"You are at liberty to do all you will, Captain," said Mr. Wilson, "that is
                  calculated to restore so good a friend to you again. He may, too, be better in the
                  morningâ€”very much better.</p>
               <p>"So I think," replied Captain Howe. "With this permission, then, I will take my
                  prisoner back with me. My men undoubtedly await me at this moment"</p>
               <p>As he spoke, a couple of men opened the door. They belonged to his company, and,
                  seeing his horse at the door, knew he must be within.</p>
               <p>"Tell them I will be back shortly!" said he to them, anxious to make the confusion
                  for Mr. Wilson's family not any greater. "How many prisoners have you taken?"</p>
               <p>"Full a dozen, Captain," was the reply, as they turned and hurried back to their
                  comrades.</p>
               <p>"Major Templeton!" said Captain Howe, advancing towards him.</p>
               <p>The old witch at once caught the words, and appeared wonderfully excited.</p>
               <p>"Are you ready to accompany me?" added the young Captain, in his pleasant
                  tone.</p>
               <p>The curiosity and excitement of the old woman being not in the least abated, she
                  advanced within three or four steps of him, and looked wildly in his face.</p>
               <p>"Is he a British officer, Captain Howe?" inquired she, looking with a deep anxiety
                  into his face.</p>
               <p>"He is," answered Captain Howe.</p>
               <p>"And Major Templeton?" continued she.</p>
               <p>The Captain bowed an affirmative.</p>
               <p>"Yesâ€”yesâ€”yes!" shrieked she, in a cracked and harsh voice, advancing still nearer
                  him and glaring fiercely in his face. He stood the ordeal tolerably well, although
                  he could not but feel mortified beyond common endurance by the gaze of the entire
                  assembly.</p>
               <p>"I know that face <emph>well</emph>â€”ay, those features,â€”those eyes,â€”eh!
                     <emph>hellish</emph> eyes! I know him <emph>well</emph>â€”too well! Major
                  Templeton, indeed! Have you followed me <emph>here</emph> then? Shall you
                     <emph>always</emph> be on my track!"</p>
               <p>Every one in the room stood confused beyond expression to be witnesses of such a
                  scene. From the incoherency of her manner, Mr. Wilson thought she might be insane,
                  and was about to interfere to prevent any further excitement. But Captain Howe
                  just then demanded of her what she meant by her conduct.</p>
               <p>"What do I <emph>mean!</emph>" answered she, shrieking it out more loud and
                  excitedly than ever,â€”"what do I <emph>mean!</emph> I mean that nigh upon twenty
                  years ago, that man stole away the affections of my daughter from me,â€”my only
                  child! I mean," continued she, waving her skeleton hand back and forth in his
                  face,â€”"I mean that after he got her affections, and got her to promise him
                  everything, <emph>he ruined her!</emph> Then he cruelly deserted herâ€”cruelly,
                     <emph>wickedly!</emph> He is a villain before you! I know him for such! I
                  remember him well! Major Templeton! <emph>speak,</emph> if such be not your
                  character! My poorâ€”poor girl! For years I followed on in pursuit of her, for she
                  had left me for very shame,<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6939-00000052"/> and summer
                  and winter I waited and watched for any tidings of her! And she has not come yet!
                  no, not yet!â€”and I never expect to see her again in this world! Oh, that I had the
                  power to punish such a villain as I would!"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Flood stood bewildered at the conduct of the woman whom she had introduced to
                  Mr. Wilson's house. When, however, her words felt on her ear, her eyes seemed
                  suddenly opened. She rushed toward the old woman, crying, as she did soâ€”</p>
               <p>"Mother! my own mother!"</p>
               <p>"What! what means allâ€”â€”" the old witch was about to utter.</p>
               <p>"Your own child! Behold your penitent Margaret!" said Mrs. Flood, her eyes
                  dropping hot tears.</p>
               <p>"Do my eyes deceive me? Am I not mistaken? Is this all a reality?" asked the
                  astonished old woman.</p>
               <p>"Mother' oh, mother! If you can but forgive me! That man was my destroyerâ€”but I am
                  saved now! I again behold my mother!"</p>
               <p>So unaccustomed had the old woman become, during a long course of dreary years, to
                  be influenced or affected by such scenes, that she was unable to discover any of
                  those deep and strong emotions that really dwelt in her breast. She shed no tears,
                  there foreâ€”not even tears of joy. For years she had shed none at all. Seizing hold
                  of her overwhelmed daughter, she, with the help of the other ladies, which they
                  now proflered, conducted her to the sofa, and they sat down together.</p>
               <p>There ensued a pause of a few minutes, after which, Captain Howe remarked that he
                  should be obliged to break up the interview which had resulted so strangely.</p>
               <p>"Stay!" cried out the old witch, rising to her feet and placing herself in his
                  way. "I have more to tell you! More that will interest you, and your prisoner,
                  too!"</p>
               <p>"What?" asked the young officer, anxious to remove his prisoner to a place of more
                  undoubted security. "I must begone soon; my men wait upon the road now; besides,
                  there's a sick one to be taken care of!"</p>
               <p>"Let me tell you<emph>nowâ€”now!</emph> It will not do to wait! You have said to me
                  that Mary is not my grand childâ€”she is not!"</p>
               <p>"What! I said so! I always said so!" exclaimed he.</p>
               <p>"She is the child of Major Templeton!" cried the witch. "When my Margaret left me
                  because of her shame I vowed that I would have my revenge as soon as I could upon
                  the man who had done my child such a wrong!"</p>
               <p>"And youâ€”"</p>
               <p>"I waited. He married, as I <emph>knew</emph> he would! But it was a wealthy lady
                  whom he marriedâ€”<emph>never</emph> thought he to have the poor, frail creature
                  whom he betrayed! When this child was born to him, I stole it from his roof and
                  fled!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, my God! My God!" exclaimed the agonized prisoner, pressing his hand to his
                  forehead. "Is this then my child? Do I see my own child? Come here, my Mary! Let
                  me look into those eyes again, which I have never seen since you were a child!
                  Come to me, my Mary!"</p>
               <p>"I swore,' continued the old woman, "that if <emph>my</emph> child was ever
                  restored to <emph>me, his</emph> should be restored to <emph>him</emph>â€”if I could
                  have it done! Thank Godâ€”it has been done this very night! Take back your child,
                  sir! She is yoursâ€”all your own! I own that I love her; but not as a mother may
                  love her own child! Take her to your bosom again, and thank God for the gift! She
                  is a sweet child, and you are her unworthy father!"</p>
               <p>Both Mary and her father wept tears of joy and sorrowâ€”of joy at such a re
                  unionâ€”sorrow, at the parent's deserved shame; a shame which he had wrought for
                  himself with his own hands!</p>
               <p>Then the old witchâ€”now no longer a witch, but the old Mrs. Mayâ€”fell to caressing
                  her daughter, and lavishing upon her such expressions of joy as she could command.
                  The daughter, however, was more affected with the meeting than was the mother. At
                  least, she showed the evidences of it to those around her.</p>
               <p>While this was the situation of affairs, who should enter at the door but Tim
                  Floodâ€”the reputed lunatic.</p>
               <p>"Aha! I've come just in time to see my sister again, havn't I, mother?" exclaimed
                  he, glancing at his mother and at the graceful figure of Mary, now standing by the
                  side of her father. "My pretty sister! I always loved her, from the time she first
                  came here! But what is this? Dead!â€”is he dead?" he asked, pointing at the
                  prostrate form of Verd Antique. "Dead? Noâ€”noâ€”noâ€”noâ€”! There's no death there! He'll
                  get well! He's only sick!"</p>
               <p>The situation of Mr. Wilson and his entire family was certainly peculiar. The
                  ladies could do nothing; they had no power to alleviate any sorrows, or to
                  heighten any of the joys of that strange occasion. It was left for them to look
                  on, and wonder at the marvellous changes that this mutable world is constantly
                  working in human affairs. They sympathized deeply for Major Templeton, even though
                  they despised him at the same time. Even Miss Alice could not refuse from her
                  heart to feel a deep pity for the man had so long played a false part to himself,
                  thinking that the <emph>world</emph> might possibly be deceived!</p>
               <p>Young Captain Howe was, of all others, however, in the most unwelcome predicament.
                  His soldier's heart was divided between love and duty. He felt the sting in being
                  obliged to carry away the father of his own betrothed, a captiveâ€”yet it had got to
                  borne by him. Rather than separate father and child, he went out to meet his men
                  and ordered them to encamp near the mansion of Mr. Wilson for that night and thus
                  were the long estranged parents and children able to pour out to each other the
                  feelings that had been dammed up in their breasts so long.</p>
               <p>Mrs. May went to her daughter's cot with her and her melancholy wreck of a
                  sonâ€”that sad evidence of the poor young mother's shame. Capt. Howe had it not in
                  his heart to separate Major Templeton from his daughter, and they all three sat up
                  late that night, forming better and more enduring acquaintance one with another.
                  Before they separated for the night, Major Templeton had freely given away his
                  daughter to her brave lover and defender, and he had accepted the gift with a
                  heart overflowing with gratitude.</p>
               <p>Verd-Antique was also removed to a cot in one of the chambers, where he received
                  every such attention from the entire family as would tend to reinvigorate him and
                  make him comfortable again.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXI.</head>
               <head type="sub">CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>AS early as was practicable on the ensuing morning, they all sallied forth from
                  the house of Mr. Wilson. Anxious to remove Mary to a place of greater safety,
                  Captain Howe had prevailed upon Mr. Wilson to send along his small carriage with
                  Mary and her father, while his company of soldiers formed the escort.</p>
               <p>The parting between the sisters and Mary, was touching in the extreme. They had
                  had her so long in their midst, that they parted with her with quite as much
                  reluctance as if she had been one of their own family. They loaded her with
                  blessings and presents, and prayed that she might long be spared, a source of
                  happiness to one every way so generous and brave as Captain Howe. They
                  consentedâ€”more from regard for Mary's feelings than anything elseâ€”to wish her
                  father a pleasant journey, wherever it might be his fortune to go: and Mr. Wilson
                  refused not to join his daughters in the expression of so proper and respectful a
                  wish. The body of men closed about the vehicle, and the entire cavalcade passed on
                  to the northward, hastening now to reach the head quarters of General Putnam.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner was brought into the presence of the General, together with the
                  ten or dozen others whom the men had taken, he ordered him, at Captain Howe's
                  private suggestion, into the country, promising the latter officer that if he
                  would engage to keep him properly guarded, he might retire with him, under a
                  proper escort, to the residence of his uncle, in the little village near
                  Ridgefield Mountain. Verd Antique having been able to come along with the body,
                  too, he offered Captain Howe his constant services as sentinel over the prisoner,
                  thinking moreover that his health would be greatly re-established thereby.
                  Accordingly, the arrangement being fully understood, while Captain Howe dismissed
                  Mr. Wilson's carriage to its owner again, he started with such conveyances as he
                  could procure for the residence of his uncleâ€”himself privileged with a whole
                  month's furlough, for the good service he had just performed. When old General
                  Putnam dismissed the two lovers from head quarters, sagaciously understanding what
                  must be the sweet relation subsisting between them. he blessed them with one of
                  his fervent blessings, and trusted from his heart that the young lady would live
                  many years to make <emph>some one</emph> happy!"</p>
               <p>That was the last campaign in our Revolutionary war that General Putnam went
                  throughâ€”the campaign of 1779. While posted during the whole of that spring and
                  summer near West Point, it was assigned him to supervise the construction and
                  fortification of the works at that placeâ€”the place he had himself selected as the
                  strongest point upon the Hudson.</p>
               <p>When, late in the fall, the army left the field and retired into winter quarters
                  at Morristown, General Putnam went for a few weeks into Connecticut, where his
                  family resided. After having finished his visit in the bosom of that family, he
                  commenced his journey by land to Morristown, by way of Hartford while upon the
                  road between Pomfret and Hartford he felt the torpor that precedes paralysis
                  creeping slowly over his right hand and foot. The numbness increased, until he had
                  lost the entire use of his limbs on that side of his body. Unwilling to believe
                  his disorder was what his friends too truly knew it to be, he made increased and
                  constant exertions to shake it off from him; but this he found to be impossible.
                  His reason and philosophy united soon to reconcile him to his fate.</p>
               <p>Though he had thus partially lost the use of his body, yet he never ceased to
                  enjoy the full vigor of his mind under this infliction. His memory continued sound
                  and retentive. His relish for domestic and social enjoyments was as keen as it had
                  ever been. And, in truth, all his faculties still remained to him unimpaired.
                  While still confined in his retreat at his fireside, and upon his farm, he heard
                  the noise of the conflict and longed to be a patriot soldier again; but it was
                  ordered that he rest now from his almost superhuman efforts, and live in
                  retirement to witness the glorious result of that contest upon which he entered at
                  the first with such zeal and courage. A single extract of a letter to him from
                  Washington, while he was thus living in peaceful retirement, will best give the
                  estimate in which he was held by the great commander of our armies at that
                  eventful day:â€”</p>

               <p>On the 17th day of May, 1790, General Putnam was attacked with a violent
                  inflammatory disease, which, from the first, he was satisfied would prove fatal.
                  "Calm and resigned," says Col. Humphreys, his friend and biographer, "he awaited
                  the approach of death with joy, as a messenger sent to call him from a life of
                  toil to everlasting rest." On the 19th, he ended a life which had been spent in
                  cultivating and defending the soil of his birth. As the Clergyman who delivered
                  the eulogium over his remains said, "He pitied littlenessâ€”loved goodnessâ€”admired
                  greatness, and ever aspired to its glorious summit! The friend, the servant, and
                  almost unparalleled lover of his countryâ€”worn with honorable age and the former
                  toils of warâ€”PUTNAM 'rests from his labors!'"</p>
               <p>On the 21st of May he was buried. His tombstone still remains in the churchyard of
                  the quiet little hamlet where he yielded up his breath, and upon it is the
                  following inscription, written by the esteemed President Dwight, of Yale College,
                  who knew the old hero intimately, from an army acquaintanceship:â€” <q>
                     <p>Sacred be this Monument<lb/> to the memory<lb/> of<lb/> ISRAEL PUTNAM,

                        ever attentive<lb/> to the lives and happiness of his men,<lb/> dared to
                        lead<lb/> where any dared to follow;<lb/> if a Patriot,<lb/> remember the
                        distinguished and gallant services<lb/> rendered thy country<lb/> by the

                        who<lb/> raised himself to universal esteem,<lb/> and offices of eminent
                        distinction,<lb/> by personal worth<lb/> and a<lb/> useful life.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The old hero sleeps undisturbed.</p>
               <p>After the war was ended, the General received a letter from Captainâ€”afterwards
                  Colonelâ€”Howe, inviting him to attend upon the ceremony which was to unite him to
                  the maiden he had lover so long and so wellâ€”Mary Templeton; but the health of his
                  old comrade was too much impaired to admit of such a journey, and he returned them
                  his heartfelt thanks for his kind and thoughtful invitation, while he craved
                  innumerable blessings on the heads of those about to enter on the new relation.
                  The wedding came off at the house of the young officer's uncle, and immediately a
                  trip was made by the newly married couple and Major Templeton to England. The
                  former returned not long after, and settled themselves down in the place of their
                  beneficent, gouty uncle, which he had just before vacated by death.</p>
               <p>Bet Miffies, the old witch, returned, not long after finding her daughter, to New
                  York, whence they found an early opportunity to embark in a transport ship for
                  Englandâ€”her native land Tim Flood accompanied them also, perhaps less a lunatic
                  each year than ever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilson and his interesting family continued to live in their old place, where,
                  not long after the close of the war, Alice married a merchant of the city. Ellen
                  remained to her aunt and father, the same hunchback, and the same angel of
                  goodness she had ever been. Her intercourse with Mary Templeton was long and
                  steadily kept up, greatly to the happiness of both.</p>
               <p>Buff continued to make Col. Howe a faithful servantâ€”just as he had been for his
                  uncle before him. The Colonel and his beautiful wife occasionally ramble up the
                  mountain height to visit the ruins of the old but, and reflect upon the change
                  that a few years wrought in each of them. Buff used to stand and gaze at the cabin
                  in which Mary was once confined by the Tory and the Indian, and to wish that he
                  could but have had a hand in the punishment of the infamous wretches.</p>
               <p>When the war was ended, the father of Laura Edwards saw matters with different
                  eyes, and changed the hue of his politics. After that date, it was nothing
                  difficult for Captain Byram to visit frequently at his house, and finally marry
                  his daughter; yet both agreed that Henry's agency in placing Mr. Edwards in the
                  guard-house should never be disclosed to him on any condition or pretext.</p>
               <p>Paul Potter continued the landlord of the "Eel Pot," and Verd-Antique, now that he
                  was much worn with the toils of war, assisted him in his business, after the style
                  of a partnership. The old tavern haunt still stands in the city, and there be many
                  who enter its door, regardless of the many strange histories that might be read
                  upon its inner walls, and ignorant of the important part it bore in the trying
                  days of the Revolution.</p>

            <p>BY G. W. M. REYNOLDS,</p>
            <p>Author of 'The MYSTERIES of the COURT of LONDON,' 'KENNETH,' 'COURT of NAPLES,'
               &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The immense sale of this deeply-interesting work fully proves the hold it has taken
               on popular favor. It is inded one of the most fascinating novels that has recently
               been published, and exhibits the trials, the light and dark shades of a
               servant-maid's life, in a manner at once powerful, and such as to absorb the intense
               interest of the reader. It is in fact a domestic mirror, in which the reader will
               behold, depicted with truth, all kinds of masters and mistresses of families, and the
               many good and evil ways in which households can be managed. It is one of Reynolds'
               best efforts.â€”<title>The Times.</title>

            <head>EVELEEN WILSON,</head>
            <head type="sub">OR THE TRIALS OF AN ORPHAN GIRL.</head>
            <p>THIS is a thrilling and interesting narrative of facts, which, startling as they may
               appear, have actually occurred within the last few years. Few can read the story
               without feeling deeply interested in the career of the noble-minded, but
               sorely-tempted EVELEEN. We do not recollect ever having read a work more calculated
               to rivet the attention. The reader feels himself one of the series of characters, and
               watches the fortunes of the heroine, and rejoices in her eventual success and her
               triumph over her enemies, as though she were an intimate friend or a beloved
               relative.</p>
