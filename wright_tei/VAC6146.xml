            <head>PROLOGUE.</head>
            <head type="sub">BY THE AUTHOR OF THE ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>"IN the golden sunshine of the budding spring, on the porch of my old country house,
               I sit and gaze at the waving foliage, and think 't is not time lost to fall into a
               reverie, as it were into a dream, of other days, and the noble figures which
               illustrated and adorned them.</p>
            <p>"The sun of May is shining on the flowery lawn, where the yellow buttercups and
               velvet grass are stirred by the warm south wind; the belt of forest makes a rich
               green background to the fields and streams; and bright like the flowers, dancing like
               the brook, my little girl, with eyes 'as azure as the heavens,' and sunny hair,
               chases the earliest butterflies across the sward, and with her presence adds the
               finishing grace to the mellow landscape of spring.</p>
            <p>"So I sit, and smile, and dream; then I think, with a sigh, that a few decades may
               change, and even wholly obliterate, this rural beauty, this smiling ease and repose.
               Little Kate may be called to heaven, or out into the wide, wide world—my form will
               assuredly be laid in earth—the old homestead probably will pass from my race—and
               those who knew and loved us, know us no more. Why not? Is it not, after all, the
               common story? Where are now all those brilliant scenes and figures of the elder
               Virginia, glimmering faintly through the mists of scarce fourscore years? Where are
               the men and manners of the days of the Revolution, only hinted at obscurely in what
               the world calls histories? Do they exist for us to-day, except as names and
               traditions? And what does the present generation know of them?</p>
            <p>"Alas for the historians! They tell us many things, but so little!<pb n="viii-ix"
                  xml:id="VAC6146-00000005"/> They relate, with much dignity, how the battle was
               fought and the treaty made—they tell us the number of the combatants, and spread
               every protocol upon the page. But the student of the past asks for more. Of the
               historian we ask a picture of the elder day—portraits of the Virginian and his
               household. We would know the peculiarities of character and manner which marked a
               great race—the worthies of Virginia. We would live again, for a time, beneath those
               fair or storm-convulsed skies of 'Old Virginia;' we would take the hand of the honest
               old planter; we would go into his library, and look over his shoulder as he reads the
               new Act in the 'Virginia Gazette,' and would not disdain to scan critically the
               powdered curls and looped-back gowns, the flounces, and furbelows, and fancies of the
               dames.</p>
            <p>"We would see the rude Old-Field School on the edge of the forest, and listen to the
               words, and watch the bright faces of those children who will make hardy patriots and
               devoted women. We would accompany, in the fine chariot, Myrtilla, or Florella, as she
               goes to the assembly, decked in satins, and laces, and towers of curls; and see
               Damon, or Strephon, dance the minuet opposite to her, with his cocked hat pressed
               upon his heart. We would accompany the squire in his coach and four, to the county
               court, where he sits in awful state, with his brother justices of the peace; or to
               church, where the good parson delivers the evangel of grace, from the tub-shaped
               pulpit. We would hear the buzz of the crowd on the race course, or at the cockfight,
               and listen to their discussions of the doings of Parliament, and the speed of the
               favorite racer. We would look in at the window of the old Raleigh Tavern, and read
               what the company assembled in the Apollo Room are doing in spite of his Excellency
               and his stern 'You are accordingly dissolved!' In a word, we would look again on that
               vigorous race, that singular society; see the tragedy and the comedy—hear the sighs
               and the laughter. We would see the lofty forms defile before us, slowly, in a long,
               august line; we would hear the old voices, weigh every accent; and then we should
               know what the past was really—we should seize on the spirit of the Revolution.</p>
            <p>"That we should know what that Revolution really was, is a matter ter of the first
               importance to ourselves and our descendants. That we should trace its steps, divine
               its causes, and see the effect produced logically—this is what we ask the histories
               to assist us in. We ask it in vain. The historians have bloody minds and delight in
               carnage; or legal minds, and wander in the flowery fields of legislative enactments.
               In vain does the student rebel and turn away; he is told that what he wishes is
               beneath the dignity of history, and thus has it happened that we have nothing but the
               skeleton, when we want the warm blood, the flushed brows, and the flashing eyes.</p>
            <p>"I hear Kate laughing as I ponder so, and my spleen against the historians, as I
               listen to that cheerful music, disappears. My Kate scatters light, and love, and
               goodness wherever she goes, and her laughter is a purer music than the harp of Æolus.
               It tells me now that 'tis not my place to speak ill of the historians—that, after
               all, 't is a hard task I would impose upon them—a heavy burden I would place upon
               their shoulders. To revive a whole period, or many periods, with all their
               peculiarities of life and thought and manners—to depict those joys and griefs, whose
               causes often shift and change in the long current of our human story—to live in the
               life, rejoice with the joy, and sympathize with the sorrow of a vanished race—thus
               bringing from the remote and misty shadow land, the actual figures, and
               reconstructing, from the shattered fragments, the statue, the moulding, and the
               inscription;—this is no child's play, rather a scourging toil, and if no one has
               accomplished it, we can scarcely complain.</p>
            <p>"So I make my peace again with the historians, and looking forth upon the sunlit
               fields, return in thought to an earlier epoch, remembering, with smiles, a boy whom I
               knew once on a time; a boy who said that he would one day fill the immense canvas
               with the thronging figures, and paint the great future of Virginia. He was young and
               ardent; he loved the noble past of his native land. That past stretched far away
               before him, like some land of Faëry, all sunlight, beauty and romance. The breath of
               a million flowers came on the winds, for ever blowing from the sea, and fanning
               tranquilly his boyish forehead. The green fields were ever bathed in golden dawns,<pb
                  n="x-xi" xml:id="VAC6146-00000006"/> or purple sunsets dying on the vast horizon,
               or the great blue canopy drooped over all like a dream. The stately rivers flowed
               through bright champaigns, mirroring those skies with all their snowy cloud ships;
               and the great forests waving their long plumes in the Atlantic breezes, ever
               resounded musical and joyous secrets.</p>
            <p>"This was the land in which had gone on—brave and hearty, illustrated by a thousand
               scenes as picturesque as they were significant—that strange, old, rude, poetical,
               colonial life.</p>
            <p>"The great mountains, too, stretched mighty arms toward the boy, and the immense
               belts of pines, crowding the steep precipices of the Alleghanies, spoke, like their
               low land brethren, of the things of the past. Here, in these solitary fastnesses, the
               borderer had struggled, breast to breast, with the savage; yonder, at the foot of
               that tree, the girl or the child was tomahawked, and left to bleed and die; those
               houses dotting the fair valley, from whose embowering foliage curl wreaths of snowy
               smoke, in the lazy atmosphere, were every one the scene of a tragedy or a comedy;
               they heard the broken sob of the weeping mother, or the wild and uproarious revelry
               of the borderers; their old walls are battered with balls, and the stockades show
               where the torch of the Indian was applied in the darkness, but quenched in his
               heart's blood by the rifle ball of the mountaineer. From the mouth of the Potomac to
               its source in the Alleghanies, along the banks of the beautiful Shenandoah, the
               'Daughter of the Stars, there was scarcely a spot which did not recall a tradition, a
               legend, or a history. All this did the youth I am thinking of dwell upon, and—well,
               well, here I am dreaming! It was only his folly, and I must think of my work.</p>
            <p>"I design composing a work of the revolutionary period, based on family archives. I
               shall begin with May of the year 74, when the trees commenced to bud, and the flowers
               to bloom, as if the thunder and lightning were not brooding upon the horizon, and the
               soil beginning to tremble. It was not long before the chasm yawned—indeed, a few
               months threw between the old days and the new, an impassable gulf. Upon one side of
               that gulf, now looking back, we discern the colonial <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                  >régime</foreign> of ease and tranquillity—the slow rolling coach, the
               aristocratic dignity, the machinery of class, and courtly ceremony. On the other
               side, the mortal struggle of the new era, the leveling republicanism, born of a
               common danger—the 'gentry,' and the 'commoners,' in leather harness, fighting side by
               side under their common father, and constructing a new world, 'mid storm and tempest,
               on the bloody battle-fields of the Revolution.</p>
            <p>"My work will aim to draw a few pictures of this period of transition, and I have
               ample material. When my dear and honored father died, he left me an old iron-bound
               trunk full of family letters, and in these venerable papers I find many histories.
               To-day it shall be the life of Henry St. John, Esquire, of 'Flower of Hundreds,' in
               Prince George, a gentleman connected with our house. Of Mr. St. John I have a
               miniature in the stiff old style, and very many letters in his own handwriting, which
               is rapid and careless, with a number addressed to him by others. The miniature
               presents the young man vividly to the eyes, with his olive cheeks, black hair, and
               clear, fixed look; the letters embrace much of the history of his early manhood. They
               allude to and describe, also, some public events which occurred at the period in
               Virginia, and speak of more than one eminent name, now the property of history.</p>
            <p>"I have read these letters again and again; I often linger over their pages with
               profound interest,—with smiles, or frowns, or deep feeling.</p>
            <p>"Yellow letters!—I say—which share with the moth-eaten doublets and rusty old
               broad-swords, the honor of reviving the past! Cracked miniature! in whose fading and
               age-dimmed outlines a face of other days shines so clearly! Old letters, old
               miniatures, old costumes, old swords, old ghostly reminiscences of ghostly 'cocked
               hats!' the historian salutes you with a low and respectful bow, for you speak of the
               Revolution. Yellow laces, too, in the chests up stairs—old pearls, and diamonds,
               breastpins and rings—he salutes you, too, for you speak of the fair dames, and to
               these he bows with his whole heart.</p>
            <p>In the beautiful May morning of the new century, he will write of you, with the old
               days shining in his memory, as it were, and the old faces looking down from the
               wainscoted walls.</p>

            <p>"They have diamonds in their ears, and pearls in their hair; they are covered with
               lace and embroidery,—the fair maidens and dames. The cavaliers are ruffled and
               powdered, and they smile—they smile, like the maidens, as their historian
               commences.</p>
            <p>"So I sit in the merry May sunshine and idly dream—summoning, from the dead, those
               gracious figures, before going to accomplish my design. Soon I will go; here, in my
               plain old Virginia country house, I will tell my plain old story.</p>
            <p>"Some day, doubtless, 't will be edited, and so sent forth to the world; but what
               matter if 't is not? I shall live again, as I write, in the beautiful past—the sound
               of those noble voices is my consolation.</p>

               <head type="sub">FLOWERS OF THE FOREST.</head>
               <p>IT is a beautiful May morning, in the year 1774.</p>
               <p>The sun is shining brightly, the oriole swings to and fro on his lofty spray, and
                  carols to the spring; the month of flowers has dawned upon the world in all its
                  loveliness, and scattered daisies, violets and buttercups on the green expanse of
                  smiling meadows, and along the grassy banks of streams.</p>
               <p>Two children holding each other by the hand, take their way through a forest
                  stretching to the west of Williams-burg, the old capital of Virginia.</p>
               <p>They are a boy and a girl, apparently about ten years of age.</p>
               <p>The boy is a gallant looking urchin, clad in a richly embroidered roundabout, drab
                  shorts, and gayly colored stockings, which disappear in high-quartered shoes,
                  ornamented with rosettes of ribbon; his curling hair, framing ruddy cheeks, is
                  surmounted by a little cocked hat with a jaunty feather.</p>
               <p>The girl's costume is in some points similar.</p>
               <p>She wears a sort of frock coat, so to speak, of pink "calimanco," opening in
                  front, and displaying a species of waist-coat, laced across a ruffled stomacher.
                  The frock falls only to the knees, where it is met by white silk stockings,
                     held<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6146-00000010"/> by velvet garters, ornamented
                  with clocks at the instep, and ending in small high-heeled shoes, with galoshes.
                  Her head, with its bright curls, is protected by a broad-rimmed chip hat, secured
                  with a blue ribbon tied beneath the chin.</p>
               <p>The boy is gay, mischievous, full of mirth and high spirits. The girl gentle,
                  sedate, with a pensive look in her mild eyes which peer out from a number of stray
                  ringlets. In one hand she carries a checker-work satchel, holding a few books—for
                  they are going to the old field school; in the other, a nosegay of violets and
                  sweet-briar roses, the gift of her cavalier, who disputes the possession of her
                  hand with the flowers.</p>
               <p>They soon come in sight of the old field school. It is a log building, with a
                  broad, well-barred door, a log for a step, a chimney of rough stone built outside,
                  and heavy oaken shutters on rusty hinges.</p>
               <p>The rude old building sleeps beneath the lofty oaks very tranquilly; but from the
                  interior comes a busy hum which indicates the presence of children.</p>
               <p>The girl looks anxiously toward one of the windows and says:</p>
               <p>"Oh me, Paul! See the sun on the shutter! We're <emph>very</emph> late, and I'm
                  afraid Uncle Jimmy'll keep us in!"</p>
               <p>"Let him!" replies Mr. Paul with great gallantry, "who cares? We've had a glorious
                  time getting flowers, Blossom; and I don't mind being kept in with
                     <emph>you.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Paul inserts one thumb into the arm-hole of his waistcoat as he speaks, and
                  bestows a devoted look upon his companion.</p>
               <p>"I don't mind myself," says Blossom, hurrying on, "but you love Prisoner's Base
                  so, Paul!—and then you came in time: for yonder is your pony tied to the oak, and
                  you'll be kept in, because you came to meet me."</p>
               <p>"Well, what if I did come?" says Paul, carelessly, "although you wouldn't let me
                  carry your satchel. Is Uncle Jimmy to ride roughshod over me for that? Can't a
                  Virginia ginia gentleman get flowers for a lady without being brought to
                  trial?"</p>
               <p>And Paul looks proud and indignant.</p>
               <p>"A lady, Paul!" says Blossom, with a low silvery laugh; "why I'm only a
                  child!"</p>
               <p>"You're my sweetheart."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw, Paul! what a goose you are! how foolish you do talk!"</p>
               <p>And Blossom turns away her head, hastening on towards the school-house. Paul gets
                  before her, however, and in a moment they are standing in presence of Uncle Jimmy
                  Doubleday, an old gentleman with a lengthy coat, huge goggles, splatterdashes, and
                  a gray queue, who presides over a crowd of boys and girls—all rosy cheeks, curls,
                  freckles and health—busy studying at the long desks against the walls.</p>
               <p>Uncle Jimmy has just inflicted condign punishment upon an urchin who was drawing
                  individuals in a boxing attitude upon his slate—the criminal having been posted in
                  a corner with the slate around his neck, and a huge dunce's cap upon his head.
                  Uncle Jimmy is therefore irate. He sternly demands of Paul and Blossom why they
                  are so late.</p>
               <p>Paul, who still holds his companion's hand, declares, with an easy air, that
                     <emph>he</emph> is the cause of it: he thought he'd carry Blossom off to get
                  some flowers.</p>
               <p>"Oh no, Uncle Jimmy!" says Blossom, with a timid look into the old schoolmaster's
                  face, "I was late before, and Paul is not to blame. Papa came home last night, and
                  I love to talk with him so much."</p>
               <p>At the word papa, Uncle Jimmy seems suddenly mollified.</p>
               <p>"Well, well," he says, looking through his great goggles at the child's face, and
                  trying not to smile, "well, Blossom, you are excused; you never do wrong
                  purposely, my child; and for your sake I excuse this youngster. But take care
                  sir!" added Uncle Jimmy, turning with a tremendous frown to the urchin, "take
                  care, in future, Mr. Paul Effingham! I<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6146-00000011"/>
                  make the prediction, that the birch destined for you, is growing."</p>
               <p>And Uncle Jimmy scowled ferociously at Paul, who sauntered with a jaunty air
                  toward his desk. For Paul was a favorite too.</p>
               <p>The old pedagogue fell into a reverie, caressed gently Blossom's hair, heaved a
                  sigh, and then awoke. Having vigorously applied the birch to a youngster who had
                  just made his neighbor execute a terrible leap, by sticking a pin into him, Uncle
                  Jimmy called the next class, and so the old field school went on its way as
                  usual.</p>
               <p>At last came "play time," and the old schoolmaster closed his books. To his
                  profound astonishment the girls and urchins did not move. Uncle Jimmy saw with
                  incredulous stupefaction that they did not snatch their hats with ardor, and rush
                  into the open air.</p>
               <p>The worthy pedagogue rubbed his eyes. Was he dreaming? Had he made a mistake and
                  forestalled the hour? No: there was the rustic dial consisting of a nail driven
                  into the window seat, whose shadow, when it ran along a certain line, marked noon;
                  and now the shadow plainly indicated twelve. Instead of rushing out, the boys and
                  girls had gathered around Blossom, and evidently desired to use her favor with the
                  pedagogue to obtain some boon.</p>
               <p>Blossom seemed to resist; but the eloquent advocates redoubled their entreaties,
                  and at last the girl approached the schoolmaster.</p>
               <p>"If you please, Uncle Jimmy," she said, timidly, "we want you to give us a holiday
                  to-day."</p>
               <p>"Holiday!" cried Uncle Jimmy, with a horrified expression, "holiday! On what
                  earthly ground?"</p>
               <p>Blossom was a little abashed by the loud exclamation, and faltered.</p>
               <p>"There, my child—there, Blossom," said Uncle Jimmy, "don't mind my outcry. I'm not
                  a little forest bird like you, that does nothing but cheep and twitter. I growl:
                  don't mind me; but say why you want a holiday. Can any one explain such an unusual
                  request?"</p>
               <p>And the pedagogue addressed himself with dignity to the crowd. He had cause to
                  regret the movement. A deafening explanation greeted his appeal, above whose
                  uproar were heard only the words, "They're coming! They're coming! They're
                  coming!"</p>
               <p>The schoolmaster closed his ears with horror; and then rising to his full height
                  upon the rostrum, extended both his hands in wrath above the youthful orators, and
                  cried—</p>
               <p>"Cease, ye young bulls of Bashan!—cease! Have you no regard for my ears, unhappy
                  reprobates that you are! Let Blossom speak, and hold your clatter, or I'll birch
                  every mother's son of you!"</p>
               <p>It seemed that even the little maidens were terrified by this address to the boys.
                  A deep silence followed, and Blossom having again urged the general request, Uncle
                  Jimmy did what he had never for a moment hesitated about—he gave the desired
                  holiday.</p>
               <p>"Go, go my children," he said, "yes, go and see the vain pageant of a poor mimic
                  royalty! You are not an old fellow like me; you are children, and love music, and
                  bells ringing, and fine dresses. Go see how gallant we can be in old Virginia when
                  we—pshaw! I'm not making an address! Go, children, and come early in the
                  morning."</p>
               <p>With these words Uncle Jimmy extended his hands paternally, and in a minute and a
                  half the old school-house was deserted.</p>
               <p>At the same moment the noise of chariots was heard upon the forest road in front
                  of the school-house—the rolling of wheels, and the sound of the hoofs of
                  horses.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <head type="sub">FLOWERS OF THE COURT.</head>
               <p>PAUL was hastening, with his arm around Blossom, toward the tree where his pony
                  Shag was tied—the young gentleman's design being to convey his sweetheart behind
                  him into Williamsburg—when suddenly both stopped, arrested by the appearance of a
                  brilliant cavalcade.</p>
               <p>It consisted of three richly decorated chariots, each drawn by six glossy horses,
                  and followed by plainer vehicles. The drivers and footmen who hung behind were
                  white English servants, as were the numerous outriders.</p>
               <p>The first equipage contained three ladies—the rest seemed occupied chiefly by
                  gentlemen.</p>
               <p>As the flock of children ran out to look upon the brilliant spectacle, the head of
                  a young lady was thrust from the window of the foremost coach, and she seemed to
                  be calling the attention of her companions to the children.</p>
               <p>It was a beautiful face, framed in bright curls, and looking very sweet and
                  good-humored.</p>
               <p>"Isn't she pretty, Paul?" said Blossom, in a whisper.</p>
               <p>"Uncommonly," returned Paul, with the air of a connoisseur; "but look, Blossom,
                  she is beckoning to you!"</p>
               <p>In fact, the pretty picture of the boy and girl, with their arms around each
                  other, had attracted the attention of the young lady, and taking advantage of a
                  momentary pause, occasioned by a portion of the harness becoming out of place, she
                  had really beckoned to the girl.</p>
               <p>Blossom approached the chariot, followed by Paul, and looked with timid grace into
                  the face of the young lady, who smiled sweetly, and gave her hand to each.</p>
               <p>"That is a school-house, is it not, my dear?" she said; "every thing is bright
                  here, and you and all look very happy."</p>
               <p>"That's because Blossom is so good, ma'am," said Paul politely; "everybody's happy
                  where she is."</p>
               <p>"Blossom," said the lady smiling, "is that your name?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am," returned the child, "and his is Paul."</p>
               <p>"Paul! do you hear, Susan?" said the young lady, turning one of her companions;
                  "what pretty names they have in Virginia—<emph>Blossom</emph> and
                     <emph>Paul!</emph> and you know we stopped last night at <emph>Roslyn
                     Hall.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Then turning to the children, the young lady added:</p>
               <p>"I wish you would come and see me, Blossom—and you too, Paul. My name is Augusta
                  Murray, and we are going to live in Williamsburg now."</p>
               <p>As she spoke, the footman again mounted behind, having fixed the harness, and the
                  young lady again gave her hand to the children, with a pleased smile.</p>
               <p>The cavalcade then resumed its way slowly.</p>
               <p>The flock of children, Blossom and Paul leading, surrounded and followed it, as a
                  triumphal escort, and it went thus attended toward the old capital.</p>
               <p>For many hours the good town of Williamsburg has been in commotion. An immense
                  crowd has assembled, and the waves of the multitude now extend from the college of
                  "William and Mary," past the old magazine, and the "Raleigh" tavern, quite onward
                  to the steps of the capitol, where, around the base of Lord Botetourt's statue,
                  the restless and variegated billows seem to break into foam and spray.</p>
               <p>All classes, all costumes are seen. Plain homespun clothes and rich doublets,
                  gentry and commoners, merchants and factors, and yeomen, and negroes, and a great
                  crowd of students from the college of "William and Mary," who flock in gay groups
                  along the thoroughfares, cracking jokes, like their brethren in all ages.</p>
               <p>"Duke-of-Gloucester-street" thus represents a jubilant carnival: it is a
                  conglomeration of forms, plain and picturesque, old and young, male and
                  female—jesting, laughing, shouting, jostling—awaiting the event of the day.</p>
               <p>From time to time the crowd moves to and fro unwillingly, and as it were under
                  protest; then rapidly divides itself<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6146-00000013"/> into
                  parallel columns on each side of the street; and through this space rolls a
                  chariot, with four glossy horses. It contains some old planter in his richest
                  pourpoint, with his wife and daughters blazing in silk and velvet and diamonds;
                  and the driver is a portly and consequential negro, who, proud of himself, his
                  master, and his position, looks down with aristocratic condescension on the "poor
                  white folks."</p>
               <p>As the chariot disappears in the direction of the palace of the Governor, some
                  richly clad gallant, mounted upon his gayly-caparisoned thorough-bred, prances by
                  in the same direction; and if he be handsome he occasions favorable remarks from
                  the damsels, whose heads are visible in the windows above.</p>
               <p>He is succeeded by some country cart of rude pine board, drawn by a solemn-looking
                  donkey; and as the old country-man and his wife bounce up and down, the heads at
                  the windows utter jests and laughter—a taste for the grotesque having
                  characterized the maidens of that epoch, as it does the damsels of to-day.</p>
               <p>With the uproarious crowd mingle members of the House of Burgesses, and many
                  personages who seem to look with a philosophic eye on the carnival. These do not
                  laugh or jest; they wait; they seek for the currents of popular opinion, and
                  continue to gaze silently.</p>
               <p>All at once, in the midst of the tumult, a bell is heard, and this is followed by
                  a shout.</p>
               <p>Then a great undulation takes place in the mass; the waves roll right and left,
                  young girls are precipitated into strangers' arms; through the open space comes on
                  a troop of horsemen from the direction of the palace—Lord Dunmore's guards, who
                  occupy barracks near at hand.</p>
               <p>They ride vigorous horses, and are clad in the British uniform, being, indeed,
                  Englishmen. They disappear at the western end of Gloucester street, followed by
                  some murmurs.</p>
               <p>The crowd closes after them; the bells continue to ring; the windows are more
                  densely crowded; urchins even mount upon the old Magazine, and clasp the
                  flag-staff bearing aloft the banner of St. George. A great shout tells that the
                  object of all this excitement has entered the capital.</p>
               <p>The confusion becomes now like Pandemonium. The heads of young girls are thrust to
                  a dangerous distance from the windows; handkerchiefs are violently waved by these
                  splendor-loving youthful personages; and the number of damsels, children, and all
                  weaker characters who are precipitated upon alien bosoms is more marked than
                  ever.</p>
               <p>But the end is accomplished; the center of the street is left free.</p>
               <p>A score of the guards, riding four abreast, precede the cavalcade which we have
                  seen stop a moment near the old field school. As many follow it.</p>
               <p>The first chariot contains the Countess of Dunmore, wife of his Excellency the
                  Governor, with her daughters the Ladies Susan and Augusta.</p>
               <p>The second is occupied by Lady Catherine and her brothers, the Honorable Alexander
                  and John Murray.</p>
               <p>The third contains Lord Fincastle, Captain Foy, the private secretary of his
                  Excellency, and his wife. Captain Foy looks forth calmly on the crowd—his pale,
                  quiet face betrays nothing.</p>
               <p>But the countess, her daughters and her sons, are plainly gratified by their
                  reception. The young ladies especially, with their rosy and good-humored faces,
                  seem far from indifferent to the shouts of welcome which greet them. They look out
                  and smile, and raise their eyes to the fair faces at the windows, or scan the
                  crowd.</p>
               <p>The crowd looks back amiably. It pays no attention to Lord Fincastle, Captain Foy,
                  or the sons of his Excellency. They are accustomed to lords and honorables, and
                  prefer the smiling faces of the young ladies.</p>
               <p>Thus the cortege passes along Gloucester street, accompanied by the crowd which
                  bears it on its way. The bells continue to ring—a band of music in the palace
                  grounds commences an inspiring march—the chariots enter the great<pb n="26-27"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000014"/> gateway, flanked as now by the two guard-houses—and
                  then the Scottish lindens hide them from the eyes of the multitude.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <head type="sub">HOW BLOSSOM FAINTED, AND WHAT FOLLOWED.</head>
               <p>THE crowd does not at once disperse. It busies itself looking at the chariots, at
                  the fat gentleman on the palace portico, at the musicians who blow away with
                  puffed cheeks.</p>
               <p>The strident music has a less pleasing effect upon the horses of the troop, who,
                  ranged on each side of the great gate, defend the passage against all but the
                  chariots of the "gentry."</p>
               <p>The animals move uneasily, threatening every moment to trample on the crowd, and
                  their riders are evidently as ill at ease.</p>
               <p>This sentiment seems experienced, more than all, by their commander.</p>
               <p>He is a young man of twenty-four or five, wearing a rich uniform, and a heavy
                  saber. He curbs with a vigorous hand his restive charger; his dark eyebrows are
                  knit into a heavy frown.</p>
               <p>More than once his animal has just escaped trampling on some member of the crowd
                  whose attention is attracted by the efforts he plainly makes to subdue the horse;
                  but the officer seems ill disposed to furnish an object for popular comment. His
                  patience all at once gives way—anger overcomes him—and striking the animal
                  violently on the head with his gauntleted hand, he mutters something very much
                  like an imprecation.</p>
               <p>The horse backs, then starts forward under the spur driven violently into his
                  side. At the same instant a cry beneath the very feet of the charger is heard, and
                  the young man sees that a child has fallen under the trampling hoofs.</p>
               <p>A score of hands are stretched out—as many exclamations heard—but the young
                  officer forestalls assistance. He throws himself from the saddle, and raising the
                  figure of the child in his arms, asks anxiously if she is hurt.</p>
               <p>"No sir—I believe—not," she falters. "I was a little frightened—I can stand—I
                  think, sir."</p>
               <p>And Blossom—for it is our little friend of the old field school, separated from
                  Paul by the crowd—Blossom glided from the encircling arm, and placed her feet upon
                  the ground.</p>
               <p>Had not the young man supported her again, she would have fallen. The frown
                  deepened on his face, and something like a growl issued from his lips.</p>
               <p>"Go!" he said, turning to the troop with an imperious gesture, "Go! you are
                  disbanded!"</p>
               <p>The troopers gladly obeyed. They quickly returned to their barracks through the
                  crowd, which made way for them, one of them leading the young officer's horse.</p>
               <p>As they disappeared he felt the slender form weigh heavily upon his arm. A sudden
                  pallor diffused itself over Blossom's countenance; the long lashes drooped upon
                  the cheek, and the weak head fell like a wounded bird's upon the young man's
                  breast. The child's knees bent beneath her, and she fainted in his arms.</p>
               <p>A glance told him all, and raising the light figure wholly from the ground, he
                  bore the child quickly beneath the lindens into the palace of the Governor.</p>
               <p>A door was half open at the end of the hall, and perceiving a vessel of water upon
                  a sideboard, he hastened thither and bathed the child's forehead in the cool
                  liquid.</p>
               <p>A slight tremor now ran through her frame, the color returned to her cheeks, and
                  with a deep sigh Blossom opened her eyes.</p>
               <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6146-00000015"/>
               <p>"Ah!" exclaimed the officer, drawing a long breath of relief, "there's your color
                  back again, my little girl! That's well! You are not hurt, I hope. 'Tis but a poor
                  pageant that ends with injury to a child; and I'd much rather resign my commission
                  than have it on my conscience!"</p>
               <p>A species of haughty growl, accompanied by the rustle of silk on the opposite side
                  of the apartment, attracted his attention as he spoke, and, turning round, the
                  young officer saw that he was in presence of Lord Dunmore and his household, who
                  had apparently been so much surprised by his entrance as not to have been able
                  either to speak or move.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <head type="sub">A GLIMPSE OF HIS EXCELLENCY LORD DUNMORE.</head>
               <p>LORD DUNMORE was clad on this occasion with great splendor. His short and somewhat
                  corpulent person had apparently been decorated by his valet with extraordinary
                  care.</p>
               <p>He wore a full dress—silk stockings, gold embroidered waistcoat, velvet surcoat,
                  also embroidered, a bag wig, and a profusion of ruffles. At his button hole
                  fluttered an order of nobility.</p>
               <p>The red and somewhat coarse face did not prepossess strangers in his lordship's
                  favor. They seemed to feel that this countenance must needs indicate a scheming
                  and wholly egotistical nature. And it is certain that reliable records establish
                  this view. Lord Dunmore was not proficient even in intrigue. He bungled in the
                  dark paths which he trod, and stumbled. All his plans went ill. No one would rely
                  on him. More than once, when thrown in collision with the growing spirit of
                  liberty in the colonies, and its advocates in the Burgesses, he had essayed to
                  wheedle the members; and for this purpose had descended, as he conceived, to undue
                  familiarity. But this manner did not set well upon him. Essentially unreliable and
                  scheming by nature, he could not conceal his character, and generally ended by
                  disgusting those whom he desired to conciliate. He was not wanting in those social
                  attentions which his predecessors from the time of Berkeley had found so useful;
                  but the guest whom he entertained generally went away distrusting his uneasy
                  politeness, and doubting the reality and good faith of his Excellency's
                  protestations.</p>
               <p>Lord Dunmore had little of that urbanity and cordial politeness which
                  characterized his amiable predecessor, Francis Fauquier; he possessed none of the
                  tranquil and well-bred courtesy and ease of the justly popular Lord Botetourt, who
                  had coveted no other title than that of "Virginia gentleman." In Fauquier the
                  planters of the colony could and did easily pardon a mania for card playing and
                  wine; they had not the same charity for Lord Dunmore's less amiable weaknesses.
                  While the counties of "Fauquier" and "Botetourt" still remain, and will always,
                  the county of "Dunmore" had its name changed unanimously to "Shenan-doah."</p>
               <p>The people of Virginia at the period brought ugly charges against his Excellency.
                  They said that through his secret agent, Conolly, he was embroiling the Virginians
                  and Pennsylvanians about the boundary line, to divert attention from the designs
                  of the ministry, and dissipate the increasing spirit of rebellion. They added that
                  he had a league with the savages, whom he tempted to make incursions on the
                  Virginia frontier,<ref rend="super" target="#note_002" xml:id="return_002">*</ref>
                  and thus break the opposition to the English Parliament by exhausting the colony's
                  resources. They finally declared that he was a traitor, inasmuch as he attempted
                  to betray Lewis into the hands of the enemy at Point Pleasant. Colonel Bland
                  charged his Excellency with lying; said he held "lewd and filthy orgies in his
                  palace <note place="foot" xml:id="note_002">
                     <p><ref target="#return_002">*</ref>Historical Illustrations, No. II.</p>

                  <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6146-00000016"/> ace;" and the events which attended the
                  last months of his residence seem to support this view of his character.</p>
               <p>His Excellency, indeed, was no favorite with the Virginians, who pardon much if a
                  man possesses refinement and amiability. "Lord Dunmore," says Mr. Wirt, "was not a
                  man of popular manners; he had nothing of the mildness, the purity, the
                  benevolence, and suavity of his predecessor. On the contrary he is represented as
                  having been rude and offensive; coarse in his figure, his countenance and his
                  manners."</p>
               <p>That his Excellency was both cruel and cowardly, the events which attended his
                  flight from Williamsburg, and his piratical ravages on the shores of the
                  Chesapeake, will prove abundantly; defying all explanation or apology.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <head type="sub">IN WHICH HIS EXCELLENCY GETS THE BETTER OF A CHILD.</head>
               <p>LORD DUNMORE stood motionless in his rich dress, by the window, and neither
                  deigned to bow or speak, when the young officer turned to him.</p>
               <p>Fauquier would have been at his side with a smile and a welcome. Dunmore stood
                  still and raised his head haughtily.</p>
               <p>This lofty expression, however, seemed to produce very little effect on the
                  intruder. For some time now he had been accustomed to excellencies and honorables.
                  He placed the child on a settee, and made the ladies a profound bow.</p>
               <p>"Your Excellency will pardon my unceremonious entrance," he said, coolly; "there
                  was no one to announce me, and this child had fainted."</p>
               <p>"Your entrance was very natural, and quite pardonable, sir," said Lord Dunmore,
                  with an expression of mingled hauteur and condescension; and then extending his
                  hand ceremoniously towards the young man, he added, "Lady Dunmore, permit me to
                  present to you, and my daughters, Mr. St. John, lieutenant of my guards."</p>
               <p>The officer bowed low again, but it was easy to see from the slight movement of
                  his proud lip that something in the title thus bestowed upon him was
                  displeasing.</p>
               <p>Lady Dunmore was about to speak, and from the amiable smile upon her countenance,
                  to refer, doubtless, to the pleasant reception she had met with, and Mr. St.
                  John's part therein, when his Excellency forestalled such colloquy by recalling
                  attention to Blossom.</p>
               <p>As he looked at the child there was as little evidence of courtesy or amiability
                  as in his address to Mr. St. John, and he said, almost rudely—</p>
               <p>"Is this young person hurt, sir? I confess I see no traces of any accident, unless
                  you call lassitude an accident."</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John's brow clouded more and more; for under the circumstances of the
                  case, the tone of Lord Dunmore was as much an insult to himself as to the child;
                  and the young man did not seem to have been habituated to insult. Before he could
                  reply, however, the Governor turned away from him to Blossom, and said, in the
                  same careless and rude tone:</p>
               <p>"What happened to you?"</p>
               <p>"I fainted, sir," murmured the child, frightened at the cold face and harsh voice,
                  "in the crowd, sir."</p>
               <p>"A mere trifle! Where do you live—in Williamsburg?"</p>
               <p>"No sir—I came to see the procession, and—"</p>
               <p>"What! you had the imprudence to come to town thus! Your parents show little sense
                  in their government."</p>
               <p>"Paul was with me," murmured Blossom—"we go to school at Uncle Jimmy's, not far
                  from here, and our house is not so far as that. I think I can walk home now,
                  sir!"</p>
               <p>And anxious to get away from the forbidding presence of her interlocutor, Blossom
                  rose to her feet, and made a step toward the door. Her strength, however, was
                  unequal to<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6146-00000017"/> the exertion, and she sank
                  down again with an expression of pain.</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John, whose brow had assumed a darker and darker cloud, as he stood
                  listening to this conversation, would have hastened to her, but he was forestalled
                  by one of the young ladies, who rose quickly, and in a moment was at the child's
                  side. It was the Lady Augusta whom Blossom had met at the old school.</p>
               <p>"Are you much hurt, Blossom?" she said, kindly and softly; "don't try to walk
                  yet."</p>
               <p>The child murmured something which was inaudible.</p>
               <p>"Are you not sick?" asked the young lady, in the same kind voice.</p>
               <p>"No ma'am," faltered Blossom.</p>
               <p>"I'm afraid you are," said the young lady, gazing at the child with tender pity;
                  "you must let his lordship send you home in his chariot."</p>
               <p>"In his chariot, ma'am?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly."</p>
               <p>Blossom murmured that she could walk; she was very much obliged for her kindness;
                  then the child paused, her voice dying away in her throat.</p>
               <p>The young lady had looked at her so kindly, and held the small hand so lovingly in
                  her own, that Blossom, in her weak condition, had been too much affected to
                  speak.</p>
               <p>"Come, Lady Augusta," said Lord Dunmore, coldly, "let us prepare to receive the
                  guests in the drawing-room. As for this child—"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, your lordship," said the young lady submissively and hurriedly, and
                  turning to the child she said:</p>
               <p>"Where do you live?"</p>
               <p>"Just out of town, ma'am."</p>
               <p>"What is your name?"</p>
               <p>"Beatrice, ma'am—but they call me Blossom."</p>
               <p>"Oh I know," said the young lady, "but your other name?"</p>
               <p>"Beatrice Waters, ma'am."</p>
               <p>Lord Dunmore, who had turned stiffly away, wheeled round as he heard this
                  name.</p>
               <p>"Did you say Waters?" he asked curtly.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," murmured Blossom.</p>
               <p>"What Waters?"</p>
               <p>"Sir?"</p>
               <p>"I asked you what was the Christian name of you father."</p>
               <p>"Charles, sir—he is Mr. Charles Waters."</p>
               <p>His Excellency's brow clouded over, and he frowned.</p>
               <p>"Lady Augusta," he said, "do you know who you are fondling?"</p>
               <p>The young lady turned a frightened look upon her father, and murmured some
                  inaudible words.</p>
               <p>"You are bestowing your caresses upon the daughter of the most dangerous—yes! the
                  blackest-hearted rebel in this colony! A man," added Lord Dunmore, with growing
                  choler, "who is a firebrand of sedition, and who will swing from the gallows if my
                  authority lasts, and I lay hands on him! It is <emph>his</emph> offspring that
                     <emph>my</emph> daughter, madame, is bestowing her attentions upon!"</p>
               <p>His Excellency was mastered by one of those sudden fits of anger to which he was
                  constitutionally subject. His countenance reddened, and became puffed up; the vein
                  in his forehead was swollen, and his small keen eyes flashed, as he spoke in his
                  tone of disdainful roughness and anger.</p>
               <p>His family were accustomed to humor him when these fits seized upon him; and by
                  submitting, to thus divert and dissipate those domestic thunderbolts of his
                  lordship.</p>
               <p>One person present, however, did not seem to have been trained to this species of
                  deference. Mr. St. John had apparently been in all ill-humor all day; moreover, he
                  seemed to be accustomed, himself, to courtesy at the very least, and the utter
                  want of ceremony on the part of his lordship, added to the unfeeling insults
                  directed toward his young protegeé, produced in Mr. St. John's countenance an
                  expression of impetuous anger and no little disdain.</p>
               <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6146-00000018"/>
               <p>"Perhaps your lordship is mistaken in the individual who is this child's father,"
                  he now said, with cold courtesy.</p>
               <p>"Impossible, sir! I'm <emph>not</emph> mistaken!" replied his Excellency,
                  surveying the young man with a look which seemed to ask if he had the presumption
                  to address him in that tone.</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John's brow darkened more and more.</p>
               <p>"At least this girl does not resemble a very dangerous rebel," he said, with an
                  imperceptible shade of sarcasm in his voice, which made the Governor's cheek flush
                  with rage.</p>
               <p>"Mr. St. John!" he said.</p>
               <p>"Your Excellency," was the cold reply.</p>
               <p>"This is a singular colloquy! Your meaning, if you please, in reading me a
                  lecture, sir!"</p>
               <p>"I read no lecture to your lordship," replied the young man, with a haughty look,
                  and without lowering his eyes; "my meaning simply is, that whatever may be the
                  character of this child's father—his dangerous character—your lordship can't
                  possibly be afraid of the child herself."</p>
               <p>For a moment his Excellency's countenance resembled a thunder-cloud from which a
                  flash of lightning was about to dart. The vein in his forehead turned black, and
                  his frame trembled with anger. But his prudence suddenly came to control him; he
                  seemed to feel the bad policy of a quarrel with Mr. St. John; and passing from
                  rage to hauteur, he endeavored to speak in a tone of insulted dignity.</p>
               <p>"I am not in the habit of entering into debates with young men, sir," he said,
                  "and I must beg that this discussion may here end. I am sorry to say, Mr. St.
                  John, that I find you, like other gentlemen of this colony, inclined to oppose my
                  opinions and wishes, as well as strangely neglectful of that ceremony and respect
                  which are due to myself, as a peer of the realm and the representative of his
                  majesty! I pass over this occasion, sir, and trust that you will perceive the
                  necessity of not holding arguments with me in future, especially in the presence
                  of my family."</p>
               <p>"I did not wish to argue with your lordship; you questioned me—I replied," said
                  the young man, with internal rage, but outwardly as cold as ice. "If any thing
                  which I have said, has wounded the feelings of your lordship's family, I most
                  humbly pray them to pardon me."</p>
               <p>"Enough, sir," returned the Governor, in no degree mollified, if any thing, more
                  haughtily than before; "the Countess of Dunmore and my daughters are not
                  accustomed to have their feelings wounded by everybody; you may be at rest upon
                  that score, sir. Now let this conversation end."</p>
               <p>"I ask nothing more!" replied Mr. St. John, flushing with anger and disdain at the
                  tone of the Governor.</p>
               <p>"I will see that this young person is conveyed home—if the man Waters does not
                  conceal his abode—but I certainly shall not send my chariot and servants to the
                  house of a traitor!"</p>
               <p>"Your Excellency need put yourself to no trouble—my own carriage is at hand, and I
                  take charge of the child."</p>
               <p>"Do so, sir; and permit me to congratulate you upon making the friendly
                  acquaintance of a treason-monger! It is quite in character to allow his helpless
                  daughter to wander about unprotected. A traitor makes a heartless father, and a
                  bad man."</p>
               <p>Before Mr. St. John could speak, another voice was heard—it was Blossom's. The
                  child had listened with pale cheeks, and a frightened look, to the fiery colloquy,
                  and had not dared to open her lips. But now her father was insulted more grossly
                  than before; his very affection for her was called in question; the little heart
                  boiled over with pain and anguish; and clasping her hands Blossom cried:</p>
               <p>"Oh no, sir! indeed, indeed papa's not bad! He loves me dearly, and he did n't
                  know I came, sir."</p>
               <p>"Enough of your childish twaddle!" said Dunmore contemptuously. "I'm not here to
                  be wearied by it. I'll make your rebel father whine, too, before I have done with
                  him!"</p>
               <p>"Oh me!" sobbed Blossom, "please let me go, sir!<pb n="36-37"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000019"/> I do not feel well. I ought not to stay and hear
                  papa abused."</p>
               <p>"Go, then!"</p>
               <p>Blossom rose quickly, with a flood of tears, and turned toward the door. But again
                  her strength failed her; she turned deadly pale as her bruised foot touched the
                  carpet, and fell back sobbing.</p>
               <p>The arms of Mr. St. John received her, and thus standing, with pale face and fiery
                  eyes bent on the Governor, his indignation and disdain were imperial.</p>
               <p>He would have spoken, but his pale lips refused their office. With a single look
                  of defiance at his Excellency, the young man raised the form of the child
                  completely in his arms, and left the apartment and the palace.</p>
               <p>He passed rapidly with the sobbing girl along the graveled walk beneath the
                  lindens, and issued from the great gate. Without pausing, he strode along
                  Gloucester street, followed by wondering eyes, and soon reached the <emph>Raleigh
                     Tavern.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>In fifteen minutes a handsome chariot, with four splendid bay horses, stood before
                  the door, and Mr. St. John deposited the child in the vehicle. Her delicate form
                  sunk into the luxurious velvet seat as into a bed of down, and Mr. St. John took
                  his place by her side. He then gave an order to the negro driver, and the chariot
                  proceeded slowly out of the town in a westerly direction.</p>
               <p>The young man had made but one allusion to the scene at the palace; uttered but
                  one word; that word was—</p>
               <p>"Vulgarian!"</p>
               <p>It was Mr. St. John's honest opinion of his Excellency Lord Dunmore.</p>
               <p>The evening was a lovely one, and the sun had sunk beyond the belt of forests,
                  leaving the sky rosy and brilliant, and swimming in a gentle mist. The birds sang
                  merrily, and the woodland road unwound itself like a ribbon before them as they
                  penetrated into the leafy depths of the forest.</p>
               <p>The anger and disdain of Mr. St. John slowly disappeared, and he seemed to enjoy
                  the freshness and innocence of his little companion. At last they reached
                  Blossom's abode. It was a small cottage, fronting south, and had about it an air
                  of home comfort which was very attractive. The tender foliage of May appeared to
                  wreathe the small portico, the drooping eaves, and even the old chimneys; and a
                  thousand flowers, chiefly early roses, studded the diminutive lawn, and filled the
                  warm air of evening with their fragrance.</p>
               <p>Blossom had indeed told her companion that the cottage was called "Roseland," and
                  the name was perfectly appropriate.</p>
               <p>On the threshold was no less a personage than Mr. Paul, in an attitude of profound
                  despair. He had just returned to the cottage, hoping to find his companion, from
                  whom he had been separated in the crowd, and not finding her was about to go back
                  to the town, he declared, and find her or perish in the attempt. That was happily
                  unnecessary, St. John said, with a smile; and so, with mutual good will, the young
                  man and the children parted.</p>
               <p>St. John returned in his chariot to Williamsburg.</p>
               <p>The town was brilliantly illuminated. From every window along the main
                  thoroughfare lights blazed in honor of his Excellency and his family.<ref
                     rend="super" target="#note_003" xml:id="return_003">*</ref> The crowd of
                  revelers was greater than ever, and the palace of the Governor was one mass of
                  light—more especially the great drawing-room, where, under the globe lamps, and
                  fronting the portraits of the king and queen, the amiable countess, supported by
                  her daughters, received the congratulations of the gentry of the colony upon her
                  reunion with his Excellency.</p>

                  <p><ref target="#return_003">*</ref>Historical Illustrations, No. III.</p>
               </note>
               <p>Dismissing his chariot, Mr. St. John went and gazed for some moments at the
                  brilliant front of the palace.</p>
               <p>"The silly masquerade may go on its way without my assistance," he muttered,
                  coldly. "I'll not go there and bow and simper when his lordship 's put a slight on
                     me—<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6146-00000020"/> insulted me! Hang him! let the
                  rest pay him their respects—I won't, and there 's an end on 't."</p>
               <p>With these words Mr. St. John retraced his steps to the Raleigh Tavern, and
                  sitting down, demanded a bottle of wine and some biscuits.</p>
               <p>Having finished his repast, he went out, passed down Gloucester street, and
                  entered a house, whose second floor he occupied. Throwing himself upon a lounge,
                  he tossed his hat and sword on the floor, and looked through the window.</p>
               <p>"I 'm the only one who do n't illuminate," he said. "Well, so let it be."</p>
               <p>And leaning back, he closed his eyes—meditated, and from meditation glided into
                  sleep.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE GREAT GRANDSON OF POCAHONTAS.</head>
               <p>HENRY ST. JOHN was the only son of Colonel John St. John, of "Flower of Hundreds,"
                  in the county of Prince George. This John was himself the only son of Henry St.
                  John, Esquire, called "King Harry," who having run through a fine estate in
                  Hertfordshire, England, came to Virginia about the time of Bacon's rebellion, in
                  which he took part against the government, but, by good luck, escaped with the
                  payment of a heavy fine. He married, the second time—his first wife, who was a
                  Miss Pendleton, having died without issue—Miss Virginia Rolfe, daughter of Thomas
                  Rolfe, Esquire, the only son of Pocahontas, daughter of Powhatan, King of
                  Virginia, whose empire stretched from Florida to the great lakes, and from the
                  Atlantic to the Mississippi.</p>
               <p>The Mr. Henry St. John of our narrative was, therefore, the lineal descendant of
                  Pocahontas.</p>
               <p>We have little genius or fondness for the details of pedigree gree, but surely 't
                  is a source of noble pride to be descended from our dear Virginia maiden. Royalty
                  and nobility are but vulgar things, and the boast of Norman blood is but the
                  child's fondness for the rattle of a toy. The grace of the fashion of it
                  perisheth—its glorious beauty is a fading flower—only the shadow of a shadow
                  stays. It is different in the case of the descendants of our little queen of the
                  West. Her patent of nobility was won beneath the war club raised above the head of
                  a poor captive; her royalty was the royalty of a noble heart, of a great and pure
                  devotion to the cause of love and mercy.</p>
               <p>So writes the good author of these manuscripts. Let us pass, however, to the young
                  gentleman who had in his veins the blood of this new Indian royalty.</p>
               <p>As he sleeps, in the flood of light from the tall silver candlesticks, it is not
                  difficult to fancy, from the wild grace of his attitude, and the character of his
                  face, that something of his origin reveals itself.</p>
               <p>The face is a handsome one, with a clear brown tint, almost that of a brunette,
                  and the hair is dark and waving. The rounded and prominent chin indicates
                  resolution, and the curve of the lips, which possess great mobility, as plainly
                  show that the young man is subject to strong passions. In the scene with the
                  Governor we have observed the quick shades of anger and resentment only; but now
                  this has quite disappeared, and, sleeping like a placid infant, all the features
                  of the face have subsided into softness and repose. In his dreams the young man
                  smiles, and the smile is one of great sweetness.</p>
               <p>Leaving to the course of the narrative any further indications of Mr. Henry St.
                  John's peculiarities, we proceed to relate that, at the end of an hour, he was
                  waked by a knock at the door, which was followed by the entrance of a young man
                  clad in the height of the fashion. Indeed, it might almost be said that this young
                  gentleman's costume was one mass of lace and embroidery. The drop curls of his
                  flaxen peruke were glossy with perfumed powder, a<pb n="40-41"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000021"/> little dress sword just lifted up the skirt of his
                  richly decorated pourpoint of Mecklenburg silk, and his aristocratic hands were
                  covered with the finest <foreign xml:lang="FRA">point de Venise.</foreign> Mr. Tom
                  Alston—for that was the name of the worthy—presented a mixture of the fop and the
                  philosopher in his dress and manner, and seemed to have stepped carelessly from
                  the frame of one of Vandyke's pictures.</p>
               <p>He extended two fingers to his friend and sat down.</p>
               <p>"Not sleeping, Harry, my boy?" he said. "Why not at the Governor's?"</p>
               <p>"I preferred staying away. Did you go?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—a crowd of nice girls, and refreshments of a pleasing description."</p>
               <p>"Very well—but I do n't regret my absence," said Mr. St. John; "the fact is, Tom,
                  I 'm tired of his lordship, and think I'll resign my commission. I 'm no man's
                  servant, and I won't be his Excellency's."</p>
               <p>"Eh? His servant?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. I am absolutely nothing more. There, let us leave the subject, or I 'm sure
                  to burst forth into useless expletives."</p>
               <p>"Expletives?" said Mr. Alston, tranquilly. "Come, tell me all about it. I see that
                  something has occurred, and I 'm really dying to hear a bit of scandal—absolutely
                  none for a whole week. Do proceed, Harry, my boy, and narrate from the beginning,
                  with all the orations, like that tiresome old Thucydides."</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John was silent for a moment, and then said:</p>
               <p>"I do n't care if I do, Tom. I feel as if the historic muse would come at my call,
                  and I'll try her. Well, here goes, but you are not to yawn at my apologue."</p>
               <p>"By no means," said Mr. Alston, with an air of reproach. "Proceed, my friend."</p>
               <p>"Well, you must know that there formerly resided in a country called Virginia a
                  young man called Harry St. John. You understand so far?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Well, this young man, who had the misfortune to lose his parents in his
                  childhood, was sole heir to an estate called the 'Flower of Hundreds,' upon which
                  estate there was a big old house, full of deer antlers, fine furniture, tall
                  mirrors, portraits of old fellows in periwigs, and dames in odd-looking dresses;
                  and in the stables were as fine a collection of thorough-breds, 't was said, as
                  any in the colony. Every thing else was ample and comfortable, and it was
                  reasonable for the youngster to expect a life of ease and satisfaction—was it not?
                  He might marry his cousin, grow fat, preside at the county court, and be a
                  respectable vestryman of the parish. There were plenty of foxes on his lands, and
                  a quarrelsome neighbor near at hand, with whom he might, at any moment, plunge
                  into a good comfortable lawsuit. In a single word, all the elements of human
                  happiness were at the young fellow's disposal, and he had only to 'enter and
                  enjoy,' as the lawyers say."</p>
               <p>"He was a lucky fellow, my boy. I should like to know him," said Mr. Alston.</p>
               <p>"As to the luck, there's the question," continued Mr. St. John, "for nature had
                  put a nail in the young man's shoe—restlessness. He longed for something more
                  exciting than plantation life. Having left college, he came into his property,
                  carefully administered by his excellent uncle, Colonel Vane; but very soon he
                  began to grow dissatisfied. You see, the couches were too soft, the beds were too
                  large, the wines were too good, and the fields which stretched far away to the
                  horizon from the portico of the old hall, were deficient in rugged beauty and
                  picturesqueness, such as the mountains yield. In a word, the youthful heir was
                  tired of the insipidity of farm life, and longed for something like adventure,
                  having a private impression of his own that the clash of swords and the whistling
                  of bullets would make merrier music than the winds in the trees, or the waves lap
                  ping on the banks of the river."</p>
               <p>"Odd," observed Mr. Alston, "but I think I understand."</p>
               <p>"Well," proceeded Mr. St. John, "this young fellow<pb n="42-43"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000022"/> struggled with his passion for two or three years,
                  but at the end of that time his predilection got the better of him. A nobleman
                  came to be Governor of the country he lived in——a vulgar fellow named
                  Dunmore."</p>
               <p>"Oh! a vulgar fellow do you say? But proceed, my friend."</p>
               <p>"You'll see before I end, if I am wrong in my characterization, Tom," continued
                  Mr. St. John. "Well, as I said, this man, Dunmore, came to the country in
                  question, called Virginia, and a great talk was made about his excellence and
                  greatness. He professed to be most solicitous about Virginia, and turned his
                  attention especially to repelling the attacks of savages upon the western
                  frontier. He said he wished the inhabitants to hold themselves in readiness to
                  march under his command, and as a proof of his intention to act vigorously, he
                  brought with him some foreign soldiers, who would serve as a nucleus for the
                  proposed forces. Exception was, however, taken by some persons to the presence of
                  this body of men, and in order to allay the disquiet, his Excellency sought for a
                  Virginian who should be placed, as it were, in their front rank, to disarm this
                  sentiment. Here commenced the connection of Mr. St. John with his Excellency.
                  Introduced to him as one of the large landed proprietors of the colony, his
                  Excellency treated him with much politeness, and finally requested private
                  interviews. Would Mr. St. John accept the commission of lieutenant, commanding,
                  for the present, this nucleus?—they would ere long march to the frontier, and much
                  glory would ensue. Do you understand?"</p>
               <p>His friend nodded.</p>
               <p>"The aforesaid Mr. St. John was then twenty-three or so, and had greater thirst
                  for adventure than ever. Would he accept? Yes, most willingly. No sooner said than
                  done. He leaves his estate, comes to the capital, establishes himself therein as
                  becomes a soldier, and gloriously parades on horse-back, in fine uniform, at the
                  head of his troops. He enters into military affairs with ardor and enthusiasm—he
                  trains his men in quick evolutions, in bush fighting, in rapid discharge of
                  pistols, and in approved cut and thrust with the saber. He sees that their arms
                  are as brilliant as silver; their uniform and entire equipments perfect. He calls
                  on his Excellency every day to inquire for news from the frontier, and receiving
                  comforting answers, goes away twirling his mustaches, his sword clanking against
                  his boots, his head full of martial glory, and conscious of the admiration of
                  every urchin who beholds him."</p>
               <p>"Of none of the girls—eh, my boy?" inquired Mr. Alston.</p>
               <p>"Doubtless, for you know the gentler sex admire the soldier, at least some of
                  them. But to proceed. The young man, you see, is ready, impatient; but somehow the
                  order to march is delayed, his Excellency's excuses are repeated, the young
                  fellow's assiduity finally seems distasteful. Moreover, the troops he commands
                  seem permanently stationed in guard houses, flanking his lordship's gate—they
                  attend solely on his lordship's person—they ride behind his coach, and are called
                  by him, "My Guards." His lordship is a king, the young lieutenant a satrap of the
                  provinces, and, contrary to the habit of Virginians, he has become an upper
                  servant. Can you wonder that the result is distaste upon his part; that he begins
                  to think his Excellency insincere? He finally concludes that he is tricked, and it
                  is just at this moment that he receives orders to marshal "My Guards," and go and
                  receive the royal family on their entrance, which event occurred this morning.
                  Well, he obeyed. They were ladies, and he was far from objecting to take part in
                  the pageantry. But he found in this cortége other characters—lords, honorables,
                  captains, drivers, footmen, outriders—it was his place to escort them all. He did
                  do it. He mounted guard at the palace gate even, to keep the ill-bred Virginians
                  at their proper distance. He succeeded. Well, now for the conclusion. The young
                  soldier rode a spirited horse; the music of a band annoyed him, the animal became
                  restive, and the result was the overthrow of a child, who<pb n="44-45"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000023"/> rolled beneath his feet, and, when the young man
                  raised her, fainted away. He went to the nearest point for some cold water,
                  procured it in the palace, and for presuming to so intrude was insulted by his
                  Excellency. You see his lordship was an English nobleman, and the young man was
                  only a Virginia gentleman. Not only the young man himself was outraged, but the
                  child who accompanied him was grossly insulted and wounded! and Mr. Lieutenant St.
                  John was requested to retire and make way for his betters! Curse me! if the man's
                  one particle of a gentleman, and I'll throw his commission back in his face!"
                  cried St. John, flushing, and thus breaking forth with long-gathering
                  indignation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston was silent for some moments, apparently musing tranquilly upon the
                  history to which he had just listened. At last he said:</p>
               <p>"Throw it back, Harry! what's the use? Do n't take the trouble—rather come with me
                  to my house of 'Moorefield,' where I will try and entertain you, though this
                  peruke from Mr. George Lafong's, who calls himself a wigmaker, is making me silent
                  and melancholy. Come, Harry, my boy, come with me."</p>
               <p>"No, Tom," said his friend, "I'll tell his lordship my candid opinion of him, if
                  he arrests me the next moment. Hang him! he sha'n't tread on me, if he is a
                  tyrant!"</p>
               <p>And Mr. St. John scowled in imagination at Lord Dunmore, with a sincerity that was
                  very striking.</p>
               <p>"You won't go to Moorefield?" said Mr. Alston, smiling; "but that's just the way
                  you always treat me. May I make a second suggestion, however, Harry? Go
                  to—Vanely."</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John turned his head quickly, and looked at his friend. As he encountered
                  Mr. Alston's eyes and smile, something almost like a blush diffused itself over
                  his cheek.</p>
               <p>"Ah! ah!" said Mr. Alston, laughing, "there's a fine historian! You make a
                  splendid historic narrative, and you leave out the most striking event in the life
                  of your hero! You carefully forget to mention that this Virginia Achilles had a
                  Briseis—this Hector of Prince George county, a prospective pective Andromache—and
                  that the nodding plume of war was put on to flash in the eyes of somebody!"</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John blushed unmistakably this time, and then burst out laughing.</p>
               <p>"Well if I did, Tom," he said, "what 's the odds? She 's the loveliest girl in the
                  colony."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps! But why not go and try your luck, then?"</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John sighed.</p>
               <p>"I 'm afraid it 's no use," he said; "she loves me, but unfortunately she's not in
                  love with me."</p>
               <p>"A profoundly philosophical distinction; but did you never hear the Spanish
                  proverb, 'Patience, and shuffle the cards?' Now the cards are at 'Vanely;' leave
                  this abode of royalty with me, forget his Excellency, and go see Dulcinea."</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John pondered, and from the varying color of his tell-tale cheek, it was
                  plain what he was thinking of.</p>
               <p>"Well," he said at last, "I'll do so, Tom. I'll follow the advice scratched on the
                  wall yonder, with the odd name, <emph>Sir Asinus</emph> to it—'<emph>The duty of a
                     subject is submission.</emph>' Yes, I'll leave this wretched mimic court, and
                  go to Vanely, provided you stay all night and go with me."</p>
               <p>"Done," said Mr. Alston, "and now let us have a game of tric-trac."</p>
               <p>"Willingly," Mr. St. John replied, "and my first stake shall be these tawdry
                  epaulets of gold thread against six-pence—the value I attach to them!"</p>
               <p>Cards and wine were quickly brought by a servant in waiting, and the young men
                  commenced playing.</p>
               <p>Two hours afterwards they were sound asleep, and an attentive listener might have
                  heard the lieutenant of his Excellency's guards murmur the name of a woman of whom
                  he seemed to be dreaming.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <head type="sub">CONSPIRACY.</head>
               <p>WE have glanced at the scenes of the day on which, amid the glare of sunlight, and
                  the noisy plaudits of the crowd, the Countess of Dunmore entered grandly the old
                  capital.</p>
               <p>We shall now pass to the night world; to a few scenes which concealed themselves
                  beneath the silence and gloom.</p>
               <p>The lights in the city of Williamsburg had one by one disappeared, as lord and
                  lady, noble and commoner sought their pillows; all the noises of evening and night
                  had long since died away, and a gloomy silence, only interrupted from time to time
                  by the low muttering of distant thunder, reigned over the ancient town.</p>
               <p>There was one exception, however, to this total darkness. From the lofty window of
                  a tall mansion which rose like an attenuated ghost above the surrounding roofs, a
                  faint glimmer, like a star, just dispelled the gloom, and even this much light
                  seemed to escape by accident through the chinks of the carefully closed oaken
                  shutters.</p>
               <p>Let us ascend the precipitous and winding stair-way of the half-deserted mansion,
                  and opening the door of the turret-like chamber, endeavor to discover what
                  business is thus being transacted under the jealous vail of silence and
                  darkness.</p>
               <p>The apartment is destitute of all ornament, the furniture consisting only of a
                  long table, a few rough chairs, and some shelves filled with old volumes and
                  papers. It has two occupants. The first is a rough-looking man, covered with dust
                  like a courier after a long journey, who is slumbering heavily upon a bear skin
                  thrown down in one corner. The other inmate of the room sits at the table writing
                  rapidly—two loaded pistols lying within reach of his hand.</p>
               <p>He is a man of middle age, clad in a suit of dark cloth, affording no indication
                  of his character or station. In the face and form of this person, however, there
                  is more to attract attention.</p>
               <p>The countenance of the stranger is one of those which, once seen, haunts the
                  memory. He has not passed middle age, apparently, but the thin brown locks around
                  his broad forehead are sprinkled with gray; labor or care has furrowed deep lines
                  from temple to temple, and a slight stoop in the neck communicates to the general
                  carriage that air of intense meditation which characterizes profound thinkers, or
                  those upon whom is thrown responsibility of the most critical character. Covered
                  with the pallor of care or exhausting toil, with clear-cut and resolute features,
                  eyes burning with a gloomy flame beneath bushy brows, and lips set sternly with an
                  expression of iron will, every thing in the face of the stranger indicated an
                  organization of the largest strength, and an intellectual vigor which no obstacle
                  could daunt.</p>
               <p>His thin muscular fingers traversed the paper for an hour without pausing
                  scarcely, and then, as he reached the end, the stranger laid down his pen, and
                  leaned back in his leather chair.</p>
               <p>"Why, I grow old!" he murmured. "This writing for a day and a night only, begins
                  to fatigue me. 'T is no matter."</p>
               <p>And without further words he set about folding the written sheets. They were then
                  enveloped in stout brown paper, corded, and securely waxed. Upon this envelope was
                  written simply— <q>
                     <p>"<hi rend="i"/>To Mr. Samuel Adams,<lb/> "<hi rend="i"/>At Boston, in the
                        Province of<lb/> "<hi rend="i"/>Massachusetts."</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>A word awoke the sleeper, who rose quickly and stood at the stranger's side. Few
                  words were exchanged; the two men seemed to understand each other, and the
                  stranger gave his directions in a brief low tone, to which the courier replied by
                  a slight movement of the head only.</p>
               <p>"This to the town of Baltimore," said the stranger, taking<pb n="48-49"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000025"/> ing a dispatch similar to the one he had just
                  finished—"you know the house. This, to Philadelphia—guard it carefully. This, to
                  the port of New York—as quickly as possible. Have you enough money?"</p>
               <p>The courier laid his leather purse on the table, and the stranger examined its
                  contents.</p>
               <p>"'Tis enough, unless your horse fails, but that must not happen. Here is more
                  gold, for which you will sign a receipt."</p>
               <p>The receipt was written, signed by the courier, and deposited in a drawer with a
                  number of others.</p>
               <p>"Go at once now, and proceed cautiously as you leave the town. The patrol is
                  abroad."</p>
               <p>"Yes, your honor; never fear me. My service to you, and good times to the
                  cause."</p>
               <p>The stranger returned the salute, and the courier disappeared. In a few moments
                  his horse's hoofs were heard as he cautiously proceeded along Gloucester street,
                  and the stranger who watched the retreating shadow from his window, drew a long
                  breath of satisfaction.</p>
               <p>"Now for the rest," he said, and leaning against one of the panels of the oaken
                  wainscot, he touched the spring of a secret closet, which flew open. From this
                  aperture he took a bundle of letters, which he placed in his bosom. He then
                  rapidly returned to the table, secured the two pistols in his belt, and throwing a
                  cloak over his shoulders, put out the light, and descended to the street.</p>
               <p>The moon was just rising through a bank of threatening clouds, which at one moment
                  obscured the red orb, then swept onward and permitted the full light to shine. No
                  wayfarer was visible upon the silent and deserted street, and an expression of
                  satisfaction came again to the features of the stranger.</p>
               <p>He wrapped his cloak more closely around him, and passing along in the shadow of
                  the houses, stopped, at the end of ten minutes, before a low building, into the
                  basement or rather cellar of which he descended by a flight of precipitous ous
                  steps. All was dark, but the stranger proceeded without stopping along the damp
                  passage way, and struck quickly thrice, then, after a pause, once again, upon an
                  iron-bound door. A boy opened the door, and he entered.</p>
               <p>Two men were engaged at a printing table striking off, by means of a "deer's foot"
                  and mallet, copies of a species of circular. Upon one end of the table lay a pile
                  of these printed sheets, still damp, which every moment received a new addition
                  from the cautious labors of the printers.</p>
               <p>A masonic movement of the head was the sole recognition which passed. To the
                  stranger's brief question of the number of copies printed, the reply was, "two
                  hundred."</p>
               <p>"That is enough for the present moment," he said; "fold them securely."</p>
               <p>This was done rapidly, and with great skill, and in five minutes the stranger
                  stood again in the street. He proceeded, as cautiously as before, on his return to
                  the building from which he had issued, stopping for a moment in the shadow of one
                  of the houses to let two of the Governor's guardsmen in uniform go by.</p>
               <p>They passed within three feet of the silent figure, jesting roughly, their sabers
                  rattling against their huge horseman's boots. The figures finally disappeared at
                  the corner of Palace street, and the solitary man hastened onward, keeping, as
                  before, in the shadow.</p>
               <p>He soon reached the tall house from which he had dispatched the courier to the
                  northern provinces, and, opening a narrow gate, disappeared. Behind the building,
                  in the deep shadow, a horse awaited him, and, mounting, he issued forth and
                  proceeded cautiously in a westerly direction, keeping as much as possible in the
                  darkness.</p>
               <p>He reached in safety the last house of the town, the muttering over head nearly
                  drowning the noise of his horse's hoofs, and was about to issue into the country,
                  when, as he came opposite the door of this house, a party of the Governor's
                  patrol, who had been drinking in the ordinary, challenged him and commanded him to
                  halt. The stranger's<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6146-00000026"/> reply was the spur
                  in his horse's side, which made the animal bound ten feet.</p>
               <p>A second and louder challenge was instantly followed by the quick report of a
                  carbine, and a ball passed through the horseman's cloak between his side and his
                  bridle hand. With an unconscious movement as rapid as lightning he drew one of his
                  pistols, cocked it, and leveled it, with flashing eyes, at his assailants.</p>
               <p>He did not discharge it, however; quickly replacing it in his belt, he muttered,
                  "Useless!" and put spur to his horse. Before a second carbine could be brought to
                  the shoulder, the figures of the stranger and his flying animal had disappeared
                  like shadows under the gloomy foliage of the great woods. Without checking his
                  horse, and with the air of a man who knows the road as well by night as by day,
                  the stranger went on rapidly, penetrating deeper and deeper into the forest, whose
                  heavy boughs moaned in the wind.</p>
               <p>At the end of half an hour's rapid riding, he came to a sort of glade in the
                  woods, and as he emerged from the dense shadow the moon burst forth from a black
                  cloud, and poured a flood of yellow light upon the open space. Beneath a huge oak,
                  a confused mass of men and horses revealed itself, and the stranger was challenged
                  a second time.</p>
               <p>"Good!" he said with satisfaction; "you are watchful, friend. Wake your comrades;
                  't is time for them to be in the saddle."</p>
               <p>In five minutes as many men were mounted and awaiting silently their directions.
                  The stranger drew from his breast the package which he had taken from the
                  wainscotting.</p>
               <p>"West Augusta," he said, briefly.</p>
               <p>One of the horsemen silently rode up and took the dispatch held out to him.</p>
               <p>"Frederick," continued the stranger.</p>
               <p>A second horseman came and took this letter as the other had done. In the same
                  manner dispatches addressed "Fairfax," "Orange," "Culpepper," "Westmoreland,"
                  "Botetourt," "Essex," "Lancaster," "Accomac," and to other counties ties, were
                  delivered in turn, one courier having charge of all lying upon his route. The
                  entire province of Virginia, north of the James, was thus apportioned out to these
                  five men, who seemed to understand perfectly what was expected of them.</p>
               <p>"Friends," said the stranger, wrapping his cloak around him as he delivered the
                  last dispatch, "I need not tell you to be cautious in the carriage and delivery of
                  these missives. You know their importance, and every day the times grow more
                  dangerous, the encroachments of the government upon private rights more daring. I
                  do not conceal that the dispatches you have received contain treason. Carry them
                  to his Excellency Lord Dunmore, and I will hang on Tower Hill, if I 'm taken.
                     <emph>You</emph> will be rewarded richly, friends. Enough! let us now go to our
                  work!"</p>
               <p>And making a salute with his hand, the stranger was saluted in turn by the party
                  of men, who, only replying by an indistinct murmur, diverged upon their various
                     routes.<ref rend="super" target="#note_004" xml:id="return_004">*</ref>

               </note>
               <p>The solitary horseman retraced rapidly the road by which he had come, for the
                  space of a mile; then taking a bridle-path to the left, he proceeded more slowly.
                  In a quarter of an hour he found himself in front of a small cottage, lost like a
                  leaf in the depths of the woods. On its roof the moon poured a silver flood—the
                  storm had muttered itself away into the distance.</p>
               <p>He dismounted, opened the door by means of a master-key, and taking a light which
                  was burning upon the table, ascended the stair-case to his chamber.</p>
               <p>Upon a chair lay a valise, ready prepared for a journey, and as the eye of the
                  stranger fell upon it, his brow relaxed, and an expression of softness which his
                  features seemed incapable of, communicated to the resolute countenance a singular
                  attraction.</p>
               <p>Then his head turned unconsciously as it were toward a door leading from the
                  chamber into another, apparently. This door he cautiously opened, and passed
                  through into an adjoining room.</p>
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6146-00000027"/>
               <p>It was the chamber of a girl, full of little feminine ornaments, and filled, if we
                  may so speak, with an atmosphere of purity and innocence. The indefinable grace of
                  childhood seemed to pervade the balmy air, half illumined by the soaring moon
                  which poured through the open casement its mellow light, and in the midst of this
                  flood of radiance, a child was sleeping in a little white bed.</p>
               <p>It was a girl of about ten, with delicate features, long silken lashes, and cheeks
                  tinted with faint roses. The lips smiled in sleep, and possessed great sweetness
                  in curve and expression; the hair of the child was light brown, and fell in curls
                  upon her white night-dress, and the bare arm which supported her cheek. The
                  fringed counterpane rose and fell gently with the breathing of the little sleeper,
                  and her forehead was bathed in the faint and almost imperceptible dews of
                  slumber.</p>
               <p>As he gazed at the young creature, the brilliant and fiery eyes of the stranger
                  softened more and more, his stern features relaxed, he murmured softly, "my little
                  Blossom!" and bending over the child, he pressed upon her forehead a kiss of
                  indescribable tenderness. The small frame seemed to thrill even in slumber, and
                  the lips murmured something, but the girl did not awake. The stranger knelt at the
                  bedside—remained in this devout attitude for a long time—then rising, pressed a
                  second kiss upon the child's lips, and left the apartment.</p>
               <p>He made a few preparations, and was soon in the saddle, riding rapidly in a
                  southern direction through the moonlit forest. As he went on, his stern features
                  resumed their expression of austere resolution—the fire of his eyes returned—he
                  was iron again. Again his dominant idea possessed him, and he muttered broken
                  words.</p>
               <p>"Yes!" he said aloud finally, "at last I think the struggle comes! The light of a
                  glorious dawn begins to touch the gloomy east! The iron heel is almost down upon
                  the forehead, and henceforth there 'll be no appeal to the miserable justice of
                  the king. The true King of kings, the God of Battles will decide! O Lord of Lords,
                  fight for us!—make us free!"</p>
               <p>The head raised devoutly, sank again, and the stranger rode on silently, the
                  stillness of the forest only broken by the noise of his horse's hoofs, or the
                  mournful sobbing of the wind.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">VANELY.</head>
               <p>EARLY on the morning after their colloquy, Mr. St. John and his friend, Tom
                  Alston, had left Williamsburg far in the distance, crossed the river, and were
                  pursuing their way gayly through the spring forest, in the direction of
                  Vanely.</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John had thrown aside his uniform, and wore a simple but elegant
                  cavalier's suit—a coat of drab silk, pliable knee breeches of dressed buckskin,
                  and fair-topped boots, fitting closely to the leg and ankle. He rode his fine
                  sorrel "Tallyho," and the animal champed the bit, and tossed his handsome head,
                  with evident satisfaction at the breath of his native air.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tom Alston prefers a "sulky" for traveling—and mounted in the circular leather
                  chair, high above the wheels of the airy-looking vehicle, he holds, with dainty
                  fingers clad in soft gauntlets, the slender "ribbands," cutting at butterflies
                  occasionally for amusement.</p>
               <p>The simple landscape seems entertainment enough for Mr. St. John. He looks with
                  joyous eyes upon the smooth road winding along beneath the budding foliage of the
                  forest, and his impulsive nature fills with delight as he inhales the fresh air
                  laden with the perfume of leaves and flowers. He is no longer lieutenant of his
                  Excellency's Body Guards—only Henry St. John. He laughs, leans idly on Tallyho's
                  neck and talks to him, follows the flight of a hawk across the blue sky overhead,
                  or bursts into snatches of song, in<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6146-00000028"/>
                  opposition to the oriole, whose joyous carol fills the wood with music.</p>
               <p>The young men passed rapidly through the green forest, and at last, as they
                  mounted a slope, Mr. St. John extended his hand and cried,</p>
               <p>"There 's Vanely! See how it shines in the sun, on the hill top! The oaks are
                  huger to my eyes, and the sunshine brighter there! Adieu, Williamsburg!" cried the
                  young man, rising in his saddle, "and welcome Vanely! I think 't is a capital
                  exchange!"</p>
               <p>And putting spur to his horse, Mr. Harry St. John set forward at full gallop
                  again.</p>
               <p>"I think I know what makes the sun shine brighter, my youngster," said Mr. Alston,
                  as he followed rapidly; "there are two violet-colored eyes there. Well, there are
                  two black orbs as handsome!"</p>
               <p>And Mr. Alston indulged in a private and confidential nod to himself. Soon
                  afterwards they had reached the broad esplanade in front of the house.</p>
               <p>Vanely was one of those old mansions whose walls still stand in Virginia, the
                  eloquent memorials of other times, and the good old race who filled the past days
                  with so many festivals, and such high revelry.</p>
               <p>The first brick of the edifice had been laid upon the lap of a baby afterwards
                  known as Colonel Vane, and passed through his tiny fingers. The life of the
                  mansion and the owner thus commenced together. It was a broad, rambling old house,
                  perched on a sort of upland which commanded a noble landscape of field and river;
                  and in front of the portal, two great oaks stretched out their gigantic arms,
                  gnarled and ancient, like guardians of the edifice. In these, as in the hundred
                  others, scattered over the undulating lawn, and crowning every knoll, a thousand
                  birds were caroling, and a swarm of swallows darted backward and forward, circling
                  around the stacks of chimneys, and making the air vocal with their merriment.</p>
               <p>There was about the odd old mansion an indefinable air of comfort and repose, and
                  within, these characteristics were equally discernible. The old portraits ranged
                  along the hall in oaken frames, looked serenely down upon the beholder, and with
                  powdered heads, and lace ruffs, and carefully arranged drapery, seemed to extend a
                  stately and impressive welcome. Sir Arthur Vane, who fought for a much less worthy
                  man at Marston Moor, was there, with his flowing locks, and peaked head, and wide
                  collar of rich Venice lace, covering his broad shoulders;—and Miss Maria Vane,
                  with towering curls, and jewel-decorated fingers, playing with her lap-dog,
                  smiling meanwhile with that winning grace which made her a toast in the days of
                  her kinsman Bolingbroke, and Mr. Addison;—and more than one tender and delicate
                  child, like violets or snow-drops, in the midst of these sturdy family trunks, or
                  blooming roses, added a finishing grace to the old walls—that grace which nothing
                  but the forms of children ever give. Deer antlers, guns, an old sword or two, and
                  a dozen London prints of famous race-horses, completed the adornment of the hall;
                  and from this wide space, the plain oaken stairway ran up, and the various doors
                  opened to the apartments on the ground floor of the mansion.</p>
               <p>On the May morning we have spoken of, the old house was in its glory; for the
                  trees were covering themselves densely with fresh green foliage, and the grounds
                  were carpeted with emerald grass, studded with flowers, waving their delicate
                  heads, and murmuring gently in the soft spring breeze, and the golden sunshine.
                  The oriole swung from the topmost boughs, and poured his flood of song upon the
                  air; the woodpecker's bright wings flapped from tree to tree; and a multitude of
                  swamp-sparrows flashed in and out of the foliage and fruit blossoms, or circled
                  joyously around the snowy fringe-trees sparkling in the sunshine. From the distant
                  fields and forests the monotonous caw of the crows, winging their slow way through
                  the blue sky, indicated even on the part of these ancient enemies of the
                  cornfield, joyous satisfaction at the incoming of the warm<pb n="56-57"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000029"/> season after the long winter; and a thousand merry
                  robins flew about, with red breasts shaken by melodious chirpings, and brilliant
                  plumage burnished by the sunlight.</p>
               <p>Every thing was bright with the youthful joy of spring, and as Mr. St. John and
                  his friend dismounted before the old mansion, the very walls upon which the waving
                  shadows of a thousand leaves were thrown seemed smiling, and prepared to greet
                  them; the open portal held imaginary arms of welcome to them.</p>
               <p>Before this portal stood,—its old form basking pleasantly in the sunshine,—the
                  roomy, low-swung family chariot, with its four long-tailed grays, as ancient, very
                  nearly, as itself, and showing by their well-conditioned forms and glossy manes
                  the results of tranquil, easy living. By their side stood the old white-haired
                  negro driver, time out of mind the family coachman of the Vanes; and in the person
                  of this worthy African gentleman a similar mode of living was unmistakably
                  indicated. Old Cato had evidently little desire to be a censor; sure of his own
                  high position, and quite easy on the subject of the purity of the family blood, he
                  was plainly satisfied with his lot, and had no desire to change the order of
                  things. In his own opinion he was himself one of the family—a portion of the
                  manor, a character of respectability and importance.</p>
               <p>Old Cato greeted the young gentlemen with familiar but respectful courtesy, and
                  received their cordial shakes of the hand with evident pleasure. The horses even
                  seemed to look for personal greeting, and when the young man passed his hand over
                  their necks, they turned their intelligent heads and whinnied gently in token of
                  recognition.</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John patted their coats familiarly, and called them by name, and looking
                  up to the old house said, smiling,</p>
               <p>"Welcome, Vanely! The month I 've been away seems a whole century. After all, the
                  town is nothing like the country, and no other part of it 's like Vanely!"</p>

               <head type="sub">BONNYBEL VANE.</head>
               <p>THE young men entered the familiar old hall and then passed to the comfortable
                  sitting room, where Tom Alston subsided languidly into an easy chair.</p>
               <p>"Stay here till I return, Tom," said St. John; "I 'm going to salute my respected
                  aunt, and will announce our arrival to anybody else I see."</p>
               <p>"Give my compliments to Miss Anybody Else," said Tom.</p>
               <p>But his friend did not hear him. He ran out, ascended the broad oaken stair-case,
                  three steps at a time, with the gayety of a boy, and threw open the door of the
                  chamber immemorably the haunt of good Aunt Mabel.</p>
               <p>The consequence was a collision with a lovely girl who had been combing her hair,
                  apparently, before the mirror, as the profuse brown curls were hanging down on her
                  bare white shoulders and silken dress,—presenting to the eyes of Mr. Harry St.
                  John a mass of shadowy, waving gold, which charmed him.</p>
               <p>The girl no sooner caught sight of the young man, or rather found their faces in
                  collision, than she uttered a scream, and crying "Good gracious! me!" quickly
                  retreated, and slammed the door in his face.</p>
               <p>St. John burst into a fit of laughter and cried, gayly,</p>
               <p>"Let me in, Bonny!"</p>
               <p>"I won't!" cried the girl's voice vivaciously, accompanied by the sound of a key
                  hastily turned in the lock.</p>
               <p>Then the following observations ensued, mingled with laughter:</p>
               <p>"I think you might, Bonny; I want to see aunt."</p>
               <p>"She 's not here! there, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Why, this is her room."</p>
               <p>"It is not! Mamma has moved down stairs."</p>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6146-00000030"/>
               <p>"Oh! she has! But I want to see you, too. I think, after being away so long, you
                  might at least shake hands."</p>
               <p>"Shake hands! humph!" said the girl's voice, very expressively. "I think kissing
                  me was quite enough, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Kissing you!" cried St. John, with well affected surprise.</p>
               <p>"Yes! you know you did, and it was just like your presumption!"</p>
               <p>"You astonish me! Did I kiss you? If I did it was wholly accidental. But how long
                  will it be before you come down? Pray, make haste!"</p>
               <p>The girl's smothered laughter was heard.</p>
               <p>"You do n't deserve it, you odious fellow!" she said, after a pause; "but wait! I
                  'll open in a minute."</p>
               <p>And at the expiration of the appointed time, the key was turned in the lock, and
                  Miss Bonnybel Vane, for that was her name, opened the door. She had hastily
                  arranged her hair, some curls of which were still falling carelessly, however, on
                  the bare round shoulders. They did not detract from her beauty.</p>
               <p>"Where in the world did you come from?" she said, giving him her hand. "You
                  frightened me nearly to death, sir, and you dared to kiss me!"</p>
               <p>"Did I? Well, it is not the first time."</p>
               <p>"Humph!" as before, very expressively.</p>
               <p>"It was by accident," said St. John, laughing, "and I will make you as many
                  apologies as you wish, to say nothing of as many compliments."</p>
               <p>"Thank you!" cried the girl, pouting satirically as she made a mock curtsey, "I do
                  n't want any of your compliments."</p>
               <p>"Then you are the first young lady I ever knew who did not."</p>
               <p>"My Lord Harry is still severe upon our sex, I see—very smart, indeed!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>My Lord Harry!</emph> How familiar the foolish old nick-name sounds. I love
                  every thing about old times, though."</p>
               <p>"Do you? But when did your lordship arrive?"</p>
               <p>"This moment, with Tom Alston."</p>
               <p>"Oh! then we 're to have a double pleasure! The lieutenant of his Excellency's
                  guards, and the fine gentleman, above all others, of the colony! And just to
                  think! my goodness! to appear before such company with my hair down! Will you wait
                  a minute while I fix it, my lord?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed, and look on too."</p>
               <p>The girl did not seem to mind this in the least, but running back to the mirror,
                  gathered up her curls, and quickly secured them with a tortoise-shell comb. She
                  then affixed a bow of scarlet ribbon, added a loop of pearls, and turning round
                  with a demure air, said,</p>
               <p>"How do you like me?"</p>
               <p>St. John tried to make a jesting reply, but failed. The little elf looked so
                  lovely, standing with a vagrant gleam of sunlight on her head, which was inclined
                  coquettishly over one shoulder, that her companion's fun disappeared. For a moment
                  he gazed at her in silence, and we shall embrace the opportunity to make an
                  outline sketch of the little beauty—our heroine.</p>
               <p>Bonnybel Vane is a sparkling, mischievous little maiden of about seventeen. She
                  has a slender, but elegantly rounded figure, a clear white complexion, with two
                  fresh roses blooming in her cheeks; red, pouting lips, large bright eyes of a deep
                  violet, which seem ready to melt or fire under the long dusky lashes, and a
                  profusion of light brown hair, as soft as silk.</p>
               <p>The face is oval, of that pure-blooded Norman type which fascinated the kings and
                  princes of the middle ages, and led to so many bitter feuds and bloody wars. The
                  beautiful, mischievous-looking head is placed upon a swan-like neck, and inclines
                  toward one of the snowy shoulders.</p>
               <p>As to the expression of the girl's features, we can not describe it. The brilliant
                  violet eyes are ready to dance with merriment and mischief, or swim in the dews of
                  feeling; the lips are mobile, prepared to contract, like crumpled rose-leaves<pb
                     n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6146-00000031"/> leaves, with demure amusement at some
                  jest, or, half-parted, to express a world of pity and pathos. Bonnybel is a
                  striking type of the woman of the South, as opposed to the pale, calm, statuesque
                  beauty of more northern countries; she is brimful of feeling, of impulse,
                  mischief, coquettish wildness; indeed, but for the impropriety of the
                  illustration— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l rend="ti-3">"——it sounds ill,</l>
                        <l>But there 's no wrong at bottom—rather praise"—</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> we should say that she resembles a "thorough-bred" young race-horse of the
                  most elegant proportions and the purest "blood."</p>
               <p>She is clad in a pink dress, looped back with bows of ribbon, a close-fitting,
                  square-cut bodice; and a frill of rich lace runs around the neck, and appears
                  beneath the short sleeves, which leave the arms of the girl bare almost to the
                  shoulders. She wears red coral bracelets clasped with gold, and her arms are of
                  dazzling whiteness.</p>
               <p>In reply to her question, "How do you like me?" St. John at last, when he has
                  recovered from his trance of admiration, replies that he likes her more than he
                  can tell.</p>
               <p>"Your arms are especially beautiful, Bonny," he says. "Do you use cosmetics?"</p>
               <p>"Cosmetics! indeed! No, sir, I do not!" she cried, with indignation. "Nature made
                  them as they are!"</p>
               <p>"I wish nature had given them to me."</p>
               <p>"To you? Pray, what would you do with them?"</p>
               <p>"I would clasp them round my neck," said the young man; "though I know about fifty
                  young gentlemen who would like, in that event, to put an end to my existence."</p>
               <p>"A very pretty speech!" cries Bonnybel, with a dangerous glance of her coquettish
                  eyes; "please inform me what romance you have been reading lately."</p>
               <p>"None. I have not had time. I have been thinking."</p>
               <p>"Thinking of what?"</p>
               <p>"Of reality—suppose I say of you, Bonny?"</p>
               <p>And the young man, losing his tone of jesting satire, almost most sighs.
                  Bonnybel's quick ear catches the sound perfectly, and the change of tone. But she
                  does not betray the fact in the least. On the contrary, she laughs carelessly and
                  says:</p>
               <p>"Of me? Good gracious! is it possible you have time to think of your little
                  country cousin in the midst of your arduous toils, parading and marching?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," replies St. John, looking with honest fondness straight into the girl's
                  eyes, "I thought of you often. Ah! my dear, a young man can not be so much with
                  his 'little cousin,' as you say, when she is as sweet as you, Bonny, and then
                  master his thoughts. I dream of you sometimes, and 't is a lovely, laughing little
                  fairy I see in my dreams."</p>
               <p>"Excellent! You have certainly been reading romances! Gracious! I a fairy. I
                  suppose you'll call me an angel next. Thank you, sir, but I 'm sorry to say I am
                  neither. I am only a country girl, made of flesh and blood, with a fine appetite,
                  a quick temper, and a fondness for every thing like a frolic—there, sir!—and
                  a—"</p>
               <p>"Warm, true heart, in spite of your mischievous ways!" added St. John, returning
                  to his light tone of jest. "Oh, I know you very well, Bonny—may be too well. I
                  mean that I had better have not seen so much of you; but let us go to aunt."</p>
               <p>He took her hand, and Bonnybel, who had rapidly glanced at his face, yielded it
                  without a word. The little beauty, with the quick instinct of her sex, had already
                  discovered the state of her cousin's feelings—the secret of the power she could
                  exert over him. The further progress of our narrative will show whether the young
                  lady's calculations were or were not correct.</p>
               <p>They rapidly descended the stair-case, hand in hand, and Bonnybel, quietly
                  extricating herself, led the way to a room in the rear, the door of which she
                  opened.</p>
               <p>In a moment Mr. St. John found himself affectionately embraced by a pair of thin
                  arms, and received a kiss. Aunt Mabel sat in her old chair, thin, erect, clad in
                  black silk, a<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6146-00000032"/> snowy handkerchief pinned
                  across her bosom; her scant gray hair neatly gathered beneath the plaits of her
                  full lace cap. The old lady was busy knitting, casting from time to time a glance
                  at a little negro girl, who was taking her first lessons in coarse sewing, on a
                  cricket at her mistress' feet. At the distance of six paces, a chambermaid was
                  knitting rough stockings, and, in the corner, an old negro woman, with her head
                  tied up in a white cloth, assiduously plied the shears in cutting out clothes for
                  the household.</p>
               <p>Aunt Mabel received her nephew with great affection, and made him give her all the
                  news.</p>
               <p>"Well, well," she said at last, "I 'm glad to see you in such good health and
                  spirits, nephew. Still, you were best here attending to your interests."</p>
               <p>"I think so, too, aunt," said the young man, looking toward Bonnybel, who was
                  powdering her hair at the mirror, with a little round cushion of swansdown; "and
                  what does Miss Bonnybel think on the subject?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Sir?</emph>" said the young lady, turning round; "did you speak to me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"What did you say?"</p>
               <p>"Then our conversation is inaudible—is it?" he said, with a smile. "I was only
                  telling aunt that I thought I had best come back to the old county and remain
                  here. I think there's nothing like the beauty of our fields in the whole wide
                  world, aunt. To be a country gentleman after all seems to me a worthier ambition
                  than to bow my knee before the grandest royalty of Europe. The sight of the fields
                  yonder, where I played in boyhood, makes me a boy again; and," he added, with a
                  smile, "I have the pleasure of meeting one of my old playmates."</p>
               <p>"You mean Bonny, I suppose, Harry," says Aunt Mabel, knitting busily. "Yes, she
                  often says 't is not so merry when you are away—your laugh is wanting."</p>
               <p>Miss Bonnybel turned quickly, having suddenly finished her occupation.</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> said!—mamma!—I only meant—"</p>
               <p>"That Columbine did n't enjoy herself without Harlequin!" said the young man. "I
                  'm glad you 've suddenly found your ears, Miss Columbine!"</p>
               <p>"Thank you, sir!" said Bonnybel, curtesying with mock ceremony, and pouting
                  satirically, "I suppose you think that 's very smart and fine! O! goodness
                  gracious!" suddenly cried the young lady, relapsing into laughter, "there 's all
                  my hair come down!"</p>
               <p>In truth the ardor of the damsel in turning her head had produced the result
                  indicated, and her snowy shoulders were again covered by the profuse brown
                  curls.</p>
               <p>"Let me assist you," said St. John, raising a mass of curls and smiling.</p>
               <p>"No, if you please, sir!" cried the girl, drawing back; "you would make a bad
                  lady's maid, and I 'd rather not!"</p>
               <p>"Then I'll go see Aunt Seraphina and Cousin Helen," said St. John, and with these
                  words he descended to the sitting-room.</p>
               <p>It was a large apartment, decorated, after the fashion of the period, with carved
                  wainscoting, and hung around with many portraits of old gentlemen in powder, and
                  fair dames floating in translucent clouds of saffron lace. High-backed chairs
                  stood about in picturesque disorder, and upon a table, with crooked legs, were a
                  number of volumes in embossed leather, tossed about at random. An embroidery frame
                  stood in one corner, upon which a lady was then working, the design of her picture
                  being Amyntor, in red stockings, and a blue hat, with snowy feathers, playing upon
                  a Spanish mandolin, beneath the window of Amoret. An old sideboard, with some
                  silver plate on it, a little table, covered with china figures and grotesque
                  vessels of that hideous description fashionable at the period, and, between the
                  windows looking on the lawn, an old harpsichord, tall, stately, and
                  antique—completed the accessories of the apartment in which Mr. St. John now found
                  himself.</p>
               <p>Miss Seraphina, sister of Colonel Vane, and a lady of uncertain<pb n="64-65"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000033"/> certain age, was working at the embroidery frame
                  with sentimental smiles, as Mr. Tom Alston exchanged compliments; and Mr. St. John
                  had scarcely gotten through his greetings when Miss Helen Vane made her
                  appearance, her waist encircled by the arm of Miss Bonnybel, a pretty picture
                  which young ladies have affected in all ages. Miss Helen is a handsome brunette of
                  about twenty, with dark hair, dark eyes, and an air of serenity which seems
                  incapable of change. She is erect and somewhat stately in the carriage of her full
                  and handsome person, clad in rich black, rustling silk, and the faint smile which
                  wanders from time to time over her countenance, scarcely relaxes this prevailing
                  expression of collected calmness.</p>
               <p>When Mr. St. John essays to "salute" Miss Helen, she draws back, turning away her
                  head, and the young man is obliged to content himself with a salute bestowed upon
                  the ribband of her head dress.</p>
               <p>We have thus attempted to outline two young ladies who were great toasts in their
                  day—especially the younger maiden, Miss Bonnybel, whose brilliant eyes, and lovely
                  face, with those of her companions, illustrated so finely the times in which they
                  moved. Yet who can paint them? cries our good author, breaking forth, as is his
                  wont, into raptures. Who can even so much as outline them truly, those tender
                  little dames of the Virginia past? They shine upon us now like stars, glimmering
                  far away on the blue horizon of the elder day, withdrawing, as we gaze, their
                  ineffectual fires, and fainting in the garish sunlight of the present. It is easy
                  to tell of the looped-back gown, and all the rich furbelows and flounces, with
                  streaming ribbon knots; the red Spanish shoes, the clocks on the stockings, the
                  lace around shoulders like the driven snow, or the powder that lies, like that
                  snow, on the hair—the dark or bright hair, the raven or the golden! But alas!
                  these are only the externals. There is something beneath all this which still
                  escapes us, which we vainly attempt to grasp or describe. Mild and serene, there
                  was yet something bright and ardent in these natures which we do not see to-day!
                  The blossom on the bough, the spray on the wave, the dew on the grass—something
                  fresh, and natural, and indescribable! A grace which we can not express, which
                  flits when we try to embrace it—the shadow of a shadow!</p>

               <p>THE party of young people are laughing and talking with immense assiduity, when a
                  door in the hall is heard to open, a species of growl resounds, and Helen and
                  Bonnybel say, at the same moment, "There 's papa!"</p>
               <p>The young men rise, and at the same moment old Colonel Vane appears at the door,
                  and cries in a cheery voice,</p>
               <p>"Good morrow, Tom, and welcome, Captain Harry! When did you turn up, and where
                  from?"</p>
               <p>"Tom came with me from town, uncle," says Mr. St. John, shaking the fat hand, "how
                  is your health?"</p>
               <p>"So so—so so! I think the devil's in this foot, Harry! I might sit for the
                  portrait of Old Gouty!"</p>
               <p>And the rubicund old gentleman laughed and grimaced. There was much truth in his
                  declaration. Never did gout attack a more suitable subject. Colonel Vane was an
                  old fellow of about sixty, with a portly person, one foot wrapped in bandages,
                  while the other was encased in a neat buckled shoe, and silk stocking, and his
                  costume indicated one well to do in the world, and fond of his ease. His powdered
                  hair was gathered in a queue behind, his ruffles were huge and spotless, and the
                  gold-headed cane which he carried had evidently found its way to Virginia from the
                  shop of a London maker. With this cane he half supported himself, though he seemed
                  greatly to prefer the soft shoulders of Misses Helen and Bonnybel, who hastened to
                  his side.</p>
               <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6146-00000034"/>
               <p>Had Addison seen the old fellow thus smiling and making wry faces at the enemy in
                  his foot, the worthy colonel would have been immortalized in a number of the
                  Spectator, and it is more than probable that Hogarth, or one of the later
                  humorists of the town, would have drawn him in the character of an East Indian
                  director limping forth to his coach, after a dinner at the Lord Mayor's, irascible
                  with the gout, and still growling at the insolence of the American rebels, who had
                  tossed the Company's tea overboard in the harbor of Boston.</p>
               <p>"Youth's a fine thing!" said the jolly old colonel, smiling at the party, "and I
                  enjoyed my own. There! there! my dear—softly!"</p>
               <p>And the colonel commenced moving toward the chariot.</p>
               <p>"I am going to the county court," he said, "that is if this cursed gout will let
                  me! My old enemy, boys," added the worthy; "and like a scolding wife, has ever the
                  last word! 'T is enough to make a man swear; but I won't. I must get on and see to
                  that road to the river; the girls will take care of you—there! there! easy, my
                  dear!"</p>
               <p>And the colonel stepped upon the portico, still supported by the girls.</p>
               <p>"Come here you old rascal!" he cried to Cato; "give me your arm!"</p>
               <p>Old Cato, in a measured and deliberate way, abandoned the horses, and approached
                  his master. The colonel, however, desired that Cato should rush rapidly toward
                  him, and the deliberate pace of the old negro caused him to flourish his cane and
                  swear.</p>
               <p>Cato did not hasten his steps, however. He seemed to think that he as well as his
                  master had rights, and moreover, was convinced from long experience that the cane
                  would not descend upon his shoulders. The event proved his good sense—he preserved
                  his personal dignity and lost nothing.</p>
               <p>"Look at the old dog!" said the colonel; "he presumes upon my good nature and
                  takes his time. Come, you abandoned old wretch! There! take care of the foot!
                  easy!"</p>
               <p>And leaning upon Cato, the old gentleman reached the chariot, and was comfortably
                  deposited within upon the soft cushions. The young girls bade him good-bye, with a
                  kiss; and old Cato having received an intimation from the colonel that he would
                  thrash him on his return, if he drove faster than a slow walk, the chariot rolled
                  away over the smooth gravel at a brisk trot, and was soon out of sight.</p>
               <p>It had scarcely disappeared behind the foliage, when half a dozen ladies and
                  gentlemen on horseback appeared at the outer gate, and mounted the hill at full
                  gallop. They dismounted before the house in the midst of a joyful clatter, and a
                  shower of kisses, and Miss Bonnybel seemed ready to dance with delight at the
                  anticipation of a frolic.</p>

               <head type="sub">A MAY MORNING IN '74.</head>
               <p>OUR history will not admit of a detailed description of the events of the day at
                  Vanely, else should we take pleasure in relating how the gallants in ruffles and
                  powder paid assiduous court to the damsels in hoops and furbelows; how laughter
                  and sighs, bright glances and jests, with incessant rattling on the old
                  harpsichord, filled the morning.</p>
               <p>Many songs were sang, and in truth—says our good author, full of admiration, as
                  usual, of the damsels—there was rarest music in those girlish voices caroling the
                  tender or gay ditties of the past. The ardent love of faithful shepherds for the
                  dearest shepherdesses sang in their madrigals, and all was love and sunshine,
                  laughter, merriment and joy. Sparkling eyes lent point and brilliancy to jests
                  from rosy lips; and all was May in the old house, whose very portraits seemed to
                  smile and say, "Be happy while 't is May!"</p>
               <p>At last the gay sunshine drew them to the lawn, and soon they were wandering
                  across the flowery grass, and under<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6146-00000035"/> the
                  old century oaks—a merry party, brilliant as the flowers which the little maidens
                  really resembled in their variegated dresses, and communicating to the grounds of
                  the old homestead new attraction.<ref rend="super" target="#note_005"
                     xml:id="return_005">*</ref>

               </note>
               <p>The birds sang merrily above their heads, flitting from tree to tree across the
                  mild blue; the apple blossoms lay upon the boughs like fragrant snow, and the
                  fresh river breezes, bearing on their wings the odor of the sea, blew on the
                  tender foreheads, and made every cheek more rosy, and ran through the branches
                  overhead, dancing and singing, and then died away, a musical murmur, mingling with
                  the carol of the maidens like a symphony from airy harps.</p>
               <p>And suddenly in a dell of the forest, or rather beneath a knoll of the lawn, they
                  came <unclear>upon a</unclear> very pleasing device of Miss Bonnybel's—nothing
                  less than a most tempting array of edibles scattered in picturesque confusion on
                  the grass. Heavy slices of fruit-cake piled themselves up or lay in masses;
                  cut-glass dishes scarcely held the golden mountains of cool jellies; bottles of
                  the colonel's finest sherry rolled about, like topers overcome with liquor, in the
                  grass; and in the center a huge round of beef flanked with cold fowls and ham,
                  twinkled in light and shadow, as the boughs of the great oak moved with the
                  breeze.</p>
               <p>Laughing like children at the pleasant surprise, the young men and maidens hasten
                  to the spot, and the attack commences very vigorously.</p>
               <p>It is a scene from "As You Like it," or of Robin Hood's day, or such as Watteau
                  liked to place on canvas.</p>
               <p>Seated on the emerald sward, in attitudes of careless ease and graceful abandon,
                  with saffron laces around snowy arms, and silken dresses emulating tulip beds, and
                  small hands grasping slender glasses filled with gold, and merry laughter at a
                  thousand jests—thus scattered over the lawn, beneath the rustling boughs of the
                  old oak, the party make a little Arcady for themselves, without a cloud, filled
                  full with sunshine.</p>
               <p>"'T is really charming," says Tom Alston, who, having finished his repast, gently
                  smoothes his ruffles with one hand, holding a glass of sherry in the other; "'t is
                  quite a sylvan scene, from one of the pastorals, of Mr. Pope, say."</p>
               <p>"Or Theocritus," adds a young gentleman recently from college.</p>
               <p>"Yes," says Mr. Alston, "and reminds me of a similar scene, when I was a young
                  fellow, in Effingham woods."</p>
               <p>"When Kate Effingham was your sweetheart," cries Bonnybel, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Really—ahem!—really now," replies Mr. Alston, modestly, "I prefer not alluding to
                  these subjects, but I believe that most charming young lady did have some regard
                  for me."</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston looks more modest than ever, and adds,</p>
               <p>"I, however, resigned her to my friend, Will Effingham—sacrificed myself on the
                  altar of friendship—they are now married."</p>
               <p>General laughter greets this communication, and a smile even wanders over the
                  countenance of Helen. The laughter does not embarrass Mr. Alston, who says,</p>
               <p>"On that agreeable occasion, Miss Kate sang a charming song—'I 'm o'er young to
                  marry yet;' also another, which methinks no poet has surpassed—'There lives a lass
                  upon the green.'"</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston's talent is well known, and he is besieged to sing. He receives the
                  proposal with surprise, declares he has a cold—protests he can not. At the end of
                  ten minutes, however, he is singing in a voice of great melody. This is his song: <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"There lives a lass upon the green;</l>

                        <l>A brighter nymph was never seen;</l>
                        <l>She looks and reigns a little queen,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">And keeps the swains in awe.</l>

                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"Her eyes are Cupid's darts and wings,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Her eyebrows are his bow,</l>
                        <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6146-00000036"/>
                        <l>Her silken hair the silver strings,</l>
                        <l>Which swift and sure destruction brings</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">To all the vale below.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"If Pastorella's dawn of light</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Can warm and wound us so,</l>
                        <l>Her noon must be so piercing bright</l>
                        <l>Each glancing beam would kill outright,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">And every swain subdue!"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Much applause follows, and Mr. Alston raises his glass—</p>
               <p>"I have the honor of drinking the health of our hostess, Pastorella," he says,
                  bowing to Bonnybel.</p>
               <p>The young lady rises, and makes a low and demure curtesy, endeavoring to smother
                  her laughter, caused by the languishing expression of Mr. Alston. It bursts forth,
                  however, and all join in the merry peal.</p>
               <p>At the same moment, a distant cannon booms across the fields, and every one
                  starts. Bonnybel claps her hands and cries that it is Captain Fellowes, of the
                  "Charming Sally," with all the new London dresses! She has seen his arrival at
                  York in the Gazette, and he always fires his swivel at the landings!</p>
               <p>Miss Bonnybel's excitement about the new dresses is contagious, and in fifteen
                  minutes the entire party of young ladies, accompanied by their cavaliers, are
                  galloping toward the Vanely wharf.</p>
               <p>The "Charming Sally" has gone aground, owing to low water, at some distance from
                  the piers running out into the river, but the large boat, always lying below the
                  old warehouse, is put in requisition, and, propelled by two stalwart and grinning
                  Africans, the craft plunges her cutwater into the current, and lands the party on
                  the vessel.</p>
               <p>Captain Fellowes is a good-humored old tar, and meets the young people with the
                  air of an old acquaintance. To Miss Bonnybel's excited question as to her dresses,
                  the old fellow replies by lugging down his book of entries, smiling, and the young
                  lady having come to <hi rend="i"/>V, reads aloud hurriedly—</p>
               <p>"Colonel Vane—Vanely Landing—Prince George—casks Canary—boxes Zante
                  currants—oranges Barcelona—Lucca olives—saddles—harness—volumes in leather,
                  namely—gowns from Madam Fenton—over against—"</p>
               <p>"Here it is!" cries Miss Bonnybel; "look, Helen! every thing we sent for!"</p>
               <p>Helen smiles—she is less enthusiastic.</p>
               <p>"O thank you, Captain Fellowes!" cries Bonnybel; "you must not laugh at me for my
                  noise, for you know I 'm not one of the lords of creation. Please send these boxes
                  at once to the house, and papa's Canary for dinner, if he comes back."</p>
               <p>To all this, Captain Fellowes growled a good-humored assent, and then the party,
                  having scattered themselves over the vessel, and satisfied their curiosity by
                  inspecting every thing, reëntered the boat and were rowed back to the wharf.</p>
               <p>But not to the sons or the daughters of men, come days without a cloud—unalloyed
                  pleasure—the rose without the obstinate thorn.</p>
               <p>Bonnybel and her cousin were the last to leave the boat. With dancing eyes, and
                  bright cheeks, rosy with pleasure, the young lady hastened to ascend the wharf.
                  But unhappy to relate, her slipper was placed much too carelessly upon the smooth
                  gunwale; the boat swayed, and slipping first upon her knee, then wholly, Miss
                  Bonnybel was precipitated into the river.</p>
               <p>We need scarcely say that she rose from the waves in the arms of Mr. St. John, who
                  gallantly rescued her.</p>
               <p>A dozen frightened faces and eager hands were immediately stretched out, and the
                  young lady stood safely upon the wharf; but with a direful change in her
                  appearance. Her hair had fallen upon her shoulders, and streamed with water; her
                  furbelows had disappeared, and a small foot clad in a white silk stocking, from
                  which the shoe had been lost, peered from her skirt, from which a flood of
                  moisture descended.</p>
               <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6146-00000037"/>
               <p>"Oh me!" cried the young lady, leaning upon one of her companions, "how did I fall
                  into the water?"</p>
               <p>"Very gracefully," replied St. John.</p>
               <p>"And you saved me!"</p>
               <p>"In the most heroic manner," replied the young man, wringing his wet sleeves, "and
                  I know you are too much of a heroine to mind it."</p>
               <p>"I do n't," said Miss Bonnybel, laughing and blushing as she drew back her foot;
                  "but, oh goodness, I 've lost my shoe!"</p>
               <p>It was brought as she spoke, by a negro who had fished it out; and Mr. St. John
                  most gallantly replaced it upon the foot. It was doubtless owing to the moist
                  state of the stocking that he consumed about twice as much time as was
                  necessary.</p>
               <p>The ceremony was concluded at last, however, and then the young man would have
                  sent for a carriage, but Bonnybel would not hear of it. She declared that the
                  accident was nothing; she could return upon horseback as she came; and mounting
                  with laughter into the saddle, she galloped off with her hair streaming, followed
                  by the other young ladies, and the gallants, who declared that she was a heroine,
                  and "full of pluck."</p>
               <p>We shall not pause to discuss the question, but proceed to relate that they soon
                  reached Vanely; that Miss Bonnybel was forced to partake largely of artificial
                  spirits by good Aunt Mabel, and that the young lady thereafter put on one of the
                  London dresses which punctual Captain Fellowes had just sent from the vessel, and
                  flirting an enormous fan, swept up and down the room with all the mincing languor
                  of a lady of the court, to the great enjoyment of the young ladies, her
                  companions, who greeted the exhibition with much laughter.</p>
               <p>They had then a great dinner, at which sunset surprised them; and so the day was
                  done; but not the merry-making.</p>

               <p>MR. HARRY ST. JOHN changed his wet dress, and having taken a last survey of
                  himself in the mirror, issued forth and descended the stair-case.</p>
               <p>At the bottom step, he paused and leaned upon the banister.</p>
               <p>A portrait hanging high up on the old wall, among the powdered heads and snowy
                  bosoms of the Vane family, has attracted his attention.</p>
               <p>It is a picture of Bonnybel, taken in her fifteenth year, when the London artist
                  came to Williamsburg, and turned his skill to golden account among the gentlemen
                  and ladies of the colony. The little maiden looks lovely on the canvas, in her
                  pretty costume of silk, and lace, and ribbons; her sunny hair descending upon
                  plump white shoulders; her mischievous eyes and rosy cheeks peering forth as it
                  were from the brown curls. She caresses with her dimpled hand the head of a shaggy
                  little lapdog, and looks into the beholder's face with a mixture of mirth and
                  tenderness.</p>
               <p>"'T is a wonderful art," mutters the young man, "and there 's the very face I've
                  loved to look on for many a day—full of wild mischief, and yet tender. 'T would
                  make quite a story for the pastoral romances!—the history of my life!—and now I
                  wish to go away and fight the Indians!</p>
               <p>"Tom's right after all," he continued. "I doubtless put on the plume of war to
                  dazzle the eyes of <emph>somebody!</emph> I believe I am falling regularly in
                  love; but what will be the issue I do n't know. Well, patience and shuffle the
                  cards, as Tom says; who knows what will happen?"</p>
               <p>"Suppose now you look a minute at the original," said a voice at his elbow. St.
                  John turns quickly and sees the vivacious Miss Bonnybel, decked out for the
                  evening, at his side.</p>
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6146-00000038"/>
               <p>"But if I prefer the portrait?" he replies; "it reminds me of old times."</p>
               <p>"When I was a child, I suppose, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Yes; and when you loved me more than now."</p>
               <p>"Who said I did not love you now?" asked the girl, with a coquettish glance.</p>
               <p>"Do you?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly. I love you dearly—you and all my cousins."</p>
               <p>St. John sighed, and then laughed; but he said nothing, and offering his arm, led
                  the girl into the sitting-room.</p>
               <p>The young girls, whilst awaiting the appearance of Cæsar, the violin player, from
                  the "quarters," amused themselves writing their names, after a fashion very
                  prevalent in Virginia, upon the panes of the windows. For this purpose they made
                  use of diamond rings, or, better still, the long, sharp-pointed crystals known as
                  "Virginia diamonds."</p>
               <p>With these the gallants found no difficulty in inscribing the names of their
                  sweethearts, with all the flourishes of a writing-master, on the glass, and very
                  soon the glittering tablets were scrawled over with Lucies and Fannies, and a
                  brilliant genius of the party even executed some fine profile portraits.</p>
               <p>Those names have remained there for nearly a century, and when afterwards the
                  persons who traced them looked with age-dimmed eyes upon the lines, the dead day
                  rose again before them, and its forms appeared once more, laughing and joyous, as
                  at Vanely on that evening. And not here only may these memorials of another age be
                  found; in a hundred Virginia houses they speak of the past.</p>
               <p>Yes, yes, says our author, those names on the panes of Vanely are a spell! They
                  sound with a strange music, a bright wonder in the ears of their descendants!
                  Frail chronicle! how you bring up the brilliant eyes again, the jest and the
                  glance, the joy and the laughter, the splendor and beauty which flashed onward,
                  under other skies, in the old Virginia, dead to us so long! As I gaze on your
                  surfaces, bright panes of Vanely, I fancy with what sparkling eyes the names were
                  traced. I see in a dream, as it were, the soft white hand which laid its cushioned
                  palm on this glittering tablet; I see the rich dresses, the bending necks, the
                  figures gracefully inclined as the maidens leaned over to write "Lucy," and
                  "Fanny," and "Nelly," and "Frances," and "Kate;" I see the curls and the powder,
                  the furbelows and flounces, the ring on the finger, the lace on the arm—poor lace
                  that was yellow indeed by the snow it enveloped! I see, no less clearly, the forms
                  of the gallants, those worthy young fellows in ruffles and fairtops; I see all the
                  smiles, and the laughter, and love. All is very plain, and I mutter, "Fair dames
                  and cavaliers, what 's become of all your laughter and sighing—your mirth, and
                  bright eyes, and high pride? Did you think that all generations but your own were
                  mortal? that the sun would always shine, the music ever sound, the roses on your
                  cheeks never wither? You had pearls in your hair, and your lips were carnations;
                  the pearls may remain, but the carnations, where are they? O beautiful figures of
                  a dead generation! you are phantoms only. You are all gone, and your laces have
                  faded or are moth-eaten; you are silent now, and still, and the minuet bows no
                  more; you are dimly remembered laughter, the heroines of a tale that is told—you
                  live on a window pane only!" Old panes! it is the human story that I read in
                  you—the legend of a generation, and of all generations! For what are the records
                  of earth and its actors but frost-work on a pane, or these scratches of a diamond
                  which a blow shatters. A trifle may shiver the tablet and strew it in the dust!
                  There is only one record, one tablet, where the name which is written lives for
                  ever; it is not in this world, 't is beyond the stars!</p>
               <p>"O there 's Uncle Cæsar!" cries Bonnybel, "and we 'll have a dance!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, a dance!"</p>
               <p>"O yes!"</p>
               <p>"How do you do, Uncle Cæsar?"</p>
               <p>"A minuet first!"</p>
               <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6146-00000039"/>
               <p>These are some of the outcries which resound through the apartment as an old
                  gray-haired African appears at the door, and removing his fox-tail cap, louts low
                  before the animated throng.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">HOW THEY DANCED A MINUET DE LA COUR.</head>
               <p>WE linger for a moment to look upon the divertisements of that old, old land—the
                  far away colonial Virginia. It is all gone from us, and, as says our worthy
                  author, the minuet bows no longer, but it shall bow in our history as it did
                  before. A narrative, such as we write, should not only flow on like a stream
                  toward its termination, it should also mirror on its surface the bright scenes it
                  passes through—the banks, the skies, the flowers of other years, all should be
                  painted on the ever moving current.</p>
               <p>Therefore we pause a moment to look on the minuet, to listen to old Uncle Cæsar's
                  fiddle, to hear the long-drawn music wind its liquid cadences through mellow
                  variations, and to see the forms and faces of the young men and the maidens.</p>
               <p>They have a quadrille first, and then a couple take the floor.</p>
               <p>St. John leans on the carved back of Bonnybel's chair, and makes himself generally
                  agreeable.</p>
               <p>"How gracefully the girls of Virginia dress," he says; "like butterflies, all blue
                  and gold, and—down."</p>
               <p>"Butterflies indeed!" cries the young lady, "and pray what do the gentlemen
                  resemble—wasps?"</p>
               <p>"No; working bees."</p>
               <p>"Drones rather!"</p>
               <p>"What a wit you have!" says Mr. St. John, laughing; "but, really now, just see.
                  Consider these lilies of the parlor lor, they toil not, neither do they spin, like
                  their grand-mothers."</p>
               <p>"I do, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Then you are different. The young ladies do n't sew or spin, they engage Mr. Pate
                  or Mrs. Hunter to relieve them of it."</p>
               <p>"Pray, what do you know of Mr. Pate?"</p>
               <p>"I know what I read," says St. John, taking up, with a smile, the "Virginia
                  Gazette;" "see here the notice that Master Matthew Pate has for sale, 'Stays, twin
                  and single; jumps, half-bow stays, stays made to buckle before, pin or button,' no
                  doubt with diamond studs, like yours, madam!"</p>
               <p>"You are extremely wise and learned in the female costume; my stays came from
                  London, and l'll thank you—"</p>
               <p>Here the minuet ends, and the particular conversation is lost in the general buzz.
                  It is next Bonnybel's turn, and with a queenly air she says to Mr. St. John, who
                  has engaged her hand,</p>
               <p>"You 'll please ask me to dance formally, sir?"</p>
               <p>St. John smiles, deposits his cocked-hat on his heart, and bowing to the ground,
                  requests the pleasure of a minuet.</p>
               <p>Bonnybel opens her enormous fan, with ivory decorations, places its downy edge
                  upon her chin, and inclining her head sidewise with a die-away expression,
                  declares, simpering, that really the gallants will not let her rest, she 's
                  wearied with attention, but supposes, since my Lord Bolingbroke has asked her
                  hand, she ought not to refuse.</p>
               <p>With these words, and in the midst of general laughter, Miss Bonnybel gives her
                  hand daintily to her partner, and they advance into the floor, to the mellow
                  strains of Uncle Cæsar's fiddle.</p>
               <p>It is a little beauty of the eighteenth century, armed cap-a-pié for conquest,
                  that the current of our story now reflects; the picture will be seen no more in
                  truth, however, unless grandma on the wall yonder, painted at the age of
                  seventeen, steps down and curteseys to us in some reverie or dream.</p>
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6146-00000040"/>
               <p>Bonnybel wears, over a scarlet petticoat, a hooped dress of yellow satin, all
                  furbelowed and decorated, especially with a row of rich rosettes, down to the
                  feet. The bodice is cut square, the waist long and slender; the satin fits closely
                  to the young lady's pliant figure, which is encircled by a silver girdle, and
                  between the silken net-work of red cords, securing the open front, a profusion of
                  saffron lace, kept in its place by diamond studs, dazzles the eye like a heap of
                  new fallen snow tinted with sunset. The sleeves are short, or perhaps it will be
                  more correct to say that the dress has no sleeves at all, the round, dimpled
                  shoulders of the young lady being encircled only, so to speak, by a narrow band of
                  silk; and, last of all, a cloud of gauze floats round the neck and shoulders,
                  reconciling Miss Bonnybel to a pattern which she gazed at somewhat ruefully when
                  it was first unfolded. Blue satin shoes, with slender heels about four inches
                  high, and a light head-dress, principally consisting of a wreath of roses, finish
                  the costume; the young lady having for decoration only a pearl necklace, rising
                  and falling tranquilly.</p>
               <p>As this prettily clad little beauty bowed before him, Mr. St. John thought he had
                  never seen a fairer sight, more dancing eyes, any thing at the same time half so
                  feminine and mischievous. Bonnybel danced exceedingly well; and as she moved in
                  perfect time to the stately music, and bent in the measured curtesey, until her
                  curls fell like a cloud of dusky gold around the rosy cheeks, and her knee touched
                  the floor almost,—thus gliding before him in the fine old dance, and giving him,
                  with dainty ceremony, the tips of her fingers, the young dame made her partner
                  fancy that the most attractive and provoking fairy of Titania's court had come in
                  from the moonlight, and would flit away as she came. He saw her thus curteseying
                  long afterwards, and when an old man, told it to another generation.<ref

               </note>
               <p>So the minuet bowed and curteseyed itself onward through its stately motions, and
                  with a low sigh of satisfaction and self-admiration, died away.</p>
               <p>But the dancing was not over. A reel succeeded. The fiddler exchanged his mellow
                  cadences for spirit-stirring mirth, the tragic symphony gave way to sparkling
                  comedy. Darting, inclining, clasping and unclasping hands, the gay party bore no
                  bad resemblance to a flock of children turned loose for a holiday. Even the
                  stately Helen's "dignity" was overthrown, and Mr. Tom Alston's fine peruke, from
                  Monsieur Lafonge's, filled the whole wide apartment with its perfumed powder.</p>
               <p>For almost an hour thus Uncle Cæsar made the bounding feet keep time to his gay
                  music, and as he approached the end of the performance, the old fiddler seemed to
                  be carried away by the genius of uproar. With head thrown back, eyes rolling in
                  their orbits, and huge foot keeping time to the tune, his bow flashed backward and
                  forward with a wild delight, and the violin roared and burst into shouts of
                  laughter. Quicker yet and ever quicker grew the movements of the "Snow-bird on the
                  ash-bank," the old musician threw his whole soul into the uproarious reel, and the
                  brilliant forms, with dazzling silks and eyes more dazzling still, and rosy
                  cheeks, and laughter, flashed from end to end of the great room, and whirled
                  through mazes, and were borne like variegated foam upon the sparkling waves—those
                  waves of the wild music which roared, and laughed, and shouted over pearls and
                  powder, diamonds and bright eyes, in grandest revelry and furious mirth.</p>
               <p>So reigned the great Cæsar over man and maid, and so, perhaps, the headlong violin
                  would still be playing—but for cruel fate. Suddenly a string snapped, the dance
                  was at an end, and Uncle Cæsar, with a long scrape, put his fiddle under his arm,
                  and made his most impressive bow. The maidens stood still panting and laughing,
                  with undulating forms, and rosy cheeks, and sparkling eyes, and vigorous fannings;
                  and then the reel at an end, they hastily prepared to depart.</p>
               <p>In vain they were pressed to stay; and soon, with a multiplicity of kisses, (then,
                  as now, a favorite amusement of<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6146-00000041"/> young
                  ladies in the presence of young gentlemen,) they fled away into the moonlit
                  forest, with their attendant cavaliers.</p>
               <p>Fair dames! what a pity it is that the pen of him who writes could not adequately
                  paint your joy and beauty, your brilliant eyes, your pearl-looped towers of curls,
                  your dangerous glances—all your sighs, and coquetries and laughter! And if your
                  fair grand-children, following, in an idle moment, their most humble servant's
                  chronicle, cry out with a pretty indignation at the fact, the chronicler can only
                  take his hat off humbly, and bow low, and plead his inability to make the picture;
                  to tell how beautiful those lilies of the past appeared; those lilies and dear
                  roses of Virginia fields; and hope that they are somewhere blooming on Virginia
                  walls—flowers of the years before; but fresh still for us, in imperishable
                  memory!</p>
               <p>St. John and Bonnybel stood on the portico and watched them till they
                  disappeared.</p>
               <p>She must have understood the long ardent look which he fixed upon her face, as she
                  stood thus, bathed in the silver moonlight; but Miss Bonnybel was sleepy and
                  intent on bed.</p>
               <p>Much as she would have liked to promenade with her companion, and tantalize him
                  with her glances, she preferred retiring. So, pursing up her lips toward him, as
                  though she wished to be kissed, she darted away, laughing, and disappeared.</p>
               <p>St. John remained alone, musing by moonlight for an hour, and then also retired to
                  his chamber and his bed. It was to dream of her.</p>

               <head type="sub">WHICH VERIFIES THE PROVERB THAT LISTENERS NEVER HEAR ANY GOOD OF
                  THEMSELVES.</head>
               <p>ON the morning following the scenes just narrated, St. John leaped out of bed at
                  sunrise, and leaving Tom Alston still asleep, dressed quickly, and went down
                  stairs; thence he issued forth upon the lawn, and bent his steps toward the
                  "quarters."</p>
               <p>Here, in all the dignified state of a log cabin of the largest size, his nurse,
                  "Mammy Liza," resided.</p>
               <p>Let it not be a matter of surprise that the lieutenant of his Excellency's guards
                  rose thus early to go and see his nurse. In the South, and more especially in
                  Virginia, that element of society denominated "Mammy," is of no slight importance
                  and dignity.</p>
               <p>This lady is of high aristocratic dignity. She is of the Order of the "Bath"—in
                  reference to the young ladies of the manor house, both of the "Bath" and the
                  "Garter." <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Honi soit qui mal y pense!</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>For her young master, the old African countess preserves an unfailing attachment
                  and a jealous care. All his goings on are criticised with a watchful supervision.
                  Does he perform a generous and noble action? the countess is there to say it is
                  just like her boy. Does he sit up late with reveling blades, and make darkness
                  hideous with tipsy uproar? the countess eloquently extends her arm, assumes a look
                  of outraged virtue, and rates the delinquent soundly—using for the purpose all her
                  vast resources in the art of scolding; and ending with an ominous shake of the
                  head, an unfavorable comparison of the scapegrace with his honored sire, Old
                  Master, and a prophecy that if he do n't reform, he'll come to want, and them
                  overseers will be masters at the hall. Does the crushed malefactor urge in gentle
                  tones that he was merely entertaining his friends, and playing a hand at<pb
                     n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6146-00000042"/> cards, for amusement only? the countess
                  is unconvinced, and requests, with dignity, that she may not be told any thing of
                  that sort; she never thought that any son of Mistress would turn out a sorrow to
                  her; and with renewed ominous shakings of the head, she sends away the penitent
                  criminal, overwhelmed with remorse, and making good resolutions. Beautiful and
                  touching is the love of these old women for the children they have nursed; and
                  they cherish and love, and scold and forgive them, with the earnestness of real
                  maternity.</p>
               <p>Mammy Liza is an old woman with her head enveloped in a white handkerchief, and
                  she spins at the door of her comfortable cabin, from the summit of whose stone
                  chimney built up outside, a wreath of smoke rises, and glows like a stream of gold
                  in the sunrise.</p>
               <p>St. John hastens on, smiling, and his shadow falling before her, makes Mammy Liza
                  lift her old face. She utters an exclamation of great joy, and in a moment they
                  are sitting side by side on the old bench, talking of a thousand things—this talk
                  being chiefly on the part of the old woman, who, with the garrulity of age,
                  embraces the past, the present, and the future, in her monologue.</p>
               <p>For half an hour they thus sit side by side, and then Mr. St. John rises with the
                  bright smile which makes his countenance at times singularly attractive. He has
                  renewed with the old woman all those recollections of his youth and childhood,
                  rapidly disappearing amid the dust of the arena, and the kind old voice has
                  sounded to him like the softest music, the very echo of happiness.</p>
               <p>As he looks forth thus into the fields, he thinks he sees Bonnybel approaching,
                  and soon this is confirmed. He suddenly passes behind the door, and cautioning the
                  old woman, waits to give the young lady a surprise.</p>
               <p>She comes on with an active and springy step, clad in a brown gown, thick,
                  serviceable shoes, and a broad-rimmed chip hat; presenting thus a strong contrast
                  to the Miss Bonnybel of the minuet. But her cheeks are even more rosy, her eyes
                  brighter, her laughing lips resemble real carnations. She is followed by a small
                  negro maiden, carrying a basket and pitcher—the duty of this maiden at Vanely
                  being to watch Miss Bonnybel's countenance, and run at her nod.</p>
               <p>Bonnybel's voice salutes Mammy Liza, and asks how she is, to which the old woman
                  returns the reply that she is "poorly, thank God; how is Miss Bel?"</p>
               <p>"I 'm as gay as a lark," returns the young lady, summoning her body-guard, "and I
                  've been to see Aunt Jane and all the sick. Aunt Seraphina tried to take it away
                  from me, but I fought her and made her give up," added Miss Bonnybel, with great
                  cheerfulness.</p>
               <p>St. John, behind the door, laughs silently. The young lady continues, running on
                  carelessly:</p>
               <p>"Here 's some breakfast, Mammy. I suppose you know the news. Your great General
                  Harry 's come back! and now I suppose you think I 'm going to praise him! but you
                  're mistaken! He is terribly ugly! and the most disagreeable person I ever knew!
                  Lazy, too! just think of his lying in bed, with poor little me out here! It was
                  chilly enough when I got out of my warm bed. But I am going to get up every
                  morning, just to shame those lazy boys. Ha! ha! now you are getting angry, Mammy!
                  You want me to praise that stiff, awkward, lazy, odious, good-for-nothing Harry of
                  yours, but I won't! Do you believe that he had the audacity to kiss me! Humph! he
                  thinks I 'm a child still, does he? I'll make him know that I 'm a young lady! I
                  'm seventeen! and I intend to make every one of the boys run when I tell them!
                  some of 'em are glad enough to!"</p>
               <p>The young lady paused to catch her breath; but seeing what she considered an
                  expression of pain upon Mammy Liza's face, immediately recommenced:</p>
               <p>"Have I hurt your feelings, Mammy, with my talk about your boy? O! I was only
                  jesting! and I'll say any thing you wish! To think me in earnest! He 's the
                  dearest, sweetest, handsomest fellow in the world! I would n't have had him to
                  miss kissing me for any thing! He 's so<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6146-00000043"/>
                  erect, and proud, and noble! and has such an excellent heart! and dances so well!
                  and rides so well! and—"</p>
               <p>"Fishes young ladies from the water so well!" says St. John, coming from his
                  hiding place, with a laugh.</p>
               <p>Bonnybel retreats a step, almost screaming. She reconsiders this, however, and
                  bursts out laughing.</p>
               <p>"Ain't you ashamed, sir?" she then says, passing quickly to a pout, "to lie in
                  wait, and listen to me so! But there 's one comfort, you heard my abuse of you;
                  listeners never hear any good of themselves."</p>
               <p>"I did," said St. John.</p>
               <p>"You heard some bad too, then!"</p>
               <p>"Well, I'll mix the good and bad together, and perhaps I shall arrive at your real
                  opinion of your poor cousin."</p>
               <p>"Now you are commencing your mock humility. I detest you!"</p>
               <p>And Bonnybel draws away abruptly the small soft hand which, by some accident, has
                  remained in that of her companion since he took possession of it. There is,
                  however, very little detestation in the tone of the words, or the glance which
                  accompanies them.</p>
               <p>When they take leave of Mammy Liza, and return toward the mansion over the
                  beautiful dewy lawn, beneath the great oaks, bathed in the red sunlight, an
                  excellent understanding seems to have been arrived at, and Bonnybel is plying the
                  dangerous artillery of her eyes with fatal effect upon her companion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harry St. John is falling in love as rapidly as it is possible to go through
                  that ceremony.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
               <head type="sub">BONNYBEL LOOKS IN A MIRROR AND LAUGHS.</head>
               <p>THE ladies were assembled in the cheerful breakfast room, and half a dozen
                  servants were placing on the broad table a profusion of smoking edibles,
                  contributing to the perfection of that most perfect of inventions, a Virginia
                  breakfast.</p>
               <p>St. John mixed a julep with the skill and rapidity of an old practitioner, and the
                  ladies, having each taken a sip, the parties were soon seated around the board,
                  Miss Bonnybel behind the urn.</p>
               <p>"Did Mr. Alston commence his toilet when you did?" asked the young lady,
                  innocently, of St. John, glancing, as she spoke, demurely at the stately Helen;
                  "he takes as long to dress as a girl, and Bel Tracy said, the other day, that he
                  was no better than one, with his curls and perfumes!"</p>
               <p>Helen, with a dignified toss of the head, intimates her opinion of this attack
                  upon her admirer, but says nothing.</p>
               <p>"Just think of Mr. Alston on horseback!" continues Bonnybel, pouring out, "with
                  musquetoon, and saber, heavy boots, and pistols, going to the wars! Now you all
                  frown at me, as if it was treason to doubt that the elegant Mr. Alston would leap
                  out of his bed, and be ready at sunrise, if the trumpet called to horse!"</p>
               <p>"I doubt that myself, my dear Miss Bonnybel," said the subject of the
                  conversation, behind the young lady; "'t is only the breakfast bell that rouses
                  me."</p>
               <p>And Mr. Alston, in snowy ruffles, and serene smiles, saunters in and distributes a
                  comprehensive salute.</p>
               <p>"Was I the subject of discussion?" he says, amiably. "Chocolate, if you please,
                  Miss Bonnybel."</p>
               <p>"'T was Miss Tracy's epigram about you that was repeated," says St. John.</p>
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6146-00000044"/>
               <p>"Ah, Miss Tracy?" replies his friend. "A fine girl, Miss Tracy—told me she wished
                  she was a man, the other day."</p>
               <p>"Well, Tom, she said she regarded you no more than a girl. 'T is only reasonable
                  to suppose that she wishes to change her condition with her sex and marry you. Mr.
                  Bel Tracy, on the 10th, to Miss Thomas Alston, daughter of, and so forth, in the
                  'Gazette!'"</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston replies, serenely,</p>
               <p>"Delighted to marry Miss Bell Tracy, but not to change my sex."</p>
               <p>"I would," says Bonnybel.</p>
               <p>"You!" says St. John; "pray why?"</p>
               <p>"Oh we 'd have such glorious fox-hunts—I and the other boys!" cries Bonnybel, "and
                  such a jolly frolic afterwards!"</p>
               <p>The air of the young lady, while she utters these words, is so excellent a farce
                  that even Aunt Mabel laughs.</p>
               <p>"But, you will permit me," says Mr. Alston; "what would be the state of mind of
                  your adorers, Miss Bonnybel, for doubtless you wish to marry a young
                  gentleman."</p>
               <p>"No, sir! Pray whom?"</p>
               <p>"Why, let us say, Will Roan—why not espouse that gentleman?"</p>
               <p>"For a very good reason—he 's not asked me!" laughs the young lady; "besides, I
                  would n't if he did. I 've no desire to go halves in his affections with the
                  thorough-bred he 's had the goodness, I am told, to call 'Bonnybel,' after me,
                  forsooth!"</p>
               <p>"Well, Roan <emph>is</emph> fond of horses. But there 's Buck Ranton. He 's a fine
                  fellow; though I heard an aristocratic little lady in town, the other day, declare
                  that Mr. Ranton's family were scarcely 'good enough for <emph>her</emph>—he was
                  n't an F. F. V.'"</p>
               <p>"An F. F. V.? I hate that new-fangled phrase!" cries Bonnybel, "and I think the
                  young lady was a goose! I say Mr. Ranton 's every inch a gentleman, and I do n't
                  care a fig about his family!"</p>
               <p>"Why not have him then, my dear Madam?" urges Mr. Alston, gently.</p>
               <p>Bonnybel is silent—Mr. Ranton's misadventure being very recent.</p>
               <p>"Or Charley Fox," continues the gentleman, smiling, and sipping his chocolate; "he
                  at least does not fill his mind with horses like Mr. Roan."</p>
               <p>"But he does with his namesakes, the foxes!" says Bonnybel. "'T is even more
                  humiliating to divide with foxhounds than horses. Mr. Fox's wife is sure to be the
                  keeper of the kennels!"</p>
               <p>"Say Mr. Lindon, then."</p>
               <p>The girl's face clouds, and she says, coldly,</p>
               <p>"I do not like Mr. Lindon."</p>
               <p>"Well, well," says Mr. Alston, "then I will not further annoy you, unless you will
                  permit me to suggest the names of your friends, Mr. Randolph, Mr. Page, Mr.
                  Pendleton, or Mr. Braxton; I believe they all come occasionally to see you, do
                  they not?"</p>
               <p>A smile runs around the table, and for a moment there is silence. Mr. Alston has
                  given an accurate catalogue of the slain and wounded, for whose condition Miss
                  Bonnybel is responsible—for all these gentlemen have met with bad fortune at
                  Vanely.</p>
               <p>Bonnybel, however, is a true woman—that is to say, she finds no difficulty in
                  commanding her countenance.</p>
               <p>"Did you ask if these gentlemen were my friends?" she says, with the most
                  dove-like innocence, "and if they ever came to see me? Yes, they do, sometimes,
                  sir."</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston gently inclines his head, sipping his chocolate.</p>
               <p>"I thought I had seen them here once or twice," he replies, "though not very
                  frequently of late. However, I suppose they have one and all been detained by some
                  little accident."</p>
               <p>"Do you think so?" says Miss Bonnybel, with innocent curiosity; "but while I think
                  of it, pray how do you gentlemen propose to spend the morning?"</p>
               <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6146-00000045"/>
               <p>Mr. Alston acquiesces in the change of topic, and says with graceful ease,</p>
               <p>"I think I shall bestow my poor society on Miss Helen, if she is not afraid of
                  being thrown into a fit of yawning."</p>
               <p>"And I will ride out with you if you wish," says St. John to Bonnybel.</p>
               <p>This arrangement is acquiesced in, and the breakfast ends. Aunt Mabel retires to
                  her chamber to supervise the "cutting out," Miss Seraphina to peruse the last
                  romance brought from London, and the young men to smoke pipes and look at the
                  horses. The Vanely stables boast many thorough-breds, and more than one racer in
                  full training.</p>
               <p>St. John had that passion for fine horses characteristic of the soil, and with a
                  corn-cob pipe between his lips, in the midst of a crowd of stable-boys, who
                  respectfully greeted him as an old friend and favorite, discoursed at great length
                  to Tom Alston on the points of the animals, as they were led out, and stepped
                  proudly onward, in the sunshine.</p>
               <p>The last was a bay filly of elegant proportions, and this he ordered to be saddled
                  for Bonnybel, whose property it was.</p>
               <p>Soon afterwards—Tom Alston having sauntered back to the drawing-room—the young
                  man, mounted on his fine "Tallyho," was flying along a winding road of the Vanely
                  woods by the side of his cousin.</p>
               <p>It is said that ball-rooms, parlors, and social haunts in general, are
                  unpropitious for certain emotions. Either something distracts the attention or the
                  atmosphere is unfavorable to romance. It is added that it is extremely dangerous,
                  however, to a young man to ride alone, with a lovely cousin in a beautiful
                  forest.</p>
               <p>In the case of Harry St. John this proved true. After that ride, he felt with a
                  sort of fearful happiness, a rueful delight, that his fate was sealed. As they
                  galloped on, his eyes were unconsciously riveted on the mischievous little beauty,
                  who, with rosy cheeks and rippling curls, and slender figure, undulating in the
                  close-fitting riding-habit, resembled rather a wild nymph of the woods than a
                  mortal maiden. Every word she uttered was a jest or an exclamation; she performed
                  a thousand antics on her steed; the very spirit of the laughing audacious spring
                  seemed to flush her blood. The perfume of a thousand flowers crammed the balmy air
                  with fragrance; the birds sang joyfully from the oakes and pines; the leaves
                  whispered in the river breeze, and cast a fitful shadow on them as they moved.</p>
               <p>Our chronicle would grow to ponderous length, if we paused to record the witty
                  nothings uttered by Miss Bonnybel; her careless and sparkling jests, pointed with
                  laughter, and bright glances of coquettish eyes. We must leave the conversation
                  unrecorded. All lived, however, in the young man's recollection, and this ride
                  became one of the most delightful treasures of his memory.</p>
               <p>Three hours were spent thus; then the heads of the horses were turned toward home.
                  At the great gate they encountered the chariot, and were gaily greeted by the
                  jovial old colonel, who had been detained over night at the house of one of his
                  neighbors.</p>
               <p>They stopped but a moment; leaving the ponderous chariot to follow at its leisure,
                  they sped up the hill, and the foaming horses were checked before the great
                  portico.</p>
               <p>In helping the young lady to the ground, St. John did even more than his duty. He
                  quietly took her in his arms and lifted her from the saddle, receiving a box on
                  the cheek for his pains, given and received with laughter.</p>
               <p>Bonnybel then gathered her long skirt in her hand, and ran up stairs to her
                  chamber. It might have been supposed that her object was to lay aside her habit,
                  but her first proceeding was singular. She went to the large mirror, turned
                  herself from side to side before it, surveying, from every point of view, her
                  graceful face, her curls, her cheeks, her very dimples; then, with a proud and
                  triumphant toss of her little head, and a confidential nod, the maiden threw aside
                  her chip hat, and letting fall her beautiful brown hair, uttered a low laugh.</p>
               <p>Can any of our fair readers tell us what she meant?</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE NEWS FROM BOSTON.</head>
               <p>THE profuse dinner is nearly over, and nothing remains upon the wide table but the
                  nuts and wine.</p>
               <p>Leaning one arm upon the board, and pushing about the port and Canary, Colonel
                  Vane, with features which gradually flush with anger, addresses the two young
                  men:</p>
               <p>"Yes, gentlemen, you have a right to be astonished!" he says, "and I share your
                  astonishment."</p>
               <p>"But 't is not in the last 'Gazette,'" says Mr. St. John. "How could the
                  intelligence have arrived?"</p>
               <p>"Well, it arrived through a private channel, but a reliable one. An emissary, who
                  never deceives, announced it yesterday at the court house, and there is no longer
                  any doubt of it. Yes, things at last approach an issue. Government enacts that,
                  after the first day of June, the harbor of Boston shall be closed by armed troops,
                  her shipping shall rot in the bay, her streets be thronged with red coats, and
                  martial law prevail! What think you, gentlemen of the colony of Virginia, of this
                  blow at our beloved sister province of Massachusetts Bay?"</p>
               <p>"I think 't is a despotic and base exercise of power" says St. John, "and I 'd
                  resist at all hazards."</p>
               <p>"And I agree with you, Harry," says Mr. Alston, "to the letter."</p>
               <p>"You are right, gentlemen," said the old planter; "and no North American can see
                  Massachusetts holding out her hand without aiding her. Whatever touches her,
                  touches Virginia, nay, touches all the colonies, for this tyrannical edict is but
                  the entering wedge! If it does not arm the colonies, then they will lie down in
                  chains for ever! Miserable and woful times! tyrants and knaves banded against
                  honest men!" cries the old gentleman, dashing down his glass, wrathfully. "I'll
                  buckle on my sword and fight for the cause in the ranks, as a common soldier,
                  before I'll forget that I 'm a Virginia gentleman, and grovel in the dust, and
                  lick the boots of North and his yelping beagles. And not even tyrannical edicts
                  will answer! We are to be whipped into submission by this General Gage, commander
                  of his Majesty's forces in the provinces! He is to cut and hack us to pieces if we
                  dare to murmur! By Heaven! we are slaves indeed! We, the descendants of
                  Englishmen, with the strong arms of our forefathers, and their liberty as British
                  subjects! We who fought for the king on a hundred battle fields, and poured out
                  our best blood like water for our sovereigns; sovereigns that never gave us any
                  thing to bind our wounds, although we served them generation after generation, as
                  kings were never served! We Englishmen are to be trodden down and trampled on like
                  a pack of curs, and whipped back to our places by this body of time servers, who
                  are rolling yonder in their wealth, and making laws to bind the chains upon our
                  limbs, as though we were their serfs! Damn my blood!" cries the colonel, striking
                  the table with his fist, "I'll give half my estate to arm a company, and I'll
                  march myself at the head of it, if Cato has to hold me on my crutches."</p>
               <p>During the course of this explosive address, which was terminated by a sudden
                  attack upon the colonel's foot by his old enemy, Mr. St. John leaned back in his
                  seat, and, with folded arms, revolved, in the depth of his mind, the significance
                  of this new blow at the colonies.</p>
               <p>Was it not foreseen or even reported by its movers, by secret dispatches to Lord
                  Dunmore, and had not this fact something to do with the existence of his
                  Excellency's "guards" at the palace gate—soldiers who recognized no other
                  allegiance than that due to their master, and who, if need be, would be employed
                  to awe the inhabitants of Williamsburg and the House of Burgesses?</p>
               <p>And he was the commander of this body! He who swore by the code which the old
                  gentleman had just proclaimed, who rated his dignity of honest gentleman as<pb
                     n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6146-00000047"/> high as that of a peer of the realm, who
                  was ready to pour out his blood for the preservation of his most trivial right—he,
                  Henry St. John, was in the pay of his Excellency!</p>
               <p>The young man's brow clouded and his eyes flashed.</p>
               <p>"You are right, uncle," he said, "'t is a bitter draught they hold to our lips and
                  expect us to drink. I predict that this act will open the eyes of the inhabitants
                  of this colony, and that there will soon be a struggle for supremacy with Lord
                  Dunmore. In that cause, I, for one, know which side I'll be ranged on. I've long
                  felt that my position yonder was slavery, and nothing but disinclination to
                  retreat from my post in the service of the government, threatened with Indian
                  troubles, has kept me from resigning what has come to be a menial's miserable
                  routine! Lord Dunmore has deceived me, sir, in a manner wholly unworthy of a
                  gentleman, and I'll tell him so, if need be. Yes, sir! if the struggle 's here in
                  Virginia, I'll myself cheerfully brace on my sword, and strike as hard blows as I
                  'm able in the contest against this detestable tyranny! I am more than of your way
                  of thinking, sir. For this body of men across the water to be forcing down our
                  throats every nauseous dose they choose! binding us hand and foot with chains, no
                  doubt to lash us the better, and so force us along the king's highway, dragging at
                  our heels the lumbering parliament coach, with my Lord North and his family
                  inside! I'll no more wear their harness than I'll longer don the livery of his
                  Excellency, which I 'm fixed to discard and throw from me, as a plague garment!
                  I'll be no nobleman's dog, to hunt his prey and do his dirty work; I'll not be
                  this man's lackey—a vulgar fellow, in my humble opinion, neither more nor less,
                  and I'll say it to his face, if I 'm provoked to it!"</p>
               <p>St. John stopped, red, angry and disdainful, thinking of the scene at the
                  palace.</p>
               <p>"Well, well," said the colonel, relieved by his explosion, "let us not speak evil
                  of dignitaries, Harry. I confess I do not like Lord Dunmore, but he is
                  Governor."</p>
               <p>St. John made a motion of his head, indicating his willingness to dismiss so
                  distasteful a subject.</p>
               <p>"All I have to say, sir," he added, "is that things in Virginia seem to be
                  progressing, and we'll probably have an act of Parliament for our own special
                  behoof ere long."</p>
               <p>"Well, well," said the old gentleman, who seemed to regret his momentary outburst,
                  "we shall see."</p>
               <p>"If I am not much mistaken, sir, his Excellency will endeavor to make us shut our
                  eyes as long as possible, and use his skill to make us believe black 's white.
                  Yes, sir, we shall see, and perhaps we shall do more—we shall fight!"</p>
               <p>There was silence after these words, and the colonel filled his glass and pushed
                  the wine.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps we will not find in his lordship a tool of the ministry, Harry," he said,
                  "and my old blood flushes up too hotly. I should set you youngsters a better
                  example than rashness. You are already too full of fight. I remember Lord
                  Botetourt said to me one day that he 'd throw his appointment into the Atlantic
                  rather than aid in enforcing upon Virginia a tyrannical regulation of Parliament;
                  and who knows but the like public spirit may exist in the bosom of Lord Dunmore;
                  at least 't is time lost to speculate at present. Let us hold in, and watch the
                  action of the House of Burgesses. If they proceed to the resolves which become
                  them, they will come to a point, and his Excellency will have to show his
                  hand."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said St. John, "and I predict that you'll see a card up his
                  sleeve."</p>
               <p>The old gentleman smiled.</p>
               <p>"Well, well, Harry," he said, "we won't charge him with cheating till we see it;
                  and then it will be time enough to outlaw him. Thank Heaven, we have noble players
                  in the game! There's Bland, and Pendleton, and Harrison, and Henry, a host in
                  themselves, especially this last, who 's an absolute thunderbolt. There 's Lee,
                  and Randolph, and Nicholas, and Cary, all gentlemen of conspicuous talents. Mr.
                  Jefferson from the mountains, too, goes, I 'm told, all<pb n="94-95"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000048"/> lengths, and is of extraordinary political genius.
                  We must not forget Colonel Washington, whose fine house at Mount Vernon is so
                  delightfully situated on the Potomac. You know how heroically he fought in the
                  expedition against Fort Duquesne, in which I am told he gave General Braddock
                  advice which it had been well for that ill-fated gentleman to 've taken. Certainly
                  Colonel Washington is of admirable presence, and there is I know not what of
                  majesty in his deportment, and grandeur in the carriage of his head. I think we
                  have a worthy body of gentlemen engaged at present in our public affairs, and
                  history may yet dwell on our period and its characters, and future generations may
                  erect statues to these patriotic leaders of opinion. Certainly they do seem to
                  possess remarkable unanimity in distrusting his lordship. But let us wait, Harry,
                  and not try his Excellency before he is caught with the bloody hand—an unfortunate
                  illustration I have fallen on, but—"</p>
               <p>"It's apt, sir."</p>
               <p>The colonel shook his head in a good-humored way and smiled.</p>
               <p>"No, no, Harry," he said, "let us be just to all men; let us not forget that
                  moderation is the most fatal enemy of despotism, until it throws off its disguise.
                  Then there 's time enough to gird on the sword. My preaching and practicing are, I
                  confess, somewhat different on the present occasion, and I've set you a bad
                  example. But the old hound growls the loudest, you know, because he's got no
                  teeth, and thinks every shadow reason for alarm. There, there, Harry, let us leave
                  all this to the future, and to that Almighty Power in whose hand are the balances
                  of fate—the issue of peace and war!"</p>
               <p>St. John bowed his head, and was silent.</p>
               <p>"I 'll go take my nap now, boys," added the old gentleman, smiling pleasantly;
                  "that road to the river 's all fixed, and I shall sleep with a good conscience,
                  and have pleasant dreams, I trust."</p>
               <p>Having delivered himself of this good-humored speech, the old gentleman emptied
                  the remainder of his glass of Canary, and, assisted by Bonnybel, who ran to give
                  him her shoulder, limped from the room into the library upon the opposite side of
                  the hall.</p>
               <p>Here, composing himself comfortably in his customary arm-chair, with the gouty
                  foot across another, the worthy colonel covered his face with a copy of the
                  "Virginia Gazette," and very soon was slumbering like an infant.</p>

               <p>When the family descended on the next morning, they saw ranged in a long row upon

               <p>This ceremony had been performed by Miss Bonnybel, under the colonel's
                  supervision, and from that time forth, until the end of the revolutionary
                  troubles, no tea was drunk at Vanely, as happened at a thousand other places all
                  over the colony.</p>
               <p>After breakfast, Mr. St. John and the colonel went to witness some operations upon
                  the lands, and Mr. Alston, as usual, betook himself to the sitting-room.</p>
               <p>We have busied ourselves so exclusively with the sayings and doings of two

                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000049"/> Mr. Alston has been far from idle, and has
                  vigorously applied himself to the prosecution of an undertaking which we have
                  scarcely hinted.</p>
               <p>Let us still forbear to intrude upon this gentleman's private interviews with his
                  friend; let us respectfully retreat when he closes, on this eventful morning, the
                  sitting-room door upon himself and that friend; let us go and return with Mr. St.
                  John and Colonel Vane, who get back in their light carriage after an hour or
                  two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston's sulky stands at the door—his horse's head held respectfully by a
                  groom.</p>
               <p>To the colonel's question, whether Mr. Alston intends to depart, his friend, Mr.
                  St. John, replies that he has not been advised of such intention; and learning
                  soon that his friend has gone up stairs, he follows him, and finds him there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston is seated in an easy-chair, with one foot upon the window sill, the
                  other being elegantly thrown over his knee.</p>
               <p>He is gazing philosophically out upon the landscape, and nods with tranquil
                  greeting to his friend.</p>
               <p>"What, Tom!" St. John says, "surely you 're not going away: seeing your
                  sulky—"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I think I 'll go, Harry, my boy," says Mr. Alston, leaning back easily.</p>
               <p>"Why, pray?"</p>
               <p>"For two reasons."</p>
               <p>"Name them, in order that I may instantly refute them."</p>
               <p>A serene smile wanders over Mr. Tom Alston's countenance, and he regards his
                  friend with quiet superiority, as of one impregnable.</p>
               <p>"Do you think you'll be able, Harry, my boy?" he asks.</p>
               <p>"I am confident of it."</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston smiles and shakes his head.</p>
               <p>"Come, speak!" says St. John.</p>
               <p>"You want my reasons?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, both at once, if you choose."</p>
               <p>"I prefer mentioning them in succession, Harry," says Mr. Alston, "if it 's all
                  the same."</p>
               <p>"Entirely: well the first?"</p>
               <p>"My first reason for departing from this elegant abode of the muses and the
                  graces," says Mr. Alston, eloquently, "is the absolute necessity I 'm under of
                  procuring a clean——frill, let us say. Can you answer that?"</p>
               <p>"Easily—you know my whole wardrobe's at your service."</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston shakes his head in the old way.</p>
               <p>"Unfortunately your garments do not fit me, Harry," he replies, "and nothing but
                  regard for your feelings has prevented me from revealing the misery I've
                  experienced from the frill I borrowed of you yesterday."</p>
               <p>"Why, there 's none better in London!"</p>
               <p>"You 're deceiving yourself, my dear friend—you do indeed!" says Mr. Alston,
                  almost earnestly; "indeed you are mistaken! Were it not from regard for your
                  friendship I should feel compelled to say that your linen 's absolutely
                  terrible!"</p>
               <p>St. John laughs.</p>
               <p>"Well," he says, "there's no appealing from a matter of taste. <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">Mutato nomine de te,</foreign> you know, and I'll wager that the
                  weaknesses in my own wardrobe are shared by your own. But there remains the reason
                  in reply, that you may easily have clothes brought to you from Moorefield."</p>
               <p>"I fear not."</p>
               <p>"Why?"</p>
               <p>"They would necessarily be rumpled, and to wear a rumpled frill plunges me into
                  untold agony."</p>
               <p>"Hang it, Tom," says St. John, laughing, "you 're really the most perfect
                  maccaroni I have ever seen. There 's no arguing with such a fop—dyed in the
                  grain!"</p>
               <p>"My dear friend, you pain me," says Mr. Alston, mildly; "pray, do n't pursue this
                  mode of talking."</p>
               <p>"Well, that is as you choose. Come, what 's your second famous reason for
                  departing? I predict I'll easily refute this one at least."</p>
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6146-00000050"/>
               <p>Mr. Alston smiles.</p>
               <p>"Do you think so?" he says.</p>
               <p>"I am confident of it."</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston nods serenely, and is silent.</p>
               <p>"Come speak, thou unconscionable Sphynx! Thou enigma of mystery, unfold thy
                  logic."</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston smiles again.</p>
               <p>"I will ask you a question first, my dear Harry," he says. "If you had laid siege
                  to a fortress for many months—had plied the enemy with your heaviest chain shot,
                  and red-hot cannon balls—if you had sounded the trumpet at last, and so advanced
                  bravely to the assault with your colors flying, and your charger neighing—and in
                  this, the final and conclusive onset, been ignominiously beaten back—do you
                  understand?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, so far."</p>
               <p>"I ask, under such a state of things, would you be likely to remain in presence of
                  the victorious enemy; be cut, and hacked, and wounded; worse still, be cut to
                  pieces and disposed of in a bloody trench, as some one of my friends, the poets,
                  says? Answer me, or rather do n't, for I see, from your dumb-foundered look, that
                  my reasoning has been conclusive."</p>
               <p>And Mr. Alston smooths his peruke gently, smiling.</p>
               <p>"You do n't mean to say—" cries St. John, with an outburst.</p>
               <p>"I do indeed, my friend. I have the honor of observing that this morning my
                  addresses were respectfully declined by Mistress Helen, and you behold, really,
                  the most unfortunate of men!"</p>
               <p>St. John stands, for a moment, looking at his friend in silence; his friend
                  returns the look with pleasing smiles.</p>
               <p>"Well, Tom," says St. John, "I <emph>will</emph> say that you are the most
                  philosophical discarded lover I have ever seen."</p>
               <p>"Philosophical?"</p>
               <p>"Intensely."</p>
               <p>"Why, Harry, my boy, you do n't think that propriety requires me to strew ashes on
                  my head, do you? If you think so, there 's the fire-place, and, doubtless,
                  sackcloth is convenient."</p>
               <p>"What a philosopher!" cries his friend in admiration.</p>
               <p>"Well, well, I arrogate no praise. Why should I? Why should I pull a long face and
                  groan? My friend, 't is the fortune of war, and I add, in the unsuspecting and
                  confiding simplicity of my nature, that this event has happened to me with the
                  same young lady twice before. This should, doubtless, be estimated in the matter,
                  for, you see, I am used to it."</p>
               <p>St. John received this declaration with a burst of laughter.</p>
               <p>"And you are not desperate?" he says.</p>
               <p>"Not at all. After that decent interval which propriety requires, I shall again
                  request Miss Helen's acceptance of my hand, and if she refuses, I shall probably
                  ask her again. Who knows? Some day I am likely to win her, and she 's worth the
                  trouble. She 's no soft peach, my boy, ready to fall into your mouth. The happy
                  fellow who gets her will be obliged to shake hard, and, you see, I've been
                  shaking. Perhaps the fruit 's looser, and will some day fall—patience, and shuffle
                  the cards!"</p>
               <p>Having delivered himself of these remarks, Mr. Alston rises and adds,</p>
               <p>"I waited to see you, Harry, before going, and I hope you'll come to Moorefield
                  soon. If you 're here a week I'll probably see you again, as I 've promised Miss
                  Helen to repeat my visit. There, my dear boy, do n't stare and laugh so. One would
                  think you were surprised at such a thing as a young fellow's making the attack and
                  being beaten. I confess I was somewhat precipitate. I thought I saw a defect in
                  the wall of the fortress—in fact Miss Seraphina told me that Miss Helen admired my
                  peruke, and thought I 'd make a very amiable husband. I should not have been so
                  much deceived—but nothing's lost. I'll soon be back."</p>
               <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6146-00000051"/>
               <p>And after the young men had exchanged some more conversation—serene on Mr.
                  Alston's part, and full of pent-up laughter on St. John's—they descended to the
                  hall.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston went round, in the Virginia fashion, and took separate leave of
                  everybody, with a friendly and smiling remark for each.</p>
               <p>He trusted that the colonel's gout would soon leave him, and that the road to the
                  river would be all he expected.</p>
               <p>He hoped Aunt Mabel would not have a return of her cough—these colds must be very
                  painful.</p>
               <p>He thought Miss Seraphina's coiffure was the handsomest he 'd ever seen.</p>
               <p>He begged Miss Bonnybel to give him the rose in her hair or one of the two in her
                  cheeks.</p>
               <p>And he expressed to the blushing and quiet Helen the most graceful thanks for the
                  thousand kind things she had done for him during his most delightful visit—a visit
                  which he should ever continue to remember, and would certainly repeat before many
                  days had passed.</p>
               <p>Having gone through these various friendly and complimentary speeches, Mr. Alston
                  pressed his cocked hat on his heart, and smiling with the utmost courtesy, bowed
                  low, and issued forth.</p>
               <p>In ten minutes his light sulky, with its rapid trotter, had disappeared in the
                  forest, was seen to glitter with revolving flashes on the road, and then finally
                  it disappeared, carrying away the discarded model of a lover, or the model of a
                  discarded lover, whichever our fair friends please.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">HOW MR. LINDON CAME TO AND WENT AWAY FROM VANELY.</head>
               <p>SEVERAL days have passed. It is a beautiful May morning. Bonnybel and St. John are
                  talking together in the sitting-room—a habit into which they have of late quietly
                  and tacitly fallen.</p>
               <p>Bonnybel sits in the most coquetish attitude upon one of the old carved-backed
                  sofas, her slender figure supported by the round, bolster-like pillow. She wears a
                  light blue silk, and around her bare arms falls a quantity of lace. From the skirt
                  of her azure silk peep forth in the most accidental way two delicate little feet,
                  cased in white silk stockings, and red morocco slippers, with high heels and rich
                  rosettes. The slender ankles are gracefully crossed—the beautiful feet seem
                  wrapped around each other, so to speak—an ill-natured critic might say that Miss
                  Bonnybel had fixed them thus for her companion's inspection and admiration.</p>
               <p>He sits at her side, and is showing her a book of engravings. One of these is a
                  woman weeping upon the breast of a steel-clad cavalier—the illustration of some
                  border ballad.</p>
               <p>He reads to her, and—for the moment, thoughtful—Bonnybel's eyes are weighed down
                  with an impulsive pity. It is a tale of love, devotion and death; and as he reads,
                  she turns upon him a pair of violet eyes swimming in tears.</p>
               <p>No word is uttered—the volume lies on her lap—St. John holds her unconscious hand,
                  and the beautiful face, with its large eyes full of tender pity, droops slowly and
                  unconsciously as it were, toward the picture of the woman weeping in her husband's
                  arms.</p>
               <p>This is the pretty little tableau, when, with a shock which skakes both windows,
                  the door is thrown open, and a tall,<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6146-00000052"/>
                  richly-clad gentleman, the arrival of whose splendid equipage they had not been
                  aware of, is ushered into the apartment. Bonnybel rises calmly to her feet—closing
                  the volume which she holds in her hand—and returns the low salute of the visitor
                  with a cold and ceremonious inclination. Mr. Lindon will pray be seated, and if he
                  will excuse her a moment, she will retire to arrange her somewhat informal
                  toilette. Mr. Lindon, she believes, is acquainted with her cousin, Mr. St.
                  John.</p>
               <p>With these formal sentences, Miss Bonnybel moves from the apartment and goes up
                  stairs with the air of a duchess subjected to an intrusion.</p>
               <p>The two men greeted each other with ceremonious coldness; on the part of Mr.
                  Lindon there seemed even an exhibition of suppressed and somber rage at the
                  changed demeanor of the young lady.</p>
               <p>He was a tall, powerful man, verging, apparently, on forty, and his bearing
                  indicated a supercilious and yet uneasy pride.</p>
               <p>In a few moments Colonel Vane entered, and soon afterwards the ladies appeared.
                  Mr. Lindon did not seem a great favorite with these, and when he announced his
                  intention of spending the day and night, as his estates lay at some distance, the
                  intimation did not appear to cause any one unusual pleasure. All were scrupulously
                  courteous and polite, but nothing more.</p>
               <p>In Virginia, where cordiality and warmth, in the reception of visitors, are a
                  standing rule, a greeting of this species always indicates dislike.</p>
               <p>We have heard Miss Bonnybel, under Mr. Alston's teasing, speak coldly of the
                  visitor; let us endeavor briefly to exhibit the cause of this coldness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lindon was the only son of an English Catholic of ancient family, who had
                  purchased lands on the South Side. These purchases had become a principality, in
                  extent and value, at the time of his death, and his son found himself the
                  possessor of a princely estate. Lindon the elder had been a bigoted Catholic and
                  aristocrat in the worst sense of the term, and his son inherited the same
                  opinions. He honestly regarded his family as the best in the colony, and regarded
                  rebellion against England as a crime of the deepest die.</p>
               <p>Early enabled to command large resources, Mr. Lindon had plunged at once into
                  every species of vice and dissipation. He had lost immense sums at the card table,
                  and even had been charged with cheating. More than one humble family had been
                  brought to misery and ruin by his vices—and he was liable, at times, to horrible
                  excesses in wine, which had already greatly impaired his vigorous constitution.
                  His character was a strange mixture of boldness and cunning, of reckless courage
                  and hidden treachery, and the influence of his religious training, in the worst
                  tenets of the Jesuits, was very discernible. Under an affectation of chivalric
                  honor, he concealed a powerful tendency toward secret scheming, and this
                  unfavorable characteristic already began to be suspected by the gentlemen with
                  whom his position enabled him to associate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lindon had made the acquaintance of Bonnybel some months before, and she
                  became the passion of his life. He paid his addresses to her with a conquering
                  air, however, and, to his profound surprise, found himself at once discarded.</p>
               <p>He had scarcely been able to restrain an explosion of rage and astonishment; that
                  a man of his family and wealth should be refused, was wholly incredible to him,
                  and after a month's reflection, he came to the conclusion that there was some
                  misunderstanding in the matter.</p>
               <p>Let us pass over the events of the morning, and the ceremonious dinner, so unlike
                  the habitual family reunion, full of talk and laughter, and come to the afternoon.
                  Perhaps we shall find if there was such misunderstanding.</p>
               <p>The meal had been over for an hour, and as they dined early in those days, Mr.
                  Lindon solicited the company of Miss Bonnybel for a walk. The young lady pouted,
                  but finding it would be discourteous to refuse, consented, hoping<pb n="104-105"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000053"/> ing to induce Mr. St. John and Helen to accompany
                  them. Helen was unwell, however, and so, in no favorable humor toward her
                  cavalier, Bonnybel was soon walking with Mr. Lindon on the lawn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lindon's cheeks were somewhat flushed with the wine he had been drinking; but
                  the Canary of the colonel seemed only to have added to his habitual ceremony—his
                  uneasy air of haughty defiance.</p>
               <p>"We have a fine evening, Miss Vane," he said, settling his chin in his voluminous
                  white cravat, "and this scene reminds me of that at my estate of 'Agincourt.'"</p>
               <p>"Does it, sir?" she said, coldly.</p>
               <p>"Yes; it was so called by my father, the name of the family hall, in England,
                  being similar."</p>
               <p>Mr. Lindon settled his chin deeper in his white cravat, and added:</p>
               <p>"It originated after the great battle of that name. Sir Howard Lindon, my
                  ancestor, won his spurs there, though our race came in with William the
                  Conqueror."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"The king, in recognition of Sir Howard's services, created him a Knight of the
                  Bath, which, however, he did not long enjoy, having fallen on the field some years
                  after."</p>
               <p>"You do not retain the title, I believe, sir," Bonnybel said, coldly, forcing
                  herself to say something.</p>
               <p>"I do not, having no right, I fear, madam. It is hard to be thus deprived of what
                  's honestly my due."</p>
               <p>Bonnybel inclined.</p>
               <p>"Like many other noble families," said Mr. Lindon, raising his head proudly, "we
                  have suffered misfortune, and of all our princely possessions, in the mother
                  country, nothing remains. It is true that my place of 'Agincourt' is not wholly
                  contemptible, consisting as it does of ten or twelve thousand acres, with three
                  dwellings, besides the manor house."</p>
               <p>And Mr. Lindon settled his chin again.</p>
               <p>"That is a very fine estate, I should think, sir," said Bonnybel, coldly.</p>
               <p>"Yes, tolerably fine, but my negroes, a thousand in number, if I do not mistake,
                  are badly managed. Still I can not complain. My annual income, from numerous
                  sources, is some fifteen or twenty thousand pounds sterling, and I find that
                  adequate to my wants."</p>
               <p>"It is a very handsome income, I should suppose, sir."</p>
               <p>"Vanely is not quite so large as Agincourt, I believe, madam?"</p>
               <p>"I am sure 't is not, sir," said Bonnybel, quite calmly; "though I do not know the
                  extent of papa's grounds."</p>
               <p>"Vanely is very richly cultivated."</p>
               <p>"Is it, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Very—but you will pardon me for saying that I did not come hither, upon this
                  occasion, to compare plantation views with Colonel Vane, madam."</p>
               <p>"You did not, sir?"</p>
               <p>"No, Miss Vane, and I think you do not misunderstand me."</p>
               <p>Mr. Lindon's stately ceremony did not melt at all as he thus spoke. Bonnybel made
                  no reply.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lindon was silent for some moments too, then he said,</p>
               <p>"I observed that this scene of hill and meadow, oak forest and pine, reminded me
                  of 'Agincourt,' and I often sit upon my portico and think of Vanely."</p>
               <p>"Do you, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, madam, and I will add, of yourself."</p>
               <p>Bonnybel inclined her head silently, and prepared for the rest.</p>
               <p>"Since I had the misfortune to be deprived for a time of your society"—this was
                  Mr. Lindon's graceful paraphrase of his discardal—"I have not been able to banish
                  your image from my mind, Miss Vane."</p>
               <p>Bonnybel was still silent and cold.</p>
               <p>"I have found no one to supply your place," continued<pb n="106-107"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000054"/> Mr. Lindon, with a look of increasing
                  condescension, "and you will thus scarcely be surprised to find that I have
                  returned to ask if you have not seen reason to change your determination. Do not
                  speak yet, Miss Vane—you seem about to—I desire you to ponder before replying. It
                  is proper that I should repeat that I am the possessor of a great estate, and this
                  fact can not be destitute of weight with a young lady of your excellent sense. Of
                  my family, I think, I need not speak," he said loftily, "but I should of more
                  material things. As my wife, you will have, at your command, every luxury which
                  wealth can purchase, chariots, plate, fine horses, and assemblies as often as the
                  mistress of 'Agincourt' pleases. I am quite willing, if you desire it, to settle
                  upon you an annual amount to the extent of one third of my entire income; one
                  entire third, I say, madam, and this you may expend in such manner as may seem
                  suitable to yourself. It is proper to say that I shall require my sons to embrace
                  the faith of the Catholic Church, unjustly excluded by the bigots of this colony,
                  but I am willing, if it is desired, to permit my daughters to become Protestants,
                  either of the established Church or the new sect of Baptists, it being quite
                  indifferent to me whether they are of one or the other persuasion, if they are not
                  of the true church. With these conditions, I desire to leave my wife wholly to her
                  own views in every matter, and I will compel all who are around her to yield to
                  her wishes. If Miss Vane has any desire to change her former decision, she has now
                  an opportunity, and I need scarcely add that her affirmative decision will be a
                  source of much satisfaction to myself."</p>
               <p>Having finished his speech, Mr. Lindon again buried his chin, in a stately way, in
                  his neckcloth, and was silent.</p>
               <p>Bonnybel did not speak for some moments, and then she merely said, struggling
                  successfully against her anger and indignant scorn,</p>
               <p>"I am surprised, sir, that you should have again renewed this proposition,
                  and—"</p>
               <p>He interrupted her more grandly and ceremoniously than ever, and said, with a
                  motion of his hand,</p>
               <p>"Your surprise is quite natural, Miss Vane. I can understand that you naturally
                  feared that I would not return, having treated me, upon our last interview, with a
                  coldness which I am sure you have regretted. You are right, madam. Men of my stamp
                  seldom renew a proposition of this description, and there is room for some
                  astonishment in the present instance. But I have set my mind upon seeing you
                  preside at my house of 'Agincourt,' and your rebuff has not repelled me. You, no
                  doubt, regretted it, and I desire to afford you an opportunity of reconsidering
                  your determination."</p>
               <p>His tone was so insulting with its stately condescension now, that Bonnybel
                  blushed with speechless indignation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lindon misunderstood the origin of this emotion, and said, in the same
                  patronizing way,</p>
               <p>"Do not permit your agitation to carry you away, Miss Vane. I can understand that
                  you did not expect this, and am not desirous of compelling you to declare your
                  regret at our misunderstanding in any formal manner. We are nearly at the portico
                  now, and I beg that you will compose yourself. A simple line, as I depart in the
                  morning, will be sufficient, and if I may suggest, you might fix as early a day as
                  is consistent with social propriety. I shall be very happy to have your cousin,
                  Mr. St. John, as my first groomsman, though he does not seem well affected toward
                  the government, and may cause me some trouble with his Excellency. I beg to assure
                  you that in any such contingency I shall be most happy to use my influence. We
                  have arrived, madam, and I regret to see you so much overcome with the natural and
                  engaging modesty of your sex. But I beg you will not be flurried. I shall expect
                  your reply when I depart in the morning, and, meanwhile, shall spare your maiden
                  blushes, and not renew the subject."</p>
               <p>They had reached the portico as Mr. Lindon concluded this oration, and were now
                  joined by Helen and Aunt Mabel.</p>
               <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6146-00000055"/>
               <p>Bonnnybel left her stately admirer, and hastened up stairs, whether to hide her
                  maiden blushes, or burst into tears of scorn, and anger, and indignation, we leave
                  the reader to determine. She did not reappear during the whole evening, and only
                  came down stairs on the next morning when Mr. Lindon's fine equipage stood at the
                  door. Her cheeks burnt with indignant fire, and her little foot almost ground
                  itself into the carpet with anger as she murmured, "He shall not think I 'm afraid
                  to meet him!"</p>
               <p>She restrained her scorn by a violent effort, however, and when Mr. Lindon invited
                  her into the library, coldly declined. Her hand held a note tightly, however, and
                  this note Mr. Lindon took with an expression of condescending satisfaction.</p>
               <p>He bowed ceremoniously, and with his head raised in a conquering attitude, entered
                  his chariot and drove away, holding the reins himself.</p>
               <p>Bonnybel watched him with the same look of scornful pride, but suddenly this
                  expression gave way to one almost of pleasure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lindon turned in his seat almost foaming with rage, and tore a piece of paper
                  which he held in his hand; after which he shook his clenched fist at the hall, and
                  lashing his wild horses, disappeared like lightning.</p>
               <p>The torn paper was Bonnybel's note, and this note contained simply—</p>
               <p>"Miss Vane declines, now and for ever, the insulting addresses of Mr. Lindon. If
                  they are renewed, she will regard it as an out age unworthy of a gentleman. She
                  prays that all personal acquaintance, even, may henceforth cease between
                  them."</p>
               <p>That was all. And if any reader thinks our little heroine too fiery, it is because
                  we have not drawn the portrait of her admirer with sufficient force.</p>
               <p>When Helen took leave of Mr. Alston, a kind look of regret gret was in her eyes;
                  when Mr. Lindon departed, Bonnybel's eyes flashed dangerously.</p>
               <p>The reason was that Mr. Alston was a gentleman—Mr. Lindon was not. But the fact
                  made him all the more dangerous, as this history will in due time show.</p>

               <p>I desire to be informed why you have not written to me, madam? Has that odious
                  domestic tyrant, Mr. Willie, forbidden you to correspond with your friends? You
                  may inform him, with my compliments, that I regard him in the light of a
                     <emph>monster,</emph> an <emph>ogre,</emph> an eastern <emph>despot,</emph>
                  else he would not keep the <emph>dearest girl in the world</emph> down at that
                  horrid old house in Glo'ster—if it is so fine—when her friends are dying to see
                  her.</p>
               <p>I hear that he runs at your call, and obeys your <emph>orders,</emph> and passes
                  all his leisure moments in composing sonnets to your eyebrows; but I do n't
                  believe it, that is, I would not if it was not <emph>you,</emph> dear. He
                     <emph>was</emph> very humble once when he was on <emph>probation,</emph> and
                  I'll never forget his lordship's look of agony and despair when you gave the
                  jessamine bud to Tom Alston that day at the ball; but heigho! (that 's the way the
                  romance writers spell a <emph>sigh,</emph> is n't it?) I do n't believe any thing
                  of that sort survives the <emph>honeymoon</emph>—does it? Before we're
                     married—<emph>we're</emph> married!—the beaus are all maccaronies in their
                  dress and manners; and they rhyme <emph>love</emph> and <emph>dove, sighs</emph>
                  and <emph>eyes, kiss</emph> and <emph>bliss,</emph> 'till one's really wearied
                  with them. Then when the odious hypocrites have worked upon our

               <p>"What a flood of nonsense I've written! but I 'm in excellent spirits this
                  morning, and I never feel ill at my ease with you, my own precious, darling Kate.
                  It is very good in you to let a mere child like me take so many liberties with
                  you. But you know you 've <emph>raised me;</emph> always at Effingham Hall you
                  made me your companion, young as I was; and, if I had my arms around your
                  companion, young as I was; and, if I had my arms around your neck now, I 'd
                  squeeze you to death! <emph>I would! Please</emph> write soon. I long to hear from
                  you, for I love you <emph>dearly—dearly!</emph> and if you do n't write, I'll come

               <p>"There 's little or no news in Prince George; we have been plagued, as usual, by a
                  crowd of stupid boys, tho' some nice gentlemen came too. I have had another visit
                  from my bugbear, that Mr. Lindon, but I <emph>do n't think he'll call again in a
                     hurry.</emph> He made me the most insulting <emph>speech</emph> you can think;
                  but I returned it with interest. You would have thought he was bidding for a
                  slave-girl. I gave him my answer in writing, and he tore it up, and went off in a
                  rage. He may rage as he pleases.</p>
               <p>"Dearest papa has the gout again, but it did not prevent his going to court the
                  other day, and coming back in high indignation about the new Act of Parliament—the
                  attack on our liberties. They think they'll make us slaves, but they are very much
                  mistaken. I've sealed up all <emph>the tea</emph>—and I 'd die before I 'd drink a
                  drop!</p>
               <p>"We all rode to <emph>Mr. Bland's</emph> the other day, and found the dear old
                  gentleman home from the Burgesses. His sight is failing, and he wears a green
                  blind, but there's no finer gentleman in the world. He made me a beautiful bow and
                  kissed my cheek. There are very few of the rising generation like papa, or Squire
                  Effingham, or Mr. Bland.<ref rend="super" target="#note_008" xml:id="return_008"

                  I 'll never grow tired looking on the meeting of the two rivers, the white ships
                  and dipping boughs. Frances Randolph is there from <emph>Matoax,</emph> with the
                  baby, who is almost walking. She is as dark and lovely as ever, and little
                     <emph>Johnny</emph> is a wonder of beauty. He 's a darling love of a baby, and
                  has a complexion like a lily-with the morning sun on it! There, madam! what would
                  Mr. Cowley say of that? I think they ought to have called him Bland, too, or

                              ride out with me. On our return from one of these rides, he had the
                              audacity to take me in his arms! Just to think of his impudence! but I
                              boxed him soundly! Of course, 't was in lifting me from the saddle. I
                              fell into the water, coming back from the "Charming Sally," and the
                              lieutenant had the goodness, in putting on my slipper, which I 'd
                              dropped, to squeeze my foot into a jelly! Just reflect! <emph>to

               <head type="sub">HOW MISS BONNYBEL FAINTED IN THE ARMS OF HER COUSIN.</head>
               <p>ALTHOUGH Miss Bonnybel carefully forgot to state the fact, St. John had
                  accompanied them on the visit to Jordan's and Cawson's, riding by the old chariot
                  on his fine "Tally-ho," and adding very much to the zest of the journey by his wit
                  and humor.</p>
               <p>The young man was now quietly domiciled at Vanely; the fact that he was lieutenant
                  of the Governor's guards appearing never to cross his mind. He had left his
                  subordinate in command, and did not trouble himself further. His whole thoughts
                  were absorbed in the pursuit of the now "cherished object."</p>
               <p>Day by day, thus lingering at Vanely, he became more dangerously enthralled. He
                  constantly found, or thought that he found, in the little maiden, some new and
                  more exquisite attraction.</p>
               <p>Nor was this wholly the result of fancy. Since his last visit, Bonnybel had
                  greatly changed, and was changing still. To every maiden comes a time when,
                  opening from bud to blossom, into the perfect flower of womanhood, she stands upon
                  the banks of the fast-flowing stream, and sees, in dreams as it were—dreams full
                  of mysterious loveliness—an unknown face: and with sighs and smiles, feels in her
                  pulses a new life before undreamed of. Thus was it with the careless little witch
                  of Vanely. St. John, when he came again to the familiar old mansion, saw, in place
                  of a romping child, a beautiful young lady.</p>
               <p>He had left Bonnybel a girl, and found her, all at once, a woman. The change in
                  her person was even more remarkable than in her character. Before, her figure was
                  ungracefully angular, and many of her movements abrupt and awkward. Now all this
                  had disappeared. Still slender, her person was yet full and exquisitely rounded;
                  every motion was gliding and full of grace; the cheek, once too pale, was now
                  round and blooming like a rose; the large eyes were brilliant, melting, and full
                  of what the poets have described as "liquid light." In a word, that marvelous
                  change which is so peculiar to the girl just budding into the woman, had come over
                  the young lady, and with every passing hour the influence deepened, the rosy
                  cheeks grew rosier, the pouting lips bloomed with a richer carnation, the
                  dangerous eyes increased their fatal brilliancy.</p>
               <p>Bonnybel possessed that rare and indefinable attraction, which, in all ages, has
                  brought men to the feet of the women endowed with it. With far less beauty of
                  feature, her influence would probably have been nearly as great. Her mobile and
                  ever changing countenance reflected, as from a mirror, the ceaseless play of her
                  thoughts and feelings. She was, by no means, at all times, the wild and coquetish
                     girl,<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6146-00000058"/> full of mirth and laughter; at
                  certain moments, every trace of gaiety disappeared, and the bright eyes swam in
                  tears, or were fixed upon vacancy with a sad intentness.</p>
               <p>She sang delightfully. And here again she was finely endowed. She not only
                  caroled, with the most contagious mirth and wild abandon, the "comic" ditties of
                  the period—"Within a Furlong of Edinborough Town," "Pretty Betty Martin, tip-toe
                  fine," and others; she sang, with a sadness and pathos equally contagious, the
                  songs of sentiment then popular—"Flowers of the Forest," "Grammachree," "Farewell
                  to Lochaber," and that beautiful ditty which sounds like the sigh of the autumn
                  wind through the broom straw, the inexpressibly pathetic "Katherine Ogie."</p>
               <p>Of these songs, sung by Bonnybel, our worthy author says—They are the sweetest, I
                  think, of all the Scottish minstrelsy. But all are sweet, far more so than the
                  ditties of to-day. They sound for us now with a dim memorial music, those
                  madrigals which were caroled by our grandmothers to the murmur of old ghostly
                  harpsichords, while, standing by the little beauties, our respected grandfathers
                  were captivated, and for ever after dreamed of those old tunes, and loved them as
                  the echoes of past happiness and youthful joys, and all that carnival which
                  glitters and darts onward in the rosy dawn of youth. I knew an old gentleman who
                  would often take his book of ancient Scottish songs, and murmur them to himself
                  for hours; and I've frequently seen my dear and honored father sit, with wistful
                  smiles, and pensive eyes, recalling, as he listened to his favorite "Flowers of
                  the Forest," youthful hours, and the little maiden who sang for him, the same
                  song, in the days of silk stockings and hair powder, early in the century.
                  Kind-hearted and true Virginia gentleman, whose hand has so often rested on my
                  head in childhood, may you sleep in peace! O noble father, gone from us to heaven!
                  thinking of you now, here in the sunshine, and of what was a rarer, purer
                  sunshine—your sweet smile—the idle words I write swim as I gaze on them. I lay
                  down my pen and muse, and am thankful for the blood that flows in my veins, for
                  the noble sire bestowed upon me by a gracious and kind Heaven!</p>
               <p>But let us not listen further to the worthy old gentleman. The personages of our
                  history demand attention—the scenes which attended Mr. Harry St. John's visit to
                  Vanely. Let us return thither for a brief space, before following the current of
                  the chronicle which glides away to mix itself with the roar of history. Let us
                  linger in the old domain, and watch the ripple of that stream of colonial life
                  which has flown from us, and seems now to murmur from remote and misty shores. Let
                  us gaze upon the snowy clouds, serenely floating over emerald fields to the far,
                  mysterious horizon; hear the whisper of the ocean breeze in the Vanely oaks, and
                  follow our hero, Mr. Henry St. John, in his gradual approaches toward the woman
                  whom he loved.</p>
               <p>That he had reached this point, his own heart no longer left him in the least
                  doubt. A new influence seemed to have descended upon his life; every thing became,
                  as it were, transfigured. A purer orange shone in the sunset and the dawn, the
                  waves upon the shore were perfect music, the songs of birds came to him like a
                  divine harmony of joy and love. The future, which before he had scarce given a
                  thought to, opened now a grand, illimitable landscape, bathed, as it were, in rosy
                  and enchanting sunlight. The poor, cold, trifling past had disappeared like a
                  dream of the hours of darkness, and in the marvelous radiance of the new dawn, the
                  heart of the young man throbbed, his cheeks glowed like a boy's; the world seemed
                  to him one great field of flowers, over which wandered slowly, like some fairy
                  queen of a sinless realm, the figure of the woman whom he loved. Strange power of
                  ardent and true love! which in our cold, prosaic age is so often strangled by the
                  dust of the conflict, or in the inexorable grasp of mammon; which the dilettanti
                  and the "men of the world" sneer at; which for that reason, if no other, may
                  demand respect and honor!</p>
               <p>Of the endless walks, and talks, and rides, and excursions,<pb n="116-117"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000059"/> we have no room to speak. Perhaps we are fortunate
                  in this, since our friends, the sneering philosophers of the new school, might
                  call the history "love-sick," and visit us with their displeasure.</p>
               <p>Still, let us go with the young man and his companion on one of these excursions.
                  Perhaps the ocean breeze may blow on the page, and that is better than the dust of
                  streets.</p>
               <p>It is a balmy morning, and unloosing a sail-boat from the Vanely wharf, St. John
                  assists the girl to her seat, and spreads the white sail, which the wind fills
                  immediately.</p>
               <p>Directed by the skillful paddle, the sail-boat plunges its cutwater into the
                  waves, and, like a waterfowl with outstretched wings, flies down the broad
                  river.</p>
               <p>Little is said by either the young man or his companion as they float on. The
                  beautiful landscape, the fleecy clouds serenely drifting across the blue sky, the
                  soft and balmy air, these seem to discourage idle conversation; an indefinable
                  feeling steals over Bonnybel, and she is silent and pensive. Half reclining on the
                  gunwale of the boat, she listens to the murmur of the waves, surrendering herself
                  wholly to the influence of the time and scene.</p>
               <p>St. John thinks that he never saw her look more lovely, and, in truth, the picture
                  is attractive. The wide straw hat, with its fluttering ribbons, has fallen back
                  upon the graceful neck, and the young lady's profuse brown hair, parted in the
                  middle of her forehead, lies in a mass of curls upon her shoulders. The head
                  droops forward in a pensive attitude, and as the boat runs before the breeze, the
                  fingers of the wind caress and bring a blush, as it were, to the damsel's cheeks,
                  blowing her hair in ripples from the white forehead, and fluttering gayly the gay
                  ribbon knots which decorate her bodice. The odors of the foliage and flowers along
                  the banks combine to fill the atmosphere with breaths of fragrant perfume, and the
                  brilliant sunlight falls in a silver flood upon the wide expanse, glittering in
                  the ripples, and rejoicing, so to speak, in its tranquil splendor.</p>
               <p>Bonnybel leans lower over the boat's side, and plays with her fingers in the
                  water, and, with a smile, flirts some drops toward St. John. Then raising her
                  head, she follows the flight of a hawk or an eagle, disappearing in the clouds, or
                  her glance rests upon some white-sailed ship winging its way like a sea-bird to
                  the ocean; or with half-closed eyes, in a dreamy reverie, she listens to the song
                  of birds, heard faintly from the forest, whose rich leaves dance and twinkle in
                  the sunshine, moved by the balmy wind for ever blowing.</p>
               <p>Such idle words as were uttered, the gay breeze bore far away; those winds of
                  other years still hold the secret.</p>
               <p>They came at last opposite the old island of Jamestown, and in obedience to the
                  young lady's wish, St. John ran the boat ashore, and they landed.</p>
               <p>The old church and a few ruins only remained, with one or two fishermen's huts
                  near at hand, and lingering among the ruins, the young man and his companion
                  talked of old times.</p>
               <p>Few spots on earth possess the interest of Jamestown island. It was here that the
                  New World was born and cradled, in storm and blood. Here lived and thought, and
                  fought, and suffered, and triumphed, one of the noblest and truest gentlemen that
                  ever walked the world—Captain John Smith. Here Pocahontas was received into the
                  church and married; the child who had held a hero's head upon her bosom, to defend
                  it from the savage war-club; who lives yet in ten thousand hearts, as the
                  impersonation of the highest, truest womanhood, of love, pity, a devotion which
                  counted life as nothing if she might save from death a poor, unknown, disarmed
                  captive! The monumental pride of kings in hard marble or the stubborn bronze will
                  go to decay, lapse back to earth, and they and their actions be forgotten. But the
                  story of Pocahontas shall be known and remembered by a mighty host of unborn
                  millions, who will love and honor her.</p>
               <p>They spoke of the Indian princess, lingering in the old ruins, and on the spot
                  where she had so often stood, and<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6146-00000060"/>
                  Bonnybel's pensive eyes seemed to wander to the past, as her companion went
                  on.</p>
               <p>"We lead but poor cold lives compared with her," she said at last, with a deep
                  sigh; "we are nothing but butterflies!"</p>
               <p>And plucking a flower from the ruins, she added,</p>
               <p>"As this bud to the artificial flower of the dressmaker, so does Pocahontas
                  compare with us. There, it is not worth while to deny it; it is true, and 'pity
                  'tis, 'tis true.' You are descended from Pocahontas—there, I present you with the
                  flower. It is time to go home."</p>
               <p>The tide was favorable, as it was coming in, and taking in the sail, St. John
                  plied his paddle, and slowly returned to the Vanely wharf. They had then the new
                  recreation of a walk through the fields, and, as though for their especial
                  benefit, the day became even more delightful. The affluent glory of the morning
                  deepened, a languid pleasure seemed to brood over the landscape; as St. John
                  walked by Bonnybel's side, he felt as if he were making a journey through fairy
                  land.</p>
               <p>They were not to reach home without incident, however—an incident of a nature
                  sufficiently startling.</p>
               <p>Their path wound through the meadow, crossed a brook, skirted with deep grass and
                  flowers, and then ascended the hill. They paused by the brook side, and Bonnybel
                  requested her companion to go and get her a bunch of wild honeysuckle flowers,
                  which was visible fifty yards off, in a clump of bushes.</p>
               <p>St. John left her side, and the young lady was strolling along the little stream,
                  when her attention was attracted by a singularly brilliant object, apparently
                  lying in the grass. It looked like a jewel, and was buried, so to speak, in a
                  bunch of thick herbage.</p>
               <p>Suddenly the bright object moved. Turning deadly pale, the girl started back, and
                  a stifled cry escaped from her colorless lips.</p>
               <p>It was a rattlesnake of the largest size; and as the girl gazed toward the
                  horrible object with panting bosom and charmed eyes, the reptile unrolled his
                  great bulk, and raised high up above the bunch of grass, his loathsome, but
                  beautiful crest.</p>
               <p>In an instant this crest seemed to swell and expand—it assumed a hue like
                  topaz—and the small, piercing eyes burned and glittered with a light which seemed
                  to deprive the girl of her will.</p>
               <p>She stretched out her arms and tried to cry aloud, but her voice expired in a
                  moan.</p>
               <p>The reptile's wide mouth was all at once expanded, and his sharp teeth, bending
                  backward, glittered in a deadly row. The forked tongue shook with an angry
                  vibration; the tail began to move and curl to and fro.</p>
               <p>The girl was spell-bound by those glittering and satanic eyes, which charmed and
                  dazzled her, while they chilled her heart's blood. She had never for a moment
                  given credit to the stories of this influence; but she now found a horrible
                     <emph>attraction</emph> in those eyes. She felt a mingled desire to fly and to
                  advance—the eyes of the snake terrified her to death, yet drew her toward him.</p>
               <p>But suddenly this expression of the eye changed. The rattlesnake seemed to abandon
                  the idea of charming, and to be mastered by anger. The piercing eyes darted flames
                  of fire, the crest burned and blazed with a thousand colors, the forked tongue
                  darted to and fro like lightning, and the huge folds of the reptile rapidly
                  undulated, writhed about, and changed into all the colors of the rainbow. At the
                  same moment the tail was raised and shaken with the rapidity of a humming bird's
                  wings; the huge mouth opened, and the deadly rattle rang out in the silence.</p>
               <p>The girl knew that this was the signal of the serpent's spring, and she no longer
                  struggled against her fate. Her knees bent beneath her, a cold perspiration
                  streamed from her brow, and with laboring bosom, and head thrown back like a
                  wounded bird, she closed her eyes and lost consciousness.</p>
               <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6146-00000061"/>
               <p>She was aroused by the contact of cold water on her brow and hands, and opening
                  her eyes, found herself lying in the arms of Mr. St. John.</p>
               <p>At two paces from her the rattlesnake lay dead—completely severed in the middle.
                  St. John had seen her attitude of horror, had heard the deadly rattle, and arrived
                  just in time to strike the snake with a pliant stick, and prevent the girl from
                  falling. She now lay on his bosom, panting and trembling, and hiding her face. She
                  attempted to draw back, and half rose to her feet, but her eyes falling on the
                  reptile, her strength was again paralyzed, and the second time she fainted in Mr.
                  St. John's arms.</p>
               <p>The young man saw that it was absolutely necessary to remove her from the
                  repulsive object, and doubtless was not displeased with his duty. He hastily took
                  Bonnybel in his arms, as if she was a child, and bore her to some distance.
                  Placing her pale and inanimate form on a bank, he quickly brought some water in
                  his hat and threw it in her face.</p>
               <p>The color came back to her cheeks, she uttered a deep sigh, and opened her eyes.
                  It was some time before he could reassure her, and make her understand that there
                  was no longer any danger. He succeeded at last, however, and leaning on her
                  cousin's arm, Bonnybel slowly returned home. We forbear from relating the scene
                  which ensued. Mr. St. John was the hero of the hour for performing his duty.</p>
               <p>Bonnybel did not recover from her horror for a week, but at the end of that time
                  her gaiety returned, and as she was going to retire one night, she told St. John,
                  with an audacious look, that if he had asked her on the day of the accident, she
                  would certainly have kissed him.</p>
               <p>"It was of no importance," returned the young man, laughing. "I had you in my arms
                  and carried you fifty yards; your cheek lay on my shoulder; it is the softest I
                  ever felt."</p>
               <p>"Humph!" cried Miss Bonnybel, with a decided pout; "highly improper in you to take
                  a young lady in your arms! and I 'd like to know what <emph>you</emph> know about
                  girls' cheeks! Well, I won't quarrel with my brave defender! I 'm very glad I 'm
                  alive; I 'm sure 't is infinitely better than being dead. Good night, my
                  lord!"</p>
               <p>And the little witch slams the door, and runs to her chamber singing. St. John
                  follows her example and dreams of her.</p>

                  <p>"I thought I should have died of laughing, Kate! He drove up to the door in his
                     little sulky, with the pretty bay trotter, and got out with as easy and
                     careless an air as if <emph>nothing at all had happened</emph> on his last
                     visit. I think he is the most delightfully cool personage I 've ever known, and
                     were I one of the medical profession, I should prescribe for the spleen or
                     melancholy, a single dose of Mr. Thomas Alston! His demeanor to sister Helen
                     all day was really enchanting. The most critical observer could not have
                     discerned a shade of embarrassment on his part. At first <emph>she</emph> was
                     very much put out, but I believe she ended by laughing—at least I saw her
                     smile. He inquired how Miss Helen had been since he had last the pleasure of
                     seeing her; he was happy to say that his own health and spirits had been
                     excellent!</p>
                  <p>"Did you ever hear of such a man? What a wretch! Just as much as to say, "If
                     you fancy I 'm in the dumps because you discarded me, you 're very much
                     mistaken!" And now mark my prediction, Kate—sister Helen will end by marrying
                     him! just as sure as you 're alive. And I should n't<pb n="122-123"
                        xml:id="VAC6146-00000062"/> blame her. Do n't tell anybody what I am now
                     going to say—do n't even whisper it—but, hold your ear close!—<emph>we girls
                        like a gallant that won't take a repulse!</emph> Do n't we?</p>
                  <p>"There 's no news but Jenny's marriage. I 'm out of patience with the post for
                     not delivering my letter. I described every thing, and crossed every page. I
                     never saw <emph>Curle's</emph> so full of company or so noisy. Some of the
                     young men got terribly, or delightfully tipsy, for they were very amusing.
                     There was a bowl of apple toddy that would, sure, have floated a ship, and some
                     of the gentlemen visited it so often that they lost the use of their <emph>sea
                        legs.</emph> That jest is not my own—'t is second-hand.</p>
                  <p>"I stood, as I told you, with Barry Hunter, and he made himself very agreeable.
                     My dress was white brocade, with rosettes of satin ribbon. The head-dress was
                     of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">point de Venise,</foreign> my hair looped up with
                     the pearls mamma presented me at Christmas—the whole crowned with a wreath of
                     roses. I wore a pair of the stays I told you of, from Mr. Pate's, in town. They
                     fit admirably to the figure, and I bend with ease in them, which can't be said
                     of the new-fashioned ones I got from <emph>London.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>"I wish my letter telling you every thing had not been lost. There were a
                     number of your friends there—Mr. Cary, Mr. Pendleton, and that
                     remarkable-looking gentleman, Mr. Tazewell, of <emph>Kingsmill,</emph> with his
                     statue-like head and flowing hair, parted in the middle like a picture of
                        Titian.<ref rend="super" target="#note_010" xml:id="return_010">*</ref> Mr.
                     Pendleton danced a minuet with me, with admirable grace, but said with his
                     silvery voice and extraordinary sweet smile, that he was becoming an old
                     gentleman, and must make way for the youngsters. Mr. Jefferson from the
                     mountains, came up as he left me, and made himself very agreeable, laughing
                     with a pleasant wit at every thing. I do n't wonder in the least at Martha
                     Wayles marrying him, in spite of his wild pranks at college which they talk

                     happened to me, that is, the girls all thought it such, but I did n't care a
                     button. I was dancing with Barry Hunter, in the reel, when one of the young
                     heroes, who had <emph>lost his sea legs</emph> from too great devotion to the
                     inspiring punch-bowl, trod on my skirt and tore it <emph>dreadfully.</emph> I
                     stumbled besides, and made the bride a low bow, kneeling gracefully <emph>on
                        one knee!</emph> The gentlemen all ran to aid me, though I rose at once, and
                     they gave the unfortunate young gentleman, who 'd caused the accident, the
                     blackest possible looks. Barry Hunter would have followed, and called him to
                     account, had I not prevented it. The poor fellow, whose name I 'll suppress,
                     made me the humblest apology, for which I gave him my hand and a laugh; he 's
                     since presented me with a copy of verses, so exactly descriptive of myself that

                     really terrifying scene I had with a rattlesnake. His Excellency Lord Harry St.
                     John acted in the most heroic manner, and after killing the snake, had the
                     extreme goodness to take me in his arms, as I 'd fainted, and carry me some
                     distance. O! it was awful, Kate! I see the horrible eyes still, but I won't
                     think of it. 'T was in coming back from a sail on the river, and a visit to
                     Jamestown island. By the bye, I wonder if Pocahontas was <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">brunette;</foreign> I should suppose so, as his Excellency,
                     the Lieutenant, who 's descended from her, and admires her hugely, is dark. I
                     'm happy to say that <emph>I'm</emph> blonde—am I not? You did not tell me the
                     truth of the report that his lordship was courting down in Glo'ster. When I ask
                     him he laughs. Do you know, Kate, he 's sadly deteriorated; he 's really the
                     most odiously disagreeable person I know, and wearies me to death. I wish he 'd
                     go and marry his Glo'ster beauty, but I fear there 's no such good luck—is
                     there? Tell me in your next letter, if you think of it. I 'm dying to have some
                     one to tease him about when he returns from Richmond town, whither he 's going
                     in a day or two.</p>

               <head type="sub">AT THE "TRYSTING TREE."</head>
               <p>THE highest point in the Vanely "chase," studded all over with great trees, which
                  throw their twinkling shadows on the green sward, is crowned by a mighty oak, from
                  the foot of which a noble view may be obtained.</p>
               <p>Around the base of the tree is arranged a wicker seat, immemorially, if tradition
                  may be believed, the favorite resort of lovers. Indeed, the great oak, time out of
                  mind, has been known as the "Trysting Tree."</p>
               <p>It is a balmy evening, and the sun is about to set. A thousand birds carol in the
                  orange atmosphere, darting from tree to tree; the swallows circle on quick wings
                  around the stacks of chimneys, up above them, crimson now in the sunset. It is the
                  hour above all others favorable to lovers, and the two personages, whose fortunes
                  we relate, are sitting on the wicker seat of the trysting tree.</p>
               <p>The attitude of Bonnybel would make an excellent picture. It is such as we have
                  described, on the morning of<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6146-00000064"/> Mr.
                  Lindon's visit, when St. John and herself were reading from the book of
                  ballads.</p>
               <p>The coquettish maiden leans back upon the picturesque seat. She wears her pink
                  dress, ornamented with ribbon knots, and her bare white arms are encircled by the
                  red coral bracelets. A rebellious mass of curls has fallen, by the purest
                  accident, of course, upon her shoulders, and in the same accidental way, a pair of
                  exquisite feet appear from beneath the young lady's skirt. This accident
                  invariably happens to Miss Bonnybel in spite of her most anxious care. They are
                  remarkable feet; one of the "minute philosophers," gifted with a genius for poesy
                  and exclamation points, might write a chapter on their <emph>expression.</emph>
                  They are slender, with lofty insteps, and seem made to dance over flowers and
                  sunny sward, in the revels of May. Rich red rosettes burn on the insteps; the
                  slippers are of blue morocco with high heels, and pointed toes; they are secured
                  with ribbons crossed above the delicate ankles. They wrap themselves around each
                  other as before, and occasionally move about, in a way that would induce a carping
                  observer to declare that the little maiden was abundantly aware of their being
                  visible, and wanted her companion to admire their beauty.</p>
               <p>As she reclines thus in the rich light of the balmy evening, which pours a flood
                  of joyous splendor on her face, her hair, her dress, down to the rich rosettes, in
                  bold relief against the slender little feet, Miss Bonnybel presents a picture of
                  the most coquettish beauty; at least this is the opinion of her lover, Mr. Harry
                  St. John.</p>
               <p>He has been relating for her entertainment the legend of the trysting tree; how a
                  lovely little ancestress of the Vanely family met a youth here, who had lost his
                  heart with her; how the maiden played with him and amused herself, and gave him
                  her brightest and most encouraging smiles, and ended by haughtily discarding him
                  in the flattest and most <emph>surprised</emph> way, when he said how madly he
                  loved her. He had left her without a word, with only a profound, cold inclination
                  clination of his head, and for a time the little beauty had not been able to
                  realize the fact that his pride had been outraged. She expected him to return, but
                  he did not come. She met him at public places, and beamed on him with her most
                  coquettish sunshine; he bowed and passed her without speaking. She came to love
                  him with a love greater even than his own former sentiment for her; he did not
                  come. She wrote him a laughing, jesting note, inviting him to Vanely; he excused
                  himself. In a fit of rage and despair she married a wealthy planter, twice her
                  age, and on the night of her wedding, stole from the company, and was found, in a
                  fainting fit, on the wicker seat of the trysting tree.</p>
               <p>Ten years afterwards, her lover was slain in the great rebellion of 1676, and they
                  found, on his dead body, a letter in the handwriting of a woman, with the words,
                     "<emph>I loved you and am wretched, for I can never see you more.
                     Farewell.</emph>" The ball which tore through his heart had obliterated the
                  name signed to the epistle, and it was replaced upon the pale, cold bosom, and
                  buried with the body.</p>
               <p>This was the legend of the trysting tree, related by St. John for his companion's
                  amusement. Bonnybel listens silently, and at its termination says, with a heavy
                  sigh,</p>
               <p>"That 's just the way with men; they never love truly, but fly off, at a moment's
                  warning, for a glance or a word they dislike."</p>
               <p>"Do n't you think he was right?" said her companion.</p>
               <p>"Right! who could ever think so?"</p>
               <p>"I do."</p>
               <p>"Right to leave the girl he loved, because she did not yield to his suit at the
                  first word? Forsooth! you lords of creation are truly very reasonable."</p>
               <p>"I think he was right," said St. John, "because no man should suffer his self
                  respect to be invaded even by the woman he loves. If he do n't respect himself,
                  how can she? It was thus in the legend. The young gentleman loved the<pb
                     n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6146-00000065"/> young lady honestly and truly; she
                  beckoned to him with her eyes, and held out her hands to him, as 't were, to come
                  and receive them. Well, he obeys the enticing eyes, and smiles; he blushes, may
                  be, with the thought that he 's surely going to be happy; he is an honest
                  gentleman, he loves her; she says, plainly, 'I love you with my whole heart,'
                  though she does not speak, and on this hint he <emph>does</emph> speak. But,
                  instead of yielding, she looks indignant; she is <emph>surprised,</emph> bestows a
                  haughty look upon him, repulses him. Come now, my dear, could he still remain
                  beside her, much less love her?"</p>
               <p>"I'll thank you to keep your 'my dears' to yourself, sir!" says Miss Bonnybel,
                  with a look which says "you may call me so as much as you please." "I think the
                  hero of the legend acted as no true lover could. Humph! to leave her, and put on
                  his grand airs when she even condescended to smile, and hold out her hand, and
                  solicit him. I 'd have boxed his ears! No gentleman really in love could have
                  refused her hand."</p>
               <p>"I could have done it."</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! I know what you would have done; you would have taken it! Now, just fancy
                     <emph>me</emph> the young lady; I 'm only a poor little country maiden, but I
                  shall act her part."</p>
               <p>And with the most audacious and bewitching glance, crammed full of coquettish
                  attraction, and caressing blandishment, Bonnybel held out one of her small white
                  hands toward her companion.</p>
               <p>He put both of his own behind his back, with a laugh.</p>
               <p>Bonnybel, thrown suddenly off her guard by the action, colored to the roots of her
                  hair, and her pouting lips contracted with anger.</p>
               <p>"So your lordship is determined to act the part of the hero to the life, are you?"
                  she said, with flushed cheeks.</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>Bonnybel turned from him with a toss of the head, and pouting elaborately, played
                  in a fretful way with the tassels of her girdle.</p>
               <p>St. John quietly waited for her mood to change. He did not mistake in his
                  calculation. Bonnybel played petulantly for some moments longer with the tassels,
                  then stole a wary glance at her lover, writhed the small slippers around each
                  other, and finally meeting Mr. St. John's smiling eye, colored slightly, and burst
                  out laughing.</p>
               <p>"I suppose you would refuse my hand if I offered it in my own character, as simple
                  Bonnybel Vane," she said.</p>
               <p>And with a hesitating movement, she released the unfortunate tassels, and seemed
                  about to give the hand, but drew it back suddenly.</p>
               <p>It was too late.</p>
               <p>"Refuse <emph>your</emph> hand!" said St. John, bestowing upon the young lady a
                  look so tender that she turned crimson, "I should refuse it thus then!"</p>
               <p>And imprisoning not only one, but both of the soft hands in his own, the impulsive
                  lover drew Bonnybel toward him, and seemed about to press his lips to her own.</p>
               <p>The young lady uttered an exclamation, and with a slight struggle released
                  herself.</p>
               <p>"How dare you presume, sir," she cried, "to try to kiss me? You ought to be
                  ashamed of yourself."</p>
               <p>"Cousins, you know!" laughed the young man, "'t was only the cousin's privilege I
                  was about to take!"</p>
               <p>"A pretty excuse!" said the young lady, with a rosy blush, and pouting more than
                  ever, "and just look, sir! my hair 's all tumbled down by your rudeness."</p>
               <p>In truth the beautiful brown hair lay in a brilliant mass upon her shoulders, and
                  a stray curl wandered down and fell upon the young man's cheek, as he sat on the
                  projecting root beside her feet.</p>
               <p>"I can testify my contrition in one way only," he said, smiling, "but you will not
                  let me."</p>
               <p>"In what way, pray?" said Bonnybel, recovering her<pb n="130-131"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000066"/> daring self-possession, and bestowing upon him her
                  customary glance of provoking attraction.</p>
               <p>"I will act as your lady's maid," he said, "I have done so often, you know."</p>
               <p>And in spite of some slight resistance on the part of the girl, he gathered up the
                  beautiful locks and set about arranging them. We are bound to say that the
                  resistance offered by Miss Bonnybel was such as to make her smiling companion
                  think she was not really averse to his obliging proposal. Bonnybel had the most
                  beautiful hair, as soft and glossy as silk, and she was not unwilling to have it
                  admired. Then, after all, Mr. Harry St. John was her cousin and playmate, and in
                  Virginia, ceremony of every sort falls to the ground before the magical spell of
                  "cousin."</p>
               <p>So Mr. Harry St. John applied himself assiduously, but not rapidly, to his task.
                  Let not the cynical reader laugh when we relate that his pulse galloped fast as he
                  took in his hands the bright, perfumed curls, and touched the rosy cheek by purest
                  accident. When a young man is as much in love as was our hero—we would urge upon
                  the critics in his favor—the cheek will occasionally flush, the heart will beat—by
                  singular good fortune the hearts of the cynical philosophers are never known to
                  beat.</p>
               <p>"There, sir!" cried Bonnybel, suddenly, "you've had time enough!"</p>
               <p>"What beautiful hair you have!" he said, finishing his task, "and how I admire
                  it."</p>
               <p>"That 's all about me that you admire, then, I suppose."</p>
               <p>"No indeed; I admire every thing. But I need not assure you on this point. In
                  truth, Bonnybel," added the young man, taking his former seat upon the root at her
                  feet, "I do n't know how I shall get on, when I 'm away from you now."</p>
               <p>And there was so much seriousness in his tone, that the young lady, this time, did
                  not laugh.</p>
               <p>"You know I go to Richmond town to-morrow, and thence to Williamsburg. When I can
                  come again I do n't know. His Excellency is my master, you see, and I've already
                  taken an immensely long holiday. I certainly calculated on being arrested, or at
                  the very least, on a terrific explosion. But this is not interesting to you. I may
                  escape the storm of wrath and come back some day."</p>
               <p>"Not interesting to me?" said Bonnybel, passing, as she often did, from mirth and
                  jest to sadness, and looking at the young man as she spoke, with her large, sad,
                  serious eyes; "why do you say that what concerns you can not interest me?"</p>
               <p>St. John sighed.</p>
               <p>"I do n't mean, my dear—but you do not like me to call you, 'my dear'—"</p>
               <p>"It is nothing," she said, in a low voice.</p>
               <p>"Well, I do n't mean that you'll not take a certain interest in my life, dear, for
                  we are of one blood. But I find myself doubting the reality of any deep sympathy
                  in any one. You see, Bonnybel, I never knew my father or my mother, that is, they
                  are mere figures of my early childhood. It is true that uncle and aunt have been
                  as kind to me as kind can be, but I have always felt, as it were, alone in the
                  world."</p>
               <p>"That is not just; you know how much we—all—love you."</p>
               <p>"Then you will be glad to know that I am well and happy? You say 'we
                     <emph>all.</emph>' Does that mean that <emph>you</emph> care any thing for me?"
                  he whispered, taking her hand and gazing into her eyes, with a long, fixed
                  look.</p>
               <p>With the beautiful head sorrowfully drooping over the right shoulder, and her
                  large, sad eyes, fixed on his own, the young girl, not withdrawing her hand,
                  murmured in a low voice,</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>The sweetest hours of evening had descended on them, as they tarried beneath the
                  old trysting tree, and the orange west grew fainter as the great orb sank slowly
                  to its couch in the purple waves. The east began to twinkle with a<pb n="132-133"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000067"/> million stars, and the balmy breeze of the ocean
                  sighed through the great boughs above, and died away in a low murmur. The birds
                  had folded up their wings and gone to rest, the last lingering rays of sunset rose
                  like golden crowns from the lofty chimneys of the old hall. The whole landscape
                  sank, field after field, tint after tint, into warm and dreamy sleep.</p>
               <p>St. John held in his own the unresisting hand of the young lady, and those words
                  which determine often the fate of a whole life, were on his lips. As he gazed upon
                  the exquisite countenance; upon the large eyes swimming in pensive sadness; upon
                  the graceful head, with its clustering curls drooping toward the shoulder; upon
                  the pouting lips, half parted, as in some dreamy reverie, his glance grew more
                  fixed and tender, his cheek flushed impetuously, and he drew the hand he held
                  toward him.</p>
               <p>Poor St. John! Unfortunate lover! Suddenly a voice greets him—a voice from
                  behind—and Miss Seraphina, in capacious sunbonnet, and holding a bunch of May
                  flowers, is added to the party. She has been out walking, and on her return,
                  seeing the two young people at the trysting tree, has determined to bestow her
                  company upon them. Approaching from behind, she had remained unseen, until they
                  were in contact almost.</p>
               <p>Miss Seraphina does or does not suspect something; but at least she smiles, and
                  launches forth cheerfully on a variety of subjects. St. John utters an inaudible
                  sigh, and as Bonnybel says that it is time for her to go in, accompanies the
                  ladies to the house.</p>
               <p>The young man and Miss Bonnybel seemed both preoccupied throughout the early part
                  of the evening, but toward bed-time the young lady's gayety seemed to return, and
                  she bade farewell to Mr. St. John, who was going with the Vanely race-horses to
                  Richmond, at an ealy hour, with her former air of mischief and coquettish
                  satire.</p>
               <p>"I trust your lordship will very soon return," she said; "the next time, I promise
                  to be in the drawing-room with my hair elegantly dressed, and you'll kiss me at
                  your peril, sir! We'll surely meet at the assembly, but I count on having you come
                  back before that time. Pray do so, if you think the inducements here sufficient. A
                  pleasant journey!"</p>
               <p>And giving him her hand, with an audacious glance from her dangerous eyes, the
                  young lady dashed up the broad stair-case, candle in hand, and disappeared.</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John was "finished," but his smile seemed to indicate that he felt any
                  thing but pain.</p>

               <head type="sub">ST. JOHN MAKES HIS ENTRY INTO RICHMOND TOWN.</head>
               <p>ON the following morning, at early dawn, the young man was in the saddle, and
                  followed by the grooms, leading the race-horses, set out for Richmond town. He had
                  volunteered his services to see his uncle's horses safely conveyed and entered at
                  the races there<ref rend="super" target="#note_013" xml:id="return_013">*</ref>
                  —his intention being to proceed thence to Williamsburg.</p>

                  <p><ref target="#return_013">*</ref>Historical Illustrations, No. XIII.</p>
               </note>
               <p>The cavalcade traveled slowly in order that the horses might be in the best
                  possible condition, and as the races did not take place till the next day, St.
                  John stopped and spent the night at Cawson's, the residence of his friend, Colonel
                  Theodoric Bland. Little John Randolph and his mother were still there, and the
                  young man held in his arms the afterwards celebrated orator of Roanoke.</p>
               <p>On the next morning, early, with the exchange of many cordial good wishes, he set
                  out again on his journey, and crossing in the ferry-boat, entered Richmond town in
                  the midst of an enormous crowd, attracted by the double festival of the fair and
                  the races.</p>
               <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6146-00000068"/>
               <p>The town was scarcely more than a village straggling along a winding creek which
                  emptied its bright waters into the James, flowing in serene majesty from the foot
                  of the falls away into the immense forest.</p>
               <p>On a hill to the west, above the river, foaming over huge rocks, and encircling
                  the verdurous islands scattered over its bosom, rose from the foliage of May the
                  single fine dwelling house of the town, "Belvidere," some time the residence of
                  Colonel William Byrd, whose large warehouse for tobacco rose above the village. On
                  the opposite hill, to the east, the old church of St. John peeped from the forest,
                  and was gilded by the brilliant sunlight.</p>
               <p>As the young man passed on through the row of log houses, with their wooden
                  chimneys, against which an ordinance had been lately passed, he saw
                  representatives of every clime almost. There were Dutch and Portuguese from sloops
                  in the river, negroes just landed from Africa, and vagrant Indians come to
                  purchase rum with their furs. The Africans spoke their native dialect, and the
                  rest a broken patois, and the numerous goats swarming in the streets, and peering
                  into every thing, added their bleating to the hubbub.</p>
               <p>Almost every class and tongue was represented in the streets, from the swaggering
                  foreign sailor to the well-bred gentleman in his coach, and the small village,
                  usually so obscure, had become almost a city on this the day of the fair.</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John pushed his way onward, through men, and women, and children, and
                  goats, and reached the door of the tavern, a long building overflowing with
                  revelers.</p>
               <p>He had his animals baited, and then applied himself vigorously to the substantial
                  viands set respectfully before him by mine host of the "Rising Sun." Having
                  satisfied his material wants, he issued forth and looked around him on the hubbub
                  of the fair.</p>
               <p>It was a sufficiently entertaining sight, and worthy of the pencil of Hogarth.
                  Unfortunately, we do not possess the burin of that great humorous genius, and must
                  content ourselves with saying that those favorite deities of Virginia, Fun and
                  Frolic, seemed to be ruling the great crowd despotically.</p>
               <p>This crowd was, as we have said, of every possible description of personage—from
                  the wealthy and richly dressed Virginia planter, to the traveling showman
                  announcing, in discordant accents, like a bull of Bashan, from the opening of his
                  canvas booth, the wonders of his three-headed pig, or his greyhound with eight
                  legs.</p>
               <p>The great master of the science of thimble-rig here puzzled the rustic
                  clod-hoppers with his feats of legerdemain; a step further, a serene and solemn
                  gentleman was stationed in the rear of a table covered with a figured cloth, on
                  which a number of pistoles would be laid down by betters, to be raked immediately
                  into Mr. Sweatcloth's pouch; still, a step further, an Italian boy turned
                  summersets, and sang and played with his monkey, and from the crowd assembled
                  round these various spectacles, and games, and exhibitions, came a ceaseless buzz
                  of talk and laughter, rising at times into a shout almost, and deafening the ears
                  with joyous discord.</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John pushed his way through the crowd, exchanging greetings with a hundred
                  acquaintances, and entered the grounds of the fair proper.</p>
               <p>Here it was no longer confusion only—it was Babel. A specimen brick, so to speak,
                  had been brought from the edifices of dealers in all imaginable commodities, and
                  Mr. St. John found himself assailed on a dozen sides, in as many moments, by the
                  merchants.</p>
               <p>Would his honor like this fine saddle? or perhaps this handsome cloth? But before
                  the victim could reply, he was entreated, by the merchant opposite, to purchase a
                  full set of variegated china.</p>
               <p>Would he look at these buckskin knee-breeches, as fine and pliable as satin? And
                  no sooner had Mr. St. John declined the knee-breeches, than a country lass offered
                  him a set of frilled shirts, which seemed to have been made with especial
                  reference to the foam of the sea, so elaborate and immense were the ruffles.</p>
               <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6146-00000069"/>
               <p>The young man put aside every thing, laughing, and went through the whole grounds
                  uncaptured. He paused beside more than one chariot to pay his respects to young
                  ladies, and finally found himself opposite the judge of the races on the ensuing
                  day.</p>
               <p>The judge was a portly gentleman, of about thirty, with a large bundle of watch
                  seals, an enormous frill, and a bearing at once dignified and agreeable. He wore a
                  huge peruke, fine buckskin breeches, and fairtop boots with spurs—boots covering
                  feet of the dimensions of kneading troughs.</p>
               <p>His large hands were encased in gloves, and the right glove held the handle of a
                  riding whip, ornamented with silver.</p>
               <p>When this worthy saw Mr. St. John, he made him a profound bow, but immediately
                  raised his head with dignity.</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Lugg," said St. John, shaking hands in a friendly way, "I have come to
                  enter some horses. How are the lists?"</p>
               <p>"Pretty well filled, Mr. St. John," replied Mr. Lugg, saluting an humble passer by
                  in a friendly and condescending way; "pretty full, sir, but we 're glad to have as
                  many entries for the purse as possible."</p>
               <p>"I forewarn you—Belsize or Serapis will win it."</p>
               <p>"That 's as it may be, sir, for there are some beauties entered."</p>
               <p>"Have you any horse?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir—that is, a mare. If there 's a question connected with her, of course I
                  do n't act as judge."</p>
               <p>"Exactly. What 's her name?"</p>
               <p>"I call her Donsy, sir—after my lady. A thorough-bred, by Selim, the Arabian of my
                  friend, Captain Waters, out of Juliet, whom I purchased of my friend and neighbor,
                  Mr. Champ Effingham. He wished to make me a present of the mare, but of course I
                  could n't accept."</p>
               <p>And Mr. Lugg raised his head with dignity.</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John smiled, and asked his companion to come and look at his horses, and
                  see Mr. Gunn with him—this latter gentleman being the manager of the races.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lugg obeyed with alacrity, and more than once returned a salute from a
                  gentleman riding by—holding Mr. St. John's arm.</p>
               <p>They went to the race course, which was in an old field, toward the east, and to
                  the stables.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lugg, and his friend Gunn, expatiated at length upon the merits of the
                  different horses, and bestowed discriminating praise upon Belsize and Serapis, who
                  had already been entered by Mr. St. John's servant.</p>
               <p>They then returned, conversing, to the inn.</p>
               <p>Night fell upon the fair, but it did not diminish the revelry. In the great room
                  of the "Rising Sun," especially, was the uproar perfectly tremendous.</p>
               <p>When Mr. St. John entered this apartment, his attention was attracted by a figure
                  mounted on the great table, high above the immense roaring crowd, which figure
                  shook in his hand a parchment, and, with violent gesticulations, demanded to be
                  heard.</p>
               <p>At last Mr. St. John made out that the orator was offering the title deed of a lot
                  in the town of Richmond, to any one who would treat the crowd, himself included,
                  to a bowl of punch, of the best Scotch whiskey.</p>
               <p>The young man looked on, curiously, to see what success this offer would meet
                  with, and his patience was rewarded.</p>
               <p>A little personage with a tie-wig jostled through the crowd, and took and examined
                  the parchment. The examination seemed satisfactory, and the gentleman in the wig
                  signified his willingness to close with the owner's proposition.</p>
               <p>The crowd received the speech with shouts of applause, and mine host was ordered
                  to brew an ocean of punch, the offer being unlimited.</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John saw the gentleman in the tie-wig roll up the title-deed and retire,
                  after speaking to the landlord; and then the young man retired too, fatigued with
                  his ride.</p>
               <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6146-00000070"/>
               <p>As to the parchment thus purchased, it was the title-deed of the square upon which
                  St. Paul's Church now stands, in the city of Richmond.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
               <head type="sub">IN WHICH THE AUTHOR OMITS DESCRIBING THE RACES.</head>
               <p>WE have said that nothing but the pencil of Hogarth could depict the humors of the
                  streets of Richmond town, when Mr. St. John arrived.</p>
               <p>We add, that even this great humorist would have had his powers taxed to their
                  utmost by the scenes on the racecourse upon the following day.</p>
               <p>We shall scarcely attempt to outline them, for we feel how powerless would be the
                  endeavor. It is enough to say that the old field presented the appearance of
                  Pandemonium broke loose; that cock-fights, dog-fights, rat and terrier combats,
                  and human fisticuff engagements, were the lesser and more unimpressive details of
                  what seemed a tremendous orgy.</p>
               <p>The crowd was huger, the traveling gamblers more indefatigable, the Italian and
                  his monkey turned wilder summersets, and through this mass of "low life" and
                  revelry, a thrill of delight and expectation seemed to run, which changed to
                  resounding acclamations when the horses were led forth.</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John, by express kindness of his friend, L. Lugg, Esquire, chief judge,
                  was accommodated with a seat in the judges' stand—a little round tower, fronting
                  the balcony, and looking down upon the concourse.</p>
               <p>The young man gazed with that interest and curiosity, which is said to be peculiar
                  to Virginians, upon the spectacle.</p>
               <p>Beneath him the crowd reeled and flowed to and fro in waves; rich chariots shot by
                  like stars, full of little beauties in diamonds and lace, or portly old fellows in
                  enormous ruffles; the dog-fights, cock-fights, man-fights, went on in a ceaseless
                  uproar.</p>
               <p>Above and fronting him was a spectacle somewhat different. In the wide balcony a
                  mass of dames and gentlemen resembled, with their variegated costumes, a blooming
                  flower-garden; and the sparkling eyes, red cheeks, and lips ever smiling,
                  indicated how much pleasure the young ladies expected from the race.</p>
               <p>Alas! for the cause of morality and solemnity! 'T is much the same, says our
                  author, in all ages. Whether princess or young lady, damsel or lass of the mill,
                  they, one and all, are the same foolish, giddy creatures! They all love fine
                  dresses, and colors of the rainbow! They thrill one and all at a festival or
                  jubilee! They like gallants, and admiration, and pretty speeches, and amusement!
                  and I do n't think, Sir Diogenes, they are heathen!</p>
               <p>The horses are led up and down through the crowd—the cock-fights, dog-fights,
                  man-fights, disappear—a thrill of admiration even runs through the bevy of fair
                  girls.</p>
               <p>The horses are stripped and saddled. They are the cream of Virginia racers, and
                  they know what they are expected to perform.</p>
               <p>The boys are tossed into the saddle, the drum tapped, and the animals vanish from
                  the stand like meteors on the circular track.</p>
               <p>It is not our intention to dwell on the details of the races, or on the singular
                  and laughable scenes which followed them. If the reader would see that jolly
                  period rise up from the mists of oblivion, renew its faded colors, and unroll its
                  wide tapestry of fun and revelry; if he would know how our ancestors amused
                  themselves and carried on, he has only to consult the "Virginia Gazette," and the
                  advertisement of the frolic on St. Andrew's day, at Captain John Bickerton's old
                  field in Hanover, to see the whole spectacle again. He will<pb n="140-141"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000071"/> see how the hat worth twenty shillings was cudgeled
                  for; how a violin was played for, and then how they all played different tunes at
                  once; how a quire of ballads was sung for, and silver buckles wrestled for, and a
                  pair of handsome shoes and stockings danced for—the stockings to be given to the
                  prettiest girl upon the ground.</p>
               <p>All this the honest and veracious old "Gazette" sets forth—every other word
                  commencing with a capital—and there we read it all to-day. How can the poor
                  chronicler depict it? He listens with respectful attention to the fiddlers, and
                  hears the maidens' voices singing for the book of ballads, and bows to the
                  prettiest girl upon the ground, who got the stockings—bows low, quite careless
                  whether she be diamond decorated maiden or poor country lass, caring to know
                  nothing but her beauty. The chronicler thus hears, and sees, and laughs, and looks
                  down on the rout, or up to the balcony, with its starry eyes—but that is all. He
                  can not describe you, bright young men and maidens! though he hears your mirth and
                  laughter chiming through the mists of the century that is gone. He drops the
                  corner of the curtain he has raised for a moment, and passes onward, smiling.</p>
               <p>We shall not further dwell upon the races, or the fair, but simply say that, on
                  the following morning, Mr. St. John ordered "Tallyho," and turned his face toward
                  Williamsburg.</p>
               <p>The following note, however, went back, with Serapis and Belsize, to Vanely:</p>

               <p>Having delivered this note to the negro, Mr. St. John got into the saddle, and
                  pushed his way through the crowd, toward the hill upon which stood old St. John's
                  Church.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
               <head type="sub">HOW MR. ST. JOHN ENCOUNTERED A STRANGER, AND OF WHAT THEY
                  CONVERSED.</head>
               <p>THE road which the young man pursued led around the hill in a sort of curving
                  ascent, and passing by the church of St. John, debouched from the town in the
                  direction of "Bloody Run," where Bacon had defeated the Indian army a hundred
                  years before.</p>
               <p>He looked back upon the town, as he arrived at the summit, and was so much
                  impressed by the beauty of the landscape that he dismounted, and tied his horse to
                  the bough of a tree, and entered the grounds of the church, seeking for the
                  highest point of view.</p>
               <p>He found this in the immediate vicinity of the old edifice, and threading his way
                  among the tombstones of three generations, paused upon a grassy hillock, and
                  feasted his eyes upon the scene.</p>
               <p>It is beautiful to-day—it was far more lovely then. The majestic river, far
                  beneath him, poured its waves from the western hills around islands of dipping
                  foliage, and over rocks which broke its waters into foam, and then, tired of this
                  contention, flowed away in serene majesty toward the sea. Far away to the south,
                  it wound into view again, the white sails of barks glittering on its bosom against
                  the green forest—that immense forest which seemed to clasp the whole landscape in
                  its embrace. At the foot of the high hill, scattered along the brook, were the
                  houses of the town, and in the west rose the walls of Belvidere, embowered in
                  foliage, and<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6146-00000072"/> looking down serenely on
                  the village. Over the whole scene drooped the warm and golden atmosphere, and a
                  great pile of clouds, like snow drift, floated away toward the southern
                  horizon.</p>
               <p>The beautiful spectacle was not without its effect upon the young man, whose mind
                  and heart, for a moment diverted by the scenes of the fair, now returned with new
                  pleasure to his possessing thought.</p>
               <p>It was the face of a girl which he saw in the clouds and the mirror-like river; it
                  was her voice which he heard in the murmur of the breeze, and the mellow music of
                  the laughing water, foaming over moss-clad rocks. Her image had been obscured by
                  the grotesque scenes, and the passion and uproar of the race-course; now, however,
                  he was alone with nature, and in the midst of purity and peace, her beautiful face
                  came back to him, and filled his heart with gladness.</p>
               <p>The erect brows of the young man drooped; he leaned against the trunk of one of
                  the old trees, and lowering his eyes, fixed them with idle and dreamy pleasure on
                  the flowery sward.</p>
               <p>He remained thus silent and absorbed, scarcely conscious of the outer world, for
                  nearly an hour—absorbed in one of those reveries which come at times to all. Place
                  and time had disappeared—he was alone with his love.</p>
               <p>He was aroused by a distant muttering of thunder, and by a heavy drop of rain
                  falling upon his face.</p>
               <p>He looked up. The whole scene had changed. Heavy clouds obscured the sky, fringed
                  beneath by a long, ragged line of fire; and as he gazed, the far horizon was
                  illuminated by successive flashes of lurid lightning, which shone, with dazzling
                  brilliancy, against the black masses of the thunder clouds. The May morning had
                  been obscured thus suddenly by one of those thunder storms which rush into the
                  skies of Virginia, at this season of the year, with scarcely a moment's warning,
                  and the brooding darkness, which advanced, like a giant towering from earth to
                  heaven, over river, and field, and forest, proved that the storm about to burst
                  would be one of no ordinary violence.</p>
               <p>The young man had scarcely taken in with a glance the state of things, when the
                  heavy drops began to patter more rapidly through the trees; a huge wall,
                  apparently, of mist advanced rapidly from the west, and accompanied by vivid
                  lightning flashes, and deafening peals of thunder, as its heralds, the storm was
                  upon him.</p>
               <p>He threw a glance toward "Tallyho," who was sheltered somewhat by the great oak,
                  beneath which he was tied, and then hastened to the door of the church for
                  shelter.</p>
               <p>He struck it with his hand, and fortunately it was open. He entered just at the
                  moment when the storm roared down upon the hill, lashing it with all its power,
                  and making the building shake and quiver.</p>
               <p>St. John found himself in an old edifice, almost dark, and at first he scarcely
                  saw his way.</p>
               <p>The windows were for the most part closed, but through those which remained open
                  the dazzling flashes of lightning streamed fearfully, preluding roars of thunder
                  like a thousand cannon.</p>
               <p>The young man had advanced toward the tub-shaped pulpit, and was standing with one
                  hand upon the railing of the chancel, when he heard issue, as it were, from
                  beneath his feet, the words,</p>
               <p>"A dangerous thunder-storm, sir; you are fortunate in finding refuge from it."</p>
               <p>He started and turned round. At the same moment, a vivid flash of lightning lit up
                  the building, and a step beneath him, in the door of the vestry-room, St. John
                  discovered the figure of a man, clad in somber and severe black.</p>
               <p>It was the singular individual whom we have seen in the tall, tower-like edifice
                  in Williamsburg—in the underground printing office—beneath the boughs of the
                  forest—and in the chamber of his child, as he prepared to set forth on his
                  midnight journey.</p>
               <p>His appearance had not changed. There was the same<pb n="144-145"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000073"/> expression of iron calmness, the same steady fire
                  in the dark eyes, the same air, as of one who is possessed by an intellectual
                  fanaticism, an absorbing idea, which never for a moment disappears front his
                  mind.</p>
               <p>St. John gazed for a moment at the pale face, and the nervous figure, which seemed
                  like a collection of steel springs. He was trying to remember where he had met
                  with the stranger before. That he had encountered him somewhere, he was perfectly
                  well assured. But where? The attempt to recall the time or place was vain; he gave
                  up the search.</p>
               <p>To the deep-toned words of the stranger, he replied,</p>
               <p>"Yes, a dangerous storm, sir; pardon my staring at you so very rudely, but I
                  fancied we had met before."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps," said the stranger, gravely.</p>
               <p>"Your appearance in the darkness somewhat startled me. I had expected to find this
                  old building vacant, and almost recoiled when you spoke from the shadow."</p>
               <p>"I confess my appearance was somewhat melo-dramatic," replied the stranger,
                  advancing from the door with a measured movement, "but my presence here, like
                  yours, is very simple."</p>
               <p>"I took refuge from the storm."</p>
               <p>"And I came to look at this building."</p>
               <p>St. John's look denoted that he had failed to understand.</p>
               <p>"You wished to see the church?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir—its capacity."</p>
               <p>"Its capacity?"</p>
               <p>"In other words, sir," said the stranger, "how many persons could assemble within
                  its walls."</p>
               <p>"Yes,"said the young man, "I think I understand. There is to be an ecclesiastical
                  convention."</p>
               <p>"I have not heard of it, sir."</p>
               <p>"What then?"</p>
               <p>"A convention of persons employed in other matters, perhaps. Possibly a meeting of
                  the Burgesses."</p>
               <p>"The Burgesses?"</p>
               <p>"Why not?"</p>
               <p>"I thought that honorable body sat in Williamsburg, sir."</p>
               <p>The stranger was silent for a moment, and during this pause, his dark eyes,
                  piercing and brilliant, and full of gloomy earnestness, fixed themselves upon the
                  face of his companion.</p>
               <p>"Williamsburg is truly the present place of meeting of the Burgesses," he said in
                  his deep voice, "but do you think they will sit there long?"</p>
               <p>"Ah! I understand—you refer to Lord Dunmore?"</p>
               <p>The stranger nodded.</p>
               <p>"You mean that he will coerce them?"</p>
               <p>"Is it very improbable?"</p>
               <p>"It is just the contrary."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, sir," said the stranger, thoughtfully, "do you think it strange that
                  another place besides Williamsburg is looked to? But, your pardon. Perhaps I speak
                  to a gentleman having no sympathy with the cause—to one connected with Lord
                  Dunmore?"</p>
               <p>At that name the young man's face had already clouded over, and his eyes assumed
                  an expression of disdain and menace.</p>
               <p>"Yes," he said, coldly, "I am connected with his lordship."</p>
               <p>The stranger made a movement of his head.</p>
               <p>"I am lieutenant of his 'guards,' so styled."</p>
               <p>"I can not congratulate you, sir," said the stranger, gloomily, "but I have
                  nothing to say."</p>
               <p>"I have something to add, however," returned St. John, disdainfully, "and it is
                  this, sir: that I cordially despise his Excellency, and throw the commission I've
                  held in his face!"</p>
               <p>The stranger advanced a step, his gloomy look changing to one of animation.</p>
               <p>"You do not then approve of this gentleman?" he said.</p>
               <p>"I deny that he 's a particle of a gentleman!" returned the young man, coldly; "he
                  's a vulgar fellow, and if he asks me my opinion, I'll tell him so!"</p>
               <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6146-00000074"/>
               <p>The stranger's face glowed.</p>
               <p>"Then you are of the opposition, sir?" he said in his deep voice.</p>
               <p>"To the death!"</p>
               <p>"You are a patriot?"</p>
               <p>"I know not what you mean by the word," returned St. John, coldly; "if, however,
                  it signifies a man who regards the legislation of Parliament as odious and
                  despotic; who would war to the death against the tyrannical enactments let loose
                  upon Virginia, like a brood of cormorants; above all, who would gladly march at
                  the head of a regiment to drive this man, Dunmore, from the capital of the
                  province, and lash him like a hound from our borders—if this is what you call
                  being a patriot, sir, I 'm one to all lengths!"</p>
               <p>As the young man spoke in his bold and earnest voice, with its disdainful and
                  passionate sternness, the form of the stranger seemed to dilate with satisfaction,
                  his strange eyes grew more brilliant, and his pale cheek was tinged with a slight
                  color.</p>
               <p>He advanced and said:</p>
               <p>"Then you would oppose Parliament?"</p>
               <p>"To the bitter end!"</p>
               <p>"You would resist the execution of its acts in the province?"</p>
               <p>"With arms, if necessary!"</p>
               <p>"You would levy war against the Governor."</p>
               <p>"As cheerfully as a bridegroom assembles his friends to ride to his wedding!"</p>
               <p>The stranger seemed to glow with gloomy satisfaction as he listened to these
                  disdainful words. But he restrained himself.</p>
               <p>"Do you know that the words you have uttered are dangerous?" he said.</p>
               <p>"Perfectly," said St. John.</p>
               <p>"That I may be a spy and informer?"</p>
               <p>"I care not."</p>
               <p>"That the Governor may arrest you and send you to rot in a prison ship, or swing
                  from Tyburn tree, by the verdict of an English jury?"</p>
               <p>"Stop!" said St. John, as coldly as before; "there you are mistaken, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Mistaken?"</p>
               <p>"You lose sight of one thing—the fact that I wear a sword! and that before the
                  tools of Dunmore arrest me—"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes?"</p>
               <p>"I will drive it to the hilt in his cowardly breast!" said St. John, carried away
                  with rage; "if I 'm hanged for treason it shall be for something! But this is
                  idle, sir. I talk like a school-boy, and I get blood-thirsty. I mean that my
                  contempt for this man is so deep, my jealousy of parliamentary misrule so strong,
                  my blood so hot with the cause of this, our native land, that I 'd cheerfully take
                  the first step in high treason to defeat our enemies—stake my head upon the game,
                  and abide by the result!"</p>
               <p>The stranger seemed to listen to these words with stern delight, and his eyes
                  burned with the fires of internal excitement.</p>
               <p>He advanced two steps, and enclosing the young man's hand in a grasp of iron,
                  said, in his deep, resounding voice:</p>
               <p>"I offer you the clasp of amity, friend, and recognize in you a brother and
                  coworker! I see in your eyes, your voice, the expression of your lips, what I 'd
                  trust my life to sooner than distrust it!"</p>
               <p>"You may," replied St. John, coldly; "I am not one to hide any thing."</p>
               <p>"I see that plainly!" said the stranger, "and it is men like yourself that we
                  want—bold natures and strong hands. Do not think that I flatter you, sir—there is
                  no man living I will flatter. I speak simply when I say that you have interested
                  and moved me, as few persons have moved me for years. But even in this moment of
                  full sympathy, let me still ask if these views are deliberate, and not the
                  result—"</p>
               <p>"Of private feelings!" said St. John, mastered in spite of<pb n="148-149"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000075"/> himself by the gloomy earnestness of the stranger;
                  "is that your meaning, sir?"</p>
               <p>The stranger nodded.</p>
               <p>"I reply that a private feeling toward the Governor has had some weight with me,
                  but my opinions were formed before. They are summed up in this—that Virginia is
                  being crushed! that we, free-born men, are being rapidly enslaved, that our chains
                  are being forged, and my remedy is war!"</p>
               <p>The stranger listened with an avidity which glowed in his eyes, and seemed to send
                  the blood more rapidly through his veins.</p>
               <p>"You say well, sir," he replied in a voice which swelled and grew deeper and more
                  gloomy as he spoke; "you have uttered the single word which expresses the whole
                  truth of the times. Yes, we free-born Virginians are becoming slaves—serfs! the
                  serfs of a mean and ignoble Parliament full of representatives from rotten
                  boroughs, and advancing to tread upon the necks of these provinces. The serfs of a
                  Governor, coarse, treacherous and bloody, whose very presence on our soil taints
                  it, and makes it tremble with disgust. You have nobly spoken, sir. Your voice has
                  uttered those noble thoughts which tremble, as we stand here, on a thousand
                  tongues, but are silenced by this tyranny beneath which we groan; which is
                  crushing our free spirits and making us those most miserable creatures, the slaves
                  of a phantom—an idea!"</p>
               <p>As the stranger spoke, his voice grew deeper still and full of menace; his hands
                  moved, and seemed to tremble with disdain.</p>
               <p>"How long? how long?" he said, "this is the cry of the new generation, unfettered
                  by the past or the present, and looking to the future. This new generation I look
                  to as my stay and my hope—I who live in and draw my heart's blood from the breath
                  of revolution! The word startles the old generation—it is the watch-word, the
                  battle cry of the new! Look at my face, sir! the wrinkles that begin to diverge
                  from my eyes—they are the result of ten years of conflict, of ten years, in which
                  I have toiled and nearly worn myself out in pushing onward, through evil report
                  and good, through darkness and gloom, the car of a revolution which shall break
                  and overturn, and crush beneath its wheels what oppresses us! I speak as I have
                  the right to speak. I tell of the darkness through which I have passed, wherein
                  scarely a star shone to guide me. But thanks to the Supreme Ruler of the destinies
                  of humanity, the gloom begins at last to disappear, the day of liberty to
                  dawn.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," continued the stranger, his lofty stature seeming to increase as he
                  spoke, "the day begins to dawn on our western world, and the powers of the night
                  to be dethroned. For generations it has lain in darkness, and the horrible
                  vultures have fed upon its bowels, tearing out its vitals and burying obscene
                  talons in its noble heart. But that heart is not cold—the heart of Virginia is
                  still alive—it throbs and it rises! You may see the prostrate form begin to
                  quiver! see the shudder which runs through the gigantic frame! it trembles and
                  pants, and, like Lazarus, rises from its grave! like Samson, it will shiver into
                  atoms the chains which fetter its mighty limbs! When that body rises to its feet
                  from the living grave in which a horrible and murderous tyranny has engulfed it,
                  the solid earth will shake beneath its tread, and the waters of the very sea will
                  boil. Wo then to the vultures of tyranny! Wo to Dunmore, to Gage, to the king on
                  his throne, in that hour! The atmosphere is even now charged with hatred, the
                  lightnings of years of oppression will fall on our tyrants to brand and paralyze
                  them, with the false and lying hounds they have let loose to tear us!</p>
               <p>"You gaze at me with wonder, sir," continued the stranger, "but if you knew what I
                  have passed through, you would not be astonished. I who speak, sir, as I feel
                  myself compelled to speak, by an influence I can not resist—I who speak to you,
                  have no thought, no existence, no heart, but Virginia! Whatever strikes her
                  strikes me, what arrests the life-blood in her veins paralyzes mine; what she
                     thrills<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6146-00000076"/> and trembles with sends a
                  shudder through my frame! For ten years I have had no other life—for ten years I
                  have been burnt up by one eternal dominant idea, and that idea is summed up in the
                  word—Revolution! For this I have toiled—to unfetter the human mind has been my
                  mission. If I am worn out, as I nearly am, what matter? If I brand the tyranny of
                  Parliament—if I help to tear out the lying tongues, and overthrow the power of a
                  hateful and disgusting oppression—if I even advance the phalanx one step toward
                  our enemies—then I shall go to my grave with joy, for my end will be accomplished.
                  There is little in life to attract me," continued the speaker, who paused, as it
                  were, and with drooping brows, gazed toward the ground, "for at the prime of
                  manhood, I am old—when my life should be bursting into flower, I am alone."</p>
               <p>There was such profound and gloomy sadness in the tones of the deep voice, that
                  St. John gazed at his companion with deep sympathy.</p>
               <p>"You have suffered, sir?" he said.</p>
               <p>"Deeply," said the stranger, in a low voice.</p>
               <p>"A long time?"</p>
               <p>"For a decade—the period of my labor."</p>
               <p>St. John was silent, and the stranger for some moments was silent too. Then he
                  raised his head, and two tears moistened his fiery eyes, but were instantly dashed
                  away.</p>
               <p>He laid his hand upon St. John's shoulder, and for some moments gazed at him with
                  an expression at once so piercing and so sorrowful that the young man remembered
                  it for years.</p>
               <p>"It is strange," he said, "but I feel an irresistible desire to confide in you,
                  friend. Can I? I think I can."</p>
               <p>"Any thing communicated to me shall be locked in my bosom," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"Your word is then given that what I say shall be repeated to no one?"</p>
               <p>"To no one upon earth."</p>
               <p>"Then listen, sir," said she stranger, in his deep, sorrowful voice, "listen and I
                  will relate to you the history of a life."</p>

               <head type="sub">HOW THE STRANGER BECAME AN HISTORIAN AND A PROPHET.</head>
               <p>THE stranger had scarcely uttered the words, when a dazzling flash of lightning
                  darted across the sky, was immediately succeeded by a roar of thunder, like the
                  discharge of a battery, and one of the great oaks, upon which the bolt fell, was
                  split and shivered, from the top to the bottom, by the fiery stream.</p>
               <p>For a moment the eyes of the two men were dazzled by the terrible spectacle, and
                  they gazed at the torn trunk, which, encumbered with broken boughs, was fitfully
                  seen by successive flashes, or chance gleams.</p>
               <p>"Do you see this tree thus shattered by lightning?" said the stranger; "well, that
                  is the type of a man's life—of the life which speaks to you now.</p>
               <p>"Ten years ago," he continued, "there lived in Virginia a warm-hearted, ardent,
                  and impressible youth. The soul of this youth throbbed with generous emotions, and
                  such was his frankness, and tenderness, and kindness, that he could not have
                  trodden upon a worm or an insect. His dream was to do good, to ameliorate the
                  condition of humanity, to unfetter and enlighten his brethren, and give them
                  liberty of thought, self respect, and happiness. To this end all his studies
                  tended, and he lived in a dream, as it were, of love and philanthropy.</p>
               <p>"Such was his state of mind, and such his hope, when he met with a woman—a woman
                  of rare and overpowering loveliness, and by a strange accident, this woman, or
                  rather girl, was proved to be his cousin. Almost the first moment in which he saw
                  her sealed his fate; from that instant he loved; loved deeply, passionately,
                  absorbingly. She returned his affection, and that new world which he had
                  imagined—the world of beauty and truth—seemed to center and find its realization
                  in her love and her presence."</p>
               <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6146-00000077"/>
               <p>The stranger paused for a moment, but continued, calmly,</p>
               <p>"This love became a portion of his life, of his being, of his soul. Before, he had
                  found in the great thoughts of the kings of literature, sufficient food for his
                  mind, and in their grand ideas he had wrapped himself so completely, that he
                  lived, as it were, in history, and asked nothing more. But now all was changed; he
                  no longer dreamed of the progress and enlightenment of man; the happiness and
                  destiny of mankind was no longer a thought to him. He had found something grander
                  than the fate of the world, a more absorbing passion than philanthropy; he had
                  found a woman's heart to clasp to his own, a heart whose beating made him careless
                  of the past or the future, so that future were spent in her presence, by her
                  side.</p>
               <p>"I said," continued the stranger, "that this woman loved him. O yes, she loved
                  him! Rare and wonderful decree of a Deity of love and goodness! the imperishable
                  treasure of this woman's heart was given solely to himself. To speak of her is
                  idle, words fade and fail me; 't is enough to say that she was such as he had
                  never seen before, and will never see again—no never! Well, well, sir, I linger;
                  let me go on with my narrative. The man and the woman were married; they went far
                  away to the vast solitudes, and there, in the presence of nature and the Creator,
                  they were wholly, completely, blissfully happy—happy as human beings can seldom
                  be, and never for long, because earth would then be like heaven."</p>
               <p>These recollections seemed almost to unnerve the stranger, but he suppressed his
                  emotion and continued,</p>
               <p>"Well, I will not dwell on this further. Let me hurry on. The man and the woman
                  lived a year thus, tranquil and serene, and then the bolt of Heaven fell. God saw
                  fit to take away this woman," said the stranger, hoarsely, "to lead back the man
                  to his neglected work. He no longer recognized his mission, for he was happy; he
                  had forgotten his duty. The Deity decreed that he should come away, and the means
                  which he used were the fires of grief and anguish. Well, sir, all this came about
                  as was decreed. The blow fell, and the trunk was stripped of its verdure and
                  freshness—stripped for ever. The hard <emph>heart</emph> alone remained, and this
                  sufficed for the work. The man came on foot one day to the capital; he was dusty
                  and worn with fatigue; he saw flame and breathed agony and despair. He raised his
                  head, and was accosted by a former companion, who harshly upbraided him for his
                  inaction, and in words of fire laid before him his future work. There was a great
                  crowd assembled, every heart throbbed with rage and defiance toward England;
                  before he knew it, he was speaking to them by the red glare of the burning stamps,
                  and from that moment he comprehended the behest of Providence. He had neglected
                  his mission; he was led back and thrust into the ranks to do his part.</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, from that time forth he became what he is, what you see him, a machine
                  of iron, with but one eternal idea burning like fire in his soul. His work was to
                  aid in unfettering the human soul—when that is accomplished he will disappear.
                  When I have no longer any work to do, when my aim is accomplished, my memory will
                  kill me. But that will not take place; I shall fall by the sword, or the cannon
                  ball, or bayonet—it matters not—and the day which sees me stretched cold and pale
                  upon the battle field, will be the happiest of my life, for on that day I trust to
                  rejoin my wife!"</p>
               <p>The stranger paused, and wiped his forehead, which was steaming with cold sweat.
                  By an immense effort he suppressed the shudder which ran through his frame, and
                  his features subsided gradually into iron calmness.</p>
               <p>"You may think it strange, sir," he said, coldly, to the young man, who had
                  listened with deep sympathy to this narrative; "you may think it strange that I
                  have thus unrolled the history of my life, as it were, to a person whom I do not
                  know. But such is the human mind. Philosophy and self control are mighty bulwarks,
                  but at times the crushed heart will writhe and moan beneath the iron heel.
                     There<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6146-00000078"/> are moments when human
                  sympathy is necessary even to my shattered soul, and this feeling has been too
                  much for me to-day. Perhaps I have spoken to unsympathizing ears, but I could not
                  refrain, sir—the words have been uttered."</p>
               <p>St. John said, with great feeling,</p>
               <p>"I have listened with respect, sir, and sympathy, and do not, I pray you, believe
                  that your suffering finds an indifferent listener in myself. If 't were only from
                  curiosity, I must have heard you with attention, for you relate a strange and
                  moving story! But it is with more than curiosity that I have listened—with
                  sympathy and deference, sir; that deference which is due to a great
                  misfortune."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, friend," said the stranger, more calmly even than before; "your face is
                  so loyal and sincere that I scarcely regret my indiscretion. Well, to finish. From
                  the moment when I saw what my work was, I have been in harness. I have aimed
                  further than protest against parliamentary despotism, I have aimed at perfect
                  independence and—a republic."</p>
               <p>"Ah! a republic?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing less, sir," said the stranger, calmly. "For ten years nearly I have been
                  stirring up this colony to an armed revolt—a rebellion."</p>
               <p>St. John mused with drooping head.</p>
               <p>"I see that you question the possibility of this movement now," said the stranger,
                  "and I regret that my time will not permit me to expand my views of the past. See
                  one thing, however. As you, at this moment, are in advance of thousands of the
                  most intelligent and patriotic thinkers upon government, as you would meet
                  Parliament in arms, and lash the tyrannical Dunmore from Virginia, so, ten years
                  ago, I was in advance of yourself. In that time I have watched, with attentive
                  eyes, the progress of thought, the expansion of men's minds. They approach nearer
                  and nearer to me every hour. I do not boast, sir, for God gave me my eyes and my
                  soul, pointed out my work. What I saw, near a dozen years since, will be acted,
                  perhaps, in twelve months from this time. The stamps were burned in the year '65;
                  that was the firing of the slow match. It is nearly burnt out. In the next year,
                  the year '75, it will reach the powder, and the mine will explode with a crash
                  which shall bury the throne, in America at least, in ruins, from which nothing can
                  dig it forth."</p>
               <p>The speaker's eyes glowed as he spoke, and his nervous hand was stretched out
                  unconsciously.</p>
               <p>"It is this for which I have worked," he continued, in his deep, iron tone, "and
                  how I have worked, I will tell you, for I trust you implicitly. From Williamsburg,
                  the center, I have disseminated into the remotest counties, the thoughts of a body
                  of men, whose mouth-piece I am. They supply the means, I give them my life. We
                  have organized committees of vigilance in a hundred places, and, traveling day and
                  night, I have thrown myself everywhere in contact with the heart of the people,
                  feeling its pulsations, and endeavoring to infuse into it the thoughts of my own
                  mind, and the minds of my associates. I have means given me for private expresses,
                  and many days before the Boston Harbor bill was published in Williamsburg, we were
                  arousing the whole province with this new outrage. Under three royal governors,
                  the press has been busy within a step of their doors, and scattering broadcast
                  what it is treason to print. Fauquier was feasting and card-playing, Botetourt
                  hoping for better times; they did not arrest it. Dunmore has placed all his hounds
                  on the trail, but as yet they have not caught the game. I think I am worth a good
                  sum to the informer who will arrest me, and furnish the proof of my treason. That
                  I am a traitor to the government, under the 25th Edward III., there is not the
                  least doubt, and you may call the association the <emph>League of Treason</emph>
                  with perfect propriety. That I know to whom I speak, I prove to you, sir, by
                  entering into these details. For ten years I have thus been the instrument of a
                  system, and of an organized body. Their work is to arouse the mind of Virginia,
                  and the other provinces, to an armed rebellion. We have hailed every new blow<pb
                     n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6146-00000079"/> struck by the Parliament with profound
                  and unfeigned delight; we have longed and yearned for the final and decisive act;
                  we have invited the stamp of the heel which shall spur into madness the
                  down-trodden masses; which shall make them writhe upward and sting! The Culpeper
                  minute-men will take for their motto the words, 'Do n't tread on me!' over a
                  rattlesnake; the association which I represent, have another and a different
                  motto—'Tread on us and grind us! outrage us, treat us as slaves! insult us, spit
                  on us, exhaust our whole patience, till we rouse from our apathy and sting you to
                  death!' Do you think we are blundering? Do you mistake our design? Do you imagine
                  we are wrong in hailing joyfully this new 'Port Bill?' That act is the beginning
                  of the end! Ten years ago, I spoke with a man of gigantic mind, one of those fiery
                  souls breathing but in revolution, born to wield the thunderbolt of oratory, to
                  ride on and direct the storm. 'Let us strike!' were his words, 'come! a
                  revolution!' I replied, 'You are wrong—you desire to strike the blow before we
                  have arms in our hands; let us enlighten the minds of the people, let us arm them,
                  let us train them, and keep silent and wait!' The name of this man was Patrick
                  Henry, and his sentiments were shared by another great intellect, Thomas Jefferson
                  by name. These men, then, were carried away by the fires of genius, they advanced
                  too rapidly; like generals, they rode ahead of the marching legions, who alone
                  could win the battle. There were others, as true friends of liberty, who erred in
                  the opposite extreme. They were sincerely attached to the mother country; they
                  closed their eyes to her faults, as an affectionate child will not see its
                  parent's foibles; they venerated, and justly, the great common law, the bulwark of
                  freedom; they were deeply attached to the liturgy of the established Church; they
                  feared innovation, they feared that the masses, once wholly unfettered, would rush
                  into license and madness. They doubted, and advocated protests and petitions, from
                  a sincere love of country and the species. The names of these patriots were Edmund
                  Pendleton, Richard ard Bland, and others. They were borne onward by Henry and
                  Jefferson, but they, in their turn, held these great leaders back. Thus the
                  phalanx marched slowly, evenly, and in order, with gradual, but certain
                  progression. Had we sounded the battle cry in the year '65, the rising would have
                  been a revolt, now it will be a revolution! The result then would have been
                  defeat, and more grinding slavery; the result now will be victory and freedom! Do
                  you doubt it, friend? Listen to my prediction! As we speak, the House of Burgesses
                  are slowly advancing to a point which will compel them to act strongly or be
                  slaves. They will act as they should, for that body is composed of the flower of
                  this mighty colony, and the eyes of America are fixed anxiously upon them. The
                  whole continent looks to Virginia to sound the war-cry, and she will sound it! She
                  will first draw the sword, and throw the scabbard away. The result of the action
                  of the Burgesses will be this: the Governor will dissolve them; they will dissolve
                  and reassemble in Williamsburg, or in this building, and then the full crisis of
                  the storm will come. The appeal to arms is inevitable, and the die will be cast.
                  The struggle, breast to breast, will commence in Virginia, the great heart of the
                  South, or Massachusetts, that other noble heart of the North. Then see the result!
                  see the fiat of that God who presides over nations, and the doings of his
                  creatures! In this man, Patrick Henry, the revolution speaks—he is its
                     <emph>tongue.</emph> In Jefferson, and the rest, it vindicates itself to the
                  public opinion of Europe—they are its <emph>pen.</emph> In some one not raised up
                  yet, it will find its soul and its <emph>sword.</emph> Do you say, that is the
                  question, that this is the point of doubt? Friend," said the stranger, with
                  glowing eyes, and a gloomy earnestness, which seemed to thrill through his frame,
                  "let us trust in God! let not the atom distrust the Sovereign of the Universe!
                  That great Being has kindled the first fires of revolution; he has raised up,
                  successively, the prophet and the scribe; he has consolidated the phalanx, and he
                  will not leave his work incomplete. Do you question your memory<pb n="158-159"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000080"/> for some name, for some leader who shall lead the
                  onset? There are many, and were it not for fear of presumption, I might hazard an
                  opinion whom this leader will be. He will be led, as a child, by the hand of the
                  Almighty, when the time shall come, and that time is approaching; let us wait!</p>
               <p>"This then," said the stranger, raising his lofty head and gazing out upon the
                  storm which was rolling off to the south, "this then is the point which we have
                  reached. The legions are armed, the ranks are arranged, the leaders await but the
                  trumpet of the enemy to charge! It is this I have toiled for, wearing myself out,
                  and exhausting my life; but I would give to the cause a million lives did I
                  possess them. My name may not be uttered by a single voice, the form which
                  enclosed my spirit may moulder without an epitaph even, but that is of small
                  import. I have done faithfully my duty, I have performed my work, I have gone on
                  my way, and I shall not die until I see the New World inaugurated. See! the
                  thunder-storm is over, and the sky is growing clear—so will it be with us in our
                  struggle! The darkness and the gloom in which we are enveloped will be
                  dissipated—the old things shall pass away, and behold all things shall become new!
                  See the sun yonder; see the glorious and resplendent orb chasing the gloom, rising
                  in serene majesty above the mists and the clouds, and mounting to its meridian of
                  splendor and glory. It is the sun of America! The light of the world! It was
                  hidden by the darkness, but is risen. It is risen! Oh marvelous spectacle! It is
                  risen! Oh noble and consoling thought! It is risen! and the power of a million
                  emperors can never obscure one ray of it, for the hand of the Almighty has rolled
                  it on its glorious way, the hope and the pole star of nations!"</p>
               <p>With eyes fixed almost with ecstacy upon the great orb, the stranger ceased
                  speaking, and seemed almost to forget the presence of his companion. He remained
                  motionless and silent.</p>
               <p>This silence was unbroken by St. John, who, carried away in spite of himself by
                  the words to which he had listened, pondered the thoughts of his companion, and
                  sent his mind, so to speak, through that future which had thus been unrolled
                  before his eyes.</p>
               <p>He was aroused by the voice of the stranger, whose momentary excitement had
                  yielded to his habitual expression of iron calmness.</p>
               <p>"I see that the storm is over," he said, "and now, sir, I must go on my way, for
                  what purpose you know, for I have spoken without reserve. I do not regret having
                  thus uttered my thoughts, and related my sorrowful story. I have accustomed myself
                  to read human character in the countenance, and were you my bitterest enemy I
                  would sleep at your side, though you were awake with a dagger in your hand! I
                  speak my honest conviction alone, friend, and I go without a fear that I have
                  committed an imprudence. I feel that we shall meet again."</p>
               <p>Having thus spoken in a tone of noble courtesy, the stranger bowed to St. John,
                  and issuing forth, mounted his horse, which was tied near, and disappeared on the
                  road to the northward.</p>
               <p>St. John, too, mounted, and overwhelmed with new thought, took his way toward
                  Williamsburg, as the last mutterings of the storm died away in the distance.</p>

               <head type="sub">HOW ST. JOHN MET A FRIEND IN WILLIAMSBURG.</head>
               <p>ONCE more in Williamsburg! It was with new emotions that the young man gazed upon
                  the scene so familiar to him, and he scarcely realized that he could be the same
                  person who had left it, carelessly, so short a time since.</p>
               <p>In that time his mind appeared to have altered its whole<pb n="160-161"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000081"/> character—to have been flooded with emotions and
                  impulses, new, strange and undreamed of.</p>
               <p>He had listened to the voice of a singular and mysterious personage, he had felt
                  his face flush with fire as he heard those blazing accents; a new world had opened
                  to him amid the crash and roar of that storm—a fuller life, in the old church
                  there, among the memorials of dead generations.</p>
               <p>But a world more novel and attractive had expanded itself in another direction
                  before his enamored eye—a world all sunlight, and verdure, and perfume, where the
                  uplands and the fields, lit by suns and moons of surpassing glory, lay sleeping in
                  the dews of a serener heaven. A world which he entered with smiles and sighs to
                  the music of a million singing birds in the foliage, and myriads of streams, that
                  danced over diamonds and pearls. That music and melody resounded in his ears like
                  the dreamy music of the Eolian harp, and a celestial harmony seemed to pervade,
                  like a mysterious undertone, the sound of the singing-birds and the flowing
                  water—the voice of a "simple girl."</p>
               <p>The town, thus, seemed to rise on the young man's sight for the first time, and as
                  he passed along the streets slowly, and with smiles, he looked up at the houses,
                  and wondered that he had never before observed how picturesque they were, relieved
                  against the foliage, and running in long, pretty rows with the white-sanded
                  street.</p>
               <p>Was this the place he had hated so? Could this be the "odious town" he had
                  maligned so? Why it was a fairy village in a lovely land, and the children who
                  tripped along the street with little glancing feet and rippling curls, were the
                  sweetest forms that the eye could possibly behold.</p>
               <p>So true is it that the view we take of life depends on the eyes which we regard it
                  with. Some lips will sneer, and others laugh; to the melancholy, the jaundiced the
                  unhappy, the fairest and most brilliant May day lowers with clouds; to the happy,
                  the buoyant, the rejoiceful vision of the lover, the gloomiest December is a
                  flowery spring.</p>
               <p>The young man's whole nature was changed, and he even thought of Lord Dunmore, as
                  he glanced toward the palace, with indifference and unconcern.</p>
               <p>He went toward the old Raleigh tavern, whose long row of dormer windows sparkled
                  in the May sunlight, and when the smiling ostler took his horse, the young man
                  rewarded his cheerful face with a pistole.</p>
               <p>With head erect, lips smiling, and eyes full of light, Mr. St. John then went
                  toward the front of the building, and here he was quickly accosted by a laughing
                  and hearty voice, which uttered the words:</p>
               <p>"Why <foreign xml:lang="FRA">morbleu!</foreign> my dear fellow, you look like a
                  conqueror. Give you greeting!"</p>
               <p>The speaker was a man of thirty-eight or forty, of all stature, of vigorous frame,
                  and that erect and martial bearing which indicates the profession of arms at some
                  portion of the owner's life. The worthy wore a rich suit of dark cloth, profusely
                  embroidered, a Flanders hat with a black feather bound around it, and a pair of
                  large spurs glittered upon the heels of his horseman's boots, against which a long
                  sword, buckled by an old leather belt, incessantly rattled.</p>
               <p>The face was decidedly a pleasant one, the forehead broad and skirted by short,
                  dark hair; a heavy mustache as black as midnight fringed the firm lips, and the
                  brilliant eyes sparkled and shone with a laughing good humor. The face of the
                  stranger seemed that of a soldier, a <foreign xml:lang="ITA">bon
                     camarado</foreign> of a thousand adventures and vicissitudes, and the heavy
                  mustache which was curled toward the eyes seemed to be eternally agitated by
                  merriment.</p>
               <p>"Good morrow, my dear captain," said St. John, shaking hands, "how are Madame
                  Waters and the little streamlets, and what brings you to Williamsburg?"</p>
               <p>"Basta!" cried the captain, "there 's a flood of questions, and I content myself
                  with replying to the first—that the various inhabitants of Flodden are well and
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">jolies.</foreign> Where have you been?"</p>
               <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6146-00000082"/>
               <p>"Everywhere—another comprehensive answer."</p>
               <p>"Ah! you smile!" cried the captain, curling his huge mustache; "the fact is,
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami,</foreign> your face seems made for smiling,
                  you do it so well."</p>
               <p>"Because I am in good spirits."</p>
               <p>"Is not everybody?"</p>
               <p>"I was not the other day."</p>
               <p>The captain shook his head.</p>
               <p>"That 's unphilosophical," he said, sagely; "keep up the spirits."</p>
               <p>"I can 't always."</p>
               <p>"Why?"</p>
               <p>"They are tried."</p>
               <p>"And this other day?"</p>
               <p>"They were tried by his Excellency, Lord Dunmore."</p>
               <p>"Ah, ah! by his Excellency you say! <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Morbleu!</foreign> he
                  's a bucket of cold water in truth, I understand!"</p>
               <p>"He acted like a shower-bath for me."</p>
               <p>"But you seem to have had the glow of reaction!" said the captain, laughing, "and
                  I do n't wonder at it. As I tell my friend, the Seigneur Mort-Reynard Hamilton,
                  when he growls sometimes, and abuses even my claret, the wretch! as I tell him,
                  there 's nothing like sunshine and May! <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Ventre sainte
                     Gris!</foreign> what a day! 'Tis enough to make a fellow swear from pure excess
                  of spirits!"</p>
               <p>"Swear away then," said St. John, laughing, "and draw on your assortment of French
                  oaths."</p>
               <p>"French! I never swear in French, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami,</foreign> I
                  heartily despise the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Français, morbleu!</foreign> they 're
                  a nation of frog eaters!"</p>
               <p>"You do n't like them?" asked St. John, laughing; "I can understand then that you
                  never utter a single '<foreign xml:lang="FRA">morbleu.</foreign>'"</p>
               <p>"Well, well," said the captain, "perhaps now and then an oath of this description
                  accidentally escapes me, but prepend, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami,</foreign> I
                  detest the Gauls, though they 're brave as steel. You see I fought them for a
                  number of years like an <foreign xml:lang="FRA">insensè</foreign> at Gratz, at
                  Lissa, at Minden and elsewhere, and I assure you they were a devil of a set. I
                  tell you, comrade, if you give a mounseer his champagne and his <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">gloire</foreign>—and add a few <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >chansons</foreign> and the eyes of a young woman—if the Frenchman has these he
                  will cheerfully march into a trench and be shoveled in the same trench with
                  pleasure. At Minden—but here I am running into a story as usual. Basta! a
                  miserable world where a fellow must be ever fighting his battles over again!"</p>
               <p>And the captain closed his lips as though nothing could induce him to
                  continue.</p>
               <p>"There is some apology for my thinking of Minden, comrade," he said, "as the
                  newly-arrived private secretary of his Excellency was there."</p>
               <p>"Who—Captain Foy?"</p>
               <p>"The same."</p>
               <p>"At Minden?"</p>
               <p>"And fought like a Trojan. A keen fellow, that Foy; looks a long way ahead, and 's
                  as sharp as a razor, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">morbleu!</foreign>"</p>
               <p>St. John's eyes were directed down the street.</p>
               <p>"What attracts your attention, comrade?" said the soldier.</p>
               <p>"The individual who 's as sharp as a razor," said St. John, laughing; "I hope he
                  won't cut us."</p>
               <p>"Who? why it 's Foy in person."</p>
               <p>"And coming straight toward us."</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Eh bien!</foreign> we'll give our brother soldier a
                  military salute," said the captain, laughing, and placing his left hand on the
                  hilt of his sword; "let's see if he recognizes his '<foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >compagnon d'armes!</foreign>'"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE SECRET AGENT.</head>
               <p>AS the soldier uttered these words, Captain Foy, private secretary, confidential
                  adviser, and general secret agent of his Excellency, Lord Dunmore, approached the
                  spot where he stood with St. John.</p>
               <p>Captain Foy was a gentleman of middle age, of tall stature, with a pale, cold
                  countenance, piercing eyes beneath shaggy brows, and a certain mixture of boldness
                  and stealthiness in his carriage, which brought to the mind the idea of an animal
                  of the tiger species—at once soft and cruel, calm and ferocious.</p>
               <p>There was about the man an air of mystery and reserve which could not be mistaken,
                  and forcibly impressed upon the beholder the opinion that he was habitually
                  employed in what was then known as "secret service." The secretary was richly
                  clad, but wore no sword, not even a parade weapon, and as he approached, Mr. St.
                  John felt as if a portion of Lord Dunmore himself were walking toward him.</p>
               <p>"Why my dear Foy," said Captain Waters, making a military salute as the secretary
                  came opposite to him, "really delighted to see you! You have n't forgotten an old
                  comrade, eh?"</p>
               <p>The secretary's calm, piercing eye, dwelt for an instant upon the soldier's face,
                  and he replied at once, with a bow,</p>
               <p>"By no means, Captain Waters. I am pleased to meet with you, and with you, Mr. St.
                  John."</p>
               <p>"The same to you my boy," replied the captain, with great good humor; "I reply for
                  both of us. You 're looking rather thin and pale, which is probably owing to your
                  confinement in your abominably disagreeable office of secretary, and I find you no
                  longer the jolly companion you were on the continent; but I 'm delighted to see
                  you."</p>
               <p>"I reciprocate your obliging sentiments, Captain," said Foy, in the same serene
                  tone.</p>
               <p>"You really, then, have not forgotten me?"</p>
               <p>"By no means! I think that is proved by saluting you at once, though I had no
                  expectation of seeing you."</p>
               <p>"Why certainly," cried the captain. "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Morbleu!</foreign>
                  that never occurred to me. The fact is, my dear comrade, I am deteriorating, I 'm
                  getting fat and stupid for want of fighting. <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >Tonnerre!</foreign> if I only had Minden for an hour! I 'd get well again, or
                  the devil's in it!"</p>
               <p>"A terrible fight, Captain Waters."</p>
               <p>"Perfectly glorious!"</p>
               <p>"We were near each other frequently, I remember."</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Morbleu!</foreign> that 's a great compliment!" cried the
                  soldier.</p>
               <p>"A compliment, sir?"</p>
               <p>"To myself, faith!"</p>
               <p>The secretary bowed serenely.</p>
               <p>"No simpers and disclaimers, comrade!" said the soldier; "may the devil eat me
                  whole, if you did n't fight like a wild boar. At present, companion, permit me to
                  say that your countenance resembles that of a clergyman; on the day of Minden, it
                  resembled that of Mars, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">parbleu!</foreign> A devil of a
                  fight, friend! and you did your part like a firebrand!"</p>
               <p>As the captain spoke thus in his rough, laughing voice, a slight color seemed to
                  tinge, for a moment, the pale cheek of the soldier-secretary, and his eyes
                  wandered. He recovered instantly, however, his presence of mind, and with a
                  movement of his hand, said,</p>
               <p>"I fear you are too complimentary, sir; I did but my small part!"</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Morbleu!</foreign> 't was a large part, companion. I'll
                  say that everywhere, and do you full justice, if you <emph>are</emph> the
                  secretary of my Lord Dunmore, whom I've not yet fallen very much in love with. In
                  fact, I dislike that worthy nobleman to an extent really wonderful, but I do n't
                  commit injustice. I have the pleasure of informing you, my dear St. John, that<pb
                     n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6146-00000084"/> Captain, or Secretary Foy, went through
                  the ranks of the French at Minden like a flaming sword, and that he was publicly
                  complimented by his commanding officer, on full parade, afterwards."</p>
               <p>Foy made a modest movement with his hand.</p>
               <p>"You forget after Lissa, Captain Waters," he said, "and for fear you will not
                  mention it, I will inform Mr. St. John that <emph>you</emph> were publicly thanked
                  also, sir."</p>
               <p>"Why so I was!" cried the captain. "I 'd forgotten it!"</p>
               <p>"I have not, sir, as I shall not forget the flash of your sword in the
                  charge."</p>
               <p>"See now!" said the captain, laughing, "how pleasant this is."</p>
               <p>"Pleasant?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, recalling, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">morbleu!</foreign> all these tender
                  recollections! There is one, however, my dear Foy, which affects me even still
                  more deeply."</p>
               <p>"What 's that, captain?"</p>
               <p>"The little scene at Reinfels!"</p>
               <p>And the captain burst into laughter.</p>
               <p>The ghost of a smile touched the secretary's pale face.</p>
               <p>"Basta!" cried the captain. "I see you remember!"</p>
               <p>"Perfectly, sir," replied the secretary, serenely.</p>
               <p>"Under the bastion!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"A little duel, my dear friend," said the captain to St. John, by way of
                  explanation; "a little bout between Foy and myself. I regret to say that our
                  present dear spiritual adviser, as I regard him, and myself, fell out about
                  a—"</p>
               <p>"Ah, Captain Waters! why recall these follies?"</p>
               <p>"Why not? They were but youthful pranks."</p>
               <p>"That is all, sir."</p>
               <p>"Well, as I was saying, 't was a girl that we quarreled for. We fought the next
                  morning, and faith! both of us were a month in the hospital!"</p>
               <p>"Unfortunately," said the secretary, "that is true—just a month!"</p>
               <p>"And you remember, my dear comrade—?"</p>
               <p>"What, Captain Waters?"</p>
               <p>"We were lying in cots, next to each other."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I remember."</p>
               <p>"And I made you explain, with the arm I had slashed, the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >coup</foreign> which broke my guard, and ran me very nearly through the
                  gizzard. <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Morbleu!</foreign> 't was admirable, and I adored
                  you after that blow!"</p>
               <p>With which the captain laughed.</p>
               <p>"See how pleasant 't is, recalling these scenes of the past," he said. "<foreign
                     xml:lang="DEU">Hilf himmel!</foreign> is there any thing like it? Here I 'm
                  getting fat and vegetating, and becoming a country squire, thinking only of
                  tobacco and wheat, and with not a care in the world, when, formerly, in the good
                  old times, I was lean and full of muscle, with a wrist of bone and sinew, not a
                  sous in my pocket, and half the time not knowing where to lay my head! Bah! it 's
                  really deplorable—is it not comrade?"</p>
               <p>"I think it more agreeable, sir."</p>
               <p>"More agreeable! You do n't really? But I can 't wonder at your mistake—you 've
                  not tried it."</p>
               <p>"I am, like yourself, no longer a soldier."</p>
               <p>"Why so you are not."</p>
               <p>"I am a civilian."</p>
               <p>"And a secretary. My dear comrade," said the captain, sighing, "we have both
                  deteriorated. I foresee that we shall have no more amusement, no life, no frolics!
                  For the future we must resign ourselves to fate. No more Mindens, no Lissas, no
                  glorious assaults like that of Breslau, where I think the devil got loose; no
                  battles or skirmishes any more! In the bitterness of my regret, comrade, I could
                  propose a bout here in the street, that I might thus be taken back to old times
                  and learn the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coup</foreign> of Reinfels! I despair of any
                  amusement in the future, comrade, unless—but that is idle."</p>
               <p>"Unless, captain?"</p>
               <p>"Unless Dunmore will afford it."</p>
               <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6146-00000085"/>
               <p>The secretary retired into himself suddenly, all thoughts of the past seemed to
                  disappear, and his pale face became impenetrable.</p>
               <p>"That reminds me, Captain Waters," he said, with formal courtesy, "that my duties
                  recall me to his lordship's presence—I have already tarried too long. I have the
                  honor to salute you, gentlemen."</p>
               <p>And the secretary bowed, and then moved toward the palace.</p>
               <p>"I say, my dear Foy!" called the captain.</p>
               <p>"Sir," said the secretary, half turning.</p>
               <p>"Give my compliments to his Excellency, and tell him I am thirsting for something
                  to do. If he'll only endeavor now to turn the Burgesses out of doors and give me
                  an opportunity of meeing you, sword in hand, and learning the <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">coup</foreign>—of Reinfels, you know!"</p>
               <p>A strange smile flitted over the subtle face of the secretary, but he only
                  bowed.</p>
               <p>In a moment he disappeared at the corner of the street which led to the
                  palace.</p>
               <p>Captain Ralph Waters looked after him for a moment in silence, and then moving his
                  head up and down, said to St. John,</p>
               <p>"My dear companion, there goes one of the most dangerous fellows under heaven! As
                  close as a trap, as brave as steel, and as cunning as the devil. Take care of
                  him!"</p>
               <p>"Thanks for your warning," said St. John, laughing, "but I 'm not afraid."</p>
               <p>"Well, I do n't feel so myself. In case of trying the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >coup</foreign> of Reinfels, I count on you."</p>
               <p>"The <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coup?</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"In a duel with Foy, I mean."</p>
               <p>"Certainly; and if ever I 'm in want of a second, you'll act for me?"</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Morbleu!</foreign> with delight, my dear comrade!"</p>
               <p>"It 's a bargain?"</p>
               <p>"Signed and sealed."</p>
               <p>"Well, perhaps I may call on you."</p>
               <p>And the friends parted, going each a different way.</p>

               <head type="sub">HOW A VIRGINIA GIRL WROTE VERSES IN '74.</head>
               <p>ST. JOHN was going along in a reverie, with his head hanging down, his hands idle
                  at his side, his steps wandering and uncertain, as the steps of drunkards and
                  lovers, those true brethren, are so apt to be, when suddenly he found himself
                  arrested; a gross material obstacle encountered him, his hat was thrust forcibly
                  quite over his eyes, and he waked up, so to speak, from his dream.</p>
               <p>The first object which attracted his attention was a slight gentleman, clad in a
                  suit of dark drab cloth, and carrying under his arm a bundle of papers, which
                  gentleman, with a profusion of smiles and numerous deprecating waves of the hand,
                  uttered a flood of apologies, accompanied by courteous bows.</p>
               <p>"I beg you'll not trouble yourself about such a trifle, Mr. Purdie," said St.
                  John, shaking hands with the editor of the old "Virginia Gazette," "'t was the
                  most natural thing in the world."</p>
               <p>"Very awkward in me! really now, excessively awkward, Mr. St. John!"</p>
               <p>"'T was my own fault."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me," returned Mr. Purdie, with courteous persistence, "I was really to
                  blame! But this copy of verses absorbed me."</p>
               <p>"Very well, my dear friend, have it as you will; but pray let me have a sight of
                  the copy of verses which interested you so."</p>
               <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6146-00000086"/>
               <p>"Willingly, my dear sir."</p>
               <p>And Mr. Purdie handed a letter to Mr. St. John. As his eyes fell upon the
                  hand-writing, a slight color came to the young man's cheek, and he smiled. Mr.
                  Purdie wondered at the sparkling eyes and deep interest betrayed by the young man
                  as he read the verses; but we shall soon understand the reason.</p>
               <p>The letter and poem were word for word as follows. We have even retained the
                  spelling and capital letters customary at the period in written composition.</p>

               <p>These were the lines which caused Mr. St. John's eyes to sparkle and his face to
                  beam with smiles. The explanation of this is not difficult. As the reader has
                  guessed, they were in the handwriting of Miss Bonnybel Vane.</p>
               <p>"Well, sir," said Mr. Purdie, smiling, when the young man had finished, "you seem
                  as much pleased as myself."</p>
               <p>"I am delighted, my dear Mr. Purdie," was the laughing reply, "indeed I admire
                  them so greatly that I shall esteem as a great favor the gift of the manuscript,
                  promising you a clear copy in an hour."</p>
               <p>"I see not the least objection, my dear Mr. St. John—pray keep them—a friend eh?"
                  he added with a sly smile; "and now I wish you a very good morning."</p>
               <p>The friends parted, and Mr. St. John hastened to his lodgings to make the copy he
                  had promised. The occupation<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6146-00000087"/> was often
                  interrupted by laughter, but the copy was finished at last and sent to the office
                  of the "Virginia Gazette."</p>
               <p>On the fourth page of the old journal for June 2, 1774, the reader will find them
                  now, though unaccompanied by the letter, good Mr. Purdie having given his space to
                  more important events than the epistles of young ladies. Here, in the discolored
                  pages of the old colonial paper, were the verses found by the present writer. You
                  read such old pieces with smiles and sighs if you are a dreamer. Where now are the
                  lips which kissed, the eyes that shone—all the "charms" which true lovers
                  "confessed"—the archness, the favor, the disdain? From far-off fields—the fields
                  of colonial Virginia—shines the form of this lovely little maiden, so long dead.
                  She passed away like a shadow or a dream—like the brilliant old days she adorned
                  with her loveliness—her bright eyes and curls, her blushes and smiles. But being
                  dead she still lives and speaks; lives here on the yellow old page, as up there on
                  the canvas! The "giddy girl" was a heroine at heart; that heart, like ten thousand
                  more of her sex's, beat high and true in the storm of the Revolution!</p>

               <head type="sub">HOW MR. ST. JOHN RETURNED HIS COMMISSION TO LORD DUNMORE.</head>
               <p>THE young man had just returned to his lodgings, and had scarcely seated himself,
                  when a knock came at his door, and a servant, wearing the livery of Lord Dunmore,
                  entered, and bowing respectfully, handed him a note.</p>
               <p>"Good," said he to himself, "now I think the storm comes; I am summoned to be
                  scolded, or arrested."</p>
               <p>And he calmly read the note, bidding the servant return. The communication was in
                  these words:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Secretary Foy presents his respects to Mr. St. John, and requests, on the
                  part of his Excellency Lord Dunmore, that Mr. St. John will attend at the palace
                  this afternoon, for conversation with his lordship on military affairs."</p>
               <p>"Very well," said the young man, tossing the paper carelessly on the table, "I
                  suppose there'll be an explosion. I care nothing."</p>
               <p>Early in the afternoon he made his toilette, proceeded to the palace, and was
                  ushered into the council chamber.</p>
               <p>Lord Dunmore, clad with his habitual splendor, sat opposite the portraits of the
                  king and queen, the members of his council occupying large leather chairs ranged
                  in a circle. Behind the table, draped with red damask, and covered with papers,
                  the pale face of Captain Foy was seen, as he bent over the documents lying before
                  him.</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John was ushered in with great form, and having attracted the Governor's
                  attention, made that dignitary a bow, which was perfectly courteous and stiff.</p>
               <p>His eye then made the circuit of the apartment—dwelt on the members of the
                  council, the secretary, the Governor in the center.</p>
               <p>It looked very much like a trial for high treason, a proceeding of the Star
                  Chamber.</p>
               <p>Lord Dunmore, upon whose brow was visible its customary expression of hauteur and
                  ill humor, acknowledged the young man's salute by the least possible movement of
                  his head.</p>
               <p>The members of the council were, however, better bred, and inclined their heads
                  courteously, as the new comer saluted them.</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. St. John," said Lord Dunmore, moving with dignity in his large
                  throne-like chair, "I see you received my message."</p>
               <p>"I did receive a note from Captain Foy, your Excellency."</p>
               <p>"I instructed him to write, as you doubtless saw."</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John inclined, calmly.</p>
               <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6146-00000088"/>
               <p>His Excellency did not seem pleased at the small effect produced upon his visitor
                  by the solemnity and state of his reception. His brow clouded with its unpleasant
                  frown, and his head rose more haughtily than ever.</p>
               <p>"I wished to see you, sir," he said, almost rudely, "to express my disapprobation
                  of your lengthened absence from command of my guards. You must be aware, sir, that
                  such absence does not comport with my views of the duty of the commander of that
                  body, but I am ready to listen to any thing in explanation from yourself,
                  sir."</p>
               <p>As the Governor spoke, the old flush of anger came to Mr. St. John's face, and his
                  head rose proudly erect as he listened to these words, even more insulting in tone
                  than significance. The folly of any exhibition of ill temper seemed, however, to
                  strike him at once, and he controlled himself in an instant.</p>
               <p>"Do not be embarrassed, sir," said the Governor. "I have no desire to confuse
                  you."</p>
               <p>"I am much obliged to your Excellency," said the young man, calmly, "but I do n't
                  feel at all confused or embarrassed."</p>
               <p>"I thought, being a young man, sir—"</p>
               <p>"That I was a clodhopper? No, your Excellency, that is not my station in society,"
                  replied Mr. St. John, with calm politeness.</p>
               <p>The vein on Lord Dunmore's brow swelled, and his little eyes began to gleam with
                  anger. He plainly resented the tone of unconcern in the delinquent, and was
                  carried out of his equanimity.</p>
               <p>"You amuse yourself at my expense, sir," he said, coldly, "and intimate that I
                  intended as an insult what was not so meant. My observation arose from the way in
                  which you carry your hat, sir—what I should call an <emph>uneasy</emph> way!"</p>
               <p>And the Governor frowned.</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John was motionless and silent for a moment, in presence of the man who
                  was guilty of this immense exhibition of ill breeding.</p>
               <p>He surveyed Lord Dunmore with an expression of frigid surprise, which caused the
                  vein in that gentleman's forehead to distend itself hugely.</p>
               <p>"My hat, your Excellency?" said the young man, with freezing politeness, "perhaps
                  the uneasiness your Excellency is so good as to observe, is caused by the fact
                  that I have no place to deposit it, your Excellency not having requested me to be
                  seated."</p>
               <p>And with the air of a nobleman who has been outraged, Mr. St. John made his
                  lordship a low and exaggerated bow.</p>
               <p>His lordship was beaten with his own weapons, his rudeness failed, and his ill
                  temper laughed at in the presence of his council, the most loyal of whom could not
                  forbear smiling.</p>
               <p>His countenance colored with anger, and his eyes flashed.</p>
               <p>"Well, sir!" he said, "you gentlemen of Virginia are extremely witty! I make you
                  my compliments, sir, upon your attainments in private theatricals! Your
                  discourteous reply to my simple remark, however, sir, shall not move me. If I
                  overlooked the fact that you were standing, it was because I am not accustomed to
                  request persons who are called to defend themselves before me, to be seated in my
                  presence."</p>
               <p>The young man met this outburst with an expression of cold disdain lurking in his
                  eyes, which lashed the Governor's anger into fury.</p>
               <p>"I await your reply, sir!" he said, almost trembling with rage.</p>
               <p>"If your lordship will frame a distinct question, I will reply," said Mr. St.
                  John. "I can not answer your denunciation."</p>
               <p>"I demand why you have absented yourself from the barracks of my guards?"</p>
               <p>"I went to visit my relations."</p>
               <p>"That is no excuse, sir."</p>
               <p>"I inform your lordship that I left my sub-lieutenant in command," said the young
                  man, coldly, controlling himself.</p>
               <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6146-00000089"/>
               <p>"That was wholly informal, without my permission, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Informal, my lord?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir! worse! It was a dereliction of duty!"</p>
               <p>"Your lordship proceeds far, and I am at a loss to understand upon what grounds
                  this decision is based."</p>
               <p>"I am not in the habit, sir, of defending my opinions on occasions like this!"</p>
               <p>"This is, then, simply your Excellency's opinion?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir—it is the opinion of every rational individual. You have deserted your
                  post and gone away at your pleasure, sir, leaving your command to take care of
                  itself!"</p>
               <p>"I have the honor to call to your Excellency's attention the fact that Virginia is
                  not now in a state of war."</p>
               <p>"That is nothing, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, my lord, I think 't is a vast deal. During hostilities I should not
                  have gone away."</p>
               <p>"There 's no difference, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Your Excellency is determined to find fault with me."</p>
               <p>"I repeat that you have deserted your post, sir! I repeat that!"</p>
               <p>"I have the honor to repeat that my sub lieutenant is in command."</p>
               <p>"You know perfectly, sir, that he 's no fit commander for my guards!"</p>
               <p>"He 's an Englishman, commissioned by your Excellency."</p>
               <p>"Mr. St. John!" said the Governor, crimson with rage, "are you aware with whom you
                  are bandying epithets and contradictions?"</p>
               <p>"Your Excellency has spoken, I have replied," returned the young man, bracing
                  himself against the coming storm.</p>
               <p>"Are you aware, sir, that I am a peer of the realm?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>
               <p>"That I am the Governor of this colony—do you know that, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>
               <p>"And knowing this, sir—knowing my nobility, and my power—knowing my commission
                  from his Majesty—a commission, sir, which gives me the power of punishing sedition
                  and treason!—knowing this, sir, you have presumed to address me as you have done!
                  Pray, who are you, sir?" added his Excellency, almost trembling with rage and
                  scorn, "who are you, to reply to me in this manner?"</p>
               <p>The young man made a ceremonious bow, and in a tone as cold as ice, replied,</p>
               <p>"Only a gentleman, your lordship—that, and nothing more."</p>
               <p>These calm words put the finishing touch to Lord Dunmore's wrath. Beaten,
                  defeated, derided, humbled almost, by a young man who did not lose his temper,
                  while he was furious; exposed and humiliated thus in presence of his council and
                  his secretary, the Governor shook with speechless rage, and almost rose to his
                  feet in the tumult of his wrath.</p>
               <p>"Look you, sir!" he cried with an explosion of passion, "this interview has come
                  to a conclusion! There is but one reply I have to make to your insults, sir!"</p>
               <p>His lordship turned furiously to Captain Foy, and would have ended his threatening
                  sentence by an order to that gentleman.</p>
               <p>Something in Captain Foy's eye, however, seemed to arrest him even in the height
                  of his rage. The dark glance of the secretary and the slight movement of his pale
                  lips, seemed to produce an instant effect upon Lord Dunmore, and he did not finish
                  the sentence which doubtless would have ordered the arrest of Mr. St. John.</p>
               <p>The subtle glance of Captain Foy seemed to arouse in the Governor his own large
                  supply of cunning, and he leaned back silent for a moment in his seat, scowling at
                  the young man.</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John preserved the same attitude of coldness and disdain, and waited to be
                  addressed.</p>
               <p>"Young man," said his Excellency, with a bad affectation of dignified forbearance,
                  "you have in this conversation<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6146-00000090"/> adopted
                  a manner of speaking toward myself extremely irritating and wholly improper,
                  coming from one of your age to myself. Permit me, also, to say, sir, that more
                  than you imagine is due to a peer of the realm and the representative of his
                  majesty in the colony, and it will be well for the inhabitants of this colony to
                  understand the fact. Yes, sir!" continued his Excellency, carried out of his
                  assumed dignity, "the sooner they become convinced of the fact, the better for
                  them! and I think that you, sir, have much yet to learn."</p>
               <p>"I desire to treat your Excellency with every particle of respect that is your
                  due," replied Mr. St. John coldly.</p>
               <p>"Those words may contain a new insult, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Your Excellency's number of imaginary insults drives me to despair."</p>
               <p>"That's a very pretty speech, sir! Then I search for insults!"</p>
               <p>"I did not say so, my lord."</p>
               <p>"But you looked it!" said Dunmore, gradually yielding again to his anger; "it is
                  your favorite mode of outraging me, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Your Excellency seems determined to be outraged. I have the misfortune to be
                  tried and convicted before my hearing, in the mind of your lordship."</p>
               <p>"No, sir! this is not the first time you have placed yourself upon my level, even
                  arrogated superiority, I think, to judge from your lordly manner!"</p>
               <p>And the Governor's lip curled with a sneer.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir!" said the Governor, the vein in his forehead again swelling, "on the
                  day of Lady Dunmore's entry I was subjected to your highness' imposing air, and
                  was informed that I was afraid of a child. Your highness," he continued, with a
                  disdainful sneer, "was so good as to find fault with my honest expression of
                  opinion about the traitor, Waters, and reprove me with your eyes! By Heaven, sir!"
                  cried Lord Dunmore, starting up and relapsing into greater rage than before, "by
                  Heaven, sir! I have endured sufficient insult, and my patience is ended. Mr.
                  Lieutenant St. John—"</p>
               <p>"Stop, sir!—my lord, I should say—a moment!" interrupted the young man, rising to
                  a loftier and colder attitude, "I am no longer Lieutenant St. John—I no longer
                  hold a commission in the service of your Excellency, or the colony; I resign that
                  commission, and return it to your Excellency, and scorn it!"</p>
               <p>As the young man spoke, his face turned white with rage and disdain, and taking
                  from his bosom the parchment, he threw it at the Governor's feet.</p>
               <p>"'T is the post of a slave!" he said, "and I'll be no man's lackey! Your
                  Excellency may supply yourself with another menial! I'll not fill the position of
                  head waiter to any peer of the realm that ever was born! I 'm a Virginian, and I
                  'm free! and I'll not be your slave to shiver at your frown, and crouch like a
                  hound at your bidding! I've been outraged and insulted; your lordship has tried to
                  put your foot on my neck, and I resist, that is all! I resist! and I add that I'll
                  go to my death before mortal man makes a serf of me! I have done, sir! You hear
                  what has boiled in my breast from the first day I entered your service—from the
                  hour when, misled by your unworthy representations, I put on your livery! You hear
                  a Virginian's voice—one who 's subjected to such insults as he'll no longer
                  endure! I throw back your lordship's commission, and scorn it, and stamp on it!
                  I'll not be your slave, and I 'm free again!"</p>
               <p>And trembling with passion, his eyes burning in his pale face like balls of fire,
                  the young man turned toward the door.</p>
               <p>Dunmore rose up as on springs. The members of the council had risen tumultuously
                  to their feet too, and the eyes of Captain Foy glittered in his white countenance
                  as he towered above the group.</p>
               <p>"Captain Foy!" said Lord Dunmore, pallid with rage, "call the sentinel to arrest
                  this man."</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John's sword—a part of his full dress—flashed instantly<pb n="180-181"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000091"/> stantly from its scabbard, and he struck his hat
                  down upon his brows furiously.</p>
               <p>"I'll not be arrested!" he said; "I swore that I would first plunge this sword
                  into your lordship's breast! and I'll do it!"</p>
               <p>As the weapon flashed before his eyes, and these furious words resounded through
                  the room, Lord Dunmore trembled and drew back.</p>
               <p>His lordship was not courageous.</p>
               <p>"I'll not be arrested!" added the young man, white with wrath; "I'll not be sent
                  to rot in a prison, or tried for sedition on your lordship's evidence. You have
                  made me desperate, and I'll go all lengths to defend myself!"</p>
               <p>With which words Mr. St. John left the room and the palace, unpursued and
                  unmolested.</p>
               <p>We shall only add that the council broke up in confusion, and that Lord Dunmore
                  and Captain Foy remained alone.</p>
               <p>Dunmore strode about the room crimson with rage, and uttering violent curses, with
                  which he seemed to endeavor to unburden himself of his wrath.</p>
               <p>Captain Foy was writing, serenely, calm, pale and quiet.</p>
               <p>"The instructions for Conolly are ready, my lord," he said; "let us forget this
                  little scene, and come to business."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXI.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE LETTER.</head>
               <p>ST. JOHN proceeded to his lodgings, frowning, gesticulating and muttering
                  wrathfully, to the great astonishment of the passers by. Reaching his chambers, he
                  sat down, began to smoke a pipe, and grew more composed.</p>
               <p>"The fact is I gave him as good as he sent," the young man at length muttered,
                  with a grim smile, "insulted him to the teeth, and humiliated him in presence of
                  his council—that 's some satisfaction in any event. I suppose I 'm on the Black
                  List ere now, and the order for my arrest is issued. Let 'em attempt it! I'll not
                  be taken alive, and it 's odds if I do n't raise such a storm in the streets of
                  the good town of Williamsburg, as will break some windows in his Excellency's
                  palace!"</p>
               <p>Having thus relieved his feelings, St. John was about to fall into a reverie when
                  his servant entered bearing the tall silver candlesticks. Taking from the table a
                  letter which the young man had not seen, he placed it on a waiter and handed it to
                  his master, with the explanation that Dick, from Vanely, had brought it in his
                  absence.</p>
               <p>St. John took the letter, motioned the servant away, and glanced at the
                  superscription. He had no sooner done so than his frowning brow cleared; his
                  compressed lips expanded with a smile. The letter was sealed with blue wax,
                  stamped with the Vane coat of arms—an armed hand grasping a sword, and beneath, a
                  shield with three mail gaunlets, supported by a stag and sphynx—the motto,
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Nec temere, nec timide.</foreign>

               <p>But St. John did not look at the seal—the direction was in a handwriting which he
                  knew perfectly—and carefully opening the letter, with a smile, and the murmured
                  words, "'Neither rashly, nor fearfully!'—an admirable motto for a lover!" read

                           <p>"Having executed my commission I might terminate my letter here, but I
                              shall take pity on your lordship's forlorn condition, so far away from
                              home, and add a few lines. The day you went—that is yesterday—Barry
                              Hunter came, and said that his lands in the southwest of the colony
                              had grown immensely in value, and that any young lady <emph>who
                                 accepted him,</emph> might be a princess if she chose, and have a
                              kingdom. A princess, forsooth! A princess of the woods, I fancy, with
                              bears and panthers for subjects! Nevertheless Barry's extremely
                              handsome, and I am seriously thinking of marrying the young gentleman,
                              if he asks me, which he shall! Just mark my words, sir.</p>
                           <p>"Before I end I 've a favor to request of your Excellency. 'T is to
                              write a line to that tyrannical Mr. William Effingham of the 'The
                              Cove,' in Glo'ster, commanding him, on pain of my displeasure, to
                              bring <emph>Kate</emph> to the assembly. She 's the queen of goodness,
                              and the star of loveliness—at which declaration I suppose your
                              lordship laughs, and says 'pooh! pooh! a woman chanting the praises of
                              another!' That would be quite in keeping with your ordinary turn for
                              satire and injustice. But say what you choose, only write. If she does
                              not come I'll say with <emph>Robin Adair,</emph> 'What 's the dull
                              town to me—Kate is not there!' And you know the other words, 'What
                              makes the assembly shine?' to which I reply, Kate! Mr. Champ Effingham
                              and Madam Clare will be present, and 't will be a
                                 <emph>delightful</emph> family reunion!</p>
                           <p>"Will not your Excellency come to Vanely, and bestow upon us the
                              brilliancy of his countenance before the assembly? I pine without him;
                              my days are spent in sighing and looking down the road; I've quite
                              lost my appetite, and Mr. Thomas Alston, who was here this morning,
                              could not make me laugh! <emph>When you come to-morrow,</emph> be sure
                              to make a noise in opening the great gate, that I may put on my best
                              gown and ruffles to receive your Excellency as becomes his
                              importance.</p>
                           <p>"Goodness gracious! what a flood of foolish nonsense! as if so great a
                              military gentleman could think of his poor little country cousin. Has
                              the explosion taken place at the palace? I hope not. Of course I do
                              n't expect you <emph>about half past eleven to-morrow morning.</emph>

               <p>The young man dropped the hand which held the letter, and smiled.</p>
               <p>"The young lady in Glo'ster!" he murmured; "so my friendship for that damsel has
                  subjected us to the curious eyes, and the gossip of the tattling world! I 'd
                  certainly show my taste; but pretty Miss Puss has a terrible rival! Her
                  countenance is lovely, 't is very true, with its beautiful eyes and bewitching
                  lips; but I look beyond to a face I 've loved from boyhood!"</p>
               <p>And he reread the letter, thinking that her hand had lain upon the paper. Poor St.
                  John! Then carefully depositing the paper in the breast pocket of his doublet, he
                  went and leaned from the open window, and surveyed the moonlit streets of the
                  town, upon which the shades of night were descending.</p>
               <p>An irresistible desire took possession of him to wander out in the balmy night,
                  and putting on his hat, he issued forth into the nearly deserted streets.</p>
               <p>Buried in thought, he went on, unconsciously, for some time. Suddenly he saw a
                  grove of trees before him, and looking around, discovered that he had made his
                  way, without knowing it, as far as the picturesque "Indian Camp."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXII.</head>
               <head type="sub">WHAT HAPPENED AT THE "INDIAN CAMP."</head>
               <p>THE "Indian Camp" was a wild and secluded retreat, the haunt, in former times, so
                  said tradition, of the great King Powhatan and his dusky followers. In course of
                  time it had, however, become the resort of those fond of natural
                  beauties—especially the chosen meeting-place of lovers. Many allusions to it may
                  be found in letters of the period.</p>
               <p>It now lay before the eyes of the young man, clothed in all its wild and
                  mysterious beauty. Seating himself upon a mound of moss-covered rock, he gazed
                  pensively upon the scene, surrendering his thoughts wholly to the woman whom he
                  loved. For an hour he was scarcely aware of the objects around him. The weird
                  moonlight fell from the heights of heaven unheeded. The dazzling orb rode like a
                  ship of pearl through the drifting clouds; the melancholy whippoorwill sent his
                  mournful cry from the wood; the owl whooped from the low grounds; the river breeze
                  came and fanned the dreamer's cheek—he was still absorbed in thought.</p>
               <p>"Yes," murmured the young man, "I'll go and essay my fate; 'to-morrow, at half
                  past eleven,' shall find me at Vanely, and I'll put it on the hazard of the die.
                  Is there hazard? Did I misinterpret her demeanor on that evening at the trysting
                  tree? Courage! <foreign xml:lang="LAT">nec timide, nec temere!</foreign>"</p>
               <p>And the murmur died into silence. Another hour passed by, the young man pondered
                  still, gazing at the old shadowy mounds and trenches as they gleamed in the
                  moonlight.</p>
               <p>Suddenly the light was obscured, and raising his eyes, he saw that a huge cloud,
                  moving slowly like a great black hulk, had invaded the moon, and buried it in its
                  ebon folds.</p>
               <p>In the darkness the rude objects of the scene loomed out more shadowy and solemn
                  still, and the cry of the whippoorwill assumed a deeper sadness. St. John rose and
                  leaned against the trunk of an oak, whose wide boughs cast an impenetrable shade,
                  and thus elevated, as it were, above the scene, listened to the subdued and
                  mysterious sounds of night.</p>
               <p>All at once to these stealthy noises was added another sound; he thought at first
                  that his fancy deceived him, but this impression soon disappeared. He heard
                  cautious voices whispering.</p>
               <p>He bent forward, inclining his ear in the direction of the sound. He was not
                  mistaken in his surmise. As he gazed and listened, holding his breath almost, two
                  dark figures detached themselves, as it were, from the darkness, and advanced
                  toward the spot which he occupied.</p>
               <p>With an unconscious movement he drew deeper into the shadow of the heavy boughs,
                  and, blended with the shade which they cast, was lost completely to view.</p>
               <p>The figures passed so close to him that their garments almost touched his own,
                  still whispering in a low and stealthy tone. They had gone but a few paces when
                  the obscuring cloud passed from the moon, and St. John discerned them clearly. The
                  first figure was very tall, the other shorter, and wrapped from head to foot in a
                  long cloak, upon whose collar drooped the folds of what seemed a Spanish hat,
                  completely concealing the face.</p>
               <p>The taller of the two wore no wrapping, and Mr. St. John distinctly recognized the
                  form of Lindon. He bent earnestly toward his companion, and seemed to be urging
                  something which had been met with opposition. Mr. St. John could not catch the
                  words, which were uttered in a low and cautious, though very excited tone, and he
                  was glad that they did not reach him; glad when the voice grew more and more a
                  mere murmur, and Lindon, with his silent companion, disappeared in the distance
                  and the darkness. Their footfalls, growing fainter and fainter, were finally
                  absorbed by the silence.</p>
               <p>St. John stood for an instant looking in the direction they had taken, and then,
                  issuing forth from the shadow, calmly bent his way back to Williamsburg.</p>
               <pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6146-00000094"/>
               <p>"That is really something more than I bargained for," he muttered as he went
                  along. "I came to enjoy my own thoughts in silence, and alone, and here I stumble
                  on this man and one of his companions. They say that Lindon and his Excellency
                  have exchanged many civilities, and my head to half a crown! that man is engaged
                  in the plots against the liberties of Virginia!"</p>
               <p>"Well," continued the young man, after a pause, during which he looked
                  thoughtfully toward the lights of the town, which were, one by one, disappearing,
                  like fire-flies going to sleep, "well, let this gentleman of the villainous
                  countenance go on his way. He is nothing to me, and I do n't fear that he will do
                  us any injury. He plots and walks in darkness as his congenial element, but there
                  are others who conspire against the conspirator!"</p>
               <p>With these words St. John returned to his chamber, and after a last look at the
                  moon, fell asleep murmuring the motto of Bonnybel's seal, "<foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >Nec temere, nec timide!</foreign>"</p>
               <p>He had a strange dream. He fancied himself again at the Indian Camp, with the
                  mysterious figures of Lindon and his companion before him. They disappeared, but
                  suddenly came upon him again, before he was aware, behind his back. He saw
                  Lindon's face convulsed with a smile of triumphant hate, as he placed a dagger in
                  the hand of his companion, with which the cloaked figure struck at the young man's
                  back. He started from sleep, and half sprung from bed, but laughing at his fears,
                  soon fell asleep again, his slumber remaining uninterrupted until morning.</p>
               <p>Do dreams ever forewarn? Had Mr. St. John believed so, and acted upon his
                  convictions, the whole current of this narrative would have been changed.</p>
               <p>At seven o'clock upon the following morning, he was pursuing, at full speed, the
                  road to Vanely.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">A SLEEPING BEAUTY.</head>
               <p>THE young man rode so well that before the hour indicated in Bonnybel's letter, he
                  entered the great gate of Vanely, and cantered to the door.</p>
               <p>No servant was visible, and securing his horse to the rack beneath one of the
                  great oaks, he entered the mansion.</p>
               <p>He opened the door of the library expecting to see Colonel Vane; his hand was
                  extended to greet the old gentleman, but suddenly he paused.</p>
               <p>In the great leather chair by the table, covered with books and papers, Miss
                  Bonnybel, overcome, apparently, by the balmy influence of the May morning, was
                  slumbering tranquilly. Upon her lap rested an open volume, which seemed to have
                  escaped from her hand as she fell asleep, for one of the slender fingers remained
                  between the leaves.</p>
               <p>St. John paused for a moment to take in fully the entire details of the pretty
                  picture.</p>
               <p>The great chair had a sloping back, and thus the young lady's position was almost
                  that of one reclining. The graceful head was languidly thrown back, and drooped
                  side-wise towards the rounded shoulder. Her hair had become unbound and lay in
                  brown masses of curls upon her neck. Her small feet, with high-heeled slippers,
                  decorated with rich rosettes, reposed upon a velvet-cushioned cricket, and the
                  little pointed toes, over which fell the ribbons of the artificial roses, peeped
                  out gracefully from their hiding place.</p>
               <p>The young man remained for some time silent and motionless, watching the sleeper.
                  Not a trait of the picture escaped his brilliant and penetrating glance. His
                  laughing eye riveted itself upon every detail—on the forehead bathed in the dews
                  of slumber, the dusky lashes lying<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6146-00000095"/> on
                  the rosy cheeks, the glossy curls, which rose and fell with the tranquil breathing
                  of the maiden. He smiled as his gaze dwelt upon the little slippers, so prettily
                  arranged even in sleep; on the hand, glittering with a single diamond which hung
                  languidly over one arm of the chair; upon the tapering arms, the countenance
                  filled with maiden sweetness, and the fawn-colored dress, falling in ample folds
                  around the wearer's graceful figure.</p>
               <p>We doubt if even the most violent advocates of propriety will blame him, when he
                  cautiously approached, and bending down, took the disengaged hand and kissed it in
                  a cousinly way.</p>
               <p>But Miss Bonnybel did not awake. He looked at the volume lying on her lap. It was
                  the book of ballads which he had been reading to her on the morning when Lindon
                  interrupted them, and she had opened at the particular poem they had read
                  together.</p>
               <p>A slight color came to the young man's cheek. Let us pardon him—he was in love. He
                  hesitated what course to pursue, but, all at once, this hesitation disappeared.
                  His glance fell, with an audacious smile, upon the coquettish feet, and he had
                  fixed on his scheme. This scheme was simply to remove the rosettes, which were
                  secured by small silver buckles, from the shoes, to go into the hall and make some
                  noise which should arouse Miss Bonnybel, and then to enjoy, from his hiding place,
                  the young lady's surprise and confusion.</p>
               <p>He carefully set about his undertaking, and became so absorbed in it that he did
                  not see the maiden's head rise with a sudden movement, her eyes open, and fix
                  themselves upon him. He raised his head, however, to see if the sleeper was
                  undisturbed, and Miss Bonnybel closed her eyes, and drew a long, labored
                  breath—smiling, it seemed, in her sleep! The young man's smile replied to it, and
                  having detached one of the rosettes, he set about securing the other.</p>
               <p>Then it was that he heard suddenly the calm and satirical words,</p>
               <p>"Do n't you think that will do, sir? I should suppose that one was enough!"</p>
               <p>Thus caught in the act, Mr. Harry St. John remained for a moment dumbfoundered.
                  But recovering his equanimity, he said, laughing,</p>
               <p>"Did you compose yourself in that pretty attitude to receive me, Bonnybel?"</p>
               <p>"Humph! and you suppose I would take the trouble!"</p>
               <p>"You said you 'd put on your best gown and ruffles."</p>
               <p>"I was speaking satirically, sir! I suppose your vanity will not believe it—but,
                  pray, what are you doing to my feet?"</p>
               <p>"I was only taking off your rosettes. I should like to examine them; they 're very
                  pretty!"</p>
               <p>"I suspect you intended some trick! I know it, sir! But enough! You 'll please let
                  them alone!"</p>
               <p>And Miss Bonnybel withdrew her feet, vivaciously, from sight.</p>
               <p>"I feel profound remorse for my presumption," said Mr. St. John, in a contrite
                  tone; "let me atone for my offense, most beautiful lady. The culprit can only make
                  restitution—though your feet are dangerous things to approach! Hold them out!"</p>
               <p>Bonnybel hesitated, glancing doubtfully at him. But the young lady had lovely
                  feet, and her obduracy yielded to her vanity. She thrust out the extreme point of
                  the slipper deprived of its rosette, and Mr. St. John secured the ornament in its
                  place. He was so long doing so, however, that the young lady tapped her foot
                  impatiently, and then the wide folds of her dress swept over foot and slipper.</p>
               <p>"You see," said her companion, "I've come in obedience to your command. Where 's
                  uncle?"</p>
               <p>"They all went over to Maycock's," returned the young lady. "Heigho! I've had such
                  a dull time reading that love-sick ballad. It put me to sleep."</p>
               <p>And she yawned.</p>
               <p>"How I should like to take a ride," she added.</p>
               <pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6146-00000096"/>
               <p>"Would you? Then I'll go order your horse. Mine's at the door. Where shall we
                  go?"</p>
               <p>"Anywhere; say to 'Flower of Hundreds.'"</p>
               <p>"My old rattletrap? Well, so be it."</p>
               <p>And the young man went and ordered Miss Bonnybel's horse.</p>
               <p>They were soon galloping over the fields and through the forest, exchanging a
                  hundred jests, and an hour's ride brought them to their destination.</p>
               <p>"Flower of Hundreds," Mr. St. John's mansion, stood on an elevated plateau, near
                  the river. Instead of a "rattletrap," it was a fine old country house, with a
                  score of apartments, stables sufficient to accommodate a hundred horses, and a
                  servant for every pane in every window.</p>
               <p>They entered the fine old grounds, and the gray-haired African, left as major
                  domo, by his master, came and greeted them with dignity and respect. Half a dozen
                  negro boys ran to take their horses, and leaning lightly on the arm of her
                  cavalier, Miss Bonnybel held up her long skirt, and entered.</p>
               <p>Along the walls of the old antler-decorated hall hung the St. Johns, male and
                  female, of a dozen generations. A number of fox-hounds rose to welcome the
                  visitors, but, neglecting the young lady, bestowed their entire caresses upon the
                  young man.</p>
               <p>"See the small discrimination of the canine species," said St. John, "they neglect
                  'Beauty' for the notice of the 'Beast.'"</p>
               <p>"I always distrust your mock humility, and especially your compliments; the dogs
                  like you because they've had nobody else to like; you 're a miserable old
                  bachelor!"</p>
               <p>"So I am, but how can I help that?"</p>
               <p>"Humph! very easily. That is to say, sir, you can try!"</p>
               <p>And Miss Bonnybel gave her cousin an audacious glance, shot over her right
                  shoulder, and full of coquettish audacity.</p>
               <p>"What 's the use of trying?" he said. "'T is very easy to get married, but
                  difficult to get the girl one wants."</p>
               <p>"And <emph>she</emph> is to marry your lordship without being asked, I suppose!
                  That 's very reasonable indeed!"</p>
               <p>St. John looked steadily at his companion, to discover if the words meant more
                  than was expressed. But she darted from him, and ran into the great
                  sitting-room.</p>
               <p>"O! there 's my favorite portrait," she cried; "the picture of Sir Arthur St.
                  John, is n't it, of the time of his Majesty Charles II., who died for love? What a
                  noble face, with its pointed beard, and long, gay curling 'love locks!'"</p>
               <p>"'T is handsome indeed, but do you admire him for dying of love?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—to distraction! I wish he 'd courted me! He 'd never have died!"</p>
               <p>"Pity you did n't live in his Majesty's times," said St. John, with a glance of
                  admiration; "the Arthurs have all gone, and our hair to-day is cut close. You
                  might marry a gentleman of the St. Johns somewhere, but he'd be apt to look far
                  less romantic."</p>
               <p>It was Miss Bonnybel's turn to dart a look of curiosity at her cousin now, but she
                  read nothing in his face.</p>
               <p>With a sudden laugh, the conversation was turned by the young lady, and then they
                  ran all over the old mansion, prying into every nook, and laughing at every
                  thing.</p>
               <p>An hour passed thus, and then they remounted and returned to Vanely, where they
                  found the ladies of the family and the colonel.</p>
               <p>St. John related the scene at the Governor's, with many amusing exaggerations, but
                  he was glad at last to steal away into a corner with Bonnybel, who drew him toward
                  her with laughing glances.</p>
               <p>Thus passed several days, and, with every passing hour, the dazzling loveliness of
                  Miss Bonnybel increased in her lover's eyes, and he found his resolution failing
                  him.</p>
               <p>In their rides and walks, the damsel said a hundred careless<pb n="192-193"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000097"/> less things which made his pulse throb, and her
                  dangerous eyes gave meaning to her mischief.</p>
               <p>Who can paint such a compound, as she was, of audacity and reserve, of feeling and
                  mirth? who could place, in cold words, the light, and fire, and attraction of her
                  brilliant eyes? The present chronicler is unequal to the task. He sees her smiles
                  and coquetries, her pouts and blushes; he hears her laughter and her sighs, but he
                  can not describe them.</p>
               <p>Of what those days of constant meeting resulted in, he can tell with ease,
                  however. But even this trouble is spared him. By good fortune, he has a letter
                  from St. John to his friend Mr. Alston, and this will tell the tale.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>"WELL, Tom, I've got my <foreign xml:lang="LAT">quietus.</foreign> You've the
                  pleasure of hearing from a young gentleman who 's just been discarded!</p>
               <p>"Do you start, my dear friend? Does the event seem so very tremendous and
                  unexpected? I 'm sorry to shock your feelings, and would not do it for the world,
                  could I avoid it, but the fact is as I've stated.</p>
               <p>"I do not take the event with your equanimity; I am sufficiently miserable even to
                  satisfy the vanity of the young lady who has thought it decorous to give me many
                  reasons to believe that she returned my affection, and then to inform me that she
                  can't be my wife. You see I 'm angry, as well as unhappy. I do n't deny it, and I
                  think I 've some reason.</p>
               <p>"I went to Vanely on Saturday, and we rode hither, where we spent an hour, and
                  then returned; on Sunday, you remember, we met at church, and on Monday—but I 'm
                  prosing with a detail of my movements. I meant to say that on the visit here, in
                  all of our rides, and interviews, and conversations, I was fond enough to imagine
                  than I saw some indications of real love on Bonnybel's part. She declared that I
                  would find no difficulty in marrying, that faint heart never won fair lady,
                  upbraided me for not <emph>speaking,</emph> as if maidens could propose
                  themselves, and in a thousand different ways, led me to believe that she loved me,
                  and was willing to marry me.</p>
               <p>"On these hints I spoke; it was one evening at the trysting tree, the old oak at
                  the end of the lawn, you know, and I made myself clearly understood. You know
                  that, much as I may love a woman, I 'm not the man to kneel at her feet, and wipe
                  my eyes, and whine out, '<emph>please</emph> love me!' On the contrary, I told
                  Miss Bonnybel simply that I loved her truly, and asked her to marry me.</p>
               <p>"You should have seen her look when I spoke thus. She became crimson, and was
                  silent for a time. Then—but hang it, Tom! I can't fill the chair of the historian.
                  She discarded me—that 's all. She had the greatest affection for me, 't was true,
                  she said, but she was over young to marry yet; she 'd not made up her mind—it was
                  unfair in me to thus make her feel pain—she would always love me as her dear
                  cousin and playmate—then she raised her white handkerchief to her eyes, and begged
                  me to reconduct her to the house.</p>
               <p>"I did so in silence, and then discovered that I had important business here. That
                  's all.</p>
               <p>"Well! I'll neither cut my throat, nor sit down and weep, nor, worst of all, go
                  crouching back to her, like a dog! Henceforth I forswear the sex. A bachelor's
                  life for me, my boy. Come, take a main at tric-trac with me, and help me to find
                  the bottom of a cask of Bordeaux or Jamaica. I 'm moping, you see, and want
                  company.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>"YOUR letter really astonished me, my dear boy—it did, upon my word. You will
                  permit me to observe that you are really the most unreasonable and exacting of all
                  the lovers that I've read of, from the time of Achilles to the present hour.</p>
               <p>"And so, when you pointed your gun at the tree, the bird did not flutter down and
                  light on your shoulder! Or say that you banged away, my boy, do you expect such a
                  wild little thing as Miss Bonnybel to sit and be shot at by you? You discharge
                  your fowling piece, and before the smoke 's cleared away, walk tranquilly up to
                  pick up the game; you find that your aim was bad, and there 's no bird on the
                  ground, and you scowl, and growl, and complain of her for not falling!</p>
               <p>"'My son,' I would say to you, as I 'm told the great King Solomon did on one
                  occasion, 'listen to the words of the wise; wisdom is the principal thing,' he
                  adds, 'therefore get wisdom, and with all thy getting, get understanding.'</p>
               <p>"Curious and complex, O my beloved friend, is the heart of woman. Many
                  philosophers have written concerning them, but they are hard to understand. But
                  one thing I am sure of, that the young ladies of the province of Virginia object
                  to falling without due warning—subsiding, hysterically, into the embrace of any
                  young man who is good enough to hold out his arms. And you will pardon my
                  declaring my opinion that it is reasonable; were I a woman, as that engaging young
                  lady, Miss Tracy, says I am already, I 'd demand a siege of a decade! 'T is true I
                  should be verging toward forty by that time, but I 'd possess the inestimable
                  satisfaction of reflecting that I 'd passed my life in worrying a young man.</p>
               <p>"You dissent, perhaps, from my views, but, honestly now, do you think you gave
                  Miss Bonnybel 'sufficient notice' of the intended movement in your 'suit?' 'Tis a
                  charming damsel (though of course much less so than <emph>a certain
                  person</emph>), and I fancy she resents your cavalier assault, your ferocious
                  charge, as though your banner were inscribed, 'Marriage or instant death!!!' And
                  then you go on to complain of her bright eyes, of her chance-uttered words and
                  jests. Really, my dear Harry, you are a perfect ogre. You can't let a maiden
                  display her liking, and smile, and look attractive, and please you! Suppose all
                  the world was of your way of thinking! What a dull, stiff, artificial world it
                  would be. Just think, my dear fellow, of the awful result. No laughter, no ogling,
                  no flirting any more! The true joy of our existence would disappear, the girls
                  would be lifeless statues. <emph>You</emph> may fancy a statue of marble for your
                  spouse, but I 'd rather have a nice young woman of the real world, with her
                  dangerous smiles, and head bent sidewise! Do you say that a friend of mine at
                  Vanely is not such as this? I can only reply that my tastes were not formed when I
                  met her. I adore her, 't is true, but logically speaking, I 'm wrong.</p>
               <p>"Take my word for it, some day, your bird will descend; shake the tree, and the
                  fruit will fall. Imitate an unappreciated friend of yours, and still continue the
                     shaking.<ref rend="super" target="#note_016" xml:id="return_016">*</ref>

               <p>THE views of his friend had little effect upon St. John. It was not his pride
                  which was so deeply wounded; it was his heart.</p>
               <p>His letter was one of those tissues of self-deception, which are woven to blind
                  their eyes by the most clear seeing. He loved the girl more than ever when he
                  found her beyond his reach, and his faint flush of anger gave way to misery.</p>
               <p>It was not long, however, before this sentiment also yielded. The first pangs of
                  his disappointment gradually became less poignant. He coolly set about seeing to
                  his neglected affairs on the estate, and having attended to every thing, and wound
                  up the machine, cast about him for some occupation to divert his thoughts.</p>
               <p>"I'll go to town," he said, with a sardonic smile; "I'll go give his Excellency a
                  chance to arrest me! What an admirable scene will be enacted if he tries it;
                  perhaps the cause will be affected by my act, and historians will put my name in
                  their books!"</p>
               <p>The real object of the young man was to divert his mind from thought, and he had
                  no sooner conceived his plan than he proceeded to execute it.</p>
               <p>Mounting "Tallyho," he rode to the nearest ferry, crossed the river, and
                  approached the capital as the sun was setting. He went along carelessly through
                  the forest illumined by the orange light, and with eyes fixed on the ground, gave
                  free rein to his thoughts. He did not observe that his horse had taken a wrong
                  turn in the road, and was aroused from his abstraction suddenly by a voice. This
                  voice, which seemed that of a child, said,</p>
               <p>"Won't you stop a minute, sir? I 'm very glad to see you!"</p>
               <p>In the little maiden who spoke, he recognized Blossom, and she stood at the gate
                  of the small cottage, which smiled on him, embowered in foliage and flowers.</p>
               <p>"Will I stop? Why with pleasure, my little spring blossom;" replied the young man,
                  pleased with the fair face; "I am not the least in a hurry, and I am glad to see
                  you in turn."</p>
               <p>With these words he dismounted, and securing Tallyho, shook hands with Blossom,
                  and followed her to the trellised porch.</p>
               <p>"My dear, you are the very image of your namesakes," he said, caressing the
                  child's hair; "where did you get such roses?"</p>
               <p>Blossom took a cluster of buds from her bosom, and said—</p>
               <p>"They are from the flower-bed yonder, sir."</p>
               <p>St. John smiled.</p>
               <p>"I mean the roses in your cheeks, my dear; they are prettier than the others."</p>
               <p>"Oh it 's nothing but running about playing," said Blossom, blushing, "I run
                  sometimes as far as town, sir, you know—as I did that day—"</p>
               <p>"When my horse nearly killed you—yes," said St. John; "well he 'll never do so any
                  more. I saw our friend, the Governor, the other day, and I 'm happy to say for the
                  last time as his servant."</p>
               <p>"Oh! I hope you did not quarrel, sir! he 's a dreadful man!"</p>
               <p>"Quarrel?" said St. John, with his sardonic smile, "what put such a thought in
                  your head? Why his Excellency and<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6146-00000100"/>
                  myself fairly dote upon each other, and the room was full of the first gentlemen
                  of the colony, invited to attend and meet me! His lordship talked more with me
                  than with any one else, and when I went away, called a soldier to escort me!"</p>
               <p>Having made this elaborate jest, St. John smiled on Blossom.</p>
               <p>"Oh! I 'm very, very glad that you did n't quarrel!" she said, "he 's so fierce
                  looking, and spoke so cruelly of papa."</p>
               <p>"Of your father? Oh yes, I remember—where is he, Blossom?"</p>
               <p>"I do n't know, sir."</p>
               <p>"Ah?"</p>
               <p>"I never know where papa goes, sir," she said, simply, "I believe he has a great
                  deal to do."</p>
               <p>As she spoke horse's feet were heard, and Blossom jumped up crying,</p>
               <p>"Oh there he is, sir!"</p>
               <p>At the same moment a gentleman entered the gate.</p>
               <p>In the father of the child whom he had so nearly crushed beneath the hoofs of his
                  horse, St. John recognized the stranger of the old church at Richmond.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE WOOF OF EVENTS.</head>
               <p>THE stranger was clad in black, as formerly, and his face wore the same expression
                  of iron calmness. His penetrating eyes were full of collected strength, and when
                  he greeted St. John in his deep and resounding voice, the young man felt again
                  that he was in the presence of a remarkable individual.</p>
               <p>"I am glad to see you again, Mr. St. John," said the stranger, with an iron-like
                  grasp of the slender white hand. "I believe I need not introduce myself—as my
                  child has told you my name."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Mr. Waters," returned St. John, "and we can not meet as strangers. 'T is
                  true, I come ill recommended, since my horse nearly killed your child."</p>
               <p>The stranger made a movement with his hand.</p>
               <p>"Do not speak of that," he said, "'t was no fault of yours. The real offender was
                  Dunmore, and I congratulate you on leaving his service."</p>
               <p>"You have heard, then, of my resignation?"</p>
               <p>"Assuredly. I have even heard every particular of the interview at the palace. I
                  knew all, half an hour after it occurred."</p>
               <p>"Pray how was that possible?"</p>
               <p>"In the simplest way—the society I represent has friends everywhere."</p>
               <p>"You seem to know every thing. Did you recognize me yonder in the old church of
                  Richmond?"</p>
               <p>"Undoubtedly, sir; how could I fail to? You have been for some time a public
                  character, and I knew perfectly your opinions before I spoke. If in what I said, I
                  was carried away by a rush of bitter memories into egotism, you will not think
                  harshly of it, and will pardon me—will you not, sir?"</p>
               <p>There was so much simplicity and nobility in the air of the speaker that St. John,
                  unconsciously, held out his hand.</p>
               <p>"You did me an honor, sir," he said, "in confiding your misfortunes to me. I trust
                  we shall be friends."</p>
               <p>"We are such already, I am sure," said his companion; "your words in the old
                  church yonder stirred my pulses, and your reply to the insults of Dunmore, in his
                  palace, was the reply of a fearless patriot and gentleman."</p>
               <p>St. John bowed low.</p>
               <p>"Thanks!" he said, "but I merely defended myself. Was any action taken in regard
                  to my humble self?"</p>
               <p>"None. Dunmore and Captain Foy had more critical business. Do you know what they
                  were doing, and are doing<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6146-00000101"/> ing now? They
                  are devising a plan to embroil the people of Pennsylvania and Virginia on the
                  subject of the boundary line, and further, to invite the savages to invade the
                  western frontier of the province."</p>
               <p>"Impossible!"</p>
               <p>"So it is," said the stranger; "the agent of these traitorous schemes to crush
                  Virginia in the coming revolution is a man named Conolly, commandant at Fort Pitt;
                  he is now in Williamsburg awaiting instructions. Those instructions were being
                  drawn up in cipher by Foy, without the knowledge of the council, on the day you
                  appeared before the Governor."</p>
               <p>St. John's head fell, and his brows contracted.</p>
               <p>"Why 't is nothing less than treachery—blood—murder!" he said.</p>
               <p>"Precisely that,"said the stranger, coolly.</p>
               <p>"And I! am I forgotten?"</p>
               <p>"As yet nothing has been done; a new lieutenant has been appointed; the matter
                  waits. But I advise you to lie down armed. I am a peaceful man, but I rarely move
                  unprepared. I would advise you to do the same."</p>
               <p>A careless movement of the stranger's hand threw open the breast of his doublet.
                  From a side pocket protruded the dark handles of a brace of pistols.</p>
               <p>"Events ripen," he continued, "and the times grow dangerous. This very day, sir, a
                  great movement has been made. The Burgesses have resolved that the Boston Port
                  bill is dangerous to liberty—the dispatch of troops thither an act of oppression.
                  The first of June is appointed as a day of fasting, humiliation and prayer; to
                  implore divine Providence to give them courage and heart to oppose this invasion
                  of Right. In accordance with this act, it was further resolved this morning that
                  the Burgesses, on the day appointed, will proceed with the speaker and the mace to
                  church, there to pray for the cause of America. Such are the resolves, and they
                  will answer the purpose."</p>
               <p>"The purpose?"</p>
               <p>"To force the Governor to dissolve them."</p>
               <p>"Do you think he will?"</p>
               <p>"To-morrow."</p>
               <p>"Ah! and then?"</p>
               <p>"The rest is arranged—prepared."</p>
               <p>"Can you speak?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, to you, friend. We are alone here, and I know whom I address. The House of
                  Burgesses will be dissolved to-morrow. The members will, on the next morning, meet
                  in the Raleigh tavern, and eighty-five, perhaps eighty-nine, of them, will unite
                  in an association to arouse the colonies, through a committee of correspondence,
                  to a general congress, binding themselves to use nothing from the docks of the
                  East India Company. They will then leave Williamsburg. They will every one be
                  reëlected by the people. They will meet here again on the first day of August, and
                  their work then will be to cement the disjointed resistance North and South, and
                  appoint deputies to the general congress. That congress will meet, probably, in
                  Philadelphia, and much will depend upon its proceedings."</p>
               <p>"The Governor will dissolve the Burgesses to-morrow?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, at three in the afternoon he will summon them before him, as though he were
                  majesty itself, and then he will dismiss the chivalry and wisdom of this land like
                  disobedient school-boys. Would you see the proceeding? I will meet you at the door
                  of the capitol."</p>
               <p>St. John was silent, only assenting with a thoughtful movement of his head.</p>
               <p>"Your long labor is then beginning to produce results?" he said, looking at his
                  companion.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said the stranger; "yet not mine alone. I am but a poor soldier in a noble
                  army; an army of strong arms and great hearts, which advances under the leadership
                  of the Almighty, who directs and guides its onward march."</p>
               <p>As the stranger spoke, his companion again observed that look which had formerly
                  attracted his attention,<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6146-00000102"/> —the
                  expression of an intellectual fanatic who has but one idea, and is bent and swayed
                  by a pursuit which is his life blood.</p>
               <p>"What we have just been discussing," he said, "these resolutions, and debates, and
                  associations, these are are but the husks of ideas, the shells in which principles
                  are wrapped, the costume and material frame. There is beneath all this, the heart
                  and the soul, the vital idea, which must clothe itself thus for action. To read
                  the annals of history, without eternally keeping in view the existence and
                  superintendence of that Almighty Being, under whose breath we move, is to paralyze
                  the mind with a chaos of unmeaning and discordant elements, a jumble of effects
                  without causes. The voice of God resounds to my ears through the long galleries of
                  history, and I see His footprints on the soil of every land. It is that great
                  Being who shapes, in silence and darkness, the far-off result, who strikes, when
                  he is ready, with his thunderbolts. It is not from a clear sky that these
                  thunderbolts fall; it is only when the atmosphere is prepared that he unharnesses
                  his lightnings. It is only when the political atmosphere has reached the requisite
                  state that he lets loose the thunderbolts of revolution.</p>
               <p>"I wish to say," continued the stranger, with his far-away look, "that under all
                  these resolutions and business details, these husks and shells, is the living and
                  vital idea, the onward march of man. Every word and phrase in these papers we have
                  referred to, embodies a thought crammed with significance; every new expression,
                  growing bolder and bolder, is like the increase in the height of the waves when
                  the storm sweeps onward. From the year '65 to the present hour, I have looked with
                  awe and wonder upon the gradually unfolding intent of the Deity. I have seen this
                  land advance toward a new and splendid existence, as a ship is impelled by the
                  breath of the hurricane. I have seen the great multitude advance, step by step,
                  pushed onward by an invisible hand toward the bloody gates of revolution, through
                  which, and which alone, shall we enter on the promised land of liberty. We spoke,
                  yonder, of this, and I then said that I thought I saw how to each one his part was
                  assigned. To Patrick Henry, that soul of fire, and prophet of liberty, was
                  assigned the duty of putting the huge ball in motion. He was raised up at the
                  crisis and did the work which the Deity assigned to him; he struck, as it were,
                  with the flat of his sword, and aroused the whole land to indignation. In his
                  fiery and burning periods, in his immense denunciations, the oppressions of
                  England shone forth in all their deformity. He did no half work; beneath his
                  gigantic shoulder, the ball of revolution began to move.<ref rend="super"
                     target="#note_017" xml:id="return_017">*</ref> But the immense mass must move
                  in its appointed way; it must not roll at random; its course must be fixed. And to
                  fix this course, to define the revolution, its track and its aims, to the public
                  opinion of Europe and America, Thomas Jefferson appeared, a man who has just begun
                  his career, but whose genius for overturning is immense. See here, too, the hand
                  of the Deity; see this wonder and mystery of his decrees. This man, thus raised up
                  to fulfill the divine purpose, is an infidel, has no particle of reverence; for
                  him, Christ is but a name. The Almighty has removed the faculty of reverence
                  completely from his intellect, and he advances over thrones and systems, through
                  prejudice and prestige, with a fatal, a mathematical precision. He carries out his
                  premises to the bounds of and beyond pure treason; like a machine, his splendid
                  intellect does not stop to reflect, but accomplishes its work without pausing.
                  Well, sir, see how, in these two men, who utter and define the revolution—see how
                  God has raised up, at the appointed time, the instruments with which he designs to
                  produce his results. I said, up yonder, and I repeat, that the military leader
                  will appear in good time; I doubt it not at all—I expect without impatience—I
                  calmly await the appointed moment. Who knows what the hand of God has been doing?
                  Perhaps, as we have passed our serene existence here in the midst of civilization,
                  and surrounded by comforts—perhaps <note place="foot" xml:id="note_017">

                  <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6146-00000103"/> some lonely youth, in the wilds of the
                  forest, fording great rivers, and ascending vast mountains, has been trained in
                  peril, and suffering, and hardship, for the leadership of liberty. Perhaps, as we
                  speak, this man is ready to appear; let us wait, let us trust in God.</p>
               <p>"But I weary you," said the stranger. "I forget that the philosophy of history, as
                  the schoolmen say, may not interest you as it does myself. What my brief and
                  awkward train of thought would utter is this, and this alone: that for ten years
                  these colonies have been slowly advancing, led by the Almighty, as he led the
                  Israelites of old, to a point from which they can not recede, where they can not
                  stand still, when, consequently, they must press onward, even though it be through
                  the Red Sea of revolution and blood. The seeds of liberty were sown in the
                  opposition to the Stamp Act; they have sprung up and spread into a tree, whose
                  iron grain will blunt the sharpest battle-ax. In '65, the alarm was sounded by the
                  voice of Patrick Henry, and reverberating from cliff to cliff, it will mingle, in
                  '75, with the roar of cannon, the trumpet blast of battle! Do not mistake or
                  misunderstand, I beseech you!" said the stranger, with his dazzling and fiery
                  glance. "Revolution is logical, mathematical, but it is the logic, the mathematics
                  of God! It is God, sir, who directs us poor puppets beneath him; it is God who has
                  made all things work together harmoniously to this splendid result; it is God who,
                  having aroused our minds, and strengthened our souls, will also give us victory in
                  the struggle. For my part I do not fear the result; I look forward, I pray, I
                  wait!"</p>
               <p>The stranger was silent, and for some time nothing disturbed the stillness. At
                  last Blossom stole out, thinking the conversation was over, and came to her
                  father.</p>
               <p>The gloomy and wistful eyes grew clear, the lips relaxed from their compressed
                  expression, and a sad smile played over the stranger's face.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps, after all, it is better to listen to the heart," he said, "and happy is
                  the man who does not feel compelled to espouse the cause of his species. Poor
                  intellect which has not a heart!"</p>
               <p>And with a sad and wistful look, the stranger passed his white hand over the
                  child's bright curls.</p>
               <p>Blossom took the hand and pressed it to her lips, at the moment when Mr. St. John
                  rose to depart.</p>
               <p>To the stranger's courteous invitation to remain, he urged business in town, and
                  so they separated, appointing to meet at the capitol.</p>
               <p>Blossom, too, had her little speech, which was a request that her friend would
                  please come again, and this promise being given, the young man set forward to
                  Williamsburg again as the night fell.</p>
               <p>A singular idea occurred to him as he rode onward.</p>
               <p>The man whom he had just left, with every thing which surrounded him, seemed a
                  living protest against the old world and the past. The cottage, with its low roof,
                  hidden in the wood, from which issued a man whose spirit aroused revolution, was
                  the direct antagonist of kings' palaces and courts. As the palace, and the king in
                  his royal trappings, were the incarnation of privilege and prerogative, and
                  superstition, so the cottage in the wild forest, and the plain man in black, were
                  the representatives of liberty, disenthrallment—of that freedom of thought and
                  soul which the new world must inaugurate.</p>
               <p>The child before him, young, weak, and so nearly crushed to death beneath the
                  hoofs of his horse, was the type of Virginia, which the legions of Great Britain
                  would soon strive to trample down!</p>
               <p>He reached Williamsburg and his lodgings before he was aware of it. Wearied with
                  the long ride from "Flower of Hundreds," he was soon asleep.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE FIXED STARS OF VIRGINIA.</head>
               <p>ST. JOHN was awakened by the sunbeams falling on his forehead.</p>
               <p>It was the 26th of May, 1774, a day memorable in the annals of Virginia.</p>
               <p>As though to cheer and embolden the hearts of patriots, the great orb of day rose
                  clear and brilliant, and mounted to his noon unobscured by clouds, as on that
                  occasion in the old church of St. John, when the stranger had pointed to it,
                  soaring above the retreating thunder storm, and called it "the Sun of
                  America."</p>
               <p>At an early hour, the entire capital was in commotion, for the news had gotten
                  abroad that on this day Lord Dunmore would dissolve the Assembly. The crowd
                  continued to increase throughout the morning, and at three in the afternoon, it
                  poured in one living mass toward the capitol, in front of whose wide portico the
                  statue of the good Lord Botetourt looked down with calm serenity upon the
                  multitude.</p>
               <p>But since the days of that honest nobleman, men and events, unhappily, have
                  changed. Other times have come, and another Governor rules in the chair of
                  Norborne Berkeley.</p>
               <p>Lord Botetourt, it is true, had also dissolved the Burgesses, but sadly,
                  sorrowfully, with the reluctance of a man who acknowledges in his heart the
                  justice of a protest, but is forced, by his sworn duty, to oppose himself to the
                  protestants. The worthy nobleman loved Virginia and the Virginians, and many
                  persons said that the oppressions of the ministry had hastened his death. However
                  that may be, one thing is certain, that soon after his dissolution of the
                  Burgesses, this statue of him was commanded by that body; and having been duly
                  erected before the capitol, to be removed moved afterwards to the college grounds,
                  where it may now be seen, the marble image of the good nobleman, on this May day
                  of'74, looked tranquilly upon the masses ruled now by——Dunmore.</p>
               <p>Let history, with her inexorable justice, her cold stylus, fill the space left
                  blank before the name. The present writer disdains to attempt the task, leaving to
                  others the duty of depicting one who united in his character the most perfect
                  treachery, the utmost cowardice, and the most consistent and harmonious
                  meanness.</p>
               <p>But let us follow St. John.</p>
               <p>The whole population, as we have said, flowed toward the old capitol, along
                  Gloucester street, as, on the day of Lady Dunmore's entry, in an opposite
                  direction toward the palace. But now it seemed agitated by far different emotions.
                  Then it had shouted and laughed, now it was silent and frowned. Then it saw a
                  cavalcade, brilliant with the bright eyes and smiling faces of a good woman and
                  her beautiful daughters, and it smiled gladly in return. Now it was about to
                  behold the haughty progress of a bad man, with a scowling face, surrounded by his
                  mercenary attendants. And the people scowled honestly back in advance, and looked
                  sidewise, with a threatening air, at the guards when they appeared.</p>
               <p>St. John was carried onward by the crowd to the base of Lord Botetourt's statue,
                  where the waves of the multitude were divided, and flowed right and left.</p>
               <p>It was with immense difficulty that he succeeded in elbowing his way up to the
                  portico. At last, however, he attained his position, and then his glance surveyed
                  the long street, with its undulating and imposing occupants, its old men with gray
                  beards, and maidens in picturesque dresses, and curiously peering children, lost
                  like flowers in the waves.</p>
               <p>He was still absorbed in this scrutiny when he felt a hand on his arm, and a calm
                  voice said,</p>
               <p>"An interesting spectacle, friend; the curiosity of the multitude seems
                  general."</p>
               <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6146-00000105"/>
               <p>He turned, and found himself face to face with the stranger, who added with a
                  grave inclination, as he leaned against a pillar, and thoughtfully surveyed the
                  crowd,</p>
               <p>"We are punctual to our appointment, Mr. St. John; I have been awaiting you,
                  however, as the Burgesses are awaiting the Governor."</p>
               <p>St. John pressed the extended hand, and said,</p>
               <p>"I should like to look at the House. Will we have time before the Governor
                  arrives?"</p>
               <p>"He will not come for twenty minutes."</p>
               <p>"Well then let us go into the gallery, and you shall point out to me some of the
                  leaders."</p>
               <p>"Willingly."</p>
               <p>And in a moment they were in the gallery of the Burgesses.</p>
               <p>The speaker sat opposite in a tall chair, clearly relieved against a red curtain,
                  held aloft by an ornamental rod.<ref rend="super" target="#note_018"
                     xml:id="return_018">*</ref> Beneath, sat the clerk of the House, behind his
                  table littered with bills; before him on the table lay the great mace, which
                  signified that the body was in full session. When they sat in Committee of the
                  Whole, it was laid <emph>under</emph> the table.</p>

               <p>The members were scattered throughout the hall, talking earnestly in groups, and
                  scarcely heeding the hammer and cry of "Order, gentlemen!"</p>
               <p>"Strange to say I have not before visited the present House," said St. John; "'t
                  is my loss, for they have a most imposing air."</p>
               <p>"It is the reflex of their mental characteristics," said the stranger. "The body
                  before you, friend, contains the great leaders of Virginia—the burning and shining
                  lights of the coming storm. Look, there, in front of the speaker. Do you know the
                  member in the peach-blossom coat, with the tie-wig and the worn red cloak?"</p>
               <p>"I have seen him pass on the street I think: yes, one day, talking with Mr.
                     Carrington."<ref rend="super" target="#note_019" xml:id="return_019">†</ref>

               <p>"That is Patrick Henry," continued the stranger, "the prophet and king of the
                  revolution that comes onward, the torch which illumines the way. He was born in
                  Hanover, among the slashes, and after a youth spent in idleness, studied law, and
                  appeared in the 'Parsons' cause.' The rest of his career you are familiar with.
                  The burning eloquence which drove the clergy in despair from their seats in the
                  court house, soared to heaven like a flame of fire in the days of the Stamp Act
                  agitation, in '65. At this moment, that awkward-looking man, with the listless air
                  and the stooping shoulders, is the grandest orator on the continent of America,
                  and none in the old world compare with him. Heaven sends but one such man in a
                  thousand years. It sent Demosthenes, and now it sends this greater than
                  Demosthenes. Sir, I weary you, but this man, the very sight of him, arouses me. He
                  will rule and sway, in right of his genius, the storm which is rushing
                  downward!"</p>
               <p>St. John looked at the ungainly figure, and could not realize the truth of what he
                  heard. It was simply a slouching county court lawyer that he saw.</p>
               <p>"I see that you think I am enthusiastic," said the stranger; "you think that this
                  man in the old worn coat—this man of the people—is unequal to the task I
                     describe.<ref rend="super" target="#note_020" xml:id="return_020">*</ref> Hear

                  hear the thunder of an oratory which will shake the throne of England, and

                  continued,</p>
               <p>"Those two gentlemen in front of the speaker must be known to you. The one whose
                  tall figure is bowed by the weight of seventy years, with the deep blue eyes
                  protected by a green shade—that is Colonel Richard Bland, of 'Jordan's,' in Prince

                  'Inquiry into the Rights of the American Colonies,' whose logic advances with the
                  resounding roll of an avalanche. He is descended from Giles Bland, who fought with
                  Bacon—is called, for his great acquisitions, 'The Antiquary of Virginia,'—at
                  seventy, and when almost blind, he still puts on the old harness in the service of

               <p>"I know Colonel Bland," said St. John, "and his companion—"</p>
               <p>"Is Mr. George Wythe, one of the most learned gentlemen of the province. His
                  mother taught him Latin and Greek in his childhood. He drew the celebrated
                  memorial to the Commons in '64; he is second to no one in patriotism. But these
                  men are but units in a noble line. See, yonder, Mr. Thomas Nelson, from the town
                  of York; see his gentle smile, and the suavity that beams in his features. He is
                  capable of giving his time, his means, his very lifeblood to his country. And
                  there beside him is Mr. Robert Carter Nicholas—thin-featured, growing bald, of
                  grave bearing; he is a sound financier and far-seeing statesman. You know the tall
                  and portly gentleman with whom he converses. It it Mr. Benjamin Harrison, of
                  'Berkeley,' on James river. In his veins flows the blood of Harrison the Regicide,
                  the man who was prominent in condemning Charles I. to death. He is a man of the

               <p>"I do not know Mr. Marshall, but his face is attractive," returned St. John.</p>
               <p>"But you doubtless know that tall gentleman to his right. That is Mr. Edmund
                  Pendleton of Caroline, the type and representative of the conservative
                  revolutionists—the <emph>thinkers</emph> who desire to advance, logically, and in
                  well-ordered phalanx. You read in his bearing, in his very countenance, the
                  character of the man—the man whom I regard as equally valuable to the revolution
                  with Mr. Henry and Mr. Jefferson. Mr. Pendleton is profoundly read in the laws
                  binding nations and individuals; his conservative genius curbs the fiery and rash
                  minds of the passionate reformers; his familiarity with forms and parliamentary
                  rules, will be of indispensable value to the cause. In debate he is wholly
                  unsurpassed by any man in North America, and in the fiercest encounter of the
                  sharpest weapons 't is impossible to throw him off his guard. His noble and serene
                  bearing is a great aid to his oratory; his suavity and grace conciliate the
                  rudest. No finer type exists of the courtly gentleman. If Henry is our
                  Demosthenes, Pendleton is our Cicero; his silvery voice steals away your

                  but not a member of the present Burgesses. He is a man of the profoundest
                  political genius, not second even to Mr. Jefferson. A statesman of the very first

               <p>"Ah! you spoke warmly of him, sir, when we talked," said St. John.</p>
               <p>"Not more warmly than I should have done," replied the stranger. "See the
                     <emph>pen</emph> of the revolution; you have looked at Henry, the
                     <emph>tongue.</emph> You may discern in the countenance of this gentleman, too,
                  his whole character. See his broad, swelling forehead, with thin sandy hair; his
                  prominent nose, thin lips and resolute chin; see, above all, his piercing and
                  clear eye. It is the face of a man with a genius essentially political; a mind
                  which arrives, with a single bound, at conclusions which startle the boldest. In
                  this man, as in Mr. George Mason, the revolution vindicates itself to history; the
                  true representative of a convulsed epoch, he will guide and direct great events.
                  His glance of lightning has already flashed through the cobwebs and ruins of
                  feudalism, the trappings of royalty and nobility; he believes in nothing, trusts
                  to nothing, accepts nothing which is not clearly <emph>proved</emph> by the
                  doctrine of inalienable right! Before the fatal advance of his inexorable logic,
                  royalty, aristocracy and religious intolerance yield, one after another, and are
                  overthrown. His faults are those of a genius too youthful and fiery; his views are
                  extreme, and need the mellowing hand of time to harmonize them, but still he is
                  the man for the times, the gladiator for the present arena!"</p>
               <p>As the stranger uttered these words, a stifled sound from the great crowd without
                  was heard, and the Burgesses gathered in more earnest groups than before.</p>
               <p>"The moment has come!" said the stranger, taking St. John's arm, "let us go look
                  on; but first, see that great figure which has risen but now, the man who stands
                  surrounded by Henry, Mason, and Nelson, and Jefferson, and young Marshall, who is
                  as tall as the lofty General Lewis, of Botetourt, beside him. Ah! I see you know
                  him. Yes, that is Colonel George Washington, of 'Mount Vernon,' in Fairfax. He
                  sustained the whole frontier on his shoulders, fought with Braddock, and is now a
                  member of the Burgesses. I have spoken of the tongue and the pen of the
                  revolution, friend. If Providence so wills it, see the <emph>sword.</emph>"</p>
               <p>And without further words the stranger led the way from the gallery. In a moment
                  they again stood on the portico of the capitol.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIX.</head>
               <head type="sub">HOW THE STRANGER'S FIRST PROPHECY WAS FULFILLED.</head>
               <p>THE movement and murmur in the crowd had been caused by the approach of Lord
                  Dunmore.</p>
               <p>The two men had arrived just in time.</p>
               <p>From the portico upon which they were stationed, above the statue of Botetourt,
                  and the undulating masses, their glances embraced the whole spectacle.</p>
               <p>The approach of his Excellency was announced by a handfull of his guards who rode
                  before, royally, to clear the way. Then a larger detachment appeared riding
                  abreast in front of the chariot, the plumes of a troop of like number revealing
                  themselves plainly in the rear.</p>
               <p>At the head of the troop in front rode a tall and magnificently accoutred
                  gentleman, and as the cavalcade drew on, St. John started slightly.</p>
               <p>The new commander of his Excellency's guards was Mr. Lindon.</p>
               <p>The young man's lip curled.</p>
               <p>"Ah well!" he said, carelessly, "I congratulate his Excellency on securing such a
                  fine captain, and Mr. Lindon on entering the service of such a master. They'll
                  suit each other to a marvel."</p>
               <p>Having thus expressed his view of the matter, St. John continued to gaze at the
                  procession with a curling lip and a sort of wonder, as he thought that, but a
                  short time before, Lindon's position was his own.</p>
               <p>His Excellency drew on.</p>
               <p>Having a profound conviction that the easiest mode of ruling the human species,
                  was to awe and dazzle them in advance, his lordship had made great preparations
                  for the present ceremony, and in the programme, so to speak, had studied to
                  imitate the royal model.</p>
               <p>As the guards sent before were to represent those troops sent in advance of
                  royalty to cry, "make way! make way for his majesty!" and as the larger
                  detachments were to still further carry out the idea and the resemblance, and awe
                  the masses into terror and submission, so, in the selection of his equipage
                  itself, the Governor had endeavored to dazzle the eyes, as with the splendor and
                  state of a king.</p>
               <p>The chariot was a huge affair, covered with gilding, and velvet, and damask; a
                  dozen footmen in liveries seemed to hang behind and at the sides, and a driver
                  with a hat bound with gold lace, looked grandly downward on the heads of the
                  common people, through whom he urged onward his six glossy horses, when the guards
                  allowed the mass to close in.</p>
               <p>His Excellency was accompanied only by Captain Foy and Lord Fincastle, the
                  secretary or captain, as the reader pleases, preserving his habitual expression of
                  serenity. His dark eyes shining from his pale face, quietly surveyed the crowd
                  with a species of philosophical composure, and then were again lowered
                  thoughtfully.</p>
               <p>The chariot paused before the front of the capitol, and the Governor issued forth,
                  in the midst of a profound silence.</p>
               <p>He raised his head haughtily, as a king, who is not met with the shouts and
                  acclamations he expects, might do, and then, taking a comprehensive view of the
                  crowd, ascended to the council chamber, followed by the secretary and Lord
                  Fincastle.</p>
               <p>"Come," said the stranger to St. John, "let us see the rest; there is a gallery I
                  know of from which we may see all."</p>
               <p>And with a rapid step he led the way up a narrow and winding stair, and with a key
                  which he took from his pocket, opened a low door beneath the ceiling.</p>
               <p>From behind the high railing of the small, circular gallery, the eyes of the two
                  men looked into the council chamber.</p>
               <p>The members of the council, who had already assembled,<pb n="216-217"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000109"/> rose upon the Governor's entrance, and saluted
                  him—also, his companions.</p>
               <p>Lord Dunmore then took his seat in the large carved chair of red damask, at the
                  end of the council table, with Lord Fincastle and Captain Foy at his side, the
                  members remaining in their former seats.</p>
               <p>A pause of some moments followed the arrangement of every one in his place, and
                  during this time his lordship's countenance wore an expression at once haughty and
                  nervous, disdainful and anxious.</p>
               <p>He cleared his throat, arranged with nervous hands some papers before him, and
                  then, leaning back in his chair, said,</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen of the council, I have summoned you to meet me here to-day in order
                  that I may express to you, briefly, the reasons for the course I am about to
                  adopt. I shall be extremely brief, for my resolution is taken, and I shall not be
                  swerved from my purpose.</p>
               <p>"It is scarcely necessary for me to inform you, gentlemen," continued the
                  Governor, haughtily, but, as he thought, with dignity, "that seditious persons and
                  enemies to the government in this colony have for a series of years been
                  disturbing the public tranquillity, and even proceeding to what is constructive
                  treason, and would be held such under the 25th Edward III."</p>
               <p>St. John exchanged a glance with the stranger, who moved his head slightly, but
                  again riveted his cold look on the Governor.</p>
               <p>"The men that I speak of, gentlemen, are not, I believe, members of the Burgesses,
                  who heretofore, except upon certain occasions, have conducted themselves
                  respectfully toward the government and its representatives in the colonies. The
                  persons I refer to are those who have printed and circulated seditious pamphlets,
                  some of which I have seen purporting even to be issued in this capital. I have
                  information that a man named Waters is the most active agent and desseminator of
                  these papers, and I shall, at an early day, take steps to arrest and send him for
                  trial to England, with the proofs of his guilt, which are ample. If these proofs
                  do not rid the government of one who is eternally holding sedition, then,
                  gentlemen, I shall lose all confidence in the laws of England, and that gallows
                  which punishes treason!"</p>
               <p>A grim and disdainful smile seemed to flit across the countenance of the stranger
                  as he and St. John exchanged glances. Then his fiery glance vailed itself, his
                  face grew cold again, and he fixed his eyes on the Governor.</p>
               <p>"But it was not my purpose, gentlemen," continued Lord Dunmore, with a severe air,
                  "to refer to these obscure and contemptible agents of treason. I designed calling
                  your attention to the fact that these seditious views are being so widely
                  disseminated that all classes of persons are becoming aroused by them. All proper
                  subservience to the government and myself; the very respect that is due to my
                  person, is refused in a manner most insulting and outrageous!"</p>
               <p>The stranger laid his hand on St. John's arm and said, in a low voice, "Now it 's
                  your turn, friend, but do n't move or speak—let us listen."</p>
               <p>The Governor, whose countenance slowly colored with anger as he spoke,
                  continued.</p>
               <p>"You know, gentlemen," he said, "to what I have reference—the scene that took
                  place at my palace some days since. You were, some of you, present, and you
                  witnessed the spectacle of a peer of the realm, and the representative of his
                  Majesty, insulted, outraged, and even menaced by a young man whose reply to my
                  just complaints of his remissness was a threat to plunge his sword into my breast.
                  If I have not brought this impudent person to justice, it is only because I have
                  been absorbed by affairs more important, but he is marked in my black book, and in
                  good time his sedition will be punished."</p>
               <p>"Listen," said the stranger, in his low, deep voice, and crouching with fiery
                  eyes, near the face of the young man, "listen—'<emph>affairs more
                     important!</emph>'—do you understand? Conolly!"</p>
               <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6146-00000110"/>
               <p>And the stranger's eyes seemed to blaze as he leaned forward, pointing to
                  Dunmore.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said St. John, coldly, "I understand!"</p>
               <p>The Governor paused a moment, then went on, loftily.</p>
               <p>"All these outrages and commotions," he said, "indicate, on the part of the people
                  of this colony, a tendency to tumult and rebellion. This tendency has entered the
                  House of Burgesses, and even appeared in that body some years ago. On that
                  occasion, their action compelled Lord Botetourt to dissolve them, an act which he,
                  however, performed in a manner extremely reprehensible. I say reprehensible, sirs,
                  and I know what I say! His lordship committed a great fault, and I shall take
                  warning from the result of his ill-advised proceeding."</p>
               <p>The Governor frowned as he spoke, and looked round the council haughtily.</p>
               <p>"In myself, gentlemen," he said, "his Majesty has a representative of another
                  description. I keep no terms with rebels, I utter no honeyed words; I suppress
                  their rebellions career, that is all. And this brings me, gentlemen, to the point
                  I would reach. The House of Burgesses, yesterday, proceeded to resolves upon the
                  late bill for the closing of Boston harbor—to resolves, in their spirit, if not in
                  letter, treasonable! Yes, treasonable!" said the Governor, scowling at the
                  council; "they have presumed to declare that this bill is a blow at the liberties
                  of America! The liberties! the very word is nonsense! I know what the tools of
                  sedition say about these 'liberties,' but I say that the best writers upon
                  constitutional law lay down the fixed principle that dependent colonies can have
                     <emph>no</emph> liberties. They are subject to Parliament and the King; it is
                  their place to submit, and I for one, gentlemen, will see that the government does
                  not yield to these impudent claims! Yes, impudent! You think the word too strong,
                  I do not! It is impudence, and nothing less, to declare that the government has no
                  right to close the port of Boston, for their overt act of sedition in destroying
                  the tea in December last! And the House of Burgesses is not content with declaring
                  this an attack on the liberties of America, forsooth! It must proceed further, and
                  appoint the first day of June a day of fasting, and humiliation, and prayer! Well,
                  gentlemen, I have but one word to add. The Burgesses, by their own action, declare
                  themselves desirous of being humiliated. They fix on the first day of June; I will
                  save them the trouble and delay by humiliating them now!"</p>
               <p>And with an angry flush upon his countenance, the Governor turned to the clerk of
                  the council and said, haughtily,</p>
               <p>"Bid the gentlemen Burgesses attend me in my council chamber!"</p>
               <p>The clerk bowed low, and left the apartment in the midst of profound silence on
                  the part of the council.</p>
               <p>"Look now and listen!" said the stranger, in a low voice, to St. John; "see how
                  this coarse little terrier will snarl at the lions of Virginia!"</p>
               <p>The usher returned and announced that the Burgesses were approaching.</p>
               <p>They soon made their appearance, headed by the speaker and the sergeant carrying
                  the great mace, defiling into the apartment with measured steps, and heads bent
                  with cold courtesy as they fronted the Governor.</p>
               <p>Lord Dunmore's eye, for a moment, quailed before the clear and calm gaze of these
                  men of lofty stature and erect port.</p>
               <p>He nervously arranged his papers as before, and cleared his throat. No doubt his
                  Excellency had designed to utter his views at length, and in a manner similar to
                  that already made use of to the council.</p>
               <p>But before the array of fearless countenances with their firm lips and cold eyes,
                  filled with a hauteur greater even than his own, this design seemed to be too
                  great a tax on his powers.</p>
               <p>He gazed for a moment with his former mixture of nervous trepidation and insulting
                  disdain at the body, and then,<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6146-00000111"/> raising
                  from the table a copy of the resolutions passed on the previous day, he said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Speaker, and gentlemen of the House of Burgesses, I have in my hand a paper,
                  published by order of your House, conceived in such terms as reflect highly upon
                  his Majesty and the Parliament of Great Britain, which makes it necessary to
                  dissolve you, and you are dissolved accordingly!"</p>
               <p>Having so spoken, the Governor, with an angry and swollen countenance, leaned back
                  in his chair, and gazed with a sort of fearful defiance upon the Burgesses.</p>
               <p>The speaker simply bowed, and then, followed by the members, left the apartment in
                  the same deliberate and measured manner.</p>
               <p>"Come, friend!" said the stranger to St. John, whom he drew away, "the first scene
                  is played, and the rest will rapidly follow!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XL.</head>
               <head type="sub">HOW HIS EXCELLENCY ASKED THE NAME OF THE STRANGER.</head>
               <p>THE two men soon found themselves again upon the portico of the capitol.</p>
               <p>The crowd, if any thing, had increased, and now seemed to have exchanged its
                  silence and gloom for indignation and uproar.</p>
               <p>The great waves rolled, and muttered, and dashed themselves about with somber
                  menace, and at times the long procession, so to speak, lining the whole of
                  Gloucester street, writhed to and fro, resembling, in the brilliant sunshine, a
                  great serpent with glittering scales, his body agitated and lustrous as that of
                  the cobra or the rattlesnake, when about to raise his crest and strike with his
                  fangs.</p>
               <p>This threatening air was obvious at once, and the stranger surveyed the huge mass
                  of heads with a species of gloomy satisfaction.</p>
               <p>"Good, good!" he said, in his deep voice, "the breath of the storm sweeps toward
                  us, the surface begins to foam!"</p>
               <p>"The people?" said St. John.</p>
               <p>"Yes, look! Do you see this great crowd—this crowd, made up of gray beards and
                  children, of matrons and maidens, of high and low, rich and poor? Well, friend, I
                  see in their faces the result of our labors, our toils, our long waiting! They
                  rise, they tremble! the billows begin to boil! you may see the 'white horses,' as
                  the poets say; wait! You will see the tenth wave before long!"</p>
               <p>As the stranger spoke, his brilliant and fiery eye embraced the whole spectacle,
                  and his body bent forward like that of the hunter, when he finds himself in the
                  presence of the lion at bay.</p>
               <p>"You say, the 'tenth wave,'" said St. John, gazing on the stranger's pale
                  countenance with its sparkling eyes.</p>
               <p>"Yes, the wave that will strike and overwhelm!"</p>
               <p>"Heaven grant it!"</p>
               <p>"That is the prayer of thousands night and morning—that this insolent armed
                  tyranny may be swept from the earth!"</p>
               <p>"Ah! armed! you refer to the guards?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, look, at them!"</p>
               <p>"They almost trample on the crowd. To think that I was once commander of these
                  men!"</p>
               <p>"You are free again, and see what you have gained!"</p>
               <p>At this moment the agitation of the crowd grew even greater, and the guards of his
                  Excellency were hemmed in on every side by the waves, from which issued
                  threatening murmurs.</p>
               <p>From their elevated position the two men had a full view of the scene, and
                  especially of Mr. Lindon, whose tall form, on his large horse, rose above the
                  press.</p>
               <p>Lindon's countenance wore a mingled expression of fear and defiance, of anxiety
                  and supercilious disdain,</p>
               <p>He seemed to regard the crowd with the impatience and<pb n="222-223"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000112"/> scorn of a nobleman, in presence of a rebellious
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">canaille,</foreign> but a <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >canaille</foreign> which it was good policy not to arouse.</p>
               <p>His horse, however, was restive, and the heavy spurs which his rider unconsciously
                  dug into his sides at times, excited him more and more. The result of the last
                  application of the sharp rowels, was a furious bound of the animal, and an old
                  man, with hoary head and beard, was struck heavily and fell.</p>
               <p>In an instant the crowd was driven to frenzy, and with furious countenances, they
                  were about to throw themselves upon the troops, when a loud noise from the portico
                  attracted every one's attention.</p>
               <p>It was his Excellency, who had adjourned the council and now descended to his
                  carriage.</p>
               <p>"What is the meaning of this uproar?" he said, sternly; "are my people being
                  attacked by these insurgents?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my lord," cried Lindon, "the masses here are in commotion!"</p>
               <p>And he struck at the hand of a tall fellow who caught at his bridle.</p>
               <p>The Governor saw the threat of the man, and his face grew pale.</p>
               <p>"If they attack you, charge and disperse them!" he said, pale and fearful amid all
                  his anger.</p>
               <p>Lindon hesitated.</p>
               <p>The furious faces and menacing arms intimidated the worthy commander.</p>
               <p>"I say charge them!" cried the Governor.</p>
               <p>The words were distinctly heard by the crowd, and a howl of rage was the
                  reply.</p>
               <p>The women and children were hastily hurried to the rear, the men with strong arms
                  appeared all at once in front, in an immovable phalanx, and the hands of these
                  men, whose faces were pale and determined, were inserted into the pockets of their
                  doublets, grasping concealed arms there.</p>
               <p>In a moment a sanguinary contest would have ensued, and the streets flowed with
                  blood.</p>
               <p>But a more commanding voice than that of his Excellency rung above the heads of
                  the crowd, and drew all eyes to the speaker.</p>
               <p>It was the voice of the stranger, and it resounded like the blast of a trumpet
                  above the roar of shouts and menaces.</p>
               <p>The words which he uttered were brief, fiery, and to the point. He counseled
                  moderation—the moment had not come. The men before them were a handfull only,
                  which a breath would scatter, but no advantage would be gained by dispersing
                  them.</p>
               <p>"Let them pass!" he said in his sonorous voice, which rang above the menacing
                  multitude like a clarion; "the hour has not struck! Wait! it comes!"</p>
               <p>"And you, my lord," added the stranger, advancing with his head raised proudly
                  erect toward Dunmore, "do not lash this people into madness! 'T is sound counsel!
                  Return to your palace before it is too late, sir! In ten minutes your path will be
                  barred by the crowd, and at a word the streets of the capital will flow with
                  blood! I give you good advice, and advise you to profit by it. Return, I say,
                  while you have time!"</p>
               <p>The Governor trembled with rage, and glared at the speaker for an instant without
                  speaking.</p>
               <p>"And who are you, sir?" he said, with an explosion; "who are you that give advice
                  to a peer of the realm, and the representative of his Majesty?"</p>
               <p>"A man of the people only, my lord."</p>
               <p>"Your name, sir! I desire to remember it!"</p>
               <p>A cloud passed over the stranger's brow, and his eyes flashed.</p>
               <p>"It is a name that is not pleasant to your lordship!" he said, haughtily, "a
                  circumstance which I do not regret!"</p>
               <p>"Your name, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Waters!" replied the stranger, returning the Governor's frown with a glance of
                  fire which showed to what depths his nature was moved. "Waters is my name, and I
                  am the father of the child whom your lordship, with a coarseness<pb n="224-225"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000113"/> and cruelty only worthy of a peer of the realm,
                  outraged and wounded in your palace! I scorn to conceal any thing! If your
                  lordship presumes to order my arrest, I will arouse that crowd to tear you and
                  your escort to pieces!"</p>
               <p>Carried away for the moment by rage and scorn, the speaker advanced another step
                  toward the Governor, and confronted him with a look of such decision and fire,
                  that Dunmore's cheek grew pale, and his lips vainly endeavored to shape an
                  answer.</p>
               <p>"Your lordship will doubtless have all your hounds on my track to-morrow!" said
                  the stranger, "but I will defend myself now and at all times! If you arrest me, it
                  will be my dead body!"</p>
               <p>The Governor had not time to utter a word in reply to this speech, before the
                  portico suddenly filled with the members of the House of Burgesses.</p>
               <p>At sight of them the crowd uttered a shout, or rather a roar, indicating a perfect
                  knowledge of their ignominious dismissal.</p>
               <p>The menacing waves rushed again toward the troop, and the six horses, drawing the
                  chariot of his Excellency, tossed their heads and moved about in their harnesses
                  with fright.</p>
               <p>"My lord," said the speaker of the Burgesses, "permit me to respectfully suggest
                  your return to the palace. The people assembled here evidently construe your
                  dissolution of the Burgesses into an insult and outrage, and we can not be
                  responsible for the consequences of the further presence of the troops!"</p>
               <p>Dunmore, boiling with rage, and pale with fear, surveyed, alternately, the
                  Burgesses and the roaring crowd.</p>
               <p>The people were more completely aroused than ever; Lindon's eyes turned, from
                  moment to moment, uneasily toward the Governor.</p>
               <p>"My lord!" said the speaker, "in the name of Heaven, either return or dismiss your
                  troops! In ten minutes blood will flow!"</p>
               <p>Dunmore, with a convulsion of wrath, but a step wavering and undecided, half
                  descended the flight of steps.</p>
               <p>"Go on, my lord," said the speaker, "we will attend you and restrain any commotion
                  of the inhabitants. I beseech your lordship to proceed!"</p>
               <p>Lord Dunmore half turned, with a countenance red and pale with rapid changing
                  expressions, and for an instant his wrathful glance rested upon the face of the
                  stranger.</p>
               <p>He ground his teeth audibly, and shaking his glove toward his enemy, turned and
                  descended the steps.</p>
               <p>The members of the Burgesses surrounded him, and mixing with the crowd, spoke
                  earnestly and reproachfully to them.</p>
               <p>The justice of these representations seemed to be acknowledged, and the sea of
                  heads flowed backward toward the houses on each side of the way, leaving an open
                  space, through which the troops, headed by Lindon and the chariot containing the
                  Governor, rapidly advanced towards the palace.</p>
               <p>The Burgesses continued to escort it until it disappeared at the turn of the
                  street, and then they mixed with the crowd, in whose tumultuous and agitated waves
                  they were swallowed up and lost.</p>

               <p>ONE member of the Burgesses remained on the portico of the capitol.</p>
               <p>It was the awkward-looking man in the tie-wig, the peach-blossom coat, and old red
                     cloak.<ref rend="super" target="#note_029" xml:id="return_029">*</ref>

               </note>
               <p>Leaning against a pillar, with his shoulders bent, a pair of old saddle-bags,
                  containing papers, on his arm, his iron<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6146-00000114"/>
                  mouth wreathed with a cold, grim smile, the man in the red cloak gazed after the
                  retreating chariot and its escort.</p>
               <p>He then rose erect, and laying his hand on the arm of the stranger, said, in a
                  voice at once harsh and musical, careless and earnest,</p>
               <p>"Well, brother patriot! that 's a handsome spectacle, is it not now?"</p>
               <p>The stranger was silent for some minutes, during which time he seemed to be
                  engaged in suppressing the last mutterings of the storm of wrath which had clouded
                  his mind.</p>
               <p>One after one his features sank into rest, the old iron calmness again diffused
                  itself over his countenance, and he replied,</p>
               <p>"I know not, friend, if it is a handsome sight, but I think it a very fair
                  exhibition of aped and mimiced royalty."</p>
               <p>"Well, you see, his Excellency's king here—we can't complain."</p>
               <p>"Yes, king! by right of arms."</p>
               <p>"I do n't think you treated royalty with sufficient respect," said the man in the
                  red cloak, smiling grimly; "he'll take his revenge and arrest you."</p>
               <p>"My dead body, perhaps."</p>
               <p>"Good! good!" said the grim speaker; "that 's the way I like to hear people talk!
                  That 's the true lingo! I know you are in earnest, and are ready."</p>
               <p>"I am," said the stranger.</p>
               <p>"Beware of your movements—watch! guard yourself. For you have a cunning and
                  treacherous enemy to deal with, a man who absolutely disgusts and revolts me!"</p>
               <p>And the countenance of the man in the red cloak lost its grim carelessness, and
                  his eyes flashed.</p>
               <p>"Brother!" he said, proudly raising his head, "I think we 're beginning to reap!
                  Do you remember our talks at the <emph>Raleigh</emph> ten years ago? I then
                  affected to teach you; I was really learning. I was wrong, you were right! It was
                  necessary to advance step by step; 'from doubt to certainty, from certainty to
                  indignation, from indignation to revolution!' Those were your very words, and they
                  have been the iron bit, the chain bridle which curbed my natural impetuosity and
                  recklessness. I would have shot on, like a war-horse, and you held me in. I would
                  have rushed head-long, your mind held me back! Yes, you were the true thinker,
                  marching, step by step, with the times, neither in advance or behind. Do not deny
                  it," continued the man in the red cloak, gazing with a proud look upon the
                  stranger, which seemed to illumine his countenance, and rendered it most
                  attractive; "do not say no, for I speak the truth of your genius! You saw further
                  and deeper than I did, and history is your vindication. Well, now, we have truly
                  gone from doubt and certainty to indignation, and the end will be the fires of
                  revolution, as you predicted."</p>
               <p>"Yes, friend!" said the speaker, raising his head still more nobly, and with
                  glowing eyes, "you were right, a thousand times right, and yet ten years ago we
                  really inaugurated this revolution. Can your memory ever lose that scene which I
                  refer to? I see that you remember; that you can not forget the burning stamps, the
                  great crowd, the roaring of that thunder, and the dazzling bolt which crashed down
                  in a blaze like the light of the eyes of the Almighty! But you did not hear my
                  words then, there on that platform, above the roaring fire, for you were lifeless,
                  your mouth full of bloody foam! Brother! I received you as you fell back in my
                  arms on my breast! I clasped your weak form to my heart as a mother clasps her
                  child. Do you know what I said after what you uttered then? I said, 'The
                  revolution is begun!' and it was! To-day it only goes on, you see! and it 's no
                  new acquaintance to us at least!"</p>
               <p>The man in the red cloak had completely lost his carelessness, as he spoke in
                  animated and nervous tones, and his earnest eyes dwelt with proud admiration on
                  the stranger.</p>
               <p>"There 's the hand I gave you ten years ago," he said, "the hand of a loyal man! I
                  then said to you that the new world dawned; I now add that the sun mounts,
                     through<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6146-00000115"/> clouds and mists, to its
                  zenith. Remember! to-morrow, in the Raleigh, you know! The association is already
                  drawn up."</p>
               <p>And, retiring as it were into himself, again the man in the red cloak led the way
                  down the steps, with a careless and shambling gait, which was the perfection of
                  awkwardness.</p>
               <p>St. John gazed after him with thoughtful eyes, and asked himself if this man
                  really could be the thunderbolt of oratory, the genius of the rising storm.</p>
               <p>The voice of the stranger recalled him to himself.</p>
               <p>"I see what you are thinking of, friend," he said, in his habitual tone of
                  calmness; "you doubt whether this man is equal to the work assigned to him; you
                  question the sublimity of that strength I have claimed for him. Well let us not
                  further discuss the matter. Let us wait, and perhaps we shall hear his voice. Let
                  us follow the current of events, and see their course. Virginia is every moment
                  now making history!"</p>
               <p>The stranger then descended the steps, followed by St. John, and they both
                  disappeared in the crowd.</p>
               <p>There were two personages present at these stormy scenes whom neither the young
                  man nor the stranger had noticed.</p>
               <p>The first was a child who, mounted upon the pedestal of Lord Botetourt's statue,
                  with one white arm clasped round that worthy nobleman's knee, had followed, with
                  flushed cheeks and fearful eyes, the details of the tumult.</p>
               <p>She was clad in a little pink dress, with scarlet silk stockings, which ended in
                  rosetted shoes, and one of these shoes was firmly planted on the pedestal of the
                  statue. The child kneeled with the other knee on the shoulder of a youthful
                  cavalier, on whose curly head she rested her left hand for further security, and
                  the boy seemed to be proud of his burden.</p>
               <p>As the stranger and St. John disappeared, the girl slid down from the statue, was
                  caught gallantly in the arms of her escort, and they wandered away—the boy's arm
                  round the neck of the child, and her own resting innocently on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>As they were lost in the crowd the girl said,</p>
               <p>"Oh me, Paul! did n't it scare you?"</p>
               <p>"No!" replied Paul; "no, Blossom! You see, you are a girl; I am a man, and I want
                  to fight!"</p>
               <p>He did so, in the Revolution.</p>

               <p>IT was the morning of the 27th of May, 1774, a day which, like the 22d of
                  February, 1732, and the 4th of July, 1776, belongs to history.</p>
               <p>As before, the sun rose, bright and serene, through a cloudless heaven, and at ten
                  o'clock the members of the late House of Burgesses met in the "Apollo" room of the
                  Raleigh tavern. On the same evening, the ball given by the Burgesses, in honor of
                  Lady Dunmore, was to be held at the capitol.<ref rend="super" target="#note_030"

               <p>Our brethren of other States have carefully collected the dates of revolutionary
                  occurrences, at this period, when so many colonies were jostling each other, as it
                  were, in the noble struggle for precedence in bidding defiance to the oppression
                  of the home government. For this reason we rigidly adhere to history in narrating
                  events at Williamsburg.</p>
               <p>It was at four in the evening, on the 26th of May, 1774, that the Virginia House
                  of Burgesses were dissolved for their action on the bill closing Boston harbor. It
                  was at ten in the<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6146-00000116"/> morning, on the 27th
                  of May, the next day, that they met in the Raleigh tavern to enter their solemn
                  protest against the act of the Governor, and send their words of cheer to their
                  brethren. It was at nine o'clock at night, on the same evening, that the Burgesses
                  and gentlemen of Virginia met to honor with splendid entertainment the wife and
                  daughters of Lord Dunmore.</p>
               <p>It was an act very characteristic of the men of Virginia—those courtly gentlemen
                  whose portraits we now gaze on with so much affection and admiration. They bowed
                  low to Lord Dunmore on that evening; but it was the bow of the swordsman, who
                  salutes his adversary as he places himself on guard.</p>
               <p>The "Apollo" room was a plain apartment, with whitewashed walls, numerous windows,
                  and a pine wainscotting, painted lead color, running around the whole extent of
                  the room.</p>
               <p>A door at one end afforded entrance, and at the other end an old-fashioned
                  fire-place was flanked by two other doors, leading by winding stair-cases to the
                  dormitories above.</p>
               <p>A long table and a number of benches and chairs, hastily provided, were the sole
                  furniture of the apartment when the Burgesses assembled.</p>
               <p>Our chronicle aims rather to give colors and social peculiarities than public
                  events, and in preceding pages we have endeavored to trace some of the traits of
                  the period, and to exhibit the effect, in a social point of view, of those events
                  upon the minds especially of men leading that remote country life, where the true
                  character of movements and things is caught more vividly and accurately, perhaps,
                  than in other localities. We have shown how the intelligence of the Boston Port
                  bill was received at Vanely, and we have just witnessed the scenes which attended
                  the resolves of the Burgesses on the same subject.</p>
               <p>We shall, therefore, leave to the imagination of the reader the meeting at the
                  Raleigh of those true and noble patriots—leave, also, to imagination, the
                  countenances and words of those men who did so much for their descendants; who, in
                  the long galleries of history, will hang the noblest pictures, the heroes, of the
                  dark and stormy days of our Revolution. For him who writes, there seems ever to
                  rest upon those splendid figures and imperial brows a richer splendor than we see
                  to-day—the glory and beauty of a purer patriotism, and a more serene and
                  changeless devotion to the cause of truth and the happiness of their species. They
                  were true as steel amid the fury of the storm, and sent their great voices to
                  their brethren without fear.<ref rend="super" target="#note_031"

               </p>
               <p>Of this body of men who threw down the gauntlet to a wicked oppression, pledging
                  life and fortune, and sacred honor in the struggle; of these men who met at the
                  old Raleigh, Virginia will ever be proud. Not a head but is dear to her still, for
                  there is not a name but is an echo of truth and courage, and devotion to a noble
                  cause.</p>
               <p>The meeting in the "Apollo" room soon terminated.</p>
               <p>Its deliberations had been marked by the utmost calmness, the most immovable
                  decision, and a dignity and moderation which gave its action the effect of a
                  decree emanating from the flower of the patriotism and strength of the colony.</p>
               <p>The convention had agreed upon a proclamation to the people of Virginia, headed,
                  "An Association signed by eighty-nine members of the late House of Burgesses."</p>
               <p>It declared that the Burgesses, "having been deprived, by the sudden interposition
                  of the executive part of the government, from giving their countrymen the advice
                  they wished to convey to them in a legislative capacity, they found themselves
                  under the hard necessity of adopting this, the only method they had left, of
                  pointing out to their countrymen such measures as in their opinion were best
                  fitted to secure their dear rights and liberty from destruction, by the heavy hand
                  of power now lifted against North America."</p>
               <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6146-00000117"/>
               <p>The paper went on to declare that the application of the colonies to Great Britain
                  for justice had been disregarded; that a determined system was being pressed to
                  reduce them to slavery, by taxing them without representation, and that the Boston
                  Harbor bill was unconstitutional and "most violent and arbitrary"—a "dangerous
                  attempt to destroy the liberties of America." That tea should be used by no person
                  wishing well to his country, and that no other East India Company commodity
                  whatsoever, but absolute necessaries, should be purchased or used.</p>
               <p>"We are further clearly of opinion," said the paper, "that an attack made on one
                  of our sister colonies, to compel submission to arbitrary taxes, is an attack made
                  on all British America, and threatens ruin to the rights of all, unless the united
                  wisdom of the whole be applied. And for this purpose it is recommended to the
                  committee of correspondence, that they communicate with their several
                  corresponding committees, on the expediency of appointing deputies from the
                  several colonies of British America, to meet in general congress at such place,
                  annually, as shall be thought most convenient; there to deliberate on those
                  general measures which the united interests of America may, from time to time,
                  require."</p>
               <p>The paper ended by declaring that a persistence in the designs of Parliament would
                  produce an "end of all commercial intercourse with Great Britain," and then were
                  affixed the signatures of the eighty-nine Burgesses.</p>
               <p>Thus, in this paper, the members of the late House of Burgesses:</p>
               <p>I. Protested against their arbitrary dissolution by Lord Dunmore.</p>
               <p>II. Declared the Boston Port bill unconstitutional, and a blow at the liberties of
                  the North American provinces.</p>
               <p>III. That they and their countrymen would use no tea or other English commodities
                  until the act was repealed.</p>
               <p>IV. That an attack on the sister province of Massachusetts was regarded as an
                  attack upon Virginia.</p>
               <p>V. That persistence in these measures would terminate all intercourse with Great
                  Britain.</p>
               <p>VI. That steps should at once be taken for a general congress to meet annually,
                  and deliberate on such measures as the united interests of the country at large
                  might demand.</p>
               <p>Thus the Burgesses of Virginia accurately and clearly <emph>defined</emph> the
                  oppressions of England, and proclaimed the rights of the people of North America.
                  They declared common cause with the sister colonies, and pointed out the strength
                  to be derived from union. Thus Virginia was at her post, as always, in the van of
                  the great army of resistance. All eyes were directed toward her, and her voice of
                  good cheer was heard through the gathering storm, as her sisters had heard it in
                  the past.<ref rend="super" target="#note_032" xml:id="return_032">*</ref>

               <p>In the burning oratory of Patrick Henry in '65, the gauntlet was thrown down to
                  the originators of the Stamp Act.</p>
               <p>In the protests of the Burgesses in '74, the issue was joined on the Boston Port
                  bill.</p>
               <p>The hot metal, for nine years, growing hotter and hotter in the cauldron, was thus
                  poured into the mould of revolution.</p>

               <head type="sub">IN WHICH A CHARIOT ARRIVES.</head>
               <p>"WELL friend," said the stranger, issuing forth with St. John from the Apollo
                  chamber of the "Raleigh," "you see the game's afoot! the leashes are loosed, and
                  the dogs of war bay on the track!"</p>
               <p>"Your prophecies rush to their fulfillment truly!"</p>
               <p>"They were not such—they were mere announcements. And now, friend, I must go. My
                  work calls me. Events<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6146-00000118"/> tread on each
                  other's heels, and minutes grow to days. I have told you where to find me, if you
                  wish, in the capital."</p>
               <p>And saluting his companion, the stranger turned away and was lost in the depths of
                  the crowd.</p>
               <p>St. John returned slowly to his lodgings, and sitting down, remained for a long
                  time buried in thought. In the two days which had just elapsed he had received so
                  many new and vivid impressions that he needed silence and reflection. He had heard
                  the moving accents of a mysterious agent of revolution; he had seen the
                  representatives of the people defy the authority of the government; he felt the
                  ground shake beneath him as it were, with the tramp of a nation slowly advancing
                  toward the gulf of war.</p>
               <p>On that other more painful event of recent hours, he tried not to let his mind
                  dwell. At first he succeeded, but soon his resolution succumbed, and, with a
                  bitter sigh, he went over every detail of his misfortune.</p>
               <p>"Well, well," he said at length, rising, "let the dead days bury the dead, I'll
                  not touch the corpse. I'll not whine and moan, let what will come! Patience! 't is
                  all in a lifetime!"</p>
               <p>And going to the window, he gazed sorrowfully into the street. As he did so, a
                  chariot stopped before the door of the large house opposite, the residence of his
                  friend, Mr. Burwell. He started as he saw Bonnybel issue from it. She was followed
                  by the gouty old colonel and the rest of the family, and the great traveling
                  trunks, containing doubtless the ball costumes of the ladies, having been removed,
                  old Cato whipped up his four long-tailed horses, and the chariot drove to the
                  stables.</p>
               <p>The visitors were received at the door by Mr. Burwell; a beautiful young lady,
                  with sunny curls, embraced and kissed Bonnybel; it was she whom the girl called
                  "Bellebouche"—and the door closed upon the party.</p>
               <p>St. John returned to his sofa and his reflections. They busied themselves with the
                  query whether he should attend the assembly. At last he seemed to have made up his
                  mind.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I'll go," he muttered, "and not act the part of the Knight of the Forlorn
                  Countenance! I'll go dance, and laugh, and be as hypocritical as the best of them.
                  What a world it would be if every luckless fellow turned hermit! if every heavy
                  heart did not mask its anguish with a laugh!"</p>
               <p>And looking with a sardonic smile at a picture resembling Bonnybel, which hung on
                  the wall, he added:</p>
               <p>"The fallen salutes his victor!"</p>

               <head type="sub">THE ASSEMBLY AT THE CAPITOL.</head>
               <p>NIGHT had fallen, brilliant with stars. The streets of the capital resounded
                  ceaselessly with the roll of chariots. A laughing throng rushed, with merriment
                  and confusion, toward the center of attraction—the old capitol, where the ball was
                  held.</p>
               <p>A procession of splendid equipages constantly deposited their burdens before the
                  portico. These burdens were pompous old planters in rich dark doublets, powdered
                  heads, kneebreeches, and silk stockings; grand old dames in black silks and
                  diamonds, and laughing little maidens, who flashed forth like butterflies in their
                  immense hooped dresses of glittering satin, with jewels and laces, and curls and
                  smiles, the latter directed at the gay gallants who received them.</p>
               <p>The youngsters in question did not come in the family chariots. They preferred, to
                  that "slow" mode of conveyance, the saddles of their thorough-breds. On their fine
                  prancing horses they had galloped by the coaches, uttering a hundred jests, and
                  exhibiting their graces to Dulcinea within, and they now stood prepared to lead in
                  the ladies.</p>
               <p>Let us leave the scenes of hubbub at the door, and enter the assembly room.</p>
               <p>It is filled with the laughter of revelers. A great crowd,<pb n="236-237"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000119"/> undulating to and fro beneath the brilliant lamps,
                  is constantly increased by new arrivals. From end to end of the great room, runs a
                  buzz of voices, which rises at times to a deafening din, and when the sable
                  musicians in the corner scrape their catgut, a thrill of delight runs through the
                  young men and maidens. Silks and satins rustle and whistle, like the broad leaves
                  of corn when a breeze passes over them; the bright eyes of the ladies summon their
                  partners for the quadrille and the minuet.</p>
               <p>From his post in a corner, St. John sees Colonel Vane and his family enter. The
                  colonel limps, leaning on his gold-headed cane, erect Aunt Mabel at his side.
                  Behind comes Miss Seraphina with her friend, Mr. John Hamilton; Tom Alston escorts
                  Helen; and lastly Miss Bonnybel appears on the arm of Barry Hunter, the Prince of
                  the Wilderness. St. John does not look at Mr. Burwell's party, he gazes calmly at
                  Bonnybel.</p>
               <p>She is clad in a dress of gauze-like fabric, over a petticoat of azure satin. A
                  mass of lace envelopes her beautiful arms, and she looks as fresh as a rose. Her
                  hair, profusely powdered and looped with pearls, is carried back from her white
                  forehead; her violet eyes sparkle with anticipation.</p>
               <p>The dark brunette complexion, black hair, and calm face of the gentleman who comes
                  and salutes her, present a decided contrast to the maiden.</p>
               <p>It is Mr. St. John, who approaches in the most courteous way, and pays his
                  respects to the party. A slight color comes to the girl's cheek as he bows, and
                  she holds out her hand and presses his own warmly. The pressure is not returned,
                  and St. John, bowing low, makes way for the gentlemen who hasten to pay their
                  respects to the little beauty.</p>
               <p>All at once the brilliant crowd is seen to divide. Lord Dunmore, in a costume of
                  immense splendor, enters. His squat little figure is covered with embroidery and
                  decorations. His countenance wears an elaborate smile, but his eyes do not smile
                  at all, they glitter, so to speak, on the assembly.</p>
               <p>The ladies, however—the countess and her daughters—seem unaffectedly pleased.
                  Innumerable presentations commence then, and these are succeeded by a minuet, in
                  which the countess is led forth by Mr. Randolph, of the council.</p>
               <p>The festivities of the evening are thus formally inaugurated, and thenceforth the
                  assembly commences in earnest. Quadrilles, contra-dances, minuets succeed each
                  other; the joy and mirth of the ball begins to culminate. The apartment trembles
                  and quakes with the flood of voices, the floors jar with the feet of the dancers
                  as they move, as they move to the loud music, which rejoices and triumphs in its
                  sway over gallants and dames.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE RIVAL LIEUTENANTS OF THE GUARDS.</head>
               <p>"ARE you angry with me, cousin?"</p>
               <p>St. John, who was talking with his friend, Mr. Hamilton, felt a hand on his arm
                  from behind. He started, and turning, saw Bonnybel leaning on the arm of a
                  gentleman.</p>
               <p>There was a color in her cheeks, and something like a pout upon her lips, but the
                  eyes of the young lady were very sad as she gazed at St. John.</p>
               <p>"Angry?" he said recovering from his momentary surprise; "by no means; why should
                  you think so?"</p>
               <p>"Because you've scarce saluted me, and not asked me to dance."</p>
               <p>And Miss Bonnybel pouted again.</p>
               <p>"I am not very gay this evening," replied the young man. "I spare your feelings,
                  for I should doubtless weary you."</p>
               <p>"You are very cold!" she murmured, in a tone which he alone caught, "you look at
                  me as though I were the most indifferent person in the world to you."</p>
               <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6146-00000120"/>
               <p>And the large sad eyes dwelt pensively upon his countenance.</p>
               <p>His pulse throbbed, but that was all. He did not speak.</p>
               <p>"You forget that long ago, you engaged my hand for a minuet," she continued,
                  coloring, "but, doubtless, you have not thought of me or the engagement."</p>
               <p>"On the contrary, I was coming to claim your hand for the next. Will you dance
                  with me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," she said.</p>
               <p>The embarrassing conversation was interrupted by the appearance of Mr. Lindon,
                  who, in his splendid uniform of lieutenant of the guards, came and saluted,
                  profoundly, the young lady.</p>
               <p>"May I have the honor of dancing the next minuet with you, madame?" he said.</p>
               <p>"I have just engaged myself to my cousin, Mr. St. John, sir," she replied,
                  coldly.</p>
               <p>The two men looked at each other with that expression which indicates concealed
                  hostility, and bowed low.</p>
               <p>"Then I trust I may have the pleasure of presenting Miss Vane to the countess and
                  his Excellency," continued Lindon.</p>
               <p>"Pray excuse me, sir. I propose going up with my father."</p>
               <p>Lindon's head rose proudly.</p>
               <p>"I am unfortunate in my requests," he said, "but at least I may hope to secure
                  Miss Vane's hand for the next quadrille."</p>
               <p>"I am engaged, sir."</p>
               <p>"For the next, then."</p>
               <p>"It is very fatiguing."</p>
               <p>Lindon's face colored with anger, and with a haughty toss of the head, he
                  said,</p>
               <p>"I regret that Miss Vane should regard me with personal dislike."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry I have offended you, sir; it gives me no pleasure to wound any one's
                  feelings."</p>
               <p>"Miss Vane's theory and practice slightly differ."</p>
               <p>St. John had been chafing for some moments at Lindon's tone. He now raised his
                  finger, coldly, and said,</p>
               <p>"You must be aware, sir, that this conversation is disagreeable to Miss Vane. I
                  insist on its terminating at once."</p>
               <p>The flush of anger deepened upon Lindon's face, and he was about to reply, when
                  the musicians struck up a minuet. Bonnybel hastily took her cousin's arm, and led
                  him to the dance. In all their movements they were followed by the glittering and
                  sinister eyes of Lindon, and the expression of his face indicated profound
                  rage.</p>
               <p>But this rage was destined to be further increased.</p>
               <p>As the minuet ended, a sudden burst of laughter, at the door of the apartment,
                  attracted the attention of every one, and all eyes were turned upon Lindon.</p>
               <p>"Pray what 's the jest yonder, Captain Waters?" said St. John to that gentleman
                  who stood near; "something seems to amuse the company."</p>
               <p>"Ah, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">farceur!</foreign>" cried the captain, twirling his
                  huge mustache, and making a low salute to Bonnybel, "do you deny that you are the
                  originator of this comedy—this excellent, admirable comedy?"</p>
               <p>"Comedy?"</p>
               <p>"Farce! harlequinade! what you please!" cried the captain, laughing, "and see if
                  my opinion is not that of all!"</p>
               <p>As he spoke, all eyes were turned upon St. John. The young man's brows contracted,
                  and desiring that Bonnybel might not share this strange publicity, he surrendered
                  her to the protection of the other.</p>
               <p>"Right! right!" said the captain, shaking with laughter; "search! investigate!
                  find out, my dear fellow!"</p>
               <p>"I certainly shall."</p>
               <p>And pushing through the crowd, St. John gained the door of the apartment. He
                  stopped suddenly.</p>
               <p>In the door of the ball-room, with the serene air of one who considers himself
                  worth looking at, stood St. John's<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6146-00000121"/>
                  servant, Julius. The negro wore a uniform exactly similiar to Mr. Lindon's. It had
                  been tossed to him scornfully by his master, after the scene at the palace, and
                  Julius now donned it for the purpose of shining in the eyes of his fellow
                  servants.</p>
               <p>Attracted to the door of the ball-room by his natural love for sight-seeing,
                  Julius had been seen by the company, and as neither Mr. Lindon nor the guards were
                  very popular, the sight had been greeted with uproarious laughter.</p>
               <p>St. John could not repress a grim smile at the superb attitude of Julius, but this
                  instantly gave way to displeasure. He advanced with a gathering frown, and the
                  first intimation which the sable gentleman had of the presence of his master, was
                  the vigorous application of the flat of a dress sword to his shoulders.</p>
               <p>"Go and take off that suit this instant, rascal!" said St. John. "Go!"</p>
               <p>Julius disappeared. He did not utter a word, or walk, or run, he vanished, amid a
                  peal of laughter.</p>
               <p>St. John immediately sought with his eye for Mr. Lindon; his intention being to
                  make that gentleman an explanation and apology. He saw his rival glaring at him
                  with a face pale with rage, but the crowd separated them. St. John was borne to
                  the side of Lord Dunmore.</p>
               <p>"Pray, what was the occasion of that laughter?" his lordship was saying to a
                  gentleman near at hand.</p>
               <p>"A strange spectacle, my lord," was the reply; "'t was a negro clad precisely like
                  the lieutenant of the guards, in a laced uniform, with epaulettes."</p>
               <p>"Are you jesting, sir?" cried Dunmore, with flashing eyes; "the costume of Mr.
                  Lindon?"</p>
               <p>"Precisely, my lord."</p>
               <p>Dunmore's face flushed with wrath, and the black vein swelled.</p>
               <p>"Whence this impudent outrage?" he cried; "answer me, gentlemen! Who will explain
                  this base insult to myself and my authority?"</p>
               <p>"I will, my lord," said St. John, approaching and bowing. "I regret to say that
                     <emph>I</emph> am the cause of the outrage."</p>
               <p>"Ah you!—you, Mr. St. John!" cried the Governor, glaring on the young man, almost
                  speechless with rage; "<emph>you</emph> again cross my path!"</p>
               <p>"My lord, I did not come to be insulted, but to explain. If you permit me, I can
                  do so very briefly."</p>
               <p>And seeing that the Governor's wrath was too great for him to speak, he added:</p>
               <p>"The explanation is simple. Having resigned my commission in your lordship's
                  service, I had no further use for my uniform, and my servant fell heir to it, in
                  common with all others which I decide to wear no longer. He has donned the suit
                  to-night, from a childish desire, no doubt, to excite admiration. I need scarcely
                  say that his intention was unknown to me, and to-morrow I shall punish him. I am
                  sorry that I even <emph>seem</emph> to have any agency in so stupid and ill-bred a
                  jest, and shall explain to Mr. Lindon, and entreat his pardon."</p>
               <p>The young man bowed low as he ended, and left Lord Dunmore as he uttered a hoarse
                  growl of anger.</p>
               <p>At the same moment, supper was announced, and this important event proved a
                  complete diversion to the company from the enjoyment of the farce. But it
                  continued to be food for laughter long afterward.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XLVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE SECRETARY.</head>
               <p>FOR a time, nothing was now heard but the rattle of plates and glasses, the crying
                  of toasts, the buzz and laughter, which accompanied the process of doing honor to
                  the profuse supper.</p>
               <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6146-00000122"/>
               <p>Then the ladies were conducted back to the ball-room, the music recommenced, and
                  the assembly, interrupted only for the moment, went on its way again in triumph.
                  In those times, a company did not separate because so slight a circumstance as the
                  sounding of midnight occurred, and the dancing began more gayly than ever.</p>
               <p>St. John was standing listlessly looking on, when Captain Waters drew his arm into
                  his own, and suggested the propriety of a glass or a dozen of Canary.</p>
               <p>"The fact is," said the captain, as they went toward the supper room, "my wife 's
                  not here, and I feel like a jolly bachelor. To let you into a secret, my dear St.
                  John, Madam Henriette 's a terrible personage, and makes me behave myself. But who
                  goes yonder?"</p>
               <p>"Where?"</p>
               <p>"There! Why it 's Foy! Good evening, comrade!"</p>
               <p>And the captain made a sign to the secretary, who, pale and calm as usual, was
                  gliding among the revelers. He stopped, and returned the greeting of the soldier
                  with calm courtesy.</p>
               <p>"Why, I 'm delighted to see you," said the captain; "labors over for the day?"</p>
               <p>"My labors, captain? Good evening, Mr. St. John."</p>
               <p>St. John bowed courteously.</p>
               <p>"Yes, your writing," said the soldier; "it must be terribly trying, this thing of
                  copying all the Governor's proclamations."</p>
               <p>The secretary's keen eye rested steadily for a moment upon the face of his
                  interlocutor, and then was withdrawn.</p>
               <p>"My work is indeed sometimes very exhausting, sir," he said.</p>
               <p>"See there!" cried the captain, with an innocent air; "I said so!"</p>
               <p>"You said, captain?"</p>
               <p>"Why, that this <emph>civil</emph> life was terribly wearisome!"</p>
               <p>The secretary inclined his head.</p>
               <p>"And to think that you would n't believe me, my dear Foy, when I told you that our
                  old adventures were far more attractive and amusing!"</p>
               <p>"They were truly very enticing to young men, as we then were."</p>
               <p>"Reinfels and all, comrade!"</p>
               <p>"Ah! that was a misfortune, sir," said Foy, courteously.</p>
               <p>"A misfortune! <foreign xml:lang="FRA">morbleu,</foreign> comrade, 't was no such
                  thing. It was a splendid adventure, and you rose, in my opinion, immensely after
                  that scene. I repeat, my dear Foy, that I positively adored you for that
                  blow!"</p>
               <p>The secretary again made his deprecating wave of the hand.</p>
               <p>"Come! no disclaimers! no modest expression, as of a young lady, who says,
                  sweetly, 'You take me very much by surprise, sir—really—la!' I say, comrade, 't
                  was a great blow, this <hi rend="i"/>coup of Reinfels, as I call it! Do n't deny
                  it!"</p>
               <p>"You are very flattering, captain."</p>
               <p>"Not at all, comrade; I 'm merely just. And now mark my words—are you
                  listening?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Captain Waters."</p>
               <p>"Well, my dear Foy, in future treatises upon swordsmanship, after the author has
                  described every imaginable lunge, in carte, in tierce, in guard, semicircle,
                  octave, and flangonet—after all this, he will write, 'To these must be added the
                  coup used by Captain Foy, in his duel with Captain Waters at Reinfels, and known
                  as the <hi rend="i"/>Coup de Reinfels!' You see, comrade, 't is really
                  indescribable."</p>
               <p>"Upon my word, Captain Waters, you overwhelm me."</p>
               <p>"No, 't is the truth, and now confess that 't was better to be fighting over
                  there, with the jolliest comrades to look on, <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >morbleu,</foreign> than to be driving a quill here, under the nose of his
                  Excellency, with such rascally spectators as this Conolly and others!"</p>
               <p>The secretary's eye flashed, and his piercing look tried to plunge beneath the
                  captain's laughing face and divine his thoughts. But the soldier preserved the
                  most innocent air, gazing at Foy with the utmost simplicity and good humor.</p>
               <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6146-00000123"/>
               <p>The secretary suddenly turned away, and retired, as it were, into himself.</p>
               <p>"I have seen Major Conolly at the palace, it is true, Captain Waters," he said,
                  calmly, "but I have not the honor of his friendship."</p>
               <p>"A back-woodsman, is he not?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know, sir."</p>
               <p>"From Pennsylvania?"</p>
               <p>"I really regret my inability to deliver any thing, with certainty, upon the
                  subject, Captain Waters; and now, with your permission, I will first see his
                  Excellency a moment, and then retire, as I need rest."</p>
               <p>"A moment!" said the captain; "did you deliver my message?"</p>
               <p>"Your message, sir?"</p>
               <p>"To his Excellency, my dear Foy, about the Burgesses, you know. I experienced a
                  sentiment of real pride, yesterday, when they were turned out of the capitol, for
                  you will remember that I requested you to suggest that idea to his
                  Excellency!"</p>
               <p>Under this persevering banter, the calm secretary's pale countenance did not
                  move.</p>
               <p>"Your suggestion escaped my memory, sir," he said.</p>
               <p>"Ah! then 't was not on my account his Excellency dismissed the youngsters?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir."</p>
               <p>"Well, my dear Foy, you are not my friend, and as I have not had even the least
                  adventure or fight with his Excellency's handsome guards, commanded by that
                  broad-shouldered Mr. Lindon, I 'm in a furious bad humor. A soldier, though,
                  should not be discouraged. We may yet have a little encounter—who knows?"</p>
               <p>"All things are possible, Captain Waters," said the secretary, calmly; "now I must
                  leave you, sir."</p>
               <p>And with the same impassive air, the pale gentleman inclined his head, and
                  disappeared in the crowd.</p>
               <p>"Go on, snake! go on, conspirator!" said the captain, looking after him as he was
                  lost in the brilliant undulations of the excited and uproarious crowd; "I'll yet
                  cross your sword, and show you something better than the <hi rend="i"/>coup de
                  Reinfels! Come, my dear St. John, let's get a cup of Canary. Talking with that
                  fellow makes me choke, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">morbleu!</foreign>"</p>
               <p>And they entered the supper room.</p>

               <p>ST. JOHN had not advanced five steps beyond the thresh-old of the door, when he

               <p>The eyes of that gentleman were fixed upon him with an expression of rage and

               <p>Lindon seemed to hesitate between two courses—to throw into Mr. St. John's face
                  the glass of wine which he held in his hand, or publicly strike and outrage
                  him.</p>
               <p>A glance at the cold and resolute countenance of the young man, however, seemed to
                  deter him from pursuing either of these courses, and instead, he advanced two
                  steps, and made a low and exaggerated bow.</p>
               <p>"I have been looking for you, sir," he said, "I am glad that at last I have found
                  you."</p>
               <p>"Looking for me?" said St. John, with cold politeness.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Pray for what purpose, if I may venture to ask?"</p>
               <p>Lindon looked around, and seeing that the crowd were completely absorbed in
                  drinking healths and dispatching the viands, advanced another pace toward St.
                  John, and said,</p>
               <p>"I was looking for you in order to join me in making some arrangements, sir."</p>
               <pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6146-00000124"/>
               <p>"Arrangements?" said St. John; "pray explain yourself, Mr. Lindon."</p>
               <p>"You do not understand?"</p>
               <p>"I am very stupid this evening, and must beg you to explain."</p>
               <p>Lindon raised his head with haughty anger, and said,</p>
               <p>"The arrangements I desire, sir, are those to be made between my friend, Captain
                  Foy, his Excellency's private secretary, and a gentleman designated by
                  yourself."</p>
               <p>"Oh! a duel!" said St. John, coldly, "you mean a duel?"</p>
               <p>"Precisely," said Lindon, bowing ceremoniously, and biting his lip to hide his
                  wrath, "you have understood me at last, sir."</p>
               <p>St. John returned the cold gaze with a look as cold, and said,</p>
               <p>"May I ask, Mr. Lindon, why you consider it necessary to take my life, or for me
                  to take yours?"</p>
               <p>"That is wholly unnecessary!"</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, I think it is."</p>
               <p>"Mr. St. John, do you refuse my defiance? Do you first hide yourself, and when you
                  are found, retreat! I say retreat, sir! I have been looking for you, and I thought
                  it was only necessary to find you. Am I mistaken, sir?"</p>
               <p>A flash darted from the young man's eyes, and he raised his head with an air so
                  proud, that it far exceeded the state-liness of his adversary. For a moment he
                  made no reply to these words, but controlling himself at length, said, calmly,</p>
               <p>"I also have been looking for you, sir."</p>
               <p>"Good! then we understand each other perfectly!"</p>
               <p>"No, sir, I think not."</p>
               <p>"Sir?"</p>
               <p>"You sought me to deliver a defiance—"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"While I sought you to make you an apology."</p>
               <p>An expression of profound incredulity came to Lindon's face, and then this look
                  gave way to one of the deepest contempt.</p>
               <p>"I am glad I spoke," he said, with a curling lip, "before you had an opportunity
                  of addressing me. I will accept no apologies! I reject them in advance! I have
                  delivered my defiance, and I will not withdraw it!"</p>
               <p>St. John listened to these insulting words with an air of stupefaction almost. He
                  seemed scarcely to realize that fatuity could proceed so far.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Lindon," he said, at length, with eyes which seemed to blaze, "are you
                  demented, out of your senses, lunatic, or is it your intention to act a
                  comedy?"</p>
               <p>"Sir!"</p>
               <p>"I said simply that I sought you to make you that apology which is due from one
                  gentleman to another whose feelings he has unintentionally been the cause of
                  wounding. Stop, sir! Before this interview proceeds further I will make that
                  apology in spite of your insults. Another word such as you have just uttered will
                  seal my lips. I have therefore the honor to say, sir, that I had no part in the
                  stupid jest of that servant this evening, whose presumption it is my intention to
                  punish. I persist in making the explanation, that the use of that uniform by my
                  servant was wholly without my knowledge or consent—an explanation due to myself,
                  inasmuch as I will not suffer you or any one to think that I was guilty of so
                  ill-bred and puerile an action. Now, sir, I am not accustomed to make apologies; I
                  would much rather decide differences otherwise. If, after this full and complete
                  explanation, you still persist in your defiance—"</p>
               <p>"I do!" said Lindon, trembling with anger; "your statement may be true, or it may
                  be untrue; in either event I hold you responsible at the sword's point!"</p>
               <p>St. John stood for a moment pale and silent, confronting his insulting opponent.
                  He scarcely seemed to realize that hatred could go so far upon a basis so
                  trifling.</p>
               <pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6146-00000125"/>
               <p>"Well, sir!" said Lindon, "do you intend to show the white feather?"</p>
               <p>St. John turned paler than ever, and his eyes filled with blood.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Lindon," he said, sternly, "I will first ask <emph>you</emph> a
                  question."</p>
               <p>"Well, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Are you mad, or intoxicated?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir! I am neither! I am thirsty, sir, however, for your blood!"</p>
               <p>"For my blood? Then you take advantage of this trifle to insult me and break down
                  my patience."</p>
               <p>"I do!"</p>
               <p>"You do not fight for the cause you have specified?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Pray, why, then?"</p>
               <p>"Ask yourself, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Lindon, you will pardon me, but your conversation is either stupid, or you
                  are fond of enigmas—your real reason, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Ask yourself, I repeat!" said Lindon, pale with rage; "I suppose you have not
                  humiliated, laughed at, triumphed over me yonder sufficiently!"</p>
               <p>"I sir? I humiliated you, triumphed over you!" said St. John, in profound
                  astonishment.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir! your air of innocence and surprise does not dupe me! I am not to be
                  tricked by so shallow a device!"</p>
               <p>The profound and violent passion of the young man's nature, upon which he had
                  heretofore placed a resolute curb, began to rise and foam, as he listened to these
                  repeated insults.</p>
               <p>"You then design to force me to fight you about nothing!" he said, with increasing
                  anger.</p>
               <p>"Yes!" was the reply.</p>
               <p>"You refuse to tell me any rational grounds for your quarrel."</p>
               <p>"I do, sir! If you choose to ignore the fact that you have supplanted me, laughed
                  at me, made me a jest in your conversation with a young lady to whom I have paid
                  my addresses, then I give no reason! If you choose to put on a mask, and act your
                  part, and pretend ignorance," he continued, white with rage, "then I will not
                  explain myself! If you refuse to regard the words which I now utter in your
                  hearing as sufficiently insulting, I will make them more distinct and
                  unmistakeable! If no <emph>word</emph> of insult will move you, and induce you to
                  give me that satisfaction which you rightfully owe me, then I'll throw this glass
                  of wine in your face, sir! and we'll see if that outrage will arouse you!"</p>
               <p>St. John advanced a step, with a countenance as pale as death, in which his dark
                  eyes burned like coals of fire.</p>
               <p>"Enough, sir!" he said, in a voice low and distinct; "you have accomplished your
                  purpose, which was doubtless to drive me beyond all patience. We had better pause
                  at the <emph>words,</emph> sir. Were you to move your arm to throw that wine-glass
                  in my face, I should kill you where you stand. I have the honor, sir, to place
                  myself entirely at your orders. My friend, Captain Waters, will doubtless act for
                  me."</p>
               <p>And taking a step backward, the young man bowed with cold ceremony, and was
                  silent. An expression of fierce satisfaction diffused itself over his adversary's
                  face and he also bowed low.</p>
               <p>"Really," said Captain Waters in the most cheerful voice, "'t is delightful to see
                  an affair conducted in this elegant way! Will I act for you, my dear St. John? Why
                  certainly I will; and now I have the honor to inform Mr. Lindon, that my dear
                  friend, Captain Foy, or other gentleman representing him, will find me all day
                  to-morrow at the Raleigh tavern. Eh? Is that satisfactory?"</p>
               <p>"Perfectly," said Lindon, haughtily; "you shall hear from Captain Foy."</p>
               <p>"Good!" said the soldier in a friendly tone; "that is excellent! <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">Morbleu!</foreign> 't will give me absolute delight to act<pb
                     n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6146-00000126"/> with Foy. Who knows but he'll take a
                  hand himself? And then hurrah for the <hi rend="i"/>coup of Reinfels!"</p>
               <p>The captain's spirits seemed to have risen immensely, and he curled his moustache
                  with an air of the proudest satisfaction.</p>
               <p>"Come, my dear St. John," he said, "as this little affair's arranged, let us get
                  our Canary and—"</p>
               <p>"No, I believe I'll return, captain, but I won't take you. I may count on
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"To the death!"</p>
               <p>"Then I will see you to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"I'll arrange all duly. Come dine at 'Flodden' and I'll report to you. Is it
                  understood?"</p>
               <p>St. John nodded, and they parted. His interview with Lindon had passed unnoticed
                  almost.</p>
               <p>The crowd, in the midst of their uproar and revelry, had only seen two men holding
                  an animated conversation, terminating in a ceremonious bow. So sees the world.</p>
               <p>As St. John left his side, the captain muttered, with a smile,</p>
               <p>"Lieutenant St. John and Lieutenant Lindon! Captain Waters and Captain Foy! Why
                  the affair arranges itself <foreign xml:lang="FRA">morbleu!</foreign>"</p>
               <p>And he twirled his long black moustache with joyous ardor.</p>
               <p>As St. John appeared in the dancing room, the assembly was coming to an end. It
                  terminated with a reel, as usual, and the manner in which the ladies whirled round
                  in their great hooped skirts, or darted from end to end of the apartment, was
                  marvelous to behold. More than one pile of curls lost the pearl loops and comb
                  which held them, and fell in raven or golden showers on snowy shoulders, sending
                  on the air a storm of perfumed powder. But the accident was unheeded—the reel
                  overthrows the influence of ceremony, and they danced on carelessly until the long
                  scrape of the musician's bow gave the signal that the assembly was at an end.</p>
               <p>It was the expiring compliment to royalty in Virginia. It was sent upon its way
                  that evening with a "Joy go with you!" and the most stately bows and curteseys;
                  the next ball in which the representatives of England were concerned, was opened
                  on the battle-field.</p>
               <p>It was a singular celebration, coming as it did between the seditious assemblage
                  of Burgesses, in the Raleigh, in the morning, and the fasting, humiliation, and
                  prayer of the first of June. This last recommendation of the Burgesses was widely
                  responded to, and the gentlemen and ladies of the colony went into mourning on
                  that day, and heard a sermon, and fasted, and prayed for the liberties of the
                  land, threatened by the Boston Port bill.<ref rend="super" target="#note_033"
                     xml:id="return_033">*</ref> In the old church of Williamsburg, the patriotic
                  clergyman did not mind the presence of the frowning Governor, and spoke without

               </note>
               <p>Two hours after the breaking up of the assembly, St. John was looking pensively
                  through his window, when he saw a light glimmer in a window opposite, and in an
                  instant Bonnybel appeared in the luminous circle of rays.</p>
               <p>The figure of the young lady, clad in her night dress of snowy white, was visible
                  for an instant only. A white arm was raised, the falling sleeve of the robe
                  leaving it bare, and the extinguisher plunged the whole into darkness.</p>
               <p>"I am fond of emblematics," muttered the young man, with his sardonic smile,
                  beneath which was, however, concealed bitter pain and melancholy, "and here I have
                  one that suits my case admirably! I beam my brightest for her, and think that she
                  values me somewhat, when down comes the extinguisher! I am put out at a word!
                  Well, so let it be! I have something else on my hands now. I need rest for
                  to-morrow."</p>
               <p>And without further words, he retired to bed.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XLVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">ST. JOHN GOES TO "FLODDEN."</head>
               <p>ON the next morning, St. John made the Vanes a visit, at Mr. Burwell's, and found
                  them all ready to depart. The chariot was at the door.</p>
               <p>To the cordial invitation of the colonel to return with them, the young man
                  responded by saying that he had "important business," which might detain him some
                  days; he would come as soon as was possible. Few words passed between himself and
                  Bonnybel, and these were very formal and constrained. So they departed.</p>
               <p>The young man then turned his thoughts to another subject. We have seen that he
                  had appointed with Captain Waters to come and dine with that worthy, and hear the
                  result of the negotiations with Foy, and toward the captain's, which was up the
                  river, he now directed his way, mounted on "Tallyho," who cantered on gayly, and
                  soon left Williamsburg in the far distance.</p>
               <p>A ride of an hour brought St. John in front of a fine old building crowning a
                  bluff of the James, and surveying, from its lofty position, the wide expanse of
                  field, and stream, and forest.</p>
               <p>This was "Flodden," the residence of Captain Ralph Waters, and, far off, across
                  the river, on a lofty hill toward the west, the young man discerned the walls of
                  his own house, "Flower of Hundreds," embowered in the spring foliage, and
                  glittering in the fresh light of morning.</p>
               <p>St. John had scarcely drawn rein at the door of "Flodden," when the voice of
                  Captain Waters, from within the hall, greeted him jovially, and the next moment
                  saw the figure of the soldier advance, with a smile of welcome on the bold
                  features.</p>
               <p>St. John's horse was led away, and they entered.</p>
               <p>"Why, here you are as punctual as a clock, <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >morbleu!</foreign>" cried the captain; "delighted to see you on this glorious
                  morning. Faith! it makes a man laugh in spite of him!"</p>
               <p>And the captain performed that ceremony with great gusto. When the worthy soldier
                  laughed he seemed simply to carry out the design for which his features were
                  moulded, as we have said elsewhere in speaking of him.</p>
               <p>His bold and vigorous nature appeared to find food for laughter in every thing,
                  and his clear eyes looked the whole world in the face with careless good
                  humor.</p>
               <p>"A fine animal that?" said the captain, gazing at "Tallyho," as he was led away,
                  "and I see Selim's blood plain in him."</p>
               <p>"You are right, captain."</p>
               <p>"Well, you see, I seldom am any thing else in regard to horses."</p>
               <p>"And as to men?"</p>
               <p>"Well!" said Captain Waters, curling his moustache, "I judge them tolerably too.
                  There 's Foy, now, thinks he 's duping your humble servant, and preserves the most
                  mysterious air about things I 'm perfectly acquainted with. Really, a perfect
                  snake in the grass is that Foy!"</p>
               <p>And the captain curled his moustache downward, a sign of disdain with him
                  always.</p>
               <p>"You have seen him of course," said St. John, "as he acts for Mr. Lindon?"</p>
               <p>"Why, certainly, my dear fellow," returned the captain, "and we had the most
                  charming little interview you ever heard of. Wait till we 're alone, after dinner,
                  comrade, and I'll tell you how it was."</p>
               <p>"Good! I'll listen with pleasure, and I 'm not curious at present. Tell me when we
                  've dined."</p>
               <p>"Count on that, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami,</foreign> and now let 's go see
                  madam and the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bon père.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"With pleasure!"</p>
               <p>Madam, whom the captain addressed also, from time to time, as Henriette, was an
                  extremely handsome dame of<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6146-00000128"/> about
                  thirty, perhaps a year or two more, and carried herself with an air of the most
                  aristocratic ease. Two little girls played on the carpet at her side, and a little
                  boy was busy on a wooden horse in the distance.</p>
               <p>Opposite this domestic group sat old John Waters, the captain's father, in his
                  wide, softly-cushioned chair, with his benignant smile, his gray, thin locks, and
                  his empty pipe carelessly resting against his knee.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Waters advanced, with her courtly and graceful ease, to press St. John's
                  hand, the old man rose erect in his chair, and smiled more benignantly than ever,
                  and even the little girls rose too, and came, bashfully peering from their showers
                  of golden curls, to receive their share of the young man's attention.</p>
               <p>It was only Captain Ralph Waters, jr., that somewhat petted and spoiled young
                  gentleman, who paid no attention to the visitor.</p>
               <p>"See the domestic and touching group!" said the captain; "the hen in the midst of
                  her chickens; the dame partlet scratching and clucking."</p>
               <p>Madam Henriette shook her handsome head, threateningly, at this address, and
                  said,</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, and pray what are you?"</p>
               <p>"I 'm a rooster," observed the captain with great candor; "you see, my dear
                  partlet, I fought the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Français</foreign> so long, and
                  heard the crowing of the Gallic cock so often, that <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >morbleu!</foreign> I've turned to a rooster completely."</p>
               <p>"And I suppose you like to crow over us poor women?"</p>
               <p>"Exactly."</p>
               <p>"Is he not a shameful man, Mr. St. John?" said the lady, laughing; "he has not the
                  least regard for our feelings."</p>
               <p>"Your feelings, madam?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; only the other day I requested him to buy me a set of pearls at Rowsay's, in
                  town, and he absolutely refused."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible, captain?" said St. John; "could you resist?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my dear boy," said the captain, heaving a sigh, "I was hard-hearted to that
                  extent."</p>
               <p>"You acknowledge it then?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly."</p>
               <p>"Is that not dreadful, Mr. St. John?" said the lady; "there is only one excuse
                  that he gives; can you divine it?"</p>
               <p>"No indeed."</p>
               <p>"This excuse is, that he bought me some diamonds! It is true that the diamonds
                  cost ten times as much as the pearls, and I greatly preferred them, and said so.
                  But he knew that I did not wish to be so extravagant, and like an unfeeling man,
                  he went and bought the diamonds!"</p>
               <p>The captain looked guilty and conscience-stricken—his expression of remorse was
                  affecting.</p>
               <p>"Well, well, my dear," he said, "do not thus expose my failings to the public.
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Ventrebleu!</foreign> I 'm ashamed, but you see
                  diamonds have always attracted me since—"</p>
               <p>The captain paused.</p>
               <p>"Since when, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Since I won your heart with that diamond necklace, my dear Henriette!" replied
                  Captain Waters, with simplicity, "some time in the good year '65, I think."</p>
               <p>At this charge, madame seemed to be actually overcome by indignation. Her work
                  dropped upon her knee, she gazed steadily at her enemy, and then burst into
                  laughter.</p>
               <p>"Mr. St. John I hope you will pardon me," she said, struggling with her mirth,
                  "but this gentleman, Captain Waters, always sets me off! Look at him there,
                  everlastingly playing with that horrid moustache, stooping in his shoulders, and
                  pretending to be dreaming, as he thrums on his chair. Just look!"</p>
               <p>"Dreaming?" said the captain; "was I dreaming <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma
                     chére?</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, you were!" cried Mrs. Henriette, laughing.</p>
               <p>"I believe I was," said the captain, whose bold face grew<pb n="256-257"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000129"/> suddenly very sad, "I was thinking of those good
                  old times, and our Beatrice."</p>
               <p>The martial head drooped, and for a moment there was silence.</p>
               <p>The lady's face, too, had passed from smiles to sadness—from mirth to
                  pensiveness.</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Eh bien!</foreign>" said the captain, heaving a sigh;
                  "let us not rake in the ashes for those buried memories. I 'll dream no more, but
                  rather light the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bon pére's</foreign> pipe. Eh? Shall I,
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon pére?</foreign>"</p>
               <p>The old man assented with a smile and a nod, and the lady laid down her work and
                  went and arranged the cricket for his feet in the kindest and most attentive
                  way.</p>
               <p>The little girls then leaned on grandpa's knee to see the brilliant glow in the
                  bowl of the pipe, and then the old man was left alone to his dreams, and Captain
                  Waters and his friend strolled out through the grounds, talking of every thing but
                  the real subject, which, by general consent, had been deferred.</p>
               <p>Thus passed the morning at Flodden.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XLIX.</head>
               <head type="sub">HOW CAPTAIN RALPH WATERS FULFILLED HIS MISSION.</head>
               <p>"NOW, my dear comrade," said the captain, when he and St. John were alone over
                  their wine, "now we can come to our little arrangements, and I can report
                  progress."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, my dear captain," replied St. John, "and first, what time is fixed
                  on?"</p>
               <p>"To-morrow morning."</p>
               <p>"The place?"</p>
               <p>"Jamestown island. Have you any objection?"</p>
               <p>"None captain, though I was there lately upon a more agreeable errand."</p>
               <p>"Well, that 's settled then; but I'll proceed more in order and tell you how I set
                  to work—shall I?"</p>
               <p>"It will interest me."</p>
               <p>"Well," said the captain, filling his glass and pushing the bottle, "I was at the
                  Raleigh tavern duly as I informed Monseigneur Lindon, and I duly received a visit
                  from Foy—"</p>
               <p>"A strange second, is he not?"</p>
               <p>"Why no—how?"</p>
               <p>"He looks so peaceful?"</p>
               <p>"You do n't know him, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami;</foreign> he 's a perfect
                  take-in, that Foy is—a real sword blade, <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >ventrebleu!</foreign> Well Foy came and we made each other the lowest and most
                  courteous bow. You see we are both of us old hands at this business, and we went
                  at it like ducks to water. 'My dear Foy, is it so and so?' 'Yes, my dear captain,'
                  bowing, smiling, as amicable as two ganders hissing and wagging their beaks at
                  each other."</p>
               <p>St. John smiled.</p>
               <p>"Then every thing was easily arranged?"</p>
               <p>"By no means."</p>
               <p>"Explain yourself."</p>
               <p>"With pleasure. Foy, you see, was in favor of going out of the province to
                  fight—"</p>
               <p>"Out of the province!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, he was a little touchy about Dunmore, and so the conversation was something
                  like the following. I listen to his proposition, smiling politely, and the first
                  remark I make is, 'My dear Foy, are you afraid?'</p>
               <p>"'Afraid, sir?' he says, coldly; 'I am not accustomed to feel afraid!'</p>
               <p>"'Oh well, my dear comrade, do n't be offended,' I replied, 'it really did seem to
                  me that this looked something like fear—of his Excellency.'</p>
               <p>"'His Excellency is not my master, Captain Waters.'</p>
               <p>"'Really, now, is he not?'</p>
               <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6146-00000130"/>
               <p>"'No, sir!' this observation being uttered with a sort of flash out of the eyes,
                  you see.</p>
               <p>"'Oh, my dear comrade,' I say, 'just see now how you are deprived of that praise
                  which is justly your due! 'T is whispered everywhere that it is <emph>his
                     Excellency</emph> who really employs Conolly in his rascally mission to embroil
                  the borderers, and that you are only the instrument he uses, when in fact you are
                  all the while head man.'"</p>
               <p>"Why, captain," said St. John, smiling, "that seems to me nothing more nor less
                  than an insult!"</p>
               <p>"Precisely, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami,</foreign>" said the captain,
                  cheerfully, "just so."</p>
               <p>"You wished to insult Captain Foy?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"For what purpose?"</p>
               <p>"In order that a little affair might be hatched between him and myself."</p>
               <p>"Ah! indeed!"</p>
               <p>"Exactly, my dear fellow. <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Ventrebleu!</foreign> you have
                  no idea how many overtures I have made to Foy in order to draw him into a quarrel.
                  But he won't take offense."</p>
               <p>"Your object? Do you hate him?"</p>
               <p>"Not at all."</p>
               <p>"Why then—"</p>
               <p>"Wish to fight him? Simply because I wish to put an end to his maneuvers! I do
                  hate Dunmore, and by running Foy through the gizzard, you see, I disable his
                  Excellency's right arm to the shoulder blade."</p>
               <p>The cheerful way in which Captain Waters unfolded these views was admirable to
                  behold.</p>
               <p>"I 'm merely a rude soldier, you see, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami,</foreign>"
                  he continued, "but having learned diplomacy on the continent, I practice it here.
                  That was my object then in drawing Foy out, and I thought I had him that
                  time!"</p>
               <p>"What did he reply?"</p>
               <p>"Well, for a moment he said nothing. You see, I had said that <emph>he</emph>
                  ought to have the praise of employing Conolly on that <emph>rascally
                     mission,</emph> and I waited, smiling, for him to insult me again."</p>
               <p>"Did he fail to?"</p>
               <p>"Point blank. I was all ready—getting my hand ready to take off my hat and bow,
                  and say, 'Well, when shall we settle our little difference, comrade?' In a word, I
                  looked for an explosion. It never came. Foy only looks at me with those wicked
                  eyes, and says, 'I have already disclaimed more than a passing acquaintance with
                  Major Conolly, Captain Waters—let us return to our affair.'</p>
               <p>"'In an instant, directly, my dear comrade,' I say politely, 'but first tell me
                  one thing.'</p>
               <p>"'What is that, sir?'</p>
               <p>"'Is it really true,' I continued, smiling, 'that Conolly has orders from Dunmore,
                  or his tools in Williamsburg, to promise the Indians assistance from his
                  Excellency, if they make an inroad and massacre the people on the Virginia
                  borders?'</p>
               <p>"As I say this, Foy's eye flashes worse than ever, and his thin lips contract. He
                  advances a step, frowning.</p>
               <p>"'Captain Waters,' he says, 'do I look like a man who is fond of being
                  insulted?'</p>
               <p>"'Why no, comrade.'</p>
               <p>"'Do I look like a man,' he continues, does this red-hot Foy! 'who would leave his
                  sword in its scabbard if it was possible to draw it?'</p>
               <p>"'No,' I reply, 'and whether you look so or not, I know you can use it, and have
                  the will, companion.'</p>
               <p>"'Well, sir,' he says, with real dignity, hang him! 'well, sir, if I do not cram
                  down your throat the insults you have addressed to me, you may understand that I
                  refrain simply because my hands are bound for the present by the office I hold,
                  otherwise, Captain Waters,' he adds, bowing, 'it would give me immense pleasure to
                  cut your throat!' Those were his very words."</p>
               <p>And the soldier burst out laughing, in which laughter St. John united.</p>
               <pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6146-00000131"/>
               <p>"You see, after that, my dear fellow," said the captain, "I could not add another
                  insult."</p>
               <p>"Certainly not."</p>
               <p>"In fact I positively adored Foy after that reply! He looked so gallant, when he
                  said it! he touched his left side, where a sword ought to have been, with such an
                  air! he was so cool, and elegant, and ferocious, when he mentioned his desire to
                  cut my throat, that I could have embraced him as a brother!"</p>
               <p>The captain twirled his moustache with admiration to his very eyes as he spoke,
                  and seemed lost in delighted contemplation.</p>
               <p>"Well," said St. John, laughing, "after that the interview was more friendly?"</p>
               <p>"Friendly! I believe you! After that it was positively fraternal! Then it was that
                  we came to resemble two highbred geese, nodding our heads, and uttering 'Ah's!'
                  and 'Oh's!' and 'By no means!' and 'Really captain's!' You ought to have seen us!
                  We would not overcome each other; we could not force each other to accept what
                  each wanted. It was,</p>
               <p>"'Really, my dear Captain Waters, it must be Jamestown island, as you wish!'</p>
               <p>"'No, upon my honor, my dear Foy, it shall be out of the province, as you
                  desire!'</p>
               <p>"'I never can consent to inconvenience such a gallant man!'</p>
               <p>"'I never should hold up my head again if I forced such a noble gentleman as you,
                  my dear Foy, to quarrel with his Excellency!' It was this, that, the other, no,
                  yes, really, truly! At last I yielded, and to see how Foy pressed my hand you
                  would have thought I had done him the greatest favor in the world.</p>
               <p>"'I shall not quarrel with his Excellency, captain,' he says, smiling, 'and I have
                  already said he is not my master.'</p>
               <p>"'Do n't allude to my miserable rudeness, comrade" I reply; 'it wounds me to the
                  heart, and I shall shed tears.'</p>
               <p>"'That is all forgotten, captain,' says Foy; 'a mere jest. Do not think that I
                  shall suffer from engaging as second in a combat to take place at Jamestown
                  island. His Excellency will not inquire very closely, for you know, my dear
                  Captain Waters,' adds Foy, with a tiger smile, 'you know my principal, Mr. Lindon,
                  is a perfect master of every weapon, and he'll be sure to kill Mr. St. John! You
                  will understand, in the present state of affairs between Mr. St. John and his
                  Excellency,' adds Foy, smiling, 'that Mr. Lindon or myself will not be very
                  severely scolded!'"</p>
               <p>"Pshaw, captain!" said St. John, "your hero turns out a boaster, and a mere
                  blood-thirsty calculator of chances!"</p>
               <p>"Certainly! Do n't you comprehend that all his bowing and smiling was acted?"</p>
               <p>"Eh?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing less," returned the captain. "Foy, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon
                     ami!</foreign> is, by nature, as great a comedian as that celebrated little
                  Garrick I saw in London. I know him well—but, to finish."</p>
               <p>"Yes, let us hear the rest."</p>
               <p>"I will be more brief. The weapons then came up, and we had some discussion as to
                  the length and other points. There was no real difficulty, because both you and
                  Mr. Lindon prefer swords. So that was arranged, and I engaged to provide them of
                  exactly the same length. It is the ordinary length, and I'll show them to you
                  directly. Then the hour of seven, to-morrow morning, was fixed on, and we parted,
                  mutually pleased with each other. My only hope with Foy now is to drive him into
                  insulting <emph>me,</emph> and then of course he can't refuse my challenge. I
                  would cheerfully pay five hundred pounds to have him, for ten minutes, at arm's
                  length!"</p>
               <p>Having expressed himself cheerfully to this effect, Captain Waters emptied his
                  glass, and suggested a stroll on the lawn.</p>
               <p>The young man rose, and the captain led the way out.<pb n="262-263"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000132"/> It had been arranged that St. John should remain at
                  Flodden for convenience, and accompany his host in his own carriage, and every
                  detail being thus determined on, even down to the hour to awake, the subject was
                  for the moment dismissed.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE FUGITIVE.</head>
               <p>THE two friends made the circuit of the lawn, and had reached the broad gate, when
                  a man, riding at full speed, drew up suddenly before them and inclined his
                  head.</p>
               <p>"Will you be good enough to inform me, sir," he said, addressing the captain who
                  was foremost, "whether this is the road to the town of Richmond?"</p>
               <p>"It is, sir," replied the soldier; "and you have only to follow it and you 'll
                  soon arrive at that place."</p>
               <p>"And that other road branching off?" asked the horseman, extending his hand, and
                  at the same moment looking over his shoulder.</p>
               <p>"That leads to New Kent Court House, to Hanover, or King William, and so,
                  west."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, sir," said the stranger, hurriedly, and with another glance over his
                  shoulder, he struck spurs into his horse, and departed at a rapid gallop.</p>
               <p>The eyes of the two men followed him, and they saw him turn into the road to New
                  Kent, disappearing in an instant in the pines.</p>
               <p>The captain shook his head.</p>
               <p>"There 's something wrong about this gentleman, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon
                     ami,</foreign>" he said; "something lies beneath this, take my word for it! But
                  I could n't refuse to reply to a civil question."</p>
               <p>"No—and I agree with you. Who could it be, captain?"</p>
               <p>"Faith, I can't imagine.! If, now, it had occurred on the continent—"</p>
               <p>"What?"</p>
               <p>"Why, I should have set our rapid cavalier down for a king's messenger. But, you
                  know, we do n't have kings on the western continent, a circumstance for which I do
                  n't mind saying I 'm grateful, comrade.</p>
               <p>"They 're a poor set of fellows," added the soldier; "I've seen many and never
                  admired one. You see, my dear fellow, they are shams, and they know it; from his
                  gracious Majesty George III., defender of the faith, et cetera, down to his royal
                  highness of Poland, a post which my friends, General Littlepage, and Captain
                  Charles Lee, very nearly occupied. I 'm glad they did n't lower themselves; and
                  these are my views! Who the devil could this horseman have been?"</p>
               <p>"I can't tell you."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, let him go on; I care nothing, <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >morbleu!</foreign> As Effingham says, my friend Champ, you know, ''t is all in
                  the game,' and so he may go on!"</p>
               <p>Having reached this extremely philosophical conclusion, the captain twirled his
                  moustache, and led the way back to the mansion, which he and his companion
                  entered.</p>
               <p>They had scarcely disappeared when three horsemen, riding at full speed, shot by
                  the gate on the track of the fugitive.</p>
               <p>They bent in their saddles as they rode, and evidently examined the highway for
                  the marks of hoofs, by which they seemed to follow and track their game.</p>
               <p>Coming, in a moment, to the cross road leading to New Kent, which the fugitive had
                  taken, they suddenly drew up, and one of them dismounted.</p>
               <p>It was the stranger, the friend of St. John.</p>
               <p>"Friends," he said, in his calm, deep voice, "he has not followed the high road
                  further. Here are his footprints; he has turned off toward the court house.
                  Come!"</p>
               <p>And getting into his saddle again, he took the lead, and the whole troop
                  disappeared in the foliage.</p>
               <p>Let us follow them.</p>
               <pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6146-00000133"/>
               <p>They darted on, at full speed, for more than a mile, and then, reaching the summit
                  of a hill, distinctly perceived the fugitive ascending another hill, at full
                  gallop, half a mile in advance of them.</p>
               <p>"Look!" cried the stranger; "there! see! we shall arrest him!"</p>
               <p>And digging the spur into his horse's side, he darted onward, taking the lead of
                  his companions.</p>
               <p>The solitary horseman had turned in his saddle and seen them, and a gesture of
                  rage and despair, visible even at the great distance, showed how much he feared
                  the encounter.</p>
               <p>The pursuers rode furiously for another mile, and entered the somber woodland of
                  pines, whose summits were now gilded by the last rays of the setting sun.</p>
               <p>With bent heads, as they rode at full gallop, the stranger and his companions
                  scanned the road, to convince themselves that the fugitive had not turned aside
                  into the woodland.</p>
               <p>The tracks continued in the center of the road, and they pushed on at full
                  speed.</p>
               <p>Nearly five miles thus ran from beneath the rapid feet of their horses, and still
                  the tracks held the center of the highway.</p>
               <p>Suddenly one of the riders stretched out his hand, and said, "Look!"</p>
               <p>Two hundred yards before them, a horse without a rider was flying onward, and
                  panting heavily as he ran.</p>
               <p>The stranger uttered a growl, as it were, of disappointment, and drew rein
                  suddenly.</p>
               <p>"He has dismounted and escaped into the woods!" he said, calmly; "we need not
                  further follow the highway."</p>
               <p>The three horsemen drew up, and with the heads of their animals thus touching,
                  held a rapid consultation with the stranger.</p>
               <p>It was quickly decided that each should take different directions, and beat the
                  whole country for traces of the fugitive.</p>
               <p>"Be alert, friends! do not stop! do not sleep!" said the stranger, whose fiery
                  eyes plunged into the woodland, upon which the shades of night were rapidly
                  descending; "it is of the first importance, as you know, that this man's
                  dispatches shall be secured! It will be for us a powerful engine! Come! to work!
                  forward! We may still arrest him on his way."</p>
               <p>And the three horsemen separated, each taking different ways.</p>
               <p>The dark pines received them, and they disappeared like shadows, the sound of
                  their hoofs dying away in the somber depths, from which nothing was heard but the
                  cries of night birds, and the harsh murmur of frogs in the swampy, low
                  grounds.</p>
               <p>As they disappeared, a pile of brushwood, deep in the woodland, stirred slightly,
                  a man's head rose, and seeing that the coast was clear, the man emerged from the
                  brush, and listened.</p>
               <p>"Well gentlemen," he said, with a sinister smile which made his eyes glitter in
                  the starlight, "I have escaped your toils, I think, and you will probably have an
                  agreeable time of it beating the bushes of the country-side here. I have my papers
                  all safe here in my breast, most worthy patriots, and there they will remain for
                  the present. I shall only arrive at Fort Pitt a little later, and our affairs will
                  not suffer. It 's odds if I do not pay you, and the people of Virginia generally,
                  for this little night ride!"</p>
               <p>He paused a moment and listened.</p>
               <p>"All is still," he said, "and now it only remains to get another horse. That 's
                  easy, as my pockets are well lined by his lordship! Come! let us not despair; I
                  trust in the doctrine of chances, and they've seldom failed me!"</p>
               <p>Having thus spoken, the fugitive turned, resolutely, deeper into the woodland, and
                  was soon lost in the darkness.</p>

               <p>ON the next morning, after a sound night's rest on the captain's part, and much
                  tossing to and fro, in his dreams, on St. John's, the friends met and greeted each
                  other.</p>
               <p>Madam Henriette met them with a smile.</p>
               <p>"Where in the world are you going so early?" she said to her husband; "breakfast
                  is ready—but why set out so soon?"</p>
               <p>The captain saw that his wife was dying with curiosity, but he only smiled; he did
                  not reply.</p>
               <p>"This is not court day, I believe, Mr. St. John?"</p>
               <p>"No, madam, I think not."</p>
               <p>"Does any thing of interest take place in town this morning?"</p>
               <p>"I have not heard, madam."</p>
               <p>"Then where in the world are you going, Captain Waters? You really are the most
                  provoking—"</p>
               <p>"My dear Henriette—"</p>
               <p>"Well, sir?"</p>
               <p>"I think you said that breakfast was ready?"</p>
               <p>The lady pouted, and said that it was.</p>
               <p>"Then, with your leave, we will proceed to eat it. <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Ventre
                     bleu!</foreign> I 'm as hungry as a hawk after all that sleep!"</p>
               <p>And the captain led the way into the breakfast room, and did the honors of his
                  board.</p>
               <p>Thereafter, his carriage was ordered at once, and he and St. John put on their
                  hats.</p>
               <p>"What in the world is that bundle they are putting in the carriage?" said Mrs.
                  Henriette.</p>
               <p>"Are they putting a bundle in the carriage?" said the captain, with interest.</p>
               <p>"Yes, you see they are!"</p>
               <p>"Well, so they are."</p>
               <p>And the captain put on his gloves.</p>
               <p>"When will you be back?" asked the lady thus constantly foiled.</p>
               <p>"Do n't know," said the captain.</p>
               <p>"Where <emph>can</emph> you be going?"</p>
               <p>"Did you say it was a fine morning, my dear St. John? Why glorious!"</p>
               <p>"Captain Waters!" said the lady, with an imperious little stamp of the foot.</p>
               <p>"Did you speak, my dear?" said the soldier.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir! I asked you to be so good as to tell me where you and Mr. St. John are
                  going?"</p>
               <p>"Why yes!" said the captain, "certainly, my dear."</p>
               <p>"Yes, what, sir?"</p>
               <p>"The moon <emph>is,</emph> most probably, green cheese."</p>
               <p>The captain uttered these words with a cheerful and smiling air, which caused Mrs.
                  Henriette to pat her little foot with impatience and vexation.</p>
               <p>"I think it 's very cruel in you!" she said, pouting.</p>
               <p>The captain twirled his moustache absently.</p>
               <p>"Won't you please tell me?"</p>
               <p>The captain smiled.</p>
               <p>"Won't you tell your Henriette, Ralph?" said the lady, with an entreating air, and
                  leaning on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>The captain's lip curled with smiles.</p>
               <p>"You know it 's so simple—just a word," she said, coaxingly; "won't Ralph tell his
                  Henriette?"</p>
               <p>The captain smiled again and ended by laughing.</p>
               <p>"I think I can!" he said, absently.</p>
               <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6146-00000135"/>
               <p>"Tell me, my dear! I thought you would!"</p>
               <p>"I 'm sure I can!" continued the soldier, with his eyes fixed upon vacancy.</p>
               <p>"Certainly nothing is more proper, Ralph, to your own loving wife!"</p>
               <p>The captain woke, as it were, from his dream.</p>
               <p>"What is that, my love?" he said; "do you agree with me that it 's proper? But
                  what do <emph>you</emph> know about such things? You can't tell whether Foy will
                  resign his secretaryship."</p>
               <p>"You were not listening to me then, sir!" said Mrs. Henriette, imperiously.</p>
               <p>"No, my love."</p>
               <p>"You did not hear me?"</p>
               <p>"Have you been speaking?"</p>
               <p>"You are a disgraceful husband, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Why?" asked the captain, cheerfully.</p>
               <p>"Because you will not tell me, or even listen. But you <emph>shall</emph> tell me
                  where you 're going with Mr. St. John, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Well, my love."</p>
               <p>"You are outrageous!"</p>
               <p>"So I am, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma chére!</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"Where are you going?"</p>
               <p>"To Jericho."</p>
               <p>"Captain Waters!"</p>
               <p>"Madam!"</p>
               <p>"What are you going to do?"</p>
               <p>"Take the air!"</p>
               <p>The lady, flushed with vexation, and half-threatening, half-laughing, caught away
                  the captain's hat.</p>
               <p>"You <emph>shall</emph> tell me?" she said, laughing.</p>
               <p>The captain recovered his hat, and bursting into responsive laughter, cried,</p>
               <p>"Away, <emph>partlet!</emph> silence, hen! Go make the bibs and tuckers for the
                  chickens, and do n't meddle with the rooster's private matters!"</p>
               <p>The captain then squeezed Mrs. Henriette's cheeks with his fingers, gallantly
                  ravished a kiss, and followed by his friend, got into the carriage.</p>
               <p>"That 's a charming wife of mine, my dear boy," he said, as they rolled rapidly on
                  their way; "though slightly subject to curiosity, her only failing. Well, well,
                  let 's be charitable! And now, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami,</foreign> I will
                  give you my views upon the subject of Lindon's style of fencing. Let us compare
                  views."</p>
               <p>The captain then proceeded to enter at length upon his favorite topic, and he was
                  still speaking when they reached the low peninsula of Jamestown.</p>
               <p>The soldier referred to his timepiece.</p>
               <p>"Just seven," he said, "and here come Foy and Lindon."</p>

               <p>THE two carriages arrived almost at the same moment, and the hostile parties, as
                  they issued forth, made each other a low bow.</p>
               <p>Lindon was superbly dressed, but Captain Foy wore his customary suit of black,
                  fitting closely to his slender and nervous figure.</p>
               <p>Around his waist was buckled a plain sword, with yellow leather accoutrements, the
                  whole very much worn.</p>
               <p>Captain Waters had no sooner accomplished his bow, than, assuming a most engaging
                  smile, he pointed to the weapon of the secretary, and said,</p>
               <p>"Do n't I recognize an old friend there, comrade? It seems to me that sword is not
                  new to me, and I even think it once ran into my body, did it not?"</p>
               <p>Captain Foy made a modest gesture, and said,</p>
               <p>"Let us forget our youthful contentions, Captain Waters; they are of no importance
                  now."</p>
               <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6146-00000136"/>
               <p>"But really, I 'm curious," said the captain; "did you not wear that sword—"</p>
               <p>"At Reinfels? Yes, sir. 'T is an old companion, with whom I 'm loth to part. Shall
                  we now proceed to make our arrangements?"</p>
               <p>"With pleasure; here are the swords."</p>
               <p>The bundle was unwrapped, and the weapons were measured.</p>
               <p>"Exact to an inch, these two," said Captain Waters, "and you may take either."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, captain, I accept this."</p>
               <p>And Foy took one of the swords, and critically examined its point.</p>
               <p>He then made it whistle to and fro in his vigorous and nervous grasp, listening if
                  the blade clicked in the hilt.</p>
               <p>The examination seemed to satisfy him perfectly, and making his opponent another
                  bow, he said,</p>
               <p>"I find this weapon perfect, Captain Waters, and we may now proceed to business,
                  as the position of these gentlemen is already determined upon, north and south
                  with the sun."</p>
               <p>"Yes, my dear comrade; you really fill me with admiration, and make me remember
                  old times. Could n't we have a little bout now, after this event is through; a
                  mere friendly pass or two?"</p>
               <p>"I would rather not, captain; you might wound me, and I can not afford to lose my
                  time now, having much to attend to."</p>
               <p>"You retain your post of secretary?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>The captain sighed.</p>
               <p>"My dear Foy," he said, "I'll give you five hundred pounds if you'll resign."</p>
               <p>"I regret to say that 't is impossible for me to accept your offer, Captain
                  Waters. Shall we proceed?"</p>
               <p>"Of course, of course!"</p>
               <p>And the captain examined St. John's sword as carefully as his opponent had tested
                  Lindon's.</p>
               <p>He then raised his head, and making a motion with his hand,</p>
               <p>"Foy," he said, "a moment yet before we commence."</p>
               <p>"Certainly, sir."</p>
               <p>"Is your secretaryship the obstacle in the way of that friendly little affair I
                  proposed?"</p>
               <p>"Yes sir."</p>
               <p>"I offered you five hundred pounds to resign, did I not?"</p>
               <p>"I believe so, sir."</p>
               <p>"And you refused?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"You still refuse?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"Well, I offer you a thousand!"</p>
               <p>"Captain Waters," said the secretary, smiling grimly, "if you proceed any further
                  you will make me laugh, and as laughter, upon an occasion like the present, is not
                  becoming, I must beg you to desist. I regret extremely that 't is not in my power
                  to resign my commission in his Excellency's service at the present time. If,
                  however, that event occurs, I shall most assuredly inform you, and willingly
                  permit you to take advantage of it in the way you propose."</p>
               <p>Captain Foy bowed as he spoke, and indicated that he was ready.</p>
               <p>Waters shook his head.</p>
               <p>"My dear comrade," he said, sighing, "that was always your way. You talk so
                  eloquently, and turn your periods with such melodious art, that a poor camp devil
                  like myself, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">morbleu,</foreign> can't answer you, and 's
                  obliged to yield. I will, therefore, say no more, except that I most thankfully
                  accept your offer, and will, on the proper occasion, gladly avail myself of
                  it."</p>
               <p>And turning to hand Mr. St. John his sword, Captain Waters muttered to
                  himself,</p>
               <p>"Ah, rascal! ah, rascally second of a rascally principal, if faces do n't deceive
                  me! I'll yet split your forked tongue<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6146-00000137"/>
                  still wider, and pull your fangs, and stop you forefinger and thumb from writing
                  instructions for Conolly!"</p>
               <p>"What did you say, my dear captain?" asked Foy.</p>
               <p>"I observed, my dear friend, that it was a charming morning, and that I was filled
                  with happiness at meeting again, on this congenial occasion, with a comrade for
                  whom I have so great an affection as yourself. I foresee, if we ever kill each
                  other 't will be from a pure love of art, not from bad blood, and so, if you
                  choose, we'll proceed."</p>
               <p>With these words, accompanied by the most agreeable smiles, Captain Waters went to
                  the side of his friend, who was calmly looking forth upon the beautiful river, and
                  signified to him that every preliminary of the combat was now arranged.</p>
               <p>The young man coolly took his weapon, and leaned the point upon his boot.</p>
               <p>"All 's ready, my dear St. John," the captain said, "and I have only to add a
                  word. Lindon is as fresh as a lark; he 's taken perfect care of himself, and,
                  therefore, I advise you not to stand on the defensive with a view to weary him.
                  Better lunge from the first, and I think, from the way he carries his elbow, your
                  best lunge will be in carte."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, captain," said St. John; "I shall simply endeavor to protect myself,
                  having not the least desire to shed this gentleman's blood. If that is necessary,
                  however, I shall not hesitate, having been forced into the whole affair, and being
                  quite at my ease."</p>
               <p>The captain's countenance filled with pleasure.</p>
               <p>"My dear St. John," he said, "you will kill him! I know you will! I compliment
                  you!"</p>
               <p>"Why, captain?"</p>
               <p>"You are cool as ice, and now let us get to business."</p>
               <p>Captain Foy signified at the same moment that Mr. Lindon was ready, and the
                  opponents confronted each other.</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen," said Captain Waters, "we now permit you to proceed, unless the party
                  from whom the insult, on this occasion, has issued, shall make full and ample
                  apology for the same, retracting the said insult, and entreating pardon of his
                  opponent."</p>
               <p>Lindon made a haughty movement, but Captain Foy answered for him.</p>
               <p>"It is with great regret that we must decline such apology," said the secretary;
                  "unfortunately there is no possibility of any such thing."</p>
               <p>"You persist?" said Captain Waters.</p>
               <p>"We have the honor," said Captain Foy.</p>
               <p>"Well then the affair will, of course, proceed. There is absolutely no
                  alternative. This affair, gentlemen, as I need scarcely say, has arisen from a
                  difference of opinion upon the quality of the Canary supplied to the late
                  assembly, Mr. St. John having declared the said Canary wretched, and unworthy to
                  be drunk by a gentleman, Mr. Lindon having taken the opposite view, and offered
                  Mr. St. John a glass, which that gentleman declined. I confess I see no means of
                  bringing about a community of sentiment but the sword, and so, Captain Foy, we are
                  ready!"</p>
               <p>"And we, sir—proceed, gentlemen!"</p>
               <p>The two men raised their swords quickly, and the weapons crossed.</p>
               <p>The seconds retired ten paces and looked on.</p>
               <p>Lindon was perfectly fresh, and, as his sword touched his opponent's, his eyes
                  flashed with gratified hatred.</p>
               <p>St. John was perfectly calm and cool.</p>
               <p>Lindon advanced furiously and made a mortal thrust at his opponent, which was
                  parried perfectly.</p>
               <p>The next moment they closed in a violent, deadly, breast-to-breast struggle, the
                  swords glittering in what seemed in extricable confusion, but really the
                  perfection of skill and method.</p>
               <p>Both the seconds advanced at once, crying "Gentlemen! gentlemen!"</p>
               <p>The combatants stopped and drew back—Lindon pale with rage, St. John growing
                  gradually hot.</p>
               <pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6146-00000138"/>
               <p>"Gentlemen!" said Captain Waters, with affecting earnestness, "you really move me
                  to the heart, and wound my sense of propriety cruelly, in which I am sure I also
                  utter the sentiments of my friend, Captain Foy! In Heaven's name do n't make a
                  dagger fight of an honorable encounter with swords before seconds! Let us commence
                  again, gentlemen, and spare our feelings, I beseech you."</p>
               <p>The captain was evidently greatly affected as he spoke, and Foy said,</p>
               <p>"I beg, gentlemen, that you will observe the suggestion of Captain Waters. It is
                  no less just than feelingly expressed."</p>
               <p>The two men, whose blood was completely aroused, waited with impatience for the
                  signal to proceed.</p>
               <p>The word was given, and they threw themselves upon each other with the ferocity of
                  tigers.</p>
               <p>Lindon made his former lunge with a fury which indicated the height of his rage.
                  St. John again parried it perfectly.</p>
               <p>For ten minutes then they fought, not like two civilized men opposed to each
                  other, but like blood-thirsty gladiators on the arena, in a mortal combat.</p>
               <p>The two men were as nearly matched as possible, and the incessant clash of the
                  weapons, from which darted flashes like lightning, proved the immense skill and
                  strength of the enemies.</p>
               <p>Suddenly St. John struck his foot against a stone, and thrown off his guard for an
                  instant, could not parry the furious lunge of his opponent.</p>
               <p>The point of Lindon's sword appeared streaming with blood behind the young man's
                  back, and at the same instant his own weapon was buried in his enemy's
                  shoulder.</p>
               <p>Lindon's weapon broke at the hilt, and the two combattants fell, dragging each
                  other to the ground.</p>
               <p>The seconds ran and pulled them asunder, and raised them to their feet.</p>
               <p>Leaning on the shoulders of Captain Waters and Captain Foy, the two men gazed at
                  each other with flashing eyes and crimson cheeks, breathing heavily, and clutching
                  at their weapons.</p>
               <p>"Your sword! Give me your sword, Captain Foy," cried Lindon, faintly, "I'll finish
                  him!"</p>
               <p>Foy's hand moved to his weapon.</p>
               <p>"Captain Foy," said Waters, "if you hand that weapon to your principal I'll run
                  you through the body, and him too, upon my honor!"</p>
               <p>"Let him have it!" said St. John, hoarsely, his breast streaming with blood. "Your
                  sword, sir!"</p>
               <p>"He shall not!" cried Captain Waters, "'t is three inches longer than yours."</p>
               <p>Foy moved to draw the weapon.</p>
               <p>"Well comrade!" said Waters, "if that 's the use you 're going to make of it,
                  nothing could delight me more! I have been pleading for the favor. Captain Foy, I
                  have the honor to salute you and to place myself entirely at your orders!"</p>
               <p>With these cold words, Captain Waters drew his sword and confronted his
                  opponent.</p>
               <p>Foy's hand left the hilt of the weapon, and a keen flash of his proud eye showed
                  how reluctantly he yielded.</p>
               <p>"No sir," he said, coldly, "there shall be no need of the encounter you propose. I
                  recognize the propriety of your objection to the further progress of this affair,
                  and I agree with you that it is, for the present, at an end."</p>
               <p>As he spoke, Captain Foy turned to Lindon, who was deadly pale, and staunched the
                  deep wound in his shoulder with his white handkerchief, which he bound round
                  it.</p>
               <p>He then assisted Lindon, who could scarcely stand alone, to his carriage, and
                  turning to bow to Captain Waters, ordered the driver to drive to Williamsburg.</p>
               <p>Captain Waters then gave his whole attention to St. John.</p>
               <p>The young man had stretched out his hand and plucked a little white rose from a
                  sweet briar, rustling in the river<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6146-00000139"/>
                  breeze—just such an one as Bonnybel had pulled to pieces on that morning—and
                  looking now at the flower, he seemed to think of the girl.</p>
               <p>"What are you doing there, comrade?" said the soldier, "what is that?"</p>
               <p>"Only a flower, captain," he said faintly.</p>
               <p>"A flower!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, a rose, and here is another—a red one."</p>
               <p>With which St. John endeavored to point to the circular blood-stain, gradually
                  extending upon his white linen bosom.</p>
               <p>As he spoke, the captain felt the young man's form weigh heavily upon his arm; and
                  the head fell like a wounded bird's.</p>
               <p>He had fainted.</p>
               <p>Captain Waters was one of those men who act promptly. He took the young man in his
                  arms, and carrying him like a child, to the edge of the stream, deluged his
                  forehead with the cool water.</p>
               <p>He then laid the pale form upon the green sward, and tearing violently away the
                  frill at his own breast, proceeded to bare the bosom of the wounded man, and probe
                  the wound.</p>
               <p>Lindon's sword had struck upon a letter, written on thick Bath post, and thus
                  diverted from its point blank direction toward the heart, had traversed the flesh
                  and muscles completely through to the back.</p>
               <p>The wound was more painful than dangerous, except from the profuse flow of
                  blood.</p>
               <p>Captain Waters bound it up with the rapidity and skill of an experienced hand, and
                  St. John opened his eyes.</p>
               <p>"How do you feel now, comrade?" said the soldier, kneeling, and holding up the
                  young man's head.</p>
               <p>"A little faint," was the reply. "Where am I, captain?"</p>
               <p>"You are on the grass, companion, with a bad flesh-wound, which talking makes
                  worse; and the motion of the carriage will be worse still for it, <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">morbleu!</foreign> Miserable day that it is!"</p>
               <p>And the soldier groaned.</p>
               <p>The young man pointed with his finger to the stream.</p>
               <p>The captain looked, and saw a sail-boat passing.</p>
               <p>"I will—go—to Flower of Hundreds—captain," said St. John, faintly.</p>
               <p>The soldier gently deposited his burden upon the sward again, and hastening to the
                  point of the island running out into the stream, hailed the boatman.</p>
               <p>In fifteen minutes the young man was being borne in the little bark toward Flower
                  of Hundreds, his head supported upon the breast of Captain Waters.</p>
               <p>He still held the small, white flower in his hand, and Bonnybel's letter had not
                  left his breast.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE NEWS REACHES VANELY.</head>
               <p>IN the old drawing-room at Vanely, through whose open windows a fresh breeze wafts
                  in an odor of green leaves, and flowers, and fruit trees, full of perfumed
                  blossoms, sit the young ladies of the family, busily engaged on some ornamental
                  work, and in entertaining Mr. Alston and a certain Mr. Hamilton.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hamilton is a rubicund widower who has come—he says—to see Colonel Vane on
                  business; but not finding that gentleman at home, is disconsolate, and is
                  compelled to talk with Miss Seraphina. He calls frequently "on business with
                  Colonel Vane."</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston does not mask his designs with any such plea—he does not conceal the
                  fact that he has come "to shake the tree," or in other words, to pay his addresses
                  to Miss Helen, who seems far from being offended by it.</p>

               <p>For the moment, however, honest Tom is talking with Miss Bonnybel. He leans over
                  her, and says, with a gentle smile,</p>
               <p>"Pray what enchanting little affair is that, Miss Bonnybel? The wedding dress of a
                  fairy princess?"</p>
               <p>Bonnybel appears, of late, to have lost much of her old vivacity. She scarcely
                  smiles as she replies:</p>
               <p>"It is only a cuff. I thought I would make them myself instead of giving them to
                  Miss Carne."</p>
               <p>"Miss Carne? pray who is that?"</p>
               <p>"I forgot—you 've not seen her. She 's a seamstress whom we brought from town with
                  us. There she is at the door."</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston turns his head and makes a slight movement, as he sees before him the
                  remarkable head. Miss Carne is an Italian-looking woman, with a brunette
                  complexion, black hair, and deep, penetrating eyes. She is undeniably handsome,
                  standing in her submissive attitude with folded hands; but there is something
                  repelling in her air and appearance.</p>
               <p>"Have you laid out the pieces, Miss?" she said, with a slight Italian accent; "I
                  am ready to go on with the dress."</p>
               <p>Bonnybel gave her some directions, and she disappeared as she came, without
                  noise.</p>
               <p>"A singular face," said Mr. Alston, "but I do not like it. She is undoubtedly
                  beautiful, but not prepossessing. Well, that is scarcely a matter of importance.
                  Pray whose is this delightfully perfumed epistle?" adds Mr. Alston, smiling, and
                  raising, as he does so, from the table an embossed paper.</p>
               <p>"'T is Aunt Seraphina's verses," says Helen, smiling demurely; "ask her to let you
                  read them."</p>
               <p>"Coming from such a source, they must be indeed perfect," says the gallant Jack
                  Hamilton, with an ogle.</p>
               <p>In spite of Miss Seraphina's objections, Mr. Alston reads aloud,<q>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Bravo!" cried honest Jack; "I have rarely heard such verses! Permit me, my dear
                  Miss Seraphina, to have them put in the 'Gazette.'"</p>
               <p>"O, I never could consent," murmurs Miss Seraphina, in confusion.</p>
               <p>"Genius must be treated with gentle force, my dear madam," says Mr. Hamilton; "I
                  'll strike out the words, 'to all at Vanely," and all the colony shall admire
                  you.'</p>
               <p>That the gentleman carried out his threat is proved from the fact that we have
                  taken the verses from the old "Virginia Gazette."</p>
               <p>The conversation then turns on a number of things, and finally, at the request of
                  Tom Alston, Bonnybel goes reluctantly to the harpsichord and sings. The song is
                  "Katherine Ogie," and the young lady sings it with deep sadness. It sighs itself
                  away, and she returns listlessly to her seat.</p>
               <p>"An exquisite tune," says Mr. Alston, "and 't is Harry's great favorite. By the
                  bye, Miss Bonnybel, where is Harry?"</p>
               <p>"I really do not know, sir," is the reply; "in town, I suppose, where we left him,
                  or rather he left us."</p>
               <p>And Bonnybel's sadness changes to a pout.</p>
               <p>"Harry's not in town, my child," says the voice of Colonel<pb n="280-281"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000141"/> Vane, behind them, "and I 'm sorry to say that his
                  life is in danger."</p>
               <p>Bonnybel rose to her feet with a start, turning pale as death, but instantly fell
                  again in the chair.</p>
               <p>"He is at 'Flower of Hundreds,'" continued the colonel, sorrowfully, "and he was
                  brought thither yesterday, by Captain Waters, in one of the sail-boats. The
                  account is, that the boatman was hailed by Captain Waters, at Jamestown, and going
                  ashore found Harry lying on the grass, bleeding from a wound in the breast. I know
                  who 's to blame for it!" added the colonel, flushing, "and if the boy dies, I'll
                  pursue him to the end of the earth!"</p>
               <p>He was diverted from his wrath by a sudden exclamation from Helen. Bonnybel had
                  caught her sister's arm, to prevent herself from fainting. In a few minutes she
                  was weeping in her chamber, in the arms of Helen, who cried with her.</p>
               <p>She heard the two gentlemen mount their horses hastily, and ride away at full
                  gallop, and then the chariot rolled up to the door.</p>
               <p>"O, I'll go too!" cried Bonnybel, starting up. "I would die of suspense here!
                  Come, sister!"</p>
               <p>And breaking away from Helen, she hastily descended, just as the colonel and Aunt
                  Mabel were entering the coach. Helen followed, and they soon reached "Flower of
                  Hundreds."</p>
               <p>The colonel and Aunt Mabel went to St. John's chamber, the young ladies remaining
                  in the sitting-room. Bonnybel resembled a statue; she did not move or speak, but,
                  from time to time, her vacant eyes were raised to the pictures they had looked
                  upon together.</p>
               <p>As the slow step of the colonel was heard descending the stairs, she started, her
                  cheeks flushed—she rose, and hastened to the door.</p>
               <p>"How is he?" she said, in a low tone.</p>
               <p>"Badly hurt, but not dangerously," returned the colonel; "the wound was got in a
                  duel with that man Lindon, at Jamestown island; the letter which you wrote, my
                  child, before the assembly, turned the weapon, and, in all probability, saved his
                  life. The doctor and his friends are now with him, and they think that a month's
                  confinement will be all."</p>
               <p>Bonnybel drew a long, labored breath, went slowly to the window, looking forth on
                  the river, and there she remained without turning her head.</p>
               <p>She was crying like a child, but they were tears of joy.</p>

               <head type="sub">TWO HEARTS.</head>
               <p>ST. JOHN had a vigorous constitution, and his wound soon ceased to make him suffer
                  acutely. The doctor directed entire quiescence for some time, however, and thus
                  the young man was confined to his room and his bed still.</p>
               <p>It was a great favor, which he at last obtained, to be permitted to rise, and lie,
                  in his dressing gown, on a couch in the drawing-room, and while Lindon was still
                  turning and tossing with fever, in his close quarters in town, St. John was
                  inhaling the breath of leaves and flowers.</p>
               <p>Many friends flocked to cheer his hours of weariness, and we need not say that the
                  Vanely family were not remiss.</p>
               <p>Tom Alston assumed his most foppish air to make him laugh; Jack Hamilton told a
                  hundred stories of fox hunting and frolicking; Captain Waters related endless
                  anecdotes of his campaigns. With shoulders drooping, and dreamy looking eyes, as
                  he thrummed on his chair, the worthy soldier recalled, for his companion's
                  amusement, a thousand tales and remembrances. He made his brilliant and joyous
                  youth rise again; he beat, or was beaten again by the French; he fought all his
                  battles over with sighs or careless laughter.</p>
               <pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6146-00000142"/>
               <p>But of all the friendly and sympathizing faces which gathered round him, during
                  those long hours of suffering and weakness, there was one which contributed more
                  powerfully to the young man's recovery than all the rest.</p>
               <p>We need scarcely say that this was the face of Bonnybel.</p>
               <p>Claiming her privilege of cousin and old playmate, the young lady, throwing aside
                  all ceremony, came almost daily, with her mother and sisters, to see the invalid,
                  and St. John experienced in her society a charm which seemed to make him stronger
                  day by day, as though by the influence of magic.</p>
               <p>Bonnybel was no longer the coquettish and mischievous little fairy, such as we
                  have seen her in former pages of this history. She appeared suddenly to have
                  changed her entire character. She no longer laughed and jested at every thing and
                  nothing. All the little pouts, and "spites," and ironies, and angers, which had
                  made her society so piquante, disappeared. She became suddenly an earnest woman,
                  full of pity and sympathizing tenderness, and very soon a critical observer might
                  have seen, dawning in her eyes, and on her tell-tale cheeks, the evidences of a
                  warmer and more profound emotion—the imperceptible light, and rosy dawn, of a true
                  woman's faithful love.</p>
               <p>They spent hours and hours together, beneath the open window, through which came
                  the breath of vernal fields and summer flowers, and Bonnybel seemed never weary
                  gazing at the fine landscape. From the lofty hill, the wooded banks of the great
                  river, studded with white mansions, embowered in green foliage, stretched far
                  away, and disappeared in the mists of the horizon; the broad current glittered
                  with the snowy sails of sea-bound barks or those returning home from distant
                  lands; the forests, day by day, assumed a deeper and more beautiful emerald; the
                  summer came apace, completing with its warmth and fuller radiance, the influence
                  of the fresh spring, and in the heart of the young lady, also, all those vague
                  emotions of the past came gradually to combine and ripen into the warm summer of
                  love.</p>
               <p>It is out of our power to trace, with greater distinctness, the successive steps
                  by which the girl approached this supreme point in the life of a woman. We would
                  not, if we could. Such topics should not be lightly handled. A poet says: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Two happier lovers never met</l>

                        <l>The memories of happier hours</l>
                        <l>Are like the cordials pressed from flowers</l>

                        <l>And love's own sanctities forbid,</l>
                        <l>Now, as of old, such gossippings</l>
                        <l>In halls, of what befalls in bowers."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>We prefer to simply state the fact that the result of those hours of quiet talk,
                  or more expressive silence, was an affection, on the part of the young lady, as
                  warm and true as that of her lover. Doubtless it commenced in her woman's pity for
                  suffering, and tender sympathy for him who suffered, but ere long this sympathy
                  was needless, for he grew stronger day by day; still the feeling of the young lady
                  deepened.</p>
               <p>No word had been spoken by either, but the language of the eyes is superior to all
                  words. All around them soon perceived what they thought so wholly concealed, and
                  by a series of <emph>accidents,</emph> Mr. St. John's visitors were all called
                  away when Bonnybel came to see him. They would talk alone for hours, the fresh
                  breeze moving her bright curls, or bringing back the color to his pale thin
                  cheeks, and then they would part with a long look, which needed no words to
                  express its meaning.</p>
               <p>It was one evening when, having arisen from his sick couch, and received
                  permission to ride out, St. John went with Bonnybel to Vanely, that he found the
                  moment.</p>
               <pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6146-00000143"/>
               <p>It was a lovely evening, and the sun was just setting, as they drew near the old
                  hall. In the east, a luminous halo preceded the rising of the moon, and a single
                  star, suspended, like a lamp of fire, in the rosy atmosphere, delicately
                  scintillated, gathering clearer radiance as the purple margin of the sunset grew
                  more pale.</p>
               <p>In a moment, the two hearts beat together; he understood what had angered and
                  pained him so much; she had loved him and expected him to return; her suffering
                  had been greater than his own.</p>
               <p>They reached the old hall, and now, when the pale, weak young man assisted her
                  from the saddle, she did not pout or reprimand him.</p>
               <p>The curious moon, looking down, saw a man holding closely to his breast a woman—a
                  woman who smiled through her tears—that was all.</p>
               <p>They had plighted their troth.</p>

               <head type="sub">WHICH COMMENCES THE SECOND PORTION OF THE HISTORY.</head>
               <p>WITH the words which we have just written, we should be glad to conclude our
                  history. The young and kind-hearted, everywhere, would thank us, for, to this
                  class, nothing is so pleasant as happiness and sunshine. St. John would be
                  remembered as one happy in the possession of a true-hearted woman; Bonnybel, as
                  the bride of the man whom she preferred, above all the world, for her husband.</p>
               <p>But, alas! human life is not made up entirely of sunshine. It is often when the
                  day is brightest, that the dark folds of the thunder cloud sweep from the horizon,
                  and blacken the most brilliant landscape. It was so in the lives of these lovers,
                  and the duty of their historian is to tell all he knows.</p>
               <p>In some points of view, perhaps, this duty is of advantage to the history. For
                  this volume has two themes, two aims: the story of a man and a woman; the history,
                  also, of a period in the annals of a nation.</p>
               <p>We have followed the steps of these two persons toward the point where their hands
                  clasped; we have witnessed the gradual narrowing of the space which separated two
                  lands from the battle-field, where hearts, long united, would be torn asunder,
                  where squadrons would clash, and blood flow like water. Let us now look again on
                  the columns marching to the conflict, from which a new world was to rise, like a
                  colossal form of Victory, its face to the morning and the stars of glory on its
                  brow. Let us also see what befell the two main personages of the history. There
                  are clouds and sunshine in both pictures.</p>
               <p>For a month, St. John was wholly and completely happy. If, before, the whole world
                  appeared brighter and lovelier in his eyes, it was now wholly transfigured, for he
                  was blessed with the fruition of his dearest wish. Like the sun shining out after
                  a storm, his present joy was more fresh and brilliant for the hours of gloom which
                  had preceded it. The woman whom he loved, loved him in return, and every one at
                  Vanely sincerely rejoiced. The young man had twined himself around the hearts of
                  old and young, and the parents of the young lady hailed with joy the closer bond
                  which was about to unite them to the young man; he had been like a son always to
                  them, now he would be really such.</p>
               <p>Bonnybel bore her "new honors" with some blushes, but a serene, tranquil
                  happiness. All her wildness and mischief had departed; she no longer laughed or
                  jested; she was content to be silent and happy.</p>
               <p>It was arranged that the marriage should take place at the end of summer, and the
                  young lady and her companion had a hundred confidential talks on the arrangements
                  which that event would make necessary. It was at last decided that, after a month
                  spent at Vanely, they should go to "Flower of Hundreds," and settle down
                  permanently; thus<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6146-00000144"/> Mr. St. John would be
                  what he wished to be, an honest country gentleman. He would cultivate his
                  patrimonial acres, and never dream of Indians or war any more!</p>
               <p>His old ambition seemed to him, as he pondered and smiled now, like a dream of the
                  night, a mere foolish fancy. Indians? That they should concern him was supremely
                  ridiculous! He had other things to think of—his wife!</p>
               <p>Thus a month fled away, and one morning the young man mounted "Tallyho" to go to
                  Williamsburg, where he had to attend to some pecuniary matters, and see to having
                  the old house of "Flower of Hundreds" refitted for the abode of its future
                  mistress.</p>
               <p>"Are you sure you'll not forget me?" said Bonnybel, archly, and blushing, as he
                  bade her farewell; "a whole week! what a long, long time!"</p>
               <p>"It is a century to me," he replied, gazing with pride and admiration on the girl;
                  "but I'll try not to forget you, if you will promise me as much."</p>
               <p>The foollish, idle thought was not worth replying to, she said, smiling; he would
                  write to her?</p>
               <p>"Every day—could she think he would neglect it?"</p>
               <p>And with a heavy heart the young man vaulted into the saddle. "Tallyho" departed
                  at a gallop, but his master did not see the road before him. His head was turned
                  backward, his eyes fixed on a woman, who waved her white handkerchief; at last the
                  forest intervened; they were parted for the first time since that moonlit
                  evening.</p>
               <p>Let us now leave the happy fields of Vanely, and its cheerful faces, and following
                  St. John, reënter the old capital. From this center and heart flows already the
                  fiery blood of revolution; here, also, fell that cloud, which we have spoken of,
                  on the young man who thought his life all sunshine.</p>
               <p>It was the afternoon of the first of August when St. John rode into Williamsburg
                  and stopped at the Raleigh tavern.</p>
               <p>As he approached the door, a concourse of gentlemen were issuing forth, and he
                  recognized the members of the House of Burgesses, which Dunmore had dissolved more
                  than two months before.</p>
               <p>Suddenly he saw, in front of him, the stranger of the old church at Richmond.</p>
               <p>The stranger was talking with one of the members, but his clear, penetrating eye
                  having caught sight of St. John, he ended his colloquy and approached the young
                  man.</p>
               <p>"Welcome, friend," he said, in his deep, calm voice; "I have not seen you of late,
                  as was very natural. You have recovered?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, perfectly. So you knew of my accident?"</p>
               <p>"Of course; the whole province knows it. Your adversary has just gotten out
                  again."</p>
               <p>"Well, I 'm glad of that, and accounts are closed, I think, between us. But this
                  meeting, this assemblage!"</p>
               <p>"It is the first Virginia Convention. You arrive too late."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry, but I can at least compliment you on your foresight. This is the
                  second prediction which you made; both, I see, are now accomplished."</p>
               <p>"My prediction?" said the stranger; "it was scarcely such. Prophets are inspired,
                  and speak from their inspiration. I was simply informed in advance. I have an
                  advantage over you. To the uneducated eye of the mere looker on, Virginia advances
                  blindly, and without knowing what she does; to me, as to those who know, her whole
                  career is the result of a logical, mathematical set of premises; the
                  accomplishment, in open day, of what Henry and the great leaders have resolved on
                  in council."<ref rend="super" target="#note_035" xml:id="return_035">*</ref>

               <p>"Ah, I understand!"</p>
               <p>"This was to do—it is done," continued the stranger; "the sword was drawn, the
                  blow has now been struck. Do you know what the blow is?"</p>
               <p>"Tell me."</p>
               <p>"This convention of delegates, elected by the people of Virginia, has just
                  affirmed the action of the House, making common cause with the people of Boston to
                  the very death,<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6146-00000145"/> and breaking off wholly
                  all commercial connection with England."</p>
               <p>"That is well."</p>
               <p>"What remains is better. Do you remember that the articles of association, on the
                  occasion of the dissolution, recommended a general congress?"</p>
               <p>"I remember."</p>
               <p>"Well, that congress is now resolved on. Delegates have just been appointed:
                  Peyton Randolph, Richard Henry Lee, George Washington, Patrick Henry, Richard
                  Bland, Benjamin Harrison, and Edmund Pendleton."</p>
               <p>"A noble array of names."</p>
               <p>"A constellation of glory and victory!" said the stranger, in his deep, earnest
                  voice; "our Virginia noblemen, by God's patent, not the king's! Do you know the
                  instructions they carry in their hands? Listen to the ending—I have it by heart:
                  'If the said General Gage conceives he is empowered to act in this manner, as the
                  commander-in-chief of his Majesty's forces in America, this odious and illegal
                  proclamation must be considered as a plain and full declaration that this despotic
                  viceroy will be bound by no law, nor regard the constitutional rights of his
                  Majesty's subjects whenever they interfere with the plans he has formed for
                  oppressing the good people of Massachusetts Bay, and, therefore, the executing, or
                  attempting to execute, such proclamation will justify resistance and reprisal.'
                  This is what the delegates of Virginia take to the general continental congress,
                  to meet in Philadelphia on the 5th of September, and it is enough! No matter
                  whether 't is General Gage, or the government represented by him, which we are to
                  resist and execute reprisals on! I defy a million casuists to change the issue
                  when the cannon begin to roar!"</p>
               <p>"You are right," said St. John, thoughtfully, "it is really England which these
                  instructions defy."</p>
               <p>"Nothing less," replied the stranger, opening a pamphlet which he carried folded
                  in his hand, "and here is the defiance at greater length."</p>
               <p>"What is that?"</p>
               <p>"See! '<hi rend="i"/>A Summary View of the Rights of British America.'"</p>
               <p>"By whom?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Thomas Jefferson."</p>
               <p>"Ah! the man of the mathematical logic, the irreverent genius, the
                  overturner!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, the pick-ax, as Henry is the gunpowder. Take this pamphlet and read it,
                  friend. See its noble sentiments: 'the whole art of government consists in the art
                  of being honest!' Weigh attentively its inexorable logic, treading upon thrones
                  and principalities! See how I uttered the simplest truth when I told you that this
                  man, Jefferson, would be one of the eagles of the storm! In this pamphlet, which
                  will probably cause his attainder for treason, the great issue is defined with
                  irresistible vigor and unflinching exactness; these pages are the statement of the
                  quarrel, the watch-word of resistance—revolution!<ref rend="super"
                     target="#note_036" xml:id="return_036">*</ref> Every moment that revolution
                  advances! We have looked for it almost with tears and groans! Now it comes, with
                  gigantic strides, as I speak! Ten years ago, Patrick Henry said to me: 'Even now
                  you may scent the odor of the coming storm!' Well, friend, that odor gathers
                  closer and more intense, but it is not suffocating! It fills the veins of
                  thousands with fierce heat—of thousands who are taking down their old swords and
                  fire-arms. The gloomy cloud droops above, and the world lies in darkness, but
                  wait, friend, wait! be not doubtful! From this gloom will leap the lightning of an
                  oppressed people's indignation; woe to those who are struck by the bolt!"</p>

               <p>"You speak in a voice which leaves no room for answer," said his companion. "I
                  will take this pamphlet and read it; but I fear I shall be a worthless
                  proselyte."</p>
               <p>"No, you belong to Virginia, and will take your part."</p>
               <p>St. John smiled.</p>
               <p>"Do you know why I think I shall not accomplish much, friend?" he said.</p>
               <pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6146-00000146"/>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"I am happy."</p>
               <p>And the young man's eyes wandered, with a tranquil light in them, toward the far
                  south-west.</p>
               <p>"You have been frank with me, friend," he said to the stranger; "you unrolled
                  before me your whole past life—I will not be so unfriendly as to conceal my own. I
                  love and am beloved by the noblest woman in the land, and in her love I find the
                  consummation of my hopes and dreams. Do you understand now why I am a bad
                  instrument of revolution?"</p>
               <p>And the young man looked at the stranger with an air of tranquil happiness.</p>
               <p>The stranger for a time did not speak, but gazing at his companion, seemed to muse
                  sadly. This expression of sadness deepened into sorrow as he reflected, and at
                  last, shaking his head, he muttered,</p>
               <p>"Youth! youth! what a grand thing it is! how full of trust!"</p>
               <p>"What did you say?" asked St. John; "speak out your thoughts."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I had better not, friend,"said the stranger, sadly; "they are not happy
                  thoughts."</p>
               <p>"Let me share at least your griefs."</p>
               <p>"I have none, and I only mused, as do all men who have seen wither and fade the
                  blossoms and flowers of their dreams."</p>
               <p>"Speak, friend!" said St. John, "I wish to hear your thought."</p>
               <p>"It will not appear rational to you, but I may as well utter it. Well, you think
                  the future is clear and happy, do you not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"That you are assured of this happiness—certain to reap?"</p>
               <p>"I think I am."</p>
               <p>"You think that no clouds can rise, no thunderbolts descend?"</p>
               <p>"No clouds which love can not dissipate, no thunderbolts which happiness will not
                  turn aside."</p>
               <p>The stranger shook his head.</p>
               <p>"I thought so once, too," he muttered, "but it came. Take care! be not too
                  certain! Do not think that Heaven will permit you to withdraw yourself from the
                  contest."</p>
               <p>St. John smiled.</p>
               <p>"You speak to a man demented by a possessing thought, a single image," he said;
                  "your words do not convince me."</p>
               <p>"Well, perhaps they had better have not been uttered. But the future is dark—we
                  know not what may happen. I see that for the present I have lost a coadjutor, for
                  you are happy and content. If that happiness changes to sadness, that content to
                  suffering and pain, then you will come back to the struggle from which you are now
                  taken. If that event happens, come and put your hand on my shoulder—I will support
                  you. My words seem idle, friend, but they may be the best rationality for you if
                  the darkness comes. Do you see that tall house yonder rising above the suburbs?
                  That is my working place, you know, and there you will find me! I hope you will
                  not come. I trust I may be a mere raven, like Virgil's, croaking from the hollow
                  tree; but the future for all of us lies in the hand of God. Now I will take my
                  leave, as I have much to attend to. I shall see you again."</p>
               <p>And exchanging a grasp of the hand with St. John, the stranger left him, and
                  disappeared in the moving throng before the door of the tavern.</p>
               <p>The young man looked after him with a sad smile.</p>
               <p>"There goes one who has suffered much," he muttered, "and he fears that I will
                  suffer. He does not know the depth and security of my happiness, poor heart! He
                  does not know that Bonnybel and myself are united by a tie which destiny itself is
                  powerless to burst asunder!"</p>
               <p>He spoke with a smile, and so went into the Raleigh.</p>

               <head type="sub">HOW CAPTAIN WATERS PLUCKED ALL HIS GEESE.</head>
               <p>IT was on the afternoon of the next day that St. John, while going along with his
                  head bent down, struck suddenly against an object approaching, as he was leaving,
                  the Raleigh tavern.</p>
               <p>He raised his head and found that the object was Captain Waters, who had been
                  going along in the same thoughtful way.</p>
               <p>There was this difference, however, between the musings of the friends; those of
                  St. John were happy, while Captain Ralph was evidently sad.</p>
               <p>"I 'm delighted to see you, my dear captain," said St. John, holding out his hand,
                  "and must beg your pardon for nearly knocking you down. What news?"</p>
               <p>The captain pressed his friend's hand with melancholy pleasure, and with a
                  countenance elongated to an extent really deplorable, replied, sadly,</p>
               <p>"Absolutely nothing, my dear comrade, unless you call the convention here, and a
                  dreadful disappointment I have suffered, news."</p>
               <p>"A dreadful disappointment!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my friend, nothing less," groaned the captain, "a real staggerer."</p>
               <p>"You pain me," said St. John, scanning the mortified face of his companion; "come,
                  be friendly, and tell me your trouble as I told you mine. Perhaps I can serve you
                  as you served me."</p>
               <p>The captain shook his head.</p>
               <p>"Impossible, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami,</foreign>" he groaned, "actually
                  impossible. <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Morbleu!</foreign> how black that sunshine
                  is!"</p>
               <p>And the captain drew down the corners of his mouth, and, consequently, the
                  midnight fringe which covered them, in a way which indicated actual despair.</p>
               <p>"You look at me curiously, my boy," he said, after a moment; "you lament my
                  distress. You will lament it more when I tell you about it, and will see that you
                  can't relieve it. I succeeded tolerably well in hatching that little affair
                  between you and Lindon, who is just getting out again, but you can not reciprocate
                  the favor. It has some relation to that little circumstance at Jamestown island,
                  but the similarity soon ends. You can't help me, miserable wretch that I am! You
                  can not be of the least service to me!"</p>
               <p>And the captain groaned again. This time he almost sobbed.</p>
               <p>"I see you are dying to hear about it, comrade," he continued, after a
                  disconsolate pause, "and I do n't mind telling you every thing. But let us go and
                  get a cup of Canary—I 'm choking."</p>
               <p>With which words Captain Ralph led the way into the domain of mine host of the
                  Raleigh, and being supplied with what he demanded, drew St. John into a corner of
                  the apartment, and sitting down, proceeded to his disappointment.</p>
               <p>"Fancy me lounging yonder at home, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami,</foreign>" he
                  said, "after seeing you well through that little affair with Lindon, and behold
                  me, as the French lingo has it, idle, sombre, becoming gradually a prey to the
                  blue devils. They assaulted me even when you were sick, and that 's why I told you
                  all those adventures and wore out your patience with stories! Do n't deny it,
                  comrade, you are too polite. My own opinion is, that those narratives delayed your
                  recovery at least a fortnight! You smile—you think I 'm a <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >farceur!</foreign> My friend, I am not; I am plunged into despair. But to
                  proceed."</p>
               <p>And taking another draught of the Canary, the soldier sighed and continued.</p>
               <p>"Back to Flodden once more, as I said, companion, I became a prey to the blue
                  imps, and all day long I thought of nothing but my disappointment in the matter of
                  drawing Foy into a duel. In vain did madam, that paragon of women<pb n="294-295"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000148"/> men, endeavor to extract from me the origin of my
                  low spirits. In vain did Master Ralph Waters, that noblest of urchins, and most
                  indefatigable of dirt pie fabricators, climb up my knees, and beg for a caress. I
                  motioned Madame Henriette away—I sent Master Ralph to the nursery. Every day I
                  grew thinner, and was rapidly becoming weary of life under the ungentlemanly
                  persecution of that fellow, Foy, who has treated me abominably. You see it was his
                  refusal to fight me, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami,</foreign> which caused my
                  melancholy, and I was in despair.</p>
               <p>"Well, things were in this condition, when, one morning I read in the 'Virginia
                  Gazette,' that their honors, the delegates of the colony, would meet in convention
                  in a day or two, at Williamsburg; and no sooner had I perused this announcement
                  than a fortunate or unfortunate idea at once struck me. Foy had refused to fight
                  me on the ground of his secretaryship. Now I would place myself on an equality
                  with him, by becoming the secretary of the convention. Do n't you see? I do n't
                  mind saying I 'm rather proud of the idea, and I proceeded immediately to put it
                  into execution. I got a bundle of paper as big as a horse could carry, a fascine
                  of pens, which Madame Henriette made by reducing all the geese on the plantation
                  to a state of nature, and having thus prepared for my civil duties, the ink being
                  left to the liberality of the convention, I hunted up my best sword, and spent an
                  entire day in burnishing my accoutrements. On the next morning I set out in my
                  carriage, bidding a triumphant adieu to that paragon of women, Madame Henriette,
                  who was dying with curiosity—her only failing, my friend—and in due time I reached
                  Williamsburg."</p>
               <p>The captain stopped to sip his Canary, in the midst of smiles from Mr. St.
                  John.</p>
               <p>"I arrived just in time," continued the narrator, "and by the influence of my
                  friends, secured the post of secretary of the convention, which I, however, paid a
                  deputy, an excellent scrivener, to perform the duties of. You see, however, I was
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">de jure,</foreign> as Jack Hamilton is fond of saying,
                  the secretary retary, and I rubbed my sword again, until I could see my face in
                  it. As to the paper and quills, the deputy took them, while I went after Foy.</p>
               <p>"I called at the palace—his secretaryship was at Montebello, the residence, some
                  six miles below town, of his Excellency, the noble Dunmore. I got into the saddle,
                  and went to Montebello; his secretaryship sent me word that he was engaged in
                  important business with his lordship, and begged to be excused. You may know I
                  came back in a furious bad humor, and so I remained until this morning.</p>
               <p>"I then heard that Foy had returned, and dressing myself in this elegant suit, and
                  girding on this pretty little parade sword, I repeated my call at the palace.</p>
               <p>"I heard Foy say to the servant, 'Tell him, pest that he is! tell him I have not
                  returned!' The lackey was delivering this message when I pushed him aside, and
                  went in.</p>
               <p>"Foy was sitting at his table, the same one, I doubt not, <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >mon ami,</foreign> from behind which his Excellency scolded you, and from the
                  pile of papers before him, I suppose he was busy. We look at each other for a
                  moment, and Foy frowns. I smile and bow.</p>
               <p>"'I am really distressed to disturb you, my dear Foy,' I say, 'but you will permit
                  me to say that 't was scarcely friendly to deny yourself thus to an old
                  comrade.'</p>
               <p>"'I am busy, Captain Waters,' he replies, with a grand air.</p>
               <p>"'I thought Conolly was gone, my dear friend,' I say; for, you see, I wanted to
                  get him up to the point. Once aroused, I knew I had him.</p>
               <p>"At the words, 'I thought Conolly was gone,' his pale face flushes, as I expected,
                  and he rises and says,</p>
               <p>"'Captain Waters, this is the third or fourth time you have been pleased to
                  connect me with Major Conolly, his Excellency's agent—'</p>
               <p>"'Ah! he is his Excellency's agent,' I interrupt; 'you acknowledge it?'</p>
               <p>"'I acknowledge nothing, sir!' he says, growing hot at<pb n="296-297"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000149"/> his blunder, 'I only say that your persevering
                  intrusion upon me, and your insinuations, are insulting, offensive, and such as I
                  shall not longer endure!'</p>
               <p>"My dear St. John," continued the captain, smiling, "when Foy said that, growing
                  red as he spoke, I felt a happiness which I have not before experienced for a long
                  time. I saw that I had fortunately come on him in an irritable moment, when the
                  best of us, you know, can't keep cool, and I expected much from this
                  circumstance.</p>
               <p>"'My dear Foy,' I say, 'do you really consider that question insulting? Well, I'll
                  tell you in confidence, I meant it to be so; not in any bad spirit, for I have a
                  positive affection for you, and would not would your feelings for worlds, but, you
                  see, I have set my heart on fighting you.'</p>
               <p>"I said all this with so much good feeling, that my gentleman saw, I suppose, that
                  I uttered the truth. He sat down, coldly, and I read, in his keen eye, that he
                  felt he had all to lose and nothing to gain by the encounter, and that his best
                  revenge for my insult was to take no notice of it.</p>
               <p>"'Sir,' he said, in his grand way, 'you seem actually demented, and did I not know
                  the eccentricity of your character, I should not suffer this offense to pass
                  unanswered. I shall not so proceed, however, sir, and I request that this
                  interview may end. I have repeatedly assured you that my post of secretary, in the
                  service of his Excellency, renders it impossible for me to accept your defiance;
                  you know me perfectly well, sir, and are doubtless aware that I place much
                  restraint upon my feelings in refusing.'</p>
               <p>"'Know you! my dear Foy!' I reply, 'like the word of command! You 're as brave as
                  steel, and I offer you a little affair whereby you may prove it to these stupid
                  Virginians, persons wholly ignorant of your valorous deeds at Minden, and a
                  thousand other places.'</p>
               <p>"'I repeat, sir,' he says, coldly, 'that this duel is impossible.'</p>
               <p>"'Why? On account of your secretaryship, eh?'</p>
               <p>"'Yes, sir.'</p>
               <p>"'That makes the combat unequal?'</p>
               <p>"'It does, sir.'</p>
               <p>"'Well,' I say, triumphantly, 'suppose we stood on equal grounds, would things be
                  changed?'</p>
               <p>"'Yes, sir, and as I said before, it would give me extreme pleasure to cut your
                  throat,' replies Foy, making me the most elegantly sneering salute.</p>
               <p>"I did not notice it; I got ready my blow.</p>
               <p>"'It gives me real happiness to inform you, my dear Foy,' I say, 'that the
                  equality which you mention really exists. I am secretary of the convention of
                  Virginia, and here is a parchment evidence of it, sworn to by three witnesses—I
                  added the third for safety. This paper, my dear Foy, proves what I say, and now I
                  suppose you will no longer refuse. Come, let us make the arrangements; I 'm dying
                  to learn the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coup</foreign> of Reinfels, and if I kill
                  you, I shall bless your memory.'</p>
               <p>"My gentleman looks, with the strongest astonishment, on the paper, and says,</p>
               <p>"'Captain Waters, you seem really crazy.'</p>
               <p>"'My dear Foy,' I reply, smiling, 'you seem to me absolutely stupid.'</p>
               <p>"'Captain Waters, I shall suffer no more insults!' says my gentleman, flushing.
                  'Take back your parchment, sir, the evidence of your participation in a
                  treasonable assemblage; take it back, sir, and I advise you to destroy it.
                  Otherwise you will suffer by it when the government makes its investigations into
                  the riotous conduct of the inhabitants of the colony. I give you this advice, sir,
                  as an old companion, and I refuse to have you arrested, as I might, because we
                  have fought and slept together. Go, captain! let us proceed different ways; at
                  present, I repeat that I neither can nor will fight you, but if it is any
                  consolation, I announce to you that, in all probability, the time will soon arrive
                  when I shall show you your favorite <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coup.</foreign> I do
                  not pretend to think that we are not enemies; we are, for we espouse different<pb
                     n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6146-00000150"/> ferent sides. If you can kill me, do
                  so; when the time comes, I have good hopes of performing that ceremony for
                  yourself!'</p>
               <p>"And bowing, with an air of the most odious elegance, the confounded fellow bent
                  over his papers again. I had nothing to reply, my dear friend," finished the
                  captain. "I could not force Foy to recognize the validity of my appointment as
                  secretary, when he conscientiously doubted. I was beaten, driven back,
                  disappointed, conquered completely. I only shook my head, and bidding Foy adieu,
                  came away. At the door I met his Excellency, whom I saluted, and so I was
                  returning, sorrowfully, when I ran up against you. Miserable and detestable fate!"
                  added the captain, "which pushes me eternally away from this snake. But even in
                  the depths of my disappointment, I'll not despair. I'll yet wait for happier
                  times."</p>
               <p>The captain finished his Canary, and rose, St. John, having listened with the
                  utmost attention, and not without laughter, to his narrative.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps resignation is the best, my dear captain," he said, "and I can feel for
                  you in your distress. I have listened to your relation with much entertainment,
                  and 't is certainly another touch added to Captain Foy in my imagination. He seems
                  to me a mixture of the soldier and the diplomatist, the tiger and the lamb."</p>
               <p>"Exactly," said the captain, "that hits him to the very letter."</p>
               <p>"Well, may be his lamb's fleece will fall off and he will show his teeth. Let us
                  hope for the best!"</p>
               <p>And, laughing, St. John rose and followed the soldier to the street.</p>
               <p>As they reached the portico of the tavern, St. John saw Lindon pass, and the two
                  adversaries exchanged a ceremonious salute. On the part of St. John, this salute
                  was perfectly polite and frank; on the part of Lindon, formal and almost haughty,
                  his dark eyes glittering with a sinister expression pression in his pale, cold
                  face, as he passed on and disappeared.</p>
               <p>"There's another of the snakes, if I'm not greatly mistaken," said the captain,
                  "and I advise you to keep a good look-out when you pass dark corners. A man with
                  an eye like that can't possibly be honest, and now, my dear friend, I must return
                  home. To our next meeting!"</p>
               <p>And the friends separated—the captain to mount his horse, St. John to attend to
                  the business which brought him to Williamsburg.</p>

               </note>
               <p>ST. JOHN'S business was nothing more nor less, says our author, than some
                  pecuniary arrangements in connection with his proposed embarkation upon the seas
                  of matrimony, and the agent in these arrangements was a certain Mr. A. Z. Smith,
                  factor.</p>
               <p>We should like to pause in our narrative, and once more enter the small warehouse
                  of the worthy factor, salute the round-faced shopboy, who, as of old, presides
                  with smiles over the domain of tin pans and flitches, whips and boxes of tobacco,
                  in perennial youth. We should like to enter the little counting-room beyond, where
                  Mr. A. Z. Smith, as in old days, transacts his real business with his courtly
                  customers, and taste his rum, and see the picture of his mustachioed ancestor, and
                  admire his great ledgers chronicling the business of a lifetime. But,
                  unfortunately, Mr. A. Z. Smith, factor, is not destined to affect the current of
                  our narrative, which runs in other channels past the little shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John was with Mr. A. Z. Smith a portion of every day, and the smiling
                  little factor made him his best bows<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6146-00000151"/>
                  when he appeared, and went away; that salute of familiar respect which the wealthy
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bourgeois</foreign> bestowed at the period on one of
                  the <emph>gentry.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>After these business interviews Mr. St. John was idle for the rest of the day, and
                  one morning he thought he would take a gallop into the country for the benefit of
                  the air.</p>
               <p>He accordingly mounted Tallyho, and putting spur to that spirited animal, was soon
                  beyond the limits of the town, careering through the summer forest, in the
                  direction of Captain Ralph's.</p>
               <p>Tallyho seemed to think that the choice of the road was left to himself, and his
                  master soon found that he had diverged from the highway, and that they had arrived
                  in front of a certain mansion known as the "Trap," where resided a certain Mr.
                  Jack Hamilton.</p>
               <p>"Well," said the young man, smiling, "why not go in and see Jack? I 'm idle, and I
                  'll stop."</p>
               <p>With which words he halted and dismounted before the mansion.</p>
               <p>An old gray-haired African came, respectfully, to take the bridle of one of the
                  new generation, and this bridle was loftily relinquished by the perennial old
                  nobleman of the stables to a grotesque individual about four feet high, addressed
                  by the euphonious name of Crow.</p>
               <p>Mr. Crow still rolled in his gait, distended his large popped eyes, grinned from
                  ear to ear, and if he did not turn summersets, danced as before, with like danger
                  of trenching on the rights of his sweeping coat skirts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hamilton received his friend with great cordiality, and laughed heartily when,
                  over a bottle of claret, Mr. St. John related the interview between Captain Waters
                  and the secretary.</p>
               <p>"The fact is, my dear St. John," he said, "our friend, Waters, is a trump, and
                  sooner or later, I predict, will run the secretary through the body. Eh? Do n't
                  you think so?"</p>
               <p>"Not unlikely."</p>
               <p>"He'll do his work better than you did in the case of Lindon."</p>
               <p>"I'm very glad of the result in that case, my dear Hamilton."</p>
               <p>"Glad?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly; you see, I 'm naturally indisposed to shed blood, and I was forced
                  into that duel. I begin to think all duels folly though, and there 's the whole
                  matter."</p>
               <p>Hamilton laughed.</p>
               <p>"I understand," he said; "there 's a little angel who 's been talking to you,
                  doubtless—come, do n't blush, my boy, she certainly is an angel, and if I 'm not
                  mistaken, you wish to monopolize her."</p>
               <p>St. John stopped blushing, and smiled.</p>
               <p>"See how the world is given to scandal," he said.</p>
               <p>"Scandal," exclaimed his friend; "do you deny it?"</p>
               <p>"I will reply by asking you a question, my friend."</p>
               <p>"Ask it, Harry, my boy."</p>
               <p>"Do n't you understand the real motive of my visits to Vanely?"</p>
               <p>"I think I do," observed Mr. Hamilton, triumphantly; "you go thither in
                  order—"</p>
               <p>"To see Colonel Vane on important business! Yes, I perceive you know my affairs
                  thoroughly!"</p>
               <p>And Mr. St. John concluded with a burst of laughter which caused Jack Hamilton to
                  look rather sheepish.</p>
               <p>"I've plainly got the better of you, my dear fellow," said St. John, "and now I
                  shall leave you to continue my ride. I want exercise—come, go with me."</p>
               <p>"Willingly; I have a little message for the squire at the Hall yonder—let us go
                  there."</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John assented, and very soon the two friends were in the saddle and on
                  their way to Effingham Hall. The old mansion ere long rose before them, and they
                  passed beneath the great trees, and stopped at the door.</p>
               <p>On the portico, the old squire, now grown gray, but lusty and determined as
                  before, was arguing vigorously with his<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6146-00000152"/>
                  old neighbor, Mr. Lee, on whose head had also descended the snows of those ten
                  additional winters. As in long past days, the squire indignantly denied the
                  propositions of his friend before they were enunciated, and, in contrast to all
                  this violent discussion of the gray heads, at their feet a child was busily
                  weaving larkspurs—those little flowers resembling goblin hoods—into a wreath,
                  intent upon her toil and wholly indifferent to the progress of the argument.</p>
               <p>Mr. Champ Effingham and Madam Clare came forth to welcome their friends—the one
                  calm and serene, the other smiling and bright—and behind these, Mr. William
                  Effingham, raised his intelligent head, and shot a stately smile; one hand
                  extended courteously, the other supporting a form leaning on his arm.</p>
               <p>Before this latter, says our worthy author, with her joy and beauty, and perennial
                  loveliness and goodness; before Kate Effingham, now as in old days, the queen of
                  purity and meekness, the present chronicler bends to the very ground, and takes
                  his hat off and does homage, as in presence of an empress. Not in vain has his
                  pen, gliding through the hours, and taking him from present scenes to older days
                  and figures; not in vain has his pen labored, as the painter's brush does, to
                  delineate the lovely visions of the past, when this fair form remains to speak of
                  him. Among those faces and characters which he tried to draw, and which he is fain
                  to hope, the readers of the present chronicle will have also looked on—among all
                  the figures of his former history, not one contents him but this maiden.
                  Everywhere something is to add to make the drawing worthier, something to take
                  away, an outline to round, a trait to expand; but here he can add nothing. Not
                  from his idle imagination could this picture have proceeded—this vision of purity
                  and joy. A portrait painter simply, he can claim no laurels such as are justly due
                  to the great artist originating from an inner impulse something new and beautiful.
                  Old letters, yellow and faded, and crumbling into dust, told of that fairest
                  maiden; and her portrait yonder, laughing on my wall, spoke audibly the words I
                  read, with pensive smiles, from the old sheet her snowy fingers rested on. I read
                  those dear old letters often—letters commencing, "Dearest Bonnybel," and ending,
                  "Your own Kate"—and thus, with these memorials, I knew what loveliness and
                  goodness the original of the portrait was endowed with. Then with this image of
                  the maiden of the last century, blended the fair figure of a child of the present
                  age—a child of such rare and touching purity and truth, that thinking of her now,
                  I grow young again almost, and live in the scenes of other years—bright years
                  which have flown, but left behind the aroma of their joy and tenderness, and
                  sunshine. Thus I am satisfied, as far as that is possible in any instance, with
                  the picture of this maiden—I have nothing to add, no trait to change. I shall
                  never do the like again, and I dare not introduce her into the present history, or
                  even so much as repeat her letters. As she passes before me smiling and beautiful,
                  with the light on her hair and in her tender eyes; as she glides on thus like a
                  vision or a dream; I stand aside as she moves, and only smile as I look, and
                  return to that life which is poor and cold without her, for it holds no figure
                  adequate to represent her beauty!</p>
               <p>After this fashion does our worthy old chronicler discourse upon the subject of
                  Mrs. William Effingham, which lady seems to have been an extreme favorite with
                  him. In the former portion of this MSS. this feeling of complaisant satisfaction
                  with his work more than once appears, and as, doubtless, the character of Miss
                  Kate Effingham shone fairer for him than it can for the reader, we may pardon his
                  rhapsody, as the harmless exhibition of that fondness for youthful recollections,
                  which frequently characterizes elderly gentlemen.</p>
               <p>We should extract the author's account of Mr. St. John's visit to Effingham Hall,
                  which he describes at length, repeating all the conversation of the personages,
                  but unfortunately our narrative leads us to more important scenes.</p>
               <p>The friends remained to dinner, which was served at an<pb n="304-305"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000153"/> early hour, and then departing, the two gentlemen
                  returned homeward—Mr. Hamilton to the "Trap," and Mr. St. John toward
                  Williamsburg.</p>
               <p>His route lay in the direction of the old field school, and just as he came
                  opposite that sylvan academe, Uncle Jimmy Doubleday terminated the toil of the
                  day, and gave the summons of dismissal to his flock of chirping youngsters, male
                  and female.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER LVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE SECOND WARNING.</head>
               <p>THE young man was in an idle mood, and attracted by the fresh faces of the
                  children, always favorites with him, halted, and turning in his saddle, followed
                  their gay gambols with a pleased smile.</p>
               <p>It was not long before a figure detached itself from the merry flock of boys and
                  girls, and this little figure approached the fence, and made Mr. St. John a
                  smiling curtesey.</p>
               <p>It was Blossom, and the young lady seemed to experience much pleasure in again
                  meeting with her friend.</p>
               <p>The man and the child had scarcely exchanged greetings when Uncle Jimmy Doubleday
                  himself made his appearance, framed, like a gigantic pedagogue, in the doorway of
                  the old field school. Seeing Mr. St. John, Uncle Jimmy came toward that gentleman,
                  walking, with the dignity of a patriarch, in the midst of his family and
                  tribe.</p>
               <p>"You behold a pleasing sight, my dear Mr. St. John," said Uncle Jimmy, taking off
                  his great goggles, and extending the hand holding them toward the flocks of
                  children. "I hold not with the heathen philosophers that children are as ciphers
                  in the state; to my mind, they are meadow flowers which gladden the hearts of
                  those who look upon them, and in all the various relations of our life, wield
                  mighty influences."</p>
               <p>Uncle Jimmy stooped, in a dignified way, to button a negligent "point" of his
                  splatterdashes as he spoke, and then pulled his long waistcoat again carefully to
                  his knees.</p>
               <p>"I think with you, Mr. Doubleday," replied the young man smiling, "that they are
                  great blessings; their affection often outweighs that of older persons."</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is true," said Uncle Jimmy, placing a fatherly hand on the sunny curls
                  of little Blossom, who stood demurely by him, one foot based firmly on the ground,
                  the other poised upon the toe of her slipper—the neat stockings, without crease or
                  fold, beneath the short skirt; "that is true, Mr. St. John, and in my little
                  friend, Blossom, here, who seems to know you, I recognize a treasure of goodness
                  and affection. Nay, do n't blush, my child; I like to praise you for your dutiful
                  and obedient conduct. I only wish you would give a little of your character to
                  that young scamp, Paul, who narrowly escaped the birch this morning."</p>
               <p>And Uncle Jimmy smiled.</p>
               <p>Before Blossom could defend her sweetheart, Uncle Jimmy felt a hand on the skirt
                  of his long coat, and turning round, beheld the smiling physiognomy of Master
                  Paul.</p>
               <p>"I say, Uncle Jimmy," said that young man, "I did n't mean to hit you on the nose,
                  shooting that pea. I was only trying Bob Dandridge's popgun, and I did n't mean
                  for it to go off."</p>
               <p>"Behold, Mr. St. John, the depravity of the character of children," said Uncle
                  Jimmy, with philosophic severity; "this youth is really incorrigible; reproving
                  does not affect him in the least; he always begs off in a way which indicates a
                  natural genius for the forum."</p>
               <p>And Uncle Jimmy frowned at Paul, after which he turned away his head to smile.</p>
               <p>Whether Master Paul saw the smile or not, we can not say, but he uttered the
                  observation, "Uncle Jimmy, me and Blossom like you very much," after which the
                     youngster<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6146-00000154"/> ran to his pony, and
                  putting Blossom up behind him, galloped off toward "Roseland," her father's
                  cottage.</p>
               <p>"Such is the nature of children," said Uncle Jimmy, smiling and taking a pinch of
                  rapparee, which he offered to his friend, "they laugh at every thing."</p>
               <p>"I think 't is a better philosophy than groaning," said St. John.</p>
               <p>"Doubtless, but many disappointments await them; life is a hard enemy. A decade
                  from this moment and they will change their merriment to sorrow, their smiles to
                  sighing."</p>
               <p>St. John smiled.</p>
               <p>"Then your theory questions the possibility of perfect happiness to adults," he
                  said.</p>
               <p>"Almost," replied Uncle Jimmy.</p>
               <p>"Suppose a grown man, as this child will be in the decade you speak of; suppose
                  such a man is loved devotedly by a woman, all purity and truth," said the young
                  man, smiling with his happy secret; "suppose the whole treasure of a beautiful and
                  noble nature is his own; is not that something like the happiness you deny
                  men?"</p>
               <p>Uncle Jimmy shook his head.</p>
               <p>"Time is uncertain," he said; "woman more uncertain than time."</p>
               <p>"Some are," said St. John, laughing at his companion's ignorance; "others are the
                  pole stars of the earth."</p>
               <p>Uncle Jimmy shook his head again.</p>
               <p>"It is well to look keenly to see whether the star we have taken for the polar
                  light, is not in the constellation of the Serpent—<hi rend="i"/>Scorpio, my
                  friend. Truly hath it been said by Horatius, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"'——uxorem cum dote fidemque et amicos</l>

                     </lg>
                  </q> meaning, as you doubtless comprehend, that women are oft swayed by worldly
                  considerations. But let me not seem uncharitable. Perhaps grief has soured me and
                  clouded my eyes. It is the old who chant the<q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"'Præcipe lugubres</l>

                     </lg>
                  </q> and beating their breasts cry, 'Oh, Postumus! Postumus! how the flying years

                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"'Eheu fugaces, Postume, Postume!</l>

                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And Uncle Jimmy sighed and was silent, betaking himself, for consolation, to his
                  snuff again.</p>
               <p>In taking the box from his pocket, he dropped a letter, which came out with it,
                  and as this circumstance did not attract his attention, St. John pointed to
                  it.</p>
               <p>Uncle Jimmy stooped to pick it up rather hastily, and the young man's eye chanced
                  to fall upon the direction. He smiled, for it was in a lady's handwriting.</p>
               <p>"That seems to be from a fair friend—is it not?" he said, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Y—es," observed Uncle Jimmy, rather shyly, "it <emph>is</emph> from a friend of
                  mine."</p>
               <p>"A lady?"</p>
               <p>"Well, yes, my dear Mr. St. John, but the affair is simply—Platonic—simply that,
                  upon my word, sir."</p>
               <p>And Uncle Jimmy put the letter in his pocket. St. John did not say that the
                  preaching and practicing of the philosopher badly agreed, but he thought so, and
                  thus triumphed.</p>
               <p>After a little more friendly conversation, they parted, and Uncle Jimmy returned
                  toward the old field school house, now deserted. Mr. St. John continued his way
                  back to Williamsburg, smiling.</p>
               <p>"What an amusing illustration of human philosophy that was!" he said, "but how
                  strange that thus, for the second time in three or four days, I have listened to a
                  voice unconsciously bidding me distrust my happiness, and prepare for a change,
                  for misery. The other day it was, 'Heaven will not permit you to rust in the sloth
                  of happiness at such a crisis;' to-day it is, 'Woman are scorpions!' What sad<pb
                     n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6146-00000155"/> philosophy! Ah, they do not know that
                  the gift of this noble love comes straight from heaven, and will purify me; they
                  do not know that whatever other women may be, this one is nearly an angel in
                  faithfulness and truth. A change in her love! I should sooner look to see the star
                  of evening yonder dart from its orbit, and fade into nothing. How unhappy must
                  these poor hearts have been, to doubt the certainty of <emph>my</emph>
                  happiness!"</p>
               <p>And smiling tranquilly, the young man went upon his way.</p>

               <opener>
                  <dateline>"WILLIAMSBURG, Tuesday.</dateline>
                  <salute>"MY DEAR TOM,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>"I send you the contents of your memorandum, as far as I could procure the
                  articles, and am sorry to hear that you are indisposed. I trust 't is but
                  trifling. I might beg your pardon for detaining Dick, and for sending an inferior
                  quality of hair powder, but I have been too much troubled to have my right wits
                  about me.</p>
               <p>"Instead of trying to think of some news, which 't is certain this execrable place
                  do n't afford, I will proceed to tell you the origin of my trouble. I do n't know
                  if it 's a natural weakness, or springs from the depth of the feeling I
                  experience, but I think it will relieve me to unburden my trouble to a true friend
                  like yourself, and perhaps you will be able to give me some cheering view of the
                  affair.</p>
               <p>"I will announce the cause of my trouble at once. I have just returned from
                  Vanely, and the person that I love more than the whole world has received me
                  almost with coldness.</p>
               <p>"Can you imagine the possibility of that? Do n't you think I am out of my senses?
                  You know, as so true a friend deserved to know, the whole of my position there,
                  and every thing; and this knowledge will make you doubt my sanity. When you have
                  heard my narrative, however, which I write with a heavy heart, you will be forced
                  to believe me.</p>
               <p>"I had been here attending to my affairs for more than a sen'night, when one
                  morning, having dispatched my estimates—for the building up yonder, you
                  know—sooner than I expected, I felt an absolute thirst for <emph>her</emph>
                  society, and determined to gallop all the way to Vanely to have a little of it.
                  Out of her presence I only breathe, I think—I do not live, or enjoy existence. I
                  had felt indeed for these seven days during which I was absent, that the world
                  would be but a poor place for me without her; that I would not care to live; and
                  away from her now for even this small space, it seemed to me that the sun did not
                  shine as brightly, and that even the orioles which flew over the roof tops sang
                  almost harshly. I 'm not ashamed to say I love her with my whole heart and soul,
                  and I had to go and see her again!</p>
               <p>"Well, I went, and although she received me with happy smiles, I thought I
                  discerned some constraint, and even a certain coldness in her air. I make you my
                  father confessor for the nonce, and I pour my story into your friendly ear. It
                  troubles me, Tom, and I have to speak. I could not have imagined this thing—making
                  a buggaboo for my private annoyance—I discerned this coolness plainly, for the
                  eyes of a man who feels as I do toward <emph>her,</emph> grow supernaturally
                  penetrating, his ears nervously sensitive to the most delicate variations in the
                  tone of voice. It seems to me that since I have loved this beautiful girl, I have
                  received the faculty of plunging into her very soul, and often I have read her
                  very thoughts, and replied in such a way as to startle her. I can not explain this
                  thing, which I blunder out without expressing my meaning in the least; but I mean
                  that every shadow passing over the mirror of her mind seems to cloud my own; every
                  happy thought in her<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6146-00000156"/> bosom seems to be
                  transferred to my own heart. I share her disquiet, partake of her joy, and down to
                  the least sentiment, the most minute and varying emotion—what affects her affects
                  me, even before she has spoken—for I love her.</p>
               <p>"Whether you understand this rhapsodical passage or not, it contains none the less
                  the very simplest truth, and the sympathy thus existing between us made me at once
                  aware that in some way her feeling for me had been modified. The family did not
                  observe the least change; and the explanation of that fact was very simple. They
                  might have attributed a much greater constraint to mere bashfulness at her
                  position, always an embarrassing one, I am told, to young girls. Certain it is
                  they saw nothing.</p>
               <p>"As I have told you over and over—for my distress makes me garrulous and
                  disconnected—I saw it distinctly. The sailor sees and notes with attention and
                  anxiety the cloud no larger than the hand of a child on the far horizon of the
                  sea, while the landsman only looks up when the rain begins to fall, or the thunder
                  mutters and the lightnings flash! The reason is, that, to the latter, it is but a
                  question of rain which he may avoid by entering his house, while the remote speck
                  for the sailor contains storm and tempest which may plunge his craft beneath the
                  hungry waves, and himself with it.</p>
               <p>"I weary you, Tom, with my poor wandering words, but I repeat that this troubles
                  me. I saw in <emph>her</emph> eyes that indefinable shadow which indicates a
                  change; there was no longer the same sunny frankness, the same joy and
                  abandonment, if I may use the word. With a smile, assumed to hide my disquiet, I
                  asked her if my absence had tried her affection—my 'lengthy sojourn in foreign
                  lands,' I said, making a jest, you see, or attempting to—and she, with a smile
                  which I thought as forced as my own, said, 'Oh no, how could I say such a thing?'
                  But the constraint remained, and after a hundred attempts to fathom the mystery, I
                  gave up in despair.</p>
               <p>"I remained from the evening of one day to the morning of the third day. I think
                  the constraint grew almost to coldness before I departed, and, as I write, I am
                  greatly distressed. You see, Tom, this is no trival affair with me. I have built
                  all my future on the broad foundation of this woman's love, and I can not love
                  lightly. Where the heart's given with me, it 's given for ever, and this troubles
                  me. Formerly nothing troubled me; but I am changed now. I no longer look upon life
                  with that careless and almost disdainful indifference with which I once regarded
                  it. You may have heard me say a thousand times that nothing could annoy me long or
                  deeply, that I was 'sufficient for myself,' that the world and its inhabitants
                  might go their way and I would go mine, unmoved by their opinion good or bad,
                  unaffected either by their love or their hatred—at least, greatly. Well, now, I
                  say that no longer. I wish everybody's good opinion; for the expression of this
                  good opinion doubtless gives <emph>her</emph> pleasure. Can't you understand my
                  meaning? Can't you see how a man who formerly laughed at the idea of being moved
                  in the least by a world of women, now fixes his eyes upon a single one's face, and
                  lives only when he thinks of her or 's with her? I am even proud of my bondage,
                  for I know that the chain binding me binds her, that <emph>my</emph> love is as
                  much to her as her own is to me—atleast it was the other week.</p>
               <p>"I write the words with a heavy heart. I tell you, Tom, there 's no doubt about
                  the coldness. The absence of her former frankness and joy was, and is, proof
                  strong as holy writ. Something has come between us, I know not what. Write what
                  you think of it; I am blind, I confess it. Like that seer of the middle age, who
                  bartered all his lore for love, and gave up willingly his power over the invisible
                  denizens of earth and air, to be a simple mortal, and lean on a woman's bosom, as
                  her equal and love; like him, I have lost, perhaps, my penetration; I am troubled,
                  it may even be, by a chimera, for I confess I begin to distrust myself. If she is
                  untrue, then all things are false, and, with the rest,<pb n="312-313"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000157"/> my intellect. Friend, help me to extricate myself
                  from this web, which seems to be even now closing round me, wrapping me closer and
                  closer in its mysterious folds. I scarcely know what I write, and I doubt if it is
                  sense; but there is something, I know not what—I feel it! I breathe it! There is
                  some evil at work upon my life! I am not superstitious, but it seems to me that a
                  cloud is rising somewhere, with which I am to struggle, though I can not grasp it.
                  Have you never felt this irrational foreboding? If you have not, you will laugh at
                  me, but your laugh will not affect me. You must first tell me why here, in the
                  morning, with the sunlight around me, with my nerves perfectly healthful, my pulse
                  beating with its wonted regularity; why thus, in perfect health of mind and body,
                  I feel as if a dark fate were at work upon my life, travailing to bring forth my
                  misery!</p>
               <p>"That you will think me insane after this full and unreserved expression of what I
                  meant to conceal, even from you, friend, I fully expect. Whatever you think, I can
                  not complain. I frankly confess that I have given you but sorry and foolish
                  grounds for my disquiet.</p>
               <p>"What! I hear you say, St. John become superstitious, trembling at such bugbears
                  of the fancy as are only fit to frighten nervous women! St. John, the careless
                  fellow with the stalwart shoulders, the iron nerves, the smiling lips; who touched
                  his sword hilt, and boasted that he was ready to meet any foe, and would have
                  laughed in derision at the very intimation of imaginary disquietude! St. John, now
                  crouching and shrinking under an invisible lash, wielded by airy hands! St. John
                  a-trembling, like a baby, at the sight of a buggaboo, and whining out
                     <emph>mysterious influences!—secret warnings!</emph> I hear you say that, and I
                  fancy you shaking your head, and thinking that from this time forth, you can never
                  trust in human boastings, or, any man, however healthy's nerves. Well, friend, be
                  it as you will; I do not try to convince you—I yield. Say, if you choose, that I
                  am mastered by a dream, a vision of the night, a very shadow and chimera. But I am
                  none the more convinced, none the less mastered by my insanity, if you like the
                  word. I tell you, friend, earnestly, strongly! with my whole force! that, even as
                  I write, this influence is growing, increasing, darkening terribly! More than
                  ever, there is in the full sunshine a sad splendor, gloomier than midnight! More
                  than ever, I thrill with a nameless dread! I seem to see descending on me a huge
                  ebon cloud! A thrill runs through my veins—my hair stands up! there are forms
                  around me; one, that of a woman with cold eyes, and a sneer which chills me!
                  There! before me as I write! Away!</p>

               <p>"Well—</p>
               <p>"I shall end this letter, my dear friend, with words less fanciful than those
                  above. Perhaps there <emph>is</emph> something wrong with my nerves; I am out of
                  health, it may be; I am sick. For, after writing those hurried words there, it
                  seemed to me that an enemy stood beside me, advanced toward me—a something, I know
                  not what, which matched itself against me! 'T is gone now, but to prove to you how
                  profoundly I was moved, look at that blot upon the paper. It was caused by my pen
                  falling from my trembling fingers, as I rose to my feet, drawing my sword
                  completely from the scabbard, and striking madly at the air. Doubtless I am sick,
                  for even now my breast seems contracting, and I breathe heavily. There, 't is
                  doubtless the old story of Marius cutting at his visions when he was dying—the
                  fever moving him.</p>
               <p>"Yet my pulse beats regularly again; I see myself in the mirror yonder, and my
                  complexion is healthful; I do not seem sick. I must be, however, for no traces of
                  my delirium remain—I write calmly. Keep my letter as a striking exhibition of the
                  power of the imagination.</p>
               <p>"I will end with a few words of news. His Excellency is said to regard the
                  convention of the delegates with side looks and suspicion, and to threaten. But he
                  will do nothing. All your friends are well. At Vanely, every one is well, I think,

                  know not why, I have taken up a prejudice against her. Another of my irrational
                  whims, you will say—well, but she none the more pleases me with her dark,
                  wary-looking eyes.</p>

                     perused thy letter with abundant laughter, and return unto thee my most
                     grateful thanks for dissipating a catarrh which has troubled me this
                     fortnight!</p>
                  <p>"In this mournful vale of tears, O Henricus! not every day do the immortals
                     vouchsafe to the inhabitants of earth the high prerogative and privilege of
                     inextinguishable laughter. This assurance will I write unto thee, O Henry! thy
                     prelection having rendered it incumbent. Even now a nasal cachinnation, or
                     inaudible expiration, vulgarly called <emph>snicker,</emph> doth bear witness

                  <p>"To be serious, and stop my jesting, my dear Harry, pray tell me what, in the
                     name of all the gods at once, has thrown you into this nervous state of mind?
                     Is it too much work, or the want of my cheerful society, or the sight of that
                     fine gentleman, his Depravity Lord Dunmore? I have never before known you to
                     give evidence of this strange susceptibility to superstitious impressions, and
                     though I make a jest of your letter, and certainly did laugh at first, it has
                     been productive, by this time, of far more disquiet to me.</p>
                  <p>"You rightly supposed that I would consider your fancies the product of
                     disordered nerves, and I here declare, once for all, that they seem to me the
                     very climax of irrationality, from first to last. What! you can not permit a
                     young girl of the most timid and shrinking disposition to exhibit a little
                     embarrassment at your arrival—you, her accepted lover, and I wish you joy of
                     it! You can't let her blush a little, and leave the burden of the conversation
                     to the rest, and retire when she feels sick, or looks badly, and fears you will
                     not admire her in that plight, and therefore hides herself; you can't permit
                     those most natural and obvious every-day, humdrum occurrences to take place,
                     without imagining a change in her feelings, a diminution of her love, an
                     interruption of her affection? Fie, Harry! 't is but a poor lover that you
                     make, and I predict that if you go on with your fancies, 't will end in
                     frightening her, and causing the very thing which you dread. It is my
                     intention, throughout the two following pages, to dwell upon this subject of
                     the young lady's constraint, which you, yourself, acknowledge no one observed
                     but a certain Mr. St. John, gifted, for<pb n="316-317"
                        xml:id="VAC6146-00000159"/> the nonce, with nautical penetration to discern
                     distant clouds, and atmospheric phenomena, invisible to landsmen; it is my
                     intention to proceed at length to the refutation of your fancies on this point,
                     and then I shall handle more briefly the phantom appearances.</p>

                  <p>"Having thus completely demolished your first point, absolutely leveled it with
                     the ground, plowed up the foundations, and sowed salt in the furrows, I proceed
                     briefly, as my paper decreases, to speak of your phantoms. My dear Harry, can
                     you seriously believe in those idle stories?</p>
                  <p>"There was a time, certainly, when the best minds, ignorant and surrounded by
                     common things which they could not understand, took refuge, from their blank
                     thoughts, in an irrational superstition. Socrates, it is said, believed in a
                     familiar spirit, Friar Bacon also, and even that strong-minded old fellow,
                     Doctor Johnson, to come nearer, gives credit to the story of the Cock Lane
                     Ghost. The others had strong intellects, but they lived in an age of scientific
                     darkness, and we may pardon, while we deplore, the vagaries of their
                     imaginations. But that an educated gentleman of 1774, should seriously give
                     credence to the airy whisperings of such a philosophy as you do! that you, a
                     strong, healthy, hearty, educated individual should believe in secret warnings,
                     and mysterious presentiments! really the thing grieves me too much to permit
                     any more laughter.</p>
                  <p>"I pray you to banish these fancies, which are simply the result of disordered
                     blood, of a nervous attack, of loss of rest, probably, or excess in the use of
                     tobacco, the supply of which, being last year's crop, is, I think, particularly
                     rank and violent in its effect upon the nerves. Physical causes very frequently
                     produce mental effects, and if you see the devil enter, with horns and tail,
                     you have but to go to the next physician's library to read an account of the
                     same phenomenon witnessed a century ago by another sick as you are.</p>

                     censorious individuals are pleased to consider my carriage of person the proof
                     of a shallow nature, still I persist in declaring that I love my friends as
                     well and heartily as the best of them, and among these friends none takes a
                     place before yourself. I pray you throw aside these imaginary troubles, and do
                     not doubt that you have the entire affection of that beautiful nature, than
                     whom I know none purer or more faithful.</p>
                  <p>"I am still languid from my attack, or I would come to see you. Why should you
                     not make a visit here? Leave your plans for 'Flower of Hundreds,' and come, for
                     a day at least, and recover your spirits. You'll work all the better
                     afterwards. I shall assuredly expect your answer to this in person, and by word
                     of mouth.</p>
                  <p>"I thank you for the things. They are all excellent, except the hair powder,
                     which that abandoned profligate, Lafonge, has prepared with musk. My opinion of
                     that fellow is, that he is a wretch, and that the chief end and aim of his
                     whole existence is to disappoint, wound, and humiliate me. A hundred times I
                     have remonstrated with him, almost to tears, on his conduct. I have dedicated
                     whole mornings to the most pathetic representations, which he has listened to
                     with sobs, standing behind his counter, and wringing his hands, and promising,
                     between his sniffs of contrition, that in future he will be perfect. It is all
                     in vain; his insidious design is to mortify and humiliate me; he thinks even to
                     shorten my days by his unmanly persecutions. He is mistaken, however. This puts
                     the finish to our dealings. I distinctly ordered this hair powder to be
                     prepared in an apartment which a suspicion even of musk had never entered, and
                     here I and my household, the very dogs and cats, are turned into moschine
                     denizens of Thibet, causing me to blow my nose and groan every five minutes
                     while I write. Well, I have one recourse—Lafonge and myself<pb n="318-319"

                     were put to.</p>
                  <p>"I 've got to the end of my paper. Do not write, but come here and breathe a
                     purer atmosphere.</p>
                  <p>"For Heaven's sake do n't yield again to your fancies, which wound and distress

               </opener>
               <p>"YOUR letter, my dear friend, was scarcely different from what I expected. I was
                  perfectly well aware of the fact that my account of the singular influence I
                  experienced would excite rather laughter than sympathy, and I even add that your
                  reply contained less of banter than I expected.</p>
               <p>"It is unnecessary for me to say that your laughter did not annoy me at all. I
                  recognize your right to scold me as vigorously as you choose, for, as you say, we
                  are too close friends to stand upon the least ceremony. I thank you indeed for
                  your letter, filled as it was, the greater part of it, with the most friendly
                  assurances of regard, and the most labored attempts to raise my drooping spirits,
                  and cheer me after my afflicting adventure. After reading the sheets carefully I
                  laid them down, thinking your views admirably just. I said to myself that I would
                  not further continue the discussion, but leave to after events the determination
                  of the matter. I would willingly believe, if <emph>she</emph> met me as of old,
                  and if the presentiments did not return, that I was merely carried away by fancy,
                  and there would be the end of the argument, and your triumph. If, on the contrary,
                  this change became more marked in <emph>her</emph>—if these influences attacked me
                  more unmistakably—then, too, there would be an end of the discussion, and I should
                  have wofully triumphed.</p>
               <p>"I announce to you, with a groan as I write, that the last is the fact. I can not
                  come to Moorefield—I can not move now. I do what I can—I write.</p>
               <p>"In order to understand what has taken place since the arrival of your letter, and
                  to make myself better understood in the further account of what has befallen me, I
                  shall begin at the beginning, and trace the matter through all its steps; briefly,
                  however, for I am weak and faint.</p>
               <p>"To go back, then.</p>
               <p>"I left Vanely a fortnight or more ago, and came hither to see to a number of
                  arrangements connected with Flower of Hundreds, which is sadly in want of repairs,
                  owing, I suppose, to my long absence. As you may imagine, I carried away from
                  Vanely, in the looks and tones of <emph>somebody,</emph> what made these toils a
                  happiness, for <emph>she</emph> was to share the home I was bent on beautifying
                  for her reception.</p>
               <p>"I came hither, therefore, with a light heart, and proceeded to work. But the
                  strangest thing happened to me—so strange in connection with what has taken place
                  since that—but I will narrate.</p>
               <p>"On the very day of my arrival I encountered at the Raleigh tavern that strange
                  man of whom I have spoken to you more than once—the stranger of the old church of
                  St. John, at Richmond town. We talked of political matters, and when he came to
                  allude to the assistance the province<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6146-00000161"/>
                  demanded from all her patriotic inhabitants, I returned his strange confidence up
                  yonder, by speaking of myself, and saying that I would be able to do little, since
                  I had received from a woman an avowal of her affection, and was happy and content,
                  and disposed to think all things in the world just as they should be. He replied,
                  with a strange look, 'Do not think that Heaven will permit you to withdraw
                  yourself from the contest.' Those were his very words, and though I listened to
                  them then with careless inattention, I now remember them, and find them echoing,
                  like his deep voice, in my mind and my heart.</p>
               <p>"Some days after the interview with the stranger, I rode out, went to Jack
                  Hamilton's, and, with him, visited Effingham Hall, where I had a long and very
                  pleasant conversation with Mrs. Kate Effingham, <emph>her</emph> friend, you know.
                  Sure a woman never tires of dwelling on the merits of her friend, and my cheek
                  glowed, I think, as I listened to <emph>her</emph> praises. I came away with those
                  gracious words of love and praise resounding in my heart, and having left Hamilton
                  at the 'Trap,' proceeded toward Williamsburg. I stopped, however, to exchange a
                  few words with old Mr. Doubleday at the school house, and in some way, here too
                  the conversation turned upon human happiness and the female character. As the
                  stranger had intimated that Heaven would not permit me to enjoy tranquil happiness
                  in wedded life at such a juncture as the present, so now the old philosopher of
                  the school house croaked, 'Time is uncertain, woman more uncertain than time.' He
                  presented an admirable commentary on his sermon by dropping, accidentally, a
                  letter from a fair friend with whom he had an affair, 'simply Platonic,' he said,
                  and I came away laughing. But still these coincidences trouble me.</p>
               <p>"You see when a man has staked his whole earthly happiness upon the faith of a
                  single heart, he is no longer free, he no longer laughs with careless indifference
                  at theories affecting him; he is bound with a chain of gold, and at a certain spot
                  he is forced to pause and reflect. Happiness is more than life to the heart, at
                  least, happiness such as I play for, and I could not resist a sentiment of
                  disquiet in spite of my laughter and incredulity. I had built all my hopes on a
                  woman's faith; I had played my own happiness against that stake, and I could not
                  bear in my mind even a suspicion of the genuine nature of the coin. See my
                  miserable player illustrations—my figures, borrowed from the gaming table! I
                  attempt thus to divert my mind from what follows.</p>
               <p>"Let me say at once that I determined to go back, were it even for an hour, to
                  Vanely. I determined to escape thus from my foolish fancies; the very sight of her
                  tender and confiding countenance would dissipate my uneasiness and gloom.</p>
               <p>"You know the result of that visit, for I wrote you a lengthy account of it,
                  laboring, unsuccessfully it seems, to impress upon you the singular change which
                  proved the rationality of my fears, first suggested by the words of the stranger
                  and the old schoolmaster. It was in writing that letter, as you remember, that a
                  strange and mysterious presentiment attacked me—a presentiment which you laughed
                  at when you read my letter, and argued against in your reply, as a mere
                  hallucination, springing from nervousness, or illness. You shall judge whether I
                  was not sane and well—what follows will cut the knot.</p>
               <p>"Your letter, as I have said, communicated to my mind great cheerfulness. I read,
                  and reread it, and dwelt upon your views connected with the physical and mental
                  organization attentively and carefully. They seemed to me of excellent soundness,
                  and positively irrefutable. Not only your argument, but your laughter, had a
                  strong effect upon me. I imaged you remonstrating with Lafonge—I saw his
                  gestures—the horror you experienced at the discovery of the musk; and Milo's look
                  of reproach as you declared. Your laughter dispelled my gloom; your gayety brought
                  back the sunshine. From clouds I came forth into the sunny air; my surrounding of
                  presentiment was dispelled by<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6146-00000162"/> your
                  surrounding of merriment. Thus, your arguments and your smiles together made me
                  think that I had indeed yielded to an unhealthy melancholy; that my nerves had
                  disordered my mind, and that the distressing change in <emph>her</emph> demeanor
                  existed only in my fancy.</p>
               <p>"I therefore determined to go again to Vanely, and to enter the hospitable doors
                  unaccompanied by the least suspicion. All that should be left behind in this
                  detestable place, which I wonder now that I ever could have dwelt in. I would go
                  to Vanely with the smiling face of the past—with my arms stretched out to press
                  welcoming hands, as in old days. I would say to <emph>her,</emph> frankly, that I
                  had foolishly thought her feelings changed toward me, and would have a hearty
                  laugh at my imaginary disquiet. Sitting down, with a smile, I leaned my head upon
                  my hand, and imagined her replying, with a look of reproach, that I must have
                  indeed been very ill to think that <emph>she</emph> could ever change; and as I
                  fancied her smiling and tender countenance, my fears were all dissipated, and I
                  rose up joyfully and mounted my horse.</p>
               <p>"Never had I seen a morning so bright, I thought. Williamsburg no longer frowned,
                  the white houses smiled and saluted me, as on one happy morning when I cantered
                  by, from Richmond town, thinking of her and laughing. 'Tallyho' bore me into the
                  open country, to the ferry, across the bright waters, and into the smiling fields
                  of Vanely, far away from turmoil and confusion. As I entered that long-loved
                  land—as I breathed the fresh and balmy air, which, sure, is nowhere so inspiriting
                  as in our good Old Dominion—as I went along thus rapidly through forests, and
                  across blooming meadows, where the lark sang, and the wheat waved in luxuriant
                  gold, my last anxiety was dissipated, and I felt that I had not only been
                  irrational and ridiculous in my fancies; I had been unjust to one of the purest
                  and loveliest natures ever sent into the world.</p>
               <p>"I linger upon these emotions of freshness and joy, and pass to what followed with
                  reluctance and a sort of dread. I pause under the blue skies, without a cloud, and
                  turn away from the storm.</p>
               <p>"Well, I came thus to Vanely.</p>
               <p>"What I write now, friend, is between my lips and your ear, as though we sat alone
                  beneath a tree, in the middle of a field, you know, with no foliage to conceal a
                  listener—for you, and you only. Not only would it compromise a young lady, if
                  known, by speaking of her former demeanor to one who is not the same to her, but
                  it would, perhaps, procure me the reputation of a madman, and make me the subject
                  of a writ <foreign xml:lang="LAT">de lunatico inquirendo.</foreign> But I have set
                  out with the intention of telling you all, and I write nothing that I should not
                  write.</p>
               <p>"Well, to proceed.</p>
               <p>"As I entered the grounds, I more than ever busied my imagination happily with the
                  reception which I was sure to receive. When formerly I had gone from Vanely to
                  'Flower of Hundreds,' or elsewhere, and returned in the evening, she had come
                  always to meet me, sometimes to the outer gate, in her little chip hat, with a
                  smile on her lips and a flower in her hand. On such occasions I had strained my
                  eyes, from the far distance, to discern her form, relieved clearly against the
                  emerald sward, and even 'Tallyho' had tossed his head when the fair figure
                  glimmered in the sunset, for he knew and shared the delight of his master. As I
                  drew nearer, the animal's speed would increase, he would almost fly; in a moment
                  he would bear me to her side, and leaping from the saddle, I would hold in mine a
                  hand throbbing, like my own, with happiness. We ascended the Vanely hill, I
                  leading 'Tallyho,' she leaning on my arm, and stopping at times to caress the neck
                  of the animal, because he was <emph>mine,</emph> she said. And then she would turn
                  again with sweeter smiles to me; I would cover her hand with kisses, and if my
                  lips touched the pure forehead, she did not shrink, but, looking into my eyes with
                  an expression of the tenderest affection, told me, thus, that her feeling for
                  myself was an echo of my own for her. As I write now, her eyes shine<pb
                     n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6146-00000163"/> on me; I see the light on her hair, the
                  flower in her hand; I hold that hand, and groan, and endeavor, in vain, to
                  forget!</p>
               <p>"Well, I won't groan so! I think the sound must have attracted the attention of my
                  servant! A man can't see all his hopes pass from him, though, and smile as they
                  depart. I will stop my recollections, and proceed with the relation. It was in the
                  manner which I have described that I now expected to be met, and, sure, I thought,
                  she would at least meet me thus, after an absence of what seemed a century to
                  myself. I hastened forward, with eager looks, I am sure, certain of meeting her
                  upon the portico, or in the hall, for 't is impossible for her not to have known
                  of my approach, as 'Tallyho' neighed at the foot of the hill, and I saw the faces
                  of the family looking from the window. You know the sonorous sound of the animal,
                  and it announced my coming from the commencement of the winding road, where the
                  great elm stands by the gate.</p>
               <p>"She was not on the portico, she was not in the hall. Instead of her figure, I saw
                  Helen's and uncle's advance to greet me with friendly smiles and open hands.</p>
               <p>"I entered the sitting-room. <emph>She</emph> was bending over an embroidery
                  screen, with cheeks as red as blood, and I saw her tremble. As Helen came in again
                  (uncle had remained without to give orders about my horse), she rose, and with a
                  sort of spasmodic gesture, held out her hand. I took it in silence; nor do I know
                  whether I looked pale or red. Helen gazed at her in silence, too, and for a moment
                     <emph>she</emph> stood thus, cold and pale now as a statue, and fixing upon me
                  eyes which burnt into my brain, so wild was their expression. She looked like a
                  stricken bird, and leaned upon the screen for support.</p>
               <p>"Helen asked her if she were unwell. With something like a gasp, she said, in a
                  faint voice, 'Yes,' and passing before me like a phantom, was gone. I heard her
                  ascend slowly the broad stair-case, and then, as her footsteps died away, I looked
                  toward Helen with an expression of incredulous despair, and terrible curiosity, at
                  least, if my face spoke my thoughts. Helen was as profoundly astonished and
                  shocked as myself, however, and could only say that she could not imagine
                     <emph>what made Bonnybel unwell.</emph> I saw from her eyes, as she spoke, that
                  she did not believe the change in the young girl's manner of receiving me
                  attributable to illness; but we had no further opportunity of talking upon the
                  subject, as my uncle came in after seeing 'Tallyho' taken, smiling, hearty, and
                  cordial as before.</p>
               <p>"The old gentleman was in excellent spirits, and asked me a thousand questions
                  about the doings in Williamsburg, the convention at the Raleigh tavern, the
                  Governor's view of it—every thing. I replied at random, and I suppose he thought
                  me utterly careless whether my answers pleased him or not. You see I was racked by
                  my feelings; my mind was filled with an absorbing thought; I scarcely knew where I
                  was. I gazed at him when he spoke with the air of a man who is waked suddenly from
                  sleep, and is not permitted time to collect his thoughts. You will not feel
                  astonishment at this; my only surprise is that I did not burst forth into the cry
                  of an idiot or a madman, and toss and rave.</p>
               <p>"I suppose my uncle thought the inattention due to fatigue, for he made me go and
                  drink some Canary with him, and then dinner was served. <emph>She</emph> did not
                  appear, but she did come down in the evening, and my heart bled to see how pale
                  and sad she looked. As she gazed at me I saw her eyes swim in tears, and then she
                  turned away. All I could extract from her was an assurance that she felt grieved
                  at her coldness in meeting me, that she was very unwell—had been suffering much,
                  and—I must pardon her. She felt weak now, and believed she would retire, but Helen
                  would talk with me; I must not think her wanting in—politeness—or—or—affection.
                  She uttered the word with a hesitation, a flush in her cheeks, and a swimming of
                  the eyes, which showed how profoundly she was moved. I think her eyes gushed with
                  tears as she left the room, for she raised<pb n="326-327"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000164"/> her handkerchief quickly as she disappeared, and I
                  thought I heard a sob. I strangle one in my own throat as I write, friend, but I
                  shall proceed.</p>
               <p>"The interview I have just described will serve for the two or three others which
                  I held with her during this and the next day. There was the same mixture of
                  coldness and pain in the eyes, which spoke with a more terrible eloquence than any
                  lips could. More than once she pressed my hand in the most convulsive way, and her
                  lips opened as though she were about to speak. Before she uttered a word,
                  however—when I was wholly silent, fearful lest I should interrupt her, did I
                  speak—before the dumb lips formed the least sound, an expression of constraint and
                  coldness, almost of fear, would diffuse itself over her countenance, and coloring
                  to the temples, she would turn away in silence.</p>
               <p>"This is an exact description of the interview which we held about twilight on the
                  day after my arrival. We were on the portico alone, and after refusing thus to
                  speak, she pleaded a headache and retired, going to her chamber with the faint
                  step of one who is indeed sick, as she evidently was, for her eyes were red, and
                  her face so pale that it made my heart bleed to look at her.</p>
               <p>"She left me thus and I sat down, and looked out upon the fields. The sun was
                  setting, and throwing long shadows along the meadows, over the golden grain, which
                  undulated in the evening breeze, and from the great oaks, red now in the flush of
                  sunset, a low dreamy sigh seemed to steal, and die away in the bloody sky. Never
                  had I seen a landscape fuller of the elements of beauty, but never did I think a
                  night so sad. That sorrowful splendor in the sunshine, which I spoke of before,
                  again attracted my attention, and an oriole, upon the summit of the great oak
                  before the door, seemed to sing a funeral dirge.</p>
               <p>"Prepare now to laugh, friend—collect your incredulous philosophy. I am about to
                  utter more of my stupidities—I am going to make you think me more than ever
                  superstitious. I care not, I will continue. As I sat thus upon the portico, and
                  saw the mournful beauty of the sunset die away across the lands, I felt again that
                  same presentiment of evil which I formerly described. It seemed to me that again I
                  was encircled by hidden foes, that the atmosphere grew dark as though from a great
                  midnight cloud, and though I struggled to resist the impression, my nerves again
                  began to tingle, my pulse to throb unaccountably, my hair moved upon my head, and
                  a shiver ran through my body. I seemed to feel rather than see the presence of
                  something hostile to me—something cunning, insidious and dangerous—something I
                  must struggle against or yield to. A nameless dread seized upon me, and all color
                  forsook my cheek—as before, I laid my hand convulsively upon my sword.</p>
               <p>"In a moment the feeling disappeared, and I looked around to see if any one had
                  observed my agitation. I saw no person, and rising, entered the house, feeling
                  completely wretched. You think this only another evidence of disordered nerves;
                  well, you will soon see that I was ere long the victim of another hallucination,
                  if you choose, more strange and terrifying than this even.</p>
               <p>"I shall trace the remaining incidents in regular order. That evening
                     <emph>she</emph> came down, looking, as usual, pale, very pale, and so sad that
                  my heart sank as I gazed at her. I announced my intention of returning to
                  Williamsburg on the next morning, and as I did so I saw her turn her head hastily.
                  It was in the direction of myself, and for a moment our eyes met, and a long look
                  was exchanged. I never saw any thing so sad as those eyes—even now they haunt me,
                  and make me groan as I write. I went to her side, carelessly, but with a throbbing
                  heart; and taking a volume from the table, played with it, and tried to smile,
                  saying, with a wretched affectation of mirth, that I was no longer my own master
                  now, and that the repairs at Flower of Hundreds must not be delayed, under the
                  circumstances. I am a bad actor; I <emph>assume</emph> badly, and I think that
                  human laugh never before rang out so harsh and false. My muscles refused to obey
                  me—they rebelled—and the sound that<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC6146-00000165"/>
                  should have been mirthful must have almost been tragical and sinister.</p>
               <p>"She did not reply with a word; I waited in vain for her to speak, and after an
                  hour, during which she took part in the conversation only fitfully, and at
                  intervals, in the same forced way, she glided out of the apartment, and did not
                  return. My heart grew cold as she disappeared, for I had determined to hold a
                  private interview with her that night, when the rest of the family had retired,
                  and entreat her to explain her demeanor toward me. I had planned all this, down to
                  the very words which I would utter, the arguments I would use, and I thought she
                  would be unable to resist. You have seen how she defeated this scheme by simply
                  retiring without a word.</p>
               <p>"Well, I curbed, by a violent effort, all exhibition of my disappointment and
                  distress, determining to have the interview on the next morning, in the library,
                  before my departure. I felt as if I must either have this explanation or go mad,
                  and the discovery of the grounds of this terrible change must come from her lips
                  alone. The rest of the family, with the exception of Helen, did not seem to
                  perceive any thing unusual. Busy about other things, they left us to ourselves,
                  and did not occupy themselves with the expression of her countenance. Certainly
                  they never dreamed of watching her face with that rabid anxiety which led me to
                  bestow the closest scrutiny upon its most minute details—upon the most flitting
                  lights and shadows.</p>
               <p>"They must certainly have observed her constraint in my society—that she was not,
                  wholly, the same. But this was doubtless attributed by them all, as you suggested,
                  to maidenly modesty and timidity at her novel position in relation to myself. I
                  saw that I should only be stared at by Aunt Mabel or Miss Seraphina if I declared
                  myself surprised by the young girl's manner. They would think me the most
                  irrational of men, even foolish, if I gave expression to my pain—insulting,
                  perhaps, if I spoke of feeling offended. That could not be thought of, and I
                  placed all my hopes upon the interview with herself on the next morning. I
                  therefore talked upon other subjects, and finally retired to my chamber.</p>
               <p>"Now comes the account of my final hallucination, if you like the word, friend. I
                  approach what will doubtless lead you to believe that I am really a lunatic.</p>
               <p>"I went to my chamber at the hour of ten about, for in the country they retire
                  early, and I remained for an hour, perhaps, sitting by the open window, from which
                  I looked out upon the moonlit fields, and pondered. All was hushed, and no sound
                  disturbed the silence but the low twitter of the swallows which have their nests
                  beneath the eaves, and were going to sleep. The fitful sighing of the ocean breeze
                  in the great moonlit oaks served as a sort of burden to my sad thoughts, and
                  silent thus by the open window I reflected long and painfully upon the woful
                  change which had taken place in the feelings of that one whom I loved more than my
                  life. I remember that at last my thoughts dwelt upon the singular warnings I had
                  received before I had the least reason to suspect this change, and a slight
                  feeling of superstitious fear may have agitated me. I think that no man is wholly
                  free from this influence, which is due either to the stories of those old negro
                  nurses who frighten children, and instill thus early the seeds of superstition, or
                  to the perusal of those authors who make use of hobgoblins to lend attraction to
                  narratives otherwise stupid. There was some excuse for this sentiment, too, in my
                  surroundings. The chamber which I occupied was the 'haunted chamber,' that
                  invariable adjunct of a Virginia country house. Here, it was said, Mrs. Vane, my
                  uncle's mother, had died in great pain, and here, said the servants, she often
                  'walked.'</p>
               <p>"I was not afraid of the old gentlewoman's spirit at all, however, and if I
                  thought of her at all it was with a smile at my childish disquiet and foolish
                  superstition. I threw off my clothes, tried to make my prayer as my dear mother
                  taught me at her knee, and then, somewhat quieted by this<pb n="330-331"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000166"/> appeal to a higher power, extinguished the light in
                  the tall candlestick, and was soon asleep.</p>
               <p>"I do not know how long I slept, but I suddenly awoke with the consciousness that
                  something or somebody was at the side of my bed. I distinctly heard a low and
                  suppressed breathing, and opening my eyes, I swear I saw a white figure within
                  three paces of me, crouching and looking toward me, where I lay! The moonlight
                  fell upon the figure, and I saw that it was only a long, white garment, not unlike
                  grave-clothes, and from beneath the folds of this garment two burning eyes were
                  fixed upon me.</p>
               <p>"For a moment I lay motionless, in that stupor which possesses the frame
                  immediately upon awaking, and I remember thinking how foolish I was to fancy
                  myself awake, and not what I was, asleep and dreaming. Then I rose suddenly in the
                  bed, as the mist was dispelled from my mind, and as I did so, the figure hastily
                  retreated.</p>
               <p>"With a single bound, I was out of the curtains, and clutched my sword. A glimmer,
                  a stealthy footfall, and the figure melted into the darkness and disappeared.</p>
               <p>"I went quickly to the door, which had been left open, as the weather was warm,
                  and found it just as I had left it, almost ajar. A human figure could scarcely
                  have passed through it. I opened it, and went out in the upper hall. Every thing
                  was silent. I stood there for a moment with my sword in my hand, trembling, I
                  think, with a vague fear—for you must confess the adventure was enough to affect
                  the nerves of the boldest—and then I reentered the room. Every thing was just as I
                  had left it upon the preceding night; nothing had been disturbed. I looked at my
                  timepiece; it was half past two o'clock, and the moon, by whose light I made the
                  examination, was just setting.</p>
               <p>"I replaced my sword upon the chair by my bed, and sitting upon the side of the
                  couch, reflected, as you may easily imagine, upon what had just occurred. Could I
                  have been dreaming? Certainly it seemed to me that I was wide awake, that I saw
                  the thing with my material eyes; <emph>its</emph> eyes still burned before me, and
                  I heard the stealthy footfall. But was not this all fancy? Could the appearance be
                  real? I dismissed at once, you see, the thought of a spirit, though I still felt a
                  superstitious dread, and my only question was the state I had been in—sleeping or
                  awake. If awake, then some person had entered my room stealthily, and retreated as
                  noiselessly. Who could it have been, and what possible object could have produced
                  this nocturnal walking? Decidedly, I thought, I dreamed the whole thing, and took
                  the result of my nervous imagination, aroused and stung by my meditations at the
                  window, for the veritable presence of an intruder.</p>
               <p>"I remained thus lost in thought for half an hour, I suppose, and then I went and
                  locked the door, and returning to bed, lay down. After a while my thoughts ran
                  into each other, I began to dream, and then fell sound asleep. I was waked by the
                  sun shining in my face, and rose and dressed. As I did so, I almost laughed at my
                  dream, for it doubtless was such, as I do not believe in spirits, however
                  superstitious I may seem to you. Yet was it not strange that I should thus have
                  sprung up, and caught my sword, and followed my airy visitant? Think what you
                  may—laugh at me if you choose, but it seemed to me that those burning eyes were
                  like the eyes of the hostile figure in my first delirium, when I dropped the pen
                  upon the paper, writing to you, and rose clutching at my sword.</p>
               <p>"Well, let me finish my long, sad letter; I will proceed with the events of the
                  morning in turn. Finding that none of the family were yet stirring, I sat down at
                  the table, upon which were writing materials, and wrote you a note, asking you to
                  pay me a visit in Williamsburg—the note to await your appearance at Vanely. You
                  have doubtless received it, and pray come, my friend. Your presence will soothe
                  and cheer me. Do not measure my desire to see you by the brief nature of the note,
                  which was written, as you may imagine, under unfavorable circumstances. I must beg
                  you to pardon its style, and also the apparent discourtesy in not<pb n="332-333"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000167"/> sealing the wax with my signet. Upon looking on my
                  finger for it, I found it was gone, left, doubtless, on my table here when I went
                  to Vanely, though, strange to say, I have not found it, and even think that I
                  remember having it on when I went thither.</p>
               <p>"To end my letter with the events of the morning, however. As I informed you, I
                  had announced, on the previous evening, my intended departure, and every one had
                  given me commissions. I had letters to friends from my uncle, a memorandum from
                  Helen, and a package from Aunt Mabel for Mrs. Burwell, through a window of whose
                  dwelling, one night, not very long ago—but I am wandering, and, as it were, making
                  a sorrowful soliloquy. You see—to continue, calmly—I had, in every way, impressed
                  upon the family, including <emph>herself,</emph> the fact of my departure on that
                  morning early. I had, I said, pressing business; the architects, with their plans,
                  were waiting; beyond a peradventure I must certainly go—I could not remain. I
                  meant <emph>her</emph> to understand that I should not lengthen my visit, and that
                  an explanation must take place upon that morning, or I should continue miserable
                  away from her, not near her.</p>
               <p>"After finishing the note to you, therefore, I drew on my riding boots, with a
                  pair of large spurs, and leaving my chamber, descended the stair-case. I thought
                  the heavy sound of my footsteps, and the metallic ring of the spur chains, on the
                  oaken floor, would attract her attention, and bring her down to the library, which
                  I entered. Often when I was going over to 'Flower of Hundreds,' early in the
                  morning, this sound had drawn her from her chamber, fresh, rosy, and smiling with
                  happiness and beauty, like a flower of the morning—how I groan, friend as I write!
                  Well, well! I thought the desire of seeing me would again make her run to me, and
                  give me that innocent embrace which her pure heart accorded to me. Alas! she did
                  not come. I sat in the library, as yet untenanted, except by myself, and with the
                  'Gazette' open before me, made pretense to read, as the servant moved about; in
                  reality, I did not even see the letters—I was listening for her footsteps. If ever
                  you have thus sat, with a throbbing heart, and waited for a figure which did not
                  appear, you will know my breathless expectation, and my agony. My agony, for she
                  did not come.</p>
               <p>"The members of the family, one after another, entered; every one had a kind word,
                  a smile, and a regret at my departure, while <emph>she</emph>—she did not even
                  come to look coldly at me. I had not even the consolation of her frown. Well, I
                  did not ask why she delayed, I did not utter a word on the subject; somehow the
                  words stuck in my throat. I only conversed, with my eyes fixed upon the door; and
                  when Aunt Mabel thought I was listening, with the deepest attention, to her new
                  method of curing colds, I was trying to catch <emph>her</emph> approaching
                  footsteps.</p>
               <p>"Breakfast was announced, and every one sat down. Then Aunt Mabel asked the
                  question which I feared to propound, 'Where was Bonnybel?' She was unwell, Helen
                  said, and begged Cousin Harry to excuse her not coming down to bid him
                  good-bye.</p>
               <p>"As the words were uttered, I think I must have turned pale, and I sat down the
                  chocolate which I was raising to my lips. Aunt Mabel diverted attention from me,
                  however, by pausing, in her operations with the urn, to say, 'Unwell! why she was
                  well last night.' Helen replied that she did not think her sister had been well
                  for a week or two, and there the subject was dropped. Half an hour afterwards I
                  was in the saddle, on my way hither, without having seen her, and carrying away
                  with me no second message from her even.</p>
               <p>"And now, my friend, you have it all; you have, I think, the proof, full and
                  unanswerable, that I was not so irrational in my presentiments as you declared me.
                  I told you, in my former letter, that a cloud seemed descending on my life; I now
                  show you that cloud covering my whole existence. I said, in the commencement of
                  this letter, that I had determined, if <emph>she</emph> met me as of old, to
                  consider my foreboding only fancy, and thus <emph>you</emph> would triumph—the
                  woful triumph<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6146-00000168"/> umph, as you see, is my
                  own. Of these influences, I have no word more to say; they may return or
                  disappear, it is indifferent to me. It is nothing, either way, now when I am
                  perfectly wretched, when I am ruined, broken-hearted, overwhelmed by a fatality
                  which I can not oppose, and which crushes me in its inexorable grasp. I no longer
                  struggle, I no longer attempt to understand; silent, gloomy, and pale, I bend
                  under my fate, and only reply with hoarse groans.</p>
               <p>"I have written with forced calmness. Why I wrote at all I do not know, unless it
                  is from that mad despair which makes the dying soldier turn the weapon in his
                  breast.</p>
               <p>"I can write no more. I am faint, and seem to grow cold. Well, so it ends. I
                  thought—</p>
               <p>"I can write no more—not even tears will relieve me.</p>

               <head type="sub">HOW MR. ALSTON TRAVELED ALL NIGHT, AND WHAT FOLLOWED.</head>
               <p>THE letter which we have just laid before the reader reached Mr. Alston on the
                  afternoon of the day after it was written, and in fifteen minutes that gentleman,
                  looking very sad and gloomy, was on his way to Vanely.</p>
               <p>On the next morning, just as Mr. St. John had finished his toilet, he entered the
                  young man's chamber, having traveled all night.</p>
               <p>Up to the moment when his foot touched the threshold, Mr. Alston's face had worn
                  an expression of anxiety and care, very unusual with him, but no sooner had he
                  entered the presence of his friend, than this changed to an appearance of the most
                  careless humor.</p>
               <p>"Well, Harry, my boy," said Mr. Alston, "how is it this morning? how are the
                  nerves?"</p>
               <p>Instead of resenting this banter or expressing any surprise, Mr. St. John merely
                  held out his hand, rising for that purpose from the sofa upon which he lay, with
                  drooping head, and then having given this evidence of welcome, he sank back as
                  cold and silent as before.</p>
               <p>The reception did not seem to please Mr. Alston; he gazed for a moment with an
                  expression of great feeling at the pale, cold face, turned away from him; at the
                  drooping brows, the half-closed eyes, and the lips indicating hopeless
                  despair.</p>
               <p>"Come, Harry, my dear fellow," he said, rapidly changing his expression, and
                  speaking in a tone of careless good humor, "this is a poor greeting, and you have
                  not replied to my question."</p>
               <p>"Your question, Tom?" asked Mr. St. John, waking up, as it were, and looking
                  absently at his friend.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my question!"</p>
               <p>"What was it? You must pardon me, Tom, I 'm not very well this morning, or very
                  lively, as you may imagine."</p>
               <p>"Bah! all the imagination is on <emph>your</emph> side. My question was in the
                  words and figures following, to wit: 'how are your nerves?'"</p>
               <p>"Quite firm."</p>
               <p>"Has a mouse run across the floor?"</p>
               <p>His friend looked at him with an expression of inquiry.</p>
               <p>"I say, has a mouse squeaked this morning, and thrown you into agonies?"</p>
               <p>The look of inquiry changed to one of cold surprise, which it seemed Mr. Alston
                  comprehended.</p>
               <p>He burst out laughing.</p>
               <p>"I understand!" he said, "you are ready to cut my throat because I refer to your
                  nerves. Well, I believe I am competent to form an opinion, and empowered to
                  express the same, I only being responsible, under the circumstances, for the said
                  expression of the said opinion. The practical application which I make, on the
                  present occasion, of this little observation<pb n="336-337"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000169"/> servation, is simply as follows. The dreadful words
                  have been uttered now, and if my opinions upon the nervous system do not please
                  monsieur, I am entirely at his orders, my preference being for the short
                  sword!"</p>
               <p>St. John sat down and leaned his head upon his hand.</p>
               <p>"Pardon my coldness and irritation, Tom," he said, "I can't afford to lose any
                  friends now."</p>
               <p>"Ah! you come to reason, do you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I would keep the few hearts I retain. You see I 'm a poor miserable devil
                  that do n't dare to quarrel—I 'm too wretched for that."</p>
               <p>"Wretched folly it indeed is, Harry my boy, to say that you are wretched—or
                  rather, to proceed logically, to say that you have any reason to be wretched."</p>
               <p>"Have you received my last letter?" said St. John, suppressing a groan.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have."</p>
               <p>"And you laugh still?"</p>
               <p>"Most heartily."</p>
               <p>"It is at my distress, then."</p>
               <p>"No; at your philosophy."</p>
               <p>"Of what?"</p>
               <p>"Why, of spirits."</p>
               <p>St. John made a movement with his head, signifying plainly, "You are at liberty to
                  laugh."</p>
               <p>"I understand very well," said his friend; "you mean by that lordly nod to grant
                  me permission to think as I may. Well, my dear friend, I cheerfully avail myself
                  of your permission, and consider that you ought to have a nurse to put you in bed,
                  and to sleep in the same room with you."</p>
               <p>St. John was silent. What he had said in his letter was true. He no longer cared
                  to discuss the strange presentiments, and the dream, if it were a dream. In his
                  agony all other things were swallowed up, and after the momentary outbreak he felt
                  no anger even at the rough address of his friend.</p>
               <p>This, however, seemed to be just what Mr. Alston desired to excite—he wished to
                  arouse the young man. When his taunts were received with indifference he seemed
                  disappointed.</p>
               <p>"Come," he said, returning to the attack, "confess, my dear Harry, that you are a
                  baby."</p>
               <p>"If you choose, I will."</p>
               <p>"A child frightened by a buggaboo."</p>
               <p>"I have no objection."</p>
               <p>"Really," said Mr. Alston, with a compassionate air, "you do seem to me a mere
                  girl; put the cover over its head and stop whimpering, and go to sleep—mammy's
                  sitting by its bed!"</p>
               <p>St. John made no reply.</p>
               <p>"Would you have a little pap, mother's darling?" inquired Mr. Alston.</p>
               <p>"No, I thank you."</p>
               <p>"A sugar rag 's convenient."</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John nodded his head.</p>
               <p>"Mammy won't let bogy frighten mother's darling—ugly bogy, coming here to scare
                  his mother's own sweet ducky dear."</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John had even ceased to hear the voice of his friend; stretched upon a
                  lounge, he was thinking, with far away eyes set in a face as pale as death.</p>
               <p>"Harry St. John," said Mr. Alston, suddenly dropping his tone of banter, "do you
                  wish to hear my real opinion of you?"</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John turned toward his friend, looked at him for a moment, intently, and
                  said:</p>
               <p>"I will listen."</p>
               <p>"Well, sir," said Mr. Alston, austerely, "I consider you an idiot."</p>
               <p>And Mr. Alston raised his head with a haughty air, and placed his hand upon the
                  hilt of his sword.</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John only looked at him more attentively.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said Mr. Alston, coldly, "I understand your gaze very well; you think
                  to intimidate me. But you will<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC6146-00000170"/> not,
                  sir! no, sir! I am not to be bullied! I say again, sir, and I will repeat it a
                  third time, if necessary, that my real opinion of you is that you are an idiot—a
                  fool. There, sir! I am ready to take the responsibility of that declaration."</p>
               <p>St. John scarcely raised his head, and for a moment did not speak.</p>
               <p>"Miserable coward!" said Mr. Alston, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">sotto voce,</foreign>
                  and frowning.</p>
               <p>A long silence followed—it was broken by Mr. St. John. He rose wearily from the
                  sofa, passed his hand over his forehead and said,</p>
               <p>"You 're a good friend, Tom. I can not, however, say as much for your acting. You
                  are quite transparent. I see plainly what brings you, and I know very well what
                  you intend by your affected taunts and insults. You overdo it; but even were it
                  acted with a reality which persuaded me of the sincerity of your desire to offend
                  me, I doubt if I should resent your words. You wish to arouse me by your
                  stage-play, but I am too dreary and despairing. All 's over for me; I yield. I do
                  not even hear your insults distinctly, for my mind is paralyzed."</p>
               <p>And Mr. St. John sank back again, and was silent.</p>
               <p>An expression of real pain diffused itself over Mr. Alston's countenance, and
                  gazing at his friend, he said,</p>
               <p>"Harry, you afflict me to the heart."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry."</p>
               <p>"And I groan! How can you yield to this infatuation?"</p>
               <p>"Infatuation?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, 't is nothing more."</p>
               <p>St. John looked at his friend.</p>
               <p>"Do you think me infatuated after going and seeing for yourself?" he said.</p>
               <p>"Seeing for myself?" asked Mr. Alston.</p>
               <p>"Yes; are there many of those jessamines left under the window?"</p>
               <p>And Mr. St. John pointed to a flower in Mr. Alston's button hole, plucked at
                  Vanely as he departed.</p>
               <p>"That reminds me of a little flower I pulled one day at Jamestown island," added
                  the young man, "a long, long time ago."</p>
               <p>And he was silent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston looked at his friend with the same expression of pain, and said,</p>
               <p>"I see you have divined my movements. Well, I have been to Vanely."</p>
               <p>"And traveled all night to come and comfort a poor devil, your friend. Thanks,
                  Tom."</p>
               <p>"You have hit it. I come to comfort you."</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John shook his head.</p>
               <p>"You wish to make me think you have something to tell me which will raise my
                  spirits. But 't is impossible. All 's at an end."</p>
               <p>And Mr. St. John sank back again, silent and despairing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston seemed touched to the very depths of his nature by this agony of his
                  friend; it almost silenced him, for he scarcely hoped to make any impression upon
                  one so resolute in his despair. He nevertheless collected all his strength, and
                  commenced the assault.</p>
               <p>We shall not repeat the conversation, for it consisted only of a description, in
                  all their details and ramifications, of the events which have been described in
                  Mr. St. John's letters. From these letters, with the reply of Mr. Alston, the
                  reader will gather exactly what the present interview concerned itself with. On
                  one side, arguments against imaginary influences, presentiments and superstitions;
                  on the other, either silence or indifferent replies. Then came the question of the
                  young girl's change; and here, too, Mr. Alston dwelt upon the same views which he
                  had expressed in his letter—maidenly modesty and indisposition. Mr. St. John only
                  shook his head, making no reply.</p>
               <p>"For Heaven's sake, Harry!" said his friend, "do n't meet<pb n="340-341"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000171"/> my arguments with that eternal gesture of simple
                  dissent. Really you are not open to conviction, for here, after two hours'
                  discussion, you seem absolutely more than ever determined to despair; you hug your
                  wretchedness and resist every attempt I make to remove it."</p>
               <p>"It hugs me," said St. John, groaning.</p>
               <p>"Because you invite it to do so. Look away from it."</p>
               <p>"I can not."</p>
               <p>"Have I then been merely wasting my time?"</p>
               <p>"I am afraid so, Tom, alas! I hear your heart rather than your head speak to me.
                  You wish to cheer me, but you have nothing to offer me. For what is the sum of
                  your argument? You tell me that you have been to Vanely, that you have adroitly
                  sounded the whole family, and you tell me their replies to your questions. My
                  uncle, you say, in reply to one of your allusions to me, expressed himself well
                  pleased that I was to become his son; Aunt Mabel loved me in spite of my faults;
                  Miss Seraphina, like uncle and aunt, saw nothing, and looked forward to the
                  wedding. Helen alone saw the cloud, but was guarded in her speech, and mentioned
                  indisposition as the cause of her change; lastly, she herself being flatly and
                  earnestly interrogated, replied with——what? 'I am very sorry that my manner has
                  wounded Cousin Henry's feelings; I have not been well lately, Mr. Alston.' There,
                  Tom, that is but the old story. You have in vain attempted to lift the burden of
                  despair weighing me down. I thank you, I recognize your friendship; it is a gloomy
                  pleasure to me, but I remain unchanged—all 's over."</p>
               <p>And St. John covered his face, and uttered a moan which made honest Tom Alston
                  turn away his head and remain for some time silent.</p>
               <p>After a while Mr. Alston returned again to the subject; but this time, with less
                  vehemence, and a more quiet earnestness. His object now was to persuade his friend
                  to return.</p>
               <p>St. John shook his head.</p>
               <p>"Why should I?" he said; "it will only make two persons more miserable still."</p>
               <p>"And you thus relinquish, without a struggle, the happiness of your whole
                  life?"</p>
               <p>"I must!" said St. John, with a cruel groan.</p>
               <p>"You must not, Harry!" said Tom Alston, almost groaning too; "I tell you, you must
                  not! As your friend, as your companion and playmate in childhood and youth, and
                  your friend now in manhood, I beseech you to consider this! By returning no more,
                  you at once break off all connection with those who love you and whom you love! By
                  going thither no more, you end for ever all affection which they have for you. At
                  present no one but Helen observes any thing strange; your uncle and aunt will
                  resent your action, and banish you from their hearts. I beseech you to think what
                  you are doing, and not wreck the whole happiness of your future life on a
                  chimerical fancy, which may be a mere dream!"</p>
               <p>At the end of an hour, during which Tom Alston thus dwelt upon the effects of such
                  a proceeding as his friend had decided on, with the greatest earnestness—at the
                  end of this long and elaborate expostulation, St. John, weak and undecided,
                  promised to think of the matter. Tom Alston pushed his advantage, and ere long
                  forced from his friend a promise that he would make a final attempt to penetrate
                  the mystery.</p>
               <p>"Yes, you have overcome me," said the young man, rising, with a slight color in
                  his pale cheek; "I will go again, and I will take this with me."</p>
               <p>As he spoke, he drew from the breast pocket of his doublet a folded paper, on the
                  face of which a slash or cut running through the direction, "Henry St. John,
                  Esquire," was plainly visible.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Tom," said the young man, suppressing a weary sigh, "I will follow your
                  advice, and make a last attempt. Look at this letter, it is one which she wrote me
                  some days before my duel with Lindon, and it turned his sword point. I will go to
                  her and say, 'It was a loyal heart which your<pb n="342-343"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000172"/> letter saved from being pierced and torn asunder;
                  the heart which it now covers is as loyal. If an enemy has spoken against me, tell
                  me what he has said, and I will answer it; and not punish him if you wish it.' I
                  will go and say that and beseech her to not leave me in despair. You are right,
                  Tom, propriety at least requires that from me."</p>
               <p>And the young man finished with an expression of mingled despair and disdain which
                  was painful to behold.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston was, however, too much pleased with the determination of his friend to
                  feel longer pained. He replied, with a cheerful look,</p>
               <p>"Be easy, Harry. All will come out right; you have determined most manfully. I
                  confess there is much to afflict any one in this matter, but you have only to
                  oppose yourself to the obstacle like a valorous chevalier, and all will be well.
                  You say this little flower in my button-hole reminds you of that one you plucked
                  when you were wounded, as you told me at Flower of Hundreds. Well, take this
                  flower, and add to your former address, 'When I was wounded and bleeding, fainting
                  and unable to stand up, one day, I thought of you more than my wound, and plucked
                  a flower such as you had plucked on the very same spot, and even when I lost my
                  senses clung to it, and thought of you.' Add that to your speech, Harry, and if
                  you do not move her, and make her return to her old affection, then I will really
                  sympathise with you, for I shall have reason."</p>
               <p>Having thus terminated the discussion, and extracting from his friend a promise
                  that, within three days at farthest, he would carry out his design of visiting
                  Vanely, Mr. Tom Alston declared himself extremely hungry, and the friends
                  proceeded to the Raleigh and breakfasted. St. John scarcely touched his food, and
                  had never changed his expression of cold despair.</p>
               <p>An hour afterwards he bade his friend good-bye, and they separated—Mr. Alston to
                  return to Moorefield, where he was to receive a letter from his friend; Mr. St.
                  John to seek his lounge, where he now spent hour after hour steeped in gloomy
                  reverie.</p>
               <p>His friend's visit had been like a ripple on the surface of a dark tarn—the waters
                  again closed over its gloomy depths, silent and motionless.</p>

               <p>"I HAVE followed your advice, and made the journey which you suggested, carrying
                  with me the letter, and intending to add what you advised me to add to my address. </p>
               <p>"I write because I promised to write, though the ink is somewhat faded. Strange!
                  that the merchants of Williamsburg will not provide the gentlemen of the colony,
                  who deal with them, something better than this pale, watery fluid, which can
                  hardly be seen! I shall purchase no more of it, depending for the future upon
                  London.</p>
               <p>"I feel somewhat badly this morning, which I suppose is attributable to the fact
                  that I traveled all night, as a friend of mine did a long time ago, when he came
                  in early one morning. Why, what am I writing? It was yourself—was it not? My head
                  is a little disordered this morning, and my memory is bad. As I said, I traveled
                  all last night.</p>
               <p>"What have I written? Is my mind failing? Why, I am writing to Tom Alston! We
                  talked of this—assuredly we did! I told you of this visit to Colonel Vane's, in
                  Prince George—did I not? I told you I was going to see—her. I told you I would
                  write, or I dream!</p>
               <p>"I have this moment returned. Oh, Tom! it all flashes on me now; I have my senses
                  again, which were stunned. I went and she would not see me; she refused to meet
                  me. I am broken-hearted! My head pains me—something troubles me; is the weather
                  turning cold again? Strange, at this season!</p>

                  GEORGE.</head>
               <div type="letter">
                  <p>"IS it wrong for me to write to you? We were cousins once, with some affection
                     for each other—I at least for you. I do not add that we have ever been any
                     thing more, for that would doubtless wound and offend you. I would not wound or
                     offend you; I am too unhappy to think of reproaches. Once I might have given
                     way to my passionate temperament, and uttered wild words; now I have no such
                     words to utter. I acquiesce in all you do and say, and scarcely dare to write
                     these lines—to my cousin, as it were.</p>
                  <p>"My memory has been impaired of late, but I think we were playmates in our
                     youth, were we not? Are not you the Bonnybel of my childhood? She was very
                     lovely, and had the kindest and tenderest heart, and a face full of the most
                     delicate loveliness. I have been thinking about her, and you must not think me
                     unmanly because the tears come to my eyes. I do not think any one ever loved
                     Bonnybel as I did. She seemed to me like an angel, holding out her pure white
                     hands and blessing me. I used to weave flowers for her, and once she showed me
                     the wreath, a long time afterwards—she had kept it for my sake, she said.</p>
                  <p>"I believe I am wandering from what I intended to write. I have been sick, but
                     am very well to-day. My friend, Tom Alston, has been to see me in my sickness,
                     and he has taken up the strangest idea, he thinks that we have quarreled—you
                     and myself. Could any thing be more absurd? Ordinary persons quarrel and fall
                     out, but the very idea of Bonnybel and Harry being any thing but friends! I
                     told him that it was absolutely silly, and the grounds of his opinion are the
                     silliest part of it. He thinks, because you were unwell the other day, when I
                     was at Vanely, and did not come down, that for this reason you do not like me.
                     I wrote him word, on my return that night, or rather early in the morning, for
                     I preferred traveling in the night, as the weather was warm—I wrote him word
                     about the visit, and said I had not seen you, because you were sick. My letter
                     had scarcely reached Moorefield, I thought, when he broke into my chamber here
                     in the strangest manner, with tears in his eyes, crying, most singularly, 'O,
                     Harry! Harry!' and sitting down with his hands over his face. He then came and
                     put his arm around me and asked me how I felt, as though I had been sick. I was
                     not at all sick then, but became unwell that evening, strange to say; I believe
                     it was on account of his visit. He persuaded me that I must be sick, or I never
                     would have written him such a letter, when my letter was the simplest in the
                     world, and just such as I generally write to him. A physician came to see me,
                     and he and Tom went out just now together. I have risen from the sofa, to write
                     to you.</p>
                  <p>"I believe I am not quite well this morning, and I have a strange feeling, as
                     if we had quarreled. Write to me, darling, and tell me that you still love me.
                     My whole heart is wrapped up in you, and I can not breathe without your love.
                     How kind and good in the merciful Creator to give me your love. I have been
                     very ungrateful not to thank him, and obey his commands, but I will try in
                     future to be better. I expect much from your love, I think it will make me
                     purer and better. I do not love you only because your face is beautiful, but
                     because you are pure and good. When we are married, I shall be far better, and
                     you will have made me so.</p>
                  <p>"They spoke of something which had come between us. Is it not strange? Why,
                     what <emph>could</emph> ever separate us? There was a strange man who hinted at
                     something of this sort, I remember, but how foolish.</p>
                  <p>"I have not seen you for some days now, but I will come soon. I am a little
                     unwell to-day, but I am happy, thinking of you.</p>
                  <pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC6146-00000174"/>
                  <p>"There 's Tom Alston's step upon the stairs, and he must not see me writing to
                     you; I can not write to you in company, as I can not speak to you when others
                     are present. We must be alone, darling, to address each other as we wish. I can
                     not call you by <emph>your name</emph> in society, and I can not even write it
                     when another's present.</p>
                  <p>"They are near the door now, Tom and his friend, and I must close my letter,
                     which my servant shall carry to the post office when they are gone.</p>
                  <p>"Write to me very soon, my own Bonnybel, and a good long letter, such as you
                     used to send me over to 'Flower of Hundreds,' when I was detained.</p>

                     from their eyes. They affect to think that I am sick, and even say that writing
                     and reading will be injurious. How strange it is that intelligent men like Tom
                     and the doctor, do not understand that I am merely a little fatigued and
                     indisposed from want of rest and working at the plans for 'Flower of Hundreds.'
                     I have devised a very pretty wing, I think, such as you said you liked when we
                     looked at the old house from the hill in front. You did not know that you were
                     describing your preference to a company of invisible architects. The addition
                     will contain a sitting-room for you, a smaller library, looking out upon the
                     lawn, and two guest chambers. I am sure you will like it, and you know I only
                     live to please you. Farewell."</p>

               <p>THREE days after this letter was dispatched, Mr. Alston, who was now permanently
                  residing at the Raleigh tavern, entered his friend's chamber, after breakfast, and
                  found him holding in his hand a paper which his eyes were fixed upon as though
                  riveted to it by iron chains.</p>
               <p>The sound of his footsteps did not arouse Mr. St. John, who continued to gaze at
                  the paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston approached, and, without ceremony, looked over the young man's
                  shoulder.</p>
               <p>As his eyes ran over the letter, all color forsook his cheek, a sort of tremor
                  passed through his frame, and leaning one hand on the back of the carved chair, he
                  remained silent and motionless.</p>
               <p>The letter was in the following words:</p>

                           <p>"I have received your strange letter, in which you speak of our union,

                              say, by myself. It was not my intention to make such suggestions, and

               <p>Mr. Alston went and sat down at some distance, and with eyes hollow and red from
                  want of rest, watched the young man, the very sight of whose figure seemed to send
                  a pang through his honest heart.</p>
               <p>St. John remained for nearly an hour perfectly motionless, his shoulders drooping,
                  his head bent down, his eyes fixed upon the floor, across which a long bar of
                  sunshine ran like a stream of gold.</p>
               <p>"It was a glorious sail we had upon the river," he at length murmured with a
                  smile. "What a day it was!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston half rose, but fell back in his seat.</p>
               <p>"The sky was so blue, and the sun shone so brightly!" continued St. John,
                  laughing. "Even now I remember how the foam danced along, far whiter than the
                  wings of the sea birds who hovered over us! What a happy time! They may talk of
                  the great wide ocean, but there 's nothing like our stately river—nothing! It runs
                  from the mountains of Virginia to the east, and Virginia is the fairest of all
                  lands, is it not? How the foam danced before us, and the winds were blowing! The
                  air was perfumed by the forest as we sailed!"</p>
               <p>"Harry! Harry!" murmured Tom Alston, in a stifled voice.</p>
               <p>"Ah! are you there, friend?" said the young man, turning gayly, "are you there,
                  good mine host of the Raleigh tavern? 'T is a fine tavern, and a stranger told me
                  they were making history there—ah! is it so? But we'll not mind them. Bring me
                  some sherry, host—or stay! let it be Canary. 'Tis a gentleman's wine, and I am a
                  gentleman—though a poor one: very, very poor!"</p>
               <p>And the head sank.</p>
               <p>"Are we in the capitol?" he murmured, smiling as before. "I am a stranger, but it
                  seems that I have been here once before! One night, when the violins played, and I
                  danced a minuet with some one—who could she have been?"</p>
               <p>And with the air of a man who tries to recall something, Mr. St. John touched his
                  forehead and was silent.</p>
               <p>"Well, well, well!" he murmured at length, in a low, measured voice, "I can not
                  remember—it was very long ago. How long, good host? A decade? Well, well, well—'t
                  was a merry time, I think. What a noble gift is memory!"</p>
               <p>And with the same musing smile, both sad and joyous, the young man raised his
                  head. The colored drawing on the opposite wall attracted his attention—the drawing
                  purchased for its chance likeness to Bonnybel—that which he had selected on the
                  night of the assembly, with the words "The fallen salutes his victor."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" he murmured, "who is that, mine host? Is the wine coming? Who is that—a fair
                  face, I think!"</p>
               <p>"He does not even recognize Bonnybel!" muttered Tom Alston, covering his face,
                  with a sob.</p>
               <p>Only the last word caught the young man's wandering attention.</p>
               <p>"Bonnybel!" he murmured, "did you say Bonnybel was her name? How strange! I knew a
                  Bonnybel once: she was very beautiful and tender. Eyes bright and of the tenderest
                  violet; hair a soft brown, and the very same lips—the same, as I live! But no, no,
                  no! that picture is not like her. She was truer looking than that portrait—answer
                  me not, sir! Who says she was false? Do you wear a sword? I who stand here am
                  Henry St. John, of Prince George, in Virginia!"</p>
               <p>And an expression of haughty anger drove all smiles from the wan face.</p>
               <p>"Oh, me! oh, me!" was all Tom Alston could repeat, in a voice stifled with
                  emotion.</p>
               <p>St. John continued for some moments gazing wildly at the picture, and, as he
                  gazed, a shudder ran through his frame, his eyes expanded with a sort of dread,
                  and, rising violently from his seat, he drew his sword, shouting:</p>
               <p>"Who are you that stand beside the picture of my love and darken it? Away! I have
                  seen you before, with your burning eyes, and I defy you! I will meet you breast to
                  breast!—back!"</p>
               <pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6146-00000176"/>
               <p>And with a fiery flash from his haughty eyes, the young man cut at the air with
                  his sword.</p>
               <p>Tom Alston ran to him, and, sobbing like a child, put his arms round him, and with
                  gentle force compelled him to sit down again.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Harry! Harry! my poor, poor Harry!" he sobbed, "'t is only your fancy: there
                  is no one in the room. Oh, Heaven! that it should come to this!"</p>
               <p>St. John looked with a dreamy, absent air into the face of his friend, and then
                  turned away.</p>
               <p>His momentary excitement soon disappeared, and, reclining now against the tall,
                  carved back of his chair, his shoulders drooped, and he traced figures idly with
                  the point of his scabbard on the floor.</p>
               <p>As he did so, his excitement seemed completely dissipated, and, with a smile, he
                  murmured to himself:</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes! she is very beautiful and faithful! Who says she 's not?—poor creature,
                  unworthy of my steel! Is that a flower you hold in your hand? I have seen that
                  rose before—it is white. Were there not red roses too? Did you tell me that you
                  loved me? Oh, how dearly I love <emph>you!</emph> Is your name Bonnybel? I knew
                  one once like you—she was very good and beautiful—but she died, and flowers are
                  growing from her bosom. Do I dream? Oh, me! Is she dead, then—my own girl? Is she
                  dead, then—my own faithful girl? Oh, no! I should not be alive to ask you!—that
                  was another! You are my own dear Bonnybel, are you not? You hold the flower in
                  your hand, and smile. You have the dearest eyes, and your hair is gold in the
                  sunlight. Do you love me? I shall die if you do not love me! There is the
                  moon!—take care or your horse will stumble!—Oh, to die now since I have pressed
                  your lips, with your head on my bosom, with that light in your eyes!—my own
                  faithful, noble girl!"</p>
               <p>And with an expression of the most radiant happiness, the young man fixed his eyes
                  upon the image of his memory, and remained thus, lost in his reverie of joy and
                  delight.</p>
               <p>At five paces from him, his friend followed every movement, caught every murmur.
                  With a heaving bosom, and with eyes wet with tears, honest Tom Alston, whom the
                  world called fop and derided, watched, wofully, the progress of the delirium.</p>
               <p>At last he breathed more freely, his eyes turned eagerly toward the door. He heard
                  the step of the old physician slowly ascending, and he soon entered.</p>
               <p>A single glance at Mr. St. John told him all: he shook his head.</p>
               <p>"He has a brain fever," said the old doctor, "produced by mental excitement,
                  exposure to the sun, after sickness, perhaps, and loss of rest; of course chiefly
                  by the former. The sooner he is in bed the better, Mr. Alston. Ring for a servant,
                  and give orders that no person whatever be admitted."</p>
               <p>A powerful opiate was administered to the young man, and he slept for some
                  hours.</p>
               <p>When he awoke, it was to toss and rave, deliriously, from a violent brain fever,
                  as the old physician had predicted.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER LXVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE LAST HALLUCINATION OF ST. JOHN.</head>
               <p>FOR more than two weeks, Mr. St. John remained thus prostrated in body and mind,
                  by the burning delirium which had seized upon him.</p>
               <p>The strong nature had been too heavily taxed—the vigorous mind had succumbed
                  beneath the vast pressure of the weight of grief and agony—completely prostrated
                  now, the young man was but the wreck of himself—and, from the delirious ravings
                  which shook his thin frame, seemed to be possessed by but one absorbing
                  thought—his love.</p>
               <pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC6146-00000177"/>
               <p>He would ramble on thus for hours, his memory returning to all the happy scenes of
                  the past: and looking at times into the face of Tom Alston, who scarcely ever left
                  his side, he would speak of her with an accent of such tenderness, that the honest
                  fellow had to turn away his head to hide the tears in his eyes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston had found that one of the most soothing medicines, so to speak,
                  consisted in holding before his friend's eyes the picture resembling Bonnybel;—and
                  in order that the sick man might have the full benefit of the painting, its
                  position had been changed to the wall in front of the foot of the bed.</p>
               <p>The young man did not seem to associate with the girl thus brought to his mind, a
                  single event of a sorrowful nature. It was the Bonnybel of the happy past which he
                  gazed at with pensive pleasure; and he would lie thus for hours, gazing in silence
                  at the picture, or speaking to it.</p>
               <p>At last the crisis of his malady came, and seated at the side of the bed, Tom
                  Alston and the old physician followed every indication of the disease. Life and
                  death seemed to wrestle over the young man's body—but life conquered. From the
                  brink of the grave he returned to life, and with every hour now, to his friends'
                  inexpressible delight, he grew better.</p>
               <p>One morning Mr. Alston had taken advantage of the favorable condition of his
                  friend, to go and get some sleep. He had nearly broken himself down, this honest
                  fop, by those vigils at the bedside of his friend night after night; and yielding
                  at last to the doctor's expostulations, he went to the Raleigh and slept.</p>
               <p>St. John sank into a gentle slumber soon after his friend's departure; and he had
                  a happy dream, he thought.</p>
               <p>It seemed to him that he was awake and gazing at the picture resembling Bonnybel,
                  when the door opened noiselessly, a light footfall rustled on the carpet, and the
                  figure on the wall, as he continued to gaze, slowly became living, advanced from
                  its frame, and stood at the foot of the bed, looking at him.</p>
               <p>A change, however, seemed to have taken place in the features. The picture was
                  happy and smiling, while the figure of his imagination gazed at him with
                  inexpressible sadness, sobbing and permitting large tears to escape unheeded, as
                  the eyes continued to survey him.</p>
               <p>Then as though to perfect the vision, another figure advanced to the side of the
                  first; and the young man recognized the sad face of Helen, weeping like the image
                  of her sister.</p>
               <p>The figures stood thus for some moments, motionless and silent, except for the low
                  sobs; and then slowly separating, right and left, they came to the side of his
                  bed.</p>
               <p>The figure of Bonnybel sank into a chair, and the head drooped until it rested
                  upon the bed. Her companion also sank down, and for some minutes he seemed to hear
                  low sobs, of inexpressible sorrow, dying away one after another in the
                  silence.</p>
               <p>He tried to move and speak, and bid the vision not sob so; but he could not. An
                  influence, gentle and yet all powerful, seemed to paralyze his limbs.</p>
               <p>Then the figure of Bonnybel slowly raised its head, and he saw that the eyes were
                  red with weeping; and turning his head, he perceived that the other image wept
                  also.</p>
               <p>As he looked, he felt a soft warm hand encircle his wrist, a tear fell upon it;
                  and this was followed by a kiss which the figure Bonnybel pressed upon his thin,
                  pale hand.</p>
               <p>He tried again to move, but could not.</p>
               <p>And then he saw the figures rise, stand for an instant gazing at him with grief
                  too deep for words; and then they seemed slowly to disappear, and the picture on
                  the wall smiled as before.</p>
               <p>From that time he grew rapidly better—the disease retreated, and the color began
                  to return to his cheek. Life again infused itself like a subtle liquid into all
                  the cells of his being, and his eyes every hour grew clearer.</p>
               <pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC6146-00000178"/>
               <p>At last he rose, and as before, at "Flower of Hundreds," lay beneath the window
                  inhaling the fresh breeze and basking in the sunshine; and finally, Tom Alston,
                  with the doctor's permission, drove him out. On the next morning, after a sound
                  sleep, the young man was well.</p>
               <p>Nothing remained of his illness but a slight paleness and a settled melancholy.
                  The old physician could cure the body, but he could not minister to the mind
                  diseased.</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John was entirely uncomplaining now—he was also entirely hopeless.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER LXVII.</head>
               <head type="sub">HOW ST. JOHN KEPT HIS APPOINTMENT WITH THE STRANGER.</head>
               <p>THREE days after the morning ride of the friends, and about midnight, a man was
                  seated in the upper room of the tall house pointed out by the stranger to St.
                  John, and bending over a great table covered with papers, was writing rapidly.</p>
               <p>It was the stranger himself.</p>
               <p>He was clad in the same sable suit—his face was pale and earnest as before—and he
                  was writing by the light of a single candle which sent its feeble glimmer far
                  across the roofs of the houses—a solitary sentinel, in its watch-tower, over the
                  sleeping town.</p>
               <p>The stranger continued writing for half an hour without raising his head; but at
                  the end of that time, a footstep upon the winding stair-case attracted his
                  attention.</p>
               <p>He listened as the step ascended, and went to the door, which he threw open.</p>
               <p>He found himself opposite to Mr. St. John.</p>
               <p>"Ah! it is you, friend!" he said; "welcome! And yet I grieve to see you—if—"</p>
               <p>And a look of inquiry ended the sentence.</p>
               <p>St. John inclined his head, slowly, and took the seat toward which the stranger
                  motioned him.</p>
               <p>"I reply to your unuttered question," said the young man, calmly; "yes, I have
                  come to seek you, as you predicted I would come. It is to do my duty—to try at
                  least. I am ready to do all that a broken-hearted man may do—a poor gentleman. You
                  were right; I am miserable, utterly so—you triumph."</p>
               <p>Having thus spoken in a tone of gloomy, but uncomplaining despair, the young man
                  leaned upon the table, and lowered his eyes.</p>
               <p>The stranger looked at him long and intently, without speaking. Then taking his
                  cold hand and pressing it,</p>
               <p>"You will not think me insincere when I tell you, sir," he said, "that your
                  unhappiness deeply afflicts me. I will not be guilty of the bad taste of asking
                  its nature, of probing your wounds afresh, and making you suffer for the
                  gratification of my curiosity. It is enough for me to know that you are grieved,
                  and I most sincerely sympathize with you, and, if possible, would endeavor to
                  console you."</p>
               <p>There was great dignity in the air of the stranger, as he spoke, and that
                  sincerity which springs from a superior nature, but the young man only shook his
                  head, and muttered some inaudible thanks.</p>
               <p>"So let it be then, friend," said the stranger, "I shall ask you no questions and
                  offer no common-place consolations. Will you permit me, however, to make one
                  observation before we dismiss the subject?"</p>
               <p>"Willingly."</p>
               <p>"Do you remember one day when we dined in your private apartment at the Raleigh
                  tavern?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, perfectly," said St. John.</p>
               <p>"Do you remember observing my silence and abstraction?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"To end my questions—do you recall that history of<pb n="356-357"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000179"/> my life which I related in the old church at
                  Richmond town?"</p>
               <p>"I shall not forget it."</p>
               <p>"Well, friend," said the stranger, calmly, "the apartment to which you conducted
                  me, in the Raleigh tavern, was the one which <emph>she</emph> occupied, when I
                  knew her first—the woman who was more to me than life. There first I saw her,
                  there she moved about, and sat, and read, and smiled; there first her head rested
                  on my breast, and I heard her heart speak to me. Well, I thus entered that room
                  again at your invitation, after years of absence, and I recognized, perfectly,
                  every detail of the apartment—the windows, the old mirror above the fireplace, the
                  very andirons, and the crack in the plaster of the wall. Here she had sat down and
                  looked at me so kindly, there she had stood with the breeze lifting her curls,
                  yonder she had leaned one white arm on the moulding—I saw all, and lived through
                  the whole past again. You observed my abstraction, I remember; you gazed at me as
                  I leaned on the table, and left the wine untasted, and mused."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I saw all that, sir," said St. John, "and I feel for you."</p>
               <p>"Let me finish, friend; it is not idly that I recall all this. I say that there,
                  in that apartment, I thus recalled to my mind the grand hours of my life, when my
                  horizon was all sunshine, and the sad present was set, like a black figure,
                  against that dead sunlight. Well, I did not groan and sob, turn pale, and cover my
                  face. I looked, in turn, upon every object; I traversed the whole past with a
                  single glance, and then I returned to the subject we had been discussing, without
                  emotion. Do you understand?"</p>
               <p>St John inclined his head, calmly.</p>
               <p>"You wish to console me," he said. "I thank you."</p>
               <p>"I wish, indeed, to say to you that the lapse of time slowly wears away the
                  deepest impressions, that grief gradually disappears, that God finally leaves us
                  only that pensive sadness which surrounds the beloved and lost figure with a sort
                  of glory, contributing far more to our happiness than our misery."</p>
               <p>St. John remained silent.</p>
               <p>"I have said," added the stranger, "that I would not weary you, in your doubtless
                  great grief, with commonplace consolations. But I declare to you, friend, as the
                  result of the observation and experience of a life crammed with bitter and
                  corroding emotions—I declare to you, I say, as a proposition, a truth, which can
                  not be refuted, or modified in its application, that the merciful God, who has
                  made the creature man, does not design, nor will he permit grief to master us, the
                  clouds to overshadow us for ever. The gloom will disappear, the sun will again
                  shine, that hope which now flies from you for ever, as you imagine, will return,
                  and again you will be happy."</p>
               <p>St. John listened in the same gloomy silence, and said at last,</p>
               <p>"I know not if I even believe in a God, but I do in my destiny."</p>
               <p>The stranger looked sadly at his companion.</p>
               <p>"I thought the old Greek dogma had disappeared, friend," he said; "destiny is but
                  another word for chance, however opposite they may seem."</p>
               <p>"Well, I do not refuse that philosophy either."</p>
               <p>"Look at that flower on my table," said the stranger; "that alone refutes
                  you."</p>
               <p>"An apple blossom; yes, it is very pretty; simple, but delicate and
                  beautiful."</p>
               <p>"Simple?" said the stranger; "there, friend, you err; 't is a miracle of
                  complexity. Its history unfolds the spirit of the universe, and simple as that
                  flower may seem to you, the links of an invisible chain bind it to the throne of
                  the Eternal. Look at it with me; see these delicate petals, like rose-colored
                  velvet, the germ of the fruit in the middle of the star, the down on the leaf and
                  around the stem. A thousand trees shall grow upon a hundred hills, and no one
                  shall produce a different bloom, and if this be conceded,<pb n="358-359"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000180"/> friend, 't is violating reason to dub such
                  causality as is here apparent, with the name of chance. Chance might, if you
                  choose, originate this blossom, though I could never comprehend the meaning of the
                  word, even; but could a blind chance continue to produce? Let it be granted that
                  this wonderful trifle came by accident, could accident constantly renew it? Is it
                  not a mere contradiction, I ask you calmly, friend? To me it is evident that this
                  incessant reproduction, this fatal sequence, involves necessarily the existence of
                     <emph>law.</emph> The bough buds and blooms, the bloom falls away, the green
                  germ expands into a globe, striped or mottled, filled with juice, sour or sweet,
                  and the small seed of this globe possesses the reproductive power so perfectly
                  that with a handful you may plant a forest. Year after year that forest, in turn,
                  blossoms and bears fruit—what fruit? Why the same, absolutely the same, and the
                  existence of immutable <emph>law</emph> thus reveals itself. I see you
                  acquiesce.</p>
               <p>"Well now friend," continued the stranger, whose design seemed to be a diversion
                  of the young man's thoughts, "if this law does beyond doubt exist, how was it
                  established? Chaos as you know is the primal condition of matter—does order evolve
                  itself from chaos blindly? or can law itself rise from anarchy without a motor, a
                  fiat of some greater power? There must of necessity be something above chaos and
                  anarchy, to bring forth law and order. What must it be? Why a God. It seems to me,
                  friend, that the necessity for this Being is more fatally logical, armed with a
                  wedge more penetrating, than the Greek 'Necessity.'"</p>
               <p>"I did not mean to say that I doubted the existence of a supreme Being," said St.
                  John gloomily; "I only say that this Being, if he exists, has made my life
                  darkness."</p>
               <p>"How do you know that fact?"</p>
               <p>"My reason tells me so—to answer you philosophically," said St. John.</p>
               <p>"And what does your reason tell you about the atonement?"</p>
               <p>"It recoils."</p>
               <p>"I thought so. Well, friend, permit me to say that you reject these consolations
                  precisely because you reason as you do, with the head."</p>
               <p>"How should I?"</p>
               <p>"As a child does, with the heart."</p>
               <p>"Must I embrace blindly?" said the young man with gloomy calmness. "I can not do
                  that."</p>
               <p>"No one expects you to."</p>
               <p>"How then?"</p>
               <p>"With faith founded on reason—a 'reasonable faith.'"</p>
               <p>"Faith and reason are implacable enemies," said St. John struggling gloomily
                  against hope, "the encyclopædists prove that——"</p>
               <p>"Man is a machine. So they do, friend," interrupted the stranger. "Well they make
                  but sorry machines of us—I prefer one of wood and iron to their imaginary men. I
                  say that faith and reason, so far from being hostile, are inseparable;—true faith
                  and right reason, understand me, friend—else we wander. It is no quibble to say
                  you must exert faith to believe in reason—to comprehend what is really such. I do
                  not call a skepticism, springing from depravity of life, and warping mind and
                  heart, the triumph of reason. I say that the French idea of it is based at most on
                  science and philosophy miscalled; and the encyclopædists stumble in the dark, and
                  utter only broken words, for science and philosophy are progressive. Do you
                  comprehend the immense significance of this fact, friend? Undoubtedly both science
                  and philosophy are constantly advancing and unfolding—well, the philosophy
                  preached by Paul in the name of his Master, is perfect, finished, <emph>not</emph>
                  progressive. From Plato and Pythagoras, to Diderot and D'Alembert, the
                  philosophers of all nations have been speculating on the mystery of human
                  life—man's destiny; and those accomplished intellects, you must confess, have come
                  to different conclusions. They all appealed to science and philosophy, and their
                  systems have all been<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC6146-00000181"/> rejected—because
                  the child who succeeds the octogenarian knows more than the gray-haired
                  thinker—has the benefit of every new discovery, a sealed book to the generation
                  preceding him. That is undoubtedly the state of science. What is revelation, by
                  which term I mean of course the system of the 'Nazarene philosopher,' as says a
                  friend of mine? Is it either progressive or defective? More than seventeen hundred
                  years ago, from the depths of the East, where the paganism of the profligate
                  Romans mingled with the groveling hypocrisy of the debased Hebrews—from this
                  repulsive society of hard masters and cowering slaves, came a man of thirty,
                  announcing a new system. He was poor, and his followers were some fishermen from
                  the most <choice>
                     <sic>gnorant</sic>
                     <corr>ignorant</corr>
                  </choice> district of the country of Galilee. This man continued to disseminate
                  his views for three years, and then the Hebrews, whom he arraigned as hypocrites,
                  procured his execution as a seditious person, in the Roman manner—by crucifixion.
                  What was the system of this young philosopher, the philosophy originating in the
                  most debased age and people of which history speaks? Friend, you may read it in
                  the book called by that Greek word itself—the Bible. If you do not see that the
                  model therein given is superior to the highest development of holiness found in
                  the purest ages and the most enlightened countries, you must read without the
                  student's mind. As I have said over and over, human philosophy is progressive, and
                  consequently defective; the divine system is not progressive, because it is
                  perfect. It has not advanced one step for seventeen hundred years, and is still
                  immeasurably in advance of our purer civilization. Is that not plain? Look at it
                  as a statesman searching for the means of leading a great land to happiness and
                  glory; then say if you can doubt that if the precepts of the Nazarene
                  philosopher—I mean love and charity—were the common law, the world would touch the
                  summit of her splendor, her peace and joy? Year by year, the world has advanced to
                  higher heights under the banner bearing that rude instrument on which the Founder
                  was executed—the Cross drives the powers of darkness before its triumphal march.
                  Thus the earth blossoms every year with purer flowers; but where is the individual
                  whose life has approached the great Exemplar's? He was a poor youth, reared up in
                  the midst of the superstition, cruelty, and debasement of a pagan land and nation.
                  You, a Virginia gentleman of the eighteenth century can not touch the threshold of
                  this majestic temple, where truth and goodness sit like queens. I finish by
                  saying, that if there is any cause and effect, the system can not be of human
                  origin. I would rather believe the miracles recorded in that book than credit the
                  idea that the man who founded its system was merely a man—a system which, after
                  two thousand years nearly, soars above the onward march of the nations, and
                  remains unapproached and unapproachable. Reason shifts and changes, and the
                  philosophy of to-day is the byword of the morrow. This revelation alone does not
                  change—because man eternally requires the same consolation, just this, and this
                  alone—and so it will be to the end. Friend, there are times when the cold reason
                  brings but sorry consolation. When the heart is broken with grief, the spirit
                  weary and worn by sorrow, the eye dim, and the blood cold, at such times we do not
                  read the encyclopædia. We then feel that the heart is greater than the
                  intellect—that after all we are not machines—we find in faith that rest which the
                  wounded seek when they drag their bleeding limbs from the battle field. I ask for
                  the healing balm, and will not listen to Voltaire who stands by and sneers, and
                  tries to persuade me that it is a nostrum. And now pardon me for these many words;
                  my excuse is that they are true."</p>
               <p>"There is nothing for me to pardon," said St. John, in the same cold and gloomy
                  tone; "I should rather return you my thanks, friend. I see plainly that your
                  object is to console me in my affliction. I only regret that 't is impossible.
                  Whatever I may have in the future, I have now no faith like yours. I lament it,
                  but I can not help it. Let me not<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC6146-00000182"/>
                  longer trespass on your time than is absolutely necessary. You were writing?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said the stranger, abandoning the subject, as his companion desired, "I was
                  at work."</p>
               <p>"And I interrupt you."</p>
               <p>"No, it is not interruption to see friends, whatever having others by me may be.
                  The mind gathers strength and elasticity from rest. My pamphlet will end with
                  greater vigor for your visit."</p>
               <p>And the stranger lifted one of the sheets and ran his eye over it with that
                  comprehensive glance peculiar to authors.</p>
               <p>"I have nearly finished," he said.</p>
               <p>"What is it?" asked St. John, who had never for a moment lost his cold and gloomy
                  air, and seemed indeed to move and speak like a lifeless automaton; "is it
                  revolutionary?"</p>
               <p>"You shall judge for yourself."</p>
               <p>And the stranger pointed to a rough printed sheet of proof. Mr. St. John read,</p>
               <p>"THOUGHTS ON THE PRESENT ASPECT OF AFFAIRS, BY A MAN OF THE TIMES."</p>
               <p>As he was reading the commencement of the pamphlet, a tap at the door announced a
                  visitor, and without waiting for permission, a printer's boy entered.</p>
               <p>The stranger handed him the pages of MS., and he retired as silently as he had
                  come.</p>
               <p>St. John, for a moment interrupted, again returned to the pamphlet, and having
                  read the two or three sheets, said, as he laid them down,</p>
               <p>"That seems to me treason, friend—it will be seized."</p>
               <p>"No," said the stranger.</p>
               <p>"Why not?"</p>
               <p>"At least if it is seized, that ceremony will take place in a thousand separate
                  localities throughout Virginia."</p>
               <p>"You do not publish here then?"</p>
               <p>"No, 't is only printed here."</p>
               <p>"And scattered by your agents?"</p>
               <p>The stranger nodded.</p>
               <p>St. John reflected for some moments without speaking, and then said,</p>
               <p>"I came to offer you a gift for the cause, friend. 'T is twenty thousand pounds,
                  in valid securities, for which I will take your receipt."</p>
               <p>The young man uttered these words as coldly as before, and then waited for the
                  stranger's reply.</p>
               <p>That reply was a refusal of the money, on the ground that the association would
                  not consent to impoverish its friends even for the general good. The stranger
                  presented his view at great length and earnestly, but St. John did not seem in the
                  least moved by his arguments.</p>
               <p>"Well, friend," he said, with gloomy calmness and the same measured,
                  automaton-like movement of the head, "well, be it as you wish. I can not force you
                  to accept the gift I offer; but I forewarn you that this refusal will be injurious
                  to me, perhaps fatal, if I do not forestall its effects. You look at me with
                  curiosity, and my words even seem to cause you concern; well, I will respond to
                  the silent question of your eyes; I will speak plainly as you formerly spoke; I
                  will explain my meaning, and the action I have taken."</p>
               <p>St. John paused a moment, and suppressed the groan which struggled for
                  utterance—in an instant he was again calm.</p>
               <p>"Since I last saw you, friend," he said, coldly, "I have suffered a misfortune
                  which henceforth renders me the victim of an incurable despair. I shall only say,
                  upon this point, that my despair proceeds from the changed relations of a woman
                  who is no longer the same to me, and has broken my heart. 'T is almost a piece of
                  cant, the phrase which I use, but it is true. You will easily understand, after
                  these words, that I can not remain where I was once happy. I can not look upon the
                  objects which were familiar to me and to her, without breaking my heart daily, and
                  opening afresh my almost mortal wounds. I fear to do so. I think my frame, already
                  much weakened by illness, would succumb<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC6146-00000183"/>
                  cumb. I shall therefore go away from these scenes; I shall never again look upon
                  them. I have just perfected the arrangements by which my whole property is
                  alienated, my intention being to leave Virginia for ever. I have executed, in the
                  first place, a deed by which my old and faithful servants, with their entire
                  families, are conveyed in fee simple to a gentleman living near me, my uncle—one
                  who has been a most tender father to me in my orphanage, refusing absolutely to
                  accept the least return for his kindness, or even so much as repayment of his
                  expenditures on my account. This deed is properly drawn, and my uncle will have no
                  choice in the matter, for I shall be dead, as it were, and it is in fact a bequest
                  by my last will and testament. Well, there was so much taken from the cause, but I
                  did not dream of any other course. My real estate remained, and that is all free
                  from incumbrance. See these papers—they are approved securities from the
                  purchaser, Mr. A. Z. Smith, of this town. At the moment when he affixed his name
                  to them, I felt almost relieved, for, from that instant I should no longer look
                  upon scenes which it tears my very soul to approach now. You spoke of that room at
                  the Raleigh, friend; you say you were simply sad. With me it is different, for
                  there is a room yonder in my house, which would strangle me with memories should I
                  enter it, were I not to faint and fall on the threshold.</p>
               <p>"But I wander. Let me say what I intended. I thus hold in my hand the purchase
                  money of my manor house and plantation, but it will not remain by me long. It
                  shall not be the accursed temptation in my grasp, corrupting me, and leading me to
                  those desperate courses by which men most frequently try to drown despair. No, I
                  am resolved, friend. I will not retain the means of drugging myself with sensual
                  poison, and of thus slowly slipping, as it were, into the gulf of perdition. I
                  know myself well enough to understand that I require rough medicine, if indeed any
                  medicine at all exists, for my disease. I must wrestle with the hard world if I
                  would retain even my faith of gentleman, if I would forget what has paralyzed me.
                  Well, friend, do you still refuse? If you do, I have only to add that the dice
                  will relieve me of my incumbrance. I have a natural and acquired fondness for the
                  vice of play, and, from my past experience, I do not despair of being rapidly
                  relieved. Speak finally now, for myself I have nothing more to say."</p>
               <p>And the young man, as cold and gloomy as ever, ceased speaking, looking out into
                  the gloomy night.</p>
               <p>The stranger did not reply for some moments. During this pause, his penetrating
                  eyes were fixed intently upon the face of his companion, and he seemed to feel
                  that he was in presence of a man who had finally resolved, and whom it was useless
                  to make any effort to move. Then, as he gazed, a sigh shook his breast, and an
                  expression of compassion, almost tender, as a father's for an unhappy child,
                  softened the iron features, and vailed the brilliant eyes.</p>
               <p>He stretched out his hand, and laying it kindly on the young man's shoulder,
                  said,</p>
               <p>"You must suffer much."</p>
               <p>"I do," was the gloomy reply.</p>
               <p>"Is there no means of relieving this unhappiness?"</p>
               <p>"None."</p>
               <p>"You will not confide in me entirely, and take my advice."</p>
               <p>"It is useless, friend; it will only tear open my wounds."</p>
               <p>A silence followed the low words, during which neither spoke.</p>
               <p>"Be it so," said the stranger, at length; "I do not further urge you, and I accept
                  your gift."</p>
               <p>With these words, he took a piece of paper, wrote some lines on it, and received
                  in exchange for it the papers which St. John still held in his hand.</p>
               <p>"I retain what I need," said the young man, "and my future is already resolved
                  on."</p>
               <p>"That at least you can speak of."</p>
               <p>"Assuredly. I shall to-morrow apply to the Governor of Virginia for a commission
                  in the service of his Majesty."</p>
               <pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC6146-00000184"/>
               <p>"Ah! you apply to Dunmore?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. That is, to the Governor of this colony, in his official capacity; my plea
                  being simply that I am an educated Virginian."</p>
               <p>"You go West?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, to the Indian wars, and, if I do not die there, down the Ohio river to New
                  Spain, thence to Europe."</p>
               <p>And the young man looked, with the calmness of despair, through the window, at the
                  stars.</p>
               <p>The stranger sighed, and his clear eyes were again vailed with their expression of
                  compassionate regret.</p>
               <p>"I understand all now," he said, "and I can not oppose your plans. I know well
                  that the heart, when deeply wounded, instinctively recoils from the sight of those
                  objects familiar to it in the hours of happiness; I know that the impulse to go
                  away to some distant land, to new scenes and adventures, which will divert the
                  mind's eternal brooding, is unconquerable. Perhaps, after all, you have adopted
                  the best course, and in a few years you will return cured of your wounds."</p>
               <p>The young man replied by a gloomy shake of the head.</p>
               <p>"Well," said the stranger, "let us leave it to time. To return to the affairs of
                  the moment, I think you are right in going to the frontier. At last his Excellency
                  has sounded the bugle blast, and the men of Virginia are mustering to the
                  rendezvous. General Lewis, a giant among giants, the brave of braves, is in
                  Williamsburg, and in ten days the army will be on its march, his Excellency
                  following it with his select corps."</p>
               <p>The stranger spoke coolly, but a meaning glance showed that his words contained
                  more than they expressed. What he now added proved this:</p>
               <p>"This is the affair as it appears in the official proclamation," continued the
                  stranger, "and even to the eyes of many Virginians. Those who pierce beneath the
                  wrappings of events see differently, however. It is my profound conviction that
                  this man, Dunmore, is going out yonder to perfect the treachery which he long
                  since conceived. Conolly laid the train—his master will apply the match. You are
                  going to look on, and hear the explosion. It is really the cause of liberty which
                  you serve, in diverting thus your own private grief. Let that cheer you."</p>
               <p>And the stranger again looked earnestly and compassionately at St. John, and was
                  silent.</p>
               <p>The young man rose.</p>
               <p>"Friend," he said, "I have listened as you have listened to me, and I thank you.
                  You more than ever confirm me in my intention, and I shall early in the morning
                  proceed to put it into execution—take the first step. Yes, from this time forth I
                  am a wanderer, and if that wandering will benefit a cause which I feel is just and
                  noble, so much the better. I shall apply for the commission of lieutenant—if it is
                  refused, I shall volunteer in the ranks. Now I will go, having too far trespassed
                  already on your valuable time. You are courteous to shake your head, but I have
                  seriously interrupted you. Well, good friend, let us now part. I shall see you
                  again before I go—until then, farewell."</p>
               <p>And exchanging a grasp of the hand with his companion, who still looked at him
                  with that compassionate softness, dimming the brilliant and penetrating eyes, the
                  young man took his departure, and soon regained the street, which was still and
                  vacant.</p>
               <p>With measured steps, and in silence, he sought his own mansion, and the lonely
                  stars looked down upon him, peering with their curious eyes, as they have looked
                  on men who have suffered in all ages.</p>
               <p>As he entered the door, the young man turned his head and saw the light still
                  shining from the lofty eyrie of the stranger.</p>
               <p>"Yes," he murmured, "like him, it keeps watch while others sleep. Sleep! Oh! when
                  shall I sleep, and not awake?"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER LXVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">A VIRGINIA GIANT.</head>
               <p>ON the next day Mr. St. John presented himself, clad with the most scrupulous
                  ceremony, at the door of Governor Dunmore's palace.</p>
               <p>He was shown into the receiving room by a solemn major domo in black velvet, and
                  thus found himself in the presence of the Governor.</p>
               <p>Lord Dunmore was seated, as always, in his great carved chair covered with red
                  damask, the portraits of the king and queen, respectively, facing and behind him,
                  and at a table, the members of the council, together with Captain Foy, were ranged
                  in a long and imposing array.</p>
               <p>There was another personage seated at some distance, whom Mr. St. John had never
                  before seen, and this man attracted perforce, as it were, his attention.</p>
               <p>He was almost gigantic in stature, with limbs moulded like those of a Hercules,
                  and his massive head, with its long hair, rose from a pair of shoulders, which,
                  like those of Atlas, seemed vigorous enough to bear aloft a world. The broad
                  collar was turned down, and the throat of this singular personage was thus
                  revealed—a mass of iron muscles, and sinews like whip cords. He was clad in a pair
                  of huge horseman's boots, to which were affixed heavy spurs with enormous rowels;
                  knee breeches of buckskin, secured at the knee by thongs instead of buckles, and
                  over this lower costume fell the folds of a hunting shirt, gathered round the
                  waist by a broad leather belt, from which depended an enormous broad-sword.</p>
               <p>The air of this man had in it a collected and invincible resolution, mingled with
                  a sort of wild and primitive ease; but it was the ease of a stern and rugged
                  nature, which does not care for the etiquette of courts. As though to confirm this
                  impression, the strange-looking personage held in his hand, as if from habit, a
                  short Indian pipe, which he passed backwards and forwards through his fingers, as
                  he gazed with a careless air at the Governor.</p>
               <p>St. John exchanged a glance with the individual as he entered, and remembered
                  afterwards the penetrating eyes which flashed beneath the shaggy brows.</p>
               <p>"Well, sir," said the Governor, without returning the young man's bow in the
                  least, "pray what is your pleasure?"</p>
               <p>"I have indicated it in the paper which lies before your Excellency," returned St.
                  John, coldly, pointing to the table, and again bowing.</p>
               <p>Lord Dunmore raised the paper with a supercilious air and looked at it carelessly.
                  Then he looked again at the young man, and tried, after the fashion usual with his
                  lordship, to brow-beat him.</p>
               <p>As may be imagined, it had little effect. The cruel distress of the young man's
                  mind was a triple shield against any thing which the words or looks of the
                  Governor could express.</p>
               <p>He felt rather wearied standing, while being subjected to this scrutiny—that was
                  all—and looked round for a chair. There was none vacant, and although a handbell
                  upon the table at his Excellency's elbow would have summoned a servant in a
                  moment, it remained untouched.</p>
               <p>"So this is from yourself, is it, sir?" said his lordship, tapping the paper with
                  his finger and then throwing it down.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my lord, as you may perceive, it bears my signature."</p>
               <p>"The signature of 'H. St. John,' I believe," said the Governor, coldly.</p>
               <p>"That is my name, your lordship."</p>
               <p>"The name of one who grossly insulted me, sir!" said his Excellency, frowning,
                  "and you now expect me to forgive and forget that, and commission you anew, after
                  your insulting treatment of my last."</p>
               <pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC6146-00000186"/>
               <p>Mr. St. John replied, with his old gloomy calmness, "Precisely, my lord."</p>
               <p>Lord Dunmore looked for a moment at the young man with silent anger, and then
                  moving about in his chair, as was his habit when growing more and more angry, said
                  rudely,</p>
               <p>"And upon what grounds do you presume, sir, to make this request?"</p>
               <p>"Will I be permitted to inform your Excellency?" said St. John.</p>
               <p>"What do you mean, sir? Have I not demanded the information."</p>
               <p>"It is true that your Excellency has done so, and I only request permission to
                  speak, uninterrupted."</p>
               <p>The flush on Lord Dunmore's brow grew deeper, and the vein in his forehead
                  swelled.</p>
               <p>"Mr. St. John," he said, with a scowl, "you seem to think it necessary to bandy
                  reproaches with me whenever you appear before me. On former occasions I have
                  overlooked this, but I advise you, for your own good, not to repeat them."</p>
               <p>"I do not wish to do so, my lord. I wish, on the present occasion, simply to say,
                  with the highest respect for the authority of your lordship, that I am
                  constitutionally subject to irritation when not permitted to speak in my own way,
                  and for this reason I solicit permission from your lordship to speak without
                  interruption."</p>
               <p>"Speak, then, sir!" said Lord Dunmore, more angry than ever, but beaten by his
                  adversary's superior coolness; "speak, and as briefly as possible."</p>
               <p>"I will, my lord. Your lordship asked me the grounds upon which I apply for this
                  commission—"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, I did."</p>
               <p>"Well I reply to your lordship as briefly as possible, as you request. I resigned
                  my former commission because the duties which it involved were unpleasant to me.
                  In Virginia we are so accustomed to be served, that we can not ourselves serve, as
                  gentlemen do, I am told, in the old world. The duties of my office of lieutenant,
                  in a word, were distasteful to me, and I resigned my commission. I see that your
                  lordship is thinking of the scene on that occasion. It was unfortunate. I beg that
                  your lordship will make allowance for a somewhat excitable temperament. After that
                  scene I should certainly not apply for a new commission in my own name, as it
                  were, to the nobleman with whom I had had an altercation. It is simply as an
                  educated Virginian who can furnish testimonials of fitness, that I apply to the
                  Governor of the colony of Virginia for a commission to fight the battles of
                  Virginia. I have endeavored to be as brief as possible in laying before your
                  lordship the state of the case, and need only add that I do not ask a favor. It is
                  simply permission to join the forces of the colony which I ask—a commission in the
                  service of his Majesty."</p>
               <p>And Mr. St. John bowed, and was silent.</p>
               <p>"Have you done, sir?" said his Excellency, suppressing his anger, and speaking in
                  a tone of striking coldness and spitefulness, if we may use the word.</p>
               <p>"I have said all, my lord."</p>
               <p>"And you wish a reply?"</p>
               <p>"As soon as is convenient to your lordship."</p>
               <p>"It is quite convenient now," said the Governor, with a sneer; "I require no
                  delay, sir, in deciding whether I will commission a person of your description in
                  his Majesty's service. No, sir! I regard your conduct and your character as
                  seditious, and you may congratulate yourself upon personal immunity after your
                  deportment here upon a former occasion. I refuse you the commission, sir! I need
                  no time to reflect! I treat your special pleading about 'educated Virginians' and
                  'Governors of this colony' with the contempt which it deserves! I have still
                  another word to add, sir! Beware how you again cross this threshold with your
                  arrogant air, and your insults! Hitherto I have spared you—for the future, beware!
                  Now, go sir! I have done with you!"</p>
               <pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC6146-00000187"/>
               <p>A flash of his old passion for an instant illuminated, like lurid lightning, the
                  young man's haughty eyes, but this soon disappeared. His face again became pale
                  and cold—his eyes colder still.</p>
               <p>"I am glad to reciprocate your Excellency's desire, that in future we go separate
                  ways," he said with courtly calmness; "I did not seek your Excellency formerly,
                  you sought me; and now I depart, careless of your Excellency's hatred or
                  regard."</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John accompanied these words with a low bow, and went out of the apartment
                  and the palace.</p>
               <p>On the same afternoon he was going along Gloucester street, in front of the
                  Raleigh tavern, when he heard a grave, deep voice utter the words:</p>
               <p>"Give you good day, Mr. St. John."</p>
               <p>The young man raised his head, and saw, standing upon the portico of the tavern,
                  the tall personage whom he had seen in the receiving room of Lord Dunmore. At the
                  other end of the porch, a number of men, who seemed to be recruits, were
                  assembled, engaged in laughing, talking and drinking. Their suddenly-assumed
                  military air, added to the tarnished uniforms worn by some of the company,
                  communicated to the Raleigh the air of a camp.</p>
               <p>As to the tall personage who thus saluted Mr. St. John, he was clad, as before, in
                  his rude costume of the backwoods, and carried in his hand the short pipe, which
                  now, however, was smoking.</p>
               <p>As he stood erect, apart from the rest, his stature appeared more gigantic than
                  before; and the young man saw that his vigorous frame was moulded with
                  extraordinary symmetry.</p>
               <p>"Give you good day, Mr. St. John," repeated the stranger, in his deep voice. "Do
                  you still hold to your determination, expressed this morning to his lordship, of
                  going to the frontier?"</p>
               <p>"I do, sir," said St. John, inclining his head. "It is my purpose to volunteer in
                  the ranks."</p>
               <p>"In the ranks?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"As a common soldier?"</p>
               <p>"Precisely, sir."</p>
               <p>"That shall not be necessary, sir," said the stranger, in the same deep, reserved
                  voice; "I will commission you."</p>
               <p>"You?" said the young man, in some astonishment.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said his companion, calmly. "A man of your coolness, and so disposed
                  to serve the country, shall not fight in the ranks, though many gentlemen will.
                  You deserve a commission, sir, and I make you Lieutenant in Colonel Fleming's
                  battalion. My name is Lewis—Andrew Lewis, of Botetourt, and I listened, with
                  pleasure, to your observations this morning."</p>
               <p>St. John bowed to the man of whom he had so often heard—the commissioner for
                  Virginia in the treaty of Fort Stanwix—of whom the Governor of New York declared
                  that "the earth seemed to tremble under him as he walked along."</p>
               <p>"I am a rough backwoodsman," said General Lewis, "and make few protestations, sir.
                  I nevertheless say that I like your face. I 'll commission you without further
                  acquaintance. If his lordship objects, it will not move me. If he does not like
                  me, let him seek another commander for the forces. You will rendezvous at Camp
                  Union, otherwise, Fort Savannah, on the first of next month, which is near at
                  hand," and General Lewis calmly inserted his pipe between his lips, and commenced
                     smoking.<ref rend="super" target="#note_038" xml:id="return_038">*</ref> After
                  some more arrangements, Mr. St. John took his leave, and went to his lodgings.</p>

               <p>"Well," he murmured, as he stretched himself upon the sofa, "that is the first
                  step toward the struggle and oblivion. If a tomahawk or a bullet interpose, what
                  matter? 'T is the same, for the end will be reached."</p>
               <p>As he spoke, Tom Alston entered, and his friend laid before him all his plans,
                  which he had hitherto concealed.</p>
               <pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC6146-00000188"/>
               <p>To paint the dismay and sorrow of honest Tom Alston at this mad resolution, as he
                  called it, would be impossible. He exhausted his strength, and grew positively
                  hoarse in the attempt to change the resolution of his friend.</p>
               <p>In vain did he protest, however. In vain he declared that the state of things, in
                  regard to Bonnybel, could not last—that every one at Vanely had as perfect an
                  affection for him as at any previous time. In vain did he represent that the
                  mystery of the young girl's demeanor could not long remain unsolved, and that a
                  single word would show the injustice she had been guilty of—the groundless nature
                  of her sudden dismissal of her lover.</p>
               <p>To all this, the young man opposed either gloomy silence only, or the words,
                  incessantly repeated, "I am ruined, I have lost all."</p>
               <p>Tom Alston returned again to his expostulations, and used every possible argument
                  to prove the madness of his friend's course. The family at Vanely had felt the
                  greatest solicitude about his illness; had only been prevented from seeing him by
                  the physician's orders; they had sent all the delicacies which were so grateful to
                  him in his convalescence; the girls had even come to Williamsburg, and had stolen
                  into his chamber, in his sleep. At this, the young man started; and, all at once,
                  the vision, as he had considered it, flashed on his mind, and a look of wonder
                  greeted the announcement of the reality of the appearance. But he was no more
                  convinced than before. "I am ruined, I have lost all," was all that his friend
                  could extract from him; and, after three hours of expostulation, honest Tom Alston
                  sank back, pale and exhausted, and gave up the struggle.</p>
               <p>Two days afterward, Mr. St. John and his friend exchanged a silent grasp of the
                  hand. The young man mounted his horse, and, throwing a last look upon the window
                  through which she had shone on him, like a vision of the night, in the luminous
                  halo, he set forward.</p>
               <p>As before, Tallyho tossed his head, and careered merrily along; but his head was
                  not turned toward home.</p>
               <p>Camp Union, or, as we now say, Lewisburg, was the young man's destination; and,
                  going along, not smiling, as before, but gloomy and despairing, he murmured:</p>
               <p>"A tomahawk or bullet—'t is the same!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER LXIX.</head>
               <head type="sub">ON THE BANKS OF BELLE RIVIERE.</head>
               <p>THE aim of this book is rather to show what led to our Revolution, than to narrate
                  great public events; rather to present something like a picture, however feeble
                  and faint, of the state of society which preceded the struggle, than to follow
                  that struggle through its bloody, but triumphant steps, from Bunker Hill to
                  Yorktown.</p>
               <p>The precursor of the greater contest was the war of '74, which is now known as
                  "Dunmore's war," perhaps on the principle of <foreign xml:lang="LAT">lucus a non
                     lucendo,</foreign> for he did not fight the battle which began and ended
                  it.</p>
               <p>This is not the place or the occasion to trace the details of that splendid
                  campaign, if we may call it such; that campaign in which the Indian dominion, on
                  the banks of "labelle riviere," the Ohio, was leveled at a blow, and the ferocious
                  savage driven back to his fastnesses.</p>
               <p>We listen with dull ears to the old frontier story, and can not believe that the
                  sweet and smiling fields, blooming now with the fairest flowers of peace, were
                  once the battle field on which the Anglo-Saxons opposed a merciless enemy. In our
                  comfortable homes to-day, we read carelessly the old chronicle which clasps in its
                  embrace such bleeding forms and desolated hearth-stones. It is in the midst of
                  peace and plenty, with the blessings of a ripe civilization around us, with the
                  bright eyes and cheeks, and the laughter of happy children at our side, that we
                  read the moving story. What does it say? Let an incident, similar to a thousand
                     others,<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC6146-00000189"/> and no worse, tell what
                  horrors were then enacted on the border.</p>
               <p>"An Indian seized Mrs. Scott, and ordered her to a particular spot, and not to
                  move; others stabbed and cut the throats of the three younger children, in their
                  bed, and afterwards lifting them up, dashed them upon the floor, near the mother;
                  the eldest, a beautiful girl of eight years old, awoke, escaped out of the bed,
                  ran to her parent, and, with the most plaintive accents, cried, 'O! mamma! mamma!
                  save me!' The mother, in the deepest anguish of spirit, and with a flood of tears,
                  entreated the savages to spare her child, but, with a brutal fierceness, they
                  tomahawked and stabbed her in her mother's arms."</p>
               <p>In the pages of Withers and Kercheval, the Commines and the Froissart of the
                  Valley, we read all this, and follow the details of a hundred massacres—the
                  burning of houses, the murder of men, the merciless beating out of women and
                  children's brains against the door posts of the dwellings of the West. We read it
                  all, and then close the chronicle, and go to the routine of business, and scarcely
                  give a thought to the men who prostrated the power of the savage, thus dyeing the
                  very soil with the best blood of our country.</p>
               <p>It is matter of rejoicing to all who admire and love the great hearts of the past,
                  that Virginia has finally decreed recognition of the claims of one at least of
                  these heroes of the border.</p>
               <p>The names of Andrew Lewis and his noble companions shine like stars in the western
                  horizon. Let the valiant soldier stand on his well-won pedestal in the capital of
                  the land which he fought for; let the children of to-day and the future be told,
                  that long ago, when the sky was dark, in old years which they do not remember,
                  this stalwart gentleman and his brave followers opposed their broad breasts to the
                  flood of savage cruelty, and stood up between the tomahawk and the bosoms from
                  which the present generation drew their life. Let them be told that when women and
                  children were cowering before a foe which knew no mercy, this man and his
                  companions came to succor them; let the names of those who came from the bloody
                  fight be honored; let the memory of those who fell be perennial in the nation's
                  heart, and all coming generations delight to honor them.</p>
               <p>At some other time we may relate the "old and moving story;" how, entering the
                  wilderness at the head of his noble army, General Lewis reached the junction of
                  the Kanawha and Ohio, in October, and how there, at Point Pleasant, on the banks
                  of that stream which was called "belle riviere" for its beauty, he defeated the
                  combined forces of the great northern nations.</p>
               <p>It was the flower of the Indian tribes, led on by their most celebrated chiefs,
                  which were thus routed. Redhawk, the renowned Delaware, Cornstalk, the greatest of
                  the Shawnees, and Ellinipsico, the "Mountain Deer," his son; Scoppathus, the
                  Mingo; Chiyawee, the Wyandot, and Logan, the last of the Cayugas, whose mournful
                  speech, in reply to Dunmore, is the pearl of Indian eloquence.</p>
               <p>At sunset on the 10th day of October, the Indian power was completely broken, and
                  the tribes were flying into the forest.</p>
               <p>The Virginians returned to count their dead.</p>
               <p>Alas! among those dead ones was Charles Lewis, the brother of the general, one of
                  the colonels of the expedition, and beloved by all for his courage and
                  nobility.</p>
               <p>Receiving in his heart the fatal ball, which he had come from such a distance to
                  oppose his bresst to, he fell at the foot of a tree, only murmured a few words,
                  and expired as the soldiers came back from the pursuit, amid the tears of his
                  companions, and his brother.<ref rend="super" target="#note_039"

               <p>It was not only this valiant gentleman who fell, who there, on the banks of the
                  great stream, breathed his last, stiffening in the arms of those faithful
                  comrades, who wept for him and held him on their bosoms. The bloody foliage of
                  October was dyed with a deeper crimson, and the waves of "la belle riviere" were
                  stained with the life current of the<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC6146-00000190"/>
                  noblest hearts of the land. The bright waves rolled on, the brilliant sun of
                  October shone on forest and river, the stains disappeared, and the birds chirped
                  and sang where the volleys of musketry and the clash of arms had startled the
                  silence of the woods. But that blood was not lost in the immensity of waters—that
                  crimson stain did not idly imbrue the soil of the West. It fertilized and
                  enriched, not the spot where it fell only, but the whole land, east and west.
                  Borne along through the length of the land to the dark waves of the Gulf, it
                  diffused its influence wherever it flowed; though invisible, and swallowed in the
                  waste of waters, it blazed with red fires before the eyes of the country. From the
                  earth which drank it sprang the bright flowers of peace, and the golden fruits of
                  civilization. Not in vain thus did they bleed, those noble hearts of the old
                  border, those heroes of western and eastern Virginia. To him who writes, all their
                  names are sacred. The sun which shone down on their lifeless bodies, shines more
                  brightly now because they fell. They rolled back the cloud from our horizon, and
                  in that horizon, now calm and beautiful, let them shine as the stars for ever!</p>
               <p>General Lewis would have completed the extermination of the enemy on the border,
                  and driven them into the wilderness never to return; but here he was opposed by
                  his Excellency, Lord Dunmore.</p>
               <p>In courts of law, men are condemned upon circumstantial evidence, and hanged for
                  the crimes thus proven on them. Why should the judge of historical events and
                  characters be confined within narrower bounds? The circumstantial evidence which
                  connects Lord Dunmore's name with treachery, and the most horrible schemes
                  excludes every other hypothesis than guilt, and has long since gibbeted that
                  nobleman in the popular mind. Some day, that treachery will be established by
                  irrefutable documentary proof.</p>
               <p>We do not follow in detail the events succeeding the battle of Point Pleasant, to
                  show, as we think we have it in our power, that the Governor had been guilty of
                  "foul play." It is no part of our undertaking to bring home to him a particular
                  treason. It is enough to say that General Lewis was sent by an order from Lord
                  Dunmore, who was on the Sciota, to disband his forces and return.</p>
               <p>The General could scarcely believe his senses; and for reply, indignantly refused.
                  He resolutely continued his march, and finally halted within three miles of the
                  Governor's camp.</p>
               <p>Lord Dunmore was at the head of his own army, and yet had failed to come to
                  Lewis's assistance at Point Pleasant. The General's men were very much inflamed
                  against his Excellency, as the event which followed demonstrated. Most truly did
                  an eye-witness of these events say of Dunmore and Conolly, "there were wheels
                  within wheels, dark things behind the curtain between this noble earl and his
                  sub-satellite."</p>
               <p>That the Virginians under General Lewis believed as much, is very plain.</p>
               <p>"His lordship," says the historian, "accompanied by the Indian chief, White-Eyes,
                  now visited the camp of Lewis, and he (according to some relations) with
                  difficulty restrained his men from killing the Governor and his Indian
                  companion."</p>
               <p>But we trench upon history, and only add here, that the General was forced to
                  obey. With a heavy heart, and surrounded by men who thirsted to revenge the
                  horrible cruelties of the Indians on a thousand occasions, General Lewis bowed to
                  the command of his superior and marched back: Lord Dunmore remained to perfect his
                  schemes.</p>
               <p>He returned in November to Williamsburg.</p>
               <p>Thus ended the war of '74.</p>
               <p>It had demonstrated to the minds of all men three important things.</p>
               <p>That the men of Virginia were ready for the field in a moment, and too stubborn to
                  yield.</p>
               <p>That the struggle of the Revolution would not be embarrassed by incursions on the
                  frontier.</p>
               <pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC6146-00000191"/>
               <p>That Lord Dunmore was a traitor to the colony.</p>
               <p>This was what "Dunmore's war" impressed upon the most careless and unthinking.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE OLD CHURCH OF ST. JOHN.</head>
               <p>IT was the great and peculiar good fortune of Virginia to have thus, for the last
                  of her governors, when the storm was first lowering on the horizon, a man whose
                  whole conduct revolted completely the popular mind—whose malignant and treacherous
                  disposition and action united all the elements of revolution.</p>
               <p>Had Fauquier or Botetourt held the reins, they would, either of them, been the
                  last whom the Virginians would have struck at.</p>
               <p>Lord Dunmore was now their first enemy—their prime hatred.</p>
               <p>With the spring of '75, all the fruits of the long opposition rapidly matured. In
                  the electric atmosphere, as in a hot-house, the bloody flower of revolution began
                  rapidly to expand into bloom; and its seeds were soon scattered far and near,
                  wafted on the sobbing wind which heralded the approaching hurricane.</p>
               <p>The general congress at Philadelphia had risen in October of the preceding
                  year—almost at the moment when Dunmore was endeavoring to perfect his treachery on
                  the Sciota.</p>
               <p>They had agreed on a petition to the king—an address to the people of Great
                  Britain—and a memorial to the inhabitants of the colonies.</p>
               <p>But the great result of this congress was the bond which thenceforth united the
                  North and the South. The leaders of the two sections saw that they could now
                  advance with the certainty of coöperation.</p>
               <p>The delegates of Virginia returned home, followed by Dunmore from the frontier;
                  and then they gave,<foreign xml:lang="LAT">viva voce,</foreign> an account of all
                  things to the people.</p>
               <p>Around one of these delegates, at the court house of his county, the old neighbors
                  gathered and made him describe the whole proceeding. Then they asked about the men
                  who formed the congress.</p>
               <p>Patrick Henry replied, "Colonel Washington was unquestionbly the greatest man on
                  that floor."</p>
               <p>The spring of '75 opened thus, as we have said, with a threatening cloud, and that
                  murmur which precedes the rising of the masses, as it is the precursor of the
                  storm.</p>
               <p>In March, the second Virginia convention met at the old church of St. John in
                  Richmond town, crowning to-day, as it then did, the summit of the hill, from which
                  the eye embraces the city below, the foaming falls, the glittering current of the
                  river, and the beautiful expanse of field and forest.</p>
               <p>Up even to this moment, the best patriots cast a longing look behind them at the
                  peaceful fields of the past, and tried to close their eyes to the events rushing
                  forward to fulfillment. They wished to avoid that terrible conflict which would
                  stain the earth with so much precious blood. They hesitated and doubted—resolving,
                  indeed, that the general congress had done well—that the warmest thanks of
                  Virginia were justly due to her delegates for their services—but also resolving
                  that the greatest desire, the most ardent aspiration of all men should be, for the
                  "speedy return of those haloyon days" when England had not yet molested them.</p>
               <p>Patrick Henry listened in silence to these resolutions, bearing the stamp of the
                  doubt and indecision of every one. He said nothing—waiting for the proper moment.
                  When that time had come, he rose and moved that "a well-regulated militia,
                  composed of gentlemen and yeomen, was the natural strength and only security of a
                  free government." That "the establishment of such militia was at<pb n="382-383"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000192"/> that time peculiarly necessary." And that "the
                  colony be immediately put in a state of defense."</p>
               <p>The resolutions fell like a thunderbolt. After the first silence of astonishment,
                  a dozen members of the convention sprung to their feet and vehemently opposed
                  them. The burden of the flood of impassioned oratory was that the resolutions were
                  premature and impolitic—that the time had not come, if it ever was to come.</p>
               <p>It was then that the great prophet of revolution, rising slowly and solemnly from
                  his seat, delivered that speech which is a part of the classics of America.</p>
               <p>In its burning sentences, as we read it even to-day, the stormy voice of the
                  orator again resounds; its solemn and august periods seem to blaze and flash with
                  the hidden fires of an immense genius, a gigantic resolution. It strips the husk
                  from events, and defines with a finger of iron the exact issue. The invisible
                  spirit of the Revolution informs it; like an avalanche it rolls onward, sweeping
                  away all obstacles to the comprehension of the issue, and roaring like the ocean
                  in its passage.</p>
               <p>With the measured step of a giant, moving slowly, the orator advanced at last to
                  the dividing line—the gulf between submission and revolution:</p>
               <p>"If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retreat from the
                  contest! There is no retreat but in submission and slavery! Our chains are forged!
                  Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable! and
                  let it come!"</p>
               <p>Then with both arms extended aloft, and burning eyes, "I know not," he said, "what
                  course others may take; but as for me—give me liberty or give me death!"</p>
               <p>The resolutions were adopted without a dissenting voice, their policy embraced,
                  and the convention rose.</p>
               <p>Its action sent a thrill of satisfaction through the whole of Virginia, and in
                  three weeks the popular mind was braced for the contest.</p>
               <p>Everywhere old arms were hunted up, swords burnished, the militia was organized,
                  and only a match to fire the train was required.</p>
               <p>Lord Dunmore applied this match on the 20th of April, by removing the powder from
                  the old magazine in Williamsburg.</p>
               <p>But let us not anticipate.</p>

               <head type="sub">BONNYBEL'S DREAM.</head>
               <p>AT Vanely all is bright and beautiful again, as on that morning when St. John and
                  Tom Alston cantered to the door, together, on the day succeeding Lady Dunmore's
                  entry.</p>
               <p>The fine season of May has nearly come, and the swallows twitter, as before; the
                  grass is full of flowers; the great oaks clothe themselves in heavy foliage,
                  through which the breezes of the spring pass, as it were, with laughter. In the
                  beautiful sunsets and the golden dawns, the fine old mansion raises proudly its
                  gray walls, and looks down, smiling, on the fields and river, as before.</p>
               <p>Let us follow one of the curious and prying rays of sunrise into a chamber of the
                  mansion. The indiscreet and careless intruder, as though weary with his long
                  journey of so many millions of miles, falls prostrate, and rests tranquilly upon
                  the soft hair of Bonnybel, who sleeps beside her sister.</p>
               <p>The sisters always occupy one apartment and one bed. It was always so in their
                  childhood; they retain the habit.</p>
               <p>Helen is awake, but lies, as it were, in that delightful state of
                  semi-consciousness which is such a luxury to the dreamer. The young lady dreams,
                  so to speak, though she does not sleep. From this reverie she is aroused by what
                  seems a sob at her side.</p>
               <pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC6146-00000193"/>
               <p>She turns her head quickly, and looks at her sister.</p>
               <p>Bonnybel lies with one round bare arm thrown outside the counterpane; the other is
                  placed beneath her head. Over the white arm fall the curls of her soft brown hair,
                  like a golden ripple; for the vagrant sunbeams change their hue, and make them
                  shine.</p>
               <p>The light falls on the beautiful brow, like a glory, in the pictures of Raphael
                  and his brethren. It never fell on a purer and sweeter face; and, lying thus
                  enveloped in her snowy night dress, close buttoned to the neck, the girl is a
                  picture of modesty and loveliness.</p>
               <p>But her sleep is not tranquil. Some sorrowful dream seems to prey upon her. Her
                  form trembles slightly, and beneath the long silken lashes, resting on her cheeks,
                  large tears flow silently. Helen gazes at her. The form of the girl again shakes,
                  and another sob escapes from the half-parted lips, dying away, like a murmur, in
                  the silent chamber.</p>
               <p>Helen gazes at her sister with an air of the greatest solicitude and tenderness,
                  for this somewhat stately and reserved girl conceals under her prim exterior a
                  warm and affectionate heart.</p>
               <p>All at once, the sleeping girl moves painfully, and, with a contraction of the
                  lips which indicates great suffering, murmurs, audibly,</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! no! Do not take away the letter! do not take away the letter! Oh, me! oh,
                  me!" and a passionate sob breaks from the girl's lips, followed by a flood of
                  tears, which bathe her cheeks and neck.</p>
               <p>"Wake, sister!" cried Helen, laying her hand on the girl's shoulder. "What are you
                  dreaming of? Wake up!"</p>
               <p>Bonnybel opened her eyes, and looked dreamily around her.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, sister?" said Helen. "You were crying and sobbing in your
                  sleep. Were you dreaming?"</p>
               <p>The girl passed her hands over her eyes, and sighed deeply.</p>
               <p>"Yes," she murmured; "I believe I was. Oh, sister! I have had such a terrible
                  dream!" and Bonnybel wiped her wet eyes, and half rose in bed, leaning upon her
                  elbow, and looking around her.</p>
               <p>"What was the dream?" asked Helen. "It must have been very sorrowful."</p>
               <p>"It was, sister. Oh, so sorrowful! I thought <emph>he</emph> was dying in the
                  battle with the Indians. A bullet had wounded him, and they were holding him upon
                  their breasts at the foot of a tree by the great river. He was pale and bleeding!
                  oh, sister! so pale! and his breast was all bloody!"</p>
               <p>Bonnybel sobbed again, as she spoke, and wiped her eyes with her fingers.</p>
               <p>"They opened his coat, and were going to take away a letter—a letter I wrote him
                  long ago, which saved his life once! Oh, sister! how foolish I was to think that
                  he has that letter now!" and leaning her head upon the fringed pillow again, the
                  girl cried silently.</p>
               <p>"Do n't cry, dear," said Helen, kissing her. "You must not let this foolish dream
                  disturb you. There is no reason to think he is even wounded."</p>
               <p>"No," murmured the girl, more calmly; "and you know I am nothing to him. But the
                  scene was so vivid that I thought it real. I saw every thing as plainly as I see
                  the mirror there. He was lying on the grass at the foot of a tall elm on the banks
                  of a river which flowed, at a little distance, in the sunshine. The sunshine came
                  through the boughs of the elm, and fell upon his forehead, which was very pale. A
                  man, who had leaned his rifle against the tree, was holding <emph>his</emph> head
                  upon his breast, and opening his bosom where he was wounded. The linen was all
                  covered with blood, and his eyes were closed, and he breathed heavily. Oh, me!
                  what made me dream so? I could have died when I saw him! I thought they tried to
                  take away a letter from his bosom—one of my letters—and he did not seem to know
                  it. He was looking at a flower which grew<pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC6146-00000194"
                  /> at his feet, a white rose, and he smiled as he used to smile once when—oh, me!
                  I am so miserable!"</p>
               <p>And with a passionate sob, which seemed slowly to have gathered in her breast, as
                  she had gone on, the girl was silent, her bosom shaken with sighs, her cheeks wet
                  with large tears chasing each other in rapid succession.</p>
               <p>Helen put an arm round her neck, and drew toward her the trembling form, with a
                  tenderness which betrayed itself in her own moist eyes and sad lips. Then resting
                  the girl's head upon her shoulder, as she would have done a child's, she pressed
                  her lips to the white cheek, and smoothed the disordered mass of curls from the
                  brows which they covered.</p>
               <p>"Do n't cry, dear," she said, soothingly; "you must not let a dream affect you so.
                  'Tis only a dream, and you should not permit it to cause you so much trouble. You
                  were probably thinking of the battle when you went to sleep, and your imagination
                  thus carried you away."</p>
               <p>"It was so real!" murmured the girl, hiding her face on her sister's shoulder,
                  with a sob.</p>
               <p>"But it was only a dream," continued Helen. "Dreams are merely the result of the
                  fancy let loose, and you know the old saying, that they always 'go by contraries.'
                  If there is any thing in your dream, it proves that he is alive and well."</p>
               <p>Bonnybel only sobbed, making no reply.</p>
               <p>Helen continued to soothe and talk to the girl, and at last the tears disappeared
                  from the pure eyes, and a sad smile lit up the innocent features.</p>
               <p>"Well, sister," said Bonnybel, at last, "you have made me feel much better, and I
                  will not permit this dream to disturb me so. After all he is—he is—nothing—to me.
                  Well! I will not cry. I hope he is happy, and 's forgotten me."</p>
               <p>A last tear moistened the girl's eyes, and she was silent, motionless, in the arms
                  of her sister, leaning her blushing face, enveloped by the soft masses of brown
                  hair, on the shoulder of Helen.</p>
               <p>An hour afterwards, before the family had risen, Bonnybel was going, through the
                  fresh light of morning, on her daily expedition to the "quarters," followed by her
                  maid, bearing the accustomed basket.</p>
               <p>Only a sad and pensive smile remained, after her dream, and she was tranquil
                  again, for she had prayed for him.</p>

                  <p>"'T IS so long since I 've written to my Kate that she must almost have
                     forgotten me. But you will not think, my dear, that this silence has proceeded
                     from forgetfulness; that is not possible toward the dearest girl in the
                     world.</p>
                  <p>"I have been unhappy, and when I 'm unhappy I can not write. Alas! my Kate, I
                     am greatly changed. I am no more merry and happy, as I used to be. Once I
                     thought this life was the gayest and happiest existence imaginable; I laughed
                     and jested, and bade defiance to gloom. Now, all 's gone from me. I only sigh,
                     and sometimes I go away and cry for hours. You know the cause of this
                     change.</p>
                  <p>"I write now to tell you that <emph>I've seen him again,</emph> and oh! he was
                     so changed. I shall proceed to tell you how the interview took place. In
                     pouring my pain and sorrow into my own Kate's ears, I may relieve my bosom, in
                     some degree, of the cruel pressure I experience.</p>
                  <p>"'T was this morning, at the 'quarters,' in Mammy Liza's cabin. I woke at
                     sunrise, crying from a bad dream I had, in which I saw him wounded and dying in
                     a great battle with the Indians. My dream was so vivid that when sister shook
                     and awoke me, I was sobbing and crying, and for a long time I could not get
                     over the impression.</p>
                  <pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC6146-00000195"/>
                  <p>"I rose and dressed, however, and went on my customary rounds to see the sick,
                     returning, as my habit is, by Mammy Liza's house.</p>
                  <p>"I had been thinking of my dream and of <emph>him,</emph> and approached the
                     cabin with my head bent down, gazing absently at a small white flower I held in
                     my hand—a little rose, such as I 'd given him one day, when we went together to
                     Jamestown island—it seems centuries now! and I scarce realize the truth that I
                     am the Bonnybel of that time. But I shall not stop to speak of that. I was very
                     near the door of Mammy Liza's house, and was thinking of him, as I do now and
                     then, when I heard the neigh of a horse. I thought that there was something
                     familiar and yet strange in the sound, and looked toward the spot from which it
                     issued.</p>
                  <p>"I recognized Tallyho, his horse, in an instant; and, when I turned my head
                     toward the cabin, <emph>he</emph> stood before me. Oh, me! he was so thin and
                     pale. Oh, Kate! you can not conceive what a change had taken place in his
                     appearance. Formerly, he had been so strong and handsome; his cheeks so ruddy,
                     and his lips and eyes so laughing and full of joyous pride when he raised his
                     noble head and looked at you with that beautiful smile of such extraordinary
                     sweetness. My heart bleeds as I describe the change; now the color had all
                     disappeared from his face; his eyes were dim and sunken, as after illness; his
                     cheeks white and thin, and the hand which he leaned on Mammy Liza's
                     spinning-wheel was like a ghost's! His dress looked travel-worn, and his left
                     arm was supported by a scarf, of some Indian fabric, passed around his neck. He
                     was but the shadow of himself, and when he looked at me with a slight tinge of
                     color in his cheek and a sad surprise, inexpressibly sorrowful, I would have
                     burst into tears, and cried myself weak, had not I placed a violent constraint
                     upon myself. As I found afterward, he had been talking with Mammy Liza for
                     nearly two hours, and thus he must have ridden to Vanely in the night. Mammy
                     Liza was crying and fixing her spindle, stopping every moment to wipe her old
                     eyes, and muttering, 'My child! my own child!' in such an affecting way that I
                     could scarcely restrain my sobs. I give way to them now as I write. These blots
                     upon the paper are tears.</p>
                  <p>"He stood, for a moment, looking at me so sadly that it made my heart ache and
                     my throat feel as if it were choking. He then took from the left breast of his
                     doublet an old letter, and, with an inclination of courtesy—yes, simple
                     courtesy—held it toward me. It was the very letter I had seen the soldier try
                     to take from his breast when I saw him dying in my dream, and the wound was
                     now, apparently, in his shoulder, really, as I had dreamed it. How strange! For
                     a moment I stood looking at him with tears in my eyes, and he continued to hold
                     the letter toward me.</p>
                  <p>"I saw that he would hold it thus until I took it, and that the exertion was
                     making him weaker. I unconsciously received it, and then holding, for a moment,
                     in his own, Mammy Liza's hand, he inclined before me again with a long,
                     penetrating look, passed by me like a shadow, and thus, with his pale face
                     turned over his shoulder, as it were, he mounted his horse, and was lost in the
                     woods. He had never spoken—I had not heard his voice!</p>
                  <p>"I can write but little more, Kate; I feel faint and badly. This interview has,
                     since the morning, preyed upon my spirits; and I have vainly sought to relieve
                     my distress by writing to you. It seems only to have opened the wound afresh. I
                     remained with Mammy Liza until a message came that breakfast was ready, but I
                     could not extract from her any thing, scarcely. She only wrung her hands, and
                     muttered, 'My child! my own child!' in a manner that nearly broke my heart; and
                     I finally came away, and have come here to my chamber now to hide my red
                     eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Can you explain the strange fact of my dream? He was clad just as I saw him,
                     and, lying before me, is the letter which I dreamed they wished to take from
                     him. As he gave it to me he looked intently at the white flower in my hand, and
                     I think, as he went away, and the letter fell at my<pb n="390-391"

                     chief wretchedness!</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Kate! if I could only lay my head upon your bosom, and cry myself to rest
                     there! This meeting has made me ill, and I feel as though I was going to
                     faint.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Was I wrong in the past?</emph> Answer me, Kate: <emph>Was I
                        wrong?</emph> Could I so command my feelings as to prevent the terrible
                     change in our relations? I ask the question with inexpressible anguish. Oh,
                     tell me, Kate! <emph>was</emph> I wrong?</p>
                  <p>"I know not, but I do know that I 'm miserable! His old affection is mine no
                     longer; he bowed with common courtesy alone. Wo is me that the day should ever
                     come!</p>
                  <p>"I can not write more. The words swim in tears, and I 'm blinded by them.

               <head type="sub">THE FRIENDS.</head>
               <p>ON the day after the meeting between the young man and Bonnybel, two men, well
                  mounted, rode slowly out of Gloucester street in a western direction.</p>
               <p>These men were Tom Alston and St. John.</p>
               <p>The purple light of evening lit up the two forms clearly, and the young lady had
                  accurately described the appearance of her former lover. Mr. St. John was but the
                  ghost of himself. Since those bright and happy days when inhaling the breath of
                  love and living a life full of splendid and joyful emotions—since those hours at
                  Vanely, which now seemed to have shone for him, in the long past years of
                  centuries that had fled, the young man appeared to have become another being—to
                  have changed the very foundations of his identity.</p>
               <p>His cheek was no longer ruddy and firm; his eyes no longer filled with mirth,
                  dancing in the joyful light of love and merriment. Pale, silent, with a tranquil
                  sadness in his face, he was, truly, but the phantom of himself.</p>
               <p>Tom Alston was the same nearly as before, though somewhat more subdued, and as the
                  two friends rode along, he gazed at Mr. St. John with an air of the deepest regret
                  and compassion.</p>
               <p>The young man had been speaking of the events which had taken place since he had
                  parted with his friend. He had told how the army of General Lewis left Lewisburg;
                  how they passed rapidly through the wilderness; how they fell upon the enemy at
                  Point Pleasant, and how that enemy was defeated and put to rout. In his
                  picturesque narrative, in his sad but vivid story, characters and events rose
                  vividly before his auditor, and thus going along quietly in the bright evening, he
                  related, incident by incident, the history of his adventures and his
                  misfortunes.</p>
               <p>"It was near the end of the battle that I received this wound," said the young
                  man, indicating his left shoulder, "and 't is not yet entirely healed. Colonel
                  Lewis, the brother of the General, and myself were fighting side by side, and I
                  think we fell at nearly the same moment. A nobler-hearted gentleman ne'er lived,
                  and the whole army wept for him, and carried him to his grave with a sad triumph
                  which I 'll never forget. But to return to myself, friend. I was fighting as I
                  said, when suddenly I felt what seemed to be a red-hot iron pierce my breast, and
                  then the wild battle, with its shouts and yells, its whistling bullets and dim
                  canopy, all disappeared. I fainted, and when I returned to my senses, I was lying
                  at the foot of a tree, supported upon the breast of a companion. They had opened
                  my bosom, and were probing the wound, and I saw the bullet when it was extracted.
                  A little white flower I remember<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC6146-00000197"/> ber
                  grew at my feet, and I gazed at it, as my head drooped forward. It seemed to me
                  familiar, and I 've since recognized—but that is nothing. It is very strange!
                  Well, well, some other time, friend, I will tell you the rest of our campaign—how
                  the General, at my request, had me borne on a litter, by his side, to the spot
                  where he halted near the camp of Dunmore. The General, after a stormy scene, was
                  obliged to retreat, and changing my former plan of going down Belle Riviere to
                  Natchez, I returned with him to Botetourt. The exertion had irritated my wound,
                  and all the winter I was confined with it, receiving from the General such
                  kindness as I never shall forget. You see this man is a nobleman of nature, a
                  great-hearted gentleman, whose name will live on the page of our Virginia story
                  when the vulgar name of Dunmore has been forgotten.</p>
               <p>"So ends my story," said the young man, calmly; "you see, Tom, I have come back to
                  the spot which I left, a poor wounded soldier, with my heart wounded worse than my
                  frame. Perhaps 't would be better for me to die here; but that, I think, won't be.
                  I tarry for a moment only on my way, to exchange a passing grasp of the hand with
                  yourself and my other friends. In a week I go on my path to the old world, there
                  to seek oblivion. From that continent I shall never return. It is not my fault. I
                  thought my life would be happy, and assuredly it opened with rare promise,
                  surrounded as I was by the old, loving faces, and especially by that which—well,
                  well! Let me not open my wound, which is healing, I think. All is ended there, and
                  I blame no one. It is over simply, and I go on my way."</p>
               <p>It was thus that the young man ended his story—smiling tranquilly and gazing upon
                  the sunset.</p>
               <p>For a time, Mr. Alston remained silent and sad, with the accents of his friend
                  still echoing in his ears. Then he raised his head, uttered a deep sigh, and
                  said,</p>
               <p>"Harry, I think I am growing old."</p>
               <p>"How is that?" said St. John; "you are young both in years and character."</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston shook his head.</p>
               <p>"A man lives rather in thought than in years," he said: "a trite maxim. I mean,
                  Harry, that between last year and to-day a great gulf seems to have been thrown
                  for me, and I add that 't is you who have opened it."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry—I can not help it. Do not let my griefs trouble you."</p>
               <p>"I must," said honest Tom Alston, with feeling; "I can not prevent it. Why will
                  you thus cling to a delirium? Why ruin yourself for a chimera?"</p>
               <p>"A chimera?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Harry, it is even worse! You think that young girl is faithless to you."</p>
               <p>"Do not use the word faithless," said St. John, with tranquil sadness.</p>
               <p>"What then shall I say?"</p>
               <p>"Say that I am unfortunate; that she is not to blame—only changeable, like
                  women—even the best of them."</p>
               <p>"No, I say that there is some mystery in this affair which must be cleared
                  up."</p>
               <p>"Some mystery?"</p>
               <p>"Assuredly—oh! most assuredly. What it is I can not say—but I stake my life upon
                  the fact."</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John gazed at him with sad surprise.</p>
               <p>"You 're a good friend, Tom," he said; "you are faithful to the end, and I thank
                  you. But you convince me not at all. You told me that you had made every effort to
                  discover this mystery—that you were constantly repulsed—that she would tell you
                  nothing, always turning the conversation or retiring. Nought remains."</p>
               <p>"Why not go yourself?"</p>
               <p>"I would not!" said St. John haughtily; then with a sorrowful smile, "I ought not
                  to," he added. "You tell me yourself, Tom, that the family at Vanely no longer
                  think of me; well, were I to go thither, I should cause them to think of me with
                  bitterness—perhaps to insult me. No, no! 'tis better as it is. I shall bid them
                  farewell in<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC6146-00000198"/> a letter, when no word
                  shall indicate my sense of their seeming injustice, and then I shall go away,
                  never to return."</p>
               <p>"And break <emph>her</emph> heart!"</p>
               <p>St. John shook his head.</p>
               <p>"The time for such a thing is past," he said, "she no longer thinks of me. Some
                  one has long since filled my place in her affections. Do you think I blame her?
                  Alas! I do not. I am simply miserable. I blame no one. I am much changed. I say
                  that human nature is weak—that the strongest heart is feeble—that God has made
                  women fallible like men. I think she loved me once—with her whole heart I then
                  thought, and for ever. Well, she was a woman, and at best they are but women. My
                  prayers and blessing will always follow her; but we meet no more on this earth,
                  Tom."</p>
               <p>And Mr. St. John made a movement with his hand which indicated a desire on his
                  part that the subject should be abandoned.</p>
               <p>Tom Alston sighed and yielded. That honest heart was pained by the despair of his
                  friend; and in the conflict with the settled sadness of Mr. St. John, he gave way
                  and said nothing more.</p>
               <p>Mr. St. John had not spoken of the visit to Mammy Liza's cabin; for that encounter
                  had produced a more powerful effect upon his feelings than he cared to own. The
                  sight of her pale white face, her haunting eyes, her thin form—this sad vision had
                  left him strangely affected, and he had ridden slowly back to Williamsburg, musing
                  gloomily. They had met but for a moment, yet in that instant all the past had
                  seemed to rush upon him again, with its smiles and happiness, its joy and beauty.
                  As he gave her the letter which had saved his life, as he looked at the flower
                  which she held in her hand, as he took in at a glance all the details of that
                  countenance, toward which his heart still turned, as the Chaldean turns to his
                  star, his resolution had almost melted—his strength had nearly given way as he
                  bowed to her, it had required all his self-control not to seize her thin hand and
                  press it to his trembling lips, and moisten it with his tears.</p>
               <p>He had not done so, he had only bowed and came away; and now he was more sad than
                  before, almost yielding to his emotion, and uttering a groan as he finally bade
                  adieu to all his hopes and his love.</p>
               <p>They went on silently thus in the sunset, and soon came in front of a cottage
                  embowered in foliage and flowers. It was Roseland.</p>
               <p>Blossom played as of old upon the grassplat; and, as she recognized her friend,
                  the child's face filled with blushes of happiness, and she ran toward him.</p>
               <p>"Let us dismount a moment, Tom," said St. John, "I must not neglect my
                  friends."</p>
               <p>As he spoke, the young man affixed the bridle of his horse to the fence, and
                  accompanied by Tom Alston, slowly entered the grounds of the cottage.</p>
               <p>Blossom had for visitor, her friend and admirer, Paul Effingham, Esquire—and this
                  young gentleman now abandoned an immense pile of flowers which he was weaving into
                  a garland, intended to encircle Miss Blossom's shoulders and waist, to come and
                  welcome his friends.</p>
               <p>He shook hands with Mr. St. John and Mr. Alston with great good feeling, and with
                  an impressive air asked them how they were.</p>
               <p>As for Blossom, she held Mr. St. John's other hand tightly, looking sadly into his
                  thin pale face, and seemed to prefer that gentleman's society to her
                  admirer's.</p>
               <p>St. John looked at the child with a smile which was not so sad. Blossom had
                  increased considerably in stature, and was now almost as tall as Mr. Paul
                  Effingham. She might now have stood on the base of Lord Botetourt's statue, and
                  clasped that good nobleman's waist instead of his knee, and omitted entirely the
                  ceremony of kneeling on the shoulder of her devoted cavalier.</p>
               <p>"And how have you been this long, long time, my child?"<pb n="396-397"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000199"/> said St. John, caressing kindly the soft hair. "I
                  see that the blossom is as bright as ever on your cheek. You are happy and well,
                  are you not, my dear?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said the child, "I am very well indeed, but—but—I am not happy, I
                  think—"</p>
               <p>"Pray why?"</p>
               <p>Blossom was silent a moment, gazing sadly on the thin face of her friend.</p>
               <p>"I am grieved because you look pale and unhappy," she murmured; "something grieves
                  you; won't you tell me what it is?"</p>
               <p>St. John smiled sadly and shook his head.</p>
               <p>"Am I changed?" he said.</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, sir! when you were here before you looked stronger and brighter."</p>
               <p>"That was because the sun was rising for me, Blossom. Since then my day has
                  passed. It is setting now."</p>
               <p>And St. John gazed calmly on the great orb sinking in the forest.</p>
               <p>"I understand you," said the child, in a low voice, "you are not happy. But you
                  know the sun will rise again tomorrow."</p>
               <p>The young man looked at the child, as she spoke, with an air of such hopeless
                  sadness, that the tears rushed to her eyes. He saw them, and was pained at her
                  pain.</p>
               <p>"There, there, my dear," he said, "do n't cry, for you distress me. See, I smile,
                  and, who knows? when I come again I may be laughing. Paul has finished your
                  garland. See, he hands it out to you."</p>
               <p>And taking the wreath of flowers, he put it around her shoulders. Then he pressed
                  the child's hand and bade her good bye, with a request that she would tell her
                  father of his visit.</p>
               <p>The friends returned to Williamsburg, and parted with a close grasp of the hand,
                  and an appointment to meet again on the morrow.</p>
               <p>"The sun may rise again," murmured St. John, as he sought his lodgings, "and the
                  flowers may blossom again, but my sunshine and flowers are all gone. So be it! A
                  few heavy years, some more pain and heart-burning—then I 'll sleep."</p>

               <p>IT was nearly midnight, and St. John was standing listlessly on the door-step of
                  the house he occupied, when raising his eyes, he saw the glimmer of a light in the
                  tall tower where the stranger pursued his labors.</p>
               <p>He hesitated for a moment, but soon made up his mind. He slowly set forward toward
                  the light.</p>
               <p>He quickly reached the house, and ascended the winding stair-case. The stranger
                  awaited him, with outstretched hand, on the threshold.</p>
               <p>"Welcome, friend," said the worker, who was clad as before in his somber black
                  dress, "welcome back to the capital. I was waiting for you, and knew your
                  footstep."</p>
               <p>St. John returned the iron grasp of the slender hand, and took the seat which was
                  offered him.</p>
               <p>"You awaited me?" he said; "how is that? Did you then know of my arrival?"</p>
               <p>"Three days before you came I expected you. As you know, I have many
                  correspondents, and I heard of your journey from three sources—but first from
                  General Lewis."</p>
               <p>And the stranger touched a letter lying upon the top of an enormous pile similar
                  to it.</p>
               <p>St. John nodded.</p>
               <p>"I see," he said, "and it will make an account of my sickness unnecessary; perhaps
                  I need not even speak of my adventures on the border."</p>
               <p>"It is useless, I may as well say frankly. I know all that<pb n="398-399"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000200"/> happened to you—your wound, your journey in the
                  litter, your return. My correspondent gave me every detail."</p>
               <p>St. John nodded again.</p>
               <p>"Well," he said, "so I come back. You see I have not carried out my plan of going
                  down Belle Riviere and the Mississippi. I go to Europe by the eastern route."</p>
               <p>And St. John sat down opposite the stranger. That personage, for some reason, did
                  not seem disposed to combat the resolution of his companion; he did not reply even
                  to his last observation. He remained motionless for a moment, leaning his pale
                  face on his hand, and then taking a letter from a drawer, carefully read it. He
                  then returned it, and said,</p>
               <p>"Well, friend, we won't discuss your movements at present; the future can take
                  care of itself. Let us converse as friends. You seem sad, and are very pale."</p>
               <p>"As you know, I have been sick."</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"And as you do not know, my character is changed."</p>
               <p>"I know that too."</p>
               <p>St. John looked at the stranger.</p>
               <p>"How?" he said.</p>
               <p>"Friend," said his companion, leaning back in his chair, and gazing thoughtfully
                  at Mr. St. John, "to an eye so practiced as my own, 't is not a difficult thing to
                  penetrate that calmness which envelops grief and hopelessness. You are no longer
                  the gay cavalier; you are the thoughtful man of sorrow."</p>
               <p>"Well, yes," said St. John, "I am as much."</p>
               <p>"You have yielded in the conflict with despair."</p>
               <p>"I am calm."</p>
               <p>"I see. That is just what I say. You retire from all struggles henceforth—you seek
                  merely oblivion."</p>
               <p>"You read my heart, friend," said the young man, gloomily.</p>
               <p>"I know I do, and I say to you that your resolution is unworthy of a brave
                  man!"</p>
               <p>St. John nodded.</p>
               <p>"So be it," he said; "I am no longer brave."</p>
               <p>"That may be, but you have your duty, and you shrink from it."</p>
               <p>"What duty?"</p>
               <p>"The struggle with wrong."</p>
               <p>St. John said nothing for some minutes; then, raising his head:</p>
               <p>"Do you know, friend," he said, "that life no longer affects me—its sorrows or
                  joys, or good or evil? If I were not a stoic I should be an epicurean. Let society
                  go its ways; it does not concern me. I do not deny that once I thought
                  differently, but opinions often change as we grow older. As for me, my strength is
                  quite broken. I could not, if I would, enter the contest."</p>
               <p>He was silent, and the stranger seemed to acquiesce in his plain wish to change
                  the subject. He made a slow and measured movement with his head, and replied,</p>
               <p>"So be it; but you may yet change your views. Events are now on the brink of an
                  abyss, into which we 'll all be plunged. The revolution rushes on, and to-morrow
                  may be a day of history."</p>
               <p>"To-morrow?"</p>
               <p>"I mean any day now, for the storm is about to burst! You have been away, and do
                  not know how the country speaks of Dunmore, how the minds of men have been
                  striding on toward the battle field. Within the year which ends next month, the
                  North American provinces have advanced toward rebellion with far greater rapidity
                  than within the entire ten years preceding. In '65, as I have before said, the
                  seeds of revolution were scattered broadcast by the voice of Patrick Henry; well,
                  in these ten years they have been ripening, now they burst into the air. In May of
                  last year, as you remember, the Boston Port bill was passed, and you were witness
                  of the effect which it produced upon the Burgesses and upon the people. That
                  outrage brought forth the general congress, which Virginia proposed six days
                     before<pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC6146-00000201"/> fore Massachusetts, though it
                  was also original with the men of the North, since no communication could have
                  taken place. That congress met at Philadelphia; the Virginia convention also met
                  last month, in the old church where we first came together, when, as you will
                  recollect, I was looking at the edifice with this very thing in view. The general
                  congress spoke boldly, but the Virginia convention struck the face of royalty with
                  its gauntlet! It was the voice of Patrick Henry which resounded again, for he saw
                  that the time had come!"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said St. John.</p>
               <p>"It was Dunmore himself," continued the stranger, with gloomy pleasure; "it was
                  Dunmore who placed his shoulder to the car which will finally crush him! And here
                  see the wondrous ways of Providence! the proof that all men are puppets in an
                  invisible hand! At the moment when the general congress rose in Philadelphia, this
                  man was plotting treachery upon the Sciota! He thought that he was banding the
                  savages against Virginia in silence and secrecy; he was only arousing more
                  violently the popular fury. Every letter from the camp of General Lewis made the
                  waters of revolution boil and foam more angrily! A popular idea for the crisis was
                  needed, an especial treason on the part of the government. Dunmore went a thousand
                  miles through the wilderness to supply it! He is the true author of the struggle
                  about to burst; his treachery will bear Dead Sea fruits; by him the discordant
                  elements are combined; before, there was dissension and difference, but now there
                  is none. The phalanx moves forward, fully armed and in order!"</p>
               <p>The stranger paused for a moment, and then continued.</p>
               <p>"You may not fully realize as I do, friend," he said, "the full meaning of those
                  words, 'discordant elements.' Listen, however, and I think I can tell you what
                  they signify. The society of Virginia is essentially composite—made up of a
                  variety of classes. To ascertain the character of these classes, to analyze the
                  elements which will enter into the struggle before us—this has long been my study
                  and my passion. A poor engineer, but, delegated to touch the fuse, it has been my
                  great subject of investigation, the nature and the properties of this splendid
                  ordnance which will batter down the walls of royalty in America, sending its roar
                  of triumph over the ruins!</p>
               <p>"In Virginia, then, there are twenty different classes—from the indented servant
                  who toils on the glebe, and the fisherman who sleeps in the sunshine, to the great
                  landed proprietor who rolls by in his coach, and lives like a feudal baron on his
                  splendid estate. The intermediate grades are immensely diversified, but, as far as
                  politics go, there are but three prominent classes. They are, first, patriotic
                  conservatives, with a sprinkling of royalists or tories; next, advocates of
                  revolution, prepared to go all lengths; lastly, men who wait for events, and
                  conceal their sentiments, read to join either side, if it acquires the
                  ascendency.</p>
               <p>"The first of these classes embraces the great landed proprietors. They are the
                  sons or grandsons of English younger sons who came here and obtained, by industry
                  or favor, large tracts on the banks of our rivers. In the first generation they
                  often lived rudely, and worked hard; in the second or third, they roll in coaches,
                  and live splendidly. They are cavaliers, or gentlemen—call them what you
                  please—essentially of the old English stock of country gentlemen. They have, many
                  of them, been educated in England, and have traveled on the continent. They have
                  thus imbibed the traditions of the past. On their walls hang the portraits of
                  their ancestors, and they read of these personages in the memoirs of past ages.
                  Thus, every thing combines to make these men royalists: family pride, education,
                  the fear of innovation on their class, and the dread of Democracy. They are
                  members of the established Church of England, and believe in the apostolic
                  succession. They are attached to that constitutional royalty which recognizes the
                  monarch as the first gentleman of his kingdom. They like the order of nobility
                  because a step only separates them from its elevation—a step which has often been
                  passed over. They believe in those 'degrees in a state' which Shakspeare<pb
                     n="402-403" xml:id="VAC6146-00000202"/> tells of—they believe that they are
                  better than the commoners. They love, in a word, the whole machinery of the
                  English system, and recoil at the thought of opposing her.</p>
               <p>"This class, thus imperfectly outlined, has longed for an arrangement of the
                  present difficulties—a peaceful solution of all dissensions. They have voted, in
                  the Burgesses, for petitions and protests, but their protests have always ended
                  with a clause about 'his Majesty's most loyal humble servants and subjects.' They
                  shudder and draw back when the word <emph>revolution</emph> is uttered, and they
                  cling to the past, to the habitudes of London, to the sentiments and views of
                  their fathers.</p>
               <p>"Now for the second class, the advocates of revolution—those fiery souls who
                  inhale the odor of the muttering tempest, and rejoice as they descry its approach.
                  These are men of less property, though similar origin. They live, for the most
                  part, upon small estates, and ride to court with their saddle-bags, and dress
                  carelessly. They do not cultivate that suavity and repose which is the aim of the
                  rich planter; they wear no velvet or lace; they speak often uncouthly, but with a
                  rough eloquence which arouses. In the West they are often mountain hunters,
                  depending for support, in a measure, on their rifles, clad in hunting-shirts and
                  deer-skin buskins. They have few family traditions, and no portraits. Their
                  ancestors could not fee Sir Godfrey Kneller or Van Dyck. They breathe the winds of
                  the great mountains, hear the noise of the torrents; the eagle screams, from the
                  clouds, above their lodges in the clefts of the Alleghanies, and he is not more
                  free and disdainful of control than themselves. These men not only do not stand in
                  awe of royalty—they do not understand or think of it. It has never come to molest
                  them in their far mountain eyries, and they care as little for the aristocracy of
                  the lowland. They listen, as in a dream, when you tell them of the chariots, and
                  gold plate, and the opulence of the Tidewater. They nod their heads, and tell you
                  that your story is interesting; then they play with their great rifles, and follow
                  the flight of an eagle with their eyes, and go, singing, up the mountain, thinking
                  only of the buck hunt on the morrow. When the planter of the East turns in bed to
                  take his second nap, the hunter is following the deer over the breezy hills, or
                  dashing aside the waves of the Kanawha with the paddle of his gum-tree canoe. The
                  elegantly-clad cavalier receives his guests at the door of his fine mansion,
                  bowing low as he assists the dames from their coaches; the mountaineer is telling
                  stories to his comrades around the camp fire. As the minuet commences, with its
                  dazzling figures and stately music, the hunter falls asleep beneath the stars.
                  These men, the yeomen of the East and the mountaineers of the West, form the
                  second class—almost ignorant of royalty, and careless of its doings, but ready to
                  march on it, and strike it mortally when it invades their territory, as they would
                  a wolf or a panther. But I mistake. Ten years ago this was just the picture.
                  To-day these men have made the acquaintance of his Majesty and of Parliament. They
                  have not said much, but they have looked to their rifles. You will see them in
                  Williamsburg soon; Goths and Huns in the streets of Rome.</p>
               <p>"I have said that the third class embraced the hangerson—those men who watch
                  events, and are prepared to side with the strongest. They are factors, for the
                  most part, who have 'moneys' involved in the issue—who do not wish to quarrel with
                  the planters, and await their action. They opposed the non-intercourse association
                  of last year because it injured their business; they trade now in their
                  patriotism, and await the rising of the curtain. Enough of them.</p>
               <p>"Well, now, friend," the stranger continued, "you see the issue; you see the
                  elements which will enter into this struggle. I commenced by saying that the
                  action of Dunmore had combined these discordant elements; and I think you
                  comprehend what I meant.</p>
               <p>"The great planters, the first class, love England and their old traditions, but
                  they are true Englishmen, and love their personal liberty more. They are afraid of
                     Democracy,<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC6146-00000203"/> but they are more afraid
                  of Parliament. They would risk their lives to preserve the legitimate action of
                  the sovereign from insult; they will die before they 'll bow to what is despotism.
                  Well, the treachery of Dunmore has revolted this class profoundly; his insults
                  have aroused their hot blood; they hate him, and hate the government which
                  instructed him, and are ready to strike him. They overmatch, lastly, the pure
                  royalists so immensely that this element is completely paralyzed.</p>
               <p>"The second class, the yeomen and the hunters, are aroused, too—that is, made to
                  see that the time has come. They now understand that their own is a popular
                  sentiment—that, when they march, it will be with an ever-increasing force as they
                  proceed. They feel that the treachery of Dunmore has matured all: they unite with
                  the planters.</p>
               <p>"The third class are accustomed to watch the times. They see that the liberty
                  stock is rising. They begin to understand that their debts to English houses will
                  be abrogated by a struggle with the mother country. They now press forward, and
                  are flaming patriots. They shout 'Liberty!' and then look round for applause. It
                  is Dunmore's treachery which has decided these men, too: they march with the
                  rest.</p>
               <p>"Well, friend," added the stranger, raising his head, "you now know what has taken
                  place in your absence. The tornado, long blowing, is beginning to roar; royal
                  authority trembles in the balance, and is weighed, and found wanting. The fiery
                  finger has traced the flaming letters on the wall, <foreign xml:lang="HEB">Mene,
                     mene, tekel, upharsin!</foreign> 'God hath numbered thy kingdom and finished
                  it!' The monarch, in his palace, already hears the roar of the unloosed waters.
                  Those waters commenced, a mere rill, a thread upon the expanse of the land; but
                  they have rolled on and gathered strength; from year to year they have increased;
                  at last they rush toward the sea, whose surges are lashed by the tempest! On the
                  banks of the great stream a poor wanderer stands musing. It is myself, friend! My
                  part has been to follow it in its august flow from the source—to remove, when I
                  could, the obstructions in its bed—to widen and clear out the channel. If I have
                  assisted, thus, the infant stream of Liberty, I have not lived in vain. My mission
                  was to perform this service, and I have tried to fulfill it. The stream rushes
                  onward now, and I disappear. Henceforth there is little for me to do but to throw
                  myself into the current and share its fate. Swallowed up in the billows, lost in
                  the ranks, I have, henceforth, my arm alone to offer. Seek me here in the autumn
                  of this year and, I predict, you will not find me. Before that time, all will be
                  decided; even now events rush to their fulfillment!"</p>
               <p>As the stranger spoke, the neigh of a distant horse was heard, and, bending
                  forward, he listened.</p>
               <p>"They are on their march!" he said.</p>
               <p>"Whom?" said St. John, rising.</p>
               <p>"Wait; you will see," and the stranger led the way to the open window.</p>
               <p>It was a clear, moonlight night, and the mellow radiance slept peacefully on the
                  roofs of the houses. No sound disturbed the deep silence except the murmur of the
                  sea breeze dying away in the distance.</p>
               <p>But as St. John and the stranger leaned forth and listened, a second neigh, much
                  closer than the first, was borne on the night wind to their ears.</p>
               <p>Then, in the deep silence, a measured tramp was heard, sabers gleamed in the
                  moonlight, and a body of men advanced along Gloucester street, and turned into
                  Palace street.</p>
               <p>At the head of these men rode a horseman wrapped in a cloak, and it was his animal
                  which had neighed.</p>
               <p>From their lofty post the stranger and St. John witnessed the silent advance of
                  the company, and soon saw a light glimmer in a window of the palace, before which
                  the men halted.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said St. John, "these are—"</p>
               <p>"Marines from the schooner Magdalen, which lies at Burwell's<pb n="406-407"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000204"/> well's Ferry on James river, yonder. The horseman
                  is Captain Collins."</p>
               <p>"What is their object?"</p>
               <p>"Look and listen, friend," said the stranger, "and you will see."</p>
               <p>St. John leaned further out and listened, a color for the first time invading his
                  pale cheek, and his eyes ardently plunging into half darkness.</p>
               <p>A colloquy seemed to be going on in front of the palace, but this lasted for a few
                  minutes only. Almost immediately the noise of wheels was heard, and the chariot of
                  Lord Dunmore, drawn by six horses, and surrounded by his guards, commanded by
                  Lindon, drove slowly, and with apparent caution, out of Palace street, and
                  disappeared in the direction of Montebello, the Governor's mansion, some six miles
                  below Williamsburg.</p>
               <p>"Do you understand?" said the stranger, whose lips wore an expression of the most
                  withering scorn; "do you know what that means, friend?"</p>
               <p>"Speak!"</p>
               <p>"His Excellency flies to his country seat, leaving his family behind!"</p>
               <p>"Flies! What is his fear?"</p>
               <p>"Listen and look!"</p>
               <p>As the stranger spoke, he extended his hand in the moonlight, and St. John saw the
                  troop of men march to the powder magazine, rapidly place fifteen or twenty barrels
                  of powder in carts, and then quickly retrace their steps in the direction from
                  which they had come.</p>
               <p>"They are disarming the town!" cried St. John, starting up, and drawing his sword;
                  "give the alarm, friend, or they will escape!"</p>
               <p>And he threw himself toward the door, with flashing eyes, and cheeks crimson with
                  passion.</p>
               <p>The heavy hand of the stranger violently arrested him. St. John looked impatiently
                  at the hand on his shoulder, at the cold and collected face.</p>
               <p>"Why do you stop me?" he said.</p>
               <p>"Because I do not recognize your right to forestall events and embarrass the
                  cause."</p>
               <p>"Embarrass!"</p>
               <p>"Yes. Can you misunderstand?"</p>
               <p>"Speak!"</p>
               <p>"That powder is, in all, fifteen half barrels of fifty pounds each. We have ten
                  times the amount safely stored. It is necessary that this powder should be
                  removed. It was foreseen—"</p>
               <p>"Foreseen!"</p>
               <p>"By myself and others. Were you to arouse Williamsburg now you would oppose some
                  frightened burghers, half asleep, to a band of armed marines, stimulated by drink.
                  The result would be unnecessary loss of life and defeat. The injury to the cause
                  is, however, the paramount thing."</p>
               <p>"Injury!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, friend," said the stranger, coolly, "I repeat that it is in the first degree
                  desirable that Lord Dunmore should perfect this outrage. In a week you will
                  understand me. The powder is valueless—the outrage is of immense value to the
                  cause! Do you not comprehend the enormous importance of this blow—of an armed
                  encounter between the Governor and the people, before an overwhelming force is
                  marched hither? The great masses busy themselves little about abstract principles,
                  but every one will understand this midnight robbery. In ten days Virginia will
                  thrill to her remotest borders with wrath and indignation. I would not, for the
                  whole English arsenal in the Tower, have that powder obstructed—have those men
                     molested!<ref rend="super" target="#note_040" xml:id="return_040">*</ref> Do

               <p>St. John fell back, murmuring.</p>
               <p>"Let us now get some sleep, for the events of the morrow will need fresh arms,
                  perhaps, friend," said the stranger; "it is Dunmore who plays our whole game for
                  us. He is but a tyro! for he 's staked the authority of his<pb n="408-409"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000205"/> master in Virginia against eight barrels of powder,
                  and he 'll lose!"</p>
               <p>With which words the stranger coolly resumed his seat.</p>
               <p>St. John retired to his lodgings, making an appointment to meet the stranger at
                  the Raleigh at sunrise, and soon the town was as silent as before.</p>
               <p>The powder marauders, with their illustrious master, had come and gone as silently
                  as shadows.</p>

               <head type="sub">WILLIAMSBURG IN ARMS, AND CAPTAIN RALPH WATERS IN ECSTACIES.</head>
               <p>AT sunrise the stranger and St. John met in front of the Raleigh, and in fifteen
                  minutes the intelligence of the removal of the powder had run like wildfire
                  through the town.</p>
               <p>All Williamsburg flew to arms.</p>
               <p>Every moment the crowds at the corners increased, and these crowds were harangued
                  by orators of the common people, who sprung up thus in an instant, and rode for
                  the moment upon the popular current.</p>
               <p>Execrations directed at Lord Dunmore resounded upon every side, and a hoarse
                  murmur, rising at times into a roar, indicated the depth of the feeling which this
                  last outrage had aroused and pushed into action.</p>
               <p>As the morning drew on, the crowd ever grew more dense and more furious; for it
                  was found, that in addition, the muskets in the magazine had been deprived of
                  their locks. The gentlemen of the town, and some members of the Governor's
                  council, in vain attempted to calm the tumult.</p>
               <p>The people of Williamsburg were completely aroused, and like most popular bodies,
                  only waited for a leader to proceed to acts of violence.</p>
               <p>This leader presented himself in the person of a country lawyer, who sprang upon a
                  barrel-head at the door of a shop and announced that the palace floor was covered
                  with muskets, and that Lord Dunmore had hastened to Montebello to arm his negroes,
                  and the Shawnee hostages brought back from the frontier.</p>
               <p>The intelligence fell like fire upon gunpowder. A hoarse roar issued from the
                  crowd, and like an immense wave of the ocean, it surged toward the palace, which
                  was surrounded in an instant by the shouting and furious inhabitants.</p>
               <p>At the front gate stood his Excellency's chariot, which had just returned from
                  Montebello, and as the multitude rushed toward the spot, Lady Dunmore and her
                  daughters were just stepping into the vehicle.</p>
               <p>Before they could do so, they were jostled aside by some of the crowd, and violent
                  hands were laid upon the bridles of the rearing horses. The driver sat pale and
                  trembling, scarcely able to hold the reins; and Lady Dunmore and her daughters
                  trembled too.</p>
               <p>It was but an instant that they were thus subjected to insult.</p>
               <p>A sword flashed in the air—a vigorous arm hurled back the assailants, who were the
                  mere scum of the multitude, that vulgar froth, so to speak, which floats on the
                  purest waters—and looking up, Lady Dunmore and her daughters encountered the pale
                  face of St. John, which was cold, but fiery with indignation.</p>
               <p>"Your ladyship need fear no violence," said the young man; "myself, and Captain
                  Waters here, will see that you are treated with respect. Before your ladyship is
                  insulted by any one, I 'll sheathe my sword in his heart."</p>
               <p>And confronting the assailants, Mr. St. John met their furious glances with a look
                  which indicated that he was both ready and willing to carry out his threat.</p>
               <p>"That 's the word, Harry my boy!" said Captain Waters, pushing through to his
                  side. "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Morbleu!</foreign> I 'll stand by you there—and her
                  ladyship can proceed."</p>
               <pb n="410-411" xml:id="VAC6146-00000206"/>
               <p>Lady Dunmore, still trembling, got into the carriage, followed by her daughters,
                  and assisted by Mr. St. John: and then the crowd opening, the chariot was
                  permitted to proceed.</p>
               <p>St. John exchanged a glance with young Lady Augusta, who thanked him with that
                  grateful look for his devotion. But he had only repaid her kindness to Blossom,
                  when the child nearly fainted, and was cheered by the girl.</p>
               <p>The crowd thus permitted the Governor's family to depart, disowning the vulgar
                  assault of the understrappers; but the palace of the hateful Governor
                  remained.</p>
               <p>They seized all the arms, which were ranged in long rows upon the floor; and took
                  prisoner the private secretary of his Excellency.</p>
               <p>Captain Foy looked around him for a moment like an infuriated tiger—cold, but
                  burning with rage. Then he calmly went on with his writing.</p>
               <p>"My dear Foy," said Captain Waters, as the tide of invaders flowed away, leaving
                  them nearly alone, "do you know that you really fill me with admiration? <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">Parbleu!</foreign> we seem vulgar urchins beside you. I
                  recognize my superior; and rather than see you assailed by the good people of the
                  town, I will die on the threshold of your apartment."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, captain," said Foy coolly, "that sounds like a comrade."</p>
               <p>"It sounds true, my dear Foy. I have no idea of letting some vulgar fellow run you
                  through. I reserve that pleasure for myself."</p>
               <p>Foy smiled sardonically.</p>
               <p>"I think, from present appearances, you 'll soon have an occasion, captain," he
                  said; "events are thickening, and the pen yields to the sword."</p>
               <p>"Certainly it does, and that 's right."</p>
               <p>"I agree with you."</p>
               <p>"The sword will serve his Excellency better than the pen, eh?"</p>
               <p>"Such is my opinion, captain," said Foy, coolly.</p>
               <p>"You confess, then, that the goose quill 's but a sorry tool—that it has not
                  succeeded?"</p>
               <p>"Succeeded, captain?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my dear Foy. It is obvious to all now that his Excellency's chief rascal,
                  Conolly, took advantage of the confiding disposition of his lordship, and deceived
                  him; that his Excellency's treachery quite failed."</p>
               <p>"Captain Waters—!"</p>
               <p>"My dear Foy!" said the captain with a polite air.</p>
               <p>"It is perilous to speak thus of his Majesty's representative!"</p>
               <p>"Representative!—where?"</p>
               <p>"In Williamsburg."</p>
               <p>"If you refer to Dunmore, my dear friend, I reply simply that he 's not here.
                  Having abstracted—I believe that 's the polite word—our powder, his lordship is
                  amusing himself making fireworks at Montebello, having doubtless forgotten his
                  wife and daughters."</p>
               <p>"He is still the Governor, sir."</p>
               <p>"Then we are unfortunate, for we 've a coward for a ruler. Come, do n't think me
                  rude, my dear Foy. I declare it to be my opinion that the man who runs away to
                  escape popular wrath, and leaves his family behind to meet the shock which he
                  knows will come—this personage, I am constrained to declare, in all simplicity, a
                  coward; and that is worse than a traitor. His Excellency, I regret to say, is
                  both."</p>
               <p>"Captain Waters, do you consider it grateful to insult a prisoner?"</p>
               <p>"Insult!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, me sir!"</p>
               <p>"Insult you, my dear Foy, and at present? I would sooner cut off my right hand,
                  and have my ears nailed to a pillory."</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, this insult to his Excellency is an insult to me."</p>
               <pb n="412-413" xml:id="VAC6146-00000207"/>
               <p>The captain stood dumbfoundered at this new view, and the longer he reflected, the
                  more just did it seem.</p>
               <p>He drew back and sighed.</p>
               <p>"My dear Foy," he said, "I am absent this morning, and that never occurred to me.
                  You see I was only jesting, and I would n't hurt your feelings for the world. My
                  real opinion of his lordship is quite different. I regard him as the model of a
                  gentleman and a cavalier. In all the relations of life he shines preëminent; he
                  touches nothing which he do n't adorn; the Latin's escaped me, if I ever knew
                  it."</p>
               <p>The same sardonic smile wreathed the corners of Foy's mouth.</p>
               <p>"I 'm glad your real opinion of his Excellency is different, captain," he
                  said.</p>
               <p>"Different! I should say it was. Could you think for a moment, my dear comrade,
                  that I attached any credit to the vulgar rumors of the day? The idea of a
                     <emph>nobleman</emph> being guilty of treachery and cowardice! My amazement at
                  this charge is so great that I feel as if some one had cuffed me on my head! I 'll
                  uphold his lordship as the grandest of his order, and I 'll cram down the throats
                  of his enemies their accusations!"</p>
               <p>A rather poor commentary upon the captain's sincerity was instantly afforded.</p>
               <p>The crowd had taken all the muskets, disarmed the servants, and now they came to
                  the apartment in which Foy was under guard, muttering "traitor!" and a variety of
                  other criticisms of his Excellency.</p>
               <p>No insult or violence was offered to Captain Foy, however, and they even permitted
                  him to retain his papers.</p>
               <p>In the afternoon, the guard was withdrawn, and he was at liberty. The secretary
                  received the intimation as coolly as before, and continued his writing.</p>
               <p>The palace and the grounds were by this time vacated, and another portion of the
                  inhabitants, who had armed themselves to march and attack the Magdalen, and
                  recover the powder, returned to their homes.</p>
               <p>This moderation of the popular excitement was due to the exertions of the members
                  of the Governor's council, who earnestly dissuaded the people from violence. They
                  recommended a meeting of the town in its corporate capacity, and the meeting was
                  held at once.</p>
               <p>The result was an address to his Excellency, in which the Common Council
                  represented that the "inhabitants of the city had been that morning exceedingly
                  alarmed by a report that a large quantity of gunpowder was, in the preceding
                  night, while they were sleeping in their beds, removed from the public magazine in
                  the city, and conveyed, under an escort of marines, on board one of his Majesty's
                  armed vessels lying at a ferry on James river;" that "the magazine was erected at
                  the public expense of the colony," for arming the militia, "in cases of invasion
                  and insurrection," and they desired "to be informed by his Excellency, upon what
                  motives and for what motives and for what particular purpose the powder had been
                  carried off in such a manner," and ended by requesting that it might be
                  "immediately returned to the magazine."</p>
               <p>His Excellency returned, verbally, the reply, that he had heard of "an
                  insurrection in a neighboring county," and had removed the powder to a place of
                  safety. Whenever it was wanted, <emph>upon his word of honor,</emph> it should be
                  delivered in half an hour. He had removed it in the night time to prevent any
                  alarm, and was surprised to hear the people were under arms; he could not trust
                  them with powder. That was all the reply.</p>
               <p>On the next day, Captain Collins and some of his men entered Williamsburg, and
                  swaggered about the streets, and in the evening the captain and Foy rode to
                  Montebello, returning at twilight.</p>
               <p>On the next morning, his Excellency sent word by one of the magistrates that "if
                  any insult were offered to Captain Foy, or Captain Collins, he would <emph>declare
                     freedom to the slaves and lay the town in ashes,</emph>" adding that he could
                  easily depopulate the county.</p>
               <pb n="414-415" xml:id="VAC6146-00000208"/>
               <p>His lordship finding this threat received without open exhibitions of resistance,
                  then returned with his guards to Williamsburg.</p>
               <p>On the next evening, Captain Foy was proceeding toward the palace when he met
                  Captain Waters.</p>
               <p>"Have you heard the news, my dear friend?" said Waters.</p>
               <p>"No, captain," returned Foy.</p>
               <p>"Well, I 'll tell you. That scoundrel, General Gage, who represents his most
                  Christian Majesty in Boston, has removed their powder, as his Excellency kindly
                  did ours. The result has been a battle at Lexington and Concord, on the very day
                  that Captain Collins marched to Williamsburg and robbed the magazine. Can you
                  conceive of such a rascally coincidence, my dear Foy?"</p>
               <p>"Captain Waters!" said Foy, coloring, "are you aware, sir, that you utter
                  sedition?"</p>
               <p>"Sedition, my dear Foy?" returned Waters; "well, I believe all Williamsburg is
                  assisting me."</p>
               <p>"All Williamsburg, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my dear friend. The Raleigh's in a flame from the news, and it 's rapidly
                  spreading. As I observed, the general opinion is, that the removal of the powder
                  throughout America was concerted—done in obedience to orders from home. Eh? Was
                  n't it, my dear Foy?"</p>
               <p>"Seek intelligence elsewhere, Captain Waters," said Foy, passing on.</p>
               <p>"Well, I will," said Captain Ralph, smiling; "but let me finish, my dear Foy."</p>
               <p>"Proceed, sir."</p>
               <p>"If the removal of the powder here, and in Massachusetts, was concerted, you
                  see—"</p>
               <p>"Well, sir!"</p>
               <p>"In obedience to orders from London—"</p>
               <p>"Suppose it was, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Why, then, you see, I am cleared from any accusation of sedition, which is
                  libel," said the captain. "His Excellency lency said he removed it because there
                  was an insurrection in James City county; now, if he really did so, in obedience
                  to general orders, without reference to the insurrection, why it is obvious that
                  his Excellency has willfully lied, and the <emph>coincidence,</emph> as I said, is
                  in every sense <emph>rascally.</emph> It 's no libel, it 's the simple and plain
                  truth, my dear Foy!"</p>
               <p>Met thus by a direct and unmistakable insult, as gross as it was pointed, Foy
                  advanced a step and said, with a slight flush in his pale face,</p>
               <p>"Captain Waters, do you wish to visit the Fowey man-of-war in irons?"</p>
               <p>"Not at present, my dear Foy," said the captain.</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, if you wish to avoid it, I advise you to control your remarks."</p>
               <p>"What remarks?"</p>
               <p>"About his Excellency."</p>
               <p>"I have said nothing wrong."</p>
               <p>"You have charged him with falsehood, sir—plainly!"</p>
               <p>"Well, my dear Captain Foy, I think he has been guilty of that."</p>
               <p>"Captain Waters!"</p>
               <p>"And of cowardice."</p>
               <p>"Sir—!"</p>
               <p>"Treachery too, Foy," said Captain Waters, coolly, "and my own opinion is, that
                  you yourself have more or less to do with both the falsehood and the treachery.
                  You see, I acquit you of the cowardice for old acquaintance sake."</p>
               <p>Foy's hand darted to the hilt of his sword, and thus driven like a wild cat to the
                  wall, by these repeated insults, he would in an instant have rushed upon his
                  adversary.</p>
               <p>Before his sword, however, leaped from its scabbard, he heard a voice say, "His
                  lordship sends for you, sir," and turning round he found himself face to face with
                  the old usher in black velvet.</p>
               <p>A flush of rage and disappointment threw a lurid light upon the secretary's face,
                  and, advancing within two steps<pb n="416-417" xml:id="VAC6146-00000209"/> of
                  Waters, he said, between his clenched teeth, and in a low, hissing voice,</p>
               <p>"We shall meet again, sir, and I 'll wipe out the insults you have heaped upon me
                  with your heart's blood. I promise you that, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Good, good, my dear Foy!" said the captain, cheerfully; "that sort of talk really
                  delights me!"</p>
               <p>"I 'm glad you like it, sir," said Foy, pale with rage.</p>
               <p>"Like it? I believe you. It sounds like the sweetest winds of summer to my ears.
                  At last I shall learn the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coup de Reinfels,</foreign> and
                  perhaps in return teach you the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coup de Waters,</foreign>
                  you see!"</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, I 'll try and end your affectation and your boasting!"</p>
               <p>"My affectation! my boasting!" cried the captain; "see how an old comrade does
                  injustice to a friend! You think I boast, you think I affect! when all the time I
                  'm moved by a pure love of art."</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, I hope to show you the art of splitting tongues, and if I live I 'll
                  perform that service for you."</p>
               <p>"Split my tongue!" said the captain, cheerfully; "see here the coincidence of
                  genius. That is just what I 've long been wishing to do for you! Your tongue is
                  already forked like a snake's, my dear Foy, but I wish to improve it still
                  further!"</p>
               <p>It seemed that Captain Foy meditated again an instant rush upon his enemy, but
                  this idea was at once abandoned. With a hoarse grow! he turned away.</p>
               <p>"A last word, my dear Foy," said the captain; "let us exchange a parting assurance
                  of regard. I have a real affection for yourself and his Excellency, and you may
                  inform him that in forty-eight hours we intend to knock his house about his ears.
                  We are no longer restrained by a sentiment of politeness—the family of his
                  Excellency being absent. Perhaps their presence made him a coward, and, now they
                  are gone, he may fight. He has an elegant-looking guard, and a tall, ugly captain
                  thereof, named Lindon, which I regret gret, as I 'd like to spoil his beauty. I
                  say, you can inform his Excellency that we 're coming to pay him our respects, our
                  compliments, on the issue of the Indian affair, and to return him our thanks for
                  removing the powder out of reach of our slaves. He says we are traitors, and may
                  be cowards—well, 'birds of a feather,' you know. We think his Excellency's
                  admirable company for such folk! Go, my dear Foy! do n't keep his Excellency
                  waiting! He is doubtless devising new benefits for the colony, and needs your
                  valuable assistance."</p>
               <p>Foy walked away, shuddering with rage, but saying nothing; and Waters added, with
                  a laugh, as he disappeared around the corner,</p>
               <p>"Go on, my dear scorpion; I 'll soon draw your sting! the hours are ripening!"</p>
               <p>With these words, the captain twirled his huge mustache, and, with an expression
                  of radiant pleasure, sought the Raleigh, which, truly, was in a flame with the
                  news of Lexington and Concord.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER LXXVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">A MEETING OF PATRIOTS.</head>
               <p>INSTEAD of pausing to depict the excitement, the agitation, the fury, almost, of
                  Williamsburg, just informed, by expresses, of the events in the North—instead of
                  dwelling upon this picture, which the reader may very well fancy for himself, let
                  us follow the captain, and see where he goes. Perhaps we shall thus stumble upon
                  something.</p>
               <p>Just at twilight, Captain Waters mounted his horse, and, issuing from Williamsburg
                  toward the west, plunged into the great forest as the shades of night
                  descended.</p>
               <p>He proceeded silently through the wood until he reached the vicinity of the old
                  field school house, and then dismounting<pb n="418-419" xml:id="VAC6146-00000210"
                  /> mounting, tied his horse to the bough of a tree, and proceeded on fast toward
                  the building, in which a light glimmered.</p>
               <p>He passed a number of horses tied like his own, and soon came upon a figure which
                  advanced from the shadow of a tree, and hailed him:</p>
               <p>"'Liberty' 's the word, eh?" said the captain, shaking Mr. Lugg by the hand. "How
                  many are here, Lanky?"</p>
               <p>"A good many, captain," said Mr. Lugg. "Mr. Hamilton has just come."</p>
               <p>"Captain Hamilton, say! for I 'll vote for him."</p>
               <p>"What place will you take? They speak of you for captain."</p>
               <p>"The rear guard next to the enemy. I 'll not go before Jack."</p>
               <p>"Well, captain, I wish they would make me quartermaster."</p>
               <p>"Why so?"</p>
               <p>"I 'm terribly hungry," and Mr. Lugg applauded his joke.</p>
               <p>"You always were that, you rascal!" said the captain, cheerfully. "The amount of
                  bacon, bread and beer which you used to cost me was really immense."</p>
               <p>"Oh, cap'en!—that is, my dear captain," said Mr. Lugg, correcting his defective
                  pronunciation, and raising his head with all the dignity of a freeholder, "we have
                  forgotten those early days, I think."</p>
               <p>"You have," said the captain, twirling his mustache, "and that is the consequence
                  of a good action. It was all owing to me that you secured that incomparable Donsy,
                  formerly pupil of his Highness, Mr. Tag, in this very house; and, after all my
                  lies on that occasion, you wish to forget!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, captain!" said Mr. Lugg, with earnestness, "I 'll never forget all your
                  goodness. Donsy <emph>is</emph> a good wife, and I owe my getting her to you."</p>
               <p>"Very well, Scaramouche, that is honest, and I 'm coming next week to see the
                  juvenile Lankys. Have they pineknot heads?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, captain! but you talked of Tag."</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Well, he 's in there," said Mr. Lugg, pointing to the school house.</p>
               <p>"You do n't say so! A pedagogue?"</p>
               <p>"He was a soldier, you know, once."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and a great rascal. Well, well, it 's a good sign when the riff-raff adhere
                  to a cause. It proves that they think we 're going to succeed."</p>
               <p>"He talks mighty big," said Mr. Lugg.</p>
               <p>"And will walk big until the enemy comes along, when he 'll run," with which words
                  Captain Waters proceeded to the school house.</p>
               <p>About twenty men were assembled there—and Uncle Jimmy Doubleday presided. Around
                  him were grouped Mr. Jack Hamilton, Mr. Tag, and a variety of gentlemen, and in
                  the corner a sable personage with goggle eyes and clad in an enormous coat,
                  squatted down, and moved his midnight fingers to and fro on a fife.</p>
               <p>Uncle Jimmy opened the meeting, which had waited, apparently, only for the
                  captain, with an address setting forth its object.</p>
               <p>At that primitive period there were no short-hand reporters, and we regret our
                  inability to present more than the heads of his discourse.</p>
               <p>The late outrage—the designs of England—the schemes of Dunmore—the public
                  excitement—the march of Patrick Henry on Williamsburg, with the men of Hanover,
                  which the company now organizing was going to join—the duty of good citizens—the
                  blow that was to be struck, now or never—this was the train of Uncle Jimmy's
                  remarks. It seemed that they were very acceptable to the meeting; for when the old
                  gentleman made a final flourish with his glasses, and sat down, a murmur of
                  applause followed.</p>
               <p>The gentlemen then rose and pledged themselves for different numbers of men, to
                  meet at the rendezvous the next day. Then they proceeded to the election of
                  officers.</p>
               <pb n="420-421" xml:id="VAC6146-00000211"/>
               <p>Captain Waters declared that he should vote for Hamilton, peremptorily refusing to
                  command.</p>
               <p>He was urged to change his determination; but refusing, the meeting elected Mr.
                  Hamilton, who returned thanks.</p>
               <p>Other officers were then chosen, and lastly, the question of the commissariat was
                  raised.</p>
               <p>At this juncture—says the worthy author—our old and esteemed friend, Mr. Tag,
                  slowly rose from his seat. Age had not dimmed him in the least, or the pedagogue
                  rostrum staled his infinite vanity. He was still the brilliant mixture of the
                  soldier and the schoolmaster, the pedagogue and the politician, the civilian and
                  the warrior. Like Ulysses, the worthy Tag had seen many "climates, councils,
                  governments"—and if not "honored of them all," had at least been noticed, if 't
                  were only at a cart-tail.</p>
               <p>On the present occasion, the worthy Tag desired the commissariat. He made a
                  speech, declaring, of course, that he could not accept it. He finally relented,
                  however, and announced that if his friends chose to confer the office upon him, he
                  should not feel at liberty to refuse it; devotion to the public weal being the
                  first passion of his soul. His friend—he might almost say, his noble
                  friend—Captain Waters, knew that he was experienced in such things; and often, in
                  the Seven Years' War, they had slept together, in the next couch he was sorry to
                  say, to that viper, Captain Foy. He had always distrusted that man—from the first
                  he knew him to be a villain. In those complicated and entangled secret schemes
                  which to the everlasting shame of the English government, Lord Dunmore, with this
                  man, had projected"——</p>
               <p>Here symptoms of impatience on the part of the audience developed themselves.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tag therefore cut short his remarks by saying that if the commissariat was
                  bestowed upon him, he should be much flattered. And then he sat down in the spot
                  where he and Lanky had encountered each other in old days, sword against
                  tongs.</p>
               <p>Lanky was opposed to him now, and Lanky was elected.</p>
               <p>"Mas' Tag did n't do it dat time—he did n't," issued in a murmur of triumph from
                  the corner; "tread on my coat-tail, and knock me down and lam me—berry glad to
                  hear it, Mas' Tag!"</p>
               <p>Having made this remark, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">sotto voce,</foreign> Mr. Crow
                  subsided into silence and darkness, running his fingers along the fife and
                  grinning.</p>
               <p>The meeting had now concluded its business, and soon it rose.</p>
               <p>They had agreed upon a rendezvous early the next day, at Banks' cross-roads.</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Morbleu!</foreign>" said the captain, as he rode away
                  with Hamilton; "'t is strange how the sight of that building affected me. You
                  know, Jack, it 's an old acquaintance!"</p>
               <p>"Ah!"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said the captain, sighing and smiling, "you must have observed that amid
                  all the excitement, I was quiet—in the midst of the enthusiasm, I was thoughtful.
                  Do you know why?"</p>
               <p>"Tell me."</p>
               <p>"Because I was often there in the merry old days when I was courting Henrietta,
                  you know, Jack," said the captain smiling, and raising his fine and martial face
                  in the moonlight. "It was there that I remember leaning through the window, and
                  swearing back at Tag, when I went to get Donsy for Lanky Lugg. It was there that
                  the noble Lanky fought—an encounter which I arrived just in time to witness, and
                  whisk away the maiden Donsy in my chariot, in defiance of his excellency, Mr. Tag,
                  who had threatened to whip her, and made her cry. Faith! Lanky acted like a hero
                  that day, and would have demolished his enemy, but I held him back. Strange how
                  vivid all is! And now the clownish boy is married to the crying girl; and a new
                  generation thrusts the schoolmaster aside, and bestows its trust on the scholars.
                  That's what I call the long result of time—and I think my mustache is growing
                  gray!"</p>
               <pb n="422-423" xml:id="VAC6146-00000212"/>
               <p>The jovial soldier laughed as he spoke, but he sighed, too. There is no one but
                  feels, at times, this regret for the past—who does not gild thus the days that are
                  dead?</p>
               <p>"Well, well, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami,</foreign>" added the soldier, "all
                  that 's gone, and the new days are here—also a new generation. Let us act, and not
                  meditate. We 're to meet in the morning at Banks' cross-roads, where, formerly, I
                  encountered William Effingham, Esq. Well, I think there 'll be a real fight this
                  time—if not at the cross-roads, elsewhere. Let us hope so," and the friends rode
                  on through the moonlight.</p>

               <head type="sub">A YOUNG SPY.</head>
               <p>THE last person to leave the school house was Uncle Jimmy Doubleday, and the old
                  schoolmaster saw that all was secure before he departed.</p>
               <p>He tried all the shutters, set back the benches, and, finally, took the light and
                  proceeded toward the door.</p>
               <p>It was just at this moment that a voice behind him made him suddenly start:</p>
               <p>"Oh, Uncle Jimmy! Uncle Jimmy! do n't lock me in!" said the voice, and Mr. Paul
                  Effingham appeared from behind a desk in the corner where this worthy had
                  concealed himself.</p>
               <p>"You!" said Uncle Jimmy, holding up his hands, "you here, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, Uncle Jimmy. Was it wrong? I 'm a patriot, you know, and wanted to
                  hear," and Mr. Paul approached the pedagogue with a winning smile, bent upon
                  obtaining a full pardon.</p>
               <p>As for Uncle Jimmy, he gazed with austere surprise upon the youthful patriot, and
                  then, shaking his head—</p>
               <p>"Young man," he said, "what impelled you to this highly reprehensible course?
                  Young man, what did you do it for? More than one man and boy have hung for being
                  spies. What, sir, was your object?"</p>
               <p>"I 'm a patriot, you know, Uncle Jimmy," said the young spy, "and Jim Crow told me
                  you all were to meet here."</p>
               <p>"You were present all the time?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"And your parents! your parents! young man, who are now anxious about you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I often ride out in the evening, and it 's not late. You know, Uncle Jimmy, I
                  was bound to know every thing, I was. I 'm a patriot," and Mr. Paul assumed a
                  wheedling smile which made Uncle Jimmy turn aside his head and smile, too.</p>
               <p>"Young man," he said, turning again, with austere dignity, to Paul, "you have
                  acted with extraordinary freedom on this occasion. If I do not punish you, 't 'is
                  from regard for your worthy parents. Go, sir, and be home immediately; as for our
                  affairs, we can trust you, and let me never—"</p>
               <p>"Trust me, Uncle Jimmy!" cried Paul, raising his head; "I should say you can! I 'm
                  the captain of the Cornstalk regiment, sir—I am!" and Paul placed his hand upon
                  his left hip with great dignity.</p>
               <p>"Well, my child," said Uncle Jimmy, much mollified, "I doubt not 't is a patriotic
                  company. Go, now, and never repeat this indiscretion."</p>
               <p>"I 'm going right off. Shag's tied under an oak in the woods," said Paul; "but I
                  say, Uncle Jimmy."</p>
               <p>"Well, my boy?"</p>
               <p>"Is Banks' cross-roads the place of meeting?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, why do you ask?"</p>
               <p>"I just wanted to know," said Paul, mysteriously. "Good night, Uncle Jimmy. I 'm
                  very much obliged to you for the holiday to-morrow; we all are, and Blossom says
                  you 're very good."</p>
               <p>"<emph>She</emph> certainly is, Paul."</p>
               <pb n="424-425" xml:id="VAC6146-00000213"/>
               <p>"Yes, <emph>sir,</emph>" replied Paul, putting on his hat; "she 's a real patriot,
                  she is. Our union, Uncle Jimmy, will be a happy one, and you shall be invited. Now
                  good night, sir." With these words Mr. Paul bowed with dignity, and, with extreme
                  ceremony, disappeared.</p>
               <p>Uncle Jimmy looked after him for a moment, and then a smile diffused itself over
                  the old features.</p>
               <p>"Oh, he 's a proud one, is Paul," said Uncle Jimmy. "With what an air he touched
                  his little hat! how high he carried his head! how grand he walked! That boy would
                  march into the cannon's mouth, I think! I have never seen his equal."</p>
               <p>Having thus expressed his admiration, Uncle Jimmy locked the school house and
                  proceeded homeward. The forest was again silent, save for the hooting of a few
                  owls and the notes of the whippoorwill, and the moon soared aloft in triumph.</p>

               <head type="sub">GENERAL EFFINGHAM IS CARRIED OFF BY A CHARIOT.</head>
               <p>ON the morning after the nocturnal meeting, and about ten o'clock, a company of
                  youths, some twenty or thirty in number, were assembled in a glade of the forest,
                  not far from Banks' cross-roads.</p>
               <p>A huge oak stretched its wide arms over their heads, and a hamper, containing a
                  variety of eatables, was reposing on the mossy roots of the oak.</p>
               <p>It was the spot where in former times the <emph>old</emph> Cornstalk regiment had
                  paraded, and pic-niced—where the noble soldiers had been cheered by the presence
                  of the fair—where Mr. Crow gamboled—where the drum-head court martial had been
                  rapidly dispersed by the inspiriting notes of the Bowling Green banjo.</p>
               <p>That was a peaceful parade, however, and the only fatal weapons were the eyes of
                  Kate Effingham and her friends—the only victims, Master Willie, and his rival, Tom
                  Alston.</p>
               <p>But, since the good year of '65, many things had taken place, and now the great
                  Cornstalk regiment assembled anew, with far other designs than peaceful
                  festivals.</p>
               <p>Master Paul Effingham stood upon a stump and harangued his followers. His remarks
                  were to the effect that at last the day of liberty had dawned, that Virginians
                  would never be slaves, and to prevent this result he besought his associates to
                  enter into the war with vigor.</p>
               <p>A cheer greeted these observations, and the youthful followers of the young
                  patriot rallied round him, and declared that they were ready.</p>
               <p>They were of all ages under fifteen and above eight, and were armed with old guns,
                  which were far too heavy for them, and should have been left at home for their
                  fathers, from whom the weapons had been filched.</p>
               <p>Captain Effingham formed his men into a line, and then separated this line into
                  companies of three.</p>
               <p>Then the order was given to march—upon the hamper.</p>
               <p>The soldiers obeyed this order, acquiescing, apparently, in the opinion of their
                  chief, that before they joined the forces marching on Williamsburg, nature would
                  call for refreshment.</p>
               <p>Guns were therefore abandoned, hats cast on the ground, and the Cornstalk regiment
                  attacked the hamper with great valor.</p>
               <p>In fifteen minutes the basket was emptied, and turned with its top upon the
                  ground.</p>
               <p>Captain Effingham finished a bun with dignity, and ordered his men to their arms.
                  The ranks were immediately formed, Captain Effingham made another speech, and then
                  the noble regiment, full of ardor and patriotism, set forward, at a quick step,
                  toward Banks' cross-roads.</p>
               <p>But alas! for the designs of the patriots. They had just reached the highway, and
                  were marching in fine order,<pb n="426-427" xml:id="VAC6146-00000214"/> when a
                  chariot rolled toward them, and this chariot, when it reached a point just abreast
                  of them, suddenly paused.</p>
               <p>Captain Paul gave the order to present arms, which was obeyed with soldierly
                  precision.</p>
               <p>But alas!</p>
               <p>From the window of the chariot, a fair head was thrust, and Master Paul recognized
                  his mother.</p>
               <p>The young patriot's countenance fell, and his chin subsided on his breast.
                  Arrested, thus, in his march, the regiment trod upon his heels.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Paul!" said Madame Clare, "where in the world are you going?"</p>
               <p>"To fight the enemy, mamma," returned Paul, with a groan. "We are going to Banks'
                  cross-roads, the place of meeting."</p>
               <p>"Oh, my son, what an idea!" said his mother. "How could you?"</p>
               <p>"A patriot must do his duty, mamma," said Paul, ruefully.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my son," said his mother; "but you are much too young. You distress me very
                  much by these freaks, Paul! Come, now, and do not make me feel badly. Come into
                  the carriage, and go home, my son."</p>
               <p>It was long before Paul would consent to this, and more than one "noble tear," as
                  says the poet, bedewed his youthful eyes at his disappointment. Had the command
                  come from any other than his own mother, it is probable that Captain Paul would
                  have summoned his men to the rescue; but it was the voice of a beloved parent
                  which besought him; it was the wish of one to whom he had ever paid obedience
                  which arrested him. He turned a last look of agony on his soldiers, and
                  obeyed.</p>
               <p>"About, face! my friends," said Captain Paul, with dignity. "The commands of our
                  superiors must be obeyed. It is proper that, as your captain, I should set you the
                  example of obedience, and I must leave. Tom Jones, you can march the regiment
                  back," with which words Captain Paul slowly entered the carriage, and, we regret
                  to say, cried as it drove away.</p>
               <p>Once deprived of their noble and courageous—once left alone without him who was
                  the soul of their action—once paralyzed thus, and left desolate—the Cornstalk
                  regiment no longer aspired; they no longer had the heart to march forward; they
                  disbanded, broke into groups, and went off to play at something else than
                  "soldiering."</p>
               <p>The battle was not to have them in its tumult.</p>
               <p>I have paused thus, our worthy author says, on the very brink of great events to
                  relate this little comedy of the past. Why not? It is not only in the immense
                  events of history that the thoughtful mind looks to see the picture of the times.
                  The coloring of the bud is often brighter and more delicate than that of the
                  flower. What I aim at in my chronicle is a picture of the minds of men in old
                  days; the movements of boys even arrest and absorb me. What I 've told is a
                  veritable incident, and I think it is worthy of our notice. The child is the germ
                  of the man, and, just as the character of the seed determines the plant, so does
                  the character of the boy make the gray beard's. The children whom we have seen
                  thus ardently on their march were those who nursed the young republic in its
                  infancy—who braced their arms around it in the storm which came across the seas to
                  shake it. They stood around its cradle like a phalanx of steel-clad warriors, and
                  some of them fought for it at Yorktown. At sixteen, my friend Judge B——<ref
                     rend="super" target="#note_041" xml:id="return_041">*</ref> was captain of a
                  company; and almost before the beard of manhood decked his face, our noble
                  Washington was in charge of the whole border. The mind ripened quickly in those
                  days, and bloomed early; it was a noble, and chivalrous, and high nature which
                  thus filled the breasts of children. The roar of revolution made them old; they
                  were educated by Henry and Washington! For myself, there is nothing connected with
                  that period void of interest. I listen to <note place="foot" xml:id="note_041">
                     <p><ref target="#return_041">*</ref>The author here seems to refer to the late

                  <pb n="428-429" xml:id="VAC6146-00000215"/> the great voices in council; I listen
                  to the voices of the striplings, too. I see the great look on the stern brow of
                  the warrior; I see, also, the flush on the cheeks of the boys. In the great
                  panorama of the revolutionary story there is no figure unworthy of attention.<ref

               <head type="sub">THE MARCH OF THE HANOVERIANS ON WILLIAMSBURG.</head>
               <p>THE removal of the gunpowder from the magazine in Williamsburg sent a thrill of
                  indignation throughout Virginia.</p>
               <p>It was the last and crowning outrage—the keystone finishing the arch of
                  oppression—the final blow at those liberties which so long had been insidiously
                  attacked by Dunmore.</p>
               <p>In every county the inhabitants hastened to pass resolutions upon the outrage.
                  Many of these have been preserved—others lost, or not recorded; but what we have
                  are enough to show the spirit of the period.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>Amelia county,</emph> William Archer, chairman, resolved, first, on a
                  general muster of the militia; next, that each member of the committee should
                  provide "half a pound of gunpowder and one pound of lead, a stand of arms and
                  ammunition;" and John Tabb and Everard Meade were appointed to purchase "eight
                  hundred pounds of gunpowder and three thousand two hundred pounds of lead." Thus
                  Amelia alone furnished to the cause more powder than the magazine had contained
                  when it was robbed.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>New Kent county</emph> resolved that the removal of the powder was
                  "arbitrary," the governor's answer "evasive," that the rest of his lordship's
                  conduct proved him "an enemy of liberty and a zealous supporter of tyranny and
                  despotism over the people who had the unhappiness to live under his government."
                  To this was added a resolution to raise instantly a company.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>Gloucester county</emph> declared the reply of the governor "unsatisfactory,
                  disrespectful, and evasive," and offered twenty-five pounds sterling for three
                  hundred pounds of gunpowder manufactured in Virginia; fifty pounds sterling for
                  manufactures of woolen.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>King William county</emph> contributed one hundred and seventy-five pounds
                  to the suffering citizens of Massachusetts.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>Sussex county</emph> declared the removal of the powder "an act conceived in
                  secrecy and brought forth in darkness," and that the governor, by his action, had
                  "forfeited all title to the confidence of the good people of Virginia." The
                  members of the meeting promised to use every endeavor to enlist volunteers.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>Bedford county</emph> offered ten pounds sterling for twentyfive pounds of
                     <emph>sulphur.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <emph>Prince George county</emph> organized a committee of intelligence, whose
                  duty it was to communicate with other counties.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>Henrico county</emph> declared the removal of the powder "an insult to every
                  freeman in this county"—an action which they viewed with "detestation and
                  abhorrence."</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>Albemarle county</emph> spoke, in a letter, of the <emph>independent</emph>
                  company, to Colonel Washington:</p>
               <p>"The company of Independents," they said, "will attend in Williamsburg properly
                  equipped and prepared to enforce an immediate delivery of the powder, if not to be
                  obtained otherwise, or die in the attempt." The captain of the company signed his
                  name <emph>Charles Lewis.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>These old leaves of the past have been preserved for us; the action of the other
                  counties is lost. What it was we know perfectly, for the whole land was in arms,
                  and the Valley especially, on fire. <emph>Old Frederick,</emph> ever the
                     foremost<pb n="430-431" xml:id="VAC6146-00000216"/> most where the issue was
                  one of blood, became the rallying point for the companies of the West. For half a
                  century, nearly, the town of Winchester had been the heart of the West—the
                  sentinel of liberty—and Washington had lived there, sending from this center his
                  voice of good cheer to the whole border. It was now to be the rendezvous of men
                  bent on attacking another enemy than the savages—to send forth its blood as
                  before.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>Fredericksburg</emph> lastly took that action which has made her so
                  famous—surrounding her brows with a halo of glory. The men of Fredericksburg
                  declared that they were prepared to defend the liberties of Virginia, and of her
                  sister colonies, "at the utmost hazard of ourselves and our fortunes." And at the
                  bottom of this declaration was written in large letters, "GOD SAVE THE LIBERTIES
                  OF AMERICA!"</p>
               <p>A week after the removal of the powder, seven hundred men, completely equipped,
                  were assembled at Fredericksburg, ready to march upon the capital. Among these
                  were the "Culpepper Minute Men," in their green hunting shirts, hats crowned with
                  buck-tails, and belts stuck round with tomahawks and knives. On their breasts were
                  inscribed, in white letters, Henry's words, "LIBERTY OR DEATH;" and their banner
                  had for device, a coiled up rattlesnake, with the words "<emph>Do n't tread on
                     me!</emph>" beneath.</p>
               <p>Thus the whole State was fully aroused, and the East and West ready to march; when
                  a dispatch from Mr. Randolph of the council reached Fredericksburg.</p>
               <p>This letter declared that his Excellency had solemnly promised that the affair of
                  the powder should be fully accommodated.</p>
               <p>The deliberation of the volunteers, upon the reception of this letter, was long
                  and excited; and when the vote was taken, opinions were found to be nearly equally
                  divided. At first, the men were fixed in their original purpose; and the fourteen
                  companies of light horse, then encamped near at hand, were ardently expecting the
                  order to march. Peace counsels prevailed finally, however, by a single vote, and
                  expresses were sent off to Caroline, Frederick, Berkeley, Shenandoah, and other
                  counties, to inform them of the arrangement.</p>
               <p>The volunteers then dispersed, entering into a mutual pledge to be ready at a
                  moment's warning, whenever the standard was raised.</p>
               <p>That moment was not delayed.</p>
               <p>The troops separated on the 29th of April. On the 2d of May, Patrick Henry
                  summoned the Independent Company of Hanover, to meet him at New Castle, on the
                  Pamunkey, in the same county.</p>
               <p>Henry had seen, with bitter regret, the action of the troops on the reception of
                  the letter conveying the false promises of Dunmore—he had estimated those promises
                  at their just value—he saw with anguish that the moment when the whole land was
                  aroused, was likely to pass by unimproved.</p>
               <p>He, too, had hailed the affair of the powder as an invaluable blessing to the
                  cause in which his whole soul was wrapped. For ten years he had been endeavoring
                  to arouse Virginia to armed resistance, and thus, Dunmore in committing this
                  robbery, had coöperated with him, and aided him. But now this same man was about
                  to disarm, with a promise, those men whom he had armed by an outrage. A smile and
                  a promise which he never intended to keep, would delay the attack until an
                  overwhelming force was marched into Virginia.</p>
               <p>Henry had thus no sooner heard of the action at Fredericksburg, as we have said,
                  than he hastened to assemble the men of Hanover. To give more solemnity to his
                  act, he also convened the county committee which had just separated.</p>
               <p>They assembled in mass at his summons, and the orator addressed them with all the
                  powers of his wonderful eloquence. In his burning words, the fields of Concord
                     and<pb n="432-433" xml:id="VAC6146-00000217"/> Lexington rose vividly before
                  the auditors, floating in the blood of Americans; with passionate vehemence he
                  stripped from the ministerial designs their garb of concealment, of specious
                  promises and protestations, and showed them in all their deformity. He declared
                  that now or never—when this last outrage of Dunmore was still hot in the minds of
                  all—that now or never the blow must be struck. He ended by asking who would
                  accompany him to Williamsburg, to demand the restoration of the powder.</p>
               <p>"The meeting was in a flame," says the historian; "and Captain Samuel Meredith
                  resigning the command of the Independents, Henry was unanimously chosen their
                  leader, Captain Meredith taking the post of lieutenant."</p>
               <p>The company consisted of one hundred and fifty men, and at once commenced its
                  march for Williamsburg.</p>
               <p>Forty-eight hours afterward the news spread like wild-fire, and five thousand men
                  were on their way to join Henry.</p>
               <p>Let us not anticipate, however.</p>
               <p>A body of sixteen men, under command of Colonel Parke Goodall, ensign of the
                  "Independents," was detached across the river into the county of <emph>King and
                     Queen,</emph> to demand from the king's receiver-general, there residing, the
                  value of the powder, about three hundred pounds sterling.</p>
               <p>There is no reason to believe that Colonel Richard Corbin, the receiver-general,
                  was opposed to the cause of liberty. Doubtless, like many others, it so happened
                  that he held an office under the vice-regal government at this crisis, and hoped
                  for a peaceful redress of grievances.</p>
               <p>The orders to Colonel Goodall were to demand the value of the powder, and, if this
                  were refused, to take Colonel Corbin prisoner, and bring him "with all possible
                  respect and tenderness," to Doncastle's Ordinary, about sixteen miles above
                  Williamsburg.</p>
               <p>The detachment crossed the river on the same afternoon, about twilight, and
                  proceeded toward "Laneville" on the Matapony, the residence of the receiver, which
                  they reached nearly at midnight.</p>
               <p>Colonel Goodall, with that courtesy which characterized the men of his period,
                  determined not to arouse the family until daybreak, reflecting that this nocturnal
                  assault upon ladies in their beds would be exceedingly terrifying. He therefore
                  stationed guards around the dwelling, and calmly waited for the daylight.</p>
               <p>At daybreak, the ladies of the family appeared, not without terror at the sight of
                  the patrol, and to the courteous demand of the colonel, replied, that the receiver
                  was in Williamsburg. If this declaration was doubted, however, the house, they
                  said, was open to a search.</p>
               <p>Colonel Goodall replied courteously that such a proceeding was wholly unnecessary;
                  that Mrs. Corbin's assurance was enough. And then, without taking the proffered
                  refreshments, ordered his men to continue their way to the Ordinary, where they
                  were to join Henry.</p>
               <p>The main body had proceeded through Hanover, and a portion of New Kent, passing by
                  the church of St. Peter and the old Custis mansion, called the "White House,"
                  where Washington was married, and ever increasing as they rolled on like a flood,
                  had reached finally Doncastle's Ordinary.</p>
               <p>Here at this tavern, which was also in New Kent, near the boundaries of James
                  City, Colonel Goodall joined his chief; and here the company halted to refresh
                  themselves.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE MEETING AT DONCASTLE'S ORDINARY.</head>
               <p>AT the moment when Colonel Patrick Henry arrived with his troop in front of
                  Doncastle's Ordinary, the company commanded by Captain John Hamilton made their
                  appearance, at full gallop, coming to meet them.</p>
               <pb n="434-435" xml:id="VAC6146-00000218"/>
               <p>In a few moments the two troops had dismounted—a host of negroes ran to bait their
                  weary horses—and the men of Colonel Henry and Captain Hamilton, respectively,
                  proceeded to fraternize and exchange congratulations.</p>
               <p>Our friend Captain Waters and Colonel Henry seemed to be old acquaintances. They
                  exchanged a hearty greeting, and the captain seemed in high spirits.</p>
               <p>"The sight of you is really good for sore eyes, my dear colonel," he said;
                     "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">morbleu!</foreign> I think the cards at last shuffled
                  and dealt! What 's the number of your men?"</p>
               <p>"About two hundred only, captain," said Colonel Henry, drawing round him his
                  inseparable old red cloak; "but five thousand I 'm told are marching to join
                  us."</p>
               <p>"Five thousand! why, an army! a host! With that many, my dear friend, we will blow
                  his Excellency sky high."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I think we could drive him away."</p>
               <p>"'Could!' What do you mean, colonel?"</p>
               <p>"'Will,' then,—if—if—unfortunately"—</p>
               <p>"If?" said the captain anxiously. "I 'm afraid of that little word
                     '<emph>if,</emph>' friend."</p>
               <p>"So am I, captain."</p>
               <p>"What does it mean in your mouth, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami?</foreign>
                  speak!"</p>
               <p>"Well, I meant to say that the result of our march would probably be the rout of
                  his Excellency and his adherents—<emph>if</emph> he does not defeat
                     <emph>us</emph> by paying for the powder."</p>
               <p>And Colonel Henry's face assumed its old grim smile as he spoke.</p>
               <p>"Paying," cried Captain Waters, "paying for the powder!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, captain."</p>
               <p>"Why, that would be dishonest! it would be illegal, my dear colonel!" cried his
                  companion. "Here this fellow Dunmore first robs us of our property and then has
                  the audacity to offer us the value of the stolen goods! You can't think of
                  accepting such an offer!"</p>
               <p>"I fear I must."</p>
               <p>"Must! why?"</p>
               <p>"The colony would not sustain me in refusing. I should simply be deposed from my
                  command, and the only result would be that some one else's signature would be
                  appended to the receipt. I 'm not a free agent, captain. Colonel Carter Braxton
                  left me, some hours since, for Williamsburg, and I promised to wait a certain time
                  for him to go and return; you know, Colonel Corbin, the receiver, is his relative.
                  Now he 'll come, I predict, and bring the money."</p>
               <p>The captain's head drooped.</p>
               <p>"What you say, my friend," he muttered, mournfully, "has caused me the very
                  keenest anguish. It seems to me that the result will be the escape of the wolf,
                  just when the chase is in full burst!"</p>
               <p>"Exactly, captain."</p>
               <p>The captain remained thoughtful for a moment and sighed. He seemed really
                  overcome.</p>
               <p>"And so your parole is given to Colonel Braxton, is it?" he said.</p>
               <p>"Yes; but in less than an hour I shall be released."</p>
               <p>"Released?"</p>
               <p>"The time fixed for his return will expire then, captain. If he did not bring the
                  money then, I told him, I should march."</p>
               <p>"You would march?"</p>
               <p>"Undoubtedly."</p>
               <p>"And in less than an hour."</p>
               <p>The colonel nodded.</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Morbleu!</foreign>" cried the captain, "you delight me,
                  my dear colonel! Then I 'll have my good bout with Foy yet."</p>
               <p>"With Foy?"</p>
               <p>"With Mr. <emph>Secretary</emph> Foy. You see, my dear friend, 't is a little
                  arrangement between us that, at the first open hostilities, our swords shall
                  cross. I 'm positively sick for the encounter, and now, since you assure me that
                     you<pb n="436-437" xml:id="VAC6146-00000219"/> march in an hour, I think the
                  chances are favorable for the bout!"</p>
               <p>Colonel Henry shook his head dubiously.</p>
               <p>"I have a presentiment, captain," he said, "that Colonel Braxton will return in
                  time. He said the money would be paid, and he 'd only to go for it, and you know
                  he 's a man of his word."</p>
               <p>As these words were uttered in a melancholy tone, an expression of deep
                  disappointment came to the captain's face.</p>
               <p>"He 'll return with the money."</p>
               <p>"I 'm sure of it."</p>
               <p>"Then all 's lost!" and the captain let his chin fall on his breast. He remained
                  motionless and frowning for some moments; but suddenly his frown disappeared, his
                  head rose:</p>
               <p>"My dear colonel," he cried, "you made Colonel Braxton a promise; will you make me
                  one, too?"</p>
               <p>"A promise? What is it?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, 't is nothing unreasonable, my small request. <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >Morbleu!</foreign> 't is most fair."</p>
               <p>"Speak, captain."</p>
               <p>"Do you wish valid payment for the powder if you are compelled to receive
                  payment?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, sir."</p>
               <p>"Then promise me that you 'll only receive gold or Bank of England notes—no
                  promises of payment of any description from either his Excellency, or the
                  receiver, or Colonel Braxton."</p>
               <p>Colonel Henry reflected, and the captain watched the expression of his countenance
                  with the deepest anxiety.</p>
               <p>"Well," said the colonel, "I see no objection to promising that, and I certainly
                  shall refuse any promissory notes."</p>
               <p>"Good!" cried the captain; "and now, my dear colonel, I will not further intrude
                  on you. I see my friends Hamilton and Effingham yonder coming to talk with
                  you."</p>
               <p>So speaking, the captain made the military salute, sauntered easily away, and went
                  out of the Ordinary.</p>
               <p>He had no sooner reached the spot where his horse was tied, however, than, leaping
                  into the saddle, he set forward, at full speed, on the road to Williamsburg.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER LXXXI.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE ROBBERY OF THE COACH OF THE KING'S RECEIVER-GENERAL.</head>
               <p>JUST an hour before the interview which we have just related, a chariot, drawn by
                  four fresh horses, and driven at full speed, left Williamsburg by the road leading
                  to New Kent.</p>
               <p>The speed of the coach, great as it was, however, did not seem to keep pace with
                  the feelings of its inmate.</p>
               <p>The head of a gentleman about forty years of age, wearing a long flaxen peruke and
                  ample cocked hat, was thrust from the window, and this head uttered, in an
                  impatient and hurried voice, the words,</p>
               <p>"Faster! faster! make the horses gallop!"</p>
               <p>The driver obeyed and laid his long lash on the backs of the horses.</p>
               <p>They started forward, at a gallop, and the coach whirled along through the fields
                  and into the forest with fearful rapidity.</p>
               <p>At the end of half an hour the speed of the horses began to abate, their strength
                  to flag. The coach then proceeded at a more moderate pace, apparently causing the
                  gentleman within great impatience.</p>
               <p>He took from his pocket some papers, however, and examined them carefully. Then he
                  opened a large pocket book of leather, and counted some notes of the Bank of
                  England.</p>
               <pb n="438-439" xml:id="VAC6146-00000220"/>
               <p>As he did so, he heard, or thought he heard, the rapid foot-falls of a horse
                  behind the carriage.</p>
               <p>He thrust his head from the window, and at the same moment descried a horseman who
                  rushed rapidly toward him, and drew rein beside the window.</p>
               <p>The chariot was descending a gorge in the forest at the moment, and had moderated
                  still further its headlong speed.</p>
               <p>The stranger drew rein, and leaning one hand on the edge of the window, said,</p>
               <p>"Have I the honor to speak to Colonel Braxton?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said the occupant of the chariot; "your business, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Order the coach to stop, colonel."</p>
               <p>"Impossible, sir; I am on urgent public business, and can not tarry for a
                  moment."</p>
               <p>"Still it 's necessary, my dear colonel," said the enemy; "give the order."</p>
               <p>"I 'll do nothing of the sort, sir!" cried the other; "drive faster!"</p>
               <p>These latter words were directed to the coachman, who raised his whip to strike
                  the horses.</p>
               <p>Before it descended the cavalier had rushed on his swift horse to the head of the
                  animals, and catching the leaders by the bridle, made them rear and start
                  sidewise.</p>
               <p>He was immediately at the coach window again, and said, coolly,</p>
               <p>"Now, your money, my dear colonel."</p>
               <p>"My money sir! are you mad?" cried Colonel Braxton, in a fury.</p>
               <p>"No, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">morbleu!</foreign>" cried the enemy, "I 'm perfectly
                  sane! I repeat that I want your money, my dear friend—not your money or your life,
                  as the highwaymen say—but the sum which you bear from his Excellency!"</p>
               <p>"You are insane!" cried the colonel, shouting to the driver to lash his horses;
                  "you shall repent this outrage, sir! begone!"</p>
               <p>The horses again darted forward, but the cavalier kept his place at the carriage
                  window.</p>
               <p>"For the last time, your money, friend!" he said; "<foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >morbleu,</foreign> I shall not ask you again."</p>
               <p>"You intend to rob me, then?"</p>
               <p>"Precisely."</p>
               <p>With a movement as rapid as lightning, Colonel Braxton thrust his hand into the
                  pocket of the coach and drew forth a pistol.</p>
               <p>He leveled the weapon at his enemy and discharged it, the bullet passing through
                  the lappel of the horseman's surtout.</p>
               <p>"Ah! well!" cried that gentleman, "you 'll do battle, will you, friend? But first
                  I 'll secure what I want."</p>
               <p>With these words the speaker suddenly extended his hand through the window of the
                  coach, and caught from the other 's grasp the three or four hundred pound notes
                  which he held.</p>
               <p>"Now friend," he said, "this will suffice! I had some compunctions about
                  proceeding so irregularly, but you 've attempted my life, and I 'm quite easy! Do
                  n't discharge another pistol at me as I go, or I' ll imitate you. I have two in my
                  holsters, and perhaps I shall blow out your brains!"</p>
               <p>With these words the speaker put spur to his horse, and striking the coach horse,
                  as he passed, disappeared in the forest.</p>
               <p>With a face full of rage and amazement, Colonel Braxton was borne onward, asking
                  himself if he had dreamed this outrage—if he really could be awake.</p>
               <p>"Well," he growled, "'t is far more important to arrive yonder in time, and I can
                  easily give my note for the money. Lash your horses!"</p>
               <p>And in obedience to his order the driver again struck his animals, which rapidly
                  bore the vehicle to the Ordinary.</p>
               <p>The Hanover company and the rest were drawn up before the door, and Colonel Henry
                  was just issuing forth to get<pb n="440-441" xml:id="VAC6146-00000221"/> into the
                  saddle. He paused, however, as the chariot flashed up.</p>
               <p>"Ah! is that you, colonel?" he said; "you have come at last."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Colonel Braxton, getting out of the chariot and exchanging a grasp of
                  the hand with Henry, "I have come, on the part of his lordship, to pay for the
                  powder."</p>
               <p>"To pay!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, its full value."</p>
               <p>A grim smile came to the face of Colonel Henry, and he hesitated, looking at his
                  men. With a deep sigh he seemed to decide.</p>
               <p>"I am told we 'll have an army of five thousand men tomorrow," he said; "still I
                  promised to take the money, and I must take it."</p>
               <p>With these words Colonel Henry walked into the Ordinary, followed by Colonel
                  Braxton.</p>
               <p>"Pen and ink, landlord," he said; "of course I shall give a receipt."</p>
               <p>"I must first premise that I was robbed on the route hither," said Colonel
                  Braxton. And he related the scene on the road to Henry. Some of the company, who
                  were in the room, laughed heartily, and the same grim smile reappeared on the face
                  of Henry.</p>
               <p>"In truth, he must have been a madman," he replied, "and what you have said,
                  colonel, materially alters the face of affairs."</p>
               <p>With these words Colonel Henry laid down his pen.</p>
               <p>"Alters affairs?" asked the other; "how is that?"</p>
               <p>"Why, unfortunately, I gave a promise no later than half an hour ago, that I would
                  take only gold or bank bills in payment. 'T is unfortunate, my dear colonel, but
                  the promise is given."</p>
               <p>"To whom—Heaven preserve us!" cried Colonel Braxton, in despair.</p>
               <p>"To a friend—Captain Waters by name."</p>
               <p>"Tall—with a black moustache—riding a black Arabian?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is an accurate description of him."</p>
               <p>"Why, he it was who robbed me!"</p>
               <p>"Possible!" said Colonel Henry, with his former grim smile; "why, my dear colonel,
                  he is a gentleman of large landed estate, and I have always heard that he was
                  honest."</p>
               <p>"I say 't was he!"</p>
               <p>"Captain Waters?"</p>
               <p>"Yes! Colonel Henry. 'T is a deep-laid conspiracy, and the object of this
                  gentleman was plainly to paralyze me."</p>
               <p>"If so, it was very reprehensible in the captain."</p>
               <p>And the same sardonic smile wreathed the corners of the iron mouth of Henry.</p>
               <p>"Of course you will not suffer the affair to affect your action."</p>
               <p>"Unfortunately I 've promised to take gold or notes only, colonel. I am the
                  veriest slave of my word."</p>
               <p>"You then refuse my own obligation for the powder?"</p>
               <p>"I must—perforce."</p>
               <p>Colonel Braxton bit his lip, and looked both anxious and irritated. But the
                  expression of pain and regret predominated.</p>
               <p>"Of course, sir," he said, "I am not so discourteous as to intimate you had any
                  part in this. Your action, however, supports Captain Waters' outrage, and the
                  result will be blood."</p>
               <p>"It is unfortunate," said Henry, with the same iron calmness, and buckling on his
                  sword.</p>
               <p>Colonel Braxton knit his brows in anguish, and remained thus silent and gloomy for
                  some moments.</p>
               <p>Then his countenance was suddenly illumined with joy, and he hastened to his
                  chariot, and immediately returned with a small leather portmanteau.</p>
               <p>From this portmanteau he drew a roll of bank notes.</p>
               <p>"It is most fortunate, colonel," he said to Henry, "that the events of the last
                  few days have caused me so much concern. I brought this money to Williamsburg to
                  make a payment on my own private account, and such was my preoccupation<pb
                     n="442-443" xml:id="VAC6146-00000222"/> occupation that I quite forgot it until
                  this moment. I now offer you, on the part of his Excellency, three hundred and
                  thirty pounds in Bank of England notes, in payment for the powder. There,
                  colonel."</p>
               <p>And he laid the notes on the table.</p>
               <p>Colonel Henry thereupon sat down, and spreading a large sheet of paper before him,
                  wrote the following receipt:</p>

                              from the Hon. Richard Corbin, Esq., his Majesty's Receiver-General,
                                 330<abbr>l.,</abbr> as a compensation for the gunpowder lately

                              I promise to convey to the Virginia delegates at the general congress,
                              to be, under their direction, laid out in gunpowder for the colony's

               <p>Colonel Henry had scarcely affixed his signature to this paper, when the
                  hoof-strokes of a horse resounded on the road before the tavern, and the next
                  moment Captain Waters entered the apartment, his spurs jingling and his lips
                  smiling.</p>
               <p>At sight of the money, however, and the receipt which Colonel Braxton raised from
                  the table and folded, this expression suddenly changed.</p>
               <p>"The money's paid!" he cried; "you do n't say the powder is paid for, my
                  friends!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said Colonel Braxton, with an angry flush; "and your outrage has
                  failed—your robbery, sir"</p>
               <p>The captain was so much overwhelmed by this failure of his scheme that he scarcely
                  heard the angry words addressed to him.</p>
               <p>His head drooped, his hands fell at his side, and from his lips escaped the
                  sorrowful words,</p>
               <p>"Then Foy and myself will not meet!"</p>
               <p>The captain sighed, and looked around mournfully.</p>
               <p>"Ah! well!" he said at length, "I 'll not be cast down! What 's not to-day may be
                  to-morrow! Let us wait!"</p>
               <p>Then turning to Colonel Braxton, the captain took from his pocket the four hundred
                  pound notes and returned them.</p>
               <p>"You will pardon my little jest, my dear colonel," he said, "as I freely pardon
                  you the pistol shot which passed, you see, close to my breast, spoiling my best
                  coat—my best, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">parole d'honneur!</foreign> It was only a
                  little escapade of fun, an ebullition of youthful spirits. I 'm getting old and I
                  need amusement. My object was simply to further a small private affair, which the
                  march of our friends here upon Williamsburg would have suited admirably. I thought
                  I had provided for every thing—well! well! The best schemes sometimes fail—the
                  most honest intentions! I suppose now the chance of war 's at an end—what
                  unhappiness!"</p>
               <p>And the captain sighed in the midst of laughter.</p>
               <p>Even Colonel Braxton, who was excellently pleased with the result, joined in the
                  laughter, and one would have thought that these men were in a ball room, instead
                  of on the surface of a volcano.<ref rend="super" target="#note_043"

               <p>"So the affair is all over, and the fight will not take place," said Captain
                  Waters to Colonel Henry, as he got into the saddle.</p>
               <p>A grim smile wreathed the firm iron lips, and the man of the red cloak
                  replied,</p>
               <p>"Let us wait; 't is the momentary ebb of the wave, friend!"</p>
               <p>"The ebb?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; the silence in the air—the lull before the storm—<pb n="444-445"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000223"/> the retrograde movement of the great wave of
                  revolution. When that wave rushes forward again, as it will before you can speak,
                  almost, it will strike and overwhelm! Then you 'll see the last scene of the last
                  act of the tragedy—the tragedy of 'George III. in Virginia!' Farewell!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER LXXXII.</head>
               <head type="sub">HOW LINDON LEFT WILLIAMSBURG, AND WHOM HE CONVERSED WITH AT
                  AGINCOURT.</head>
               <p>THE prophecy was destined soon to be fulfilled. Dunmore vainly thought that
                  compliance with the demands of the Hanoverians, in the matter of the powder, would
                  quiet the colony and disarm revolution.</p>
               <p>Things had gone too far; the times were ripe now, and nothing could divert the
                  storm about to burst. The Assembly was summoned, the Governor made a diplomatic
                  speech, with Lord North's famous "olive branch" proposal in his hand, but it was
                  all of no avail.</p>
               <p>Virginia was aroused in its whole length and breadth, and arms were in every hand,
                  soon, as we shall see, to be used.</p>
               <p>Let us proceed, however, to relate the events which befell the personages of our
                  narrative, before we chronicle the outburst of the storm. For, after all, it is a
                  family history which we relate—the joys and sorrows of unhistorical personages is
                  our chief subject.</p>
               <p>Let us follow now the events which brought all things to an issue here too; like
                  the whole land, our small domain had its convulsion and its tragedy, and this we
                  shall now proceed to relate.</p>
               <p>About three weeks after the scene which we have just witnessed at Doncastle's
                  Ordinary, Lindon one morning presented himself before Lord Dunmore, and requested
                  leave of absence for a fortnight.</p>
               <p>This leave was graciously accorded by his lordship, who thought he would have at
                  present no use for his mercenaries; and on the same afternoon, Lindon mounted his
                  horse, and crossing the James at Burwell's ferry, set forward in a south-westerly
                  direction over the main road of Isle of Wight county.</p>
               <p>Busy with the events befalling our chief characters, we have not been able to
                  expend, upon this gentleman and his affairs, that attention, which, in view of
                  their connection with our history, they demand at our hands.</p>
               <p>Lindon had, time after time, renewed his addresses to Bonnybel, and repulse seemed
                  only to arouse still more deeply the profound passion of his nature. Driven back
                  upon every occasion—rejected time after time, and always with increased coldness
                  and decision by the girl—he had come at last to regard it as a single combat
                  between them for the victory, and in the depths of his heart he registered a
                  silent oath that he would conquer the girl's resolution or die in the attempt.
                  There was still another reason in addition, which impelled him to persevere.</p>
               <p>The large property which he inherited from his father, had, by successive
                  mortgages, been almost wholly alienated; and such had been the success of the
                  owner, that his affairs were now hopelessly embarrassed. To preserve his station,
                  and not be turned as a beggar on the world, it was necessary that he should look
                  around him speedily for some means of fortifying his position; and this he found
                  in a marriage with Bonnybel. Were he to secure the hand of that young lady, the
                  wealth and influence of Colonel Vane would be at his command; and he could easily
                  induce his creditors to delay the threatened sale of all his property. They had
                  already forced him to sell nearly every servant which he possessed; and he was
                  scarcely left now with a handful. A union with Bonnybel was thus equally desirable
                  in a business point of view; and with passion and cupidity working together, the
                  whole energies of this man's nature were put forth to attain his object.</p>
               <pb n="446-447" xml:id="VAC6146-00000224"/>
               <p>Let us follow him, and see whither he goes.</p>
               <p>About sunset, Lindon reached his house of "Agincourt," which was a fine old
                  mansion, erected upon a lofty hill; and as he rode up, the dying sunset gilded the
                  roofs and the many out-houses attached to the homestead.</p>
               <p>With an air of fiery impatience which had become habitual with him of late, he
                  threw the bridle of his horse to a rough-looking man, and said briefly:</p>
               <p>"You have watched carefully, as I ordered you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes sir," replied the man, doffing his cap; "she has been rather more restive
                  to-day, and I had some trouble, as usual; but I think she sees there 's no
                  hope."</p>
               <p>"That 's well," said Lindon; "now order some dinner for me, I 'm nearly broken
                  down. Go!"</p>
               <p>The man touched his forehead, and Lindon entered the house.</p>
               <p>It was elegantly arranged, and the furniture of the great apartment which he
                  entered, though rather too gaudy for good taste, displayed every mark of
                  wealth.</p>
               <p>Lindon threw himself upon a velvet sofa, and ringing for wine, which a servant
                  brought him upon a silver waiter, took great gulps of the liquid, and then seemed
                  to reflect.</p>
               <p>"Things are coming to a crisis," he muttered at length; "and if I act at all, I
                  must act quickly. Those scoundrels will sell me out, if I do not prevent them; and
                  there 's but one way now—this marriage! How can I achieve it? How conquer that
                  diabolical resolution of a mere love-sick girl, dreaming, I have no doubt, of that
                  pale-faced hero, for-sooth! She loves him, and she scorns me! Curse him! he 's the
                  stumbling-block in all my schemes, and eternally opposes and conquers me! Why did
                  n't I run him through the heart yonder, and so end him? Shall I now? He is still
                  weak from his sickness, and I could do it! I 'll think about it!"</p>
               <p>And with a heavy frown upon his brow, Lindon was silent for some moments,
                  reflecting.</p>
               <p>"No!" he growled, at length, with an oath; "no! curse him! I 'd like to put an end
                  to his scheming; but what good would that do? It would only make the marriage more
                  difficult, and I 've no time to attend to such things. In a fortnight, perhaps,
                  Dunmore will be driven from Virginia, and I was a fool to attach myself to such a
                  coward as he is! I thought he would bolster me up, but he can't protect himself
                  from these <foreign xml:lang="FRA">canaille!</foreign> This fine hero, St. John,
                  this Lord Bolingbroke! well, he shall escape me for the present, though I shall
                  not forget him. I must think of something more important."</p>
               <p>He was interrupted by the summons to the table, whither he proceeded and rapidly
                  devoured his meal, washing it down with large draughts of wine. He then returned
                  to the sofa, and, with knit brows, again reflected:</p>
               <p>"Well, I 'm determined, at last!" he said, with a face flushed by the thought in
                  his mind more than by the wine which he had drunk; "it is the only way that 's
                  left to me, and I 'll do it and take the consequences! Now I 'll go and see
                  madame," with which words he rose, with a sinister smile, from the sofa, and left
                  the room.</p>
               <p>He ascended the great stair-case, and, taking a key from his pocket, opened a room
                  directly over the one he had just left.</p>
               <p>It was a chamber elegantly furnished, and, in a corner, sat—Miss Carne, the Vanely
                  seamstress.</p>
               <p>The woman sat crouched down and leaned her elbows on her knees. Her hair, falling
                  in disordered masses on her bosom, completely concealed her countenance—the brows
                  resting upon her white and nervous hands.</p>
               <p>As Lindon entered she half raised her head, and, when she saw who her visitor was,
                  raised it entirely erect.</p>
               <p>The face thus revealed was scarcely recognizable. Formerly, this woman had been
                  almost beautiful, and an expression of tranquillity and content characterized her
                  entire appearance. Now, however, all this had disappeared. Her face was haggard
                  and furrowed by passion, and her dark<pb n="448-449" xml:id="VAC6146-00000225"/>
                  eyes burned with a sullen and lurid flame which seemed to flash up and glitter as
                  she looked upon Lindon.</p>
               <p>He entered with a sarcastic smile, and, approaching the woman, said,
                  satirically,</p>
               <p>"How is my pretty bird to-day—how is madame the vulture? Have my people supplied
                  all her wants and complied with her wishes?"</p>
               <p>A lurid flash, brighter than the former, darted from the eyes of Miss Carne.</p>
               <p>"Madame seems silent," said Lindon in the same tone of sarcasm.</p>
               <p>There was no reply.</p>
               <p>With cheeks flushed with wine, and a gait unsteady from the same cause, Lindon
                  drew nearer to the woman, and, at last, placed one hand carelessly on her
                  head.</p>
               <p>Before he could complete the caress which he attempted, the woman rose to her
                  feet, with a spring like a wild cat, and uttered a hoarse cry which was scarcely
                  human.</p>
               <p>"Do n't touch me!" she said. "Touch me at you peril!" and, with bloodshot eyes,
                  hair hanging in disorder, and lips writhing with convulsive passion, she seemed
                  ready to spring upon Lindon and throttle him.</p>
               <p>"Ah! our pretty hawk is angry," he said, with a sarcastic grin; "our lady bird
                  intends to show her claws. Come to its deary—deary won't let anybody hurt his
                  turtle-dove," and again he attempted to touch her hair.</p>
               <p>With one bound the woman sprang to a table upon which a knife had been left, and,
                  clutching it, confronted her persecutor.</p>
               <p>Lindon regarded her, for a moment, with drunken gravity, and then said,
                  soothingly,</p>
               <p>"Come, do n't let us have any scenes."</p>
               <p>"I wish to have none!" said the woman, hoarsely, "but before you shall touch me I
                  will plunge this knife into your heart. I hate you! I detest you! The very sight
                  of you makes me sick!"</p>
               <p>"Ah! does it?" said Lindon, approaching her cautiously but with apparent
                  carelessness.</p>
               <p>"Yes! you tempted me to crime! you took advantage of my treacherous nature! you
                  made me the tool of your villainy by appealing to my avarice, and now—"</p>
               <p>"You 've not even the consolation of the reward, eh?" said Lindon, satirically;
                  "is that your meaning?" and, with the same air of carelessness, he approached
                  nearer still.</p>
               <p>"Yes!" said the woman, hoarsely; "you made a devil of me, and now you turn me
                  loose without the money for which I sold myself!"</p>
               <p>"Turned you loose, my pretty bud? Is n't that a slight mistake?"</p>
               <p>And he drew nearer still.</p>
               <p>"Yes!" said the woman, with sullen passion, "you are right! I am not free; I am a
                  prisoner here under a brutal jailor."</p>
               <p>"And can't go and tell the world of my depravity, eh?"</p>
               <p>"It shall know all yet, and you will be punished! If the world does not do it I
                  will!"</p>
               <p>And an angry clutch of the knife showed the meaning of the speaker.</p>
               <p>"Ah? You will?"</p>
               <p>"Yes!"</p>
               <p>"You will punish me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes!"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps stab me?"</p>
               <p>"If you tempt me!"</p>
               <p>"Well, I will!"</p>
               <p>And Lindon, who had approached nearer and nearer as he uttered these words,
                  suddenly sprang upon the woman, and wrenching the knife from her grasp, broke the
                  blade by striking it on the table.</p>
               <p>He then confined the wrists of the furious woman in his own, and forcing her
                  writhing form violently into a chair, said,</p>
               <pb n="450-451" xml:id="VAC6146-00000226"/>
               <p>"Now, my pretty lady-bird, I 've blunted your claws! In future you had better
                  watch better!"</p>
               <p>He continued to hold her thus until she ceased struggling, and then finding her
                  apparently subdued, released his hold.</p>
               <p>"My dear Madame Carne, or Madame In-What-Ever-Other-Name-Thou-Rejoicest," he said,
                  "you perceive that after all I am more than a match for you in deviltry. It is
                  true I never could have accomplished what you did, and there I accord you every
                  praise. Your boldness and treachery and cunning were admirable, and extort my
                  highest admiration. You effected your object, and I confess that the thousand
                  pound note which I promised you ought to have been forthcoming. You know it became
                  absolutely necessary to confine you here afterwards, and here you will still
                  remain until I 've finished a little affair which I may as well tell you of as a
                  friend. You can not report it, fortunately, and I 'm <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >ennuyé</foreign> this evening. Come, I 'll sit here and tell you all about
                  it!"</p>
               <p>With these words Lindon coolly sat down opposite to Miss Carne, upon whose
                  countenance the sullen and lurid look had taken the place of the fiery passion,
                  and thus, reposing gracefully, her persecutor spoke at length upon the "little
                  affair."</p>
               <p>At ten o'clock he rose, and said,</p>
               <p>"I think the thing looks promising; do n't you? You know the old adage, 'faint
                  heart never won a fair lady yet,' and I need not tell so intimate a friend as
                  yourself—one so well acquainted with my private affairs—that 't is absolutely
                  necessary for me to take some acred young lady to wife. I am determined to have
                  this one, and I 've told you the means I shall employ. Of course your thousand
                  pounds will be punctually paid, and I shall escort you gallantly to the seaboard,
                  and see you depart. I trust 't will so end; but perhaps you will not permit it. I
                  see a gleam in your fair eyes which may make it necessary to suppress you. Do you
                  know the meaning of that word? I 've a fellow here who has an original genius for
                  murder; of course, however, I shall not employ him. You won't be revengeful, dear
                  ladybird, but profit by the thing and go away."</p>
               <p>Having thus spoken in the same tone of mocking sarcasm, Lindon yawned and declared
                  his intention to retire.</p>
               <p>The woman did not reply. Still crouching in her seat, and looking at him fixedly
                  with her bloodshot eyes, she resembled a panther about to spring.</p>
               <p>Lindon rose and made her a low, mock, ceremonious bow.</p>
               <p>"I trust your ladyship will have pleasant dreams," he said, "and I now have the
                  honor of respectfully bidding you adieu."</p>
               <p>As he closed the door and disappeared, the woman rose to her feet, and with an
                  indescribable expression of hatred, looked at the spot where he had passed from
                  her sight.</p>
               <p>At the same moment the key turned, the heavy bolt was shot into its place, and
                  Lindon retreated, singing in a harsh and drunken voice, a bacchanalian song.</p>
               <p>The woman shook her clenched fist at the door, and with lips convulsed by passion,
                  muttered hoarsely,</p>
               <p>"You said I was cunning—wait and see!"</p>
               <p>And her sinister eyes betrayed the fixed resolution which she had made.</p>

               <head type="sub">A GLANCE AT VANELY.</head>
               <p>AT Vanely, as of old, sleeps the beautiful sunshine of the tender May, and the
                  flowers bloom as they did on that morning of '74 when we opened the pages of our
                  chronicle.</p>
               <p>Again, as on that morn when Tom Alston and his friend rode gayly up the hill, the
                  leaves bourgeon and bloom—the winds laugh and dance onward as though singing,
                  while the great oaks rustle, the clouds float like white strips on an<pb
                     n="452-453" xml:id="VAC6146-00000227"/> ocean of azure, and the grass on the
                  lawn is sprinkled with forget-me-nots, those stars of the earth in the spring.</p>
               <p>That spring, as in old years, has come in rejoicing, and the domain of Vanely
                  wakes up and smiles, and puts on the gala costume of the fine season.</p>
               <p>Let us enter, for a moment, as we pass onward, and look around us.</p>
               <p>In his old chair, in the library with its oaken book-cases and table covered with
                  volumes, sits our friend the good colonel, with his gouty foot raised upon a
                  cricket. He reads, stopping at times to polish his spectacles, for the old
                  gentleman finds age creeping on him.</p>
               <p>By his side sits Bonnybel, engaged at some work, with a sad smile on her fair
                  face, which is still paler than before. But this paleness even adds to her beauty.
                  She looks more like a sweet phantom than a woman of flesh and blood, and, when she
                  raises her large violet eyes and smiles, her whole countenance is so spiritual
                  that an old painter might have taken it for a type of Madonna.</p>
               <p>Long hours pass thus, and then Mrs. Vane, Miss Seraphina and Helen come in, and
                  the family converse and try to cheer the girl. They evidently affect the merriment
                  of spirit which they display, and it is meant to enliven <emph>her.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>The father and daughter sit thus in the cheerful room every morning, and here
                  Bonnybel receives her visitors. These visitors are Barry Hunter, Mr. Page, Mr.
                  Ranton and others, and often Tom Alston and Jack Hamilton come to Vanely, though
                  the former has, for some time now, been sick.</p>
               <p>Miss Seraphina rather likes to be teased about Mr. Hamilton, and the color in
                  Helen's cheek, when Mr. Alston is mentioned, seems to indicate that the fruit has
                  nearly fallen by the "shaking."</p>
               <p>At times, Bonnybel goes to the harpsichord and sings, and her voice has the old
                  tenderness and sweetness, but not the joy. That contagious freshness and merriment
                  which once characterized it is gone, and it has a sad music in its faint carol. It
                  is "Katherine Ogie" which she sings most frequently, and the ditty is so
                  inexpressibly sad and touching as she sings it, that tears more than once come to
                  the eyes of the auditors.</p>
               <p>Thus the days pass on, and the current flows tranquilly in the good old mansion
                  from which we have been absent so long. Political events make small stir there,
                  though they are spoken of frequently, and often the old colonel suppresses an
                  outbreak. He does not yield now to these passionate impulses. He grows old.</p>
               <p>One subject alone is never mentioned—one name is never uttered. But she thinks of
                  him always.</p>
               <p>What befell that personage, and, especially, what happened to the girl, the two
                  letters, which we now lay before the reader, and the events which followed, will
                  abundantly show.</p>
               <p>The crisis of the family history and the political storm ripened and rushed into
                  action nearly at the same moment.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>"HOW long it seems now since I 've written to my own dear Kate! I received,
                     more than three weeks since, your kind, sweet letter, and only my unhappiness
                     has prevented me from replying. You may not consider this a good reason, but it
                     is true. When we suffer little sorrows, and are sad only, then we fly to our
                     friends and unbosom ourselves, and the act brings us consolation. This is not
                     the case, I think, when we are deeply wounded, as I am. I ask only silence and
                     quiet, for nothing relieves me, not even writing to my Kate!</p>
                  <pb n="454-455" xml:id="VAC6146-00000228"/>
                  <p>"But I'll not write so sadly. I will try and relate cheerfully what has
                     happened to us all. It is nothing, scarcely. There is little that 's new. Papa
                     continues to have gout, but his health, I think, improves with the spring;
                     mamma, too, seems stronger since the advent of May, and Helen and Aunt
                     Seraphina are as blooming as roses. <emph>My</emph> cheeks have not reddened
                     yet, as they will soon, I trust. The spring will, doubtless, restore my
                     strength and spirits, which, you know, dearest, have not been good since—well,
                     let me not speak of that sad subject again. Papa is going to send me, in a day
                     or two, to Mr. Burwell's. He thinks the fresh sea breeze will quite cure
                     me.</p>
                  <p>"I thought I would not write upon sad subjects, but I can think of little
                     besides <emph>that</emph> which my Kate knows about. It continues to depress me
                     very much, and I will tell you how it has been again brought up to me. Since
                     the meeting at Mammy Liza's, of which I told you, I have seen him twice, but we
                     have never spoken.</p>
                  <p>"The first time was at Moorefield, Mr. Alston's, you know, whither we went in
                     the chariot to see Mrs. Alston, Mr. Thomas' aunt. Our staying away was becoming
                     absolutely marked, and so we went. As the chariot drove up to the door,
                        <emph>he</emph> had just mounted his horse to ride away. As I afterwards
                     discovered, he had been staying some days with Mr. Alston, who is sick, and now
                     returned to Williamsburg. He passed within a few feet of the carriage, and made
                     us a low and ceremonious salute. I saw him distinctly, and though still very
                     pale, he looked stronger and more cheerful. His arm was no longer supported by
                     the scarf, and seemed to have quite healed.</p>
                  <p>"I need not tell you, dear, how much I was rejoiced to see him thus well again,
                     and his sickness seemed even to have added to that singular grace which, you
                     know, has ever characterized him. His air had lost none of its dignity, and I
                     observed that extraordinary smile as he passed—a smile which seemed now both
                     happy and sad. All this I descried as he passed quickly; in a moment he was
                     gone. That is the first meeting.</p>
                  <p>"The second was the other evening, and at the old graveyard, where his mother
                     and father are buried, you know. When you were last here, we visited it one
                     afternoon, and, you know, it lies down the vale, within sight of the upper
                     window of my chamber. I can see the distant oaks as I write. Helen and myself
                     had gone out to take a walk about twilight, and we extended it so far that the
                     night caught us, as we passed the old graveyard on our return. The moon was
                     shining, however, and we were not afraid, as we heard the voice of Uncle Robin,
                     on the hill near by, driving home the cattle and singing one of his rude songs.
                     The moonlight was nearly as bright as day as we came near the graveyard, and
                     Helen went to the gate and looked in. You know it is surrounded by an old brick
                     wall, which is beginning to crumble, some of the bricks having been knocked off
                     by mischievous boys, and the enclosure, in other places, cracked by the roots
                     of the trees forcing up.</p>
                  <p>"Helen went to the old wooden gate, which was closed with a log laid against
                     it, and peered through the bars. I followed her, and for a moment we stood thus
                     silently gazing at the tombstones. We were about to return when suddenly we
                     heard a low sigh, and a figure, which had been kneeling in the shadow upon the
                     grave of Aunt St. John, rose erect in the moonlight. We drew back quickly into
                     the shadow of the great oak, for we were somewhat frightened, as you may
                     imagine. In an instant, however, I recognized <emph>him,</emph> and my terror
                     yielded to sorrow. He leaned upon the tall tombstone in the moonlight, and
                     rested his forehead on the cold marble. I shall never forget his figure as he
                     stood thus. His right arm encircled the weeping willow cut on the top of the
                     stone, his long dark hair fell upon the white surface, and only the movement of
                     his breast proved that he himself was not a form of marble. He remained thus
                     for about a quarter of an hour, and then, raising his head, looked in
                     succession at every object in the graveyard, apparently<pb n="456-457"
                        xml:id="VAC6146-00000229"/> bidding them farewell, one after another. He
                     then stooped and plucked a wild rose from the turf on his mother's grave, stood
                     looking at it for a moment, and then slowly passed through a cleft in the wall
                     and disappeared. We heard his horse neigh from a copse near by, and then the
                     sound of hoof-strokes dying gradually into silence. He was gone, and we came
                     home without a word—I think Helen was crying too.</p>
                  <p>"I thought I would write of these two meetings, my own Kate, because it affords
                     me a painful consolation to speak of him. O, why will he leave us? for he came
                     to bid farewell thus to his mother, I know, before going to foreign lands,
                     whither, I 'm told, he would long since have gone but for the late troubles and
                     the sickness of his friend, Mr. Alston. He leaves many who love him, and ask
                     only that he will come back again. My wounded pride is no longer mistress of
                     me, and though he can never be the same to me, I should love and cherish him
                     still—though I never could be his wife.</p>
                  <p>"I am not happy. Please write and give me some comfort, if you can. I must end
                     my sad letter now, dearest. I will write you again from Mr. Burwell's, whither
                     I go, as I said, in a day or two.</p>
                  <p>"Much love to Willie, and farewell, dear.</p>

                     <dateline>"MR. BURWELL'S, Isle of Wight, the 2d June, '75.</dateline>
                  </opener>
                  <p>"IN my last letter, dear Kate, I told you I was coming hither in search of some
                     color for my cheeks. I am sorry to say I 've not found it. I think the air's
                     not as wholesome to me as that of Prince George, and in a day or two I shall
                     set out on my return to Vanely.</p>
                  <p>"I need not tell you that I have received every kindness and goodness from the
                     family. The Burwells are admirably cheerful and kindly, and I think
                     'Belle-bouche,' as they still call her, from some old jest, is a beauty, and as
                     tender as she 's lovely. She delights us as usual—for Bel Tracy is here—with
                     stories about her 'youth,' as she calls it with a laugh, and certainly, from
                     her own relation, Monsieur Belle-bouche, if the name is proper, had a very
                     difficult time in his courtship. They began talking about these old scenes one
                     evening on the portico, when Mr. Mowbray and that dazzling lady, his wife,
                     Mistress Philippa, had ridden over from their house, not far off, and I think
                     the stories which they repeated would make a lively comedy. There seemed to be
                     even more than Belle-bouche told, for she was going on, laughing, when Mistress
                     Philippa stopped her, and blushing deeply, prayed her to refrain. Mr. Mowbray
                     turned his fine head with a smile, and said, 'Silence was better,' after which
                     he went on talking with Mr. Nelson, from Little York. How merry and happy all
                     are, except myself! But that 's envious, and I will not complain.</p>
                  <p>"This is all that I think of to tell you, dear, but I 've forgotten the chief
                     incident of all! Mr. Lindon and myself had a violent scene yesterday morning,
                     and we have parted for the last time, I trust. He renewed his addresses, which,
                     you know, I have repeatedly rejected, and had the discourtesy, when I simply
                     said I could not accept his attentions any further, to reply, that he would yet
                     find the means to make me change my resolution! Can you imagine such rudeness?
                     It aroused all my pride, and I told him, with a look as freezing as ice, that I
                     despised his threat, and cared nothing for him. I regretted it afterwards and
                     do now—I mean my passion, but his tone was insufferable. The scene made me sick
                     all day, but I believe I have now quite recovered from it. I left Mr. Lindon in
                     the parlor, and came up stairs, and he soon went away. His abuse of
                        <emph>him</emph> has for ever ruined him in my estimation.</p>
                  <p>"I must close, as the mail passes very soon, dear. Please write to me a good
                     long letter, such as my Kate knows how<pb n="458-459" xml:id="VAC6146-00000230"
                     /> to write. Direct to Vanely, where I shall be before your letter can
                     arrive.</p>
                  <p>"Do not let my sadness grieve you, and we should trust in our dear heavenly
                     Father, who sends the clouds and the sunshine in mercy. In him I put my
                     trust.</p>
                  <p>"Much love to Willie—I hope you enjoyed your visit to the Hall, where Mr.
                     Hamilton says he saw you.</p>

               <head type="sub">LINDON SMILES.</head>
               <p>AT the moment when Bonnybel folded and sealed the letter last laid before the
                  reader, Lindon entered Williamsburg from the south, riding at full speed, and
                  casting a glance toward the palace as he passed, halted in front of the Raleigh
                  tavern.</p>
               <p>He threw his bridle to a servant, and ordering him to hold his horse, and not take
                  him to the stable, entered the tavern.</p>
               <p>To his demand, whether any one had asked for him, the landlord respectfully
                  replied that a gentleman giving his name as Tag, had done so.</p>
               <p>Where was he?</p>
               <p>In the room which his honor had directed him to be shown to—No. 6, second
                  floor.</p>
               <p>And preceded by a servant, Lindon quickly ascended.</p>
               <p>He was met upon the threshold of the room by no less a personage than Mr. Tag,
                  unsuccessful candidate for the commissariat.</p>
               <p>The door closed behind them, and remained closed for an hour.</p>
               <p>Then it opened, and Lindon gave orders to have dinner served to him and his
                  companion, cautioning the servant to have "plenty of wine."</p>
               <p>The servant bowed respectfully, and hastened to obey, bringing, when he came
                  again, half a dozen bottles of mine host's best Rhenish.</p>
               <p>The dinner went in and came out; and still the two men remained shut up
                  together.</p>
               <p>They remained thus until three o'clock in the afternoon, when they issued forth
                  and descended.</p>
               <p>A second horse came to the door in accordance with Lindon's orders, and he and Mr.
                  Tag got into the saddle, setting forward immediately toward Burwell's ferry on the
                  James.</p>
               <p>As they proceeded through the streets of the town, they perceived that the whole
                  place was in commotion.</p>
               <p>Groups of men assembled at the corners, were discussing with excited voices and
                  gestures, something which seemed to have profoundly aroused the popular mind.</p>
               <p>As the two men pushed onward, and approached the embouchure of Palace street, this
                  agitation grew greater and greater—the crowds still more numerous—and the groups
                  were gathered more closely around those stump-speakers, who give utterance at all
                  times to the general sentiment, rising like bubbles on the waves of commotion.</p>
               <p>From the groups thus gathered around the excited speakers, hoarse murmurs rose
                  from time to time, and even shouts were heard when some sentiment peculiarly
                  acceptable was uttered, or some lengthened or fiery period brought to a defiant
                  close.</p>
               <p>"What the devil are these <foreign xml:lang="FRA">canaille</foreign> talking
                  about?" said Lindon disdainfully to his companion; "let us listen."</p>
               <p>"Let us listen, sir."</p>
               <p>They soon discovered. From his lofty position in the saddle, Lindon looked down
                  upon the excited figures of the<pb n="460-461" xml:id="VAC6146-00000231"/>
                  speakers, swaying to and fro in the gusts of oratory; and distinctly heard the
                  words which they uttered.</p>
               <p>The popular commotion was excited by a report just disseminated, that Captain
                  Collins, by the orders of his Excellency, Lord Dunmore, was marching at the head
                  of a company of his marines, to take vengeance on the city of Williamsburg for the
                  late outrages; intending to reduce that city to ashes.</p>
               <p>This was the sudden rumor which had drawn the population from their houses into
                  the streets; and the sudden nature of this sally, at a moment's notice,
                  sufficiently proved that the general feeling was as fiery as ever, and that every
                  one looked forward to critical events, and was prepared for the issue. The
                  specious words of his Excellency had not deceived a single individual; and
                  Williamsburg had never been so thoroughly on its guard, as it was when the powder
                  affair was arranged.</p>
               <p>It now rose <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en masse,</foreign> as we have seen, at a
                  word, and all classes—from the members of the House of Burgesses, which assembled
                  on the day before, to the humblest citizen of the town—all was violent commotion
                  and expectation.</p>
               <p>More than one sinister glance was directed toward Lindon as he proceeded, for he
                  was recognized as lieutenant of the Governor's guard. But no violence was offered
                  him, and he was allowed to proceed quietly.</p>
               <p>"Fools!" he muttered; "you are as fearful as children! You make bugbears and
                  tremble at them! With a single company I 'd crush out your sedition, and teach you
                  your duty to the government!"</p>
               <p>In spite, however, of this lofty tone, Lindon hastened the speed of his horse, and
                  arriving thus, followed by Tag, at the outskirts of the town, betrayed visible
                  satisfaction at the event.</p>
               <p>He looked back at the crowd which seemed gradually diminishing, and then turning
                  his head in front again, encountered the gaze of a horseman coming into, as he was
                  leaving, Williamsburg.</p>
               <p>As he and the horseman exchanged low and ceremonious salutes, a cold and sinister
                  smile for a moment illuminated Lindon's countenance; and this smile became one of
                  triumph as the horseman passed on and disappeared.</p>
               <p>That horseman was Mr. St. John, who, having bid adieu to his friend, Tom Alston,
                  now came to make his preparations to leave Virginia, as he had said, "never to
                  return."</p>

               <head type="sub">THE TWO LETTERS.</head>
               <p>BONNYBEL had rightly supposed that nothing but the sickness of Mr. Alston had
                  detained Mr. St. John in Virginia. That sickness having now yielded, he rapidly
                  made every preparation, and paid his adieus to the places, the things, the
                  personages of his youth.</p>
               <p>She had chanced to meet him as he bade farewell to the tombs of his mother and his
                  father—that was the last and saddest of all. From that moment his heart was
                  dissevered from the soil, and he no longer thought of any thing but another land
                  where he might forget his sufferings and his misfortunes.</p>
               <p>It was on Friday, the second day of June, when the young man entered Williamsburg,
                  and on the morning of Monday, the fifth, he was informed by a message from Captain
                  Fellowes of the "Charming Sally," that at twilight the brig would sail for
                  Europe.</p>
               <p>He hastened to make the final preparations for his long journey, and as this was
                  to be his last sight of Virginia, he sought all his friends to say farewell.</p>
               <p>The stranger was absent, and he sought him in vain at the well-remembered place;
                  with a sigh, he gave up the search and retired.</p>
               <p>As he went toward the Raleigh, where his horse was<pb n="462-463"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000232"/> waiting, he met Captain Waters, who was strolling
                  along humming a song.</p>
               <p>When he announced his intention of departing, the worthy captain stood aghast, and
                  then he plied every possible argument to induce him to change his resolution.</p>
               <p>We need scarcely say that these arguments were in vain, and at the end of an hour
                  the captain found that he had simply expended so much breath in vain.</p>
               <p>"Well," he said, "never have I seen such a perfect block! Mark me, friend, you 'll
                  regret this proceeding! It is the maddest thing, <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >morbleu!</foreign> which I ever heard of!"</p>
               <p>"I know you think so."</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Parbleu!</foreign> I do think so; but as you are
                  determined, I have no more to say."</p>
               <p>"I know I have your good wishes, my dear friend, and I believe you sincerely
                  regret our parting. But believe me, 't is necessary for me to go. When I shall
                  return I know not."</p>
               <p>"Basta!" cried the captain, knitting his brows, "that 's the very thing! If you
                  were coming back soon 't would be quite another thing, but I doubt if you 'll ever
                  return!"</p>
               <p>"And I too, my dear captain, most seriously. Well, well, I must go. You would not
                  ask me to stay if you knew why I go. Tell your brother, whose relationship to you,
                  strangely enough, never occurred to me until lately—tell Mr. Charles Waters good
                  bye for me."</p>
               <p>"There it is! you take this moment when he 's away. He 'll be furious!"</p>
               <p>And the captain frowned to hide his emotion.</p>
               <p>"I would willingly defer my departure to see him," said St. John, sadly, "but I
                  have staid longer now than I intended owing to Tom Alston's sickness. The
                  'Charming Sally' sails at twilight with the wind."</p>
               <p>"The 'Charming Sally?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"You go in her?"</p>
               <p>"This evening."</p>
               <p>"Captain Fellowes?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is the captain's name. What are you thinking of?"</p>
               <p>The captain's brows drooped, and a sigh shook his breast.</p>
               <p>"I was thinking of old times, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami,</foreign> and of
                  other faces. Pardon me, 't is a bad habit, and, <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >morbleu!</foreign> I must break myself thereof. But again she rose before me
                  as I heard that name—the old days all rushed back—I saw her, Beatrice, one whom
                  you never knew, whom I loved! There! there! my mind wanders to another epoch. Let
                  us dismiss the subject."</p>
               <p>St. John inclined his head.</p>
               <p>"Yonder is Jack Hamilton," he said, gazing sadly at the approaching figure, "I
                  will bid him farewell again; a long farewell, for I shall never return."</p>
               <p>And the young man smiled, but so sorrowfully that a moisture came to the soldier's
                  brilliant eye.</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Ventre Sainte Gris!</foreign>" cried the captain, dashing
                  his hand across his eyes; "do you know, comrade, you make me cry like a baby with
                  your sad way of talking? Something 's wrong with me or I never would feel
                  thus."</p>
               <p>"Something 's right with you, friend," said St. John, again smiling, as he looked
                  at the honest soldier; "'t is your heart!"</p>
               <p>And leading Tallyho by the bridle, he went to meet Jack Hamilton, whose face at
                  sight of St. John clouded over, and lengthened deplorably.</p>
               <p>To all the protestations and persuasive arguments of his friends the young man
                  made brief replies. He must go; all was ended.</p>
               <p>"Could any thing induce me to continue in Virginia," he said, "'t would be the
                  true hearts of men like you—faces I would not go away from but for an inexorable
                  destiny which drives me. You will think of me sometimes, though, will you not?" he
                  said, holding a hand of each. "Under other stars I will think of you," and
                  pressing the hands of<pb n="464-465" xml:id="VAC6146-00000233"/> the two men, who
                  looked at him with drooping heads, the young man made a movement to get into the
                  saddle.</p>
               <p>At the same moment he heard his name uttered by the voice of a child, and, turning
                  around, found himself accosted by Blossom.</p>
               <p>The child was almost breathless with the haste she had used to reach him, and her
                  bosom labored heavily for a moment. Then, regaining her breath, she said, looking
                  at Mr. St. John with deep affection,</p>
               <p>"You will not leave us, will you, sir?"</p>
               <p>"I must, my child; I am glad I have met you. Take my love and this kiss," he
                  added, stooping and pressing his lips to those of the child, "and pray for
                  me."</p>
               <p>The tears rushed to Blossom's eyes, and she clung to his hand obstinately.</p>
               <p>"Oh, do not go!" she said, sobbing, "please do not go, sir!"</p>
               <p>"I must, my dear. 'T is written, as the Orientals say. Farewell!"</p>
               <p>Blossom seemed to be too much overcome to speak, but, seeming suddenly to remember
                  something, put her hand into her pocket and took there from a letter.</p>
               <p>"Papa told me to give you this or make Uncle Ralph give it to you," she said,
                  blinded with tears; then, bursting into sobs again, she cried, "Oh, do not go
                  away! please do not go away! Papa said you were going away never to come back. Oh!
                  please do not go!"</p>
               <p>The young man smiled sadly, but shook his head. His eye fell carelessly upon the
                  letter, which seemed to be double, and he tore it open. It was, in truth, two
                  letters. The first was in the hand-writing of the stranger, and contained these
                  words:</p>
               <q>
                  <floatingText>
                     <body>
                        <div type="letter">
                           <p>"I have looked everywhere to find you, friend, having, by a strange
                              chance, received what I know is of importance to you. 'T is a letter
                              which, with this, I entrust to my child, having an instant call away;
                              my foot is in the stirrup. 'T will reach you in time, however, I do
                              not doubt, for Blossom has the unerring instinct of affection, to
                              which I trust.</p>
                           <p>"You might remember that one night when you visited me I opened my
                              drawer, while you were speaking, and drew forth a letter which I
                              looked at with what probably seemed to you discourtesy. That letter
                              was, however, about yourself, and others have reached me of the same
                              tenor. I have not spoken with you about these affairs, but I am
                              convinced, that, in the matter of your suffering, you are the victim
                              of some diabolical conspiracy and fraud.</p>
                           <p>"To the point now. I was traveling yesterday in Isle of Wight county,
                              post haste, when, just as I passed the residence of the man Lindon,
                              lieutenant of the guards, I was accosted by a servant girl who
                              delivered me the enclosed letter, saying that her mistress bade her
                              bring it me. On a slip of paper was written, in a woman's hand, 'If
                              you are a friend of justice and right bear this to Mr. Henry St. John,
                              of Prince George county.' I took the letter, brought it hither, and
                              searched everywhere for you. I think it contains what most nearly
                              concerns you, and, in giving it to Blossom, I do best. You must,
                              necessarily, visit Williamsburg for preparations before your
                              departure, if you depart, and she or my brother Ralph will deliver
                              it.</p>
                           <p>"I know not what the letter contains, but a presentiment—a sentiment I
                              can not explain, bids me say to you, do not leave Virginia till you
                              see the woman who wrote that letter.</p>
                           <p>"I can add no more, friend. My horse neighs, and the cause calls me.
                              Every moment now is a century. Farewell.</p>
                           <closer>
                              <signed>"C. W."</signed>

               </q>
               <p>Mr. St. John finished the letter, and, looking from Blossom to Captain Waters, and
                  from the soldier to Hamilton, with blank, wondering eyes, seemed for a time
                  speechless with astonishment at the contents of the stranger's letter.</p>
               <p>Then, letting the paper fall, he turned over the other letter, which was securely
                  sealed and directed to "Mr. Henry St. John, Prince George county."</p>
               <p>Mechanically, without looking at it intelligently, as it<pb n="466-467"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000234"/> were, he opened it and held it for some moments in
                  his hand without reading it. Then his eyes fell upon the sheet.</p>
               <p>No sooner had he read the first few lines, however, than a fiery flush blazed on
                  his cheeks, his hands grasped the letter so violently as almost to tear it
                  asunder, and with his distended eyes glued to the paper he ran over its contents
                  rapidly, and ending it, almost gasped for breath.</p>
               <p>A deadly paleness invaded his countenance, a tremor ran through his frame, and
                  holding out the paper, he tried to say to Waters and Hamilton, "Read!" His dumb
                  lips did not utter a sound, however, and he stood thus like a statue of
                  marble.</p>
               <p>Waters caught the letter and ran hastily over it.</p>

               <p>THE letter was evidently written by a woman, and ran as follows:</p>

                           <p>"The words which you are about to read come from one who has been
                              guilty of deception, treachery, forgery and robbery, and therefore at
                              first you may not give credit to my statements. Before I have finished
                              what I design writing, however, you will give implicit credence to
                              what I say.</p>
                           <p>"I write this at Agincourt, the house of your enemy and rival, Lindon,
                              and I do so at the peril of my life. I think I can bribe the servant
                              who waits on me, however, and whom her master has sold, and I shall
                              run the risk. The interview which I have just had with this man, and
                              his outrageous treatment, have made me resolve to hazard every thing,
                              and I do not conceal the fact that my motive in addressing you is
                              wholly to take my revenge on him.</p>
                           <p>"The hours are long here, sir, and I have much time on my hands. I
                              shall employ this leisure in revealing to you the conspiracy which has
                              made your life miserable, and yet been of no benefit either to the one
                              who conceived it or to his tool—myself.</p>
                           <p>"Listen, sir. I was born in Italy, and my parents having removed to
                              England, I was there brought up and well educated. Then they came to
                              Virginia, and within a year after our arrival both my parents died,
                              and I was thrown upon the world without any fixed principles or
                              regular employment. I became finally a seamstress at Pate's shop in
                              Williamsburg, and here this man, Lindon, who had before made me
                              unworthy proposals, came to seek me. He had many conversations with
                              me, and asked me if I had nerve to undertake an enterprise requiring
                              skill and secrecy; if it was done in accordance with his views and
                              effected its object, he would pay me one thousand pounds.</p>
                           <p>"Follow me closely now, sir, in my narrative, and you will see the
                              steps by which your misery was effected. I had always been avaricious
                              and am now—I would sell my soul for money, and I do not conceal the
                              fact. When Lindon offered me the thousand pounds, I said I would do
                              any and every thing which he demanded. At first he made no distinct
                              promise, and it was only one night at the Indian Camp, where I
                              accompanied him disguised as a man, that he directly offered me the
                              large sum.</p>
                           <p>"Now, would you like to know Mr. Lindon's project? He was in love
                              with, or at least wished to marry, Miss Vane, and you were his rival.
                              He thought that if you were removed, or what amounted to the same
                              thing, the girl's mind poisoned against you, she would fall an easy
                              prey to his assiduity or his wiles. My part was to go to Vanely and
                              thus poison the young lady's heart against you. Of course you will
                              hate and wish to strike me, perhaps kill me, after what follows, but
                              that is nothing. You had much better strike<pb n="468-469"
                                 xml:id="VAC6146-00000235"/> Lindon. Well, I at once set about my
                              scheme. One day the ladies came into the shop and I offered to work
                              for them. It is not often that seamstresses will go into the country,
                              and they readily accepted my offer. I remember seeing you gazing from
                              your window at the girl in a window of Mr. Burwell's house on the
                              night before I left town with them in the chariot, and I half
                              relented. But the sum of money decided me.</p>
                           <p>"I went to Vanely and commenced my part almost immediately, but your
                              duel and what followed it came too soon. I waited. At last you went to
                              Williamsburg to see to the repairs of your house, and then I had a
                              fair field. Lindon had supplied me with some of your writing, and I
                              forged letters from you to the girl—letters which gradually grew
                              lukewarm, then cool, then short and stiff. I intercepted every one
                              which you really wrote to her. Her letters to yourself I suppressed,
                              and this I easily effected, as I carried the letter bag always to the
                              servant and received it from him.</p>
                           <p>"You came to see the young lady several times. On the first occasion
                              she treated you coolly; I watched through the door. On the second, I
                              had so poisoned her mind, that she would scarcely look at you; and, on
                              this second visit, I secured what I had often coveted, your signet
                              ring. I entered your apartment two hours after midnight, and stole the
                              signet from the toilet table. Then mastered by curiosity to see how a
                              man slept when his heart was breaking, I approached your bed. You
                              awoke, sprung up, and I had just time to escape. You probably supposed
                              that it was a dream; it was myself, sir.</p>
                           <p>"Well, having secured your signet, I had no longer any fears. My
                              proficiency in imitating hand-writing, which I had learned at a common
                              school in England, enabled me to forge letters from you; and the stamp
                              of your motto on the seal placed these letters beyond all doubt. I
                              shaped the contents of these letters so as to indicate a gradual
                              change of feeling on your part. At first, lukewarm as I said, then
                              cool, then jesting and careless, then indifferent. I placed one after
                              another in the mail bag—and under the forgeries, I saw the young lady
                              tremble and shrink, and her peace of mind pass away, yielding to anger
                              and despair—until when you came, she refused to see you. I could have
                              killed myself for my treachery, for she is as good as she is
                              beautiful; but the accursed money controlled and mastered me.</p>
                           <p>"At last the end came. You wrote a letter which I well recollect, for
                              it bore the marks of the delirium which soon attacked you. It
                              commenced with the words, 'Is it wrong for me to write to you?' and
                              was written immediately after that third and last visit, upon which
                              occasion she refused to see you, and you left abruptly.</p>
                           <p>"This letter very nearly reached her, for she seemed, by a strange
                              instinct, to suspect something, and now went forth herself to meet the
                              servant who brought the letters from the office. On this evening I
                              accompanied her, although she tried to repulse me; and before she
                              could take the bag, I had it in my own hand. I slipped your letter up
                              my sleeve, and presented to her the one which I had forged and held
                              ready, the post-mark and every thing down to the rumpling of the
                              edges, being perfectly feigned. In that letter I made you declare that
                              you had been too hasty, and would think more seriously before you
                              undertook to marry; and I saw her tremble and turn pale as she read
                              it.</p>
                           <p>"It was <emph>my</emph> reply which you read. She wrote none—pride
                              succeeded agony, and she permitted her heart to break in silence
                              without speaking. I wrote the answer, in which I declared, in the
                              character of the young lady, that your letter was 'strange;' that the
                              alterations in your manor house concerned only yourself; and ended, by
                              breaking off the engagement. I next heard that you were sick—she
                              visited you in your sleep—and then you went away, and all was over. I
                              had accomplished my object—I had played my part—and I had even done it
                              so adroitly, that she felt an honorable scruple against uttering a
                              word to the family. Her sister endeavored in vain to extort from her
                              any thing<pb n="470-471" xml:id="VAC6146-00000236"/> contained in
                                 <emph>my</emph> letters, and I doubt if to this moment she has told
                              any thing. Her pure and noble nature was true to itself through all;
                              and though her heart was broken, she did not speak. I had thus
                              conquered by fraud, treachery, and robbery, a young girl's
                              heart—conquered, by appealing to that immense weakness of woman,
                                 <emph>pride</emph>—and I went to my master, after your departure,
                              and asked for my reward.</p>
                           <p>"What do you suppose, sir, was his reply? He denied that he had ever
                              made any such arrangement with me; and when I threatened, in my wrath
                              and disappointment, to expose his part in the matter, he took
                              advantage of his power and made me a close prisoner here, in his house
                              of Agincourt. Here I have remained since the month of October last,
                              the prisoner of this man, who either watches over me himself, or
                              employs a brutal jailor, who has twice struck me, as if I were a slave
                              or a mad woman.</p>
                           <p>"Well, sir, I have now informed you of the means which I used to
                              destroy your happiness, and I have shown you that my treachery
                              resulted in no gain. I am about to make some amends for my crime by
                              informing you of a scheme which intimately concerns your peace of
                              mind. Lindon came hither to my apartment yesterday, and, in a spirit
                              of bravado, laid before me, at length, a design which he will surely
                              accomplish.</p>
                           <p>"It is his intention to waylay Miss Vane, who is now upon a visit to
                              Mr. Burwell's, in this county, and who designs soon to return. His
                              intention, I say, is to waylay her carriage, and bring her here to
                              this place by force. Once here, a hedge parson, named Tag, is to marry
                              her to Lindon, and the whole scheme will be complete.</p>
                           <p>"I write these lines, as I said, that, through your instrumentality, I
                              may have revenge upon this man. I hate him with a deadly hatred, and,
                              if I have my revenge, you may do any thing you please with me. I care
                              not.</p>

                              learned, Miss Vane sets out on her return."</p>

               <p>These were the words which made St. John turn pale and crimson, and his eyes blaze
                  as with lightning.</p>
               <p>Captain Waters had scarcely read five lines before St. John seized the letter and
                  pointed hoarsely to the last paragraph, then to the postscript.</p>
               <p>"To-day is the fifth of June!" cried the young man, as Waters and Hamilton looked
                  at the letter with wondering eyes,"and it is past noon already!"</p>
               <p>Captain Waters, without a word, pointed to the young man's horse, and then
                  hastened into the Raleigh for his own. Hamilton followed him.</p>
               <p>In fifteen minutes the three men left Williamsburg at a furious gallop, and, on
                  fire with excitement, struck the spurs into their horses and took the open highway
                  to the south.</p>

               <head type="sub">FIRE AND STORM.</head>
               <p>THEY rapidly crossed the river, plunged into the forest, and fled straight across
                  the country in the direction of the point which they wished to reach.</p>
               <p>St. John was well acquainted with the district, and chose, with unerring
                  precision, the shortest roads.</p>
               <p>Leaning forward in his saddle, the young man seemed to be devoured by a terrible
                  passion, and, at every bound, he struck his horse furiously with the spur, and
                  shouted hoarsely to him, as though he were a human being.</p>
               <p>Tallyho responded nobly to his master's will, and the man and the animal fled
                  onward like a single body.</p>
               <p>The captain and Hamilton were at St. John's side. Riding Selim, that noble Arabian
                  who, in old days, had distanced<pb n="472-473" xml:id="VAC6146-00000237"/> tanced
                  the best steeds of Virginia, and whose speed age had not diminished, leaning over,
                  as did St. John, and impelled by the same passion which drove his friend on like a
                  tempest, the worthy soldier kept pace with the most furious rush of his companion,
                  and strained his eyes forward into the distance.</p>
               <p>"We 'll kill our horses, if necessary," said the young man, hoarsely, "but we 'll
                  arrive!"</p>
               <p>"We 'll arrive!" repeated the soldier and Hamilton, and they plunged their spurs
                  into their animals.</p>
               <p>The three horses ran neck and neck, and, passing now like shadows over the soft,
                  sandy road, they resembled phantoms intent upon some weird enterprise of
                  darkness.</p>
               <p>It was not long before actual darkness came to add verisimilitude to the idea. The
                  west, which had been clear an hour before, now filled with black clouds, and, from
                  these clouds, piled up in huge ebon masses, fringed by the crimson of sunset,
                  flashes of lightning began to gleam, illuminating the whole heavens with their
                  lurid splendor.</p>
               <p>One of those brief but terrible storms which visit Virginia at this season, was
                  lowering, and the mutter of thunder, every moment growing louder, showed that the
                  tempest was near at hand.</p>
               <p>The cavaliers still pushed on at headlong speed, without uttering a word. The hot
                  mouths of the horses were nearly touching, the clouds of foam, from their burning
                  nostrils, mingled and fled away in the gathering darkness.</p>
               <p>"If they are married when we arrive, I 'll make the new wife a widow!" cried the
                  young man, through his clenched teeth, in a voice hoarse with passion. "I 'll
                  plunge my sword into his heart, as I would into a dog's."</p>
               <p>"And I!" added Hamilton.</p>
               <p>"Good!" said the captain.</p>
               <p>"Faster! faster!" howled the young man; "every instant is a lifetime!"</p>
               <p>And he plunged his spur anew in "Tallyho," who leaped ten feet and quivered.</p>
               <p>Hamilton and the captain were at the side of their friend still.</p>
               <p>"How far?" said Hamilton.</p>
               <p>"Five miles only! Come!"</p>
               <p>As the young man spoke, a dazzling flash darted from the black clouds, and a roar
                  of thunder, like the discharge of a battery, shook the forest.</p>
               <p>The startled animals snorted, and fled on beneath the overshadowing boughs of the
                  forest more rapidly.</p>
               <p>For a quarter of an hour no word was spoken, no sound was heard, but the rumbling
                  of thunder, and the rapid hoof-strokes of the horses.</p>
               <p>Suddenly they issued forth into the open country, and St. John stretched out his
                  hand and said, hoarsely,</p>
               <p>"There is the house!"</p>
               <p>"Where?" said the captain.</p>
               <p>"There, rising over the woods! Faster!"</p>
               <p>And the young man struck his horse, with his clenched hand, on the neck.</p>
               <p>The captain looked in the direction indicated, and saw a large edifice, embowered
                  in foliage, and gilded now by the lurid rays of the bloody sun flashing from
                  beneath the thunder cloud as it sunk from sight.</p>
               <p>"Is that Lindon's?" he said.</p>
               <p>"Yes! how 's your horse?"</p>
               <p>"Quite fresh yet!"</p>
               <p>"And mine 's nearly dead, but that 's nothing."</p>
               <p>They fled on.</p>
               <p>The storm, which had been long gathering, now seemed about to burst. Vivid flashes
                  of lightning succeeding each other with rapidity, illuminated the darkness, and
                  the very earth seemed shaken by the warring thunder, which crashed down like the
                  rush of an ocean.</p>
               <p>The frightened horses rather flew than ran, and their coats, bathed in sweat and
                  foam, showed the immense exertion they had undergone.</p>
               <p>Another woods was passed through, and just as darkness<pb n="474-475"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000238"/> and storm descended, the three men drew up before
                  the edifice.</p>
               <p>A vivid blaze of lightning struck the great elm at the door as they checked their
                  foaming horses, and splintered it from top to bottom.</p>
               <p>At the same moment a blinding torrent of rain descended, and the three men threw
                  themselves from the saddle and rushed forward.</p>
               <p>In another moment they stood in the great hall of the house, and their eyes
                  penetrated into the large apartment.</p>
               <p>Had not the captain laid a violent hand on the shoulder of St. John, the young man
                  would have burst into the room.</p>
               <p>The sight was enough to arouse him.</p>
               <p>With his back to the door, Lindon stood with one arm round Bonnybel, who seemed
                  nearly fainting—in front of the couple, Tag, the miserable hedge-priest, with an
                  open prayer book in his hand, was reading the marriage service.</p>
               <p>Two rough-looking men stood by as witnesses, and in a corner, bowed down upon a
                  chair, old Cato, the Vanely coachman, was ringing his hands and crying like a
                  child.</p>
               <p>Suddenly the words resounded, "If any man can show just cause why this couple may
                  not lawfully be joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter for ever
                  hold his peace."</p>
               <p>A scream from the girl, so piercing and full of anguish that it rose above the
                  very roar of the storm, sent a shudder through the frames of the auditors without,
                  two of whom held back the third, whose eyes glared like a madman's as he
                  looked.</p>
               <p>"O, no! no!" cried the girl, struggling to disengage herself from Lindon's arm;
                  "he brought me here by force! I was seized and dragged here! I will die before I
                  become his wife!"</p>
               <p>The girl had scarcely uttered these words, and still writhed to get free, when St.
                  John broke from his companions and threw himself, like a wild beast, upon
                  Lindon.</p>
               <p>So tremendous was the blind passion of the young man, that, great as was the
                  strength and bulk of his adversary, he was hurled to the ground like a child—St.
                  John falling with his enemy, locked in a mortal embrace.</p>
               <p>At the same instant the captain and his companion rushed with drawn swords upon
                  the accomplices, who, uttering cries, retreated before them hastily and
                  disappeared in the darkness.</p>
               <p>St. John's struggle with Lindon was not protracted. The infuriated man caught a
                  pistol from his belt, and placing the muzzle on his enemy's breast, drew the
                  trigger. The murderous weapon hung fire, and a blow on the head, from the sword
                  hilt of St. John, made him relax his grasp, and fall back stunned and
                  senseless.</p>
               <p>St. John rose to his feet, pale and bleeding from a wound in his temple, and
                  seeing the girl totter, at the moment, toward a chair, he placed his arm round
                  her, and prevented her from falling.</p>
               <p>She clung to him in an agony of terror, with the wild agitation of a child who
                  flies to a protector, and at the contact of those arms, at that face again laid
                  near his own, the young man felt a thrill of bitter delight run through his
                  frame.</p>
               <p>"O, take me away!" she sobbed; "take me from this dreadful place! O, I shall die
                  if I stay here longer!"</p>
               <p>"That is true," said a low voice; "truer than you think. The house is on
                  fire!"</p>
               <p>And Miss Carne, standing on the threshold of the apartment, pointed with her
                  finger to the adjoining room. As she did so, a sudden gust of smoke and flame
                  invaded the one which they occupied.</p>
               <p>"In five minutes escape will be cut off!" cried the pale woman, and she
                  disappeared in the hall.</p>
               <p>St. John raised the girl in his arms like a child, and just as the flame rushed
                  roaring upon them, bore her forth into the storm, the whole broadside of the
                  edifice bursting into flame.</p>
               <pb n="476-477" xml:id="VAC6146-00000239"/>
               <p>"'T is a horrible death" cried Hamilton; "he 's senseless and—"</p>
               <p>"Look!" shouted Waters, "the dog 's come to his wits!"</p>
               <p>In truth, Lindon seemed to have recovered completely, for in the midst of the
                  brilliant space, upon which torrents of rain descended, lit by lightning flashes,
                  he appeared suddenly, pale, furious and despairing.</p>
               <p>Looking around him with the air of one who is demented, he shook his clenched hand
                  at his enemies, uttered a horrible oath, grasped at his belt, where no sword hung,
                  and leaping upon one of the horses, disappeared at headlong speed, like a fury, in
                  the darkness.</p>
               <p>The wild vision had scarcely vanished in the forest when another spectacle
                  attracted the attention of the shuddering group.</p>
               <p>It was a woman at one of the loftiest windows who half threw herself out, driven,
                  it seemed, by the scorching flame. The cry which she uttered was awful in the
                  intensity of its terror. Suddenly, however, she disappeared, and returned with a
                  cord which she affixed rapidly to the sill. Then, holding between her teeth a
                  casket, she swung by this cord safely to the top of the great portico, slid with
                  incredible agility along the moulding, and fell to the ground, from which she rose
                  and disappeared like Lindon in the storm.</p>
               <p>It was Miss Carne, who had broken open the coffers of her enemy and escaped.</p>
               <p>As she disappeared, the whole house became one great mass of hissing and crackling
                  flame, and this flame roared for hours without cessation, wall after wall falling
                  with a crash until the ruin was complete.</p>
               <p>Bonnybel had long before been assisted into the Vanely chariot, which old Cato got
                  ready with nervous haste. Escorted by the three gentlemen it was now proceeding
                  rapidly toward Prince George through the last mutterings of the storm.</p>
               <p>Faint and weak, scarcely realizing that the scene through which she had just
                  passed was not some hideous dream, the young lady felt herself borne along, hour
                  after hour, until, at last, she saw the welcome walls of Vanely, which began to
                  loom out indistinctly in the first gray glimmer of dawn.</p>
               <p>The gentlemen who escorted her resembled dusky shadows as they assisted her from
                  the chariot. She felt a letter placed in her hand, heard some murmured words, and
                  then one shadow only remained at her side.</p>
               <p>Captain Waters and St. John set out at once for Williamsburg in pursuit of Lindon,
                  who had bent his steps thither.</p>
               <p>"Time enough afterward for explanations," said St. John, as they departed at full
                  gallop; "come, captain, and see me excute my private vengeance!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER LXXXIX.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE END OF THE DRAMA.</head>
               <p>THE speed of their horses was so great that the two men entered Williamsburg as
                  the sun was rising.</p>
               <p>The leagues seemed to have fled from beneath the feet of the animals—the gray,
                  glimmering landscape had flitted by like a dream.</p>
               <p>As they rushed onward toward the town which gleamed before them now, they heard a
                  measured and yet confused noise, at times rising to a roar almost. Something
                  important was evidently taking place.</p>
               <p>The hoofs of the horses clashed on the stones; the riders leaned forward in the
                  saddle to see what was going on. In an instant they were in the midst of a
                  shouting and tumultuous crowd.</p>
               <p>The capital seemed convulsed.</p>
               <p>The crowd which had thronged the streets three or four days before seemed nothing
                  in comparison with the fiery<pb n="478-479" xml:id="VAC6146-00000240"/> multitude
                  which now surged to and fro from the college to the capitol—from the palace of the
                  governor to the old magazine. This last was the center from which radiated the
                  shouts and cries—the heart from which the hot blood flowed.</p>
               <p>The whole population seemed driven to fury. The two men heard that hoarse and
                  somber roar which accompanies the movements of an enraged multitude, as it does
                  the tossing of the sea when lashed by tempests.</p>
               <p>At one spot, before the old magazine, the excitement seemed to culminate. Here the
                  huge waves of the crowd rolled to and fro, surrounding, with their tumult and
                  uproar, the form of a man who succeeded in standing erect only by leaning on the
                  shoulders of two others.</p>
               <p>This person was pale and bleeding from a wound in the shoulder.</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Morbleu!</foreign> something strange has happened!"
                  muttered the captain; "let us find out," and he addressed his question to one of
                  the crowd. The information was soon obtained. Dunmore had affixed concealed spring
                  guns at the door of the magazine, and the wounded man, in opening the door, had
                  received a full charge of slugs in his shoulder and breast.</p>
               <p>The face of the soldier flushed like fire, and his hoarse exclamation was added to
                  those of the crowd, which every moment seemed to lash itself to greater fury.</p>
               <p>"Ah, well!" he growled, bringing round the hilt of his sword; "the moment comes at
                  last! we will fight, friend! Listen to that roar, like the growl of a lion at bay!
                  And look yonder!"</p>
               <p>St. John followed the pointed finger, and saw that the Governor's guards, mounted
                  and fully equipped, were drawn up before the gate of the palace. Two loaded cannon
                  were directed point blank upon the furious multitude.</p>
               <p>St. John pushed his horse through the agitated mass, and riding up to the cannon,
                  followed close by Waters, said to one of the men who recognized him,</p>
               <p>"Where is your captain—Mr. Lindon?"</p>
               <p>The man whom he addressed looked strangely at him, and replied with the single
                  word,</p>
               <p>"Within."</p>
               <p>"Come friend," cried St. John, throwing himself from his horse, the bridle of
                  which he hastily affixed to the wall; "let us enter! Our game is not here!"</p>
               <p>"You are right!" growled the captain, dismounting quickly; "<emph>my</emph> game
                  too is there—it is Foy!"</p>
               <p>And they hurried onward to the palace. It was in the wildest confusion. The
                  servants were hastening in every direction with affrighted looks, and there was no
                  one to announce them.</p>
               <p>St. John heard the voice of Dunmore, however, in the great apartment which he knew
                  so well; and without ceremony threw open the door.</p>
               <p>As he did so, Captain Foy, who was rushing out, struck against him. The secretary
                  was armed to the teeth. A heavy saber rattled against his horseman's boots, and
                  his leather belt was stuck round with pistols. His somber calmness had all
                  disappeared. His dark eyes burned with ferocious excitement, and a sort of
                  audacious pride; his cheek flushed with the thought of the coming contest. As he
                  rushed by toward the hostile crowd, he seemed filled with the <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">gaudium certaminis.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>He scowled and then smiled with grim satisfaction, as he recognized the two men;
                  and then in a martial and strident voice,</p>
               <p>"Come, Captain Waters!" he said; "the moment has arrived. The pen yields to the
                  sword as I promised you!"</p>
               <p>A flush of joy rushed to the martial features of Waters, and leaving the side of
                  his companion, he rushed after Foy.</p>
               <p>"I will be with you in an instant!" said St. John. "I have my own game too. In a
                  moment—or Lindon will escape!"</p>
               <p>And as the two men disappeared, he hastily entered the apartment of the
                  Governor.</p>
               <pb n="480-481" xml:id="VAC6146-00000241"/>
               <p>But he recoiled from the threshold.</p>
               <p>At the sight which greeted him, he turned pale and trembled; a cold sweat burst
                  from his forehead, looking around as though seeking for some means of escape from
                  the spectacle which riveted his staring, and horror-struck eyes.</p>
               <p>Stretched on a sofa opposite the table of the Governor, lay the dead body of
                  Lindon, clearly relieved against the red damask of the couch.</p>
               <p>His haughty features were deadly pale—his heavy brows were knit into a frown of
                  rage and despair—his entire frill and waistcoat were bathed in blood; and looking
                  again, the young man saw that his bosom was completely torn to pieces.</p>
               <p>St. John recoiled in irresistible horror. As he did so, Dunmore, who was
                  surrounded by his crouching and terror-stricken family, rose wrathfully to his
                  feet.</p>
               <p>"So you come, like a vulture, to croak over death!" he cried, hoarse with passion
                  and agitation; "you scent the carrion, and rush toward it!"</p>
               <p>The young man was speechless with horror and disgust at the spectacle, and the
                  words of Dunmore. He could not speak.</p>
               <p>"You do not answer! you pretend ignorance!" cried the Governor, looking at the
                  dusty garments and horseman's boots of St. John; "you would say that the death of
                  this person was unknown to you! Well, I 'll soon explain that, sir! I placed guns
                  to defend the arms of his Majesty in the magazine, from the rioters of this
                  capital and province. For what reason I know not, nor do I care, Mr. Lindon went
                  thither, and met with the accident that resulted in his death! I suppose you will
                  say that it was all <emph>my</emph> fault! I say it was his own. He deserted me,
                  and met his reward."</p>
               <p>St. John almost recoiled from the speaker, as he had done from the dead body—with
                  a sentiment of awful horror and disgust. Then his mind's eye, with a
                  lightning-like glance, saw Lindon again rushing, <emph>without his sword,</emph>
                  from the burning house—he imagined the unfortunate man flying to Williamsburg
                  liamsburg—he saw him stop at the magazine, the key of which he carried, to procure
                  a sword; he heard the tremendous explosion, and saw them bear the shattered and
                  bleeding body to the palace.</p>
               <p>"Yes, he met with his proper reward!" repeated Dunmore, with wrathful agitation;
                  "you do not answer, sir. Am I not to hear your highness' insults?"</p>
               <p>St. John had no time to reply. A roar, like that of a great dyke giving way to the
                  rush of waters, rolled in from the street. The crowd had just discovered several
                  barrels of gunpowder, buried beneath the floor of the magazine, with trains
                  attached; and this new enormity, in addition to the rest, made their anger perfect
                  fury.</p>
               <p>As the menacing thunder reverberated, the ladies of the Governor's family rose to
                  their feet with irrepressible terror. Trembling like aspens—pale, fear-stricken,
                  overwhelmed—they looked toward the door, and awaited a repetition of the
                  sound.</p>
               <p>Their panic was shared by the Governor. His courage seemed to give way, his cheek
                  grew pale, and turning toward the man whom he had just insulted, he faltered
                  out,</p>
               <p>"These people will tear us to pieces!"</p>
               <p>St. John looked away from the speaker with a curl of the lip which he could not
                  repress; his gaze fell upon the ladies, and he saw Lady Augusta, the friend of
                  Blossom, gazing into his face, with so helpless and beseeching a glance, that his
                  heart melted in his breast.</p>
               <p>"Fear nothing, madam," he said, replying in words to the look, and bowing with
                  grace and ceremonious courtesy; "the men of Virginia do not make war on women. I
                  will preserve you from insult with my life, if that is necessary."</p>
               <p>And turning to the Governor,</p>
               <p>"I place myself wholly at your Excellency orders," he said, "and I think that the
                  ladies should leave the palace."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes! and I, too, sir! I, too, will go! I will no longer remain where my life
                  is threatened!"</p>
               <p>The young man did not wait for more. He rushed through<pb n="482-483"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000242"/> the palace to the stables, with his drawn sword,
                  compelled the terrified servants to attach the horses to the chariot; in ten
                  minutes it stood at the rear entrance of the palace.</p>
               <p>The ladies were ready with a few hastily-gathered jewels and articles of clothing,
                  and quickly got in with the Governor.</p>
               <p>Lady Augusta entered last, and St. John long remembered the sweet look of
                  gratitude which she bestowed upon him.</p>
               <p>"Thanks, Mr. St. John," she said, hurriedly pressing his hand; "you are truly a
                  gentleman. We may never meet again, but I will always remember you!"</p>
               <p>And, whether by design or accident, she dropped one of her small gloves at his
                  feet, which he raised and placed in his bosom, with a low bow of thanks and
                  farewell.</p>
               <p>The door closed—the coachman, trembling with fear, lashed his terrified horses;
                  they started at a gallop, and the chariot disappeared at the moment when another
                  roar shook the palace.</p>
               <p>St. John hastened to the great gateway—saw a wild, terrible tumult—was mounted,
                  and spurring his animal into the meleé, before he knew it, almost, the guards of
                  the Governor had charged the crowd.</p>
               <p>The veins of the young man seemed to fill with fire instead of blood; his eyes
                  blazed with indignation as the trampling troopers bore down on the unarmed mass;
                  his sword flashed in the sun, and digging the spur into the quivering sides of his
                  animal, he rushed upon Captain Foy, who, raging like a wild beast at bay, led the
                  guards in their charge.</p>
               <p>But suddenly another adversary was opposed to Foy—an adversary who cried, as his
                  horse reeled through the mass,</p>
               <p>"Now for the Coup of Reinfels!"</p>
               <p>Then St. John saw, raised above the heads of the crowd, two men clash together
                  with a noise like thunder—two swords gleamed aloft—the combatants grappled, as it
                  were, for an instant, breast to breast, face to face, and then, as the sudden
                  blast of a trumpet, and the sound of galloping horses resounded from the other end
                  of Gloucester street, the combat came to its termination. Captain Waters rose
                  erect, with his hat slashed in two, and the blood flowing from a slight wound in
                  his temple; Captain Foy dropped his saber, and turning deadly pale, fell forward
                  on the neck of his horse. His opponent's weapon had passed through his body.</p>
               <p>The trumpet and galloping horses announced a company from the county of James
                  City, and they came on now with shouts and cries; the guards were seen to waver
                  and fall back. When it was known that their captain, Foy, was disabled, they lost
                  heart, and looked around in despair. Then finally, as the horsemen swept on, they
                  recoiled and fled, with a last look toward the palace, from which they seemed to
                  have expected succor. The chariot of the Governor was seen ascending, at full
                  gallop, a distant hill, and in that direction they now directed their flight,
                  pursued by the victorious shouts of their enemies.</p>
               <p>Foy glared at his adversary for an instant, like a wounded wolf, with
                  indescribable hatred and rage; his dark eyes burned like coals in his pallid face,
                  and he gnashed his teeth with a sort of helpless fury. Then turning his horse's
                  head, and shaking his clenched hand at his enemies, with a last exertion of
                  strength, he dug the spur into his horse and fled reeling. His unconquerable
                  spirit seemed to supply him with strength to remain in the saddle. His black horse
                  darted onward on the heels of the rest—the flying hoofs resounded for some moments
                  on the stones—then, bearing away his faint and reeling rider, the wild animal
                  disappeared from all eyes.</p>
               <p>As Foy thus vanished, an immense roar of victory resounded, and borne on by the
                  tumultuous and shouting multitude, St. John found himself suddenly by the side of
                  the commander of the reinforcement. It was the stranger. But no longer the
                  stranger of the past, in his plain citizen's accoutrements—the man of the pen. It
                  was now the man of the sword. His belt was filled with pistols, a long broad-sword
                  clashed against his heavy boots; with his white<pb n="484-485"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000243"/> and nervous hand, as supple and hard as steel, he
                  reined in the fiery and plunging animal which he rode with a grasp of iron.</p>
               <p>His pale face was slightly flushed, his lips compressed with icy resolution, his
                  dark, haunting eyes, blazed with a steady flame.</p>
               <p>As his horse and that of St. John came in collision, the young man found his hand
                  enclosed in the vice-like grasp of the stranger's.</p>
               <p>"We meet again, friend," said the stranger, in his collected voice, which sounded
                  low and clearly in the midst of the immense tumult; "I told you that events were
                  ripening—that the storm rushed on. We 'll see now! it has come! hear its thunder!
                  You will soon see its lightning!"</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied St. John, gazing with absorbing interest at the pale martial face,
                  "yes! the <emph>tongue</emph> and the <emph>pen</emph> are about to yield—to yield
                  to the sword, as you said."</p>
               <p>"They have yielded! They disappear!" cried the stranger, with a glance of fiery
                  joy and pride. "We have found what we wanted—the <emph>sword!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"You have found it? found the leader?"</p>
               <p>"Yes! the man who will lead us to glory and victory! He is already elected general
                  in chief of the armies of North America!"</p>
               <p>"His name?"</p>
               <p>"George Washington!"</p>
               <p>As though in response to the utterance of the name, a deafening cheer rose above
                  the multitude, making the horses start and rear.</p>
               <p>The flag of St. George—the banner of England—which had waved above the magazine,
                  was seen to drop. Then, obeying the strength of the hundred hands which caught the
                  ropes, it slowly descended, amid the shouts of the great crowd.</p>
               <p>In an instant it had disappeared. It was trampled beneath the feet of the roaring
                  multitude, and torn into a thousand shreds.</p>
               <p>"Look, friend!" cried the stranger, with glowing eyes, "see the banner of England
                  trodden down and torn to pieces! See the beginning of the end! the advent of war
                  and revolution! The hour has struck! the day dawned! The old world has passed
                  away—behold all things from henceforth become new!"</p>
               <p>The triumphal roar of cannon seemed to reply to the words—the Revolution had
                  indeed begun.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XC.</head>
               <head type="sub">A SUMMER DAY AT "FLOWER OF HUNDREDS."</head>
               <p>WITH the scenes which have just been narrated our history might very well end, but
                  perhaps by so terminating it, we should leave too much to the imagination of the
                  reader.</p>
               <p>We shall therefore add a few words in relation to Mr. St. John, the family at
                  Vanely, and some other personages of the history.</p>
               <p>The stranger had not used the money which the young man deposited in his hands
                  "for the cause." He never for a moment had any such intention, and soon after the
                  departure of St. John for the Indian wars, had entrusted the entire sum to Colonel
                  Vane, with a statement of the circumstances under which he had received it.</p>
               <p>The old gentleman had been ignorant of the young man's return to Williamsburg,
                  Bonnybel having never spoken of their meeting at the graveyard, and thus there had
                  been no communication between the two gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Soon after the flight of Dunmore, however, and when St. John went again to Vanely,
                  and dissipated with a word the long misunderstanding, the old gentleman returned
                  the twenty thousand pounds, and in the presence of the young man, burned, smiling,
                  the deed by which he had conveyed<pb n="486-487" xml:id="VAC6146-00000244"/> to
                  Colonel Vane all his servants. One thing only remained to be done—to repurchase
                  "Flower of Hundreds" from Mr. Smith, the factor—and in this St. John did not
                  experience any difficulty. The worthy factor was quite content to receive back the
                  money, with interest, having found that residing at "Flower of Hundreds" was
                  neither in consonance with his habits, which were those of a town-dweller, or his
                  interests, which made his presence necessary in Williamsburg. The young man,
                  therefore, found himself reinstated in his family mansion—the owner again of his
                  patrimonial acres, as though he had never left them, or parted with them.</p>
               <p>We need scarcely say that the cloud which had obscured his relations with Bonnybel
                  had wholly disappeared. Perhaps they loved each other even more dearly than before
                  for the woful misunderstanding which had taken place. There was now no obstacle to
                  their union, and they were accordingly married in the autumn of the same year. Two
                  other marriages took place on the same evening at Vanely. Miss Seraphina gave her
                  hand to the inconsolable widower, Jack Hamilton, whose business at Vanely now lay
                  with the lady—no longer with Colonel Vane. And Helen rewarded the long and
                  persevering suit of honest Tom Alston, whose "shaking" had at last brought down
                  the fruit.</p>
               <p>On the same morning Mr. St. John had been invited to the wedding of James
                  Doubleday, Esq., who was about to espouse the lady for whom he had only a
                  "Platonic regard," and we may add that there were present at Vanely, in the party
                  of Captain Waters and his wife, who possessed but a single failing, two young
                  people who, perhaps, looked forward to the day upon which they, also, would be
                  married.</p>
               <p>These young persons were Paul Effingham, Esq., son and heir of Champ Effingham,
                  Esq., of Effingham Hall, and Miss Beatrice Waters, otherwise called Blossom,
                  daughter of Charles Waters, Esq.</p>
               <p>"The son of Champ and the daughter of Beatrice!" murmured the captain, as his
                  shoulders drooped and his eyes grew dreamy; "what a singular world!"</p>
               <p>At the door, on a chair set for her, was Mammy Liza; and, when the ceremony was
                  over, Bonnybel went to her and put her arms around her neck and kissed her. It is
                  the fashion in our country, gentle reader.</p>
               <p>So the festival passed, with its joy, and merriment, and uproar, and bright eyes,
                  and smiles, and true love was rewarded.</p>
               <p>St. John did not remain many days with his bride. He again girt on his sword,
                  exchanged his buckled shoes for heavy horseman's boots, and went to join the
                  troops that were marching against Dunmore. He was present at the battle of "Great
                  Bridge," where the raw volunteers of Virginia defeated the grenadiers of a crack
                  English regiment, at the burning of Norfolk, and at the terrible tragedy of
                  "Gwynn's Island," from which, driven by General Andrew Lewis, the victor at "Point
                  Pleasant," and now arrayed against him who had endeavored to betray him, Lord
                  Dunmore, abandoning his mercenaries and armed slaves, took flight, leaving thus,
                  happily for ever, the soil of the land which he had tried to enslave.</p>
               <p>St. John fought throughout the Revolution, and was known to enjoy the confidence
                  and warm personal regard of the friend of Colonel Vane, the great leader of the
                  armies of America. He only visited his estates in Virginia occasionally; but,
                  after Yorktown, returned thither to go away no more. The sun-burnt soldier hung up
                  his sword on the wall of "Flower of Hundreds," and sank back to the place of a
                  Virginia planter.</p>
               <p>Need we say that a beautiful face appeared at the door as the aged "Tallyho"
                  neighed joyfully at the great gate?—that a form flitted, rather than ran, over the
                  emerald grass, and, in an instant, was weeping in the arms of the soldier? and
                  soon his knees were clasped by two little urchins with sunny curls, and a lovely
                  child, fast ripening into beautiful girlhood, threw her arms around his neck, and
                  sobbed for joy upon his bosom.</p>
               <p>St. John reentered the familiar old hall in the midst of<pb n="488-489"
                     xml:id="VAC6146-00000245"/> a joyful pæan from a multitude of Africans with
                  grinning and delighted faces; and then the old chariot from Vanely was descried
                  ascending the hill, the day of his return having been announced in a letter. The
                  honest old colonel limped forth with grimaces and warmly pressed the hand of the
                  young man. Old Cato did the same with evident satisfaction, and good Aunt Mabel
                  placed her thin arms around him and gave him a kiss and her blessing.</p>
               <p>They were happy in the cheerful old mansion, thus reunited, and we leave them as
                  we found them—smiling.</p>

               <head type="sub">BY THE AUTHOR OF THE MS.</head>
               <p>SO it ends, my simple old chronicle; my poor dimcolored picture of the men and
                  women, habitudes and costumes of the days of the Revolution.</p>
               <p>'Twas an unknown land, and a forgotten generation which I attemped to describe;
                  the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">terra incognita</foreign> of <emph>old</emph>
                  Virginia; the race of giants, looming now, as it were, through mists, or the smoke
                  of battle; the race which played such a great and noble part in the drama of those
                  days which tried men's souls.</p>
               <p>I wished my pages to embody, if that were possible, some of the secret influences
                  which bore on great events—to paint the humble and unnoted source of the great
                  stream of revolution, ever increasing, and, at last, overthrowing all which stood
                  before it. To paint, too, the gallant youths and lovely maidens—their gay love
                  encounters, in the old, old, days—their sorrows and joys—their sighs and their
                  laughter—their whispering voices, heard still, as we read the yellow old letters
                  of the far away Past! What is it that comes up before the page as we read? Is it a
                  ghostly laughter, a glimmer of bright eyes, a beautiful shadow of something
                  flitting and impalpable, as delicate as a reverie or dream? I read the dim words,
                  and lay down the sheet, and think, with smiles, of the gallant protestations of
                  gallants long dead—as dead as the maidens whom they toasted long ago. Damon is
                  gone this many a day, and Celinda sleeps with the roses. The Philanders and
                  Strephons, the Mays and the Cynthias are "white as their smocks," or their
                  ruffles—and so cold!</p>
               <p>Whither have you flown, O maidens of a dead generation? There was a time when you
                  smiled and sighed; when your frowns or your laughter plunged the gallants into
                  misery or exuberant delight. Will you come no more back if we call to you, and
                  sigh for you? Will you still remain silent and cold when we adjure you?</p>
               <p>Alas! yes. For you are the stars of another generation. It is fourscore years
                  since you shone in the skies—you will shine no more to the eyes of mortals. You
                  have crumbled to dust beneath emerald sward; from your white maiden breasts grow
                  flowers. You played your merry parts beneath the old colonial skies, and then went
                  away to heaven; and now we, your descendants, in another age, read of your happy
                  faces with such pensive smiles—ponder so wistfully, as we follow the old story—the
                  story which chronicles the beauty and goodness of the dear, dead maidens of the
                  Past!</p>
               <p>But I am dreaming. I look on the landscape from my shady old porch, and only see
                  the faces of Bonnybel and her lover—of Blossom, and Tom Alston, and Kate
                  Effingham. I linger still in the haunted domain of my memory, or my fancy, if it
                  please you. I press the warm hands, hear the musical voices; but they die away as
                  I listen. The colors all fade—the laughter is hushed—no more the gay jest rings
                  careless and free—'t is a company of ghosts which I gaze at; fading away into
                  mist.</p>
               <p>A glimmer—a murmur—they are gone!</p>

                  <p>To-night another illumination makes the new capital of Virginia blaze. The one
                     hundred and twenty-sixth birth-day of a member of the House of Burgesses, whose
                     eyes beheld the scene we have described, has been heralded and welcomed with
                     the roar of cannon, and the shouts of a great nation. To-day the equestrian
                     Washington of Crawford was uncovered, and greeted with that acclaim which<pb
                        n="492-493" xml:id="VAC6146-00000247"/> hails the great work of a great
                     genius. The member of the Burgesses—Colonel Washington, from Fairfax—is, in
                     history, and men's hearts and memories, the foremost man of all this world. His
                     Excellency Lord Dunmore is forgotten, or remembered only for contempt. So time

                  <p>A gentleman profoundly read in the private history, so to speak, of the
                     Revolution, stated to us, not long since, that nothing had astonished him more,
                     in the course of his researches, than the extraordinary quickness and fidelity
                     of the <emph>expresses</emph> at this period. The post was slow and unreliable,
                     but news was widely and expeditiously disseminated in spite of the fact. In a
                     letter from R. K. Meade to General Everard Meade, his brother, dated April,
                     '75, the writer says that the intelligence of the battle of Lexington has just
                     come from Boston, "by an express who must almost have flown."</p>

                     volume, are heightened in brilliancy by the fancy of the writer. To show that
                     the sketches are truthful, a curious description of an elaborate painting of
                     Washington's wedding is appended. The writer declares that the main figures are
                     taken from "the original pictures of Colonel and Mrs. Washington, the one of
                     the date of 1772, by Peale, and the other of 1759, by Woolaston," and then
                     proceeds:</p>

                     officiating clergyman, in full canonicals; he is about to present the marriage
                     ring. The bridegroom is in a suit of blue and silver, lined with red
                     silk—embroidered waistcoat—small clothes—gold shoe and knee buckles—dress
                     sword—hair in full powder. The bride in a suit of white satin—rich point-faced
                     ruffles—pearl ornaments in her hair—pearl necklace, ear-rings and
                     bracelets—white satin high-heeled shoes, with diamond buckles. She is attended
                     by a group of ladies, in the gorgeous costume of that ancient period. Near to
                     the bridegroom is a brilliant group, comprising the vice-regal Governor of
                     Virginia, several English army and navy officers, then on colonial service,
                     with the very elite of Virginia chivalry of the old regime. The Governor is in
                     a suit of scarlet, embroidered with gold, with bag wig and sword—the gentlemen
                     in the fashion of the time.</p>
                  <p>"But among the most interesting and picturesque of the personages in the
                     various groups is Bishop, the celebrated body servant of Braddock, and then of
                     Washington, with whom he ended his days, after service of more than forty
                     years.</p>
                  <p>"This veteran soldier of the wars of George II. forms a perfect study in the
                     picture. His tall, attenuated form and soldierly bearing, as with folded arms,
                     and cocked hat in hand, respectfully he approaches the bridal group, gives a
                     touching interest to the whole scene. He is in a scarlet coat, and is booted
                     and spurred, having just dismounted, and relinquished the favorite charger of
                     his chief to a groom. Through the large folding doors of the church is seen the
                     old-fashioned coach of the bride, drawn by six horses, also the fine English
                     charger bequeathed to Washington by Braddock, after the fatal field of the
                     Monongahela. From the account of the marriage, handed down from those that were
                     present at its celebration, it appears that the bride and her ladies occupied
                     the coach, while the provincial colonel rode his splendid charger, attended by
                     a brilliant cortege of the gay and gallant of the land. Such was Washington's
                     marriage in 1759."</p>
                  <p>This splendor, in costume and personal adornment, remained unchanged up to the
                     time of the Revolution. Dress then shared the change in every thing else.</p>

                     the Revolution. . . . His eloquence was peculiar, if indeed it should be called
                     eloquence, for it was impressive and sublime beyond what can be imagined. On
                     one or two occasions I have seen him angry and his anger was terrible; those
                     who witnessed it were not disposed to rouse it again. . . . After all, it must
