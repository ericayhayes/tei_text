CHAPTER I.&#xD;
THE STUDENT.&#xD;
N a low vaulted chamber, in the upper story of an humble&#xD;
building, situated in a disreputable section of the far-famed&#xD;
queen of the Adriatic, sat a youth of sogne three and twenty&#xD;
years. A low, broad, cross-legged table was before him, on&#xD;
..-which, in careless disorder, some ten or twenty volumes,&#xD;
bound in parchment, and ornamented with metal clasps,&#xD;
were scattered. Sheets of unstained parchment, lay here and&#xD;
there, while directly before him was a sheet half filled with&#xD;
annotations, dates, &amp;amp;c,, apparently for reference. A saucer&#xD;
of brass, containing a dark liquid, rested within a few inches&#xD;
of the dotted parchment, while a long gray quill, cut at the&#xD;
tip, and stained with writing fluid, lay on the edge of the&#xD;
table, as if just put down. The youth leaned backward in&#xD;
his low-seated but high-backed Chair, his right hand sup-&#xD;
porting his pale, high brow, while his left hung listlessly&#xD;
over the cross-piece of his chair. The features of the youth&#xD;
were more of the feminine than of the masculine cast, the&#xD;
forehead being high and pale, the eye dark, lustrous, yet&#xD;
soft and melting, the cheek pale, the eyebrow arching, the&#xD;

were of a russet hue, and ornamented with the student, with increased agitation, ' 1-1&#xD;

Count Foscari, and tell him, all potent as he&#xD;
is, there is another man in Venice,-one&#xD;
Count De Galliano,-who will overthrow&#xD;
him and the " Ten."  Tell him this, and&#xD;
tell him too, that a plot is now afoot, to&#xD;
drive all tyrants from the soil of Venice, and&#xD;
that Count Galliano is at its head. Tell&#xD;
him, too, that we meet to-morrow night, in&#xD;
the vault of St. Mark's, and that our watch-&#xD;
word is-' The Orange Girl of Venice'.'&#xD;
The student uttered a cry of recognition,&#xD;
and fell on his knees before the stranger.&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
THE    GONDOLIER.&#xD;
On the day following the incidents in the&#xD;
preceding chapter, a nobleman approached&#xD;
a group of gondoliers, who were rattling&#xD;
dice,'on a little round table, in front of a low&#xD;
hostel, which stood in a-long, broad street&#xD;
leading from the grand square of St. Mark's,&#xD;
and fronting the sea. Small heaps of cop-&#xD;
per coin lay here and there upon the table;&#xD;
and it was evident, from the excited features&#xD;
of the players that the stakes, to them, were&#xD;
of an unusually large amount. One face&#xD;
alone of the party evinced but little symp.&#xD;
toms of excitement, although, to the deep&#xD;
observer, there was more meaning, more&#xD;
real language, to be detected in his passion-&#xD;
less features than in those of his more frothy,&#xD;
and more talkative companions. His eyes&#xD;
were large, dark, lustrous and full; his fore-&#xD;
head high, his hair thrown back, and falling&#xD;
in careless disorder adown his swarthy, sun-&#xD;
burnt neck ; liis nose was Roman in its&#xD;
shape, with the nostrils wide and heavy, de-&#xD;
noting the deep, fearless, and violent nature&#xD;
of their owner; his chin was bold, pointed,&#xD;
and covered with a heavy tuft of black and&#xD;
glossy hair: a heavy mustache covered his&#xD;
firm, upper lip, and his thick, bull-like throat&#xD;
was exposed to the effects of the sun and&#xD;
atmosphere from the shoulders upward. He&#xD;
wore a loose, red shirt, with a broad, ruin-&#xD;
pled collar; the sleeves rolled up to the el-&#xD;
bow, revealing a pair of siout, muscular, sun-&#xD;
burnt arms, which seemed to bid defiance to&#xD;
the best stalwart compeer in the struggle for&#xD;
gondolier or wrestling fame. Yellow shoes,&#xD;
blue trousers, fitting tightly to the skin, a&#xD;
rough, short, canvass frock, just reaching to&#xD;
the knees, and a leathern belt, with an enor-&#xD;
mous steel buckle in the front, completed the&#xD;
gondolier's attire. His height was slightly&#xD;
above the commonrand his figure, as lie half&#xD;
stcod by, and half sat on, the edge of the&#xD;
&#xD;
rude table, displayed a suppleness and mus-&#xD;
cularity of limb not often found among the&#xD;
everyday tenants of this habitable house, the&#xD;
world. The garb of his companions was sim-&#xD;
ilar to that of the bold gondolier, with the ex-&#xD;
ception that, in general, his habiliments&#xD;
seemed tidier and cleanlier than theirs.&#xD;
The master of the inn stood at the door,&#xD;
smoking his long, reed-like pipe, apparently&#xD;
with great satisfaction. Ever and anon, he&#xD;
cast his eyes furtively upon the gamesters,&#xD;
as if watching the progress of their games;&#xD;
and, at each result of the 'last throw,' a&#xD;
sickly, sarcastic smile would play around his&#xD;
mouth, revealing a set of teeth which seem-&#xD;
ed inade to contrast, in their whiteness, with&#xD;
his dark and swarthy complexion. Judging&#xD;
him by his appearance, lie could not have&#xD;
been far from five-and-forty years of age.&#xD;
He wore an apron, of coarse, dirty muslin,&#xD;
and looked every inch the landlord of 'the&#xD;
inn of St. 1Vary's.' A stout, ill-favored&#xD;
knave lie seemed, and though, wliilesmok-&#xD;
ing, he' paid, apparently, but little attention&#xD;
to 4he oaths and other exclamations of&#xD;
triumph or disappointment of those at the&#xD;
table, still a keen observer could easily have&#xD;
seen that not a word escaped his ear, or a&#xD;
gesture of the gondoliers his eye.&#xD;
As the noble approached, two or three of&#xD;
the gamesters threw down their dice, and,&#xD;
running towards him, proffered tbeir'services&#xD;
to row him out into the Lagoon, 'if it was&#xD;
the noble Signior's pleasure.'&#xD;
Passing them by unnoticed,,the noble mo-&#xD;
tioned the stout gondolier alr eady described,&#xD;
to jump into his boat. The latte'r, with a&#xD;
.respectful silence, sprang into his gondola,&#xD;
which lay moored beside a small flight of&#xD;
landing stairs, directly in front of the hostel.&#xD;
The noble followed slowly, an d took his&#xD;
seat in the stern with a dignity which im-&#xD;
pressed the group on shore witian awe they&#xD;
could scarcely banish, even when the fleet&#xD;
bark had rounded the quay.&#xD;
'Lie to,' said the noble, when the boat had&#xD;
reached the centre of the Lagoon. 'Dost&#xD;
know me?'&#xD;
'I knew thee at the first,'replied the gon-&#xD;
dolier, resting on his oars.&#xD;
'How speeds the cause?' demanded the&#xD;
noble, in a low voice.&#xD;
' Bravely, my lord: the innkeeper, Marco,&#xD;
bath a daring and patriotic heart. He hath&#xD;
gold, too, and will loan it to the cause, with.&#xD;
out interest.'&#xD;
'Good! and the rest?'&#xD;
'They wear their dirks in their bosoms,&#xD;
'twixt their flesh and shirts. Three hundred&#xD;
of them, as brave hearts as ever pulled oar&#xD;
or wielded knife, are-ready to march a: word&#xD;
of mine. When do we strikeI?'&#xD;
'That will be determined to-night. I&#xD;
think 'twill be on Carnival night : though I&#xD;
speak without authority. The number of&#xD;
men we can surely count on?'&#xD;
- 'Three hundred.&#xD;

'And all determined?'&#xD;
'Every one, my lord.'&#xD;
'Speak lower, and title me not,' said'the&#xD;
rioble, leaning forward in his seat. 'Since&#xD;
I have been travelling for assistance to our&#xD;
cause, I have learned that water and air&#xD;
nave listening ears and tell-tale tongues, as&#xD;
well as dungeon or cavern walls. Why,-&#xD;
man, the elements around us are witnesses&#xD;
to our speech ; and strange things are told&#xD;
of how the "Ten" have made even the&#xD;
waters, aye, and the floating atmosphere&#xD;
creatures of their will. Therefore, lest our&#xD;
voices betray us, speak thou in whispers:&#xD;
the Lagoon,. though broad and deep, hath,&#xD;
ere now, been the doom of many a votary of&#xD;
its bosom. Remember the fate of De Gama,&#xD;
and title me not.-The "Ten" are every&#xD;
where.'&#xD;
' Were it not better I should row about?'&#xD;
said the gondolier, in a low tone. 'If we&#xD;
should be watched from the shore, by any&#xD;
of the spirits of the Tribunal:-'&#xD;
' Right,' replied the noble, 'row on-but&#xD;
guide her farther from the shore.'&#xD;
' What successfrom abroad?' inquired the&#xD;
gondolier, slowly pulling outward.&#xD;
'None,' responded the other; '.we must&#xD;
depend upon ourrolvee ~ Physicnl help e&#xD;
hopeless ;'although, in one shape, it is cer-&#xD;
tain. I have raised twelve thousand ducats,&#xD;
in sound yellow coin, from certain citizens&#xD;
in Rome, Verona and Cyprus, which now&#xD;
lies in a 1cocner of the vault of St. Mark's: it&#xD;
will be shown to-night, at our meeting.'&#xD;
'Gold may do much,' observed the gon-&#xD;
dolier, meaningly.&#xD;
' It will rouse the heart-s of the desponding,&#xD;
if any be among us, when convened,' said the&#xD;
noble, quickly; 'for, to the vulgar mind,&#xD;
there is a power, yea, an eloquence, irresis-&#xD;
tible in a sack of shining dross. But be that&#xD;
as it may, we have a doom even for the&#xD;
weak-hearted.'&#xD;
'Ave-the cord-and knife!' observed the&#xD;
gondolier, with a slight curl of the.lip.&#xD;
Pah ! 'tis too like the " Ten."'.&#xD;
' Can they be dispensed with?' demanded&#xD;
the noble, quickly.&#xD;
'They can,' replied the gondolier, impe-&#xD;
tuously.&#xD;
'How?' said the-noble, earnestly.&#xD;
'By depending on the honor of all who&#xD;
choose not to proceed,' responded the gon-&#xD;
*lolier.&#xD;
' Psha ! you know not men!' exclaimed&#xD;
the noble,' hastily.  '\When men league&#xD;
themselves together for a mighty work,&#xD;
there must be a fear held out to bind them&#xD;
to be true. Else doubts and fears as to the&#xD;
success of the enterprise, would be the fore-&#xD;
runners only to desertions and betrayal. Men&#xD;
are not all true, all brave ; and the weak&#xD;
nerved must be held in check, must be kept&#xD;
true, by the known brave, and the known&#xD;
true, beside them: which latter failing, there&#xD;
m-t be a doom for apostates, which they&#xD;
&#xD;
IRL OF VENICE.&#xD;
must fear, to keep them true. D or great&#xD;
ends, we must not scruple to employ small&#xD;
means. And what end, what enterprise&#xD;
more glorious, than the freeing of one's&#xD;
country from a horde .of villains that make&#xD;
all fear ! They scruple not to shed our blood,&#xD;
they scruple not to tear away from life, on&#xD;
most trivial and uncertain causes, too, those&#xD;
they deem dangerous to themselves or to&#xD;
their power-and should we risk our lives,&#xD;
the lives of all united with us, by sparing&#xD;
one, who, knowing all our secrets, would&#xD;
depart on dastardly excuse, and peril the&#xD;
safety of us all ? No; once colleagued, we&#xD;
must not risk our enterprise and lives at the&#xD;
soft voice of mercy. We aim for freedom&#xD;
and for life-perpetual freedom, and life's&#xD;
life-not for one, but all-high and low, the&#xD;
wealthy and the low born: and such an acme&#xD;
were rashly endangered, to spare a craven's&#xD;
life, for sake of mercy!'&#xD;
'1 fear not betrayal,' observed the gon-&#xD;
dolier, prouely.&#xD;
' Nor I,' replied the noble, 'while we&#xD;
have a doom for traitors. But, enough of&#xD;
this. I called, last night, on our spy, in the&#xD;
eastern section. Would'st believe it-he&#xD;
knew me not "'&#xD;
'Ha . not know thee!' exclaimed the-gon-&#xD;
dolier, leaning foryrard on his oars. 'Has&#xD;

' In good faith! not he,' replied the noble,&#xD;
'It was my beard and face and dress he&#xD;
knew not.'&#xD;
' By St. Mark ! I feared something els? !'&#xD;
said the gondolier, half smiling. ' What&#xD;
number reports he ready for the trial-hour ?&#xD;
' Four hundred and twelve,' answered the&#xD;
noble.-' Their names are registered on&#xD;
parchment. Ii truth, that same student is&#xD;
a brave worker: his parchments contain the&#xD;
names of every member of our order, in&#xD;
characters as plain and bold as ever came&#xD;
frbin the hand of man. Our constitution&#xD;
and our-laws, our rewards and penalties-&#xD;
the progress of our order, and its history-&#xD;
the causes 6f our existence-the wrongs we&#xD;
have suffered, the injuries forborne-in fine,&#xD;
-our- order's whole history,-are traced in&#xD;
characters of truth, upon his parchments..&#xD;
His daily journal keeps lie: of the proselytes&#xD;
made, wrongs suffered, the day-and hour of&#xD;
the deed, and the names of the wronged and&#xD;
the wrongers. A terrible history of life lies&#xD;
in those parchments; a terrible history of&#xD;
blood, lust, murder and oppression, which&#xD;
cries aloud to heaven for vengeance.'&#xD;
' And it wMl come, ere long!' exclainqed&#xD;
the gondolier, with a savage smile.&#xD;
'Aye, it will,' cried the noble, in a deep&#xD;
tone, though without stirring a hair, -'1it&#xD;
will--aye, it shail '!-and when it does, wo,&#xD;
wo to the doers of aark deeds ! wo to the&#xD;
Tribunal ! wo to the " Teti!"'&#xD;

the gondolier, slowly pulling his oars.&#xD;

the vestibules, the gardens, -streets and&#xD;

with fantastically arrayed gondolas, from&#xD;
which arose the ripe, rich voices of the gay&#xD;
young roysterers and cavaliers in melodious&#xD;
song; while from others, the flute and gui-&#xD;

up and down the gravelled walks of P private&#xD;

&#xD;
For shame on thee-! that one so highly&#xD;
born-an orphan, too !-should think so&#xD;
lightly of her honor 'as to permit the free&#xD;
addresses of a known libertine and -'&#xD;
'Stn thy dastard tongue V' exclaimed the&#xD;
lady Isabel, starting up, and pointing the&#xD;
old man to the door,-' whoe'er thou art-&#xD;
whate'er thine errand-I care not! Begone!'&#xD;
'Lady-'&#xD;
'Not a word! This house-this roof is&#xD;

mine own roof, no low-born hind, nor crea-&#xD;
ture of birth or power, shall assail mine ear&#xD;
with insolence, or bravado. Begone!'&#xD;
The old man leaned upon his cane, be-&#xD;
tween her and the door, his feathered cap&#xD;
hanging in his left hand, and his eyes gleam-&#xD;
ing maliciously and sharply at the fair&#xD;
speaker as she stood, stern, bold and erect,&#xD;
her finger pointing to the door.&#xD;
.rady, I am here for a purpose,' said he,&#xD;
in a I w, soft voice, and with a smile which&#xD;
was an index to his nature, 'I am here for&#xD;
a purpose, and till it be accomplished, thy&#xD;
threshold shall calmly await my inclination&#xD;
to cross it.'&#xD;
'What ho, Martino!' exclaimed Isabel,&#xD;
loudly, and ringing a silver bell which rest-&#xD;
ed on the circular table, 'what ho, MartinoI&#xD;
thy mistress needs thy help!'&#xD;
The object of her wrath, smifing, quietly&#xD;
resumed his seat.&#xD;
A hurried stop was heard in the entry-&#xD;
the door opened hastily, and a young servi-&#xD;
tor, of some seven and twenty years, entered&#xD;
the apartment.&#xD;
' The matter lady !' he exclaimed, burri-&#xD;
adly and bowing. '&#xD;
'Turn yon hoary wretch from out my&#xD;
doors !' she cried, pointing to her visitor."&#xD;
The eyes of the servitor and the old man&#xD;
met-a hasty sign from the latter, unobserv-&#xD;
ed by the lady isabel, but which the sharp&#xD;
eye of the servitor detected, silenced the lat-&#xD;
ter, and caused his cheek to blanch to the&#xD;
hue of ashes.&#xD;
'L eave us,' said the old man, in a calm&#xD;
and silvery tone.&#xD;
Without a word-without an ugraised&#xD;
look-without a glance at his astonished&#xD;
mistress, the servitor bowed, and, his eyei&#xD;
resting upon the carl)et, slowly retired from&#xD;
the apartment.&#xD;
Isabel looked after him in astonishment.&#xD;
' Thou seest the engines of thy house,&#xD;
observed the old man, sardonically, 'thou&#xD;
seest the faith of its small pillars!'&#xD;
The lady Isabel heeded himnot, but clasp&#xD;
ing her hand to her forehead, staggered&#xD;
pale and ghastly, to a cushion, and san.i&#xD;
upon it speechless.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
The sun was playing through the case&#xD;
meant when the lady Isabel awoke, and th&#xD;
hum of voices mingled with the winds. Sh&#xD;
&#xD;
looked round. . The door was closed; and,&#xD;
save herself, no human thing breathed in'the&#xD;
chamber. The apartment seemed smaller&#xD;
than usual, and the drapery around the walls&#xD;
seemed darker than on the preceding day.&#xD;
A large and heavy lock was on the door too;&#xD;
and the door itself had changed its color&#xD;
since yester-night. The entire aspect of the&#xD;
Apartment seemed changed. A picture-a&#xD;
small one-hung between the windows,&#xD;
which she could not recollect. She sprang&#xD;
up, and advanced towards it--she did not&#xD;
know it.-Her brow felt heated-her eyes&#xD;
weak and nervous.   She sat down on a&#xD;
cushion, and tried to think-she could not.&#xD;
A sharp pain shot athwart her brow, and&#xD;
scattered the loose leaves of her memory.&#xD;
She felt sick at heart, chilled in soul, vacant&#xD;
in mind. A phantom seemed to dance be.&#xD;
fore her-a dim and shadowy phantom-&#xD;
yet could she not give it shape: for when&#xD;
her eyes gazed intently and boldly at it, it&#xD;
vanished, and the sunbeams were before her,&#xD;
She rose, and paced the chamber, vacantly.&#xD;
Something heavy was on her heart-an iron&#xD;
weight upon her brow.-Air ! air! Her&#xD;
tongue was parched-her lips seemed glued&#xD;
together.&#xD;
'Water-water!' she muttered, unconsci&#xD;
ously.&#xD;
She paused,-her eyes riveted upon s(nar-&#xD;
row slit in the carpeted floor. It gradually&#xD;
widened, till a square hole, of some four feet,&#xD;
revealed a dark vault beneath.-She stood&#xD;
fixed, gazing into the depth, which appear.&#xD;
ed like the chasm of eternity. Presently, a&#xD;
slender and curiously carved wash-stand,&#xD;
with a snowy towel dangling at its side, rose,&#xD;
as if- by some springy pressure, and, when&#xD;
its base had reached the carpet's edge, the&#xD;
wooden floor resumed its place, and the&#xD;
stand, surmounted by a circular basin of&#xD;
brass, filled with scented water, remained&#xD;
motionless. She gazed upon it half vacantly,&#xD;
amoment ; then plunged her hand into the&#xD;
liquid and applied it to her brow. Memory&#xD;
seemed to return shadowingly, with the first&#xD;
drop of the cooling liquid, and, frantically&#xD;
seizing the towel and bathingit in the bowl,&#xD;
I she applied it to her burning brow. A sob&#xD;
I -a cry, burst from her parched lips, and she&#xD;
s sank overpowered upon the floor. As if by&#xD;
magic, the stand immediately disappeared--&#xD;
the casements darkened, and a huge torch&#xD;
rose through an opening in the floor. The&#xD;
drapery on the wall opposite the windows&#xD;
was thrown aside, and a young and magnifi-&#xD;
cently dressed cavalier entered, and raised&#xD;
- the inanimate lady in his arms. A smile&#xD;
hovered around his lips, as he gazed upon&#xD;
the fevered lip and ashy cheek of his bur-&#xD;
den. A smile-but it was not the smile of&#xD;
love, nor guilt. Raising her in -his strong&#xD;
arms, he silently and stealthily departed,&#xD;
- with his burthen, through the secret pane4&#xD;

THE ORANGE G&#xD;
&#xD;
'I watch for it, father.'&#xD;
' Watch for it! The brave heart and&#xD;
cunning mind make time, and, for revenge,&#xD;
wait not for circumstance or accident. I'll&#xD;
tell thee a tale, toy.-When I was of thine&#xD;
age, or near it, I loved thy mother. We&#xD;
were poor, both; we were young, both, we&#xD;
wesre comely, both. She had no superior in&#xD;
beauty among the haughtiest or lowliest, in&#xD;
Venice,'of her sex. For her beauty's sake,&#xD;
a young lord n ooed her-wooed her, but&#xD;
wooed her not te wed her. He dazzled her&#xD;
eyes with his gold, rank and promises. She&#xD;
was weak enough to believe that he would&#xD;
disgrace his birth, pride and rank by wedding&#xD;
a lowly craftsman's daughter ; and therefore,&#xD;
though professing much before to love me,&#xD;
discarded me. Knowing well the motives&#xD;
of the noble's visits to her cottage, I con-&#xD;
fronted him, one night, upon the Rialto, as&#xD;
he was returning from her house, and charg-&#xD;
ed him with his vile intents. He answered&#xD;
me with a look, only-a look of supercilious&#xD;
scorn-and bade me stand out of his path.&#xD;
Persons were passing at the moment, and I&#xD;
obeyed him, meekly. He passed on, with a&#xD;
loud, scornful laugh. My bldbd was up-&#xD;
but the hour had not yet come. The moon&#xD;
was up, the stars were forth, in all their&#xD;
light and beauty-it was not the hour !&#xD;
Fearful of death, he did not venture to cross&#xD;
the Rialto, again, by night, for a week;&#xD;
when, conquering his timidity, he donned&#xD;
his plume and sword and cloak, and posted&#xD;
for her house. She had been expecting him,&#xD;
and was arrayed in her most glittering and&#xD;
showv attire. She looked beautiful, and&#xD;
knew it. She stood at the door, anxiously&#xD;
awaiting his-arrival. The night was dark,&#xD;
and the streets and quays were dimly light.&#xD;
ed. Concealed behind the gate of an adjoin-&#xD;
ing house, I heard every whisper which&#xD;
passed between them. She had promised&#xD;
to become his on the ensuing night. It was&#xD;
to be a secret marriage-to be kept concealed&#xD;
at first-then gradually broached to his&#xD;
family and her's. Thou understandest the&#xD;
meaning of such a marriage, Paulo ! I heard&#xD;
it all-understood it all! My heart was ren&#xD;
with jealousy and rage, and yet I kept mv&#xD;
post, till he quitted her to return home&#xD;
Taking off my shoes, so that my footfall&#xD;
should not alarm his ear, I stealthily follow&#xD;
ed him, till lie had arrived within ten pace,&#xD;
of the Rialto. Then drawing my knife, 1&#xD;
rushed upon him, and the blade had thric&#xD;
entered his neart ere he could recover from&#xD;
his surprise. A groan-the- faint groan of&#xD;
tl e despairing-escaped his lips, and he la3&#xD;
upon the pavement, lifeless as a stone. N&#xD;
human ear save mine had heard his fall-ni&#xD;
human eye, save mine, had seen the deed&#xD;
I rolled hin-in his cloak, and dragged hin&#xD;
to the brink of the Lagoon hard by. A pil&#xD;
of stones lay near, from which I gathered&#xD;
dozen of the largest, and placed them on th&#xD;
body ; then taking a corA from my girdle&#xD;

They left the spot, together; and, ere the&#xD;

the stranger and gondolier were out of sight,&#xD;
There's more in this than I can fathom,'&#xD;
said the old man, pondering over the strange&#xD;
scene ; ' there is matter touching the State&#xD;

I've seen his face before, but where-where ?&#xD;
I cannot recall the time, or place. Some&#xD;

State needs cleaning-I've heard Paulo&#xD;
mutter it in his sleep. If lie be engaged in&#xD;
a conspiracy to sweep off all our lordly ty-&#xD;
rants--if he be !'-a strange light, like the&#xD;
enthusiastic gleam sometimes seen in the&#xD;
eyes of youth, shone in the fruit-vender's&#xD;
dark orbs--" if he be'! why, then, his fa-&#xD;

But I am old-weak--half-falling into my&#xD;
grave. No, no: I must think of other things&#xD;
than blood. The State must be cleaned by&#xD;
the Young-the down-trodden, avenged by&#xD;
the young. Old men can but preach. And&#xD;
yet, how I have wronged poor Paulo! how&#xD;
wrongly charged him!  'He watches for&#xD;
the hour'! I see it all, now-I see it all !&#xD;
How I have wronged hir !--My poor,&#xD;
,wronged daughter will yet be avenged !"&#xD;
With thoughts and mutterings like these,&#xD;
the fruit-vender hied him homeward.&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;

They walked on, the stranger and the&#xD;
gondolier. 'They kept side by side, and&#xD;
spoke in low tones. They walked on, firm-&#xD;
ly, yet nervously, as if on each step the ex-&#xD;
istence of an empire depended. The streets&#xD;
and squares and quays were now alive with&#xD;
the. young and aged, of every class, return-&#xD;
jag to their homes. The deep-toned bell of&#xD;
St. Mark's fell upon their ears, and through-&#xD;
out Venice its heavy toll warned the popu-&#xD;
lace that it lacked but an hour of midnight&#xD;

THE C RANGE GIRL OF VENICE.&#xD;
&#xD;
The moon and stars were hid. The whole&#xD;
vault of heaven was curtained with drapery,&#xD;
dark and thick and frightful. It seemed as&#xD;
if man's last hope had been cut off-as if&#xD;
Deity had drawn a sheet of darkness between&#xD;
his Throne and Earth, that hio already-of-&#xD;
fended eye might be no more offended by.&#xD;
the deeds of darkness committed by man&#xD;
upon his fellow man. Yet the elements&#xD;
were not at peace:-the winds played bo-&#xD;
peep with each other on the Lagoons and&#xD;
throughout the corners of old Venice, as if&#xD;
to frighten the few still awake, and to arouse&#xD;
to wakeful fear the thousands sleeping.&#xD;
Their wandered on, the gondolier and&#xD;
stranger. They had already traversed half&#xD;
of Venice, and yet had not reached their&#xD;
goal, if goal they had in view.&#xD;
They had neared the Rialto, still in con-&#xD;
versation earnest as when they haa first set&#xD;
out, when the watchful eye of the stranger&#xD;
discerned light  ahead. He laid his hand&#xD;
upon the arm of his companion, and, point-&#xD;
ing to the advancing torches, both noiselessly&#xD;
and cautiously drew back, and concealed&#xD;
themselves behind a broad, towering pillar&#xD;
at the base of the bridge.&#xD;
Now,' whispered the stranger to his&#xD;
companion, 'now, thou wilt see the scourge&#xD;
of our fair isle; now, thou wilt behold the&#xD;
instruments of that power, the very name&#xD;
of which makes the cheek of childhood turn&#xD;
pale, and the nerves of gay youth and stern&#xD;
manhood turn watery. Behold, but speak&#xD;
not-stir not-breathe not ; nay, utter not a&#xD;
word, though the victim be thine own sire!'&#xD;
- I will not,' said his companion.&#xD;
'Hush-they come!'&#xD;
In silence, and with slow and solemn step,&#xD;
a double file of guards, six on each side, and&#xD;
each bearing a naked, double-edged sword,&#xD;
crossed the Rialto, and passed the pillar be-&#xD;
hind which the stranger and his companion&#xD;
were concealed. In their midst, with pon-&#xD;
derous and muffled chains around his wrists,&#xD;
was a young man of some seven-and-twenty&#xD;
- ears, in the garb of a gondolier. A tall,&#xD;
alf-naked, swarthy-complexioned  slave,&#xD;
bearing a torch in one hand, guarded either&#xD;
side of the prisoner ; while before and be-&#xD;
hind the little troop marched one in the cos-&#xD;
tume of a cowled monk, with a long, white&#xD;
cross in his right hand, carried carelessly&#xD;
like a cane.     -   %&#xD;
'Ha !' exclaimed the gondolier, as his eye&#xD;
fell upon the prisoner's face, 'tis--&#xD;
But ere he could complete the sentence.the&#xD;
band of tne stranger was upon his mouin.&#xD;
The procession, witn its victim passed on,&#xD;
and, turning an angle of tne square, was&#xD;
soon lost to vieW.&#xD;
'Rash man!' exclaimed the-stranger, re-&#xD;
proachfully, 'would'st betray us?'&#xD;
j$ut the latter answered not--a film was&#xD;
before his eyes-his whole frame shook&#xD;
with terror and emotion-and he sank into&#xD;
:he arms of the stranger, speechless.&#xD;
&#xD;
The winds whistled, and the Rialto seem&#xD;
ed almost on the point of giving away before&#xD;
the violence of the gale.&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
THE STORM.&#xD;
The belfry of St. Mark's gave a solitary&#xD;
toll ; the gale swept around the old tower,&#xD;
and gave to its chime, a heavy, stern, iron-&#xD;
like sound, which seemed almost powerful&#xD;
enough to re-awake to time and being the&#xD;
tomb-sleepers of old Venice. The wail of&#xD;
the increasing gale seemed like a dirge of"&#xD;
devils over the corse of their king, in the&#xD;
royal chamber of the Shades. TheRialto&#xD;
shook as if an earthquake ivere coursing be-&#xD;
neath its foundations.&#xD;
The gale was at its height. As if the&#xD;
ministers of Deity had been ordered to level&#xD;
their several shafts at Earth and destroy it,&#xD;
the windows of heaven were opened-of -&#xD;
lightning, flash-,succeeded flash,, and peal 2&#xD;
followed peal of thunder--the rain came&#xD;
rushing down upon the seemingly-doomed&#xD;
city---and the angry blast flew around the&#xD;
squares and Lagoorn as if determined to&#xD;
make a chaos of the isle towering above the&#xD;
waters.   Mothers, with their infants in&#xD;
their arms, started cut of their beds affright-&#xD;
ed, and with their nurslings, crouched in&#xD;
corners and dark. places to hide them from&#xD;
the broad, bright flashes of the red lightning&#xD;
and the deafening roars of the booming&#xD;
thunder. Young and tender-hearted brides&#xD;
crept, shudderingly, from their couches, and&#xD;
dropped upon their knees, in prayer. Old&#xD;
men, hoary with age and crime, turned&#xD;
pale, and mumbled half-broken sentences ofR&#xD;
long-forgotten prayers. Widowed matrons,&#xD;
upon their knees, sent up supplications to&#xD;
the throne of the Most High, for sons ex-&#xD;
posed to the dangers-of the angry deep; and&#xD;
youthful and hoary monks counted their&#xD;
beads and said earnest prayers that He would&#xD;
yet spare their criminal city for repentance.&#xD;
The waters of the Lagoons were swollen&#xD;
to a fearful height, deluging ttie piers and&#xD;
streets, and sweeping off into the tide of the&#xD;
broad Adriatic every floating thing that&#xD;
came within their reach. Yet all was dark-&#xD;
ness, save when, ever and anon, the gleam&#xD;
of some fitful flash exposed the havoc of the&#xD;
storm.&#xD;
The stranger, cloaked, bent over the sense-&#xD;
less gondolier, who lay in a sitting posture,&#xD;
at the base of tne pillar, and shielded him&#xD;
from the descending rain. Though drench-&#xD;
ed to the skin, the noble cared no  for him-&#xD;
self, but had every thought cen red upon&#xD;
the peril of his companion.&#xD;
'Terror hath unnerved, unwitted him,'&#xD;
he muttered, 'and the discord and battle&#xD;
of the elements have not in them enough of&#xD;
power to wal-e him!'&#xD;

The tide rose higher, and the ncble felt and his companion, as they bent their heads&#xD;

thought, he raised the inanimate gondo- features of the latter, and a momentary tie-&#xD;
lier from his perilous position, and.dragged mor ran through his frame. He glanced at&#xD;

T11E ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE.&#xD;
&#xD;
whispered Galliano; ' we must be ghary of I&#xD;
our speech.   These villains must have&#xD;
their allotted posts, like the watchmen of&#xD;
iur city. Count the dungeon-sets we pass,&#xD;
are we again are challenged.'&#xD;
'Six,' whispered the gondolier, as soon as&#xD;
they had passed the next sentry.&#xD;
'Right, my count exactly,' said the noble,&#xD;
softly ; 'could we, now, through the dim&#xD;
light of these avenues, but learn the number&#xD;
of dungeon-squares from end to end of the&#xD;
vault, and the number of avenues, we might&#xD;
easily compute the amount of sentries at all&#xD;
times on guard here.'&#xD;
' The advantage of such knowledge?'&#xD;
'We then might guess the number of foes&#xD;
we should be likely to meet, in case we&#xD;
should storm the " Ten " in this, their den.&#xD;
I doubt much if their number is as great, as&#xD;
the prevailing fears and reports of our coun-&#xD;
trymen would lead one to imagine. Their&#xD;
great weapons are Mystery and Fear. Ve-&#xD;
netians are prone to fear an unseen power,&#xD;
and that is an all-subduing sword when&#xD;
properly handled. And yet, after all, how&#xD;
men, gifted with reasoning faculties and&#xD;
brave hearts, can be frightened by such pal-&#xD;
try bug-bears is more than I can fathom. A&#xD;
mystery is easily made up by the simplest&#xD;
mind ; the lookers-on may see the action of&#xD;
the mystery, but the mind that created it&#xD;
sees in't only the working result of his own&#xD;
mechanism ; tear away the cover, or tire&#xD;
curtain, and the gaping spectators, seeing&#xD;
the machinery, no longer wonder. These&#xD;
dungeons look m' serious and terrible, and&#xD;
yet they are nothing more than thick, wood-&#xD;
en boards put together by the aid of iron-&#xD;
nails and ordinary rivets, The head and&#xD;
bones of some poor victim are nailed upon&#xD;
them, for effect. Take away the human-&#xD;
hnman ? inhuman, rat'ier-instruments, and&#xD;
of what danger can the dumb bones and&#xD;
painted boards be? A frowning, elf-like&#xD;
visage and physique, like to the form and&#xD;
features of the last knave that challenged&#xD;
us, are easily made up by the aid of paint&#xD;
and dirt and black cloth. -They might be&#xD;
made on blocks, to frighten children with,&#xD;
and yet the scare-crow would be harmless.&#xD;
So with these knaves on duty here ; disrobe&#xD;
them of their black tunics, shave them of&#xD;
their matted beards and lanky wigs, wash&#xD;
them of their stained hands and filthy faces,&#xD;
and what would their bare forms present of&#xD;
terror more than ours? Pahi! That men&#xD;
should suffer wrongs, and let the perpetra-&#xD;
tors pass unpunished, because wrapped in&#xD;
Mystery and Paint !'&#xD;
The gondolier acknowledged the truth&#xD;
of these observations, but, though physically&#xD;
brave, he could not shake off the fears which&#xD;
his adventures among the dungeons thus far&#xD;
had gathered round him.   0&#xD;

presence of mind and courage now seented&#xD;
to shrink at he hopeless prospect before&#xD;
them.&#xD;
' Pass on to the next,' was the cool re-&#xD;
sponse-.,&#xD;
' But the sentries there may be the same&#xD;
that we have already met,' added the gon-&#xD;
dolier, falteringly.&#xD;
.' We'll make sure they are not, by taking&#xD;
our path to the one beyond. Lo ! our goal!&#xD;
see where the light gleams in yon area.'&#xD;
continued Galliano, when they had reached&#xD;
the point proposed, and pointing, as he spoke,&#xD;
to what seemed to be the entrance to the&#xD;
staircase.&#xD;
The hearts of both bounded, as they saw&#xD;
deliverance. They pressed forward, hastily,&#xD;
but on reaching the threshold of the area,&#xD;
the cheek of the gondolier blanched as if&#xD;
suddenly converted into marble-they weri&#xD;
on the threshold of the hail leading to the&#xD;
council chamber! A sentry was on duty&#xD;
there-almost before them-pacing, slowly.&#xD;
up and down the hall. His back was to-&#xD;
wards them, when they approached so near&#xD;
his post. He was about turning, when a&#xD;
sudden jerl of the gondolier, by the hand&#xD;
of Galliano, preserved both from the eyes,&#xD;
of the sentry, as he re-paced the pave by&#xD;
the door.&#xD;
'Where is thy coolness-where thine eyes,&#xD;
man !' mustered the noble, as they hurried&#xD;
itto a contiguous and dark passage.&#xD;
They had been in their copqealment scarce&#xD;
a minute, when a cavalier cloaked and mask-&#xD;
ed, and wearing a scarlet cap, shaped like a&#xD;
sugar-loaf, which was ornamented by a tall;,&#xD;
white feather, fastened by a glittering loop&#xD;
in front, passed them and entered the hall.&#xD;
. ' The password?' demanded the sentinel,&#xD;
presenting his spear.&#xD;
- The mercy of the Ten,' responded the&#xD;
cavalier, laughing.&#xD;
'Pass,' said the sentinel, recovering his&#xD;
weapon, and resuming his pace.&#xD;
'T he watchword is changed!' whispered&#xD;
Paulo, aghast.&#xD;
' Aye, for that department,' added the&#xD;
noble, in explanation. 'Fear not-another&#xD;
door than tile one we entered, must be near&#xD;
at hand, as the quick breathing and sudden&#xD;
entrance of yon cavalier plainly denote. Let&#xD;
us seek it.'&#xD;
They emerged slowly from their conceal-&#xD;
ment, and, watching the moment when the&#xD;
sentinel had turned, strode hastily past the&#xD;
door. Turning an angle, some few yards&#xD;
beyond, they fund themselves in a broad,&#xD;
high, arched passage, whose only light was&#xD;
received from a torch, which stood in the&#xD;
centre of the pave, supported by three port-&#xD;
able, upraised poles.&#xD;
'We are near the door,' whispered the&#xD;
noble; 'dost detect the coolness of the air?'&#xD;
I do,' responded Paulo, looking fearfully&#xD;
I arou:.d.&#xD;
&#xD;
I.&#xD;
&#xD;
20&#xD;
&#xD;
-Z&#xD;
&#xD;
' Have the dagger I gave thee at hand,'&#xD;
continued Galliano, 'for if there be a pass-&#xD;
word for the knave who stands sentry at the&#xD;
door other than the ones we have, we must&#xD;
fight for our egress.'&#xD;
As they proceeded, the passage, at every&#xD;
step grew less wide, till only one person&#xD;
tould make his way. A faint light ahead,&#xD;
encouraged them, and they trode swiftly on,&#xD;
when, all at once, they found themselves in&#xD;
a large, semi-circular vault, lighted by three&#xD;
lamps, hanging by chains from the high,&#xD;
arched ceiling, each about forty feet from&#xD;
the other. The atmosphere was cool and&#xD;
refreshing, and contrasted strongly with the&#xD;
confined air of the vault they had just left.&#xD;
A sound like the rushing of waters fell&#xD;
upon their ears, but no human object met&#xD;
their searching eyes. By the light of the&#xD;
burning lamps, they could distinctly perceive&#xD;
a semi-circular range of dungeons before&#xD;
them, each heavily barred and locked. Con-&#xD;
vinced, by the atmosphere and the noise of&#xD;
ti beating surge, that either a dooror win-&#xD;
dow-was at hand, the keen eye of the noble&#xD;
searched every spot around, till, glancing&#xD;
upward, over the range behind him, he dis-&#xD;
covered a small, grated window, through&#xD;
the broken panes of which the night winds&#xD;
rushed, and revealed to him at once the&#xD;
cause of the refreshing atmosphere around&#xD;
him. While pondering on what part of&#xD;
Venice the grated window-faced, his coin-&#xD;
panion touched him gently on the shoulder,&#xD;
and pointed silently to a figure, with his back&#xD;
towards them, sitting on a low stool, in the&#xD;
extreme corner of the vault: Imagining,&#xD;
and with reason, that this man must be the&#xD;
sentry of the main entrance, though, in con.&#xD;
sequence of the gloom around him, no door&#xD;
was visible, Galliano touched his lip with&#xD;
his finger, to his companion, and, grasping&#xD;
firmly the hilt of his drawn sword, advanced,&#xD;
on tip-toe, in the direction of the sentry,&#xD;
when he suddenly grasped him by the throat,&#xD;
and hurled him to the ground. It was the&#xD;
work of a moment, and so hastily and perfect-&#xD;
ly had the feat been executed, that the poor&#xD;
wretch fell without a mutter, or a groan.&#xD;
'A  word, a whisper, or the slightest&#xD;
movement, and this steel is in thy throat!'&#xD;
exclaimed Galliano, in a hurried whisper,&#xD;
as he stood threateningly over the prostrate&#xD;
figure, his sword pointing to his breast.&#xD;
'eize his keys!' added the noble, to his&#xD;
companion, who, dagger in hand, had now&#xD;
approached.&#xD;
Paulo stooped, and, from the girdle of the&#xD;
unresisting sentinel, wrenched a huge bunch&#xD;
of keys, and handed them, in silence to Gal-&#xD;
liano, who, grasping them firmly, bade his&#xD;
astonished victim rise. The gondolier as-&#xD;
sisted,- and, in the act, bared his dagger&#xD;
across the wretch's throat, muttering as he&#xD;
4id so-'Attempt to struggle, escape, or call&#xD;
for help, and my knife and thy gullet shall&#xD;
kly acquainted!'&#xD;
&#xD;
ZA&#xD;
&#xD;
- The poor wretch made no attempt to di-&#xD;
obey, but gazed sullenly at his captors.&#xD;
I'Now, knave,' said the young noble, i u&#xD;
peratively, 'where is the door that lrprns&#xD;
from these infernal caverns ? Speak, o1 ;&#xD;
slay thee!'&#xD;
The sentinel spoke not, but pointed to t11 e&#xD;
wall in front of which he had been sittimit;.&#xD;
The noble turned, and discovered a bro 1,&#xD;
dark door, with a huge lock and thi ce&#xD;
heavy cross bars. Seizing, instinctively, tiic&#xD;
largest key, he applied it cautiously to f-e&#xD;
key-hole, imd turned the-lock. Then slidig&#xD;
back the bars, the door easily ca ite op I,&#xD;
revealing a flight of broad, winding staint.&#xD;
'On reaching the top of yon stair cae,&#xD;
where shall I find myself?'demanded i.e&#xD;
noble, sternly.&#xD;
'In a bare apartment, lit by a single la "p,&#xD;
the door of which, fastened by a single lo, 1,&#xD;
opens into the Grand Square, directly front-&#xD;
ing St. Mark's,' replied the sentry.&#xD;
' And that door can be opened from %v th-&#xD;
out ?'&#xD;
' Aye-by a latch-key, of which e-y&#xD;
member of the Council is provided with a&#xD;
duplicate. The exterior of the apart atit&#xD;
represents an ordinary dwelling, and is&#xD;
guarded on either side by the habitation of&#xD;
a member of the Tribunal.'&#xD;
Is this the entrance for prisoners?'&#xD;
It is.'&#xD;
'The only one?'&#xD;
'No ;-there is another.'&#xD;
'And that-'&#xD;
'Is through a secret door in the wiute&#xD;

'How long art thou on guard here ?&#xD;
From dusk till dawn.'&#xD;
Thy name?'&#xD;
'Ugerto.'&#xD;
'How long hast thou been in the sei tioe&#xD;

' Three years.'&#xD;
' Stayest thou by force?'&#xD;
I do.'&#xD;
'Thy wages?'&#xD;
'Bread, wine, raiment and couch.'&#xD;
If thou desert'st ?'&#xD;
'The creatures of the "Ten" darf not&#xD;

'And if they do?'&#xD;
'If caught; the "Fire Chamber" is their&#xD;
doom-they are burned to a crisp, and .heir&#xD;

'Have any prisoners been brought th; ough&#xD;

'Aye, two.'&#xD;

F'nough ! 1 trust thee ! Release him!'&#xD;
P olo let go his hold, and the old senti-&#xD;
nel owed his banks. Emotion was plain-&#xD;
ly v  bible on his boldly delineated features -&#xD;
but ' was thi- emotion of one who had long&#xD;
sine learned to curb the rising passions of&#xD;
his ' heart. His face was livid, clammy ; his&#xD;
eyes large, dark, but lustreless ; his 'hands&#xD;
ro-' ,bony, and indicative of grcat strength;&#xD;
his torm  about the common height, his&#xD;
shot ders broad, and covered with a loose,&#xD;
coar-s, dark-hued tunic, which reached but&#xD;
&#xD;
slightly below his knees, revealing the na.&#xD;
kedness of his legs and feet, the latter being&#xD;
preserved from contact with the ground by&#xD;
a pair, of rough, black sandals. His arms&#xD;
were bare, and his chin and upper lip cover.&#xD;
ed with a profusion of dark, bushy hair,&#xD;
His aspect was hideous, gaunt and grim,&#xD;
As the light of the hanging lamp fell upon&#xD;
his face, the keen eye of Galliano detected&#xD;
a twitching on his wrinkled brow and&#xD;
cheeks, and a swimming in his lustreless&#xD;
eyes, which plainly told how deeply his&#xD;
heart was wrung with suffering.&#xD;
'Shall I open number eight?' asked the&#xD;
sentry,. his voice thicker and hoarser than&#xD;
before.&#xD;
Thou meant no treachery?'&#xD;
'By all my hopes of' heaven, no!'&#xD;
'Enough-I'll trust thee. Take the keys.&#xD;
The old man took the bunch, and, select&#xD;
ing the proper key, advanced towards the&#xD;
dungeoii. After cautiously turning the lock&#xD;
and shoving back the bars, the door swung&#xD;
open, and the old man entered the cell. A&#xD;
noise, like the falling of chains, was heard,&#xD;
and, a few moments afterwards, the old nan&#xD;
re-appeared, bearing in his sinewy arms the&#xD;
slumbering body of his son. He laid his&#xD;
burden softly upon the pave before the no-&#xD;
ble; and, kneeling by it, pointed to the body&#xD;
and exclaimed, in a lw, choked voice-&#xD;
' Behold, in the dungeons of the masters and&#xD;
rulers of Venice-behold a sight for a fath.&#xD;
er .'&#xD;
' Hast thou a father's heart and permittest&#xD;
thy son to lie there, when an effort of thine&#xD;
could restore him to life and freedom?' said&#xD;
Galliano, in a stern, reproachful tone, eye-&#xD;
ing the sentry.                       ,&#xD;
'That effort were death to him and m,,'&#xD;
responded the old man, in a low, hoarse&#xD;
voice; ' the argus-eyed Tribunal would hunt&#xD;
us in the extreme corners of the earth, and&#xD;
drag us back to unescaping death!'&#xD;
'What ! lovest thou life ?&#xD;
'Ave, count-for my boy's sake.'&#xD;
'Ifis sake ! Ha! ha ! old man, what aid&#xD;
can'st thou render him?'&#xD;
'INone, my lord, till his sentence be o'er.&#xD;
Then-'&#xD;
'Ha ! and then?'   -&#xD;
'Then,--that is iny secret, my lord !'said&#xD;
the sentry, suddenly recollecting himself,&#xD;
and raising the body.-' Follow me, and thou&#xD;
shalt see,' he added, lifting his son care-&#xD;
fully, and walking in the direction of the&#xD;
passage through which the nobfe and his&#xD;
companion had come.&#xD;
' Ha ! stay, whither goest thou?' demaid-&#xD;
ed Galliano, sternly, and advailcing towards&#xD;

The sentry answered not, but on reaching&#xD;
the entrance to the passage, paused, and&#xD;
pressing a stone, a door in the wall flew&#xD;

With our kind reader'a leave, we will now&#xD;
leap over time a week, during which inter-&#xD;
regnum some incidents pertaining to, this&#xD;
history transpired, which, in their proper&#xD;
time and place shall find a fitful- record.&#xD;
We'll chance th. scene., too, and tisher into&#xD;

kept too far in the vista-our heroine.&#xD;
Reader, hast thou ever been in the favor-&#xD;
ed land-the land of song and beauty ; thE&#xD;
land, above all others, where the Eterna&#xD;
One tarried the longest while creating hi&#xD;
fatr and beauteous Earth ; the land whert&#xD;
every zephyr is an angel's whisper-where&#xD;
every rustling of a flower leaf is a flower"&#xD;

rmoisteniwg,golden beauty that almost shame.&#xD;
the brightt and mellowing sun-where thi&#xD;
dews of dawn infuse new life, new strength&#xD;
new  blood, new nerve, into the wearies&#xD;
frame-where the pale cheek is made ros)&#xD;
and hicalthful, as the first blu'h of youth&#xD;
by the pellucid atmosphere-where, a&#xD;
night, the stars shine brightest, and th&#xD;
moon gleams purest-where the sky i&#xD;
bluer, the clouds lovelier, the atmospher&#xD;
clearer, the flowers brighter, gayer ant&#xD;
more lovely in their variegated hues, an(&#xD;
the waters more blue and clear than in an&#xD;
ether of the water-bound islets of God'&#xD;
&#xD;
fair garden, Earth ; where man is blithest.&#xD;
gayest, boldest--where woman is more the&#xD;
seraph and, at the same time the syren-&#xD;
the syren conscious of the all-conq.ering&#xD;
attributes of her nature-where old men of&#xD;
three-score are glad, joyous and fleet-lii'nb.&#xD;
ed as the youth of eighteen of less-favored&#xD;
climes-where every gale hath music in it&#xD;
-where the very waves dash on the pale,&#xD;
sands like murmuring lullabys, and are&#xD;
echoed by the busy, ever-flying zephyrs :bove&#xD;
-and where the full, loud, ripe, hearty&#xD;
laugh is heard from every honest heart the&#xD;
isle around, for very mirth and gladuess-&#xD;
Venice!  Hast thou   been  there reader&#xD;
mine, and not felt thyself nearer the Para-&#xD;
dise of eastern fable, or that truer, holier&#xD;
home spoken of in the Tome of tomes, than&#xD;
ever, or in reality or in thy dreams, beforeV&#xD;
What though dark dungeons, and bridges,&#xD;
and narrow, winding waters confront thee at-&#xD;
every turn-what though tm stic tales, and&#xD;
legends of terror and mystery, salute thine&#xD;
ear at dawn, high noon and dusk and even-&#xD;
what though grim processions and fiendish&#xD;
instruments of % power inhuman warn thee&#xD;
to be mute in thy speech and thought, and&#xD;
ever inert in action-what then ?-The&#xD;
calm, refreshing, invigorating air -the mel-&#xD;
low haze and inspiriting sheen of earth's&#xD;
day-god-the bright, b'lue sky--the deep,&#xD;
broad, gay, sun-kissed mirror of the cloudaS&#xD;
and sky-the Adriatic, are about thee still,&#xD;
telling thee of beauties so vast and glorious,&#xD;
that man, for all his powers of appreciation&#xD;
of the bright and beautiful, for all his skep-&#xD;
ticism of the works of Deity, for all his&#xD;
loathing of the dopraiity of man, must first&#xD;
bow his head in worship to the bright and&#xD;
beautiful, ere he passes censure on the&#xD;
things of ill and villainy around him.&#xD;
.   In an obscure quarter of the city, in a&#xD;
dwelling as humble in its exterior as the ob-&#xD;
scurity of the section in which it stood,&#xD;
dwelt Uberoni, the Usurer. Though strong,&#xD;
- ly suspected of possessing wealth, the hum-&#xD;
ble exterior of his abode seemed to give&#xD;
l such belief the lie.. Though -s well known&#xD;
s throughout Venice as the Doge himself,&#xD;
and equally-as loathed, yet-for all his repu.&#xD;
tation for wealth-no man's doors were&#xD;
freer from  the depredations of midnight&#xD;
thieves, nor the person of Foscari himself&#xD;
more safe from danger or insult. In fact,&#xD;
lie was strongly suspected of being one of&#xD;
the numerous instruments or- spies of the&#xD;
secret and dreaded "Tribunal," and'by not&#xD;
a few  was he secretly deemed to liold a&#xD;
more important position in the eyes Jf that&#xD;
t terrible body. Though the quarter of the&#xD;
e town in which he lived was inhabited by&#xD;
s the poorest and vilest,. and therefore the&#xD;
e section most populated, still, for years pre-&#xD;
d vious to the opening of our tale, the rude,&#xD;
d low dwellings an either side of the Usurer's&#xD;
y  house, had stood tenantless. Though their&#xD;
s rents werc comparatively, nominal, still so&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE.&#xD;
&#xD;
great and so universal was the dread of'this&#xD;
man, that the dwellings in question were&#xD;
shunned by all, as if a curse rested upon&#xD;
them. Whenever-the Usurer was seen to&#xD;
leave his door, at what hour soever of tle&#xD;
day or night, the inhabitants of the street,&#xD;
though sitting before their own doors, cea-&#xD;
sed speaktng-the laugh was broken-the&#xD;
merry jest sundered-the low whisper si-&#xD;
lenced, each eye bent fearfully to the ground,&#xD;
tll he had passed from  their sight. His&#xD;
door was ever closed and locked, and his&#xD;
small windows heavily curtained ; precau-&#xD;
nons almost entirely useless ; for scarcely a&#xD;
being, of the thousands dwelling in that part&#xD;
of the citypassing,would have had "Ie nerve,&#xD;
to turn his eye in the direction ofthe house&#xD;
though its door stood agape. A small,&#xD;
square, faded sign hung by the entrance,&#xD;
giving notice of the name and calling of the&#xD;
tenant, and also of his business hours ; still,&#xD;
as was well known to the peor'e of that&#xD;
neighborhood, the Usurer did his business&#xD;
elsewhere.&#xD;
On a bright morning,-about a week after&#xD;
the incidents recorded in the preceding&#xD;
chapter,- -a young, handsome and gaily at-&#xD;
tireI cavalier, was seen advancing in the&#xD;
direction of the Usurer's house. He wore&#xD;
scarlet trousers, fitting tightly to the skin,&#xD;
the outward seams hidden by a bright, gold.&#xD;
spangled stripe ; a jacket, of blue velvet,&#xD;
trimmed with  white eimine and snowy&#xD;
frills, and a jewelled cross ; a shoulder&#xD;
cloak, of the same glossy material ; a circu-&#xD;
lar, low-crowned cap, ol' a hue correspond-&#xD;
ing with his cloak and jacket, ornamented&#xD;
with a high, ostrich -plume, fastened in&#xD;
front by a jewelled l-oop ; white kid gaunt-&#xD;
lets, yellow boots, and a long, slender, sil-&#xD;
ver-burnished rapier. His figure was slight-&#xD;
ly above the common height, and finely&#xD;
moulded ; his step firm and proud ; his fea-&#xD;
tures of the Roman order, and haughty as&#xD;
the noblest-born of that once martial race;&#xD;
his head was covered with hair of the deep-&#xD;
est jet, and was thrown backwards in ring-&#xD;
letted ma-sesrevealing in full his broad,high-&#xD;
ly-polished brow; he wore small mustachios,&#xD;
and his jetty beard was trimmed to a poit&#xD;
His whole appearance, at once proclaimed&#xD;
his rank, and as he passed, the obsequious&#xD;
and deferential bows and doffing of caps, by&#xD;
the people, attested their knowledge of his&#xD;
name, caste and person. On arri-ving at the&#xD;
house of the Usurer, the young noble tapped&#xD;
' hastily at the door ;it was opened slowly, by&#xD;
a tall, stout black, -dressed in along, dark&#xD;
tunic, fastened together, in rough, careless&#xD;
folds, round the waist by a leathern belt,&#xD;
from which hung a long, slender dagger,en-&#xD;
eas'd in a sheath of plain brass ; a pair of&#xD;
well-worn sandals completed his attire.&#xD;
*Is thy master at home, knave?' demand-&#xD;
ed the noble, haughtily.&#xD;
The black answered by gestures, that he&#xD;
was, bu\ engaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
'But I must see him,' said the noble,&#xD;
brushing past him, haughtily, and entering&#xD;
a door on his right.&#xD;
The black gave a significant shrug, closed&#xD;
the door, and disappeared, hastily, down the&#xD;
basement stairs.&#xD;
'Ho, ho, my trusty man-of-gold,' cried&#xD;
the noble, laughing, on entering the room,&#xD;
fss lie caught a glimpse of a female dress&#xD;
hastily disappearing through the door of an&#xD;
inner room  'Ho ! ho! So thou hast not&#xD;
forget thy young years, yer-a petticoat in&#xD;
thy house ! Uo, ho! a precious sage and&#xD;
moralist thou art, my trusty-gray-beard!'&#xD;
The Usurer colored, and was sanimeling&#xD;
an excuse, when the noble, laughing, inter-&#xD;
rupted him s.ying-' Nay, no excuses, bring&#xD;
in the lady-I must see her-- ou know how&#xD;
fond I am of the fair-what pains I take to&#xD;
make myself agreeable, and how agreeable&#xD;
I can make myself, when I try ! So, oblige&#xD;
me with an introduction.'&#xD;
' Pardon me, my lord,' said the Usurer,&#xD;
slowly, 'but I cannot oblige you, at least to-&#xD;
day.'&#xD;
SWhy not, my youthful money-lender?'&#xD;
inquired the other, laughing, 'you must have&#xD;
the poor thing imprisoned in this little box,&#xD;
like a captive bird, and allow no ey es othet&#xD;
than your own, and that dumb porter's and&#xD;
knave-of-al-work of thine, to gaze upon her&#xD;
beauty, or listen to her songs I And that,&#xD;

' Have they refused to ?' asked the young&#xD;
girl, weeping.&#xD;
'They have not,' replied the usurer;'they&#xD;

them. Shall I tell thee a secret?  And if&#xD;
so, wilt thou retain it '&#xD;
'I-?' She laughed, but a sob was min-&#xD;

'Thou'rt fight,' said the usurer, catching&#xD;
'Q,    the meaning.of her laugh; :if thou hast no&#xD;
means of conversing, to whom  canst thou&#xD;

'When they return-as return they must,&#xD;

The suspected, inVenice, are condemned&#xD;
before they are arrested.- The arrest is but&#xD;
the forerunner of the shroud.'&#xD;
'But they've escaped.'&#xD;
'Aye-and I will tell thee how. Dost&#xD;
remember the night of the old man's arrest ?'&#xD;
'Ido.'&#xD;
That night Odo, the Tribunal's Death&#xD;
Messenger, presented the old lord a packet:&#xD;
it summoned him to leave undone whatever&#xD;
he was doing-if eating his food, tolay down&#xD;
the untasted mouthful-if drinking, to set&#xD;
down the cip, without tasting, though it&#xD;
were within a hair of his lip-if preparing&#xD;
for his bed, to don his cloak and cap, and,&#xD;
without a word, without a glance, without&#xD;
'-    a movement, without a sign eould be trans-&#xD;
lated by a child, to follow the Tribunal's&#xD;
messenger. He did so: for his rank's sake,&#xD;
the Ten awaited his coming.- Sooner even&#xD;
than they thought, sooner than they looked&#xD;
for, their victim was before them. Sooner&#xD;
than he wished, the old rman stood in the&#xD;
council chamber, in the presence of those&#xD;
whose fiat was as relentless as their decrees&#xD;
were terrible. A chamber, eighteen feet&#xD;
high, fifty broad, and fifty deep, the walls&#xD;
and ceiling hung with black, with devices&#xD;
of every torture used, curiously wrought&#xD;
thereon, each device being in itself a picture&#xD;
to fright the prisoner ere he has spoke a&#xD;
word, ere a word has been spoken to hin,-&#xD;
with ten masked men, in black, sitting in a&#xD;
semi-circle, on a raised platform, before him.&#xD;
Pale but firm, the lord stood before his&#xD;
S  doomosmen. The charge of endeavoring to&#xD;
&#xD;
RL OF VENICE.                        27&#xD;
suborne the peace and welfare of the state&#xD;
was put against him. The old roan fleplied&#xD;
by demanding the name of his accuser.&#xD;
' Leonardo Foscari,' was the answer. The&#xD;
accuser and the accused stood face to face-&#xD;
a triumph in the young man's eyes,-aston-&#xD;
ishment, withering scorn atd defiance, in the&#xD;
face of the old. Deep silence reigned awhile,&#xD;
A signal was given-a box was handed&#xD;
round-the box was opened-and lo ! 'twas&#xD;
empty-the lord's doom was spoken, sealed,&#xD;
without a word-the interior of the box was&#xD;
black-nothing iwhitened it-lie was doom-&#xD;
ed! Three nights afterward, lie suffered&#xD;
In the -sulphur dungeon. Hast thou ever&#xD;
heard how terrible is that death? I'll tell&#xD;
.thee.-The victim's dungeon is strongly&#xD;
barred, so that his strength., be it as super-&#xD;
human as it may, cannot burst the dooi-; the&#xD;
walls and ceiling are covered with soft,&#xD;
springy wool, so that, when frantic, the vic-&#xD;
tim cannot dash his brains out ; by degrees,&#xD;
the sulphur, mixed with white powder,&#xD;
ground from lilies' hearts, begin. to ooze&#xD;
through holes in the floor: the sensation is&#xD;
delightful beyond conception-to the aged&#xD;
victim, youth seems to be restored; 'the&#xD;
bright visions and dreams of boyhood, glide&#xD;
past the mind's eye-the air built castles,&#xD;
the amours and gaieties and enjoyments of&#xD;
body and mind pass, as in a mirror, before.&#xD;
his mental vision-in a momen , as if by&#xD;
magic, this vanishes, and the vict m is seiz-&#xD;
ed with cramps and chills,--his very blood&#xD;
seems dried up-his veins and nerves Inock&#xD;
one against the other, creating pains and&#xD;
agony beyond belief. The flood of vapor&#xD;
changes, as to a mist-through which the&#xD;
victim's countless actions and scenes; from&#xD;
youth to the silver hairs upon his head, the&#xD;
gay and the grave, -he innocent and the&#xD;
guilty hours of pas'ime- it seems as if all&#xD;
the chambers of mentory are opened wide,&#xD;
that the spectres of the brain are dancing&#xD;
before your eye, as in a magician's mirror.&#xD;
The vapor fades slowly-and again the chills&#xD;
and pains of torture seize upon the victim,&#xD;
only more intensely than before. A sharp&#xD;
pang fastens upon his forehead-vultures&#xD;
appear to be devouring his body-lie strives&#xD;
to, speak, to cry, to groan, but cannot-the&#xD;
pain is so intense that he cannot utter a sin-&#xD;
gle word. Again the vapor rises-tie vic-&#xD;
tim feels relief according as the nist in-&#xD;
creases in thickness around him. 'he t.ell&#xD;
becomes more crowded with th6 vapor every&#xD;
moment, and in proportion does the delight&#xD;
-of the victim increase. The spiritual world&#xD;
is opened to his mental vision, all nis doncep-&#xD;
tions of the happv land ef the Hereafter are&#xD;
embodied and aiured before him. A spirit&#xD;
stands on the s'lore, and beckons him to&#xD;
come. The vapor again vanishes, and the&#xD;
former tortures seize him with increasing&#xD;
virulence. He yells, screams, starts, springs&#xD;
from corner to corner of his cell, as if pur-&#xD;
sued by a demon. Again the vapor rushes&#xD;

rif. Draw, and defend thyself.'&#xD;
The spel Iwas brolken-t~cugh returneJ,&#xD;
and the usurer, casting a glance behind&#xD;
him, sznatclred tip the torch, and darted down&#xD;
the stairs leading to the vault. . With a&#xD;
Spring blithe as mis own, the noble darted&#xD;
after him, closely followed by the affrighted&#xD;
orange girl. As she flew past the distended&#xD;
black, a'hasty hand attempted to grasp the&#xD;
skirts of her dress, but fear winged her&#xD;
footsteps, and she escaped the death-clutch&#xD;
of the wounded mute.&#xD;
The vault into which the usurer fled was&#xD;
deep ari3 spacious, and contained a range of&#xD;
nine low arches, which were covered by&#xD;
heavy oaken doors-the depositories, doubt-&#xD;
less,'of the old nan's valuables and papers&#xD;
&#xD;
rhe walls were thick and mouldy, and a&#xD;
hilly atmosphere pervaded its length and&#xD;
readtb. A small blind grating stood on&#xD;
ne side of the vault, near the ceiling, while'&#xD;
irectly beneath it, rose an earthy mound,&#xD;
haped like a lowly grave.&#xD;
As the orange girl reached the foot of&#xD;
he rough, broad stairs of the vaulc, she&#xD;
tarted on beholding Gallianu graspng the&#xD;
listet'ded usurer by the throat, with one&#xD;
rand, and with the other pointing to the&#xD;
'rave.&#xD;
The features of the usurer were pale as&#xD;
shes, his eyes seemed starting from their&#xD;
ockets, and his whole frame shivered like&#xD;
rne in the last throes il' life. In his pow.&#xD;
less hand ie grasped*a broken blade,&#xD;
which plainly told the history of his last&#xD;
hort, but hasty combat.&#xD;
' Look i,here, caitiff!' exclaimed the ex-&#xD;
ited noble, pointing to the grave, '1ok&#xD;
here, where repose the bones of my father!&#xD;
See where his spirit stands in sorrow-his&#xD;
ustreless eyes gazing on thee, his murder-&#xD;

Then dragging the body to the grave, k-z&#xD;
exclgimed-' Father! let mhy troubled spirit&#xD;
rest: for here, on the altar of thy grave, I&#xD;

Tihe sword of the frenzied noble passed&#xD;
thrice through the breast of the usurer, and&#xD;
the dreaded President of the Tribunm was&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;
TI B ROBB'2RY AND' DISci         RY&#xD;
The night following the incidents of the&#xD;
preceding chapter, two fashionably dressed&#xD;
young men were conve-sing in a retired&#xD;
room of an hostel well known in Venice, at&#xD;
the time of our tale, as the 'ha of thre&#xD;
Golden Grape.' It stood on the broad quay&#xD;
Orfano, and was the favorite resort, of the&#xD;
young nobles and high. ranks, as its wines,&#xD;
edibles, smoking-reeds, and accommodations&#xD;
were said to be superior to those of any other&#xD;
hostel in Italy.&#xD;
A rmind table was before then, on which&#xD;
two large waxen tapers burned, throwing a&#xD;
bright light on the spangled and jewelled~&#xD;
gear of the gallants, as they quaffed their&#xD;
goblets of generous grape, during their whis-&#xD;
pered speech.&#xD;
" I tell thee, Leon, no harn can possibly&#xD;
come of it, if we proceed with despatch&#xD;
&#xD;
"R   and secresy,' said the taller of-the two, in a&#xD;
low, cautious voice, and draining his cup of&#xD;
its mellowy juice.&#xD;
'But we need more help,' responded his&#xD;
companion, half falteringly: 'if we should&#xD;
- be surprised-?&#xD;
'V e need not be surprised,' persisted the&#xD;
former, earnestly; 'if we but take the pro-&#xD;
4    t.er hour, and use sufficient precaution, nei-&#xD;
ther noise norscuffle shall ensue. What need,&#xD;
then, of other' confederates, to whom we&#xD;
must allow an eqpal share of the spoil?&#xD;
Besides, how know we that they would&#xD;
keep their own counsel, after the deed&#xD;
They might betray us, and then, shame and&#xD;
ruin would be our  portion. No-no ! we&#xD;
must have no m r sharers in that rich&#xD;
booty. There will be none too much-even&#xD;
A    though there should be a thousand times&#xD;
more than I suspect-in his strong box.&#xD;
Besides, think of the girl-or, despite what&#xD;
I 1 have said, [ do not believe~she is yet wed-&#xD;
ded to the old moan-is there not jov, rap-&#xD;
ture, more than bliss in that thought ?&#xD;
Speak, shall we hazard it?'&#xD;
I care not if we do,' replied the other,&#xD;
slowly, ' provided thou art certain there is&#xD;
no danger in the attempt: and that, after&#xD;
the usurer is dead, thou wilt share fairly in&#xD;
the monies and jewels.'&#xD;
'I pledge 'myself to as much. Is it a&#xD;
bargain 2'&#xD;
' It is,'Oplied his companion, giving him&#xD;
his hand.&#xD;
At this moment, the door of the chamber&#xD;
opened, and a young fashionable presented&#xD;
himself to the "yes of the plotters.&#xD;
'Ha ! Lorenzo, my .g'ay madcap,' ex-&#xD;
claimed 'lie first speaker, his sober counte-&#xD;
nance changing, all at once, to the Joyster-&#xD;
er's careless smile, 'give thee good even!&#xD;
What circumstance indebts us for thy most&#xD;
welcome company?'&#xD;
'Have ye heard the news?' sad the new&#xD;
comer, seating himself, and clearing his&#xD;
throat with a draught of the tempting&#xD;
juice before him.&#xD;
'I good, sooth! not I,' replied the roue,&#xD;
'I, for one, am no newsmonger. But to&#xD;
what do you allude?'&#xD;
- The usurer,-the life of the money-&#xD;
mart-has not been seen "on change" to-day.'&#xD;
'Indeed ! The reason '&#xD;
'I have not, heard. Some suppose him&#xD;
ill-others, that ie is engaged in forming a&#xD;
-lcontract with the devil how to get -all the&#xD;
A   currency of V.;nice in his grasp.  I con-&#xD;
fess that I incline to the latter opinion my-&#xD;
'Ha! ha!' laughed the roue, glancing&#xD;
V     rareaningly at Leon, ' doubtless, it is so: for&#xD;
the white-haired kna,'e hath either had his&#xD;
soul so deeply wrapt in the study and wor-&#xD;
- ship of Mamnon, that it is no wonder if he&#xD;
hath now, i  his old age, sacrificed a day in&#xD;
out how to change his copper into&#xD;
gold. N Vhy, my merry hearts,' he continu-&#xD;
&#xD;
ed, re-filli-g his cup, and emptying it at a&#xD;
swallow, as if to quiet the restlessness whicn&#xD;
had seized upon his nerves by the intelli-&#xD;
gence brought by Lorenzo, 'do ye not re-&#xD;
collect how, .some ten or twelve year&#xD;
agone, the old wretch was absent from the&#xD;
mart two whole days ; and 'that,, when he&#xD;
returned, how desperately he plunged iat"&#xD;
the stocks, outbidding all, till it seemed as&#xD;
if lie meant to buy up all Venice?  Do ye&#xD;
not remember it ?'&#xD;
'I was young then,' said Lorenzo; 'but&#xD;
I remember the sensation it made irhrougi-&#xD;
out the city.'&#xD;
'I have a recollection of it, too,' added&#xD;
Leon ; 'it was about the time of thie myste-&#xD;
rious disappearance of the elder Galliarno.'&#xD;
'Exactly,' said' t'e roue, his cheek chang.&#xD;
int color, 'it was the very time. And, my&#xD;
life on't ! this is but another of his tricks:&#xD;
and, it will be well for our impoverished&#xD;
merchants, if his re-appearance to-niorrow,&#xD;
or next day, be not followed by the same&#xD;
disastrous result.'&#xD;
As he spoke, his eyes met Lorenzo's ; a&#xD;
sickly smile hovered round the lips of the&#xD;
latter.&#xD;
 But come, my merry hearts,' cried the&#xD;
rouc, 'let us forth. The night is tempting,&#xD;
and woos, us forth. I would nbt stay in-&#xD;
doors on such a night for the brightest smile&#xD;
of my mistress. Come!&#xD;
' Nay, I prefer the grape and weed,' said&#xD;
Lorenzo, filling his cup to the brim. 'Soon&#xD;
as this goblet is emptied, and this sweet-&#xD;
flavored Turkish powder wasted in clouds,&#xD;
I shall hie me home: for I have a chiding&#xD;
letter to write to my fair mistress, ere 1&#xD;
seek slumber ;and I m st drink wine enough&#xD;
to nerve me for tie task.'&#xD;
,  Chide 'her not too harshly,' said the&#xD;
roue, laughing, and leaving the room, fol-&#xD;
lowed by Leon.&#xD;
They passed through tie hostel, laugh-&#xD;
ing, and nodding carelessly to those whom&#xD;
they met,&#xD;
"hey walked on, in silence, each busy&#xD;
with his thoughts, till they reached an un-&#xD;
frequented part of the quay.&#xD;
' Hold'st thca still thy mind?' said Lo-&#xD;
renco, breaking the silence.&#xD;
'Listen, and then judge,' -eplied tire&#xD;
other, with g-eat coolness. ' For the past&#xD;
eight months I have run ot, in extravagance,&#xD;
upwards of four thousand ducats ; a thou-&#xD;

must be paid. Most of the money falls due&#xD;

vault where Fate seemed to levd her shafts on the succeeding morn, the few domestics&#xD;
&#xD;
of the house of Galliano were assembled in&#xD;
the old reception hall, to witness the last&#xD;
sad rites of 'holy church' over the ashes of&#xD;
the dead. The bier stood in the centre of&#xD;
the chamber, upon two mounted stools ;&#xD;
around wh'ch, on little circular tables, wax-&#xD;
en tapers gleamed. A priest sat by the cof-&#xD;
fin, reading his breviary in silence, while&#xD;
the parties who were privileged to attend&#xD;
tLe service were gathering.&#xD;
Two young females in deep mourning,&#xD;
sat together on a cushioned and muffled&#xD;
bench near the reverend man, while the few&#xD;
friends of the young lord of Galliano sat on&#xD;
muffled chairs in promiscuous groups around&#xD;
the bier. The ycang lord himself soon en-&#xD;
tered, attired in a suit of mourning, and took&#xD;
a seat at the foot of the bier. He shed no&#xD;
tears, but his features bore those unmistake-&#xD;
able traces of true grief, which command'&#xD;
more attention than even tears ; and, as his&#xD;
large dark eyes fell sadly on the pall, every&#xD;
eye was moistened, every heart touched in&#xD;
sympathy. There was a nobleness in his&#xD;
tearless eye,a majesty in his colorless cheek,&#xD;
yea, a solemnity on his pale, nervous brow,&#xD;
which struck the assembled auditors with&#xD;
pity, and produced in each a willing readi-&#xD;
ness to die in his defence, if such sacrifice&#xD;
was necessary. There was scarce a being&#xD;
in that chamber who had not, within the&#xD;
past few months, felt the blessings either&#xD;
of his courage or his purse ; and there was&#xD;
not one but knew his love of right, his ar-&#xD;
dor as a patriot and a man, his n-lbleness of&#xD;
so:1 under every situation, and ;iis willing-&#xD;
ness to battle even for the most friendless&#xD;
in the hour of danger. Yet in his grief-in&#xD;
that hour when be mourned over the new&#xD;
found relics of his murdered father-who&#xD;
could give him consolation ?&#xD;
His mother had long since taken her place&#xD;
amid the ashes of the kindred of her lord-&#xD;
he was motherless.&#xD;
His father's bones now rested in their&#xD;
cerements--he was fatherless.&#xD;
His only brotLer had sunk to the tomb in&#xD;
earl- youth, when the worm of that fell de-&#xD;
strover of the fair and beautiful-consump-&#xD;
tion-had eaten up his heart-lie was bro-&#xD;
therless.&#xD;
His fair and angelic sister, had pined&#xD;
and sickened, and died on the loss of her&#xD;
father-the young lord of Galliano was, in&#xD;
view of all the world, kinless.&#xD;
Unknown to the Tribunal, he had return-&#xD;
id. tc Venice, and now, in his ancestral&#xD;
halls, was sole heir to his ancestral name,&#xD;
and mourner over his father's dust!&#xD;
The solemn rites of'holy church' were now&#xD;
p erformed-and the remain of the noblest&#xD;
enetian nobles were borne, with measured&#xD;
step and solemn, into the family vault, and&#xD;
raced among the ashes of its kindred.&#xD;
The rites were o'er ; the guests returned&#xD;
to their homes, and the only pillar of tht&#xD;
Galliano houz tre'ired to his e hamhebr t&#xD;
&#xD;
glean that repose which the exciting inci-&#xD;
dents of the past three days had rendered&#xD;
doubly imperative.&#xD;
CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
THE HOUSE OF CONCEALMENT&#xD;
An humble dwelling, in a retired quarter&#xD;
of Venice, was Mastachio Benedetti's; and&#xD;
a merry heart was Benedetti's; and a merry&#xD;
dame was Madame Benedetti ; and a merry&#xD;
maid was Junetta, the daughter of these&#xD;
Benedetti's.&#xD;
Benedetti was a respectable citizen;&#xD;
Madame Benedetti was a respectable wo-&#xD;
man, and a respectable citizen's wife ; and&#xD;
Junetta Benedetti, being the daughter of&#xD;
two such merry and respectable people, was,&#xD;
of course, a very merry and a very re-&#xD;
spectable girl herself. But it is a danger-&#xD;
ous thing for the young of the sterner sex,&#xD;
when a young lady of respectable parentage&#xD;
has found such qualifications to recommend&#xD;
her as respectability, wealth, merry-heart-&#xD;
edness and beauty, because such things are&#xD;
apt to engross their attention, rob them of&#xD;
their sternness, and render them love-sick :&#xD;
i. e. tender. When a youth is once touched&#xD;
with the disease commonly nicknarped&#xD;
Love, he degenerates in dignity and manli-&#xD;
ness, until he becomes the veriest bondman&#xD;
imagination can picture. With his love a&#xD;
change comes over his mental and physical&#xD;
parts, which has every thing but dignity in&#xD;
it; and it is not until he is either noosei or&#xD;
loosed, tht he recovers his former manly&#xD;
nature. The fact is, while the Love fever is&#xD;
on him, a man is a sort of pliant sapling;&#xD;
and the object of his affections a sort of&#xD;
ladle, whose coquetry draws from him the&#xD;
greater part of the natural sap in his crani-&#xD;
urn. When he is knotted, he begins to get&#xD;
an insight of the real state of things around&#xD;
him. Romance is very deceptive ; and un-&#xD;
til matrimony sweeps it aside, man is a&#xD;
laughable and ridiculous animal. The gen-&#xD;
tle sex understand this fact intuitively, and,&#xD;
through life, man is their victim-their&#xD;
play thing: in view of which facts, we&#xD;
wonder where man's charter is for pre-&#xD;
dominancy.&#xD;
These thoughts ran through the mind of&#xD;
Junetta, as she beheld, from day to day, how&#xD;
perfectly her beloved mother led her be-&#xD;
loved husband round tile matrimomai cir-&#xD;
cle ; and, as she fancied her mother's system&#xD;
of domestic government, she had made up&#xD;
t her mind to run a cord through the nostrils&#xD;
of her beloved, whoever he might be. and&#xD;
3 lead him into obedience in the same mas-&#xD;
terly manner. But, somehow, or another,&#xD;
i the youth whom, out of all her admirers,&#xD;
e she esteemed the most, lAed very like one&#xD;
who wi'1 stand bu little of this kind o:&#xD;
&#xD;

government.   His features and  general&#xD;
bearing bore the impress of one born to com-&#xD;
mand, not those of one born to be led. At&#xD;
least, so Junetta thought, and she sighed&#xD;
as she pondered over it. Now, when a&#xD;
young maiden sighs over the result of&#xD;
thought, it is a pretty good evidence that&#xD;
she is diseased around the heart ; and that&#xD;
that disease is the result of too much&#xD;
thought upon the object that created it.&#xD;
A young man, whose features proclaimed&#xD;
his recent entrance into manhood, knocked&#xD;
gently at the door of the Benedettis.&#xD;
It was opened, by a servant,and the youth,&#xD;
as if accustomed to the house, nodded famil-&#xD;
iarly to the servitor, and entered the sitting&#xD;
room without ceremony. Whena youth is-as&#xD;
far advanced as this, he is in a dangerous&#xD;
state indeed ; for he even forgets politeness.&#xD;
'I am  sure you-might have knocked,&#xD;
Messer Calvari,' said Junetta, starting up in&#xD;
coquettish confusion, as though she had not&#xD;
seen him, through the curtained window,&#xD;
ere he knocked at the door.&#xD;
' Indeed, my pretty lady,' replied Messer&#xD;
Calvari, c'so I might, if my head had not&#xD;
been so filled with thoughts of a certain&#xD;
young lady.'&#xD;
' To whom does Messer Calvari allude?'&#xD;
inquired Junetta earnestly, as though not&#xD;
aware, in the slightest of who that certain&#xD;
young lady could be.&#xD;
He took her hand in his-he turned his&#xD;
eyes on her's-lie twined his arms around&#xD;
her waist-he drew her close to his breast-&#xD;
he put his lips to her's-and he gave her to&#xD;
understand that way, to whom he alluded.&#xD;
Junetta appeared to be satisfied with the&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
This introductory business finished. Mes-&#xD;
ser Calvari inquired if one Eugenia and a&#xD;
certain lady Isabel were visible.6&#xD;
Junetta pouted, as if jealous at the inter-&#xD;
rogatory.&#xD;
'Nay, my beloved, I bear a message, to&#xD;
them, from a gentleman in whose fate they&#xD;
are interested ; and I have promised to use&#xD;
despatch,' said the youth, earnestly. -&#xD;
' But do tell me what all this mystery&#xD;
means, Calvari,' said Junetta, inquisitively,&#xD;
' I can't bear to live in suspense. Do tell&#xD;
me who and what these strange ladies are,&#xD;
and who that strange man is that brought&#xD;
them here.'          a&#xD;
' Thou would'st not have thy Calvari for.&#xD;
feit his honor by a breach of faith, would'st.&#xD;
thou, Junetta?' inquired the youth, earnestly.&#xD;
'What, there is a mystery about them&#xD;
then ? I knew there was: from the strange&#xD;
manner in which they were brought here&#xD;
by that Messer Galliano. In the night lie&#xD;
brought them-in the dead of the night-&#xD;
and I knew nothing of their presence till I&#xD;
met them at breakfast. Father, nor moth-&#xD;
er, would tell me any thing abox. them ;&#xD;
and, moreover, enjoined me not to speak&#xD;
a word about them in the presence of&#xD;

strangers, :n any account. I declare it's a&#xD;
shame! so it is, that any modest and well&#xD;
behaved girl can't be admitted into a share&#xD;
of secret matters, as well as any one else&#xD;
And the coquettish beauty appeared to be&#xD;
very indignant at her cruel treatment.&#xD;
'And of course Junetta has not perils '&#xD;
the safety of the unhappy ladies under her&#xD;
father's roof by disobeying her parents ?' in-&#xD;
quired the youth, earnestly and tenderly ta,&#xD;
king her hand.&#xD;
Junetta gazed fondly upon-him, as she re-&#xD;
sponded, smiling, 'funetta loves her parents&#xD;
too much to permit any rash and idle curi-&#xD;
osity of her's to bring them misery, or mar&#xD;
the happiness or safety of others. But,' she&#xD;
continued in love's tone o1 tender reproach,&#xD;

I cannot help it.' 0, Calvari, if thou&#xD;

The duke led the way, through a private&#xD;
door, and into the palace.&#xD;
It was a pleasant room for converse that&#xD;
they entered. It was the private chamber&#xD;
of the Duke, and situated in the rear of the&#xD;
marble pile, and looked out upon the broad&#xD;
sheet of the moonlit Adriatic. The case-&#xD;
ments-of which there were five-were fur-&#xD;
nished in the most gorgeous style of the&#xD;
middle ages. Thd walls were hid by heavy&#xD;
arras of blue and crimson velvet ; and on one&#xD;
side, the ducal bed stood prominent, orna-&#xD;
mented-with gold and azure; beside it, the&#xD;
easy chair in which the reverend noble sat&#xD;
and meditated when released from the cares&#xD;
and troubles of his office. A few feet from&#xD;
it was a small marble altar, whose top was&#xD;
garnished by a silver crucifix ; in -ont of&#xD;
this, a low cushion, on which the zad man&#xD;
knelt at morning, noon and night, while of-&#xD;
feringup his prayers. A silver burner, rested&#xD;
on a toilet table of polished oak, between&#xD;
two windows. The floor was covered with&#xD;
a soft matting, ingeniously figured to repre.&#xD;

' Be seated,' said the duke, on entering,&#xD;
and pointing to a high cushion near his fa-&#xD;

'Now,.to thy business,' said the duke,&#xD;
seating himself. 'To what doth it relate ?&#xD;
' Thy son,' replied the stranger, laconical-&#xD;
'Indeed !-a new subject! Say on.'&#xD;
'He hath wronged a confiding heart- -&#xD;
broken it-sundered it from all its ties ant&#xD;

'I hold the wits given me by my God,&#xD;

me still as sane as e'er a breather this side&#xD;

'What! the son of a Venetian doge wed&#xD;
a wanton?'&#xD;
'No wanton, duke ; but one, by his un-&#xD;
manly acts, torn ruthlessly from honor, and&#xD;
plunged into never ceasing misery. The&#xD;
pangs are her's-the guilt, Leonardo Fos-&#xD;

'But think of the shame he'd bring upon&#xD;

'I think of nothing but his guilt, duke. I&#xD;
am a Venetian born; and, from childhood&#xD;
up to the present hour, have reverenced&#xD;
Jacopo Foscari, the famed Doge of Venice,&#xD;
as the first and purest ruler of any state on&#xD;
earth ; have prayed for him, at early morn&#xD;
and dusky eve, as one beloved and renown-&#xD;

vels, allow a taint upon his name to pass&#xD;
unvindicated or unpunished. I fought for&#xD;
him when a boy, and in his wars with the&#xD;
Turks have borne his royal banner through&#xD;
seas of blood and carnage ; have ever loved&#xD;
him as a father; reverence him still, and&#xD;
would not let his glorious fame pass on to&#xD;
posterity blemished by his son. I would&#xD;
have him vindicate his fame and name when&#xD;
assailed by his dearest kin, as well as when&#xD;
attacked by those foreign to his eye and&#xD;
heart.  I would have him  ever just-to&#xD;
the lowly as to the noble-to the weak as&#xD;
to the strong-I would have him ever Fos-&#xD;

'But thou dost forget the ignominy such&#xD;
marriage would bring upon our nobility-&#xD;
the dangers to which our throne would be&#xD;
exposed from the indignant nobles of&#xD;
Venice by such impolitic union !'  '&#xD;
'Let the marriage be never so secret, my&#xD;

she would not subject herself to the ridicule&#xD;

a pause.&#xD;
'Thou art his father,' was the meani:a&#xD;
response.&#xD;
'Thou   dost not know him,' said the&#xD;
doge, with a sigh.&#xD;
'He does not!' exclaimed a voice behind&#xD;
the arras.&#xD;
The doge started, and colored to the tem.&#xD;

stood before them.&#xD;
' Thou hast overheard us, then?' sid the&#xD;
duke, angrily; 'thou hast been playing the&#xD;
eavesdropper. Shame on thee, son!'&#xD;
'Nay, shame on thee, father,' responded  :&#xD;
Leonardo, cooly, 'who could'st give audi. '&#xD;

ly, 'then a time will come when we shall&#xD;

' Cease these idle threats,' cried the duke,&#xD;
indignantly. 'Go, my son-that I should&#xD;

Leonardo obeyed, with scowling brow,&#xD;
and wrathful step.&#xD;
'Said I not thou didst not know my son?'&#xD;
said the duke, in a somewhat piqued tone.&#xD;
' Thou said'st truly,' rejoined the mask;&#xD;

testily; 'and were it not for pity of his&#xD;

,ces, and downcast eyes, as ifan universal&#xD;
edict had been issued, forbidding speech and&#xD;
action. Men met each other in tle streets&#xD;
and squares, and, though their acquaintance-&#xD;
ship and friendliness were unbroken, yet&#xD;
passed without a word or sign of recognition.&#xD;
A dark cloud seemed to hover over the fair&#xD;
city, although the sun shone glowingly, and&#xD;
the sky was lovely as ever. Doors were&#xD;
closed, windows heavily and closely cur.&#xD;
tained, as if the stricken ones within feared&#xD;
the eyes of the fear-stricken ones without.&#xD;
One form alone was seen traversing the&#xD;
streets boldly. One form alone, amid the&#xD;
Fear-contagion dared to stalk ihrougL street&#xD;
and square, and look at the right and left,&#xD;
his large dark eye searching every face he&#xD;
met without a moment's quailing. Pale&#xD;
was his cheek, though; pale his li4 as he&#xD;
read the Fear in the closed doors and cur.&#xD;
tained windows and hasty steps and down-&#xD;
cast'eyes, and caught the laconic and fear-&#xD;
-choked words of those whose stomachs forc-&#xD;
ed them into traffic. Pale was he! but not&#xD;
with that paleness which marks the wretch&#xD;
whose timidity is caused by fear: but pale&#xD;
with that hue which the strong heart wears&#xD;
when indignation at man's cowardice takes&#xD;
the place of pity.&#xD;
With hasty strides, his good sword hang-&#xD;
ing boldly at his side, he passed from street&#xD;
to street, from square to square, from quay&#xD;
to qnay, from canal to canal, his eyes every&#xD;
tuoment searching each spot, before, behind&#xD;
and around him, as if in anxious pursuit of&#xD;
some loathed foe, or beloved friend.&#xD;
So passed the day.&#xD;
Night came ; night, with all her beauties&#xD;
and magical influences; night, with her&#xD;
.right stars, sky drapery and moon, and soft,&#xD;
wooing air; night came, and. one by one, as&#xD;
if ashamed of their-cowardice, the inhabit-&#xD;
ants of Venize braved tne outside of their&#xD;
doors. Still, the silvery .hugn rang not in&#xD;
the air, and voices were not heard alotd, as&#xD;
in knights gone by. It appeared as if hahit,&#xD;
not the loveliness of thenight, brought them&#xD;
forth ; and, more like funeral followers they&#xD;
seemed, th.n beings forth for pleasure, so&#xD;
whisperingly they spoke.&#xD;
On this night, three men, guised as com-&#xD;
mon gondoliers, met, asif by accident, a&#xD;

prove of no avail. But to the main matter&#xD;
of this conference-how didst thou find thy&#xD;
sister ?'&#xD;
'Ill in health-lowly in spirits,' replied&#xD;
the second oarsman, whom the reader has&#xD;
ere this rceognised.&#xD;
'And the lady Isabel-thbu saw'st her,&#xD;
also?'&#xD;
'Sad in spirit; e'en as sad as my sister.'&#xD;
'Liked they -their new abdde?'&#xD;
'Tis safer than their last.'&#xD;
'Sent they no message ?'&#xD;
'Much the lady Isabel blushed when your&#xD;
name was mentioned ; and much she tremb-&#xD;
ed w hen I spoke of the sudden -and myste-&#xD;
rious disappearance of the doge.'&#xD;
'But no message?'&#xD;
'None.'&#xD;
Galliano sighed, and for a few moments,&#xD;
gazed in silence toward the island where his&#xD;
beloved was concealed.&#xD;
All hope is o'er for thee, Isabel,' he mur-&#xD;
mured, 'if his our glorious cause succeed&#xD;
not ; thy Galiano will not outli ;e his rtrug-&#xD;

night watchings, our expenditure of time,&#xD;
and wealth, and blood,-our wrongs, our&#xD;
sufferins, and high hopes-shall we fail?&#xD;
Great God foi bid it!'&#xD;
In good truth, the noble was sad at neart,&#xD;
yea, o'er'hadowed to the very soul. The&#xD;
circumstances attendant on his father's deati-&#xD;
-the singular discovery of his father's grave&#xD;
-his burial in the old family vault-the&#xD;

haps death, and all through his means,-the&#xD;
g,oomt he witnessed o'er the city-all this&#xD;
&#xD;
floated through the chambers of his mind in&#xD;
images darker than the facts ;-was it then&#xD;
a wonder he was sad?&#xD;
He thought of his own cheerless home-&#xD;
of the dark prospect before his beloved in&#xD;
case all his schemes for emancipation from&#xD;
the Tribunal's tyranny should fail-of the&#xD;
wo and ruin of all engaged in that great en-&#xD;
terprise, if fortune, timeoand circumstance&#xD;
favored not the cause-of the revolution in&#xD;
men and things, if the enterprise succeeded&#xD;
-of the blood that must flow, whether tri-&#xD;
umph or defeat was their guerdon for the&#xD;
peril-he thought of this, and he was sad,--&#xD;
very, very sad.'&#xD;
' Have ye any new proselytesV said the&#xD;
noble, in a deep voice.-&#xD;
' Seventy in our section, since our last&#xD;
meeting,' replied Gennaro.&#xD;
' And thirty-three in ours,' added the&#xD;
other.&#xD;
' Good !'&#xD;
'When saw you last the secretary?' ask-&#xD;
ed Gennaro.&#xD;
' An hour before dawn of to-day,' replied&#xD;
the noble.&#xD;
'What addition to his leger since last&#xD;
report?'&#xD;
'Ninety.'&#xD;
'The work speeds on.' -&#xD;
'Aye, bravely,' said Galliano, in a more s&#xD;
cheerful voice. 'But as for - the doge, he&#xD;
must not die. le is a friend to the people-&#xD;
opposed to the Tribunal-and loves freedom&#xD;
equal to the best of us ;-he must not die.'&#xD;
' How can we save him?-' said the gondo&#xD;
liers, anxiously.&#xD;
' By hurrying on the hour when we strike&#xD;
for liberty,' responded the noble.&#xD;
' He is of too high rank for the Tribunal&#xD;
to hurry on his death,' said Gennaro. 'We&#xD;
had better look to the cause first ;-the hour&#xD;
already rapidly approaches-to hasten it&#xD;
were dangerous.'&#xD;
' Thou dost not know the "9Ten" for all&#xD;
that thou hast suffered,' said the noble ;&#xD;
c'tis the Tribunal's policy, once-their victims&#xD;
are in their power, to hurry on their doom.&#xD;
It lacks but a week of the Carnival, and, ere&#xD;
that time, thechances are an hundred to one&#xD;
that the mock trial, sentence and death of the&#xD;
doge will be over. In which case, what new&#xD;
tyranny will be planted on the ducal throne!&#xD;
It wei-e best to strike at once, and, saving&#xD;
ourselves, preserve the duke.'&#xD;
' It were dangerous,' said Gennaro, 'for&#xD;
any cause soever, to change the day or hour&#xD;
for striking: our preparations are made for&#xD;
the Carnival night-our men have been told&#xD;
to look forward to that night for the -signal&#xD;
-their minds have no other thought. To&#xD;
change the time, or for an earlier hour or&#xD;
Iater, would change their thoughts, mar&#xD;
their plans, and perhaps chill their patriot-&#xD;
ism. Knowing the minds of the rude ones&#xD;
in our section, I think a change would be&#xD;
dangerous to the cause.'&#xD;
&#xD;
W W ell, we'll let it pass,' said Galliano,&#xD;
gloomily. 'Row in ; perhaps' fortune may&#xD;
save the old man without our aid. I shall&#xD;
not see ye again till the last meeting night,&#xD;
when, if fortune fail me not, I shall bring ye&#xD;
a proselyte ye little dream of. Row in.'&#xD;
The gondola was turned toward the shore;&#xD;
and, as it flew over the waters, a huge&#xD;
crowd was seen congregating on the pier&#xD;
from whence our heroes started.&#xD;
'Something is going on there,' said the&#xD;
noble, in an excited tone. 'I know not what&#xD;
it is, but my heart misgives me!  On your&#xD;
lives;'row in!'&#xD;
The gondoliers needed but little bidding:&#xD;
for that natural fear wh ich creeps over men&#xD;
when conscious that those they love may be&#xD;
in jeopardy, lent fiery strength'to their arms&#xD;
tand sped their bark with the speed of light-&#xD;
ning to the pier.&#xD;
The noble sprang hastily from the boat,&#xD;
and made his way through the crowd; and,&#xD;
when his companions had neared the spot&#xD;
on which he stood, they beheld him stand-&#xD;
ing in triumph over the prostrate figure of&#xD;
one well known to, and loathed by, every son&#xD;
of Venice--Leonardo Foscari!&#xD;
'Coward! dastard!' exclaimed the excited&#xD;
noble,waving aloft the sword he had wrench-&#xD;
ed from the prostrate roue, care acts like&#xD;
these the charters for thy manhood ? Hast&#xD;
thou neither soul, nor honor, nor shame left&#xD;
in thy foul, filthy carcase, but thou must play&#xD;
the dog for ever? What! steal women from&#xD;
their homes by night, when their defenders&#xD;
are away and beyond their cries! Take&#xD;
that, cowardly slayer ' and as he spoke, the&#xD;
foot of the excited and indignant noble was&#xD;
plunged into the side of the wretch ; ';take&#xD;
that!' he added, 'and bear it as a living&#xD;
mark of thy unworthiness to be punished by&#xD;
the sword!'&#xD;
The miserable wretch groaned at the pain&#xD;
inflicted upon his person, and gasped with a&#xD;
demon's passion. Starting up, he ran up the&#xD;
pier with wild and hurried speed, and utter-&#xD;
s ing threats of vengeance.&#xD;
All gave way fearfully before him, and&#xD;
many of the crowd, fearing lest spying eyes&#xD;
should be upon them, stole from the spot&#xD;
noiselessly, and soon were lost from view.&#xD;
Ere those who remained had time to-recov-&#xD;
er from the sudden and startling incidents,&#xD;
the young noble, his companions and two&#xD;
young female forms were seen in the gondo-&#xD;
la, and rowing fast from the shore. ,&#xD;
The forms on the pier, as if aware of the&#xD;
danger of being found there after such a&#xD;
scene, were soon scattered over otner parts&#xD;
of the city, and the quay was'deserted, all&#xD;
wondering when Venice would be like the&#xD;
Venice of olden time, free from broil and ty.&#xD;
ranny and wrong.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
THtE EXPLANATION.&#xD;
The boat swept over the water, liie a oird&#xD;
fleeing from the deadly gun of the sports.&#xD;
man. A little island, containing about an&#xD;
hundred houses, was the spot to which Ine&#xD;
bow of the gondola was directed. Having&#xD;
reached a broad stair flight, the rescued&#xD;
females were hastily landed, and, escorted&#xD;
by the noble, borne to an obscure looking&#xD;
dwelling on the eastern part of the isle. The&#xD;
gondoliers, immediately afterward, released&#xD;
their bark, and, again plying their oars,&#xD;
pulled for an island about three hundred&#xD;
yards distant ; on reaching which, they&#xD;
pulled their boat ashore, and, covering it&#xD;
with a quantity of old canvass,-thus giving,&#xD;
it the appearance of a boat which had 'ain&#xD;
there for some days-fledhastily, to a low-&#xD;
looking shed about forty paces distant from&#xD;
the shore. Tihey were met at the door by&#xD;
one of their own caste and costume, tu whom&#xD;
they hurriedly related the cause of their sud-&#xD;
den appearance, and witu whom they im-&#xD;
mediately departed to another dwelling, of&#xD;
the same rude caste, in another part of the&#xD;
Island.&#xD;
Return we now to the rescuer and the&#xD;
rescued.&#xD;
When they had reached the dwelling, the&#xD;
noble conducted the females into a neatly&#xD;
furnished apartment on the second floor,&#xD;
where, after pointing out to them a secret&#xD;
door, and discovering to them the manner&#xD;
of its opening, in case of a surprise, lie left&#xD;
them, saying that he would soon return.&#xD;
Descending the staircase, the noble entered&#xD;
the front apa-tment, where he was met by&#xD;
a middle-aged man, whose costume at once&#xD;
proclaimed his calling.&#xD;
'Ho, good nster goldsmitfisaid the&#xD;
noble, smiling, 'I have used the privilege&#xD;
thou gavest me-and, lot thy chambers are&#xD;
in my possession. Two fair beings, whose&#xD;
misfortunes and persecutions are only equal-&#xD;
led by their beauty, are now in thy charge.'&#xD;
'Aught in my humble power to serve them,&#xD;
shall be heartily given my lord !' replied the&#xD;
goldsmith.&#xD;
' At another time, my good friend, I will&#xD;
tell thee of the cause of niy sudden appear-&#xD;
ance here, and of-the wherefore of my guar-&#xD;
dianship of the ladies who now lodge be-&#xD;
neath thy honest roof.'&#xD;
' It matters not, my lord,' replied the gold-&#xD;
smith; 'that they are under your protection&#xD;
is sufficient for me that they are ladies of&#xD;
worth. How speeds the cause?'&#xD;
'Bravely! our next meeting will make the&#xD;
most sanguine of us leap for rapture. Mean-&#xD;
while, thy lady will do me honor' and great&#xD;
service by keeping close the fact of her luowl-&#xD;
edge of our fair unfortunates.'&#xD;

&#xD;
'Etiough, t y honest friend. A's time is&#xD;
precious, and as my fair friends may nped my&#xD;
presence for a few minutes, I'll take my&#xD;
leave.'&#xD;
The noble hurried up stairs.&#xD;
Ihabel and Eugenia were in tears, by the&#xD;
window, as he entered.&#xD;
' What! weeping, fair ones!' he exclaim-&#xD;
ed, taking a seat near them. ' Shall the vil-&#xD;
lain have it to boast that he can make us all&#xD;
weep, whene'er he lists ?  Nay, cease, as ye&#xD;
love me! I ne'er'could bide the sight of tears&#xD;
-they rob me of my manhood, and turn me&#xD;
back, in years and feeling, to a weak and&#xD;
timid child.'&#xD;
' Have we not .cause for weepiig ?' said&#xD;
Isabel.&#xD;
' N-y, I'm no woman and cannot answer&#xD;
thee,' said Galliano, with a smile. 'Men&#xD;
thinly not of weeping o'er a wrong-they re-&#xD;
;ress it straight, and, in the joy o'er revenge,&#xD;
laugh till all remembrance of the deed is&#xD;
swept away. But tell me, lady, how it&#xD;
chanced I found ye so far from that asylum&#xD;
in which I placed vou. Methought my meas-&#xD;
ures for preservirng you from all further per-&#xD;
secution b  Foscari were mist effective.'&#xD;
The orange girl blushed, and exclaimed,&#xD;
'The fault was mine, my lord, and on me&#xD;
let your anger fall.'&#xD;
' Nay, fair trembler,' responded the noble,&#xD;
'your severe sufferings swallow up all an-&#xD;
ger. Give me to know how it all hath&#xD;
chanced, that I may take warning and pre-&#xD;
vent the further visits of the princely liber-&#xD;
tine.'                         .&#xD;
'The night was fair,' said Isabel, 'and,&#xD;
weary of our room, we sought the garden.&#xD;
A small arbor invited us, where, as we in-&#xD;
haled the evening ether, Nwe spoke of our&#xD;
several destinies, our past, our present, and&#xD;
our future. While speaking thus, a strain&#xD;
of music, proceeding from the garden next&#xD;
our own, fell upon our ears. We paused to&#xD;
listen ; anon, arose, and Ppproaching the&#xD;
fence, drank in the sounds of the melodious&#xD;
instrument, till our souls forgot their woes&#xD;
and were wrapt in bliss. Thus we stood,&#xD;
entranced, when he, Foscari, suddenly stood&#xD;
before us. Palsied, by fear, we scarce could&#xD;
speak ; and when our tongues had found free&#xD;
utterance, we were being dragged from out&#xD;
house of refuge to the beach. We screamed&#xD;
and struggled, but none came to our aid. for&#xD;
the villain had a band of fierce and armed&#xD;
knaves around him, whose 'bright sword&#xD;
awed the few whom we encountered on out&#xD;
way. Brought to the beach, we were hur&#xD;
ried into a boat, filled with stalwart ant&#xD;
masked rowers, whose stout arms soon bor&#xD;
us far from shore. The wretches gagge&#xD;
us to silence our screams, while he, th&#xD;
chief? villain, held our arms, and with insult&#xD;
ing words bade us struggle not, or we should&#xD;
be plunged into the deep. We were silent&#xD;
unresisting, till we were landed. A crow&#xD;
was gathered round the pier; and in thi&#xD;
&#xD;
hope that some brave hearts would attempt&#xD;
our rescue, we screamed and struggled as&#xD;
they bore us up the pier. Nor were we&#xD;
mistaken: for our young friend, Calvari, was&#xD;
among the crowd; who, recognising our&#xD;
voices, and divining the rank and intentions&#xD;
of our abductors, rushed boldLy forward, and&#xD;
felled the foremost wretch, who held us, to&#xD;
the earth. The rest catching the spirit of&#xD;
his courage and enthusiasm, rallied to our&#xD;
defence. Foscari, at length declared his&#xD;
name and rank, and bade them stand tack&#xD;
on peril of their lives. They all gave way&#xD;
but Calvari, who, fearless of every thing but&#xD;
our danger, seized me and bade the villains&#xD;
do their worst. The wretches paused, fear-&#xD;
ing lest the crowd should fall on them again;&#xD;
when Foscari, rushing forward and dealing&#xD;
him a blow, commanded his myrmidons to&#xD;
seize and bear us to the palace. They hesi-&#xD;
ta-.ed, and he, to inspire them, seized us,&#xD;
and, bidding the crowd give way, was&#xD;
dragging us onward, when your timely&#xD;
arrival saved us from further outrage, and&#xD;
punished the foul dastard.'&#xD;
' Enough! enough!' said the noble, gaily&#xD;
yea, more than enough,' he muttered tc&#xD;
himself,' I thought him base before, but&#xD;

and rising;'the suddenness of cur flight and&#xD;
this change in your abode will baffle the&#xD;
vigilance of the keen villain. A few days&#xD;
and all shall be quiet, all at rest. Our friend,&#xD;

your guardians in my absence. Every thing&#xD;
necessary to your well-being will be by them&#xD;

cavaliers as dangerous as the gay Foscari.o&#xD;
And now,' he took their hands, and his voice&#xD;
faltered as he spoke, 'farewell! .'for five&#xD;

CHAPTER XV&#xD;
THE L &amp;amp;ST .MEETING OF THE CONSPIRAToRs.&#xD;
It was the night before the Carnival.&#xD;
Scarce a heart in Venice but bounded with&#xD;
anticipative delight ; scarce a maid but had&#xD;
spent the day in searching the city wide for&#xD;
gaudy trinkets, bright colors and attractive&#xD;
gauds; scarce a youth but tried every depot&#xD;
of second-rate clothes for the fancy attire he&#xD;
would weer on the succeeding night. The&#xD;
merchant's clerk, the artisan's apprentice,&#xD;
the merry-hearted bachelor, yea, and the&#xD;
churchman, too, burned impatiently for the&#xD;
darkness of the coming day, when all Venice&#xD;
should be alive with mirth, joy, frolic and&#xD;
gladsomeness. Every where the needle was&#xD;
plying with wonderful rapidity, every where&#xD;
the hammer fell on the rivet, every where&#xD;
the jest and loud laugh rang forth, as the&#xD;
sports of the Carnival darted in anticipation&#xD;
through the minds of the gay. The streets'&#xD;
and shops swarmed with runners and buyers&#xD;
of every sex. Already the sports of the&#xD;
laughter loving and mirth-provoking had&#xD;
commenced. Torches floated through the&#xD;
city, borne by the hands of gay apprentices,&#xD;
nerry-hearted clerks, and young gondoliers,&#xD;
at the head of motley processions and roving&#xD;
groups. From their casements, maidens.&#xD;
preparing for the Carnival, peeped forth a&#xD;
moment upon some gay and boisterous&#xD;
throng, then hurried back to their needle-&#xD;
work to make up for the misspent time.&#xD;
Sober citizens, whose reverend tongues two&#xD;
hours before pronounced the cause of mirth&#xD;
an absurd and ridiculous farce, unworthy to&#xD;
'te ever looked upon by men of sense or&#xD;
years, by some strange means lost their pre-&#xD;
judicial notions, and slowly approached their&#xD;
windows, where, like men, who are not fond&#xD;
of roaming from spot to spot without suffi-&#xD;
cient inducements, they quietly remained,-&#xD;
not to look upon the roysterers, of course not,&#xD;
-and some how or other their eyes were di-&#xD;
rected towards the motley groups passing by,&#xD;
without the slightest sign that they beheld&#xD;
them. Jealous minds would perhaps assert&#xD;
that they loved, and were -infected by, the&#xD;
general mirth ; but, psha! old men's blood&#xD;
warmed by the follies of youth !&#xD;
Men, with merry faces and laughing eyes,&#xD;
.albeit when they deemed none were looking&#xD;
on, were not so merry in their features, or&#xD;
youthful in their steps-men, we say, many&#xD;
&#xD;
~1&#xD;
&#xD;
of them, old men, yea, and young men, too,&#xD;
sped hastily through the streets, as if irr&#xD;
great anxiety to meet *a fellow wight in&#xD;
pleasure. There was a peculiarity about&#xD;
these men: a certain fixedness, or earnest-&#xD;
ness, in C iir gait and features, which would&#xD;
have irvtommended' them to the close in-&#xD;
spectirm of an observing eye, even on such&#xD;
a nignr as the eve   before the Carnivat.&#xD;
There was a certain   estlessnessmin their&#xD;
eyes,-a sharp prying all around then as&#xD;
they sped on, as if half fearful of being sur-&#xD;
prised, or. watched, or followed Ly those&#xD;
they loved not, or at least had no ver great&#xD;
affection for. Soraething more than pleasure&#xD;
produced this incessant,-tnis great anxiety&#xD;
to reach their goal unnoticed. By a strange&#xD;
mystery, too, these men all bent their steps&#xD;
in the same direction-that is, towards St.&#xD;
Mark's Square, and there they disappeared.&#xD;
A man might walk beside you for a mo-&#xD;
ment; your eyes bent forward, in thought,&#xD;
perhaps, on the words which have fallen&#xD;
from his lips. Perhaps you are answering&#xD;
a reply ; ere your speech is finished, lo I you&#xD;
are alone!&#xD;
You are in St. Mark's Square ; hundreds&#xD;
on hundreds are playing merry feats, and&#xD;
setting hundreds on hundreds of others in a&#xD;
roar. Some of the windows are illuminated&#xD;
while from others, young and aged faces&#xD;
are gazing upon the sights below. One by&#xD;
one the spectators withdrew, till scarce one&#xD;
half of the original number remained. Where&#xD;
are they ? The hour of eleven approaches,&#xD;
and the actors are surprised to find they out-&#xD;
number their auditors. Where are the lat-&#xD;
ter ? Gone to their homes ?&#xD;
In a vault of some two hundred and eighty&#xD;
feet in length and about one hundred and&#xD;
twenty in breadth, were assembled a host&#xD;
(for they were countless) ')f masks. Skull&#xD;
caps adorned their , heads, hiding the dark&#xD;
and gray locks of eveiy member of the as-&#xD;
semblage. A ho, ', we say, a host of mask-&#xD;
ed heads. Their forms were dominoed, so&#xD;
that it was impossible to catch the slightest&#xD;
sight of the gear they wore. Like one&#xD;
massive body of human forms conjoined they&#xD;
seemed, as they stood in close. proximity to&#xD;
each other fromwall to wall of the long,&#xD;
broad vault. A sea of human heads, silent&#xD;
and breathless as that assembly of old which&#xD;
waited the moment of the tyrant's entrance&#xD;
into the imperial hall of the capitoline city&#xD;
that each ' might kill his share of him.'&#xD;
Silent were they, as if on each one's&#xD;
speechlessness depended the lives of the uni-&#xD;
ted throng. In one direction their eyes were&#xD;
turned, and there, on a rough and tempora-&#xD;
ry stage, an altar stood ; a lamp, with five&#xD;
burners, suspended from the ceiling, threw&#xD;
a bright glare on the open leaves of a writ-&#xD;
ten volume, whose characters symbolic, to-&#xD;
gether with a bare dagger, a slkull on each&#xD;
side of the book, struck awe into every heart&#xD;
of that mighty throng. Grim andgaunt and&#xD;

&#xD;
THE ORANGE MIRL OF VENICE.&#xD;
&#xD;
terrific, yea, and majestic was that altar. In l&#xD;
gazing on't, and on its eloquent symbols, a a&#xD;
thrill ran through the multitude, enthusias- b&#xD;
tic as that of the pious pilgrim who has t&#xD;
spent months in weary travel to his favorite g&#xD;
shrine..&#xD;
On one side of the altar, and in view of t&#xD;
the while assemblage, sat a masked figure,&#xD;
with a large volume before him, over hoses.&#xD;
pages he appeared to be absorbed in patriot-&#xD;
ic earnestness.- Like the rest of the assem--r&#xD;
bly, he wore a domino, which enveloped him&#xD;
from head to foot. The excitement was high, t&#xD;
as was evinced by the quick breathings t&#xD;
which, like the first swell of ocean, ever andc&#xD;
anon, rose up and fell back into the bosom&#xD;
of the throng.                  -       I&#xD;
Why was that multitude so silentT Fear- f&#xD;
ed they speech would betray them, if they I&#xD;
dared to use it?  Or, tarried they a leader f&#xD;
to open their proceedings ? The hour is late,c&#xD;
and yet, though the assembly is huge beyond&#xD;
conception, no word bath been spoken, noI&#xD;
form of meeting opened.&#xD;
Hark ! a sound as of a muffled gong! lo!&#xD;
the assemblage breathe freer-that sound, -&#xD;
what doth it betoken ?&#xD;
Lo! the front of the altar sinks, and within&#xD;
two forms are seen. Their rank is noble,I&#xD;
or else nature hath made men wear the as-E&#xD;
pect of nobility, without the silken charter&#xD;
given by manto man to proclaim him above&#xD;
the common herd. Hark to that shout, deaf-&#xD;
ening as the sudden peal which the dark&#xD;
and angry clouds roll forth, when the ele-&#xD;
ments would fling the Fear pall over the&#xD;
hearts of the Triune's images. Again the&#xD;
peal rings forth as if to split the earth above&#xD;
into countless fragments. - And now, lo I a&#xD;
masked bu-t gallant form enters from the&#xD;
altar's bosom, leading a weak and tremulous&#xD;
companion into the presence of the mighty&#xD;
throng. The face of the latter is bare, and&#xD;
on his reverend brow and cheeks a tale of&#xD;
recent and terrible agony is written, as if&#xD;
the veil which hides the caves of the Infer-&#xD;
nal King from human vision had been opened&#xD;
to him alone of all the breathers this side&#xD;
the abyss of the Eternities.  The shout&#xD;
of the multitude ceases on his appearance,&#xD;
and mouths are agape with wonder. Mur-&#xD;
murs run through the vault, and whispers&#xD;
of half-believed treachery are audible. Con-&#xD;
cealed knives are half-drawn from their&#xD;
sheaths, and half-suppressed mutterings tell&#xD;
the danger of the new comer.&#xD;
The younger raises his hand aloft-and&#xD;
now, the murmurs cease, the daggers ire&#xD;
returned to their sheaths, and marvel takes&#xD;
the place of audible suspicion.&#xD;
The old man casts his eyes around the&#xD;
mighty throng, but masks-masks--masks&#xD;
greet his vision on every hand. His cheek -&#xD;
is pale with suffering, not fear. His limbs&#xD;
are tremulous, and his lips in vain assay to&#xD;
speak,&#xD;
His younger and more hardy companion&#xD;
&#xD;
eads him to a seat on the right of'the altar,&#xD;
nd, like a son humoring the whims )f a fee-&#xD;
le-minded parent, fears not, in sight of a&#xD;
housand eyes, to do each little act which&#xD;
ives relief 6r feeds the humor of his sire.&#xD;
Aind now that kindness is acknowledged by&#xD;
he throng, for lo! how Iustily they shout.&#xD;
The hand of the mask s raised again-&#xD;
he assemblage is dumb.&#xD;
' Hark! to the voice of the swayer of the,&#xD;
multitude:&#xD;
' Venetians, ye must not deem me faithless&#xD;
to the post which ye have honored me with,&#xD;
because of the lateness of my arrival at this&#xD;
our last, most solemn meeting. But when&#xD;
ye have heard the cause of my detention, ye&#xD;
will pardon my lateness. Ye know well the&#xD;
features of yon old man-ye have known, je&#xD;
have felt, his kindness, justice and humanity&#xD;
for years, when the dark power, for whose&#xD;
destruction we are now assembled, held over&#xD;
us the hidden steel and midnight summons.&#xD;
Look on him, pity him, for he ha'h suffered,&#xD;
-welcome him, for I bring him to ye as a&#xD;
candidate for your voices.&#xD;
' For the last five days, he hath suffered the&#xD;
infernal torments which only the Fiends of&#xD;
Venice are capable of inflicting upon man,&#xD;
On a base, false and cowardly charge he was&#xD;
summoned at midnight, by the dark messen-&#xD;
ger of the Tribunal to appear before the&#xD;
" Ten" and answer to charges which none&#xD;
but a devil could invent. He was tried, con-&#xD;
demned, and sentenced to the "Sulphur&#xD;
Death." Venitians, he is your doge-ye are&#xD;
his loyal subjects, and, now, fresh from the&#xD;
dungeon's torture, he comes tojoin us in our&#xD;
battle with the foes of liberty and conscience.&#xD;
Shall lie be one of us ? it is for your voices&#xD;
to decide whether our cause shall be aided&#xD;
by the influence and worth of one so patent-&#xD;
as our doge.'&#xD;
' Who will vouch for his honesty ?' de-&#xD;
manded a voice, in the throng. '&#xD;
- 'Galliano,' responded the noble, boldly.&#xD;
A look of gratitude from the aged victim&#xD;
rewarded the young noble's generosity.&#xD;
' Shall be be one of us?' demanded Galli-&#xD;
ano, energetically ; 'shall we proceed in the&#xD;
coming struggle with a star- at our side,&#xD;
whose fame as a warrior, a statesman and&#xD;
a man hath never been' excelled by the&#xD;
brightest of our country's sons ? Shall we&#xD;
go forth, with this brave man and true, this&#xD;
great man and good, this sage and warrior,,&#xD;
at our head, or shall we, trusting to his hon-&#xD;
or for fidelity, let him depart, to be again&#xD;
seized by the dark Tribunal, a victim to its&#xD;
rapac.ty. It is for you to say whether he&#xD;
shall become one of us, and live ; or, return&#xD;
to the vengeance of the "Ten," and die!'&#xD;
The assembly was silent.&#xD;
'Your signal, friends, your signal,' cried&#xD;
the noble.&#xD;
Every right hand of the throng was raised&#xD;
aloft.&#xD;
" Enough, friends-I thank ye.  Then&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ORANGE 31&#xD;
turning to the pale doge, the noble added-&#xD;
'Father of Venice, Jacopo the Just, it is the&#xD;
pleasure of these worthy citizens that you be&#xD;
admitted into our holy cause. Thou will&#xD;
now prepare to take the initiatory.oath ; it&#xD;
is a solemn and an holy one, and he who&#xD;
breaks it, forfeits all right to honor, man-&#xD;
ihood, y ea, and life. Art thou willing to&#xD;
ru m uch haard P                    '&#xD;
4I am,' replied the old man, firmly.&#xD;
S 'Then arise, and take thy stand with me&#xD;
beside this altar.'&#xD;
The doge obeyed.&#xD;
'Lay thy hand upon this holy volume,'&#xD;
added the noble, 'and follow me in the oath.'&#xD;
i"By all my hopes of life on earth-by all&#xD;
the ties that bind me to kindred, friends and&#xD;
tountry-by all my hopes of, heaven and&#xD;
fears of hell-I swear to be faithful and true&#xD;
to the cause of which I am a brother ; to&#xD;
hold myself in readiness to follow the orders&#xD;
of my officers ; to aid my brother members&#xD;
when in suffering or in danger ; to be ready at&#xD;
all hours, whenever summoned, to carry out&#xD;
the object of our institution-to keep secret&#xD;
its secrets, to keep secret its proceedings, to&#xD;
keep secret the names of its members, to&#xD;
keep secret its place of meeting-to advance&#xD;
its power, influence and number by every&#xD;
means in the power of my hands, mind and&#xD;
tongue. To give of my means and abun-&#xD;
daice all that can be given, to sustain and&#xD;
strengthen our institution ; to obey when&#xD;
ordered, though it were to sacrifice my dear-&#xD;
est friends, my kindred in blood, or though&#xD;
it were to jeopardise mine own life. To&#xD;
Iknow no object in precedence of this-to&#xD;
obey its officers, though to obey. were peril&#xD;
beyond conception. This do I' swear, in&#xD;
sight of heaven and earth, and will main-&#xD;
tain my oath before the courts of Life, Death&#xD;
or Darkness !"&#xD;
Word for word, with trenbling lips, the&#xD;
dogs followed the speaker, till the last word&#xD;
ef the fearful and responsible oath was&#xD;
tiuttered.&#xD;
Then advanced the secretary with his&#xD;
leger. Laying it on the altar, he opened its&#xD;
pges, saying-' Thy name&#xD;
'For what?' demanded the doge.&#xD;
'This book doth bear the name of every&#xD;
member of our order, sil-ned, or marked, by&#xD;
his own hand,' responded the secretary.&#xD;
'Give me the pen,' said the duke, huskily.&#xD;
It was put into his hand.&#xD;
Why paused he? His son was one of the&#xD;
creatures of the itTen"-the " Ten" were&#xD;
ITible in their decrees, terrible in their&#xD;
tu tures-but his son was allied to them-&#xD;
if the "Ten" were destroyed, his son, his&#xD;
darling, spoiled, but yet his son, would be&#xD;
swept away with them. He had suffered&#xD;
by both, terribly suffered-but he was a&#xD;
ii'her, and had a father's feelings. E'en&#xD;
aol', if his Leonardo stood before him, for&#xD;
all his wickedness of heart, be felt he coud&#xD;
forgive him, wholly, yea, heartily forgive&#xD;
&#xD;
LL OF VENICE.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
him. Though his son had forgot his duties,&#xD;
his loyalty, his manliness, his affection, still&#xD;
there *as yet a pleader for him in his fa-&#xD;
ther's heart. He knew his boy to be mark-&#xD;
ed-that many a heart in that tirong thirsted&#xD;
for hisblood,4nd viould have it,-and yet&#xD;
he, a father, was about to join a band of&#xD;
men whose solimn purpose wa to dlay, it&#xD;
cold blood, suddenly, and at midnight, the&#xD;
protectors of his son. He felt his eyes grow&#xD;
dim-he could not see the book before him,&#xD;
his band trembled.&#xD;
' Why dost thou pause?' said the noble.&#xD;
The lips of the doge moved, but no sound&#xD;
issued forth.&#xD;
' The torture hath done its work upon&#xD;
him,' thought the noble.&#xD;
'He fears to sign, but he has taken the&#xD;
oath,' shouted a voice.&#xD;
He must sign, or die, doge or no doge,'&#xD;
shouted another.&#xD;
' Aye, he must,' echoed an hundred voices,&#xD;
at once.&#xD;
' Silence!' thundered Gralliano, indignant-&#xD;
ly ; ' think ye the .old man means us treach-&#xD;
ery ? For shame ! Scarce two hours have&#xD;
flown, since I, with the connivance of one&#xD;
of the Tribunal's instruments, rescued him,&#xD;
stealthily, from the dungeon where he was&#xD;
to linger till murdered by the torture ! Last&#xD;
night the Tribunal stretched him on the&#xD;
rack to extort confession. 'Tis the agony&#xD;
of his tortured limbs that now makes him&#xD;
patuse. His strength is gone. Would you&#xD;
add to his sufferings by harsh, unkind re-&#xD;
pioaches?'&#xD;
The throng was silent.-&#xD;
The old man leaned against the altar, and,&#xD;
casting a look of gratitude upon his defender,&#xD;
said, feebly-' Cease*thy pleading, noble&#xD;
youth ; I am not popular with these stern&#xD;
men,and thy efforts will be of little or no avail.&#xD;
My hours are well nigh numbered,-my aid&#xD;
in your cause feeble, no matter how heartily&#xD;
given. Still, go on; go on, with an old&#xD;
man's dying blessing. Rid Venice of its&#xD;
plague-sweep them off, and be freemen&#xD;
once more. Posterity will do your efforts&#xD;
justice, whether fruitless or successful. If&#xD;
you succeed, go at once into an election and&#xD;
create your doge. Let the people's choice&#xD;
live and reign for the people; not for him-&#xD;
self, but for the great body of Venice, I-&#xD;
I-.'              N&#xD;
His voice had now sunk to a whisper.&#xD;
Galliano rushed toward and supported him&#xD;
from falling.&#xD;
The secretary ran, and, throwing the old&#xD;
man's right shoulder over his neck,sustained&#xD;
him on one side, as the young noble did the&#xD;
-same on the otaer.&#xD;
,Thus supported, - the doge, turning his&#xD;
face toward the throng, and, running his&#xD;
eyes over the multitude, as if to command&#xD;
.their attention, said, in a tone feeble, but&#xD;
whisperingly audible. 'Venetians, you need&#xD;

&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
as if the Eternal's voice had turned it into&#xD;
aark and solid glass ; the atmosphere was&#xD;
deadly calm and hot.&#xD;
The piers of Venice were crowded with&#xD;
continually-arriving boats from the numer-.&#xD;
ous isles around ; the streets were thronged&#xD;
with citizens an:~ strangers, all attended by&#xD;
se-vant- bearing flambeaux, and all hurry-&#xD;
:ng toward 8t. Mark's Square. Torches and&#xD;
.imp festooned, hung beneath the windows&#xD;
of ever house; music, frotn a thousand in-&#xD;
struments, greeted the comers, now issuing&#xD;
from every corner, in the square.&#xD;
The street from side to side, was floored&#xD;
with ciese-grooved planks, and rendered&#xD;
slippery as glass by holistone ; and caulirus&#xD;
was the foot that did not fall.  Shoes,&#xD;
sandals, boots, slippers, and chopines, were&#xD;
chalked by the knowing ones ; while those&#xD;
who visited the scene for the first time, af-&#xD;
forded.great diversion by their numerous falls&#xD;
and award attempts to preserve their equil-&#xD;
ibrium.-&#xD;
The sports commenced by th'e entrance of&#xD;
an hundred morris dancers, all dressed in&#xD;
tight-fitting pantaloons and jackets, with nu-&#xD;
merous small bells attached to their steeple&#xD;
caps and belted waists. Their grotesque&#xD;
dance being finished, and confidence implant-&#xD;
ed in the breasts of the over-modest, the hi-&#xD;
larity of the Carnival began. Clowns, sober&#xD;
citizens, monkeys, villagers, tigers, usurers&#xD;
and monks, all'joined in one mirthful set.&#xD;
each figure dancing as closely as possible, in&#xD;
imitation of the tiing whose character he&#xD;
represented.&#xD;
The heat was oppressive, and cunnning&#xD;
wights, taking advantage of the holitime,&#xD;
carried about water and choice wines, for&#xD;
which, receiving whatever they demanded,&#xD;
they made enough t6 pay for the time lost&#xD;
in preparing, and the expense incurred in&#xD;
costuming for the gay holitime.&#xD;
Nuns, with every thing but nun-like steps,&#xD;
might be seen, arm-in-arm, with a soldier ;&#xD;
a tiger with a monkey on his back, the mon-&#xD;
key doing the roaring part, and the tiger,&#xD;
both through mistake, performing the mon-&#xD;
key's squeak; a burly monk with huge chops&#xD;
and laughter-loving eyes, dancing a comic,&#xD;
ecuplet with a gay shepherdees ; a king&#xD;
footing it with a huge, greasy looking cook;&#xD;
and ten thousand other fantastic and laugh-&#xD;
able vagaries might be witnessed, as the&#xD;
sports and crowd increased.&#xD;
The bell of St. Mark's temple struck the&#xD;
midnight signal ; and, ere its sound had died&#xD;
away, the darkness was changed to the light&#xD;
of day, by the sudden discharge of a thousand&#xD;
rockets, fr-am all pvrts of the torch-lit square.&#xD;
This lasted for about uve-minutes, in which&#xD;
time a countless host of caps were raised&#xD;
aloft on poles,,and swung round, in-tle'air,&#xD;
amidst deafening shouts.&#xD;
Fediers of food and wine and water were&#xD;
now seen busily disposing of their articles&#xD;
to the hungry and thirsty, while the thou-&#xD;
&#xD;
sand antics of the merry throng kept the&#xD;
pave alive with boisterous delight&#xD;
The throng continued to increase,-the&#xD;
dancers and spectators to grow nearer and&#xD;
nearer to each other; till there was scarce&#xD;
space enough for the trippers to obey the&#xD;
music. At last, on6 merry wight bethought&#xD;
him of a schenle to clear the pave, and, a&#xD;
few moments afterward, a bare was seen&#xD;
rolling from the top of the square, with&#xD;
frightful rapidity, from either end-of which&#xD;
shot forth, like fire rockets, numerous fla-&#xD;
ming balls, scattering the crowd and dancers&#xD;
in every direction. But the balls were harm-&#xD;
less, doing no other mischief than that of&#xD;
frightening the astonished multitude, amidst&#xD;
peals of laughter.&#xD;
A tall form stood A the door of a two-&#xD;
story house, opposite the temple ofSt. Mark,&#xD;
scanning, with scowling' brows, the figures&#xD;
of the merry multitude. The house before&#xD;
wbich ,he stood had nothing in it to distin-&#xD;
guish it from the buildings on eitWer side&#xD;
of it, except indeed that its facade was hum-&#xD;
bler in its pretensions. It was an ordinary&#xD;
building, and free from all the fancy stucco&#xD;
and carved work which distinguished the&#xD;
majority of the dwellings in St. Mark's&#xD;
Square. It appeared to be the residence&#xD;
of some wealthy, but unpretending citizen!&#xD;
and had nothing' to recommend it to the&#xD;
passing eye, but its simplicity. The indi-&#xD;
vidual alluded to, was young in years, gay&#xD;
in his labiliments, handsome in figure and&#xD;
features, and evidently one who had to small&#xD;
opinion of his own importance.&#xD;
His eyes were every where; but an eye&#xD;
was on him, that he little dreamt of; an&#xD;
eye, dark, large, sharp and piercing as his&#xD;
own. Having satisfied his curiosity, and&#xD;
growing tired of gazing on sports in which&#xD;
neither his humor nor pride would permit&#xD;
him to mingle, he opened the door cautious-&#xD;
ly, though in an apparently careless manner,&#xD;
and disappeared. Whether he had received&#xD;
a signal, invisible to all but himself, to hurry&#xD;
him from th'e scene where he was only a&#xD;
spectator, or whether he retired to avoid the&#xD;
eve or presence of some approaching foe, it&#xD;
matters not-he retired, and, a few moments&#xD;
afterward, a fancy masque was being played&#xD;
almost in front of the house, which was so&#xD;
attractive that hundreds, aye hundreds on&#xD;
hundreds, gathered around to witness it.&#xD;
They gathered around to witness the&#xD;
mask, we say ; but, many, instead ot remain.&#xD;
ing to feast'their eyes upon the farce gradu-&#xD;
ally drew back, and one by one, disappeared&#xD;
throughh the very  door which the pcrsonage&#xD;
before mentioned had entered. The mirth&#xD;
of the masque was at its height-the spec-&#xD;
tators were splitting their sides with laugh-&#xD;
ter,-their eves were.bent upon each feature&#xD;
of the gay performance, when, lo! hundreds&#xD;
fell back, just as unpropped earth gives way&#xD;
before the press 6f dampness and approach-&#xD;
ed the onetted door.  They disappeared&#xD;

' Confess the name of thy accomplice, and&#xD;

Still the prisoner uttered not a word.&#xD;
*Confe'ss, ere I give the sign,' thundered&#xD;
'he President.&#xD;
' I laugh at thee and thy threats, villain,'&#xD;
respontled the prisoner.,&#xD;
The Council rose in agitation, and hastily&#xD;
collkcted round the prostrate man.&#xD;
In faith, they had good cause for trem-&#xD;
bling; a traitor was within their gates, or&#xD;
else the secret of the entrance to their dun-&#xD;
geons was knevn to some daring one un-&#xD;
known to the Tribunal. Hethe doge, their&#xD;
hst and highest victim, had found some&#xD;
secret means of escaping his dungeon; true,&#xD;
they had. re-captured him, at dawn, as he&#xD;
was stealing, with a companion, through a&#xD;
bye-path, near St. Mark's cathedral, into the&#xD;
rear of the gardens of the ducal palace: still,&#xD;
the secret of the entrance was known to&#xD;
Another than themselves. This fact troubled&#xD;
them, and to find out the name of the being&#xD;
possessing this mighty and dangerous secret,&#xD;
caused the Tribunal to dally with their vic-&#xD;
tim ere they resorted to the last deadly&#xD;
measure.&#xD;
'Confess, anal save thy life,' said the Pre-&#xD;
sident; 'give us but the name of him our&#xD;
spies found thee with this morn, and thou&#xD;
shalt live. Refuse, and thou shalt die.'&#xD;
'Do your worst-I'll betray no man,' re-&#xD;
plied the prisoner, firmly.&#xD;
'Beware ! our vengeance is - -&#xD;
'Laughed at, and at end,' thundered a&#xD;
voice, without.&#xD;
A moment more, and a knight, in black&#xD;
armor, his viztr down, .his sword drawn,&#xD;
and accompanied by an hundred warriors,&#xD;
in mail, each Ltaring a broad, bright blade&#xD;
in his right hand, entered the chamber, and&#xD;
confront d the astonished Tribunal.&#xD;
'Ho, there ! what treachery is this?' cried&#xD;
the President, starting back.&#xD;
'No treachery, villains !' replied the black&#xD;
knight;'we are Venetians, and your dooms-&#xD;
men! Seize them!' he added, pointing to&#xD;
his companions.&#xD;
Stand back, knaves!' pried one of the&#xD;
judges, rushing forward, his sword drawn,&#xD;
and throwing off his dominoes, 'stand back,&#xD;
as ye do value life! Give we but the signal,&#xD;
ye are on all sides hemmed in, and death,&#xD;
death in its most startling and terrible shape,&#xD;
is your portion. Think ye fo come and bcerd&#xD;

to aid thee-death, death, in its most ap-&#xD;
palling forms, have been marked out for&#xD;
thee and all thy fellow assassins! Seize&#xD;

The knights obeyed; and, in five minutes,&#xD;
every member of the Tribuual, together&#xD;
with the wretches who were about to stran-&#xD;
gle the aged man on the rack, were seized,&#xD;
bound and tied to the altar around which&#xD;
they had so often sat in sanguinary coun-&#xD;
cil.&#xD;
'Behold, my friends,' cried the black&#xD;
knight, pointing to the rack, 'behold the&#xD;
weapons of these midnight murderers. Be-&#xD;
hold the fearful engines we are called upon&#xD;
by reason, manhood, justice, aye, and fate,&#xD;
to destroy. Release yon noble victim, and&#xD;
bear him to the palace. We'll hear his&#xD;
thanks another time,' he continued with&#xD;
averted face, as the doge, freed from his&#xD;
iron manacles, was about to throw himself&#xD;
on his knees and thank his deliverers, for&#xD;
their timely arrival ; 'we'll hear his thanks&#xD;
another time. Be-.r him hence, and see him&#xD;
well attended, ere ye quit your burden.&#xD;
Away!&#xD;
' And now' continued the knight, 'pass the&#xD;
word for the oil, we'll teach these idle&#xD;
hounds the mercy they have taught to&#xD;
others.'&#xD;
The oil was brought.&#xD;
' Now, sirs,' said the black knignt, turn-&#xD;
ing to the judges, 'it is but the emptying of&#xD;
these jars upon this pave, and the touching&#xD;
of this torch to the oil, and ye are in a hu-&#xD;
man hell, built by your own death-dealing&#xD;
hands. What if we so act?'&#xD;
The judges were silent. .&#xD;
' What if, like yourselves, we, to gratify&#xD;
our thirst for blood, fire these dungeons, leav-&#xD;
ing you, 'artners in blood and iniquity, to list&#xD;
to each other's cries and shrieks and groans,&#xD;
as the flames of Vengeance hurry ye from&#xD;
this chamber of fire into that burning lake&#xD;
the other side the Eternities which ye so&#xD;
long have laughed at?'&#xD;
' Do it,' said one of the judges, sullenly;&#xD;
'we fear not.'&#xD;
' Liar that thou art,' replied the knight,&#xD;
'tis thy fear that gives thee this sad show&#xD;
of courage in the dark hour of death. Are&#xD;
ye then so brave, that ye will not ask for&#xD;
mercy ? Ho, there!' he added, turning to&#xD;
his men, 'swathe these walls with oil,&#xD;
We'll e'en burn the villains into a crisp.'&#xD;
A cry of terror,.rose from the midst of the&#xD;
captive judges, as they beheld the threat of&#xD;
their unknowncaptor being carried into ef-&#xD;
feet.&#xD;
'What! ye come to your senses at last,&#xD;
eh ' exclaimed the knight, with a derisive&#xD;
laugh ; 'ye begin at last to have a foretaste&#xD;

rXy brave hearts, seize these dastards, and&#xD;
convey them to the outer vault.'&#xD;
His command was obeyed.&#xD;
' Now then, friends,' continued the knight,&#xD;
'pass the word, to set all the captives free,&#xD;
swathe all the dungeons with oil and pitch,&#xD;
.and when we reach the outer vault, let the&#xD;
torch fire the dungeons-if possible, we'll&#xD;
end our glorious work without shedding a&#xD;
drop of human blood.'          -&#xD;
The dungeons were opened, and captive&#xD;
after captive released, till not a cell was left&#xD;
unexplored. The walls, floors, and ceilings&#xD;
were then bedaubed with oil and pitch, and&#xD;
all moved, hastily, to the outward vault.&#xD;
There the judges stood, chained, and, de-&#xD;
void of their cloaks, gazing sullenly on their&#xD;
captors,-their faces were well known, and&#xD;
the huge throng recognized many a favorite&#xD;
citizen among the now powerlessJudges.&#xD;
The black knight advanced towards one&#xD;
who bore a torch, and seizing it, cried out-&#xD;
'Seize these villains, and bear them to the&#xD;
ducal hall. Away, on your lives-,fbr the&#xD;
brand must now end these scenes of blood!'&#xD;
None needed a second bidding: and ma-&#xD;
king a rush for the stair flight, were, with&#xD;
their captives, soon beyond the reach of dan-&#xD;
.ger. The knight finding himself alone flung&#xD;
the burning torch into the narrow passage:;'&#xD;
and for a moment paused to witness the re-&#xD;
sult. The passage, swathed with oil and&#xD;
pitch, was instantaneously in a flame, and&#xD;
spreading like a sea of fire, till all before him&#xD;
was of one lurid glow. The heat drove him&#xD;
to the stair flight, where stood a large jar of&#xD;
pitch and oil. A slight push sent it into the&#xD;
vault, where it was soon caught by the ap-&#xD;
proaching fire. The danger was now evi-&#xD;
dent, and, closing the door, the black knight&#xD;
ran, with his few remaining companions, up&#xD;
stairs. A crowd was congregated without&#xD;
the door ; whichson the approach of our he-&#xD;
ro, soon gave way, and all bent their steps&#xD;
toward the palace.&#xD;
In a square phalh:.A they moved, the black&#xD;
knights in the centre, till they reached the&#xD;
ducal mansion.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
THE T RIAL.&#xD;
The reception hall of the ducal palace was&#xD;
filled to overflowing. An oaken desk, carv-&#xD;
ed in the fashion of the furniture of the&#xD;
middle ages, stood in the upper end of the&#xD;
hall. Behind it, his vizor off, and his manly&#xD;
face exposed to the full vie* of -the multi-&#xD;
tude, sat Galliano, the hero of the night.&#xD;
Ranged on either side, were twenty knights&#xD;
in black armor, each holding his helmet on&#xD;
his arm before his breast. On either end&#xD;
of the desk stood a large vaxen taper, fling-&#xD;
ing a broad light around. The captive&#xD;
&#xD;
judges were in a line befcre the desk, their&#xD;
faces toward the desk, and separated from&#xD;
the spectators by an iron railing, which ran&#xD;
from side to side of the apartment. Silence&#xD;
reigned throughout the hall.&#xD;
'Venetians,' said  Galliano, in a stern&#xD;
voice, 'the late foes of our beloved country,&#xD;
are now before you for judgment. The&#xD;
witnesses against them are your own eyes,&#xD;
and the sufferings which we all have suffer'&#xD;
ed since nature gave us breath.' Are ye&#xD;
prepared for judgment?'&#xD;
' We are,' was the reply, as with one&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
' Their crimes are known to ye-their&#xD;
villainy as plainly graven on your hearts, as&#xD;
the memory of yesterday. Speak, what is&#xD;
the doom of'the prisoners ?'&#xD;
'Death!' was the solemn response.&#xD;
'Without shriving-without preparation?'&#xD;
'Without shriving--without preparation'&#xD;
'Their mode of death?'&#xD;
'The block-the block!'F&#xD;
'When, and where?'&#xD;
'This hour, and in front of the church&#xD;
of St. Mark!'&#xD;
' Who shall be their executioner?'&#xD;
' Their chief,' was the reply again, as with&#xD;
one voice.&#xD;
' Ho, there !' exclaimed the black knight,&#xD;
rising from his seat, ' let the biall be cleared;&#xD;
and let the state block and axe, which have&#xD;
lain so long unused, be brought and' placed&#xD;
on the portico of St. Mark's. It is decreed!'&#xD;
The hall was cleared of all save the&#xD;
knights and their prisoners.&#xD;
Galliano whispered to his companions;&#xD;
on which two of them hastily left the apart.&#xD;
meant by a side door.&#xD;
Silence reigned there some half hour; at&#xD;
the expiration of which time, the knights&#xD;
returned, accompanied by a gray-haired&#xD;
priest and a mantled female.&#xD;
Galliano led the latter behind the oaken&#xD;
desk. She trembled, and would have sunk,&#xD;
had not the arm of the noble sustained her.&#xD;
' Courage, fair lady,' he whispered; 'cour-&#xD;
age, or else our pains will all be turned to&#xD;
nought. Command thy nerves with all thy&#xD;
might: harm cannot come to thee, surround-&#xD;
ed as thou art by those who know thy&#xD;
melancholy history well, and who would&#xD;
die for thee. Courage!'&#xD;
She answered not, but bent her head upon&#xD;
his arm, and wept.&#xD;
The noble made a sign to those who had&#xD;
brought the lady, and they advanced ; rcd&#xD;
signing the female to their charge, Galliana&#xD;
fixed his eye upon one of the captives, and&#xD;
said, in a deep and solemn tone: 'Leonardo&#xD;
Foscari-on the verge of eternity, as thou&#xD;
art, I summon thee in heaven's name, to do&#xD;
one act of justice, which will, in part, redeem&#xD;
the infamy thou hast brought upon thy fath-&#xD;
er's name.'&#xD;
'What is't ?' demanded Foscari, sullenly.&#xD;
'Behold this tender form,' said the noble,&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ORANGE GIRL OF VENICE.&#xD;
&#xD;
turning and pointing as he sooke, 'and let&#xD;
thy oncse noble heart answer thee.'     n&#xD;
'I am no reader of riddles,' replied the&#xD;
roue, sneeringly.                       s&#xD;
'Nor need'st thou be, to draw the mean- t&#xD;
ing I would have thee,' sai-l the noble, f&#xD;
stifling his.anger at the insolent reply. 'Lead&#xD;

knights near the prisoners.&#xD;
The ronte made no resistance.B&#xD;
'W hat think'st thou now ?' said the noble,&#xD;
lifting aside the veil which had hidden the f&#xD;
features of the female.&#xD;
'Eugenia !' exclaimed the roue, starting&#xD;
back at the pale countenance of his weeping  s&#xD;
victim.&#xD;
' The same,' said the noble, indignantly;'&#xD;
'Eugenia, the orange girl of Venice! She,c&#xD;
whom   thy false tongue did first betray&#xD;
and afterwards malign. Behold her now,t&#xD;
pale with misery and woe-behold her now,&#xD;
heart-btoken, as thou hast made her!'   I&#xD;
'Well, sir, the object of bringing us again 1&#xD;
together ? said the roue, with a sneer, and&#xD;
recovering his self-possession.&#xD;
' To urge thee to do her justice,' repliedI&#xD;
the noble, indignantly.&#xD;
' As how, my gallant lord?'&#xD;
' By wedding her, ere thou diest,"respond-I&#xD;
ed Galliano.&#xD;
The roue laughed.&#xD;
'Hast thou no heart?' said a feeble voice&#xD;
near him.&#xD;
Foscari turned pale and started-his sire&#xD;
was before him-his sire, pale with suffer-&#xD;
ing in limb and brain.&#xD;
' Hast thou no heart ?' repeated the doge,&#xD;
in a low, feeble, sad, reproachful voice ; 'hast&#xD;
ihou no heart, Leonardo?'&#xD;
The roue heard the tones of that voice, and&#xD;
saw the mighty change in that face, whose&#xD;
features almost till now were ever turned&#xD;
on him with parental love and pride. He&#xD;
shrank as he gazed, he trembled at the chang-&#xD;
ed tones of that voice, as they fell upon his&#xD;
ear-changed, too, by his own ingrate heart.&#xD;
' On the verge of that dread Eternity,&#xD;
where we soon shall meet together,' contin-&#xD;
ued the doge, 'I implore thee to do what&#xD;
good thou canst whilst yet the breath is in&#xD;
thee, by righting this poor girl. Lo! death&#xD;
is near at hand, boy, and if thoul't but do&#xD;
this one little act of justice, thy father's lips&#xD;
will pronounce his pardon for thy guilt to-&#xD;
wards him,'and his last prayer shall ascend&#xD;
to heaven for mercy on thy soul! Wilt thou&#xD;
do it ?I&#xD;
Leonardo replied not.&#xD;
' Hast thou no spark of manliness nor hon-&#xD;
or left in thee, boy?' said the 'doge, in a&#xD;
choked voice. 'Shall thy poor father go&#xD;
down intohis grave with the conviction that&#xD;
his only begotten, shamed the mather's&#xD;
breast that bore him ? Speak, Leonardo,-&#xD;
may boy-one word ! See, thy poor sire is&#xD;
on his knees before thee!'&#xD;
The eyes of the roue were 'moistened-&#xD;
&#xD;
is lips trembled-his frame shook-he spoke&#xD;
o word, but his sire had conquered.&#xD;
The roue raised his father kindly up-then&#xD;
ank at his father's feet--then seized his fa-&#xD;
her's hands in his, and implored his father's&#xD;
orgiveness.&#xD;
'W hen thou hast righted her thou hast&#xD;
vronged!' said the old man, solemnly.&#xD;
At this moment, the solenin tongue of St.&#xD;
Mark's steeple, toled a solitary chime.&#xD;
The doge staggered against the desk-his&#xD;
ace ashy, his eyes turned upward, and his&#xD;
ips murmuring-' 0 God!'&#xD;
'The lock is prepared-the axe whetted,'&#xD;
aid a solemn voice, at the door.&#xD;
What is that glossy stream now coursing&#xD;
down the old man's cheeks-tears, silent&#xD;
ones ?&#xD;
The roue advanced to the orange girl, and&#xD;
taking her hand, said, in a low, deep voice-&#xD;
' Eugenia, thy hand is cold and icy ; un-&#xD;
like the hand which, in days long gone, I&#xD;
used to hold in mine without a sigh or mur-&#xD;
mur from thy lips: it is cold iow,as thy be-&#xD;
trayer's soon shall be. I did thee a foul and&#xD;
heartless wrong, for which, on the threshold&#xD;
of Eternity, I implore thy pardon and the for-&#xD;
giveness of thy kindred. The priest is at&#xD;
hand to seal my repentance-let him ap-&#xD;
proach, that my last act on earth may not&#xD;
add to the remorse which now burns within&#xD;
this heart.'   .&#xD;
The ceremony commenced, went on, wa&#xD;
finished.&#xD;
Again, St. Mark's bell rang a warning note.&#xD;
'The prisoners are summoned to the block,&#xD;
said the voice at the door.&#xD;
' Let this my first, my last honest kiss,,&#xD;
Eugenim,' said the roue, in a brusque tone,&#xD;
' be the pledge of my repentance.' Then&#xD;
rushing to his father, he knelt; and, seizing&#xD;
the old man's listless hand, exclaimed-' Fa-&#xD;
ther I father ! now forgive and bless me!'&#xD;
The lips of the doge moved, but naught&#xD;
save a whispering sound was heard.&#xD;
'Father! father! for God's sake! speak&#xD;
to me ' repeated the roue in agony.&#xD;
His father's eves were raised heavenward&#xD;
-his lips were moving, as if in prayer.&#xD;
The bell pealed again.&#xD;
'The hour for death is struck,' said the&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
The roue started up-embraced his uncon-&#xD;
scious sire-then waving a farewoll to his&#xD;
new made bride, sprang into the procession&#xD;
of judges, as guarded on either side. by the&#xD;
black knights, they slowly left the hall.&#xD;
The doge, the priest, the orange girl and&#xD;
one in the garb of a gondolier alone remain-&#xD;
ed. The lips and eyes of the doge still&#xD;
heavenward turned ; the priest and gondolier&#xD;
supporting0the statue-like form of the veiled&#xD;
bride.&#xD;
The bell struck again; a sound, as of an&#xD;
axe falling on a block, grated on their ears.&#xD;
A long loud shriek rang through the hall-&#xD;
the orange girl fell back.&#xD;

636                   THE ORANGE GI&#xD;
Shouts swelled in the Square, as the last&#xD;
stroke of the executioner's axe fell on the&#xD;
block, and cries, wild and solemn-and shrill&#xD;
and enthusiastic, split the air-' The tyrants&#xD;
are slain-Venice is free!'&#xD;
Wii that loud shout, the lips of the doge&#xD;
ceased to move-his eyes grew glassy-his&#xD;
limbs tottered, and his spirit was travelling&#xD;
with that of his son to the Soul's High Court.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
THE DAWN OF -FR.EEDOM.&#xD;
The news of the execution flew from&#xD;
mouth to mouth, like wildfire ; the people&#xD;
looked in each others' eyes half paralysed ;&#xD;
even those who had been in the conspiracy&#xD;
couid sca-rce believe their glorious work was&#xD;
fully accomplished, till they beheld the de-&#xD;
capitated trunks of those who had composed&#xD;
the Tribunal. The Carnival ceased only to&#xD;
break forth anew, with wilder mirth. Peo-&#xD;
ple laughed, danced, shouted, yea, and wept&#xD;
for gladness' sake. Groups met, chatted a&#xD;
moment over the affair, then separated, in&#xD;
wild joy, and, collecting again together, re-&#xD;
hearsed their former converse. So wild was&#xD;
the enthusiasm,' that old men, forgetting&#xD;
their age, frolicked, 'danced, gambolled,&#xD;
shouted and made merry, like youths; misers&#xD;
forgot their avarice, and, joining in the gen-&#xD;
eral gladsomeness, squandered the savings&#xD;
of years; processions formed in every part&#xD;
of the city, and, preceded by music, strode&#xD;
through Venice in triumph. The sick and&#xD;
the feeble, the halt and the blind were help-&#xD;
ed to the windows that they might either&#xD;
see the cavalcade or hear the enthusiastic&#xD;
strains which announced their country's free-&#xD;
dom from  the thrall of the Long-Dreaded.&#xD;
The timid forgot their timidity, arid, as they&#xD;
strode in the processions, felt brave as the&#xD;
bravest; the niggard forgot his narrow-heart-&#xD;
edness, and when the upraised hand of the&#xD;
beggar mtet his regenerated eye, gave of his&#xD;
means freely ; men who had long been foes,&#xD;
met, and, in the patriotism of their hearts,&#xD;
looked kindly on each other, and embraced ;&#xD;
jealousies were discarded by rival trades-&#xD;
men, and free and generous hands and sym-&#xD;
pathies exchanged, and lasting friendships&#xD;
formed where all before was hatred. It was&#xD;
a time of universal joy, and brought back to&#xD;
the mental eye of the moralist, those happy&#xD;
days and scenes when men's faces were the&#xD;
outward pictures of their hearts.&#xD;
Still there was a sadness, too, in Venice-&#xD;
the corse of the just doge,-Foscari,.-lay in&#xD;
state, in the ducal palace. Waxen tapers&#xD;
gleamed around the bier, and monks and&#xD;
priests, and the dignitaries of the State sat&#xD;
In little groups, thinking of the dead. Alone&#xD;
in his palace, with no son nor wife nor&#xD;
daughter to weep o'er his pale and deathly&#xD;
&#xD;
IRL OF VENICE..&#xD;
&#xD;
brow, lay Jacopo the Just. None wept for&#xD;
him-none told his virtues, his secret deeds&#xD;
of charity, or his worth. Men of place and&#xD;
mamnon were around him, gazing on his&#xD;
shroud, and thinking-of their future in re-&#xD;
gard to place and mammon. They knew&#xD;
their country was freed from a yoke which&#xD;
had, in its time, bowed all their'necks to i'&#xD;
will ; but they participated not in the gene&#xD;
ral Joy, because the doge's death and the&#xD;
Tribunal's overthrow might be the harbin-&#xD;
gers only to their loss of office. And, in&#xD;
this train of thought around the bier of&#xD;
Death, they pondered o'er the means of coin-&#xD;
ing gold and place, ' Who next' shall be&#xD;
doge V'* Who be the electors?' 'Shall my'&#xD;
office and its emoluments be wrested from&#xD;
me ?, Or shall I become a favorite with&#xD;
the elected one V' Such were a few of the&#xD;
thousand interrogatories each of the sitters&#xD;
put to himself, while paying one of the last&#xD;
duties of man to his fellow man in that hall&#xD;
where Death rejoiced o'er one victim.&#xD;
But there were many on that day whose&#xD;
minds were sorely rent while reflecting on&#xD;
the state of things which had been brought&#xD;
about by the conspirators. The doge was&#xD;
dead-this was not expected, andno provi-&#xD;
sion had been made for such emergency.&#xD;
A party of twenty men were assembled&#xD;
in St. Mark's vault. Their ages varied from&#xD;
thirty to fifty years. They were of different&#xD;
castes in rank, and each was garbed as be-&#xD;
fitted his rank and calling. They were sit-&#xD;
ting, in solemn conclave, upon the rostrum&#xD;
and around the altar on which they had be--&#xD;
fore sworn to immolate the tyrannical rulers&#xD;
of their country. They were the officers&#xD;
of the sworn Brotherhood. They had been,&#xD;
in council since day-break, and had not bro-&#xD;
ken bread nor tasted drink, nor closed their&#xD;
eyes in slumber since the hour of their en-&#xD;
trance into the dungeons of the late Tribunal.&#xD;
It was now verging on to noon, and they&#xD;
had not yet decided on the object of their&#xD;
meeting.&#xD;
When their council had broken up, a glow&#xD;
of earnest satisfaction was visible in every&#xD;
eye and on every cheek ; and'on the day&#xD;
succeeding the burial of the late doge, the&#xD;
anxieties and cares of those who had held&#xD;
office under him, were set at rest forever:&#xD;
and-they murmured!&#xD;
CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
TU E B RIDAL IORtN.&#xD;
Pass we now three months.&#xD;
It was ab6ut the hour of nine, on a lovely&#xD;
morning in June, that a young man, in the&#xD;
garb of a secretary, knocked tyriskly at the&#xD;
door of an humble and retired-looking dwell-&#xD;
ing in the Raoni square. Fe wore a small&#xD;
moustache, appointed beard and jetty ringlets&#xD;
&#xD;
l&#xD;
&#xD;
0"&#xD;
&#xD;
4A&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ORANGE GIR&#xD;
hung ove1 nis shoulders. A slender rapier ti&#xD;
hung at his side, and a short dagger dangled  ti&#xD;
from his girdle. He was handsome as the a&#xD;
term goes, and-we are afraid to believe-  a&#xD;
knew it. There was a no small share of s&#xD;
importance in his step, and carriage ; but k&#xD;
then he was young. He entered, sans cerc- e&#xD;
monie, and was met in the half by ayoung  s&#xD;
lady, whom we have already introduced to t&#xD;
the reader.                               N&#xD;
You are one to keep a promise!' said the  C&#xD;
young lady tossing her head, indignantly.  y&#xD;
'Nay, f could not come earlier,' replied  a&#xD;
the secretary: ' but we'shall lose nothir.g  s&#xD;
by this trifling delay: for I have the doge's t&#xD;
permission to take thee to the palace, that t&#xD;
we may enter St. Mark's with the bridal s&#xD;
cortege. So get thee ready soon as may   b&#xD;
be.' t&#xD;
There was a mischievous light   tIhe eyes c&#xD;
of the secretary during this brief s eech.  s&#xD;
They entered the sitting room.        t&#xD;
'Ho! ho!' said the secretary, as his eye1s v&#xD;
fell on some bright and gauzy garments&#xD;
which were lying on a cushion in one cor-&#xD;
ner. ' I&#xD;
The maiden met his glance and blushed.I&#xD;
She did not speak a sylla':e, but blushed&#xD;
to the temples. A great deal of meaning is I&#xD;
often convoyed in a blush.&#xD;
'Nay, thou shaltN wear it, my beloved's&#xD;
said the secretary, taking her hand and  t&#xD;
drawing her fondly to his breast, and im-r&#xD;
printing a lover's seal upon her lips. 'So, t&#xD;
ike a fair arid bewitching damsel, don itt&#xD;
with all speed.''&#xD;
Did she need a second bidding      e&#xD;
Ten minutes afterward, they left the-&#xD;
house, and bent their steps in the direction&#xD;
of the palace.                         '&#xD;
St. Maik's temple was crowded with the&#xD;
wives and daughters and scions of all castes&#xD;
in Venice. .From the palace to the church&#xD;
was but a short distance ; but that shortI&#xD;
distance was amply taken advantage of by&#xD;
the populace, and a crowd was collectedI&#xD;
from either side of the palace portals, to&#xD;
either side of the portals of the church, leav-&#xD;
ing a broad and winding passage for the&#xD;
noble cortege.&#xD;
The bell of St. Mark's pealed forth men&#xD;
rily, and its notes seeineI to spread jc-yOus-&#xD;
ness over the hearts and faces of the niulti-&#xD;
tude. The bridal bells, the bridal bells, how&#xD;
merrily they sang !&#xD;
The palace portals were opened wide, and&#xD;
the gaping throng shouted as if their lungs&#xD;
would rack, as the bridal procession ap-&#xD;
peared.      ,&#xD;
'Make way-make way!' shouted the&#xD;
guards who had oeen posted to keep clegr&#xD;
the passage to the temple. The throng fell&#xD;
.a:k, but riot unwillingly: for there was&#xD;
no: one in that mighty throng, but would&#xD;
have died, if necessary, in defeice of the&#xD;
well beloved doge.     '&#xD;

The broad isle was cleared for tIe bride-&#xD;

bridegroorm met, as if by accident'-but it&#xD;
was not by acciderit-and then they strode&#xD;
Solemnly-(people put on such solerimir airs!)&#xD;
to a royal seat, prepar(e(t for themti, on the&#xD;
right hand of tie marble altar.. The secre-&#xD;
tary and his beloved were not fir off ; and&#xD;
the parents and cousins of JuRnetta, by a&#xD;
strange coincidence, were not far off from&#xD;
t.reir daughter. Every brody looked grave,&#xD;
and almost every one blusned ,although&#xD;
there was but little need of eit ber. These&#xD;
thing s will happen -despite of their inpro-&#xD;
priety&#xD;
The bell ceased pealing, and, ere the ca-&#xD;
dence of its last note hard died away, the&#xD;
bride and bridegroom were summoned by&#xD;
the priest, aid the doge, Galhanro, anrd his&#xD;
beloved Isabel were united forever. The&#xD;
ring was placed upon tie linger of the bride,&#xD;
and then St. Mark's temple re-eccoed to the&#xD;

CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
CONcLUbAoN.&#xD;
On a low cushioned couch, in a chamber&#xD;
where Ce luxuries of 'he higher caste con-&#xD;
trasted - troungly with the simple garniture&#xD;
of the lowly, refined the fragile fo'rm of the&#xD;
fair but sutTering Eugenie. The apartment&#xD;
had but one window, and that was adorned&#xD;
with a curiai. of crimson gauze. It was&#xD;
mid-day ; and the sun-rays gleaning through&#xD;
the curtain, east a glowing tint upiton the&#xD;
couch on wiich the orange girl reclined.&#xD;
Her head was leaning upon her upraised&#xD;
hand, and her dark eyes- gazing vacantly&#xD;
upon the antics of a little biud Which was&#xD;
hopping from cross-twig to cross-twig of ts&#xD;
wiry cage, and singing merrily, as if to im-&#xD;
part a corresponding mirthfulness ,in the&#xD;
heart of its fair mistress. An eastern carpet&#xD;
covered the floor ; paintings, amorous and&#xD;
religious, adorned the yellow colored walls;&#xD;
and, like tbose of the wealthier classes of the&#xD;
day, the ceiling was hid by silkea sheets, so&#xD;
disposed as to represent the ceiling of a&#xD;
Venetian boudoir. A small circular table&#xD;
stood beside the couch, whose surface was&#xD;
covered with low, square bottles of rich&#xD;
wines and inspiriting waters, for the re-in-&#xD;
vigorating of the feeble frame of the invalid.&#xD;
But thesee were untouched,while an earthen&#xD;
iar of water beside them was more than&#xD;
half emptied. The costume of the orange.&#xD;
girl was composed of a simple tight-fitting&#xD;
frock of green velvet ; a pointed collar of&#xD;
worked lace, and a string of pearls around&#xD;
her waist. A small golden cross, hung from&#xD;
her neck by a blue ribbon, and lay on her&#xD;
breast ; a bracelet of hair, mounted with&#xD;
. gold, encircled her left wrist, and a plain&#xD;
ring adorned her forefinger. 1Her hair was&#xD;
in clusters and fell in profusion over her&#xD;
alabaster neck. I'r feet, scarcely percep-&#xD;
tible, were encased in slippers ef green mo-&#xD;
rocco, and adorned with small square silver.&#xD;
buckles. In fine, tne apartment resembled&#xD;
more the boudoir of some gay and coquett-&#xD;
ish belle than that of a poor, deluded girl ;&#xD;
and the fair occuptant herself som.3 spoiled,&#xD;
effeminate child of titled parents, than the'&#xD;
daughter of a poor and obscure fruit vender.&#xD;
But these things aside.&#xD;
A low knock at thto door broke the re-&#xD;
flective train of the orange girl's thought.&#xD;
'Come in,' was the response, in a low,&#xD;
soft voice.&#xD;
The door opened. and a lady of imperial&#xD;
dress and beauty entered the chAmber.&#xD;
'How art thou love?' said the latter in a&#xD;
tone of.affeeticnate anxiety.&#xD;
'Better, much better,' replied the orange&#xD;
girl, faitl y s.  a ffev days more, and-I shall&#xD;
cease to trouble earth.'&#xD;
&#xD;
'Nay, Eugenie,' rejoined her companion,&#xD;
playfulny, ' we'll have no such melancholy&#xD;
sentiment as that born in our palace house-&#xD;
hold.- We brought thee here to make thee&#xD;
happy and life-loving, and we shall not suf-&#xD;
fer thee to harbor any thought traitorous to&#xD;
our intentions or to happiness. Life was&#xD;
given us to enjoy, not to cause us misery ;,&#xD;
and it is impiety to be wretched, when we&#xD;
can be happy. Thou must live for thine&#xD;
own sake, for our's, and for love's.'&#xD;
'Love's ? Ah, your highness!'&#xD;
Hightess! Hey day! Mine nwn l6ved&#xD;
friend and companion growing cold and dis-&#xD;
tant ! ' Highness' me not, Eugenie; I am&#xD;
no ' highness' to thee. To thee now, as&#xD;
ever, I am plain Isabel. 11 ve thee ith a&#xD;
sister's love, and thou, loving me the same,&#xD;
must call me, as heretofore, 'dear Isabel.'&#xD;
Because bride to the doge am I to lose the&#xD;
affectionate greetings of my friends? Marry,&#xD;
not I! Friendship and love are too rare to&#xD;
be sacrificed so cheaply. Call ie Isabel,&#xD;
dear Isabel, or never word speak to me&#xD;
again.'&#xD;
' Dear Isabel!'&#xD;
'There's a-dear girl,' said the other, kissing&#xD;
her, and twinig her arms around tle orange&#xD;
girl's neck, 'thus thou shalt call me ever.&#xD;
As for title, art thou not the greater 'high-&#xD;
ness' of the two ?  Did not the patriots in&#xD;
token of thy wrongs, use thy well known&#xD;
nickname as their signa, cry, their watch-&#xD;
word, to inspire each other with confidence&#xD;
and courage in their brave enterprise ? By&#xD;
my troth! I shall henceforth' Ihighness' thee,&#xD;
ip revenge ; if thou darest title me again.&#xD;
But I've a word for thee. Now don't blush&#xD;
but boldly guess what it is!'&#xD;
'Nay, I cannot guess.'&#xD;
'Cannot guess-py sister, Eugenie, c.i&#xD;
not guess ! Oh, horrid ! Th'u a woman,&#xD;
and cannot guess ? Shocking! I shall hence.&#xD;
ffrth deem-thee other than thou art, if'thou&#xD;
canst not guess ! Look in mine eves!'&#xD;
'I see nothing in them  but love, dear&#xD;
Isabel!'&#xD;
'Nothing but love! Of course not ! Gal-&#xD;
liano always says the same ; and kisses my&#xD;
lips as a punishment for every such asser-&#xD;
tion. Nothing but love! Marry ! I want&#xD;
thec to see nothing else in them ! But there&#xD;
are other eyes could look even more fondly&#xD;
on thee than mine; and my dear sister must&#xD;
let them do so. Come, promise me that&#xD;
they shall have such permission!'&#xD;
' Dear Isabel-'&#xD;
' Nay, nay, no treachery, my pretty little&#xD;
captiie. Like a grim arid hideous bear, I'll&#xD;
hug thee into consenting. Dost thou refuseI&#xD;
Nay, tthen, thus I keep my word!' And she&#xD;
clasped the orange girl affectionately, to her&#xD;
breast.&#xD;
Eugenie wept.&#xD;

Agnes had'not power to interrupt him, amnd lie fa&#xD;
Went on.                                    .r&#xD;
"This house was built by subscription; and it si&#xD;
was begun by a kind gentleman of the name of th&#xD;
Fitzhenry, who afterwards, poor soul, being made lo&#xD;
low in the world-by losses in trade, and by having l&#xD;
his brain turned by a good-for nothing daughter, e&#xD;
was one of the first patients in it himself." s&#xD;
Here Agnes, to whom this recollection had but g&#xD;
too forcibly occurred already, groaned aloud.  it&#xD;
"What ; tired so soon ?" said her companion. sI&#xD;
I doubt you have not been used to stir about-&#xD;
you have been too tenderly brought up. Ahl!&#xD;
tender parents often spoil children, and they never n&#xD;
thank them  for it when they grow up neither, tl&#xD;
and often come to no good besides."&#xD;
Agnes was going to make some observations d&#xD;
wrung from her by the poignancy of self-upbraid- y&#xD;
ing, when she ieard a loud cry as of one in ago- w&#xD;
ny; fancying it her father's voice, she started up, ]A&#xD;
and stopping her ears, ran towards the town so n&#xD;
fast that it was with difficulty the cottager could g&#xD;
overtake her.                                o&#xD;
When'ie did so,he was surprised at the agita-&#xD;
tion of her manner.   "What, I suppose you eI&#xD;
thought they were comig after you " said lie. k&#xD;
"But there was no danger ; I dare say it was on-&#xD;
ly an unruly one whom they were beating."&#xD;
Agnes, on hearing this, absolutely screamed&#xD;
with agony ;land seizing the cottager's arm, "Let f&#xD;
us hasten to the town," said she, in a hollow and&#xD;
broken voice, " while I have strength enough left&#xD;
to carry tme thither&#xD;
At length they entered its walls, ard the cotta-&#xD;
ger said, " Here we are at last. A welcome home&#xD;
to you, young voman."        ,t&#xD;
"Welcome I and home to me !" cried Agnes,&#xD;
wildly, "I have no home now-I can expect no&#xD;
welcome! Once indeed-"&#xD;
Here, overcome with recollections almost too&#xD;
painful to be endured, she turned from him and&#xD;
sobbed aloud, while the kind-hearted man could&#xD;
scarcely forbear shedding tears at sight of such&#xD;
mysterious, yetevidently real, distress.&#xD;
In happier days, when Agnes used to leave&#xD;
home on visits to her distant fiends, anticipation&#xD;
of the welcome she should receive on her return&#xD;
was, perhaps, the greatest pleasure that she en-&#xD;
joyed during her absence. As the adventurer to&#xD;
India, while toiling for wealth, never loses sight&#xD;
of the hope that lie shall spend his fortune in his&#xD;
native land,-so Agnes, whatever company shef&#xD;
saw, whatever amusements she partook of, looked&#xD;
eagerly forward to the iour when she should give&#xD;
her expecting father and her affectionate compan-&#xD;
ions a recital of all that she had heard and seen.&#xD;
For, though sie had been absent a few weeks only,&#xD;
"her presence made a little holiday," and she was&#xD;
received by her father with delight too deep to&#xD;
be expressed ; while, even earlier than decorum&#xD;
warranted, her friends were thronging to her door&#xD;
to welcome hIome the heightener of their plea-&#xD;
sures, and the gentle soother of their sorrows (for&#xD;
Agnes "loved and felt for all;" she had a smile&#xD;
ready to greet the child of prosperity, and a tear&#xD;
for the son of adversity.)&#xD;
As she was thus honored, thus beloved, no won-&#xD;
der the thoughts of home, and of returning home,&#xD;
were wont to suffuse the eyes of Agnes with tears&#xD;
of exquisite pleasure ; and that, when her native&#xD;
town appeared in view, a group of expecting. and&#xD;
joyful faces used to swim before her sight, while,&#xD;
hastening forward to have the first glance of her,&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
mcy used to picture her father I- Now, dread&#xD;
reverse ! after a long absence, an absence of years,&#xD;
me was returning to tht same place, inliabited by&#xD;
te same friends; but the voices that 'used to be&#xD;
oud in pronouncing her welcome, were now to be&#xD;
oud inl proclaiming indignation at lier sight ; the&#xD;
yes that used to beam with gladness at her pre-&#xD;
ence, would now be turned front hier with dis-&#xD;
ust; and the fond father, who used to be count-&#xD;
ig the moments till shoi arrived, was now-I&#xD;
mall not go on-suffice, that Agnes felt, to her&#xD;
heart's core,' all the bitterness of the contrast.&#xD;
When they arrived near the place of lier desbi-&#xD;
ation, Agnes stopped, and told the cottager that&#xD;
hey must part.&#xD;
" So much the worse," said the good man. " I&#xD;
o not know how it is, but you are so sorrowful&#xD;
et so kind and gentle, somehow, that both my&#xD;
ife and I have taken a likinrT. you. You must&#xD;
ot be angrybut we cannot 'p thkikdng you are&#xD;
not one of us, but a lady, though you ame so dis-&#xD;
uised and so humble ; but misfortune spares no&#xD;
ne you know."&#xD;
Agnes, affected and gratified by these artless&#xD;
xpressions of good will, replied, "~I have, indeed,&#xD;
nown better days."&#xD;
" And will again, I hope with all my heart and&#xD;
oul," interrupted the cottager with great warmth.&#xD;
"I fear not," replied Agnes, "/my dear worthy&#xD;
riend."&#xD;
Nay, young lady," rejoined lie, "my wife and&#xD;
are proper to be your servants, not friends."&#xD;
"You are my friends, perhaps my only friends,"&#xD;
returned Agnes, mournfully. " Perhaps there is&#xD;
oet, at this moment, another hand in the universe,&#xD;
hat would not reject mine, or another tongue that&#xD;
would not upbraid me."&#xD;
" They must be hiard-iearted wretched , indeed,&#xD;
who would upbraid a poor woman for ier nisfor-&#xD;
unes," cried the cottager; "however you shall&#xD;
never want a friend while I live. You know I&#xD;
aved your life ; and, somehow, I feel therefore un&#xD;
f you belonged to me. I once saved one of- my&#xD;
pigeons from a hawk, and I believe, were I star- -&#xD;
ving, I could not now bear to kill the little crea-&#xD;
ture -, it would seem like eating my own flesh and&#xD;
blood-so I am sure.I could never desert you,"&#xD;
"You have not yet heard my story," replied&#xD;
Agnes - " but you shall know who I aim soon ;&#xD;
and then, if you feel still disposed to offer me your&#xD;
friendship, I shall be grateful to accept it."&#xD;
The house to which Agnes was hastening wait&#xD;
that of her nurse, from whom sie had always ex-&#xD;
perienced the affection of a mother, aund] hoped&#xD;
now to receive a temporary asylum; but she&#xD;
might not be living-and, with a beating heart,&#xD;
Agnes knocked at the door. It was opened by&#xD;
Fanny, ier nurse's daughter, the playfellow of&#xD;
Agnes's childhood.&#xD;
" Thank Heaven ?" said Agnmes, as she astened&#xD;
back to the cottager," I hope I have, at least, one&#xD;
fiend left;" and telling him lie might go home&#xD;
again, as she was almost certain of shelter for the&#xD;
mght, the poor man shook her hMartily by the&#xD;
hand, prayed to God to bless her,. and departed.&#xD;
Agnes then returned to Fanny, who was still&#xD;
standing by the door, wondering who had knocked&#xD;
at so late an hout and displeased at being kept&#xD;
so long in the cold.&#xD;
" Will you admit me, Fanny, and give me shel-&#xD;
ter for the night 1" said Agnes, in a faint and&#xD;
broken voice.&#xD;

convinced her that sie was still dear to one pureI&#xD;
and atectionate heart.&#xD;
During this time little Edward remained covered&#xD;
up so closely that Fanny did not know what the&#xD;
bundle was that Agnes held in her lap ; but- when&#xD;
she lifted up the cloak that concealed him, Fann y&#xD;
was in an instant kneeling by his side, and gazig&#xD;
on hin with admiration. " Is it-is it-" said&#xD;
Fanny, With hiesitation.&#xD;
" It is my child," replied Agnes, sighing; and&#xD;
Fanny lavished on the unconscious boy lie caresses&#xD;
which respect forbade her to bestow on the mother.i&#xD;
"Famity," said Agnes, "you say nothing of your &#xD;

"Have you any children I"&#xD;
"None."&#xD;
"Then  ill you promise me, if I die, to be av&#xD;

Faity seized her hand, and, in a voice half-&#xD;
choked by sobs, said, "I promise vou.*&#xD;

arms to her humble friend; Fanny's respect yielded&#xD;
to affection, and falling on Agnes' neck, sie sobbed&#xD;
aloud.a&#xD;
"My dear Fanny !" said Agnes, "Ihave a question g&#xD;
to ask. and I charge you to answer it truly."  ti&#xD;
"Do not - ask mae, do not ask me, for indeed I w&#xD;
dare not answer you," replied Fanny, in great agi-&#xD;
tatin.                                      a&#xD;
Agnes guessed thte cause, and hastened to tell her g&#xD;
that the question was not concerning her father, as 'W&#xD;
she was well acquainted within lis situation already,&#xD;
and proceeded to ask whether her elopememt and&#xD;
ill conduct had at all hastened the  earth of her se&#xD;
nurse, who was in ill health when she went away. si&#xD;
"Oh no," replied Fanny, "she never believed&#xD;
that you could be gone off willingly, but was'sure h&#xD;
you were spirited away;; and shi6 died expecting d&#xD;

Agnes was too honorable to take to herself the&#xD;

owned that she was indeed guilty; "  or should I,"&#xD;
she adted, "have tared to intrude my elf on you,&#xD;

oiuced so low it time world, nor the sudden bursts&#xD;
of joy to which ilie gave vent the next moment,&#xD;
when she reflected that Agne-s was returned, never&#xD;
perhaps to leave her again.&#xD;
Agnes wore away gmeat part of thm night in&#xD;
teiii gFaum yher mour-ful tale, and iml hearing&#xD;
from her a full account of her father's sufferings,&#xD;
bankruptcy, aind consequent madness. At day-&#xD;

nate on the romantic, yet in her eves feasible, plan,&#xD;
which she had formed for the fture ; while Fanny,&#xD;
wearied out by the violent emotions which she had&#xD;
undergone, sobbed herself to sleep by her side.&#xD;
The next morning Agnes did not rise till Fanny&#xD;
had been up some time; and when she seated her-&#xD;
self at the breakfast-table, ste was surprised to see&#xD;
t spread im a manner which ill-accorded with her&#xD;
or Fanity's situation. On asking the reason, Fanny&#xD;
owned she could not bear that her dear young lady&#xD;
-hould fare only as sie did, and had, therefore, pro.&#xD;
vided a suitable breakfast for her.&#xD;
"But you forget," said Agnes, " that if I remain&#xD;
with you, neither you nor I can.afford such break-&#xD;
asts as these."&#xD;
"True," replied Fanny, amourifully; "then you&#xD;
must consider this as a welcome, unadam."&#xD;
"Ay," rejoined Agnes," the prodigal has return-&#xD;
d, and you have killed the fatted calf."&#xD;
Fanmy burst into tears; while Agnes, shocked&#xD;
t htavimng excited them- by time htin us hmici she un-&#xD;
'uardedly gave to her poor friend's attention, tried&#xD;
o oothe her into composure, amid affected a gaiety&#xD;

Sd for her intellects, till she explained her plans&#xD;
and her hopes ; uhich Fanny, though she could&#xD;
not share in them, was too humane to discourage.&#xD;
"But now," continued Agnes, " let us consult on&#xD;
my future means of gaining a livelihood ;" and&#xD;
finding that Fanny, besides keeping a day-school,&#xD;
took in shawl work, a considerable shawl manu-&#xD;
facture being carried on in the town, it was settled&#xD;
that she should procure the same employment for&#xD;
Agnes, and that a small back room in Fanny's&#xD;
little dwelling should be fitted up for ler.&#xD;
In the mneIiwhie, the governors of the asylum&#xD;
had returned to their respective habitations, with&#xD;
feeliiugs towards Agnes very different to those&#xD;
with which they had assembled. But too pru-&#xD;
dent to make even a penitent sinner the subject&#xD;
of praise in their own families, they gave short,&#xD;
evasive answers to the inquiries that were made&#xD;
there.                                     .&#xD;
Mr. Seyrnour, on the contrary, thought it his&#xD;
duty to relieve the generous and affectionate heart&#xD;
of his daughter, by a minute detail of what had&#xD;
passed at the meeting; but lie had no opportunity&#xD;
of doimig this when he first returned home,-as lie&#xD;
found there a large party assembled to dinner.&#xD;
Caroline, however, watched his countenance and&#xD;
manner, and seeing on the first an expression of&#xD;
highly awakened feeling, and ii the latter a de-&#xD;
gree of absence and aversion to talking, which lie&#xD;
always di-played whenever his heart had beei&#xD;
deeply interested, she flattered herself that Agnes&#xD;
was the cacuie of these appearances, and hoped to&#xD;
hear of om1,1etlJHring favorable.&#xD;
During dinner, a lady asked Caroline which of&#xD;
her young friends would accompany her to church&#xD;
in the capacity of bridemaid. Carohine started,&#xD;
and turned pale at the question-for melancholy&#xD;
were the reflections which it excited in her mind.&#xD;
It had always been an agreement between her and&#xD;
Agnes, that whichever of the two were married&#xD;
first, should have the other for her bridemaid, and&#xD;
the question was repeated before Caroline could&#xD;
trust her vice to answer it. " I shall have no&#xD;
bridemnaids but miy sisters," she replied, at length,'&#xD;
with a qivermig hip; "I cannot-imdeed, I wish&#xD;
to have no other now."   Then, looking at her&#xD;
father, she saw that his eyes were filled with&#xD;
tears; and unable to suppress, but wishing to con-&#xD;
ceal, hI motion, hie abruptly left the room..&#xD;
'u'lere i scaretly any human beimg whose heart&#xD;
has not taught him that we are never so compas-&#xD;
sionate nd benevolent towards others, as when&#xD;
our ownv wi hes are completely gratified-we are&#xD;
never so humble as then. This was the case with&#xD;
Mr. Seyniour. He was about to maiur-y 1lis eldest&#xD;
daughter i a m manner even superiorl to hits warm-&#xD;
est expectations, ani his paternal care, therefore,&#xD;
was amply rewarded. But his heart told him that&#xD;
is care and hi affection had not exceeded, per-&#xD;
haps not equalled, that of Fitzhenry ; nor had the&#xD;
prone of hisdaughter's youth, fair as it was,&#xD;
ever equalled that of the unihappy Agnes ; yet&#xD;
Caroline was going to aggrandise her family, and&#xD;
Agnes hlad disgraced hers. She was happy-Ag-&#xD;
nes mise able. He was the possessor of a large&#xD;
fortune, and all the comforts of life-Fitzenry&#xD;
was in a madhouse.&#xD;
This contrast between their situations was for-&#xD;
cibly recalled to his mind by the question ad-&#xD;
dressed to Caroline; and already softened by the&#xD;
iterviesw of the morning, he could not support his&#xD;
feelings, but was obliged toIasten to his chamber&#xD;
&#xD;
to vent im tears and thanksgivings the mingle aewn&#xD;
nations of humility and gratitude. Caroline sWon&#xD;
followed him, and heard with eniotions as violent,&#xD;
her futhier's description of Agnes' narration, an+i&#xD;
her conduct before the governors. "But it is i.'&#xD;
sufficient," said she, "that you tell me this; yo&#xD;
must tell it wherever you hear the poor penitent,&#xD;
name mentioned, and avow the change which id&#xD;
has made in your' sentiments towards her; you&#xD;
must be her advocate."&#xD;
Her advocate I What would the world say '"&#xD;
"Just what you wish it to say. Believe mie, my&#xD;
dear father, the world is in many instances like a&#xD;
spoilt child, who treats with contempt the foolish&#xD;
parent that indulges his caprices, but behaves with&#xD;
respect to those who, regardless of his clamors,&#xD;
give the law to him, instead of receiving it.&#xD;
You speak from the untaught enthusiasm and&#xD;
confidence of youth, Caroline ; but experience&#xD;
will teach you that no one can with iIpunity run&#xD;
counter to the opinions of the woldd"&#xD;
" My experience has taught mae that already&#xD;
but, in this case, you do not seen? to dto the world&#xD;
justice. The world would blame you, and justly&#xD;
too, if, while talking of the unhappy Agmues, you&#xD;
should make light of her guilt; iut why not, while&#xD;
you acknowledge that to be enormiouis, descant&#xD;
with equal justice on the deep sense of it which&#xD;
she entertains, and on the excellence of her pres-&#xD;
ent intentions I To this, what can( the world say,&#xD;
but that you are a just judge I And even sup-&#xD;
pose they should think you too-lenient a one, will&#xD;
not the approbation of your own conscience be an&#xD;

my dear father I were you not one of the best and&#xD;
most unspoila6le of men, your anxious attention to&#xD;
what the world will say of your actiotis. must long&#xD;
ere this have made you one of the worst."&#xD;
" Enough, enough," cried Mr. Seymour, wounded&#xD;
self-love contending -in his bosonm with parental&#xD;
pride, for he had some suspicion that Caroline was&#xD;
right ; 1"what would the world say if it were to&#xD;
hear you schooling your father I"&#xD;
" When the world"iears me trying to exalt my&#xD;
own wisdom by doubting my father's, I hope it&#xD;
will treat me with the severity which I shall&#xD;
deserve."I&#xD;
Mr. Seymour clasped her to huis bosom as&#xD;
she said this, and involuntarily exclaimed, "Oh,&#xD;
poor Fitzhenry I"&#xD;
"And poor Agnes too'!" added Caroline, throw-&#xD;
ing lier arms round his neck ; "it Oill be my part-&#xD;
ing request, when I leave my paternal rof, that&#xD;
you will do all the justice you can to my once&#xD;
honored friend, and let the world say what it&#xD;
pleases."&#xD;
"Well, well, I will indulge you by granting your&#xD;
request," said Mr. Seymour, "or, rather, I will in-&#xD;
dulge myself."&#xD;
Thieni, satisfied with each other, they returned to'&#xD;
the company.&#xD;
A few days after this conversation Caroline's&#xD;
marriage took place, and was celebrated by tie&#xD;
ringing of bells and other rejoicing.&#xD;
What are the bells ringing for to-day I"&#xD;
said Agnes to Fanny, as she was eating her breae-&#xD;
fast with more appetite than usual.&#xD;

Mr. Seymour wats drinking tea in. a large party,&#xD;
when a lady, to whose plain, awkward, uninterest-&#xD;

engaging Agnes had formerly been a powerful&#xD;

a volte m- Ipened by passion, which at all times&#xD;
resenibled the -s-creamt of a pea lien,-she exclaimed,&#xD;

would do well to follow."      -    w&#xD;
" She set me an example !" vociferated Mrs. Mac-&#xD;

But 'tis as I said-some people may do anything-&#xD;
for, wicked as she is, Miss 14tzhenry is still cried&#xD;
up as something extraordinary, and is even held up&#xD;
as an example to modest women''i&#xD;
So saying,- she arose;.but Mr. Seymour rose,&#xD;
also, and said, " There is no necessity for leaving&#xD;
the company, madam, as $ will leave it ; for I am&#xD;
tired of hearing myself so grossly misrepresented.&#xD;

one day appeal ft-ero them to a merciful and long-&#xD;
suffering Judge."&#xD;
Then, bowing respectfully to all but Mrs. Maq-&#xD;
fiendy, lie withdrew, and gav  lier an o opportunity&#xD;
of remarking that Mr. Seymour was mighty warm&#xD;
in the creature's defence. She -did not know that&#xD;
he was so interested about her; but sIe always&#xD;
thought hin a gay man, atd hie supposed Miss&#xD;
Fitzherry, as lie called her, woud be glad to taka&#xD;
up with, anything now.&#xD;
This speech, sorry ami I to say, was received&#xD;
with a general and complaisant smile, though it was&#xD;
reckoned unjust; for there are few who have virtue&#xD;
and resolution enough to stand forward for an ab-&#xD;
sent and calumniated individual, if there be any-&#xD;
thing ludicrous in the tale against lim; and the&#xD;
precise, careful, elderly Mr. Sieynmour, who was&#xD;
always shrinking from censure like asesitive plant&#xD;
from the touch, accused by implication of being&#xD;
the private friend of the youthful Agnes, excited&#xD;
a degree of merry malice in the company not un.&#xD;
pleasant to their feelings.&#xD;
But, in spite of the effortsof calurmny, the account&#xD;
Mr. Seymour had given of Agnes amd her peni-&#xD;

by the other governors, every one, except time fero-&#xD;

Still she was not supplied with work js fast a&#xD;

the cold, calm, and dignified manner in which she came, the coach was ready to start off, and still no&#xD;

s imagination, he thought, with his son's rervait,&#xD;
tliat be had better take the first opportunityof tell-&#xD;
igClifford the truth, melancholy as it was. And&#xD;
taking advantage of a proper opportunity, he had&#xD;
done so before he received"his second letter from&#xD;
Wilson:-&#xD;
"Mr LonD,-It was all a mistake; Miss F. is&#xD;

an iimiout thin road and panted with her silk cloak&#xD;

" P. S.-I have been to -, and have heard&#xD;

His Jordship was even more cautious than Wil-&#xD;
son wished hiim.to be ; for lie resolved not to com-&#xD;
municate the glad tidings to Clifford, cautiously or&#xD;
incautiously, as lie thought there would be no&#xD;
chance of his son's filfilling his engagements withI&#xD;
Miss Sandford, if he knew Agnes was living; es-I&#xD;
pecially, as her flight and her supposed death had 1&#xD;
proved to Clifford how necessary shie was to his&#xD;
happiness. Nay, lie went still farther; and re-&#xD;
solved that Clifford should never know, if he&#xD;
could possibly help it, that the report of her death&#xD;
Was false.&#xD;
How to effect this was the difficulty ; but wisely&#xD;
conceivming that Wilson was not inaccessible to a&#xD;
bribe, he offered lim, so much a-year, on condition&#xD;
of hi s'-ufferng his master to remain convinced of&#xD;
the truth of the story that Agnes and her child i&#xD;
had perished in the snow, and of intercepting tiall1&#xD;
letters which he fancied cuamne from Agnes ; telling&#xD;
him at the samoe time that , if he found lie hade&#xD;
violated the conditions, the annuity should inimne-d&#xD;
diately cease- I&#xD;
To this Wilson consented, and when Clifford re-&#xD;
covered, lie made his compliance with the terms h&#xD;
more easy, by desirimg Wilson. and the friends to c&#xD;
whom his connexion with Agnes had been known, p&#xD;
never to mention her name in his presence again, h&#xD;
if tley valued his health and reason, as the safety s&#xD;
of both depended on lis forgetting a womai, of t&#xD;
whom lie had never felt the value sufficiently till b&#xD;
lie had lost her forever.          II          a&#xD;
Soon after, hue married, and the disagreeable&#xD;
qualities of his vife made him recollect, with more e&#xD;
aimful regret, the chiarms and virtues of Agnes. .o&#xD;
fhie consequence was that lie plunged deeper than f&#xD;
ever into dissipation, and had recourse to intoxica- rc&#xD;
tion im order to baimsh cate and disagreeable re- li&#xD;
collections; and, Ahile year ,after year passed ft&#xD;
away in fruitless expectation of a child to inherit th&#xD;
the estate and the long-di sputed title, lie remem- or&#xD;
bered, whIm agoizing regrets, thpe beauty of his h&#xD;

perform his promises to the injured Agnes, he lad mi&#xD;
deprived hnitmse' of ,the heir he much coveted, and c&#xD;
of a wife who would have atidded dignity to'the&#xD;
title which lie bore, and been the delight and or- P&#xD;
namenit of his family.   -&#xD;
Such were their miserable feelings of Clifford-  ev&#xD;
such the corroding cares that robbed his mind of ai&#xD;
Its energy, and his body of health and vigor. n&#xD;

by afllunce and splendor, hie was disappointed sch&#xD;

first time condemning him unjustly, attributed i&#xD;
silence and neglect of her and her offspring to a&#xD;
degree of indifference and hard-heartedness At&#xD;
which human nature shudders, Clifford was feeling&#xD;
all the horrors of remorse, without the consoladona'&#xD;
of repentanc'-e&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
I iAvR before observed that one idea engrossed&#xD;
the mind and prompted the exertions or Agnes;&#xD;
and this was the probable restoration of her fN'-&#xD;
ther to reason. " Could I but once muore hear him&#xD;
call me by my name, and bless me with his for-&#xD;
giveness, I should die in peace; and something&#xD;
within me tells moe that my hopes will not be in&#xD;
vain ; and who knows but we niay pass a content-&#xD;
ed, if not a happy life, together yet  So toil on,&#xD;
toil on, Agnes and expect the fruit of thy labors."&#xD;
These words she was in the habit of repeating&#xD;
not only to Fanny and her next-door neighbors&#xD;
(whom she had acquainted with he' story ,)butoto&#xD;
herself as she sat at work, or traversed mime heath.&#xD;
Even in the dead of night she would start fmom a&#xD;
troubled sleep, and repeating these wordi, they&#xD;
would operate as a charm on her disturbed mind;&#xD;
and as she spoke the last sentence, she would fall&#xD;
into a quiet slumber, from which she awoke at&#xD;
daybreak to pursue with increased ahicrity the&#xD;
labors of the day.&#xD;
Meanwhile Agnes and her exemplary industry&#xD;
continued to engage the attention and idmiiration&#xD;
of the candid and liberal in the town of&#xD;
Mr. Seymour, who did not venture to inquire&#xD;
concerning her, of Fanny while ,ie lived atqher&#xD;
house, now often called'there to ask news of Ag-&#xD;
nes and her employment ; and his curiosity was&#xD;
excited to know to what purpose she intended to&#xD;
devote the money earned with so much labor, and&#xD;
hoarded with smich parsimonious care.&#xD;
But Fanny was as ignoritt on this stbjet as&#xD;
itself, and the only new information which she&#xD;
would give him was, that Agnes ha begmn to em-&#xD;
iloy herself in fancy-works, in orier to increase&#xD;
ier gains ; and that it was her intentionsoon' to&#xD;
end little Edward (then four years old) to thi&#xD;
own to offer artificial flowers, ornamented meedle-&#xD;
ooks, work-bags, &amp;amp;c., at the doors of the opulent&#xD;
nd humane.&#xD;
Nor was it long before this des-igmn was put in&#xD;
xecution ; and Mr. Sevmour hid the satisfaction&#xD;
f buyingall the lovely boy's first enigo himself,&#xD;
or presents to his daughters. The litihe merchant&#xD;
turned to his anxious mithier, bounding with de-&#xD;
ght, not at the good success of his trt venture,&#xD;
ir its importance he did not understand, but at&#xD;
ie kindness of Mr. Seymour, who 'had met him&#xD;
StIe road, conducted him to his house, and&#xD;
helped his daughters to load his pockets with&#xD;
makes, and put in his basket, in exchange for his&#xD;
merchandise, tongue, chicken, and. other things'to&#xD;
arry home to his mother.   '      1&#xD;
Agnes heard the child's narration with more&#xD;
measure than she had for some time ex perienced.&#xD;
They do not despise me, then," said she;." they&#xD;
ven respect me too much to offer ine pehuniary&#xD;
d,or presents of any kind, but in a waythat can-&#xD;
ot wound my feelings.",&#xD;

acked by thei recollection that lie whose wounded&#xD;
