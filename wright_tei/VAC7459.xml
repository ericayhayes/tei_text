CHAPTER L'&#xD;
&#xD;
CASTLE VANE-A YOUNG FISHERMAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
ON the'shores of the Sussex, there is no ob-&#xD;
ject that fills with a deeper' interest the eye of&#xD;
the tourist, both on account of its picturesqub&#xD;
aspect and itshistorical asstoiations; than Castle&#xD;
Vane. At the present time it is a stately ruin,&#xD;
but yet majestic in decay. Time, while rending,&#xD;
its massive towers; has also bound them together&#xD;
witistrong net-work of vines of ivy and creep-&#xD;
ing plants, so that they stand like venerable age&#xD;
pnorted by the entwining arm of'charity and&#xD;
filiallove.&#xD;
The prospect from the eminence -on which&#xD;
stands this noble ruin is varied-and'wide-extend-&#xD;

uiplands of aMerry England" retire, away till'&#xD;

with anchored shipping aidt defending fortresses.&#xD;

8&#xD;
&#xD;
class of men, who subsisted by fishing in the&#xD;
channel. From the terrace of the castle one&#xD;
could toss a penny into the chimney tops of two&#xD;
or three of the nearest cottages, though the&#xD;
dwellings were generally some distance apart,&#xD;
following the windings of a street around the&#xD;
a curving shore of the cove. There was an air of&#xD;
neatness and thrift about most of the habita-&#xD;
tions, each having a small garden patch and a&#xD;
yard in front wherein to dry their nets and fish.&#xD;
If there was any superiority in the appearance&#xD;
of either of these cabins over the other, it was to&#xD;
be claimed by one which stood near the foot of&#xD;
the cliff, and close to the path which wound&#xD;
from the beach to its summit. This superioriy&#xD;
consisted in its being whitewashed, and in hav-&#xD;
ing vines growing over the narrow doorway in&#xD;
imitation of an alrch, beneath which were two&#xD;
wooden benches, from which, persons seated&#xD;
upon them had a pleasant view of the channel&#xD;
with its moving craft. That spot, also, wherein&#xD;
the other fishermen dried their nets, was by the&#xD;
proprietor of this abode made.a flower garden,&#xD;
while on the surrounding rocks were spread his&#xD;
nets and sun-dried fish.&#xD;
One evening in May, in the year 1650, about&#xD;
half an hour before sunset, a fishing boat came&#xD;
sailing into the cove from the channel, and&#xD;
steered directly for the rude landing is front of&#xD;
the cottage 'we have described. its bow was&#xD;
shattered! and it was evidently leaking freely,.&#xD;
and kept from sinking oily by-the extraordinary&#xD;
exerions of a young fisherman, who was its sole;&#xD;
occupant, and who was :bailing out water con--&#xD;
stantly as he approached the shore: At -length&#xD;
the smack touched the beach, and with an ex-&#xD;
clamatiol of satisfaction the young man leaped&#xD;
on shore.&#xD;
Theldahgrln which the boat had ,been was&#xD;
apparMd *6 ore than, one in the village, and&#xD;
encouraging lhouts had been sent to the young&#xD;
man's'earfkeepup his strength and not lose&#xD;
his coiirag&amp;amp;. herefore, on reaching the land in&#xD;
efety, he foun&amp;amp; himself in the midst 'of some&#xD;
score of is group, composed of the fishers' wives,&#xD;
of maides, and of such old men as=had given&#xD;
oper=ctive service, They looked at the shat-&#xD;
tered bow of the boat with surprise, and while&#xD;
sone e6ngratulsied him with having gpt safely.&#xD;
tolandaoth isagerly inquired how e had got.&#xD;
solidly wrede :&#xD;
" It is of no consequence, friends," answered&#xD;
the young man, as he secured the boat-to one of&#xD;
he posts of the pier, "acei4ents will happen at&#xD;
* ,  ea, you know-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE 'UNG FISHERMAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
This was said with a pleasant laugh; but his&#xD;
mother, who drew near to welcome him after&#xD;
the danger she conceived he had been in from&#xD;
drowning-for he had been seen by her a league&#xD;
at sea, struggling to save his boat, which he had&#xD;
so gallantly brought in-knew that the smile&#xD;
was forced and unnatural to his usually frank&#xD;
and open face.&#xD;
" There is something in this," she said shak-&#xD;
ing her head and turning to two of her particu-&#xD;
lar gossips, " there is something in this matter&#xD;
more 'than Guilford sees fit to tell."&#xD;
The young man,having secured the craft high&#xD;
up on the beach and furled'the sails, shouldered&#xD;
a pair of. oars, and with a flushed brow, and a&#xD;
proud, defiant air, strode up towards the cottage,&#xD;
without regarding-'his friends, whom he left ex-&#xD;
amining the boat and wondering how it could&#xD;
have been so shattered unless it had been run&#xD;
into.&#xD;
-" That is it," asserted an old fisherman, who&#xD;
had carefully examined the broken shearing&#xD;
" she ha' been run into, an' by a heavier craft&#xD;
than herself. "&#xD;
The young fisherman, having deposited his&#xD;
oars in the becket above one of the cottage win-&#xD;
dows,.on the outside of the house, instead of&#xD;
going in, began to pace up and down in the lit-&#xD;
tle shell-covered walk before it. His eyes were&#xD;
restless and fiery,his attitude erect andewarlike,&#xD;
and ;his- heavy step seemed to fall tr the sound&#xD;
of a" trumpet. Something: evidently had' oc-&#xD;
curred to rouse in the bosom pf the young fish-&#xD;
erman all the pride, independence, and haughty&#xD;
resentment of the man; for beneath the fustian&#xD;
jacket may beat as much pride and sense of&#xD;
honor as beneath the ermine of u born noble.&#xD;
The appearance of 'the young fisherman was&#xD;
superior to that of young men of his class and&#xD;
occupation. This superiority did not consist in&#xD;
dreso, for his clothing-was as coarse and rude as&#xD;
that of any of his fellows ; nor in the symmetry&#xD;
of his person, for there were, in the hamlet. as&#xD;
well shaped young men as he ; but it was in the'&#xD;
noble expression of his whole form and face.&#xD;
He looked like onebor. rather to command&#xD;
those with whom ho daily associated, than to be&#xD;
merely their equal. This innate power in him&#xD;
they recognized, though it was never demanded&#xD;
by him f'or he eemed wholly unconscious of a&#xD;
superiority of which all others in the hamlet&#xD;
were instinctively conscious.- His face was&#xD;
handsome, and- perhaps- not less so for being&#xD;
browned by the sea winds till it'was almost as&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
dark as the Arabian. His eyes were black, and&#xD;
filled with intelligence and courage. As a sea-&#xD;
man he had no equal on the Sussex coast, of&#xD;
his age, all men acknowledged. As a fisherman&#xD;
he was skilled in the craft, in all its details, so&#xD;
that no one ever surpassed him in success. If&#xD;
other boats came back empty, Guilford Gra-&#xD;
ham's was sure to contain some fruits of his&#xD;
skill and patience. In trials of strength and&#xD;
agility in those holiday sports which the youths&#xD;
of the hamlet used to indulge in, challenging to&#xD;
competition some inland village, he always&#xD;
came off vctor. For filial obedience in support-&#xD;
ing a widowed mother, for manly protection of&#xD;
his beautiful cousin, Anne .Graham, for his fast&#xD;
abiding as a friend, and his reverence for holy&#xD;
things, Guilford was an example to all the&#xD;
young men on the coast. His popular manners,&#xD;
his constant cheerfulness and good nature, made&#xD;
him a general favorite ; and many a pretty1&#xD;
maiden sighed in her heart for the love of the&#xD;
handsome Guilford.&#xD;
" What aileth thee, my son ?" asked his moth-&#xD;
er. " Something hath gone across thy temper,'&#xD;
and shade thee vexed,-tell me what is the mat-&#xD;
ter with thee ?"&#xD;
He stopped in his fierce walk, turned, and&#xD;
taking both ber hands in his, he pressed them&#xD;
with affectionate respect, and looking her in the&#xD;
&#xD;
9&#xD;
&#xD;
face, would have spoken ; but some strong emo-&#xD;
tion rising, checked his utterance, and tears&#xD;
filled his eyes and ran down his cheeks. He re-&#xD;
leased her' hands, dashed the glittering drops&#xD;
from his face, and v'ould have walked away,&#xD;
when she gently held him.&#xD;
"Nay, Guilford, you must come and sit down&#xD;
in the porch and tell me what has happened.&#xD;
Tears in my brave boy's eyes ! Ah, something&#xD;
heavy has pressed upon thy soul this day, to&#xD;
force tears from thee !"&#xD;
" Come and sit down, mother, and I will tell&#xD;
thee," he said, after a moment's hiternal'-strug-&#xD;
gle. " You are wise and discreet, and may be&#xD;
able to advise me. But you will not despise me&#xD;
when you shall know all my rash folly ?"&#xD;
"You must first prove to me that you have&#xD;
been rash or foolish, who were never known to&#xD;
be so," said his mother, who, though humble in&#xD;
station and poorly attired, seemed to be, as he&#xD;
had said, a wise and discreet woman ; being a&#xD;
person of that plain common sense, so much&#xD;
oftener found in low conditions of life, than in&#xD;
tile more artificial circles of society ; and to her&#xD;
influence was owed, doubtless, his superiority,-&#xD;
for it is the woman that forms the character of&#xD;
the growing man, and her plastic hand leaves&#xD;
its impression on every moral outline.&#xD;

A NARRATIVE OF INTEREST.&#xD;
THE young man had led his mother to the   " ihat is not so certain, my boy," she said,&#xD;

THE YOUNG FISHERMAN.                11&#xD;
&#xD;
1"There are tales of noble maidens being loved&#xD;
and won' by lowly youths, mother," answered&#xD;
Guilford, with a certain light of hope and daring&#xD;
speaking in his fine eyes.&#xD;
" And only in tales ,are they won-never in&#xD;
reality and truth, my son." -        -&#xD;
" We will not talk of this now, mother. Hear&#xD;
what I have to say to thee touching what hath&#xD;
happened to-day."&#xD;
" That is what I would most listen to."&#xD;
"After I had embarked this morning for the&#xD;
channel grounds to fish, and when I had 'got out&#xD;
to the rocks over which we cast our lines, I&#xD;
lowered my sails and proceeded to fish as usual.&#xD;
It was a cloudless day, and the fish swam too&#xD;
deep for my hooks, and so I lay back listlessly&#xD;
in my boat, and amused myself, as I love to do&#xD;
when I am rocking alone in my boat out on the&#xD;
bounding sea, with gazing abgut me. A hun-&#xD;
dred craft similar to my own were riding gently&#xD;
upon the undulating waves, and here and there&#xD;
could be seen a tall ship with triple towers of&#xD;
white canvas, crossing from England to France&#xD;
or from France to England. But those-objects&#xD;
soon wearield my eyes, which very shortly rested&#xD;
upon the cliff and lordly tower that soars above&#xD;
our little hamlet. Its castellated angles and&#xD;
battlements were figured in strong, dark lines&#xD;
against the blue sky, and'it seemed the proper&#xD;
home of the noble' lord who dwells there."&#xD;
'You speak of our Castle Vane, my son."&#xD;
" Yes, mother. As my eye rested upon it, I&#xD;
could not but recall its fairest inmate ; for I&#xD;
never behold'it that I do not think less of every&#xD;
one it contains than of the Lady Catharine. To&#xD;
my imagination she seemed the' only dweller&#xD;
there. Nay, do not frown, mother. As I was&#xD;
gazing on the castellated pile, I recalled, not&#xD;
only the lovely face and form of Lady Catha&#xD;
rine, but the time when we first met. Do you&#xD;
remember it, dear mother ?"&#xD;
" Nay, I do not mind such little matters. It&#xD;
was so long ago thou shouldst scarce remind it.'&#xD;
" I shall'never forget it. It is a delight foi&#xD;
me to recall it, ad a joy to talk of it. It wa&#xD;
five years ago only. I was then nineteen, an&#xD;
it was my birth-day fete ; and on that occasion&#xD;
you had presented me with a new jacket, an&#xD;
cousin Anne had 'broidered for me a gay cap."&#xD;
"IAh, well do I recollect the jacket and cap&#xD;
and how gallant you looked in them my bOy."&#xD;
. "After supperI was going to a dance at Tin&#xD;
A Dowlin's, in honor of his pretty daughter Peggy'&#xD;
marriage, when, as I was crossing the road tha&#xD;
&#xD;
leads from the bench round by the mill, in order&#xD;
to reach Tim's before dark, I saw a horse com-&#xD;
ing towards me at full speed along the old Sus-&#xD;
sex road. On it was a young girl, who had lost&#xD;
all command'of the animal, who, with the 'reins&#xD;
flying, was evidently running away with her. '&#xD;
She did not shriek, nor speak a word, but as she&#xD;
approached me she cast on me such looks of&#xD;
appeal for succor, that, regardless, of danger, I&#xD;
threw myself with both'hands upon the horse's&#xD;
head, and dropping to the ground,.let him drag&#xD;
me several yards before he could be checked.&#xD;
At 'every leap forward he made, I expected to.&#xD;
feel his iron hoofs crushing into my chest ; but&#xD;
the beauty and imploring looks of the lovely&#xD;
girl, which seemed to appeal to me as her last&#xD;
and only hope of life, gave 'me courage, and&#xD;
strength; 'and at length I brought the horse's&#xD;
head and knees to the ground, and held him&#xD;
with a power of muscle that I have never felt&#xD;
the possession of since; until shegot from the&#xD;
saddle unharmed. I then released my hold of&#xD;
the horse, who furiously bounded away like the&#xD;
wind. My next thought was of the young girl&#xD;
. I had been instrumental in saving. She sprang&#xD;
towards me; grasped me by both hands in the&#xD;
warmest manner, and with eyes filled With tears,&#xD;
and smiling with gratitude, she said with emo-&#xD;
tion:&#xD;
" How can words thank you! How can aiy-&#xD;
thing I can express, young stranger, recompense&#xD;
you for the risk of life yog have run for el'&#xD;
" I need no thanks, lady," I said to her, " the&#xD;
consciousness of ydur safety is all the reward I&#xD;
can ask or wish for."&#xD;
" As I made her this answer, I looked, dear&#xD;
mother, with wonder upon the extraordinary&#xD;
t beauty of her face. I had never imagined there&#xD;
was such loveliness on earth.. She was about&#xD;
fifteen years of age, but with the charming rich.&#xD;
ness of form of one two or three years older.&#xD;
t Her eyes were a soft azure, that rivalled the&#xD;
bending blue of a summer sky on thb seg. Her,&#xD;
r hood was thrown back, and her golden tresses&#xD;
s dishevelled bythe swiftness with which her horse'.&#xD;
d had sped with her in his mad'flight, and I was&#xD;
completely bewildered with the glory of her&#xD;
I beauty.&#xD;
"'Will you tell me,' she said, in tones that&#xD;
have never ceaed to echo musically in my-souli&#xD;
' to whom Iam indebted for saving.me from .a&#xD;
a painful accident, or perhaps a dreadful death'11&#xD;

&#xD;
"'Dost thou know me, then ?' she asked,&#xD;
with a smile of surprise. 'I have not been here,&#xD;
before since I was a very little child.'&#xD;
"I do not know thy name, lady, but I see that&#xD;
thou art one of the high born of the land. I&#xD;
would, for thy sake, that he who has served&#xD;
thpe to-day had been thy equal. Shall Iremain&#xD;
near thee, as it is growing late, till thy party&#xD;
comes up, I asked of her, something gloomily,&#xD;
too, I fear, for I then, for, the first time, my&#xD;
mother, felt what it was to be born of low de-&#xD;
gree. To gaze upon one so fair and good, and&#xD;
so made to be loved, and feel that I could never&#xD;
be more to her-than a common hind-this--&#xD;
this made my cheek kindle and my very heart&#xD;
sink."&#xD;
" Guilford, thou art too 'ambitious ; be con-&#xD;
tent to be what thou art, or thou wilt be a mis.&#xD;
erable man. Thou canstnot change thy nature.&#xD;
Nobles are born nobles--fishermen are born fish-&#xD;
ermen. Do thy duty in what thou art."&#xD;
"It is well to talk, mother, but'that does not&#xD;
make one's wretchedness and consciousness of&#xD;
debasement the less."&#xD;
"Go on wig} thy story, for I never heard all&#xD;
this before."-&#xD;
"tNo, another ear, save that of my cousin&#xD;
Anne ; and she listened to it with but little in-&#xD;
terest to what thou dost, mother."&#xD;
- "Who -was this maiden ? am I right in guess-&#xD;
ing to be the Lady Catharine, on the day she&#xD;
came up to the- castle from London, where she&#xD;
had lived, since she was a child? "&#xD;
" Yes, mother. When I at length told her&#xD;
my name, she answered, that hers was Kate&#xD;
Vane."            ,&#xD;
" Lady Kate, you mean ? "&#xD;
"No. She said plain Kate Vane; and this,&#xD;
with the pretty way she spoke it, made me like&#xD;
her. I saw she was not proud, although' I told&#xD;
her I was a fisherman; for when she asked me&#xD;
to shower the way to the castle, and we walked&#xD;
on together, she. asked me a great.many ques&#xD;
tons about the sea, and the fishes, and the way&#xD;
I caught them; and said, of all things, she&#xD;
should like to go out some day in my boat, fish&#xD;
ing with me. Well, after half an hour's walk-&#xD;
the pleasantest half hour of my life, we reached&#xD;
the castle gate.  The day had already closed&#xD;
and the moon was shining brightly.' The-castl&#xD;
was in a scene of confusion and distress, and&#xD;
just as we entered, several persons with torches&#xD;
on foot and on horseback, were coining forth&#xD;
talking so loudly that we understood from their&#xD;
&#xD;
words that - the horse which Lady 'Kate had&#xD;
ridden had reached the castle, and that it was&#xD;
supposed she had been thrown and killed. But&#xD;
when she was seen and recognized, who shall&#xD;
describe the joy. I was quite overlooked in the&#xD;
first outburst of the surprise and delight of"all,&#xD;
and instantly withdrew. As I descended the&#xD;
path, I heard my name called by some one from&#xD;
the gate who had been sent for me,-doubtless&#xD;
after Lady Kate had time to, tell them to whom'&#xD;
she had been indebted for. her escape ; but as I&#xD;
had no wish to be Thanked by any other than&#xD;
Lady Catharine, I quickened my pace, and soon&#xD;
reached the road on the beach. Instead of going&#xD;
home, I'continued my original route to Tim's ;&#xD;
and as I passed the spot where I had stopped&#xD;
the horse, I paused to recall the scene, her face&#xD;
and voice. As I did so, my eyes were attracted&#xD;
by something which sparkled in the moonlight.&#xD;
I picked it up from the ground, and with pleasure&#xD;
discovered that it was a broken ring. It had&#xD;
evidently been broken by her strong grasp upon&#xD;
the bridle, and dropped in two pieces from her&#xD;
finger when she alighted.. It was a diamond&#xD;
set in a circle of pearls. I pressed it to my&#xD;
lips-"-&#xD;
" Daring boy !" said the mother, half pleased&#xD;
at his gallantry, yet half disapproving, knowing&#xD;
as she did the dangerous tendency of such emo-&#xD;
tions, when once awakened in the bosom  of a&#xD;
lowly born youth towards- a high-born maiden.&#xD;
She sighed while she smiled; but the smile&#xD;
passed, leaving a troubled air upon her calm and&#xD;
- sensible face. " You returned the ring, of course,&#xD;
Guilford?"&#xD;
"When next I saw her; but she bade me&#xD;
keep it, or rather offered me one in its place, as&#xD;
she saw Ivalued it as a memento; but when I&#xD;
told her I would prefer the broken one, found on&#xD;
I the spot where I had first the happiness.of seeing&#xD;
her, she told me I might keep it if I would wish&#xD;
I to."&#xD;
"And when and where did you meet her, my&#xD;
son'?."&#xD;
e " Only the next week after. I was coming in&#xD;
- from the channel, and steered my boat closer&#xD;
under the castle than usual, for I thought I saw&#xD;
d the form of a young girl on the white beach. I&#xD;
, was not deceived. It was the Lady Kate, gather-&#xD;
e ing shells. Upon recognizing me sailing past,&#xD;
, she beckoned to me to land., I did so, for I&#xD;
, wished to return the ring. She at once began&#xD;
, playfully to chide me for leaving the castle so&#xD;
r abruptly, without waiting to be thanked by her&#xD;
&#xD;
father and brother, and her friends, for what I had&#xD;
done. I told her I did not wish to be thanked&#xD;
at all; but if any one was to thank me, one word&#xD;
from her was a world of thanks. She then told&#xD;
me that she had been riding with her elder&#xD;
brother, who was dn Oxford student, then at&#xD;
home on a-visit, ahead of her party, when a shot&#xD;
fired by him from his saddle at a heron, had&#xD;
caused'her horse to take fright and run off with&#xD;
her. 'My brother,' she said, 'followed me, but&#xD;
as I turned to the left, while he took'to the&#xD;
left, he missed me ; and but for you I should&#xD;
have been killed, for I could not have kept my&#xD;
saddle three minutes longer, as I was fast losing&#xD;
all presence of mind. You must come up to the&#xD;
castle and let my father know you,' she added.&#xD;
But I told her that I was too lowly to be no-&#xD;
ticed by nobles, and that I was too proud to be&#xD;
compelled to feeltheir superiority. At this, she&#xD;
looked at me with a stare of beautiful surprise,&#xD;
and shaking her head she said archly :&#xD;
"'I fear you will 'be too proud to speak to me&#xD;
by-and-by.'&#xD;
"0, no, you don't understand me, lady."&#xD;
"'Yes I do, and what is more, I respect you&#xD;
for your feelings,' she added. 'I can conceive&#xD;
how one like you must feel when you are com-&#xD;
pelled to endure the superiority of others, who&#xD;
&#xD;
may, in reality, be your inferiors. But you will&#xD;
not find my father such a nobleman. He knows&#xD;
how to appreciate merit ; and as for my brother,&#xD;
I heard him say that he should find you out to&#xD;
thank you.'&#xD;
"I then offered to her the ring, which, 4a I&#xD;
said, she permitted me to retain. Seeing that&#xD;
she liked the beautiful shells which were scattered&#xD;
on the beach, of which she had a basket full, but&#xD;
of indifferent value, I offered to bring her others&#xD;
from the king's rock beach, where they are to be&#xD;
found of such rare colors. I then sailed to the&#xD;
beach and landed to take hey, basket, for our&#xD;
conversation had taken place while I was stand-&#xD;
ing in my boat, about ten yards from the land,&#xD;
when a young man, clad as a hunter, followed by&#xD;
a couple of dogs, caume round a jutting angte of&#xD;
the cliff. He was of the middle height, well&#xD;
made, with long flaxen hair flowing on his&#xD;
shoulders,.a brown, moustache, and a fair, red&#xD;
and white complexion.' He was exceedingly&#xD;
handsome, but an air of angry surprise which he&#xD;
put on upon discovering us, increased the dis-&#xD;
agreeable impression his naturally haughty bear-&#xD;
ing madeupon sie. I saw at a glance that he&#xD;
was a noble, and the exclamation of Lady Kate,&#xD;
'my brother !' told me who he was without fur.&#xD;
ther introduction."&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
A HAUGHTY INTERRUPTION.&#xD;
&#xD;
*"Tu young nobleman," resumed Guilford,&#xD;
continuing his narrative to his mother, in the&#xD;
green embowered porch of the cottage, "stood&#xD;
for an instant regarding fist one and then the&#xD;
other of us without a word. - He then strode up&#xD;
and said haughtily:&#xD;
" Who and what are you, that are so familiar&#xD;
as to hold converse with this lady, and with thy&#xD;
cap on, fellow ?' With these words he struck&#xD;
off my cap to my feet, and one of his dogs taking&#xD;
it up, carried it off, tearing it with his teeth&#xD;
"'1Lord Wilmot, how can you be so rash!' ex-&#xD;
claimed Lady Catharine, with a mingled ex-&#xD;
pression of pain for me and anger against him.&#xD;
'This is the young man, Guilford Graham.'&#xD;
"'And who, pray, is Guilford Graham ' he&#xD;
repeated, sarcastically.&#xD;
"'Have you forgotten the name of the brave&#xD;
youth, who, at the risk of his own life, saved&#xD;
mine '&#xD;
"'IHow should one remember every hind's&#xD;
name ? So, young man, you are the clown that&#xD;
risked your life and broke the jaw of the best&#xD;
horse in my father's stud ; for the horse, came to&#xD;
the castle with his jaw broken as with a sledge-&#xD;
hammer, and we had to 'shoot him. You have&#xD;
a hand like Samson. But you did'the thing&#xD;
well, thought it cost a horse worth a thousand&#xD;
guineas.'4&#xD;
&#xD;
"' Brother, how can you speak of su-ch a trifle,&#xD;
when my life was at stake '&#xD;
" ' True, but a discreet person should save one&#xD;
and not destroy the other. There, fellow, are&#xD;
four guineas ! I dare swear thou hast not seen&#xD;
so much gold together before, and that it would&#xD;
take a year's fishing to give thee in haid the&#xD;
same amount.'&#xD;
" As he spoke, he threw the gold at my feet.&#xD;
I did not notice it. I had felt insulted by his&#xD;
manner, as well as by his words, and by this act.&#xD;
I did not deign to glance towards him; but I&#xD;
looked in the face of Lady Catharine. Hereyes .&#xD;
were alight with just resentment. She felt that-&#xD;
I had been insulted, peasant as I was.&#xD;
"' Wilmot, why do     reward courage in&#xD;
such a strange fashion ?  ne would fancy you&#xD;
had found in this young  man a foe, rather than&#xD;
one to whom you owe a debt of gratitude.'&#xD;
"'Gratitude to one like him!' answered the&#xD;
young Lord Vane, with a contemptuous glance&#xD;
at the coarse apparel of Guilford. 'I have paid&#xD;
him for his service u gold.  What fault can he,&#xD;
find I By the rood ! " t'would seem, from the&#xD;
familiar manner in wl ich; I found him holding&#xD;
converse with you, K*e,:that he presumed more&#xD;
than becometh a hin&amp;amp; -Fellow, get into. thy&#xD;

hath made thee the mean instrument ofsaving&#xD;

&#xD;

from for speaking to her.'--&#xD;
"'He did but offer to collect shells for me,&#xD;
brother,' said the Lady Catharine, reproachfully,&#xD;
1I called to him. le is in no ways to blame.'&#xD;
"'Then it is you who are to blame, to de-&#xD;
scend to speak to a youth like this, who will&#xD;
boast in the ale-houses among his fellows that&#xD;
he has held tryst with the Lady Kate Vane.'&#xD;
" At these words, the eyes of the maiden flash-&#xD;
ed fire, but instantly filling with tears, she said:&#xD;
You are ungenerous, Rudolph.'&#xD;
" In the meanwhile," said Guilford, addressing&#xD;
his mother, "I stood amazed and burning with&#xD;
indignation ; and I really believe that if he had&#xD;
not been the brother of the fair Lady Catharine,&#xD;
I should have struck him to the earth for his in-&#xD;
sulting words to her. But finding that my pres-&#xD;
ence only made him more bitter towards her,&#xD;
and fearing a collision, which might render it&#xD;
necessary for me to strike him in self-defence, I&#xD;
got into my boat, but taking the basket with me,&#xD;
resolved to redeem my promise to bring it to&#xD;
her on some more auspicious day, filled with the&#xD;
shells she so greatly admired. I therefore made&#xD;
sail and left them on the beach at the foot of&#xD;
the castle; but soon I saw them together mak-&#xD;
ingstheir'way up the path to the gate-way at the&#xD;
- round tower."&#xD;
" And then you made anenemy-of young Lord&#xD;
Vane forever."&#xD;
" It may be so. He, soon afterwards left for&#xD;
Oxford, where he has remained the most of the&#xD;
time until three days ago, when he returned."&#xD;
"Tid you receive and take away the gold ?"&#xD;
" No; I saw him stoop and gather it up after&#xD;
I had sailed away. The obligation to me,&#xD;
therefore, on his part, remained in full force as&#xD;
at first.".&#xD;
' "And hast thou seen the Lady Catharine since&#xD;
then, my son ? " asked his mother, earnestly.&#xD;
" Often an4 often, dearest mother; for it was&#xD;
not many, days afterwards that 1I left for her&#xD;
upon the beach, while, from the terrace of the&#xD;
castle she was looping down and .saw me, the&#xD;
basket of shells, which I soon beheld her descend&#xD;
and take up. I have met her in the forest path ;&#xD;
I have seen her at the castle on gala-days ; I&#xD;
have encountered her on the snowy beach by&#xD;
moonlight."&#xD;
"You meet the Lady Catharine by noon-&#xD;
light ? You say what oversteps the truth, I fear."&#xD;
" Nay, mother, we have often met, and walked&#xD;
and discoursed together upon the glorious works&#xD;

three years past I had been permitted to have&#xD;
companionship with an angelhof intelligence and&#xD;
love. 0, how she has elevated my soul, ex-&#xD;
panded my mind, enlarged my views, purified&#xD;
the gross in me, and cultivated the virtues, which&#xD;
knew not how to grow aright. If I am superior&#xD;
to what I then was, if Iam called by the villagers&#xD;
wiser and better than others, it is 'to her sweet&#xD;
teaching in those stolen hours which we have&#xD;
consecrated together to friendship."'&#xD;
" Guilford! you fill me with amazement. I&#xD;
tremble at what I hear you utter ! Can all this&#xD;
be so? Yet it must be ; you could not deceive&#xD;
me; and besides,I have now in my mind nu-&#xD;
merous little circumstances which the revelation&#xD;
on your part gives me a full explanation of.&#xD;
How wonderful it all is ! You, mf son-the&#xD;
son of E humble fisherman, the chosen friend&#xD;
and confidant of a noble and high-born maiden,&#xD;
the daughter of a lord ! It is difficult to believe&#xD;
it., But it is said woman's heart, when it chooses,&#xD;
looks not to title, nor rank, nor dress, but for a&#xD;
kindred heart; and perhaps that, though.one is&#xD;
born in the castle and the other at the foot of&#xD;
the castle, the same spirit may be animating&#xD;
your bosoms. But the Lady Kate is young ;&#xD;
she has seen but little of the world. She is&#xD;
hardly conscious of the impassable gulf that lies&#xD;
between you and her -own high station. This&#xD;
romance, sweet and pleasant as it has been to&#xD;
you, must be broken. Her hand will be asked&#xD;
by some proud noble, and she will give it to him,&#xD;
and then she will be ashamed.that she has, been&#xD;
so foolish as to descend to your level. Trust&#xD;
me, R my dear boy, this wild dream must be&#xD;
broken. Let me advise you to see her no more.&#xD;
Better for your own feelings that you withdraw&#xD;
now from an intimacy that-cannot be perpetual,&#xD;
which is so extraordinary, than wait to be cast&#xD;
off with infamy. She is now nineteen, and&#xD;
what pleased her at fifteen, may disgust her&#xD;
now:"&#xD;
" You do not know her, my dear mother," an-&#xD;
swered the young man, his generous face light-&#xD;
ing up with generous warmth in defence of Lady&#xD;
Kate. " She 'feels no differently towards me&#xD;
now than at all other times. She will never&#xD;
give her hand to any noble of them all."&#xD;
" This is a bold speech. Wouldet thou bind&#xD;
her tot thyself, Guilford ? If, in. the innocence&#xD;

have bound herby no pledges. I have dared to&#xD;
exact no promises from her. I have not thought&#xD;
of any happiness gr consummation of our pure&#xD;
friendship, beyond the sweet bliss of the present&#xD;
hour."&#xD;
"You are then both rash and imprudent. You&#xD;
are wasting a generous heart upon one whoan&#xD;
never be more to you than she now is, and she&#xD;
&#xD;
is wasting upon you affections which can never&#xD;
find their fruition ; for the natural tendency of&#xD;
such attachments as it appears exist between&#xD;
you and Lady Catharine, is, a union by marriage,&#xD;
and to this result the opposite ranks you occupy&#xD;
in society must forever put a bar. You, there-&#xD;
fore, are doing her irreparable injury, and en-&#xD;
dangering the wreck of her whole life's happi-&#xD;
ness, by encouraging by your continued presence&#xD;
in her society, a passion which can only end in&#xD;
sorrow, tears, and wretchedness to you both."&#xD;
"I see-I see, dear mother ! Your words&#xD;
have opened my eyes. I behold my position as&#xD;
you behold it, and am conscious that it is a false&#xD;
one. Mother, I will see her no more-no more&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
A MOTHE'S COUNSEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
Tan young fisherman ventured the last word&#xD;
in a tone of sadness, and with his forehead bowed&#xD;
down upon his mother's hand, upon which hot&#xD;
tears dropped, one after the other, like rain.-&#xD;
" Thou hast spoken well; thou hast spoken&#xD;
like a man. Heaven give thee strength to abide&#xD;
by thy words," she said, impressively.&#xD;
"No more I" he repeated, in a tone of unutter-&#xD;
able anguish. ".I see that I shall destroy her&#xD;
hopes, her happiness, her future, if I suffer this&#xD;
mad dream of bliss to go on. But it will rend&#xD;
my heart 1"&#xD;
" Nay, be strong in a sense of rectitude and&#xD;
manly consciousness of acting tight. Thou wilt&#xD;
not hesitate to sacrifice thyself for her, if thou&#xD;
lovest her."°&#xD;
"Love her !"&#xD;
"Then reflect that it is for her whom you&#xD;
lovefyou make this sacrifice of never beholding&#xD;
her more. As it is, she, can never marry in her&#xD;
own rank, as becomes her; for thou hast her&#xD;
heart, 'for which, nevertheless, thou canst give&#xD;
her no return."&#xD;
"No returnI--true, true. tI can jive her only&#xD;
my heart again. I have no rank, no castles, no&#xD;
place at court, no historic name, no wealth, no&#xD;
power, to return to her. Mother, you are wiser&#xD;
than I-far'wiser. The dream is past ; I will&#xD;
see her but once more !"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Nay, not that once."&#xD;
" Can I steal from her away, dear mother 1.-.&#xD;
shall I cease my interviews with her without a&#xD;
word of explanation'? Shall I add to our sepa-&#xD;
ration the barb of suspicion that I have done&#xD;
aught that makes me ashamed to see her, or&#xD;
that she has given me aught of office ? Nay,&#xD;
it is becoming that we meet once more-to port&#xD;
forever."&#xD;
"Perhaps you are right, my son. I will trust&#xD;
to your good sense that this interview be so con-&#xD;
ducted as to release you both from any indiscreet&#xD;
pledges of fidelity into which you may both have&#xD;
unadvisedly fallen. When will you have this&#xD;
interview?"&#xD;
"This very night."&#xD;
"The sooner the better for you both, Now,&#xD;
my boy, explain to me what you began to do&#xD;
when you sat down here-how your boat came&#xD;
so dreadfully wrecked."&#xD;
"I deserved it, I see, since we have had this&#xD;
talk together. I will explain in a few words.&#xD;
You know,E perhaps, that young Lord Rudolph&#xD;
has returned 1 the castle within a few days'?"&#xD;
"I heard so from your -cousin Anne."&#xD;

sprang on board, and taking the Lady Catharine&#xD;
up, regained the yacht with her. The shock&#xD;
drove the bows of my boat in, and she began to&#xD;
fill. The yacht, .recoiling from' the contact,&#xD;
glided past across the bows, and as Lord Vane&#xD;
saw me making efforts to keep my boat from&#xD;
going down, he laughed like a fiend, and. then&#xD;
deliberately aiming a short' gun at me, dis-&#xD;
charged it. I should have been killed by the ball&#xD;
if I had not thrown myself upon my face.&#xD;
[sEE ENGRAVING.]&#xD;
" The next moment the yacht was far to lee-&#xD;
ward, and I was left alone with my sinking boat !&#xD;
What a moment of shame, disappointment, and&#xD;
bitterness was that to me ! What an hour of&#xD;
happiness, had been suddenly interrupted ! I&#xD;
now turned my whole attention 1o saving' my&#xD;
boat and my life. - But my ears were Tended by&#xD;
the cries of Lady Kate to her brother, not to let&#xD;
me perish. But I could hear his scornful laugh&#xD;
only in reply.&#xD;
"By great exertions,,my dear mother, I&#xD;
reached the cove as you saw; but if I had been&#xD;
half a mile further ont, I should certainly have&#xD;
been lost. Now, mother, you know all. I have&#xD;
unfolded to you the secret of my life. You are&#xD;
my only confidant. Perhaps I have done wrong&#xD;
in encouraging this sweet friendship on the part&#xD;
of Lady Kate. But should I dash the cup of&#xD;
bliss to the ground?  I was not' wise enougl'to&#xD;
know that it was charged with sorrow to us&#xD;
.* both. I can now look on all with your eyes. I&#xD;
see that I have been in the wrong, and that I&#xD;
have been inflicting a positive injury upon her&#xD;
whom I would die .to serve. I see it-I see it&#xD;
all! I cannot so much blame Lord Vane fol&#xD;
wishing to break off a friendship that was laden&#xD;
with so much future evil.",&#xD;
"I am glad to ,see you take this view of it,&#xD;
Guilford. It shows me that you are still as good&#xD;
and generous and just as I have always believed&#xD;
you to be. No doubt that Lady Catharine loves&#xD;
you; but do you think-now hear me put the&#xD;
question with calmness -do you think she would&#xD;
-  listen to you with anything less than with sur-,&#xD;
prise and scorn, if you proposed seriously for her&#xD;
hand ?"&#xD;
Guilford shook his head, but made no reply.&#xD;
"I fear that such a proposal from you would&#xD;
&#xD;
open her eyes, which seem to have been strangely&#xD;
blinded, and lead her to see the true position in&#xD;
which you stood to each other. It would break&#xD;
the spell effectually. Doubtless she, as well as&#xD;
yourself, has never asked of her heart and judg-&#xD;
ment where all this would end."&#xD;
"I will see her once more, and then we part&#xD;
forever-unless-" Here a certain proud light&#xD;
shone in his fine eyes, and he rose to his feet.&#xD;
" Unless what, Guilford ?" asked hi's mother,&#xD;
with anxiety, fearing all his resolutions were&#xD;
to be turned into thin air.     -&#xD;
"Unless I can render myself worthy of her,&#xD;
mother !"&#xD;
" Worthy of her! Indeed, so far as truth and&#xD;
honor and manly domeliness are concerned, you&#xD;
are worthy the love of any maiden, .methinks,&#xD;
Guilford ; but these count nought in the sum of&#xD;
qualifications which he who would wed a lord's&#xD;
daughter must bring to his aid."&#xD;
"I may yet make myself worthy of her, moth-&#xD;
er. In the books of history which she has loaned&#xD;
me, and which we have read together, are ac-&#xD;
counts of lowly-born, youths having risen to&#xD;
thrones, and to wed kings' daughters. Nothing&#xD;
is impossible to love and ambition !"&#xD;
.", That was in the days of Romaunt, long&#xD;
ago, my boy. Such things do not happen now."&#xD;
' o one knows. What is enacting now?-&#xD;
who is President of England, and who sits in&#xD;
the seat of the long line of descended kings ? Is&#xD;
it not Oliver Cromwell, who rose from the ranks&#xD;
of the people? Even Lord Rudolph Vane must&#xD;
lift his cap to this man of humble origin."&#xD;
" Trueimy son, the people have the power.'&#xD;
"Yes, and the nobles hold their castles and&#xD;
their coronets at the will of the Lord Protector.&#xD;
Because I am a fisherman now, shall I of neces-&#xD;
sity always he one? Thanks to the teachings&#xD;
of the Lady Catharine, I have knowledge and&#xD;
learning, and know how to hold such place as&#xD;
my good fortune may perchance elevate' me to.&#xD;
From this day I doff the fisher's jacket, and go&#xD;
and offer my services to the admiral of the fleet,&#xD;
now in the Thames and preparing to sail against&#xD;
the Dutch. There all grades are 'open to talent&#xD;
and aspiration; and with the star of Lady Kate's&#xD;
love shining ever above the horizon of my future,&#xD;
I shall yet win some place worthy of her!"&#xD;
" Ah, my son, you do mot reflect that a suc-&#xD;
cessful officer under Cromwell's power would be&#xD;
an unsuccesgful wooer for the band of a daugh-&#xD;
ter of so proud and royal a noble as Lord Vane.&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
&#xD;
COUSIN ANNE GREY-A SURPRISE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Tun maiden who betrayed this interest in&#xD;
the young man was Anne Grey, his cousin, and&#xD;
the adopted child of her aunt, his mother. She&#xD;
was a beautiful girl of eighteen, with dark brows&#xD;
and eyes, and handsome cheeks and lips, and a&#xD;
neat figure, buoyant with the elasticity of health.&#xD;
She had daily employment at the castle by Lady&#xD;
Vane, who gave occupation to several maidens&#xD;
of humble degree in the art of embroidery, a&#xD;
pursuit then much in vogue with the high-bern&#xD;
dances of England.&#xD;
Evpry morning for two years past, Anne had&#xD;
gone to the castle, to pass the day in the .ldrge&#xD;
hall or working-room, where the lady of the&#xD;
castle, seated in the midst of her half-score of&#xD;
maidens, either taught them difficult figures in&#xD;
the pattern by her own example, or passed from&#xD;
one to the other, giving directions.&#xD;
" Have you completed that battle-piece of&#xD;
Hastings's field yet ?" asked dame Graham of&#xD;
Anne, as the latter seated herself, by the frugal&#xD;
supper prepared for her and Guilford, but which&#xD;
the latter had left untouched.&#xD;
"Not yet, aunt; we expect to complete it by&#xD;
June. We have been already twenty-one months&#xD;
upon it. We had to wait three weeks for the&#xD;
arrival of the young lord before we could finish,&#xD;
his figure."-&#xD;
2&#xD;
&#xD;
"What, does my young lord figure in the&#xD;
tapestry ?"&#xD;
" Yes, as one of the king's youthful knights.&#xD;
He has taken a' good many sittings, and. the&#xD;
portrait is to the life ; but Lady Vane drawsaud&#xD;
works in the features herself, while we only&#xD;
work the surtout and armor."&#xD;
".What think you of my young lord ?"&#xD;
"Something bold and free, methinks.'&#xD;
" So I fancied, if he be like other nobles of his&#xD;
degree. I hope, child, he hath not noticed&#xD;
thee."&#xD;
" I like not his looks at all, aunt. He hath&#xD;
twice spoken to me in a manner that has made&#xD;
my cheek burn. I would gladly find some ex-&#xD;
cuse not to go up to the castle until he shall be&#xD;
gone back to London."&#xD;
" Tell not thy cousin Guilford of this."&#xD;
"Nay, he would care little. He careth-not for&#xD;
me," she answered, changing color.&#xD;
" Ah, and is it this way blows the wind, my&#xD;
child ?"&#xD;
" Which wayj aunt ?"&#xD;
"I see thou lovest Guilford more than thou.&#xD;
shouldst as a relative."&#xD;
"I did not say so, aunt. Yet who can help&#xD;

the dae&#xD;

"Dear, bless us, what stirring times'! But&#xD;

"We did not ask them, and I did not care to&#xD;

"JTust like you.. Well, I know. Listen, Miss&#xD;
Anne. , The king's son,. Prince Charles, has&#xD;
made a break from some place where they had&#xD;
him penned in, away off in the Scot's country,'&#xD;

he's trying to fly across theseas. So, you un-&#xD;
derstand, he has sent-vessels tb'every port-where&#xD;
he could, to keep watch and to examine every&#xD;
boat that puts off; and heieron the south, of&#xD;
England, he has sent troops t6 guard the coast,&#xD;
and ,especially every place where there are fish-'&#xD;
ing;boats.; Sn at this -moment there is not a&#xD;
chance for, the prince- to' get out of England&#xD;
without being seen and taken. All along the&#xD;
toa'Crdmwdl's soldieis:are quartered, and are&#xD;

"Poor Prince Charles !" replied the fisher-&#xD;
man's widow; "he is, I fear, destined to fall&#xD;
into the hands of his enemies."&#xD;
" We must. speak low when we mention his&#xD;
name, dame," answered 'Digby. - "But gpod-&#xD;
night !-I must go, for I've got.to tell the news&#xD;
to a good many. Stirring times--stirring times!&#xD;
Good night, fair Miss Anne !"&#xD;
With these words, the, village news-bearer&#xD;
hastened from the cottage.&#xD;
" I do really hope they will have their labor&#xD;
for their paiis," said Anne. "Poor Prince&#xD;
Charles has been hunted till he has no place left&#xD;
to hide his head 1"&#xD;
"It is to be hoped he may escape."&#xD;
"Aunt, there is some one looking in upon us&#xD;
at the back window !" suddenly exclaimed&#xD;
Anne.&#xD;
The dame turned her head, and as she did so,&#xD;
the window was raised, and a man stepped into&#xD;
the room. His appearance- struck them with&#xD;
surprise and curiosity, He wore a plain peas-&#xD;
ant's dress, soiled' and travel-worn, an old fhr-&#xD;
cap, that covered his eyes and 'early concealed&#xD;
his features, which were pale and well-shape.e&#xD;
There was an air bf'superiority about hlhn that&#xD;
led dame Graham to suspect that he was seie&#xD;

"You are a wonkn-you are compassionate-&#xD;

and throw myself on your mercy!"&#xD;
" Come, follow me," quietly said the dage,&#xD;
speaking with-decision and promptness. "Anne,&#xD;
place that food in his hands."-&#xD;
A' plate of' provisions from the table was&#xD;
handed to him by the maitien, and he followed&#xD;
dame Graham: out ' of the room like one aecus-&#xD;
tomed to ask--and find shelter in this 'manner.&#xD;
There was a ladder in the adjoining apartment&#xD;
which led to a loft.&#xD;
'Ascend 'this and you will find a bed and&#xD;

He pressed her hand gratefully, and ascended&#xD;
the ladder, which, at her direction, he drew up&#xD;
after him. He then closed the opening, so that&#xD;
no sign of the trap was apparent from below.&#xD;
She then returned to Anne, whom she impressed&#xD;
with the importance of keeping the secret of the&#xD;
presence of the fugitive from every one.&#xD;
" Have you any idea who it is, aunt ?"&#xD;
"I have my guess. It is either the prince&#xD;
himself, or one of his friends."&#xD;
&#xD;
" 0, that it were the prince, and we could get&#xD;
him safe across the channel !" exclaimed the&#xD;
beautiful girl, with warmth.&#xD;
" This is sooner said than executed. I sin-&#xD;

of a hunted deer'after being pressed from every&#xD;

of the hunter. But.here come the men."&#xD;
"Now, Anne, let not our looks or manner or&#xD;
words betray to these soldiers that we have a&#xD;
secret to keep."'&#xD;
While the goodwoman was giving this piece&#xD;
of caution to her neice, the two parliamentary&#xD;
troopers came in, making noise enough with&#xD;
their heavy boots and jingling swords, for half a&#xD;
score of modern dragoons.&#xD;
"Well, mistress, we have been taking a survey&#xD;
of thy premises around, walking about thereof,&#xD;
-as the Israelites circumvented the walls .of&#xD;
Jericho; but verily, not seven times, 'or we had&#xD;
no desire that thy walls should fall down, con-&#xD;
sidering that we look for'them to give us shelter&#xD;

Lord and of Gideon !"&#xD;
With this, Broad-way, who had seated his un-&#xD;
wieldly form upon a bench by the table, un-&#xD;
buckled his huge sword and handed it to Anne,&#xD;
who tookit, though it required no little strength&#xD;
to lift it, with its iron scabbard, and hung it&#xD;
upon a wooden peg near the window.&#xD;
".And Jake thou this fiery sword, lass, and put&#xD;
it safely on yonder beckets," said Strait-gate,&#xD;
with a_ solemn, nasal drawl. " Phuf !-verily,&#xD;
brother Broad-way, I smell the savor of strong&#xD;
waters, ,spiced with fragrance as the incense of&#xD;
Aaron, that flowed down his garment skirts&#xD;

"Yea, the flavor thereof ascendeth to my nos-&#xD;

many colors. -Dame, whence ariseth this de-&#xD;
lectable odor .' asked Broad-way, snuffingthe&#xD;
air of the room about him like a bill of Ba-&#xD;
shan ; while Strait-gate, erect and thin-visaged,&#xD;
in his hair, rolled his eyes on all sides to dis-&#xD;
cover whence came the fragrance which had so&#xD;
captivated their virtue.&#xD;
bIt is but the fumes of a negus which I have&#xD;
been making. My son will be in soon, and as&#xD;
the night is s a ething chilly, and as he:has&#xD;
gone out without his supper, I would give him&#xD;
some refresh nent when he'comes in.'?&#xD;
-"Vferily, thou art a mother in Israel," an-&#xD;
swered Bi ad-way. " Suppose 'thou' regardest&#xD;
meas thy son in Jacob and thy posterity in&#xD;
Abraham, and give me of the negus even, verily,&#xD;
as dacobgave to Esau of the pottage when he&#xD;
was a-hungry."&#xD;
&#xD;
Dame Gral am rose at once, and taking from&#xD;
a small cupboard an earthen mug, which bek.&#xD;
about a quart, she poured from it into two cups&#xD;
all that she had reserved for Guilford'of what&#xD;
she had made 'for the concealed guest,&#xD;
The two soldiers had no sooner inhaled and&#xD;
tasted the potation, than they manifested their&#xD;
approbation of her skill in concocting agreeable&#xD;
potations.&#xD;
"Verily," said Strait-gate, "this 'is, richer&#xD;
than the wines of Judea and the dew of the little&#xD;
hills of Hermon."&#xD;
" Yea, verily, it is the dew of Lebanon;" an-&#xD;
swered Broad-way, with unction.&#xD;
"The good dame must fill up the quart meas-&#xD;
ure once more ; for verily, with such strength as&#xD;
this giveth to the' arm'of a servant of the Lord,&#xD;
we shall overthrow our' enemies and discomfit&#xD;

hither, maiden, for thou art fair andcomely to&#xD;

"Nay, brother, the maiden' will do better, to&#xD;

Anne very willingly complied, and was not- a&#xD;

as she gave her the bucket, "Remain without&#xD;

THE YOUNG. FISHERMAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
But Anne, blushing and terrified, bounded&#xD;
past the pious covenanters and gained the out-&#xD;
side of the door. But she fled from thearms of&#xD;
* the men of war to fall into the arms of a fine.&#xD;
looking youth of her own station, who was in&#xD;
the act of knocking for admission as she opened&#xD;
the door.&#xD;
" Why, Robin !" she exclaimed, as she with-&#xD;
drew her form from his arms, which had inclosed&#xD;
her almost of necessity, so completely she came&#xD;
into them.&#xD;
"And you, Anne'! Whither with such haste?&#xD;
0, I see, you have the bucket. Let me fetch&#xD;
the water for thee."&#xD;
"Nay, speak low, and come right away from&#xD;
the door. If you must talk, talk at the spring.:&#xD;
There are two of those dreadful troopers in the&#xD;
house."&#xD;
" What, Cromwell's brigands ?" repeated the&#xD;
young fellow, in tones that rung like a Damas-&#xD;
cus blade.&#xD;
"Hush I" she cried, pressing her small hand&#xD;
afint his mouth to stop his words. "If you&#xD;
are overheard you are lost.  Come with me&#xD;
quick, and I will tell you all that has happened."&#xD;
He took the pail from her, and followed her&#xD;
lightstep across a stile and into a-remote corner&#xD;
of pmddock, where,,beneath a clump of alders,&#xD;
Subled a sparkling spring, with an abundance&#xD;
of water, which, overrunning, sought its way in&#xD;
p booklet to the sea, five hundred yards off.&#xD;
"You seem disturbed, .Anne.   Have these&#xD;
troopers been insolent ?" demanded the young&#xD;
man, who was plainly of a fiery temper, and hack&#xD;
a profound regard for the maiden.&#xD;
"Mien did you ever hear "of these soldiers&#xD;
being beneath a roof that they were not inso-&#xD;
e   eshrew me ! they would have kissed me&#xD;
if Would have suffered it of their ugly, great,&#xD;
l airy mouths 3"&#xD;
I will kill them both !"&#xD;
"Nay, Robin, that would be to the death of&#xD;
three men; for assuredly thou wouldst be the&#xD;
third. They did not kiss me,however, for I ran&#xD;
away.",&#xD;
" The hounds ! To presume to think of what&#xD;
I hardly dare dream of--pressing thysweet lips!"&#xD;
"Nay, Robin, don't talk of love now. You&#xD;
may stay here and keep me company till Guil-&#xD;
ord comes home, if you will be sure to behave&#xD;
yourself.'&#xD;
" Ah, Anne, you are ever so cruel to me,&#xD;
Why do I woo and sue, and woo in vain.'? said&#xD;
the young man, seating himself by her side on&#xD;
&#xD;
the stone bench that half encircled the spring.&#xD;
" Do not compel me to sigh for you, and love&#xD;
you, and live only with your thought, while, you&#xD;
treat me so disdainfully."&#xD;
"I love you, Robin; but I do not love you yet&#xD;
well enough to be your wife. If I ever marry&#xD;
any one but-it shall be your."&#xD;
"But who ? whose name fills the space you&#xD;
only breathed ?"&#xD;
" Do you not guess ?" asked the ingenuous&#xD;
girl.&#xD;
"I can think of no one but Guilford."&#xD;
"You are right. It is Guilford who alone&#xD;
keeps me from loving you as you. ought to, be&#xD;
loved. I have nothing against you; I am grate-&#xD;
ful for selecting me out of all the maidens of the&#xD;
hamlet,; but I love Guilford."&#xD;
" Only as a cousin."&#xD;
"I wish it were only as a cousin. I fear I&#xD;
love him with all my heart."&#xD;
" Happy Guilford ! He is my best friend-he&#xD;
destroys my happiness. Does he love thee ?&#xD;
But why do I ask the question?  Who can help&#xD;
loving thee, Anne, that knows thee ?"&#xD;
"Frankly, then, I- fear he loves me only as a&#xD;
cousin, and has no suspicion of my attachment&#xD;
for him. That makes me wretched. ,1 fear his&#xD;
heartis pre.engaged."&#xD;
"Would that it were !"&#xD;
" It would then break the dream of my life,&#xD;
and I should perhaps awake, Robin, to the reali-&#xD;
ties of thy love. You see I am frank andppen-&#xD;
hearted with you. Your long attachment fq r,&#xD;
me demands frankness and the absence': of all&#xD;
mystery."&#xD;
"You are goodness itself ! If, then, Guilford&#xD;
should be discovered to have given his heart to&#xD;
another, may2I then hope, dearest Anne ?",&#xD;
" Yes ; for thete is no one next to him I think&#xD;
so highly of as you."&#xD;
This undisguised expression of her feelings&#xD;
filled the young man with joy. He pressed ;er&#xD;
hand to his lips with devotion and ardoreand&#xD;
she could see that his.features were animate with&#xD;
hope and joy.&#xD;
As they sat by the spring they heard the voices&#xD;
of the two tipsy troopers singing through their&#xD;
noses a long-winded psalm, the sounds of which&#xD;
reaching the ears 7of other soldiers, q rteed&#xD;
about in other huts, inspired them also with&#xD;
devotional psalmody, and soon the whole iage&#xD;
was 'roaring with a confused noise of sgngb,&#xD;
which came louder from the village inn th&#xD;
from any other quarter.&#xD;
&#xD;
/',&#xD;
&#xD;
WHEN Guilford left the threshold of the cot-&#xD;
tage to take his way towards Castle yane, in&#xD;
order to obtain a final interview with the'beauti-&#xD;
ful and high-born maiden who had given him&#xD;
the preference of her -pure affections, he walked&#xD;
for some minutes at the quick, impetuous step&#xD;
which his agitated feelings prompted. But after&#xD;
'losing sight of the gate of 'the hut, and he had&#xD;
come upon the white sandeach, on which the&#xD;
moonbeams shone like silver, and upon the hard,&#xD;
marble-like floor of which the sparkling waves&#xD;
unrolled themselves like countless blue' scrolls&#xD;
edged with pearl, the sweet influences of the&#xD;
Scene carried quiet and comparative serenity to&#xD;
his soul. Gradually his footsteps slackened, and&#xD;
at length he came to a full stop and looked off&#xD;
and upward.&#xD;
" Why should I let a storm stage in my bosom&#xD;
hen illgiature is so peaceful? The blue skies&#xD;
are soft and fair and the stars sparkle in them&#xD;
like  celestial- eyes, looking peace and jor on&#xD;
earth, while the heavens of my soul are clouded,&#xD;
andnot a star of hope is glimmering in their&#xD;
wide horizon. Why," he mused-" why should&#xD;
I let mnere feelings torture ne so that I-am more&#xD;
like one bereft of reason at the idea of losing&#xD;
ady- Catharine, than a sane man ? Let me&#xD;
borrow peace and calmness from the ocean, the&#xD;
ky, the stars, the whole repose of nature. I will&#xD;
&#xD;
be calm ! I will reflect hpon all this which has&#xD;
come upon me, with firmness and honesty of&#xD;
conviction. My mother is right ; . I am doing&#xD;
the Lady Catharine wrong by thus holding her&#xD;
affections. My-mother is right; she cap never&#xD;
look upon me as her husbftnd. -She is infatuated.&#xD;
We have both been blind. I will be the first to&#xD;
break the spell. She will respect me the better&#xD;
for it. I will act as becomes a man of honor.&#xD;
She shall never have reason to despise me.&#xD;
But," he added, as he paced slowly along the&#xD;
glittering beach, and mechanically picked up a&#xD;
shining shell for her, "how shall I obtain an&#xD;
interview with her without encountering her&#xD;
brother ? Not that I fear him; but my hand&#xD;
would shrink from a contact with one so nearly&#xD;
related to her. No doubt he would not hesitate&#xD;
to slay me on the first-sight, andtherefore did I&#xD;
bring weapons with me ; but I shall use them&#xD;
only in self-defence."          -&#xD;
He now proceeded along the'beach for two&#xD;
hundred yards further, when he came to a jutting&#xD;
part of the cliff, on which the castle stood, which,&#xD;
advancing across the beach some yards into the&#xD;
water, stopped further progress on foot; but on&#xD;
the other side of this projecting wall of the&#xD;
precipice, the' beach was continued, broad and&#xD;
white as before, for more than a league, and was&#xD;
the common way taken by the inhabitants along&#xD;

&#xD;
the coast from one hamlet to the other. But as&#xD;
the projecting clift would have broken off all&#xD;
communication between the two parts of this&#xD;
beach pathway, two small boats had been im-&#xD;
memorially kept there, one on one side and the&#xD;
other on the opposite side, for those who passed&#xD;
that way to row themselves round the spur of&#xD;
-the rock.&#xD;
As the path by which Guilford usually visited&#xD;
the garden of the castle lay around the cliff, he&#xD;
now approached the little skiff;which had painted&#xD;
on its stern, " Castle Vane," it being the property&#xD;
of Lord Vane, he suddenly heard a loud shout-&#xD;
ing of numerous voices in the direction of the&#xD;
hamlet in his rear, and one or two discharges of&#xD;
harquebuses. 'The voices continued ' to ad-&#xD;
vance, and looking back with surprise, and won-&#xD;
dering at the cause, he saw far distant a single&#xD;
man running along the beach at his. fleetest&#xD;
speed. Iis dark form was distinctly relieved&#xD;
against the white, moonlit sand. The next mo-&#xD;
ment, not a hundred and fifty yards behind him,&#xD;
came two others, who seemed in hot pursuit.&#xD;
Guilford had already placed his foot in the boat,&#xD;
and held the oar in his hand ; but he re-&#xD;
mained motionless, watching the advance of the&#xD;
fugitive, who each moment was gained 'upon&#xD;
by his pursuers. He now began to feel an inter-&#xD;
est in him, as every generous mind will instantly&#xD;
take part with the weakest; and this interest was&#xD;
-     Aft lessened whest the pursuers increased to seven&#xD;
iAn,'who shouted:&#xD;
"'The sword of the Lord and of Gideon !&#xD;
Death to the son of Anak.! Slay the son of&#xD;
Beliall",&#xD;
*"They are covenanters in chase of a loyalist,"&#xD;
said Guilford, biting his lip. 1" If he reaches&#xD;
here in good time, I will agree to save him at all&#xD;
risks."&#xD;
At this moment he saw the fugitive stop, as&#xD;
his nearest pursuer was not twenty yards off,&#xD;
turn round, qnd deliberately fire at- him. The&#xD;
man fell, and the fugitive once more bounded on&#xD;
his way. This bold and cool act elevated him&#xD;
not a little in the estimation of so brave a spirit&#xD;
as that of Guilford, and he-watched the approach&#xD;
of the hunted loyalist, as he supposed him to be,&#xD;
with the deepest solicitude. A second pursuer&#xD;
coming too near, shared the fate of 'the first;&#xD;
but a horsetrooper coming at spur-speed on the&#xD;
beach, gained so rapidly on him, that Guilford&#xD;
felt, that unless the man had another shot left,&#xD;
he would be taken. That he had not, Guilford&#xD;
saw very clearly by the almost superhuman&#xD;
&#xD;
efforts now made by the man to escape from the&#xD;
horseman.&#xD;
"I have a pistol !" cried Guilford, with admi-&#xD;
ration. " Teese troopers are our natural foes.&#xD;
Shall I stand here and see a brave man taken,&#xD;
and perhaps slain before my face ? It may be&#xD;
the prince himself for aught I know. I will&#xD;
give him all the aid I can, whosoever he be !"&#xD;
He then pushed the skiff a little out from the&#xD;
beach, and placed the oars so that they could&#xD;
be used instantly, and then hastened to meet the&#xD;
fugitive, who ran heavily, as if he had nearly lost&#xD;
his wind.&#xD;
"Courage, my 'friend !" shouted Guilford.&#xD;
"I have a shot for the trooper ! Run a little&#xD;
further, and there is a boat to escape in."-&#xD;
The sound of the encouraging voice of the&#xD;
young fisherman seemed to; give new spirits to&#xD;
the pursued stranger, who waved his hand, and&#xD;
came forward at a more vigorous pace. the&#xD;
horseman also increased his speed, and when&#xD;
the fugiive had got within twenty fathoms of the&#xD;
boat, the trooper was alongside of him, with his&#xD;
broad claynore sweeping around above his head,&#xD;
ready to descend upon the neck of the royalist,&#xD;
Guilford was not near enough to aid in warding&#xD;
off the blow, which the fugitive could not do,&#xD;
having, as Guilford perceived, no sword, and&#xD;
but one hand ; and the young fisherman brought&#xD;
his huge pistol to bear upon the broad chest of&#xD;
the trooper, and fired it. The man received the&#xD;
ball in his heart, and tumbled from his horse&#xD;
upon the beach, with the sword which he held&#xD;
aloft ready to aim the blow, lying broken under&#xD;
him in the sand.&#xD;
" Gallantly done, young man !" cried the fugi-&#xD;
tive. "You have saved my life."   And -he&#xD;
pressed Guilford's hand to his bosom.&#xD;
" We have not a moment to lose, my lord,"&#xD;
said Guilford. " Quickly, into the boat !"&#xD;
"I need no urging, my brave fellow," an-&#xD;
swered the stranger, stepping into the boat,&#xD;
which Guilford in a few seconds rowed out&#xD;
from the land and around - the rock, behind&#xD;
which he disappeared as two more horsemen&#xD;
came up to the fallen body of their companion.&#xD;
One of, them, with reckless hardihood, spurred -&#xD;
his hore into the sea, and compelled him to&#xD;
swim out, as if his rider were resolved to let no&#xD;
obstacles prevent him from capturing the fugitive.&#xD;
But the weight of the man, who was gigantic in&#xD;
size, and the terror of the animal, after a short&#xD;
distance brought on a terrible struggle between'&#xD;
life and death ; and in vain attempting to ex.&#xD;
&#xD;
tricate himself from the saddle and stirrups, the&#xD;
man sunk with his forse and disappeared for-&#xD;
ever.&#xD;
At this tragical result the other troopers&#xD;
paused ori the shore, and as the cliffpresented&#xD;
an insurmountable barrier to their further pro-&#xD;
gress, the escape of the fugitive was effectually'&#xD;
secured.&#xD;
"They cannot come after us here," said Guil-&#xD;
ford, as he drove the boat against the beach&#xD;
beyond the rock.&#xD;
"And to what brave young man am I in-&#xD;
debted for my safety ?" askedthe stranger, who&#xD;
pressed the hand of the young fisherman with&#xD;
strong emotion.&#xD;
"I am but a fisherman, my lord, who lives in&#xD;
the hamlet from which you came, and by good&#xD;
fortune having an errand this way, was enabled&#xD;
to afford you the assistance I havedone."&#xD;
" And good aid it was, and gallantly well len&#xD;
to me ; for you have as steady a hand and as&#xD;
true an eye with a pistolet as any king's cava-&#xD;
lier of the guards. What is thy name ?-for I&#xD;
would befriend thee, if some day I have it in my&#xD;
power."&#xD;
" Guilford Graham, sir cavalier," answered&#xD;
Guilford, who could see by the dress and bear-&#xD;
ing of the stranger that he svs a man of very&#xD;
different stamp from the Roundheads. As the&#xD;
moonlight shone full upon him, he could see&#xD;
that he was a well-made man, of thirty-seven or&#xD;
eight years, with long, black locks, floating to his&#xD;
neck, his air proud, and his bearing bold and&#xD;
resolute. But his curiosty was awakened to&#xD;
know how he, had lost his right hand. This&#xD;
curiosity was perhaps apparent in his looks, for&#xD;
the stranger said : ,                    *&#xD;
" I suppose you would like to know who I&#xD;
am I You ought to know; but'in these days it&#xD;
is not safe alwaysfor men to carry their appella-&#xD;
tions posted on their'breast-ylates. You say we&#xD;
are safe here. It may be that you are ; but as&#xD;
for me, I am not safe on any foot of England's&#xD;
soil on the Sussex coast. Look you ! Hast thou&#xD;
seen any sail in the offing towards the syn-&#xD;
down 1"-&#xD;
" Methinks, my lord-"  .&#xD;
"Nay, how dost thou know me ?" -&#xD;
"I do not, my lord. I did give thee but the&#xD;
chance title of respect."&#xD;
" Drop, it, lest it be not over safe. Call me&#xD;
captain, and thou wilt have a handle to my name.&#xD;
What didst thou see ?"&#xD;
"Far in the south and west I thought I saw&#xD;
&#xD;
the upper sails of a, brigantine, standing .coast-&#xD;
wise ; but I was too much taken up with my&#xD;
own affairs just then to give it or its course es-&#xD;
pecial heed." -&#xD;
" You shall know enough of me, young man,&#xD;
to know that I am expecting a vessel in this&#xD;
night from the channel to take me off. Pull out&#xD;
a bit from the shore, if thy own business be not&#xD;
too pressing, and let me look about. I shall feel&#xD;
more secure with an acre or two of broad sea-&#xD;
water lying between me and the main. Any&#xD;
moment these troopers may circumvent us by&#xD;
the castle road and pounce upon us."&#xD;
" That is trie. I will row out wfih you a mile&#xD;
or two, and if you see nothing of the-craft you&#xD;
look for, captain, I will land you on such safe&#xD;
part of the coast as you-may name, if it be not&#xD;
so far off that I cannot return hither by mid-&#xD;
night."&#xD;
"An affair of love thou hast on thy hands, I'll&#xD;
be sworn for you," answered the captain, laugh-&#xD;
ing ; " but I will not keep thee long. If I see&#xD;
nothing of the boat I look for in an hour, I will&#xD;
put back with you, and trust to you to find-me a&#xD;
hiding place for another day."&#xD;
Guilford was so captivated by a certain franks&#xD;
chivalrous manner of the stranger, and he seemed&#xD;
to place such unsuspecting confidence in .hlm,&#xD;
that he resolved, even if it should defer his inter-&#xD;
view with: Lady Catharine to another night, to&#xD;
give this night to securing the safety of ; his'new&#xD;
friend. That he was some flying cavalier he'&#xD;
was well convinced in his own mind; and he ran&#xD;
over in his memory the names of several of the&#xD;
most distinguished of whom he had heard as&#xD;
having been banished, or against whom sentence&#xD;
had been declared, with the probability that this&#xD;
stranger might be one of-them.&#xD;
" I will go out with you, sir," he answered,&#xD;
" cheerfully ; and if you do not see your vessel,&#xD;
and your head is in danger on land, I think that&#xD;
I can manage to run you across 4o the.French&#xD;
coast in a fishing smack to morrow night."&#xD;
." Parbleu, mon ami !" exclaimed the captain,&#xD;
with a laugh. " The land of monsieur will burn&#xD;
my feet as badly as the land of John Bull. No,&#xD;
no ; I am safe only on the deck of my own&#xD;
ship."&#xD;
" Then you have a ship, sir ?"&#xD;
" Ay, have I, and a better keel cuts not the&#xD;
waters of the channel. It is she that I am wait-&#xD;
ing for. , New we are clear from the shore again&#xD;
I can breathe more freely. Pull out steadily a'&#xD;
mile or so, and then we will look about us."&#xD;

CH A PTER VIII.&#xD;
A STARTLING ADVENTURE.&#xD;
&#xD;
GULFORD rowed out from the beach straight&#xD;
into the channel. As they got far enough from&#xD;
the shore- to look round on the other side of the&#xD;
rock, they saw the troopers retiring, bearing off&#xD;
the dead bodies of their.comrades who had fallen&#xD;
in the pursuit.&#xD;
"Did you ever kill a man before ?" asked the&#xD;
captain of Guilford, who had drawn his attention&#xD;
to the scene on shore.&#xD;
"'No, sir."&#xD;
"You could hardly do so in a better cause.&#xD;
If you had not shot that fellow, he would have&#xD;
cloven me to the earth: I was never harder beset&#xD;
in my life; and yet I-have not always passed my&#xD;
4oys in a lady's boudoir." -&#xD;
"One would not think so, sir, to see you. I&#xD;
dare say you Iost your hand in some famous&#xD;
battle !"&#xD;
The brow of the stranger, naturally black,&#xD;
became suddenly dark as night. He was silent&#xD;
for a few moments, and then answered in tones&#xD;
that thrilled the very heart's blood of the young&#xD;
fisherman:&#xD;
"No, sir-on the scaffold 1"&#xD;
"On the scaffold 1" repeated Guilford, with a&#xD;
start and a look that betrayed his surprise ; and&#xD;
in his excitement he'ceased rowing and regarded&#xD;
the stranger with a new and strange interest. :&#xD;
"Do not cease to row, my young friend. I&#xD;
&#xD;
would gain a good sea-berth. Your eyes are&#xD;
sharp. Look, and tell me what you see in the&#xD;
south. I fancied*I caught a flash of fire in that&#xD;
quarter, just west of the moon's path."-&#xD;
" So did I, sir.' There are three lights-burn-&#xD;
ing, one above another-. They are small, but I&#xD;
see them distinctly."&#xD;
"And so do I," answered the captain,spng-&#xD;
ing to his feet, and speaking with animatedfjoy.&#xD;
"That is my boat. It was to row in from the&#xD;
ship, which.was to remain in tnid-channel, and&#xD;
every ten minutes, as she pulled 'towards the-&#xD;
little port of Blithelmstone, was todisplay three&#xD;
lanterns upon an oar. By being out here half a&#xD;
league from land I shall save them the trouble&#xD;
of going farther i,'and yon the time'-which I&#xD;
know you are generously giving me-froin the&#xD;
trysting tree. I know-it is unfair to rob a lover&#xD;
of one moment of such heavenly moonlight as&#xD;
this."&#xD;
"Nay, sir cavalier," answered Guilford,:who:&#xD;
each moment felt more drawn out to like the&#xD;
man whose life he had saved, and to confide in&#xD;
him; "it needs but little lightfor a lover to taka&#xD;
his last adieuof his lady love."&#xD;
" What I-Is it so?  It must be, from, thy&#xD;
tones, and the tremor of thy lip. What, a quar-&#xD;
rel?"                             °&#xD;
"No, my lord. Do not ask me more."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE YOUNG:&#xD;
&#xD;
" Nay, but thy happiness shall be in my keep-&#xD;
ing. Thou shalt tell me thy-tale on board my&#xD;
ship. It may be I can serve thee where thou&#xD;
little thinkest."&#xD;
" Thanks, captain ; but no one can aid me. It&#xD;
is settled without charge."&#xD;
" I will judge of that when I have made thee&#xD;
tell me thy love story., See ! there shine the&#xD;
lights again nearer. The rogues are pulling in&#xD;
towards the land, little guessing their master is&#xD;
so near' them. If they had been a-land two&#xD;
hours earlier, I should not have been exposed to&#xD;
be hunted- like a fox as I was. Pull a little&#xD;
across the course of the boat, so that we can&#xD;
meet her."                            ,&#xD;
Guilford could now plainly see, not a quarter&#xD;
of a mile off, a black, four-oared barge, pulling&#xD;
steadily in towards the land. No lights were'&#xD;
now visible on board, but every few minutes&#xD;
three round, swinging lanterns had been dis-&#xD;
played for a moment and then removed. As the'&#xD;
boats drew near each other, the barge was stopped&#xD;
suddenly, and there was distinctly heard the&#xD;
clicking of steel against flint.&#xD;
"My merry men are regular devils to be on&#xD;
the alert," said the captain. " They would ham-&#xD;
mer their flints if they saw a-pair of gulls sailing&#xD;
near on a rotten spar.- They willchallenge us,&#xD;
and if we are not quick to give a satisfactory&#xD;
response, they will give us, without shrive, or&#xD;
shrift, a couple of pounds of harquebus balls in&#xD;
our ribs,"&#xD;
Scarcely had the stranger spoken, than there&#xD;
came sternly across the water the sonorous hail:&#xD;
a"What boat is there ?"  ...&#xD;
"W        ahThe prince I" responded the cavalier, in a&#xD;
loud voice.&#xD;
At this the crew of the other boat gave a&#xD;
hearty British huzza; and the oars falling into&#xD;
the water, the barge came bounding across the&#xD;
intervening space of water like an arrow. -The&#xD;
next moment the two boats were side by side&#xD;
and stationary. -Guilford had been struck with&#xD;
amazementwhen. he heard the stranger's answer;&#xD;
and, believing, that it was indeed the prince in&#xD;
person, thioughihe had believed him to be a more&#xD;
youthful. - oking man, he sprang forward to kiss&#xD;
his hand rid declare his devotion to hini even in&#xD;
his exile.&#xD;
"Nay, my brave friend;" said the stranger,&#xD;
raising him up, "I-am not the prince but I-wish&#xD;
I were; for thy sake and his own; for I fear me&#xD;
he has not the good fortune to be go well out of&#xD;
England as I am. -The answer I gave is but&#xD;
&#xD;
FISHERMAN.                             81&#xD;
the name of my ship, and the sign 9f my presence&#xD;
to my men.- I .am glad to meet you again, my&#xD;
trusty hearts I" he now said, turning to -the crew ;&#xD;
and at the same time he exchanged friendly salu-&#xD;
tations with a young officer who commanded&#xD;
the barge, and who seemed exceedingly happy&#xD;
to see him.&#xD;
".And where is the ship, Edward ?" he asked&#xD;
of him.                    . -"&#xD;
To the south-west about four iniles."&#xD;
"Are all well on board?"&#xD;
"All, my lord."&#xD;
"And any news? You have been late."&#xD;
" We would have been in earlier, but a yacht&#xD;
was hovering about us till night, and-kept us&#xD;
from advancing ; and at length it became so&#xD;
close a watcher that the count.fired a gun,;and&#xD;
brought her to, and captured her. He feared&#xD;
they would run in and report the ship."&#xD;
" He did right. Whose yacht was it ?"&#xD;
The answer was spoken in so low a tone that&#xD;
Guilford did not hear it; for the young officer&#xD;
seemed to speak with constraint-before him&#xD;
" Ah, do not fear my friend here, Edward. I&#xD;
owe mny life to his courage. You: must know, I&#xD;
was seated in the village inn, quietly waiting for&#xD;
the night, after having by a miracle got, away&#xD;
from - London, vhen all at once there tap-room&#xD;
was filled by as truculent a set of Cromwell's&#xD;
worthies as you ever chanced to' meet with,&#xD;
Well, I had to put a bold face on theta matter,&#xD;
and pretended to take no notice of them. s po0&#xD;
found they were despatched to guard the coas&#xD;
to prevent Prince Charles from' getting out. of&#xD;
England; for Olivethas sent guards from Land's&#xD;
End to Newcastle, to keep him within the island;&#xD;
but Heaven grant him a safe escape fromis&#xD;
toils and a trimph over all his enemies !" ,&#xD;
"Amen 1" said Guilford, in so hearty a tone,&#xD;
that the youthful seaman who had been called&#xD;
Edward graspet him by the hand, and =said,&#xD;
enthusiastically&#xD;
" Whoever you are, you are my friend, since&#xD;
you pity the prince."&#xD;
Guilford returned the pressure with delight,&#xD;
and the captain resumed :&#xD;
"My wits were now set to work to find some&#xD;
way of getting out of the inn without attracting&#xD;
the particular notice of these suspicious RBund.;&#xD;
heads. But the first movement I made to rise&#xD;
to settle my bill and leave was observed by two&#xD;
of them;, who came near and said, impertinently&#xD;
and in their sanctimonious whine:&#xD;
"'Brother, thou needest not depart. Thto.&#xD;

"By this I knew hey meant Oliver their inas-&#xD;
S ter, andI swoireziternally that I would have my&#xD;
tongue cut ont'}efore I would lift a cup to my&#xD;
lips in his hOgr. So I resolved, before I drew&#xD;
the noti   more of them upon me, that I would&#xD;
bolt 'ee;and trust to my good fortune ; for&#xD;
if they  re by chance to discover who I was, I&#xD;
knew : my fate was sealed. So, without more&#xD;
ado,'I seized a settle,and swinging it broadly,&#xD;
knocked my two civil friends to the flooi-, and&#xD;
clearing myway, I gained the outside of the&#xD;
hostel, aid then-ran for it. It was some seconds&#xD;
before-they fully understood the matter who were&#xD;
outside; but no sooner did the idea take them&#xD;
that I was not running for a wager, but for my&#xD;
head, than they were not backward in making&#xD;
sail after me. Instinctively i made for the sea-&#xD;
side, where I hoped to see my boat, for it wa&#xD;
the hout I looked for her appearance to take mp&#xD;
off to my ship. But no boat was to be seen, and&#xD;
I followed the beach at life-speed, followed by&#xD;
ny pursuers,who gave race after me like a pack&#xD;
of hounds. I shot two of them as they came&#xD;
after me; but a third, who was mounted, would,&#xD;
haven't me down but for this brave fellow, who&#xD;
knocked' him out of his saddle with a pistolet&#xD;
shot, and then got me off in his boat, which was&#xD;
close athanai. So you see I have had a narrow&#xD;
.. esd s kand if you and my merry men love me,&#xD;
Edward, you will think much of this bold youth,&#xD;
Guilford Graham."&#xD;
"Weare friends from this hour," answered&#xD;
the elg  yqung sailor, whom Gdilford thought&#xD;
handsome~ enough to be a woman, and laying&#xD;
his hand affectionately upon hid shoulder.&#xD;
-"We ill now pull- to the ship," said the cap-&#xD;
tain; "but, my brave fisherman, wilt thou not&#xD;
go on board with me ? - I wish to show thee my&#xD;
brain craft and my true men all,-every soul of&#xD;
whom will be thy friend for what thou hast.done&#xD;
to-night: Come, do not hesitate. I will have&#xD;
thee and thy boat put adrift by sunrise, if thou&#xD;
likest, near enough to the coast for thee to row&#xD;
in in half an hour."&#xD;
" I will go on board, if coming nearer the&#xD;
shore -of England at dawn will not put thee in&#xD;
peril oil my account."&#xD;
" Not a bit; my good friend; I care not, when&#xD;
I am on board, how near I run in and snap my&#xD;
fingers at Cromwell's clumsy war ships. Give&#xD;
way, my men ; we will take the boat, to which I&#xD;
inipart owe my safety, in tow."&#xD;
&#xD;
Almost in opposition to his own real wishes,&#xD;
Guilford found himself consenting to visit the&#xD;
ship. The captain had fascinated him, and he&#xD;
felt that he should be content to unite his fortunes&#xD;
with his, after he should have taken farewell of&#xD;
Lady Catharine. Indeed, from the fitt, when&#xD;
the stranger hinted' mechanically that 'he had a&#xD;
ship, a wish was born in "Guilford's heart to sail&#xD;
with him and win a name upon the'seas. It was&#xD;
mainly under the impulse of this scarcely-formed&#xD;
idea that he yielded to the invitation to go on&#xD;
board.&#xD;
"I will, at least, see for myself," he said with-&#xD;
in himself, musingly ; "and if Ifind that here is a&#xD;
career open before me for honor and fame, I will&#xD;
embrace it, if this brave captain will take me&#xD;
into his service."&#xD;
In half an hour after' he had consented to be&#xD;
taken on board the ship, she was seen looming&#xD;
up about a mile distant, darkly and ipdistinct,&#xD;
like a huge floating castle with gray towers., A&#xD;
single blue light was placed over the quarter as&#xD;
a guide to the boat, in order that it might not&#xD;
mistake another vessel for it.&#xD;
"She is' a very large vessel, sir," remarked&#xD;
Guilford, as she grew larger and larger'on the&#xD;
vision of his eye' as they approached the place&#xD;
where she majestically rose and fell upon the&#xD;
long swells of the quiet sea."&#xD;
"Yes -'we have not less than three hundred&#xD;
men on board, and some thirty cannons at her-&#xD;
sides, besides two swivels in each top."&#xD;
" It must be a very fine thing to command'so&#xD;
brave a ship as that, sir captain."&#xD;
" That is as a person's- aibiti*n may meusuro.&#xD;
Some particular friends oft'itie, young man,&#xD;
would hardly be content with less than a channel&#xD;
fleet."&#xD;
" I am sure I should consider my fortune made'&#xD;
for life, sir, to command a single ship half the size&#xD;
of this. How grandly she towers upward, like&#xD;
Castle Vat e seen from the beach 1"&#xD;
"Castle Vane ?-that is Lord Charles Vane's&#xD;
residene,'and was near where we embarked ?"&#xD;
"The very castle, sir, that was on the cliff."&#xD;
"So I supposed.   Is Lord Vane at hOme,&#xD;
canst say'?"&#xD;
" The young lord is, sir captain."'&#xD;
"Ay-is he ? A young man that I do not,&#xD;
much fancy."&#xD;
"Nor I,ny lord," answered Guilford, speak-&#xD;
ing without reflection from the feelingof fthe&#xD;
moment.&#xD;
"Ha! has he crossed thy path, then, young&#xD;
man?"&#xD;

" She is very fair, my lord captain.",   He feltithat he was mad longer, to think of her.&#xD;
"Thou hast seen her, then'?"             He now saw more vividly than ever his rashnpss&#xD;
" Yes, my lord," answered Guilford, blushing, and folly.  He, the poor fisher, to cope ,with&#xD;
and both pleased and annoyed at having Lady knights, nobles, and princes! .,He, felt, like&#xD;
Catharine the subject ofieonversation. To him dropping into the deep, deep sea, and putting&#xD;

thoughts, and the idea of whom he could share his ambitious madness, his despair, and all the&#xD;
with no one.                               future of misery which he saw before him on&#xD;

that officer, handing him a book. "You will&#xD;
find in it that last-iigit we brought to a yacht,&#xD;
and have detained the parties, one of whom is a&#xD;
lady, and at the present time occupies the inner&#xD;
state-room."&#xD;
"Yes, yes, Edward said something to me&#xD;
about it," answered the captain; "but as I 'am&#xD;
now on board, there can be no harm in letting&#xD;
them depart. Where is the yacht 7"&#xD;
"It is alongside, my lord."&#xD;
" How many persons did it contain i"&#xD;
"Seven. A gentleman and young lady, one&#xD;
passenger, and a crew of four men."&#xD;
"Bring- the gentleman before me."&#xD;
"My lord, shall I leave ?" asked Guilford,&#xD;
who saw that this was to-be a private interview.&#xD;
"No; remain where you are, my friend, I&#xD;
want to talk with you by-and-by."-&#xD;
The next moment the lieutenant returned,&#xD;
conducting Lord Rudolph Vane into the state-&#xD;
cabin. His face was pale, and his eye had a&#xD;
tremulous light of fear in it. Guilford instantly&#xD;
recognized him, but not caring to be recognized&#xD;
ia return, he withdrew into the shadow of one&#xD;
of the gilded columns that supported the- deck,&#xD;
overhead. - But theleyes of Lord Rudolph were&#xD;
fixed only on the dark, noble, commanding fa e&#xD;

",Lord Rudolph Vane, of castle Vane," an-&#xD;
swered' thp-young man, haughtily; for, finding-&#xD;
that:no danger was to be apprehended, his na-&#xD;
tive insolence and audacity returned.&#xD;
-" Ah, my lord, indeed i I have heard of you,"&#xD;
said-the captain, with a darkening brow; " and&#xD;
what I have heard gives your honor not over&#xD;
much credit.",&#xD;
"Do you insult me, sir I" demanded Rudolph,&#xD;
fiercely.&#xD;
"Be- calm, my lord. Your ire here will do&#xD;
you no good. You are in my hands, and if you&#xD;
knew 'who I am, you would expect the next&#xD;
moment oisear me give the order to have you&#xD;
hanged at my fore-yard-arm."&#xD;
Lord Rudolph shuddered. His face became&#xD;
as pale as marble.4&#xD;
"Who---who are youI What have you against&#xD;

spy, as no doubt you were, captured you. My&#xD;
first order, before hearing your name, was for.&#xD;
your release, for anything you can now report&#xD;
on land can do us no harm; for cre twelve hours,&#xD;
we shall be - sailing many leagues from here.&#xD;
But since I learn who you are, I wish to show&#xD;
you that I ani too far above you to crush such a&#xD;
reptile. Deeply as you-have wronged me-base&#xD;
as you are-recreant as you have proved to your&#xD;
oath as a noble, you are too far beneath my.&#xD;
contempt to come within the notice of my ven-&#xD;
geance.&#xD;
"Who are you ?" demanded Rudolph, with&#xD;
his eyes red with rage and alarm.&#xD;
"I am the Earl of Villiers," answered the&#xD;
captain, in a voice of thunder.&#xD;
Instantly Lord Rudolph sunk upon his knees,&#xD;
like a man who has been smitten down by some&#xD;
irresistible stroke.'&#xD;
"Wellymay you tremble, caitiff! Ay, I am&#xD;
that nobleman-that friend of the king, who, by&#xD;
your treachery, was brought to the scaffold, and&#xD;
-b'ot nry right hand! Look ye ?" and the, cap-&#xD;
tain-held up before the eyes of the terror-stricken&#xD;
ung-lord,-the- stuii  of his wrist. " Under&#xD;
mask of courting ,mny daughter, Lady Jane, you&#xD;
wormed yourself into a loyalnoble's house;crept&#xD;
like a serpent into the sacred circle of my do-&#xD;
mestic hearth, crouched like a toad in the corner&#xD;
of my library and council rooms till you learned'&#xD;
that I Was leader of a conspiracy to bring Crom-&#xD;
well's head to the block. Then, charged with&#xD;
the news, tho.- didst mock any daughter's'love&#xD;
and leave her, andepour into the protector's'ear&#xD;
all thy treacherous intelligence. For this tihou&#xD;
.wert rewarded with my fair estate as the hire Far&#xD;

done, and for love of my daughter,, with iwho&#xD;
she studied her books at common tutelage, -my'&#xD;

I, with my child, was exiled beyond sea. Well&#xD;
mayest thou crouch and moan. -There is. no-&#xD;
man on the round earth into whose hands you&#xD;
should so much-fear to fall as into mine."&#xD;
The wretch remained upon his knees, looking_&#xD;
the very picture of fear' and abjectness. The&#xD;
dread of theeath which he felt he richly meriteild&#xD;
was stamped upon his clammy brow. lH4lips-&#xD;
moved, as if trying to form words ta"ask for'&#xD;
mercy, yet no sound came from them, aa If &#xD;
felt that all petitions would be in vain'.&#xD;

false and traitorous noble? Shall I nQt hang,&#xD;
thee?"&#xD;
" For umy sister's sake !" he gasped, as if he&#xD;
had.caught a faint ray of hope.,&#xD;
"1Thy sister ! Ah, yes ; for her sake I would&#xD;
do much, for I owe to her tears and eloquence&#xD;
with the stern, flinty Cromwell, my head. What&#xD;
of-her ?"&#xD;
"She is here ! Let her speak for me."&#xD;
"By the rood, she may speak for thy life and&#xD;
gain it ; but thou shalt lose thy right hand this&#xD;
night, as surely as there is justice on earth."&#xD;
"Mercy ! mercy-my lord !"&#xD;
" Ho there ! Lieutenant St. Clair ! Call the&#xD;
men together to execution."&#xD;
-" 0, you are not going to kill me !"&#xD;
"If thy sister pleads not for thy life, it is not&#xD;
worth a mavaredi to thee ; but thy right hand&#xD;
shall be cut off. I have sworn it."&#xD;
With a shriek, the craven noble fell down in&#xD;
a swoon his full length upon the floor.&#xD;
A voice from the inner cabin was now heard&#xD;
in earnest implorations. Guilford, who had al-&#xD;
ready divined that Lady Catharine was the&#xD;
female who had been .captured with the yacht,&#xD;
no*.recognised the tones, and he darted impul-&#xD;
sively towards the door; but the sentry presented&#xD;
his cutlass, and held him back. He then ad-&#xD;
vanced towards the earl, and said with mueh&#xD;
excitement&#xD;
"It is the Lady Catharine Vane, my lord-it&#xD;
is his sister.".&#xD;
"I will at once speak with her," he answered,&#xD;
and approached the door, which he unlocked.&#xD;
The maiden stood before it, with her toilette&#xD;
.considerably dishevelled, her rich hair freely,&#xD;
floating lpon her shoulders, and her beauty iit&#xD;
creased b' the excitement of her feelings,,&#xD;
"Lady Catharine Vane, I am not your jailer,&#xD;
but your debtor," said the earl; courteously.&#xD;
"Why are we detained prisoners ? What is&#xD;
this I have overheard about the execution of my&#xD;
brother?" she,-asked, earnestly.&#xD;
"Lord Rudolph is notr to be executed if you&#xD;
ask his life; but he is nevertheless doomed to a&#xD;
punishment   at no mediation can save him&#xD;
from. In      lady, you behold Lord Villiers.&#xD;
This name lesnough to show you what I owe&#xD;
to your generns interposition, and what"I owe&#xD;
to your.brother. Here let me thank you, both&#xD;
for my daughter  and for myself, for the life&#xD;
which you were instrumental in saving from the&#xD;
block."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Thensspare my bother ! 0, he is already&#xD;
dad !" fhe exe ined, on discovering him upop&#xD;
the cabin floo;about being raised up and re-&#xD;
vived by some'attendants,&#xD;
"lay, it is only a swoon."&#xD;
"0, spare his life, my noble lord 1"&#xD;
I will do so, for your sake. And he el4l&#xD;
understand that to you alone he owes it,'&#xD;
At this moment, in looking around hrher&#xD;
eyes fell on Guilford, who was standing near,&#xD;
reserved and diffident, listening to what-was said.&#xD;
She no sooner beheld him, than she seemed to&#xD;
forget everything else, everybody about her; for,&#xD;
running towards him,) she caught hii by both&#xD;
hands, and exclaimed, with the artless delight of&#xD;
a child which amid strangers suddenly discovers&#xD;
a familiar face:&#xD;
" You here, Guilford ? Heaven be praised 1"&#xD;
The earl, who saw the act, and observed the&#xD;
expression of pure delight and frankness 'upon&#xD;
her beautiful face, was not a little surprised;&#xD;
and when he saw 'this pleasure reflected from&#xD;
the handsome features of the young fish roman '&#xD;
he was hot a little perplexed.&#xD;
"Do not fear; Lady Kate, you ae safe, and in&#xD;
the hands of a n bleu'gbrtle a,' Ajd niilford,&#xD;
enc6uragingly.&#xD;
"I hope you are tot here a prisoner i-that&#xD;
you are not in any danger?"&#xD;
"Be assured, tady Catharine," said the earl,&#xD;
smiling, " that there is not at this mnient more&#xD;
honored person in this ship than this young&#xD;
man, who, I am pleased to see, is also known to&#xD;
you; to him I owe my life, He brought me off&#xD;
to my ship in his boat, and without'his gallalt&#xD;
aid I should now no longer be alive."   *&#xD;
Thanks-thanks! I am so glad you hae&#xD;
^   ablesto serve the earl. Ah, Guilfordtoy&#xD;
brother has done him great wrong. Bttmy&#xD;
lord, I beseech thee, forgive him."&#xD;
"Plead for me, Catharine !" suddenly caled&#xD;
out the young noble, who had been brought to&#xD;
his senses. "Plead for me."&#xD;
" She has done so successfully, my lord," an-&#xD;
swered the earl, coldly. "She has gained thy&#xD;
life for thee."&#xD;
"But my hand! You will not cirt offmy&#xD;
hand I"&#xD;
' "Were an angel to descend from the blue&#xD;
skies and ask me to spare thy hand, Iwould&#xD;
not do it. It lsaneed and rip justice that thou&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;
LOnD nDOLPH'S PUNISHMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
'Tn Lady Kate sat upon the ottoman where&#xD;
ho had left her with her hands pressed to her&#xD;
eyes, and her face buried in the cushions. She&#xD;
saw that the earl was inexorable ; and although&#xD;
her brother had never been otherwise than hos-'&#xD;
tile towards her ever sinceshe had pleaded so&#xD;
s   c   ly for the Earl of Vilhiers, yet she&#xD;
ou     ;forget that he was her brother; and,&#xD;
deserved nothing at her hands, yet&#xD;
she fetthat she ought to use all her influence&#xD;
bizfree him from the disgraceful maiming to&#xD;
=haehhe was-about to be subjected.&#xD;
But I can do-no more," she said ; "his fate&#xD;
sealed. "I saw by the earl's eye as he left&#xD;
Ah, poor, erring Rudolph; thou cast&#xD;
blaine only thyself ! Horrid! that rolling drum&#xD;
mus,_ be the signal for the execution of the in-&#xD;
fle   . earl's command !"&#xD;
*     When, the earl returned from the state-room&#xD;
where he had left.the tearful maiden, he found&#xD;
Lord Rudolph, who had recognized Guilford,&#xD;
and with surprise seen that he was regarded&#xD;
with favor, pleading, with the young fisherman&#xD;
to intercede for him.&#xD;
"Y6u are not a prisoner. I know you can&#xD;
forgive me, for you are naturally generous, I&#xD;
have heard my sister say. Speak a word for&#xD;
me. I cannot endure the loss oT my hand! For&#xD;
my sister's sake, do plead for me!"&#xD;
"I have no power, my lord," answered Guil-&#xD;
ford, who cold not conceal his contempt for&#xD;
his cowardly-conduct at a time when i truly&#xD;
brave a -    zd meet Its fate with proud in-&#xD;
&#xD;
to&#xD;
&#xD;
difference. But there was nothing truly great&#xD;
about Lord Rudolph. He could be haughty&#xD;
and cruel in possession.of power, but in suffer-&#xD;
ing he showedin its true colors all the weakness&#xD;
and insignificance of his character.&#xD;
" Will no one intercede for me ?" he cried in&#xD;
despair, seeing Guilford turn away, for he well&#xD;
knew that if Lady Kate could not prevail, no&#xD;
wold he could utter would be regarded.&#xD;
"Is all ready ?" quietly demanded the earl of&#xD;
the officer who had superintended the prepara-&#xD;
tions for the execution of the sentence.&#xD;
"All ready, my lord," answered the officer.&#xD;
Conduct Lord Vane- to the deck, unless he&#xD;
will walk of himself."&#xD;
"Is there no mercy with thee . screamed the,&#xD;
young nobleman.&#xD;
"yThou mightest as well talk to the &amp;amp;xe that&#xD;
is to sever thy'hand. Proceed with: hin, as te&#xD;
is disposed to linger. Nay, do not handle him&#xD;
roughly, for he is noblee birth.",&#xD;
The young lord was then led to the deck. -e&#xD;
was borne along rather than went by his own&#xD;
will. The scene was terribly imposing. .In the&#xD;
centre of the ship just, abaft the capstan, was&#xD;
placed a block. By ii stood four n n. One of&#xD;
them held a glittering battle-axe  his hand;&#xD;
another a brazen basin; the third and fourth&#xD;
lanterns. A little in the advance stood the chi-&#xD;
rurgeon of the ship, with his instruments and&#xD;
bandages, added to which was a sething hot&#xD;
iron, for stopping the flow of the blood. The&#xD;
crew stood around, -seven and eight deep, their&#xD;

&#xD;
bearded faces lighted up byth&#xD;
hung in the rigging. Farther&#xD;
cers, with their swords in their,&#xD;
When Lord Rudolph gazed o&#xD;
well calculated to appal his ne&#xD;
~teranfee to an audible groan.&#xD;
"'Take him 'in hand,. execute&#xD;

him, "is to undergo a just punit&#xD;

At this there was a general m&#xD;

CHAPTER. XI.&#xD;
&#xD;
TflI TURN TO CASTLE VANE.&#xD;
&#xD;
'Tma interview with which the last chapter&#xD;
closedd having thugs happily terminated, the earl,&#xD;
after complimenting Guilford on his spirit, pro-&#xD;
posed to him, if nothing better offered, to take&#xD;
service with him in his ship.&#xD;
"We shall not always be wanderers over the-&#xD;
sea, my friend," he said ; "the prince will one&#xD;
day gain hisihrone, and then we shall be at the&#xD;
top. As for Lady Catharine's heart, you maybe&#xD;
sure that it is in the right place ; and I have a&#xD;
higher regard for you'than before, since I fid'&#xD;
you possess qualities. to win the attachment of-&#xD;
so lovely a lady, who, in the brightness of your,&#xD;
character, can discover no obscurity of birth..&#xD;
Now I have one favor to ask of you," added the&#xD;
earl,- " and trat i5 that you will take command&#xD;
of the yacht and convey Lord Rudolph and'&#xD;
fair sister safely back to Castle Vane: He'"&#xD;
of course,- be something of an invalid, and mnd&#xD;
be. tenderly; eared for. The person who ws&#xD;
taken with him in the yacht, is a'spy of Crom-&#xD;
well's and I shall take care of him'here. If at&#xD;
any time you wish to join my fortunes, you will&#xD;
hear,of me, if you 'Will run over in your boat to&#xD;
the French coast, and land on the island of Al-&#xD;

"4xways knowmy term of absence- -whdn  in&#xD;
hway,' and and line left there for me will be&#xD;
&#xD;
faithfully given into my possession when I put&#xD;
in there."&#xD;
Guilford thanked the earl for his kindness, and -&#xD;
answered that he thought he should very soon&#xD;
be conpe'lled to take him at his word and seek&#xD;
service with him.&#xD;
"Thou shalt be welcome, and although I can&#xD;
do but tle for thee under my present fortunes;&#xD;
sote 'd ,hen I rise, you will rise  th me."&#xD;
noble earl,_I fear," safGuilford,&#xD;
I shall hardly ever rise sa'hlgh as&#xD;

"Courage,     brave youth. In thede top-&#xD;

" This conversation took place in the other cab-&#xD;

ported that the yaclt was alongsid, and her&#xD;
crew on board and all was ready for her depar.&#xD;

AOw&#xD;
Guilford then took a grateful leave of the for-&#xD;
midable Red Hand, in whose dry presence he&#xD;
could scarcely realize himself to have been, and&#xD;
descended into the yacht. The snrlight shone&#xD;
brightly upon its low deck, on wich, stretched&#xD;
upon a cot, he saw the prostrate form of Lord&#xD;
Rudolph, looking ghastly p.   the face. He&#xD;
advanced towards him, and it- kindly :&#xD;
"I hope, my lord, you do not -suffer a great&#xD;
deal of pain ?"&#xD;
"Pain ! Iendure infernal torments. Who are&#xD;
you ? I see, now. What do you want in my&#xD;
yacht ?"&#xD;
"I am prpered by Lord Villiers to take charge&#xD;
ft, and see you safely to Castle Vane, as he&#xD;
can spare none of his men."&#xD;
"Where is Tennett I"&#xD;
" Whomy lord?"&#xD;
" The gentleman who came with me."&#xD;
"I heard the- earl say that as he was a spy of&#xD;
Cromwell's, he should put him in irons. My&#xD;
lord, I have no desire to undertake this duty,&#xD;
but it is the earl's command. I am truly sorry&#xD;
for your misfortune, and will see you to Castle&#xD;
Vane with all tenderness."&#xD;
" And Lady Kate ?"&#xD;
The answer to this interrogation was prevent-&#xD;
ed by the appearance of Red Hand, conducting&#xD;
the noble girl to the yacht. Guilford sprang for.&#xD;
ward to receive her and leadher to a seat in the&#xD;
stern; but she stopped short of it, and bent over&#xD;
her brother with affectionate solicitude.&#xD;
"Now, my noble young friend," said Lord&#xD;
Villiers "I need not tell you what a valuable&#xD;
freight entrust to your charge.      and&#xD;
remember " he added, in an unde       der-&#xD;
ney Isle and the inn, if you hami       y&#xD;
poor services. And for you, Lord Rudolph, I&#xD;
wish you a better heart and more true nobility.&#xD;
I have given you a daily r   rance of megso&#xD;
I will not ask you to bear m  wIiind. Adieu,&#xD;
fair Lady Catharine. What I have witnes&#xD;
and learned of the true nobility of yo ,&#xD;
ter to-night, has caused me to respect you&#xD;
of the rarest jewels among women. You have&#xD;
not," he added to her ear, "lightly bestowed&#xD;
your heart. Believe me, this brave y6uth will&#xD;
yet causehisname to fill a brilliant page in Eng.&#xD;
land's history."&#xD;
"I feel it, my lord. He is all that's good, and&#xD;
noble, and tr'ue." a&#xD;
Love and ,cherish him, for women do notl&#xD;
alway. me to love. I hope, one of these&#xD;
days,           u happiness. 4Farewell; it i&#xD;

&#xD;
but tw'oleagues to yourfather's castle. Commend&#xD;
me to him; but do not from me excuse my pun-&#xD;
ishment of his son, for I have performed but a&#xD;
stern and painful duty."&#xD;
" I know it, my lord," she answered, sadly.&#xD;
He pressed her hand to his lips, and left the&#xD;
deck of the yacht for his own lofty ship.&#xD;
The next moment the little vessel was cast off&#xD;
from the huge side of the channel cruiser, and&#xD;
-taking the helm, Guilford gave orders to the&#xD;
crew to trim the sails, and with a light, but fa-&#xD;
vorable breeze, he lay the course of the yacht for&#xD;
the main. The ship at the same time squared&#xD;
herenormous yards, andher head swinging round&#xD;
westward, she steered on that track till Guillord&#xD;
could see her no longer. The yacht, in the&#xD;
meanwhile, bounded lightly along on her land.-&#xD;
ward track, and clearer and higher the cliff with&#xD;
its castle rose before him. The lights of the&#xD;
little fishing village at its base appeared one after&#xD;
the other ; and from one of the towers one light,&#xD;
brighter than the rest, shone like the lantern of a&#xD;
Pharos.&#xD;
"That is -my father's room, Guilford," said&#xD;
Lady Kate, seeing that he was regarding it.&#xD;
" Doubtlesshe is seated there at his books, for he&#xD;
has the name of being a great scholar, thou hast&#xD;
heard."                  4&#xD;
" Perhaps it is to guide thee back."&#xD;
"Nay, he nor no one is aware that I have been&#xD;
on the sea the last twelve hours. You recollect,&#xD;
Guilford, that my getting into your boat was&#xD;
only the whim of the moment !aand after my&#xD;
brother so strangely took possession of me,.I had&#xD;
no chance of return. Perhaps my father supposes&#xD;
that I am in my room; for I am so much accus-&#xD;
tomed to rove about for hours, that unless I am&#xD;
particularly wanted, it is not known whether I&#xD;
am in the castle or abroad."&#xD;
" I hope you will not have been missed."&#xD;
" Catharine," said Lord Rudolph in a queru-&#xD;
lous voice.&#xD;
" What, brother Rudolph?" she answered, has-&#xD;
tening to his side. "You hage slept well."&#xD;
"I wish to exact an oath from- you. I see we&#xD;
are near the castle. Swear to me, by your hopes&#xD;
of heaven that you will never reveal to my father&#xD;
nor any otherliving being the disgrace Ihave to-&#xD;
night suffered !".&#xD;
" I will not reveal it, brother, if you desire the&#xD;
secret to be kept."&#xD;
" Desire it to be kept ! It must be kept a&#xD;
close secret! If you do not blab- it, and this&#xD;
fishing friend of yours can be forced to be so.&#xD;
&#xD;
1 tN.&#xD;
&#xD;
cret, I will manage to hide from my friends the&#xD;
loss of my hand. I cold never endure the&#xD;
scornful laugh, the consciousness of a mutilation&#xD;
so degrading.".'&#xD;
"But it must be known, brother."&#xD;
"It is known only to the crew of this infernal&#xD;
pirate, not one of whom will ever dare land in&#xD;
England. If you keep the secret, and this fellow&#xD;
can be made to do it--"&#xD;
" Guilford Graham is a person who can be&#xD;
trusted, brother," she said with some earnestness.&#xD;
"So you think. He has fascinated you, girl,&#xD;
by some vile spell. Call him to me. Nay, I&#xD;
will not speak to him, but will leave it to you to&#xD;
exact silence from him."&#xD;
"I will promise it for him. But you forget&#xD;
the four men, your crew."&#xD;
" They will not breathe it.' They are the min-&#xD;
ions of my will. Go and see what this Graham&#xD;
answers."&#xD;
In a frame of mind far from welcome, Lord&#xD;
Rudolph lay upon his couch; for his pride strug-&#xD;
gling with a fierce sentiment of hatred and&#xD;
craven fear, and mingling with some little de-&#xD;
gree of remorse, kept up a fearful tempest of&#xD;
passion in his soul.  Lady Catharine left him&#xD;
on her message to Guilford, a prey to emotions of&#xD;
perfect torture. However, by an effort stronger&#xD;
than 'was his wont, he checked their sway, and&#xD;
awaited, coolly as he might, the answer of Guil&#xD;
ford.&#xD;
" He says he has no desire to report it," she&#xD;
answered, after going to the helm where Guil-&#xD;
ford stood, steering the vessel in towards the&#xD;
foot of the cliff.&#xD;
"I shall take care to keep it myself," he mut-&#xD;
tered, smiling, as if he heard her words with&#xD;
evident satisfaction.&#xD;
The yacht now drew nearer the land, and was&#xD;
soon within the black shadow cast by the tall&#xD;
cliff. A few minutes afterwards she came to&#xD;
the stone pier, where the boats of the castle&#xD;
were usually moored. Here Guilford brought&#xD;
the yacht skilfully to alongside the landing&#xD;
steps. The men obeyed his orders in furling the&#xD;
canvas and making her fast; and then taking&#xD;
the cot up on which the young lord-.was lying,&#xD;
they proceeded to bear him ashore, and convey&#xD;
him up the steep path to the castle. Guilford&#xD;
gave his whole attention to the comfort of the&#xD;
invalid, taking care that the men moved steadily&#xD;
and cautiously, while Lady Kate went on before.&#xD;
At length they reached the gate of the castle,&#xD;
*where, after delivering his charge to the warder,&#xD;
&#xD;
.to whom lqrd Rudolph said he had been merely&#xD;
wounded in  duello, he left to return-to his own&#xD;
home. , But hehad not advanced ten steps from&#xD;
the portcu  pre he was detained by the voice&#xD;
of Lady Kat ofose at his side.&#xD;
" Why, G U    , you do not well to take your&#xD;
leave so quicTor rather no leave at all., You&#xD;
have not given°a time to thank you."&#xD;
" I did but feintforritate your brother nsre&#xD;
if he saw me take leavv of thee,"'he answered,&#xD;
pressing ,o his lips the land she placed confid-&#xD;
ingly in his.&#xD;
" You are too guarded, G4ilford. You know&#xD;
not how proud I have been ofyou this day 4t41&#xD;
night past. I cannot return with  te toe g&#xD;
my sense of your noble delicacy. I pyM j4&#xD;
and understand it all. From this time we know&#xD;
each other, and you will not mistrust me ?"&#xD;
"Mistrust thee, Lady Kate ?"&#xD;
" Nay, that is not the word, exactly. But&#xD;
you will not doubt my regard for you ?"&#xD;
"I cannot; you are too kind, when you know,&#xD;
as I now do fully, how far beneath you-I am."&#xD;
"Love knows no-rank. You are worthy of&#xD;
me, or I should never have- loved or cared for&#xD;
you. How like you Red Hand3".&#xD;
"And that noble gentleman and right hearted&#xD;
patriot was the famous sea king I have heard&#xD;
so much of. How difficult is for me-to realize&#xD;
that in the Earl Villiers I saw none other than&#xD;
that celebrated captain."&#xD;
"Do you not like him ?"&#xD;
"It seems to me I could die for him."&#xD;
"So do all men who know him, my father&#xD;
says; and he is not the least of his fri  . But&#xD;
how shall I forgive him his act of to  1"&#xD;
,"It was" terrible, retribution, Lady , but&#xD;
was it not deserved ?"&#xD;
"I cannot deny it. My brother has deeply&#xD;
wronged him; and perhaps it is just be himself&#xD;
should endure something of the suffering he has&#xD;
indicted upon. him. It was a mercy that he&#xD;
spared his life. Now, my noble friend, since we&#xD;
must part, tell me frankly where you are to go-&#xD;
what course you have marked out for yourself,&#xD;
so that one day you may come back and ask my&#xD;
hand of my father; for, as thou hast said thou&#xD;
must achieve somewhat to please him and give&#xD;
thee honor., I will wait thy time, true to thee,&#xD;
even to death, so that thou comest not in life to&#xD;
laim me as' thine."&#xD;

sweet confidence of a woman who lpyes with'all&#xD;
her heart.&#xD;

SURPRIsING INTELLIGENCE TO GUILFORD.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Marry have I? Blood shed for the prince.&#xD;
You must know that I did but fill a cup in the&#xD;
inn yonder to the Prince Charles, when, these&#xD;
Cromwell troopers set uponlie, and wouldthave&#xD;
slain me outright, but for Dame Bess, the' boe-&#xD;
teas, who took my part, and told them roundly&#xD;
I was but a poor, innocent, and meant nsibody&#xD;
no harm, and wouldn't hurt a fly, as thou  know-&#xD;
est, Master Guilford."&#xD;
"What have Cromwell's troopers top in the&#xD;

" Cromwell's troopers? .What, hast t " not&#xD;

woman and child in' all the village had hear .&#xD;

port, there is two hundred and fifty of the shaven&#xD;
crowned, psalm-singing rogues."&#xD;
"What are, they doing here ? When did they&#xD;
come ?" asked Guilford, with surprise; for hav-&#xD;
ing left the village just before their arrival the&#xD;
evening before, he knew nothing of the object&#xD;
of this newyg ision o( the covenanters, though&#xD;
that a partypfy.them were in the town he was&#xD;
aware, from their chase of the captain. But he&#xD;
ignorant of'the particulars.&#xD;

ward down the hill :towards the country-side,&#xD;
and which conducted perseps who left the castle&#xD;
for the, interior, to the main road a, mile off.&#xD;
Upon reaching the deep glen at the foot of. the&#xD;
eminence, Guil(ord struck into a broader cart-&#xD;
way that went in the direction of 'the village.&#xD;
He walked onward, lost in his own thought, and&#xD;
thinking upon the chances of the future. He&#xD;
had emerged from the little dale, and had the&#xD;
village roofs in sight, when the voices of singing&#xD;
and bacchanalian  carousing reached his ears.&#xD;
He stopped, surprised' at:what he heard,, and&#xD;
then hastened forward to ascertain the cause of&#xD;
such unusual sounds. He had gone but a few&#xD;
steps further, however, when he saw a man&#xD;
seated by the roadside, groaning in a most piti-&#xD;
able way. He approached him, and recognized&#xD;
Digby, the well-known village busybody and&#xD;
gossip.&#xD;
"Up, man, up ! What aileth the,.Digby ?"&#xD;
"What, is it thee, Master Guilford ?" asked&#xD;
the man, starting to his feet and hugging the&#xD;
young fisherman with great delight. "I am&#xD;
glad to see thee !".&#xD;
" What hath happened ? Thy clothes are torn&#xD;

" I shall be discreet, you may rest assured. I=&#xD;
shall-take care not to propose Prince Charles's&#xD;
health- to a brace of covenanters," he added,&#xD;
laughing.&#xD;
"Nay, take me with thee. Let me keep un-&#xD;

by the way he rolled his eyes up, one woujd&#xD;
have fancied he got great grace from the em-&#xD;

Digby went on talking after this fashion, until&#xD;
they came to a lane turning towards the water&#xD;
from the main street, on which the hamlet was&#xD;
built. At the foot of this lane stood his own&#xD;
cottage. At the corner of it he was challenged&#xD;
by a trooper mounted on a black horse.&#xD;
"Who goes there?"&#xD;
"A fisherman."&#xD;
"Advance, and- let me see if thou smelles.&#xD;
fishy," answered the man, in a coarse manner.&#xD;
Guilford approached him, and taking off his&#xD;

a&#xD;
&#xD;
"Where dost thou live ?"&#xD;
" There !" he answered, pointing at his house.&#xD;
" And what art thou doing abroad so late, for&#xD;
it is well to two o'clock in the morning ?"&#xD;
" I have been a trysting."  '&#xD;
" So I guessed; but, young man, beware of&#xD;
the lusts of flesh, and the pride-of life, and-the&#xD;
allurements of Sathanas. .And who is that with&#xD;
thee ?"&#xD;
" A poor wretch whom I take to fish with me&#xD;
at times."&#xD;
" Let me look at thee closer, thou poorwretch,&#xD;
for a king's eye might hide itself under the&#xD;
shadow of a beggar's cowl."&#xD;
With this the trooper extended the point of&#xD;
his long sword, and catching the cap of Digby&#xD;
upon its end, raised it into the air. 'He then&#xD;
made him approach close to his stirrup, and&#xD;
looked keenly into his round, pug-nosed, bloated&#xD;
visage.&#xD;
"By the beard of Herod, thou art the prince&#xD;
of ale-pots, and must have too much dread of&#xD;

" Digby-Datid, Digby, your highness," an-&#xD;
swered the gossip, with humility.&#xD;
"Thou shouldst be called Balaam," answered&#xD;
the trooper, who, at this moment,'seeing another&#xD;
person running down the street, left Digby and&#xD;
spurred towards him.&#xD;
" By my head, this fellow would as lief seat&#xD;
me unsodden, as he would a hare, Mtater Guil-&#xD;
ford. Didst mark his teeth?"&#xD;
Guilford, however, had taken the opportunity&#xD;
to walk on toward the gate'of his house, and&#xD;
he was about opening it, when he perceived two&#xD;
persons seated within it upon a little wooden&#xD;
settle, which, of an evening, was a common&#xD;
family resort.&#xD;
"It is Guilford !" exclaimedone of the per-&#xD;
sons, springing up on seeing'him.&#xD;
" What, Anne ?Up so late?    It is near&#xD;
morning.".&#xD;
. "I know it, cousin, but-but-one could'not&#xD;
sleep with two soldiers within; and besides,&#xD;
they have my bed; and moreover, Ait{t Betsy&#xD;
bade me wait without and watch for your re-&#xD;
turn."&#xD;
"Guilford, you'do not know me here in the,&#xD;
shadow."&#xD;
" What, Robin ? Is it you?"&#xD;
"I have been keeping thy, cousin Anne cow-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE Y(&#xD;
&#xD;
pany, waiting for thee. I would not leave her&#xD;
and your mother alone during your absence,&#xD;
with two troopers in the house."&#xD;
" You are very kind, Robin. I know not&#xD;
how to thank you. But," he added, smiling,&#xD;
"I suppose you have not been without your&#xD;
sweet reward, from what I saw as I interrupted&#xD;
you."9&#xD;
Robin colored, and Anne held down her head.&#xD;
"Not the least sign of jealousy does he show,"&#xD;
she said to herself, with disappointment. "lHe&#xD;
does not tare for me, or love me as Robin does.&#xD;
I will never let him know I have loved him,&#xD;
since he is so cool and indifferent about it."&#xD;
" Where are these men, Robin !" asked Guil-&#xD;
ford.&#xD;
"One is asleep, with his head laid on the&#xD;
table; the other is stretched on the bed in boots&#xD;
and sword, and snoring away like a swine?'&#xD;
"So much the better. Where is my mother ?"&#xD;
" She is in the back room," said Anne; "But&#xD;
I have a-"&#xD;
" Have what?" asked Guilford, seeing her&#xD;
hesitate and draw back, after seeming about to&#xD;
make some important communication to him.&#xD;
"I forget.. Nothing."&#xD;
"You remain here with Anne, Robin, until I&#xD;
return,' said Guilford. " I wish to speak-a few&#xD;
words with my mother. 4iave then something&#xD;
I wish to say to you." &#xD;
"I will stay with Anne ithpleasure," an-&#xD;
swered Robin.. "Now, sweet Anne, what did I&#xD;
tell thee? Did I not say he loved thee.only as&#xD;
a cousin ? Thou seest he cared not a stiver for&#xD;
my being with thee so matny hours of .moon-&#xD;
light,.whereas, if he had loved thee, he would&#xD;
have-shown his jealousy; for beshrew me ! sup-&#xD;
pose I, loving thee as I do, should lba' come&#xD;
home late #t night and found thee up with'a&#xD;
young fellow, in a bower, his arm about thy&#xD;
,waist, and thy hand in his; 'should I not have&#xD;
&#xD;
45&#xD;
taken fire, aid had a quarrel with thee on the&#xD;
spot? To     lre. Love would act no other-&#xD;
wise. But,     does thy cousin Guilford do?&#xD;
He thank      for keeping thee company as&#xD;
quietly as  thou wert his sist'br, acd now&#xD;
marches intotle house,.bidding me keep thee&#xD;
company a littlelonger. Does this look as if&#xD;
he loved thee, test thou?"&#xD;
" I am satisfies r Bne, robin," answered Anne&#xD;
with tears in her eyes.: "I see that he cares&#xD;
nothing for me."&#xD;
"Then why wilt thoulnt care for me ? I&#xD;
love thee with all my heart!, I will try and&#xD;
make thee happy. You will never fnd a truer&#xD;
heart than that I offer thee."&#xD;
"I will be thine, Robin. I know you love&#xD;
me. I will think no more of my cousin Guil-&#xD;
ford."&#xD;
At hearing this, the happy Robin caught the&#xD;
fair girl to his heart, and imprinted upon her&#xD;
lips the seal of betrothal. The kiss was strangely&#xD;
echoed, as it a person had thrust his finger into&#xD;
his cheek 9nd drawn it out quickly,-causing a&#xD;
popping sound. Both looked up and beheld&#xD;
Digby.&#xD;
"That's what I like to see,".he said. "Noth-&#xD;
ing like loving one another. Well, I'll fet the&#xD;
whole village knowof it to-morrow; qnd when&#xD;
you. are married you must invite Digby.' You&#xD;
can't have a.wedding without Digby. Nothing&#xD;
goes on right without'Digby. Where's Master&#xD;
Guilford gone, Miss Anne "¢;&#xD;
"In the house," answered the maiden, blush-&#xD;
ing and laughing. "0, you eavesdropper !&#xD;
Come hither, Digby. If you will say.nothing&#xD;
about this, I will give you a silver sixpence nert&#xD;
Saturday night, to drink the prince's healthy"&#xD;

CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
AN INTERESTING COMMUNICATION.&#xD;
&#xD;
GUILFORD found the door of the cottage ajar, who, with a few scraps of the Old Testament&#xD;
and pushing it softly, he entered the small, on their lips, passed for pious covenanters, and&#xD;
plainly, furnished front room. A lamp filled under the cloak of religion, did all sorts of en-&#xD;

mirably succeeded.  Sleeping heavily, and with that he might possibly be recognized by some of&#xD;
a loud, sonorous breathing, the other trooper sat the party who had been nighest when he shot&#xD;
by the table, his head among the cups, and rest- the soldier, though it was moonlight and not&#xD;

light shone upon his round; closely shaven head, trying to swim his horse round the promontory.&#xD;

up into a ball. By the side of his head lay his up from her needle, and seeing him, uttered an&#xD;
pistolet, the grasp of his hand holding it loosely exclamation of joy, and going towards him to&#xD;

of two wild beasts he had once seen crushed and silence and warning.  14  x&#xD;

Those men in the other room must have an-&#xD;
noyed you not a little."&#xD;
" They did at first, but they soon drank them-&#xD;
selves to-insensibility. But where is Anne, that&#xD;
she did not come in with you ?"&#xD;
" She is at the gate with Robin."&#xD;
"Yes. He loves her, and I wish she could&#xD;
return his attachment. She had best come in,&#xD;
now you are at home ; but I sent her out, as the&#xD;
soldiers got to be something rude of speech to-&#xD;
wards her."A&#xD;
"They had best keep their tongues under&#xD;
civility," answered Guilford, "or I will show&#xD;
them that there are men in England besides&#xD;
Cromwell's myrmidons."&#xD;
" Hist, Guilford ! They will hear you. As it&#xD;
is, they do not suspect us of being opposed to the&#xD;
government. But listen to me; I have some-&#xD;
thing of moment to communicate to thee; and&#xD;
for this I have been so anxious to have thee&#xD;
come back."&#xD;
"But first hear what will please you, my dear&#xD;
mother. My interview with Lady Kate resulted&#xD;
in her refusal to permit me to cease to think of&#xD;
her, and it is decided that I am to seek my for-&#xD;
tune in the world, and some bright day come&#xD;
back to ask- her hand."&#xD;
"Ah, my boy, fortune is fickle. But the Lady&#xD;
Cathnrine shows a truly noble nature."&#xD;
*I have no doubt-that I shall be able to win&#xD;
some name that will make me less Qbscure, and&#xD;
more worthy to ask her hand of-her noble father.&#xD;
Would she wed me to-morrow, I am too proud&#xD;
to become her husband as I am--a poor young&#xD;
fisherman. I will win rank and name, and lay&#xD;
them-at her feet. Because she loves me in my&#xD;
humble state, shall I willingly consent that she&#xD;
shall wed 'o  so lowly ? Shall I thus reward&#xD;
her generous love ?"&#xD;
"Thou art noble in mind, my boy," said his&#xD;
mother, "and deservest her."&#xD;
" Mother, thou hast heard of Red Hand ?"&#xD;
"0, Red Hand, the noted sea warrior, whose&#xD;
very name strikes such terror along the coast !&#xD;
What of him, Guilford ?"&#xD;
"Dost thou know his history ?"&#xD;
"Nayd I do recollect that it is said-he was one&#xD;
of King Charles's nobles, and that, when he was&#xD;
to have been executed, he placed his hand be-&#xD;
neaththe axe instead Of his head, and with the&#xD;
other wrenched the weapon from the headsman's&#xD;
grasp, and with it cut his way to the water-side&#xD;
and escaped in a ship."&#xD;

He is the Earl of Villiers, a true-hearted noble-&#xD;
man, and friend of both the late king and Prince&#xD;
Charles."&#xD;
" Speak lower, for there are strange ears near&#xD;
us."&#xD;
"The two brutes are asleep, and I pray they&#xD;
may not wake till morning. Yes, motlier,&#xD;
Earl Villiers is a true English gentleman. He&#xD;
commands a ship because he cannot command&#xD;
a fleet. His wars are made only against the&#xD;
usurper. His ship is the only remnantAof the&#xD;
true British navy, and he the only British ad-&#xD;
miral, as Charles, the wanderer prince, is, the&#xD;
only British king. But these things will not&#xD;
always be so. In a few days I slball, if nothing&#xD;
more favorable turns up,, offer myself to,,,this&#xD;
-admiral of the Red Hand, and win fame wf4 r&#xD;
his flag."&#xD;
"If this terrible captain be a true earl, who&#xD;
only seeks the rights of his king, I do not say&#xD;
aught against this, Guilford, save that I shall be&#xD;
grieved to have thee leave my roof and my side.,&#xD;
But mothers cannot always hope to have their&#xD;
boys with them; and I hope to see you yet dis-&#xD;
tinguish yourself."&#xD;
"You will not be 'alone, mother. Anne will&#xD;
remain, and if she marries Robin "-&#xD;
" Marries Robin? I wish she would, indeed."&#xD;
" There is little doubt of it from what I&#xD;
saw to-night. They are lovers, or lovers never&#xD;
were."&#xD;
" That is good news at last. I knew she need&#xD;
never look to feu."&#xD;
" Look to me, mother Who ?"&#xD;
"Anne. Bless me, how odd you have never&#xD;
seen it in her eyes. She has loved you better&#xD;
than cousin ought to love, Guilford."&#xD;

anything about'any of the tnpers having been&#xD;
shot'?"&#xD;
" Surely I did. FPugenough was made about&#xD;
it. The troopers helx heard firing, and went&#xD;
out, and after a lon-time came back, and, swore&#xD;
dreadful oaths, and said some smugglers had&#xD;
shot three of the  r party who were pursuing a&#xD;
loyalist. jThy made great talk of it in their&#xD;
cups, and swore dreadfully how they would on&#xD;
the morrow have vengeance."'&#xD;
" Smugglers they said, did they, mother'?"&#xD;
" I believe so ; but do not raise, your voice so&#xD;
loud; for I dare say we've been overheard in&#xD;
half we've said by the poor gentleman, if by&#xD;
chance he's awake."&#xD;
Here the good dame cast her eyes up at the&#xD;
trap in-the ceiling.&#xD;
"What poor gentleman? What do you mean,&#xD;
mother'?"&#xD;
"Hush! the troopers'll hear you, and then&#xD;
it's all up with him, be he peasant or prince,&#xD;
gentle or simple. There is a man hid up in the&#xD;
hemp loft !" she added, whispering close in his&#xD;
ear, and' then clapping her fingers across his&#xD;
mouth.- "Not a word. I fancy he is a loyalist.&#xD;
Don't speak, and I'll tell you all about it, for&#xD;
I want your advice to know what to do with&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"If he is a loyalist, I willaid him to the best&#xD;
of my ability, mother. But when and how did&#xD;
he come here?"&#xD;
'"That I will tell you. You see, after you&#xD;
went out, and had been gone a little while, the&#xD;
two soldiers came in and invited themselves to&#xD;
take up their quarters for the night. After eat-&#xD;
ing their supper and drinking, they got up and&#xD;
went out, as they said, to make a search'of the&#xD;
remises, to see what out-houses, boats, hid-&#xD;
inigplaces and such things, for concealing and&#xD;
escaping in we had."&#xD;
4The prying devils !"&#xD;
"listi They had not gone out scarcely, be-&#xD;
fore I saw a face looking in upon me at that&#xD;
window. Before I could make out who it might&#xD;
be, the window was raised, and in stepped a&#xD;
stranger. He came so lightly to the floor, looked&#xD;
so be       ly and suffering-like, and had al-&#xD;
&#xD;
together such an appearance of weariness and&#xD;
flight, that I at once felt my charity warm to-&#xD;
wards him kindly ; pnd knowing how many good&#xD;
men there are who are wanderers ih their own,&#xD;
or what is worse,/foreign lands, I bethought me&#xD;
this man might be one of them. The idea that&#xD;
he was a robber or a criminal never once en-&#xD;
tered my mind. He asked me in a voice that&#xD;
was courteous and respectful, if I would conceal&#xD;
him before the soldiers came back."&#xD;
"Then he knew they were quartered here'?"&#xD;
said Guilford, who had listened with the deepest&#xD;
interest to her words.            y,&#xD;
"Yes; for he had plainly been watching their&#xD;
departure ; and, as they went out one way, he&#xD;
came in another way, as I told you. I'instantly&#xD;
closed this door, dropped the curtains, that no&#xD;
one might see into the room, and pointing to the&#xD;
ladder, told him to conceal himself at once in&#xD;
the loft. He obeyed at once, and having given&#xD;
him food and drink, I removed the ladder."&#xD;
"Have yon spolgen with him since?"&#xD;
"'Not a word. He is as quiet as the grave.&#xD;
I think he must be asleep; -for he looked ready&#xD;
to drop. Ygu should have seen what a white&#xD;
hand he had."&#xD;
" How old a man is he?"&#xD;
" About thirty; but he looked pale and hag,&#xD;
gard, and might notMave been so much."&#xD;
"How was he drs'ed?"     .&#xD;
" In a sort of grayish black, plain and coarse,&#xD;
and much worn aid road soiled. His hair wa&#xD;
jet black, and so were his eyes; and his manners&#xD;
were those of a gentleman ; that I saw-at once."&#xD;
"I would like to know who he is, mother,"&#xD;
said Guilford, who had listened to all, she had&#xD;
said with the liveliest attention. "He is without&#xD;
doubt one of the prince's friends, who are now&#xD;
hunted like wild beasts throughout the king-&#xD;
dom."&#xD;
" What if it should be the prince himself?"&#xD;
whispered thegood dame, with a wistful look.&#xD;
" It can hardly be; yet it is clear he is ex&#xD;
pected to seek the coast, and should he do so,&#xD;
he is likely to come pretty much as this stranger&#xD;
has presented himself to you. Whoever he is,&#xD;
he needs our protection, and his life may depend&#xD;
on our care and discretion."&#xD;
"What can be done'?"&#xD;
" That must be reflected upon, dear mother.&#xD;
It will not be safe for him to remain where he&#xD;
is. If a search of the house should take place,&#xD;
the loft will not escape their eyes. I must, how-&#xD;
ever, first see him and know what 'he would&#xD;
have."                   -   -&#xD;

UILeORb's PLAN yOR ESCAPE.&#xD;
Tnres speaking, Guilford returned into the loyal friends as I find you and the good atie&#xD;

as before, and in the same postures. He then  These words were spoken in an under tone,&#xD;

"I will give thee all the g4have, which is&#xD;

" Thou wilt need all thy ged, sir cavalier. I&#xD;

"But what, my young friend ?" asked the&#xD;
stranger, who seemed tohanig on his words with&#xD;
nervous eagerness.&#xD;
" The difficulty is-to get off from the coast&#xD;
unseen. Thered;:sre not only troops placed in&#xD;
our houses, butthey are posted as sentries along&#xD;
the streets, id have the beach' in full view for&#xD;
miles. It would be almost impossible to get a&#xD;
boat off with any chance of success."&#xD;
. The stranger clasped his hands together with&#xD;
an expression of anguish.&#xD;
" So near liberty, and yet not to be able to&#xD;
obtain it !"&#xD;
"Does thy life pay the forfeit, sir, of thy cap=&#xD;
ture ?" asked Guilford, whose heart was deeply&#xD;
moved by his acute' distress.&#xD;
" Assuredly, my friend."                 -&#xD;
"And thou art a true friend of the prince ?"&#xD;
"Ie,has none near."&#xD;
" Then I will save thee if it be possible, by&#xD;
aiding thee to reach the French shore. But the&#xD;
prince, where is he?  Hast thou any tidings'o&#xD;
him since he was seen last in Scotland ?"'&#xD;
"lEe still wanders. Like me he seeks to find&#xD;
shelter in France. Suppose I were the Prince&#xD;
Charles himself, what couldst thou do for me, ii&#xD;
I told thee I was really in thy hands ?"&#xD;
"I would save thee or perish!" answered&#xD;
Guilford; "and I will do all I can for one who&#xD;
loves him and suffers for him. Here it is no'&#xD;
safe for thee to remain till morning."&#xD;
"Young man," .said the stranger, "if thou&#xD;
savest me, the prince will not fail to rewar&#xD;
thee."&#xD;
" I ask no reward, sir cavalier, save success&#xD;
I will ere long return to you. I will go and se&#xD;
how I can best secure your safety."&#xD;
With these words Guilford took leave of hi&#xD;
guest, deeply interested in him, and opening th&#xD;
trap-door, dropped lightly to the floor.&#xD;
" Mother, he is a cavalier, and friend of th&#xD;
prince, and his life is-forfeit if he be taken. H&#xD;

" Here they are. What wouldst thou with&#xD;
them ?"&#xD;
"To hand them up to our guest to put on."&#xD;
'Guilford suited the action to the word, by&#xD;
rolling the articles in a bundle and passing them&#xD;
up to the fugitive.&#xD;
"Put these on, and wait till I knock thrice on&#xD;
the trap, and then come boldly down. Now,&#xD;
mother," he added, as the trap-door was once&#xD;
more closed, and the ladder carefully removed,&#xD;
"I want you to put on your other shawl and&#xD;
hood, and walk out with me."&#xD;
"Whither ?"&#xD;
"It matters not, dear mother. Do not ask&#xD;
me questions that I perhaps can't answer; but&#xD;
if you will kindly do as I say, we may save the&#xD;

Cromwell's are still snoring. They sleep sound&#xD;
as moles."&#xD;
"I drugged their negus to make them sleep&#xD;
and keep them quiet," answered his mother.&#xD;
f   " That accounts for it. It is the more favorable&#xD;
to us. Now take my arm and, come with me."&#xD;
The good dame placed her arm in his, and&#xD;
crossing noiselessly the room where the troopers&#xD;
f were, they went out by the gate of the cottage.&#xD;
Here they met with Robin and Anne, who hardly&#xD;
realized how the night they had so lovingly&#xD;
passed was wearing towards morning. They&#xD;
t both started consciously as they saw dame Gra-&#xD;
ham and Guilford.&#xD;
"You've come at last, Guilford," said Robin,&#xD;
I not knowing anything else to say.&#xD;
"Yes; and I warrant me you were not over&#xD;
. weary waiting for me. I want you, Robin."&#xD;
e   " Anne, you had best go softly-in and remain&#xD;
in the back room; if the troopers should wake&#xD;
s up, you can bolt- the door."&#xD;
e   " Let Anne wait here by the gate, mother.&#xD;
You will not be away five minutes. Robin, go&#xD;
e to your boat; place secretly three days' provis-&#xD;
e ions in it, and put off aa expeditiously-as:you&#xD;
n can, as if on a fishing cruise. Soon as you get&#xD;
3t out half a mile, lower your sails and ,row back&#xD;
I in the direction of the beach, rock, landing be-&#xD;
e yond it on the castle side. There you will find&#xD;
nie to take me on board. Do not delay, and bea&#xD;
&#xD;
THE YOUNG&#xD;
discreet and cautious; for the least imprudence&#xD;
will create suspicion among the coast guard."&#xD;
Robin .signified his readiness to do as his&#xD;
friend Guilford had directed, and immediately&#xD;
left the cottage gate and walked towards his&#xD;
own cabin, a quarter of- a mile ,further east,&#xD;
along the shore-curved street of the little 'port.&#xD;
He was stopped by two troopers, who, satisfy-&#xD;
ing themselves that he was a fisherman, and not&#xD;
a prince in disguise, let him pass.  the door&#xD;
of his own hut he found three of the gu rd seated&#xD;
drinking ale, and eating rolls and dried fish.&#xD;
He adroitly got them Into conversation upon&#xD;
the comparative speed of boats and horses, and&#xD;
drew them down to the cove, fifty paces off,&#xD;
where his own smack lay, and got them to ex-&#xD;
amining it, he the while descanting upon its&#xD;
speed. He then proposed to show them with&#xD;
what rapidity he could row it, saying: "As it is&#xD;
near day, it is time I should get ready to go out&#xD;
to fish; but first I will show you her mettle."&#xD;
He then went in for his oars, and at the same&#xD;
timefilled a bag with fish and bread, and took&#xD;
a beaker of fresh water with him. These he&#xD;
placed in-the boat before their eyes, trusting to&#xD;
their absence of all suspicion that he had any&#xD;
second purpose in view. At length, having got&#xD;
all prepared, he loosed his boat and got to his&#xD;
oars, and was about to row her out, when a&#xD;
fourth, in the uniform of a sergeant, came up&#xD;
and demanded what boat was putting off.&#xD;
"A fisher's lad going off to cruise the day in&#xD;
the channel catching fish," answered a trooper;&#xD;
"and he has bet a hundred mackerel that his&#xD;
boat, with two oars, can beat the best hunter in&#xD;
England."&#xD;
" He is a braggart," answered the sergeant.&#xD;
"Bdt who has been in the boat and seen that&#xD;
there is no Prince Charley hidden in the cuddle.&#xD;
By the beard of Cromwell, it would hide two&#xD;
men !"&#xD;
"No one has searched," answered one of the&#xD;
troopers.&#xD;
The boat was detained and the cuddie; care-&#xD;
fully examined, when, 'as nothing was , cov-&#xD;
ered like a refugee, and Robin being ele  'the&#xD;
only person on board, he was suffered to' put off.&#xD;
His bungling rowing to and fro, however, as he&#xD;
knew it would be, was laughed at by the sol-&#xD;
diets, and having acknowledged that his craft&#xD;
wag ti in trim, he hoisted sail, and told them&#xD;
thaiwhen he'had caught the hundred mackerel,,&#xD;
he would not fail to pay his bet. He was soon&#xD;
rapidlyfleavig the shore behind, and the forms&#xD;
of the soliers shon blended with the indistinct&#xD;
&#xD;
P  ~ingMw.                          51&#xD;
objects on the land. When he had gained half&#xD;
a mile from*  beach, he lowered his two sails,'&#xD;
and takg t;loars, pulled towards the point&#xD;
nearly a ni   westerly, where Guilfdrd had&#xD;
promised to I A, nd.&#xD;
We now ret 'jto the young fisherman who&#xD;
was so generou  ; about to attempt to save his&#xD;
guest from the      of the -usurper. When&#xD;
Robin took leave   'to go on the mission&#xD;
we have 'seen him acco plish so successfully,&#xD;
Guilford, with his mojker waning on his arm,&#xD;
walked along the village strt in the direction&#xD;
which led towards the castle  They soon came&#xD;
to two troopers, who were standing in the street&#xD;
acting as guards. The moonlight shone full&#xD;
upon them, and in one of them Guilfor4 recog.&#xD;
nized the soldier who had before challenged&#xD;
him. As the young man and his mother drew&#xD;
near, one of the men stepped across the way&#xD;
and presented his broad-sword.&#xD;
" What, pr y, is this, my fine couple !"' he&#xD;
said, with a augh.&#xD;
"This is  y mother; and, as for me, I told&#xD;
you who I as some while ago," answered&#xD;
Guilford, fir .&#xD;
"Yes, Ifecollect thee now; but wemust see&#xD;
thy face. We must not let any nospass' us&#xD;
under cover. A woman's hood, before now, has&#xD;
hid a man's beard."&#xD;
Dame Graham put back her hood andshowed&#xD;
him a dignified, but pale, matronly face, that&#xD;
abashed his insolence.&#xD;
"Pardon us, ma'am; but we 'must be strict."&#xD;
"Can we pass on ?" asked Guilford.&#xD;
"Whither ?"&#xD;
" To the castle. There is a sick person there&#xD;
who suffers, and your orders are not go strict as&#xD;
to prevent passing to and fro on the land."&#xD;
"No ; it is the sea we are to watch."&#xD;
Guilford then went on a few steps, ansd when&#xD;
beyond ear-shot, he said quickly to his mother:&#xD;
"Pretend that thou hast forgotten the lint,&#xD;
and go back as for it ; but instead of coming&#xD;
back thyself, send the guest, telling him I wait'&#xD;
here, and that he must join me and take my&#xD;
arm without a word, in your place. They will&#xD;
not a second time lift the veil."&#xD;
"I now understand all," said his mother.&#xD;
"Sir soldier, my mother would return a mo-&#xD;
ment to the house for something," he said, re-&#xD;
turning sere the two men stood. "Be quick,&#xD;
dear mother, and I will remain talking..with&#xD;
these brave soldiers."&#xD;
The good dame hastened towards house,&#xD;
leaving Guilford with the troopers.&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
SUoCESS O: G UIL1ORDs MANORtnE.&#xD;
&#xD;
f Thtotr art a tall youth to be under thy moth-&#xD;
er's eye still, young man," said the trooper who&#xD;
M4 been chief spokesman. " Fishing must be&#xD;
fool's pastime for a brave spirit as thine should.&#xD;
be by thine eye. Why wilt thou not enlist in&#xD;
the troop, and follow the fortunes of a soldier ?"&#xD;
"My mother has only me, and if I should fall&#xD;
in battle she would be desolate."&#xD;
"We should be better weaned than to think&#xD;
of mothers when our beards are grown, young&#xD;
fallow. A man's mother is his country, and he&#xD;
rightly obeys her when he takes up arms to deh&#xD;
fand her against tyrahny." A pause.&#xD;
"Come to the inn in the morn, where our&#xD;
captain is, and thou shalt put thy name down&#xD;
and be paid two gold nobles, and the horse and&#xD;
armor of the' man who was shot early to-night&#xD;
by one of the smugglers, shall be thine."&#xD;
" I will see thy captain, it may be, and think&#xD;
of thia, I would rather have a wider field than&#xD;
this to act may part in."-'-&#xD;
Ay, that thou oughtest, man. To-morrow&#xD;
we are going on a fancy party to ferret out these.&#xD;
smugglers or what not that rescued-the loyalist&#xD;
last night, and shot that 'lion of the desert,'&#xD;
evetg the brave trooper 'Despise not Prophesy-&#xD;
) 3&#xD;
"What loyalists"e-&#xD;
"T is not. known for certain. That he&#xD;
&#xD;
was one is clear, for he refused to drink to&#xD;
Oliver's health; and he fought-like a tiger when&#xD;
he was set upon, and ran like a dromedary when&#xD;
he could fight no longer against odds. We&#xD;
would have had him had he not been rescued by&#xD;
a party of smugglers, as some say they were,&#xD;
who got him off safe. Our captain swears he&#xD;
was the famed Red Hand, the channel cruiser,&#xD;
because his right hand was missing. But, for,&#xD;
my part, the blood of one royalist is as red as&#xD;
that of another."&#xD;
"Dost thou expect to find smugglers on the&#xD;
coast to-morrow ?" asked Guilford, whose eyes&#xD;
were anxiously turned towards the gate of the&#xD;
cottage,&#xD;
" That maybe as it turns out. A little brush&#xD;
with the rogue and a good deal of booty would&#xD;
enliven these dull times."&#xD;
At this moment Guilford's eyes were glad-&#xD;
de -%by the sight of a female figure clad like&#xD;
other , issuing from the cottage gate. IHe&#xD;
ki  at a glance that it was not she, and his&#xD;
heart bounded with hope and fear in contemp-&#xD;
lating the advance of the disguised royalist.&#xD;
The walk was wholly unlike that of his mother,&#xD;
and by no means as graceful; but he huppd the.&#xD;
soldiers, who had never seen her but once, would&#xD;
not mark the difference.&#xD;
"ood night, gentlemen ; I see my mother&#xD;

&#xD;
'has got what she went after, and isreturning,"&#xD;
said Guilford, walking forward to meet the dis-&#xD;
guised guest.                           I&#xD;
"You will not forget the gold nobles and to&#xD;
see the captain at the inn ?" called one of the&#xD;
soldiers.&#xD;
"No.. I hope to meet you there also."  -&#xD;
By this time he met the loyalist, and taking&#xD;
his'arm beneath his own, whispered:&#xD;
",Walk more softly, and keep hooded. There&#xD;
is no, danger if you do not speak."&#xD;
It Was a thrilling moment when Guilford came&#xD;
up again to. the two men in order to pass&#xD;
them., lie was, however, perfectly cool and&#xD;
self-possessed.     ,&#xD;
"We must stop again, mother, for doubtless&#xD;
these brave soldiers will have to make thee show&#xD;
thy face asecond time, to see that no;beard hath&#xD;
grown on it within the last five minutes.",-&#xD;
" Nay, young fellow, thou and thy mother may&#xD;
pass, when thou wilt," answered the nearest sol-&#xD;
dier, laughingly. " When' thou gettest to be a&#xD;
trooper, thou wilt then learn to obey orders."&#xD;
"I blame thee not, sir trooper," answered&#xD;
Guilfordl; as he walked on slowlyin order to&#xD;
keep,.at feminine moderation the tendency'of his&#xD;
-companion _to make rapid, strides of it along.&#xD;
At every yard whibh separated him from- the two&#xD;
soldiers his-heart beat lighter and his breath drew&#xD;
freer. At length, after walking on about five&#xD;
minutes,:andwhen he could scarcely distinguish&#xD;
.the formspf the two;men from:the black posts&#xD;
to which the, fishermen secured their boats, he&#xD;
said, in a tone of joy:&#xD;
Now, sir cavalier, you may speak. We are'&#xD;
safe, at least for the present. , You can look out&#xD;
of thy hood."..           ,            .&#xD;
The;cavalier whom -dame Graham   had so&#xD;
fromptly-and kilfully put in her own place,&#xD;
then;threw partly back-r hood, and looked&#xD;
around him, but not' before pressing the young&#xD;
fisherman's hand inboth of his, and saying :"&#xD;
",haypa reward-thee ! Thou hast done this&#xD;
well and faithfully, and with remarkable courage.&#xD;
1 was;never in more imminent peril of capt ge ;&#xD;
and yet, under thy managing guidance, widgo,&#xD;
littlegreasp to fear. What lofty castle is this ?"&#xD;
he asked,:'as his eye fell;upon the elevated towers&#xD;
and, battlements' of"Castle. Vane, beneath the,&#xD;
shadowfof whch he ,W4s walking.&#xD;
" Well do I know the family. Never was a&#xD;
more lgyal subject than Lord Vane. But rumor&#xD;
- says hin spnise Cromwell's tool."&#xD;
&#xD;
'&#xD;
&#xD;
" Yes, so I have heard," answered Guilford,&#xD;
whose glances were continually scantlning the&#xD;
water, searching:for Robin's little bark, which r&#xD;
yet did not appeariih sight.&#xD;
The cavalier alsifturned his eyes wistfully on&#xD;
the sparkling wave ,and paused to contemplate-&#xD;
them for a moment.&#xD;
" 0, road to liberty yet a more insurmount-&#xD;
able walk than if thou wert built of adamant,&#xD;
high as heaven!"&#xD;
"Do not stop; my lord. We must still hasten&#xD;
forward; for though the last guard of troopers&#xD;
ijss been passed in this direction, yet our'strata-&#xD;
gem may be detected, and pursuit made."&#xD;
" I need no inducements to nove on, my true&#xD;
and faithful deliverer," answered the ro list ;&#xD;
"but I am something wearied, having walked for&#xD;
many days, and laid abroad of nights, and h4d&#xD;
little food."&#xD;
" I pity thy distresses, sir.,&#xD;
"I hope fortune will one day enable me to&#xD;
reward' you," answered the. stranger, with a&#xD;
grateful tremor in his tones. "But Ianst solicit-&#xD;
ous lest, harm should happen'to thy tiother for&#xD;
the part she has.taken."&#xD;
" No ; it was known to no one'that-you Were&#xD;
in the house; and I instructed her not te suffer&#xD;
herself to be seen until.after' sunrise, lest indeed,&#xD;
by chance, the two troopers should question her&#xD;
how she got back unseen, and so place heroin a&#xD;
dangerous position."'&#xD;
" That was judicious and thoughtful in you.&#xD;
I will therefore not suffer' my fears to. be awak.&#xD;
ened about her. But when I know that upon&#xD;
wvhomsoever aids me I am bringing danger, "I&#xD;
sometimes feel like giving myself up to :my fate&#xD;
before'l will involve anymdre /kind and noble&#xD;
hearts in assisting me to escape. We have here.&#xD;
a barrier ! How shall we surmount it I", he&#xD;
suddenly demanded, upon finding the beach ter-&#xD;
minate.&#xD;
"Here is a boat, my lor," said Guilford, who&#xD;
gave the stranger this title of respect, judging&#xD;
from his manner; and that he was a partizan of&#xD;
the prince, that he must be noble ; "we will en-&#xD;
ter it and row around it."  '&#xD;
Upon their reaching the other side Guilford&#xD;
with an exclamation of .pleasure, pointed sea-&#xD;
ward.        '''&#xD;
"A boat!1 0, that I were so happy ag'to be&#xD;
on board of it, with its head pointed tow  '&#xD;
France "' was the ,exclamation of the wan  y&#xD;
with clasped hands.-&#xD;
"I think it is the boat L ordered to rad'&#xD;

54'              TIM rou~ro  sRa&#xD;
&#xD;
and meet us here," answered Guilford. " When&#xD;
it gets a little nearer I can tell.".&#xD;
"And you have perfected your plan so far as&#xD;
to 'provide a boat ! Ah, this  t more than I&#xD;
hoped. When I saw this elif, I believed you&#xD;
were seeking some secret cavar wherein to con-&#xD;
ceal me ; and my heart was heavy with the&#xD;
thought of more delay,.nd confinement and&#xD;
anxiety before I should kiss the blessed sands df&#xD;
France !"&#xD;
" It is Robini's boat. .I know it now by the&#xD;
white tops to its masts."&#xD;
"And is Robin's boat that you sent for to em-.&#xD;
bark us in ?"&#xD;
" Yes, my lord. Robin is a youth, and sup-&#xD;
ports himself by fishing. He is my truest friend,&#xD;
and can be trusted."&#xD;
" I know it, if he is thy friend. It seems a&#xD;
brave, strong boat, with sails."&#xD;
"It has crossed the channel in the wildest&#xD;
weather, my lord."&#xD;
" Then my hour of safety seems to have come&#xD;
at last. This little skiff, which holds but two,&#xD;
and scarce floats for leaking," he added, pointing&#xD;
to the small boat in which they had paddled&#xD;
round the rock; "this I would have ventured in,&#xD;
rather than not have attempted it. To die ex-&#xD;
erting one's self for liberty, is better than to live&#xD;
as I have lived the past fifty days. 0, young&#xD;
man, you know little of the sufferings I have en-&#xD;
dured. But the sight of this bounding bark&#xD;
makes me forget all!"&#xD;
"I trust, my lord, that- before noon you will&#xD;
be safe where you wish to be."&#xD;
"Thanks, thanks, my friend. I pray that if&#xD;
this blessing be granted me, it be given soon to&#xD;
the-poor friends and wanderers I leave still be-&#xD;
hind."&#xD;
" Thou meanest the prince, and the four or&#xD;
five nobles who hold to him."&#xD;
" They did hold to him till they were com-&#xD;
pelled, for his safety to leave him, and each seek&#xD;
a different route to the coast."&#xD;
"If, after I safely place thee in France, I can&#xD;
return unsuspected, my lord, I will do all in my&#xD;
power to get the rest over. In particular would&#xD;
I be happy to be the instrument of saving the&#xD;
prince."&#xD;
"And wherefore in particulur, my young&#xD;
friend '" asked the noble, who was seated on a&#xD;
rik, watching thoT advancing fishing boat.&#xD;
" Frankly, my lord, I will tell thee. Thou&#xD;
didst o   ear my conversation with my mother,&#xD;
and -n  'iot be told that I love a high-born&#xD;
&#xD;
maiden-even the daughter of the lord of this&#xD;
castle."&#xD;
" And I would swear thou art worthy of her."&#xD;
" I am too proud to offer her a fisherman for&#xD;
a husband. If I could aid the prince, perhaps&#xD;
he would take me into his service."&#xD;
" But he is poor, and has nor men nor arms,.&#xD;
coffers nor coin, young man."&#xD;
"He will one day, I am confident, sit on the&#xD;
throne of his martyred father. He is too deeply&#xD;
seated in the hearts of the English people to re-&#xD;
main long out of the seat of the kingdom."&#xD;
"By the roodI thou speakestlike a prophetI"&#xD;
,exclaimed the noble, starting to his 'feet, and&#xD;
gazing with admiration upon the young man.&#xD;
" I pray that thy words may come true. And if&#xD;
the prince come to his own, thou shalt not be&#xD;
forgotten. He who has served one of his friends&#xD;
serves him. I will take care that thy good ser-&#xD;
vice to me this night shall not be forgotten.&#xD;
Would that England had ten thousand young&#xD;
men with hearts and hands as loyal as thine."&#xD;
At this crisis the little bark drew so close that&#xD;
Guilford recognized Robin, who, shipping his&#xD;
oars, steered the boat with what impetus his row-&#xD;
ing had given it, directly alongside the rock.&#xD;
"Thou hast well done, Robin, and in good&#xD;
time; for I see the dawn is breaking. Now, my&#xD;
lord, step into the boat, and the next land thy&#xD;
foot touches shall be that of France."-&#xD;
" Amen, my friend," answered the noble, as&#xD;
he leaped into the boat and stood in the stern.&#xD;
"Farewell, poor England1 One of these days&#xD;
thou wilt take to thy bosom gladly the children&#xD;
that thou now drivest from thee."&#xD;
Guilford saw that tears came into his eyes,&#xD;
and this emotion endeared him still more to him&#xD;
for he saw that he possessed all the sensibilities&#xD;
that became a man. He now assisted Robin in&#xD;
hoisting the sails, foithere was a six knot&#xD;
breeze from the northwest, and taking the helm,&#xD;
while Robin was entrusted with the charge of&#xD;
trimming the canvas, he steered away from/the&#xD;
castle rock and lay his course at first south by-&#xD;
west, in order to Ijeep from being seen from the&#xD;
village when they should clear the rock.&#xD;
When they had got out about ffty yatds, and&#xD;
were sailirig along smoothly, the nobleman *as&#xD;
seen by Guilford to sink upon his knees and re-&#xD;
main some -minutes in prayer. Herthen rose,&#xD;
and embracing his deliverer, he called Robin and&#xD;
said-&#xD;
"Let me take thee by the hand. I owe thee&#xD;
much also, and must owe thee more before I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE YOUNG&#xD;
reach France. I am told thou art the friend of&#xD;
this brave young man."&#xD;
"I love Guilford as a brother," answered&#xD;
Robin, with honest warmth.&#xD;
Suddenly a voice called to them from the&#xD;
shore-an eager but suppressed voice, its tones&#xD;
being doubtful and yet thrilling, as if fear and&#xD;
hope impelled the speaker.&#xD;
" The boat ! Art thou fishermen ?"&#xD;
"Yes," answered Guilford, as he discerned the&#xD;
figures of two men in the mouth of a sort of&#xD;
gorge that was at the westward of the castle&#xD;
rock.&#xD;
" Come to the shore and take us on board,&#xD;
and we will pay thee well."&#xD;
"I fear that it is a lure," said Guilford.&#xD;
"I think I recognize the voice," said the&#xD;
stranger. "Hold ! Let me speak."&#xD;
" Nay, niy lord, you may betray yourself. I&#xD;
will hail them. Who are, you, and where do&#xD;
you wish to go ?"              -&#xD;
"Land, and we will tell thee," answered&#xD;
another voice.&#xD;
"I know them !" cried the stranger to Guil-&#xD;
ford, in earnest excitement, laying his hand on&#xD;
his shoulder. ",They are two of the prince's&#xD;
friends. Will you take them '"&#xD;
"Willingly. Think you the prince is one of&#xD;
them V'&#xD;
"IWe may hear from him through them, my&#xD;
young friend. Steer at once towhere they stand,&#xD;
&#xD;
FISHERMAN.                             55&#xD;
for delay may be fatal to them with so many&#xD;
enemies about."&#xD;
Guilford at once ran the smack to the little&#xD;
cove in the land where the two men stood. On&#xD;
coming near he saw from their torn apparel and&#xD;
.haggard air that they were fugitives. They were&#xD;
so impatient to quit the land, that the boat had&#xD;
hardly touched the rock before they both sprang&#xD;
on board.&#xD;
" Take us across to France, and we will repay&#xD;
you well, for we have gold," they said, talking&#xD;
like men who had life at stake.&#xD;
The stranger, who still wore the female dress,&#xD;
and who had purposely concealed himself behind&#xD;
the sail, was now seen by them. They stared at&#xD;
him, and then took their seats, as if too weary&#xD;
to stand. They then looked earnestly at Robin&#xD;
and Guilford.&#xD;
" You are fishermen, then ?" said the eldest of&#xD;
the two, inquiringly.&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
" Will you take us over to Normandy '"&#xD;
"It is !a dangerous trip, sirs, but as I amn&#xD;
over, you shall have passage."&#xD;
" How fortunate. We will give you gold."&#xD;
" I am well paid, gentlemen."&#xD;
"But willyou take this woman over V"&#xD;
"Yes," answered uilford ; snd would bare)&#xD;
added, "she is a fugitive disguised also," but for&#xD;
a pressuA upon the arm by the stranger,-as a&#xD;
hint from him to keep his secret.&#xD;

Wz now see our youthful hero, Guilford,    "I knew, my lord," said Guilford, "that'&#xD;

Guilford had witnessed this 'revelation of the&#xD;
ptince to his partners in dangers nVfii it, with&#xD;
amazement. He stood beholding him without&#xD;
power to utter a word. A half formed idea that&#xD;
all his hopes were now in the budding, and that&#xD;
Lady Kate would yet be his, danced bewilder-&#xD;
ingly through his mind. Robin stood with open&#xD;
mouth, in wonder and delight.&#xD;
"Nay;my friends," said Prince Charles, " you&#xD;
must not be shut out from being partakers of all&#xD;
this joy. You have, you find, had your wish&#xD;
gratified, and have 'the prince' in your boat."&#xD;
"Ana I will save thee or die, my prince !"&#xD;
exclaimed Guilford, kneeling and kissing his&#xD;
hand. " Tsis is the happiest and proudest mo-&#xD;

Robin also came forward and saluted the ex-&#xD;
cited monarch, and all was joy and intense ex-&#xD;
citement.&#xD;
While the little vessel with its precious freight&#xD;
was dancing on its way, Guilford directed Robin&#xD;
to bring up the 'provisions from the cuddie, and&#xD;
the prince and his two lords made a royal feast&#xD;
of it, with such appetites as long fasting invariably&#xD;

" Is there no danger that we shall be interfered&#xD;

solicitude, as he cast his eyes about him and saw&#xD;
four or five sail of vessels at various distances,&#xD;
some of them between them and the distant line&#xD;
of the coast of France, and one directly stern,&#xD;
as if in chase.&#xD;
" Are there ships cruising on the watch, my&#xD;
lords ?" asked Guilford, changing color. " I&#xD;
did not imagine danger save from the coast guard&#xD;
on shore."&#xD;

CHAPTER XVii.&#xD;
A DESPERATE STRATAGEM FOILED.&#xD;
&#xD;
LEAVING the little fishing smack, which held&#xD;
the destinies of England, to dance along over&#xD;
the waves of the channel on its way to the coast&#xD;
of Normandy, we will follow the adventures of&#xD;
another one of the characters of our story.&#xD;
When Red Hand the earl had regained his&#xD;
own ship, and, after the severe execution of the&#xD;
sentence upon Lord Rudolph, had dismissed the&#xD;
yacht, he gave orders to his lieutenant in com-&#xD;
mand to steer westward until sunrise, an4 then'&#xD;
call him.&#xD;
"I have not had one hour's sleep since I left&#xD;
London," he added to the officer, " and I must&#xD;
have a little rest."&#xD;
Ue then went'to his state-room, where he found&#xD;
Edward, the useful and handsome officer AV&#xD;
ready introduced to the reader, engaged incopy-&#xD;
ing papers. Upon the entrance of the earl, the&#xD;
youth looked up and fixed upon the earl his&#xD;
large dark eye, which had as much light in it as&#xD;
a woman's, avid said:&#xD;
" My lord, I know not how to contain my joy&#xD;
at your safe return once.moreto the ship, know-&#xD;
ing, as I alone did, the perilous errand on which&#xD;
you went."&#xD;
"I had a narrow escape of -it more than once,&#xD;
Edward," answered the earl, throwing himself&#xD;
upon a cushioned settee.&#xD;
" And 'what success, my lord ?" asked the&#xD;
&#xD;
youth, in a tone that slightly hesitated, as if he&#xD;
feared he ventured too far to make so open an&#xD;
inquiry.&#xD;
" Cromwell's -head is still on his shoulders,&#xD;
and he is free to ride on England's neck till a&#xD;
more lucky day for us. Would you like to hear&#xD;
the particulars V"&#xD;
"Yesj my lord ; I will first copy these two re&#xD;
maining lines of the letter you have written to&#xD;
the Duke of Orleans, to be'left at Cherbourg."&#xD;
The youthful secretary then busied himself a&#xD;
minute till he had completed the task allotted to&#xD;
him, and then placing his pen, by hit side on the&#xD;
polished Bragiban table, placed himself in an&#xD;
attitude of listening. This young man, whose&#xD;
beauty, as we have said, was almost feminine,&#xD;
was about twenty years of age, slight in figure,&#xD;
but tall, and gracefully made. A brown mous-&#xD;
tache was just beginning to darkenhis well cat&#xD;
upper lip, and his rich and shining brown locks&#xD;
curled short about his circular and snow-white&#xD;
neck. His brows were also brown or hazel col-&#xD;
ored, like his hair, and exquisitly arched over a&#xD;
pair of large, well expanded eyes of the clearest&#xD;
gray. Hisnose was 'erian, straight, and with&#xD;
thin nostrils-generally a mark of high birth.&#xD;
When he spoke, rows of even teeth, as dewy and&#xD;
translucent as pearl, were visible. His hands&#xD;
were, as symmetrical as nature could :hae  *&#xD;

&#xD;
moulded them, and his whole air and tone were&#xD;
striking and distinguished. There was an ex-&#xD;
pression of sadness upon his face that seemed to&#xD;
be abiding, and to derive itself from a source&#xD;
deeply hidden in the heart. With all his beauty,&#xD;
there was a total absence of consciousness of it,&#xD;
and with all his womanly elegance there was no&#xD;
lack of the proud and manly bearing of his sex.&#xD;
Between him and the earl there appeared to ex-&#xD;
ist a friendship equal and confidential, and&#xD;
which seemed to take no count of the difference&#xD;
in their years. The attire of the young secretary&#xD;
was a suit of black velvet, with here and there a&#xD;
plain gold button, and a silver hilted sword,&#xD;
worn in a polished Arabian belt at his side.&#xD;
"The night on which I landed at Hastings,"&#xD;
said Red Hand, " twenty days ago to-day, I&#xD;
found the three men ready with horses to take&#xD;
me to London. I was nearly two days reaching&#xD;
the city, not wishing to ride too fast, lest I&#xD;
should draw attention. I wore my disguise as a&#xD;
Puritan conventicle preacher, and had much&#xD;
honor paid me at several times, by Cromwell's&#xD;
people. At length, safe in London, I put up at&#xD;
the house in the Strand where Lord Layton and&#xD;
Germain were lodged.    They received me&#xD;
warmly, and asked where. I had landed and&#xD;
where left my ship. I told them that I had left&#xD;
my vessel off Hastings, but that, by my orders,&#xD;
she was to-run to the coast of France and hover&#xD;
about Germany until the twentieth, when she&#xD;
was to stand over the Sussex side and wait my&#xD;
orders, or take me on board, as you have done&#xD;
this night."&#xD;
" Youhave read the report of our cruise, my&#xD;
lord; during your three weeks' absence ?" ob-'&#xD;
served the young lieutenant.&#xD;
"Yes, I have looked it over, and find you have&#xD;
had too many handsome fights with Cromwell's&#xD;
vessels; but one of these I heard of before I left&#xD;
London, and I assure you it made me proud of&#xD;
iny'gallant friends 'on board, and my noble ves-&#xD;

week in London we had All our plans laid. Un-&#xD;
der t'he disguise of a coal' heater, I had more&#xD;
than once stood within ten feet of Cromowell, as&#xD;
&#xD;
he passed through the palace yard, where I was&#xD;
heaving coal, having managed to get employed&#xD;
there for this purpose. Under the disguise of a&#xD;
baker, I entered the palace, and, as a postman,&#xD;
I placed letters in his very hand. All these&#xD;
opportunities I sought to see him and learn his&#xD;
habits and hours, that we might know what day&#xD;
and hour to fix upon our plan for carrying him&#xD;
off. At length I discovered that every Tuesday&#xD;
and Saturday it was his custom to embark on&#xD;
the Thames to sail up to -  palace, there to&#xD;
be present -at a council which he had convoked&#xD;
for the purpose of settling upon a new code of&#xD;
justice for the commonwealth, it being his inten-&#xD;
tion to adopt the Justinian code, if possible, over&#xD;
the common law. We resolved that we would&#xD;
have everything ready to lay hands upon him&#xD;
when he should return, from one of these excur-&#xD;
sions, which we ascertained would be towards&#xD;
twilight.&#xD;
"I had already obtained a swift barge with two&#xD;
masts and eight oars, and had placed over her a&#xD;
deck that would conceal twelve men. This&#xD;
barge we had placed under a warehouse that&#xD;
belonged to a trusty loyalist. The eight oars-&#xD;
men were selected by me from  a scoie of the&#xD;
young nobles who'are living in London in'dis-&#xD;
guise and poverty, ready' to enter' upon any en-&#xD;
terprise that may bring back the king; byderoy-&#xD;
ing the usurper.  The twelve aien concealed in&#xD;
the' deck were' all 'born lords and-barons;half&#xD;
Scotch and half English."&#xD;
"(Each equally anxious to share the perilid&#xD;
the glory !"&#xD;
"X es. At length the afternoon, four, days&#xD;
ago, arrived. One by one, by different' routes,&#xD;
the lords and gentlemen reached the rendezvous,&#xD;
entered the boat and concealed themselves, with&#xD;
arms in their hands, under the deck. I was the&#xD;
last person there, and went accompanied by'the&#xD;
French lieutenant, whose ship was waiting' off.&#xD;

four o'clock: Isaw the protector embark in'his'&#xD;

for he holds court and carries statg like a crowned&#xD;
king. In the bow were eight'soldiers of his-bdy&#xD;
guard, armed with harquebuses. At abotithslf&#xD;
an hour before sundown I saw his barge -half'&#xD;
mile off, descending the river. It was returning&#xD;
earlier'than we expected, but on consulting with&#xD;
the lords, we decided to attack it in open sun-&#xD;
shine, and trust to the swiftness ofdur barge to&#xD;
escape down the river 'with our prize."&#xD;
&#xD;
"It was a very bold enterprise,'my lord."&#xD;
" One mtst do a, bold thing who would at-&#xD;
tempt to make 'Cromwell--prisoner. Standing:&#xD;
-upon the pier, I watched the descending barge':&#xD;
until it had come nearly opposite our lurking&#xD;
place, when, lowering myself into my boat, I&#xD;
said:&#xD;
""My friends, now is our 'time! -'Oars, all&#xD;
give way and launch out into the' river.'&#xD;
"IThe next moment we shot out from beneath&#xD;
the arch of the old pier, and steered with foam-&#xD;

down the whdle bank:of oars, was so great as to&#xD;

but ere long reach France in safety. Nay, I have&#xD;
a presentiment that it will not be long ere you&#xD;
and I shall behold him in security."&#xD;
" I earnestly pray, my lord, that your wishes&#xD;
may be fully realized."&#xD;
"You mean that my eighth sense may not&#xD;
deceive-me," responded the earl, laughing. "But&#xD;
my dear Edward, I have a rare romance to tell&#xD;
thee."&#xD;
" Ah, my lord !"&#xD;
" Yes. This young Guilford Graham, with&#xD;
his handsome face and fine eyes, has captivated&#xD;
no less a personage than the fair Lady Catharine&#xD;
Vane."&#xD;
" Impossible, my lord."&#xD;
"Nothing more true, Edward. And as to its&#xD;
being impossible, there is nothing more possible,&#xD;
when two young hearts come together and are&#xD;
found to be of kindred mould. How he man-&#xD;
aged first to win her heart, is to me a mystery ;&#xD;
but as he lives at the foot-of Castle Vane, I&#xD;
doubt not they have been thrown together in&#xD;
some way very naturally, and what with his rev-&#xD;
erence for her rank and respectful homage, and&#xD;
her admiration of his person, and perhaps grati-&#xD;
tude for rustic civilities, they got to losing their&#xD;
hearts to each other. But be that as it may, they&#xD;
are lovers, and she loves quite as enthusiastically&#xD;
as he does."&#xD;
" I like the young man-I am grateful to him&#xD;
-I respect his courage-but for him to aspire&#xD;
to-"&#xD;
" Tat, tut, my dear Edwardi The days of&#xD;
chivalry are filled with such real romances of life.&#xD;
A humble lover and high-born maiden are the&#xD;
theme and and burden of half the ballads."&#xD;
" That is true. But-"&#xD;
"I have however, something to add that will&#xD;
make youlike the young man's honor. It would&#xD;
seem he has lately awakened to the practical view&#xD;
of his romantic attachment, and last night he&#xD;
was on the way to see the lady to release her&#xD;
fromall love vows, and tell her that he felt that&#xD;
they never could be united, holding such opposite&#xD;
&#xD;
FISHERMAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
positions in society. It was on thiserrand he&#xD;
saw me beset and gave me such good aid. And,&#xD;
oddly enough, on board my ship he finds the&#xD;
Lady Catharine.. They had an interview, which&#xD;
I chanced to overhear, which resulted in a refu-&#xD;
sal on her part to listen, like a noble girl as&#xD;
she is, to any such sacrifice of his happiness on&#xD;
his part, and to her consenting to wait for him&#xD;
until he shall achieve a name and fame that&#xD;
will give him some pretensions to sue for her&#xD;
hand."&#xD;
"And this compact stands ?"&#xD;
" Yes. And be assured that we shall yet hear&#xD;
of this young man in some honorable and daring&#xD;
exploit. He has it in him, and he has a prize to&#xD;
win that will nerve his arm and carry him to his&#xD;
object through every danger."&#xD;
"I like him well, my lord ! He is certainly&#xD;
deserving of her if she loves him."&#xD;
" I- knew you would like him, and thereforeiI&#xD;
have told you this. It is my intention to seek&#xD;
him out at an early day, as soon as the prince&#xD;
shall have got safely to France, and then give&#xD;
him employment in charge of the vessel and ex-&#xD;
pedition which is planned for another attempt to&#xD;
get possession, if possible, of the person of Crom-&#xD;
well."&#xD;
" I was in hopes, my lord, that in this new ex-&#xD;
pedition I should not be overlooked."&#xD;
" I did promise to give you some opportunity&#xD;
of distinguishing yourself, Edward. But you&#xD;
are too useful to me. I would have you near&#xD;
me ; and besides, I wish from Cherbourg to send&#xD;
you with a message to St. Lo to my fair daugh-&#xD;
ter."&#xD;
Here-the young secretary blushed and'looked&#xD;
pleased.&#xD;
"Besides, wilt thou not, for love's sake, give&#xD;
my young friend Guilford a chance of winning&#xD;
a name that will give him the prince's favor,&#xD;
and thus open a way to his advancement in the&#xD;
world?"&#xD;
"I gainsay it no further, my good lord," an-&#xD;
swered Edward, with a cheerful smile.&#xD;
" Hast thou finished those despatches for&#xD;
Paris ?"&#xD;
" Yes, my lord."&#xD;
"Seal and address them. But first let me see&#xD;
the letter to the French king; for it is important&#xD;
that there be no error in it."&#xD;
The earl took the paper and began reading in&#xD;
a low, audible tone, as follows&#xD;
" Your .moat christian majesty will be pleased&#xD;
to learn that our august Prince Charles, since&#xD;
&#xD;
THE YOUNG&#xD;
&#xD;
the disastrous defeat of his forces near Worces-&#xD;
ter, forty days ago, has hitherto eluded the efforts&#xD;
of Cromwell to take his person captive. I have&#xD;
certain information to convey to your majesty&#xD;
that he is hoveringnear the English south coast,&#xD;
and will embrace the first safe opportunity for&#xD;
embarking across the channel to find that safety&#xD;
in your dominions which your majesty;through&#xD;
me, has so courteously offered to him. It is to&#xD;
be ardently hoped that the prince will reach the&#xD;
French coast ere many days.".&#xD;
The earl continued to read on for a few lines&#xD;
further, but in a less audible manner, and then&#xD;
immediately returning the letterto the secretary,&#xD;
he said:&#xD;
" It is correctly copied and fairly writ.&#xD;
Seal."&#xD;
"You have forgotten to sign it, my lord."&#xD;
" True."&#xD;
The Earl Villiers then took a pen in his left&#xD;
hand and made a capital V, after which he placed&#xD;
a seal that, he took from his sword hilt, upon&#xD;
some wax that Edward had previously placed for&#xD;
the reception of it. It was a shield, on which&#xD;
was a three-masted ship, and for a crest was a&#xD;
hand severed at the wrist.&#xD;
"I wear this seal and badge till Cromwell&#xD;
loses his usurped throne, and then I resume my&#xD;
arms. I will yet make him wince the more, as&#xD;
men say he does at hearing of Red Hand, his&#xD;
deadly foe ! Now I would have thee pen a let-&#xD;
ter to my fair daughter, at the convent St. Lo.&#xD;
It is four weeks since she wrote me the sweet&#xD;
missile which pleased me so, and I have deigned&#xD;
it no reply. Come, sir, thou art my right hand,&#xD;
and I would have thee write to a lady as I would&#xD;
have done in my younger days. Let the script&#xD;
be smaller than that in which thou hast writ to&#xD;
the French king, and by no means so large as&#xD;
that wherewith thou writest to our English bar-&#xD;
ons. A handwriting for ,a lady's eye, let me&#xD;
teach thee, young cavalier, should be graceful in&#xD;
shape, neat in all its arts, of a cunning and&#xD;
pleasing fashion, and without mar or blot. I&#xD;
like well the Italian script for this business.&#xD;
Dost thou know it ?"&#xD;
" Yes, my lord ; I have cultivated all styles of&#xD;
Spain, of France, of Italy, and of Germany."&#xD;
"Let us have that of Italy."&#xD;
" I am ready, my lord."&#xD;
" Then say these words with thy own finish ;&#xD;

ships than in the art of penmansh4p. Now to thy&#xD;

letter ; but this is a busy season since the mishap&#xD;
to the prince's army, and I am compelled to&#xD;
keep astir, and mostly on the sea, forI am hoping&#xD;
to give the prince the opportunity of getting off&#xD;

and love. Heavenbless thee, fair daughter Jen-&#xD;
ny, and soon place thee in the arms of thy loving&#xD;
father,&#xD;
ARTHUR, EARL OF VILLISns."&#xD;
This letter having been duly penned by the&#xD;
youthful secretary, Red Hand settled himself&#xD;
upon his couch and gave himself up to the pro-&#xD;
posed sleep which he so much needed,while Ed.&#xD;
ward continued at the escritoire writing and&#xD;
sealing pacquets addressed to various exiled no-&#xD;
blemen in France.&#xD;
At length the day broke, and the earl, rising,&#xD;
went to the deck. His keen eye surveyed the&#xD;
horizon. Three or four vessels were in sight,&#xD;
one of which, far to the eastward, was made' out&#xD;
to be a brig-of-war, but as she showed no colors,&#xD;
her nature could not be made out ; though as she&#xD;
was near the French coast, she was-supposed to&#xD;
be a vessel of that nation. Some dozen fishing&#xD;
vessels were also seen running about. Upon all&#xD;
three Red Hand directed the long, heavy tele-&#xD;
scope of that day, and then, having swept the&#xD;
French coast near which he was sailing, he and-&#xD;
denly gave orders to put about ; for up to that&#xD;

" Lay her course E. N. East," said Red Hand.&#xD;
"We will run up, the channel and keep cruising&#xD;
between Normandy and Sussex, for we may be&#xD;
so fortunate as to fall in with some of the fugi-&#xD;
tiv99 crossing who will give us news of-the prince.&#xD;
Keep a close watch on all the fishing boats, and&#xD;
run close to each of them, so that if any of the&#xD;
prince's party be in them, we may take them on&#xD;
board."&#xD;
The ship how stretched eastward under all her&#xD;
&#xD;
canvas, for the breeze was light from the -south&#xD;
and south by west, and every sail had to be set&#xD;
to get six knots an hour out of her. The men,&#xD;
after they hacl breakfasted, were called to quar-&#xD;
ters and trained to 'the guns, to keep-them in&#xD;
constant practice ; for they were surrounded by&#xD;
hostile vessels, and might at any hour find them&#xD;
selves engaged in mortal conflict with some of&#xD;
Cromwell's ships.- . In this manner, closely ex-&#xD;
amining every craft, the royal cruiser of the chan-&#xD;
nel kept on her course, thesight of tier causing&#xD;
many an English trading vessel to up helm and&#xD;

British side,&#xD;

About half past three in the afternoon, as the - "A ship of thi largest class, my lord ?"&#xD;
earl was about to give orders to alter the course . "Yes, and one of Cromwell's bull-dogs. I&#xD;

the Leviathan, and is twice our metal.. She hast&#xD;
a breeze with her, too, and seems to be steering&#xD;
dead for us."&#xD;
"You may be sure, my lord, she knows who'&#xD;
we are."&#xD;
" Without doubt.  We have boarded craft&#xD;
enough since morning to report us in that quar-4&#xD;
ter."&#xD;
'My lord," said the quartermaster, who had&#xD;
been~for some minutes inspecting the ship in the&#xD;
northern board.&#xD;
" Well, Claypole, what now l"&#xD;
"The chap there a-weather is coming down&#xD;
with a bone in his teeth. iHe has an ugly look&#xD;
about the muzzle."&#xD;
"If he comes too near, we will spoil his muz-&#xD;
zle for him, if that is the case," said the earl,&#xD;
cheerfully; for he was one of those'chivalrous&#xD;
natures that"take delight - in the accumulation&#xD;
of dangers. " The fellow off the quarter has&#xD;
also a breeze, while we lay as quiet here as'if&#xD;
we were at our anchors. fiave supper for the&#xD;
men early, and then have all hands to quarters,",&#xD;
he called out. " We shall hardly get away&#xD;
from these two inquisitive gentlemen who- are&#xD;
coming down this way to look; at us, without a&#xD;
brush:"&#xD;
At hearing' this, the whole quarterdeck was&#xD;
in excitement.  The -fficers smiled and ex-&#xD;
changed congratulations with each other at the&#xD;
prospect of a battle, wbile the rumor flying for-&#xD;
ward among 'the men, iMused a spirit- of bel-&#xD;
ligerepey into their bosoms that completely&#xD;
changed the whole aspect of things. One wld&#xD;
have thonht that the happiest intelligence had-&#xD;
reached them, instead of the report that two&#xD;
large, armed foes were coming down upon them,&#xD;
probably to attack them, and possibly destroy&#xD;
them and their vessel. -But if the faced of the&#xD;
officers and men brightened,, the oiuntenance of&#xD;
their chief, Red Hand, shone with courage and&#xD;
warlike anticipation. Already, in numerous in&#xD;
stances had he met the ships of the, usurper-and&#xD;
cegquered them,though inferior in strength to&#xD;
them. And so:frequent, bold and successful had&#xD;
been his assaults upon ships, castles, mand even&#xD;
towns on the coast, that in proportion as people&#xD;
held his name in awe, his own confidence in his&#xD;
invincibility had increased.&#xD;
Cape de la Hague, oppositeghiich the ship&#xD;
of ~the earl lay, scarcely in motipafor want of&#xD;
wind, has two horns, and in the. bay between&#xD;
them lies the town of Cherbourg. This port&#xD;
&#xD;
was in full sight; not twdleages'4istants¢ 'cis&#xD;
the ship,-*hile astern an ahead,,ifaIlke&#xD;
to leeward, lay tie two tapes.' To th't il&amp;amp;i&#xD;
ward the'faint'blue 'line of the' Coast  of SSAe&#xD;
and the Isle of Wight=were visible, forty lifes&#xD;
off. A little asteht and about seven tdiles dis-&#xD;
tant, was the larger ship, the Leviathan, coning&#xD;
down on the wind, and steering as if runni&#xD;
quietly for Cherbourg. Forward of the bean,&#xD;
in the northern board, also was to be seen the&#xD;
other ship, steering also for Cherbourg; though'&#xD;
as this was a French port, 'there was no prbb r&#xD;
ability of their being bound there ; but'ts the&#xD;
Prince Charles lay directly in the track to 'the&#xD;
'port, this vessel was very clearly the object at'&#xD;
which they were aiming. There were soms half&#xD;
a score of small craft in sight, and far distant&#xD;
two, or three English fishing-boats.&#xD;
The men at length bad their supper, and th&#xD;
officers also, so. that the after eubins, with 'tte&#xD;
bulkheads removed, were soon turned into op'eui&#xD;
decks with men at 'the guns. At length, abo&#xD;
four o'clock, the Leviathan came sot near as '  {_r' '&#xD;
show her ports to the naked eyes of the men&#xD;
the channel cruiser ; but the wind had got ahead&#xD;
of her, and ,Red Hand was able to manage hIt       .&#xD;
vessel under motion with a five-knot breeze.&#xD;
The ship which was coming from the coast of&#xD;
England, was now near enough for her guns to&#xD;
be counted; 'but instead of keeping on for the&#xD;
Prince Charles, she suddenly hauled her wind&#xD;
and stood six or seven points eastward.&#xD;
f That is a new manoeuvre," exclaimed ted&#xD;
Hand, as he saw it; and catching up, his glaaW'&#xD;
he directed it towards her. "She is 'in chasf'&#xD;
a fishing smack I" he cried. "I see the smack&#xD;
about two miles ahead of her to the southland&#xD;
evidently flying from.her. They are wetting her'&#xD;
sails and using their'oars. There must be some-&#xD;
thing more than usual in the wind, for a frigate&#xD;
to .turn out of her 'course 'toehuse a  fishing-&#xD;
vessel !Crowd every stitch of!canvas 'up i'the&#xD;
ship, sir 1" he ordered, in tones of unusu 'ani-&#xD;
iation.&#xD;
"The smack is making for the Frenei Coast&#xD;
as fast as she can make speed," said the t ter-&#xD;
master, with his eye to his glass:&#xD;
The whole attention of every one on board&#xD;
the'eruiser as now directed to the frigate' and&#xD;
the fugitive fishing-smack  If there had been&#xD;
any doubt in the minds of any one-as to the ob-&#xD;
ject which had turned the English tessel'from&#xD;
her courseiwas now removed by her firing at&#xD;
long shot at the escaping little craft.&#xD;

66                          THE YOUNG&#xD;
rowd on e-li every yard of sail 1" shouted&#xD;
the earl. "We .must cut the frigate off from&#xD;
hlc   se.. Ten to one, there is some one of the&#xD;
prince's friends in her, and the glass of the cap-&#xD;
tain of the frigate has detected him."&#xD;
All on board was now intense enthusiasm.&#xD;
Every nautical art was brought into use to in-&#xD;
crease the ship's velocity, and enable her to cut&#xD;
off the fishing-smack. The latter had full five&#xD;
miles yet to sail before she could reach the French&#xD;
shore. She was aiming for the little fishing port&#xD;
of Feschamps, beyond the cape. On her star-&#xD;
board quarter, not two and a half miles distant,&#xD;
and pressing all canvas after, and firing at inter-&#xD;
vals, was the frigate we have spoken of, and&#xD;
from the rapidity with which she gained on her,&#xD;
there was every prospect of her capturing the&#xD;
prize for which she seemed to be straining all&#xD;
her nerve.&#xD;
the cidiser Prince Charles was about a mile&#xD;
and a half from the fishing-smack, and so had a&#xD;
mile advantage of the frigate for cutting her off;&#xD;
as she had to run all this distance to inter-&#xD;
herself between them, it was feared by Red&#xD;
d that the smack might be destroyed by the&#xD;
set of the frigate. He therefore, as soon as he&#xD;
'tme within range, opened his larboard battery&#xD;
upon her in the most spirited cannonade. This,&#xD;
as he expected, drew the fire of the frigate upon&#xD;
him, but'she did not cease to crowd sail in chase&#xD;
of the boat, nor to send balls after her from one&#xD;
of her bow chasers.&#xD;
"I will soon put an end to this double game,"&#xD;
said the earl; and bringing his ship into the&#xD;
wind, he opened broadside after broadside upon&#xD;
her so effectually, that she had enough to do to&#xD;
take care of herself and return it. In the midst&#xD;
of the battle, which every moment grew hotter,&#xD;
Edward, who had kept his eye upon the smack&#xD;
with the telescope, exclaimed:&#xD;
" She, has been hit, my lord, and the fisher-&#xD;
men are trying to keep her from sinking. ,But&#xD;
ho! my lord! There is the woman we saw,&#xD;
who has thrown off her gown, and now is work-&#xD;
ing in a man's dress. It is aman, my lord 1"&#xD;
" Then, by the mass i it must be a disguised&#xD;
exile. Let me see 1"&#xD;
The earl took the glass and levelled it at the&#xD;
boat, which had her mainmast shot away, and&#xD;
which was filling fast with water.;&#xD;
" You are right. There are five men now&#xD;
and no woman! That was a disguise. Hoi&#xD;
know we but the fortunes of England are in tha&#xD;
sinking boat! Square away the yards 1" h&#xD;
&#xD;
FISHERMAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
shouted, " and let us go to the succor of the-&#xD;
boat, so that if there be any one in her of note&#xD;
we can give him aid. Keep your batteries play-&#xD;
ing lively, my lords," he called to his officers.&#xD;
" We have knocked the frigate's quarter railing&#xD;
to pieces, and crippled her foremast ; but she is&#xD;
doing her best to come up with the sinking smack.&#xD;
But we will be ahead of her !" -&#xD;
Red Hand now took a position on the bow of&#xD;
his ship, and earnestly kept his glass upon the&#xD;
smack. Both vessels are now about half a mile&#xD;
distant from each other and from the fishing-&#xD;
boat, and drawing nearer under constant firing,&#xD;
to the point at which both aimed.&#xD;
"It is the prince !" shouted one of the officers,&#xD;
who had been for some moments looking at the&#xD;
smack, which, having been cleared from water,&#xD;
the persons in it were once more pulling towards&#xD;
the French coast.&#xD;
"Who? where?" demanded Red Hand, to&#xD;
whom he stood near on the bows.&#xD;
" The man at the smack's helm, steering.&#xD;
Look well, my lord ! He has his hat off, and I&#xD;
can clearly distinguish his features, and his long&#xD;
black hair, and his very figure and air, too."&#xD;
The earl, himself, now took the spy-glass. He&#xD;
looked through it a moment, and then cried, with&#xD;
emotion:.&#xD;
"It is he ! It is the prince! We must save&#xD;
him I Blow this infernal frigate out of the wa-&#xD;
ter i Double shot your guns, my men ! The&#xD;
prince ! our king ! is in yonder sinking bark;&#xD;

red hot shot ! Make your iron-throated guns&#xD;
roar ! See how the frigate gains! Blow her&#xD;
into the air, or they will seize our king from our&#xD;
very grasp !"&#xD;
The ship reeled, and seemed rent in every&#xD;
seam by the terrible discharge of the whole of&#xD;
her broadside at once into the-frigate at scarcely,&#xD;
" musket shot range. The iron storm that rushed&#xD;
through the air seemed to be obedient to the&#xD;
fierce mandate of the chief. One of the red hot'&#xD;
- shot must.have penetrated to: the magazine, for&#xD;
scarcely had the roar of-the discharge ceased,&#xD;
- when it was followed by.an explosion more ap.&#xD;
palling than human ears ever heard. The very&#xD;
surface of the water vibrated.and swang from,&#xD;
I side to side, and the whole heavens seemed rent,&#xD;
while spars, bodies and limbs of men, and even&#xD;
cannon flew through the air, which was filled&#xD;

nessed," said Red Hand, who was the first to sheet fly, and before the wind went on his way&#xD;
break silence. "But it is the fate of war. Come, towards' the English shore.&#xD;
men ! Do - not stand stupified" It has saved  "That man will do as he says, Robin! It&#xD;
our prince ! Behold the royal Charles himself will be hardly safe for either you or I to go back&#xD;
standing at the helm and steering that fishing- at present."&#xD;
smack yonder, In a few-minutes we shall have  "That it wont, Guilford. But -I hope no&#xD;
him safe on board ! His life is cheaply pur- harm will come upon Anne and thy motherr"&#xD;
chased by the five hundred disloyal lives that  "No," answered Guilford, thoughtfully,."they&#xD;
have now just been sacrificed to his safety."  will scarcely dare harm them for our acts. Let&#xD;
We will now return to the smack, on board us hope for the best."&#xD;
&#xD;
which we left the prince asleep, while Guilford,&#xD;
at the helm, was guiding his little vessel with&#xD;
skill and speed across the channel. At one&#xD;
period both the nobles laid down in the bottom&#xD;
of the boat and slept also; so that'the smack&#xD;
was for .several hours wholly under the eye of&#xD;
Guilford and Robin. Not long after the two&#xD;
noblemen had fallen into repose, a small trad-&#xD;
ing lugger passed them, standing towards the&#xD;
Sussex coast. Its owner was well known to be&#xD;
a smuggler, and Guilford, though he knew him&#xD;
well, as 'he belonged to Brighthelmstone, had&#xD;
never any -intercourse with him. This man&#xD;
steered his lugger a little out of her course, in&#xD;
order to pass close to the smack, which Guilford&#xD;
perceiving, tried to prevent; for he did not wish&#xD;
to have the two fugitives who were lying in the&#xD;
bottom of his little vessel, asleep, discovered by&#xD;
him. The lugger, however; kept away for him,&#xD;
and came close under his bows.&#xD;
"Hilloh, master Guilford l" he hailed; "what&#xD;
luck to-day ? Methinks you keep well over to&#xD;
the French coast, when 'at this tide thou shouldst&#xD;
know thou wilt find the fish plentiest off the Isle&#xD;
of Wight."&#xD;
"How dast thou know but that I am bound&#xD;
as thou bast been, to France, to get a cargo of&#xD;
French brandies ?" replied Guilford, in no good&#xD;
humor.     -&#xD;
"Ah, by my head, it would be an honest&#xD;
errand; ay, an honester one, may be," added&#xD;
the man, standing up and stretching, his long&#xD;
neck to look over into the smack, for he had&#xD;
brought his- lugger almost dead into the wind's&#xD;
eye as he was talking; "honesterl than smug-&#xD;
gling over king's' men. I see thou hast a pair !&#xD;
Rare birds,.my lad. How many golden louis&#xD;
dost this day's fishing bring thee ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"And fear the worst for Anne."&#xD;
"It is but a poor courage, Robin, that is ever&#xD;
looking on the dark side. What we wish and&#xD;
believe will almost always come to pass. Let&#xD;
us believe and hope all will be safe with those&#xD;
we love."&#xD;
"How unlucky we should fall in with tha'&#xD;
bad man, Guilford!"&#xD;
" It is all for the best."&#xD;
"I wish I could think about things as quietly&#xD;
as you do. But the fellow cant do us any&#xD;
harm, for we shall get the prince across before&#xD;
any one can be sent after us."&#xD;
" Yes, I hope so. If he .should fall in with&#xD;
any of the channel watch-ships, which we have&#xD;
so fortunately eluded, he will give information,&#xD;
and we shall be pursued. But as we are half&#xD;
way across the channel, I have little fear."&#xD;
"I don't like the looks of the ship astern,"&#xD;
said Robin. " She has ports, I am sure."&#xD;
" I can't well make her out, but she can hsirdly&#xD;
notice us ; and besides, she can't be in chase of&#xD;
us, for she came from the Portsmouth direction."&#xD;
Guilford, however, was in the wrong, for once.&#xD;
The frigate was a guarda coasta, and had been&#xD;
all the day overhauling fishing-boats and ex-&#xD;
amining them, and had seen the smack with&#xD;
other boats some time before. But being spoken&#xD;
by the lugger, the skipper of which pointed out&#xD;
the fishing-vessel, then a league ahead of the&#xD;
ship, as having two fugitives on board, the&#xD;
frigate rewarded the man for his information&#xD;
and crowded on all sail in chase.&#xD;
When she had-been running on this course&#xD;
some half an hour, the captain of the frigate&#xD;
made out Red Hand's vessel, and recognized&#xD;
the ship. Upon making known who she was,&#xD;

THE YOUNG FISHERMAN.               ' 69&#xD;
&#xD;
08                THE YOUNG FISHERMAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
his o cer -were byno means anxious to come&#xD;
in collision with the formidable captain,. and&#xD;
proposed that the course of the frigate should&#xD;
be changed. To this, however, the commander&#xD;
firmly objected. = The disastrous results of the&#xD;
chase, the reader has already seen.&#xD;
When it began, Guilford had called up the&#xD;
prince and made known the exact danger they&#xD;
were in. Prince Charles then manifested the&#xD;
self-possession which always characterized him.&#xD;
Having. closely observed the two vessels, both&#xD;
of which were standing towards him, and both of&#xD;
nhich he supposed to be enemies, he promptly&#xD;
gave directions for the management of their es-&#xD;
cape. -,By his suggestion, Guilford, Robin, and&#xD;
the two noblemen rowed with the four oars, and&#xD;
he himself took the helm, and at- the same time&#xD;
kept the sails -wetted by throwing water upon&#xD;
them with a long-handled scoop which the smack&#xD;
carried for this purpose.&#xD;
"She gains an us, your majesty," said Gu-&#xD;
ford,-whose practised eye could note with more&#xD;
accuracy than theirs the least-variation of dis-&#xD;
tance on the water.&#xD;
"Which of the two, master Guilford ?" asked&#xD;
the prince, now'looking at the frigate astern and&#xD;
now at Red Hand's ship, both of which were&#xD;
equally distant from the smack.&#xD;
"both of them I see now gain. But the ship&#xD;
to the west is, I belieye, a friend, my prince !"&#xD;
suddenly exclaimed Guilford..&#xD;
" A friend ! " Then welcome to her ! But, by,&#xD;
the maceof King Cole, master Guilford, there&#xD;
is but poor chance of a fugitive like me finding&#xD;
a friend in a Cromwell ship."_&#xD;
" I do believe, your majesty, it is the Earl&#xD;
Red Hand's channel cruiser."-&#xD;
" Earl Villiers !" cied the prince, with ani-&#xD;
mation. -The good angels grant it be. ButI&#xD;
fear you are mistaken."&#xD;
"No, my lord- I mean your majesty"-&#xD;
" Let my majesty alone, good master Gra-&#xD;
ham," said the prince.&#xD;
"Nay, shall I not call thee my prince ?"&#xD;
"'If thou wilt. Art sure of the vessel? for&#xD;
the stout earl is one of the staunchest friends I&#xD;
and England have at this dark day."&#xD;
"I can't be mistaken,'my prince,"~responded&#xD;
Guilford,with animation. "Irecognize the poop&#xD;
and the castle on her bows ; for I was on board&#xD;
of her only last night.".&#xD;
" True, The good stars of my house now aid&#xD;
me. Blow, sweet winds ! But nay! The same&#xD;
wind that giveth her to us bringeth our foe."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Your majesty," said Lord Algernon,, the&#xD;
gray-bearded noble, "that must be the Earl Vil--&#xD;
Hers, for that is not the English flag which he&#xD;
has just hoisted."&#xD;
"It is a blue flag with a red hand in the en-,&#xD;
tre !" cried the Scottish lord, with a kindling&#xD;
eye. "It is the earl's ship."&#xD;
" Then there is hope for us yet ! But there&#xD;
comes an iron ball after us," added the prince,&#xD;
as a jet of, smoke belched from the bows of the&#xD;
frigate which had the English cross flying at her&#xD;
mast head, and a shot came bounding over the&#xD;
waves, dashing the spray upon them as it whizzed,&#xD;
past.&#xD;
Another, and a third shot followed, and then&#xD;
they beheld the shipof the earl.come to the wind&#xD;
and open her cannonade. The scene to the eyes&#xD;
of the prince and all with him was so intensely&#xD;
interesting, as they gazed upon the fierce battle&#xD;
between the two ships, that .for a moment they&#xD;
forgot to row. But they were reminded of their&#xD;
duty by a dhot from the frigate, which struck&#xD;
their boat just forward of the beam, on the bulge&#xD;
of the bow,.and cut her down to the water's edge.&#xD;
Instantly they became aware of their peril,&#xD;
and as the boat began to fill, Guilford sprang&#xD;
towards the prince, and placed in his hands a&#xD;
thwart, saying that "it would buoy him up if the&#xD;
boat went down."&#xD;
"Thanks, my brave friend; but what will be-&#xD;
come of thee ?" said the prince, seeing'that the&#xD;
two lords held the other planks.&#xD;
",I will take care of myself. If thou artsaved,&#xD;
my prince,- my poor life will be well offered for&#xD;
thy safety."&#xD;
"That may not be. Can't we save her ?"&#xD;
" Yes, perhaps we can float, if the noble cav-&#xD;
aliers will aid to bale out with their hats."&#xD;
" That we will all do," responded the prince ;&#xD;
and .throwing off the gown, which till now he&#xD;
had worn, he set the example. Robin, in thp&#xD;
meanwhile tried to stop the rush of water in,&#xD;
by throwing his body into the gap, an expedient&#xD;
which was successful ; for soon the little vessel&#xD;
began to rise from the flood and float with more&#xD;
buoyancy. But all their efforts were for a mo-&#xD;
ment suspended by the terrific explosion, which&#xD;
freed them from their enemy astern in the awful&#xD;
manner we have already described.&#xD;
"Merciful heaven assoilzie their poor souls !"&#xD;
reverently ejaculated the prince, as he saw the&#xD;
brave ship plunge headlong beneath the sea with&#xD;
its mass of life. The swell of the sea that fol-&#xD;
lowed the immersion of so large a bulk tossed&#xD;
&#xD;
the smack wildly about, and it required all their&#xD;
united aid to keep her from going down. On&#xD;
all sides were seen the black heads of swimmers,&#xD;
who were calling for aid; for at least six score&#xD;
of the crew were thrown by the explosionunhurt&#xD;
into the sea.                       -&#xD;
"We cannot aid thee, wretches," said the&#xD;
prince, "for we are in a strait equal to thine.&#xD;
' All our hopes depend on the present approach&#xD;
of the earl's ship."&#xD;
This vessel was now within five , hundred&#xD;
fathoms of the smack, which could be scarcely&#xD;
kept afloat. Upon her bows stood Red Hand,&#xD;
calling out manfully to the prince :&#xD;
" Keep up heart, my royal master ! A few&#xD;
seconds more -nd we will reach you ! Down&#xD;
with the boats, but first for me !" he added.&#xD;
The warlike, castellated ship now got within&#xD;
her length of the smack, when the earl sprang&#xD;
into a boat alongside, and pulled by a dozen&#xD;
strong arms, the next moment had the prince's&#xD;
hand in his, and drew him from the foundering&#xD;
fishing vessel into his own barge. Instantly he&#xD;
dropped on his knee before him, and with tears&#xD;
in his eyes kissed his hands.&#xD;
"0, my prince ! my escaped, my beloved and&#xD;
royal Charles !" The air at the same time was&#xD;
5&#xD;
&#xD;
rent with huzzas for Prince Charles, and for a&#xD;
few moments it seemed as if every man in the&#xD;
boats and on the ship were beside themselves.&#xD;
Some shouted, some wept, some huzzaed, some&#xD;
danced over the decks, others embraced, and all&#xD;
was: jy and glad uproar.&#xD;
Escorted by the earl, Prince Charles ascended&#xD;
the, side of the ship, and then every officer&#xD;
pressed around him, knelt before him, and em-&#xD;
braced. him, weeping like children. Charles&#xD;
himself could scarcely see for the emotions that&#xD;
blinded his own eyes with tears. He recognized&#xD;
this one and that one, and called them by name,&#xD;
and kissed on the cheek some of those whom he&#xD;
had once known most intimately.&#xD;
"Now, your highness," said Red Hand, whose&#xD;
war-worn cheeks were wet with tears of delight,&#xD;
"let me lead thee to my cabin."&#xD;
" Nay, not till I have presented to thee and all&#xD;
my friends the brave young man to whom I owe&#xD;
my escape from England. Where is he ?"&#xD;
The prince then looked around for Guilford,&#xD;
and also for Robin, but was told they were in&#xD;
the smack, which some of the sailors wereaiding&#xD;
them in saving from sinking. He then called to&#xD;
him to leave the boat and come en board.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7459-00000034"/>&#xD;
WHEN Guilford, in obedience to the command&#xD;
&#xD;
of the prince, came over the ship's side, and the&#xD;
eyes of the Earl Red Hand fell upon him, the&#xD;
latter exclaimed with~surprise and pleasure:&#xD;
"What ! dost thou owe thy secure flight from&#xD;
the shores of Britain to this young man, your&#xD;
majesty ?"&#xD;
" Yes ; and never will I forget my obligations&#xD;
to him. Advance, master Guilford, and let me&#xD;
present thee as my deliverer t, these my noble&#xD;
friends."&#xD;
"By the rood, sir Guilford !" said the earl, as&#xD;
he warmly grasped his hand, "thou art in luck.&#xD;
Thy star is in the ascendant. Thou art the most&#xD;
fortunate man born ! Come, thou shalt tell me&#xD;
how it has been thy fortune to be of such service&#xD;
to England's king."&#xD;
" My lord," said Edward, who had already&#xD;
exchanged a grasp of the hand with Guilford,&#xD;
" the men in the boats wish to know if they shall&#xD;
save the poor devils who are swimming about&#xD;
the ship ?"&#xD;
" What," exclaimed the prince, " the wretches&#xD;
thrown into the wate? by the explosion of the&#xD;
frigate ?"&#xD;
"Yes, your highness," answered Red Hand.&#xD;
"By all means ! pick them' up to a man, and&#xD;
bediligent! They are All my British subjects.&#xD;
You have room for them, my good Villiers ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, your majesty, as prisoners," answered&#xD;
Red Iand, with a slight cloud upon his brow.&#xD;
" But I have little favor towards the villains who&#xD;
have placed my prince's life in jeopardy."&#xD;
" Let that passI We must be humane, my&#xD;
dear earl. But what ship have we standing down&#xD;
so bravely this way ?"&#xD;
"That is a parliament war vessel, your&#xD;
majesty," answered Red.Hand, who had been so&#xD;
much occupied with the rescue and reception of&#xD;
the prince as ' be heedless of the approach of&#xD;
this vessel, until now she was within a league,&#xD;
and booming down upon them under all her&#xD;
enormous spread of canvas.&#xD;
Red Hand, having escorted the prince to his&#xD;
cabin, and ordered refreshments at once to be&#xD;
placed before him and the two noblemen, hast-&#xD;
ened from his presence, and ascending the&#xD;
highest part of the stern, called Edward to his&#xD;
side.&#xD;
" Place the telescope in rest here, and let me&#xD;
have a sight at this monster, for I begin to fear&#xD;
that the prince, now that he is on board of us,&#xD;
would be safer anywhere else."&#xD;
" There is great danger, my lord," answer !&#xD;
Edward. " She is certainly coming on us fast&#xD;
since we stopped to take the prince on board."&#xD;
" Yes, that she is, and she is already training&#xD;
her guns upon us. Make all sail !" he shouted,&#xD;

At the sound of his ringing commands all&#xD;
was activity from stem  o stern. The boats&#xD;
were hoisted up, and Robin had!the regret to see&#xD;
his smack, to which no repairs could ;be made,&#xD;
drop astern; and at length slowly disappear be-&#xD;
neath the tide,&#xD;
Bt;all that the goodship could do, she could&#xD;
not make her way beyond the-reach of the-Levia-&#xD;
than's long :guns, one of which was now fired&#xD;
upon.her at the farthest range. The;shet fell&#xD;
astrna quarter of.a mile ; but the second shots&#xD;
which soon followed, dropped.into the'ship's&#xD;
wake.&#xD;
" The game is up," said the earl. "It.will not&#xD;
do for the prince- to say half an hour longer on&#xD;
board, for that ship will blpw  ne out,of the&#xD;
water, unlesi.I can; ,ork to windward,- and then&#xD;

"What now? Have I to fly again so sogn,&#xD;

shade of discontent'on his brow. "Iwas induig.&#xD;

"So I hoped, gwur highness. Please cast your&#xD;

"I am in you hands, inj dear earl and my&#xD;

" Two 3'rencbmen,-an old man and a boy,&#xD;

72-                         THE YOUNG&#xD;
Norman fisherman, who 'had all the while re-&#xD;
garded with a sort of bewilderment this summary&#xD;
disposition of his little vessel.&#xD;
" Where will, you land, my prince ?" asked&#xD;
Guilford, as he took the helm.&#xD;
" What-village is that in the bottom of the bay&#xD;
south of us ?"&#xD;
"'eschainps, your majesty !"&#xD;
" Good ! I will land there. We can reach it&#xD;
in an hour, think you "       p.&#xD;
*      !" Yes, your majesty ! The wind is fair and&#xD;
free.'&#xD;
"And so are the shot, it would seem, from&#xD;
yonder huge war ship," responded Charles, as a&#xD;
heavy iron missile from the double-decker flew&#xD;
above heir heads with an appalling roar.&#xD;
"The earl, who had seen the shot pass his own&#xD;
vessel towindward, at once gallantly steered his&#xD;
ship so as to place her in line between the fishing&#xD;
vessel which contained the prince and the enemy ;&#xD;
for be saw'that they were directing their fire to-&#xD;
ika-ds it, as if they suspected it contained some&#xD;
important personage.&#xD;
When prince Charles saw this manoeuvre,&#xD;
whereby the ship completely protected the boat&#xD;
from the double-decker's guns, he 'said, with&#xD;
emotion :&#xD;
"What a true heart that brave Arthur of the&#xD;
ed' Hand, as men term him, has in his manly&#xD;
and Jbyal bosom I He is ready to receive the&#xD;
whole iOre of the formidable foe to protect his&#xD;
prince. It is worth the dangers and, privations&#xD;
I have undergone for me to learn the devotion&#xD;
of my friends. Everywhere I have found trusty&#xD;
confidants, and in no instance have I been be-&#xD;
trayed."/&#xD;
The fishing boat now bounded merrily over&#xD;
the water, ndring the land each moment ; but&#xD;
the sense of 'escape and safety was modified on&#xD;
the prince's part by the danger in which he&#xD;
now saw the courageous earl placed. Without&#xD;
attempting to run away from his enemy, but&#xD;
only tr 'ing to keep his vessel as a shield to cover&#xD;
the prince's retreat, 'the earl held his ship in the&#xD;
wind, and received in his hull a shower of iron&#xD;
balls'that were hurled upon him from the Levia-&#xD;
than, which kept stalking on, belching forth fire&#xD;
and smoke like a moving volcano.&#xD;
At length, when the earl saw that the fishing&#xD;
vessel was -beyond the reach of the double-&#xD;
decker's, guns, and close under the land, quite&#xD;
beyond all danger' of capture, he proceeded to.&#xD;
fight his vessel out of the dangerous situation ini&#xD;
the best manner he was able.- But after firing&#xD;
&#xD;
FISHERMAN.&#xD;
three broadsides, which had no effect upon the&#xD;
double decker, which drew nearer every mo-&#xD;
ment,'he called his officers about hind.&#xD;
"My lords and loyal gentlemen I You need&#xD;
not be told of the imminent peril we are in. The&#xD;
fate of our noble ship is sealed. It is impossible&#xD;
for us to save her. Our only hope for our own&#xD;
safety is to square away and run for the' French&#xD;
coast, and strand her and set her on fire. We&#xD;
have saved the prince I Already ' he is within&#xD;
hail of the coast where he will find an asylum&#xD;
and protection. With this let us be content !&#xD;
If we lose our ship, we shall have the proud con-&#xD;
aciousness of knowing that we sacrificed her for&#xD;
our beloved prince's safety. There remains now&#xD;
but a choice between captivity and the capture&#xD;
of our vessel, or her destruction by our'own&#xD;
hands, and our safety on French -soil. I shall,&#xD;
therefore, with your consent, give orders to'steer&#xD;
straight for the land."&#xD;
The officers were all of the earl's mind, and&#xD;
the next moment the gallant ship, already greatly&#xD;
crippled by the Leviathan's heavy targeting, N&#xD;
squared her yards and drove straight fot the&#xD;
beach, which extended out in front of the town&#xD;
of Cherbourg.   The earl would gladly have&#xD;
landed her near Feschamps, but a reef running&#xD;
but- in front of that place, would have caught&#xD;
the ship half a mile before she could reach 'the&#xD;
main land, while at Cherbourg they could run&#xD;
directly under the walls of the fort.'&#xD;
The Leviathan no sooner found the ship was&#xD;
making for the land, than she tame into the&#xD;
wind, .and gave her first one and- then another&#xD;
broadside. But through the 'storm of iron the&#xD;
brave ship held heraay, though her spars were&#xD;
splintered, her rigging cut, her timbers wounded,,&#xD;
and her scuppers running blood from her slaugh-&#xD;
tered crew. Onward she held her course, till at&#xD;
length she had only her foremast and single fore-&#xD;
sail remaining. Yet with this squared to the&#xD;
wind, she drove forward, staggering and help-&#xD;
less, while the shores of Cherbourg were thronged&#xD;
withtcitizens; who, by their shouts, encouraged&#xD;
those on board. The Leviathan came to about&#xD;
a mile from the town, for want of sufficient depth&#xD;
of water, and lowering a fleet of boats, sent themns&#xD;
in after the ship, which could scarcely creep along&#xD;
for her wounds. 'But at length she struck the&#xD;
shore, and a score of boats from the land came&#xD;
off- to land the crew. They were soon'filled, but&#xD;
Red Hand remained last with a dozen of his men.&#xD;
"We will give them a parting salute," ha&#xD;
said, quietly.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE YOUNG FISHERMAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
The guns on the larboard battery had been&#xD;
previously shotted, and as the ship in grounding&#xD;
had swung beam on the land, her battery bore&#xD;
directly on the flotilla of boats. The latter were&#xD;
pulling in with a perseverance and boldness that&#xD;
showed their determination -to take the ship&#xD;
though she was in a friendly port; but in those&#xD;
days the privileges of neutrality were not so&#xD;
sacredly regarded by nautical men as they are&#xD;
at thepresent day.&#xD;
When the boats of the parliament ship had got&#xD;
within half a mile, Red Hand gave the signal by&#xD;
touching off the after gun with his own hand.&#xD;
The others were discharged in rapid succession,,&#xD;
and the earl, amid' the smoke, after setting fire&#xD;
to his ship, left her to  her,fate.&#xD;
&#xD;
The effect of the broadside upon the advanc-&#xD;
ing boats was prodigious ; so that it was said&#xD;
that Red Hand had slain more me i in the last&#xD;
hour of his command on the channel, than In1 all&#xD;
his fourteen years' cruisings.' Out of nine boats,&#xD;
but three reached the Leviathan, the othersbar-&#xD;
ing been destroyed by the final fire of the Royal&#xD;
Charles.&#xD;
The earl stood upon the shore apd witnessed&#xD;
with a sad heart the conflagration of his fine&#xD;
ship, as in the dusk of evening she shot up&#xD;
tongues of lurid flame to the sky, illuminating&#xD;
town and port, harbor and shore, sea and clouds&#xD;
with a brilliant flame, and night closed over a&#xD;
scene of appalling interest and excitement.&#xD;
&#xD;

I-&#xD;
&#xD;
At St. Lo the earl received his daughter, wb&#xD;
joined the cavalcade, and riding more especially&#xD;
under the care of the youthful secretary, she Was&#xD;
escorted to the metropolis.&#xD;
The subsequent events connected with the ar.&#xD;
rival of the prince in Trance, and his retiring&#xD;
and establishing a court in Holland of the nobles&#xD;
who had followed him, are such common matters&#xD;
of history, that we need not dwell upon them in&#xD;
our story, but carry our narrative forward toathe&#xD;
period when the sun of his fortunes once more&#xD;
rose above the horizon and lighted him to the&#xD;
throne of his ancestors.&#xD;
Cromwell, after an unparalleled usurpation of&#xD;
nine years, at length died, contrary to the ex-&#xD;
pectation of his, enemies, peacefully upon, his&#xD;
bed, and naming his son Richard as his successor.&#xD;
But this person possessed none of the ambition,&#xD;
or statesmanlike talents, or warlike spirit of his&#xD;
father ; and after a brief exercise of the power&#xD;
bequeathed to-him, resigned it into the hands of&#xD;
&amp;amp; parliament. England was now without a head;&#xD;
and all hearts were turned to the youthful Prince&#xD;
Charles, who still remained in Holland, where&#xD;
he surrounded himself by a brilliant court' To&#xD;
him a messenger wardespatched by the parlia.&#xD;
meant, offering to reinstate him on the throne of&#xD;
-the realm, on certain conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
THn earl and his officers were hospitably en-&#xD;
tertained that night by the citizens of Cherbourg,&#xD;
who, when they learned that Prince Charles&#xD;
had safely landed in France, illuminated theircity&#xD;
with joy ; for the French of all classes had , a&#xD;
great horror of Cromwell, and although they&#xD;
knew little of Prince Charles, the fact that he&#xD;
was the legitimate heir to the British throne was&#xD;
enough to bindto him the sympathy of the loyal,&#xD;
and, in that' day, king-loving people.&#xD;
The next day the earl, whose renown made&#xD;
him no'inconsiderable mark of curiosity, quitted&#xD;
Cherbourg 'for 'St. Lo, where his daughter, the&#xD;
fair Lady Jane, was placed for security and edu-&#xD;
cation. He was accompanied by several of his&#xD;
officers, who from thence were to accompany&#xD;
him to Paris, where they hoped to meet the&#xD;
prince, of whose safe landing at Feschamps. the&#xD;
earl had heard through Edward, who had joined&#xD;
him at .Cherbourg.&#xD;
"And what became of my brave friend Guil-&#xD;
ford ?" asked the earl.-&#xD;
"He accompanied the prince, by his request,&#xD;
to Paris. I saw them depart,.with the youth,&#xD;
and Robin, mounted 'on horses furnished by the&#xD;
mayor- of Fesehamps. Lords Algernon and.&#xD;
Catesby also accompanied his majesty; and they&#xD;
hoped to reach Paris in eighteen hours."' ' 1&#xD;

&#xD;
THE YOUNG FISHERMAN&#xD;
&#xD;
The prince, when the parliament's courier was&#xD;
snioupced, was dining at a table at'which were&#xD;
Oeatea a score of his nobles, among wiorm were&#xD;
YordAlgernon, the Scottish'lord,'Catesby, and&#xD;
last, not least, Arthur of the Red Hand, earl of&#xD;
Villiers.&#xD;
When 'the prince received the pacquet from&#xD;
she hand of Lord Rudolph, who was the mes-&#xD;
eager, his' l*ow darkened as he perused it, the&#xD;
expression of his face being all the while closely&#xD;
watched bj  his friends, who forgot the banquet&#xD;
in their anxiety to learn the news from England.&#xD;
But when he came to the close of it, a smile&#xD;
curled his lip.&#xD;
"News' from London, my lords!. You will&#xD;
excuse me while-I withdraw to give a response.&#xD;
My lord," he added, addressing the Earl of Vil-&#xD;
.   liners, "you will please retire to my cabinet with&#xD;
me."&#xD;
He also named four other noblemen, and then&#xD;
rising, he took his leave and departed from the&#xD;
banquet-room. Upon reachin   his cabinet he&#xD;
closed the door, but first ga  orders to have&#xD;
Lord Rudolph Vane, the courier, hospitably en-&#xD;
tertained with all honor.&#xD;
" See to it, Guilford!" he said,'turning to our&#xD;
hero, who had left the table with him at his&#xD;
'immand, aid now followed into the cabinet.&#xD;
9:Youiuajesty could perhaps hardly-appoint&#xD;
a less acceptable host to Lord Rudolph," an-&#xD;
swered-Guilford with a slight color of embar-&#xD;
ra ment.&#xD;
True-..true!i I had forgotten! My Lord&#xD;
Granville," added the prince, " I pray you take&#xD;
care of-Lord Vane's comfort. W6 must not&#xD;
treat discourteously our parliament's messen-&#xD;
"&#xD;
't- I obey your majesty," answered the noble-&#xD;
man, retiring.-&#xD;
"Now, my lords," said the king, " Hear our&#xD;
words.. The brave and loyal GeneralMonk, who&#xD;
seems to be standing just now in Cromwell's&#xD;
shoes in England, writes-me,'that now Richard,&#xD;
the son, has resigned his power,'he is ready to&#xD;
offer me my father's throne, provided that I will&#xD;
submit to and put my Signature to certain con&#xD;
ditions,-the very conditions which will make&#xD;
me recreant' to my royal father's memory,,and&#xD;
be, as it were, an-endorser of the justice of hi:&#xD;
murder. By' the soul 'of the Confessor, I wil&#xD;
bind myself to no conditions to regain that which&#xD;
is lawfully mine! !My lords, I will nevertheless&#xD;
advise with you."&#xD;
" May it please your majesty to read to u&#xD;
&#xD;
such passages of General Monk's letter-as may&#xD;
enalle us to advise your majesty"&#xD;
," Listen !"&#xD;
"'Your- majesty's restoration is the wish'of&#xD;
my breast. That achieved, I am prepared to lay&#xD;
down all power and retire to private life. I am&#xD;
at the head of an army of ten thousand men. I  *&#xD;
am encamped near London. I have power .to&#xD;
wield the parliament at my will. - As yet they do&#xD;
not suspect my intentions, which alone I now&#xD;
reveal to. your majesty. If your majesty will&#xD;
consent to the conditions herewith enclosed,  .&#xD;
can safely invite your majesty to London, and&#xD;
ensure you a public reception that will surpass&#xD;
any public entry of a monarch since the days of&#xD;
the Conqueror. These conditions I know the&#xD;
parliament will insist on, and therefore I would.&#xD;
get them from your hand in order that when I&#xD;
propose your restoration to this body, I may be&#xD;
able on the spot to shut their mouths to all ob-.&#xD;
jections. I despatch my friend Lord Vane as&#xD;
the special bearer of this missive. Do not delay&#xD;
a reply, I entreat your majesty; and I pray do&#xD;
not ,refuse to comply with conditions, without&#xD;
which I fear the restoration can never be ef-&#xD;
fected. The hearts of the people are with your&#xD;
majesty.'"&#xD;
"Now, my lords, here are the conditions." -&#xD;
The prince then read from a paper enclosed&#xD;
in the letter the conditions, which history has&#xD;
made familiar to every reader.&#xD;
"You perceive, my friends," he said, when he&#xD;
had concluded,"what Chains they would shackle&#xD;
us with."&#xD;
"Nay, your majesty;" said the earl, "but&#xD;
rather with what rivets they would strengthen&#xD;
your throne."&#xD;
" Ha ! think you that way, my lord i"&#xD;
"I do, your majesty. The people no doubt&#xD;
would receive you without conditions -. but the&#xD;
parliament must be humored."&#xD;
"I will truckle to none of them 1"&#xD;
"Nay; your majesty, but something must be&#xD;
yielded on account of 'the disjointed state of the&#xD;
l times' and the imperfections of men's loyalty."&#xD;
"Well, you no doubt counsel-wisely., Guil-&#xD;
e ford!"&#xD;
" Your majesty,"-answered the young Asher-&#xD;
s man, who. stood near an escretoire, a little in the&#xD;
l rear of the king. He was dressed in a handsome&#xD;
h suit of plum-colored velvet, richly embroidered,&#xD;
s a silken vest, and laced doublet, and his hair&#xD;
Jfiwed long 'and 'waving upon his ,shapely&#xD;
s shoulders. In ,the interval of two or three&#xD;
&#xD;
THE YOUNG FISHERMAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
years since we last parted with him, a change&#xD;
has been made, not only in his appearance, but in&#xD;
his position., The prince had become personally&#xD;
attached to him from the day he had assisted in&#xD;
effecting his escape from England, and gave&#xD;
him a position near his own person, as his pri-&#xD;
vate secretary, a situation of responsibility, which&#xD;
Guilford's talents, address, and--thanks to his&#xD;
mother's good education-enabled him to fill&#xD;
with credit and honor. At length he became so&#xD;
useful to the prince that the latter could hardly&#xD;
bearhis absence ; and he always consulted him&#xD;
on all matters before bringing them before his&#xD;
nobles; and after any council, at which Guil-&#xD;
ford was ever present as secretary, he would talk&#xD;
over with him the debates, and search his opin-&#xD;
ions upon what had been discussed. By this&#xD;
means our hero not only made himself signally&#xD;
useful to the prince, but as he always had his&#xD;
ear, he held an influence in the eyes of the nobles&#xD;
which gave him a consideration that even rank&#xD;
would not have gained him. If any lord had&#xD;
any suit to prefer, any scheme to forward, Guil-&#xD;
ford was first made a confidant, with the request&#xD;
tht he would bespeak'the prince in favorsof the&#xD;
applicant. The agreeable person, the engaging&#xD;
and unaffected manners, and' the elegant ad-&#xD;
dress of the young attendant of the prince made&#xD;
him a universal favorite; and even envy was&#xD;
silenced, when it 'was remembered that  the&#xD;
+ young secretary was only receiving in this favor&#xD;
of his prince ;his juststeward in having brought&#xD;
him from England 'to' France and saved him&#xD;
from his, foes.&#xD;
obhin, who had no talents for a court, and&#xD;
who had no high aspirations, after remaining a'&#xD;
few months in Paris, and hearing that the smug-&#xD;
gler who had seen him in -the smack had been&#xD;
shot,'returned to Brighttelmstone, where he made&#xD;
the heart of the widow glfad by the intelligence&#xD;
he brought of Guilford's prosperity and= favor&#xD;
with the prince. Soon  afterwards he 'married&#xD;
the pretty Anne, and taking'°up his abode in-the&#xD;
cottage, pursued the saine occupation as for-&#xD;
merly, and sometimes even going in his fishing'&#xD;
trips quite to the coast 'of France, to convey&#xD;
and ,Oceive letters that passed betweenthe prince&#xD;
and his friends in England. There were letters;r&#xD;
also, which were not strictly of a political na-&#xD;
ture; of which he was 'the bearer, inasmuch as&#xD;
they were handed hir eby the Lady Catharine,&#xD;
and addressed to ' The Rt. Worshipful Guilford&#xD;
Graham,9 Secretary to His Majesty     ri ne&#xD;
Charles."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Well, my lords, will that suit you?" asked&#xD;
the king, looking round upon each face, and&#xD;
finally resting his dark eyes full upon the face of&#xD;
Earl'Villiers of the Red hand.&#xD;
"It is as much as becomes your majesty to&#xD;
say," attswered the lords.,&#xD;
" Then1it shall go! Seal and direct itIto (en-&#xD;
eril. Monk,,Giilford. ,sow, gentlemen, we will&#xD;
return tosthe banquet-room."A'&#xD;
The king's. cheerful' countenance- as he'460&#xD;
entered the hall, gave all hearts hope ; ardatlien&#xD;
he 'said, to cheer them; 'It is good news,' ny&#xD;
friends ; the - star of our fortune ,beginsto&#xD;
brighten. Within- three weeks, if nothing'Irip-&#xD;
pens, I hope we'shall' see merry E gland dne&#xD;
moree"&#xD;
Upon hearing this-the whole ompanrofnob&#xD;
exiles started to their feet ad made the hail1%&#xD;
with three loud British hun as.  ' -  .     ,&#xD;
The banquet was once more about : i be '&#xD;
sumed, when Lord Rudolph, who was'iustd&#xD;
by the king'to be seated on his right,seein0ie&#xD;
Earl Villiers seated ne t to him, rose endtdiew&#xD;
back, clipping:his left hand upon his sword hilt.&#xD;
"What, sol How is this" demanded-'the&#xD;
king.&#xD;
"I have a feud of 'blood'yith the Earl' Vii-&#xD;
liers, and dantiot sit by him," asnswered Lord&#xD;
Rudolph,' with a fierce countenance.  "Yo r&#xD;
majesty dill°Oxcuse me.' I- will at sy' hotel&#xD;
await your'answer' to;GeneralMenk."&#xD;
With these words, he ,quiekly'itrode'out of&#xD;
the hall.                  '        .&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
"Guilford," now said the prince, after having&#xD;
got the mind of the nobles, "sit thee down and&#xD;
write to the gallant General Monk these words:&#xD;
'We, Charles Rex, having received your fair let-&#xD;
ter, give you thanks from our heart for the loyal&#xD;
spirit which hath prompted thee to make the&#xD;
offer of your aid to restore us to our throne. But,&#xD;
inasmuch as our subscription to the terms you lay&#xD;
down, which are the same in deftnce whereof&#xD;
our august father lost his head, we cannot sub-&#xD;
scribe to them in full; but will arrange these&#xD;
conditions when we -come into England, to the&#xD;
satisfaction of our parliament. We pledge our-&#xD;
selves, however, and here witness our hand, that&#xD;
we will do nothing contrary to the constitution&#xD;
of our realm. If this pledge be satisfactory, we;&#xD;
-will, on hearing from you to this effect, let&#xD;
nothing delay our return to England.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
LORD RUDOL 'H'S DATA 5DLT ACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
Tau abrupt departure of the fiery noble&#xD;
caused a momentary excitement. The prince&#xD;
looked displeased. The' earl smiled haughtily,&#xD;
and young Edward Percy, recently become Earl&#xD;
of Percy, stole out after the noble.  .&#xD;
But he had no sooner.reached the vestibule,'&#xD;
than he saw Lord Rudolph draw his sword, and&#xD;
with the flat of it strike Guilford, who at the-&#xD;
moment was walking across the corridor.. Our&#xD;
hero had remained a few moments in the cabinet&#xD;
to seal and address the letter to General Monk,&#xD;
and when he was returning to the hall, he met&#xD;
Lord Rudolph face to face. The latter, the way&#xD;
being narrowed by two columns, on recognizing&#xD;
'im ried:&#xD;
'stand aside, dog 1"&#xD;
Guilford's sword was in his hand, but recol-&#xD;
lecting that he was.the b,!ther of Lady Kate, he&#xD;
suppressed his rising resentment, and was pass-&#xD;
ingebim, when, as- we have, said, Lord Rudolph&#xD;
struck him in the face.&#xD;
",Npw, by the rood I" said young Edward&#xD;
Percy, as he beheld the blow, "if Guilford-stand,&#xD;
this, he hath caitiff's blood in him indeed."&#xD;
Guilford, however, kept his sword poittdown,&#xD;
and would have gone by him, when Rudolph&#xD;
spat upon him, accompanying the act with an&#xD;
epithetof derision.&#xD;
The forbearance of our hero was now at an&#xD;
&#xD;
end. He forgot Lady Kate's brother in his own&#xD;
insulter.. Throwing himself upon him, he took&#xD;
his sword from him and broke it upon the pave-&#xD;
ment, and then, with the eye of a lion, he&#xD;
glanced upon him with contempt, and was going&#xD;
into the hall, when the prince and several nobles&#xD;
rushed forth; having heard the scuffle.&#xD;
"What means this ? What is this drawing of&#xD;
swords in our very presence ?-The person of an&#xD;
ambassador is sacred. Guilford, you are under&#xD;
arrest 1"&#xD;
"Your majesty," said the young Earl. Percy,&#xD;
"Guilford is not to blame. Lord Rudolph in-&#xD;
sulted him, and he bore it; he then struck him,&#xD;
and yet he bore it; he then spat upon him; and&#xD;
your secretary took his sword from him and.,&#xD;
broke it under his feet, as you see there I"&#xD;
Then it is Lord Rudolph Vane who hath&#xD;
done this discourtesy," said the prince;reddening&#xD;
with anger. "My"lord, I.supposed thowhadst&#xD;
come hither to us as a messenger of peace, not a&#xD;
maker of brawls."&#xD;
" I shall not give account of my conduct to&#xD;
one who has neither the right nor the power to&#xD;
exact it," answered Lord Rudolph, haughtily.&#xD;
" This to the prince's face !'" exclaimed Earl&#xD;
Percy, with a flashing eye.&#xD;
"Nay, Edward I We can forgive this nrude-&#xD;
ness. " ,&#xD;
&#xD;
THE YOUNG FISHERMAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I would punish it, your majesty, but that he&#xD;
-bath but one hand, and it would not be taking&#xD;
hjm on fair terms," answered Edward.&#xD;
Lord Rudolph had kept his right arm wrapped&#xD;
in his cloak, a customn which he had followed&#xD;
ever since his recovery from his wounded wrist.&#xD;
He now thundered back, forgetting that Red&#xD;
Hand was present:&#xD;
"Thou liest 4"&#xD;
"rWhat-! But we will make thee show thy-&#xD;
self a liar 1" retorted Edward, and suddenly&#xD;
tearing open his cloak, he exposed the handless&#xD;
wrist. There was a shout of surprise from all&#xD;
around ; and Lord Rudolph, with his left hand,&#xD;
caught Edward's sword, and made a thrust so&#xD;
deadly at the young earl, that he would have&#xD;
run him through the body, but for the interposi-&#xD;
tion of Guilford, who received the point of the&#xD;
blade in his sleeve, at the imminent risk of hav-&#xD;
ing his arm pierced by it.&#xD;
"'This must be stopped, by our head !" cried&#xD;
Prince Charles. " Arrest Lord Rudolph !"&#xD;
But before he could be obeyed, the savage&#xD;
young noble bounded from the corridor, and&#xD;
leaping, into his saddle, spurred dway at full&#xD;
speed, followed by the cries of derision and&#xD;
scorn of the assembled nobles.   .       -&#xD;
"Now, by our halidom, my friends," cried the&#xD;
prince, "this unfortunate matter, if reported with&#xD;
distorted tongue in England, will do us 'a mis-&#xD;
chief and mar our fortune. He must not be&#xD;
suffered to embark and bear his' own tale until I&#xD;
have forwarded my messageo with the despatch-&#xD;
es. After my letter reaches our general's hands,&#xD;
Lord Vane can do no mischief, whatsoever he&#xD;
may say. Guilford 1"&#xD;
"Your majesty ..'&#xD;
"Prepare to proceed at once to London."&#xD;
"I am ready, your majesty."&#xD;
"Then.leave atone. You will find passage&#xD;
easy across the channel with the Delp ofgold.&#xD;
Hese is my pursb. You have the pacquet. Go,-&#xD;
and Heaven speed thee, and bring 'thee safely,&#xD;
back to us with good tidings. My Lord Villiers,&#xD;
please you see, that this hot-brained Lord Vane&#xD;
does' not take boat till Guilford hath'been full&#xD;
twenty four hours in his advance.".&#xD;
I will see to it, your majesty," answered the&#xD;
earl, who at once quited the prince's presence.&#xD;
In another hour, Guilford was on his way to&#xD;
the sea-side, mounted on a fleet steed, the letters&#xD;
of which he was the bearer being tied about him&#xD;
beneath his belt, which also held his well filled&#xD;
purse of gold.&#xD;
&#xD;
77&#xD;
&#xD;
He had to ride seven leagues before reaching&#xD;
the sea. He knew that he had ali-eady the start&#xD;
of Lord Rudolph, who still expecting to take&#xD;
back the prince's answer, had ridden to his ho-&#xD;
tel. Here he soon learned, by a visit from one&#xD;
of the prince's pages, that another bearer" had&#xD;
been selected by the prince. No sooner had'he&#xD;
been madesacquainted with the fact, than he&#xD;
called for his horse and servants, and was pre-&#xD;
paring to depart for the coast, when Earl Villiers&#xD;
met him at the door, and said'sternly;j&#xD;
"My lord, I am commanded by my prince to&#xD;
detain your lordship for twenty-four hotrs."&#xD;
"What ! am I a prisoner ?" demanded Lott&#xD;
Vane, fiercely, and turning pale.&#xD;
" That may be as you construe it. You are&#xD;
not to leave the town until twenty-four hours&#xD;
have passed."&#xD;
" This is unbearableI and you, of all men, my&#xD;
jailer !"&#xD;
"I see thou lbvest me not. But one cannot&#xD;
choose his friends or enemies in this world, my&#xD;
lord. In such cases we must be patient."&#xD;
Lord Vane looked at the earl as if he could&#xD;
annihilate him, and then returning to his apart-&#xD;
ments, paced his floor in suppressed rage.&#xD;
In the meanwhile Guilford spurred forward,&#xD;
and about' midnight, by the light of a bright&#xD;
moon, he came in sight of the shining water of&#xD;
the sea. His road terminated at a small hamlet&#xD;
composed of a few Dutch houses. lTot a vessel&#xD;
was to be seen in this harbor save the brigantide&#xD;
in which Lord Rudolph had come over, and&#xD;
which lay off waiting his return. This he was&#xD;
bound to avoid, lest he; should be too closely&#xD;
questioned, and after riding along the ecast four&#xD;
miles, he saw a lonely hut, and at a little pk-&#xD;
near it, a fishing lugger. 'This he sneeed&amp;amp;4 in&#xD;
hiring of the old man, and soon embarked'ito&#xD;
cross to England   The 'wind was lit, but&#xD;
fair, and on the fourth day he landed near Oie&#xD;
mouth of the Thames, and detaining the' boat&#xD;
for his return,he hited a horse and rode onto&#xD;
London. He reached the nmtropolis just as the&#xD;
sun was rising ol the.morning of the fifth day&#xD;
since leaving the presence of his prince. Put.&#xD;
ting up at at inn near the Parliarnent house he&#xD;
inquired for direction to General Monk.- '&#xD;
"What !"wilt thou list with him?" asked mine&#xD;
host. "It is said he pays well, though' hisarmy&#xD;

wilt see him go by here to his house, near St.&#xD;
James's palace, where he does business with the&#xD;
Parliament."&#xD;
" The Parliament are governed pretty much&#xD;
by the.genbral'g opinions, are they not'?" asked&#xD;
Guilford.&#xD;
"No, sir cavilier, for they don't'know exactly&#xD;
what' they are. The old. fellow is secret as a&#xD;
mason IBut at heart, we believe he is for our&#xD;
Charley overthe water, and would be glad to see&#xD;
the restoration."&#xD;
"And the people at large, do they, wish for&#xD;
the prince'?"&#xD;
"-Do they'? they would darken the very skies&#xD;
wiih their caps in the air, if he should come into&#xD;
London, to-day. Ah, he.is a brave prince, and&#xD;
we all love him. We dare to say so, now Crom-&#xD;
well's day is gone ; but once it was as much as&#xD;
an honest man's head was worth to speak about&#xD;
him."&#xD;
While Guilford was talking with the commu-&#xD;
iicative and loyal host, there was heard up the&#xD;
street a shouting of men, and then the clangor&#xD;
of a bugle, and a moment afterwards the cry on&#xD;
all sides :&#xD;
"Monk ! Monk ! Here comes the general I'&#xD;
Guilford's blood bounded. ;He was more in&#xD;
terested t hlan all others in his coming, and as he&#xD;
rode past, accompanied by half a. dozen field&#xD;
officers and -an orderly or two with a bodyguard&#xD;
of eighty horse bringing up the rear, he could not&#xD;
but regard with deep interest the man who held&#xD;
the reins:of the power of England, not for him&#xD;
self, but for the prince, his master.-&#xD;
Without delay he followed thetroop of horse&#xD;
and at length reached a stately: mansion, befor(&#xD;
which he saw General Monk alight and enter&#xD;
He was about,to pass forward .to ascend th&#xD;
steps, when he was put back by a dragoon, wh4&#xD;
said. -&#xD;
"Not so fast, sir cavalier. No one enter&#xD;
here without an order-no they don't."&#xD;
* Guilford looked hard in the man's face, for h&#xD;
thought he rieggnized the voice. 'But a hug&#xD;
red beard and a 1erg 'moustache defeated a&#xD;
first his scrutiny. But the _man himself aide&#xD;
him In the matter, for, after regarding Quilfor&#xD;
attentively., he said in a gratified, chucklin,&#xD;
manner;,&#xD;
"What! is not this master Guilford Graham?'-&#xD;
' Thou sayest truly," answered Guiiford&#xD;
"jbut if thou knowest me, do not speak it out s&#xD;
lod  ~&#xD;
&#xD;
"And dost thou not know me? I dare say I'&#xD;
look too warlike for you to see through me. I&#xD;
am Digby-four old friend Digbg !"&#xD;
".Toby-Digby I Verily, you are no longer&#xD;
like yourself. Thou a dragoon'?"&#xD;
" Marry come up ! What would you have a&#xD;
man do? I got my head broke so often by&#xD;
Cromwell's troopers, that I learned the knack o;&#xD;
head breaking myself. So, what -with fighting'&#xD;
I got my blood up, and when Monk's sargents&#xD;
came down to our town 'listing, I was one o' the&#xD;
first to enlist. It's a brave life, so long as we&#xD;
don't have .any fighting. But, bless us ! they&#xD;
say you are with Prince Charles over the sea,&#xD;
and he has made a lord of you ."&#xD;
"The prince can hardly make lords where he&#xD;
is, honest Digby. I am glad to see thee such a&#xD;
changed man, and doing so well."&#xD;
"What art thou doing in .England, master&#xD;
Guilford .-&#xD;
"I.would see General Monk. Can you let&#xD;
me pass, forold companion's sake'&#xD;
" Marry, that will I. Go in ; and when thou&#xD;
hast done thine errand, wait till Iam off guard,&#xD;
and we'll haye a rare gossip o' bygones."&#xD;
With these words the trooper drewraside, and&#xD;
let Guilford pass. Going by severalofficers who&#xD;
- stood in the hall,,he came ,to an orderly, who&#xD;
e stood near an inner door, and said that he de-&#xD;
I sired to have a word of importance with the&#xD;
I general.&#xD;
t ,   Your name'?"&#xD;
d    "it is of no consequence. Say I have letters&#xD;
- to, him from France."&#xD;
t.pon hearing this, there was a murmur in the&#xD;
, hall, of surprise and expectation.from the mili-&#xD;
e tary men and others in waiting, and 'Guilford&#xD;
, was scrutinized with egnrisity'&#xD;
e    " A messenger from.France I A courier from&#xD;
o the prince I" went buzzing from lip to lip.&#xD;
S His excellency desires to 'ce you," said the.&#xD;
s orderly, re-aypearing after a moment's absence.&#xD;
Guilford, all travel-worn as he was, entered&#xD;
e- the apartment of the commanderin-chief of-the&#xD;
e army. The general bent his eyes upon him as&#xD;
t he came towards him, and then said courteously,&#xD;
d yet with animation;&#xD;
d    "Did I understand my orderly aright? D&#xD;
g you bring letters from France'?"&#xD;
"Yes, your excellency, from the price"&#xD;
" ''rorg ;his majesty I" exclaimed  general,&#xD;
; with a look of pleasure. "ut how is this?&#xD;
o Where,'is I ord Rudolph 'Vane -&#xD;
S'He arrived,.and pIgeed your' letters in thie&#xD;
&#xD;
+&#xD;
&#xD;
S&#xD;
&#xD;
prince's hands, but, when the reply which I now&#xD;
bear, was ready, he .got into, some altercation&#xD;
with some of the nobles and others,}and gave&#xD;
some offence to the prince, who intrusted the&#xD;
letters to me, who hold' the place of his private&#xD;
secretary."&#xD;
" You'ai-e thenSir Guilford Graham ?"&#xD;
"At your excellency's service," answered our&#xD;
hero, as.he placed the'pacquet, which ie had by&#xD;
this time unbuckled from his girdle, in the gen-&#xD;
eral's hands:&#xD;
"I axe glad to see you and to know you. I&#xD;
have heard how the prince owes hisescape from&#xD;
England to your. undaunted courage and con-&#xD;
stat devotion.ntd '"&#xD;
Thus speaking, the general broke the seal of&#xD;
the letter and read it.. Guilford, who hadbeen&#xD;
at Paris knighted by the prince, in token of his&#xD;
gratitude, and who .also, at the same time, had&#xD;
received from thedrench king the' order of a&#xD;
chevalier, now marked closely each change in&#xD;
the expression of General Monk's countenance.&#xD;
Having penned the letter himself,he knew every&#xD;
line of it, and could clearly distinguish what the&#xD;
sentences were at which he frowned, and those&#xD;
which seemed to give him pleasure. At length&#xD;
he turned towards the secretary; and with a&#xD;
mixed expression of dissatisfaction and pleasure,&#xD;
he said :&#xD;
"Sir Guilford, do you know the contents of&#xD;
this letter'?"&#xD;
" I do, your excellence."&#xD;
"I am sorry the prince refuses to sign the&#xD;
cotditions, but it cannot be helped. We.must&#xD;
do as well as we can with what he says. It may&#xD;
satisfy the Parliament. But how left you the&#xD;
princee ?"'&#xD;
In good health, your excellency."&#xD;
"And the -arl Villiers, washe well? and&#xD;
the Barons Algernon and Catesby, and also my&#xD;
lord of Percy'?"&#xD;
" I left them all well, your excellency."&#xD;
"I hope soon to see them with their royal&#xD;
master all in England. What day did you leave&#xD;
the prince'?"&#xD;
"This is the fifth, your excellency."&#xD;
"You have made despatch. The Parliament&#xD;
is now in session. I am going thither. You&#xD;
must accompany me, Sir-Guilford. I will make&#xD;
known to them that the prince has sent a mees-&#xD;
senger to them."&#xD;
-"Yes, 'your excellency. There are duplicates&#xD;
of the letter you have, one addressed to yourself,&#xD;
andh other inscribe, as you perceive, to the&#xD;
Parliament."&#xD;
&#xD;
" This is very good. The seal remains an-&#xD;
broken, and it is addressed to the Parliamer t&#xD;
I will take you with me at once to the-hall.&#xD;
Your presence will 1o a great deal, as 4a courier&#xD;
from the king."&#xD;
The general then left the apartment, and&#xD;
passing though the saloon where his staf'were,&#xD;
called, " To horse 4"&#xD;
All was now excitement and .motion. Every&#xD;
gentleman hastened to his saddle. Digby, who&#xD;
resolved not to lose the opportunity of having a&#xD;
gossip of bygone times with his former acquain-&#xD;
tance, had kept a sharp eye on, the-door for some&#xD;
time. But when he saw him re-appear walking&#xD;
side by side with General Monk, and heard the&#xD;
general order horse to be brought to him, and&#xD;
saw the deference and honor which thecom-&#xD;
mander of the army paid to him, his amaze ent&#xD;
was so great as nearly to stupify him&#xD;
'Wha  aileth thee, 'manI" called'ono of h a&#xD;
comrades to him. "Are thine eyes going to&#xD;
quit thy head'? fall in with thy horse into the&#xD;
rank. Dost not hear that we are ordered to~fall&#xD;
in and trot I"&#xD;
Digby mechanically -obeyed the order., t&#xD;
he shook hisihead, and with a downcastlok,he&#xD;
said to himselfao&#xD;
"fMy gossip is all up. Master GiIlford h44&#xD;
become a great man. -,.I heard b. was alord,*&#xD;
and it must be true."&#xD;
'At the' door of the House of Commons, en--&#xD;
eral Monk alighted and entered the hall seav4 g&#xD;
Guilford in the vestibule. When  o k q&#xD;
that the Commons had still come to no dec&#xD;
and seeing that all hearts were for the prince,&#xD;
though not a lip dare utter hisname, e steod&#xD;
up and said:&#xD;

Every eye was fiyed upon ths president.&#xD;
hearts throbbed. . ith lious expectation,&#xD;
Some thought It would give them the infora&#xD;

Others, that General Monk himself .ad ta ten&#xD;

THE YOUNG FISHERMAN.                81&#xD;
&#xD;
however, soon removed all speculations by read-&#xD;
lng as follows:.&#xD;
General Monk desires to make known to the&#xD;
House of Commons that a messenger from the&#xD;
p$nce arrived in London this morning-"&#xD;
Here there was such a sensation and demon-&#xD;
strations of satisfaction so loud that the presi-&#xD;
dent could not proceed. At length, order and&#xD;
silence being in some degree restored, he re-&#xD;
sumed :&#xD;
"The messenger is the private secretary of his&#xD;
majesty, Sir Guilford Graham, and is now at the&#xD;
door of the house, waiting to deliver a letter of&#xD;
which he is bearer to the Commons."&#xD;
Upon hearing this, there was one universal&#xD;
shout that rose from the members of the House,&#xD;
-     and cries of " Admit him ! Admit him !" were&#xD;
heard vociferously.&#xD;
As Guilford entered, bareheaded, and walked&#xD;
up the aisle, escorted by General Monk, nothing&#xD;
could exceed the delight and enthusiasm with&#xD;
which he was received. The members, says his-&#xD;
tory, " for a moment forgot the dignity of their&#xD;
situations, and indulged for several minutes in&#xD;
loud acclamations of applause."&#xD;
Modestly, yet firmly, the youthful baronet, Sir&#xD;
Guilford, walked up to the head of the hall and&#xD;
placed the letter in the hands of the president.&#xD;
The hill was silent as the tomb while the letter{&#xD;
vas read. When it was concluded, or rather&#xD;
while he was reading the final sentence, all at&#xD;
once the House burst into onie universal assent of&#xD;
the king's proposals, and immediately a, vote&#xD;
was taken that the letter should be published.&#xD;
A vote of thanks was also passed to Sir Guil-&#xD;
ford ; and as all had heard of him as having been&#xD;
the person who had taken the prince to France,&#xD;
there was a twofold motive for their crowding&#xD;
around him ando.verwhelming him with con-&#xD;
gratulations. He was taken home to dine with&#xD;
General Monk and a large party of lords and&#xD;
gentlemen, and bore all his honors with a grace&#xD;
and modesty that won all hearts. The same&#xD;
evening he left London with the answer of the&#xD;
Commons and an invitation to the king to return&#xD;
and ascend the throne. The bearer of such joy-&#xD;
ful news, he could not obey the impulses of his&#xD;
love to turn aside to visit Castle Vane, and he&#xD;
hastened as fast as spur and wind could carry&#xD;
him, to rejoin his prince, and lay at his feet the&#xD;
triumphant results of his mission. Upon land-&#xD;
ing frogf- 'te fishing lugger, which had taken&#xD;
him safely back to Holland, our hero delayed&#xD;
only to reward the owrier of the boat, and then&#xD;
&#xD;
mounting his horse, which had been kept there&#xD;
in waiting for him, he took the road to the town&#xD;
where the prince held his little'court.  -&#xD;
He had not ridden, however, but a league and&#xD;
a 'half, when a woman called to him from a&#xD;
wretched house on the roadside, and, asked him&#xD;
to cone in for one moment and see a man who&#xD;
was dying.&#xD;
Prompt to obey the impulses of humanity,&#xD;
Guilford dismounted at the low door and crossed&#xD;
the threshold. By the light which came in from&#xD;
a smali square window above a miserable truckle&#xD;
bed, he saw to his amazement, Lord Rudolph,&#xD;
lying. and in the last extremity of life. Upon&#xD;
seeing him thus prostrate, all resentment fled&#xD;
from Sir Guilford's bosom, and he spoke to him *&#xD;
in the kindest manner, and asked what he could&#xD;
do for his repose of mind ; for he remembered&#xD;
Lady Kate, and that this was her brother. .&#xD;
No sooner did Lord Vane hear Guilford's&#xD;
voice, than he opened his eyes and fixed them&#xD;
glaringly upon him.&#xD;
"What art thou come for!, Thou, of all,&#xD;
men !" he said, gasping. "Bring the Red Hand,&#xD;
and then I shall be well attended."&#xD;
"My lord, I am your friend ! Can I serve&#xD;
you!"&#xD;
"Who art thou ?"&#xD;
" Guilford Grahanm."&#xD;
"Yes. A knave ! Thou wouldst rob me of'&#xD;
my sister ! Thou hast bewitched her-thou and&#xD;
thy .mother ! given her love portions ! Avaunt !&#xD;
I despise thee ! I spue at thee!l"&#xD;
"I am sorry, my lord, to see you lying here&#xD;
in this condition. How has it occurred !"&#xD;
But the nobleman had exhausted his strength&#xD;
in his last efforts to speak, and lay panting and.&#xD;
glaring fiercely at him., .-&#xD;
"His servant robbed  l shot him near by,"&#xD;
said the woman. " We found him.bleeding and&#xD;
insensible nine days ago, and brought him in,&#xD;
where he has grown worse ever since, and raves&#xD;
and curses fearfully."&#xD;
"Yes-I have cursed thee and Lord Villiers !&#xD;
See ! One has robbed me of my hand !" and&#xD;
here he held up the inflamed stump of his wrist,&#xD;
and shook it at Guilford; "and the other .has&#xD;
robbed me of ihy sister !"&#xD;
"My lord, you should cease to think of wa iy&#xD;
matters," said Guilford, kindly. "Turn your&#xD;
thoughts heavenward, for methinks .that thou&#xD;
hast not many minutes to live."&#xD;
.  "And these I will spend in cursing thee, and&#xD;
t telling thee how I hate thee. Thou a baronet!f&#xD;
&#xD;
Thou a prince's confidant ! Thou take my&#xD;
place as courier to the Parliament. I spit at&#xD;
thee ! 'Go and tell Red Hand the robber that I&#xD;
spent my last breath in cursing him and thee !"&#xD;
"My lord, I implore-I entreat, for thy&#xD;
sister's sake, make thy peace with Heaven "-&#xD;
But Guilford paused and said no more. The&#xD;
fallen jaw-the set eyes-the motionless face-&#xD;
all told him that death had claimed his soul. -&#xD;
"Poor man !" said the woman, "he is out of&#xD;
his misery's&#xD;
" Poor man !" ejaculated Guilford, "Ifear me&#xD;
he has but just entered upon his misery."&#xD;
Then reflecting upon the wonderful train of&#xD;
circumstances that had brought him to be pres.&#xD;
ent at the death-bed of Lord Rudolph, he gave&#xD;
directions to the woman about the care of the&#xD;
body, and'remounting his horse, galloped on to&#xD;
the next village. Here he laid the matter before&#xD;
the mayor, and left with him gold to have the&#xD;
body properly prepared to send to- 'England.&#xD;
Having performed this duty, which both love for&#xD;
Lady Kate and humanity prompted, he hastened&#xD;
forward on his important.mission..&#xD;
Upon reaching the palace of the prince, his&#xD;
majesty was pacing up and down the corridor,&#xD;
with Earl Villiers in conversation, while several&#xD;
noblemen were lounging near in groups. No&#xD;
sooner was the rapid rider'recognized'to be Sir&#xD;
Guilford Graham, than his name was.repeated&#xD;
by twenty voices, and Charles,. stoppingiin his&#xD;
walk, waited to receive him, :,with his ,mWd&#xD;
extended in welcome. Passing by the eager&#xD;
nobles, Sir Guilford reached the king, and drop-&#xD;
ping on one knee, kissed his 'hand, and .then&#xD;
placed in it the letter of the Commons. The&#xD;
king tore the seal, and first read half through it&#xD;
to himself, when, seeing that it was all good&#xD;
. news, he read it aloud:&#xD;
&#xD;
" Therefore, we, the Commons of England&#xD;
do accede to your majesty's propositions with&#xD;
joy, and do invite your majesty to return to&#xD;
England and ascend the throne of your fathers,&#xD;
*nd we will ever be your majesty's loyal and&#xD;
faithful subjects, and ever pray for the health and&#xD;
life of your majesty as in duty bound."&#xD;
"First, let me embrace thee, my trusty friend&#xD;
and welcome bearer of such good tidings," cried&#xD;
the king, with tears in his eyes, clasping Guil-&#xD;
ford to his heart before all his nobles, while they&#xD;
rent the air with acclamations of joy, such as&#xD;
the Dutch palace and the honest Dutch people&#xD;
had never witnessed before. The earl also em-&#xD;
braced Guilford, and so did Edward, Earl of&#xD;
Percy. That day and night were passed in the&#xD;
most pleasurable enjoyment, and in the reception&#xD;
by the king of the congratulations of the author-&#xD;
ities of the town.&#xD;
-In a few days afterwards, King Charles and&#xD;
full two hundred lords and gentlemen left the&#xD;
town for the coast in an imposing cavalcade.&#xD;
Here a ship of war, the very Leviathan whkf'&#xD;
had been so:near capturing him, but which ba&#xD;
now changed masters, was waiting to receive&#xD;
him by the order of the Commons, and beanhim&#xD;
to the shores of England.&#xD;
:  On the twenty.ninth! of May, 166o,o Charles&#xD;
entered London," says the history ofthat event,&#xD;
"-on his birthday. An innumerable conepo rie&#xD;
sof people Jined the way wherever he passed,,ad&#xD;
rent the air with acclamations. The'very skyf&#xD;
was darkened:withthe caps of the people, an&amp;amp;&#xD;
rent with their shouts of welcoxrie. They had&#xD;
been so long distracted by factions And'tyranhies,&#xD;
they .rejoiced with unusual enthuslasm,:tqsee&#xD;
the king once more seated in security  . upon his'&#xD;
throne."&#xD;

THE inhabitants of the little' fishing 'port of&#xD;
Brighthelmstone were one morning thrown -into&#xD;
no little emziterment bytlhe arrival of a. brigantine&#xD;
in the port, the sails ofwhich were: shrouded in.&#xD;
blackand the flag wreathed with 'crapewhile&#xD;
festoons , of it ,hung front mast : to 'aust. At&#xD;
length a boat landed;.and fremthersailors; after&#xD;
the ofmcer bad proceeded, to Castle Vane, the&#xD;
good folks learned that it contained the body of'&#xD;
Lords Rudolph whohad been.muidered in: Hol&#xD;
lanl and for who5s body 'the nariquis, his&#xD;
father; had sent.  .&#xD;
A procession of boats escorted it to the land-&#xD;
ing below the castle, where it was received by&#xD;
the father of the young nobleman. The same&#xD;
evening it was placed in the family vault, and&#xD;
the ensuing moi-ning, the brigantine, firing a&#xD;
requiem of minute guns, slowly departed sea-&#xD;
ward.&#xD;
" This attention to the obsequies of my mis-&#xD;
guided son, I learn, from a note from Earl Vil-&#xD;
liers," said the marquis to his daughter, as they&#xD;
sat together in his cabinet, talking of the dead,&#xD;
" we owe to a Sir Guilford' Graham, the king's&#xD;
private secretary. Hast thou ever heard of this&#xD;
knight, my child, and knowest thou why he took&#xD;
this pains to honor my son ?"   _&#xD;
Lady Catharine's heart beat rapidly. She&#xD;
colored, and was about to make some confused&#xD;
reply, when he further added:&#xD;
&#xD;
" The Earl Villiers further says in his note&#xD;
that the king will hold a 'grand levee at the&#xD;
palace on the first Wednesday of next month&#xD;
and that he desires that I should be present, and&#xD;
accompanied by thee. But-"&#xD;
'"Buy what, dear fatherI"&#xD;
't bNecomes-us to mourn for Lord Rudolph.&#xD;
"'Yet -we need' not enter intothe festivities.&#xD;
All :t1le friends of the king are, hastening r'to,&#xD;
Londdn'to do him homage."&#xD;
"True; and as Lord Rudolph was of the op-&#xD;
posite'side, I shall be looked to 'to make a&#xD;
more particular eqiressiOn of attachment to tlye&#xD;
crown."&#xD;
"You will then go, dear father ?'.&#xD;
"Yes. You may have everything ready."&#xD;
This permission filled the bosom  of Lady&#xD;
Catharine with joy. She was young, beautiful&#xD;
and gay, and desired to see something of the&#xD;
world from which she had been so long shut&#xD;
out.&#xD;
"Besides," said she, "I shall see Guilford in&#xD;
London, for I learn he is in high favor with the&#xD;
king, and honored and loved by all men."&#xD;
With a happy heart the charming countess&#xD;
left her father to make preparations for the com-'&#xD;
ing visit to court.&#xD;
At length the eve of the great day of the&#xD;
king's banquet and levee arrived. London was&#xD;
&#xD;
THE Ot Nd FISHERMAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
crowded- with the nobility and their families.&#xD;
One spirit  of satisfaction and delight pervaded&#xD;
all men'es minds.&#xD;
The Marquis of Vane and his daughter were&#xD;
at the mansion of the Earl of Villiers as his&#xD;
guests. The daughter of the earl, the fair Lady&#xD;
Jane, shone with surpassing radiance abbve 'all&#xD;
other maidens save Lady Kate. The two became&#xD;
very intimate, for they had known each other in&#xD;
earlier years.&#xD;
"And you are to marry to-morrow the hand-&#xD;
some Earl of Percy, fair Jenny ?" said Lady&#xD;
Catharine-to her, friend, as she was arranging a&#xD;
circlet of bridal dialnopds.&#xD;
"Yes ; and I am told' by my father that yOu&#xD;
are to marry.the brave Lord Astley."&#xD;
"Lord AstleyU! I never saw hi I" answered&#xD;
Lady Kate;-with great positiveness:&#xD;
." Well, that is odd. Both my dear Edward&#xD;
and my father told me to-dsy thatlyou were to&#xD;
marry the noble Guilford, Lord Astley."&#xD;
"Guilfod, ,0o you :ay his name 'is?"'&#xD;
" Yes; but why do you blush so ?"&#xD;
"Did I "&#xD;
"Indeed, yourface tells the truth. So we are&#xD;
to have'a Lady Astley to-ihorrdw'ft the palace,&#xD;
as well as Lady Percy ?"&#xD;
"I aestre you, dear Jenny, it'is'a mistake' I&#xD;
do not know IJord Astley. I only was surprised&#xD;
at'the coincidence of a name."&#xD;
At thip inoment Red Hand, the tall and stly&#xD;
earl, came in, and'smiling upon his dknugh e&#xD;
asked "Lady Kate if she- had heard any n   s&#xD;
from court that day in particular,&#xD;
No my lord. i have not been out to day."&#xD;
"Father !' 'exclaimed' Lady Jane, "did' ydh&#xD;
not 'tell Me that Lady Kate would probably&#xD;
niarry Lord Astley to-inord w ?"&#xD;
"Yes, I think I id," replied the earl smiling.&#xD;
"'It is a mistake, my lord." I do not know his&#xD;
lordship."&#xD;
"But are you not to be married to-morrow,&#xD;
fair lady ?" asked Lord Villiers, slily.&#xD;
"How did you hear this, my lord ?" she an-&#xD;
swered, in beautiful confusion.&#xD;
" From Edward, who is an intimate friend of&#xD;
Guilford Graham, who told him, as a great se&#xD;
eret, that it was all arranged, and that you were&#xD;
to be married to him before the king's presence,&#xD;
in Westminster, to-morrow."&#xD;
"(My lord, it is true ; but not to this Lord&#xD;
Astley."&#xD;
. "But suppose--no matter. I will not tell&#xD;
what I see he has kept a secret. I wishyou&#xD;
&#xD;
joy.. You will have a, husband'so worthy in&#xD;
Guilford Graham, fair Kate, that no nobility can&#xD;
emulate him."&#xD;
" Thanks, my good lord."&#xD;
'Ah, I know all your romantic loves. Guil-&#xD;
ford, to whom I owed my life once, told me the&#xD;
whole story; and a creditable one it was to you.&#xD;
but hither comes Earl Percy. So I will leave&#xD;
him to entertain you ; forI have to attend on the&#xD;

THE END.&#xD;
&#xD;
Tr little seamstress sat alone inher chamber&#xD;
atthe hour of sunset, one summer's day, looking&#xD;
out from her half shaded window over the great&#xD;
green lawh that stretched across from the cot-&#xD;
tage in which she lived, to the pure white houses&#xD;
that nestled like so many birds'-nests, among the&#xD;
trees and shubbery, profusely growing upon the&#xD;
other side.&#xD;
The hour was the calmest nd the holiest in&#xD;
tile long summer day,-the only one in the whole&#xD;
twenty-four when Peggy used to lay aside her&#xD;
work, and sit idly by her open window, looking&#xD;
out at the fresh scene before her. Sitting idly,&#xD;
did we say ? No, no ; her thoughts were busy&#xD;
within Ar ; though she sat there alone, she was&#xD;
never -lonely. Her mind would paint for her&#xD;
pictures far exceeding in sweetness and dreamy&#xD;
beauty those before her eyes, and in her rich'&#xD;
imagination she lived .a life fewtothers %now&#xD;
aught of. She entered a' woi'ld'she could call&#xD;

branches nearer to the ground, so that she walked&#xD;
among their cool shadows, and hid her thoughts&#xD;
from the world within the quiet of their atmo-&#xD;
sphere,&#xD;
Peggy,-.-the little seamnstress,--was habitually&#xD;
a dreamer. Not that she ever let her fancy run&#xD;
wild with her reason, or suffered an oblivious&#xD;
mist to obscure from her every. dad' vision the&#xD;
realities thatcrowded themselves about her; yet&#xD;
she dwelt much in a fabled land they call dream-&#xD;
land, always happiest, and her face always beab-&#xD;

of her imagination.&#xD;
Yet the workings of her imagination were'ail&#xD;
gentle, and they threw such a holy light about&#xD;

Her form was delicate and fragile. She was&#xD;
an orphan, and had for many years been so ;&#xD;
and when she tripped gaily along on the fresh,&#xD;
green sward from house"to house, or stopped by&#xD;
the garden wall to-pluck an ambitious 'rose that&#xD;
had climbed just high enough to peep over into&#xD;
the street and get a look at the outer world, peo-&#xD;
ple all thought, "Ah, how happy we.should be,&#xD;
could we only enjoy what little Peggy Dawson&#xD;
does I" No one ever imagined that she couldbe&#xD;
any the less happy, because she did not have a&#xD;
large surplus of this world's goods of which slye&#xD;
might boast ; no one ever thought, in thinking&#xD;
- ofher, that the possession of money, and the long-&#xD;
ings and cravings after happiness, had aught to&#xD;
do with each other.&#xD;
For some five or six years, the little seamstress&#xD;
had now been at her occupation. In its rounds&#xD;
she found enough work with which to satisfy her&#xD;
wants, and leisure enough to gratify her most&#xD;
romantic desires. We say romantic, because we&#xD;
mean romantic. In fact, and to. eoncehl the&#xD;
truth no longer, Peggy Dawson was a romantic&#xD;
girl, so far as the, estimation of the village was&#xD;
concerned. She was romantic to them, because&#xD;
their optics were not suited to the inspection of&#xD;
her fine nature. 'Whenever she left her work at&#xD;
evening or intruded some little upon its exac&#xD;
tions at early morning, that she might r o and&#xD;
perform with her blessed mite, some ch Writabl&#xD;
deed among the poor, people generally were to&#xD;
apt to associate her charities in their minds witl&#xD;
their own sordid and selfish eilpulations. The3&#xD;
thought she visited the poor that she might pos&#xD;
sibly be the gainer in the end, by an exhibitio&#xD;
of hercharities. They set a pecuniary price of&#xD;
her every good, deed and -lind and affectiouat&#xD;
expression, as if she allowed her soul to chaffe&#xD;
in coldness about the commonest charities tha&#xD;
so felicitously illustrate the history of some mem&#xD;
bers of the greatahuman family. No-no ! non&#xD;
of them understood righly the heart of the little&#xD;
seamstrels,-r-albeit they all envied her hersmi&#xD;
ing countenance, her airy walk, and the pus&#xD;
happiness that -always seemed to encircle hi&#xD;
like a dreamy halo. Little'Peggy Dawson wi&#xD;
much more of a character in her native villas&#xD;
than mauy--many others, whose worldly circus&#xD;
stanceswere far better. .&#xD;
The seamstress, we said, sat all alone in hit&#xD;
-little chambers on the-aummer evening .to whit&#xD;
we Faye made reference, resting her chin upo&#xD;
the.palm of her left hand, and her elbow up&#xD;
the window-sill, thinking over the good in h&#xD;
&#xD;
)AWSON     -&#xD;
little world that was yet left undone, and trying&#xD;
to project much more kindness that remained to&#xD;
be done, while the slanting rays of the setting&#xD;
sun streamed through the leaves and the shub-&#xD;
bery into her room, when she thought she heard&#xD;
a light step at her door. ,   -&#xD;
She had but little company there, and what&#xD;
she did have, were mostly of that kind that called&#xD;
not for' any social purpose, but to transact ne-&#xD;
cessary business, or attempt to pry into her se-&#xD;
crets.&#xD;
"Come in !" sweetly called out the voice of&#xD;
the seamstress.&#xD;
The door, slowly and carefully opened, and the&#xD;
lady with, whom she boarded entered the room,&#xD;
holding a paper in her hands.&#xD;
"1I thought you might be lonely this evening,&#xD;
just as twilight was about to come on," said&#xD;
Mrs. Gray ; " and so I came in to sit a few min-&#xD;
utes with you. This is a lovely evening, Peggy,&#xD;
isn't it ?".&#xD;
"O, yes indeed," responded the little seam-&#xD;
stress, her eyes ever open to catch the glorious&#xD;
' sights of beauty that nature spreads out so lib-&#xD;
erally before us; "yes, indeed; I enjoy the cool&#xD;
f evenings so much ; they remind me so much of"&#xD;
t heaven'! There is such a quiet, too, in the air,&#xD;
- that I almost breathe more softly, for fear of dis-&#xD;
turbing th calm thoughts that crowd upon my&#xD;
e mind, at this time."°&#xD;
o   " You enjoysitting atyour window, I suppose,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Gray.&#xD;
y    " Indeed I do," said Peggy ; the little world&#xD;
before it only suggests the thoughts of another&#xD;
a world beyond these tees and-that line of sky;&#xD;
n and I grow more happy in thinking of the clear&#xD;
e skies, and cool shades, and gentle winds that will&#xD;
r greet me in that other world beyond l''&#xD;
t  " Here is the paper from Bostow, to-day," said&#xD;
a- Mrs. Gray; "I thought that perhaps you might&#xD;
e like toget alook at it: .you know it's little plea-&#xD;
le sant to know once in a while, in a quietlittle vil-&#xD;
1- lage like this, tliat there is a worldoutside of us,&#xD;
re where other people lives and labor, and die, all&#xD;
er unknown to us.",&#xD;
as   Peggy's father had been a sea-captain. He,&#xD;
ge had a son and a daughter, Willlkm and Peggy.&#xD;
a- He died, leaving both his children with no money,&#xD;
afterhis.own debts were liquidated, andhad given&#xD;
er up in fact all hopes, when he lay on his death-&#xD;
ch bed;'that William was then alive.  ,&#xD;
n-   William went to sea a couple of year before&#xD;
on his-father's death ; and as no-tidings had reached&#xD;
eit his friends concerning him singe his departure, it&#xD;
&#xD;
87&#xD;
&#xD;
was the universal belief that he had been lost, at&#xD;
least, Peggy thought that she~had not anear rela-&#xD;
tivelivingn the world. The few letters of- his&#xD;
which she had in her possession, were letters he&#xD;
had written her after leaving his parent's roof,&#xD;
and while waiting the approach of the day on&#xD;
which he was to sail. These she treasured like&#xD;
rare jewels, and continually read them, morning&#xD;
and evening, day and night, as if they could afford&#xD;
a gleasm of real, heartfelt consolation to the poor,&#xD;
lonely orphan girl.&#xD;
Mrs. Gray sat some time with Peggy. When&#xD;
she went down again, Peggy took up her paper,&#xD;
and commenced glancing it over.   All that&#xD;
lookedlike news, especially shipping news, she&#xD;
devoured with eager interest. ' Then she looked&#xD;
in the'list of deaths, and then ran her eyes over&#xD;
the chapter of accidents and incidents. But no&#xD;
tidings from any one bearing the name of Wil-&#xD;
liam Dawson ; not a single- solitary syllable.&#xD;
Had the busy world forgotton him ? . Had he not&#xD;
a place with other men upon its theatre? Were.&#xD;
not his services as valuable as those of other&#xD;
men ?-she reasoned to herself. Yes, Peggy;.&#xD;
you reasoned rightly, because you only obeyed&#xD;
the human rules of reasoning ; you loved a lost&#xD;
brother, and that brother was as dear'to you as&#xD;
others',relatives are totheir hearts I&#xD;
Finally the little seamstress cane to the column&#xD;
of advertisements -headed " wants." Not that&#xD;
she thought that any one' in the outer world,&#xD;
away froi her quiet little village green, could be&#xD;
in want of services she might better render than&#xD;
any other person ; but because only she wished&#xD;
to learn what people were doing, and how they'&#xD;
were living, and 'what their occasional wants&#xD;
might be; as if mayhap they ought, in the-nature&#xD;
of things, Itobe any different from the wants of.&#xD;
those who do not live in. large cities, but are&#xD;
hedged in by the rows of elms and maples that&#xD;
set the limits to their village, and by the indis-&#xD;
tinct line of sky that bounds all the practical-&#xD;
world with which they have'any acquaintance.&#xD;
As she read and read along, her eye kindled&#xD;
at reading the following advertisement:--&#xD;
" WAnnD.T-Nine or ten active 'and skilful&#xD;
females, as seamstresses in alarge establishment,&#xD;
to whom the most liberal wages will be given, if&#xD;
they can be permanently hired. Apply at once&#xD;
ant o. -H       street, Boston."&#xD;
-Apply at once I" repeated Peggy, after read-&#xD;
ing it overto herself. "i wonder if I could do&#xD;
any'better there than -herein this little village.&#xD;
Myearnings here are very small;:and thoughto.&#xD;
&#xD;
PEGGY DAWSO.&#xD;
&#xD;
be sure, I get myself a living, and have -a mite&#xD;
for making glad the'hearts of others, stillI have&#xD;
a mind to go to the city and see if I cannot do&#xD;
better there. They always say that better wages&#xD;
are paid, there ; and I do -not believe that my-&#xD;
expenses would be much more than they ate&#xD;
here."&#xD;
' \So she mused ; sand so she was -musing with&#xD;
her paper lying in her lap, and her head resting&#xD;
on her hand, while she sat gazing out from hey&#xD;
window upon the green, when we caught glimpses&#xD;
of her through the deep shubbery that h'alfeon-&#xD;
cealed her.&#xD;
We thought her an uncommonly beautiful&#xD;
girl. The rose was on her che~e, and the light&#xD;
lay hidden in her sparkling eye.- Her long, raven&#xD;
locks fell in rich and luxurious ringlets over her&#xD;
fair shoulders, looking-themselves surprised that&#xD;
they should be permitted to come in contact with&#xD;
such marble whiteness. There was a classic shape&#xD;
to her head that one could not but observe at-firet&#xD;
sight. In fine, she was evidently a creature&#xD;
formed for a higher and better destiny than the&#xD;
drudgery of the workshop.&#xD;
The little seamstress lay awake long after she&#xD;
had retired that night, thinking of the prospects&#xD;
of a city life. Already she had:counted her&#xD;
whole annual receipts, and if anything, s great&#xD;
deal more too, and hil gone into a careful arith-&#xD;
metical computation of al. her increasing-expen.&#xD;
ditures. She thought that she could do'better in&#xD;
the city, and full of the thought, she composed&#xD;
herself for a night's sound sleep. But sleep was&#xD;
a long time coming. Her eyes were never in-&#xD;
clined to be wider opened, and her brain never&#xD;
seemed to be so busy with its plot and plans as.&#xD;
then. She had pretty much made up her mind,&#xD;
in fact, before she could get 'to sleep,.that on the&#xD;
next day but one after, she would get into the&#xD;
morning stage, and without itnparting a knowl-&#xD;
edge of her errand. to any one, would settle the&#xD;
question of moving permanently, by going di-&#xD;
.rectly to see the advertiser at his own establish-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
When the morning of the day came on which&#xD;
she was to stgrt, she was stirring early in her&#xD;
little chamber; the windows were wide open,&#xD;
and the room all placed in perfect order long&#xD;
before the hour for breakfast. Her reticule was&#xD;
crammed -full of the many small notions 'for&#xD;
which she thought she might possiblijhave some&#xD;
use before her return, and her travelling:dress&#xD;
never seemed to fit so snugly to her neat little&#xD;
form before.&#xD;

88                     PEGGY DAW ON&#xD;
&#xD;
Presently the sharp crack of the coachman's&#xD;
whip sounded.under the old elms.on the green,&#xD;
and the coach-wheels were making their marks&#xD;
in the soft award-in front of the door of the cot-&#xD;
tage. The door of the coach flew open,.the steps&#xD;
were piled down, Peggy with her reticule, was&#xD;
inside, and with another crack of the drivier's-&#xD;
long lash, all, were rolling smoothly away to-&#xD;
wards athe great metropolis.&#xD;
- This was the source'of new life to the feelings&#xD;
of the little seamstress,--this riding off at early&#xD;
morning in the mail coach. She had been used&#xD;
to sit all the long day alone, seeing no change,&#xD;
nothing to excite her spirits, having nothing&#xD;
broken or uninterrupted in her prospect to look&#xD;
-     at. She grew tired with the monotony, or at&#xD;
least she thought she had sometimes felt tired of&#xD;
it, when she looked back at it from her seat in the&#xD;
each, just as it was, day after day, and week&#xD;
after week, the same constant round of occupa-&#xD;
tion,--no rest,-.no change.&#xD;
How-her spirits danced with the motion d% the'&#xD;
coach, as she rolled swiftly by sweet little cot-'&#xD;
tages,- all hedged about with roses and haw-&#xD;
thorn, and snuffed up the air that was so deeply&#xD;
laden with the fragrance of the lilac blossoms&#xD;
held out.like huge bouquets, by the clumps of&#xD;
bushes that stood in almost every yard! What&#xD;
a different life'she thoughthe was in, and how&#xD;
strangely new looked tge faces by the road-side,&#xD;
that she had seen daily in the village, but had&#xD;
thought little of ! She became delighted with&#xD;
her. ride, and almost-wished that she could ride&#xD;
in a good, large, rocking mail-coach every day&#xD;
of her life. She even ceased wondering why it&#xD;
was that so many people travelled about as they&#xD;
did.' She for one, in the exuberance of her de-&#xD;
light, thoughtsheshould like to travel all the time.&#xD;
And so thinking, on she went at a rapid pace to&#xD;
Boston.&#xD;
-      She called duly on the person who had inserted&#xD;
his advertisement in the paper for seamstresses,&#xD;
and found, to her surprise, that the wages he.&#xD;
offered were even better than she had at first&#xD;
dared to imagine. It took her not long to de-&#xD;
cide .in the matter, and in less than half an&#xD;
hour's time she had engaged herself to the pro-&#xD;
prietor -fghe establishment as seamstress in his&#xD;
employ. She was to come to Boston the first of&#xD;
the next week.,,&#xD;
When she-returned to the village that night,&#xD;
she narrated all her success, perhaps giving it as&#xD;
much of the coloring as a feeling of self-satisfac-&#xD;
tion generally allows one to give to his or her&#xD;
&#xD;
narrations, and setting'more than one to won-&#xD;
dering how she happened to be so successful&#xD;
at the first trial. But no matters Peggy had&#xD;
procured herself :an excellent place, and was to&#xD;
leave all her friends behind her on Monday.&#xD;
Monday morning at last came. ' She sat long&#xD;
and silent at her little chamber window on that&#xD;
morning, for it was the last she should spand in&#xD;
the village for she could not tell how long  As&#xD;
she cast her eyes over the neat door-yard,, filled&#xD;
up as it were almost with all sorts of beautiful&#xD;
shrubbery, and stretched her gaze over the dew-&#xD;
begemmed lawn, on which, in her innocent child-&#xD;
hood, she had sported so many hours, the crystal&#xD;
tears welled their unbidden way up, and ob-&#xD;
scured as with a liquid veil the entire prospect.&#xD;
She did not think she could have loved any&#xD;
place so well. The people looked dearer to her&#xD;
than ever, as they stepped across the green, al-&#xD;
though many of them had been wont to pass her&#xD;
windows from day to day, almost unnoticed by&#xD;
her. Then she began to realize what it was to&#xD;
love home.&#xD;
The next day she was at her work in Boston,&#xD;
trying, by every means, to drive away the sad&#xD;
thoughts of home, that seemed determined to&#xD;
crowd themselves upon her. It was severe work?!.&#xD;
but she accomplished it. Each day she felt more&#xD;
at ease in her new situation, and 'was certainly&#xD;
made the happier by knowing that after her&#xD;
week's wor was over she could have something&#xD;
laid aside against future disasters.&#xD;
Her room in her boarding-house'seemed the&#xD;
very picture and copy of the one she had left in&#xD;
her native village. Everything within it was ar-&#xD;
ranged with the finest taste and the most perfect&#xD;
skill. There stood-her table in the middle of the&#xD;
room; there was her dressing-table beneath the&#xD;
mirror, and with the same bunch of flowers stand-&#xD;
ing in the wine-glass upon it. There hung-the&#xD;
miniature of her beloved parents,-now gone to&#xD;
their last sleep, and there was the wreathofever-&#xD;
greens against the naked wall,-the same she had&#xD;
arranged for her room in the country. Her books&#xD;
stood just in the position in which they used to,&#xD;
and her chairs stood on either side of them as of&#xD;
old. In fact, had one of her country friends&#xD;
popped into her room, she would hardlyhave been&#xD;
able to know she was in Boston, save from the&#xD;
sound without 'in the streets.  -&#xD;
The little seamstress was no less benevolent&#xD;
than she used to }e. Now she delighted herself&#xD;
with doing deeds of charity before forbidden her&#xD;
by her limited resources. When she had.got&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
*&#xD;
&#xD;
through her day's work, she would go into the&#xD;
street, and make trifling purchases of some poor&#xD;
apple.woman, or flower girl, as pretext for get-&#xD;
ting from them passages of their history, and.to&#xD;
inquire into their circumstances, in the hope that&#xD;
she might relieve them in some way. Wherever&#xD;
in her neighborhood she learned that a person&#xD;
was sick, and that any attentions- of hem's would&#xD;
be likely to alleviate the suffering, and smooth&#xD;
the pillow of pain, she was ready to go. She had&#xD;
carried the title with those who knew her, of" the&#xD;
angel of the sick." Her hands were open to kind&#xD;
deeds in every sick chamber. No one ever had&#xD;
to apply to her for consolation, if she knew aught&#xD;
of their distresses.&#xD;
She was tripping gaily home from  the shop&#xD;
ona night,-it was not more than a month and a&#xD;
half from the time of her first entering the estak-&#xD;
lishnent,-when a little girl came running up to&#xD;
her side, as she went along, and said in an art-&#xD;
less voice :---&#xD;
"Please, ma'am, mother wished me to tell you&#xD;
that there was a sick woman down at our house,&#xD;
and wished yo would come over there as soon&#xD;
as you could .                  --'&#xD;
"Yes, dear," answered Peggy, when she had'&#xD;
fully comprehended the place to which she wouldI&#xD;
haye her go ; "after I have 'gone, home a mo.-&#xD;
ment, I will come right down to your mother."&#xD;
Anid Peggy hastened away'tp her quiet room, to&#xD;
put up her things and arrange the many articles&#xD;
that would from time to time get out of their&#xD;
places.'f&#xD;
In a few moments the little seamstress was at 1&#xD;
the door of the lady who had sent for her. Shef&#xD;
was a friend of Peggy, and had often ministered t&#xD;
with her to the wants of the same sick. Nhec&#xD;
knew whatiPeggy was in' the sick-room; how l&#xD;
handy she was in her every movement ; how&#xD;
gentle were her actions ; what inexpressible looks&#xD;
of thankfulness the sick had cast on her, wIllie&#xD;
she walked softly about their room; and what&#xD;
an angel people all thought her, who had seen&#xD;
her in the performance of her charities. : k&#xD;
The lady led the seamstress into the next&#xD;
room, and motioned to her to approach the bed. c&#xD;
"She 's asleep now," said the  +woman, in at&#xD;
whiper.-&#xD;
The sight was that of a woman, lying sick I&#xD;
upon a bed in the farther part of. the room.  a&#xD;
The window was open just a little, letting in' k&#xD;
only a trifle of the fresh breeze that stopped but&#xD;
a momeAt to wanton with the snow-white cur-&#xD;
tain. The sun threw into the quiet room  a v&#xD;
&#xD;
89&#xD;
&#xD;
stream of his golden rays, that formed bars&#xD;
through the innumerable motes of dust that were&#xD;
floating about above the floor. The hour was&#xD;
the holy and calm hour in which the little seam-&#xD;
stress was ever wont to give the rein to her mu-&#xD;
sings. TJe calm, the sick person in the farther&#xD;
part of the room, her suppressedrespiration, the&#xD;
yellow sunset, the feelings that came to the&#xD;
breast only at this sacred time--'all made the&#xD;
seamstress peculiarly sad and thoughtful.&#xD;
"fTell me about her ?"- said Peggy, addressing&#xD;
her friend.&#xD;
" I will," aflswered the woman. " Only day&#xD;
before yesterday, a young looking man came to&#xD;
see me, saying that he was recommended here&#xD;
by a friend of mine, and soliciting, me most&#xD;
earnestly to take him and his wife here to' board&#xD;
for a short time, or at least, until she should&#xD;
grow better. I asked him if his wife was sick.&#xD;
He answered that she was ; 'and that having&#xD;
brought her by sea all 'the way from South&#xD;
America-i forget what port' he "Said he nailed&#xD;
from-her sea-sickness had rathertinereased than -&#xD;
diminished the danger of her disease."&#xD;
" What is her'complaint ?" interrupted Peggy.&#xD;
"Her husband said that she had lokg been&#xD;
laboring 'under the' attacks of consumptiveness&#xD;
before she Came here  He married her, I believe,&#xD;
he said, in South America. She is an American&#xD;
lady, and seems rejoiced t -have reached. her&#xD;
native country again, Fearing that .she night&#xD;
not live longer than time enough to bring'her&#xD;
here, and have her -see her friends once more&#xD;
before she-died, he took passage in a vessel direct&#xD;
for Boston, and had arrived only day before yes-&#xD;
erday, when he discovered that the voyage had&#xD;
only retarded; rather than favored her conva-&#xD;
escence."&#xD;
" Hush-husk!" whispered the seamstress ;&#xD;
"she is' uneasy ; I wonder if I can do ,nothing&#xD;
for the poorwoman 2"  -                  &#xD;
" I do not know," answered the -lady ; "if&#xD;
anybody can 'do  any good in a siek-r60m, I&#xD;
know that you ban,' Miss Dawson."&#xD;
"Well, I only attempt to exercise the same&#xD;
harity with the disposition of whi 'I was en-&#xD;
rusted," answered the good'little s "red".&#xD;
"I'll tell you' what I wanted of  , Miss&#xD;
Dawson," said the lady; "but I fear it will be&#xD;
king too much of bone -who has ever been so&#xD;
kind as you have been to the sick."&#xD;
" What isitfV' quickly asked Peggy.&#xD;
" Why, her'husband and 'I took turns, at&#xD;

watchers. Were to go and get them, I'm sure&#xD;
I cannot tell. Now I thought ,that if you were&#xD;
willing to sit up the greater part of the night&#xD;
with this woman, it would be rendering me a&#xD;
very great: service, indeed ; not to speak of the&#xD;
gratification I know your many tender attentions&#xD;
would afford this poor sick woman."'&#xD;
"I'll sit up, certainly," said Peggy, in a mo-&#xD;
ment ; " I'd rather do-it than not. I'll sit up&#xD;
willingly the whole night, and-you need to get no&#xD;
one to watch with me. So depend 'upon me,&#xD;
and-I will be back soon ;" and almost in the&#xD;
middle of an intended sentence, she left the room&#xD;
and the house for her own quiet little chamber.&#xD;
" How much trouble, and trial, and sadness,&#xD;
and sickness, there is in the world," said Peggy,&#xD;
quite aloud, as soon as she had got within her&#xD;
repm andshut the door.&#xD;
Yes, Peggy ; there is misery, and penury, and&#xD;
sickness,,and suffering enough in this rough, un-&#xD;
feeling world ; but fe* there are, who, like your-&#xD;
self, are willing to condole with the unfortunate&#xD;
and bolster up thesinking spirits of the wretched.,&#xD;
God has endowed and trained-few such feeling&#xD;
souls as thine.&#xD;
Evening came.   It was quite dusk.  The&#xD;
lampswere not lit- in the streets, bt just-after&#xD;
eight-of the clock, the ,full-iced moon lifted its&#xD;
golden circle above the eastern horizon, drawing&#xD;
every triaveller's eyes toits incomparable beauty,&#xD;
and lighting up the earth with a bright flood of&#xD;
refulgent beauty.&#xD;
The little seamstress sat a few 'moments at&#xD;
her window, watching the steady tide of passers&#xD;
that set in from one end of- the street and flowed&#xD;
to the other, and musing upon the old days she&#xD;
now called happy and innocent; which were&#xD;
passed in her native village-when bethinking&#xD;
herself of a sudden of her engagement she'had&#xD;
made for the night, she hastily threw on ,her&#xD;
bonnet and light shawl, and hurried out of the&#xD;
house to the residence of the sick woman whom&#xD;
she called to see just before supper.&#xD;
She. entered the' room in cnpany with the&#xD;
lady, and walked up towards the bed. A young&#xD;
man sat by the bedsideof the sick person, hold.&#xD;
ing her ji.,=in histown. It was ier husband.&#xD;
" I h  . ased this lady to witch with your&#xD;
wife, to night," said the lady; "and can answer&#xD;
that the-care she will take of her will be perfect-&#xD;
ly gratifying to your tenderest wishes."&#xD;
".I thank the young lady, very much," replied&#xD;
the young man ; "I onlyhope that I may have&#xD;
it in my power to requitee her for ,ier kindness."&#xD;
&#xD;
" You need hope no such thing, sir," said&#xD;
Peggy, in one ofher sweetest tones; "I love to&#xD;
assist the sick at all times ; and if I can do any-&#xD;
thing,-no. matter what,-the least thing for&#xD;
your sick wife, until she recovers, sir, I shall be&#xD;
most glad to do so. I hope I really love to do&#xD;
all the good in my power, sir.r&#xD;
" God less you !" exclaimed the young man,&#xD;
warmly, showing that every syllable he uttered&#xD;
was heartfelt and sincere ; "God bless you, in-&#xD;
deed," said he.&#xD;
" Ah, yes !" faintly murmured the poor woman&#xD;
on the bed ; "I am weak,-very weak!. I know .&#xD;
I cannot live !"&#xD;
" 0, Emeline !" said her husband unhappily.&#xD;
" But, no ; I cannot expect to live very long ;&#xD;
and I would, before I depart, that God would&#xD;
bless this dear girl,'for her proffered kindness to&#xD;
me."       ,&#xD;
' "But I know he will !" answered the husband&#xD;
to his wife.&#xD;
"Yes-yes !" said the meek and resigned.wife.&#xD;
The little seamstress sat herself down in a&#xD;
rocking-chair, near the' bedside of the sick wo-&#xD;
man, and, entered into' a conversation with her&#xD;
about almost everything that- could possibly in-&#xD;
terest her, and tend to draw away her attention&#xD;
from her apparently fast sinking condition, She-&#xD;
talked of home and its greenr lawns, and high:&#xD;
climbing rose bushes. She painted, with her&#xD;
words, pictures that had hung up about the walls&#xD;
of her memory for years. She told of her early&#xD;
loves; of her endeared brother,;. of her sweet&#xD;
sisters, now resting undisturbedly beneath the&#xD;
sod ; and seemed most completely happy, when&#xD;
she was calling back to her mind again, the&#xD;
scenes of her innocent, thoughtless, joy-crowded&#xD;
childhood.&#xD;
In all these matters she found a ready listener,&#xD;
and a warm  sympathiser, in the person of the&#xD;
good little seamstress.&#xD;
Night came on. It was a still, breathless,&#xD;
cloudless, moonlight night. The young husband&#xD;
had retired to his bed with fatigue, leaving Peg-&#xD;
gy to sit up with his wife, aaci desiring to be&#xD;
alarmed at any time,when his services should be&#xD;
needed.&#xD;
0, what a time is night ! what a night above&#xD;
all others was this to the little seamstress&#xD;
There was no one beside her in the room but&#xD;
the sick woman. She had long since talked&#xD;
herself to sleep, and there Peggy sat by her&#xD;
bedside,'alone and musing.&#xD;
The moon shed-its placid light upon the floor,&#xD;
&#xD;
*    just sweeping, in its entrance into the window,&#xD;
the foot of the invalid's bed. The world without&#xD;
was all still. Not even a cart or a wagon;rum-&#xD;
bled or rattled -along the pavement, by which&#xD;
Peggy might have known that there  was a&#xD;
crowded, wakeful, gay world around her. Her&#xD;
thoughts involuntarily leapt up into the sky, and&#xD;
read upon the face of the moon the imaginings&#xD;
with which she delightedher soul. She dreamed&#xD;
herself, though she was awake. Early days, a&#xD;
father and a mother, green grasses, bunches of&#xD;
flowers, blue and unclouded skies,--all these&#xD;
shifted their sweet appearance across her memo-&#xD;
rx, like a moving panorama, and she sat still for&#xD;
- a long, long time, giving herself up to the direc-&#xD;
tion of her reflections. The stillness around her&#xD;
drove her thoughts in upon themselves, and sit-&#xD;
ting just where she did, and at the precise time&#xD;
she did, it is not to be wondered at that she re-&#xD;
verted to days long gone by.&#xD;
She thought, of a sudden, that she heard a&#xD;
scream. She started from her chair, and bent&#xD;
over the sick woman. She leant her ear down&#xD;
to her mouth ; she groaned again. Peggy&#xD;
waked her this time, so distressing was'the sec-&#xD;
ond groan.&#xD;
" What will-you have ?" asked the little'seam-&#xD;
stress, almost in a whisper.&#xD;
"What ?" asked the sick woman, more than&#xD;
hialf asleep.&#xD;
"What shall I get ,you ?" -again asked the&#xD;
seamstress.&#xD;
"0, nothing !" she faintly answered, and gasp-&#xD;
.ng as if for breath ; " I have4dreamed that I&#xD;
should be called away in a few moments,-I feel&#xD;
that I am going now ! Yes-I know I am !&#xD;
Where 's William ?" said she, hurriedly ; " call&#xD;
William! I must see him once more ! 0, how,&#xD;
hard it is to breathe ! I feel as if I was smoth-&#xD;
ering! Wont you open the window, darling ?&#xD;
I will thank you so much !"    '&#xD;
The little seamstress flew to raise the, window,&#xD;
and then without a word or a syllable further,&#xD;
softly stepped across the hall and knocked at the&#xD;
door of the sick woman's husband.&#xD;
She returned to the bedside of the invalid,&#xD;
and administered to her every little thing that&#xD;
she thought would tend to her comfort. And&#xD;
while waiting butfor a moment for her husband,&#xD;
she sat and fanned a breeze of fresh air over the&#xD;
brow and temples of the' sick woman, s she lay,&#xD;
upon the bed.&#xD;
When the young man -came into the room in&#xD;
his dressing-gown and slippers, and had learned&#xD;
&#xD;
from Peggy how his wife felt, he went up to her&#xD;
bedside, and taking her hand said:. -° . .,&#xD;
" Emeline ! Do you feel worse '"&#xD;
" 0, yes !" she gt'oaned out, in asingle breath.&#xD;
" Yes, indeed ! I feel as if I must die,:Williamn!&#xD;
Lift up the curtain of that window higher, and&#xD;
let me see the' moonlight again, for the sun I&#xD;
shall never look at even once more ! Yes,, Wil-&#xD;
liam, I must go soon ! I only wished to te you&#xD;
once more, first !"&#xD;
- "Emeline ! Emeline l" said her husband, s&#xD;
if he would chide her for her very feelings;&#xD;
"But .I cannot help it, William ; I know it!&#xD;
It is so ;-yes, yes ! Take my hand, William;&#xD;
I am growing blind ! The moon has all gone&#xD;
out, hasn't it, William ? I cannot see;-.-.tell me !"&#xD;
" No, no, my dear !" interrupted, her husband.&#xD;
" 0, 1 wish you would lay your hand on my&#xD;
heart,-it beats so ! What makes me so dizzy,&#xD;
wonder ! Everything swims to nay eyes, yet&#xD;
I know I am not blind, for I can see the moon&#xD;
shine in on the foot of my bed ; but it is paler&#xD;
than it used to be, isn't it, William ? *Put your&#xD;
cheek to mine, now, William ; 0, mine feels so&#xD;
very cold ! Is this death, William ? Do they&#xD;
call it death ? I wonder .if everybody feels so&#xD;
when they come to die 1"&#xD;
" Do not talk so, Emeline !" said her husband.&#xD;
" I shall not talk long at all, William," said&#xD;
she.&#xD;
" Emelinb! Emeline !" said her husband.&#xD;
The little seamstress sat on the opposite side&#xD;
of the bed from that on which the young hus-&#xD;
band stood, bathing the patient's temples with&#xD;
the saturated cloth she held in her'hands.&#xD;
"You'll remember, William !" exclaimed the&#xD;
wife ; " you'll remember i I thank you,-I thank&#xD;
you !" said" she, turning towards Peggy. "0,&#xD;
William! If I could only have -lived till--&#xD;
But it's all over now, almost ! The waters look&#xD;
dark, -but I can go across safely ! I do not&#xD;
fear their roaring, William ; I shall soon be on&#xD;
the other shore ! Good-by, William! Good"&#xD;
The words never were finished. They died in&#xD;
the act of being spoken. The poor woman&#xD;
dropped her lean 'and pale hands down by her&#xD;
side, as if she were all wearied out with her&#xD;
work, and quietly, and surrounded by a heaven-&#xD;
ly calm, breathed her last breath on earth,&#xD;
Her husband and the little seamstress stood&#xD;
for a long time, gazing at the lovely expression&#xD;
that wreathed the bow of the corpse, before&#xD;
either spoke.&#xD;
Then the husband turned his head away, an4&#xD;

the good little seamstress looked out through&#xD;
the window at the midnight moon,,and thought&#xD;
how soon she would be;called to lay herself down&#xD;
and breathe her life out just as sweetly.&#xD;
"She is gone 1" finally spoke the bereaved&#xD;
httsband.&#xD;
itYes, she rests !" exclaimed Peggy.&#xD;
"Who may I thank for the tender care shown&#xD;
her this last night of her existence ?" asked the&#xD;
husband.&#xD;
"I have not done, sir, one half.the good I&#xD;
wish I could have done ; but Peggy Dawson is&#xD;
always glad to succor the sick."&#xD;
"'Peggy Dawson I" exclaimed the stranger, in&#xD;
astonishment.&#xD;
* Yes,-I am she," answered the little seam-&#xD;
stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Mr SISTERs I My own sister !r exclaimed&#xD;
he, rushing to her and folding "her in his arms ;&#xD;
" I am, I am William Dawson,-your long, long&#xD;
lost brother !"&#xD;
Brother and sister,-each an orphan,-now&#xD;
embraced each other over the dead body of the&#xD;
young wife, at that calm and holy hour of mid-&#xD;
night. It was a strange place for a brother to&#xD;
find' his sister, and a stranger scene for a sister&#xD;
to witness-the death of her brother's wife. But&#xD;
that was the spot Heaven had designed where&#xD;
they should again meet after many long years'&#xD;
absence, and weep in united sympathy over the&#xD;
remains of'the dead.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER - I.&#xD;
&#xD;
Two persons, well mounted, were riding&#xD;
through the little town of Kurnbach. Both&#xD;
were young, well formed, and apparently in&#xD;
good crcumstances. From their strong resem-&#xD;
blance it was easy to perceive that there was&#xD;
some relationship existing between them.&#xD;
" This must be's lonely place to live in,"&#xD;
said the eldest, whom we will call Frederic&#xD;
Raymon.&#xD;
"Lonely enough," replied his brother Hans.&#xD;
"If I wished to turn hermit, I think I should.&#xD;
come here. But there,are other parts of Kurn-&#xD;
bach more'thickly populated than this. We are&#xD;
in the most broken, rugged,' and uninhabited&#xD;
part now."-&#xD;
"I know it; but look yonder; upon the most&#xD;
desolate spot of all stands the largest dwelling I&#xD;
have seen in Kurnbach."&#xD;
"It is probably the residence of some peasant&#xD;
who owns grounds the other side of the moun-&#xD;
tain," replied Hans.&#xD;
"If he owns lands the other side of the moun-&#xD;
tain, why did he not build his house there?&#xD;
Why should a human- creature select suph a&#xD;
spot to pass his daysaon?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"That I know not; but here is an hones-&#xD;
looking lad, let us ask him to solve our doubts."&#xD;
"Agreed. Young man, can you tell us what&#xD;
-person lives yonder in that large, building ?"&#xD;
" He is called George Beman," replied the lad.&#xD;
"What is his employment?" asked Frederic.&#xD;
" I do not know."&#xD;
"Do you not live here ?"&#xD;
"Yes, just over the hill, yonder."&#xD;
"That being the case, it seems to me that&#xD;
you ought to know what your neighbor 1)eman&#xD;
does for a livelihood."&#xD;
"He don't work, sir."&#xD;
"'Don't work?"&#xD;
"No person has ever seen him do any work&#xD;
since he has been among us, sir."&#xD;
"Then he's a nan of fortune, I suppose ?"&#xD;
"Can't tell you; he keeps his business all to&#xD;
himself."&#xD;
"What character does.he bear among you?"&#xD;
" He is kind to all, and has been known -to&#xD;
assist the poor in the neighborhood. He is rather&#xD;
retired in his habits; and to tell you the truth,&#xD;
sir, we know but little about him."&#xD;
" He is rather a mysterious personage, then?&#xD;

"That's it, sir, exactly."&#xD;
" Has he asy children ?"&#xD;
" One daughter."&#xD;
"Does he keep servants ?"&#xD;
" Only one."&#xD;
" Then there are only three persons who oc-&#xD;
cupy ~that gloomy-looking, building. -Is the&#xD;
daughter young and fair?'&#xD;
-" She is only seventeen, and the fairest maiden&#xD;
in Kurnbach. All the young men who have&#xD;
seen her have fallen desperately in love with&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"Thee re must have a care that we do not&#xD;
get sight of her," laid Hans, laughing.&#xD;
"I'd advise you to, sir, by all means; for it's&#xD;
not likely she'll take a fancy to either of you!"&#xD;
"Very flattering indeed! Perhaps you have&#xD;
made an impression on the fair one's heart ?",&#xD;
"iI dare say I might, but I don't think j shall&#xD;
try," returned the peasant, gravely. .&#xD;
" Very cool, upon-my word," said Hans.&#xD;
The peasant went his way, and the brothers&#xD;
rode on.&#xD;
"I almost wish," added Hans, "that some&#xD;
accident woutdlhappen to throw me in the way&#xD;
of yonder churl's 'dightet"&#xD;
Scarcely had Mans uttered the words, when&#xD;
his horse stprhbled, audhe was thrown forward&#xD;
oc sr his head. Freeric hastened to dismoun&#xD;
 gpto his relief. He found him insensible&#xD;
asdtunable to stand when he raised him from&#xD;
the ground. Sitting down beside him, and taking&#xD;
his head upon his knees, he chafed -his temples&#xD;
and his hands ; but he strove in vain to restore&#xD;
himnto consciousness.&#xD;
Finding.that his efforts were useless, and the&#xD;
he was losing time, he lifted his unfortunat&#xD;
brother in his arms,,.aod being a strong man&#xD;
borehim, with little difficulty, towards the dwell&#xD;
ing of George Beman.&#xD;
" HIcannot refuse to give me assistance unde&#xD;
circumstances like these, be he ever so churlish,&#xD;
said Frederic, as he toiled up the ascent towar&#xD;
the house.&#xD;
He knocked loudly on reaching the door&#xD;
'.the summons was answered by a person so ver&#xD;
different in his appearance from what he ha&#xD;
pictured, that for an inStant he was unable t&#xD;
utter a word.&#xD;
The man who produced this unexpected astoi&#xD;
ishutent was about thirty-eight years of age. H&#xD;
features and bearing, sofar from being forbidding&#xD;
and churlish, were mild, open, and even han&#xD;
some.&#xD;

"An unfortunate occurrence has made me&#xD;
intrude myself upon you in this unceremonious&#xD;
manner," said Frederic.&#xD;
"Heaven forbid that I should refuse to render&#xD;
all the aid in my power to the distressed. Let,&#xD;
me relieve you of a portion of your burthen. A&#xD;
fall I perceive-from his horse most likely;-&#xD;
bear him this'way."&#xD;
Hans was soon deposited upon a couch, and&#xD;
receiving every attention, while the domestic was&#xD;
despatched to the village for a surgeon. Under&#xD;
these kind attentions he soon recovered his con-&#xD;
sciousness. When the surgeon arrived it was&#xD;
found that his arm had been broken, and he had&#xD;
sustained other severe injuries, and that if his&#xD;
hurts healed well, and everything took a favor-&#xD;
able aspect, it-would be impossible for him to&#xD;
resume his journey under several weeks.&#xD;
"Giveyourselfno uneasiness on that account,"&#xD;
said Beman to Frederic, whom this intelligence&#xD;
affected considerably. " You can pursue your&#xD;
journey when it pleases you, and it shall be my&#xD;
care that he wants for nothing that can conduce&#xD;
to his recovery."&#xD;
P  Finding that his presence could not in the&#xD;
least facilitate the curative process, he resumed&#xD;
his journey on the following morning.&#xD;
I   Hans awoke from   a deep .sleep, which had&#xD;
t lasted nearly all day. The first object that met&#xD;
, his gaze was the figure of a foung female seated&#xD;
near his bed.&#xD;
g Hans rubbed his eyes to clear his vision, and,&#xD;
s then took a- second and longer look. The in-&#xD;
e pressions which he received from this s$$utiny&#xD;
were most favorable to'the lady in question, who&#xD;
t was wholly unconscious at that moment thatnshe-&#xD;
e was the object of so much attention. .&#xD;
,   " She's wondrous fair," said Hans to himself.&#xD;
L- "I think I have never seen her equal. What&#xD;
eyes ! what a face ' what a figure i If my neck&#xD;
r is not broken, I am certainly the most fortunate&#xD;
of men."&#xD;
d    Hans attempted to tun.to. get a better view of&#xD;
his attendant. Tbeeort produced so much,&#xD;
r. pain that he groaned heavily. The eyes of the&#xD;
'y -maiden were instantly directed towards her pa-&#xD;
d tient, when seeing his attention so earnestly fixed&#xD;
o upon her, she reddened to the forehead, and&#xD;
looked confused.  -&#xD;
n-   '4 You are \the daughter of my kind hostI_&#xD;
is presume," said Hans, driving the expression of,&#xD;
ig -pain from his features. "Do not be alarmed at&#xD;
d- my unmanly groans. I moved my arm incau-&#xD;
tiously."              -&#xD;
&#xD;
THE TWIN'BROTHERS.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I fear you are dangerously injured, sir; can&#xD;
I serve you ?" asked the maiden, timidly.&#xD;
" It was an awkward fall, but I trust my ill-&#xD;
ness will not be of long duration. A little water,&#xD;
if you please."&#xD;
t  Fairer hands never poured water for a mor-&#xD;
tal," said Hans to himself, as his gentle nurse&#xD;
filled a glass with the pure, sparkling beverage&#xD;
first used by man.&#xD;
" Thank you;, I think I shall soon be well."&#xD;
" Shall I call my.father 9' o  b   e&#xD;
Before Hans had time to reply, the person&#xD;
spoken of entered the'-room-.&#xD;
witHow fares myguest to-day?" he asked,&#xD;
with a kindly sd iled&#xD;
" He is doing, better than he deserves," said&#xD;
Hans, "and cannot be too grateful for such care-&#xD;
ful attention."'&#xD;
"The debt of gratitude will not be great.&#xD;
Some day I may take a notion to go into that&#xD;
part of the country were you reside? and break&#xD;
some of my, bones, and then it will come all&#xD;
right; though you would in that event, no doubt,&#xD;
be troubled with me longer, for being older, my&#xD;
flesh will not heal so readily as yours. It takes&#xD;
young blood, you know, to heal ;bruises, ;frac'1&#xD;
tures and contusions speedily. But I forgot to&#xD;
introduce you to my daughter."&#xD;
"  "I shallnever be}sufficiently'grateful to your&#xD;
fair daughter," returned Hans, embarrassed, heJ&#xD;
knew not why.-&#xD;
"We aI have duties tordischarge to each other,&#xD;
and I hope I and mine will-not be the first to'&#xD;
forget our responsibilities in that respect," was&#xD;
tho good natured reply.&#xD;
Days passed on. As Hans's external wounds&#xD;
healed and grew less painful, he was conscious&#xD;
of internal inroads upon his heart; which threat-&#xD;
ened to baffle all the arts of surgery and medi-1&#xD;
cine. The bright eyes and gentle smiles of Iva,&#xD;
had done their work; Hans wag enthralled. Sov&#xD;
far from wishing for a speedy cure of his broken&#xD;
bones, he heartily prayed that they might take'&#xD;
their own time, and not farce him to leave the&#xD;
dwelling of George Heman too soon. f&#xD;
It ivas with a feeling of disappointment that &#xD;
he saw his wounds healing by the "first inten- a&#xD;
t in."&#xD;
The time passed very pleasantly with our hero. h&#xD;
He had the happiness of seeing Iva every day, ii&#xD;
and of conversing wi   her. To his surprise he d&#xD;
found that the graces of her, mind 'exceeded,*if u,&#xD;
possible, the graces of her person.,P&#xD;
At length this wounds were- healed, .anl there ti&#xD;
&#xD;
was no longer excuse for further delay. Be-&#xD;
lieving that his' happiness was involved in the&#xD;
state of Iva's feelings towards him, he availed&#xD;
himself of the first opportunity to converse with&#xD;
her on.the subject.&#xD;
" Duty admonishes me that it is time for me&#xD;
to leave this hospitable roof," he said with some&#xD;
emotion. " To-morrow I shall leave you, but&#xD;
once more before I depart, I woaild attempt to&#xD;
express the grateful emotions which I feel. - Iva,&#xD;
you have been to me a ministering angel. The&#xD;
sound of, your footsteps in this room has been&#xD;
music to me. When you come and speak, I for-&#xD;
get my pain.  Your gentle smiles have done&#xD;
more for me than leech or medicament. Yos&#xD;
have become indispensable to my - happiness.&#xD;
How' can I go hence and see you no more ?"&#xD;
Hans paused to recover himself, for his voice'&#xD;
had grown tremulous. . -&#xD;
" Must you go so soon, then '" asked' Iva, in&#xD;
a voice that betrayed more than-she desired;&#xD;
" It must be thus. My hurtsmare quite well,&#xD;
and I can find no excuse for intruding myself&#xD;
upon you longer. But there :is something of&#xD;
importance which I must communicate ' to you,&#xD;
before I bid you fivoll. Iagi love you.?'&#xD;
Hans could get n6 further. iHe'stopped and&#xD;
looked at his fair nurse'; eiewas-weeping. Re-&#xD;
assured,'he sank upon his knees and kissed her&#xD;
hands. It was not Ing before he had wrung&#xD;
from her a timid confession of her love, a&amp;amp;e&#xD;
when they parted they had pledged therpselves,&#xD;
to eternal constancy and truth.&#xD;
Mans now' believed himself 'the most happy&#xD;
man in existenceand often found himself-say--&#xD;
ing, " what a fortunate thing- that my Jiorae&#xD;

A placid moonlight night fbllowedt third im-&#xD;
portant event. Hans retired to his chamber, but&#xD;
could not sleep. Putting on his clothes, he&#xD;
walked softly from the house. It seemed'to him&#xD;
hat his room was not large enough to.breathe in&#xD;
nce he had become happy in the love of Iva.&#xD;
Taking the first path that he ame to, he soon&#xD;
found himself in the shadow of some large trees,&#xD;
which he remembered often having looked 'out&#xD;
upon during his illness.&#xD;
Leaning against one of the sturdy trunks that&#xD;
ad defied wind and storm so long, he looked up&#xD;
ito the quiet sky. He had stood in a sort of&#xD;
reamy reverie for about the space of ten min-&#xD;
tes, when a sound like-"at produced by foot-&#xD;
teps caused him to gland  hastily about him for&#xD;
he cause of the disturbance. He saw distinctly&#xD;

&#xD;
a figure approaching by the same path he had&#xD;
taken.. As it advanced, and become more dis-&#xD;
tinctly defined against the shadowy objects&#xD;
around, he perceived that it was a female form.&#xD;
That it was Iva, he could, not doubt ; but for&#xD;
what she could be abroad at such an hour, he&#xD;
could not guess. She kept on, and passed-within&#xD;
a few yards of him. She did not'go far, but&#xD;
drawing her mantle closer about her, stood&#xD;
motionless.&#xD;
"She waits for some one," said Hans to&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
It was not long before another figure was visi-&#xD;
ble. s This one wore male attire, and approach-&#xD;
ing Iva, embraced her, while Hans heard her&#xD;
say:&#xD;
"Dear --" the name did not reach him-&#xD;
"you have come at last. I feared I should not&#xD;
see you."       k        .&#xD;
. " Nothing could have kept me from this meet-&#xD;
ing, save sickness or death,"'replied the other;&#xD;
and Hans imagined he saw him salute Iva's lips&#xD;
at the same time.&#xD;
The parties now walked away out of sight&#xD;
and hearing, leaving our hero transfixed with&#xD;
amazement, and pained to.tliheart. He walked&#xD;
back to the dwelling he had left with such sen&#xD;
sations of happiness, changed in thought and in&#xD;
feature. All his air-castles had tumbled down&#xD;
4    and grief, despair and indignation, arose and&#xD;
filled, their places. He sat down at his window&#xD;
and after the lapse of nearly an hopir saw Iva&#xD;
return.&#xD;
Hans threw himself upon his bed, without di&#xD;
vesting himself of clothing, and passed the mos&#xD;
miserable -night of his -life. The "idea seemed&#xD;
like a mockery of his misery, but for the life o&#xD;
ima he could not help exclaiming:&#xD;
&#xD;
"How unfortunate a thing ,that mey horse&#xD;
stumbled !"&#xD;
It is thus that circumstances change our views&#xD;
and shape our thoughts.&#xD;
It was remarked in the morning, by Lfr. Be-&#xD;
man, that Hans looked haggard and '_'i'irited,.&#xD;
as though he had passed a bad hnight.le ate in&#xD;
silence, and it was a gloomy breakfast to all.&#xD;
The horse whose clumsiness had caused his&#xD;
master so much suffering, was brought to the&#xD;
door. Hans took an. affectionate leave of his&#xD;
kind entertainer. With one foot in the stirrup&#xD;
he turned to Iva, who stood very near him, and&#xD;
said in a low reproachful voice  .&#xD;
" Iva, farewell! We meet no more. Last night&#xD;
I saw you leave the hose, and witnessed all-&#xD;
enough to prove your inconstancy."&#xD;
Before Iva had recovered from the surprise&#xD;
which these words occasioned, Hans Rayinon&#xD;
was dashing away at fearful speed ; but before&#xD;
he was out of sight, he heard a cry from the, lips&#xD;
of his fair but false one, and knew that she had&#xD;
swooned.&#xD;
George Bemnan took his daughter in his arms&#xD;
and carried her in as tenderly as he had tended&#xD;
her in childhood.'&#xD;
"My poor child !".he said, kissing her fore-&#xD;
head. "I should have thought of this. But it&#xD;
is too late now; the mischief is done."&#xD;
" Has he gone " asked Iva, faintly, looking&#xD;
vacantly intd her father's face.&#xD;
a   " Yes, my girl, he has gone, and I would he&#xD;
had never come among us.'&#xD;
-   " My father, say not thus'; he has done'me no&#xD;
t wrong. But I may not tell you all now. Prom-&#xD;
d ise me that you will be silent on this subject for&#xD;
f the present."&#xD;
"I promise."&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
&#xD;
Wa pads over an interval of one month.&#xD;
lans'had completed the object of his journey,&#xD;
and was on his return home. He had ab~tit his&#xD;
person large sums of money, which had been&#xD;
paid him ly the executor of a deceased uncle's&#xD;
will. It was dark-when he 'reached Khirnbach,&#xD;
and not being Well acquainted with the roads,&#xD;
he soon lost his way, and became entangled in&#xD;
a labyrinth of hills, valleys and mountains. At&#xD;
length the moon came up, and he flattered him-&#xD;
self that he should be able to find his way again.&#xD;
While standing irresolute, as to what direction&#xD;
would be a proper one, a man suddenly stepped&#xD;
from the roadside, and taking the horse-by the&#xD;
bit, presented a pistol to the breast of Hans and&#xD;
demanded his money.&#xD;
Hans Raymon- was no coward, and felt rather&#xD;
reluctant to part with his thalers.&#xD;
"Let me pass !' he exclaimed, sternly.. "I&#xD;
have no money to part with thus idly."&#xD;
Yourmonef !," thundered the robber. " Your&#xD;
money without delay, or I swear to you by all&#xD;
that is sacred, I will shoot you through the&#xD;
head !,                              ,&#xD;
" I don't like the idea of giving my money&#xD;
without an equivalent," said Hans, pulling forth&#xD;
a well-filled purse. As he put the purse into the&#xD;
robber's hand, he beat forward to get a view of&#xD;
his face. He nearly fell from his horse with&#xD;
&#xD;
surprise, when, as he did so, he recognized, as&#xD;
he believed, the features of George Bernan.&#xD;
Before Hans had recovered from the shock of&#xD;
the discovery, the robber had disappeared.&#xD;
Our hero sat-like one stupifed. He forgot his&#xD;
loss; he ceased to lament his thalers ; he thought&#xD;
only of the terrible 'secret he had discovered,&#xD;
The words of the peasant lad were recalled&#xD;
" He don't work, sir. No person has ever seen&#xD;
him work since hie has been among as.vr"ee&#xD;
" To-night's adventure accounts for it, all,&#xD;
His work is done under -the dark cover of night.&#xD;
The lad was right ; 'he keeps his business all to&#xD;
himself,' in reality. 0, that Iva's father shoi d&#xD;
prove to be such a man, and that Iva herself&#xD;
should prove to be such a girl. How unfortu_&#xD;
nate that my horse did not break my neck when&#xD;
he threw me over his head I"&#xD;
Filled with these gloony reflections, Hans&#xD;
suffered his horse to go forward, careless whither&#xD;
he went; foi  he was in that state of mind when&#xD;
life seems too bitter to be borne.&#xD;
Three-quarters of an hour passed, in which he&#xD;
was conscious of nothing but misery;, upon re-&#xD;
covering himself at the expiration of that time,&#xD;
and looking about him, what was his surprise to&#xD;
find himself at Bemai's door.&#xD;
" Unlucky animal!" exclaimed Hans. "Your&#xD;
tendency always hither, and always wrong.&#xD;

98                 THE TWIN BROTHERS.&#xD;
&#xD;
What new trouble have you brought me to&#xD;
now'?"&#xD;
The dumb creature rubbed his nose against&#xD;
his master's foot without deigning any further&#xD;
reply.-&#xD;
While Hans was making up his mind what to&#xD;
do, he heard some one approaching. lie turned&#xD;
in his saddle, and beheld no other than George&#xD;
Beman himself, apparently fatigued with travel,&#xD;
and somewhat excited.&#xD;
" Ah, my friend. Raymon, is it you? Why do&#xD;
you sit in your saddle like a statue'? Dismount,&#xD;
and enter," said Beman, in his usual mild and&#xD;
kindly tones.&#xD;
" I lost my way," replied Hans, as calmly as&#xD;
he could, " and my horse has brought me hither&#xD;
before I was aware of it. I did not mean to tax&#xD;
your hospitality again so soon."&#xD;
" No apologies, Mr. Raymon. Your brother&#xD;
is already here. He reached here last night,'&#xD;
was the reply.&#xD;
" He set out on his return one day in advance&#xD;
of me. But why this delay'?" asked Hans.&#xD;
" He'was robbed on his way hither last night&#xD;
and received some rough treatment that rendered&#xD;
himi unfit to go forward to-day," replied Beman&#xD;
in a tone of voice betraying no consciousness o&#xD;
guilt, or any embarrassment whatever.&#xD;
" Cool!" thought Hans, "very cool !"&#xD;
He met Iva on the threshold. She recoiled&#xD;
step when she saw him, but instantly recovering&#xD;
her equanimity, extended her hand. Hans shool&#xD;
it coldly, and passed in.  Upon scanning th&#xD;
features of Iva more closely, he was surprise&#xD;
and shocked at the change, which he beheld&#xD;
Her cheeks were very pale, and her eyes had los&#xD;
their 'accustomed vivacity. Hans sighed audi&#xD;
bly, but unconsciously ; while Beman regarde&#xD;
him with a surprised and puzzled expression.&#xD;
" Be.kind enough to show me to my brother,&#xD;
said. our hero, wishing to be alone for a feu&#xD;
-"- moments, in order to collect his scattered an&#xD;
disturbed thoughts, for the calmness and coo&#xD;
ness of his late host astounded him. To meet&#xD;
juan who had just robbed him of a large sum&#xD;
* nioney ; to meet him in his own house ; to hav&#xD;
'that nyan treat him with, such perfect self-po&#xD;
session, and-apparent forgetfulness of what ha&#xD;
just transpired, presented human nature to hi&#xD;
in a light so tnew, that he knewnot how to ac&#xD;
lie found hisjbrother Fredericcomforlably di&#xD;
pose of in a large easy-chair.&#xD;
"LAid not expect to find you here' sa&#xD;
&#xD;
" I did not expect to be here," replied his"&#xD;
brother.&#xD;
"Our entertained, ells .;p eyou have been&#xD;
robbed," added Hans.      =&#xD;
"Then he certay tells you the truth. I&#xD;
was met last night by some gentleman unknown&#xD;
to me, who, with a cocked pistol at my head told&#xD;
me, 'stand and deliver !' "-&#xD;
" I attempted by a sudden effort to wrest the-&#xD;
pistol from his hand, but received for my good&#xD;
intention a blow upon the head, which laid me&#xD;
senseless upon the earth. When I recovered, I&#xD;
found my horse near me, for it would seem that&#xD;
the considerate highwayman had fastened the&#xD;
animal to a tree, in order that I might be spared&#xD;
the trouble of a long walk. I attempted to ride ;&#xD;
a sickly sensation crept over me, and I sank&#xD;
back overpowered and unconscious. The first&#xD;
idea that dawned upon me after this, was, that-&#xD;
there were soft hands upon my head, and breath&#xD;
upon my face. I opened my eyes, and perceived&#xD;
a female form beside me, and was fully conse&#xD;
ous that some kind angel was striving to restore&#xD;
, me to sensibility."&#xD;
1   "What looked she like'?" asked Hans, ear-&#xD;
nestly.&#xD;
f   "She greatly resembled the daughter of our&#xD;
host," replied Frederick, unconscious of the pain&#xD;
his words were inflicting.&#xD;
a " Go on, brother ! go on !" added Hans, im-&#xD;
g patiently.&#xD;
k    " Well, the unknown female assisted me to&#xD;
e arise, nfaking anxious inquiries in regard to the.&#xD;
d extent of my injuries. She studiously kept her&#xD;
1. face concealed by a thick veil, the moment she&#xD;
t perceived I was regaining my consciousness ;&#xD;
i- consequently I-saw-ier features but itnperfectly,&#xD;
d but her voice was rich and musical, like the&#xD;
daughter of our host."&#xD;
"    Hans beat upon his breast,- and paced the&#xD;
w floor like one distracted,.&#xD;
d    " What ails you, Hans'? Why this perturba-&#xD;
1- tion ?"&#xD;
a    " Go on! you shall-know all-in good time."&#xD;
of " The unknown female, with the mellow voice,&#xD;
re and the face like Iva's, assisted me to-mount&#xD;
s- she then showed me. the way to George Beman .S&#xD;
d and here you see ltjIm, safe andsound, with the&#xD;
im exception of a few bruises."&#xD;
t. ",And what became of your kind angel'?"&#xD;
s-   "She vanished."&#xD;
"Did you observe the'face and figure of the&#xD;
id robber "&#xD;
"Let me consider; he was about the height&#xD;
&#xD;
of our friend Beman, I should think, and the'&#xD;
more I recall his fenturde and appearance, the&#xD;
more striking doea the -e"tparison seem."&#xD;
"Fatal coinciderice!" exclaimed Hans, bit-&#xD;
terlye He'thenTdlated.all that had taken place&#xD;
since they had parted,'concealing nothing in ree&#xD;
lation to Iva and and her want of faith, or of the&#xD;
robbery, and his suspicions in relation to the&#xD;
author of the crime.&#xD;
"sAtn unfortunate affair," said Frederic. "I&#xD;
must confess that there are just-grouns of sus-&#xD;
picion in relatiodi to Beman and his daughter."&#xD;
"And it-is that which distressed me more than&#xD;
all. You know not how deeply I have' loved&#xD;
the fair Iva. 0, Frederic, a disappointment like&#xD;
nrne is-hard to bear. Could I, believe that she&#xD;
i innocent of all knowledge of her father's call-&#xD;
ing, it woulddeprive this last blow at my hap-&#xD;
piness of half its bitterness. ' But the truth&#xD;
comes home to me with overwhelming force--&#xD;
George Beman is the robber, and his daughter&#xD;
is the female who aided you, and if the last be&#xD;
true, then she cannot be ignorant of his occupa-&#xD;
ton."&#xD;
" That looks reasonable, but all may be made&#xD;
clear yet: a more tangled skein has been un-&#xD;
twisted," returned Frederic, in the vain hope of&#xD;
comforting his brother. " I hope it was not Iva&#xD;
who assisted me, for I have thought of the fair&#xD;
stranger ever since, and Ireally begin to imagine&#xD;
that I am in love."&#xD;
"Frederic, I shall leave Germany forever. I&#xD;
cannot remain longer; amid the scenes of my&#xD;
disappointment. My property I 'leave in your&#xD;
care, only requiring that you shall remit to me&#xD;
such sums as I shall need to' supply the every&#xD;
day wants of life."&#xD;
" No; it shall not be so. I am resolved what&#xD;
-   to do; I will accuse George Beman of robbery&#xD;
Upon the highway ; and let him prove his inno-&#xD;
cence if he can."&#xD;
"Frederic, I entreat of you to be silent. I&#xD;
will never consent that the father of the woman&#xD;
I have loved, and still love, despite all that has&#xD;
transpired, be accused of such a crime. No ;&#xD;
let darkness and forgetfulness close over a trans-:&#xD;
action so foul and unfortunate."&#xD;
" Seek aninterview with Iva," said Frederic.&#xD;
"jbut -what would it avail? Nothing. It&#xD;
woufd result in pain and mortification to both."&#xD;
"It can produce nothing worse than the pres-.&#xD;
ent state of suspense ; therefore' I say, seek an&#xD;
interviewtrith your false fair one."&#xD;
"It shall be so," answered Hans, after some&#xD;
rpfieotion.&#xD;
&#xD;
Firm in' his resolve, and true to his purpose,&#xD;
Hans soon stood in' the presence' of Besanittid&#xD;
Iva.&#xD;
"For important reasons, I crave a few mo-&#xD;
ments' interview with your daughter," Said Hans&#xD;
to his host.&#xD;
"'there can be no objection to such a re-&#xD;
'quest," he replied, and bowing, left the room.&#xD;
A painful and' embarrassing silence ensued ;&#xD;
it was.finally-broken by Hans.&#xD;
" When I parted from you, Iva, I did not-ex-&#xD;
pect to see you again so 'soon; but circumstant&#xD;
ces of a -strange character have again thrown us&#xD;
under the same roof. That I have suffered a&#xD;
deep disappointment, you well know; but Iwill&#xD;
not reproach you. I sought not this interview&#xD;
.for that purpose. I will remember you, Iva,as&#xD;
we remember dreams of happiness; and this&#xD;
dream of mine has been as fleeting as any drum,&#xD;
though it was sweet ,while it held me in its&#xD;
power. I would barter all my earthly'posses-&#xD;
sions to recall that dream for a single hour."&#xD;
" Then it shall be recalled'?" said Iva, wiping&#xD;
the tears from her dark eyes.&#xD;
" Never! never !" exclaimed'Hans, in accents&#xD;
of despair. "I have not told you all-a darker&#xD;
page must yet be read. There have been two- &#xD;
two --robberies within the last twenty-four&#xD;
hours."&#xD;
Iva's face grew pale as marble.&#xD;
"Both these robberies have occurred in Rsrn--&#xD;
bach."&#xD;
Iva wept aloud.&#xD;
" I recognized the robber.""&#xD;
"Father'of all! how can I exist'?"-cried Iva.&#xD;
" I have reasons for believing that you have&#xD;
also seen the perpetrator of these crimes."&#xD;
" Good heavens ! you suspect myown father;&#xD;
but I swear to you o 'my knees, and in the sight&#xD;
of God, that he is innocent. Iva Beaman-never&#xD;
knelt to human being before, but now she kneel&#xD;
and begs of you to suspend your judgment for a&#xD;
day, a single hour, even. 'There is a secret that&#xD;
I may not divulge."&#xD;
The sobs and tears of the beautiful  ter&#xD;
stopped her utterance. Taking her cold ha ils&#xD;
in his, Hans wept, and'let his tears fall upon&#xD;
them.&#xD;
" I cnj erse you to tell the truth."&#xD;
"I will, Hans ; I am innocent, and my'father&#xD;
is also innocent. .ad you not left ne in *&#xD;
cruel haste, I would have explained all...&#xD;
are some family matters," continued Iv&#xD;
ing calmer, "which I would fain ha ke 'x&#xD;

gerot; but I feels that the time has arrived wlen&#xD;
F; muat speak} You -saw me go forth at night&#xD;
and meet a person unknown to you. That per.&#xD;
son w!        e aeje  mele attire-my father's&#xD;
brother's: hil _.And now comes the most pain-&#xD;
ful part 1my confession. 'My uncle .and my&#xD;
father *ere ;twin brothers.  The resemblance&#xD;
betweenthem is so marked, that the one is often&#xD;
mistaken for the other. My grandfather was a&#xD;
man of fortune., My, father was his favorite&#xD;
child, forthe wayward habits of Karl, the twin&#xD;
brother, displeased bim. Dying, my grandfather&#xD;
left the bulkof his property to my father. From&#xD;
that hour the. tendency of Karl Beman was&#xD;
downward.- My father generously advanced&#xD;
him large sums ; but his kindness met with in--&#xD;
gratitude for its reward. My uncle married a&#xD;
lovely woman, who lived just long enough to&#xD;
see her husband penniless, and abandoned, and&#xD;
her little'daughter entering upon her fifth year.&#xD;
Karl loVed his child, and my father himself has&#xD;
attended to her education,- and supplied all her&#xD;
wants, though he has long ceased to be on inti-&#xD;
mate terms with my uncle. What has transpired&#xD;
within the last twenty-four hours, leads me to&#xD;
believe that he has added robbery to other sins&#xD;
y but I entreat of you not to bring him to justice.&#xD;
Lave to Heaven the punishment of his many&#xD;
crimess."'&#xD;
"May he-who reads men's thoughts forgive&#xD;
me the wrong I have done you, Iva 1" cried&#xD;
Hans, sinking on his knees.&#xD;
" And may Heaven bless her for being a good&#xD;
angel t7 me and mine," said 'a husky voice.&#xD;
Hans looked up, and beheld the exact counter-&#xD;
part of George Beman---and recognized in him&#xD;
the man who had previously robbed him of his&#xD;
purse.&#xD;
" This angel," continued, the intruder, "has&#xD;
&#xD;
tOld you the truth. I am the guilty nman. Beck-&#xD;
lessness, pride and poverty drove) me t)3 the-&#xD;
commission of the crini  'Iam guilty of only&#xD;
two robberies, which I might :ieverhave con-&#xD;
fessed, had it not been fqtl  sake of this fair&#xD;
girl. I restore your moneyjigitouched; for my,&#xD;
whole nature shrank froni the thought of appro-&#xD;
priating it to:my.own or my daughter's use. I&#xD;
shall go to America, and it is 'probable I shall&#xD;
see you no more;. Iva, with you I leave the&#xD;
most precious of all earthly things-my only&#xD;
child.'-&#xD;
Karl's voice grew tremulous, and he, was&#xD;
obliged to pause.&#xD;
"My only child!1 Iva,-you will be kind to her.&#xD;
Conceal from her, as you value your soul's hap-&#xD;
ness, the knowledge of her father's crime."&#xD;
.,Karl Beman waited for no reply. He turned&#xD;
on his heel and left the house toreturn no more.&#xD;
As he passed out of the. room, Hans saw Iva's&#xD;
father put a yell-filled purse into his hand, gaze&#xD;
into his face a moment, and in a broken.voice,&#xD;
say:&#xD;
"Farewell, Karl. God bless you."&#xD;
" What a fortunate thingthat my horse stum-&#xD;
bled," said Hans to himself, on his wedding&#xD;
night.&#xD;
Frederic found that he'was really in love with&#xD;
Karl's daughter, and that that love really had&#xD;
its birtkat the-moment she had assisted hiin to&#xD;
arise and, mount his horse, on the night of the&#xD;
robbery. Therefore,.when he exclaimed on his&#xD;
wedding day, "What a fortunate fall !" the&#xD;
reader will understand what he meant.&#xD;
When Karl Beman was next heard from, he&#xD;
was serving with great creditin the American&#xD;
army.&#xD;
Thus ends our tal, .leaving all parties pros-&#xD;
I perous and happy.&#xD;

THE END.&#xD;
