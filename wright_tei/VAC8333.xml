CHAPTER I.&#xD;
&#xD;
G7oucester inlet.  A  boat and its occupants.  A  lovely visitant and an interesting conver-&#xD;
sation.  Brandon St. Leger, the miller.  A touching scene.  A rude interruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
F the reader will turn to the map of Virginia&#xD;
A   and glance along the indented delineation&#xD;
of the Chesapeake shore, he will detect a small&#xD;
inlet penetrating into the coast of Gloucester&#xD;
about a league north of York river. It is here&#xD;
the first scene of our story opens.&#xD;
This inlet is irregular in shape and has a&#xD;
number of jagged points running into it, with&#xD;
small, deep coves between, which, with a rocky&#xD;
islet here and there covered with moss and a&#xD;
few wild trees, give the place a romantic-aspect.&#xD;
The entrance to the inlet from the bay is not di-&#xD;
rect, but first it flows into a basin three and a&#xD;
quarter miles across, which basin finds an open-&#xD;
ing into Chesapeake bay through a narrow and&#xD;
somewhat intricate channel, and better known to&#xD;
the fishermen and bum-boat skippers than to the&#xD;
regular coasters, which seldom found their way&#xD;
in these out of the way waters, save when driv-'&#xD;
en from their moorings in York river by a south-&#xD;
&#xD;
east gale, or sought its shelter from a gale onj&#xD;
the bay.&#xD;
The shores of this inlet were chiefly in a state&#xD;
of nature, unless a fisher's cabin perched herd&#xD;
and there upon its rocky headlands might serve&#xD;
to redeem it from this character. Farms, or cul-&#xD;
tivation' beyond a mere patch -of garden about&#xD;
the huts, tgere was none. Sometimes the dark&#xD;
woods would approach close to the beach and&#xD;
cast the shadows of their gnarled trunks and&#xD;
limbs in the clear, still wave beneath ; and some-&#xD;
times a rocky barrier of gray granite would over-&#xD;
hang the coves that scolloped the border of the&#xD;
inner bay.&#xD;
There were, however, two remarkable objects&#xD;
that gave character to the scenery of this land-&#xD;
locked inlet, and relieved the otherwise solitary&#xD;
features of the place. One of these was a wind-&#xD;
mill, constructed of stone, that stoods upon a&#xD;
naked rock where the windslcould reach it unob-&#xD;

THE DANCING STAR.                                          THE DANCING STAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
structed ; and the other was a ruin which was&#xD;
something between a fort and a light-house. It&#xD;
was situated upon a bluff headland where the&#xD;
e inlet opened into the lesser bay, -and command-&#xD;
a ed not only the waters of this bay but the spark&#xD;
ling Chesapeake five miles off, and the towers&#xD;
of York four miles to the south were visible&#xD;
from lit. By the side of the mill was a square&#xD;
stone dwelling, the abode of the miller ; its&#xD;
roof steep and its roqftree high, on each end of&#xD;
which was a weather-cock, and upon the top of&#xD;
the mill was a third in the slape of a fish. There&#xD;
was also a roof, thatched and patched with tiles&#xD;
peering above the wall of the ruin, which, from&#xD;
the smoke wreath curling skyward from it, was&#xD;
the home of some occupant ; but as there was no&#xD;
light kept in the ruinous tower which had once&#xD;
been a light-house, it could not have been the&#xD;
watcher of the beacon. The windmill and ruin&#xD;
were on the same ridge and not three hundred&#xD;
yards apart, so that the voice of a person at the&#xD;
door of the one could be heard at the other.&#xD;
Our story opens towards the decline of a day&#xD;
in the month of September, and so many years&#xD;
ago that the gray-haired man who may read-&#xD;
these lines was then a lad. The sky wore that&#xD;
roseate and purple mingled hue that it puts on&#xD;
before sunset in the, beginning of autumn. A&#xD;
soft haze filled the air, and a calm summery si-&#xD;
lence, broken only by the hum of, insects or the&#xD;
tinkling ripple of the small waves, prevailed.&#xD;
The sun was so tempered by the low position it&#xD;
1 had descended to near the horizon that its beams&#xD;
invited their enjoyment rather than repelled, as&#xD;
they had done at noon by their heat, those who&#xD;
sat in them.&#xD;
Many skiffs, scallops, bum-boats and fishing-&#xD;
acks werkscattered about on the surface of&#xD;
t e inlet, either at anchor near the hut of their&#xD;
owner, or becalmed far off unable to reach the&#xD;
land, or floating and fishing with the idle ebb of&#xD;
the tide. None of these crafts were more than&#xD;
five or seven tons large, and the latter were the&#xD;
bum-boats, a species of bay-vessel used to con&#xD;
vey corn, flour, fruit, vegetables and even stock,&#xD;
&#xD;
from the farms along the water side of Glouces-&#xD;
ter county to York and Norfolk southward, and&#xD;
&#xD;
to Baltimore and up the Potomac north wardly.&#xD;
The inlet was the favorite rendezvous of these&#xD;
vessels during the summer when they were little&#xD;
employed. Here they refitted, were repaired,&#xD;
and put in order for the lively autumnal season&#xD;
when the teeming harvests would crowd once&#xD;
more their broad decks and shallow holds with&#xD;
freights.&#xD;
One of these bum-boats was gayer than its&#xD;
fellows, having a bright scarlet pennon flying a;&#xD;
its single mast, and snow white canvass, and a&#xD;
green and white hull, as if the owner was gifted&#xD;
with more taste than the skippers of the sur-&#xD;
rounding craft exhibited. This little vessel&#xD;
was slowly drawing nearer that part of the shore&#xD;
where .the windmill and ruin stood, availing&#xD;
itself of every cat's paw of wind to run in nigher.&#xD;
It contained but two persons, a man and a negro&#xD;
slave in a red shirt and white trowsers. The&#xD;
former was young and well made, with a bright&#xD;
hazel eye, flowing brown hair inclined to curl,&#xD;
and florid cheeks, with fine teeth and red lips.&#xD;
He was not above three-and-twenty. His sun-&#xD;
brown hands and the developed muscular out-&#xD;
line of the young sailor, showed that he was&#xD;
nothing more than-his coarse attire and present&#xD;
employment specified, a hard-toiling craftsman&#xD;
of the bay, who lived by his manly and honest&#xD;
labor. He wore a straw tarpaulin, narrow of&#xD;
brim, and a gray linen jacket and duck&#xD;
trowsers, with a blue shirt, the collar loosely&#xD;
tied together by a plaid bandanachandkerchief.&#xD;
He was s king a cigar of good tobacco with a&#xD;
careless air, hisfoni lounging in t-  rn sheets&#xD;
with his left hand one tiller, and one foot&#xD;
hanging over the quarter-rail almost touching the&#xD;
water. He had a frank, bold air which would&#xD;
have inspired a maiden with trusting confidence&#xD;
in his power to protect, and an enemy with&#xD;
respect.                s   .&#xD;
He seemed to be listlessly gazing upon te&#xD;
prospect about him, in the additional bea ty&#xD;
which the golden skies and empurpled air lent&#xD;
to it. Astern was the narrow entrance by which&#xD;
&#xD;
he had half an hour before sailed into the inlet&#xD;
from Gloster bay, beyond which was the Ches-&#xD;
apeake, on the broad bosom of which were half&#xD;
&#xD;
a score of trading vessels, schooners and brigs,&#xD;
becalmed like himself, some bound up to the&#xD;
city of Baltimore, others with their prows point.&#xD;
ing oceanward. Near him and encircling him&#xD;
were the numerous lesser craft which we have&#xD;
already noticed. The green, or wooded, or&#xD;
rocky shores, nowhere two miles distant from&#xD;
him, and on the north not a quarter of that di-&#xD;
ameter, were bending like embracing arms about&#xD;
him and his companions on the water. If his&#xD;
eye lingered over ne part of the shores more&#xD;
than another, it was that where stood the wind-&#xD;
mill, its huge white wings at rest looking like a&#xD;
gigantic guide-post.&#xD;
The boat was laden with a few kegs, a barrel&#xD;
or two, four or five boxes, a bale of canvass, and&#xD;
some small articles such as the humble fishers&#xD;
sent for from time to time down to York, some-&#xD;
,         times paying the hard money, a rare commodity&#xD;
among them, but oftener bartering domestics,&#xD;
grain, dried fish, and vegetables for them. The&#xD;
little vessel was not more than six tons measure-&#xD;
ment, had but one mast, which carried a main-&#xD;
sail and a topsail about as large as a quarter-&#xD;
master's pocket-handkerchief. But everything&#xD;
about her was neat and ship-shape, and she was&#xD;
made for sailing like a bird, or there is no form-&#xD;
ing an opinion of a vessel's qualities by the shear&#xD;
of her bows and the graceful bend of her counter.&#xD;
The negro, who was amusing himself by lying&#xD;
flat on his belly and supporting his cheeks in his&#xD;
hands with his elbows spread on the deck, and&#xD;
in this attitude watching a flight of (lucks as,&#xD;
they flew in a long line across a point of land&#xD;
towards the west, at length broke the silence :&#xD;
Ah, massa Elliot, if dis chil' ony. hab a&#xD;
double bar I gun, he kill two demi wil' goos mity&#xD;
easy at one shot."&#xD;
- You know, Tony, you rascal you, that you&#xD;
wouldn't touch a pocket-pistol with a ten foot&#xD;
pole, and talk about shooting a double barrelled&#xD;
gun. When will you quit such tall talking, es&#xD;
'pecially before me who know what a coward&#xD;
you are?"&#xD;
&#xD;
Here the young man's eye twinkled with a&#xD;
*    smile in it. and he puffed his cigar with a glance&#xD;
almost unconsciously turned in the direction of&#xD;
&#xD;
the windmill. It was not a lookHof indifference,&#xD;
nor of expectation, nor of vacancy, nor because&#xD;
he might as well look there as anywhere else--&#xD;
but it was that kind of glance which follows a&#xD;
t ought of the heart, which betrays the direction&#xD;
in which points the needle of that compass which&#xD;
every young man carries in his bosom, and the&#xD;
magnet of which must sooner or later find its&#xD;
pole. The glance was playing its "tell tale."&#xD;
As we are something skilled in detecting wlt&#xD;
passes within the breast of men by the to e-&#xD;
ments of their eye, we should say that such a&#xD;
glance as our young boatman shot towards the&#xD;
stone house by the windmill, had its peculiar&#xD;
character in the fact' that the cottage con-&#xD;
tained a maiden, more or less young and lovely,&#xD;
in whom his feelings were interested. This is&#xD;
our interpretation of this movement of his eye;&#xD;
but the progress of our story will determine.&#xD;
- " But, Massa Elliot," responded Tony, look-&#xD;
ing a little blank at this reception of his obser-&#xD;
vation touching the gun with two barrels, " die&#xD;
chil' ant feared ob de gun, not at all; dat ant&#xD;
it; it am de orful loud noise dat make dis nig-&#xD;
ger seared ! I knows wat you's thinkin' 'bout&#xD;
me, you 'members dat time Massa Beachampe&#xD;
lef' his gun,- and [ttook him and shot at dat&#xD;
rack crow and knock mysef' over, apd den git&#xD;
up an' iun like de deble. You's thinkia' 'bout&#xD;
dat, yay ?"&#xD;
"I dare say, Tony."&#xD;
" Well, now, it's the skriptral truth, Massa&#xD;
Elliot, it want de gun skeared dis chil', ony de&#xD;
drefful loud noise. Dis nigger hab bigger ears&#xD;
dan common, and mity sight o' sound get in 'em&#xD;
at onet.  If 't want for de noise I wouldn't mind&#xD;
a tive barrel gun no more dan I does dis boat&#xD;
hook, yay "&#xD;
"WHave you heard from Nevil Beachampe,&#xD;
lately, Tony ?" asked Elliot Be-aufort, who seem-&#xD;
ed to have been thinking of the person who&#xD;
owned this name since Tony had mentioned it,&#xD;
and with a frown on his brow and an expression&#xD;
ill at ease.&#xD;

Elliot, he and you nebber see one anoder agen,&#xD;
coz he's mity desp'rate and^ don't mind using'&#xD;
knives ; and I know your blood's up 'bout dat&#xD;
tiiiie when Miss Alice-.-"&#xD;
" That will do, Tony. Don't speak of that !&#xD;
1 think about it often enough. I wish to meet&#xD;
him again. It will be the last meeting he will&#xD;
have on land or sea with a mortal man!"&#xD;
" Ah, Massa Elliot, don't you think about&#xD;
ever doin' anything to him, for jist as sure as&#xD;
you do he'll kill you, for he's learned to use&#xD;
swords and pistols, and wouldn't mind killing&#xD;
as you would, who ant so bad a heart as he&#xD;
had. Take old Toney's advice and let him go.&#xD;
Dere's Miss Alice jist as safe as ever, and no&#xD;
harm done---"&#xD;
" Hush, man. That is enough. Haul aft&#xD;
the sheet. There is a puff of air."&#xD;
" So dar is, and de sails filling' right smart,"&#xD;
answered the gray old black man, getting to his&#xD;
fet rather stiffly and obeying the order with a&#xD;
look of lively satisfaction.  " We'll have a wind&#xD;
to run in, sure. .1 was pesky feared dat dis ole&#xD;
nigger man 'd have to row home."&#xD;
" You are always careful of your ancient&#xD;
bones, and don't do a finger's more work than&#xD;
you are compelled to," answered Elliot, with a&#xD;
pleasant look.  "Give a pull to the halyards,&#xD;
don't you.see they are slack. The sail wantsI&#xD;
three inches of being tort set."&#xD;
" Dat him, massa ?" asked Tony, after three&#xD;
pulls and three grunts.&#xD;
" Yes, belay I Now we have way on her !"&#xD;
"0O, massa," resumed Tony, squatting down&#xD;
again as he saw the bum-boat was gliding smooth. I&#xD;
lg along, " I nebber ax no more dan let do wind&#xD;
blow dis chil' all round de world ! And inow I I&#xD;
thinks 'bout it, I has a pertikier declination,&#xD;
young massa, to ax you dis here kestion. I&#xD;
hear Missy Mag read out ob a book onet dat deo&#xD;
world be round-round jist like a water-million. I&#xD;
Now, Massa Elliot, you -nebber poses on old I&#xD;
&#xD;
ike a gigantic' banjo played upon actively by a&#xD;
pair of bones of proportionate magnitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yay! Dare, you say so too. Den, if dis&#xD;
world am round as a punkin, and tarn round&#xD;
ebbery day, as Missy Mag read it do, wharfor&#xD;
dis nigger no stan on him head ?"&#xD;
The.young man made no reply, perhaps dick&#xD;
not even hear this emphatic interrogation of this&#xD;
pursuer after knowledge under difficulties, for&#xD;
his attention was attracted at that moment by a&#xD;
waving hand from the door of the stone house&#xD;
by the mill. He answered it by springing to&#xD;
his feet and waving his straw hat, while his fine&#xD;
eyes brightened and shone with the light that&#xD;
only a maiden's loved image in the heart can&#xD;
kindle.. The boat was full a quarter of a mile&#xD;
from the shore, and no eye but a lover's could&#xD;
have detected the form of the young girl to&#xD;
whom the hand appertained, half hidden as it&#xD;
was by a rose bush that grew before the door.&#xD;
Old Tony looked but could see nothing, though&#xD;
he tried hard to make out what object bad pre-&#xD;
vented his young master from giving heed to his&#xD;
profound investigations into the mysteries of&#xD;
physical science.&#xD;
" Yay !" he ejaculated in a monosyllable, the&#xD;
accent and tone of which can only begin to be&#xD;
described by the three letters which we have put&#xD;
together at the beginning of this sentence.&#xD;
"Yay ! Wat dat, Massa Elliot ?"&#xD;
" Margaret," answered the young sailor with&#xD;
looks of pleasure.&#xD;
" We ben gone ony two day and you make as&#xD;
much glad as thof we ben gon a mont."&#xD;
"Hold your ugly tongue, uncle Tony. There's&#xD;
Alice, too ! Their pretty arms are worth any&#xD;
pair of signals in the whole navy ! See how&#xD;
they wave at us."&#xD;
Hereupon Tony, unable to restrain,the im-&#xD;
pulse, and willing to postpone, under the circum-&#xD;
stances, further philosophical inquiries touching&#xD;
the shape and diurnal rotation of the earth,&#xD;
snatched off an old felt that looked as if it bad&#xD;
been used all through the Christmas holidays&#xD;
:or a foot ball on a college green, and began to&#xD;
wave back and hurrah and dance on his long&#xD;
projecting heels, till the hollow deck sounded&#xD;
&#xD;
this good news."&#xD;
" He began to mend last night; the fever re&#xD;
broke at sundown yesterday, and to-day he sat wi&#xD;
up and ate broth."                        kn&#xD;
&#xD;
"Stop that, you Guinea, or you'll break&#xD;
through the deck or break off your heels," ca -&#xD;
ed out Elliot. " Stand by to brail up."&#xD;
"Nebber break off dese heel, Massa Elliot.&#xD;
Dey screw on too hard for dat accident to&#xD;
happen. Leff dis chil' ax you de one more kes.&#xD;
tion, Massa Elliot. What am de nigger man's&#xD;
leg nail on in de middle ob him foot fo', when&#xD;
de white gemman foot grow out from de eend.&#xD;
Dis nigger's heel be in de middle ob him shoe !&#xD;
Look dere." And Tony thrust out his enor-&#xD;
mous sole.  "I has to cut a notch in 'em afore&#xD;
I puts 'em on, coz if I should get 'em on wrong&#xD;
ways behind, I'd do noffin all day but back wat-1&#xD;
er like massa crab, and nebber get no whar but&#xD;
behind me I"&#xD;
" Brail up," shouted Elliot, as he brought&#xD;
the bows of his vessel into the wind within half 1&#xD;
a dozen fathoms of a flat rock, along-side of&#xD;
which he laid the obedient craft as motionless as&#xD;
if she were at anchor. Toney, who always for-&#xD;
got his inquisitiveness whensoever there was&#xD;
anything to do, sprung to land with a hawser I&#xD;
and secured the craft to a post fixed in the rock f&#xD;
for this purpose  A path led to the top of the&#xD;
bluff, on which fifty feet above his head stood a a&#xD;
fair girl awaiting him. A few bounds brought i&#xD;
him to her side.                           t&#xD;
There was a frank, friendly grasp of the hands, i&#xD;
and smiles of that affectionate sympathy between s.&#xD;
them which betrayed that they were lovers.&#xD;
"I am so glad you have got in before night,&#xD;
Elliot," said the maiden. " Alice and I have&#xD;
been watching your boat this two hours, and I&#xD;
thought that it did not move at all. It seemed&#xD;
to me you would never get here."&#xD;
"J guessed you were watching nmeMargaret, c&#xD;
and I thought I saw you long before you waved w&#xD;
your hand," answered Elliot. " How is your ai&#xD;
father ?"h&#xD;
"0O, he is so much better. He will hardly lo&#xD;
need the medicines if .you brought them." , a&#xD;
" I have got them, and I feared I should nod ea&#xD;
be here to do any good. I am so glad to hear\ ch&#xD;
&#xD;
"I have seen in town the captain of the'&#xD;
venue- cutter, who was here a few weeks'agojI&#xD;
ith his vessel," said the young man. ",You&#xD;

&#xD;
"Then he is doing bravely. I thought so&#xD;
from the bright smile on your face when I saw&#xD;
you. Where is Alice ?"&#xD;
"She has gone "into the fort. Her mother&#xD;
called to her just as she was coming down with&#xD;
me to meet you."&#xD;
Elliot sighed, and a slight muscular contrac-&#xD;
tion about his brow betrayed a spirit annoyed at&#xD;
something which was associated with his mother..;&#xD;
"Has she been over to the mill?"&#xD;
" No. She keeps in the fort and makes in-&#xD;
cantations all the time."&#xD;
"I thought so, when I saw the blue and&#xD;
black smoke going out of the chimney."&#xD;
"Never mind, Elliot," said the maiden;kindly.&#xD;
"I try not to mind; but when one would love&#xD;
and respect his mother, and yet cannot do it,&#xD;
but rather feel like despising her, it is very bard."&#xD;
"I know it is; but Alice loves you so fondly."&#xD;
"And Margy, too ?" he asked, as if he knew&#xD;
what her reply would be.&#xD;
"0, you know that, Elliot ; you only ask to&#xD;
have me say so. - Come, let us go up and see&#xD;
father. He asks for you."&#xD;
"I love to hear you say you love me. Has?&#xD;
ny news happened in the two days past ?" he'&#xD;
inquired, as side by side they walked towards&#xD;
he stone hut near the windmill, leaving Tony&#xD;
n the boat preparing to land the freight, and&#xD;
inging as he worked:&#xD;
"0, nebber, nebber, nebber,&#xD;
0, nebber tell you mammy,&#xD;
How you run'd away&#xD;
From ole Virginny's shore,&#xD;
T'oder day."&#xD;
The path by which they proceeded from the&#xD;
ove-side to the house was. narrow, and if twreib&#xD;
alked in it side by side, they had to touch andy&#xD;
rmn; and this proved so agreeable to Elliot that2j&#xD;
3 placed his arm about the fair girl's waist, andt&#xD;
eking their forms thus together, they walked&#xD;
thier as one than two in harmonious tread, and,4&#xD;

"I feared he would persuade you, too, you&#xD;
listened so earnestly, Elliot. But you saw that&#xD;
I looked sad abgut it, and so refused. You&#xD;
don't know how grateful I was."&#xD;
But it was a great sacrifice, Margy. He&#xD;
\ offered me four times more a month than I can.&#xD;
make by my boatfthough I made three trips a&#xD;
weekto York instead of one."&#xD;
" But you don't want to make more, Elliot.&#xD;
I know you are too noble to be avaricious. Be-&#xD;
sides, you are here with Alice and me, and,&#xD;
our society you would lose if you attached your-&#xD;
self to the cutter. You would be - cruising the&#xD;
whole length of the bay all the time, and some-&#xD;
times you would be at sea. No, no, Elliot, I hope&#xD;
you are not going to say the captain has per-&#xD;
suaded you at last."&#xD;
"No, not persuaded me, Margy; but he says&#xD;
he will give me the place of quarter-master.&#xD;
This would-would-"&#xD;
Seeing her Ibver hesitate, Margaret said in a&#xD;
serious tone,'as if the proposition to go on board&#xD;
the cutter was every way distasteful to her,&#xD;
would what, Elliot ?"&#xD;
"Would enable me to get money enough in a&#xD;
year to--to marry you, Margaret !" he answered,&#xD;
blushing; while her own cheeks .reflected the&#xD;
rich crimson.&#xD;
"We can be married, Elliot, without your&#xD;
going to serve on board the cutter," she an-&#xD;
swered with quickness.-&#xD;
"We must have a cot ; we must have it fur-&#xD;
nished; we must have provisions. Ab, much&#xD;
as we love each other, Margy, we can't live on&#xD;
love."&#xD;
"I know that, Elliot; but .you have your&#xD;
boat. I can knit and weave, and-"&#xD;
"I know that, Margy ; but it will' be three&#xD;
years and more before in this way 'we can lay&#xD;
up enough for me to buy a little garden and&#xD;
house; and I am too proud to live on your&#xD;
father."&#xD;
" He wants you to do so. He is failing, and&#xD;
says he must have some one to aid him in taking&#xD;
eare of things."&#xD;
&#xD;
"He must hire, then, Margy. I will never&#xD;
let even your father say he has given me the&#xD;
roof over my head.",&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, don't let us talk about it now, dear&#xD;
Elliot; here we are at the door. But just let&#xD;
me tell you that with my consent you shall nev-&#xD;
er go into the revenue service."&#xD;
"Then I must go without it, Margy, " he said,&#xD;
smiling, as he stole a kiss from hereheek as she&#xD;
opened the door.&#xD;
The house faced the inlet, and 'its moss cov-&#xD;
ered sides and ancient roof showed that it had&#xD;
stood there lng prior to the revolution. A small&#xD;
grassy enclosure surrounded -it, bordered by a&#xD;
low wall of hedge and rocks.  A gate led from&#xD;
it on the right to another enclosure also bounded-&#xD;
by a stone wall, in the centre of which stood the&#xD;
windmill, which was of an octagon shape, strong-&#xD;
ly constructed of hewn stone. It wad forty feet&#xD;
in height, tapering as it rose in the air. There&#xD;
was a low door in the eastern side towards the&#xD;
house, from which it was but a few yards dis-&#xD;
tant. Four tiers of circular windows rose one'&#xD;
above another to the top and gave light to a&#xD;
winding stair-way within, There were four lofts&#xD;
one above another : and in the middle loft was'&#xD;
the huge axle that revolved with the moving&#xD;
wings when the wind set them in motion. In&#xD;
the second and third lofts were placed the grain&#xD;
for grinding, and the lower floor wai partitioned&#xD;
off into square bins to receive the descending&#xD;
streams of snowy flour. This mill had been&#xD;
used by the earliest settlers, beyond the memory&#xD;
of the oldest man ; and in part supplied the&#xD;
American army with flour during the siege of&#xD;
York. It, therefore, had- a famous name ; and&#xD;
although at the time of our story there were not&#xD;
so many large wheat farms on the neighboring&#xD;
lands as in former times, yet corn enough came&#xD;
to old Brand Sledger's- mill, as the owner was&#xD;
:called, though his name was Brandon St. Leger,&#xD;
to keep him busily grinding from one week's&#xD;
end to another. Inheriting it from his fathers,&#xD;
who had been millers there before him, he lived&#xD;
in comfortable independence, and was not a lit-&#xD;
tle vain of two things, the reputation of his mill&#xD;
and the beauty of his only child, Margaret St.&#xD;
Leger,&#xD;
&#xD;
" Here is Elliot, father," said his daughter, as&#xD;
she entered the room where he was propped up&#xD;
&#xD;
in an arm-chair of well worn leather, which he&#xD;
boasted, with truth, that Lafayette had once sat&#xD;
in and taken an after-dinner nap ; but as it is a&#xD;
long story and has no especial bearing upon our&#xD;
narrative, we will not detain the reader, as old&#xD;
Brand, were he alive and looking over our shoul-&#xD;
der, would have us do, to tell it.&#xD;
"Glad to see thee, glad to see thee, son in-&#xD;
law to be," said the miller, reaching out his&#xD;
hand.  " You see I am getting a breeze again,&#xD;
and shall be able to grind many a grist yet be-&#xD;
fore I die."&#xD;
" I hope so, Master Brand ; I am thankful to&#xD;
find you up, though pale a bit."&#xD;
"Yes, pale, but that is nothing. Glad to see&#xD;
you back. : I was troubled about you in my fe-&#xD;
ver. Talked a good deal about you, I believe.&#xD;
I was afraid I should die and leave my pretty&#xD;
one alone and unprotected! I have made up&#xD;
my mind," he added, emphatically, though his&#xD;
voice shook a little from feebleness.  " Why&#xD;
don't you ask me, you rogue, what it is I've made&#xD;
up my mind to do&#xD;
"Well, sir, perhaps it is to take better care&#xD;
of your health, and not go out in the rain again&#xD;
without your hat."&#xD;
"iNot a bit of it, not one bit of it ! I'll get&#xD;
.cold just when I please. I've made up ny&#xD;
mind that you and Margy shall get married.&#xD;
" 0, father !" ejaculated halfreproachfully the&#xD;
happy girl.&#xD;
"6Nothing would give me so much joy, sir ;&#xD;
but-" answered Elliot, regarding the old miller&#xD;
as he sat in his arm-chair. with a red kerchief&#xD;
tied hard about his head just above the eyebrows,&#xD;
which, shaggy and gray, projected far out be-&#xD;
yond. His high Roman nose, and large face,&#xD;
for he was a very large formed man altogether,&#xD;
brought into full relief by this close fitting cap,&#xD;
gave him a very striking appearance and one&#xD;
that commanded respect; for Brand Sled ger,-&#xD;
though a man in humble life, was just the sort&#xD;
of ian in appearance that the Indians, who&#xD;
reverence manliness of size, would have chosen&#xD;
for their chief. He was honest, sensible, intel-&#xD;
&#xD;
igent and brave, and though obstinate at times,&#xD;
as gentle as a woman to the helpless and unfor-&#xD;
&#xD;
tunate. His love for his daughter brought out&#xD;
into daily exercise all the best qualities of his&#xD;
heart ; and his worse ones were only apparent to&#xD;
those bad men whose falsehood and doubleness&#xD;
of character roused his indignation and contempt.&#xD;
He was not a more determined friend to the&#xD;
widow and orphan than he was a determined foe&#xD;
to their oppressors.. He interrupted Elliot with&#xD;
a frown that made his white eyebrows snap as if&#xD;
they emitted lightning.&#xD;
"But me no buts. I know what you would&#xD;
say. You will not let old Brand do you a favor.&#xD;
You must wait years yet to get the means I can&#xD;
give you with a scratch of a pen ; and all this&#xD;
while Margy will be pining, you a sighing, and&#xD;
both miserable for the pride of earning the chips&#xD;
that are to make your pot boil. Don't say a&#xD;
word. I can get angry if I am a good-natured&#xD;
man.   Sick folk get their dander up quick."&#xD;
" But-"&#xD;
" There it is !-but, but, but ! .,I don't mind&#xD;
your buts a button.  Come to ne, Margy.&#xD;
Give me your hand.    Do you love-but no,&#xD;
you, young man, come here and answer this&#xD;
question first. Do you love this maiden ?"&#xD;
Better than life."&#xD;
That's heartily said. You speak like a man&#xD;
who can defend her, if need be, with life. I&#xD;
like the ring of your voice. Its tones have&#xD;
metal in 'em.. Now, Margy !"&#xD;
" Sir."&#xD;
" Bless me how you tremble, like the wings&#xD;
of the mill when the wind, is rising. Do you&#xD;
love Elliot Beaufort, here ?"&#xD;
" I know that he loves me, and I should be&#xD;
ungrateful not to love him in return."&#xD;
" That wont .do. That isn't a right up and&#xD;
down answer. Say you love him because you&#xD;
can't held it. That's the only kind of love I&#xD;
ever knew anything about when I was young.&#xD;
I loved your mother because I couldn't help it ;&#xD;
and that's all the reason she ever gave for loving&#xD;
me. Loving for gratitude is only a trading af-&#xD;
fair; it's give mne wind and I'll grind your corn !&#xD;
Pay me toll and I'll toll you grist !"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, dear father, I love Elliot because I&#xD;
can't help loving him !"&#xD;

for her to govern and command. The woman her by Elliot, on whose shoulders they fell.&#xD;
was made for the man and not the man for the  " I will go at once, mother," she said.&#xD;
woman, and it is, therefore, an unnatural thing "Don't strike her, woman !'' said the miller,&#xD;

Impulsively and with tears in their eyes, both "Mother, let us go home," said Elliot,' saying&#xD;

E now change the scene of our story&#xD;
to the town of York, situated not more&#xD;
than a league and a half south of the inlet,.and&#xD;
near the mouth of York river, .a short distance&#xD;
from the Chesapeake. It is the evening of the,&#xD;
same day on which.we have seen Elliot Beaufort&#xD;
reach the windmill, on his return from the town.&#xD;
The town of York is ancient, and in thle streets&#xD;
near the water are many old edifices, which have&#xD;
stood there long prior to the revolution. Some&#xD;
of them used to be the residences of the gentry&#xD;
of that day, and one of them was the house for&#xD;
the king's customs, and another the abode of&#xD;
the colonial governor. In the latter, the Brit&#xD;
ish general.in chief who defended York held his&#xD;
quarters; and its walls still bear the traces of&#xD;
the cannon shot that struck it. But this street,&#xD;
once so imposing and aristocratic, in the day&#xD;
when chapeaux, small clothes and powdered&#xD;
heads were in fashion, has now lost its exclusive&#xD;

character. Edifices that one hundred years ago:''&#xD;
were regarded as stately affairs, after the revo-&#xD;
lution, when the increase of wealth enlarged the&#xD;
ideas of the citizens touching grandeur, these&#xD;
abodes were deserted for more modern and showy'-&#xD;
structures, and new streets, adorned with Italian 4&#xD;
villas, took the place of and wholly eclipsed the"bi&#xD;
venerable Water street, with its Dutch brck&#xD;
habitations with their high roofs, enormous pro&#xD;
jecting gables, and little windows.&#xD;
It is with old houses, once fine, as it is with&#xD;

ficer with his swabs, and even hearts united by&#xD;
a love knot, all done, with more or less-skill,&#xD;
with the point of a jack-knife or the end of a&#xD;
nail. - There were, in addition.to these volun&#xD;
teer adornments, not less than sixteen colored&#xD;
prints in black frames hung all round, four feet&#xD;
apart, within four inches of the ceiling. Some&#xD;
of these represented naval battles between Jon-&#xD;
athan and John Bull, in which, with true nation-&#xD;
al partiality, Jonathan was always the victor-&#xD;
the English red cross being constantly seen drag-&#xD;
ging at the end of a flag staff in the water, or&#xD;
else midway in air taking the directi-in of the-&#xD;
water, while the stars and stripes waved aloft in&#xD;
the breeze, snapping their victorious fingers in&#xD;
saucy triumph. Four of the frames held por-&#xD;
traits separately of Perry, Preble, Bainbridge&#xD;
and McDonough, all four looking as fierce as&#xD;
Turks. To relieve this warlike garniture of the&#xD;
room, there were interspersed three pictures of&#xD;
a sentimental character ; one being a shepherdess&#xD;
in blue ribbons and red shoes, leading an-orange&#xD;
colored sheep by a green string over blue rocks&#xD;
and indigo looking grass; another representing&#xD;
a neat sailor lad, in blue jacket and long togs,&#xD;
kissing, a pretty girl with rosy cheeks, flowing&#xD;
curls, and uncommonly short frock and panta-&#xD;
lets, with yellow shoes, tied with pink bows,&#xD;
with a ship loosing her topsails in the background.&#xD;
The third picture represented a marriage scene&#xD;
in a village church-the bridegroom being the&#xD;
identical sailor boy in the blue roundabout and&#xD;
white long togs, and the bride the lassie in&#xD;
the pink shoe-ties and remarkably short frock.&#xD;
Over the mantel-piece, which was broad and&#xD;
high, stood a pair of 'conch shells, i their del.&#xD;

and sund outlandish and beyond-sea curiosi&#xD;

end of a sword fish's spear, broken off in a plank&#xD;
and still held by the piece of plank. Two nin-&#xD;
iature black profiles cut out of white paper, with&#xD;
square pieces of black silk behind them, hung&#xD;
&#xD;
above the mantel, one of which was that of a&#xD;
pug-nosed, low-browed, bristly-haired, double&#xD;

The floor of'the tap was sanded, and-the win-&#xD;
dows guarded by calico curtains. Opposite the&#xD;
fireplace, in which, at the time of our story, was&#xD;
stuck a pine bush, was the tap or bar. This&#xD;
was a half-moon affair, and in the rear was lined&#xD;
with black bottles of all sizes, and plethoric-&#xD;
looking decanters. Its shelves also contained&#xD;
packages of smoking Virginia weed, bundles of&#xD;
domestic cigars, boxes of Havana cigars, that&#xD;
had never seen Havana, and blue pictured cov-&#xD;
ers, containing packs of cards, with other and&#xD;
various articles, usually found in a legitimate&#xD;
and well conducted seaport tap-room.&#xD;
Behind the tap stands a man, short but fleshy,&#xD;
with a red bully face, and wiry haiir-the coun-&#xD;
terpart and original, in fact, of the profile with&#xD;
the square piece of black silk for its background&#xD;
in the little brass-gilt frame above the mantel.&#xD;
This person is mine host - of "The Binnacle."&#xD;
He is about forty-eight years of age, or there-&#xD;
abouts, and it is apparent, from the smart round&#xD;
jacket, thickly set with anchor buttons, and the&#xD;
loose, nautical tie of the black handkerchief&#xD;
abo t his thick neck, and the boatswain-like cut&#xD;
of is whiskers, that he has been on the sea, and,&#xD;
still affects its fashions ; but in what capacity, or&#xD;
in what service, under what flag, or in what seas,&#xD;
nobody knew except Ned, or Captain Ned, as&#xD;
he was called by the frequenters of The Binna-&#xD;
cle, himself. He always preserved a cautious&#xD;
mystery touching entering into particulars in&#xD;
reference to his life before he took charge of&#xD;
the Light in the Binnacle, which was about fif-&#xD;
-I -&#xD;
teen years before. During this period, what-&#xD;
ever may have been his character previous, he&#xD;
had conmported himself, sc far as men's eyes&#xD;
went, like a trusty host and thriving citizen ;&#xD;
and as his landlord found no fault with him on&#xD;
the score of rent, as he always paid his debts&#xD;
promptly, and treated every body civilly, and&#xD;
kept the best going in his tap, he was a popular&#xD;
1nan in Old York street, and might have been&#xD;
&#xD;
elected alderman, without doubt, by his friends,&#xD;
if his ambition had taken that direction.&#xD;

THE DANCING STAR. .&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DANCING STAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
Captain Ned had been a married man, and&#xD;
his wife, whose black silk profile hangs vis- a vis&#xD;
with his own, was the former proprietor of the'&#xD;
inn, which now owned Captain Blouster as its&#xD;
master. Fifteen years before he had appeared&#xD;
in York ; no one knew whether he came by sea&#xD;
or by land, up the bay or down the river-and&#xD;
put up at the tavern, which was then kept by the&#xD;
widow of a, meek host, who died of his wife's&#xD;
har&#xD;
usage, as public report fully attested.-&#xD;
His helpmate had, scolded and worried him to,&#xD;
death. All the old women in the neighborhood&#xD;
said,-=-and who should know better ?-that he&#xD;
was tormented out of his little soul-case ; for&#xD;
Mister Simon Smerks was a little man of small&#xD;
stature, of small spirit, small heart, small voice,&#xD;
and small appetite. But as no coroner's inquest&#xD;
sat upon his body, which was found dead and&#xD;
cold in the boot-room, where he used to sleep&#xD;
alone on a straw mattress his wife charitably&#xD;
loaned him, while she luxuriated alone in the&#xD;
wide feather bed, with curtains, we cannot pos-&#xD;
itively affirm the exact mode by which his im-&#xD;
4   mediate exit from life was. elected ; we only&#xD;
know the fact that Mrs. Smerks became a widow,&#xD;
and after wearing a piece of narrow black ribbon&#xD;
over her cap for two weeks, she took it off, and&#xD;
set her cap for 'a man.&#xD;
"Yes," said she, talking over the matter on&#xD;
the seventeenth day after the departure of Simon&#xD;
1to that land where the voice of his wife could&#xD;
not penetrate, " yes; deacon, I intend, if I&#xD;
marry again, to marry a man !  Smerks was too&#xD;
meek. He had a soul that you could put into&#xD;
the bottom of this here thimble, and then put it&#xD;
h on your finger and not know it was there ! "-&#xD;
And here the widow, suiting the action to the&#xD;
word, thrust her finger to the extremity of her&#xD;
thimble with such a jerk that the deacon winced,&#xD;
expecting to hear the little soul of Simon Smerk&#xD;
cry out from the depths thereof. " I want a&#xD;
alman that will make mue afraid of him ! A wo-&#xD;
man that has a mean husband despises him, and&#xD;
t he ought to be despised; and that's the reason&#xD;
I've treated Smerks so !"&#xD;
&#xD;
a    Here the deacon looked blank. He had half&#xD;
an eye to the widow's hand and dollars, and the&#xD;
&#xD;
good custom of the inn, and was early making&#xD;
up to the widow--not exactly courting her yet,&#xD;
but standing by to speak first in good time,&#xD;
should he see any rival likely to succeed to Si-&#xD;
mon. He winced, for he knew that he himself&#xD;
bad hardly nerve enough, as her husband, to&#xD;
control her, for she was as brave as a dragoon,&#xD;
and as sharp as vinegar, and had a voice like a&#xD;
Cape Cod skipper, i1 a gale of wind.&#xD;
The deacon shook his head a great many times&#xD;
on his way home that night, and thought more&#xD;
than once that though he might gain the widow,&#xD;
he would lose his own life, like poor Simon.-~"&#xD;
One month to a day had Simon laid in his grave,&#xD;
when a bluff, stout, sea-dog looking man, well&#xD;
dressed, with a sun-burnt visage and a bluster-&#xD;
ing air, came noisily into the tap, and striking&#xD;
his fist hard down upon the bar, leered out of his&#xD;
left eye to the widow, who was within it, and&#xD;
ripping out a nor-west oath, asked her if she&#xD;
had board and lodgings for the devil, for a&#xD;
month-and as he did so, he poured a .handful&#xD;
of foreign gold upon the board.&#xD;
She stared at him with surprise, and even&#xD;
drew back a step from the front of the bar-the&#xD;
nearest approach to fear any body had ever seen&#xD;
her manifest; yet she kept her eyes fixed on his&#xD;
face resolutely.&#xD;
Yes," she answered, after regarding him&#xD;
steadily till one might count fifteen.&#xD;
"Then I'm your guest, madam. Count out&#xD;
your charges, and then give me my supper.-&#xD;
But first pour me out a flagon of your best Ja-&#xD;
maica I Come, do not look at me, woman, but&#xD;
obey me. I am as thirsty as a shark, and could&#xD;
drink Chesapeake Bay if - it were red rum and&#xD;
no salt in it !",                        ,&#xD;
The new comer quaffed the potation which&#xD;
she gave him, all the while looking at him with&#xD;
a sort of uneasy curiosity. -And well she might.&#xD;
I'he man fascinated her like a basilisk. Before&#xD;
the month was up- she had married him, and be~-&#xD;
fore the year was up he had buried her. She&#xD;
had married a man indeed, who seemed to have&#xD;
been sent, as she said to a confidential friend on&#xD;
&#xD;
her dying bed, from another world, by Smerks,&#xD;
to avenge himself on her for her treatment to&#xD;
&#xD;
him while living. - "0, how could - he hav&#xD;
made me marry him as he did, when I was a&#xD;
afraid of hirm as death, and he has made me obe3&#xD;
just as I made poor Smerks, and has broke m3&#xD;
heart. I was never made to obey a husband,&#xD;
and though he hasn't laid a finger on me, yet h&#xD;
has made me mind him just as particular as i&#xD;
I had been a child. I couldn't stand it n&#xD;
longer, and II am going to die !" And die sh&#xD;
did, fairly worn out in trying to resist the author&#xD;
ity of the man who seemed from the beginning&#xD;
to have acted as if he thoroughly understood her&#xD;
disposition, and really came, as she believed to&#xD;
the last, to avenge upon her the martyrdom of&#xD;
poor Smerks.&#xD;
This was the way that(Captain Ned got to be&#xD;
host of the Light in the Binnacle, and his popu-&#xD;
larity in York street had its foundation, no&#xD;
doubt, in his victory over the widow Smerks;&#xD;
for hen pecked men respect and honor the man&#xD;
who can conquer a termagant, and women who&#xD;
hen-peck love to see their rivals in this way com-&#xD;
pelled to succumb, as it is an inference of their&#xD;
own unconquerability ; and wives and husbands&#xD;
who neither peck nor are pecked, but live lov-&#xD;
ingly, rejoice to see a s olding wife bridled.--&#xD;
Therefore Captain Ned f und great favor from&#xD;
all parties, and was ever after looked upon as a&#xD;
very proper pattern of, a han.&#xD;
On the evening on which our reader is taken&#xD;
to the tap-room, just at that dusky time of the&#xD;
twilight when it is too light yet to have candles,&#xD;
and yet dark enough to make objects obscure in&#xD;
the room and without, a man who was standing&#xD;
by the window that looked out upon th. river,&#xD;
saw a small four-oared boat suddenly round the&#xD;
old pier-head, and pull in towards the stairs.&#xD;
"'Ere's river customers for ye, cap'n," said&#xD;
the man, with the officious bustle of a tipsy tap-&#xD;
room loafer, as his ragged coat, torn hat, old&#xD;
shoes down at the heels, bloated face and watery&#xD;
eyes showed that he was ; " four ears and ajig'&#xD;
in the stern. Prap's a officer ; it looks like a,&#xD;
reveny boat P My eyes ! I'll go and bring in&#xD;
his duds, an' he'll give us a drink !"&#xD;
&#xD;
The man, though not drunk now, shuffled out&#xD;
of the door down to the water-stairs with that&#xD;
&#xD;
e weak-kneed gait which belongs to the confirmed&#xD;
s inebriate, like a child just beginning to learn to&#xD;
y walk.&#xD;
y    Captain Ned, who was smoking a cigar be-&#xD;
;hind his tap, and had just ordered a negro slave&#xD;
e to light up, rose quickly and countermanding&#xD;
f the order, walked briskly to the window, mut-&#xD;
o tering to himself, as if with pleasing expecta-&#xD;
tion:&#xD;
"It is he, I'll bet a Spanish peso. I'll keep&#xD;
dark a few minutes longer, till he gets housed,&#xD;
for he don't care to be seen."&#xD;
From the window, he saw through the obscu-&#xD;
f rity the outlines of the boat and persons in her,&#xD;
as she touched the stairs, but could make out&#xD;
nothing. Only one person got out of the boat,&#xD;
who came up the stairs and entered the tap,&#xD;
though not without a certain hesitation in his&#xD;
manner, and a searching glance around and&#xD;
within. It was, however, the usual supper hour&#xD;
of its frequenters, and it was deserted, save by&#xD;
one man, who sat in one corner, smoking a&#xD;
German pipe.&#xD;
At the door Captain Ned met the stranger,&#xD;
and saying in an indifferent tone, "Binnacle,"&#xD;
he was promptly and in the same tone answered&#xD;
by the other "Light."&#xD;
You are welcome," said Blouster, extend-&#xD;
ing his hand to the man, whose face was conceal-&#xD;
ed by the upright collar of a sea watch-coat, that&#xD;
cane as high as his temples, and nearly met in&#xD;
front of his eyes. "I am glad to see you, sir.&#xD;
Follow me !"&#xD;
The other, without a word, walked after him&#xD;
across the tap room, on the opposite side of which&#xD;
was a door, which the host opened, and admit-&#xD;
ting him, closed it. after him and bolted it.--&#xD;
" Sit down-I will get a light, sir."&#xD;
- " No, Blouster," answered the other, in a&#xD;
voice that evidently belonged to a young man,&#xD;
and one who mingled in good society ; for it had&#xD;
that bred and polished tone, which is not easily-&#xD;
described, but which can be understood by all.&#xD;
"No, we can talk in the dark."      -1&#xD;
" That we can, sir ; but I must first get the&#xD;
&#xD;
time from my duties. I will return to you in a&#xD;
moment."&#xD;

THE DANCING STAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Bring me a tumbler of brandy at the same&#xD;
time.  I have been on the water-this three&#xD;
hours, and so much water about makes. one thirs-&#xD;
ty enought"&#xD;
"First, before I go, I will ask, are you&#xD;
successful?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
" That is good news. I will be in again after&#xD;
a few moments."&#xD;
hus'speaking, the host left the small, old-&#xD;
fashioned parlor, in which he had left his guest,&#xD;
and entering the tap through the little stooping&#xD;
door back of it, underneath the shelves, he- call-&#xD;
ed to light up. The slave kindled two candles&#xD;
on the mantel piece, and a lamp on each side of&#xD;
the half-moontap, the light from which gave a&#xD;
cheerful and home-like aspect to the long room.&#xD;
The African then took a chair, by which he was&#xD;
enabled to reach a small panel, on hinges, above&#xD;
the chief entrance.  Upon opening it, there&#xD;
was visible  a binnacle-lamp, placed in a box&#xD;
within, and directly behind the painting which&#xD;
we have described as being above the door.-&#xD;
.The picture being transparent, the 'light shone&#xD;
through; and to persons in the street the starfish&#xD;
was as brilliant as a genuine.light in the binna-&#xD;
cle. When the negro had kindled this sign to&#xD;
the neighborhood that the evening in the tap-&#xD;
room  had fairly commenced, the gossips who&#xD;
usually congregated there of evenings to smoke,&#xD;
drink ale, and talk over everything that trans-&#xD;
pired, began to direct their steps towards the&#xD;
inn.&#xD;
"sWivil," said the host, after he had seen the&#xD;
lights were all right, addressing the seedy look-&#xD;
ing individual whom we have described as stand-&#xD;
ing by the window on the arrival of the boat in&#xD;
which the stranger had come.&#xD;
"'Ere, cap'n !" he answered, hurrying to&#xD;
wards him with the fawning simper of a poor&#xD;
creature who lives on the bountyof another.&#xD;
" You keep bar-do you hear ?"&#xD;
" I'll do it, eap'n."&#xD;
" And don't touch a drop ; if you do, you'll&#xD;
&#xD;
not.have a drop from me for a week."&#xD;
"I wont drain even the sugerin', cap'n, blow&#xD;
me if I do. I know when a gentl'n is a gentl'n&#xD;
&#xD;
-an' I guess I've been a gentl'n, if I arn't&#xD;
now. To be sure I'll, keep the bar--who but&#xD;
Wivil?- .That's my name, "Tim Wivil--good as&#xD;
gold. To be sure I will I"&#xD;
" Don't you trust a soul, Wivil," said the&#xD;
captain, as he pouredout half a tumnbler of his&#xD;
best brandy, the sight of which made Tim's eyes&#xD;
water so that he had to wipe his cheeks with&#xD;
his cufE-&#xD;
"No I wont-not I. 0, cap'n, that brandy&#xD;
looks like as if it 'uld make a dead feller git rite&#xD;
up out o' his coffin to smell it !  I say, Cap'n&#xD;
Blouster, what gentl'n was that, hey ?"&#xD;
"Did you ever see him before, Tim?" asked&#xD;
the captain, with a sharp look at him.&#xD;
"Can't say-,-couldn't see his face.  Guess&#xD;
he's a reveny chap, ain't he?  Looks like a&#xD;
reveny boat."&#xD;
"Mind your own business, Wivil."&#xD;
"I'linind yourn, sir, fast, if you please,"&#xD;
answered Wivil, with a grin, going behind the&#xD;
tap.  ".I haint nobody else's to mind, havin'&#xD;
none o' my own in pertickelar to 'tend to. Ah,&#xD;
bless us ! this 'ere round little tap smells like&#xD;
a flower gardin," added the toper, snuffing and&#xD;
smelling with gusto the rummy atmosphere of&#xD;
the bar, after Blouster had disappeared. " 0,&#xD;
what a place for a sinner !  'Ere's paradise !-&#xD;

&#xD;
You mean the young girl on Windmill point&#xD;
above here."&#xD;
"Yes ; and you will see that your words shall&#xD;
come true even in this.  It, is the only thing in&#xD;
which I have been foiled ; but I mean to carry&#xD;
it out, after our other matters are arranged."&#xD;
"The brother was in here to-day.'"&#xD;
'ieaufort !" exclaimed the stranger, with&#xD;
fierceness.&#xD;
"Yes. He left" not five hours ago for the&#xD;
inlet."&#xD;
What was he doing here ? I fancied he&#xD;
thought too much of himself-the low-born&#xD;
hound--to enter a tap-room."&#xD;
He was brought in by Lieutenant Mainwar-&#xD;
iigor rather they walked in talking, and sat&#xD;
down and held a long parieying about his joining&#xD;
the revenue."&#xD;
Heaven grant he did consent to do it."&#xD;
"I don't know, but rather think not. You&#xD;
know I always keep my ears open, and my bari&#xD;
is so constructed,-hollow  behind,-that I&#xD;
catch, when I am in it, almost the lowest whis&#xD;
-:per men utter at any of the tables. He seemed&#xD;
to draw off, and parted without coming to any&#xD;
terms. -Mr. Mainwaring once told me that he&#xD;
had taken a liking to Beaufort, and thought him&#xD;
one of the most promising - young bay men that&#xD;
ever enter York river. He says he is a capital&#xD;
sailor, and as brave as a lion, and possesses every&#xD;
honorable trait in his character a man need&#xD;
have!"&#xD;
"He will spoil a parson in him, then, if he&#xD;
take him into his cutter," said the guest sneer-&#xD;
ingly, as if he liked but ill this praise of an up-&#xD;
right young fellow. "If he gets into the rev-&#xD;
erdue, we may one day meet, when T shall not be&#xD;
backward in paying off old scores. But let&#xD;
Eim pass," he added, haughtily, " one thing&#xD;
at the time. My news is this~ Blouster. I had&#xD;
no sooner reached Baltimore, than I looked&#xD;
about the harbor for such a vessel as we fixed&#xD;
upon; but not finding one, all having too great&#xD;
tonnage, I was afraid I should have to wait till&#xD;
one could be built ; and as luck would have it,&#xD;
&#xD;
when I had received your letter, saying I had&#xD;
best contractat once to have the keel laid, a&#xD;
&#xD;
little clipper of seventy tons-as pretty a crea-&#xD;
ture as ever swam the blue water-came into&#xD;
port from a trip to Pensacola on a coast survey.&#xD;
Upon inquiry, I found that she was sent home&#xD;
as drawing too much water, and her place was&#xD;
to be supplied by a craft of less tonnage and&#xD;
lighter draught. The clipper was, therefore, for&#xD;
sale, and three weeks ago I purchased her, and&#xD;
paid for her just as she was, in sea trim, even&#xD;
to her provisions on board !"&#xD;
How much did you pay for her complete?"&#xD;
asked the host, with the look of a man who has&#xD;
a deep pecuniary interest in knowing the answer&#xD;
to his question.&#xD;
"Four thousand and six hundred."&#xD;
"It is not too much if she is sound."&#xD;
"Sound as a racer ; not a blemish in her&#xD;
from stem to stern."&#xD;
"You have made a bargain."&#xD;
"You will say so when you see her."&#xD;
" And what have you expended of the remain-&#xD;
der of the six thousand ?"&#xD;
" I have victualled the vessel for four months,&#xD;
shipped a crew of eighteen men, and paid them&#xD;
a month's advance each, and two ofieers, both&#xD;
of them reckless rascals ; and as for my crew, it&#xD;
is motley-such as I could get and knew I could&#xD;
trust."&#xD;
"This was the most difficult pert of your&#xD;
business.&#xD;
"That is true ; but I had i6y first man in&#xD;
Lastels."&#xD;
" A precious rogue !"&#xD;
"That he is-worth his weight in ingots.&#xD;
With Lastels, who had run his career in Balti-&#xD;
more, and who knew half a score of as desper-&#xD;
ate, fortune-tossed gentry as himself, I secured&#xD;
these through him; and then, as each of these&#xD;
knew others of like calibre, unknown to Lastel,&#xD;
I made each of them bring a man. By this&#xD;
scheme I got my eighteen men all of one stamp,&#xD;
and ready to ship and ask no questions-glad,&#xD;
every mother's son of them; to find some way-&#xD;
of getting out of' the city, for they were victims&#xD;
of debt, and had of' late seen the streets only by&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
The "Binnacle's" motley customers.         suspicious stranger.   Bluster's efforts to be&#xD;
rid of him.    A surprise.    " To are my    prisonerr"    The police off cer foiled.-&#xD;
The boats and a desperate chase.       The result.&#xD;
&#xD;
ten o'clock, Captain Ned gave orders to&#xD;
t         o his factotum, the .splayfooted negro boy&#xD;
who did the rough-and-tumble work about the&#xD;
tap, to "douse the glim," a nautical phrase&#xD;
well understood by Dick, though he had never&#xD;
seen any other salt water than   the  distant&#xD;
expanse of the Chesapeake seen from the inn&#xD;
wharf. All Bluster's customers, fresh water&#xD;
and salt, also understood the meaning of the or-&#xD;
der; and as Ned was known to be punctual at&#xD;
the hour, and gave no favors, there was a gen-&#xD;
eral movement of the men who happened to be&#xD;
in the room at that moment.&#xD;
Three of these were retired skippers, who&#xD;
talked over reeling blows off the Capes, over a&#xD;
glass of half and-half, often replenished in the&#xD;
course of the yarn by the instrumentality of&#xD;
Dick, who waited-upon the customers.&#xD;
Two of them were mechanics, one a cobbler&#xD;
and the other a tailor, whose evenings for seven&#xD;
years had been passed in the tap, neither of them&#xD;
going home or offering to stir till the order was&#xD;
given to put out the lights ; and then, arm in&#xD;
arm, and equally tipsy, they would help each&#xD;
&#xD;
other home-a pair of Dromios that the love of&#xD;
good liquor, and frowning helpmates at home,&#xD;
united in the closest bonds of sympathy and&#xD;
companionship.&#xD;
One of the sitters was a broken-down merchant,&#xD;
in shining coat sleeves and collar well waxed&#xD;
with age, a grayish hat, but often smoothed with&#xD;
an old wiper, in remembrance of former respect&#xD;
ability, a gray head, thin face, and a nose fiery&#xD;
red at the extremity; a gentleman who lived&#xD;
upon the weekly pittance an industrious daugh-&#xD;
ter, by teaching, bestowed upon him, and which,&#xD;
to drown sorrow, and from fear of looking his&#xD;
misery in the face, he spent at the Binnacle in&#xD;
strong potations.. But he was never drunk, and&#xD;
the more he drank,-and he drank much, for&#xD;
many asked him out of respectful-commisera-&#xD;
tion, and in consideration that he had once own-&#xD;
ed warehouses and ships, to walk up and take&#xD;
something with them,-he seemed the more sad.&#xD;
Everybody paid him a sort. of deference, for he&#xD;
was always neat, though he wore the garb of&#xD;
poverty, and mine host would always hand him&#xD;
the morning papers before anybody else.&#xD;
&#xD;
These persons, with Wivil, were usually the&#xD;
last in going away; and though others might&#xD;
sometimes stay as long as they did, they were&#xD;
never known, not one of them, to rise to depart&#xD;
before the order was given to douse the lights!&#xD;
When it was now given, there was an eighth&#xD;
individual seated in the corner near the window,&#xD;
sipping his negus. He had come in about an&#xD;
hour before, and instead of going up to the bar&#xD;
to order what he wanted, had proceeded to this&#xD;
corner, which he seemed to select as being more&#xD;
obscure than any other part of the tap-room.--&#xD;
He had received his glass through the agency&#xD;
of Dick, whom he had called to him to give the&#xD;
order. The man was tall and powerfully made,&#xD;
with huge black whiskers, long black hair flow-&#xD;
ing on his shoulders, and a short bushy beard on&#xD;
his lips and chin-in a word, bearded like a&#xD;
Pard. His entrance had attracted general at-&#xD;
tention, but as one eye after another rested on&#xD;
him without recognition, it was turned away&#xD;
again without remark, for Blouster had often&#xD;
strange visitors in his tap-room. Captain Ned,&#xD;
however, regarded him a second time with closer&#xD;
attention than his guests, who were occupied&#xD;
talking and drinking, had done; and he felt a&#xD;
curiosity to know who he was, as he always did&#xD;
if there was anything striking about any of the&#xD;
strangers that entered the tap-room. He there-&#xD;
fore took Dick's duty upon him when the glass&#xD;
was ordered to be replenished, and carried it&#xD;
from the bar to him; but the man, while he re-&#xD;
ceived the glass with his extended hand, was&#xD;
looking out of the window, as if gazing intently&#xD;
upon some object that that moment had attracted&#xD;
his attention. Blouster did not, therefore, see t&#xD;
his face, and he departed muttering:      I&#xD;
"DIone on purpose. It looks suspicious.--&#xD;
I'll know who he is before he leaves !" r&#xD;
When, therefore, -Blouster saw the man main- p&#xD;
tain his seat till the light in the Binnacle above t&#xD;
the door was put out, he looked uneasy, and e&#xD;
kept glancing towards him where he sat smoking b&#xD;
a pipe, which he had taken from his pocket.- o&#xD;
&#xD;
The decayed gentleman rose first, on seeing Dick w&#xD;
climb the chair to extinguish the lamp, and bow- r&#xD;
ing politely, but with a melancholy air, to mine&#xD;
&#xD;
host, was going out, when Mr. Wivil, who was&#xD;
standing by the bar admiring the sparkle of the&#xD;
liquors through the sides of the decanters, being,&#xD;
as we have seen, an amateur that way, laid his&#xD;
hand with tipsy familiarity on his shoulder, and&#xD;
said :&#xD;
" Come, ole gentl'n, suppose we take a nights&#xD;
cap afore we goes. The cap'n '11 treat, I lnow&#xD;
by his eye."&#xD;
" Sir,"  answered the decayed    merchant,&#xD;
shrinking from the hand laid on his shoulder,&#xD;
and drawing himself up with the wreck of his&#xD;
former pride struggling in his pale features, " I&#xD;
am a gentleman and educated man, sir, and&#xD;
though poor and a drinker, I am not yet so low&#xD;
as to be your companion. Good evening, sir,"&#xD;
and the wasted form of the elderly merchant dis-&#xD;
appeared from - the tap into the gloom. Mr.&#xD;
Wivil looked after him with stupid surprise,&#xD;
and then turning to the landlord, winked at him,&#xD;
and remarked, apologetically:&#xD;
"The gentl'n needn't take offence-I didn't&#xD;
mean nothin' but feller feelin'. I doesn't 'gree&#xD;
with him ! If two gentl'n as tipple aint equals,&#xD;
I never seed a yoke o' steers as was. Every&#xD;
gentl'n to his taste, and my taste is to licker.&#xD;
Cap'n, one more glass-jist a little night-cap,&#xD;
if you please !"&#xD;
" Wivil, you've drank twelve times to-night,&#xD;
if you've drank once."&#xD;
" And wot's twelve times to a man as loves&#xD;
licker ! Bless yer soul, cap'n, I could drink a&#xD;
gross rite off, and cry for more&#xD;
"Don't talk here,! Go !-I must bar up!&#xD;
answered Blouster, testily ; for he was anxious&#xD;
o join the stranger in the little parlor, where he&#xD;
had left him.&#xD;
The two friends, John the cobbler, and Sam-&#xD;
my the tailor, fiow seeing that all the lights were&#xD;
ut out except one on the bar, left their cups at&#xD;
he little round table where they had spent the&#xD;
vening in loving talk about "yven they vos little&#xD;
oys," and arm in arm, with their hats cocked&#xD;
n the same side, their left eye shut, and each&#xD;
ith the right corner of his mouth screwed down,&#xD;
&#xD;
heeled up to the bar.&#xD;
Cobbler.-" Good ni-night, Captin Blowsy."&#xD;
Tailor.-" Go-od night, Cap'n Blow-ser."&#xD;

THE DANCING STAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
Both extended their hands at the same mo-I&#xD;
meant and grasped that of the host, and shook it&#xD;
most affectionately. They then reeled to the&#xD;
right, and then to the left, and finally, like a&#xD;
pair of Siamese twins, ejected themselves from&#xD;
the door and brought up in the middle of the&#xD;
street. Here they spent full five minutes in as-&#xD;
certaining which was up street and which down,&#xD;
and finally moved off, presenting a happy/illus-&#xD;
tration of the motto of their fellow-citizens,-&#xD;
"United we stand, divided we fall !"&#xD;
"There goes a, pressius supple ." soliloquiz&#xD;
ed Wivil, as he saw them depart; "if one o'&#xD;
them men should have the toothake the other 'd&#xD;
have it. They'll die the same day, and be&#xD;
buried in the same grave !"    -&#xD;
The three old skippers, who had lingered to&#xD;
hear out a yarn that one of the numlr had been&#xD;
telling all the evening about "a school o' por&#xD;
poises and a Marblehead fog," now got up, and&#xD;
taking a parting glass, in which Wivil was adroit,&#xD;
enough to be the fourth in the affair, they but,&#xD;
toned up their thick pea-jackets, pulled their tar-&#xD;
paulins over their eyes, and the collars tup about&#xD;
their ears, as if they were going on deck to stand&#xD;
watch in a December snow storm, and thrusting&#xD;
their hands into their pockets up to the elbows,&#xD;
rolled out of the tap one after the other, like&#xD;
three topsail schooners sailing on a bowline in&#xD;
each other's wake, and disappeared up the street&#xD;
on the starboard tack.&#xD;
There remained no one in the dim tap-room&#xD;
nowsave Wivil, who, having no home, hung on&#xD;
to every place he, could stay in with the ends&#xD;
of his elbows and heels, and the large man in&#xD;
the drab coat and Pardic black beard. Blous-&#xD;
ter cast his eyes impatiently towards him several&#xD;
times, and grew each moment more uneasy.-_&#xD;
The man sat joking his pipe as imperturbably&#xD;
as if 'he had not observed the preparations for&#xD;
closing the tap.&#xD;
" Come, Mr. Wivil," said Blouster, in a loud&#xD;
voice, " you must go home, for I am about to&#xD;
shut the doors up ;" and he shot a sharp glance&#xD;
towards the stranger, to see if he would take&#xD;
&#xD;
the hint. - But he never moved a hair, nor.&#xD;
ceased to smoke.-&#xD;
&#xD;
"Home !" repeated Wivil.    "I'd be very&#xD;
much obleeged to enny gentl'n as would have&#xD;
the goodness to tell me the number o' my house,&#xD;
or the street. I've quite forgot it !  Guess my&#xD;
house aint numbered, and they forgot to- put it'&#xD;
down in the D'rectory.  I'm 'fraid it would be&#xD;
two 00, Free street, corner o' Sky alley. Bless&#xD;
you, cap'n, I haint laid in a house these five&#xD;
years!  I sleeps about in spots; sometimes,;&#xD;
when it's warm nights, I lodges comfortable and&#xD;
cool on the spungy side of a market stall; some-&#xD;
times I takes it out on the church steps; but the&#xD;
capitalest place for a feller to sleep in is the&#xD;
churchyard, rite on one slab, with another cover-&#xD;
in' him over to keep the dew off, and with plenty&#xD;
bushes stuck round on the windy side, and grass&#xD;
under you, it's comfortable till purty late in the&#xD;
season; but in winter I takes to hay-lofts. If&#xD;
you never slep in a hay-mow, cap'n, you don't&#xD;
know what's nice and comfurtable, 'specially if&#xD;
a hen comes an' lays a egg rite alongside o'&#xD;
your head, for you to breakfast on. That's wot&#xD;
Icalls luxury and livin' independent.  But I&#xD;
sees you're wantin' me to go. Good night,&#xD;
cap'n !" and here turning to the stranger, Mr.&#xD;
Wivil touched his ragged castor, and also wished&#xD;
him a good night. The man responded in a&#xD;
frank, bluff, deep base, "Good night to you,&#xD;
too, my lad! Here's a dollar to get you a night's&#xD;
lodging and a breakfast."&#xD;
kith this he tossed him a Spanish dollar,&#xD;
which fell on the floor, rolling at his feet. Mr.&#xD;
Wivil stood still and gazed upon it, with incred-&#xD;
ulous marvel in every lineament of his rum-&#xD;
blossomed face.  He then took it up, and hav-&#xD;
ing examined it, he was about to thrust into his&#xD;
trowsers, but recollecting that pockets he had&#xD;
none, he held it in the closed hand with the grasp&#xD;
of a vice, while he made a miscellaneous sort of&#xD;
a bow, saying: .&#xD;
" Thank ye, sir. It's a long day since Tim-&#xD;
othy Wivil had such a sum o' money as this.&#xD;
Sir, you knoir how to 'preciate distressed virtue&#xD;
and individooals in distress. Sir, may you live&#xD;
&#xD;
a thousand years!  I'll drink your health every&#xD;
time I licker till I die !  Good night, every&#xD;
body. If I don't show this white dollar to every&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
ter had been all his life an upright and honest&#xD;
liver, he would not now have felt any misgivings&#xD;
at the sight of a strangr, however suspicious&#xD;
and mysterious he might seem ; but a guilty&#xD;
conscience never sleeps. It is always active to&#xD;
listen, to mark, to suspect, to doubt, to detect,&#xD;
to imagine, to convert all doubtful circumstances&#xD;
into agents that are about to unveil his secret.&#xD;
Thus it is that.a consciousness of crime commit-&#xD;
ted makes the hardiest man a living coward from&#xD;
the lively apprehension of detection. Tbe shadow&#xD;
of an act of wrong done in early years will cast&#xD;
its shadow along the whole path of a man's life.&#xD;
and, uncepented, gather in a dread darkness&#xD;
about his dying hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
formidable attitude of defence, so quickly taken,&#xD;
and while he manifested equal resolution of man-&#xD;
n, r, neither drawing aside before the levelled&#xD;
pistols, nor abating one inch of his ground, he&#xD;
evidently thought it best to parley. To his de-&#xD;
miand he had received -no other reply than the&#xD;
silent eloquence of the determined attitude we&#xD;
have described.&#xD;
"Nevil Beachampe, I do not desire to proceed&#xD;
to extremities. I arrest you in the name of the&#xD;
State government, for forging the-"&#xD;
Before he got farther, Blouster, who had hast-&#xD;
ily barred his outer door, and taken an immense&#xD;
African knife from a shelf above the bar, sprang&#xD;
into the room behind the stranger, and, coming&#xD;

With this resolution,' the goo -natured but  " I never turn my taproom  into a lodging-&#xD;
good for-nothing Master Tim Wivil left the tap- ball," answered Blouster, sullenly.  ":Come,&#xD;

his good fortune.                            same thing twenty times, as if he were watching&#xD;
There was not a word spoken in the tap until pome particular object on the river-though it&#xD;

he would depart.   His perplexity was put an   Scarcely were the words out of his mouth,&#xD;
end to as the song ceased, by the man saying: when the man, who had turned his eyes towards&#xD;

with you to night !     -                   rose and sprung forward to it almost at a bound.&#xD;
"I am sorry to say, sir, we are full," an- But a cry of alarm and warning from Blouster&#xD;
swered Blouster, on theimpulse of the moment; made the young man shut to the door quickly ;&#xD;
for he had taken a prejudice against the man  but before lie could bolt it, it was burst open,&#xD;
he felt, he knew not why, a secret dread of him, and the stranger entered,.pistol in hand.&#xD;
and he resolved, though there were three spare  " You are my prisoner, sir !" he cried, as&#xD;

Moreower, he had to leave the inn in a few arrr two pistols, and threw himself into a most strik-&#xD;

THE DANCING STAR&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DANCING STAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
near unseen, struck to the ground the pistol that&#xD;
he held, and before he could redeem  it, threw&#xD;
himself before him, in an attitude of terrible fe -&#xD;
rocity, his stiff, gray hair almost alive with fury,&#xD;
his eyes blazing with rage and madness, and the&#xD;
gleaming, double-edged broad knife raised above&#xD;
his head ready to strike.  The stranger drew&#xD;
back, but did not show a sign of fear-it was&#xD;
evidently not in him.&#xD;
"Who are you that dare attack one of my&#xD;
guests in my own house ?" demanded Blouster,&#xD;
the mischievous blood in him fairly up. " By&#xD;
all the fiends, I will rip thy heart out !"&#xD;
It was a moment in which the nerves of the&#xD;
stoutest of men might well have quivered, for&#xD;
besides the knife above him, and which he had&#xD;
no weapon in his hand to ward off,'the captain&#xD;
of the Dancing Star still covered his heart with&#xD;
the muzzles of the two pistols.  The stranger&#xD;
had got himself into a dilemma which he evi-&#xD;
dently felt would require the utmost skill and&#xD;
coolness to extricate himself from  alive.  He&#xD;
knew that he was in the presence of desperate&#xD;
men, who felt themselves compromised, and&#xD;
would not hesitate to kill him to save their own&#xD;
persons and preserve their own secrets.&#xD;
" Gentlemen," said he, calmly, "you have&#xD;
the advantage of me. I confess myself foiled,&#xD;
for once.  With your permission L will bid you&#xD;
a very good night."&#xD;
" Not so easy, sir," answered Blouster.-&#xD;
"You have attempted to commit an act of vio-&#xD;
lence in my house, and you shall answer for it."&#xD;
"Let him go, Ned," said the young Oman,&#xD;
putting ui his pistols.  " He can do us no harm&#xD;
now.   Shall in ten minutes be beyond the reach&#xD;
of danger from offers of the law. I see, sir, you&#xD;
are only doing your duty, arnd you have done it&#xD;
bravely. I have no quarrel with you, if you let&#xD;
me alone. You are at liberty to go."&#xD;
"And you act like a gallant fellow, Beach-&#xD;
ampe, arnd I acknowledge that T am fairly beat-&#xD;
en. It is not your fault that I do not have these&#xD;
bracelets on your hands. But we shall meet&#xD;
another time, and be better acquainted."&#xD;
&#xD;
Nevil Beachampe smiled disdainfully, and&#xD;
going up to Blouster, 'took hold of his arm that&#xD;
&#xD;
still held the knife and lowered it gently. "That&#xD;
will d.; 'let us go."&#xD;
"You are, too careless. You were reckless&#xD;
in venturing ashore, and should have sent Las-&#xD;
tels. - No, no ! This officer can do mischief; I&#xD;
shall not let him go from my sight to-night. I&#xD;
must look out for my own safety as well," an-&#xD;
sWered Blouster, in a low half tone.  " What&#xD;
hie has seen to-night, that I have harbored you,&#xD;
will compromise ipe. He must not blab it-not&#xD;
he !"&#xD;
"He has discovered nothing-he has only&#xD;
seen that you have taken, as becomes a good&#xD;
landlord, the part of your guest. He knows&#xD;
nothing to hurt you."&#xD;
" I am not so sure. Leave him to me !"&#xD;
"Do as, you please," answered Beachampe,"&#xD;
in a tone of indifference.&#xD;
The police chief, for it was the most.celebrat-&#xD;
ed police officer of that day in the land who had&#xD;
attempted this bold arrest, stood the while. in,&#xD;
the midst of the room, Blouster being between&#xD;
him and the door. His eye/had lost none of its&#xD;
courage, and he seemed to be equal, unarmed&#xD;
as he was, to the emergency. , He heard all&#xD;
they said.&#xD;
"Master Blouster," he said, quietly, " I see&#xD;
you fear that your name as host of the Binnacle&#xD;
is going to suffer for what you are enacting, and&#xD;
so you meditate mischief.  Now let me tell you&#xD;
plainly that I know you! I have..discovered&#xD;
nothing to-night new to me.' I have long known&#xD;
you were disposed to harbor lawless guests.-&#xD;
But.I shall not trouble you unless I have a-war-&#xD;
rant for you, which I have not.. As I have&#xD;
kept your secret, having had you under suspi-&#xD;
cion, I can keep it still. I am not surprised at&#xD;
your fence of Beachampe, and I well knoW it&#xD;
is n/so iluch as your guest as jour comrade."&#xD;
" Who are you?"&#xD;
" That .is neither here nor there. I know&#xD;
you ! I do not fear you ! I will niot injure&#xD;
you, except in the way of my duty. Now you&#xD;
see that you wil-1 do no good nd gain nothing,&#xD;
by putting that villanous lo -ing knife between&#xD;
&#xD;
my ribs. So with your ieave, as you have the&#xD;
best of it to-night, I will take my departure."&#xD;
&#xD;
Blouster slowly turned the point of his knife&#xD;
towards the floor, and looking at the tall brave&#xD;
man inquiringly, said&#xD;
"You are     brave man and fearless, and I&#xD;
love a brave man ; and as Mister Beachampe&#xD;
says, you are only doing your duty, I will trust&#xD;
you. But before you go, tell me who you are.&#xD;
You are not an ordinary policeman ?"&#xD;
" There is my name on my warrant," said&#xD;
he, exhibiting it to the eyes of Blouster, who no&#xD;
sooner glanced at it, than he turned deadly pale,&#xD;
the knife fell from his grasp, and he started back&#xD;
with a cry of terror that made Beachampe's&#xD;
blood run cold. The officer took up his pistol,&#xD;
and passing the statue-like landlord, crossed the&#xD;
tap-room, unbarred the door, and went out with-&#xD;
out even looking behind.&#xD;
"What is the matter, Blouster?  Why, man,&#xD;
you are as pale as death !" cried Beachampe.&#xD;
"Thank Heaven he 'is now gone ! Do you&#xD;
know-" Here he gasped, and his voice sunk&#xD;
into his chest.&#xD;
" Know what?"&#xD;
"I killed that man once !"&#xD;
"Ned, you are beside yourself. You have'&#xD;
been taking wine."&#xD;
" Yet I couldn't have killed him, or-- Do&#xD;
you believe the dead come back ?" he asked, in,&#xD;
a tone of horror that awed the young man, who&#xD;
gazed on him with amazement.&#xD;
I believe no such thing."&#xD;
"He didn't die then !  Yet I stabbed him to&#xD;
the heart, and threw him into the sea ! I saw&#xD;
the waters close over him ! Nevil Beachampe,&#xD;
the person you saw here but now was no living&#xD;
man ! I see it all; I shall not live-it is a&#xD;
warning."&#xD;
" Take some brandy. Here, I did diot drink&#xD;
half of it-you need it-you are ill. He was&#xD;
savesi somehow."&#xD;
'The' young man poured some brandy down&#xD;
his throat, and the host revived and looked more&#xD;
composed.&#xD;
" Yes, he must have been," he answered,&#xD;
relieved. " I could not have killed him. It&#xD;
&#xD;
is very strange !"&#xD;
" Well, let us forget it.&#xD;
&#xD;
I can't stay here ;&#xD;
&#xD;
he has not bound himself not to try and secure&#xD;
me otherwheres-let us to my boat. I would&#xD;
not like to-be dragged off to a prison on that old&#xD;
affair."&#xD;
" I will go with you. I want to see you off,&#xD;
for if you are taken all I've adventured is lost."&#xD;
"Just so," answered Beachampe, with a com-&#xD;
pression of his lips. " Now take a pistol, and&#xD;
let us both go out on our guard. Ten to one he&#xD;
may try toprevent me "frem reaching my boat,&#xD;
if he sees me go out."&#xD;
"We can pass out secretly. Follow me."&#xD;
He took up the candle, but-his hand shook so&#xD;
that Beachampe took it from him, but Blouster&#xD;
led the way down a stone staircase into the wine&#xD;
vault. This they crossed, and came to a small&#xD;
door, by which they issued upon the wharf. All&#xD;
was still. After listening a moment, they went&#xD;
forward to the stairs, where Beachampe found&#xD;
his boat and three of the men asleep, but the&#xD;
fourth was awake and watching.&#xD;
" I thought it was you, sir, a few minutes&#xD;
ago ; but it was a man who had a boat at the&#xD;
wharf end, and he has got into it and pulled&#xD;
down the river.&#xD;
"Was he a tall man?" asked Nevil.&#xD;
"Yes, sir, and came out of the inn."&#xD;
"It is he," said both Blouster and the young&#xD;
man, in the same breath. -" Who had he with&#xD;
him ?" demanded the latter, as he stepped into&#xD;
his boat.&#xD;
.3, " Four men, sir ; two of whom have teen&#xD;
lurking about outside the Binnacle, as if watch-&#xD;
ing out or were finding a place to break in and&#xD;
steal."&#xD;
" He had men with him, and now I see what&#xD;
he was looking out of the windoW for and took&#xD;
his seat there. It was a regular plot to take&#xD;
you. But how could he know you were here?"&#xD;
asked Blouster, as the men shoved out from the&#xD;
stairs, and let fall their oars into the water.&#xD;
" I saw a boat far astern of me, pulling along&#xD;
after mnecjust before I reached the wharf here,"&#xD;
observed Beachampe, " and I have no doubt it&#xD;
&#xD;
was he in pursuit; and knowing I had landed&#xD;
here, he waited till I should come out to take&#xD;
boat again to arrest me.&#xD;

&#xD;
30&#xD;
&#xD;
" That is the way of it," said' Blouster, in a&#xD;
faint, almost absent, sort of manner, as if the&#xD;
re-appearance of the man he had.long believed&#xD;
dead still troubled his mind with anxious and&#xD;
superstitious doubts.&#xD;
"Did you take your pistol'?"&#xD;
"Have it ready.  One of mine I have in my&#xD;
hand, and my cuthass loosened for service. Do&#xD;
you know I expect that we shall see our friend&#xD;
again. He is not a man to give me up without'&#xD;
another trial; and you must understand, Blous.&#xD;
ter, that I am not to be taken."&#xD;
"No, you must not be taken--that would&#xD;
ruin me!",&#xD;
"Then be yourself and stand by me! Is&#xD;
that infernal ghost fear upon you yet."&#xD;
I can't shakeit off!"&#xD;
"Then it would be a good thing if you could'&#xD;
get a broken head from him by way of assurance&#xD;
of his being bone and muscle.  Now, my lads,&#xD;
give way strong and long !" he added, as the&#xD;
boat cleared the dock and shot past the head of&#xD;
the wharf out into the open stream. The keen&#xD;
eye of the young man surveyed the river below&#xD;
to see if there were any sign of another boat on&#xD;
the. water, and bending his face low close to the&#xD;
water, he cast his glance along the surface; but&#xD;
before he raised his head, he was startled by a&#xD;
cry of surprise from Blouster.&#xD;
It was caused by a boat that shot like an ar-&#xD;
row out from beneath the dark arches of the&#xD;
pier. In the stern stood upright the tall figure&#xD;
of the unknown.&#xD;
"Pull for your lives, men !-stoop to your&#xD;
oars !  This is life or death !  Now, Blouster,&#xD;
S you shall kno  whether your friend be flesh or&#xD;
,spirit." ie rose to his feet with his pistol&#xD;
cocked and levelled at the dark figure which the&#xD;
starlight revealed.&#xD;
SBoth boats were now flying along the water&#xD;
With inconceivable speed. The pursuer had&#xD;
just missed cutting off t le boat in which Beach&#xD;
ampe and the host were, by half a length, cross&#xD;
&#xD;
ing her wake a few feet astern as she shot out&#xD;
from the whaif, instead of striking her with her&#xD;
bow on her quarter, as his intention evidently&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
was. Missing the charge, it had therefore to,&#xD;
follow hard astern, and make a stern chase of&#xD;
it.  Not a word was interchanged by either&#xD;
party, for each knew well the other's purpose.&#xD;
Blouster stood over the four men, encouraging&#xD;
them with his voice and promises of reward, and&#xD;
in his anxiety to, escape, forgot his ghostly fears.&#xD;
His resolution returned, and in the few words&#xD;
he from time to time spoke with Beachainpe, the&#xD;
latter saw that he was to be depended on. The&#xD;
young man never took his eye from the faintly-&#xD;
seen face of his pursuer, but with his pistol on&#xD;
the full cock, and presented at him, he watched&#xD;
his every movement   The wharves, the houses-&#xD;
of the town were rapidly left behind, and they&#xD;
shot past the lonely and barren banks of the&#xD;
river with great speed, and about twenty yards&#xD;
apart.&#xD;
The chase had continued in this manner for&#xD;
full a mile, when Blouster whispered hoarsely&#xD;
in the ear of the young man, " Let as both fire&#xD;
and finish this business. It is lonely out here&#xD;
on the water, and no one will hear the pistols."'&#xD;
'' No-.let him come on. In half an hour the&#xD;
schooner will be within hail, and theA we shall&#xD;
have him in a trap.  But if he gains on us, anul&#xD;
is likely to come up, I will fire and wing him, if&#xD;
I ca see to do it. I wont kill a man if [can&#xD;
h    it.  Give way merrily, men&#xD;
At this instant the starboard bow oar snapped,&#xD;
and the bows of the boat were pulled by the two&#xD;
larboard oars broadside round before this catas-&#xD;
trophe could be prevented. The boat astern,&#xD;
which was a long, narrow, sharp-nosed whaler,&#xD;
coming on at full head, struck her directly abaft&#xD;
the after starboard row lock. Blouster and two&#xD;
of the men sprung to fend her off, by which&#xD;
they but partially broke the shock. The stern-&#xD;
sheets of both boats swung together, and brought&#xD;
Beachamnpe face to face with his pursuer, who&#xD;
leaped into his boat, exclaiming:&#xD;
" Now, Nevil Beachampe, you are surely my&#xD;
prisoner !"&#xD;
He laid his hand as he spoke upon the, young&#xD;
man's shoulder, when the darkness was illumin-&#xD;
&#xD;
ated by a crimson flash, and the report of Blous-&#xD;
ter's pistol rung in their ears. In the difficulty&#xD;
&#xD;
of aiming at such a time, the ball missed its&#xD;
mark, and the officer responded by placing his&#xD;
pistol close against the breast of the host, and,&#xD;
drawing  the trigger.  As he discharged it,&#xD;
Beachampe struck it up, and with his own pis.&#xD;
tol shot the officer through the body. le fell&#xD;
headlong over into the river.&#xD;
"Grasp him when he comes up !" cried Ne-&#xD;
vil, " for he may not be mortally wounded. I&#xD;
don't want to kill him if he can be saved."&#xD;
"-Better let him alone," answered Blouster,&#xD;
fiercely.  " If he comes up alive, and goes&#xD;
ashore,.I shall never dare set foot in the Light&#xD;
in the Binnacle again."&#xD;
Every eye watched to see him rise between&#xD;
the two boats, but they saw him no more. The&#xD;
boat which had brought him, the men in which&#xD;
had remained passive at their oars, now attempt-&#xD;
ed to pull away as if by one impulse acting on&#xD;
the minds, of the oarsmen, but Blouster's hand&#xD;
grasped the gunwale and held her.&#xD;
"We mustn't let these men escape," he said,&#xD;
with that savage selfishness which his fear of&#xD;
exposure aroused in his breast.&#xD;
"What shall we do with them ?" asked&#xD;
Beachampe.&#xD;
"We must take them on board and keep them&#xD;
in irons, till we decide what to do with them."&#xD;
These words were hardly uttered before the&#xD;
rowers, one after the other, leaped into the rivers&#xD;

shore.  In the darkness they were lost to the&#xD;
eye immediately-or could they be heard, they&#xD;
swam so noiselessly . Blouster, mu' tered curses&#xD;
Cloud and deep, and would have endeavored to&#xD;
retake them; but Beachampe opposed any fur-&#xD;
ther detention, and the former, satisfied that it&#xD;
would be impossible to find them all, suffered&#xD;
the boat to proceed, and the other being cast off&#xD;
adrift, they once more continued their course&#xD;
,down the river.&#xD;
After half an hour's row, during which they&#xD;
talked over the tragic events which had just&#xD;
transpired, they reached the mouth of the river&#xD;
and their little boat began to dance upon the "&#xD;
rolling billows of the Chesa peake. A mile far-1I&#xD;
other out they came in sight of the Dancing Star, 7&#xD;
which was lying to under her jih iin a light wind.&#xD;
A starlike lantern, suspended above her stern,&#xD;
undulated and waved from side to side with the'&#xD;
heaving of the ground swell. on wlhicth the little&#xD;
vessel was gracefully riding, anl at a distance&#xD;
looked like a star dancing on the sea, rendering&#xD;
'her worthy of her name.&#xD;
Upon being hailed, and answering satisfacto-&#xD;
rily, they were suffered to approae. an in a&#xD;
few minutes the captain and owner of the Dane-&#xD;
ing Star were standing upon the deck of their&#xD;
vessel.&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
The schooner an4 -its belongings. Articles of agreement. lBlouster's fears again awak-&#xD;
ened.  A troubled s mber.   Reminiscence? of the past. Beachampe's career of iniquity.&#xD;
&#xD;
T was about midnight when Beachampe&#xD;
reached the schooner, which lay to off a&#xD;
headland that in the darkness looked like a high&#xD;
dark cloud resting on the water. There was a&#xD;
gentle breeze blowing up the bay, and the stars&#xD;
sparkled in the sky; wh le here and there in the&#xD;
distance glimmered a starlike spot on the water&#xD;
which indicated the presence ofa vessel.  One&#xD;
ght in particular, far to the south, from its&#xD;
superior brightness attracted Blouster's attention,&#xD;
as soon, as he looked about him after gaining the&#xD;
depk.&#xD;
"That is the revenue cutter's stern light."&#xD;
"So I guessed," answered the young cap-&#xD;
tain; "but she ,'will not trouble me to-night on&#xD;
that tack. She is beating out."&#xD;
"She will not trouble you at all till you are&#xD;
caught smuggling. That is not the thing, not&#xD;
to be trusted-but not to be suspected. Once&#xD;
1et this s /hooner have the revenue's eye on her,&#xD;
and sh' might as well lay on a mud bank, high&#xD;
and -y."&#xD;
" shall  e as secret as you wish, Ned. But&#xD;
yod have not seen my cabin."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am looking at the deck and spars.   So&#xD;
far as I can judge by this light, she is a fine&#xD;
craft.' Bring a bottle-lantern this way, my&#xD;
man," he said, as he approached one of the six&#xD;
pounders, "1 want to exminethem. Th y&#xD;
are capital looking barkers.  And your men,&#xD;
they look like, a- brave set of fellows," added&#xD;
Blouster, as he followed the young captain be-&#xD;
low. At the foot of the companion-way was&#xD;
the foot of the main-mast, encircled by pistols,&#xD;
cutlasses, pikes and muskets in glittering array,&#xD;
and all ready to the hand. . The cabin was&#xD;
handsome, panelled' with maple, and polished&#xD;
like a mirror. -4t had a sofa on one side, a din-&#xD;
ing-table, stools and carpet, and the transuni&#xD;
held glasses and decanters.  Over the transum&#xD;
were crossed a pair of swords with a star  6f&#xD;
pistols in the centre. A few books.lay 'about,&#xD;
a spy-glass, and a chart or two.&#xD;
"This is comfortable, Beachampe," said&#xD;
Blouster, after looking round at everything.&#xD;
" You found all so when you bought her ?"&#xD;
"Yes, books and all. I see you like the&#xD;
vessel."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;

heart's content.  A few adventures well man-&#xD;
aged will yield an enormous return."&#xD;
"It would be a good plan, if possible, to have&#xD;
a friend in the cruiser."&#xD;
"It can't be done. Manwaring, her young&#xD;
captain, is as particular (as can be, and knows&#xD;
every man, or something about every man he&#xD;
ships. But if the cruiser is likely to be trouble-&#xD;
some, means can be found to keep her in port,&#xD;
or cripple her, or keep her from doing us mis-&#xD;
chief. I will kt ep my eye upon her and watch-&#xD;
her every movement. She always makes York&#xD;
her anchorage, and I always know her goings&#xD;
and comings in time to give you warning."&#xD;
"Some further conversation transpired touch-&#xD;
ing minor matters, when Blouster, having drunk&#xD;
with his young captain, rose to go on deck.&#xD;
"You will land me on the point and I can&#xD;
walk up to town," he said. -&#xD;
"{No, I can make sail and run in and set you&#xD;
ashore within a quarter of a mile of the Binna-&#xD;
cle," answered Nevil.&#xD;
"I don't like to have you leave the bay; but&#xD;
as it wont take you long you may do it. But,&#xD;
Beachampe, I would give half I'm   worth to&#xD;
d know that man was in the bottom of the river."&#xD;
"That I will insure you of for a quarter of&#xD;
s what.you are worth, Ned. He went down like&#xD;
lead!"&#xD;
Yes, and ten to one came up like a feather."&#xD;
My pistol was within its length of his heart&#xD;
s when I fired."&#xD;
d " And the ball may have glanced round the&#xD;
ribs, or been flattened against a bone. I wont&#xD;
trust to it. I tell you I saw him fallhedog&#xD;
into the boiling sea in a pitch dark night, a&#xD;
hundred miles from land, and a stab in his body&#xD;
too; and yet I saw him drinking and smoking&#xD;
cmi my tap to-night. It will go hard with me if&#xD;
4 he's alive. He'll be sure to 'peach on me, and&#xD;
then I shall either have to take to the blue wat,-&#xD;
&#xD;
er or be locked in prison. I shall go back and&#xD;
set about to be ready for squalls."&#xD;
"You've nothing to fear; the man is as dead&#xD;
as a stone."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Then the four oarsmen. They might have&#xD;
swum."&#xD;
"Did they know you; or you them?"&#xD;
" I saw them only in the dark.''&#xD;
"And they saw you only in the dark. You&#xD;
are not known to them, be assured. They were&#xD;
only barge men from  Baltimore that brought&#xD;
him down, for the boat was a Baltimore barge&#xD;
"Well,.I begin to breathe easier."&#xD;
They were nowen deck. The vessel still lay&#xD;
to, gently riding the smooth billows. The light&#xD;
which had indicated the presence of the cutter&#xD;
in the distance, was no longer visible. There&#xD;
was a large topsail James' River schooner went&#xD;
sailing sluggishly by within a hundred fathoms,&#xD;
the pipe of the skipper at the wheel glowing&#xD;
like a live coal on the end of his nose. This&#xD;
was the only object moving within range.&#xD;
"Stand by there at the fore sheet. Helm&#xD;
hard up. Ease off and let her fill away," call-&#xD;
ed out the cptain of the Dancing Star.  " We-&#xD;
are going to run into the river."&#xD;
The silence of the vessel was instantly changed&#xD;
to bustle and activity, and the schooner grace-&#xD;
fully laid off to the wind, and curling the water&#xD;
before her prow, went dancing along towards&#xD;
the river, the broad. mouth of which she soon&#xD;
entered. After standing up about a mile or lit-&#xD;
tle more, Blouster insisted on being landed at a&#xD;
low point not far below the town ; as he didn&#xD;
wish by any chance that he should be known to&#xD;
have come from the schooner. The Star came&#xD;
to close in with the land, and Beachampe took&#xD;
leave of him at the gangway, though not until the&#xD;
latter had reiterated his cautions. The boat&#xD;
having landed him and returned, the Dancing&#xD;
Star once more was under canvass, laying her&#xD;
arrowy course out of the river, with Beachampe&#xD;
on her quarter-deck,-feeling, now that Blouster&#xD;
had left, that he was at length the free, sole lord&#xD;
of his swift and beautiful 'cruiser. After he&#xD;
had got once more outside, he laid his course&#xD;
S. S. East, passing near the headland known as&#xD;
Beachampe Head, upon which, a short distance&#xD;
&#xD;
from the sea, darkly rose the mined walls of&#xD;
Beachampe Hall, once the stately home of the&#xD;
young Nevil. He stood upon the deck on the&#xD;
&#xD;
side nighest to the shore, and silently gazed&#xD;
upon the faintly delineated outlines of the home&#xD;
from which he was now an exile.  He sighed as&#xD;
if conscience and an uneasy memory were at&#xD;
work, and turning quickly away with an oath,&#xD;
he mattered&#xD;
" The fiends take the past. I would do it all&#xD;
again. What right had he to disinherit me&#xD;
It is their just due. I have only one prayer,&#xD;
and that is that when my fair cousin fromt over&#xD;
the sea comes to take possession of Beachampe&#xD;
Hall, we may meet on the threshold. From&#xD;
that moment will my destiny be chalked out.&#xD;
Lastels !"&#xD;
" Sir,": answered a slender young man,&#xD;
scarcely-one-and-twenty, who had been watching&#xD;
the southern board through his glass from the&#xD;
gangway.&#xD;
" How many men did you place in a watch?"&#xD;
"Nine, sir."&#xD;
"Did you 'place the men in my watch I&#xD;
named ?"&#xD;
Yes, sir."&#xD;
" I am now going down below to get some&#xD;
sleep till four o'clock, when you will call me.&#xD;
Keep a sharp look-out ; and if you see the rev-&#xD;
enue cutter, or a vessel showing a signal of any&#xD;
kind, awake me at once."&#xD;
"1 will, sir," answered Lastels, with a brev-&#xD;
ity which seemed to be a mark of his, character.&#xD;
Beachampe then went below, and after taking,&#xD;
a heavy draught of undiluted brandy, he threw&#xD;
himself upon the sofa. But he could not sleep.&#xD;
He was restless and seemed to be combating&#xD;
with ugly thoughts. There are times in " the&#xD;
wakefulness of sleep," when the body is weary&#xD;
and the eyes are shut, courting oblivion, that&#xD;
the mind is active, and the very soul of a man&#xD;
seems laid open to the inner eye of his spirit,&#xD;
unconscious of surrojmnding objects, his outward&#xD;
eyes sealed upon them, yet he is not asleep ; but&#xD;
more wakeful than he ever is when -awake.&#xD;
His vision'seems sharpened supernaturally, and&#xD;
he sees everything in a light that no sun ever&#xD;
equalled in clearness. He re-beholds everything&#xD;
&#xD;
he ever did; and is compelled to see each act in&#xD;
all the minuteness and clearness of its most re-&#xD;
&#xD;
volting and hateful details. He tosses arid&#xD;
throws his body from side to side, and struggles&#xD;
to escape these sensations, but in vain ; he can&#xD;
neither wake himself up nor sink into forgetful-&#xD;
ness. His whole soul is laid - open before&#xD;
mental eye, and he is compelled to read it like&#xD;
an open book.&#xD;
Such was the sleep of this youngrman!  The&#xD;
past the past that he wouldbury with all the&#xD;
dead f the past-was lived over again therein ;&#xD;
and all his sins, and all his wrong doing, he did.&#xD;
over again; but with a wonderful addition that&#xD;
he seemed now to be re-committing them as the&#xD;
horrid punishment for having committed them.&#xD;
He was conscious that what once gave him satis-&#xD;
faction in the reality, was now his torment in&#xD;
the dream-like repetition. It was a strange but&#xD;
fearful retribution to him; for great drops of&#xD;
sweat oozed out of his forehead and rolled down&#xD;
his temples, and his brow was contracted as if&#xD;
with the sufferings of Prometheus as the vulture&#xD;
ate out his vitals.&#xD;
We will unveil the past to t he reader's eye,&#xD;
also ; at least such features of it as will throw&#xD;
light upon the present profession of the tortured&#xD;
sleeper.&#xD;
The Beachampe family from which he des&#xD;
cended' is as old as William the Norman; and&#xD;
the name is to be found registered to this day&#xD;
on the roll of Battle-Abbey, with those of the&#xD;
chief knights who aided the conqueror in 'win-&#xD;
ning England at the field of Hastings. In the&#xD;
early settlement of Virginia a knight of the&#xD;
family came over to recruit his straitened for-&#xD;
tunes in the rich plantations of the new world.&#xD;
He left a princely estate to his heirs; but at the&#xD;
revolution, they taking part with the tory fac-&#xD;
tion, it was confiscated. Subsequently, however,&#xD;
for sonme favor done by a Beachampe to Amer-&#xD;
ican prisoners, a portion of it was restored to&#xD;
him, and upon it he built or rather enlarged the'&#xD;
ancient hail on the cliff commanding. a view of&#xD;
the bay. T1pis Beachampe was the grandfather:&#xD;
of our hero. At his death he left the estate to&#xD;
his only son, though he had a daughter who&#xD;
&#xD;
married in England and resided there. This&#xD;
only sen, the father of Nevil, was a noble spee-&#xD;

ingen of a Virginia gentleman. His house was&#xD;
the home of lordly hospitality, and by his cour-&#xD;
tesy and benevolence, he won the respect and&#xD;
regard of all far and wide, Beaufort Beachampe&#xD;
was his name. He had married early in life an&#xD;
accomplished lady of Maryland, and by her&#xD;
had three children, Nevil, the eldest, and a son&#xD;
and daughter younger some years. These were&#xD;
both lost one evening in their childhood, ly be-&#xD;
ing carried out into the bay in a frail boat in&#xD;
which a negro who attended them  had, it was&#xD;
supposed, taken them to row; for they were last&#xD;
seen some distance from the shore, when a white,&#xD;
squall came up, foaming and roaring and sweep-&#xD;
ing every obstacle before it on land and water.&#xD;
This was the last seen of them, and their boat&#xD;
was found next day driven high up the bay&#xD;
bottom upwards. It was some years-before Mr.&#xD;
Beachampe recovered from this severe blow;-&#xD;
and his wife sank under it. The widowed fath-&#xD;
er now placed all his affections upon his only&#xD;
child., Nevil was a lad of itelligenee, daring&#xD;
and spirit, and loved the chas , and to sail upon&#xD;
the bay-. Indulged in every wish by his fond&#xD;
and weak father, he at length became imperious,&#xD;
uncontrollable and unbearable. A tyrant to his&#xD;
servants and slaves, at fourteen, he despised his&#xD;
father's gray hairs, andacted as independent of&#xD;
his wishes as if he were one-and-twenty. By&#xD;
nature passionate and impatient, he could little&#xD;
brook opposition, and he carried everything&#xD;
with so high a hand that finally his quiet-loving&#xD;
father was afraid to cross his wishes. He, nev-&#xD;
ertheless, gave him an unlimited command of&#xD;
money, provided him tutors, who were soon&#xD;
either silenced in a captious spirit by the spoil-&#xD;
ed boy ; or left unable to endure the' petty&#xD;
tyranny anid annoyance, to which they were&#xD;
subjected.&#xD;
In this manner Nevil Beachampe grew up&#xD;
from his twelfth to his eighteenth year. During&#xD;
this time he had learned a little from his tutors ;&#xD;
but he knew more about horses, dogs, guns and&#xD;
boats, fish, rabbits and birds, duck shooting and&#xD;
&#xD;
trout catching, than he did about'books. At&#xD;
length a gentleman and two of his sons,.-about&#xD;
Nevil's age, came from South Carolina to pass a&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DANCING STAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
few days at the hall. These, 'young gentlemen&#xD;
were thoroughly educated in mind and taste ;&#xD;
and were also good hunters, fishers, riders and&#xD;
sailors, for their years.. Every hour showed him&#xD;
his infirmity to them. They conversed of fifty&#xD;
things they had gathered from books, that he&#xD;
was wholly ,ignorant of; and in the drawing-&#xD;
room, when the conversationtook an intellectual&#xD;
turn, he had pride enough. to feel humbled at&#xD;
the consciousness of his own deficiencies. Be-&#xD;
fore his young friends left he had the candor to&#xD;
acknowledge to them how foolish he had been to&#xD;
waste so much time, when he ought to have&#xD;
been improving his mind, .as became a gentle-&#xD;
man's son and heir to a handsome estate. He&#xD;
also asked of the young men to write down for&#xD;
him the titles of every book they had ever&#xD;
studied or read. This they did do so far as&#xD;
they could remember them ; and a formidable&#xD;
long list-it was as it seemed to the young heir.&#xD;
He, however, resolved to have them; and went&#xD;
with them as far as Baltimore, and there bought&#xD;
as many of the books as he could find, and or-&#xD;
dered the balance from New York. For a year&#xD;
he gave himself closely to reading and study, and&#xD;
having a quick, intelligent mind, he was. ena-&#xD;
bled in that, time to make himself acquainted,&#xD;
more or less, perfectly with the contents of all&#xD;
the books. He was now in his twentieth year ;&#xD;
and he resolved to travel. His father gave him&#xD;
drafts and he proceeded to the northern cities,&#xD;
where he commenced a life of gaiety which ere&#xD;
long was changed into the most reckless dissipa-&#xD;
tion. His enormous expenditure of money, the&#xD;
recherche style of his living at gorgeously fur-'&#xD;
nished rooms, his open and unblushing licen-&#xD;
tiousness, rendered .him an object of curiosity&#xD;
and surprise. But suddenly his. career was&#xD;
checked. 'In a gaming hell he lost several&#xD;
thousands in one' night, and ran the winner&#xD;
through the body, and fled. The man did not&#xD;
die, and requisition was not made for Nevil,&#xD;
who sought the seclusion of his home where he&#xD;
resolved to stay till the affair had blown over.&#xD;

TIlE DANCING 'STAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
{&#xD;
&#xD;
a sort of false river, running parallel with the&#xD;
bay four or five miles inland, and terminating at&#xD;
&#xD;
beauty of form and feature surpassing that of&#xD;
any maiden he had ever met with. He uttered"&#xD;
an involuntary exclamation of admiration which&#xD;
caused her to blush and look in another direc-&#xD;
tion. There was also in the beat a negro man&#xD;
forward, and a young man who sat by the fair&#xD;
girl and steered the boat.  The next moment&#xD;
the two boats were far astern of each other ; and&#xD;
though Nevil looked back often and long, he&#xD;
could not get another sight of her face, for 'she&#xD;
did not, as he hoped she would do, turn her&#xD;
head-to look after his boat.&#xD;
"Cato," he said to the negro boy in the boat&#xD;
with him, " whose craft is that ?"&#xD;
"I dummo, mass'," answered the negro&#xD;
with a stutter and lisp combined; "gueth he&#xD;
bumboatee."&#xD;
"That is plain enough.   But whose bum-,&#xD;
boat ?" answered the young man, impatiently.&#xD;
" Dat me dummo, mass,' responded the in-&#xD;
telligent youth, rubbing his eyes as if he had&#xD;
the wisdom of Solomon beneath his woolly pate.&#xD;
"Well, I will find out, that is all.  I see&#xD;
she is steering up the inlet.  They live some-&#xD;
where on its shore.  Stand by to haul after the&#xD;
fore-sheet.  I am going about."&#xD;
The little boat was.in a moment running close'&#xD;
hauled to the wind on the starboard tack, and&#xD;
sailing almost in the track of' the bum-boat,&#xD;
which, as the reader has already surmised, con.&#xD;
tained Elliot Beaufort, his sister -Alice, and&#xD;
Tonef, the gray-headed son of Afric,&#xD;
In order not to be suspected of sailing after&#xD;
them, Beachampe hauled his win4 close, so as&#xD;
rather to keep to windward on his course, while&#xD;
Elliot was steering with the wind four points&#xD;
free. When Beachampe tacked to follow, the&#xD;
two boats were about a quarter of a mile&#xD;
separated.&#xD;
The afternoon was within about an hour of&#xD;
coming to a close, the sun shining brightly low&#xD;
in the west, and spreading the beauty of light&#xD;
and cheerfulness over land and water. We&#xD;
have already described the inlet as an elongation&#xD;
of the mouth of York rivel northward,'or rather&#xD;

map, however, will show better the shape of the&#xD;
water and land thereabouts than the minutest&#xD;
description we can give:.          .   .&#xD;
The speed of the boat which Beachampe&#xD;
steered was soon seen to be superior to that of&#xD;
the bum-boat, which was heavily laden, and was&#xD;
an old affair, not being the handsome natty craft&#xD;
we introduced him to the reader as commanding&#xD;
at a later period ; for the times we are now&#xD;
speaking of are nearly two years prior to the&#xD;
time in which the first chapter of our story opens.&#xD;
Beachampe seeing that he could easily come&#xD;
up with the bum-boat, and not wishing to do so,&#xD;
lay to for awhile, giving her a long lead, and&#xD;
then made sail again. In this manner he kept&#xD;
her in view, while he seemed to them-who&#xD;
were suspicious of no evil-only to be stopping&#xD;
to fish, until they reached the head of the. inlet,&#xD;
and he saw them land on the flat rock at the&#xD;
foot of the path which led up to the mill. With&#xD;
a little river spy-glass which ;he always carried&#xD;
with him, he saw them proceed to the old fortress&#xD;
and disappear within it.&#xD;
"That is where they live, then," he 'said, as&#xD;
he thrust the joints of the spy-glass- together,&#xD;
with emphasis, "and I have found 'a treasure-&#xD;
trove. If that fair maid is a fisher's daughter,&#xD;
she is too beautiful to be thrown away like a&#xD;
jewel among swine in such a place. I must&#xD;
follow up the adventure.  Cato 1"&#xD;

" Throw the bones overboard."&#xD;
" Me keep 'em, mass', for marrner im dem.""&#xD;
" Ease off the fore sheet. That will do-be-&#xD;

I were going to leave, and after it is dark run&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
The family   at the fort. A spy. Alarm of the inmates.&#xD;
devise a plot. His conference with Blouster, and plan of&#xD;
&#xD;
walked all around the fort, and surveyed its po-&#xD;
sition, and then proceeded cautiously to advance&#xD;
into the enclosed, space, where he saw a light&#xD;
gleaming through a window of the dwelling.-&#xD;
He approached with caution, and at length stood&#xD;
in front of the window, against which stood a&#xD;
pair of oars and a broken boat's mast, with a&#xD;
part of a sail hanging to it.  This shielded his&#xD;
person completely, as he peeped between the&#xD;
oars into the room.  The weather being warm,&#xD;
the lower half of the window was raised, and&#xD;
there was nothing to obstruct his vision. A ta-&#xD;
ble was set out, covered with plain, coarse dishes&#xD;
and simple food. Around it sat three persons,&#xD;
a tall woman, with grisly locks, a haggard neck&#xD;
and restless, wild eyes, and her whole appear-&#xD;
ance stern and fanatic. She was eating a piece&#xD;
of corn bread with rapid and fitful chewing, as&#xD;
if she was not conscious what she was about-&#xD;
her eyes in the meanwhile flying around on,&#xD;
every object continually, and not resting upon&#xD;
any particular thing.&#xD;
Beachampe gazed upon her with aurprise,'and&#xD;
not with a little alarm, lest her piercing glance&#xD;
&#xD;
Y the light of the stars, aided by the still&#xD;
/   - pale west, Beachampe reached that side of&#xD;
the old rampart which had been washed away by&#xD;
the rains and nearly levelled with the ground&#xD;
on the outer side ; for, as we have already said,&#xD;
the fort was a ruin, and had been disused many&#xD;
years.  The house was within the enclosure&#xD;
which served as a wall on three sides, while theta&#xD;
fourth was quite open, in the direction of the&#xD;
mill.  Directly back of the house rose the stone-&#xD;
and-earth tower, which had, in the time of the&#xD;
fort's better days, been made use of as a look-&#xD;
out, and to kindle signal-fires upon,-also, to'&#xD;
support the fiag-staf, a stump of which still re-&#xD;
mained.  The chimney of the dwelling, which&#xD;
had been constructed from the debris of the fort,&#xD;
was built directly against the inner side of the&#xD;
tower, which, at a little distance,-looked itself&#xD;
like a gigantic chimney, as the smoke rose above&#xD;
its top. The courtyard, or area of the fort was&#xD;
green, and worn hard with feet, and used partly&#xD;
as a garden and partly as- a place to cure fish.&#xD;
It was to these premises that Beachampe se-&#xD;
cretly stole, under cover of the night. First he&#xD;
&#xD;
should fall upon him. The other two persons&#xD;
were the young man and the young girl he had&#xD;
seen in the boat. The appearance of the former&#xD;
arrested his eyes.  He was struck with the&#xD;
open brow, frank and fearless bearing, and&#xD;
cheerful air with which he ate his supper and&#xD;
talked with his sister, for such was the relation&#xD;
Beachampe knew she must be to him from the&#xD;
resemblance.&#xD;
"That fellow is as courageous as a lion," said&#xD;
he, under his breath, " and I must play my&#xD;
cards cautiously. He has the eye and bearing&#xD;
of a gentleman, with all his coarse apparel and&#xD;
humble life ; and she !-by the eyes of Hebe !'&#xD;
she is handsome enough for a princess. What&#xD;
sweet eyes-how large and full they open, as&#xD;
if innocence and no fear looked out at their&#xD;
azure windows! What rich chestnut hair; what&#xD;
a profile of beauty ! How lovely her neck and&#xD;
virgin bust beneath its homespun boddice !-&#xD;
Free and natural, and unconscious of being ob-&#xD;
served, she knows not how fair she is ! What&#xD;
splendid teeth ! They look like bracelets of&#xD;
snowy pearls placed in a casket lined with rose-&#xD;
colored velvet-and how musically she laughs&#xD;
and talks ! I have indeed -discovered a prize.&#xD;
It will require all my wit to know how to go to&#xD;
work to secure possession of it ; but she shall&#xD;
be mine, or I will perish in the attempt to make&#xD;
her mine! From the moment I beheld her my&#xD;
heart has not been my own ; she has fascinated&#xD;
me beyond the power of any female to do before,&#xD;
and without being aware of it. But who can&#xD;
that fearful wild being be who munches and&#xD;
scowls about her, and looking as if she were&#xD;
the very Witch oc Endor. Hark ! they talk&#xD;
to her."&#xD;
" You don't know, dear mother, what a hand-&#xD;
some gown I saw in~ York to-day," said the&#xD;
young girl. " When Elliot goes to town again&#xD;
he has promised me he will get it for you. I&#xD;
mean it shall be your birthday gift, for your&#xD;
birthday comes next month."      .&#xD;
" Um ! um ! um !" growled the woman, and&#xD;
answered snappishly, " birthdays are 'death-&#xD;
&#xD;
days !  Don't talk to me of birthdays.  Death!&#xD;
death ! death ! that is what I love to talk&#xD;

'" And I saw a handsome handkerchief, moth-)&#xD;

words and manner ; " and I couldn't resist the&#xD;
temptation to buy it for you. It will do nicelyf&#xD;
to go with the gown, as they've both got red&#xD;
and green in them."  As he spoke he drew&#xD;
from his pocket a handkerchief of just the pat.&#xD;
tern to suitan old dame, who usually fancies ga3'&#xD;
tints; but their mother shook her head in&#xD;
melancholy manner, saying in a hollow voice :&#xD;
" White winding-sheets and white coffin-caps&#xD;
Bring me these-I want nothing but grave&#xD;
clothes,!"&#xD;
"Dear mother, I mean to make up your gown 1.&#xD;

It is so becoming !' echoed Alice, arrang-&#xD;
ing it a little more.&#xD;
The, poor woman .caught the glass out of his&#xD;
hand, and holding it to her face, her features&#xD;
relaxed into a smile, and she said in a tone of&#xD;
satisfaction anl simple pleasure, that rewarded&#xD;
them both for all they did:&#xD;
" It is pretty-it is splendid ! Now, chil-&#xD;
ndren, I can walk queen of the night and of the&#xD;
stars !" and, rising, she strode up and down the&#xD;
room with a majesty that, while it was ludicrous,&#xD;
was truly commanding; for she was barefooted,&#xD;
and her gown old and torn.   " Give me my&#xD;
sceptre !" She. snatched up a broken broom,&#xD;
and extending it in her right hand, she proceed-&#xD;
ed to make a speech as imaginary queen of sonie&#xD;
imaginary realm, when Beachampe, in his inter-&#xD;
est to get a better look at the face of the maiden,&#xD;
who had drawn near the window, knocked down&#xD;
one of the oars. The noise it produced startled&#xD;
all three in the room, but alarmed himself more,&#xD;
lest he should now be discovered. With a&#xD;
bound he left the place, and hastened towards&#xD;
the boat at full speed.&#xD;
"What can it have been ?" asked Alice, look-&#xD;
ing inquiringly into her brother's face.&#xD;
t+   I will see," he answered, catching up the&#xD;
light and going out.  "Tony! Tony !" he call,.&#xD;
'ed-but no Tony responded.&#xD;
" Be? it is the devil !" exclaimed the old&#xD;
* woman, with extraordinary readiness.   " He&#xD;
couldn't find the door in the dark, for do you&#xD;
iknow he is almost as blind as a bat on earth,&#xD;
though in hell he sees with eyes like the sun."&#xD;
Much as Alice heard of her mother's wild&#xD;
rhapsodies and extravagant notions, and little as&#xD;
custom had made her regard them, she turned&#xD;
pale and glanced towards the door, not without&#xD;
apprehension, as her brother went out.&#xD;
"Some one has knocked the oars down I put&#xD;
here as I came in."&#xD;
F" What dat you ses, massa Elliot ?" called&#xD;
out Tony, from his cabin, which was a sort of&#xD;
cook-house, on the further side of the area. -&#xD;
" Did you knock these oars down?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"When wos it dey knock down ?" interro-&#xD;
gated the African adjunct, coming up, in a red&#xD;
&#xD;
woollen' nightcap, and otherwise prepared for&#xD;
turning in.&#xD;
"Just now.   They fell not half a minute&#xD;
ago."&#xD;
"I nebber do it, massa. I wos jes got done&#xD;
sayin' my prayers jes as you call out, and wos&#xD;
gwine to turn in onder my blanket. I nebber&#xD;
done it."&#xD;
" There is not wind enough," said Elliot ;&#xD;
" some person did it."&#xD;
" Dat dey did-jes you look dar !  See dat&#xD;
ar' track ob a shoe. Sombody stan' dare not&#xD;
long 'go-sartain!"&#xD;
" It was the devil, I say," called out the&#xD;
woman from within. " See if you don't find&#xD;
one of his feet cloven like a beast-I know he&#xD;
was there ! - Don't I smell the brimstone he per-&#xD;
fumes himself with when he comes to see me !"&#xD;
"Gor-brangay, massa ! I b'lieve de ole mis-&#xD;
sus half right," almost yelled Tony. " Dare&#xD;
clove foot-reglar hoof, sure ! Phuff!' phuff!&#xD;
I tinks I smellem brimstone, too-!"&#xD;
Elliot examined with the light the tracks a&#xD;
little closer, and saw that they had been made&#xD;
by high heels of a boot-two or three of the-&#xD;
heel marks touching, presented exactly the ap-&#xD;
pearance of a small hoof.&#xD;
"It is no fisherman or person of our parts,&#xD;
whose foot made these," he said, speaking to&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
" Pat it aint, massa-dat it aint !  Do ole&#xD;
missus is right dis time; de debble hab been&#xD;
here an' no mistake ! P'raps he come to steal&#xD;
de middlin's out ob do kitchum !"&#xD;
"That some one has been here is very clear,&#xD;
and somebody who doesn't live on the inlet&#xD;
shore," said Elliot. "They seem to have been&#xD;
looking into the window."&#xD;
" Perhaps," said Alice, "it is some hunter&#xD;
from the distant plantations who has been shoot-&#xD;
ing on the bay, and lost his path home."&#xD;
" Possibly ; but why. did he run when the&#xD;
oars fell, and not rather come in to ask the&#xD;
way ?"&#xD;
Tony, whom a bright thought had struck, had&#xD;
&#xD;
run up to the top of the rampart' to look around&#xD;
him, when he called out that there was some-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DANCI&#xD;
&#xD;
body making off with the bum-boat. Elliot im-&#xD;
mediately ran to the look- ut, and with more in-&#xD;
telligent scrutiny was able to detect a boat&#xD;
pulling away from the land, which he knew was&#xD;
much too small for his craft; but in order to&#xD;
make sure, he called to Tony to follow him, and&#xD;
ran to the water side as fast as he could go.-&#xD;
He there found the bum-boat safely moored'&#xD;
within three yards of the rock, and off on the&#xD;
water he was able to see more clearly than on&#xD;
the rampart, by placing his eyes on a level with&#xD;
the surface, a small two-masted boat receding&#xD;
from the, shore.&#xD;
His first impulse was to pursue-but for&#xD;
what? he asked of himself.  '/ They have done&#xD;
/no mischief. * Doubtless it is some idle person&#xD;
who has sought purposely to alarm us." See.&#xD;
ing then that, whoever he was, he had departed,&#xD;
and finding the bum-boat safe, he returned to-&#xD;
wards the house ; but on his way was called- to&#xD;
by old Brand, who came to the door asking what&#xD;
the running meant, saying that he had heard&#xD;
three persons run by, one after the other. El-'&#xD;
liot told him that one of them was himself and&#xD;
the other must have been Tony ; but who the&#xD;
third one was, who had been the first one, he&#xD;
could not tell-but it was some one who had&#xD;
been lurking about his dwelling.  The old mil-&#xD;
ler's daughter, Margaret, also came out, and&#xD;
after some further conversation upon the proba-&#xD;
ble cause of such a stealthy visit, the two lovers&#xD;
loitered along towards Elliot's house, for they&#xD;
were then, t o years before our story opens,&#xD;
lovers-nay   had   loved  one another from&#xD;
childhood.&#xD;
Beacham e had succeeded in effecting his&#xD;
retreat undiscovered, yet from the voices he&#xD;
heard, and moving lights which he saw, as he&#xD;
pulled away, he was aware he had caused some&#xD;
alarm. -This he regarded as unfortunate-for&#xD;
he had only intended, in this secret visit, to ex-&#xD;
amine the ground, and see what chances there&#xD;
were for his seeing and getting acquainted with&#xD;
the lovely bay lassie who had so captivated his&#xD;
senses. After getting further out-'into the open&#xD;
&#xD;
water, the breeze enabled him to hoist his sails&#xD;
and ship his oars, when he glided swiftly in the I&#xD;
&#xD;
NG STAR.                                  43&#xD;
direction of York. All the way down he was&#xD;
revolving in his mind the course he should take&#xD;
in order to get access to the acquaintanceship of&#xD;
the old fort, without rousing their suspicions, or&#xD;
letting them suspect that he. had any agency in&#xD;
the little affair of disturbance which had taken&#xD;
place during his espionage at the window.&#xD;
At length, after planning and rejecting*half&#xD;
a dozen schemes, he finally clapped his hands&#xD;
together so sharply, and shouted so loud with&#xD;
joy at having discovered a feasible one, that&#xD;
Cato, who was fast asleep in the bottom of the&#xD;
boat, dreaming of hot corn cakes and roasted&#xD;
sweet potatoes, with salt, sprang to his feet as&#xD;
if lie were shot, yelling forth a most strange&#xD;
gibberish of aifright :&#xD;
"Chou-chou chob-gah, yah! Whar-whar&#xD;
-what do massy, massa?-what de massy'?"     1&#xD;
"Silence, you monkey !" cried Beachampe,&#xD;
almost himself frightened by the negro lad's jab-&#xD;
ber.  " You'll have the whole coast up, think-&#xD;
ing a murder is doing here on the water. Keep&#xD;
your eyes open, or I'll prop 'em open with twos&#xD;
pegs.&#xD;
"Yis, mass', I nebber shet em nebber mo&#xD;
more.&#xD;
The boat, pushed rapidly along by the wind,&#xD;
soon came near Beachampe Head, and ran in&#xD;
under the dark, frowning bank of earth and&#xD;
rock, where a couple of tall trees made a prom-&#xD;
inent mark in the day time for vessels coming t, .&#xD;
up and down the bay.    There was a narrow&#xD;
creek on the south side of the bluff, which ran&#xD;
some eight yards inland. Into this Beachampe j~&#xD;
steered, as familiar with the place by night as&#xD;
by day ; and as the wind did not follow him j&#xD;
into the narrow recess of the bay, he brailed up&#xD;
the sails, and the negro lad shoved her along to&#xD;
the end of it with a pole, by pushing on thed~&#xD;
bottom. At the extremity was a flight of rude 4&#xD;
&#xD;
stairs, made of layers of loose stones, for the&#xD;
purpose of ascending the bank.    To an iron&#xD;
staple in the upper stone he fastened the chain&#xD;
of his boat and locked it, while the boy unstep-&#xD;
ped the masts and placed them on his shoulder,&#xD;
with the oars and tiller. At the top of the bank&#xD;
he placed these in a narrow shed or boat-house,&#xD;

rate matters. He soon followed the young man,&#xD;
&#xD;
way to his house.  The approach to Beachampe&#xD;
I-Tall was over an open green, that on the bay&#xD;
side had no other fence than the protecting pitch&#xD;
of the bluff. The mansion handsomely faced&#xD;
this open esplanade, which swept smoothly up&#xD;
to its very portico. On one side were the sta-&#xD;
les placed a little in the rear, and on the other a&#xD;
conservatory, both showing handsome fronts,&#xD;
and. looking like plastered wings to the main'&#xD;
body of the house.  An arched gateway for car-&#xD;
riages led around them on either side.&#xD;
Beachampe did not approach' the front en-&#xD;
trance, but passed round by tlh stables, and&#xD;
gained by the rear his own room, by means of&#xD;
a side door, of which he always carried the key.&#xD;
The house was all quiet, and not a light was&#xD;
anywhere visible.&#xD;
"Dey all gone to bed, mass'," remarked&#xD;
Cato, as they, passed through the hall to his-&#xD;
room.-&#xD;
" Yes. You may go to bed also," said&#xD;
Beachampe.&#xD;
The boy did not wait to be told this a second&#xD;
time, but crawled under the stairs, where lay a&#xD;
blanket and 'a bunch of cotton tied up in an old&#xD;
jacket, as a pillow. Wrapping his head and&#xD;
face round ,and round with the blanket, and lay-&#xD;
ing his ear down upon the old jacket, with his&#xD;
naked feet thrust out at full length, he was in&#xD;
a moment as fast asleep as an owl at noon-day.&#xD;
Beachampe sought his room, and without strik-&#xD;
ing a light, retired, and was soon asleep. Over&#xD;
whose slumbers did the " guardian angels"'&#xD;
watch-the master's or the slave's,-over the&#xD;
sit-planning Nevil, or the ignorant, poor little&#xD;
woolly-headed Cato?&#xD;
The next morning Beachampe, as usual, break-&#xD;
fasted alone in his room-his father taking his&#xD;
meals always in'the breakfast-room, which No-&#xD;
vil of late never entered. After breakfast he&#xD;
went ouk, and took his way towards town. THe&#xD;
etered the Light in the Binuacle, and, making&#xD;
a sign to Blouster, passed into the little parlor,&#xD;
a room in which the host always held conferences&#xD;
with such persons as wished to see him on pri-.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Not money ?    Then it's done !"    /&#xD;
&#xD;
"At least not money just now.&#xD;
&#xD;
an you&#xD;
&#xD;
ter to sit down opposite.&#xD;
"Well, what news this morning, good master&#xD;
Nevil ?" asked Captain Ned, in a tone that he&#xD;
meant should steer at the just medium between&#xD;
familiarity' and respect. .6"You are in town&#xD;
early. "&#xD;
" Blouster, I have an affair on hand, and-&#xD;
want you to aid me a little,'\sail Nevil, at&#xD;
once coming to the point.&#xD;
"You owe me, if I may be so bold as to&#xD;
name it, Mr. Beachampe, something like four&#xD;
hundred dollars now, and all over due, and Ir&#xD;
have no security but your note; and if the old&#xD;
gentleman should not make up with you, and&#xD;
give you the go by, why I shall lose it."&#xD;
" You are as calculating as a 'miser, Ned,"&#xD;
answered Nevil, coloring with angry heat, but&#xD;
for the present feeling that discretion would&#xD;
serve him better than  resentment.  "You&#xD;
needn't fear but that you'll be paid what. you've&#xD;
loaned me."&#xD;
"I don't fear it much ; but .how do matters&#xD;
stand at the HAIll?  Any reconciliation since&#xD;
the fall from your horse ? I told you not to&#xD;
go home that night, but you were as obstinate&#xD;
as Lucifer."     -&#xD;
" Things are just'the same; we never meet."&#xD;
That's bad-bad ! You ought to concili-&#xD;
ate him, 2r he'll cut you off with a shilling."&#xD;
"Not he ! He wont go that fav."&#xD;
"iDon't trust to it."&#xD;
"There's no other heir."&#xD;
'I thought you had a cousin."&#xD;
"Agir1 in England. He never saw her.-&#xD;
But it is' not worth wasting a thoug-t upon. Iff&#xD;
he should will my inheritance away, I would&#xD;
break the will, tand swear that he was out of&#xD;
his mind. I could bribe witnesses enough to&#xD;
swear to this." -&#xD;
S" I advise you to treat him well, and make&#xD;
up You see II am interested-"&#xD;
" To the value of four liundred and odd dol-&#xD;
lars,". added Nevil, sneeringly. " Do not fear&#xD;
-you shall be paid. Now as to this favor I&#xD;
want you to do me, it 'is not money I1 want-"&#xD;
&#xD;
there must be mad Bess."                      t&#xD;
"Then you have been there ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
o tain for me a suit of clothes such as the bay&#xD;
coasters and bum-boat wear ?"&#xD;
"Yes; I have three chests now in my store-&#xD;
room, left here by chaps that have not come&#xD;
after 'em. But what's in the wind ?"&#xD;
"That's just what I want. Let me have a&#xD;
suit complete-hat, shoes, and all."&#xD;
"Yes, I think I can fit you out; if anything&#xD;
is wanting, you can buy it at a slop shop."&#xD;
" Can you get me a place as a hand on one&#xD;
of the bum-boats that run to the inlet after flour&#xD;
and fish, hemp and the like ?"&#xD;
" Next Thursday I send a bum-boat up the&#xD;
toast thirty miles, for flour, fruit and grain."&#xD;
" Do you own one?"&#xD;
" Two that are always going, and a very&#xD;
pretty profit they 'give me. One must turn&#xD;
many ways tliese times to turn a penny."&#xD;
"Can't you send your boat up the inlet for&#xD;
what you want?"         -&#xD;
"I might for the grain and flour, but-"&#xD;
" No buts about it. I want you to let her&#xD;
go to the windmill to load, some five miles up."&#xD;
" I know it-Sledger's mill, you mean. But&#xD;
what freak is this ?'"&#xD;
" I know I can trust you, Blouster. The&#xD;
truth is, I've fallen dead in love with a pretty&#xD;
fisher's girl, and I want to put myself on a foot-&#xD;
ing with her position, to get acquainted with&#xD;
her. I have conceived the idea of playing bum-&#xD;
boat lad for a while and want to run to the&#xD;
windmill."&#xD;
"It must be Sledger's daughter. I have&#xD;
seen her down here with him; a fine, bold, darkI&#xD;
eyed, dashing ereature, with a head like a sea-I&#xD;
hawk, proud and spirited."1&#xD;
" That don't describe my princess, who has&#xD;
eyes as blue as violets, and is mere like a gentle&#xD;
dove than a hawk. Besides, she doesn't live&#xD;
at the mill, but in the old fort, where there is a&#xD;
house constructed of the fallen stones. Do you I&#xD;
know who lives there ?" ,&#xD;
" That is where mad Bess lives--"t&#xD;
" Yes, now you've hit it. The woman I saw&#xD;
&#xD;
der.. " I shall always feel bound to you for&#xD;
his readiness to serve me."&#xD;

" Once only, but was not seen by them; but&#xD;
I saw enough to desire a more intimate acquaint-&#xD;
ance with the fair girl, who is Bess's daughter,&#xD;
for she called the old-woman her mother."&#xD;
"I've seen her ands her brother. I saw them&#xD;
both pass the wharf in their boat to-day, going&#xD;
home. But you had best 'be cautious. You&#xD;
will gain nothing by this mad adventure--give&#xD;
it up."&#xD;
" I am resolved. Who is this Bess, that she&#xD;
has children so unlike her ?"&#xD;
" I don't know-I never saw her but once or&#xD;
twice ; but I have heard the river and bay men&#xD;
talk about her over their cups in the tap-room.&#xD;
She has the reputation of being a witch, and&#xD;
many of my customers believe she can raise a&#xD;
storm, and send ill luck along with a vessel.-&#xD;
They speak of her with fear and respect; but&#xD;
she is only cracked, and imposes on them by&#xD;
the fierce and violent manner she takes upon&#xD;
herself. The ~son is a fine young fellow, and&#xD;
would be a dangerous enemy for you to make&#xD;
in this affair, Nevil."&#xD;
"I don't fear any man. I am as reckless&#xD;
and. courageous as any man you'll name, you'll&#xD;
allow. If I have enemies, I'll meet their knife&#xD;
with a knife, their hate with hate, their strata-&#xD;
gems with stratagems. Consequences I am in-&#xD;
different to. The girl -has maddened me ! I&#xD;
am not myself since I saw her yesterday. Will&#xD;
you give me the suit ?"&#xD;
" Yes."&#xD;
" And give me a birth on your craft?"&#xD;
" Yes; the skipper is a steady double-dutch-&#xD;
man, who never sees anything except it is be-&#xD;
fore his face, and then he has to turn it round&#xD;
to see the other side also."&#xD;
" The very man !"&#xD;
"'You have some knowledge of the water-&#xD;
you can go in place of the foremast man, whom&#xD;
Will manage to keep at the Binnacle for a&#xD;

under hatches were a' plan to catch or marry an&#xD;
heiress, I would help you in it so much the&#xD;
readier ; but this girl isn't worth a shell comb."&#xD;
"I'll rot marry a woman, were she rich as&#xD;
Croesus, if I didn't love her; nor do I say I&#xD;
would marry a woman whom I did love, without&#xD;
a fortune. As for this pretty girl, I have not&#xD;
come to any decision-I shall leave that to&#xD;
events.  But rather than lose her, I would&#xD;
marry her."&#xD;
"You are beside yourself."&#xD;
You don't understand me, Ned. Your head&#xD;
is a little thick in love matters. I would marry&#xD;
as your foremast hand, you know--as Peter,&#xD;
Jock, or John something; and then if I chose&#xD;
afterwards, I need not consider Nevil Beach-&#xD;
ampe, heir of 'the Hall,' as bound by such a&#xD;
marriage ! You see I am not such a fool as you&#xD;
suppose."&#xD;
"When do you want these things ?"&#xD;
" When does your bum-boat sail ?"&#xD;
Thursday forenoon. "&#xD;
"Then I will don them here. I will come&#xD;
and stay with you Wednesday night, and get&#xD;
acquainted with the skipper-what's his name?&#xD;
"Skipper Von Krouteni."&#xD;
"And the name of the boat ?"&#xD;
" The Black Buck."&#xD;
"A rare name, and fanciful."&#xD;
"She's painted black as a coal all over, and&#xD;
has a pair of "buck horns nailed on her stern,&#xD;
and hence the name."&#xD;
"And what shall be my name ?"&#xD;
"I would say the 'young buck,' responded&#xD;
Bluster, laughing, or approaching as near a&#xD;
\laugh as he ever did, which was a hyenaish dis-&#xD;
play of his lower tier of teeth.&#xD;
" You are in humor to-day, Ned. ]I'll take-&#xD;
let me see, ]I'll be called Ralph Rowley. I think&#xD;
that'll do very well; it's easy to say and easy&#xD;
'obe'recollected."&#xD;
"I am in hopes 'that as Ralph Rowley, you&#xD;
&#xD;
This matter being thus arranged, Nevil took&#xD;
his leave and returned home, after remaining an&#xD;
hour or two in the town, where the better class&#xD;
of citizens, as he went along, seemed to look&#xD;
upon him with but slight respect, while broken&#xD;
looking men, with seedy coats and red noses,&#xD;
and dissipated, hard-faced young men, rather'&#xD;
fawned on him and coveted his notice-for he&#xD;
was still the heir of ,Beachampe Hall, though&#xD;
well known to be living under temporary dis-&#xD;
grace with his father.&#xD;
The night of Wednesday arrived, and Beach-&#xD;
ampe found himself once more at the Binnacle.&#xD;
Having changed his dress in Blouster's bed-&#xD;
room for the one he had provided foi- hin, and&#xD;
put a brown curly wig on over his dark hair,&#xD;
and reddened his complexion by a brownish-red&#xD;
tint which Blouster prepared for him, he sur-&#xD;
veyed himself in a glass, much to his satisfac-&#xD;
tion as well as that of his host.&#xD;
"You would never be known, Mr. Beach-&#xD;
ampe," he said, approvingly ; "you might como&#xD;
up to the tap and drink, and I'd never suspect&#xD;
you. You look like quite a beau, too, for your&#xD;
wig is handsome, your cheeks are florid, and&#xD;
your dress is almost now ; and the way you&#xD;
wear your cap gives you a buekish jaunty air&#xD;
that sets you of'."&#xD;
" Yes, I think I will do. Why I am not a&#xD;
bad looking fellow even in this guise-do you&#xD;
think so, Ned ? It will do to captivate a fisher's&#xD;
maid."&#xD;
"I wish it were an heiress, Master Nevil."&#xD;
"So do I, and I fancied her as I do this&#xD;
pretty girl in the old fort.  Now where is. my&#xD;
Captain Krouten.?"&#xD;
" In the tap, smoking and drinking ale.-&#xD;
You go out by this other door and come in by&#xD;
the usual way, and I will let you know him. I&#xD;
have already told him I have got a new man&#xD;
for him."&#xD;
2Beachampe entered the tap-room with a roll-&#xD;
ig gait, admirably imitating- the manners, ,as&#xD;
he had assumed the garb, of the river men, and&#xD;
going up to the bar, slapped down a piece of&#xD;
&#xD;
serve him slowly, and in a sullen way, as if he'&#xD;
didn't like the authoritative tone in which he,&#xD;
had been addressed. He gave him the liquor,&#xD;
and was taking up the money with his eye upon&#xD;
the door, as if he each moment expected Beach-&#xD;
ampe to make his appearance. .The latter, in-&#xD;
stead of resigning the money, said in an under&#xD;
tone, " You'll charge it, Ned,- if you please,&#xD;
boy !'&#xD;
The host started, and then burst into a chuckle,&#xD;
and bringing his hand down on the bar, he&#xD;
ejaculated:&#xD;
Capital ! Took me in cleverly ; you'll do.&#xD;
Krouten, man; come hither."&#xD;
" What do you want ?' bluntly asked the&#xD;
person addressed, a short, pot-bellied fellow,&#xD;
seated at one of the tables, on which stood a&#xD;
mug of ale, of which and his pipe he whiffed&#xD;
and quaffed alternately. He was the very pie-&#xD;
ture of comfort and ease. "What do you want?"&#xD;
he repeated, as if he didn't like to be disturbed.&#xD;
" Here's your foremast man, skipper."&#xD;
"Good ! Let him come here."&#xD;
Beachampe rolled, up to him, hitching at his&#xD;
trowsers and touching his cap to him, " sarvant,&#xD;
skipper 1"&#xD;
"So you are going with me?"&#xD;
Yes, skipper."&#xD;
&#xD;
money and called loudly for a dram. J3louster&#xD;
was evidently deceived, for he proceeded to&#xD;

"That is right. What is your name ?"&#xD;
Ralph."&#xD;
"Good-you will do. Now, do you know&#xD;
any stories?"&#xD;
With this the skipper, who had filled his pipe&#xD;
in anticipation,' leaned  back, shut his eyes,&#xD;
pricked up his ears and prepared to listen.-&#xD;
Beachampe regarded him with surprise, and not&#xD;
being exactly prepared to spin the old fellow a&#xD;
yarn, took the advantage of his eyes being shut&#xD;
to, run to the tap. and ask Bloaster what he&#xD;
meant by asking a story.&#xD;
" Why the skipper is more fond of yarns&#xD;
than he is of beer, I believe. He never will&#xD;
take a man in his craft that can't spin a yarn.&#xD;
He asked me if -you could, and I told him yes.&#xD;
He has a mania for hearing yarns, and bores his&#xD;
hands to death, and when he is in the tap he'll&#xD;
often keep Wivil drinking-and spinning till we&#xD;
dousedfe glim."&#xD;
" If that's his weakness, I'll humor it," an-&#xD;
swered Beachampe, laughing, and getting back&#xD;
to his seat, just as the skipper was beginning to&#xD;
open his eyes to look after his foremast man, he&#xD;
told him the story of Sinbad the Sailor, which&#xD;
our readers need .not should be here given,&#xD;
though the old skipper swore, when it was end-&#xD;

CHAPTER&#xD;
&#xD;
A new comet at the mill.&#xD;
skipper with a story f&#xD;
tion.  Suspicions respect&#xD;
HE evening of the&#xD;
which we left Nevil'&#xD;
skipper in the tap-room, a&#xD;
lugger of large 'size, was s&#xD;
standing under easy sail to,&#xD;
place. The sun was about&#xD;
and Brand Sledger had abo&#xD;
for that day, and was prepare&#xD;
p and go into the house.&#xD;
"jMag," he said to his da&#xD;
the craft that came up hereJ&#xD;

"tI can't say, father; b&#xD;
skipper himself, who was a fa&#xD;
to hear stories."&#xD;
"Yes, it is the same. I&#xD;

horns over her stern.  He is&#xD;

seen by the miller  "Ahoy !" responded the stout miller.&#xD;
wards the landing-  "I want to take in a boat of corn and flour&#xD;
half an hour high, to-morrow morning, and here's the order and&#xD;
ut ground his grist the money 'from Ned Blouster of the Binnacle&#xD;
ing to shut the will tavern."&#xD;
Sledger told him he could h avc forty bags of&#xD;
ughter, " isn't that flour and sixteen of corn, and then invited him&#xD;
last spring toget a to come, ashore and take supper with him.&#xD;
"I never can go in my boat."&#xD;
ut it looks like the  "That's true," Sledger said, with a laugh,&#xD;
Tt man, and so loved as he surveyed the tun-like dimensions of the&#xD;
skipper, and then glanced at the little yawl that&#xD;
know the lugger by would scarcely contain two boys.&#xD;
bow, and the buck's "You come on board and eat with me."&#xD;
after more flour, I  Sledger locked his mill and went down to the&#xD;
forty bags left, as shore, where, taking a boat belonging to himself,&#xD;
ty this morning." be shoved her along-side of tho lugger, which&#xD;
nd nearer, and soon had painted on her stern the words, " The Black&#xD;
is of the shore, the Buck." He leaped lightly to the deck, which&#xD;
At allowing Krouten was not two feet from the water, the whole ves-&#xD;
&#xD;
49&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DANCING STAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
sel not being more than thirty-two feet long, by&#xD;
nine in breadth of beam amidships, sloop rigged.&#xD;
He shook hands in his frank way with the skip-&#xD;
per, and nodded to Beachampe, who was coiling&#xD;
up the jib halyards.&#xD;
The miller advanced and shook hands with&#xD;
the foremast man, and said he should be glad.,to&#xD;
have him come up to the mill and see him and&#xD;
" see the folks," by which he meant his daugh-&#xD;
ter ; for, be it clearly understood, the position of&#xD;
foremast man made Beachampe an equal of&#xD;
those honest and= unsophisticated people. A&#xD;
foremast man of good character, and industrious,&#xD;
Brand Sledger considered a match for his hand-&#xD;
some daughter. Nevil Beachampe, therefore,&#xD;
was in no manner regarded as inferior to those&#xD;
whose acquaintance he came to make, but exactly&#xD;
their equal. He, therefore, entered into easy&#xD;
conversation with the miller, and the miller with&#xD;
him, about news in York, prices of corn, flour,&#xD;
meal, &amp;amp;e., and a few questions were passed and&#xD;
answered upsn the national politics. Nevil&#xD;
played his part well, and did his best to ingra-&#xD;
tiate himself into the favor of Sledger, in which&#xD;
he succeeded 'so well, that the miller insisted&#xD;
that after supper both should go ashore in his&#xD;
boat and spend the evening with him. " And,"&#xD;
added the miller, " I'll have a lass, a neighbor&#xD;
of mine, in, and if you are so good at telling&#xD;
stories, they would like to listen, I'll be bound !"&#xD;
Beachampe's heart bounded. He guessed&#xD;
who the lass was, but he had too much caution&#xD;
to ask the name. He resolved to risk nothing&#xD;
by precipitancy, but wait patiently the develop-&#xD;
ments that might occur. After supper, which&#xD;
the miller ate on board, and of which Nevl par-&#xD;
took as an equal, the larger boat which b brought&#xD;
the miller on board, bore the skipper safely to&#xD;
land ; and th'e three were soon seated in the best&#xD;
room at the stone house. There was no one&#xD;
there when they entered, but in a moment camne&#xD;
ii Margaret, who received her father's guests&#xD;
with that native hospitality of which formal&#xD;
politeness is only the imitator.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Can she, tell good stories ?" asked the&#xD;
skipper.&#xD;
" She can keep you up all night, skipper,&#xD;
&#xD;
talking about ghosts and faies, mermaids and&#xD;
giants, till you'd be afraid to' go to bed," an-&#xD;
swered Sledger.&#xD;
"She shal tell me some to-night. I will sit&#xD;
up all night to hear them."&#xD;
"I fear you'd fall asleep very soon, sir," an-&#xD;
swered Margaret, to whom the skipper seemed&#xD;
to be a sort of amusing curiosity. She had cast&#xD;
more than one side glance at Ralph Rowley, as&#xD;
we must now call him, and thought what a con-&#xD;
trast there was between the skipper and the fore-&#xD;
mast man. - She thought him a handsome, bold&#xD;
looking young man, and shrank suddenly from&#xD;
his fiery glance ; for though Nevil could disguise&#xD;
his form, he co uld not mask his eyes ; these be-&#xD;
trayed the true character of the soul that looked&#xD;
out of them. The unexpected beauty of the&#xD;
miller's daughter struck him with surprise, and&#xD;
he could not help gazing at her; but it was with&#xD;
different emotions from those lie experienced on&#xD;
seeing Alice Beaufort for the first time. He&#xD;
admired her, but rather feared the proud style&#xD;
of her brave beauty. His inferior spirit saw in&#xD;
her eye a spirit higher than his own, before&#xD;
which, did he dare to insult her, his own would&#xD;
quail. While he was regarding her, and won-&#xD;
dering that so noble a looking girl should be&#xD;
only a miller's daughter, the door gently opened,&#xD;
and a soft, pure face looked in and was half&#xD;
withdrawn again at the sight; of the strangers.&#xD;
P-lph's quick ear had caught the opening -door,&#xD;
and his keen eye recognized the lovely features&#xD;
of the fair maid he had adventured on this: ex-&#xD;
pedition to see. The time had now come for&#xD;
him to exercise his utmost skill and precaution.&#xD;
The object he had in view was to endeavor to&#xD;
draw the young girl's heart to his own, to en-&#xD;
twine her affections around him,-in a word, to&#xD;
use every art to make her love him.&#xD;
" Come in, Alice," said Sledger, " don't be&#xD;
frightened. It is only two friends. I was go-&#xD;
ing to send for you."&#xD;
" Don't draw back, dear Alie," said Mar-&#xD;
garet, running to and drawing her mn.&#xD;
" I did not know bat it was some one of the&#xD;
&#xD;
neighbors who could tell where Elliot stays."&#xD;
" He'l be bowling along shortly," said&#xD;

ana could tell well what he had seen; and having&#xD;
a fertile imagination, he could romance by the&#xD;
&#xD;
hour in the most attractive narrative..&#xD;
&#xD;
He soon&#xD;
&#xD;
Sledger; " the wind is light, and he will hardly&#xD;
row if he can come with the wind, which will&#xD;
rise with the moon in about an hour.  Come in&#xD;
and sit down. This is.Skipper Krouten, whom,&#xD;
you remember seeing here before, and this is&#xD;
his foremast man, Master Ralph Rowley, I think&#xD;
he said."&#xD;
Alice gracefully and timidly bowed, and then&#xD;
seated herself close by Margaret. -&#xD;
Here the two old men entered into a conversa-&#xD;
tion upon crops and freights in their way, while&#xD;
Margaret, with her knitting in her hands, took a&#xD;
seat by a little octagon stand which she brought&#xD;
out from he corner, where it stood all day with&#xD;
a big bible upon it, and set it in the centre of&#xD;
the room.  She sat by a candle placed.upon it,&#xD;
and commenced taking up stitches in a pair of&#xD;
enormous blue hose 'that she was knitting for&#xD;
her father.  But at every  stitch she would&#xD;
glance slyly at Alice and then cut the corner of&#xD;
her eye ,round at the place where Ralph sat&#xD;
quietly watching, stealthily, the charming face&#xD;
of the latter, as she bent over to see what Mar-'&#xD;
garet was doing, as-if she had never seen stitch-&#xD;
es taken up before.  But . that is the fashion&#xD;
young girls usually comport themselves in the,&#xD;
presence of 'a strange young man, especially if&#xD;
he is at all good looking, and has an air about&#xD;
him as if he might prove a very agreeable fel-&#xD;
low if they only knew him better.-&#xD;
Finding that they were a long time engaged.&#xD;
in reckoning the stitches, and whispering and t l-&#xD;
egraphing together, Ralph drew his chair up&#xD;
nigher, and said, dryly :&#xD;
"When are we to have those stories ?"&#xD;
This was spoken so oddly and with such a&#xD;
dry manner, that both girls, looking him in&#xD;
the face, burst into a laugh-or rather Mag&#xD;
laughed, but Alice only smiled. He smiled&#xD;
back, and thus the ice being broken, they had i&#xD;
quite a merry conversation. Ralph amused&#xD;
them with numerous queer anecdotes about the&#xD;
old skipper, oft course made up on the spot.&#xD;
He also had a ready wit, and was a good mimic,&#xD;
&#xD;
Sledger, and wheeling square round, filled up&#xD;
his pipe hard crammed, and bending his ears,&#xD;
was lost in listening.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DANCING STAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
had them both deep and thrilled listeners to an&#xD;
account of his escape from an old castle on the&#xD;
coast of Spain, where he had been carried by&#xD;
Algerine buccaneers. His story was full of&#xD;
love, adventure, narrow escapes, and striking&#xD;
scenes. Those two girls, who had never listen-&#xD;
ed to anything of the kind before, and to whom'&#xD;
it opened a new world of ideas, were fascinated,&#xD;
especially the fair Alice, whose face underwent&#xD;
changes as rapidly as the changes of the story.&#xD;
Now it expressed horror, now surprise, now pale&#xD;
fear, now eager expectation, now deep symp&#xD;
thy, now, joy and triumph. He saw that he&#xD;
could play upon her sensitive nature as upon&#xD;
a harp with silver chords. Margaret listened&#xD;
with less emotion, and seemed to be most pleased'&#xD;
with the parts where danger and battle stalked,&#xD;
and courage and energy were called into action.&#xD;
But Alice was not moved by those.; they rather&#xD;
shocked her ; but when he spoke of a youthful&#xD;
maiden, the superb daughter of the buccaneer,&#xD;
who fell in love with him, and at the risk of her&#xD;
life, aided his escape, but who was shot by her.&#xD;
father as she was flying to embark with her lover,&#xD;
having onlygone back for a casket of jewels,&#xD;
the eyes of the credulous Alice glittered with&#xD;
tears, and she heaved a deep sigh to the memory&#xD;
of the fanciful creation of the young foremast-&#xD;
man's brain.  And when, in his tale of romantic&#xD;
love and adventure, he spoke of his own dan-&#xD;
gers and death-escapes, she sat and fixed her&#xD;
eyes upon him as if her heart were in them;&#xD;
and when he ended his story, she looked happy&#xD;
to think that he who had gone through such-&#xD;
peril, by sea and land, by fire and sword, by&#xD;
love and hate, in prison and on deck, was alive&#xD;
to tell it. Ralph discovered the impression' he&#xD;
had made upon hei-, and he immediately con-.&#xD;
gratulated himself.   ..&#xD;
There was a third listener to his story, who&#xD;
was, in his way, quite as much interested in the&#xD;
narrative as either of the maidens. This was the&#xD;
skipper. His quick ear hai no sooner caught&#xD;
the pace of a story going forward, than he&#xD;
abruptly put an end to his conversation with&#xD;
&#xD;
I fear it will be more difficult to escape, if I&#xD;
would, than from an Algerine prison."&#xD;
They had stopped to look at, the gorth star,&#xD;
&#xD;
The evening being pretty well spent, Alice&#xD;
said she must go, and Krouten said he must go,.&#xD;
also. The miller said he would go down and&#xD;
see him safely on board the lugger, and in the&#xD;
morning they would go to work betimes to load&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"Good night," said Alice lo all, and was go-&#xD;
ing out to run over to the fort alone, as she had&#xD;
done a hundred times, ' when Ralph was at her&#xD;
side.&#xD;
"Will you let me go with you?" he said, in&#xD;
a gentle tone, just suited to her gentle ear, al-&#xD;
ready ringing to the mellow notes, of his fine&#xD;
voice, which in those parts of his tale that spoke&#xD;
of love, he modulated with the most persuasive&#xD;
skill.&#xD;
" It is not far-I can go alone," she answer-&#xD;
ed, while in her heart she was sweetly pleased&#xD;
at having him by her side.&#xD;
He, however, walked by her side ; and in or:&#xD;
der to detain her, that he might longer enjoy&#xD;
her society, hinted to the north star, and&#xD;
said with emot'':&#xD;
"How often, fair Alice, have I gazed on yon-&#xD;
der star from the barred windows of my prison.&#xD;
in that' old castle in Spain, and sighed to think&#xD;
that even-the birds could fly whither they would,&#xD;
while I was bound in adamantine chains."&#xD;
Alice looked at the star with deeper interest&#xD;
than she had ever gazed at it before. She lin-&#xD;
gered because he lingered.&#xD;
"Ah, if you had known, dear Alice, that I&#xD;
was there, thus a pensive captive, I know you&#xD;
would have felt for me ! I know you would&#xD;
have thought about me, and wished, in the&#xD;
kindness of your heart, you could release me."&#xD;
"Indeed I should," answered Alice, with&#xD;
sincerity. " I rejoice now in yod~r being free."&#xD;
" I know you. do. But, Alice, I fear I have&#xD;
.escaped one bondage to be bound in another."&#xD;
"In what way ?" she asked, with surprise.&#xD;
," In the chains of love. Yes, dear Alice, I&#xD;
am your prisoner ! I am your captive ! You&#xD;
have to-night taken my heart and bound it ; and&#xD;
&#xD;
all day getting here. Don't be alarmed. He&#xD;
will be here in good time. You and the miller's&#xD;

&#xD;
and she was still standing midway between the&#xD;
mill and the fort. He. had gently drawn her&#xD;
arm within his, and sought to ~fold her warm&#xD;
hand within the clasp of his own. But at these&#xD;
words she quietly drew her hand from him, and&#xD;
said:&#xD;
" You must not talk so, Mr. Rowley ; you&#xD;
but laugh at me." And she moved on quickly.&#xD;
" I do not, indeed I do not, lovely Alice. I&#xD;
am sincere. I love you. I can love no one&#xD;
but you. Do not be displeased,"&#xD;
"I am not displeased. Here is my mother's&#xD;
door. Good night, sir !"&#xD;
" Alice," he said, detaining her by the hand&#xD;
as she was about to enter, " Alice, dear Alice !"&#xD;
'I will listen," she calmly answered, yet&#xD;
trembling with a strange and undefinable min-&#xD;
gling of hope, fear and love.&#xD;
"Do not be my 'enemy for loving you."&#xD;
"Indeed I am not-but-"&#xD;
" May I hope? I shall leave here to-mor-&#xD;
row. It depends on you whether I ever return.&#xD;
Nay, do not go in. I may not have another&#xD;
moment like this. Say that I may hope."&#xD;
"Hope for what?"&#xD;
" That you will look kindly on me ! Hope&#xD;
that I may be your friend. Hope that you will&#xD;
show me confidence. How that you will love."&#xD;
"Yes, you .may hope ; but remember, I&#xD;
promise nothing," she answered, playfully. "It&#xD;
is no more than hope."&#xD;
It is all I ask,'" he answered, thrilling with&#xD;
inward joy. "II may then return to see you&#xD;
after to-morrow."&#xD;
"Will your duty call you ?-not without."&#xD;
"I shall make it my duty. Yes, I will have&#xD;
business here."&#xD;
" To-morrow you will see my brother, El-&#xD;
liot. I know you will like him."&#xD;
" If he is at all like you, A~lice, I shall love&#xD;
him as a brother," he answered, warmly. I&#xD;
" I am afraid something has happened. He&#xD;
has not yet come home.&#xD;
" There is no wind. If he left York since&#xD;
noon, he has been becalmed since. We were&#xD;

" What have you so long been watching the&#xD;
bay for ?" asked Margaret, who came to the foot&#xD;
of the rampart on which Alice stood.&#xD;
&#xD;
daughter seem to be great friends. She is very&#xD;
handsome, but I thought not of her in your&#xD;
presence. You remind me, Alice, of that beau-&#xD;
tiful Moorish maiden who aided my escape.''&#xD;
"But you said she had black hair and black&#xD;
eyes ; mine are blue, and my hair is brown. 0,&#xD;
you are pleased to say what you think will&#xD;
please me !"&#xD;
" I don't mean in complexion, but in air,&#xD;
person, voice and beauty.  Ah, Alice, you&#xD;
know not know fair you areJ"&#xD;
" Come in ! What do you chat, chat, chat,&#xD;
on the door step for. Come in, and let the&#xD;
devil have a chance to get in through the key&#xD;
hole !"&#xD;
" It is my mother. I must go in," she said.&#xD;
" One kiss, Alice !"&#xD;
And before she could withdraw herself from&#xD;
the arm that clasped her waist, his lip had touch-&#xD;
ed her cheek.  She sprung back and entered&#xD;
the house, and he walked away towards the&#xD;
lugger, cherishing in his heart hopes that had&#xD;
for their' aim tlhe destruction of the guileless&#xD;
girl whose heart he had ha f won, by deceiving&#xD;
her as to his true rank ; for had he approached&#xD;
her as Nevil Beachampe, t e young roue, she&#xD;
would have shrunk from him as the dove from&#xD;
the hawk ; but as her equal, the equal of her&#xD;
brother, as "one of themselves," she was pre-&#xD;
vented by no fears or suspicions from loving him,&#xD;
if she were pleased with him. Maidens of the'&#xD;
humbler class are much ,more easily approached&#xD;
by youths of their own position in society, than&#xD;
by those who are far above them; and it was the&#xD;
knowledge of this fact which suggested to Nevil&#xD;
Beachampe the disguise which he had now&#xD;
assumed.&#xD;
The next day Ralph had an opportunity of|&#xD;
again speaking with Alice, during which he took&#xD;
care to deepen the impression he had made upon&#xD;
her heart. When, at length, in the afternoon&#xD;
he embarked and sailed away in~ the lugger ,she&#xD;
looked after it long and earnestly, and did not&#xD;
cease to watch it until it disappeared behind a&#xD;
promontory a league to the south.&#xD;
&#xD;
skipper, Krouten, and I think it is all the ree-&#xD;
omendation he has, .and that he is just fit to be&#xD;
the story loving skipper's foremastman, and tell&#xD;
him stories over a jug of gin ; for I did not tell&#xD;

&#xD;
THE DANCING STAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
She blushed and inade no reply ; but the ob-&#xD;
serving eye and good understanding of herfriend,&#xD;
with what she had already discovered, enabled&#xD;
her to guess at the truth.&#xD;
"You are looking after this fne sailor, Ralph,"&#xD;
she added, laughingly  "0, Alice, you must&#xD;
not think of him again. He never '1l do for&#xD;
you There is something ii the expression of&#xD;
his eyes that I do not fancy.  Be assured, smilo&#xD;
and be as areeable as he pleases, he has a bad.&#xD;
heart."&#xD;
"0, Margaret, how can you say so! He&#xD;
seems all goodness and honor. I never -knew&#xD;
any one equal to him. le is so superior to&#xD;
any young man we know.   Ah, Mag, I believe&#xD;
you are a little bit jealous 1"&#xD;
"Not a whit. Dear me! 'I jealous, with&#xD;
such a noble lover as Elliot ? See him there&#xD;
standing on the rock directing the landing of&#xD;
the cargo he brought so late last night.' What,&#xD;
a free, manly-air, as if he never had a thought&#xD;
he would not be willing men and angels should&#xD;
know. He looks the superior of your dashing&#xD;
foremastman, iho don't appear to be sincere. I&#xD;
am glad he is gone. Elliot does not like him&#xD;
ei her. He wonders he ever saw him before.&#xD;
He says that when he first saw him this morn-&#xD;
ing and was introduced to him by father, that&#xD;
he spoke embarrassed and seemed as if he&#xD;
would rather not have met him. This don't&#xD;
look Alike being your friend, Alice, if he is&#xD;
afraid of your brother."&#xD;
" This is only Elliot's notion.  Ho was no&#xD;
doubt afraid he might find in Ralph a rival in&#xD;
your love."&#xD;
"Ha, ha, ha !" laughed Mag, with right&#xD;
hearty mirth. " This is an idea! He knows&#xD;
me better than that. .But I wont say any inore,&#xD;
as I-see you have taken a liking to him ; but for&#xD;
my part I never want to see him again !"&#xD;
" You forget what romantic tales he can tell,&#xD;
and how wel4."&#xD;
" This might recommend him to the good&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DANCING STAR.&#xD;
you that Elliot said he found him drinking gin he had inquire&#xD;
on board when he went into the lugger."      bay men he kn&#xD;
"'Well a-day, I find I shall have to give up of by any of ti&#xD;
thinking about him," answered Alice, with a had been nobo&#xD;
sigh and a smile ; though in her heart she was vised her to ha&#xD;
very well resolved that the more Mag talked he ever return.&#xD;
against him, the more she would like him. This her liking for I&#xD;
is human nature in young girls. It is no way, ly think Alice&#xD;
in order to draw a maiden's affection from a and he felt it h&#xD;
young man whom she really likes, to begin by of the attachm&#xD;
speaking against him.  She will at once take up  Men easily&#xD;

are to entrust her. When he-asks for her, then&#xD;
it will be time enough to ask him to give us ref&#xD;
erences to persons who have known him all his&#xD;
life.'&#xD;
Such a conversation as this had been over-&#xD;
heard by Ralph, accidentally, only a few days&#xD;
before the last departure of the lugger, and it&#xD;
brought him to a determined course of action.&#xD;
This we shall be able to reveal to the reader by&#xD;
following him in carrying it out.&#xD;
It was dark when he reached the wharf and&#xD;
ended from the lugger on the night of the after-&#xD;
noon on which Alice had watched his departure&#xD;
from the shore.&#xD;
",Well, master foremastman, what news&#xD;
now?" ahed Blouster, when they were once,&#xD;
more together in the room in the rear of the tap.&#xD;
Before them was a bottle of old brand brandy&#xD;
and two glasses .&#xD;
"I have laid all my plans.    Success is&#xD;
\ ertamn."&#xD;
"Then you mean to marry her ?"-&#xD;
"i on't be inquisitive, Ned. The girl is in&#xD;
love with me, and will follow me to the world's&#xD;
end."&#xD;
"1 wishshe had a million to take with her,&#xD;
for your sake and mine. There is five hundred&#xD;
and o you are-"&#xD;
"Nomore, Ned, I pray thee, no more. I&#xD;
Snow every dollar I owe thee as well as thou&#xD;
dost. In good time thou shalt be paid.  Have&#xD;
I not served thee as foremastman these three&#xD;
months without pay'?  Out upon thy avarice,&#xD;
man. You owe me wages. But let that pass.&#xD;
The girl is mine. I waite lugger once more.'&#xD;
" You can't have it. sdger sends me word&#xD;
that all the corn is ground p. She has nothing&#xD;
" I must have her."&#xD;
Evil' eyes flashed with disappointed hopes.&#xD;
But he instantly refieeted that anger would do no&#xD;
good vyith such a determined man as Blouster.&#xD;
He, therefore, restrained his feelings,. and said,&#xD;
&#xD;
it to you."&#xD;
Will you leave it with me, and I will to-&#xD;
morrow take it to a jeweller's?"&#xD;
"S o, Ned, pardon me ! I wont trust you,&#xD;

swered Blouster, who was too anxious to ascer- complete this retrospe&#xD;

in order to obtain out of it his own dues, to be about two years prior&#xD;
displeased at the answer of the young man. He our story, and then ta&#xD;
then rose and went out into the tap, which he cabin of the Dancing&#xD;
had left under the charge of one of his " regu- captain trying to covet&#xD;

&#xD;
When they had drunk, Nevil, after a mo-&#xD;
ment's thoughtful silence, said, in a low, decided&#xD;
manner, as if be had made up his mind :&#xD;
"Ned, one offer I have to propose. If you&#xD;
will give me the control of the lugger for a week,&#xD;
that will be long enough, I will pay you every&#xD;
dollar I owe you."&#xD;
" Easily said, Mr. Beachampe," answered&#xD;
Ned, with a tone of ineiedulity.&#xD;
"And easily done. Look here !" and he&#xD;
displayed before hiseyes a diamond brooch, the&#xD;
light from which flashed on the eyes of the host&#xD;
like drops of sunshine.&#xD;
"What is that ?-is it diamonds ?"&#xD;
"Yes-and it is worth eight hundred dollars."&#xD;
"That may be ; but I am no judge of such&#xD;
baubles. What are you going to do with it?"&#xD;
"Place it in your bands, and you are to ad-&#xD;
vance me the remaining three handed : and-&#xD;
when I redeem it _I will pay you the whole." py3&#xD;
"I must first be sure-of its value."&#xD;
"Is there a jeweller here you would trust?",&#xD;
Yes. Let me take it to him, and if he&#xD;
sets that value on it, which I greatly doubt, I&#xD;
will advance you one hundred and fifty over ;&#xD;
keeping the balance for risks and loss of interest,&#xD;
for it might be ten years before you'd redeem it,&#xD;
and ten years' interest must be secured first, as&#xD;
diamonds brew no interest."&#xD;
" By St. Peter and St. Paul, Ned Blouster,&#xD;
you ought to have been a Jew broker," he an&#xD;
swered, .sneeringly.&#xD;
sI dare say I could get rich that way if I&#xD;

&#xD;
\Aayou were Nevil Beachampe-that heuad&#xD;
k cog-red you on board the lugger under your&#xD;
f   .&#xD;
well, and did he make you believe it ?"&#xD;
sked Nevil, scornfully.&#xD;
i  L didn't know what -to believe. I could&#xD;
t consent to confess that you were un*6rtby&#xD;
my rgard--I was reluctant to acknowledge&#xD;
4at I htd been deceived."&#xD;
}   "Aid, Alice, suppose it were true?  Sup-&#xD;
that instead of being a bumble foremast&#xD;
p 1man, I were the noble gentleman they declared&#xD;
e to be ."&#xD;
They did not call you noble, but a base&#xD;
'j, dete an."&#xD;
Tut I a gentleman is a gentleman, Alice.&#xD;
onld you love me any less?"&#xD;
"I could never love one who deceived me."&#xD;
, "But suppose I had assumed this disguise in&#xD;
order, underit, to win your love,-would you&#xD;
 endespise me?"&#xD;
y   "There were no need of it."       e&#xD;
p   " You would not have given me your coni-&#xD;
4. nc had I come in my true character, suppos-&#xD;
i      I had been a gentleman."&#xD;
" But I should have ceased to have confidence&#xD;
Syou as soon as I discovered thai deception&#xD;
ad been practised."&#xD;
h " Ah, Alice ! would you rather I should now&#xD;
rove to be only the foremast man Ralph, than&#xD;
this rich Nevil Beachampe ?"&#xD;
"Yes; for if thou wert Nevil Beachampe,&#xD;
rich thou wouldst not be ; and wert thou he and&#xD;
rich, thou wert too high to be the companion of&#xD;
F thought of Alice Beaufort."&#xD;
and that there was an expression in her eyes as&#xD;
a sihe fixed them hard upon hiis face, that showed&#xD;
1txlin she was beginning to doubt him. She&#xD;
looked pale and anxious, and said, wihout ask-&#xD;
Shim to follow:&#xD;
S" I must go down into the house."&#xD;
"iDo not leave me, Alice !" he cried, de.&#xD;
7sending the tower after her. Upon reaching the&#xD;
&#xD;
,rea below, he caught her by the hand and de-&#xD;
f  trained' her; for he saw she was possessed with&#xD;
s sudden fear of him, for in his eagerness he had&#xD;
&#xD;
almost forgotten the character of Ralph in the&#xD;
haughtier one of Nevil.&#xD;
"Stay, dear Alice. Walk with me a few&#xD;
steps to Sledger's house, and I will tell thee and&#xD;
him there that which will give thee full confi-&#xD;
dence in me !"&#xD;
She yielded from native kindness of heart,&#xD;
yet with mistrust, for he did not seem to her like&#xD;
the same Ralph she had before known ; and he&#xD;
drew her arm in his and said, as he moved to-&#xD;
wards Sledger's:&#xD;
"Why would you hate me '? why lose confi-&#xD;
dence in me, dear Alice, should I confess to&#xD;
you that I am no foremast man, but ra gentle.&#xD;
than, who, from love to you-"'&#xD;
to Tell me the truth, sir !" she cried, with a&#xD;
sudden impetuosity that startled him, while she&#xD;
stopped full in the path they were walking;&#xD;
"Tell me, art thou not Nevil Beachampe ?"&#xD;
"Ask th brother.    There is his boat at the&#xD;
landing ?"&#xD;
"His bo ?--has he come ?"&#xD;
" Yes. Do you not see ?"&#xD;
" I am so happy; I feared he would be caught&#xD;
in the storm that is brewing."&#xD;
" Let us go to him.   Ask him if I am a&#xD;
deceiver."'&#xD;
"Does he know-?   Did he not say that. you&#xD;
were ?"&#xD;
" No matter what he said the other day ; ask&#xD;
him now. Let us go and meet him !"&#xD;
Wholly unsuspecting anything like the act he&#xD;
was contemplating, and faintly seeing the lig-&#xD;
ger, which she readily believed, her brother's&#xD;
returned boat, she accompanied him to the land-&#xD;
ing. She stood on the flat rock against which&#xD;
the stern of the lugger was held, and began to&#xD;
call to Elliot by name, and supposing Cato to&#xD;
be him, she approached close to the slave, when&#xD;
a vivid flash of lightning revealed the negro and&#xD;
the lugger, and showed the absence of the&#xD;
bum-boat.&#xD;
" It is not Elliot's boat I" she exclaimed.&#xD;
" Never mind-it is mine !" be answered,&#xD;
&#xD;
taking her up and springing on board with her.&#xD;
"Push off Ind run her out, Cato 1" he called&#xD;
to his slave, who obeyed ; and before Alice&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
,could realize this act of sudden violence, or use&#xD;
her voice or strength to resist, the lugger was&#xD;
blown by a strong'wind, which came from the&#xD;
north, rapidly from the shore. But he had no&#xD;
sooner set her feet upon the deck, than disen.&#xD;
gaging herself from his arms, as hey was endeav-&#xD;
oring to throw her shawl across her mouth, she&#xD;
uttered a shriek so loud and piercing, that Ca'o,&#xD;
affrighted, dropped the tiller, and the lugger&#xD;
would have broached to, if Nevil had not caught&#xD;
the helm with one hand, while he held the strug-&#xD;
gling and shrieking Alice in the grasp of the&#xD;
other. Cato at length retook it; but not before,&#xD;
with shriek on shriek, the terrified girl had&#xD;
roused the inmates of the miller's house, who&#xD;
were seen running out with lights. Sledger&#xD;
shouted to know what was the matter, while&#xD;
Margaret's screams were heard, id which were&#xD;
mingled the words, "It is Alice-it is Alice&#xD;
drowning !" A light also appeared in the fort,&#xD;
and the tall figure of Mad. Bess was seen stand-&#xD;
ing upon the rampart, while her shrill voice took&#xD;
up the cry. But it had already been silenced&#xD;
on board the lhgger. Nevil had no sooner got&#xD;
the vessel under steerage way again, hand threat-&#xD;
ened Cato with immediate death if he left his&#xD;
post, than he succeeded in muffling the head of&#xD;
his helpless captive, so that her voice was choked&#xD;
to moans. He then bore her below to the&#xD;
wretched little steerage or cabin, and locking&#xD;
the hatch upon her,left her there upon the floor,&#xD;
while he returned to the deck to look after the&#xD;
safety and flight of his vessel. He was now a&#xD;
quarter of a mile from.the shore, on which hei&#xD;
could still see lights moving about in great haste&#xD;
hither and thither, and from which came voices&#xD;
to his ear. But he only smiled grimly and tri&#xD;
umphantly ; for the breeze was strong, and mo&#xD;
mentarily increasing his distance from the land,&#xD;
and he felt conscious that rescue could not robr&#xD;
him of his fair prize. Taking the helm himself,.&#xD;
and making Cato tend the main sheet,. while&#xD;
Jack,-who could always tell without hearing s&#xD;
&#xD;
orders, how to busy himself,by seeing the&#xD;
course that was steered and knowing the direc s&#xD;
tion from which the wind blew,-looked after i&#xD;
the square foresail and jib.               d&#xD;
&#xD;
The appearance of the heavens did not by&#xD;
any means please our navigator' The occasional&#xD;
flashes of lightning revealed dense nd lowering&#xD;
a masses of storm clouds driving along not three&#xD;
quarters of a mile above the earth. The tAJun.&#xD;
der continuously rolled overhead, and the light-&#xD;
ning became more and more frequent and blind.&#xD;
ing. - At length, when he had reached the mid-&#xD;
die of the inlet or bay, the wind begin to lull,&#xD;
and blow fitfully, and he found it difficult te )&#xD;
keep his vessel under steerage way, and every&#xD;
minute or two the heavy sloop-boom would swing&#xD;
with tremendous force over from starboard to&#xD;
larboard, and back again. Yet he continued te&#xD;
run on, hauling his wind and steering out into-x&#xD;
the Chesapeake, though half tempted to make e&#xD;
harbor at Beachampe Head, when he discovered,&#xD;
by a glare of lightning, a vessel directly ahead&#xD;
of him,-steerigg up the inlet. He at once bore&#xD;
up to let her pass 'to leeward, especially as he&#xD;
heard the moans of Alice become more and more&#xD;
audible, as if she were getting her face free from&#xD;
the muffler he had put over it, and he knew that&#xD;
a shriek heard in the vessel would be fatal to&#xD;
him. " Cato," he said, " go down .into the&#xD;
cabin, and tell me'if she is likely to get the shawl&#xD;
off her face ; if she is, hold it till I call you ;- I&#xD;
can't leave the helm now."  Another flash of&#xD;
lightning showed him the vessel nearer and more&#xD;
distinctly, and with a deep oath, he ecimed:&#xD;
"It is the revenue cruiser ! I must up helm,&#xD;
and run for it. A mere fisherman I would not&#xD;
so much care for. Cato, on your life, let het}&#xD;
not lift her voice I"&#xD;
The revenue schooner came gliding on through&#xD;
the nightigloom, the lightning from time to time:,&#xD;
revealing her tall, pencil-like masts, and, broad&#xD;
fields of snowy canvass, with her black and white.&#xD;
tier of ports. She passed the lugger within three&#xD;
hundred fathoms, taking no notice of her, though&#xD;
evidently seeing her. Beachampe's heart was.&#xD;
n his mouth as she came abeam, but when he&#xD;
aw her sail on and pass him and fall astern, he&#xD;
)reathed again ; and hearing a struggde in the&#xD;
&#xD;
teerage, he called Cato to take the helm. But&#xD;
instead of the slave, Alice appeared, her hair&#xD;
dishevelled, hier eyes wildly wandering, her face.&#xD;

THE DANCING STAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
seeing her raise her head, and struggle to artic-&#xD;
ulate, had pressed his, knee upon her, she threw&#xD;
him backward, and springing to her feet, cried,&#xD;
"It is false! it-is false! Save me-save me-&#xD;
0, save me !"&#xD;
The lightning revealed her fah- form, with&#xD;
outstretched hands, to the eyes of those on the&#xD;
deck of the cutter.&#xD;
Two more men !    Cast off-give way !"&#xD;
[      were the rapid orders given in a loud and excit-&#xD;
ed tone by the commander, as seizing a cutlass,&#xD;
and followed by two more men, besiles the three&#xD;
already in the boat, he leaped into it and sped&#xD;
away from the side of the schooner like an ar-&#xD;
row. The distance between the two vessels was&#xD;
not fifty yards. {'Beachampe hardly had time to&#xD;
decide what he should do for his own preserva-&#xD;
tion, when a sudden thought struck his wicked&#xD;
mind, and catching up Alice he cast her over&#xD;
the stern bodily into the sea, hoping by this&#xD;
means to gain time while they should be engaged&#xD;
n rescuing her, to effect his escape. He did&#xD;
not miscalculate the value of this act to him.-&#xD;
They saw the hellish dked, and being almost un-&#xD;
der the stern, the commander leaped from his&#xD;
boat into the water, and rose to the surface with&#xD;
her.  He was soon taken into the boat yby his -&#xD;
men, with his fair prize,' which he was not a&#xD;
little amazed to see was a beautiful young girl&#xD;
She had consciousness enough to realize that she&#xD;
was saved, and no longer in the power of Nevil&#xD;
Beachampe, and to whisper faintly her-gratitude&#xD;
when she became insensible. This was, there-&#xD;
fore, no time to think of pursuing the lugger,&#xD;
and the commander gave orders to pull directly&#xD;
to the cruiser, which was lying to.&#xD;
"Once on board, we'll make sail after this&#xD;
murderer in the lugger, whoever he is," he said.&#xD;
"Give way, men! Don't you see he's escaping&#xD;
to leeward. It is a strange affair ! Who can&#xD;
she be ? What has this crime been committed&#xD;
for ? Pull hard and strong, men ! Here we&#xD;
are alongside-fill away !" he shouted, as he&#xD;
touched the gangway ladder. Stand after the&#xD;
&#xD;
lugger-crowd on all canvass. She contains a&#xD;
murderer !"&#xD;
The young officer then bore the insensibl9&#xD;
&#xD;
Alice to the cabin, and bringing out the medi-&#xD;
cine chest, applied restoratives to bring her to&#xD;
herself. While thus engaged, and wondering at'&#xD;
her marble like loveliness, and amazed at what&#xD;
had transpired, he heard a commotion on deck,&#xD;
and at the same instant the vessel reeled and&#xD;
lay over fearfully low, and the noise of the wind&#xD;
whistling through the rigging told him that the&#xD;
storm had burst upon them. The safety of his&#xD;
vessel was paramount to all other considerations,&#xD;
and leaving a little mulatto cabin boy to hold&#xD;
salts to her nostrils till his return, he hastened&#xD;
on deck.&#xD;
Until all was made safe on board the cruiser,&#xD;
no man had a thought of the lugger, which being&#xD;
looked for, was now no longer visible.&#xD;
"She's swamped, without question," said the&#xD;
lieutenant, " but it's a pity the assassin who&#xD;
threw this lovely girl into the water 'has not&#xD;
lived to have his neck stretched."&#xD;
When the commander returned to the cabin,&#xD;
he was delighted to find Alice sitting up, and&#xD;
though dripping like .a mermaid, smiling and&#xD;
beaming gratitude upon him. And well might&#xD;
she smile. ' She fully realized her escape, and&#xD;
though still trembling and half doubting, she&#xD;
said, extending her hand :&#xD;
"0, sir, Heaven will reward you. Is there&#xD;
no more danger from him ?"&#xD;
"None ! He is at the bottom of the sea,&#xD;
which is a pity, for drowning is too good for&#xD;
him. Pray who is he ?  What did he cast you&#xD;
from the lugger into the sea for ?"&#xD;
" Doubtless that. he might escape while you&#xD;
were rescuing me-I know not else. He is a&#xD;
very, very bad man. He took me by force from&#xD;
my home to-night, and but for your appearance,&#xD;
and that you heard my shrieks, I should have&#xD;
now been in his power. 0, sir, my brother will&#xD;
be so grateful to you also'"&#xD;
" Who is your brother ?"&#xD;
" Elliot Beaufort."&#xD;
" I know him-I know him ! Is it possible&#xD;
you are Alice, of whom I have heard ?" he&#xD;
said, with surprise ; and as he gazed upon her&#xD;
&#xD;
sweet face, fast recovering its natural tints, his&#xD;
heart insensibly ceased longer to be his own.&#xD;

and beinr; detected, only escaped arrest by a&#xD;
midnight flight  In disguise he sought his old&#xD;
home, and under the garb of a knife-grinder he&#xD;
made himself known to his old friend, Captain&#xD;
Ned Blouster. This worthy gladly hailed his&#xD;
return, and after some hours' conversation, du.&#xD;
ing which every matter interestiig to Nevil was&#xD;
talked over ; the trner seeing that his fortunes&#xD;
were desperate, and th it he would not hesitate&#xD;
at anything, proposed to him to engage with&#xD;
him in smnugglirig-a pursuit to which rely se.-&#xD;
cretly and cautiousy our host had been for some&#xD;
year or, two turn ing his versatile talents. It&#xD;
will he supposed that Blouster didi not miscal-.&#xD;
culite his nyan's desperation of condition.&#xD;
Without hesitation Beachaimpe said he would&#xD;
place himself in his hands arid do whatever he&#xD;
directed ; "aiiything shor t o'f murder, Na d !"&#xD;
heree nel4 b no iiurder if the affairs are&#xD;
&#xD;
manage. idiscreetly. You see that I have been&#xD;
smuggling, only on a small scale. I have had1&#xD;
&#xD;
as my accomplices, Skipwith, the Cape pilot,&#xD;
and the fisherman, Tarbox. These had their&#xD;
partners on board certain inward bound vessels;&#xD;
and one would board them to pilot them in, and&#xD;
have his parcels conveyed to his boat ; the other&#xD;
would board them to sell fish, and receive his&#xD;
packages in the same way; but this business,&#xD;
though profitable as far as it goes, is not large&#xD;
enough for the trouble. These men bring me&#xD;
their goods by night, and if you will go below&#xD;
under the foundation of the inn, by-and-by, I&#xD;
will show you how I received them from their&#xD;
boats secretly. Now, Beachampe," he added,&#xD;
"you are the very man I am looking for."&#xD;
"Make it profitable to me, and I will join&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"That I promise. I have been trying to find&#xD;
a man to go into this business with me on -a&#xD;
larger scale, and more than once thought of&#xD;
you and wondered where you could be cruising.&#xD;
You have come back in the nick of time. In&#xD;
the hopes of getting some larger vessel, I i&#xD;
structed the captain of the James-"&#xD;
Is he your partner, also?" asked Nevil,&#xD;
with surprise.&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
Your plan enlarges."&#xD;
"The captain of the James is fond of gaming.&#xD;
He has relatives living near York, and a year&#xD;
ago, when his vessel was in port, he came down&#xD;
here to see them. He was in my tap room&#xD;
every night. After I shut up, he and two or&#xD;
three others would remain and go into the card&#xD;
room up stairs and play half the night. He&#xD;
lost everything. I had to loan him money to&#xD;
get back his watch he pledged, and to get to&#xD;
Baltimore."&#xD;
" What security did he give you ?"&#xD;
" I knew a gambler will be tempted to do any&#xD;
villany, so I told him I would loan him the&#xD;
money if he would afford me facilities in smug-&#xD;
gling by his ship. At first he objected ; but&#xD;
finally he signed the compact with me. Now,&#xD;
( expect his vessel in a few weeks,-for it was&#xD;
&#xD;
six months ago we bargained together,-and as&#xD;
he will bring a valuable venture for me to take,&#xD;
[ want to have a larger vessel than Skipwith&#xD;
has. Now listen to me."&#xD;

"I will hear every word."&#xD;
"If you will go to Baltimore and look out&#xD;
there a fast sailing clipper schooner of about&#xD;
fifty tons, I will place the money in your hands&#xD;
to purchase her. I know you are a judge of a&#xD;
vessel.  I will put to your use seven thousand&#xD;
dollars, with which to buy the vessel, man her&#xD;
and provision her. She must have a crew of&#xD;
eighteen men. Your former friend who used&#xD;
to visit you here from  Baltimore, is here in&#xD;
York now, and looks like a rogue, and I have&#xD;
no doubt will be easily induced to ship as next&#xD;
in command to you."&#xD;
" Do you mean Jack Lastels ?"&#xD;
"That is his name."&#xD;
"He will not be backward if he should hap-&#xD;
pen to be out of money."&#xD;
" Ie looks ready, and drinks at the tap on&#xD;
credit."&#xD;
"Then he is fit for treasons, stratagems and&#xD;
spoils. When a man gets so -low as to get his&#xD;
liquor on tick, he's easily won to anything. I'll&#xD;
do it, Blouster."&#xD;
"This vessel must have arms to resist, if the&#xD;
revenue cutter should trouble you.  You must&#xD;
not allow yourself to be boarded with a cargo&#xD;
in."&#xD;
" It is likely to be a pretty active and dan-&#xD;
gerous business."&#xD;
" I trust to your discretion and coolness. I&#xD;
don't think much -of your morals, Mr. Bea-&#xD;
ehanppe; but I know you are brave, and have&#xD;
judgment, and are long headed enough."&#xD;
Our readers now understand the origin of&#xD;
the bond of union between Beachampe and the&#xD;
host of the Light in the Binnacle. We have&#xD;
now to relate an event that portrays the charac-&#xD;
ter of this young man in colors still darker&#xD;
than any with which he has been hitherto repre-&#xD;
sented. The night of the day on which the&#xD;
conversation and interview above described took&#xD;
place, Nevil left the Inn, and took his way to&#xD;
Beachamnpe Hall. He had not been there for a&#xD;
&#xD;
out, he took up in an iron skillet several live&#xD;
coals which he covered over by heaping the&#xD;
&#xD;
Colonel Beachampe had not seen any one for&#xD;
some months after the forgery of his son was:&#xD;
discovered by him; but that at length be sent&#xD;
for lawyers and made his will, in which he be-&#xD;
queathed all his estate, real and personal, to his&#xD;
niece, Kate Beachampe, born in England. A&#xD;
few weeks after mating thg will lie died.  The&#xD;
hall, in the meanwhile, was in possession of one&#xD;
of the executors, who had moved into it to pre-&#xD;
serve it until the arrival of the heiress, who&#xD;
was, said Blouster, expected in a few weeks.&#xD;
In the mood which this intelligence had put&#xD;
him into, the outlawed heir of Beachampe Hall&#xD;
now approached the home from which his vices&#xD;
and crimes had driven him. It was a clear,&#xD;
starry  night.  He knew every footpath, and&#xD;
walked on with familiar step, until he came&#xD;
within sight of its tall and imposing northern&#xD;
front. Lights shone through the windows of&#xD;
the room where he had last parted with his&#xD;
father. A light was also glimmering through&#xD;
the Venetian shutters of the apartment in which&#xD;
his mother had died in his boyhood. He gnashed&#xD;
his teeth together and clenched his fists with&#xD;
rage, to see strangers in possession of what he&#xD;
deemed was rightfully his own.&#xD;
With the furtive step of a burglar he stole up&#xD;
to the portico, and climbing up, looked in at the&#xD;
windows. He saw a family group, a father,&#xD;
mother, two daughters and a son.   The son&#xD;
was his own age, and he had always hated him&#xD;
for his superior virtues. This sight filled his&#xD;
cup of bitter revenge to the brim.  Heregained&#xD;
his feet and walked across the lawn until he&#xD;
came to a gate ; this he opened, and going for-&#xD;
ward, soon reached the stables and wood-sheds.&#xD;
Here he turned to the left and cautiously ap-&#xD;
proached two or three brick negro houses in the&#xD;
rear. One of those was the kitchen. He look-&#xD;
ed in at the low windows and saw that all was&#xD;
silent and dark, save a faint glimmer from a fire&#xD;
brand, half covered up in the ashes. The door,&#xD;
on being tried by him, was, as he expected,&#xD;
only shut, and unfastened. He softly entered&#xD;
and approached the hearth. Raking the ashes&#xD;

leaped the farthest gate, and fled to a wooded&#xD;
hill a quarter of a mile off. Here, for the&#xD;
first time, he stopped and looked round. The&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
skillet with ashes. He then took from the side&#xD;
of the fire place a bundle of pine sticks, placed&#xD;
there to kidle the fire with early in the morn&#xD;
ing. With these under his arm and the iron&#xD;
vessel of concealed coals in his hand, he left the&#xD;
premises without disturbing a negro boy who&#xD;
lay asleep by the hearth.&#xD;
On gaining the yard he returned by the way&#xD;
of the stables and wood shed. From the latter&#xD;
he took several sticks of wood and'added them&#xD;
to the kind lings. He then looked cautiously&#xD;
on all sides and listened attentively, to ascertain&#xD;
if any one was moving out of doors. Finding&#xD;
all quiet, he crossed the yard to the rear of the&#xD;
house, concealed by a hedge that bordered one&#xD;
side of the garden.  In the rear of the mansion&#xD;
was a gallery supported on square stones, with&#xD;
spaces for light and ventilation into the cellar.&#xD;
He reached this gallery, and stooping, passed&#xD;
under it. As he did so, a huge dog leaped from&#xD;
beneath the floor where he had been lying, and&#xD;
seized hin by the shoulder.&#xD;
" Down, Nero, down," he whispered, hoarse-&#xD;
ly, while he writhed with pain.  "Off, sir !&#xD;
Don't you know your master ?"&#xD;
But the faithful dog did not recognize in the&#xD;
husky whisper the voice of his master, nor in&#xD;
the apparent thief, his person. So be buried&#xD;
his teeth deeper into his flesh and threw himself&#xD;
upon him. It was too confined a place' for&#xD;
Nevil, thus arrested in his nefarious purposes,&#xD;
to stand up ; but he tried to use his knife, and&#xD;
after a fearful struggle he at length succeeded&#xD;
in burying it in the heart of his trustful dog.&#xD;
He now   released himself from his weight and&#xD;
crawled farther under the piazza. He now pro-&#xD;
ceeded to lay the kindling in order in a corner,&#xD;
and having done so, he proceeded to the other&#xD;
extremity and placed his wood there. He then&#xD;
set the last pile on fire ,and crept hastily away&#xD;
to the first, which he also kindled. He then&#xD;
made his way out from beneath the gallery over&#xD;
the body of Nero, and with the speed of a deer&#xD;
rail across the yard, skulked along the hedge&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
house was in sight. There was no sign of fire&#xD;
having seized upon it, and he was beginning to&#xD;
think he should have to return and coinplete his&#xD;
work, when a faint gleam lighted up the wall&#xD;
and roof of the stable as if reflected. But he&#xD;
could still see no fire, as the lower part of the&#xD;
house was hid by trees. But the light on the&#xD;
stable grew brighter and more ruddy.&#xD;
" It will burn !." he said, exultingly. " That&#xD;
glare is from under the, portico as from the&#xD;
mouth of a furnace. It will soon break out !&#xD;
There it leaps !'&#xD;
He was right. The fire did leap suddenly&#xD;
into view from the floor of the portico. It be-&#xD;
gan to curl around the columns and run along&#xD;
the architecture. le clapped his hands and&#xD;
shouted with exultation. He saw the red flames&#xD;
hiss along the dry roof of the gallery and then&#xD;
flash out of the lower windows. He saw 'the&#xD;
inmates flying hither and thither in consternation.&#xD;
lie heard the shouts of the gentlemnan and his&#xD;
son calling to the slaves to assist in saving the&#xD;
furniture. He beheld the fire burst out of the&#xD;
upper windows, and he heard- the roar of the&#xD;
vast conflagration. It made his heart bound&#xD;
with joy. He saw a negro 'mounted on a horse&#xD;
galloping past at mad speed, raising the alarm,&#xD;
towards town ; but he only laughed, knowing&#xD;
that before aid could reach the spot, the hall&#xD;
would be but a scathed and smoking ruin.  So&#xD;
rapidly did the flames seize upon the whole&#xD;
house, that in twenty minutes it was all one sheet&#xD;
of flame, and shooting far up into the dark sky,&#xD;
lighted up the sea for many a league, and re-&#xD;
vealed the spires of York with the distinctness&#xD;
of noonday. Concealed from hurrying passers-&#xD;
by hastening to the scene, by climbing into a&#xD;
tree, the guilty author of this devastation sat&#xD;
calmly watching it. He saw the last flame ex-&#xD;
pire and only blackened masses of smoke roll&#xD;
from it in a dark cloud over the bay.&#xD;
" That deed of revenge is done," he said, in&#xD;
aL tone of sullen exultation, as he descended&#xD;
from his place of concealment;- " and much joy&#xD;
do. I wish my cousin of her inheritance in Bea-&#xD;

his wakeful conscience compelled him to review After examining her a moment, he removed&#xD;
each' item of his past career, as we have done, the glass from his eye and shook his head :&#xD;
&#xD;
stiff red beard. He was muscular and fleshy,&#xD;
and had a stern visage that was unprepossessing,&#xD;

&#xD;
Yes, T thought so," answered his first offi-&#xD;
cer, a frank, sailor like looking, middle aged man,&#xD;
with gray, busl y whiskers and pea jacket, in&#xD;
which lie kept his hands, as he paced three&#xD;
paces fore and aft the lauiboard side of the quar-&#xD;
ter deck. ' I i(n't like the cut of his jib ; and&#xD;
besides, when I first imade him out he was stand-&#xD;
ing down the coast this way, but afterwards&#xD;
hauled his winl and ran away from the land on&#xD;
the course he is now steering."&#xD;
jtWell, our business is not with vessels bound&#xD;
out, but bound in, Manley," answered the con-&#xD;
mander, carektsly ; " it is likely some Baltimore&#xD;
slipper on a cruise."&#xD;
" Perhaps a slaver!"&#xD;
"Likely ; for more than one has sailed down&#xD;
this bay, and after getting into the tropics hoist-&#xD;
ed the African flag."&#xD;
The Dancing Star, in the meanwhile, contin-&#xD;
ued her course down the bay. The sun rose&#xD;
and ushered in a brilliant morning. The waves&#xD;
sparkled in its beams, and the shores became a&#xD;
brighter green and the skies a deeper blue.&#xD;
The canvass of the schooner shone whiter than&#xD;
snow in its light, and far along the surface of&#xD;
the bay was seen the little sails of the early fish-&#xD;
ing boats dotting the water.&#xD;
In a little while the capes of the bay opened&#xD;
oceanWard to the sight of Nevil as he stood on&#xD;
his deck, and about ten in the morning his ves-&#xD;
sel was dancing over the swell of the ocean with&#xD;
the westernmost cape on his starboard quarter.&#xD;
He now brought his schooner to, and taking his&#xD;
glass, surveyed carefully the eastern board.&#xD;
But seeing no other sail in sight than two&#xD;
hermaphrodite brigs standing southward,- and a&#xD;
topsail schooner steering north-east, and half a&#xD;
dozen fishing smacks scudding about, he made&#xD;
sail once more, and running west, came to with.-&#xD;
in half a mile of the light house. Here lie&#xD;
hoisted a signal to the fore, which was an-&#xD;
swered by a boat putting off from a cove near&#xD;
the light house and pulling towards him. It&#xD;
contained three men, two negro rowers, and a&#xD;
white man, with fiery red hair, red face, and a&#xD;
&#xD;
resist a revenue vessel if it were disposed to&#xD;
board you. - It would be hanging, sure."&#xD;
&#xD;
and which was not softened by a large fox-skin&#xD;
cap that be wore.&#xD;
" Glad to see you aboard, Skipwith," said&#xD;
Nevil, taking him by the hand as he crossed the&#xD;
gangway.&#xD;
"Ab, Master Beachampe, so it is you!" an-&#xD;
swered the man, looking pleased at the recogni-&#xD;
tion, and smiling, well satisfied as be glanced&#xD;
about the armed and well manned deck. " I&#xD;
half suspected it when I saw your signal; for&#xD;
vessels of your tonnage don't usually trouble&#xD;
themselves about calling for pilots when they&#xD;
run in or out. By all that's saucy, you've got&#xD;
a dashing craft here. Captain Blouster told&#xD;
me, when I was up at York last week, all about&#xD;
you, and how he was expecting you."&#xD;
" What day do you look for the James ?"&#xD;
asked Beachampe, after taking him down into&#xD;
the cabin, and setting some Scheidam before&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"She's due. She ought to have been in&#xD;
days ago," answered the pilot, pouring out a&#xD;
glass of the liquor. "But you had best not&#xD;
think of going off the coast to meet her; if you&#xD;
cruise between the capes you'll soon see her&#xD;
corning in."&#xD;
" How shall I know her if I should see her&#xD;
so far down the bay as this, before she thinks it&#xD;
time to hoist her signal."&#xD;
"By the letter J   in her f&amp;amp;e-top gallant&#xD;
sail."&#xD;
"I'll remember it."&#xD;
Some further conversation took place upon&#xD;
other matters, when Skipwith, looking at the&#xD;
circle of weapons about the lower part of the&#xD;
mainmast, which, as we have said, was cased in&#xD;
mahogany and passed through the cabi, said :&#xD;
" By the reef of Hatteras, Master Beachampe,&#xD;
but you have a pretty craft, and well armed and&#xD;
manned. One would swear you had something&#xD;
else in your eye besides smuggling."&#xD;
." One needs to go well armed even in sug-&#xD;
gling, pilot, if one doesn't want a revenue officer&#xD;
on his deck."&#xD;
" That's true. But it would hardly be safe to&#xD;

"I'll be hanged, then, if I let one come on&#xD;
board my vessel. It is -llouster's mind as well&#xD;
as, my own, not to suffer one of those fellows to&#xD;
"I    step foot on our deck."&#xD;
In that case, you are well fitted to carry&#xD;
out your mind. You are armed and manned&#xD;
like a buccaneer."&#xD;
"Well," laughed Beachampe, "if smuggling&#xD;
does not prove profitable enough, who knows&#xD;
k     but we may try our hand to something a little&#xD;
more exciting."&#xD;
"Ah, captain, I see you are a bold man !&#xD;
You would as leif, I dare swear, to pirate as&#xD;
smuggle," said Skipwith, who had drank a good&#xD;
deal of gin, and was not particular about his&#xD;
words.&#xD;
Better men than I have hoisted the black&#xD;
fag, Skipwith, and I may do it yet."&#xD;
Then, by the lord Harry, I am your mang"y&#xD;
You, pilot ?"&#xD;
      "Yes, Dick Shipwith, master. I have not&#xD;
always been a pilot. It's a tame life that is not&#xD;
after my liking. 'Whenever you want to know&#xD;
whether Dick will go with you, just .come off the&#xD;
cape here and hoist the black flag. He'll be&#xD;
withyou in the flash of a belaying pin. Money&#xD;
is to be made with a bold captain and a craft&#xD;
like thi, When I was younger than I am now,&#xD;
I've seen seventy thousand dollars in gold&#xD;
change ships in a jiffy."&#xD;
" When was that, Skipwith ?" asked Bea-&#xD;
champe, his eyes brightening up.&#xD;
"It was in-let me see-1820 something,&#xD;
off the Tortugases. I was second officer-lufg',&#xD;
as we was called by our sea dogs, and my cap-&#xD;
tain was the famous Spaniard, Don Caracca,&#xD;
who was afterwards hangedl at Havana."&#xD;
" Then you have been a pirating, hey,&#xD;
Skipwith?"&#xD;
" To be sure I have, and I don't care who&#xD;
(knows it," answered the pilot, filling his glass&#xD;
for the sixth time. " It is a honor to have sail-&#xD;
ed under the free flag, say I, to be kings of&#xD;
the ocean.''&#xD;
&#xD;
" Well, about this affair off Tortugas ?"&#xD;
"Why, we captured a Spanish ship from&#xD;
Vera Cruz, after a long chase, and robbell her;&#xD;
&#xD;
and what is better, the ship was commanded by&#xD;
Caracca's own brother.  You should have seen&#xD;
them meet on her deck, and then fight. I nev-&#xD;
er saw so fierce a fight; but our captain got the&#xD;
best of it, and ran his-brother twice through the&#xD;
body. We then set fire to the ship. Ah, those&#xD;
were rare times, Master Beachampe. If I had&#xD;
the command of" such a fine craft as this, I'd&#xD;
not skulk about the bay here watching for goods,&#xD;
silks, and cigars, and such like, but i'd scour&#xD;
the free sea and enrich myself with gold. If&#xD;
you are going against the laws o' the country,&#xD;
you might as well be hanged for killing a king&#xD;
as killing a beggar."&#xD;
"-You're half right, Skipwith ; but I'll try&#xD;
smuggling awhile first. I'm not fond of blood-&#xD;
shedding.  I hate to kill a man unless in self-&#xD;
defence."&#xD;
"Men is made to die. If yo   don't kill a&#xD;
man, he must die some other way."&#xD;
"But my conscience, Skipwith."&#xD;
" What ?"&#xD;
" My conscience, you know."&#xD;
"What is it?"&#xD;
What is what ?"-&#xD;
"Conscience you talk about. Is it a punish-&#xD;
ment found' out worse nor hanging, that you&#xD;
seem to be so afraid on it ?"     o&#xD;
"It is one's conscience, you know, that is all&#xD;
I can say of it."&#xD;
" You keep me in the dark. Never heard&#xD;
on it afore."&#xD;
At this confession, which came seriously and&#xD;
naturally from him, Beachampe laughed, while&#xD;
the pilot, filling his glass, drank :&#xD;
"Here's luck to the Dancing Star; under&#xD;
whatsomever flag she hoists-and may conscience&#xD;
be hanged, if it has -any neck to fasten the noose&#xD;
of two fathom of rope about 1"&#xD;
" Sail ho !" came cheerily from the deck-.&#xD;
"'A sail in sight, Skipwith. It may he our&#xD;
man !" exclaimed Beachampe, going to the&#xD;
depk, to which he was followed by the pilot,&#xD;
whose libations had made himn half seas over.&#xD;
&#xD;
But his brain did not more reel with liquor than&#xD;
did Nevil's reel with the intoxicating ideas he&#xD;
had imbued from him of acquiring sudden&#xD;
wealth by hoisting the free flag.&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
"Sail ho /"   The revenue cutter. Determi-&#xD;
nation to elude her.  On board the lames.&#xD;
Removal of contraband goods.  The cutter&#xD;
in pursuit. The police ojf!cer again.&#xD;
PON gaining the deck, Nevil Beachampe&#xD;
called out to the man aloft who had seen&#xD;
the sail:&#xD;
" Whither away?"&#xD;
" Sou'-byeast, sir," answered the lookout.&#xD;
The captain of the Dancing Star turned his&#xD;
glass in the direction indicated, and from the&#xD;
deck could see the topsails, resting on the line&#xD;
of the horizon, of a ship standing for the entrance&#xD;
,of the bay. She was too far off to distinguish,&#xD;
any mark in her sails, if any existed.&#xD;
"What do you make her out, sir ?" inquired&#xD;
Lastels.&#xD;
"A   ship steering for the Capes ; but she is&#xD;
hull down. - As she lifts, I shall be able to tell&#xD;
her quality better."&#xD;
It ought to-to be-be the Ja-James," answered&#xD;
the pilot, who was so tipsy that he had to steady&#xD;
himself by a back-stay  " Do you see-see J in&#xD;
her fore-topsail ?'"&#xD;
"I believe. I see something painted there,"'&#xD;
answered Nevil. - " But we shall know in good&#xD;
time. She is bringing a good breeze to the main&#xD;
along with her 1"&#xD;
" Sail ho?!" called out a man from the heel&#xD;
of the bowsprit; and he pointed in the north-&#xD;
eastern direction.&#xD;
"One or the other on 'em is the J-J-James,&#xD;
or I hope I may be eaten by sharks !" said&#xD;
Skipwith, standing unusually straight,.in order&#xD;
to keep himself from falling over. '&#xD;
" The new corner is a brig, square rigged,"&#xD;
answered the young officer, Lastels, who had&#xD;
directed his glass towards. -&#xD;
" Sail h&amp;amp;'." again shouted the lookout.&#xD;
" We are having a tea-tea-tea par-t-ty," stut-&#xD;
tered Skipwith. " Plen-ty-ty o' room-let 'em&#xD;
co-come."&#xD;
" Where away ?" called out Nevil, who cduld&#xD;
&#xD;
see nothing of the new comer anywhere on the&#xD;
sea line.&#xD;
5&#xD;
&#xD;
" To the nor'-west, sir-up the bay."&#xD;
I see her. It is the revenue cutter coming&#xD;
down," he answered, with heightened celor.&#xD;
"He'llspoil our sport if the ship is the James.&#xD;
Skipwith, take to your boat and go to your&#xD;
landing-place. I am going to make sail and run&#xD;
out and gain the ship outside, before the cutter,&#xD;
which is full six miles off, can get down."&#xD;
" That's the Tway, sir-that's the way."&#xD;
" And look you, are you sober ?"         -&#xD;
" As a purser, if I've anything to make me&#xD;
so, sir.&#xD;
" You must be sober, then. , The cutter must&#xD;
be misled with regard to my quality. You will&#xD;
leave us and stand rin shore ; and when you see&#xD;
her coming down, and likely to pass the Capes,&#xD;
you crops her forefoot is if you were t running&#xD;
out to Pilot the ship in, and if they don't hail&#xD;
you, you will volunteer to tell them that my&#xD;
schooner is a Spanish revenue cutter, built in&#xD;
Baltimore, and now going out to take her sta-&#xD;
tion at Cuba."&#xD;
"Capital story. I'll do-it. You may trusts&#xD;
me ; I think I'm sober now, sir-or I will b.&#xD;
afore the cutter gets down the bay."&#xD;
Skipwith let the Dancing Star in his bet,.&#xD;
and the schooner at once filled away and stood -'&#xD;
straight out to sea, under two jibs, main and (&#xD;
foresail, and a flying topsail, which was bellying r&#xD;
out steadily before a nor'-west breeze. The&#xD;
distance between the inbound ship.and schooner$k&#xD;
now rapidly diminished ; and- in half an hour&#xD;
after she was first seen her hull was visible-&#xD;
and, what was more, the letter J was plainly&#xD;
to be read with the glass, in her fore-topsail,&#xD;
though as she was close hauled, it was some&#xD;
time before it was made out .to be this and no&#xD;
other letter.&#xD;
As soon as B3eachanmpe satisfied himself of'.&#xD;
this fact, he ordered his boy Cato, who was&#xD;
with him, to bring up from below a bundle of'&#xD;
flags. These he poured out on the deck, and&#xD;
from among, the parti-dolored'- heap selected a'&#xD;
cross-barred'revenue 'flage This he l bent on to&#xD;
&#xD;
the signal halyards, and sent the rest below&#xD;
save one other, which was ared flag with a white&#xD;
crosa in it. He then looked astern to see- what&#xD;

had become of the cruiser, w ich. he saw still&#xD;
coming, down the bay, as steadily and under as&#xD;
crowded sail, as if she had an errand at sea,;in-&#xD;
stead of her usual loitering, watching and laying&#xD;
by system.  She was, however, five miles off,&#xD;
'Te sbip was only two miles ahead.,&#xD;
S"I have plenty of time to accomplish my er-&#xD;
rand;" said Nevil, to Lastels, with'aproud and&#xD;
defiant smile; "and if, after I get the freight&#xD;
on board, the cutter dares to be inquisitive, it&#xD;
wont be my fault if we ; don't have a fight.  I&#xD;
am not in the humor to have my path crossed by&#xD;
any man, much less by Henry Mainwaring.   If&#xD;
a he knows when he is well off, he had better not&#xD;
venture to be too particular to know who we&#xD;
The two vessels were now drawing nearer and&#xD;
nearer to each other, when Ythe shigwhich was&#xD;
:bowliiig along with slow and stateiyAmajesty,&#xD;
displayed her colors.  They were the stars and&#xD;
stripes, and waved in scarlet splendor -to the&#xD;
wind.&#xD;
"Hoist away and answer him," said Nevil,&#xD;
to his lieutenant; and the revenue flag, with&#xD;
the stripes perpendicular across it, fluttered at&#xD;
the peak of the schooner.&#xD;
"Now steer so as to come to under her---&#xD;
be a: little ahead of her,' said Nevil, to the&#xD;
helmsman.&#xD;
aThe ship was now so: near that every rope&#xD;
and sparrwas distinct, and the heads of the men&#xD;
could be discerned above' her bulwarks., The&#xD;
&#xD;
The captain was seen to leap into the mizzen&#xD;
rigging with his speaking trumpet in his hand.&#xD;
Nevil ordered Cato to bring him his. At the&#xD;
same time he directed Lastels to be ready to&#xD;
hoist the red flag with the white cross at the&#xD;
fore.&#xD;
"Ship ahoy 1" he shouted, through his trum-&#xD;
pet, as the two vessels drew within speaking&#xD;
distance of each other.&#xD;
Ahoy, the cutter 1"&#xD;
"What ship is that G            t&#xD;
The James, bound from Genoa to Balti-&#xD;
more."&#xD;
"Heave to!   Hoist away, Lastels," he cos,-&#xD;
wgnded to one =4 whispered   ' theQthdr; yd&#xD;
&#xD;
the white cross rose to ;the foremast head, and,&#xD;
was immediately lowered again.&#xD;
The captain of the lames no sooner saw this&#xD;
signal, than he answered with alacrity:&#xD;
"Ay, ay !" and immediately he was 'heard&#xD;
givig orders to lay the main-topsail of his ship&#xD;
to the mast.&#xD;
Nevil also brought the schooner into the wind,&#xD;
and as soon as both vessels became stationary&#xD;
abeam of each other, he ordered his boat to row&#xD;
him on board. Upon reaching the deck, he&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"I wish to see you in your cabin, captain."&#xD;
This was spoken with an air of authority, and&#xD;
in the presence of several passengers, one of&#xD;
whom the eye of Nevil discovered to be 'a lovely&#xD;
girl, of about nineteen, with a superb figure, and&#xD;
the finest blue eyes he ever saw. But he had&#xD;
no time to indulge in his admiration for beauty.&#xD;
The' captain, with a look of misgiving, and-&#xD;
changing countenance, preceded him into the&#xD;
cabin.                        r&#xD;
"You are Captain Hardrun ?" said Nevil.&#xD;
"Yes-and are you a revenue officer ?"&#xD;
" Do you think so ?-not exactly. Did you&#xD;
not see the signal ?"&#xD;
"Yes; but your vessel, your uniform, your&#xD;
flag and all, as well as your mannei--"&#xD;
"My manner is assumed.   I am here to re-&#xD;
ceive goods from you, that I understand are&#xD;
shipped, but are not in the bill of lading. I&#xD;
shall take them out as a revenue officer, so that&#xD;
your men and passengers will have no suspicion."&#xD;
" You are then in the confidence of--"&#xD;
"Captain Blouster. Here are my instruc-&#xD;
tions and a letter to you."&#xD;
S" All is right.  You shall have the goods at&#xD;
once; gut demand them of mue on deck." .&#xD;
"1 i*il1 do so. Make your men work active-&#xD;
ly, for there is a genuine revenue vessel' coming&#xD;
down the bay."&#xD;
" I have, no time then to lose. Blouster' has&#xD;
taken me quite by surprise in a nding a vessel&#xD;
like this."&#xD;
Upon deck, Nevil loudly demanded the bales.&#xD;
&#xD;
and boxes to be given up which were not on the&#xD;
manifest, and the hatches being opened, and the&#xD;
&#xD;
f&#xD;

&#xD;
goods all being placed on the top, in half an&#xD;
hour the whole had been placed in boats and&#xD;
conveyed on board the Dancing Star,-Nevil&#xD;
carefuly superintending the transfer. l1e then.'&#xD;
openly gave a receipt to the captain, and signed&#xD;
Henry Mainwaring's name to it, acknowledging'&#xD;
having taken' out' the goods. All' this was to&#xD;
blind the crew and passengers, who were sup-&#xD;
posed to know so little of the revenue cutter's&#xD;
powers and the mysteries of the revenue law,&#xD;
that dust could be easily thrown into their eyes,&#xD;
as doubtless it was.&#xD;
By the time the packages had been placed on&#xD;
boars the schooner, the revenue cutter was with-&#xD;
in a mile, and the pilot boat of Skipwith still&#xD;
nigher. The revenue flag 'had, been hauled&#xD;
down as soon as Nevil had got on board the&#xD;
ship, as it was not his purpose to attract by it&#xD;
the attention of Mainwaring. But the red and&#xD;
white signal still flew at the fore. He now re-&#xD;
turned to his vessel, but not without a strong&#xD;
inclination to carry off the young girl as contra-&#xD;
band also ; but he had not yet fully made up&#xD;
his mind to be a pirate.&#xD;
Upon regaining his own deck, he filled away&#xD;
at once, and stood south under all sail. The&#xD;
ship also squared away and resumed her course,&#xD;
her cargo fifteen thousand dollars less in value&#xD;
than it had been three quarters of an hour be-&#xD;
fore, while her treacherous captain, in anticipa-&#xD;
tion, was richer in proportion, according to the-&#xD;
share of the profits that might be by-and-by paid&#xD;
over to him by Blouster from the. proceeds oft&#xD;
the sales.&#xD;
The revenue cutter, after having got down&#xD;
the bay as far as the Capes, had crossed the&#xD;
course of Skipwith's boat, and hailed him.&#xD;
" Ho, pilot, what rakish looking schooner is&#xD;
that standing east ? Were you not on board of&#xD;
her ?"&#xD;
" Yes. She says she is built for a Spanish&#xD;
revenue cutter, and is bound for Cuba," an-&#xD;
swered Skipwith.  "A. fine vessel and well&#xD;
appointed."&#xD;
&#xD;
"But that is not her course,": said the com-&#xD;
mander of the cutter.  "She is steering east."&#xD;
"She wants to send some message 'back to.&#xD;
&#xD;
the city by the ship, for there was something&#xD;
said about it," replied the inventive pilot-for&#xD;
wrong ever seeks lies to. conceal itself. Arid&#xD;
the pilot by this time got out of heariri,darting&#xD;
away in his-boat like a flying bird.&#xD;
" Then we are mistaken,' sir," said Main-*&#xD;
waring, turning to a tall man, who stood on the&#xD;
deck by his side.&#xD;
"No.   The schooner is the same which I&#xD;
followed down in my- boat from  Baltimore,"'&#xD;
very decidedly answered the police officer whoni&#xD;
we last took'leave of as he was 'disappearing be-&#xD;
tween the two boats in York river, after Nevif&#xD;
had fired his pistol at him.  " There can be no&#xD;
mistake ; he has deceived the pilot."&#xD;
" Then let us overhaul him. I am willing toy&#xD;
give chase to discover whether it is the vessel&#xD;
you think it is."&#xD;
I t cannot be deceived."&#xD;
"She is making for the ship, and she hoists&#xD;
a flag."&#xD;
Henry Mainwaring's spyglass now remained&#xD;
at his eye for full a minute, before he could' sat'&#xD;
isfy himself that the flag he saw was 'that of the&#xD;
revenue service. 'When there was no room to&#xD;
doubt, he exclaimed, with surprise:&#xD;
"It is either a cutter, or, as yousay, a smu&#xD;
gler. But there is no cutter in the service like'&#xD;
that craft," added Henry. "But we will 'over-'&#xD;
haul her and know all about it."&#xD;
" The two vessels are alongside of one anoth-&#xD;
er," said the officer. "Mark my words, there&#xD;
is mischief there, and that you are wanted."  i,&#xD;
An order was at once given by Mainwaring&#xD;
to crowd all sail, and then to get ready for ac-&#xD;
tion. There were four six pounders and a twelve&#xD;
pounder in the cutter, with the usual supply 'o&#xD;
small arms, and about twenty men and officers.&#xD;
At the order tor clear for action, all was aniina.&#xD;
tion on board. The powder chest was opened,'&#xD;
and cartridges dealt out ; and the shot Iocke'&#xD;
supplied a pyramid of balls for each piece. -In&#xD;

&#xD;
The shore was about a quarter of a mile, and&#xD;
having reached it, he made his way to the town;&#xD;
and to the house of the chief of police there,&#xD;
whom he well knew. Here he dried his clothes&#xD;
and made known whaA had happened.&#xD;
" And your men ?" asked-the chief.&#xD;
" I saw the rogues all reach the land. They&#xD;
will be up to town and report my death. So&#xD;
much the better. They will' make their way&#xD;
back to Baltim.re, where I hired them. Now,&#xD;
I want you to get me 'a horse, strong and fleet."&#xD;
d' I can do so. But for what, colonel?" ask-&#xD;
ed the Viiinia policeman, giving his superior&#xD;
this title by way of respect for his talents, a com-&#xD;
mon way of showing respect in' America.&#xD;
"'It is about three hours' ride down the bay&#xD;

were going on board of. In/Hampton Roads I&#xD;
shall find some small vessel f war, which I can&#xD;
get the commander to get under weigh, and cut&#xD;
off the schooner before she reaches the Capes';&#xD;
for there is no wind scarcely, and 'she will be&#xD;
several hours getting down."&#xD;
" Are you going to arrest the schooner as a&#xD;
smuggler too ?"&#xD;
"I have' no proof of this charge. I only&#xD;
know' this ; 'when 'I heard in Baltimore that a&#xD;
vessel had been bought by a young stranger,&#xD;
and that he was secretlyshipping men for her,&#xD;
I of course, as in duty bound, kept a sharp eye&#xD;

him; and hlis secrecy only increased my sus-&#xD;

day approached when they would p obally sail,&#xD;
when bribing the wife-of the innkeeper; I tohl&#xD;
her to listen to every word spoken aiong then,&#xD;

gained, but not enough for me to act on; so I&#xD;
could do nothing but inform the colledtor of then&#xD;
port. But the same night the little schooner&#xD;
slipped out of'the harbor, and I feltas if I hid&#xD;
been fairly beaten ; for I had a presentiment;&#xD;
an irresistible-feeling, that if I could only have&#xD;
known the name of the captain, that I' woula&#xD;
have found some act associated with. the names&#xD;
which would give me authority to stop him, wil&#xD;

Also'try and hunt up my four men, and send&#xD;

In a few minutes, Vidoeq was spurring a fast&#xD;
and fleet horse'along the pebbly road that led to&#xD;
Hampton,'down the coast. It was a dark night,&#xD;
and he lost his yay twice, which left him sev-&#xD;
eral miles north of the place of his destination&#xD;
at sunrise.  He now could see the surface of the&#xD;
bay for many a mile to the north, but his keen-,&#xD;
est gaze could discover no vessel in sight that&#xD;
looked like the one of which he was in pursuit.&#xD;
He at length drew up at a small wayside inn,,&#xD;
not far from-'the beach, where he breakfasted.&#xD;
As he was about to mount, he saw that his horse&#xD;
had east a shoe,,and that another one was loose.&#xD;
In this emergency, and without a smith being&#xD;
near to aid him, he'left the animal at the inn to&#xD;
be sent back to York, and proceeded on foot;&#xD;
for in that desolate region there was not another&#xD;
horse  to be obtained.&#xD;
From time to tine he looked back, and at&#xD;
length he saw a schooner heave in 'sight from&#xD;
behind a jutting cape. At first sight he believ-&#xD;
ed it to be the Dancing Star, bat after a second&#xD;
look, he saw that it was larger and painted dif-{&#xD;
ferently, and carried two topsails, while the'&#xD;
Dancing Star carried but one. As it came on,&#xD;
he saw that she carried the revenue flag at her&#xD;
peak. His hopes now rose with this discovery,&#xD;
and he hastened towards a point of land that&#xD;
stietehed half a mile out from the coast, in hopes&#xD;
to signalize her,and bring her to. '.His attention&#xD;
was so much taken up with her, that he had got&#xD;
to the en4 of the cliff on the border of the shore&#xD;
before he discovered, far out in the bay, a sec-&#xD;
ond rakish looking vessel, which he was confi-&#xD;
dent was the'ecraft he sought.&#xD;
The revenue cutter at length saw the signals'&#xD;
that he made,' with his coat and hat fastened to&#xD;
a long pole, and as she was not more than a half&#xD;
a mile from the land, she hauled her wind and&#xD;
&#xD;
stood in shore, and sent her boat to know what&#xD;
was the matter. Vidocq desired to be taken on&#xD;
board ; but there being a spring there, the men,-&#xD;
&#xD;
75&#xD;
&#xD;
who had brought a cask with them, 'said"'their&#xD;
orders were to stop and fill, it. To roll 'it to the&#xD;
spring and fill it, and roll it back, required sone&#xD;
time; during which, the impatient officer saw&#xD;
the distant schooner, which he was certain was&#xD;
2Beachampe's vessel,' sailing past four miles off,&#xD;
and stretching away for the Capes. At length&#xD;
he was put on board 'the revenue cutter, made&#xD;
his official character known to Henry Mainwar-&#xD;
ing, and the character of the schooner, an i end-&#xD;
ed with soliciting his aid .to capture her.&#xD;
This Mainwaring proffered, and with the more&#xD;
'readiness, because he was at 'last likely to see&#xD;
brought to the end of his: career the dangerous&#xD;
and criminal young man who had so deeply&#xD;
outraged the affections of the unsuspecting Alice':&#xD;
and committed so many other'and various crimes.&#xD;
The cutter therefore made sail with Vidocq'on&#xD;
board, and commenced the chase of the schoog-&#xD;
er, passing Hampton Roads, and thinking only&#xD;
of overtaking the fugitive.' But we have seen&#xD;
how' the report of Skipwith, on being hailed, and&#xD;
the revenue flag hoisted by Beachampe, cast&#xD;
doubts   over Mainwaring's mind, whether he&#xD;
were in pursuit of the right vessel or not.&#xD;

" "Be she armeditli twentgoiirs and manned&#xD;

a le n pair of heels, you may be sure of&#xD;
And come to the worst, Beachampe will&#xD;
&#xD;
fight his vessel to the sinking before he'll&#xD;
surrender."&#xD;
It's a bad business, bad business," respond-&#xD;
ed the captain. of the James, 'shaking his head;&#xD;
it would have been safer to have trusted to&#xD;
the old way. But Blouster's haste to get riches&#xD;
is going to bring us all to the halter." H1e then&#xD;
cast an anxious glance after the revenue cutter,&#xD;
which, under the strengthening breeze now&#xD;
blowing,' went bowling off as it" emed to him&#xD;
at a tearing pace, which gave the  schooner but&#xD;
little chance of escape. Again he shook his-&#xD;
head, and bidding the pilot square away and&#xD;
lay' the ship's course up the pay, he went below&#xD;
and took a bottle of brandy out of his case of&#xD;
liquors, to-try and imbibe at'the mouth courage&#xD;
enough to balance that which was oozing out of&#xD;
the ends of his.fingers.&#xD;
The James once more went ronling and pitch-&#xD;
ing on her. way up on a north-westerly course&#xD;
past the Capes, and the revenue cutter steered&#xD;
strait after the Dancing   r' on a southern&#xD;
course.  By this time it  as two hours to sun-&#xD;
down, and the two vessel were not more than&#xD;
two miles and a half ap t, one right astern of&#xD;
the-pother. The wind was blowing a seven and,&#xD;
a half or eight knot breeze, and the ebb tide&#xD;
front the bay meeting the sea waves, produced a&#xD;
high ground swell, over which both vessels went&#xD;
dancing in the most dashing and graceful style.&#xD;
They were very much' alike in appearance, both&#xD;
being rakish, low in the hull, and saucily war-&#xD;
like in their aspect ; but the cutter was full one.,&#xD;
third larger.; but her metal and the number of,&#xD;
her men, did not exceed that of the Dancing-&#xD;
Star.&#xD;
When the cutter had been under sail from te&#xD;
James about fifteen minutes, she had all her'&#xD;
sail put on her that she 'could carry, and might&#xD;
,be said to be doing her best. The wind was&#xD;
blowing steadily -from north-north-west, and as&#xD;
both vessels were steering east by south, they&#xD;
both had the wind very free, indeed the cutter's&#xD;
topsail yards were almost squared.' The time&#xD;
was now an intensely exciting one. 'Henry&#xD;
&#xD;
Mainwaring had not only his very natural dis-&#xD;
like of Nevil Beachanipe to induce him to do-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE' DANCING STAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
sire to have him in his power, but he wanted to-&#xD;
capture the daring pirate, and to bring to pun.&#xD;
ishnent the forger. The police officer was so-&#xD;
licitous on his part to bring to a successful and&#xD;
triumphant issue, the, long chase he had been&#xD;
upon, and in which he had been so often baffled,&#xD;
as victory was a point of personal and profes-&#xD;
sional honor with him.&#xD;
"His capture, after all this," he said to him-&#xD;
self, as he paced the deck, "will be the highest&#xD;
feather yet in my cap.".&#xD;
The crew of the cutter, whose tame life in&#xD;
cruising up and down the bay with little to do,&#xD;
were all anxious for a little fighting to relieve&#xD;
their tedium; and smiles were on every face.&#xD;
After the sails were all set, to the belaying of an&#xD;
inch of egging, so that not a pull more or less&#xD;
could aid the vessel in her speed---after all the&#xD;
guns had been shotted, and every preparation&#xD;
made for action, there was nothing for the men&#xD;
to do but to loll over the foot of the bowsprit&#xD;
and forecastle bulwarks to watch and speculate&#xD;
upon the schooner,'Whichthey did not fail to do&#xD;
to the full vent of their fancies..&#xD;
"Shivermy timbers, Ben," saidau old cut-&#xD;
terman, who had been in the "venoo sarvice,"&#xD;
as he termed it, man and boy, five and thirty&#xD;
"years, "but that craft is a beauty and no mis-&#xD;

all the world like one of the pretty crafts one&#xD;
sees in the museums in glass cases."&#xD;
"Don't talk 'bout museum clippers, ship-&#xD;

len cap.  " They are 41 madeby land-lubbers.&#xD;

wa'nt may I never taste duff agen 1" .&#xD;
At this description there was a loud, scornful&#xD;
laugh, and it was voted that the lubber that&#xD;
made that craft ought to have hisl eyes swabbed&#xD;
out every morning with slush, eat oakumi for a&#xD;
month, and then be hanged to the fore yard arm..&#xD;
" Ken enny on ye make out what that ar' bit&#xD;
&#xD;
o' buntin'.is she 's flyin' to 'her fore ?" asked a&#xD;
&#xD;
sailor, whose physiognomy, as well as his accent,&#xD;
showed that he was a New England man.'- "I&#xD;
guess it's a queer pirate flag with a cross in it !"&#xD;
"Pirates al'ays hoist sich colors," answered&#xD;
an old salt; but the' mos' al'ays has cross bones&#xD;
and deth's headatween 'em. I doesn't 'member&#xD;
as I ever know'd one with on'y a cross bones."&#xD;
" Them ben't no cross bones ; but a reg'lar&#xD;
up and cross Roman idol," answered the Yan-&#xD;
kee. f' But we aint goin' to catch her. She's&#xD;
got heels as has spurs on 'em, you may be sure;&#xD;
and she kicks the water behindher as she goes,&#xD;
and laughs at us."&#xD;
The opinion expressed forward began to pre-&#xD;
vail aft. The cutter instead of gaining was&#xD;
evidently falling rapidly  astern ; and after&#xD;
another half hour the Dancing Star, instead of&#xD;
being only two and a-half miles off, was- full&#xD;
three. When this superiority of sailing on her&#xD;
part became apparent, the chagrin of Mainwar-&#xD;
ing could not be concealed, while Vidocq swore&#xD;
up and down like a buccaneer.&#xD;
" Is there no way of increasing the speed' of&#xD;
your vessel, captain?" he asked of him. " We&#xD;
are doing nothing but fall behind."&#xD;
" I see it- too plainly. That craft sails like&#xD;
the wind.. I can do no more unless I throw my&#xD;
guns overboard."&#xD;
" Over with them "&#xD;
"And what good would they do me when I&#xD;
should by this means come within range ?"&#xD;
".True. You must keep your guns. But I&#xD;
can't see her escape from  my grasp 'in this&#xD;
way."&#xD;
"I am quite as desirous of taking her as you&#xD;
can be," answered Mainwaring ; "and if we&#xD;
lose her, my disappointment will be as great."&#xD;
"'And do you'think we shall lose her ?"&#xD;
" I see no chance of getting any nigher. I&#xD;
have done my best. I never knew a craft sail&#xD;
like hei-. 'The only hope is--"&#xD;
"Is what ?"&#xD;
" That the wind may lull; and if it falls&#xD;
calm, we can i-each her with our boats."&#xD;
Vidocq cast an eager look over the sikies-&#xD;
&#xD;
The whole horizon was heavily filled up with&#xD;
great banks-of clouds, and there seemed rather&#xD;

to give up'the chase. Even Vidocq, when he&#xD;
saw the portentous aspect of the heavens, ,and&#xD;
heard the gathering winds roaring about his ears,&#xD;
made no objection; for he was well satisfiedthat&#xD;
any further stern chasing was useless,,and that&#xD;
to stand on a southern course longer would in-&#xD;
volve the vessel and all on board in the dangers&#xD;
which the coming:storm promised to bring upon&#xD;
all who were compelled that night. to be out&#xD;
upon the sea.J&#xD;
" Ready about 1  Helm   a lee :" shouted'&#xD;
&#xD;
Mainwaring, with more reluctance than he ever&#xD;

expectant.  Nothing could be donemore than'&#xD;

likelihood of increase of wind: by sundown than&#xD;
a lull.&#xD;
"No hope from a calm, I fear, sir."&#xD;
"No., It will come on to:blow by night, and&#xD;
then the schooner will have to shorten sail."&#xD;
"t And if you can carry longer than she, you&#xD;
can come up with her."&#xD;
"Yes; but she will carry as long as I shall&#xD;
dare 'to, be assured of that--and when it is time&#xD;
for her to take in and lay to, it will be for me.&#xD;
This is a dangerous coast to be caught on in an,&#xD;
easterly wind, for there is not a harbor for a;&#xD;
hundred miles.  The wind is hauling northerly,&#xD;
and will by-and-by come out of that :white spot&#xD;
in that mass of black clouds in the North-east."&#xD;
"I fear, then, we stand a bad,.chance for&#xD;
catching the schooner."-&#xD;
"I fear so ; bt:t I - will, stand on till Ilose&#xD;
sight of her in the night. Some accident-might&#xD;
bring her into our grasp, such as losing a top .&#xD;
mast, or the like."&#xD;
The revenue cutter, therefore, stood on,&#xD;
though warned, by the appearance of the sky&#xD;
that it would. beFrisking a great deal to be caught&#xD;
south of Cape Henry in a north-east gale. But&#xD;
a. hope re gained in Mainwaring's mind that&#xD;
some fortunate -ecident might enable him yet to&#xD;
place his vessel along side of the fugitive&#xD;
schooner.  But the sun went down, 'leaving the&#xD;
vessels three and a 'half miles apart, a league&#xD;
from the coast, and about twelve miles south of&#xD;
Cape Henry.   The deepening night at length&#xD;
hid the:Dancing Star entirely from the sight of&#xD;
the anxious and eager eyes on board the revenue&#xD;
&#xD;
bled to lay her course in the wind's eye and&#xD;
keep tolerably true to her helm; but she tossed&#xD;
&#xD;
called out those orders, before. The main-top-'&#xD;
sail and fore-topmast studding-sails were taken&#xD;
in previous to this order'; and the vessel close&#xD;
hauled laid her course east by north to gain an&#xD;
offing, in order, on the next tack, to weather&#xD;
Cape Henry and run into Hampton Roads. It,&#xD;
was a long step of twelve miles or more to take,&#xD;
on that tack before they would get abeam of the&#xD;
opening to the bay, and this in the prospect of a&#xD;
storm to burst upon them within an hour. The-&#xD;
wind, however, continued to blow strong and'&#xD;
steadily from west by north for about an hour,&#xD;
by which time the cutter had gained eight miles&#xD;
of her twelve. It then suddenly became calm;&#xD;
and the vessel was tossed. helplessly about on&#xD;
the huge billows without a breath of air.  The&#xD;
atmosphere was oppressive, and every sign fore&#xD;
told a sudden and: heavy gale, Like a good&#xD;
sailor, Mainwaring had the cutter put under.&#xD;
storm gear, With only his jib and foresail set.&#xD;
close reefed. The guns were lashed and every&#xD;
loose spar secured. -Suddenly in the east north-.&#xD;
east board was seen a whitish lighting up of the'&#xD;
sky in the angry spot which Mainwaring had:&#xD;
noticed there after the sun went down, aid afar&#xD;
off was heard a.low roar like the rambling voice}&#xD;
of a lion in the beginning of his rage. Louder-&#xD;
and louder it grew, an  yet nothing:else but the.&#xD;
fierce white spot was v' ible in any quarter, ndt&#xD;
even the black clouds 'ere distinguishable from&#xD;
the black sea.&#xD;
"Steady, men !   Stand to your posts!  Let&#xD;
no man flinch.  Three men at the helm, here,"&#xD;
said the, commander, calmly.. Vidocq stood&#xD;
near him,,in anxious anticipation of the result.&#xD;
Brave and resolute aJhe was, he felt that he was&#xD;
impotent there ; and he could not but admire&#xD;
and respect the steady courage of: the young&#xD;
commander and his men. There, was not a word&#xD;
heard that betrayed fear. All was .quiet, or-&#xD;
derly, professional. Louder came on the roar-&#xD;
ing winds, cand before them there suddenly be..&#xD;
came visible a broad cascade of phosphorescent&#xD;
light like a wild beast showing its front of glit-&#xD;
tering teeth in the darkness of his dent- All&#xD;
&#xD;
as it can't be helped, till we get better weather.&#xD;
or daylight. I wish you to keep a sharp look&#xD;

A-                                                                                                        4-                                     4--&#xD;
&#xD;
had been done. Human skill had completed&#xD;
its part, and now all that man . could do was to&#xD;
wait the event, trusting to Providence to temper&#xD;
the stroke that it might not destroy utterly.&#xD;
"Steady, men !" was- heard above the muf-&#xD;
fled roar the low vice of the commander encour-,&#xD;
aging his crew.  " Stand by with axes ready to&#xD;
cut away the masts .if she, is knocked on her&#xD;
beams. Head-her hard on.    Keep her head&#xD;
well up. Now,;look out all. There it comes&#xD;
Let the reader imagine a fall of water five or&#xD;
six feet high, and leagues in extent, rolling on-&#xD;
ward with, the tide of a broad river, and menac-&#xD;
ing everything in its path with destruction, and&#xD;
e will form  some idea of the danger which&#xD;
enaced the cutter.  The sea seemed to be lift-&#xD;
d like the crest of a lion over a wall of waves,&#xD;
which, as the captain spoke, came galloping on&#xD;
-With a roar that was deafening. The three men&#xD;
at the helm kept her bows head on to the foam-&#xD;
ing mass of waters, so that when they struck&#xD;
her, her bows first received the shock, and part-&#xD;
ly cleaving the liquid wall, and partly rising&#xD;
upon it, she shook through every joint, and&#xD;
reeled to starboard and larboard in the most&#xD;
frightful.manner, lashing the sea on both sides&#xD;
with the extremities of her yards. Part of the&#xD;
huge wall' of billows broke over the forecastle,&#xD;
and three feet deep rolled aft, sweeping men,&#xD;
spars, guns, and every moveable object along in&#xD;
its resistless course.  For a few seconds Main-&#xD;
waring, who had sprung into the main rigging to&#xD;
command a view of the whole danger, to direct&#xD;
and command his men, believed that she would&#xD;
never free herself from the score of tons 'of water&#xD;
that she had taken. in, and that she would go&#xD;
bodily down; but fortunately the larboard bul-&#xD;
warks gave way and the mass of sea rushed out,&#xD;
and clearing the decks, the vessel rose again&#xD;
from her half submerged condition and before&#xD;
the blast which had come riding on the top of&#xD;
the wave. The first shock past and the vessel&#xD;
alive, Mainwaring felt confidence, and as the&#xD;
three men at the helm had not left-it, but had&#xD;
been able to resist the deck wave, she was ena-&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
and pitched fearfully.  It did not take long,&#xD;
however, for the'young captain to see that his&#xD;
vessel was to be depended on, and that she&#xD;
would ride out the gale in safety, unlessit came&#xD;
on to blow a great deal harder than it did. It&#xD;
was perfectly dark, save the ghostly light emit-&#xD;
ted from the phosphorescence of the boiling sea&#xD;
around ; and Henry felt anxious to learn the&#xD;
mischief that had been done. With his trum-&#xD;
pet to his mouth he called for two battle lanterns&#xD;
to be lighted, and while this order was being&#xD;
obeyed, he was inquiring of those about him if&#xD;
any one had been lost overboard.  Some said&#xD;
yes, and others said no.  The lights at length&#xD;
came, and were slung one near the mainmast&#xD;
and the other forward of the foremast; and by&#xD;
these the whole of the decks could be seen, with&#xD;
the mischief that had been done. Two of the&#xD;
guns had broken from their lashings, and a pile&#xD;
of spars which, had been on one side of the ves-&#xD;
sel were.now on the other, farther aft. The ca-&#xD;
boose was lying upturned in the scuppers; the&#xD;
two harness-casks were rolling about the quar-&#xD;
ter-deck ; and every part of the deck was strewn&#xD;
with rigging uncoiled and blown and lashed&#xD;
about. These mishaps were repaired as well as&#xD;
possible; and after twenty minutes, the force of&#xD;
the gale abating, Henry determined to put some&#xD;
sail on her and try to lay his course. _ Under a&#xD;
close-reefed mainsail and foresail and half a jib,&#xD;
he steered by compass over the wild waters east&#xD;
by north.' But the little vessel struggled vio-&#xD;
lently over the rugged billows, and rose and&#xD;
pitched in enormous ascents and descents amid&#xD;
the mountainous;surges.&#xD;
"We have lost one man, sir," said the old&#xD;
lieutenant, coming up to Henry and speaking&#xD;
in a low voice.&#xD;
" Who is it ?"&#xD;
",That I can't say. I saw him washed past&#xD;
me over the taifrail when we shipped the sea;&#xD;
but I could do nothing for him in the uproar,&#xD;
~for it was as much as I could do to keep. my,&#xD;
feet myself."&#xD;
" Poor fellow; we .will say nothing about it,&#xD;

&#xD;
"Ay, ay, sir.  We have made a narrow es-&#xD;

"Welcome sound !" exclaimed Mainwaring.&#xD;
"There is the Cape light. It bears west north&#xD;
west. We can run in on the next tack."&#xD;
The sight of the light made every heart glad,&#xD;
and a murmur of satisfaction ran along the decks.&#xD;
The cutter now labored on her course heavily,&#xD;
hauled close so as to weather the Cape on this&#xD;
taek. The store , however, continued to in-&#xD;
crease, and they had to come to, so that it was&#xD;
three hours before they had accomplished the&#xD;
three miles which would place them far enough&#xD;
to windward to render it safe for thom to go&#xD;
about. Just as they were going in, an extreme-&#xD;
ly delicate maneeuvre in the height of so fierce&#xD;
a gale, all were startled by a sharp cry of "sail&#xD;
ho ! sail ho ! sail ho !" repeated from one of the&#xD;
men. Henry had only time to look round and&#xD;
see flitting through the darkness, not his vessel's&#xD;
length distant, the indistinct outline of a vessel,&#xD;
whieh seemed to be flying right across his quar-&#xD;
ter with fearful velocity. He could hardly&#xD;
make her out, her speed was so great and the&#xD;
night was so dark, but half a dozen voices ex-&#xD;
clamed, with eagerness:&#xD;
" It is the schooner!  It is the schooner !"&#xD;
But before he could satisfy himself of the&#xD;
truth of their assertion, she had disappeared in&#xD;
the darkness.&#xD;
"She was going on the starboard tack just as&#xD;
we were now," said the lieutenant to Henry,&#xD;
"and was right behind us on the same tack."&#xD;
"If I was sure it was the schooner."&#xD;
"Would you tack after her?"&#xD;
" Yes. Though in such a wild sea as this I&#xD;
could neither board her nor use our guns.'- If&#xD;
it is she, she is bound into the bay, you may&#xD;
rest assured of that. Vidocq's account of her&#xD;
&#xD;
"There she is! It is the schooner !" exclaim&#xD;
&#xD;
I  7-&#xD;
" '&#xD;
 4t&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
will soon be tacking to run into the bay. I&#xD;
wonder if she saw us."&#xD;
"She couldn't raake us out. If she is going&#xD;
into the bay, she wont stand on that leg long,&#xD;
but be after us out more to windward. but&#xD;
where is the police officer, Vidocq ?"&#xD;
" I haven't seen him since that- sea came&#xD;
aboard of us. Aint he below ?"&#xD;
" It is possible," answered Henryb; "ut he&#xD;
was standing there by the main-tojnast back&#xD;
stay when the gale came upon us.  Since then&#xD;
I have had no time to think about him."&#xD;
Vidocq was not, however, found below. He&#xD;
was sought about the decks fore and aft; but&#xD;
no one knew anything about him.&#xD;
" Call the roll of the men," said Henry to&#xD;
his boatswain.&#xD;
They were all called in a loud tone by name,&#xD;
and every man answered to it.&#xD;
" Not one of the crew is missing," said Hen-&#xD;
ry, " the man you saw washed overboard was&#xD;
the police officer, without doubt."&#xD;
Every part of the cutter was now searched&#xD;
with lanterns, and the painful'conclusion had at&#xD;
length to be arrived .at, that the police officer,&#xD;
who, not being a seaman, was less skilled in&#xD;
taking care of himself in such a crisis as the&#xD;
vessel had passed through, had been borne'on&#xD;
the mountain wave from his feet, and carried 6ff&#xD;
into the boiling ocean 'to perish unseen and&#xD;
unheard.!&#xD;
Hepry felt sad at this discovery, but he had&#xD;
no time to indulge regrets.  The wind was still&#xD;
very high, and the darkness, unrelieved even&#xD;
by lightning, was intense; and he -felt that there!&#xD;
was great danger of encountering the vessel&#xD;
which had flitted past, or some other. On this&#xD;
tack the water rushed through the gap made bfy&#xD;
the broken bulwarks in such ki quantity that it&#xD;
was found necessary to tack again, and finally&#xD;
to lay to so as to keep the shattered side to&#xD;
windward. In this manner the cutter had been&#xD;
lying about ten minutes, when the cry of " sail&#xD;
ho !" again sent all eyes searching into the&#xD;
darkness.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DANCING STAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
One of the first thoughts that came into the&#xD;
mind of the commander of the cutter, on the&#xD;
appearance of the light, was to look about to&#xD;
see if the schooner had also gained the bay; but&#xD;
far and wide but one object was. visible, and&#xD;
that was'a dismasted brig which was being borne&#xD;
along over the tumbling seas .towards Cape&#xD;
Henry.   With his glass he saw that there were&#xD;
signals of distress flying from the stump of the&#xD;
foremast, and he saw that nothing could prevent&#xD;
her from being dashed to pieces on the Cape,&#xD;
strait towards which she was being driven with-&#xD;
out power to escape the threatening danger. He&#xD;
instantly put the cutter about and lay his course&#xD;
so as to head her off, and if possible save the&#xD;
&#xD;
persons on board. On coming near her he a&#xD;
&#xD;
aw&#xD;
&#xD;
ed Henry.   'I can't mistake her."  And sure&#xD;
enough the Dancing Star came in sight, appear-&#xD;
ed in view a moment, sailing in the direction of&#xD;
the Capes, and was out of sight again in two&#xD;
minutes ; but she had come so near the cutter&#xD;
that her peculiar rake and size could be distin-&#xD;
guished by nautical eyes.&#xD;
"She is making for the bay," said Henry.&#xD;
" Come, men, lively. Lively there, carpenter !&#xD;
Get that big hole stopped up in any fashion to&#xD;
keep the sea out, so that I can tack and lay after&#xD;
this vessel."&#xD;
The carpenter and his hands, by the aid of&#xD;
lanterns, went busibly to work to plank up the&#xD;
bulwarks ; but it was two hours before they were&#xD;
made strong enough to withstand ,the rush and&#xD;
force of the water when she should lay down&#xD;
upon this side on 4he larboard tack. By the&#xD;
time this work was done, the storm had nearly.&#xD;
blown its cheeks out, and the main and foresail&#xD;
could be carried with only single reef; but the&#xD;
sea ran high and caused the cutter in her course&#xD;
to leap wildly from  sea to sea. It was just&#xD;
dawn as they came up with the light on Cape&#xD;
Henry, which was, slowly fading into the light of&#xD;
morning. - The roar of the surges against the&#xD;
rocks sounded like thunder as they drew nigh ;&#xD;
' and as they passed the Cape into the smoother&#xD;
water of the bay, the sun rose above the ocean,&#xD;
breaking the storm clouds away before it, and&#xD;
sending the splendor of its, beams over land and&#xD;
sea.&#xD;
&#xD;
the cutter, made it nearly noon by the time they&#xD;
reached Hampton Roads. Here they spoke a&#xD;

full twenty persons on her decks, all of whom&#xD;
were waving hands and signals to him for aid.&#xD;
It would have been madness to have attempted&#xD;
to- board her, as the sea was running very high,&#xD;
and both vessels were pitching upon it in a fear-&#xD;
ful way. But with. the skill of a thorough sta-&#xD;
man, Henry wore round under the stern of the&#xD;
wreck, and going forward, called to the persons&#xD;
to drop overboard one at the time and he would&#xD;
save them. For this purpose he lowered one of&#xD;
his boats, though very nearly swamping it, and&#xD;
also threw ropes and, buoys over for the swim-&#xD;
mers to catch to. In this way, while both&#xD;
vessels were in full headway towards the shore,&#xD;
he succeeded in saving all but the mate, who,&#xD;
resolving to be last, had remained on board till&#xD;
the brig had got so close to the breakers that it&#xD;
was no longer safe for the cutter to keep near&#xD;
her without sharing her fate ; Henry was,&#xD;
therefore, compelled to put about and try to&#xD;
beat off this lee shore the best he could, with&#xD;
the nineteen persons he had saved. He had&#xD;
hardly got the fore and main sheets hauled, when&#xD;
the brig struck and broke in two.' The mate,&#xD;
who had ran to the forward part of the vessel,&#xD;
leaped in the seething waves and was borne&#xD;
ashore upon the surges, and landed safely. At&#xD;
this all on board the cutter set up a shout of&#xD;
joy, which the mate answered by waving his&#xD;
tarpaulin, which had stuck to his head through&#xD;
all his dangers.&#xD;
"He will go up- to the pilot's house, and&#xD;
from thence get up to the city," said Henry to&#xD;
those around him. "Were you bound to Bal-&#xD;
timore ?"&#xD;
"No-to Annapolis, sir,". answered the cap-&#xD;
tam. "We were dismastedl about midnight in&#xD;
the gale, and our escape from death has been&#xD;
n'airaculous, with tha nks to your skill and cour-&#xD;

far from being at&#xD;
&#xD;
ease as he heard the roar of the winds -about&#xD;
the Binnacle, and the loud dashing of the&#xD;
waves as they broke over his wharf, and even&#xD;
swelled up to the foundation of his dwelling.&#xD;
He was absent-minded, and so engrossed with&#xD;
his thoughts that when brandy was asked for he&#xD;
would pour out a glass of water, and when a&#xD;
cigar was desired would hand the whiskey bot-&#xD;
tle.' This unusual conduct drew many\eyes&#xD;
upon him, and more than one of his old cus-&#xD;
tomers sympathizingly asked if he were sick.&#xD;
" 0, wax !" ejaculated Johnny, the little&#xD;
cobbler to his fr nd Sammy, the little tailor,&#xD;
"the cap'n looks as if he was in likkor, don't&#xD;
he,'Sammy ?"&#xD;
"0 scissorsW! n't he, tho '? Let's go and&#xD;

Don't ve,tho'!' responded his friend; and&#xD;
the two worthies rising to their feet as wells&#xD;
they could, for they were tolerably blue, it be-&#xD;
ing after nine o'clock, reeled towards the tap.&#xD;
Here one laid a hand on one shoulder of&#xD;
Blouster, and the other a ,hand on the, other&#xD;
shoulder, and both looking him in the face,&#xD;
hiccuped together as follows :&#xD;
" 0, Blou-Blouster, you-shouldn't get drunk !&#xD;
0, Blou-Blouster, you shouldn't get drunk !",&#xD;
At this moment the sweeping rush of the blast&#xD;
made the four corners of the Binnacle shake;&#xD;
and Captain Ned ripped out an oath that made&#xD;
them both start back with consternation and&#xD;
hold their tongues; in which state of silence&#xD;
they resumed their seats and drinking mugs,&#xD;
both of which had the handles broken off, for&#xD;
when by accident Johnny broke his, Sammy&#xD;
smashed his; and they carried theirlove of be-&#xD;
ing like each other so far as to drink sip for sip,&#xD;
and finish their ale with the same last swallow-.&#xD;
The decayed gentleman, also, could not but&#xD;
regard his host with some surprise, as he saw&#xD;
how differently he acted from his wont; but he&#xD;
was too polite to do more than say in a quiet&#xD;
way as he asked for his glass : F&#xD;
" I trust, sir, you are not seriously indis-&#xD;
&#xD;
posed !-&#xD;
" Quite well, sir, but something on my mind,&#xD;

&#xD;
" So it ought, Captain Blouster. It is a ter-&#xD;
rible night to be at sea."&#xD;
" I say, cap'n," said Tim Wivil, shuffling&#xD;
up, "you don't look 'mazin' well, if I may&#xD;
Speak my mind ; sposen you goes o bed and let&#xD;
me keep tap. I'll do it capital, and, honor&#xD;
bright ! I wont likkor till I've got through and&#xD;
doused the glim."&#xD;
Well,-Tim, if you are sober !"&#xD;
" Sober, cap'n,' repeated our friend,straight-&#xD;
ening up and looking Blouster in the eye as&#xD;
straight as he could ; "look at me! Look at&#xD;
me good ? Look me in the eye and see if I'm&#xD;
drunk. Do you see any likkor in my eye,&#xD;
boy ?"&#xD;
"No, but plenty o' water, Tim !"&#xD;
"Water? If there's enny water in 'em, I'm&#xD;
blamed if I know how it got there ; I aint tasted&#xD;
no water, 'cept when it rained in my mouth&#xD;
von night I slept with my mouth opep ahind the&#xD;
boord pile, since then I haint tasted a drop o'&#xD;
water ; and that was three years ago last fourth&#xD;
o' July might. I1ll never forget it.' If you see&#xD;
water in my eyes and didn't put it there, that's&#xD;
proof a man's sober, when his likkor'turns to&#xD;
water and runs out o' his eyes."&#xD;
"Well, Tim, take the tap, and see that you&#xD;
keep sober, if you are now," answered Blous-&#xD;
ter. He then left the tap-room and hastened up&#xD;
stairs to a corner room that by day commanded&#xD;
a view of the bay. He was in no little alarm.&#xD;
He feared that the schooner would be lost, and&#xD;
he had no insurance on her, and he had not the&#xD;
utmost confidence in Nevil's seamanship. He&#xD;
threw up a window. All was pitch dark with-&#xD;
out, and as he listened, the roar of the wind&#xD;
and the waves was terrible to the ear. He&#xD;
could hardly stand by the window.&#xD;
" This is a Cape Horn gale. The schooner&#xD;
.will go ashore whether inside or outside of the&#xD;
SCapes, if Beachampe has not had the sense to&#xD;
make a harbor before the blow came on." -&#xD;
After he had closed the tap he did not go to&#xD;
bed, but was watching and listening to the&#xD;
&#xD;
Itorm till after midnight; its long continuance&#xD;
only increasing his apprehensions. At length&#xD;
when the morning came, and showed him half a&#xD;
&#xD;
83&#xD;
&#xD;
score of small river craft, sloops and bum-boats&#xD;
stranded upon the shore,-he made up his mind&#xD;
that he .should hear no more, or very bad news,&#xD;
of the Dancing Star. During the day, after the&#xD;
blue sky again appeared, he was to be seen upon&#xD;
the top of the house, where was-a little cupola,&#xD;
or lookout, with his ship's spy-glass to his eye,&#xD;
closely examining the bay towards the south-&#xD;
east. The York policeman was the only one&#xD;
of those who beheld him thus engaged who di-&#xD;
vined his object; and this worthy shook his&#xD;
head wisely and mysteriously, if any one by&#xD;
chance happened to remark that one would&#xD;
think old Ned Blouster was expecting a ship in&#xD;
from India, the way he kept on the lookout.&#xD;
About ten o'clock in the forenoon the citizens&#xD;
were not a little moved by a report brought by&#xD;
a fishing boat, that about daylight that morning&#xD;
a large ship had gone ashore about seven miles&#xD;
up the bay on that. part of the coast nearly&#xD;
opposite the old mill-fort. Blouster was now&#xD;
confident that if a ship could not stand out the&#xD;
gale, the Dancing Star must have been lost.&#xD;
"Did you find out the name of the ship ?"&#xD;
he asked of the fisherman who brought the&#xD;
news.&#xD;
" They called her the Genius," answered&#xD;
the man.&#xD;
" The Genius-was it the Genius? are you&#xD;
sure?"&#xD;
"The Geenus or Janus !"&#xD;
"James ! It must have been the James !"&#xD;
he exclaimed, in no little excitement. He now&#xD;
hastened to his lookout, but he could not see&#xD;
the creek, as it was hidden by the shoulder of&#xD;
land on which the old fort stood. About noon&#xD;
another boat came down stating the particulars&#xD;
and bringing the captain of the vessel himself,&#xD;
After Blouster had warned him with his best&#xD;
potations, he took him into that famous little&#xD;
back parlor, and shutting the door, said, for&#xD;
he did not like to appear too intimate before&#xD;
" And you have indeed lost youi- vessel,&#xD;
&#xD;
captain ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Blouster, and nearly lost my life with&#xD;

ter to himself, " he may make a match of it. I&#xD;
will propose it to him and. aid him all in my&#xD;
power. But I fear I shall never see him nor&#xD;
the Dancing Star more I"&#xD;
Leaving the two friends in wrong-doing to talk&#xD;
over their affairs more in detail, and speculate&#xD;
upon the probable chances whether the Dancing&#xD;
Star were likely ever to be heard from again, we&#xD;
will once more place our readers on board this&#xD;
vessel.&#xD;
It will be recollected that we last saw her as&#xD;
the day of the storm  was closing, full twelve&#xD;
miles south of Cape Henry, steering to the south-&#xD;
ward with every stitch of canvass sprearl, flying&#xD;
from before the revenue cutter. At dark and&#xD;
in the prospect of the gale, we saw Henry Main-&#xD;
waring reluctantly give up the chase and stand&#xD;
away northward in order to gain the Chesapeake&#xD;
before the blow should come on. We have wit-&#xD;
nessed the fierce struggle of the little revenue&#xD;
&#xD;
cutter with the tempest, and her ultimate success&#xD;
in gaining the bay towards morning, with the loss&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
86&#xD;
&#xD;
of part of her bulwarks and of one man over-&#xD;
board, the Vidocq of the police. , But the cut.&#xD;
ter, as we have seen, was not outrin the darkness&#xD;
and storm of that appalling night alone.' More&#xD;
than once ad it tacked from one stretch to anoth-&#xD;
er, it saw crossing its bows the phantom-like out-&#xD;
line of another vessel; which on being the se-&#xD;
cond time seen was pronounced by all on board&#xD;
to be the schooner.&#xD;
This opinion was a correct one. It was the&#xD;
fugitive which they had ceased to chase at dark.&#xD;
And no sooner did it become so dark that the&#xD;
cutter could no more be seen astern, than laa-&#xD;
champe gave orders to put about, saying to Las-&#xD;
tels, " We will let Mainwaring run south and&#xD;
chase the caps of the waves till morning for his&#xD;
amusement, while we give him the slip and go&#xD;
back again !&#xD;
But the two vessels had, unknowingly the one&#xD;
to the other,1 tacked at the 'same moment; and&#xD;
unseen by each other, had stood together in the&#xD;
darkness on the same tack. When the storm&#xD;
grew so great that Mainwaring lay to,the schoon-&#xD;
er passed him and then first discovered him.-&#xD;
For miles further on, both vessels being under&#xD;
way, they saw one another again for an instant,&#xD;
crossing on opposite tacks. After seeing the&#xD;
cutter the second time, the lieutenant, said to&#xD;
Beachampe :&#xD;
"  will bet my head it was the cutter."&#xD;
"She can't be here," said he, " unless she&#xD;
tacked when we did, which is probable. We will,&#xD;
however, cheat her. She is lying to, and we&#xD;
can run in to the bay and reach York before she&#xD;
will let out her reefs 1"&#xD;
"If we carry sail this way, we shall reach a&#xD;
hotter place than York," answered the mate-&#xD;
"We plunge under to the windlass~ at every&#xD;
leap."&#xD;
"If can't help it. I shall carry sail so long&#xD;
as she floats. It is neck or nothing. We must&#xD;
either gain the bay or lose all we've gained;-&#xD;
and I would as lief go to the bottom as go ashore&#xD;
without a maravedi in my purse. Let her&#xD;

IN   8 ,                           THE DAN(&#xD;
cordage was drawn as hard as rods of iron.-&#xD;
{ The bowsprit dipped under the waves at every&#xD;
plunge. Suddenly a cry was heard under the&#xD;
bows, and the wave that broke over them lifted&#xD;
upon its briny arms a human form and cast it on&#xD;
board.&#xD;
What was that ?" .cried out Nevil. " Who&#xD;
is overboard'?"&#xD;
i4 "Nobody, but some one has come on board,&#xD;
I believe, sir," answered- one of the men.-&#xD;
"Either Neptune or the devil l"&#xD;
I am neither one nor the other, good friends,"&#xD;
said the man of the sea, making his way aft as&#xD;
well as he could by the light of the battle-lan-&#xD;
tern that hung in the companion way.&#xD;
" Who in the name of Satan, are you, and&#xD;
where di you come from .  demanded Nevil,&#xD;
as a tall man with dripping garments and hair&#xD;
f  stood before him. He had light hair, and was&#xD;
beardless, and therefore could not be Neptune ;&#xD;
and he was not cloven-footed.&#xD;
' " Iam saved by a wonder, sir. Have been&#xD;
washed overboard from a ship in the gale not&#xD;
r  many minutes ago, and was supporting myself&#xD;
as well as I could by swimming, when your&#xD;
schooner's bows dipped ine up as if I had been&#xD;
a fly in the cream-pot dipped up with a spoon.&#xD;
4, It is true I fell on your deck something hard,&#xD;
but I am willing to take a few hard knocks to save&#xD;
t   my life."&#xD;
r    "You are welcome," answered Nevil; " and&#xD;
I wonder at your rescue. What ship were you&#xD;
The-the America, sir, bound to Charles-&#xD;
ton fr om New York,'" answered the man. " I&#xD;
was only a passenger, sir. What vessel is this?"&#xD;
This? Well, it is a revenue vessel. We&#xD;
are bound in."&#xD;
~ Speak louder, if you please, sir ! The wind&#xD;
'Yhowls so, I don't hear ; and besides my ears are&#xD;
&#xD;
as full of water as a bottle of porter ?"&#xD;
It is a revenue cutter, bound to Baltimore !"&#xD;
4     "Very well. I am willing to go to Balti-&#xD;
more.&#xD;
"The deuce he is," said Beachampe to him-&#xD;
41self.   "He will spoil all my plans; for if 1&#xD;
mean to run my goods into York river, Iwant no&#xD;
&#xD;
CING STAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DANCING STAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
spectators. I will land him on the coast, near&#xD;
Elampton."&#xD;
With these reflections, he bade the man go in'&#xD;
to the cabin and stay till he got dry, if he wish-&#xD;
ed. As the wind blew chilly, the stranger&#xD;
availed himself of this permission and disappear-&#xD;
ed down. the companion-stairs, which, however,&#xD;
he descended with difficulty, the schooner danc-&#xD;
ed about so wildly in the gale.&#xD;
" I've heard that voice or one like it, some-&#xD;
where before," said Beachampe to his lieuten-&#xD;
ant; "but I don't think I ever saw the man be-&#xD;
fore. He has made a rare escape .&#xD;
"He is born to be hanged, that you may be&#xD;
sure of," said the gray-haired lieutenant, laugh-&#xD;
ing; " so we ought to be sure he is a rogue,&#xD;
and must keep a sharp eye on him."&#xD;
The clipper now continued for the remainder&#xD;
of the night to battle with the storm ; now lying&#xD;
to when it would have been madness to have run&#xD;
any longer; and now running, when other ves-&#xD;
sels with less desperate captains and more hon-&#xD;
est fortunes, would have laid to. Safely passing&#xD;
the Capes, they steered N. N. W, and kept&#xD;
the Hampton -coast on thg starboard beam, sail-&#xD;
. . "&#xD;
ing as nearly to d as they could, in order to give&#xD;
a wider berth to the western coast, which was a&#xD;
lee shore ; and on which, for not keeping on the&#xD;
wind ward side of the bay, the captain of the&#xD;
James the same night wrecked his ship.&#xD;
The darkness, however, was so great that&#xD;
after standing on for about two hours after&#xD;
doubling Cape Charles, Beachampe resolved to&#xD;
anchor and wait for daylight. This decision,&#xD;
doubtless, saved his vessel from sharing the fate&#xD;
of the merchantman.&#xD;
At daylight he male sail again, but discover-&#xD;
ing that his schooner had. sprung aleak in the&#xD;
hard straying she had undergone, he was com-&#xD;

&#xD;
a portion of the ship's cargo. Blouster, there-.&#xD;
fore, had no one to impart his troubles to.  He&#xD;
was-se'll-humored that his customers did not&#xD;
wait till the usual time to-shut up, and began to&#xD;
go away; and had all left except Wivil by nine&#xD;
O'clock, each much wondering at the moroseness&#xD;
of their usually civil host.  This latter wor-&#xD;
thY, having no sleeping place, and no home,&#xD;
usually hung about the inn to the last moment.&#xD;
But he was now peremptorily ordered to leave&#xD;
by'Blouster, who wanted to go out and inquire,&#xD;
of a sloop that had just passed up to the wharf&#xD;
above, if anything had been seen of the Dane-&#xD;
ing Star. Wivil, however, refused to go, saying&#xD;
he must have a "night cap " todrink before he&#xD;
would go; and besides, as it was. wet out, he&#xD;
begged to be permitted to sleep on the floor of&#xD;
the tap.&#xD;
"I am in no humor to be bothered with you,&#xD;
fellow," answered Blouster. "Get you gone,&#xD;
dog ?"&#xD;
Wivil, however, still whined and begged for&#xD;
the liquor, when Blouster rudely took him by&#xD;
the collar and thrust him forth and shut the&#xD;
door in his face. The poor wretch fell heavily&#xD;
down the steps and rolled into the dock, where&#xD;
he would have drowned, if at that very instant a&#xD;
boat had not appeared and shot in towards the&#xD;
stairs.&#xD;
"It is a man that has fallen in; pull hard,&#xD;
men ;" and the next moment he had him by the&#xD;
jacket, and with the aid of his ' men, lifted him&#xD;
to his feet upon the stairs.&#xD;
"It is Tim Wivil," said one of the men, as&#xD;
soon as Tim shook the water from his head and&#xD;
face.&#xD;
" Yes, gentl'n, it's poor Tim.  He never had&#xD;
so much water in is mouth afore', nor nev-&#xD;
er had so much touch him. I'm werry much&#xD;
obleeged to you, Cap'n Mainwaring. You've&#xD;

" How came you to fall in,. Tim ?"&#xD;
"~ It was that 'fernal Blouster pitched me in !&#xD;

V8:&#xD;
&#xD;
" You can 'peach, can ou, Tim f What de&#xD;
you know ?" asked Mainwaring, in an under&#xD;
tone, struck by the earnestness of Wivil.&#xD;
" Don't I know ? I could hang him !"&#xD;
" You could ! Well Tim, you mustn't stand&#xD;
shivering here. Get in the boat and go aboard&#xD;
the cutter, and you shall have something strong&#xD;
to keep you from taking cold, and a warm bed.'&#xD;
"Shall I ? I aint got drownded for nothin'."&#xD;
The men helped Tim into the boat, and then&#xD;
said Henry :&#xD;
"How is it Blouster has shut up so early ?"&#xD;
"Because he expects smuggled goody, I&#xD;
guess," answered Wivil, almost savagely.&#xD;
"He does, ah? I see, Tim, you do know&#xD;
something. Wait here, my men, a moment, till&#xD;
I return !"&#xD;
He then passed round the inn, and after walk-&#xD;
ing rapidly a few steps westward, he came tc&#xD;
he dwelling of the York policeman, from which&#xD;
two nights before Vidocq had taken his depar-&#xD;
ture. He was at once admitted, when he made&#xD;
known to him,the fate of Vidocq, and also, how&#xD;
that the latter had informed hin that suspicions&#xD;
rested on Blouster in connection with the schoon-&#xD;
er.o The police officer then told him he had&#xD;
placed a spy upon ouster's motions; and gave&#xD;
the name. It was Tim Wivil ; who the York&#xD;
policeman said would be the most suitable, as&#xD;
he would not be suspected; and that he had&#xD;
bribed him largely enough to insure his faithful-"&#xD;
ness. Mainwaring then told him how his spy&#xD;
had been treated, and added:-&#xD;
"My cutter is now in the stream, just above&#xD;
the inn wharf. The schooner, if she is not lost,&#xD;
will be coming this way in a night or two, to&#xD;
land the freight she has robbed the ship of. It&#xD;
is more than likely that Blouster will be the re-&#xD;

was said, wrapped to the chin in a storm coat,.&#xD;
and luxuriously sipping a mug of hot negus to&#xD;
keep him from catching cold after his drowning.&#xD;
" I heerd the capting tell bout it ; and the lady'&#xD;
is Miss Kate Beachampe, the cousin of this&#xD;
preshus Nevil Devilchampe !"&#xD;
"Can it be possible !" exclaimed Henry,&#xD;
with surprise.&#xD;
"I now see the resemblance in her profile,"&#xD;
said Elliot.  " I knew that it was familiar. It&#xD;
is her likeness to him."&#xD;
"I trust she is nothing like him," said Hen-&#xD;
ry, with emphasis.&#xD;
" I will answer for that; for she seems to be,&#xD;
all patience and gentleness. She smiles in all&#xD;
her suffering when Alice or Margaret do her any&#xD;
little service, and thanks them so sweetly. Yet&#xD;
she is not able to move a limb."&#xD;
"Sad ! sad ! She is the heiress of the noble&#xD;
estate. .It is a pity she should not inherit it.&#xD;
If she should die it would fall to Nevil as the&#xD;
next heir." '&#xD;
" If bedis not hanged first."&#xD;
&#xD;
lay beam on against it.&#xD;
" There is no doubt now  of the quality of&#xD;
our friend there," said Mainwaring. " It is&#xD;

hesitated to have added a new crime to his many&#xD;
deeds of evil, by taking her life."&#xD;
"Yes, as she alone stands in his way to the&#xD;
estate."&#xD;
"Captain Mainwaring, there was a light just&#xD;
shown on the top of the Binnacle, and then re-&#xD;
moved, and then raised again, and then put&#xD;
out," reported the officer of the deck.&#xD;
Henry and his friend were instantly on deck.&#xD;
The light re-appeared as they were watching.&#xD;
and became stationary.&#xD;
"Look on all sides, men, and see if there is&#xD;
an answering light anywhere, up river or down,&#xD;
on land or water."&#xD;
I see a light twinkling like a star down the&#xD;
river," said Elliot.&#xD;
"I see it," answered Henry, with animation ;&#xD;
and he directed his glass towards it. " It is from&#xD;
the deck of a vessel.' I can makeout her dark&#xD;
hull -just outlined in the surrounding gloom.&#xD;
The light has disappeared. Now keep watch&#xD;
some of you on the policeman's house. The&#xD;
crisis is coming. That vessel is coming in. I&#xD;
can see the masts and canvass loom up. It is a&#xD;
small vessel. I believe on my soul it is the&#xD;
schooner.  Put out all lights in our cabin. We&#xD;
must not be seen.  The lumber sloops at anchor&#xD;
between us and the coming vessel will help to&#xD;
conceal who we are, if this should be our man."&#xD;
The vessel which had shown the answering&#xD;
light now drew nearer, coming stealing up the ,&#xD;
stream, till it was easy, without the aid of the&#xD;
glass for persons accustomed, like sailors, to use&#xD;
their eyes in the night, to make her out to be a&#xD;
clipper built schooner, under her fore and main-&#xD;
sail and single jib. She at length reached as&#xD;
high us up the old wharf opposite the Biropacle,&#xD;
when she put her helm up, and brailing up her&#xD;
sails to check her headway, as well as to conceal&#xD;
herself better, she ran strait into the wharf and&#xD;

" Not yet, sir .?"&#xD;
"Yet the man must be on the alert."&#xD;
liHe was on the alert. He had stationed his&#xD;
men, secretly, and had himself watched the&#xD;
movements of Blouster, whom he saw moving&#xD;
his dark form, densely seen in the night, about&#xD;
in the lookout on the top of his tavern.  He&#xD;
saw him show the- light,; and he saw the light&#xD;
answered down the river.  He saw the vessel&#xD;
reach the wharf, and Blouster pass within two&#xD;
feet of hissseeret hiding-place and shake hands&#xD;
with Beachampe on the wharf. He saw    the&#xD;
men proceed to unload, and carry the packages&#xD;
and bales on their shoulders, singly, or by twos,&#xD;
or by fours, according to their weight, and enter&#xD;
a low door beneath the inn, and depositing them&#xD;
there, return for more.  He thought it was now&#xD;
time for him to make the signal agreed upon ;&#xD;
and hastening to his house close by, he hurried&#xD;
to the roof with a lantern.&#xD;
" Light ho! I see the signal!" shouted the&#xD;
lookout at the cutter's mast head.&#xD;

but we must take them. alive or dead.  Now to&#xD;
your oars.  Softly.  Elliot, you command one&#xD;
of the boats. I will head.- You board at the&#xD;
bows while I carry her on the quarter."&#xD;
Two boats were now filled with men, eight in&#xD;
eash, armed to the teeth and ready for fighting&#xD;
twice their number. Henry gave orders to his&#xD;
lieutenant, who had five men left with him, to&#xD;
slip~ the cable if he heard firing, and run down&#xD;
to within hail.&#xD;
" Now, let fall without noise, an give way&#xD;
&#xD;
her signal; and in a, few moments the boats met&#xD;
-her under full canvass coming down the river,.&#xD;
&#xD;
At this very instant Blouster, who was talk-&#xD;
ing with Beachampe on the deck of the Danc-&#xD;
ing Star, while the men were, taking out the&#xD;
freight received from the James; saw the lantern&#xD;
which was swinging to and fro i  the hands of&#xD;
the policeman out of his garret windows. He&#xD;
pointed it out to Nevil, and said :&#xD;
" That means mischief. It is from the house&#xD;
of the chief of police. YQu are discovered, I&#xD;
fear."&#xD;
"There are not ten packages to go ashore&#xD;
yet !"&#xD;
"A   spy-a spy !" cried Lastels, collaring,&#xD;
one of the under policemen, whom he discovered&#xD;
within an old sugar hogshead.  Blouster ran to&#xD;
see, and recognizing him, was about to take hold&#xD;
of him to imprison him on board the schooner,&#xD;
so that he might not give the alarm, when the&#xD;
man fired his pistol to defend himself, and&#xD;
broke from them and fled.&#xD;
" It is all up now! This will raise the whole&#xD;
town," sOd Blouster, coolly, pressing his 'hand&#xD;
on his side to stop the blood of a wound he had&#xD;
received from the bullet.  "Call your men.&#xD;
You must land the balance some other time."&#xD;
". All on board. Every man on board,"&#xD;
cried Beachampe.  "Cast off and bear off.&#xD;
Lively, men, all !"&#xD;
In a moment the crew were on board, and&#xD;
the sails spread and sheeted home, and the&#xD;
schooner under steerage way with her stern&#xD;
rounding away from the wharf. It was at this&#xD;
moment the two boats full of men came in sight.&#xD;
"Give way hard and strong, men. They have&#xD;
seen us and are escaping," cried Mainwaring,&#xD;
standing up in his boat, and waving his cutlass&#xD;
in his eagerness.&#xD;
" We had best give chase in the cutter,"&#xD;
said Elliot. "'She will outsail us in the -boats.&#xD;
She has got headway on now to distance us."&#xD;
" You are right."&#xD;
He then discharged a couple of pistAs as a&#xD;
*signal for the cutter to slip her cable and bear&#xD;
down' This she had already done, taking the&#xD;
pistol fired by the police officer on the wharf as&#xD;
&#xD;
all," he whispered, scarcely above his breath&#xD;
The two boats left the cutter's side simulta&#xD;
neouslyan d pulled noiselessly towards the wharf&#xD;
&#xD;
92&#xD;
&#xD;
south-east, and this kept him too close to the&#xD;
wind for speed ; and he also saw the cutter haul-&#xD;
ing her wind to cut him off to windward.  He&#xD;
therefore resolved to square away and run wing&#xD;
and wing, his best point for sailing, strait up the&#xD;
&#xD;
"r      -&#xD;
r$     a"&#xD;

F&#xD;

THE DANCE&#xD;
They've given us the slip !" exclaimed&#xD;
Henry, as he leaped on board ; but we will not&#xD;
let her escape. Hoist up the boats, and then to&#xD;
quarters, men. We must take her or sink our&#xD;
own craft. Ho, there, ont he wharf!" he hail-&#xD;
ed as he passed; "is the chief of the police&#xD;
there ?"&#xD;
" Yes ; with Ned Blouster a prisoner, and&#xD;
wounded."&#xD;
"The schooner is Beachampe's vessel ?"&#xD;
"Yes; and he landed a score of boxes and&#xD;
bales."&#xD;
"That's enough-all I want to know. His&#xD;
race is up this night. Take possession of the&#xD;
inn, and I shall bring you more guests besides&#xD;
its host for you to entertain in it," answered&#xD;
Henry.&#xD;
The Dancing Star was by this time standing&#xD;
strait out towards the bay, about a third of a&#xD;
-mile ahead of the revenue cutter, which was in&#xD;
plain sight by the light of the low and newly&#xD;
set moon astern. Beachampe was in great ex-&#xD;
citement. He urged his men to crowd sail with&#xD;
the most terrible oaths. He cursed himself for&#xD;
having run into a trap, when he was invited to&#xD;
enter the river by the light Blouster displayed.&#xD;
But Blouster was ignorant of the presence of&#xD;
the revenue cutter in the river, as she had pass-&#xD;
ed up far across and taken her anchorage out of&#xD;
sight of his inn. He paced the deck, cursing&#xD;
not only himself, but Blouster and his own ill-&#xD;
fortune; and as he saw the cutter more than&#xD;
holding her own, and trying to cut him off from,&#xD;
going south down the bay, he began to feel that&#xD;
his chances of escape were very few. Having&#xD;
crowded all sail on that he could, he now order-&#xD;
ed his men to their quarters, and swore to them&#xD;
that it was his intention to die fighting rather&#xD;
than be taken.&#xD;
As he reached the mouth of the river he tried&#xD;
to steer south, but as the wind came from the-'&#xD;
south-west, he could not .lay his course south-&#xD;
&#xD;
was distinctly heard to crash through the bul-&#xD;
warks. The smuggler no sooner received this&#xD;
shot than he put his helm up and ran stretching&#xD;
&#xD;
bay. He gave orders accordingly, and flinging&#xD;
broad to the stern wind his fore and main tacks,&#xD;
he commenced a regular flight. His courage,&#xD;
his previously expressed desire to meet Henry&#xD;
Mainwaring, his rival in Alice Beaufort's love,&#xD;
in deadly combat, seemed now to forsake him in&#xD;
the imminent and present danger to which he&#xD;
found himself exposed.&#xD;
" If he takes wings in this style, he will es-&#xD;
cape us," said Henry, observing the new ma-&#xD;
noeuvre of the schooner ; and he gave orders&#xD;
to bring the heaviest piece of ordnance he had&#xD;
on board forward to bear upon her.&#xD;
"Fire !" he cried.&#xD;
The cutter recoiled, and the roar of -the ex-&#xD;
plosion seemed redoubled from the stillness that&#xD;
preceded it. The flash lighted up the waves&#xD;
and were reflected like red lightning from the&#xD;
canvass of the Dancing Star.&#xD;
' It did not hit her ! She keeps on! There&#xD;
she answers !" cried the young commander, as a&#xD;
tongue of flame was darted out from the schoon-&#xD;
er's side, and thrust back again like the tongue&#xD;
of a fiery serpent. A sharp report was follow-&#xD;
ed by the rushing of a shot above their heads.&#xD;
"The game is fairly begun," said Elliot.&#xD;
"Now I pray that we may soon be winners."&#xD;
"'Keep her away and gain the offing of her,"&#xD;
said Henry to his helmsman.  "We must crowd&#xD;
her in shore ; so if she should outsril us,i we&#xD;
can shorten  her track.  Is the gun again&#xD;
loaded ?"&#xD;
"Double-shotted, sir !"&#xD;
"Very good. I will sight the gun this time&#xD;
and see if we can cripple her. There she fires&#xD;
again.''&#xD;
" He means to fight, that is plain," said&#xD;
Elliot.&#xD;
The shot from the schooner struck the fore-&#xD;
mast about ten feet above the deck and buried&#xD;
itself in it. The cutter still kept eating her&#xD;
way to windward of the clipper schooner, until&#xD;
a gun could be brought to bear on her weather-&#xD;
quarter. Henry then fired, and the iron missile&#xD;

4  the water strait up the inlet in the dire&#xD;
the old mill. Every five minutes Bea&#xD;
would fire a stern gun at his pursuer in&#xD;
of crippling him. And this was always&#xD;
ed by a shot from the bow gun of the cu&#xD;
"If I can't cripple his masts," said N&#xD;
he discharged his. piece for the eighth time&#xD;
;z shall have to ru  the schooner ashore&#xD;

e when&#xD;
n, if he&#xD;
&#xD;
could have wished to be on deck, it would have&#xD;
been impossible to quit the cabin, as he tested&#xD;
to 'his own satisfaction; for Nevil had locked&#xD;
him in to prevent the possibility of his going on&#xD;
shore and reporting the character of his vessel.&#xD;
But little did he imagine that he was locking up&#xD;
so safely the very policeman-Vidocq-whom&#xD;
he had so much' reason to fear and detest.&#xD;
When finding himself washed overboard from&#xD;
the cutter, Vidocq believed that it was all up&#xD;
with him ; but being a good swimmer, and hav-&#xD;
ing so often escaped death from. drowning, he&#xD;
hoped that something might turn up in his favor.&#xD;
Every wave broke over him and washed off his&#xD;
black wig, wilted his false whiskers, and made&#xD;
his dark complexion fair as nature intended it&#xD;
should be. At length, when he was about to&#xD;
make up his mind to become food for the fishes&#xD;
of the sea, he saw near him, and bounding di-&#xD;
rectly towards him, the clipper schooner, which,&#xD;
before he was aware, scooped hin up with the&#xD;
wave on which'be rode, and larded him safely&#xD;
on her forecastle.&#xD;
In, order to preserve himself free from possi-&#xD;
ble recognition and not to be put ashore till the&#xD;
vessel had got where he could call aid, Vidocq&#xD;
pretended illness.  But when he would have&#xD;
quitted the cabin at York, to call for the aid of&#xD;
the" police, he found himself a prisoner. He,&#xD;
however, proceeded to cut his way out through&#xD;
the bars across the cabin windows, when he felt&#xD;
'the schooner in - motion, and found that they&#xD;
were flying before the cutter.' His position was&#xD;
now by no means an enviable one ; and he hoped-&#xD;
that he would be rewarded for his danger from&#xD;
the "shots of the pursuing vessel, by seeing her&#xD;
capture the smuggler. As he had no arms of&#xD;
his own, and as he had been loaned a thick deck&#xD;
coat to wear, he took a pair of loaded pistols&#xD;
from the rack and placed them in the pockets,&#xD;
and prepared to avail himself of the, first turn of&#xD;
fortune in his favor. The companion-way had&#xD;
been unlocked after the schooner commenced&#xD;
running, and he could go on deck if he' saw fit.;&#xD;
but for the present he resolved to remain in the&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
da&#xD;
&#xD;
cabin and play the invalid ; especially as he&#xD;
could see all the manoeuvres of the revenue&#xD;
cutter from the stern windows.&#xD;
&#xD;
The cutter gained every minute upon the&#xD;
chase, and when within about half a mile of the&#xD;
landing at the mill, a shot from the former&#xD;
knocked the foremast out of her. It fell, topsail&#xD;
and all, over the lashed sides ; but was soon cut&#xD;
away, and every effort with the aid of sweeps&#xD;
was made by Beachampe to get away from Main-&#xD;
waring. Ie urged his men to superhuman&#xD;
efforts; but all was futile ; a second successful&#xD;
shot took the head of the mainmast off, and the&#xD;
schooner broached to and laid a helpless wreck&#xD;
on the water within cable's length of the shore.&#xD;
To our boats all !" shouted Beachampe.&#xD;
The men threw themselves into the two boats,&#xD;
and Vidocq, who was resolved not to leave the&#xD;
side of his man again, jumped in with them.&#xD;
They cleared the wreck of the schooner, which&#xD;
they had no time to set on fire, just as the cut-&#xD;
ter ranged up alongside and prepared to'board.&#xD;
"Follow me !" cried Mainwaring, who in the&#xD;
darkness had not seen the boats depart.&#xD;
" Follow, my brave , fellows !' exclaimed&#xD;
Elliot, as both leaped on the deck of the schoon-&#xD;
er at the same moment at the head of boarding&#xD;
parties. But three wounded men and one corpse&#xD;
were found upon it.&#xD;
" There they go ! Boats ! Man our boats !"'&#xD;
shouted the disappointed commander of the rev-&#xD;
enue cutter, as he pointed with his cutlass to the&#xD;
retiring boats crowded with the fugitives pulling&#xD;
for the land.&#xD;
"In a few moments the cutter's boats were in&#xD;
full pursuit, and, gaining every instant, reached&#xD;
the landing at the same instant with the smug-&#xD;
gling party. Both crews sprang on the shore&#xD;
from their boats at the same moment, and Bea-&#xD;
chamnpe and his men, instead of flying to the&#xD;
ridge and woods, had to" stand their ground to&#xD;
defend themselves. The contest was for a few&#xD;
moments of the most sanguinary character.&#xD;
Several were severely wounded on both sides.&#xD;
Beachampe and Lastels, attacked by Mainwaring&#xD;
and Elliot, fought with groat courage. Ibastels&#xD;
was struck down by Elliot, who disarmed him ;&#xD;
Henry, after twice wounding Beachampe, com-&#xD;
&#xD;
polled him to yield his cutlass and take h's life&#xD;
at his hands, though he haughtily refused t beg&#xD;
for it.&#xD;
&#xD;
"You may kill me, Henry Mainwaring. I&#xD;
will not own a life one hour that I begged of&#xD;
tliee !"&#xD;
"Kill him not, captain," said Vidocq, now&#xD;
making himself known.   "lHe is my prize, by&#xD;
the arm of the law "&#xD;
" Vidocq!" exclaimed Henry, as if he had&#xD;
encountered a ghost.&#xD;
"Yes. I was picked up by the clipper, and&#xD;
they have brought me to land again.&#xD;
When Bea champe understood who it was that&#xD;
now laid claim to his person, and whom his ves-&#xD;
sel's bows had picked up, he, ground his teeth'&#xD;
and uttered a curse deep and ferocious. But&#xD;
he was too weak from  loss of blood to resist.&#xD;
Vidocq, therefore, placed, with professional&#xD;
skil , a pair of iron manacles on his wrists.&#xD;
Two thirds of the smuggler's men were also&#xD;
capt red, and the rest, favored by the darkness,&#xD;
for t ie moon had been set for half an hour, es-&#xD;
cap d to the woods on the ridge in the rear of&#xD;
th mill.&#xD;
Sleger, the miller, was not a little amazed at&#xD;
seeing two schooners, pursuing and pursued,&#xD;
coming up the inlet and firing into each other:&#xD;
and he went out to watch the result, wondering&#xD;
what it all could mean. He now drew nigh,&#xD;
when being recognized by Elliot, he was briefly&#xD;
told what had happened. The wounded men&#xD;
of both sides were taken on board the schooner,&#xD;
which now was secured to the landing place;&#xD;
and the surgeon had his hands full until day-&#xD;
break. Beachampe was borne to the miller's.&#xD;
house and there had his wounds dressed ; and&#xD;
one of them in the chest the surgeon pronounced&#xD;
mortal.  Sleger's house now had the aspect of&#xD;
an hospital- In the rear room lay poor Kate&#xD;
Beachampe, who tile surgeon said could not&#xD;
survive the injuries she had received among the&#xD;
waves. Near her was the executor of Colonel&#xD;
B~eachampe's ,estates, Mr. McNeil, who was&#xD;
pronounced out of danger. In the front room&#xD;
lay Nevil Beachampe, suffering greatly from his&#xD;
wounds, and conscious of all that passed around&#xD;
&#xD;
him.   Near him sat Vidocq, with an expression&#xD;
o! professional triumph on his face. He had&#xD;
succeeded, and his reputation as chief of the&#xD;
police had received its crowning star.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
The pall of death.  The Will of the dying&#xD;
girl.  The wretched Nevil conscience strick&#xD;
en in death. An angel of comfort.    The&#xD;
repentant "man, bequeathing all to Alice,,&#xD;
expires.  Our tale brought to a close.&#xD;
'     HE morning sun shone brightly through&#xD;
the small panes of the mill house window&#xD;
and lighted up. with golden gloiy the counte-&#xD;
nance of the lovely English girl, Kate Bea-&#xD;
ehampe. Her face was pale as the marble, and&#xD;
her large fine eyes lit up With unearthly bril.&#xD;
liancy. A group was gathered about her bed.&#xD;
Nearest to her, kneeling by her pillow, her face'&#xD;
bathed in tears, was the gentle Alice Beaufort,&#xD;
who mourned that one so young and fair, and&#xD;
born to wealth and honor, should die so young.&#xD;
On the other side of the bed, bending over her&#xD;
and bathing her forehead and hair with Eau de&#xD;
Cologne, stood Margarat St. Leger, beautiful asI&#xD;
either of these, yet with a striking contrast. It&#xD;
was the beauty of the falcon compared with that&#xD;
of the dove.S&#xD;
At the foot of the bed stood, with folded&#xD;
arms, the tall, manly form of the miller.  He&#xD;
was gazing sadly upon the young stranger, who,&#xD;
the surgeon had 'warned, would not live many&#xD;
hours, nay, -was , dying even now, though she&#xD;
had her voice clear and intellect unclouded.&#xD;
Elliot kneeled by the side of Alice.&#xD;
A door opened.  The dying girl raised her&#xD;
eyes :&#xD;
"Has he come ?" she said, softly.&#xD;
It is Henry," said Alice, gently.&#xD;
"Tell him to come hither."&#xD;
Henry Mainwaring drew near, and Elliot&#xD;
rising, gave him his place by Alice. . She then&#xD;
cast her eyes towards a settee on which sat Mr.&#xD;
McNeil, regarding her with profound grief.&#xD;
"Sir,"she said tohim,"IJwish ou tobear&#xD;
witness that what I say is my will. I am about&#xD;
to go where the gold and silver of earth are&#xD;
valueless. .I have heard during the watches of&#xD;
&#xD;
the night, from good, noble Margaret here, the2&#xD;
simple story of the attachment of her brother,&#xD;
who saved me at the peril of his life. She also&#xD;
&#xD;
made known to me the betrothment of the gentle&#xD;
Alice, who has been like a sister to me, to this&#xD;
noble gentleman; and when I asked her why&#xD;
she was not married, she "blushingly told me&#xD;
that it was 'the pride of the lover who would&#xD;
wait to be rich. I, therefore, in testimony of&#xD;
my regard for, band gratitude to, Elliot Beaufort,&#xD;
bequeath to h-m one half of my estate, to be&#xD;
divided e uall between him and Margaret St.&#xD;
Leger, on condition that they marry within one&#xD;
moth afer my death; and I, appoint you,&#xD;
Colonel McNeil, to see that my wishes in this&#xD;
respect be 'faithfully carried out. With, regard&#xD;
to the other, I-     -&#xD;
Here she ceased speaking. The mother of&#xD;
Alice, who had been peering in at the door,&#xD;
now rushed forward and said eagerly-" Raise&#xD;
her up and she will live long enough to say&#xD;
what she will do with the other half, for it must&#xD;
have been to my Alice."&#xD;
No one heeded the woman. Restoratives&#xD;
were applied, but the maiden spoke no more.&#xD;
She ceased to breathe, and her bright spirit took&#xD;
its flight to realms of joy, to which the doors of&#xD;
the dark tomb are the only entrance.&#xD;
For several minutes all was silence. The&#xD;
awe of death weighed on every mind.    Mad&#xD;
Bess at length approached the pure corpse and&#xD;
reverently made the sign of the cross upon the&#xD;
for head, and Alice crossed the fair hands one&#xD;
6ver the other upon'the still wargi bosom. Mar-&#xD;
garet burst into tears and wept over her as if&#xD;
she had lost a sister. Large glittering globes&#xD;
rolled down the cheeks of the stout miller.&#xD;
But we close the curtain upon this scene, to&#xD;
present another.&#xD;
In the adjoining room, with no one by his side&#xD;
but Vidocq, lay Nevil Beachamnpe, while his&#xD;
cousin was dying. He had been told who she&#xD;
was and 'that she was dying ; but he could not,&#xD;
move. The least motion, his surgeon said,&#xD;
would bring on hemorrhage and produce imme~-&#xD;
diate death. He, therefore, lay and-listendd&#xD;
when all had gone into the other room. "He&#xD;
listened with a strange desire to imagine how&#xD;

V&#xD;
up.&#xD;
&#xD;
him through the dark portals, aroused a morbid&#xD;
curiosity\ in his soul, and he listened as if&#xD;
he expected some echo to reach' him from the&#xD;
world unknown of how the departing spirit had,&#xD;
found it.&#xD;
"Do you think she is dead yet?" he asked&#xD;
of the officer, whom he was too prostrated t,&#xD;
fear or hate, or care about, one way or the other..&#xD;
But Vidocq kept his place by his bed side ; and&#xD;
although at Elliot's request he had removed the&#xD;
manacles from his hands, he did not intermit&#xD;
the' closest vigilance. He was evidently annoy-&#xD;
ed at the precarious condition of his prisoner,&#xD;
and in his heart prayed that he might just live&#xD;
long enough to be hanged.&#xD;
"Do you think she is dead yet?" he_ asked,&#xD;
rolling his bloodshot and glaring eyes towards&#xD;
his keeper, and then directing them to the door.&#xD;
".No-1 hear them talking.",&#xD;
"And it is my cousin. She will die and I&#xD;
shall be heir ! 0, for life and health !" he&#xD;
groaned.&#xD;
"You had best keep quiet if you want to&#xD;
live," answered Vidocq, in nervous anxiety for&#xD;
fear he should hasten his end.&#xD;
Live!   Yes, if she dies I want to live ! II&#xD;
shall be rich ! I feel no pain now. I don't&#xD;
believe it will go so hard with me as the&#xD;
doctor-"&#xD;
"Hist !  She isAdead now !"&#xD;
" Dead ?" he repeated.&#xD;
"Yes.   That is the silence of death in that&#xD;
room. She's gone !"&#xD;
Toney now came into the room on tiptoe and&#xD;
said in a solemn way :c&#xD;
4' Dead, sir -r"&#xD;
" Yes, I knew it ."&#xD;
"Did she die easy?" asked Beachampe. g&#xD;
Does death seem to be hard ?"h&#xD;
"She died like gwine to sleep, massa." i&#xD;
"I am glad to hear one may die easy !' ~&#xD;
Here he groaned heavily. " Ah, I fear me, 1 I1&#xD;
shall die hard." .he muttered. "0O, my crimes~~~&#xD;
&#xD;
my guilt seems to have a thousand eyes to gaze'I&#xD;
at me! .  am heir of Beachampe now, but i I&#xD;
shall~ inherit only the grave and worms !". J&#xD;
&#xD;
97&#xD;
&#xD;
"You seem greatly- troubled," said the&#xD;
officer.&#xD;
At this moment entered a gray-haired lawyer,&#xD;
who had been sent for in the lugger to come to&#xD;
make the will of Miss Beachampe at her request.&#xD;
But he was too late. He was shown- into the&#xD;
room by Tony. In the meanwhile Nevil Bea-&#xD;
champe began to suffer the tortures of conscience.&#xD;
He repeatedly groaned and buried his face in&#xD;
his hands, but always replied he suffered no&#xD;
pain of the body. The surgeon soon cane -in,&#xD;
and after feeling of his pulse, pronounced mor-&#xD;
tification to have taken place. He received this&#xD;
announcement with 'a shriek of terror; for up to&#xD;
this moment he had a secret hope that he might&#xD;
recover. For some minutes he remained with&#xD;
his hands covering his face and moaning deeply.&#xD;
A group stood around' him  gazing on him with&#xD;
surprise, curiosity and pity. He had no man's&#xD;
sympathy. He was merely a spectacle of curi-&#xD;
osity and horror.- He began to writhe. He&#xD;
uttered curses, and maligned the Almighty&#xD;
that he should be taken out of life now that he&#xD;
had become rich. These raving continued with&#xD;
more or less strength for half an hour. Then&#xD;
he became calmer. He lay a long time perfect-&#xD;
ly silent, with the eager Vidocq watching at his&#xD;
bed's head, as if in his zeal he were prepared to&#xD;
arrest the very spirit inits escape from the body.&#xD;
"I can't die !-'I am too great a criminal to&#xD;
die !  I have wronged so many ! Ilhave done-&#xD;
so much evil! Doctor ! 0, if you can by any&#xD;
force or power of art prolong my life, even for&#xD;
a week, that I may have space to repent, I will&#xD;
give thee half of my fortune ! I am now heir&#xD;
of Beachanipe."&#xD;
" Save half," answered Colonel McNeil, who&#xD;
was leaning on the arm of the lawyer and re-&#xD;
~arding him. " Thy cousin has bequeathed the&#xD;
ialf to Elliot Beaufort."&#xD;
" The half ? Ah, well, be it so ! The half&#xD;
will do for a man who will be dead in an hour.&#xD;
see by thy silence, doctor, there is no hope for&#xD;
meo. Send me a priest ! Let him pray for me !&#xD;
s there none ! Who will pray for me ? I feel&#xD;
&#xD;
am dying ! I never experienced such a strange&#xD;
mortal coldness about my heart ! I know it is&#xD;

Kate Beachampe, when -,she was seen to sign&#xD;
