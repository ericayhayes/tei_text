OMMUNIPAW!I low, flat, with scarce a tree to relief&#xD;
its monotonous aspect, girt by Bait-marsh and salt-&#xD;
water, what wonder that the bold adventurers of the&#xD;
Goede Vrouw chose it as the spot most congenial to&#xD;
Batavian hearts when they first cast anchor in its muddy&#xD;
cove ! The place has changed but little since its early&#xD;
days; ;a sleepy-canal winds lazily through the meadows,&#xD;
the old stone houses~ are shouldered by more pretentious&#xD;
wooden cottages, but a primitive air of drowsiness and&#xD;
solidity it still retains, and with a windmill or two we&#xD;
could well fancy ourselves on the shores of the Zuyder&#xD;
Zee.&#xD;
In 'the month, of September some twenty and odd&#xD;
years ago, on one of those still, warm, mellow days be--&#xD;
tween summer and autumn, when nature, having yielded&#xD;
her -abundance, abandons herself to indolence and re-&#xD;
pose, a very plain equipage was wheeling along the&#xD;

&#xD;
road that led from Paulus Hook tp this ancient village&#xD;
of fishermen and market-gardener~. Arrived at the as-&#xD;
cent of Bergen Heights the coachman turned into a&#xD;
narrow cart-road that branched off to the left, and while&#xD;
he is pursuing his way we will take a bird's-eye view&#xD;
from the heights of the surrounding country. We are&#xD;
now on the ridge which extends northward into the&#xD;
Palisades of the Hudson, and below us are the roofs of&#xD;
Jersey City built on a wide flat, which was at some re-&#xD;
mote period subnierged, as is evident from the quantity&#xD;
of exuvhe collected at' the base of the heights. Away&#xD;
across the Hudson we behold the spires and warehouses&#xD;
of the great City hedged by ship-masts and spars like a&#xD;
grove of leafless hickories; while behind us, the land-&#xD;
scap~ slopes down to a vast expanse of marsh, through&#xD;
which in i~he distance meanders the Jiackensack. The&#xD;
dreary aspect of this marsh is relieved by Snake Hill, a&#xD;
thickly ~ooded eminence, rising island-like out of the&#xD;
~vapors tl~at cling around its b~e and creep over the sin'-&#xD;
face of flags and sedges. Turning towards the south,&#xD;
we see thick cluster of houses fronting New York&#xD;
bay. Some of them are the old stone dwellings of the&#xD;
- original! settlers, and others are white wooden cottages&#xD;
built a ong the water-side and inhabited by fishermen.&#xD;
* The share, white with crushed oyster-shells, is embank.&#xD;
ed here for about a quarter-mile to arrest the encroach-&#xD;
ing sea, which is gradually devouring the land, and&#xD;
alread$r, in a fresh nor'-easter, dashes its spray merrily&#xD;
against Vhe windQw panes of the houses. There is a&#xD;
flotilla of fishing boats bobbing at the end of a little&#xD;
jetty; stakes parking off oyster beds; fykes and gill&#xD;
nets drying on the beach; more of those long clinker&#xD;
&#xD;
built boats bottom up, more nets, oars, and stacks of&#xD;
shad-poles in the little gardens; with here and there a&#xD;
killock, a block, an old skiff, or some such prize of flot-&#xD;
sam as a spar or broken caboose-and all this comprises&#xD;
the famed vilrage of Communipaw, parent of the great&#xD;
city on Manhattan Island, and eldest born settlement o~&#xD;
the Dutch colony of Pavonia.~&#xD;
By this time the carriage has left the Bergen road,&#xD;
and is proceeding adown Communipaw lane, During&#xD;
the ride along the meadows, the occupant of the vehicle,&#xD;
a lady, was busily employed in whisking away with her&#xD;
handkerchief the mosquitoes that attacked her head and&#xD;
hands. Annoyed beyond endurance by the pertina-&#xD;
cious insects she raised the glasses; and thus boxcd&#xD;
continued her ride until the coachman pulledeep to in-&#xD;
quire of a wayfarer where one Jacob Van Horn lived.&#xD;
The wayfarer replied by asking which "Jake Van&#xD;
Horn" was meant, "Mill-Kill Jake" or "Cap'n-&#xD;
Jake ?"&#xD;
The coachnian, puzzled, turned to his mistress, when&#xD;
that lady, dropping the window, said, "The one that&#xD;
married Miss Vreeland."&#xD;
"They both on 'em married Miss Vreelands," re-&#xD;
turned the questioned man.&#xD;
"The one I want to find," said the lady, "has blue&#xD;
eyes~. and ~rather large feet."&#xD;
"Both got blue eyes-can't say zackly 'bout the feet.&#xD;
Anyhow, Mill-Kill Jake lives close by in that 'ere house,&#xD;
and it won't put you out much to stop there and ask."&#xD;
The coachman drove as directed, and iji a few mo.&#xD;
ment~ they had arrived at a capacious farm-house that&#xD;
lay at the meet of a creek with the waters of Communi-&#xD;

GARRET VAN HORN.&#xD;
&#xD;
paw Cove. Here dwelt Jacob Van Horn,' or, "Mill.&#xD;
Kill Jake," as he was commonlyy called, to distinguish&#xD;
1dm from other Jacob Van Horns of the neighborhood.&#xD;
The dwelling was an old one, built of rough grey stone,&#xD;
with prQjecting eaves, a small porch, and ornamented&#xD;
around the windows and at the coigns with red brick.&#xD;
Alongside, towards the creek, stood five overshadowing&#xD;
elms, giants and patriarchs among the trees of' Commu-&#xD;
uipaw and South Bergen, while to the eastward lay the&#xD;
waters of the cove that circled in from Kill Van Kull to&#xD;
Paulus Hook.&#xD;
"This is the place, Dennis, ][ know," said the lady, as&#xD;
her coachman assisted her to alight; "I recollect it now&#xD;
by the box-trees."&#xD;
They crossed the simple and neglected garden, made&#xD;
up of rows of venerable box of enormous girth, holIy~&#xD;
hocks, some fragrant quince trees, and a grape vine,&#xD;
witlibut meeting any one, and after several ineffectual&#xD;
knocks at the front door, set about seeking the ocon-&#xD;
pants~ At the rear of the house was an open door&#xD;
leading into the kitchen, entering which they found a&#xD;
grey-headed negro peeling potatoes.&#xD;
"Richmond !" cried the lady. "'Where's Mr. Van&#xD;
Horn?"&#xD;
"Gone fissiii-.-gone fissin," said the old man in a&#xD;
hoarse, impatient whisper, and without raising his eyes&#xD;
from his work.&#xD;
"When will he return, Richmond ?"&#xD;
"Dunno-dunno-.---doWt bodder-~---got to git dem&#xD;
taters riddy gin dinner-time-gin dinner-time."&#xD;
Finding it useless to question the churlish old man&#xD;
further, the lady and her domestic walked to a knoll&#xD;
&#xD;
GARRET VAN HORN.&#xD;
&#xD;
9&#xD;
&#xD;
hard-by, from the summit of which they discovered a&#xD;
boat containing a man and two boys slowly gliding in-&#xD;
shQre. The boat was soon hitched to a stake in the&#xD;
creek, and the man, laden with baskets, waded ashore,&#xD;
followed by the taller boy bearing the other on his back.&#xD;
The man, who was none other than the sought-for&#xD;
Jacob, was well advanced in years, as his thin hair and&#xD;
furrowed face sufficiently attested; but the level of his&#xD;
broad back and the firm tread of his' long limbs' denoted&#xD;
yet considerable vigor. He wore a low-crQwn napless&#xD;
beaver, a double-breasted cloth vest buttoned to his&#xD;
throat, and a pair of patched trousers of dingy blue, a&#xD;
style of dress adopted by him, and but little varied,&#xD;
Sunday or week-days, since the time he 'sported a&#xD;
queue and knee-breeches.&#xD;
As he approached and recognized the lady he ex-&#xD;
claimed, "Well, den, Jane, dat's you, II believe! How's&#xD;
do old man, Garret? Getting' pretty well 'long, eli?&#xD;
Well now, oat's pleasant for to see 'you here. Walk&#xD;
'long in de house dere, walk in."&#xD;
"Jacob, I've come to see about these ~boys. That's&#xD;
Garry, aint it? My eye-sight's so poor," said the lady,&#xD;
who was old Jacob's sister-in-law, pointing with her&#xD;
gloved finger at the lads, who remained sheepishly back,&#xD;
staring with curiosity at the lady and her servant.&#xD;
"Yes-yes----come here, Garry-come, Myndert.&#xD;
Dem's 'em. Good for nottin rogues d~y be too-can't do&#xD;
nottin wid 'em. When I was dere age, you see, I was&#xD;
obleeged to am my livin'. So it was wid your old man,&#xD;
Garret; ask him, he kin tell you. But den, you see,&#xD;
had more head nor what I got, so he got 'long better.&#xD;

time as dese vagabonds do. 1 wish I was well red on&#xD;
'em. I tink some of sending' on 'em to sea. All dem&#xD;
boys do, all day long, nottin but sailing boats-sailin&#xD;
boats. I never did see two sich lazy scamps as dem two&#xD;
bees. Ef I ask 'eni for to hoe a little, or to milk do&#xD;
cow a little, or to do any odder little ting, it's nottin&#xD;
but grumble-grumble-grumble. But dey'll go fishin,&#xD;
fast enough. Always 'ready for dat. But work-dat&#xD;
don't agree wid ?em, no how."&#xD;
"They all say Carry looks like my husband. Come&#xD;
here, child-can't say il s a very striking likeness-per-&#xD;
haps, though, it's the snn~buin," said the lady, approach-&#xD;
ing the younger lad.&#xD;
"Garry's putty bright boy, I'll say dat for him, b~it&#xD;
he aint over strong, not sense he got de inflammation&#xD;
on his chist. Old Doctor Zabriskie, he tells me ~s how&#xD;
we must' be keerful on him, but I tinks getting' stronger&#xD;
nor he was," said the old man in a tone of solicitude&#xD;
that contrasted with his habitual gruffness.&#xD;
"Do you remember the talk I had with you, Jacob,&#xD;
the last time you were at our house, about my taking&#xD;
Garry with Ub ?"&#xD;
"Well.-~yes," answered Jacob Van Horn, with a&#xD;
little hesitation. "But come in do house and set down&#xD;
and rist yourself a bit. We kin talk 'bout dat after-&#xD;
wards,-time enough," and he led the way into the best&#xD;
room, threw open the window shutters, and dusted a&#xD;
chair for the accommodation of the lady, and another&#xD;
for her servant.&#xD;
"Why don't you have a door-mat ?" asked the lady.&#xD;
"It's easy to see you've no woman about the house,&#xD;
everything's so untidy. Never mind," added she, ob.&#xD;
&#xD;
serving his intention of asking ~'h0 coachman to enter,&#xD;
"Dennis can stay by the horses. SAnd now, Jacob, how&#xD;
~'have you been since I last saw you? You look older, I&#xD;
think, though perhaps it's not being shaved. Xow let's&#xD;
talk about the boys. You know we want to adopt&#xD;
Garry; so, are you ready ?"&#xD;
"Well-den-I know de boy wouldn't suit you. lie&#xD;
aint actually wort his salt, dat boy aint. You couldn't&#xD;
do noting wid him. Todder dayl set him 'flout banking'&#xD;
salary and I hadn't morn turn my back round when I&#xD;
seed him off in dat boat of Myndert's,-.why, he's getting&#xD;
worse nor Myndert is."&#xD;
"He seems quiet enough too-come in, Garry, come&#xD;
here. How old are you? There-~--take your fingers out&#xD;
of your mouth, child. He don't appear any way vicious&#xD;
as far as I can see."&#xD;
"You don't know nottin 'bout him. Boys is so deceiving.&#xD;
WejI, to be sure he aiht so very vicious, but den you see ~&#xD;
you'd be ~sorry ef you was to take him. You couldn't&#xD;
do nottin wid him. I tell you dat beforehand."&#xD;
"Do you think tjie other-what's his name-Myn-&#xD;
dert, aint it?' Do you think he'd suit us better? as I'd&#xD;
as lief take him as his brother-though Garry's named&#xD;
after his uncle, and perhaps Mr.Van Horn might prefer&#xD;
him on that account."&#xD;
"Well, no," answered old Jacob with a shake of the&#xD;
head, "it's 'bout six tq one and half.dozen to toddler.&#xD;

tink o' dat ?"&#xD;
"Dreadful, I'm sure. Th4,. Jacob, you don't seem ins&#xD;
dined to let me have either of t1~m," said Mrs. Van&#xD;
Horn. "Now I came' to propose that they be sent to&#xD;
8ome good boarding school, away from here, and learn&#xD;
ciphering, and manners, and geography, and such like.&#xD;
For you are~r~~ing these children up like heathen, and&#xD;
then "-&#xD;
"Oh, well now, dey's got dedication enough. Jist as&#xD;
mi~ch larnin as ever I got ~r your old man, and jist see&#xD;
how he. got 'long. Too much larnin isn't good for boys&#xD;
'cept dey be' goin to be doctors or dominies. It makes&#xD;
dem too proud to work, and ashamed of dere parents.&#xD;
Dere was old Cornelis VaiPiierzee, as lived down by&#xD;
Quacknick, as sent his boy, John, down to Princeton to&#xD;
go tro' college. We]l, what good did it do? Why, when&#xD;
he came home you couldn't get him to do a bit of work&#xD;
'round de farm. All he would do all day long, was&#xD;
nottin but wear g6old chains and smoke cigars, and now&#xD;
Quacknick and de old house aint good 'nough for him,&#xD;
and he must go and live to York. Now, jist look at de&#xD;
money and expense trownaway to bring up a chap like&#xD;
dat."&#xD;
"As far as that goes, Jacob, I don't want to put you&#xD;
to much expense. Let me see-they'll want new books,&#xD;
and-anyway it wont cost a great deal, and we'll pay for&#xD;
Garry's schooling if you decide upon letting us have&#xD;
hin."&#xD;
&#xD;
The old man revolved the proposal in his mind for&#xD;
some moments, and then spoke, "how much you tinks&#xD;
it 'ill cost for Nyndert? lie wouldn't want to stay very&#xD;
long, anyhow, and I always likes to know 'fore I makes&#xD;
a bargain, how it's a goin~ to stand. Ef he was dera&#xD;
tree months, now, I should tink~ he ought to take in a&#xD;
mighty sight o' larnin."&#xD;
"Oh, that would be too short a time, Jacob; but then&#xD;
we could decide about that afterwards. If we should&#xD;
adopt Garry, why, of course he'd have to have a differ~&#xD;
ent sort of education and manners from what he's learnt&#xD;
here. You wouldn't, of course, expect him to enter hi~&#xD;
uncle's office and be a merchant in this kind of a way.&#xD;
Now, wouldn't you be pleased to have us adopt hifti and&#xD;
bring him up as our own son?"&#xD;
"Well-I dunno-4 dunno," said the old man dubi~&#xD;
ously.&#xD;
~' Pshaw V you said a while ago you wished you were&#xD;
rid of them both."&#xD;
"Well, I know, I tinks so now and den; for dey do&#xD;
ennye me so at times. IDey 'ye been spilled, dem boys&#xD;
is. Why, when dat Garry dere .was tree year old, you&#xD;
couldn't git him to eat quince sweetmeats widout you&#xD;
put sugar on 'em."&#xD;
"I should hope he'd outgrown such nonsense by this&#xD;
time, and besides it's bad for the teeth. But, Jacob&#xD;
Van Horn, I shant stay and argue with you any longer~&#xD;
Make up your mind at once. Do you intend to let me&#xD;
have one of them or not ?"&#xD;
~i' Well den, Jane, I'll jist tell you how 'tis. You see&#xD;

" How are they off for clothing ? They don't look very&#xD;
gay -just now, and, any way, they'll want new things&#xD;
to go to school. Let me see, Jacob, what they've got."&#xD;
" Oh, dey've got a plenty of good warm close; better&#xD;
close nor what I or your old man had when we was&#xD;
boys. Dem times, you know, we wore de knee-breeches&#xD;
and buckles, and had our hair all done up in a long&#xD;
queue behind.. When dat .went out o' fashion, I' kep&#xD;
dat long queue o' mine some time. I tinks I must have&#xD;
it stowed away somewhere yit;" said old Jacob, as he&#xD;
.led the way np-stairs to the sleeping rooms., e&#xD;
Mrs. Van Horn pulled out the drawers of an old&#xD;
clothes-press, and examined tho boys' scant wardrobe&#xD;
with the critical eye of a housewife. -"And is this all,&#xD;
Jacob? Dear me!I what a shocking condition they're&#xD;
in. They want at least half-a-dozen shirts apiece- -&#xD;
stockings-dear-.dear l there's no time to lose. We&#xD;
must have new ones made up right away. I had better&#xD;
take them over with me and have their measures taken,&#xD;
and linen mnide up at once.", -&#xD;
" I guess we'd better tink over the matter agin. It&#xD;
wont do, Jane, to he in too much of~a hurry 'bout dis.&#xD;
Spose we put it off till de beginnin' o' winter. I may want&#xD;
dem lboys to help 'round and git in a little salt hay 'fore&#xD;
long."&#xD;
"You've had plenty of time to think it over since we&#xD;
&#xD;
IL&#xD;
&#xD;
first spoke about it, and here I've omie all the way, and&#xD;
most bitten to pieces by those mosquitoes, and now you&#xD;
must decide at once, for I shjant come over again, I can&#xD;
tell you. Thursday week, is the beginning of a new&#xD;
quarter at Mr. Crumbie's school, and I want them to be&#xD;
there at the commencement."&#xD;
" Well, den, have your own way 'bout dis, Jane-&#xD;
have your own way. Only, I tinks it's trowin' away a&#xD;
good deal o' money for nottin on dem rascals."&#xD;
So Mrs. Van~ Horn carried her point, and took the&#xD;
boys off with her to procure their outfits. On their way&#xD;
to the city she made many good-natured inquiries of her&#xD;
nephews, for a pleasant little woman was Aunt Jane,&#xD;
very talkative and brisk, and with a constant endeavor&#xD;
to appear stylish, in which attempt she did not succeed&#xD;
in the least.&#xD;
As the las had never seen the interior of any dwell-&#xD;
ings other thin those of their native village, they were&#xD;
somewhat w~e-struck at the seeming magnificence of&#xD;
their uncle's residence. Aunt Jane left them in the&#xD;
parlor staring in open-eyed surprise at the surrounding&#xD;
marvels. The room, however, was not a gorgeous nor&#xD;
even a cheerful one; on the contrary, thick dark cur-&#xD;
tains excluded the sun-light, the mantels were of black&#xD;
marble, the furniture, carpets, and walls of a studied&#xD;
sombre hue, all of which was certainly not calculated&#xD;
to excite frivolous emotions or raise drooping spirits.&#xD;
Towards evening, an elderly gentleman, gold-speeta-&#xD;
cled, black-dressed, and smooth-shaven, arrived.&#xD;
" This is your uncle, boys," said Mrs. Van Horn.&#xD;
" Ah-ah," said the uncle in a prompt way, " and&#xD;

"The small one," said Mrs. Van Horn; "he's the&#xD;
smartest, too."&#xD;
"Ah-ah---he looks like me, does he ?" said the&#xD;
uncle, casting a scrutinizing look at his likeness over his&#xD;
spectacles. "And how do you do, sir ?"&#xD;
"I'm well," answered the little fellow, hardly daring&#xD;
to raise his eyes to th&amp;amp; august personage who addressed&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"I'm well, sir, thank you-you should say," said Mrs.&#xD;
Van Horn.&#xD;
"I'm well, sir, thank you," repeated the boy.&#xD;
"The other boy is named-what ~" inquired Mr.&#xD;
Van Horn.&#xD;
"Myndert," replied his wife.&#xD;
"Ah, Myndert-that was his grandfather's name,&#xD;
Well, I hope, boys, you will both grow up to be respec-&#xD;
* table men and good citizens. Ah-um-Mrs. Van Horn,&#xD;
* I suppose~ we had better go down to tea."&#xD;
Aunt Jane .was many year~ yoringer than her hus-&#xD;
band, for she was barely, thirty or so, while he was full&#xD;
fifty. This may have accounted for their different dis-&#xD;
positions, for he was as grave and undemonstrative as&#xD;
she was cordial and lively.&#xD;
The next morning the boys returned to Communipaw&#xD;
to take leave of their father, but the old man had, on re-&#xD;
flection, and after consultation with his companion, the&#xD;
negro Richmond, repented of his acquiescence in his&#xD;
sister-in-Jaw's plan, and now opposed his children's de~&#xD;
pasture. Whereupon, Aunt Jane was obliged to call&#xD;
in old Jacob's sisters, Mrs. Brinekerhoff and Mrs. Van&#xD;
Reypen, to her assistance. These ~two ladies, kind-&#xD;
hearted souls, ba~&amp;amp;for a long time been much disturbed&#xD;
&#xD;
in mind by their brother Jacob's worldly course of life,&#xD;
and by the pernicious example be presented to hi~&#xD;
children; they, therefore, gladly exerted all their influ-&#xD;
ence to induce him to 4ccept Mrs. Van Horn's generous&#xD;
offer to exercise a naat~rnal protectorate over the youth&#xD;
and adopt one of them as her own son. Old Jacob,&#xD;
though seconded by the aged negro in his opposition,&#xD;
could not resist this camarilla, and after a short contest&#xD;
was forced to succumb and yield a reluctant assent to&#xD;
the departure of his children from home.&#xD;
When, finally, Mrs. Van Horn's carriage came to take&#xD;
the boys away to school, old Jacob was much affected,&#xD;
and unable to repress his emotion; while Richmond, the&#xD;
black servant, shuffled about in a very uneasy way, as&#xD;
if he had received a severe knock on the pate, and&#xD;
shook his grey mop stubbornly, muttering to himself,&#xD;
"No use-no use torkin' Miss Van Horn-+[ tell ye&#xD;
can't go-can't go Miss Van Horn.?~&#xD;
And now, as this separation from home proved the&#xD;
spring and shaping of the two boys, Myndert and Garret&#xD;
Van Horn's future lives, I, Garret, the junior brother&#xD;
and chronicler of the family, take it as the starting-point&#xD;
in this my veritable history, and beg to introduce my-&#xD;
self to the reader's acquaintance. flut, before ~4-&#xD;

SOME ACCOUNT O1~' TflE VAJ ~ noni~r FAMILY,&#xD;
IT   cliiied to agree with Mr. Tennyson, that                K&#xD;
ow~v~u democratic we may be, however well in-&#xD;
"The grand old gardener and his wife&#xD;
Smile at the claims of long descent,"&#xD;
yet it is gratifying to reflect that one~s ancestors were&#xD;
neither hangmen nor thieves, and we feel a secret plea-&#xD;
sure, nonsensical if you will, in being able to number&#xD;
among our forefathers one illustrious or noble person-&#xD;
age. Let me confess I share this prevalent weakness,&#xD;
and that in my younger days it ,was food for ii~y'vanity,&#xD;
and still is, perhaps, some satisfaction, to know that&#xD;
good blood and true runs through my veins. Show me&#xD;
nobler stock than those stout old burghers of Ghent&#xD;
and Haarlem, those obstinate brewers and weavers,&#xD;
that indomitable peasantry of the Z&amp;amp;aland marshes who&#xD;
&#xD;
fought the sea inch by inch, or those hardy sailors who&#xD;
swept the Channel and humbled the meteor flag in its&#xD;
own waters. What vividly tinted pictures does their&#xD;
history present of patriotic struggles, internecine strifes,&#xD;
wars and devastation, shifting to eras of learning, opu-&#xD;
lence, and tranquillity. I love to dwell on the heroic&#xD;
deeds of old Holland's sons, of that frugal, honesty&#xD;
thrifty race; and while perusing the pages that teem&#xD;
with the recital of their valor, their constancy, and their&#xD;
love of liberty, my heart swells with the thought that&#xD;
the blood of thos~ stubborn freemen, mayhap of that&#xD;
unfortunate Count, or of the intrepid pilot William, or&#xD;
of that fierce water-rat who bit the Spaniard's heart in&#xD;
twain and spat it out as t~oo bitter, may be leaping in&#xD;
my pulses.&#xD;
But my brother Myndert laughs at all this, and de-&#xD;
clares that we Americans have no ancestors, and that&#xD;
our women should wear golden grasshoppers in their&#xD;
hair, for, like the ancient Athenians, we spring from the&#xD;
earth. So, leaving conjecture aside, let me simply state&#xD;
that my grandfather Myndert, son of Peter Van I-Torn&#xD;
and Mary Van Voorst his wife, married Miss Petronella&#xD;
Marcellus, a lady of Ilugucuot extraction, by whom he&#xD;
had issue three sow au~ ~ ~ wo daughters. At his death&#xD;
his farm ~yas divided among the children, and t~e home-&#xD;
stead fell to my father's share. The youngest son, Cor-&#xD;
nelius, being rather wild and free-handed, soon squan~&#xD;
dered his portion of the patrimony, and then entered&#xD;
the navy, where he became boatswain's.mate. I can but&#xD;
just i~emeinber him, a hairy giant all over India-ink&#xD;
anchors, eagles, and stars, who gave Myndert; and ilie&#xD;
a bright dollar apiece, and took me on his knee while&#xD;

&#xD;
he sang to us "Perry's Victory." We never saw&#xD;
him afterwards, for he was lost in the sloop-of-war&#xD;
Hornet, foundered in the Gulf of Mexico during a&#xD;
cyclone.&#xD;
The second son, Garret, inspired with more ambition,&#xD;
went to the city of New York, entered the counting-&#xD;
room of Abraham Depeyster as errand-boy, and gra-&#xD;
dually attained, by a faithful observance of the rules of&#xD;
commercial success, a partnership in that opulent h use,&#xD;
and subsequcAtly a large fortune. Jacob, n~iy ther,&#xD;
married a Miss Vreeland, from which union s rang my&#xD;
brother Myndert and inyself~ We lost our mother&#xD;
when I was about five years old, and thus sufl'2rod all&#xD;
the neglect consequent upon the deprivation of mater-&#xD;
nal care and solicitude. Then our father's household&#xD;
consisted only of his two childi~n and the aged negro&#xD;
Richmond, 'w1ho had formerly been a slave in the family,&#xD;
Richmond, served as cook ahd chambermaid, besides&#xD;
lending a helping hand at the vegetable culture; but all&#xD;
'his pride lay in his culinary talent, *~or, immediately&#xD;
after his manumission, having, to try his new-found&#xD;
wings, made, several sea-voyages as cook and steward,&#xD;
he had learnt the art of concocting various vile messes&#xD;
known as "sea-pies," "lobseouses," etc~ that seemed to&#xD;
my innocent boyish palate savory enough, but which I&#xD;
now shudder to recall. Richmond had bee~i also in his&#xD;
vigorous years no mean pugilist, and the "Dutch nig.&#xD;
ger" was wellkuown and dreaded about Bear market and&#xD;
the slips of New York as a formidable bruiser. After his&#xD;
seafaring days he obtained employment on board the&#xD;
periaguas plying between the Jersey shore and the&#xD;
city, until, succumbing to age and the rheumatism, he&#xD;
&#xD;
r~turne~ to our house, where he found a haven for the&#xD;
remainder of his days. He came originally from Vir-&#xD;
ginia, where my grandfather Myndert had purchased&#xD;
him, and as he had often carried about my uncles and&#xD;
aunts when children he imagined himself an integral&#xD;
portion of the family, and thereby privileged to rail at&#xD;
~and scold the Van Horns all and singular. And, so&#xD;
thoroughly did he avail himself of this immunity that in&#xD;
his old age hewas continually grumbling and growling,&#xD;
day in and day out. Whether engaged in tilling the&#xD;
garden or about the kitchen, in raking oysters, or in&#xD;
any other work, he kept up a running accompaniment' of&#xD;
garrulous snarls and threatening. And so rooted had&#xD;
the habit become that for want of an object he would&#xD;
hold grumbling soliloquies by the hour. Although this&#xD;
particularity made him about as companionable a body&#xD;
as a neuralgia bear, yet he and father remained in con-&#xD;
stant good fellowship, probably because the latter was&#xD;
also given to a similar practice, and thus, between tjiem,&#xD;
they managed to keep up a lively spirit of discontent&#xD;
with the universe and all its appurtenances. It was&#xD;
all bark and no bites, however, and we boys were not&#xD;
only unmindful of the beatings of father and Richmond,&#xD;
but on the whole rather relished them as spicing the&#xD;
dull routine of existence.&#xD;
And so we throve like little Indians, wild, untutored,&#xD;
and uncouth. I, Garret, was a slim alert boy with dark&#xD;
hair and eyes, and a skin i~rown as a chestnut; and father&#xD;
would say~ that all the French blood that my grand.&#xD;
mother Petronella Marcellus haa brought into the&#xD;
family must have concentrated in me, for no Van.iHorn&#xD;
ever had so much black about him.&#xD;

GARRET VAN HORN.&#xD;
&#xD;
* Myndert, on the contrary, was fair, had blue-grey eyes&#xD;
and light hair, not pretty featured by any m~ans, but&#xD;
stalwart and tall, with a square open forehead, slim&#xD;
American jaw, long legs, and the striding gait of all&#xD;
Dutch colonists from the Cape of Good Hope to Paulus&#xD;
Hook; for, instead of being the fat dumpy race the&#xD;
popular fallacy *ould have us, we of Dutch descent are&#xD;
mostly above the average stature; indeed, at the Cape,&#xD;
the Boors easily o'ertop the Englanders, who certainly&#xD;
are not undersized men. Myndert, too, though he looked&#xD;
stolid, and as if it took some time for an idea to reach&#xD;
his brain, was of an ingenious turn of mind, and spent&#xD;
many hours at the smith's and the carpenter's until he&#xD;
had learnt much of their crafts. ~He had constructed,&#xD;
without other instruction than that picked up in occa-&#xD;
sional visits to the boat-builders, a fine cat-rigged sail-&#xD;
boat, fifteen feet long. The materh~ls he bought~with&#xD;
money earned by gathering chestnuts for market, and&#xD;
supplying the apothecaries with calamus-root dug from&#xD;
the swamps. Father was much gratified at the evi.&#xD;
dences of his son's mechanical skill, and though he took&#xD;
pains to conceal his satisfaction, betrayed it by pur-&#xD;
chasing the canvas and cordage, as our father never&#xD;
expended money for things not absolutely necessary&#xD;
without some strong incentive. Likely enough, though,&#xD;
he repented of his indulgence, for the "Gallinipper"&#xD;
proved so swift a craft that my brother and I spent&#xD;
nearly all our time in sailing about the harbor ~nd racing&#xD;
with the Whitehall boats, much to the neglect of the&#xD;
Van Horn vegetables. Once, as we were dancing gaily&#xD;
past Robbins' reef, a gust of wind struck our sail and&#xD;
capsized the boat. We were both excellent swimmers&#xD;
&#xD;
nd yndert soon gained a perch on the uplifted keel,&#xD;
but no Garret was to be seen, for, on going over, the&#xD;
boom bad struck me a stunning blow on the head. As&#xD;
a white face bobbed up to the surface for the last time,&#xD;
Myndert darted in like a fish, clutched me, and with a few&#xD;
strong strokes bore me back to the boat insensible. The&#xD;
ligl~t-house keeper, who saw the accident, came to our&#xD;
assistance, and I was brought to the lighthouse, hung&#xD;
up by the heels, rolled on a barrel, rubbed dry, and&#xD;
branded to restoration. In spite of this warning we&#xD;
were out again the next day, skimming the billows as&#xD;
fearlessly as a nautiks. In verity, I was amphibious&#xD;
at that age, always either on 6r in the water, sailing,&#xD;
fishing, or swimming, and my love for that element was&#xD;
such as to lead me in a-bathing as early as March. This&#xD;
was at that period of boy-life when we hold the Diluvian&#xD;
era as one replete with aquatic delights, and see in&#xD;
Arctic voyages but the splendid opportunities of skating&#xD;
and sleighing. What we regret most in our advanced&#xD;
years is the decay of those keen, fresh sensations with&#xD;
which we enjoyed muscular play before our addiction to&#xD;
razors. Can music, pictures, or books afford an equiva-&#xD;
lent for that ebullient joy our youthful hearts felt in&#xD;
skating, or in cleaving the limpid waters with free un-&#xD;
trammelled limbs? Are not the pleasures of the table,&#xD;
the mild delirium of tobacco, chess, dancing, billiards,&#xD;
horses, insipid in comparison? Skating! "To chase&#xD;
the flying hours with frozen feet," how I enjoyed it! I&#xD;
could skate and roll like a Frisian. In severe weather&#xD;
the~ bay was frozen hard as iron, and then would we sally&#xD;
forth, eager as hounds, to wheel and glide and skim&#xD;
over the congealed deep like so many swallows. How&#xD;

the swift steel rattled over the granite ice speeding u~&#xD;
miles onward! and the return, to plough our way&#xD;
sturdily back in the teeth of a bitter nor'-wester and&#xD;
come home panting like chased harts, blood boiling,&#xD;
faces flaming, all a-glow and hot save where the com-&#xD;
pressed toes ached with cold! No wonder a happy&#xD;
boyhood is always remembered and regretted. I.pictui'e&#xD;
to myself that little quiet unobtrusive, spot where my&#xD;
early youth was spent; the bedroom that faced the&#xD;
east, and from which I daily beheld the picturesqne&#xD;
panorama of the harbor, with the hills of Staten Island&#xD;
rose-tinted at morn, then framed in. clear transpare~it&#xD;
blue, and again~ enveloped in the purple haze of even-&#xD;
ing; or at sultry summer noon-tide, when the sea. shim-'&#xD;
mered beneath the glaring sun and the white batteries&#xD;
of Ellis's Island shone like a miniature Malta!&#xD;
A vivid recollection have I of the execution of two&#xD;
pirates on Gibbet Island. The surrounding water was&#xD;
closely dotted with boats lull of spectators, and when&#xD;
the signal gun was fired, up rose two night-capped&#xD;
bodies 'dangling in the air! A gale came on that very&#xD;
night, and when I lay in bed the water surged up so&#xD;
angrily, and . the wind moaned so mournfully, that I&#xD;
could not sleep, and aifrightened, left Myndert and&#xD;
crej~t into my father's bed. I was very young at the&#xD;
time of that horrible occurrence, but the spectacle has&#xD;
not been in the least effaced from my memory4&#xD;
It must be avowed, in passing, that my father was&#xD;
considered by his pious relatives as being but little&#xD;
short of a heathen, for he seldom went to church and fre-&#xD;
quently violated the second Commandment in a shock.&#xD;

big way; but for all that, he and old Dominic Van&#xD;
Winkle were close friends, and there was no more wel-&#xD;
comc visitor at our house than the kind and venerable&#xD;
clergyman. On such an occasion, the two old men&#xD;
would enjoy their pipes on the 'porch bench and hold a&#xD;
quiet confab in their well-beloved mother Dutch, when&#xD;
father would promise to return the Dominie's visit, at&#xD;
meeting the next Sunday, a ~promise he never failed to&#xD;
perform.&#xD;
As some amends for his lack of devotion and neglect&#xD;
of the exercises of religion, father always improved any&#xD;
opportunity to inculcate in his children a love of' truth,&#xD;
honesty, and economy, and a hatred of deceit and villany.&#xD;
"When you gits as old as I be, boys, you'll know de&#xD;
world better. Ef you larns by 'sperience, it 'ill cost&#xD;
you something , and all you can learn widout experience ,&#xD;
why, dat's so much made. Oh, what tricks dem sharp-&#xD;
ers be up to! and what ways dey has o' running de mo-&#xD;

Once, he took my brother and me to see the races at&#xD;
the Beacon course, and to enlighten us on some of the&#xD;
practices and temptations of this wicked world. "The&#xD;
Dominie, he says~ boys, dat forewarned be forearmed,&#xD;
and dat i~ really so."&#xD;
The track ~vas some three or four miles north of our&#xD;
village, towards Seacaucus, and so father, Nyndert, and&#xD;
I trudged off to see the sport; father explaining to&#xD;
Myndert the method of the races, and denouncing the&#xD;
attendant evils of gambling and drunkenness, while I ran&#xD;
on ahead, snapping a whip-lash and whipping off mullein&#xD;
heads, and big bumble-bce~ from thistle blooms. We&#xD;
stopped at a friend's house, whose lands adjoined the&#xD;

course, and by getting on the roof of an outhouse we&#xD;
obtained a goQd view of the race. Around the track&#xD;
was a high board fence thickly bedaubed along its upper&#xD;
edge with tar, which, kept viscid by a hot sun, was in-&#xD;
tended as limed twigs f~r impudent boys who should&#xD;
attempt to scale the inclosure. In addition, there were&#xD;
men stationed inside at certain distances as coast-guards,&#xD;
and between these and the fellows in the overlooking&#xD;
tree-tops occurred many unambiguous passages-at-&#xD;
tongues, where elegance was entirely sacrificed to force&#xD;
of expression. In particular was I amused by a large&#xD;
fat man in a white hat among the constables, who, it&#xD;
seemed, had at some period of his life purloined an ass,&#xD;
for one mischievous urchin was constantly shouting,&#xD;
"Who stole the donkey ?" and another would reply,&#xD;
"The man in the white hat !" which so enraged the fht&#xD;
man that he made many perspiring efforts to belabor&#xD;
the younkers, who, fortunately for them, were be'rond&#xD;
his truncheon's length. Then were we diverted by the&#xD;
race, which was a contest between the famous trotting&#xD;
mare Ringdove, and a celebrated pacer. The mare&#xD;
proved decidedly the better one. Around and around&#xD;
the track she glided as smoothly as a rabbit, and when&#xD;
the gallant animal came ~n at the last heat, spinning the&#xD;
de1ica~e wheels of the ~u ky into indistinct disks, there&#xD;
arose a cheer like the sea-roar from the dense multitude&#xD;
on the stands, for the mare was a great favorite and&#xD;
unrivalled on the trotting turf.&#xD;
The sport ended, we left our friend to return home,&#xD;
and while dodging our way through the vehicles throng-&#xD;
ed about the entrance to the course, we noticed ~i thim-&#xD;
ble-rigger at. work.&#xD;

"Dere, boys," said father, "dere's one of dena rascally&#xD;
thieving gamblers dat I told you 'bout. Come wici mc and&#xD;
I'll show you how d6y cheats folks, so dat you'll know&#xD;
'nough to keep away from dem when you meets 'em.&#xD;
See dere, now, he's trying for to git sdme one fool&#xD;
'nough to bet wid him." We approached the man, a&#xD;
sallow, 'tufted-chin chap, who, standing with his kn~e&#xD;
propped up by a cane, was moving three little ebony&#xD;
cups over his leg, and crying: "Bet any man five, ten,&#xD;
fifteen, or fifty dollars can't tell under which cup little&#xD;
joker lays! Now you see, and now you don't see him!&#xD;
If you don't bet you can't win !" and he exhibited a&#xD;
handful of gold coin as a sample of what might, or&#xD;
might not, be won in case you better. "Come, sir,"&#xD;
he continued, addressing father, "I've w6n and lost a&#xD;
great deal of money at this little game, and I'll bet you,&#xD;
sir, any amount o' money, from 'five to fifty dollars, you&#xD;
can't tell under which of them crc cups little joker is."&#xD;
"No-no---," said father, with a knowing laugh,,&#xD;
"can't come dat, neighbor, I'm too old a bird for dem&#xD;
tricks. Dey won't do for old foxes as ~ be."&#xD;
"You're right," chimed in a bystander, apparently a&#xD;
drover, with a jolly good-humored face. "That game's&#xD;
too st~ic, he'd better make tracks-can't make nothing'&#xD;
round these diggins. We knows too much for him."&#xD;
The thimble-rigger dated a look of wrath at the&#xD;
man, and repeated his challenge 1~ the crowd around&#xD;
him. As he turned his head aide for a moment, the&#xD;
drover~ slily raised the cups and brushed away the&#xD;
pea without the gambler's noticing him, and~ then said,&#xD;
contemptuously, "Don't believe you've got any little&#xD;

&#xD;
The gambler continued his cry without~bestowing any&#xD;
attention to the other's remark.&#xD;
"Haw-haw 1" laughed the drover, jeei~ingly, "that's&#xD;
a safe game to play. It's all win with you, mister,&#xD;
and no lose."&#xD;
The gambler turned angrily to him.. "What do you&#xD;
mean by that ?"&#xD;
"Mean what I say. Don't believe you've got any&#xD;
joker under any of 'em."&#xD;
"Perhaps you'd like to bet on' that ?" asked the&#xD;
gambler.&#xD;
"I'll lay anything on it," replied the drover.&#xD;
"Well, for the fun o' the thing, I'll bet you fifty&#xD;
ddlLars it's under one of 'em, come&#xD;
"I hain't got' fifty, but I'll bet you twenty."&#xD;
"Nothing short of fifty. Don't know as I ought to&#xD;
bet any way, it's hardly fair. I know I put it there, but&#xD;
if you're fool enough to bet agin it, I'll go fifty."&#xD;
"Tell you ain't got fifty, but I'll go you twenty, and&#xD;
mind, I'm to raise the cups myself," said the drover, and&#xD;
turning to father with a wink, he whispered, "you put&#xD;
up thirty and we'll have him snug."&#xD;
Father, who chuckled in~~ardly at the prospect of&#xD;
seeing the biter bit, could not resist the additional&#xD;
temptation of gathering 'thirty dollars. "I ain't got&#xD;
but fifteen wid me, but I'll put up dis watch dat's wort&#xD;
thirty more dollars, agin do rest. Dat'll be more'n&#xD;
square."&#xD;
"Well, I guess that'll do. Put tip the stakes in that&#xD;
man's hands. Now we're all right. Go it !" exclaimed&#xD;
tl~e thimble-rigger~&#xD;
"Here she goes !" said the drover, raising the first cup.&#xD;
&#xD;
Nothing. He raised the second. Sure enough, there&#xD;
was the little j~,ker!&#xD;
"I'll take them stakes, if you please," said the gain-&#xD;
bIer, "1 told you you'd lose.~'&#xD;
The look of discomfiture in my father's face as the&#xD;
crowd. raised a shout of derisive laughter I can never&#xD;
forget. He hurried away as fast as po~sible. The jolly&#xD;
drover, who had appeared staggered at the result, re-&#xD;
mained, as I saw on looking back, in amicable, converse&#xD;
with the thimble-man. We walked along in silence,&#xD;
Myndert and I not quite understanding how it came to&#xD;
pass that father,' whom we thought as ~vise as Solomon,&#xD;
could have been thus cozened by the sharpers. Sud-&#xD;
denly he said, "Boys, you see I did a foolish ting and&#xD;
got sarveci right for it. had no business to bet and try&#xD;
for to win any man's money. No man's got a right to&#xD;
money he don't fairly am by honest work. I won't be-&#xD;
grudge de money of it 'ill only be a warning' to ye,&#xD;
dough fifteen dollars and de watch is a good deal to&#xD;
Lose," and he repeated, with a shake of his head, "fifteen&#xD;
dollars and do watch." He never alluded to this little&#xD;
adventure again; though I'm sure he long regretted&#xD;
the loss, for the Van horns, with but few exceptions,&#xD;
arc inclined to parsimony and cling to dollars with&#xD;
great tenacity. This weakness in father, however, i~ever&#xD;
extended 'to penuriousness or uncharitablen ~s for, on&#xD;
the contrary, a kinder-hearted man or a more tr ly gene-&#xD;
rous one to suffering humanity never existed. Don't I&#xD;
still hear old Julia Snow's voice, when father would dump&#xD;
a sleigh-load of fire-wood or a barrel of flour before&#xD;
her door on a' winter's morning; don't I hear the, poor&#xD;
colored crone laugh and cry, "Shor now, Mass' Van&#xD;

Horn, dat's so like you, dat is I" Never did he hesitate&#xD;
to share his clothes or meals with those in minced, but as&#xD;
t~o parting outright with hard, ringing silver, he evinced&#xD;
a decided repugnan~e. All had a claim to hospitality&#xD;
and assistance, but, in his view, none was entitled to&#xD;
money unless it was fairly earned by toil. A ragged,&#xD;
lin~ping sailor came along one day, and stopped at our&#xD;
gate to beg water and food.&#xD;
"What's do matter, Jack ?" asked father.&#xD;
"Stove in, matey," replied the tar; bluffly. "Knocked&#xD;
off yard-arm on to the fore-chains-splintered larboard&#xD;
gain, and got flogged blue by the dickey with a hand-&#xD;
spike for falling off. Took French leave and crawled&#xD;
away. Bound to Philamedelphy. Give us some&#xD;
grub."&#xD;
"Come in de housb, and let's look at you, man."&#xD;
The sailor was taken in, and found to be suffering from&#xD;
a broken limb and some severe contusions. lie was&#xD;
furnished with medical care, and finther and Richmond&#xD;
nursed him as they would a brother until he became&#xD;
well. "Now, then," said Mill-Kill Jake, giving him an&#xD;
old coat and a loaf of bread, "we kin spare you.&#xD;
Travel, and don't let us see your l4gly carcase here agin."&#xD;
Afterwards we discovered that the distressed mariner&#xD;
had helped himself to several of father's best shirts, and&#xD;
two silver teaspoons. "Dere now," said f~tlmer,&#xD;
pleased perhaps at his retrospective sagacity, "didn't I&#xD;
say do feller was a rogue. I tell ye what, dere's no de-&#xD;
ceivin' me so easy."&#xD;
Old Richmond said the fellow was a man.o~wrar's~man,&#xD;
and he "nebber seed man-o' ~var's-man wouldn't teal all&#xD;
kid lay hands on." I said, that if ever I saw any old&#xD;

stones at them.&#xD;
"What for ?" asked father.&#xD;
"Cause," said. I, indignantly, "see what thanks you&#xD;
get. Give 'em all they want, and they'll turn right&#xD;
round and rob you." .&#xD;
"Do you aspects danks when you gives anything ?"&#xD;
"Yes," said I.&#xD;
"What kind o' charity you call dat, ch? I calls dat&#xD;
dickering' like a Yankee pedlar. It's your duty to help&#xD;
dem what's poor and. needy, and no one's got right to&#xD;
Spect dank~ only for doin' dere duty. Mind dat."&#xD;
It seems hardly credible that at this time, although&#xD;
living but a few miles apart, the ~two brothers, Jacob&#xD;
and Garret Van horn, had soon each other but twice in&#xD;
a period of fourteen years. Garret came to the wedding&#xD;
when Jacob married Miss Elizabeth Vrceland, and&#xD;
again, met his brother at that Elizabeth Vreeland's&#xD;
funeral nine years after. Not that there was any ilL.&#xD;
feeling between them, for Jacob, on his part, had a&#xD;
most exalted opinion of Garret; he believed him to be&#xD;
one of the most remarkable men in existence, and lost&#xD;
no opportunity of extolling the talent and excellences&#xD;
of the wealthy merchant. Every autumn it was custo-&#xD;
mary for Jacob to take a waggon-load of cabbages to&#xD;
Garret's house. As he always arrived there in the fore-&#xD;
noon ho never met his brother, but Mrs. Garret received&#xD;
him very kindly, and after the cabbages were stowed&#xD;
away in the cellar time two had a little chat together in&#xD;
the dining-roon'i--~-and they were both very talkative~-&#xD;
until Jacob deemed it time to return to Communipaw.&#xD;

was more an object of mirth than attention, and often&#xD;
left the mauvais .sujets in' despair, and with a paper&#xD;
parcel of frog-legs, caught in a ten minutes' brookside&#xD;
ramble, in his flap pocket.&#xD;
Old Crumbie was considered by the scholars as the&#xD;
very concentration and personification of cruelty and&#xD;
meanness. He- seldom appeared in the school-room but&#xD;
to administer punishment, to which he applied himself;&#xD;
we thought, with great, relish. He invariably pre-&#xD;
faced the correction with a long homily wherein he&#xD;
alluded to his being under a "painful necessity," and&#xD;
orated otherwise on the mental distress it cost him to&#xD;
perform this duty, but nevertheless, heartier ~vere the&#xD;
thwacks, and more numerous in proportion to the length&#xD;
of his sermon and the depth of his sorrow. But the&#xD;
grossest piece of hypocrisy of all, in our opinion, was&#xD;
the meek manner with which he said grace before&#xD;
grace for us, mind you, for he carefully abstained&#xD;
from 'partaking of our fare, and had his tid-bi~s at a side&#xD;
table with his wife and daughter; and then to return&#xD;
gorged,, With delicacies and offer, thanks at our table ! /&#xD;
thanks for such food I It was adding galling insult to&#xD;
deep injury. Washington Baker, familiarly known as&#xD;
Red-head Baker, wrote a letter describing the outrage-&#xD;
ous way in which we were starved, the bad quality of&#xD;
the hash, and other grievances, which he intended to&#xD;
send home, confidently asserting, that his father would&#xD;
"fix old Orumbie," buV unfortunately old Crumbie got&#xD;
hold of the missive by some means or other, and of&#xD;
course was under the "painful necessity" of trouncing&#xD;
Master Baker fbr carrying on a "clandestine correspon-&#xD;
dence."&#xD;
&#xD;
After all, we were not s&amp;amp;nt to schoQl to be pampered,&#xD;
and boarding-school keepers know well enough that full&#xD;
stomachs are incompatible with close application to&#xD;
study. Soon were all these trifling troubles effaced, and&#xD;
but little did they detract from our sum of happiness;&#xD;
indeed, we entertain, I believe, a more agreeable recol-&#xD;
lection of those boyish adventures that were rounded&#xD;
oil by a flagellation, and all incidents of school-life are&#xD;
doubtless niore deeply imprinted by an application of&#xD;
the switch. And in truth we well merited all the&#xD;
punishment we ever received, for a more troublesome,&#xD;
cvilAnclined set of boys were never gathered together.&#xD;
There, for instance, was big Torn Clark, who broke open&#xD;
a closet to steal pies, and when Mr. Crumble undertook&#xD;
to punish him, pui~ched that pedagogue under the waist-&#xD;
band with such desperate fury that Mullinson was&#xD;
obliged to rush to the rescue, overpower Tom, and un-&#xD;
prison him in 'a garret-room. In the night, however,&#xD;
Tom wrenched o the lock, took Mullinson's watch and&#xD;
best coat, ran away to New York, and shipped before&#xD;
the mast on a vessel bound to Manilla. This event occa-&#xD;
sioned an impressive bit of eloquence from Mr. Crunibie,&#xD;
who surpassed any of his previous efforts in that line.&#xD;
He demonstrated conclusively, in Ciceronian periods,&#xD;
and with Deinosthenian ardor, that Tom Clark would&#xD;
conic to a bad end, and pictured him, in a graphic pero-&#xD;
ration, as a pirate hanging in chains, a prey to the vul-&#xD;
tures and cormorants. Unfortunately for the school-&#xD;
master's predicttons, and fortunately f~r Torn, he is now&#xD;
a wealthy deacon, and has sent to Muilinson (now pro-&#xD;
fessor in Brown University) an c~pensive chronometer&#xD;
watch, and a suit of fine clothes.&#xD;

GARRJ~T VAN HORN.&#xD;
&#xD;
Worthy Muihuson! methinks I see him now as ho&#xD;
sallied forth on clear Sabbath mornings accota~red in all&#xD;
the bravery of a swallow-tail coat, pruneila gaiters, and&#xD;
strapped trousers. How gallantly he held the parasol&#xD;
over Miss Araminta Crumbie's head as they brought up&#xD;
the rear of the church-going procession! And the&#xD;
grating, wheezing scrapes that issued from his bass-viol,&#xD;
as he sat gravely in the little church-choir, one eye on&#xD;
Handel and haydn and the other vigilantly watching&#xD;
the apple-munching urchins in the adjoining pews!&#xD;
Does not nature bedeck herself on the Sabbath days,&#xD;
when the plough rests in the furrow and the oxen graze&#xD;
without fear of the yoke? I fancied so when gazing&#xD;
through the lom~g church windows at the bright green.&#xD;
landscape, so still and serene, save the song of the shrill-&#xD;
ing locust, the drone of the bee, and the breezy rustle&#xD;
of the tree-leaves; and I sighed and~ became drowsy,&#xD;
watching the ~gently swaying boughs as the parson's&#xD;
long sermon came not to an end, so that Mr. Crumble&#xD;
marked my inattention and gave me a chapter in the&#xD;
Testament to commit to memory as a punishment there-&#xD;
for. I was no favorite with Mr. (Jrumbie. lie sus-&#xD;
pected, and with some jn~tice, that I was giveA to lead&#xD;
others into misehieg and the affair of the slaughtered&#xD;
gosling confirmed his suspicions. That occurred in this&#xD;
wise; Myndert, who continued to exercise his mechani-&#xD;
cal ~ki1l in water-mills, waggons, trap-cages anti what-&#xD;
not, made a handsome bow-gun with cherry-wood stock&#xD;
and hickory bow, but it needed a good bow-string to&#xD;
complete it, and as we were going into the woods one&#xD;
afternoon to prove it on the feathered tribe, i~ boy sug-&#xD;
&#xD;
gcs'ted that one of the cords of Mr. Mullinson~s bass-&#xD;
viol would make a capital bow-string. This was a good&#xD;
idea, but the rub was how to obtain the coveted arti-&#xD;
cle. Finally, good-natured Myndert volunteered to ab-&#xD;
stract it from the instrument. lIe did so safely, and off&#xD;
we gleefully went with intention fell towards all bobo-&#xD;
links and chipmunks that should cross our path. But&#xD;
Diana was unpropitious, and the quarry scorned the&#xD;
quarrel, so not to be balked of all sport, as we were&#xD;
returning by the turnpike, whizz! I let fly at a flock, of&#xD;
geese waddling peacefully along the rqad not far from a&#xD;
farmhouse. The pile transfixed a gosling, that after a&#xD;
few screeching quacks ~trctched out its yellow legs and&#xD;
died. The other geese surrounding their dead com-&#xD;
panion, set up a great noisy gabble which attracted the&#xD;
farmer's attention, who, crawling alongside a stone fence&#xD;
unperceived by us, on a sudden pounced upon inc.&#xD;
With a quick wrench I escaped from his grasp, and away&#xD;
we all scudded as fast as our legs could carry us. But&#xD;
unfortunately, he had captured the bow-gun, which was&#xD;
sumcient to inspire us with apprehensions of a lively and&#xD;
unpleasant kind. The next day was Sunday, and I&#xD;
trembled to think of Mr. Mullinson's wrath on discover-&#xD;
ing that his b~iss-viol was robbed of a string. I held my&#xD;
breath in church when he drew off the green-bag-I&#xD;
saw him scrape and screw-suddenly he stopped-I&#xD;
turned my head aside with a sinking heart, for I knew&#xD;
he ~as scanning our faces. Myndert was stolid as the&#xD;
figure-head of a frigate. I looked again; Mullinson was&#xD;
whispering to Miss Araminta, and then proceeded slow-&#xD;
ly and sorrowfully to enrobe his darling instrument.&#xD;
Poor fellow, he had not the skill of a Paganini, and all&#xD;

&#xD;
harmony fled at a missing string. The morrow was the&#xD;
day of reckoning, and betimes up came~ the despoiled&#xD;
farmer with the unfortunate bow-gun, to lay his com-&#xD;
plaint before Mr. Crumble.&#xD;
The school was mustered.&#xD;
Mr. Crumble mounted the rostrum, and as he rapped&#xD;
forcibly on the desk with his rattan, we instinctively felt&#xD;
that there was a raging Nemesis within him. "Silence !"&#xD;
said he.&#xD;
You could have heard a pin drop. M4lllinson, who&#xD;
stood by Mr. Crumble examining the bow-gun, spoke&#xD;
some words to him in an under-t6ne, while the boys&#xD;
looked at me as the shipmates of the Ancient Mariner&#xD;
did at that venerable tar after he had killed the alba-&#xD;
tross.&#xD;
"Whose cross-bow is this?" asked Mr. Crumble.&#xD;
No answer.&#xD;
"I shall ask but once more-whose bow is this ?"&#xD;
(with a sharp rap on the desk.)&#xD;
"It belongs to me," said Myndert.&#xD;
"Come forward, sir. Now, sir, in the first place,&#xD;
where did you obtain this string ?"&#xD;
"From Mr. Mulhinson."&#xD;
"Did Mr. Mulhinson give it to you?"&#xD;
"No, sir."&#xD;
"Well then-come, sir, no prevarication-~how did&#xD;
you obtain possession of it ?"&#xD;
"I took it."&#xD;
"Ah-you took it without permission. Plainly speak-&#xD;
ing, stole it. Are you aware of the nature of that&#xD;
offence? Do you know that it is larceny-that it is a&#xD;
crime rendering you obnoxious to the hiws of the land?"&#xD;

GARRET VAN HORN.&#xD;
Myndert looked at his shoes without replying. I was&#xD;
anxiously awaiting the crisis, and hoping selfishly that&#xD;
all would end in only Myndert's being flogged and the&#xD;
rest of us escaping.&#xD;
"You feel guilty, do you? and dare not answer? I&#xD;
am glad to perceive that you are not entirely lost to&#xD;
shame. That there still lingers in your conscience a&#xD;
faint sense of the heinous offence you have omittede.&#xD;
Painful to me as is this portion of my duty, and how-&#xD;
ever gladly would I relinquish it, yet may I not. The&#xD;
responsibility I owe to each of you, to your parents, and&#xD;
to myself, compels me to summon my fortitude and&#xD;
inflict the punishment of the rod, that I may receive your&#xD;
future thanks for the salutary correction. Myndert&#xD;
Van Horn, sir, hold out your hand."&#xD;
Thwack~! thwack! thwack! etc., etc.&#xD;
Myndert never winced.&#xD;
"Remember, Myndert," said Mr. Crumble, as he was&#xD;
putting it on, "that it pains me much more than it does&#xD;
you. The other hand, sir," And two dozen other&#xD;
thwacks, sharper if possible, were applied.&#xD;
"Now, Myndert, for the second count. You were&#xD;
one of the party who went out last Saturday" afternoon&#xD;
and killed a gosling of Mr. Purdy's with the cross-bow,&#xD;
were you not ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"Now, sir, tell me the names of your accomplices."&#xD;
No answer.&#xD;
"Come, sir, tell me at once withor~t any hesitation."&#xD;
No answer.&#xD;
* "Myndert, I will have no trifling. You place me&#xD;
again under the painful necessity of correcting you, but&#xD;

&#xD;
there must be no faltering on my part. Your hand,&#xD;
sir."&#xD;
Though Myndert's hands Were blistered by the blows&#xD;
he had already got, he held them out stoutly and took&#xD;
another dose.&#xD;
"Now, sir, will you answer&#xD;
Myndert still maintained a stubborn silence, Mr.&#xD;
Crumble caught him by the collar of his coat, threw him&#xD;
over a bench, and administered to him a trouncing of&#xD;
the most severe kind, until forced to desist by the break-&#xD;
ing of the stick. "Now, sir," said Mr. Crun~~bie, breath-&#xD;
less, "you'll thank me for this-you'll thank me for this !"&#xD;
Myndert stood it like a Trojan, and never flinched.&#xD;
After regaining his breath, Mr. Cruiiibie said, "Are you&#xD;
ready now, sir, to answer my questions ?"&#xD;
(Myndert more stubborn than ever.)&#xD;
"Very well, sir, I shall lock you up in solitary con-&#xD;
finement until you are ready to answer. You will thus&#xD;
have plenty of time to reflect upon the effects of your&#xD;
contumacy."&#xD;
There were conflicting emotions of selfishness and duty&#xD;
at work among the boys whom Myndert courageously&#xD;
refused to betray. I, chief offender and chief coward,&#xD;
long repented that I did not at first avow myself sole&#xD;
author of the mischief. It was reserved for the young-&#xD;
est lad in the party to act the manly part.&#xD;
"Please, sir," said IAcky Prime, "I was one of 'em,&#xD;
A sir."&#xD;
&#xD;
"4,&#xD;
&#xD;
"Ah, you were one, Richard, were you? Very well,&#xD;
and who were the others ?"&#xD;
Dicky became interested in his jacket buttons,&#xD;
Shamed out of my selfish cowardice by little Dick, I&#xD;
&#xD;
came forward and avowed myself the slayer of Mr.&#xD;
Pu:rdy's gosling.&#xD;
"It would have been more to your credit, sir, had&#xD;
you made this confession before. Now, sir, who were&#xD;
the others ?"&#xD;
Following my example four other boys stepped forth,&#xD;
thus saving the schoolmaster further catechizing.&#xD;
"It is a humiliating spectacle, indeed," began Mr.&#xD;
Crumbic, gazing sternly at the culprits, "to behold such&#xD;
youthful depravity, and not only humiliating, but pain-&#xD;
ful, very painful. I shall postpone further remarks until&#xD;
after school hours, so as not to interfere with your&#xD;
studies. You may resume your seats.'~&#xD;
We knew well enough that the schoolmaster's inten-&#xD;
tion in remitting the floggings was solely to rep6se his&#xD;
wearied arm and gather strength towards a resumption&#xD;
of hostilities. But forewarned is forearmed, and we&#xD;
took the precaution to resin our hands to make them&#xD;
callous, and to clothe ourselves in an extra pair of trowa&#xD;
sers over a layer of copy-books. We agreed, also, ~o&#xD;
keep up a constant squirming and howling during the&#xD;
flagellation, so as to prevent the unusual percussion&#xD;
from awakening in Mr. Crumble's mind a suspicion of&#xD;
our stratagem. No sooner was four o'clock post-meridKan&#xD;
come,~ than the schoolmaster rapped on his desk and&#xD;
ordered the offending party before him, The seven&#xD;
transgressors slowly ranged themselves beneath the&#xD;
pedagogical eye, and had not Mr. Crumbic beca pur-&#xD;
blind he might have observed a remarkable enlargement&#xD;
of the lower half of each boy's body. "it is a humili..&#xD;
ating spectacle; indeed, and not only humiliating, but'&#xD;
painful, exceedingly painful," etc., etc.,-began the school-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7699-00000022"/>&#xD;
master, while we, heedless of the usual exordium, no~&#xD;
ticed with dismay that he was provided with three new&#xD;
and thick rattans. At the conclusion of his speech~ Mr.&#xD;
Crumble seized Dicky Prime, and began operations.&#xD;
Dicky squirmed, yelled, and screeched so, that I feared&#xD;
he would overdo it, but the schoolmaster was catis-&#xD;
fled with giving him a moderate whipping, and then&#xD;
proceeded to attend to me. I acted my part well and&#xD;
bellowed rhythmically as each cut of the stick descended,&#xD;
and though my share was elaborately inflicted, I felt it&#xD;
only where some chance blows fell on my unprotected&#xD;
arms. The next in turn, a witless dolt, wishing to ap-&#xD;
pear plucky, would not cry, but kept a stupid grin on&#xD;
his ugly face. I saw our danger and could have kicked&#xD;
him, for Mr. Crumble, on hearing the clear sounding raps&#xD;
produced by his stick, at once divined the cause, and&#xD;
bade the boy doff his jacket. He did so, very re-&#xD;
luctantly, when out dropped a copy-book. Then Mul-&#xD;
linson made search, and found the culprit invested in&#xD;
two pairs of pantaloons lined with copy-books. The&#xD;
rest of us were also examined and found similarly padded.&#xD;
When the obstacles were removed, Mr. Crumble recoin-&#xD;
menced his task and gave us all a double allowance in&#xD;
reward for our ingenuity.&#xD;
The confiscation of the bow-gun and the floggings did&#xD;
not deter us, however, from clubbing together and in-&#xD;
vcsting our pocket-money in the purchase of a real,&#xD;
genuine, wood-and-iron gun! It was an old Tower&#xD;
musket, bought of the village blacksmith, who recom~&#xD;
mended it strongly as having done good service in ~he&#xD;
"Revolooshanary war" by laying low many a rascally Red-&#xD;
coat. He expatiated, otherwise, on its extraordinary&#xD;
&#xD;
qualities as a fowling-piece, but on this score (however&#xD;
well adapted for patriotic purposes) it proved a failure,&#xD;
for by reason of the conformation of the ~tock and a&#xD;
burnt breech-pin its recoil was so forcible as to cause the&#xD;
shooter to shut his eyes before pulling the trigger,&#xD;
whereby much execution was prevented. However, we&#xD;
didn't discover all that until we started off next Satur-&#xD;
day, after breakfast, a knot of happy joyful boys to test&#xD;
this formidable weapon. Myndert, obliging fellow, had&#xD;
procured the ammunition, a blacking-box full of powder&#xD;
and an old grammar for wadding. We tossed up for&#xD;
first shot. I won, and shouldering the gun, away we&#xD;
slily sped, brushing through a field of tall maize, over a&#xD;
rail fence, and breaking cover in a shorn wheat-field.&#xD;
Oh, the glee and buoyancy of fourteen, in tNck boots&#xD;
and unspoilable clothes! tramping through the yellow&#xD;
stubble, crushing clover and timothy, climbing rocks and&#xD;
leaping ditches, but halt !-there on the woolly tip of a&#xD;
mullein stalk flutters a yellow-bird. Beckoning to my&#xD;
companions to keep silent, I raise the heavy musket, and&#xD;
after a long interval of apprehension and unsteadiness&#xD;
brace my nerves and pull the trigger. Bang!-the sharp&#xD;
report echoes away and away among the hills, but the bird&#xD;
has flown off uninjured, and a whoop of derision greets&#xD;
my unsuccess. I am pale and indignant, and attribute&#xD;
my failure to a surplus of wadding. The next sY~are-&#xD;
holder whose turn it is, is ambitious, and aspires to kill&#xD;
bigger game, a partridge or a meadowlark at least. So&#xD;
on we trudge through a swamp-meadow with its grass&#xD;
so gree~i and its springy sod; grasshoppers we scatter&#xD;
at every footstep, and a little garter-snake discovered&#xD;
gliding away is set upon and killed. hark to the short&#xD;

&#xD;
plaintive whistle of a quail-yonder! in that apple oi~~&#xD;
chard somewhere among the hazel bushes along its Qdge.&#xD;
A boy imitates the cry-a moment after, the bird re-&#xD;
plies "Bob White !" Swiftly we hasten towards the&#xD;
Bound, dashing through sumach and elder-bushes, and&#xD;
over a black, muddy brook;. thung! thung! go the&#xD;
frightened frogs as they dart into the water with a noise&#xD;
like the snap of a banjo-string. "Bob White! Bob&#xD;
White !"-still lures us on until we are now in the&#xD;
orchard. Where is it? Now, all is silent. The very&#xD;
locusts have hushed their shrilling at our approach.&#xD;
We seek, but find not-perhaps it has flown into the&#xD;
next lot among that clump of cedars? There! sure&#xD;
enough, flutters something among the boughs. "A&#xD;
partridge !" exclaims Myndert. "Lay low !" hisses the&#xD;
boy with the gun, cocking it, and. bending down. We&#xD;
stand motionless, while he stoops along quietly with ear&#xD;
and eye alert; but nothing is seen or heard of the bird,&#xD;
and at length he rises and is about to return, when,&#xD;
whirr! out of the bushes close by his head rushes some-&#xD;
thing brown-confused, he fires at random, and we hear&#xD;
the shot pattering on the leaves and simultaneously a ~&#xD;
howl-a human howl! We run behind the bushes and&#xD;
behold Nosey Mason flat on his back, bawling, "Mur-&#xD;
der! I'm shot-I'm killed !" Such consternation! we&#xD;
raise poor wounded Nosey, and on examination find his&#xD;
left leg badly peppered. The boy who caused this&#xD;
accident is half frantic with terror, and offers Nosey all&#xD;
he has about him, his knife, three cents, and a gimlet,&#xD;
to mend the matter. But Nosey refuses, for Nosey is&#xD;
a trump, promise~ not to tell Mr. Crumble, and says lie&#xD;
won't mind it niucI~ if the doctors don't cut his leg oIL&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
I      ~        VAN HORN.&#xD;
We reassure him on that point, and each, relates how he&#xD;
has had far worse injuries than that. We hide the gun&#xD;
in the woods, help our poor limping comrade along, and&#xD;
concoct a story about the accident which effectually&#xD;
exonerates us and misleads Mr. Crumble, in spite of all.&#xD;
his sagacity, thanks to Nosey Mason's manliness.&#xD;
Ill-starred Nosey Mason (his real name was ~ienzi&#xD;
Mason), what a series of mishaps befell him! He was&#xD;
the unluckiest fellow in school. lie was stung by&#xD;
hornets, and bitten by dogs, and nearly terminated his&#xD;
wretched existence in a variety of ways. Water, espe-&#xD;
cially, was inimical to him; and on hot August after-&#xD;
noons, when we broke bounds to bathe in the limpid&#xD;
waters of the beautiful Bronx, near the old mill with&#xD;
The sleepy pool above the darn,&#xD;
The pool beneath it never still,&#xD;
Nosey Mason, I say, came within an ace on two occa-&#xD;
sions of being sucked through the race, and once,&#xD;
attempting a vertical dive, en~ibedded his curly pate into&#xD;
the soft mud to such a depth, that he never rose until&#xD;
Myndert plunged in and extricated him by the leg.&#xD;
A score more of such little adventures would I recount&#xD;
were they as interesting to the reader as they are to&#xD;
me, for I know no pleasures of memory like those con-&#xD;
nected with boyhood-days spent in the country, peru.&#xD;
haps because I now see nature but froni* the back of a&#xD;
horse or the seat of a carriage, and can no longer&#xD;
stretch, roll, or lie on the greensward beneath a branch-&#xD;
ing tree; clothes and dignity alike forbidding it.&#xD;

GABI~ET VAN £IGRTh&#xD;
&#xD;
Although gifted with quick perception and a reten~&#xD;
tive memory, I achieved but little as a scholar. These&#xD;
very faculties, united to a good share of indolence,&#xD;
greatly impeded my intellectual progress, and like the&#xD;
hare in the fable I loitered by the wayside relying on&#xD;
my powers, while duller boys outstripped me. What J&#xD;
did learn beyond geography and arithmetic was entirely&#xD;
parrot knowledge. I parsed and prayed about grammar&#xD;
with but a vague idea of its application, and knew less&#xD;
of it tfran can be acquired b&amp;amp; one careful perusal of&#xD;
Cobbett's admirable treatise. In history, of course, we&#xD;
were served the classical and absurd fables of antiquity,&#xD;
and a narrative of modern events,, often illogical and&#xD;
illiberal, in this way cramming us with a mass of dis-&#xD;
torted or exaggerated. facts that it takes years to eradi-&#xD;
cate. Much of my time was taken up in the diligent&#xD;
reading of novels, whose "pictured pages" I far pre-&#xD;
ferred to those of Livy or Cwsar. I had also arrived at&#xD;
that period of life when the blossoming of innate conceit&#xD;
deluded me into the belief that I was wondrous wise,&#xD;
and possessed of education enough for all the purposes&#xD;
of life. Myndert I had heard so often disparaged, and&#xD;
myself held up as the hope of the family, that, com-&#xD;
pletely, convinced of my intellectual superiority, I re-&#xD;
garded my less favored brother with a feeling akin to&#xD;
affectionate contempt. Myndert, in truth, was dull-&#xD;
looking and heavy at play, and his taciturnity ~nd&#xD;
phlegm gave him the appearance of one on a short&#xD;
allowance of brains. He was also slow to take a joke,&#xD;
and easily "sold," and being withal good-natured, he&#xD;
was made a butt of among the boys, who nicknamed&#xD;
him "Chuckle-head Van Horn," and "Leo's ~" the&#xD;
&#xD;
GARRET ~AN hORN.&#xD;
&#xD;
47&#xD;
&#xD;
latter appellation in consequence of the longitude of&#xD;
those limbs. But he took it all in good part, until one&#xD;
day he surprised us by an exhibition of unwanted anger&#xD;
and pugnacity. The winter after we entered the school&#xD;
there came two Cubans, brothers, slim, spindle-shanked&#xD;
fellows they were, who shivered with cold in their linen&#xD;
clothes, danced with glee on seeing the snow fhll, and&#xD;
actually asked for chocolate at breakfast the morning&#xD;
after their arrival. So outrageously funny ~ demand&#xD;
became a standing joke, and Jgnacio and Jos6 were con-&#xD;
tinually being asked whether they preferred chocolate&#xD;
to burnt beans and hot water. One day, Dicky Prime&#xD;
propounded this question for the hundredth time to&#xD;
Ignacio, who, becoming enraged at the perpetual baiting&#xD;
he was subjected to, gave the little fellow a sound&#xD;
cuffing in. revenge. As Myndert was endeavoring to&#xD;
separate them the Cuban drew his pocket-knife, when&#xD;
Myndert clutched him by the throat to mak6 him drop&#xD;
the weapon. Ignacio's 'brother ran to the rescue, and&#xD;
also drawing a knife stabbed Myndert in the shoulder.&#xD;
Luckily the wound was but a slight one, and Myiidert,&#xD;
turning quickly on his new assailant, threw him on the&#xD;
ground and gave him a severe pummeling. Of course,&#xD;
Mr. Crumble brought his eloquence and rattan into play,&#xD;
and all concerned, whether as principals, or accessories&#xD;
before and after the fact, underwentthe sermon and chas-&#xD;
tisement. But Myndert Vau Horn's reputation as" cock&#xD;
of the walk "was established~ from that date, and the nick-&#xD;
names "Chucklehead" and "Legs" were heard no more.&#xD;
We spent our vacation at Communipaw. Fathe~',&#xD;

during the short time we were away. It certainly was&#xD;
so with Richmond; but then Richmond was so nrnch&#xD;
farther advanced in age, that one could plainly perceive&#xD;
every step he took towards the grave. The old negro&#xD;
hardly recollected us at first; but when his feeble me-&#xD;
mory brought us slowly back, he inquired where we had&#xD;
been, and bustled about to prepare a dish of soft-crabs&#xD;
for our delectation. Then father took us to all the&#xD;
neighbors in succession, and exhibited us as daring&#xD;
adventurers from distant regions. "Aunt Sall~r, here's&#xD;
de boys !" he would ~ bursting open old Mrs. Vree-&#xD;
land's kitchen door. "Dere dey bee~! dat's Myndert&#xD;

cluded her stare at us through her spectacles, he was&#xD;
oft' to some Van Winkh~, ~an Horn, or Garrabrant,&#xD;
until the major part of the population of Communipaw&#xD;
has passed us in review.&#xD;
When the time for returning to school arrived it was&#xD;
a great trial for father. He h~d no more heart than a&#xD;
girl. We had been s~ constantly with him, and had&#xD;
formed almost his sole society that, particularly since&#xD;
Richmond had fallen into senility, he felt our absence&#xD;
sorely. When we parted the tears filled his eyes, yet I&#xD;
heeded it not; but Myndert and I speak about it very&#xD;
often, now that he has floated far away from us on the&#xD;
waves of time.&#xD;
Myndert remained but six months longer at Mr.&#xD;
Crumble's,; and at the expiration of that time was bound&#xD;
apprentice, at his request, to Mr. Berg a ship-builder&#xD;
6f New York, all his friends agreeing that he would&#xD;
succeed better in ~j~ianual occupation than in an intel-&#xD;
lectual one.&#xD;

&#xD;
I was kept at school for a year after Myndert's de-&#xD;
parture, during which time I suffered from a dangerous&#xD;
illness, which seriously threatened my existence. But&#xD;
tihe strength of a young constitution saved me. The&#xD;
sickness proceeded from my accidentally eating some&#xD;
poisonous mushrooms. It was customary every Satur-&#xD;
day for a club of us to deflect ourselves with a sympo-&#xD;
sium of our~ own concocting, such as a course of grilled&#xD;
red-herrings, followed by green apples, or a wash-basin&#xD;
full of oysters, and a dessert of crackers and cheese.&#xD;
We had built a fire-place back of the school-house to&#xD;
cook. our comestibles, and on one occasion we had. a&#xD;
feast of more than ordinary suiiiptuousness. There were&#xD;
fried cat-fish and roasted ears of maize, then stewed&#xD;
mushrooms and frog-legs, and for dessert three big&#xD;
water-melons. Unluckily among the mushrooms were&#xD;
a few toad-stools, which toad-stools fell mostly to my&#xD;
share. So between these delicacies, as it takes no phy-&#xD;
sician to foresee, I was a very sick boy that following.&#xD;
night. Another lad who had partaken of the toad-&#xD;
stools was also taken ill, but soon recovered, Greedy&#xD;
I, having probably eaten a greater share of those vile&#xD;
fungi, was kept to my bed for a month. They removed&#xD;
me from the dormitory to a separate bed-room, and well&#xD;
do I remember those long tedious hours of convalescence&#xD;
that followed the period of fever and pain. Wearily&#xD;
dragged the days, broken but by the entrance of nurse&#xD;
or physician, as I lay feeble in my little cot, transpos-&#xD;
ing and tracing in my mind the arabesque scrolls on the&#xD;
wall-paper, or listening to the shouts of my schoolmate&#xD;
as they frolicked in the enjoyment of robust health.&#xD;

reached me in strange distant sounds, &amp;amp;s if I would never&#xD;
~again see them, or mingle in their play.&#xD;
When able to rise and walk about the room in a&#xD;
dizzy, weak way, Mr.-~'4~ruKmbie kindly took me With&#xD;
him for a ride on a fine bright day, and as we rode&#xD;
along and the cool breeze fanned my thin cheek, my&#xD;
a.        languid frame drank in large draughts of new life and&#xD;
new strength at every respiration.&#xD;
The fact of my illness had been studiously kept from&#xD;
the knowledge bf my relations, but now that I was fast&#xD;
regaining my pristine condition, Mr. Crumble informed&#xD;
to the city at once, as change of air would no doubt&#xD;
- Aunt Jane of it, who wrote back that I had better come&#xD;
permanently establish my health, Glad* to comply&#xD;
with her request, I determined in my mind that this&#xD;
departure should be a final separation from school and&#xD;
its duties.&#xD;
When I arrived at Aunt Jane's, she sent word to&#xD;
father, who caine immediately over to see me and was&#xD;
quite alarmed to learn that .1 had been so near death's&#xD;
door. He insisted on taking me back to Communipaw.&#xD;
"Pshaw !" said Aunt Jane. "No one there lit you&#xD;
and old Richmond, and you can hardly take care of&#xD;
yourselves, let alone anybody else."&#xD;
"You see, Jane, de boy '11 git quite strong of he oney&#xD;
gits where dere's boats and salt-water."&#xD;
So I did get strong, and enjoyed myself very much&#xD;
with the "Gallinipper," and in leading astray by deceit.&#xD;
ful art, confiding weakfish and bass. Once a week&#xD;
Myndert came home, and these little family gatherings&#xD;
were always sources of much delight to father; but&#xD;
about this time we lost poor old Richmond, who drop~&#xD;
&#xD;
pod off like an over-ripe pear. Father felt his loss&#xD;
keenly, and Myndert endeavored to persuade him to&#xD;
sell the farm and take up quarters with Aunt Sarah Van&#xD;
Reypen, or Aunt Annake Briuckerhoff; his two remaining&#xD;
sisters. "For," argued Myndert, "Qarry must leave&#xD;
soon to live with Uncle Garret, and you'll be all alone,&#xD;
then, father."&#xD;
"Can't help it, Myndert," replied father, sadly,&#xD;
"can't leave de old house, anyhow. No-no----dat&#xD;
wouldn't do. You boys is young and you must make&#xD;
your way in de world. My race is run and I'm out o'&#xD;
bret' and must rist awhile. No-no----dem trees and&#xD;
me, we stays here."&#xD;
"Well-but, father, you can't stay here all alone.&#xD;
Suppose you were to fall sick, why, you might even die&#xD;
for the want of some one to help you," said Nyndert.&#xD;
"Well, ef IL do die, I 'spose dat my time's bout come.&#xD;
I guess I live so long now widout any sickness dat when&#xD;
I does fall sick it 'ill be in earnest. Dc doctors won't&#xD;
make much out 0" me."~&#xD;
"Father-..fhther !" e5~claimed Myndert, "you musn't&#xD;
say that. I'll get Aunt Sally to talk you into 1.eason.&#xD;
I'm going round the village to invite all hands to make&#xD;
themselves at home here, so if you want to get rid of a&#xD;
crowd and savc expense, you'll have to move off to&#xD;
Aunt Sally's, and she'll be mighty glad to have you&#xD;
come, you know."&#xD;
Myndert did attempt this stratagem, but without suc-&#xD;
cess, and neither our cunning, nor Aunt Sally's and&#xD;
Aunt A~rnake's persuasions, could induce "Mill-Kill&#xD;

GARRET VAN hORN,          53&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
A. DEPEYSTER &amp;amp; CO.&#xD;
A  ~n now another recruit was added to that vast&#xD;
army which is continually engaged in internecine&#xD;
strife; of which each soldier's ambition is to acquire the&#xD;
largest quantity of booty, and attain thereby the exalta-&#xD;
tion invariably accorded to the g~ediest of spoils ;-to&#xD;
take a place in the ranks and fight the battle of life-to&#xD;
elbow, and trample, and struggle any way possible into&#xD;
success. In more homely phraseology, I was about to&#xD;
enter my uncle's counting-room as a junior clerk, and&#xD;
had parted from the home of my childhood to abide with&#xD;
my relatives in New York city.&#xD;
The evenin~ of my arrival in Madison ~street, Uncle&#xD;
- Garret addressed to me a few words on the subject of&#xD;
my future career. In all the short interviews I previ-&#xD;
ously had with him, he never exhibited any of that&#xD;
interest in me one would naturally expect from a near&#xD;
&#xD;
relative who designed to replace a parent; but my aunt&#xD;
explained this by saying that, besides being of a re-&#xD;
ticent character, he was always mucl~ preoccupied with&#xD;
his business matters and had scarcely a moment to&#xD;
think of anything else. Said he to me at tea-table:&#xD;
"You are about,., you are 'bout. to . to. enter upon&#xD;
a new . . . new sphere of action (he never lost time, if&#xD;
possible, an~l interjected this little speech between bites&#xD;
of toast and sips of tea). "A little advice, therefore,&#xD;
before... entering upon... this., . this sphere is very&#xD;
necessary. ~Iost folks imagine that to be . . . a clerk&#xD;
or a book-keeper or even . . . a merchant is very easy&#xD;
A very easy business and don't require much talent...&#xD;
great n~stake. I consider that to be a * .a good ac-&#xD;
countant even, and not one in a hundred that call them-&#xD;
selves so, ~8 an accountant. . . that to be a geoff accoun-&#xD;
tant requires years of toil and practice... A boy enters&#xD;
a store oroffice. . he expects in a few years to be a mer-&#xD;
chant . .~. and don't take pains to master the dQtails.&#xD;
~ So that if we want to get.. to get a. a. thorough sys~&#xD;
thematic book-keeper we must employ a foreigner&#xD;
It is easy enough to make figures and to post, but.. but&#xD;
all that is but . , . is but a small part . . . of the duty.&#xD;
There is first, acdurs~cy, and circumspection, and method,&#xD;
and all these things cannot be acquired . . . except by&#xD;
long practice and by persons especially adapted for&#xD;
them. Another main thing to success is . . . economy&#xD;
without which all other advantages are.. are of no&#xD;
avail. As I think it judicious to . . . to encourage it&#xD;
among young people we will . . . allow you a certain-&#xD;
salary, say.. say three dollars a week for the first year,&#xD;
which is a very liberal compensation and much more&#xD;

thus know where to retrench-I 'throw out these hints&#xD;
for your future guidance, and above them, Ii enjoin you&#xD;
in all your dealings tQ be honest !"&#xD;
Whilst he was talking I was seeking a clue to his&#xD;
character; but I was too young, and too inexperienced in&#xD;
reading the indices to man's nature, and his countenance&#xD;
proved a riddle to me. There was some resemblance&#xD;
between his smooth, blanched, immovable features and&#xD;
my father's rugged, discolored face; both had the light-&#xD;
blue eyes of the family, but while you could look into&#xD;
the clear depths of Jacob's, Garret's looked into yours,&#xD;
and their quick, penetrating glance told of a habit of&#xD;
weighing men and motives.&#xD;
"To-morrow 'morning," added he,. "at half-past&#xD;
seven, you will be at the office to enter on your new&#xD;
duties."&#xD;
With that he returned thanks in succinct terms for&#xD;
the meal vouchsafed to us, drew on his overcoat, and&#xD;
left the house to attend a board-meeting.&#xD;
"Your uncle's always so busy about something or&#xD;
other that I scarcely ever have a chance to speak a&#xD;
word to him. Dr. Rose says he don~t get enough&#xD;
&#xD;
recreation. Still he enjoys good health, while I have&#xD;
such dreadful headaches. Now, I do hope, Garret, you&#xD;
will try and please him, and I haven't the least doubt&#xD;
but what you will," said Aunt Jane, as we went into&#xD;
the parlor to spend the remainder of the evening. This&#xD;
was the same large gloomy double-room in which Myn-&#xD;
dert and I had b6en left two yea&amp;amp;s before. There was&#xD;
something so cloistral about the house, such~ a tomb-&#xD;
like stillness reigned there, that you instinctively felt&#xD;
you were in the home of a man of ascetic nature. An&#xD;
astral lamp shed a dim, religious light over the apart-&#xD;
ment, shadowing several pictures of Scriptural subjects&#xD;
on the walls, and faintly revealing a covered piano in&#xD;
one corner that suggested a palled sarcophagus. The&#xD;
very mantel clock ticked with a smothered sound, and&#xD;
the fire in the grate burned noiselessly. All this de-&#xD;
pressed my spirits so, that in spite of Aunt Jane's affec-&#xD;
tionate welcome, I almost wished myself l3ack in Coin-&#xD;
munipaw. When Aunt Jane took up her sewing I&#xD;
sought for something to read and amuse inc. On the&#xD;
centre table lay a card-basket and a pyramid of beauti-&#xD;
ful books, with a large timeworn family Bible forming&#xD;
the base. Among these volumes were "Byfield on&#xD;
Colossians," "The Pilgrim's Progress," Baxter's "Dying&#xD;
Thoughts," Baxter's "Saints' Rest," and other rehigiois&#xD;
works, all so gorgeously bound as almost to belie the&#xD;
teachings of humility contained in them. I opened the&#xD;
"Saints' Rest," and on the fly-leaf read: Presented to&#xD;
~ks. J Van horn, as a toJ~3n of esteem, by her friend&#xD;
Edmund Rose, Dec. 26th, 1 8-. This work not being&#xD;
to my tast6, I laid it aside and turned over the others;&#xD;
but their titles did not tempt me to a perusal.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Don't you find anything you would like to read ?"&#xD;
asked Aunt Jane.&#xD;
~'o," replied :i:.&#xD;
"Maybe I can get something that would interest you&#xD;
more," and opening a drawer of her work-table, she&#xD;
pulled out from among the laces and thread two&#xD;
volumes. They were "Paul Clifford."&#xD;
"They're novels to be sure-part of it is very flinny,&#xD;
and some quite sad. Doctor Rose lent them to inc.&#xD;
You'd better take them up into your room, and be care-&#xD;
ful not to leave them laying about, for though there's no&#xD;
harm in them, your uncle don't altogether approve of&#xD;
such books."&#xD;
.1 read until Aunt Jane, looking at the clock, said:&#xD;
is most time for your uncle to return, Garret. I&#xD;
think I'd better show you your room," and she led the&#xD;
way up the stairs to the third story. "There," said&#xD;
she, opening the door, "I hope you'll be comfortable.&#xD;
If there's anything wanting you've only to mention it,&#xD;
and you shall have it."&#xD;
It was a large handsomely furnished bed-chamber,&#xD;
with a new carpet, new mahogany bedstead, and toilet-&#xD;
stand, chairs, and bureau to match. Everything about&#xD;
the room appeared so neat, tasty, and cosy, that de-&#xD;
lighted I exclaimed: "Oh, Aunt Jane! how kind you&#xD;
are to have taken so much trouble for me-how shall I&#xD;
thank you?"&#xD;
"Pshaw, child. Give me your trunk-key and I'll pn~&#xD;
your clothes away;" and in a litle while she had placed&#xD;
all my linen in the drawers, and hung my coats and&#xD;
trowsers in the closet; then bidding me good night, she&#xD;
said, "That Dible on the~ table is your uncle's present&#xD;
&#xD;
I hope you won't neglect it, and now you'd better say&#xD;
your prayers and go to bed, as you'll have to get up&#xD;
early to-morrow morning, and be careful about putting&#xD;
out the light, as w&amp;amp;re all dreadfully afraid of fire."&#xD;
So pleased was I at my apartment that I spent a long&#xD;
time in examining every nook, corner, and article in it.&#xD;
Perfectly satisfied with my acquisition I wound up an&#xD;
obese silver watch, that father had given to me, and laid&#xD;
it on a little ebony watch-stand provided for its recep-&#xD;
tion. Then my eye falling on the two volume~, I&#xD;
resumed reading Paul Clifford. So absorbed was I in&#xD;
this romance that the hours passed unwittingly by, and&#xD;
I was only arrested by some loud-mouthed clock strik-&#xD;
ing one, when, remembering my aunt's injunction, I&#xD;
hastened into bed. But the novelty of my situation and&#xD;
the events of the day c~iused a nervous excitation which&#xD;
prevented me from sleeping, and I tossed about rest-&#xD;
lessly for another. hour or so. In this condition, I was&#xD;
led for the first time to reflect upon the change in my&#xD;
position, and the importance of the step I was taking&#xD;
into a new world. My destiny, I perceived, was in my&#xD;
hands, and it needed but well-directed efforts to make it&#xD;
a happy and successful one: Youth may be, as Roche-&#xD;
foucauld says, a continual intoxication and the fever of&#xD;
reason; but it hath its sober moments. I resolved from&#xD;
that instant to cast aside all the freaks and nonsense of&#xD;
boyhood; to lay all my uncle's precepts to heart; to&#xD;
strive to emulate hi~ career, and become such a man.&#xD;
Whilst cogitating thus, and indulging in plans for the&#xD;
future, a-weary with thought and excitement I glided&#xD;
into slumber.&#xD;

&#xD;
A rap on the door awakened me the next morning.&#xD;
"It is quite late, Garret, the breakfast-bell rang long&#xD;
ago," said Aunt Jane. "Your uncle would not let me&#xD;
call you before. Come down as soon as you can."&#xD;
I dressed myself hurriedly and descended. Mr. Van&#xD;
Horn had already left the house, and swallowing my&#xD;
breakfast I hastened after him.&#xD;
~fr. Garret Van Horn Senior's place of business was in&#xD;
South street, not far from Coffee-house Slip. I-Ic occu-&#xD;
pied the lofts over a ship-chandler's, and you saw above&#xD;
the stairway a weather-beaten sign on which could&#xD;
barely be deciphered the semi-effaced inscription of "A.&#xD;
Depeyster &amp;amp; Co." The original "A.," or Abraham,&#xD;
had been lately gathered to the tomb of the Depeysters in&#xD;
Trinity churchyard, and now the firm consisted hut of&#xD;
Garret Van Horn, senior partner and manager, and&#xD;
Abraham Cruger Depeyster, junior partner and manager.&#xD;
The counting-room was on the second floor, a small&#xD;
low-ceiled place divided by partitions and sashes into&#xD;
two offices. The furniture was very old and dingy, and&#xD;
the whitewashed walls were ornamented with a few&#xD;
dusty maps, a rack of cards, and a model of the Abra-&#xD;
ham Depey8ter packet-ship placed in state over a small&#xD;
wooden clock. The house was largely engaged in the&#xD;
China trade, and. the lofts being' almost constantly filled&#xD;
with chests of tea, mats of fragrant cassia, cases of pre-&#xD;
served ginger and other products of the spicy md, we&#xD;
may say the clerks breathed continually the atmosphere&#xD;
of the Central Flowery Kingdom.&#xD;
Were there no other evidence, the antique and well-&#xD;
worn appearance of the appurtenances of the atetier8 of&#xD;
A. Depeyster &amp;amp; Co. would have sufficiently attested that&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. V.~n Horn possessed at least that essential to~ coin.&#xD;
mercial success, economy, for the scarred desks and&#xD;
stools were the same he had dusted when employed as&#xD;
errand-boy by old Abraham; from those chipped and&#xD;
crusted inkstands his inexperienced pen had niado its&#xD;
first scrawls in the books of the house, and now he che-&#xD;
rished them with the strength of long attachment, No&#xD;
luxurious stationery did he admit into that mercantile&#xD;
hive; no laid letter-paper, no patent inkstands nor copy-&#xD;
ing presses; bankruptcy he belieki in Russia bindings&#xD;
and for a long time obstinately resisted the innovation&#xD;
of steel-pins.&#xD;
When I entered, Mr. Van Horn looked up at the&#xD;
clock. "Ab, Garret, I thought you were not coming.&#xD;
I told you half-past seven and it is now a quarter to&#xD;
eight. Mr. J-Jogg, our clock is correct, is it not ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, I believe it is," replied Mr. Hogg, the book-&#xD;
keeper, referring to his time-piece.&#xD;
"What does your watch say, Garret?" continued Mr.&#xD;
Van Horn.&#xD;
A little abashed, I pulled it out and said it agreed&#xD;
with the other time-keepers.&#xD;
"You see, Garret, you are behind-hand. That's a&#xD;
bad beginning; we like to be punctual in this office.&#xD;
You must remedy that. Mr. llogg, this is Mr. Garret&#xD;
Van Horn, a nephew of mine, lie is to be employed in&#xD;
this office. You will please instruct him in his duties.&#xD;
-Mr. Krolz, are the duplicates of' the 'Algonquin's'&#xD;
letters ready? The bags close at ten. Draw on Over-&#xD;
end's for GOGO pounds at oo days and inclose the first to&#xD;
Hope &amp;amp;r Co., for our credit, by same mail. Send it to&#xD;
me and. I will sign it."&#xD;

&#xD;
After issuing these mandates in a quiet, peremptory&#xD;
tone, my uncleretired behind the partition which fQrmed&#xD;
his private office.&#xD;
Mr~ Hogg stationed me at a small desk near a window&#xD;
that afforded a cheerful view of the wharves opposite,&#xD;
and of the shipping, which lay so close that their pro-&#xD;
jecting jib-booms nearly touched our upper windows. -&#xD;
I was furnished with a package of letters, told to docket&#xD;
them neatly and tear off the blank leaves for future use.&#xD;
I had but just ensconced myself on a stool when my&#xD;
uncle reappeared with some bills of exchange in his h~md&#xD;
and the inevitable quill, as well worn as Gibbon's, be~&#xD;
hind his ear. Casting. a glance at me, he said; "Garret,&#xD;
you had better not sit at your desk. Standing is more&#xD;
business-like and--um--better for the chest,"&#xD;
I put the 'stool aside and recommended my work.&#xD;
-After having docketed the letters, a fresh lot were given&#xD;
to me to copy into a letter-book. This I found a tedi-&#xD;
ous job, and was not able to finish it without assistance&#xD;
in time for the mails. At twelve o'clock I received din-&#xD;
ne~-money from Mr. llogg, and my uncle took me to an&#xD;
eating-house near by. It was a cheap refectory, the&#xD;
dishes costing but six cents each. We had a plate&#xD;
* apiece of corned-beef and cabbage, and dumplings for&#xD;
dessert. What bay and oats are to horses was corned-&#xD;
beef-and-cabbage tq IJhcle Van Horn. It was his staple&#xD;
article of consumption, an4 that he dined on it at least&#xD;
two hu~dxed lines in the ypar, is po exaggeration to&#xD;
.say.&#xD;
At one. o'clock the junior partner, Mr. Abraham&#xD;
Cruger Depeystor, made his appearance. A m~u, was&#xD;
be, of collar i~i~id ~mcI luxuriant whisker, who wont io&#xD;
&#xD;
a small looking-glass, passed his hand through his locks&#xD;
so glossy, took ten minutes to examine a pimple on his&#xD;
nose which seemed to concern him much, said, "Fine&#xD;
day" to Mr. Van Horn who, busy writing, returned a&#xD;
brief "Very," entered the clerks' room, stared like a&#xD;
stricken calf at me for three minutes, reentered the&#xD;
inner cell trying to whistle an opera-air he had heard the&#xD;
night before, and not succeeding made an effort to be&#xD;
interested in a Liverpool "Prices-Current ;" failing again,&#xD;
he skilfully dusted his bright boots with his pocket-&#xD;
handkerchief, re-inspected the pimple, and finally, ex-&#xD;
hausted by these achievements, said with a yawn that if&#xD;
they didn't want him for anything "special" he guessed&#xD;
he'd go to dinner,&#xD;
This was about the measure of my first day's expert&#xD;
ence of mercantile life, The following day I was com~&#xD;
imtted to the charge of a lad, also a junior clerk, to be&#xD;
initiated into the labyrinthine ways and multifhrious&#xD;
formalities of the Custom house. This I found very&#xD;
tedious and uninteresting business, and was glad to learn&#xD;
from 1~Xr. Hogg that I was not to be permanently em-&#xD;
ployed at it.&#xD;
Not long after, the Sooloo, one of the ships belong-&#xD;
ing to the firm, returned from Canton. The morning&#xD;
~Wter her arrival, a short bulky man wit~h a fiery face&#xD;
entered the office. This was the captain of the Sooioo,&#xD;
Caleb Bunker by name, a Marblehead man. It is an in-&#xD;
dubitable fact that marfuers, those dwellers on the&#xD;
ocean, lose much of their national cast of countenance,&#xD;
and that the distinctive mould of face ~vhich the lands-&#xD;
men of various countries possess from climatic or other&#xD;

causes becomes generally obliterated i~i those whose&#xD;
homes are on the deep. Thus, one may see French&#xD;
sailors who might well pass muster for British tars;&#xD;
Spanish patrons who could, without incongruity, com-&#xD;
mand high-decked schooners out of Passamaquoddy&#xD;
Bay; and Captain Bunker's phiz might as appropriate-&#xD;
ly have belonged to the skipper of an Amsterdam.&#xD;
galliot or to the master of a Leith smack. -&#xD;
Mr. Van I-Torn was writing when the ship-master en-&#xD;
tered, and though he had not seen him for a twelve-&#xD;
month he continued his work without stopping, simply&#xD;
and curtly answering the sailor's gruff greeting.&#xD;
Captain Bunker sat him down by the stove, squliting&#xD;
tobacco-juice and swabbing his blazing face at inter-&#xD;
vals with a red pungee handkerchief.&#xD;
Five minutes had elapsed crc Mr. Van horn spoke.&#xD;
"Now, Cap'n," said he, "I've just a quarter of an hour&#xD;
to spare to you, for I must be at the Bank by nine.&#xD;
What kind of a passage? Teas and silks gone up since&#xD;
the trouble ? ~Did you leave the Dart at Cum-sing-&#xD;
moon&#xD;
"The Dart had left for Foo-chow. Teas is gone up-.&#xD;
so is silks, some. You'll see by the letters. We had a&#xD;
fine passage-passed the Straits, , Angier, , etc.,&#xD;
- -    etc." The Captain was as sententious as his employer,&#xD;
and spoke as if reading extracts from his log.&#xD;
"You had some trouble with the pirates off Formosa,&#xD;
going out, I learnt by the 'Confucius?'"&#xD;
I pricked up my ears at this question and listened&#xD;
eagerly.&#xD;
"Yes, some. In lat.,-, long1-, 'bout four bells&#xD;
in Mr. Phrney'~ watch, three junks bore down on our&#xD;
&#xD;
larboard quartei~-hailed 'em. First thing we knowed,&#xD;
kgan throwing stink-pots-when I ordered,"&#xD;
"Stop a moment, Captain," interrupted Mr. Van&#xD;
1-loin, who noticed me listening with cycs, cars, and&#xD;
mouth; "Garret, take this letter to the Post-office at&#xD;
once." And so, the reader and I lost the story of Capt.&#xD;
Bunker's engagement with the L~adrone pirates.&#xD;
The staff of clerks attached to the house of' A. Dc-&#xD;
veyster &amp;amp; Co. comprised seven. Mr. Hogg, book-keeper&#xD;
in                                ~   , .~.r. Krolz,&#xD;
chief; Mr. Otter, assistant book-keener&#xD;
CQrr~s~ondin~ clerk; and four subalterns. Mr. ilo~'~&#xD;
£&#xD;
and Mr. Krolz were the oldest two. Mr. Ilogg was&#xD;
an English man, and had been in the service of the firm&#xD;
for twenty-five years, and durhig that tin-ic had laid aside&#xD;
from his salary enough to purchase a snug little house&#xD;
and plot of ground at Gowanus, where he and his wife&#xD;
resided in all possible comfort. The old couple were&#xD;
childless, and all the pleasure plodding Mr. llogg knew,&#xD;
was in keeping a neat set of books and delving and&#xD;
trimming in his garden at Gowanus. Mr. Krolz was a&#xD;
German, erudite and master of several languages and&#xD;
therefore an inValuable clerk as we transacted business&#xD;
with natives of many countries; a stoutish, near-sighted&#xD;
n-ian with a flat florid face and protruding eyes; very&#xD;
grave, very attentive- to his work, and who seldom&#xD;
spoke; perhaps because 1-ic thought so much and smoked&#xD;
so much. Mr. Van horn suspected him of being an&#xD;
atheist from the fact of his spending summer Sundays&#xD;
at Sul)urban beer-houses; and for this ofi'cnco would&#xD;
doubtless have discharged him had it been possible to&#xD;
dispense with his services, Both Xc and 2Mr. lbgg were&#xD;

&#xD;
obliging men, and took such pains to instruct me in my&#xD;
duties that I have always held them in pleasant remem-&#xD;
brance. Mr. Otter was much younger than they, but&#xD;
mo~-e active and keen-witted. Part of his duties con-&#xD;
sisted in taking charge of Mr. Van Horn's priv~ite&#xD;
affairs, for the senior partner~ had ether transact ions&#xD;
~besides those connected with the firm, and was largely&#xD;
engaged in the purchase of bills and promissory notes,&#xD;
vulgarly known as shavingo' paper," from which extra-&#xD;
neous source he added annually to his income some ten&#xD;
thousand 'dollars or so, all earned by the simple but po~.&#xD;
tent application of his signature, and without any outlay&#xD;
of capital.&#xD;
This Otter had come~ into the olfloe a raw country&#xD;
lad, and had worked his way up by tact and business&#xD;
talenL Being ~rnabitious, he was very jealous of me,&#xD;
until he discovered that I was not qualifled to interfere&#xD;
with his plans. I soon learnt to dislike him, for ho was&#xD;
a mean sycophant and schemer. He studied Mr. Van&#xD;
~iorn, and knew that gentleman thoroughly and how to&#xD;
please him. The fellow had without doubt much ability&#xD;
in his way; but he was so mean, ~awirng, and supple,&#xD;
that if he had failed to prosper it would c~rtaiuly have&#xD;
been from no fault of his, lie had ingratiated himself&#xD;
into his employer's confidence by his aptness, shrewd-&#xD;
ness, and devotion. to the interests of the house; and&#xD;
the wonder was, that acute Mr. Van horn did not dis-&#xD;
cover what was patent to. obtuse folks, for Otter had&#xD;
such fulsome ways of exhibiting his ibigned affection for&#xD;
his employer, such as brushing a lIt tie du~t from his&#xD;
coat with the tender sdicitudc of a toady, arranging his&#xD;
cravat-tie, or wiping hi~ spectacles, that, whi~o the&#xD;
&#xD;
object of these small attentions accepted them so gravely,&#xD;
they provoked the mirth of evem the colored porter.&#xD;
OtteP was striving as an important step in his ad-&#xD;
vancement to supplant old Mr. Hogg, in his position of&#xD;
chief.accountant and confidential clerk, and to effect this&#xD;
was constantly spying over the bookkeeper and ~silly&#xD;
reporting all his little short-comings to Mr. Vai~ Horn.&#xD;
Otter was likely enough to succeed in his object, for Mr.&#xD;
Hogg was aged, and forty years of drudgery at the&#xD;
desk and continued staring a~ white paper had begun to&#xD;
affect eyesight and accuracy.&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
U~WLE GARRET&#xD;
F ou more than six months after my introduction to the&#xD;
house of A. Depeyster &amp;amp; Co., I was an estimable&#xD;
youth. I rapidly~ acquired a knowledge of the details&#xD;
and routine of business, and being expert at figures&#xD;
began to be quite useful. In short, I conducted myself&#xD;
in so exemplary a manner, both at the office and. at&#xD;
home, as to obtain my uncle's entire approbation, and an&#xD;
increase of salary.&#xD;
For more than six months, say two hundred days, or&#xD;
forty-eight hundred hours, I steadfastly held by the re-&#xD;
solves I had made on the memorable night of my arrival.&#xD;
No better behaved or more proper lad could there be&#xD;
than I was at this time. I sought no other recreation&#xD;
than an occasional visit with my brother to our father's,&#xD;
and employed my evenings in reading, in listening to&#xD;
the serious conversation of my uncle's visitors, or in&#xD;
N&#xD;

A&#xD;

&#xD;
cultivating the clarinet, for which instrument I had.&#xD;
acquired a taste from Mr. Mullinson, ~vho, let me men-&#xD;
tion, was almost as proficient on the reed as on the&#xD;
string. The profluent melody, however, it must be&#xD;
~aid in passing, soon became displeasing to Uncle Garret,&#xD;
who had no ear for music, and I was forced to confine&#xD;
my practising to the stable-loft. Moreover, I signed the&#xD;
teetotal pledge, and entered the Cold-water Army; in-&#xD;
deed, I was secretary to the Acqua-Pura Lodge of the&#xD;
Sons of the Old Oaken Bucket, and in the words of the&#xD;
eloquent president thereof; " enlisted against King&#xD;
Alcohol and the cohorts of Rum." I also joined a&#xD;
Bible-class, and once ev~ry Thursday and thrice every&#xD;
Sunday went to church, to the old East Dutch Church&#xD;
where Dr. Westervelt held forth, and of which Uncle&#xD;
Garret was a deacon and one of the oldest and most&#xD;
respected members. Sometimes the sewing circle of&#xD;
that church met at our house. This was a society of&#xD;
the ladies of the congregation who assembled once&#xD;
a week to sew for the destitute. These were not only&#xD;
charitable gatherings, but also very pleasant ones, and&#xD;
when they occurred at her house, Aunt Jane would&#xD;
always prepare a little entertainment for her visitors,&#xD;
and this, by the by, was about the nearest approach to&#xD;
a party ever given between the four walls of our deco-&#xD;
rous home; anything more worldly and brilliant being&#xD;
interdicted by Mr. Van Horn, much against, be it said,&#xD;
Mrs. Van Horn's inclinations. It was somewhat of a&#xD;
compromise between the pair in this respect, for the&#xD;
husband, although he disapproved of such things, allowed&#xD;
his wife to indulge in jewellery and gay dresses in return&#xD;
for her abnegation in other matters of vanity and show.&#xD;

&#xD;
These sewing~circle meetings occasioned much lACa~&#xD;
sure; not only by reason of their benevolent object,&#xD;
~it must be said, for though the ladies loved not the poor&#xD;
less they loved gossip more; gossip, in truth, that often&#xD;
verged on scandal. But that did not occur, mind you,&#xD;
until the graver and more sedate portion of the com-&#xD;
pany had left. One evening I recollect well, at our&#xD;
house, they were all as meek and demure as mice while&#xD;
Dr. Westervelt was present; but after he had. gone and&#xD;
my uncle had retired to bed-.which he always did at&#xD;
ten o'clock, at the latest, let what would happen-aud&#xD;
some other solemn folks had c1isappeared, the remainder&#xD;
became as lively and merry as possible. Dr. Rose, the&#xD;
one whose name I had seen on the fly-leaf of the&#xD;
"Saints' Rest," was present. lie was leader of our&#xD;
church choir, and a very agreeable young man, and so&#xD;
full of fun that lie kept them all constantly laughing.&#xD;
Aunt Jane became brisk and bustling, -and Mrs. Robin-&#xD;
son, a comely young widow with long black pensile&#xD;
ringlets, entreated the Doctor to sing, and sing he did&#xD;
very finely. Then, Aunt Jane having alluded to my&#xD;
clarionet-playing, the Doctor insisted on my favoring&#xD;
them~with a specimen. So, after a deal of coaxing I&#xD;
bashfully produced the pipe and tooted harmoniously&#xD;
"Days of Absence," and "Blue-Eyed Mary," at the&#xD;
conclusion of which the Doctor said that there was&#xD;
much "talent there," and that it ought to be " de-&#xD;
veloped." "And by the by," added he, "our organ-&#xD;
blower has left us in rather a cavalier way, and we shall&#xD;
want another next Sunday. How would you like the&#xD;
place, Garret? Nothing like commencing at the foot&#xD;
of the ladder. I shouldn't wonder if we saw you leader&#xD;
&#xD;
of th~ Euterpeans yet. Salary's a dollar a week, and&#xD;
you might as well have it for pocket money as not."&#xD;
"Don't mention about the pay to your uncle, Garret,&#xD;
he wouldn't like to have you earning money on the&#xD;
Sabbath," said Aunt Jane.&#xD;
My religious scruples, however, did not extend so far,&#xD;
and thanking Ji)r4Rose, II told him I accepted his propo-&#xD;
sal.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Aunt Jane had gone up stairs to see, as&#xD;
she said, whether the noise disturbed her husband. Find-&#xD;
big him sound asleep she returned, went to a book-case,&#xD;
and took from some hiding nook a pack of cards. The&#xD;
centre-table was cleared and I was induced to take a&#xD;
hand at cards as Mrs. Robinson's partner, while the&#xD;
Doctor good-naturedly initiated me into the mysteries&#xD;
of whist. By this time the rest of the company had&#xD;
left, and so we f~ur had a very diverting time of it. The&#xD;
Doctor, Mrs. Robinson, and Aunt Jane laughed and&#xD;
talked about a great many people with whom I was un-&#xD;
acquainted, and we did not leave our amusement until&#xD;
long past midnight. Said Aunt Jane, when Dr. Rose&#xD;
and Mrs. Robinson had gone; "Garry, you'd better&#xD;
not mention anything about this to your uncle; he has&#xD;
such queer notions, you know, about many things."&#xD;
Unfortunately I had the perceptive bumps well deve-&#xD;
loped, and these little concealment and inconsistencies&#xD;
of my aunt did not pass unnoticed by me.&#xD;
Who Dr. Rose was, nobody knew, heyon-d his being&#xD;
a young physician who had just returned from Europe,&#xD;
whither he had gone to complete his medical education.&#xD;

dance, all of them about as correct as surmises and&#xD;
rumors generally are. Suffice it to say, that he ~vas a&#xD;
PhiladellAlian who took greatly with the ladies, although&#xD;
wherein lay his attractive power a masculine mind would&#xD;
have been puzzled to discover, for, beyond fine black&#xD;
curly hair and whiskers and black silky eyes cunning&#xD;
and furtive, he was a very ordinary looking mortal;&#xD;
more likely was it owing to a melodious voice, to his&#xD;
tasty attire, and jaunty gentlemanly carriage; these&#xD;
last attributes being even more potent, as we are aware,&#xD;
over female susceptibilities than beautiful features, Mrs~&#xD;
Van Horn made his acquaintance through his attending&#xD;
our church.. He came there regularly and was devout,&#xD;
tristful, and modest in his appearance, so much so as to&#xD;
attract the attentionn of many ladies, who were not so&#xD;
very attentive to the sermon but that they found time&#xD;
to notice and admire that quality in others. When the&#xD;
leader of the choir fell sick, he supplied his place, and&#xD;
drilled the choristers into greater efficiency. All in&#xD;
black, was he, with crape around his hat; a bereaved&#xD;
widower, it was reported, aged twenty-eight, who wore&#xD;
constantly a miniature of his deceased wife between his&#xD;
heart and waistcoat. This curedd his popularity, for&#xD;
how were the ladies of the East Dutch congregation,&#xD;
those at least who had hearts to feel and eyes to see, to&#xD;
resist such an accumulation of attractive qualities? He&#xD;
was installed in their best graces at once!&#xD;
To Mr. Van horn he commended himself by the zeal&#xD;
he manifested in the cause of religion, and subsequently&#xD;
by his professional skill in curing some little ailment with&#xD;
which my uncle was afflicted. Eve long there was 1)0&#xD;
more welcome visitor at our house than the courtly&#xD;
&#xD;
young physician, and it may be a4ded no more frequent&#xD;
one. He would criticism a sermon pr discuss commer-&#xD;
cial topics, as the case might be, with the husband, or&#xD;
entertain the xvife with small talk and the current gossip&#xD;
about fashion and folks of fashion. He was very atten-&#xD;
tive to this lady, and presented her at various Pines with&#xD;
books of a substantial and nourishing character, such&#xD;
s "Byfield on Colossians," "Quarles' Emblems," and&#xD;
Baxter's works. lie had travelled much, and had the&#xD;
knack of describing what he had seen in an inter-&#xD;
esting way, and being withal of an obliging disposi-&#xD;
tion how could he fail to be prepossessing and popu-&#xD;

Occasionally after morning service on Sundays he&#xD;
would accompany Mr. and Mrs. Van Horn home and&#xD;
partake of their noon-day repast, although our Sunday&#xD;
dinners were not at all tempting, but on the contrary&#xD;
frugal and cold, for, if there was any commandmeitt&#xD;
Mr. Van Horn sought to obey to the letter, it was the&#xD;
one enjoining the keeping holy of the Sabbath day.&#xD;
Then no work not absolutely indispensable, was permit-&#xD;
ted to be done in his house; the meals were all prepared&#xD;
on Saturday, and triplicate sets of china and silver were&#xD;
provided to obviate the necessity of cleaning any before&#xD;
Monday; the horses were never disturbed, and every&#xD;
opportunity was given to the servants to improve the&#xD;
sacred day. Of course, the servants were all Pro-&#xD;
testants at least, if not Calvinists, for next to a Jew,&#xD;
Mr. Van Horn hated a Papist, and none stood higher in&#xD;
his favor than Dennis Dooley the coachman, for that&#xD;
honest Corkonian, originally bred for the Popish pi est-&#xD;
hood, had, by a merciful interposition, been rescued from&#xD;

the pit of errors and now, contrite and corpulent, pre-&#xD;
ferred his humble, virtuous calling, to the pomp and&#xD;
luxury of the prelates of Rome. There was no doubt,&#xD;
eitl)er, about the sincerity of Dennis' conversion, for he&#xD;
invariably gorged himself with meat on Fridays, and&#xD;
devoted himself heroically to a series of indigestions&#xD;
during Lent.&#xD;
I cannot say I fully concurred in my uncle's views&#xD;
about cooking on Sundays, but Dr. Rose apparently&#xD;
did, for he often relinquished his landlady's hot dinners&#xD;
to, as I said before, partake of our cold joint and vege-&#xD;
tables. One Sunday morning I had heard a sermon&#xD;
that I fancied remarkably impressive, and I said so to&#xD;
my aunt at dinner.&#xD;
"Yes, very fine," she replied. "Don't you think so,&#xD;
Mr. Van Horn ?"&#xD;
"Very," said Uncle Garret; "I don't think I ever&#xD;
heard Dr. Westervelt make a finer prayer."&#xD;
"I think," said Dr. Rose, who was present, "that&#xD;
his allusion to the Star of Bethlehem was strikingly&#xD;
beautiful."&#xD;
"Did you notice that gentleman in the Ogdens' pew ?"&#xD;
asked Aunt Jane.&#xD;
"Yes; I've noticed him several times with the Ogden&#xD;
girls," said Dr. Rose; "which is the one he is paying&#xD;
attentions to ?"&#xD;
"Amelia, I suppose," said Mrs. Van horn; "I shouldn't&#xD;
think he'd fancy such a fright as Maggie is. His name's&#xD;
Mortimer Dangle, and he's a nephew of Mrs. I~neb-&#xD;
betts'. Those rich ones you know,~-who made such a&#xD;

"She's got the purse-hasn't she ?" hiqudred Mr.&#xD;
Van I-Torn through a mouthful of beef.&#xD;
"Yes, I think so. Her father is Mr. flambo of Phi-&#xD;
ladelphia."&#xD;
"Ah! I thought it couldn't be Knehbetts, for ho&#xD;
has failed twice to my knowledge, and hasn't settled&#xD;
with his creditors yet. How much is Mr. Hambo esti-&#xD;
mated to be worth? You should know, Doctor ?" said&#xD;
Mr. Van horn, who always liked to know how people&#xD;
stood, financially speaking.&#xD;
"From a million to a million and a half;" replied the&#xD;
doctor.&#xD;
"Indeed," said Mr. Van Horn, and he set Mr. Hambo&#xD;
down as a highly respectable man.&#xD;
~' Mr. Mewsbury wasn't in church this morning, he&#xD;
must be sick yet. How old Mrs. Crawfield's getting to&#xD;
look, isn't she ?" said Mrs. Van Horn.&#xD;
'No older than her age," said Dr. Rose.&#xD;
"Now, Doctor, you knGw that's unkind. But she will&#xD;
di ess so youthful, and wear such quantities of' flowers.&#xD;
Mrs. Robinson says she met her at the Morris' party,&#xD;
and she actually looked frightful in short sleeves and&#xD;
low-neck dress. Isn't it ridiculous? and I've heard&#xD;
that her hair isn't her OWn; but of course, she can't&#xD;
help that if, she's lost it, and it's warmer in winter I&#xD;
suppose. What do you think of Mrs. Qucezy's hat?&#xD;
that's the new style Madame Bongtone tells me. Would&#xD;
you get one like it. ?"&#xD;
"I don't exactly fancy the trimming," said Dr. Rose.&#xD;
It appears to me that a delicate shade of lilac would&#xD;
be preferable to the cerise."&#xD;
"Perhaps it would," etc. etc. etc.&#xD;

And they continued this frivolous stiram of talk which&#xD;
struck me, still impressed by the sermon ~ had heard,&#xD;
as exceedingly vain and inappropriate to the day. Can&#xD;
it be, reasoned I, that these people have already, for-&#xD;
gotten the tremendous import of the preacher's words;&#xD;
words still vibrating in my ears, and of such vital in-&#xD;
terest to all ?-and were their thoughts during\ worship&#xD;
wandering on such trivialities as Their neighbors' gar.&#xD;
ment~? They all profess to be proper ~hristians, yet how&#xD;
can this heedlessness accord with theiiS professions?&#xD;
And in this way was I led into a new train of reflec-&#xD;
tion which bore its fruit as you shall presently see.&#xD;
Another Sunday, while I was up in the organ-loft of&#xD;
the East Dutch church busily plying the bellows-lever,&#xD;
for, not to be ungrateful, I must ihention that Dr. Rose&#xD;
had procured for me ~he post of assistant organist as he&#xD;
had promised; and as IL said, I was busy plying the&#xD;
bellows while the chojr were singing that beautiful&#xD;
hymn "I would not live alway," when I saw, clearly,&#xD;
distinctly, and unmistakably, Dr. IRose (the bass) who&#xD;
was standing by the side of the soprano (the pretty&#xD;
widow, Mrs. Robinson) take that soprano's hand in his&#xD;
own and give it a caressing squeeze I So amazed was I&#xD;
at this indecorum,5o shocked at the sacrilege of&#xD;
courting in church, ihat I quite forgot to ply the. lever,&#xD;
and the bellows consequently collapsing, the melody&#xD;
died away in a ridiculous squeak that set many of the&#xD;
cpngregatiOn a.tittering. Mrs. Robinson colored and&#xD;
snatched he.i hand away from the doctor's; Mr. Shafi'er,&#xD;
the organist-in-chief~ was furious; whilst I, all confusion&#xD;
and fear, worked away at the lever with desperate&#xD;
energy to repair my fault; but it was too late, Mr.&#xD;
&#xD;
74&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
Shaffer never forgave me, and I wa~ discharged from my&#xD;
post for neglect otduty.&#xD;
These conversations and incidents were not lost on&#xD;
me, and did not tend to increase my respect for church&#xD;
people. I began to open my eyes and ears, and to&#xD;
think; and youth thinks so seldom, that when it does&#xD;
its cogitations are not without some effect. So in try-&#xD;
ing to reconcile certain incongruous things, I evolved&#xD;
conclusions not at all flattering to some of my- relatives&#xD;
and friends. Especially in regard to my uncle and aunt&#xD;
had I noticed instances of inconsistency which sei~ved to&#xD;
strengthen suspicions that were fast becoming convic-&#xD;
tions in my inexperienced mind. I decided in fact, that&#xD;
my uncle was not much short of' a hypocrite; that reli-&#xD;
gion with him ~vas merely a matter of form, and with&#xD;
my aunt but a matter of fashion. And were all church-&#xD;
members so? Yes, I argued with boyish inconsequence,&#xD;
for are not these considered pillars of piety? It was a~&#xD;
dangerous thought for me; and the crumbling away, as&#xD;
it were, of my belief in human sincerity and truth.&#xD;
how the steeple-like, unapproachable grandeur of Mr.&#xD;
Van ibm's respectability lessened in my estimation;&#xD;
how I, a boy, conquered my awe and dared to weigh his&#xD;
merits and pronounce an unfavorable verdict upon them,&#xD;
were a long story to tell; Certain circumstances, in par-&#xD;
/&#xD;
ticular, which occurred at the counting-room, and certain&#xD;
deductions therefrom, were the chief agents in under-&#xD;
mining my belief in Mr. Van ibm's reputation. As a&#xD;
hero is to his valet, so is a merchant to his clerks. lie&#xD;
may be impenetrable to the world, but from his quill-&#xD;

or spring in the engine called A. Depeyster &amp;amp; Co., and&#xD;
another Mr. Van horn, citizen, and deacon of the&#xD;
East Dutch church, and while as the lever or spring he&#xD;
hesitated not to send a ship to sea or to hire riggers and&#xD;
stevedores to work on the Lord's day, yet as a citizen&#xD;

~or was the thieving of the one hundred dollars the&#xD;
only act that struck me as entirely irreconcilable with&#xD;
honorable conduct. On another occasion, among the&#xD;
letters I had brought from the Post-office was one for&#xD;
Mr. Depoyster, which, as was customary, I laid on his&#xD;
private desk. A small note, it was, superscribed in a&#xD;
woman's hand-writing, which attracted Mr. Van Horn's&#xD;
attention. When I left the inner office, he care-&#xD;
fully closed the door of the blurred-glass part~ion&#xD;
which separated him from the clerks' room, and as I was&#xD;
about resuming my task of copying a "manifest," I saw&#xD;
through a swinging pane, partly open and in range With&#xD;
my desk, Mr. Van Horn take the note, detach the wafer,&#xD;
and read the contents; afte~ which he careftdly resealed&#xD;

and classify poor, weak, human nature. I was a fresh&#xD;
man in the great college of t1~ie world, but ore I bad&#xD;
left the employ of A. Depeyster &amp;amp; Co., I began to learn&#xD;
how beset with temptations is a mercantile \Jife; how&#xD;
infallible it begets a love of lucre, the root jf all evil,&#xD;
and how insensibly it will blunt a conscience keenly sen-&#xD;
sitive to the slightest deviation' from integrity and&#xD;
honor. I learnt, also, that a profuse charity could be&#xD;
associated with meanness and dishonorable dealings, and&#xD;
that the estimable qualities of temperance, industry, and&#xD;
frugality, if not strictly guarded, were liable to lead man&#xD;
into a selfishness ~ar more fatal to the soul than gross&#xD;
vices.&#xD;
What the contents of the violated letter were,&#xD;
never transpired, but they certainly clenched a purpose&#xD;
that Mr. Van Horn had had under consideration for&#xD;
some time~. The business relations beI~xveen the two&#xD;
partners were not of a harmonious kind, and it was evi-&#xD;
dent that the elder member held young ~epeyster in&#xD;
thorough contempt as a worse than useless fifth wheel,&#xD;
and had long come to the conclusion that, as he was&#xD;
abundantly able to dispense with the Depeyster funds,&#xD;
such a partner as Abraham was not only superfluous but&#xD;
highly detrimental. To be sure that young man's father&#xD;
had treated Mr. Van horn li~ke a son; had taken him&#xD;
into partnership and thus enriched him; but what of&#xD;
that? If the elder Depeyster had played the bene-&#xD;
factor it was merely to subserve his personal interests;&#xD;
simply because he deemed it the best policy to pursue;&#xD;
*      and therefore, Mr. Van Horn would be but following the&#xD;
~same principle, in ridding himself of one who shared profits&#xD;
without having assisted to earn. them. Gratitude was out&#xD;
&#xD;
of the question. No merchant should ever permit per-&#xD;
sonal predilections to weigh in the balance of business,&#xD;
and as in this instance there were no predilections of&#xD;
any kind, Mr. Van Horn's mind was soon made up. By&#xD;
their articles of association either partner could dissolve&#xD;
the partnership on giving due notice in writing of this&#xD;
intention; so Mr. Van horn had a balance sheet draxvn&#xD;
off an~ went into close confabnla~1ou with Mr. I-Iogg&#xD;
concerning the state of various accounts, etc., and im-&#xD;
mediately after Mr. Depeystor found on his desk a note&#xD;
informing him, in short and concise terms, that the firm&#xD;
would cease to~ exist in fifteen days from date. Mr.&#xD;
Van Horn was the more anxious and hasty in his pro-&#xD;
ceedings, from the circumstance that at that time&#xD;
Chinese goods were scarce in the market and rising in&#xD;
value, and as the firm had several cargoes of these on&#xD;
their way, he desired to arrange it so as to be able to&#xD;
turn the large gains in prospect to his sole undivided&#xD;
behoof.&#xD;
Surprised indeed was Abraham, when he bread his&#xD;
senior's missive, and very disagreeably surprised too, for&#xD;
the fifteen thousand dollars or so a year he was com-&#xD;
fortably receiving were in great jeopardy. He was&#xD;
frightened, and puzzled, and dissatisfied; ~' Really, I-I&#xD;
-Mr. Van Horn, isn't this a sudden determination on&#xD;
your part?, What's the matter, oh? Anything gone&#xD;
wrong, eh? Anything happenod-are you dissatisfied&#xD;
with me, oh ?"&#xD;
Before replying, Mr. Van Horn arose and shut the&#xD;
partition door, while I, at the same moment, pushed the&#xD;
convenient pane over my desk slightly ajar, so that,&#xD;
heAring no scruples about eaves-dropping, I overheard&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
the coVersation that followed, and which I report as a&#xD;
sample of what my Uncle garret could do in the way&#xD;
of rapid, complete, versatile, plausible, and effective&#xD;
lying.&#xD;
"Not a bit dissatisfied, Abraham~ not a bit," said Mr.&#xD;
Van~ Horn, as he took his chair.&#xD;
"Well, then, why do you want to cast me oft'; e.h?&#xD;
I thought it was understood when pa was alive that&#xD;
~ and I were to stick together and keep up the old&#xD;
name and the old concern. Now, I don't think it's fur&#xD;
at all. If you don't think I've been active enough,&#xD;
why, I'll do anything; I'll"-.&#xD;
"But Abraham, I've no fault to find with you in any&#xD;
way - understand that. My reason for wishing to&#xD;
bring our business relations to a termination is solely&#xD;
this: you know very well that I have now acquired a&#xD;
J, fortune more than ample for all my needs and wants,&#xD;
and also that I have attained that period of life when it&#xD;
behooves me to devote the few remaining years that may&#xD;
be spared to me, to occupations and objects more befit-&#xD;
ting a Christian than mere money-getting pursuits. In&#xD;
view of this, I must proceed to wind up my affairs.&#xD;
The first; step to be taken, and I do it with very great&#xD;
reluctance, is to sever my connexion with you; not&#xD;
from any mercenary motive, nor from any dissatisfaction&#xD;
with you, Abraham; but simply as preparatory to my&#xD;
retirement. You will readily perceive this in its true&#xD;
light, and see that I cannot under the existing state of&#xD;
things give that attention which I ought to, to my relb&#xD;
gious and benevolent duties."&#xD;
"Well; but what am I to do, eh? What shall I do,&#xD;
oh?' If you break up the old concern, why, I shan't&#xD;

hardly know what to d~. Don't you see? That's the&#xD;
trouble. How am I to get ten or fifteen thousand&#xD;
dollars a year, oh ?" This was said in a querulous and&#xD;
vexed tone.&#xD;
"My dear Abraham," said Mr. Van Horn, softly, "I&#xD;
think, indeed I might almost call you my son, pray,&#xD;
listen to me. Although your share of the capital, that&#xD;
is to say, the money you have standing to your credit&#xD;
on the bodks, is not indeed as large as it might have&#xD;
been, still it is enough to satisfy any reasonable man.&#xD;
You must remember, Abraham,-J speak plainly-you&#xD;
must remember that you have been extravagant, and&#xD;
instead of accumulating you have spent all your income.&#xD;
I say this without any intention of reproaching you, but&#xD;
merely to-to elucidate my point. Yet, as I said, in my&#xD;
opinion you have an abundance, and isn't it better to&#xD;
grasp this and hold it fast, than to continue in business&#xD;
and perhaps lose it? Now-here I've a balance-sheet&#xD;
which I wish you to examine-there you see-you have&#xD;
- thousand dollars to your credit which I'm sure is a&#xD;
handsome sum, and can be invested so as to yield -&#xD;
thousand per annum easily and safely, and without an~&#xD;
exertion on your part. You will then be free fr~m any&#xD;
of the cares and troubles ,of business, and better still,&#xD;
have your money safe from any contingency. That is&#xD;
the great point, for you are well aware that our profits&#xD;
are much reduced this year. Cast your eye over this&#xD;
account 'Shipment to Porto..Bello;' and on this,&#xD;
'Cheroots,' and see the enormous losses we have sus-&#xD;
tained, and there is no knowing how things may turn&#xD;
out next year. Yes, I think in view of all this you must&#xD;
admit that prudence is the best course to pursue, and I&#xD;

82(            GARRET VAN HORN.&#xD;
think I have matured a plan which will prove the most&#xD;
advantageous method of closing the business, and&#xD;
bringing our accounts to a speedy settlement. For in-&#xD;
stance: your interest in the capital is so much-your&#xD;
share of the profits as pe~ Profit and Loss account-so&#xD;
much. Of merchandise on hand we have-so much, on&#xD;
the greater part of which we probably shall not lose&#xD;
anything. On the othei' hand the 'Suspended debts'&#xD;
account is-so much-a large sum as you perceive, and&#xD;
we have this 'Shipment of flour to Rio,' on which it is&#xD;
more than likely we shall lose at least fifteen per cent.&#xD;
Now, what I propose is this: that the whole business&#xD;
be transferred to you ;-that you take entire charge of&#xD;
everything, collect all debts, ii$fact, do everything that&#xD;
n~ay be necessary to lkiuidate the affairs of the firm in&#xD;
the promptest and most profitable manner; that you&#xD;
buy me out, as it were, paying me the half of my in-&#xD;
terest in the concern as it now appears on the books in&#xD;
cash, and for the other half, give me your bond with&#xD;
co1late~al security for its payment, say, in six and nine&#xD;
months. In consideration of your performing this you&#xD;
atre to have all the profits that may possibly accrue from&#xD;
the arrangement."&#xD;
"But how am I to raise the cash, eh? I couldn't&#xD;
scrape together so much money so soon; don't you&#xD;
see&#xD;
Mr. Van Horn saw very well, much clearer doubtless&#xD;
than Abraham did, but he simply said: "That of&#xD;
course is your own look-out. Now, if you prefer it, I&#xD;
will buy you out on the same terms. You see, I want&#xD;
above all to act squarely with you. I make no proposi-&#xD;
tion, nor do I wish you to enter into any arrangement&#xD;
&#xD;
GARRET VAN ItORN.        83&#xD;
&#xD;
in which I am not willing to take either side of the con-&#xD;
tract. I won't disguise the fact, that if you accept my&#xD;
first proposal you will have a great deal of trouble and&#xD;
annoyance; that it will take much time and toil, and&#xD;
that it may eventually turn out that the profits now&#xD;
appearing on the books will be consumed and end in a&#xD;
deficit. These of course are chances to take, But you&#xD;
have your choice; if you do not want to undertake it I&#xD;
will do so-pay you half cash, and balance in six months,&#xD;
fully secured, and run the risk of getting paid for my&#xD;
trouble put of what I can realize."&#xD;
"Suppose we let things stay as they are, eh? How&#xD;
would that do, you know-to wind up together, oh?&#xD;
Gradually, eb ~"&#xD;
"That is to say, that I must take the whole burden&#xD;
on my shoulders-do all the work and share the pay, if&#xD;
any, with iou? No, no, Abraham, that will never do.&#xD;
I could not in justice to myself consent to that. You&#xD;
must recollect, Abraham, that since we have been toge-&#xD;
ther the whole labor of carrying on the business has&#xD;
devolved upon me; the paltry three thousand a year&#xD;
extra allowed me as salary being no equivalent for my&#xD;
services, and merely a recognition of them. This can-&#xD;
not continue any longer. What I have offered you is&#xD;
the only just, fair, and equitable way, and I must have&#xD;
y~our decision at once, else we shall be obliged to adopt&#xD;
some other method which may prove neither profitable&#xD;
nor agreeable to either of us."&#xD;
"Well, well, Mr. Van horn," said Abraham; "if we&#xD;
must separate-why, one way, I suppose, is as good as&#xD;
another, eh? Don't you think so, oh ?"&#xD;
." To-morrow I'll have the wcessary papers drawn&#xD;

up, and we'll close the matter. Nothing like prompti~&#xD;
tude in business. Be here at one o'clock to-morrow."&#xD;
Mr. Van Horn, it will be noticed, omitted to mention&#xD;
the trifling matter of the expected cargoes, and so, as&#xD;
Abraham knew as little about accounts and the condi-&#xD;
tion of the business as he did about the doctrines of the&#xD;
Vedas, he concluded, as well as his wits would permit&#xD;
him, that the oniy thing to be done in this quandary&#xD;
was, as usual, to let Mr. Van Horn settle affairs as he&#xD;
listed.&#xD;
A few days later the firm was no longer A. Depoyster&#xD;
&amp;amp; Co., and Mr. Van Horn, by his adroit and opportune&#xD;
negotiation, succeeded in bagging a very handsome&#xD;
sum, which otherwise would have been shared with a&#xD;
useless and unworthy partner.&#xD;

CHAPTER VI,&#xD;
DOCTOR ROSE.&#xD;
~D now the immaculate six months, the irreproacha&#xD;
ble two hundred days of my existence have passed&#xD;
away-passed away, months and months ago, and I am&#xD;
now relapsed into my original sinfulness! The transi-&#xD;
tion was gradual and easy, for that condition of precise&#xD;
innocence, of rectilinear conduct and self-abnegation,&#xD;
was perhaps in me an abnormal one, and a continuation&#xD;
of it incompatible with my mercurial and ardent teni-&#xD;
perament.&#xD;
Thus my natural disposition resumed its sway, and the&#xD;
well-behaved, mild-mannei~ed, serious Bible scholar, back-&#xD;
slid into the pleasure-seeking unstable lad, and sad to&#xD;
i'elate, this change was chiefly brought about and kept&#xD;
pace with a disbelief in a once revered uncle; in Mr.&#xD;
Van Horn of the firm of A. Depeyster &amp;amp; Co., whom my&#xD;
father and a host of others looked upon as the sah of&#xD;

the earth; as a saint in spectacles; as one of the chosen&#xD;
and elect; ~s one in fact, who, if it came to that and&#xD;
sanctity were as potent as of yore, could save New&#xD;
York city and its suburbs from the fate that befell&#xD;
Sodom and Gomorrahi&#xD;
During the six months, more or less, of' my proba-&#xD;
tion, I, amongst other evil-ways, renounced novel-read-&#xD;
ing even to the extent of resigning Paul Clifford when&#xD;
three quarters read, which, as I had an insatiable appe-&#xD;
tite for romantic fiction, may be taken as a test of the&#xD;
strength of my good resolves. When I fell, or rather,&#xD;
glided back into my innate depravity, I resumed that&#xD;
pernicious habit and devoured the procilictions of Bul-&#xD;
wer, Le Sage, Scott, Cooper, and the other great novel-&#xD;
ists with a voracity truly appalling.&#xD;
Had this been my only fault but little harm would&#xD;
have accrued therefrom, and I might still have retained&#xD;
my uncle's good opinion, but unfortunately, my derelic-&#xD;
tion extended fi~rther. Among other sins of co~jnmission&#xD;
I formed, to express it elegantly, an attachment for a&#xD;
young lady. A lovely being of, say, scarce fifteen sum-&#xD;
mers, who, singular to relate, reminded me of all the&#xD;
heroines, of all the blonde heroines, I had ever read of in&#xD;
the pages of romance. Her orbs were cerulean, her&#xD;
curls golden, her name, Laura Ludlow! What I espe-&#xD;
cially admired in her was her goodness~-her moral&#xD;
excellence. She was such a kind, amiable, sweet girl,&#xD;
but alack! we were destined never to be one. It was&#xD;
all my aunt's fault, this fatal passion, and I suppose as ms&#xD;
usual in such cases it had its influence on my fLiture life.&#xD;
She never told her love, nor did I; we were too respectful&#xD;
for that; but there wns a tacit understanding between&#xD;
&#xD;
us to the same effect, which took the form of brotherly&#xD;
and sisterly affection. She was a Connecticut girl and&#xD;
niece of lNlrs. Van horn's, and came occasionally to the&#xD;
city to spend a few weeks with her aunt. She adopted&#xD;
me as her brother, and never, never was there such an&#xD;
affectionate sister! We went to church together, and&#xD;
to parties, but these, sad to say, were fruitful in quarrels,&#xD;
for MTC were as jealous as Italians and fickle as butterflies.&#xD;
In short, we were just as foolish as older lovers. Dear&#xD;
Aunt Jane with her ever-failing sagacity, foresaw at&#xD;
once ~that it would be a mach, and had Laura's bridal&#xD;
dress and cake all prepared in her mind's eye. When&#xD;
the charming girl returned to her Connecticut home she&#xD;
would pen to me epistles the most beautiful in style it is&#xD;
possible to conceive, full of the best advice and moral&#xD;
sentiments, all written in a neat minute hand on elegant&#xD;
note paper. A famous one, indeed, was Laura at "cor-&#xD;
responding," and lost no opportunity of displaying her&#xD;
talent in that line, whilst I responded in the best way I&#xD;
could, grateful for her tender solicitude in my welfare.&#xD;
Our loves had that extent and no more; but it necessa,.&#xD;
rily involved other aberrations on my part, such as&#xD;
a devotion to personal adornment, a hankering for&#xD;
rings, breastpins, and whiskers, much anxiety about the&#xD;
cut of my hair and troxvsers, and an insatiable Alexan-&#xD;
drine desire for conquest over the doomed sex. Con-&#xD;
sequently my savings were soon Spent and no more&#xD;
money found its way to my credit in the Savings Bank.&#xD;
Tired of evenings at home, I discarded my clarinet, and&#xD;
sought the companionship of congenial spirits, anti in&#xD;
couples or packs we hunted the fair, and ruthlessly ravaged&#xD;
the fluttering heart of beauty. Furthermore, ins~ad of&#xD;

&#xD;
going to church in a proper way and attentively listening&#xD;
to the sermon, we frequented houses of worship but to&#xD;
improve our taste in young ladies. The Tabernacle on&#xD;
broadway and Market-street church, were our favorite&#xD;
resorts for that purpose, the latter place being noted for&#xD;
the many lovely belles among its congregation. We&#xD;
young sprigs were the dismay and annoyance of sextons,&#xD;
who welcomed us with frowning brows, for we helped&#xD;
ourselves unceremoniouslyto. pews, and flung coppers on&#xD;
the platters at collection to create a noise and sensation.&#xD;
What a change from my quiet, sincere attendance on the&#xD;
teachings of the Rev. Dr. Westervelt at the old past&#xD;
Dutch church, which I now so carefully shunned!&#xD;
And to crown all, such a variety of new ideas and&#xD;
desires took possession of me, that my daily routine of&#xD;
clerkship became exceedingly irksome. Whilst I stood&#xD;
at the desk auditing accounts or copying letters, my&#xD;
mind was constantly roving from my task, and I would&#xD;
wonder how my uncle, with all his wealth, could be con-,&#xD;
tent to lead such, a monotonous existence when there&#xD;
were so many splendid things to be seen in the world,&#xD;
and so many pleasurable ones to do; he, who owned&#xD;
vessels going to all parts of the globe and who,, won-&#xD;
derful to say, had never been outside of the harbor!&#xD;
Then I would look across at the Sooloo, that lay&#xD;
opposite my window, and admire her clean, neat appear-&#xD;
ance, and imagine how pleasureful it would be to take a&#xD;
trip in her to that land ~f wonders C1hina, or to cruise&#xD;
about in that swift clipper the Dart, and participate in&#xD;
the romantic business of running opium. 0, those&#xD;

and disgust him with dull, plodding home-ways! Leave&#xD;
my present employment I would, at all hazards, sooner&#xD;
or later, with or without my uncle's permission and see&#xD;
the world, and the longer I was prevented from doing&#xD;
so the more dissatisfied I would be. I took no pains to&#xD;
conceal this feeling from my relatives, but, although my&#xD;
aunt was somewhat annoyed at my free expressions of&#xD;
discontent, my uncle seemed to take no heed of them&#xD;
whatever.&#xD;
One evening, while we were at tea, I remarked to&#xD;
him that I believed I never would he able to make a good&#xD;
clerk. "No, nor anything else useful, I am afraid," said&#xD;
my uncle, casting a look of contempt at a new acqua-&#xD;
marine pin that embellished my shirt-front.&#xD;
I was a little abashed at this answer, for fancying him&#xD;
in a complaisant mood, I was about entreating him to&#xD;
allow me to try a nautical life for a short time.&#xD;
"I think I might be useful at sea," I ventured. "I&#xD;
think I might make a sailor."&#xD;
"I doubt it," said my uncle.&#xD;
"Garry," exclaimed my aunt, "why, what are you&#xD;
thinking of? What a foolish notion. Have you any&#xD;
idea of the kind of life sailors lead? Don't you know&#xD;
they've nothing but hard biscuit and salt-meat to eat,&#xD;
and no butter nor delicacies of any kind, and they've to&#xD;
climb up thQ masts even in the coldest and wettest&#xD;
weather."&#xD;
I smiled at my aunt's attempt at dissuasion.&#xD;
"You will oblige me, G5retr," said Mr. Van Horn,&#xD;
drily, "' by banishing all such foolish whims. They&#xD;
might interfere with your occupations."&#xD;

What a pity that they should so soon dissolve into thin&#xD;
air, isn't . it ~ Garret has not experienced the bitter&#xD;
realities of life, but they'll come, sure and soon enough."&#xD;
The discussion was now dropped and the topic&#xD;
changed, but the unfavorable reception the announce-&#xD;
ment of my wishes had. met with, did neither quench&#xD;
them, nor shake my resolves in the least.&#xD;
A day or two after I met iDr. Rose in Wall street.&#xD;
lie appeared~ delighted to see me and shook my hand&#xD;
cordially. Said be: "You've so little amusement at&#xD;
your house that you certainly must find it lonesome.&#xD;
Come and see me, Garry-here's my card. Come any&#xD;
time, I'm almost always at home. Come this evening."&#xD;
I was pleased to find that such an agreeable man was&#xD;
disposed to be friendly with me, and thanking him for&#xD;
his invitation, I accepted it. On his card was written in&#xD;
pencil, No. --, North lJfoore street, and after supper I&#xD;
proceeded thither, for I liked the doctor, as he was&#xD;
always good-humored and full of fun, qualities that go a&#xD;
great way with young people.&#xD;

me into the doctor's room; a very shabby place for such&#xD;
an elegant man. But he had not practiced long and&#xD;
young physicians are proverbially poor. Presently I&#xD;

"Is there no hope ?" inquired I.&#xD;
"But little, I fear. These are the most trying things&#xD;
we have to bear in our profession-the scene of pro-&#xD;

away from there just as soon as I can."&#xD;
"And your uncle wants you to remain, is that it ?"&#xD;

not worth mentioning, particularly as all your uncle's&#xD;
wealth will eventually fall to you. Yes, Garry, I quite&#xD;

Here he was interrupted by the negro boy, who whis..&#xD;
pored in his ear.&#xD;
"Bid him come up, David4 It's only my tailor; sit&#xD;
still, Garry."&#xD;
A man of stubborn head and aspect stern, wearing&#xD;
very ill-fitting clothes, now entered with a folded paper&#xD;
in his hand.&#xD;
"Mr. Cook, sir," exclaimed the Doctor, rising to&#xD;
shake his hand. "How do you do, sir? I hope I see&#xD;
you well. David, bring the arm-chair for Mr. Cook-&#xD;
there-allo w me to take your hat, Mr. Cook. This ~&#xD;
Mr. Van horn, Mr. Cook. Mr. Van Horn, nephew to&#xD;
A. Depeyster &amp;amp; Co., you know-or rather, I should&#xD;
say, adopted son of Nabob Van Horn, senior, Garry,&#xD;
this is my friend Mr. Cook, the celebrated and dis-&#xD;
tinguished tailor and cutter to all the nobility and&#xD;
gentry, as tl~ey say in England, eh, Cook? Ha! ha !"&#xD;
The tailor relaxed his grim visage, and scanned my&#xD;
apparel from top~to toe.&#xD;
"Garry, you must be wanting clothes, eh? I can&#xD;
conscientiously recommend my friend Mr. Cook. You&#xD;
can't deal with a more worthy man or a more accom-&#xD;
plished artist."&#xD;
Mr. Cook, on whom the name of Van Horn had a&#xD;
perceptible effect, gave me his card and solicited my&#xD;
patronage.&#xD;
The doctor went to a closet and brought forth a&#xD;
decanter and some tumblers, "Cook, you'll take&#xD;
something, won't you? You must be tired after toiling&#xD;
all day. What's your particular.~a little Cognac 2"&#xD;
"Thank you, P11"&#xD;

"Excuse me, I 'never 4rink anjthing strong."&#xD;
"Pshaw! try a little."&#xD;
"I cannot," I began with a blush; for I saw the&#xD;
contempt in Mr. Cook's face.&#xD;
"What I you are not a teetotaller, I hope ?" ex-&#xD;
claimed the Doctor with a laugh. "There, drink&#xD;
that. It '11 not poison you, I'll be bound. Cook, my&#xD;
dear fellow, take some more. I can recommend tl~e&#xD;
stuff."&#xD;
I tasted the liquor aiid it set me a-coughing. Cook&#xD;
found it palatable, and its demulcent properties so molli-&#xD;
fied him, that he rose to leave without presenting his&#xD;
bill. "have a cigar before you go," said the Doctor,&#xD;
producing a box; "they're Noriegas. Garry, do you&#xD;
emok&amp;amp;? No, that's a pity. By. the by, Cook, I owe&#xD;
you a bill, don't 1? Let me see, to-morrow'S Wednes-&#xD;
day-.-next day's Thursday-.I'll call in tomorrow or the&#xD;
day after, and settle that."&#xD;
"If there's anything I detest," contiimed the Doctor&#xD;
to me after the tradesman's departure; "it's to have a&#xD;
man call twice for his pay. It's very ungentktnanly,&#xD;
and I must confess I feel a. little ashamed at putting&#xD;
Cook off; but unfortunately, he just happens to call at&#xD;
a moment when I have been paying out pretty heavily,&#xD;
and it's altogether unavoidable. While I think of it I&#xD;
must make a memorandum to call on him to~inorrow,&#xD;
or I might forget it. how do you progress with the&#xD;
clarionet, eh? I'm sorry you lost your little place there&#xD;
at the, organ. You were rather unfortunate about that.&#xD;
how furious Shaffer was, ha 1-ha! It won't do to fall&#xD;
asleep over music, G-arry. (The doctor wasn't aware&#xD;
that all the trouble arose from my being too wide-&#xD;
&#xD;
awake.) I suppose it's rather dull home, isn't it?&#xD;
Your uncle, to be sure, is a very estimable and worthy&#xD;
man; but, without meaning any disrespect, he is a very&#xD;
absurd one in some things. No~ but what he means&#xD;
well enough; but the truth is, that he has no more idea&#xD;
of the world beyond South street and the ~st Dutch&#xD;
church than a child. I may be mistaken, but I judge&#xD;
he is the last person on cartel to be entrusted with the&#xD;
destinies of a high-spirited young fello~~, except so far&#xD;
as regards furnishing him with plenty of money and&#xD;
that, there's no denying, he is~ fully capable of doing,&#xD;
ha !-ha !"&#xD;
"Capable enough," said I, "if he only had the in-&#xD;
clination."&#xD;
"But ho should have the inclination. It's the worst&#xD;
possible policy to stint a young fellow destined to conic&#xD;
into 'the possession of great wealth. lie should be&#xD;
habituated to the use of money. Otherwise, when he&#xD;
falls suddenly into the possession of a fortune, the&#xD;
chances are that he becomes so bewildered as to soon&#xD;
scatter away his dollars like an idiot."&#xD;
Of course, I acquiesced in this opinion, and decided that'&#xD;
the Doctor was a man of great good sense. After some&#xD;
more talk I left, more pleased than ever with this friend&#xD;
who had so warmly espoused my cause. Encouraged by&#xD;
his advice, I made another effort to obtain my uncle's con-&#xD;
sent to the wishes and plans that had now taken posses.&#xD;
sion of my mind, to the exclusion of almost everything&#xD;
else.&#xD;
"Uncle Garret, I should like very much to make a&#xD;
European tour," said I.&#xD;
"Indeed," said he.&#xD;

"Some day or other you may possibly go," said&#xD;
Aunt Jane.&#xD;
"Dr. Rose said he'd been to London and Paris long&#xD;
before my age," continued I.&#xD;
"Indeed," replied Uncle Garret.&#xD;
"And he says too, that he don't think it advisable to&#xD;
control a young man's inclination too strongly in the&#xD;
choice of occupations," said I, plumply.&#xD;
"The Doctor and I hold different opinions about&#xD;
that, it seems. When did he enlighten you on that&#xD;
subject, sir ?"&#xD;
"One evening last week."&#xD;
"Ah! And so the Doctor don't think it advisable to&#xD;
check youthful ambition, eh ?"&#xD;
"No, sir, he don't," said I, emphatically, wishing to&#xD;
impress him with the opinion of so valuable an auxili-&#xD;
ary.&#xD;
"I think the Doctor has done an unwise thing in up..&#xD;
holding you in such notions," said Uncle Garret.&#xD;
"I'm sure," interrupted Mrs. Van Horn, "that the&#xD;
Doctor never meant anything by it. He wouldn't, I&#xD;
know, do anything that you would disapprove of. He&#xD;
- may have given Garry a little advice, or Garry may&#xD;
have misunderstood him, or something of that sort;&#xD;
but I'm sure he's too kind-hearted a person to hurt any-&#xD;
body's feelings. Don't you remember, Mr. Van Horn,&#xD;
how he refused to eat lobster last Sabbath at dinner,&#xD;
because he said he wouldn't encourage the cruel way of&#xD;
cooking 'em,-that it was a relic of barbarism? Those&#xD;
) were his very words, and I've heard too, from Mrs.&#xD;
Robinson, that when he was walking out in the street&#xD;
with her, one day, he saw a vault-light open, and rang&#xD;
&#xD;
the door-bdll and told the folks of' the house how their&#xD;
carelessness might cause some poor persons to break&#xD;
their legs. That's kind, I'm sure."&#xD;
But Uncle Garret said iiothing further, and my second&#xD;
application for permission to rove, was as unsuccessful&#xD;
as the fb7st.&#xD;
And Myndert? I saw him but seldom now. Formerly&#xD;
we went frequently together to visit father, but after I&#xD;
became acquainted with Laura I neglected that laudable&#xD;
custom, and avoided my brother for more agreeable&#xD;
companions. When he came to see me I was never at&#xD;
home, and so, tired of calling he ceased, and at least six&#xD;
months had elapsed without my meeting him, when one&#xD;
evening, having nothing' better to do, I recollected&#xD;
having a brother in existence and went to visit him.&#xD;
He boarded in the family of Mr. Berg's foreman, who&#xD;
lived in Scan~mel street near the~ Dry Dock, but whe~ I&#xD;
reached there they told me that Myndert was not in and&#xD;
had probably gone to his draughting teacher's. Myn..&#xD;
dert inherited all his father's economical habits, and&#xD;
managed not only to clothe himself out of the small&#xD;
wages he receiX~ed, but also to save enough to pay for&#xD;
certain lessons and books necessary for a proper educa-&#xD;
tion in the scientific part of his trade. In spite of our&#xD;
low estimate of his mental abilities, he had brought&#xD;
away from school more solid and useful knowledge than&#xD;
his quicker-witted brother, and though slow to learn,&#xD;
what he did learn, he knew thoroughly and retained&#xD;
with great tenacity. Fiction satisfied my mental wants,&#xD;
but Myndert seldom read any of it; poetry he never&#xD;
appreciated, but he found after having laboriously mas-&#xD;

&#xD;
tered the rudiments of mathematics and entered into its&#xD;
intricate paths, temples of beauty and sources of rare&#xD;
pleasure. His studies were continued with Monsieur&#xD;
Thvois, who lived in the city, and with the assistance of&#xD;
this able teacher he was initiated into the arcana of the&#xD;
silence of ratios and quantities. Algebra opened the&#xD;
portals to a magazine of marvels, and his practical mimi&#xD;
found nutritious and delightful food in Geometry, that&#xD;
study noble in its elegant simplicity and truth.; and when&#xD;
able to grasp the higher branches of mathematics, such&#xD;
as Conic Sections and Calculus, he took absolute joy in&#xD;
abstruse problems, as much as any one could in a game of&#xD;
billiards. He exploded every stream that flowed from the&#xD;
fountain-head, not only those applicable to his profession,&#xD;
as Statics, 1-lydrodynamies, Architecture, etc., but also&#xD;
Astronomy, Geology, Mineralogy, and what not others,&#xD;
gathering and garnering as he went, priceless fruit from&#xD;
the tree of knowledge. He was fortunate in his choice of&#xD;
an instructor, for Monsieur Rivois was a complete and&#xD;
enthusiastic mathematician, who, of course, held classical&#xD;
learning in great contempt. The ancients, he would say,&#xD;
were well enough in their way no doubt, they had&#xD;
Archimedes, Apollonius, Csesar, and some others who&#xD;
were certainly men to be admired, but why waste years&#xD;
of study on Homer and Virgil? Would the ability to&#xD;
compose Greek sapphics and Latin hexameters enable a&#xD;
man to throw a substantial bridge over a stream or un-&#xD;
dertake a trianguk~tion? A reasoner and an analyst,&#xD;
above all, who lacked faith and accepted nothing save&#xD;
axioms and pal~abilLies, he held p'~e~s but as dreamers&#xD;
and idlers, and philosophers and metaphysicians, those&#xD;
profound thinkers lost in their own depths, those intellects&#xD;
&#xD;
run to seed, but as caged beasts who fret and chafe&#xD;
continually around their pen, seeking some aperture to&#xD;
escape into the world beyond. The man of numerals,&#xD;
however, sees at once the impossibility of escaping, or,&#xD;
in other words, that such problems as they propose are&#xD;
insolvable; that man's intellect is purposely limited, and&#xD;
that the wisest are but little clearer-eyed than simple-&#xD;
tons. How true this, and how insignificant all our great&#xD;
discoveries must appear to the eye of Omniscience;!&#xD;
Two inches or so in circumference, and a little more&#xD;
phosphorus, is all the difference between the brain or a&#xD;
Cuvier or Webster and that of an ordinary mortal.&#xD;
One lobe of that substance protrudes beyond the rest,&#xD;
and in that direction we excel, perhaps at the expense&#xD;
of some'~ other faculty, for even the greatest geniuses are&#xD;
deficient in some respects, and Shakspeare ~vas as inca-&#xD;
pable of painting like Raphael or of composing New-&#xD;
ton's Principia as the artist or the philosopher was of&#xD;
writing the tragedy of King Lear,&#xD;
A bit of this Frenchman's history would perhaps not&#xD;
be out of place here. Andr6 Rivois had served in an&#xD;
engineer corps under thp great Napoleon. He had lost&#xD;
an arm, gained the rank of captain, and been decorated&#xD;
for blowing up a bridge at some critical moment and&#xD;
sending a Prussian battalion flying in mid-air at the&#xD;
immindi~t peril of his life. After the reverses of the&#xD;
French and the occupation of Paris by the Allies, he&#xD;
was one. of those sullen Bonapartists who remained in&#xD;
the capital and sought every opportunity to avenge on&#xD;
the hated foreigner the defeat of their beloved chieftain.&#xD;
Fierce and gloomy, he wandered about the coffee-houses&#xD;
and garden~ in plain citizen's dress, and when he met&#xD;

some arrogant German or' Briton, some officer all swag-.&#xD;
ger and gaudery, he would elbow him or tread on his&#xD;
toes and thus provoke him to a duel. His object was&#xD;
then attained. Blades were drawn at Montmartre-&#xD;
and one-two-and the third! in the bosom of some&#xD;
enemy of France -and the Emperor. Two, three, four&#xD;
even, of the hated foes fell before the falcon eye and&#xD;
vigorous arm of Capitaine Rivois, when th6 departure&#xD;
of the allied troops frustrated his plan of annihilating&#xD;
them one by one. Then, scorniiig service beneath the&#xD;
banner of the Bourbon, Capitaine Rivois sheathed his&#xD;
sword and got married. He now took it into his head&#xD;
that the wine trade was the line of business best adapt-.&#xD;
ed to the capacities of an engineer of roads and bridges,&#xD;
and established himself at Bercy, where, in about two&#xD;
years he succeeded in sinking not only all his own&#xD;
money but much of that article belonging to other&#xD;
people. To crown his misfortunes his wife now died,&#xD;
leaving him an only daughter. But the old soldier did&#xD;
not despair and said stoutly, "I must take a bold ~tep to&#xD;
retrieve my losses. It must not be said that Andr6&#xD;
Rivois died in the debt of any one. I have yet some&#xD;
years before me, courage Rivois, courage my friend, I&#xD;
leave for the America, for New York in the United&#xD;
States of the America !"&#xD;
"To the America !" exclaimed his aged father-in-.&#xD;
law. "But at what art thou thinking, my dear; art&#xD;
thou crazy ?" And the old man sought an ancient&#xD;
geography of the year 1 v'-, and read: "Now York, a&#xD;
town settled by the Hollanders, who bought it of the&#xD;
savages." "Savages!' but Andr6, they will eat thee-&#xD;
they will surely eat thee !" and he shut the book with a&#xD;
&#xD;
warning shake of the head. But in. spite of the savages&#xD;
Rivois followed his bent and came to New York.&#xD;
There he found an old brother officer, who was em-.&#xD;
ploycci by the United States government to superintend&#xD;
the construction of some harbor fortifications. From&#xD;
this friend Rivois received employment, until he oh-.&#xD;
tamed the more lucrative situation of professor of&#xD;
French in a young ladies' seminary. By dint of stinting&#xD;
and hard labor he managed to make frequent remit-&#xD;
tances to his creditors in France, until at length he suc-.&#xD;
eceded in freeing himself entirely from debt. Then he&#xD;
sent for his daughter, who had been, left with her&#xD;
grand-.parents, and hiring humble lodgings in Hudson&#xD;
Street, the two lived together in all possible affection&#xD;
and contentment. It was this damsel Rivois, now a&#xD;
young lady of eighteen, who answered my summons and&#xD;
lighted me up to a third story room, the evening I went&#xD;
to seek my brother. Myndert was busy -with Monsieur&#xD;
Rivois over a lesson. Monsieur Rivois was a well-pro-.&#xD;
l)ortioned old man, erect as a halberd, and with a case-&#xD;
hardened frame and empty sleeve that bespoke the&#xD;
veteran. As I entered he rose from his chair and ex-&#xD;
claimed: "J~ens! It is Garr6. But how does it go?&#xD;
There b a long time that one has seen you. It is the&#xD;
brothaii~ of Mistair ~Van Horn ma petite. Garr6, per-&#xD;
mit me t6 introdweeze you. It is Mademoiselle An-&#xD;

The daughter, a little, pale-faced, tidy body, curtsied&#xD;
quietly and gave me a chair.&#xD;

roughed it, and learnt it by ear. I have taken the&#xD;
liberty, therefore, of altering this phraseology and pro-&#xD;
nunciation when necessary to a more intelligible style.)&#xD;
"Do you see," said Monsieur Rivois, "your brother&#xD;
and I, we were occupied with that famous Monsieur&#xD;
Monge. lie is a charming gar~on that Maindair truly,&#xD;
and he i~akes a progress, ali !" and he shrugged his&#xD;
shoulders and pressed his lips together as much as to&#xD;
say that the progress my brother was making was too&#xD;
excruciating and altogether inexpressible. "Maybe&#xD;
you will recall to yourself that when he left Mistair&#xD;
Crombees he was not arrived at the Equashuns Quad-&#xD;
ratics, and well, here he is now at this moment alto-&#xD;
gether well advanced in the Statique-it marches! and&#xD;
listen well, we do not go. at the grand gallop-he com-&#xD;
prehends that-do you see-as it must (comme ilfaut).&#xD;
And one must see his drawings linear-there-regard&#xD;
that-whilst Annette will bring some glasses, and we&#xD;
will take a little coup together in honor of your visit.&#xD;
Truly, I should like to see that gueux (beggar) of a Main-&#xD;
dair at the Ponts et chauss~es, or even at the School&#xD;
Polytechnique; he would make well his way, I respond&#xD;
£oi~it."&#xD;
Myndert smiled at his teacher's enthusiasm, while I&#xD;
examined a port-folio of linear drawings, comprising&#xD;
elevations of temples, diagrams, sections of three-deckers,&#xD;
sheer-plans, and other architectural designs not very&#xD;
interesting to non-professionals.&#xD;
"At present," said Monsieur Rivois, after helping me&#xD;
to a glass of claret, "you will have the goodness to&#xD;
converse with Mademoiselle whilst your brother and I&#xD;
~nish our little lesson."&#xD;

I asked Miss Aunette how long she had been~ in our&#xD;
country. Four years she answered, in little better&#xD;
English than her father used. How did she like the&#xD;
country? was of course my next question. Not at all&#xD;
at first, but now that she had become accustomed to&#xD;
our language, etc. etc., and had made some few acquain-&#xD;
tances, she was well enough contented. Then I said I&#xD;
supposed Paris was a finer city than New York. 0,&#xD;
yes! she exclaimed, and as I had touched upon a con-&#xD;
genial topic she grew quite communicative and enter-&#xD;
tained me with descriptions of the Tuileries~ the&#xD;
Champs E1ys~es, and the Bois de Boulogue, narrating&#xD;
also (quite innocently) her Sunday jaunts with grand-&#xD;
papa, uncle, aunt, and the bonue, to dine on the grass&#xD;
at Ro'rnainville. "Poor marnan has been dead a long&#xD;
while," added she, "and now I cannot go to Rare la&#xD;

silent for some moments until her father, having concluded&#xD;
the lesson, rallied us by saying that we seemed to get&#xD;
along famously well and confidentially together. "I was&#xD;
telling to Mr. Van Horn, papa," said Annette, "about our&#xD;
parties of Sunday at Rornainville, and " -&#xD;

Annette raised her face close to her father's and&#xD;
whispered some hurried~ words. lie kissed her foi~ehead&#xD;
saying, '%AThn-non--have no fear, my little one," and&#xD;
we left the house together.&#xD;
Myndert having a long distance to go would not ac-&#xD;
company us, and Monsieur Rivois and I walked down&#xD;
Hudson street to Chambers when the Frenchman said,&#xD;
"It is yet early, let us go to the Caf6 Brille and make a&#xD;
party of domijiocs, what say you of it?" I consented&#xD;
and turning into Warren street we entered a small&#xD;
French coffee-house not far from Broadway. ilardi&#xD;
were we seated at one of the marble-top tables when&#xD;
who should advance to meet me but Dr. Rose. I took&#xD;
his extended hand and introduced him to Monsieur&#xD;
Rivois. The Doctor spoke French, much to Rivois'&#xD;
delight who fancied he had found a compatriot. "No,&#xD;
Monsieur, I have not the honor to be a Frenchman,"&#xD;
said the Doctor, "but I spent a long time in France and&#xD;
I learnt to love the country-magnificent country, sir,&#xD;
magnificent. I presume Monsieur has served in the&#xD;
army, andj~as sacrificed that (pointing to Mons. Rivois'&#xD;
empty sleeve) te the glory of his patria ?"&#xD;
"capitaine du genie under the Emperor, at your&#xD;
service," answered Rivois with the old military emphasis.&#xD;
"Perhaps Monsieur will do me the honor to take some-&#xD;
thing with us&#xD;
"With pleasure," said Dr. Rose, "I come here&#xD;
from time to time to take the coffee, and I~ have re-&#xD;
marked Monsieur here several times. I am rejoiced that&#xD;
it has given me the occasion to make the acquaintance&#xD;
&#xD;
of an old soldier of the Empire. I must mark the day&#xD;
as the ancients did with a whiVe stone, or better still,&#xD;
celebrate it as we moderns do in degtistating a bottle&#xD;
of the best wine in Monsieur Pinchon's cellar. Come,&#xD;
what shall it be? Shall we try the Chambertia, favor-&#xD;
ite wine of the Emperor? aa~on I"&#xD;
"I7'la mo'sieu."&#xD;
"A bottle of Chambertin and of the best. Perhaps&#xD;
Monsieur the Capitaine has taken part in the glorious&#xD;
campaign of Italy ?"&#xD;
"No, Monsieur, I have not had that honor, but I was&#xD;
present at Austerlitz and decorated at Jena," replied the&#xD;
veteran with not a little pride.&#xD;
"While we are tasting this, might I ask of Monsieur&#xD;
le Capitctine how he had the misfortune to lose his&#xD;
arm&#xD;
"Certainly," and Mons. Rivois descTibed how, at the&#xD;
affair of the Vienna bridge, he was~ skirmishing with a&#xD;
grenadier who was trying to tickle him with the point&#xD;
of his five-feet clarinet, when a savage hulan galloped&#xD;
4&#xD;
up and without ceremony or even asking permission,&#xD;
made such a dash at him with his lance that he was left&#xD;
for dead on the field, hut luckily recovered with the loss&#xD;
only of a wing.&#xD;
"Glorious profession that of a soldier-glorious in-&#xD;
deed," said Dr. Rose. "What do you think of our&#xD;
young friend here, a young man of talent and capabili-&#xD;
ties; the adopted son of one of the wealthiest men in&#xD;
this city; a young fellow with-every capacity for enjoy-&#xD;

contemptible. Is that an existence for a man ?"&#xD;
"Not at all," said Rivois. "You have reason. The&#xD;
commerce deprives us of all noble sentiments. It should&#xD;
be left to the woman. There is but one career for a boy&#xD;
like you. To the devil with the fortune! There are&#xD;
better thing in the world than money. Tell your uncle&#xD;
that you ~e~ire to go to Veste-Pointe---tell him you&#xD;
have so niex~mbition-some heart! sacre-bleul he will&#xD;
soon see you have reason and then 'En avant, ]7anfan&#xD;
la Tul4~e! go ahead, my dear boy."' (With a flouri~sh&#xD;
as ~f leading a storming column.)&#xD;
"You see," interpolated Dr. Rose, "I would not re~&#xD;
commend anything of the kind to a poor man's son, but&#xD;
look at Garry's position: his uncle is worth millions-.-4s&#xD;
QU old man, who in the natural course of event&amp;amp; can&#xD;
only live a short time longer, and then, of course, all he&#xD;
has goes to Garry. Well, this uncle has not, nor never&#xD;
had any idea of what life is. lie spends all his days in&#xD;
grubbing like an old mole, and depriving himself of&#xD;
everything to amass wealth. That is kind of him, to be&#xD;
sure, for our friend Garry will enjoy it; so far, so good,&#xD;
but what I blame the old gentleman for, is his treating&#xD;
Garry like a child, absolutely like an infant. Garry's&#xD;
old enough and reasonable enough now to he treated&#xD;
with a little consideration."&#xD;
"Without doubt-without doubt. Come, i~iy boy,"&#xD;
said Rivois, slapping me on the shoulder like a recruit-&#xD;
ing sergeant, "we must serve the patria."&#xD;
Another change in life's kaleidoscope dazzled my&#xD;
&#xD;
boyish eyes! a vision of myself in uniform, a dashing&#xD;
cavalry officer, proud and graud in gold lace, spurs, and.&#xD;
clanging sabre!&#xD;
Rivois began to dilate on the advantages and glories&#xD;
of the profession of arms, accidentally omitting the tri.&#xD;
fling offsets of shattered heads, torn limbs, and other&#xD;
uncomfortable results of incisive steel and penetrant&#xD;
ball, until the bottle and his enthusiasm went out toge-&#xD;
thor. "Tiens! I was forgetting myself. I promised.&#xD;
my little girl to be at home by nine, and it is now eleven&#xD;
hours passed. How the time goes with the good.&#xD;
friends."&#xD;
The doctor drew his wallet to pay for the wine, when&#xD;
a friendly contest ensued between him and Rivois as&#xD;
to who should settle the score. "Pardon, Monsieur,"&#xD;
said the latter, "I cannot permit it. You have made&#xD;
me the honor to refresh yourself at my invitation, for&#xD;
the which I thank you. Garr6, come dine with us&#xD;
Sunday next with Maindair, what say you of it? And.&#xD;
you also, sir, I shall be charmed to see you. At four&#xD;
o'clock precisely. Come together. Gentlemen, I salute&#xD;
you. At the pleasure of re-seeing you."&#xD;
It being late, I hurried home, feeling rather nervous&#xD;
when I reflected how stringent my uncle was in regard&#xD;
to early hours being kept in his household, and how&#xD;
severely he looked upon any infraction of this rule~ I&#xD;
rang the door~bell very gently, very gently, twice or&#xD;
thrice, and luckily one of the servants being still up I&#xD;
stepped noiselessly off to my room felicitating myself on&#xD;
my escape. Very demure was I at breakfast the next~&#xD;
morning, but lTncle Garret took me rather aback, by&#xD;
saying: "Garret, you came hQme too late laat nights It&#xD;

was thirteen minutes of midnight. This will not do.&#xD;
You know my ideas on this subject. Al~a'espectable&#xD;
people are in bed by ten o'clock. There is no truer&#xD;
proverb than: Early to bed and early to rise, etc. etc.&#xD;
I never, knew a man to succeed who did not keep early&#xD;
and regular hours. Remember this."&#xD;
Next Sunda5r I went to North Moore street to accom-&#xD;
pany the doctor to Monsieur Rivois' little dinner. Said&#xD;
the doctor:&#xD;
"I had quite forgotten about that invitation, Garry.&#xD;
Fact is, I don't approve of this fashion of making Sun-&#xD;
day a day of feasting. These Frenchmeh, though, are&#xD;
sad heathen. I suppose we can't well refuse. What&#xD;
kind of a tabl&amp;amp;does the old man set? I hope, at least,&#xD;
that it is a clean one. There's the newspaper. I'll be&#xD;
with you in a moment."&#xD;
He brushed his hair and whiskers, tied his cravat&#xD;
anew, dusted his coat and hat, and off we started. Qn&#xD;
our way we met several groups of young women whom&#xD;
the doctor examined with the searching glance of a&#xD;
connoisseur. "Take a good look at the plump one in&#xD;
pink coming this way, Garry," said he.&#xD;
But I had not as yet acquired the nerve to stare long&#xD;
and steadily at a female facq, and the doctor perceived&#xD;
it, for he said with a smiling sneer that confused me-&#xD;
"What! you're not afraid? Bless your innocent soul!&#xD;
don't you know they love it? What do you imagine&#xD;
they wear finery for, eh? To please themselves?&#xD;
You're green, Garry, green as a seed leek, my dear&#xD;
boy."&#xD;
~Eousieur ~Rivoi~ answered our ring in person, but as&#xD;

&#xD;
I was about to shake hands with him he respectfully&#xD;
declined.&#xD;
"Pardon, Messieurs, Monsieur Rivois is in his apart-&#xD;
ment, I am simply his domestic. Messieurs, will you&#xD;
have the complaisance to mount the stairs."&#xD;
We ascended and were shown into an apartment&#xD;
which evidently served as Monsieur Rivois' bed-room&#xD;
and parlor. Here we found 1~Iyndert rea~g the works&#xD;
of Rivarol, the wit and essayist.&#xD;
"Monsieur Rivois will be here in one instant," said the&#xD;
mock footman. "lie is in this moment under the hands&#xD;
of his hairdresser, who is curling him the hair." Shortly&#xD;
after he reappeared out of an adjoining room, which&#xD;
judging from its effluent aroma, must have been the&#xD;
kitchen, with a white apron about him, a white cotton&#xD;
night-cap on his head, and a basting spoon in his hand.&#xD;
"Excuse me, gentlemen, I am the chief-of-kitchen.&#xD;
Monsieur Rivois is occupied of his toilet with his valet-&#xD;
de chambre; he will be at your service in one instant."&#xD;
He acted his part with an elastic drollery and relish of&#xD;
humor really diverting, although I, being unaccustomed&#xD;
to such jesting from a person of his age, hardly knew&#xD;
how to take it. Presently appeared Mademoiselle An-&#xD;
nette, attired in a dark stuff dress, silk apron, and white&#xD;
linen collar. She accosted us with a few pleasant&#xD;
words of welcome, and set about arranging. the dinner-&#xD;
table as briskly and tidily as if born to the business.&#xD;
After the soup was on the table, Monsieur Rivois was&#xD;
himself again, and appeared in close shaven face and a&#xD;
well brushed coat, with the red-ribbon of the Cross of&#xD;
honor in his button-hole. "I have to ask of you,&#xD;
gentlemen, thousand pardons for having made you wait,&#xD;

b~t figure to yourselves, that my valet took the liberty&#xD;
of going to the ball last night with, as of reason, my&#xD;
best clothes. This morning at ten o'clock, as of habi-&#xD;
tude, I ring-my man does not come-good-I ring&#xD;
again-same result-in fine I go see-my begg~ir of a&#xD;
valet had not yet arrived. Eleven o'clock rings, my man&#xD;
arrives, that is how I am in retard. In fine, what will&#xD;
you? It is one-of those little miseries inseparable from&#xD;
t~he grandeur and the riches. Come,- Mademoiselle&#xD;
will do the honors. lila petite, serve the pottage. Tiens /&#xD;
the soup is not so bad. One may even say that it i;5 a&#xD;
little chouette. I make my compliments of it to Mon-&#xD;
sieur the cook."&#xD;
Annette was delighted with her father's wit, and&#xD;
laughed at each s~dly with so good a heart that I could&#xD;
not refrain from joining in h~r merriment.&#xD;
"After the soup we must take a little coup," conk&#xD;
tinted Monsieur Rivois. "Tiens! I have forgotten&#xD;
the wine. My sommelier-bottlelair, you call him, I&#xD;
believe? My bottlelair discharged me last evening. I&#xD;
had the insolence to drink the best wine myself, and&#xD;
did not content inc with the ordinary. My bottlelair&#xD;
said lie could not suffer that, and I have quit him.&#xD;
Give me a candle, my daughter; I must descend and&#xD;
grope about the cellar after a bottle of the best. The&#xD;
which prefer you, gentlemen; some Macon., or some&#xD;
Chateau Margaux ?"&#xD;
"Why don't you send one of yorir lacqueys, or t e&#xD;
cook ?" said Myndert.&#xD;
"Dame! I am afraid that they would refuse me; we&#xD;
others people of quality, we are of such slaves to our domes-&#xD;
tics. All the same; Twill try to persuade the cook to go."&#xD;
&#xD;
GARRET VAN hORN.              111&#xD;
He returned the next moment with a bottle. "T am&#xD;
very angry, gentlemen, that I cannot find the Chateau&#xD;
Margaux; I know not where that rascal of a bottlelair&#xD;
has hidden it; I could only put the hand on the Medoc,&#xD;
Thus must we content ourselves with that; but hap-&#xD;
pily this bottle is an only daughter."&#xD;
"An only daughter; what's that ?" asked I.&#xD;
"We call an only daughter, unejille unique, the fe~v&#xD;
last bottles that remain of a stock of wine. Naturally&#xD;
they are the best. I hope this one will sustain its repu-&#xD;
tation."&#xD;
So merry and happy was Annette at her fiT~ther's wit,&#xD;
such as it was, that Myndert, the Doctor and I, caught&#xD;
the contagion, and of a surety never yet was a party&#xD;
gayer on as scanty materials.&#xD;
After the soup we had broiled salmon, then a roast&#xD;
fowl, and a stew made of the soup.~meat and spices,&#xD;
which I pronounced delicious, followed by a salad of&#xD;
lettuce and eggs. Monsieur Rivois applied himself to&#xD;
his dinner as if that meal were the sole object of his&#xD;
existence. lie said the ragout was rigollo, and that we&#xD;
owed it to the talent of Mademoiselle in the art culinary,&#xD;
the first and finest of the fine-arts; and that she was&#xD;
altogether a blue ribbon, which I supposed had some&#xD;
reference to the millinery business, and was mystified as&#xD;
to its connexion with preparing stews.&#xD;
The dessert consisted of the "four beggars," as An-&#xD;
nette called it, which beggars meant nuts, raisins, and&#xD;
figs. Afterwards Monsieur Rivois brought more wine&#xD;
on the table, and Dr. Rose proposed the health of the&#xD;
fair artist culinary, which we drank in our host's&#xD;
Medoc, which tasted to me like red lemonade without&#xD;

sugar, ~md finally, MoDsienr 1~hrois enlivened us with a&#xD;
song, one having a military theme:&#xD;
"Dit mol soldat, disait 'un capitctine," etc.&#xD;
singing it with a gPuff emphatic pathos which sadly&#xD;
marred the melody. Then Annette, who by this time&#xD;
had cleared off the table, at her Lather's request took a&#xD;
guitar and sang in a thin weak voice several romances,&#xD;
greatly to her father's delight, who exclaimed:&#xD;
"Brava I" at the end of each song, and applauded as&#xD;
if she fairly out-sans Malibran. "Has she not some&#xD;
voice? Has~she not some taste? Is it not well that ?"&#xD;
appealed the father.&#xD;
"Excellent," said Dr.. Rose~. "She has a charming&#xD;
voice."&#xD;
"If we were at Paris, I would send her to the ffon-&#xD;
8er~xeto~'e, for she has truly much of taste for the chant.&#xD;
All she needs is a little study and teaching for to be~&#xD;
come mistress of the art. I would guarantee her a suc-&#xD;
cess of the most brilliant. At present, shall we have ~a&#xD;
party of cards, what say you of it ?"&#xD;
"Excuse us, if you please," said Dr. Rose; "to-day&#xD;
is Sunday, and you probably know our ideas about that&#xD;
day."&#xD;
"It is true; I was forgetting you were not French.&#xD;
Annette and me, we make generally a game of piquet,&#xD;
or we play at dames to pass the evenings, as we retain&#xD;
the usages of our native land. Of the rest, I suppose&#xD;
that it is permitted to sing, thus, if you have no objec-&#xD;
tions, I will give you a song of Papa B6rangei ." And&#xD;
Rivois had hardly roared a stave of "A lions Ballet w'~&#xD;
p~u de compliancec" wheii two or three impatient&#xD;
&#xD;
thumps on tue ceiling - of the room below us struck&#xD;
silence to the heart of the Gallie bard. "chut !" said&#xD;
he, with his finger to his lips, and opening the door&#xD;
softly he listened on the landing. "It is Meesis Juns,&#xD;
my proprietress, do you see. She comes from arriving&#xD;
from the church, and I was forgetting again that we are&#xD;
not in France. Come, I have had wrong. It is just.&#xD;
One must respect the morals and customs of the country&#xD;
where one resides."&#xD;
The Doctor, to draw the old soldier out, broached the&#xD;
topic of the battles ofjNapoleon, and by a malicious&#xD;
remark of his in praise of thc English, provoked an out-&#xD;
burst of indignation from Rivois, who began pouring&#xD;
out, not vials, but, to follow the simile, .demi-johns of&#xD;
wrath oii the blond and perfidious heads of Brita~nia's&#xD;
sons. Who would have supposed that this viva~ions&#xD;
man, flashing like powder at a chance remark, could&#xD;
have been the one to keep a head cool and clear in the&#xD;
midst of bursting shells and thundering guns; that this&#xD;
man, amused with his own thin jests, had spent nights&#xD;
and nights in abstruse study, and could now acutely&#xD;
and unerringly pursue an analysis with the relish and&#xD;
persistence of a medieval alchemist. -Here is the error&#xD;
many make in estimating the French character, for-&#xD;
getting that light hearts may be allied to heavy brains,&#xD;
and that gravity no more betokens wisdom than gaiety&#xD;
does a shallow mind. Minerva's bird, the owl, is a&#xD;
stupid one for all its profound looks, and has not half&#xD;
the intelligence of a chattering parrot or magpie.&#xD;
Rivois' diatribes grew so loud and fierce that he was&#xD;
again interrupted by a repetition of the knocks on the&#xD;
ceiling, and the shrill voice of Mrs. Jones screaming out&#xD;

something about "Pagans," and "scandalous." This&#xD;
calmed the old Frank in a remarkable degree. "We&#xD;
speak too loud, do you see, for the Sunday. But I can-&#xD;
not never hear defended the conduct of those gredins&#xD;
of English and their allies falling on one nation. It is&#xD;
some poltroonery, do you see, like-like four against&#xD;
one."&#xD;
"I suppose," said I, " you believe France would have&#xD;
been a match for any two of them ?"&#xD;
"Without doubt, my boy, without doubt. We would&#xD;
have made them dance prettily to the sound of the&#xD;
cannon. But what will you-it is the fortune of war."&#xD;
The Doctor now suggested it was time to leave, and&#xD;
we took our departure, with an invitation from Mons.&#xD;
Rivois to come again and see them, "without ceremony,&#xD;
do you see."&#xD;
"lie's an amusing old chap in his way that French-&#xD;
man," said the Doctor as we were going home. "lie&#xD;
must owe his landlady two quarters' rent at least, I&#xD;
should say, from the dread he has of her. What a&#xD;
homely little witch his daughter is, and such squeaking!&#xD;
I coukt hardly keep from laughing in the man's face&#xD;
when he asked me if I didn't think she had voice. They're&#xD;
a set of vain beggars."&#xD;
"They're good-natured honest people I'll swear to&#xD;
that," said Myndert warmly. "They're poor to be sure,&#xD;
but what of it ?"&#xD;
"They may be honest enough," returned the Ddctor,&#xD;
"and good-natured enough, but that's no reason why&#xD;
they should poison' us with vile trash under pretext of&#xD;
dining us."&#xD;
"Why I thought the dinner was very nice," said I.&#xD;

"Nice! nonsense. Slip away from the office at about&#xD;
five to-morrow, and meet me at Coquelicot's and I'll&#xD;
show you what a nice dinner is. Come too, Myndert,&#xD;
if you can get away. I'll be glad to meet you also-"&#xD;
Myndert, could not come but I was present, punc-&#xD;
tually enough, and what a feast we had! In my inno-&#xD;
cence I had never imagined that such dishes and dainties&#xD;
were possible. Not the remotest idea had I of what the&#xD;
dinner was composed, but it was delicious, and we eat&#xD;
and eat, and we drank and drank, at least I did, over-&#xD;
much of sparkling Sillery, ~o that, bottle-valiant, I re-&#xD;
plied to the Doctor when he asked what I thought my&#xD;
uncle would say if he could see me carousing thus, by an&#xD;
answer equivalent to my not caring a tinker's anathema&#xD;
about it. I said that, snapping my fingers too, with&#xD;
such scornful defiance that the Doctor chuckled greatly,&#xD;
and said, Good boy! And when the dinner was over&#xD;
he asked me if~ I would like to go to the theatre. Of&#xD;
course I would, and we went. My recollection is very&#xD;
misty about the play. There were ladies and gentlemen&#xD;
with brilliant complexions and he-spangled clothes on&#xD;
the stage, and from the audience caine long peals of&#xD;
laughter and clapping of hands, but after an act or two&#xD;
I was so be-dazed and hot with the glaring gas-lights&#xD;
that we went into the street for fresh air. The Doctor&#xD;
walked me about to cool my inflamed blood, and gave&#xD;
me a cigar to counteract the xvine which it did effica-&#xD;
ciously, for when I reached home about midnight I was&#xD;
in a told sweat and had hardly strength enouo'h toning&#xD;
the door-bell. Aunt Jane glided down in her night-&#xD;
dress to admit me. "Mercy! Garry, where have you&#xD;

Early the next morning Aunt Jane brought me a cup&#xD;
of tea. She found me sleeping off the debauch, but I&#xD;
awoke soon after and instead of going to the breakfast&#xD;
table and meeting my uncle, I went directly to the office,&#xD;

~ my intercourse with Dr. Rose he had sowed&#xD;
seed in my mind which soon germinated and bore&#xD;
a baneful flower. That poison-flower was the dangerous&#xD;
idea that I was destined to inherit my uncle's wealth,&#xD;
and this idea he never failed at every opportunity to&#xD;
impress upon me. Mr. Van Horn, it must be said, had&#xD;
never given me the slightest intimation to warrant any&#xD;
such expectation, for it was part of his cautious charac-&#xD;
ter to avoid, as far as possible, making promises of any&#xD;
kind; his wi e, however, kind, irreflective Aunt Jane&#xD;
had assert to my father on several occasions that I&#xD;
was looked upon as their son and presumptive heir.&#xD;
Yet I had given no attention to this, for I was indiffer~&#xD;
ent to such a probability and untainted with any greed&#xD;
of money, until the Doctor, by his repeated ~nd insidious&#xD;
congratulations, awakened in me the enervating thought&#xD;

that unearned riches and a life of luxury were to be&#xD;
mine. What youthful nature could withstand such a&#xD;
belief and not fall into sloth and pernicious dreams of&#xD;
the future? Stronger will were needed than mine t6&#xD;
continue self-reliant and ambitious of achievement be-&#xD;
neath that evil spell and blight of life, the expectation&#xD;
of a fortune.&#xD;
And the plant of the Doctor's sowin ~p~ew and grew&#xD;
like the noisome weed it was. I became vain of my&#xD;
position and indulged in brilliant visions of the future.&#xD;
My uncle's admonitions to diligence, and economy seemed&#xD;
absurd in the extreme. I loathed more than ever the&#xD;
monotonous life he intended me for, and his measures&#xD;
towards one destined to an oPulent heritage appeared&#xD;
even tyrannous.&#xD;
And now that I had gotten a taste of what the world&#xD;
had in store, I was more restive, more discontented than&#xD;
ever. The painful termination of my little dissipation&#xD;
with Dr. Rose did not deter me from similar pleasures.&#xD;
I was tired of evenings at home and eager for nocturnal&#xD;
rambles. Dr. Rose encouraged me In this, and often&#xD;
gave me tickets for the theatre. The theatre! what&#xD;
would Deacon Van horn have said to that? How&#xD;
could he have slumbered undisturbed while his graceless&#xD;
nephew was kicking his heels in a temple of Satan, even&#xD;
in the pit thereof? a devotee of the wicked play-folks,&#xD;
held in thrall by their brazen antics, their gaudery, and4&#xD;
their wanton songs! Fortunately for his peace of mind&#xD;
he never discovered this extent of my demoralization,&#xD;
for I had a convenient way of effecting my ingress to&#xD;
the house, at late hours, without ~he knowledge of the&#xD;
inmates. This was my stratagem: our house stood on&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
[&#xD;
&#xD;
a corner lot with a stable, on the rear, fronting the side&#xD;
street; between the house and the stable ran a short&#xD;
wall crowned with spikes; there was a small door, how-&#xD;
ever, in the wail, the bolt of which I could draw from&#xD;
the outside by a simple sleight; onc9 inside the yard I&#xD;
could, by climbing on the veranda, open a small oval&#xD;
hail window and then drop on the landing of the back-&#xD;
stairs. Hardly ~a niglA passed that I did not avail&#xD;
myself of this method to enter. It required a little&#xD;
caution and expedition so as not to attract the attention&#xD;
of the watchmen, who, however, were not very vigilant,&#xD;
and in this way I enjoyed the liberty of roaming at will,&#xD;
happy and eager as a hound loosened from the leash. I&#xD;
frequented billiard saloons, bowling alleys, and oyster-&#xD;
cellars, but my favorite resort was the playhouse. The&#xD;
old Park in the days of Power, Fisher, and the Placides.&#xD;
We shall never see such acting again, for the race of&#xD;
English actors is fast dying out. And the National with&#xD;
Wallack and the opera; and the little Franklin with&#xD;
John Sefton's "Veil vot ov it?" What a paradise to&#xD;
me was that canvass architecture and tinsel splendor!&#xD;
They bring no such enjoyment now; wiser with age the&#xD;
illusion is too transparent.&#xD;
All at once my facility for clandestine entrance to&#xD;
the house was interrupted. To explain this it will be&#xD;
necessary to introduce an episode which may also serve&#xD;
to illustrate Mr. Van Horn's love of order, for he had&#xD;
an unbounded belief in system, and it was a standing&#xD;
rule with him never to give trust or credence to any&#xD;
man who lacked this essential to success. The follow-&#xD;
ing will show how completely he had subjected himself&#xD;
to its practice. Called away, one afternoon, by an&#xD;

easiness, and began to toss restlessly about. Something&#xD;
serious evidentlyy disturbed his mind. Perh~tps a pre-&#xD;
sentiment of some calamity to the firm? Was failure&#xD;
imminent? Nay, the trouble was simply this:&#xD;
now recollected having left his office without wiping his&#xD;
pen, closing his inkstand, or locking up some important&#xD;
papers; in short, leaving his desk in that confused con-&#xD;
dition ,so detrimental to the prosperity of a mercantile&#xD;
house. He tried to argue himself into the belief, that&#xD;
the porter would not have closed the office and left his&#xD;
desk in that slovenly state. But to no purpose. If the&#xD;
master were careless, could the man be otherwise?&#xD;
And what a pernicious example to set before his clerks!&#xD;
Vei'ily, as he had committed the fault it were but meet&#xD;
he should rectify it. He would arise and go forthwith.&#xD;
Mrs. Van horn vainly endeavored to dissuade him from&#xD;
his intention. "At least," said she, "let Dennis go&#xD;
with you." "It is not worth while," he replied; "I&#xD;
will be* nearly there before I could awaken him, and&#xD;
back by the time he were dressed." So Mr. Van Horn&#xD;
took the keys-they were always left at the house&#xD;
every evening by the porter-wrapped himself up and&#xD;
proceeded at near midnight to South street to arrange&#xD;
the objects of his solicitude. This accomplished to his&#xD;
great relief, he set about returning, when he heard, as&#xD;
he descended the stairs, a watchman's rap on the kerb-&#xD;
stone, and had hardly reached the street when he&#xD;

0-ARLIET VAN HORN.&#xD;
&#xD;
121&#xD;
&#xD;
received a smart blow on the head from a club, and&#xD;
found himself roughly seized bj a watchman, who ex-&#xD;
claimed ;-." Surrinder! ye willing, or I'll break ivry&#xD;
bone in yer body. Ow, ye thundrin' thafe, I've got ye&#xD;
at last, have I ?"&#xD;
Stunned for the moment, Mr. Van Horn 'was unable&#xD;
to offer any explanation, and two other leatherheads&#xD;
approaching he was dragged off by the trio to the&#xD;
watch-house. here the captor vauntingly narrated his&#xD;
exploit to the captain: "Ow, and a disprit willing he is&#xD;
shure. He fought like a murtherin rasheal, and strict&#xD;
at me wid a knife, the which I knocked dane out&#xD;
ov his hand wid me stick. For tin minits me loife&#xD;
wasn't wurt a pin, until I got the bist ov him, and&#xD;
brought him to instinct sulimission wid a clip ov me&#xD;
stickk"&#xD;
Mr. Van Horn was at first disposed to forgive the&#xD;
assault in consideration of his suspicious position, but&#xD;
disgusted at the lying of the patrolman he asserted&#xD;
rather sternly, that he was taken from his own premises,&#xD;
and that his accuser was a complete liar.&#xD;
"Oney 'ear un! bedad it's the same man I've biii&#xD;
lukkin for these three moi~ths and more; the same chap&#xD;
as bruk inter Murphy's porter-house, and shaved him&#xD;
ov fore-and-twinty dolh~rs, and half a pipe ov gin."&#xD;
"Wbat's your name and occupation ?" interrogated&#xD;
the captain.&#xD;
"Mr. Van Horn I'm a merchant doing busi-&#xD;

"Ear 'im agin! Heez name's Van Horn, is it? Be-&#xD;

&#xD;
." Silence! Mr. Van Horn, how came you at your&#xD;
store at this time o'night ?"&#xD;
My uncle's explanation of his simple errand was&#xD;
received with a smile of incrcdulity, and served hut to&#xD;
strengthen his accuser's charge; accordingly, he was&#xD;
forced to spend the remainder of the night in the com-&#xD;
pany of several unclean rogues, and to console himself&#xD;
with, the thought that he was enduring martyrdom&#xD;
for his devotion to heaven's first law, until morning&#xD;
brought friends to establish his innocence, and effect his&#xD;
release.&#xD;
Meanwhile, a robbery had actually been perpetrated&#xD;
in Mr. Van Horn's dwelling, and on returning home he&#xD;
was astonished to find his wife in great trepidation,&#xD;
occasioned not only by his prolonged absence, but also&#xD;
by the discovery that during that time some one had&#xD;
penetrated to their bed-room, and stolen a pair of dia-&#xD;
inond ear-rings, which the thief had selected, leaving,&#xD;
singularly enough, other jewellery untouched. Mrs.&#xD;
Van Horn was much grieved by her loss, for the missing&#xD;
articles were very costly ones, and it was pitiful to see&#xD;
into, what a state of nervous, trembling, tearful agita-&#xD;
'tion she had been thrown by the occurrence. The&#xD;
police were apprised and other measures taken, but no&#xD;
clue whatever could be obtained to indicate the robber;&#xD;
however, the horse being stolen the stable was now to&#xD;
be most carefully locked, and the following night an&#xD;
elaborate system of barricading was instituted through-&#xD;
out the house. Bolts and ,bars were in requisition, a&#xD;
mastiff ~~as procured, Uncle Garref betook him to&#xD;
deadly weapons, and Dennis slept like a bandit guarding&#xD;
booty with the plate-basket under his pillow, a carving~&#xD;
E&#xD;
&#xD;
knife in his hand, and an axe by his bed-side. in this&#xD;
way my convenient method of entering the house by a&#xD;
rear-window was obstructed, for IL had no notion of&#xD;
'exposing myself to Dennis' zeal, and being pitilessly&#xD;
slain for a burglar. This state of things lasted for&#xD;
almost a week, and then the household relaxed its vigi~&#xD;
lance. The watch-dog was summarily discharged, as he.&#xD;
exhibited an illicit passion for chops and tender-loin&#xD;
steaks. Dennis disarmed himself; the carving-knife&#xD;
was restricted to its inglorious duty of gashing cooked&#xD;
flesh, and all resumed its wanted tenor. The coast&#xD;
being again clear II resumed my rambles by night, and&#xD;
pursued my endeavors to "see life." One day, Jerry&#xD;
Teed, the Custom-house clerk, asked me to go with&#xD;
him to a cook-fight about to come off that very night.&#xD;
Jerry's cousin was bar-tender where the inspiriting per-&#xD;
formance was to take place and in this way we would&#xD;
have no difficulty in being admitted. What lively lad&#xD;
would not have been delighted at such an opportunity?&#xD;
and so, instead of going home to tea, Jerry and II took&#xD;
supper at the "Terrapin Lunch," before starting for&#xD;
the scene of action. We had fried oysters, I recollect,&#xD;
egg-nogg, and Scotch ale. The egg-nogg loosened&#xD;
Jerry's toug~ie. "Old man's deuced stingy, ain't he,&#xD;
Garry? Wish~. he'd raise my wages 'stead o' sub-&#xD;
scribing to all them societies and churcL~s. How does&#xD;
he keep you up at the house, eh, Garry? Close, eh ?"&#xD;
A' Oh no," said I with some importance, "J do pretty&#xD;
much as I like."&#xD;
"I guess he'll leave you a sight o' money when he&#xD;
dies, won't lie ?"&#xD;
"IL dont know, maybe."&#xD;

"You're in for some, 1 11 bet a big-apple, if he don~t&#xD;
leave it all to religion. I wish I had your chance any-&#xD;
how. The old man's got a frightful heap. Who wouldn't&#xD;
if they was as mean as he is? Won't there be a scram-&#xD;
ble when he goes off the hooks! I'll tell you what,&#xD;
there'll be rousing fun 'bout them days. How's your&#xD;
turnip ?"&#xD;
I pulled out my old plethoric timepiece that, as&#xD;
befitted one advanced in years, kept more regular hours&#xD;
than those flat finniken lepines of modern days, and told&#xD;
him it was h~4f-past eight.&#xD;
"'Bout time we was off," said Jerry. "Fun don't&#xD;
begin till late, but we'd better be on hand early. Waiter,&#xD;
what's the expense ?"&#xD;
He called the waiter and I paid him.&#xD;
Off we trudged through Chatharn Square and up the&#xD;
J3owery; smoking cinnamon cigars, and discussing the&#xD;
relative merits of Tom Hamblin and Jim Wallack, until&#xD;
we arrived at a tavern called the "King-Pin House,"&#xD;
situated in one of the eastern avenues.&#xD;
Jerry was apparently well acquainted here as he nod~.&#xD;
ded to the landlord, and introduced me to his cousin,&#xD;
the bar-keeper, whom. he called "Chris." To cement&#xD;
the bonds of new-m~de friendship I could do no less&#xD;
than invite Chris to join Jerry and ~ne in a social&#xD;
glass. Then Jerry stood social glasses all around, and&#xD;
then Chris, not to be outdone, also stood social glasses,&#xD;
and with three social glasses aboard, to say nothing of&#xD;
the ale and egg-nogg, I paid the admission fee, went&#xD;
through a narrow passageway into a back-yard and&#xD;
down some stone-steps into a cellar. Here was the cock-&#xD;
pit, surrounded 'by an amphitheatre of rough benches&#xD;
&#xD;

and lighted by many tallow-candles stuck in tin sconces.&#xD;
Along the walls were coops of cocks, eager for the fray,&#xD;
and crowing defiantly at each other. There were but&#xD;
few persons present as yet, and these were gathered in&#xD;
one corner around a sweaPeloth gambling for coppers&#xD;
and sixpences. We watched the play for some moments&#xD;
when, as a prelude to the evening's entertainment, a&#xD;
black boy struck up the then popular song of "Sitt6n&#xD;
on a Rail," after which he danced a "breakdown" with&#xD;
a glass decanter~ poised on his woolly head, and conclu-&#xD;
ded by stretching open his large mouth and catching the&#xD;
coppers showered at him in that amazing cavity.&#xD;
As soon as the place was filled the serious business&#xD;
began. Blacklegs, stablemen, butchers' apprentices, and&#xD;
some countrymen composed the assemblage. Jerry and&#xD;
I secured seats on the front row of benches. Opposite&#xD;
to us sat several young men in red-flannel shirts orna-&#xD;
mented with pearl buttons. One, who wore white&#xD;
braces with a leather engine-number and name "Gqod&#xD;
intent" on his back, began whistling at me. His com-&#xD;
panions laughed, and cried, "Carlo! Carlo !" and the&#xD;
Good-Intent boy said I owed the barber a shilling. For&#xD;
these gall ant youths, it seemed, were displeased at my&#xD;
mode of wearing the hair, it being the fashion in thQse&#xD;
days for "Volunteers" to crop the hair at the back of&#xD;
the head and wear it long in front with greased side-&#xD;
locks, whereas, my hair being long behind and my shirt&#xD;
a white one, I was justly amenable to their censure, and&#xD;
thought it best to retire to a less conspicuous seat.&#xD;
Two cocks with trimmed feathers, cut combs and&#xD;
wattles, and armed with needle-gaffs, were put into the&#xD;
pit. Firm and square they stood-.vigilant and vindic-&#xD;

tive-then sparred, feinted, dodged, and struck like any&#xD;
gladiator. Pluckiest of animals they fought till their&#xD;
white hackles were all crimson, their little vivid eyes&#xD;
pecked out, and falling exhausted, rose again, staggering&#xD;
and blind, to deal thrusts even with their last heart's&#xD;
throb! Then the dead bird was flung ignominiously&#xD;
out and fresh ones introduced, and so the sport con-&#xD;
tinued, while bets and challenges were bandied about&#xD;
among the spectators around the pit. Finally a dis-&#xD;
pute arose; a pugilistic butcher having lost a wager&#xD;
refused to pay on the score of unfair play, which led to&#xD;
some derogatory expletive from the winner. At this&#xD;
the butcher swore he had a "Domnick" hen that could&#xD;
lick the other's main of cocks and their owner to boot.&#xD;
The other forcibly expressed his doubts as to the feasi-&#xD;
bility of that feat even if assisted. by a brace of~ swin-&#xD;
dling butchers, whereupon the butcher, as an experiment,&#xD;
delivered a "hot one" on the other's "fly-trap," which&#xD;
drew forth a rejoinder of blows, and then pell-mell the&#xD;
friends of each combatant were drawn into the scrimmage&#xD;
and a battle-royal ensued. As I was trying to avoid the&#xD;
row the Good-Intent boy, who had been so right-&#xD;
eously offended at the cut of my hair, approached me&#xD;
and inquired in ~an aggressive tone who I was looking&#xD;
at? Before I could frame a suitable reply to his ques-&#xD;
tion, he dealt me an intercostal punch, pegged away a~&#xD;
i~y profile, and knocked me supine, all in the short space&#xD;
of five minutes. For another five minutes I lay uncer~&#xD;
tam if I were an entirety or lying about dismembered,&#xD;
until Jerry shook me to rights and lugged me in to Chris,&#xD;
who rubbed my head with brandy, poured some down&#xD;
my throat, and held ice to my eyes. I was in a woful&#xD;

&#xD;
127&#xD;
&#xD;
plight. Bruised, bloodied, coat ripped up the back, fat&#xD;
watch gone, and beaver hat crushed into a dirty poly-&#xD;
gonal object. The quantity of vile liquor they had made&#xD;
me swallow, almost drove me crazy, and I insisted on&#xD;
seeking the Good-Intent boy, and demolishing his be-&#xD;
nevolent head. It was with much difficulty that Jerry&#xD;
could induce me to forego this intention and drag me&#xD;
homeward, while I staggered along sparring away with&#xD;
vengeful energy at imaginary "Good-Intents." Arrived&#xD;
at the house, Jerry slipped ofi leaving me fumbling&#xD;
in vain for the bell-pull. At last, b~ilnful of valor and&#xD;
unawed by any consideration, I began to kick and&#xD;
thump madly at the door. The racket was such as to&#xD;
awaken the household and down caine Dennis followed&#xD;
by Mr. and Mrs. Van Horn. "Who's there?" shouted&#xD;
Dennis, a little alarmed. No answer, but a thump on&#xD;
the side-light which shivered the glass to bits. ~" Who's&#xD;
there ?" again bawled Dennis, and he swung open the&#xD;
door causing me to land face down on the hall floor.&#xD;
"Mercy on us !" exclajmeit Aunt Jane, "it's Garr~t !"&#xD;
Dennis lifted mc,~aid 2ere I stood, steadying myself&#xD;
against the ~v lHn the foggy idea that there was a cata-&#xD;
strophe somewhere. Fancy my figur~ with a rimless&#xD;
hat, hal' wet and straggling, and a swollen nose looking&#xD;
if bedaubed with raspberry jam!&#xD;
"how came you in such a condition, sir? What has&#xD;
happened, sir ?" said my uncle, sternly.&#xD;
"Had little mis-inissunderstandin.---oney littl' mis-&#xD;
understandin,-.~--. that's all-little inissunder "-&#xD;
"Where have you been,, sir, at this time of night ?"&#xD;
"Cock-cock-fight," said I.&#xD;

- sternation and disgust as his immobile fcatilres could&#xD;
express.&#xD;
"Cock-fight !" said my aunt in the accents of despair.&#xD;
"0 Garry, why didn't you stay at home and practise&#xD;
your clarionet ?"&#xD;
"No-no-not cock-fight," said I with a vague notion&#xD;
that I had put my foot in it. "The-ayter--theayter."&#xD;
"The-ayter !" almost groaned my uncle, more dis.&#xD;
gusted than ever.&#xD;
"The-ayter !" echoed my aunt; "0 Garry-Garry!&#xD;
what will become of you ~"&#xD;
Had a bolt from heaven struck me dead at that instant&#xD;
I doubt if Uncle Garret would have been surprised. He&#xD;
would have viewed it solely as a just retribution for my&#xD;
heinous offence. No further questioning was needed&#xD;
after my last avowal, and Mr. and Mrs. Van horn&#xD;
returned to their room in the full conviction that I was&#xD;
in the grasp of perdition; while poor I, with a bewil-&#xD;
dered idea of not having mended matters by my expla-&#xD;
nations, was led up stairs by Dennis who pulled off my&#xD;
boots and put me to bed.&#xD;
For a week or so after this unfortunate occurrence I&#xD;
was forced to peep to my room, and carefully avoided&#xD;
meeting Uncle Garret, until my features being restored&#xD;
to a reputable appearance, I went meekly to the count-&#xD;
ing-room and applied mysel? with great seriousness to&#xD;
work. Ere long, however, Mr. Van horn accosted me&#xD;
with a request to walk into his private office, as lie&#xD;
wished to say a few words to me: I obeyed, very&#xD;
reluctantly, expecting a severe reprimand and perhaps&#xD;
a dismissal. He closed the door.&#xD;
"Sit down."&#xD;
&#xD;
GARRET VAN HORN.&#xD;
&#xD;
129&#xD;
&#xD;
I did so with about the same feeling one takes a seats&#xD;
in a dentist's chair,&#xD;
M~ uncle took off his spectacles,.-a habit he had when&#xD;
he intended to be more than usually impre~sive,-~--.and&#xD;
began: "I am not going to scold you. I am not going&#xD;
to tell you how much surprised, and how much more&#xD;
pained I was on seeing you in the shameful condition&#xD;
you were in on that unfortunate night. II feel I cannot. I&#xD;
am incompetent to deal with such a case, but I know&#xD;
that you have acquired vile habits and evil associations&#xD;
which may prove your ruin. I have consulted with 1~he&#xD;
Rev. Dr. Westervelt and laid your case before him, and&#xD;
we have come to the conclusion that the only way to&#xD;
arrest you on your headlong career to destruction is to&#xD;
sever you at once from the degrading temptations that&#xD;
abound in i~his large city. Now tell me; do you still&#xD;
wish to try a seafaring life ?"&#xD;
"I do, sir," I answered, much relieved i4 this unex~&#xD;
pected turn in the conversation.&#xD;
"The Splendid sails in a few days, Saturday at the&#xD;
farthest. If your father consents, I will speak to&#xD;
Captain Widdie and procure you a berth on board,&#xD;
before the mast. Captain Widdie is a very respectable&#xD;
and pious man. The ship is a temperance ship, and an&#xD;
orderly and a comfortable one. There you will have&#xD;
* time for sober reflection which I hope will have a bene-&#xD;
ficial effect. You have not much time to prepare. Go&#xD;
at once to Jersey-I will write a note to your father&#xD;
explaining matters. Then return as speedily as possible&#xD;
and go to Jewell's in Cherry street, near the market.&#xD;
Let them fit you out with a chest, stout clothing, and&#xD;
whatever things may be necessary, and tell them to send&#xD;

&#xD;
the bill to inc. Before doing that, however, you had&#xD;
better return here 'and sign the shipping articles."&#xD;
I left the office, crossed the Courtlandt-street ferry to&#xD;
Jersey City and walked to Communipaw, with my heart&#xD;
fi~ll of mingled pleasure and sadness. It was a dull, leaden,&#xD;
November day, and the more clearly imprinted on my&#xD;
mei~ory from its being the last on which I ever saw my&#xD;
father, and such melancholy visits are not easily forgot~&#xD;
ten. The little spot that shone so bright and green in&#xD;
the summer landscape seemed now struck by desola.&#xD;
tion. The salt-marsh stubble was sere and yellow,&#xD;
dotted here and there with a tawny stack; the waters&#xD;
of the cove washed against the beach in a low unceas-&#xD;
ing moan, and the wind swept in sighs through the&#xD;
shivering, skeleton elms. There was a premonition in&#xD;
the soene; all seemed bleak and dying; and I felt a chill&#xD;
of future sorrow seize my heart.&#xD;
The house doors were locked, from which I inferred&#xD;
that father had gone to raise the fykes or to gather&#xD;
oysters as the tide was at low ebb. I walked around&#xD;
the garden and about the out-houses, examining the old&#xD;
familiar objects that perhaps I might never see again,&#xD;
until father returned. A boy was with him, a cousin of&#xD;
mine, little Cornelius Vreeland, who plied me with&#xD;
questions while father went into the house to get his&#xD;
spectacles and read the letter I had brought to him. I&#xD;
had not the courage to speak my errand, and when after&#xD;
reading he stood looking at me with so sad a counte-&#xD;
nance, I was almost ready to tell him I had changed my&#xD;
mind and desired but to remain at home for ever. "Well&#xD;
-weli, boy," said he, "ef you must go, you must go,&#xD;
&#xD;
I 'spose. Your uncle says he finks dat it 'II be debist&#xD;
for you, and he knows bist. Well-well-well, so we&#xD;
go. Old legs can't 'spect young legs to stay at home.&#xD;
rrings ain't now as cloy used to be."&#xD;
He led me alone into a room which had never been&#xD;
used since my mother's time, and was now bare and&#xD;
very dusty. Putting his arm up the chimney flue, he&#xD;
detached a brick, and drew forth an old woollen stock-&#xD;
ing thickly stuffed with gold pieces. Toling out a&#xD;
liberal portion, much to my surprise who had never&#xD;
seen him before part with so much money without an&#xD;
equivalent, he said, "Don't spend dis, Garry, 'less you be.&#xD;
hard pushed. It takes mighty sight o' hard work and.&#xD;
scraping' to git togedder a few pieces like cern. Now,&#xD;
do be keerful on 'em boy." He also took from an old&#xD;
trunk in the kitchen a razor and strop. "Dere, I bin&#xD;
keeping' dese for you. It's 'bout time you begin to use&#xD;
'em; take 'ew long wid you."&#xD;
Not wishing to prolong the parting, I bade father&#xD;
farewell, and hastened away while he stood on the door-&#xD;
step watching me disappear from him for ever. Perhaps&#xD;
had I known this, could I have foreseen that we would&#xD;
never meet again, I woukl not have walked away with&#xD;
so accelerated. a step.&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
WUERE ~FU]~ SEA LED ME.&#xD;
&#xD;
~ft&amp;amp;RRET has a great notion of following the sea,&#xD;
U Captain Widdie," said Mr. Van Horn, after I&#xD;
had signed the articles, and was rated boy on board&#xD;
the good ship Splendid. "So I want you to make a&#xD;
trial of him, and Captain, don't show him any favorit-&#xD;
ism in any way on' account of his connexion with me."&#xD;
"0, I've E ~ doubt ~ut we'll get along very well to-&#xD;
gether," replied the a tam. "He'll b~ a regular&#xD;
blue-jacket, I'll be bound, by the time we get back."&#xD;
Very different, indeed, was this ship-master in appear~&#xD;
ance from the received idea of such a functionary. He&#xD;
was in all a fine specimen of a salt-water dandy. When&#xD;
his vessel arrived in port, he left her immediately and&#xD;
took rooms at the most fashionable hotel, and ~wyer&#xD;
went again on ship-bo~iv4 until the tug was alongside,&#xD;
In superfine broadcloth w~ he clad, with perfumed and&#xD;
&#xD;
glossy hair, bright green kid gloves, thin japanned&#xD;
boots, and an eye-glass and cane! Think of' that for a&#xD;
sailor out of' salem! He was also extremely sensitive&#xD;
as to being thought a seaman, and scrupulously avoided&#xD;
the appearance of one. It was not at all likely that&#xD;
such an officer could have obtained employment from&#xD;
my uncle; but the Splendid, in fact, belonged to&#xD;
Salem, and our house merely acted as consignees. Cap..&#xD;
tam Widdie, too, was part owner of the ship, and as his&#xD;
relatives owned the remainder, his being commander&#xD;
was easily accounted for. She was habitually employed&#xD;
in the East India trade, and was now about to take a&#xD;
hold-full of cotton sheetings, kegs of Carolus dollars,&#xD;
and ginseng to Canton, in exchange for teas, silks, fire-&#xD;
crackers, and matting. I ha thus the prospect of a&#xD;
pleasant Pacific voyage.&#xD;
Now came more leave-takings; with Myndert, who&#xD;
made me promise to write every week at least; with&#xD;
my uncle, who bade me before all to cling to my Bible&#xD;
and read it frequently; ~with Aunt Jane, who added&#xD;
some preserves and a huge fruit cake to a stock of&#xD;
admonitions respecting my moral and. physical health,&#xD;
and then, a private tearing away from Laura the&#xD;
enslaver, who gave me a lock of hair and a ring in ex-&#xD;
change for my kiss; and finally, arriid a shower of tears&#xD;
from Aunt Jane and Laura, I escaped into a hackney&#xD;
coach that was awaiting to bear me, my clothes-bag and&#xD;
my fortunes, away, like young Harry Binif; from iny~&#xD;
dear native bowers, th ocean to roam.&#xD;
As yet I had not seen th Splendid. She had lain at&#xD;
'the Brooklyn wharves, a on the morning of I icr&#xD;
departure was hauled out into the stream opposite&#xD;

&#xD;
Counties Slip. On arriving at the pier-head, I alighted&#xD;
and paid the driver. Alongside th~ dock lay a schooner,&#xD;
from which two men were endeavoring to get three or&#xD;
four drunken sailors into a yawl. The one, who seemed&#xD;
to be in authority, was a short, stout man with a bullet-&#xD;
head, and sharp eyes vivid as quicksilver. I told him I&#xD;
wanted to get on board Captain Widdie's ship Splen-&#xD;
did. "Shipped on her ?" inquired he, scanning my&#xD;
bran-new toggery.&#xD;
"Aye, aye !" said I, feeling every inch a sailor; more&#xD;
so, in fact, than on any subsequent occasion.&#xD;
"Then jump in the boat here, lively I"&#xD;
I obeyed, and took a seat in the stern-sheets, while he&#xD;
continued his efforts to embark the sailors. In this he&#xD;
was assisted by another, probably a boarding-house&#xD;
keeper or crimp of some kind, and they had an awk-&#xD;
ward time of it, for the men being stupidly tiipsy re-&#xD;
pelled all persuasion, and it was only after much strug-&#xD;
gling and cursing that they were impounded. One, an&#xD;
old grey-headed man, with a visage variegated by&#xD;
violent contact with aggressive knuckles, was very&#xD;
troublesome, and in his recalcitrant efforts dropped a&#xD;
bundle of clay-pipes into the water, and then fell over-&#xD;
board after them. Luckily he was fished up in time,&#xD;
and laid dripping on the floor of the boat. Yot in the&#xD;
least sobered by the ducking he tried again to escape,&#xD;
when the short man rapped him smartly on the sk~Jl&#xD;
with a thole-pin, tied his arms with the painter, and&#xD;
laying him fiat, bade me sit on him to keep him quiet.&#xD;
I hesitated, having conscientious scruples about smother-&#xD;
ing a fellow-being; but the order being peremptorily&#xD;
repeated, I complied.&#xD;

&#xD;
After a few strokes of the oars we touched the ship's&#xD;
side, and with the aid of a whip-tackle the men were&#xD;
swung on board. The good ship Splendid certainly&#xD;
belied her name, for a more battered, rusty, unseemly&#xD;
old hulk never floated in the East River, and evidently&#xD;
but little was ever expended on her in the way of paint,&#xD;
cordage, or canvass. As soon as I got on deck I went&#xD;
towards the cabin to report myself to the Captain,&#xD;
when the short man roared out; "Go forward! young-&#xD;
stergo forward'!" It struck me he was unnecessarily&#xD;
abrupt, and that a little politeness in his tone would&#xD;
have improved it vastly. I said as much to the cook in&#xD;
the galley, and asked him who the man was? "Dat's&#xD;
Mr. Benson, do mate, sure nuff. Ilee's bully boy too,&#xD;
I kin tell yei'. Muss kip wedder-eye skinned, git long&#xD;
wid 'im."&#xD;
"Where's Captain Widdie ?"&#xD;
"Ole man's not board yit. He'll be long wid de&#xD;
steam-boat."&#xD;
Along came Benson snapping and snarling like a&#xD;
hungry menagerie, and kicking my luggage about the&#xD;
deck without the slightest formality. "Off with them&#xD;
traps, you young monkey! Stow 'em in the fo'cussle,&#xD;
or I'll heave ~ overboard, quicker er wink !" Down&#xD;
I dragged my chest and clothes-bag into the "fo'cussle,"&#xD;
a triangular den sunk in the bow of the vessel, and con-&#xD;
taining two tiers of bunks; a black filthy hole reeking&#xD;
with the stench of bilge-water, tobacco fumes, and&#xD;
pepper, a cargo of which condiment she had carried&#xD;
from Sumatra on her previous voyage.'&#xD;
But now came the tug-boat with our gallant ~aptain,&#xD;
and I began my sailor duty by heaving away at the&#xD;

wii~dlass to the tune of "Sally ~ the bright&#xD;
mulatter."&#xD;
Then away we glided past Governor's Island, Red&#xD;
Hook, and Staten Island~ The tug left th~ ship; she&#xD;
listed to her bellying sails; soon the hills of Navesink&#xD;
sank from view; home and friends sank with them; and&#xD;
the blue, boundless ocean lay around us!&#xD;
I stood the rocking of the ship without inconvenience&#xD;
until towards evening, the wind having increased, I felt&#xD;
premonitory symptoms of sea-sickness. Making the&#xD;
shortest possible cut to my berth I crept in, feeling ex-&#xD;
cessively qualmish, a sensation the fetid atmosphere of&#xD;
the place tended to aggravate. Soon the ship began to&#xD;
pitch and strain. I could hear the mate roaring like a&#xD;
baited bull, the men running about the deck, their&#xD;
"heave-heo,"----the creaking of blocks and flapping ofi&#xD;
sails; whilst in the forecastle the chests, not being&#xD;
lashed, slid up and down and against the drunken men&#xD;
who were sleeping off their debauch. My illness in-&#xD;
creased. The ship rolled and plunged as if about to&#xD;
break into bits, while at intervals she would stop and&#xD;
quiver in resistance to the enormous waves that dashed&#xD;
against her. Two days lasted the gale, during which&#xD;
time I lay in my bunk suffering the pain of that intense&#xD;
nausea, and incapable of taking any nourishment save a&#xD;
little rice-water brought to me by a Portuguese ship-&#xD;
mate. All may Lmderstand, who have suffered from&#xD;
similar attempts to turn one-self inside out; how I re-&#xD;
pented having left home; how speedily all my bright&#xD;
anticipations vanished, and how even the image~of&#xD;
Laura Ludlow, that ringleted syren, was completely&#xD;
&#xD;
N&#xD;
&#xD;
effaced in the general demolishment of my enthusiasm,&#xD;
for pray, what passion, what constancy can withstand a&#xD;
sensitive' stomach, oscillations, and an atmosphere rank&#xD;
with pepper and stale tobacco-smoke? The Portu~&#xD;
guese came to me on the third morning as I lay&#xD;
helpless. "Rouse up and shake yourself. Never get&#xD;
well laying there. Come on deck and take a mouthful&#xD;
of frcsh air."&#xD;
Wiili a little exertion I reached the deck, and the sea&#xD;
being less agitated and a fine bracing breeze blowing I&#xD;
felt revived. The cook kindly gave me some broth.&#xD;
"Put dis 'tween your ribs-dat'le take de kinks out-&#xD;
nebber do be cascading' allus."&#xD;
This strengthened me, and as from that time we had&#xD;
much fine weather I became well' and hearty and ac-&#xD;
quired a voracious appetite, so that I now look back&#xD;
with amazement on the quantities of salt-junk and plum-&#xD;
duff I made away with, especially as some of that salt-&#xD;
junk had twice circumnavigated the globe, and unlike&#xD;
Madeira wine had certainly not been improved in fla-&#xD;
vor by its extensive voyaging.&#xD;
During my sickness some rogue had forced open my&#xD;
chest and stolen the cake and preserves. Luckily no-&#xD;
thing else was missing. What could have induced any&#xD;
salons son of Neptune to pilfer those confections,&#xD;
would be difficult ~to say, unless he mistook the dark&#xD;
fruit-cake for Cavendish tobacco. Petty thieves, how-&#xD;
ever, are always inconsequent; l3ardolph, we know,&#xD;
"stole a lute-case; bore it twelve leagues, and sold it&#xD;
for three half-pence."&#xD;
I wanted to complain to the captain about the theft,&#xD;
but Silva the Portuguese advised me not to, as it might&#xD;

lead me into trouble, and it was well that the trash&#xD;
was gone.&#xD;
And Captain Widdie, that popinjay mariner, who had&#xD;
accosted me so amiably in my uncle's office, what a&#xD;
metamorphosis did he present! Instead of those glossy,&#xD;
well-fitting habiliments, he wore now the shabbiest,&#xD;
patched, threadbare clothes possible; dirty dungaree&#xD;
overalls~ rusty snuff-colored coat, and a pair of soiled&#xD;
kid gloves to preserve his precious paws! Possibly was&#xD;
he aware of the congruity of his raiment with the&#xD;
amienrance of his ship, for~ everything about her cer-&#xD;
tainly betokened a niggardly spirit in her owners and&#xD;
commander. He had the' reputation among the crew&#xD;
of being a better navigator than sailor, i. c. better&#xD;
acquainted with the theory than the practice of his pro-&#xD;
fession, and he seldom caine out of the cabin except to&#xD;
pace the quarter-deck after' dinner, to take the sun, or to&#xD;
look at the weather for an instant. As for my humble&#xD;
self, this potentate deigned not to notice me, or even to&#xD;
inquire if such a person as Garret Van horn were on&#xD;
board.&#xD;
My uncle's intention in sending me to sea vas to&#xD;
wean inc from evil ways by withdrawing me from temp-&#xD;
tation and pernicious example. He had selected the&#xD;
Splendid as a most suitable ship on account of her being&#xD;
commanded by respectable, sober, God-fearing ofllcer~.&#xD;
In all this he had wofully miscalculated. The owners&#xD;
of the Splendid were doubtless well-meaning folks, who&#xD;
spent what they saved from cheap stores, in good books&#xD;
and tracts for the forecastle, but Captain Widdie was&#xD;
too economical to throw pearls before swine, and, instead&#xD;
of distributing the volumes among the crew, stowed&#xD;

&#xD;
I them away in hi~ cabin to be disposed of as 4he found&#xD;
most profitable to himself. The tracts, I regret to say,&#xD;
were in demand for pipe4ights, for the only literature&#xD;
acceptable to these heathen of the forecastle was such as&#xD;
the "Pirate's Own Book~" "Shipwrecks and Disasters&#xD;
at Sea," or the "Jim Crow Songster." I wished that&#xD;
Captain Widdie had profited by the stock of excellent&#xD;
works in his possession, for he was an avaricious and&#xD;
hypocritical man. He would not swear round open&#xD;
oaths, but used euphemistic expletives that meant as&#xD;
much and were just as vicious. Bully Benson, however,&#xD;
the first mate, did not dilute his profanity' and was&#xD;
indeed a terrible swearer. At times he would vomit&#xD;
forth a profusion of oaths and imprecations blasphemous&#xD;
enough to luring do~~n a thunderbolt on his impious&#xD;
head. lie was cruel too, and would batter the men&#xD;
with his iron fists until they feared him as a spaniel does&#xD;
the switch. The second mate, Joel Brett, was a differ-&#xD;
ent man from either of the superior officers. lie was a&#xD;
tall young fellow, with bushy whiskers and small femi-&#xD;
nine features, and the only officer liked at all by the&#xD;
crew.&#xD;
If Captain Widdie neglected me, Mr. Benson certainly&#xD;
did not. From him, on the contrary, II received~ an&#xD;
excess of attention, more persistent than agreeable.&#xD;
lie was always "hazing" me. From the moment he&#xD;
saw me alight from the hackney coach at the wharf his&#xD;
enmity was "engendered, and when he learnt I was of a&#xD;
rich flimily his hate was rooted. To punish me for all&#xD;
this presumption he would set me about the most disa-&#xD;
greeable offices. lie liked, he said, to take the starch&#xD;
out of city lads; rich men's ~ons had no call to follow&#xD;

the ~ea and take the bread out of poor boys' mouths.&#xD;
So I was installed supervisor of the chicken-coops and&#xD;
pig-pen, and set at a deal more slashing, and polishing&#xD;
of capstan-head and binnacle, than was at all necessary.&#xD;
The crew were a vulgar disrespectful set, and excepting&#xD;
two or three, not to be associated with. An idea seemed&#xD;
to prevail among them that I was a runaway cobbler's&#xD;
apprentice, and so they called me "Wax." I tried to&#xD;
explain away this erroneous idea, but was only derided&#xD;
and annoyed the more by the obnoxious nick-name.&#xD;
They were mostly foreigners, and I found but four&#xD;
Americans among them besides myself. The others&#xD;
comprised natives of almost every European nation,&#xD;
The old man who had behaved so obstreperously during&#xD;
the embarkation was a Manxman, an old weather-beaten&#xD;
sea-dog who had been tossed on every wave of the two&#xD;
oceans. He had even been skipper once, but his beset-&#xD;
ting vice, drunkenness, had ruined him, The old fellow&#xD;
had a great idea of his importance, and since his debauch&#xD;
had been very quiet and reserved. He carefully kept&#xD;
an old battered quadrant, a relic of better days, and it&#xD;
was sadly ludk~rous to se'e him every fine day at noon,&#xD;
take the quadrant from its case, level it with great&#xD;
gravity, and announce it Meridian, There he stood like&#xD;
a statue, the instrument adjusted to his discolored eye&#xD;
(which lasted him till we reached the Line) and the grey&#xD;
locks streaming in the wind from beneath his thrum&#xD;
cap. He was an intelligent man, and it was painful to&#xD;
reflect that one so aged should habitually wallow in the&#xD;
slime of debauchery to be at last cast, like the drifting&#xD;
sea-weed, on some foreign strand to die. Yet such is&#xD;
the fate of how many, many, sailors!&#xD;
&#xD;
Another notable was Silva the Portuguese. His was&#xD;
indeed a checkered existence. A man of about fi#e-and-&#xD;
forty, with a complexion, burnt by the torrid sun, dark&#xD;
as a Kanaka's, and a frame of herculean strength. I&#xD;
saw him, when two men were striving to lift a cask of&#xD;
beef through the booby hatch, push them aside, and&#xD;
with an easy swing heave the cask on deck. His consti-&#xD;
t~ution, nursed in the mild breezes of Madeira, seemed&#xD;
capable of withstanding any assault; he had received&#xD;
gun-shot wounds and cutlass-gashes, a bo~c of sugar had&#xD;
fallen on him crushing, in his ribs, the vomito had pro-&#xD;
strated him and the African coast fever, and yet his&#xD;
vigor remained unimpaired. Though a peaceable man&#xD;
he was easily irritated, and when molested would lash&#xD;
himself into a burst of volcanic anger ~arfulto witness,&#xD;
which caused him to be held in respectful dread by the&#xD;
rest of the crew. With me he was quite communicative,&#xD;
and I found him a, man of much crude intelligence,&#xD;
who, had he received a plain education (for he could&#xD;
neither read noi; write), would certainly have made his&#xD;
mark. I had great admiration for him as the prototype&#xD;
of those romantic pirate captains and heroic smugglers&#xD;
I had so often read of; for he had been engaged in all&#xD;
kinds of lawful and unlawful adventures; had owned&#xD;
vessels; had been proprietor of a slave-factory near&#xD;
Gallinas, which was burnt by English rockets, had&#xD;
smuggled soap into Madeira, where that article is con-&#xD;
t~aband, for which he had suffered a long imprisonment,&#xD;
aud in more and various enterprises of a hazardous&#xD;
nature, all of which would have formed a very enter- -&#xD;
taming book of marvels.&#xD;

tion~, were of the scum of the earth, the raking of sea..&#xD;
ports; men more allied in Their instincts to beasts than&#xD;
to human beings, and withal just as mean and selfish as&#xD;
landsmen. So much, in my opinion, for the popular&#xD;
fallacy about the generosity, gallnntry, and nobleness&#xD;
of seamen, and rude reality~&#xD;
]~re we reached our destination I wa~ quite a sailor.&#xD;
I had got beyond such minor duties as hobjing the reel&#xD;
while the log was cast, etc., and could take a trick at&#xD;
the helm, work a double-crowned wall-knot, serve,&#xD;
parcel, sew, or furl the royals with the best of them. On&#xD;
one occasion, while at the wheel, I had a serious diffi-&#xD;
culty with Mr. Benson. It was on one of those pleasant&#xD;
nights in the Indian Ocean, when the steady breeze&#xD;
permits duck to be spread from every spar and stay;&#xD;
on one of those nights so conducive to meditation, that&#xD;
yielding to its influence, and unmindful of the needle,&#xD;
my wits ~vent a wool-gathering, or a "building of hay-&#xD;
stacks," as the sailors have it, whereby the ship fell&#xD;
several points off her course. This soon attracted Mr.&#xD;
Benson's notice, who brushed away my musings by an&#xD;
exciarnation of anger, and his usual threat to rope's-end&#xD;
me. Another hand was sent to take my place, whilst I&#xD;
betook myself to the lee of the long-boat, and went to&#xD;
sleep under some spare sails. Before long I was sud-&#xD;
denly aroused by a bucketful of water dashed over mc,&#xD;
followed by a kick in my ribs. Of course I was indebted&#xD;
to the first mate for this, and I acknowledged it, as soon&#xD;
as I recovered my scattered senses, by hurling an iron&#xD;
belaying-pin at his head. He dodged it, fortunately for&#xD;
him, and made for me. Quick as a cat I was up the&#xD;
main rigging, while he stood below shaking his fist,&#xD;
&#xD;
cursing me for a wicked monkey, and swearing lie would&#xD;
tan my hide handsomely when he caught me. But I&#xD;
remained in the cross-trees all night, taking cat-naps&#xD;
alongside the sweet little cherub that sits up aloft, and&#xD;
when day came sought ref in the cabin, and en-'&#xD;
treated the Captain to save me from the mate's fury.&#xD;
The Captain pompously said he had a good mind to put&#xD;
me in irons, and have me sent to the States to be tried&#xD;
as a mutineer; discipline was getting outrageously lax&#xD;
aboard his ship, and it was about time insubordination&#xD;
was put a stop to. It was a good opportunity for him.&#xD;
to make a quarter-deck harangue, and he improved it.&#xD;
The crew were summoned ~ft, and he gave them a&#xD;
piece of his mind. He had heard, he said, that some&#xD;
remarks had been made by some of 'em, about the&#xD;
beans and beef. Now, if they didn't shut up about the&#xD;
beans and beef, he'd be darned if he wouldn't have&#xD;
every darn one of 'em in irons in three shakes of a K&#xD;
sheep's tail, darn him if he wouldn't, mind that! Darn&#xD;
set of mutinous scamps they were, always growing'&#xD;
about the beans and beef, and heaving' belaying-pins&#xD;
round! Darn 'em, they all ought to have six dozen&#xD;
lashes apiece, washed down with pickle, darn their&#xD;
11 eyes I And he'd do it too, darned if he wouldn't, if&#xD;
there was any more growing' about the beans and beef&#xD;
goin' on. Go forward, darn you all!&#xD;
Thus I escaped Benson's rage for the moment, but he&#xD;
had his revenge out of me piecemeal. I had n~ot an&#xD;
instant's peace between slushing top-masts, polishing&#xD;
ring-bolts, and scaling the sheet anchor, all'- beneath his&#xD;
fault-finding eye, and forty-two pounder oaths. "Fore&#xD;

Arrived at China we sailed about from one port to&#xD;
another until we had completed our cargo. Now&#xD;
vanished another illusion, as the charmed land of'&#xD;
Kathay and its inhabitants were reduced to real and&#xD;
very dirty aspects. A confused \picture remains to me&#xD;
of paddy fields and ducks, pig-tailed men, bamboo,&#xD;
tauka-boats, matting, junks, thick soles, and tea. The&#xD;
children were very bright, intelligent ones, the pilots&#xD;
exceedingly expert, and the lower classes, as far as a&#xD;
limited experience enabks one to judge, most knavish&#xD;
and vicious. We had almost to watch the spikes in the&#xD;
- ship to prevent their being stolen, and one night we dis.&#xD;
covered some women, in a sampan, who h'ad sculled un-&#xD;
perceived beneath our quarter, stripping the copper&#xD;
sheathing from the rudder.&#xD;
Mymind had been long made up to leave the Splendid&#xD;
at the first opportunity and escape from Mr. Benson s&#xD;
tyranny. I longed to return to Communipaw and re-&#xD;
main contented at home, but unfortunately, while at&#xD;
Hong-Kong, I received a letter which completely altered&#xD;
my intention. It was from Myndert, and brought me the&#xD;
painful news of my father's death. The blow came with&#xD;
double force in view of the determination I had taken.&#xD;
My grief was also rendered the sharper when I reflected&#xD;
how much ingratitude .1 had shown towards a parent&#xD;
who, through his seeming roughness, had always exhi-&#xD;
bited the tenderest solicitudee and affection for his&#xD;
children. Little do we think how each petty act of&#xD;
filial unkindness may become a barbed and rankling&#xD;

enduring reproof of parental love repaid by selfishness&#xD;
and neglect.&#xD;
Nyndert sent me two hundred dollars. This, with&#xD;
the money previously given to me by father, constituted&#xD;
in my view an almost inexhaustible purse. Thus pro-&#xD;
vided I determined, instead of returning home, to&#xD;
gratify my desire of seeing the chief cities of Europe.&#xD;
Quietly giving Captain Widdie the slip, I took passage&#xD;
on board an opium clipper to Bombay. Thence I ship~&#xD;
pod on board an Indiaman to work my way to England,~&#xD;
and some four months after w~s landed at the East-India&#xD;
Docks, London. The sum of mone# sent me by Myn-&#xD;
dert was still intact, the gold I had in reserve having&#xD;
thus far more than summed for all my expenditures. I&#xD;
took lodgings at an inn near the Strand, and for some&#xD;
weeks was busily engaged with the wonders of that&#xD;
interminable city. But London, to me, was not the&#xD;
London~ the guide-books, but the London of Dickens.&#xD;
Fiction and not History had tinged my mind, and&#xD;
0&#xD;
England was the ~ngland of my favorite books, Oliver&#xD;
Twist and Pick~vick. Lomds, palaces, and monuments,&#xD;
had no charms for me, but the pot-boys had, and the&#xD;
footmen and beadles, stout red-faced men in top-boots&#xD;
and charity children, brewers' drayinen and blue-coat&#xD;
boys, porters with knots, 1)uxom bar-maids, and such&#xD;
like things unknown in my country and yet so very&#xD;
familiar. I loved to wander about Lincoln's Inn Fields&#xD;
and Temple Gardens, Gray's Inn Lane and Holborn,&#xD;
and even made a pilgrimage to Goswell street, and to&#xD;

changes of temperament owing to pale ale and XXX&#xD;

nigh exhausted all my funds, and I wrote to Myndert to&#xD;
remit to me as soon as possible all the money he con-&#xD;
veniently could, as I intended to travel on the Conti-&#xD;
nent. I told him, also, that being aware that our father&#xD;
had left a considerable amount of property, I should like&#xD;
to know xvhat~ disposition he had made of it. Not a&#xD;
word, all this time, had passed between Mr. Van Horn&#xD;
and myself, for being in the expectation of a handsome&#xD;
legacy I felt naturally~ enough in an independent mood.&#xD;
Myndert's answer was not long in coming. He had either&#xD;
misunderstood the drift of my letter or had forgotten&#xD;
my inquiries, for his epistle contained nothing to en-&#xD;
lighten me about the amount of my legacy. However&#xD;
it brought me money, my pressing want, and so isped&#xD;
to the Continent.&#xD;
Paris pleased me at once. The contrast was so agree-&#xD;
able between its gay edifices, light atmosphere, and&#xD;
clear sky, and dun-colored, smoky, humid London, that&#xD;
the change exhilarated me as with wine. There was a&#xD;
total absence hei~e of gloominess, - even in the lowest&#xD;
quarters, the Rue ~V[ouffetard for instance, or the Rue&#xD;
aux F~ves, beneath the shadow of old Notre Dame.&#xD;

&#xD;
GARRET VAN HORN.&#xD;
&#xD;
Nothing~ oppressed one with that sense 91f loneliness and&#xD;
d~udg~ry of life which the stranger fe~'1s in the Strand.&#xD;
In London, I lived only on familiar terms with my ficti-&#xD;
tious friends; from the hosts that hurried by me in Fleet&#xD;
street, or dashed through the park in elegant equipages,&#xD;
an impassable barrier separated me. But in Paris I felt&#xD;
completely at home, and as if I had seen* every one&#xD;
~ccwe~ of times before. I ha~1 no hesitation in con-&#xD;
versing, as well as I could, with the picture-dealer on&#xD;
the Boulevard, or the coco-merchant, or the piou-piou&#xD;
(conscript), who was a fellow-spectator with me at the&#xD;
raree-show, in the Champs Elys6es. I did not give&#xD;
them my heart, to be sure, nor did I expect that&#xD;
because they were civil and obliging, they should offer&#xD;
me tlr~ir purses. All I needed was the recognition that&#xD;
~( belonged to the human species, and that courteous-&#xD;
ness, which costs nothing to good-nature, but is never-&#xD;
theless so acceptable, and I received it. My little&#xD;
~knowledge of the French language was rapidly increased,&#xD;
and ere long I could converse with facility. The town&#xD;
was so much to my taste in every respect, that I con-&#xD;
cocted a plan to enable me to prolong my stay there&#xD;
with the approbation of my uncle. I wrote to him, in a&#xD;
dutiful and affectionat&amp;amp; way, that having found a mari-&#xD;
time life very distasteful, on account of the irreligious&#xD;
and immoral men it forced me to associate with, I was&#xD;
obliged, much to my regret, to abandon it. I now&#xD;
wished to enter upon the study of medicine, for which&#xD;
purpose I had come to Paris as that city afforded&#xD;
superior facilities to students, and with his permission, I&#xD;
desired to remain there. My uncle replied, that as he&#xD;
intended to give me every opportunity to make my way&#xD;
&#xD;
149&#xD;
&#xD;
in life, he would accede to my wishes, and therefore&#xD;
authorized me to draw on him, through Hottinguer ~&#xD;
Co., for whatever sums I might find necessary, with the&#xD;
stipulation that they were not to exceed in the total&#xD;
six hundred dollars the year. This was not a liberal&#xD;
allowance, but I was indifferent about it, as I expected&#xD;
that Myndert would keep me supplied with all the&#xD;
money I might need.&#xD;
I matriculated at the School of Medicine. At the&#xD;
outset 1 was rather pleased with the novelty of the&#xD;
study and applied myself with diligence; but before&#xD;
long attendance in the dissecting-room and walks in the&#xD;
hospital became very irksome and distasteful. having&#xD;
made the acquaintance of several young men of my own&#xD;
age and temperament, I was soon 'initiated into all the&#xD;
joyous haunts of the Pays-Latin. A careless, jovial set of&#xD;
fellows they were, as students are all the world over,&#xD;
and to say the truth, we led a vagabond life of it.&#xD;
Although I 'neglected the Museum of Comparative&#xD;
Anatomy and the H6tet-Dieu, I was a frequent atten-&#xD;
dant at the Ohaumi~re and at Bobino. Nay more, I&#xD;
have even, lest me modestly avow it, had the honor at&#xD;
Mobile's of dancing with those distinguished Terpsi-&#xD;
chorean queens, Pomar6 and~ Frisette. Indeed, on a&#xD;
notable occasion at a masked ball, while striving to gain&#xD;
~he applause of the latter damsel and out-rival my vis-&#xD;
4-ok, the famous Chicard, I executed a ccwalier .seul&#xD;
that was talked about for a week, I pinched a light&#xD;
can-can, turned a neat summersault, danced about up~&#xD;
si(1e down for a few seconds to the tune of "Hetme&#xD;
Allou," and then righted myself with a kick that&#xD;
knocked the beaver off a ily-swallqwer who stood&#xD;

staring with a false beak on. There was clapping of&#xD;
hands from the by-standers at my able performance, and&#xD;
a smile from Frisette; but a municipal was discourteous&#xD;
enough to quench my triumph, and in spite of the en-&#xD;
treaties of all present, insisted upon escorting me to the&#xD;
violiA where, after a night's incarceration, I was released&#xD;
on paying twenty francs fine for breiw~i of public&#xD;
order.&#xD;
And so it came to pass, that suppers at the Maison&#xD;
d'Or, boating parties to Asnk~re, and other expensive&#xD;
pleasures, created a greater demand on the avuncular&#xD;
purse than that purse was willing to respond to, and I&#xD;
finally received -the unwelcome intelligence at the&#xD;
banker's that my credit was exhausted. I was then on&#xD;
the verge of my majority, and feeling naturally indig-&#xD;
nant at Mr. Van Horn's parsimony to one who would&#xD;
come into the possession of an ample fortune in a short&#xD;
time, I wrote to my brother to forward me enough to&#xD;
supply my wants until the estate was divided, when I&#xD;
anticipated a glorious season of i'cvelry and pleasure.&#xD;
Myndert wrote, that owing to his having established&#xD;
himself on his own account in business, he had need of&#xD;
all his available means, and regretted that he was unable&#xD;
to furnish me with the money i: required. He said he&#xD;
had appealed to our uncle, who peremptorily refused to&#xD;
give me more than my stipulated allowance. "For-&#xD;
tunately," continued Myndert, "Dr. Rose having acci-&#xD;
dentally heard of the strait you were in, kindly and&#xD;
generously offered to loan me for your use, any sum you&#xD;
might want, to be repaid by you at any time most con-&#xD;
venient. At first I hesitateA to put you under any&#xD;
obligations; but, as he was so pressing, and insisted so&#xD;
&#xD;
st~enaously on accommodating you~ T accepted one&#xD;
hundred dollars, which I beg you will return at the very&#xD;
first opportunity, as debt is a moth to be carefully&#xD;
avoided. II als'o enclose you twenty dollars, making to-&#xD;

Uncle Garret's ears about your extravagant and dissi-&#xD;
pated habits from some person who was in Paris last&#xD;
winter and saw you; but I sincerely trust, Garret, that&#xD;
there is but little truth in that. I am well aware that&#xD;
at your age no one can be expected to act with the&#xD;
calmness and foresight of older people, but then, Garret,&#xD;
there are limits to the permissible folly of youth, which&#xD;
I am sure, as you regard your future happiness ~md&#xD;
health, you will never transgress. I suppose you are&#xD;
studying hard, and I've no doubt that after you obtain&#xD;
your diploma from the Parisian school you will fall at&#xD;
once into a good practice when you return here. I&#xD;
often wish I were with you, there are so many ~places&#xD;
in Paris I should like to visit. The conservatoire des&#xD;
Arts et 7#I~tiers, the A1~s~e d'Artillerie, and the water-&#xD;
works of Marly are among the most interesting, I am&#xD;
told. I daresay you have seen them often. ~I ~should&#xD;
also like to go to the Museum of Marine, and see if&#xD;
there are any models now worth noticing. The French,&#xD;
you are doubtless aware, were the first to inaugurate&#xD;
our modern system of ship-building. Bouguer and&#xD;

I reperused this letter carefully. Not a word did&#xD;
it contain about what I was most anxious to know.&#xD;
I tossed it aside with a smile of bitter contempt, after&#xD;
having, however, pocketed the draft for six hundred&#xD;
francs. What could Myndert mean by his silence in&#xD;
regard to the property left by my late father? A sus~&#xD;
picion crossed my mind: the Van Horns ~vere a close-&#xD;
fisted, money-loving and acquiring set, and Myndert&#xD;
was not exempt from the family failing. Was he schem-&#xD;
ing to deprive me of my legal and equitable right of&#xD;
inheritance? Fired with indignation at such a thought&#xD;
I wrote an urgent, bold, and somewhat reproachful&#xD;
letter to my unck~, demanding an explanation of Myn4&#xD;
dert's singular conduct.&#xD;
Dr. Rose's note ran as follows:&#xD;
'~ Dear Garry,"&#xD;
"Understanding you were suffering from too copious&#xD;
a depletion of the exchequer, I make bold, as the Irish~&#xD;
~ncn say, to offer a world-renowned specific for th&amp;amp;&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
same, which 2Vtyndeit will forward to you. Uncle Van&#xD;
made some remarks about getting into expensive habits&#xD;
and so forth. Asked him if he'd ever been young, said&#xD;
he had, though I don't believe it. Then I told him he&#xD;
should know how to make allowances for a young fellow&#xD;
all blood and blue veins, and much more to the same&#xD;
purpose, until the old gentleman was perfectly satisfied&#xD;
with my explanations. I suppose you are ~ your&#xD;
farces,' as they call it where you are. Well, go it, my&#xD;
boy, youth and the season of pleasure soon pass away,&#xD;
so enjoy it while you may. If you do spend a little&#xD;
more money, you have time enough to hoard when gray&#xD;
hairs comet Besides, remember, Uncle Van's worth a&#xD;
good plump million and it is safe to say that somebody&#xD;
we wot of will have a big share of that' pie when it's&#xD;
cut up. Should you fall short again of the needful, and&#xD;
Uncle Van be obdurate, let me know and I will if I can.&#xD;
Depend on that.&#xD;
"Sincerely, your friend,&#xD;
"EDivw2u Rosn."&#xD;
This was a generous and friendly offer, certainly, and&#xD;
it appeared the more so w1~en contrasting it with the&#xD;
meanness and injustice of a brother. I disdained answer-&#xD;
ing the latter's letter hut acknowledged the Doctor's,&#xD;
with many thanks for the loan, and promises to repay it&#xD;
in a short time. This done I turned my attention to the&#xD;
draft for six hundred francs and had it cashed. Six&#xD;
hundred francs, it was a nice little lump o~ gold taken&#xD;
all in Napo1~eons, but it slipped away so fast! Dr. Rose&#xD;
gave good advice, youth soon passes and it's time enough&#xD;

comrades we made the noce with a v~iigeance. S~ueh&#xD;
riot and revelry, such feasting and folly, of a surety, was&#xD;
never exceeded, not even by the Prodigal Son and his&#xD;
boon companions. But the tempest was too severe to&#xD;
last long and soon my purse was flaccid. Then came&#xD;
the morn of repentance and the day of virtuous resolves,&#xD;
when I fed on corn-husks and bitter herbs.&#xD;
Time squandered, money squandered. Youth is the&#xD;
same and has learnt nothingg since the world began.&#xD;
Some time had elapsed ere I bethought me to deIfr~r&#xD;
Monsieur Rivois' letter. It was addressed in this wise:&#xD;
".1 .Akmsieur,"&#xD;
"~M~.rnsieur Charles Antoine Dume~srn-i1, p&amp;amp;e,&#xD;
au~ soins de A o~rtsieur Charles Antoine .Dumesnit, fits,"&#xD;
"Pari&amp;amp;."&#xD;
Searching in the " Alinanach du Commeree," I found&#xD;
that "~.Dumesnit pare et fits," perffimers and distillers,&#xD;
kept a shop at No. flue croix des Petits champs,&#xD;
and going thither I was very politely received by Ma-&#xD;
dame Charles Anthonyfits; who was book-keeper and.&#xD;
manager of the sales department. She wa~ fat and&#xD;
brisk, and apprised me that the Messrs. Dumesnil, father&#xD;
and son, were at Fontenay-aux-Roses, a village near&#xD;
Paris where they had a country house. "And," added&#xD;
she, "if Monsieur would have the complaisance to go&#xD;
there Sunday next and make us the pleasure to pass the&#xD;
day with us, if it does not disarrange Monsieur too&#xD;
much, we will be charmed to make the acquaintance of&#xD;
a~friend of our relative Rivois."&#xD;
I' accepted the invitation and next Sunday found me&#xD;
&#xD;
at Fontenay-aux-Roses, so called from the great quantity&#xD;
of roses cultivated there for the use of the Paris per.&#xD;
fumers. The Dumesnils had an extensive laboratory&#xD;
near their dwelling which was an unpretending and yet&#xD;
pretty house, built of "moellon~," the soft cream-colored&#xD;
stone quarried aroui~d Paris. Monsieur Dumesnil pare&#xD;
was a good sl~ecimen of the bon- vieiltcrd~ He was&#xD;
loquacious, and after many inquiries about his cousin&#xD;
Rivois he invited me to inspect the garden, an object of&#xD;
his especial solicitude. Whilst pointing out with his&#xD;
staff a shrub here and a plant there, he interrogated me&#xD;
about America. "It makes very hot in Amerique, is it&#xD;
not? One has no need 'of furs. Coffee is cheap, with-&#xD;
out doubt, and the sugar? and the tobacco? The&#xD;
bananas they should grow wild? and the pine-apples&#xD;
you have for nothing? How that musi; be magnificent,&#xD;
that vegetation? how many slaves have you in your&#xD;
family? and the savages ?" etc. etc. From which que-&#xD;
ries I inferred that father Dumesnil's idea about my&#xD;
native land was, like that of many other Frenchmen I&#xD;
had met, that it was situated somewhere between the&#xD;
Island of Martinique and the Louisiane. At dinner-&#xD;
time the old gentleman presented to me with much&#xD;
pride his two grand-children, one, an alert young tye~em&#xD;
come on a weekly visit to his parents, and the other, a&#xD;
pretty modest damsel of fourteen, dressed with the&#xD;
exceeding neatness and plainness of French maidens.&#xD;
At evening we all went to a village ball and here I&#xD;
learnt that my host Dumesnil fits was Monsieur the&#xD;
Mayor. I made myself ~s agreeable as possible and had&#xD;
the honor 6f dancing with Madame Dumesnil and seve-&#xD;
ral of the prettiest lasses present. Although this assem~&#xD;

the French hat~e homes, that they did7not all live in caf6s,&#xD;

"I notice that you scorn to labor under a misapprehen-&#xD;
sion in regard to property left you by your late father.&#xD;
By th9 will of your lamented parent his whole estate,&#xD;
both personal and real, is bequeathed to your brother&#xD;
~Jyndert. Therefore I hasten to disabuse you of any&#xD;
anticipations you may have formed in that respect.&#xD;
I-loping that you will henceforth limit your expenditures&#xD;
and shape your conduct so as to meet my approbation&#xD;
remain,               "Your affectionate uncle,&#xD;
"G. VAN HoRN."&#xD;
This letter explained Myndert's reticence on the sub-&#xD;
ject of my father's will, and moreover, exhibited his&#xD;
parsimony in a very odious light. I never would have&#xD;
believed it possible that he could have shown such&#xD;
a niggardly spirit, such a lack ~f generosity and frater-&#xD;
nal feeling as he did in offering me that insignificant pit-&#xD;
tance out of his abundance. I would have starved now&#xD;
rather than ask him for a copper; and resolved that at&#xD;
the first opportunity I would repay him the beggarly&#xD;
twenty dollars, and then break with him for ever.&#xD;
Although I was disappointed at the disposition my&#xD;
father had made of his property, yet, I was not much&#xD;
surprised, as I could not but acknowledge that he had&#xD;
been actuated entirely by the firm belief that I would&#xD;
certainly inherit the far greater wealth of his brother.&#xD;
I now perceived how completely I depended upon my&#xD;
uncle's bounty. This reflection which in a shrewder per-&#xD;
son would have rendered him supple and compliant, served&#xD;
but to irritate my self-will. I hugged the belief that I was&#xD;
unjustly treated, and sought some method to bring Uncle&#xD;
Garret to a sense and repentaiThe of his harsh usage of me.&#xD;
&#xD;
SI&#xD;
&#xD;
Whilst I lived in the Latin Quarter my room-mate&#xD;
was a young man by the name of Jules Flandrin. In&#xD;
age he was a year or so younger than I, in brain about&#xD;
as ill-ballasted a being. I-us parents were small gloves&#xD;
in Grenoble, whose ambitious wishes were centered in&#xD;
this son for whom they had pinched and saved that he&#xD;
might become a prop and honor to their declining years.&#xD;
Similarity of taste brought about a friendship between&#xD;
Jules and me, and we shared each other's sorrows and&#xD;
shirts, and dipped promiscuously in both purses. Fancy&#xD;
us invested in that loose-fish style which proclaims the&#xD;
student, with slouched caps, hair uncut, straggling neck-&#xD;
erchief~, trowsers plaited at the waist and~ restless,&#xD;
seated in a small traiteur's or restaurant in the Rue de&#xD;
1' (Jniversit~. The traiteur was celebrated for his fricas-&#xD;
seed sheep's trotters, and my friend and I had just made&#xD;
away with a dish of those delectable morsels.&#xD;
"There," said I to Jules, showing him the 'piece of&#xD;
silver' wherewith I was about to pay for our repast ;~&#xD;
"regard the last franc I have in the world."&#xD;
"Good, I felicitate thee of it, my good Van I-Torn,"&#xD;
replied Jules taking the pipe from his mouth. "Thou&#xD;
returnest to the normal state of the man. What is&#xD;
money but' a j~rejudice? if the world should rid itself&#xD;
to-day of this prejudice thou and I, my dear, would be&#xD;
as rich as stock-brokers. Thou hast begun by setting&#xD;
the example and thou hast done well. At least, thou&#xD;
hast done thy duty, which is always a great consolation&#xD;
whatever happens."&#xD;
"In awaiting that the rest of the world follow my&#xD;
example and rid themselves of this prejudice what am I&#xD;
to do? Listen; I am the adopted son of my uncle, who&#xD;

is very rich. My father left everything he had to my&#xD;
brother who is avaricious. I, comprehendest thou, was&#xD;
to be heir to my uncle. Now, I am sent here, or II some&#xD;
here, to Paris to study the medicine. Thou knowest&#xD;
that the life is dear here; that there are books to be&#xD;
bought, and other accessories to study which cost. Well&#xD;
then, all that my miser of an uncle will allow me is a&#xD;
beggarly seven hundred and fifty francs every three&#xD;
months. What thickest thou of that ?"&#xD;
"My faith," said Jules, "it is hard it is true, but it is&#xD;
chronic that with the papas. They have always been&#xD;
un#~asonable. How will you that a student pursue his&#xD;
studies properly and not spend money? It's not possi-&#xD;
ble. He earns nothing and one cannot live on such&#xD;
wages. And the gloves and the ribbons for Mam'selle&#xD;
Adele, it costs! without counting the treats of merin-&#xD;
gues and raspberry vinegar for her, an~ occasionally a&#xD;
bead or arm for oneself-not true? They don't think&#xD;

"As thou conceive, t is mean smn not sufficing for&#xD;

snarls like an enraged dog. Isnot that enough to make&#xD;
one disbelieve in all the Christian virtues? That man&#xD;
not only evinces a total disregard of the sacred obliga-&#xD;

"Good. We are brothers, and free. Listen at thy&#xD;

good family of Grenoble, honest lovers by occup~ition.&#xD;
My elder brother succeeds to the factory and devotes&#xD;
him to the kid-skins. Of me they wish to make a&#xD;
doctor, as my good parents have the mania of believing&#xD;
that I possess the best head of the family, which does&#xD;

In fine, here I am, student in medicine. It was n'ot my&#xD;

carver of human skins than a carver of kid-skins, and&#xD;
my father shares that opinion. My idea of mine was&#xD;

I drew a bad number at the conscription, and would&#xD;
have much liked to go, but my father bought a substi-&#xD;

man. Let us enrol ourselves; as volunteers we will&#xD;

Turn soldier? The proposal at first presented no-&#xD;
thing very attractive; but soon I tasted and relished&#xD;
the bait. The more I thought of it the more pleased&#xD;
was II with the idea; besides, I was in the mood to&#xD;
accept any position that promised to relieve me from&#xD;
my dependance on unnatural relatives. An inherent&#xD;
love of adventure also prompted me to this rash step,&#xD;
and so without more ado, as I spoke French as well as&#xD;
a provincial, I enlisted under the name of Victor&#xD;
Joceaux, (as by passing for a native I would escape being&#xD;
&#xD;
drafted into the Foreign Le~gion) and was enrolled into&#xD;
a corps of ekctsseurs4pied. Flandrin preferred the&#xD;
cavalry service, and was sent to Saumur to join the&#xD;
mounted eltasseur.9. I remained at the Vincennes&#xD;
barracks to go~,through a series of drihings and gym-&#xD;
nastic exercises preparatory to the~ earnest work of a&#xD;
campaign. A few months at this and our regiment was&#xD;
transferred to Clermont in Auvergne. here was a&#xD;
large body of infantry and cavalry under the ~oinmand&#xD;
of General de C-, an old soldier of the Empire.&#xD;
Drilling again, and of the severest kind, for General do&#xD;
C- was a rigid martinet, and. gave our wearied&#xD;
limbs no rest. A queer-looking man was he, a little,&#xD;
withered oetagenarian, tough as a hide-whip, and full&#xD;
of freaks and whims of inflexible discipline. lie would&#xD;
choose some cold, stormy night and at one o'clock in&#xD;
the morning set drums beating and bugles blowing,&#xD;
rousing the soldiers from their sweet slumbers, and at&#xD;
their head, lead them through pelting rain and cutting&#xD;
blast, on, miles on, over hill and dale, and all the obstruc-&#xD;
tions he could find, until at dawn they returned, drenched&#xD;
and dirty, tired and grumbling, to their quarters.&#xD;
There was a dash of humor, too, in the grim old&#xD;
General, and he was fond of a practical joke. The great&#xD;
sq'aare at Clermont, where stands the statue of Desaix,&#xD;
was the spot generally chosen for reviews, and one side&#xD;
of this place was nearly all taken up by crockery lenders,&#xD;
who made a wide-spread display of their wares. The&#xD;
General noticed this, and one, day, on parade, ordered&#xD;
our regiment to perform an evolution which) sent the&#xD;
men at the pas gymnastique right athwart the plates,&#xD;
dishes, pitchers, and bowls. Groat was the clatter, but&#xD;

greater the jabber and ejaculations of the exa~pei'ated&#xD;
merchants, and the merriment of the on-lookcrs.~ At&#xD;
another time the General, passing along the high-street&#xD;
just as a sch~o1 was being dismissed, stopped the&#xD;
scholars~ and said to them: " Well, my children, would&#xD;
you like to be soldiers ?" "0 yes," shouted many of&#xD;
the boys, who recognized the General. "Well then,"&#xD;
said he, pointing to a pastry-cook's opposite; "let me&#xD;
see you storm that shop, en avant, to the assault !" At&#xD;
it the troop of urchins ~vent, with sticks and with stones,&#xD;
pelting the sbop, smashing the windowss, and cheering&#xD;
lustily, as the General urged them on with a flourishing&#xD;
cane. The pastry-cook was obliged to fly before the&#xD;
shower of missiles, while the boys, crowding in, soon&#xD;
pillaged the shop of all cakes find tarts much to the&#xD;
amusement of General do C-. It is hardly neces-&#xD;
sary to add, that he always amply ~ompensatedth~&#xD;
sufferers for the damage occasioned by such freaks~~f&#xD;
his.&#xD;
A few months spent in Clermont and our regiment&#xD;
marched southward and at Toulon embarked for Africa,&#xD;
for about this time the Kabyles were giving the colo-&#xD;
nists of Algeria serious trouble, and the French govern-&#xD;
ment had deteriiilned to strike a signal blow at these&#xD;
predatory and warlike Arab tribes. On disembarking,&#xD;
there we, our corps was immediately sent into the inte-&#xD;
rior o' the country towards Mascara and the Tlemeen,&#xD;
which were chosen as the base of future operations&#xD;
against the aggressive natives.&#xD;
In spite of the rigor and restraint of discipline, I was&#xD;
the more and more pleased with the profession I had so&#xD;
&#xD;
164&#xD;
&#xD;
165&#xD;
&#xD;
suddenly adopted. It was spiced with novelty and&#xD;
variety, but above that the active labor it entailed upon&#xD;
me, the marching and exercise, gave a certain pleasura-&#xD;
ble vigor to my constitution, hitherto somewhat impair-&#xD;
ed by irregular habits and excesses. Much was due also&#xD;
to my companions, for it was impossible to be otherwise&#xD;
than contented among such fellows as the -rd Chas-&#xD;
seurs. They were mostly Parisians, garnins de Paris,&#xD;
some of them young men of education and animated by&#xD;
the ambition of carving their way to fame, but withal&#xD;
the most reckless, gay, turbulent, graceless, good-&#xD;
hearted, daring set of mortals the sun ever shone on.&#xD;
The camp rang with singing and jesting, with quips and&#xD;
quizzing, with lazzis and chctnsonettes, from morning&#xD;
till night, and their very mishaps were turned into sub-&#xD;
j ects of merriment. It is this characteristic of the&#xD;
French, their elasticity of spirit, which contributes&#xD;
chiefly to make them such excellent soldiers. Not&#xD;
defeats, drudgery, heat or cold, scanty food, tedious&#xD;
marches, vigils or other hardships ever quench their&#xD;
ardor or check their spring. Leagues and leagues on&#xD;
would these gay-hearted troopers travel, through the&#xD;
cutting blasts of the mountain passes or over the hot,&#xD;
scorching, desert sands, with as springy a step as a wed-&#xD;
ding guest; not with sullen determination, but with&#xD;
cheerfulness, even whilst sucking cherrypits to allay the&#xD;
pang of thirst, reminding one of their ancestors who&#xD;
served in the Gallic legion, the Alauda, and who bore&#xD;
on their helmets a lark, symbol of early vigilance and&#xD;
liveliness. I-low the original stock strikes through and&#xD;
asserts its predominance over the interfusion of foreign&#xD;
breeds. Here were men with Greek, Latin, and German&#xD;

blood in their veins, and yet what true sons of I3ren-&#xD;
nus and Vercingetorix were they. Loquacious, hot-tem-&#xD;
pered, quick to fight, but devoid of malice as Strabo&#xD;
described the 0-auls; that noisy, 'warring, fearless race,&#xD;
who returned and defied the thunders of Heaven with&#xD;
flights of arrows.&#xD;
The French soldier has often been represented as a&#xD;
blood-thirsty, ferocious swashbuckler. Nothing can be&#xD;
further from the truth. On the contrary, he fights&#xD;
simply because he believes he is thereby acquiring glory&#xD;
for himself and his country, and he is brave because&#xD;
poltroonery is dishonorable. But he never fights for&#xD;
the sheer love of shedding blood, Although an&#xD;
manageable, turbulent fellow, his frolics generally take&#xD;
a merry turn and seldom end in a shindy. Perhaps no&#xD;
class, in or out of France, can furnish a larger propor-&#xD;
don of noble, high-minded, honorable men, than can be&#xD;
found among the intelligent and educated soldiers of&#xD;
the French army, for, paradoxical as it may seem,&#xD;
though the soldier is an excrescence on society and war&#xD;
a terrible evil, yet nothii~g tends so to develop our&#xD;
better impulses like the profession of arms, while corn-&#xD;
m~rce, "the peaceful interchange of commodities," "the&#xD;
band-maid of civilization," only educes the meaner and&#xD;
selfish onesA~&#xD;
During the time I was in Algeria, although constantly&#xD;
in active service, II had but two opportunities to take&#xD;
part in a conflict. One of these was but i~ skirmish&#xD;
* A fact well understood by all acute analysts of character: wit-&#xD;

which occurred as we were passing through a defile of&#xD;
the Atlas to rejoin a portion of our division that had&#xD;
been off on an excursion against the Beni-M6nad. Sud-&#xD;
denly, we found ourselves in an ambuscade, and 'surZ&#xD;
rounded by hostile Bedouins who poured a shower of&#xD;
bullets upon us. On either side were irregular piles of&#xD;
rocks from behind which the brown rascals were aiming&#xD;
their long shooting tubes at us. One word from th~&#xD;
officers, and the men scattered and sought the foe,&#xD;
Nothing exasperates soldiers like an unseen attack, and&#xD;
they sprang about with so much alacrity, that the&#xD;
Bedouins chose the discreet part and escaped, after&#xD;
leaving a few of their number bayoneted on the spot.&#xD;
in this encounter we met with the severe loss, for their&#xD;
murderous volley had killed ten of our men and wounded&#xD;
several others. This little affair was but the prelude to&#xD;
an important one, and by night-fall we had joined two&#xD;
regiments of zouaves and one of tiraigeur3 indig~nes&#xD;
with whom we were to storm Ai-Sebron, a stronghold&#xD;
of the Beni-M6nasser on the Zakkar range. The celerity&#xD;
and precision with which the army encamped for the&#xD;
night was something remarkable. The . tents were&#xD;
pitched, wood split, fires kindled, and supper preparing&#xD;
in a trice, while the men, laying aside theb~ havresacks&#xD;
and coats, were refreshing themselves after the fatigue&#xD;
of the march in smoking their short clay pfpes. The&#xD;
cooks of each gamelle or~ mess, stirred the soup and&#xD;
hummed some joyous refrain, and the camp, in fact, bore&#xD;
the aspect of a happy village. Suppe~' over, there were&#xD;
clothes and shoes to mend, more pipe-smoking and&#xD;
singing until the bugle sounded. Then the silence of&#xD;
death reigned over all, lights were extinguished,~ and no&#xD;

&#xD;
signs of life were visible, save in the distance, at inter-&#xD;
vals, through ~a large circumference could be seen the&#xD;
watch-fires burning, but no piquet or sentinel, for that&#xD;
faithful guardian is stationed f~r in advance of the fire,&#xD;
prone to earth, hid in the grass, with eye and ear&#xD;
strained and finger on trigger, for the Kabyles are wily&#xD;
as Iroquois and love to spring on an unguarded enemy.&#xD;
In the morning after a breakfast of bread and coffee,&#xD;
the tents are struck with the same rapidity that we&#xD;
encamped, and we ai'e off on our way again rejoicing.&#xD;
The lieutenant of our company, Leon Vivier, was a&#xD;
handsome, well-knit, young fellow with clear, open gray&#xD;
eyes, short chestnut hair and a fresh, frank face. lie was&#xD;
a graduate of St. Cyr, and a young fellow of promise,&#xD;
and had proved his gameness by a singular duel at&#xD;
school. Having been grossly insulted, soon after his&#xD;
entrance in college, by an older student, Leon fired up&#xD;
and challenged him to fight. Thids were rife among the&#xD;
collegians at that time, and the professors to prevent&#xD;
them had deprived the pupils of all weapons. Leon&#xD;
and his antagonist were unable to evade the restrictions&#xD;
and settle their little affair, which afforded food for&#xD;
taunts from the insulter, who said that Leon had fur-&#xD;
nished information to the authorities in order to prevent&#xD;
the meeting. Outraged at this aspersion, Leon chal-&#xD;
lenged the other to fight him with the steel compasses of&#xD;
their mathematical instruments, as they could obtain no&#xD;
better weapons. His adversary consented, and the two&#xD;
with their ~seconds retired to a secluded room. The&#xD;
compasses when extended formed formidable, sharp-&#xD;
pointed dirks of eighteen inches in length, and with&#xD;
these the boys fought. The affair was conducted very&#xD;
&#xD;
systematically and after a few minutes of parry anVd&#xD;
lunge, L eon received a half-inch of thq compass-leg in&#xD;
his arm, while his antagonist caught an ugly rent in his&#xD;
check which greatly disfigured him, The young fellows&#xD;
were both punished, but Leon established his reputation&#xD;
as a lad not to be trifled with with impunity.&#xD;
I allude particularly to this young officer as an inti-&#xD;
macy sprang up between us. It had become known in&#xD;
the regiment that I was an American, and as Leon's&#xD;
grandfather had served as captain under Viomenil at&#xD;
Yorktown ho naturally felt some interest in my country,&#xD;
and would often question inc about it. lIe was a great&#xD;
favorite with the men, and had already received the cross&#xD;
of honor for gallantly saving the life of a wounded&#xD;
drummer at the peril of his own.&#xD;
Arrived at Ai-Sebron, we prepared to assault it.~&#xD;
Each regiment furnished a certain number of volunteers&#xD;
to form the van of the attacking body. I make no pre-&#xD;
tensions to great bravery, but as I was publicly known&#xD;
to be an American, I felt it incumbent on me to cast&#xD;
aside all thoughts of my timid self; and prove for once&#xD;
a worthy son of the glorious Confederation. There are&#xD;
undoubtedly, in every man two natures, one which&#xD;
prompts him when acting for his, owii clay-built selfish&#xD;
body, and the other which shows itself when h6 acts for&#xD;
what is dearer, such as his children or his country.&#xD;
Under the latter stimulus, and that of a stiff dram of&#xD;
the oantini~re's brandy, I asked permission to make one&#xD;
of the forlorii hope or "lost children," as the French&#xD;
term them. H~d I been among my countrymen I cci'-&#xD;
tainly should not have insisted upon this distinction&#xD;
but, l)laced as I was, I had no alternative, and did ~jUst&#xD;

&#xD;
as any American would do under similar circumstanceS.&#xD;
The ,point to be stormed was situated on an almost in-&#xD;
accessible crag, and there was a long acclivity to be&#xD;
passed over before we could reach the enemy  who, as&#xD;
the advanchig columns were clambering the height,&#xD;
poured a sweeping fire at them from behind their ram-&#xD;
parts. Now is the time, thought I; now is the time to&#xD;
show these Frenchmen that no Yankee lags behind&#xD;
when there's danger to be sought, and setting my jaw,&#xD;
I grasped my rifle firmly and leaped eagerly in front.&#xD;
Leon was beside mc; his handsome resolute face beam~&#xD;
ing with enthusiasm, and bounding from rock to rock&#xD;
like a chamois. I passed him, and was in fair way to be&#xD;
the first at the foe, and who knows what prodigies of&#xD;
valor I might have performed, ~vhen, unluckily, I was&#xD;
bowled off my feet like a skittle by a huge piece of rock&#xD;
rolled d9wn by those miscreants of Arabs. I fell into a&#xD;
hollow, where I lay with tl~e stone directly over my&#xD;
bruised leg, pinning me to the earth, and I too weak to&#xD;
remove the crushing weight which caused me intense&#xD;
pain. Several others were knocked about in the same&#xD;
way, which, with the hot fire of the enemy, for a mo-&#xD;
ment checked the vigor of the assault. Leon had a&#xD;
piece of his scalp torn off by some projectile. It was&#xD;
but a slight wound though, and an old grizzly Zonave&#xD;
unwinding his turban, bound it tightly round the bleed-&#xD;
ing head. Our lieutenant was about springing forward&#xD;
again when he discovered me in my1 unfortunate and&#xD;
inglorious plight. " Tiens!" said he, "here is the&#xD;
American, nailed !" and rolling aside with some effort&#xD;
the heavy mass, he placed me in an easy position.&#xD;
"You see," said I, with a sickly smile, "there is no&#xD;
&#xD;
danger of my running away." But Leon had no further&#xD;
time to spare, for being newly decorated he was eager&#xD;
to show himself worthy of his "cross." So away he&#xD;
dashed with his sword drawn, and the end of the turban&#xD;
fluttering in the wind like a pennon. There was a great&#xD;
quantity of men now crowding up the steep, and the&#xD;
powder-smoke obscured my view; but, for an instant I&#xD;
distinguished him standing on the rampart, bareheaded,&#xD;
and his face a mask of blood; for a second, his blade&#xD;
quivered like a ray of light, and then, leaping among&#xD;
the enemy I saw him no more. The Kabyles were,&#xD;
after a stubborn resistance, completely routed; but our&#xD;
men found after the fight a bloody corse, charred and&#xD;
mangled by some explosion, which they 'could not&#xD;
recognize. There was part of a miniature about it,&#xD;
however, the face of a lady, which1 the Colonel pro-&#xD;
nounced to be a likeness of Leon Vivier's mother. Poor&#xD;
lady! had she seen this horrible, blackened mass of&#xD;
flesh, that had once been her handsome son, her darling&#xD;
child, reared in such tender, vigilant solicitude, would&#xD;
his glory have consoled her? chair d Canon! Food&#xD;
for powder!&#xD;
Picked up with the other wounded I was placed in a&#xD;
tumbril, where I lay groaning with pain increased by&#xD;
every jolt of the vehicle to agony. The fear of losing a&#xD;
leg added also to my torture, as these army-surgeons&#xD;
have a frightful knack of sawing off limbs on the slight-&#xD;
est pretence. To my great relief the surgeon decided&#xD;
that amputation was not necessary; and, though my&#xD;
injuries were very severe, that I would eventually have&#xD;
as sound a leg as ever. Asthe division intended to ex-&#xD;

tend its operations further into the region of the hostile&#xD;
Berbers, the sick and disabled were sent back to Oran.&#xD;
here I remained some four months in the hospital,&#xD;
owing much 6f my complete recovery to the care of&#xD;
those estimable women, the Sisters of Oharity.&#xD;
Since my enlistment I had received but one letter from&#xD;
home. I had not apprised my relatives of the step I&#xD;
had taken, but they probably learnt of it through Mons,&#xD;
Rivois' cousin, Dumesnil, for a missive came from Uncle&#xD;
Garret to me couched in very severe terms, to the effect,&#xD;
that when tired of military glory, and dissatisfied with&#xD;
the vicious, worthless life I was leading, he would con-&#xD;
sent to receive my apologies. This censure had the sole&#xD;
effect of making me remain longer in the army than I&#xD;
wished to, for in truth, having now worn this new fancy&#xD;
threadbare, I would gladly have cast it aside had I had&#xD;
any way to escape the imputation of eating humble-pie.&#xD;
The loop-hole came at last in the shape of a~ letter from&#xD;
Myndert, who sent me money to procure my discharge&#xD;
from service, and urged me, with fraternal kindness and&#xD;
earnestness, not to waste the best years of my life in&#xD;
the perhaps worse than precarious life of a soldier;&#xD;
bidding me also remember, that I would probably lose&#xD;
all advantages for the future if I persisted in incurring&#xD;
Uncle Garret's displeasure. As the future had not yet&#xD;
become a subject of disquietude to me, or even one of&#xD;
much reflexion, and as monetary considerations had as&#xD;
little influence, all my brother's reasoning would have&#xD;
proved entirely forceless had I not been in a frame of&#xD;
mind eager to catch at any pretext for doing what I&#xD;
otherwise dared not do, through thc silly fear of being&#xD;
&#xD;
thought repentant and subdued. Therefore I mao~i&#xD;
~ urn-&#xD;
mously accepted my brother's advice as it chimed so&#xD;
well with iiiy incniiation.~. The necessary measures&#xD;
were soon taken, and I was again at liberty in dQ-&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;
HOME AGAIN.&#xD;
J RETURNED to New York in the month of September,&#xD;
184-, a man in stature and in strength, but yet&#xD;
how boyish in thought and intention!&#xD;
It is almost worth the whilq to expatriate oneself&#xD;
for the sole pleasure of returning home, if one has kind&#xD;
friends and relations to greet him, not such, however,&#xD;
as Uncle Garret, who, when I hastened to his counting-&#xD;
room immediately on my arrival, received me a~ coolly&#xD;
as if he had seen me the day before, and merely said,&#xD;
with a spice of sarcasm, "So-so, back again, eh?&#xD;
Tired of soldiering, eh? Hope it's taught you system&#xD;
and order, at least." Mortified at this reception I turned&#xD;
aside without replying and shook hands with Mr. Krolz,&#xD;
the German, who was truly gratified to see me. Then&#xD;
Mr. Otter came forward with his slow, hypocritical&#xD;
smile, and unmeaning salutation. I noticed he had&#xD;
&#xD;
gained his point for he was now chief clerk, Mr. Hogg&#xD;
having been superseded. I inquired, what had become&#xD;
of the old man?&#xD;
"Don't know," said Otter. "lie was useless here.&#xD;
We had to discharge him-too old-made too many&#xD;
mistakes-memory gone and could hardly see."&#xD;
Poor worn out book-keeper! Forty years' constant&#xD;
staring at white paper and inillio~is of brain-straining&#xD;
calculations have done their work. What are you fit&#xD;
for now? Even a superannuated horse should not be&#xD;
turned out to die.&#xD;
Dear Aunt Jane's warm welcome made ample amends&#xD;
for her husband's frigid one. She hung over m and cried&#xD;
like a mother over her long lost son. Poor woman, she&#xD;
was thin and pale now, and time.seemed deali~ig harshly&#xD;
with her. "Have you been sick, Aunt Jane ?" inquired.&#xD;
"No-no-but Thu so glad to see you, Garry. Dear-.&#xD;

and you look so like a Frenchman with that beard and&#xD;
with that hat on, too. Really, I should never have&#xD;
known you."&#xD;
Of course her budget of news was almost inexhausti-&#xD;
ble, and I found she had lost none of her old volubility.&#xD;
"No doubt," she continued, "you're very anxious to&#xD;
hear about Laura. Poor Laura! Mi'. Ludlow; I suppose&#xD;
you know, is dead. No! Well it is so. Poor man, he&#xD;
made away with himself very suddenly and now Laura&#xD;
your old flame is a heiress. I don't know how many&#xD;
thousand dollars she's worth, I'm such a poor hand at&#xD;
recollecting figures, but Mr. Van Horn, I think he said,&#xD;
if I ain't mistaken, that it was a very large fortune.&#xD;
There's lots after her, you may be sure. She's got as&#xD;

ma-ny beaux as you can shake a stick at, but your chaiice&#xD;
is the best. She thinks a good deal of you, Garry, and&#xD;
often mentions your name. Last Christmas-day, I think&#xD;
it was, when she was here she saw Dennis have on that&#xD;
blue satin scarf of yours that you gave him before you&#xD;
left, and she recollected it directly, and says she,&#xD;
'Well,' says she, 'if that aint Garry's scarf that he felt&#xD;
so proud of;'-which only goes to show how her mind's&#xD;
running on you and how well the stuff wears, and I&#xD;
think with that beard of yours, and you're manly look-&#xD;
ing now, too, that you nmy succeed-and what do you&#xD;
think! you recollect Mrs. Robinson?. Widow Robinson&#xD;
that was ?-well she's now NVidow Smith, only four&#xD;
months ago lie died, and there's money there too, so I&#xD;
tell Dr. Rose he and the widow had better make a&#xD;
match at last, and talking of matches d~d you know&#xD;
Nyndert was in love? Yes, LAced he is! to M~s&#xD;
Home, a sweet nice girl, but I'm afraid he won't suit&#xD;
her, he's too close and not particular enough about his&#xD;
dress and hair. 11cr father's a Scotebman too, or a-&#xD;
Spaniard is itt? Let me see-Spaniards are dark and lean,&#xD;
aint they? No, it can't be for he's fat and red-fhced.&#xD;
She's an acquaintance of Laura's, they wont to Sooner&#xD;
Ladronni's singing-school together, and so she wanted to&#xD;
see a ship-launch and Laura took her to Nyndert's Ship-&#xD;
yard and that's the way it all came about. Myndert&#xD;
goes there quite often and I shouldn't wonder if it was a&#xD;
~e, but I don't know," etc. etc.&#xD;
Banishing any lingering feeling of acrimony I went to&#xD;
see Myndert. As he had stated in his letters he was now&#xD;
a master ship~wrht. His first xvGrk, a pilot boat which&#xD;
&#xD;
he had built on the model of the little "Gallinipper,"&#xD;
proved so swift and staunch a sea-craft as to acquire for&#xD;
him a very favorable reputation as a builder. H~ next&#xD;
constructed the hull of a hudson river steamboat; and&#xD;
afterwards a ship for the Black Ball line of Liverpool&#xD;
packets, both of which so far surpassed their owners'&#xD;
expectations as to procure him several important con-&#xD;
tracts. He had achieved much success in reintroducing&#xD;
with modifications a plan of construction gone out of&#xD;
favor with naval architects, i. e. that of "hollow lines,"&#xD;
which replaced the heavy bulging bows, once considered&#xD;
so essential to th~ streno'th of a vessel, by neat con-&#xD;
cave ones, therel~'y increasing a vessel's speed and&#xD;
beauty without in the least impairing her force of resist-&#xD;
ance. Myndert was not one to follow in beaten l)aths.&#xD;
Success never satisfied him, but only spurred him on to&#xD;
improvement.&#xD;
his yard was at Corlear's Hook, amidst those foun-&#xD;
dries, boiler-shops, spar-yards, and other hives of human&#xD;
industry that cluster on the elbow of the East hive:',&#xD;
opposite to N\Tallabout and the Naval arsenal.&#xD;
It was a fine sunny day when I went there, and the&#xD;
scene of ceaseless industry and music of labom filled me&#xD;
with exhilaration. Myndert was not in his office and a&#xD;
carpenter said, without stopping from work, that I&#xD;
*       should find him somewhere about th~ yard.&#xD;
*          On the stocks was a large Indiaman, not entirely corn-&#xD;
pleted but with her planking on. There lay her colossal&#xD;
hull, and high above, her stem, smooth and sharp as a&#xD;
bird's~ beak, sprang out in a graceful curve, tipped, sin-&#xD;
gularly enough, with an old-fashioned besom. Surely&#xD;
next to woman and the horse, a ship is the most attrac-&#xD;

&#xD;
tive thing in the world to manly eyes. It is a majestic&#xD;
combination of strength, symmetry, and utility; a&#xD;
unison of a~ll that pleases and all that we wonder at in a&#xD;
blade of wheat and in a IDoric column.&#xD;
And Myndert was the magician who conjured that&#xD;
grand and splendid shape into reality; and his the&#xD;
master-mind that moved these hands to creation. For&#xD;
a moment a pang of envy shot through me ,-of pardon-&#xD;
able envy, for while the elder born of my father's house,&#xD;
the dull son, was reaping the meed of his perseverance,&#xD;
labor, and study; I, the hope of the family, was-&#xD;
naught!&#xD;
high up on the scaffolding near the stern of the ship&#xD;
was a man in a black coat, whom I recognised at once&#xD;
as Myndert. He was patting the ship as if he loved it,&#xD;
scanning each timber with a vigilant eye, and watching&#xD;
the progress of the work as if it were to be his master-&#xD;
piece-his favorite child. After some words with one&#xD;
of the workmen, he. took a maul and swung it himself,&#xD;
driving in the locust tree-nai1s with a vigor that be-&#xD;
tokened a labor of love. Happy fellow! for happy in-&#xD;
deed is he who can combine not only profit, but plea-&#xD;
sure, with the toil that man is doomed to nnder~o.&#xD;
Happening to look down he espied me, and instantly&#xD;
descended and advanced to meet me with the light of&#xD;
fraternal love beaming in his eyes. I am sure he wished&#xD;
as heartily as I did to break the bounds of our silly, un-&#xD;
natural conventionahism, and to clasp each other warmly&#xD;
as brother meeting brother would in any country in the&#xD;
world but England and our own.&#xD;
We retired to his office and there made that close&#xD;
scrutiny of each other's appearance consequent upon&#xD;
&#xD;
long separation. I was brown and fleshy. Myndert&#xD;
was tall and broad-shouldered, his former long, loose-&#xD;
jointed frame having expanded into solid squareness&#xD;
covered with firm, thick muscles. He much resembled&#xD;
our father. lie had the same clear, true, steady gaze,&#xD;
and when it met mine, my heart warmed towards him,&#xD;
and proud of my brother, I rejoiced in his talent and&#xD;
success.&#xD;
And now came a long conversatio~ between us.&#xD;
Mine was a checkered story, and Myndert had so many&#xD;
questions to ask, the most of them rather puzzling, as&#xD;
his curiosity lay chiefly in different matters from those&#xD;
that had engaged the attention of my epicurean self.&#xD;
"What a beautiful ship you are building, Myndert,"&#xD;
I remarked.&#xD;
"Yes," replied he; "Ithink so. She's somewhat of&#xD;
an innovation on established models. Her lines ar~&#xD;
peculiar. I am building her for Uncle Garry. It was&#xD;
with great difficulty I could get him to accept my plans.&#xD;
Old Captain Bunker, who is to command her, and&#xD;
owns a sixteenth or some such share, I believe, objected&#xD;
to my ideas most obstinately. Of course Uncle Garry&#xD;
lays great weight on the Captain's opinion, and it was&#xD;
only by certain conditional concessions in the price and&#xD;
by guarantee, that they allowed me to have my own&#xD;
way about it. captain Bunker comes here every morn-&#xD;
ing, shakes his head, and swears she'll never stand a&#xD;
typhoon, but go right down plumb as a deep-sea lead.&#xD;
I laugh and tell him, that if he will only stow her cargo&#xD;
as it should be, I will spar her so that he will be safer&#xD;
on board of her in the wildest hurricane than he would&#xD;
be in the staunchest, old. kettle-bottom galliot out of&#xD;

Amsterdam. Captain says nothing, bra looks as if&#xD;
he might be repeating to himself 'Vouno' folks think&#xD;
old folks fools, but old folks know young ones to be&#xD;
so.' I've great faith in her, and shall be very much&#xD;
disappointed if she don't rove my words good. I'm&#xD;
partial, to be sure; but she seems to my eye to be as&#xD;
shapely and as well poised as a salmon."&#xD;
"That's a queer Ilgure.kead she's got. What is it, a&#xD;
broom ?"&#xD;
"Yes, a broom. She's to be christened the Van&#xD;
Tromp, you see, in honor of the old Dutch admiral,&#xD;
It's my fancy. Uncle Garry wanted to name her the&#xD;
'Integrity,' or the 'Punctuality,' or some such stupid&#xD;
name; but I persuaded him to let me have my own&#xD;
way about it by promising to furnish her with a set of&#xD;
colors and signals at my own expense."&#xD;
"That induced him, no doubt. I suppose he drove a&#xD;
pretty close bargain with you, didn't he ?"&#xD;
"Well-no-not exactly. He has sense enough to&#xD;
know, that if you xvant a good article you n4ist pay a&#xD;
fair price for it. Uncle Garry is not the close illiberal&#xD;
man you take him to be, more's the pity, for your sake,&#xD;
Young Depeyster is out of the firm. Ab, yes! you&#xD;
know that, for it happened before you left. Well, he's&#xD;
going to the dogs now fast enough, what with drink and&#xD;
other things. Pity you didn't stick to Uncle Garry's&#xD;
shop; you might have been a partner there by this&#xD;
time, as that cunning little Otter is to be shortly, I&#xD;
understand."&#xD;
"By the by, Myndert, Aunt Jane told. me something&#xD;
about your efforts to enter into a partnership,-~-a life&#xD;
one-how about that ?"&#xD;
4'&#xD;
&#xD;
Myndert blushed like bashful fifteen, and said,&#xD;
"how?" as if he did not understand.&#xD;
"Ah-ah! plead guilty, eli? The name IA, I believe,&#xD;
Miss-Miss Home; is that it ?"&#xD;
"Oh-ah !-Miss Home. She's a very pleasant young&#xD;
lady. I must introduce you. What do you intend I~o&#xD;
do now, Garry ?"&#xD;
"I intend to call on Dr. Rose this evening; further, I&#xD;
' cannot say."&#xD;
I did call on Dr. Rose, who appeared much pleased to&#xD;
see me. lIe must have prospered during my absence&#xD;
for he now occupied elegant apartments fronting on St.&#xD;
John's Park, and his shirt was studded with diamonds&#xD;
big as marrowfat peas. I thanked him for his kindness&#xD;
in sending me the one hundred dollars, and began an&#xD;
elaborate apology for not having repaid it. "My dear&#xD;
Garry, don't mention it-don't mention it. Reep it as&#xD;
long as you like-I don't need it. It's safe enough I&#xD;
know. You can pay me back out of your abundance&#xD;
when the harvest is garn~red-ha !-ha! But I'm so&#xD;
delighted to see you back. You've got a story as long&#xD;
as your arm to tell me, I don't doubt. I tell you what,&#xD;
Van, we must have a quiet little dinner of the old sort to&#xD;
talk over matters and celebrate this return. Just you and&#xD;
I and ~yndei't. Say four o'clock to-morrow, if you're&#xD;
not otherwise- engaged, at Coquelicot's. Tell Myndert&#xD;
for n-ic, or better still I'll write him a note in the mor-&#xD;
ning. Remember four to-morrow. That will give us&#xD;
time, if we like, to go and hear that new singer Tedesco&#xD;

the little dinner party. Monsieur endeavored, politely&#xD;
to refuse. "Why not? Why will you not come, you&#xD;
have not lost your taste for a good bottle of wine ?"&#xD;
"For to tell you frankly, sir, Ii am not in a position&#xD;
presently to respond at the politenesses that you make&#xD;
to me," said Mons. Rivois slightly reddening. "Thus&#xD;
you will conceive that the delicateness obliges me to&#xD;
refuse that which I would have in another case ninch&#xD;
of pleasure in accepting."&#xD;
"Come-come--without ceremony, my dear Sir, sans&#xD;
fapon. You must go. Your old pupils will be there,&#xD;
and Garry will be oveijoyed to see you. Friendship&#xD;
obliges, in this case."&#xD;
"Since it is thus, I accept. To-morrow then at four,&#xD;
you say? Good, I will be there."&#xD;
At the time appointed we assembled in a private room&#xD;
of that famous restaurant Coquelicot, and sat down to a&#xD;
comfortable little ~repast that would not have suffered in&#xD;
comparison with a spread at the Caf~ Anglais. Old&#xD;
Mons. Rivois was less springy than of yore, and had a&#xD;
red tinge on his nose; his frock-coat, the same he had&#xD;
worn for years, was brushed threadbare and white at the&#xD;
seams. Poor man! he had lost nearly all employment.&#xD;
He was unfit now for school-teaching, not stern enough&#xD;
for boys and not fine enough for young ladies. So&#xD;
Annette was obliged to ply the needle faster and work&#xD;
earlier and later, while her father, in awaiting scholars ,&#xD;
resorted to the cafes and imbibed hope from the bluest&#xD;
and most ordinary of clarets. We had a long conversa-&#xD;
tion together in ~?French about Paris, the army, ithe&#xD;
Dumesnil family, etc. etc. And how had I liked Paris?&#xD;
~with a triumphant smile). And had I been to the&#xD;
&#xD;
Vari~t6s? What actors were in vogue now? This&#xD;
led to a discussion on that truly Parisian topic, the&#xD;
theatres. I told him all about Pr6d6ric Lemaitre,&#xD;
Levassor, Bouff6, Arnal, Virginie Dejazet, Rose Cheri,&#xD;
and Rachel; but the old man pooli-poohed these with&#xD;
reminiscences of Potier, Brunet, Talma, and M'lle&#xD;
Mars. "Those were actors, sctpristi! as one sees no&#xD;
more. Fill tby glass," and the old man was young&#xD;
again for an hour or two, sang-&#xD;
&#xD;
"The wicked are all water drinkers,&#xD;
The Deluge proves that true enough,"&#xD;
&#xD;
and other convivial songs in a cracked and husky voice.&#xD;
The wine soon flushed him, as it did the others, for the&#xD;
Doctor was unsparing in his attention~ to his guests&#xD;
and Plied them with the choicest Burgundy and Cham-&#xD;
pagne. Even grave Myndert showed th6 subtle effects&#xD;
of grape-juice and laughed immoderately at Doctor&#xD;
Rose's flashing wit. Monsieur Rivois n his enthusiasm&#xD;
called me his compatriot, his brave of the braves, and&#xD;
swore roundly that I had acquired the allurements of an&#xD;
old "jackal." "But after all, see you, though there has&#xD;
been made some pretty feats-of-arms in Alger, such as&#xD;
the taking of Constantine and the battle of Isly, it i~&#xD;
nothing to what we old soldiers of the Empire were&#xD;
accustomed to. It was altogether. another thing then."&#xD;
As he punctuated his conversation with many brimmers&#xD;
he had by this time warmed himself into a fine phrensy&#xD;
of enthusiasm, and rang out the glories of Jena, Wagrain&#xD;
and Friedland, and then, by a natural transition, began&#xD;
to rail at the English. "1~snez I" cried he, with a&#xD;
thump on the table that made the glasses dance. "I&#xD;

could again raise the sabre against those rascals of Eng-&#xD;

of imprisoning the Emperor."&#xD;
"It is the greatest compliment," said Myi~dert, '~ that&#xD;
was ever paid to him or any other mane It showed how&#xD;
he was feared."&#xD;
"Compliment !" exclaimed NI. Rivois with another&#xD;
thump. "You call that a compliment? It is pretty the&#xD;
compliment! Take a poor devil of an emperor who&#xD;
himself renders and plant him 6n a rock in the middle&#xD;
of the sea, la! him putting, so to say, in a cage like a&#xD;

are now in France, not one, but two hundred thousand&#xD;
men, young and old, who would take the arms to-morrow&#xD;
and swim the 3fan~he to sweep those traitors of English&#xD;
as Brune swept them from the Low Countries."&#xD;
"What's the reason," inquired the Doctor with a&#xD;
wink at me, "that your countrymen and the English&#xD;
hate each other so&#xD;
"Speaking frankly, here is the reason. We are&#xD;
rivals; is it not? And w~ell, we are too nearly equal.&#xD;
I don't say that the advantage is not of our side; but,&#xD;
let us pass that-what is evident is, that being all the&#xD;
two of such great peoples, one cannot with reason miS-&#xD;
prise the other; here is all. If one could misprise the&#xD;
other, ab! in~ that case all would march well and in&#xD;
p~a~C~ but as it is impossible in the state of things, that&#xD;
&#xD;
we should be other than rivals, we are in con;;~cjuence&#xD;
enemies. It must be admitted that the soldier EuxiibiI&#xD;
is solid and brave, a2d it 15 1mpO5~iblC to iuis;~ri~e o~&#xD;
£&#xD;
such men."&#xD;
"Very true," said the Doctor coolly igniting the&#xD;
veteran's indignation. "They proved that by beating&#xD;
you at Waterloo."&#xD;
"Vatterlow-Vatterlow! Q~&amp;amp;e disable, are you chant-&#xD;
ing me about your Vatterlow! Let me be with your&#xD;
Vatterloxv, Am I never to hear the end of your sacred&#xD;
Vatterlow !" Rivois bristled, his cycs struck fire, arid&#xD;
his very hair stood exasperated. "Non~ lJfon.sieur!&#xD;
We beateci the Anglishe at Vatterlow. It is true that&#xD;
Blulkair fell on us with a force so much superior that&#xD;
we were obliged to-to"&#xD;
"To retreat," said the Doctor, supplying the ob-&#xD;
noxious word, "But how about the charge of the&#xD;
Guards, oh? 'Up boys and at 'em,' and all that, you&#xD;
know ?" continued he, with provoking calmness.&#xD;
"To the d~.cd1e wis your up bodies an ratteni! NVhat&#xD;
nonsense is that ?" ci'ied Rivois, in a semi-frantic state,&#xD;
and he stuttered away to prove conclusively that the&#xD;
French had won the battle of Waterloo, and that if&#xD;
Grouchy had done this, and Blucher had not done that,&#xD;
and if the French army had not been composed chiefly&#xD;
of recruits, and if the others had only been but twice as&#xD;
numerous, and if something else had happened, or had&#xD;
not happened, why, sir-why, the matter would not&#xD;
only have terminated differently; but the world, Mon-&#xD;
sicur, the world, would be now three centuries ahead!&#xD;

clothes, and more adown hi~ gullet, for ho didn't get&#xD;
such drink every day. And still the merciles~ Doctor&#xD;
egged him on, while I was convulsed with vinaceous&#xD;
mirth. Myndert, true to his Dutch blood, had so per-&#xD;
sistently indulged in some spirits to settle the claret as&#xD;
to have reached the solemn stage of inebriety, and sat&#xD;
smoking with oxvl-like gravity, oblivious of surrounding&#xD;
scenes. Presently Monsieur Rivois having exhausted&#xD;
himself and his fourth bottle, succumbed to the com-&#xD;
bined influence of Bacchus and Bellona, and slid away&#xD;
under the mahogany to take a quiet nap. The Doctor,&#xD;
who seemed alcohol-proof said to me, "Wait a little&#xD;
we'll have some fun with the old Frenchman," and&#xD;
charring a cork he decorated the prostrate Frank with&#xD;
a pair ~ fierce, voluted mustachios; then proper4 him&#xD;
up in a corner, clapped on his head a cocked hat made&#xD;
of a folded newspaper, and tying two napkins round&#xD;
his waist for a sash, stuck therein a knife and a fork.&#xD;
"There's a bold trencherman! A valiant leg-o'-mutton&#xD;
knight !" cried the Doctor, whilst I, screaming with&#xD;
laughter, app~audecI the joke so frantically with a&#xD;
decanter, that I shivo~ed it and broke a leaf of Mr.&#xD;
Coquelicot's table.&#xD;
Myndert was far too much befogged to notice any-&#xD;
thing; and after the Doctor and I had sufficiently&#xD;
enjoyed the ludicrous spectacle which the tipsy old&#xD;
fellow afforded, we sent for a hackney coach and tum-&#xD;
bled him into it. Arrived at Rivois' house in Hudson&#xD;
street, I remained in the coach while the Doctor&#xD;
lugged the helpless Frenchman up his door-steps, laid&#xD;
him down and rang the bell. I looked back as we&#xD;
were driving around the street corner, and saw the&#xD;
&#xD;
daughter Annette trying to raise her drunken father,&#xD;
and take him into the house,&#xD;
"If I hadn't been so dmmk I wouldn't have permitted&#xD;
it," said Myndert, bluntly, th6 next day, as I was laughing&#xD;
over our fun of the previous evening. "It was a poor&#xD;
joke. lie's an old man, old enough to be your grand-&#xD;
father. The Doctor ought certainly to apologise. When,&#xD;
wine's in wit's out, sure enough."&#xD;
This rebuke was also meant in a certain degree for&#xD;
myself; but I pretended not to take it, having come to&#xD;
borrow a little money.&#xD;
"I don't like that Doctor much, Garry."&#xD;
" And why not ?"&#xD;
"Because there's no earnestness in him. I'm preju-&#xD;
diced against such folks. He is clever and generous I&#xD;
will admit; but he has a malicious way with him that I&#xD;
can't well describe b~it that has set me against him,&#xD;
lately."&#xD;
"The Doctor has his faults to be s-nrc; but he's been&#xD;
a good friend to me, an&amp;amp;an amusing one," said I, "and&#xD;
that's all I care about."&#xD;
"Of course," said Myndert; "I don't dispute that.&#xD;
It's a mere matter of taste."&#xD;
My brother seemed in rather an ill-humor that morn-&#xD;
ing; so not thinking it a favorable moment to ask for&#xD;
the little loan I needed, I ceased the conversation, and&#xD;
left him,&#xD;
And this was the sequel to the little dinner party.&#xD;
Monsieur Rivois sought the Doctor, and met him talk-&#xD;
ing to a friend on the Astor House steps. Approach-&#xD;
ing the Doctor with a jaunty air, he said, "Ah,&#xD;

fj~rcer! you have played m~ a pretty trick, is it not?&#xD;
row-at my turn," and he gave him a smart buffet on&#xD;
the side of his face.&#xD;
The Doctor quelled fo~ an instant, but recovering&#xD;
himself, said with a very pale face: "It is fortunate,&#xD;
sir, that your gray hairs and maimed condition protect&#xD;
you, otherwise I should take the pleasure of horse-&#xD;

"It must not that Monsieur permits any trifles to&#xD;

take~ I am at his service, and hope to have some of&#xD;
his news soon." And with a military salute to the by-&#xD;
standers the old soldier departed.&#xD;
Monsieur Rose, however, did not deem it necessary&#xD;
to respond to Monsieur Rivois' invitation. "Look at&#xD;
it, Van, what honor could I get by shooting the impu~&#xD;
dent old pauper ?" said he. "Besides, it isn't a fair&#xD;
thing. I'm no shot; couldn't hit a barn-door at five&#xD;
paces; and if it came to swords, I know even less of&#xD;
them; and that cut-throat could assassinate me at his&#xD;
ease. But for all that, I wouldn't mind calling him out&#xD;
were it not that I belong, as you probably know, to a&#xD;
- Qi~aker family, and you can imagine how completely&#xD;
blasted my reputation would be among my relations ;~&#xD;
how completely they would shun me, did I in any way&#xD;
engage in a duel; and worse yet, between you and me, my&#xD;
rich uncle in Philadelphia, old Obadiah Day, from whom&#xD;
I expect something handsome, would discard me com-&#xD;
pletely, cut me off with abhorrence-sure as you exist !"&#xD;
I told some friends afterwards of the Doctor's reasons&#xD;
for not fighting duels, and about his Quaker principles,&#xD;
etc., and we had much fun over it for a long time.&#xD;
&#xD;
1Vfonsi~ur Rivois not receiving thee expected cartel&#xD;
grew indignant. "The poltroon! must I challenge him&#xD;
myself?" and he sent a polite note stating that not&#xD;
hearing from Dr. Rose though he had patiently waited a&#xD;
long time, he supposed that a natural diffidence pre~&#xD;
vented him (the Dr.) from taking the initiative, but now&#xD;
he confidently expected from his knowledge of Monsieur&#xD;
the Doctor's accommodating spirit that he would gladly&#xD;
meet him, etc. etc. As this missive met with no answer,&#xD;
the irate Freiichman again sought the Doctor and pro-&#xD;
ceeded to cane him in the street. Rose wrenched away&#xD;
from the old man's grasp and ran o11 Rivois chased&#xD;
him a square or two, when- a policeman interfered, and.&#xD;
as Rivois turned his wrath on the guardian of the peace&#xD;
and attempted to flagellate him also, he was arrested and&#xD;
conveyed to the Tombs, 'in whose umbrageous solitudes&#xD;
he might have made an unpleasantly long sojourn but&#xD;
for the intervention of his old pupil Myndert.&#xD;

LAURA LUDLOW.&#xD;
'6JTis full six weeks, six weeks! Garret Van Horn,&#xD;
I since you returned and you haven't been to see&#xD;
Laura yet. What will she think of it? Now why&#xD;
don't you go to Marshall's Neck ?" said Aunt Jane.&#xD;
"True, aunt, and the blackfish must bite now; I can&#xD;
have some capi1~al sport off Finch's Island reef."&#xD;
"What, fishing! Do you think of fishing? 0, Garry,&#xD;
don't let this opportunity slip away. Here's a nice girl&#xD;
and lots of money, all to be had for the asking. And I&#xD;
should so like to see you settle down and be steady&#xD;
now; you've roamed about so much."&#xD;
"Well, well, we'll see about that, Aunt Jane. Any-&#xD;
way I must call on Laura, I suppose," replied I, rathei'&#xD;
flattered with the idea that an heiress was at my dis~&#xD;
posal.&#xD;
I went to Marshall's Neck to see Laura~ Not that&#xD;

j&#xD;
&#xD;
there remained a shred of my boyish passion; not that&#xD;
J ~Vas influenced, 'in the least, thereto by my aunt's&#xD;
advice, but simply in curiosity to see how a change of&#xD;
position and advancing summers had altered the friend&#xD;
and sweetheart of my youthful days.&#xD;
Laura's father was dead but eighteen months, having&#xD;
perished in a singular and lamentable way. Once a dry-&#xD;
goods jobber he had retired with a large fortune to ~&#xD;
country-seat in Connecticut. Here surrounded by all&#xD;
the comforts and luxuries that wealth could bestow, it&#xD;
might be supposed that he passed a halcyon existence.&#xD;
Would not you or I, if we had txx~enty thousand a year&#xD;
income, honorably earned, a handsome mansion, horses,&#xD;
pictures, books, and the capacity to enjoy them? But&#xD;
Mr. Ludlow was not happy. Some malignant sorcerer&#xD;
had cast baneful spells over the man. All joy was ban-&#xD;
ished from his heart, and he became moody, dejected,&#xD;
and sad. And it was, of all things, the dread of poverty&#xD;
that unceasingly tormented this rich man. He was&#xD;
beset continually by visionary disasters that assuihed&#xD;
protean shapes. At all hours and in every place did&#xD;
some malicious imp whisper in his ear that all his goods&#xD;
and gold would some moment vanish like a dream, and&#xD;
leave him to sharp want and hunger! that let him feast&#xD;
as he would, and array himself in fine garments, yet&#xD;
surely, surely, would he die a tattered pauper; neglected,&#xD;
starving, and unknown I Such black thoughts embittered&#xD;
every enjoyment, and but ashes and aloes did all the&#xD;
delights of this world prove to him. He bent his will to&#xD;
shake the horrid phantasm off, but his morbid reason&#xD;
was too feeble to exert any effectual resistance. His&#xD;
nerVous system became so shattered that a fldl in the&#xD;

stock market or a slight depreciation Li the value of real&#xD;
estate sufficed to throw him into a state of mental agi-&#xD;
tation and distress pitiable to see. Eventually the fail-&#xD;
nrc of a debtor was the cause of his death. The loss&#xD;
was a small one, but he saw in it the commencement of&#xD;
his predestined doom-the first crumbling of his for-&#xD;
tune-now the fhtal moment was approaching, and&#xD;
ruin and beggary were soon to stare him in the face!&#xD;
Crazed by such torturing thoughts he deliberately shot&#xD;
himself; a victim to that worst of all maladies, a mind&#xD;
diseased.&#xD;
La-nra continued to reside at the family mansion&#xD;
together with some poor relations of her father's,&#xD;
who took charge of the household and managed the&#xD;
firm.&#xD;
I found the young ladygrown tall and about as stately&#xD;
as a bean-stake. Her ~axen ringlets-they were golden&#xD;
once-were longer and more numerous; her eyes-once&#xD;
heavenly and cerulean-expressionless; and her coin-&#xD;
plexion-once alabaster----now pallid and wan; and she&#xD;
bore a remarkable resemblance, which I had never&#xD;
before noticed, to her aunt Mrs. Van Horn.&#xD;
She had still the same taste for low-necked dresses&#xD;
and short sleeves, which afforded now but a. display of&#xD;
meagre charms, and though attired in the deepest&#xD;
mourning she wore on her long, bare arms, two gold&#xD;
bracelets as heavy as handcuffs.&#xD;
With an air of melancholy resignation, something&#xD;
like the expression of a lithographed St. Catherine, and&#xD;
a feeble sigh, she received my greeting at our first in-&#xD;
terview and said; "Many years have rolled away and&#xD;
C&#xD;
&#xD;
GAIUU~T VA~ i1ol~&#xD;
&#xD;
193&#xD;
&#xD;
many changes have occurred since last we met, Garry-&#xD;
Mr. Van Horn, I mean."&#xD;
"Yes," answered I, thinking she alluded to the loss of&#xD;
her Lather.&#xD;
"It has doubtless been the same with you that advan-&#xD;
cing years serve but to reveal the hollowness of the&#xD;
world, and efface all the bright anticipations of the&#xD;
future which we cherished in earlier days. All I seek&#xD;
at present, and all I long for, is an asylum, secluded from&#xD;
the heartlessness and selfishness of the inhabitants of&#xD;
this globe, where I can find sweet repose and peaceful&#xD;
meditations."&#xD;
During this speech she rolled her eyes upward and&#xD;
crossed her hands before her in a very devout way.&#xD;
Thinking that perhaps she was still suffering from her&#xD;
afflicting Loss, I expressed some phrases of consolation.&#xD;
Then sh~ continued in the same mournful strain: "In&#xD;
childhood's frivolous, hours, Mr. Van Horn, we cherished&#xD;
worldly attachments and 1 hope that you are honorable&#xD;
enough not to presume upon, or to attach the slightest&#xD;
importance-that is to say-it's a delicate subject to&#xD;
mention,-but I am sure that you will at once see the&#xD;
justice, and your sense of honor will at once, I trust,&#xD;
impel you to release me instantly and unconditionally&#xD;
from any promise or any encouragement I have ever&#xD;
been foolish enough to give in days that are past."&#xD;
Having no recollecti6~h of any promises given by her&#xD;
my acquittauce was readily granted.&#xD;
"We were so young and foolish you know, Garry,~-&#xD;
I mean Mr. Van Horn."&#xD;
"Very true, and now we are old and foolish," said I&#xD;
cheerfully.&#xD;

"What a vast difference a few yeitrs make in our&#xD;
travels in this vale of tears,. don't it, Mr. Van Horn ?"&#xD;
"But don't you find it damp walking for thin shoes in&#xD;
this vale ?" inquired J, with as much wit ~s I could&#xD;
muster, for I was getting amused. But Laura had no&#xD;
relish for jokes and never understood them.&#xD;
"As I have the highest opinion of your discretion, and&#xD;
~s I believe you to bc one of those who redeem the&#xD;
unfeeling population of this sphere, and possess a sympa-&#xD;
thizing nature, I don't mind being candid with you, but&#xD;
pray, don't mention it to any one I beseech you."&#xD;
"Not for the world, what is it ?"&#xD;
"Well then, to speak plainly and without reserve, I&#xD;
will confide in ~ou that I have resolved to forsake all&#xD;
frivolity and retire from the vanities of this world."&#xD;
"Retire!" said I surprised; "where to ?"&#xD;
"To the only asylum left to one weary of this world&#xD;
and its hollow deceptions."&#xD;
"What asylum, pray, the Orphans' ?"&#xD;
"Can you not divine? What other shield or solace&#xD;
have I left to me but the veil ?"&#xD;
"The veil! You don't mean to say that you seri-&#xD;
ously intend to go into a convent ?"&#xD;
"Question me no further, Garret, I have already said&#xD;
perhaps more than I should. There was a time,-but&#xD;
never mind-.-.the die is cast-pray, don't, don't question&#xD;
me any more, my line of duty is plainly traced and I&#xD;
have no desire to swerve from it, nor can I be shaken in&#xD;
the slightest degree from my firm and deliberate w~&#xD;

&#xD;
Just then we were interrupted by Mrs. Hobby,&#xD;
Laura's paternal aunt, who came into the room and&#xD;
engaged me in conversation about Mrs. Van Horn.&#xD;
When Laura had left us alone together, Mrs. hobby&#xD;
gave me some particulars about her niece's whim. "She&#xD;
tells me," said that worthy dame, "that she's too fragyle&#xD;
to bear the contact of this rude world and that her only&#xD;
hope's a cloistral cell. I tell her my opinion is she'd get&#xD;
along well enough if she'd only-ia little more flesh on her&#xD;
bones, for shQ don't eat a most nothing. IDear me, I'm&#xD;
so worried about her, I'm so afraid of her getting like&#xD;
her pool father was that I've a strong notion of speaking&#xD;
to the doctor."&#xD;
I ~Iissipatcd the old lady's fears as well as I could, and&#xD;
suggested that a change of air and scene would likely&#xD;
enough drive away all of Laura's gloominess. "Let her&#xD;
spend next winter in town, Mrs. Hobby, I think you will&#xD;
find that an effectual remedy."&#xD;
Mrs. Hobby thanked me for my advice, and said s e&#xD;
would try and induce Laura to follow it.&#xD;
I stayed over night and the next day for the purpo e&#xD;
of fishing with Elkanah, Mrs. Hobby's son, who knew&#xD;
the best fishing grounds.&#xD;
"Try and make Laura go with you, Mr. V~n Horn,"&#xD;
said Mrs. hobby; "I shouldn't wonder if it did her a&#xD;
great deal of good to go out on the water and enjoy&#xD;
herself a little."&#xD;
Of course I did not Ihucy that proposal, what fisher-&#xD;
man would? Nevertheless I said, "By all means-she&#xD;
must go," and, after a little entreaty Laura consented to&#xD;
accompany us. So I caught no fish, for Laura wanted&#xD;
so much attention th.at between baiting her hooks, get-&#xD;

&#xD;
ting her line out of tangle, doing this and doing that, I&#xD;
hadn't a moment to myself; but Elkanah, who was a&#xD;
sharp Yankee youth, kept himself aloof at the bow of&#xD;
the boat and captured a fine string of heavy blackfish&#xD;
just to mortify me. However, I had my revenge on&#xD;
Laura, for she got terribly sun-burnt in spite of her pre-&#xD;
cautions, and did not come down to the breakfast table&#xD;
the next morning in consequence. I asked Mrs. Hobby&#xD;
if her niece were unwell?&#xD;
"0, no, not exactly unwell, but her face got so scorch-&#xD;
ed from the sun yesterday, that she's quite in a pet about&#xD;
it this morning."&#xD;
"And she'll lay it all to you, Mr. Van Horn," said&#xD;
Elkanah, "for coaxing her to go out on the water, and&#xD;
she'll not forgive you in a hurry, for she's 'been getting&#xD;
up that pale white face for the nunnery by fasting, read-&#xD;
ing nights, vinegar, and cold potatoes for I don't know&#xD;
long."&#xD;
Under those circumstances I thought it best to return&#xD;
to New York, the ill-humor of the monastic Laura&#xD;
offering no inducement to prolong my stay beneath her&#xD;
roof.&#xD;
When I arrived home, Aunt Jane, among a multitude&#xD;
of questions about the Connecticut folks, Mrs. Hobby,&#xD;
Elkanah, and Laura, asked m~ if the last-mentioned one&#xD;
had spoken to me about her intention of retiring to a&#xD;
convent. "It all comes," said Aunt Jane with indigna-&#xD;
tion, "of a hairy artist. He was some sort of a man, a&#xD;
Seener somebody or other, a Frenchman, I believe ho&#xD;
was or an Italian, or a foreigner of some sort, I don't&#xD;

A 3IO~GST other change~ that had occurred during my&#xD;
11 absence was the surprising o~ie of my sfaid, old-&#xD;
4&#xD;
school uncle's transferring his domicile from plain, unpre-&#xD;
tentious, secluded Madison street, to the aristocratic and&#xD;
fashionable neighborhood of University Place. This&#xD;
was a change long desired and long entreated for in&#xD;
vain by his wife, and only brought about in consequence&#xD;
of the East Dutch Church's having' been removed from&#xD;
the lower to the upper part of the city. how this latter&#xD;
event was effected would take a volume to explain, and&#xD;
I have not the space to narrate the diplomacy, the&#xD;
intrigues, the strategy, the pluck, the Machiavelism&#xD;
displayed by the chm'ch-memlers in their contest for and&#xD;
against the i'emoval. The strife was a long and a des-&#xD;

aggressive~ were headed by the rich and fashionable Mrs.&#xD;
Queezy (who always came to worship in her carriage),&#xD;
and the other party, the conservatives, were under the&#xD;
leadership of Un&amp;amp;~e Garret. The progressives argued&#xD;
that the congregation was diminishing in number s and.&#xD;
needed transplanting to flourish anew, they asked, there-&#xD;
fore, that the old edifice be sold and a finer one erect-&#xD;
ed in a more favorable locality. Uncle Garret and&#xD;
his party insisted that the church should remain where&#xD;
it was, and said that their opponents' plea was a shallow&#xD;
one. Uncle Garret fought every inch like a true soldier,&#xD;
but nnfortuuately, the conservatives were in the minority,&#xD;
and as Mrs. Van Horn se~retiy favored the enemy, while&#xD;
the Rev. Dr. Westervelt leaned towards the progres-&#xD;
sives, and Mrs. Qucezy announced her readiness to con-&#xD;
tribute a large sum from her own purse to purchase the&#xD;
new site; Uncle Garret and the coiiservatives were van-&#xD;
quished, and the time-honored East Dutch temple ~of&#xD;
worship was moved from its old grave-yard and the&#xD;
bones and ashes of by-gone commumeants and placed&#xD;
amidst the luxurious mansions of the Fifth Avenue. So&#xD;
Uncle Gariiet was perforce obliged to follow, and bought&#xD;
a dwelling in University Place at a great bargain of a&#xD;
builder whose necessities impelled him to a sacrifice.&#xD;
They had but just moved into this new house when I&#xD;
returned from Europe, and Aunt Jane was busily en-&#xD;
gaged in the furnishing and decorating of it, in which&#xD;
task she ~vas efficiently guided by the superior taste of&#xD;
Dr. Rose. For all his aid she found her undertaking&#xD;
difficult and tedious, for, as she graphically observed to&#xD;
me, i~ was like drawing teeth to get money from Mr.&#xD;

Mrs. Va~i Horn would begin: "There is one thing we&#xD;
certainly ought to have, my dear."&#xD;
"Another 1" exclaimed Mr. Van Horn,&#xD;
"Now, don't begin, dear. It's only an article,"&#xD;
"Judging by the bills I receive daily from uphol..&#xD;
sterers and furniture men, I should think you had&#xD;
purchased every thing necessary and much that is un-&#xD;
necessary, and yet there is one thing more !"&#xD;
"My dear, it is only a teapot."&#xD;
~ "A teapot! well and what has become of our old tea.&#xD;
pot ?"&#xD;
"A silver one, my love."&#xD;
"Why silver? why will not Pritannia metal answer?&#xD;
We have drunk tea. now for twenty years out of 'china&#xD;
and pewter and why change? Will it taste any&#xD;
better ?"&#xD;
"I have long set my heart, dear, upon a silver tea-&#xD;
pot, and now you must gratify me for once, How&#xD;
ridiculous it would appear for people in our circumstan&#xD;
ces and living in the style we do, to set a shabby pewter&#xD;
tea-pot on our table before company."&#xD;
"There it is! there's the same nonsensical argument&#xD;
over again. I can tell you, Mrs. Van Iiori~, that if you&#xD;
keep on at this rate the teapot will be all in fact that&#xD;
you will have to set on the table before company. At&#xD;
first, it was ridiculous for people in our circumstances&#xD;
to live in Madison street and in such a shabby house and&#xD;
now that you have got this one, it is ridiculous to live&#xD;
in such a fine new house with old furniture, and so I've&#xD;
bought new furniture at a cost of-4'm afraid to think&#xD;
how much, and now you find that it is ridiculous to ha~ie&#xD;
the furniture without a silver teapot. I snppos~ if you&#xD;
&#xD;
had the teapot you'd find it ridiculous without the whole&#xD;
service."&#xD;
Such was in fact Mrs. Van Horn's drift but she pm.&#xD;
gently edged in but one article at a time.&#xD;
"No-no "-continued Mr. Van Horn, "this is too&#xD;
much. Think for a moment of the money I have&#xD;
already sunk in this house, money which not only pro.&#xD;
duces nothing but on the contrary necessitates constant&#xD;
and further outlay., Calculate the interest on this dead&#xD;
capital including the cost of your trinkets and jewels&#xD;
and the useless horses and carriage-say at seven per-&#xD;
cent per annum and see the large amount yearly lost that&#xD;
igight be so profitably employed in relieving distress,&#xD;
supporting missions, and otl*r benevolent things, instead&#xD;
of ministering 'to our worldliness and vanity. And yet&#xD;
you would have me sink more."&#xD;
"Mrs. Queezy"&#xD;
"Pray don't mention Mrs. Q~eezy to me, Mrs. Van&#xD;
Horn. ~A lady who professes to be a Christian and yet&#xD;
rides to church in her carriage, thereby compelling her&#xD;
coachman and horses to work on the Lord's day, can&#xD;
surely be no example or pattern to any one."&#xD;
"But, my dear, every one has these things. If we&#xD;
couldn't afford it, I certainly wouldn't ask it. The&#xD;
Sinchews have a breakfast.serviee in silver, with a large&#xD;
urn besides the tea-set, and the Madopolams, and&#xD;
"There-there - if the Sinchews and the Madopo-&#xD;
lains have them, why, there's no resisting that argu-&#xD;
ment," said Mr. Van Horn with resignation. "With&#xD;
such splendid fools to lead, we can but humbly follow."&#xD;
And so Mrs. Van Horn gained her suit and the tea~&#xD;

service, and her husband left for his offlee, prophesying&#xD;
inwardly that he would be teased the next week4'or a&#xD;
gold dinner set.&#xD;
The new house was built on the English model, and&#xD;
contained, as the builder said, all the "modern improve-&#xD;
ments;" but though much finer in appearance it was far&#xD;
less comfortable than the snug, old-fashioned, roomy&#xD;
dwelling in Madison street. Uncle Garret felt amid all&#xD;
this splendor like, to use a vulgar simile, a cat in a&#xD;
strange garret. The Spirit of Unrest hovered con-&#xD;
tinually around his devoted head. Unused to the&#xD;
"modern improvements," they weighed like an incubus&#xD;
on his mind. He had vague ideas of the combustive&#xD;
and explosive properties of gas, and would arise from&#xD;
his couch at dead of night and wander from room to&#xD;
room sniffing at the burners to ascertain if they were&#xD;
properly closed. The first winter the water in the&#xD;
meter froze, and utter darkness came over th~i house,&#xD;
Now, behold Uncle Garret, Dennis, and Bridget the&#xD;
cook in the cellar, with a kettle of boiling water and a&#xD;
lighted candle. And they drenched the meter, and&#xD;
they filled it, and took out the top screw, and the side&#xD;
screw, and the bottom screw, and poured in gallon on&#xD;
gallon, but the gas came not forth, and at last with&#xD;
wrench and hammer the meter was detached from the&#xD;
pipe and laid on the kitchen range to thaw; when, in a&#xD;
few moments, it being charged with gas, it burst like a&#xD;
shell, maiming poor Bridget and prostrating Uncle&#xD;
Garret. Thenceforth he dave to spermaceti, and&#xD;
banished gas for ever. Nor was this the end of his&#xD;
troubles, for the frost cracked the lead conduits, so that&#xD;

&#xD;
the water leaked through the parlor ceiling, detaching&#xD;
portions of the frescoes and ruining the carpets, and&#xD;
careless plumbers caine for repairs, who stood on satin-&#xD;
covered chairs, rudely knocked holes in the walls, and&#xD;
filled the expensive lace curtains with lime-dust. Then&#xD;
the heat from the patent furnace warped all the wood-&#xD;
work, so that the windows had to be pried open with&#xD;
pokers, and the doors could not be shut without the&#xD;
joiners' assistance. In fact, such were the trouble and&#xD;
annoyance incurred by Mr. Van Jiorn in his elegant&#xD;
residence, that he endeavored to purchase back his old&#xD;
one, and almost yielded to the extortionate demands of&#xD;
~ the new owner,&#xD;
Neither was Mrs. Van Horn as contented with all this&#xD;
magi~ificence as one would suppose; and though her&#xD;
long cherished desire for a prominent position in&#xD;
fashionable circles was within her reach, and Mr. Van&#xD;
horn, yielding to her importunities, now allowed her to&#xD;
mingle in all the social gaieties of the wealthy, ~et&#xD;
even this seemed not to bring the expected pleasure.&#xD;
How she had changed! Once a cheerful, equable&#xD;
matron, a bustling, careful housewife, kind and good-&#xD;
natured to all; and now peevish, irritable and fitful as&#xD;
the wind. There were moments when she was almost&#xD;
as wild with trivial joy as a school-girl, and again she&#xD;
had long periods of dejection which even Dr. Rose, who&#xD;
came frequently, with his agreeable conversation and&#xD;
fine flow of spirits failed to dissipate. All this was the&#xD;
more remarkable in a woman of her mature age. There&#xD;
was surely some concealed thorn pressed occasionally to&#xD;
the quick, whose infliction she strove to hide from the&#xD;
world. I detected her several times in tears, and this&#xD;

&#xD;
and other circumstances confirmed my suspicions that&#xD;
my aunt did not live happily with her husband; for, in&#xD;
addition to a disparity of tastes, the insularity of the&#xD;
husband's emotions, his dry heart, his reticence, and&#xD;
total devotion to money-making, were but calculated to&#xD;
repulse the affection of a warm, yearning nature, It is&#xD;
true he was never unkind to her; never aggressively so.&#xD;
No words of anger or bitter chiding had she ever heard&#xD;
from his lips. Nor could she cor~plain of his parsimony,&#xD;
for Mr. Van~JJorn, though as true a Man3mon~worship&#xD;
per as ever lived, was far from being a miser, and his&#xD;
wife could command almost everything in the power of&#xD;
wealth to bestow. But, he could not give her that&#xD;
which he had not. His heart knew no such emotion as&#xD;
love. He felt towards her but a passive, respectful&#xD;
partiality, for she was his wife, endowed with all his&#xD;
worldly goods, and entitled to his regard, care, and&#xD;
protection. She had accepted him, let us avow it, be-&#xD;
* cause being a poor seamstress the offer was an advan-&#xD;
tageous one; and she would have learnt to love him&#xD;
had she found a reciprocal tendency on his part. But&#xD;
she met none. He never thawed. He had married&#xD;
her to obtain a home, for a home was comfort and quiet,&#xD;
and comfort and quiet realized his idea of pleasure.&#xD;
He had acquired these. Mrs. Van Horn had conducted&#xD;
to this pleasant state of things, and so they resided in&#xD;
amity and peace together.&#xD;
And yet, how was it that while they had so long&#xD;
lived in seeming concord and contentuient, it was but&#xD;
now, at this late hour, that .the wife exhibited any signs&#xD;
of leading an unhappy and embittered existence?&#xD;
This I could not account for.&#xD;
&#xD;
GARRET VAN HORN.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
To me, Mrs. Van Horn had certainly been as kind as&#xD;
a mother, and perhaps did love me quite as much as&#xD;
if I were in reality her son; whilst I could not be other-&#xD;
~vise than strongly attached to her, for she had always&#xD;
sought to contribute to my happiness, and did now&#xD;
furnish me with money, that very necessary and de-&#xD;
sirable thing to one of my profession, i. e. that of a&#xD;
gentleman of elegant leisure. With me Shakspeare's&#xD;
third and fourth ages had been transposed, and crc I&#xD;
wrote sonnets to eye-brows and sighed like a furnace,&#xD;
ambition had died within me, and. I was left in the semi-&#xD;
apathetic state of one awaiting the turn of Fortune's&#xD;
wheel which is to cast an unearned fortulie in his lap.&#xD;
A state it was of anticipations, dreams, plans for the&#xD;
future, repose, and smoking; in short, what poets call&#xD;
lotus-eating, Italians the sweet do-nothing, and ignorant&#xD;
people laziness. To rise at nine or so, read the news-&#xD;
papers or a novel, then a lounge till dinner-time calling&#xD;
on tailor or bootmaker; after dinner another saunter&#xD;
and cigar; at evening dressing for play or party, wind-&#xD;
ing off with billiards, brandy and water, and smoking&#xD;
until three or four o'clock in the morning; passing my&#xD;
time in embellishing my person, getting into debt,&#xD;
and quaffing the waves of pleasure as they floated to&#xD;
my lips. This was the life I led, with, as chief comrade&#xD;
and sharer in its delights, the Doctor, the elegant and&#xD;
distinguished Doctor Rose! To be sure, I had by this&#xD;
time discovered that that man had many vicious traits&#xD;
of character; that he was an unprincipled profligate and&#xD;
us nmate cajoler; but what of that? lie had never&#xD;
injured me, that I was aware of, but on the contrary&#xD;
had ever manifested a very friendly spirit towards me.&#xD;

&#xD;
Why then should I cast stones at him? I wa~ not over&#xD;
virtuous myself; and besides, he was the most agreeable&#xD;
and diverting companion I had ever met with, so I ex-&#xD;
cused him from acts that I would have condemned in&#xD;
others. Such is human nature. Had we been bottle-&#xD;
companions of Nero, Caligula, ileliogabalus, or those&#xD;
other fine 61d Roman gentlemen of the Decadence, we&#xD;
doubtless would have viewed their pastimes in a far&#xD;
different and less odious light than mere strangers&#xD;

"It is now exactly five months and eleven days, sir,&#xD;
since you returned, and I have not as yet had any inti-&#xD;
mation of how you intend to dispose of the balance of&#xD;
your valuable life," said Uncle Garret to me.&#xD;
"Really, sir," I replied, "I cannot say I have&#xD;
bestowed much thought upon it myself; and am await-&#xD;
ing your pleasure and instructions."&#xD;
"It may be superfluous ko mention," he continued,&#xD;
looking displeased at my flippant way, "that you have&#xD;
not only wasted muehtime and money, but also acquired,&#xD;
during your absence in foreign lands, sundry expensive&#xD;
and irregular habits; but nevertheless I do so, in the&#xD;
hope that you will reform, as it is absolutely necessary&#xD;
you should if you wish to remain on good terms with&#xD;
me. Once for all, Garret, you must turn over a new&#xD;
Jeaf or we must part. Understand this. I will show&#xD;
no favor nor give any assistance to any one leading a&#xD;
life, of indolence and frivolity. Now, I have a proposal&#xD;
to make to you. I 'nay probably be able to procure&#xD;
you a situation in an institution, in Wall street, of which&#xD;

Something in his eye told me that the alternative was&#xD;
a complete disruption between himself and nephew, so I&#xD;
was wise enough to answer 111 the a1Th~mative.&#xD;
And when he had left the room, Aunt Jane continued&#xD;
on her side to exhort inc to industry and steady habits,&#xD;
hinting also at the great satist1~ction it wouki give her&#xD;
to see me, now that I had arrived at man's estate,&#xD;
wedded to her niece Laura, and settled in life. I told&#xD;
her plainly that Laura was not to my taste, and mar-&#xD;
riage with her entirely out of the question. Then she&#xD;
conchideci with that ~iaiz~c frankness which characterized&#xD;
her: "AnyxiTay, Garry, do try and keep on the right&#xD;

N ow you find me clerk at a salary of one thousand&#xD;
dollars a year in the employ of the Gotham Trust&#xD;
and Banking Company, No Wall street. This&#xD;
banking company having played an important part&#xD;
among the moneyed institutions of the "street" it may&#xD;
be well to recount its origin and rise. Who projected&#xD;
it, do you suppose? Some astute financier, think you?&#xD;
Nothing of the kind, nobody, in fact, but a little grub-&#xD;
bing pettifogger named Mieklethwaite, who fishing&#xD;
about for some scheme to replenish his pockets and&#xD;
launch him into notoriety had hit upon a plan for a bank-&#xD;
ing Company, with unusual and profitable privileges,&#xD;
which he submitted to Mr. Van horn with the propo-&#xD;
sal to obtain a valid charter for such an institution as he&#xD;
possessed some political influence with the party then&#xD;
in power. Mr. Van Horn cautiously studied the pros&#xD;
&#xD;
L&#xD;
&#xD;
GAIU~BT VA ~' 3IOi~T.209&#xD;
&#xD;
ject and conferred with a few other capitalists about it.&#xD;
The result was that Mioklethwaite, furnished with the&#xD;
needful money, was sent to Albany to procure the char-&#xD;
tei'. lie had no difficulty in engaging the votes of the&#xD;
city members who, after a little "salooning," were&#xD;
ready to oblige Tommy Micklethwaite in anything,&#xD;
but the legislators from the rural districts/were more&#xD;
conscientious. They had an inflated idea of their posi-&#xD;
tion anti liked to examine into things, and, in short,&#xD;
were not to be bought without something substantial.&#xD;
So Tommy Mickletliwaite had to fee handsomely enough&#xD;
of these to serve his purpose, and then, having secured&#xD;
the necessary majority, he pulled the strings, the read-&#xD;
ings were hurried through, the Governor's signature&#xD;
affixed, and Micklethwaite caine back to New York in&#xD;
triumphant possession of the valuable charter.&#xD;
The subscription books of the Gotham Trust and&#xD;
Banking Co. were now opened, and the stock taken by&#xD;
Mr. Van horn and his friends, who began operations by&#xD;
instituting themselves directors of the concern. Mick-&#xD;
lethwaite was rewarded with the appointment of counsel&#xD;
to the company which brought him at once into, repute&#xD;
as an able and responsible lawyer. Mr. Van horn&#xD;
being the largest shareholder and ruling spirit, -selected&#xD;
the officers as best beseemed him. Mr. Pennefether, a&#xD;
cleik of his, he made treasurer for the purpose of having&#xD;
some one in that important position entirely devoted to&#xD;
his interests. The presidency heofi'ered to Mr. Amasa&#xD;
Kemtop, a retired merchant, not on account of any&#xD;
fitijess that gentleman had for the post, but simply&#xD;
because he h~id more money than usually falls to the lot&#xD;

fore buttress the company with additional responsibility.&#xD;
So important a personage as Mr. Kerntop should not be&#xD;
passed lightly by, for lie ranked among the "merchant&#xD;
princes." us money he had made ostensibly by selling&#xD;
butter and cheese, but in reality, by speculations in&#xD;
stocks, his system being to oppose the popular current&#xD;
and purchase when everybody else wanted to sell and&#xD;
realize when others were buying. Following this rule&#xD;
he had made a m~nt of money. lIe was an ignorant&#xD;
man, and above all a pompous and ambitious one, loving&#xD;
fame or notoriety (which Th the same thing) even beyond&#xD;
money, let us give him credit for that, and therein he dif-&#xD;
fered from Mr. Van horn, who would by far have prefer-&#xD;
red a duke's rent-roll to his coronet, while Amasa would&#xD;
gladly have resigned all the emoluments for the sake of&#xD;
the title and position. Many were the efforts he had made&#xD;
to be popular and talked about. Ho had been elected&#xD;
alderman from his ward, which lie had represented with&#xD;
much dignity in the municipal councils, and likewise&#xD;
Alms House commissionere. But even this ~ilid not satisfy&#xD;
him. Then he built a most wonderful house, a coun-&#xD;
terpart of the Villa PizzicattP near Florence, costing&#xD;
$266,423 (builders McGoflln &amp;amp; Co., architect Bricks), so&#xD;
the newspapers said, of which the door-plate, door-knob,&#xD;
hinges, and bell-pull were of solid gold! protected from&#xD;
robbers l~y an ingenious mechanism designed to alarm*&#xD;
the household. Myriads came to look at these wonder-&#xD;
ful door-trimmings, and the owner's renown spread from&#xD;
Aristook to the Sabine. Such fame would be gratifying&#xD;
to any man's feelings, and Mr. Kemtop felt as if he were&#xD;
reaping the reward of a well-spent life. But unfortu-&#xD;
nately, the ingenious mechanism got out of order at the&#xD;
&#xD;
very time it was most needed, and "Sydney Bill," an&#xD;
expert English cracksman, wrenched off the door-plate&#xD;
and knob with a jimmy and decamped with Mr. Kern-&#xD;
top's grandeur. No way daunted, A. Kemtop, Esq.,&#xD;
Lady, family, and three servants went to Europe, and&#xD;
we soon learnt through the papers that lie had offered&#xD;
the Tuscan government a half million dollars for the&#xD;
Venus de' Medici-quarter cash and the balance in the&#xD;
sinldng-fitncl bonds of the Munnisunk Valley Railroad-&#xD;
which liberal offer the government refused to accept.&#xD;
But lie bought at Dusseldorf a "Prometheus Bound,"&#xD;
size 15 x 20 feet, for eighty thousand dollars (newspa-&#xD;
pers again), which was exhibited on its arrival at a&#xD;
picttirc-shop in Broadway. Everybody went to see this&#xD;
great work of art, and steel-plate engravings of the&#xD;
same were sold in abundance, so that at least one&#xD;
thousand miless had a copy on paper of the great&#xD;
canvas original which hung in Mr. Amasa Kemtop's&#xD;
gallery of pictures and "statuary," as he called it. But&#xD;
restless ambition still urged him on, the laurels of Mil-&#xD;
tiades would not let him sleep, and~he sighed for greater&#xD;
distinction. Like all conceited men he had a great&#xD;
opinion of his administrative abilities and fancied that&#xD;
the post 6f president of some bank or similar institu-&#xD;
tion would exactly suit him, it being an easy honorary&#xD;
sort of a position with nothing to do and entitling a&#xD;
man to much respect, consideration, politeness, and&#xD;
fawning. So Mr. Kemtop was delighted to accept the&#xD;
presidency of the Gotham Trust and Banking Company&#xD;
at a small salary, and to subscribe for a large amount of&#xD;
the stock, and Mr. Van Horn, on his part, was well satis-&#xD;
fLed with such an arrangement as it would leave the&#xD;

&#xD;
government of the institution entirely to him and his&#xD;
satellite Pennefether. Thus, with such a wealthy and&#xD;
therefore respectable man as Mr. Kemtop at the helm,&#xD;
and sundry other equally wealthy and respectable men&#xD;
as conners, the company sailed at once into popular&#xD;
favor. Thpir business consisted chiefly in receiving&#xD;
money on deposit, allowing a small rate of interest on it,&#xD;
and lending the same money at as high an advance as&#xD;
possible. They also undertook to negotiate state loans&#xD;
and brought out the well-known Oregon Internal Im-&#xD;
provement Debt. Such success did they meet with, that&#xD;
at the end of six months they declared and paid a divi-&#xD;
dend of eight per centum out of the profits realized.&#xD;
This indicating a prosperous state of affi~irs created a&#xD;
demand for the shares, which demand, being judiciously&#xD;
fostered by Mr.. Van horn, who caused two brokers to&#xD;
make fictitious sales and purchases at the "Board,"&#xD;
raised the price of shares to twenty and even thirty per&#xD;
cent. premium. At this point Mr. Van Horn gradually&#xD;
disposed of one-half of his interest thereby netting a&#xD;
gain of some ten thousand dollars. Most of the direc-&#xD;
tors took advantage of the rise to sell and thus made&#xD;
hay while the sun shone. Xor was this all the profit&#xD;
these gentlemen pocketed, for it must not be supposed&#xD;
that their time and service~ were gratuitously given.&#xD;
By no means, for each of the directory held a loan from&#xD;
the company equal to, if not exceeding, his portion of&#xD;
the capital. Mr. Van Horn, in particular, had made a&#xD;
handsome thing by ridding himself, at a large price, of&#xD;
some western lands; the purchase money being accoin-&#xD;
modatingly furnished by the company who took a mort-&#xD;
gage on the lands and the bond of the buyer as security.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was during this flourishing condition of things,&#xD;
while deposits were flowing freely in from courts,&#xD;
estates, country bankers, and the confiding public gene-&#xD;
rally, that I was installed in the office of the Gotham&#xD;
Trust and Banking Co. Mr. Van horn merely said:&#xD;
"Mr. Kemtop, I am seeking some employment for .a&#xD;
nephew of mine, just returned from Europe. He writes&#xD;
a fair hand and has a little knowledge of accounts. I&#xD;
suppose you can find him something to do here, can't&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
"0, certainly," said obliging Mr. Kemtop. "Send&#xD;
him along, Mr. Van horn, and I dare say we'll find him a&#xD;
desk."&#xD;
So along I came the Monday following, and Mr. Pen-&#xD;
nef~ther (with whom I was already acquainted) intro-&#xD;
duced me to Mr. Kemtop who pompously gave me a&#xD;
finger to shake, and to Mr. Kemtop's eldest son, Stan-&#xD;
hope Kemtop the "actuary." What the actuary's&#xD;
duties were I never ascertained, for drawing his pay was&#xD;
about the only labor he ever performed to my know-&#xD;
ledge. But Stanhope had married the daughter of a&#xD;
rich old ~purmudgeon who would not part with a dollar&#xD;
while tli~e was a breath in his body, and consequently&#xD;
Stanhope had to be provided for until his father-in-law&#xD;
was put into the ground. The other clerks, I found,&#xD;
were also like myself, connections and prot6g6s of the&#xD;
directors and pensioners on the company.&#xD;
Tim suite of offices was handsomely fitted-up, and&#xD;
there was a sequestered bower where Mr. ICemtop sat&#xD;
three hours per diem in a thickly cushioned arm chair,&#xD;
cdewiiV1' tobacco,       papers, or giving audience&#xD;

monte. At two o'clock r.~. his carriage came for him,&#xD;
a splendidd one with large purple hammer-cloth, silver&#xD;
crest, men in livery, and rolled him away so majestically&#xD;
to his dinner in the -grand $26G,423~residence with the&#xD;
eighty thousand dollar picture and "statuary," with the&#xD;
Sevres china spittoons in the drawing-rooms, and the&#xD;
wonderful library where Mr. Kemtop took his post-&#xD;
prandial snooze, surrounded by his elegant unread books&#xD;
bearing on their covers the family escutcheon with the&#xD;
motto, " Virtute et V~dore." I caught him once in that&#xD;
elegant attitude, when, having to deliver a message&#xD;
which required his immediate attention, I entered his&#xD;
library or "study," unannounced. He lay in his dress-&#xD;
ing-gown fast asleep on a leather lounge, the Evening&#xD;
Gazette just dropping from his hand. All around him&#xD;
were shelves stocked with the wisdom of the world, with&#xD;
of sages, the o'em&#xD;
the lore                ~ of wits, and the inspired&#xD;
songs of poets, Homer, Esehylus, Dante, Montesquien,&#xD;
Cervantes, Locke, each stamped with a "crest "-that&#xD;
silly tag of vain minds-and the busts of Caesar, Sh~rk-&#xD;
speare, and Washington staring with stony orbs at the&#xD;
snoring fool beside them.&#xD;
Bnt to return to the Gotham Trust and Banking Com-&#xD;
pany. There were in its employ about twjce as many&#xD;
clerks as were needed, and yet nearly all were either inca-&#xD;
pables or idlers. There was also a colored man as porter,&#xD;
whose chief business was to brush clothes, black boots,&#xD;
carry about billets-doux, and buy apples for the clerks,&#xD;
or papers of "Mrs. Miller's fine-cut tobacco," for the&#xD;
president. My duties were exceedingly light and simple;&#xD;
I was, as it were, unattached to any particular post. I&#xD;
&#xD;
came about five minutes before the president did, read&#xD;
the papers, then discoursed about the fine arts or the&#xD;
fashions with Stanhope Kemtop, or perhaps, to oblige&#xD;
Penn efether, went on a short errand, then five minutes&#xD;
after the president left I lit h cigar and followed suit,&#xD;
and the only writing I over did was in attending to my&#xD;
own correspondence, which, by the bye, was wholly&#xD;
restricted to such purposes as making appointments,&#xD;
accepting invitations, and sending "regrets."&#xD;
The labor of the office, in fact, devolved almost en-&#xD;
tirely upon Mr. Pennefether, and to do him justice he&#xD;
accomplished it with great ability; but, as out of all the&#xD;
employed there was hardly one capable of affording him&#xD;
any efficient assistance he wanted to procure somebody&#xD;
competent to advise and aid, or, if need be, to replace&#xD;
him at an emergency. The directory acquiescing in this&#xD;
desire, he engaged an Englishman named hart, who was&#xD;
a thorough and able accountant. But Mr. Hart, though&#xD;
a quiet, industrious, intelligent, and reputable man, was&#xD;
unfortunate in the~ shape of his nose. He had scarcely&#xD;
been with us a fortnight when Mr. Van horn, for the&#xD;
first time, observed the peculiar nasal configuration of&#xD;
the new clerk. Instantly calling Pennefether into the&#xD;
directors' room, lie said: "Mr. Pennefether, isn't that&#xD;
man-that neW comer-A JEW 'i"&#xD;
Mr. Pennefether replied that he had made no inquiries&#xD;
on the subject, but he believed, that in truth, such was&#xD;
the case.&#xD;
"Knowing this, ho~v came you to engage him ?"&#xD;
inquired Mr. Van Horn.&#xD;
"11 didn't bestow a ~ought on his religion, lie&#xD;

&#xD;
and capability and I have found him a very effl~ient&#xD;
man."&#xD;
"That may all be. Still I put it to you as a business&#xD;
man, whether you think such a nose as that, calculated&#xD;
to inspire our dealers with confidence in the concern?&#xD;
I don't. I have no confidence in the race, Mr. Penne-&#xD;
fether, none whatever. They love money too well.&#xD;
Bear in mind how they robbed the Egyptians; and,"&#xD;
added he, with a dry cackle~'whici~NVas his nearest ap-&#xD;
proa~h to a laugh, "they haven't forgotten their old&#xD;
tricks yet."&#xD;
"Very well, Mr. Van horn, I shall inform Mr. Hart&#xD;
that he had better seek another situation at once."&#xD;
"Do so, Mr. Pennefether. And-ah----.-um-you need&#xD;
not intimate onr reasons-say simply that we shall not&#xD;
need his services after the first of next month. I have a&#xD;
young man in my eye that I think will suit you better.&#xD;
A highly respectable young man. I will send him to&#xD;
you."&#xD;
Very much amused was I at ~this little occurrence&#xD;
when Mr. Pennefether told me of it; and so was Doctor&#xD;
Rose when I related it to him. "And so," said the&#xD;
latter, "he thinks Jews love money too well, does&#xD;
he? lla-~--ha! Capital, indeed! That shows the dis-&#xD;
advantage of having a nose fashioned after those of the&#xD;
patriarchs, don't it? Methinks, Van, your uncle shows&#xD;
a similar antipathy to people who abstain from meat on&#xD;
Friday, don't he? Bless his old heart! just like him,&#xD;
too. It's good Christian hate-I like him for that.&#xD;
Begging his pardon, he's a glorious old hypocrite; ain't&#xD;
he, Van? But what of that, we're all hypocrites a~ud&#xD;
b.umbugs in one way or another, and doesn't the wisest&#xD;
&#xD;
~an that ever lived, that old sated sinner, Solomon,&#xD;
head the list in reproving sin? however, all the world's&#xD;
a hum, so make the most of it if you're wise," etc., etc.&#xD;
There was a charming frankness about the Doctor's&#xD;
speech that could not fail to please, and as I agreed with&#xD;
him we enjoyed a good long laugh over my uncle's&#xD;
Pharisecism.&#xD;
Accoi'dingly, Mr. Hart was obliged to trudge, and&#xD;
Mr. I-Tei~ry Ileber Lissom, the respectable young man&#xD;
that Mr. Van Horn had in his eye, came in his stead.&#xD;
Mr. Lissom was all that could be desired in the way&#xD;
of respectability. He was pale and near-sighted, and&#xD;
taught a Sunday-school class, lie wore neither hair on&#xD;
his visage nor rings on his fingers; his clothes were&#xD;
unassuming, his watch a silver one with a black ribbon&#xD;
guard, whereas Mr. Hart was much addicted to per-&#xD;
fumes and precious stones. This new clerk, likewise,&#xD;
abhorred tobacco, and was economical. When beggars&#xD;
came, instead of flinging them a sixpence as Mr. Hart&#xD;
would have done, he. questioned them kindly, ascer-&#xD;
tained their creeds, made a note of' their residences in&#xD;
his memorandum-book, and promised to visit them. In&#xD;
this way we got rid of many bothersome mendicants.&#xD;
Mr. Lissom was a favorite with Uncle Garret, who&#xD;
held him up to me as a model; but unfortunately, he&#xD;
proved a failure. Not in the way of respectability, be&#xD;
it understood, for there he rated Al, as the under-&#xD;
writers would say, but in book-keeping; for he was&#xD;
totally ignorant of that science,, and Mr. Pennefether&#xD;
would have far preferred that pure Caucasian Mr.&#xD;
Hart with his objectionable nose, to the new clerk and&#xD;
his manifold virtues,&#xD;

&#xD;
The other clerks, being a sad set, were envious of the&#xD;
immaculate Lissom and made a butt of him. They&#xD;
played all sorts of tricks at his expense. They stoic his&#xD;
"Christian Jutelligencer," and substituted "The Flash,"&#xD;
and put theatre-bills and playing-cards in his surtout&#xD;
pockets, to the great scandal of his serious sisters;&#xD;
they got him inserted in the directory as a bar~keepcr,&#xD;
and presented him with Byron's Don Juan, and tickets&#xD;
for raffles, balls, and sparring exhibitions. '~ As he took&#xD;
these jokes in good part we were'encouraged to more&#xD;
brilliant ones, and I caused to be advertised in the&#xD;
"Sun," that several good fighting dogs were wanted&#xD;
by Henry ileber Liss~om, No. -~ Wall street, in the&#xD;
office of the Gotham Trust and Banking Company. At&#xD;
least one hundred dogs of high and low degree were&#xD;
offered. To the first corners he was bland, and said&#xD;
affably that there must be some mistake; but as dog&#xD;
followed dog, and one bow-legged, crop-eared, square-&#xD;
jawed cur, with eyes like burnt holes in his skin; made&#xD;
a vicious snap at the Lissom calves, Henry ileber lost&#xD;
all patience and denounced the author of the joke as no&#xD;
gentlei~an. I was silly enough to' get angry at this,&#xD;
and swore that if he did not apologize, I would kick&#xD;
him. He did so, for I was much the stronger, and a&#xD;
nephew of Mr. Van Horn's. More shame to me, for&#xD;
Lissom was a kind, well-meaning fellow, worth, perhaps,&#xD;
to the world a dozen such vain bullies as I.&#xD;
One fine day, Myndert stopped in the ollice to see&#xD;
me. After a little preliminary talk he said, with an&#xD;
embarrassed air unusual to him, "I believe, Garry, I&#xD;
promised to introduce you to Miss home. Now, as I&#xD;
&#xD;
11&#xD;
&#xD;
am going there this eve ing, if you choose to accom.&#xD;
pany me, you may do s~" and he blushed like a culprit&#xD;
school-girl.&#xD;
'Calling on young ladies had been formerly so entirely&#xD;
out of Myndert's province or inclination, that I was&#xD;
amused at his proposal, and curious to see the fair one&#xD;
whose killing glances had brought 'down such heavy&#xD;
and stolid quarry, I accepted his invitation. The young&#xD;
lady lived at Bloomingdale, between two and three&#xD;
miles from Union Square, so we rode in a light waggon,&#xD;
and Myndert's nag being a speedy one we soon reached&#xD;
the house.&#xD;
The domestic informed us that Miss Home was not&#xD;
in, and we were about retreating when a loud, cheery&#xD;
voice arrested us. "Come in, Mr. Van Horn-come&#xD;
in, gentlemen." The speaker was Mr, Home, father of&#xD;
the young lady we came, to see, a stoutish man, rather&#xD;
advanced in years, and with an unmistakable Britannic&#xD;
appearance about his collar, cravat, and whiskers.&#xD;
"I am delighted, sir," he said to me, "to make the&#xD;
acquaintance of Mr. Van Horn's brother. I am sorry&#xD;
Lesbian is out. She's gone to a fancy fair, or something&#xD;
of that sort, at our church. You have had a dusty&#xD;
ride from town. Pray, what may I offer you? Shall&#xD;
it be a glass of sherry? I say sherry, as it's the best&#xD;
thing I have at present. James-bring sherry and&#xD;
sandwiches."&#xD;
"Nice spot and fine lawn you have, Mr. Home,"&#xD;
said I, feeling called upon to say something.&#xD;
"Aye. It 4. as good as any I've seen in this country.&#xD;
But the grass here don't possess that crispy, brilliant&#xD;
verdure and freshness which it has in England. I sent&#xD;

over for lawn-seed when I laid this place out; but for&#xD;
some reason or other, perhaps because the soil isn't&#xD;
congenial, or the climate not damp enough, it don't&#xD;
thrive as well as it should."&#xD;
The sherry was prime and I said so.&#xD;
"I'm glad you like it. It is good wine," said Mr.&#xD;
Home in his slow, positive way. "You seldom find&#xD;
anything like it here. I got it direct from Xeres.&#xD;
Americans, I remark, have but little knowledge of wines,&#xD;
and I am gratified to find on6 with an appreciative&#xD;
palate."&#xD;
What with talking, eating sandwiches, and drinking&#xD;
wine, an hour or two slipped quickly away, when Mr.&#xD;
Home drew his atch and recollected that he had&#xD;
promised his ughter to call at the fair for her.&#xD;
"If you will excuse me, gentlemen,' and make your-&#xD;
selves at home here, I won't be absent beyond a half.&#xD;
hour at the longest, but I promised my daughter I&#xD;
would certainly go for her, and when we return we can&#xD;
have a quiet rubber, if you choose."&#xD;
"But why disturb yourself; Mr. Home? Why can&#xD;
we not go ?" asked Myndert.&#xD;
"No-no-thank you, Mr. Van Horn, you'i~e very&#xD;
kind, I'm sure, but "-&#xD;
"No kindness at all about it," said Myndert. "Sit still,&#xD;
Mr. home. You'd have to draw on your boots and all&#xD;
that, and here we are all ready and wilihig to start,&#xD;
Pray let me anJ my brother go."&#xD;
"Well," said Mr. Home, who far preferred his easy&#xD;
chair to moving about at that hour, "if it would not be&#xD;
imposing too much on your good nature,"&#xD;
"No imposition at all," said Myndert, his face all joy,&#xD;
&#xD;
1J&#xD;
&#xD;
I;&#xD;
[4&#xD;
'ii&#xD;
f 4&#xD;
&#xD;
"quite the contrary, it's a great pleasure,~~~ And it was&#xD;
plain to see he spoke the truth.&#xD;
"Did you see," said Myndert to me, as we were on&#xD;
our way to the church, "did you notice that little girl&#xD;
who came running to ihe door when the man opened&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
"That homely little thing do you mean, with the white&#xD;
apron? Is that her sister ?"&#xD;
"Sister, no. It's a little child she took home about a&#xD;
year ago out of charity. Its father was a quarryman&#xD;
working hereabout-poor Irish folk-living in a wretch-&#xD;
ed shanty. The father was killed by a blast-the mother&#xD;
took the small-pox and died, and Miss Home, Garry,&#xD;
visited that woman when she was on her sick bed, dying&#xD;
of that frightful disease-brought her food, clothing,&#xD;
medicine, and what not-sent the physician and priest to&#xD;
her-and after she died, took the infant home where it&#xD;
now remains, as you saw, comfortably clad and well&#xD;
taken care of,"&#xD;
IIo-ho~-.--thought I-I see what's vanquished you, my&#xD;
dear brother, A ministering angel-piety, primness,&#xD;
~nd starch, middle-age, spectacles, and wisdom. With-&#xD;

The fair was held in the basement of an Episcopal&#xD;
church, a neat stone edifice built chiefly through Mr.&#xD;
jilome's liberality and exertions, on condition that Her&#xD;
Majesty of Great Britain should be remembered in the&#xD;
~crvicc as is customary in her dominions.&#xD;
The tables were attended by some young ladies of the&#xD;

&#xD;
passing grace and beauty surprised me! and. still more&#xD;
so the possibility that such a girl could entertain any&#xD;
partiality for an uncouth body like Myndert Van Horn.&#xD;
1J;e introduced me, however, with an air of joy and&#xD;
triumph ~poor misguided fellow!) to the beautiful damsel,&#xD;
and as he was soon after called away by an acquain-&#xD;
tance to circulate a ~grab-bag, I had a pleasant and&#xD;
intimate chat alon~ with her. "Yoa are hardly a&#xD;
stranger, Mr. Van Horn, for your brother has spoken to&#xD;
me so often about you," said she, "but you are alto-&#xD;
gether a different personage from what I had pictured&#xD;
to myself."&#xD;
"I hope a. more pleasing personage at all events, Miss&#xD;
Home."&#xD;
"I should never have taken you for Mr. Myndert's&#xD;
brother, or even for an American, you have so much th'e&#xD;
appearance of a foreigner. I hear you have been roam-&#xD;
ing about the world, Jivin~ in Paris, and now I suppose&#xD;
you baye grown so fastidious that you are pleased with&#xD;
nothing this poor country can offer."&#xD;
"0 yes, Miss Home, there is at least one thing here&#xD;
that pleases me beyond anything I have ever met else-&#xD;
where, an4 that is "-~---~--~&#xD;
"Never mind," she interposed with an arch glance,&#xD;
"I know very well what you intend to say for I've&#xD;
already diseevered that, like me, you are apt to say&#xD;
many things you don't mean. Now, were I not entirely&#xD;
satisfied that there isn't the least bit of vanity about&#xD;
you, I shouldn't tell you how anxious I have been to see&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"How can I,. Miss Ho-me, how could I be otherwise&#xD;
than vain at such an avowal from one SOr ~&#xD;
&#xD;
"Pray don't-hear me out. Exceedingly anxious,&#xD;
indeed, have I been to see you, but merely because I&#xD;
was curious to know if there were another such odd&#xD;
being in the world as Myndert Van Horn." -&#xD;
"Poor Myndert !"&#xD;
"Why 'poor? I don't see why he should be pitied in&#xD;
the least. I'm sure he affords me a deal of amusement&#xD;
which is more than many others do, particularly when&#xD;
he tries~to be elegant, for then hc~ appears so exceedingly&#xD;
uncomfortable. Do. look at him! lie has been bargain-&#xD;
ing for the last ten minutes ~vith Miss Wilson for a&#xD;
hair-brush. She tried him first with a bottle of rose-&#xD;
water, but he shook his head; she is more successful with&#xD;
t~e brush, but I suppose he finds the price too high.&#xD;
He's not going to be imposed upon. Did you ever see&#xD;
such monstrous gloves! Pray tell him the ladies notice&#xD;
with pain the discomfort those ai'ticles cause him, and&#xD;
while they appreciate the laudable feelings which prompt&#xD;
him to wear them, beg he will desist from torturing him-&#xD;
self in that inhuman manner for their sakes."&#xD;
"Hew merciless you are to your victims, Miss Home.&#xD;
I see now what I may expect."&#xD;
"It is impolite, not to say unkind in me to talk so of&#xD;
such a good-natured, obliging creature as Myndert Van&#xD;
Horn-but goodness me! I should be attending to my&#xD;
business and selling my wares. Do purchase some~&#xD;
thing ?"&#xD;
She spoke in a clear chest-voice that was music itself,&#xD;
with the English inflection which is a relief from our&#xD;
monotonous Yankee head-tones. Under cover of our&#xD;
unmeaning talk we were scrutinizing each other and she&#xD;
was doing a del of mischief with a pair of splendid&#xD;

&#xD;
black eyes. Not a pair of downcast, timid, soul-windows,&#xD;
but eyes that darted fire and fun into mine and said so&#xD;
plainly: I know very well you're' admiring me for I've&#xD;
encountered such looks as yours scores of times before,&#xD;
Doubtless she bad, and I was trying with all the elo-&#xD;
quence my poor optics were capable of, to inform her&#xD;
that I was her devoted slave and madly in love with&#xD;
her at first sight. Could I help it? Listen while I&#xD;
attempt a feeble portraiture of a beauty who would have&#xD;
made of Diogenes a fop, and of Cato a courtier.&#xD;
Lesbia Home was then hardly seventeen, but having&#xD;
been habituated to constant open-air exercise h~id grown&#xD;
tall and well-developed for her age. She was straight and&#xD;
graceful as an Tonic shaft, with a Corinthian luxuriance&#xD;
of lustrous dark haik, and a complexion, where the&#xD;
ardent bkod of &amp;amp;outh glowed richly through a transpa-&#xD;
rent white, not a delicate rosiness either; not lilies dip-&#xD;
ped in wine; but a damask bloom that overspread the&#xD;
round chin, the rims of two small ears, and with lighter&#xD;
hue, the palms of two plump hands; then eyes of spark-&#xD;
ling black, incendiary, marvellous eyes! fine teeth, and a&#xD;
milk-white throat. These, united to a symmetrical figure,&#xD;
were certainly charms enough to set any son of Adam&#xD;
distracted, and is it to be wondered at that flesh-and-&#xD;
blood Garret learnt in an instant to adore this handsome&#xD;
girl and to hate his brother in a corresponding measure?&#xD;
Hate him! aye, not only him but half a score of other&#xD;
offensive fellows who seemed to be on disagreeably inti-&#xD;
mate terms with her, and for whom I was totally neg-&#xD;
lected after she had sold me a sprig of geranium and a&#xD;
japonica bud for the sum of five dollars.&#xD;
I had no other opportunity for a t~te-~-t~te with her&#xD;
&#xD;
10*&#xD;
&#xD;
that evening, for the fair soon broke up and Myndert and&#xD;
I escorted her home, during which she monopolized the&#xD;
conversation. Mr. I-Tome was ready for whist and in-&#xD;
vited us to stay over night with him, but Myndert&#xD;
refused.&#xD;
"What do you think of Miss Home ?" were the first&#xD;
words he uttered as we were riding back to the city.&#xD;
"Isn't she amiable? Isn't she beautiful? And I tell&#xD;
you she's good as she's beautiful,". added he with a cut&#xD;
to his horse to emphasize that last declaration.&#xD;
"She's rather prepossessing," I replied, affecting a&#xD;
nonchalant air and lighting a cigar.&#xD;
"You should hear her sing, Garry, a nightingale's a&#xD;
fool to her! Eh, what are you doing? Not flinging&#xD;
away that flower she gave you? What-what !"&#xD;
"Why should I keep it? It's bothersome. You&#xD;
don't suppose I'm in love with the girl as you are ?"&#xD;
said I puffing away at my cigar. "Besides it's no gift.&#xD;
I bought it. Dear enough, too."&#xD;
Had Myndert been less obtuse in such matters, he&#xD;
might have discerned that his brother was ill-disposed&#xD;
to listen to his panegyrics of Miss Home, and that he&#xD;
was indeed far more inclined to quarrel with any one&#xD;
who made any pretensions to that young lady's special&#xD;
regard. But neither jealousy tior envy formed any part&#xD;
of Myndert's character, and therefore, while he escaped&#xD;
much of the irritation and vexation of life, he lost that&#xD;
penetration which these vices bestow.&#xD;
Let lhere be but ever so little of the serpent in us and&#xD;
we'll get some of hi~ xvisdon~ as ~vell.&#xD;

GARRET VAN HORN.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
~fflE HOMES.&#xD;
A ROHTBALI H0~nv, Esq., the father of Miss Lesbia,&#xD;
was the second son of Donald Home, cotton&#xD;
spinner, of Glasgow. Rather servile occupation, you&#xD;
will say, for a lineal descendant of one of the "Seven&#xD;
Spears of Wetterburn;" but, as in this degenerate age,&#xD;
"The Percy deals in coals,&#xD;
The Douglas in red-herrings,"&#xD;
why may not ~ Home in six-cord cabled sewing-thread?&#xD;
For all that, Donald the spinner had succeeded' in&#xD;
winning the hand of Katherine, fourth daughter of&#xD;
Lord Cuthbert Marshmallow, in return for having&#xD;
nobly lifted a heavy mortgage from the Marshmallow&#xD;
estates. From his union with this lady sprang three&#xD;
sons: Cuthbert, the eldest, who entered the Fusilier&#xD;
Guards; Archibald and Allan. Archibald, the second&#xD;
&#xD;
son, received the appointment of ll.B.M.'s consul at&#xD;
Cadiz, where he resided for several years, and married&#xD;
a native lady who bore him one child, a daughter,&#xD;
christened Lesbia by the chaplain of H.B.M's frigate&#xD;
Consternation (then in. Cadiz harbor), after her ances~&#xD;
tress, Lady Lesbia Marshmallow, the great beauty of&#xD;
Charles the Second's reign, and re-christened by her&#xD;
mother's directions, and according to the ritual of the&#xD;
Roman ~atholie church, not in that heathenish appella~&#xD;
tion, but in the more appropriate and respectable pre~&#xD;
nornens of Isabel, Mercedes, Dolores, Luisa, and Juanita.&#xD;
This proceeding on the part of Sei~ora Home was the&#xD;
beginning of a series of differences between herself and.&#xD;
spouse, which lasted, with but little intermission, until&#xD;
she died, spine three years after her daughter's birth.&#xD;
The~i Mr. ~tlome, fearful lest his child should be enticed.&#xD;
by her mother's relatives into the pale of Holy Mother&#xD;
Church, and believing that salvation was only attain-&#xD;
able with certainty through the Church of England and&#xD;
its Thirty-Nine Articles, sent her to London and. eon-&#xD;
signed her to the care of an old. maiden grand-aunt, the&#xD;
Hon. Miss Eleanor hay, who resided there. Here&#xD;
Lesbian remained. until her thirteenth year. Meanwhile,&#xD;
Mr. Home had resigned his consulship to conduct a&#xD;
branch house of Home, McLeod &amp;amp; Co. (successors to&#xD;
Donald home &amp;amp; Co.) in New York; and having&#xD;
definitely settled. himself in, that city he sent for his&#xD;
daughter, and for a trusty English house-keeper to&#xD;
accompany h~r and to take charge of the new home.&#xD;
Mr. home was a thorough Scot both by birth and&#xD;
feeling, and no less a loyal subject of the young Queen.&#xD;

&#xD;
open pocket, and besides an enthusiastic lover of every.&#xD;
thing English or Scotch, he was, in consequence, a&#xD;
great favorite with all his countrymen. He was presi-&#xD;
dent of thd St. Andrew's Society, chairman of Burns&#xD;
dinners, a manager of Thistle balls, and, in short, spared&#xD;
himself in nothing that could conduce to keep alive a&#xD;
patriotic flame for the Land o' Cakes. But he loved&#xD;
England also; for he looked upon that country as an&#xD;
appanage of his own, and firmly thought all Britain's&#xD;
glory due to the enterprise and intellect of Scotsmen;&#xD;
and when I add, that he believed tartan the most&#xD;
becoming wear for the human family; the skirl of the&#xD;
bagpipes the sweetest music; cairugorms the finest&#xD;
gems,. Burns the greatest poet, Scott the greatest&#xD;
novelist, Wallace the greatest hero, and the admirable&#xD;
Crichton the greatest man that ever existed; why, I&#xD;
think enough has been said to indicate Mr. Home's pre-&#xD;
judices and proclivities to the sagacious reader's know~&#xD;
ledge.&#xD;
He lived, as was mentioned before, at Bloomingdale,&#xD;
in a large old-fashioned country dwelling which he had..&#xD;
leased for a number of years. He could not hold it in&#xD;
Lee-simple without becoming a citizen, and he was too&#xD;
loyal a liege of the British Crown to sacrifice his&#xD;
nationality for any such purpose; indeed, it was told to&#xD;
me, that when the lawyer prolYosed such a course to&#xD;
him, as he might have made a good bargain by buying&#xD;
the property in question, he actually took it as an&#xD;
insult.&#xD;
"Naturalized, Sir! What. do you mean, Sir ?"&#xD;
"It's merely a form," said the conveyancei, blandly.&#xD;
"A form, Sir; do you call that a form, Sir? Do you&#xD;
&#xD;
propose to Archibald Home, Sir, that he should for-&#xD;
swear his country and his gracious SOVEREIGN! Dam-&#xD;
mit, Sir! are you in earnest? Do you take me for a&#xD;
Frenchman or a Dutchman, that I should wish to be-&#xD;
come a snuffling Yankee !"&#xD;
"Don't be so hasty, Mr. Home," said the lawyer, "I&#xD;
meant no offence. I merely wish to inform you, that it&#xD;
is impossible for a foreigner to own real estate in our&#xD;
State without going through that formality."&#xD;
"Then I'll not buy it. No, Sir, I'll not go throi~gh&#xD;
that 'formality' as you call it to own all theland in this&#xD;
beggarly country," and he brought his cane down on&#xD;
the floor with an energy that betokened a desire to lay&#xD;
it across the lawyer's back.&#xD;
So he took a lease of the place, altered and ornamented&#xD;
it to suit his ideas of convenience and beauty, and called&#xD;
it "The Maples," in honor of two well-shaped maple-&#xD;
trees that flourished on the premises. Ift was situated&#xD;
just far enough away to escape the roar of the restless&#xD;
city, and had just land enough attached for stables,&#xD;
garden, and lawn. There was an Englishman, of&#xD;
course, for the stables, and a Scotchman, old Cluny, for&#xD;
the garden, and everything about the place was as tidy&#xD;
and comfortable as one could wish to have it.' Thus&#xD;
situated, and with a daughter he doted on, it was no&#xD;
wonder that Mr. Home was a happy and contented&#xD;
man, as he certainly deserved to be, for, as the saying&#xD;
is, there was not a mean hair in his head, not one, and&#xD;
his, face spoke that out to the satisfaction of all. You&#xD;
could not look at his genial countenance with the fresh,&#xD;
ruddy cheeks, red-pepper and salt whisker dimpled&#xD;
chin, and open bluish eye, without loving the man, more&#xD;

&#xD;
especially if you had already seen his daughter. Give&#xD;
that man five hundred thousand acres of land, a castle&#xD;
and a title, and you would have a model nobleman, and&#xD;
the kindest and most hospitable of landlords. His&#xD;
house and all in it would be at your service, provided&#xD;
you were of "good family ;" he would be a generous&#xD;
protector to his tenants and strive to make them all as&#xD;
happy and comfortable as circumstances would admit,&#xD;
provided always that they killed no foxes, snared no&#xD;
hares, nor set any night lines in the trout preserves.&#xD;
He would~raise the finest cattle and till the finest farms.&#xD;
He would be a just magistrate; a legislator ever faithful&#xD;
to the interests of his class; a staunch patriot; in short,&#xD;
a pillar of the state, and moreover, a powerful foe to the&#xD;
Rights of Man. His eldest son, the heir and Right&#xD;
Honorable, would probably be a dishonorable black-&#xD;
guard, for in the natural course of events every alter-&#xD;
nate lord of the manor would have to pay the penalty&#xD;
of possessing unearned wealth. But the greatest harm&#xD;
my lord, the model nobleman, wouki inflict on society,&#xD;
would be in his raising, besides fat bullocks and heavy&#xD;
wheat, a large crop of parasites, sycophants, toadies,&#xD;
tuft-hunters, and other varieties of the genus Snob, and&#xD;
another crop of servile, humble, imbruted otters Sir&#xD;
Roger de Coverley was a gentleman, no doubt, and&#xD;
Bracebridge Hall a goodly place to spend the Christmas&#xD;
holidays, but how about Hodge and Giles who toil and&#xD;
nioU and are kept in ignorance and leading strings, that&#xD;
the Squire and Sir Roger may hunt, shoot, and drink&#xD;
their tawny port in lazy dignity? Are those stupid&#xD;
chaw.bacons who whip off their hats Jike slaves when&#xD;
my lord passes by, and catch at ha'pence flung at them&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
greedily as beggars, free born Britons? or are they&#xD;
Russian serfs? Perhaps, though, the peerage is not so&#xD;
much the cause of snobbery as the wealth and privileges&#xD;
the peers possess. Stripped of all but their tinsel tags&#xD;
called titles, and reduced to penury, no one but a roman-&#xD;
tic school-girl would do them homage, but when their&#xD;
historic names are conjoined with console, broad acres and&#xD;
manor-houses, their grandeur is apparent and irresistible.&#xD;
:Nothing, iii fact, is left for us less favored mortals and&#xD;
poor proletarians, but to kneel, truckle, and become&#xD;
loyal flunkeys and admiring snobs.&#xD;
Mr. home had certainly a great veneration for "good&#xD;
or old families." To be sure he idolized Burns, knew&#xD;
his poetry by heart, and prated much about "a man's&#xD;
a man for a' that," hut he meant nothing by it, no more&#xD;
than you or 1, kind reader, for, gadzooks! how quick-&#xD;
ly either of us would, if possible, step into the shoes of&#xD;
his Grace of Northumberland and lord it as loftily&#xD;
as the best aristocrat among them. Compassionate,&#xD;
therefore, should we stern lovers of equality be, and&#xD;
as we have no hereditary titles in our happy land,&#xD;
let us confine ourselves ~to a decent respect for wealth,&#xD;
a deference which, being always accompanied with envy,&#xD;
is far less dangerous than the old-world one for birth and&#xD;
blood.&#xD;
And yet, singular as it may seem, Myndert Van Horn&#xD;
the hard-handed, was a favorite with the patrician&#xD;
Archibald Home, ~tnd a most welcome visitor at the&#xD;
Bloomingdale villa.&#xD;
Thh 'must have been entirely owing to the sympathy&#xD;
always existing between the honest, true, and single-&#xD;
minded, for surely there was but little compatibility or&#xD;

&#xD;
* similarity of ideas between them. Both were dogitiatic&#xD;
and prejudiced, and Myndert the democrat, who had&#xD;
nothing of the courtier about him, never attempted&#xD;
to disguise or withhold his antagonism to his host's&#xD;
cherished views on society and its organization. I re-&#xD;
member being much amused at Myndert's bluntness, on&#xD;
one oceasion,.when Mr. Home was telling us of a famous&#xD;
run he had with the Cambridgeshire hounds and do..&#xD;
scribing the ludicrous exasperation of. a farmer when&#xD;
the horses and dogs trampled through his young corn.&#xD;
"Ah, sir, it's royal sport, and has contributed greatly to&#xD;
our success as soldiers," concluded Mr. Home, "but&#xD;
here, sir, in this country you are so absorbed in money-&#xD;
making that you have no taste for such a manly and&#xD;
heatliful exercise."&#xD;
"Well, no," said Myndert, "itjs not exactly the taste&#xD;
that's wanting, but it would hardly be safe. For if any&#xD;
set of gentlemen took it into their heads to damage a&#xD;
farmer's crops in that way, it is more than likely that at&#xD;
a repetition of the amusement they would be arrested&#xD;
by a rifle-bullet lodged in one of them."&#xD;
"llumph," said Mr. Home, "perhaps so; there's no&#xD;
limit to the lawlessness of your settlers as fostered by&#xD;
your anarchical institutions."&#xD;
Such conversations often led into arguments which&#xD;
were conducted, on the side of Mi'. home, with a certain&#xD;
degree of warmth and suppressed irritability, yet the&#xD;
two invariably parted staunch friends, perhaps because&#xD;
Mr. Home became after each debate the more conscious&#xD;
of the pith of sense and pride of worth of his opponent,&#xD;
and having but a mean opinion of the mental acquire-&#xD;
ments of the sons of our wealthiest fati~ilies, he was the~&#xD;
&#xD;
more pleased with the knowledge and vigorous intellect&#xD;
of the unpretentious ship-wright.&#xD;
* "Your brother, sir," said Mr. fiome to me, "is a man&#xD;
of great abilities. Were he in Great Britain, sir, he&#xD;
would without doubt attain a distinguished position.&#xD;
But, sir, what opportunity is there here for an honest&#xD;
man, however talented, when only the brawling dema-&#xD;
gogue and political trickster can succeed? Aye, sir, it&#xD;
is a great misfortune he is not a Scotobman or an Eng-&#xD;
lishman. Look at the Napiers, sir, or Lord Brougham&#xD;
-the greatest statesman probably of this or any other&#xD;
age-rose from nothing, absolutely nothing. And I&#xD;
'could point to scores of similar instances in the history&#xD;
of my country. lie possesses too, what I have observed&#xD;
to be totally wanting among American youths, even&#xD;
among those belonging to what you. call your best&#xD;
families, and that is force of chctrctcter. Your brother,&#xD;
sir, is an exception. But look 'for an instant at the&#xD;
young men who visit this house. What can they say-&#xD;
what can they do? Some ask me invariably: 'How's&#xD;
business, Mr. Home?' or if a steamer arrive I am&#xD;
informed, not that there is a change of ministry or that&#xD;
such a horse has won the Derby, but I am told that&#xD;
'cotton's up,' or 'flour's down,' as if I didn't hear&#xD;
enough about cotton and all that at the countin~-room,&#xD;
and as if one couldn't sink the shop for a few moments&#xD;
and talk of something else. And those who are not&#xD;
engaged in mercantile pursuits, know even less and can&#xD;
only talk about the pattern of their waistcoats, or the cut&#xD;
of their trowsers. Take young Goldistone for instance,&#xD;
who I am told belongs to one of y~iur 'oldest families,'&#xD;
in fact, can trace his ancestry as far back as his great-&#xD;

cabbage garden somewhere about Wall street, ha-ha ~&#xD;
I say, take young Goldistone who has received some&#xD;
sort of degree from some college, well, sir, when I&#xD;
imparted to him the other day the news that Her&#xD;
Majesty had prorogued parliament, he actually asked me&#xD;
what that was! and when I tried him on literature, and&#xD;
asked him i1f he admired Kit North as a writer, he&#xD;
replied~t~tAe had never heard of him! indeed he only -&#xD;
found his tongue when he began talking some nonsense&#xD;
to Lesbia about the trinkets on her chatelaine. Put such&#xD;
an effeminate fellow as that astride a mettlesome hunter~&#xD;
before a five-barred gate, or let him pull stroke oar in a&#xD;
five-mile race, and what kind of a show would he make?&#xD;
Indeed I find that among you here, all the stamina of&#xD;
the nation, and all the physical manhood is confined to&#xD;
the lower classes, while with us it is quite the reverse.&#xD;
Why, sir, my elder brother Cuthbert Home, when a&#xD;
young man and in London, was coming out of the Finish&#xD;
one night with some friends when they were rudely&#xD;
jostled by a party of pugilists. A row of course&#xD;
ensued, and my brother was pitted against one who&#xD;
turned out to be none other than the renowned Men..&#xD;
doza. Cuthbert was an athletic fellow and an excellent&#xD;
boxer, and drawing off his coat he set to in good style.&#xD;
They sparred and fought for nearly an hour when the&#xD;
watch interfered; both, it is true, were severely pun-&#xD;
ished, but Mendoza candidly admitted that he had&#xD;
never met in all his career with a neater or more effec-&#xD;
tive hitter than my brother Cuthbert. What do you&#xD;
say to that from a young fellow of fashion? how many&#xD;
of youi~ young dandies could withstand such a bout?&#xD;
&#xD;
Yes, I think, you must certainly admit that there is a&#xD;
great lack of force of character among the young men&#xD;
of this country."&#xD;
I did not presume to deny it, but it struck me that&#xD;
strength of character, as he understood it, was due rather&#xD;
more to broad shoulders and well-developed biceps than&#xD;
to any faculty of mind or effort of will; from which it&#xD;
might also be inferred that Nyndert had ingratiated&#xD;
himself with Mr. Home, as much by his stalwart presence&#xD;
as by his good sense and well-stored mind.&#xD;
Mr. I-home, it should be understood, was utterly igno-&#xD;
rant of Myndert's love for his daughter, and had not the&#xD;
remotest idea that his attentions meant anything more&#xD;
than the common civilities of an acquaintance. Had he&#xD;
had the slightest suspicion of the true state of affairs, he&#xD;
would, immediately have interposed, for however much&#xD;
he preferred Myndert's society to that of the throng of&#xD;
vapid, glittering, pretentious, wealthy sparks who dan-&#xD;
gled in the train of ~he young beauty, yet marriage&#xD;
between her-the grand-daughter of Sir Allan Home&#xD;
and Lord Marshmallow-and an educated well-to-do&#xD;
artisan was entirely out of the range of possibilities.&#xD;
Blind and irrefiective, indeed, must that father have&#xD;
been, to imagine that any warm and free masculine&#xD;
heart could resist the many charms of his beautiful&#xD;
daughter; of that incomparable girl and masterpiece&#xD;
of Nature. Not but that Lesbia Home had other than&#xD;
~Aiy~ical attractions, for she also possessed those intel-&#xD;
lectual ones which consist in an intimate acquaintance&#xD;
with light literature, in the ability to classify flowers,&#xD;
sketch prettily, speak Spanish and some French, and in&#xD;
a tolerable knowledge of music. Not a piano-strummer&#xD;

&#xD;
was she, nor a shrieker of bravura, but a tasty, refined&#xD;
drawing-room musician, with a good contralto voice.&#xD;
We all thought her, too, exceedingly witty, but, as IL am&#xD;
now writing in cool blood and with an even pulse, we&#xD;
will say nothing about that.' At any rate, she certainly&#xD;
was sensible and sprightly; extremely fond of society&#xD;
and pleasure, and with such a magnet you will readily&#xD;
conceive that Mr. Home's house was much frequented by&#xD;
all the young men who were fortunate enough to obtain&#xD;
~n admittance, and that none who obtained that privilege&#xD;
ever escaped unscathed from the darts of the winged&#xD;
archer.&#xD;
And had Myndert attained any preference. over his&#xD;
numerous rivals? This was puzzling to decide. She'&#xD;
was always very amicable and gracious towards him,&#xD;
and seemed well pleased with his society, yet how could&#xD;
she possibly fancy so awkward and inelegant a man? IL&#xD;
could not believe that such a fellow as my grave, ungain-&#xD;
ly brother had found favor in those beautiful eyes. If&#xD;
it be so, thought IL, it is but another instance of the&#xD;
unaccountability and whimsicality of woman's taste.&#xD;
But ih sooth, at that time, Miss Home's heart was as&#xD;
impervious to the arrows of love as adamant, and pul-&#xD;
sated in that direction only with the joy of gratified&#xD;
vanity caused by new victims to her all-conquering&#xD;
charms.&#xD;
IL used Myndert to cultivate an acquaintance with the&#xD;
Homes, but after I had acquired a sufficient intimacy IL&#xD;
found his presence a great drawback to the pleasure of&#xD;
my visits. Another impediment and bore was Mr.&#xD;
home's fondness for whist. When present he would&#xD;
invariably insist that Myndert and I should join him and&#xD;
&#xD;
K&#xD;
it&#xD;
&#xD;
Mrs. Parking, the house-keeper, in a quiet rubber.&#xD;
"Leave Lesbia," he would say, "to entertain those&#xD;
jackanapes in the drawing-room. Myndert, you and I&#xD;
and your brother will have a little quiet enjoyment in&#xD;
the library." The library was very oozy, to be sure,&#xD;
with great cushioned arm-chairs, a blazing fire of bitu-&#xD;
minous coal, and our host'~ genuine Glenlivat or any other&#xD;
beverage you might choose-and Mr. Home kept not&#xD;
only an excellent ~vine-cellar but a ~vine-garret as well,&#xD;
stowing the precious juices alow and aloft to give them&#xD;
the temperature best -suited to their exotic healths-&#xD;
but for all these comforts, we went there reluctantly&#xD;
enough, and envied the jackanapes in 'the drawing-room.&#xD;
Ii; however, there were no jackanapes to entertain,&#xD;
Lesbian would take Mrs. Parking' hand, or Myndert's if&#xD;
he were absent, and then 0 pleasure! she perchance&#xD;
were my partner. Sometimes my boot wandering&#xD;
beneath the .table would touch the snug gaiter that&#xD;
enclosed her elegant foot, and once, but once, the gaiter&#xD;
returned the pressure, gently, but it was intentional, for&#xD;
IL perceived a flash of fun dance in her handsome eyes.&#xD;
It takes but little to please a vain or con eited ma~n, and&#xD;
this made me supremely happy for a month, and raised&#xD;
me to the seventh heaven of hope. I was in better humor&#xD;
with Myndert from that moment, and could well afford&#xD;
to pity him, the poor fellow, who was indulging in such&#xD;
absurd expectations; for in love, as in other matters, it&#xD;
is easy for a successful man to be generous to the unsuc-&#xD;

which Mr. Van Horn, with his old antipathy to having&#xD;
his street-door kept on the latch and his suspicions of all&#xD;
who were not in bed by ten o'clock, took umbrage and&#xD;
reproved me as ff1 were a school-boy. "And now, sir,"&#xD;
said he ia conclusion, "this has gone on too long andi~&#xD;
you do not choose to abide by the regulations of my&#xD;
household, the sooner you leave it, the better."&#xD;
1, in the most independent manner, took him at his&#xD;
word, and leaving the avuncular roof applied for lodg-&#xD;
ings at Dr. Rose's boarding-house. The Doctor intro-&#xD;
duced me to his landlady, a Mrs. Delaney, an Irish&#xD;
widow, whose chief aim in existing was to convince an&#xD;
incredulous world that she was an Englishwoman, and a&#xD;
vastly genteel one at that. Buxom was the dame, and&#xD;
most radiant in silks of many colors, with a small cap of&#xD;
lace, bugh~s, and ribbons on the back of her dignified&#xD;
head, and a big brooch enclosing a cameo likeness of&#xD;
the defunct Delaney (who must have borne a wonderful&#xD;
resemblance to RegiUns), shining like a shield on her&#xD;
bosom's-.&#xD;
superb abundance&#xD;
Where a man .rnay base his head,"&#xD;
as Mr. Browning sings.&#xD;
"It's me custom always to require the bist of rifferince&#xD;
from applicants, but in youi~ case, sir, I shall not dimand&#xD;
it. Your being introjuiced be Doctor Rose, our mutual&#xD;
frind, being all that's necessary in your favor and in me&#xD;
confidence."&#xD;
I bowed at this favorable~estimate of me, and,~ she con-&#xD;
tinued with much majesty; "I'm iot at all compelled&#xD;
nor yet have I the layste necessity for takin' borders&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
for heavens be thanked, Mr. Delaney, that's me late hus~&#xD;
band that was, he lift me whin he died a competency,&#xD;
but I'm so excadeingly fond of society, of gintale&#xD;
.~ociety, and not having any relations in this country, I&#xD;
cool less lonesome and less beraved with gintale society&#xD;
about me. I'm. constantly obleeged to use me bist&#xD;
indivors to kape me position and me occupation sacrit&#xD;
from me family in England, as well as Mr. Delaney me&#xD;
late husband's family in England, for they're all people&#xD;
of sich distinction and sich gintality and sich bike aris-&#xD;
tocracy, that the very ijeer that I was kapin' borders for&#xD;
the sake of society, wud be so shocking to thim all that I&#xD;
wudu't inform any of thim of it for the world."&#xD;
I soon discovered that Mrs. Delaney's gentility con-&#xD;
sisted mostly in jingling the keys of a piano in the last&#xD;
stages of discordance, in screeching out sentimental&#xD;
ballads, and in relating unauthentic anecdotes ~md remi-&#xD;
niscences of the grand folks and the grand society she&#xD;
used to frequent in England. The same proclivity&#xD;
towards gentility was apparent at table, where the ser-&#xD;
vice was majestic, the colored waiter ~in white cotton&#xD;
gloves, and much parade about the courses, the finger&#xD;
bowls, etc., but the fare was meagre and ill-cooked, so I&#xD;
followed the Doctor's plan and took my meals as often as&#xD;
possible at a restaurant~. The domestics, by the bye, wore&#xD;
all colored people. For, as Mrs. Delaney said, "Servants&#xD;
are sich plagues, but worse than all are thim dirty Irish,&#xD;
which I rilly ebominate. You should see the tidy maids&#xD;
we have in England, they're so nate and so gintale-&#xD;
looking. It's ruby a pleasure to have them about one.&#xD;
But thim Irish !--.thim horrid Papists! don't mention&#xD;

&#xD;
Mrs. Delaney evidently looked upon the Doctor with&#xD;
kind and favoring glances. "He's so gentlemanly and so&#xD;
gintale," she told me. "I-Low illigantly he sings Moore's&#xD;
melodies. Did you iver hear him sing, 'Ah, b'iave me&#xD;
if all thini endaring young charms?' It's delightful.&#xD;
His whiskers, too, remind me so of Captain Molloy's&#xD;
whiskers,. Captain Molloy married Mr. Delaney me&#xD;
late husband's youngest sister Miss Mary, and he died in&#xD;
the 1st Ingers (East Indies~, and his figure is so exactly&#xD;
like Lord Gerald Galloway, whose country sate is just&#xD;
beyant Mr. Delaney's uncle's country sate. And if there&#xD;
is anything I do admire in a man it's a gintale figure."&#xD;
The object of the widow's admiration was well aware&#xD;
of it, and alive to the advantages of his position. He&#xD;
found it profitable to foster her fancy, and in conse-&#xD;
quence the boarders were constantly regaled with alter..&#xD;
nate doses of the widow's affection and her piano-playing.&#xD;
It was either "Pompey Ducklegs," "'Twere vain to tell&#xD;
thee all I fe~l" (her favorite song), "Grand Java&#xD;
March," or her billing and cooing with the fascinating&#xD;
physician. What was it? Was it his whiskers, his&#xD;
figure, or his voice? Or had he some potent philter,&#xD;
some magical elixir? Perhaps so, fQr he was a skilful&#xD;
chemist. Oil of rhbdium will attract rats; pigeons, they&#xD;
say, fancy stockfish; horses, castor, etc., is there then&#xD;
possibly any essence, other than those distilled by Lubin,&#xD;
that will beguile the feminines? If so, Dr. Rose cer-&#xD;
tainly possessed it, else how account for his success&#xD;
where far handsomer fellows might have sighed in vain?&#xD;
I had been so much more comfortable at home, than&#xD;
I was at this boarding-house, that I rather regretted my&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
haste withUncle Garret, as I might hate effected a com-&#xD;
promise had I not ridden quite so high a horse. Xot&#xD;
that I dreaded his resentment or feared having offended&#xD;
him, for I confidently believed that, in any event, he&#xD;
never would completely disinherit me, and when such&#xD;
an overladen tree fell some of the fruit could not fail&#xD;
to roll at my~ feet. Aunt Jane, who had taken my&#xD;
departure much to heart, offered her mediation, but she&#xD;
was now so feeble, vacillating, and nerveless, That her&#xD;
endeavors in my behalf only resulted in Mr. Van Horn's&#xD;
taking a more decided stand, and refusing, not only to&#xD;
recall me, but to hold any communication with me until&#xD;
he should receive decided proofs of my repentance and&#xD;
reformation. This I was not ready to comply with, not&#xD;
feeling particularly guilty or conscience-stricken, and so&#xD;
from that time forward, although I frequently visited&#xD;
Aunt Jane, my intercourse with Mr. Van Horn was of&#xD;
the briefest and most distant character.&#xD;
This rupture occurred at an unfortunate moment, for&#xD;
soon after I was thrown i~ore than ever on my aunt's&#xD;
bounty owing to the loss of the sinecure I held in the&#xD;
Gotham Trust and Banking Company. That institution,&#xD;
after a short career of usefulness (to its directors), came&#xD;
to air untimely end. Its bankruptcy fell on the unini-&#xD;
tiated public like a bursting shell in a ball-room, for but&#xD;
a month previous the shares were selling at a premium,&#xD;
and a dividend of five per cent. on the capital had been&#xD;
paid to the shareholders.&#xD;
Mr. Van Horn met with no loss from the failure, for&#xD;
months before, that astute capitalist had, after catechiz-&#xD;
lug Mr. Treasurer Pennefether concerning some traii-&#xD;
sactions of the company, concluded to withdraw his&#xD;

influence and, investments from it. The transactions&#xD;
which decided him. to take this step were not those of&#xD;
the Western lands which he had recommended, but&#xD;
certain. loans of a somewhat similar character made to&#xD;
other parties, on what he considered insufficient security.&#xD;
The truth was that he began to mistrust Mr. Mickle~&#xD;
thwaite, although until now he had accepted him as a man&#xD;
of integrity. True, Micklethwaite had bribed the legis-&#xD;
lators with Mr. Van Horn's knowledge and tacit sanc-&#xD;
tion; true, the counsellor had in his legal capacity&#xD;
certified in the most accommodating spirit to the value&#xD;
and validity of his patron's doubtful titles to the worth-&#xD;
less Western lands, yet for all, Mr. Van florn, with the&#xD;
visual dullness that usually attends selfish introspection,&#xD;
could see no moral divergence in those little arrange-&#xD;
ments, and was surprised, actually surprised, when he&#xD;
learnt~ that the lawyer had been repeatedly bought by&#xD;
others. "i'll wash my hands of the whole affair. I'll&#xD;
not rh~k my reputation or money with this concern any&#xD;
longer," was Mr. Van Horn's decision after several con-&#xD;
enlt~itions with the treasurer, and when the latter had&#xD;
demonstrated that the assets of the company being&#xD;
almost valueless the shares were consequently entirely so.&#xD;
Whereupon, with the sagacity that seldom deserted him,&#xD;
Mr. Van Horn proceeded quietly to rid himself of these&#xD;
worthless shares while they still commanded a bonus on&#xD;
the Stock II~change. The other directors, with the&#xD;
prescience that directs rats to leave a crumbling tene-&#xD;
ment, followed his example, and in. this way the ever&#xD;
generous public relieved these financiers by e~cchai~ging -&#xD;
gold for snudry ~scraps of prettily engraved paper. The&#xD;

some not. A widow, a retired merchant, orphans, a&#xD;
shrewd speculator, all shared alike. But mark the con-&#xD;
sistency of our wily deacon! Justly indignant, was he,&#xD;
at the lawyer's venality when that venality subserved&#xD;
not the Van Horn interests, and set Micklethwaite down&#xD;
as a corrupt man who would cheat on any advantageous&#xD;
occasion, while, in the very height of this choler at all&#xD;
knavery, we find him slily selling stock he knew to be&#xD;
worthless, in fact, uttering base coin to unsuspecting&#xD;
victims. Such are the common results of inability to&#xD;
discern large-sized .beams in our optics keen, while we&#xD;
can see with great distinctness, motes in others' eyes.&#xD;
Self-deception-always self-deception! Would that our&#xD;
looking-glasses could reflect our ethical appearance as&#xD;
faithfully as they do our physical; though unfortunately,&#xD;
even as in the latter instance vanity blinds us to our&#xD;
ugliness, would conceit in the former hide our moral&#xD;
imperfections. In fact, we are all as well satisfied with&#xD;
our consciences and our moral condition as we are with&#xD;
the color of our eyes, or the shape of our noses; neither&#xD;
may be absolutely perfect, yet, they are as good as our&#xD;
neighbor's at least, if not better. IDid we sedulously&#xD;
pursue the properest study of mankind, the study of&#xD;
ourselves, and learn to know our faults ~ well as we&#xD;
know the shortcomings of others, we would inevitably&#xD;
become less selfish, and consequently more virtuous and&#xD;
happy. But alas! how difficult a task it is for man, vain&#xD;
man, blinded by conceit, allured by temptation and indu-&#xD;
rated by egotism, to know himself!&#xD;

These hours were indeed hours in elysium, at least all&#xD;
those when I was alone with her. If Myndert were&#xD;
present, or worse still, any of that multitude of empty-&#xD;
pated fops, vain would-be wits, affected, wealthy'&#xD;
noodles, who came so oftefi to smirk, and grin, and pay*&#xD;
her silly compliments, I was in an altogether opposite&#xD;
state from one of elysium, for she would not only listen&#xD;
to their vapid nonsense, but neglect nw entirely and&#xD;
appear utterly innocent of my torment! There were&#xD;
between twenty and thirty gentlemen in the habit of&#xD;
calling, and who were more or less taken with her.&#xD;
Half of them I heartily detested, and five, at least, I&#xD;
could have slaughtered. One, indeed, was beneath&#xD;
hatred, and even contempt. That was Gansevoort&#xD;
Goldistone, a little, thin, sickly whifi'et of twenty, that&#xD;
Lesbian could easily have cuffed to pieces. He was heir&#xD;
to the largest estate in the city, and was continually&#xD;
bragging of the number of pretty girls that were going&#xD;
crazy after him, and telling us how his mamma had&#xD;
bidden him beware of them. The fatuous wretch&#xD;
believed, I think, that he could have had Miss Home by&#xD;
the mere casting of his handkerchief. She, however,&#xD;
made a butt of him, and said ~uoh malicious things to&#xD;
his face, that any one of sense would have been abashed&#xD;
and hurt; but luckily for him his thick numskull proved&#xD;
a buckler to all her satirical shafts. It was very&#xD;
annoying, though, that she should notice such a fool,&#xD;
or even admit him to her presence; and I could&#xD;
joyfully have brayed him beneath my boot-heel like&#xD;
an insect; but vanity was her weakness; she was&#xD;
insatiable of homage, and would have accepted atten-&#xD;
tions and flattery from any, from an idiot even, or&#xD;

J WAS a frequent visitor now at "The Maples." Apart&#xD;
from the attraetion4n-chief it was a very pleasant&#xD;
place to while away the summer afternoons. Behind&#xD;
the. house the lawn sloped to the river bank, on&#xD;
which breezy spot was a shady kiosk, commanding a&#xD;
beautiful view of the majestic Hudson and bosky Wee~&#xD;
hawken. Here Lesbia would often Sit to sew or read,&#xD;
in company perhaps with Myndert, who sat in devotion&#xD;
mute like the Laird of Dumbiedikes, or with me, whose&#xD;
admiration took a loquacious turn. Towards evening,&#xD;
Mr. home having finished his after-dinner nap would&#xD;
join us, and we would have cool bonny-clabber, pow-&#xD;
dered with cinnamon, or pines sliced and soaked in old&#xD;
South-side Madeira, or lesbian's favorite dainty vanilla&#xD;
ice-cream, a mould of which I often ordered from&#xD;
Thompson and Weller's, for her especial gratification.&#xD;

a tatterdemajjon, as the Duchess of Devonsiure did&#xD;
from a dustman.&#xD;
And how did I progress with my suit? But sk~wly.&#xD;
In truth it was impossible for me to discover whether&#xD;
Miss Home regarded me with more favor than my&#xD;
numerous rivals, although I flattered myself she secretly&#xD;
did. Why should not she? Without being actually&#xD;
an Adonis, I was not by any means destitute of manly&#xD;
beauty. At least, was I as good4ooking as any of her&#xD;
other admirers. The labor I had undergone as a sailor&#xD;
and a soldier had given me a well-knit, active, erect&#xD;
frame, and a healthy bronzed face. I was a dexterous&#xD;
and graceful dancer (thanks to my apprenticeship at the&#xD;
Chaunii~re), and could rein a horse and sit one, better&#xD;
than nine men out1 of ten, and t!mese, I knew, were great&#xD;
accomplishments in Miss Home's estimation. I was also&#xD;
well versed in light literature, or rather, I read up inde-&#xD;
fatigably since I had made her acquaintance, and as I&#xD;
dressed after Dr. Rose-~-and he was acknowledged&#xD;
an unexceptionable model in that respect-why, I&#xD;
fancy, that take it altogether, no more eligible young&#xD;
fellow visited "The Maples." And yet-and yet,.-.~..&#xD;
whenever I tried in earnest tones to approach the sub-&#xD;
ject uppermost in my thoughts, she repelled it with a&#xD;
mirthful banter that always disconcerted me, though I&#xD;
certainly was neither diffident nor timid. My praises,&#xD;
however, sh~ invariably accepted with avidity; in fact,&#xD;
I was but a devotee before a shrine, burning incense,&#xD;
and adoring an imperious idol. Yet I found pleasure&#xD;
even in this; pleasure in wearing her chains, and in the&#xD;
privilege of serving her.&#xD;

early canter is alWays delightful, and it was the more so&#xD;
froni the, pleasure, I had in holding Miss Home's fine&#xD;
foot for an instant in my hand. There were steps and a&#xD;
block to mount by, to be sure, but we preferred the&#xD;
courtly way. Then away we dashed, while the grass&#xD;
was yet dewy, and the air fragrant with the breath of&#xD;
morning. She was a good horsewoman, and looked&#xD;
gracefully natty in her dark well-cut habit, gauntlets,&#xD;
and whip. She was so splendid too, after the exercise,&#xD;
and well the witch knew it as she came in palpitating,&#xD;
and presenting so glorious a contrast of glossy dark&#xD;
hair, dazzling scarlet face, and snow-white teeth; and&#xD;
all so glowing, so rich, so velvety, and so brilliant, that&#xD;
it were worth a hard trot of a hundred leagues to&#xD;
behold the delectable sight!&#xD;
"0 Lesbian !" said I, one morning, enraptured; "y6u&#xD;
are so beautiful, so far surpassing all others, that I fairly&#xD;
worship you! Worship you as neveit yet divinity was&#xD;
worshipped-~Vith every throb of my heart, and every&#xD;
longing of my soul !"&#xD;
Her eyes sparkled, her bosom dilated with exuberant&#xD;
pleasure at my eager, earnest words; hut before I could&#xD;
follow this attack, up must come Mr. Home, puffing like&#xD;
an asthmatic grampus. "Bless my heart-I'xn corn-&#xD;
pletely out of breath-how you young ones do go it-&#xD;
one would think you were following the hounds." And&#xD;
further sparking, that morning, was out of the question.&#xD;
I did not lose my appetite, though, if I was in love, for&#xD;
the havoc I made with Mr. Home's English breakfasts,&#xD;
his mufl~ns and bloaters, grilled bacon and marmalade,&#xD;
including that abominable "breakfast tea," was an&#xD;
admonishment to dyspeptic individuals.&#xD;

Love, that gentle madness, analytically speaking, is&#xD;
an emotion that derives its zest from tl~e sudden alter-&#xD;
nation of pain and pleasure, it imposes on the lover.&#xD;
Anon the sighing swain is raised by a smile to the&#xD;
highest pinnacle of ecstasy, and as quickly is he precipi..&#xD;
tated by a frown to the deepest depths of despair. lie&#xD;
is either ice or lire, and the transition is constant, until,&#xD;
perhaps, the honeyed cup he is quaffing, like the craftily&#xD;
spiced draughts of the poisoner, leaves a corrodent.&#xD;
~ot that any such dire result befell me, thanks to my&#xD;
abundant stock of self-eGuceit, and sweet, unalloyedly&#xD;
sweet and blissful, were the moments when I sat at the&#xD;
feet of my goddess, and drank in the low clear melody&#xD;
of her voice. In the drawing-room, where the dropped&#xD;
curtains excluded the garish light, with Lesbia at the&#xD;
piano, and I, seated by the songstress, watching her&#xD;
gaysome and marvellous face. See her now! animated&#xD;
by the subtle power of music. Look at that well-&#xD;
defined, harmonious profile; there is nothing seraphic,&#xD;
nothing celestial about it, on the contrary the small&#xD;
smooth nose, the round red lips, and slight doulAo chin&#xD;
melting into a fall snowy throat, tell of the true daugh-&#xD;
ter of Eve, who loves this world and its pleasures with&#xD;
all the ardor of vigorous youth, yet, if it be of too&#xD;
earthly a type to please the, admirers of the saint-like,&#xD;
dove-eyed, diaphanous class of damsels it nevertheless&#xD;
outspeaks a tender loving heart; a heart thaf could&#xD;
prompt its possessor to visit the death-bed of a lowly&#xD;
sister, and succor a helpless infant. Happy, indeed, will&#xD;
he be on whom is centered such wealth of warm afi'ec-&#xD;
tions! Could I but be that one! Half my life would I&#xD;
gladly give for fame enough to win her admiration, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
etc. etCA A multitude of similar thoughts, of vain&#xD;
desires, and preposterous schemes would cross my mind&#xD;
in such moments as I sat listening, while she sang some&#xD;
old ballad that I had heard perhaps a thousand times&#xD;
befolie. But what freshness would her pure voice infuse&#xD;
into the stale, sapless strains! Occasionally, as a great&#xD;
favor, she would sing for me an aria of Bellini's or&#xD;
Rossini's, a thing she never did. in company. 'Her voice&#xD;
was powerful enough to have filled the auditorium of&#xD;
La Scala; but she had the rare sense, in a young lady,&#xD;
to subdue it to the dimensions of the draWing-room;&#xD;
and how deliciously sl~e rendered that unparalleled&#xD;
Uh~&amp;amp; voce ~O00 fa I"&#xD;
Hardly had she finished singing when grasping her&#xD;
hand between both of mine, I exclaimed with all the&#xD;
ardor of a light comedian-&#xD;
"Teach me half the gladness&#xD;
That thy brain must know,&#xD;
Such melodious madness&#xD;

lady that sings. Laura has heard it, I'll warrant, and&#xD;
many others, no doubt."&#xD;
"Miss Home, am I a fool ?" said I, quite nettled.&#xD;
She looked at me in such a quizzical way that we both&#xD;
began laughing, during which a loosened braid fell on&#xD;
her shoulder. Unable to resist the temptation I pressed&#xD;
*the tress to my eager lips. "You simpleton, see how'&#xD;
you've disarranged my hair," said she, rising from the&#xD;
piano~stool and going before a pier-glass. But I was&#xD;
not to be so easily baffled, and taking a seat beside her&#xD;
on the sofa, I artfully strove to lead the conversation&#xD;
into topics congenial to my feelings. It is easy enough&#xD;
to drift into a declaration when both parties are willing,&#xD;
but, when the lover is ardent and the merciless fair bent&#xD;
solely on amusing herself at her suitor's expense, the&#xD;
affair becomes a difficult and provoking task.&#xD;
I tried to enlist her confidence and solve a lingering&#xD;
doubt. "Tell me, Lesbia, do you love my bi'other ?"&#xD;
"Tell me, Master Garret, is not that question rather&#xD;
cool and pointed? Icicle-like ?"&#xD;
"No-.but tell me, Lesbia, do you ?"&#xD;
"Do I! Amideinented, pray ?"&#xD;
* "Then you do not love him ?"&#xD;
"Are you in earnest, kind questioner ?"&#xD;
"Earnest! never more so in my li&amp;amp;."&#xD;
"Dear me, this is becoming amusing. And so you&#xD;
really are in earnest ?"&#xD;
"Lesbia, answer me-won't you? Don't keep me in&#xD;
cruel suspense. Let me know, if I am pursuing a&#xD;
shadow ?"&#xD;
"There are several reasons, charming sir, why I&#xD;
should not gratify your inquisitiveness. For, should I&#xD;
&#xD;
answer your questions in the a4lirmative, it might occa-&#xD;
sion ill-feeling between you, which I would not have&#xD;
occur for the world, and again, did I deny a partiality for&#xD;
your estimable brother it might deprive me of a never-&#xD;
failing source of amusement."&#xD;
"Amusement! what amusement ?"&#xD;
"The amusement of observing the many little mani-&#xD;
festations of fraternal regard which you exhibit towards&#xD;
him in my presence. They are so diverting."&#xD;
"Miss Home, I pray you don't jest with me."&#xD;
"Mr. Van Horn, I'm not jesting, I assure you. You&#xD;
asked me certain questions which, to say the truth, are&#xD;
rather beyond the pale of the admitted curiosity of a&#xD;
friend, and I, with my usual good-nature, endeaVored to&#xD;
answer as well as I couV, and now, instead of being&#xD;
grateful and pleased, you assume an injured air. To&#xD;
oblige you further, I will confess with becoming bash-&#xD;
fulness that I-esteem your brother as a true gentleman,&#xD;
a little avaricious, perhaps, but for all a gentleman in&#xD;
every sense of the word. Did you know that last&#xD;
Christmas, Myndert bought me a beautiful diamond&#xD;
ring, but fat her, who was present, would not permit me&#xD;
to accept so valuable a gift. I don't think Myndert ~t&#xD;
all regretted substituting a dollar fan for the ring. Not&#xD;
that I think any the less of the present or of the donor,&#xD;
but unfortunately I can't find it possible to admire him.&#xD;
in the least. 1-Le always dresses in such exceeding bad&#xD;
taste and has no ear for music. Think of his falling&#xD;
asleep during the performance of Fidelio, Beethoven's&#xD;
Fidelio! father nodded off first and M~ndert followed&#xD;

their knuckles with my opera-glass. Wasn't it outra.&#xD;

goons? flat Mynd~ert's agood soul for all, even if he does&#xD;
dress odiously. He's a handsomer man than you, Master&#xD;
Garret, and not half so conceited, that you will certainly&#xD;
admit."&#xD;
"Then Lesbia,7t I exclaimed, "thank heaven! you do&#xD;
not love him !"&#xD;
Describing love scenes is much like describing the,&#xD;
~a~or of last year's strawberries, and though those pas-&#xD;
sages are as white stones on the rugged road of life, yet&#xD;
are they incomparably stupid to the unconcerned. There&#xD;
is such a ridiculous sameness about them; prince and&#xD;
peasant, wise and simple, all act alike beneath the spells&#xD;
of the divine passion. It is therefore consoling to&#xD;
reflect that, however absurd it may have been, Solomon,&#xD;
for instance, would have done precisely ~s I did under&#xD;
similar circumstances. Dropping on one knee in the&#xD;
time-honored attitude, I poured forth a lava-like flood&#xD;
of rapturous words and endearing titles; breathed vows&#xD;
of eternal constancy; asserted solemnly, and sacredly,&#xD;
and mendaciously, that she was the first and only one of&#xD;
her sex that I had ever loved or even admired; covered&#xD;
her hand and rings with kisses; implored her to be&#xD;
mine, and then, grown audacious, dared to encircle her&#xD;
elastic waist and press my lips to the dainty cheek.&#xD;
She yielded for a second, just one second of ecstasy,&#xD;
then rising abruptly from my clasp, exclaimed in a&#xD;
rather angry tone, "Mr. Van Horn, you are becoming&#xD;
insolent !"&#xD;
A silence of some minutes ensued. Lesbian at the&#xD;
window, and I feeling as if it would be a great relief and&#xD;
merited punishment to be rammed in a mortar and shot&#xD;
off for a bom1c~. Finally, in a feeble voice, I apologized&#xD;
&#xD;
hoped I hadn't offended-begged forgiveness, etc.&#xD;
etc., when Miss home, who had been suppressing a laugh&#xD;
at my contrite and piteous tone, suddenly, and to my sur-&#xD;
prise, turned towards me, and cordially extending her&#xD;
hand, bade me moderate my transports of admiration for&#xD;
the future and behave like a sane man. This, metaphor-&#xD;
ically speaking, cold water dashed over me served but&#xD;
to increase my flame, and I left, perhaps more violently&#xD;
in love with Miss home than ever.&#xD;
The reader will recollect that on my visit to Miss&#xD;
Ludlow in Connecticut, I recommended to her aunt,&#xD;
Mrs. Hobby, as the best method of dispelling her nieces&#xD;
absurd fancy for a conventual life, to engage the young&#xD;
lady to spend the following winter in New York. She&#xD;
did so, and Laura came to stay with her aunt, Mrs.&#xD;
Van Horn. So effective was the remedy I had sug-&#xD;
gested, that, crc she had been a month in the city, she&#xD;
had so far regained her taste for a worldly existence as&#xD;
to fall in love with a tenor at the Astor Place Opera&#xD;
House~ and furthermore, she had become so fascinated&#xD;
with the dr~unatic art as to announce confidentially to&#xD;
her friend Miss Home, her intention of turning actress.&#xD;
Indeed, she actually proceeded to take lessons from a&#xD;
la~if~r who professed to instruct aspirants to histrionic&#xD;
fame, and frightened poor Aunt Jane severely, who came&#xD;
inopportunely into h~r room, one day,~ when Laura,&#xD;
with her hair hanging down her back was ranting, and&#xD;
brandishing a pair of scissors in a very insane way.&#xD;
But she was so unmercifully quizzed by Lesbia Home&#xD;
and me about this new notion, and hurt herself so in&#xD;
practising "falls," that she finally relinquished it.&#xD;

Great was her delight, though, when the cards came&#xD;
inviting her to a masquerade ball at the Homes'. here&#xD;
was an opportunity to don one of those quaint and&#xD;
splendid habiliments inhibited by the sober and sombre&#xD;
decorum of the present day. But what costume should&#xD;
she choose? That important question perplexed her&#xD;
greatly for a fortnight, until she reduced her choice to&#xD;
Norma, or Pauline Desehappelles; between these two&#xD;
she wavered so, that she was at last obliged to defer to&#xD;
Dr. Rose's taste. He suggested a hooped-brocade,&#xD;
with powder and patch ~ Ia Pompadour, as most be..&#xD;
coming to her style of beaut~r. I was to appear as a&#xD;
marquis, the most suitable dress for a well-constructed&#xD;
young fNl~xv with a good leg and an easy carriage. All&#xD;
sorts of precautions had to be taken to keep the exact&#xD;
nature ~of the entertainment from Uncle Garret's know-&#xD;
ledge, who would otherwise have certainly prevented&#xD;
Laura from going, as he flrn~1y believed a masquerade&#xD;
to be something akin to a Tartarean revel. Of course,&#xD;
he never attended parties of any kind; but Mrs. Van&#xD;
Horn, aroused from her apathy by Laura's preparations,&#xD;
declared that nothing short of a serious contingency&#xD;
should proven( her attendance, as she had never wit-&#xD;
nessed anything of the kind.&#xD;

evening, I was much surprised to see Doctor Rose pre-&#xD;

having invited him to go, I could see very well that he&#xD;
felt conscious of having successfully over-reached m~ at&#xD;
last. I was so annoyed at this, that I hardly spoke one&#xD;
word during the ride from University Place to Bloom-&#xD;
ingdale.&#xD;
The idea of the masquerade originated with Lesbia,&#xD;
and Mr. Home, who never even dreamt of denying his&#xD;
darling daughter anything, or of opposing her wishes&#xD;
in any way, entered heartily into th9 project, the more&#xD;
so as he was always pleased at any opportunity to en-&#xD;
tertain his large circle of friends and acquaintances. So&#xD;
the usual preparations were made at "The Maples."&#xD;
The carpets of the drawing-rooms were taken up and&#xD;
the floors chalked, plain rout-seats replaced the cumber-&#xD;
some furniture, and nearly all the plants in the con-&#xD;
servatory underwent decapitation, much to Cluny the&#xD;
gardener's disgust, who, holding similar social views to&#xD;
my respected uncle, Mr. Van Horn, looked upon the&#xD;
forthcoming party as a sort of drag-net of old Clootie's,&#xD;
who would inevitably make a fine haul of souls on that&#xD;
evening; a reflection, it must be admitted, which was&#xD;
certainly some comfort to a non-participant.&#xD;
On our arrival we were received with the warm web&#xD;
come characteristic of the family, for if there was any-&#xD;
thing' Mr. Home prided himself on, it was his hospitality.&#xD;
"I'm so sorry, Mr. Home, that Mr. Van horn couldn't&#xD;
come," said Aunt Jane; "but you kno~i~ how lie is,&#xD;
Lesbian, dear, this is Doctor Rose that I solicited the&#xD;
invitation for. Doctoy Rose-MiSs home. Garry, I&#xD;
believe, you have seen before ;" and after the greetings&#xD;
and introduction we retired to put on our masks.&#xD;

The guests were mostly English and Scotch, even the&#xD;
clerks of Home, MeLeod &amp;amp; Co. being invited-a breach&#xD;
of etiquette, by the bye, unknown in our more refined&#xD;
American circle&amp;amp;-.-and a remarkably hearty, red-faced&#xD;
set of folks they all were. Rugged too, and unversed&#xD;
in the minute points of' social courtesy, and I doubt if&#xD;
Mr. Home would have filled his drawing-rooms with&#xD;
such in. his own country. But away from the fhther-&#xD;
land patriotism increases.&#xD;
There were Highianders enough among the characters&#xD;
to form a body-guard for Roderick Dhu. You could&#xD;
see representatives from almost all the clans, and the&#xD;
host himself appeared when all were assembled, in the&#xD;
picturesque garb of ancient Gaul, as a Duinh6-wassel, a&#xD;
stout, full-girthed one with kilt, cross-gartered hose,&#xD;
and blue.bonuet and eagle's feather crowning his sonsie&#xD;
red face. The long claymore, which his uncle Colonel&#xD;
Douglas Home had wielded at Corunna, hung by his&#xD;
side; but it rather impeded his walk and he soon put it&#xD;
away. He talked much "braid Scot," to Aunt Jane's&#xD;
great perplexity, and was marvellously spry in the dance,&#xD;
reeling it featly as young Lochinvar with aged dames in&#xD;
white curls, aiA sashes of the Stuart or Macgregor&#xD;
tartan.&#xD;
Miss Home, contrary to her father's desire to have&#xD;
her appear as Flora MacDonald, and wear a huge cairn-&#xD;
gorm brooch, was simply enrobed in a black domino.&#xD;
She flirted much with a Captain Macheath, a little con-&#xD;
sumptive crusader, and a cowled monk in sandal shoon&#xD;
whose curly whiskers and furtive eyes betrayed him.&#xD;
There was Gustavus Kemtop, Mr. Kemtop's second son,&#xD;

charms in an ugly silk cloak, who could mistake her?&#xD;
for what other maiden could match that chin and. throat,&#xD;
whose tint was the more dazzling in contrast with the&#xD;
black velvet leo.&#xD;
Slmdy Fraser, a red-haired gentleman, created much&#xD;
merriment as Bailie Nicol Jarvie, ~nd a tall lady in&#xD;
spectacles was very imposing as a Wattean shepherdess.&#xD;
Eugene Kemtop (Mr. Kerntop's third son) came as a&#xD;
bandit, and his sister Olivia, as the bandit's bride. Most&#xD;
noticeable and resplendent of all, however, was a Nour-&#xD;
* mahal, gorgeous in pearl and gold. This was Miss&#xD;
Cora Goldistone, sister to Gansevoort Goldistone the&#xD;
consumptive crusader, Another paladin, a tall robust&#xD;
fellow with bristling whiskers, and very uneasy in his&#xD;
armor of proof and his starched Byron collar, was&#xD;
Myndert Van Horn, whose brother, the marquis in&#xD;
maroon~velvet-having evidently made up his mind&#xD;
to be misanthropic that evening-stood apart with&#xD;
folded arms, watching the black domino and her group&#xD;
of dangers with a jaundiced eye.&#xD;
The lion of the evening was the Hon. Clarence hay,&#xD;
a cousin of Mr. Home's, and a scion of the noble house&#xD;
of Marshmallow. He was a tall, heavy, stolid, hand-&#xD;
some fellow, with moist red lips and a complexion like&#xD;
a milk-maid's. The lion wore neither fancy dress nor&#xD;
mask. lie looked about him. for a few moments with&#xD;

my boy," said Mr. Home, who was scurrying about&#xD;
with his loo in his hand. "Lesbia's been promising you&#xD;
to so many charming young ladies." But the lion was not&#xD;
to be seduced away by any possible attraction from his&#xD;
crystal beaker of champagne.&#xD;
The monk made all manner of fun of everybody,&#xD;
much to the black domino's delight who could not help&#xD;
laughing at his ill-natured remarks and malicious droll-&#xD;
ery. How he quizzed poor lean Miss Ken', the specta-&#xD;
cled shepherdess, and fat Mrs. Little the dowdy English-&#xD;
woman with her outrageous jewelry, and puny Goldis-&#xD;
tone, staggering under his helmet, and the sheepish clerks&#xD;
of Home, McLeod &amp;amp; Co., who hung about the doors&#xD;
and looked as if they had been merely invited to look&#xD;
on; and the awkward knight of St. John with the bris-&#xD;
tling whiskers, and perhaps, e~ren the maroon marquis, for&#xD;
the black domino east a mirthful glance at him, and bit&#xD;
her lip to suppress a smile when she saw lie had detected&#xD;
her. Our marquis flushed hot enough to scorch his&#xD;
mask, for there Was nothing he dreaded like ridicule;&#xD;
and shortly after, to increase his angei', up must come&#xD;
that shuffling, weak-kneed crusader to take with an&#xD;
easy, aggravating, impudent familiarity, the black domi..&#xD;
no's arm as the Company promenaded to the supper-&#xD;
room, and the band played, "March-march Ettrick and&#xD;
Teviotdale."&#xD;
Indignant marquis! he tried to smirk as he led in&#xD;
Miss Olivia Kemtop, but his blood was boiling and he&#xD;
could joyfully have spitted the monk and the crusader&#xD;
~ith his rapier. At supper, lie did nothing but fume and&#xD;

&#xD;
fret, for Miss Home was apparently so happy, and&#xD;
wanted so much attention from that little pest Ganse-&#xD;
voort Goldistone, and the little pest seemed so conceit-&#xD;
edly pleased at his good fortune, that wheu he reached&#xD;
across the marquis to demolish a nougat pyramid, that&#xD;
nobleman did, with malice pretense, drive his elbow into&#xD;
the crusader's right eye which caused him to drop some&#xD;
nougat into the spectacled shepherdess' lace lap. There&#xD;
was glowering on all sides, and much suppressed merri-&#xD;
ment in Miss Home's face, arid after supper, when the&#xD;
guests had all returned to the dancing-hall, the crusader&#xD;
received word that a gentleman was waiting outside to&#xD;
speak to him. Somewhat surprised, he obeyed the call,&#xD;
and there on the lawn, at a little distance from the&#xD;
house, he saw in the clear moonlight the enraged mar-&#xD;
quis standing eager for the fray.&#xD;
"Van-why Van-did you send for me? What'~ up,&#xD;
eh ?" inquired Goldistone.&#xD;
"What's up, isn't the question," said the marquis,&#xD;
fiercely. "1 want you to apologize instantly, sir, for the&#xD;
insult you offered to-to-Miss Kerr."&#xD;
"Why-what insult ?"&#xD;
"Don't jest with me, sir, oV I'll flog you within an&#xD;
inch of your life-you little monkey! How dare you&#xD;
throw that trash on a lady's dress without apologiz-&#xD;
ing?"&#xD;
"I didn't mean to~ Van, you hit me in the eye, you&#xD;
know, I couldn't help it."&#xD;
"Down on your knees, you beggar, down I" cried the&#xD;
marquis bra~ndishing his rapier savagely over poor Gold-&#xD;
istone's head who, white with fear, dropped instantly on&#xD;
his knees. Fortunately at this juncture, Mr. Home, who&#xD;

had been sutumoned by old Cluny, arrived in th~e to&#xD;
prevent further scandal. "Gent1emen-~gentIe~~11~&#xD;
what is the meaning of all this? Mr. Van Horn you are&#xD;
forgetting yourself. Come gentlemen, shake hands and&#xD;
go into the house."&#xD;
The marquis, brought to a sense of his ridiculous and&#xD;
disgracefiul position, took Goldistone's proffered hand&#xD;
and very much abashed slunk back into the house.&#xD;
The guests were now amusing themselves with&#xD;
tableaux. One end of the spacious drawing.room had&#xD;
been curtained off for the display, and Dr. Rose acted&#xD;
as stage-manager. There was a scene from the Arabian&#xD;
Nights with a fat gentleman as a bearded pasha, sitting&#xD;
cross-legged, smoking a narghil6, and fanned by Miss&#xD;
Goldistone the Nourmahal. The next was Miss Scott,&#xD;
as the White Lady of Avenel; after which came "The&#xD;
Confessional," with Laura as the fair penitent and Dr.&#xD;
Rose as the priest; and lastly, as the bouquet, the cur-&#xD;
tain rose on a beautiful picture entitled the "Dying&#xD;
Guerilla." This was very pretty and effective. On a&#xD;
couch lay the wounded man, his escop~ta falling from&#xD;
his feeble gra~p, while a girl put a cup to his lips and a&#xD;
friar standing by upheld a crucifix. True, the soldier,&#xD;
instead of being a stalwart man was personated by Gold-&#xD;
istone the small, but the friar was good, and nothing&#xD;
could possibly be more beautiful than the well-dressed&#xD;
and too high-bred looking Spanish peasant-girl, for it&#xD;
was Lesbia Home, in trim blue kirtle and clo~e-fitting&#xD;
basquina; in white silk stockings and tiny black satin&#xD;
slipj)ers, an attire which audaciously permitted the dis-&#xD;
play of much superb roundness of limb. How they all&#xD;
stared at this new phase of Miss Home's beauty! The&#xD;
&#xD;
GARRET VAN HORN&#xD;
&#xD;
gentlemen, tor their part, were so well pleased with this&#xD;
tableau that they could have stayed and admired it till&#xD;
morning. But the ruthless curtain fell, dancing was&#xD;
resumed, and whist-playing began. The uncomfortable&#xD;
Knight of St. JoIm was lugged off by Mr. Home to a&#xD;
card-table as a partner for Miss Helen Cameron, an&#xD;
elderly Gaelic maiden, and an undoubted descendant of&#xD;
the celebrated Lochiel. Now, the men were gayer&#xD;
and the ladies less haughty. One buckish youth, clerk&#xD;
of Home, McLeod &amp;amp; Co., bold with wine, adventured&#xD;
to ask his employer's daughter to dance, but was speedily&#xD;
brought to his senses by her cool, polished refusal. As&#xD;
the hours advanced, the dancing flagged, and the men&#xD;
slipped off one by one to the library, where there was&#xD;
much boisterous fun and a great consumption of hot-&#xD;
water, loaf-sugar, and smoky usquebaugh. And Mr.&#xD;
Home, who would have done anything to please his&#xD;
guests from dancing a strathspey to standing on his&#xD;
head, kept urging them all to drink, "lout man, you're&#xD;
na' fon yet," he would say to Geordie Grant or Jock&#xD;
Mackenzie, as ~if nothing short of their being "fon,"&#xD;
could make them comfortable. He was constantly send-&#xD;
ing his compliments and a tumbler of scalding toddy&#xD;
to some Mrs. Stirling or Mrs. Farquharson in the card-&#xD;
room, and bidding all beware of too much sugar as the&#xD;
intoxicating properties of the mixture lay entirely in&#xD;
that ingredient-a joke he repeated at least a score of&#xD;
times with infinite merriment to himself, He jeered&#xD;
unmercifully those degenerate sons of Scotia, who pre-&#xD;
ferred the sparkling Sillery to the barley bree, but the&#xD;
degenerates only laughed and said champagne was good&#xD;
enough for them, and drank as only Gaels and drouthy&#xD;

By this time our frigid Honorable had, through the&#xD;
genial influence of smoke and grape-juice, thawed, and&#xD;
become condescendingly confidential with th~ Knight&#xD;
qf St. John, and as they sat together they were fast&#xD;
getting as fou and unco' happy as Tam O'Shanter and&#xD;
Souter Johnny in the picture over the mantel-piece.&#xD;
The Honorable Clarence informed lVlyndert, in a&#xD;
hu~ky voice, that Yew York was a deuced low and slow&#xD;
place, but that London was quite the reverse, and he&#xD;
explained with much prolixity and iteration the diver-&#xD;
sions of chaffing cabbies, kicking over baked-tatur&#xD;
stands, and milling coal-heavers, wherein consisted in&#xD;
his opinion the superiority of the latter city. "Bigodd,&#xD;
sjr, therQ's no amusement nor society for a gentleman in&#xD;
the States. The other evening, sir, I dined at the con-&#xD;
s4ate and as we were returning home, sir, rather late,&#xD;
Buliwinkle and I, sir-you know Uullwinkle, of course,&#xD;
li~'~ old Shoddy's nephew-~--you know. We called him&#xD;
old Shoddy ever since he sold that 'bominable old&#xD;

Won7tf repeat it, l~ut there's a good story about Pad-.&#xD;
that's the way we always used to call Paddy, you know&#xD;
-there's a good story about him which I mean to&#xD;
tell you when we get a little leisure. Well, as I was&#xD;
sayi~ig, it was rather late when Bull and I, that's BuIl~&#xD;
winkle-.whe~ Bull and I-or rather Bull laid me two to&#xD;
one I couldigt knock the lamp off a post at thirty paces&#xD;
with a paving stone in three shies, 'Done,' said I. So I&#xD;
paced off the distance, you know, and then I looked for&#xD;
&#xD;
K'&#xD;
&#xD;
a stone, and then I let fly. First shot missed, and the&#xD;
stone went slap through a window blind. Next shot, I&#xD;
came within-well F should say, I came within-within&#xD;
two feet. Now, you see I had but one more shy so I&#xD;
took pre~~iouS good aim and I fired, and-bang! went&#xD;
the lamp into bits. By this time, you know, up came a&#xD;
bobby who made himself rather ridiculous, so that in&#xD;
s~lfrespect I was obliged to floor him. Then, you see,&#xD;
theb eggar rapped aWay with his bludgeon, until finally,&#xD;
three or four more bobbies came to the rescue. Now,&#xD;
says I, to II~u1lwinkle, says I "-~---&#xD;
"Come-come-gentlemen," said Mr. Home, break-&#xD;
ing in upon them, "this is egotistic. Join the ladies-&#xD;
join the ladies."&#xD;
"Stop a bit," said hay, gripping him by the arm and&#xD;
forcing him into a chair; ~ I was telling this gentleman&#xD;
here-Mr.-Mr. -; I was telling this gentleman a&#xD;
capital story about little Bullwinkle-you know Bull-&#xD;
winkle, well enough, eh?" and Mr. Home resigning&#xD;
himself with patient submission was forced to listen,&#xD;
while Hay recommended his tale introducing elaborate&#xD;
episodes about old Shoddy and Captain Paddy, with a&#xD;
verbosity that would fill three chapters to report.&#xD;
But where is the discontented marquis in maroon-&#xD;
velvet, whom the sagacious reader has doubtless recog-&#xD;
iiised as his very humble servant, Garret Van Horn?&#xD;
While the rest of the company are still in the height of&#xD;
enjoyment we shall find him in the hat-room preparing&#xD;
to leave. The fact was, that being in a perfect rage all&#xD;
that evening-I took the first opportunity to escape and&#xD;
return home. Several things had contributed to anger&#xD;
me. Doctor Rose's presence was one. Not that I was&#xD;

jealo~ts of him, for nobody in their senses could prefer&#xD;
him to me, I having greatly the advantage both in age&#xD;
and looks; but I did not relish the idea of his having&#xD;
made the acquaintance of the Homes, for he might&#xD;
become too constant a visitor at "The Maples" to&#xD;
please me. He had tried to quiz me, too, I was certain,&#xD;
and I never would forgive him for that~ I was indig..&#xD;
nant, also, at Aunt Jane; at Lesbia; at that detestable&#xD;
imp, Qoldistone; and lastly, at myself, partly for&#xD;
having engaged in a silly quarrel, and chiefly for having&#xD;
sacrificed a pair of handsome whiskers to appear in con-&#xD;
gruity with that tom-fool marquis' costume, In this&#xD;
savage mood, I determined not to wait for Laura and&#xD;
Aunt Jane, but to leave them to Doctor Rose's escort,&#xD;
and to walk home alone as the best means of allaying&#xD;
my excited feelings. It was a freezing night, and but-&#xD;
toning my overcoat tight and lighting a cigar I sallied&#xD;
forth. On I trudged, sucking fiercely at the roll of&#xD;
burning tobacco until, its~ soothing properties having&#xD;
somewhat abated my choler, I began to feel rather cool&#xD;
about my thinly-clad legs, and was glad to accept the&#xD;
invitation of a man in a buggy who stopped to offer me&#xD;
"a lift." He looked rather hard at my three.cornered hat&#xD;
and knee~breeches, but made no comments or inquiries.&#xD;
He was a good-looking, xvell dressed man, with fur&#xD;
collar to his coat, fur driving-gloves, and was smoking,&#xD;
like myself. I said~ as I was drawing the buffalo-robe&#xD;
over, my knees, that it was very cold.&#xD;
"Nothin' else," he replied, laconically.&#xD;
I tried again a few moments after to draw him into&#xD;
conversation, but with no better success. He was evi-&#xD;
dently a man of few words and little curiosity. So we&#xD;
&#xD;
4 4&#xD;
(&#xD;
&#xD;
both remained occupied with our own thoughts, which&#xD;
suited me about as well. I noticed my companion had&#xD;
a long scar on one cheek, and from his keen face, LDQW-&#xD;
jug appearance, and clever handling of his fast trotter,&#xD;
I came to tIle conclusion that he was one of the class&#xD;
denomhi~ted "sporting men."&#xD;
We soon came to the pavements and went down&#xD;
roadwaya* At the nearest crossing to my destination&#xD;
I descended from the waggon, arid thanked the driver&#xD;
for the accommodation he had afforded me.&#xD;
"All right. Take care of yourself," said he, in return.&#xD;
I replied that I should, by all means, endeavor to do so,&#xD;
and we parted.&#xD;
On arriving at my boarding-house I was rather sin'-&#xD;
prised to see the hall-lamp alight. When I turned the&#xD;
latch-key and entered, Mrs. Delaney came forward:&#xD;
"Oh," said she, with a simper, "I thought it was the&#xD;
Doether. And have ye had a pleasant evening, Mr.&#xD;
Van Horn? And how did ye enjye yourself? And wont&#xD;
ye walk into the parlor, plase? Do, I've something to&#xD;
say to ye."&#xD;
So I threw off my coat, pulled an armchair by the&#xD;
parlor grate, and prepared to listen to the landlady's&#xD;
revelations.&#xD;
She began by observing that her health was fast&#xD;
giving way, and that her household cares were wasting&#xD;
her to a shadow (which, certainly, no one to look at her&#xD;
would have suspected, as her weight was rather above&#xD;
than below 200 lbs~ avoirdupois). N~ot, she wished&#xD;
~me distinctly to understand, that there was the "laste"&#xD;
reason for her keeping boarders, but society, genteel&#xD;
society, was her "wakeness," etc. etc. She said she&#xD;

I pretended to be very sleepy, and saying I would think&#xD;
over it and give her an answer in the morning, went up&#xD;
to bed, leaving her in the parlor to await Doctor Rose's&#xD;
coming, and settle scores with him.&#xD;

had a curious pain just here (putting her fingers on her&#xD;
capacious die~t), "a kind o' goneness like," for which the&#xD;
doctors bad unanimously prescribed "~six drops o' sperrits&#xD;
o' camphor on a lump of loafsugai'," which had given her&#xD;
great relief; and which she could recommend in case I&#xD;
were similarly affected. I said I was obliged to her for&#xD;
the recipe, and would make a note of it in my memo~&#xD;
randum-book. Then she mentioned that she had always&#xD;
had great confidence in me, and always entertained the&#xD;
highest ~f respects for me, that I was a real gentleman,&#xD;
and had never "desaved" her, and so forth. And now,&#xD;
beginning to cry, she complained with bitter lament~&#xD;
tions, that the Doctor had trifled with her ~ffeetions,&#xD;
besides owing her three months' board, and ten shirts in&#xD;
the wash a week, which treatment of a lone widow, if it&#xD;
could come to Mr. Delaney's ears was enough to make&#xD;
his very bones rattle in his coffin. From her slippery&#xD;
utterance and maudlin way, I suspected that she had&#xD;
mistaken spirits of juniper for spirits of camphor on her&#xD;
loaI.suga~, a suspicion that became a certainty when I&#xD;
caught a whiff of her fragrant breath. "Whin I ask&#xD;
the doetber for money, he sings: 'I give thee all, I&#xD;
can uo more, thouglv poor the offering be, my heart and&#xD;
Iut~e is all the store that I can bring to thee,2 which&#xD;
is illigant, but won't pay the butcher." I agreed&#xD;
with her in that view of the case, and she next rambled&#xD;
oft' into ~t long account of Mr. Deianey~s sister Mary,&#xD;
who married Captin' Molloy, who died in the kt Ingees;&#xD;
and as I reminded her, th~v I had heard of Captain&#xD;
Molloy's untimely death before, and deeply regretted&#xD;
it, she wound up by asking me for the loan of thirty&#xD;
dolI~r8 until the following week, for she had a grocer's&#xD;

shaving water not up in time, or the tender-loin of the&#xD;
steak not having been apportioned to his plate, to fly&#xD;
into a passion and threaten the landlady with an instant&#xD;
foreclosure of the mortgage. In this way,. Mrs. Delaney&#xD;
was subjected to constant unpleasant apprehensions, and&#xD;
being, as it were, under his skinny thumb, knew no&#xD;
better mode of conciliating the curmudgeon than to&#xD;
make love to him, a process which proved about as&#xD;
effectual as ogling a grizzly bear.&#xD;
So matters stood. Doctor Rose, with the natural&#xD;
aversion of a high.strung nature to meddle in monetary&#xD;
affairs, proffering his heart and lute as an equivalent for&#xD;
his board, lodging, and washing; and the landlady, in&#xD;
her turn, exercising her sweetest spells to mollify her&#xD;
crusty creditor. Now, this last one was not unwilling&#xD;
to be propitiated so long as everything went to his&#xD;
satisfaction, and all would have gone cn as merry as a&#xD;
dinner-bell (to use a new and appropriate simile), had it&#xD;
not been that there were others before whom Mrs.&#xD;
Delaney was powerless. These were grubbing, catch-&#xD;
penny tradesmen, who were not to be kept at bay by&#xD;
the blandishments of beauty, and insisted rather impo'.&#xD;
likely and obstinately on being paid in current funds,&#xD;
Mrs. Delaney consequently was obliged to retrench her&#xD;
purchases, and the scanty meals became still scantier.&#xD;
Liver and cod-fish cakes entirely supplanted steaks ~and&#xD;
chops; and haslet-stew, roast-beef. This caused much&#xD;
dissatisfaction among the boarders. Those, who 'paid&#xD;
let at once, and those that did not threatened to follow&#xD;
the others if' the table were not better provided. To&#xD;
increase her troubles, quarter-day was approaching;&#xD;
there was no money to pay rent, and the dreaded Slee-&#xD;

~JRs.DELA!o3~Y had come indeed to serious grief. And&#xD;
ill Mr. Sleeboy, the gentleman she had referred to in&#xD;
her conversation with me, was at the bottom of it all.&#xD;
Old Sleeboy, you must know, was one of the boarders;&#xD;
a middle-aged bachelor in the drug business who&#xD;
always carried about him an aroma of Spts. Am. Fort.&#xD;
and assafetida, which made him, by the bye, rather an&#xD;
undesirable neighbor at table. lie was one of the sharp&#xD;
and prudent sort, and had lent Mrs. Delaney the funds&#xD;
to furnish her establishment, receiving therefore, besides&#xD;
interest on the money advanced, his board and lodging,&#xD;
making in all a return of about sixty per centum per&#xD;
annum on his investment, the loan being secured by a&#xD;
mortgage on the widow's goods and chattels. This old&#xD;
bachelor was very irascible and apt on any shortcoming,&#xD;
such as his boots not being properly glossed, his&#xD;

was c~mnninieated to the unlucky widow on the evening&#xD;
I had gone to the masquerade, and was the cause of her&#xD;
unwanted perturbation and pathetic confiding in me&#xD;
when I returned. It certainly seemed now as if our&#xD;
genteel landlady had run the length of her tether, and&#xD;
a serious misfortunee were impending.&#xD;
It fell the next day.&#xD;
On descending. the nest morning I found Mrs. Dc.&#xD;
laney asleep on the stairs, face puffy and red, hair&#xD;
rumpIcd~ la~e~col1ar torn, and her brooch missing.&#xD;
Her interview with the Doctor had evidently come to a&#xD;
calamitous end, tbr he bore a bruise over the left eye&#xD;
which be confessed to inc had been inflicted by the&#xD;
widow's pelting him with the ornamental vases from the&#xD;
parlor.mantel; a fact, vouched for by the shivered&#xD;
mirrors ~iud fragikients of china'ware scattered over the&#xD;
carpet.&#xD;
By the time Mrs. Delaney awoke from slumber, the&#xD;
Doctor had packed his trunks and was preparing to&#xD;
leave the house, when she resumed hostilities. She&#xD;
accused him, among a multitude of offences, of having&#xD;
filched her jewelry., to which he replied, with cool&#xD;
scorn, by calling her a drunken trull and other epithets&#xD;
of similar elegance.&#xD;
Furious, with rage she flew at him like a tigress. The&#xD;
Doctor bolted into the dining-room to entrench himself&#xD;
behind the table. "Form a ring," cried I, anticipating&#xD;
some fun, to the boarders, who were coming in to break-&#xD;

&#xD;
DR. ROSE DOES TIlE AGREEABLE,&#xD;
S IIORThY after the masquerade, and when the w6und&#xD;
received in the encounter with the redoubtabl&amp;amp;&#xD;
widow Delaney had completely healed, Doctor Rose&#xD;
made Miss Home a party call. He expressed the great&#xD;
enjoyment he had received-was choice in his compli-&#xD;
ments on her appearance, and in short, made himself&#xD;
most agreeable and winning.&#xD;
"Your name's a Scotch one, I believe, Mr. Rose ?"&#xD;
inquired Mr. Home.&#xD;
"Yes, sir, my grandfather was a Scotchman, a Rose&#xD;
of Kilravock."&#xD;
"Indeed! A good family. I recollect well seeing&#xD;
their castle on the Nairn."&#xD;
"Any Scotch family's a good one. There's no villains&#xD;
or nobles there as in England. They've only heads of&#xD;
family. Any Campbell's a relative of the Duke of&#xD;
&#xD;
Argyll, but what affinity is there between the Percy and&#xD;
a humble worker in his mines? None whatever. Hence&#xD;
the poor Scot has more pride and self-respect than the&#xD;
humble Anglo-Saxon."&#xD;

"All through it-from John o' Groat's to Maidenkirk.&#xD;
Shot the red-grouse on the muir-..-the snowy ptarmigan&#xD;
on the blue Cheviots, and peered the dun deer among&#xD;
the Hieland glens. Your family, Mr. Home, is from&#xD;

"Aye, sir, a Border one."&#xD;
"I've a grand-aunt still living in Argylishire. Mag-&#xD;
nificent scenery there. I went once deer-stalking with&#xD;
a friend of mine, a fine fellow, Lord Craig, perhaPs you&#xD;
know him ?"&#xD;
"Not Hew Craig of the Cameronians ?"&#xD;
"The same,"&#xD;
"Bless me, you don't say so. Why Craig is a kins-&#xD;
man of ours. Let me think-Craig's mother was a&#xD;
Killicrankie of Fife, and the Killicrankies and Ramsays&#xD;
are our cousins, as yoi~ probably are aware. Know any&#xD;
of the Ramsays of Linkumdoddie ?" etc. etc. And Mr.&#xD;
Home narrated with some prolixity the various degrees&#xD;
of consanguinity between the Killicrankies, the Ramsays,&#xD;
and the ilomes.&#xD;
The Doctor listened attentively and made himself&#xD;
otherwise supple to his host's opinions. Then he begged&#xD;
Miss home to favor him with some music. "For the&#xD;
fame of your voice, Miss home, has reached me, and you&#xD;
cannot refuse to gratify me with a song. A Scotch&#xD;
ballad, if you will be so kind, for there is in these a&#xD;

melody so peculiarly local, so exquisitely sympathetic,&#xD;
that we cannot find their equals in the national songs of&#xD;
any other land."&#xD;
Miss Home com~died, and sang her father's favorite&#xD;
song~" John Anderson my Jo."&#xD;
Then of course the Doctor's vocalfame had reached&#xD;
Miss Home, and he must certainly favor them in his&#xD;
turn~ so he sat at the piano and gave them, "Of a' the&#xD;
airts the wind eau blaw."~~b~.He could not have selected&#xD;
any t~ please Mr. Home letter, who exclaimed 'in&#xD;
delight: "0 that's very fine indeed, very fine Mr. Rose.&#xD;
A little more if you please. You pronounce the accents&#xD;
of Auld Sc~ti; admirably~ I should without any hesi-&#xD;
tation have taken you for a genuine Soot."&#xD;
The obliging Doctor sang, "Jessie the flower of&#xD;
Dumblane," "My Nannie 0," "The Lass o' ~owrie,"&#xD;
and many other verses highly complimentary to the&#xD;
heather, the braes, blue cen, and gowden locks; and&#xD;
finally wouad up with the "Laird o' Cockpen," in&#xD;
which lilting song Mt Home joined, keeping time with&#xD;
his foot with much relish. Then Lesbia and the Doctor&#xD;
sang some German duets, during which Mi'. Home fell&#xD;
asleep in his arm-chair, until the cessation of the music&#xD;
weakening him, he proposed cards. "Do you play whist,&#xD;
Mr. Rose ?"&#xD;
"Very fond of it."&#xD;
"Mrs. Parkins, madam, ~i1l you take a hand? Lesbia,&#xD;
my dear, ring the bell for hot water. I beg your pardon,&#xD;
Mr. Rose, but what may I offer you ?"&#xD;
"I've an idea, Mr. Home, that I can get here some of&#xD;
the fragrant nectar of the heather hills."&#xD;
"You drink toddy, then ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
The Poetor in response quoted:&#xD;
"Let husky Wheat the haughs adorn," etoi eto,&#xD;
And Mr. Home rejoined with:&#xD;
"When neebors auger at a plea," etc.&#xD;
for he knew ~Burns from cover to cover.&#xD;
"It's seldom we can get any whiskey comparable to&#xD;
this~ here. Its aroma, I think, is superior to cura9oa&#xD;
without the cloying sweetness of the cordial," said Dr.&#xD;
Rose, sniffing at his beal~er.&#xD;
"Aye, it has the genuine fragrance, sir, the true peat&#xD;
reek," said Mr. Home.&#xD;
"Dkl you ever taste any of our native distillations ?"&#xD;
"I never did."&#xD;
"A friend of mine presented me a short time ago&#xD;
with a demijohuof very fine and eld Bourbon whiskey.&#xD;
If you would be good. enough to accept it, I should be&#xD;
delighted to send you some."&#xD;
"Thank you, Mr. Rose, you're too kind, indeed," etc.&#xD;
etc., and thus they chatted and played whist. The&#xD;
Doctor had Leshia for partner and though he played&#xD;
well, yet he managed it so that his host should win.&#xD;
Nothing more was needed t6 establish the Doctor firmly&#xD;
in Mr. Home's esteem, and he left the house with a warm&#xD;
invitation to call again, of which he failed not to avail&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
I learnt all this when I made my call at "The Maples,"&#xD;
which I did with some humility, owing to my uncere-&#xD;
monious behavior at the masquerade.&#xD;

&#xD;
evening, Mr. Van Horn. I was much pleased to make&#xD;
his acquaintance. What a very agreeable and prepos-&#xD;
sessing gentleman he is, to be sure. More like an old-&#xD;
countryman than are most Americans, isn't he, Lesbia ?"&#xD;
said Mr. Home.&#xD;
"He has a fine voice," replied Lesbia.&#xD;
"How well he sang, 'Of a' the airts the wind can&#xD;
blaw.' I hadn't heard anything like it in a very, very long&#xD;
while. It is the more remarkable too, in an American,&#xD;
for as a general thing tl~iere are but few good voices&#xD;
among your countrymen. We spent a very delightful&#xD;
evening indeed. Lesbian and he sang together for more&#xD;
than an hour. He certainly seems a man of superior&#xD;
intellect and acquirements."&#xD;
Xo gratification to me in that news. Of course I&#xD;
scouted the idea that the Doctor could make any serious&#xD;
impression on Miss Home, nevertheless I was not pleased&#xD;
at the progress he was making towards an intimacy with&#xD;
her, and I did not relish the fact that he had acquired&#xD;
favor even in her father's eyes.&#xD;
I was not in love with Miss Home. Love means seW&#xD;
abnegation, awe-like respect, and a complete and un-&#xD;
bounded belief in the object's perfection. Myndert was&#xD;
in love. He was stone-blind and adder-deaf to any of&#xD;
her failings or imperfections, and inflexible in his faith&#xD;
that she was a very angel on earth. But I could per-&#xD;
ceive her faults, perhaps because they so nearly resem-&#xD;
bled mine. I knew that she was not altogether celestial,&#xD;
but as material as any of her sisters; that she dearly&#xD;
loved luxurious dress, dancing, music, exquisite savors;&#xD;
all the delights, in short, of ear, eye, and palate, and&#xD;
was reckless enough in her conduct, if it suited her&#xD;

purpose, to use even flat deception, but for all that, a&#xD;
kind, warm-hearted, generous girl. Yet, as I said, I was&#xD;
not in love. I was bewitched, that's the word, fairly&#xD;
bewitched by the damsel! Her beauty and accomplish-&#xD;
ments, her eyes, her figure, her voice, bewildered, entran-&#xD;
ced, fascinated, bedazzled, and held me beneath a spell.&#xD;
Xo better evidence, indeed, is needed of my lamentable&#xD;
condition, than tb~e fact that I was seduced into taking&#xD;
lessons in guitar-playing and vocal' music, in the sole&#xD;
intention of surprising my sweet enslaver, some.~moon-&#xD;
light night, by warbling beneath her lattice a serenade like&#xD;
a very Almaviva. What an incentive is the divine pas-&#xD;
siGn! For three months I perseveringly strummed and&#xD;
hummed until I could twang some sort of an accom-&#xD;
paniment to "Love's Ritornello." Then adapting a few&#xD;
verses of my own composing to that air and metre, I&#xD;
flattered myself that I had gotten up something very&#xD;
pretty and effective in the way of a melodious appeal to&#xD;
the sensibilities of a drowsy maiden.&#xD;
It was on a night in the merry month of May, when&#xD;
the lilac blooms were diffusing their fragrance on the&#xD;
circumambient atmosphere and everything else was in&#xD;
a similarly gratifying state, that I sallied forth a trouba-&#xD;
douring of my lady-love. I had on a large Spanish&#xD;
cloak and carried my instrument under my arm- The&#xD;
ground being damp and air chilly, I wore india-rubber&#xD;
goloshes over my boots (fancy a troubadour in go-&#xD;
loshes!) a muffler around my throat, and put jujube-&#xD;
paste in my mouth to keep the larynx in prime condition.&#xD;
In this way, I went along about eleven o'clock at night,&#xD;
thinking of the surprise I had prepared, and how mysti-&#xD;
t           fled Lesbia would be, and then how pleased, on disco~&#xD;

vering that I was the author of' sueh a gallant, courtly&#xD;
act, to say nothing of the singing and poetry. Iinfor0&#xD;
tunately, by the time I had got within a halfmile of Mr.&#xD;
Home's house, clouds gathered and it became very dark,&#xD;
Presently, drops of rain fell. I ran for shelter; and more&#xD;
by accident than anything else, managed to strike the&#xD;
palings of Mr. Home's garden. Following these, I&#xD;
touched a gate. N~o~v I was safe, and walking up the&#xD;
gravel path rested myself on a piazza settee. The&#xD;
household were doubtless all fast asleep, for not a glim..&#xD;
mer was perceptible nor a stir to be heard, but outside,&#xD;
the wind blew through the surrounding tree-tops with a&#xD;
rushing roar, and occasional blades of lightning revealed&#xD;
a pale, white landscape, through which the heavy shower&#xD;
came pattering down like shot.&#xD;
There was a singular pleasure in my position. Here&#xD;
was I at dead of night, keeping watch and ward, over&#xD;
Miss Home, and she lying asleep not fifteen yards from&#xD;
me. I was a knight holding vigil for his mistress, but&#xD;
with' this advantage over the steel-clad lover of old, I&#xD;
eould smoke. So lighting a roll of the brain-soothing,&#xD;
time-destroying leaf I sat for more than an hour indulg-&#xD;
ing in all manner of romantic and extravagant fancies,&#xD;
There was a wild delight, though, in these reveries, a&#xD;
delight difficult to describe, but I could have continued&#xD;
constructing air~.casvles till morning, had not the rain&#xD;
ceased, the. moon shone out again brightly and a chill&#xD;
seized me, when I became aware that my clothes Were&#xD;
soaked, goloshes gone, and feet wet. My watch said&#xD;
one o'clock AJL, and I felt a tickling sensation in my&#xD;
throat which presaged tracheal difficulties. However, I&#xD;
was not to be bafllad in that way, and retired to a kiosk&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
on the 'hack lawn to clear my voice, tune my guitar, and&#xD;
rehearse a little before warbling my impassioned lay.&#xD;
Screwing away at the pegs and tinkling, I began t~Aum&#xD;

"The deuce!" quoth I, "there goes the C string.&#xD;
Trying, this, for it is almost too short." But I mend it&#xD;
and begin again, IIem-tink-urn tang !-umm-kaw!&#xD;
but unfortunately I am getting as husky as a crow,&#xD;
"Gent-'-tle Les--bi----ah---Slum" haw !-No use. "Prac-&#xD;

the tonsils are swelling. But remembering Bruce and&#xD;
the spider, I try again fTwang-twang~. "If at first&#xD;

again." But hark! the watch-dog's deep-mouthed bay&#xD;
strikes on mine ear! A scamper-a scramble-a jump!&#xD;
.~.-and I am over a stone-fence into a neighboring&#xD;
garden. Not an instant too soon, either, for I hear the&#xD;
dash of the vigilant quadruped through the bushes and&#xD;
his unpleasant gro~vl of disappointment. Confound that&#xD;
Rover! I never thought of him, and it's lucky I escap-&#xD;
ed being nabbed like a thief'. Then I hear a window-&#xD;

-.-Lesbia----obdurate fair! you never knew how much I&#xD;
suffered and all for you-for you!&#xD;
A man's in a pitiable state indeed, when he takes to&#xD;
penning sonnets to his mistress' eye-brow, ~nd to think&#xD;
how I did churn my brains to indite stanzas to Miss&#xD;
Home! stanzas, which (worse symptom) I actually&#xD;
believed pretty and original! Xay, more, that I should&#xD;
conceive the idea of conveying these rhymes, written on&#xD;
perfumed pink-tinted paper, in the centre of a bouquet&#xD;
which cost me five dollars at the florist's! Why I&#xD;
bought her flowers of which she had plenty of as fine&#xD;
ones, and why I hid the billet among them when I had&#xD;
every opportunity of seeing her alone, I am not able to&#xD;
explain; except on the hypothesis that it was the roman-&#xD;
tic way and stage mode, a fact, of itself, sufficiently&#xD;
indicative of the condition I was reduced to.&#xD;
All this while that insidious Doctor Rose was striving&#xD;
in every way to ingratiate himself with the folks at&#xD;
".The Maples." Knowing Mr. Home's fondness for the&#xD;
flesh-pots, he followed up his present of old Bourbon&#xD;
with a basket of fine smelt which he said a friend had&#xD;
sent him from Boston (through the intermediacy of a&#xD;
fishmonger), and when he ~vent to Philadelphia he&#xD;
returned with, perhaps a brace of canvas-back ducks or&#xD;
some fat reed-birds, as a contribution, with his compli-&#xD;
ments, to Mr. home's larder. He also gave his cook a&#xD;
recipe for making gumbo soup, and so what with flatter-&#xD;
ing Mr. Home's palate, teaching him euchre, playing&#xD;
whet and drinking toddy with him; and what with&#xD;
&#xD;
281&#xD;
singing with Lesbia, and bringing her new music and&#xD;
books, he became such a favorite at "The Maples," that&#xD;
I was exceedingly discontented and even alarmed. This,&#xD;
at length, led to a quarrel between him and me which&#xD;
occurred at the close of a dinner-party we attended&#xD;
together at Mr. Home's. That gentleman had received&#xD;
by the steam-packet from Liverpool, a turbot and a&#xD;
saddle of Southdown mutton, and of course nothing was&#xD;
more natural or more consonant with his feelings, than&#xD;
while he eat thereof his~uiends should partake with him.&#xD;
Myndert, Dr. Rose, an~ If, were invited; also Mr. and&#xD;
Mrs. Farquharson and Miss Kerr, Mr. Gibson conTh&#xD;
dental clerk of home, McLeod &amp;amp; Co., with others of&#xD;
more consequence; for instance, the Hon. Clarence&#xD;
Tiny, George J3iddulph, Esq., ll.B.M.'s Consul; James&#xD;
Fenwick Ashhnrnham, Esq., F.R.S., I3XG.S., etc. etc. (a&#xD;
distinguished naturalist on a tour through the States),&#xD;
his daughter Miss Emily Ashburnham, and our old&#xD;
friend A. Kemtop, Esq., and Lady. The Kemtops&#xD;
were always invited to any entertainment at "The&#xD;
Maples," not on account of any~ specially attractive&#xD;
quality in Mr. Kemtop, for beyond the respect due to&#xD;
his wealth, I think Mr. Home held the pompous Amasa&#xD;
very cheap indeed, but chiefly because Mrs. Kemtop's&#xD;
mother was a Scotch lady and had been a school-mate&#xD;
of Mr. home's mother, which circumstance was almost&#xD;
sufficient in that gentleman's view to constitute a degree&#xD;
of kinship between the families. Besides, he knew Mr.&#xD;
Kemtop would be delighted to meet English fdlks and&#xD;
more particularly a "scio~" of that nobility whose mag-&#xD;
nificence caused him such constant and profound admi-&#xD;
ration, for Mr. Kemtop, during his tour in England, had&#xD;

been immensely impressed with the grandeur of all those&#xD;
vast estates, their halls and lodges,, parks, chases, huge&#xD;
oaks, etc., and moreover he had been told or had read&#xD;
in the newspapers (his two sources of information) that&#xD;
some of the noblemen actually enjoyed incomes of a&#xD;
pound a minute! Think of that! sixty pounds--three&#xD;
hundred dollars every hour of their blessed lives! Good-&#xD;
ness gracious! wasn't it enough to make any man go&#xD;
down on his very knees and worship such grandees, and&#xD;
didn't they deserve all the honor, and esteem, and vene-&#xD;
ration, and everything else the world could bestow?&#xD;
But why did the honorable Clarence take a seat. at&#xD;
table directly opposite our worthy Mr. Kemtop? It&#xD;
was unkind; it was cruel. For the proximity of the&#xD;
scion" so completely wilted his pomposity that he was&#xD;
reduced to abject snobbism, lie committed fifty blun-&#xD;
ders. He perspired; he scalded himself with hot soup,&#xD;
and let hi~ spoon fall on Mrs. Farquharson's lap; he eat&#xD;
fi~1I with his knife and choked himself with his food;&#xD;
he called the colored waiter "your lordship," and then&#xD;
with ~ rush of blood to the head that threatened his&#xD;
life (for he was a man of full habit) apologized to Hay&#xD;
for having applied his "illustrious title" to a "nigger,"&#xD;
whereupon his "lordship" burst into a horse-laugh, and&#xD;
asked to take wine with him. Mr. Kemtop, more con-&#xD;
fused than ever a~t being addressed by Hay, insisted on&#xD;
his "lordship's," as he persisted in styling him, drinking&#xD;
first. "After you my lord, is manners," said the courtly&#xD;
Kemtop, and the lion. Clarence was so amused, that he&#xD;
invited Mr. Kemtop, should he ever go to London, to&#xD;
visit him at his rooms in the Albany. Such generous&#xD;
eondeseens~on overwhelmed Mr. Kemtop, and he was&#xD;
&#xD;
happy for a week, and contemplated a plan to introduce&#xD;
the "distinguished foreigner" to the Mayor and Corn-&#xD;
mon Council and obtain for him the hospitalities of the&#xD;
city.&#xD;
The dinner was a substantial one in every respect. It&#xD;
was served on solid heavy mahogany, in large dishes,&#xD;
and the spoons and forks were old-fashioned ~ihrer ones&#xD;
marked with the Home crest, and so massive that it&#xD;
tired delicate wrists to use them long. The viands were&#xD;
~~ainly prepared, but there was a choice variety and an&#xD;
abundance. The Southdown mutton and turbot were,&#xD;
to be sure, rather in disvor, although everybody affect-&#xD;
ed to praise them and Mr. Home triumphantly exclaimed&#xD;
that there was no such meat in this country, but in return&#xD;
not a vestige was left of that delicious native fish the&#xD;
Spanish mackerel, nor of the fillet of Dutchess county&#xD;
beef smothered in mushrooms.&#xD;
Myndert had anticipated a treat in Mr. Ashburnham's&#xD;
conversion, but that man of science was far more&#xD;
inclined to talk of wines and dishes than of anything&#xD;
else, Myndert tried to draw him out by asking his&#xD;
opinion of the t~ountry and its institutions, but the&#xD;
naturalist seemed averse to touch on that topic, assert-&#xD;
ing curtly, that the only things he had found at all&#xD;
worthy of notice throughout the States were the Mam-&#xD;
moth Cave and Shrewsbury oysters. My brother's&#xD;
national vanity was a little piqued at this remark, and he&#xD;
might have entered into an ill-timed discussion, had not&#xD;
Mr. Home prevented it by commencing a dessert-story&#xD;
which he invariably related when the conversation&#xD;
turned in any way upon American matters. It was not&#xD;

"That reminds me," began Mr. Home, "that reminds&#xD;
me of my first and only visit to a watering-place in this&#xD;
country. You see, Lesbia hadn't come over yet, and I&#xD;
was living in bachelor style at the Globe. I had read&#xD;
such glowing accounts of the place in the papers and a&#xD;
friend urged me so strongly to accompany him, that I&#xD;
decided finally to go. The hotels are so comfortable,&#xD;
said my friend, such good beds and fine sea-breeze and&#xD;
all that, that you'll enjoy yourself. 'Besides,' added he,&#xD;
'we have such good society there, such a host of beauti-&#xD;
Luf and intellectual ladies '-and he laid great stress on&#xD;
this as being especially attractive to an old widower&#xD;
like me. So I ~vent, but when we got there the hotels&#xD;
were so crowded that they were unable to give me a room&#xD;
or a bed, but offered me part of a billiard table as the&#xD;
best they could do. Not relishing the idea of reposing&#xD;
on so hard a couch, I obtained as a great favor a little&#xD;
dark closet at the end of the bowling alley, where I was&#xD;
kept awake half the night by the knocking about of the&#xD;
balls and pins. The next day, my friend introduced me&#xD;
to some of the celebrated beauties, but the lovely belle&#xD;
Miss A. squinted, the dashing widow B. wore artificial&#xD;
bloom and curls, the graceful Miss C. stooped, and when I&#xD;
remarked to th~ witty and accomplished Miss D. that it&#xD;
was delightful weather, she smilingly answered, that 'it&#xD;
wasn't anything else,' and subsequently, in alluding to a&#xD;
young man who was very attentive to many young&#xD;
ladies, she observed that if her beau 'should flirt iii that&#xD;
way she would soon be after him with a sharp stick,'"&#xD;
and Mr. Home stopped to laugh until the tears came&#xD;
I~tQ his eyes. "Then I wanted to bathe, but I found&#xD;

I must not go on one side as the m~dertow might carry&#xD;
me off, and on the other side a shark had lately bitten&#xD;
off a gentleman's toe, so I was advised not to venture&#xD;
in beyond six inches depth of water. They promised&#xD;
me better lodgings the next night, and gave me a neat&#xD;
bed-r6om, but unfortunately there was a hop that even~&#xD;
ing, and a~ the hopping was carried on immediately&#xD;
above me, I fared no- better with the hoppers than I&#xD;
did with the bowlers. As for the meals, the least said&#xD;
about them, the better; so finding I could obtain neither&#xD;
rest, food, nor amusement at this watering-place, Ii took&#xD;
my portmanteau and departed at once, and that is the&#xD;
only time I left New York since I have been in the&#xD;
States."&#xD;
"There is certainly nothing to tem~one to travel&#xD;
here," said Mr. Ashburnham, "for wherever I have&#xD;
been, even in the largest and finest hotels, I have not&#xD;
met with a tithe of that comfort and attention one inva~&#xD;
riably finds in any of our little wayside inns.~~&#xD;
"Such an inn, for instance, as Irvixig describes," said&#xD;
Dr. Rose.&#xD;
"Irving-Irving "-said Mr. Ashburnham, "pray,&#xD;
isn't he the author of that pretty Indian tale, 'The Last&#xD;
of the Mohicans ?"'&#xD;
"No," said Myndert, "that is Cooper, our Walter&#xD;
Scott."&#xD;
"Aye," said Mr. Home with a smile, "but not eiact~&#xD;
ly our Sir Walter." (lie never omitted the handle to a&#xD;
man's name.)&#xD;
"That's a fine portrait of Burns you have, Mr.&#xD;

Elegy of his, where he speaks of mute inglorious&#xD;
Miltons, for a true poet could no more help singing than&#xD;
a lark, Burns is an example......he sang at the plough..&#xD;
taiL It is a pity he was such aslave to drink."&#xD;
"I preaume," said Miss Kerr, "that he contracted the&#xD;
unfortunate propensity while employed as a gauger.&#xD;
It ~s customary, is it not, Dr. Rose, for such people to&#xD;
taste every cask ?"&#xD;
"Quite an original suggestion, Miss Kerr, thank you.&#xD;
Really, I never thought of that. But as I was about to&#xD;
observe, Burns and Shakspeare, those twin suns, are the&#xD;
only two poets who are truly fresh and uncontaminated&#xD;
by imitatiou and classical learning; and moreover, the&#xD;
only two who can compare with the ancients even if they&#xD;
do not surpass them, and why? Simply because they&#xD;
drank not from the .springs of ~astaly but from their&#xD;
native rifls, and communed with nature i~ propria&#xD;
persona, not taking her at second..hand like college-bred&#xD;
bards, who look at water, earth, and trees, through the&#xD;
spectacles of VirgiL Look at the French poets, the&#xD;
greatest, Racine and Corneille, what spurious trash have&#xD;
they penned, what servile imitators are they of the&#xD;
Greeks; in fact, the only passable poet the French&#xD;
have, is a song-writer formed entirely like Burns of&#xD;
native luaterials. We Americans owe England and&#xD;
Scotland for Burns and Shakspeare. a debt we shall never&#xD;
be able to pay. To be sure, we Yankees are a smart&#xD;
people and have acquired a proud position, but to whout&#xD;
do we owe it? To England, and when I say England,&#xD;
&#xD;
GAIU~T VA~ HORN.             287~&#xD;
&#xD;
I include of course Scotland-the rose and the thistle&#xD;
on one stem, from whom we have received civilization,&#xD;
ideas, and principles ready made, and well made too;&#xD;
I am somex~hat of a cosmopolitan as you perceive, and&#xD;
not in the least trammelled by national prejudices."&#xD;
~" It is very gratifying, Doctor," said Mr. Home, "to&#xD;
meet a man of your stamp, willing to render justice to&#xD;
the old mother country, for it is too much the practice,&#xD;
as you have observed, among Americans, to forget what&#xD;
they owe us in this respect."&#xD;
The ladies now withdrew to the parlors, while the&#xD;
gentlemen remained at table to smoke and drink. Dr.&#xD;
Rose slipped away at the first opportunity to rejoin the&#xD;
ladies, and I quickly followed. I found him seated on a&#xD;
sofa, between Miss Home and Miss Ashburnham, relat.&#xD;
ing some diverting anecdote. Not to appear annoyed,&#xD;
I commenced chatting with Miss Kerr. In a few mo~&#xD;
ments Lesbia intefrupted us, and said, with a mischie-&#xD;
vous glance at me: "Miss Kerr, you are a lover of&#xD;
poetry, I believe, and I want to show you some verses.&#xD;
You were talking a while ago about Burns and origin..&#xD;
ality, and now, here is a sonnet, written to a friend of&#xD;
mine by a young poet as yet unknown to fame, which&#xD;
you shall pass judgment on. I should say he was either&#xD;
a lapidary or ajeweller's apprentice, for his sitniles are so&#xD;
characteristic. Thejady's eyes are compared to blazing&#xD;
diamonds~ her lips to glowing rubies, her teeth to orient&#xD;
pearls, her lingers to silver tipped with opals of a&#xD;
roseate hue. Isn't it novel, tasty, and consistent? I&#xD;
bogged a copy to show you-read."&#xD;
Miss Kerr, who affected to be a great critic in literary&#xD;
matters, read my ill-used stanzas with a knowing simper,&#xD;
&#xD;

and then passed the billet to the Doctor, who read it&#xD;
with~ a jeering chuckle.&#xD;
"There is a Loot too much in the second line, I&#xD;
believe," observed Miss Kerr with great acumen.&#xD;
"That's where our friend the jeweler put his foot in&#xD;
it," said the Doctor, glancing at me and laughing&#xD;
brutally at his wretched joke.&#xD;
I became scarlet with anger, while Lesbia was wicked~&#xD;
ly enjoying my confusion. Sorely tempted, was I, to&#xD;
turn the tables on the Doctor by divulging his squabble&#xD;
with Mrs. Delaney, but luckily I restrained myself to&#xD;
bide the time when I could settle scores with him in&#xD;
a preferable way. lie noticed the angry mood I was in,&#xD;
and after we had left the house and were walking to&#xD;
catch the omnibus, he drew my arm through his in an&#xD;
amicable way and tried to conciliate we. "Did you&#xD;
notice, Van, that little Ashburnham? She's a pretty&#xD;
thing, aint she? The little rosebud 'begins to know&#xD;
her powers, too . . . How she played her eyes at&#xD;
you during dinner, and how she pouted when Myndert&#xD;
began talking to her about red sandstone and the&#xD;
formation of the Palisades . . . . Old Ashburnham&#xD;

stones, don't he? . . . . That Kemtop's a true toady&#xD;

Hay spoke to him there was danger of apoplexy. . if&#xD;
I had had a lancet I'd certainly have breathed ~rvein for&#xD;
him; as. it was, I could hardly refrain from sticking my&#xD;
fork in his jugular! . . . . What a rabid old Scot old&#xD;
Home is! It's a wonder he didn't treat us to a haggis&#xD;
and a dessert of bannocks o' barley. How he affects&#xD;

&#xD;
Celt in1 him than there is in you, not a bit. He's such&#xD;
a bigoted Englishman, too. It's amusing to hear him&#xD;
talk about Burns-he pretends to hold him in such&#xD;
admiration, when, if the drunken gauger were alive, old&#xD;
home would see him hanged before he'd. have him over&#xD;
his threshold. However we can forgive a great deal of&#xD;
nonsense in the father of such a glorious daughter' as&#xD;
he's got, can't we Van? . . . That girl always reminds&#xD;
me of ilerrick's Julia with 'cheeks like cveam enclareted,&#xD;
double-chin, and rolling eye.' . . You've never read&#xD;
the hlesperides, eh, Van? No. Then you must . . . She&#xD;
looked splendid-trailseendant! that night of the mas~&#xD;
querade, don't you think so? What moulded elegance&#xD;
of leg and arm, how robust, and yet how shapely! just&#xD;
where the gastroenernius joins the .soleus. Were you&#xD;
an anatomist you'd appreciate those beauties better.&#xD;
Lord! what would Flaxman not have given for such a&#xD;
model. Begad, I don't wonder at her fancying mas~&#xD;
querades and short petticoats. She's excusable, certain~&#xD;
ly, possessing such charms, to wish to display as much&#xD;
of them as possible."&#xD;
In the temper I was in his free language soon fired&#xD;
me, and ere he had concluded talking, I cut him short&#xD;
with a blow in the face. He reeled back, and for an&#xD;
instant looked pale and aifrightened. "Why-why&#xD;
~-~-what the devil do you mean? Are you crazy or&#xD;
drunk?"&#xD;
"Dam you, I{ose~ if you're a man you'll strike back!&#xD;

"Go to the devil I" I replied, shaking him olE&#xD;
"Well," said he, trying to laugh, "the surest and&#xD;
quickest way to get there is to stick by you, so give me&#xD;
your arm. Yow, Van, when you come to your senses,&#xD;
my boy, you'll be sorry for acting so foolishly, You&#xD;
should recollect that I've been a good friend to you, and&#xD;
that you are under some little obligations to me. And&#xD;
besides, it isn't a very brave thing to attack a man&#xD;
who, you know, is prevented by certain forcible reasons&#xD;
from fighting. It's very much like striking a man when&#xD;
his hands are tied."&#xD;
I looked at him to see if he really thought I was&#xD;
fool enough to believe that any regard for Quaker prin-&#xD;
ciples or relatives restrained him from fighting, and he&#xD;
seemed so unruffled and sincere that I could have kicked&#xD;
him, but he had reminded me that I owed him money;&#xD;

IN WHICH UNCLE (~ARRET LEAVES ~&#xD;
R. Van Horn fell sick. A slight attack at first, it&#xD;
would have yielded to simple remedies, but "busi-&#xD;
ness-4usiness "-wag so pressing that he had not time&#xD;
to attend to anything else, and consequently, it progress~&#xD;
ed to a serious stage. Mrs. Van Horn, however, sounded&#xD;
the alarm, and sent for the physician, who insisted on&#xD;
the chase for dollars being suspended until damages&#xD;
could be repair~d. This was hard, to be sure, but there&#xD;
was no help for it, for though Mr. Van Horn felt quite&#xD;
certain of holding a clear title to mansionS in the skies,&#xD;
yet he was in no great hurry to occupy them, or more&#xD;
desirous* of leaving this wicked world than the guiltiest&#xD;
wretch in it. His illness increased. Old Doctor Jock-&#xD;
mell, the family physician, it was evident from his pro-&#xD;
found looks and his ~aying that every symptom was just&#xD;
as he expected, knew very little about the case, so he&#xD;

TARGET VAN HORN.&#xD;
&#xD;
called in his experienced friend Dr. Melijock to see what&#xD;
he thought of it. Dr. Melljo9k wore a helpless, abstract&#xD;
ed air, as if' his thoughts ~verein Tartary. Dr. Melijock&#xD;
felt the patient's pulse-.-400ked at his tongue-.....an~&#xD;
inquired, "Appetite ?"&#xD;
"Not the least in the world," replied Mrs. Van&#xD;
Horn.&#xD;
~ and Dr. Melljock made gestures as&#xD;
if Writing.&#xD;
"Paper ?" asked Mrs. Van Horn.&#xD;
"Yes," answered the doctor to the wall. OIl a slip&#xD;
of paper he scribbled some marks like Sanscrit charac~&#xD;
ters, and placed it on the mantel. Then grasping his&#xD;
hat he wandered foggily about the room in search of the&#xD;
door.&#xD;
"This way, doctor, if' you please,"&#xD;
" ~&#xD;
~ see," and Dr. lVfelljock&#xD;
disappeared. But in spite of Di'. Melijock's prescription&#xD;
Mr. Van Horn's malady went from bad to worse. It&#xD;
was aggravated too, by his forced restraint from busi-&#xD;
ness, and being unaccustomed to sickness he bore it&#xD;
with very little patience, Every evening Mr. Otter&#xD;
came to report Proceedings, hold consultations, and&#xD;
receive instructions. Yet this did not supply the wants&#xD;
nor allay the disturbance of that busy brain., I, also,&#xD;
occasionally visaed Mr. Van Horn, but he seemed to&#xD;
derive no gratification whatever from m~ presence,&#xD;
although I endeavored to make myself as serviceable as I&#xD;
possibly could. Aunt Jane, on her part, was unremit&#xD;
ting in her attendance at the bedside, and was spurred&#xD;
by the occasion into her bustling activity of former&#xD;
days.&#xD;
&#xD;

Weeks passed on, and there were as yet no signs of&#xD;
improvement in the patient. Failing to derive any&#xD;
benefit from the allopathic leeches he decided to try a&#xD;
honicoopathic one, but Dr. Sirnilia S. Curantur succeed-&#xD;
ed no better than the others. Then Dr. Jockmell was&#xD;
recalled, and a consultation determined on. Besides&#xD;
Drs. Jockmell and Melijock, came the eminent Galen&#xD;
Jeilmock, great in heroic surgery, having performed an&#xD;
operation that had even baffled Sir A. Cooper and&#xD;
Dupuytren* Thirty-six obstinate paupers, to be sure,&#xD;
had meanly perished rather than bear testimony to Sur-&#xD;
geon Jelimock's skill, but finally, one gratefully survived&#xD;
to prove to an admiring world the possibility of' the&#xD;
success of' such a difficult operation and to add lustre to&#xD;
Galen Jelimock's fame. Present also, was another&#xD;
famous practitioner, Dr. Mockjell, and our old friend&#xD;
Dr. Rose, as ~vise probably as any of the others, if he&#xD;
was a snake in the grass. The five physicians gathered&#xD;
around the bed of the sick man, whose languid eyes&#xD;
scanned their faces to read his fate. The leeches all&#xD;
looked supernaturally sagacious and solemn. Drs. Mell-&#xD;
jock and Mockjell cogitating on how stiff a fee they&#xD;
could charge so rich a patient, and Surgeon Jelimock&#xD;
feeling, perhaps, a little disappointed that the case&#xD;
afforded no opportunity to wield his bistoury and carve&#xD;
and extract a bit of living muscle. Next, they all&#xD;
retired to a private room. and old Dr. Jockinell related&#xD;
the history of the disease and the treatment he had pur-&#xD;
sued, whereupon the others unanimously declared that&#xD;
their experienced friend Dr. Jockmell had done all that&#xD;
could possibly be done under the circumstances to&#xD;
cure the patient. The great Jeilmock, however, sug-&#xD;

tested that it might be better perhaps to give the&#xD;
patient his next powder at half-past six, instead of seven&#xD;
o'clock. The others coincided at once in this valuable&#xD;
Opinion, but unfortunately at a quarter..past six the sick&#xD;
man expired, thereby depriving the Medico..chirui.gical&#xD;
Review, and the world, of the result of' that interesting&#xD;
experiment&#xD;
It~ takes a long time and much labor to build fame and&#xD;
fortune, but how quickly may one be snatched away from&#xD;
them by that grim, interme(~~~jflg scythesman Death!&#xD;
A man may flare away with ever so prodigious a flame&#xD;
in this world, but a breath suffices to snuff him out&#xD;
like the meanest rushlight of humanity. And Mr. Van&#xD;
Horn, who was a man of importance yesterday, vanished&#xD;
like a broken soap-bubble on the morrow and left no&#xD;
void.&#xD;
And now the funeral. A dark, gloomy room~a nar-&#xD;
row rosewood case-.-.the last bed of man, surrounded&#xD;
by crape~covered forms, a grief strickeji widow and&#xD;
sobbing sisters; a throng of mute, motionless friends;&#xD;
undertaker's men gliding noiselessly about and speaking&#xD;
with bated breath; and in a retired corner, a shy, shab-&#xD;
by old man in worn-out black gloves, poor IV~r. llogg, a&#xD;
true and sincere mourner~coine to pay the last tribute&#xD;
of respect to his dead employer.&#xD;
Did I feel any grief? Yo ;-how could I? There had&#xD;
been~ no affection between us. I Was moved at first by&#xD;
the disappearance for evermore of an old familiar face,&#xD;
but this emotion soon gave pl~ce to others, for had not&#xD;
the moment awaited for through many years at length&#xD;
arrived? And was I not now about to enter upon a&#xD;
&#xD;
G RET VA!~' flORN~&#xD;
long expected era of unbounded luxury and pleasure?&#xD;
To be truthful, it must be confessed, that, though I&#xD;
assumed a becomingly sad countenance while riding to&#xD;
the interment, yet was I all eagerness to learn the con-&#xD;
tents of the will. My heart was full of elation instead&#xD;
of sorrow, and I was chiefly occupied in forming plans&#xD;
for the enjoyment of my future wealth.&#xD;
The will was opened. It was a long, verbose docu-&#xD;
ment, but I listened with trembling anxiety to every&#xD;
word that fell from the reader's lips. There were a&#xD;
tedious list of bequests to various institutions; a small&#xD;
legacy to each of the deceased's sisters; and the remains&#xD;
der of his property was left to the widow. My name was&#xD;
not even mentioned. Judge of my amazement, despair&#xD;
-indignation! I took the will from the lawyer's hands&#xD;
and examined it carefully; I read it over, word after&#xD;
word, but found nothing different from what I had&#xD;
heard. I was completely ignored-completely cut off&#xD;
from any heritage-not one stiver left to me-nothing!&#xD;
I had bitten into the luscious-looking fruit-it was filled&#xD;
with ashes, and the mocking laugh of some malicious&#xD;
goblin seemed to ring in my ears!&#xD;
And this was the result of years of expectation; for&#xD;
this I had neglected every opportunity of earning for-&#xD;
tune and distinction; for this I had been lapped in soft-&#xD;
ness and pleasure, and left at last with an enervated&#xD;
mind, incapable of stemming the current of life, and fit&#xD;
but for a bubble on its surface!&#xD;
The public chroniclers said that the whole mercantile&#xD;
community were in mourning for the death of Mr. Van&#xD;
Horn, by which they meant that the flags on the ship-&#xD;

caused but little commotion in the world of traffic, for&#xD;
the world of traffic has no time for mourning or rejoicing,&#xD;
and its pursuits deaden the capacity for indulging in&#xD;
such elnotioiis his fellow merchants met each other as&#xD;
usual on 'Change, one would say; "So Van l'Jorn's&#xD;
dead, I hear-...hoiv much did he leave ?" Two millions,&#xD;
they say. "Sad affair-.J want to charter the Neptune&#xD;
for Cowes and a market," etc. etc. Another, more&#xD;
decorous, would mumble some trite reflections on the&#xD;
uncertainty of life, and add, "lie was a most worthy&#xD;
man, sir. I may ~ay a first class man, and made a~&#xD;
excellent note." And on they all continued, striving&#xD;
and struggling, and selling their souls for gold~&#xD;
gold-.--~gold! while one of their number, killed in the&#xD;
contest, was shovelled away from sight and memory for&#xD;
ever. Proletarians derived a little consolation from the&#xD;
event: "What good does his money do him now?&#xD;
he'd have been as well ofi wouldn't he, if he'd have&#xD;
given more to the poor? We're richer now than he&#xD;
is," etc. etc. Di'awing~i'ooms discussed the disposition&#xD;
Mrs. Van horn would make of her share of the property,&#xD;
said they; "There will be no restraint now to her love of&#xD;
display," and predicted she would wed again ere a twelve&#xD;
month was over. The praise of the dead merchant was&#xD;
spoken from a hundred pulpits, and his life held up as&#xD;
a pattern for the young and an example of righteousness5&#xD;
unto all men. The public prints blazoned forth his post-&#xD;
hutnous gifts to the cause of charity and religion, Here&#xD;

bituat~.&#xD;
It w~is our melancholy duty to announce to our readers, a short time&#xD;
ago, the demise of our old and much esteemed fellow citizen, Garret&#xD;
Van Horn, Esq. Mr. Van Horn was eminently a self-made man. He&#xD;
came to this city when a boy, and entered the counting-house of the&#xD;
late Abraham Depeyster, of whom in due course of time he became a&#xD;
partner and eventually the successor. He was thoroughly a mer-&#xD;
chant as well as a gentleman of the old-school. One of those mer-&#xD;
chants who ~tbide by the good old rules of prudence and 'economy,&#xD;
and abstain from rash adventures, and wild speculations. He was,&#xD;
moreover, distinguished as a man of the strictest principles of honor&#xD;
and the most unswerving integrity. But he is chiefly mourned and&#xD;
regretted for those Christian virtues which he evinced on every occa-&#xD;
sion. His ear and purse were always open to every tale of want and&#xD;
sorrow, and the necessitons never left him unsuccored. His large&#xD;
fortune was always at the disposal of any benevolent or religious&#xD;
institution, and the aggregate of money he gave in that direction, if&#xD;
published, would, hardly be credited. In fact, we are informed that&#xD;
the bequests to our various religious and charitable societies, men-&#xD;
tioned in his will, amount to no less than half-a-million dollars. Mr.&#xD;
Van Horn, we believe, never had any children, and we learn that his&#xD;
widow is named residuary legatee. In conclusion, we may state that&#xD;
he dicd, as he had lived, like a true Christian and in the full hope of a&#xD;
blessed Immortality. Truly may we say in this case, "that Angels&#xD;
weep when such men die."&#xD;
Whilst reading that article my soured feelings vibrat-&#xD;
ed between anger and contempt, and I exclaimed:&#xD;
What glozing of a hypocrite! J~ut now, in the calm-&#xD;
ness of disinterested retrospection, I retract that hasty&#xD;
verdict, for hypocrite my uncle certainly was not. llY~o-&#xD;
crites indeed, or dissemblers who knowingly counterfeit&#xD;
virtue, are almost as scarce as true Christians, arid Mr.&#xD;
XTan Horn believed to the end that he had always lived&#xD;

&#xD;
as man is commanded to live, and died in the certainty&#xD;
of a blessed Immortality; peacefully breathing his last&#xD;
as many a more erring man has done, and many more&#xD;
will do, for self-deception can give as quiet a death-bed&#xD;
as a life passed in the exercise of all the, Christian&#xD;
virtues.&#xD;
The late Mr. Van Horn was one of the many self.&#xD;
righteous and deluded men who strive tQ Serve the two&#xD;
masters, God and Mammon, lie had been pious,&#xD;
because piety is profitable, and had abstained from evil&#xD;
ways, for evil ways are costly and injurious. honesty&#xD;
is the best policy and not only honesty but virtue of&#xD;
every kind, was his motto, and a mean One itis. Ischew&#xD;
rioting&#xD;

early, be industrious and economical, keep your face&#xD;
clean and your boots polished, attend worship on Sun-&#xD;
days, and you will be a good man, respected by all,&#xD;
prosperous and blessed; for he agreed with Shylock,&#xD;
without even having read the play, that "thrift is&#xD;
h1essino~" But all this might not prevent one from&#xD;
becoming selfish. A wholesome selfishness, thought Mr.&#xD;
Van Horn, and one that kept people from drunkenness&#xD;
and kindred vices; bu~ who shall say that calculating&#xD;
virtue will find more favor than impulsive Vice? But&#xD;
again, as public report said, Mr. Van Horn was gene-&#xD;
rous and charitable, his ear and purse were always open&#xD;
to every tale of sorrow or want, so he devoted fi'om an&#xD;
annual income of sixty thousand dollars ten thousand or&#xD;
so to beneficence, another ten went to household eXl)efl~&#xD;
ses, leaving him a clear forty thousand to increase his&#xD;
store. Ten thousand dollars from sixty thousand to save&#xD;

Arithmetic is a stern science and destroys many a pretty&#xD;
illusion. however, when Mr. Van horn perceived that&#xD;
he was about to be snatched away from his treasures anc~1&#xD;
that he could no longer retain them, he sensibly laid an&#xD;
anchor to windward by leaving a large portion as a&#xD;
propitiatory offering, or rather as an admittance fee to&#xD;
the realms above.&#xD;
It has been said that every man has his price; whether&#xD;
this be true or not it is certain that Mr. Van Horn had&#xD;
his. lie was not systematically dishonest, but he was&#xD;
far from being a man of "unswerving integrity," and&#xD;
necessity would easily have driven him even to the com-&#xD;
mission of flat burglary. Therein he differed from his&#xD;
brother the godless, niggardly Jacob, who was con-&#xD;
structed honest in every fibre of his body; who under-&#xD;
stood not deception, and could not conceive how men&#xD;
could be rogues. Garret, on the contrary, had as little&#xD;
idea of what true honesty consisted in, although he&#xD;
pirated so much about it. To be sure, he could refrain&#xD;
from picking pockets or robbing tills, but of a rigid,&#xD;
punctilious, rectilinear, thorough, sensitive probity, he&#xD;
had no conception, for it was always policy and not&#xD;
inborn virtue that guided him. A cold temperament&#xD;
and dry heart made him a calculator; no act was ever per-&#xD;
formed nor word spoken by him, without its effect being&#xD;
duly poised beforehand. He was certainly open-handed&#xD;
and lavish ~enough in certain channels; his gifts to&#xD;
charity were munificent in one sense, but relatively con-&#xD;
sidered were not so, and there was a want of catholicity&#xD;
about them that betrayed their abnormal origin; for&#xD;

There was ~ spontaneity about his charity, but he doled&#xD;
it in regular installments, which he supposed effect-&#xD;

to his work-room, or to his church where the l)astor's&#xD;
exhortations rebounded on his ear-drums as unheeded&#xD;
as the passing wind. Religion, though, he believed,&#xD;
was an excellent thing, not so much for its teaching love&#xD;
to all mankind, but chiefly because it den unced luxury&#xD;
and vice, and inculcated temperance n morality, and&#xD;
industry, virtues that would infallible mak men pros-&#xD;
perous and respectable; happy he did not add, for it may&#xD;
be doubted if he knew the meaning of the word. Com-&#xD;

insensible to the world of beauty he lived in, as the&#xD;
caryatides in the temples of Egypt are to the wonders&#xD;
and marvels about them. Of the delights that music,&#xD;
poetry, and painting could confer, he had not the minu-&#xD;
test conception; in his opinion these were simply toys for&#xD;
foolish minds that would lead them gradually, into the&#xD;
degradation of the theatre and the dance. A peach&#xD;
lost half its savor on his palate, and could he have&#xD;
spared the time to visit Niagara, he would have admired&#xD;
it solely for its invaluable water-poxver. He measured&#xD;
all by~is standard; herein, however, he differed but little&#xD;
from other men, making no allowance for difference of&#xD;
temperament nor thinking that any could possess brains&#xD;
that craved other food than his, and that there ~vere&#xD;
imaginations so differently constituted from the shri-&#xD;
velled, torpid one in his cranium, that they could behold&#xD;
beauty and find sermons in stones or leaves. Fain would&#xD;

dilating on the excellences of the lamented man, allu-&#xD;

x" first act upon learning that I was entirely disin-&#xD;

mention that subsequent to Mrs. Delaney's downfall, I&#xD;
had been obliged, by the exigency of financial embaY-&#xD;
i'assments, to return to University Place.&#xD;
I was about ordering my effects to be removed-I&#xD;
hardly knew whither, when Mrs. Van I-Torn sent word&#xD;
that she wished to speak to me. 11cr bereavement had&#xD;
worn her to a shadow, and left her in a state of extreme&#xD;
nervous depression. My presence, though, seemed for a&#xD;
moment to revive her spirits, and she even strove, kind&#xD;
woman, to console me ror my disappointment. She tried&#xD;
many words of encouragement and ended with the&#xD;
following entreaty, "Stay with me, Garret, stay with&#xD;
me, and I'll make you rich and happy, yet !"&#xD;

I was in that sullen mood when we hug the idea of&#xD;
being ill-used, and are inclined to be angry with any~&#xD;
body's trying to relieve us of Our burden. "Madam,"&#xD;
said I, bitterly, "I can have no claim on you whatever&#xD;
My uncle disposed of his property jis saw fit. Whe..&#xD;
ther he did right in leading me int~h opes and anticipa..&#xD;
tions which he never intended to realize is another&#xD;
question, and I leave it to the world to judge whether I&#xD;
have been justly treated or not."&#xD;
To show roy fine Sense of the injustice done to me I&#xD;
was ready at that instant to enlist for a soldier or do&#xD;
any other silly thing, but, as Mrs. Van Horn began to&#xD;
show symptoms of crying, I relented and listened to her.&#xD;
"It is very unkind in you to speak so,. Garret. You&#xD;
know I have always acted like a mother towards you,&#xD;
and that there is no one in the world now that I think&#xD;
as much of as I do of you. At this moment, i feel the&#xD;
want of somebody to stay by me-...some one to live with&#xD;
me-.you Garry, that I have always looked upon as my&#xD;
son, you won't leave me now? Do not, Garry, and I&#xD;
will-..--.-." She was so weak and exhausted by vigils and&#xD;
her affliction, that Sobs interrupted her, and she was&#xD;
unable to say more. At the sight of her emotioii I&#xD;
descended from my pedestal of martyrdom and promised&#xD;
to remain with her.&#xD;
I now became absolute master of the house; received&#xD;
an abundance of money, and was treated in every&#xD;
respect like an indulged son and heir.&#xD;
Three months later, in the following spring, I went&#xD;
with ~anhope J(emtop and two or three other friend8&#xD;

never restored since I sheared them off for the masquer-&#xD;
ade at Mr. Home's. We put up at a tavern much&#xD;
frequented by sportsmen and enjoyed ourselves exceed-&#xD;
ingly, for about a week, in whipping the streams all day,&#xD;
and in playing brag and cracking bottles of ~vine nearly&#xD;
all night4&#xD;
Whilst there, I took up a New York newspaper one&#xD;
evening after supper, and my rambling eye fell on a&#xD;
paragraph announcing, of all things in the world, the&#xD;
marriage of Dr. Edmund Rose to Mrs. Jane Van Horn,&#xD;
my uncle's widow! Fancy my amazement and anger!&#xD;
I could hardly believe this news at first, but, on reflec-&#xD;
tion, a hundred little incidents unheeded before served to&#xD;
confirm the probability of it's being true. How blind&#xD;
was I, knowing so well the Doctor's false and scheming&#xD;
character and having observed his many insinuating&#xD;
ways in other directions, not to have discovered his&#xD;
insidious plans over my aunt, that I might have warned&#xD;
her in time and prevented this marriage, so fraught with&#xD;
misfortune to her and to me. Fool, fool-that I was!&#xD;
Duped, completely duped! I could have torn my hair&#xD;
for very rage! And how could Mrs. Van Horn have so&#xD;
deceived me? I was much attached to her, apart from&#xD;
any promptings of interest, and had never forgotten how&#xD;
invariably kind and generous she had been to me. But&#xD;
now, wedded to a man whom I detested, to an enemy of&#xD;
mine, all intercourse between us must cease, for I would&#xD;
scorn to be beholden to ~either her or her husband for&#xD;
the slightest favor.&#xD;
I returned to the city, went imrn~diately to University&#xD;

Place, and without seekingg Mrs. Van Horn, gave orders to&#xD;
Dennis to have my effects removed to a neighboring&#xD;
hotel. Dennis said his mistress desired to see me. I&#xD;
hesitated for an instant and then complied with her&#xD;
request. On mounting the stairs II Caine face to face with&#xD;
Dr. Rose; we both scowled and he followed me into his&#xD;
wife's apartment. She advanced to meet me, but check-&#xD;
ed herself on seeing Rose. I bowed very coldly to her,&#xD;
but before she could speak, Rose arrested her with a&#xD;
wave of his hand and offered me a chair with a mocking&#xD;
smirk. I declined, and remained standing while he&#xD;
spoke in a tone of affected ease that did not glaze his&#xD;
hatred. "You are probably acquainted by this time&#xD;
with the news of my Inarliage with Mrs. Van horn.&#xD;
Under this new condition of things you will at once&#xD;
perceive that, not having the slightest claim on either of&#xD;
us, you cannot expect your former position in this house-&#xD;
hold to continue, but, of course, there is no need of offer-&#xD;
ing any explanation to a person of your Sense. We&#xD;
shall, however, be happy to see you at any time you&#xD;
may do us the honor to visit us." lie paused, as much as&#xD;
to say, this ~vill end all intercourse between us. In the&#xD;
same ironical vein, I replied, "Thank you. You are&#xD;
very good. I shall certainly avail myself of your kind&#xD;
and cordial invitation. Madam, allow me to congratu&#xD;
late you on your fortunate union. I don't doubt it&#xD;
will result in lifelong felicity," and with that, I turned&#xD;
on my heel.&#xD;
"Garry! don't," cried Mrs. Van Horn; but If heeded&#xD;
her not, and shaking the dust from my shoes, hastened -&#xD;
away with an angry, swelling heart, and without a~hope&#xD;
for the future.&#xD;

&#xD;
The last prop had been knocked away, leaving me&#xD;
utterly cast down! The golden mirage, that lure of so&#xD;
many years, now vanished and I was helpless iii the&#xD;
Slough of Despond. I felt now, the irnpotenc~ result-&#xD;
ing from instability of character, and an aimless and de-&#xD;
pendent existence. Without a profession, without the&#xD;
knowledge or craft requisite to earn a livelihood~ what&#xD;
could I do? To whom turn in this extremity-to&#xD;
whom apply for assistance? To Myndert, ~vhom I had&#xD;
only sought when in need of money? I dared not, and&#xD;
yet how I yearned for his support and sympathy! And&#xD;
how would the Homes receive me in my present posi-&#xD;
tion? I lacked the courage to test their friendship, and&#xD;
venture Lesbia's condescending condolence. I took a&#xD;
dismal pleasure, however, in nightly prowling around&#xD;
the villa, moping like ~ lunatic, steering as well as I&#xD;
was able through the windows, and conjuring all kinds&#xD;
of fanciful scenes and adventures with Lesbia as the&#xD;
heroine, and I as the hero, an imagery soon dispelled by&#xD;
the bitter reality.&#xD;
On returning to my room after one of these insane&#xD;
rambles I found a note for me. It was from Myndert,&#xD;
asking me to come to him. I could hai~dly sleep that&#xD;
night so anxious was I to see my brother and unburthen&#xD;
my troubles to him.&#xD;
Early next morning I went to his office. He happened&#xD;
to be engaged at the moment I arrived, and so, to&#xD;
beguile the time until he should have leisure to attend&#xD;
to inc I strolled about the yard, watching the sturdy&#xD;
artisans at their labor and meditating on the difference&#xD;
between their lots and mine. Day after day, year after&#xD;
year, were these hard-handed men at work, earnest as&#xD;

beavers while I Was still dozing on ~ Wine or&#xD;
dainties seldom passed their lips; of amusement they&#xD;
had but little; and yet, they seemed as contented as I&#xD;
had ever been when enjoying ease and luxury, Was&#xD;
occupation indeed a substitute for pleasure? I caught&#xD;
some of the enthusiasm of toil. Surely next to working&#xD;
himself the healthiest employment for an idle man is to&#xD;
watch others work, and what can interest a thoughtful&#xD;
beholder like the building of a ship? A temple is but&#xD;
an elaborated shelter, while a vessel is seemingly a huge&#xD;
thing of life, meant to tussle with storms; a magniflce~~&#xD;

to a seventy4'our grows, as it were, from an egg. Thb&#xD;
egg, or embryo ship, is a miniattire model of one half of&#xD;

Hercules. The model or semi-hull is divided into ima~&#xD;
ginary lines and sections, which are then drafted on&#xD;
paper in three plans called the sheer, body, and half-&#xD;
breadth plan. From these the craft is "laid out," as it&#xD;
is technically called, or transferred from its reduced scale&#xD;
on paper to its inteiided size, on the floor of a long loft&#xD;
where the lines and~timbers are traced with chalks&#xD;
From these designs exact patterns are made of half-&#xD;
inch plank, and thus every stick in a ship has its&#xD;
"mould" as the pattern 'is called. These inoulds are&#xD;
given to the carpenters who proceed to the realization&#xD;
of the idea, as the statuary's apprentices chisel at the&#xD;
block to bring forth the lifelike statue hidden within the&#xD;
shapeless mass.&#xD;
The keel is laid: a massy vertebra consisting of&#xD;
several long, squared timbers connected by a neat joint&#xD;
called a scarf, and firmly riveted by copper bolts. Then&#xD;
at the forward end, the stem, flanked by the apron, is&#xD;
affixed with the cutwater springing gracefully out like&#xD;
a spandrel. Meanwhile, rough, black, seasoned logs of&#xD;
pink-hearted white oak, or of the ponderous live oak of&#xD;
the Florida everglades, have been converted, by axe,&#xD;
and adze, and plane, into smooth segments; into futtocks,&#xD;
transoms, and graceful fashion-pieces, which ~re now set&#xD;
into their appropriate positions. The midship frame is&#xD;
bolted to the keel, and one by one the immense ribs in&#xD;
varied and diminishing arches rise in view. It seems&#xD;
now like the Ileshless skeleton of some enormous&#xD;
stranded whale; but soon this naked frame is covered&#xD;
by stout planking, rendered pliable by steam so as to&#xD;
cling closely to each curvature, and pinned by coag and&#xD;
tree-nails, The scaffolding and shores now removed,&#xD;

imperceptibly into' the stern-post. For all her huge&#xD;
capacity and weight she appears to the eye, while&#xD;
reposing on the cradle, as trim as a canoe. At last, set&#xD;
free from earth, she slides in stately silence from the&#xD;
ways, dips a curtsey, and then reposes in fearless grace&#xD;
on the breast of the treacherous billows.&#xD;
And all this work is by no means filigree or watch-&#xD;

Said Myiidert: "I cannot altogether sympathize with&#xD;
you, Garry. in the first place, Uncle Garret never made&#xD;
the least pledge or gave you the least reason to believe&#xD;
that you would inherit any portion of his fortune. He&#xD;
was far too conscientious and prudent a man for that.&#xD;
He merely took charge of you, or rather his wife did,&#xD;
and he endeavored to train and protect, to encourage&#xD;
and to reward you, as you deserved. Above all lie&#xD;
wished that you should carve your own way and not&#xD;
rely entirely upon him, and you must acknowledge that&#xD;
you never in any way met his expectations. But unfor-&#xD;
tunately, all your belief and hopes, and all our father's&#xD;
belief were founded on Aunt Jane's promises and talk,&#xD;
and you should have known long ago how her, tongue&#xD;
runs on without any distinct idea of what she is saying,&#xD;
and that, though no man of sense would depend on dead&#xD;
men's shoes, it is far more absurd to live and rely on the&#xD;
cast-off slippers of such a vacillating, kind, foQhsh&#xD;
woman as our respected aunt. Now you see the result."&#xD;
"Scold away," said I despairingly: "you're sharp-&#xD;
sighted enough looking back, and it's easy enough to&#xD;
point out error when the evil's done."&#xD;
"To show you that I have long been of the same&#xD;
opinion," returned he, taking a folded paper from his&#xD;
strong-box, "read the date of this. You will find that&#xD;
it was drawn up before your uncle's, death. This will&#xD;
prove I never did believe you would inherit any of his&#xD;
money. I expected it would come to this, and I can't&#xD;
say I am at all sorry. This paper I give to you. Read&#xD;

I took the paper, opened and read it. It was a deed&#xD;
conveying to me the homestead at Communipaw! My&#xD;
heart leaped! What could I say to this evidence of&#xD;
fraternal affection?&#xD;
"0! Myndert-.Myndert !"&#xD;
"Stop, before you exhaust your gratitude, and listen.&#xD;
I do nothing more than carry out what would have been&#xD;
father's will, could he have foreseen the result of his&#xD;
expectations concerning you. It is no more than my&#xD;
K&#xD;
plain duty to restore that ivhich really belongs to you."&#xD;
"But, at any rate, Myndert, this is more than my&#xD;
share. I am not entitled to all this. Father could have&#xD;
left but little else."&#xD;
"I can tell you that, besides money in mortgages, there&#xD;
was more gold stowed away in old stockings than you&#xD;
have any idea of. Anyway, if I'm satisfied with the&#xD;
partition I suppose you can afford to be. Now, having&#xD;
paid my debt to you, I'll have you do as much by me.&#xD;
Look," and he opened a ledger, "there is your account,&#xD;
and the amount of what you owe me."&#xD;
I ~aw a long row of $5's, $lO's, and ~2O's, sums he&#xD;
had lent me at different periods beginning as far back as&#xD;
the time I was in Paris, and which amounted to over five&#xD;
hundred dollars. I was surprised at this, never having&#xD;
suspected he kept an account of these little loans.&#xD;
Though I had just received such a magnificent present&#xD;
from him, yet, I must own, my gratitude was somewhat&#xD;
diminished at this discovery of his excessive prudence.&#xD;
"Give me your note, Garry, for the total, say at six&#xD;
months adding the interest. I hope by that time you&#xD;
will be ready to pay it from earnings. Here are pens&#xD;
and paper. And now that we've settkd accounts, let me&#xD;

give you a little advice and try to take it to heart. You&#xD;
have been unfortunate enough to live on expectations,&#xD;
and you have felt the injury resulting from leaning on&#xD;
such a feeble staff. You are yet young, and have a good&#xD;
stock of experience to begin life anew with. Every-&#xD;
thing induces you to spend the remainder of your life in&#xD;
a wiser and more profitable way than you have spent&#xD;
your past years. I 'know it is exceedingly hard to&#xD;
change rooted habits, but you must wrench away from&#xD;
them with a will! Don't for Heaven's sake, Garry, be&#xD;
idle. Work-work, do anything or you'll surely stag..&#xD;
nate and rot. how I'd like to see you live like your&#xD;
father before you, at Communipaw, and raise cabbages,&#xD;
or even here, working alongside of that chap yonder&#xD;
swinging the broad-axe; anything, anything, but lazi-&#xD;
ness. I wish I could clench this advice in your fickle&#xD;
brain; nail in every word to the quick, so that you'd&#xD;
feel and mind them. hold on, Garry, if you love your&#xD;
brother-A'iold on to what I say longer than a day. If&#xD;
you don't you're lost, sure as death !"&#xD;
hold to his words a day! No; not an hour. That&#xD;
mad, whirling passion for Lesbia Home overruled every.&#xD;
thing. No thoughts, no aspirations, no schemes, discon-&#xD;
nected from her, This lucky throw of the dice affected&#xD;
me but little. I barely felt some twinges of conscience&#xD;
at my neglect of Myndei't, which were soon effi~ced by&#xD;
his exacting those paltry loans, but, t~o-~thrce-four&#xD;
pplse.beats, and I was the same Garret Van Horn; living&#xD;

were some fifty acres, and they brought over one thousand&#xD;
dollars the acre. This was, in fact, a fortune, and with&#xD;
it I purposed indulging in many pleasures hitherto&#xD;
beyond the length of my purse, or rather, solving the&#xD;
question of how speedily one can rid himself of sixty&#xD;
thousand dollars in hard cash.&#xD;
My first duty was to pay sundry debts, among them&#xD;
about $150 due Dr. Rose which included the $50 he&#xD;
had sent me while in Paris, enclosing the check to him&#xD;
m a very curt note. I felt gratified in being able to&#xD;
cancel this obligation to that insidious knave, and to&#xD;
show Mrs. Van Horn how easily I could dispense with&#xD;
any assistance. I also paid the note given to Myndert,&#xD;
and felt now entirely free and independent of the world.&#xD;
Perhaps, it may be said, Myndert was injudicious and&#xD;
unwise in putting me absolutely and unconditionally in&#xD;
possession of so much property, knowing, as he did, my&#xD;
spendthrift disposition. A worldly-wise person would&#xD;
not have done it. But my brother considered his act as&#xD;
simply one of restitution, which he had no right to clog&#xD;
or hedge with conditions. His mathematically just&#xD;
mind knew but one course to pursue, for it was justice&#xD;
and not generosity that prompted him. A fig for gene-&#xD;
rosity! Any rogue or fool can be generous, but it takes&#xD;
a wise and good man ~o be just.&#xD;
I went to "The Maples." It was my first visit there&#xD;
&#xD;
/&#xD;
&#xD;

Ii&#xD;
&#xD;
since Mrs. Van Horn's marriage. Mr. Home was&#xD;
cordial as usual, and reproached me for having stayed&#xD;
away so long. "Though," added he, "I don't doubt&#xD;
but you've far more attractive society elsewhere than our&#xD;
quiet household can finish. Some fair lady, mayhap.&#xD;
Aye, natural enough too. At your age I'd have for.~&#xD;
saken all friends for a pretty lass. Well, well, you're&#xD;
still in the age of inflammability, 'ware! and yet why&#xD;
should I warn you? You must fulfil the destiny of man&#xD;
and undergo the fate of your fathers."&#xD;
Blind old papa! It never entered his unsuspecting&#xD;
head that the enmeshing syren was his dear daughter I&#xD;
But the syren, I detected with regret, exhibited an&#xD;
altered state of feeling towards me, for though I accost-&#xD;
ed her with more than my usual warmth of expression,&#xD;
signifying the great joy it caused me to revisit her after&#xD;
my long absence (which I explained by some fib or&#xD;
other), she received it all with a nonchalance that I could&#xD;
only attribute to her belief in the great change in my&#xD;
worldly prospects occasioned by Mrs. Van I-Torn's mar-&#xD;
riage. AhI thought I, she holds me now but ~s a pen-&#xD;
i~i1ess dependent; the halo that surrounded the pre-&#xD;
sumptive heir and rendered him an acceptable suitor&#xD;
has vanished. Like other worldlings, she favors the&#xD;
lucky and frowns on the unfortunate. So nettled was I&#xD;
at this discovery, so wounded in my self-love, that I&#xD;
could fairly have given all my~new found wealth to&#xD;
cause her to become a supplant for my favor and&#xD;
regard. I mentally vowed she should repent having&#xD;
slighted me, and since she was of so mercenary a nature,&#xD;
I would astonish and bedazzle her with a display of&#xD;
splendor and wealth,&#xD;

I occupied a suite of rooms at Julien's, furnished luxw&#xD;
riously as a sultana's bower. I kept valet and groom;&#xD;
three vehicles and four horses at Willard Reed's. I&#xD;
gave a jockey ca~'te-61cpzche to buy me a pail' of trotters,&#xD;
fast ones of course. He did so, picking one up from&#xD;
before a plough in Maine, and the other somewhere in&#xD;
Vermont. ~ey Were both bays, with lustrous coats,&#xD;
small heads, little sharp ears, slim legs, and well-matched,&#xD;
differing only in one's having a white lozenge on the&#xD;
forehead. I dare not say what they cost me, but such&#xD;
flyers as they were! Actual 2 m. 37j's I Ford built&#xD;
me a brett to hitch behind them; a light tasty affair,&#xD;
chocolate-color body,. and black Wheels picked out with&#xD;
verxnillion. The harness was simple and slight, with&#xD;
polished steel terrets, snaffles, and pole-chain; and alto.&#xD;
gather, when the ponies stood pawing their round glossy&#xD;
hoofs with. my man on the box, so trig in tops and&#xD;
cockaded hat, holding the reins as only an English&#xD;
domestic can, I assure you the whole affair was highly&#xD;
creditable to my taste and worth looking at. With&#xD;
boyish glee I anticipated displaying my turn-out to Miss&#xD;
Home, and indeed, she could hardly express her admira-&#xD;
tion and surprise when I dashed up to "The Maples"&#xD;
one fine afternoon, in most elegant and skilful style.&#xD;
"Such pretty ones!" exclaimed Lesbia,&#xD;
And so gentle," said I, "they will Stand like&#xD;
statues, all' aTone."&#xD;
"I don't admire that," said Lesbia, "I prefer horses&#xD;
a little restive."&#xD;
"Would you like to try them, Miss Home ?"&#xD;
"0 dear me, yes I" said Lesbia. "Wait a moment till&#xD;
I get my bonnet and gloves."&#xD;
&#xD;
* She reappeared provided with hat and parasol4vhip.&#xD;
"You (lon't need a whip. I've got one, and they'll&#xD;
go fast enough, I'll warrant," said I.&#xD;
"how simple you are, I must shade my eyes, and&#xD;
besides I don't fancy these gentle goers. I must drive.&#xD;
I dislike your tractable natures. I like opposition, and&#xD;
shall whip them to spoil their temper."&#xD;
She touched them merely with the tip of the lash and&#xD;
off they sprang like startled stags. "hold them in,"&#xD;
cried I, attempting to assist her. "Stop," she replied in&#xD;
her wilful way~ "Don't you see I can manage them'?"&#xD;
The ponies tugged at the bit like eager greyhounds from&#xD;
the slips, but Lesbia held them bravely, and was over-&#xD;
joyed at the speed they displayed. In sooth, they fairly&#xD;
"devoured the plain," whilst I, enrapturedwatched the&#xD;
glorious face beside me, all animation like Diana's at&#xD;
the chase, lips half-parted, eyes a4ight, bonnet, scarf, and&#xD;
glossy curls swept back by the breezy rush, and all in&#xD;
such graceful, captivating disorder, that I would gladly&#xD;
have ridden around the globe with her in the same&#xD;
style.&#xD;
At King's-bridge we turned to go back, and though I&#xD;
could not indulge in any sentiment owing to my man&#xD;
on the back seat, yet I was well repaid in healing her,&#xD;
when we alighted, utter such rapturous praises of my&#xD;
little equipage.&#xD;
"I never saw such elegant little horses and so fast,&#xD;
too. Dear me, what a pleasure it is to drive them! I&#xD;
don't know when I have had so much enjoyment."&#xD;
"I am very happy to hear you say so, Lesbia. Since&#xD;
they are so much to your taste I place them at your dis.&#xD;
posal. Will you accept of them? I have others."&#xD;

"0, no, thank you. I3ut are they yours ?" she said&#xD;
with a slight expression of surprise, "I thought "-she&#xD;
checked herself and bit her lip.&#xD;
"Yout thought," said I with sly relish, "that I was a&#xD;
poverty..stricken dependent, perhaps. I fancied as&#xD;

These were unlucky words of mine, for I saw her lip&#xD;

more about it or we shall quarrel."&#xD;
She was not one to brook a taunt, and abashed I sub.&#xD;
emitted in silence to her reproof. Then in hasty retreat&#xD;
I sprang into my waggon, lashed my vexation on the&#xD;
innocent ponies, and sent them rushing homewards,&#xD;
while, amid hot sighs, I breathed out, "Great God! If&#xD;
I could only snap this link! If I could but summon&#xD;

had her lengthened and her rig altered, and under a good&#xD;
sailing-master she succeeded in carrying off a silver&#xD;
punch-bowl at the club regatta. This gave me some&#xD;
~clat, and between my fast horses and fast yacht, my&#xD;
dashing away at Newport and Saratoga and my princely&#xD;
way pf scattering eagles, I acquired a certain renown~ as&#xD;
a man of fashion and wealth, and was sought after by&#xD;
the most select and tonnish sets,&#xD;
I now affected a nonchalant air towards Miss Home,&#xD;
and even tried to quiz her. I made it a point of being&#xD;
present at all the parties which I supposed she would&#xD;
attend, and was there exuberantly gallant to all other&#xD;
belles. I strove by every means in my power to excite&#xD;
her jealousy; praised every pretty face I saw and pre-&#xD;
tended to be much taken with it, or with an easy famiW&#xD;
arity showed her some cos1~ly gifts which I intended for&#xD;
Cora Goldistofle. I was, also, continually enthusiastic&#xD;
about this one's eyes, that one's complexion or figure,&#xD;
and praised other damsels until I fancied the vain beauty&#xD;
was vexed, and seeing this, redoubled my efforts to&#xD;
bring the recalcitrant fair to a capitulation.&#xD;
My flourishing about in so magnificent and eccentric&#xD;
a style made me the town talk, and I was dubbed&#xD;
"Count." I was the object of many a newspaper squib,&#xD;
and an interminable quantity of marvellous tattle was&#xD;
circulated in reference to my wealth, my adventures, and&#xD;
my mode of life; the most of it idle gossip without any&#xD;

Nfl what was Myndert about, while his brother was&#xD;
frittering away the best years of his life and sqi~an-&#xD;
dering his dollars like a fool?* Myndert was not only&#xD;
amassing wealth, but by his conduct acquiring the&#xD;
friendship and esteem of all among those that knew&#xD;
him whose friendship and esteem were worth having.&#xD;
For a long time he had held certain ideas in regard to&#xD;
the elevation of the working classes, which it was his con-&#xD;
stant and cherished desire to mould into a practicable&#xD;
system. None of the theories on that subject which he&#xD;
had ~tndied seemed to meet his views, and as a prelimi-&#xD;
nary to his plan whereby artisans could acquire all the&#xD;
profit possible from their labor without paying a tax to&#xD;
capitalist~ or~ to traffickers in industry, he entitled his&#xD;
workmen to receive, besides their stated wages, a certain&#xD;
dividend Qf the profits realized by him. True, he had&#xD;

already acquired a fortune and only admitted his co~&#xD;
laborers to share at the eleventh hour, but it should&#xD;
be borne in mind that his scheme was but experi-&#xD;
mental, and had he begun business on such a system&#xD;
he might have failed at the outset, and thus have&#xD;
precluded forever a renewal on his part of such 1~n&#xD;
attempt. Now he felt better able to push his experi-&#xD;
ment to a fair trial.&#xD;
His plan comprised the feature of enabling the men to&#xD;
purchase their comestibles of the producer, as far as&#xD;
possible, and thus save shop-keeper's profit, and he&#xD;
intended eventually to gather around the nucleus formed)&#xD;
other tradesmen, and thus lighten the burden which the&#xD;
sons of toil bear for the multitude of drones in the&#xD;
social hive; his theory being based on the fact well-known&#xD;
to economists, namely; that were all the human family&#xD;
to work five hours every day they would be enabled to&#xD;
enjoy every comfort and many of the luxuries which,&#xD;
under the actual state of society, only the wealthy can&#xD;
command. True, he saw not clearly how this desirable&#xD;
condition of things was to be brought about, but mean-&#xD;
while he deemed it the best plan, instead of calling on&#xD;
Hercules, to put his shoulder to the wheel and further it&#xD;
to the extent of his abilities.&#xD;
By such sincere and unselfish efforts in behalf of his fel-.&#xD;
lows, he earned an enviable reputation, and was, by the&#xD;
influence of the ship-carpenters, who formed a numerous&#xD;
and respectable body of citizens, nominated as a candi-&#xD;
date to represent his district in Congress.&#xD;
Myndert was no politician. The chicaiiery of the&#xD;
trade disgusted him. But he was ambitious and aware&#xD;
of the opportunity a seat in the National councils would&#xD;

11&#xD;

GARRET VAN HORN.             823&#xD;
give him to expound and promulgate his ideas. He there-&#xD;
fore gladly allowed himself to be used as~ a candidate&#xD;
for Congressman. At this time there happened to be&#xD;
a movement on foot for the organization of a some party&#xD;
whosQ anilnus or leading principle was the restriction&#xD;
of the right of suffrage and office-holding to native-born&#xD;
citizens, in order, as they held, to bring about a better&#xD;
and more patriotic administration of the government.&#xD;
~Iyndert being known as an opponent of any foreign&#xD;
inflacuce in our national policy, his friends considered&#xD;
him a most suitable standard-bearer around whom they&#xD;
might rally their forces with those of the new party.&#xD;
But unfortunately for their hopes, on the test-questions&#xD;
being put to him, Myndert was found ineligible by the&#xD;
leaders of the nativists. He frankly told them that&#xD;
though they might have cause for resentment against&#xD;
many of the adopted citizens, yet an American should&#xD;
ever avoid advocating any measure that savored or&#xD;
approached in the slightest degree towards proscription.&#xD;
He also ridiculed the idea that our liberties could be in&#xD;
any way endangered by, comparatively speaking, so small&#xD;
a number of our population; and in his plain practical&#xD;
way he showed them~dth pen and paper, that in a few&#xD;
years that number would become proportionally insig~&#xD;
nificant. "But gentlemen," added he, "there are other&#xD;
questions of vastly more importance demanding ~your&#xD;
attention. Look at the clothes you wear. The cloth&#xD;
of your coat was made in England, the silk of your vest&#xD;
in France, the linen of your' shirt in Ireland, the stock-&#xD;
ings you wear in Scotland, your black-silk cravat in&#xD;
Italy, why is this? Are Americans so incapable or lazy&#xD;
that~ they cannot make these things?"&#xD;

"Because they ~re sold to us here cheaper by those&#xD;
nations than we can make them," replied one.&#xD;
"And why can they make them cheaper? You will&#xD;
say because labor is less paid with them. And for this&#xD;
we must be deprived of the knowledge and practice of&#xD;
those arts and handicrafts wherein we come in competi-&#xD;
tion with foreign fabricants."&#xD;
"Wherein do we lose ?" said another. "We have a&#xD;
vast extent of territory, raise more than we can con-&#xD;
sume, other nations need our cotton and wheat, we&#xD;
supply them in exchange for their productions, this&#xD;
induces commerce, both are benefited, we in obtaining&#xD;
cloths and silks far cheaper than we could make them,&#xD;
and they in receiving cheap bread and raw materials,"&#xD;
"Suppose our crops fail, how then? Granting even&#xD;
that they will always be super-abundant you would&#xD;
transform us all into agriculturists and traffickers.&#xD;
Which class of people do you suppose are the most&#xD;
intelligent, they who cultivate cotton wool, or they&#xD;
who spin and weave and dye it? Which calls into&#xD;
action the moat ingenuity and intellect.-to raise rye, or&#xD;
to make that watch in your pocket which comes, of&#xD;
course, from Switzerland, I admit that agriculture&#xD;
properly conducted needs study and intelligence; but&#xD;
the fact remains that soil-tillers are but mere machines,&#xD;
and have not that incentive to inquiry and thought&#xD;
which the mechanic finds amid the many wonders and&#xD;
appliances of mechanical science, Look, gentlemen,&#xD;
he continued, pointing to a schooner on the stocks (this&#xD;
conversation was held ~in his office) "that is intended&#xD;
for a gun-boat for the IMexicans, for which I am to&#xD;
receive a fe~y kegs of silver dollars, silver dug from&#xD;

exchange is made, this country or Mexico? We get a&#xD;
lot of dollars useless in themselves except, perhaps, to&#xD;
make spoons ~f-they receive an instrument useful in a&#xD;
variety of ways.&#xD;
"We will be the richer, I take it," said one.&#xD;
"Why so&#xD;
"Because, riches consist in the precious metals."&#xD;
"But they have, perhaps, an almost inexhaustible sup-&#xD;
ply in their mines which any fool can dig out and smelt."&#xD;
"In that view of the case they are the better off, for&#xD;
they have, as you say, a useful thing for one in reality&#xD;
valueless."&#xD;
"Y~s; but again we can make as many schooners&#xD;
as we choose while they, although possessing all the&#xD;
materials, are perhaps unable to construct one properly.&#xD;
Thus we are the richer, because we possess a certain&#xD;
knowledge and skill which they do not, Such occupa-&#xD;
tions as mining or raising jalap tend but little to&#xD;
exercise or instruct the mental faculties of man, and&#xD;
therefore, those engaged in such labors are. far inferior&#xD;
in intelligence, to carpenters or blacksmiths. Yet, were&#xD;
it not that timber is so abundant and cheap with us, we&#xD;
might even be deprived of this branch ~f industry, and&#xD;
like the Mexicans purchase our ships as we do our pen-&#xD;
knives from other countries, Owing to the short-&#xD;
sighted. policy of our government, which fails to protect&#xD;
the native manufacturer, we now send abroad our cotton&#xD;
and pay to have it spun, twisted, wove, and returned to&#xD;
us in thread and sheets, which is as sensible a thing as it&#xD;
would be to send our flour over the sea and buy it back&#xD;
when baked into bread."&#xD;

"Competition is the life of trade," suggested a&#xD;
sceptic.&#xD;
"Aye, genuine competition among ourselves; but&#xD;
not competition with the poorly paid and haWstarved&#xD;
operatives of Europe. Moreover, as I think it the un-&#xD;
deniable right of all who labor to obtain as much for&#xD;
their work as the demands and necessities of trade will&#xD;
admit, unless foreign competition be excluded, it is&#xD;
hardly possible for artisans to effectually combine and&#xD;
protect themselves against the oppression of capital.&#xD;
For capital is like fire, a good servant, but a soulless&#xD;
tyrant if he get the upper hand."&#xD;
All these notions were but little to the taste of the&#xD;
deputation who were filled with a vague dread of&#xD;
foi'eigners and Jesuits, and utterly blind to the real&#xD;
injury that Free-trade doctrines and insufficient protect~&#xD;
tion inflicted on the country. As they liked the man,&#xD;
however, they. endeavored to induce him to waive his&#xD;
convictions and attach himself to their cause; but Myn-&#xD;
dert was too little of the politician to agree to that, he&#xD;
always spoke what he thought, and understood not&#xD;
dissimulation, consequently, he was set aside and a&#xD;
supple man selected, but not until his workmen, all&#xD;
staunch native-born Americans, had done everything in&#xD;
their power to induce the new party to accept him even&#xD;
with his unpopular opinions, so reliant were they on his&#xD;
thorough probity and patriotism. All their efforts, how-&#xD;
ever, proved unavailing, and Myndert lost the election&#xD;
which was carried by the nativists. He was not a&#xD;
little disappointed at this defeat, for he had desired a&#xD;
seat in Congress chiefly because it would give him more&#xD;
brain-toil and thereby replace certain thoughts by&#xD;

GARRET VAN HORN.             827&#xD;
others more healthy and fruitful. For it is not only the&#xD;
guilty who need to banish reflection, but the guiltless&#xD;
as well, and Myndert, though clever and good, was at&#xD;
times, perhaps, more unhappy than a wicked wretch.&#xD;
The cause of his sorrow was a laughable one-to others,&#xD;
as such causes always are. He had loved and was&#xD;
rejected, and still he loved. The Laird of Dumbiedikes,&#xD;
after a long and patient homage, as he deemed but&#xD;
~ ventured abruptly to offer his hand and heart to&#xD;
Miss Home. It never transpired in what terms he con-&#xD;
veyed his proposal, but this much is authentic. Lesbian,&#xD;
startled, merely raised her eyebrows and listened to the&#xD;
'postulant. Although always pleased and even amused&#xD;
with this admirer's peculiarities, yet she had never&#xD;
reflected upon such a juncture as this. However, in-&#xD;
stead of quizzing or laughing at him, she replied&#xD;
seriously and in a far different~ manner from her usual&#xD;
bantering way:&#xD;
"Myndert, I like you very much indeed (Poor ~Iyn-&#xD;
dert's heart dilated with joy), but not enough to accept&#xD;
you for a husband (As quickly did. Myndert sink to&#xD;
despair), I could not marry without loving, and Myn-&#xD;
dert I do not love you. I esteem and respect you very,~&#xD;
very much, but for some reason I never looked upon you&#xD;
even as a suitor. You are different from the other gentle-&#xD;
men who visit at this house, you ar~ deverer and more&#xD;
sincere. I respect you above them all, but to be candid,&#xD;
I must frankly admit I do not enjoy your society as&#xD;
I do that of others. You never could be happy with&#xD;

have felt disappointed-because I should have prized&#xD;
any praise from you so highly-so certain am I you do&#xD;
not flatter. But it is idle to talk in this way, and very&#xD;
foolish in me You are so much wiser, I know, than I&#xD;
am, and deserve a wife able to appreciate you and make&#xD;
you happy. But I never could-there, let us forget all&#xD;
this as quickly as possible and still be good friends.&#xD;
You will forgive me for talking so, won't you? And&#xD;
you will not be angry with me?"&#xD;
She said this in so kind arid cordial a way that poor&#xD;
Myndert ma~de a wretched effort to appear reconciled.&#xD;
She noticed his pained expression, and said in an anxious&#xD;
tone, "Surely you are not sad at what I have said? I&#xD;
have not pained you, have. I ?"&#xD;
"No-no," replied Myndert. Truthful tongues must&#xD;
lie, sometimes, and the thoughtless girl could not con-&#xD;
ceive the depth of affection in the strong earnest nature&#xD;
that sued her.&#xD;
This disappointment caused him to seek relief in some&#xD;
employment that would demand close application, con-&#xD;
stant thought, and afford a counter-acting excitement.&#xD;
Accordingly after his defeat in the. election for Con-&#xD;
gressmen, he set about with increased zeal to l)CrfCCt his&#xD;
plan of transforming his works into a complete mutual&#xD;
benefit association, or rather a sort of pimlanstery of&#xD;
labQr, where. the workers were entitled to vote and elect&#xD;
from among themselves certain officers to direct the&#xD;
organization. Myndert furnished the capital or motor,&#xD;
for which ho received but a very moderate rate of&#xD;
interest, and w~s in a certain degree "the power behind&#xD;
the tlirone2'&#xD;
Matters went on swimmingly; the workmen were&#xD;
&#xD;
delighted with th~ scheme and its results; and at length&#xD;
Myndert, finding that the association was able to stand&#xD;
alone, took the opportunity to indulge in relaxation and&#xD;
recreation and departed on a long contemplated visit to&#xD;
the ~ld world,&#xD;

CHAPTER XXI,&#xD;
A BOLD STROKE FOR A WIFE,&#xD;
W fILE Miss Home was spending some summer days&#xD;
with her friend Laura Ludlow, I took the oppor-&#xD;
tunity of cruising about the Sound in my yacht Hebe,&#xD;
and dropping anchor off Marshall's Neck.&#xD;
Marshall's Neck is in Fairfield county, Connecticut,&#xD;
and situated at no great distance from the boundary line&#xD;
at Byram River. This is a pleasant stream running into&#xD;
Long Island Sound, and crossed at the town of Port-&#xD;
chester, as the old village of Saw-Pits is now called, by&#xD;
a bridge which connects New York with the New Eng-&#xD;
land states. The instant you enter into the land of&#xD;
steady habits nature displays a different aspect. At&#xD;
once the landscape becomes broken and hilly, and full of&#xD;
romantic beauty, bought however at the price of an&#xD;
ungrateful soil. About a league from the State line on&#xD;
the turnpike we come to the village of Horseneck, and a&#xD;
&#xD;
GAI~REr1r V  HORS.          331&#xD;
&#xD;
half-mile or so onward, hard-by the Episcopal church,&#xD;
may be found Put's Hill, the precipice adown which the&#xD;
brave old soldier rode amid a shower of British bullets.&#xD;
To the left is a round-about road which is the way the&#xD;
fox-hunting Eritish prudently took, but since that day,&#xD;
by drill and blast, a road has been cut through the hill&#xD;
which, though not steep in comparison with the original&#xD;
declivity, we probably should not like to descend astride&#xD;
a l4orse at a breakneck pace. At a little distance&#xD;
beyond and near Cos-cob harbor lies Marshall's Neck,&#xD;
jutting into the Sound and comprising several hundred&#xD;
acres of land with but two houses on it, one the old&#xD;
dilapidated Marshall homestead and the other the new&#xD;
Ludlow mansion in all the severity and grandeur of white&#xD;
painted pediment, and big hollow fluted columns. A&#xD;
wild isolated spot, it was thereabout, with bold rocky&#xD;
shores washed by pure blue water; black jagged boul-&#xD;
ders covered with sea-xveed and bladder-wrack; and little&#xD;
sandy coves where the sheldrake and snipe waded;&#xD;
while back of the meadows, in the dense dark forest, the&#xD;
hawk, king-fisher and cat-bird, mink and woodchuck,&#xD;
dwelt undisturbed by man. Briefly, here was a pleni-&#xD;
tude of charms for the appreciative eye of poet or&#xD;
painter.&#xD;
But I was drawn thither by other attractions than&#xD;
scenic beauties, and Laura, surprised at my appearance,&#xD;
looked very incredulous when I said I had no idea that&#xD;
Miss Home was staying with her. Fortunately, Laura&#xD;
had other visitors and dangers, and I was relieved from&#xD;
much attendance on her and better able to pursue my&#xD;
suit with Lesbia. But alas! she seemed indisposed to&#xD;
accept my attentions, and but once only had.I the oppor-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7699-00000167"/>&#xD;
882&#xD;
&#xD;
GARRET' 'VAN HORN.&#xD;
&#xD;
unity of a t~te-d~tCte. The yacht, of course, was put to&#xD;
constant use and afforded much pleasure to all and espe-&#xD;
cially to Lesbia, who always enjoyed any active open-&#xD;
air sport with as great a zest as any young man. Like&#xD;
Diana of Poictiers, she knew the value of exercise in&#xD;
preserving that rich velvety bloom, that sparkle of eye,,&#xD;
and lustre of hair.&#xD;
One afternoon, just after a sharp shower which had&#xD;
cooled the atmosphere and left a stiff nor'west breeze&#xD;
blowing, I suggested that we should take a~ sail as it was&#xD;
a favorable time to put the boat to her speed. All the&#xD;
ladies save Lesbia objected, for they feared to venture&#xD;
on the Sound when the white-caps danced so merrily.&#xD;
I did not attempt to allay their apprehensions, and was&#xD;
as impatient as fire when I saw Lesbia trying in every&#xD;
way to persuade them to go. Luckily their dread over-&#xD;
came their desire, but Lesbia unable to resist the temp-&#xD;
tation decided after a little hesitation to accompany me.&#xD;
The Hebe lay moored in a little inlet near the Neck.&#xD;
Hailing him, the boat-keeper caine ashore in the yawl to&#xD;
take us on board, but we found that all the other hands&#xD;
had gone to a camp-meeting held in the environs. Too&#xD;
impatient to wait, I set about cheerily with my solitary&#xD;
assistant to get the craft under way. We hoisted the&#xD;
mainsail and jib and weighed anchor, while Lesbia stood&#xD;
at the tiller as seli~possessed as Grace Darling.&#xD;
Out glided the Hebe into the open Sound, as stately as&#xD;
a swan, then, filled with the rushing breeze, she bent&#xD;
over like a sapling, and increased her speed until the&#xD;
water curled up before her in frothy jets.&#xD;
Lesbian went forward to watch the wedge-like bow&#xD;
cut the hissing waves, whilst I, at the helm, enjoyed&#xD;
&#xD;
88S&#xD;
that triumph of mind over matter which caused the&#xD;
yacht at every touch of my hand to course, curvet, and&#xD;
halt like a trained steed.&#xD;
The day was on the wane. In the west over the&#xD;
horizon hung a mass of inky clouds pregnant with rain,&#xD;
from beneath which the effulgence of the setting sun&#xD;
shone like a broad bar of beaten gold. And so splendid&#xD;
a sky! for the late shower had dissolved the clouds into&#xD;
lilac and silver fleeces, that changed in hue 'as they&#xD;
floated beneath the azure world-roof,&#xD;
Lesbian stood gazing on the scene with beaming face.&#xD;
Any pleasure spiced with danger delighted her. She&#xD;
would have gone a-ballooning any day had an oppor-&#xD;
tunity presented itself, and doubtless would rather&#xD;
have preferred driving a locomotive than not, could&#xD;
it have been done with any degree of grace or ele-&#xD;
gance.&#xD;
The boat-keeper was forward, and having a clear&#xD;
field II tried gradually to introduce the topic which&#xD;
absorbed my thoughts and wishes. Lesbian had much&#xD;
to say about the sun, the sky, the glad waters, the&#xD;
Ocean's unwrinkled brow, Odin's white horses, and the&#xD;
delightful way we were speeding. I was also senti-&#xD;
mental, and spoke of the sloop as "my bark," and of&#xD;
her bow as the "prow." This was well enough, but&#xD;
when I said the ilebe carried Qesar and his fortunes,&#xD;
and hinted at her cruelty and my martyrdom, com-&#xD;
paring myself to the wounded hart after the manner of&#xD;
Mr. Pope to the charming Mary Moniague, and making&#xD;
myself otherwise tender and lover-like, she turned aside&#xD;
With an air of vexation which I could only dispel by&#xD;
resorting to praise and flattery. She was never tired&#xD;

of that, aud could have listened forever to sweet adula-&#xD;
tion. Certainly, it was almost as impossible t~ exagge-&#xD;
rate her comeliness as it was to sate her with praises of&#xD;
it, and the task was decidedly to my taste; but if I&#xD;
ventured to breathe foi~'th the passion that consumed&#xD;
me, she would curl her lip with an air of weariness that&#xD;
would instantly have checked any less ardent lover. I&#xD;
may have been stupid and ridiculous about it, likely&#xD;
enough, for my love-addresses never arose to that&#xD;
elegance of diction, nor exhibited any of that poetic&#xD;
pathos which we learn from novels and plays invariably&#xD;
characterizes the conrtships of other people, be they&#xD;
rustics or gentle. I, on the contrary, was at such&#xD;
moments, to speak frankly, less rational than at others.&#xD;
Nevertheless, whether silly or not, I was certainly sin-&#xD;
cere when I asked Lesbia what I could do-O, what&#xD;
could 1 do to prove to her that I adored her-that I&#xD;
worshipped her?&#xD;
"Cease telling me of it," she replied, rather curtly.&#xD;
"Lesbia, you are cruel. You know that is a task&#xD;
beyond my powers. Do not deprive me of the little&#xD;
consolation the expression of my love affords me. How&#xD;
could I exist without it ?"&#xD;
"Do you fear the worm that feeds on damask&#xD;
cheeks ?"&#xD;
"I may turn food for earthwornv~ before long if you&#xD;
continue to treat me in this scornful way," said I, with&#xD;
solemn silliness.&#xD;
Great was her merriment at my woful expression, and&#xD;
she laughed so long, looking the while so beautiful and&#xD;
mocking, that I could have bitten her for sheer spite.&#xD;
"Dear-dear, and has it come to this. Poor fellow, I&#xD;
&#xD;
GARRET VAN HORN.&#xD;

&#xD;
must surely pity him, or he may be driven to injure him-&#xD;
selV'&#xD;
"Lesbia, listen. The moment has at last arrived&#xD;
which seals my fhte, one word from you"&#xD;
"Mercy on me! Have I not sealed it often enough?&#xD;
Do let it remain sealed."&#xD;
"Miss home," said I, seriously, "a truce to your&#xD;
jests. If I cannot gain your love, I believe I am&#xD;
entitled to your respect. One who has been so devoted,&#xD;
so attached as I have, might at least expect some little&#xD;
return for his respectful homage other than ill-concealed&#xD;
contempt and spurning words."&#xD;
"So attached, so devoted, indeed! What a droll&#xD;
creature you are. Pray, sir, did you ever, or do you&#xD;
entertain any-any regard, for me ?"&#xD;
"Regard! No-no--.LovE!! How can you ask such&#xD;
a question~ ?" cried I, with a look of concentrated&#xD;
reproach and affection.&#xD;
"Begging your pardon, sir, I don't believe a word of it.&#xD;
There is but one person you love sincerely and devotedly."&#xD;
"Who ?" I inquired with surprise.&#xD;
"Your own dear, darling-self!"&#xD;
"Miss Home, grant me but an opportunity-give me&#xD;
but a chance of proving my self-sacrificing, intense,&#xD;
everlasting affection for you !"&#xD;
"What would you do, pray? Could you resign your&#xD;
mustaches-go ~~ithout your dinner-black your own&#xD;
boots ?"&#xD;
"Lesbia-Lesbia !-I beseech you! 0 that the age&#xD;
of chivalry were yet that I might shatter lances for your&#xD;
sake, and convince you by doughty deeds that all I say&#xD;
is true !"&#xD;

"But in these degenerate days that's out of the&#xD;
question, isn't it? What a shame! And yet, perhaps,&#xD;
you might do something in a-menagery, for instance.&#xD;
Suppose I were to throw my glove into a tiger's cage, or&#xD;
among the leopards and bears and monkeys, and bid you&#xD;
return it to me. Could you-would you do it ?"&#xD;
"Would I! Ten thousand famished tigers wouldn't&#xD;
appal me in such a cause! Lesbian, you smile, but&#xD;
believe me, I would cheerfully give all I possess for&#xD;
one, but onO, opportunity of risking my life to save&#xD;
yours."&#xD;
"Indeed! that's magnanimous, I'm sure. Yet I&#xD;
should not like to put you to the test, Sir Knight; I&#xD;
fear me your heart might fail you at the juncture.&#xD;
You're not excessively brave, or rather, I should say,&#xD;
you re commendably cautious."&#xD;
She meant merely to tantalize, but she stung me&#xD;
sharply. Galled by her ridicule my mind was excited&#xD;
to such a pitch that I was ready for any mad prank.&#xD;
Did she deem me ~ simpleton? 0 for some test to&#xD;
show her how she misjudged me! and to amaze her with&#xD;
an exhibition of that reckless determined will, that I&#xD;
could summon to resist any attack on my self-love!&#xD;
I spoke not and turned my gaze sternly aside, while&#xD;
she scanned my face to see how far I was angered.&#xD;
We were fast approaching Ca~ptain's Island, and in a&#xD;
trice I had formed a desperate resolve.&#xD;
Lesbian began maliciously to quote: "Why so mute&#xD;
and pale, fond lover ?" etc., while I sullen and silent&#xD;
kept steering straight for the island. Presently, the&#xD;
man at the bow sprang up and shouted, "Hard down,&#xD;
sir-hard down! or we'll be on the reef!"&#xD;
&#xD;
336&#xD;
&#xD;
GARRET VA~ HO~.&#xD;
Turning to Lesbia, I said, "Now you will see how&#xD;
you have misjudged me."&#xD;
JJard!y were these words spoken when the liebe&#xD;
struck the rocks, stem on, with a dull, grinding,&#xD;
wrenching sound dire to hear!&#xD;
So great was her impetus that the shock overbalanced&#xD;
me, and I fell heavily, striking my head against the&#xD;
taiflail,&#xD;
Soon as I gathered my scattered wits I caught the&#xD;
painter to h~iul in the little yawl towed at our stern,&#xD;
but unfortunately the boat was swamped. And what&#xD;
dread seized me when I missed Lesbia! She was not&#xD;
in the cabin, and in an agon~r of terror I ran about the&#xD;
deck seeking her.&#xD;
The sails obstructed my view towards the island, but&#xD;
when I got forward, to my inexpressible relief and sur-&#xD;
prise, I espied her in the water, and swimming, aye,&#xD;
swimming like a very naiad! And this was the maiden&#xD;
I was to win by rescuing her from a watery grave!&#xD;
Demented loon!&#xD;
But there was no time to lose, for the yacht having&#xD;
listed was sinking fast, and so, accoutred as I was, I&#xD;
plunged in and followed in Lesbia's wake. She was soon&#xD;
ashore, and walked as briskly as she was able in her wet&#xD;
garments to a dwelling near the light-house.. A woman&#xD;
caine out to meet her, and in a short time she re-&#xD;
appeared dressed in coarse blue-checked clothes and&#xD;
looking none the less lovely for her involuntary bath.&#xD;
My man and I had also obtained dry clothes, and we&#xD;
all stood for some moments in sad contemplation of the&#xD;
fate of the trim little ilebe, that lay now about ten&#xD;
fathoms from the beach, submerged, the yeasty wave~&#xD;
15&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC7699-00000170"/>&#xD;
Ii&#xD;
&#xD;
roUing over her deck and nothing visible but her mast&#xD;
and sails. The sacrifice of a hare-brained lover at the&#xD;
shrine of an obdurate mistress.&#xD;
We borrowed a boat from the light-house kecpei',&#xD;
and after a smart pull of four miles reached the Neck.&#xD;
I own I felt very sheepish at my exploit and its&#xD;
results; but Miss Home, to my surprise, took it all as&#xD;
excellent sport. After we had landed and were walking&#xD;
together up a lonely lane to the house, I said, "Have I&#xD;
done enough, Lesbia, to prove that I am anything but&#xD;
the ~eli~h, cowardly simpleton you took me for? I&#xD;
have sacrificed a yacht costing me twenty thousand&#xD;
dollars, and "-"--.&#xD;
"0 dear, why did you say that? You've almost&#xD;
spoilt it all. It's so Yankee-like, and mercenary to&#xD;
estimate everything in dollars. You certainly did a&#xD;
very, gallant, knightly act. To be sure, you gave me a&#xD;
good ducking and endangered my life, and in revenge,&#xD;
I could not possibly permit you to have the gratifica-&#xD;
tion of saving it. Still I'll not disparage the most chi-&#xD;
valrous deed that was ever done to win my applause.&#xD;
Are you consoled ?"&#xD;
She gave me her hand, as she said this, like a duchess,&#xD;
and her fine eyes kindled with such an arch expression&#xD;
of conscious triumph, that I, enraptured, bent low and&#xD;
kissed her pink palm. Was I consoled? Aye, and&#xD;
recompensed, for believe me, I could have wrecked&#xD;
a squadron of three-deokers to win such thanks from&#xD;
her!&#xD;
How Laura stared and laughed to see us in our&#xD;
strange apparel, and certainly, we looked ridiculous&#xD;
&#xD;
enough. Of course, everybody condoled with me on the&#xD;
loss of my yacht, and congratulated Lesbia on her&#xD;
escape from drowning. But I was annoyed at the&#xD;
many requests to relate and explain the mishap, and&#xD;
more thau one covert' smile intimated that, either I was&#xD;
a very nuskilful sailor or Lesbia and I must have been&#xD;
at the time of the accident much pre-occupied with each&#xD;
other. This latter opinion gained ground, and formed&#xD;
the subject of many jests and witticisms, especially from&#xD;
Elkanah Hobby, who was so exceedingly facetious at&#xD;
our expense that Lesbia became greatly vexed, and&#xD;
revenged herself by treating poor innocent me with a&#xD;
degree of coolnes~ bordering on anger. Did that girl&#xD;
love me? Had my long, ardent, sustained attack upon&#xD;
her heart made any favorable effect? My conceit would&#xD;
not allow me to believe she held me in indifference, and&#xD;
yet, though she was generally friendly, familiar and&#xD;
happy in my society, at times she became very distant&#xD;
and cold, What caused this? Was it anything more&#xD;
than a natural fickleness? Did she in reality entertain&#xD;
a strong affection for me which she wished to conceal,&#xD;
or was it all but the play of the flirt amusing herself&#xD;
with a victim, like the angler with the fish upon his&#xD;
hook? Perplexed by these doubts, I vented my spleen&#xD;
in threadbare flings at the fickleness and vanity of&#xD;
woman; as if man were not as conceited as she is vain,&#xD;
as inconsistent as she is capricious, and in brief, as if he&#xD;
were not in every way as weak and as incomprehensible&#xD;
being as his companion, woman.&#xD;
Two days after the wrecking of the Hebe, Lesbia&#xD;
brought her visit to an abrupt close and returned home.&#xD;

She chose her moment of departure while I was at Cap-&#xD;
tain's Island, disposing of the sunken yacht, so as to&#xD;
avoid bidding me farewell. At least I fancied so, and&#xD;
when I returned to ~Marshall's Neck and found her not,&#xD;
I was in no amiable mood, you may well imagine, for my&#xD;
sun had set, and a was hi a \ and desolate to me,&#xD;
Speedily as I could, without appearing rude, I also&#xD;
returned to New York in ~ chase of my lady-love,&#xD;
to seek her once more, press her to an explanation, and&#xD;
ascertain my fate. "Too long," cried 1, heroically,&#xD;
"too long, cruel fair, hast thou trifled with an earnest&#xD;
heart. I must know at once whether bliss or black&#xD;
despair remains my destiny 1"&#xD;
I called at "The Maples." Mrs. Parking informed me&#xD;
that Mr. Home had gone to Canada, and that Miss&#xD;
Lesbian had left the day before with some friends to&#xD;
spend a week at Saratoga. Back I went to town, and&#xD;
sent my man and horses up by that evening's boat to&#xD;
Troy, while I made preparations to follow on the mor-&#xD;
row, and the day after that, the correspondents of the&#xD;
city journals informed an intelligent public of the im-&#xD;
portant fact that "Count Van Horn" had arrived at&#xD;

-had drunk five tumblers of Congress and three of&#xD;
Empire water, before breakfast,-driven a splendid&#xD;
pair of blood bays to the lake-.eaten fried potato-&#xD;
chips, and much more news to the same purpose. here&#xD;
I found, of course, acquaintances in abundance. The&#xD;
young ladies were very amiable, the papas genial, the&#xD;

my persistent pursuit. There was no room for doubt&#xD;
this time, Even my sanguine temperament could furnish&#xD;
no other explanation of the glacial reception I met with.&#xD;
If she were marble before, she was ice now. All my&#xD;
little stratagems failed, my audacity was powerless,&#xD;
flattery was of no avail, and my humble attentions met&#xD;
only cold, inexorable rebuffs, the more pointed and&#xD;
severe when contrasted with her cordial way of treating&#xD;
other aspirants. To what could I attribute this? But&#xD;
yesterday I basked in the sunshine of her smiles, and&#xD;
now she seemed to regard me almost with aversion.&#xD;
Was it caused by any act of mine? I-lad I unwittingly&#xD;
wounded her feelings, or did she, 0 dreaded thought!&#xD;
love another? Impossible! and yet I fretted and&#xD;
fumed and raged~ like a melo-dr~matic villain at the&#xD;
very idea. how ascertain the truth? Whom bribe&#xD;
to spy and reveal to me what I might dread to&#xD;
know?&#xD;
To solve the enigma I essayed several expedients,&#xD;
among them, that of turning hair-dresser for the pur-&#xD;
pose of enabling me to visit Lesbia, incognito, and the&#xD;
better to succeed in this design, took several lessons in&#xD;
the management of the comb and brush, from Monsieur&#xD;
Aristide Legros the world-renowned coiffeur.&#xD;
It was the day of the closing ball of the season that I&#xD;
officiated as Monsieur Legros' assistant. Miss Home&#xD;
was at Congress hall with her friends, the Kemtops, and&#xD;
the ladies were impatiently awaiting the arrival of Mon-&#xD;
sieur Legros and his accomplished assistant. Legros&#xD;
had forty female heads to dress that day, and conse-&#xD;
quently he began his rounds betimes. I accompanied&#xD;
him, disguised in a vile wig, spectacles, and French&#xD;

Julia, the eldest, had passed for a belle the previous&#xD;

Julia's "noble form," her "alabaster skin," and her&#xD;
"magnificent coronal of hair." Even I had insisted&#xD;

lock I had~ filched, and cherished, and~-pah! I shud-&#xD;
dered at the welcomee discovery. AId Monsieur&#xD;
Legros, the buck and the beau whose hair you curl or&#xD;
dye despise you for a base ~'rench barber, but you, so&#xD;
sly and close-mouthed, laugh2~n your sleeve at these&#xD;
dupes b~-fooled by the wadded, wigged, and powdered&#xD;
belles, you have seen in their natural ugliness.&#xD;
Whilst my master was occupied with Miss Julia, I&#xD;
waited on the younger Miss Bareges, whose sandy&#xD;
queues were merely to be oiled, plaited, and be-ribboned.&#xD;
When Monsieur had finished, Julia stood before the&#xD;
&#xD;
843&#xD;
&#xD;
mirror admiring herself, and mamma said, "How bee-&#xD;
uty-ful! you look, my dear. If you don't fetch Van&#xD;
Horn this night I'm mistaken." And she was mistaken,&#xD;
grievously so, for I would as lief have been shackled to&#xD;
a skeleton or to Cleopatra in her present condition of&#xD;
rags and bitumen, as to espouse such withered 'allure-&#xD;
ments in a slovenly peignoit.&#xD;
I dreaded our next call. I feared some terrifying reve-&#xD;
lation, some hideous exposure that would disenthrall me&#xD;
a~nd rudely break my faith in the superlative beauty of my&#xD;
goddess, Miss Home. But on recalling to mind how,&#xD;
after her accidental dip in the Sound, she had appeared&#xD;
glowingly radiant as Aphrodite rising from the sea-foam&#xD;
I was reassured; and more than reassured, when in the&#xD;
privilege accorded only to physicians and hair-dressers&#xD;
we penetrated to the ladies' apartments, and I beheld&#xD;
Lesbian in a simple attire more becoming than all the&#xD;
elaborateness of a ball-costume. I was repaid a hundred-&#xD;
fold for the trouble I had taken to effect this clandestine&#xD;
visit, and for the fifty-dollar fee to Monsieur Legros.&#xD;
He set me about doing the rough, simply combing the&#xD;
hair in preparation for his master touches. I fairly&#xD;
trembled with nervous delight as I touched thft elegant&#xD;
head, and loosened and spread its long, plentiful, satin-&#xD;
sheened, chestnut glory! What pleasure to palp those&#xD;
soft, silken filaments; to droop them in careless curves&#xD;
and rolls over the veined temples and cheek-roses, or&#xD;
about the round white throat. And as I gathered them&#xD;
into a thick mass, what an effort it required to refrain&#xD;
from pressing my lips to the loved locks! No doubt&#xD;
Lesbia thought me an awkward manipulator, for she&#xD;
tossed her head impatiently twice or thrice; I could&#xD;

I ~~1i&#xD;

&#xD;
have continued this dalliance till doomsday had not&#xD;
ruthless Monsieur Legros ordered me, in French, to&#xD;
wait on Mrs. Kemtop while he finished Miss Home's&#xD;
co~ff'ure.&#xD;
Gaulthier says, the Parisian comb achieves more&#xD;
charming embellishments than the Athenian chisel.&#xD;
Granted, if the former instrument be wielded by such a&#xD;
master-hand as Monsieur Legros, who with some quick&#xD;
weaving and a few rapid strokes of his comb could con-&#xD;
struct fillets, volutes, beads, and braids as symmetric as&#xD;
any cut from stone. -&#xD;
His task accomplished, exclamations of surprise and&#xD;
admiration at Lesbia's appearance arose from the other&#xD;
ladies. "How lovely! How sweet! How nice! How&#xD;
beautiful !" etc. Said Mrs. Kemtop; "J think, Lesbia,&#xD;
the smitten ones will lie thick as autumnal leaves to-&#xD;
night."&#xD;
Lesbian smiled.&#xD;
"As for that poor, hali~crazy Van Horn, it's all over&#xD;
with him now. You will certainly extinguish the last&#xD;
spark of reason remaining in his addled brain," con-&#xD;
tinued Mrs. Kemtop with' a short laugh.&#xD;
"I do hope the pertinacious fool will not annoy me,"&#xD;
replied Lesbia, with the emphasis of vexation. "He's&#xD;
such a conceited goose 'that he'll not take a dismissal,&#xD;
sharp or blunt."&#xD;
"Oh !-ow.---oo--.--o !" screeched Mrs. Kemtop, for in&#xD;
my agitation at Lesbia's words I had unintentionally&#xD;
given her back hair a sharp pull.&#xD;
"..Vutor/ ma1adZroit-1~te!" cried Monsieur Legros&#xD;
with admirable presence of mind. "J7~ t'en. I" added he,&#xD;
pushing me away.&#xD;

&#xD;
It was well he did so, and reminded me that I was for&#xD;
the moment but a hair-dresser, or I would have betrayed&#xD;
myself by retorting on, Miss Home with a stinging&#xD;
reproof. "Pertinacious fool,"-" conceited goose !"&#xD;
had she called me knave or villain, I could have borne&#xD;
it; anything but her contempt!&#xD;
I obeyed Monsieur Legros and went away, cut to the&#xD;
core by her cruel derision. Alas! the adage had proved&#xD;
but too true, and I had received the punishment of the&#xD;
listener.&#xD;
Angry,' sad, and crestfallen, I left Saratoga that&#xD;
eveinng at the very moment the heedless throng of&#xD;
pleasure-seekers were engaged in their frivolous joys.&#xD;
My blood-bays and baggage were perforce obliged to&#xD;
remain as hostages for the hotel-bill, which far exceeded&#xD;
in amount the ready money I had brought with me.&#xD;
As I landed in New York from the Albany boat and&#xD;
was riding up Barclay street in a hackney coach, we&#xD;
passed a gun-shop. I stopped and purchased a revolving-&#xD;
pistol. What vague, insane- idea possessed me, I know&#xD;
not, but I requested the man to load it. He did so,&#xD;
scrutinizing me the while rather curiously. I placed the&#xD;
weapon in my breast pocket, and proceeded to my&#xD;
hotel.&#xD;
There were several letters lying on my table: one&#xD;
contained wedding-cards; another in black borders&#xD;
announced the death of my aunt Mrs. Brinkerhoff;&#xD;
two others were demands for money from tradesmen;&#xD;
and one from the - Bank requested me to call and&#xD;
make my account good, which was overdrawn some&#xD;
five hundred dollars. I tossed it aside with a cynical&#xD;
smile. The end was fast approaching. IAove lost and&#xD;

money gone! No matter', I had yet a few dollars left,&#xD;
but not for the ignoble purpose of paying debts. Una-&#xD;
ble to resist the depressing effect of the tumultuous&#xD;
emotions that beset me, I resorted to that ancient and&#xD;
universal specific for a wounded heart: wine! glorious,&#xD;
invaluable, beneficent WINE!&#xD;
I ordered a sumptuous supper to be prepared and sum-&#xD;
moned a few roystering friends to enjoy it with me&#xD;
There were Stanhope and Eugene Kenitop, Colonel&#xD;
Fauquier of Virginia, Joe Hunter, and Fred Crosby;&#xD;
jolly companions every one, and we feasted and we&#xD;
rioted in right merry style. "Fortune, I defy thee 1" I&#xD;
cried with a beaker of Beaune at my lips. "Do thy&#xD;
worst !" I added through a mouthful of broiled wood-&#xD;
cock. "Sing, boys, sing!" I shouted wildly, and with&#xD;
dithyrambic glee we roared again and again, "0, Land-&#xD;
lord fill the flowing bowl until it doth run over," etc.&#xD;
At one o'clock in the morning we were 4i11 at table&#xD;
except Eugene Kemtop who was lying asleep on a&#xD;
lounge, and Joe hunter who was similarly occupied&#xD;
under the table. The room was so full of blue tobacco&#xD;
smoke that we could hardly distinguish each other. The&#xD;
Colonel proposed a game of blufl "Hang bluff!" said&#xD;
Fred Crosby (a passcd~1nidshipman) "lct'~ drink!" and&#xD;
he knocked off the neck of a bottle of green seal impe-&#xD;
rial champagne, frcpp~. Stanhope who could out-smoke&#xD;
Vesuvius, kept indefatigably burning cigars between his&#xD;
lips. I, having bawled myself hoarse, became some-&#xD;
what, subdued. I was tipsy, my vision glazed and cheek&#xD;
burning. I passed my arm around Stanhope's neck and&#xD;
whispered huskily and confidentially in his ear. I&#xD;
imparted to him all my sorrows and troubles, and drew&#xD;
&#xD;
[&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
347&#xD;
&#xD;
a rather incoherent sketch of my life from its earliest&#xD;
stage. "Stanhope, my dear boy, you see before you&#xD;
one doomed by dire destiny to blight and despair from&#xD;
childhood's hour. Misery has marked me for her own.&#xD;
Stanhope, you're the only friend I have now left in the&#xD;
world. Your's is the only willing ear into which I can&#xD;
pour my tale of wretchedness and woe." I shook hands&#xD;
with him here for several minutes in silent agitation, and&#xD;
then resumed: "Stanhope, behold a wreck! a dam&#xD;
infernal contemptible wreck! Left an orphan at tender&#xD;
years-thrown on the cold charity of the world-left&#xD;
to struggle like a-like a - Stanhope! why wasn't I&#xD;
strangled while I lay .a smiling, blessed babe in the&#xD;
cradle ?" I shrieked. "Stanhope, you're my friend (I&#xD;
again shook hands with him), you're my only and best&#xD;
friend, and I can confide in you, but Stanhope, I've been&#xD;
jilted! jilted, sir, ,and blasted-blasted in my tenderest,&#xD;
budding affections! If I could only find a hovel in the&#xD;
sandy desert of Sahara I'd go and live there, sir, like a&#xD;
dam old hermit in a cell, this very instant, Stanhope, this'&#xD;

"P11 tell you what you want, Van," said Stanhope,&#xD;
lighting a fresh cigar. "Your liver's torpid, old chap, a&#xD;
blue pill to-night and a Seidlitz pow "~.-&#xD;
"Blue pills be hanged! Stanhope Kemtop," I exclaim-&#xD;
ed, indignant at his proposal, "these 'are the only pills&#xD;
and powder for a man in my condition, " and after much&#xD;
fumbling in my pockets I drew forth the pistOl.&#xD;
"Let me see it," a~ked he, and taking the weapon he&#xD;
examuied it for a few seconds and returned it to me.&#xD;

I'd come and tell you~ for it's all the fault of her hus..&#xD;
band, sir, that doctor."&#xD;
"Sit down, Ann, sit down, and tell me what all this&#xD;
means."&#xD;
And the woman began to relate, in a rambling dis.&#xD;
connected way, a story of terrible interest to me, and&#xD;
from which I gathered the following revelations.&#xD;
It was the story of an artful knave and his victim;&#xD;
of the viliany of the one and the suffering of the other.&#xD;
How, for many many years, the scoundrel Edmund Rose&#xD;
had used my aunt Jane like a profitable slave; having&#xD;
caused her long a go to fall into his power by stratagem,&#xD;
and since that time living on the money he extorted&#xD;
from the unfortunate woman by threats of divulging&#xD;
certain proofs that would incriminate her, One of these&#xD;
was a note, a mere scrap of paper with a few heedless&#xD;
words which the simple woman had been inveigled, h&#xD;
a fatal moment, into writing by the arch intrigue; a&#xD;
wretched, ill-spelt missive, it was, with an unguarded&#xD;
phrase or two of admiration, that were, perhaps, not&#xD;
strictly improper, yet sufficient to compromise her in the&#xD;
eyes of her stern, precise, uncharitable husband. By&#xD;
means of this potent talisman Rose had possessed him-&#xD;
self of her diamond ear-rings, the loss of which she&#xD;
explained by the story ~f a robbery. This deception&#xD;
sealed her fate. She was completely entrapped. The&#xD;
schemer, armed with such additional and corroborative&#xD;
evidence, held it over the hapless wife like an overseer's&#xD;
whip, and forced her to supply him with the means to&#xD;
indulge in a luxurious existence. But the poor woman&#xD;
harassed by his constant and increasing demands and&#xD;
&#xD;
often terrified by his threats, sank into a state of ener-&#xD;
vated sorrow and sought relief in opiates. After the&#xD;
death of her husband she ~was driven by the same nefa-&#xD;
rious treatment into marrying her persecutor. His ill-&#xD;
usage now, changed only from sharp torment to harsh&#xD;
brutality; until her reason, already impaired by the per-&#xD;
nicious habit of laudanum drinking, crumbled away,&#xD;
and she w~s left a demented wreck.&#xD;
Such we 'e, in substance, the disclosures imparted to&#xD;
me, and which I heard at first with a nervous sort of&#xD;
exhilaration and wonderment, which rapidly gave place&#xD;
to intense anger. The enmity I bore him was increased&#xD;
by this revelation of his long-continued, base, and cruel&#xD;
machinations, to such a thirst for vengeance, that I was&#xD;
prepared to seek and kill him at all hazards!&#xD;
"God only knows," added the servant woman, "what&#xD;
that poor la4y-has suffered. For the ten long years that&#xD;
I waited on her, and seeing her a crying day by day and&#xD;
me never a knowing as anything ailed but the pain&#xD;
for which I bought the laudanum for her. Ah! sir, I&#xD;
never know'd meself until six weeks ago, sir, this bles-&#xD;
sed day, she told me all, for that very night, sir, she&#xD;
thought she would die and she said she couldn't die till&#xD;
she had told some one how she had suffered and what&#xD;
her troubles was, poor old lady! and she told me all.&#xD;
And I know'd, sir, as how she loved you like her own&#xD;
son and I'd thought I'd tell you to see if you could do&#xD;
anything to help her, for now her reason's gone and&#xD;
they'll lock her up out ~' the way."&#xD;
~' Who is with *her now, Ann ?"&#xD;
"Shure there's no one with her now, sir, but Mr.&#xD;
Rose, and his new man,"&#xD;

"You had better return, Ann, at once, and be ready to&#xD;
show me up to your mistress' room. I will be there&#xD;
very soon."&#xD;
I returned to my dressing room, pulled on my coat&#xD;
and boots, put the repeating-pistol in my pocket, and&#xD;
hurried off for Ufilversity Place.&#xD;
Th~ man who answered my ring was a new domestic,&#xD;
fdr I was unacquainted with him. I asked to see Mrs.&#xD;
Rose. He said she was ill and unable to receive visi-&#xD;
tors.&#xD;
Without further parleying I went up stairs followed&#xD;
by the man, who was probably surprised at my uncere-&#xD;
monious way.&#xD;
Ann was waiting at the door of her mistress' apart-&#xD;
ment to admit me. I entered. There in a rocking&#xD;
chair sat my Aunt Jane-a poor, wasted, white-haired&#xD;
lunatic, crooning wildly, and rocking herself to and fro.&#xD;
A broad leather belt was drawn across her thin body to&#xD;
prevent her from rising, but when she noticed me she&#xD;
pointed her skinny finger and gave a vacant, unearthly&#xD;
laugh. 0 piteous sight! 1 turned aside unable to&#xD;
bear the syectacle, and at that very moment Rose, who&#xD;
had been summoned by his man, entered. lie demand-&#xD;
ed, in a loud, imperious voice, what my business&#xD;
was? Without replying, I quickly drew my revolver,&#xD;
raised it at him and pulled the trigger. It missed fire,&#xD;
and Rose threw up his arms in terror, screaming, "For&#xD;
God's sake, don't murder me !" 'I cocked and failed again&#xD;
(for Stanhope Kemtop had removed the caps the night&#xD;
before), and then, wrought to a pitch of frenzy by my&#xD;
unsuccess, flung the pistol at his head with all my might&#xD;
and felled him. But his man seeing me disarmed&#xD;

GARRET VAN HORN.        358&#xD;
&#xD;
instantly seized a heavy chair, dealt me a violent blow&#xD;
on the back, which threw me down, and then beat me&#xD;
into insensibility.&#xD;
When I recovered I was in the hands of two police-&#xD;
men who took me to the station-house, Rose preferred&#xD;
his charge against me and I was locked up to spend the&#xD;
night in duress.&#xD;
ii sent a messenger for my valet Carter. lie came&#xD;
and I gave him directions to dispose of all my effects,&#xD;
settle some little bills, and retain the wages due lum.&#xD;
I now resigned myself to fate, for I felt neither the&#xD;
strength nor the inclination to stein the current of&#xD;
adversity, so strongly setting against me.&#xD;

J~ the Tombs. Twenty-four hours before I was&#xD;
I feasting on woodcock and champagne, and now I&#xD;
occupy a felon's cell.&#xD;
It all seems like a dream-~---or a terrible drama that I&#xD;
have witnessed, and the figure of my poor insane aunt&#xD;
rises so vividly before me, that I can hardly banish' it&#xD;
from my mind by any effort. But the poignant reality&#xD;
is here. This narrow chamber, that coarse pallet, the&#xD;
narrow slit admitting a few rays of light through the&#xD;
thick stone walls, and the grated door are no figments.&#xD;
And yet, why should I repine?&#xD;
My life, I feel, is~ virtually spent, and for the remain-&#xD;
der of my days I can have but one regret: that Idid&#xD;
not kill Rose. had I succeeded in doing this, I could&#xD;
have swung from a cross-beam with satisfaction!&#xD;
I buy a newspaper from the boy who furnishes the&#xD;
&#xD;
855&#xD;
&#xD;
prisoners. The police intelligence contains the follow-&#xD;
mo'.&#xD;
ATTEMPT TO I~ILL-.--Yesterday afternoon, officers Smith and Jones&#xD;
arrested Garret Van horn, a notorious adventurer, who has&#xD;
figured somewhat extensively among our fashionables under the&#xD;
alias of "Count Van horn," for a dastardly attempt upon the life of&#xD;
our estimable fellow-citizen Dr. E. Rose. The doctor it appears,&#xD;
was quietly walking out of his study, in his residence, No. -, Uni-&#xD;
versity Phiice, when the desperado, who had surreptitiously entered&#xD;
the house, rushed towards him with a levelled pistol; luckily it missed&#xD;
lire, when the doctor promptly dealt his assailant a powerful blow&#xD;
which prostrated him. Tie was then secured, handed over to the&#xD;
police, and, after an examination, committed to the Tombs to await&#xD;
the action of the Grand Jury.&#xD;
The news of my misfortune thus spread far and wide,&#xD;
and some acquaintances come to see me, but I refuse to&#xD;
be made either an object of curiosity or sympathy.&#xD;
One person insists upon speaking to me. It is Mr.&#xD;
Pethcoe, Mrs. Van Horn's former attorney, lie has&#xD;
heard of my mishap, he says, and he sincerely condoles&#xD;
with me. lie has also heard (incidentally) of Mrs. Van&#xD;
horn's misfortune, and he is sincerely sorry on her&#xD;
account too. She is now insane, he understands. Since&#xD;
Mi's. Van Horn's marriage, he has heard, incidentally (he&#xD;
hears everything incidentally, that cautious man) that&#xD;
Doctor Rose has disposed of the greater part of her&#xD;
estate. Rather a singular man, Doctor Rose, he should&#xD;
say, quite eccentric, in fact; so he has understood. Sad&#xD;
affair-sacV affair! have I retained counsel? No. He&#xD;
then mildly proffers the services of his son, a young&#xD;
lawyer of great parts, who has had much success in&#xD;
criminal cases, having thwarted justice in several critical&#xD;

instances, and if I desire it he will send him to me. bay&#xD;
I xviii think of it; and finally, he says "Good day," and&#xD;
nods himselPoff.&#xD;
For the moment it is a relief to be imprisoned, the&#xD;
stone walls shielding' me from an accusing world; and&#xD;
it is no small consolation that Myndert's absence spares&#xD;
me his knowledge of my condition. I am too apathetic&#xD;
to think of any method Of release, and sit brooding&#xD;
sullenly on my ill-luck with the pistol.&#xD;
A rapping on the door-grating with a key disturbs&#xD;
me. Another visitor: a woman this time, an elderly&#xD;
and motherly one, who introduces herself as Mrs. Hogg.&#xD;
Sure. enough, it is the wife of the old book-keeper, who&#xD;
states apologetically that Mr. Hogg is bed-ridden and&#xD;
unable to come himself and has therefore sent her to&#xD;
offer services and a basket which contains sandiviches,&#xD;
waffles, and fruit. Kind souls! and this from people&#xD;
whom I had almost forgotten, who never crossed my&#xD;
mind! How often in adversity do we find our only&#xD;
friends among those whom we have neglected in our&#xD;
.prosperity.&#xD;
Mrs. llogg says that they had a hard time of it after Mr.&#xD;
Hogg lost his place in A. Depeyster &amp;amp; Co. He was so&#xD;
trouble in mind that he fell sick, and they were obliged&#xD;
to sell their little house to support themselves. At&#xD;
length she opened a thread and needle shop-took in&#xD;
pinking and crimping-and now, they would get along&#xD;
comfortably enough, God be thanked! were it: not for&#xD;
poor Mr. Hogg, who suffered so from dropsy. She&#xD;
concludes by asking if she can be of service to me. I&#xD;
beg of her to put my watch and chain in pawn, as&#xD;
I shall need money to procure other meals than the&#xD;
&#xD;
GARRET VAN hORN..       357&#xD;
&#xD;
wretched prison fare. She returns with fifty dollars,&#xD;
and bidding me farewell, promises to call and see me&#xD;
again.&#xD;
I am surprised that Carter does not come and render&#xD;
account of his stewardship. Perhaps, has he de-&#xD;
camped with the avails of my effects? Likely enough,&#xD;
for my game is played and lost, and IL shall need him no&#xD;
longer.&#xD;
The cell I occupy is one of the lower tier, among&#xD;
those containing men imprisoned for grave crimes.&#xD;
In the opposite cells, I notice two or three faces&#xD;
peering through their gratings at the new comer.&#xD;
I am now an admitted member of the confraternity&#xD;
of criminals and outcasts, of the few unfortunates who&#xD;
suffer for the sins of the ~nany. And do they suffer?&#xD;
See the reckless hardened mien of those two burglars&#xD;
continually bantering each other; look at that mur-&#xD;
derer, who poisoned his wife by repeated doses while&#xD;
hypocritically sympathizing in her agonies; he lies&#xD;
on his back all day long singing snatches of comic and&#xD;
sentimental songs. Give them plenty of tobacco, and&#xD;
who so happy as they? No remorse tortures them.&#xD;
And why should they be more miserable than other&#xD;
~xiortals? These be but a small portion of the world's&#xD;

roam into the regions of reflection and analysis. A&#xD;
prison is a museum of comparative morality, where&#xD;
human nature presents itself in salient and phenomenal&#xD;
forms. Within its bars we behold the incOngruity&#xD;
and warped lQgic of society in its most glaring aspects;&#xD;
unless, blunted by long familiarity, we have become as&#xD;
insensible as that. turnkQy to whom assassins and pick-&#xD;
pockets are alike.&#xD;
A batch of prisoners have just arrived, transferred&#xD;
from an up-town jail in the "Black Maria." Th~ most&#xD;
of them deserve punishment as they are but penniless&#xD;
vagrants. They have been found drunk, and shall be&#xD;
penned for ten days apiece. I have been as tipsy as&#xD;
they, and as disorderly, and so was Stanhope Kemtop&#xD;
when we ripped off forty doctor and dentist signs i~i&#xD;
one night, but what magistrate would have dared corn-&#xD;
mit Alderman Kemtop's son and his friend? That&#xD;
tall long-shoreman in resenting a blow from a ship-&#xD;
master tore his assailant's ear with a cotton-hook,&#xD;
Mayhem is a serious offence, and he shall go to Sing-&#xD;
Sing for a few years, and his family must struggle&#xD;
for bread as best they can. Fifty dollars might save&#xD;
him, but where can he get them? My late revered&#xD;
uncle never got into a fight, or struck a body in his life,&#xD;
yet he brought more misery on his fellow-creatures&#xD;
through easy, respectable, opium trafile and bubble&#xD;
companies, than a thousand such ruffians as the steve-&#xD;
dore.&#xD;
In the "Penitentiary cell" beside ix~e, are three boys&#xD;
discussing the histrionic merits of J. R. Scott and&#xD;

cheek and leering eye to see her friend Chips, the&#xD;
gambler, in for cheating a "yank" at a skin-game of&#xD;
fare. In Chips I recognize the man in the fur-collar&#xD;
who gave me a ride in his waggon that night of the&#xD;
masquerade, and a smart natty f~lIow he is, with a&#xD;
classic profile, and a frame like an Apollo, though the&#xD;
sleeves of his claret colored frock-coat are Wo full of&#xD;
swelling muscles to allow him to pass for a gentleman.&#xD;
his grey eye is clear as a hawk's, and that cicatrix near&#xD;
his temple he caught from a "greaser" when bravely&#xD;
leading a storming column at Chapultepec, for Chips&#xD;
commanded a volunteer company in the Mexican war.&#xD;
Up to anything too that can be done with dice or&#xD;

thimble-riggers on the Centreville track. Chips knows&#xD;
me by sight well enough, as who in the city does not,&#xD;
and sends me his compliments and a box of Londres,&#xD;
begging me to help myself. Why should I refuse?&#xD;
Are we not both under the ban? I accept, and find&#xD;
the cigars excellent.&#xD;

I remained in prison six months, when Rose having&#xD;
failed to appear and prosecute me, a lawyer for a few&#xD;
dollars obtained my discharge, and I was again at&#xD;
liberty. No victim of tyranny released from a twenty&#xD;
years' incarceration in the Bastile, could have felt more&#xD;
lonely and strange than I did in mingling again in the&#xD;
busy haunts of men. I knew not whither to turn my&#xD;
4eps. I was moneyless; Myndert was still abroad; and&#xD;
[ knew no one from whom I would ask assistance.&#xD;
Chance threw me in Chips the gambler's way, who&#xD;
insisted on my going to his house in Park Place, I took&#xD;
supper and slept there, but rather ashamed of having&#xD;
accepted the hospitality of men whom I had formerly&#xD;
looked upon with contempt, I left very early in the&#xD;
morning~to wander about the streets in a dejected, pur-&#xD;
po~ele~s way. I felt as if all that passed inc knew that&#xD;
the gaudy butterfly had become a worm. I was aware&#xD;
that sneers and malicious innuendos were rife about my&#xD;
downfall, and had heard that my former associates&#xD;
whose envy I had excited, punished me with jeering&#xD;
&#xD;
GAflRET VAN ~IORN.            561&#xD;
scorn, calling me a charlatan of fashion; a beggar on&#xD;
horseback, who had arrived at his destination; fool,&#xD;
swindler, and other similar epithets, whereby they&#xD;
revenged themselves on mc for having in my days of&#xD;
splendor betrayed them into snobbery and toadyisin.&#xD;
And yet I had a strong inclination to brazen contempt&#xD;
and flaunt, as it were, my misfortunes in their faces.&#xD;
It was Sunday, a bright, tranquil day. Assuming a&#xD;
smirking, jaunty air, while my heart was a lump of lead,&#xD;
I walked up Broadway to a fashionable church. On my&#xD;
way a kind4ooking man offered me a tract. I took it,&#xD;
without eagerness, yet with something of the feeling&#xD;
which induces a drowning man to catch at straws.&#xD;
Religion has comforted others-has enabled them to&#xD;
bear trials fav greater than mine, why should I not&#xD;
resort to it? And whilst thinking thus and reflecting&#xD;
on my wicked, ill-spent, selfish life, I arrived at the&#xD;
church. I hesitated now to enter, or rather, I could not&#xD;
enter in the vengeful mood that had impelled me there.&#xD;
Subdued in spirit, I took a retired seat. This house of&#xD;
worship was a gorgeous one. Religion had not only&#xD;
been petrified, but upholstered and painted as well.&#xD;
here was nothing consonant with tristful thoughts or&#xD;
aching hearts. In came the splendid congregation step-&#xD;
ping silently over the soft carpets, rustling silks, waving&#xD;
plumes, and filling the cushioned pews with youth and&#xD;
beauty, old age and decrepitude, innocence and vanity,&#xD;
benevolence and selfishness, virtue and vice. The organ&#xD;
pipes pealed forth their swelling harmony; the loud&#xD;
anthem and song of praise resounded beneath the&#xD;
groined roof, filing the heart with awe and gratitude,&#xD;
but I remained untouched. The minister was an elegant&#xD;

man. His hair was glossy, his teeth white, his hands&#xD;
snowy, in short, he only lacked intellect, lie was very&#xD;
effective in pressing at short intervals a cambric l)and-&#xD;
kerchief to his delicate lips, but his sermon was shallow&#xD;
and trite, and yet grave and reverend seig~ors sat&#xD;
beneath his teachings year after year.&#xD;
A cynical imp possessed me; I could not listen, and&#xD;
everything seemed but a mockery of devotion. The&#xD;
dandy, effeminate ecclesiastic in the pulpit dilating so&#xD;
unmeaningly on the vanity of riches was sedulously&#xD;
wooing the wealthiest ewe-lamb of his flock, whose only&#xD;
atti~action was her money. And the other performers,&#xD;
those in the organ-loft? The organist, a hebrew, is&#xD;
reading a newspaper, and the soprano, a pretty and&#xD;
clever actress from Niblo's, is peeping over the gallery&#xD;
at some young-men admirers who attend solely to hear&#xD;
her melodious warblings. See the audience, or rather&#xD;
the congregation, for but few are listeners, some old&#xD;
people tottering feebly towards the grave and anxious&#xD;
to propitiate the great Judge, and enthusiastic maidens&#xD;
who love the voice of the handsome preacher and unti-&#xD;
ringly admire his brow and hands, Cora Goldistone, for*&#xD;
instance, sitting yonder beside her brother Gansevoort,&#xD;
whose leaden eyes and jaded face tell of three o'clock&#xD;
in the morning at Pat Ilearn's, "passing buttons," and&#xD;
"fighting the tiger." In front of the pulpit sits promi..&#xD;
gently Mr. Kenatop, who read the responses from his big&#xD;
gilded book in such a profound and pompous way. lie is&#xD;
now continually nodding off to sleep and is as often&#xD;
nudged back to stupid surprise by the point of Mrs.&#xD;
Kemtop's parasol, until he keeps himself awake thinking&#xD;
of his dinner, and whether selling Erie "short," wouldn't&#xD;
&#xD;
362&#xD;
&#xD;
be a good spec. How much envy and covetousness is&#xD;
now wringing the heart of those sweet damsels and&#xD;
placid dames; and how much sloth and languor numbs&#xD;
the minds of their papas and lords? Are there any&#xD;
true worshippers here-~--any filed with earnest love of&#xD;
their Creator? Doubtless as sincere ones as ever gather-&#xD;
ed in a Puritan conventicle, and yet how few in com-&#xD;
parison with the host of Mammoii-worshippers and&#xD;
folly-worshippers, that fill this sanctuary. Aweary with&#xD;
such reflections, I read the tract given to me in the&#xD;
street. it reminded inc strongly of that story-book for&#xD;
children, entitled, "Little Margaret; or the Danger of&#xD;
playing with Fire." Its moral was as obvious and its&#xD;
logic as effectual, It told of a man who once a&#xD;
drunkard, swearer, Sabbath-breaker, and infidel, had&#xD;
been brought by the influence of religion from vice and&#xD;
indigence to wealth and respectability, concluding thus:&#xD;
"And now Thomas II- is mayor of his native city,&#xD;
owner of several warehouses, and an influential member&#xD;
of the church." And is this the reward of the followers&#xD;
of Jesus, wealth and warehouses? Are ease and com-&#xD;
fort and station, the baits to win souls to Christ? Is&#xD;
thrift indeed, as Shylock says, blessing? As I thus&#xD;
cogitated, a rising and fluttering of the assemblage&#xD;
reminded me that the service was at an end, and I&#xD;
brushed my way through the throng of resplendent&#xD;
sinners as the organ filled the sacred edifice with enll~&#xD;
evening strains from Meyerbeer's opera of Robert Ic&#xD;
Diable.&#xD;
The dandies, deeply impressed with the sermon they&#xD;
had heard, were clustered about the porch and vestibule,&#xD;
sucking their cane-tops, and reviewing the sallying&#xD;

belles. Here, in mogul-like importance comes Mr. Keim.&#xD;
top growling to his wife as he settles his fat chin in his&#xD;
stiff cravat, "Ver' fine discourse-ver' fine-um---um~"&#xD;
I slink aside to avoid recognition and hasten oft mutter-&#xD;
ing to myself, Away with such vanity and folly, such&#xD;
mockery of worship, insipid routine and spiritual bread-&#xD;
pills! Let me seek the contact of intellect and draw&#xD;
from its vigor, sustenance and tone for my disordered&#xD;
soul.&#xD;
I went to hear a celebrated preacher whose renown&#xD;
had reached every corner of the land; He was one of&#xD;
the lions of the town, and country visitors made it a&#xD;
point to attend his church as much as they did to go to&#xD;
High Bridge or the Museum. lie was a prominent&#xD;
advocate of many theories for the Advancement of&#xD;
Man, and styled himself a Philosopher and Seeker.&#xD;
Orthodox ministers, shocked at his heresies, denounced&#xD;
him as a deist-a pantheist-an infidel, and bade their&#xD;
flocks beware of him as a dangerous man.&#xD;
lie was, indeed, possessed of much intellect, earnest-&#xD;
ness, and eloquence. his rhetoric flowed like a majestic&#xD;
$tream, limpid, glittering, and resistless. All was beau-&#xD;
tiful and polished. Periods were rounded and the&#xD;
jewels of imagery used with the skill of a master. He&#xD;
bad studied in the Universities of Germany and delved&#xD;
assiduously in the mines of metaphysical lore. He had sat&#xD;
at the feet of Ilegel, Strauss, Fenerbach, and they had&#xD;
taught hiin-what? That they knew nothing and that he&#xD;
was as wise as they ~were. And still like the Danaides&#xD;
he plied his fruitless task, still whirled around an axis,&#xD;
or like the imprisoned bird beat himself against the&#xD;
bars. The crowded and critical assemblage hung&#xD;
&#xD;
delighted on his words; they admired the construction&#xD;
of his lecture; they were as guests at a grand repast&#xD;
and he fed them with luscious fruits and delicious cates,&#xD;
but no congeniality of soul cemented them, and each&#xD;
J)ursued his thoughts and purposes as best beseemed&#xD;
tim, looking to the preacher not as a teacher but rather&#xD;
as an aspirant to his applause. Oscillating from doubt&#xD;
to doubt, the orator~ lacked the vitality of faith, and&#xD;
never soared to those enipyrean heights from which&#xD;
the inspired divine hurls thunderbolts at cowering Evil,&#xD;
or with lips touched with hallowed fire softens the heart&#xD;
of flint.&#xD;
how could such a man, a seeker himself, supply the&#xD;
wants of a hungry craving soul? Let me leave, I&#xD;
exclaimed, these amateur devotees, this school of&#xD;
Eclectics. Let me seek among the lowly, among those&#xD;
of simple faith and uncorrupted by riches, the stan-&#xD;
chion to uphold me from the abyss ~f doubt and&#xD;
despair!&#xD;
I went to a chapel in B- Street.. It was a small,&#xD;
plain, wooden building, from which any thing resembling&#xD;
the cruciform in its construction had been carefully&#xD;
avoided. Here worshipped a congregation of Came-&#xD;
ronians, mostly Scots or people from the north of ireland,&#xD;
stern, bony-featured folks they were, in sad-colored&#xD;
clothes and looking as if their rigid faith had petrified&#xD;
them. Ilon6st men these and self-denying, save in&#xD;
regard to whiskey and money-hoarding, and true as&#xD;
steel to their creed, ready if it need be to walk to the&#xD;
stake singing psalms or with ja~v set to "trust in the&#xD;
Lord and charge with your lances," like the Ironsides&#xD;
of old Nell.&#xD;

Here were no raiments of purple and fine linen, no&#xD;
stained glass and gaudy trappings, no organ (for as one&#xD;
of them expressed it, they did not believe in worship-&#xD;
ping God with a "box of whistles"), no honied homilies,&#xD;
or eloquent lecture. The preacher disdained the beauti-&#xD;
ful and employed not the flowers of oratory. lie meant&#xD;
to be a true soldier of the cross, and no trifler or carpet-&#xD;
knight. In appearance he might have sat for the pic-&#xD;
ture of a Grand Inquisitor. Wiry and wasted, the&#xD;
light of zeal and intolerance burned in his cavernous&#xD;
eyes. His harsh lineanients, square chin, and thin lips,&#xD;
all told of his uncompromising, inexorable faith and&#xD;
determination to battle to the last against any and all&#xD;
the opposing powers. On this particular occasion he&#xD;
tilted at the Pope. And how fiercely he attacked that&#xD;
triple-crowned potentate! Tooth and nail, mauling&#xD;
him, battering him, and banging his rusty keys about&#xD;
his venerable pow until the poor old successor of St.&#xD;
Peter cannot possibly have recovered from it to this&#xD;
very day. He exhibited the enormities of the lady in&#xD;
scarlet in a lurid light, lie told us all about the Inqui-&#xD;
sition, the Auto-da-f4s, the massacre of St. Bartholomew,&#xD;
in such a scathing, demolishing way that, figuratively&#xD;
speaking, he left not one stone of the Church of Rome&#xD;
upon the other. And what did he prove? That wicked&#xD;
bigots had been recreant to their creed, not that their&#xD;
creed was an erroneous one, for whilst he was repeating&#xD;
those stale stories of fanatical cruelty, and denouncing&#xD;
the abhorred church as idolatrous, I bethought me ol&#xD;
the gentle Sisters who had watched by my bedside and&#xD;
coQled my ~ngi~ish-wrung brow when I lay burning with&#xD;
fever on the hospitaL bed in Algiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
Of what use was such a sermon? There was proba-&#xD;
bly not one Roman Catholic present. I came not to&#xD;
hear of the errors of other faiths, but to discover the&#xD;
virtues and seek relief from his own; and he tendered&#xD;
me instead the bitterness and anger of dialectics.. He&#xD;
sowed salt, and was killing every germ of repentance in&#xD;
my heart. I turned away in disgust. All-all is hol-&#xD;
lowness! forms, cant, or bigotry!&#xD;
There was no voice to bid me hope and simply whis-&#xD;
per: Seek not thy God through the mediation of man.&#xD;
Beseech his love and it shall be given to thee. His&#xD;
word is open, read, pray, and the scales will fall fi~om&#xD;
thy blinded eyes. Contrition can cleanse the blackest&#xD;
sinner even as the leper touched by Jesus. God's grace&#xD;
is universal, and restricted not by the formulas of man.&#xD;
Some one tapped me on the shoulder as I was leaving&#xD;
the chapel. I turned; it was old Cluny the gardener.&#xD;
My heart beat at the thoughts his presence brought to&#xD;
my mind.&#xD;
"I ower glad to see ye in this path," he said.&#xD;
"Thank you, Cluny, thank you. How is" (I hesi-&#xD;
tated), "Mr. home ?"&#xD;
"Mr. home-ha' ye na heard the sad news&#xD;
"Sad news! Cluny, what sad news ?"&#xD;
"Ha' ye na heard aboot Miss Lesby ?"&#xD;
"About Miss Lesbia! Why man, what mean you ?"&#xD;
"Ah, sir," said the old man shaking his head, "what&#xD;

masquerading, na gude ever cam' fra sic dcii's wark."&#xD;
"But what is it-what is it ?" cried I, impatiently.&#xD;

Lesbia Home eloped with that extraordinary scamp,&#xD;
Doctor Rose! I cannot describe my amazement, when&#xD;
the old gardener told me that. By dint of questioning&#xD;
I extracted the following particulars of the affair from&#xD;
him. It had occurred some~ three months previous.&#xD;
Doctor Rose, after having placed his wife in the lunatic&#xD;
asylum, gradually turned all the property he held in&#xD;
trust for her into ready money, and departed in a steam-&#xD;
ship for Europe. Lesbian accompanied him. The infatu-&#xD;
ated gii'l left a note addressed to her father, begging his&#xD;
forgiveness and stating, in extenuation of her conduct,&#xD;
that she had so long and ardently loved the Doctor that&#xD;
life without him was valueless. He would soon get a&#xD;
divorce from his mad wife, and aware that she could not&#xD;
obtain her father's consent to such a marriage had&#xD;
taken a venturesome step in the hope that time and&#xD;
absence would mollify his anger, and enable her to return&#xD;
home the happy bride of her dear Edniund, and obtain&#xD;
her father's pardon, etc. etc.&#xD;

The stroke was an overwhelming one to Mr. home.&#xD;
From frantic rage he fell to whimpering grief, and one&#xD;
long, long night of agony, laid the weight of twenty&#xD;
years on his gray head, and left him a haggard, misera-&#xD;

come from an only child and etted daughter! And&#xD;
moans and lamentations gay ace to execrations and a&#xD;
thirst for revenge.&#xD;
having ascertained that the fugitives had sailed for&#xD;

followed immediately in pursuit, to seek the despoiler&#xD;
and slay him ~vith vengeful joy. 0, how I seconded his&#xD;

day of brilliance hid ~ and now caine&#xD;
ight-gloorny, melancholy nio~ht?&#xD;
My ill-spent, foolish life had borne its fi'uit, and I was&#xD;
left with crushed spirits, impaired health, and only&#xD;
energy enough to curse my birth. Like a rudderless&#xD;
ship, I yawed with distracted mind from one purpose to&#xD;
another, until I sank into torpidity and reached that&#xD;
pitiable stage of ruined man when retrospection and&#xD;
reflection become a torture. When the pbor wretch&#xD;
cannot repent, for he dares not undergo the fearful&#xD;
oi'deal of thought-.-and without burning, searing, scar-&#xD;
ring thought, there can be no reformation. I fell into the&#xD;
mire of degradation, into that lethal ooze where the&#xD;
spiritless, enervated man, feels but tl~e promptings of&#xD;
his appetites and craves only those potent liquids, either&#xD;
sedatives or stimulants, whose properties can extinguish&#xD;

&#xD;
any rising pang and afford but one moment of peace&#xD;
and gratification. With a fearful facility I yielded to the&#xD;
influence of alcohol, and was in dull anguish until its&#xD;
subtle, nimble fire interfused my shattered system. I&#xD;
sank to a perilous point; so far as to herd with the&#xD;
vilest of the vile and to accept liquor from the lowest.&#xD;

To such a depth had I fallen when, thank God! a&#xD;
brother's grasp drew me from the slough and saved&#xD;
me.&#xD;
During this time of my abasement, I still preserved&#xD;
enough of self-respect to slink away from the kicks of&#xD;
a cold selfish world, and hide me from familiar eyes.&#xD;
~ either relatives nor acquaintances knew what had&#xD;
become of me. In particular, I carefully shunned Myn-&#xD;
dert, who had returned from Europe to find himself&#xD;
ruined in fortune through the dishonesty of an agent. I&#xD;
feared to meet the man whose fraternal love I had&#xD;
repaid, during my short-lived magnificence, by total&#xD;
neglect. Fortunately, chance threw us together for I&#xD;
would have died rather than voluntarily seek him.&#xD;
My haunts were Catherine Market and its vicinity,&#xD;
and I subsisted on the few shillings earned as helper to&#xD;
the market-men, which pittance was chiefly expended in&#xD;
buying the vile witch-broth sold at the neighboring&#xD;
dram-shops.&#xD;
One hot summer afternoon, overcome by the stupor&#xD;
of inebriety, I lay on a vacant stall to sleep when some&#xD;
vagrant boys began pelting me with potatoes a~jid cab.&#xD;
bage-stalks. Enraged at this, I ran into the street to&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;

give them chase. The young ragamuffins surrounded me,&#xD;
yelling and hooting, pulling me by the coattails hither&#xD;
and thither, while I staggered and fell in drunken efforts&#xD;
to seize my tormentors. At this moment, a gentleman&#xD;
who was driving byin a gig pulled up to observe the scene.&#xD;
Suddenly he sprang out, caught me by the arm, and&#xD;
lifted me like a child into his vehicle. Something like a&#xD;
groan escaped him as he resumed his seat, and giving&#xD;
his horse a sharp cut he drove rapidly away as the crowd&#xD;
of boys, balked of their liutt, raised a shout of derision.&#xD;
I looked at my rescuer for some moments in a hebetated&#xD;
way, until, getting a faint idea of who he was, I fell&#xD;
asleep.&#xD;
The next morning I awoke in Myndert's mould-loft,&#xD;
and found myself lying in a hammock which he kept&#xD;
for his occasional use. My knowledge of what had&#xD;
occurred was rather confused, but I was full of joy at,&#xD;
having been discovered by my brother; yet I dreaded&#xD;
meeting him, and could have taken to my heels when I&#xD;
heard' his footstep near. It was very early when ho&#xD;
came, but little after daybreak, and no workmen had&#xD;
arrived. He found me sluggish and feeble, and throw.&#xD;
ing me some clothes he had brought he pointed to&#xD;
a bucket of water, bade me cleanse myself, and cast&#xD;
away the filthy garments I had on. I obeyed him in&#xD;
silence, and after I had undergone a thorough ablu-&#xD;
tion and was attired in the clean linen and decent&#xD;
apparel, he put some brandy in a tumbler and held it to&#xD;
my lips. "Drink it 1" he commanded as I hesitated, for&#xD;
I feared he meant to moek me. "Drink it! you've&#xD;
tasted it before."&#xD;
He was harsh and I preferred it. I could not have&#xD;
&#xD;
withstood kind words from him at that moment. After&#xD;
drinking the liquor, I felt braced and better able to con-&#xD;
front his anger,. and he spared me not. "That's the&#xD;
last-mind you.-the very last dram you shall. ever&#xD;
drink Mind what I say. I've set you up ~o knock you&#xD;
down. Touch it again and I'll drown you I I'll have&#xD;
no drunken sot for a brother, my father's son shall not&#xD;
wallow like a hog while I live. Our blood don't breed&#xD;
paupers and beggars-the Van Horns are . men, not&#xD;
swine! Brandy and wine are for men-men with self-&#xD;
resp6ct and will, and not for such weak-marrowless----&#xD;
despicable-idiotic wretches as you are !" In this strain&#xD;
he continued, lashing me severely and pitilessly, and&#xD;
his invective cut me like a wired thong. The first blows&#xD;
struck out some sparks of latent pride, but as the&#xD;
strokes were redoubled, I winced like a whipped hound.&#xD;
I could bear it no longer and turning away, my eyes&#xD;
moistened, and I covered my face in shame as his tor-&#xD;
rent of vehement reproach and sarcasm fell and crushed&#xD;
me.&#xD;
He ceased abruptly, and bade me follow him. I went&#xD;
like a cowed child. lIe set me to work in the yard at a&#xD;
simple task, and. from that moment hewatched me like a&#xD;
jailer. I was beneath his eye almost continually, lie&#xD;
took me with him in his .gig when attending to his&#xD;
business in the lower part of the city, and we occupied&#xD;
the same sleeping apartment at night. The first week&#xD;
or two, I suffered all that remorse and bitter reflection&#xD;
could inflict on an unstrung and abused man. But&#xD;
Myndert'was a. skilful physician, and his wrath proved&#xD;
an excellent tonic. In a month there was a great&#xD;
improvement in my mental and physical condition;&#xD;

&#xD;
Myndert had become kinder to me, still his. vigilance&#xD;
was not relaxed. I was advanced to more laborious&#xD;
tasks and enrolled among the other artisans, keeping the&#xD;
same hours, and receiving the pay 'of an apprentice.&#xD;
Under this energetic treatment, and what with lugging&#xD;
and lifting timber, turning the grindstone, and swing-&#xD;
ing the maul, my flaccid muscles toughened, my slack&#xD;
nerves recovered their tension, I regained energy and a&#xD;
clear brain, I was saved from a woful death, and all by&#xD;
a brother's unfaltering love and devotion.&#xD;
In house :No. - Avenue A, second story front, com-&#xD;
manding a fine view of Tompkins Square, I am sitting.&#xD;
I have just finished the three hundred and odd pages&#xD;
of lucubrations which the reader, if he have followed&#xD;
me thus far, has perused. It. is I 1~1. x'.~x., August 20th,&#xD;
1 86-. My brother Myndert is sleeping in the bed&#xD;
beside me, calm and peaceful as a child. The room is&#xD;
scantily furnished and books occupy a larger space in it&#xD;
Lhan anything else. We might have finer quarters, cer-&#xD;
tainly, but Myndert, you know, is an honest fellow and&#xD;
as he is working with other people's money, he is as&#xD;
careful of it as if it were his own. His scheme of a&#xD;
Mutual-benefit Industrial Association fell through, as I&#xD;
told you, owing to the rascality of the man whom he&#xD;
had trusted the most; and now he is working hard to&#xD;
retrieve lQst time and fortune.. I am his journeyman and&#xD;
can handle the adze and drive the plane with the best&#xD;
wright iii the yard. I am no longer a drone, but by&#xD;
&amp;amp;duo~e, honorable toil, earn .my food and eat it with a&#xD;
&#xD;
875&#xD;
relish unknown to the indolent gastronomer. I sleep&#xD;
soundly from eve till morn, and have re-obtained a price-&#xD;
less elasticity of spirits. I have learnt to subdue con-&#xD;
ceit, false pride, and envy, and to practise self-denial. I&#xD;
am endeavoring, and may God assist me, t~ lustrate my&#xD;
heart, to uproot therefrom every evil, noisome weed, and&#xD;
to cultivate humility and virtue.&#xD;
Thus have I become a philosopher, a philosopher&#xD;
among the chips; and for the first time in my life do I&#xD;
feel that serenity of mind Which springs from content-&#xD;
ment. My lot is a humble one; my earnings are small,&#xD;
yet large enough to supply the wants of a bachelor and&#xD;
enable him to lay aside for impotent age.&#xD;
Xow I am. as happy as a mortal may be. I enjoy&#xD;
books, nature, and toil. I have a few friends and a&#xD;
brother whose affection I have proven ten-fold; I have&#xD;
health and reason, what more could I have?&#xD;
What, it may be asked, has become of the other&#xD;
actors in this eventful comedy? How can I tell?&#xD;
What do we know of the fate of the many companions&#xD;
that have walked beside us for a longer or shorter dis-&#xD;
tance on the way of life? Some have fallen by the&#xD;
road-side, and others have separated to follow different&#xD;
paths. Vague news reaches us at times of the fortune&#xD;
or misfortune of this one or that one, until we forget them&#xD;
and they forget us, One only have I anxiously sought to&#xD;
know of and more anxiously sought to thrust away that&#xD;
knowledge, from my mind, when obtained. She was in&#xD;
Paris, I learnt. Her father had traced her thither, but&#xD;
the encounter between them had proved too much for his&#xD;
s6rrow-weakened frame, and he fell dead in her presence&#xD;
from an apoplectic stroke. Horror-stricken at this, the&#xD;

&#xD;
unfortunate girl plunged madly into, the vortex ol&#xD;
Parisian folly and dissipation to drown distracting&#xD;
thought; and now, any day', may be seen on the great&#xD;
avenue of the Champs Elys6es a sumptuous equipage,&#xD;
with livened lac&#xD;
well-known    queys, on whose satin ,cushions bus a&#xD;
queen of the Jemi-moncle, who is none other&#xD;
than the once innocent and happy Lesbia Home.&#xD;
Imay add, in conclusion, that my unfortunate aunt&#xD;
Jane has been released by merciful death from all her&#xD;
earthly troubles;' and that her niece Laura, my quondam&#xD;
fiame,~ is now the happy wife of Eugene Kemtop. his&#xD;
mother, they say, engineered the match, and so secured&#xD;
a good and wealthy spouse for her son. The young&#xD;
couple live in great style and are reckoned among the&#xD;
cream of our best society. I met her by accident not&#xD;
long since, and in a way to test the disposition of a. fine&#xD;
lady. She and her husband were in their carriage at&#xD;
one of the Brooklyn ferries awaiting to cross the river.&#xD;
ii happened, just then, to be employed on a ship close by&#xD;
that needed repairs. Laura saw me, and I ~vent imme-                           (&#xD;
diately to shake hauds with her. To be sure, I was in&#xD;
my working clothes with my coat oft' and shirt-sleeves&#xD;
rolled up, but this did not dampen her greeting in the&#xD;
least. Her husband, I noticed, reddened and looked&#xD;
somewhat dumb-founded at my audacity, but Laura&#xD;
was as cordial as possible; invited me to come and see&#xD;
them; and kept me talking until Eugene got impatient.&#xD;
Bless her for a true-hearted woman! there's nothing of&#xD;
the snob in her, at all events.&#xD;
And now, reader; kind, fair, good, or gentle, as the&#xD;
case may be, Farewell!&#xD;
TUE END,&#xD;
