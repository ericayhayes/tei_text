2                         THE PRIZE ESSAY.&#xD;
&#xD;
TILE PRIZE ESSAY.&#xD;
&#xD;
Well, good-bye, may the muses attend you, and-&#xD;
yes, I might as well wish you success !" and with&#xD;
this Gary Putnam dashed away to join his com-&#xD;
panions,with all of whom he was much ofafavorite&#xD;
This youth was now in his eighteenth year,&#xD;
and through all his life he had seemed Fortune's&#xD;
pet child. The son of a wealthy city Judge, in&#xD;
his infancy and boyhood he had basked in the&#xD;
sunshine of a delightful home, and the object of&#xD;
a doting mother and sister's love;and his father's&#xD;
pride, scarcely a wished for pleasure had been de-&#xD;
nied him. Possessing fine mental powers by nature,&#xD;
each day of his, life had served to foster within&#xD;
his heart a self-superiority, and consequently a&#xD;
depreciation of almost every one he might come&#xD;
in contact with. Very early he learned to hold&#xD;
all mental, as well as physical labor, in contempt.&#xD;
Why should he not? all praised and petted him-&#xD;
teachers held him up as an example, and -friends&#xD;
called him a child of genius. Since he, without&#xD;
an half hour's labor, would far excel those who&#xD;
had toiled for long hours to accomplish the same&#xD;
thing-could win praises and prizes till they had&#xD;
no value. Where was the necessity of his doing&#xD;
more ? Happily he possessed a good share of&#xD;
heart-kindness-a great deal of good nature and&#xD;
tact-so was not more a favorite at home than in&#xD;
the country academy, where he was placed for a&#xD;
thorough preparation for college. Before the first&#xD;
six months came to an end, nearly every one,&#xD;
teachers not excepted, paid court to this young&#xD;
man's genius-perchance a small share of the&#xD;
attention which was heaped upon him might have&#xD;
been owing to his father's wealth. Be.that as it&#xD;
may, his stay in this country school had been&#xD;
very delightful to him-the two years had been&#xD;
years of triumph, which would have filled almost&#xD;
any young head with pride. Surely it was not&#xD;
strange that he smiled half derisively at the idea&#xD;
of the less fortunate, and, as he believed, less&#xD;
gifted Richard Sumner entering the lists against&#xD;
him in composition-the study of all others in&#xD;
which he took pride in success. And now one&#xD;
glance at young Sumner's past and present.&#xD;
Like his school-fellow, he was an only son, the&#xD;
object of the love and pride of his parents and&#xD;
two younger sisters. But his father, a tolerable&#xD;
thrifty farmer, had scraped together his little all&#xD;
by dint of hard labor, and when his son first ex.&#xD;
pressed adesire for a better education than could&#xD;
be procured at their district school-which, after&#xD;
he was ten years of age, he could attend for but&#xD;
three months in the year, he having become far&#xD;
too useful to be spared from the farm, save du-&#xD;
ring the depth of winter-old Mr. Sumner thought&#xD;
the boy a little out of his mind. It was, however,&#xD;
&#xD;
talked over again and again by the two, some-&#xD;
times Mrs. Sumner and her two daughters, Mary&#xD;
and Janet, being present. Whenever they were,&#xD;
the fond girls, though tooyoungto speak with dis-&#xD;
cretion-had their little word in favor of their&#xD;
brother's plans, and although Mrs. Sumner was&#xD;
too exemplary a wife to take a position against&#xD;
her husband, yet she could not help smiling upon&#xD;
her children with pride, so willing as they were&#xD;
to sacrifice to each other. These young sisters&#xD;
proposing the yielding of some promised pleasure&#xD;
that their brother should be gratified, and he as&#xD;
firmly refusing to, accept such a sacrifice from&#xD;
them. The end was, the father yielded to the&#xD;
reasonings of his son, although he would persist&#xD;
in pronouncing it all folly for a farmer's boy to&#xD;
have a better education than could be acquired in&#xD;
their own little district school house.&#xD;
One year Richard should spend in the academy,&#xD;
situated about a dozen miles from his home-but&#xD;
this could not be an unbroken year. The first of&#xD;
November-it would be his nineteenth birthday,&#xD;
in prospect such a happy one-he was to com-&#xD;
mence, to remain, save the week of holidays, six&#xD;
months without interruption. Then he must&#xD;
come home to help his father through with the&#xD;
farm work until the following November, when&#xD;
he should re-enter school to complete his year.&#xD;
And that home-was it not a busy one ! Never&#xD;
did mother's and sisters' fingers work more in-&#xD;
dustriously or more willingly to prepare a darling&#xD;
son and brother for his first going away from that&#xD;
dear fireside ; and all their niceness and'industry&#xD;
were necessary to make their Richard's home-&#xD;
spun clothing passable among the more -highly&#xD;
favored sons and daughters with whom he was&#xD;
to mingle. He was a fine youth, and when Mrs.&#xD;
Sumner and the girls saw him ready to take his&#xD;
departure, in the simplicity of their loving hearts&#xD;
they wondered if he would not be the pride of&#xD;
the academy, as he was of their home. The&#xD;
" good-byes'  were happy, smiling ones, for&#xD;
economy required that the boy should board him-&#xD;
self, so he would come home every week to re-&#xD;
new his stock of provisions ; and every Saturday&#xD;
afternoon it would be so delightful to have him&#xD;
come as a visitor-better than having him all the&#xD;
time, the girls said to their mother, in whose lov-&#xD;
ing eyes the tears would glisten. Even the noble&#xD;
hearted old father caught something of their en-&#xD;
thusiasm, and rubbed his horny hands with a good&#xD;
relish at the thought of the splendid times they&#xD;
would have every Saturday night listening to all&#xD;
Dick would have to tell them, and in their turn&#xD;
relating all the haps and mishaps connected with&#xD;
kitchen and barn yard.&#xD;
&#xD;
This young man's entry into what must of&#xD;
course be so new to him, was attended by many&#xD;
trials. Diffident to a painful degree-for many&#xD;
days he shrank and trembled at the very sound&#xD;
of his own voice. There were a few, as there&#xD;
ever are in such a country seminary, who made a&#xD;
jest of his embarrassment, yet nearly all had for&#xD;
him a kind werd, and very soon he gained courage&#xD;
to show what he really was, and before a month&#xD;
passed he found a footing among schoolfellows&#xD;
and teachers not at all despicable. His educa-&#xD;
tion, though home gained, had not been neglected,&#xD;
and by his untiring industry this farmer boy kept&#xD;
his ?lace nobly with those who had spent months&#xD;
where he had days in the school. And the gay,&#xD;
dashing Gary Putnam, who thought Dick Sum-&#xD;
ner one of the finest fellows he had ever seen, was&#xD;
filled with delight at his unequalled success,&#xD;
though he did shrug his shoulders in a half com-&#xD;
miserating way at such untiring labor.&#xD;
Sumner's first six months had come very near&#xD;
to its close-it had been a delightful time, and&#xD;
the last three weeks, which were spent in re-&#xD;
viewing everything in preparation for the exhibi-&#xD;
tion which was to terminate the winter and&#xD;
spring term, gave this youth little time for pleas-&#xD;
ure or sleep, so anxious was he for the result,&#xD;
and so determined that his parents and sisters,&#xD;
who were to be there, should be made happy by.&#xD;
seeing him hold a fair position among the stu-&#xD;
dents. He belonged to the first rhetoric class, in&#xD;
which the Professor took great pride. To the&#xD;
member who should write the best essay there&#xD;
was to be given a prize, yet to make a trial for it&#xD;
was not compulsory, but rested with the choice&#xD;
of the pupils. Gary Putnam prided himself&#xD;
more upon his position in this class than in any&#xD;
other, and so successful had he been in winning&#xD;
the prize each term, it had frightened nearly all&#xD;
his fellows from the field as competitors ; but&#xD;
Richard Sumner resolved that this time he&#xD;
should have a determined rival, if not a success-&#xD;
ful one, yet crowded as he found every moment,&#xD;
sometimes it had seemed almost impossible to de-&#xD;
vote one hour to what should have had aleast a&#xD;
whole day.&#xD;
A fortnight before the close of the term, when&#xD;
at home to make his weekly visit, he was telling&#xD;
his sister Mary-who was now fifteen-of his&#xD;
fear that he should have no time to spend in this&#xD;
little strife. Sister-like she was confident it but&#xD;
required her darling brother's best effort to make&#xD;
sure of the victory, for had he not already re-&#xD;
ceived the highest praise-and deservedly too-&#xD;
for the beautiful things he had written. That his&#xD;
friend, young Putnam, whose praises he was nev-&#xD;
&#xD;
er tired of sounding, could do well she was ready&#xD;
to admit, but not better than her brother, and her&#xD;
proposal that they should all forego the pleasure&#xD;
of their visit for two weeks to come, was seized&#xD;
upon by Richard with great eagerness.&#xD;
"After that we'll have you every day for six&#xD;
months, brother Dick, so we shall -none of&#xD;
us mind it so very much-poor little Janet will&#xD;
take on the worst, for you have no idea how she&#xD;
misses you; all the week she counts the days to&#xD;
Saturday, then as as soon as that day, which is a&#xD;
v ary bright day to all of us, comes, she counts the&#xD;
hours till your time of arriving ; but don't yield&#xD;
to the little rogue, for we shall be so proud to&#xD;
hear your name called out on that night. I am&#xD;
sure we shall be well paid for not seeing you all&#xD;
these two weeks."&#xD;
And so it was decided, not, however, without&#xD;
some opposition from the younger sister, as well&#xD;
as the father, that Saturday of the two following&#xD;
weeks should be spent by this ambitious youth in&#xD;
making himself ready, for what, to all of them,&#xD;
was a very great event.&#xD;
By nearly all the students Saturday was passed&#xD;
as a holyday, and when young Putnam had heard&#xD;
that his friend, sumner, had not gone home, as&#xD;
was his custom, lie determined to secure him as&#xD;
one of a party he was getting up for a day in the&#xD;
woods. But as has been seen, Dick Sumner had&#xD;
something more important on hand, and his young&#xD;
friend was not altogether satisfied at discovering&#xD;
the same. He was very partial to him, but no,&#xD;
he could not feel willing to yield the pamhn to him&#xD;
in this department.&#xD;
"If he had chosen to rival me in anything elfn,"&#xD;
soliloquised Putnam, as he went out, "I would mot&#xD;
mind it-I wouldn't try very hard, for I like his&#xD;
spirit, but in this 1 must keep imy place " but lie&#xD;
had no thought of the wound lie had given that&#xD;
friend's spirit by the tone of superiority he had&#xD;
assumed. Habit had taught him to consider this&#xD;
his right, and nearly all acknowledged it so, by&#xD;
countenancing what, in another one, they would&#xD;
have set down to impertinence.&#xD;
Sumner and Putnam    were the same good&#xD;
friends as ever after this slight difference, anil&#xD;
may be the former would have felt a small sitisfe-&#xD;
tion, could he have known his confident rival&#xD;
had taken another reading of his own essay -&#xD;
making  some changes and amendments. At&#xD;
length the examination, which was to last two&#xD;
days, commenced, and as usual, progressed finely.&#xD;
This was not only an academy for young men, but&#xD;
for young ladies as well, and in that examina-&#xD;
tion there was manifest the spirit and vigor&#xD;
which is found inl no inistitutioni devoted to&#xD;

&#xD;
either sex exclusively. Not until the last even-&#xD;
ing were to come the reading and speaking,&#xD;
the evening of the closing exhibition, and by&#xD;
all this was looked forward to with great&#xD;
anxiety, for not until then would they know who&#xD;
was counted first in any of the classes, nor who&#xD;
was successful in the prize essay-and never had&#xD;
Gary Putnam felt as much excitement in such&#xD;
matter as he did now. As to Richard Sumner,&#xD;
everything was new and exciting, to everything&#xD;
he gave a share-of thought and anxiety, and not&#xD;
after his essay had gone out of his hands, until on&#xD;
this last evening, as he sat in his place among&#xD;
his fellows, and occasionally caught a glimpse of&#xD;
one or more of the eager fond faces of his own&#xD;
family, did he feel any peculiar heart-throbbings&#xD;
for the coming declaration as to who was the&#xD;
winner. They would feel it so much if he had&#xD;
failed in this-yet he had scarcely a hope of any-&#xD;
thing else. The kind-Sumner almost fancied&#xD;
congratulatory-smile of the preceptress, who,&#xD;
with the professor, and one other teacher, were&#xD;
the judges in all the matters-thepeculiar smile&#xD;
of this lady-like matronly woman, as she passed&#xD;
him to take her place among the teachers, made&#xD;
the young man's heart bound with hope ; "She&#xD;
would not have smiled in that way upon me was&#xD;
I the loser in what I have striven for with all may&#xD;
strength, she is so kind;"lhe said this mentally,but a&#xD;
moment after, the thought " she is accustomed to&#xD;
such things, and could have no idea how I, a fool&#xD;
ish boy, would interpret a kindly glance-no, I&#xD;
wont flatter myself;" and it would have been&#xD;
well for him, had he prevailed upon his ex-&#xD;
pectant heart to yield up all his hopes, for a&#xD;
moment after, the reader coming upon the stage,&#xD;
the prize essay was announced, and the first word&#xD;
consigned all his cherished hopes to the grave.'It&#xD;
was very hard to endure, yet the young marn&#xD;
was far toy proud to allow those around him to&#xD;
see his disappointment, and bravely he returned&#xD;
a congratulatory smile for the triumphant one his&#xD;
friend Putnam threw upon him. Richard Sum-&#xD;
ner held his teachers in too high a respect to think&#xD;
of anything like injustice, yet he knew his partial&#xD;
dear ones could not see this in the same light he&#xD;
could, and try as he would, he could not gain cour-&#xD;
age to glance at those sadly disappointed faces.&#xD;
He knew their expectations had been very high,&#xD;
and he feared his sister Mary would consider his&#xD;
success in everything else as nothing, that he had&#xD;
failed in this. While these thoughts were flitting&#xD;
through his mind, he was listening to the reading&#xD;
of his rival's production, And before it was half&#xD;
done, he was more than satisfied that the choiceI&#xD;
had been made with justice-it was a brilliant&#xD;
&#xD;
composition, displaying much genius, and he felt&#xD;
no jealousy when Gary Putnam was:announced&#xD;
the recipient of the prize.&#xD;
" But," the Professor went on to say, " this is&#xD;
not the only; rival essay which deserves a hear-&#xD;
ing-there is another scarcely inferior-not in-&#xD;
ferior in excellency-but the writer has failed to&#xD;
round his sentences as perfectly as in that just&#xD;
read: as this is a thing to be acquired by prac-&#xD;
tice'only, it could hardly be pronounced a fault;&#xD;
yet it must have its consideration, and it has turn-&#xD;
ed the scales in favor of Mr. Patnam, although one&#xD;
of the three, whose difficult task it was to decide,&#xD;
still persists in holding to the rejected, but most&#xD;
praiseworthy essay as the one deserving the prize.&#xD;
All shall hear it," he said, and taking his seat,&#xD;
the reader came forward, and commenced in a&#xD;
clear tone-yes, he was not mistaken-these were&#xD;
his own carefully studied reflections.&#xD;
Richard's disappointment had not been half as&#xD;
difficult to endure as was this joy; for a few mo-&#xD;
nients ho heard nothing save the hum of the read-&#xD;
er's voice, saw nothing but that radiant face-&#xD;
his sister Mary's face. His parents and little&#xD;
Janet might still be in doubt, they had not lost all&#xD;
of their expression of disappointment, though now&#xD;
there was mingled with it much of hope, but his&#xD;
eldest sister, extacy beamed from every feature.&#xD;
That of itself would have rewarded the fond&#xD;
brother for nights of toil and many days of pleas-&#xD;
ure sacrificed to study. In the midst of his be-&#xD;
wilderment he heard his own name called out,&#xD;
and immediately followed such a clapping of&#xD;
hands and stamping of feet as quite recalled his&#xD;
wandering senses.&#xD;
When order was partially restored the Profes-&#xD;
sor called upon Gary Putnam to come forward and&#xD;
receive his well earned prize; but before the&#xD;
words had escaped his lips there arose such a tu-&#xD;
mult among the audience-such a renewed clap.&#xD;
ping of hands and calling for Richard Sumner ; in&#xD;
a moment the students caught the enthusiasm,&#xD;
and " Dick Sumner, Dick Sumner, too," was&#xD;
echoed by a hundred voices, and the good, warm-&#xD;
hearted Professor finding there was but one way&#xD;
of quelling the tumult, left the stage, and a mo-&#xD;
ment after returned followed by the rival friends,&#xD;
Sumner and Putnam,arm in arm. Their appear-&#xD;
ance called for renewed cheers, and when order&#xD;
was once more restored, with a brief preamble&#xD;
the good Professor made a presentation of the&#xD;
prize-a beautifully bound volume ofShakspeare-&#xD;
to the triumphant Putnam. He feared another&#xD;
interruption before he should bethrough, so made&#xD;
all possible haste ; but every voice was silent, no&#xD;
&#xD;

THE PRIZE ESSAY.&#xD;
&#xD;
draught at that fountain from which he had sipped&#xD;
a few drops, and found them so delicious; but&#xD;
it could not be. He must be satisfied, for he was&#xD;
confident his father had done all for him he could&#xD;
afford, and he would show him that-he knew how&#xD;
to be grateful. With a right good will he bade&#xD;
adieu to his teachers and fellow-students, and re-&#xD;
solved to leave all regrets behind him. It was&#xD;
not his fortune to have such coveted advantages&#xD;
as many he had come to know, during his year in&#xD;
school, but he felt he had richer blessings, per-&#xD;
haps, than they in that plain old farm-house, his&#xD;
home, and he returned to them with a loving,&#xD;
thankful heart.&#xD;
This time, the termclosed on Friday night, and&#xD;
the following Monday morning Dick Sumner ap-&#xD;
peared in his rough farming garb, ready to do&#xD;
battle with the spring's work, which was already&#xD;
waiting to be attacked by his young strong arms.&#xD;
That night the good old farmer whispered to his&#xD;
smiling wife that their boy was made of the right&#xD;
stuff ; "he can't be puffed up or spilt by all the&#xD;
larnin' in the land ;" and when, in the following&#xD;
fall, his manly son procured a situation as teach-&#xD;
er of a school, and was to receive the almost fabu-&#xD;
lous sum of twenty dollars a month, board and&#xD;
wsAshing included, and his school to continue five&#xD;
months, was not the father proud enough?&#xD;
" Ah, my boy, we'll be thinkin' 'bout a new&#xD;
houie one of these days," he exclaimed, carefully&#xD;
reckoning up what amount of money Dick would&#xD;
be the possessor of in the Spring; "Mother says&#xD;
this old un is gettin' purty rickety, and so it is,&#xD;
I 'spose, but it's somethin like oursel's; but, nev-&#xD;
er mind, you and the gals is young and strong, and&#xD;
so I ortn't to be thinkin' 'bout another and me."&#xD;
As to the son, he entered heart and soul into&#xD;
this plan for a new house, for, as his honest&#xD;
father had said, the old one was getting rather&#xD;
rickety, and he longed to see his patient, selfsac-&#xD;
rificing mother surrounded by more comforts and&#xD;
conveniences while she was still young enough to&#xD;
enjoy them. As to his father, he always had a&#xD;
warm, comfortable corner when he came home&#xD;
from his work, and he could not understand what&#xD;
nice-care and management were necessary to keep&#xD;
that one room, which must serve as a kitchen and&#xD;
parlor, so tidy, cheery, and rest-inviting. He&#xD;
only knew it was so, and when he saw his pa-&#xD;
tient-faced wife looking tired it quite puzzled&#xD;
him, so nice and comfortable as she must be in-&#xD;
doors all day long. Good old man! warmth and&#xD;
rest had become more desirable to him than any-&#xD;
thing else. But his son saw everything in a dif-&#xD;
ferent light; young and strong, and hopeful, too,&#xD;
he looked to working out a future, but in the&#xD;
&#xD;
meantime his dear ones must be made comforta-&#xD;
ble, and hisfirst earnings, swelled by what could&#xD;
be cleared from their small farm, should be ex-&#xD;
pended in building a new house ; then his sisters&#xD;
must be thought of, for he had determined their&#xD;
natural taste for books should be better gratified&#xD;
than it could be at their district school, though&#xD;
with his help they were for the present going on&#xD;
finely.&#xD;
Richard Sumner was most fortunate in pro-&#xD;
curing the place he did as teacher. The people&#xD;
were such as were ready to be pleased by one&#xD;
who entered with a whole soul into the teaching&#xD;
of their children, and before he left them, to the&#xD;
delight of all his pupils and satisfaction of the&#xD;
parents-he was re-engaged for the following,&#xD;
winter at twenty-two dollar a month. With&#xD;
his hundred dollars in his pocket, which, to ex-&#xD;
press their more than satisfaction, the trustees&#xD;
-contrary to custom-got ready for him the day&#xD;
his school should close, he returned to his father's&#xD;
home proud and happy. Why should he not be&#xD;
happy ! in one year he had earned enough to re-&#xD;
pay his father three-fold for what his father had&#xD;
expended for him that extra year at the academy.&#xD;
He had no thought of keeping back any portion&#xD;
of it for little extravagances in clothing-for a&#xD;
time his mother and sisters must attend ; to his&#xD;
wardrobe, as they had ever done. Until he saw&#xD;
them established in a new home he would not&#xD;
aspire to any thing higher than comfortable home-&#xD;
spun.&#xD;
When the crops were disposed of the follow-&#xD;
ing fall, their saved-up sum was swelled to two&#xD;
hundred and fifty dollars. The coming winter's&#xD;
earnings would make it three hundred and sixty ;&#xD;
the old farmer rubbed his hands with glee.&#xD;
"A new house for mother and the girls in two&#xD;
years, my boy-five hundred dollars '11 dew the&#xD;
thing right purty-good 'nough for queens, and&#xD;
they is queens too, ain't they ; Mary's a plaguy&#xD;
purty gal, jist like mother many a year ago, and&#xD;
Nettie, the little weazel, ain't a pin ahind her;&#xD;
childern is a great comfort, Dick-a real solid&#xD;
comfort, my boy ! Well, it will be plaguy nice,&#xD;
though, arter all, I kinder like old quarters, but&#xD;
I wont be too selfish, I can't 'bide self-consate,&#xD;
and young folks is young folks, and must have&#xD;
change."&#xD;
Richard's winter quarters were full twenty&#xD;
miles from his father's home, so the Saturday&#xD;
morning previous to the Monday which was to&#xD;
commence his labors, the family were astir long&#xD;
before day, for Mr. Sumner was to take his boy to&#xD;
the substantial farmer's house where he was to&#xD;
make it his home, and the utmost expedition&#xD;
&#xD;
TIIE PRI&#xD;
would be required to enable the old man to re-&#xD;
turn by bed-time, for to stay away from his home&#xD;
all night he often declared went aging his natur.&#xD;
Never had Mary felt it so hard to be separated&#xD;
from this dear elder brother as now; she knew it&#xD;
was best, she felt it must be so, but that made it&#xD;
no easier to endure. If they could but have him&#xD;
as they had during his year in the academy, every&#xD;
Saturday night it would make the separation&#xD;
much more endurable ; but to gratify some&#xD;
two or three time-saving fathers and mothers&#xD;
Richard had consented to forego the Saturday&#xD;
afternoon's rest, keeping each week out to the&#xD;
utmost limit till five o'clock Saturday evening,&#xD;
and even then hev as not allowed to feel his&#xD;
time his own, nearly all joining in the opinion&#xD;
that their sool master belonged to them is much&#xD;
Sabbath as any other day, and he wondered him-&#xD;
self how they got on without him in the singing&#xD;
at the meetings which were held in the school-&#xD;
house every Sabbath, for when he was there, he&#xD;
and his pupils made up the choir, save now&#xD;
and then a devotional old brother or sister,&#xD;
whom the spirit of piety moved to strike in and&#xD;
do their very best to make the young folks strike&#xD;
Out. So to gratify both parents and pupils Rich-&#xD;
ard decided on making but one visit to his home&#xD;
during the winter.&#xD;
"You must help Nettie on with her studies,&#xD;
Mary ; and you get on as well as you can alone,&#xD;
saving everything you don't understand till I&#xD;
come for that grand visit. It won't be so very&#xD;
long, if you are busy all the time, and I know&#xD;
you will be as busy as a bee-there, there, don't&#xD;
cry Mary, I want to remember your face bright&#xD;
and happy."&#xD;
This was the noble boy's encouraging good-bye&#xD;
o his oldest sister, who was more his companion&#xD;
than any one else. To her he came with all his&#xD;
hopes and anticipations, as well as with all his&#xD;
difficulties and dis, ouragements ; they were in&#xD;
truth to each other all that brother and sister&#xD;
could be. None of those quarrelings and wrang-&#xD;
liugs which ofttimes spring up from intercourse&#xD;
with the world, had this little family ever known.&#xD;
To think of each other seemed withal the most&#xD;
natural thing in life, and now the eldest daughter&#xD;
pressed back her tears, that by her cheerfulness&#xD;
she might make the parting less painful to all the&#xD;
rest: her hopes and ambitions were very high for&#xD;
this brother, and well she knew how necessary&#xD;
was separation, for how could he accomplish all&#xD;
his talked of plans staying with thetm in their little&#xD;
farm home. As to the father, he pronounced&#xD;
them all a set of chicken-hearted babies, to cry&#xD;

am sech lots o' money. But when the tender&#xD;
mother and her two girls were left to themselves&#xD;
they had a good cry together, and then their&#xD;
tears were chased away by hopeful thoughts.&#xD;
When the practical old farmer returned home&#xD;
in the evening, and found their faces all beaming&#xD;
with smiles, he pronounced them the most sen-&#xD;
sible set of women folks he'd ever seen.&#xD;
"He'll make a fortin, that boy of ourn one o'&#xD;
these days ; it would a' did your heart good, moth-&#xD;
er, to a' seen the way they received himjest&#xD;
like he was a minister, or some other great man&#xD;
by jings, didn't I feel proud and no mistake ! then&#xD;

jest like Dick and no body else ; one 'Id think&#xD;
he'd been born a king, by his manners, and yet&#xD;
there ain't tde first grain of stick-up in him."&#xD;
As to mother and the girls, they fully agreed&#xD;
with the enthusiastic father, yet in spite of all&#xD;
her efforts to keep them back, the tears-which&#xD;
were such a mystery to the husband-were&#xD;
silently chasing each other down the wrinkled&#xD;
cheeks of Mrs. Sumner. After a few days they&#xD;
all became accustomed to having the absent one&#xD;
away, and then they all gathered around the&#xD;
large crackling fire in the kitchen, peaceful and&#xD;
happy, after a hard day's work; the mother al&#xD;
ways busy with her knitting or mending-Mary&#xD;
stitching away industriously upon some progress-&#xD;
ing garment, for she was now the only seamstress&#xD;
the family required, while just at her elbow the&#xD;
petted Nettie, who was seven years younger than&#xD;
herself, had her place with arithmetic and slate&#xD;
working her way so hard to get on in a way which&#xD;
would astound brother Dick, when he should&#xD;
come home for his mid-winter's visit. Then the&#xD;
old farmer-who by wife and daughters was con-&#xD;
sidered first and most important on all occasions,&#xD;
occupied his cushioned chair, which ever held its&#xD;
place in the brightest corner-his stockened feet&#xD;
outstretched, his head laid back in the very atti-&#xD;
tude of contentment at the glowing warmth which&#xD;
was shining upon him. Sometimes he listened to,&#xD;
or perhaps joined in the conversation between&#xD;
his wife and oldest daughter, then he would close&#xD;
his eyes for a moment's nap. They did, indeed,&#xD;
present such a picture of humble happiness as&#xD;
many a business wearied man, or fashion-slaved&#xD;
woman might have envied.&#xD;
It was something in this way that Richard ever&#xD;
remembered the little circle at home during the&#xD;
many months he was away from them, for he&#xD;
found very few families so quiet and loving, with&#xD;
whom the world had intermeddled in so small a&#xD;
degree as had it with his own. From his inmnost&#xD;
heart this youth prayed that it might never he&#xD;

&#xD;
otherwise-that his pure-minded sisters would&#xD;
ever have a little circle where their hearts should&#xD;
centre their woman's love-for which life itself&#xD;
would not be too great a sacrifice. The little he&#xD;
had seen outside that home-hearth had convinced&#xD;
him, that in its refining influence, no education,&#xD;
however finished or elegant, could atone for the&#xD;
absence of the teaching and training given by a&#xD;
pure womanly nature, which, in his partiality, the&#xD;
sen saw developed in all its perfections in his&#xD;
own darling mother. So, amidst daily school la-&#xD;
bors, evening studies, and a continual making of&#xD;
himself useful, the first ten weeks went away.&#xD;
Then the time came for his home visit, and never&#xD;
was visitor greeted with fonder hisses, or more&#xD;
hearty words of welcome.&#xD;
But three days' stay had been granted him, and,&#xD;
before he was conscious of it, they were gone;&#xD;
yet it was astonishing how much.had been done&#xD;
in that time. Mary had been helped up in all her&#xD;
difficulties, and the brother was delighted to see&#xD;
how finely she was getting on. Nettie had gone&#xD;
through with an entire reviewing, and was more&#xD;
than satisfied with the praises Dick heaped upon,&#xD;
not only herself, but also her teacher. All the&#xD;
cattle, sheep and horses, had passed before him&#xD;
in their turn, and been pronounced in excellent&#xD;
order; indeed, nothing had been forgotten, and&#xD;
yet Richard went back to his labors with a feel-&#xD;
ing of reluctance,&#xD;
He feared his mother was not well-in her face&#xD;
there was an expression of unusual care ; -he had&#xD;
all the time felt it, but to his anxious inquiries&#xD;
she had answered with a coaxing smile, that was&#xD;
all. In his father, too, usually so quiet, he had&#xD;
noticed a look of uneasiness. When his eyes&#xD;
rested upon the mother's face, though when the&#xD;
boy ventured to question- him upon the subject,&#xD;
the old man had declared with great earnestness,&#xD;
he had never in his life seen mother better; but&#xD;
this could not wholly satisfy Richard, and he re-&#xD;
turned to his school, wishing it was done, and he&#xD;
at liberty to remain with his family. After a time,&#xD;
however, his apprehensions became quieted by&#xD;
one of his father's neighbors calling at his school&#xD;
house to tell him they were all doing finely at&#xD;
home. This friend had called at the old farm&#xD;
house that very morning, knowing he should pass&#xD;
that way, and thinking Richard might like to&#xD;
hear; he had seen and talked with each member,&#xD;
and pronounced them all looking unusually well&#xD;
and in such good spirits-this was very satisfac-&#xD;
tory, and once more this ambitious youth gave&#xD;
himself up heart and soul to his labor.&#xD;

Time sped very swiftly away, until it wanted&#xD;
but one week of the close of his five ionths, and&#xD;
Richard began to feel regrets mingled with his&#xD;
eagerness for the last day, for the tie between&#xD;
teacher and pupil had become very strong.&#xD;
A re-engagement for another winter was&#xD;
talked of, but .the trustees hesitated about in-&#xD;
creasing the wages, they having gone already&#xD;
higher than had ever before been paid ; the young&#xD;
man felt he was now competent to undertake a&#xD;
much larger school, and was very near declining&#xD;
the renewal of the engagement on any grounds-,&#xD;
when circumstances occurred to hasten this de-&#xD;
cision.&#xD;
On Monday afternoon of thelast week, just as&#xD;
the scholars had been dismissed for the day, the&#xD;
teacher was startled bythe entrance of his father;&#xD;
but one glance was needed to show the son there&#xD;
was something very unusual weighing upon the&#xD;
old man's mind ; his face was very sober, and&#xD;
when he grasped the outstretched hand of his boy,&#xD;
and answered that he was well to the affection-&#xD;
ate "How do you do, father ?" there came no&#xD;
smile to relax those sad, stern features, and the&#xD;
voice was very dry and painfully husky. With&#xD;
anxious hesitation Richard enquired after his&#xD;
mother and the girls.&#xD;
Well, well, toy boy, 'taint them that's the&#xD;
matter !" answered the father in an excited man-&#xD;
iner, and then laying his hand upon his son's should.&#xD;
der, he went on in such a pleading tone, " Don't&#xD;
blame me, Dick ; promise me you won't blame&#xD;
me-won't call me an old fool, though I know&#xD;
I've been one-yet I could never stand that--to&#xD;
have my children turn agin me."&#xD;
The son did his best to sooth the father, and&#xD;
now with tolerable heart too, since he knew, what-&#xD;
ever had happened, his mother and sisters were&#xD;
well. After a little while the broken old man&#xD;
commenced his sad story-and sad enough it was&#xD;
too-yet he had no need to fear censures from his&#xD;
son, judging from the looks of sympathy which&#xD;
beaned upon the old man's face, as he went on&#xD;
with his humiliating confession, of how in his&#xD;
desire to grow suddenly rich, as had many of his&#xD;
acquaintances in the neighboring village, he had&#xD;
embarked in the raging wheat speculation, not&#xD;
only risking their snug little sum of two hundred&#xD;
and fifty dollars, bat in the firm beliet that he&#xD;

&#xD;
could make double that amount, he had mortgag-&#xD;
ed the dear old home, to raise an additional five&#xD;
hundred. This had been expended in buying&#xD;
wheat, double the amount it would pay for, the&#xD;
same sworn friend-in truth one of the most&#xD;
shrewd of grasping speculators, who had advanc-&#xD;
ed hin the money on the mortgage-going his&#xD;
security for the payment of the other half, as&#xD;
soon as the old farmer should in his-turn sell ; but&#xD;
to make himself safe, in case of accident, he said&#xD;
he fixed a claim upon the same wheat to the&#xD;
amount for which he was security.&#xD;
This had been in early winter, day followed&#xD;
upon day, not a cent more had-been offered in the&#xD;
market than Mr. Sumner had given; his friends&#xD;
assured him there was nothing to fear, it certain-&#xD;
ly must come sip soon, so the simple hearted old&#xD;
man was content to wait, as it was evident the&#xD;
longer he waited, the greater would be the rise;&#xD;
so said his advisers, and thel were experienced&#xD;
men. But week had followed upon week, and&#xD;
month upon month, and so far from the market&#xD;
price increasing, each day it grew less and less,&#xD;
until his friend Mr. Rich advised him to sell&#xD;
without- an other d ay's delay. This to the old&#xD;
man seemed impossible, and so he told his ad-&#xD;
viser ; now he would not receive a farthing more&#xD;
than half of what he had agreed to pay, and this&#xD;
last was the friend's reason for not only insisting&#xD;
upon a sale, but enforcing it, if there was any fur-&#xD;
ther hesitation; and to his dismay poor Mr. Sumner&#xD;
found he possessed the power, for the time which&#xD;
had been given the old man to dispose of the&#xD;
thousand bushels of wheat-which was the&#xD;
amount he had purchased-had already expired.&#xD;
"And to-morrow it goes my boy, and. every&#xD;
cent 'll go into the pocket of John Rich-he is a&#xD;
villain, I know it now, and I was a fool-but&#xD;
that don't make it no easier to bear. Oh ! Dick&#xD;
it's hard-plaguy hard-poor mother, she looks&#xD;
near heart broke, but the gals try to cheer her,&#xD;
though I can't see any cheer about it !" and the&#xD;
old man buried his face in his hands and fairly&#xD;
8 obbed aloud.&#xD;
his son could not at first believe all was as bad&#xD;
as was represented, but the father once more&#xD;
composed, told that he had sought the best legal&#xD;
advice their town afforded, and had been assured&#xD;
there was no power in law to reach such a trans-&#xD;
action-to let the suit go on, he could in truth&#xD;
lose but the seven hundred and fifty dollars.&#xD;
"But the seven hundred and fifty dollars, he&#xD;
said, my boy, as though that wasn't enough to ruin&#xD;
us! to sech as him it may be nothing, but to an&#xD;
old non like mie, broke down by hard work-it's&#xD;
too much-I'm sure it'll putty nigh kill me, and&#xD;

It was very doubtful about their being able to&#xD;
borrow a sum, to them so very large, on the teen-&#xD;
rity they had to offer, and for the time they nut&#xD;
ask for paying it, and the young man felt it would&#xD;
be hardly the best thing to do if they could. lis&#xD;
father's working days had past, and if the farm&#xD;
was kept with its present incunmbrance, se en&#xD;
months in the year if not more he must himself&#xD;
be there, and then the help they should be com-&#xD;
pelled to hire, would eat up all their profits ; so&#xD;
their only hope of treeing themselves from debt&#xD;
must rest in the winter's labors. Then there was&#xD;
his mother to think of; though much younger than&#xD;
his father, she bad worked too hard all her life,&#xD;
to be forced to it anew, when she began to feel&#xD;
the need of rest; and what was there for the girls&#xD;
but a life of drudgery, if they remained on the&#xD;
old debt incumubered place. If he could but get&#xD;
a situation in some large village school, where he&#xD;
would be employed simmer as well as winter,&#xD;
and could have the family in a snug little home,&#xD;
where he could board with them, Richard felt it&#xD;

sometimes I've been sinful 'nough to wish I could&#xD;

better than do it, she wanted mse to como to you&#xD;

knowed better than she or you, and I did it with&#xD;
out heedin' her counsel, or seekin' your advice,&#xD;
my boy, and I've ruined you all," and again the&#xD;
old man broke down,&#xD;
Richard tried to comfort his father, and indeed&#xD;
it was a comfort that he was so kind, that lie ut-&#xD;
tered no word of reproach ; he had not dared&#xD;
hope it would be so though the mother had tried&#xD;
to persuade her poor husband that their son could&#xD;
act in no other way than kindly. Mr. Sunnier&#xD;
went with Richard to his boarding place, for it&#xD;
was too late for him to think of returning home&#xD;
that night, and in a desponding way the old maia&#xD;
said:&#xD;
" It's of no account now, I might as well get&#xD;
used to stayin' away, for the old place'11 have to&#xD;
go and afore long too"-and after talking it over&#xD;
during nearly the whole night the son was con-&#xD;
vinced the father was right.&#xD;
Their whole farm fell a little short of fifty&#xD;
acres, and although they had good barns, the boise&#xD;
was very poor, so the price for which it would&#xD;
sell under the most favorable circumstances would&#xD;
not be more than twice the amount for which it&#xD;
had been mortgaged. The man who had a cimm&#xD;
upon it would show no mercy, and the time was&#xD;
drawing very near when he would have the pow-&#xD;
er of foreclosing the mortgage, if the borrowed&#xD;
money was not paid; for Mr. Sumner had given&#xD;
his note payable in four months.&#xD;

would be the best thing; and so he toldhis father. the young man's indignation. "My father was&#xD;
The old man listened silently and despondingly. ignorant of your way of doing business; I am&#xD;
The world looked very cold and barren; what proud of saying it, he is an honest man. You&#xD;
he had worked for all his life was gone, and now have wronged him out of his little home-but&#xD;
he and mother and the girls must rely upon poor never mind, he possesses what you do not, sir,&#xD;
Dick! But the young man spoke cheeringly-  and never will-a good conscience and the love&#xD;

thought of so much the father brightened a little, father's loss goes to swell your wealth, it may be&#xD;
but poor old man, dependence seemed a very imperceptibly, it is so small, but it was to him&#xD;
hard thing to him; he -had received his son's as much as your own ill-gotten riches are to you,&#xD;
wages without a thought of dependence, and it was his little all! He is now broken down by&#xD;

different thing from going into a house where he something by which he can still live independ-&#xD;

but this, and bidding his son "good bye," he turn- upon your own head; if it does or does not, I&#xD;
ed his horse's head towards that home-whi ch don't envy you your happiness."&#xD;
he fully realized could be his but a little longer-  Richard spoke with great vehemence, paying&#xD;
with a heart weighed down by gloom and hope- no heed to his father's cautioning, " Dick, Dick,&#xD;
lessness.                                   my boy," but with his eyes flashing with honest&#xD;
Richard determined to stay his time out, for it indignation, he held his parent's creditor silent&#xD;

the losing of this last week; they had counted was such as showed that he felt the young man's&#xD;

in which the neighboring districts were to meet - "Boy, how dare you speak to me in this way?&#xD;
them as enemies, and to all it was a most i m- Do you know I have the power to turn you out&#xD;

he could not now feel so much interest in the  "You have not, sir, law has something to do&#xD;
eambat himself, but he said it would be too hard here," was Richard's proud answer.&#xD;
for him to allow his own 'anxieties to spoil their "We will see, boy, we will see," was the an-&#xD;
sport, and since he could do no especial good by gry ejaculation of the enraged man, as he left the&#xD;

Poor Mr. Sumner's speculation turned out as  "He can do nothing, father. Maybe I was&#xD;

" You can do so, sir !" exclaimed Richard, went away when they saw Mr. Rich coming in,&#xD;
who had sat silently by until now, for it was his for the old farmer wouldn't have them hear all&#xD;
father's business, and he wouldn't interfere, but he might have to say. At the mention of Harry&#xD;
this cold, calculating way of speaking aroused Marston's name, there was a very perceptible&#xD;
&#xD;
11&#xD;
&#xD;
deepening of the rose upon Mary's cheek, which&#xD;
was not lost upon her brother.&#xD;
After telling the mother and the girls that&#xD;
there would be no other way than to let Mr.&#xD;
Marston have the place, father and sen started&#xD;
off to see that kind neighbor.&#xD;
Whatever might have been Mr. Rich's calcula-&#xD;
tions, he was compelled to be satisfied with five&#xD;
hundred dollars and interest for four months, and&#xD;
a few additional words from  Dick, whose bold-&#xD;
ness quite astounded the monied man.&#xD;
"Do you remember Judge Fullerton, Dick ?"&#xD;
asked Mary, one evening as they were going into&#xD;
the house after milking the cows.&#xD;
This had always been the brother's and sister's&#xD;
favorite time of talking over their plans, and now&#xD;
the young man had just finished telling his com-&#xD;
panion what he must be, doing. He had ended&#xD;
by saying:&#xD;
"Mr. Marston is very kind to let us stay here,&#xD;
yet I couldn't think of accepting his kindness&#xD;
any longer than necessary. Harry is at the bot-&#xD;
tom of it, Mary, and although I like it in him, I&#xD;
don't want you should be compelled to feel under&#xD;
any such obligation, I must get a school, that&#xD;
is the best thing for us, and in some village, too."&#xD;
It was in reply to this, that the blushing girl had&#xD;
asked her brother if he remembered his friend,&#xD;
who, excepting the night of the exhibition, he&#xD;
had never seen, but his answer told that he had&#xD;
not forgotten.&#xD;
"Yes, Mary, I do remember him, and now I&#xD;
believe you are thinking of the same thing I have&#xD;
been thinking of these good many days. To go&#xD;
to Marshall, to try my luck in getting a school.&#xD;
Father and mother will think it very far, but it&#xD;
wont make much difference; it can't be more than&#xD;
thirty-five or forty miles, and I do believe Judge&#xD;
Fullerton would use his influence to get me the&#xD;
school there."&#xD;
That evening in thelold kitchen, the matter&#xD;
was discussed thoroughly, and the result was the&#xD;
next day was fixed upon for Dick to start for&#xD;
Marshall. Two days passed and the family bore&#xD;
the suspense with exemplary patience, but the&#xD;
third day found them, from the old father to the,&#xD;
child Nettie, excited and restless ; Richard had&#xD;
told them they should allow him three days, yet&#xD;
they all firmly expected him the evening of the&#xD;
second, and when he did not come, parents grew&#xD;
troubled and Nettie grew fretful, while Mary did&#xD;
her best to reassure and sooth till three. Dear,&#xD;
hopeful girl, her faith in her brother was of itself&#xD;
almost sufficient to secure him success. Before&#xD;
the forenoon of the third day had half gone, Net-&#xD;
tie had been on the topmost rail of the fence not&#xD;
&#xD;
j&#xD;
&#xD;
less than half-a-dozen times to gain a longer sight&#xD;
of the way by which they expected their traveler,&#xD;
and each time as she jumped down, her declara&#xD;
tion had become more emphatic that he was&#xD;
never coming and there was no use in look-&#xD;
ing for him. But he did come in spite of the im-&#xD;
pulsive child's declaration to the contrary, and&#xD;
to her chagrin from the opposite direction fromiii&#xD;
the one she expected, and which she had watched&#xD;
since dinner from her eyry in the topmost branch&#xD;
of the highest pear tree which commanded the r oad&#xD;
and long before she could scramble to the ground&#xD;
the others had welcomed him in their own warm&#xD;
way. The horse must first be tiken care of be-&#xD;
fore the eager ones heard the result' if their&#xD;
Richard's expedition ; so his mother and sist-rs&#xD;
flew around to get something upon the table, ter&#xD;
the poor boy must be nearly fitmished, they all&#xD;
thought. When he came in, however, he bad&#xD;
them leave the lunch, and sit down every one of&#xD;
them, for he had much to tell; besides, he wasn't&#xD;
hungry, having taken dinner about one o'clock.&#xD;
And it was a long story he had to tell the little&#xD;
circle who gathered around him. Just a little&#xD;
in front of his boy, and so close that his hand&#xD;
rested upon his knee, sat the old fa ther, his face&#xD;
bearing the marks of care, and his 'yes turned&#xD;
upon that manly son as his only hope; and then&#xD;
near her husband sat the loving wife and mot her,&#xD;
while upon the other side of the narra tir were&#xD;
the two sisters, and never did speaker have bet-&#xD;
ter listeners.&#xD;
le arrived at Marshall the afternoon of the&#xD;
day he left home, and enquiring for Judge Ful-&#xD;
lerton's office of the landlord where he put up&#xD;
his horse, he made his way to it without delay.&#xD;
At first the kind-faced mann seemed to have for-&#xD;
gotten him, but when his visitor told his ane he&#xD;
grasped his hand more cordially than.the young&#xD;
man had even hoped.&#xD;
"Remember you, indeed I do, my son. I was&#xD;
a farmer's boy, Mr. Sumner; I struggled through&#xD;
many difficulties to gain my education, and that&#xD;
little scene in the academy where I first saw you&#xD;
came - right home to my heart: for an hour or&#xD;
so I was living my academy days over again ; sit&#xD;
down now, for I want to hear all about how you&#xD;
have been going on,"&#xD;
And so Richard had told this whole-hearted&#xD;
man how the three years had passed, and finally&#xD;
closed by revealing the object of his visit; and to&#xD;
his satisfaction Judge Fullerton told him he was&#xD;
almost sure he could secure the village school for&#xD;
him the following fall-but at the same time he&#xD;
said he ought to be doing something where his&#xD;
powers of mind would be brought more into ac-&#xD;

tion, and which would promise a better future.&#xD;
Teaching was wearing mentally and physically,&#xD;
and too often a most thankless as well as slavish&#xD;
life ; and then the remuneration was not what it&#xD;
ought to be.&#xD;
" But we will talk more of this to-night, for you&#xD;
will go home with me, and possibly we may strike&#xD;
out a path for you in the future, which you will&#xD;
think it better to follow than teaching."&#xD;
That evening Judge Fullerton proposed to&#xD;
Richard Sumner the commencing of the study of&#xD;
law in his office. The young man told him how&#xD;
impossible such a thing would be, much as he&#xD;
might wish it. He must think of immediate ne-&#xD;
cessities, which could only be met by his enter-&#xD;
ing a remunerative occupation.&#xD;
" I understand," had been the answer to this,&#xD;
" of course I must understand this; yet is it not&#xD;
possible for you to get on with what you might&#xD;
earn as clerk? For the first year this might be&#xD;
little more than enough to pay your board, we&#xD;
will say three dollars a week, though if you are&#xD;
a pretty rapid penman, and not afraid of early as&#xD;
well as tolerably late hours, I think you could&#xD;
bring it up to five or six dollars after a little time;&#xD;
for you see, my son, this writing is a part of your&#xD;
study, and if twelve hours are spent in the office,&#xD;
six will be as much as you should spend in read-&#xD;
ing, so six will be left for copying; in that time I&#xD;
used to earn a dollar, but it was upon the very&#xD;
nicest work-in truth as confidential clerk. You&#xD;
are a farmer's boy, Sumner, you have been&#xD;
brought up with economical, industrious, and&#xD;
strictly honest habits, you are ambitious, and&#xD;
have perseverance and strength to support your&#xD;
ambition, why should you not take the place in&#xD;
my office, if, as you tell me, your desire has been&#xD;
to enter this profession. By a severe illness I&#xD;
was two months ago robbed of my reliable clerk,&#xD;
I have not been able to fill the place to my satis&#xD;
faction, if you feel inclined to try such a labo-&#xD;
rious course-for you will have to labor if you&#xD;
would succeed-the place is open to you to make&#xD;
a trial: If you come immediately, which I should&#xD;
wish you to do, you will have learned before fall&#xD;
whether you can venture to go on; if you cannot&#xD;
I will promise to do my best to procure the school&#xD;
for you ; now you see, I am offering you nothing&#xD;
but a chance to work your way, but if you do as&#xD;
well as I hope of a farmer's son, it will prov e a&#xD;
mutually advantageous undertaking. Now tell&#xD;
me frankly, how does this look to you, Mr. Sum&#xD;
nor ?"&#xD;
" It looks, sir, as though I would enter it heart&#xD;
and soul, so far as the labor is to be considered,&#xD;
but I must first see how much it will cost our&#xD;
&#xD;
famiy to live here, for it won't do for me to un-&#xD;
dertake anything that will be running us in debt.&#xD;
Neither of my parents could endure such a thing,&#xD;
nor could I; and to begin with, what will we be&#xD;
compelled to pay for rent; a small house, but&#xD;
comfortable, Judge Fullerton?"&#xD;
" I have a cottage a half mile from the office&#xD;
which will be vacated next week; it has two&#xD;
very comfortable sleeping rooms, a small parlor,&#xD;
kitchen and woodhouse, besides a low chamber&#xD;
which answers for storage very nicely, and in a&#xD;
case of emergency, could be used as a bed-room,&#xD;
for it is warm and lighted by two windows, one&#xD;
in each gable; beneath the house there is a good&#xD;
cellar: then a small but excellent garden plat sur-&#xD;
rounds the house, and at the further end of the&#xD;
plat is a barn large enough to shelter a horse and&#xD;
cow, as well as to contain the winter's fodder.&#xD;
How do you think this would answer-it is plain&#xD;
but very decent, and in a most respectable neigh--&#xD;
borhood?"&#xD;
" So far I am sure it would. be most satisfac-&#xD;
tory, sir, but you forget you have not given the&#xD;
most important item to one who is compelled to&#xD;
count costs closely."&#xD;
" Ah ! yes, the rent," exclaimed Judge Fuller-&#xD;
ton. "Well, the family, who have occupied it&#xD;
for two years, agreed to pay me a, dollar per&#xD;
week, though they have always managed to be&#xD;
sorely behind hand; and what I have got out of&#xD;
them had cost me more than it has come to, so I&#xD;
have made u p my mind to let them try another&#xD;
landlord, for there s no reason why they should&#xD;
be objects of charity, being all in good health ;&#xD;
next week they must go; that I think is not an&#xD;
unreasonable rent ?"- This was said question-&#xD;
ingly.I&#xD;
" No, I should think not, for such a snug place,'&#xD;
was Richard s answer, immediately adding, "and&#xD;
if we went into this house, sir, there should be&#xD;
no lack of promptness in paying rent; my father&#xD;
is a very plain farmer, but he has an independent&#xD;
and honest spirit."&#xD;
" And don't lack pride, judging from his son 2'&#xD;
was the   elder gentleman's smiling  remark.&#xD;
Richard's face crimsoned, "you need not be&#xD;
ashamed of it, my son, it is a manly pride that&#xD;
needs not to be blushed for, a pride that would&#xD;
compel you to live upon the meanest fare rather&#xD;
than have it in the power of any man to sky you&#xD;
owed him ought ; it will insure you success, I&#xD;
am confident ; but let us remember what we are&#xD;
about ; if this house suits you, a dollar a week is&#xD;
all that you will have to pay for rent, as to the&#xD;
other expenses, you, as a farmer, know them as&#xD;

In his own mind Richard had already run them  stances. Did I not do right, father I"&#xD;

THE PRIZE ESSAY.&#xD;
&#xD;
to the son to have doubled their receipts, for to&#xD;
the simple wardrobe of each one had been made&#xD;
the necessary additions, so that the second&#xD;
year was begun even more promisingly than had&#xD;
been the first, yet this partial success had not&#xD;
come without labor very severe-often weari-&#xD;
some-for no heart however brave or hopeful&#xD;
will never feel discouragements when they are&#xD;
strewn thickly by the way-no hand or head&#xD;
however willing or strong will never feel fatigue&#xD;
if constantly taxed. But Richard's heart sink-&#xD;
ings were never of very long duration, and be-&#xD;
fore the close of the second year he began to oc-&#xD;
casionally receive P fee for officiating in some&#xD;
petty case ; it might be small, but it was a help&#xD;
to his family. So well did he manage the first&#xD;
few important matters placed in his hands, in&#xD;
such a manly and yet such a lawyer like way,&#xD;
Judge Fullerton, who had already grown to have&#xD;
the greatest confidence in his pupil, tried him&#xD;
again and again each time giving him a more im-&#xD;
portant case, and when the third year o f his&#xD;
studies commenced, his prospects really began,&#xD;
to brigthen.&#xD;
Five years had been the time which his legal&#xD;
father had at first fixed as necessary to admit&#xD;
him, well fitted, to the bar, but so rapidly had&#xD;
Richard advanced in his study, Judge Fullerton&#xD;
told him at the commencement of the third year,&#xD;
that a half of his time had expired, that another&#xD;
two years' close application would fit him thor-&#xD;
oughly for his examinations and admission. This&#xD;
was indeed cheering, and but little time did he&#xD;
have to spend in copying during the coming&#xD;
months-he had grown a very necessary assist-&#xD;
ant in more important matters, and this was given&#xD;
up to those whose time was not as valuable to&#xD;
others or themselves as had his become.&#xD;
That was a happy day to all interested in&#xD;
Richard Sumner, which completed his four years'&#xD;
study. He passed his examinations with much&#xD;
credit, and the very week following the one on&#xD;
which he was admitted to the bar, Judge Fuller-&#xD;
ton received the young man into his office, no&#xD;
longer as mere student, but as a partner in his&#xD;
business. When old Mr. Sumner called upon&#xD;
his son's friend to thank him for his kindness to&#xD;
his boy, the Judge said, in reply to his few touch-&#xD;
ing words of gratitude:&#xD;
"The obligation is on my side, Mr. Sumner; your&#xD;
son has become indispensable to me, and you&#xD;
have yourself alone to thank for the good, whole.,&#xD;
some lessons which you practised before him of&#xD;
industry, economy and honesty, and the advan-&#xD;
tages you gave him for an education. Happily&#xD;
for you and your family, he has improved upon&#xD;
&#xD;
these well, and if you live but a few years, sir,&#xD;
it is my belief you will be the father of a great&#xD;
man."&#xD;
The large tears leaped from furrow to furrow&#xD;
in their uneven course down the old farmer's&#xD;
cheeks, and when he would have spokes, as he&#xD;
grasped the hand of Judge Fullerton, something&#xD;
in his throat choked him, and he turned towards&#xD;
his cottage home without a word.&#xD;
" Who'd a thought it, mother, when we fixed&#xD;
the boy off for the 'cademy, more 'n seven years&#xD;
ago ! I 'gin to think it may be better 'n farimin';&#xD;
arter all, though 'twas plaguy hard givin' up the&#xD;
old place, and it e'en a'most broke my heart, but&#xD;
we ort to be thankful; yes, mother, we ort to be&#xD;
very thankful for sich children."&#xD;
This was the really worthy father's long speech&#xD;
to his tearful, yet happy-faced wife that night,&#xD;
after telling her what Judge Eullerton hud said&#xD;
of Dick; and Mary, the faithful, noble, hoping&#xD;
worker, was sae not proud of her brother? Many&#xD;
a time had Richard said to her during these four&#xD;
years of hard labor, did he succeed it would be&#xD;
to her he should owe his success. To see such&#xD;
steady, loving faith as she had ever had in him,&#xD;
lie would be unworthy such .a sister, did he not&#xD;
accomplish all she expected of him.,&#xD;
Perhaps Richard was right ! Every heart has&#xD;
its fountain of affection, and through that the&#xD;
intellect may be more easily reached than through&#xD;
the outward sense of hearing, by dint of long&#xD;
lectures upon human responsibilities, or per-&#xD;
chance often repeated assurances to. the slow&#xD;
plodder in the road to greatness, that he is a&#xD;
dunce. Both of these last named systems have&#xD;
too often failed of making.from promising boys&#xD;
anything but the merest apologies for men, why&#xD;
should not mother and sisters try faith upon&#xD;
those Heaven has given them,; it is said to be&#xD;
powerful enough to remove mountains, may it&#xD;
not make mountains of goodness and greatness&#xD;
from those minds which chastisement and blam-&#xD;
ing would utterly dwarf?&#xD;
Richard Sumner's first year in his profession&#xD;
was one of steady success. The senior partner&#xD;
in the firm soon began to learn the junior had no&#xD;
common head, to rest upon such young shoulders,&#xD;
and so unwearying was he, apparently so insensi-&#xD;
ble to fatigue, he soon surprisedJudge Fullerton,&#xD;
much as he had grown to expect during those&#xD;
four years of persevering study.&#xD;
At the close of the year Richard made the&#xD;
announcement to the trustees of the village&#xD;
school, that they would be compelled to seek a&#xD;
teacher to fill his sister's place. Such a proud&#xD;
and happy thing as this was for the brother&#xD;

Not more than a month had they been absent had induced Mrs. Moulton to seek the advice of&#xD;
on this visit,when Mrs. Moulton received a letter her former acquaintance, Judge Fullerton. Josh-&#xD;
from a distant relative of this uncle, who said, ua had insisted upon accompanying her, for h&#xD;
&#xD;
did not like to trust her to tell his part of the&#xD;
story.&#xD;
"And what is the name of this man who had&#xD;
taken it upon himself to dispose of matters in this&#xD;
way ?" was the older lawyer's question. "Names&#xD;
have great weight with me-great weight," he&#xD;
added.&#xD;
"Rich, ir; John Rich."&#xD;
As Mrs. Moulton made this reply, Summer, who&#xD;
had before been an attentive listener, started, re-&#xD;
iterating that name three or four times. To the&#xD;
inquiries as to the cause of his excitement, he&#xD;
made no answer, save that he thought he had&#xD;
heard it before, but now his attention became&#xD;
most intense, and when Judge Fullerton, with his&#xD;
natural caution, expressed his doubts as to the&#xD;
advisability of undertaking anything like an in-&#xD;
vestigation, thatthe villain was too wealthy and&#xD;
influential, though he believed there had been&#xD;
foul play, his partner, with much promptness and&#xD;
earnestness, remonstrated:&#xD;
"Let them look about, at least," he said, "let&#xD;
them find what evidence there was against the&#xD;
man. Mrs. Moulton and her daughter had both&#xD;
seen a will in favor of the latter, so had Joshua,&#xD;
who had been a conddential servant. It had been,&#xD;
a common belief that the young lady was to be&#xD;
heir to the uncle's estate; there must have been&#xD;
crooked acting; let them at least do their best to&#xD;
discover it, if there had been.'&#xD;
The old Judge caught something of the young&#xD;
man's enthusiasm, and before the little party&#xD;
broke up, the lawyer had noted eery important&#xD;
and unimportant fact connected with the matter,&#xD;
had learned that Jane, the housekeeper, had gone&#xD;
with Mr. Rich to his city home, that the home-&#xD;
stead had been sold for much less than its real val-&#xD;
ue, and that unless the case should be gained,&#xD;
neither Mrs, Moultn nor her daughter had much&#xD;
to spare for lawyer's fees.&#xD;
In return for all this they eiferced upon the&#xD;
minds of the three the importance of keeping&#xD;
positive silence aeon the subjects, if poerible to&#xD;
lead even their best friends to think they had&#xD;
abandoned all hope in the matter.&#xD;
The next week Sumner thought he could es-&#xD;
cape from home business to quiet look over the&#xD;
whole thing, but their chief hope depended upon&#xD;
quit. After a little hesitation Mrs. Moulton ac-&#xD;
cepted Judge Fullerton's kind invitation to her.&#xD;
self and daughter to make his house their home&#xD;
for the present, that they could the more secure-&#xD;
ly communicate with them; and at the end of a&#xD;
week Sumner started upon the chase which,&#xD;
had his partner spoken his mind frankly, he&#xD;

But at last, to the relief of all, at the end of&#xD;
three thonths he did return, and when he laid&#xD;
out the evidence he had collected in full array,&#xD;
the elder lawyer was silent with astonishment&#xD;
and poor Mrs. Moulton was nearly beside hersel&#xD;
with delight. Immediate ly the prosecution wa,&#xD;
entered into, and in spite of the impatience of&#xD;
the plaintiff and her counsel the time did arri' e&#xD;
for the trial. It added not a little to the excit -&#xD;
ment of young Sumner, knowing that his old&#xD;
school fellow Gary Putnam and his celebrates&#xD;
father were to act as the opposing counsel. In&#xD;
his mind there was no doubt as to who wouli&#xD;
win the prize this time.&#xD;
Neither the defendant in allhis pride of wealth,&#xD;
nor his counsel were prepared for the host which&#xD;
was arrayed against him. There were sons&#xD;

confident Mr. Rich turned a shade paler whet&#xD;

official exclaimed-&#xD;
" Begone, you little rascal, or I'll have you ta-&#xD;
ken to the lock-up ; begone, I tell you, you little&#xD;
vagabond, and don't letme catch a glimpse of you&#xD;
again to-night; if you do, I'll put you where&#xD;
you'll be safe from playing such tricks as this.&#xD;
Do you hear me, eh ?" and he grasped the little&#xD;
fellow by his shoulder and shook him in a furious&#xD;
manner.&#xD;
Wilson did hear, and young as he was under-&#xD;
stood what was meant, though he did not an-&#xD;
swer a word; had he done so, he would probably&#xD;
have been lugged off to the police station without&#xD;
hesitation, but as he had not been even guilty of&#xD;
answering the officer, the latter understood fully&#xD;
the impropriety of carrying such a child away&#xD;
without the least grounds for complaint against&#xD;
him, for the jostle, which had infuriated him so&#xD;
greatly, had been his own fault and not the boy's;&#xD;
this he knew. very well, and so Wilson was left&#xD;
to enjoy his freedom.&#xD;
But this little incident had aroused him to the&#xD;
necessity of seeking some place of shelter, for&#xD;
the next one who should take notice of him might&#xD;
not allow him to pass as well as had this one.&#xD;
The hour was already late, and in that large, cold&#xD;
city there was no heart or house in which Wil-&#xD;
son felt he had a claim; yet to save himself from&#xD;
being sent to that home for the homeless, the&#xD;
friendless, he must find some coner in which to&#xD;
hide himself away. He was now upon one of the&#xD;
handsomest streets in this large city, and just as&#xD;
these thoughts were flitting through his mind,&#xD;
and he was looking timidly about for some covert&#xD;
place in which to creep, he espied by the flicker-&#xD;
ing light of the street lamps that he was standing&#xD;
opposite a fine house fronted by a latticed veran-&#xD;
dah. In an instant he thought this might be as&#xD;
comfortable and secure a place as he should find,&#xD;
and no one could object to his making his bed&#xD;
outside the door; within the porch he felt along&#xD;
the sides until he came to the part most shelter-&#xD;
ed, and was just preparing to crouch down for&#xD;
the night, when the unbolting of the door made&#xD;
him shrink close to the wall; with a savage&#xD;
growl and bark a dog sprang out and immediate-&#xD;
ly the door was closed again, and plainly he&#xD;
heard the bolts and locks secured.&#xD;
The poor child now trembled with terror, ex,&#xD;
peeting the instant he should be discovered by&#xD;
the animal to fall a victim to his rage ; by the&#xD;
dim light he saw that his size was enormous, but&#xD;
now his growling had ceased, and the old fellow&#xD;
was snuffing anxiously towards the corner in&#xD;
which Wilson was trying to conceal himself, and&#xD;
&#xD;
to the boy's surprise he came slowly towards his&#xD;
nook, and after smelling around him fora moment,&#xD;
the noble fellow stretched himself by the side of&#xD;
the boy, all the time giving low glad whines and&#xD;
licking the hands and face of the motherless out-&#xD;
cast in a way most expressive of fondness. Soon&#xD;
the poor child lost all terror of his new companion,&#xD;
and drew his shivering form more closely to the&#xD;
warm shaggy coat, and with his head resting&#xD;
within the huge paws of the animal, this boy of&#xD;
eight years old recalled to mind the assurances&#xD;
which his mother had so often given him, "that&#xD;
God would never leave him utterly friendless."&#xD;
For the first time since his mother's death, the&#xD;
child raised his heart to Heaven in prayer, and&#xD;
then with the breath of his new friend falling so&#xD;
warmly upon his face, he sank into a heavy sleep.&#xD;
During all the cold dark hours of that night,&#xD;
this boy, who had never before gone to his bed-&#xD;
mean though that bed might have been--without&#xD;
a mother's kiss upon his lips, without a mother's&#xD;
hand to tuck the scanty covering around his cold&#xD;
back, slept as one wholly exhausted, dreaming of&#xD;
that mother who could no more feel the griping&#xD;
hand of want. 'It was not surprising that he&#xD;
should sleep, for his watch by his mother's bed-&#xD;
side had been a long and faithful one; besides the&#xD;
exposure to cold with the fasting and grief had&#xD;
been more than enough to exhaust his childish&#xD;
strength ; but the early dawn of day brought to&#xD;
poor Wilson a sad awakening; his strangely&#xD;
watchful bedfellow, with a gentleness which&#xD;
seemed to partake of intelligence more than ani-&#xD;
mal instinct, licked the heavy eyes of the boy as&#xD;
he moved uneasily, and just as the child half&#xD;
raised himself, looking around in a bewildered&#xD;
manner, the opening of the hall door helped&#xD;
him to recall something of the night before.&#xD;
" Neptune, dear old Neptune, where have you&#xD;
hid yourself?" was shouted in a clear, childish&#xD;
voice, and immediately the speaker, a little girl&#xD;
so lithe and joyous, danced out upon the veran-&#xD;
dah. " Merry Christmas, you old rogue; see&#xD;
what Santa Claus has brought you!" and the&#xD;
little fairy held up in her hand a silver collar,&#xD;
bright and new.&#xD;
The dog raised himself upon his fore paws, but&#xD;
made no move to approach the little one, who was&#xD;
evidently his young mistress, and in this half&#xD;
sitting posture he quite concealed the slight form&#xD;
which nestled at his side. Coming forward, the&#xD;
child cried out:&#xD;
" You lazy Neptune, have you no eyes that you&#xD;
don't see this; you had no stocking to hang up,&#xD;
so Santa Claus put it into mine; conic, hold up&#xD;
Your head, and let me trny it on you !&#xD;
&#xD;
.:_&#xD;
&#xD;
The coffin was lowered into the pit prepared for&#xD;
it, and many another one, and throwing in a few&#xD;
shovels full of dirt, the party turned away with-&#xD;
out a word. A moment the child lingered, but&#xD;
the men were not willing to leave him, and one of&#xD;
them taking him by his slender arm drew him&#xD;
along to the cart, and thus the funeral ceremonies&#xD;
of this mother ended. This had been at early&#xD;

THE MITHERLESS BAIRN.&#xD;
&#xD;
The little girl had got as far as the dog's side,&#xD;
and was just about trying the new collar on his&#xD;
beautiful glossy neck, when she made the discoi-&#xD;
ery that her pet was not alone ; although she&#xD;
was startled, there was nothing in the boy's sad&#xD;
face to alarm her.&#xD;
"What have you here, dear Neptune ?" she&#xD;
asked, as she allowed her arm to rest upon the&#xD;
noble animal's neck, and not satisfied with the&#xD;
only answer the dog was able to give, a low&#xD;
whine and delighted wagging of his tail, she ex-&#xD;
claimed, regarding the companion of her dog in&#xD;
a half kindly and half curious way:&#xD;
"Who are you, little - boy ? did Santa Claus&#xD;
bring you to Neptune? ain't you cold, it seems so&#xD;
cold out here, and see, your back is all covered&#xD;
with snow!   What is your name? come, why&#xD;
don't you speak, what made you sleep out here&#xD;
with my dear old Neppy ?"&#xD;
The boy had regarded the little speaker very&#xD;
earnestly, as she had asked question after ques-&#xD;
tion, not giving him a chance to answer, had he&#xD;
been inclined to, and when at last she paused, he&#xD;
had raised himself to his knees, and with a hand&#xD;
resting upon the dog, he said:&#xD;
" My name is Wilson Harley, and I slept here&#xD;
with your dear, beautiful dog, because it was so&#xD;
much warmer than in the street."&#xD;
"The street," was the child's answer; "Oh!&#xD;
you'd freeze in the street, I'm sure ; but why&#xD;
didn't you go home ?"&#xD;
"I hadn't any home to go to, and I was afraid&#xD;
to stay out any longer."&#xD;
The voice in which this was spoken was very&#xD;
tremulous.      I&#xD;
" No home ! where does your father stay, and&#xD;
haven't you any brothers and sisters, nor mother&#xD;
either ?" asked the little girl, bending towards&#xD;
the kneeling boy.&#xD;
" I never had a father, nor brothers nor sisters,&#xD;
and they buried my mother yesterday ; I haven't&#xD;
got any one to care for me."&#xD;
"They buried your mother! what for? wasn't&#xD;
she good, and didn't you love her ?"&#xD;
This was too much for the poor orphaned boy.&#xD;
The day before, with all his grief he had no tears&#xD;
t shed, but the sympathetic questioning of one&#xD;
so near his own years, so touched his little heart,&#xD;
he had no power of controlling his emotions, and&#xD;
hiding his face upon Neptune's shaggy back, he&#xD;
sobbed out:&#xD;
" Mother, oh ! mother, mother !"&#xD;
"Was she so good? did you love her ever so&#xD;
much? then what did they bury her for I if she'd&#xD;
been my mother, they shouldn't 'a buried her; I&#xD;
wouldn't let any one have my mother if I had&#xD;
&#xD;
one; but I never had any-there, don't cry any&#xD;
.more, little boy,-did you ever see Santa Claus ?&#xD;
ah ! he brought me such heaps of pretty things,&#xD;
and just gee this collar he brought for old Nep-&#xD;
tune-dear old Neppy-won't-he look nice ! his&#xD;
hair so black, and this bright as it can be."&#xD;
" Hetty, where are you, Hetty ?" called a voice&#xD;
from the door.&#xD;
" It's my fathe"-said the child, springing to-&#xD;
wards the door-" Here I am, father, come and&#xD;
see this little boy--such a strange thing-he&#xD;
says he's no home, and nobody to love him, and&#xD;
old Neptune, father, I can't call him away from&#xD;
this poor little fellow."&#xD;
"What are you doing here, you little vaga-&#xD;
bond ?" exclaimed the tall, hard looking mart,&#xD;
the moment his eyes fell upon Wilson. "Get out&#xD;
of this, you little thief-aut of this, before I kick&#xD;
you."&#xD;
The boy started up, but when the speaker ap-&#xD;
proached menacingly, the dog, Neptune, seemed&#xD;
inclined to stand protector to the little intruder&#xD;
aga net his master, for be uttered a low growl,&#xD;
keeping himself between the angry man and&#xD;
child ; nor did the dog prove the only one inclined&#xD;
to start in the defense of' the stranger. The&#xD;
girl, Hettie, said with a good deal of firmness&#xD;
for one so young-&#xD;
"le ain't a thief, father ; what makes you call&#xD;
him so? if you should touch him, I think Neptune&#xD;
would bite you. No, father, you shan't touch&#xD;
him"-exclaimed the little one springing for-&#xD;
ward as she saw her parent clench his fist; but&#xD;
there was no need for theinterference, for the dog&#xD;
still kept his place between his master and the&#xD;
little stranger, and his growls were really be-&#xD;
coaning threatening. As to Wilson, for very&#xD;
terror, he had not spoken ; but seeing his two&#xD;
new friends so staunch it his defense, gave him&#xD;
courage.&#xD;
"I ain't a thief, sir;. Inever stole anything in my&#xD;
life; my mother always told me it was very wick-&#xD;
ed. I wouldn't aslept here if I had known it&#xD;
would make you so angry ; if you went strike&#xD;
me I'll go away this minute ."&#xD;
The boy's gentle, earnest way of speaking,&#xD;
seemed to have a soothing effect upon the hard,&#xD;
angry man, or at least acted as a check upon his&#xD;
movements, for when the poor little fellow pass-&#xD;
ed very near him to go down the steps, he made&#xD;
no demonstrations of violence towards him.&#xD;
Still the dog kept his place between the two,&#xD;
and when his master made an effort to call him&#xD;
him back, he stopped, looked around and then&#xD;
followed the child into the street. Hattie smiled&#xD;
triumphantly, for well as she loved her pet, Nep-&#xD;

z&#xD;
&#xD;
and  caution, was working beautifully, ann&#xD;
all had been done so gradually they had rea&#xD;
son to hope the marks of his suffering would&#xD;
not be  very lasting.  As to the children&#xD;
there was just mystery enough about the new&#xD;
comer to make hiMn a hero in their young imagin-&#xD;
ations, and add to this the admiration they all&#xD;
felt for the beautiful dog, Neptune, they were all&#xD;
in a very interesting state of excitement. The&#xD;
noble animal, now that they had discovered his&#xD;
name, seemed much inclined to acknowledge the&#xD;
little folks as acquaintances, but not a morsel of&#xD;
food could they prevail upon him to take until&#xD;
he saw his young master eating of the smoking&#xD;
chicken broth which grandma had prepared with&#xD;
her most skillful hand; then with half an eye&#xD;
upon the recovering Wilson, he took the offered&#xD;
dainty bits from one hand and then from another&#xD;
with a care that told he was accustomed to this&#xD;
delicate way of being f; d.&#xD;
When Wilson at last opened his eyes and look-&#xD;
ed about him enquiringly, every little mouth gaped&#xD;
with curiosity, but the better judgment of the&#xD;
farmer and his wife forbade it being satisfied that&#xD;
night.&#xD;
" Here is your dog, my poor little boy; you&#xD;
see you are among friends ; all you can be per-&#xD;
mitted to say to-night is, tell me what we are to&#xD;
call you! "&#xD;
There was something so tenderly, mother-&#xD;
like, in Mrs. McDonald's voice as she said this&#xD;
it made the poor child feel that lhe was not alone;&#xD;
he remembered the morning, how he had been&#xD;
driven from the porch of that elegant city home&#xD;
by that cold, hard man, who seemed at enmity&#xD;
even with his dog; how doubly desolate had he&#xD;
felt as he turned his step towards his mother's&#xD;
grave, praying in his little heart to die; but for&#xD;
the dog Neptune he might, perhaps, have be-&#xD;
lieved he had changed worlds, so different did&#xD;
everything seem about him, so beautifully kind&#xD;
was every face, and the voice of that mother-it&#xD;
was like what he might have imagined in angels.&#xD;
But the presence of his noble dog, regarding him&#xD;
with such anxious affection, was sufficient evi-&#xD;
dence to the child that he was still on the earth.&#xD;
"Wilson Harley is my name-my mother called&#xD;
me Willie," was his answer to Mrs. McDonald's&#xD;
inquiry as to what they were to call him.&#xD;
Even the half wild Jemmy and Davie were&#xD;
struck with the musical softness of his voice ; a&#xD;
moment more his large eyes were fixed 'upon&#xD;
that sweet mother's face which bent over him,&#xD;
and then he added:&#xD;
" You may call me Willie; when you spoke it&#xD;
&#xD;
d made me happy, it sounded like my mother-will&#xD;
- you call rue Willie?"&#xD;
" Yes, my child we will call you Willie, if you&#xD;
wish it; now shut your eyes and don't speak any&#xD;
more; you are not well, Willie, and we can't let&#xD;
- you talk to-night; if you are better in the morning&#xD;
' you may speak all you like."&#xD;
The child lay shutting and opening his eyes in&#xD;
a languid manner like one wholly exhausted and&#xD;
riot anxious ever to make another exertion, and&#xD;
at last his half dreaming vague thoughts of his&#xD;
r loved mother and that over bending face became&#xD;
l so happily combined in his mind, he felt no longer&#xD;
motherless, friendless, homel ss, and he fell into&#xD;
a quiet refreshing sleep.&#xD;
The shadows of evening were gathering in this&#xD;
farm home, and the father, with his boys Jernmy&#xD;
and Davie, put on coats, caps and comforters,&#xD;
and went to the barns to attend to the feeding and&#xD;
caring for their sleek, well kept stock; while the&#xD;
mother and grandma turned their attention to the&#xD;
little household matters, to making everything&#xD;
cheery for the evening; so only the younger chil-&#xD;
dren lingered near their little visitor to watch&#xD;
him and his beautiful Neptune. No sooner dii&#xD;
the dog see his master sleeping, than he stretched&#xD;
himself upon the floor, his face toward the settle,&#xD;
and with his nose resting upon his outstretched&#xD;
paws, he watched the child with half closed eyes.&#xD;
It was a most lovely sight, such an one as might&#xD;
have charmed others than the McDonalds, but im&#xD;
their minds they were already forming plans for&#xD;
the grandest sport, in which Neptune and Willie&#xD;
were to figure largely ; for front the good old&#xD;
Scotch grandmother to the six-year old Mamy,&#xD;
every mind was made up as to Willie really be-&#xD;

the novelty should have its charm for the little&#xD;

were they accustomed to being assisted in their&#xD;
snorts or studies by any one outside their little&#xD;
circle, and each one had determined Willie should&#xD;
be made the happiest boy in the world.&#xD;
The little earnest Mamy, as she sat upon her&#xD;
little stool rocking the cradle, thought how she&#xD;
would show him all -her picture books and tell&#xD;
him the beautiful stories her mother had told&#xD;

take some interest in doll-babies; if he would&#xD;
help her in caring for her numerous family what&#xD;
a nice thing it would be, for her only sister was&#xD;
this wee baby in the cradle, and her brothers had&#xD;
no fancy for such quiet fun; Jemmy didn't object&#xD;
to having a nice frolic with his sister's darlings&#xD;
if he could have it in his own way ; but nothing&#xD;

THE MITHERLESS BAIRN.&#xD;
&#xD;
become the pet plaything of every member of the&#xD;
family, a sweet romping child, loving and beloved&#xD;
by everybody.&#xD;
From Mrs. McDonald's face, one was inclined&#xD;
to say not only years but care had touched her&#xD;
lightly, and mother never looked upon her grow.&#xD;
ing family with a more heart-felt gratitude than&#xD;
did this faithful worker. Nor was it only youth&#xD;
and those in vigorous life that time had spared ;&#xD;
still the quiet grandmother was there to smile upon&#xD;
the p-osperity of her children, and her grand&#xD;
children, some of them grown quite to manhood,&#xD;
knew no greater pleasure of an evening than to&#xD;
gather in grandma's room and listen to some story'&#xD;
of her girlhood, when her home had been far, far&#xD;
away, in that land of real Lairds, which no true&#xD;
Scotch heart, while it has a throb of life, can&#xD;
cease to remember with a child's devoted love;&#xD;
and none loved these little gatherings more than&#xD;
did Wilson Harley, now known to the family and&#xD;
all their friends as. Willie McDonald; with the&#xD;
other children he was often declared "grandma's&#xD;
favorite.  But she had no favorites in her affec-&#xD;
tions, though Willie's never-failing attention to&#xD;
her every little want, made her depend upon him&#xD;
more than upon any other one of the family, and&#xD;
his voice was so clear, although it had become&#xD;
quite difficult for her to hear common conversa-&#xD;
tion, she never lost a word he said to her, though&#xD;
he didn't speak half so loud as did the other boys;&#xD;
on this account, Willie was nearly always the dear&#xD;
old woman's reader, and of winter evenings there&#xD;
was nearly always to be found a little party of&#xD;
three, in the snug little room, grandma occupying&#xD;
her old-fashioned high-backed rocking chair, and&#xD;
her " eternal knitting" as Jemny called her never&#xD;
failing knitting work, occupying her fingers; near&#xD;
herjut beside the little table, Willie with his&#xD;
book had his place, and opposite him, busy with&#xD;
her sewing, Mary was nearly always found; but&#xD;
this did not make up the whole of the little cir.&#xD;
cle; laying at the young girl's feet, upon a com-&#xD;
fortable cushion, was the old dog Neptune. He&#xD;
had become a veteran indeed, but the tender care&#xD;
he had received had kept him hale and hearty, in&#xD;
spite of age, and no one di-puted tme- good old&#xD;
fellow's right to lay at Mary's feet, let her choose&#xD;
her seat wherever she might; the moment he saw&#xD;
her settled, with his comfortable cushion in his&#xD;
mouth, he would walk-with not exactly the&#xD;
elastic step of a young dog, for his limbs were&#xD;
considerably affected by rheumatism; and it was&#xD;
in consideration of this slight ailment, that he&#xD;
was honored with a cushion-but his gait -and&#xD;
manner had in them much of sober dignity, as he&#xD;
would move across the room, and after deposit-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing the cushion in a satisfactory style at the feet&#xD;
of the young girl, he would stretch himself upon&#xD;
it, his soft clear eyes, as they were opened and&#xD;
shut lazily, speaking cf his heart full of content-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
Such was the family which filled the very com-&#xD;
fortable home of farmer McDonald, and never&#xD;
for a moment had any one felt regret that the&#xD;
homeless Wilson Harley had found a place in&#xD;
their home as well as in their hearts on that bit-&#xD;
ter Christmas afternoon long years ago; yet in&#xD;
the minds of all the McDonald'stie motherless&#xD;
Wilson had become completely lost in their own&#xD;
brother Willie, loved not a grain less because he&#xD;
was brother and son by adoption instead of by&#xD;
birth.&#xD;
"What are you looking for, Mary, child ? You&#xD;
have stood at the window well nigh an hour and&#xD;
not a word have I heard you speak in all that&#xD;
time. Are you expecting any one, dearie, that&#xD;
your eyes have not been turned to the right or&#xD;
left this long time ? "&#xD;
" Father must be coming'soon, grandma, and I&#xD;
was watching for him."&#xD;
" And why she uld you watch so steadily, Mary;&#xD;
it's nae sae uncommon a thing for him to gang&#xD;
awa' that ye should be sae anxious, my bairnie ! "&#xD;
" But, grandma, father has gone to the city to&#xD;
see about a place for Willie ; I heard him talking&#xD;
with mother and Willie before he went away this&#xD;
morning ; Mr. Phelps has for a long time been&#xD;
offering a place in his store to one of the boys,&#xD;
and to-day father has gone there to decide whether&#xD;
he will accept it, and I heard him say it was just&#xD;
the business for Willie."&#xD;
" Your faither is right, Mary. Willie is a right&#xD;
smart laddie, but nae just sae strang to be put to&#xD;
books like Jemmy or to farming as Davie; he&#xD;
must ha' something that will tax mind and body&#xD;
alike, and a merchant house must be of that kind.&#xD;
Why dinna ye answer, my bairn, are ye displeas-&#xD;
ed that your father should think of sending the&#xD;
laddie awa' to the city ? '&#xD;
There was something of trembling in the voice&#xD;
which said : "No grandma, you know I would not&#xD;
think of being displeased with what father and&#xD;
mother thought best to do; but wont it be very&#xD;
lonesome to have Willie go away? We shall all&#xD;
miss Jernmy very much, and- I have been sad&#xD;
enough when I remember how close at hand the&#xD;
time is for him to go away ; but to have Willie&#xD;
go too, it will be so lonesome we shan't know how&#xD;
to live, and I'm sure I don't know what you will&#xD;
do, grandma, when the long evenings come-no&#xD;
body to read to you."&#xD;

better that he should be away. And now, Mary,&#xD;
are you satisfied as to family."&#xD;
"Yes, David, I should think our Willie might&#xD;
be very comfortable there; that he would not miss&#xD;
those he leaves at home more than we could wish&#xD;
him to."&#xD;
"And what do you say, my boy ?" asked the&#xD;
farmer of the youth.&#xD;
"That it is best for me to go, father; I am not&#xD;
needed at home, and- it is time I began to think&#xD;
about doing something.."&#xD;
"That is right, Willie; I am glad to hear you&#xD;
speak so decidedly, for it seems a very favorable&#xD;
opportunity. Now, how soon can you get him&#xD;
ready, Mary, for Mr. Phelps said they were in a&#xD;
very busy time, and the sooner he could have&#xD;
Willie, the better he should be pleased."&#xD;
And, now between the farmer and his wife,&#xD;
grandma andWillie, there was planning and talk-,&#xD;
ing, which ended in the conclusion that the nild-&#xD;
die of September was the earliest possible time&#xD;
that the boy could leave home for the city ; now&#xD;
it was the last week in August and there was&#xD;
much to be done in these three weeks, for this&#xD;
was the time fixed upon for the departure of the&#xD;
eldest son from his home to commence the study&#xD;
of medicine with an uncle in an Eastern city.&#xD;
This uncle was his mother's brother! He held a&#xD;
very high place in his profession, and when on a&#xD;
visit to his sister a few months previous, had&#xD;
taken a great liking to the bright, spirited&#xD;
James, insisting upon his being sent to him&#xD;
to be fitted for the medical profession. He&#xD;
had no sons of his own,, and had seemed so anx-&#xD;
ious for this, that at last the parents had been in-&#xD;
duced to think it best that they should be sepa-&#xD;
rated from their child, since such .advain  Y s as&#xD;
were now offered him, their moderate cicum-&#xD;
stances would not allow them t, give all their&#xD;
children. The uncle had assured the parents&#xD;
that there could be no lack of home enjoyments&#xD;
to their son in his house, his wife was of that class&#xD;
of women whose province was her own fireside,&#xD;
and nothing would gratify her more than the&#xD;
presence of her husband's nephew in her family !&#xD;
And as there was in the city a medical college of&#xD;
the very best standing, there seemed every in-&#xD;
ducement for their accepting the offer, which was&#xD;
not to cast their carefully trained son upon&#xD;
strangers for society.&#xD;
This had ever been the* loving mother's anxi-&#xD;
ety as she each day had studied to make their&#xD;
home the most attractive place on earth to her&#xD;
children; the thought would continually come up&#xD;
that by-and-bye they might be cast upon strangers&#xD;
wh would care very little whether they were&#xD;
&#xD;
RLESS BAIRN.&#xD;
happy or miserable. She could scarcely hope&#xD;
that it would be otherwise with some, at least,&#xD;
of such a numerous family, and then'they would&#xD;
be driven to seek society where snares were&#xD;
thickly spread ; her husband had shared this&#xD;
anxiety, realizing the dangers which the world&#xD;
contains for those cast upon it for society much&#xD;
better than she could, especially those who had&#xD;
been raised in the pure atmosphere of such a&#xD;
home, and this was his very good reason for&#xD;
making every effort towards fitting them for set-&#xD;
tling them as fast as they came of an age to decide&#xD;
what was best suited to their tastes and capaci-&#xD;
ties. They must not think of the pain ;attending&#xD;
a separation; their children were not given them&#xD;
to hold selfishly, but to prepare for acting a part&#xD;
in the world, and if that preparation could not be&#xD;
made fully while under the eye of their parents,&#xD;
then father and mother must resign their society&#xD;
for a time that their trust might be well kept.&#xD;
But well did they look to making this going&#xD;
away as pleasant as it might be. There must be&#xD;
a home to go after each day's labor ; a table to&#xD;
sit at, healthful morally, intellectually and physi-&#xD;
cally; and since nothing of this could be found in&#xD;
a boarding house, no boarding house could receive&#xD;
their well-bred country boys ; and until a place&#xD;
within a quiet family circle was secured to re-&#xD;
ceive them, they said " no" to all business offers,&#xD;
no matter hoy advantageous they might seem.&#xD;
All had listened to the conversation which re-&#xD;
lated to Willie's going to the city, and when it&#xD;
was at last settled that he and James were to&#xD;
leave home on the same day, the latter exclaimed,&#xD;
in his' gay, thoughtless way,&#xD;
"I'm glad we're going at the same time, Wil-&#xD;
lie, for my irnd has been oppressed with the&#xD;
conviction tte-t 1 shouldn't be miss d in a way&#xD;
which would be very flattering; for my life I can't&#xD;
make out that I am a particle of use to any&#xD;
one in the establishment, and I am convinced,&#xD;
were they to make any demonstrations of sorrow&#xD;
when I am going, they must be so feeble as not&#xD;
to be satisfactory. But you'tl be missed by all,&#xD;
from grandma down to Amy, and I can'have&#xD;
a chance to go in for a share of the tears which&#xD;
will be shed for you'"&#xD;
" For shame! my son, to speak in this way of&#xD;
the grief we must all feel at losing you for a&#xD;
time!" the mother's voice was almost reproach-&#xD;
ful as she said this; "you don't deserve the regret&#xD;
we must all feel, Jemmy, if you speak in this&#xD;
thoughtless way of it."&#xD;
" No, mother, I was not thoughtless, but more&#xD;
serious than I often am; I have felt this very&#xD;
much. Who ever calls upon me for anything?' In&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MITER&#xD;
truth, I believe the only decided thing I do for&#xD;
anybody in the house is to torment the younger&#xD;
children, that I may hear them makeitheir droll&#xD;
complaints to you, mother; and then I enjoy my&#xD;
peace-making with you after they are sent away&#xD;
so much ; how can I help feeling my absence will&#xD;
relieve them of a pesterer, and you of a great.&#xD;
care ?"&#xD;
The speaker's voice had lost much of its gaiety,&#xD;
as this was said in a way that left no room for&#xD;
any doubt as to his seriousness. Littly Amy,&#xD;
who was usually his victim, but who after all&#xD;
loved him with a child's capricious fondness, was&#xD;
upon his eldest brother's lap, lavishing upon him&#xD;
her sweetest caresses as an assurance that after&#xD;
all lhis teazing he was the best brother in the&#xD;
world, and all save the grandmother expressed&#xD;
their full agreement with the child.&#xD;
" Ye said right, Jeminy, yer deeds bae been nae&#xD;
praiseworthy; butye hae weel managed the heart&#xD;
o' every ane o' the household, that whether we&#xD;
would or nan, we maun lo'e ye, and we shall miss&#xD;
you sairly, laddie, but nae sae selfishly as your&#xD;
brither Willie !"&#xD;
As the young man bent over the old lady to&#xD;
kiss her wrinkled cheek for this loving chiding, a&#xD;
tear fell upon her old withered hand, and in an&#xD;
instant all her assumed severity was gone.&#xD;
"Ye're a gude laddie, Jenmy, yell be missed&#xD;
all---eairly missed, I tell ye, my bairn-" and&#xD;
with this the old grandmother hurried to her own&#xD;
room, where an hour or two after the children&#xD;
found her as usual, very calm and cheerful, but&#xD;
her eyes bore the traces of tears.-&#xD;
After all his thoughtless gaiety, this youth, her&#xD;
David's first born, was the darling of the old&#xD;
woman's heart, and many a tear had fallen silent-&#xD;
ly as she had thought of his departure from his&#xD;
home; but so quiet had been her grieving, the&#xD;
object of them had no suspicions that she gave&#xD;
him a thought.&#xD;
The three weeks which followed the -cision&#xD;
that Willie should go to the city were buy ones&#xD;
with the farmer's home, and no one could have&#xD;
imagined that one of the two youths, for w hom&#xD;
all these preparations were making, had been a&#xD;
stranger to the house until he was eight years&#xD;
old; in everything they were equal, and Davie,&#xD;
who continually asserted his determination to&#xD;
stick to home and the farm life, declared that but&#xD;
for old Neptune he should believe it was all a&#xD;
dream! that Christmas day! And to all it was&#xD;
much like a dream, but to none more so than to&#xD;
Willie.; even to this time his foster-niother often&#xD;
talked with him of that other mother who had&#xD;
so long been at rest; but his heart no longer&#xD;
&#xD;
LESS BAIRN.                                35&#xD;
grieved over the death of one who had kum N&#xD;
naught but sorrow. He loved the family who had&#xD;
adopted him as they had been his own, and ne -&#xD;
er had they allowed him to feel himself alone.&#xD;
Yet at the same time his ambitions were not the&#xD;
same that they might have been had he been a&#xD;
child by birth; all this love and care would then&#xD;
have come naturally, and, like his brothers, he&#xD;
would have been content to receive it without&#xD;
further thought; now it was owing to th ir pure&#xD;
benevolence, and he would reward them by pro -&#xD;
ing himself worthy the affection which had so&#xD;
blessed him.&#xD;
To Mary these three weeks were very sad ones;&#xD;
to lose two brothers at one time was more thin&#xD;
she knew well how to endure, but there was to&#xD;
much to be done-to have any time to spend in&#xD;
repining, and from daylight until late in the evei-&#xD;
ing the young girl kept her place in her grand-&#xD;
mother's room, stitching busily upon the shift ts&#xD;
which were to form a part of the brother's oow-&#xD;
fit; but in spite of her bravest iflrts the tears&#xD;

Jim will soon follow-there's no use in waiting,&#xD;

Willie was of Davie's opinion, and thought the&#xD;
longer they delayed their departure the more pain&#xD;
were they giving their mother and all their dear&#xD;
ones, and so the two were soon seated in the&#xD;
wagon which was to take them to the depot wait-&#xD;
ing to be joined by the eldest brother, who might&#xD;
have lingered, no one could tell how long, hadinot&#xD;
his father suggested the possibility of his being&#xD;
left behind, did he not hasten his last adieus.,&#xD;
The poor old grandmother felt the parting more&#xD;
deeply than did any other member of the family,&#xD;
but in the solitude of her own room she gave vent&#xD;
to her grief, for well she knew that each heart felt&#xD;
sadness enough without having it increased by&#xD;
witnessing her emotion, which she could not&#xD;
subdue.&#xD;
Such was the home which the motherless Wil-&#xD;
&#xD;
establishment could scarcely fail to be annoying;&#xD;
yet Wilson was one to become very soon accus-&#xD;
tomed to change, and the second week he was&#xD;
nearly as much at home behind the counter as&#xD;
from long practice he had become at swinging the&#xD;
scythe or holding the plough; and not more dif-&#xD;
ficult was it for the well-bred youth to learn the&#xD;
real comforts to be found in the simple elegance&#xD;
of the home surroundings.&#xD;
Mr. Phelps soon saw he should have no cause&#xD;
to regret the addition he had made to his house-&#xD;
hold. Having been trained by such a tender&#xD;
mother, and lived constantly in her society,,the&#xD;
boy was ever thoughtful of what he could do-,&#xD;
of what service he could be to the wife of his&#xD;
employer; then the three children, the eldest a&#xD;
daughter named Delia, being near the age of&#xD;
Mamy, were not long in learning how delightful&#xD;
it was the having one so kind and ready always&#xD;
to help them in their difficulties with their les-&#xD;
sons; and before the first month had come to a&#xD;
close, at which time by arrangement he was to&#xD;
go home for a few days, Wilson had become so&#xD;
much a helper in the family of Mr. Phelps that&#xD;

THE MITHERLESS BAIRN.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Hush! hush ! every one of you-no, Jack,&#xD;
don't say any thing more"- said the mother in a&#xD;
kind but determined voice-"your pa was speak-&#xD;
ing to Wilson, yet you have given him no chance&#xD;
to answer ; now mind you are not to open your&#xD;
lips to speak one word, my sons, till you show a&#xD;
better humor."&#xD;
"And aint Delia to hold her tongue too ? she&#xD;
began."&#xD;
" Jack, be quiet or I shall send you away from&#xD;
the table; that is not a very good humored remark;&#xD;
you are in an unenviable state of mind this morn-&#xD;
ing, and I shall be compelled to punish you if I&#xD;
see much more of it."&#xD;
This acted as a-.silencer upon the little fellow,&#xD;
but it was a very surly-obedience. Wilson liked&#xD;
these children for they were really geod hearted&#xD;
boys, and Delia, a handsome, high spirited girl,&#xD;
often amused him very much ; but it was impossi-&#xD;
ble for him to be among them, and not often in his&#xD;
mindcontrast them and his young brothers and&#xD;
sisters well trained, and no matter how full of&#xD;
fun, never forgetting the obedience and respect&#xD;
which they owed their parents, or even their eld-&#xD;
er brothers and their quiet sister Mary. Yet the&#xD;
Phelps children were very fond of each other,&#xD;
and doatingly fond of their parents ; but a little&#xD;
firmness was required on the part of the parents&#xD;
to make them a most loveable little family, and&#xD;
the absence of this respectful governing bid fair&#xD;
to make them little better than their ungainly&#xD;
brother, who had caused the father and mother&#xD;
too many saddening hours ; yet Mrs. Phelps was&#xD;
very desirous of training her children rightly, and&#xD;
fully believed she did her very best towards mak-&#xD;
ing them well mannered ; she did not realize that&#xD;
such a surly obedience as her boy Jack had given&#xD;
her at the breakfast table was not obedience, but&#xD;
the result of fear that he should be sent away&#xD;
with a half completed meals and no acknowledg-&#xD;
ment of a mother's right to command obedience,&#xD;
" Let's see ! this is Friday, you will be back&#xD;
on Monday morning, r suppose, Wilson ?" asked&#xD;
Mr. Phelps, when order was once more restored&#xD;
among the younger members of the family.&#xD;
" Yes, sir, I will try to get back by the first&#xD;
train, which I am sure I can do as father is a&#xD;
very early riser."&#xD;
"By the first train ! Oh ! well that will be very&#xD;
convenient, though I should not have required it.&#xD;
I hope you will enjoy your visit, Wilson, the&#xD;
weather promises to be very fine, and a few days&#xD;
in the country would'nt be unpleasant to any one.&#xD;
Call at the store, if you please, on your way to&#xD;
the depot; I have a letter to write fcryour father,&#xD;
which, if you will take that trouble, I will intrust&#xD;
&#xD;
to your care ; you can't have muclh time to lose,&#xD;
it's half-past eight and the cars start at half-&#xD;
past nine, so you had better come right along&#xD;
with me."&#xD;
This the merchant said as he arose from the&#xD;
breakfast table, at the same time looking at his&#xD;
watch. Wilson 'was not sorry to accompany his&#xD;
employer, for he had already began to feel a full&#xD;
measure of impatience to be on his way. As they&#xD;
walked quickly in the direction of the mercantile&#xD;
house, Mr. Phelps talked to his clerk in the kind-&#xD;
est possible manner of his future, and then alluded&#xD;
to his position in his family ; he told him that he&#xD;
must not allow Jack and Billy to encroach upon&#xD;
his hours of leisure, which in justice to himself he&#xD;
should devote to useful reading, save sufficient to&#xD;
be spent in active out-of-door'exercise.&#xD;
" Now I will detain you but a moment ; I&#xD;
would write your father a few words, which you&#xD;
shall deliver to him." This the gentleman said&#xD;
as he approachad his desk and proceeded to ex-&#xD;
amine the outside of a handful of letters which&#xD;
had been left there for him. "Here, Wilson,"&#xD;
he said, turning to his companion and extending&#xD;
towards him  a letter, " here is something for&#xD;
you, from your brother, if I mistake not, in Bos-&#xD;
ton, I think you said he was."&#xD;
The youth answered in the affirmative, at the&#xD;
same time grasping the letter, -which, from its&#xD;
size, was far more properly called a package.&#xD;
"Now your time of waiting wont be tedious,"&#xD;
was the employer's remark, as he opened his&#xD;
desk and proceeded to write to farmer McDonald&#xD;
a few lines expressive of his perfect satisfaction&#xD;
in his son.&#xD;
Wilson' was not long in breaking the seal' of&#xD;
his brother's letter, for he had heard from him but&#xD;
once since his arrival in his new home, and he&#xD;
was all eagerness to learn how everything ap-&#xD;
peared to the gay fellow after a little better&#xD;
acquaintance. The letter commenced:&#xD;
"Willie, my dear fellow, I have now so much&#xD;
to write I hardly know where to begin ; your&#xD;
letter was received more than a' week ago; its&#xD;
contents gave me overwhelming pleasure ; but I&#xD;
was not at all disappointed, for the Phelps family&#xD;
would be in pretty business to treat you in any&#xD;
other way than with the greatest consideration.&#xD;
Ask mother and dear grandma as to the respect-&#xD;
ability of the McDormlds and the Wallaces,&#xD;
which last, you know, was mother's name, and&#xD;
you will see either of them grow a full inch taller&#xD;
from the rising of their " Scotch pride," as father&#xD;
calls it; no, there is scarcely a family in the land&#xD;
who has a broader foot-hold for their pride than&#xD;
ours ; but I must acknowledge I never knew&#xD;

much of this until I came to live with uncle&#xD;
James. We lived so quietly at home ! father and&#xD;
mother were forever too much absorbed in keep-&#xD;
ing their harum-scarum boys in order, to attend&#xD;
much to the display of family dignity. I presume&#xD;
they were right. Ah ! Willie is it not a comfort&#xD;
to think of our life at home? We have reason,&#xD;
at least, to be proud of the part of our family&#xD;
which we have known. A woman who on every&#xD;
occasion won the love and admiration of her&#xD;
children, who never humbled herself before one&#xD;
of them by losing the command of her temper,&#xD;
who never left one of her boys even in anger, but'&#xD;
forced them to see their fault in its true light.&#xD;
I tell you, Willie, the remembrance of all this&#xD;
often weighs upon my mind, for, as dear grandma&#xD;
would say, "To whom muckle isgiv'n, mann we&#xD;

but when at last she came, all my indiffmence&#xD;

Chloa. I had expected to see a girl of the sanme&#xD;

Farnham's eyes are of no common kind. I now&#xD;
know what color they are, because she has told&#xD;
me, but they are those eyes which change with&#xD;
every thought, yet she assures me they are gray-&#xD;
as she says-ugly gray. I don't know how to&#xD;
desci ibe her that you can have any idea of her&#xD;
looks. Her hair is brown, or of a color nearly&#xD;
as uncertain as her eyes, and slightly wavy; she&#xD;

&#xD;
memory, for it was that, and not distrust, which&#xD;
kept her from choosing another pet. The old&#xD;
fellow took away with him all the heart the child&#xD;
had for a dog. How I would like that they should&#xD;
meet again, and if Neptune was not so old, I&#xD;
might think the thing not improbable. But, no&#xD;
more of this now-the future we may dream of,&#xD;
but it must be worked out patiently, and how&#xD;
different a thing may it prove from what we in&#xD;
fancy saw.&#xD;
"Write me, my dear fellow, very soon, and tell&#xD;
me how all this made you feel ! Would you have&#xD;
Hettie (I call her so now) know who you are,&#xD;
and that her dog Neptune, somewhat rheumatic,&#xD;
yet well cared for, is under the protection of your&#xD;
sweetest sister Mary? If you would, I should be&#xD;
.more willing to tell her now than I was on that&#xD;
evening; you must be going home soon, but if&#xD;
you don't mind I would rather you didn't show&#xD;
this letter to all of our folks ; I would just as&#xD;
soon Mamy would see it as not, but the rest-I&#xD;
hardly know why-yet I think Davie would&#xD;
laugh, and dear father and mother and grandma&#xD;
might say I was a foolish boy., So you had bet-&#xD;
ter not mention having received a letter from&#xD;
me, and new, my best of brothers, good bye--I&#xD;
shall look for an answer very soon, and your are&#xD;
not the fellow to disappoint me.&#xD;
"Give my love to Mamy and a caress to old&#xD;
Neptune, and believe me your faithful-JIM."&#xD;
And this was from the gay thoughtless James&#xD;
McDonald, who had but one month ago left his&#xD;
home as frolicsome and fun loving as when he&#xD;
was no more than a dozen years old. But to&#xD;
Wilson it possessed a higher interest than even&#xD;
the 'change which it showed to have taken place&#xD;
in the mind and heart of the writer. So much&#xD;
had he become absorbed in the reading, that but&#xD;
for his employer Wilson would have allowed&#xD;
the train to have left him, Mr. Phelps, for a&#xD;
few moments, watched the youth, rather hesi-&#xD;
tating to interrupt him, but when he saw no&#xD;
signs of an end to the work in hand, he said :&#xD;
" The letter is ready for your father, Wilson,&#xD;
and as it wants but a few moments of car time, I&#xD;
would propose that you get aboard before finish-&#xD;
ing the reading of your letter, for you would not&#xD;
like to be left behind."&#xD;
Wilson's face crimsoned with mortification,&#xD;
that he had been guilty of forgetting himself so&#xD;
completely, but thanking his employer he folded&#xD;
his brother's letter hastily and placed it with the&#xD;
one for his father in his pocket, he bade thekind&#xD;
Mr. Phelps good bye, and made his way with no&#xD;
lingering step towards the depot.&#xD;
In his seat the boy was at liberty to give hiui.&#xD;
&#xD;
41&#xD;
&#xD;
self up to the perusal of this interesting cominu-&#xD;
nication, and not until he was well nigh his jour-&#xD;
ney's end did he refold and place it in security.&#xD;
Often enough had Wilson walked through the&#xD;
crowded streets peering into every face which he&#xD;
met or passed, hoping that fate might throw the&#xD;
child Hettie in his way, but all his search had&#xD;
been in vain. As to the house which had been the&#xD;
child's home so many years ago, he had not the&#xD;
most distant idea of its whereabouts, for on that&#xD;
tedious Christmas morning the poor boy had pos-&#xD;
sessed neither eyes nor heart for the surrounding&#xD;
world. Many had been the time he had strolled&#xD;
through the streets at evening trying to select the&#xD;
handsome building in the perch of which he had&#xD;
crouched for shelter, but so many of the houses&#xD;
had the same appearance, he could form n iblai&#xD;
of its locality even! Then to at last learn 'w ho&#xD;
was the child, to have her, after so many years,&#xD;
tell the sad story of his destitution, and express&#xD;
such a desire to hear what had been his fate, was&#xD;
it strange that his boyish heart was stirred with&#xD;
deep emotions ?&#xD;
lHe was by no means blind to the deep interest&#xD;
his brother's letter expressed, nor did it give himii&#xD;
any anxiety, but he did long to consult his moih-&#xD;
er before answering James' inquiries as teo t4he&#xD;
propriety of revealing to this young girl the--&#xD;
cret to her very interesting story. Jamce' vwiih,&#xD;
however, that none of his family, save Mary,&#xD;
should see his letter, put this last it if the b1140's&#xD;
power, and made up his mind to read the wliole&#xD;
thing with his sister and abide by her decision,&#xD;
and with this conclusion he set out upon his two&#xD;
miles' wall, which was to end at the door of the&#xD;
McDonald farm house, and a warm wI elec (Ie did&#xD;
he find awaiting hini there !lie had not lee eicx-&#xD;
pected till the following morning, but the surpi is'&#xD;
gave all additional pleasure.&#xD;
The thousand questions which were showered&#xD;
upon him defied all attenips at answering, par-&#xD;
ticularly with such difficulties as the y outh had to&#xD;
contend with in the shape of fond kisses and&#xD;
caresses. Little Amy, who in the affeetions of&#xD;
parents, brothers and sister felt no inclination to&#xD;
yield her place to elders or superiors, in spite of&#xD;
coaxings or remonstr:ances, accrued bent on siffi-&#xD;
eating their visitor, and not until her gramihca in-&#xD;
terposed her emphatic thre'it to exclude the child&#xD;
from her room for a whole day unless she behaved&#xD;
more as a reasonable being, could they unlock her&#xD;
little arms which clasped Willie's neck. lut t he&#xD;
child knew  too well the folly of expecting iny&#xD;
swerving in her grandparent, after once her word&#xD;
had passed; and the idea of being banished fromin&#xD;

THE MITHERLESS BAIRN.&#xD;
&#xD;
would have been terrible enough,-but now,'&#xD;
when dear Willie was with them, to come into&#xD;
such disgrace would be almost unbearable; but&#xD;
to think of him and Mary with the young broth-&#xD;
ers, and that gayest of all brothers Davie, with&#xD;
whom she was something more than with anybody&#xD;
else, congregated around the delightful crackling&#xD;
fire in the evening, listening to one of grandma's&#xD;
stories, such an one as was sure to be brought forth&#xD;
on so rare an occasion; end she always had the very&#xD;
best place for seeing everybody in the circle, of&#xD;
hearing all that was said, and asking all the ques-&#xD;
tions she chose-to be excluded from the room-&#xD;
the bare thought was enough to make her a tol-&#xD;
erable biddible child.&#xD;
But while all the rest now took their turns in&#xD;
the greetings, the little sprite was off to a pas-&#xD;
ture, a long way from the house, to carry the&#xD;
glad tidings to Davie, who was engaged upon the&#xD;
repairing of a sheep-shed, and although the&#xD;
pleasure of carrying such glad tidings was a suf-&#xD;
ficient reward for her long breathless run, her&#xD;
brother's resources for giving her pleasure never&#xD;
failed him, and now mounting the delighted girl&#xD;
upon his horse, which he had there to assist him&#xD;
in the dragging of some heavy timbers, he sprang&#xD;
on behind her and the two had a grand half&#xD;
mile's canter home, arriving just as the idea had&#xD;
entered the heads of the younger boys to carry&#xD;
the news of Willie's arrival so unexpected to&#xD;
their elder brother! But their little sister too&#xD;
&#xD;
one of you. It is short, children, so you can en-&#xD;
dure the restraint, only be quiet."-&#xD;
"My dear sir--As your son is about starting&#xD;
for his home on a visit of a few days, 'I cannot&#xD;
deny myself the pleasure of writing you a fewj&#xD;
words, expressive of my perfect satisfaction of&#xD;
our new relation. He has a good business mind,&#xD;
much better than you gave me any reason to ex-&#xD;
pect, and judging from his appearance he is&#xD;
pleased with his situation. If it would be any&#xD;
satisfaction to you to know what I think of&#xD;
him intellectually and morally, it is enough&#xD;
for me to say I should be proud to be called&#xD;
FATHER by such a     youth.  I hope much&#xD;
from his influence over my boys-indeed my&#xD;
wife says he is already much more to them&#xD;
and our daughter than are all their teachers ; and&#xD;
here I have an idea your advice might be of great&#xD;
service to the boy ; by your fatherly arraige-&#xD;
ment his evenings are his ow:2, but as yet he has&#xD;
derived very little good from them, for my chil-&#xD;
dren have discovered that he possesses an almost&#xD;
magical power of teaching what was before un-&#xD;
learnable to them, and while heshows a willing-&#xD;
ness to assist them, they won't listen to my per-&#xD;
suasions to leave him quiet for even a moment.&#xD;
Besides, I am nearly always away, and so have&#xD;
very little control over my family. As to my&#xD;
wife, her mother's' ondnesa makes it seem a very&#xD;
easy thing for any one to sacrifice to her children,&#xD;
and I know it must be a great relief to her to have&#xD;
&#xD;
often stole a march upon them to allow them to them so quiet of evenings and yet so perfectly&#xD;
lay their disappointment to heart very much, and happy ; but since your son's duties do not extend&#xD;
as usual they contented themselves by saying they to the nursery or school-room, I don't think it&#xD;
didn't care so Davie had come.              right for him to slave himself of evenings, drilling&#xD;
"What have you there, father and mother? " long lessons into heads not over quick to under-&#xD;
asked David after he had gived Willie his own stand ; they have the best of teachers, but it is&#xD;
warm hearted welcome, and espied his parents not like sitting down with some one who will&#xD;
wholly absorbed over some kind of a paper-Is it talk and explain as Wilson does ; however, I am&#xD;
a letter from Jim ? if so, I'm sure we all have a not willing he should deprive himself of the only&#xD;
right to share its contents."              liberty he has, and as my hints to that effect have&#xD;
" No, Davie, it is a letter to your father from  had no influence over him, and my direct inter-&#xD;
Mr. Phelps ; Willie brought it."           ference might lead my wife as well as the chil-&#xD;
" A note to father for your bad behavior, eh, dren to think me careless of their comfort, I&#xD;
boy !" exclaimed David, shaking Willie by the would suggest the advisability of your enforcing&#xD;
shoulders.                                  upon your son the improvement of his evenings&#xD;
in reading and exercise ; you can understand this&#xD;
"I'm sure I don't know," was the laughing from me much better than lie could; a family man&#xD;
answer; "I was its bearer, ht it contain what it finds many difficulties which must be met, that&#xD;
may, and I don't believe Mr. Phelps would be not even his wife can appreciate. Mrs. Phelps is&#xD;
unjust towards me !"                        already very much attached to your son, and I&#xD;
".There, you are a capital fellow, my son! a trust all may continue as pleasant as it has com-&#xD;
capital fellow, certainly. I haven't finished yet, menced ; you must come with your wife to visit&#xD;
but if you will all be quiet for a moment, I will us and him. Perhaps it might be as well not to&#xD;
read the letter aloud to you, for I cannot suppose give your boy any idea of the contents of this note,&#xD;
it interests me a whit more than it must every he might not understand my real motive, and med-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MITHERLESS BAIRN.&#xD;
&#xD;
dling always seems veryunpleasant. I wish you&#xD;
all much pleasure in this visit, and hope Wilson&#xD;
will not be the less content for it when he returns&#xD;
to our home, and now it is time for him to be off.&#xD;
Yours very respectfully,       A. PHELPS.&#xD;
The end of this letter was greeted with a shout&#xD;
from David, and all felt inclined to laugh at the&#xD;
closing charge, that the boy should know nothing&#xD;
of its contents, when he and his brothers and&#xD;
sisters had already listened to the whole reading.&#xD;
" I can see no harm in your having heard it,"&#xD;
remarked the father. "There is no danger of&#xD;
your looking upon it in the light Mr. Phelps feared&#xD;
you might. The deepest intere t in your welfare&#xD;
suggested the writing of it, and I am sure we&#xD;
must all think him very kind."&#xD;
"Very kind, may be, David, but nae so very&#xD;
clever. Is it mair needful to his bairns that&#xD;
they hae siller mair than will meet their wants,&#xD;
or a faither's care?  Puir laddies ! it will be nae&#xD;
sae muckle their fault if they grew up fules."&#xD;
This the old grandmother said with all her&#xD;
Scotch severity.&#xD;
" No, nd, mother, you must be just; Mr, Phelps&#xD;
provides the best of teachers f'or his children,&#xD;
and it would hardly be his fault if they do&#xD;
badly."&#xD;
"David, I tell you a' the teachers in the land&#xD;
are nae sac gude as the laddie's ain faither, and&#xD;
the tnither-if she be such an one as should be-&#xD;
is better than either. Where would hae been a'&#xD;
yer ain bairns but for Mary's teaching and care;&#xD;
and noo in a' the country round ye'll find a better&#xD;
taught family than yer, ain, David! and yet ye&#xD;
talk o' teachers for this merchant man's wee,&#xD;
tender things?&#xD;
But mother, you forget we were ,too poor to&#xD;
have teachers for all our large family. Had I&#xD;
been but a quarter as rich as Mr. Phelps, I&#xD;
would never have permitted Mary to take such&#xD;
a burden upon herself as she was compelled to&#xD;
in this thing."&#xD;
" I know, David, the mither o' yer bairns has&#xD;
nae had an idle life ! But has she nae a light&#xD;
heart noo, when her work is so weel promising&#xD;
in the world, and the lad o' this rich man, I did&#xD;
not hear ye say he had made the heart o' his pa-&#xD;
rents sairby his wrang doings. Nae, my son, I&#xD;
like nae the man's writings o' his children, or&#xD;
their mither-its nae praiseworthy, but our Wil-&#xD;
lie has been too well trained to gain ill frae ain&#xD;
mair feeble than himsel."&#xD;
The old lady spoke in a stern disapproving tone,&#xD;
which her son well understood, and anything from&#xD;
him would but increase her severity, and had he&#xD;
spoke frankly he would have condemned the care-&#xD;
&#xD;
43&#xD;
&#xD;
less manner in which Willie's employer alluded&#xD;
to his wife and children, but the little this good&#xD;
farmer had seen of business men, had convinced&#xD;
him that once allow the mind to become absorbed&#xD;
in the pursuit of wealth, there was great danger of&#xD;
the best part of man's nature-his pure domestic&#xD;
tastes-completely dying out: and when the fat h-&#xD;
er once becomes negligent of the little circle, who&#xD;
have a right to look to him for love and tender-&#xD;
ness ; when he shifts all his duties on the mother&#xD;
of his children, can he complain that she in her&#xD;
turn, wearied with a life barren of s3 mpathy,&#xD;
leaves her work to be done by hirelings. And then&#xD;
when the offspring grow up, fit only to spend im&#xD;
dissipation and recklessness the gold which their&#xD;
father had hoarded up for them in lieu of instilling&#xD;
into their minds good precepts, and by ex:niple&#xD;
teaching them that life was an earnest thing, thii&#xD;
shall they dare to imurpiur that they have been&#xD;
denied the treasure which they see their more&#xD;
humble neighbors in the full enjoyment-children,&#xD;
which are a crown of glory to their world wea-&#xD;
ried parents ?&#xD;
These reflections had some influence in prevent-&#xD;
ing farmer McDonald from defending this wealthy&#xD;
man against his excellent mother's attack. With&#xD;
her sterling goed sense and quick perception he&#xD;
knew she saw the evil, and since fault findingaind&#xD;
censure would do no good, he thought it better&#xD;
that nothing more should be said.&#xD;
But there was one other in this little family&#xD;
circle who had his thoughts of this way of leav-&#xD;
ing children to hirelings-that was Willie ; and&#xD;
his old grandmother had spoken truly when she&#xD;
said there was no danger of his learning ill from&#xD;
one more feeble than himself; but he was not at&#xD;
all inclined to give up his fhice of helping the&#xD;
Phelps children, for he was becoming really at-&#xD;
tached to them, and their doleful stories of Ihwir&#xD;
ill-tempered teacher had quite excited his coii-&#xD;
passion. As to his parents interforing, he had no&#xD;
fear of that; it had been too much the business of&#xD;
one child to assist another in their family, for&#xD;
either of his parents to look upon it with disalp-&#xD;
proval.&#xD;
"Serve them  as you do the boys and Amy,&#xD;
Willie, they are very kind to you there. If you&#xD;
can in some measure return the kindness-wthich&#xD;
we know you can by your attention to the boys-&#xD;
it is no more than right. We would rather you&#xD;
would be in the family as one of them, even sup&#xD;
posing you do sometimes have annoyances, than&#xD;
that you should be excluded from the domestic&#xD;
circle. If the little fellows grow to be trouble-&#xD;
sonme, serve them the sameo way you would your&#xD;

little brothers, for now you know there isno dan-&#xD;
ger of offending the parents.".&#xD;
"Yes, he says there is a girl, too, as old as&#xD;
Mamy"-put in David-" he is to pull her ears,&#xD;
ain't he father? And now I'm so glad business&#xD;
is done the first thing ; you know your line of&#xD;
action, Willie ; hurrah ! won't you have a jolly&#xD;
time when you get back to the city folks, and&#xD;
won't we have a jolly time while you are here,&#xD;
hurrah ! my boy, why don't you shout just once ;&#xD;
so much room as there is here, no brick walls or&#xD;
dusty streets," and the sturdy young farmer per-&#xD;
formed the most ridiculous antics, first with&#xD;
kicking his slouched hat in the air, and then by&#xD;
upsetting his youuger brothers.&#xD;
Every member of the farmer's family seemed&#xD;
to c-tch the gaiety of its master-spirit, and Willie&#xD;
took deep breaths of enjoyment, whether sport-&#xD;
ing with the children, laughing with David andI&#xD;
Mary, or talking more gravely with their parents&#xD;
and grandmother. It was strange that the youth&#xD;
never indulged in those longings so common with&#xD;
orphans or foundlings-longing for kindred in&#xD;
blood. But he never had-his life had been too&#xD;
full of love for him to wish for more, and blessed&#xD;
by such parents, brothers and sisters, was it not&#xD;
sufficient?  To wish that his own mother could&#xD;
have lived seemed to him cruel, so pale had been&#xD;
her cheek, and languid her step, what could there&#xD;
have been in her toilsome life that one who loved&#xD;
her should desire its continuance? 'Tis true, he&#xD;
sometimes had dreams of his father-who he had&#xD;
been, and was he living or dead, but one thing he&#xD;
knew: to him he had ever been dead, and was it&#xD;
not enough that his mother had been pure as an;&#xD;
angel? But all this would have been so differ-&#xD;
ent but for the wholesome home training which&#xD;
had surrounded him. No questionings of his&#xD;
parenta,'e, no allusions to the past, save to speak&#xD;
to him in the most loving manner of his dead mo-&#xD;
ther ; no recalling of his destitution, or reminding&#xD;
him of his dependence. From the fond old grand-&#xD;
mother down to the petted Amy, he was their&#xD;
own Willie as entirely as had he been born in the&#xD;
house; his place was as secure as was that of the&#xD;
first-born, not only in hearts, but in home; and&#xD;
none, to have seen him among his dear ones, to&#xD;
have looked into his clear, happy eyes, would&#xD;
have dreamed this could be the sad, motherless&#xD;
child who had on that Christmas eve wandered&#xD;
homeless and hopeless through the dismal streets&#xD;
of the heartless city-thought of by none, cared&#xD;
for by none-for whom no simple heart gave a&#xD;
throb. Now home and love were his, and the&#xD;
world was no longer cold or desolate !&#xD;

The first and second day of Willie's home visit&#xD;
passed, and yet not even for one little minute had&#xD;
he been able to steal Mary from the rest of the&#xD;
family for a private reading of that letter which&#xD;
was hid away in a most secret place, and which&#xD;
contained so much that was deeply interesting to&#xD;
him; and Sunday promised to bring little more&#xD;
than had Friday or Saturday, for the day was&#xD;
already waning, and yet all that the youth had&#xD;
done towards the accomplishment of the desired&#xD;
object, was to whisper Mary that in some way&#xD;
she must get rid of the tormenting children as he&#xD;
could not go away without seeing her by herself&#xD;
for a half hour at least, as he had something from&#xD;
their brother Jemmie, which he must read to&#xD;
her, and which no one else could be permitted to&#xD;
see.&#xD;
This made the girl so fidgety, she stood a very&#xD;
good chance of disclosing the whole secret. If&#xD;
Willie had but told her he wished a half-hour&#xD;
with- her alone, it would have been enough, but&#xD;
hearing it was something about Jemmie, some-&#xD;
thing which was to be concealed from the rest of&#xD;
the family, nearly upset the child. She was yet&#xD;
but a young girl-had not even got rid of her&#xD;
little girl tastes, but such a constant companion-&#xD;
ship with mother and grandmother had made her&#xD;
a strange mixture of woman and child; and now-&#xD;
so like as it will with a woman-the dreadful&#xD;
apprehension of temptation, and a yielding to it,&#xD;
came stealing over her. But no sooner was she&#xD;
conscious of the presence of the thought than&#xD;
did she, with quick anger at herself, repel it as&#xD;
unworthy the sister of their dear James.&#xD;
"No, oh ! no," she said to herself, "Jemmie&#xD;
is too noble, he is too strong; nothing could make&#xD;
him forgetful of himself, of the loving hearts which&#xD;
would be wrung with agony, if but the shadow&#xD;
of shame were to fall upon him. No, it is not&#xD;
that, or Willie could not have been so happy all&#xD;
this time ; neither can he be sick, for Willie&#xD;
would not keep that from father and mother ;&#xD;
he must be home-sick, yet loath to tell of it; must&#xD;
be wretched away from     parents, grandma,&#xD;
brothers and sisters; must be pining to get back&#xD;
into their' loving midst! Oh, if it is only this,"&#xD;
she continued to herself, with the greatest en-&#xD;
thusiasm, "wont we all open our arms to wel-&#xD;
come him to his old place again!"&#xD;
Dear little Mamy, with all her heart-with all&#xD;
her -womanly feelings, she had no suspicions of&#xD;
the truth'; she had no dream of their dear James&#xD;
&#xD;
TILE MITER&#xD;
falling in love, and that too with a child not a&#xD;
year older than herself-not a year older than his&#xD;
own little sister! as he was ever calling her "the&#xD;
heroic defender of a whole family of broken-&#xD;
headed doll-babies." But, when a youth, not yet&#xD;
too old to delight in victimising unfortunate dolls,&#xD;
takes it upon himself to fall in love, it seems&#xD;
most fitting that the recipient of his passionate&#xD;
devotion should be one, not yet passed the tender&#xD;
age, which feels for the miseries of such senseless&#xD;

his companion ; walkig slowly along ho read tlw&#xD;

less intense than that which he had fit when ifirt&#xD;

" Now tell me, dear Mamy, what do you think&#xD;

At five o'clock on Sabbath day there was al- ashamed of, and as much as I love all i bro-&#xD;

ent it these gatherings, which seemed toofferlittle y oung man's answer, and the tones of his voic&#xD;

company him; the latter declined with a shrug&#xD;
of the shoulders, saying if he wished a nap, he&#xD;
thought his bed a much more comfortable place&#xD;
to take it than the hard, strait-backed seats of&#xD;
the school-house. The younger boys received&#xD;
the invitation with prompt refusal, and little Amy&#xD;
wouldn'tgo 'cause the men sung in such a funny&#xD;
way she couldn't keep from laughing, and young&#xD;
as she was her sense of propriety told her this&#xD;
was no place for merriment.&#xD;
From Mary now he could only expect com-&#xD;
pany, and her eagerness in accepting the invita-&#xD;
tion opened her brother David's eyes to the fact,&#xD;
that at last he had been outwitted ; but for their&#xD;
ingenuity, he said, the two deserved to walk by&#xD;
themselves, and in his mind he resolved to qines-&#xD;
tien them very closely when they should return,&#xD;
to snake sure whether or dot they made the school&#xD;
house the termination offtheir walk. If they did&#xD;
not attend the prayer meeting he resolved to have&#xD;
his revenge by a good laugh at the two.&#xD;

anxious to thank her, who was so kind to y i4&#xD;
when you had no friend. You iiust write all this&#xD;

Willie, she misses you two boys very much ; I&#xD;

It was very seldom that this young girl forgot&#xD;
her timidity so entirely, even with those of her&#xD;
own family, to speak so unreservedly, and prob-&#xD;
ably she had never givens her adopted brother a&#xD;
greater pleasure than now in speaking so frankly&#xD;
of their relation. He too had often of late the&#xD;

46'                  THE MITHERLESS BAIRN.&#xD;
&#xD;
come to be all in life to him, he was thankful they&#xD;
were not his family by nature; at any time, even&#xD;
a month ago, he could not have explained the&#xD;
cause of such a feeling, but- absence from his&#xD;
home, and more than all, this letter from James,&#xD;
had opened his eyes somewhat, not only to the&#xD;
understanding of his brother, but as well to a&#xD;
little more clear understanding of himself.&#xD;
A minute Wilson thought of this, hesitating,&#xD;
whether or not it would be right to throw a new&#xD;
light into the mind of this child-woman; by ex-&#xD;
plaining James' reluctance to speak to the young&#xD;
girl of him; evidently Mary had no suspicion of&#xD;
the truth, yet he was confident but a word would&#xD;
be required to make her see all in its real light,&#xD;
but without that word it was all a puzzle to her;&#xD;
at length he said:&#xD;
"Mary, can't you imagine Jemmie may prefer&#xD;
remaining the object of chief importance with&#xD;
this interesting stranger? Although 1 would not&#xD;
accuse him of insincerity in what he said of his&#xD;
brotherly attachment and unwillingness that the&#xD;
world should know that we were not by nature&#xD;
brothers, yet I think there was still an higher&#xD;
motive in this case for his keeping silent; he was&#xD;
not even willing to speak of old Neptune to this&#xD;
Henrietta Farnham; he would have been jealous&#xD;
of one little thought she might have given her&#xD;
dog, once so dearly loved ; and the same feeling&#xD;
prevented his telling her of me. Do you not&#xD;
think so, my dear Mary?"&#xD;
The young girl looked at her companion half&#xD;
doubtingly.&#xD;
" What do you think, Willie? or I know what'&#xD;
you, think; but Jemmie is so yourg to us, younger&#xD;
than you are; can it be that h6-can it be as you&#xD;
think ?&#xD;
" Don't you think it is, Mamy? Just read that&#xD;
letter to yourself, and then tell me why did he&#xD;
say father and mother would call him a foolish'&#xD;
boy, and why would David laugh, if he was not&#xD;
guilty of something to him unusual? I know we&#xD;
have all regarded him as a boy among us, but&#xD;
that letter shows him possessed of deeper and&#xD;
more manly feeling than we had any of us imag-&#xD;
ined ever moved him, so gay and light hearted as&#xD;
he has ever been, and I am much mistaken, my&#xD;
little Mamy, if he has not ventured upon that&#xD;
very man-like perforiance of falling in love with&#xD;
my old friend of thd parch; when you have given&#xD;
that letter a second reading you will agree with&#xD;
me, I have no doubt about it."&#xD;
Mary took the letter which her companion&#xD;
handed her and read it through very carefully,&#xD;
judging from the time which was consumed&#xD;
in the operation, and when she came to the end,&#xD;
&#xD;
she folded it up silently, her face looking very&#xD;
anxious and seber.&#xD;
" Well, Mary, tell me what new discovery have&#xD;
you have made, for you have changed very much&#xD;
during the last half hour ?"&#xD;
Willie said this in a cheerful voice, for to him&#xD;
all seemed very bright and cheering.&#xD;
" You are right, Willie, I think it must be as&#xD;
you say ; Jemmie loves this beautiful, rich girl&#xD;
very much; but, oh! I am so afraid it will not be&#xD;
a happy thing; you mind how he speaks of her fa-&#xD;
ther-I could not-no, she could not love, one&#xD;
who would speak or think in this way of her fa-&#xD;
ther; and don't you remember what you have&#xD;
said of him? lHe must be a dreadful man, and&#xD;
he would never let his child nmarry our James,&#xD;
though he must think him good enough for any&#xD;
body. This will make him very unhappy-poor&#xD;
Jemmnie--I'm sure it will."&#xD;
There did, in truth, seem great reason for anx-&#xD;
iety as Wilson was ready to acknowledge, though&#xD;
he had not before seen it; yet, as he told Mary, it&#xD;
was not best to borrow too much trouble, for if&#xD;
it was as they suspected-if James did in truth&#xD;
love this child, he would not at present think of&#xD;
declaring it to her ; so young as they both were-&#xD;
particularly the girl-and he but just started to&#xD;
work out his position in life, years at least must&#xD;
pass before either one could think of marriage&#xD;
seriously; and in, but one or two years what&#xD;
chance for change; in four or five they might cer-&#xD;
tainly hope for a much greater; in that time James&#xD;
McDonald might attain to a position to make him&#xD;
an object to be sought after.&#xD;
Mary was not so very sanguine as to the first&#xD;
part of this proposition. She knew her brother's&#xD;
impatience too well in the most trivial matters&#xD;
to be so very certain of his acting with such pro-&#xD;
priety in so important a case; yet none could be&#xD;
more hopeful than was she of her brother's future,&#xD;
should nothing occur to darken his spirit-this&#xD;
was what troubled her in this affair.&#xD;
Very little attention was given by Wilson or his&#xD;
child companion to the services at the school-&#xD;
house; the mind of the latter was too much ab-&#xD;
sorbed with the contents of her brother's letter&#xD;
to think of anything else, while Willie was turn-&#xD;
ing over and over in his mind Mary's manner of&#xD;
receiving the intelligence which he had commu-&#xD;
nicated. Not so much on account of the influence&#xD;
this intelligence might exert over any' one inter-&#xD;
ested was it that he gave the matter so much&#xD;
thought, as the clear peep which the shy child had&#xD;
given him of her real character, which was much&#xD;
more that of a woman than a child. He smiled,&#xD;
as well he might, when he remembered that he&#xD;
&#xD;
was but two years older-in years more of a&#xD;
child than Mary according to the usual compari-&#xD;
sons of the world, but he felt as did every one&#xD;
else that his childhood so full of trial had ex-&#xD;
ercised over him a wonderfully maturing influ-&#xD;
ence, and in the famliy of farmer McDonald he&#xD;
knew he was regarded as the eldest among their&#xD;
children; to him had been intrusted the teaching&#xD;
of the younger members in many branches of&#xD;
study, while no one would dream of such a thing&#xD;
as James or David acting in any other capacity&#xD;
than amuser or tormentor of the boys or Amy ;&#xD;
and then his reading had been of that vigorous and&#xD;
improving kind which had greatly aided in the&#xD;
forming of his real character.&#xD;
At first this solid reading had been commenced&#xD;
to gratify grandma McDonald, who, as other&#xD;
amusements and occupations failed her, fell back&#xD;
upon what had been the delight of her girltiood--&#xD;
but very soon he found in those long quiet even-&#xD;
ings a double enjoyment, and when he reached&#xD;
the age of sixteen he would have shamed many&#xD;
a man, who counts himself learned, by his supe-&#xD;
rior knowledge of history and nice taste in the&#xD;
refined and poetic authors which had found their&#xD;
way to the farmer's book-shelves. Had this moth-&#xD;
erless boy been at heart purely sefish, he could&#xD;
not have acted in a way more conducive to his&#xD;
own interest, for while he had ministered to the&#xD;
enjoyment and improvement of those who had be-&#xD;
friended him in his sorest extremity, he had been&#xD;
treasuring up knowledge which even now was&#xD;
giving him a position and influence far superior&#xD;
to his years-and this would be the result, almost&#xD;
universally, could the young be made to consider&#xD;
the happiness of those around them worth a.&#xD;
small sacrifice from themselves ; but this is one&#xD;
thing which can alone be taught by constant ex-&#xD;
ample.&#xD;
On their way home, Mary and Wilson spoke&#xD;
very seriously of James, and what should be writ-&#xD;
ten to him, and their conclusion was that it was&#xD;
better to wait until he confided his secret to them,&#xD;
ere they ventured any cautions or remonstrances.&#xD;
As to his telling this Henrietta Farnham of the&#xD;
interest they had all felt in her ever since that&#xD;
Christmas day, neither Wilson or Mary could&#xD;
see what should prevent his doing it; indeed both&#xD;
concluded that they owed it to her, so much lisp-&#xD;
piness as she had, through her noble dog, been&#xD;
instrumental in securing to them, yet Mary could&#xD;
not get rid of her anxiety when David rallied her&#xD;
on her new fancy in attending the prayer meet-&#xD;
ing, she found it very difficult to answer him in&#xD;
any thing like her usual manner, and then the&#xD;
thoughtless boy declared she was becoming Meth-&#xD;
&#xD;
('diat, and that they should none of them be per-&#xD;
mitted to speak but in just such a tone after this&#xD;
But after a time, by Willie's interference, 1)avid&#xD;
became interested in something besides tormnent-&#xD;
ing his sister, and thed, according to the custoti&#xD;
of the old school Presbyterians, with the deepen-&#xD;
ing of the twilight the family began to asttnw&#xD;
their week-day amusements and occupations, and&#xD;
a very merry time they had of it, giving Mary a&#xD;
full opportunity to recover her usually quiet&#xD;
mood.&#xD;
"And when are we to see you again, Willie,&#xD;
my dear boy ?" asked Mrs. McDonald as th y&#xD;
were about to say good night; "all wdi be in too&#xD;
much of a hurry to-morrow morning to give us a&#xD;
chance to say a word but good-bye, so every thng&#xD;
else must be got through with to night, will yin&#xD;
come home at the end of another month ? for I&#xD;
am not sure that we shall not all be longing fir&#xD;
'the repetition of this cheering visit long before&#xD;
that time."&#xD;
"And I shall 1ht g to see you, mint r, as well&#xD;
as all the rest here, but don't think I could sk&#xD;
Mr. Phelps to pare inc again so soon. 'Iy&#xD;

was very inconvenient for hini to let no comn'&#xD;
now ; but he had told father that I shtoid, after a&#xD;
month's trial, come ihonie and let )ou all knou&#xD;
how I was pleased, and he is not a man to break&#xD;
an engagement in even so small a thing. It&#xD;
from what I heard him say to one of the rolde&#xD;
clerks, I am sure he wouldn't approvo of fre-&#xD;
queit visits ; he said success in trade depended&#xD;
more upon a willingness to apply oreselI cli wly.&#xD;
being always found in one's place, than upoua any&#xD;
peculiar shrewdness ; that in this tie must hrlie&#xD;
themselves during their a pprenticeship, if thbey&#xD;
would practice it when they should become prin-&#xD;
cipals in an establishment; so 1 have resolved to&#xD;
deny myself another s isit 'till Christ mas, fory Iu&#xD;

in my business ; besides I wouldn't put N r&#xD;
Phelps, kitid as he is, to t he inconvetietnceeof&#xD;
sparing me again through the hurry ing  asont."&#xD;
"Not until Christmas !' was the exelaintiotin&#xD;
which passed around the little circle, and the&#xD;
tone in which it was spoken told that no one felt&#xD;
over-cheerful at the prospect of so prolonged a&#xD;
separation. But the old grandmother, who was&#xD;
ever ready -with her word of encouragement,&#xD;
wheni she saw one of her chibIren striving at a&#xD;
difficult task, now put all the murmurers to si-&#xD;

TIlE MITHER&#xD;
Poor Delia, her brothers fairly shouted at such&#xD;
a sudden explosion of her nice bit of romance,&#xD;
and she was just on the eve of crying for vexa-&#xD;
tion, when Willie came to her rescue, turning&#xD;
the attention of all from the poor girl.&#xD;
" Oh ! Mr. Phelps, I have a favor to ask ; it&#xD;
would be impossible to bring all our family up&#xD;
here; and wild as my brothers are, father and&#xD;
mother would never consent to their coming to&#xD;
your city home; you might almost as well intro-&#xD;
duce wild colts into your parlors ; but out on our&#xD;
farm, they, with Jack and Billy, would have a&#xD;
chance and plenty of room to cut all the pranks&#xD;
they could without disturbing anybody, or injuring&#xD;
anything, and Delia would enjoy Mamy's company,&#xD;
there as much as here, besides having a chance&#xD;
to hear grandma tell her stories in her old fash-&#xD;
ioned room, which she never can unless she goes,&#xD;
there, for grandma never leaves home. Let&#xD;
them all go home with me for two or three days.&#xD;
I will write to mother that they are coming, and&#xD;
will insure them a hearty welcome, from the oldest'&#xD;
to the youngest member of our family."&#xD;
And now there arose a great discussion, in&#xD;
which the children took no small part; to go&#xD;
they were determined, and in spite of all the ob-&#xD;
jections which could be raised by their parents,&#xD;
they, with Willie's help, won a promise from&#xD;
their mother that, should Mrs. McDonald say she&#xD;
would be willing to see them, they should go,&#xD;
and Willie assured them they had nothing to fear,&#xD;
he knew how cordial would be his mother's in-&#xD;
vitation to the Phelps children to visit the plain&#xD;
old farm home. The time was the next thing to&#xD;
be settled, but that, Mrs. Phelps said, should be&#xD;
left to Wilson's mother, and Delia comforted the&#xD;
boys by the hint that by this arrangement they&#xD;
should probably go sooner than if their mother&#xD;
set the time, for the McDonald faunily would all&#xD;
be in so much of a hurry to see Willie, they would&#xD;
fix the earliest day possible for this journey.&#xD;
Willie wrote home immediately, and the boys&#xD;
declared that the week of waiting for an answer&#xD;
to' his letter would never terminate, and so&#xD;
troublesome were they, never for a minute still,&#xD;
and continually wondering would an answer come&#xD;
at all, and if they should go, what would be the&#xD;
first thing the McDonald boys would say to them,&#xD;
and would they prove such grand play-fellows as&#xD;
they expected, with a thousand other things, un-&#xD;
til their mother wished the matter decided as&#xD;
soon as they could themselves.&#xD;
On the morning of the very earliest day they&#xD;
could, with any reason, look for the arrival of the&#xD;
wished for letter, Willie caine bouniling into the&#xD;
breakfast room, flourishing an open sheet and call-&#xD;
&#xD;
LESS BAIRN.                              51&#xD;
ing upon Jack and Billy to join him in three&#xD;
cheers. This was the letter from Mrs. McDon-&#xD;
ald, and well might her boy be proud of it. She&#xD;
told how happy they were all made by the con-&#xD;
tents of their dear Willie's letter, and begged him&#xD;
to thank Mr. and Mrs. Phelps in hei-'s and his&#xD;
father's name ; it would be such an unexpected&#xD;
happiness to have their family altogether for a&#xD;
whole fortnight, and it would be an increased&#xD;
pleasure to have the younger members of the&#xD;
Phelps family with them; she only wished the&#xD;
parents could accompany their children. She had&#xD;
much to say of the preparations the boys were&#xD;
already making for the reception of their guests,&#xD;
while Mamy and Amy were scarcely behind them,&#xD;
and grandma promised some of her very best sto-&#xD;
ries, and then closed by fixing the beginning of&#xD;
the next week as their time for coming, as the&#xD;
excitement of James' arrival would then have&#xD;
passed, and if possible, she would have them there&#xD;
in time to enjoy those delicious strawberries which&#xD;
were this year unusually fine.&#xD;
This was almost too much for the boys to en-&#xD;
dure,,and Delia too was half wild with excite-&#xD;
ment ;--the beginning of the next week-and&#xD;
now it was Saturd sy.  But Mrs. Phelps soon&#xD;
gave each one to understand there was no time&#xD;
to lose, for her husband and Wilson said Tows-&#xD;
day was the best day for a start and that would&#xD;
leave but two days besides Sunday for the lire-&#xD;
parations. And never' did the sun shine tore&#xD;
beautifully than on that same Tuesday morning,&#xD;
and never did a little party in their bright holi-&#xD;
day smiles seem more perfectly satisfied with&#xD;
their prospect, titan did the one w hich left the&#xD;
handsome Phelps house to take their seats in the&#xD;
cars, which would very quickly bear them to the&#xD;
end of their short journey.&#xD;
Mr. and Mrs. Phelps had no hesitation in&#xD;
entrusting their children to Wilson's care, for al-&#xD;
though he was young, he had gained such ani in-&#xD;
fluence over the boys that he could control them&#xD;
with less difficulty than could their parents, and&#xD;
their high spirited Delia regarded him as suh a&#xD;
perfect oracle of wisdom, it was for her enough j&#xD;
to know that he approved o- disapyroved of liMr&#xD;
actions to make her happy or wretched ; so their 1&#xD;
good byes to the little traveling party were most&#xD;
cheering as the bell rang the moment of departure.&#xD;

THE MITHERLESS BAIRN.&#xD;
&#xD;
This was Mrs. Phelps' good-natured, playful and Jim might make a great ado if they were left&#xD;
charge to Willie and the children, and not a little at home, so the best way was to make them all&#xD;
did it contribute to the real enjoyment of each stay in their places like good children; but you&#xD;

Swiftly the cars flew over the road, and when the two boys Ronald and Archie, each decorating&#xD;
at last they reached the station, which was the a gate post, while Amy, tailing of a loftier perch&#xD;
terminus of the Phelps party's noisy ride, the occupied the top of the gate. But soon they&#xD;
first object which met ,Wilson's eye was his saw the young ones were not alone in their im-&#xD;
father's horses and wagon, and an instant after, patient eagerness for nearly every member of the&#xD;
before the cars had fairly stopped, David's eager McDonald family were upon the porch waiting&#xD;
face was thrust in the door, immediately followed for the arrival of their guests, and no sooner had&#xD;

greeting.  The young man grasped Willie by the Phelps by the reception his family gave him,&#xD;
both hands, and then welcomed his young com- and not only the boys but Delia, too, felt them-&#xD;
panions. The eyes of both the boys sparkled  selves fortunate in being his companions, so dis-&#xD;
with delight, in a moment David was just the fel- tinguished as he seemed by all. Before a half&#xD;

was no lack of gallantry, yet he whispered aside home with their new friends as though they had&#xD;
to his brother-                             known them for years. Jack and Billy were out&#xD;
"And this is the girl whose ears you were to with the McDonald youngsters, taking a survey&#xD;
pull; why didn't you tell us what a witch she of their play ground, and getting a list of the&#xD;

"Ile don't,, eh !-well I do," was David's an-  "And marbles,,you.play marbles, don't you ?"&#xD;

THE MITHERLESS BAIRN.&#xD;
"Not play marbles," cried Jack and Billy in a playfellows-had acquired that fatal passion,&#xD;
breath at this item in country morality. "And which had cost the heart of those who loved him&#xD;
where's the harm in playing marbles I'd like to so many a bitter pang, jpd Jack resolved to tell&#xD;

"Oh! we don't know anything about them any  But while the boys had become acquainted,&#xD;

"But our father wouldn't say a thing lie didn't looked to her the very man of all others to call&#xD;

Archie, who was much more gentle than his round his neck and give him a good hugging as&#xD;
brother, again interfered, saying they would ask she so often did around her own dear father' sat&#xD;
their father to explain where was the harni in this home. And then the boys, in their brown trous-&#xD;

The farmer complied without hesitation, and their mother as coaxingly as they would havoe&#xD;

country youths and maidens, had prepared her to&#xD;
have many a laugh at the expense of the McDon-&#xD;
ailds ; for how young ladies could frequent the&#xD;
kitchen, could delve into all the mysteries con-'&#xD;
nected with cooking, butter-making, and the'&#xD;
like, to say nothing of cow-milking, and still know&#xD;
anything of politeness would have been a mystery&#xD;
to any one of Delia's friends as it was to her;&#xD;
and to see a farmer's son, with his sunburnt&#xD;
cheeks, and hands brown and callous from hard&#xD;
work and exposure, so gentlemanly and self-&#xD;
possessed in his manners-as much at home-&#xD;
when acting the polite as when holding the&#xD;
plough, was a greater mystery still. Delia's city&#xD;
associates, who regarded all country youths as&#xD;
boors, would have wondered, as she did, how two&#xD;
things so incompatible-labor and politeness-&#xD;
could be practiced by any one person with such&#xD;
ease, and a few days spent in the McDonald&#xD;
family would have explained it to them as it did&#xD;
to Delia-that what one is accustomed to from&#xD;
infancy, must ever be practiced with grace-&#xD;
when by sons and brothers, mother and sis-&#xD;
ters are regarded as first and most deserving&#xD;
among all woman kind, of their love and atten-&#xD;
tion every other woman must receive from them&#xD;
that delicate attention which is ever most grati-&#xD;
fying to a true womanly heart. Delia was yet'&#xD;
too young to arrange her newly acquired ideas,&#xD;
yet had they been brought into shape, they would&#xD;
have differed very little from the foregoing con-&#xD;
clusion, and not in years-no, not in her whole&#xD;
life did she forget this most delightful lesson ac-&#xD;
quired from this first visit in a farmer's home.&#xD;

genius, and where by one of her most entertain-&#xD;

spirits of the younger portion of the family into&#xD;
a most quiet listening mood. Even her own&#xD;
children, who had spent so manydelightful hours&#xD;
listening to her never failing stories, listened this&#xD;
evening with an interest they had seldom felt,&#xD;
and Delia thought it was no wonder this family&#xD;
were happy, the possessors, as they were, of&#xD;
such a living story book; and at last she settled&#xD;
the question which had greatly puzzled her, that&#xD;
could she choose from the treasures of this home&#xD;
which would she take ? Grandma was certainly&#xD;
the one most to be coveted, and long after she was&#xD;
in bed she was livig over the events of the day-&#xD;
the most delightful day that in all her short life&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
she could remember having spent. She would&#xD;
have said before this, that a man must lose his&#xD;
importance if he would condescend to mingle&#xD;
with children in their sports, yet when had she&#xD;
ever seen a father more respected by his children&#xD;
than was this farmer, who had entered with such&#xD;
real enjoyment into the amusements of the day-&#xD;
and mother and grand-mother, although they gave&#xD;
themselves up so entirely to the amusing of their&#xD;
children, not hesitating to play to perfection the&#xD;
part assigned them, not for a moment did even&#xD;
the wild Archie or Ronald' lose sight of that&#xD;
deferential love which characterized their man-&#xD;
ner towards these two.&#xD;
Delia had seen this, yet it was one thing, she&#xD;
could not quite understand; with girls she would&#xD;
not have been surprised perhaps that such man-&#xD;
agement should work well; but with harum sea-&#xD;
rum boys-that was what puzzled her, and yet&#xD;
she had not failed to observe that her own not&#xD;
over civil brothers had never behaved with such&#xD;
praiseworthy propriety as on this evening.&#xD;
The cause of this might have puzzled older&#xD;
heads than Delia's, for very few parents learn in&#xD;
the whole course of training their children the&#xD;
thousand opportunities they let slip of improving&#xD;
and influencing those so dear to them, to say&#xD;
nothing of giving them greater enjoyment -and&#xD;
securing to themselves a greater-by neglecting&#xD;
to mingle with and assist them in their childish&#xD;
pleasures. They seem not to realise that as a&#xD;
child behaves in the play ground or in the play&#xD;
room towards his or her associates, so, with&#xD;
scarcely an exception, must they act towards&#xD;
those with whom they come in contact when they&#xD;
shall come to fill the position of men and women,&#xD;
and in this great school for forming not only&#xD;
mind and manner, but heart too, these tender un-&#xD;
trained beings are left without a guide; and&#xD;
who canwonder, that the end is too often soul&#xD;
sickening-may we not rather wonder that any&#xD;
escape the polluting touch of vice? When wo-&#xD;
men. and men, too, learn that the most noble&#xD;
thing they can do in this bfe is to watch over&#xD;
with tenderness and wisdom that richest gift&#xD;
which heaven can bestow upon earth's children-&#xD;
their offspring-when in their griefs, their studies,&#xD;
their amusements they come to join as sympa-&#xD;
thizers, helpers, and participators, then and only&#xD;
then must there be a falling off from dram shops&#xD;
and gambling houses, and then may we hope to&#xD;
have penitentiaries and poor houses unoccupied.&#xD;
But Delia's thoughts were nothing of the sort,&#xD;
but such as, under the circumstances, might have&#xD;
occupied any otherflfteen year old girl-wishing&#xD;
that her own dear mother did not so easily tire of&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MITHERLESS BAIRN.&#xD;
&#xD;
talking with her, of answering her questions and&#xD;
assisting her in her studies, and that for once in&#xD;
her life she could see both her parents playing&#xD;
the child, as she had seen it played by the digni-&#xD;
fied farmer and his wife on this delightful even-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
During their three days' stay, there was no&#xD;
falling off of enjoyment with these city children,&#xD;
but when Saturday morning arrived, and Wilson&#xD;
told them they must, during the forenoon, take&#xD;
their last draught of country enjoyment, for at&#xD;
noon they were to take the cars home, which was&#xD;
in accordance with their mother's wish, no one&#xD;
uttered a word of murmuring ; in truth, they&#xD;
looked to the going home with anticipated pleas-&#xD;
ure-their visit had been so delightful, so full of&#xD;
novelties, would there not be enough to talk&#xD;
about for- a whole week ?&#xD;
When Wilson prepared to accompany them to&#xD;
the city, they all begged of him to send them&#xD;
alone and not for their sakes deprive himself of a&#xD;
half day of his delightful fortnight at home. The&#xD;
youth was much gratified by this unexpected&#xD;
thoughtfulness on the part of the boys, but he had&#xD;
no chance to thank them, for David broke in up-&#xD;
on their couheil, making the declaration that he&#xD;
had made up an independent etrawberrying par-&#xD;
ty-as yet, it was composed of hhnself alone, but&#xD;
volunteers would be received with equal pleas-&#xD;
ure. And not many minutes was it before the&#xD;
gay young farmer had the satisfaction of piling&#xD;
brothers, sisters and guests all into the lumber&#xD;
wagon, for weie they to walk, he said, nobody&#xD;
would do anything but eat as fast as they should&#xD;
gather the berries when they reached the mea-&#xD;
dow, and his object in the expedition was quite&#xD;
a different one. He wished to give the mother of&#xD;
their young visiters a taste of their country luxu-&#xD;
ries; the berries they should gather were to be&#xD;
his offering to Mrs. Phelps, and until their largest&#xD;
basket was filled, no one of the company was to&#xD;
be allowed to regale him or herself with even a&#xD;
single taste, no matter how tempting they might&#xD;
be.&#xD;
Delia and her brothers were too much grati&#xD;
fled with this arrangement, not to practise this&#xD;
self-denial while with the rest. David was look-&#xD;
ed upon as having a right to direct, being chief&#xD;
originator of the party, so no one thought of act-&#xD;
ing contrary to his commands; but formidable as&#xD;
was the designated basket for size, with such a&#xD;
numerous party and berries so plentiful, not a&#xD;
very long time was consumed in filling it to the&#xD;
brim, and then Delia and Amy went on heaping&#xD;
it up with the most beautiful clusters they could&#xD;
select, until there was not room for another one ;&#xD;
&#xD;
59&#xD;
&#xD;
then there came the closing up merry making&#xD;
time, in which all joined right gleefully, and it&#xD;
was only broken off by Willie reminding them&#xD;
that they were to get back home for lunch, and&#xD;
then there would be no more than time for their&#xD;
travelers to reach the village before car time.&#xD;
They found Mrs. McDonald waiting their re-&#xD;
turn with table spread ; and the mingled perfume&#xD;
of coffee and short cake told she had not firgot-&#xD;
ten her part of the engagement. Mary and Amy&#xD;
assisted by Delia, soon had a sufficiency of ber-&#xD;
ries prepared to fill the rich, smoking short cake,&#xD;
and as it was placed upon the table, floating in&#xD;
delicious cream and juice, the rustic party ac-&#xD;
knowledged themselves fully prepared to test its&#xD;
merits, by gathering around the table in the most&#xD;
unceremonious manner, for all having been pre-&#xD;
pared for them they felt themselves at liberty to&#xD;
dispense with all order.&#xD;
To David's appeal, if, after all, the country&#xD;
was not much to be preferred to the city--especial-&#xD;
ly country lunches to city lunches-Delia, like a&#xD;
cautious child, answered,&#xD;
"If all of the country was like what she had&#xD;
seen, and all the city what it appeared to her,&#xD;
surely the country must be the best beyond com-&#xD;
parison. But to her all seemed too fairy-like to&#xD;
last; she was not convinced of its reality yet."a&#xD;
" But don't we seem a remarkably robust race&#xD;
of fairies, Delia? The way we've all pitched&#xD;
into that stock of strawberry short cake would&#xD;
seem to ine sufficient to convince you of our tan-&#xD;
gibility. Fairy-like, you call this do you? Well&#xD;
if we don't have real life and real enjoyment here,&#xD;
I don't know where you will find it!"&#xD;
"That is what made me say it seems like&#xD;
fairy-land, for you know we think that the nicest&#xD;
place in the world ! you all look so kind and&#xD;
happy here, you would make every one else sa.&#xD;
I don't believe I was ever so long a time without&#xD;
feeling a little cross, and Jack and Billy have&#xD;
been se different from what they are at home-&#xD;
Willie will tell you so," she added, as they ill&#xD;
laughed at her frank way of speaking of herself&#xD;
and brothers.&#xD;
" And do you bring this up as an argument&#xD;
against the country, Delia ?"  asked  David&#xD;
roguishly.&#xD;
" Oh ! no, you know I do not"-was the girl's&#xD;
answer, not seeming to notice that the youth was&#xD;
laughing at her-"but all has been too pleasant&#xD;
to last-that was why I pronounced it unreal !"&#xD;
"But I can testify that it has lasted these nine-&#xD;
teen years, Delia, and if that is'nt sufficient, that&#xD;
youngster at your side will tell you he has grown&#xD;
to maii's estate-for lie plumes himself on his one0&#xD;

60                    THE MITHERLESS BAIRN.&#xD;
&#xD;
-h&#xD;
&#xD;
The flash of thoughtfulness, which for a mo-&#xD;
ment was stealing over all the company, flitted&#xD;
before this boyish speech, and all laughed at the&#xD;
lad's thorough appreciation of their repast, quite&#xD;
forgetful of David's unusually serious moods.&#xD;
The Phelps children were accompanied by all&#xD;
the younger McDonalds, as well as by David and&#xD;
Willie ; James alone being left out of the com-&#xD;
pany. The good byes of Mr. and Mrs. McDonald&#xD;
and grandma were such as their visit had given&#xD;
them reason to expect, and the invitation from all&#xD;
three to repeat the visit in the fall, when the nuts&#xD;
were in their most inviting mood, asking, as the&#xD;
farmer said, to be gathered, filled all their young,&#xD;
heads with the brightest imaginable dreams of&#xD;
another delightful time. And then such pleasant&#xD;
messages as they had for their parents, not only&#xD;
to allow their children to come to them, but to&#xD;
come themselves and get a taste of the country&#xD;
life ; all this convinced the Phelps party that&#xD;
never before were there people, so good and&#xD;
thoughtful of children as Mr. McDonald, his wife,&#xD;
and that charming grandmother.&#xD;
Their ride to the village in the lumber wagon&#xD;
was all taken up in plans for the McDonalds to&#xD;
come to them, and have a taste of sight-seeing.&#xD;
The boys felt particularly how little they had to&#xD;
offer in the way of entertainment to their young&#xD;
friends, but then they would do the best they&#xD;
could, and at least they could talk over all that&#xD;
had been so nice during their stay in the coun-&#xD;
try. But to Archie and Ronald it looked a very&#xD;
different thing-a visit to the city would be a&#xD;
&#xD;
for this gentle, cheerful mother seemed much the&#xD;
same she had ever been, was always in her&#xD;
place among her children, and to their natural'&#xD;
inquiries after her health, the answer was what&#xD;
it had ever been " very well !" But Wilson was&#xD;
not to be decived, and as his visit came near its&#xD;
close, his close watching of every movement had&#xD;
convinced him all was not right, and he resolved&#xD;
to tell his kindest of mothers what were his&#xD;
fears, and find if they had any foundation.&#xD;
Not until the evening before he must return to&#xD;
the city did he find a favorable opportunity to&#xD;
speak freely with the object of his solicitude. Mr.&#xD;
McDonald being engaged with a neighbor, who&#xD;
had called to spend an hour or two, and the chil-&#xD;
dren wholly occupied with a game in the garden,&#xD;
while James and David were absorbed in listen-&#xD;
ing to Mary's reading of an interesting book,&#xD;
there seemed little danger of his being disturbed&#xD;
by any of them, if he sought the mother's roi-&#xD;
where at twilight, she was nearly always to be&#xD;
found. As Wilson approached the door, which&#xD;
was ajar, he saw the occupant of the room sit-&#xD;
ing by the window, her head bowed, and her thin&#xD;
face partially concealed by one hand, upon vxhich&#xD;
her forehead was resting ; by the twilight that&#xD;
face looked paler and thinner than he had ever&#xD;
seen it, and the expression upon it was that of&#xD;
exceeding sadness. For a moment he hesitated,&#xD;
feeling he hardly had a right to disturb her reflec-&#xD;
tions ; then his anxiety, which was not at all les-&#xD;
sened by her look, gave him courage, and his gen.&#xD;
tle tap upon the door made her start quickly and&#xD;
&#xD;
and twenty years-and in all that time our home wonderful event-but they-had little hope of its&#xD;
has been as you see it now!"     .being realized very soon, and told their friends as&#xD;
" That is not what I was doubting," was De- much. The time they would have in the fall,&#xD;
lia's thoughtful answer, "but could anybody else gathering nuts-David taking it upon himself&#xD;
make the country what you do here ? I don't to picture to Delia all the pleasure citnuect-&#xD;
know, but I have thought you would make a home ed with it-and so their ride and their visit ended&#xD;
in the city a very nice place ! That it wasn't so with the most cordial good byes and cheering a -&#xD;
much the difference between country and city, as ticipation of a delightful time in the comniog au&#xD;
between you all here and everybody I'd ever seen tumn.&#xD;
before."                                      The remainder of Wilson's home-stay piased&#xD;
The speaker was by far too serious for her lis, with much of quiet enjoyment, yet once or twice&#xD;
teners to wish to laugh at her frank way of coin- the boy had detecte u a look in his other's face&#xD;
plimenting them ; and of one thing David, with his that troubled him-it carried him back to a time&#xD;
devoted love for the country wis satisfied, thatthis past, when within a very narrow and scantily&#xD;
bright spirited city girl fully appreciated their furnished chamber, he had acted the part of&#xD;
home, and his answer that he had never thought housekeeper and nurse to a fading, dying mother-&#xD;
of this-may be it was grandma, parents, broth- it carried him even further back than that, to the&#xD;
ers and sisters, which made everything pass off time when that mother had striven to conceal the&#xD;
so splendidly.             -                failing of her strength from her poor child, when&#xD;
"And strawberry short-cake," broke in Jack, she had stifled the sharp cough, and suppressed&#xD;
"if Billie and I could always have strawberry the sigh which would arise, as she thought of&#xD;
short-cake and such coffee for lunch, I guess we'd the future. The cause of this strange associas-&#xD;

there was an effort at cheerfulness as she said:  resting upon his shoulder. In her miannir there&#xD;

"You are not displeased that I came to you, my pinion's answer made his heart sikeiiwith an-&#xD;

THE MITHEIRLESS BAIRN.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHATER IX.&#xD;
"Our very hopes belied our fears,&#xD;
our fears our hopes belied.&#xD;
We thought h,.r dying when she slept,&#xD;
And sleeping when she died. HooD.&#xD;
To a disinterested looker on, Mrs. McDonald's&#xD;
fears might have seemed almost groundless. For&#xD;
many weeks, even months, she kept her place in&#xD;
her family, as was her wont, and then, little by&#xD;
little, this careful wife and mother was compelled&#xD;
to yield to her growing feebleness-to give up to&#xD;
less practiced hands t ose little duties she had&#xD;
so delighted in, until ere she, or those who loved&#xD;
her so truly were hardly conscious of it, the ac-&#xD;
tive housewife, was completely lost in- the con-&#xD;
firmed invalid.&#xD;
April found her able to do little more than&#xD;
walk with great difficulty from her bed to the&#xD;
easy chair in which she found relief front her&#xD;
weariness ; but still the family had not yet arous-&#xD;
ed to a consciousness of the sorrow which was&#xD;
overshadowing them, the summer they thought&#xD;
would bring with it strength for that feeble one,&#xD;
and the smile, with which the sufferer heard&#xD;
these hopeful words, reassured their anxious&#xD;
hearts. But in all this time Mrs. McDonald had&#xD;
found much real comfort and strength in unbur-&#xD;
thening her tried soul to the child of her adop-&#xD;
tion ; no pain was concealed from him, and had&#xD;
she not known him so well, she might have be-&#xD;
lieved that the steady cheerfulness he was ever&#xD;
able to preserve in the presence of the other&#xD;
members of the family, and the quiet comfort&#xD;
he could ever speak to her when they were alone,&#xD;
came from indifference; but the long years, dur-&#xD;
ing which they had lived in that closest relation&#xD;
as other and child, had given her a thorough&#xD;
knowledge of the strength of Wilson's love for&#xD;
her; yet one thing she had not learned, and there&#xD;
seemed little chance of her ever finding it out-&#xD;
the strength of that boy heart, its ability to for-&#xD;
get self in comforting those who were dear to&#xD;
it-or if not forget-to suppress the cry which&#xD;
his agonized soul was struggling to utter, and&#xD;
instead to whisper calm loving words of comf rt.&#xD;
Could this mother have had Wilson with her&#xD;
constantly, it would have served greatly to les-&#xD;
sen the weariness attending this gradual wearing&#xD;
out; but this she would not ask, for with his em-&#xD;
ployer he had grown to be a most t ffieient clerk,&#xD;
not only on account of his activity, but for the&#xD;
studied care he had ever shown in all that he had&#xD;
lain his hand to. Mr. Phelps had gained the&#xD;
greatest confidence in him, and often intrusted&#xD;
him with commissions, or talked with him on-&#xD;
business matters in a way he would not have&#xD;
done with his oldest and most reliable clerks.&#xD;
&#xD;
Knowing all this Mrs. McDonald would not have&#xD;
consented to Wilson's futtire prospects being sa-&#xD;
crificed to gratify her, for in all probability, when&#xD;
the boy should reach his majority, if not before,&#xD;
he would be entered as partner in the large mer-&#xD;
cantile establishment; and she looked upon his&#xD;
unequalled success, which she well knew was&#xD;
owing to his own honest and active service, with&#xD;
all a mother's pride-but in this pride how much&#xD;
was-there of sadness.&#xD;
When others, to whom he was dear, should be&#xD;
looking upon the prosperity of not only this child,&#xD;
butherother children,when they should rejoice to-&#xD;
gether over the good things life might bring, or per-&#xD;
chance weep together over the sorrows which&#xD;
might lay before them-she should be beyond all.&#xD;
sorrow or joy, so far as earth and her dear ones&#xD;
were tosbe thought of-should be'still and silent in&#xD;
the grave, that resting place, seeming to mortal&#xD;
mind, colder and more dismal the more nearly ap-&#xD;
proached, and which, so long as an heart-tie re-&#xD;
mains in life, no Christian faith can rob of its&#xD;
gloom,     .&#xD;
Mr. Phelps had heard from Wilson of his moth-&#xD;
er's feeble health, and without being asked, had&#xD;
granted him a two days' visit home each month.&#xD;
This was indeed a great kindness, and not only&#xD;
the boy, but Mrs. McDonald felt it so, and neither&#xD;
one thought of asking more, yet the separations al-&#xD;
.ways cost them both a pang, for when Wilson was&#xD;
gone the invalid must shut her secret within her&#xD;
own heart, and very often her mournful thoughts&#xD;
would become almost unbearable. Yetoften as she&#xD;
tried to break the sad truth to her husband and&#xD;
children, her courage would always fail her, and&#xD;
when the words were almost spoken, again they&#xD;
would be recalled. Thus shut out from opening&#xD;
her heart to all the others, was it strange that&#xD;
this sinking woman had grown to lean so confid-&#xD;
ingly upon the boy, who despite the absence of a&#xD;
natural tie, had gained a child's place in the&#xD;
motherly heart.&#xD;
"Good-bye, mother, I must go now, but Mr.&#xD;
Phelps told me I should come to stay a long two&#xD;
weeks with you as soon as we should complete&#xD;
the invoice of the stock now preparing for be-&#xD;
ing shipped.-Two weeks !-how much I shall&#xD;
enjoy such a long visit !"&#xD;
Wilson took the thin white handle of his mother&#xD;
within his own as he said this, and his words&#xD;
were spoken in a very cheerful tone, for David&#xD;
was standing by waiting to have the good-byes&#xD;
over that he could take his brother to the depot;&#xD;
and Mary, the quiet, thoughtful girl, sat close at&#xD;
her mother's side closely occupied with her sew-&#xD;
ing ; yet her mind was never so much absorbed&#xD;

I'&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MITHERLESS BAIRN.&#xD;
&#xD;
in labor of any kind, that she had not an ear for&#xD;
what was spoken by her worshipped mother; this&#xD;
Wilson well knew, and had assumed a manner so&#xD;
foreign to his real feelings, for his last two or&#xD;
three home visits had shown the object of his&#xD;
anxiety declining much more rapidly than at any&#xD;
time before, and from all that he had heard of&#xD;
the progress of this stealthy disease, the very&#xD;
symptoms over which all felt so rejoiced-the ab-&#xD;
sence of pain-was the one which spoke the most&#xD;
plainly of a rapid dissolution. Convinced of all&#xD;
this, it was not -pos-ible for him to think of a&#xD;
home visit two or three weeks hence with other&#xD;
than a sad heart, sometimes it was with heart-&#xD;
rending forebodings, yet for the sake of all those&#xD;
dearer 'than his own life he could hide&#xD;
this, and seem happy as in the days when all had&#xD;
been sunshine.&#xD;
Mrs. McDonald found it less easy to assume&#xD;
what she so little felt, and her tone was really&#xD;
mournful in which she said:&#xD;
"Mr. Phelps is very kind, Willie-very thought-&#xD;
ful-but how long before this business will be&#xD;
done with-not too long I hope''&#xD;
"Not more than three weeks, dear mother;&#xD;
that will be soon gone, and I shall then have more&#xD;
than a chance to say 'how do you do,' before the&#xD;
'good bye'must come."&#xD;
"And three weeks are longer than two, Willie;&#xD;
it looks very long to me, for there may come&#xD;
much suffering and sorrow in that time"-the&#xD;
voice was choked with emotion.&#xD;
Mary arose quickly and came to her mother;&#xD;
her young face was troubled, and the hand which&#xD;
she laid upon her parent's forehead was cold from&#xD;
nervousness; but she made no attempt to speak&#xD;
save with her sorrowful eyes, which told her fos-&#xD;
ter brother the truth was dawning upon her ; as&#xD;
to David, he could see no reason for such gloomy&#xD;
apprehensions; full of health and vigor, and hope&#xD;
himself, life must look very fair, and his manner&#xD;
was very gay as he said:&#xD;
"Tut, tut ! mother, nervous are you! This be-&#xD;
ing cooped up here is too much for almost any-&#xD;
body, but who would have thought of your going&#xD;
out? Come, now, cheer up, the sun is warm to-&#xD;
day; in ihree or four days we shan't be afraid to&#xD;
take you out, and then you'll get strong, and&#xD;
these cheeks will grow like themselves again."&#xD;
He patted one of her cheeks playfully as he said&#xD;
this, but neither his words or manner had any&#xD;
power to cheer her heart or even to awaken a&#xD;
shown of cheerfulness.&#xD;
These cheeks will never be more like themselves&#xD;
than you see them now, Davie; you may take&#xD;
me out, but the change will bring no strength to&#xD;
&#xD;
63&#xD;
&#xD;
my wasted limbs. No,you need not look doubt-&#xD;
ful, my dear boy, I am not nervous-as you Say-&#xD;
but I know my life is almost spent, I have ft It it&#xD;
for a long time going from me very gradually, but&#xD;
very surely; but now that I have so little way to&#xD;
travel ere I come to the end, it seems to mue I un&#xD;
speeding over it so swiftly-yes, too swiftly, for&#xD;
even feeble as I am, there is a pleasure in staying&#xD;
with you all-there, there my darling, my poor&#xD;
Mary, hush! now I would not have spoken yet,&#xD;
but I have put it off as long as I dare ;-dt't&#xD;
cry so bitterly, my child."&#xD;
Mary had sunk upon her knees by her moth-&#xD;
er's side, and with her head bowed upon the ari&#xD;
of the chair, she was weeping as one nearly be-&#xD;
reft of hope; her sobs were not loud but deep and&#xD;
passionate. Her mother's words and caresses&#xD;
had little power to soothe her, but only brought&#xD;
home to that young heart-before untried in sor-&#xD;
rdw-the conviction that she soon should be left&#xD;
motherless! motherless !!&#xD;
As to the happy light-hearted David, there&#xD;
seemed something in the words of his other&#xD;
which bewildered him; his manner was as ore&#xD;
who did not comprehend, but with one hand&#xD;
upon his brow he stood half bending over the&#xD;
speaker, his eyes fixed upon that loved face as&#xD;
though he would read her very heart and know&#xD;
all its sad secrets; after a moment spent in trypnig&#xD;
to soothe Mary, the mother went on,&#xD;
"I have shut this in my heart very long, none&#xD;
but Willie, our faithful Willie-has fathtmed toy&#xD;
secret; and not even now  would I have spoken&#xD;
had all my children been with me ; but the 1.h au&#xD;
few days have told me, that what you have all&#xD;
hoped so much from the warm sunshine andtitm&#xD;
mer air will but hasten the day of sorrow ; ny&#xD;
strength has gone much more rapidly during the&#xD;
last two days, than in a whole week before, and&#xD;
I can't be blinded to my fate  Biut, David, I muiit&#xD;
see your brother-I must see my first-born, be foi&#xD;
[ die ; but before he can be sent for, your father&#xD;
must be told of this; oh ! my children, how can I&#xD;
bear to rend his heart, so peaceful, so happy as&#xD;
have been our lives-so tender as he has ever&#xD;
been, how can I lookt upoin his agony ; and yet hi&#xD;
must know it-very soon, even it' I seal my lips,&#xD;
he will learn all in the saddest, saddest way."&#xD;
"IHush, mother, don't let a thought of it'e&#xD;
who-are well and strong-who are so well able&#xD;
to bear, compared with you-overcome you so&#xD;
much. We are all helped in our grief-we are&#xD;
all given strength according to our affliction."&#xD;
Willie said this in such a low soothing voice,&#xD;
it could not fail to calm the mother's agitation&#xD;
&#xD;

somewhat. When she seemed a little more quiet&#xD;
he went on:&#xD;
"Mother, shall I talk to father ?  I know he&#xD;
has many fears, yet he believes you will be spar-&#xD;
ed to us; it is hard for any of us to believe in the&#xD;
coming of a first grief, we think som thing will&#xD;
turn the destroyer from our doors, yet for all this&#xD;
our circles are broken. Mother, shall I wait un-&#xD;
til evening, and save you as much as I may from&#xD;
this trial?"&#xD;
Wilson spoke with much feeling, and much&#xD;
more like a full grown man than a youth of seven-&#xD;
teen years. The answer was almost a wail of&#xD;
sorrow.&#xD;
" Do, Willie-arid, oh! do not go until this is&#xD;
over. My poor David, my poor husband! but&#xD;
for this I could endure the trial."&#xD;
All three of the children seemed overcome by&#xD;
the scene. David, who until this moment had&#xD;
kept his half bent position, now sank into a chair&#xD;
and burying his face in his hands, the poor fel-&#xD;
low groaned aloud. Wilson alone had even the&#xD;
appearance of composure, but even he dared not&#xD;
venture the first word for some moments. When&#xD;
at length he felt his voice might be trusted, he&#xD;
said&#xD;
"Now, dear mother, for your own sake as&#xD;
well as ours, and mother, for father's sake you&#xD;
must lie down, you must get quiet, for (ne that&#xD;
is strong soon sinks under such agitation-and&#xD;
you know how very little you can endure. You&#xD;
would stay with us for a while, dearest mother ;&#xD;
I know how you long to see our brother, but you&#xD;
must be caretul of your strength-the little you&#xD;
have must be used with great caution, . or it&#xD;
won't hold out."&#xD;
While he was saying this the boy passed his&#xD;
hand over the brow and down the side of the&#xD;
mother's face in the most gentle loving way ;&#xD;
that touch told how much of love there was in&#xD;
his heart for the sufferer, although he could so&#xD;
entirely lose sight of his own share in the grief,&#xD;
it was not that his share was a small one, but&#xD;
that he loved this mother, so unselfishly. After&#xD;
a little the invalid laid her head back in her&#xD;
chair, and closed her eyes as if to rest, Wilson&#xD;
went quietly to his brother's side, and laying his&#xD;
hand upon his shoulder he said in a low voice,&#xD;
"David, my poor brother, come; we must not&#xD;
think of our part in this sorrow-for father's and&#xD;
mother's sakes let us not seem to grieve! "&#xD;
"Seem not to grieve!" exclaimed David with&#xD;
vehemence--"seem not to grieve!! and can you&#xD;
who have shared our home and her love say that,&#xD;
Willie; seem not to grieve! Oh, yes, I can see&#xD;
it is not with you as was she your mother; but,&#xD;
&#xD;
Wilson, can't you recall the time when it was&#xD;
your own mother who was going, and then can&#xD;
you not pity me?"&#xD;
The young man spoke almost bitterly, but his&#xD;
words seemed to have no other effect upon him&#xD;
to whom they were addressed, than to excite his&#xD;
alarm lest they should agitate their mother.&#xD;
"Hush, hush, my poor fellow; yes, I do pity&#xD;
you, and David I know how to pity one who&#xD;
suffers, but mother must be quiet now; let us go&#xD;
out and leave her to Mamy's care, and may be she&#xD;
will get a little sleep; we can trust her with&#xD;
Matny-comne, Davie, will you not come with me?"&#xD;
ie spoke in such a kind, persuasive tone, the&#xD;
yoang man arose to go with him.&#xD;
"Yes, go with him, my poor Davie," said&#xD;
Mrs. McDonild, in a voice much calmer than&#xD;
when she had last spoken. "If you could know&#xD;
all that he has been to me, you would not say&#xD;
again what you just now said-though you are&#xD;
right he has none of my weakness of heart-he&#xD;
is not my child by the flesh, nor is he your&#xD;
brother, but by the love he bears us he is ours&#xD;
doubly. Oh, so truly ours-he will make you&#xD;
stronger as he has made me; listen to him, my boy,&#xD;
and he will teach you submission as he has&#xD;
taught it to me, and if you can follow the ex-&#xD;
ample he sets us all-though this is very hard-you&#xD;
will be a living comfort to all you hold dear!&#xD;
Little did I dream on that Christmas day, so many&#xD;
years ago, when your father brought him a home-&#xD;
less, motherless, child to our house, that he could&#xD;
prove to us such a blessing. Go with him, Davie ;&#xD;
kiss me first and then go away; he will do you&#xD;
good, besides I would have some rest. Willie is&#xD;
right. I must be very careful of my remaining&#xD;
strength would I stay until James can arrive."&#xD;
David had no voice to reply, to him this was&#xD;
a, fearful shock, so sudden he scarcely knew&#xD;
whether he waked or slept. One kiss he press-&#xD;
upon those colorless lips and then followed Wilson&#xD;
from the room. As to Maryher adopted brother&#xD;
had.been right in what he had said of her, their&#xD;
mother was to be trusted in her care. No sooner&#xD;
were the two left alone, than the young girl&#xD;
raised her head, revealing her thin face sorrow&#xD;
stamped, but still wearing the expression of de-&#xD;
termined calmness. Although the child had sob-&#xD;
bed so heavily, there were no traces of tears upon&#xD;
her cheeks, and her eyes in their sorrowful look&#xD;
the mother thought larger and clearer than she&#xD;
had ever before seen them.&#xD;
" I will lay down, my child-place the pillows&#xD;
very high, for I find it difficult to breathe; I would&#xD;
get rested for I am tired, and your father will be&#xD;
in soon."&#xD;

in a minute you will be accustomed to it so you&#xD;
can see clearly. She is so white, Willie; I must&#xD;
arouse her; I can't endure to look upon that face&#xD;
so much as though it would never move again."&#xD;
While she was speaking her companion ap-&#xD;
proached nearer the sleeper; there was some-&#xD;
thing in the very attitude which alarmed him;&#xD;
his hand was laid upon one of those colorless as&#xD;
marble, and as quickly withdrawn--it was cold&#xD;
and lifeless as clay. Mary saw the movement and&#xD;
one look into Wilson's face confirmed her fears-..&#xD;
she knew that she-that they were motherless.&#xD;
But where death had stolen in so quietly, was it&#xD;
not meet that the mourning should be of a quiet&#xD;
nature?&#xD;
In that moment this young girl feIt her heart&#xD;
crushed, yet she uttered no moan, she breathed&#xD;
no complaint; and how well that other mourner&#xD;
remembered the time when niore than nine years&#xD;

was to her only child-how he looked up to her&#xD;
as a second self; and it was not strange that her&#xD;
old heart's fibres had wound themselves about&#xD;
this younger one so closely. That now when&#xD;
they were torn away she almost longed for death&#xD;
to free her from a life whieh seemed all so deso-&#xD;
late. Yet there might be something for her to&#xD;
do-this stricken family might now require the&#xD;
aid of these old hands which had so long appear-&#xD;
ed so useless, and she prayed for patience to en-&#xD;
dure, if yet there was the smallest thing remain-&#xD;
ing for her to accomplish in life.&#xD;
To farmer McDonald the shock was overpow-&#xD;
ering. He had looked upon the frail, delicate&#xD;
wife ns a part of himself, and although for months&#xD;
she had been so very feeble, the thought had nev-&#xD;
er for a moment been entertained that he was to&#xD;
yield her up to the destroy ing angel; and had&#xD;

ed uron God for strength and wisdom to aid him;&#xD;
but now, when he most needed Divine support, he&#xD;
sank down upon his own weakness, forgetting&#xD;
that the hand which had been outstretched to&#xD;
afflict could also pour the soothing balm into the&#xD;
bleeding heart.&#xD;
There was one other pair of eyes in that house-&#xD;
hold unvisited by sleep-that aged mother's,&#xD;
dimmed by nearly four score years ; yet they were&#xD;
not too old to watch when a child-her only one&#xD;
was wrestling in such sore agony ; but she knew&#xD;
well his was not a grief to be reached by hurin&#xD;
comfort, and christian-like she used her only&#xD;
available means, prayer; but tramp, tramp, sound-&#xD;
ed the mourner's step save when for a momiient&#xD;
he would pause by the bed of death to gaze upon&#xD;
all that remwaied to him of what he liad so&#xD;
fondly worshipped ; and day brought with it&#xD;
no change.&#xD;
The funeral was like many another one. The&#xD;
dead was laid away to rest until that great di)&#xD;
of awxxakeninig, and many a curious looker on pro-&#xD;
nounced the children almost heartless that they&#xD;
could witness the burial of such a mother wit i&#xD;
such hushed grievings. Little did they dream,&#xD;
that for the time their grief for the dead was al-&#xD;
most forgotten, or at least for the moment cast&#xD;
aside in their anxiety for~ the liig ; so it was&#xD;
with the elder ones, and the younger, as is so&#xD;
natural, followed the example set therem-simoth-&#xD;
ering their sobs which swelled their childish&#xD;
hearts.&#xD;
Not until the second day after the funeral did&#xD;
Wilson feel it possible to tear himself from his,&#xD;
home to return to the cty. A messenger had&#xD;
been sent to Mr. Phelps, the afternoon following&#xD;
Mrs. McDonald's death, to tell hun of the cause&#xD;
of the youth's detention, and the answer which&#xD;
die merchant had returned was most expressive&#xD;
of sympathy ; yet ha could expect, in such a&#xD;
busy time, a business man-no matter how kind&#xD;
hearted-would think it unreasonable that too&#xD;
much time should be consumned in abandon-&#xD;
ed  grieving; and Wilson's better judgment&#xD;
told him that, instead of doing them good,&#xD;
this silent sympathy was creating a morbid&#xD;
melancholy within all their minds, and this&#xD;
diversion might do them much service ; for not&#xD;
only Mary and David, but the younger children,&#xD;
cried out against his leaving them at such a time,&#xD;
and even Mr. McDonald and his mother raised&#xD;
a faint remonstrance, when they heard of his de-&#xD;
termination to go back to his employer. The&#xD;
farmer seemed surprised that any one should&#xD;
tbink of business ; ho had felt this was a death&#xD;
which should drape the whole world in mourn-&#xD;

The speaker's manner was excited, and his u&#xD;
companion thought his determination would have u&#xD;
been very commendable it shown in some other li&#xD;
cause.                                      h&#xD;
" You surprise me, Mr.Farnham, in taking such&#xD;
a decided stand in this case; matters of thiskind t&#xD;
you have ever before left to me entirely, and now&#xD;
you seem more than half inclined not to give me j&#xD;
even a voice in deciding as to the guilt or inno- j&#xD;
cence of this boy, who, let him be what he mayc&#xD;
now, I shall ever believe care to me with an s&#xD;
honest heart."&#xD;
"It may be to you surprising, Mr. Phelps, that t&#xD;
I ever presume 'to have a voice in my own af-&#xD;
fairs"-the manner was cold and expressive of,&#xD;
displeasure-"but although I have interfered so E&#xD;
little since we were associated, I don't consider&#xD;
that this non-interference has annulled my rightI&#xD;
to Epeak, when I see a want of sober judgment&#xD;
in the conducting of the affairs; you must excuse&#xD;
rue for saying this, but you are guilty of a womanly&#xD;
weakness, so far as this youth is concerned. I&#xD;
am the last one to be over-severe, but our inter-&#xD;
ests are endangered by allowing him to remain in&#xD;
his place, and justice demands that such a thing&#xD;
should not be passed over without attention; if&#xD;
we forego a public investigation, we certainly&#xD;
should not a private. In consideration of his ex-&#xD;
treme youth, an i his family-w.hich you say are&#xD;
very respectable-I am inclined to allow justice&#xD;
to yield much to mercy; but he must know this is&#xD;
all discovered!&#xD;
For a few moments Mr. Phelps remained silent&#xD;
and his face was very sober; then he said, "You&#xD;
may be in the right, Farnbarn; you are an older&#xD;
man than I, and have seen more of the world; 1&#xD;
suppose I ought to yield to you with a better&#xD;
grace, but it is very hard for me to believe one&#xD;
who has ever seemed so nearly perfect, so very&#xD;
false; and just at this time, too-I could have a&#xD;
little more courage if the boy had no trouble&#xD;
upon his mind; but it is not a light matter to&#xD;
bring up an affair of this kind when his heart is&#xD;
well nigh crushed, for, let you say or think what&#xD;
you may, I know he was most devoted to his&#xD;
mother, and there is a chance of its not being&#xD;
true; don't you think it cruel to accuse at such a&#xD;
time on uncertainties?"&#xD;
There was something like a smile upon the face&#xD;
of Mr. Farnham, as he answered, "The boy&#xD;
must be a very good actor; I don't doubt but that&#xD;
he is; to some it is more natural and much easier&#xD;
to seem than to be ! One who could act the&#xD;
honest so as to so thoroughly deceive a man of&#xD;

usiness, all the time practising the accomplished&#xD;
ogue, could, I presume, make himself appear a&#xD;
most devoted son. I trust no one, sir, no one,&#xD;
until I have tried them in every way. Let us be-&#xD;
ieve every man, woman and child evil until we&#xD;
have proved them good!"&#xD;
There was much of bitterness in the words and&#xD;
one of the speaker.&#xD;
" I don't like that doctrine, Farnham ; I would&#xD;
udge mankind more by myself. No, no, let us-&#xD;
udge the hearts of our fellows by the hearts we&#xD;
carry within our own bosoms-oven that may be&#xD;
evere enough."&#xD;
" May be you think I do, Phelps; may be you&#xD;
think I judge in this way, that I am so severe."&#xD;
and the speaker gave a bitter laugh.&#xD;
Before his companion had time to answer, a&#xD;
slight confusion outside the counting room made&#xD;
them both look through the widow, and the&#xD;
hind-hearted Mr. Phelps saw with regret the ob-&#xD;
ject of their slight disagreement receiving the&#xD;
greetings of the other clerks in the store ; but&#xD;
without lingering among them for a moment he&#xD;
was making his way towards the counting room,&#xD;
where for the last few months he had been nearly&#xD;
the whole time occupied in a way which told he&#xD;
possessed the entire confidence of Mr. Phelps at&#xD;
least. His manner was anything but expressive&#xD;
of .  consciousness of having betrayed a trust con-&#xD;
fided in him, as he entered the little room where&#xD;
the two gentlemen were sitting.&#xD;
Mr. Phelps arose to receive him, and in spite&#xD;
of all that had passed he felt his heart yearn-&#xD;
ing towards the youth, who now. stood accused&#xD;
of robbing him,-and what seemed so very&#xD;
strange, it had not been to benefit himself, but&#xD;
to satisfy the extravagance and dissipation of his&#xD;
employer's son, one, who by his disobedience and&#xD;
waywardness had forfeited the affection of even&#xD;
his parents. As to Wilson, he saw nothing pe-&#xD;
c liar in Mr. Phelps' manner, and when he had&#xD;
for a moment hesitated to enter, on discovering&#xD;
the room occupied by more than one, the voice&#xD;
was only a little subdued in which he had been&#xD;
bidden to "comein."&#xD;
" I have staid longer than was right, perhaps,&#xD;
Mr. Phelps," he said ; "but I felt you would over-&#xD;
look it at this time.".&#xD;
The answer was to the effect that even now&#xD;
he did not expect him back-he might have ad-&#xD;
ded he could wish he had not come-and as he&#xD;
spoke in a half hesitating way, he stole a glance&#xD;
at Mr. Farnham, who was still seated by the ta-.&#xD;
ble. Wilson naturally followed the direction of&#xD;
the glance, and he started very perceptibly ; at&#xD;
first the face had been turned away from him&#xD;

speaker designed it should be-cold and stern.&#xD;
"What-can I say, Mr. Phelps? you know my&#xD;

see how nearly that resembles it ; had I not readI&#xD;
what is written, I could have taken my oath that&#xD;
I wrote it-though God is my witness, my eyes&#xD;
never before rested upon one word traced there."&#xD;
The tone in which this was spoken was clear,&#xD;
and to Mr. Phelps' heart his words seemed con-&#xD;
vincing, yet, as Wilson had said himself, he would&#xD;
take his oath the writing was no other than his,&#xD;
and so he told the poor boy. This was more than&#xD;
Wilson had looked for-it had seemed to him as&#xD;
impossible that his employer could believe him&#xD;
guilty of this, as that he should believe it himself.&#xD;
For a few moments he struggled with his shame&#xD;
'r,d anguish, and then bowing his face in his&#xD;
hands he wept silently over this wrong, and in his&#xD;
heart he prayed for death, that this sorrow and&#xD;
disgrace might be lost in forgetfulness.&#xD;
CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
"To fly from, need not be to hate mankind."-tBYRoN.&#xD;
"'Labor is worsip!' The robin is singing;&#xD;
'Labor is worship ! The wild bee is ringing;&#xD;
Listen! That eliegnent whisper npspriogiog,&#xD;
Speaks to thy soui from out nature's great heart"&#xD;
[OGonoD.&#xD;
On one of those vast fields of the West which&#xD;
nature has so kindly prepared for the industrious&#xD;
husbandman, embowered within a clump of smell&#xD;
trees and shrubbery, nestled a small hut which&#xD;
bore evident marks of being not only a human&#xD;
habitation, but of its occupant or occupants, who-&#xD;
ever he or they might be, having a thorough ac-&#xD;
quaintance with refined as well as civilized life.&#xD;
Not but that it was rough enough, being built&#xD;
p irtly of stone, partly ofclay, while here and there&#xD;
wais to be seen an unhewn beama of wood, serv-&#xD;
ing apparently as a sort of frame work, yet to one&#xD;
acquainted with Western life, as well asWestern&#xD;
architecture, this structure declared the hands&#xD;
which had fashioned it possessed of no small&#xD;
share of industry and cleverness, for save three&#xD;
or four windows, composed of a single pane of&#xD;
glass each, in the external of the little dwelling&#xD;
there were no evidences of foreign manufacture.&#xD;
The planks from which the doors had been man-&#xD;
ufactured had never known the benefit of plane or&#xD;
even saw; although done with extreme nicety, it&#xD;
wis clear that the degree of smoothness which&#xD;
they possessed had been procured by the use of&#xD;
no other utensil than the common axe, while the&#xD;
enineys, three in number, which were built two&#xD;
feet, at least, abteve the roof, were fashioned of&#xD;
rieugh fragments of stone and clay.&#xD;
&#xD;
For all this primitiveness, there was something&#xD;
in the form and the very air of the dwelling and&#xD;
its surroundings, which declared that no common&#xD;
mind or taste had been occupied in planning and&#xD;
arranging every thing. Even in the choice of the&#xD;
spot, there was expressed.a love of the beautiful,&#xD;
which would have made one wish to see the pro-&#xD;
prietor of the little domicile, as well as the hun-&#xD;
dreds, one- might almost say thousands of acres&#xD;
of magnificent land which surrounded it. With&#xD;
the refinement manifest in all which had been&#xD;
done here, what could have driven'the possessor&#xD;
of all this to seek such hermitage, scores of miles&#xD;
away from any human habitation, and hundreds&#xD;
of miles distant front civilization? Near enough&#xD;
to the cottage, that the murmuring of its clear&#xD;
waters sounded as a soothing music, flowed a&#xD;
beautiful river, bordered by the graceful willow,&#xD;
interwoven with here and there a flowering&#xD;
shrub which had floated down upon the stream,&#xD;
and, lodging among the overhanging willows, had&#xD;
taken root, and in their new hom flourished as&#xD;
if they had known no other.&#xD;
But these were not the only flowers which bar-&#xD;
thened tie air with their rich perfume. Trailing&#xD;
rose bushes clambered up the rough walls of the&#xD;
cottage until they crept along the very eaves;&#xD;
the.wild jassamine, too, was there, mingling its&#xD;
sweet breath with its floral compare ion, and doing&#xD;
more than could any art to beautify the rough&#xD;
dwelling, while all was inclosed by a hedge form-&#xD;
ed of the wild gooseberry and raspberry bushes.&#xD;
which in their season furnished an abundance of&#xD;
delicious fruit as a reward to whoever kept and&#xD;
triramed them with such care. A larger bed of&#xD;
wild strawberries, greatly improved, as must be&#xD;
nearly everything by contact with civilization and-&#xD;
cultivation, were even now ripening in the warm&#xD;
June sun, telling of princely feasts to be enjoyed&#xD;
there. But a few rods distant the young corn was&#xD;
waving to the soft warm breeze, while peas,&#xD;
beans, potatoes, and many other kinds of vegeta-&#xD;
bles were thriving in that manner which told of&#xD;
no common care. Small patches of grain, too,&#xD;
testified of the richness of the soil, but in their&#xD;
laying out they seemed more the work of a&#xD;
gardener than of afarmer, firtheir size was so di-&#xD;
minutive they seemed to promise very little to-&#xD;
wards the support of whoever had thus nicely&#xD;
cared for them.&#xD;
In an opposite direction from  the little em-&#xD;
bowery were the only animate objects to be seen&#xD;
around the dwelling-a half dozen sleek, happy,&#xD;
looking goats were feeding, quite content appa-&#xD;
rently with the fresh, tender grass which was&#xD;
growing in such abundance around them, ad,&#xD;

To take in at a hasty glance all these objects&#xD;
something in the same order they have bee-i des-&#xD;

dwelling. The ma was young and well clad,.&#xD;

there was about him an air of weariness which&#xD;
spoke of a long journey, and his person as'well&#xD;
as his clothing told of some days' absence freun&#xD;
the civilized world, and in t he expression of his&#xD;
sunburnt face there was a half mournful  eager-&#xD;
ness not usually seen in an aimless wanderer-a&#xD;
desire to go a little further-to take another step,&#xD;
even a frantic longing for it, but with that long-&#xD;
ing a fear to move lest some hope, too long cher-&#xD;

still remained bowed, but the voice expressed a Wilson Harley,as entirely innocent of the crime&#xD;
vehemence almost wild,                      of which he had been accused and proved guilty,&#xD;

The young man drew from his pocket a well- to rejoice over the clearing away of this sad mys-&#xD;
worn paper, and unfolding it in a hurried manner, tery-to return to his home where he has never&#xD;

designating with his finger the paragraph in well to believe aught evil of him-to the world&#xD;

quired, and commenced reading. At first he but noble and upright, that in the face of all proof to&#xD;
spoke the words, without comprehending the the contrary, those the best acquainted, refused&#xD;
idea they would express, but as he proceeded a to believe guilty of the smallest deviation from&#xD;

"And so the woild sees," this was the read- according to the work which may lay before&#xD;
ing of the paragraph, " how Wilson Harley, the them, for the accomplishmentof which they must&#xD;

the innocent victim of two evil-minded men-.&#xD;
one the confidential clerk in the establishment&#xD;
where .he, and the youth he so villanously&#xD;
wronged, were serving-the other, the son of one&#xD;
of the principal partners in the establishment.&#xD;
It is by the prompt acting of this last gentleman&#xD;
that all this has been brought to light. - Forget-&#xD;

be prepared ; let us hope and pray that the future&#xD;
of this young man may be such as to atone for&#xD;
what has passed, by making him forget all that&#xD;
there has been of sorrow mingled with the joy.'&#xD;
Wilson Harley, the subject of these explana-&#xD;
tions and good wishes, read this to the close.&#xD;
Every word was spoken with the distinctness of&#xD;
one who did not quite catch the idea, or imagined&#xD;
there might be somewhere a hidden meaning&#xD;
which might escape him. When he reached the&#xD;
end he paused a moment, then began again read-&#xD;

&#xD;
and when her husband insisted upon his having&#xD;
been a most reliable man, accusing her of a lack&#xD;
of womanly feeling, in thus suspecting him of&#xD;
anything wrong, now that be was beyond defend-&#xD;
ing himself, she told him she had never shared&#xD;
with him the confidence he had felt in his part-&#xD;
ner; she made no pretensions of believing their&#xD;
son less guilty than his father was inclined to&#xD;
thiak him, but, until they had made an examina-&#xD;
tion of Carson's papers, she would not be con-&#xD;
vinced the boy was alone in guilt. Her woman's&#xD;
perception, served her better in this case than&#xD;
did her husband's sounder judgment, as he was&#xD;
himself compelled to acknowledge when the cor-&#xD;
respondence between the two villains--the whole,&#xD;
for three years, was brought to light.&#xD;
"Then it was that we learned all about the&#xD;
part that these two had acted towards you, Wil-&#xD;
lie! Carson, in his caution, had requested the re-&#xD;
turn of his letters, and all, save two or three,&#xD;
were found in his possession; these two or three&#xD;
Phelps had kept to witness against the fellow, in&#xD;
case he proved unmanageable. But they were&#xD;
scarcely needed, for the contents of threatening&#xD;
letters, afterwards written, gave us a pretty good&#xD;
idea of all they contained. Their whole plan for&#xD;
la3 ing you under suspicion was divulged, and&#xD;
their rejoicing over the success of their scheme&#xD;
was such as you might expect.&#xD;
" Mr. Phelps did not wait an unnecessary hour'&#xD;
after this discovery was made before he put a&#xD;
clear statement of the whole affair into the hands&#xD;
of the editor of that paper, and he made no ef-&#xD;
fort to spare his son, or conceal his part in the&#xD;
criminal matter. Neither did he spare his money,&#xD;
Willie, but sent notices and advertisements to&#xD;
papers in all parts of our country, paying liber-&#xD;
ally, and offering extravagant reward for the&#xD;
smallest information of you ; but a year passed,&#xD;
and no tidings cane. Then all were agreed that&#xD;
our only hope of finding you was for me to start&#xD;
out, and never give up the search until I had dis-&#xD;
covered your whereabouts. It has been a long&#xD;
journey, Willie, a very long journey. I have&#xD;
traveled over thousands of miles, North and&#xD;
South, East and West; many a time, as in this&#xD;
ease, hearing of some strange man dwelling in&#xD;
solitude, I have turned in my course and gone&#xD;
hundreds of miles, but to meet with disappoint-&#xD;
ment. This has happened again and again, until&#xD;
I had grown to expect it-or if not to expect it-&#xD;
for my hope of finding you was strong as ever-&#xD;
I was prepared to find at the end of my jaunt a&#xD;
surly, perhaps a grizzly bearded, half civilized&#xD;
being, instead of such an one as had been do-&#xD;
&#xD;
scribed to me, and given us small grounds for hop-&#xD;
ing to find you.&#xD;
"It was with this feeling I followed the path&#xD;
indicated by a rough hunter, more than five hun-&#xD;
dred miles away from here, Wilson. It has been&#xD;
a great tramp, and at last I have my reward-at&#xD;
last my brother is found, and I can rest."&#xD;
Desponding as had been Wilson Harley when&#xD;
his companion commenced    speaking -wholly&#xD;
bereft of hope as he had seemed, he very soon be-&#xD;
came a most attentive listener, and through the&#xD;
whole narration, he made no attempt at an in-&#xD;
terruption, by question or exclamation. But&#xD;
the change which gradually came over his face&#xD;
showed that however hapless he might have been&#xD;
the account was too clear and convincing for&#xD;
even his despair to withstand, and when David&#xD;
crame to the closing up of the story, illustrating&#xD;
the last exclamation by seating himself in the cu-&#xD;
riously constructed, but very comfortable arm&#xD;
chair which his companion had abandoned on his&#xD;
approach to the door, Wilson himself arose,&#xD;
walked hastily across the room two or three&#xD;
times, then stepped out into the freshening air,&#xD;
brushing the heavy hair from his forehead to al-&#xD;
low the breeze to fan his fevered brow! David&#xD;
would rot interrupt him, for, judging from his&#xD;
movements he believed the poor fellow was try-&#xD;
ing to decide whether he slept, or was really&#xD;
awake--whether those tidings were indeed a&#xD;
glad truth, or but a dream to be in one little mo-&#xD;
ment dispelled,.and his solitude be rendered more&#xD;
unbearable that it had been believed, at an end.&#xD;
At last coming back into the house, he grasped&#xD;
the hands of his brother and said in a very trem-&#xD;
bling voice:&#xD;
"David, I have not deserved all this devotion-&#xD;
you have acted more than a brotherly part, but&#xD;
now I cannot speak of it: I believe-no, it can-&#xD;
not be a dream, no dream could seem soreal-&#xD;
my heart begins to open to receive the great joy,&#xD;
but my banishment from real gladness has been&#xD;
so long an one, we must wait a little--wait a&#xD;
little till I become accustomed to this wonderful&#xD;
change."&#xD;
"Amid until you put it in my power to break my&#xD;
fast, which has lasted since a very early hour&#xD;
this morning, and from which I begin to feel&#xD;
symptoms'not in the least enviable," exclaimed&#xD;
David in a gay -tone.&#xD;
The little speech had the desired effect upon&#xD;
Wilson. His thoughts so suddenly turned from&#xD;
himself to the necessities of one who had done&#xD;
for him more than a brother's duty, in a mao-&#xD;
ment he seemed inspired with all the life and ef-&#xD;
ficiency of a real host.&#xD;

"Ah! yes David-yes, yes,, how thoughtless Il&#xD;
have been-you look faint and exhausted. Be-c&#xD;
fore I can go about your dinner to prepare it, I1&#xD;
must get you something to refresh yourself with&#xD;
ntil it is ready."&#xD;
Quickly he disappeared through a side opening&#xD;
in the room, and after a few moments' absence&#xD;
returning, said : "Come Davie, a wash after your&#xD;
long walk will do much towards resting you, and&#xD;
time will pass more quickly too if you are doing&#xD;
something, for, although I have all that one can&#xD;
wish in the way of provision, it requires cook-&#xD;
i'ng, which you have not forgotten must take a&#xD;
ittle time!"&#xD;
As he spoke, he led the way into an inner room&#xD;
from which was a door opening out upon the&#xD;
river. David looked around him with perfect&#xD;
astonishment. Here was a bed having a most in-&#xD;
viting and comfortable look to a weary man.&#xD;
Two or threo'chairs, quaint enough in their fash-&#xD;
ioning, and upholstered with, deer-skin, were&#xD;
sitting around the room. A large wooden bowl,&#xD;
evidently of home manufacture, stood upon a&#xD;
washstand. This last article of furniture was of&#xD;
the necessary height, and consisted of a trans-&#xD;
verse portion of avery large tree, nicely sawn out,&#xD;
and serving'the purpose for which it was made&#xD;
remarkably well. Upon a rock hung towels,&#xD;
which for their niceness might have shamed many&#xD;
a landlady, and just at hand were an abundance&#xD;
of water and soap, h most convincing proof that&#xD;
all these comforts were for use as well as show.&#xD;
A dressing table, of the same style as the wash-&#xD;
stand, supported a small looking-glass, with other&#xD;
articles for the toilet, besides a vase of fragrant&#xD;
flowers, which filled the room with their perfume,&#xD;
and, to complete all, the floor was covered with&#xD;
bark matting, which gave to everything a look of&#xD;
elegance and comfort that would have astonished&#xD;
many another one as it did David McDonald-&#xD;
meeting it here, hundreds of miles away from&#xD;
civilized life. After looking around him for a&#xD;
few moments, his face expressing something of&#xD;
the surprise and admiration he felt, the young&#xD;
farmer exclaimed:&#xD;
"Upon my word, Willie, you are a real prince&#xD;
here ! So far as you are concerned, I don't think&#xD;
I've done anything worthy of thanks ; to be lugged&#xD;
away from so nice a place as you have made of&#xD;
your little home, don't seem to me a particularly&#xD;
desirable thing. At first one is inclined to think&#xD;
it all the work of magic, but a second glance&#xD;
gives all a most tangible position and character,"'&#xD;
" Well, I must leave you to test the material-&#xD;
ity of all by yourself. If-y ou flnd yourself in need&#xD;
of anything not at hand, ring the chambermaid's&#xD;

your wash yiu had better throw yourself upon&#xD;
the bed for a little time, for a thorough stret e--&#xD;
ing of one's limbs after so much fatigue is a nost&#xD;
refreshing thing ; and after it, dinner will do 3 t&#xD;
all the more good. Now let questions wait on&#xD;
appetite for an hour or so," and before livid&#xD;
could reply he found himself alone.&#xD;
After his not unwearisome journey of nore&#xD;
than a thousand miles, and the last half of it&#xD;
performed on foot, in a canoe, or upon the Nwk&#xD;
of a borrowed mule, each in its turn, as be couhtl&#xD;
catch it, the thought of rest was really gr-t&#xD;
ful to our traveler. Not i three long weeks had&#xD;
he seen its much of real comfort as lnow surround-&#xD;
ed him in this little home, so remote front ani1&#xD;
other human habitation; and all was the tt If&#xD;
this one lone man. But it was not natural ihat&#xD;
too long a time should be spent in sentiment al&#xD;
soliloquising, when he had not for long da1 s t  -&#xD;
joyed the luxury of such a with as wet now&#xD;
waiting for him, and very soon idding hitnst If of&#xD;
unnecessary clothing, he fell at it with the iphi it&#xD;
of one who fully appreciates the virtue to be ftuint&#xD;
in a free use of soap a-d water, and when hh l&#xD;
toilet was completed, in spite of excitenient, lhe&#xD;
felt himself constrained to act upon the sugg-&#xD;

&#xD;
a wooden basin, and soon he might have been&#xD;
seen gathering from the well-tended vines the rich&#xD;
strawberries, which could not have failed to&#xD;
tempt one's appetite at any time, in any land.&#xD;
But a short time was required to fill the ves-&#xD;
sel from the abundance, and good care was taken&#xD;
that not one of a mean appearance for size or&#xD;
ripeness should find its way in - among those so&#xD;
large and juicy. The most fastidious housewife&#xD;
would have been satisfied with the niceness dis-&#xD;
played in this part of the, preparation. During&#xD;
the time consumed in plucking and preparing the&#xD;
fruit for the table, and in crushing cotfee which&#xD;
he had himself roasted, the fire had got so well&#xD;
under way as to be nearly ready for use, and now&#xD;
from a subterranean apartment, reached by rais-&#xD;
ing one of the heavy planks which went to make&#xD;
'up the floor, a hole scarcely deep enough to be&#xD;
dignified with the appellation of cellar, Wilson&#xD;
produced a pair of prairie chickens ready dress-&#xD;
ed for cooking. These split in half and laid up-&#xD;
on the bright wood coals, soon sent through the&#xD;
little cabin a most inviting and hunger exciting&#xD;
odor, and that mingled with the perfur e of the&#xD;
coffee which was soon smoking near it, foretold a&#xD;
feast in which many an epicure might have wish-&#xD;
ed to share.&#xD;
It was with an emotion very nearly akin to&#xD;
pride that the young man viewed all his arrange-&#xD;
ments, when everything was ready for his.visiter;&#xD;
very often had he entertained guests here in his&#xD;
hermitage, and taken great pleasure in feeding&#xD;
with luxuries, not often enjoyed upon these prai-&#xD;
ries, poor, worn, and half starved hunters, but&#xD;
never before had he prepared a dinner with so&#xD;
much thought to its appearance.&#xD;
David was fast asleep when Wilson entered&#xD;
his bed room to call him, but he knew too-well&#xD;
the sensations and dreams arising from sleeping&#xD;
upon a half famished stomach, to feel any hesi-&#xD;
tation with regard to arousing him.&#xD;
" Come, Davie," he said, laying his hand upon&#xD;
the sleeper's shoulder--" dinner is waiting for&#xD;
such an appetite as you must have !"&#xD;
The young man still half dreaming sprang to&#xD;
the floor and for a moment he was wholly be-&#xD;
wildered, every thing around him seemed so&#xD;
strange. A word from Willie helped him to re-&#xD;
call every thing that had occurred before he&#xD;
slept.&#xD;
"After all, I have not seemed to you such a&#xD;
very slow cook, have I, David ?"&#xD;
"No, Willie, nor is your bed such an one as one&#xD;
would look to find in such an out of the way place&#xD;
as this. It must possess some very peculiar prop-&#xD;
erties, for when I threw myself upon it I had not&#xD;
&#xD;
the most distant thought of sleep, but after my&#xD;
head touched the pillow I had but one idea-that&#xD;
was not such a very definite one either-some-&#xD;
thing like what a Turk might indulge in, when&#xD;
resting in his luxurious cushions."&#xD;
"And I hope my dinner may be as agreeable to&#xD;
your empty stomach, as was my bed to your worn&#xD;
out limbs."&#xD;
Saying this, William led the way to the adjoin-&#xD;
ing apartment, and pointed his guest to one of the&#xD;
two seats at the well-spread table. David sat&#xD;
down, and for a little time looked upon all with&#xD;
an astonishment too great for words. At last he&#xD;
broke out--&#xD;
"Willie, do you remember the first time Delia&#xD;
Phelps visited our home?  I have thought of&#xD;
what she said of our home a thousand times-&#xD;
she was not certain as to its reality-thought it&#xD;
fairy-like, you remember !' Now, I understand&#xD;
precisely how she felt; I am in the same fix with&#xD;
regard to everything here !"&#xD;
"And your best way of becoming convinced of&#xD;
the tangibility of my surroundings, is to attack&#xD;
them, my boy," said Wilson playfully, and then&#xD;
be went on in the same spirit-"and, to begin, I&#xD;
will give you this half of a prairie chicken, and&#xD;
a cup of coffee, which I flatter myself can't be&#xD;
surpassed in the old McDonald home."&#xD;
Following the suggestion of his host, David&#xD;
soon found himself too much absorbed in the&#xD;
work before him for any thing like conversation,&#xD;
and Wilson watched with real satisfaction the&#xD;
eager enjoyment of his brother. At length when&#xD;
he had demolished a second half of a prairie-&#xD;
chicken, and emptied his cup the second time of&#xD;
the refreshing coffee, and passed it to be again&#xD;
filled, he said,&#xD;
"Now do, Willie, tell me how on earth you&#xD;
have managed to possess yourself of all that I&#xD;
see in your house ? your table compares well&#xD;
with our very best, and yet I'm sure I've traveled&#xD;
nearly a hundred miles without coming across a&#xD;
trading post, or even a hut where lived any liu-&#xD;
man being-and yet I find you here in the enjoy-&#xD;
ment of real luxuries-prairie chickens swim-&#xD;
ming in butter, coffee rejoicing in the richest of&#xD;
cream, and delicious civilized bread, and as to&#xD;
the strawberries, I'll ask no questions of them&#xD;
till I have become satisfied on those other points "&#xD;
"I can very easily satisfy you, David," an-&#xD;
swered Wilson, at the same tiume,helping him to&#xD;
a generous dish of strawberries, dressing them&#xD;
well with cream and sugar. "I have very little&#xD;
here, that this magnificent land does not produce&#xD;
for me. The chickens live in tens of thousands&#xD;
upon these plains. As to wheat and corn, I grow&#xD;

that you had overslept yourself! Since that&#xD;
have you had no recollection of the time which&#xD;
intervened between your coming here and the&#xD;
time of that awaking 1"&#xD;
" No, I only felt that I had dreamed a great&#xD;
deal," was the answer"-though when I wished&#xD;
to get up, you told meI had been sick, which I&#xD;
should very soon have discovered from my weak-&#xD;
ness ; yet I had no idea, Willie, that I was 'so&#xD;
long sick-it must have been nearly three&#xD;
weeks!"&#xD;
" You were insensible to all that passed around&#xD;
you, three weeks'to the very day, David !"&#xD;
"And all that time you were here alone, Wil-&#xD;
son-no one to assist you in the care of me !"&#xD;
exclaimed the invalid in a commiserating way.&#xD;
" Did you have any fears that I would not re-&#xD;
cover, at any time I" he asked in a low voice.&#xD;
"You had better have asked-had I at any&#xD;
time a hope that you would recover, and I should&#xD;
have answered you, it was impossible to give up&#xD;
all hope while there was life! Your disease was&#xD;
such as very few in this part of the world re-&#xD;
cover from; yet you had a very severe attack,&#xD;
and without a grain of medicine lived through it,&#xD;
though it run the very extreme limit of its course&#xD;
upon you, which is twenty-one days."&#xD;
"And all this time I knew nothing of your&#xD;
anxiety and suffering, my poor Willie. How&#xD;
dreadfully desolate you must have been !"&#xD;
" Your unconsciousness was the greatest bless-&#xD;
ing to both of us, David-let us feel thankful 'for&#xD;
it-for had you realised but a fourth part of your&#xD;
suffering, you could not have lived. A look at&#xD;
&#xD;
11&#xD;
&#xD;
these thin hands will tell you something of what&#xD;
it must have been !"&#xD;
The invalid regarded for a moment his emaci-&#xD;
ated hands, with a sad, thoughtful expression;&#xD;
then seeming to recollect himself, he exclaimed :&#xD;
"What must they think at home? IIt is now&#xD;
a full six weeks since they have received a word&#xD;
from me, and Heaven only knows how much&#xD;
longer it must bel rve no patience with my-&#xD;
self, Willie, thatI should have got sick at such a&#xD;
time! Strong as I was, there was no possible&#xD;
use in it! How we might have been at home&#xD;
long before this had I but shown myself half a&#xD;
man! I tell you there was no sense in my giving&#xD;
out at such a time!" The young man spoke in&#xD;
an excited, impatient way. His companion took&#xD;
one of his thin hands within his own.&#xD;
"David! David! let us not dare to murmur,&#xD;
but rather lift our hearts to Heaven with thanks-&#xD;
giving! You have stood upon the very brink of&#xD;
the grave, and yet your feet were staid there!&#xD;
Let us thank God with our inmost souls, that&#xD;
this stroke did not fall when it seemed almost&#xD;
upon us! It is not ours to yield, or not, to dis-&#xD;
ease, as we may choose. Man, with all his&#xD;
boasted strength, must yield, even as an infant,&#xD;
when sickness comes-and in this, as in every&#xD;
thing else, we have the one comfort,-no trial-&#xD;
not even the very smallest one, is without a pur-&#xD;
pose !"&#xD;
"Yet will you not acknowledge, Wilson, this&#xD;
was quite unnecessary?" asked David, in a voice&#xD;
which showed him somewhat humbled-"I may&#xD;
require a little chastising, I do not doubt but that&#xD;
I do-but I have not been the sufferer-to me it&#xD;
has been no more than a dream! All the trial&#xD;
has fallen upon you, and Heaven knows you had&#xD;
suffered enough before!"&#xD;
"We must endeavor to believe, David, that&#xD;
Heaven knows much better than we can what&#xD;
we need-if we are never able to see why this&#xD;
should have been, it is such a blessing that we&#xD;
know there is an eye unlimited in vision, which&#xD;
understands wherein all this was required!-Lie&#xD;
quiet, David; I can't allow you to talk any miore&#xD;
-but you.may just listen calmly to what I have&#xD;
to say, for I have thought of all this a great&#xD;
deal.&#xD;
"When you were first taken sick I knew well&#xD;
the nature of your disease, and, fully realizing&#xD;
your danger, I was almost wild with anxiety.&#xD;
Having no kind of medicine-not even the most&#xD;
simple-I knew not what to do! I have never&#xD;
kept any medicine for my own use, having no one&#xD;
to administer it in case I was ill; and hAving seen&#xD;
too much of the bad results of a sick man, un-&#xD;

THE MITHERLESS BAIRN.&#xD;
&#xD;
educated in the science, taking medicine with-7&#xD;
out even sober reason to guide as to quality or i&#xD;
kind, I had thought it better, if disease shouldN&#xD;
come, to allow it to take its course! But when&#xD;
you were taken so violently ill, how sorely I re-&#xD;
gretted my extreme prudence r but there was no&#xD;
help for it. Could I have left you, fifty miles at&#xD;
least must have been passed over to have procur-&#xD;
ed what I required; but to leave your side was&#xD;
out of the question, so all that was left to me wasf&#xD;
to do the very best I could, and hope and pray&#xD;
that some straggling hunter might happen along,1&#xD;
to provide me with a part, if not all, that your&#xD;
case required.&#xD;
"Sometimes I grew almost frantic with wait-&#xD;
ing and watching, but none came, and now I con-&#xD;
fidently believe it is to the absence of all these&#xD;
remedies we owe your recovery. Circumstances&#xD;
compelled me to make the most of what I pos-&#xD;
sessed, and you not only passed the fearful crisis&#xD;
in safety, but since that you have gone on mend-&#xD;
ing with astonishing rapidity. Providence knew&#xD;
better than I did what you required, and in spite&#xD;
of my importunings, acted for your good. I be-&#xD;
lieve, David, it is always so, though it may be very&#xD;
hard for us to reconcile it with our human wisdom,&#xD;
Sometimes, to make us more trusting, perhaps,&#xD;
circumstances are so arranged that, blind as&#xD;
we are, we can't help seeing that what we had&#xD;
thought a bitter affliction, proved a very great&#xD;
ble ssing. Is it not possible, we may sometime&#xD;
learn wherein this very serious illness of yours&#xD;
was necessary to our actual good ?"&#xD;
Wilson's low tone and gentle manner quite,&#xD;
soothed his patient's excited irritability, and&#xD;
when the speaker paused with this question,&#xD;
David said with a smile;&#xD;
" Your life has made you very different from&#xD;
what you used to be, Willie, and we were never&#xD;
much alike ; you know very well I am no philos-&#xD;
opher!" This was said with a smile.&#xD;
"But you are a Christian, David, which is much&#xD;
better !" was the quick, earnest answer.&#xD;
"I don't know--I'm  not so pure I am that&#xD;
either. I don't think I have been subjected to&#xD;
the-test which decides real practical christianity!&#xD;
When all goes fair and prosperous, it is very&#xD;
easy to trust all to God,-to say we believe He&#xD;
does every thing for the best and acts with a&#xD;
wisdom which man should not dare to question ;&#xD;
but trial and sorrows and disappointments make&#xD;
a very different case, and the christianity that&#xD;
won't stand these-that won't enable one to look&#xD;
to God still with confidence, and say with sincer-&#xD;
ity, ' though Thou slay me, yet will I trust in&#xD;
&#xD;
Thee,' isn't the kind one wants, and I am afraid&#xD;
s the kind I possess."  The invalid spoke in a&#xD;
way that told his companion how much he felt&#xD;
what he was saying.&#xD;
"There may be much truth in all you say,&#xD;
David, but when every other prop is removed&#xD;
beyond our reach, to me it would seem an un-&#xD;
natural thing to refuse that one that can never,&#xD;
fail. In prosperity, one might easily forget God,&#xD;
for surrounded by thousands of worldly blessings,&#xD;
he don't realize their need of those divine-&#xD;
but when desolate, almost hopeless, how unnatu-&#xD;
ral to cast aside the only glimmer of hope and&#xD;
comfort."&#xD;
"Ah! yes, you understand ; but remember,&#xD;
every one don't understand !" was the reply-&#xD;
'but, to seem the Christian so completely as to&#xD;
deceive the world and even one's self, is very&#xD;
easy, when all-goes fair; but seeming won't an-&#xD;
swer in adversity-that shows you to yourself&#xD;
and the world as you really are-and I had almost&#xD;
said, that only can !"&#xD;
Just at this moment,. a shadow falling across&#xD;
the door, made Wilson start up, and an instant&#xD;
after, a stranger stepped upon the threshold.&#xD;
There was no need that he should ask for rest&#xD;
and food ; his haggard face told how much both&#xD;
these were required ! Wilson pas no new hand&#xD;
at acting the hospitable host, and very soon in&#xD;
the adjoining room the traveler was partaking of&#xD;
a comfortable dinner, and scarcely was he&#xD;
through with satisfying the cravings of hunger,&#xD;
when his head began to droop, and stretching&#xD;
himself upon the floor, he soon slept as a man&#xD;
who had known no rest for days !&#xD;
For two or three hours Wilson allowed the&#xD;
poor worn-out fellow to lay as he had thrown&#xD;
himself down, for he seemed so unconscious of&#xD;
the hardness cfhis couch, a sleep seemed so much&#xD;
of a luxury to him, the young man thought it a&#xD;
pity to break his slumbers ; but after all the&#xD;
household duties had been completed, and David&#xD;
comfortably settled for the night, the apartment&#xD;
which had long ago been christened "the guest&#xD;
chamber," was prepared by Wilson to receive&#xD;
the worn-out stranger. It was with great diffi-&#xD;
culty he was aroused sufficiently to change the&#xD;
floor for a comfortable bed, and before his head&#xD;
scarcely touched the pillow he was in a sound&#xD;
sleep again--having hardly spoken a word of&#xD;
thanks for all the kindness he was receiving.&#xD;

As he said this, there was in his eye a fiery  "Ha ! ha ! you need not recoil-I only wished&#xD;
glow which made his companion shrink away ;- to convince you," he said in a half indifferent way,&#xD;
&#xD;
11&#xD;
&#xD;
4I&#xD;
&#xD;
"You are not going, air-the sun is overpower-&#xD;
ing in its heat, and feeble as you seem you would&#xD;
faint before anhour !"&#xD;
For an instant the eyes of the traveler were&#xD;
turned upon the speaker; it was the first time&#xD;
Wilson had been able to catch his gaze, and the&#xD;
demoniac expression which seemed a part of&#xD;
those light blue eyes, was a strong enough plea&#xD;
to let the fellow go without another remon-&#xD;
strance. But then he was a man-or at least&#xD;
bore the form of one-and the past had taught&#xD;
Wilson the injustice of judging too hastily-at&#xD;
least let the past have been whatever it might,&#xD;
now he- was a fellow-wanderer, and sympathy&#xD;
seemed most natural.&#xD;
After the first moment the young man's remon-&#xD;
strance seemed quite unheeded-even forgotten&#xD;
by the grizzly bearded stranger. The only ac-&#xD;
companiment he had-a small greasy knapsack-&#xD;
he had carefully adjusted over his shoulder, and&#xD;
confined it there by a strap passing across his&#xD;
breast and under one arm. The fastening of this&#xD;
was looked to with as much care as had it been&#xD;
a safeguard to a miser's treasure, and the host&#xD;
saw that his kind words had scarcely been ob-&#xD;
served by the old man.&#xD;
" You have nearly fifty miles to pass over be-&#xD;
fore you find another white man, sir; do you&#xD;
think you have the strength to endure the&#xD;
fatigue ?"&#xD;
Wilson asked this in a way which could not&#xD;
fail to elicit a reply-his manner was respectful,&#xD;
and his voice and words were expressive of sin-&#xD;
cerity.&#xD;
"Fifty miles, you say !" was the answer, in a&#xD;
half dubious tone.&#xD;
"Fifty miles ! well it can't be got over by lying&#xD;
still, young man."&#xD;
"No, certainly not," said Wilson, now more&#xD;
than half attracted towards the stranger, for his&#xD;
voice possessed a peculiar charm in its musical&#xD;
tones, which had not been before perceptible, as&#xD;
this was the first time he had spoken, save in&#xD;
monosyllables, and his pronounciation was not&#xD;
that of a wild hunter, as one would have expect&#xD;
ed from his appearance. "But, is it so imperative&#xD;
that you should be in haste? a few days' rest&#xD;
might prepare you for your journey, and possible&#xD;
secure to you company, for hunters frequently&#xD;
pass over this route."&#xD;
" I wish no company, young man, and I've n&#xD;
few days to lose. My life has been long, but&#xD;
shall count it all lost-all lost- should I fail i&#xD;
doing the one thing that remains to me!"&#xD;

it told that this somethiny was no work of love-&#xD;
that it was the closing up of a life dark and fear-&#xD;
ful-but his contact with desperate characters&#xD;
had not been of rare occurrence since his banish-&#xD;
ment from the world, and he had long since learn-&#xD;
ed that to influence them at all, it was necessary&#xD;
to treat them with a frank confidence.&#xD;
" Your business is your own, sir, but as a fellow-&#xD;
man I would do my best to persuade you to take&#xD;
a day at least to recruit, if that business is of the&#xD;
least importance to you or any one else. For in&#xD;
your present state you can't endure the hardship&#xD;
you will be compelled to meet, before coming to&#xD;
the next stopping place; and if you perish alone&#xD;
upon the prairie, your work must perish with&#xD;
you-besides you have no means of procuring&#xD;
food."&#xD;
" No, my old rifle had served me well, but I&#xD;
lost it three days ago. Worn out with walking,&#xD;
I thought to try an old raft, but it was too much&#xD;
racked, and I came near going over-as it was,&#xD;
my rifle, which I had used for more years than I&#xD;
can tell, went to the bottom of the river. But I&#xD;
can't stop, young man-I may need rest, and by&#xD;
and bye I shall have a long one, but not yet. I&#xD;
should sleep illy if this last act of my life was not&#xD;
done-even were the grave my bed, I should not&#xD;
rest !"&#xD;
The voice of the old man seemed much&#xD;
changed as he said this. It was no longer clear,&#xD;
but hollow and mysterious in its sound.&#xD;
Wilson saw it was useless to attempt to dis-&#xD;
suade him, and now all that was left, was to fit&#xD;
him out as well as it lay in his power for the con-&#xD;
tinuance of this journey,&#xD;
"Are you acquainted with the trail before&#xD;
you?" was the young man's inquiry-and when&#xD;
his companion answered that he was not, having&#xD;
passed much lower when on his way to the&#xD;
mountains. Wilson went on,&#xD;
" You mentioned having tried an old raft-if&#xD;
you have strength to manage it, I can let you&#xD;
have a small skiff, which would give you a little&#xD;
t better chance of getting through, as you could&#xD;

&#xD;
THE MITHERLE,&#xD;
sought for one to whom he could trust his two&#xD;
treasures, but thus far his search had been vain.&#xD;
Old enough that naturally the end of his race&#xD;
should have seemed to him near, this man shrank&#xD;
from the thought of death, as if he had been the&#xD;
only one upon whom the sentence had been pro-&#xD;
nounced. Without a heart-throb of love for any&#xD;
being on earth save his child, without confidence&#xD;
in even her, he clung to the world with! more&#xD;
than mortal strength, refusing to listen if one&#xD;
spoke of another life, for which it seemed neces-&#xD;
sary that he should be making himself ready.&#xD;
"This life," he would say with cold bitterness,&#xD;
"has been quite enough. When it is done I would&#xD;
be dead-senseless as the earth which shall cover&#xD;
me; I have no hope, no desire beyond-no! nor&#xD;
fear-I have lived and shall be dead ! If there&#xD;
is a Creator, to him be all the glory or shame&#xD;
connected with my life, whieh has contained very&#xD;
little of good to me."&#xD;
Such, and even more sceptical and chilling re-&#xD;
plies, were received by all who could gain his ear,&#xD;
and ventured to remonstrate with him on his un-&#xD;
natural way of looking to the end, which to all&#xD;
others than himself was seen rapidly approach-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
To all who had access to his secluded home,&#xD;
it was evident the man of the world was passing&#xD;
from his possessions; but these all were very&#xD;
few. The physician of the neighboring village;&#xD;
a lawyer whom-he had called upon to act as his&#xD;
man of business when he had found it necessary&#xD;
to have as much as a letter written, and two or&#xD;
three of the wealthier, more worldly old men,&#xD;
were all. His constant, ever-faithful companion&#xD;
and nurse, was his young and beautiful daughter,&#xD;
and she was all he wished for; and cold he now&#xD;
have been assured that a century of ears was&#xD;
before him, to be spent as had been the last few&#xD;
weeks, he would have declared himself content.&#xD;
Not that he seemed happy, or that his child could&#xD;
be to him a gay, even a cheerful companion; but&#xD;
it was as near to happiness as anything he had&#xD;
known in Iong years, and better than anything he&#xD;
could look for in the future; and as to his child,&#xD;
Henrietta, she was almost content that she was&#xD;
allowed to rest quietly'in a little home-like nook.&#xD;
Since her early childhood she had scarcely&#xD;
known what it was to rest. Her .father would)&#xD;
place her in a school, to which he had been re-&#xD;
commended by a most reliable friend, but scarcely&#xD;
would he have left her,-when distrust would creep,&#xD;
into his heart ; he would fancy he saw covert do-&#xD;
signs in either the friend or those having charge&#xD;
of his daughter, upon her or him, or his wealth ;&#xD;
so with some pretence, it scarcely mattered what&#xD;
&#xD;
SS BAIRN.                                87&#xD;
-for he permitted no one to question him-he&#xD;
would remove her, just as she had become suffi-&#xD;
ciently attached to feel a sense of home-sickness&#xD;
stealing over her at the severing of newly-formed&#xD;
ties. So nearly her whole life of twenty-one&#xD;
years had passed-she, the envied of many an&#xD;
one, yet herself feeling that the daughter of the&#xD;
simple cottager, with her home love and home&#xD;
duties, was an object which she might well envy.&#xD;
And other cares and sorrows, too, she had than&#xD;
this. Her father she loved-not blindly-but de-&#xD;
votedly-unselfishly. She knew well he was not&#xD;
what he once had been, though his face with the&#xD;
dark cloud was the only father's-the only pa-&#xD;
rent's face she had everknown ; but her heart told&#xD;
her there had been a time when it had not rested&#xD;
there-that a crushing sorrow, as her fears some-&#xD;
times whispered, a crushing shame hadstamped it&#xD;
upon hin ; and, loving him as she did, it was not&#xD;
possible for this young girl to escape the effects&#xD;
of this shadow.&#xD;
When, in early spring, Mr. Farnham had de-&#xD;
clared to his daughter his determination to seek&#xD;
a home within a little cottage, in a most seclu-&#xD;
ded part of the country, where they should see&#xD;
no one only such as they might choose, and have&#xD;
the benefit of fresh air and exercise, which his&#xD;
gradually failing health admouished him were&#xD;
most essential, she received the ipteligence with&#xD;
delight. It mattered very little to her where she&#xD;
went, so it was home-though, had it been her's to&#xD;
choose, she would have said the country in pre-&#xD;
ference to the city, and a cottage hoo1 rather&#xD;
than one of splendor.&#xD;
Her father was no niggard in his providing, nor&#xD;
did she lack taste in the expenditure of his&#xD;
wealth, and she found her little home a very at-&#xD;
tractive place; so munch so, that she felt she&#xD;
could be very happy here with no other society&#xD;
than her father, her books and her music-act-&#xD;
ing the housewife when necessary, and attending&#xD;
her garden for amusement.&#xD;
Nor did Henrietta find, on trial, that she hail&#xD;
overrated her domestic qualities. Her home&#xD;
seemed to her a delightful place, and narrowly&#xD;
she watched herself that, by no look or wish ex-&#xD;
pressed, should her father be led to seek change&#xD;
on her account, and now surely she felt they were&#xD;
safe from his apprehending anything serious fromI&#xD;
any acquaintance or intercourse with society-&#xD;
for they had none that could afford any one the&#xD;
least pleasure.&#xD;
Early in May they had left thme city, and then&#xD;
Mr. Farnham had not allowed his feebleness to&#xD;
be but slightly visible to any one-even to Ilhenri-&#xD;
etta-though she knew he was very far from well,&#xD;

&#xD;
THE MITHIERLESS BAIRN.&#xD;
&#xD;
for too often she heard his uneasy turning upon his&#xD;
bed, and sometimes, during the still hours of the&#xD;
night, she heard his troubled step up and dewn&#xD;
his room, which told that rest was a stranger to&#xD;
his pillow.;. but to her anxious inguiries,his re-&#xD;
ply was always that he was well, and her know-&#xD;
ledge of his.nature forbade her pressingthe mat,&#xD;
ter. Bat as spring lost itself in summer,. he&#xD;
yielded more and rpore to the enervating influ-&#xD;
ences around him,.and often times stern and silent&#xD;
he sat from morning till night unoccupied, save&#xD;
with his thoughts.&#xD;
Before coming into this secluded home, Mr.&#xD;
Farnham had confided to his partner, Mr. Phelps,&#xD;
his plan for the summer, to remain perfectly&#xD;
quiet and separate from business for the year,&#xD;
that, as he expressed it, he might become famish-&#xD;
ed for the turmoil connected with it, of which he&#xD;
was now heartily sick. Although these two men&#xD;
often disagreed, yet no person had for long years&#xD;
the -decided confidence of this cold unloving&#xD;
man of the world that Mr. Phelps had. How he had&#xD;
won it he could not 'himself well have told, for&#xD;
well he remembered the many sharp controversies&#xD;
they had held, not alone upon business, but often&#xD;
upon important moral questions, which not un-&#xD;
frequently leave bitterness behind. '&#xD;
"I think he will withdraw from the house-&#xD;
he is immensely rich, and with this one child only&#xD;
to provide for, I can see no good reason for his&#xD;
remaining where he is sure to be crossed, for I&#xD;
can't hold my peace when I hear such ideas ad-&#xD;
vanced; and to tell you the truth, I shan't be sorry&#xD;
when the day of our dissolution comes, for he is&#xD;
not a pleasant partner."&#xD;
This, or something very like it, had been Mr.&#xD;
Phelps' remark to his wife nearly a score of times,&#xD;
yet the firm remained the same ; and when Mr.&#xD;
Farnham told of his plans for the year, he gave&#xD;
up all care and management to his partner more&#xD;
entirely than he had ever done before, confiding&#xD;
to him his retreat, at the same time requesting&#xD;
him not to annoy him in matters of business, or&#xD;
reveal to any one his secluded quarters.&#xD;
And three months gave themisanthrope no cause&#xD;
to regret his confidence, for never in all that time'&#xD;
had he been been vexed with unnecessary letters,&#xD;
or a visitor that could have been attributed to any&#xD;
information given by his partner. Yet instead&#xD;
of becoming famished for the world, by being&#xD;
out of it, he every day grew more entirely to dis-&#xD;
like it, to wish never more to return to it. But&#xD;
his child soon begun to understand that his&#xD;
thoughts, let them be what they might, were not&#xD;
health-producing, and day after day, she increas-&#xD;
ed her efforts to win him from his moodiness, to&#xD;
&#xD;
converse with her, to listen to her music or&#xD;
reading, or to give her his assistance in, caring&#xD;
for her flowers. But her efforts proved futile or&#xD;
nearly so, for in spite of everything he kept his&#xD;
place in his large chair, every day growing thin-&#xD;
ner, and, had it been possible, more dejected, his&#xD;
face wearing the expression of one inwardly&#xD;
struggling against fate, yet compelled gradually&#xD;
to yield.&#xD;
But for her father's apparent unhappiness,&#xD;
Henrietta would have been very happy in her&#xD;
cottage home, for, with all her capabilities for&#xD;
deriving enjoyment from the outer world, she was&#xD;
very far from dependent upon it, having within&#xD;
herself resources sufficient to atone. for the loss&#xD;
of society; but when she saw the only object&#xD;
the earth contained for her to love,. without hope&#xD;
or joy, she, could not fail to feel her heart at&#xD;
times weighed down by gloom.&#xD;
The silence which Henrietta's father had ever&#xD;
manifested towards her upon nearly all.subjects,&#xD;
but particularly upon his cause for shunning and&#xD;
hating the world., had made her fear ever to ap-&#xD;
proach him upon that matter, or even ask a ques-&#xD;
tion which might give him an, idea it was called&#xD;
up by his peculiarities. Yet this would not have&#xD;
been so much a source of sadness to her, had it&#xD;
not been so connected with another thought-her&#xD;
mother. Once-it had been very many years&#xD;
since-she had asked her father to tell her of her&#xD;
mother, who hed died long before she could re-&#xD;
member ! How this 'request had been received&#xD;
she was not likely to forget-the perfect storm&#xD;
of rage which had been expressed in her parent's&#xD;
face, and the terror which his voice had sent&#xD;
through her,as he bade her never question him&#xD;
again of one who had turned him from a man to&#xD;
a fiend, who had well nigh made him hate his&#xD;
own child, that she had been its mother.&#xD;
She had not a coward's heart, yet the thought&#xD;
of her father's words sent a chill to her very soul,&#xD;
even after years had passed away, and, whatever&#xD;
might be her desires, this remembrance proved&#xD;
sufficient to keep her from asking further ques-&#xD;
tions. But often enough she longed and prayed&#xD;
that her parent's reserve might be cast aside, that&#xD;
she might give him all the comfort to be derived&#xD;
from sympathy; for, whatever might be the sor-&#xD;
row-aye-shame. was it' not her own as well&#xD;
as his? And that he should carry it to the grave&#xD;
shut close within his heart, drawing his very life&#xD;
blood, she felt was doing not only himself but her&#xD;
a cruel wrong&#xD;
However, time had gone on so long without&#xD;
bringing any change, she had almost ceased to&#xD;
hope for any, and, woman-like, made the most of&#xD;
&#xD;
THE EITHER]&#xD;
the little she could do for her father, coaxing him&#xD;
out into her little garden sometimes-exercising&#xD;
her ingenuity in getting up tempting dishes for&#xD;
his delicate appetite, and, while he sat at table,&#xD;
chatting away, encouraged by scarcely an an-&#xD;
swer, thus hoping to win him to forget himself&#xD;
and take more than his scanty morsel of food ;&#xD;
but, had not her perseverance been inexhaustible,&#xD;
she would have very soon been discouraged by&#xD;
her poor success, and, as it was, her heart often&#xD;
enough sank within her ; but she felt there was&#xD;
no good in despair, and possibly her unhappy&#xD;
parent was a little less wretched when he saw&#xD;
her cheerful--so day after day she tried her little&#xD;
wits and bore her failures as best she could.&#xD;
The first of August came without bringing&#xD;
with it any marked change, and one, at least, of&#xD;
the dwellers in the little cottage began to feel in&#xD;
connection with all around her, a most agreeable&#xD;
home sensation.' Every day the man of all work&#xD;
was sent to the village, to bring home whatever&#xD;
the post office might contain for them ; but Hen-&#xD;
rietta waited his return with no anxiety, for none&#xD;
of her many friends knew where to direct their&#xD;
epistles had they been disposed to write-but&#xD;
with her father it was very different-from the&#xD;
moment the man set out upon his errand, 'till he&#xD;
returned with the welcome intelligence-"no&#xD;
letters"-he was a stranger to rest; yet,;tq a&#xD;
casual observer, this would not have been so ev-&#xD;
ident as was it to his child, who watched every&#xD;
movement of his dark, overshadowed eyes, in a&#xD;
way which told her how dear was his happiness&#xD;
to her. One day when she was engaged upon a&#xD;
piece of sewing, sitting near her father, she ven-&#xD;
tured to say, as she saw his eyes turn quickly at&#xD;
some slight noise,&#xD;
"What makes you start so, father ? it .was but&#xD;
this rose bush sweeping against the window !"&#xD;
"I start!" he exclaimed in a tone too expres-&#xD;
sive of offense to be misunderstood--"I did not&#xD;
start, Hettie, and I don't wish to be told that I&#xD;
did by my child."&#xD;
Seeing her mistake in speaking of it, or show-&#xD;
ing that she observed his discomfort, the daugh-&#xD;
ter hastened to make amends, by saying in a very&#xD;
quiet tone :&#xD;
"I might have been mistaken, father, but I&#xD;
was unusually anxious about you to-day, for you&#xD;
were not looking as well as usual, and I may be&#xD;
nervous myself; but don't be angry with me, dear&#xD;
father."&#xD;
As she said this, she put aside her work, and&#xD;
leaving her chair, took her place upon a stool at&#xD;
her parent's feet, laying her cheek down upon his&#xD;
knee, in a pleading way.&#xD;
&#xD;
"!                                                                                                                                                      --&#xD;

"No, no, Hettie, child, I am not angry ; what&#xD;
should I be angry at ? Why will you fret your-&#xD;
self in this way ? I've no cause to be angry, and&#xD;
I'm no criminal, that I should start at every&#xD;
sound-am I, daughter ? I say I'm no criminal,&#xD;
Hettie, that I should be afraid of the wind; tell&#xD;
me if you have ever thought, me criminal, or&#xD;
ever dreamed ill of me ?"&#xD;
He spoke in a hurried, half gasping tone, which&#xD;
quite alarmed his child; and his eyes were&#xD;
strange in their expression, as they might, have&#xD;
been, had he been gazing upon some heart chill-&#xD;
ing sight, which as yet no other eye had seen, but&#xD;
which he was in momentary expectation of being&#xD;
discovered by one who of all others he would&#xD;
have never behold it. Henrietta was now truly&#xD;
alarmed.&#xD;
" Why do you speak like this, father?" she&#xD;
said, pleadingly; "how could I dream ill of you?&#xD;
how could I think you criminal? I know you&#xD;
have suffered ; that you always suffer; but I don't&#xD;
think it your fault ; if I ever did, father, I don't&#xD;
think so now!"&#xD;
" There, that is enough, Hettie-if you ever&#xD;
did, you don't now-that is enough!"&#xD;
He said this in a cold, severe tone, and his child&#xD;
understood that his more gentle mood was gone;&#xD;
but, if she had possessed the courage to reply,&#xD;
the arrival of the servant would have prevented&#xD;
her.&#xD;
As was her wont, she hastened out to receive&#xD;
whatever he might have brought for her father.&#xD;
" There's one letter, ma'am-and not sich a&#xD;
very great load to carry, either, ma'am, though&#xD;
they seem in a might hurry about its gittin here,&#xD;
for they were just startin a man to bring it over&#xD;
when I got there."&#xD;
Henrietta took the letter eagerly, for her fath-&#xD;
er's peculiar manner towards her, joined to what&#xD;
the man had said of the letter, had awakened a&#xD;
strange terror in her breast-a fear of something&#xD;
dreadful coming-what, she could not have told.&#xD;
A glance at the superscription told her it was&#xD;
from her parent's partner, and in one corner the&#xD;
"please deliver with haste," explained what&#xD;
the servant had told her of a messenger about be-&#xD;
ing despatched with the letter when he arrived.&#xD;
A moment she was hesitating whether she should&#xD;
deliver the missive to her father in his present&#xD;
mood, when his hand was laid upon her arm.&#xD;
"What are you looking at, child-why are you&#xD;
standing here ? is the letter for you or me ? "&#xD;
"For you, father ; it is for you, but don't look&#xD;
in that way at me !"&#xD;
" Give the letter here, and be quiet, girl; what&#xD;

of forgiveness, and it was my hand which wiped&#xD;
the death-damp from her brow, and at last closed&#xD;
her sweet eyes ; and when I saw her stretched&#xD;
to her rest, with the head of her dead infant pil-&#xD;
lowed upon her bosom, I murmured as I pressed&#xD;
one last kiss upon her pale cold lips, 'thank Godc&#xD;
she is at peace!'"&#xD;
. . j&#xD;
Henrietta had sat with lips parted, and as her I&#xD;
head was bent forward her young face bore theP&#xD;
very impress of agony-but as these last few&#xD;
words were spoken every feature relaxed, and&#xD;
giving a heavy sob she murmured involuntarily as&#xD;
it seemed, "thank God !" and her face was bu-&#xD;
ried in her hands.&#xD;
Her companion started at the sound of her!&#xD;
voice, and quickly he caught the meaning of her&#xD;
emotion.&#xD;
"Hah poor child! your heart shrunk from&#xD;
the thought, that she was your mother ! I did&#xD;
not think of that, poor little trembler ! No, she&#xD;
and all that belonged to her was laid in the grave,&#xD;
and I lived to avenge their wrongs ! The wretch&#xD;
who had done all this evil moved proudly among&#xD;
his fellow-men and all smiled upon him. He had&#xD;
wealth, talent and education-these won him the&#xD;
place which should only be given to one possess-&#xD;
ing a heart of virtue. But I held my peace. I&#xD;
resolved to bide my time, for I knew it would&#xD;
come. He was courted by the world and ere&#xD;
long, I said to myself, would come the time when&#xD;
he would choose for himself one dearer than all&#xD;
others. I was right, and not very long had I to&#xD;
wait.&#xD;
"But Heaven is my witness, that, wholly lost&#xD;
as my heart was, I felt something like regret when&#xD;
I saw what a fair and noble being must be crush-&#xD;
ed to accomplish my end ; but the remembrance&#xD;
of my ruined hopes so overcame everything in&#xD;
my soul but a desire for revenge, and from that&#xD;
moment I never wavered. But I would not ap-&#xD;
proach one so high-souled and noble,to leave her a&#xD;
crushed and ruined thing. Could I have done it, I&#xD;
would not! Besides, I knew the man with whom&#xD;
I had to deal too well to take a mis-step in the&#xD;
doing of my work. Self was his idol; had I left&#xD;
that untouched, I felt he would but laugh at&#xD;
me.&#xD;
"I had forced him to consider me a friend, and&#xD;
he dreamed not that I knew him as the -lighter&#xD;
of my joy, and at his bridal none smiled more&#xD;
brightly than did I, or spoke their congratula-&#xD;
tions in tones more expressive of friendship; and&#xD;
well might any man be proudly happy-as he&#xD;
was--with such a noble woman loving and trust-&#xD;
ing him so entirely as did his bride.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I did not feel in haste about my work, but day&#xD;
after day I was a welcome guest in their house,&#xD;
and fairly glutted over the destruction I would,&#xD;
work them. With not only the husband, but with&#xD;
his bride too, I learned to feel myself a favorite,&#xD;
visitor, and, had he not been so confident of his&#xD;
own power, I think he might sometime have been&#xD;
ealous of the attention given me by his wife, for&#xD;
his love was not so perfect as to preclude the pos-&#xD;
sibility of such athing, granting, as I must, there&#xD;
was no cause.&#xD;
"A year of their wedded life passed without&#xD;
any jars that the world knew of-though some-&#xD;
times I saw a cloud upon the fine brow of my&#xD;
friend's wife, that I was sure he had had some&#xD;
hand in placing there; but it appeared to me al-&#xD;
ways more a cloud of proud sorrow than of an-&#xD;
ger, and that promised well for me ! Then there&#xD;
came a new joy into the house, in the shape of&#xD;
an infant son-and the father was as proud in&#xD;
his happiness as I could wish to see him-for the&#xD;
prouder he was, the more perfect would be his&#xD;
wretchedness I know !&#xD;
" Their boy they named for me, and I gave it&#xD;
many a caress and tender word-after sporting&#xD;
with the fine little fellow to the delight of both&#xD;
the parents-then I went away from there ; I&#xD;
had an indefinite idea why, yet I would not now&#xD;
explain it, for another who did not know both&#xD;
the characters with which I had to deal, could&#xD;
not understand it. More than a year I traveled,&#xD;
and in all that time I was in constant correspond-&#xD;
ence with both my friend and his wife, and then&#xD;
there came a letter which told me of another lit-&#xD;
tle link added to the household chain-a lovely&#xD;
daughter-and the father's heart rejoiced as so&#xD;
did the mother's, that this little stranger was&#xD;
like its father, much more than was the son.&#xD;
The same dark eyes, the mother wrote me, that&#xD;
we must both of us understand--and the hair&#xD;
was mote like his than like hers. Poor confiding&#xD;
noble heart, she little knew what a villain I was,&#xD;
nor how poorly I was about to repay her confi-&#xD;
dence! ,But now I felt was my time and I im-&#xD;
proved it, as the desolation which followed was&#xD;
quite sufficient to prove.&#xD;
" By anonymous letters I warned the man in a&#xD;
mysterious way of somedanger which was threat-&#xD;
ening his home; I spoke of his best friend, or he&#xD;
who appeared to be so, being his bitterest enemy:&#xD;
I spoke of his first born, his idolized son: asked&#xD;
him whose name he bore-whose likeness was&#xD;
stamped upon his baby features? for, before I&#xD;
left my friend's house, the child's resemblance to&#xD;
me had often been spoken of. All this could&#xD;
not fail to have some influence upon the man, as&#xD;

&#xD;
er, my darling brother, his right ; bring him home,&#xD;
and hear him speak with his own lips his forgive-&#xD;
ness for the wrongs of the past, that your last days&#xD;
may be your best days; and then, any own father,&#xD;
you shall have no chance to complain, that your&#xD;
child-your Hettie, has lost aught of her affec-&#xD;
tion for you'"&#xD;
She spake tenderly, but with a woman's firm-&#xD;
ness-one who has an object to accomplish, for&#xD;
which her life would not be too great a sacri-&#xD;
fice, could it not be gained without. Her poor&#xD;
old father sat meekly bowed down, listening as&#xD;
one he felt deserved no mercy; but he made no&#xD;
answer to what his child had said.&#xD;
"Father," she went on, "may he come in-&#xD;
may this strange man come in, and show to you&#xD;
that which shall prove beyond a doubt, the truth&#xD;
of what he has said ; may he come now, father-&#xD;
without a moment's delay? for you know it must&#xD;
be done, and the sooner it is passed the better it&#xD;
will be for you !"&#xD;
The cowering form shrunk down lower at&#xD;
this appeal, but there was no escape ; and in a&#xD;
&#xD;
95&#xD;
&#xD;
You have had a strong hand in our sorrow.&#xD;
I claim it as a right-as one of the sufferers-as&#xD;
a child of her you so deeply wronged-that you&#xD;
take not away the little power my father has left,&#xD;
for repairing this great wrong of restoring my&#xD;
brother to his right!" Henrietta spoke with the&#xD;
spirit of a high-souled woman.&#xD;
"You are a brave girl!'" the old man said, ris-&#xD;
ing from his chair; "you shall control me in this,&#xD;
thohgh I would not have believed the earth con-&#xD;
tained the being who could influence me as you&#xD;
have. I will be gentle with an mortal en(Wy 1(f-&#xD;
your sake, and you shall promise me that you will&#xD;
sometimes think of me with kindness, when I&#xD;
have gone to my rest!"&#xD;
The old man spoke with feeling, and the grate-&#xD;
ful look which his companion gave him, would&#xD;
have been a sufficient answer, but she had a&#xD;
better.&#xD;
"I thank you for this, and if my brother ever&#xD;
returns to us, I promise you, our thoughts--not&#xD;
only mine but his-when they turn to you, shall&#xD;
not be such as can take from the peacefulness of&#xD;
&#xD;
prison; and who do you think was his chief ac-&#xD;
cuser ? I tell you, child, it was his own father'1&#xD;
And he knew he was raising his voice against the&#xD;
child of her he had promised to love, cherish andk&#xD;
protect! Do you remember this case, young&#xD;
lady, the case of Wilson Harley? in which your&#xD;
father and ims stood up against him for whom&#xD;
strangers' hearts were melted with pity ?"&#xD;
Henrietta's attention had been chained through&#xD;
this whole relation, and she looked as one pre-&#xD;
pared for a startling announcement ; but, what-&#xD;
ever she had expected, this inquiry of the strange&#xD;
narrator brought her suddenly to her feet.&#xD;
" His father and mine !  Wilson Harley's&#xD;
father and mine ! Are you mad, sir, or do you&#xD;
know what you are saying ?" She asked this in&#xD;
a scarcely audible voice, and her hand which had&#xD;
been laid upon the old man's shoulder, held him&#xD;
in a vice-like grasp. He took hold of her hand in&#xD;
a tender, pitying way. ,&#xD;
" Be calm, child-I have not spoken as one&#xD;
mad , I have not told this story as though it had&#xD;
been originated in my brain; I wonder that I&#xD;
could speak as calmly as I have, for I came here&#xD;
with but one desire-to complete my revenge !&#xD;
I knew my days were numbered, and night and&#xD;
day I have traveled, that I should not be too late;&#xD;
but a sight of your face softened my heart; I re-&#xD;
membered your mother and the wrong I had done&#xD;
her, and the longings which I had felt to see your&#xD;
father writhe with his agony of sdul, when he&#xD;
should hear that his wife was as innocent of that&#xD;
of which he accused her, as were you, then his&#xD;
infant daughter, gave way before other thoughts&#xD;
and emotions. Iam a different man from what I&#xD;
have been since this shadow fell upon me-since&#xD;
that dreadful blighting of my hopes. I could al-&#xD;
most give up this interview with your father, but&#xD;
now I am influenced by a higher motive than re-&#xD;
venge ! Justice now compels me to see him, to&#xD;
tell him all that I have told you, to deliver the&#xD;
proofs into his hands, that he may know that I,&#xD;
and I only wrote those letters which first led him&#xD;
to doubt-and then to cast off his wife forever !&#xD;
"This more than revenge now actuates me-&#xD;
and when I have done this, I shall feel that my&#xD;
work upon this earth is completed ! Now, do&#xD;
you doubt my speaking in my sober senses 7"&#xD;
This he asked of his companion in a quiet tone&#xD;
which he knew so well how to command-and it&#xD;
had a soothing influence over her. She was still&#xD;
&#xD;
"My mother ! my poor darling mother !-so no-&#xD;
ble, yet so deeply wronged," burst from her lips.&#xD;
"Yes, deeply wronged-and so was another who&#xD;
still lives to forgive the sins which have been&#xD;
committed against him. When I started upon&#xD;
this mission, which was not one of love, I thought&#xD;
this other-this brother youi have never known--&#xD;
guilty of a crime which must ever render him&#xD;
an outcast from society; but before .1 came here&#xD;
I learned this was but another cruel wrong he&#xD;
had suffered by the injustice of his fellow-men.&#xD;
Now take me to your father, child, that I may&#xD;
put it in his power to retrieve the past, to a very&#xD;
small extent.'&#xD;
Thus called upon, the girl arose to comply, but&#xD;
in spite of herself she shrunk from the task be-&#xD;
fore her. 'Tis true she had sometimes felt there&#xD;
must have been a dark page in the life of her&#xD;
father, but never had it influenced her in her be-&#xD;
havior towards him, or slackened her in the most&#xD;
implicit obedience; and now she inwardly shrunk&#xD;
from seeing him humbled, though, as this strange&#xD;
being who had been her companion for the last&#xD;
hour had said, she knew and felt it was justice-&#xD;
a debt her father owed to his child, his first-born,&#xD;
who had suffered too deeply for his sins.&#xD;
With her mind full of these thoughts, she turn-&#xD;
ed into the house, and the first sight which met&#xD;
her eyes brought from her an exclamation of&#xD;
alarm. There sat her poor old father, leaning&#xD;
helplessly against the window seat, concealed&#xD;
from view from the porch by the wavy muslin&#xD;
drapery. His eyes were not closed, yet he&#xD;
seemed unconscious of the entrance of his daugh-&#xD;
ter, for there was no movement of limb or muscle.&#xD;
But when she went to his side and took his cold&#xD;
hand, calling upon him-&#xD;
"Father, dear father ! "&#xD;
He raised his eyes to her face with such an ap-&#xD;
pealing expression, and his voice might have&#xD;
awakened sympathy in a less pitying heart as he&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"After that, Hettie, after hearing all that you&#xD;
have justlistened to, can you call me dearfather ?"&#xD;
She laid her arms about the trembling form,&#xD;
much as she might have laid them around a very&#xD;
sinful, but penitent child.&#xD;
" You are my father, and what there has been&#xD;
in the past to grieve over, a child should not al-&#xD;
low to come between her parent and herself, Only&#xD;
do what remains to be done; restore to my broth-&#xD;
&#xD;
broken voice ne answered,                    your rest."&#xD;
" Do as you think right, child-I might as&#xD;
well be crushed at once! I deserve nothing&#xD;
better! I deserve no mercy."                             CHAPTER        XV.&#xD;
"Hush! father, you should not speak in this&#xD;
way! think what he has borne, and yet, father, he&#xD;
has been innocent! Should you murmur at this   "What is the hour, IHettie, my child-is if nt&#xD;

child, my Hettie, would not forget her tender- "No, father, we c'uld not expect him yet; we&#xD;

The daughter felt two strong loves drawing before to-morrow at this tinie ?"&#xD;
upon her heart and in opposite directions, but  "Another day's waiting ! I shall go mad, child.&#xD;
justice whispered that for this once the daugh- If I was to die without seeing-without ev en&#xD;

her.                                           This, Mr. Farnham asked of his child, in a&#xD;

equal had been her father's share in this evil do- s&#xD;
ing, but she answered tenderly,          .&#xD;
" He is very feeble, dear father, and I can't in-&#xD;
duce him to try the smallest thing as a restora-d&#xD;
tive ! He says his work is done, and the sooner&#xD;
he is done with life the better for him and for the&#xD;
world-yet he is very gentle-like child almost,&#xD;
in his way of receiving any little attention !"&#xD;
The last part of the girl's remark was un-&#xD;
heeded by the father, and his answer showed how&#xD;
cold and hard was his spirit even in this hour of&#xD;
his humility.&#xD;
"He is right ; he has done a demon's work ;&#xD;
he has rooted the last vestige of good from my&#xD;
heart-he has robbed- me of the noblest woman&#xD;
that ever breathed, made my son fatherless, my&#xD;
daughter motherless, my life that of a cold-heart-&#xD;
ed wanderer. Let him die uncared for, neglect-&#xD;
ed ; let him die the death of a dog, as he should !&#xD;
My child, let him perish, soul and body, unpitied,&#xD;
uncared for !"&#xD;
"Father, father, how can you speak so-don't&#xD;
you remember ? Is it not true that he, too, has&#xD;
suffered wrong-and, oh ! forgive me for saying&#xD;
it, but I must; I feel it is right-at your hands,&#xD;
too 7"&#xD;
"Child, how dare you, how dare you speak to&#xD;
me in this way '"   was the sick man's fierce&#xD;
answer, half raising himself in the bed, and fix-&#xD;
ing so firm a grasp upon his child's arm as made&#xD;
her shrink, in spite of herself, with the pain&#xD;
which he gave her. For an instant his eyes&#xD;
gleamed upon her, then seeming to recollect him-&#xD;
self, he sank back cowering upon the pillow.&#xD;
"Ah yes," he said helplessly, "I must bear it,-&#xD;
must take insult from my child! I have not&#xD;
thought it could ever be. I must submit to be-&#xD;
ing neglected as she may choose for this villain-&#xD;
my worst enemy ! I might have known it would&#xD;
be no better! -What right had I to expect aught&#xD;
else of human love ?"&#xD;

the great sin which had borne it along, until it&#xD;
seemed beyond the reach of a noble, manly peni-&#xD;
tence, it would have echoed in condemning tones,&#xD;
"what right?" but his was the humility of a cow-&#xD;
ard. He wished to see his son reinstated-see&#xD;
him occupying the position which belonged to&#xD;
him, because he was his son-because now the&#xD;
world woula, in spite of his desire to the contra-&#xD;
ry, hear of all the wrong which the boy had suf-&#xD;
fered at his own father's hands; so he would pa-&#xD;
cify the world by doing what seemed to him amost&#xD;

was no meekness, no remembrance within penitent&#xD;

orrow of the young, fair, but too weak being he&#xD;
had won from an honorable love, to cast her off a&#xD;
a ruined, hopeless heart-to die-but for the en-&#xD;
during fondness of him who had lavished upon her&#xD;
he wealth of his soul-alone and friendless! No&#xD;
thought of her years (f struggling with the hard&#xD;
world; the woman, who had the right to look to&#xD;
him as her friend and protector, when all others&#xD;
should fail; no heart grievings as he remembered&#xD;
his poor boy, a homeless, friendless, wanderer as&#xD;
he had been on the Christmas morning, more&#xD;
than fifteen years agone, When he had thrust him&#xD;
unfeelingly from his door, to wander to the grave&#xD;
where slept his wronged mother, at last safe&#xD;
from all sorrow, where he must have died but&#xD;
for the more faithful affection of the noble dog,&#xD;
who, after more than five years' separation, re-&#xD;
coguized his young.master and refused to be sep-&#xD;
arated from him again! No, although these last&#xD;
were remembered, they were not remembered&#xD;
with self-condemnation, with a sorrow which&#xD;
gives promise of better things, but with a cower-&#xD;
ing humility, with a bitterness of soul towards&#xD;
his less guilty sharer in this life-work of evil-&#xD;
an inward cursing of himself for his stupidity in&#xD;
thus being duped out of all the good life&#xD;
might have contained for him, in coming at last&#xD;
to that miserable state, that he must be an object&#xD;
of compassion to his bitterest foe!&#xD;
Poor Henrietta! this was not the least trying&#xD;
part of her grief, to watch over her own father;&#xD;
to see him still the cold man he had ever been,&#xD;
and yet so weak as he had become mentally and&#xD;
physically! She felt that she could almost have&#xD;
rejoiced in his childish, dependence, had it been&#xD;
accompanied by any thing like childish sorrow&#xD;
or humility; but to see him thus, but for the one&#xD;
thought-he. was her father-she must have&#xD;
shrunk from him with loathing!&#xD;
Then her. poor another! often she had said&#xD;
"willingly would I submit to a life of drudgery-&#xD;
of toil of the meanest kind, but to be certain&#xD;
that no shame attached itself to that name !"&#xD;
Now she'was certain! This wild being's strange&#xD;
story had borne upon its face the very impress of&#xD;
truth, but he did not ask them to trust to that!&#xD;
The greasy discolored knapsack-the only thing&#xD;
he had brought with him upon his long journey,&#xD;
contained proofs which no one could for a mo-&#xD;
ment dispute ! , The original of the letters Mr.&#xD;
Farnham had received, with erasures and altera-&#xD;
tions, proved him  beyond a doubt the writer of&#xD;
those anonymous epistles, which had at first&#xD;
aroused the demon suspicion in the husband's&#xD;
breast ! This must have been enough to satisfy&#xD;
any one that the wife had been wholly innocent&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
of every thing which had been laid to her charge,&#xD;
and for which she and her first born had been&#xD;
cruelly cast off!&#xD;
Then the small package which had been left&#xD;
with the poor woman-the most timely friend the&#xD;
mother had had near her-to be preserved for her&#xD;
poor boy when he should be motherless, contain-&#xD;
ed her marriage certificate; all! aye, her only&#xD;
earthly possession ! That she felt it would be to&#xD;
him a treasure in after years, proving to him who&#xD;
were his parents!&#xD;
A letter accompanied it, addressed to the boy,&#xD;
her darling Willie, telling him of all she had suf-&#xD;
fered, and of her entire innocence and utter ig-&#xD;
norance of all of which she had been accused ;&#xD;
but what was more convincing of her innocence&#xD;
than all the rest, was her firm faith in her boy be-&#xD;
lieving her so ! All had been written in great sor-&#xD;
sow, but there had been mingled with it no doubt&#xD;
as to this one thing ; her boy who knew her so&#xD;
well-knew her better than had ever any other&#xD;
earthly being-his heart would tell him how&#xD;
deeply she had been wronged !&#xD;
Poor thing! when-she was penning that stain-&#xD;
ed and blotted epistle, her nearly powerless&#xD;
hands, scarcely able to make the words legible,&#xD;
she had little thought her daughter, then hardly&#xD;
more than an infant, would weep over it bitter&#xD;
tears of pity, regret and deep affection ! That to&#xD;
her woman's heart it would speak of her mother&#xD;
as noble and worthy of all the fondness her chil-&#xD;
dren could give her; that to one who had never&#xD;
known her, save in her days of unconscious infan-&#xD;
cy, it would carry proof as conclusive of her in-&#xD;
nocence, as would it to her boy who loved her as&#xD;
very few children are capable of .loving, as very&#xD;
few mothers deserve to be loved !&#xD;
The thought of her mother, as she now had a&#xD;
right to think of her was to the daughter a great&#xD;
joy, but it was a joy mingled with deep grief!-&#xD;
With the certainty of her mother's purity-the&#xD;
mother she had never known, there came another&#xD;
certainty-that of her father's cruelty, guilt.&#xD;
The only being she had ever known to love, she&#xD;
now regarded--as how could she help doing-&#xD;
as deserving nothing better than a shunning&#xD;
pity-but, no,she would not unteach her heart its&#xD;
affection-it could do her other parent no good,&#xD;
and she believed, was that other one able to&#xD;
speak, she would bid her be true and faithful in&#xD;
all her duties as daughter.&#xD;
Then there arose in her mind the picture of&#xD;
the motherless one who had sought shelter from&#xD;
the bitter coldness of the winter's night upon&#xD;
the porch of her father's mansion-their father's&#xD;
she could now say--the sweet sad-faced Wilson&#xD;
&#xD;
Harley ! Nor did this picture, with all the re-&#xD;
membrances which must accompany it, do much&#xD;
towards comforting her heart as to the part her&#xD;
father had acted ! He had recognized in this&#xD;
desolate boy, the child of her who-even grant-&#xD;
ing her guilt-he had so wrongfully cast off upon&#xD;
the cold unpitying world, homeless, helpless, and&#xD;
if sinful, with no encouragement to mend her&#xD;
ways ! He had once loved her, and yet he could&#xD;
spurn her poor starving boy from his door with&#xD;
hard unmanly words ! But Providence had not&#xD;
been forgetful of those forgotten by man ! The&#xD;
instinct of the noble dog, who had been the boy's&#xD;
protector and constant companion in his early&#xD;
infancy, had enabled the animal to recognise the&#xD;
poor child, in spite of change; yet Henrietta was&#xD;
ignorant of the noble Neptune's activity and more&#xD;
than animal instinct, in caring for his charge,&#xD;
and saving him from the death which had ap-&#xD;
proached so nearly.&#xD;
In truth she knew very little of what had been&#xD;
her brother's life since, save the fact connected&#xD;
with his disgrace, for much as she had desired to&#xD;
meet some of the McDonald family, or Mrs.&#xD;
Phelps, that she might learn something more of&#xD;
one who had so much interested her when a child,&#xD;
her father had ever prevented her seeing them.-&#xD;
Now she knew it had been by design.&#xD;
These thoughts all had a place in her mind, pro-&#xD;
ducing strangely conflicting emotions, but, fortu-&#xD;
nately perhaps it might be counted, she was not&#xD;
left to indulge them undisturbed. Here were two&#xD;
old men hardened in sin, now, after long lives&#xD;
which had contained very little of good, reduced&#xD;
to childish dependence, and she must act as their&#xD;
sole nurse.&#xD;
Her father required from her the closest atten-&#xD;
tion, as he had ever required and received the&#xD;
most implicit obedience, and with Henrietta there&#xD;
was no thought but to answer his every call as&#xD;
nearly as she could, and in so doing neglect no&#xD;
other duty; the other-that wretched, desolate&#xD;
man, who had traveled over hundreds of miles to&#xD;
remove the stain which had for years rested upon&#xD;
that unknown mother's name--no matter what&#xD;
had been his motive--he had done them a great&#xD;
good; had repaired as nearly as lay in his power&#xD;
the sins of a life-time; now that all his life pow-&#xD;
er seemed exhausted, was he to be left uncared&#xD;
for, unattended? No ! not while such ready&#xD;
hands as Henrietta Farnham was near, and ac-&#xD;
tuated by such a true woman's heart as she pos-&#xD;
sessed!&#xD;
Her father would have had the fainting travel-&#xD;
er thrust from the door, even in the hour of his&#xD;
cowering humiliation, and when towards him had&#xD;

family.&#xD;
Soabetween the two invalids Henrietta found&#xD;
herself so well occupied, there was small time left&#xD;
for idle thought, and the three days which passed&#xD;
between the arrival of Wilson Danforth and the&#xD;
return of the messenger which had been dis-&#xD;
patched to Mr. Phelps, to beg of him to lose no&#xD;
unnecessary time in coming to his partner, Mr.&#xD;
Farnham, who was too feeble to leave his bed-&#xD;
passed much more quickly to her than either of&#xD;
the sick ones. But the sense of relief which she&#xD;
felt when she saw the messenger spring out of the&#xD;
carriage at their cottage gate, followed quickly byI&#xD;
the kind, ever ready Mr. Phelps, was no less than&#xD;
would it have been had she watched the way from&#xD;
which the travelers were expected, and counted&#xD;
the minutes with the greatest impatience.&#xD;
Way down in her heart there was a restless&#xD;
aching to have some one at work to bring about&#xD;
the return of her brother while her father was&#xD;
still living, and if possible, while that other flick-&#xD;
ering life should continue to burn. Had it been&#xD;
possible she felt she should herself have started&#xD;
upon the mission, butthen there would have been&#xD;
none to guard and care for her sick, and she re-&#xD;
solved to perform faithfully the woman's part for&#xD;
which she proved herself eminently fitted, and&#xD;
leave the other to the one Providence should ac-&#xD;
tuate to embark in it; and now when she caught&#xD;
&#xD;
To Henrietta, this was not a small trial, yet&#xD;
she faced it bravely, withholding but one thing-&#xD;
that was the nature of the wrong her father had&#xD;
done Wilson 'Danforth ! She told him it had&#xD;
been grievous-she said that, with such a nature,&#xD;
no one could have expected any less from him in&#xD;
the way of revenge--that his nature was too&#xD;
strong to deal with petty good or petty evil-and&#xD;
she ended by saying:&#xD;
" Father is very bitter towards him, and I don't&#xD;
know as we could expect anything else. You&#xD;
know he has been ill for a long time, but by his&#xD;
strength of will has resisted disease; but this has&#xD;
broken him completely-he has not been able to&#xD;
leave his bed since we heard of it, and some-&#xD;
times I fear his agitation may hasten his end--yet&#xD;
I cannot turn this poor man from our house. Mr.-&#xD;
Phelps I cannot forget, that but for my father he&#xD;
might-I believe he would-have been so differ-&#xD;
ent ! Tell me, am I acting right?"&#xD;
"You are, my child--you are acting with a&#xD;
noble justice; I should be proud to know that my&#xD;
own daughter would under like circumstances&#xD;
prove herself so unselfish-though God forbid&#xD;
she should ever be put to the test !"&#xD;
This last was said with much warmth, and ap-&#xD;
parently as though the speaker was scarcely con-&#xD;
scious of speaking it out-but that it was with&#xD;

die of neglect, want and starvation-but misera- - Henrietta had not dreamed of the possibility of&#xD;
ble, pitiless tyrant that he had become, none Mr. Phelps coming with the messenger-punctu-&#xD;
chose to obey his commands, and he was too al as he ever was in his business transactions-&#xD;
weak to enforce them.                       she had counted upon a delay of a day or two, at&#xD;
Wilson Danforth was placed in Henrietta's least, hoping only that their messenger would&#xD;
own room, and what care he required was given bring them tidings when they might expect him,&#xD;
him by Henrietta herself. But it was very little if he found it possible - to leave home at all; so&#xD;
he wished to have done for him-much less than she was quite undecided how she was to act,&#xD;
he was compelled to submit to and receive of whether it would be better to tell a part of their&#xD;
this girl's attention. However, in one thing he strange story to their visitor, before she took&#xD;
was resolute-not a grain of medicine would he him to her father, and so save the latter the ex-&#xD;

no temptation to yield to her, for he did not wish sense of justice as well as her prudence, inclined&#xD;

should any one else seek to prolong an existence felt to be biased or influenced by petty scruples,&#xD;
which could be of no use to himself or any one and, daughter though she was, she could not be&#xD;

gave him satisfaction very nearly allied to peace ruling principle with her father, and she feared&#xD;

THE MITHERLE&#xD;
him an earnest thought ! Then an instant after&#xD;
he added :&#xD;
"Come, my child, now take we to your father,&#xD;
for there is no time to be lost I would have you&#xD;
remain with us, if he is inclined to cloak himself&#xD;
in the matter, your presence--knowing every&#xD;
thing as you do-will be a check upon him, and&#xD;
he can't so well shrink from performing his part,&#xD;
before you, his child, as could he before all the&#xD;
rest of the world ! I want you should be pre-&#xD;
pared, though, to see him struggle against duty,&#xD;
for he will-but he must be humbled-must be !-&#xD;
there is no help for it ! Humbled to the very&#xD;
dust--I know it will seem to him."&#xD;
Much as Henrietta felt for her father, it was a&#xD;
real comfort to her to    hear Mr. Phelps&#xD;
speak in this earnest, forcible manner---it showed&#xD;
that he appreciated the importance of the case,&#xD;
and that she might look to him for assistance in&#xD;
forcing her father to act with justice---for she&#xD;
saw he must be forced---that he would, if per-&#xD;
mitted, shift the blame, as far as was it possible,&#xD;
to the shoulders of the man whose hopes, whose&#xD;
life, whose very .soul had been blighted by his&#xD;
own evil doings; and this daughter had felt how&#xD;
hard it would be for her, unaided, to prevent this&#xD;
and still have anything like justice meted out&#xD;
to her noble brother and her dead mother! But&#xD;
now, with Mr. Phelps to help her, earnest and&#xD;
strong as he was, and devotedly attached as she&#xD;
knew him to be to her brother, the woman was&#xD;
strong in her heart--'she felt she could stand firm-&#xD;
ly for the right against her father's threats----&#xD;
against even his entreaties.&#xD;
Mr. Phelps could not fail to be startled at what&#xD;
he had heard, although he had cotne prepared for&#xD;
a surprise, and in imagination had conjured up all&#xD;
manner of things, yet the reality was yery differ-&#xD;
ent from any thing he could have fancied. This&#xD;
wild unnatural stranger had come to him for in-&#xD;
formation as to where Mr. Farnham was to be&#xD;
found, but supposing the poor fellow more than&#xD;
half crazed, he did not think it best to enlighten&#xD;
him, yet his manner had been so peculiar he had&#xD;
attached importance enough to the occurrence to&#xD;
give his partner a very minute account of it in a&#xD;
letter, which letter Mr. Farnham had received the&#xD;
very day, and not an hour before the arrival of&#xD;
Wilson Danforth beneath his own roof.&#xD;
When the message to come to Mr. Farnham&#xD;
without an hour's unnecessary delay reached Mr.&#xD;
Phelps, his mind immediately reverted to that wild&#xD;
being, and he thought of some old business mat-&#xD;
ters being called up to trouble and perplex his&#xD;
not over-amiable and forbearing partner. Some-&#xD;
times the idea had crossed his mind that this&#xD;
&#xD;
f'                                                                                                                _%&#xD;

man's dealings might not always have been up-&#xD;
right, he seemed always so suspicious of others&#xD;
but nothingworse than this (lid he suspect.&#xD;
Yet so well did 'he master himself, when he en-&#xD;
tered Mr. Farnham's room, the latter might have&#xD;
believed he had been told nothing which he had&#xD;
not known a lifetime. The invalid answered his&#xD;
visitor's inquiries as to his health, by bitter comi-&#xD;
plaints, which would have told any one not ac-&#xD;
quainted with the sad history, that he had been&#xD;
by far more sinned against than sinning--that he&#xD;
had been the chief suflfrer, and now in spite of&#xD;
all his commiands to the contrary, his worst ene-&#xD;
my-the destroyer of his happiness-hadfound a&#xD;
hospitable shelter beneath his roof.&#xD;
Mr. Phelps listened with great caution, that&#xD;
not by ia look should he betray his knowledge of&#xD;
the affair.&#xD;
"Your daughter has toll me something of&#xD;
this, but she says then maan is too feeble to leave&#xD;
his bed !  You, Mr. Farnham, who are not&#xD;
over strong, ought to feel common pity for the&#xD;
miserable fellow, even it he is a villain. Besides&#xD;
this don't seem  the matter of first importance&#xD;
to be considered now-and that too should teach&#xD;
you to be a little leas severely just, andi a little&#xD;
more merciful towards the erring, for you can't&#xD;
have forgotten the time when I plead with you&#xD;
to deal gently with this son of yours who was&#xD;
accused of a crime of, which I believe him as&#xD;
innocent as was I myself, and the sequel proved&#xD;
him more so, for I can't help feeling that I was&#xD;
partially responsible for iiy son's dissipated&#xD;
recklessness ! Yet you remimniber, you turned a&#xD;
deaf ear to all I had to say, pretending you felt it&#xD;
would be injustice to the boy not to punish him&#xD;
as such a crime merited. Well, you had your&#xD;
way, and we have seen the consequence partially!&#xD;
May heaven grant that we see nothing more&#xD;
serious than we have already-that before a,&#xD;
much longer time passes, the wanderer may be&#xD;
broughtlback to us; and, Mr. Farnham, don't you&#xD;
think we should endeavour that this lesson be&#xD;
not lost upon us-that it teach us ,o lean even&#xD;
weakly, if you choose so to call it-to the side of&#xD;
mercy, rather than execute too severe justice 1"&#xD;
Mr. Phelps spoke in a reproving tone, and the&#xD;
invalid listened as one not at all comfortable.&#xD;
His answer was that of an overbearing spirit be-&#xD;
reft of power.  -&#xD;
"None could have supposed that letter a for-&#xD;
gery. I am not the only one, Mr. Phelps, who&#xD;
was compelled to acknowledge it must be the&#xD;
work of him whose name it bore--besides, how&#xD;
was I to know anything of the young mnaun. But&#xD;
had I, was it more unnatural in inc believing hium&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7319-00000052"/>&#xD;
The sick man said something in a complain-&#xD;
ing tone of his child's unkindness and disobedi-&#xD;
ence,but Mr. Phelps by avery few words silenced&#xD;
him, and at the end of an hour the invalid had.&#xD;
learned the folly of trying to deceive his partner,&#xD;
and although he did not cease his complainings,&#xD;
did not give up declaring himself very badly&#xD;
treated--his authority completely outraged, and he&#xD;
the most unhappy of all fathers; yet little by&#xD;
little he yielded to Mr. Phelps' propositions with&#xD;
regard to the immediate steps to be taken, and&#xD;
before he was left to his rest he had consented to&#xD;
his partner making as full a statement of the un-&#xD;
fortunate matter as he should deem proper or&#xD;
necessary, to be inserted in the principal journals&#xD;
of the whole country, concluded by the offer of&#xD;
"five thousand dollars reward" for any correct&#xD;
and positive information of the lost Wilson Har-&#xD;
ley, alias Wilson Farnham.&#xD;
When this was accomplished, Mr. Phelps de-&#xD;
clared his determination to hasten back to the&#xD;
&#xD;
Quite unconscious of the importance into&#xD;
which he had suddenly grown, even among those&#xD;
who had before scarcely known of his existence,&#xD;
Wilson rowed his boat down the river with a&#xD;
light-hearted joyousness which would have scan-&#xD;
dalised many a sentimentalist. That he had been&#xD;
very unhappy he would not have denied; and that,&#xD;
too, from the unprovoked injuries which he had&#xD;
received when doing his best to gain for himself&#xD;
an honorable position, by performing faithfully&#xD;
and uprightly his duty towards others-but the&#xD;
gloaming hour had passed, and full of health mor-&#xD;
ally and mentally, he was ready to receive the joy-&#xD;
ous sunlight and rejoice in it ! David, who was&#xD;
not yet sufficiently recovered to assist his com-&#xD;
panion in his labors, or even to endure the fa-&#xD;
tigue connected with the journey, unless cared for&#xD;
with the greatest tenderness, reclined upon the&#xD;
comfortable bed which had been spread for him,&#xD;
and shielded from the sun's scorching' rays, as&#xD;
well as the chilling winds of morning and evening,&#xD;

have suffered such injuries as you have!''   be home again.&#xD;
A moment Wilson was silent and thoughtful,   David could scarcely wonder at this agitation,&#xD;
then he replied,                             but he could not prevent its giving hin iinxiety,&#xD;

THE MITHERLESS BAIRN.&#xD;

'1&#xD;
&#xD;
to the sad remembrance of the past, threatened to&#xD;
be almost too much for him to endure! Yet,&#xD;
David knew how useless would be anything he&#xD;
could say, so he watched him sileptly, seeming all&#xD;
the time occupied with his own thoughts.,&#xD;
When at length the cars stopped at the depot&#xD;
where the two travelers were to leave them,&#xD;
Wilson aroused himself again, and attended to&#xD;
the removing of their baggage with more pres-&#xD;
ence of mind than could be expected of him.&#xD;
The lad whom h9 engaged to take him and his&#xD;
companion home, eyed him very narrowly, but al-&#xD;
though he had seen him hundreds of times before,&#xD;
five years had made too great a change to leave&#xD;
the boy much chance of recognizing him ; but&#xD;
wh 'n David came out to get-into the carriage the&#xD;
youth was no longer at a loss to make out his man.&#xD;
"Gracious goodness, David McDonald, you've&#xD;
come home at last, have you? Well, I guess the&#xD;
folks at home won'tbe sorry to see you, for they'd&#xD;
near about given you up as a goner! Here these&#xD;
many weeks your father's been wearing such a&#xD;
face as made a feller's heart ache but to look at&#xD;
it! But you aint lookin' dreadful ruggid-guess&#xD;
vou aint had the easiest times in the world, eh ?"&#xD;
David could not repress a smile at this quaint&#xD;
greeting, but the lad - was one who had known&#xD;
him for years, and the interest which was mani-&#xD;
fest by his remarks, was upon this long acquain-&#xD;
tance warrantable, besides Ezekiel Jones, which&#xD;
was his name, or as he was familiarly known,&#xD;
"Young Zeke," was the oddity of the village and&#xD;
neighborhood, and David thought his drolleries&#xD;
might not have a bad effect upon Wilson at this&#xD;
time, and his answer but invited the youth to&#xD;
push the conversation further.&#xD;
"Yes, Zeke, I've been a lodg time.away-much&#xD;
longer than I should have been, but for sickness-&#xD;
I suppose they have been anxious at home-when&#xD;
did you see my father, Zeke ?"&#xD;
"I seen him yesterday, he was jest coming' out&#xD;
of the post office! I thought he must a' earn&#xD;
something' awful he looked so bad; but when I&#xD;
asked him, he said 'No, Zeke, not a word from&#xD;
David yet!' and oh! my, his voice made a feller&#xD;
feel awful, 'twas a'most as if he'd seen you&#xD;
dead !"&#xD;
"Poor Father !" was David's ejaculation, and&#xD;
then he asked, "are they all well at home, do you&#xD;
know, Zeke ?"&#xD;
"Well, yes, I guess all perty tolerable that's&#xD;
there-they was the last I heard anything said&#xD;
'bout it !"&#xD;
"And are not all at home that are there usually?'&#xD;
"Well, yes, all but Mary, your sister, and you&#xD;
I guess; I ain't heard of any of the rest being&#xD;
away !"&#xD;
Wilson had not seemed particularly interesteZ&#xD;
in what the boy had to say, but David saw hi&#xD;
face change in its expression at this last item o&#xD;
information, and he was not sorry they had hi&#xD;
upon something which was of importance enoug&#xD;
to turn him from his own thoughts, besides it wa&#xD;
such an unusual thing for Mary to be from home&#xD;
the intelligence surprised him not a little.&#xD;
"Are you sure Mary is not at home, Zeke?'&#xD;
was David's inquiry.&#xD;
"Gracious, yes,I think I ought to be, if there'&#xD;
any believin' what the folks say ! for its bee&#xD;
town talk these last tew weeks-every bod&#xD;
&#xD;
-IL&#xD;
&#xD;
e&#xD;
&#xD;
31s&#xD;
&#xD;
seems to think" she's the main spoke in the&#xD;
wheel, up to your house!'&#xD;
"And they aint very far from right !" was Da-&#xD;
vid's earnest answer.; "but do you know where,&#xD;
my sister has gone, that she stays so long?"&#xD;
"No, I don't know where it is-Iv'e heard 'um&#xD;
tell the name of the place, but its a jaw-break-&#xD;
er, so I wouldn't try to speak it, but its way off&#xD;
som:'ers your brother 'Jim came and took her&#xD;
away! I don't knew as I ort to tell," and the&#xD;
youth glanced at Wilson; "but you must a' earn&#xD;
of it afore this time, the papers have had noth-&#xD;
in' else in 'um for the last tew months, so I&#xD;
can't see where's the hurt of speakin.' She&#xD;
went off to help take care of that Mr. Farnham;&#xD;
he's awful sick they say, and the old feller too&#xD;
who told lies about his wife, they say he ain't&#xD;
a goin' to live much .longer, and I'm sure no-&#xD;
body'll cry when h'a dead."&#xD;
" Mary gone to take care of Mr. 'Farnham!"&#xD;
was David's exclamation more to himself than'&#xD;
to his informant,&#xD;
Wilson said nothing, but his faced expressed&#xD;
an impatient anxiety; under other circumstances&#xD;
he might have hesitated to listen to the town gos-&#xD;
sip with regard to Mary's movements, but now&#xD;
information, no matter how.it was gained, must&#xD;
be had, and he would have asked to hear more,&#xD;
had not the boy shrewdly guessing he had hit up-&#xD;
on something the travelers had not yet heard of,&#xD;
found it impossible to deny himself the luxury&#xD;
which nearly all of this class so much enjoy-be-&#xD;
ing the first to tell a startling piece of news. He&#xD;
was not certain as to who was David's compan--&#xD;
ion, but the possibility of its being the much&#xD;
talked of Wilson, made it more impossible for&#xD;
the boy to leave to another the rare treat of tell-&#xD;
ing the wonderful story; yet his natural delicacy-&#xD;
for none in their natural state are destitute of this&#xD;
property-made him hesitate a little as to how&#xD;
he was to commence, but it was only for a mo-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
"Why, yes; you see it wasn't such an unnat-&#xD;
ural thing neither-mother says it wasn't! She&#xD;
can't have any love for Mr. Farnham, I dare say,&#xD;
but this son of his'n that everybody takes on so&#xD;
about-he was amost like a brother to her and&#xD;
you too! Then the idear of his offering five&#xD;
thousand dollars to anybody 't'll bring him home!&#xD;
nuff to make a-feller independent for life! I'd&#xD;
thought it would a been cheaper to a cared some-&#xD;
thin' for him when he had him safe at home, but&#xD;
then there's no 'countin for taste, that's what&#xD;
the books say, I 'blieve; andbooksisright some-&#xD;
times. But then ain't it awful strange how things&#xD;
turn sometimes! It makes a body anost laugh,&#xD;
'to think of the 'pinions of people. Now, I&#xD;
shan't forget it as long as I live, for mother'&#xD;
1 was awful mad about folks medl'in with what&#xD;
they didn't know nothin about, and what was&#xD;
none their business, neither. They said when all&#xD;
that happened in the city, you know-that about&#xD;
h the money being' took from Mr. Phelps-&#xD;
s that  your  father might a know'd    better&#xD;
, than such a child from   the streets to take,&#xD;
that he never had a right look, and any-&#xD;
body of common sense would a know'd the boy&#xD;
would never come to any good! Then when it&#xD;
s come out ever so longafter that it was another&#xD;
n awful mean feller. that took the money, they&#xD;
y was sort o' still-yet once in a while you see one&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
f&#xD;
&#xD;
eww...r.r..r.++. ..a.                                                 - -  c +r..--                                                          --&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MITHERI&#xD;
that thought folks hadn't got no memories, and&#xD;
would sry---they always knowed it was all a lie!&#xD;
Then when this come out 'bout him being the son&#xD;
of this awful rich Mr. Farnhamn, they wasn't a&#xD;
bit s'pried, though they could talk of nothing&#xD;
else from mornin till night; they would declare&#xD;
anybody that had eyes, might a seed from the&#xD;
very fust that he belonged to no common breed,&#xD;
That made mother mad---as though he was any&#xD;
better fur havin a rich father! Well, here we&#xD;
are, almost to your gate. No, David McDonald,&#xD;
you needn't be feelin in your pocket, for I shant&#xD;
take nothin; I'll be paid next time I see your&#xD;
father, by one sight of his face. I'll take care of&#xD;
the things, you both go along."&#xD;
It was well that their arrival at the McDonald&#xD;
house brought the loquacious Zeke to a close, for&#xD;
the subject was one upon which he was not at&#xD;
all likely to become tired, and both of his com-&#xD;
panions had lost all disposition to question or in-&#xD;
terrupt him, for it was very plain to them there&#xD;
was something very wonderful to be learned, and&#xD;
they both felt the propriety of waiting to hear it&#xD;
from those to whom it was a matter of more than&#xD;
a curious interest.&#xD;
The reception of these two young men in their&#xD;
home was too full of heart-felt rejoicing to be&#xD;
described. ' The father, who had begun to believe&#xD;
himself bereft of not only their long absent Wil-&#xD;
lie, but also of the prop of his declining years, his&#xD;
true-hearted David, wept tears of gladness, while&#xD;
grandma found it too much for her to bear with&#xD;
composure, and after one kiss of welcome to each,&#xD;
she stole into her own room, that none should wit-&#xD;
ness her struggling with her emotions; and with&#xD;
the younger members of the family there was no&#xD;
lack of feeling in their glad greeting.&#xD;
It was a very long time before any one was&#xD;
composed enough to speak quietly of the matter&#xD;
which was weighing upon the minds of all, but&#xD;
when at last all became more quiet, and Mr. Mc-&#xD;
Donald, assisted by the boys and Amy, gave Wil-&#xD;
lie and David a full account of the disclosures&#xD;
made by Wilson Danforth, their surprise was too&#xD;
great to adnit of any other emotion for some&#xD;
time. Suddenly, a new idea seemed to strike&#xD;
David--&#xD;
"What did they say of this strange being, fa-&#xD;
ther-what was his look? Scant gray hair, a&#xD;
gray beard, and a face that looked as though it&#xD;
it had been in the grave ?"&#xD;
"Those were not the words, Davie, but still&#xD;
very much the same meaning. But why do you&#xD;
ask so eagerly and so particularly?"  Mr. Mc-&#xD;
Donald asked this in an eager way.&#xD;
"Because we have seen him, father. It is the&#xD;
same, Willie-the same wild being you saved&#xD;
from  starvation and helped upon his journey!&#xD;
Don't you'recognize him ? Willie, Willie, I will&#xD;
never doubt again, that in all things which may&#xD;
seem to us evil there may be a hidden blessing.&#xD;
Now I see why we were detained there; why&#xD;
my illness was necessary, for without- it we&#xD;
should have been home when this strange man&#xD;
needed succor-this Wilson Danforth-and he&#xD;
must have died, and with him all this knowledge&#xD;
would have perished."&#xD;
"And but for my poor mother I could I wish it&#xD;
had !" was Wilson's earnest answer.&#xD;
"No, my boy, no, no, I can't hear you say this,"&#xD;
the father answered quickly. "You have seen&#xD;
&#xD;
LESS BAIRN.                             103&#xD;
enough of the world to know how to use wealth-&#xD;
if that was the only consideration, but it is not;&#xD;
you have a sister, the child of your darling mooth-&#xD;
er, who will soon be left wholly orphaned and&#xD;
will need a brother's love and proteotion-yi&#xD;
should thank Heaven that you have learned all&#xD;
this-for her sake if not for your own !"&#xD;
"And you will love her so, Willio, for she nm4&#xD;
be a dear girl-Jemmie says she is beautiful and&#xD;
so good, and then if she wasn't, she would never&#xD;
have been willing for old Neptune to have gone&#xD;
with you on that Christmas morning!   Won't&#xD;
you bring her soon to see us, Willie? for I shall&#xD;
never be satisfied till I have seen her-a real he-&#xD;
roine as she is."&#xD;
This the enthusiastic Amy said in her own&#xD;
cheering, loving way, which never failed to inthe&#xD;
all happier who caie within its influence, and&#xD;
Wilson began to feel its effect before ho was&#xD;
aware of it-for this child was indeed a ray of&#xD;
cheering sunlight in her hemue.&#xD;
Before the family retired that night, it was&#xD;
agreed that on the following morning Wilson&#xD;
should set out on this journey to see his father,&#xD;
before he should die. His heart rebelled soie-&#xD;
what at first, but finally he yielded for his sister's&#xD;
sake; and there was another in that louse aiding&#xD;
his sister in her duties as nurse, whom his heart&#xD;
bounded with impatient love to greet once more.&#xD;
David was to accompany him as far as the city,&#xD;
should his strength seem suflicient for it When&#xD;
morning should come.&#xD;
In this case love proved itself good tonie, and&#xD;
all were compelled to acknowledge David much&#xD;
improved by hisuight's rest, and so, without much&#xD;
opposition, he accompanied Wilson a short dis&#xD;
tance on his journey. But he felt no dispositi, i&#xD;
to go beyond the city, and the welcome which he&#xD;
received from Delia Phelps would have made&#xD;
him forgetful of ten fold the fatigue le suffered&#xD;
in his short ride, though it was strange how nuch&#xD;
nursing and care this tond girl and her mother&#xD;
found him requiring, and how long a time ie&#xD;
needed for rest before they could consent to his&#xD;
venturing to return home.&#xD;
The day was drawing to a close when the car-&#xD;
riage containing Wilson stopped at the cottage&#xD;
gate where terminated his journey. 1Ie looked&#xD;
anxiously out for soine dear, familiar face to&#xD;
welcome him, but all was as quiet as had the&#xD;
cottage containedno living thing. Passing into&#xD;
the yard, he reached the side door before any one&#xD;
discovered him.  Then a face was seen at the&#xD;
window, and before the traveler had time for&#xD;
thought, the hands of Mary McDontald were&#xD;
within his own.  Was it strange that for a time&#xD;
everything else was forgotten in the joy of this&#xD;
meeting ? Mary was the first to recollect where&#xD;
they were.&#xD;
"Come in here, dear Willie" (how   familiar&#xD;
and sweet that name sounded to her; as she led&#xD;
the way, she repeated it mentally again and again,&#xD;
before going on with what she hai to say). As&#xD;
he seated himself, she laid her hand in his once&#xD;
more-and now there was something very touch-&#xD;
ing in the expression of her face, and the move-&#xD;
ment seemed full of sympathy.&#xD;
"Have you heard,Willie," she said in little more&#xD;
than a whisper, "have you heard what has come?"&#xD;
" What do you mean, Mamy ? ,you need not&#xD;
fear to speak !&#xD;

THIS MITHERLESS BAIRN.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Death was before you, Willie-how I wish&#xD;
you could have come before; he-your father-&#xD;
so longed to see you, but he is gone; he died this&#xD;
morning !"&#xD;
Wilson leaned his forehead upon the loving&#xD;
hand which lay within his own. After all there&#xD;
was a feeling at his heart-not of sorrow-but&#xD;
this had been his father, and he was dead,-dead&#xD;
without realizing his one strongest wish-with-&#xD;
out looking upon his son-the son of her he-had&#xD;
so cruelly wronged.&#xD;
Mary's other hand was passed very gently over&#xD;
his bowed head-the touch, slight as it was,&#xD;
aroused him-and looking up into her face,.which&#xD;
was much the same he had left it five years be-&#xD;
fore, he said:&#xD;
" My sister.,Mamy, this must be a bitter trial&#xD;
to her, yet she must even in this hour have a wel-&#xD;
come for a brother who has so long been a, wan-&#xD;
derer.- I cannot regret that I am  spared this&#xD;
meeting with one, who, if living, I know I could&#xD;
only regard with bitternesi-now that he is dead&#xD;
all is forgiven. 3ut, my sister. my heart yearns&#xD;
towards her, Mamy, and I would sootheand com&#xD;
fort her in this hour.&#xD;
Mary had no voice to reply by a single word,&#xD;
but hurrying out of the room she a moment after&#xD;
re-entered it, accompanied by Henrietta. The&#xD;
tear-stained face of the latter told that her sor-&#xD;
row was such as had caused bitter weeping, and&#xD;
at sight of her brother she found it impossible to&#xD;
restrain her over-wrought feelings, and long and&#xD;
passionately she wept; but her tears brought&#xD;
with them composure, and for the first time in her&#xD;
life she felt the joy of having a brother.&#xD;
After a little time Mary stole out of the room,&#xD;
and left to themselves, the brother and sister&#xD;
talked of him who had but a few hours since&#xD;
passed from earth; but their words were gentle,&#xD;
pitying ones, nothing of bitterness and reproach.&#xD;
Then Henrietta told her brother of another one,&#xD;
who waited to see him before leaving the world.&#xD;
It was the man for whom he had been named-&#xD;
the man who had done them a great injury, and&#xD;
at last had been the means of restoring the wan-&#xD;
deret to his right. Wilson expressed his readi-&#xD;
ness to visit the bedside of this strange being&#xD;
withbiut further delay, and as his sister led the&#xD;
way into the sick room, he peered eagerly at the&#xD;
bed upon which was stretched the emaciated&#xD;
form. One glance was enough. David bad&#xD;
been correct in his conjecture. It was indeed&#xD;
the same being who had been his guest in his&#xD;
prairie home! The agitation of the invalid,&#xD;
when he recognized in his name-sake the young&#xD;
man who had saved. his life when he was near&#xD;
perishing from fatigue and hunger, made both his&#xD;
watchers tremble for the result, but after a time&#xD;
he rallied-his hour had not yet come.&#xD;
While these two were in the .ick chamber,&#xD;
James McDonald, accompanied by Mr. Phelps,&#xD;
returned from the neighboring town, where'they&#xD;
had been to make all necessary arrangements for&#xD;
the burial, which in accordance with Mr. Farn-&#xD;
ham's request was to take place in this quiet&#xD;
country town, where had passed the last few&#xD;
months of his life, and where he had been hum-'&#xD;
bled to the very dust. When told by Mary-who&#xD;
met them before they reached the cottage door-&#xD;
of Wilson's arrival, Mr. Phelps' inquiring res-&#xD;
ponse was&#xD;
&#xD;
"And David ?"&#xD;
"Is safely cared for by your wife and daugh-&#xD;
ter!" was Mary's answer.&#xD;
"Then we may indeed rejoice ;" was the earn-&#xD;
est reply.&#xD;
"We will not even complain by wishing they&#xD;
had come sooner--poor Willie, he has been spared&#xD;
a sad trial and he has had enough of them, so let&#xD;
us not regret it!," Both Mr. Phelps and Mamy&#xD;
felt to say "amen" to this brotherly sentiment&#xD;
from James, and then Wilson himself appearing&#xD;
at the door, both turned their attention to him.&#xD;
Ere another day dawned death had the'second&#xD;
time entered the cottage, and these old men, who&#xD;
had in life been mortal enemies, were laid to their&#xD;
last rest on the same day, by the hands of those&#xD;
who had most severely suffered by their evil doings,&#xD;
and these two were their only mourners.&#xD;
One.year from this time, there was gathered&#xD;
in the snug farm home of David McDonald a&#xD;
joyous party-a three-fold wedding party!  Wil-&#xD;
son Farnham-the wealthy and courted-claim-&#xD;
ed from this dearly loved circle for his bride, the&#xD;
quiet, gentle Mary whom he had loved since first&#xD;
his eyes rested upon her little child-face. And&#xD;
proud was he of bestowing his sister upon the&#xD;
manly James, who had taken good care to win&#xD;
the heart of her he had long loved. As to the&#xD;
third pair it would not be difficut to guess who&#xD;
they were,:when Delia Phelps' promise to David&#xD;
-to give him her hand whenever he should ask it,&#xD;
so he who had so cruelly suffered by her brother,&#xD;
was there to witness the bands-shall be recall-&#xD;
ed! The news of the death of this unhappy&#xD;
brother had, however, compelled David to mas-&#xD;
ter his impatience for a year's delay.&#xD;
His bride was not all that the young farmer&#xD;
won by the long search after the lost Wilson-by&#xD;
right the five thousand dollars reward belonged to&#xD;
him, and he did not refuse to take it. Wilson&#xD;
and Henrietta could well spare double that sum&#xD;
from their abundance, but this was all that he&#xD;
would receive.&#xD;
Among all of the party there was much of curi-&#xD;
osity to see the bridal gift which W ilson had for his&#xD;
sister. David evidently knew what it was, for&#xD;
he would give a very conscious look whenever it&#xD;
was spoken of, but to not even Delia did he be-&#xD;
tray the secret, for, as he told her, it was not his.&#xD;
Of one thing they were certain-for size it was&#xD;
not diminutive, for it required a box almost large&#xD;
enough to contyia the young man himself to hold&#xD;
it. Henrietta was not the least curious one of the&#xD;
company, but she forbore questioning, and when&#xD;
the moment came and the cover was removed&#xD;
from the case, displaying her dear old Neptune,that&#xD;
she had never ceased to remember with fondness,&#xD;
the swelling of her loving heart, would not allow&#xD;
her to speak her thanks-but her brother read all&#xD;
she would have spoken in her affectionate eyes,and&#xD;
he felt that his noble sister appreciated the act-&#xD;
that to her the gift was of more value than could&#xD;
have been any other, no matter how costly.&#xD;
And after this life of severe trial, he who had&#xD;
nearly seventeen.years before sought the grave&#xD;
of his darling mother to die-he who had felt&#xD;
himself homeless, friendless, motherless, was bless-&#xD;
ed with home and friends and enough of this&#xD;
world's goods, but what he valued more than all&#xD;
p he rest ten times told-with the love of his true-&#xD;
hearted wife.&#xD;
