Entered according to Act of Congreas in the year 1863, by&#xD;
AI J. RANDOLPH3,&#xD;
ia the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States, for the Eouthern&#xD;
District of New York.&#xD;
&#xD;
To those who are married, and discontented, and misera-&#xD;
ble, unhappy, and generally wretched, and who want to see&#xD;
a better state of things-which is herein shown how to be&#xD;
done-to -those who love, and are capable of being loved ;&#xD;
and those whom nobody loves, yet who are daily dying&#xD;
therefor, this book comes as a potent teacher of "HO W TO&#xD;
DO IT." The book abounds in Magic, certainly ; yet that&#xD;
Magic is of the White. not the Black sort ; and the extraor-&#xD;
dinary Talisman recommended herein to be frequently used&#xD;
(and which was first found by the Rosicrucians in the great&#xD;
Temple, on its Brazen door, within the Golden Triangle, just&#xD;
previous to the " Dream within a dreain," in PART FIsT,) is&#xD;
one, than which the whole record of Magic since Chaldea's&#xD;
early days, shows not an equal. It has moved mountains,&#xD;
turned rivei's, softened human hearts, and absolutely forced&#xD;
people to " Love one another."  But let me caution you!&#xD;
Be silent and secret; use it carefully, and you will find most&#xD;
extraordinary results will follow. I have frequently used it,&#xD;
and know its mighty power. To such as need this Talisman&#xD;
it and this Book is dedicated.&#xD;

A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE AUTHOR.&#xD;
Tuis is Mr. Randolph's eighth work, including a few nov-&#xD;
els (the last and best f which is still in manuscript), most&#xD;
of which have gone forth under a nom de plume. He has&#xD;
at last decided to drop all disguises, since it is now conceded&#xD;
on all hands that a man, even if of mixed blood, has certain&#xD;
rights that are bound to be respected. As an earnest, effect-&#xD;
ive and eloquent speaker, Mr. Randolph has long since taken&#xD;
a very high and enviable rank. The American Press years&#xD;
ago conceded this; while that of London freely accorded him&#xD;
a very high position, notwithstanding he was only heard in&#xD;
England when advocating a cause, at that time very unpopu-&#xD;
lar across the Atlantic. What they think of this "Dumas&#xD;
of America," as the Press style him, who know him best,&#xD;
may be gathered from the following, selected at random from&#xD;
hundreds of similar import:&#xD;
"Mr. P. B. Randolph has been personally known to me&#xD;
for many years. My relations with him have been intimate;&#xD;
and I desire to say of him, as I do with great pleasure, that&#xD;
he possesses remarkable abilities, which, in the face of im-&#xD;
mense discouragements, have been remarkably cultivated.&#xD;
"He has a laudable ambition to occupy some field of labor&#xD;
which shall be worthy of his capacity, and give fair scope to&#xD;
his intellect ; but the slight taint of Indian and African blood&#xD;
in his veins hs proved to be, and is an effectual barrier to&#xD;
-                                                                  the attainment, in almost all directions, of positions of honor,&#xD;
trust and distinction, which few men are better qualified to&#xD;
fill.&#xD;
"He is an original thinker, a logical reasoner, an eloquent&#xD;
speaker-has a memory that forgets nothing; and if he could&#xD;
obtain service, or could be aided to take the field in behalf&#xD;
of his brethren (which he desires to do), I have no doubt h&#xD;

would not only acquit himself with credit to his friends, but&#xD;
be of great service to the cause he may thus advocate.&#xD;
"A man having the inherent ability and versatility which&#xD;
distinguishes Mr. Randolph, yet who, by our social laws, is&#xD;
so effectually shut out from most fields of honorable effort,&#xD;
has large claims upon men who can really aid him. I ar-&#xD;
dently hope he may find such, who will secure to him the&#xD;
opportunity he seeks.  Respectfully,  L. M. TAYLOR.&#xD;
UTICA, November 5th."&#xD;
The following gentlemen of Utiea join in the above testi-&#xD;
monial: H. S. Nichols, H. P. Perry, W. P. Perry, W. B.&#xD;
Taylor, and A. J. Watts.&#xD;
" PREIRBoRo', August 29th*.&#xD;
"Mn. P. B. RANDOLPH: &#xD;
" DEAR FRIEND-I have heard you deliver a discourse on&#xD;
Intenperance, and one on Slavery. They were characterized&#xD;
by your remarkably original, strong and fruitful mind. I&#xD;
hope you will be frequently invited to speak on these im-&#xD;
portant subjects.   Your friend,     GERRIT SMITH."&#xD;
in addition to the above letter, Mr. Smith gives Mr. Ran-&#xD;
dolph the following general certificate :&#xD;
"The bearer, Mr. P. B. Randolph, is endowed with high&#xD;
intellectual powers. I have heard his public advocacy on&#xD;
Temperance and Freedom. His speeches abounded in origi-&#xD;
nal thought and beautiful imagery.    GERRIT SMITH.&#xD;
"PETERBORo', October 31st."&#xD;
These are recommendations of which any young man in&#xD;
the land might be proud. Mr. R. has never devoted him-&#xD;
self to the discussion of the single topic of Negro Slavery, or&#xD;
Indian wrongs. He said: " There are enough to do this. I&#xD;
will carve out a road to Fame alone, and will challenge the&#xD;
man of the dominant race on his own ground-the fields of&#xD;
Science, Literature and Philosophy." He has done it, despite&#xD;
the bitter and malignant opposition of certain self-styled&#xD;
Philosophers and Progressives, whose lead he refused to&#xD;
&#xD;
vi&#xD;
&#xD;
follow or acknowledge. They will be attended to hereafter.&#xD;
To-day Mr. Randolph's position as a thinker, orator and&#xD;
author, is a proud and impregnable one. His books sell by&#xD;
thousands ; halls are thronged whenever he speaks; and on&#xD;
many points of thought and philosophy, his opinions are&#xD;
authoritatively quoted.  He is " coming up."  Says the&#xD;
Brooklyn Star, in the report of a speech by him:&#xD;
"Mr. Randolph, by invitation of Mr. Beecher and others,&#xD;
will deliver one more speech on Temperance before he leaves&#xD;
us for his western home. He speaks at the Brooklyn Insti-&#xD;
tute to-morrow (Tuesday) evening, at 71 o'clock. When this&#xD;
man first appeared among us as a Temperance speaker, his&#xD;
power and eloquence surprised everybody who heard him.&#xD;
The effects produced by him upon his audiences was such&#xD;
that an almost universal doubt prevailed as to whether he&#xD;
could maintain the same power thereafter; but - this opinion&#xD;
has given way to the - conviction ' that,' to quote Mr.&#xD;
Beecher-' The Lord has raised up a powerful instrument&#xD;
for His service in the Temperance cause in this man.'. He&#xD;
is evidently a man of unusual ability and great mental re-&#xD;
sources. Time after time has he been called upon to speak&#xD;
at a moment's warning, and without the slightest prepara-&#xD;
tion, and yet every speech is a decided improvement on the&#xD;
last, even when the first was universally acknowledged to be&#xD;
excellent. Mr. Randolph takes rank with our best speakers,&#xD;
but is not an imitator of any. His style is unique and en-&#xD;
tirely original, somewhat resembling J. B. Gough's. inasmuch&#xD;
as his speeches abound in bold figures and magnificent ima-&#xD;
gery, brilliant flights, rich anecdote, large philanthropy, and&#xD;
uncompromising hostility to wrong in any shape. It can&#xD;
but infuse new life into the noble movement to have such&#xD;
standard-bearers as Gough in Europe, and Randolph in this&#xD;
country. Mr. R. is a Son of Temperance, and belongs to&#xD;
Washington Division, No. 4, which also claims as members&#xD;
several of the first men of this section of the State. Go to&#xD;
the Institute early, for otherwise it may be difficult to obtain&#xD;
seats."&#xD;
Mr. Randolph has traveled much, having crossed the At-&#xD;
lantic eight times, and journeyed in Scotland,Ireland, England,&#xD;
&#xD;

France, Egypt, Arabia, Syria, Turkey, Greece and Italy, be-&#xD;

thrice rejected golden offers to visit India. China and Japan.&#xD;
It is but little credit to say that he is in many respects the&#xD;
best educated man of mixed blood in this country ; but he&#xD;
is solely self-learned. " Genius," says a great authority, " is&#xD;
ever faulty."  Mr. Randolph had his faults; but they were&#xD;
of the head, never of the heart. His principal one seems to&#xD;
have been the withering exposure of the clap-trap and blas-&#xD;
phemy enunciated from the Platform at Utica in September,&#xD;
1858. Davis, the pretended seer and clairvoyant, who is&#xD;
about as clairvoyant as a German sausage or a brick wall,&#xD;
has never forgiven him the damage he sustained at Mr.&#xD;
R.'s hands on that occasion, and Mr. R. is glad of it-glad&#xD;
to have escaped the influence of Davis's funny and ridiculous&#xD;
doctrines about "1Summer lands" and "Sirloin dispatches."&#xD;
Mr. R. some time -since established a laboratory in Utica,&#xD;
New York (where it is still conducted by M. J. Randolph),&#xD;
for the preparation of his three celebrated "Positive Medi-&#xD;
cines," so famed in New York and Boston. Many are the&#xD;
victims of sexual abuse and excess, spermatorrhoea and scro-&#xD;
fula, and diseases of the blood and brains, who will yet, as&#xD;
in times past, bless the day, and thank Heaven that they&#xD;
ever heard of Mr. R., and in exchange for the five or ten dol-&#xD;
lars paid as fees, recovered the priceless boon of manhood,&#xD;
womanhood, health and strength. Still, with all his chemi-&#xD;
cal and other labors, Mr. R. finds time to travel and to&#xD;
write, and will continue so to do until "Life's fitful fever is&#xD;
o'er."                                      G. D. S.&#xD;

THE ROSICRUCIAN'S STORY.&#xD;
-art -tst.&#xD;
LARA,&#xD;
HE used to pace rapidly up and down the deck for a min-&#xD;
ute or two, and then, suddenly striking his forehead, as if a&#xD;
new thought were just pangfullyooming into being at the&#xD;
major foci of his soul, he would throw himself prone upon&#xD;
one of the after seats of the old "Uncle Sam," the steamer&#xD;
in which we were going from San Francisco to Panama, and&#xD;
there he would lie, apparently musing, and evidently enjoy-&#xD;
ing some sort of interior life, but whether that life was one&#xD;
of revery, dream, or disbodiedness, was a mystery to us&#xD;
all, and would have remained so, but that on being asked, he&#xD;
very complaisantly satisfied our doubts, by informing us that&#xD;
on such occasions he, in spirit, visited a place not laid down&#xD;
in ordinary charts, and the name of which was the realm of,&#xD;
" Wotchergifterno," which means in English, "Violinist's&#xD;
Meadow" (very like " Fiddler's Green"). When not pacing&#xD;
the deck, or reclining, or gazing at the glorious sunsets on&#xD;
the sea, or the still more gorgeous sun-risings on the moun-&#xD;
tains, he was in the habit of-catching flies which flies he&#xD;
would forthwith proceed to dissect and examine by means of&#xD;
a microscope constructed of a drop of water in a bent broom-&#xD;
wisp. Gradually the man became quite a favorite with both&#xD;
passengers and officers of the ship, and not a day passed hut&#xD;
a crowd of ladies and gentlemen would gather around him to&#xD;
listen to the stories he would not merely recite, but compose&#xD;
as he went along, each one containing a moral of more than&#xD;
ordinary significance. It was apparent from the first that the&#xD;
man was some sort of a mystic, a spiritualist, or some such&#xD;
out-of-the-ordinary style of person, because every thing he&#xD;
said or did bore an unmistakable ghostly impress. He was&#xD;
sorrowful withal, at times, and yet no one on the ship had&#xD;
a greater or more ,humorousrwof spirits. In the midst,&#xD;
however, of his brightest sallies, he would suddenly stop&#xD;
short, as if at that moment his listening soul had caught the&#xD;

&#xD;
jubilant cry of angels when God had just pardoned some&#xD;
sinful, storm-tossed human soul.&#xD;
One day, during the progress of a long and interesting con-&#xD;
versation on the nature of that mysterious thing called the&#xD;
human soul, and in which our fellow passenger had, as usual,&#xD;
taken a leading part, with the endeavor to elicit, as well as&#xD;
impart, information, he suddenly changed color, turned almost&#xD;
deathly pale, and for full five minutes, perhaps more, looked&#xD;
straight into the sky, as if gazing upon the awful and ineffa-&#xD;
ble mysteries of that wierd Phantom-land which intuition&#xD;
demonstrates, but cold reason utterly rejects or challenges for&#xD;
tangible proof. Long and steadily gazed the man; and then&#xD;
he shuddered-shuddered as if he had just received some&#xD;
fearful solution of the problem near his heart. And I shud-&#xD;
dered also-in pure sympathy with what I could not fairly&#xD;
understand  At length he spoke ; but with bated breath,&#xD;
and in tones so low, so deep, so solemn, that it seemed as&#xD;
though a dead, and not a living man, gave utterance to the&#xD;
sounds: "Lara ! Lara ! Ah, Lovely ! would that I had&#xD;
gone .hen--that I were with thee now !" and he relapsed&#xD;
into silence.&#xD;
Surprised, both at his abruptness, change of manner and&#xD;
theme-for ten minutes before, and despite the solemnity of&#xD;
the conversational topic, he had been at a fever heat of fun&#xD;
and hilarity-I asked him'what he meant.  Accustomed, as&#xD;
we had been, to hear him break in upon the most grave and&#xD;
dolorous talk with a droll observation which instantly pro&#xD;
yoked the most unrestrainable, hilarious mirth ; used, as we&#xD;
had been to hear him perpetrate a joke, and set us all in a&#xD;
roar in the very midst of some heart-moving tale of woe,&#xD;
whereat our eyes had moistened, and our pulses throbbed&#xD;
tumultuously, yet I was not, even by all this, prepared for&#xD;
the singular characteristic now presented. In reply to my&#xD;
question, he first wiped away an involuntary tear, as if&#xD;
ashamed of his weakness ; then raised his head, and ex-&#xD;
claimed:&#xD;
"Lava! Lara! The Beautiful One !"&#xD;
"What of her ?" asked Colbert, who satopposite him, and&#xD;
who was deeply moved at his evident distress, and whose&#xD;
curiosity, as that of us all, was deeply piqued.&#xD;
"Listen," said he, "and I will tell you;" and then, while&#xD;
we eagerly drank in his words, and strove to drink in their&#xD;
strange and wondrous meaning, (first warning us that what"&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ROsICRUCIAN'S STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
he was about to say was but the text of something to be&#xD;
thereafter told,) he leaned back upon the taffrail, and while&#xD;
the steamer gently plowed her way toward Acapulco and far-&#xD;
off Panama, said:-&#xD;
Fleshless, yet living, I strode through the grand old hall of&#xD;
a mighty temple. I had been compelled to climb the hills&#xD;
to reach the gates that bar the Gates of Glory, and now within&#xD;
my heart strange pulses beat the while. I found myself upon&#xD;
the verge of a vast extended plain, stretching outo the In'ni-&#xD;
tudes, as it seemed, through the narrow spaces wherein the&#xD;
vision was not obstructed by certain dense, convolving vapor-&#xD;
clouds that ever and anon rose from off the murky breast ot&#xD;
waters of the river of Lethe, that rolled hard by and skirted&#xD;
the immense prairie on and over which I proposed to travel,&#xD;
on. my way from Minus to Plus-from Nothing to Some-&#xD;
thing, from Bad to Good, and from Better to BEsT-traveling&#xD;
toward my unknown, unimagined Destiny-traveling from the&#xD;
Is -toward the shall Be. And I stood and mutely gazed-&#xD;
gazed at the dense, dark shadows rolling murkily, messily&#xD;
over the. plain and through the spaces-dim shadows of dead&#xD;
worlds.' No sound, no foolfall, not even mine own-not an&#xD;
echo broke the Stillness. I, was alone !-alone upon the vast&#xD;
solitude-the tremendous wastes of an unknown, mysterious,&#xD;
unimagined Eterne-unimagined in all its fearful stillitude !&#xD;
Within my bosom there was a heart, but no pulse went from&#xD;
it bounding through my veins; no throb beat back respon-&#xD;
sive life to my feeling, listening spirit. I and my Soul were&#xD;
there alone; we only-the Thinking self, and the Self that&#xD;
ever knows, but never thinks-were there. My heart as ,not&#xD;
cold, yet it was more : it was, I felt, changed to solid stone-&#xD;
changed all save one small point, distant, afar off, like unto&#xD;
the vague ghost of a long-forgotten fancy ; and this seemed to&#xD;
have been the penalty inflicted on me for things done by me&#xD;
while on the earth ; for it appeared that I was dead, and that&#xD;
my soul had begun an almost endless pilgrimage-to what?--&#xD;
to where ?  A penalty ! And yet no black memory ofe d=&#xD;
handed crime haunted me or lurked in the intricacie of the&#xD;
mystic wards of my deathidefyin soul;-and I strodlloxie&#xD;
adown the uncolumned vistas of-the grand old temple-  tem-&#xD;
ple whose walls were builded of flown Seconds, whose teasel-&#xD;
ated pavements were laid in sheeted fHours, whose window# on&#xD;
one side 'opened upon the Gone ages, and on the other ipo n&#xD;
the Yet to Be; and its sublime turrets pieced the elds,&#xD;

THE RoSICRUCIAN S STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
which roll over and mantle the hoary summits of the grey&#xD;
Mountains of Time ! And so I and my Soul walked through&#xD;
this temple by ourselves-alone !&#xD;
With clear, keen gaze, I looked forth upon the Vastness,&#xD;
and my vision swept over the floors of all the dead years ;&#xD;
yet in vain, for the things of my longing were not there. I&#xD;
beheld trees, but all their leaves were motionless, and no ca-&#xD;
roling bird sent its heart-notes forth to waken the dim&#xD;
solitudes into life and music-which are love. There were&#xD;
stately groves beneath the arching span of the temple's massy&#xD;
dome, but no amphian strains of melody fell on the ear, or&#xD;
filled the spaces, from their myriad, moveless branches, or&#xD;
front out their fair theaters. All was still. It was a palace&#xD;
of frozen tones, and only the music of Silence (which is vocal,&#xD;
if we listen well) prevailed ; and I, Paschal the Thinker, and&#xD;
my Thought'-strange, uncouth, yet mighty but moveless&#xD;
thought---were the only living things beneath the expansive&#xD;
dome. Living, I had sacrificed all things-health, riches,&#xD;
honor, fame, ease, even Love itself, for Thought, and by&#xD;
Thought had overtopped many who had started on the race&#xD;
for glory long ere my soul had wakened to a consciousness of&#xD;
itself-which means Power. In life I had, so it seemed,&#xD;
builded stronger than I thought, and had reached a mental&#xD;
eminence-occupied a throne so lofty-that mankind won-&#xD;
dered, stood aloof, and gazed at me from afar off; and by&#xD;
reason of my thought had gathered from me, and thus con-&#xD;
demned the Thinker to an utter solitude, even in. the most&#xD;
thronged and busy haunts of men ; and I walked through&#xD;
earth's most crowded cities more lonely than the hermit of&#xD;
the desert, whose eyes are never gladdened by the sight of&#xD;
human form, and through the chambers of whose brain no&#xD;
human voice goes ringing. Thus was it on earth ; and now&#xD;
that I had quitted it forever, with undaunted soul, strong&#xD;
purpose, and fearless tread, assured of an endless immortality,&#xD;
and had entered upon the life of Thinking, still was I alone.&#xD;
Had my life, my thinking, and my action on thought been&#xD;
failures ? The contemplation of such a possibility was bitter,&#xD;
very bitter-even like unto painful death-and yet it seemed&#xD;
true that failure had been mine-failure, notwithstanding men&#xD;
by thousands spoke well of me and of my books-the children&#xD;
of my thought-and bought my books in thousands. Fail-&#xD;
ure . My soul rejected the idea in utter loathing. For a&#xD;
moment the social spirit, the heartness of my nature over-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ROSICRUCIAN's STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
shadowed Reason, and caused me to forget that, even though&#xD;
confined by dungeon walls, stricken with poverty, deformity.&#xD;
sin or disease--even though left out to freeze in the cold&#xD;
world's spite-yet the Thinker is ever the world's true and&#xD;
only King. I had become, for a moment, oblivious of the fact&#xD;
that on all four of Earth's Continents my name was quoted&#xD;
as a standard authority upon all questions concerning Man--&#xD;
as he was, as he is, and as he is to be ; and of the still greater&#xD;
one, that it was inscribed upon the fadeless scrolls in the Tem-&#xD;
plea of the Rosie Cross ; and that, to be a true Rosicrucian&#xD;
was to engender the envy, spleen and hatred of little men&#xD;
and women, while winning the love of few who knowledge&#xD;
have, and wisdom to increase it,--therefore that failure was&#xD;
an impossibility. Rosicrucians never fail!&#xD;
But now, as I slowly moved along, I felt my human nature&#xD;
was at war with the God-nature within, and that Heart for&#xD;
awhile was holding the Head in duress. I longed for release&#xD;
from Solitude ; my humanity yearned for association. and&#xD;
would have there on the breast of the great Eterne - given&#xD;
worlds for the company of the lowliest soul I had ever be&#xD;
held - and despised, as I walked, the streets of the cities of&#xD;
the far-off earth. I yearned (ah. Father, how I yearned!) for&#xD;
human society and affection, and'could even have found bliss-&#xD;
ful solace with---a dog ! just such a dog as, in times past, I&#xD;
had scornfully kicked in Cairo and Stamboul. Even a dog&#xD;
was denied me now-all affection withheld from me-and in&#xD;
the terrible presence of its absence I longed for death, forget-&#xD;
ful again that Soul, which is very life, can never die. I&#xD;
longed for death-that deeper extinguishment which might&#xD;
sweep the soul from being, and crown it with limitless, peace-&#xD;
ful, eternal Night-forgetful. again, that the Memories of&#xD;
Soul must live, though the rememberer cease to be, and that&#xD;
hence Horrors would echo through the universe-- children&#xD;
mourning for their suicidal parent, and that parent myself!&#xD;
And then I lay me down beneath a tree in despair -a tree&#xD;
which stood out all alone from its fellows, in a grove hard&#xD;
by--a tree all ragged and lightning-scathed  an awful monu-&#xD;
ment, mute, yet eloquently proclaiming to the wondering on-&#xD;
looker that God had passed that way, in fierce, deiflc wrath,&#xD;
once upon a time, in the dead ages, whose ashes now be-&#xD;
strewed the floors of that mighty temple of Eterne.&#xD;
It was dreadful, very dreadful, to be all alone.  True,&#xD;

THE ROSICRUCIANIS STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
bition, and the raging flames of earthly passion, could no longer&#xD;
mar my peace. Pain, such as mortals feel, was unknown;&#xD;
nor could disease rack my frame, or disturb the serenity of&#xD;
my external being -for I was immortal, and could laugh)&#xD;
these and Death itself to scorn ; and yet a swifter anguish, a&#xD;
more fearful suffering, was mine. I wept, and my cries gave&#xD;
back no outer sound, but they rang in sombre echoes through&#xD;
the mighty arches, the bottomless caverns, the abyssmal deeps&#xD;
of Soul-my soul-racking it with torments, such as only&#xD;
thinking things, poor lonely souls, can feel. There flowed vast&#xD;
pain-billows over the gossamer nerve-net of my spirit. Such&#xD;
is the lot of- every daughter of the Starbeam - such are the&#xD;
disciplines of every quenchless son.of Day -destined citizens&#xD;
of the Farther Empyrean. And these are the signs by which&#xD;
ye may know them, on the earth or the other side of Time.&#xD;
Sleep came-sweet Sleep --deep and strange; and in it&#xD;
1 dreamed. Methought I still wandered gloomily beneath the&#xD;
vast arches of the grand old hall, until at last, after countless&#xD;
cycles of ripe years had been gathered back into the treasury&#xD;
of the Supreme Grand Master, I stood before a solid, massive&#xD;
door, which an inscription thereabove announced as being the&#xD;
entrance into the Vestibule leading into the Garden of the&#xD;
Beatitudes. This door was secured by a thousand locks, be-&#xD;
sides one larger than all- the rest combined. 1 Every one of&#xD;
these locks might be opened,'but the opener could not pass&#xD;
through unless he unfastened the gigantic master lock having&#xD;
ten thousand bolts and wards. A doom ! Once more a sort&#xD;
of despair seized on and fully enshrouded my soul, in this&#xD;
dream which was not all a dream; for to achieve an entrance&#xD;
through the gate without the master-key was a task, so said&#xD;
the inscription, that would require the labors of human ar-&#xD;
mies for periods of time utterly defying man's comprehen-&#xD;
sion-so many were the difficulties, so vastly strong the&#xD;
bolts.  Sadly, mournfully, I turned away, when, as if by&#xD;
chance-forgetting that there is no such thing as Chance-my&#xD;
eyes encountered a rivetless space upon the solid, brazen&#xD;
door-a circular space-around the periphery of which was.&#xD;
an inscription running thus : "MAN ONLY FAILS THROUGH&#xD;
FEEBLENEss OF WILL !"  Within this smooth circle was the&#xD;
semblance of a golden triangle, embracing a crystalline globe,&#xD;
winged and beautiful, crowned with a Rosicrucian cypher,&#xD;
while beneath it stood out, in fiery characters the single&#xD;
&#xD;
THE RoSIcRUcIAIs STORY.             15&#xD;
word   fairi !"  The very instant I caught the magic signifi-&#xD;
cance of these iyme inscriptions, a new Hope was begotten&#xD;
in the majorfoci of my soul; Despair fled back to its dismal&#xD;
solitude, and in the excess of joy I passed into&#xD;
A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM.&#xD;
What a change ! During my slumber it seemed that I had&#xD;
been transported to the summit of a very lofty mountain,-yet&#xD;
still within the Temple. By my side stood an aged and&#xD;
saintly man, of most regal and majestic presence. He was&#xD;
clad in an oriental garb of the long-gone ages. and his flowing&#xD;
robes were bound to his waist by a golden band, wrought&#xD;
into the similitude of a shining serpent-the sacred emblem&#xD;
of eternal wisdompsand the insignia of mental power. Around&#xD;
his broad and lofty brow was a coronet of silver, dusted with&#xD;
spicul- of finest diamond. On the sides of the center were&#xD;
two scarabei, the symbol of immortal man; and between&#xD;
them was a pyramid, on which was inscribed a mystical&#xD;
character which told, at the same time, that his name was&#xD;
Ramus the Great--the same known historically as Thothmes,&#xD;
or Thotmor the Third, King of all Egypt, in the 18th dynasty,&#xD;
and sixty-ninth Chief or Grand Master of the Superlative&#xD;
Order of Gebel Al Maruk-since known, in Christian lands,&#xD;
as the Order of the Brethren of the. Rosie Cross, and now&#xD;
known in America and Europe, where it still thrives, as the&#xD;
Imperial Order of Rosicrucia.&#xD;
This royal personage spake kindly to me, and his soft&#xD;
tones fell upon the hearing of my soul like words of pardon&#xD;
to the sense of sinners at the Judgment Seat. " Look, my&#xD;
son," said he, at the same time pointing toward a vast pro-&#xD;
cession of the newly risen dead-a spectral army, on the&#xD;
sides of the Mountain of Time. slowly, steadily, mournfully&#xD;
wending their way toward that part of the temple I had&#xD;
quitted previous to the commencement of this dream within&#xD;
a dream. Said the man at my side: "Yonder host of pil-&#xD;
grims are men and women who are seeking, as thou hast&#xD;
sought, to unbar the Gates of Glory. that they may pass&#xD;
through them into the delightful Garden of the Beatitudes.&#xD;
It is one thing to be endowed with Intellectual Strength,&#xD;
Knowledge and Immortality ; it is another to be Wise and&#xD;
Happy. The first is a boon granted to all the children of&#xD;
earth alike ; the last can only be attained by integral devel-&#xD;
opment - by self-endeavor, by innate goodness and God-ness&#xD;

externally manife-ted -and this in material and aromal&#xD;
worlds the same. Man is man and womar is woman, wher-&#xD;
ever they may be ! The true way to the garden lies not&#xD;
through Manifestation Corridor, but through the Hall of Si-&#xD;
lence ! and each Aspirant must open the door for himself&#xD;
alone, by himself alone, and by and through no other. Fail-&#xD;
ing to enter, as thou hast failed, each must turn back, and.,&#xD;
like thee, come hither to Mount Retrospect, and entering into&#xD;
the labyrinths within its sides, must search through the cells&#xD;
of Memory for the triple key, which alone can unbar the&#xD;
Gate. and admit to the Beautiful Garden ! Remember ! De-&#xD;
spair not! Try !" and in an instant the Phantom man turned&#xD;
from me, and with outstretched armns, and benignance beam&#xD;
ing from every feature, hied him toward the head of the as&#xD;
sending army.&#xD;
Again I stood alone, not now in despondency and gloom,&#xD;
but in all the serene strength of noble, conscious Manhood-&#xD;
not the manhood actual, but the certain and glorious possi-&#xD;
bility thereof. My soul had grown. It was aware of all its&#xD;
past short-comings, failures, hatreds--one of which, toward&#xD;
one man who had done me deadly wrong, still survived --&#xD;
stronger than ever, now that I was across the Bridge of&#xD;
Hours, and had become a citizen of the inner land -a wan-&#xD;
derer through Eternity. That hate was as immortal as my&#xD;
deathless soul. Will it ever be ?  And yet I had ever meant&#xD;
well. All was calm in my spirit, save this single awful&#xD;
hatred. In this spirit, with this consciousness--not of deep&#xD;
malignance, but of outraged Justice -I began to look for the&#xD;
mysterious key ; and as 1 looked, an instinct told me that&#xD;
the key must consist of three grand human virtues, and their&#xD;
corresponding deeds, held and done before I left the shores&#xD;
of Time and embarked upon the strange and mystic sea where-&#xD;
on my soul's fortunes were to be encountered ; and I certainly&#xD;
had a dread that my hatred of the man would prove a rock&#xD;
upon which I yet might founder.&#xD;
And so I searched, and at last seemed to have found&#xD;
what I sought-Virtues clothed in      word-names ; and&#xD;
thereupon I wished myself once more before the brazen Gate.&#xD;
Instantly, as if by the higher magic, the wish was realized,&#xD;
and I stood before it, on the same spot formerly occupied.&#xD;
The first inscription, the symbols and circle had disappeared,&#xD;
and in their stead was another circle, containing fiery lines,&#xD;
which lines were these: "Speak, for thou shalt be heard&#xD;

Tell aloud what thou hast done to elevate thy fellow-men,&#xD;
and to round out the angles of thine own soul. Whom hast&#xD;
thou uplifted, loved, hated ? Sp :ak, and when the words&#xD;
containing the key are spoken, the door will yield, and thou&#xD;
mayest pass the Threshold !"&#xD;
The writing slowly faded, and left nought but a surface,&#xD;
but that surface as of molten gold. I spoke aloud my claim&#xD;
to entrance, and, to my astonishment, my voice rang out,&#xD;
shrill and clear, through the vaults and arches of the mighty&#xD;
dome towering far above my head. "I have suffered from&#xD;
infancy-been opposed from the cmdle to maturity-been&#xD;
hated, robbed, slandered on all sides, yet pushed forward in&#xD;
defiance of all, until I reached a height so proud and lofty&#xD;
that nothing more could earth give me. Self-educated, sor&#xD;
row instructed, I achieved triumphs where millions failed ;&#xD;
have reaped laurels and grasped the keys of fame, and&#xD;
laughed at my folly afterward, because what is fame? A&#xD;
canker, gnawing out one's life when living, disturbing his&#xD;
repose when dead-not worth a straw ! But in all this,&#xD;
despite the ending, I have set an example, by following which&#xD;
man might elevate himself, and society be improved, and its&#xD;
constituents realize the bliss of moving in loftier spheres of&#xD;
usefulness !"  While giving voice to these, truth-facts, I&#xD;
firmly expected to see the gate fly'open at their conclusion.&#xD;
But what was my horror and dismay to see that it moved&#xD;
not at all, while the echoes of my speech gave back in fright-&#xD;
fully resonant waves of sound the last word, " USEFULNESS."&#xD;
Not being able to. think of any nobler achievements, I&#xD;
cast my eyes groundward, but on again raising them I be-&#xD;
held across the clear space on the door, the single word&#xD;
" TRY."&#xD;
Taking heart again, I said, ".Alone 1 sought the secret of&#xD;
restoring health to the sick, and I gaveit freely to the world.&#xD;
'T'he most precious balsams, restoratives, means of relief and&#xD;
cure, I dispensed with a free hand, and gave priceless medica-&#xD;
ments to all,without money, without price. I cured sick bodies&#xD;
by ministering to the soul, and the converse. I have made&#xD;
grand efforts to redeem mankind from sloth, sin, ignorance,&#xD;
and have ever upheld the honor of the Cross, and the sweet&#xD;
religion it symbolizes. I have hated but one man, but that I&#xD;
could not help. Striving ever to upraise the veil that hides man&#xD;
from himself, in the effort I have been misapprehended. my&#xD;
motives impugned, and my reward, instead of gratitude, has&#xD;

been poverty, slander and disgrace. In the strife of human&#xD;
redemption, I have constantly been heedless to every call save&#xD;
that of human duty, and in obeying the behests of a nobler&#xD;
destiny, I have been regardless of all worldly distinction,&#xD;
have ignored wealth, fame, honorable place in the world's&#xD;
esteem, and have even been deaf to the calls of love !"&#xD;
I ceased, and again the vaults threw back my last word,&#xD;
and all the arches echoed "LOVE !"&#xD;
The gate moved not, but once more appeared upon the&#xD;
golden lozenge on the door the word " TRY !" in greater&#xD;
brightness than before, while it seemed to the hearing sense&#xD;
of my spirit that akthousand velvet whispers-low, so low,&#xD;
gently cadenced back "LOVE."&#xD;
t I have rebuked the immoral. humbled the lofty and&#xD;
overbearing, exposed deception, comforted the mourner, re&#xD;
deemed the harlot, reformed the thief, fed the orphan and&#xD;
upheld the rights and dignity of Labor !"&#xD;
Still the door rpoved not, but again the echoes gave back&#xD;
the last word, " LABOR !"&#xD;
"I have preached immortality to thousands, and prevailed&#xD;
on them  to believe it; have written of, and everywhere pro-&#xD;
claimed its mighty truths, and its still more mighty signifi-&#xD;
cance, having been its acknowledged champion for years. I&#xD;
have beaten the skeptic, confirmed 'the wavering, reassured&#xD;
the doubting, and through long and bitter years, in both&#xD;
hemispheres of the globe, from sea to sea, have declared that if&#xD;
a man die he shall live again ; thus endeavoring to overthrow&#xD;
error, establish truth, banish superstition, and on their ruins&#xD;
lay the deep and broad foundations of a better faith !'  As&#xD;
if myriad voices of the dead and gone chimed out my last&#xD;
syllable, there rang through the spacious halls and corridors&#xD;
of the Temple, the sublime word, 'Faith !" and instantly&#xD;
the bolts appeared to move within their iron wards. Con-&#xD;
tinuing, I said: " I have ever endeavored, save in one single&#xD;
instance, to foster, and in all cases have a spirit of forgive-&#xD;
ness." This time there was no mistake. The thousand bolts&#xD;
flew back, and the ponderous brazen gate moved forward and&#xD;
back, as if swayed, like a vast curtain, by a gentle wind ;&#xD;
while a million silvery voices sang gloriously, -- In all cases&#xD;
have a spirit of forgiveness -'&#xD;
Joyously I tried again, intuition plainly telling me that&#xD;
only one thing more was necessary to end my lonely pil-&#xD;
grimage, and exalt me to the blessed companionship of the&#xD;

"I have fallen fionman's esteem in pursuance of what&#xD;

land. and un ise zealots brought shame and bitter reproach&#xD;
against and upon it. Lured by a false eloquence, I yielded&#xD;
to the fasciations of a specious sophistry, and for a while&#xD;
my soul languished under the iron bondage of a powerful&#xD;

word escaped my lips, than the massive portals flew wide&#xD;
open, disclosing to my enraptured gaze such a sight of super,&#xD;

"Lara! Beautiful Lara, I obey thee ! Wait for me, love.&#xD;
I am coming soon !" I cried, as she slowly retreated, and&#xD;
the gate closed again. "Not yet, not yet," I cried, as with&#xD;
extended arms I implored the beauteous vision to remain-&#xD;
but a single instant longer. But she was gone. I fell to&#xD;
the ground in a swoon. When I awoke again, I found the&#xD;
night had grown two hours older than it was when I sat&#xD;
down in my chair in my little chamber in Bush street, the&#xD;
little chamber which I occupied in the goodly city of the&#xD;
Golden Gate."&#xD;
Thus shake the Rosicrucian. We were all deeply moved&#xD;
at the recital, and one after the other we retired to our&#xD;
rooms, pondering on the story and its splendid moral. Next&#xD;
day we reached Acapulco, and not till we had left and were&#xD;
far on our way toward Panama, did we have an opportunity&#xD;
of listening to the sermon to the eloquent text I have just&#xD;
recounted.&#xD;
At length he gave it, as nearly as I can possibly reproduce&#xD;
it, in the following words :&#xD;

&#xD;
AND so you like the text, do you? Very well, I will now&#xD;
see how much better you will be pleased with the sermon.&#xD;
Listen:-&#xD;
I cannot endure, I will not stand this any longer. Here&#xD;
am I, yet a young man-in the very prime and heyday of&#xD;
life, and I do believe that I shall be a regular corpse in less&#xD;
than no time, if a change for the better don't very soon take&#xD;
place in my family ; that's just as certain as "open and shut."&#xD;
She, ah, she, is killing me by inches-the vampire ! Would&#xD;
that 1 had been thirty-five million of miles the other side of&#xD;
nowhere the day I married her. Don't I, though! Betsey-&#xD;
Betsey Clark is killing me ! No love, no kindness, not a soft&#xD;
look, never a gentle smile. 0, don't I wish somebody's fune-&#xD;
ral was over ; but not mine; for I feel quite capable of&#xD;
loving, of being happy yet, and of making somebody's daugh-&#xD;
ter happy likewise. People may well say that marriage is a&#xD;
lottery-a great lottery; for, if there's one thing surer than&#xD;
another, then it is perfectly certain that I have drawn the&#xD;
very tallest kind of a blank ; and hang me, if it wasn't for&#xD;
the disgrace of the thing, if I wouldn't run off and hitch&#xD;
myself for life to one of the Hottentots I have read about ;&#xD;
for anything would be better than this misery, long strung&#xD;
out. 0, don't I wish I was a Turk ! When a feller'sa Turik&#xD;
he can have ever so many wives-and strangle off all of 'em&#xD;
that don't suit him or come to Taw-as they-ought to. Bully&#xD;
for the Turks I I wish I knew how to turn myself. If I did,&#xD;
I'd be the biggest kind o' one afore mornin'!&#xD;
Such was the substance of about the thousandth soliloquy,&#xD;
on the same subject, to the same purport, delivered by Mr.&#xD;
Thomas W. Clark, a friend of mine-the Rosicrucian's-&#xD;
during the last seven years of his wedded life.&#xD;

&#xD;
22&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ROSIORUCIAN'S STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
Tom Clark delivered himself of the contented and philan-&#xD;
thropic speech just recited, on the morning of a fine day, just&#xD;
after the usual morning meal-and quarrel with his-wife,&#xD;
shall I say ?-female attendant would better express the&#xD;
relation defacto  Mr. Clark was not yet aware that a woman&#xD;
is ever just what a husband's conduct makes her-a thing&#xD;
that some husbands beside himself have yet to learn. Every&#xD;
day Tom's and his wife's food was seasoned with sundry and&#xD;
divers sorts of condiments other than those in the castor.&#xD;
There was a great deal of pickle from his side of the gay and&#xD;
festive board, in the shape of jealous, spiteful inuendoes; and&#xD;
from her side much delicate sauce piquante, in the form of&#xD;
sweet allusions to a former husband of his dulcinea, whom&#xD;
that lady declared to have been "the very best husband that&#xD;
was ever sent to"--a premature grave by a vixen-she might&#xD;
have added, truthfully, but did not, finishing the sentence&#xD;
with, "be loved by a tender, gentle, loving wife"-like her !&#xD;
The lady had gotten bravely over all her amiable weaknesses&#xD;
long ago. "GentleI what are tigresses ?  Tender ! what is&#xD;
a virago?  So far the man. Now for his mate.&#xD;
Scarcely had her lord-" Mr. Thomas W.," as she was&#xD;
wont to call him-gone out of the house, and slammed the&#xD;
door behind him, at the same time giving vent to the last&#xD;
bottle full of spleen distilled and concocted in his soul, than&#xD;
"cMrs. Thomas W.," or poor Betsy Clark, as I prefer to call&#xD;
her-for she was truly, really pitiable, for more reasons than&#xD;
one, but mainly because she had, but would not exercise her&#xD;
common sense sufficiently to make the best of a bad bar-&#xD;
gain-threw herself upon the bed, where she cried a little,&#xD;
and raved a good deal, to the self-same tune as of yore. Get-&#xD;
ting tired of both these delightful occupations very soon, she&#xD;
varied them by striking an attitude before a portrait of the&#xD;
dear defunct-badly executed-the portrait, not the man,&#xD;
whose name she bore when she became Mistress Thomas W.&#xD;
This picture of a former husband Tomn Clark had not had the&#xD;
courage or sense enough to put his foot through, but did have&#xD;
bad taste sufficient to peruit it to hang up in the very room&#xD;
where he liveit and ate, and where'its beauties were duly and&#xD;
daily expatiated upon, and the virtues of its original lauded&#xD;
to the skies, of course to the intense delight of Mr. Clark.&#xD;
Madam had a tongue-a regular patent, venom-mounted&#xD;
back-spring and double-actioned tongue, and, what is more,&#xD;
knew well how to use it when the fit was on, which, to do&#xD;

avail herself of to amplify the merits of the deceased, espe-&#xD;
cially in presence of such visitors as chance or business&#xD;
brought to their house, all to the especial delectation of ler&#xD;
livig spouse, Mr. Thomas W. Clark.&#xD;
Just look at her now ! There she is, kneeling at her&#xD;
shrine, my lady gay, vehemently pouring forth the recital of&#xD;
her wrongs--forgetful of any one else's, as usual with tl e&#xD;
genus grumbler--dropping tears and maledictions, now on&#xD;
her own folly, then on the devoted head of him she hal&#xD;
promised to love, honor and obey. Mr. Clark, fruit-grow F.&#xD;
farmer and horse-dealer. Exhausted at length. she winds up&#xD;
the dramatic scene by invoking all the blessings of all the&#xD;
saints in all the calendars on the soul of him whose coun-&#xD;
terfeit presentment hung there upon the wall.&#xD;
If this couple did not. absolutely hate each other, they&#xD;
came so near it that a Philadelphia lawyer would have been&#xD;
puzzled to tell t'other from which, and yet nobody but them-&#xD;
selves had the least idea of the real state of things---these&#xD;
undercurrents of married life that only occasionally breach&#xD;
through and extensively display themselves in the presence&#xD;
of third parties. In the very nature of the case, how absurd&#xD;
it is for outsiders to presume to know the real status of&#xD;
affairs-to comprehend the actual facts which exist behind,&#xD;
the curtains of every or any married couple in the land. Hy-&#xD;
men is a fellow fond of wearing all sorts of masks and dis-&#xD;
guises; and it often happens that tons of salt exist where&#xD;
people suppose nothing but sugar and lollypops are to be&#xD;
found.&#xD;
Tom and his wife-the latter, especially-pretended to a&#xD;
vast deal of loving kindness, 0, how great, toward each&#xD;
other-and they were wise-in the presence of other people.&#xD;
You would have thought, had you seen them billing and&#xD;
coo inglike a pair of "Turkle Doves"-to quote the "Bard&#xD;
aldwinsville"-that there never was so true, so perfect a&#xD;
union as their own; and would not have entertained the&#xD;
shadow of a doubt but that they had been expressly- formed&#xD;
for each other from the foundations of the world. if not be-&#xD;
fore. No sooner did they meet--before folks, even after the&#xD;
most trifling absence-than they mutually fell to kissing and&#xD;
dearing," like two swains just mated, all of which made&#xD;
fools wonder, but wise people to grieve. Physical manifesta-&#xD;

24             THE ROsIcRUcIAN's STORY.&#xD;
tions are not quite Love's methods ; and it is a safe rule that&#xD;
those who most ape love externally, have less of it within-&#xD;
and in private, so great a difference is there between Behind&#xD;
and Before, in these matters of the heart, and people's eyes.&#xD;
Billing and cooing before folks acts as a nauseant upon sen-&#xD;
sible men and women, and in this case it did upon not a few&#xD;
of the better class of the city of Santa Blarneeo, within a few&#xD;
miles of which Clark lived,~and from which we sailed a few&#xD;
days ago, you to go home, I to the Pyramids of Egypt, near&#xD;
wh ch I am to meet a conclave of Oriental Rosicrucians as&#xD;
soon as I get there.&#xD;
Betsey Clark gave a last, long, lingering look at the por-&#xD;
trait, saying the while: "Don't I wish you was' alive and&#xD;
back here again, my love, niy darling, my precious duck?"&#xD;
Lucky for him was it that such could not be; for had it been&#xD;
possible, and actualized, he would have been finely plucked,&#xD;
not to say roasted, stewed, perpetually broiled, and in every&#xD;
way done brown. " If you were here, I should be happy,&#xD;
because you was a man ; but this one (meaning Tom) bah !"&#xD;
and the lady bounced upon her feet, and kicked the cat by way&#xD;
of emphasis. She resumed: "I can't stand it, and I won't,&#xD;
there ! that's flat! I'm still young, and some people of sense&#xD;
tell me I am handsome-at least, good-looking. Pm certain&#xD;
the glass does, and no doubt there are plenty who would glad-&#xD;
ly link their lot with mine if he was only dead !" And she&#xD;
shuddered as the fearful thought had birth. "Dead ! I wish_&#xD;
he was ; and, true as I live, I've a great good mind to accom-&#xD;
plish my wish!!"  And again she shuddered.. Poor woman,&#xD;
,,he was indeed tempted of the devil ! As the horrible sugges-&#xD;
tion flashed across the sea of her soul, it illumined many a&#xD;
sleep chasinal abyss, of whose existence, up to that moment.&#xD;
he had been utterly unaware. The human soul is a fearful&#xD;
thing, especially when it stands bare before the Eternal Eye,&#xD;
vith myriad snake-forms-its own abnormal creation, writh-&#xD;
ng round and near it. A fearful thing ! And Betsey Clark&#xD;
trembled in the ghastly presence of Uncommitted Murder,&#xD;
whose glance of lurid flames set fire to her heart, and&#xD;
: corched and seared it with consuming heat. Its flashful&#xD;
light lasted but for a moment ; but even that was a world&#xD;
too long, for it illumined all the dark caverns of her soul,&#xD;
and disclosed to the horrified gaze of an aereal being which&#xD;
that instant chanced to pass that way-an abyssmal deep of&#xD;
Crime, Possibility so black and terrible, that it almost shriv-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ROSICRUOIAN'S STORY.            25&#xD;
elled the eyeballs and shrouded the vision of the peerless&#xD;
citizen of the upper courts of Glory.&#xD;
Suddenly the radiant Ileavenborn ceased its flight through&#xD;
the azure, looked pityingly earth and heavenward. heaved a&#xD;
deep and soul-drawn sigh, and stayed awhile to gaze upon&#xD;
the Woman and the Man.&#xD;
Human nature is a very curious and remarkable institu-&#xD;
tion ;'so is woman nature, only a great deal more so - espe-&#xD;
cially that of the California persuasion-you Bet ! Still it&#xD;
was not a little singular that Tom's wife's mind should have&#xD;
engendered (of Hate and Impatience) the precise thought&#xD;
that agitated his own at that very minute--that very identi-&#xD;
cal crime-thought which had just rushed into being from the&#xD;
deeps of his own spirit--twin monsters sibbilating "Mum--&#xD;
der!" in both their ears.&#xD;
There is as wonderful a sympathy between opposites and&#xD;
antagonists, indeed far greater, than between similarities-&#xD;
as strong attractions between opposing souls as in those fash-&#xD;
ioned in the same mould. True, this affirmation antagonizes&#xD;
many notions'among current philosophies and philosophers ;&#xD;
but it is true, notwithstanding, and, therefore, so much the&#xD;
worse for the philosophers.&#xD;
The same fearful thought troubled the waters of two souls&#xD;
at the same time, and each determined to do a little private&#xD;
killing on their own individual and separate accounts. As&#xD;
yet, however, only the designs existed. The plans were yet&#xD;
crude, vague, immature, and only the crime loomed up indis-&#xD;
tinctly, like a grim, black mountain through a wintry fog.&#xD;
The day grew older by twelve hours, but when the sunset&#xD;
came, ten years had fastened themselves upon the brows of&#xD;
both the Woman and the Man since last they had parted at&#xD;
rosy morn. Bad thoughts are famous for making men grow&#xD;
old before the weight of years has borne them earthward ;&#xD;
they wrinkle the brow and bring on decrepitude, senility&#xD;
and gray hairs, faster than Time himself can possibly whirl&#xD;
bodies graveward. The rolling hours and the circling years&#xD;
are less swift than evil thoughts of evil doing. Right doing,&#xD;
innocence, and well-wishing make us young ; bad thoughts&#xD;
rob us of youth, vivacity and manhood ! Let us turn to Mr.&#xD;
and Mrs. Thomas W.:&#xD;
Night was.on the mountain,&#xD;
Darkness in the valley,&#xD;
And only stars could guide them now&#xD;
In the doubtful rally.&#xD;

of             TUE RoSICRUcIAN'S STORY.&#xD;
There was a star hung out in the sky, and she had already&#xD;
determined to watch their destinies ; with what success,&#xD;
and in what manner, will be apparent before finishing my&#xD;
story-every word of which is true in one sense, if not pre-&#xD;
cisely in another.&#xD;
The sun had set, and slowly the moon was uprising--&#xD;
blessed Moon! -God's Left Eye, wherewith He at night over-&#xD;
looketh the thoughts and deeds of solitary men and solitary&#xD;
women - for only such are capable of crime--those only who&#xD;
a ad live 'alone-and many such there are, even at their&#xD;
w-n firesides, surrounded by their own families, own [llesh,&#xD;
own blood- fathers, mothers, wives (as times go), bus-&#xD;
lands (as they are conventionally called). Many there be&#xD;
who exist in dreadful solitudes in the very midst of human&#xD;
crowds-who live alone and pass through life, from the era-&#xD;
die to the grave, perfect strangers, perfect hermits, wholly&#xD;
unknowing, totally unknown  like interlopers on the globe,&#xD;
whose very right to be here all the world disputes. Friends,&#xD;
I have seen many such-have you'? These lonely people,&#xD;
these exotics, these insulars in the busy haunts of men (the&#xD;
teeming hives of commerce) -alone in earth's well-paced&#xD;
market-towns --in the very saturnalia of TRADE's gala days;&#xD;
and they are to be pitied, because they all have human,&#xD;
yearning hearts, filled to the brim with great, strangling&#xD;
sorrows ; and they have high and holy aspirations, only that&#xD;
the world chokes them down-crushes out the pure, sweet&#xD;
life God gave them. These are the Unloved ones; yet ought&#xD;
not to he, for are they not somebody's sons and daugh-&#xD;
ters'?  Yes ! Then they have rights ; and the first, greatest,&#xD;
highest right-of all is the right of being loved-loved by the&#xD;
people of the land - our world-cousins, for what we do, are&#xD;
doing, or have done; and to be loved, for the sake of the dear&#xD;
soul within, by somebody else's son or daughter.&#xD;
So think we of the Rosicrucian Order ; so one day will&#xD;
think the world without the Temple. In a book of mine,&#xD;
called " Dealings with the Dead," lately printed, I have given,&#xD;

manded. and as our Grand Council permitted, on the topic&#xD;
just touched upon.&#xD;

ing heart of Woman ; or sweeter, dearer still-a child, some&#xD;
glorious hero of a hobby-horse, some kitten-torturing Cora!&#xD;
Ah ! what a chord to touch. I am very fond of children-&#xD;
dear little godlings of the hour. Those who reciprocate af&#xD;
section truly, are too full of God to keep a devil's lQdging-house.&#xD;
It is a dear thing to feel the great truth-one of .osicrucia's&#xD;
truths-that nothing is more certain than that somewhere,&#xD;
perhaps on earth, perhaps in some one of the innumerable&#xD;
aromal worlds-star-spangles on God's diadem-or from&#xD;
amidst the mournful monodies in material creation-some&#xD;
one loves us, and that there goeth up a prayer. sweet-toned&#xD;
as seraph-harps, to Him for you, my weary brother, for you,&#xD;
my sister of the dark locks turning prematurely grey :&#xD;
'-Oh the little birds sing east, and the little birds sing west,&#xD;

Somebody loves us for ourselves' sake. Thank God for&#xD;
that !&#xD;
And the pale, silver shield of the moon hung out in the&#xD;
radiant blue, and myriad gods looked down through starry&#xD;
eyes upon this little world, as it floated, a tiny bubble&#xD;
on space's vast ocean ; and they spake through their eyes,&#xD;
and bade us all love the Supreme, by loving one another ;&#xD;
and they said, "Love much !"   Such is the whole duty&#xD;
of man. The moon, God's night-eye. takes note of all ye&#xD;
do, and is sometimes forced to withdraw behind cloud-veils.&#xD;
that ye may not behold her sweet features while she weeps&#xD;
at the sad spectacle of thy wrong doing !  Luna, gentle&#xD;
Luna, does not like to peer down into our souls, and there&#xD;
behold the slimy badness, which will ere long breed deeds of&#xD;
horror to make her lovely face more pale-things which dis-&#xD;
figure the gardens of man's spirit, and transform them into(&#xD;
tangled brakes, where only weeds and unsightly things do&#xD;
grow. And Luna has a recording angel sitting on her shield,&#xD;
whose duty is to flash all intelligence up to his deifie brain,&#xD;
in whose service she hath ever been. He is just, inexorably&#xD;
just, ever rewarding as man sinneth or obeys. And so it i&#xD;
poor policy to sin by night. It is equally so to sin by day;&#xD;

murder rankling in their hearts. Not a word was spoken,&#xD;
but they lay with throbbing pulses, gazing out upon the&#xD;
night, through a little window at the foot of the bed, for its&#xD;
upper sash was down. Gazing out upon the starry lamps&#xD;
that skirt the highways of the sky, beacons of safety placed&#xD;
there to recall and guide all stray and wandering souls back&#xD;
on their way to Heaven ! And silently looked at the stars as&#xD;
they twinkled and shimmered in the azure. The stars shone&#xD;
and strange, horrible, ghastly thoughts agitated the woman&#xD;
and the man. "Tom    might get sick, and he might die.'&#xD;
Isn't it possible to feed him with a little arsenic, or some&#xD;
other sort of poison, and not get caught at it? I think it&#xD;
iS. He, once dead, I shall be free-free as the air, and happy&#xD;
as the birds!"  Happyy! Think of it !&#xD;
"Is it not possible to push Betsey over the cliff; 'cciden-&#xD;
tally of course, and thus rid myself of her and misery&#xD;
together, and forever !" Forever ! Picture it! And thus&#xD;
they lay as the night wore on, two precious immortal souls,&#xD;
with rank Murder for a bedfellow.&#xD;
At the end of an hour's cogitation, both had reached the&#xD;

inviting little precipice, a trifle over four hundred feet deep,&#xD;

historian of the Order, the great Mirandolo, be not mistaken,&#xD;
our Brotherhood possesses the key that reveals the nature&#xD;

my own knowledge--for I am but in the fifth degree, there-&#xD;
fore do not know all these mysteries-there are Destinies in&#xD;
the stars. Well, on this particular night the star known as&#xD;
lHesper, she of the pale mild eye was looking straight into&#xD;
the room where lay the precious lovely pair, and it shone&#xD;
through the little window at the foot of the bed. The night&#xD;
was sultry-a little window--summer was in the ascendant&#xD;
and the upper sash was down. Remember this, the upper&#xD;
sash was down .    . .   . .   And now a strange thing&#xD;
occurred, a very strange and mysterious thing. Just as Tom&#xD;
Clark and his wire had been magnetized into a sortof restless&#xD;
sleep from gazing at the star-an uneasy, disturbed, nervous,&#xD;
but dreamless sleep-as if a heavy, thick and murky cloud&#xD;
just floated off a stagnant marsh, there descended upon the&#xD;
roof(f the house a pestilent, slimy mist, and it gathered&#xD;
over and about the roof; and it entered, rolling heavily, into&#xD;
the chamber, costing through that little window at the foot of&#xD;
the bed, the little window whose upper sash was down. It&#xD;
was a thick, dense, iron-greyish mist. approaching blackness&#xD;
only that there was a sort of turgid redness, not a positive&#xD;
color, but as if it had floated over the depths of hell, and&#xD;
caught a portion of its infernal luminosity. And it was thick&#xD;
and dark, and dense and very heavy ; and it swept and rolled&#xD;
and poured into the room in thick, voluminous masses-into&#xD;
the very room, and about the couch where tossed in uneasy&#xD;
slumber the woman and the man. And it filled the apart-&#xD;
ment, and hung like a pall about their couch ; and its fetor&#xD;
oppressed their senses; and it made their breath come thick,&#xD;
and difficult, and wheezing from their lungs. It was dread-&#xD;
ful! And their breath mingled with the strange vapor,&#xD;
apparently endowing it with a kind of horrid life, a sort of&#xD;
semi-sentience ; and gave it a very peculiar and fearful move-&#xD;
ment--orderly, systematic, gyratory. pulsing, movement-&#xD;
the quick sharp breath of the woman, the deep and heavy&#xD;
breath of the man. And it had come through the window&#xD;
at the foot of the bed, for the upper sash was down.&#xD;
Slowly, and with regular, spiracular, wavy motion, with&#xD;
gentle undulations, like the measured roll of the calm Pacific&#xD;
Sea, the gentle sea on which I am sailing toward the Pyra-&#xD;

maids and my Cora--six years old, and so pretty ! Pyramids&#xD;
six thousand years old, anl so grand ! Like the waves of&#xD;
that -sea did the cloud begin to move gyrally around bute&#xD;
chamber, hanging to the curtains, clinging to the wails ,bu&#xD;
as if dreading the moonlight, carefully avoiding the window&#xD;
through which it had come the little window at the foot of&#xD;
the bed-whose upper sash was down.          .  . Soon.&#xD;
very soon, the cloud commenced to change the axis of its move-&#xD;
ments, and began to condense into a large globe of iron-hued&#xD;
nebulas ; and it began a contrary revolution; and it floated&#xD;
thus, and swam like a dreadful destiny over the unconscious&#xD;
sleepers on the bed, after which it moved to the western side&#xD;
or end of the room, and became nearly stationary in an angle&#xD;
of the wall, where for a while it stood or floated, silent, ap-&#xD;
palling, almost motionless, changeless, still: At the end of&#xD;
about six minutes it moved again, and in a very short time&#xD;
assumed the gross, but unmistakable outline of a gigantic&#xD;
human form-an outline horrible, black as night, frowning&#xD;
human form-cut not sharply from the vapor, but still dis-&#xD;
tinctly human in its slapeness-but very imperfect, except&#xD;
the head, which was too frightfully complete to leave even a&#xD;
lingering doubt but that some black and hideous deviltry was&#xD;
at work in that little chamber ; and IT had entered through&#xD;
the window at the foot of the bed-the little window, whose&#xD;
upper sash was down. "And the head was infamous, horr-&#xD;
le, gurgonic ; and its glare was terrible, infernal, blasting,&#xD;
ghastly-perfectly withering in its expression, proportions,&#xD;
and its aspect. The THING, this pestilent thing was bearded&#xD;
with the semblance of a mass-a tangled mass of coarse grey&#xD;
iron wire. Its hair was as a serried coil of thin, long, venom-&#xD;
laden, poison-distilling snakes. The nose, mouth, chin and&#xD;
brows were simply ghastly, and its sunken cheeks were those&#xD;
of Famine intensified. The face was flat and broad, its lips&#xD;
the lips of incarnate hate and lust combined. Its color was&#xD;
the greenish blue of corpses on a summer battle-field, suffused&#xD;
with the angry k'edness of a demon's spite, while its eyes--&#xD;
-great God !-Its eye-for there was but one, and that one&#xD;
in the very centre of its forehead, between the nose and brow&#xD;
-was bloodshot and purple, gleaming with infernal ligh&#xD;
and it glamored down with more than fiendish malignance&#xD;
upon the woman and the man. . . .   .-Nothing        .t&#xD;
this Thing was clearly cut or defined, except the head-tst&#xD;
hideous, horrible head. Otherwise it was incomplete-a&#xD;

sort of spectral Formlessness. It was unfinished as was th&#xD;
awful crime-thought that brought it into being. It was on&#xD;
one side apparently a male, on the other it looked like a&#xD;
female ; but, taken as a whole, IT. was neither man nor wo-&#xD;
man, IT was neither brute nor human, but IT was a monster&#xD;
and a ghoul-born on earth of human parents. There are&#xD;
many such things stalking our streets, and invisibly presid-&#xD;
mg over festal scenes, in dark cellars, by the lamp, in the&#xD;
cabinet and camp; and many such are daily peering down&#xD;
upon the white paper on the desks where sit grave and solemn&#xD;
Ministers of State, who, for Ambition's sake and greed of gold,&#xD;
play with an Empire's destiny as children do with toys, and&#xD;
who, with the stroke of a pen, consign vast armies to bloody&#xD;
graves-brave men, glorious hosts, kept back while victory&#xD;
is possible-kept back till the foeman has dug their graves&#xD;
just in front of their own stone walls and impenetrable ram-&#xD;
parts-and then sent forward to glut the ground with human&#xD;
blood. Do you hear me, Ministers of State? I mean you !&#xD;
you who practically regard men's lives as boys regard the&#xD;
minnows of a brook. I mean you, who sit in high places,&#xD;
and do murder by the wholesale-you who treat the men as&#xD;
half foes, half friends, tenderly-whose hands are griped with&#xD;
the iron grip of death around the Nation's throat-the Na-&#xD;
tion's throat-do you hear ?-and crushing out the life that&#xD;
God and our fathers gave it. Remember the Irish Brigade !&#xD;
Forget not Fredericksburg ! and bear in mind that this gor-&#xD;
gon of your own creation will not quit you. day or night-&#xD;
not even on your dying day, when it will hiss into your ears,&#xD;
"Father, behold, embrace me !"-and its slime will fall upon&#xD;
and choke you, as you have choked our country ; and the&#xD;
sheeted ghosts of six hundred thousand heroes, slaughtered&#xD;
by a whim, will mournfully upbraid, and-perhaps-forgive&#xD;
you. Will the weeping widows and the countless orphans-&#xD;
pale, blue-cast women, pale with grief, blue with want ; or-&#xD;
phans, poor little shriveled, half-starved orphans-will they&#xD;
forgive you ? will your own conscience ? will the Eternal&#xD;
God of Heaven'? Why did you sacrifice these six hundred&#xD;
thousand men ? Why did you not put your guns and swords&#xD;
m the hands of six hundred thqtisand men-men who had&#xD;
God's best gifts to fight for and maintain-Liberty and their&#xD;
wives ?-Black men too-brawny, brave, strong-hearted,&#xD;
Freedom-nerved, God-inspired  Black  mei.  No  black&#xD;

remove the chains-here in the North ?      Why don't&#xD;
you bid them rise, be men, and then-Victory will perch&#xD;
upon your banners. See ! yonder is a plain, miles in extent.&#xD;
In its center stands a lone and solitary man, and his hands&#xD;
are tied ! His occupation has been that of a Path-Finder ;&#xD;
his name is Fremont, and there is more magnetic power in&#xD;
that single name than in a thousand Ministers of State-&#xD;
and such will be History's record, when she hands you down&#xD;
the ages ! Well, go and cut the cords that bind him, and let&#xD;
him say through the empty air, " Black Man, come with me&#xD;
to Victory ! Let us save the Nation !" and the swift wmds&#xD;
will bear the sound on lightning pinions from pole to pole ;&#xD;
from sea to sea ; and from hovel, hut and palace will come a&#xD;
throng, a fearful host, shouting, "Fremont and Victory !"&#xD;
Over the seas will come troops, and they will fill that empty&#xD;
plain, and before their battle-cry will go down the hearts of&#xD;
those who now laugh at you, Minister of State-laugh at&#xD;
you, and blaspheme God and Human Right ! Think of these&#xD;
things, 0 Ministers. . . .  . And so this fearful specter&#xD;
in Tom Clark's room had its origin then and there-had been&#xD;
created by the morning's wicked thought-a creature fash-&#xD;
ioned by their human wills, and drawing its vitality from their&#xD;
life and pulses-drawing its very soul from out those two&#xD;
beating human hearts. Tell me not that I am painting a&#xD;
picture limning the creature of a distorted fancy. I know&#xD;
better,'you know better, we all know that just such hideous&#xD;
creatures, just such monstrosities move, viewless, daily, up&#xD;
and down the crowded streets of Santa Blarneeo, up and&#xD;
down the streets of the Empire City and Puritanic Boston ;&#xD;
but there are crowds of them in Pennsylvania Avenue, and&#xD;
they wear phantom epaulettes upon their spectral shoulders!-&#xD;
You and I know that just such and other&#xD;
Monstrous, horrid things that creep&#xD;
From out a slimy sea,&#xD;
&#xD;
exist all over the land-but principally in high, places, begot-&#xD;
ten of Treason and lust of Gold. This fact I knew before, for&#xD;
we of the TRINE comprehend these mysteries; but I learned&#xD;
it again, by a process not to be revealed, from the very lips,&#xD;
the fiery lips of the Thing there standing on the floor-there&#xD;
standing and scowling on the sleeping contemplators of&#xD;

into a filmy mist, until at last only the weight of its presence&#xD;
was felt, for it floated invisibly but heavily through the&#xD;
room, and, except the gleam-the fiery gleam of its solitary&#xD;
eye, nothing else of it was discernible. . . . Ten minutes&#xD;
elapsed after it had found voice, and faded away, when sud-&#xD;
denly a fleecy cloud that had for some time past obscured&#xD;
the sky in the direction of Hesper, shutting out. her silvery&#xD;
smiles, broke away, and permitted her beams and those of&#xD;
the moon to once more enter the chamber and flood it with a&#xD;
sheeted silver glory-the room where still lingered the hate-&#xD;
ful thing. and where still slept the woman and the man-the&#xD;
light broke in and flooded the room through the little window&#xD;
at the foot of the bed, whose upper sash was down. Simul-&#xD;
taneous with this auspicious event there came sighing over&#xD;
the landscape, the musical notes of such a song as only&#xD;
seraphs sing--came over the wastes like the mystical bells&#xD;
that I have heard at sunset often while sailing on the Nile-&#xD;
mystical bells which thousands have heard, and marveled&#xD;
at--soft bells, silvery bells, church bells-bells, however, not&#xD;
rung by human hands. I have often heard them chiming&#xD;
over Egypt's yellow, arid sands, and I believe they are rung&#xD;
by angel hands on the other side of Time. And such a&#xD;
sound, only sweeter, came floating o'er the lea, and through&#xD;
the still air into the little chamber. Was it a call to the&#xD;
angels to join in prayer-midnight prayer, for the sinful&#xD;
souls of men ?  But it came. Low it was, and clear; pure&#xD;
it was, and full of saintly pity, like unto the dying cadence&#xD;
of the prayer that was prayed by the Sufferer on the stony&#xD;
heights of Calvary ; that same Calvary where I have stood&#xD;
within a year, 'midst devout lovers of their Lord, and the&#xD;
jeering scoffs of Mussulmans ! And the music came-so&#xD;
sweetly, as if 'twould melt the stony heart of Crime itself.&#xD;
And it proclaimed itself the overture of another act of the&#xD;
eventful drama then and there performing. And see ! look&#xD;
there ! the curtain rises. Woman, Man, behold ! Alas !&#xD;
they slumber insensibly on. Gaze steadily at that upper&#xD;
sash-above it--for it is down; see, the clear space is again&#xD;
obscured by a cloud ; but this time it is one of silver, lined&#xD;
with burnished gold, and flecked and edged with amethyst&#xD;

and opal. Look again ! What is that at the window ? It is&#xD;
T       a visible music-a glorious sheet of silvery vapor, bright,&#xD;
clear, and glittering as an angel's conscience ! It is a broad&#xD;
and glowing mantle of woven gossamer, suffused with rose-&#xD;
blushes, and sprinkled with starbeams ; and it. like the other,&#xD;
flows through the space, and streams into the chamber,&#xD;
bathing all things in holy, tremulous light, soft, sweet,&#xD;
balmy, and pure as the tears of virgin innocence weeping for&#xD;
the early dead ! That light ! It was just such a light as&#xD;
beamed from your eyes, Woman-beamed from out your soul&#xD;
when, after your agony, your eye first fell upon the angel&#xD;
you had borne-the man-child whom God gave to your heart&#xD;
a little while ago ; just such a light as flashed fitfully from&#xD;
your soul, and fell upon the cradle, -0 father, of the strong&#xD;
and hopeful heart, wherein the little stranger lay ; just such&#xD;
light as beamed from your eyes, in pride, and hope, and&#xD;
strange, deep prophecies, as you bent over her languishing&#xD;
form, heartfully pressing her first-born to her dear woman's&#xD;
bosom, when you looked so tenderly, kindly, lovingly down&#xD;
through her eyes, imto her spirit-the true heart beating for&#xD;
you and it, beneath folded-contentedly folded, arms-con--&#xD;
tented, too, through all the deep anguish, such, 0 man, as&#xD;
only a woman and a mother can undergo. That light ! It&#xD;
was like that which fell upon the babe she had given you,&#xD;
and the great Man-wanting world-given first for its com-&#xD;
ing uses, and then to Him, who doeth all things very well-&#xD;
well, even when He taketh the best part of our souls away,&#xD;
and transplants the slips in His eternal and infinite gar-&#xD;
dens, across the deep dark gulfs that hide the dead ; just such&#xD;
a light as gleamed from her eyes and thine own, when your&#xD;
hearts felt calm and trustful once more, after the great, deep&#xD;
grief-billows had rolled 'over them-grief for the loss of&#xD;
one who stayed but a little while on earth-all too coarse&#xD;
and rough for her-some little cooing Winny-like mine-&#xD;
whose soul nestles afar off, on His breast, in the blue sky,&#xD;
and whose body they laid in the cold grave, there in Utica,&#xD;
while I ,was on the deep-winsome Winnie! child of my&#xD;
soul, gone, lost, but not forever !-just such a light played in&#xD;
that little room as stream from angel eyes when God takes&#xD;
back at the hands of Azrael and Sandalphon, the beautiful&#xD;
angels of Death and of Prayer, the things you had learned to&#xD;
love too well-to forgetfulness of God and all true human&#xD;

streamed through and into the chamber where lay the woman&#xD;
and the man ; and it radiated around, and bathed every ob-&#xD;
ject in a crystallic luminescence ; and it carried a sadness&#xD;
with it--just such a sadness as we feel when parting from&#xD;
those who love us very well ; as I felt on the day I parted&#xD;
from my Trinius-Brother of my soul ! when we parted at&#xD;
the proud ship's side-the ocean courser, destined to bear me&#xD;
over the steaming seas to visit Egypt's hoary shrines. It&#xD;
bore a sadness with it, like unto that which welled up from&#xD;
my soul, tapping the fountains of friendship--and tears upon&#xD;
its way, in the memorable hour wherein I left the Golden&#xD;
Gate, and began my perilous journey to the distant Orient-&#xD;
across the bounding seas. What an hour !-that wherein&#xD;
our bodies move away, but leave our sorrowing souls be-&#xD;
hind ! Well, a holy light, sadness-bearing light like this&#xD;
now rested on the bodies of the sleeping pair. At first, this&#xD;
silvery radiance filled the room, and then the fleecy vapor&#xD;
began to condense slowly. Presently it formed into a rich&#xD;
and opalescent cloud-column, which speedily changed into&#xD;
a large globe, winged, radiant and beautiful. Gradually there&#xD;
appeared in the centre of this globe a luminous spot, monien-&#xD;
tarily intensifying its brilliance, until it became like unto a&#xD;
tiny sun, or as the scintilla; of a rare diamond when all the&#xD;
lamps are brightly shining. Slowly, steadily, the change&#xD;
went on in this magic crystal globe, until there appeared&#xD;
within it the diminutive figure of a female, whose outlines&#xD;
became more clear as time passed on, until, at the end of a&#xD;
few minutes, the figure was perfect, and stood fully revealed&#xD;
and complete--about eighteen inches high, and lovely-ah,&#xD;
how lovely !--that figure ; it was more than woman is-was&#xD;
all she may become-petite, but absolutely perfect in form,&#xD;
feature and expression ; and there was a love-glow radiating&#xD;
from her presence sufficiently melting to subdue the heart of&#xD;
Sin itself, though robed in*Nova Zembla's icy shroud. Her&#xD;
eyes !---ah, her eyes !-they were softer than the down upon&#xD;
a ring-dove's breast-not electric, not magnetic-such are&#xD;
human eyes; and she was not of this earth-they were some-&#xD;
thing more, and higher-they were tearful, anxious, solicit-&#xD;
ous, hopeful, tender, beaming with that snowy love which&#xD;
blessed immortals feel. Her hair was loose, and hung in&#xD;
flowing waves adown her pearly neck and shoulders. Such&#xD;

say that they resembled petrified light, tinted with the morn-&#xD;

ished, rainbow hues ; or rather the resplendent tints of polar-&#xD;
ized light. In its center was the insignia of the Supreme Tern&#xD;
pie of the Rosie Cross-a circle inclosing a triangle-a censer&#xD;
on one side, a foul-anchor on the other, the centerpiece being a&#xD;
winged globe, surmounted by the sacred trine, arid based&#xD;

of the Night, garing- down with looks of pity upon the rest-&#xD;
less occupants of that humble couch; for during all these&#xD;
transactions they had been asleep. She stood there, the reali-&#xD;

her, glowered, and floated the eye of that hateful, scowl-&#xD;
ing, frowning Thing-scowling with malignant joy upon the&#xD;

quite as remarkable as either of those already recounted ; for&#xD;
in a very short time after the two Mysteries had assumed&#xD;
their relative positions, there came through the window-&#xD;
the same little window at the foot of the bed-the tall and&#xD;
stately figure of a man-a tall and regal figure. but it was&#xD;
light and airy-buoyant as a summer cloud pillowed on the&#xD;

man of these days, or of this earth, or of the ages now&#xD;

am sent hither to thee, 0, Hesperina, Preserver of the Fall-&#xD;

will of the Omniarch; and, in his name I proclaim that man&#xD;
ever reacheth Ruin or Redemption through himself alone-&#xD;
strengthened by Love of him-self-sought-reacheth either&#xD;
pole of Possibility as he, fairly warned, and therefore fully&#xD;
armed, may elect: Poor, weak man !-a giant, knowing not&#xD;
his own tremendous power !-Master, both of Circumstance&#xD;
and the World-yet the veriest slave to either !-weak, but&#xD;
only through ignorance of himself !-forever and forever fail-&#xD;
ing in life's great race, through slenderness of Purpose !-&#xD;
through Feebleness of Will ! Virtue is not virtue which&#xD;
cones not of Principle within-that comes not of will and&#xD;
aspiration. That abstinence from wrong is not virtue which,&#xD;
results from external pressure-fear of what the speech of&#xD;
people may effect ! It is false-that virtue which, requires&#xD;
bolstering or propping up, and falls when left to try its&#xD;
strength alone ! Vice is not vice, but weakness, that springs&#xD;
not from within-which is the effect of applied force. Real&#xD;
vice is that which leaves sad marks upon the soul's escutch-&#xD;
eon, which the waters of an eternity may not lave away or&#xD;
wash out ; and it comes of settled purpose-from within, and&#xD;
is the thing of Will. The virtue that has never known&#xD;
temptation--and withstood it, counts but little in the great&#xD;
Ledger of the Yet to Be ! True virtue is good resolve, better&#xD;
thinking, and action best of all! That man is but half com-&#xD;
pleted whom the world has wholly made. They are never;&#xD;
truly made who fail to make themselves ! Mankind are not&#xD;
of the kingdom of the Shadow, nor of the glorious realm off&#xD;

Thou art here to save two souls, not from loss, assailings or&#xD;

addressing the Thing, " thou,'grim Shadow-Angel of Crime&#xD;

Begone ! To thy labor, foul Thing, and do thy work also&#xD;

Thus spoke the genius of the Order and the Hour; and&#xD;
then, turning him toward the couch, he said, yearningly,&#xD;
with tearful mien and outstretched arms: "Mortals, hear&#xD;

The citadel is Will. Entrenched within it, thou art safe.&#xD;
But beware of turning thy assaulting power against thyselves.&#xD;
Will, normal, ever produceth Good: Abnormal, it hurls thee&#xD;
to the Bad! Remember ! Wake not to the external life,&#xD;
but in thy slumber seize on the word I whisper in thisN&#xD;

than the seal of Solomon-more powerful than the Chal-&#xD;

and in another instant the tall and stately figure passed&#xD;
through the moonlight out upon the deep bosom of the&#xD;
Night; and he floated, accompanied by the same soft music&#xD;
heard before, away off into the blue empyrean ; and he&#xD;
passed through the window-the little window at the foot of&#xD;
the bed, whose upper sash was down.&#xD;

THE regal being was scarcely gone from the chamber ere&#xD;
Hesperina and the Shadow-which had once more become&#xD;
horribly visible, approached the sleeping pair-drew nigh&#xD;
unto the woman and the man; and the Fay gently breathed&#xD;
upon their heads, as if to establish a magnetic rapport be-&#xD;
tween herself and them. She then calmly took her stand&#xD;
near the bedside, and folded her beautiful arms across her&#xD;
still more beautiful bosom-and awaited the action of the&#xD;
tempter. She had not long to wait, for straightway the&#xD;
black Presence advanced, and hovered over the bed-hovered&#xD;
scowlingly over them, glaring down into their souls, as doth&#xD;

Wrong, peering wishfully at all beautiful things, and true!&#xD;
Such was the posture of affairs ; and thus they remained&#xD;

in Constantinople, I became acquainted with a famous D on-&#xD;

Tom Clark was dreaming. And lo ! great changes had&#xD;
taken place in the fortunes of the sleeping man. No longer&#xD;
a toiler at the anvil or the plow, he, had become a rich and-&#xD;
as times go--therefore an honored man; honored by the&#xD;
crowd, which, as a general thing, sees the most virtue in the&#xD;
heaviest sack of dollars.  ..  .  .  The wealth of Mr.&#xD;
Thomas W. had come to him in a very singular and myste-&#xD;
rious manner, all since he had become a widower-for Mrs.&#xD;
Thomas was dead, poor woman, having some time previously&#xD;
met her fate through a very melancholy accident. An ex-&#xD;
tract from, the 'Daily Truth-Teller," of Santa Blarneeo, a&#xD;
copy of which paper Tom Clark carried in his pocket all the&#xD;
time, and which pocket I shall take the liberty of picking of&#xD;
the journal aforesaid, and of quoting, will tell the story, sad&#xD;
story, but not the whole of it-quite :&#xD;
" FEARFUL AND FATAL CATASTROPHE !-We learn, with&#xD;
deep, sincere, and very profound regret, that another of those&#xD;
fearful calamities, which no human- prudence can guard&#xD;
against, no foresight could prevent-has just occurred, and&#xD;
by means of which a most estimable woman, an exemplary&#xD;
and loving wife, an excellent Christian, firm friend, and&#xD;
esteemed person, has been suddenly cut off in her prime,&#xD;
and sent prematurely to her final account. It appears that&#xD;
the late heavy rains have rendered all the ;roads leading&#xD;
from Santa Blarneeo nearly impassible, by reason of the&#xD;
rifis, rucks, boulders, and slides of clay-very dangerous and&#xD;
gippery clay, which they have occasioned.&#xD;

"Especially is this the case along the cliff road, and ore&#xD;
particularly where it skirts the side of the Bayliss Gul&#xD;
Of late it has been exceedingly unsafe to pass that way in&#xD;
broad daylight, and much more so after dark.&#xD;
"At about ten o'clock yesterday morning, as Ir. Ellet, the&#xD;
Ranchero, was passing that road, along the brink of what&#xD;
known as the Scott ravine, his horse shied at some objects in&#xD;
the path, which proved to be a man's hat and woman'&#xD;
shawl, on the very edge of ine precipice-a clear fall of&#xD;
sonethii like four hundred leet, It immediately occurred&#xD;
to Farmer Ellet, that if anybody had tumbled over the cl i;&#xD;
that there was a great probability that whoever it was must&#xD;
have been considerably hurt-if not more so !-vb thetime&#xD;
they reached the bottom, as he well remembered h   a&#xD;
the case with a yoke of steers of his, that had run off at&#xD;
the same spot some years before, and both of which were&#xD;
killed, very dead indeed, by the accident.. So, at least, he&#xD;
informed. our reporter, who took down the statement phono-&#xD;
graphically. Mr. Ellet discovered the remains ofla horse&#xD;
and buggy at the bottom of the ravine, and at a littemira-&#xD;
left, about ten feet down the bank, where he,had, by a mird&#xD;
cle, been thrown when the horse went over, Mr. Ele  ound&#xD;
the insensible body of a man-desperately hurt, yet still&#xD;
breathing. His fall had been broken by some stout young&#xD;
trees and bushes, amidst the roots of which he now lay. Mr.&#xD;
E. soon rescued the sufferer, who proved to be lr. Thomas&#xD;
W. Clark, a well-known, honest, sober man, and a neighbor&#xD;
as well. Mr. Clark's injuries are altogether internal,tfrom&#xD;
the shock of falling, otherwise he is almost unscratched.&#xD;
His pains inwardly are very great, besides which he is nearly&#xD;
distracted and insane, from the loss of his wife and hore-&#xD;
but mainly for the former. It seems that they had&#xD;
riding out on a visit to a sick friend, and the horse had&#xD;
slipped on the wet clay-had taken fright and leapeded&#xD;
brink, just as Clark sprang from the buggy, and telane&#xD;
where Ellet found him. The horse, carriage, and the pre-&#xD;
cious freight, instantly plunged headlong down through four&#xD;
hundred feet of empty air.  .  .  . . We learn that the&#xD;
couple were most devotedly attached to each other, as is&#xD;
notorious from the fact, among others, that whenever they&#xD;
met, after a day's absence, and no matter where nor in what&#xD;
company, they invariably embraced and kissed each other,&#xD;

*    conjugal love. Poor Clark's loss is irreparable. his wife&#xD;
had been twice married, but her affection for her first husband&#xD;
was but as a shallow brook, compared to the deep, broad&#xD;
ocean of love for him who now mourns, most bitterly&#xD;
mourns her untimely fate !"&#xD;
There ! What d'ye think o' that, my lady ?-what d'ye&#xD;
think o' that, my man ? That's a newspaper report, the&#xD;
same that Tom  Clark carried in his pocket, and read -so&#xD;
often in his dream. Singular, isn't it, that the ruling pas-&#xD;
sion triumphs, especially Reporters'-even in Death or&#xD;
Dream-land ?  After a while Tom  got well, and his first&#xD;
care was to carefully bury what was left of his wife--and her&#xD;
first husband's portrait at the same time-for he had placed&#xD;
that canvass across the backs of two chairs, and amused&#xD;
by himself jumping through it, like a sensible man !&#xD;
There is, do you know it ?-an almost uncontrollable fas-&#xD;
cination in Danger? Have you never been seized with the&#xD;
desire to throw yourself down some yawning chasm, into&#xD;
some abyss, over into the ready jaws of a shark, to handle a&#xD;
tiger, play with a rattlesnake, jump into a foundry furnace,&#xD;
write a book, edit a paper, or some other such equally wise&#xD;
and sensible thing? Well, I know many who have thus&#xD;
been tempted-and to their ruin. Human nature always&#xD;
has a morbid streak, and that is one of them, as is also the&#xD;
horrible attraction to an execution-to visit the scene of a&#xD;
homicide, or a conflagration-especially if a few people have&#xD;
been burnt up-and the more, the stronger the curiosity ;&#xD;
or to look at the spot where a score or two of Pat-landers&#xD;
have been mumified by the weakness of walls-and contrac-&#xD;
tors' consciences. With what strange interest we read how&#xD;
the monarch of some distant lovely isle dined with his cab-&#xD;
inet, offPotage aux tote de missionaire-how they banquetted&#xD;
on delicate slices of boiled evangelist, all of which viandes&#xD;
were unwillingly supplied by the Rev. Jonadab Convert-em-&#xD;
all, who had a call that way to supply the bread of life not&#xD;
slices of cold missionary-and did both ! So with Tom&#xD;
Clark. One would have thought that the last scene he&#xD;
would willingly look upon, would be the bottom of the ra-&#xD;
vine. Not a bit of it. An uncontrollable desire seized him,&#xD;
and for his life he could not keep away from the foot of the&#xD;
cliff. He went there, and day by day searched for every&#xD;
vestige of the poor woman, whose heart, and head likewise,&#xD;

ments. These relics he buried as he found them, yet still&#xD;
could not forsake his daily haunt. Of course, for a time the&#xD;
people observed his action, attributed it to grief and love,&#xD;
forbore to watch or disturb, and finally cared nothing about&#xD;
the matter whatever. Such things are nothing in California.&#xD;
Well was it for Clark that it was so-that they regarded&#xD;
him as mildly insane, and let his vagaries have full swing,&#xD;
for it gave him ample time and opportunity to fully improve&#xD;
one of the most astounding pieces of good luck that ever&#xD;
befell a human being since the year One.&#xD;
It fell out uiion a certain day, that, after attending to other&#xD;
duties, Tom Clark, as usual, wound his way, by a zig-zag&#xD;
and circuitous path, to the foot of the hill, and took his ac-&#xD;
customed seat near by the rock where it was evident Mrs.&#xD;
C. had landed-the precise spot where her flight had been so&#xD;
rudely checked. There he sat for a while, like Volney, in&#xD;
deep speculative revery and meditation-not upon the&#xD;
ruins of Empires, but upon those of his horse, his buggy, and&#xD;
his wife. Suddenly he started to his feet, for a very strange&#xD;
fancy had struck upon his brain. I cannot tell the precise&#xD;
spot of its impingement, but it hit him hard. He acted on&#xD;
the idea instantly, and forthwith resolved to dig up all the&#xD;
soil thereabouts, that had perchance drank a single drop of&#xD;
her blood. It was not conscience that was at work, it was&#xD;
destiny. This soil, that had been imbrued with the blood of&#xD;
the horse and buggy-no, the woman, I mean-he resolved&#xD;
to bury out of sight of man and brute, and sun and moon, and&#xD;
little peeping stars; for an instinct told him that the gore-&#xD;
stained soil could not be an acceptable spectacle to anything on&#xD;
earth, upon the velvet air, or in the blue heaven above it ;&#xD;
and so he scratched up the mould and buried it out of sight,&#xD;
in a rift hard by, between two mighty rocks, that the earth-&#xD;
quake had split asunder a million years before.   _&#xD;
And so he threw it in, and then tried, to screen it from the&#xD;
sun with leaves and grass, great stones and logs of wood,&#xD;
after which he again sat down upon the rock to rest.&#xD;
Presently he arose to go, when, as he did so, a gleam of&#xD;
sunshine flashed back upon his eyes from a minute spicule&#xD;
of, he knew not what. He stooped; picked up the object,&#xD;
and found, to his utter astonishment, that he held in his&#xD;
hand a lump of gold, solid gold-an abraded, glittering lump&#xD;
of actual, shining gold.&#xD;
Tom Clark nearly fainted! The lump weighed not less&#xD;
&#xD;
Z    M&#xD;
C  Ij&#xD;
j&#xD;
at&#xD;
&#xD;
than a pound. I t, sides had been scratched by him as he&#xD;
dug away the earth at the foot of the cliff where his wife&#xD;
had landed, after a brief flight through four hundred feet of&#xD;
empty air-a profitable journey for him-but not for her,&#xD;
nor the horse, nor buggy&#xD;
For a minute Clark stood still, utterly bewildered, and wip-&#xD;
ing the great round beads of sweat from off his brow. He&#xD;
wept at every pore. But it was for a minute only ; in the&#xD;
next he was madly, wildly digging with the trowel he&#xD;
always carried with him, for Tom was herb doctor in general&#xD;
for the region roundabout, and was great at the root and&#xD;
herb business, therefore went prepared to dig them wherever&#xD;
chance disclosed them.&#xD;
Five long hours did he labor like a Hercules, in the soft&#xD;
mould, in the crevices of the rocks-everywhere-and with&#xD;
mad energy, almost frantic zeal. Five long hours did he ply&#xD;
that trowel with all the force that the hope of sudden wealth&#xD;
inspired, and then exhausted, spent, he sank prostrate on the&#xD;
ground, his head resting on a mass of yellow gold- gold not in&#xD;
dust, or flecks, or scales, but in great and massy lumps and&#xD;
wedges, each one large enough for a poor man's making.&#xD;
That morning Thomas Clark's worldly wealth, all told,&#xD;
could have been bought thrice over for any one of the pieces&#xD;
then beneath his head, and there were scores of them. His&#xD;
brain reeled with the tremendous excitement. He had struck&#xD;
the richest "Lead" ever struck by mortal man on the sur-&#xD;
face of the planet, for he had already collected more than he&#xD;
could lift, and he was a very strong and powerful man.&#xD;
There was enough to fill a two-peck measure packed and&#xD;
piled, as close and high as it could be; and yet he had just&#xD;
begun. Ah, Heaven, it was too much !&#xD;
Alas, poor Tom ! poor, doubly poor, with all thy sudden&#xD;
wealth, boundless wealth ! Thou art even poorer than Val-&#xD;
mondi, who, the legends say, gave his soul to the service of&#xD;
the foul fiend ; for he, like thee, had riches inexhaustible,&#xD;
but, unlike Valmondi, and the higher Brethren of the 'Rosie&#xD;
Cross, thou hast not the priceless secret of Perpetual youth.&#xD;
Thou wilt grow old, Tom Clark-grow old. and sick, and&#xD;
gray hairs and wrinkles will overtake thee. And see ! yon-&#xD;
der is .an open grave, and it yearns for thee, Tom Clark, it&#xD;
yearns for thee ! And there's Blood upon thy hands, Tom&#xD;
Clark, red gouts of Blood-and gold cannot wash it off.&#xD;

cased in golden armor, and the shafts of Mercy may not&#xD;

Gold ! Ah, Tom, Ton, thou hadst better have been an hum-&#xD;
ble Rosicrucian--better than 1, for weakness has been mine&#xD;
-been good, Tom, as I want, and hope to be. It is better to&#xD;
labor hard with brain and tongue and hands, for mere food&#xD;
and raiment, than be loaded down with riches, that bear&#xD;
many a man earthward, and fill untimely graves! It is bet-&#xD;
ter to live on bread, and earn it, than to be a millionaire.&#xD;
Better to have heaped up wealth of Goodness, than many&#xD;
bars of Gold. Poor Tom! Rich you are in what self-seek-&#xD;
ing men call wealth ; but poor, ah,, how poor ! in the better&#xD;
having, which whetteth the appetite for knowledge, and its&#xD;
fruitage, Wisdom, and which sendeth man, at night, to Happy&#xD;
Dream land, upon the viewless pinions of sweet and balmy&#xD;
Sleep ! Every dollar above labor brings ten thousand evils&#xD;
in its train. . . .  . Well, night was close at hand, and&#xD;
Tom buried his God, and went home. Home, did I say?&#xD;
Not so. He went to his bed, to sleep, and in that sleep he&#xD;
dreamed that it was raining double eagles, while he held his&#xD;
hat beneath the spout. But he was not home, for home is&#xD;
where the heart is, and we have seen the locality of Clark's.&#xD;
For days, weeks, months, he still worked at&#xD;
his " Lead," studiously keeping his own counsel, and man-&#xD;
aging the affair, from first to last, with the most consum-&#xD;
mate tact ; so that no one even suspected that the richest&#xD;
man in California, and on the entire continent, was Mr.&#xD;
Thomas W. By degrees he conveyed to, and had vast sums&#xD;
coined 'at the mint, as agent for some mining companies. A&#xD;
few hogsheads he buried here and there, and sprinkled some&#xD;
dozens of barrels elsewhere about the ground. This he con-&#xD;
tinued to do until at last even his appetite for gold was&#xD;
doubly, triply glutted ; and then he sprung the secret, sold&#xD;
his claim for three millions, cash in hand, and forthwith&#xD;
1;        moved, and set up an establishment close under Telegraph&#xD;
Hill, in the best locality in all Santa Blarneeo.&#xD;
And now Everybody and his wife bowed to Mr. Thomas&#xD;

many are still bent on worshiping at the self same shrine.&#xD;
That calf has retained to this day "eleven-tenths" of earth's&#xD;
most zealous adoration ! So now did men reverence Clark's&#xD;
money. Women smiled upon him, ambitious spinsters og-&#xD;
gled, and hopeful maidens set their caps to enthrall him. He&#xD;
could carry any election, gave tone to the Money Market,&#xD;
reigned supreme and undisputed king on "'Change," and&#xD;
people took him for a happy man; and so he was, as long&#xD;
as daylight lasted, and he was steadily employed; but,&#xD;
somehow or other, his nights were devilishly unpleasant !&#xD;
le could not rest well, for in the silence of the night, when&#xD;
deep sleep falleth upon man, an unsheeted ghost passed be-&#xD;
fore his face, bearing a most damnably correct similitude to&#xD;
a former female acquaintance of his, now alas, deceased ; and&#xD;
not unfrequently, as he hurried along the streets, did he&#xD;
encounter persons who bore surprising and unmistakable&#xD;
resemblances to the "dear departed."&#xD;
"Black clouds come up, like sinful visions,&#xD;
To distract the souls of solitary men."&#xD;
Was Tom    Clark mistaken?  Was it Fancy?    Was it&#xD;
Fear ?  . . .   . One night he went to a theatre, but left&#xD;
it in a hurry, when the actor, who was playing Macbeth,&#xD;
looked straight into his private box and said :&#xD;
The times have been that, when the brains were out&#xD;
The man would die-and there an end;&#xD;
But now they rise again, with twenty mortal murders&#xD;
On their crowns, to push us from our seats !"&#xD;
And the words pushed Clark out of the house, deadly sick-&#xD;
fearfully pale ; for the avenging furies, roused at last, were&#xD;
at that very moment lashing his guilty soul to madness-and&#xD;
Shakespeare's lines, like double-edged daggers, went plung-&#xD;
ing, cutting, flying, leaping through every vault and cavern&#xD;
of his spirit. He rushed from the place, reached his house,&#xD;
and now: " The bowl, the bowl I Wine, give me wine, ruby&#xD;
wine ." They gave it, and it failed ! Stronger drink, much&#xD;
stronger, now became his refuge, and in stupefying his brain&#xD;
he stultified his conscience. His torture was not to last for-&#xD;
ever, for by dint of debauchery his sensitive soul went to&#xD;
sleep, and the brute man took the ascendent. Conscience&#xD;

slept profoundly. His heart grew case-hardened, cold andT-&#xD;
callous as an iceberg. He married a Voice, and a Figure&#xD;
as heartless as himself ; became a politician -- which.&#xD;
completely finished him-but still, several handsome dona-&#xD;
tions to a fashionable church, just think of it !-had the&#xD;
effect of procuring him the reputation of sanctity, which lie&#xD;
he, by dint of repetition, at last prevailed upon himself to be-&#xD;
lieve. Thus we leave him for a while, and return to the&#xD;
chamber in which was the little window whose upper sash&#xD;
was down.&#xD;
THE DREAM OF BETSEY CLAIRK.&#xD;
Madame, awake, it will be remembered, had come to the&#xD;
conclusion to settle Tom's coffee-and hash, at the same time,&#xD;
with a dose or two of ratsbane, or some similar delicate con-&#xD;
diment; and now, in her dream, she thought all her plans&#xD;
were so well and surely made, as to defy detection, and laugh&#xD;
outright at failure... ...     In California there is a&#xD;
small, but very troublesome rodent, known to Science as&#xD;
"Pseudo-stoma bursarius," and to the vulgar world as&#xD;
pher"-a sort of burrowing rat, nearly as mischievous, and&#xD;
quite as wicked, for the little wretches have a settled and&#xD;
special penchant for boring holes in the ground, particularly&#xD;
mnthe vicinity of fruit trees. My friend, Mr. Rumford, who&#xD;
has a very -fine orchard in Fruit Vale, Contra Costa, just&#xD;
across the Bay from Santa Blarneeo, recently assured me&#xD;
that the rascals make it a point to destroy young trees, not&#xD;
only without compunction, but even without saying, " By&#xD;
your leave." Now, it so happened that Clark's place, like&#xD;
Rumford's, was overstocked with the pestilent animals&#xD;
alluded to, and the proprietors had, time and again, threat-&#xD;
ened the whole race with extermination, by means of arsenic,&#xD;
phosphor paste. or some other effective poison, but had never&#xD;
carried the resolution into practice. This fact was seized on&#xD;
by Mrs. Clark, as a capital point d'appui. Accordingly,&#xD;
with  a dull hand-saw, that lady hacked a few dozen of the&#xD;
very choicest young trees, in such a way as to make it look&#xD;
like unmistakable gopher work, thus subjecting the brutes to&#xD;
charges whereof they were as innocent as two unborn babes.&#xD;
Gophers and the Devil have to answer for a great deal that&#xD;
properly belong to other parties. Her act was a grand&#xD;
stroke of policy. She meant that Tom should voluntarily&#xD;
get the poison, which she intended he-not the gophers-&#xD;
should take at the very earliest possible opportunity. She&#xD;

52             THE ROSICRUCIAN'S STORY.&#xD;
didn't mean to purchase arsenic; oh, no, she knew too much&#xD;
for that! The ravage was speedily discovered by Clark. He&#xD;
raved, stamped his foot in his wrath, turned- round on his&#xD;
heel, pulled his cap over his eyes, ejaculated " Dod dern'em !"&#xD;
started for the city, and that very night returned, bearer of&#xD;
six bits' worth of the strongestgand deadliest kind of poison.-&#xD;
nearly as deadly, almost as strong, as that which stupid fools&#xD;
drink in corner stores at six cents a glass. That night about&#xD;
half the poison was mixed and set. Twelve hours thereafter&#xD;
there was great tribulati a and mourning in Gopherdom;&#xD;
for scores of the little gentry ate of it, liked the flavor, tried&#xD;
a little more-got thirsty-they drank freely (most fools do !).&#xD;
felt uncomfortable, got angry, swelled-with indignation and&#xD;
poisoned meal ! and not a few of them immediately (to quote&#xD;
Mr. Clark) "failed in business ; that is to say, they burst-&#xD;
burst all to thunder !"  Alas, poor rodents! ... . .. Next&#xD;
morning Tom's coffee was particularly good. Betsey fairly&#xD;
outdid herself; in fact she came it rather too'strong. About&#xD;
ten o'clock he felt thirsty, and inclined toward cold water ;&#xD;
for the weather was hot, and so were his "coppers," to quote&#xD;
the Ancient Mariner. He would have taken much water,&#xD;
only that Betsey dissuaded him, and said : "It was just like&#xD;
him, to go and get sick by drinking ever so much cold water !&#xD;
Why didn't he take switchel, or, what was much better'&#xD;
cold coffee with plenty of milk in it-and sugar, of course:"&#xD;
and so he (Tom) tried her prescription, liked it, took a little&#xD;
more, and that night followed the Gophers... . . .  .&#xD;
Three days afterward a kindly neighbor handed Mrs. Clark&#xD;
a freshicopy of the Sahta Blarneo Looking Glass, wherein&#xD;
she read with tearful eyes the following true and veracious&#xD;
account of&#xD;
A MOST DISTRESING AND FATAL SUICIDE!&#xD;
"We regret to announce the fearful suicide, while laboring&#xD;
under a fit of temporary insanity, caused by the bite of a&#xD;
gopher, of Mr. Thomas W. Clark. It appears, that in order&#xD;
to destroy the vermin, he purchased some arsenic, gave some&#xD;
to the animals, got bitten by them, ran stark mad in conse-&#xD;
quence, and then swallowed the balance (about a pound)&#xD;
himself. His unfortunate wife now lies at the point of death,&#xD;
by reason of the dreadful shock. She is utterly distracted&#xD;
by the distressing and heart-rending event, which is all the&#xD;
more poignant from the fact, that inasmuch as probably no&#xD;

married pair that ever lived were more ardently and devot-&#xD;
edly attached than were they. The coroner and a picked&#xD;
jury of twelve men sat for two hours in consultation, after&#xD;
which they found a verdict of Death by his own act, while&#xD;
insane, from the bite of a gopher !"&#xD;
In due time the body of the victim who had been killed&#xD;
dead, so exceedingly dead, by cruel, cold poison-(if it had&#xD;
been warm, he might have stood it, but cold i) -was consigned&#xD;
to the grave-and forgetfulness--at the same time ; and after a&#xD;
brief season of mourning, materially assisted, before company,&#xD;
by a peeled onion (one of the rankest kind) in a handker-&#xD;
chief, applied to the eyes-my Lady Gay, our disconsolate&#xD;
relict-fair, forty, and somewhat fat-gave tokens, by change&#xD;
of dress, that she was once more in the market matrimonial,&#xD;
With her tacks and sheets, and her bowlines, too,&#xD;
And colors flying-red, white, and blue.&#xD;
&#xD;
She was once more ready to dare and do for husband number&#xD;
three. To do her justice she was good-looking-all women&#xD;
are, when they choose to be. Her face was fair and intelli-&#xD;
gent ; she possessed a voluptuous degree of what Monsieur&#xD;
de Fillagre calls " om-bong pong" (enbonpoint), could sing-&#xD;
at a mark ; and if not 0 fat ! was aufait-a little of both,&#xD;
perhaps-on the light, fantastic toe-of the California Order ;&#xD;
while, as an invaluable addition, there was no woman on the&#xD;
coast who could equal her in getting up either linen, a dinner,&#xD;
or a quarrel. She excelled all rivals in the really divine art&#xD;
of cooking a husband-beefsteak, I mean. Her pastry&#xD;
and bread were excellent, her tea was fine, and her&#xD;
4   coffee was all that man could wish-and more so, for it&#xD;
4  was good-perfectly killing-as we have seen. Betsey took&#xD;
matters coolly ; was in no apparent hurry, for she had re-&#xD;
solved to shoot only at high game, and accordingly, after a&#xD;
* time, deigned to smile upon the Reverend Doctor Dryas-&#xD;
dust, the honored head of the new sect recently sprung up&#xD;
in the land, and which was known as the " Watcher Kaw-&#xD;
j  lums." and who rejoiced in repudiating everything over five&#xD;
j years old in the shape of doctrine, tenet and discipline, but&#xD;
who went in strongly for Progress and pantaloons-for&#xD;
women; for Honduras and the naked truth ; for Socialism&#xD;
and -sugar estates; mahogany and horticulture-a patent&#xD;
sort. Now, the pastor of this promising body felt that it was&#xD;
not good for man to b  alone, and therefore cast about for a&#xD;

rib whereof to have fashioned a helpmneet unto him. He saw&#xD;
the widow, fell in love, proposed, was accepted, and in due&#xD;
time she became the wife of the Newlight preacher. I like&#xD;
the old lights best ; she didn't.&#xD;
Betsey achieved a "position"-a thing for which her sex&#xD;
almost proverbially sacrifice all they have on earth-happi-&#xD;
ness, health, long life, usefulness. She enjoyed herself quite&#xD;
well, and only two things disturbed her peace of nind:&#xD;
First, she could not bear the smell or sight of coffee, which&#xD;
drink her new lord was strongly addicted to, and insisted on&#xD;
her making for him with her own hands ; thereby inflicting&#xD;
daily tortures upon her, compared to which all physical pain&#xD;
is pleasure. The second disturbing cause was this: by a&#xD;
very strange fatality their house was overrun with rats, and&#xD;
their garden fairly swarmed with gophers-which, with in-&#xD;
fernal malice and pertinacity, became quite tame and semi-&#xD;
domesticated, and intruded themselves upon her notice a&#xD;
dozen times a day, thereby fetching up from memory's store-&#xD;
house fearful reminiscences of other days-horrible recollec-&#xD;
tions of the gophers of the long- agone. It is .hard to be&#xD;
weaned of your fears ! Nevertheless, after a while she con-&#xD;
quered herself, brazened down her horrors, weighed herself,&#xD;
applied a false logic, tried herself by it, and returned a clear&#xD;
verdict of "Justifiable all the way," and concluded that her&#xD;
present happiness, what there was of it, fairly outweighed&#xD;
the crime by which it had been reached. She vas materi-&#xD;
ally justified in her conclusions by an accidental development&#xD;
of character on the part of her present husband, who had, in&#xD;
a fit of petulance, unfolded a leaf from the inner volume of&#xD;
the soul within.&#xD;
Not caring to recapitulate the whole story (for reticence is&#xD;
sometimes wisdom), I will merely observe that, at the end of&#xD;
a somewhat heated controversy, her-husband had smashed a&#xD;
mirror with one of Webster's quarto dictionaries, and&#xD;
roundly declared that he " preached for pay. Hang it, Ma-&#xD;
dame! the salary's the thing-you Betl! How can souls be&#xD;
saved without a salary ? That's a plain question. They are&#xD;
not now, at all events, whatever may have been the case with&#xD;
the Old Lights, who had a great deal more zeal than discre-&#xD;
tion-more fools they ! It can't be done in these days of&#xD;
high prices and costly raiment-with the obligation of feed-&#xD;
ing well and dressing better. What's life without money '-&#xD;
What's talent without brass ? What's genius without gold'?&#xD;
&#xD;
THE   OSICJUCIAN S STOIn.           55&#xD;
They won't pay ! No, no, Madame ; in the game of life,&#xD;
diamonds are always trumps, and hearts are bound to lose !&#xD;
What's the result?&#xD;
a-Listen ! Five years ago, up in the mountains, I thought I&#xD;
had a call. I did, and went--and preached the new doctrines&#xD;
of Do-as-you-feel-a-mina-to - provided-you-dont-get-catched-&#xD;
at-it-ism--the regular out and out All-Right-ite-provided-&#xD;
you-don't-tread-on-my-corns religion. Well, I preached it,&#xD;
had large houses, converted many--and nearly starved!&#xD;
What's the consequence?  Why, I left, and now hear only&#xD;
the loudest kind of calls ! What's the loudest call ?  Why,&#xD;
the biggest salary ! that's what's the matter ! Do you see&#xD;
the point-the place where the laugh comes in'? It's as&#xD;
plain as A B C to me, or any other mania and all the rest is&#xD;
leather and prunella--stuff, fudge-Hum !"&#xD;
Honest, out spoken Dryasdust ! How many of the world's&#xD;
teachers sail in the same boat ! His eloquence-not all false,&#xD;
perhaps--was not lost upon his wife. The Dryasdusts are&#xD;
not all dead ; there's a few more left of the same sort-only&#xD;
they keep their own counsel, even from their wives. New&#xD;
Lights !&#xD;
As a result of this conversation, Madame became a sort of&#xD;
cross between an Atheist and-God knows what - for she&#xD;
was neither one thing or 'tother, but a sort of pseudo philo-&#xD;
sophical nondescript, without any set principle of belief&#xD;
whatever. H1er conscience froze.&#xD;
" Who knoweth the spirit of a man that it goeth upward,&#xD;
or of a beast that it goeth downward'? The Spiritualists ?---&#xD;
a pack of fanatics ! I don't believe in ghosts"-but she shud-&#xD;
dered as she gave utterance to the words, and her hair crawled&#xD;
upon her head as if touched with spectral fingers. No man&#xD;
disbelieves his immortality- the thing is impossible, per se;&#xD;
for although he may differ with that class of people who pre-&#xD;
tend to very extensive ghostly acquaintanceship and com-&#xD;
mnerce, as many do -yet they doubtless always whistle as&#xD;
they pass a graveyard in the night ! I certainly-do ! Why ?&#xD;
Because I disbelieve in ghosts !-of course.&#xD;
She resumed her soliloquy: " I'm nervous-that's all! I&#xD;
mean to eat, drink and be merry, for to morrow I die - DIE?&#xD;
What of it-isn't Death an eternal sleep ?  My husband&#xD;
says that it is, to all except the New Lights ; but he's a fool&#xD;
in some things, that's certain . . And after death, the Judg-&#xD;
ment !"  And she shuddered again, for a cold wind passed&#xD;

is responsible, not I-a,&#xD;
'In spite of Reason, erring Reason's spite,&#xD;
One truth is clear, Whatever is is Right.'&#xD;
" Tom was to die. The conditions that surrounded him&#xD;
were just such as determined the results that followed. I&#xD;
was but the proxy of eternal Fate. Am I to blame ? Cer-&#xD;
tainly not, for I acted in precise accordance with the con-&#xD;

crime, if crime it be, was a foregone conclusion from the&#xD;
foundation of the world ! Hereafter?&#xD;

And I may take some softer path to glory.'&#xD;
"Parrhassius was a true'philosopher---or Willis. Pshaw !&#xD;

Poor Betsey ! she had been reading Pope and Leibnitz,&#xD;
and Ben Blood-bad, worse and worse, unfairly interpreted;&#xD;
good, better and best, rightly understood - and as the re-&#xD;
spective writers probably meant. Weak people read a book&#xD;
as children do Swift's Gulliver - on the surface ; others&#xD;
reasI the great book whose letters are suns, whose words are&#xD;
statry systems, in the self-same manner ; and there is still a&#xD;
greater volume- the first edition, to be continued-the Hu-&#xD;
man Soul-which they never read at all. All of these must&#xD;
go to school ; they will graduate by-and-by, when Death&#xD;
turns over a new leaf. It is best to study now-there may&#xD;
not be so good a chance presently.&#xD;
Betsey Clark believed, or thought she did, that because&#xD;
God made all things, therefore there could be no wrong in&#xD;
all the world, She accepted Pope's conclusions literally, mis-&#xD;
read them, and totally overlooked the sublime teach-&#xD;

TOM CLARK DREAMS AGAIN.&#xD;
And now the Shadow- the terrible, monstrous Thing, that&#xD;
had so strangely entered the room through the window-- the&#xD;
little window at the foot of the bed, whose upper sash was&#xD;
down -hovered no longer over the heads of the woman and&#xD;
the man - the unhappy woman, the misery-laden man, who,&#xD;
when thelast sun had set, went to bed with Murder and&#xD;
Revenge - and Hatred--this wretched couple, who had con-&#xD;
templated such dreadful crimes, and who, within the past two&#xD;
hours, had had such strange and marvellous dreams ! Only&#xD;
two hours ! and yet in that space had been crowded the events&#xD;
of a lifetime. They say there are no miracles ! What, then,&#xD;
is this ? What are these strange experiences of soul which&#xD;
we are constantly having--fifty years compressed in an hour,&#xD;
of ordinary Dream !--thirty thousand ages in a moment of&#xD;
time, while under the accursed spells of Hashish?&#xD;
The soul flying back over unnumbered centuries ; scanning&#xD;
the totality of the Present, and grasping a myriad Futurities&#xD;
--sweeping the vortex of unborn epochs by the million !-&#xD;
and all in an instant of the clock, while under the influence&#xD;
of the still more accursed Muust.&#xD;
What are the frogs and bloody waves of Egypt, compared&#xD;
to these miracles of the human soul-these Dream lives that&#xD;
are not Dreams?  * * * ** *     And so the Thing took&#xD;
the glare of its horrible Eye from off the woman and off the&#xD;
man.   Its mission-its temptations were over.  And it&#xD;
floated from off the bed, frown-smiling at Hesperina as it did&#xD;
so; and it passed lazily, gloomily, scowlingly through the&#xD;
window at the foot of the bed, through which it had a little&#xD;
previously entered-the little window whose upper sash was&#xD;
down : and it moved through the starlight with a rush and&#xD;
a roar-a sullen rush and roar-as if each star beam stabbed&#xD;
it with a dagger of flame ; and the thing seemed consciously&#xD;
angry, and it sullenly roared, as doth the wintry blast&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ROSICRUCIAN's STORY.              59&#xD;
through the tattered sails of a storm-tosed barque, toil-&#xD;
somely laboring thro' the angry deep : a minute passed, and&#xD;
IT was gone ; thank God ! IT was gone-at last-that&#xD;
horrible Incubus-that most fearful Thing ! Simultaneously&#xD;
the sleepers evinced by their movements that their souls, if&#xD;
not their senses, had been relieved by presence of its ab-&#xD;
sence ; and they were apparently on the point of waking,&#xD;
but were prevented by the magic, or magnetic action of the&#xD;
angelic figure at that moment leaning o'er their couch ; for&#xD;
she gently, soothingly waved her snowy hands, and in a&#xD;
voice sweeter than the tones of love, whispered: "Sleep on;&#xD;
still sleep-softly-sweetly sleep-and dream. Peace, trou-&#xD;
bled hearts ! Peace ; Be still !" and they slumbered on.&#xD;
Tom Clark's dream had changed. All the former troubled&#xD;
and exciting scene had changed-had vanished into thin air,&#xD;
leaving only vague, dim memories behind, to remind his soul&#xD;
of what it had been, and what it had seen and suffered. In&#xD;
the former dream he had been on dry land, solid land ; but&#xD;
now all this was strangely altered, and he found himself&#xD;
tossed on the rough, tumultuous sea ; his lot was cast upon&#xD;
the deep-upon a wild and dreary waste of waters.&#xD;
In his dream the rain-great round and heavy drops of rain&#xD;
-fell in torrents ; the mad winds and driving sleet-for the&#xD;
rain froze as it fell-raved and roared fiercely, fitfully ; and&#xD;
the good ship bent and bellied to the hurricane, and she&#xD;
groaned, as if loth to give up the ghost. And she drove&#xD;
before the blast, and she plunged headlong into the foaming&#xD;
billows, and ever and anon shook her head-brave ship ! as&#xD;
if she knew that ruin was before her, and had determined&#xD;
to meet it as a good ship should-bravely, fairly in the face.&#xD;
I have yet to disbelieve that every perfect work of man-&#xD;
ship, watch, engine-has a semi-conscious life of its own-a&#xD;
life derived from the immortal soul that gave its idea birth-&#xD;
or all these things-these ships, watches, engines, are ideas,&#xD;
spiritual, subtle, invisible, till man hides their nakedness&#xD;
with wood, iron, steel, brass-the fig leaves of the Ideal&#xD;
World. Some people cannot feel an idea, or be introduced&#xD;
to one, unless it be dressed up in matter. Sometimes we&#xD;
lay it on paper or canvas, and draw pencil lines around, or&#xD;
color it, and then it can be seen ; else we take one and plant&#xD;
it out of doors, and then put brick and iron, marble and glass&#xD;
sides to it, rendering the spirit visible, and then thepeople&#xD;
see the Idea's Clothing, and fancy they behold the thing&#xD;

fore the gale, and the masts snapped assunder, like pipe-clay  distinctly showing them the white froth at the foot of the&#xD;
stems, and the billows leaped and dashed angrily at her   cliff-the anger-foam of the demon of the storm. Ali. God !&#xD;

swept them clean, and whirled many a man into the weltering  moves about. Death is standing at the cabin door ; he is&#xD;

Torn Ulark,'1 ai t Brother of the Rosie Cross, and I have&#xD;
been over Egypt, and Syria, and Turkey ; on the borders of&#xD;
the Caspian, and Arabia's shores; over sterile steppes, and&#xD;
weltered through the Desserts-and all in search of the&#xD;
loftier knowledge of the Soul, that can only there be found ;&#xD;
and I found what I sought, Tom Clark-the naturesof the&#xD;
Soul, its destiny, and how it may be trained to any end or&#xD;
purpose. And the History and Mystery of Dream, Tom&#xD;
Clark, from the lips of the Oriental Dwellers in the Temple&#xD;
-and Pul Ali Beg-Tom Clark-our Persian Ramus, and&#xD;
our lordly Chief,-and I learned the worth of Will, and how&#xD;
to say, and mean,-" I will be well, and not sick-alive, and&#xD;
not dead !" and achieve the purpose. How ? That is our&#xD;
secret-the Rosicrucians'-strange order of men; living all&#xD;
along the ages, till they are ready to die-for Death comes&#xD;
only because man will not beat him back. They die through&#xD;
Feebleness of Will. But not so with us, Tom Clark ; we&#xD;
leave not until our work is done, and mine is not yet finished.&#xD;
We exercise our power over others, too, but ever for their&#xD;
good. Well do I remember, how, when I lived in Charles-&#xD;
town, there was an old man dying, but I bade him live. He&#xD;
exists to-day-and long years before that there reached me&#xD;
-lightning borne, on the banks of the Hudson, a message&#xD;
saying, " Come, she is dying !" and I went, and stood beside&#xD;
the bed of the sweet sick child, and I prayed, and I invoked&#xD;
the Adonim of the Upper Temple ; and they came, and bade&#xD;
her live : And she liveth yet, a fair and gentle maiden, and&#xD;
Ah ! how beautiful !-Millie !&#xD;
Till our work is done ! What work? you ask me, and&#xD;
from over the steaming seas I answer, and I tell you through&#xD;
the boundless air that separates us: Our work is to help&#xD;
finish that begun lang syne upon the stony heights of Cal-&#xD;
vary ; in the shade beneath the olive in Gethsemane, where&#xD;
I have stood and wept-begun when Time was two thousand&#xD;
years younger than to-day. Our work, Tom Clark, is to&#xD;
make men, by teaching them to make themselves. We&#xD;
strive to impress a sense upon the world of the priceless&#xD;
value of a MAN!-&#xD;
And the vessel drove before the gale straight upon the&#xD;
cliff. Allhope was at an end; all hope of rescue was dead.&#xD;
There was great sorrowing on board that fated barque.&#xD;
Heads were downcast, hearts beat wildly, ears drank in the&#xD;
mournful monody of the scene, and 1o! the strong man&#xD;
&#xD;
TIHE RoSICRUCIAN's STORY.            63&#xD;
lifted up his voice and wept aloud. Did you ever see a man&#xD;
in tears-tears tapped from his very soul?  God grant you&#xD;
ever may.. The strong man weptI the very man, too,&#xD;
who, a few brief hours before, had heaped up curses, for tri-&#xD;
hing reasons, upon the heads of others; but now, in this&#xD;
hour of agony and mortal terror, he fell upon his knees in&#xD;
the sublime presence of God's insulted majesty ; there.&#xD;
shed to the pump, trembling to his soul's deep center, he&#xD;
cried aloud to Him for-Mercy ! God's ears are never deaf !&#xD;
At that moment one of His Angels-Sandalphon-the&#xD;
Prayer bearer, in passing by that way, chanced to behold&#xD;
thesublime and moving spectacle. And his eyes flashed&#xD;
gladness, even through his seraph tears ; and he could&#xD;
scarcely speak for the deep emotion that stirred his angel&#xD;
heart; but still he pointed with one hand at the prostrate&#xD;
penitent, and with the other he. placed the golden trumpet&#xD;
to his lips, and blew a blast that woke the sleeping echoes&#xD;
throughout the vast Infinitudes; and he cried up, cried up&#xD;
from his very soul: "Behold I he prayeth !" And the Silence&#xD;
of the upper courts of Heaven started into Sound at the glad&#xD;
announcement. There is not only the difference of a species,&#xD;
but of an entire order, between a formal and a soul-sent&#xD;
prayer.  "Behold, he prayeth."   And the sentence was&#xD;
borne afar on the fleecy pinions of the Light, from Ashtoreth&#xD;
to Mazaroth, star echoing to star.... And still the sound&#xD;
sped on, nor ceased its flight until it struck the pearly Gates&#xD;
of Glory-where was an Angel standing-the Recording&#xD;
Angel-writing in a Book ; and 0! how eagerly he penned&#xD;
the sentence, right opposite Tom Clark's name: "Behold!&#xD;
he prayeth !" and the tears-great, hot, scalding tears, such&#xD;
as, at this moment, I am shedding-rolled out from   the&#xD;
angel's eyes, so that he could scarcely-see the book-rmin,-&#xD;
own eyes are very dim-but still he wrote the words. God&#xD;
grant that he may write them opposite your name and&#xD;
mine-opposite everybody's, and everybody's son and daugh-&#xD;
ter--opposite ALL our names ! " Behold, he prayeth." And&#xD;
lo! the Angels and the Cherubim, the Seraphs and the An-&#xD;
tarphim, caught up the sound, and sung through the Dome ;&#xD;
sung it till it was echoed back from Aidenn's golden walls,&#xD;
fi   the East to the West, and the North and South thereof;&#xD;
until it echoed- back in low, melodious cadence froxu the&#xD;
Veiled Throne, on which sitteth in majesty the Adorlai of&#xD;

THE ROsIcRUCIAN's STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
Lord of both the Living and the Dead ! Are there any Dead?&#xD;
No ! except in sin and guiltiness ! ... And there was much&#xD;
joy in the Starry World over one sinner that had in very&#xD;
truth repented.... And still the ship drove on, and on, and&#xD;
on-great heaven ! right on to a shelving ledge of rock,&#xD;
where she was almost instantly dashed into a million frag-&#xD;
ments ; masts, hull, sails, freight, men, all, all swept and&#xD;
whirled with relentless fury into one common gulf of waters ;&#xD;
and yet, despite the din and roar, there rose upon the air,&#xD;
high and clear, and shrill:-&#xD;
"Tintettling shriek, the bubbling cry&#xD;
Of one strong swimmer in his agony."&#xD;
And that swimmer was Tom Clark. Thrice had he been&#xD;
thrown by the surf upon a jutting ledge of rock ; thrice had&#xD;
he, with the strength of despair, clung to the rock, and&#xD;
seized upon the sea-weed growing on its edges, with all the&#xD;
energy of a drowning man. In vain; the relentless sea swept&#xD;
him off again, broke his hold, and whirled him back into the&#xD;
brine. His strength was almost gone ; exhaustion was nigh&#xD;
at hand; and he floated, a helpless, nerveless mass at the&#xD;
mercy of the tide. And yet, so wonderful a thing is a human&#xD;
soul !-in that dreadful moment, when Hope herself was dead,&#xD;
and he was about to quit forever and forever this earth of&#xD;
sin and sorrow, and yet an earth so fair andbright, so lovely&#xD;
and so full of love, teeming so with all that is heroic and&#xD;
true, so friendly! and so kind ; his soul, even then, his pre-&#xD;
cious and immortal soul, just then pluming its wings for a&#xD;
flight to the far-off regions of the Living Dead-that soul&#xD;
for which God Himself had put, forth all His redemptive&#xD;
energy-had abundant time to assert its great prerogative,&#xD;
and bid Death himself a haughty, stern defiance. With the&#xD;
speed of Light his mental vision flashed back along and over&#xD;
the valley of the dead years, and saw arrayed before it all&#xD;
the strange phasmoramas of the foretime. Deeds, Thoughts&#xD;
and Intuitions never die ! They are as immortal as the in-&#xD;
perishable souls that give them life and being! . . . . And&#xD;
Tom Clark was young again; his childhood, youth, maturity ;&#xD;
his sins, sorrows, virtues, and his aspirations, all, all were&#xD;
there, phototyped upon the walls of the mystic lane&#xD;
through which his soul was gazing-a lane not ten inches&#xD;
long, yet stretching away into the immeasurable deeps of&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ROSICRiUcIAN's STORY.             65&#xD;
Infinitude. A  Paradox ! I am speaking of the Soul !-a&#xD;
thing whereof we talk so much, and know so very-little.&#xD;
The specters. of all his Hours were there, painted on the&#xD;
Wall of Memory's curved lane ; his joys, his weary days of&#xD;
grief-few of the first, many of the latter, were there, like&#xD;
green and smiling oases, standing out in quick relief against&#xD;
the desert of his life. His anxious eyes became preternatu-&#xD;
rally acute, and seemed to take cognizance both of fact and&#xD;
cause--:effect and principle at the same glance. His mar-&#xD;
riage life-even to its minutest circumstance-stood revealed&#xD;
before him. He saw Betsey as she had been-a girl, spot-&#xD;
less, artless, intelligent, ambitious ; beheld her married ; then&#xD;
saw her as she was when she joined her lot with his own.&#xD;
He beheld her as she had become-anything but a true wife&#xD;
and woman, for'only her surface had been reached by either&#xD;
husband. There was a fountain they had neither tapped or&#xD;
known. Her heart had been touched, indeed; but her soul,&#xD;
never. He was amazed to find that a woman can give more&#xD;
than a husband is supposed to seek and find. More, did I&#xD;
say ?  My heaven ! not one man in ten thousand can think&#xD;
of a line and plummet long enough to fathom the vast ocean&#xD;
of a woman's affection; cannot imagine the height and&#xD;
depths-the unfathomable riches of 'a woman's Love. Not&#xD;
a peculiar woman's-but any, every woman's love ; your&#xD;
sister's, sir, or your wife's, sir, or mine, or anybody's sister&#xD;
or wife-anybody's daughter. It appeared to Clark's vision&#xD;
that a vast deal of his time had been worse than wasted,&#xD;
else had he devoted a portion of it to the attentive study of&#xD;
the woman whom he had, in the presence of God and man.&#xD;
sworn to love, honor and protect; for no man is fit for&#xD;
Heaven who does not love his wife, and no man can love his&#xD;
wife unless he carefully studies her nature ; and he cannot&#xD;
study her nature unless he renders himself lovable, and thus&#xD;
calls out her love ; and until her love is thus called out, the&#xD;
office of husband is a suicidal sham. Thus saith the canons&#xD;
of the Rosicrucian philosophy. Is it bad?.. .. And he gazed&#xD;
in the depths of her soul, surprised beyond measure to find&#xD;
that God had planted so many goodly flowers in her soul-&#xD;
even in virago Betsey's soul!1 And he said to himself-as&#xD;
many another husband will, before a hundred years roll&#xD;
by-" What a precious fool I've been ! spending all my time&#xD;
in cultivating thistles-getting pricked, and cursing them--&#xD;
when roses smell so very well, and are so easily raised ?&#xD;

fool! I wish"-and he blamed his folly for not having&#xD;
nurtured roses-for not having duly cultivated the rich&#xD;
garden God had entrusted hin with ; execrated himself for&#xD;
not having cherished and nursed this garden, and availed&#xD;
himself of its golden glorious fruitage. It was as a man who&#xD;
had willfully left down the bars for the free entrance of his&#xD;
neighbor's cattle, and then wondering that his harvest of&#xD;
hay was not quite as heavy as desired. .. . Clark saw that it&#xD;
had been in his power-as it unquestionably is in that of&#xD;
every married man-by a few kind acts, a few tender,&#xD;
loving words, to have thawed and melted forever the ice col-&#xD;
lected, by ill-usage-and every woman is ill-used who is not&#xD;
truly, purely, loyally loved ! Ile saw that he might easily&#xD;
have warmed her spirit toward himself, therefore toward the&#xD;
world, and consequently toward the Giver. le might have&#xD;
made their life a constant summer-time--that very life that&#xD;
had been by his own shortsighted externalism, confirmed into&#xD;
a freezing, stormy, chilling winter.&#xD;
Wheat and lentils I have seen in Egypt, taken from a&#xD;
mummy's hand, where they had lain three thousand and four&#xD;
hundred years. Some of that wheat I still possess ; some of&#xD;
it I planted in a flower-pot, and it forthwith sprung up,&#xD;
green and beautiful, into life and excellence. The mummy's&#xD;
hand was dry : the tombs of Beni-lassan were not the places&#xD;
for wheat to grow, for they are very dry. Do you see the&#xD;
point, the place-the thing I'm aiming at ? It is to strike to&#xD;
the earth these brawlers for Divorce-these breakers-up of&#xD;
families, who preach-or prate of-what they have neither&#xD;
brains to comprehend, nor manhood to appreciate-Mar-&#xD;
riage ! . . . . Clark saw, in the s6ul of his wife, in an instant&#xD;
that which takes me an hour to describe ; for the soul sees&#xD;
faster than the hand can indite, or the lips utter. Ie beheld&#xD;
many a gem, pure and translucent as a crystal, shut up in&#xD;
the caverns of her nature; shut up, and barred from the&#xD;
light, all the while yearning for day. What seeds of good,&#xD;
what glorious wheat was there. The milk of human kind-&#xD;
ness had been changed to ice-froth-sour, and sugar-less, not&#xD;
fit to be tasted. Inestimable qualities had been left totally&#xD;
unregarded, until they were covered up, nearly choked out&#xD;
by noxious weeds. God plants excellent gardens, and it is&#xD;
man's express business to keep it and dress it, and just as&#xD;
surely as he neglects it, and leaves the bars down, or the&#xD;

But that he was not kind, tractable, and confiding; and&#xD;
that he was the reverse of all this. Faults of his own-&#xD;
great and many ; self-corrective faults they were. He had&#xD;
been curt, short, sarcastic, selfish, exacting, petulant, offisk,&#xD;
arbitrary, tyrannical, suspicious, peremptory-all of which is&#xD;
contained in the one word MEAN !-andhe was mean. Too&#xD;
late he realized that he might have brought to the surface&#xD;
all the delicious, ripe sweets of her woman, and her human&#xD;
nature, instead of the cruel and the bitter. Ie saw, what&#xD;
every husband ought to see'-but don't-that no woman can&#xD;
be truly known, who is not truly loved !-and that, too, not&#xD;
with mere lip-homage, nor with nervous, muscular, demon-&#xD;
strative, show-love-for no female on the earth but will soon&#xD;
detect all such-and reckon you up accordingly-at your&#xD;

age, right straight from the heart ; from the bottom of the&#xD;
heart-whence springs the rightful homage due from man to&#xD;
woman-right straight from the heart-without deflection.&#xD;
Mind this. Give her that, and ah, then, then, what a heaven&#xD;
J is her presence and then, what a fullness she returns !&#xD;
compound interest, a thousandfold, repeated !-a fullness of&#xD;
affection so great. that God's love only exceedeth it !-a love&#xD;
so rich and vast, that- man's soul can scarce contain the half&#xD;
thereof. This truth I know. This truth I tell, because it is&#xD;
such. You will bless me for it bye-and-bye, when I am&#xD;

Tom Clark was drowning, yet he realized all this. He&#xD;
regretted that he had treated his wife as if she were soul-&#xD;
less, or a softer sort of man. He could have so managed as&#xD;
to have been all the world to Betsey-all the world, and&#xD;
* something more and better, for there are leaves in wedlock's&#xD;

WHAT BECAME OF THOMAS CLARK.&#xD;
OUR entertainer ceased to speak, for the evening meal was&#xD;
nearly ready, and the golden sun was setting in the West,&#xD;
and he rose to his feet to enjoy the glowing scene. Never&#xD;
shall I forget the intense interest taken by those who listened&#xD;
to the tale-and doubtless these pages will fall in the hands&#xD;
.of many who heard i reported from his own lips, on the&#xD;
quarter-deck of the steamer " Uncle Sam," during the voyage&#xD;
begun from San Francisco to Panama, on the twenty-first&#xD;
day of November, 1862. At first his auditors were about ten&#xD;
in number, but when he rose to look at the crimson glories&#xD;
of the sky, fifty people were raptly listening. We adjourned&#xD;
till the next day, when, as agreed upon the night before, we&#xD;
convened, and for some time awaited his appearance. At&#xD;
last he came, looking somewhat ill, for we were crossing the&#xD;
Gulf of California, and Boreas and Neptune had been ele-&#xD;
vating Robert, or, in plainer English, "Kicking up a bob-&#xD;
bery" all night long.   There was at least a thousand&#xD;
passengers aboard the steamer, consisting of all sorts of&#xD;
people-sailors, soldiers, and divers trades and callings, and&#xD;
yet not one of us appreciated the blessing of epigastrial dis-&#xD;
turbances-caused by the " robbery" aforesaid. Many could&#xD;
successfully withstand any amount of qualms of conscience--&#xD;
but those of the stomach are quite a different thing alto-&#xD;
gether; and not a few of us experienced strong yearnings&#xD;
toward New York, and many reachings forth went in that&#xD;
direction. Indeed, the weather was so rough, that scarce one&#xD;
of us in the cabin fully enjoyed our breakfasts. As for me.&#xD;
I'm very fond of mush and molasses ; but I really could i&#xD;
partake thereof on that occasion. No, sir !  The gentleman&#xD;
from Africa, who stands behind our end of the table to min-&#xD;
ister to our gustatory wants, found his office a perfect sine-&#xD;
cure that morning ; and both I and the Rosicrucian, in whose&#xD;

welfare that official took an especial interest-because, in a&#xD;
fit of enthusiasm, we had each given him four bits (ten&#xD;
dimes), seemed to challenge his blandest pity and commiser-&#xD;
ation, for we both sat there, looking as if we had been spe-&#xD;
cially sent for, and couldn't go. The waiter-kind waiter !-&#xD;
discerned, by a wonderful instinct, that we didn't feel exactly&#xD;

as to take a little coffee. Coffee ! Only think of it ! Just&#xD;
after Mrs. Thomas W. had poisoned her husband through&#xD;
that delectable medium. le suggested pork ! Pork, avaunt !&#xD;
We're sea-sick. "Beef !"  Just then I had a splendid proof&#xD;
of Psychological infiltration and transmission of thought ;&#xD;
for my friend and I instantaneously received a strong im-&#xD;
pression-which we directly followed-to arise from   our&#xD;
seats, go on deck, and look over the lee rail. . . . Toward the&#xD;
trysting time, however, the sea smoothed its wrinkles, and&#xD;
the waters smiled again. Presently the expected one came,&#xD;
took his accustomed seat. and began the continuation of his&#xD;
story as follows:&#xD;
THE REST OF ToM CLARK) S DREAM.&#xD;
" ' There's a tide in the affairs of man, which,&#xD;
Taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.'&#xD;
'There's a tide in the affairs of women, which&#xD;
Taken at the flood, leads-God knows where.'-BvRox.&#xD;
Neither do I!  Last night, my friends, we left poor Tom&#xD;
in a desperate situation, from which it seems almost neces-&#xD;
sary that we should relieve him, but really without exactly&#xD;
knowing how-not feeling particularly well from the motion&#xD;
of the ship last night. It is not easy to think, under such&#xD;
circumstances ; still, believing as 1 do, in the sterling motto,&#xD;
Try, why, I will endeavor to gratify your curiosity, especially&#xD;
as I perceive we are honored with the presence of the ladies,&#xD;
and, for their sakes, if not for our own, I feel it incumbent to&#xD;
do something for him. . . . Tom Clark had, by the waves,&#xD;
been already taken in, and by this time was nearly done for,&#xD;
so far as easy breathing was concerned. Slowly, but surely,&#xD;
his vision was fading away, and he felt that he was fast sink-&#xD;
ing into Night.&#xD;
"fDeep the gulf that hides the dead-&#xD;
Long and dark the road they tread."&#xD;
That road he felt that he was rapidly going; for his senses&#xD;

wore becoming numb, and a nauseant sensation proved that&#xD;
if he was not sea-sick, he was remarkably sick of the sea,&#xD;
even to the point of dissolution.&#xD;
All dying persons hear musical sounds: all dying persons&#xD;
see strange, fitful gleams of marvellous light, and so did&#xD;
Thomas Clark-low, sweet music and soft and pearly light&#xD;
it was, but while he drank it in, and under its influ-&#xD;
ence was being reconciled to Death, there suddenly rose high&#xD;
and shrilly above the midnight tempest, a loud and agonizing&#xD;
shriek--the wild, despairing, woful shriek of a woman-and&#xD;
it was more shrill and piercing than the ziraleet of Egyptian&#xD;
dame or Persian houri; and it broke upon the ear of the&#xD;
perishing man, like a summons back to life and hope. Well&#xD;
and instantly did he recognize its tones. " It must be-yet&#xD;
no !-still it can be no other than her v-voice ! It cannot be&#xD;
-and I am dy--ing 1" and an angry wave dashed over him,&#xD;
drowning his utterance, and hurling his body, like a wisp of&#xD;
straw, high upon the ledge of rocks, whence the recoil, or&#xD;
undertow, was about to whirl it out again into the foaming&#xD;
waters, when it was prevented by a most wonderful piece of&#xD;
good fortune, which, at that instant, intervened to save him, at&#xD;
what certainly was the most interesting and critical juncture&#xD;
of his entire earthly existence. Again that sharp voice rang&#xD;
out upon the storm, and a hand, small, soft, yet nerved with&#xD;
all a woman's desperate energy-desperate in Love ! clutched&#xD;
him by the hair, and dragged-triumphantly dragged him to&#xD;
the hard and solid land, just over the ledge, on a winding path&#xD;
at the foot of the overhanging cliff. It was Betsy Clark's&#xD;
voice; it was Betsy Clark's hand ; it was she who. saved&#xD;
him; and thus he received a new lease of life at the hands&#xD;
of the very woman whom, in a former dream, he had sent so&#xD;
gayly sailing down the empty air-down through four hund-&#xD;
red feet of unobstructed space-with boulders at the bottom&#xD;
--solid boulders of ante and quartz-gold-bearing quartz&#xD;
at that, and very rich too, but still quite solid, and consider-&#xD;
ably harder than was agreeable to either the woman, the&#xD;
buggy, or the horse, for not one of them was&#xD;
" Soft as downy pillows are--"&#xD;
Not even Governor Downie'sof California, I mean !&#xD;
It was, indeed, his wife's voice that he heard ; it was she&#xD;
that rescued him from what, in very truth, was a most unfor-&#xD;

tunate pickle-or 1nrine-as you choose, or both-.-but at all&#xD;
events one into which he would never have got had he not&#xD;
been far greener than a cucumber.&#xD;
In a dream strange things come to pass. And in strict&#xD;
accordance with the proprieties of that wierd life and Realm&#xD;
-a life and Realm no less real than wierd-Tom was speedily&#xD;
cared for, and emptied of the overplus of salt he had invol-&#xD;
untarily imbibed, while Mrs. Clark carefully attended upon&#xD;
him, and a score or two of assistant good people busied them-&#xD;
selves in saving all they could from the wreck. After this&#xD;
they all retreated to a fine and comfortable mansion, situated&#xD;
on the summit of this cliff in the regions of Dream, and there&#xD;
the following explanations took place: It appeared that&#xD;
Betsey had been on a visit to her uncle, who kept the light-&#xD;
house, and both of them had for several days been on the&#xD;
look-out for the arrival of the vessel-the wrecked one--iu&#xD;
which, some time previous, Tom had sailed on a voyage to&#xD;
sHoney-Lu-Lu, the Bay of Fun-dee, or some other such place&#xD;
as vessels trade to. The vessel had at last been descried,&#xD;
laboring in the midst of a violent storm, just before dark,&#xD;
Sandunder such circumstances as rendered it positively certain&#xD;
that she would drive headlong upon the rocks at the foot of&#xD;
the very cliff on which the lighthouse stood. By a singular&#xD;
coincidence, perfectly unaccountable anywhere else, save in&#xD;
Dream-land, BetseynClark had' learned to love Tom dearly&#xD;
at the precise instant that he had discovered - and repented&#xD;
his own great error. At the instant that Tom had declared&#xD;
that, could he be spared, he would be a better man, she saw&#xD;
his deadly peril ; the icicles began to melt around her heart,&#xD;
-melt very fast-so that by the time she reached him. her&#xD;
soul was in a glow of pure affection for the man she'had&#xD;
until that moment, hated. She now saw, with unmitigated&#xD;
astonishment, that, with all his faults, there was a mine of&#xD;
excellent goodness; that God had not made anything either&#xD;
perfect or imperfect; and that, after all was said or done,&#xD;
he was of priceless consequence and value to her.&#xD;
Human nature, and woman nature are very remarkable&#xD;
institutions-especially the latter. We seldom value either&#xD;
a man or woman, until they are either dead or a long way&#xD;
off, and then---" Who'd a' thought it1"&#xD;
When Clark awoke from the gentle sleep into which he&#xD;
had fallen after the kind people had made him comfortable&#xD;
when rescued from the danger, he found his head pillowed&#xD;

Years rolled by. Long did they live in the enjoyment of a&#xD;
domestic bliss, too great for expression or description ; a hap-&#xD;

At this point of the story, a lady  Mrs. V., of Bath-in-&#xD;

awhile, and then replied: "It is not right or just, and yet it&#xD;
is very hard to forgive, much less to forget, a cool, deliberate&#xD;
injury, such as I suffered, at the pen, and hand, and tongue&#xD;
of the man alluded to in the introduction of my story. It&#xD;
is hard to forget-" "and still harder to forgive," said one&#xD;
of our company, a rather young looking man, who had been&#xD;

with so much passion. that it was not difficult to see that&#xD;
himself was the one he alluded to in the brief story he&#xD;
straightway told, by way of illustrating his affirmation, Said&#xD;
the stranger, whom I will call " the Angular Character," "It&#xD;
is hard to forgive or forget. Few people in the world are&#xD;
capable of long continued love in a single direction, unless&#xD;
self-trained ; fewer still of deliberate, long continued hatred,&#xD;
and fewer still are competent to full, free, unqualified for-&#xD;
giveness. 1 a  not. In all my experience, I never knew&#xD;
but one man in whom unqualified Hatred was a paramount&#xD;
King-passion, over-riding and surviving all others whatsoever.&#xD;
I will tell you that man's story as he told it'to me, for he&#xD;
was a friend of mine whom I early loved, and who loved&#xD;
me in return. One day I asked him to open his heart to me,&#xD;
which, after a while, he did as follows, saying: 'Listen&#xD;
while I briefly sketch the story of my life. There was a man&#xD;
who, because I differed with him on questions of Philosophy&#xD;
-for he claimed to be God's private secretary, which claim&#xD;
all sensible people laughed at, and only weaklings listened&#xD;
to and believed-he, this man, for this cause, called in ques-&#xD;
tion, not only myself, but the fair fame of the mother who&#xD;
bore me-that mother being already dead ; and for this I&#xD;
hate him, as roses hate the foul malarious swamps of earth.&#xD;
The blazoned motto of that man was-Let no man call God&#xD;
his Father, who calls not man his brother. I rose in the&#xD;
world, and he hated me for the talent God gave me. Envy !&#xD;
I was in a sense his rival, and as such, this man, snake-like,&#xD;
used his very utmost influence ;and power, by tongue and&#xD;
pen, to injure me- and did-for he took the breadsfrom my&#xD;
children by depriving me of employment. I wrote a pamphlet,&#xD;
under a nom de plume, and he joyfully exposed my secret.&#xD;
Jealousy. He attacked me personally, grossly in his paper,&#xD;
misrepresented well known facts--LIED I Robbing me of fair&#xD;
fame, as he had my dead mother before me. It is impossible&#xD;
for A to forgive B for a crime against C. I hated him for the&#xD;
dead one's sake ; that hate I once thought would survive my&#xD;
death, and be the thing next my heart through all the Eter-&#xD;
nities. Perhaps it will not. He crushed me for a time, but&#xD;
'Je renais de mes cendresl' We two are yet in the World.&#xD;
Ile will not forget it! Will I?  Never !-for the sake of&#xD;
my dead mother. I can overlook his crimes toward me,&#xD;

THE ROSIORUQIAN'S STORY.&#xD;
to her-and to my little ones, who nearly starved, while this&#xD;
Bend of hell, in the garb of heaven, triumphed in my misery,&#xD;
and gloated over their wrongs. I am the watchful proxy-.&#xD;
the rightful Nemesis, of the living and the Dead ! I put forth&#xD;
books to the world. This demon in saint's garb, and his&#xD;
minions howled them down as bloodhounds do the panting&#xD;
slave. More bread lost to my hungry ones, more justice&#xD;
calling for reprisals. All men have foes. I had ; and this&#xD;
man-this impostor, this conscienceless outrager of the dead&#xD;
and starver of little children, listened gladly, and covertly&#xD;
published their statements-and that when he morally knew&#xD;
them to be as false as his own black, polygamous, scoundrel&#xD;
heart. More wrong done, more little pale hands reaching&#xD;
vainly forth for bread ; and more hatred laid up for him and&#xD;
his minions at the bottom of my heart of hearts, the core&#xD;
and center of my soul 1"&#xD;
Thus he spake, and the man's eyes flashed fire as the&#xD;
words escaped him, proving that they were not the impulsive&#xD;
utterances of temper, but the deep and cherished results of&#xD;
long and bitter years of feeling. Said I: "And does this&#xD;
feeling demand a physical atonement ?" With a look of&#xD;
ineffable scorn, he replied: "Not for an empire's scepter&#xD;
would I harm a single hair of that man's head. Were his&#xD;
wife in a burning building, I would rescue her, or perish in&#xD;
the trial; were his children-but, thank God, he cannot&#xD;
propagate his species-Monsters never do 1-but had he such,&#xD;
and they were hungry, I would work till I fell from exhaus-&#xD;
tion, in the effort to procure them bread: were the man him-&#xD;
self in want or danger, I would joyously risk my life to save&#xD;
or serve him. Why? Because my revenge is one that eould&#xD;
not be appeased by blood. It is too vast-too deep-and I&#xD;
will wreak it in other worlds, a myriad ages from now. To&#xD;
this I pledge my very soul; and when hereafter I point him&#xD;
to what I am, and what he has brought me to, I will thun-&#xD;

Judge, 'THOU ART THE MAN 1 Wherever he may be, in&#xD;
the Vault, or in the Space, there will I be also. Nor can this&#xD;
feeling die before he shall undo his doing, and---no matter&#xD;
what. At length this feeling of mine grew strong. I loved.&#xD;
It drowned all love. I was ambitious, and ambition paled&#xD;
before it. I had wealth within my reach, and forgot the&#xD;
shining gold in the superior brilliance of the pole star of&#xD;
my passion against the soul of this man, not against his&#xD;

win fame and name:-I, the angular character, will rise, and&#xD;
in my dealings with this fiend will be as remorseless and&#xD;
bitter as the quintessence of Hate; I will suffer patiently,&#xD;
and mount the steeps of fame, and then will I ring the bells&#xD;
at the door of the world till all the peoples wake, and then,&#xD;
then will I launch him down the tide of time in his own true&#xD;
colors-stripped to the center, and show him to the Ages for&#xD;
the monster that he is. This is a revenge worthy of our im-&#xD;
mortal being ; one that merely extends to the physical per-&#xD;
son is such as brutes enjoy, but is not full, broad, deep and&#xD;
enduring enough for a man. As for his minions, they are&#xD;
too contemptible to engage my attention for a moment ; but&#xD;
in their master's soul will I fix my talons so deep, that an&#xD;
eternity shall not witness their extraction; and henceforth&#xD;
I dedicate all my life to the one purpose of avenging the&#xD;
dead !"&#xD;
Five years rolled by after this recital, when again, in a&#xD;
foreign land, we met each other. In the meantime he had&#xD;
}    grown gray. His foe still attacked him; he had never once&#xD;
replied, but his hatred had crystalized in the center of his&#xD;
soul, and, said he, "I can wait a million years; but revenged&#xD;
I will be yet, by the Life of God !' Bitter words were these&#xD;
and they were spoken with such a verve--such a vehemence&#xD;
;    of passion, that not one man or woman on the quarter-deck&#xD;
of that steamer doubted for an instant that himself was the&#xD;
injured one, himself the vehement hater, notwithstanding&#xD;
his implied disclaimer. We saw that he fully, deeply, felt all&#xD;
he gave utterance to ; and never, until that moment, did&#xD;
I comprehend the awful depths and capacity of the human&#xD;
soul for either love or hatred ; nor had any of us, even the&#xD;
Rosicrucian, the faintest idea but that every word of his awful&#xD;
threat came from his heart ; nor the slightest doubt that if&#xD;
there were a possibility of wreaking his revenge in the World&#xD;
to come, that he would find that possibility, and remorse-&#xD;
lessly execute it. I may say, en passant, that two years&#xD;
afterwards I met the same man in a foreign land, and his&#xD;
}   sentiments were precisely as then, only, if possible, far&#xD;
deeper. Said the Rosicrucian, as the man finished his terri-&#xD;
ble recital: " This episode comes in quite apropos to my own&#xD;
story's moral. It is well to beware, lest we, by some act or&#xD;
word of ours, so deeply plant the germ of hatred, that in&#xD;
after years it spring up to annoy us, and mar our peace of&#xD;

firmly'convinced that the man who has just left us' means&#xD;
all that he says ; nor would I incar so dreadful a penalty as&#xD;
that man's hatred, for all the diadems in the terraqucous&#xD;

the offspring of a sense of outraged justice on the part of the&#xD;

his spleen laughs at the man. But Revenge will outlive&#xD;

her happy heart swelling and palpitating with strange emo-&#xD;
tions-she was a budding virgin now, and her heart over-&#xD;
flowed with innocence and love, accompanied with that pure,&#xD;
but strange, wild discontent, and longing for, she knew not&#xD;
what, but something, which all young women feel, and are&#xD;
conscious of, as they pass the golden barrier that divides&#xD;
their youth from womanhood. It is, and was, the holy and&#xD;
chaste desire to love, and be loved in return-from the heart,&#xD;
Sir, right straight from the heart ! Ah, how I sometimes&#xD;
wish I had been created a girl, instead of a-. Bah !&#xD;
What's the use of wishing? especially when all the girls&#xD;
desire an opposite transmigration. . . . Betsey,s bloom out-&#xD;
rivaled the blushes of the newly-wedded roses-roses just&#xD;
married to sunlight, in the morning dew, with all the trees&#xD;
for witnesses, and all the birds to swell the sounding chorus !&#xD;
And she was happy ; ah, how full of happiness ! and yet it&#xD;
was slightly dashed with bitterness-just a twang of gall in&#xD;
her cup of honey-for she imagined a more perfect state, had&#xD;
vague dreamings of something still higher. So have we all.&#xD;
We have it ! and that is a certain sign that that higher some-&#xD;
thing is attainable, if we only try. Some one said he wanted&#xD;
to eat his friend. Good! but I want to lose myself in another&#xD;
self-to make of them twain a unit, which is better!l or to&#xD;
thus blend, and then lose ourself in the great God-life, which&#xD;
is Best! . . . And she gaily tripped over the lea. She was&#xD;
going with a pitcher of cream, and a basket of fresh eggs,&#xD;
toward a hole in the rock, not a great way off, to present&#xD;
them to the strange "Hermit of the Silver Girdle," who&#xD;
dwelt within the little grotto just upon the edge of a forest&#xD;
wild, hard by her girlhood's home.... Now, be it henceforth&#xD;
known to everybody, and to everybody's son or daughter--&#xD;
if the fact is not already patent unto them-that all females&#xD;
between the ages of fifteen and twenty-three, are naturally,&#xD;
spontaneously, and inevitably in love ; and all that is then&#xD;
wanting, is a suitable and worthy object to lavish it upon.&#xD;
If she finds such, well and good; but whether she does, or&#xD;
not, still she must, and will pour it out-either healthily-&#xD;
or otherwise--a cat or a man ; a poodle or politics ; mar-&#xD;
riage, or a mirror. Between those ages the female heart is&#xD;
just as full of love as an egg is full of meat ; nor can she&#xD;
help it; it is the birth of affection, love, romance-the en-&#xD;
deared and endearing spring-tide of life and emotion.- Alas !&#xD;

Presently the girl reached the Hermit's abode, saluted the&#xD;
reverend man, presented her welcome gift, and' received on&#xD;
bended knee his blessing in return.&#xD;
They conversed awhile, did that fair girl and that strange&#xD;
recluse; the hermit stood on this side, the maiden stood on&#xD;
that. "Daughter," said he, as he placed his white palms&#xD;
upon-her beaming forehead, "the world and all it contains&#xD;
amount to but little, if it, and they, be not improved to the&#xD;
utmost-the attainment of 'the soul's aliment, knowledge,&#xD;
which it assimilates and digests into Wisdom. I have par-&#xD;
taken of that food for fourscore years and ten--have con-&#xD;
verted it into wisdom, and expect to be thus engaged during&#xD;
long centuries to come. Thou seest me living here alone,&#xD;
dependent upon the charities of such as thou: poor in Cali-&#xD;
fornia, where even the rocks are retained by golden wedges in&#xD;
their places, and where diamonds sparkle in an hundred&#xD;
valleys. Thou seest me shut out from the busy world, and&#xD;
drawing life from Charity-and Heaven. Such an existence&#xD;
is suitable for me, but not for such as thou art. I am a stu-&#xD;
dent. and professor of a strange and mighty magic, for I pos-&#xD;
sess the marvelous Mirror, and the still more wondrous&#xD;
crystal Globe-both of which are heirlooms of the early&#xD;
foretime, handed down the ages to me, as I in turn shall&#xD;
bequeath them to the ages yet to be. But thou 1 thou'rt a&#xD;
woman, and cannot afford to shut thyself out from life, soci-&#xD;
ety and pleasure, as Rosicrucians do, and must, if they would&#xD;
obtain the kingdom, the Password-that uplifts the sable&#xD;
curtains that hide a dozen worlds-and the Key, by which&#xD;
the Doors of Mystery are opened. Child, for thee there are&#xD;
more fitting things in store than the upper knowing-better&#xD;
than solitude ; higher charms than study, and abstruse pon-&#xD;

And so say ing, the grey hermit of the silver girdle. who&#xD;
dwelt in a forest wilt, led the way to a recess of the grotto.&#xD;
where the light was vet y subdued, very dim, and exceedingll&#xD;
religions. There lhe seated her before a tripod, supporting a&#xD;
triangular shelf or table, himself taking a seat directly oppo-&#xD;
site. Upon this table he then placed a small, square, (lark-&#xD;
leathern box, opening on brass hinges across the sides and top.&#xD;
He oflied it, while reiterating his caution, and disclosed to&#xD;
the enraptured gaze of the doubly-delighted girl-all girls&#xD;

them are considerably delighted-if not more so, to get rid&#xD;
of them afteraarls '--a magnificent globe of pare crystal.&#xD;
clear as a dew-drop, radiant as a sunbeam. It was not over&#xD;
four inches in diameter, was a perfect sphere, and was alto-&#xD;

son, but a just one-for there are few things more beautiful&#xD;
than these self-same soap-bubbles!.... The first impulse of&#xD;
the girl wts to handle this beautiful trine-as it was called;&#xD;
and she made a moyement with that intent, but was instantly&#xD;
prevented by the hermit in gray, who said : c"Not for a hun-&#xD;
dred husbands, should mortal fingers touch that sphere; for&#xD;
such contact would instantly rob it of its virtues, perhaps&#xD;
never to be regained ! Look, my daughter, look, but touch&#xD;
not !" . . . . She obeyed, and withdrew her hand, but re-&#xD;
gretfully ; for her fingers itched severely-as what young&#xD;
woman's would not, under similar circumstances.  Vide the&#xD;
Apple and Eve-by means of which, man fell-but fell up-&#xD;
hill, nevertheless ! A great trait, is this curiosity ; and it is&#xD;
perfectly safe to say, that, leave a box near a woman, and tell&#xD;
~ her not to open it, and ten to one she has fully investigated&#xD;
its contents within an hour ! It is woman's nature ; it is her&#xD;
great prerogative: But for her, man would have been ex-&#xD;
ceedingly diminutive esculents. She looked into matters and&#xD;
things generally, induced him to follow her example, and&#xD;
thus was the main lever that lifted the race out of Barbarism,&#xD;
and into civilization and decency. So much for this much-&#xD;
abused 'Female curiosity."  But for it, man had remained&#xD;
a brute. With it, he has risen to a position a long way be-&#xD;
low the angels, to be sure, but then he is "Coming Up I"&#xD;
The twain now began to gaze steadily at the magic globe,&#xD;
maintaining perfect silence for the space of ten minutes.&#xD;
All was still, hushed, silent as the grave, and only the wild&#xD;
throbbings of the young girl's heart could be heard. Pres-&#xD;
ently the crystal began to change, and to emit faint streams&#xD;
of pale light, which gradually became more pronounced and&#xD;
distinct, until finally there was a most magnificent play of&#xD;
colors all over its surface.  Presently the rich,.effulgent&#xD;
scintillas. the concentric, irridescent flashings previously ob-&#xD;
served. ceased entirely, and in their stead the girl began to&#xD;
notice two very strange and extraordinary appearances,&#xD;
which, to her and to all save those who are familiar with&#xD;
such mysteries (and which, although nearly unknown in this&#xD;
country, are still quite common in the farther East), are to-&#xD;
tally unaccountable. In the first place, she became conscious&#xD;
that she was breathing an atmosphere highly charged with&#xD;
a subtle aura that manifestly emanated from the body of the&#xD;
crystal itself. This air was entirely different front that which&#xD;
floated in the grotto an hour before, when she entered with&#xD;

&#xD;
her offering. The air was.unmistakably charged, and that,&#xD;
too, very heavily, with a powerful magnetic aura, which un-&#xD;
questionably radiated from the exquisitely-polished surface&#xD;
of the crystalline "sphere. I said "magnetic ;" I should have&#xD;
said "magnetoid," for whereas the former induces drowsy&#xD;
feeling and somnolence, the latter had a purely opposite&#xD;
effect, for it provoked wakefulness, and promoted greater and&#xD;
intensified vigilance on the part of both the woman and the&#xD;
man.&#xD;
In the second place, there camera remarkable change in&#xD;
the crystal itself; fbr, having lost its brilliant, diamond-like&#xD;
colors and interchanging rainbow spray, it now became de-&#xD;
cidedly opalescent, speedily passing into the similitude of a&#xD;
ball of clear glass, with a disc of pearly opal transversely&#xD;
through its center. Very soon even this changed, until it&#xD;
became a dead white wall, upon the surface of which the eye&#xD;
rested, without the power of penetration as before. Gazing&#xD;
steadily upon this opaque frame, the girl in a short time dis-&#xD;
tirtly and perfectly beheld, slowly moving across that pearly&#xD;
shield, as if instinct with life, numerous, petite, but unmis-&#xD;
takable human figures I-figures of men and women, tiny to&#xD;
the last degree, but absolutely perfect in outline and move-&#xD;
ment . . . . And they moved hither and thither across the&#xD;
field of vision; she saw them moving through the streets of a&#xD;
city-a little closer ! As I live, they are going up and down&#xD;
Bush street I- an aristocratic thoroughfare in the great city&#xD;
known in this story as Santa Blarneeo. This fact she in-&#xD;
stantly recognized, with that strange and inexplicable an-&#xD;
achronism peculiar to Dreams, and the still stranger incon-&#xD;
sistency peculiar to dreamers and voyagers to the Summer&#xD;
Land-of which latter I have much more to say, in another&#xD;
story, by-and-by-a very curious story-all about riding on&#xD;
electrical rivers, moon beams, horse-flies, and secretary-&#xD;
birds -all very "funny," all very strange-when I tell it,&#xD;
by-and-by. My time has not come ; but it will, for I'm&#xD;
" coming up I"&#xD;
Gradually these tiny figures appeared to enlarge, or rather&#xD;
she saw them in such a perspective, that they looked like&#xD;
full-sized persons some little distance off. Even while she&#xD;
gazed, the crystal changed again, or, rather, vanished from&#xD;
her perceptions altogether, the figures enlarged- approached,&#xD;
as it were-and she became a passive spectator of a scene at&#xD;
that moment transpiring - but where ?   Certainly not in&#xD;

"Where, then," you ask. And I answer, and I tell you,&#xD;
in the identical words of the strange Hermit of the Silver&#xD;
Girdle, when explaining it to Egtsey Clark: All these&#xD;
strange things are occurring, not in any sort of phantom-&#xD;
.world, but in another material earth, quite as solid as this on&#xD;
which we are this hour sailing from San Francisco to Pan-&#xD;
ama. And the crystal of the Hermit in this dream, and the&#xD;
similar crystals of my brother Charles, and my own, and&#xD;
others of our wondrous Brotherhood, serve but as telescopes&#xD;
-magic, it is true, but still as telescopes, revealing to the&#xD;
initiated all the marvels of that other sphere of being whereof&#xD;
1 have hinted, and am now about to briefly speak.&#xD;
Listen ! Space is by no means limitless, but is a globular&#xD;
or elliptical, definite region-the play-ground of the Powers-&#xD;
and is bounded on all sides with a thick amorphous wall, of&#xD;
the materials of which new worlds and starry systems from&#xD;
time to time are fashioned. This wall is thicker, a million-&#xD;
fold, than the diameter of the entire menstruum wherein this&#xD;
universe is floating.. Surrounding this universe, on all sides of&#xD;
this wall, are seven other universes, separated as is this, from&#xD;
all the others ; and they all differ from our own and the rest,&#xD;
as differs a volcano from a sprig of rosemary-that is to say,&#xD;
utterly-totally. The material worlds of each of these other&#xD;
universes outnumber the sands of the desert, yet their num-&#xD;
ber is precisely that of the Realm in which we live; but they&#xD;
are larger, for the earth that corresponds to, and bears the&#xD;
name of this of ours, is, in the smallest of the other universes,&#xD;
quite as bulky as the sun which gives us light-- and the other&#xD;
solar bodies in proportion. The universe next higher is im-&#xD;
measurably larger than the one just alluded to. It has the&#xD;
same number of material worlds, and the earth corresponding&#xD;
to this of ours is as large as the solar system in which we&#xD;

are. That of the third is as large as the solar system of the&#xD;
second, and so on to the last of the series of seven ; but not&#xD;
the last in fact, for outside of, and surrounding the entire&#xD;
seven, is another wall, separating them from forty-nine other&#xD;
systems, in ascending grade. I cannot now give you any in-&#xD;
formation respecting the sublime realities of these forty-nine,&#xD;
nor of the regions and realms STILL BEYOND; for I must&#xD;
have a dispensation from the Grand Master, to enable me to&#xD;
do that-therefore I recall your attention to this world and&#xD;
sphere of being.&#xD;
On earth there are seven distinct classes or orders of men:&#xD;
the INsTINcTUAL, ATFECTIONAL, INTELLECTUAL, INTUITIONAL,&#xD;
ASPIRING, INDI ERENT, and WIsE-to all of whom a differ-&#xD;
ent destiny is    d. Organizations determine destinies!..&#xD;
Every nebulae    in the far-off heaven is a system of worlds.&#xD;
That wonderf         of stars to which our sun belongs, is,&#xD;
with all its  erfl  g measure of star-dust, but a single cos-&#xD;
mos; and there are yiiads of such within the confines of this&#xD;
present universe, d before we cross the vast ocean of&#xD;
Ethylle, an  reach  he Wall alluded to. All things are in&#xD;
halves: male, female negative, positive-light, dark-and so&#xD;
on. So is t  nebulae   worlds to which we belong. Now,&#xD;
remember     at I have s id of the resemblances between this&#xD;
earth and   iverse and the seven others beyond the Wall.&#xD;
Precisely such likenesses exist between the worlds of the&#xD;
respective halves of our own system.......At various dis-&#xD;
tances, flecking the vault, we behold suns and systems innu-&#xD;
merable. These all belong to this, the female half of our&#xD;
system. Beyond them lies a vast ocean of Ether, separating&#xD;
the Continents. Across that Ocean, at % distance incomputa-&#xD;
ble by the human intellect, is the male half of our system.&#xD;
There-there is a sun precisely as large, as brilliant, and as&#xD;
hot as ours-and no more so. Around that sun fiery comets&#xD;
whirl, planets revolve, and meteors flash, just as they do&#xD;
hitherward. There is a Venus, Mercury, Asteroids, Mars,&#xD;
Jupiter, and all the other planetary bodies, just as here, and&#xD;
of the same dimensions. A globe there is called Earth ; it&#xD;
has a moon, an Atlantic, Pacific, Mediterranean, and other&#xD;
seas, exactly equivalent to ours. It has a California, a San&#xD;
Francisco, Paris, Berlin, Munich, Boston, New York, Phila-&#xD;
delphia, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, just as here ; and their names,&#xD;
as are those of its trees, countries, counties, towns, people,&#xD;
capitals, are exactly as on this earth. There is a President&#xD;

they deal the same ponderous blows at Wrong as do their&#xD;
similitudes here. The streets and omnibuses are precisely as&#xD;
here: Wall street is as full of thieves, and contractors get fat&#xD;
off their country's gore as they do here. There is a Rebel-&#xD;
lion there, and Union Generals sell themselves to Treason&#xD;
just as here-while the men who could and would save the&#xD;
nation are left out in the cold, in spite of the Banners of&#xD;
Light, Tribunes, Posts, Times and Heralds of Progress&#xD;
all of which long since pointed out the road to Richmond and&#xD;
to victory-and are laughed at just as in our planet.&#xD;
In that far distant world there is at this moment a&#xD;
steamer, "Uncle Sam," sailing across the Gulf of California&#xD;
as at this moment we are ; and on board of her there are just&#xD;
as many men and women as on this one ; and their persons,&#xD;
names, habits, features, motives, hopes, fears, characters&#xD;
secrets, and intellectual and moral natures, are precisely&#xD;
the same as our own, on board this ship. Our namesakes&#xD;
there are at this instant doing, thinking, acting, reading, as&#xD;
are we ; and sonic of them are listening to a very strange&#xD;
story, and its still stranger episodes, told by a Rosicirucian-&#xD;
just such a mysterious personage as myself-indeed, my Very&#xD;
Self--in the self-same form and feature. And I say, and I&#xD;
tell you that the alte- ego-the living portrait of each man&#xD;
and woman in this circle is thinking of him or herself, and of&#xD;
Me and my revelations, at this moment, with the same stupid&#xD;
levity, with the same deep and awful impression of their&#xD;
truth, in the same manner, whatever it be, as are all of you&#xD;
at this moment. And some there, as here, set me and my&#xD;
revealments at naught-stigmatize me as fool or madman,&#xD;
moon-struck enthusiast, or dreaming poet, as do some of&#xD;
you. Others believe my truths. You have heard that com-&#xD;
mg events cast their shadows before them; and that Proph-&#xD;
ecy has been demonstrated true. Behold the solution of the&#xD;
world-enigma. Events transpire in that other world a trifle&#xD;
sooner than they do here ; yet you must remember that&#xD;
there ,is a vast interval of space, and therefore time, that&#xD;
must be bridged by even that swift courier, Sympathy. Ac-&#xD;

awful gulph, and the one telegraphs the other-often a long&#xD;
time before the event becomes actualized on this earth. You&#xD;
have heard of Fays and Fairies ! Listen, and learn the truth&#xD;
concerning them: Remembering that no human soul can by&#xD;
any possibility quit the confines of this universe, until it has&#xD;
exhausted the whole of its-the universe's resources, and has&#xD;
attained all of Love, Will, Majesty, Power, Wisdom and Dig-&#xD;
nity, that this vast cosmos can give it ; after which, it sleeps&#xD;
awhile, but will awake again to the exercise of Creative&#xD;
Energy, on the thither side of the wall-both duplicates&#xD;
sleep at once-for after their deaths on the material earths,&#xD;
they exist apart, but sustain the same relations, in certain&#xD;
aromal worlds attached to their respective primary homes.&#xD;
At the final deaths, they blend forever, their stature is in-&#xD;
creased, and they enter through the Wall, that earth resem-&#xD;
bling the one whereon the double unit had its birth originally.&#xD;
. .. You have heard of Metempsychosis, Transmigrations, or&#xD;
Reincarnations, and of Progress. Listen, and learn more :&#xD;
Not only the inhabitants of. the countless myriads of worlds&#xD;
in this material and aromal universe, but also the material&#xD;
and aromal worlds themselves, are in a constant state of&#xD;
progressive movement. By aromal worlds, I mean the aerial&#xD;
globes that attend each planet. They are places where souls&#xD;
rest awhile after death, before they commence in earnest the&#xD;
second stage of their career ; and this state is an interme-&#xD;
diate one, just like sleep, only that they are conscious and&#xD;
active while there; but it is an activity and consciousness,&#xD;
not like, but analogous to that of Dream. Every world, and&#xD;
assemblage of worlds, is periodically reduced, by exhaustion,&#xD;
but at enormously long intervals, into Chaos, and is then re-&#xD;
formed, or created anew, still, however, being the same&#xD;
world. After this passage, each system and world becomes&#xD;
vastly more perfect than before ; but, owing to the dimin-&#xD;
ished quantity of Spirit, or essence, which has been con-,&#xD;
sumed in giving birth to hosts of immortal armies, each&#xD;
system and world is vastly smaller than before. This is for&#xD;
two reasons, one of which I have just stated ; the other is,&#xD;
in order to make room for new cosmi, and new worlds, both&#xD;
of which are being constantly created from the material of&#xD;
the wall, and the wall itself is the condensed effluence of the&#xD;
Maker-in short, it is God-Od- and therefore inexhaustible.&#xD;
The majority of those who have lived on any world are re-&#xD;
born in it after its restitution, they in the meantime having&#xD;

grown correspondingly clean and perfect. The same relative&#xD;
proportions between a world and its occupants is still pre-&#xD;
served, and never varies, and consequently the six foot man,&#xD;
and the five foot woman, find themselves, at maturity, occu-&#xD;
pying five, and four foot bodies, respectively. The present is&#xD;
our thirty-four th Incarnation. Originally, we were taller&#xD;
than many of our present trees, and coarser than our moun-&#xD;
tains. We are smaller, and better than ever before; and our&#xD;
worst man is better than the best of the preceding state.&#xD;
The worst. in the next change, will be better than our best.&#xD;
To illustrate, let me say that the following persons, viz.:&#xD;
T- W-, A- L-, Russel L -, Bennett, G-, R-, Cullen&#xD;
B-, Dr. H-, Jeff Davis, James Buchanan, Wigfall, F-,&#xD;
Dr. C-; Secretaries W-     and U-; McC-, L--, C-,&#xD;
} Lizzie D- and myself, respectively, were, previously to the&#xD;
last change: the first, a feudal lord ; the second, an editor ;&#xD;
the third, a Danish prince; the fourth, a court-jester; the&#xD;
fifth, a missionary ; the sixth, a generalissimo; the seventh,&#xD;
a harpist; the eighth, a theatrical manager ; the ninth, a&#xD;
knife-grinder ; the tenth, a privateer ; the eleventh, a dis-&#xD;
tiller; the twelfth, a schoolmaster ; the thirteenth, a trum-&#xD;
peter ; the fourteenth, a politician; the fifteenth, a hunter ;&#xD;
the sixteenth, a very little boy-died, exceedingly young ;&#xD;
the seventeenth, an emperor ; the eighteenth, a born queen;&#xD;
and the last, a barber's clerk ; so that it is evident, that&#xD;
though our progress is slow, still, that we are "Coming&#xD;
up." Little as our actual worth may be, still, we are better&#xD;
now, generally speaking, than in the former stage.* Thus,&#xD;
we will grow smaller at every change. Some worlds, and&#xD;
their people, have thus decreased, and being sometimes seen&#xD;
by people here, have been called fays or fairies. The world&#xD;
has yet to undergo some thousands of these changes, until,&#xD;
at last, we become very small, indeed, which will occur when&#xD;
* Extremes meet, The sublime impinges on the ridiculous. The&#xD;
above-save only that I have changed the names-was put forth&#xD;
seriously as truth, by a recent British author. Here, of course, it&#xD;
is but a "nice bit of Fancy." Viewed in one light, the notion is&#xD;
almost as absurd as are the desperately funny lucubrations of&#xD;
Andrew Jackson Davis, concerning what he calls the "Summer&#xD;
Land," which many people regard as true revelations of Man's&#xD;
Post-mortem life, when, in fact, they are monstrous abortions, de-&#xD;
void of even common sense, and are without one particle of truth&#xD;
from beginning to end, as I intend to prove in a work I am prepar-&#xD;
ing expressly on the subject.-[Tn AUrnon.&#xD;

conception is no longer possible on the earth, either in the&#xD;
vegetable or animal world ; and then will occur the change&#xD;
and transference beyond the Wall. . . . Betsey Clark was&#xD;
beholding persons and events of that other world-half of&#xD;
this, our little staying-houses beholding things through&#xD;
that fairy lense-that beautiful, magic crystal, through which&#xD;
the human eye can see, the human brain, sense, things that&#xD;
have occurred, are occurring, or are to occur, upon the&#xD;
world-stage of this, our life's theater. . . . It is an estab-&#xD;
lished fact that fools never dream! Wise people often do !&#xD;
And those belonging to the latter category cannot have failed&#xD;
to notice that things, dates, persons, circumstances and prob-&#xD;
abilities, are considerably mixed up, as a general thing, in&#xD;
dreams. Their anachronisms are especially remarkable-&#xD;
and provoking, and indicate that time is of but little, if any,&#xD;
account, so far as the soul, per se, is concerned. A dream of&#xD;
a minute often embraces the multifarious experiences of a&#xD;
century. This instant you are hob-nobbing with one&#xD;
of the Pre-Adamite Kings, on the plateaus of Eastern&#xD;
Asia; and. in the next, are taking wine with Pharaoh and&#xD;
Moses, on the banks of the Nile. Now, you are delivering&#xD;
an oration before Alexander the Great ; and, in a jiffy, find&#xD;
yourself stuffing ballots on Cornhill, in an.election for ard-&#xD;
constable. Now, you are contemporary with Sardanap lus,OA&#xD;
or Thothmes III.; and, in half a second, you are delive-ing&#xD;
a " Spiritual Lecture" in Lamartine Hall, having paid fifty&#xD;
cents for the privilege of listening to your own "Splendid&#xD;
and Overpowering Eloquence."   Taken altogether, dreams,&#xD;
like Complimentary Benefits, are queer concerns. Such was&#xD;
that of Betsey Clark; for, at one moment of time, she was&#xD;
a virgin girl, a wife, a widow, and a wife again. She recog-&#xD;
nized, at once, the facts of her girlhood, that she had care-&#xD;
fully deposited one husband in a hole in the ground, and was&#xD;
in high hopes of performing the same kind office for a&#xD;
second-Mr. Thomas W.&#xD;
Presently the view of Santa Blarneo in the crystal,~faded&#xD;
away, and, in its stead, there came the appearance of a large&#xD;
and splendid atelier, containing numberless statues, in a more&#xD;
or less finished condition, standington pedestals, or in niches&#xD;
round the wall-sides. The sculptor was absent. It was evi-&#xD;
dent, at a glance, that his images were not hewn of marble,&#xD;
but of some other material, which needed but a touch of fire&#xD;
to make them start up into life, liberty and light. It was a&#xD;

&#xD;
man-factory-- a place where people were carve! out to order&#xD;
by a wonderful Artist, who had just opened business there-&#xD;
abouts, and who, judging from appearances, was already in a&#xD;
fair line of patronage, and quite likely to do well, if not&#xD;
better. . . . Standing near the center of the apartment,&#xD;
propped up with bits of wood, Betsey saw the exact like-&#xD;
ness, in all respects, of Mr. Thomas Clark-but the figure&#xD;
was unfinished-soft, puttyish, and doughy as a Northern&#xD;
Politician-that is to say, it looked as if it wanted to be&#xD;
carried out and buried, without the benefit of clergy-as all&#xD;
doughfaces ought to be. . . . This statue stood semi-erect,&#xD;
and strongly suggested an invalid kitten, leaning on a hot&#xD;
brick ; or, a modern philosopher of the spread-eagle and Pro-&#xD;
gressive school, when the contributions are small; or, an&#xD;
anxious lover, who would-if he could, but he couldn't-&#xD;
marry a girl and her papa's bank-book in the same ceremony.&#xD;
This figure was labeled, on the breast, " Toni Clark, as he&#xD;
was;" that is to say, soft, ductile, capable of being moulded&#xD;
into the Ruffian or the Man. Directly beside it was another&#xD;
statue, closely resembling the other in many points, but yet&#xD;
different. It was labeled, " Tom Clark, as he is !" that is&#xD;
to say, it looked as if abundantly capable of feeding on ten-&#xD;
penny nails, dining on files, and supping upon pigs of iron. It&#xD;
looked, for all the world, as if the greatest possible favor that&#xD;
could be done for it, would be to tread on the taof its coat,&#xD;
or knock a chip off its shoulder. It-looked as if ifs supreme&#xD;
delight would be to be permitted to wrap itself in a star-&#xD;
spangled banner ; move across the room in three strides and&#xD;
a straddle ; fire off two horse-pistols, and die like a son of&#xD;
a-gun, after .having exercised a special penchant for Di-&#xD;
vorced women-separating two wives from their husbands-&#xD;
the one for the sake of position and wealth, the other for&#xD;
beauty and lust. It looked as if it was troubled about&#xD;
stealing rain-producing theories-not for stealing, but for&#xD;
being caught at it. It looked as if its heart was breaking,&#xD;
because it had not brains enough to be a Pantarch-or the&#xD;
tenth part of one. It looked as if its heart would burst with&#xD;
envy, because other men had friends, and power, and ap-&#xD;
plause, and merit, in spite of its little, peeked-up, seven-by-&#xD;
nine, skull-cracked soul-poor soul-cambric, needle-eyed&#xD;
soul, twelve hundred and eighty trillions to the half ounce.&#xD;
It looked, for all the world,'as Tom really did the very last&#xD;
time he came home, just before they lay down upon their&#xD;

couch, iqi the little chamber in which was the little window,&#xD;
'whose upper sash was down-that is to say, short, crusty,&#xD;
crisp, and meaner than "git," as he felt before they both layn&#xD;
down, and dreamed such " very funny " dreams-Mean,&#xD;
despicable, iron-hearted Tom Clark, the plague of her life,&#xD;
bane of her existence, and source of all her troubles. So at&#xD;
least it seemed to the lady in her curious vision. Presently&#xD;
both these figures slowly faded from her sight, and in their&#xD;
stead there arose through the floor a third figure, labeled,&#xD;
" Tom Clark, as he may be." While she was admiring the&#xD;
vast superiority, in all respects, of this new statue, a fourth&#xD;
human figure.entered the atelier ; this figure was alive, and,&#xD;
mirabile dictu / the woman beheld the exact counterpart&#xD;
of-herself!-clad as a working artist-a sculptor, with&#xD;
apron, paper-cap, and dusty clothing, all complete, as if she&#xD;
had just left chiseling the dead inarble. This lemur of her-&#xD;
self appeared deeply gratified at the appearance of the&#xD;
statue ; for, after surveying it awhile, she proceeded to arm&#xD;
herself with a flame-tipped baton, wherewith she instantly&#xD;
touched the figure in various places, but mainly on the head,&#xD;
and over the region of the heart. The effect of these touches&#xD;
of flame was to make the figure move ; and, in five minutes,&#xD;
the dead mass was warm with life, vitality and genius-for&#xD;
the phantom-artist appeared to endow the figure with a por-&#xD;
tion of her own life ; and, a closer inspection revealed the&#xD;
curious fact that the flame at the end of the staff-which was&#xD;
hollow-was fed from a deep well of subtle, fine and inflam-&#xD;
mable ether in her own heart. The statue lived. It was Tom&#xD;
Clark, and no mistake ; but Heaven ! what a change !-what&#xD;
a difference between the actual and the ideal man! His&#xD;
features fairly blazed with the fires of Genius and Ambition;&#xD;
and they beamed like a sun, with Friendship, Intelligence,&#xD;
Truth and Manhood-they all held high court in his soul,&#xD;
and radiated from his inspired features ; his very presence&#xD;
charged the air with Mind, though his lips spoke never a&#xD;
word; breathed never a syllable. And now Betsey heard&#xD;
her, alter ego, speak ; and it said to the living statue : "Rise,&#xD;
Tom Clark ; rise, and be a Man-be yourself. Rise !" And&#xD;
it rose ; stepped from the pedestal, erected its head-and such&#xD;
a head-while she, the phantom artist, with careful tread,&#xD;
and anxiously holding her nether lip between her teeth,&#xD;
slowly retreated backward from the room, quitting it through&#xD;
the door by which she had entered a little while before. She&#xD;

Scarcely had the two phantoms left thephantom room,&#xD;
than the woman on the stool-the real Betsey Clark - fol-&#xD;
lowed their example with a sudden bound, exclaiming, as&#xD;
she did so, despite the warning of the Hermit of the Silver&#xD;
Girdle (for whom at that moment she didn't care ;-not even&#xD;
a piece of a fig), "My husband ! my husband !" Human na-&#xD;
ture, especially woman nature, couldn't stand the pressure&#xD;
any longer. She felt, and acted as she felt-as every woman&#xD;
has, since the year ONE-and will, until Time and Eternity&#xD;
both grow gray. "My husband /" there spake the woman.&#xD;
Well, let us concede her prerogative ..... .. In an in-&#xD;
stant the Hermit of the Silver Girdle was in a very great&#xD;
and unprecedented fluster.&#xD;
"Silly girl ! didn't I tell you not to speak ? Only look !&#xD;
see how you have gone and done it !-done me !  Oh, dear !&#xD;
if I warn't a Rosicrucian, I'd get excessively angry, Dorg on&#xD;
it, if I wouldn't !" (and in his placidity, he pronounced&#xD;
"dog" with an r. Commend me to a female for upsetting&#xD;
the best calculation of the wisest Rosicrucian that ever lived.&#xD;
I speak from experience !) "I told you not to open your lips,&#xD;
and here you've gone and spoke right out ! What's the con-&#xD;
sequence," exclaimed the venerable gray-beard. " Why the&#xD;
spell is broken-the charm fled-nor can either be recalled&#xD;
before the sun has set and again declined toward the western&#xD;
sea.. Familiar as I am with the secrets of Gale and the&#xD;
mysteries of magic crystals, I know that you have done very&#xD;
wrong; for no one is fit to consult Destiny by their aid who&#xD;

Now hie thee homeward. To-morrow thou mayest return&#xD;
again, provided thou wilt obey nie, and speak not a syllable&#xD;
while the phantasmal game of Fate is being played before&#xD;

The Hermit of the Silver Girdle had spoken truly; for at&#xD;
the very first movement of her lips, the whole scene of en.&#xD;
chantment vanished into thin air, leaving only a three-cor-&#xD;
nered table and a little glossy-looking ball behind.&#xD;
To depict her chagrin and disappointment at this abrupt&#xD;
termination of a very strange affair, is a task totally beyond my&#xD;
capacities. She bounced out of the grotto in a miff, tossing&#xD;

growling because they have not got somebody else's wife or&#xD;
husband, when the fact is that their own partners are quite&#xD;
good enough-as they would find out with a little trying.&#xD;
Men expect a woman's love to bubble up all the time. Fools !&#xD;
why don't they sound its depth, and bring it to the surface?&#xD;
There are altogether too many divorces-a divorce first, and&#xD;
the next step is-dangerous. I knew a wife of three divorces ;&#xD;
I knew a man the husband of two consecutive divorces.&#xD;
Good intentions ! Bah ! Hell is paved with such. I know&#xD;
a broken-hearted woman whose husband, after wearing her&#xD;
out, sneaked off to Indiana and robbed her of her name.&#xD;
God's Secretary ?-the devil's ! Out upon the wretches !&#xD;
The woman who has wasted her -youth and bloom upon a&#xD;
man who then wants a divorce, and who permits him to ob-&#xD;
tain itis a fool. He promised for life. Make him keep it.&#xD;
even if you invoke the law's strong arm. If both agree, that&#xD;
alter's the case. I have a legal acquaintance in New York&#xD;
who drives a large trade in the divorce line, at twenty-five&#xD;
dollars a head. I feel called upon to expose the infernal&#xD;
methods by means of which it is done, and I call upon our&#xD;
Legislature to see to it that the thing is not suffered to go&#xD;
on. A. is a lawyer : B. and C. are husband and wife. B.&#xD;
wants a ".divorce without publicity ;" goes to A. and pays a&#xD;
fee to secure it, but has no legal quibble by means of which&#xD;
to obtain it. A. gives him the following counsel: " Go to a&#xD;
brothel, take up with an inmate thereof ; call her D.; make&#xD;
three or four male and female acquaintances (E., F., G. and H.),&#xD;
introduce them to D. as your wife ; leave town a day or two,&#xD;
but take care that D. is well watched in the interim. Of&#xD;
course she will avail herself of your absence to ply her voca-&#xD;
tion. E., F., G. and H. furnish the most incontestible and&#xD;
damning proof of her supposed guilt. The witnesses may or&#xD;
may not know your precious scheme. You prosecute the&#xD;
leman under your wife's name-she, of course, knowing no-&#xD;
thing about the proceedings-poor thing ! The court takes&#xD;
the evidence, hands it over to a referee, who passes on it ;&#xD;
returns it, affirmed, to the court, which forthwith enters a&#xD;
decree of perpetual divorce. A scoundrel goes unwhipped of&#xD;
justice, and an honest woman's reputation is forever damned !&#xD;
Legislators, I tell you that these things are done every&#xD;
day, I was told it-could not believe it-and assuming to be&#xD;
desirous of such a decree, received the above counsel, word&#xD;
for word, from a practitioner at the New York bar. Legis-&#xD;

lators, here is a crime worse than murder ! Will you sanc-&#xD;
tion it longer?  How prevent it?  Summon the witnesses&#xD;
and performer of this marriage ; or at least prove the iden-&#xD;
tity of the woman or the man, as the case may be-for women&#xD;
practice in that court also !&#xD;
There would be far less of this sort of iniquity, if there&#xD;
were fewer blatant philosophy-mongers afloat on the tide of&#xD;
the times, inculcating morbid theories, and directly pander-&#xD;
ing to the worst vice a man can have-Meanness.&#xD;
" People insanely look for and expect perfection in ethers-&#xD;
not only without the slightest claim thereto themselves, but&#xD;
without the least attempt in that direction-which is a very&#xD;
suicidal policy to pursue. Such soon come to be vampires,&#xD;
4 co isuming themselves and destroying others-ravening tigers&#xD;
at their own fold's side ! Sometimes one person's affection-&#xD;
which is akin to love--goes out toward and clings round an-&#xD;
other; but Death ever flaps his wings by the side of such,&#xD;
when that other fails to give it back.. The unloving loved&#xD;
one, if such a thing be possible, is a born thief, from the&#xD;
cradle to the clouds; and, my child, there are a great many&#xD;
such robbers in the world."&#xD;
"But, Father, how is one to love, when one don't feel like&#xD;
it, or has.attractions in another direction ?"&#xD;
" Where duty and honor point, there should the attraction&#xD;
lie ! Whosoever shall render themselves loveable and lovely,&#xD;
can no more help being loved than smoke can help ascending&#xD;
through the air. Make yourself agreeable to the partner of&#xD;
your lot in life, and that partner can no more help loving you&#xD;
than mirrors can help reflecting. Now let us attend to the&#xD;
figure before us.&#xD;
"The heart of yonder figure," said the old man-pointing&#xD;
to the. first figure of the previous day, which had, together&#xD;
with the second, re-appeared upon the scene during his elo-&#xD;
quent plea for the perpetuity of wedlock-"is only half full&#xD;
(this first figure of your future husband, only half full) by&#xD;
reason of your withholding and refusing all tender wifeli-&#xD;

wretched, and be the same yourself-cheat your -bodies of&#xD;
health, your souls of happiness and vigor ! Take heed ; cor-&#xD;
rect the fault. You 'can't 1' There's no such word. TRY !"&#xD;
Turning now to the second figure of the previous day, he&#xD;
observed: "See ! Tom Clark's, heart is empty. All its=cells&#xD;

are jAlled with a void-hollow as the apples of Persia's arid&#xD;
wastes. Have mercy, Heaven, on him whose heart throbs&#xD;
not with the rapturous burthen of a woman's love ! Pity&#xD;
him whose soul groweth not tender with the lovelight beam-&#xD;
ing from a baby's eyes ! Ah, what a world of nameless glory&#xD;
flashes from an infant's eyes ! They are telescopes through&#xD;
which my soul sees Heaven-through Which I watch the&#xD;
mazy dance of starry worlds, and behold the joys of sera.&#xD;
phim. We Rosicrucians love babies-- seed of the ages'- and&#xD;
their mothers, too-because they are such; for we believe&#xD;
that after death the maids fare worst--the wives fare better;&#xD;
but no tongue or pen can express the rapture that awaits&#xD;
those who have borne sons and daughters to the world and&#xD;
heaven ! Bachelors ! Bah ! I will pass by such cattle, merely&#xD;
remarking that their place is not to be found in heaven, or&#xD;
the other place. They repair in a body to Fiddler's Green-&#xD;
and ought to stay there, if they do not !"&#xD;
And Betsey gazed on the forlorn figure of poor TomAwho&#xD;
was all one-sided, crooked, lean ; his hopes and joys were&#xD;
flown, because no one loved him, not even his wife ; and who&#xD;
else should, if not she ?  And so he was wretched, like full&#xD;
many another whom I have seen as I journeyed down life's&#xD;
glades. His soul was driven back upon, and forced to eat&#xD;
itself, day by day, and year after year. "And this great&#xD;
wrong, you will do," said the hermit; and "This great&#xD;
wrong, I have already done," thought .the girl-wife--&#xD;
widow-wife-four in one, with that stragge, anomalous&#xD;
inconsistency, peculiar to Dream-Lif6.-- "Ihave done badly ;&#xD;
but this, I will do no more-not an6thersecond longer !"&#xD;
Bravely, royally, thought and said ! Better, if more glo-&#xD;
riouly done !-and that's just the difference-saying and&#xD;
doing. The first is common ; the last is very rare. "Better.&#xD;
still, if truly said, and still more nobly done ."-was whis-&#xD;
pered in the woman's ear. in the same low, silvery voice,&#xD;
she had heard the day before. Who was it that spoke these&#xD;
melodious words?  Not the hermit in gray. Was it the in-&#xD;
visible Hesperina, telegraphing Betsey's soul across the vast&#xD;
expanse of the Continent of Dream? Who shall answer me&#xD;
these questions ?&#xD;
Said the silver-girdled hermit, as he smiled a smile of more&#xD;
than human gladness-more than human meaning-" It is&#xD;
Well." She looked again toward the magic globe, and lo !&#xD;
within a moment, its disc had changed. The first two figures&#xD;
&#xD;
Ile&#xD;
&#xD;
had disappeared ; the third had come upon the scene-a con-&#xD;
spicuous actor in such a terrific drama, as neither earth nor&#xD;
starry eyes ever saw before, may they never see again. The&#xD;
Gorgon, WAR, had'glutted himself on Europe's bloody fields,&#xD;
and had flown across the salt sea, alighting on our shores.&#xD;
The demon landed with a howl, midway between Moultrie&#xD;
and Sumpter. He had seized the reins of government, pro-&#xD;
claimed himself sole Lord and King ; strangled Reason in&#xD;
his dreadful gripe, until she lay bleeding on the gory earth,&#xD;
and meek-eyed Peace fled tearfully away from his grim&#xD;
presence, and hid herself upon a distant mountain-top, whence&#xD;
she could survey the shock of armies on the plains beneath,&#xD;
and sigh, and long for Liberty, and rule. War and Carnage,&#xD;
side by side, with gory banners flying, marched from one end&#xD;
of the nation to the other, until their footsteps rested on the&#xD;
graves of eight hundred thousand men. God's precious word&#xD;
was disregarded, and His blessed soil dyed red with human&#xD;
blood-the rich, fat, blood of the noblest race that ever trod-&#xD;
His earth-the blood of your brother, and of mine,. O,_my&#xD;
countrymen !   . . . And now, the loud-lunged trumpets&#xD;
brayed their fierce-alarums, and summoned Columbia's sons&#xD;
to deeds, at which our grandsons shall turn pale -deeds of&#xD;
heroic daring, such, Greece, nor Rome, nor Carthage, never&#xD;
dreamed of, nor storied page has chronicled: summoned them&#xD;
to Sumpter's stony ramparts, and Potomac's grassy banks--&#xD;
summoned them to do, and - die. Eight hundred thousand&#xD;
Men! And they went-going, as tornadoes go-to strike&#xD;
for a Nation's life-to strike the foul usurper low, and fling&#xD;
his carcase to the dogs. They would have struck-struck,&#xD;
hard and home ; but they were stayed. That was not the&#xD;
"little game," of Generals, and Statesmen, and of high&#xD;
contract-ing parties. 0, no ! Victory would never do ! " Let&#xD;
us fight the foe with gloves on !" said the Minister. They&#xD;
fought.  The foe wore gloves, also; but the palms were&#xD;
brass, the fingers iron, and the knuckles were polished steel!&#xD;
But the Minister had his whim, and unborn generations will&#xD;
feel its consequences ! Eight hundred thousand graves ! And&#xD;
the Union legions went, from decreed Fate toward a consum-&#xD;
mated Destiny, in spite of Ministers, their minions, or the&#xD;
"little game ;" and Tom Clark went, too.... And loud the&#xD;
trumpets brayed ; and the heavy drums did sound ; and they&#xD;
woke strange and fearful energies in the slumbering Nation's&#xD;
heart. What a magic transmutation I Plowmen transformed&#xD;

&#xD;
to-heroes, such as shall forever put Cincinnatus in the shade ;&#xD;
day-laborers, carriers of the hod, claiming-and rightfully,&#xD;
too--high places in the Pantheon of heroic demi-gods. Look&#xD;
at Fredeieksburgh ! Forget not the Irish Brigade ! Bear&#xD;
in mind the deeds of an hundred regiments on an hundred&#xD;
fields--fields, too, that might, and would have finally decided&#xD;
the carnage and the quarrel, but for the Minister, his gloves,&#xD;
his "little game," his great whim--and 1o ! its conse-&#xD;
quences!. . . . Tom Clark, quickened into life by the subtle,&#xD;
flame.tipped staff in the hands of the phantom-artiste-the&#xD;
propriettess of the wonderful atelier and Man-factory, now&#xD;
stepped forth through the door of the room, and forthwith&#xD;
tse scene expanded to such vast' dimensions, that Betsey&#xD;
found it impossible to realize the magic mimicry, for the&#xD;
whole thing was too real, and on too vast a scale. She stood&#xD;
on the hill of the world, surveying its valleys at leisure.&#xD;
Tom Clark, apparently heard--deeply heard, his Country's&#xD;
wail of a^ ny--for unchecked Treason was then griping her&#xD;
tightly    the throat. That cry called him to a field of&#xD;
glory, sue as God's green earth never before afforded, nor&#xD;
is sun ever saw; nor His moon ; nor His myriad, twink-&#xD;
ling, starry eyes! . . .  Clark's soul was in arms, as his&#xD;
o'ended ears drank in the hoarse, deep thunders of Trea.&#xD;
sons cannonry, pouring iron hail upon a prostrate Nation's&#xD;
head; and his eyes beheld the flashing of the guns, as they&#xD;
voimited a hell of iron rain upon Sumpter upon Anderson, and&#xD;
the peerless EIGHTY THREE ! Tom Clak saw the storm,&#xD;
and his heart indignant swelled, at the insult to the Star-&#xD;
gemmed Flag of Human Rights, and Liberty--an insult, long&#xD;
since wiped out in traitor's blood, but for the Minister, and&#xD;
the gloves, and the y"Little game," and the whim, whose&#xD;
consequences are-eig ht hundred thousand skeletons!&#xD;
Like a true man, Clark, inspired by a true woman--the&#xD;
phantonrwife, and artiste, ran, leapt --flew to arms and&#xD;
deathlessglory. Ah, God ! to arms, and fadeless glory ! He&#xD;
bad no time to grieve, or grumble ; or to criticise this gene-&#xD;
i, or that battle. He looked over the heads of cowards and&#xD;
tiftys.ish his own camp, at the noble men in arms, and who&#xD;
blavel. fought, and nobly died, for the Country. He saw,&#xD;
i  loiously -emulated such men as Lyon, Saxton, Hunter,&#xD;
ta-and Baker ! Baker ! 0, Oregon ! my tears fall&#xD;
W 1thine, for him!i  He was mine, yours--ours I Ours, in&#xD;
hi' life ; in his nobleness ; in his soul-arousing eloquence ;&#xD;

in the valor, and the effulgent glory of his death-the result&#xD;
of another whim, and 1o ! the consequences!&#xD;
. . .."And now, seeI Behold the smoke of yonder battle !&#xD;
Death rides on cannon-balls to day ! And, to-night, th"&#xD;
will be much mourning in the land ; for strong men are giv-&#xD;
ing up the ghost. Weep not, 0, widow, for God accepts&#xD;
such sacrifices ; mourn not, 0, orphans, $e who tempers the&#xD;
wind to the shorn lamb, will hold thee in His keeping; thy&#xD;
grateful country will not let thee want for bread ; and, bye-&#xD;
and-bye, it will be a proud boast of thine, "My father die,&#xD;
to redeem the land from treason I" . . . . Death rides ,in&#xD;
cannon-balls, to-day, in the fight that we are seeing. TTum&#xD;
Clark is a hero. See! he leads the van. God spare him!&#xD;
What a presence ! What blows he deals for Liberty, and the&#xD;
Union ! Lo ! the thundering battalions of the brave and&#xD;
bold, but insane, misguided, and revengeful foe, sweep down&#xD;
the embattled plain, their war-cry ringing out apive thre&#xD;
belching roar of artillery ; and with such might-and valor do&#xD;
they charge, that Freedom's cohorts real and stagger with&#xD;
the dreadful shock of arms. Another such a charge, and all&#xD;
is lost. But, see, there comes a man from the ranks-=a comn-&#xD;
mon soldier: his voice rings clearly out upon the silphur-&#xD;
laden air: "Follow me !"  The inspiring words and action&#xD;
kindles new fire in the wavering breasts of hundreds. They&#xD;
rise; they throw themselves upon the foe--they hush his&#xD;
battle-cry in death. He is repulsed I " Who did this ?" de-&#xD;
mands an aid-de-camp. "Private Thomas W.," is the re-&#xD;
sponse. " Hero ! greet him in my name, as Color-sergeant,"&#xD;
says the General; and Tom Clark is promoted on the filled.&#xD;
The first day's fight is over. It is renewed next day, and,&#xD;
when the tired guns give over with the sun, a group "of&#xD;
soldiers are'gathered round a man. " Who 'is it Y.Whois&#xD;
it?" I thought you knew-why, it is the man who saved&#xD;
the tenth Brigade-and was rewarded on the spot--Captai&#xD;
Thomas W.! With the sunrise, came the foe. "Pass the&#xD;
word along the line there--Captain Clark is wanted at the&#xD;
tent of the General-in-Command!" He goes.&#xD;
"Captain Clark, do you see yonder battery of the enemy&#xD;
It must be taken, or we are lost. If I give-yor command of&#xD;
a regiment whose colonel was killed yesterday, can. pou&#xD;
take it ?"  "I will try."  *  *  * "General, the "batteryn&#xD;
the left is ours," says an aid-de-camp an hour -afterwardQ.&#xD;
"It is taken, and all its men are either dead or .prisonersV'&#xD;

1o            'I'HE RosIcRtUcIAN's STORY.'"&#xD;
"Indeed ! So soon'? Greet the commander in my name, and&#xD;
salute him as Colonel Thomas W."  Another day dawns on&#xD;
the ensanguined field-a field where privates were heroes&#xD;
and generals poltroons ! Hard fighting is before us. Up:&#xD;
up the soldiers spring ; and on, on to death or victory they&#xD;
rush.   Oh, it was a splendid sight-those death-defying&#xD;
demi-gods, who, had they in previous battles had but a Man&#xD;
to lead them, would have taken fifty rebel strongholds in as&#xD;
many hours. But such was not the drift of the "pretty little&#xD;
game."  More men must die, more ditches must be dug, and&#xD;
more human bones must fill them, else how can ministers&#xD;
carry out their whims ; how else can the enemy be fought and&#xD;
placated at the same time? It isi't Constitutional ! besides&#xD;
which it hurts a prospect for the Presidency of the re-United&#xD;
States-which prospect would be forever marred, and the " lit-&#xD;
tle game" played out, if we fought without gloves, and vio-&#xD;
lated our Constitutional obligations byekicking the wind out&#xD;
of the foe, who is trying might and main to strangle the&#xD;
Nation.&#xD;
He might hereafter say : "You, sir, fought without gloves&#xD;
on !" which wouldn't do, you know. " Damn that Colonel&#xD;
Thomas W. If the fellow keeps on at that rate, we'll surely&#xD;
whi somebody- badly. Curse the fellow, he don't believe&#xD;
in the glove business, or in the ' Erring Sister's' theory."&#xD;
Soliloquized somebody on a certain day : " This'll never do!&#xD;
Aid, come here; go tell Colonel Clark to take possession of&#xD;
the'valley down yonder, and hold it at all hazards till night-&#xD;
fall? 1" "But, General, he has only seven hundred men-the&#xD;
foe is thirteen thousand strong'1"  " So much the worse for&#xD;
-" he meant Clark, but said, "the enemy--they will fight&#xD;
like tigers."  And the aid transmitted the order-shaking&#xD;
hands with the Colonel as he rode away, muttering, "Poor&#xD;
fellow ! His goose is cooked, for a certainty ! What a pity&#xD;
he stands in somebody's light-somebody who is jealous of&#xD;
even a private's fame. Ah me !" and he rode back to head-&#xD;
quarters, wondering whose turn next it would be to face the&#xD;
forlorn hope - such a singular number of which this Rebel-&#xD;
lion has developed.&#xD;
Ilut there was no flinch in Colonel Thomas W. - no&#xD;
flinch in his men. They all saw the hazard; but they were&#xD;
men and soldiers. They knew how to obey orders, when&#xD;
their superiors did not. But then again, they had no&#xD;

&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BOSIcRUcIAN'S STOR~Y.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
hopes of success in a general election ; they had no "little&#xD;
game.&#xD;
"Their's not to reason why,&#xD;
Their's but to do or die."&#xD;
And they done it !&#xD;
On on, like more than Spartan heroes on they; dashed&#xD;
literally, as absolutely as anything earthly can be, "into&#xD;
the jaws of death-into the mouth of hell." I have a&#xD;
minnie bullet on my table that plowed a furrow through&#xD;
a brother's heart of mine in that same dreadful valley !&#xD;
Away they went-that gallant band, that gallant man ; and&#xD;
many a bullet went crashing through skulls and bones as&#xD;
they went ; and many a soul sped .its way to God ere the&#xD;
cohort reached the knoll in the valley. Once there, they&#xD;
were no longer men -they were as sublime exemplar gods.&#xD;
But a man fell-fell before the resistless force of an hundred&#xD;
horses charging with all of Treason's vehement strength,&#xD;
and the gallant man went down, and the thunder of iron&#xD;
hoofs exploded in his ear, and then the cloud passed on... .&#xD;
And Thomas Clark went down--down, as Truth, and Justice&#xD;
and I went down ; but he rose again--so ever does Truth and&#xD;
Justice; and as for me, Te renais de mes cendres and&#xD;
Resurgam--let those beware by whom I fell. . . . Down to&#xD;
the gory soil he went ; but even while the woman sat there&#xD;
in the grotto, gazing till her eyeballs fairly ached with&#xD;
intensity---sat gazing with suppressed breath, so still was&#xD;
she--sat gazing, her blood on fire, her pulse beating three&#xD;
hundred to the minute, beating with a deep, fierce, tumultu-&#xD;
ous fire ;-sat gazing stilly, while her heart bounded and&#xD;
thumped within its bony citadel as if impatient of its duress,&#xD;
and longing to burst its tabernacle, and let the imprisoned&#xD;
soul go free ; -sat gazing, while her eyes, large gray eyes,&#xD;
all the while gleamed with a light that proved her capable of&#xD;
giving birth to heroes ;-even while thus she sate, I say sate,&#xD;
gazing on the wheeling squadrons, the ,charging hosts, and&#xD;
the great guns, as they gave forth their fiery vomit, charged&#xD;
with sudden deaths-the man, Tom Clark, sprung to his feet&#xD;
again, and, as he staunched .his blood with one hand, he&#xD;
pointed with the other at the foe. "Follow me !" he cried.&#xD;
"See ! we are reinforced ! On to victory- on !" And his&#xD;
voice rose above the tempest, and it flew over the spaces, and&#xD;
it fell upon the-ears of a great man, and the great manuwrung&#xD;

his hands, and he thought: " ot dead yet! Damn. the&#xD;
fellow ! He will make us win a\victory-and that'll never&#xD;
do ! Dear me ! that cursed fool ill spoil my little game !&#xD;
0, fbr night, or a fresh division of-the enemy ! I must&#xD;
reinforce him, though, else it'll get in that infernal Tribune-&#xD;
and that'll spoil my little game ! Ho, there ! Aid- go tell&#xD;
C general Trueman to reinforce Colonel Thomas W. My little&#xD;
game ." and he arranged his epaulettes and gave his mous-&#xD;
tache an additional killing twist. In the meantime, Tom&#xD;
Clark had charged the enemy with bayonets with the&#xD;
remnant of his own force, followed by hundreds whom his&#xD;
example had transformed into something more sublime than&#xD;
fighting soldiers.&#xD;
And now occurred one of those conflicts which make or&#xD;
mar the fortunes of a nation: one of those terrible multi-&#xD;
personal combats which mark a century's history, and strike&#xD;
the ages dumb with awe ; one of those terrific scenes in the&#xD;
world's great drama, that mark historic epochs, and enshrine&#xD;
men's names in fiery letters upon the scrolls of Fame.&#xD;
The charge and the action were short, swift, desperate ;&#xD;
but at its close the&#xD;
Flag of the Planet gems,&#xD;
With saphire-circled diadems,&#xD;
floated proudly over the scene of Treason's battle lost--a&#xD;
Nation's battle won !&#xD;
Day closes again; and the wounded hero in an ambulance&#xD;
was borne fainting--almost dying from the field. "Colonel&#xD;
Clark, can I do anything for you ?" said one of the fighting&#xD;
generals to the stricken man-a bullet had gone through&#xD;
him. "1You are a noble fellow, and I s4k for myself&#xD;
Your comrades in arms, and for our country. Cotn I-can&#xD;
they, can we, can she--do anything for you, in this sad hour&#xD;
of your destiny ? If so, I beg you to speak."  " Ala-s! no,&#xD;
my friend," replied he, reviving, only to swoon again. A&#xD;
little cold water on his temples partially dissipated the coma,&#xD;
but not all the fog from his perceptions; for his general's&#xD;
words, "Can e," considerably obfuscated his intellect, and&#xD;
he thought: "He means Betsey-that's the only she I know&#xD;
of." And then he strengthened up for a last dying effort ;&#xD;
strove to collect his thoughts, partly succeeded, and said:&#xD;
"Nothing more, dear general. Yes. No. I'm-dy-ing&#xD;
&#xD;
THE RosICUcisC 4N'S O4R.         105&#xD;
-going-home. Tell Betsey-dear Betsey-I did not-find&#xD;
her out till-it was-too-late. Tell her that I loved-hier&#xD;
from my-soul--at last. Tell her-that--"&#xD;
"She can't stand the pressure any longer-Globe or&#xD;
no globe, hermit or no hermit-not another minute,. you&#xD;
Bet ! It's a pretty how de do, me a settin here and poor&#xD;
Tom laying there killed a'most to death !" shrieked the fair&#xD;
girl in the grotto of the hermit of the silver girdle, waked up&#xD;
beyond endurance by the skillful magic of the wierd recluse.&#xD;
And repeating the Californian "You Bet /" with vehement&#xD;
emphasis on the last word, she sprung to her feet, in spite of&#xD;
the warnings of the Himwho dealt in magic crystal globes in&#xD;
the precincts of a forest wild-upsetting table, tripod, stool&#xD;
and hermit, in her eagerness to reach Tom's side and&#xD;
give him wifely ministry..&#xD;
What luck she might have had in bridging Phantom&#xD;
River, I know not, having omitted to remain long enough for&#xD;
inquiry, not having had time to thus devote; but this I do&#xD;
know, namely, that she nearly kicked the veritable Mr.&#xD;
Thomas W. Clark completely out of bed-the bed at whose&#xD;
foot was a window, whose upper sash was down-the identi-&#xD;
cal window through which came all the "funny things " of&#xD;
this most veracious history-which, of course, is all: true.&#xD;
Betsey woke from excitement, Tom from being kicked, and&#xD;
both had finished their double dreams.&#xD;
" What'n thunder's up now, Bet-no, Lizzie, I mean ?"&#xD;
said he, checking the less respectful utterance, and modulat-&#xD;
ing his voice to what he doubtless intended to be a "velvet-&#xD;
dulcet cadence," but which wouldn't pass for that in Italian&#xD;
opera.  "Not nothing, Tommy dear."     " Not nothing,&#xD;
Lizzie 7"  "Not nothing."  "That ain't grammar sweet."&#xD;
" I was paragorically speaking, my turk'le dove ! only I've&#xD;
been having two very funny dreams."    "YOU !    Two&#xD;
dreams ?  That is queer !' "You Bet !' "What about,&#xD;
Lizzie ?" " Oh, all about how we didn't love each other as&#xD;
we ought to, husband." "And, dorg on my buttons, wife, a&#xD;
I havn't had two just such dreams myself-all about if&#xD;
precipice and a pile--0, wasn't it a pile,,though ?' "You&#xD;
Bet !  "And my dreams were all about how I ought to&#xD;
love you- and didn t -and then again I did." " That's a&#xD;
dear 1" " You Bet !" " Let's love each other this time&#xD;
out, will you ?"  "I will, will you ? ' " You Bet I"  "Let's&#xD;
profit by our dreams ; I mean to, wont you ?"  "I'll try I"&#xD;
