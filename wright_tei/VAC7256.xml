ENTRIED, according to Act of Congress, In the year 1866, by&#xD;
L. M. OSBORN,&#xD;
in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New-York.&#xD;
I thIlr'  fc  fth    ititcuto'&#xD;
&#xD;
NEW emotions filled the bosom of young Wink-&#xD;
field. Like a high-spirited chicken at the com-&#xD;
pletion of the hatching process, he felt an impa-&#xD;
tient desire to burst out upon and astonish the&#xD;
world. So he put himself on a train of the rail-&#xD;
road which connected his native village in Massa-&#xD;
chusetts with foreign countries. The sense of&#xD;
bereavement at the death, a year before, of his&#xD;
grandmother, his sole relative with the excep-&#xD;
tion of an uncle, nature had wisely supplanted&#xD;
with unusual thoughts of activity; and his pro-&#xD;
found abstractions upon the science of human&#xD;
nature would now acquire the little requisite,&#xD;
which they only lacked to make them   of im-&#xD;
mense value,- the substitution of real men and&#xD;
things for those of the imagination. We here&#xD;
take occasion to hope that no author's weakness&#xD;
for fine writing or sensational effect, no attempt&#xD;
at engaging the critical world, however pardona-&#xD;
ble, will swerve us from faithfully following him&#xD;
in his varied attrition with human and other ani-&#xD;
mals. We shall feel amply repaid if we secure&#xD;
for him the appreciation of the discerning, and&#xD;
we think he will be found-though somewhat ec-&#xD;
centric in his sentiments and singular in his per-&#xD;
son-to be of the stuff heroes are made of, a&#xD;
great deal less foolish than Thaddeus of War.&#xD;
saw, and a great deal more conscientious than&#xD;
the pious Eneas.&#xD;
Mr. Winkfield took the usual naps, refresh-&#xD;
ments, and observations, on the day's travel to-&#xD;
ward New-York. Alive to any illustrations of&#xD;
the principles of his favorite study-the philoso.&#xD;
phy of human nature-he noted many little inci-&#xD;
dents, and one which occurred toward the com-&#xD;
pletion of his journey, we give here. At South-&#xD;
Dibbletown station, in Connecticut, a little man&#xD;
entered the car, looking about him with such a&#xD;
complacent air, that it seemed, if he was not of'&#xD;
any importance there, or anywhere else, he at least&#xD;
had the satisfaction of feeling so. In fact, this&#xD;
little man was starting out from Dibbletown ready&#xD;
to do heroic any thing--any thing which would fur-&#xD;
ther increase the admiration of his fellow-Dibble-&#xD;
towners. So, as the train approached the suburbs&#xD;
&#xD;
of New-York, being led to mistake the character of&#xD;
a person who entered the car and took the seat be-&#xD;
side him-a clergyman of that class who appear&#xD;
able to bear much more on their minds than on&#xD;
their stomachs-and taking him for one of those&#xD;
impostors or confidence men so frequently heard&#xD;
of and talked about by the quid nuns of his na-&#xD;
tive town, he undertook to arrest him, thus to&#xD;
furnish " matter of talk " to them, like Alcibiades&#xD;
to the Athenians.&#xD;
Moses overheard a part of the conversation&#xD;
which ensued between these two worthies. The&#xD;
clergyman was about commencing it, as lie&#xD;
seated himself, when the little man at once start-&#xD;
ed off in a diverting voluntary upon the various&#xD;
subjects of the weather, his own circumstances&#xD;
and intentions, the beauty and grandeur of his&#xD;
native village, and the exemplary virtues of his&#xD;
various relatives and ancestors to the twenty-&#xD;
fifth remove. The clergyman paid attention to&#xD;
all this, but when the little man had exhausted&#xD;
himself, briefly replied that a man, no matter how&#xD;
agreeably surrounded, "had better pay his debts&#xD;
if he wished to be honored in society !" The lit-&#xD;
tle man was about to seek an explanation of this&#xD;
singular remark, when the clergyman went on to&#xD;
classify the manifold debts and duties of each&#xD;
and every dweller upon the footstool, to wit, as&#xD;
a being, as a human being, as a member of so-&#xD;
ciety, of a profession, as a husband, as a father,&#xD;
etc., anI, finally, as "a sheep."&#xD;
"As a what ?" ejaculated the little man.&#xD;
"In using that term, I wished to designate one&#xD;
as a member of a fold, of some religious flock,&#xD;
my friend," replied the other solemnly. Here&#xD;
he revealed his profession, and stated his implicit&#xD;
confidence in the.right to ask for any thing, of&#xD;
any body, anywhere, for its sake.&#xD;
"Undoubtedly a fanatic !" thought the little&#xD;
man.&#xD;
"And you, of course, have heard of our great&#xD;
Simms Memorial project ?" inquired the clergy-&#xD;
man earnestly.&#xD;
" What ? No, sir, I have not," answered the&#xD;
little man,&#xD;
The clergyman stated it. It certainly seemed&#xD;
a beneficial charity, the proposed erection of a&#xD;
new church in the suburbs of New-York ; and&#xD;
with enthusiasm glittering in his eye, he gave a&#xD;
pleasing poignance to his remarks by stating that&#xD;

generous purpose in defending society, and th(&#xD;
promptness of decision which you have--"&#xD;
Hooray I Dry up !" interrupted the crowd&#xD;
promptly putting a stop to Moses's remarks, an&#xD;
at once squeezing in facetious concert, both him&#xD;
and the little man, very severely. In sympathetic&#xD;
alarm the two were ready to swear eternal friend&#xD;
ship, and did succeed in exchanging addresses&#xD;
Moses being adopted as a corroborative witness in&#xD;
the absence of the German gentleman, who had&#xD;
run away with lightning speed at the inception&#xD;
of the difficulty, under the influence of European&#xD;
ideas of American manners.&#xD;
", He's not an impostor. I know him !" here&#xD;
cried a gentleman in the crowd with an embossed&#xD;
nose, who had caught sight of the clergyman.&#xD;
"It's the Rev. Adrunse Botts. My cousin, Jim&#xD;
Sampson, had a wife or two buried from his&#xD;
church in Carminy Street, and I see him there on&#xD;
them occasions"1               ,I&#xD;
" Eh, not ar impostor! Ha,.ha!I That is pretty&#xD;
good " said thestrugglinglittle man, with the air of&#xD;
a man astonished at such a thing being doubted,&#xD;
but for a moment thereafter he certainly appeared&#xD;
to be laboring under that impression himself.&#xD;
" Here comes the poltis," roared several voices.&#xD;
At this announcement, the little man started.&#xD;
"By the way, my valise," said he, with a suddenly&#xD;
hurried air. "You just tell the policeman I've&#xD;
stepped for my carpet-bag," continued he to&#xD;
Moses.&#xD;
" Certainly," said the amiable Moses.&#xD;
In the seething of the crowd he disappeared to&#xD;
seek for the carpet-bag. - The policemen arrived&#xD;
and shook the clergyman by the collar.&#xD;
"I've been robbed !" feebly cried the latter,&#xD;
feeling alarmedly for his certificates.&#xD;
"He has been accused of being a confidence&#xD;
man, policeman I" said Moses, feeling a pity for&#xD;
the prostrate gentleman, "and some unnecessary&#xD;
force, perhaps, was-"&#xD;
"Who accused him, you ?" asked the police-&#xD;
man shortly.&#xD;
S   'Ohl no, a friend-that is, a gentleman,&#xD;
who-".&#xD;
"Itan't no such thing.  It is pickpockets,&#xD;
policeman," interrupted the sympathizer with the&#xD;
embossed no*e, looking sinisterly at MoseS.&#xD;
"They've been robbing of him, and trying' to&#xD;
cover it up by beatin' of him, and sayin' he is a&#xD;
confidence-man."&#xD;
A renewed commotion here appeared in the&#xD;
mob. It dissolved and re-formed like a small&#xD;
chaos agitated by a new principle. It had dis-&#xD;
covered-the absence of the little man, and by one&#xD;
of its mysterious instincts felt he did not intend&#xD;
coming back again.&#xD;
'There was a couple, and this is one of the&#xD;
two," suggested the owner of the nose.&#xD;
"If yez count the little chap as one, this one&#xD;
is twohout .of the three, byjabers !" exclaimed&#xD;
an Irishman, who had been struck with Moses's&#xD;
noble length of limb.&#xD;
"I didn't.  I am not," exclaimed Moses in&#xD;
impulsive indignation.:&#xD;
" Hum. A pal, is he ? Where's t'other ?"'&#xD;
asked thme policeman. .&#xD;
" Cut his lucky, policeman. This one handed&#xD;
him a card, and told him to run for it. We see&#xD;
&#xD;
him. Take them air saddle-bags off your nose.&#xD;
e How air you, four eyes? Hooray, long-legs !"&#xD;
r roared various individuals.&#xD;
e   Notwithstanding his astonishment, Moses cast&#xD;
a look of dignity and scorn upon the crowd at&#xD;
these feeble witticisms. But this lent the latter&#xD;
d what pnt they had, and seemed to be consider-&#xD;
ed by the crowd themselves a much better joke&#xD;
c than any they could make, for their laughter be-&#xD;
- came much louder at it.&#xD;
"Very well. A case of counter-charge. I&#xD;
can't tell which it is, 'specially this one," said&#xD;
I the policeman, scrutinizing Moses. "What do&#xD;
you know about it ?' asked he of the divine.&#xD;
" I don't know," replied the helpless clergy-&#xD;
man, still wool-gathering. "My certificates-"&#xD;
Here Moses and the policeman were obliged to&#xD;
I dodge a turnip and what appeared to be a piece of&#xD;
a cat thrown in their direction.&#xD;
"Do you permit such things as this ?" asked&#xD;
Moses of the policeman with dignity.&#xD;
" Hey ? That won't do, young man. It won't&#xD;
do at all," replied the policeman with sudden de-&#xD;
cision. "I guess you can come along with me.&#xD;
Perhaps you had better make a fool of a police-&#xD;
sergeant, who's been one for three years and&#xD;
more.   You can come along with me.   Come&#xD;
along I" roared he ferociously, collaring the verily&#xD;
astonished Moses, "and let the judge settle it I"&#xD;
" Eh? What do you mean by this, policeman?&#xD;
I haven't done any thing," exclaimed the latter,&#xD;
refusing to stir, with his coat half pulled over his&#xD;
head. "I1am a stranger. I-I-call upon the&#xD;
small man. If there are any passengers her-"&#xD;
" I'll take him, Spanks," said another police-&#xD;
man who had arrived.  " You take t'other one."&#xD;
Expostulation was of no use xvith the faithful&#xD;
guardians, though the reviving raiser of church&#xD;
funds appeared as much indisposed to submit to&#xD;
the proceedings as Moses. They were trotted off&#xD;
together.  An energetic ,atfempt was made by&#xD;
Moses to address the crowd about him, as the&#xD;
policeman would not listen to him, and an idiotic&#xD;
imitation was instituted toward the remainder by&#xD;
the bewildered clergyman; but they were both&#xD;
ineffectual from their brevity.  Tie policemen&#xD;
urged them at excessive speed down, the street&#xD;
toward that illustrious seat of justice, the Jeffer-&#xD;
son court-house, and a roaring, whobping crowd&#xD;
followed them in ecstasies of delight. The whole&#xD;
procession, for the purpose of shortening the way,&#xD;
tore through a corner grocery, kept by an astound.&#xD;
ed and disgusted German. The clergyman again&#xD;
took leave of his senses at the corner of Sixth&#xD;
Avenue and Tenth street, and our hero was hav-&#xD;
ing unpleasant premonitions of a similar proceed-&#xD;
ing upon his part, when they arrived at the just-&#xD;
ice's court-room of the fourteenth district.&#xD;
It was in this way Moses entered the city. Thus&#xD;
had he, at the very outset of his journey of phi-&#xD;
losophic observation, become suddenly involved&#xD;
in one of those curious and almost inscrutable&#xD;
incidents of human life, which so often surprise&#xD;
the tracer of the hidden chain of cause and effect.&#xD;
Yet under these circumstances his natural bene-&#xD;
volence continued undiminished, and we doubt&#xD;
if the reader will find it otherwise even under&#xD;
others to be recounted in these  a    which&#xD;
were trying enough to drive a common mind&#xD;
to an incurable insanity, or inaugurate a deep-&#xD;
seated malignity for life.&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
MoSE NAB AN OPPORTUNITY OP ODRAVING A STRIt-&#xD;
ING INSTANCE OF JUDICIAL GRANDEUR. A SHORT&#xD;
BUT VINE PIECE OF REASONING.&#xD;
Tna Jefferson Market police court is said to be&#xD;
a favorite dwelling-place of Justice, and it seems&#xD;
very likely, if we suppose the olfactory organs of&#xD;
the goddess are as deficient as her vision. Judge&#xD;
Pootoops's ideas of the administration of the law,&#xD;
like those which Numa derived from his secret&#xD;
nymph in the grove, seemed by their very origi-&#xD;
nality to be inspired. n his decisions he was,&#xD;
no doubt, in invisible consultation with Themis.&#xD;
There is no easier way of accounting for his ex-&#xD;
traordinary wandering and gazes into vacancy in&#xD;
some cases, or his velocitous decisions in others,&#xD;
unless, to speak very plainly, by setting him down&#xD;
as an ass. Were this latter the case, we might&#xD;
here make it our object to show how abstraction-&#xD;
ists of human nature like our hero may be some-&#xD;
times mistaken in a practical application of their&#xD;
ideas, not so much from being fools themselves,&#xD;
according' to the belief of many, as from coming&#xD;
in contact with people who are. Still this would&#xD;
undoubtedly look to those who know Judge Poo-&#xD;
toops, like distorting the truth to show discouttesy&#xD;
So we prefer to report the incidents of Moses's&#xD;
examination, and let the reader draw from them&#xD;
whatever lesson he pleases.&#xD;
The justice had been seated in his court-room&#xD;
full an hour previous to the customary evening&#xD;
session of the day, in company with his constable&#xD;
or clerk. We mention his habit of expending&#xD;
the most of his.leisure time locked therein, to in&#xD;
timate not merely the studious retirement demand&#xD;
ed by his position as judge, but also his sensitive&#xD;
unwillingness to obtrude himself upon those witi&#xD;
whom he had a hopeless diversity of opinion&#xD;
Such a diversity chronically existed between hin&#xD;
and his landlady upon the subject of his boar&#xD;
bill, and he wisely took this method of avoidin[&#xD;
unnecessary contact with her. He was attired it&#xD;
a flannel dressing-gown, thus resembling, in sQm&#xD;
measure, the picturesque presentment of an Ame&#xD;
rican Indian chief, and was meditating with som&#xD;
feeling no doubt upon the above matter; while&#xD;
his friend and constable was contorting himsel&#xD;
with a needle in hardy endeavors to repair a ren&#xD;
in the rear of his habiliments, when the trampin&#xD;
noise of Moses's terrible escort was heard below&#xD;
and immediately the stair-ease leading to th&#xD;
court-room  resounded with dreadful scufflinC&#xD;
stamping and human cries. The constable starte&#xD;
up and the judge turned pale from association&#xD;
ideas. As the door was cautiously opened by th&#xD;
former, a great rush was made upon him. Th&#xD;
two prisoners had been temporarily thrust int&#xD;
the adjoining station-house, and the court-root&#xD;
was now filled with the crowd, -as uickly as&#xD;
vacuum exposed to the access of !soda wat&#xD;
under a pressure of an unusual number of poun&#xD;
to the square inch, and with a species of the sam&#xD;
effervescing noise. Fighting, squeezing and vil&#xD;
fication took place, and it was not until the justit&#xD;
had recovered from three attacks of board-bill ve&#xD;
tigo in the private room 10 which he had recreate&#xD;
that the majority of the crowd had pushed othe&#xD;
from their seats and arranged themselves. Ti&#xD;
whistling and eat-calls were promptly suppress&#xD;
by the indignant constable, as the re-assurt&#xD;
&#xD;
[KFIELD.&#xD;
judge finally appeared, took his seat, and leaned&#xD;
his brow upon his hand. An impressive silence&#xD;
ensued.&#xD;
"Silence!" roared the constable.&#xD;
The official-hour had arrived, and the justice&#xD;
opened the session for the examination of the&#xD;
day's offenders. A negro was introduced and sent&#xD;
back committed for having gone into a strange&#xD;
room, like the sweet south o'er a bank of violets,&#xD;
and two intoxicated sailors for fighting each other&#xD;
and peaceable citizens on the highways. Thejudge&#xD;
began to feel from the unappeased state of the&#xD;
audience that a very unusual offense against the&#xD;
lawa had been committed, perhaps, of a deeply&#xD;
atrocious nature. The door of the adjoining sta-&#xD;
tion-house opened again, and the Rev. Mr. Adri-&#xD;
ance was brought in by the sergeant and a police-&#xD;
man, with his head sunk in his shoulders, and ap-&#xD;
pearing generally a mass of something indefinite.&#xD;
" Ha I the corpse !" cried the judge, starting.&#xD;
"Where is the accused? Let the accused be&#xD;
brought in I" The policeman packed the clergy-&#xD;
man into an arm-chair, and while one of them was&#xD;
attempting to disabuse the mind of the court as&#xD;
to the nature of the case, the station-house door&#xD;
again opened and our hero was shoved violently&#xD;
- into the room by unseen parties. As he turned&#xD;
, his indignant organs of vision toward his pro-&#xD;
pellers, the door was slammed again, and with&#xD;
this want of ceremony, was Moses's first official&#xD;
introduction to the presence of the great Themis&#xD;
completed.&#xD;
The policeman ramblingly stated what he did&#xD;
e not knowabout the case, but what he thought might&#xD;
have been, and then a somewhat disagreeable&#xD;
- silence ensued. The judge stared inquiringl'y at&#xD;
- the policeman the policeman looked at the con-&#xD;
e stable, the constable gazed at the audience, and&#xD;
h the audience at our hero. The latter, like the&#xD;
. person at the end of a chain of electrical experi-&#xD;
menters, felt the accumulated force of the whole&#xD;
d on himself. In addition to this, the constable's&#xD;
g attention here becoming wholly absorbed by a&#xD;
n person in the audience, whom he had detected&#xD;
e in laughing and showing other irrepressible signs&#xD;
- of amusement at him, the wheels of justice seem-&#xD;
e ed to be stopping altogether. The hesitation of&#xD;
e proceedings might have been indefinitely con-&#xD;
f tinued, had not Moses recovered his presence of&#xD;
t mind..                             .&#xD;
g    "May it please your honor, sir," said he, re-&#xD;
K, spectfully to the judge, "it is with unfeigned&#xD;
e feelings of mingled as-"&#xD;
g,   "Silence I Wait tillyou're asked I How dare&#xD;
d you address the court ?" cried the constable, en-&#xD;
of ergetically forcing his indignant gaze from the&#xD;
e spectator who was smiling at him toward Moses.&#xD;
e "Silence !"&#xD;
o    "I respect the laws of my country and its au-&#xD;
m  thorities, and I therefore cheerfully obey you,"&#xD;
a replied Moses.&#xD;
er    "I .guess so, I guess so," said the constable,&#xD;
ds "and let me tell every one in this court, that the&#xD;
ne rules of the court will be enforced. Silence&#xD;
ii- roared he, reverting his gaze severely toward the&#xD;
ce smiling maiimn1the audience.&#xD;
r- " Constable, conscience appears to have already&#xD;
d, made an impression upon the offender," said te&#xD;
rs judge majestically. ",He may proceed. Pro-&#xD;
he ceed with your confession, pi-isoner i".&#xD;
ed " But I am not an offender," cried Moses, his&#xD;
ed anger getting the better of his judgment, "and&#xD;

" Hold! wait!" cried the judge, with sudden plicity in the matter he was entirely unable to&#xD;

I shall discharge you both, consequently. And-&#xD;
what is the matter, constable?"&#xD;
"Your honor, I hope you will keep order in&#xD;
this court," said the latter. " Ever since this&#xD;
here session commenced the constable of this&#xD;
court has been the subject of the constant con-&#xD;
tempt of some-soap-fat man present here. I&#xD;
know it? Let him deny it if he can!"&#xD;
" I'll fine him presently. Let there be no un-&#xD;
due levity here !  Fellow-citizens, there is no-&#xD;
thing in this case which calls for remark, but its&#xD;
illustration of a maxim which I think I have al-&#xD;
luded to before in this court, and which I have&#xD;
come to the conclusion ought to be incorporated&#xD;
as a fundamental principle of the law. The&#xD;
maxim is, that 'in every piece of mischief you&#xD;
will find a woman at the bottom.' There is but&#xD;
a short chain of cause and effect between the in-&#xD;
sane female who originally incited this reverend&#xD;
gentleman to this plan of a church, by donating&#xD;
to him her property,.and the present predica-&#xD;
ment in which he is placed. If the lamented&#xD;
Simms hadn't given you the nest-egg for a&#xD;
church, Mr. Minister, you wouldn't have com.&#xD;
menced a church; if you hadn't commenced a&#xD;
church, you wouldn't be going about soliciting&#xD;
subscriptions from imbeciles in cars; if you&#xD;
hadn't solicited a subscription from the one in&#xD;
the Harlem car, you would not have been suffo-&#xD;
cated by him, or been here, nor the other party&#xD;
either I"&#xD;
Our hero had had time to collect himself be-&#xD;
low, and his ideas of injury and injustice had&#xD;
given place to a determination to appeal more&#xD;
calmly to the authorities upon his detention. In&#xD;
satisfaction he now fixed his gaze upon the ma-&#xD;
gistrate's brow.  He seemed endeavoring to&#xD;
descry within the physical working of the powers&#xD;
which produced this profound piece of ratio-&#xD;
cination. Expressions of deep interest were also&#xD;
plainly observable upon numerous of the specta-&#xD;
tors, and even the clergyman now stared con-&#xD;
fusedly at the learned judge.  There were no&#xD;
more cases, and the constable was ordered to&#xD;
incontinently clear the court-room.&#xD;
The learned court here betook itself to its pri-&#xD;
vate room. The constable glared at the sniliug&#xD;
spectator, who was leaving with the rest of the&#xD;
audience, and while the clergyman, flourishing&#xD;
his certificates, was frantically endeavoring to&#xD;
procure that functionary's assistance in stopping&#xD;
the departing crowd, our hero took occasion to&#xD;
disappear also.&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
WHILE AWAITING THE, ARRIVAL OF HIS UNCLE&#xD;
MR. EFFINGHAM TOPLADY, MOSES ENJOYS THI&#xD;
SOCIETY OF THE HOTEL.&#xD;
THIS work, properly considered, ought to b&#xD;
held as strictly philosophical.  Some reader&#xD;
may laugh, but what of that?  We have knowi&#xD;
the writings of some of the most serious author&#xD;
upon the most momentous subjects, which hay&#xD;
caused every one who read them to laugh cor&#xD;
sumedly from beginning to end. But that is n&#xD;
reason why the serious import of a work shoul&#xD;
not be respected. The emotion of levity, in fac&#xD;
&#xD;
p&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
rE&#xD;
&#xD;
9&#xD;
&#xD;
is said by some philosophers to be merely a mix-&#xD;
ed one, resulting from the presence and contest&#xD;
of two or more of the serious emotions. Is it&#xD;
the subject, then, of any work, or the author's&#xD;
treatment of any subject, which causes it in the&#xD;
reader ?  No. It plainly depends upon the abil-&#xD;
ity of the reader himself to entertain more than&#xD;
one serious emotion at a time upon his diaphragm.&#xD;
If he is of a weak,-unnerved disposition, he will&#xD;
laugh. If he is firm, strong, and thorough-braced,&#xD;
he will proceed rationally from the beginning to&#xD;
the end of his perusal, and rise so much the&#xD;
wiser therefrom by having thoroughly imbibed&#xD;
the true 'eiritof the work, instead of was g&#xD;
his time in idle titillation of his lighter being.&#xD;
Having started out with the sound assump-&#xD;
tion that the most subtle and powerful springs&#xD;
of man's nature   are as frequently played&#xD;
upon in the ordinary intercourse of civilized&#xD;
beings of this age and country as in that of any&#xD;
other, we have proposed to observe such inci-&#xD;
dents in the adventures of our hero and his co-&#xD;
temporaries as will illustrate the principles of this&#xD;
great science; and while we shall endeavor to&#xD;
leave no incident untouched upon, which forms a&#xD;
necessary link of action, we shall not hesitate&#xD;
to devote the space which is usually occupied by&#xD;
mere microscopic narration of dry events in&#xD;
works of a less philosophical tone, to such reflec-&#xD;
tions as our hero or others may make, even upon&#xD;
subjects which may not be strictly akin to the&#xD;
topic of the moment. Such, for instance, as the&#xD;
moral right of jockeys to dock horses' tails, or&#xD;
of belligerents to dock neutrals' heads, etc., etc.,&#xD;
so intense is our sympathy with him for, general&#xD;
science.&#xD;
While experiencing his short legal durance, and&#xD;
reflecting upon the cards of address accompany-&#xD;
ing the frequent baskets of fruit and preserves,,&#xD;
dispatched by his uncle .to his grandmother,&#xD;
Moses had pictured in his mind that uncle, Mr.&#xD;
Effingham Toplady, seated reading in his parlor&#xD;
at the Evercroft House, all unconscious of his&#xD;
own trouble or propinquity. Upon eaching the&#xD;
hotel, he discovered that his relative was tempo-&#xD;
rarily absent at a country water-cure.&#xD;
"If there be any thing to be done for you,&#xD;
however," remarked the pleasing clerk, "you&#xD;
need no prophetic soul, sir-a quotation excusa-&#xD;
ble from its aptness-to point out our proprietor&#xD;
as your uncle, ha! ha! Will your stay be long&#xD;
or short ? Or, perhaps, sir, you may divide your&#xD;
sojourn into two periods, and have a pair of stays,&#xD;
ha! ha! You will excuse the remark from its&#xD;
point, sir !"&#xD;
Moses smiled benevolently at the playful yet&#xD;
courteous spirit of the gentleman, and apprised&#xD;
him of the uncertainty of his plans. Thereupon&#xD;
the affable clerk, still pursuing his playful course,&#xD;
proposed to put him into a seven by ten chamber,&#xD;
with a sky-light, in the fifth story. But Moses,.&#xD;
promptly considering that the humor of the joke&#xD;
would consist chiefly in refusing to be placed&#xD;
e there, was finally put into a commodiousparlor&#xD;
s with an inner bedroom, upon the second floor,&#xD;
n and pleasantly adjacent to a man with the gout,&#xD;
s by whose scientific swearing he might be divert-&#xD;
e ed at almost any hour of the day. Thus agree-&#xD;
t- ably domiciled, Moses's reflections naturally turn-&#xD;
o ed for a while upon his advent tdott 1populous&#xD;
d world around him. But as it is said tha tewir&#xD;
t, does most, who gives his reader the most know-&#xD;
&#xD;
ledge and takes from him the least time, we wi&#xD;
merely mention the apothegm which wound u&#xD;
his meditations, that "in virtue alone lies tru&#xD;
happiness," and proceed with our narration.&#xD;
The first objects which attracted his attention&#xD;
both as a philosopher and as a man, were natu&#xD;
rally those which were immediately surroundin&#xD;
him. He felt the infinity of the fields of specu&#xD;
lation and amusement, when he saw that h&#xD;
could be entertained for over an hour at dinner&#xD;
solely by conjectures upon the character of th&#xD;
person who sat opposite to him. Even the stud&#xD;
of the end of that person's nose, in the variou&#xD;
ramifications of the sciences necessary to explai&#xD;
the causes of its shape, tissues, or color, coul&#xD;
furnish a meditative mind with occupation for.&#xD;
month. The color of it solely would bring before&#xD;
him the whole science of optics, the fine art o&#xD;
painting, and the mesthetic knowledge of th&#xD;
various wines in favor at the present day. T&#xD;
classify facts and educe general principles there&#xD;
from, is no small job to the unstudious mind, bu&#xD;
so habituated was our hero to analogies, tha&#xD;
such work was rathet-instinctive than the labori&#xD;
ous bending of attention. So, for instance, ho&#xD;
immediately began to observe a resemblance be&#xD;
tween the character of his vis-a-vis and that withi&#xD;
whichUlysses's men were endowed by the kind&#xD;
attention of the siren Circe.&#xD;
In two and a half days he became habituated&#xD;
to the semi-public life of the hotel, and even&#xD;
began to create some sensation. Like a man&#xD;
upon a pinnacle,'though a little dizzy with hi&#xD;
eminence, he thus secured an immediate oppor&#xD;
tunity of surveying human peculiarities. In fact&#xD;
so popular was his affability, which possessed the&#xD;
charm of being real, that the unanimity of ad&#xD;
mirers had but two exceptions. These were a&#xD;
young lady in blue, of seventeen, who objected in&#xD;
secret despondency to his appellation - what&#xD;
illusion would there be in saying beneath the&#xD;
softened chandelier of a retired alcove, " Dearest&#xD;
Moses !" and the other was the principal beau of&#xD;
the establishment, who felt a violent desire to&#xD;
wipe out the new-comer by a short conversation-&#xD;
al encounter, and at the same time a painful con-&#xD;
sciousness of his inability to do it.&#xD;
Upon the third evening of his domicile, Moses&#xD;
found himself seated after dinner upon a sofa&#xD;
between two lady residents of the hotel, with&#xD;
whomhe was' promised an agreeable hour's inter-&#xD;
course. One was a widow with a large fortune,&#xD;
the other a single lady with a moderate one. The&#xD;
former was ornamented, according to the fashion&#xD;
of the day, with a tia-a serving as the bier of the&#xD;
golden effigy of a defunct lap-dogy, the other with,&#xD;
a monster butterfly perched upon a gemmed&#xD;
roost. After a series of courteous smiles and&#xD;
graceful contortions upon the part of all three, a&#xD;
conversation ensued, which we have selected&#xD;
from many more brilliant ones he took part in,&#xD;
because it is brief, and moreover because it is&#xD;
our duty to chronicle matters which are not so&#xD;
much captivating to the public, as instructive to&#xD;
our hero.&#xD;
"Is it not delightful, Miss Stacy," said the&#xD;
widow lady to the other, "to have one so fresh&#xD;
as our young friend to entertain us ?--and so&#xD;
talented as I understand lhe is !"&#xD;
" Indeed, it is so. But although he must suc-&#xD;
cumb to the charms of your society, Louisa,"&#xD;
replied the single lady, Miss Stacy, with an air&#xD;
&#xD;
illI of archness; "you must not monopolize him&#xD;
p dearest!"  ,o                         h&#xD;
C   " My dear Julia, how can you accuse me of&#xD;
that ?" said the other reproachfully; "justice&#xD;
n, alone would lead me to respect the right to which&#xD;
i- your address has entitled you."&#xD;
g    4Address 1" said the fair Miss Stacy, looking&#xD;
i- askance at Moses.&#xD;
e    " Certainly, address in securing h'im. I men-&#xD;

e this talent of yours deserves to be known."&#xD;
y    "Ali! indeed, I thank yon very muhi bui&#xD;
s perhaps I am wrong, my dearest Louisa, in shar-&#xD;
i ing his society with you. Gentlemen's society&#xD;
d has been so unfortunately a void to you lately I"&#xD;
a "What are they driving at ?" said Moses to&#xD;
c himself. "This is a very extraordinary conver-&#xD;
f sation r'&#xD;
o    " Really, do not display your magnanimity so&#xD;
o soon, Julia," replied the lively Mrs. Plummer.&#xD;
.- "r, Winkficld may do you an injustice, per-&#xD;
t haps, by attributing to your heart that which is&#xD;
t due solely to your intellect."&#xD;
-   "In-deed'!" responded the other.  I am so&#xD;
e happy to see, Mrs. Plummer, that you can discern&#xD;
- so well mind in others. Next to the possession&#xD;
of intellect, is certainly the appreciation of it."&#xD;
I     They don't seem to be addressing me at all I"&#xD;
observed the astonished Moses to himself.&#xD;
I   " And fortune has favored you, Julia, With&#xD;
both ; not only with a lofty intellect," continued&#xD;
Mrs. Plummer, "but a still loftier appreciation&#xD;
S of it."&#xD;
-   "My dear Louisa, it is easy to fail in being&#xD;
either witty or good-natured by trying to be both.&#xD;
Dear friend, when my qualities are the subject of&#xD;
- your thoughts, I would neither have the brilliance&#xD;
with which you should be inspired lost in ill-&#xD;
temper nor the good nature in stupidity."&#xD;
" I-ladies," said Moses.&#xD;
" Ahem-to change that subject then, my dear&#xD;
Julia, as it is perhaps uninteresing, and to amuse&#xD;
f Mr. Winkfield, suppose you now sing your song 9"&#xD;
continued Mrs. Plummer, as Moses was about&#xD;
opening his mouth. "I am determined those&#xD;
rude operatic people up-stairs, who said it was&#xD;
fortunate you knew but one, shall hear it again&#xD;
and again, until they retract their jealous reniark&#xD;
or leave the house. You shall triumph over&#xD;
them, my dear Julia."&#xD;
At these remarks, Moses observed immediately&#xD;
in front of his face, a frantic desire upon the part&#xD;
of the butterfly to insert his feelers into the brains&#xD;
of the poodle. He was about to insist with a&#xD;
mixture of gallantry and concern upon the plea-&#xD;
sure of hecaringr the charming Stacy, when she&#xD;
herself interposed.&#xD;
" How cold it is here, my dear Mr". Plummer"&#xD;
said she. " Won't you have smy shawl? Think&#xD;
of a cough entailed Upon you at yos age !"&#xD;
"Eli! Oh 10no; I will not deprive you of. it,&#xD;
my dear Julia-Miss Stacy. Oh! 110-11 11a i&#xD;
ha! No-really-ahem. Ha ! ha! You have&#xD;
really no idea how much improvement your&#xD;
figure derives from having something, in fact-&#xD;
thrown over it V"&#xD;
The confused Moses was still staring stupidly&#xD;
at their head-dresses, nd lie here imagined lh&#xD;
saw an alarming futy in the butterfly, wvbile an&#xD;
insane expression of malignant hatred alppeared&#xD;
to settle upon the lincamenits of the lap-dog.&#xD;

have no chance to join in, occasionally even. I&#xD;

"Excuse me. One moment, Louisa !" here&#xD;
whispered Miss Stacy to her friend. "Adjust&#xD;
your hair, the back locks are coming off. Let&#xD;
me arrange them for youV"&#xD;
" Thank you, never mind. By the way, Julia,&#xD;
what a pity it is the fashion of the Chilian ladies&#xD;
in covering the face also, with their shawls, has&#xD;
not been introduced here. It would be so be-&#xD;
coming to you, dear Julia !"&#xD;
"Aih I speaking of the Chilian ladies l" said&#xD;
Moses, in some haste, desperately grasping at this&#xD;
opportunity. "They-"&#xD;
" Excuse me, one moment, Pardon me if I&#xD;
was a little inattentive, Louisa. But I was really&#xD;
admiring your teeth," here interrupted the other&#xD;
again, having feigned a momentary abstraction.&#xD;
"The set you are wearing to-night are indeed&#xD;
beautiful. Who made then? Are they from&#xD;
Parmer or Trenely "   I&#xD;
"Heavens! I-I-44-bt do you know, my&#xD;
dearest Stacy," gasped th6 other wildly, like one&#xD;
losing her senses, "I must insist upon your ceas-&#xD;
ing to take that cordial for your complexion! Dr.&#xD;
Sterling says that it certainly is composed chiefly&#xD;
of an obnoxious berry, the juniper and--"&#xD;
" Ma-am!"' said the other.&#xD;
They -here arose, to Moses's culminated aston-&#xD;
ishment, excused themselves hastily, and, leaving&#xD;
him quite unregarded upon the sofa, rapidly pro-&#xD;
ceeded from the room together, as if actuated by&#xD;
some similar and very powerful motive. So great&#xD;
was his confusion at this rapid termination of the&#xD;
intercourse, in which he had not been able to&#xD;
make a single remark, that he followed them dis-&#xD;
tractedly into the hall, from which he observed&#xD;
them disappearing into a small parlor on its op-&#xD;
posite side and closing the door after thdm.&#xD;
Now although he was well versed in the science&#xD;
of human nature, he did not know that persons&#xD;
of strong sensibilities, especially females who&#xD;
have been disappointed in having any one to&#xD;
love, may sometimes prefer the truly thrilling&#xD;
ecstasy of hate to the quiet placidity of mere&#xD;
friendship, and may chronically seek to afford&#xD;
each other a mutual opportunity of indulging in&#xD;
that ferveit passion. , And if he had known it,&#xD;
he probably would not have applied the principle&#xD;
to the present case. On the contrary, he pre-&#xD;
ferred the equally tenable theory that they were&#xD;
much attached to each other, and were only a&#xD;
little eccentric in their method of showing it.&#xD;
Of course it was especially natural for them to&#xD;
manifest much impatience of each other's scorn.&#xD;
when they at bottom ardently prized each other's&#xD;
friendship.  Therefore, as to any sounds of&#xD;
thumping, scratching, and subdued respiration&#xD;
which he may or may not have heard subsequent&#xD;
ly 9mainating from the small parlor, if they ar&#xD;
not to be referred to a dramatic intensification o&#xD;
the sane principle, they may at least be consider&#xD;
ed as the hallucination of his excited mind. H(&#xD;
was not positive about it, nor was he positive&#xD;
either, on their emerging from the room, which&#xD;
lie shortly saw them do and go up-stairs, that th&#xD;
head-dres of one was torn in slits, or that th&#xD;
butterfly hiad disappeared with his perch an'&#xD;
some hair from the head of the other. lIe wa&#xD;
only po-itive that lie thought he saw it, and we&#xD;
of course, have no right to assume he did. -&#xD;
&#xD;
It would be transcending our prerogative, al-&#xD;
though, if we could, we might undertake to give&#xD;
this chapter extraordinary point by asserting that&#xD;
such a private method of settling differences is&#xD;
just as rational and far less hazardous to the sta-&#xD;
bility of society than the other ordinarily in&#xD;
vogue among the softer sex of open recrimina-&#xD;
tion and hysterics.&#xD;
Our hero was unfortunately deprived of Mrs.&#xD;
Plummer's society shortly afterward, the latter&#xD;
being called to temporarily visit an aged relative&#xD;
at Boston.  But Miss Stacy remained and en-&#xD;
gaged him in numerous conversations, not only&#xD;
giving him a pleasing opportunity to ventilate his&#xD;
philosophy, but appearing earnestly desirous of&#xD;
seizing the chance to inspire him with the tender&#xD;
eloquence of personal confidence.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.,&#xD;
MOSES AND MR. TOPLADY PROCEED TO INDULGE IN&#xD;
THE ENTERTAINMENT OFFERED BY AN EVENING&#xD;
PARTY. THE PLEASING INCIDENTS AND CON-&#xD;
VERSATIONS THEREAT.&#xD;
THE following week Moses's uncle returned to&#xD;
the city. The presence of his nephew infused&#xD;
such spirits into Mr. Toplady as to cause him to&#xD;
give a carter of a dollar respectively to two beg-&#xD;
gars at the hotel door, which remarkable act upon&#xD;
his part was regarded by all as a proof of his un-&#xD;
usual satisfaction. Mr. Toplady had lived, for a&#xD;
few years past, a retired life. Possessed of a&#xD;
moderate fortune, he led what is generally called&#xD;
the life of a gentleman, although, being aware&#xD;
that among the more censorious this is sometimes&#xD;
invidiously designated as that of a loafer, he had,&#xD;
for the sake of avoiding the ignommious appella-&#xD;
tion, kept an office for the wholesale of Italian&#xD;
raisins, judiciously located in a place where no&#xD;
one in pursuit thereof would be likely to find&#xD;
him.   Having become somewhat suspicious of&#xD;
human nature, especially of the femimfine side, he&#xD;
lived quite exclusive of society; but to giv6 his&#xD;
nephew an opportunity, lie resolved to come out&#xD;
and even hazard the dangers of an evening party&#xD;
or two.&#xD;
" I have a pleasant affair for you, Moses," said&#xD;
he, two or three days subsequently, in pursuance&#xD;
of this magnanimous resolve. "Mrs. Fasherlidge&#xD;
is to meet some friends to-night. I know Fasher-&#xD;
lidge. Fine, good-hearted fellow. I did him a&#xD;
business favor once and he didn't cut me for it.&#xD;
,They say his wife is very fond of these affairs,&#xD;
, and it will undoubtedly be a delightful evening."&#xD;
" And the peculiarities of city society are so&#xD;
f new to me, I shall doubly enjoy it," replied Moses.&#xD;
Mr. Toplady was well aware that the style of&#xD;
- manners in vogue in the metropolis was derived&#xD;
e from the same choice source whence emanate the&#xD;
f unique costumes which succeed each other in the&#xD;
- round of fashion. lie considered also that the&#xD;
e same pretty much consisted in the intellectqal&#xD;
e triumph of having no friends, laughing at ac-&#xD;
h quaintances, and staring strangers out of counte-&#xD;
e nance. So he secretly felt he ought to here cau-&#xD;
O tion Moses on these little fashionable peculiarities.&#xD;
d " You inqst not mind any of the careless free-&#xD;
.s dom from restraint which you meet with, Moses,"&#xD;
~, said he carelessly. " Reckless love of fun of&#xD;
iNew-York young people, you know."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Of course not," replied'Moses benevolently&#xD;
"Where no offense is intended it only makes th&#xD;
occasion the more spirited."&#xD;
" Oh! yes. There will be freedom and noise&#xD;
gayety enough there, I warrant you. That's th&#xD;
thing. Every one is full of life at our New-Yorl&#xD;
parties; all hilarity and mirth."&#xD;
" Well I like it; it is certainly much bette&#xD;
than ceremony," replied our hero, "certainly.'&#xD;
Carried with his uncle in a coup to the Fash&#xD;
erlidge residence in the evening, Moses notice&#xD;
many carriages standing in front, both the driver&#xD;
and horses of which seemed desirous of vyinc&#xD;
with the stock-stillness of the vehicles. As the'&#xD;
entered the hall, the same refined quiet still ap&#xD;
peared, somewhat unexpectedly to them, to reign&#xD;
"All! we are, perhaps, a little early," whis&#xD;
pered Mr. Toplady to Moses. "Not many hav&#xD;
arrived yet.'..&#xD;
A domestic, who had been gazing at their over&#xD;
coats in subdued anxiety, here pointed silently t&#xD;
the staircase, like a bandit chief, afflicted with&#xD;
tie toothache, ordering his prisoners to theii&#xD;
garret; and mounting to the dressing-room, oui&#xD;
friends were prepared for the occasion below by&#xD;
a similar dreary blockhead, who seemed to enter&#xD;
tim humane scruples against divulging the des&#xD;
tination of the visitors. Returning, a faint sound&#xD;
of whispered conversation was all that fell upon&#xD;
their cars as they approached the parlor door.&#xD;
"'You may go in !" said the bandit chief, now&#xD;
softening his manner to that of a sexton.&#xD;
Eli  said Mr. Toplady, somewhat confusedly.&#xD;
"Many guests in there yet, Thomas ?"&#xD;
A good many of the church has arrove," re&#xD;
plied the domestic solemnly.  "Dr. Coddle hasn't&#xD;
come yet though."&#xD;
Good gracious ! what is the matter with the&#xD;
servants ?" murmured Moses to his uncle. "And&#xD;
this dreadful stillness ! Can the family have met&#xD;
with any domestic trouble which-"&#xD;
Eli ?" said Mr Toplady, hesitating. " Has&#xD;
any trouble occurred in the house, my man,&#xD;
which prevents-"&#xD;
Oi! no. Walk right in, sirs," replied the&#xD;
domestic, in the delicate tone of a sympathetic&#xD;
undertaker.   There is no trouble-leastwise not&#xD;
until supper."&#xD;
Our friends opened the door and entered. A&#xD;
more audible sound struck their ears, but it still&#xD;
seemed exceedingly disproportionate to the large&#xD;
number of guests which they beheld in the apart-&#xD;
ment. If it were a gathering for social diversion,&#xD;
it certainly appeared as if a slight paralysis of the&#xD;
festive faculties in requisition upon such occasions&#xD;
Must have been lately visited upon the parties&#xD;
engaged therein. Some of them were gazing into&#xD;
vacancy, with what really seemed to Moses to be&#xD;
a strong air of helplessness; others appeared to&#xD;
manifest a stern expectation of beiig relieved by&#xD;
these; while several of the less spell-bound were&#xD;
valkimg about, as if humanely endeavoring, by&#xD;
gentle conversation and velvet foot-falls, to break&#xD;
the enchantment without undue violence. A gen-&#xD;
tleman who had been seated in a corner of the rear&#xD;
room, indulging in the healthful practice of warm-&#xD;
in- his feet, arose and came toward them.&#xD;
Alh Toplady! I am   glad you have come.&#xD;
You n-ill, 110 doubt, enjoy the evening vei-y much,"&#xD;
said this gentleman, after the salutations. Ihere&#xD;
lie paused, and cast about the room a look which&#xD;
was rather expressive of the lively feelings of&#xD;
&#xD;
. hatred and disgust than any thing else, and wlich&#xD;
e seemed to deprive him of any desire to continue&#xD;
the conversation with them.&#xD;
y    "Mrs. Fasherlidge is still dressing, but she&#xD;
e will be down directly," continued he, hesitating.&#xD;
k " And excuse me-I'll see you again during&#xD;
the evening, of course." With these words lie&#xD;
r walked off toward the retreat from whence he&#xD;
" had emanated.&#xD;
-   Upon recovering from their surprise at this un-&#xD;
I expected decarnpment of the host-for such the&#xD;
s gentleman was-Mr. Toplady and Moses were&#xD;
g about resolving to cross the room, or do some-&#xD;
y thing else very desperate, when a very gorgeous-&#xD;
- ly dressed lady entered the apartment, and suc-&#xD;
. cessively saluted the guests. The sensation of&#xD;
- this event commanded the presence of the spirit-&#xD;
e ed host again. He emerged, and presently intro-&#xD;
duced our friends to the lady as his wife.&#xD;
" I pray you take seats, gentlemen," said the&#xD;
o latter rather loftily, and glancing significantly at&#xD;
her husband.&#xD;
r   " Mr. Toplady is a gentleman of wealth and&#xD;
r leisure, whom  you will be proud to know, my&#xD;
dear," said Mr. Fasherlidge, seeming to derive&#xD;
- some malignant pleasure from making his whis-&#xD;
per quite audible.&#xD;
" Ali! allow me to welcome you to our humble&#xD;
palace," said she, with a sudden smile of gmeat&#xD;
sweetness. "Excuse us; in endeavoring to offer&#xD;
instruction as well as amusement to our friends,&#xD;
we struggle for diffused ease as the first requisite&#xD;
amid the magnificence of our entertainments.&#xD;
We make them as unconventional as possible,&#xD;
- you observe. Do you not think we are judicious ?&#xD;
Excuse ceremony, sirs."&#xD;
" Thank you-not at all!" replied our friends&#xD;
warmly.&#xD;
" You can leave," said Mrs. Fasherlidge, sud-&#xD;
denly turning to her husband, and smiling upon&#xD;
him conjugally. "As you are not wanted here&#xD;
now, you can go up and sit with the child. You&#xD;
know I shall require all the domestics, and can&#xD;
not spare Gretchen. Such singular misfortune!&#xD;
Children invariably are taken with the hooping-&#xD;
cough just when our attention is absolutely re-&#xD;
quired in other matters !" observed she, in gra-&#xD;
ciots apology, to Mr. Toplady, as her husband&#xD;
left. "Yes, the empty refinements of fashion we&#xD;
in particular disregard. Some particular enter-&#xD;
tainments will commence directly, in which we&#xD;
sincerely hope you will join. In'the mean time&#xD;
you will excuse my immediate society."&#xD;
At this she very cruelly but gracefully with-&#xD;
drew from therm.&#xD;
"I suppose it is because I've been so long un.&#xD;
used to these affairs I feel a little awkward,"&#xD;
whispered Mr. Toplady, after they had been seat-&#xD;
ed for a moment near the wall. 1"Don't you ex-&#xD;
perience a hind of unnaturalness in the flow of&#xD;
your feelings at these evening parties, Moses V"&#xD;
" Well-yes. I must say I do feel a kind of&#xD;
stiffness now. They don't seem to be doing -much&#xD;
here," replied Moses doubtfully. "lHowever, it&#xD;
will wear away soon, won't it? Miss Stacy told&#xD;
me she was going to be here."&#xD;
"Ali! and there she is-see her-by the win-&#xD;
dow, with those gentlemen amind ladies examining&#xD;
the stereoscop~es," replied Mr. Toplady, somew-hat&#xD;
ielieved. "Suppose I findh out fi-om her if-if the&#xD;
guests are expected-to do any thing unusual to-&#xD;
night. .You sit still. I'll be back presently."&#xD;

Moses did sit still. In fact, he had begun to  "Yes," replied Moses, thoroughly overcome&#xD;

otherwise. Near him sat two ladies in conversa-  "There is a sweet pleasure in the contempla-&#xD;

of his sojourn, Syria. He will review the nature&#xD;

incidents connected with the inimical and truly&#xD;
diabolical spirit manifested toward him and his&#xD;
enterprise generally by the benighted native of&#xD;
that region while dwelling in their midst. I have&#xD;
the pleasure-that is, Mrs. Fasherlidge and my-&#xD;
.self-have the pleasure of introducing to you the&#xD;
Rev. Mr. Witling."&#xD;
A young gentleman of pleasant staidness o&#xD;
demeanor was at once led from his place of con-&#xD;
cealment by the hand of the amiable hostess, and&#xD;
surely enough, a lecture upon one of the most&#xD;
interesting climes of the East was fairly inaugu-&#xD;
rated.  Although Moses had expected another&#xD;
class of entertainments, he lent a deep attention&#xD;
to the matter, and felt a profound gratitude to&#xD;
his worthy hostshfor the instructive one which&#xD;
wvas thus offered him.&#xD;
" After all," thought he, "it is perhaps well&#xD;
that a part of evening erntertainments should be&#xD;
rationally spent in the derivation of useful in-&#xD;
formation. A short running account of foreign&#xD;
adventures, with statistics left out, would fill up a&#xD;
gap in a truly delightful manner."&#xD;
This was at the commencement of the lecture.&#xD;
After the lapse of about thirty minutes, he arose&#xD;
very quietly and, seeking the hall, proceeded to&#xD;
the rear drawing-room for the purpose of imme-&#xD;
diately finding, his uncle. Tile door of a small&#xD;
room upon the opposite side was half open, and&#xD;
he looked in. Two or three guests were engaged&#xD;
in low conversation therein.&#xD;
"Pardon mne! I was looking for my uncle,&#xD;
Mr. Toplady. The oriental gentleman making&#xD;
the remarks in the other room," said he hesitat-&#xD;
ing, "was dwelling at some'length upon the'&#xD;
Arabs' methods of constructing their ice-houses.&#xD;
As, I amn familiar with ice-houses, I thought I&#xD;
would leave for a moment."'&#xD;
" 01,! walk in, sir," said a solemn gentleman.&#xD;
" Well, I villa. I will await here, if you please,&#xD;
till the dancing is announced and then-"&#xD;
"I begr your pardon, but I believe there is to&#xD;
be no dancing, sir, 7said a young lady graciously.&#xD;
"The practice is not known in this house, sir,"&#xD;
said the solemn gentleman rather sternly. "Our&#xD;
Worthy hostess has feelings in consonance with&#xD;
mine, sir, and that 'of every other American&#xD;
mother. I repeat in behalf of that worthy lady,&#xD;
unseemly frisking and languishing with th'e legs,&#xD;
though tolerated in some frivolous households&#xD;
arc not known here, sir. Not a solitary frisk,&#xD;
Sir."&#xD;
"Ah! I must beg her pardon," replied Moses.&#xD;
"I was not aware she was among those who re-&#xD;
gard that amusement with disfavor.."&#xD;
"With disfavor! Her eyes were first opened&#xD;
to the pernicious results of dancing at an early&#xD;
period, sir, when a young and thoughtless friend&#xD;
of hers, in coming from a dancing party, was&#xD;
thrown from her wagon andsbroke her leg. 3ihe&#xD;
and others are aware too, sir, that her second&#xD;
cousin was born hopelessly cross-eyed, which she&#xD;
never would have been if her mother had not&#xD;
first met her cross-eyed father at a hall. I for&#xD;
my part can't see what there is il it. What&#xD;
pleasure now would there be in waltzing round&#xD;
&#xD;
s with me, for instance, for an half-hour ?" con&#xD;
I timed the solemn gentleman very effectively, and&#xD;
appealing to the young lady. "It is claimed&#xD;
that it is useful and benefits some constitutions.&#xD;
Now I know of a poor young girl, sir, who at-&#xD;
tended dances to avoid nervous disease that she&#xD;
might work and pay her rent.  She afterward&#xD;
3 became aware of her error and refused to go any&#xD;
f more. And what is the result ? She is now in&#xD;
a comfortable hospital, and don't have to pay&#xD;
any rent at all. It leads to all sorts of wicked-&#xD;
less. Why, sir, take the case of Mrs. Fasher-&#xD;
lidge's own French maid i she ran away with her&#xD;
mistress' jewelry, and upon being detected,&#xD;
- stated that she had formerly been a coryphe at&#xD;
I the theatre. The pirouettes the poor girl had&#xD;
been forced to make had undoubtedly turned her&#xD;
head."&#xD;
Moses appeared to be so much affected by&#xD;
these impressive illustrations of the solemn gen-&#xD;
tleman's position, that the latter seemed inclined&#xD;
to relent, and said: " But there will probably be&#xD;
some games here, sir."&#xD;
"They are certainly a pleasant substitute,"&#xD;
suggested the young lady, who had been watch-&#xD;
ing Moses's countenance with some curiosity.&#xD;
Do yoc not think they arc interesting, sirO"&#xD;
"Delightful! It is so agreeable to renew our&#xD;
childhood for a merry hour. The old games of&#xD;
bu, and hunt the slipper, and thimble, and toot-&#xD;
leytoo-knock-em-down i" replied Moses vivacious-&#xD;
ly. " I revere them !"&#xD;
"Toot-young gentleman !" exclaimed the el-&#xD;
der at this in belialf our worthy hosts I protest&#xD;
against this idle mentioning of tootley and other&#xD;
senseless pastimes I&#xD;
" What did lie mean by games then? le cer-&#xD;
tainly can't mean cards !" wondered Moses. "I&#xD;
beg pardon the games youkmention, are not with&#xD;
-.-cards, arc they, sir ?" asked he, hesitatin.&#xD;
"Young man Iexclaimed the elder, exploding&#xD;
this time. "I pardon you for disrespect to me;&#xD;
but I will not, Sir, this insinuation at thme expense&#xD;
of the hono- and Christian decent of Mr and&#xD;
Mrs. Fasherlidge and I won't 1"&#xD;
" Oh! allow me to rectify his mistake," said&#xD;
the young lady, hastily interrupting the shocked&#xD;
and hiorror-stricken deacon, to address MosegQ.&#xD;
"6These games are Such as geographical puzzles,&#xD;
historical conundrums, and pleasant involutions&#xD;
of biblical knowledge, you know."&#xD;
" Oh! I sincerely beg the gentleman to forgive&#xD;
my stupidity. No disrespect, sir," replied Moses&#xD;
earnestly.&#xD;
" And these instructive exercises, as they&#xD;
should more properly be called," continued the&#xD;
mollified gentleman, "are also judiciously calcu-&#xD;
lated, sir, from thepositon in which we receive&#xD;
them, to strengthen the back as well as the&#xD;
memory, si"&#xD;
Moses was about cautiously replying when lie&#xD;
was interrupted by Mr. Toplady, who here en-&#xD;
tered the room.&#xD;
"Ah Moses! excuse me.   I thought I hiard&#xD;
your voice," said he. "I was in tho adjoininr&#xD;
library. I have been looking at the skulls."&#xD;
"The skulls ?" ejaculated Moses in a lively&#xD;
manner.&#xD;
" A very fine collection of tao line of hmeredit-&#xD;
ary chiefs of the Feejecs, sir," said the solemn&#xD;
gentlemn."Theywr bouht fro          iepe&#xD;

" Indeed !" exclaimed Moses.  (" Whew! what&#xD;
a way of raising the wind, and what a pres- af&#xD;
ent !")                                     th&#xD;
"The price was remarkably reasonable, Moses at&#xD;
-fifty cents a chief!" said Mr. Toplady.    re&#xD;
" If I had the collection," murmured Moses, "I R&#xD;

in two pieces," solo voce to his uncle, "and that ar&#xD;

"Yes, we had better go," said Mr. Toplady fii&#xD;
despondently.                               al&#xD;
pYou will not leave before the collation, sirs 911 n&#xD;
asked the deacon, with an air of profound aston- sf&#xD;
ishment. "It takes place at eleven.  Leaving a&#xD;
out of the question the splendid contributions to o&#xD;
the church plate, by which she has rendered her- v&#xD;
self so eminent, the munificent bounty of our w&#xD;
hostess is particularly evinced in her banquets, s&#xD;
sir. That admirable woman has been known to t(&#xD;
declare she would rather make the sacrifice of&#xD;
putting her children on one meal a day, and p&#xD;
stinting her husband to one suit annually, than s&#xD;
fail in either !"1&#xD;
" It is well known that she is a lady of great b&#xD;
liberality, refinement, and taste," said Mr. Top- t&#xD;
lady, feeling called upon to say something.&#xD;
"'Yes, sir," continued the deacon. "All these d&#xD;
may be observed in her personal attire alone. a&#xD;
Dr. Coddle has paid her the compliment of hav-&#xD;
ing done more to uphold the church, in the t&#xD;
simple matter of dressing, than any other member. i&#xD;
It vas a fortunate thing, both for him and the so- I&#xD;
ciety, when she became sincere. She became so, f&#xD;
sir, on listening to his powerful essay on the re-&#xD;
tributive nature of future punishment, at the(&#xD;
death of her uncle, who died unconfirmed in a fit t&#xD;
of apoplexy.  She was principally instrumental t&#xD;
in Dr. Coddle's succeeding the former divine, a&#xD;
very worthy but uninteresting man, sir.  You&#xD;
musvertinly stay to the banquet."  -&#xD;
M oses fell into a short reflection during these&#xD;
remarks. Regarding evening parties as a relaxa-&#xD;
tionhe had been wondering why, with so many&#xD;
of the usual appliances thereto eliminated in this&#xD;
case, Mrs. Fasherlidge should be fond of giv-&#xD;
incgthese affairs, and still more why they should&#xD;
be so well attended. A stern reflection upon the&#xD;
female weakness for social notoriety would have&#xD;
answered the one, and the last words of the dea-&#xD;
con'swremarks, perhaps, answered the other.&#xD;
Moses, however, more benevolently concluded&#xD;
that the simple, natural instinct for social inter-&#xD;
course and the pleasant interchange of thought,&#xD;
was a suffieilnt reason.&#xD;
"wThere will be nusic aiso," suggested a second&#xD;
young lady, looking pleasantly at the first. " You&#xD;
will certainly be repaid for your delay."&#xD;
"Ahi! that will be delightful. Now what opera&#xD;
'do you like best? I, for my part," cried Moses&#xD;
vivaciously, "have become enchanted with Doni-&#xD;
zetti's earlier works, and-"&#xD;
"Mis Wagbull, we all understand, possesses a&#xD;
cervice, and eminently adaptedl to sacred&#xD;
music, vice, To sacred music, sir l" said the dea-&#xD;
coni, brekn out again.&#xD;
con A then she will delight us. We must cer-&#xD;
tainly remain. - And perhaps she will sing your&#xD;

"I think not; I think not," interrupted the.&#xD;
flicted deacon. " It can hardly be expected, sir,&#xD;
at she or any other sane female desires to sing,&#xD;
this time and place, sir, any piece which makes&#xD;
ference to the forms and mummeries of the&#xD;
omish Church. That is, I should judge not!"&#xD;
Mr. Toplady felt compelled to draw off the in-&#xD;
amed elder from his incompatible nephew at once,&#xD;
nd the latter thus had an unrestrained oppor.&#xD;
unity of chatting with Miss Wagbull until the&#xD;
inclusion of the Syrian lecture, which was&#xD;
nished shortly afterward, much to the delight of&#xD;
ll who had listened to it. We will not give the&#xD;
ature of her remarks herv, but wv will *imply&#xD;
ay that they were so extremely pleasant, and her&#xD;
ppreciation of life therein seemed so akin to his&#xD;
wn, that he wished the moments of their inter-&#xD;
iew might have been prolonged. le saluted her&#xD;
ith unfeigned respect as she left upon being&#xD;
ummoned to assist in the proposed musical en-&#xD;
ertainment.&#xD;
Miss Stacy met him at the parlor door as he&#xD;
resently followers Miss Wagbull.  She hastily&#xD;
ought a private interview with him. Requested&#xD;
um to retire again to the library, conceal himself&#xD;
behind its door, and she would talk with him&#xD;
through the crack.&#xD;
"Through the crack ! But why this extraor-&#xD;
linary precaution, Miss Stacy?  W hy any secrecy&#xD;
t all in-"&#xD;
"Ila! A mpst singular rumor is current hero&#xD;
o-night," whispered she. "You will pardon me&#xD;
f I have taken these measures to promptly-&#xD;
but, hark! some one approaches! Adieu ! my dear&#xD;
friend. Do not follow me. Oh! do not, I beg!."&#xD;
With an alarmed look, she fled from him at&#xD;
once, ere she could explain to him the nature of&#xD;
the mysterious rumor, or the efficacy of the ex-&#xD;
traordinary measures she was evidently taking to&#xD;
suppress it.&#xD;
"It appears to be something connected with&#xD;
me! - he can't have discovered that am taken&#xD;
for a suspicious character in disguise, or have some&#xD;
infectious disease. What does she mean ? I'll&#xD;
ask uncle. By Jupiter ! there he is with that.&#xD;
Mrs. Crossboy. I can't go near him now."&#xD;
His attention was now engaged by the nusic,&#xD;
which was of a very interesting nature, beimg, in&#xD;
fact, a somewhat novel mixture of the more in-&#xD;
tricate choruses of sacred psalmody, and ballads&#xD;
respecting the Incheape Bell, Mr. John Anderson,&#xD;
the Sicur do Framboisy, and a few others similar-&#xD;
y popular for their solemnity, pathos, and re-&#xD;
spectability. He became particularly absorbed,&#xD;
however, in the vocal effort with which Miss Wag-&#xD;
bull endeavored to gratify the assemblage, and re-&#xD;
pay the kind hospitality of the mansion. There&#xD;
was something so sweet, in her expression,.and&#xD;
so dignified in her manner, that he felt as if it&#xD;
were St. Cecilia herself. What a pleasant, old-&#xD;
fashioned song, and what a voice! An octoge-&#xD;
narian near him, blew his nose in an extremely&#xD;
sonorous manner at its pathetic humor, and&#xD;
Moses himself felt a thrill of pleasure pass through&#xD;
his frame at those clear, earnest notes. His in-&#xD;
voluntary reverie,. and the silence of gratiticatioii&#xD;
which seemed to have. hushed every one in the&#xD;
room, was broken, finally, by a voice at his side.&#xD;
Great heaven ! it was that of his friend, Mrs,.&#xD;
Crossboy.&#xD;

MR. W&#xD;
"Ah Mr. Wink !" said she; "it is so pleasa&#xD;
to give sympathy instead of receiving it. I, wh&#xD;
have known both, can well say we have thus a&#xD;
the interesting excitement of bereavement, wit&#xD;
the acute pain left out. In conversing with you&#xD;
uncle, Mr. Topplehead-and an extremely aff&#xD;
ble creature he is too, I am sure-I learned b&#xD;
just now that you lost your maternal grandmother&#xD;
a year ago, and I-"&#xD;
I beg pardon, madam," replied Moses, with&#xD;
frown, "I feel that she is not quite lost to me-an&#xD;
none of my dear friends who have-and perm&#xD;
me to ask you how you liked the ballad whic&#xD;
the last young lady sung? Has she not a trul&#xD;
agreeable voice ?"&#xD;
Indeed she has, and what a beautiful figur&#xD;
she has, and what a sweet face, too," continue&#xD;
the loquacious lady.  By the way, does it no&#xD;
strike you, Mr. Wink, how lovely those feature&#xD;
would appear, were they-were they compose&#xD;
in the sad, quiet spirit of the tomb! Regar&#xD;
themMr. Wink, and apply the beautiful imagine&#xD;
ative thought .'Now as these features wer&#xD;
decidedly more calculated to arouse feelings con&#xD;
nected with a stay upon this earth, than a de&#xD;
parture from it, Moses not only did not apply th&#xD;
beautiful imaginative thought, but he expressed&#xD;
at once his absolute disapproval of any such pro&#xD;
ceeding by an unmistakable sniff of displeasure.&#xD;
Oh ! I am going home," said he. He arose,&#xD;
and taking a somewhat abrupt leave of the sorry&#xD;
Mrs. Crossboy, sought Miss Wagbull. While lin-&#xD;
gering in her presence, quite a number of heavy&#xD;
old ladies and aged gentlemen withdrew quietly&#xD;
and gradually from the room, and shortly after&#xD;
their exit the announcement of supper was gen-&#xD;
erally made. The universal buzz of gratification,&#xD;
which seemed to indicate that this was considered&#xD;
the event -of the evening by most of the guests,&#xD;
was succeeded by the approach to the banquet-&#xD;
room. Some lively attempts at velocity were&#xD;
made by the guests in this matter, and the stair-&#xD;
case was temporarily crowded with persons of&#xD;
both sexes, pleasantly undergoing the momentary&#xD;
torture of the pressure, with the bright hope be-&#xD;
fore them of being in time. One old lady, en-&#xD;
deavoring to take her dinner-pills on the route,&#xD;
would have been suffocated by wrongly swallow-&#xD;
ing them, had she not been fortunately restored&#xD;
by the shoves and blows upon her back incident&#xD;
to her position. Another guest, an elderly gen-&#xD;
tleman, most singularly lost his set of teeth dur.&#xD;
ing the passage, but otherwise it was safely ac-&#xD;
complished by the majority of the guests. As&#xD;
Miss Wagbul declined to follow them, Moses ac-&#xD;
companied her to her carriage, and then returned&#xD;
to seek his uncle, who had evidently been carried&#xD;
under pressure to the supper-room. It was with,&#xD;
some difficulty that he could obtain entrance&#xD;
thereto. The noise of indiscriminate conversa-&#xD;
tion, and of the numerous acts of refreshment&#xD;
and commands to the waiters, arose in mingled&#xD;
strength.  Several gentlemen appeared to be&#xD;
without hope of reaching the table. The solemn&#xD;
gentleman or deacon with whom he had con-&#xD;
versed in the library, in particular, excited Moses's&#xD;
sympathies by the fr-antic efforts which he now&#xD;
made to find a place thereat. Hie pushed about&#xD;
from one part of the table to another, now futilely&#xD;
attempting to reach over the heads of his luckier&#xD;
anid regardless friends, and now attempting in&#xD;
vain to crowd himself in between them. " Fo-&#xD;
&#xD;
nt heaven's sake, sir," said he, with symptoms of&#xD;
1o plucking his hair, and making quite a moving ap.&#xD;
ill peal to Moses, "assist me. Get me a place at the&#xD;
th table, for God's sake! That is-excuse me-but&#xD;
ir -O   dear !-I shall not succeed if some one&#xD;
a- doesn't help me."  His despair was very touch-&#xD;
it ing, but Moses was forced to inform  him lie&#xD;
er evidently could not bd assisted.&#xD;
" There is that missionary cannibal, young&#xD;
a Witling, standing next to the hostess !" cried the&#xD;
d deacon in his bitterness; " and that conceited&#xD;
it coxcomb, Coddle, oin the other side. 0 dear !&#xD;
h she is absolutely assisting them herself, and giv-&#xD;
y ing them all the choice dishes I Sir, age is not&#xD;
respected nowadays. The respect due to years&#xD;
e and the rights of elderly experience and respect-&#xD;
d ability is thrown away and basely trampled upon,&#xD;
t sir!"&#xD;
S    "Calm yourself, sir," replied Moses. "It was&#xD;
d perhaps, by some over sight that you have been so&#xD;
d unfortunately neglected.&#xD;
-   "Oversight! no, sir. It was a deliberate in-&#xD;
e sult, sir; a calm, cool, deliberate insult upon the&#xD;
- part of Mr. and Mrs. Fasherlidge. But I will&#xD;
- thwart it, I will, by heaven !" concluded he, mak-&#xD;
e ing a convulsive grab at a waiter who was push-&#xD;
1 ing by. Here an opening was made in the crowd&#xD;
-at the table, by a gentleman retiring with a plate&#xD;
in his hand, who proposed seeking. a secret cor-&#xD;
ner to lubricate his repast from a private pocket-&#xD;
flask which lie ingeniously practiced carrying to&#xD;
temperance festivities. The deacon disappeared&#xD;
in the chasm. Moses now descried his uncle upon&#xD;
the other side of the room, wedged in by the&#xD;
side of Mrs. Crossboy, to whose vivacious anec-&#xD;
dotes the unhappy gentleman appeared to be&#xD;
listening with a mingled expression of ferocity&#xD;
and despair upon his countenance. His friend&#xD;
Miss Stacy, too, he observed in another corner&#xD;
alone, unhelped, and helpless. In his courteous&#xD;
benevolence he at once started to assist her in&#xD;
her lonely distress, when a slight occurrence took&#xD;
place, which rendered his retirement perhaps un-&#xD;
avoidable. The unfortunate deacon had not suc-&#xD;
ceeded after all in reaching the table, and in his&#xD;
frenzy had attempted the forcible expulsion of&#xD;
one of the guests therefrom. A gentle alterca-&#xD;
tion took place between the forgetful contestants,&#xD;
and in the momentary consternation of the as-&#xD;
sembly, Moses received a cup of chocolate in his&#xD;
bosom, and concluding his efforts in behalf of&#xD;
his fair friend Miss Stacy would be unavailing lie&#xD;
left the room. He was shortly joined by his uncle.&#xD;
"I am glad you are here," said that gen-&#xD;
tlemai, in nervous agitation. "By heaven   -&#xD;
escaped from her-that old woman with her talk&#xD;
about death and scythes ! Let us go, Moses, or&#xD;
she will be on us again. Let us go at once."&#xD;
"Certainly," replied Moses.&#xD;
"But you-you have enjoyed yourself to-night&#xD;
haven't you, Moses ?" asked Mr. Toplady hesitat-&#xD;
ingly, when they were seated in the carriage.&#xD;
"Oh ! yes," replied Moses, remembering Miss&#xD;
Wagbull. "It has been pleasant to ine. Indeed&#xD;
very pleasant."&#xD;
"Well, leaving out the old woman with the&#xD;
scythe, and the lengthiness of the lecture, the&#xD;
occupation of the host and hostess' time, our un-&#xD;
acquaintance with most of the guests, this dread-.&#xD;
lul crowd at supper, and our desire to be a little&#xD;
more lively, ehi? perhaps it was," said Mr. Toplady&#xD;
retrospectively. " Eh, Moses, perhaps it was ?"&#xD;

&#xD;
"iDo 'you suspeet me," cried Moses, "of being&#xD;
a purloiner of-"&#xD;
Your game of mistaking numbers was ver&#xD;
pretty, but it won't do, it won't do," continue&#xD;
the old gentleman.' " My blood is up, by heaven&#xD;
and I will have the twenty - eight mats bac&#xD;
again, and additional vengeance for the hours of&#xD;
patient watching for you which it has cost me !"&#xD;
" But-my dear sir, won't you listen to me?&#xD;
exclaimed Moses, in utter astonishment and dis&#xD;
gust.&#xD;
"No, sir, I will not, at least until the police&#xD;
man arrives. Prepare for at least five years it&#xD;
the penitentiary. If you are so fond of the mats&#xD;
I'll see they put you to making them in the insti&#xD;
tuition, ha!ha!"&#xD;
"Take this hideous envelope from me. Re-&#xD;
lease me from this indignity. Release me, or-&#xD;
send your family out of the room," continued&#xD;
Moses nervously, as lie caught sight of the young&#xD;
ladies, irrepressibly tittering at the singular ap-&#xD;
pearance he presented.&#xD;
"No, sir, I shall not endanger the peace and&#xD;
mats of society by any such proceeding, I assure&#xD;
you !&#xD;
"But listen to me a moment," begged Moses.&#xD;
"I can easily explain how-if you will release&#xD;
me; I have papers upon my person to show&#xD;
you-"&#xD;
"Be quiet, sir. Be quiet until the police arrive&#xD;
and you will have an opportunity !" said the o14&#xD;
gentleman, cotinuin- his satirical air of benev,&#xD;
olence.o&#xD;
Moses endeavored to compose himself to si-&#xD;
lence, but in vain.&#xD;
"Under these circumstances, in placing an&#xD;
estimate upon your character, I am called upon&#xD;
to read you," exclaimed he, with renewed em-&#xD;
piis"to regard you as a contemptible fellow&#xD;
and unreasonable muff, unreasonable muff, sir."&#xD;
thEh, sir, what is that you said?  What is&#xD;
that, Sir ?" asked the old gentleman, jumping in-&#xD;
stinctively to the rear of the cook, as he ob-&#xD;
served Moses's threatening aspect.&#xD;
I say, si-, that I consider you simply as a&#xD;
muff; and were I possessed of the use of my&#xD;
limbs, sir, I should he compelled to inflict per-&#xD;
sonal chastisement upon you, sir, in this very&#xD;
apartment. I would, I assure you !" -&#xD;
0 dear !" cried the ladies, pulling back their&#xD;
relative in bodily fear, and Cyeing Moses with&#xD;
terror.&#xD;
"Ibeg your pardon, ladies," cried the latter,&#xD;
with immediate regret, " that I have so far for,&#xD;
gotten your presence and your connection with&#xD;
this gentleman, as to have uttered words disre-&#xD;
speetfnl of either. I will now await the arrival&#xD;
of the authorities."&#xD;
After an half-hour's lapse, during which Moses,&#xD;
in dignified silence and with averted gaze, en-&#xD;
deavored to dissipate his sense of injured self-&#xD;
respect, by reverting to the happy scenes of his&#xD;
childhood, the policeman came, and the mistake&#xD;
of the old gentleman was shown beyond doubt&#xD;
by the proofs of respectability which Moses had&#xD;
upon his person.  The policeman was sent away&#xD;
by the old gentleman, and the latter, after&#xD;
staring t Moses confusedly for some moments,&#xD;
" My God ! sir, this is a dreadful affisir," said&#xD;
he. "I apologize. I didn't like to do it out&#xD;
there. Stay and spend the evening. I have&#xD;
&#xD;
g Burgundy aid Mumm in my cellar. I just had&#xD;
up a second bottle, and am glad you come. We'll&#xD;
y make a night of it. You and I will watch together&#xD;
d for the thieves, and-"&#xD;
,   " Oh ! no; no, sir. I beg of you, excuse me,"&#xD;
k replied Moses hastily.&#xD;
"Eh?   Perhaps you still feel a little aggrieved&#xD;
and want further reparation," said the pater&#xD;
familias dubiously. "It's natural, and if you&#xD;
say so, I'll have John stand at the front-door as&#xD;
you go out, and you can kick him down-stairs."&#xD;
-Moses felt himself forced to decline this hand-&#xD;
some offer.&#xD;
" Then you will call again ?" said the old gen-&#xD;
- tleman, following Moses out into the parlor. "My&#xD;
wife and daughters will be happy to see you&#xD;
again !"&#xD;
"Oh! do, sir !" chimed in the young ladies, en-&#xD;
deavoring to look tenderly at Moses, though they&#xD;
suddenly tittered again, in spite of their wishes.&#xD;
- Moses started nervously, and with a profit-&#xD;
sion of hasty thanks bowed himself immediately&#xD;
into the street. There he observed the policeman&#xD;
sustaining himself by the front railings and labor-&#xD;
ing very heavily in laughter.  Moses rushed by&#xD;
him and proceeded rapidly to his hotel. He re-&#xD;
tired at once to his room, and spent the remainder&#xD;
of the evening in committing the event in cipher&#xD;
to his diary, and in reading Rasselas in bed.&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
AN ENTIRELY UNEXPEcTED EVENT IN TOPLADY's&#xD;
LIFE, WITH AN EQUALLY UNEXPECTED TERMINA-&#xD;
TION.&#xD;
TnE slight incident related in the previous&#xD;
chapter was, after all, so really amusing, so in-&#xD;
structive of the curious predicaments in which&#xD;
the most respectable of human beings may be&#xD;
placed by the stupidity of New-Yorkers, that&#xD;
Moses confided it to his uncle.&#xD;
Very amusing, indeed ; but does it not seem,&#xD;
Moses, responded the latter with asslight frown,&#xD;
"somewhat singular that in the short space of&#xD;
time you have been here, you should have been&#xD;
already twice in difficulty-in fact, in contact with&#xD;
the police !"&#xD;
"But, my dear uncle," replied Moses warmly,&#xD;
"I am sure in both cases it was totally unappre-&#xD;
hended by me, and-"&#xD;
" Yes, very true. But what I would particu-&#xD;
larly refer to, Moses, is a certain want of circum-&#xD;
spection in placing yourself within reach of such&#xD;
events," continued Mr. Toplady, with an air of&#xD;
partial sternness. "Look at me; have I ever&#xD;
been subject to suspicion or-"&#xD;
The abrupt entrance of two strangers inter-&#xD;
rupted his well-meant lecture.&#xD;
"This here is Mr. E. Toplady's apartment,&#xD;
an't it ?" inquired one.&#xD;
"Yes, sir, it is ?" replied the uncle severely.&#xD;
"Oh ! I suppose he is out, an't he ?" suggested&#xD;
the intruder with a trivial air.&#xD;
"No sir, le isnot. I mthat person and-"&#xD;
You can go peacefully with mc, No. 048, patrol&#xD;
man, to the station, or I can shove you !"&#xD;

18                       MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
'What! Good heavenI This is a-mistake!&#xD;
There is some-'? -&#xD;
" Certainly, there always is, isn't there, 390 ?"&#xD;
said the officer dryly to the other. "But be kind&#xD;
enough to get your hat. You may take, if you&#xD;
want to, a clean shirt and two pairs of socks in&#xD;
your pocket."&#xD;
" But what do you mean? ,What is it for 9"&#xD;
exclaimed the astonished Mr. Toplady..&#xD;
"Oblige me by sayin' nothin' more. My du-&#xD;
ties is simply to arrest you," replied the police-&#xD;
man. "I han't any orders to tell you any thing."-&#xD;
"Show your warrant! show your warrant I"&#xD;
cried Moses, overwhelmed with surprise and con-&#xD;
cern. " Until you do that, my friend will not&#xD;
leave this apartment, if I can help it, by heaven !"&#xD;
"Young man, I jest advise you not to meddle&#xD;
in this here.  You'd better not attempt any&#xD;
rescue." And with these words the officer rubbed&#xD;
his nose with his club in dry humor, and its sig-&#xD;
nificance appeared also to divert his companion&#xD;
very much.I&#xD;
" What is it? Confound it, there is some mis-&#xD;
take here, men! I don't remember.any thing I've&#xD;
done lately !" again exclaimed Mr. Toplady, who&#xD;
in the momentary confusion was unable to remem-&#xD;
her any of his own, or any one else's acts, for&#xD;
that matter.&#xD;
"This is surprising," cried Moses. "Police-&#xD;
men, you are at least bound to inform him of the&#xD;
cause of this outrage, for such it assuredly is V"&#xD;
"Look here,-I can't wait here no longer," ex-&#xD;
claimed the officer. "You can hear all about it&#xD;
of the inspector. I don't know nothing about&#xD;
charges any how."&#xD;
"Well, then, we had better wait until we reach&#xD;
the station-house," said the prisoner hurriedly.&#xD;
" It's probably a gross mistake, which will be&#xD;
cleared up there instantly !"&#xD;
" What ! will you coolly submit to these fel-&#xD;
lows ?" renewed Moses, looking pugnaciously at&#xD;
the officers. And he, no doubt, would have con-&#xD;
tinued his reckless opposition to the guardians&#xD;
a'nd been presently knocked down by them, had he&#xD;
not ascertained from his uncle that the police were&#xD;
duly authorized by general warrant to proceed in&#xD;
this manner.&#xD;
"Well, then, if- you go I will go with yop,&#xD;
uncle. I'll accompany you and stay there with&#xD;
you," said the affectionate nephew. "In the tn-&#xD;
pleasantness and gloom'of the dungeon I can,&#xD;
perhaps, soothe the distressed-"&#xD;
Mr. Toplady had been gazing for a moment at&#xD;
the officer. He possessed a great knowledge of the&#xD;
ways of human nature-male, at least-and he&#xD;
seemed struck with an idea, for a light passed&#xD;
over his face.&#xD;
" Eh ?  No.  I think you had better not&#xD;
Moses," said he. "I had better go alone, hadn'&#xD;
I, officer?"&#xD;
"I've got a cab out here. It won't hold bu&#xD;
two. 390, Jim, can show t'other gentleman th&#xD;
way to the station-house, if he wants to go,'&#xD;
replied the officer, becoming quite affable.&#xD;
Moses concluded to agree to the arrangement&#xD;
Ilis unfortunate uncle was conveyed quietly t&#xD;
the cab, and he himself at once tore along with th&#xD;
auxiliary officer in eager haste to the polic&#xD;
office.         . .&#xD;
To his great astonishment, and certainly to hi&#xD;
profound gratification at its cause, upon reachmn&#xD;
that place he discovered considerable excitemen&#xD;
&#xD;
The officer' who had taken  charge of hils uncle&#xD;
had already arrivedbut the latter had notu!&#xD;
In their disappointment the authorities sternly&#xD;
held Moses in the suspicious light of a -conniver&#xD;
at the escape. All knowledge of the official&#xD;
charges brought against his uncle, and of the case&#xD;
in general, was thus unfortunately ordered to be&#xD;
refused him by the entire force. He was allowed&#xD;
to leave the premises, as the officers who had&#xD;
been detailed to make the arrest freed him from&#xD;
any blame in the matter, as far as their know-&#xD;
ledge was concerned. And he was thus left to&#xD;
find out as best he could what the occurrence had&#xD;
been which had given rise to these disagreeable&#xD;
proceedings against his relative, and also to what&#xD;
obscure retreat that relative had fled under these&#xD;
unpleasant circumstances.&#xD;
CIIAPTER VII.&#xD;
MISS STACY INCREASES HER INTEREST IN oUR-HERO.&#xD;
MosEs endeavored in vain to allay his natural&#xD;
concern respecting the whereabouts of his uncle&#xD;
and the probably doubtful condition of spirits&#xD;
under the oppressive circumstances in which&#xD;
the latter was placed. For a day or two, all&#xD;
his cautious efforts appeared fruitless, and his&#xD;
own spirits were beginning to be exceedingly&#xD;
depressed by the forced secrecy imposed up-&#xD;
on him in the matter, when he received a&#xD;
note evidently written by the absconding party&#xD;
himself, in which he was partially -relieved&#xD;
from his anxiety, and from further prosecution&#xD;
of his search, by a statement therein of his re-&#xD;
lative's satisfaction at the immediate situation,&#xD;
and by a desire that he should not attempt&#xD;
to jeopardize the same by any present efforts&#xD;
at discovery.  In the mean tine the society&#xD;
of his several new-made acquaintances in a&#xD;
measure dispelled our hero's disappointment at&#xD;
his uncle's necessary absence.&#xD;
Miss Stacy in particular appearedmore assid-&#xD;
uous than ever in her affability, and she took this&#xD;
opportunity of expressing her warm interest in&#xD;
his designs. lIe made a morning call at her parlor&#xD;
in obedience to her summons.  Sh was charm-&#xD;
ingly attired in a short dress of white camnbric&#xD;
vith pantalettes, slippers, and blue ribbons cross-&#xD;
Ing openwork stockings, and her arms were&#xD;
partially covered with mits. The gallant Moses&#xD;
was a little surprised at first by this picturesque&#xD;
costume, but soon learned that she was about&#xD;
1 making her customary visit to a portrait painter's&#xD;
'studio 0who had been intermittingly engaged for&#xD;
the last five or six years in taking her as Inno-&#xD;
t eence.&#xD;
" Ach Mr. Winkfield!" said she impulsively, as&#xD;
t -our hero commenced to taper off in his compli-&#xD;
e ments at her charming personation,   You are&#xD;
so noble, so generous, that one formed with a&#xD;
heart constitutionally impulsive as mine, can not&#xD;
refrain from a wish to assist you in all your re-&#xD;
o solves, and I would particularly proffer now to&#xD;
e guide you, to cherish your interests, and ever to-"&#xD;
e    "Mv   dear Miss Stacy," interrupted Moses,&#xD;
hardly find words to express my wish to return&#xD;
g this instance of your friendship.'**    f l&#xD;
t. "Ah ! ever true to the nobler instincts of tile&#xD;
&#xD;
heart.- You feel, do you not," continued she in&#xD;
tender inquiry, "that you would hereafter scarcely&#xD;
hazard plunging alone into the turbid sea of the&#xD;
life about us ?"&#xD;
"Certainly, oh! no. That is, oh! yes, I mean.&#xD;
I feel in a measure the danger which you speak&#xD;
of," replied Moses.&#xD;
"As you were! Quick, quick !" exclaimed&#xD;
she suddenly. "Look at that fly upon the wall&#xD;
once more."&#xD;
"At the fly?" repeated Moses, in surprise.&#xD;
"Yes, yes, I would catch again that noble pen-&#xD;
sive expression, which for a moment was then&#xD;
arrested upon your countenance. Ai! yes, the&#xD;
life and loves f that innocent being, cheerily&#xD;
playing in blissful unconsciousness in the sunshine&#xD;
the livelong day, I know suggest deep emotional&#xD;
thought. Soon rudely torni fiom the dear partner&#xD;
of his daily joy, by the dastard spider, great&#xD;
griefs will assail him. With a yell of despair, he&#xD;
dies. Ah! thus it is with human life. But to&#xD;
proceed," continued the fair lady, and she here-&#xD;
upon placed herself upon an ottoman near Moses's&#xD;
feet in a most girlish attitude with a sampler, at&#xD;
which graceful posturing Moses was affected to&#xD;
making a compliment.&#xD;
"Naughty, naugity man!" continued the fair&#xD;
being naively pouting, and presently she playfully&#xD;
ran her needle into his leg. lie concealed the&#xD;
short utterance of personal anguish which he&#xD;
would like to have made at this, and she continued.&#xD;
" But to proceed-in the turbid sea of life, dear&#xD;
friend, you would feel, would you not, the need&#xD;
of woman's aid to sustain you, to buoy you up&#xD;
as you buffet the waves ?"&#xD;
"Above all things, I should be happy to&#xD;
secure that," exclaimed Moses courteously, al-&#xD;
thoughl he did not exactly see how woman's aid&#xD;
was usually necessary in natatory experiments.&#xD;
"At the party the other evening, as you are&#xD;
aware, I promptly suppressed allusions to certain&#xD;
relations existing between us. Bmut here between&#xD;
us alone, I now feel that I may confidingly&#xD;
promise you my fiendship," continued his fair&#xD;
friend, picking coyly at her sampler.  " And&#xD;
when your plans are more definitely formed, you&#xD;
will let mie know them, first of all?"&#xD;
" Oh! yes; ipost heartily. I am proud of the&#xD;
opportunity," replied our hero gallantly kissing&#xD;
her mit as he rose to leave.&#xD;
"Oh1 adieu !" said she, tripping gracefully&#xD;
toward an inner roon as lie left the door.&#xD;
" Adieu, mon amni!"  And she archly wafted a&#xD;
kiss toward him upon her taper fore-fimger.&#xD;
"What a kind woman! and charming, I am&#xD;
sure," thought Moses, as he walked down the hall&#xD;
from her parlor. " What warm friendship!"&#xD;
How in vain did he further speculate upon the&#xD;
means of repaying that warm friendship, when&#xD;
lie found her maid at his door that afternoon!&#xD;
"I beg pardon, Mr.-Winkfield, but Miss Stacy's&#xD;
compliments, and she wishes to know if I can be&#xD;
of any service to you in mending your clothes,&#xD;
sir, and examining your linen when it's returned&#xD;
from the wash,"&#xD;
" Eh? God bless me! I will not trouble you,&#xD;
my dear; oh ! no, there is no necessity."&#xD;
"But Miss Stacy wishes ue," said the smiling&#xD;
maid.&#xD;
"0O dear ! but tell your mistress, Annie, that I am&#xD;
ceeedingly indebted to 11cr for 11cr kindness, and&#xD;
indeed I am to you too, Annie. There !" re-&#xD;
&#xD;
L sponded Mose6, placing something in her hand.&#xD;
"You are a good girl; not now, but when I feel&#xD;
the need I will certainly  avail myself of your&#xD;
needle P'&#xD;
CHAPTER     VIII.&#xD;
MR. WINm1i-ELD ATTENDS AN INTERESTING MEETING&#xD;
OF AN EMINENT CONSERVATIVE SOCIETY&#xD;
Two or three days after his uncle's departure&#xD;
Moses was finishing in the hotel reading-roonte&#xD;
advertisements of the last journal of themmom-mmig&#xD;
and casually looking out upon the mu ggyatn ios&#xD;
phere and slippery pavements to regard them as&#xD;
an actual preventive against rash adventure in&#xD;
the streets, when he happened to observe a Inotico&#xD;
of the meeting of a society entitled "TThe Nation-&#xD;
al Society of Political Instruction." Struck by&#xD;
the name, he was about making inquiries of the&#xD;
attendant who was noiselessly arranging the&#xD;
newspapers upon the table, when a gentlemnan&#xD;
near by gave him  the desired information, and&#xD;
added that he was himself a member of the asso-&#xD;
ciation.&#xD;
" We have our semni-annual to-day, sir, and&#xD;
some extremely important    measures will be&#xD;
brought ip for decision. I suppose that the so-&#xD;
ciety is now in session, sir."&#xD;
Moses intimated that if it was of a public na-&#xD;
ture lie would like extremely to attend it, and tlim&#xD;
gentleman  in reply immediately proffered his&#xD;
services as chaperon.  Moses knew that this gen-&#xD;
tiemnan was somewhat noted in public circles, md&#xD;
was frequently called upon to iead subscription&#xD;
committees for charity balls or for benefits to&#xD;
decayed tragedians; and upon the way, the Hon.&#xD;
Luke Noblock, for that was his nami, gave our&#xD;
hero much useful public information.&#xD;
"-Our society is strictly conservative, sir," said&#xD;
11e to oumr hero in explaining the objects of the&#xD;
association in question.&#xD;
" Al ! yes.  In medio res tulisslonus)" replied&#xD;
Moses, applauding the position.&#xD;
" We hold the true meaning of the word con-&#xD;
servative, sir," continued the gentleman, " to be&#xD;
to earefumlly avoid exercising any influence u on&#xD;
any body or any thimg "&#xD;
" But, dear me ! I should hardly think the form-&#xD;
ation of a society necessary to acconmplish tlhat&#xD;
purpose," replied the somewhat surprised Moses.&#xD;
"I mean ini- our owi affairs-in affairs with&#xD;
which we have any natural relation, or which in&#xD;
any way can possibly affect us, internally, domes-&#xD;
tically, or nationally.&#xD;
" But in what way, then, does the society mani-&#xD;
fest its usefulness ?" asked Moses curiously.&#xD;
By its formal sanctions of general govern-&#xD;
mental and ethical principles, and by its sugges-&#xD;
tions of improvement to foreign nations ! In this&#xD;
way we occupy ourselves, doing much good with-&#xD;
out doing any mischief. In this way have we ac-&#xD;
quired our fame, and we are widely known, sir,&#xD;
both individually'and collectively !"&#xD;
" Ai! I see," said Moses, apparently relieved.&#xD;
You must be."&#xD;
" The .radicals call us idiotic," continued Mr.&#xD;
Noblock, "aand the society is frequently charac-&#xD;
terized by the public as imlbecile; bumt we well&#xD;
kmnow such terms arec but tme mecre results of envy&#xD;
or ignlorance of our glorious position of comnserva-&#xD;
tisnm !"&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD.                    19&#xD;

20                        MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
And as an instance of. this"conservatism,&#xD;
which appeared rather elastic, he stated that, in&#xD;
the case of the local politics of the city, in-&#xD;
stead of foolishly attempting the impossible task&#xD;
of eradicating the system of wire-working, how-&#xD;
ever objectionable it was, it quietly entered into&#xD;
the various cliques and vigorously intrigued itself.&#xD;
" At the last election, I was appointed, to-&#xD;
gether with three other members, by the society,&#xD;
to secure the nomination as controller for Pro-&#xD;
fessor Quanler, our greatest abstractionist in po-&#xD;
litical economy and successful refuter of Malthus,&#xD;
both theoretically and practically.  I mention&#xD;
this, and the fact of our obtaining admission to&#xD;
the municipal convention with the expenditure&#xD;
by the society of fifteen hundred dollars, bor-&#xD;
rowed from Professor Quattler's aunt, to show&#xD;
you its real energy.".&#xD;
"And your candidate succeeded in obtaining&#xD;
the desired nomination ?" inquired Moses.&#xD;
" Well-no,"replied the other slowly. "Though&#xD;
the day before the ballot we obtained the pro-&#xD;
mises of more than two thirds of the whole con-&#xD;
vention, and on an informal vote obtained a fine&#xD;
majority, for some reason or other, when the for-&#xD;
mal vote was taken, our candidate didn't obtain&#xD;
but four votes-not another one beside our own!&#xD;
There was something wrong somewhere !"&#xD;
Moses agreed that it was really mysterious.&#xD;
They had now reached the place of meeting of the&#xD;
society, the Apollo Hall, a large apartment over&#xD;
a stable and carriage repository in Mercer street.&#xD;
A sample of the usual noise attendant upon de-&#xD;
liberative assemblies was issuing from the hall,&#xD;
at one end of'which was a deep stage, occupied&#xD;
in the rear by a pile &amp;amp;f neglected music-stands,&#xD;
the rest being devoted to the officers of the meet-&#xD;
ing. As there were of these, beside the presi-&#xD;
dent, a large number of vice-presidents and se-&#xD;
cretaries, it was well filled, especially as its occu-&#xD;
pants were temporarily enlarged somewhat be-&#xD;
yond their natural dimensions by the importance&#xD;
of their position. The members who were not&#xD;
officers were trying to look important also, by&#xD;
earnestly listening to a gentleman with gold spec.&#xD;
tacles who had the floor, and of whose remarks&#xD;
many of them were taking notes.&#xD;
Ah ! that is Professor Quattler himself !"&#xD;
whispered Mr. Noblock, as they took a seat in&#xD;
the body of the house. "I see he is remarking&#xD;
upon the causes of war again, and has just al-&#xD;
luded to the celebrated treatise of Van Botheid&#xD;
on the Perturbations of the Planets in connection&#xD;
therewith. He translated the original two hun-&#xD;
dred and fifty pages himself, and he added thir-&#xD;
teen hundred pages more of valuable editorial&#xD;
notes. The edition is regarded, sir, as one of&#xD;
the most extraordinary contributions to science&#xD;
of this age."&#xD;
Moses did not express any opinion on this, as&#xD;
he had never before heard of it Nor did he&#xD;
know that such was the profound erudition there-&#xD;
in displayed, it was believed only one man had&#xD;
ever successfully mastered it, to whom a singular&#xD;
experience occurred.  The, original "perturba-&#xD;
tions" got into this persevering fellow's brains,&#xD;
and the doctors gave him -up as incurabIe But&#xD;
as he proceeded wildly to read the notes, he re-&#xD;
covered, His brain being partly turned by the&#xD;
text, the notes had the effect of turning them en-&#xD;
tirely round to their original position.&#xD;
.Professor Quattler's remarks were presently In-&#xD;
&#xD;
terrupted by the pell-mell'return of committee&#xD;
of the society from their committee-room to re-&#xD;
port progress. The chairman thereof stated that&#xD;
"the committee for universal peace and settle-&#xD;
ment of disputes by arbitration" had sat long upon&#xD;
the subject of the resolutions referred to them,&#xD;
and had hoped to shape their ends (sensation) to&#xD;
meet the approval of the society, but they were&#xD;
totally unable to agree upon what the proposed&#xD;
Address to all Nations should be, and asked to&#xD;
be discharged.  At the prompt suggestion of&#xD;
Professor Quattler, the society would not listen&#xD;
to the unhappy committee's wishes, and peremp-&#xD;
torily ordered them to return to their committee-&#xD;
room. The professor then resumed, the thread&#xD;
of his remarks, and proceeded for an hour or&#xD;
so in a discourse which became so impressive&#xD;
that before he had half finished the president&#xD;
shut his eyes to meditate thereon, and nods of&#xD;
approval might be seen all over the house. le&#xD;
would probably have proceeded for an hour lon-&#xD;
ger, had he not been again interrupted by the&#xD;
peace committee. Such a noise emanated from&#xD;
its room that three quarters of the society awoke&#xD;
and sought the passage-way, in curiosity to as-&#xD;
certain the cause. The committee conscious of&#xD;
its inability to come to any agreement, had very&#xD;
incongruously resorted to physical force to set-&#xD;
tle the question of the Peace Address under its&#xD;
consideration, and one old gentleman had been&#xD;
knocked into such an extremely insensible con-&#xD;
dition as to lead to the belief in the minds of&#xD;
many that a slung shot was used during the me-&#xD;
ee. Order was presently restored, both in the&#xD;
committee-room and the hall, by the final dis-&#xD;
charge of the unhappy committee, and as Pro-&#xD;
fessor Quattiler's planetary ideas had been irre-&#xD;
vokably driven from his head by the interrup-&#xD;
tions, the president ordered the treasurer of the&#xD;
society to read his-report.  Thereupon Profes-&#xD;
sor Quattler rose again and expressed his will-&#xD;
ingness to relieve the treasurer from the trouble&#xD;
by reading it himself.  The society having re-&#xD;
ceived by the report the agreeable intelligence&#xD;
that they were heavily in debt, then-..proceeded&#xD;
to the appointment of several more committees&#xD;
on various subjects, upon all of which Professor&#xD;
Quattler expressed a desire to serve. In fact, in&#xD;
his incorrigible desire to play all the parts, he&#xD;
strongly resembled the illustrious Nick Bottom.&#xD;
These committees occupying most of the time&#xD;
till noon, a recess in the proceedings was taken,&#xD;
and although the announcement by the presi-&#xD;
dent that there would be no refection as usual,&#xD;
appeared to cause a momentary rage and disap-&#xD;
p4ontment in the hearts of many members pres-&#xD;
ent, they endeavored to make the recess as lively&#xD;
as they could with the spiritual refreshment of&#xD;
unofficial conversation. In this way Moses was&#xD;
enabled to hear many pleasing facts and anec-&#xD;
dotes connected with the objects and influence&#xD;
of the society.&#xD;
" Ha ! ha! Professor, you saw that last thing of&#xD;
Palmerston's," said a lean gentleman to Profes-&#xD;
sor Quattler, "That was meant as a dab at us ,&#xD;
Pretty good! wasn't it -"&#xD;
"Yes, yes," said the professor, much amused.&#xD;
" By the way, I have heard also that the Queen&#xD;
isafi-aid that the society will take it seriously, and&#xD;
has remonstrated with the premier against a repe-&#xD;
tition of bon mots on us. ,I see Greenlog is not&#xD;
here to-day. I didn't exactly like his argument&#xD;
&#xD;
in his closing prayer at the last meeting about in&#xD;
ternational comity," continued he after a pause.&#xD;
" The doctor is apt to be crude in his opinion&#xD;
and loose in his statements."&#xD;
" It was a fine prayer, though ; one of the finest&#xD;
prayers ever offered to the society, I think,'&#xD;
said the other warmly.,&#xD;
- "You have seen his new work on inythology,&#xD;
professor?  Ought we to do any thing about his&#xD;
secretly worshiping Jupiter?9" continued the lean&#xD;
gentleman. "They say that some of his students&#xD;
have caught him a half-dozen times going through&#xD;
with the regular ceremonials in the Greek room&#xD;
of the college, and it has got to be a regular thing.&#xD;
It is rather radical, isn't it?"&#xD;
" No, sir. It is a splendid example of conserv-&#xD;
atism. It is certainly an older religion than the&#xD;
Christian, and I think we had better do nothing.&#xD;
If it is necessary, however, I will attend to it."&#xD;
. " Certainly, certainly; I suggested it to you for&#xD;
that purpose," said the other submissively.&#xD;
"Gentlemen," said another person, who had&#xD;
just joined the two, "gentlemen, I want your&#xD;
advice, What do you think of the propriety of&#xD;
a secret resolution deprecating the evident in-&#xD;
tentions of Austria toward Italy, to be privately&#xD;
-passed by the society and quietly handed to Na-&#xD;
poleon by Dayton after dinner ?"&#xD;
"A  good thing, Mr. Small," said Professor&#xD;
Quattler. "I have already been thinking of that&#xD;
thing myself."&#xD;
"You have ?" said Mr. Small.&#xD;
"Yes, I shall introduce the resolution this af-&#xD;
ternoon: whether viewed as an encouragement to&#xD;
Napoleon or a warning to Austria, its effect must&#xD;
be propitiously felt."&#xD;
" Ha ! ha !" said the unfortunate initiator of the&#xD;
proposed movement in hysterical fury, walking&#xD;
away.&#xD;
" By the way, Mason, you have not heard of&#xD;
that rich particular of Francis Joseph's cabinet&#xD;
consultation on Napoleon's letter to him,"contin-&#xD;
ued the professor.  "It is known only to a few.&#xD;
I got it directly from Motley,-who was in Vienna&#xD;
at the time. He's a hot-tempered little fellow-&#xD;
his flinging bis crown at Esterhazy showed that-&#xD;
but at bottom full of fine instincts. You know&#xD;
Connt Krug, his minister of finance, is extremely&#xD;
fat; and upon his stating to his master that he&#xD;
couldn't raise a kreutzer from his subjects except&#xD;
by forced loan, was knocked from his chair by his&#xD;
Majesty, who also attempted, and actually succeed-&#xD;
ed, in rolling him upon.a large fire burning in the&#xD;
state apartment. The thing washushed up. The&#xD;
papers merely mentioned it as a heated dispute&#xD;
which had occurred in the cabinet; but it leaked&#xD;
out from the resulting indisposition of the minister&#xD;
and the extraordinary smell of camphor for a&#xD;
week or two thereafter, hanging about his palace!&#xD;
Ha! ba!"&#xD;
Our hero had been left alone by Mr. Noblock&#xD;
for a few moments, the latter having retired to a&#xD;
secret place for the purpose of coining a few re-&#xD;
marks he intended to offer the society after the&#xD;
recess. At all these, conversations and others&#xD;
which he overheard, Moses's interest increased in&#xD;
the affairs of the society, and he awaited with&#xD;
some impatience the renewal of the session. When&#xD;
it was resumed, the first matter under considera-&#xD;
tion was a suggestion of a plan to he issued to dis-&#xD;
tressed countries for paying their debts, which,&#xD;
considering that it was to come from a society&#xD;
&#xD;
whose treasurer had just reported themii heavily&#xD;
in debt themselves, Moses was forced to look upon&#xD;
s as one of those eminent practical jokes with which&#xD;
humane members of such bodies now and then&#xD;
t take occasion to relieve the profound labors&#xD;
thereof. The plan, however, was unanimously&#xD;
adopted, and the president then called the atten-&#xD;
tion of the society episodically to a communica-&#xD;
tion which he had received from a benevolent as-&#xD;
sociation, sn association which he thought it&#xD;
unnecessary to designate, requesting that a col-&#xD;
lection should be taken up in the meeting on be-&#xD;
half of its charitable fund; that he would noteven&#xD;
present this communication to the society, as the&#xD;
proceedings desired would undoubtedly be a gross&#xD;
violation of parliamentary propriety, the society&#xD;
being strictly political. This announcement was&#xD;
received with a whirlwind of applause, and after&#xD;
it had died away, Mr. Noblock seized the oppor-&#xD;
tunity to address the chair. From the shortness&#xD;
of his preparation, however, he rambled so in his&#xD;
exordium that he shortly sat down in some con-&#xD;
fusion, no one apparently taking any notice of&#xD;
him from beginning to end, except our hero and&#xD;
a young man near him, who both applauded with&#xD;
much benevolent violence whenever he was stuck&#xD;
in the heaviness of the road lie was endeavoring&#xD;
to journey upon. Professor Quattler having by&#xD;
this time- vamped up the recent thunder, stolen&#xD;
from Small, now offered it. But that defrauded&#xD;
gentleman had not been idle. At his instigation&#xD;
the corresponding secretary immediately rose and&#xD;
read 'a letter to the society in his possession from&#xD;
France, which stated that a society exactly simi-&#xD;
lar to theirs in its objects and composition, estab-&#xD;
lished in that country, had lately been broken up&#xD;
by order of the Emperor, the officers exiled and&#xD;
their property confiscated to the government.&#xD;
Taking a common-sense view of this news in&#xD;
connection with the resolution to be dispatched&#xD;
to the Emperor, it seemed rather to render the&#xD;
latter a work of supererogation, and Small at once&#xD;
stated that such was his opinion.  Enraged at&#xD;
this, Professor Quattler launched forth into an&#xD;
account of the obscure life of his antagonist's&#xD;
father, and intimated the depravity of his previous&#xD;
ancestors. The debate immediately assumed, in&#xD;
consequence, the character which is usually.lesig-&#xD;
nated by the reporters as "one of great strength&#xD;
and vigor of repartee." The aged president&#xD;
sniffed at Mr. Small and ordered hin to take his&#xD;
seat, and though the latter radically announced&#xD;
his intention of doing no such thing, he was con-&#xD;
servatively pushed off his balance amid under it by&#xD;
the parliamentary effort of an adjacent member&#xD;
to second the efforts of the president. Thereupon&#xD;
the resolute Small, extricating himself, created&#xD;
great sensation by attempting to defy both Pro-&#xD;
fessor Quattler and his adherent, and by openly&#xD;
characterizing the former as' a "Machiavellian&#xD;
cogger and villain !"&#xD;
"Send for a dictionary !" said Professor Quat-&#xD;
tIer, with much vehemence. "Do you apply those&#xD;
terms to me radically or conservatively, sir ?"&#xD;
" Radically, sir. I regard you radically and&#xD;
unmitigatedly as a cogger and villain !" repeated&#xD;
the excited Small.&#xD;
" Very well, then, I am satisfied !" replied Pro-&#xD;
fessor Quattler, turning over the dictionary, which&#xD;
a secretary handed to him. "I find, Mr. Presi-&#xD;
dent, the primary and radical meaning of the&#xD;
word cogger to be one who makes cog-wheels, and&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7256-00000012"/>&#xD;
22                       MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
the word villain was originally applied, sir, to a&#xD;
poor but very respectable class of Englishmen.&#xD;
I am, therefore, perfectly satisfied with the epithets,&#xD;
and under these circumstances I am willing that&#xD;
any question of the gentleman's expulsion from&#xD;
the society turning upon his acknowledgment of&#xD;
radicalism in the matter shall be entirely waived,"&#xD;
continued he with great magnanimity.&#xD;
A round of applause followed this lofty exam-&#xD;
ple of forgiveness, by which the astounded Small&#xD;
was undoubtedly saved from being promptly ex-&#xD;
pelled from the association. As that confused gen-&#xD;
tleman stared at his antagonist, the consideration&#xD;
of the resolution was resumed with renewed inter-&#xD;
est, and its passage was even imminent, when&#xD;
fate and justice interfered again by a new and&#xD;
most unexpected interruption of the proceedings.&#xD;
The outer doors of the hall were suddenly thrown&#xD;
open and a large body of strangers, entering with&#xD;
resistless violence, filled up the vacant seats and&#xD;
the aisles. They were headed by a female of middle&#xD;
age, carrying a blue umbrella, with which, as a&#xD;
victorious oriflamme, she waved on those who&#xD;
followed her. It was ascertained to be a body of&#xD;
radical abolitionists from Cheever's church, re-&#xD;
solved into a committee of the whole to assist in&#xD;
the peace movement of the National Society; for&#xD;
the feminine leader immediately informed the&#xD;
venerable president of this sympathetic object,&#xD;
and to show it, proceeded at once to pour forth in a&#xD;
vigorous and defiant manner a torrent of philippic&#xD;
eloquence'against him and the society generally&#xD;
for its laxity and imbecile conservatism.&#xD;
The faculties of the aged officer were for a time&#xD;
entirely absorbed by this unexpected onslaught,&#xD;
Aroused at last by the increased vigor of her vitu-&#xD;
peration, he endeavored to recover his parliament-&#xD;
ary comprehension.&#xD;
"You are a female and entirely out of order,&#xD;
ma'am !" exclaimed he, aghast.&#xD;
"I move she be put in order then," cried a&#xD;
humane voice. "I move she be permitted to&#xD;
address the society."&#xD;
'The president rose to expostulate, which was&#xD;
an unfortunate action, for he was immediately&#xD;
regarded as having put the question, and he had&#xD;
scarcely said three words, when he was greeted&#xD;
with an overwhelming shout Of "Ay !"&#xD;
" And I move that brother Gardensarse, brother&#xD;
Lommeydew and sisters Alltork, Doolittle, and&#xD;
Quock, be added to the number of vice-presidents&#xD;
of the society !" roared the owner of the voice,&#xD;
evidently tickled with his success.&#xD;
At another tremendous shout of " Ay," two&#xD;
colored gentlemen and three females stepped upon&#xD;
the platform, and took their seats in the midst of&#xD;
the astounded vice-presidents.&#xD;
The aged president was fast giving way. Pro-&#xD;
fessor Quattler pushed toward him. With a gasp&#xD;
the aged president called Professor Quattler to&#xD;
the chair, and tottering to the music-stands, sank&#xD;
from view among them.&#xD;
" This will not do ! This will not do, gentle-&#xD;
men !" cried the new chairman vigorously. "It&#xD;
ia not parliamentary. You are not qualified as&#xD;
members, and I declare you out of order !"&#xD;
" But we are !" "I am a member 1" "I am a cor-&#xD;
responding member!" "I aman honorary!" "I&#xD;
subscribed money to the organization, and brother&#xD;
Bollick, there, is a member also, art thee not?"&#xD;
were a few of the cries which resounded through&#xD;
the entire body of the house at this ruling of tle&#xD;
&#xD;
professor, and a number of Quakerly-dressed&#xD;
gentlemen, and others in the ordinary garb of&#xD;
civilized beings, arose to view.I&#xD;
Influenced by this illusive 'appearance of right&#xD;
the temporary chairnian, from the confusion of&#xD;
his unusual position, very unwisely referred the,&#xD;
question of eligibility to the society, and another&#xD;
overwhelming shout in the affirmative put him in&#xD;
the very uncomfortable predicament of being&#xD;
obliged to declare the whofe proceedings to be in&#xD;
order.&#xD;
" Brother Garrison, you have prepared the re-&#xD;
solution ? Let me have it here," said the female&#xD;
orator, energetically, to a benevolent-looking ir-&#xD;
rupter beside her. The latter handed her a paper,&#xD;
from which, above the increasing confusion, she&#xD;
read, for the society's deliberation, the following&#xD;
brief but pointed resolution:  ,&#xD;
" Resolved, That this society is -in favor of,&#xD;
and will henceforth lend its aid to the immediate&#xD;
emancipation of the slaves; the abolition of&#xD;
flogging in the navy; of rum-shops, and of that&#xD;
dastardly tool of an infamous oligarchy, the&#xD;
United States Supreme Court !"&#xD;
The last lingering remnant of the conservative&#xD;
Professor Quattler's presence of mind was rapidly&#xD;
disappearing with the increasing noise of the&#xD;
antagonistic elements of the assemblage. . He&#xD;
had just enough left to attempt the ingenious&#xD;
maneuver of declaring the society duly adjourned.&#xD;
In his failure, he jumped wildly into the body of&#xD;
the house, and his place was immediately taken&#xD;
by one of the new vice-presidents. The resolu-&#xD;
tion was triumphantly passed, and an indescrib-&#xD;
able confusion now ensued, both on the stage&#xD;
among the vice-presidents as well as among the&#xD;
members. The rage and disappointment of the&#xD;
original members increased.  Amid repeated&#xD;
noise of hustling and pushing, and cries of "Mem-&#xD;
bers of the society will come to order l" "Shame-&#xD;
ful !" WYou ass, come to order 1"  "Silence!"&#xD;
and an endeavor of some of the wretched con-&#xD;
servative members to sing "Old Hundred," as a&#xD;
sedative, Moses crept out of the hall, after vainly&#xD;
attempting to reach his friend, Mr. Noblock, who&#xD;
was hopelessly involved in the crowd of disputants,&#xD;
and in a doubtful physical contest with a stout&#xD;
Quaker.&#xD;
The radical barbarians had already succeeded&#xD;
in their principal intention of giving to the con-&#xD;
servative organization a black and revolutionary&#xD;
aspect, from which it could not recover for six,&#xD;
months at the very least, and soon succeeded in&#xD;
the supplementary pleasantry to which they were&#xD;
now devoting themselves, of ejecting the National&#xD;
instructors by violence from  their hall.  The&#xD;
delighted Small had the intense gratification for&#xD;
a long while after this day of seeing his enemy,&#xD;
Professor Quattler, deprived of much popularity&#xD;
on account of the former, and there is every rea-&#xD;
son to believe that he was satisfied with what&#xD;
physically occurred to that gentleman during the&#xD;
latter.&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
MISS WAGBULL AT HOrd-&#xD;
Moszs essayed a second time successfully in&#xD;
presenting himself at Miss Wagbull's threshold&#xD;
without mistake. -By philosophically reflecting&#xD;
that it was. but a human being whose presence he&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WI&#xD;
was seeking, he had managed to subdue his ro-&#xD;
mantic enthusiasm to a degree or two below that&#xD;
which is commonly known as infatuation in the&#xD;
thermometer of human hallucination. Still the&#xD;
feelings which inspired the immortal Burke in his&#xD;
brilliant allusion to the lovely Queen of France,&#xD;
filled the bosom of our hero, as the young lady&#xD;
received him in her drawing-room; and there is&#xD;
no doubt that standing forth, he would have&#xD;
madly extemporized an adaptation of that beauti-&#xD;
ful apostrophe before her, had not the page of&#xD;
the establishment, a rather fatuous appearing&#xD;
Irish boy of tender age, remained to stare at him,&#xD;
probably under the impression, from his majestic&#xD;
port and lordly mien, that he was the real hero&#xD;
of the latest dime novel, consumed in the entry-&#xD;
way, and- wastow appearing again in respectable&#xD;
society, in spectacles, after having mysteriously&#xD;
escaped from the dungeons of his enemy.&#xD;
"You may leave, Timothy," said the young lady.&#xD;
I have been reading Paradise Lost," remarked&#xD;
Moses to her, as he led her to a seat upon a tete-&#xD;
a-tete, "and do you know I cheerfully left Eden&#xD;
to come and see you ?"&#xD;
I hope you will not create such a disturbance&#xD;
as you did there," replied she animatedly.&#xD;
Oh ! no. It is another thing now. I have&#xD;
learned how to behave myself, in the presence of&#xD;
angels."&#xD;
I verily believe his majesty commenced with&#xD;
poorEve in this very way. But perhaps you had bet-&#xD;
ter talk in blank verse to me. I assure you I will&#xD;
not find fault with the measure," said the young&#xD;
lady- a7'ly.&#xD;
I feel as though I might employ an orchestra&#xD;
to express myself," replied Moses grandiosely.&#xD;
Dear me! and while you are thinking about&#xD;
them, perhaps I may very appropriately cry&#xD;
'fiddle-sticks' to the whole subject. And tell me,'&#xD;
has Mrs. Fasherlidge had the honor of your so-&#xD;
ciety since her reception ?"&#xD;
I have not yet called," replied he to her. "She&#xD;
seemed a kind lady, devoted to religion, and yet&#xD;
fond of social pleasures."&#xD;
Yes, though extremely religious, if she is&#xD;
still somewhat wedded to the world, it is cer-&#xD;
tainly quite excusable," said the' young lady.&#xD;
Her childhood was passed in the acquisition of&#xD;
those elegant accomplishments which render the&#xD;
homage of society a necesity to her happiness"&#xD;
It is an enviable mean," continued Moses&#xD;
thoughtfully, " to be able to cultivate, with due&#xD;
regard to each, the sublime graces of religion and&#xD;
the tasteful refinements of social mtercourse.. I&#xD;
am one of those who think that the stern religious&#xD;
enthusiast and the worldly devotee of fashion&#xD;
are alike wrong."&#xD;
"Yes, and both often unconsciously acknow-&#xD;
ledge their error," added the youig lady. "The&#xD;
one in the yearning so often evident in their&#xD;
scorn for the pleasures of social life ; the other&#xD;
in the casual sincerity with which they seek the&#xD;
glorious shield of religion in affliction."&#xD;
"But among all the examples of the eccentri-&#xD;
cities of human nature," continued Moses, re-&#xD;
flectively, " I think that of persons-ladies mov-&#xD;
ing in intelligent society-whom we read of at-&#xD;
tempting to chemically compound fashion and&#xD;
religion, to be the most extraordinary. Their&#xD;
pastors might be well occupied in pointing out to&#xD;
them the ludicrous incongruity, if not the spirit-&#xD;
ual danger of such a course."&#xD;
&#xD;
NKFIELD.                                   23&#xD;
"Were such a discourse elegantly composed,&#xD;
with brilliant metaphors and original similes,&#xD;
and eloquently delivered in the sweet, rich tones&#xD;
of tin orotund voice, they would listen to it."&#xD;
"You surely would not intimate, Miss Wagbull,&#xD;
that any woman takes an interest in religion but&#xD;
for such excitements? The universal suscep-&#xD;
tibility of woman to true religion has been regard-&#xD;
ed as a proof of the providential care of heaven&#xD;
for the best interests of man !&#xD;
"Yes, and I may incidentally observe these&#xD;
divines have certainly reason to think so !" re-&#xD;
plied Miss Wagbull, smiling at Moses's earnest-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
"Dear me !" cried Moses warmly, " I do not&#xD;
wish to believe that such females as'I have read&#xD;
of do exist. But I have read, Miss Wagbull,&#xD;
that in the accompaniments of real religion, in&#xD;
charity for the real poor, for the gross and vul-&#xD;
gar, the rude in speech, the base in sentiments&#xD;
and squalid in garments, some are wanting; that&#xD;
there are some by whom Charity, the divine&#xD;
nymph, is only imagined with the loveliness of&#xD;
their own faces and the graces of their own per-&#xD;
sons."&#xD;
" And how could they wish to come in contact&#xD;
with a sufferer," added tbe young lady, "-less ele-&#xD;
gant than themselves, with one who does not&#xD;
possess the power of pathetic and polished lan-&#xD;
guage and manners, to manifest the gratitude&#xD;
with' which the niunificent bounty has over-&#xD;
whelmed her?"&#xD;
" Well, after all," replied Moses, " even such&#xD;
benevolence, mingled as it is with the sentlimen-&#xD;
tality of romance, is better than none. Elegance&#xD;
or charity is not so reprehensible as the other,&#xD;
elegance of religion. I have read, also," con-&#xD;
tinued he, reverting again involuntarily, "of such&#xD;
women being frequently tyrants in their house-&#xD;
hold, regardless alike of the welfare of their&#xD;
children and the feelings of their husbands ind&#xD;
servants, and entertaining no idea but that of&#xD;
their own wants, their own dignity and import-&#xD;
ance. And while exercising prudence in manag-&#xD;
ing their household, they do so principally fotr&#xD;
the purpose of adorning their own persons with&#xD;
the costly habiliments constantly dictated by the&#xD;
arbitrary rules of fashion, with the hope of secur-&#xD;
ing for themselves the approbation which the&#xD;
world will bestow upon the brilliancy and the x-&#xD;
quisite taste of their decorations."&#xD;
The young lady again smiled at Moses's earnest-&#xD;
ness, but nevertheless listened to him atten-&#xD;
tively.&#xD;
"I have heard, also," continued he, "of such&#xD;
persons filling their private letters to absent friends&#xD;
with artful expressions of affection, and with the&#xD;
most generous and disinterested sentiments, and&#xD;
yet often making themselves merry with the foibles&#xD;
of those friends, regardless alike of their own&#xD;
modesty and the sacredness of friendship. How-&#xD;
ever, I hope you have not met with any instance&#xD;
of such, Miss Wagbull ?" asked Moses, with&#xD;
what seemed to her a real wistful hope of meet-&#xD;
ing with a denial from her.&#xD;
"Oh! no," replied the young lady, " except per-&#xD;
haps only when the wit was without apparent&#xD;
malice, and merely intended to excite the mirth&#xD;
of those present."&#xD;
" Ah ! that is perhaps pardonable. And I have&#xD;
heard, also," continued Moses, " of such persons&#xD;
being disposed to treat the experience of the&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
aged, and the authority of the scientific, with&#xD;
the superciliousness of an assumed superiority.&#xD;
Yes, to feign a blush, not for themselves, but at&#xD;
the bold presumption of these-"&#xD;
He was here fortunately relieved of the un-&#xD;
pleasant subject by the entrance of an aged lady,&#xD;
accompanied by a stout middle-aged gentleman&#xD;
with a flowing head of black hair. They both&#xD;
resembled the young lady sufficiently to be at&#xD;
once taken by Moses to be her relatives. The&#xD;
gentleman had a kindred smile, and the old lady,&#xD;
though apparently feeble in person, appeared to&#xD;
possess the vigorous spirit, which Moses had been&#xD;
delighted with in the young lady.&#xD;
" Why, grandmother ! have you returned so&#xD;
soon ?" exclaimed the latter.  "Mr. Winkfield,&#xD;
this is my grandmother. Father, Mr. Wink-&#xD;
field!"&#xD;
The gentlema shook Moses's hand heartily,&#xD;
and the old lady bade him resume his seat.&#xD;
"cAny relation of the Chadwicks of Rensselaer&#xD;
county ?" asked she, somewhat peremptorily.&#xD;
" No, ma'am, not that I am aware of," replied&#xD;
Moses.&#xD;
"1Hum ! you have the Chadwick nose. I sup-&#xD;
posed you were," continued the old lady, appear-&#xD;
ing irritated at the disappointment. As she ap-&#xD;
peared about to continue her remarks, there was&#xD;
a deferential pause on the part of all three.&#xD;
"1However, it is my opinion," continued she&#xD;
shortly, "it is my opinion you don't know who&#xD;
your relations are. The young snippers of the&#xD;
present generation don't wish to have any, and&#xD;
old times and genealogy are despised by 'em,"&#xD;
concluded she, deeply aggrieved.&#xD;
"I hope you will not class me, ma'am," said&#xD;
Moses, "with those who have cast odium upon&#xD;
their generation, by their flippant disregard of&#xD;
such matters. I feel, with you, the error of their&#xD;
course I&#xD;
"orWhere did you come from? I've never seen&#xD;
you before ?" asked the old lady in such a man-&#xD;
ner as wouldnodoubt have confused Moses sx&#xD;
ceedingrly, had he not noticed that both her son&#xD;
and her grandaughter looked as if they would&#xD;
like to have him humor her age.&#xD;
"1Mr. Winkfield is from Massachusetts, grand-.&#xD;
other replied the young lady.&#xD;
11Well, Iam sorry for it," continued 'the old&#xD;
lady, ferociously.  "They are a stuck-up race.&#xD;
However, there are some good people there.&#xD;
There is Governor Doolittle. I met him at Gover-&#xD;
nor Tompkins's inauguration ball. He is a well-in-&#xD;
formed gentleman, and his wife a lovely woman.&#xD;
But the Massachusetts people are generally stuck&#xD;
up and pretentious I"&#xD;
Moses being aware of the fact that Governor&#xD;
Tompkins had become a part of history, and, in&#xD;
fact, had been dead for about thirty years, natural&#xD;
ly concluded that the old lady had not exactly kept&#xD;
up with the progress of events, and was, perhaps&#xD;
disposed to consider her generation as the last ol&#xD;
any account upon the earth.&#xD;
"n What has put grandma in such a bad humor.&#xD;
papa?" whispered the granddaughter to her pa-&#xD;
rent.&#xD;
"I don't know. She was in high spirits at&#xD;
the Pompenkops before we came in- It is sin&#xD;

sic. Mother, don't you wish to hear Bessie sing?'&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, I don't mind if I do," replied the old&#xD;
lady snappishly, and looking severely at our hero,&#xD;
who was blushing in pleasure at the proposition,&#xD;
and had gently risen to open the instrument.&#xD;
" Always the way 1 They like the fiddlin', tid-&#xD;
dlin' accompaniment better than they do the&#xD;
song! What's become of the musical taste now-&#xD;
adays ? I would sing myself for you, sir, if I&#xD;
thought the young men of the present day knew&#xD;
any thing about expression or execution ! But&#xD;
no, I will not! I will not !" continued she, as&#xD;
if determined to subject Moses to this bitter&#xD;
disappointment.&#xD;
The exquisite sympathy of the young lady's&#xD;
voice, as she judiciously selected and sung a sim-&#xD;
ple air of the old lady's youthful days, lent beauty&#xD;
to the grotesque seediness of the Iflusic itself. A&#xD;
thrill of pleasure darted through his vitality at&#xD;
each note, and he expressed his gratification by&#xD;
running his fingers through his hair.&#xD;
"My darling girl!" said the old lady, as her&#xD;
smiling granddaughter approached her, after she&#xD;
had finished. Though the momentary result of&#xD;
this experiment upon her feelings was a dispo.&#xD;
sition of the venerable female to throw herself&#xD;
upon the young lady's neck, her irritation seem-&#xD;
ed presently to 'return with increased vigor.&#xD;
" My dear child," continued she, "never shall&#xD;
you leave me. 'You shall live all your life to be&#xD;
a comfort to. your old grandmother 1" At this&#xD;
point she seemed disposed to sniff at the sur-&#xD;
prised Moses.&#xD;
" By the way, mother, if Mr. Winkfield will ex-&#xD;
cuse business, wouldn't you like to come into the&#xD;
tea-room a moment? I want to consult you about,&#xD;
that lease," said Mr. Wagbull, as both he and&#xD;
his daughter observed that the old lady's dis-&#xD;
pleasure appeared to be rather on the increase&#xD;
than otherwise.&#xD;
" Very well-yes, I will. I am going to bed&#xD;
pretty soon," said the old lady, gazing at Moses&#xD;
again ; "and it is time for all honest people to be&#xD;
there."&#xD;
Moses indeed was beginning to feel quite un-&#xD;
comfortable, and would have implicitly taken the&#xD;
hint of the aged relic of the past had not the&#xD;
young lady immediately diverted his attention by&#xD;
some pleasant remarks upon the curiosities of&#xD;
old times and fashions. Although he could plain-&#xD;
ly see by the shadow upon the glass doors- that&#xD;
the old lady now and then came forward to watch&#xD;
him through the crack thereof, and although at&#xD;
one time he thought he heard the epithet "jack-&#xD;
anapes I" audibly expressed therefrom, he was&#xD;
still fain to continue; and afterward, when a&#xD;
ifoise of some one throwing things around, and&#xD;
with a cracked voice apparently pitching into a&#xD;
domestic in the chamber overhead, reminded him&#xD;
- that perhaps an hour and a half was sufficient for&#xD;
a first call, he still lingered to converse with the&#xD;
father, who was evidently much pleased with so&#xD;
attentive a listener to his political reflections.&#xD;
He even insisted upon regaling our hero there-&#xD;
with, as far as Madison Square, upon the latter's&#xD;
return home. As Moses could not resist the de-&#xD;
sire to interrupt the other with repeated reflec-&#xD;
tions upon his enjoyrent of the evening and the&#xD;

emani suddenly informed him, with an air of ex-&#xD;

Uon retahng this hotel Moses found a letter&#xD;

also, to disclose himself, until the plans were&#xD;
more matured. He therefore generously under-&#xD;
took to place himself for the moment beneath&#xD;
the old-fashioned sofa upon which he was sitting,&#xD;
not deeming it undignified or improper, under&#xD;
the circumstances. He had scarcely succeeded&#xD;
in this, when the parties at the door, consisting of&#xD;
a solemn lady, weighing between three hundred&#xD;
and four hundred pounds, and a gentleman of&#xD;
ordinary dimensions, came into the room,'Pot&#xD;
slowly or with the customary gait, but with all&#xD;
the evidences of a panic. The gentleman pushed&#xD;
violently past the lady, ran wildly around the&#xD;
centre-table, and then, without uttering a word,&#xD;
pursued his way through the rear door into the&#xD;
hall, from which he rapidly sought an apartment&#xD;
on the other side.  The lady tottered toward&#xD;
the sofa, beneath which our hero lay concealed,&#xD;
and upon which she fell with all the inanimate&#xD;
force of thorough consternation. The bottom&#xD;
and springs of the seat were broken by this, and&#xD;
the whole superimposed weight was precipitated&#xD;
upon the person of our hero, who was conse-&#xD;
quently squtezed within an imch of his existence.&#xD;
With the theory that an untimely earthquake&#xD;
had suddenly taken place, he would have gasped&#xD;
a suffocated appeal to be rescued from the dread-&#xD;
ful pressure of the ruins, had he not heard an&#xD;
indistinct voice from the mass resting upon him.&#xD;
There is a person at the door begging for&#xD;
charity, who has had the small-pox !" observed&#xD;
that voice in accents of terror.&#xD;
Enlightened by these words upon the nature&#xD;
of the situation, he endured for a few moments&#xD;
thereafter with heroic magnanimity the severe'&#xD;
torture, convulsively endeavoring to alleviate the&#xD;
same by reflections upon the grand but inexora-&#xD;
ble laws of gravitation. The young lady hastily&#xD;
rang the bell for aid. The domestics came, and&#xD;
with the assistance of the gentleman, who had&#xD;
by this tune properly taken the prophylactic step&#xD;
of drinking a glass of brandy from the medicine.&#xD;
chest in the library, the lady was removed from&#xD;
the sofa and ultimately to her room. The dis-&#xD;

had retired therefrom, disgusted at the failure&#xD;
of his charge ipon the benevolence of the man-&#xD;
sion, and at a proper opportunity shortly after-&#xD;

CIIAPTER XIII.&#xD;
MR. THOMAS TITAN. M'SS VISITS THE REGIONS&#xD;
OF THE NEW BoWERY AND CREATES AN EXCITE-&#xD;
MENT THERE.&#xD;
Ma. TITMAN, the noble Dibbletonian gladiator&#xD;
of society, arrived at the Evercroft House, and im-&#xD;
mediately elected himself as a temporary follower&#xD;
of our hero. In an interesting autobiographical&#xD;
sketch he illuminated the pleasant fact that he&#xD;
was an older alumnus of the college from which&#xD;
Moses had graduated.&#xD;
"Class of '51," said Mr. Titman. " Great times&#xD;
Swe used to have. We were regarded by the whole&#xD;
faculty as the most talented class that ever had&#xD;
appear ed in the college. I remember onde, ha !&#xD;
ha ! when four of us threw a log of wood through&#xD;
&#xD;
hi&#xD;
&#xD;
one of the juniors' windows, and knocked down&#xD;
 half the class ! Hodle never liked us, and re-&#xD;
k paid us one day. We had tied a goat in his chair.&#xD;
He came in and seeing the aniinal, says lie,&#xD;
' Gentlemen, I perceive you have at last a teach.&#xD;
I er whom you can appreciate!' and for a week&#xD;
after we vere compelled by the faculty, in sec-&#xD;
i tions, to feed our new  professor with cabbage&#xD;
leaves, to comb his beard, and pay him other&#xD;
delicate toilet attentions, two of us being special-&#xD;
ly detailed to sit solenly during the hour at ei-&#xD;
ther side of him as assistant professors, ha! ha I"&#xD;
From these and other anecdotes, Moses soon&#xD;
learned that his lively friend had not been much&#xD;
given to study during his collegiate career, that&#xD;
his stay there had been abruptly terminated be-&#xD;
fore the usual period, and that he now profes-&#xD;
sionally affected architecture, engineering, and&#xD;
drawing. As the conversation proceeded, Moses&#xD;
was captivated by his vivacity, and his own man-&#xD;
ner in turn quite won the confidence of the little&#xD;
man, so much so that after the latter had refilled&#xD;
is glass with wine a second time lie revealed to&#xD;
our hero his susceptibility to female influence by&#xD;
intimating that his temporary absence from Dib-&#xD;
bletown was partly to allay an affair of that na-&#xD;
ture, in which he was involved with two sisters,&#xD;
who apparently had both haplessly fallen into&#xD;
the same infatuation.&#xD;
" They are large, noble girls, both of 'em)"&#xD;
continued Mr. Titman. " Taller than I. And&#xD;
such flow of feeling ! Something so fresh about&#xD;
them. Such artless envy, such fighting and jeal&#xD;
ousy, and. all on my account!   I don't know&#xD;
which one to take. I am really puzzled, they are'&#xD;
so nearly alike in their affection ; and such is&#xD;
their harmony and sisterly love in all matters&#xD;
excepting this, that I've felt it my duty to give&#xD;
neither any encouragement, and in fact to draw&#xD;
off to avoid breaking tip this lovely tenderness.&#xD;
My lot is hard. I've either to give up my love or&#xD;
commit-this crime of-"&#xD;
" It is certainly an unpleasant position to be&#xD;
placed in," interrupted Moses sympathetically.&#xD;
Indeed it is. I did once temporarily make,&#xD;
up my mind and go so far as to rashly write&#xD;
some poetry to one of them, offering myself. She&#xD;
misconstrued the sentiment, however, as it was&#xD;
in poetry, and it passed over. If it had been in&#xD;
prose, she would have understood it."&#xD;
" The merit of poetry nowadays does seem to&#xD;
consist it its unintelligibility," said Moses.&#xD;
"It's much easier to write than prose," replied&#xD;
Mr. Titman. " Half tie time you don't have to&#xD;
bother yourself with the ideas; it is only the&#xD;
sound you must look to. There was a phrase in&#xD;
mine about her having ' some one to look 7p to.'&#xD;
I meant it metaphorically, of course, but she&#xD;
must have applied it literally and got mixed up&#xD;
its th-at way !&#xD;
Thus running on, the evening cheerfully passed,&#xD;
during which Moses became thoroughly acquaint-&#xD;
ed with his pleasant fellow-alumnus' character.&#xD;
The next morning after breakfast our hero pro-&#xD;
posed quietly ascertaining t1he true condition of&#xD;
the ginger-snap man. At the hotel door lie had&#xD;

" Have you not yet taken means, Mr. Wink-&#xD;
field," continued the laly, looking solemnly at&#xD;
Moses, "to secure redemption ?"&#xD;
" Madam, I hope it will be no false presump-&#xD;
tion for me to imagine that some religious im-&#xD;
pressions have been made upon my heart. I was&#xD;
vaccinated-I m~ban baptized at a very early&#xD;
period," replied Moses deferentially, though it&#xD;
was evident he had not yet entirely recovered his&#xD;
clearness of mind.&#xD;
Here the,young lady, either thinking to take&#xD;
advantage of the spiritual occupancy of her&#xD;
aunt, or not being disposed to regard her pre-&#xD;
sence at all, after jocosely commanding her friend&#xD;
Mr. Bunter to " shut up !" at something he was&#xD;
whispering to her, kissed him so heartily to en-&#xD;
force her commands, that it attracted the atten-&#xD;
tion of both the aunt and Mr. Winkfield.&#xD;
".Wanton disregard of propriety !" said the&#xD;
former, in a low voice to her niece. "The rules&#xD;
of life, the precepts of Christianity, have no&#xD;
effect upon you, poor child !"&#xD;
"Precepts of Christianity, Aunt Jane !" said&#xD;
the young lady in a lively manner. "Why ! am I&#xD;
not doing as I would be done by ?"&#xD;
"Scoffer," said the aunt in a shocked state,&#xD;
" cease your impiety, or heaven may yet visit this&#xD;
house with punishment for the deeds that are&#xD;
done in it !"&#xD;
"Very likely, iunt," replied the. young lady&#xD;
significantly.&#xD;
" But do you take any interest in the revival&#xD;
of the languishing cause of vital Christianity,&#xD;
Mr. Winkfield ?" continued the aunt, again turn&#xD;
ing to Moses,. "Is it substantial piety you would&#xD;
embrace ?"&#xD;
" Ha ! ha ! My dear aunt, why not try him?'&#xD;
said Susie, tittering,&#xD;
" I mean, do you feel the efficacy of repent&#xD;
ance, sir ?" continued the aunt, blushing and look&#xD;
ing more severely than ever at her niece.&#xD;
" Oh I yes, madam; but I believe in bringing&#xD;
- sinners to punishment too, as well as repentance,'&#xD;
replied Moses. "Though I am well aware tha&#xD;
there are many conscientious, sterling Christian&#xD;
like you, madam, who are so kind of heart, an&#xD;
so scrupulously desirous of rightly following th&#xD;
precepts of Christianity, that such a principI&#xD;
seems to them- both unmerciful and wrong."&#xD;
Won by Moses's compliment, the worthy lad,&#xD;
smiled softly upon him, and endeavored to loo&#xD;
as conscientious and sterling as possible. Whil&#xD;
she was engaged in this act of amiable weakness&#xD;
a gentleman of a dark-olive complexion, in a cl&#xD;
real neck-cloth, an unbuttoned sack overcoat an&#xD;
yarn slippers, which appeared to constitute hI&#xD;
habitual undress uniform, entered the room. fH&#xD;
appeared extremely well-conditioned, and wore&#xD;
pleased expression, which seemed as if it had bee&#xD;
recently oiled up with a glass or two of old Otar&#xD;
"Ah Miss Susannah! and my friend Mr. Bunt&#xD;
is here to-day," said he, smiling benignantly upo&#xD;
them. "And, I beg pardon-"&#xD;
"This is Mr. Winkfield, a friend of my niec&#xD;
Mr. Hunkeyfell," said the aunt.&#xD;
"Ah ! her friend, I see; a fine, ingenuous cou&#xD;

face with great intensity.)  "Are you awaiting&#xD;

to miss nonie of the finer passages of the drums,&#xD;
trumpets and other delicate instruments.  The&#xD;
orchestra was already in and busily engaged in&#xD;
exasperating the more sensitive lovers of music&#xD;
in the house with a prolonged tuning operation.&#xD;
"Good gracious ! we're late !" exclaimed Mr.&#xD;
Titman. "They've already commenced !"&#xD;
Moses disabused his fellow dilettante's mind.&#xD;
" And we are extremely fortunate I think"&#xD;
continued he, "in obtaining this box. It is very&#xD;
capacious; almost large enough for two more per-&#xD;

look that way again !" said Moses, blushing ex-&#xD;
ceedingly. "Don't look that way at all !"&#xD;
"I can't help it. He's finished mending 'em and&#xD;
is putting them on now."&#xD;
"Very well. I am glad of it. -How full the&#xD;

turning very pale.&#xD;
" Pshaw! An absurdity in a fire-proof building&#xD;

himself.&#xD;

he commenced to look at the splendid "landscape&#xD;
with animals" about him. There was every style&#xD;
of beauty, and every form of elegant maniiness.&#xD;
The fair blonde with her heavenliness, and the&#xD;
buxom brunette with her earthliness.  There&#xD;
were belles who appeared to be in a bewitching&#xD;
state of betweenity, and others who looked as&#xD;
though they had escaped from the place under.&#xD;
neath the earth. When Mr. Titan become be-&#xD;
wildered with his inspection of this dazzling array,&#xD;
he turned his lorgnette to the fresco and to the&#xD;
chandelier and then suddenly reverted to the sub-&#xD;
ject of his previous apprehension.&#xD;
"Do you think there is any cause of alarm&#xD;
Winkfield ? I-I positively smell smoke," whis-&#xD;
pered he to Moses. "Suppose the house was on&#xD;
fire in the basement ? 0 dear !"&#xD;
" Pshaw! nonsense! Be quiet and sit still,"&#xD;
replied Moses, convulsively placing his hand upon&#xD;
the railing beside him, as if lie were about to&#xD;
jump over the box inclosure.&#xD;
" We won't try to get out now, shall we ?"&#xD;
asked Mr. Titman, who was very pale.&#xD;
" No, no. Alarm the entire house. Hundreds&#xD;
would be crushed to death. Besides that, we&#xD;
can't !"&#xD;
" I feel very fatigued," again said Mr. Titman.&#xD;
' Suppose we retire. I understand the piece for&#xD;
he evening is very uninteresting !"&#xD;
"I'll thank you to move your chairs one side,"&#xD;
said a polite usher to our friends at this point.&#xD;
Behind him in the alley stood six strangers.&#xD;
' These gentlemen have standing room in this&#xD;

also made some very uneasy reflections upon the person, clinging with fear to a rope, swung across&#xD;

of the house,. As he swung back -again he con-&#xD;
vulsively drew up his person to the rope, appar-&#xD;
ently in terror at the distance\ from the floor, and&#xD;
wildly called for help. At the third vibration,&#xD;
and while the attention of thb entire house was&#xD;
becoming directed to this singular spectacle,.and&#xD;
the enthusiastic tenor rose to resume his dying&#xD;
Throes on a safer part of the stage, a circular&#xD;
movement was given to the rope by the efforts of&#xD;
some one in the scenery trying to catch the&#xD;
'flying object, and to the observation of the&#xD;
bewildered and alarmed Moses was turned the&#xD;
terrified countenance of Mr. Titman.&#xD;
A roar of applause from a party of sailors in&#xD;
the amphitheatre drowned the latter's frantic&#xD;
enunciation of his inability to hold on much&#xD;
longer. The mariners, who had strayed into the&#xD;
theatre and patiently sat out the fiddling, thought&#xD;
they were going to be rewarded with a grand&#xD;
acrobatic display; taking-Mr. Titman's frantic&#xD;
posturing, together with the tossing of the tenor&#xD;
below, to be a commencement of the chief per-&#xD;
formances of the evening.&#xD;
"Place a mattress or something beneath him!"&#xD;
cried Moses, starting in alarm for his friend.&#xD;
"Dear me! he'll break his neck!"&#xD;
Here the musical critic could be plainly seen in&#xD;
the wing humanely making another effort to grasp&#xD;
his unfortunate acquaintance, as another oscilla-&#xD;
tion took place.&#xD;
Amid the confusion of the audience, the alarm&#xD;
of the ladies, the jeers of the more unfeeling, and&#xD;
the rude noises of encouragement by the sailors&#xD;
and others above, the curtain fortunately fell;&#xD;
and a moment thereafter Moses heard a noise&#xD;
disagreeably indicating that something else behind&#xD;
it had also undoubtedly fallen. He hurried to&#xD;
the stage with Mr. Wagbull. They there found&#xD;
Mr. Titman, surrounded by counts, duchesses, and&#xD;
scene-shifters, evidently mor4 affected by the&#xD;
sympathy which a tall young lady of the chorus&#xD;
was endeavoring to bestow upn him in mingled&#xD;
Dutch and English, than by the harm which had&#xD;
been done to his person.&#xD;
"You see, I was walking about up there, and&#xD;
looking down on the stage, when I leaned against&#xD;
what I thought was a wall," explained he to&#xD;
Moses, as they returned to Miss Wagbull's box.&#xD;
"It was only a part of a scene. It was fortunate&#xD;
I caught the rope, or I would have broken my&#xD;
head or done something disagreeable."&#xD;
Moses's dark feelings had been dissipated by&#xD;
the mimic excitements of the scene; and if they&#xD;
had not thus been, they would have been certain-&#xD;
ly by the real one which he now experienced, of&#xD;
placing Miss Wagbull's cloak about her, and&#xD;
waiting upon her to her carriage. It was proba-&#xD;
bly owing to his lofty feelings at this extreme&#xD;
honor, that Titman could induce him, only by coun-&#xD;
terfeiting painful thirst, to enter a lager-beer shop&#xD;
on the way homeward. While therein, also, the lit-&#xD;
tle gentleman got into difficulty with Moses, from&#xD;
having been so much carried away by the Saxo-&#xD;
nian beauty of the attendant girl, as to kiss her.&#xD;
As he appeared somewhat penitent, however,&#xD;
during Moses's lecture, the latter relented, and&#xD;
acknowledging that the act was perhaps allow-&#xD;
able "as a mere tribute to beauty," seemed to&#xD;
Mr. Titman to manifest an intention of following&#xD;
his example. Upon arriving at the hotel, the lat-&#xD;
ter expressed a strong desire for a cold fowl, and&#xD;
&#xD;
thereupon Moses, still under the pressure of his&#xD;
elevated feelings, became indignant again, but&#xD;
after he had shown a slight sympathy with Mr.&#xD;
Titman's anger at the refectory being closed, the&#xD;
two at last bade each other adieu and retired for&#xD;
the night, Moses to dream of Miss Wagbull, and&#xD;
Mr. Titman of a bluelit apotheosis in theatrical&#xD;
style, with the tall young girl of the chorus.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
THE REV. MR. HUNKYFELL PLEASANTLY MAKES TIHE&#xD;
HANDSOME OFFER TO MR. WINKFIELD OF A GEN-&#xD;
ERAL BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP. THE PROGRESS OF&#xD;
THE BUNTER DIFFICULTY.&#xD;
As Moses gained the Union Park pavement, in&#xD;
turning from the Broadway promenade the next&#xD;
afternoon, some one, overtaking him, placed a&#xD;
hand upon his shoulder. Moses shuddered and&#xD;
turned around at the light velvety touch. It was&#xD;
the persons to whom he instinctively attributed&#xD;
it, the reverend Mr. Hunkyfell. Our hero first&#xD;
proposed wringing the reverend gentleman's nose&#xD;
and proceeding quietly upon his way. He then&#xD;
determined upon the better course of acceding to&#xD;
the divine's intimated desire to speak with him.&#xD;
"My dear young man," said Mr. Hunkyfell, as&#xD;
he noticed Moses's avoidance of his proffered&#xD;
hand, " excuse me, am I right in fearing that not-&#xD;
withstanding your excellent impartiality of judg-&#xD;
ment, I detected some prejudice upon your part&#xD;
toward me in our last intercourse ?"&#xD;
"You are," replied Moses.&#xD;
" And must I fear, young man, that notwith-&#xD;
standing the acute appreciation of character,&#xD;
which you appear proud of possessing, that pre-&#xD;
judice is one likely to last ?"&#xD;
"It is very likely to do so," said Moses, endea-&#xD;
voring in vain to conceal his antipathy.&#xD;
"And it is impossible for me to.remove that&#xD;
prejudice ?"&#xD;
" Utterly," replied Moses again involuntarily.&#xD;
"Alas ! then it is a vain hope which I have&#xD;
cherished.  Do you know, now, I have really&#xD;
cherished a hope since I met you, and it was my&#xD;
present object in accosting you, of being assisted&#xD;
by that judgment and by the rest of your ener-&#xD;
gies, in the noble field of pursuits to which it has&#xD;
been my pleasant lot to be called," continued the&#xD;
divine. "You are a gentleman of leisure. You&#xD;
have property and an ingenuous countenance."&#xD;
i "Sir !" said Moses ferociously.&#xD;
The reverend gentleman drew away instinctive-&#xD;
ly, but presently smiled. He seemed to consider&#xD;
it himself a rather heavy joke.&#xD;
"Then you hate me ?" asked he earnestly.&#xD;
"No, I merely despise you," replied Moses be-&#xD;
nevolently.&#xD;
"Your frankness is certainly affable," said the&#xD;
other. "There-is some virtue in your character,&#xD;
though I must say that part of it is not what has&#xD;
particularly attracted my attention."&#xD;
"Very likely," replied Moses, "that part of&#xD;
any one's character is not particularly attractive&#xD;
to you."&#xD;
"My dear sir, I allude to it not in petty irrita-&#xD;
*tion, but rather in sorrow, as, ahem! you appear&#xD;
*to enjoy the esteem, ay, even the friendship, of a&#xD;

" However, as my society appears absolutely lars. What do you say to thirty-nine thousand ?"&#xD;
detrimental to your temper, perhaps I had better "Thirty-nine thousand !"&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
Ml. TOPLADY RETURNS WITH RENEWED CONFIDENCE&#xD;
TO THE CITY, AND RELATES TO HIS NEPHEW THE&#xD;
CAUSES OF THE DIFFICULTY WHICH LED TO HIs&#xD;
LATE FLIGHT FROM IT.&#xD;
MOSES'S previous life of retirement-and medita-&#xD;
tion had not educated him by any means to the&#xD;
vivacity of a hotel. Those hours which since&#xD;
infancy he had been taught to devote either tov&#xD;
silent study or the natural recuperation of his&#xD;
physique, he observed were here especially select- 1&#xD;
ed for the ebullitions of animal activity. Did heI&#xD;
sit down in his room at night to meditate uponI&#xD;
the immortality of the soul, or the nature of&#xD;
friendship, his reflections were set to the liveliest&#xD;
kind of terpsichorean music. Or was he quietlyI&#xD;
composing himself ere he closed his eyes in-&#xD;
slumber to prove the uselessness of the passions&#xD;
compared with reason, his theory and practiceI&#xD;
were presently destroyed by the maddening&#xD;
sounds of a gentleman with a baritone voiceI&#xD;
doing the Standard-Bearer in the principal parlor,I&#xD;
or by tie equally irritating hum of a public ban-&#xD;
quet in tie dining-hall. After a brief consulta-&#xD;
tion with the clerk of the hotel and Mr. Toplady,&#xD;
whose faith in the climate of the city had been&#xD;
sufficiently restored to cause, his recent return&#xD;
from a protracted- sojourn at a country hydropa-&#xD;
thic establishment, Moses resolved to answer&#xD;
one of the numerous newspaper advertisements,&#xD;
in which " all the comforts of a home " are pro-&#xD;
mised to single gentlemen ; the latter being sup-&#xD;
posed, as they do not enjoy -the domesticity of&#xD;
married life, not to know and consequently to be&#xD;
both surprised and. delighted to learn, that such&#xD;
comforts often consist, of two boys, three girls,&#xD;
and the dear little infant in the baby-jumper.&#xD;
Our hero was fortunate enough to discover, how-&#xD;
ever, in the quiet and clean little Banks street,&#xD;
a young married couple, who having under the&#xD;
usual insane impulses, hired a house which was&#xD;
too large for them, by the whole second floor,&#xD;
now gave evidences of returning reason, by ad-&#xD;
vertising the same to be rented to some gentle-&#xD;
manly person who could assure them, by refer-&#xD;
ences, of his possession of the culture requisite&#xD;
to a proper appreciation of a second story. The&#xD;
apartments were delightful. The sleeping-room&#xD;
at the back looked out upon a little summer&#xD;
house, which needed only the coming summer to&#xD;
make it beautiful, and his front parlor command-&#xD;
ed a view of a sedate old Quaker lady in a de-&#xD;
lightful cap constantly at the second story win-&#xD;
dow opposite, pleasant at any season of the&#xD;
year.&#xD;
The young couple themselves appeared to pos-&#xD;
aess all the charming simplicity which belongs to&#xD;
youthful inexperience, and in addition to that the&#xD;
equally charming duplicity of being coqipletely&#xD;
bound up in each other. After a scrutiny of our&#xD;
hero's person, references, and remarks, somewhat&#xD;
prolonged by frequent delicate withdrawals for&#xD;
Consultation thereupon, he was finally ac-&#xD;
&#xD;
cepted by them as an occupant of their second&#xD;
light. He soon removed to these spacious and&#xD;
pleasant apartments to which be was frequently&#xD;
accompanied by Mr. Titman and Mr. Toplady&#xD;
after dinner.  The latter almost immediately&#xD;
upon his return to the city, was waited upon at&#xD;
his office by a high municipal authority and in-&#xD;
vited to meet a party of sixty other citizens on a&#xD;
jury-panel of six weeks. Having very properly&#xD;
suggested to the judge, that he might possibly&#xD;
come under the provision of the statute, exclud-&#xD;
ing lawyers from juries, from the fact of his hay-&#xD;
ing studied law at an early period of his life and&#xD;
having expressed the benevolent wish not to pre-&#xD;
judice any of the cases thereby, the court re-&#xD;
lieved him of his scruples, by stating that it&#xD;
"guessed he did not know enough law to hurt&#xD;
any thing," whereupon, after making a nenergetic&#xD;
attempt to appear as if the whole assemblage&#xD;
hadn't heard the remark, he was duly sworn in.&#xD;
What with "amicable suits," in which charges of&#xD;
perjury and bribery were made on both sides,&#xD;
with ninety-fifth trials of cases of " ancient-lights,"&#xD;
which all the lights of the bar could not render&#xD;
luminous, with the brilliant charges by the judge&#xD;
at the jury, and with the successive appeals to the&#xD;
obstinate twelfth man, Mr. Toplady was generally&#xD;
too tired for the first week to seek other amuse-&#xD;
ment in the evening than slumber. Finally,&#xD;
however, in passing an evening in Banks street,&#xD;
he was enabled to explain confidentially the&#xD;
events which had caused his temporary sojourn&#xD;
in the country; and we will give his narrative here&#xD;
as concisely as possible.&#xD;
"1You know, Moses," said he, "Mrs. Fasher-&#xD;
lidg e's affair was not quite so lively as I wished&#xD;
it : so I thought I would go to another one, the&#xD;
first of Colonel Sparks's, without you. Just to&#xD;
try it, and see whether their next would do for&#xD;
you. I went up to Sparks's and found a crowd&#xD;
of street idlers about the canvas passage at the&#xD;
door, making great sport of it. The winds were&#xD;
making sport of it too, for I could scarcely crawl&#xD;
through it. I got in, and in the dressing-room&#xD;
was personally affronted by the fellow presiding&#xD;
there, who objected to the color of my cravat,&#xD;
the scoundrel. However, he finally permitted&#xD;
me to go below, and I was announced, with a&#xD;
great flourish by the German musicians with their&#xD;
instruments. Sparks haa a great idea of these&#xD;
things, and has a little orchestra nest for his music&#xD;
up on the side of the wall, with a little door and&#xD;
secret passage-way and all that. Every guest&#xD;
that entered was trumpeted In this way, and it&#xD;
made some sensation to commence with. Sparks&#xD;
and his wife were seated in great solemnity like&#xD;
a king and queen, on a sort of raised dais at one&#xD;
end of the parlors. I was led up to them and&#xD;
paid my homage to them as if they really were&#xD;
regal personages, and so did all the others. And&#xD;
then they turned me loose upon society. I saw&#xD;
some people I knew, and was about going to&#xD;
them, when I heard the doorkeeper's voice again.&#xD;
' Mr. Joab Sackett, wholesale dealer in pins and&#xD;
needles, 67 Courtlandt street, no goods at retail.&#xD;
J. Sackett and lady,' he roared out.&#xD;
" Ha I ha I Sackett had made a mistake, and&#xD;
handed the faithful domestic his business card,&#xD;
and the fel1w read the whole of it ! I know&#xD;
Sackett very well. He is a thick-headed little fel-&#xD;
low,but his wife thinks a good deal of him, and they&#xD;
were very agreeable through the whole evening.&#xD;

he'd got out of some historical novel. le had&#xD;
obtained possession of a dish of mushrooms;&#xD;
and when Joab, who was looking for something,&#xD;
came along his way, he thrust the dishunder his&#xD;
nose, and I heard him say, 'Here, eat these.&#xD;
These are what you are looking for ;' and then,&#xD;
in an undertone, 'Very few constitutions can&#xD;
stand them; they'll made him darned sick!1'&#xD;
"'Oh! thank you,' Joab said looking up at&#xD;
him; 'wouldn't you like 'em ?'&#xD;
"' No, sir-r-r!' cried the other fiercely.&#xD;
"'1Hey?' said Joab starting; and here, if you&#xD;
had heard the encounter between them, you&#xD;
would have said the fellow was a fool. I vish I&#xD;
could remember the exact words he next mut-&#xD;
tered. It was something about there being in&#xD;
him the glorious promise of youth, beauty, and&#xD;
an opening future, and in Joab the hard reality&#xD;
of want, ugliness, ignominy, and despair; and ie&#xD;
wound up by saying, '0 gods of the difficult&#xD;
Delphos! I shrug my shoulders, ha! ha!'&#xD;
"'I beg pardon,' Joab replied. le was much&#xD;
confused by-this incomprehensible stuff.  'Can I&#xD;
do any thing for you? Has any thing disagreed&#xD;
with you?' asked he.&#xD;
"''Philosophers have argued for centuries!'&#xD;
the stranger went on as if he was in a soliloquy.&#xD;
'Let them turn to the revealed Logos for a solu-&#xD;
tion. To feel that this beautiful creature once&#xD;
loved me ! Be still, my soul!  Cool off,i my&#xD;
brain!  Is there no flux in our agony ?  Ha!&#xD;
ha! '  These were his very words, Moses; I&#xD;
remember them. Joab appeared in great com-&#xD;
passion, and asked hin again if he was unwell.&#xD;
' Ha! the proud ass's contumely!' continued the&#xD;
fellow in the same way, and then lie presently&#xD;
came personally at Joab: ' You conversed with&#xD;
her?' said he.&#xD;
"' Whom?' cried Joab.&#xD;
"'Miss Pottle.&#xD;
"'Yes,' said Joab, trying to ingratiate the&#xD;
stranger by slapping him on the back: 'she&#xD;
told me a story about one of the old gods run-&#xD;
ning off with a girl-' "&#xD;
" Jupiter and Semele, probably," interrupted&#xD;
Moses, laughing.&#xD;

imaginable, and it's for that very reason, his wife&#xD;
tries to make out he is talented and full of iis-&#xD;

of amusing himself by cheating at cards, or look-&#xD;
ing after othet women, or something else, when&#xD;
he hasn't the slightest idea of the sort. I noticed&#xD;
that long ago, when I first knew them. She&#xD;
wishes to have other women believe she has got&#xD;

know. Poor Joab, he is good-hearted, and is a&#xD;
fair business man, but that is about all. Well,&#xD;
he was conversing with Miss Pottle, and we could&#xD;
see him from the card-room. So Mrs. Sackett&#xD;
couldn't refrain from directing the attention of&#xD;
all of us toward him, and in a loud voice intimat-&#xD;

win Miss Pottle's affections, and she knew  it!&#xD;
While she was talking in tltis manner and feign-&#xD;
ing a desire to expose him on the spot to the&#xD;

cried the confused Susie.&#xD;
" R1odomontadel Iuch language now?&#xD;
Miss Susan ! can I-can I have been misled in m&#xD;
hopes by the child of my dear benefactor, by&#xD;
her whom I would thus save from false friends&#xD;

"Answer ine this question," said Susie, ener&#xD;
getically, " do you mean to say that you did not&#xD;
attempt to kiss my cheek in the oratory, the other&#xD;
day from other motives than interest in my&#xD;
father's wishes ?"&#xD;
"Other motives! Why, what other motives ?"&#xD;
asked the reverend gentleman, with a well-feigned&#xD;
air of painful astonishment. "But it is not you,&#xD;
no, not thc child of my pure friend that speaks.&#xD;
It is the baneful, maliynant influence of the false&#xD;
friends, new and old who are surrounding her&#xD;
with their worldly snares."&#xD;
"Do you mean to say, sir,' continued gasie in&#xD;
a rage, "that you have not sought this interview&#xD;
expressly to make love to me ?"&#xD;
"Your cruel, immodest insult is.refuted by the&#xD;
simple fact that I haven't, " replied the divine in&#xD;
triumph. " But oh ! enough I"&#xD;
Confound it, so you haven't," exploded&#xD;
Susie in bewilderment, "but you wished to,&#xD;
and-and now I see-you knew that, that there&#xD;
might be somebody concealed here in-"&#xD;
"Gracious heaven, somebody here who wil&#xD;
reveal my efforts to your father ! Who ! where!"&#xD;
exclaimed the other, with a well-affected start of&#xD;
consternation.&#xD;
" I am here, my dear friend !" said Mr. Tom.&#xD;
lins, coming forth from behind the shrubbery,&#xD;
and speaking in an agitated voice. "0 0ir ! I&#xD;
apologize for my position, but I do not regret&#xD;
it, for by it I have been enabled to see through&#xD;
the vile designs which would tear me from a&#xD;
noble man, a true Christian, from the best friend&#xD;
I have. My daughter, repair the injury you have&#xD;
attempted, by confessing your crime upon your&#xD;
knees before him, or you are no longer a daugh-&#xD;
ter of inn 1"&#xD;
"Stay !" cried Mr. Hunkyfell; "stay, Mr.&#xD;
Tomnlins, for my sake. I plead with you to stay&#xD;
your anger from your child. Oh! no, she can not&#xD;
wish to impute dishonor to me. She has but&#xD;
been led to err against her better nature, in her&#xD;
fatal attachment for an un worthy, cruel,malignant&#xD;
foe, Ah li I reo-the threat of ber lover's friend.&#xD;
Tush, it is but an imbecile conspiracy !"&#xD;
" What I Bunter's friend, this Winkfield, has&#xD;
threatened you!--and, you-you-" continued&#xD;
Mr. Tomlins, turning to his daughter, "you after&#xD;
lending yourself to this vile attempt, stand mute&#xD;
without a defense for your malice P"&#xD;
"I do not. I will defend my assertions, by&#xD;
asserting them again. Your noble mam, sincere&#xD;
Christian, and true friend, is a perjured, hard-&#xD;
cued traitor ! As for the facts, they are not&#xD;
plainer to me than his motives. But I won't say.&#xD;
&#xD;
t any more to or abont the Wretch ; and that is&#xD;
I- poz!"&#xD;
At this juncture, as Susie very properly burst&#xD;
nto a flood of tears, a sympathetic agitation ap-&#xD;
lm feared at once in the lid of a large tool-box&#xD;
standing at some distance from the scenejn the&#xD;
s conservatory. It opened half-way, shut down,&#xD;
- and then opened entirely, and there stood dis-&#xD;
l closed like a couple of jumping-jacks, two other&#xD;
parties interested in this matter, Mr. Bunter&#xD;
and Mr. Winkfield.   The latter chivalrously&#xD;
sought the side of Susie, while the former&#xD;
commenced to hase thuedivine about the al-&#xD;
y leys with a hoe, with which lie proposed to put&#xD;
him to death. He succeeded in knocking him&#xD;
, heavily upon the back by one smart blow, ere&#xD;
Moses by action, and Mr. Tomlins by adjuration,&#xD;
- arrested p4im. The noise at once attracted the&#xD;
cook from the kitchen-the serious footman, and&#xD;
r a pious house-maid from the table-setting and&#xD;
stolen love-making in the dining-room, and last,&#xD;
though not the least interested, as far as Moses&#xD;
was concerned, Aunt Jane from her boudoir. The&#xD;
divine recovered his equanimity, and the judi-&#xD;
cious use of his faculties from the presence of&#xD;
numbers and the threatened procuration of thme&#xD;
authorities by Mr. Tomnins ineae of a fresh out-&#xD;
break of the enemy's malignancy. His triumph&#xD;
was now about to be complete, an(l he seemed&#xD;
chiefly decirous of enjoying it o er our OKeeiVied&#xD;
hero, lie assumed, for that pleasing purpose, an&#xD;
air of magnanimity and Christian forgiveness,&#xD;
truly xasperatingto the latter.&#xD;
"My erring brother, let me forgive your fault,"&#xD;
he addressed Moses. " Yours is perhaps not so&#xD;
much that of moral obliquity as a mistaken view.&#xD;
Why, you are pale, sir ? The air within yonder&#xD;
receptacle must have been extremely unhealthful.&#xD;
I sincerely hope you have not risked your health&#xD;
by remaining there too long," continued ie with&#xD;
a tender, Christian solicitude, and agaii a humior-&#xD;
ous twinkle in his eye, meant for our poor her)o&#xD;
alone.&#xD;
" Mr. Tomlins, sir," said the latter, endeavor-&#xD;
ing to be as cool as possible, and addressing the&#xD;
deluded pater-familias for the first time, though&#xD;
at the sane time incidentally endeavoring to run&#xD;
through and transfix the hypocritical divine with&#xD;
a look; "the exposure of this personhas failed.&#xD;
I will not say by any other means than perhaps&#xD;
the low cunning, which is far removed-far me-&#xD;
moved from an intelligent sagacity, sir, and which&#xD;
could only have been foreseen in him, luy persons&#xD;
themselves accustomed to its base use!I"&#xD;
Young mai," replied Mr. Tonlins, 'I am not&#xD;
disposed to listen to accents of what I deem&#xD;
shameless if not criminal effrontery'I&#xD;
" Allow me to observe," continued the bravo&#xD;
but unsuccessful Moses, blushing to the crown of&#xD;
his head, " that I hold those who by prejudice aro&#xD;
blinded to proceedings MagainAt themclives of&#xD;
wicked men, whom they have an opportunity of&#xD;
justly punishing, deserve, if not reprehiension, at&#xD;

awarded in this matter-"&#xD;
".Brazen adventurer and reviler of virtuous&#xD;
men !" exclaimed Mi. Tombuhis, "leave my-"&#xD;
"hold, my dear friend," interrupted Mr. Hun-&#xD;
kyfell. " Let us seek, like Christians, this op-&#xD;

ample of meet forgiveness. Let uis embrace them,&#xD;
let us receive them into our confidence, give them&#xD;
our advice, and lead them up to a triumphant re-&#xD;
nunciation of their errors-a sweet, sweet return&#xD;
of good for evil."&#xD;
"1Hear this !" exclaimed Mr. Tomlins, much&#xD;
affected. "Perverse creature, could you find it&#xD;
in N our heart to wrong such virtue ?"&#xD;
"Madam!" said Moses, now philosophically&#xD;
turning to Aunt Jane. "I acknowledge that&#xD;
the glance of reason can never be sufficient, un-&#xD;
ailed, to direct us in every part of our conduct.&#xD;
When it is not stifled by our own passions, it is&#xD;
misled by the deceptions of others. In particu-&#xD;
lar do I think some portion of providential grace&#xD;
is necessary in this cas, by heaven !"&#xD;
"Ye., and oh 1 won't you please repent, sir ?"&#xD;
replied Aunt Jane in timid excitement. "For my&#xD;
sake-for one who to win you from error, is&#xD;
willing to avow that she would reciprocate the&#xD;
tender-"&#xD;
" I beg pardon," said Moses, as the lady hesi-&#xD;
tated, " you were about to observe-"&#xD;
"That I would reciprocate your love, dear&#xD;
youth, were you only a member of the glorious&#xD;
band !" murmured the fragile girl in a sweet&#xD;
reluctant whisper to him.&#xD;
"tHeavens ! wiat a misfortune. Madam, you&#xD;
mistake-you are entirely mistaken !" Moses,&#xD;
vehemently whispered back.&#xD;
The lady sat down involuntarily upon an orange-&#xD;
tree box, and shut her eyes as she heard the fital&#xD;
truth. Hr senses swam, and she fell into mo-&#xD;
mentary insensibility.&#xD;
" I hope, Mr. Winkfield," said the shrewd&#xD;
divine, " though my friend Mr. Tomlins still re-&#xD;
mains inexorable, that I shall meet with you&#xD;
again. I see not only that you possess high&#xD;
talents, but that thee are many virtues in your&#xD;
character, which I think might be strengthened&#xD;
by ny exhortations and advice !"&#xD;
" And a constant contemplation of your in-&#xD;
fernal example. Allow me to observe that you&#xD;
are a rascal, and that any body is a pitiable mole&#xD;
who after five minutes' conversation with you&#xD;
can think otherwise. I am perfectly cool, sir,&#xD;
else I should be tempted to violate the laws of&#xD;
decorum by inflicting upon your person a severe&#xD;
punishment, a very severe punishment. As it is,&#xD;
my selfrespect compels me to leave your presence.&#xD;
Until the scales of prejudice shall have dropped&#xD;
from the eyes of your patron, I fear that justice&#xD;
will be shielded from you through him I"&#xD;
"Young man !" said Mr. Tomlins here, "you&#xD;
can now leave this house. I have already for-&#xD;
bidden my disobedient daughter from receiving&#xD;
the visits of Bunter. I now plainly tell her, if&#xD;
she has a future interview, either with principal&#xD;
or accomplice in this vicious plot, I disown her&#xD;
forever !"!&#xD;
"Never mind, Tom. Never mind, Mr. Wink-&#xD;
field !" here cried Susie cheerfully. " If papa&#xD;
continues to make a ninny of himself, that won't&#xD;
prevent ultimate justice being done. I think you&#xD;
had better go now. I am sick of the whole&#xD;
thing, and am going to dinner."&#xD;
Our hero fatally lingered in his honest efforts&#xD;
to emancipate this worthy family from the toils&#xD;
of deception. In the first place, he attempted to&#xD;
be classically satirical, by reciting a Johnsonian&#xD;
allegory, containing gods and goddesses, upon&#xD;
the subtlety of hypocrisy. In this he was sternly&#xD;
&#xD;
rebuked ere he finished, by Mr. Tomlhin, for add.&#xD;
ing to his other enormities a frivolous and vain&#xD;
display of a knowledge of profane fiction. He&#xD;
then wildly attempted to continue his efforts by&#xD;
making an unsupported assertion that the ebap-&#xD;
lain had deliberately and unblushingly bargained&#xD;
with him, as the party of the second part's agent,&#xD;
to sell his consent to Mr. Bunter's union with&#xD;
Miss Tomlins for the sum of twenty thousand&#xD;
dollars.&#xD;
At this, by the immediate orders -f the irre-&#xD;
coverably exasperated head of the family, and&#xD;
although Aunt Jane faintly protested,and both our&#xD;
hero and the unhappy Bunt-r struggled manfully,&#xD;
they were dismissed in disgace, and with irre-&#xD;
sistible violence, through the side- gate, by the&#xD;
combined efforts of the three male domestics of&#xD;
the house, aided by the Dutch grocer and, his&#xD;
boy, who turned traitors to Bunter at the last&#xD;
moment, from fear of losing the patronage of the&#xD;
house.&#xD;
" By Jove, it is just what we expected to have&#xD;
done to the reverend rascal " ejaculated Moses,&#xD;
as they walked away.&#xD;
" So it is !" said Mr. Bunter, struck with the&#xD;
idea.&#xD;
"It is singular ! The dispensations of Provi-&#xD;
dence, I must say, are very singular-very singu-&#xD;
lar indeed. But, my dear boy, we did the best&#xD;
we could," continued Moses. "And things are&#xD;
perhaps not much worse off than they were be-&#xD;
fore, eh ?"&#xD;
" No, perhaps they are not," said Mr. Bunter&#xD;
dubiously.&#xD;
" And mind you, Bunter, whenever you want&#xD;
my aid, send for inc at once, though not just at&#xD;
present. Perhaps it would not be judicious just&#xD;
now."&#xD;
The grateful but unhappy Bunter heartily&#xD;
thanked Moses for what lie had done, though he&#xD;
seemed compelled to acknowledge the propriety&#xD;
of the latter's opinion of the situation.&#xD;
"Smar t fellow, that Hunk) fell !" said he.&#xD;
"Very," replied Moses.      V.&#xD;
"How did he find out what we were up to ?"&#xD;
asked Bunter, in curiosity.&#xD;
" By his infernal cunning, by his infamous&#xD;
craftiness "' replied Moses, vainly efndeavoring to&#xD;
longer repress his anger. "It is my intention,&#xD;
Bunter, it is my intention, by heaven, to----to&#xD;
soundly thrash that gentleman the next time I&#xD;
meet with him, no matter where it.is !"&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
THE COUNT AND COUNTESS HETHERINGTON.&#xD;
TaE 0yotg people, Mr. and Mrs. Hetherington,&#xD;
with wvhom Moses lodged, were a singularly un-&#xD;
sophisticated couple. They formed what judg-&#xD;
ment they had of men and things from the impos-&#xD;
sible situations, absurd -creatures, and exagger-&#xD;
ated sentiment which are the attractions of sen-&#xD;
sational romance and the gag of the stage. A&#xD;
rational maiden aunt residing at a convenient&#xD;
distance in the country, supplied them with what&#xD;
money and sense they needed for the ordinary&#xD;
purposes of life, and they were thus enabled to&#xD;
pass their hours in all sorts of illusions. He was&#xD;
laboring under the hallucination that lie was&#xD;

ness part of the city, and she that she was house&#xD;
keeping by intrusting her household to an ene&#xD;
getic Irish girl  "0 happy innocence of yout&#xD;
and happy young love !" was Moses's reflection&#xD;
while playing at all-fours and drinkihtg tea wit'&#xD;
them one evening in their parlor. What though&#xD;
the wife at times would put on infantile manner&#xD;
and nestle in her husband's lap, or the lord, o&#xD;
the contrary, assume a parental air, or cithie&#xD;
would drink out of the other's cup, or he would&#xD;
kiss her scissors, or she the cracked flute lie ha!&#xD;
been attempting a wheezy melody upon, or woulc&#xD;
produce his picture and passionately contemplat&#xD;
it, if lie happened to leave the room temporarily&#xD;
what though these and other tender little scene.&#xD;
between them  somewhat disturbed our hero'E&#xD;
feeling as a conservative philosopher; he never&#xD;
theless enjoyed himself hugely In their society&#xD;
from very sympathy with virtue and innocence&#xD;
In his enthusiasm, he gallantly descanted upon&#xD;
his young host's manly intelligence, and upon hi;&#xD;
hostess's amiable loveliness, indulging in littl&#xD;
complimentary turns of wit, generously subdued&#xD;
to the capacity of their appreciation.&#xD;
"Ai !" said he to Mr. Hetherington, with&#xD;
whom he was playing, while the wife was leaning&#xD;
over her husband's shoulder and fondling him&#xD;
carelessly about his head and ears. "Ah ! the&#xD;
queen of hearts I Yes, fortune has given he&#xD;
to you in this game, and in life too-the queen&#xD;
of all hearts!"-&#xD;
With this heavy inanity, he looked at the&#xD;
lady, who immediately returned a gratified look,&#xD;
and treated him to the sight-of a seemingly un&#xD;
-conscious kisq imprinted upon the cow-lick in&#xD;
the crown of her lord's head.&#xD;
"Have you ever noticed, Mr. Hetherington,'&#xD;
continue the benevolent Moses, making another&#xD;
gallant effort, "how much your wife's nose re-&#xD;
sembles-that of the Greek slave ?"&#xD;
"You don't say so ?" said the young husband,&#xD;
gazing in rapture at-that organ of his loved spouse.&#xD;
" What a wondrous triumph is that illustrious&#xD;
work of art," continued Moses, rendered a little&#xD;
shaky in his principles against flattery, by the&#xD;
sight of the pleasure lie was giving. "Not a&#xD;
feature but is the ideal of artistic perfection."&#xD;
The wife here furtively glanced a woman's&#xD;
glance at the mirror, looked again gratifiedly at&#xD;
Moses, and then to round off the situation, play-&#xD;
fully pulled her husband's nasal organ.&#xD;
"Don't. You hurt !" said the latter, affecting&#xD;
severe pain.&#xD;
Here a short row was improvised for the pur-&#xD;
pose of a lengthy reconciliation. The latter was&#xD;
of such an extremely tender nature, that Moses&#xD;
felt compelled to make a diversion.&#xD;
"Hark ! I thought I heard the fire-bells. No.&#xD;
Never mind V" concluded he, after feigning to&#xD;
listen, "I was mistaken.   By the way, we&#xD;
haven't finished the rub, Mr. Hetherington."&#xD;
" And, Mr. Winkfield, suppose my wife plays&#xD;
with me against you ? Mollie, you can sit upon&#xD;
half my chair," replied Mr. Hetherington.&#xD;
"Oh ! that will be so cosy !" exclaimed Mollie.&#xD;
"Certainly, certainly," replied Moses, smiling&#xD;
pleasantly. ("Such tenderness!")&#xD;
"hIm this way you will sit more easily, Mollic,"&#xD;
contined Lord Hetherington, putting his arm&#xD;
around his countess. " Is my cheek too rough&#xD;
against yours ? It is unshaven to-day."&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD,&#xD;
&#xD;
ii-  "Darling !" whispered the wife in low sariness,&#xD;
e- " the cheek of my darling husband! "&#xD;
r-   By a slight snort the husband relieved himself&#xD;
h of the oppression of his temporary ecstasy at this&#xD;
i, exhibition of his wife's microscopic devotion,&#xD;
h and by resuming the play, relieved Moses of a&#xD;
h powerful premonition that lie would be called&#xD;
s, upon to hear more fire-bells shortly.&#xD;
n    "Your aunt lives at Waterbury, Mr. Hether-&#xD;
r ington ?" inquired Moses confidentially.&#xD;
d    " Yes. She advised us to let one floor to have&#xD;
d a little society in the evenings. We thought of&#xD;
d a lady and gentleman, but we think we are for-&#xD;
e tunate in securing you; (don't we, Mollie?)&#xD;
Not that we are at all tired of each other's so-&#xD;
a eety and wish others, but-"&#xD;
s   "Tired .of each other' society !" exclaimed&#xD;
the wife, with a tender reproachful look again at&#xD;
her husband. "0 Rainsford I the thought !"&#xD;
.   "But what I mean, dear, is, that it is pleasant&#xD;
to have some one drop in at times, you know." -&#xD;
s   " 01,! yes. Yes. To be sure ; and envy us.&#xD;
e Of course, certainly," said the wife recovering.&#xD;
I   "And when aunt comes down, it will be so&#xD;
pleasant for her to meet you, Mr. Winkfield!"&#xD;
" And it will be a pleasure to me to meet her,&#xD;
sir," continued our hero impressively.  "A&#xD;
pleasure additional to that which I now expe-&#xD;
rience as an observer and man of the world in&#xD;
r witnessing, and as a friend I hope I may say, in&#xD;
sharing the exquisite harmony and happiness of&#xD;
her young relative's household."&#xD;
2!  "Mr. Winkfield, we entertain a great esteem&#xD;
for you, sir; " said Mr. Hetherington impulsively.&#xD;
- " And I thought after all it was better you&#xD;
were a single gentleman of leisure," joined in the&#xD;
wife in an overflow of confidence, "as, being&#xD;
some older than Rainsford, you might more will-&#xD;
ingly take walks with him, and kindly give him&#xD;
advicein his business operations."&#xD;
" Those that I shall shortly enter intoI!" ex-&#xD;
plained the husband.&#xD;
" I will, madam 1" exclaimed our hero, rising&#xD;
in enthusiasm. "I feel it my duty, and your hus-&#xD;
band may consider me as a business friend and&#xD;
commercial brother!!"&#xD;
With this happy arrangement, a game of coup-&#xD;
gorqe euchre was substituted for the single game,&#xD;
which, however, was presently interrupted by&#xD;
the rules of the game compelling Hethering-&#xD;
ton to cruelly aid and abet Mr. Winkfield in&#xD;
beating the countess, thereby causing the latter&#xD;
to burst into a copious rain of conjugal som-row.&#xD;
After holding out for about ten minutes, she&#xD;
granted her repentant husband's earnest suppli-&#xD;
cations for forgiveness, during which Moses inge-&#xD;
niously saved himself the necessity of starting&#xD;
another alarm of fire by undertaking a long&#xD;
apology, thinking that one was due from some-&#xD;
body for the occurrence of the scene.&#xD;
The game was then renewed and continued&#xD;
with partial success, several more sensational&#xD;
epochs occurring during the evening. At last&#xD;
Moses, having heard three additional alarms of&#xD;
fire, two altercations in the street, one knock at&#xD;
the door, and seen three spiders, retired for the&#xD;
night to his own room. He had enjoyed himself&#xD;
much, and he resolved to visit them, fi-equently&#xD;
and give them his advice.&#xD;
"It will be a pleasure. They evidently have&#xD;
taken a fancy for me, a great fancy, amid seek&#xD;
my friendship. Anid they shall have it I&#xD;

&#xD;
be inclined to look upon the institution as a de-&#xD;
cided enemy to at least one ,-hich they generally&#xD;
prize, the time-honored inwitution of marriage.&#xD;
" Hallo, there goes Dobbin's wife! Ha! ha!&#xD;
Did you ever see such A change in a man ? What&#xD;
a poke he used to be. But she drove him abso-&#xD;
lutely to join us. The poor fellow didn't wish to,&#xD;
at all. Domestic, you know, fond of children.&#xD;
But he's over that. Spends most of his, time&#xD;
here, and is transformed into a regular butterfly,&#xD;
sad dog."&#xD;
Moses reflected that Mrs. Dobbin ought cer-&#xD;
tainly to be a satisfied woman, and was turning&#xD;
to conceal any little doubtful expression of coun-&#xD;
tenance which his thoughts might give rise to,&#xD;
when his vision was met by what seemed to him,&#xD;
to be a gorgeous expression of the fine art of&#xD;
dressing.  It was a young    man, a   youth&#xD;
who might truly be designated as the very&#xD;
perfection of the fashion.  That very morn-&#xD;
ing the gentleman had risen early and expended&#xD;
several closely reflective hours, in examining at a&#xD;
proper distance the genius which had been&#xD;
thrown into the breeches he now wore. A re-&#xD;
tirement for deeper study and thorough analysis&#xD;
of the lines of beauty displayed in an accompany-&#xD;
ing coat,-had occupied the heart of the day. An&#xD;
hour of the afternoon had been devoted to a con-&#xD;
sultation with his man upon the proper means of&#xD;
getting into the whole establishment without'&#xD;
marring any of its effect, and finally the sunset&#xD;
hour saw him successfully robed in these rare&#xD;
habiliments, and the dying day was glad to be&#xD;
faintly reflected in their glorious lustre ere it&#xD;
gave up the ghost of its existence. He stood be-&#xD;
fore our hero an astonishing apparition, himself&#xD;
astonished at the wonder of his own creating.&#xD;
He looked at our hero for a short moment. It&#xD;
was but to survey his nether habiliments. A slight&#xD;
faint -smile expanded upon his countenance, and&#xD;
lie turned away. A smile of pity and compassion&#xD;
for the unhappy Moses, one of contempt and&#xD;
scorn for his breeches.&#xD;
Moses again directed his attention to the old&#xD;
gallant, who now proceeded to entertain himself,&#xD;
and those about him with a minute relation of a&#xD;
deeply interesting story 'of real life which had&#xD;
happened during the earlier years of his existence,&#xD;
the hero of which was one of his intimate friends&#xD;
and in which lie himself was subordinately involved.&#xD;
The glorious triumph of this interesting friend&#xD;
appeared to have consisted principally, inthe so-&#xD;
duction of a young and foolish married lady, and&#xD;
incidentally in the murder of her husband, and the&#xD;
breaking of both her parents' hearts.&#xD;
"And he was hanged, of course ?" asked our&#xD;
hero, apparently making a humorous attempt at&#xD;
indignation.&#xD;
"Eh?    Ha! ha!    Pretty good.  Ranged?&#xD;
No. He'll be here soon. He is a glorious fellow.&#xD;
Very popular. If you will wait a little while, I&#xD;
will introduce him to you. You never saw such&#xD;
a facetious old dog as he is! Dry, sir! Dry, as&#xD;
sherry or an old maid's bones !"&#xD;
Our hero felt, no doubt, that if there was as&#xD;
much dry humor displayed in this glorious indi-&#xD;
vidual's remarks as his actions, his conversation&#xD;
might be as effective as Professor Holmes's first&#xD;
attempt at being funny was upon the compositors.&#xD;
So he did not wait to be introduced ; but walked&#xD;
away to another room under the delieatc pretense&#xD;
of seeking his friend, who had temporarily ab-&#xD;
&#xD;
seated himself for a little consultant, with the&#xD;
head cook, intended to be highly advantagu~i,5 to&#xD;
both Moses and himself.s&#xD;
Here he was. occasioned a little surprise, by an&#xD;
attenuated elderly gentleman, of highly respect-&#xD;
able appearance, but still with an unhappy rest-&#xD;
less air, as though something unconcluded was&#xD;
weighing upon his mind, requesting with a polite&#xD;
apology a few moments of private conversation.&#xD;
Moses walked with him to a window.&#xD;
" Do you intend to marry her ?" said the&#xD;
stranger, in a low voice.&#xD;
"What! whom ?" said Moses, in confusion.&#xD;
" The sister of the man with big legs and&#xD;
whiskers," continued the stranger, with weak&#xD;
accents.&#xD;
"You mistake, sir!   You are directing to&#xD;
me an inquiry undoubtedly meant for some other&#xD;
party," replied Moses in astonishment.&#xD;
" Oh! Oh! I beg pardon. The room is dark&#xD;
and indistinct. Excuse me !" continued the gen-&#xD;
tleman, "I thought you were the party."&#xD;
" Certainly !" said Moses politely.&#xD;
" She ought to be married at any rate. It is a&#xD;
duty the party owes to other people if not to&#xD;
her," muttered the other with a dissatisfied air&#xD;
and still eyeing Moses, as he walked away.&#xD;
Moses was so much struck with this brief in-&#xD;
terruption that he appealed to his friend when&#xD;
he returned for information upon it.&#xD;
"Oh ! didn't you know him? Why, that is Spen-&#xD;
cey.  The fact of it is," replied his friend&#xD;
shortly, "he is a little touched in his cranium.&#xD;
Only a little, though, and solely upon this sub-&#xD;
ject. We don't mind him. But really, the cause&#xD;
of his state of mind is so singular, I must tell it&#xD;
to you."&#xD;
" Do so," said Moses, quite interested.&#xD;
"He was going home from the Club-House at&#xD;
a late hour one evening, when he was followed&#xD;
from its door until he reached'Union Park, by a&#xD;
carriage and two unknown men walking upon the&#xD;
pavement behind him, When lie had gained the&#xD;
Park pavement, the carriage stopped at a short&#xD;
distance ahead of him, the men violently seized&#xD;
him, forced him into it, and stifling all opportu-&#xD;
nity to use his vocal organs, ears, or vision, drove&#xD;
off. After they stopped and Spencey had par-&#xD;
tially recovered from the insensibility, which had&#xD;
been caused by fright and the stuffed bag into&#xD;
which they had inserted his head, he found him-&#xD;
self being made to enter a building which he im-&#xD;
mediately felt to be a church, and presently he&#xD;
knew that he was standing before its altar. A light&#xD;
was ordered to be turned on in a low voice, a&#xD;
hand was placed in his, and upon the stuffed bag&#xD;
being removed from his head, he discovered him-&#xD;
self in an unknown sanctuary, standing before a&#xD;
clergyman in vestments, with an unknown female&#xD;
in agitation by his side, and another and older&#xD;
female in equal agitation supporting her, while two&#xD;
other gentlemen were seated at a short distance.&#xD;
"'You know the meaning of this. Refuse to&#xD;
go on with the ceremony, sir- and you die!' whis-&#xD;
pered a large man with large whiskers, in the af-&#xD;
frighted Spencey's left car, and furtively pressing&#xD;
the muzzle of a pistol behind it.&#xD;
"In all human probability, though a-bachelor&#xD;
of many years' confirmation, he would in two&#xD;
inoi'e minutes have been irrevocably married to a&#xD;
female, whom he had never seen before and who&#xD;
was also not remarkably attractive, if the down-&#xD;

cast ar 7orithe convulsed bride, had not been&#xD;
e      directed to his legs, (you observed,&#xD;
he hadrather thin ones,) and thus to his face.&#xD;
She gave a subdued shriek, murmured, 'It is not&#xD;
he l' and fell in insensibility upon the pavement,&#xD;
and amid the confusion incident upon the discov-&#xD;
ery she had made, Spencey followed her example.&#xD;
When he recovered, he found himself being eject-&#xD;
ed from a hack in an obscure street as forcibly as&#xD;
he had been made to enter it, and while restoring&#xD;
his ill-used person to an erect posture, he observed&#xD;
it driving away in the distance. He ran wildly&#xD;
about, found the avenue to his residence, reached&#xD;
the latter, put himself to bed, and after a week's&#xD;
delirium, rose from the same, with his wits per-&#xD;
manently disordered, at least as far as the neces-&#xD;
sity of this unknown girl's marriage is presented&#xD;
to him in connection with his own future peace&#xD;
of mind."&#xD;
" That is the most extraordinary adventure I&#xD;
ever heard of," exclaimed Moses, striking the&#xD;
table before him emphatically.&#xD;
" He wisely conjectures it was some fellow con-&#xD;
nected with the Club, whom they were after, but&#xD;
very irrationally imagines strangers whom he&#xD;
meets here, to be the derelict person ! Hence&#xD;
came his mistake in approaching you."&#xD;
"Well, that incident is extremely singular,"&#xD;
reiterated Moses.&#xD;
" The parties had either imbibed too strongly&#xD;
for the occasion, or their faculties of perception&#xD;
had been unjointed by their excitement. Unluck-&#xD;
ily for him, the mystery has riever been solved.&#xD;
The parties undoubtedly were frightened with&#xD;
their own violence, or else knew it would be of&#xD;
no use to attempt to find the real fellow. They've&#xD;
never been heard of. But let's to dinner."&#xD;
And thereupon' Moses accompanieVl his enter-&#xD;
tainer to the dining-room. After casually observ-&#xD;
ing a youthful gentleman who having been&#xD;
abroad, was endeavoring to give tone to-the es-&#xD;
tablishment, by dining as he had seen it done&#xD;
in England, to wit, by taking a chop and a pint&#xD;
of sherry, reading the afternoon journal, looking&#xD;
languid and observing the effect of the whole on&#xD;
the spectators, and also after observing another&#xD;
young gentleman, who was introducing the fash-&#xD;
ion as he had seen it, to wit, getting very drunk&#xD;
and going to sleep over his chop, newspaper, and&#xD;
sherry, Moses proceeded to and through a dinner&#xD;
which certainlydid honor to the regulations of&#xD;
the fastidious committee, and which he felt a&#xD;
modern Gil Blas would have pronounced worthy&#xD;
of Dr. Spring, Tyng, McCloskey, Bellows, or any&#xD;
of the present hierarchy. When the repast was&#xD;
finished, he enjoyed the further facilities whic&#xD;
the Club furnished for the amusement of its fre&#xD;
quenters in the form of "the Club" game of&#xD;
whist at sixpence point, that being well known&#xD;
as the maximum stake allowed in the establish&#xD;
ment. With his usual impetuous enthusiasm in&#xD;
matters which could afford pleasure to thosE&#xD;
around him, he here entered fully into the spirit&#xD;
of this curious game, and after a prolongation of&#xD;
the amusement for two hours, discovered upor&#xD;
rising from the table for the purpose of partakinE&#xD;
of a lobster salad, that he had lost four dollar&#xD;
and been fined four hundred and twenty for va&#xD;
rious violations of the game. He was surprised ti&#xD;
observe though it struck him as a very common&#xD;
dious arrangement, that this matter of fining wa&#xD;
intrusted to the members at play themselves, an&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
that during the %vening the rules of the institu-&#xD;
tion were being ctestantly vindicated by weighty&#xD;
penalties enforced 'ty these parties upon each&#xD;
other. He now joined again in the conversation&#xD;
and although many disputes arose therein, in con-&#xD;
sequence perhaps, of the consumption of too&#xD;
much unnecessary wine, he saw that they were&#xD;
politely confined to mere logomachy by a -ery&#xD;
curious but highly laudable practice among the&#xD;
members-a practice, which appeared to be an-&#xD;
other rule of the institution for preserving its re-&#xD;
putation for high tone, consisting in both parties&#xD;
promptly challenging each other and then in-&#xD;
stantly withdrawing their warlike notes. As&#xD;
many as five of these interesting exchanges took&#xD;
place during his presence there. As to the style&#xD;
of conversation, he speedily became aware that&#xD;
the entertaining topics which had been discussed&#xD;
before dinner were very popular ones in the es-&#xD;
tablishment.&#xD;
Although several old merchants now and then&#xD;
endeavored to bring upon the tapis the public&#xD;
events of the day, or sequestered themselves at&#xD;
times in small knots for a quiet discussion of a&#xD;
punch and commercial matters, it was observable&#xD;
sooner or later that the entire assemblage swam&#xD;
in the more vivacious channels of thought,- the&#xD;
scandal of the day; and those who hadn't much&#xD;
to say, listened to what others said about every&#xD;
body's wife or mistress, horses, dogs, or servants.&#xD;
He became bewildered, and toward midnight&#xD;
he rushed from the establishment, resolved,&#xD;
among other things, to destroy the peace of the&#xD;
first quiet family he could get at. In the morn-&#xD;
ing the result of his few reflections upon the in.&#xD;

Whether his previous views thereon in other re-&#xD;

necessary for us to state.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXL&#xD;
AN UNSATIsFACTORY ONE TO MOsES,&#xD;
Mosgs had noiw become quite intimate with Mr.&#xD;
Wagbull's excellent family. Though the old lady&#xD;
still kept up her mysterious propensity to view&#xD;
h;m with disfavor, he nevertheless managed, by&#xD;
his propitiatory conduct, to prevent her aggres-&#xD;
sive movements from  coming to violence and&#xD;
blows. When, however, upon his last afternoon&#xD;
call, he imagined he observed a coldness and re-&#xD;
serve in the manner of her granddaughter, he&#xD;
was suddenly reminded there might possibly oc-&#xD;
cur more disagreeable results of the ancestral in-&#xD;
- fluence, than if the old lady should be led to in-&#xD;
sert a sharp instrument in a vital portion of his&#xD;
person, or to scatter the physical nest of his&#xD;
t mind with a fire-arm. He looked earnestly at&#xD;
Miss Wagbull for the moment, as if to descry the&#xD;
1 cause of the barometer's fall, and asked her&#xD;
dubiously if her grandmother was well.&#xD;
S    "Oh ! yes, sir," replied the young lady.&#xD;
"But are-are you a little indisposed yourself,&#xD;
o Miss Bessie ?" continued Moses lugubriously.&#xD;
- V ou are scai cely in your usual spirits to-day,&#xD;
stare you ?" ,&#xD;
d" Oh ! yes, sir," replied Bessie, appearing to&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
51&#xD;
&#xD;
make a momentary effort, and immediately re-&#xD;
lapsing into conversational incapacity.&#xD;
"But you are engaged now ?" continued Moses&#xD;
deferentially. " And shall I-"&#xD;
"Oh ! no, sir," replied she.&#xD;
"How cold the weather is again!" continued&#xD;
Moses after a pause.&#xD;
" Oh ! yes, sir.-&#xD;
"It is very disagreeable, very, outside. Have&#xD;
you been out to-day, Miss Bessie ?"&#xD;
" Oh! no-that is, I mean yes. Yes, sir," re-&#xD;
plied she.&#xD;
Here there was another pause, in which the&#xD;
young lady courteously endeavored, by trifling&#xD;
with her watchguard, to appear at ease, and too&#xD;
evidently failed thereat.&#xD;
"**see the Huguenots is to be performed on&#xD;
Wednesday night," continued the perplexed Mo-&#xD;
ses, hunting in vain for some conflagrating sub-'&#xD;
ject.&#xD;
"Y es-yes, it is."&#xD;
"You will go, of course."&#xD;
"Oh ! yes, sir.-"&#xD;
"By heaven, but the role of Valentine is very&#xD;
dramatic; do you not think so, Miss Wagbull ?!&#xD;
"Oh! yes, sir," replied the young lady. Here&#xD;
she made a great effort and added, "Very, very&#xD;
much so."&#xD;
The tremendous length of this remark, under&#xD;
the circumstances, encouraged Moses so much,&#xD;
that he immediately exclaimed with an air of en-&#xD;
thusiasm, " And won't you sing rPlus blanche que&#xD;
"a blanche hOhn!ine for me, Bessie ."&#xD;
"Oh! yes. Yes, I will."&#xD;
"But mind you, don't sing if you feel at all&#xD;
disinclined. I would not ask you against your&#xD;
wishes, you know, never, Bessie. That is, if you&#xD;
are not in voice to-night, or-you are not in voice&#xD;
to-night ." asked he vehemently.&#xD;
"Oh! no; that is, I really fear I am not."&#xD;
The song was not sung, and the conversation&#xD;
continued for almost an half-hour longer in the&#xD;
same brilliant style, which the young lady varied&#xD;
slightly, however, by two or three confused- at-&#xD;
tempts to excuse herself for inattention and ab-&#xD;
straction, thereby rendering the situation much&#xD;
more awkward. Unable to dispel the too evident&#xD;
peculiarity in her manner, Moses finally made a&#xD;
desperate effort, and tore himself away in an un-&#xD;
sati fled state.&#xD;
"Yes, sir, and no, sir! Confound it, what does&#xD;
she mean by that ? It is either the grandmother&#xD;
or dullness, and I will visit some place of amuse-&#xD;
ment."&#xD;
Moses was never more mistaken inhis life. It&#xD;
was not the grandmother, nor did the young lady&#xD;
feel at all dull. On the contrary, she felt unusu-&#xD;
ally strong emotions that afternoon, and on his&#xD;
account, too. The fact was, that during the&#xD;
morning, she had visited Stewart's, and upqn&#xD;
driving down a by-street, near the Fourth avenue,&#xD;
she saw him looking hastily around while in the&#xD;
not of making up to an old rheumatic negro with&#xD;
charity in his hand. She was much affected by&#xD;
the look of gratitude upon the useless darkey's&#xD;
face, but she could not help laughing at the ab-&#xD;
surd air with which the ridiculous Moses feigned&#xD;
to abusively order off the ancient mendicant&#xD;
as some one approached them. The act lent her&#xD;
estimate of his character such dignity, that it had&#xD;
momentarily scared her from the pleasant terms&#xD;
of friendship into the fiekd of terrible respect,&#xD;
&#xD;
To dissipate the impressions of her demonstra-&#xD;
tion thereof, and at the same time to improve his&#xD;
knowledge of the real world and the refined&#xD;
amusements which is afforded to the student of&#xD;
the ideal one, by the ingenious appliances of stage&#xD;
paint and machinery, he proceeded in the evening&#xD;
with Mr. Titman to witness a representation of&#xD;
the Lady of Lyons.&#xD;
Mr. Titman was much impressed with the&#xD;
characters and the audience, the manner in which&#xD;
the orchestra crawled in from beneath the stage,&#xD;
the introductory tasting of his instrument by the&#xD;
clarionet-player, the wrestling with and final per-&#xD;
pendicular erection of the double-base, by the lit-&#xD;
tle old musician with spectacles and snuffy nose,&#xD;
and the dignified assumption of the musical&#xD;
throne by the smiling leader. His absorption in&#xD;
the play itself was shown in the fidelity with&#xD;
which he followed the various expressions upon&#xD;
the actors' faces, with similar ones upon his own,&#xD;
and their gestures by sympathetic reflections.&#xD;
Upon one occasion, when one of the exercised&#xD;
characters started convulsively from his seat with&#xD;
a forcible gesticulation, Mr. Titman also jumped&#xD;
up, with one sufficient to alarm a consumptive&#xD;
gentleman in frout of him, attract the eyes of&#xD;
many of the audience, and arouse the vigilance&#xD;
of the policeman in attendance. By these pecu-&#xD;
harities of the susceptible Dibbletowyer augment-&#xD;
ed by the eccentricity with which a 'a rentle-&#xD;
man seated near by manifested his appreciate.&#xD;
of the melodrama, Moses's ardent endeavors to&#xD;
imbibe the true sentiment of the romantic play&#xD;
were rendered quite sterile and unavailing. This&#xD;
party, though evidently not subject to the weak-&#xD;
ness of pathos, still had a manner of his own of&#xD;
enjoying the play. Every thing in it was unmiti-&#xD;
gatedly funny to him, except, perhaps, the scenes&#xD;
which the distinguished author intended to be&#xD;
such. From the commencement of the evolution&#xD;
of the tender element, he indulged in ill-controlled&#xD;
ecstasies of laughter, and the perspiration rolled&#xD;
from his brow in his efforts to subdue to decorum&#xD;
his visible agitation thereat. When the eloquent&#xD;
description of the young horticulturist's imagin.&#xD;
ative Alpine home was reached, the old gentleman&#xD;
was unable to control his peculiar appreciation of&#xD;
the play any longer. With an emphatic and au-&#xD;
dible utterance of a very vulgar but popular word,&#xD;
expressive of a profound sense of the ridiculous,&#xD;
he rose, and being kindly assisted from the house&#xD;
by the knightly bearer of the locust, soon reached&#xD;
the street, in which the noise of his continued ex-&#xD;
plosions might be heard dying away, as he gradu-&#xD;
ally receded in the distance.  This distraction,&#xD;
together with the annoyance caused by the per-&#xD;
sistence with which a facetious party in the gal-&#xD;
lery above him continued to drop programmes,&#xD;
orange-peel, and other little valueless articles upon&#xD;
his head, and also the proximity of a gentleman&#xD;
behind him, who was partial in his repasts to that&#xD;
fragrant vegetable, the onion, rendered the even-&#xD;
ing, whether considered in the light of an emo-&#xD;
tional exercise with the sentimental muse, or as&#xD;
a philosophic one of critical observation, entirely&#xD;
unsuccessful and barren in its results upon our&#xD;
hero's being. This compels us, in consequence,&#xD;
to close this chapter without any particular illus.&#xD;
trations of the principles of dramatic science,&#xD;
which we might other wise had an opportunity of&#xD;
recording.&#xD;

tired home and to bed.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
SYMPTOMATIC CASE OF A DISTEMPER TO WHICH IN-&#xD;
EXPERIENCED AFFECTION IS VERY LIABLE.&#xD;
WHEN he was not engaged in the evening, Mr.&#xD;
Winkfield was frequently accustomed to resort to&#xD;
the Hetherington parlor, there to cultivate the&#xD;
society of the youthful couple, and sometimes&#xD;
during the day he would accept the young mar-&#xD;
quis's invitation to walk with him in the purlieus.&#xD;
On these latter occasions, the wife generally bade&#xD;
her husband adieu, as if he were departing for a&#xD;
long voyage, and the young lord appeared to be&#xD;
laboring under the same impression, for no sooner&#xD;
did he leave her sight, than he would begin to&#xD;
write short notes of love and encouragement to&#xD;
her upon his hat in the street, -nd dispatch the&#xD;
same to her by the swiftest running messenger or&#xD;
idler near by. Tbh benevolent Moses was becqm-&#xD;
ing more ar9 more interested in them, and took&#xD;
great F,1ns in delicately offering to their inexperi-&#xD;
.ice all the applicable rules of life which he&#xD;
could remember or deduce. His enthusiasm rose&#xD;
to a great height, and he thought he. saw clearly&#xD;
a gseat change in them, which he proudly attri-&#xD;
buted to their contact with him and his philoso-&#xD;
phy. If there may have lately appeared a slight&#xD;
peculiarity in the conduct of both toward him, it&#xD;
was either imputed to his own fancy or to the&#xD;
slight excess of the interest which they woulc&#xD;
naturally endeavor to show in him. He was a&#xD;
little mystified on several occasions, by observing&#xD;
after some remark he had made, in particular of&#xD;
a complimentary nature, that they would both&#xD;
obtusely stare at him for a while, then look a&#xD;
each other with a slight appearance of consterna&#xD;
tion, and finally smile in a forced manner to ac&#xD;
knowledge the same. He also once or twice dis&#xD;
covered the young count, supported by. the coun&#xD;
tess, listening at his keyhole; and he further no&#xD;
ticed that while the count less frequently propose&#xD;
the customary walk with him, they now invari&#xD;
ably followed him to the front-door when he wen&#xD;
out, subsequently appearing at the front-windov&#xD;
to follow him with their gaze until he had disap&#xD;
peared from the street.I&#xD;
"A great interest. They are taking a grea&#xD;
interest-in me," thought Moses in generous pride&#xD;
"1And they manifest it in this original way, th&#xD;
droll creatures !" .&#xD;
On one occasion, having learned from him tha&#xD;
he intended to leave the city for a short period&#xD;
and after a circunlocutory extraction from him o&#xD;
the proposed duration of'his absence, the youth&#xD;
ful count simultaneously paid a flying visit to hi;&#xD;
aunt in Waterbury, and returned in the evenin&#xD;
train.&#xD;
The conversation which ensued upon his am&#xD;
rival, and the joyful embrace of his spouse, ma&#xD;
be interesting to the reader, and perhaps of am&#xD;
sistance in elucidating the mystery which wasb&#xD;
ginning to envelop our hero in his relations wit&#xD;
his host and hostess.&#xD;
&#xD;
I" He has already got back and been here,"&#xD;
said the countess.&#xD;
"Say any thing?" asked the young husband&#xD;
briefly but expressively, after they had sat still&#xD;
for some moments.&#xD;
COUNTEsS.-" Yes."&#xD;
COuNT.-" Allude to your nose again ?"&#xD;
COUNTESS. -"es."&#xD;
" It must be so!" continued the count. " What&#xD;
do you suppose led him to select us ?"&#xD;
" It was the advertisement."&#xD;
"Oh! no. It could not have been that. Look&#xD;
at him. He has no business, he says. He wishes&#xD;
to aid us with his friendship and advice. Yes, it&#xD;
is deliberate.  He conducts himself properly&#xD;
now, in order that he may be the more unsus-&#xD;
pected.  Luckily, I have been awakened in-&#xD;
time."&#xD;
Painful silence for a few moments.&#xD;
" Yes, if ever villain was written in a human&#xD;
countenance in legible characters, it is surely iun&#xD;
his. But why need we anticipate fresh evils ." re-&#xD;
sumed the unhappy husband, making an effort&#xD;
to be cheerful. "Though we be bewildered by&#xD;
the extent of our present ones, do we not love&#xD;
each other, dear?  And shall not that sustain us&#xD;
against all the rude assaults of the world, of&#xD;
peniwry, and with the ad of the strong arm of&#xD;
Bridget, of such stoopers to deception, and un-&#xD;
principled monsters searching for their prey as&#xD;
this one?'&#xD;
" My dearest duck, never shall I be found suf-&#xD;
ficiently liberal in my most unguarded moment to&#xD;
enable him ever to mention the subject of a&#xD;
sympathetic confidence to me, And should he&#xD;
do so, you know, I can easily call the cook! "&#xD;
" Oh! yes, and let the miscreant, as he would&#xD;
thus prove himself to be, feel himself then if he&#xD;
I dared a match for Bridget. We can not let her&#xD;
know about this matter now. But she must be&#xD;
prepared as she was to day for such an emergen-&#xD;
cy. Let her keep the kettle constantly boiling&#xD;
i during his presence in the house, or let her have&#xD;
the pepper-canister convenient b the door at&#xD;
- all times."&#xD;
- " What a mysterious fate envelops us, in this&#xD;
- our early life of wedded existence, my Rainsford!&#xD;
- Is it not strange that the evil which menaces us&#xD;
should have penetrated even to our hearthstone,&#xD;
d ere we were awakened from unconsciousness&#xD;
.. and laid its meshes, like a malignant fowl, on our&#xD;

e ," Why didn't he fall in love with some single&#xD;
lady?  There are so many who would run away&#xD;

" My dear, he could not help it, the scoundrel&#xD;
f lie could not resist your fatal beauty, the miser-&#xD;
- able rascal ! You are too, too beautiful."&#xD;
s   The conversation here ended, for the youmg&#xD;

&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
siasm, says, "he was proud of his seed." His&#xD;
posterity imitate him closely; so are they. Mr.&#xD;
Toplady knew all this, but it was not the head of&#xD;
cabbage but the sweet cabbage-rose, which now&#xD;
represented that illustrious family at Mr. Wag-&#xD;
bull's, if the vegetable simile may be pardoned;&#xD;
and to continue the metaphor, we may say he de-&#xD;
voted himself to besprinkling it with a rather&#xD;
large-sized watering-pot of flattery. Owing partly&#xD;
to his constitutional timidity and partly to the&#xD;
constitutional hauteur of the young lady, we have&#xD;
to chronicle that his efforts, both to dine and&#xD;
to converse, were, perhaps, but partially success-&#xD;
ful. He was afraid to be brilliant, lest he should&#xD;
be cynical; and he was afraid to be good-na-&#xD;
tured, lest he should be commonplace.    He&#xD;
therefore vibrated, during the dinner, between&#xD;
the two, and had the appearance of being neither.&#xD;
Nevertheless, when he rejoined the ladies in the&#xD;
drawing-room, his nature, inspirited by the re-&#xD;
freshment of the repast, completely asserted it-&#xD;
self; for he then had enough wit in his memory,&#xD;
and imagination in his reason, to make himself&#xD;
an object of decided distinction. On the same&#xD;
principle that champagne is improved by ice, Miss&#xD;
De Pompenkop's natural coldness had-the pleas-&#xD;
ant effect of making his sparkling efforts to&#xD;
entertain her extremely refreshing to those who&#xD;
observed them.&#xD;
During the course of the evening, Miss Wag-&#xD;
bull again entertained Moses; and, in the enun-&#xD;
ciation of some views upon the duties of her own&#xD;
sex, she manifested such unaffected modesty, yet&#xD;
such a nobleness of thinking, that it deeplyI&#xD;
moved him. There was no truer eloquence thanI&#xD;
the simplicity of her manner and language, and&#xD;
the truths which she uttered seemed adorned'&#xD;
and improved by a disposition in which innocence&#xD;
and reason were united. She seemed to think&#xD;
that, as the grand object of education was moral&#xD;
excellence, domestic life was the best fitted to&#xD;
cherish that of woman. Her self-conceit might&#xD;
be corrected, her taste purified, her understand-&#xD;
ing raised by moderate contact with the world;&#xD;
but she seemed fitted by nature to best adorn the&#xD;
interior of a private life; for her interests were&#xD;
there.&#xD;
"They do not seem to understand woman's&#xD;
true duties," said- she, "who seek to do away, on&#xD;
the ground of her dependence upon man, with&#xD;
distinctions which increase the mutual benefits,&#xD;
and enhance the satisfactions of life. In that&#xD;
dependence lies, not only our security, but our&#xD;
happiness." n         y o     s     b   Ou&#xD;
There is nq imputation of inferiority in her&#xD;
dependence upon man," interrupted Moses warm-&#xD;
ly. "Each sex.has its proper excellencies, which&#xD;
are derived from a mutual dependence."&#xD;
"Yes, woman has her influence upon man,"&#xD;
continued Bessie, blushing; "but the amiability&#xD;
which captivates his spirit, the elegance which soft-&#xD;
ens his manners in society, is derived from the&#xD;
moral excellence, which the consciousness of her&#xD;
real duties gives her. She can not long use her&#xD;
boasted power over him, to no higher purpose&#xD;
than the gratification of her vanity, her desire for&#xD;
notoriety, or the indulgence of pleasure, without&#xD;
producing disgust in him and danger for herself.&#xD;
It seems to me, therefore, that those of our sex&#xD;
who have an ambition to shine in society, as it is&#xD;
called, commit a fundamental error. The virtues&#xD;
of woman have nothing dazzling; it is only her&#xD;
&#xD;
vices that can be conspicuous, and she may thus&#xD;
become, not an object of contempt or hate, but&#xD;
of compassion; for even one imprudence upon&#xD;
her part may tarnish a thousand excellent quali-&#xD;
ties. Yet it should not be accounted a hardship,&#xD;
but a privilege, that her character is so delicate&#xD;
as to be sullied by the slightest breath of calumny,&#xD;
and that the stain is indelible; for by this she is&#xD;
led to shrink from all those irregularities, those&#xD;
notorieties, which impair her excellence in the&#xD;
performance of her duties."&#xD;
" And there is another reproach which may be&#xD;
cast upon us," continued she earnestly, "and&#xD;
which in turn might ask its reformation from&#xD;
you, and that is, the habit of constant falsehood&#xD;
of living to conceal ourselves. As we are in-&#xD;
structed from infancy to please you, we have no&#xD;
other care but to conceal that which will be dis-&#xD;
pleasing to you. The yoke of constant dissimu-&#xD;
lation has been imposed on woman by her posi-&#xD;
tion; but to show herself as ehe is, to frankly&#xD;
confess her faults, is what a true woman longs for.&#xD;
When you convince us that you love truth, we&#xD;
will tell it to you always-always !"&#xD;
" Were all women as you, Miss Wagbull,"&#xD;
said Moses, deeply approving her candor, "they&#xD;
would lose nothing by doing so."&#xD;
" Woman's ambition is to be loved," resumed&#xD;
she. 1"If you wilt say she becomes lovely by her&#xD;
sincerity, the sex would strive unaffectedly in this;&#xD;
but you worship the charms of her person, the&#xD;
illusion of, her manners, and each tries who shall&#xD;
charm and deceive you the most. As for our&#xD;
wars, our jealousies, our little animosities and&#xD;
bickerings, their consequences are perhaps not&#xD;
more serious than yours," concluded she, smiling;&#xD;
"and when you say that something more solid&#xD;
shall take the place of our frivolous tastes and&#xD;
humors, the latter will also disappear."&#xD;
" Yes, and I now see that there are women&#xD;
who can nobly rise from under the pressure of a&#xD;
disadvantageous system of education and of so-&#xD;
ciety, and exhibit the most decided marks of a&#xD;
vigorous understanding and correct judgment,"&#xD;
said Moses in sincere admiration.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
MOSES nEcEIVES AN ODD NOTE.&#xD;
UPON his invitation to dinner at Mr. Wagbull's,&#xD;
Moses had procured a very beautiful japonica,&#xD;
which he intended as a peace-offering to the&#xD;
grandmother thereat. He was met at the door&#xD;
of his lodgings by Mrs. Hetherington, who&#xD;
feigned great admiration of it. Moses very gal-&#xD;
lantly forewent the intended onslaught on the&#xD;
old lady's animosity, and presented his young&#xD;
hostess with the flower. Her husband appeared&#xD;
from his hiding-place on the kitchen stairs, as&#xD;
soon as the innocent Moses repaired to his room.&#xD;
They said nothing at the moment, and soon&#xD;
sought their bower.&#xD;
"Hush! There he goes out I" said the count&#xD;
at last, when Moses, having donned his dress-&#xD;
coat, left for Mr. Wagbull's residence, .&#xD;
" He is going .to a party to-night. What a&#xD;
beautiful flower this is!" said the counters,&#xD;
Yes," replied the count briefly.&#xD;
"le is very kind, and certainly has taste,"&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7256-00000029"/>&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD.                         57&#xD;
&#xD;
56                       MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
continued the countess, with woman-like weak-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
" H'm! Well, perhaps he has," replied the&#xD;
husband somewhat gruffly.&#xD;
" And, what a pity it is he should undertake&#xD;
to be so bad. He was so pleasant to me, when&#xD;
he gave it me, and-"&#xD;
" Ma-am!" cried the count sternly; "Mary&#xD;
Matilda Watson !"&#xD;
" What is the matter, Rainsford ?"&#xD;
"You think to deceive me, ma'am?     You&#xD;
would deceive your legally constituted husband ?"&#xD;
"Why, dear, what do you mean?"&#xD;
"But I'll thwart you, madam; I'll thwart&#xD;
you," exclaimed the husband, jumping about in&#xD;
an alarming manner. "I'll thwart you and the&#xD;
partner of your schemes! I'll call the police!&#xD;
I'll have the assistance of the authorities, of&#xD;
aunt, the sheriff, with military aid, if neces.&#xD;
scary !"&#xD;
Here the inhappy'young man flew about in a&#xD;
frenzy, which a too vivid imagination had pro-&#xD;
duced, slapped things indiscriminately, threw the&#xD;
japonica upon the floor, jumped upon it vigor-&#xD;
ously, and dared his wife to attempt to stop him&#xD;
in his frantic career.&#xD;
" You have a plan !" roared he to his aston-&#xD;
ished, frightened little lady.&#xD;
"A plan! I-a-what-what do you mean ?"&#xD;
" You have a planu  a preconcerted, pro-con-&#xD;
cocted plan !"&#xD;
"t ' haven't," said the eqnfused Mrs. Hether-&#xD;
ington vehemently.&#xD;
"You-have !" said the count, in furious reek-&#xD;
lessness.  " You. intend to run away with this&#xD;
Winkfield to-morrow morning at half-past six.&#xD;
I see it all!"1&#xD;
"Heavensy! I don't ! What ! you accuse your&#xD;
own wife of-"&#xD;
" You do !" reiterated the count. "Aha! I&#xD;
see confession in your eye !"&#xD;
" You don't. You are mad-you, my hus-&#xD;
band, to-"' .&#xD;
" Do you mean to say," asked the count,&#xD;
"that you have not made an arrangement with&#xD;
this miserable ravening rooster and unprincipled&#xD;
wretch, to-to desert me P"&#xD;
No!" exclaimed the wife hysterically.&#xD;
"Then you 4on't love him, Mary Watson, and&#xD;
admire his devilish flowers ?'&#xD;
" 0 Rainsford !"&#xD;
" And vou don't think him handsome, and like&#xD;
his legs?"'&#xD;
" No. He is a nasty, good-for-nothing, ugly&#xD;
man!" cried the wife energetically, amid her&#xD;
tears; " and I hate him!"-&#xD;
" 0 my darling wife !" exclaimed the repent-&#xD;
ant lord in sudden remorse. "Have I been&#xD;
rash?  Have I done you a wrong ?"&#xD;
"My Rainsford ! my own Rainsford !"&#xD;
" Now hushed be every fear. Where, oh!&#xD;
where is my own wife, that I may once more hold&#xD;
her to my bosom!",&#xD;
The cloud had passed. After some sacred mo-&#xD;
ments, they were sufficiently restored to be able&#xD;
to concert together further defense against the&#xD;
common enemy.&#xD;
" We must continue to dissemble," said the&#xD;
count- " We must treat the heartless spoilern&#xD;
with the smile on our lips, yet with vengeanc&#xD;
ready in our hearts. When tihe fell ruffian, witi&#xD;
impious, hands would snatch you hence, th~&#xD;
&#xD;
atrocious villain shall fall beneath my arms-and&#xD;
legs-or if not mine alone, Bridget's !'"&#xD;
" But let us warn him. Let us write a letter&#xD;
and warn him. It may have the effect of stop-&#xD;
ping him."&#xD;
"A letter, eh ?"&#xD;
"A letter, and sign it as if it came from some&#xD;
one who saw his wicked plans-anonymously P"&#xD;
" You are right, Mollid. The very thing, if&#xD;
we make it strong. We will make the wretch&#xD;
tremble in his shoes, even now.",&#xD;
That evening, returning from the dinner-party,&#xD;
Moses found on his dressing case the following&#xD;
epistle addressed to him, and headed:&#xD;
ATROcIoUs MEMBER OF SOCIETY!&#xD;
" Think you that the glance of your eye, like&#xD;
that of the basilisk, shall transfix your victim ?&#xD;
Let the evil spirit, assuming a human form&#xD;
wreathed with sunny smiles, beware! E'en now,&#xD;
despite superstitious dread, may he be de-&#xD;
nounced and hurled from his station. If he may&#xD;
be tortured by the unceasing dread of detection,&#xD;
shall he not soon feel the stings of a conscience&#xD;
that knows no rest ? Stamped in characters of&#xD;
fire, the warning comes! Deception, treachery,&#xD;
machinations, schemer, beware ! The eyes of&#xD;
society are upon you !"&#xD;
(Signed)&#xD;
" JuNius AND MANY OTHER CITIZENS.&#xD;
" N. B.-It is useless for you to attempt to dis-&#xD;
cover the boy who brings this. He has been&#xD;
properly rewarded and has willingly returned to&#xD;
a secure obscurity-we may say-in another na-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
This was the most extraordinary and unintelli-&#xD;
gible piece of correspondence that Mr. Wink-&#xD;
field had ever received. And the inquiries which&#xD;
he made respecting its delivery, of Mr. and Mrs.&#xD;
Hetherington, only made it the more so.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVI,&#xD;
MOSES AND MR. TOPLADY ATTEND A PICNIC AND&#xD;
FESTIVAL'Or THE ASBURY SUNDAY-SCHlOOL.&#xD;
IT was a fine May morning, and Moses was&#xD;
seated with his uncle, in the latter's office.&#xD;
" It is a splendid day, Moses; I wish I were in&#xD;
the country, this morning. I feel a longing to&#xD;
be in the country," reiterated Mr. Toplady.&#xD;
"So do I, uncle," replied Moses, snuffing the&#xD;
- green fields and May flowers in imagination.&#xD;
, Here a very ragged urchin entered the room.&#xD;
"Have your boots shined, sir ?"&#xD;
" No."&#xD;
"Would you like to buy couple-er tickets to a&#xD;
Sunday-school festivial?" continued the boy de-&#xD;
murely.&#xD;
" To a what?"&#xD;
"Sunday-school picnic, sir."'&#xD;
-   "Eh? Where did you get them, boy?" asked&#xD;
Mr. Toplady, "from the teachers ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"Eh, you are sure you haven't stolen them&#xD;
from some place, or some little boy in the street 2"9&#xD;
asked Mr. Toplady again, auspicious of the&#xD;
youth's shabby appearance.&#xD;
" Oh ! no, sir," replied the latter, and there.-&#xD;
eupon he commenced the well-known juvenile re-&#xD;
&#xD;
frain of "-Oh! the Sunday-school, the Sunday-&#xD;
school.!" to prove the legitimacy of his connec-&#xD;
tion with the matter.&#xD;
"Never mind, that will do, that will do," hasti-&#xD;
ly said Mr. Toplady, wincing. "Quite a coinci-&#xD;
dence, Moses.  It is a picnic and festival of the&#xD;
Asbury Sunday-school, Rev. Mr. Knox's Metho-&#xD;
dist Episcopal, and is for this very day, ten&#xD;
o clock," continued he, reading one of the tick-&#xD;
ets. "It is not aristocratic, but respectable,&#xD;
Moses; -if you were to go, you would have -an&#xD;
opportunity Qf seeing a new set of honest peo-&#xD;
ple from the other side of town."&#xD;
Ah ! I should like that," replied Moses.&#xD;
It seems, it is to be held in a grove, on the&#xD;
west bank of the Hudson," proceeded Mr. Top-&#xD;
lady, examining the tickets again.  "Rather in-&#xD;
definite. However, it will be a pleasant little ex-&#xD;
cursion. What say you, Moses, do you wish to&#xD;
go? The sail upon the river will be just the&#xD;
thing for us, and we can simply look on, you&#xD;
know, not actively participate."&#xD;
"Well, we will, then," said Moses.&#xD;
"Here,. boy, we'll take them."&#xD;
The boy received the money and disappeared.&#xD;
As they had no time to lose, they started at once&#xD;
for the steamboat. Upon reaching the latter,&#xD;
they observed upon its decks many male adults,&#xD;
rather rough in exterior, and, without doubt, the&#xD;
fathers and brothers of the scholars.&#xD;
" Where are the children and ladies ?" in-&#xD;
quired Moses of his uncle.&#xD;
"The boat is small, and somewhat crowded.&#xD;
I suppose they have assembled in the ladies'&#xD;
cabin. The Sunday-school is not yet on board,&#xD;
sir ?" asked Mr. Toplady of a gentleman, smok-&#xD;
ing a segar near him.*&#xD;
" No," replied the latter, taking a curious sur-&#xD;
vey of. Moses and his uncle. "They are not&#xD;
going in this boat. They are -on the ground,&#xD;
and went early this mornin', to have no fail !"&#xD;
"But this is the boat for the picnic and festi-&#xD;
val of the Asbury Church ?" asked Mr. Top-&#xD;
lady.&#xD;
"Eh? Hullo, I say, Sam," exclaimed    the&#xD;
stranger, pulling around a friend near by, "these&#xD;
here gents wants to know if this here boat is for&#xD;
picnic and festival. ,What do you think of it?"&#xD;
"Let 'em find out !' replied the other gruffly,&#xD;
afeer a short survey of our friends. "If they&#xD;
come here to make a muss, let 'em find out. I&#xD;
know a peeler, Jim, when he's got store-clothes&#xD;
on and when he han't."&#xD;
" But, my friends," continued Mr. Toplady,&#xD;
"we ask merely for information."&#xD;
"I bought my ticket for the Asbury Sunday-&#xD;
school picnic and festival, and this here was de-&#xD;
signated the boat to me, by the parties," replied&#xD;
the other. "I don't know nothin' more about it,&#xD;
I don't say no more; you'd better go ashore if&#xD;
you don't think this here is the boat for a picnic&#xD;
and festival."&#xD;
" You won't make nothing' by staying, " con-&#xD;
tinued the first stranger superciliously.&#xD;
But we have tickets, and thought we would&#xD;
like to see the picnic," courteously continued&#xD;
Toplady, in propitiation.&#xD;
" You an't peelers in mufety ?" asked the sec-&#xD;
ond stranger.&#xD;
" What ?" asked Mr. Toplady.&#xD;
"I say, you an't peelers in mufety ?" reiterat-&#xD;
ed the stranger, raising his voice.,,&#xD;
&#xD;
" Excuse me, my friend," continued Mr. Top-&#xD;
lady, "but you observed-"&#xD;
" Look here, plugs, you can't raise no muss on&#xD;
to me, leastwise until this here boat is off. You&#xD;
can't raise no muss on to me, nor Bill, nor no one&#xD;
else here," repeated tle stranger strongly, and&#xD;
moving off with te other.&#xD;
"I think we had better go ashore, uncle ; I&#xD;
think we had better give it up," said Moses.&#xD;
"Don't you ?"&#xD;
" Yes, perhaps we had. GraciousI there is&#xD;
the boat moving. We can't, Moses."&#xD;
"What did he mean by peelers ?" now asked&#xD;
Moses dubiously.&#xD;
"I don't know. I am very sorry there are&#xD;
disagreeable characters on board ;, I didn't ex-&#xD;
pect them. However, there are surly people&#xD;
everywhere," replied Mr. Toplady.&#xD;
" If we had been earlier, perhaps, we might&#xD;
have gone with the Sunday-school."&#xD;
"That is what I supposed would be the ar-&#xD;
rangement Moses, of course."&#xD;
The boal was now in the stream. It was much&#xD;
crowded, and Moses and his uncle concluded to&#xD;
move into a quiet corner near the wheel, from&#xD;
the deck upon which they were.&#xD;
"They will get in order directly, and then the&#xD;
ladies will come up from the cabin below, and&#xD;
there will be, no doubt, a dance or two in the&#xD;
saloon."&#xD;
"Yes, and we are in a capital place to look at&#xD;
the scenery in the mean time. On the whole, it&#xD;
is fortunate we did not stay back," said Moses.&#xD;
Most of the people appeared to have assem-&#xD;
bled forward.&#xD;
"dWhat a delightful day I" exclaimed Mr. Top-&#xD;
lady, invigorated by the breeze , nnd forgetting&#xD;
the late disagreeable conversation. "These little&#xD;
excursions are very beneficial affairs to the city.&#xD;
They give the yeomanry and working classes an&#xD;
opportunity to restore their health and to relieve&#xD;
their spirits from the jaded monotony of daily&#xD;
labor. They are truly benevolent occasions, and&#xD;
it is not unbecoming in a gentleman now and&#xD;
then to patronize them."&#xD;
The boat rapidly passed from the region of the&#xD;
ferry-boats, and soon left the city in the rear,&#xD;
while the green heights of Weehawken and the&#xD;
Palisades began to bound the landscape on one&#xD;
side, and those of Fort Washington on the other.&#xD;
At this point, a united and vigorous cheer from&#xD;
the front part of the boat greeted our friends'&#xD;
cars. Sonic youthful -gentlemen within their&#xD;
sight on the after-deck, uttered a sympathetic cry&#xD;
thereat, and one ejaculated: "It is a go this&#xD;
time. No stopping this time, by -!"&#xD;
Hereupon another cheer arose again from be-&#xD;
low, which immediately elicited another yell front&#xD;
the parties nearer by, and two or three of the&#xD;
latter appeared to have been suddenly afflicted&#xD;
with a severe attack of terpsichorean frenzy.&#xD;
While Moses and his uncle from their recess&#xD;
were confusedly observing this performance, an&#xD;
indescribable noise and disorder arose, which&#xD;
seemed to be in all parts of the b6at. Invitations&#xD;
to drink, boisterous laughter, and extremely for-&#xD;
cible language, as if on the part of fifty people&#xD;
at once, assailed the hearing of our friends.&#xD;
"Gracious ! There certainly can be no0 ladies&#xD;
upon this boat ; for the honor of humanity and&#xD;
decency, I hope not 1" exclaimed Moses indig-&#xD;
nantly. " What do they mean ? Is this a&#xD;

MR. WINKFIELD.-     .9&#xD;
&#xD;
not improper personages, neither peelers nor in&#xD;
formers, but both literary gentlemen, connoisseurs&#xD;
in the turf and ring, and amateur reporters, one&#xD;
for the liberal religious press, and the other&#xD;
present on behalf of the ladies' organ of the&#xD;
Bloomer movement. He induced them to accept&#xD;
the disclaimers of our friends at any offense inten-&#xD;
tionally offered, and by the masterly stroke of in-&#xD;
viting the entire crowd to refresh itself at the bar,&#xD;
actually placed our friends upon an enviable foot-&#xD;
ig for future influence and popularity in the&#xD;
New-York sporting world.&#xD;
. In company with Mr. Barnard, their jovial&#xD;
rescuer, they now felt at ease enough to rove&#xD;
about the boat and mingle in the festivities.&#xD;
From the fact that lie had made a successful and&#xD;
honorable stand in his late encounter, not only&#xD;
having warded off his antagonist's blows, but&#xD;
actually struck out twice himself, and seized with&#xD;
the propensity for imitation, Mr. Toplady fre-&#xD;
quently doubled up his fists, and perhaps would&#xD;
have joined inthe little pugilistic entertainments&#xD;
offered intermittently thereafter, if he had not&#xD;
been restrained by Mr. Barnard's advice, and&#xD;
Moses's request. He therefore confined himself&#xD;
to the little'ingenuities of feigning to express his&#xD;
admiration, or high sense of the ludicrous, at&#xD;
some horrible story of physical mutilation and&#xD;
mangling, related with great gusto by adjacent&#xD;
parties, or of loudly expressing his impatience at&#xD;
the delay of the boat in reaching her destination,&#xD;
The temporary demoralization of our hero had&#xD;
not reached this lively stage, owing to a slight&#xD;
indisposition he was suffering from the effects of&#xD;
a segar, which he had deemed it judicious t-o&#xD;
smoke under the circumstances. le still made&#xD;
quite a successful attempt at self-degradation, by&#xD;
talking horse and dog with the numerous sport-&#xD;
ing men, aldermen, and ex-prize-fighters, to&#xD;
whom lie was subsequently introduced, and by&#xD;
sagaciously making use of what knowledge he&#xD;
had picked up on the boat, in discussing with&#xD;
them the noble art, and the approaching contest.&#xD;
Guided by his genius he authoritatively sustained&#xD;
or denied, as the occasion demanded, the little&#xD;
scientific points therein, of which he had not the,&#xD;
slightest idea; and when two of the parties dif-&#xD;
fered, he at once concluded to side with the&#xD;
largest and most muscular, another instance of'&#xD;
his innate genius, and the judicious employment.&#xD;
under trying circumstances, of his knowledge of&#xD;
human nature.&#xD;
Mr. Barnard received with a highly pleased&#xD;
air these  demonstrations  of his  new-made&#xD;
friends, whose predilections he increased by&#xD;
his lively manners, hei witty appreciation of the&#xD;
Inferior animals present, and by succeeding acts&#xD;
of friendship, wherein lie introduced himself as a&#xD;
member of a well-known and respectable family&#xD;
of the city, and gave them much beneficialjinfor-&#xD;
mation upon surrounding and other' social affairs.&#xD;
The boat was steered for a rickety wharf in a&#xD;
secluded bay of the river.  The crowd disem-&#xD;
barked, including Moies and Mr. Toplady, who&#xD;
acceded to Mr. Barnard's solicitations, and to his&#xD;
suggestion that it would be judicious for them&#xD;
to sustain their assumed character as reporters.&#xD;
The contest at once took place between Bandy&#xD;
the Kid, and the Rev. M. Thomas Slotmons, so&#xD;
called, the one from his frisky agility, and the&#xD;
other from his long countenance, and general1&#xD;
clerical appearance. For the particulars thereof,&#xD;
&#xD;
we will refer our readers to that celebrated au-&#xD;
thority in such matters, the New-York Clipper,&#xD;
merely mentioning a few of the striking points&#xD;
'*ourselves.&#xD;
At twelve M., the men shied their nob cover-&#xD;
ers into the ring, and shook their bunches of&#xD;
- fives at the scratch. The betting was five to&#xD;
- four on Slommons, as the Kid showed too beefy,&#xD;
being fourteen stone, three pounds, and four&#xD;
. ounces, or about two ounces over his usual fight-&#xD;
log weight.&#xD;
1st Round. Slommons made the opening shot&#xD;
on the chopper, followed by a straight deliv-&#xD;
ery on the left peeper, the Kid being short in&#xD;
his returns, though he planted a rib-bender and&#xD;
got away. This brought on some rattling ex-&#xD;
changes to a close, when they fibbed away at the&#xD;
ribs, and in the wrestle for the fall Slommons&#xD;
was undermost.&#xD;
2d Round. Both shots went over the shoulder&#xD;
and stopped upon the stmellers of the two&#xD;
seconds, who  had approached too near from&#xD;
professional anxiety, which elicited cries of&#xD;
"foul" from both.&#xD;
5th Round. In this round some very rapid&#xD;
passages ensued, the dial being the target, when&#xD;
both pugs got to in-fighting, and Slommons&#xD;
threw his man heavily.&#xD;
6th Round. First ruby for the Kid; the&#xD;
clergyman having left his gate open, the kid'came&#xD;
in and politely knocked on his parlor door to&#xD;
inquire for his health.&#xD;
10th Round. Both lively, fighting fast at&#xD;
the ribs, shiftily. The Kid invested slightly on&#xD;
the bread-basket; Slotmmons countering on the&#xD;
left, and placing the Kid's tob in chateery&#xD;
leisurely delivered several hundred taps tiereo,&#xD;
raising a bump. Both lively, however, and&#xD;
rallying to the ropes get down side by side con-&#xD;
versing on political matters, and Mrs. Lanigan's&#xD;
fashionable blow-out. The succeeding rounds up&#xD;
to the fortieth well-contested, though both dod-&#xD;
ders were frequently short in their deliveries and&#xD;
compelled to spar for bellows-ease,&#xD;
40. The Kid's nose spattered over his face? by&#xD;
a most beautiful, scientific, and powerful straight&#xD;
from the clergyman's right. This daring use of&#xD;
the right showed his genius, and aroused a&#xD;
thumping clap from all the sharps present.&#xD;
56. Bandy closed his left eye permanently.&#xD;
Some good half-arm blows at the ropes by Slom-&#xD;
mons, but Kid finally sent in one of his catty-&#xD;
pults, which resulted iti a double somersault by&#xD;
the clergyman over the ropes. Cries of " foul"&#xD;
at its stoppage by his buffer, who caught hinm by&#xD;
left walker, but declared all moral by referees,&#xD;
as being out of ring.&#xD;
63. Both down and forgetful-like.&#xD;
64. Both men pounded on the head with um-&#xD;
pire's slung-shot, and a glass of turpentine ad-&#xD;
ministered to each, to bring them to time.&#xD;
64-70. All in favor of Slommons, the Kid&#xD;
not having been well since sixty-third round.&#xD;
(NOTE. There is one thing which we here take&#xD;
occasion to protest against, both as gentlemen&#xD;
and lovers of the manly art. We trust that&#xD;
every true, every honest upholder of that noble&#xD;
science will sustain us in 'discountenancing a&#xD;
practice which we consider is fast beconmitn a&#xD;

We allude to the innovation of outsiders talking&#xD;
with the seconds of the men and offering them&#xD;

of responsibility, and the pea-nuts distract their&#xD;
attention from their duties. The whole thing&#xD;
strikes at the very vitality of the art, and should&#xD;
hereafter be discouraged by every one.)&#xD;
70th round. Kid feinted with his left, got&#xD;
down on knee, caught clergyman by rising blow&#xD;
under left ear, and seizing him by belt, sat down&#xD;
on ground and went through a remarkable pro-&#xD;
cess with him. It was asserted by many of those&#xD;
who could see through whirl of strikers and&#xD;
walkers, to have been that of turning him inside&#xD;
out and scraping him. Referees distracted and&#xD;
umpire agitated, but as clergyman turned up in&#xD;
natural condition, decision of " foul" by umpire&#xD;
avoided.&#xD;
71. Increase of mysterious, energy of Kid.&#xD;
Again caught Slommons by walkers, and thrash-&#xD;
ed him for several moments on the ground. Not&#xD;
foul, as blows received on nob and above the&#xD;
belt. No particular effect on clergyman, not be-&#xD;
ing meaty, except slight ringing in his sound-&#xD;
boxes, sand-swallowing, and dirty face.  Rose&#xD;
and smiled.&#xD;
71-108. All in favor of clergyman, who ap-&#xD;
peared to have been refreshed by rounds seven-&#xD;
ty and seventy-one. The Kid wonderfully cranky&#xD;
and powerful, but wild and continued grog-fight-&#xD;
ing of the air.&#xD;
109th and last round. In this round the Kid&#xD;
violated the rules by attempting to strike below&#xD;
belt. He then followed it up decisively, by ad-&#xD;
ministering a severe kick upon one of the aston-&#xD;
ished clergyman's shins, another in his abdomen,&#xD;
a third upon the other shin, and incidentally&#xD;
made a reckless attempt to take advantage of&#xD;
his improper proceedings, by biting off one of his&#xD;
antagonist's ears.&#xD;
At the shout of "foul !" which marked this&#xD;
illegitimate and unexpected conduct as the final&#xD;
triumph of Slommons, the disgusted bottle-holder&#xD;
of the Kid was meditating the disagreeable neces-&#xD;
sity of throwing up the sponge, when he was vio-&#xD;
lently thrown up himself by his principal. . The&#xD;
latter had been fairly pounded into insanity. He&#xD;
dashed right and bgft through the crowd and start-&#xD;
ed in the obliquity of derangement for the.river,&#xD;
but was secured ere he reached it. The two re-&#xD;
porters thought it professionally unnecessary to&#xD;
return again from the steamboat to which they had&#xD;
fled, but the crowd reissenbled on the spot, and&#xD;
the fight was given to the Rev. Mr. Slommons.&#xD;
The gentlemen who had risked their money upon&#xD;
the skill and endurance of the unfortunate Kid,&#xD;
immediately commenced to relieve their feelings&#xD;
of loss by indiscriminately assaulting the backers&#xD;
of the victor. To our friends' utter amazement&#xD;
and fear, the whole Sunday-school fought all the&#xD;
way back to the boat, and continued the conflict&#xD;
upon its decks after it left the spot. 'Such was&#xD;
the disorder, that Moses, Mr. Toplady, and Mr.&#xD;
Barnard very rationally secreted themselves in a&#xD;
coal-hole, afd the captain of the boat, overcome&#xD;
with fears for the safety of himself and his yes&#xD;
sed, run it ashore upon the other side of the(&#xD;
river. Here the scholars finally scattered in al&#xD;
directions, the losers to indemnify themselves by&#xD;
&#xD;
the gentle process of robbing sequestered houses&#xD;
and wayfarers, afid the winners generally assist-&#xD;
ing them, in preference to being longer belabored&#xD;
over the head, and at the same time indulging&#xD;
their enthusiasm at the result of the day, in the&#xD;
playful collateral proceedings of breaking open&#xD;
wine-cellars and bars, smashing furniture and&#xD;
windows, and insulting protestants thereto ere&#xD;
they proceeded to lie down for the night, or to&#xD;
seek the different stations on the route to betake&#xD;
themselves to town.&#xD;
Alarmed at the abrupt landing of the steamer,&#xD;
Moses and Mr. Toplady had emerged with and&#xD;
become separated from  their friend, Mr. Bar-&#xD;
nard. The latter hastened forward to generous-&#xD;
'ly assist the captain in his difficulties, but the&#xD;
former were forcibly shoved ashore in the midst&#xD;
of a crowd of infuriated combatants, of whose&#xD;
blows they seemed to have become the common&#xD;
centre. Their deliverance from this mailstrom&#xD;
of passion could only have been miraculous, and&#xD;
even thus was accomplished at the expense of&#xD;
many terrible contusions of the person and lace-&#xD;
rations  of habiliments.  They  bewilderedly&#xD;
sought the railway track, and ran for over three&#xD;
miles in the twilight to the nearest settlement,&#xD;
their speed being materially increased by the&#xD;
fearful knowledge that they were chased by five&#xD;
of their fellow-excursionists, maddened with drink&#xD;
and disappointment, and armed with a select ar-&#xD;
mory of deadly weapons.&#xD;
On reaching the Evercroft House by the evening&#xD;
train, Mr. Toplady gave a feeble smile at the&#xD;
important events in which he had been engaged,&#xD;
and fell insensible. His nervous temperament&#xD;
and sense of respectability could hold out -no&#xD;
longer against the terrible shattering they had&#xD;
received, and his nephew was not relieved from&#xD;
apprehension for the safety of both his mental&#xD;
and physical constitution for two or three day'&#xD;
thereafter.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
LUCID TIEWS OF MR. BARNARD UPON MARRIAGE.&#xD;
WE may say that Mr. Toplady, for the first&#xD;
time in his life, at least since-well, since his&#xD;
boyhood, yielded to the witchery of a young and&#xD;
charming woman. In his visit to Mr. Wagbuill's&#xD;
with Moses, upon which occasion he met with&#xD;
the dignified Miss De Pompenkops, he became as&#xD;
it were unconsciously, and in spite of himself,&#xD;
interested in her. That the charm worked grad-&#xD;
ually and subtly upon him there is no doubt, for it&#xD;
was not until he found himself unconsciously&#xD;
studying the polish of manners, and all the minor&#xD;
arts of society, that he reflected there was cer-&#xD;
tainly some particular object for his enthusiasm,&#xD;
some passionate ardor, of which such conduct&#xD;
was the result. Was he, Toplady, in love at first&#xD;
sight ? And was that love tlie fervor and intoxica-&#xD;
tion which shows 'how little reality it possesses&#xD;
by the ease with which it is forgotten, a mere&#xD;
effervescence ? He would see whether it was, and&#xD;
he determined to call immediately upon the proud&#xD;
-descendant of the old Dutch vegetable family,&#xD;
and ask of his own conduct there a solution of&#xD;
1 the question. He did so, but she was out, and&#xD;
he left his card. Still he found his feelings&#xD;

&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD.-63&#xD;
&#xD;
" Suppose-we drop in a moment at Mr. Wag&#xD;
bull's," suggested Moses, as they neared that&#xD;
gentleman's residence.  "Miss Wagbull, with&#xD;
out doubt, is at home."&#xD;
"I haven't been there but once since New.&#xD;
Year's," replied Mr, Barnard. "She undertakes&#xD;
to lecture me, every time I go there, and I must&#xD;
say I-am behind in the course. Suppose we go&#xD;
in and take another."&#xD;
They entered and learned that Miss Wagbull&#xD;
would presently descend, the grandmother, in&#xD;
the mean time, promptly furnishing them with&#xD;
her society, and suggesting that they might con-&#xD;
sequently deem that of her grand-daughter super.&#xD;
fluous. Moses deferentially intimated to the old&#xD;
lady, that perhaps her own time was too valuable&#xD;
to be expended for their pleasure.&#xD;
"He means if'lie had fifty years more of expe-&#xD;
rience and knowledge, he might be able to enter-&#xD;
tain you in return, madam," said Mr. Barnard&#xD;
respectfully.&#xD;
"Who are you, young man?" asked the old&#xD;
lady, turning to him. "What do you want&#xD;
here -"&#xD;
"Oh ! nothing, ma'am !" replied Mr. Barnard&#xD;
somewhat abashed.I&#xD;
"Your society is not objectionable," continued&#xD;
the old lady, "as long as you respect the laws of&#xD;
decorum. If you behave yourself, you are wel-&#xD;
come to this house, sir !"&#xD;
" Thank you, madam, for your hospitality,"&#xD;
said Mr. Barnard, courteously coughing to hide&#xD;
his disposition to feel lively at the old lady's ex-&#xD;
pense.&#xD;
"What is the matter? Got a cold ?" asked&#xD;
the old lady immediately.  "Take catnip and&#xD;
pennyroyal in equal parts. It's in the head, I see,&#xD;
young man. That's where most young people of&#xD;
the present day are weak."&#xD;
" Ha! ha! Very good. Very good, madam !"&#xD;
cried Mr. Barnard, approving of the old lady's&#xD;
remark as an eminent piece of wit.&#xD;
. What do you mean by this senseless gig-&#xD;
gling ?" asked the old lady, vigorously resenting&#xD;
this disrespectful familiarity.&#xD;
"Oh! nothing, madam; excuse me," replied&#xD;
Mr. Barnard, again feeling much abashed.&#xD;
If it gets on the chest, young man," continued&#xD;
the old lady, reverting to the cough, "take&#xD;
some elder-flowers, one ounce of oak of Jeru-&#xD;
salem and the north side of a maple-tree, and boil&#xD;
'em till they simmer."&#xD;
" But, my dear madam, I assure you I am not&#xD;
at all troubled !" cried Mr. Barnard, at once en-&#xD;
deavoring to relieve the old lady.. I&#xD;
"Drink the tea, and put the remainder as a&#xD;
poultice on your chest," continued the old lady&#xD;
instructively.&#xD;
"But how do you get at the north side of the&#xD;
maple-tree, so as to be able to boil it with the&#xD;
other ingredients ?" asked Barnard, becoming&#xD;
curiou..&#xD;
Where are your wits?  Can't you scrape the&#xD;
moss from a tree ?" continued the old lady pet-&#xD;
tishly.&#xD;
Oh !" said Barnard, much relieved.&#xD;
"It grows on the north side to protect the&#xD;
tree from the cold winds," continued the old lady,&#xD;
with the quiet grandeur of one imparting im-&#xD;
portant information. .&#xD;
The entrance of Miss Wagbull gave Mr. Bar-&#xD;
nard an opportunity of reflecting upon this valu-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
able knowledge, as the old lady devoted her&#xD;
t whole attention, for a few moments thereafter,&#xD;
- to casting severe frowns at Moses, and endea-&#xD;
voring by violent interruptions to impede the&#xD;
progress of his conversation with her grand-&#xD;
daughter. Finally she was diverted by quite a&#xD;
series of coughs upon the part of Mr. Barnard,&#xD;
undoubtedly feigned from  friendly motives to&#xD;
Moses by that ingenious individual.&#xD;
" "Young man! that is not a cold you have. It&#xD;
is not a cold at all ! It is not natural enough for&#xD;
a regular cough," said she quickly. "You need&#xD;
a vermifuge, young man! You undoubtedly&#xD;
need a vermifuge."&#xD;
" But I'm grown !" suggested the astonished&#xD;
Mr. Barnard, rubbing his nose incredulously.&#xD;
"I can't help that. Grown people have 'em,&#xD;
and I know it. There you are rubbing your&#xD;
nose! It is one of the very signs of 'em I" con-&#xD;
tinued she triumphantly.&#xD;
" Your knowledge is much superior to mine in&#xD;
this matter, madam," replied Mr. Barnard sub-&#xD;
missively. ("By Jove, she may be right ! It&#xD;
may account for my seeing snakes now and&#xD;
then !")&#xD;
Here the aged being, to sustain her position&#xD;
of adults being visited l y infantile diseases, went&#xD;
into a long account of one, who had been care-&#xD;
fully kept in his infancy and childhood by his&#xD;
parents from any liability to contract the dis-&#xD;
eases contingent thereto, and in consequence, o&#xD;
the day after he was twenty-one, was attacked&#xD;
with measles, scarlet-fever, thrush and whooping-&#xD;
cough, all at once. To this, Mr. Barnard con-&#xD;
tinued to pay great attention, and as the old lady&#xD;
insisted upon giving him the entire treatment&#xD;
of the difficult case, was much impressed with&#xD;
her knowledge of such matters.   Moses thus&#xD;
secured an opportunity of enjoying Bessie's&#xD;
society without fear of interruption.&#xD;
The young lady had delayed In appearing&#xD;
somewhat longer than usual, owing to the fact,&#xD;
perhaps, that she was becoming more unsatisfied&#xD;
with her toilet than formerly, and was disposed&#xD;
to have every minute particular passed upon in&#xD;
the critical judgment of her maid, before descend-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
" I have been studying so hard," said she&#xD;
to Moses, with a smile.  "All the morning!,&#xD;
You would not think it of me, would you ?"&#xD;
"Why not? What have you been studying,&#xD;
Miss Bessie ?" asked Moses.&#xD;
"I have commenced Kant's Critique and-"&#xD;
"Kant ! Metaphysics ! Why, what has in-&#xD;
duced you to try that ?" asked Moses curiously.&#xD;
"I don't know. Women know so little nowa-&#xD;
days, and they have but little right to lie respect&#xD;
of men who are so superiorly educated," replied&#xD;
Bessie, looking down.&#xD;
"But metaphysics, Bessie! Do you think&#xD;
women should know metaphysics also, to render&#xD;
them worthy of men's homage and friendship !"&#xD;
"I well know that the cultivation of our&#xD;
minds," continued Bessie, "is to fit us for the&#xD;
noble duties of that life, which our constitution&#xD;
marks as the sacred designation of Providence.&#xD;
Our knowledge is to be chiefly reproduced in the&#xD;
daily habits of a domestic life; but if we are in-&#xD;
tended to he the companions of men, how can we&#xD;
hope to be, to those with whom we are-unable to&#xD;
talk, to those who feel themselves constantly&#xD;
obliged to forego the utterance of their own cle-&#xD;

actedd ideas and lower themselves to the common-&#xD;
place level of what, alas, is too well known to be&#xD;
our sex's daily thoughts "&#xD;
" 1Yet even so," replied Moses, "1the society of&#xD;
woman is.beneficial to man. It is a relaxation,&#xD;
a spiritual restoration from the intense thought,&#xD;
or exhausting labor, which falls to his lot in the&#xD;
discharge of his duties."&#xD;
" But is this hardly fair for her ?" asked Bessie.&#xD;
"She does not stand in need of the relaxation&#xD;
which severe application or overwhelming busi-&#xD;
ness makes requisite for him. Her employments&#xD;
do not exhaust her spirits. Should the strong,&#xD;
truths, which she longs to hear drop from his lips,&#xD;
be diluted with flattery, should her desire for in-&#xD;
formation be put off with a compliment instead&#xD;
of a fact or reason ?"71&#xD;
"oNo; and when she indicates a relish for in-&#xD;
structive conversation, that of men, even the less&#xD;
distinguished for sense and learning, will not be&#xD;
apt to be confined to what is vain and unprofit-&#xD;
able," replied Moses.&#xD;
abl must confess, that we too often think to&#xD;
flatter the understanding of men by avoiding the&#xD;
exercise of our own, but it is only to recommend&#xD;
ourselves in the eyes of those, whom it is our duty&#xD;
to please !" replied B~essie earnestly.&#xD;
tBessie ,it is not the relaxation of frivolous&#xD;
trifling, nor the discussion of intellectual abstrac-&#xD;
tions, that man seeks in her society; it is an ele&#xD;
eating power, a spirituality, with which it is her&#xD;
province to endow him by her smiles and love&#xD;
and for which he may seek in vain amid the ab-&#xD;
stractions of philosophy, the truths of science, or&#xD;
the practical deductions of reason," replied Moses&#xD;
With chivalrous gentleness. " In her conversa&#xD;
tion, he would see her fancy flourish, her sensibil&#xD;
cities expand, her wit guided by delicacy and&#xD;
taste, on subject interesting to the heart and tc&#xD;
.the imgination."&#xD;
"B 1ut if the study of abstractions gives exact&#xD;
ness to the ideas, produces definite notions of&#xD;
realities, chastens the imagination,leads to think&#xD;
to analyze, to combine and to methodize; if&#xD;
confers a power to discriminate the glitterin,&#xD;
from the solid, the false from the true, are no&#xD;
such virtues required in domestic life, and is no&#xD;
such a study fitted to strengthen woman's wind&#xD;
' to put her in the best state for directing her pu&#xD;
suits in those particular channels, which her dec&#xD;
tination requires ?"&#xD;
"tAr! yes," replied Moses, now in deep appri&#xD;
bation - " and with such an end, she runs no ria&#xD;
of being seemed a precieuse -idicule,.a blue-stoel&#xD;
ing affected with pedantry. The most profoun&#xD;
metaphysical disquisitions or tempestuous the&#xD;
logical polemics are thus without danger to h&#xD;
womanliness, and it is thus men of sense w:&#xD;
cease to be hostile to her improvement."&#xD;
"I thought also of attending more assiduous&#xD;
to the lectures of the day than I have," continue&#xD;
Bessie.&#xD;
"1And you are quite right," interrupted Mose&#xD;
"for I well know that you will not resort to their&#xD;
with the fashionable hope of appearing well-i&#xD;
formed, by cheaply substituting the exciteme&#xD;
of public amusement for the fatigue of applicati&#xD;
-that you will not seek the diverting graces&#xD;
rhetoric instead of the deductions of reasomn,t&#xD;
esthetic gratification instead of substantial i&#xD;
provement !"&#xD;
"Do tell me what a woman should best hi&#xD;
&#xD;
INKFIE2JTLDT.&#xD;
&#xD;
continued Bessie with an air of innocent perplex-&#xD;
ity. "It is so hard to steer between being a vain&#xD;
pedant by reading too much and a vain fool by&#xD;
reading nothing."&#xD;
"Let the poet answer for me," replied Moses,&#xD;
gently tempering his critical spirit with the elo-&#xD;
quent r6sum6 of Mr. Wordsworth.&#xD;
As he finished the lines, a modest languor ap-&#xD;
peared in her manner, a timid sensibility seemed&#xD;
to express itself in her look. The silent tender-&#xD;
ness of this enchanting expressiveness seemed&#xD;
but to adorn the correctness of the sentiments,&#xD;
which she had disclosed were innate within her.&#xD;
Moses looked upon her fine brow across which&#xD;
her hair waved in heavy billows to float around&#xD;
her neok, and felt that the soft ringlets, which&#xD;
art could not hold captive, the fineness, the velvet-&#xD;
like coloring of flowers, which her complexion&#xD;
possessed, the regularity of her features, which&#xD;
discovered new attractions in every expression,&#xD;
were a fitting adornment of the temple which&#xD;
contained so noble a soul. The philosophic se-&#xD;
renity of his mind seemed scarcely to afford relief&#xD;
or resource in the momentary intoxication of his&#xD;
heart. It has been said by gifted writers that it&#xD;
is in truth an awful moment, when a human being&#xD;
first discovers, that his passions and affections&#xD;
are stronger than his talents and intellectual&#xD;
powers-when he first begins to suspect their&#xD;
vast importance in the sum of his existence-&#xD;
when he first feels that his happiness is no longer&#xD;
in his own keeping, but is surrendered into the&#xD;
- dominion of another.&#xD;
r    But awful as this moment was to our hero, it&#xD;
s is our duty to record that the one succeeding it&#xD;
- was still more awful to him, hero as he was.&#xD;
- , "I love Wordsworth," murmured Bessie, after&#xD;
d a pause, looking up. "Do you know, Alfred and&#xD;
o I studied the whole Excursion together ?"&#xD;
"Alfred and you! I beg pardon," exclaimed&#xD;
- our hero, "but may I ask who Alfred'is ?"'&#xD;
f Oh! Mr. Hoyt, our neighbor, whom you met&#xD;
, at the opera and at dinner the other evening t"&#xD;
it replied Bessie cheerfully.&#xD;
g    "Hoyt! Oh ! yes, I remember iim," said our&#xD;
t hero, endeavoring to feign composure.&#xD;
it   "He has such a clear conception of poetry and&#xD;
d, he reads so beautifully !" continued Bessie in in-&#xD;
r- nocent enthusaism.&#xD;
S-   Moses felt inclined to, wish that the amiable&#xD;
Alfred had never been born; to hate the very&#xD;
o. letters of which that person's name was com-&#xD;
Ik posed!   He presently betook himself to the&#xD;
k- street, accompanied by Mr. Barnard, who had&#xD;
Ld quite penetrated the old lady's graces, by faith-&#xD;
o-* fully listening tb her thrilling recital of the&#xD;
er troubles and narrow escapes of the infant of&#xD;
ill twenty-one. We may say that the five different&#xD;
crises which the latter had passed through, of as&#xD;

homeward. What his feelings were on his way&#xD;
home we do not know, but we imagine that as&#xD;
his torture was now a thing of the past, and the&#xD;
sympathy of the young lady still glowed in his&#xD;
memory, he finally thought more of the latter&#xD;
than he did of the former.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXTL&#xD;
MIs STACY SEEKS THE cONFIDENCE OF MR. TITMAN&#xD;
MR. HYPERINoN RUNSWIcK DIFFIcULTS.&#xD;
TnE impression left upon our hero by the un&#xD;
usual warmth of Miss Stacy's friendship, by th&#xD;
mixture of playfulness and sensibility, and wha&#xD;
the French call naivete, was like, so to speak&#xD;
that of delicious strains of musio. lie discover&#xD;
ed in his being a depth of delight, which pe&#xD;
plexed him by its very inexpressibility. We wil&#xD;
not give here particular passages, as they had&#xD;
relative beauty which rendets it difficult to sei&#xD;
arate them from each other  r their surroundin&#xD;
circumstances without barringg their general e&#xD;
feet. Suffice to say that what she said and di&#xD;
in her lively intercourse with him possessed th&#xD;
mingled charm of.pathos and humor. Thong&#xD;
of course, it will be evident to every reader,'&#xD;
was not at all from being overpowered' by theic&#xD;
demonstrations that Moses had transferred hi&#xD;
lodgings from the hotel to Bank street, it neve&#xD;
- theless happened. that by this means she can&#xD;
much less in contact with him, being deprived&#xD;
his society to such a degree as. to induce her&#xD;
seek temporary consolation therefor in that off&#xD;
elderly Cuban gentleman, of large possession&#xD;
who had lately arrived in the metropolis. Bu&#xD;
that our readers may observe the constancy o&#xD;
her friendship for our hero, notwithstanding th&#xD;
we will report a brief conversation which she h&#xD;
with Mr. Titman, about the period of Moses'sr&#xD;
turn to the Evercroft House.&#xD;
Mr. Titman had been kindly amusing theI&#xD;
dies of the hotel, one evening, in its parlor, by&#xD;
chaste performance upon that excellent instr&#xD;
meant, the accordeon, in whose varied and coi&#xD;
prehensive capacities he was a skillful adel&#xD;
One by one the audience had gradually left&#xD;
the conclusion of the entertainment, no dou&#xD;
unfortunately called away by pressing duties&#xD;
engagements, until she was left to enjoy his&#xD;
&#xD;
ciety and musical abilities alone. Though she&#xD;
also appeared to be frequently reminded of mat-&#xD;
ters which required her presence elsewhere, and&#xD;
more than once seemed resolved upon leaving;&#xD;
she, nevertheless, forewent duty for pleasure,&#xD;
and remained in company with the accomplish-&#xD;
ed artist until he had finished his repertoire.&#xD;
She had another motive for lingering than her&#xD;
desire for the sensuous excitement afforded by&#xD;
Mr. Titman's performance. As he triumphantly&#xD;
placed his instrument in its box, she compli-&#xD;
mented him not only upon his artistic skill, but&#xD;
upon his general intelligence, sensibility, refined&#xD;
manners, generosity, friendship, and various&#xD;
other virtues of cbracter. Whereupon Mr. Tit-&#xD;
man very properly endeavored to corroborate&#xD;
the correctness of her remarks, by attempting on&#xD;
the spot an arduous compound expression and&#xD;
bearing illustrative of these numerous character-&#xD;
"Ah! life itself, with its various amusements,&#xD;
duties, struggles, and disappointments, is amys-&#xD;
terious instrument, is it not ." continued she,&#xD;
after she had again referred to his late musical&#xD;
effort.&#xD;
"It is," said Mr. Titman, who was waitmg o&#xD;
see how she made it out.&#xD;
"T hosehamusements, struggles, pains, hopes&#xD;
and fears are so many keys upon whicn we are&#xD;
called to play," said Miss Stacy.&#xD;
" Yes, and a good many people are not allow-&#xD;
ed to play on any but the minor scale," observed&#xD;
Mr. Titman, apprehending her idea.&#xD;
' Very true, sir. It is alas!1 true," said. Miss&#xD;
Stacy, with a sigh, "I would hardly wish to in-&#xD;
e clude myself among such, but-"&#xD;
t  "What! have you pains, struggles, and fears&#xD;
, too ?" asked Mr. Titman, gallantly. "I would&#xD;
r- hardly have thought so bright a character de-&#xD;
r- served them."&#xD;
LI  "I appreciate your sympathy, Mr. Titman, al-&#xD;
a though I am aware your feelings are prepossess-&#xD;
p- ed in favor of another. Yes, I have a pain aud&#xD;
ig disorder I"&#xD;
g diso   ow  me," exclaimed Mr. Titman.   "Of&#xD;
 -           ,,,,ow   -e&#xD;
d what nature -"&#xD;
le   "A general restlessness of spirit, an eagerness&#xD;
h for that which I have not, a trembling suspense&#xD;
it of being, a weakness at times of-"&#xD;
e   o Then let me recommend to you a bottle of&#xD;
is Radway's Relief. Undoubtedly a disorder of the&#xD;
r- nervous system, originating in some slight bilious&#xD;
ne derangement-"&#xD;
of     Sir I"&#xD;
to    "It is an excellent restorative, and refreshes&#xD;
an, the system. The advertisement says so, at any&#xD;
is, rate !"&#xD;
it,   "You mistake me, sir 1" said Miss Stacy with&#xD;
f  some feeling. ."You mistake me. It is spirit-&#xD;
is, ual I mean, a disorder of the sensibilities 1"&#xD;
ad    "Ahl! Oh! Excuse me. I thought you re-&#xD;
re- ferred to a physical affection. I beg pardon,&#xD;
Miss Stacy."&#xD;
la-  "And alas, it is one which perhaps too great-&#xD;
y a ly needs tre kind confidence and sympathy of&#xD;
ru- some generous friend," continued she.&#xD;
m-    "Why not mine?    I would be proud to offer&#xD;
pt. it," responded Mr. Titman.&#xD;
tre " The object, w-th which these feelings may be&#xD;
Lbt said to be somewhat connected is a near and in-&#xD;
or timate associate of yours. Yes, perhaps I a&#xD;
so- judicious in confiding in you1&#xD;
&#xD;
" Very right, madam, very right. And that&#xD;
associate is, I may ask-"&#xD;
"Mr. Winkfield."&#xD;
"Winkfield! why, what has he been doing "&#xD;
exclaimed Mr. Titman, much interested. "Ex-&#xD;
cuse me, but what relations-"&#xD;
" Dear me, I would reveal my delicate posi-&#xD;
tion to you, Mr. Titman, but it is with the in-&#xD;
junction of the strictest confidence "&#xD;
"Certainly."-&#xD;
"And it is for his benefit, you know, the ben-&#xD;
efit of one in whom you are so deeply interest-&#xD;
ed, as well as myself, that I have dared to dis-&#xD;
close it to you."I&#xD;
We can not resist the opportunity of observing&#xD;
here that never was there, perhaps, a more beau-&#xD;
tiful picture of a woman's love, cherished in se-&#xD;
cret, not self-consuming in silent languishment,&#xD;
not pining in thought, not passive and despond-&#xD;
Ing as she asserted, but patient and hopeful,&#xD;
strong in its own intensity and sustained by its&#xD;
own fond faith, that either Moses or the Cuban&#xD;
gentleman was destined to become hers. So in re-&#xD;
sponse to Mr. Titman's earnest request to pro-&#xD;
ceed, she continued:&#xD;
"4I have done this solely for your advice. A&#xD;
Cuban gentleman (spare me the necessity of men-&#xD;
tioning his name upon my assuring you of his&#xD;
undoubted refinement and exquisite sensibility-&#xD;
a sensibility ever tropical in its nature, Mr. Tit-&#xD;
man) has rendered me such attentions lately as&#xD;
have really caused me much anxiety regarding my&#xD;
connection with his future happiness. Oh I spare&#xD;
my blushes, my agitation ! To be plain, I can not&#xD;
decide if I could rightly give him my hand ere I&#xD;
have ascertained that I should not give unneces-&#xD;
sary pain thereby to another, to your noble&#xD;
friend, Mr Winkfield."&#xD;
"I do not know, madam. I only know that&#xD;
were I in Mr. Winkfield's place, it would give&#xD;
me pain !" replied Mr. Titman gallantly. "I am&#xD;
unacquainted with his sentiments, but as a friend&#xD;
of Mr. Winkfield, Miss Stacy, I should advise&#xD;
you not to give your hand to the Spanish gen-&#xD;
tleman !"&#xD;
" I thank you. You relieve my feelings. Ah!&#xD;
perhaps I have said too much. Surely, you will&#xD;
not reveal this conversation to Mr. Winkfield ?"&#xD;
"Certainly not, as it is a matter of confi-&#xD;
dence."'&#xD;
d"nYou, no doubt, might thereby confer a ben-&#xD;
efit upon him which he ardently wishes, but you&#xD;
do not think of such a step, I hope ?"&#xD;
"Oh! no, certainly not !"&#xD;
"There would be a definite solution.of the&#xD;
matter, anid I should be entirely relieved of my&#xD;
disagreeable suspense, if you informed him that&#xD;
a gentleman from Cuba, at present in New-York,&#xD;
stopping at the Brevoort House, and frequenting&#xD;
the Evercroft Hotel-I disclose his name, the&#xD;
Senor Flor do Cabanas--has wished to identify&#xD;
his happiness with mine ; but I hope it is not&#xD;
your intention of doing any thing of this kind."&#xD;
" By no means. Rest assured in my perfect&#xD;
silence and discretion, Miss Stacy !"1&#xD;
" You would render your friendship with him&#xD;
much stronger, and no doubt produce a display of&#xD;
his gratitude at some future time; but this, assur-&#xD;
edly, will not influence you ?"&#xD;
" Well, as you wish it, no. Certainly, no. I&#xD;
will not," replied Mr. Titman, slightly wavering&#xD;
at this point.,&#xD;
&#xD;
nYou, perhaps, feel it your dutyenotwithstand.&#xD;
ing. You may, perhaps, feel it your duty at some&#xD;
moment hereafter to do so, or may, quite natu-&#xD;
rally, divulge it to him in an unguarded moment;&#xD;
but do not, I beg of you."&#xD;
"Never   Rely upon my faithfulness, Miss&#xD;
Stacy!"&#xD;
And Mr. Titman was faithful in his guardian-&#xD;
ship of this delicate secret, for Moses never heard&#xD;
the slightest word in any way whatever upon the&#xD;
subject from him, and the little man thus showed&#xD;
a power of reticence which was reAlly wonderful&#xD;
in him, and which Miss Stacy, perhaps, hardly&#xD;
expected from his somewhat unstablecharacter,&#xD;
when she revealed it to him.&#xD;
But if she failed in this attack uponhim, she&#xD;
was still indefatigable. She endeavored to induce&#xD;
the proprietor of the hotel to speak to Moses&#xD;
about it, when he settled his bill; and although&#xD;
this worthy person failed too, through forgetful-&#xD;
ness resulting from business cares, her constancy&#xD;
was unflinching in furthering her twofold deter-&#xD;
mination of purpose.&#xD;
On returning to the hotel, Moses concluded, as&#xD;
a matter of economy, to take exclusively into his&#xD;
service one of the colored waiters, instead of&#xD;
keeping three -or four, as Mr. Toplady did, in the&#xD;
disguise of house-servants. There was one who&#xD;
had much pleased our hero by the faithfulness&#xD;
with which he had attended to numerous little&#xD;
wants and errands, and inquiring into his relia-&#xD;
bility of the clerk of the hotel, sent for him end&#xD;
made the proposition, which the delighted domes-&#xD;
tic at once accepted.&#xD;
" What is your family name, Brunswick ?"&#xD;
asked Moses of him.&#xD;
1 Hyperion, sir I My full opithet is H 'yperon&#xD;
Brunswick Difficults. My author's name was&#xD;
Previous Difficults," replied the domestic loqua-&#xD;
ciously. "Very odd name, sir! All my male an-&#xD;
cestorial relatives have borne it, and my eldest&#xD;
brother in the navy bears it now."&#xD;
Moses thought it was a very odd appellation,&#xD;
and in reflecting for the moment upon it, imag-&#xD;
ined it might have been originally bestowed&#xD;
upon the great common stock of the family, by&#xD;
some African chief or sovereign, perhaps, to com-&#xD;
memorate troubles, into which the maternalcpar-&#xD;
ent of the stock had been plunged and extricated&#xD;
from, previous to his birth. He then requested&#xD;
Brunswick, who was poltely making iarfeint of&#xD;
arranging the room in order to remain, to pro-&#xD;
ceed with further particulars of his fam1ily and&#xD;
race.&#xD;
"vMy father was of very playful disposition, sir;&#xD;
used to come home and break all the furniture&#xD;
for sport.  He was a fisherman," continued&#xD;
Brunswick. "Used to bob for eels in Wallabout&#xD;
bay, and sell them in the markets, sir. One day,&#xD;
extremely auspicious for his piscatorial pursuits,&#xD;
when it was raining, he was out in the bay, and&#xD;
feeling as it were uncomfortable for to bail the&#xD;
boat, he extricated a plug in the bottom to ex-&#xD;
clude the water out troo the orifice, and the water&#xD;
permeating through the aperture back agin,&#xD;
swamped the vessel, sir. My mother-in-law seen&#xD;
him from the door, but 'twant no use. He had&#xD;
as high as ten pounds of leadinto his pocket, and&#xD;
Ie went down to wunst"&#xD;
" Ah !" said Moses, sympathizing with his do:&#xD;
maestic at the sad loss.&#xD;
" The boat was washed ashore," continued the&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;

&#xD;
latter. "We picked it up. It was jest as good&#xD;
as ever, all except the plug, sir. Jest as good as,&#xD;
the first day it was made !"&#xD;
"Ahem! yes."&#xD;
"I wish he was alive now. I jest wish he was&#xD;
a-livin !" said the domestic after a pause, in a kind&#xD;
of subdued fury. " Wouldn't he swat that ere&#xD;
Jinks across the snodgin ?"&#xD;
" Eh! What?   What is that?  What is the&#xD;
snodgin ?"&#xD;
" I mean, as it were, jest to revenge himself&#xD;
upon his protuberance, his nasal protuberance,&#xD;
sir !"&#xD;
"Why, what would he do that for ?" inquired&#xD;
the master, benevolently noticing the deep feel-&#xD;
ing with which the remark was emendatdd by his&#xD;
servant. "And who is Jinks, Brunswick ?"&#xD;
" That's what I'd like to tell you, if you please,&#xD;
sir. I thought I ought to tell you, before I en-&#xD;
gaged myself to you, sir, as I get sometimes wild,&#xD;
and you might think it was caused by something&#xD;
else."&#xD;
"Very true, Brunswick. Proceed."&#xD;
"This is one of my bad days. He was around&#xD;
there this mornin'. I seed 'em a talking together&#xD;
for over an hour in the wash-shed. His name is&#xD;
Jinks, but he's romantic, and has took on his&#xD;
mother's name, which is Lommeydew, and he's&#xD;
been courting' around mother-in-law ever since&#xD;
about a month after the old gentleman went the&#xD;
last time a-bobbing."&#xD;
" Ah! your step-mother ?"&#xD;
4 Yes, my own mother deceased in my infancy,&#xD;
sir. He's jist as if he belonged to the other sect;&#xD;
'scuse the allusion, sir. Talking poetry and knit-&#xD;
ting, and eating and drinking with fluency, and&#xD;
studying for the ministry. That's the way he&#xD;
comes it over her, to use a familiar phrase. All&#xD;
the females of Shiloh are mad after him. She's&#xD;
a good creature, and enjoys their envy, and thinks&#xD;
he means what he says. When he gets to eatin'&#xD;
and drinkin', he means what he does, certainly.&#xD;
It's a kind of disease with him. He comes there&#xD;
almost every day at dinner, when he doesn't come&#xD;
in the morning to stay all day. She's eating&#xD;
nothing and looking at him tenderly; and he's&#xD;
all the while smiling at her, while he is hoeing&#xD;
the food in heaps and shoveling it down his&#xD;
thote I  And no liquor better be kept around&#xD;
handy neither. Two or three times I've seen him&#xD;
when he's come there in his fits, as he calls them;&#xD;
fits froni his sensitive nature to poetry and reli-&#xD;
gion, sir! 'Scuse me, sir," continued the unhappy&#xD;
domestic, making an unconscious grasp at the&#xD;
poker in his indignation.  "I could just take&#xD;
and-"'&#xD;
" Calm yourself, Brunswick  said Moses, much&#xD;
interested. " This is all, perhaps, very natural,&#xD;
and your feelings1too, are natural; but'you must&#xD;
remember that it is exceedingly common for la-&#xD;
dies, who have been once bereaved; to seek a&#xD;
second object for their affections. And perhaps&#xD;
it is a wise dispensation that such should be the&#xD;
case, and indeed the wisdom, too, seems mostly&#xD;
on the side of the lady."&#xD;
"All he wants is her money. The old gentle-&#xD;
man left her somethin', and she is industrious in&#xD;
washing, until she's tuck in several hundred dol.&#xD;
lars, and lie knows it. You may think, perhaps&#xD;
I'd like to get it, but it is not that. No, it's be.&#xD;
cause he's deceivin' her all the time, until he eanr&#xD;
jest get lawful holt on that cre sum. I can'1&#xD;
&#xD;
kick him out, for he'd only make out to her he&#xD;
was abused, and she'd go in for good and run&#xD;
away with him. As 'tis, if I say nothin' when I&#xD;
go there, and don't do nothin' more than go&#xD;
scowlin' about, neither of 'em mind me, and&#xD;
things go on jest about the same. Fortnitly, as&#xD;
she knows what the difference is, she seems to&#xD;
like courtship better than bein' married. It's&#xD;
been going' on now about four years !"&#xD;
"Your course is very judicious, Brunswick,"&#xD;
said Moses; "but may you not have been mis-&#xD;
taken in judging of the relations between them ?&#xD;
May she not consider it her duty to extend her&#xD;
hospitality to him as a member of the religious&#xD;
society to which she belongs, or even in ordinary&#xD;
friendship, which is so delightful to see, even&#xD;
though it be mistaken sometimes ?"&#xD;
"No, sir," replied Brunswick, continuing fixed&#xD;
in his disgust. "Ef I've seen 'em once, I've seen&#xD;
'em fifty times a-huggin' of each other, and she&#xD;
appears to do the most of it."&#xD;
This seemed conclusive evidence to Moses, and&#xD;
he proceeded:&#xD;
" But still you must not permit your feelings&#xD;
,to get the better of your judgment, Brunswick.&#xD;
If this object of her affections is really unworthy&#xD;
of them, I will assist you in your honorable and&#xD;
filial endeavor to wean her from them, or at least&#xD;
to impress her with his true character, ere she&#xD;
takes the fatal step. Has any thing occurred&#xD;
lately, which you think demands our immediate&#xD;
attention, Brunswick ?"&#xD;
" Oh! no, sir, only I left him this mornin',&#xD;
while she was gone away to carry home her wash,&#xD;
suckin' eggs in the hen-house in&#xD;
"Very well, at any time when you desire to&#xD;
converse with me on this subject, you may,&#xD;
Brunswick. And you can now brush my clothes&#xD;
and leave."&#xD;
" Thank you, sir," replied the gratified Bruns-&#xD;
wick, touching his forelock.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
A NOCTURNAL ADVENTURE.&#xD;
Ma. WINKFIELD Well knew his friend Titman's&#xD;
susceptibility to female influence, but lie was not&#xD;
aware of the extent to which the latter's imagi-&#xD;
nation got the better of his memory in his con-&#xD;
fessions thereon. In fact, Titman did not know&#xD;
it himself, and his case upon this matter. was,&#xD;
no doubt, another instance of the curious anom-&#xD;
aly that men can sometimes enthusiastically per-&#xD;
suade themselves, as well as others, into a belief&#xD;
that they are veracious when' they are not strict-&#xD;
lV so.&#xD;
Moses had returned from the Arebmological&#xD;
Rooms to his. lodgings at the Evercroft House,&#xD;
after assisting at a quiet unrolling and examina-&#xD;
tion of a damaged female mummy by that learn-,&#xD;
ed Egyptian scholar, the librarian, in the latter's&#xD;
private office; the said mummy being a kind of&#xD;
unofficial and private luxury, which the librarian&#xD;
had bought for himself out of an importation,&#xD;
- anid as a special favor permitted Moses to assist&#xD;
,in decorticating. The research had been ex-&#xD;
- tremely thorough, and the perplexing fact that&#xD;
they had found within the envelop on the mum-&#xD;
tmy's head a crushed Parisian hat having led to&#xD;
&#xD;
NKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
73&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WI&#xD;
a prolonged and indecisive colloquy, Moses was&#xD;
quite exhausted. He was therefore much pleas-&#xD;
ed to find Mr., Titman in his parlor, and in that&#xD;
gentleman's society to turn his thoughts for the&#xD;
while from th'e profound researches of historical&#xD;
science to the commoner events of daily exist-&#xD;
ence. Titman appeared to have something un-&#xD;
common to talk about, however.&#xD;
" What is the matter ?" asked Moses, noticing&#xD;
his air.I&#xD;
" There are moments," replied Titman with&#xD;
much solemnity, "when the  Ian becoming at&#xD;
once a hero and a slave is, as, it were, consider-&#xD;
ing those points, a-a-heroic in his tendencies,&#xD;
and as it were-but, perhaps if is better for me&#xD;
to reveal to you at once the circumstances which&#xD;
have surrounded me during the past week !"&#xD;
" That is right, of course, go on at once," said&#xD;
Moses in a sympathetic voice from his dressing-&#xD;
room, while washing his hands.&#xD;
"Last Sunday, Moses," commenced Mr. Tit-&#xD;
man, "I was invited by a young friend of mine,&#xD;
an artist from Boston, by the name of Giovanni&#xD;
Brown, to make a passing call with him upon a&#xD;
wealthy gentleman's family residing in Madlison&#xD;
avenue, for whom he had lately been doing some&#xD;
fine paintings.  Moses, the young  lady, the&#xD;
daughter of the family was the only one who&#xD;
happened to be at home! Singular fatality!&#xD;
But let me go on quickly," continued the ardent&#xD;
Thomas. "I will not rehearse the numerous&#xD;
manifestations of regard observable in her con-&#xD;
duct.  At this moment I sacredly withhold&#xD;
them, as-as sacred even-even from your con-&#xD;
fidence, Moses, and I am sure of your appreciat.&#xD;
ing my delicacy. Suffice it to say, she asked&#xD;
me-to call again! And, 0 Moses-but let me&#xD;
proceed. I did call again-on Wednesday. Her&#xD;
parent was there, the old gentleman. I endeav-&#xD;
ored to behave in a modest, diffident, and unos-&#xD;
tentatious way, and his sweet daughter received&#xD;
me in an extremely courteous manner. Her&#xD;
large black eyes swam with an unusual fustre,&#xD;
but he had most unfortunately imbibed the no-&#xD;
tion that I was a tufthunter, or something of that&#xD;
sort. I am  sure of it. In fact, Moses," con-&#xD;
tinued Titman, in a depressed way, " he--he, so to&#xD;
say, pitched into me and defied me. Gracious I I&#xD;
was so astonished at this unexpected thing I&#xD;
was taken with a vertigo, and became so dizzy as&#xD;
nearly to tumble off my chair. Miss Williams,&#xD;
that's her name, endeavored to change her fath-&#xD;
er's ungracious behaviour by laughing, and to&#xD;
encourage and reassure me. But I still observ-&#xD;
ed he was partially pacified. He kept his eyes&#xD;
on me in a very suspicious manner all the while&#xD;
he was going out of the room, and in the hall.&#xD;
In fact, Moses; as I noticed. she was obliged to&#xD;
smile at the occasion in spite of herself, I had&#xD;
to get up and back out."&#xD;
"It was extremely awkward," said Moses.&#xD;
" Awkward! It was the hardest time I ever&#xD;
had. He is an irascible, ill-natured old beng,0&#xD;
and it is almost as much as a man's life is worth&#xD;
to enter his house, when he is at home. 0&#xD;
dear ! it is just my fortune ! But I have been&#xD;
again. Moses, I-"&#xD;
" Wait !" exclaimed Moses here. He remem-&#xD;
bered the fickleness which had seized his friend&#xD;
in the affair of the deaf girl in Dibblctown; a&#xD;
ease which resulted in such a fatal manner to the&#xD;
poor girl, and now the tall sisters were being de-&#xD;
&#xD;
serted for this new object. "Before you pro-&#xD;
ceed, Titman, let me know if you are serious this&#xD;
time. Mind, you must know you are serious,&#xD;
confound me if you mustn't," concluded Moses,&#xD;
striking the table vehemently.&#xD;
"Serious, Moses! Yes, I will confess to hav-&#xD;
ing hitherto trifled when I should not. I have&#xD;
perhaps too lightly considered the feelings and&#xD;
hopes of others. But in this, I see the footsteps&#xD;
of destiny before me. They beckon me, that&#xD;
is, destiny beckons me to follow, Moses! We&#xD;

entry of her mansion. She confessed her rash-&#xD;
ness and the precipitancy of the thing, but we&#xD;
both knew the fatality which drove us on."&#xD;
" This is the most extraordinary thing I've ever&#xD;
heard," said Moses, staring at Titman. "After&#xD;
four days' acquaintance, and in -the entry "&#xD;
" Yes ! We would have done it in the parlor,&#xD;
but do you see, her mother was there, and she&#xD;
probably would have put a stop to it," replied&#xD;
Mr. Titinan minutely.&#xD;
" Very well, very wellI" said Moses curtly, for&#xD;
some conscientious doubts about the propriety&#xD;
of such rashness and irregularity were occupying&#xD;
him.&#xD;
There was a meditative silence for a few mo-&#xD;
ments, when Mr. Titman burst forth in the fol-&#xD;
lowing -eloquent description of the lady of his&#xD;
passion, being as much as he could then remem-&#xD;
ber of one of a heroine he once met with in a&#xD;
novel, in Dibbletown:&#xD;
" 0 Moses! you can fancy nothing half so&#xD;
brilliant, so beautiful, so joyous.  Luxuriant&#xD;
tresses of the fairest, most silken texture; eyes&#xD;
blue, and radiant as the heavens from which she&#xD;
descended; checks of-"&#xD;
" Wait a moment," interrupted Moses. "You&#xD;
said her eyes were black a little while ago, and&#xD;
now you say they are blue. You mean black of&#xD;
course, don't you?"&#xD;
"Did I say blue?   I mean black ocoursc,&#xD;
Yes," resumed Mr. Titman, "eyes black as the&#xD;
heavens from which she descended, cheeks of&#xD;
rose, and lips of carnation, a skin white and pol-&#xD;
ished! Ah! you should have seen it-not as&#xD;
marble or snow, nor as satin it seemed - 0&#xD;
Moses! and her form, Moses, by the soft power of&#xD;
Venus, 'twas matchless.  Ha ! the bounding&#xD;
elasticity of the child, and yet the rounded beau-&#xD;
ty of the woman, arms that might serveas models&#xD;
to the sculptor, hands that- looked as if only&#xD;
formed to play with flowers, feet that seem al-&#xD;
most too small to bear the beautiful figure. 0&#xD;

lie was unable to go on, and Moses too was&#xD;
thoroughly overcome. They stood for some time&#xD;
in convulsive silence, supporting each other, until&#xD;
their deep emotion had passed away. When&#xD;
Moses recovered his mind, he applauded his&#xD;
friend's choice. He grasped his hand, and in low&#xD;
tones warmly promised his active friendship and&#xD;
counsel, should it be needed, in assisting him to&#xD;
win this dazzling jewel. Titman then expressed&#xD;
his heartfelt gratification at this new evidence of&#xD;
Moses's sympathy, and promptly followed him in&#xD;
to dinner, The next day, he walked with our&#xD;

aroused, to keep up, as the strains continued, an&#xD;
unceasing inquiry or anguished criticism there-&#xD;
upon. A novel emendation was thus made of&#xD;
the usually charming nocturn, selected for open-&#xD;
ing the occasion, in some such manner as the&#xD;
following:&#xD;
Ort In the stilly night,&#xD;
(Gobble, gobble, gabble,)&#xD;
When slumber's chains have bound me,&#xD;
(Gaobble gobb, gobble gobb, gobble,) etc."&#xD;
The musicians were overpowered with emotion,&#xD;
and their voices quavered. The efforts of such&#xD;
as were naturally less concerned in the ultimate&#xD;
success of the mission, were suffused with a dis-&#xD;
position of laughter; but deep irritation was&#xD;
plainly observable in'the manner of Mr. Wink-&#xD;
field, as well as Mr. Titman's, the latter having&#xD;
but then fairly started in convulsively tossing his&#xD;
instrument in the air, after the approved fashion&#xD;
of supplying it wi   wind. -Besides this, the&#xD;
prompt efforts of Mr. Barnard to dislodge the&#xD;
disagreeable fowls, though praiseworthy, seemed&#xD;
but to hasten the undertaking to an ignominious&#xD;
failure. In addition to the cry of the birds, the&#xD;
frequent passage of brickbats and other missiles&#xD;
through the thick foliage of the trees and their&#xD;
heavy fall upon the ground or the roof of the&#xD;
mansion, while they failed to expel the birds,&#xD;
obliterated what other emotions may have been&#xD;
aroused in the bosoms of the half-awakened occu-&#xD;
pants of the dwelling, by the powerful one of fear.&#xD;
"Hallo !" cried a voice from   a chamber.&#xD;
"Who are you ?   What the d-1 are you doing"j&#xD;
there ?"&#xD;
"'Stop!" said Mr. Winkfield to his companions.&#xD;
"Wait a moment! Hey ?" replied he, rather&#xD;
faintly to the alprupt inquiries of the person in theI&#xD;
chamber.&#xD;
" D-n you, I'll be at you presently " said&#xD;
that individual.&#xD;
"I think we had better go quietly off," here&#xD;
whispered Mr. Titman nervously, beforee they&#xD;
find us out. We can try it again some other&#xD;
night. I think we had better go."&#xD;
I know you, you scoundrels !" again exclaim-&#xD;
ed the now thoroughly aroused gentleman, his&#xD;
theory being confirmed by the -general failure to&#xD;
reply. "Leave those turkeys! Drop'em, I say l"&#xD;
"Really, really, I believe they think we have&#xD;
come here to steal their turkeys I" said Mr. Titman.&#xD;
"IHe does, and it certainly demands an expla-&#xD;
nation," said our hero promptly, feeling that the&#xD;
honor of the party was thus awkwardly involved.&#xD;
"Sir! my dear sir, Mr. Williams," exclaimed&#xD;
he, bespeaking a hush around him, and advancing&#xD;
toward the window, " if you will permit me to--"&#xD;
He was about to proceed, when he observed&#xD;
that the excited gentleman had disappeared from&#xD;
the window. There was a scuffling noise in the&#xD;
chamber, as of a man in a slight difficulty with&#xD;
his pantaloons, and then an apparent rush&#xD;
through the hall to the rear.&#xD;
"Sam! Jim! Good God, thieves! The tur-&#xD;
keys !" were the next words that struck their&#xD;
startled sense, and these were immediately fol-&#xD;
lowed by a concert of two or three females in dis-&#xD;
tressf . .&#xD;
"This is no time for' parley E The whole vil-&#xD;
lage will be in an uproar, before we can satisfy&#xD;
him," -said our hero hastily.- " Good gracious,&#xD;
how unfortunate ! We had better get out of the&#xD;
difficulty by escaping at once" -&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
And with this philosophical solution, he and&#xD;
the two young fire-gentlemen at once followed&#xD;
the agitated Titman, who had left about ten&#xD;
seconds before, and rushed out of the garden. In&#xD;
the mean time the adventurous Barnard, who&#xD;
had slipped to the rear of the house to procure a&#xD;
pole for the wholesome purpose of keeping order&#xD;
in the unwelcome audience to their proposed&#xD;
concert, was detected by the two serving-men in&#xD;
the act of removing a rail from the barn-yard fence,&#xD;
and was atonce engaged in a sharp contest with&#xD;
these faithful domestics. With one sweep of his&#xD;
impromptu weapon he had knocked one of them&#xD;
into insensibility and a dungheap near by, and had&#xD;
already clenched with the second, when the vigil-&#xD;
ant friend, the retreating basso relieve, leaped the&#xD;
side fence in rescue, followed inespit dai corps by&#xD;
the tenor, just as the excited proprietor of the&#xD;
mansion, who had been somewhat delayed by the&#xD;
frantic embraces of his wife and daughters, tore&#xD;
around the corner in pursuit of Moses. The race&#xD;
between this gentleman and our hero was a short&#xD;
one. Such was the remarkable speed of the lat-&#xD;
ter, urged on by the thought of disgrace in his&#xD;
rear, which had been aroused by a dim idea of&#xD;
Barnard's operations, that he, no doubt, would&#xD;
have overtaken the panic-stricken Titman, and es-&#xD;
caped the excited proprietor, particularly as the&#xD;
latter made the mistake in his confusion of stop-&#xD;
ping to knock up the village doctor. But roost&#xD;
unfortunately, in the course of his flight, Moses&#xD;
came intoabrupt contact with an old lady, who had&#xD;
happened to come outof asick-room,where she was&#xD;
watching, to look up the sti-eet and see what was&#xD;
the matter. The unhappy female was scared into&#xD;
dreadful fits and insensibility, even if she were not&#xD;
so knocked by our hero's physicalmomentum. The&#xD;
candle which she held over her head flew half a&#xD;
dozen feet into the road. Moses stopped to pick&#xD;
it up. All consideration of personal disgrace or&#xD;
danger passed from his mind at the moment, and&#xD;
in his alarmed benevolence he turned to lift the&#xD;
rigid old lady from the ground, when the proprie.&#xD;
tor of the fowls came up. The parley was short.&#xD;
" Scoundrel !" said the proprietor.&#xD;
" Allow me, allow me to explain, Mr. Wil-&#xD;
liams," said our hero hastily. " You will soon&#xD;
see that such ungentlemanly epithets should not&#xD;
be idly-"&#xD;
"My name an't Williams !"&#xD;
"But you know him. He's stopping at your&#xD;
house, from the city."&#xD;
" Ie can't, you d-d rascal, and there's no such&#xD;
person about I You infernal rascal 1 Murder,&#xD;
thieves," said the other. "Good GodI what's&#xD;
this ? Poor old widow Simpson, murdered too !"&#xD;
With these words he made a blow at our hero,&#xD;
and at once attempted to seize him. Moses felt&#xD;
it to be his imperative duty to protect himself as&#xD;
best he could. He administered a successful tap&#xD;
upon the nose of his excited assailant, which&#xD;
seemed to paralyze the latter's intelligence, and&#xD;
then followed that up by punching him power,&#xD;
fullyand rapidly, two or three times, in the abdo-&#xD;
men. He was a stout, able-bodied, country geo-&#xD;
tleman. He stood for a moment gasping for the&#xD;
breath which was thus rudely expelled from his&#xD;
person, and then, slowly wavering, gradually sank&#xD;
upon the ground, which he watered with thec&#xD;
blood from his nose, at a short distance from tihe&#xD;
unfortunate old lady&#xD;
Moses then, in melancholy grandeur, stalked&#xD;

off to the ddpot, where, after some search, he&#xD;
found Mr. Titman secreted behind two barrels in a&#xD;
merchandise shed.  We do not propose , to&#xD;
minutelv recount the ipanner in which Mr. Bar-&#xD;
nard and his friends escaped. We will merely&#xD;
state that they were accustomed to pugilistic en-&#xD;
counters, and that Mr. Barnard in accidentally visit-&#xD;
ing the hospital at Hartford six months after-&#xD;
ward, concluded it to be his duty to leave a con.&#xD;
siderable sum of money for the benefit of a con-&#xD;
valescing patient he saw there. Both he and his&#xD;
friends shortly joined Mr. Winkfield and Titman&#xD;
at the depot in high spirits. A night train was&#xD;
opportunely coming along, and the whole party&#xD;
were seated therein and on their way back, be-&#xD;
fore Mr. Titman had recovered from his palpita-&#xD;
tion, before Moses had time to reflect upon the&#xD;
doubtful termination of the night's adventure, or&#xD;
Mr. Barnard and friends to recollect the banquet&#xD;
which awaited them at the village tavern.&#xD;
The next 'morning's issue of the Rye Gazett&#xD;
contained a terrible and startling account of a&#xD;
general onslaught upon its quiet town by a band&#xD;
of English burglars from the city, seventeen it&#xD;
number, in which Moses had the dubious pleasure&#xD;
of reading that Squire Tompkins and two of hit&#xD;
men, were lying in a dangerous condition from&#xD;
wounds received at the hands of the ruffian des&#xD;
peradoes; that the widow Simpson's house ha&#xD;
been robbed from top to bottom, and the unhapp;&#xD;
proprietor herself frightened to death. The ac&#xD;
count was somewhat exaggerated, no doubt, bu&#xD;
it was enough to keep the aroused community o&#xD;
Rye in an excitement for weeks thereafter.&#xD;

MISS DE POMPENKOPS CONFIDES HER SOCIAL NEED&#xD;

RESULTS IN A VERY IMPULSIVE PROCEEDING UPO&#xD;

MR. ToPLADY had vigorously kept up his siege&#xD;
to Miss De Pompenkops's affections, and by n&#xD;
merous interviews with her, had reason to thin&#xD;
he had materially advanced his positio&#xD;
Though from her characteristic delicacy be sa&#xD;
no prospect of conquest, unaided, he still f&#xD;
that his intimacy with her would now warra&#xD;
the intervention of some common friend. F&#xD;
this purpose he delicately intimated to  h&#xD;
nephew, his desire of securing at some future p&#xD;
riod that of Miss Wagbull. In the mean time&#xD;
mania for secretaries and readers had becor&#xD;
prevalent in fashionable circles, and MissI&#xD;
Pompenkops, under the influence of the diste&#xD;
per, had applied to Miss Wagbull for her advi&#xD;
upon the best method of procuring a reliable or&#xD;
We give the reader the following conversati&#xD;
which took place in Miss De Pompenkops's p&#xD;
lor one afternoon between that lady and Mr. T&#xD;
lady, as a natural consequence of this state of&#xD;
fairs, and as furthermore illustrating the progrc&#xD;
of the latter's suit, which made therein an-&#xD;
vance, undoubtedly unexpected to all parties.&#xD;
" Mr. Toplady, Miss Wagbull and I were c~&#xD;
versing to-day about a matter of interest to m&#xD;
said Miss De P'ompenkops, after a few momen&#xD;
conversation.&#xD;
" Ah I'" said Mr. Toplady, on the qui vi&#xD;
&#xD;
[KFIELD-&#xD;
(" The dear girl! Can she have already smoothed&#xD;
the way for something?")&#xD;
" And she alluded to the fact,'" continued Miss&#xD;
De Pompenkops, hesitating, '"that you, Mr. Top-&#xD;
lady, were especially fitted and would be willing&#xD;
to supply a great social need I have I"&#xD;
" Great heavens " exclaimed Mr. Toplady, with&#xD;
ill-concealed joy. "Yes, yes, my dear Miss De&#xD;
Pompenkops-pardon me if I now thus address&#xD;
you-Miss Wagbull has already been apprised of&#xD;
my-my willingness to supply that want! (Moses&#xD;
must have done it !)"&#xD;
"Then you think you can, without any trouble,&#xD;
fill the situation for me?"&#xD;
"Fill the situation?  Try me, madam!" ex-&#xD;
claimed Mr. Toplady, mad with joy. "Command&#xD;
me at once as your slave, to-to-"&#xD;
"I thank you, Mr. Toplady, for this warm evi-&#xD;
dence of your friendship. In taking into con-&#xD;
sideration your knowledge of your fellow-men,&#xD;
e your experience in judging of character, and,&#xD;
above all your knowledge of Italians and the&#xD;
I Italian language which has been necessary in your&#xD;
business, she thought you were especially adapted&#xD;
e to gratify me."&#xD;
s   " Knowledge of Italians !" exclaimed Mr. Top-&#xD;
1 lady confusedly.&#xD;
-   " Oh! yes. Mamma thinks I'd better have a&#xD;
d person who can read the Italian to me in my&#xD;
y mornmg hours."&#xD;
-   " Ah  she is right! Your respected mother&#xD;
it is quite right !" continued Mr. Toplady approving-&#xD;
of ly. "There will be no difficulty in me upon that,&#xD;
my dear-friend I"&#xD;
" I want a person of good education, of real&#xD;
refinement, Mr. Toplady ; of a tender, respectful&#xD;
regard for the amenities of society, a person pos-&#xD;
sessing a good disposition, one who has a critical&#xD;
taste in poetry, and is religiously disposed."&#xD;
DS  "And in me, dear Miss De Pompenkops," cried&#xD;
1P Mr. Toplady, rising in ardor; "in me, do you&#xD;
N as well as Miss Wagbull see one who can supply,&#xD;
you with all these virtues ?"&#xD;
"I do; and there is one more desideratum,&#xD;
ge Mr. Toplady, which I think I had better mention,&#xD;
u- before you accept my proposition, and that is,&#xD;
k that there will be no objection to sleeping in the&#xD;
n. servants' dormitory, and eating with the butler."&#xD;
w "Sleeping in the dormitory, and eating with&#xD;
elt the butler !" ejaculated Mr..Toplady aghast, and&#xD;
nt pausing in the gallant action he was contem-&#xD;
or plating. "I hope, ma'am, my dear Miss De Pom-&#xD;
is penkops, that you will not, meist upon that.&#xD;
Pe- Never! madam. Never can it be agreed to !"&#xD;
a    "What ! do you think so? Then I will not&#xD;
me think of it. It is perhaps immaterial !" replied&#xD;
De the young lady.&#xD;
m-    "Ah ! you are true to yourself in doing so,"&#xD;
ice said Mr. Toplady with renewed ardor, taking her&#xD;
ne. hand. "And when in the course of events,"&#xD;
on continued he tenderly, looking the young lady&#xD;
ar- in her eyes, "there shall be little prattlers about&#xD;
op- this household, would you, would you have any&#xD;
af- objection to--          ,    .&#xD;

ad- lady, faintly endeavoring to withdraw her hand.&#xD;
" Yes, children." ,&#xD;
o- " Whose children, Mr. Toplady ?" asked the&#xD;
a,"' young lady in astonishment. ..&#xD;
ts' " Why,. ours to be sure ! But I see, I was&#xD;
foolish to mention the subject now, and as your&#xD;
ye. accepted faithful lover and proud husband, let&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
me on my knees, imprint a chaste kiss upon this&#xD;
fair hand," said Mr. Toplady hurriedly, and suit-&#xD;
ing the action to the word. "I live but in your&#xD;
eyes, the touch of your smile thrills my being !"&#xD;
With a short, hysterical shriek, the young&#xD;
lady drew back, gasped for articulated utterance,&#xD;
and then assuming a terrible attitude of dignity,&#xD;
motioned him away from her.&#xD;
"My dear-Miss De Pompenkops, I-"&#xD;
"Don't speak to me, sir I"&#xD;
"But gracious ! I--" .&#xD;
"If you have any sense of decency left, and do&#xD;
not wish me to cause you to be expelled by the&#xD;
servants, you will immediately leave my presence,&#xD;
sir !"&#xD;
"Good heavens! But my dear Miss De Pom-&#xD;
penkops, I meant no offense. I-"&#xD;
"How dare you, sir, have presumed to address&#xD;
me, sir, in the manner you did ?"&#xD;
"As for that, ma'am, my dear Miss De Pom-&#xD;
penkops, was not I warranted by your kind&#xD;
words in-"&#xD;
" Warranted! More insults? But leave me,&#xD;
sir. Leave me !"&#xD;
"(Devil ! what prudery! She is willing to&#xD;
have me as a husband, but is not willing to have&#xD;
me kiss her hand!) If you wish me to, Miss De&#xD;
Pompenkops, I will!"&#xD;
"I do, sir."&#xD;
"Very well, I will then obey your wishes !"&#xD;
"You may go with the assurance that I par-&#xD;
don your presumption, and that I at least shall&#xD;
not think it due to either of us, to mention this&#xD;
scene to any one."&#xD;
" I thank you, madam," replied the exercised&#xD;
and bewildered Toplady. "But mayvI-may I-&#xD;
call again ?"y&#xD;
" Your own judgment must direct you in that,&#xD;
sir," replied the young lady coldly. "If you&#xD;
should think it best, you will, of course, be hon-&#xD;
orable enough to assure me by your conduct that&#xD;
I have been right in leaving it to you."&#xD;
With this terrible speech, the young lady]&#xD;
haughtily withdrew from the room, and the un-&#xD;
fortunate Toplady left her mansion in bewildered&#xD;
dejection. All h's old suspicion and antipathy to&#xD;
the sex came back upon him. " She is a proud,&#xD;
cold girl, or else she is dreadfully delicate, or&#xD;
else she was thinking too much of her money,&#xD;
or else she loves some one else ! That confound-&#xD;
ed Beekman! No, no, it can not be, it's me.&#xD;
She told me so in as many words, by heaven !&#xD;
What does it mean? I wonder if it is always the&#xD;
way with 'em in such cases! I ought to have&#xD;
gone on-I ought to have gone on-and kissed&#xD;
her !"&#xD;
CHAPTER    XXXV.&#xD;
MOSES' GOES ON A DELICATE MiSSION FOR MR.&#xD;
TITMAN, INTO THE GREAT STATE OF NEW-JERSEY.&#xD;
THE proverb that "faint heart ne'er won fair&#xD;
lady," refers ~to the superhuman energy which&#xD;
men are required to exert, when ladies arc of that&#xD;
kind, who can not be easily deluded into the be-&#xD;
lief that the lover is the most perfect of earthly&#xD;
beings, or when their parents or other "surround-&#xD;
log circumstances," render it impossible for&#xD;
them to have any definite estimate of their lover's&#xD;
&#xD;
character at all. Either of these alternatives&#xD;
may have been the case of Mr. Titman, but&#xD;
whether the one or the other was the obstacle&#xD;
he saw before him, Ie did not falter in his pas-&#xD;
sionate ardor. Thus it was but a few days after&#xD;
the unsatisfactory termination of his musical es-&#xD;
say he disclosed to Moses, that he had been oc-&#xD;
cupying his spare moments in reconnoitering the&#xD;
situation of his inamorata and her family, through&#xD;
the means of confidential agents in the shape of&#xD;
small boys and grocery-men, resulting in the in-&#xD;
formation that the young lady's visit to Rye had&#xD;
been already concluded, ere the attempted musi-&#xD;
cal offering, but that she had now permanently&#xD;
departed with the remainder of her family in its&#xD;
annual retreat, to their own country place in&#xD;
the delightful confines of Newark, New-Jersey.&#xD;
From the reports laid before him by his scouts,&#xD;
he had inferred that the severity of the stern&#xD;
parent's care over his daughter's social relations,&#xD;
was undoubtedly chronic in its nature, and that&#xD;
much difficulty might be naturally apprehended&#xD;
from the prosecution of his proposed suit. For&#xD;
this reason he again sought the wise counsel and&#xD;
practical aid of Mr. Winkfield in the matter, and&#xD;
by a mixture of timidity and ardor increasing&#xD;
Moses's sympathy and admiration, at once secured&#xD;
both.&#xD;
"You think that Miss Williams is perfectly&#xD;
assured of the depth of your sentiments toward&#xD;
her ?" inquired Moses with habitual prudence.&#xD;
"Ye-es, yes," replied Mr. Titman, who was&#xD;
well assured of it himself, if she was not.&#xD;
"And you say you were enabled to follow&#xD;
them to Newark?" continued Moses still in inves-&#xD;
tigation.&#xD;
"Yes, and I found out from the parcel ex-&#xD;
pressman, just where they live in Bloomington.&#xD;
The house is as secluded as a convent. I am&#xD;
confident she is cruelly treated. No one there,&#xD;
and she is shut up like a nun."&#xD;
' " I hope not," replied our hero. "But we are&#xD;
authorized to do something, and as it is impossi-&#xD;
ble for you to see her at present without difficulty,&#xD;
the first step seems to be a note from you, asking&#xD;
her permission to continue your friendship with&#xD;
her, to secretly counteract such unjust rigor."&#xD;
" A note ! what is the good of that? It would&#xD;
fall into the hands of her father, who would treat&#xD;
her with more severity than ever !"&#xD;
"No, I will see her personally."&#xD;
"You !" exclaimed Titman, who seemed mo&#xD;
mentarily doubtful whether Moses might not pos-&#xD;
sibly be trying to become principal instead of sec-&#xD;
ond in the matter.&#xD;
" Yes, I will place the note in her hands my-&#xD;
self," continued Moses generously.&#xD;
" But I didn't think of writing to her just yet !"&#xD;
" What! You are serious, are you not ?"&#xD;
asked Moses sternly.&#xD;
"Oh! yes. Yes," exclaimed Mr. Titman, who&#xD;
felt authorized to be positive on this point.&#xD;
"Then you can't begin too soon. No man&#xD;
ever yet successfully wooed a woman without&#xD;
being obliged to spend a great deal of time in&#xD;
writing to her. They demand it. Because it is&#xD;
etiquette, I suppose. And under the circum-&#xD;
stances of her parent's opposition, it is absolute-&#xD;
ly necessary, as a voucher for the sincerity of the&#xD;
future surreptitious and underhanded measures&#xD;
which it is highly probable you will have to&#xD;
take."&#xD;

in the matter.                                "'Deed, I do, massa. All wes cullerd folks&#xD;

" But hadn't you better take Brunswick or some and they drove on. They soon reached the place&#xD;

odd-looking, ancient vehicle, evidently accus- barbarous natives, by the influx of enlightenment&#xD;

taut precinct of the town known to the old in- mately come when its legislature would, no doubt,&#xD;
habitants as Higgins's farm, and to the more re- consent to the great amendments of the Federal&#xD;
cent ones as Bloomington. He enjoyed the ride constitution in favor of those principles. By the&#xD;
through the town very muck, the passing view of time he had arrived at the corner-post, marking&#xD;
the public buildings, and the peculiarly lovely the dominions of Mr. Williams, the first gentle&#xD;
ladies, making their purchases in the various mixture of light -and darkness ruled the scene,&#xD;
stores, and the immense number of indolent ne- and every thing seemed propitious to his debut as5&#xD;
groes, everywhere engaged in the laudable becu- an amateur postman. The house and grounds&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
were situated upon a corner made by the road&#xD;
and a lane, and surrounded by a lofty fence of&#xD;
ornamental pickets. A large number of fruit-&#xD;
trees graced the grounds, and in the middle, a&#xD;
grape arbor suggested the spot, to which the&#xD;
young lady was accustomed to repair, at just&#xD;
such a sentimental hour, to speculate upon the&#xD;
chances of escaping to some watering-place dur-&#xD;
ing the season, or of persuading her father to re-&#xD;
lax his eccentric parental vigilance, in reference&#xD;
to Mr. Titman and such other beaux as she&#xD;
might have. The families of the neighborhood&#xD;
had returned from their drives, and Mr. Williams&#xD;
and his were then probably engaged in the sedate&#xD;
enjoyment of their tea.&#xD;
"I think I can see them at the table in the&#xD;
back-room," said' Moses, looking through the&#xD;
fence and intervening foliage from the secluded&#xD;
lane. " If she comes out into the arbor after tea,&#xD;
it wjll be an easy matter. I can quietly whisper&#xD;
to her, through the fence, from whom I come, and&#xD;
at once hand her the letter."&#xD;
As if to give assurance to his words, a young&#xD;
lady here appeared upon the piazza, accompanied&#xD;
by an elderly one, evidently her mother.&#xD;
" How unlucky ! Extremely ill-timed upon the&#xD;
part of the old lady. She is looking directly this&#xD;
way, too, and may take me for an improper char-&#xD;
acter, if she sees me," thought he, slipping be-&#xD;
hind a tree.&#xD;
Suddenly the old lady sneezed, and took her-&#xD;
self into the house, while her daughter appeared&#xD;
to settle upon the piazza, as if for the purpose of&#xD;
more permanently enjoying the fresh air and'&#xD;
pleasant scene.&#xD;
" Good! Now is my 'time. She is entirely&#xD;
alone. No one at the windows !"&#xD;
He hazarded attracting the attention of other&#xD;
members of the family ; but lie opened a side-&#xD;
gate near him and quietly walked in. Embold-&#xD;
ened by his success, lie took a few paces and&#xD;
gained a heavy box-bush, where lie again paused&#xD;
to reconnoitre. A gentleman emanated from the&#xD;
house, stopped a moment upon the piazza to sniff&#xD;
the fresh air, then descrying a hoe, lying upon&#xD;
the grass within ten feet of Moses's ambush, pro-&#xD;
ceeded to take the instrument, with a i itter, to-&#xD;
ward the stable.&#xD;
" Confound that John I Leaves every thing&#xD;
about. There's that side-gate unlocked, and wide&#xD;
open again for the cows to enter to-night 1"&#xD;
By a vigorous hop, Moses gained an adjoining&#xD;
bush, which he shortly exchanged-while the&#xD;
gentleman was engaged in locking the side-gate,&#xD;
the only facile means of egress-for the entrance&#xD;
of a wood-shed, adjoining the stable. Presently&#xD;
the gentleman approached thi very wood-shed&#xD;
with the hoe in his hand, and Moses fled further&#xD;
into a wash-house, the next in the chain of offices,&#xD;
and adjacent to the kitchen. Here he stood up&#xD;
as close as he could against the wall in a dark&#xD;
corner, with a slight perspiration upon his brow.&#xD;
"John! Here! Come here, John !" cried the&#xD;
gentleman, irritably from the wood-shed.&#xD;
A chair was quickly drawn back from a table&#xD;
in the kitchen at this summons, and a man there-&#xD;
from passed within two feet of Moses to obey it.&#xD;
To add to his growing uneasiness at his position,&#xD;
Moses listened for fifteen minutes subsequently to&#xD;
a terribly dreary exhortation and apology between&#xD;
the master and man at tme entrance of the wood-.&#xD;
shed, upon the subject of the hoe, gate, and other&#xD;
&#xD;
derelictions. It seems as though they never&#xD;
would have done, and had taken root at the door&#xD;
of the wood-house.&#xD;
"This is unfortunate !" reflected Moses. " The&#xD;
hope of succeeding this time appears vain. And&#xD;
gracious! it will be unpleasant to be caught here&#xD;
now    I couldn't explain myself. As soon as&#xD;
they go, if they ever will, I'll quietly regain the&#xD;
yard, and edge round to the front-gate."&#xD;
Circumstances beyond his control immediately&#xD;
rendered this reflection apparently useless. A&#xD;
light was struck in the adjoining kitchen, and fell&#xD;
with particular illuminating power upon the very&#xD;
corner in which he stood, while a noise of chairs&#xD;
being drawn back from the supper-table therein,&#xD;
announced that the domestics had at last appeased&#xD;
the cravings of their appetites. A tall wicker&#xD;
clothes-hamper, half-filled with unwashed linen,&#xD;
stood near our hero. He could not attempt to&#xD;
leave the wash-house under the circumstances,&#xD;
and there was no place of concealment but in&#xD;
this. He therefore grabbed in agitation an arm-&#xD;
ful of clothes therefrom, mounted the adjacent&#xD;
wash-bench, and sliding ignominiously into the&#xD;
basket, at once covered himself with the clothes.&#xD;
That this was a timely measure no one can doubt.&#xD;
The wash-house was a favorite place of evening&#xD;
resort to the domestics. Its brick floor protected&#xD;
them from the damps of the night, and the even-&#xD;
ing wind, blowing through, rendered it especially&#xD;
agreeable to those seeking a safe effect thereof&#xD;
on the warm summer night. The apartment was,&#xD;
almost immediately after Moses's prompt conceal-&#xD;
ment, occupied by the cook and housemaid, who&#xD;
naturally preferred a pleasant rest there to the&#xD;
labor of removing the banquet, and of washing&#xD;
the dishes, which they had left to the scullion.&#xD;
They were presently joined by the returning&#xD;
coachman, and all three proceeded to enjoy them-&#xD;
selves after their manner, in the delights of con-&#xD;
versation and uncouth flirtation, apparently with&#xD;
the intention of prolonging the same for an hour&#xD;
or two at the very least.&#xD;
The house cat, following her habits also, entered&#xD;
likewise, and after a short tour of purring about&#xD;
the various occupants, with a leap proceeded to&#xD;
cosily settle herself in the identical clothes-basket&#xD;
in which our hero was secreted, and directly over&#xD;
his heatd.  What were his sensations in this Fal-&#xD;
staffian retreat?  In the garden, his foolings were&#xD;
alive with adventure. In the wood-shed, hc had&#xD;
bravely scorned the imminent chances of being&#xD;
consigned to a constable. His spirit in the cause&#xD;
of his friend, mounted high in the corner of the&#xD;
wash-house, and here, with an ample opportunity&#xD;
of reflecting upon the rectitude of that cause, it&#xD;
must have mounted still higher; but how lie&#xD;
wished they would goI It was not his moral na-&#xD;
ture which failed him, but his physical.  His&#xD;
cramped position became unendurable, and lie&#xD;
had to move. As lie commenced to  do so, the&#xD;
cat, alarmed from her doze, jumped up hastily,&#xD;
smelt about for a moment, and then with renewed&#xD;
assurance nestled once more in her position. A&#xD;
few moments elapsed. The excruciation of Mo.&#xD;
uses' posture culminated again, and he again was&#xD;
forced to relieve himself. The cat, with swelled&#xD;
tail and back, growled and spit in fright, and&#xD;
dashed maldly to the floor, between the talkative&#xD;
domestics.&#xD;
"Gracious me! What's the matter with the cat?"&#xD;
ctied the housemaid. " Here Jenny, puss, kit, kit I4&#xD;

"I do know! There's a rat or something' inf&#xD;

paused at the evolutions of the animal.I&#xD;
" Do go and see," said the housemaid timidly.&#xD;
" Well, I will," was the answer of the man, A&#xD;
It was all over!1 There was no use in any at-I&#xD;
tempt by Moses to escape. The coachman held&#xD;
him firmly in the basket, until the excited females&#xD;
informed the head of the house, and in a few&#xD;
moments, stoutly secured, he was led into the&#xD;
library to await the arrival of the village con-&#xD;
stable, for whom a boy had been at once hastily&#xD;
dispatched to Bloomington Centre. The particu-&#xD;
lars of the subsequent proceedings in this affair&#xD;
were very disagreeable to our hero, but they&#xD;
must be related. He thought not of endeavoring&#xD;
to avoid a speedy consignment to the county jail&#xD;
upon the dreadful charge of burglary. No, he&#xD;
thought only of avoiding a betrayal of his friend's&#xD;
cause in an explanation. In the grandeur of his&#xD;
spirit, he resolved to say nothing at all about the&#xD;
sacred secret, and as he had little to say about&#xD;
any thing else, to rely for extrication upon a pro-&#xD;
pitious destiny and the chance of covertly appris-&#xD;
ing the young lady of his character as Titman's&#xD;
ambassador. She appeared in the library among&#xD;
the rest. But in vain did he endeavor to attract&#xD;
her notice, by contorting his expressive counten-&#xD;
ance'in silently fashioning the magic name of her&#xD;
lover., The more decided his efforts to make the&#xD;
syllables appear distinct upon his lips, the greater&#xD;
was the mingled astonishment, concern, and risi-&#xD;
bility of all the parties present. His gentlemanly&#xD;
bearing and intellectual features precluded the&#xD;
possibility of his being a professional house-&#xD;
breaker. Linked with his extraordinary grimaces&#xD;
and his remarkable reticence, they led to the&#xD;
very strong theory that he was drunk, and finally&#xD;
to the stronger one that he was insaine.&#xD;
" What did you want in the wash-house, my&#xD;
man ?" inquired the master of the house for the&#xD;
fiftieth time.&#xD;
"Come, speak up, feller, haven't ye got a&#xD;
tongue?" reiterated the constable, while the fe-&#xD;
males kept up the discordant chorus of "The&#xD;
dreadful creature!  Poor young man! How I&#xD;
pity him! How wild he looks !" etc., etc.&#xD;
" TitmanI Mr. Titman! Miss Williams, can&#xD;
I have a few moments' conversation with you?"&#xD;
at last said the prisoner audibly to the young&#xD;
lady, unable to endure his pantomimic exercise&#xD;
any longer.&#xD;
"With me ?" ejaculated the young ladyin fear.&#xD;
"Why, what does he wish, papa? He speaks&#xD;
of a Mr. Titman. Who is Mr. Titman, papa?"&#xD;
"What!" roared Moses excitedly. "Do you,&#xD;
mean to say, Miss,. that you have not lately be-&#xD;
come acquainted, in New-York, with a young&#xD;
gentleman of small stature, who has expressed a&#xD;
decided preference for your society, and-"&#xD;
"I assure you, papa, I know no such person !"&#xD;
replied the young lady with a mixture of incre-&#xD;
dulity and curiosity.&#xD;
" Then you do not lfhow this handwriting!"&#xD;
continued Moses dildly, and succeeding in show-&#xD;
ing a corner of the note in his vest-pocket.&#xD;
The note was extracted.  It was a copy of&#xD;
Byron's poem to Mary, and signed " Theodore&#xD;
the stranger." The contents were a proof to&#xD;
Moses, that he had been gros-hy deceived by Tit-&#xD;
man upon the degree of time latter's intimacy&#xD;
with the young lady, for that gentleman was con-&#xD;
&#xD;
fessing in the very signature, perhaps, that he&#xD;
was a stranger to her. To the constable, they&#xD;
were a proof that he was an adroit housebreaker,&#xD;
with a deliberated plan. To the rest, that he was&#xD;
crazy with disappointed love. A final consulta-&#xD;
tion was held, to assist in which a neighbor was&#xD;
called in, a member of the Jersey legislature,&#xD;
who suggested that our hero should be carried to&#xD;
the " New-Jersey State Asylum for Idiots and In-&#xD;
sane Persons," as it was felicitously situated but&#xD;
three miles therefrom, on the road to Paterson.&#xD;
And a most humane suggestion it was, too, for&#xD;
the gentleman himself, in company with many of&#xD;
the body to which he belonged had been there,&#xD;
and from personal experience of the treatment,&#xD;
knew it to be a very pleasant and mildly con-&#xD;
ducted institution. A compromise was at last&#xD;
made with the constable, who had proposed&#xD;
carrying him to the Newark jail, and by and&#xD;
with that functionary's agency and consent, our&#xD;
hero was carried for the night to the asylum, in&#xD;
the family carriage of Mr. Williams, with the&#xD;
prospect of a medical examination in the morn-&#xD;
ing, and, no doubt, a judicial one speedily there.&#xD;
after.&#xD;
He escaped from this institution, upon the&#xD;
morning of the second day of his incarceration,&#xD;
by knocking down the doctor and two of the&#xD;
keepers, and tearing energetically out of the back-&#xD;
gate. He arrived safely in New-York, but with&#xD;
what feelings ? His confidence in Titman was,&#xD;
we may say, entirely gone. He sought that dere-&#xD;
lict party, with the vague intention of seeking&#xD;
compensation for the suffering he had undergone,&#xD;
in his delusive cause, by personal satisfaction.&#xD;
Ip particular did he dwell in his vehement up-&#xD;
braiding, upon the powerful dose of jalap and&#xD;
the fourteen showe'-baths to which they had&#xD;
subjected him in his short stay in the asylum.&#xD;
The penitent Titman made a hasty confession of&#xD;
the true state of his relations with the young lady,&#xD;
which consisted simply, in his having picked up a&#xD;
handkerchief dropped by the young lady in the&#xD;
street, of having been eccentrically tendered fifty&#xD;
cents as a reward therefor by her mother accom-&#xD;
panying her, and of his infatuatedly watchig&#xD;
their progress home, and subsequent movements&#xD;
to Rye and other places.&#xD;
"And were you introduced to them by your&#xD;
friend the Boston painter ?" asked his inquisitor&#xD;
sternly.&#xD;
"No, no. He said he knew them, but be had&#xD;
to go away !" replied Mr. Titman in utter con-&#xD;
fusion.&#xD;
"And you never went to her house at all!"&#xD;
continued the inquisitor.&#xD;
" Ye-es. Yes. I went with his card. But&#xD;
I saw only Mr. Williams in the hall, and he was&#xD;
so savage at me, I had to tell him I was looking&#xD;
for some one else, and I came away. I couldn't&#xD;
stand him !"&#xD;
" And you did not mutually plight your troth&#xD;
in the entry ?"&#xD;
"N-o-o! No!"&#xD;
"Titman !" said Moses, passing sentence. "I&#xD;
consider you an impostor and a dangerous person&#xD;
to be about in society ! My reliance upon your&#xD;
stability of character, at least in such matters as&#xD;
these, is gone altogether. But for your sake and&#xD;
in consideration of my friendship for you, I con-&#xD;
sent not to divulge this matter to any one."&#xD;
" Thank you !" said the relieved Titman.&#xD;
&#xD;
"And    I expect you will not," concluded&#xD;
Moses.&#xD;

AND HIS AMOUR.&#xD;
ON the morning of Mr Winkfield's Jersey excur-&#xD;
sion, Brunswick determined to devote his leisure&#xD;
to the discharge of a dutiful visit to his step.&#xD;
mother, and for that purpose at once repaired to&#xD;
her home in Summer Lane. It was a fine day,&#xD;
the air was balmy and the scene delightful there.&#xD;
Her house was a wooden one, situated in the rear&#xD;
of a large brick manufactory, with a little yard at&#xD;
the side and rear.  Hollyhock bushes were grow.&#xD;
iig therein, and morning-glory vines climbed over&#xD;
the mansion and over a neatly white-washed hen-&#xD;
house near by, about which numerous fowls were&#xD;
stalking, or resting in the sand and shade. An&#xD;
ironing table with its utensils, removed from the&#xD;
house on account of the warm weather, was&#xD;
placed upon the brick pavement. At one of its&#xD;
ends was a plate of water-melon, handy to which&#xD;
and reclining upon a wooden bench, was a rather&#xD;
long colored young gentleman, with his wool&#xD;
done in pyramidal form on his head, an extreme-&#xD;
ly peaked nose and a very bright eye. 'He ap-&#xD;
peared to be dividing his attention between indo-&#xD;
lently feeling for the pieces of water-melon and&#xD;
ia smiling artfully upon a stout and comely col-&#xD;
ored damsel, engaged in the ironing. Brunswick&#xD;
walked in. The recumbent gentleman sat up&#xD;
and uttered a salutation, cavalierly acknowledg-&#xD;
ing which, Brunswick fell to partaking of the&#xD;
water-melon so largely, that much alarm appeared&#xD;
on the countenance of the other gentleman.&#xD;
"Well, and how's Mr. Winkfield ?" asked Mrs.&#xD;
,hfs-ults&#xD;
"He's well!V' replied Brunswick sulkily, "and&#xD;
so is Mr. Toplady, and Mr. Titman, and Misses&#xD;
Wagbull, and all the folks I know !"&#xD;
Ah! Miss Wagbull! They live in a fine&#xD;
louse, Mr. Difficults. Noble merchant and a&#xD;
num of great attainment," said Mr. Jinks Lom-&#xD;
minydew, "a man of great attainment !"&#xD;
Yes," replied Brunswick.&#xD;
And I understand his daughter is a lady of&#xD;
superior loveliness and tact," continued Mr. Lon-&#xD;
medew. &#xD;
"She dresses beautiful. The last time I see&#xD;
her, she had onto her a rich brokid, cut bias, f&#xD;
You know, with three basque ends at the back, ,&#xD;
insertion laid on straight, fluted spaces run acrosst, f&#xD;
aud frilled skirts, full width!" said the step. t&#xD;
mother, turning to Mr. Lommeydew.   .&#xD;
Tie divinity student appeared to be fully con- f&#xD;
versant in such matters, and presently the con- i&#xD;
Scious glance of the sublime mysteries he shared&#xD;
with her and the rest of the sex, melted into one t&#xD;
Of loveBrunswick said nothing, and after av&#xD;
oinment's silence, made a cheerful effort.  t&#xD;
"Well, I thought I'd come     around and t&#xD;
ins how you're all getting on. Hflow's Shiloh,&#xD;
jinks V&#xD;
"All 9! whly do you stay away, my dear Diffi-&#xD;
-uts Why not walk in our paths, so many&#xD;
iters to guide you with their love and friend-&#xD;
-hp1                                      f&#xD;
&#xD;
"I don't think much onto religion conducted&#xD;
on them principles !" replied Brunswick shortly.&#xD;
"I am fearful that you care for social piety on&#xD;
no principles," said Mr. Lommeydew severely, for&#xD;
the purpose of impressing Mrs. Difficults. "We&#xD;
are skeered of your morril and ethical condition,&#xD;
and truly, Mr. Brunswick, let me warn you.&#xD;
Oh! come and suck in the spirit of truth and&#xD;
holiness from Shiloh's sacred desk."&#xD;
"I don't want to do no suckin-in," said Bruns-&#xD;
wick. " There's'enough humbug and suckin-in&#xD;
already in that ere church !"&#xD;
" Ah ! I was once regardless as you," continued&#xD;
the divinity student, alternately rolling his eyes&#xD;
from Brunswick to the lady. " I was once deep-&#xD;
ly atrocious as you. Like you, I did not notice&#xD;
my double-dyed villainy, my buffoon avarice, my&#xD;
boot-black profanity, my ethical and morril im-&#xD;
morality in eating and drinking-"&#xD;
Here Brunswick interrupted the student by in-&#xD;
forming him that he had such a cheerful confi-&#xD;
dence in his own physical powers, he thought he&#xD;
might be able to pitch him over the hen-house,&#xD;
and pleasantly offered to do it for the small sum&#xD;
of twenty mills or two cents, federal currency.&#xD;
"I meant no offense. I meant no offense,"&#xD;
said the divinity student somewhat hastily. "And&#xD;
I disclaim contention at the moment !"&#xD;
"Look here! I don't want'no words with you !&#xD;
No words at all!" replied Brunswick snorting.&#xD;
" I know you well enough, Jinks. I know'd you&#xD;
ever since you stole Mr. Harper's case of can&#xD;
oysters, when you was a boy, and cat yourseY&#xD;
into a bilious fever, and was found out I"&#xD;
"I pity you, as entirely witless and with lovi&#xD;
attempts at facetiousness !" replied the divinity&#xD;
student slightly touched.&#xD;
Brunswick immediately resumed his handsome&#xD;
offer at this, and his step-mother concluded that&#xD;
she had better interfere. After some further&#xD;
wrangling Brunswick filially consented to a tem-&#xD;
porary reconciliation for the sake of her feelings&#xD;
and rose to leave.&#xD;
"Oh! no. Stay to dinner, Brunswick," said&#xD;
the good-hearted woman. " I am sorry to see&#xD;
you so witless and melancholy-like, and I want&#xD;
you to become cheerful. Do!"&#xD;
Brunswick remained, occupied himself for&#xD;
some time in walking about the garden, examin-&#xD;
ing the hen-house and finally went up-stairs to&#xD;
enjoy a short slumber before dinner. As he&#xD;
passed through the parlor, he observed, hanging&#xD;
there, the much prized coroner's certificate of the&#xD;
disappearance of his father, which only added&#xD;
fuel to his desire to avenge that worthy parent.&#xD;
Instead of sleeping, he looked out of the window&#xD;
furtively, but to see a little love-passage going on&#xD;
below between his step-mother and her swain.&#xD;
The latter was pretending to know how to iron&#xD;
for her, and there was some little tender scuffling&#xD;
n the contest for the smoothing-iron. As the&#xD;
whole moral trouble of Brunswick would have&#xD;
been obviated by the extermination of the di-&#xD;
vinity student, and as he felt there was no par-&#xD;
icular harm in committing murder in inagina-&#xD;
ionghe now did so upon the obnoxious party in&#xD;
various ways, such as'by putting poison in water-&#xD;
meons, by making him read the congressional&#xD;
eposts, by dosing him with Conway's Consump&#xD;
ive cure, by inducing him to take 'a walk down&#xD;
Jacob street or a trip on a Jersey railroad, and&#xD;
mnally, observing'- a ten pound weigh t in tho&#xD;

&#xD;
corner of his bed-room, among other business&#xD;
relics of his respected parent, he adjusted it with&#xD;
nice poiseover the vital part of the student re-&#xD;
cliningbelow, and speculated upon the pleasing&#xD;
consequences of permitting it to fall upon him.&#xD;
An half-hour was to intervene between the&#xD;
cessation of the ironing and the commencement&#xD;
of the process of getting dinner by the lady, and&#xD;
the prospect of the repast moved the divinity&#xD;
student again from his recumbent position. The&#xD;
language of the two lovers thus left together&#xD;
was different from the ordinary speech of unim-&#xD;
passioned  mortality. They lived in another&#xD;
world. All nature was propitious. Around the&#xD;
shaded windows above the bench the morning-&#xD;
glories twined with the jasmine and the running&#xD;
rose. The rose was loaded with flowerets, and&#xD;
the darling morning-glories in sweet accord with&#xD;
the soft tranquillity of the scene lazily closed&#xD;
their tender cups over their delicate petals.&#xD;
Hushed was the scene. The gnats had retired&#xD;
to their coverts from their late incessant dance&#xD;
in the sun, and the stalwart chanticleer was re-&#xD;
clining, in the shade with wings outstretched.&#xD;
while the loved members of his seraglio nestled&#xD;
in the sand about him, or ever and anon pecked&#xD;
softly at various points of their persons. 'Twas&#xD;
noonday in the heated city 'twas noonday in the&#xD;
cool retreat! To persons of the lovers' race&#xD;
'twas better than the twilight hour for the holy&#xD;
communion of feeling.&#xD;
"IAh ! Brunswick sleeps !" said the impassion.&#xD;
ed student, as a gentle noise of one sleeping&#xD;
was wafted to their ears from above.&#xD;
"Yes, yes," replied the lady tenderly, and&#xD;
-sitting down on the bench as she adjusted the lagt&#xD;
fold of the snowy linen upon the rude but useful&#xD;
ironing-table.  The student bent his legs be&#xD;
-neath the bench.&#xD;
"In dim sluggishness, he sleeps with tranquil&#xD;
heart. 'Tis nice, and yet his is not such joy aE&#xD;
ours, dearest !" continued the suitor.&#xD;
"4No, it an't !" replied the lady.&#xD;
"Ah ! I knew one from my earliest childhood&#xD;
amid my infant sports and difficulties of youth&#xD;
if not really, yet in my visions; and now may i&#xD;
not be the hope of a glorious manhood that she&#xD;
that bright apparition, may henceforth be m,&#xD;
prop and stay ? Amid joy and woe, rain and sun&#xD;
shine, may it not ever be thug, 0 dearest ?"&#xD;
He took her unreluctant hand in his, and hi&#xD;
gaze followed hers, to linger with unutterabi&#xD;
thought upon the distant hen-house. The ba&#xD;
ance between the probable cost of being  h&#xD;
prop and stay and the annual yield from tli&#xD;
home of the feathered  tribe, with other specie&#xD;
of the domestic revenue, may have been passing&#xD;
through her mind,and induced her to have r&#xD;
plied merely, "1Dearest sweet P"&#xD;
"Again she evades my oft-repeated question&#xD;
Great heaven ! does every breath influence her&#xD;
Does every weakness move ?" said the love&#xD;
kicking up the gravel in his impatience..&#xD;
"lHist ! Hist 1" said the lady, as the stalwa&#xD;
chanticleer cried out a startled alarm at the d&#xD;
m onstration.&#xD;
"What ?"1&#xD;
"The sleeper stirs. He will wake."&#xD;
"N.Silh    es.  YeadI wretdh&#xD;
would woo in vain my downy couch,1p 1ould&#xD;
"r iWhat, saod whretched, so suddenktly 1 Yo&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
my Emerson? No no ! It may not I" replied the&#xD;
lady, who was apt im these scenes to catch&#xD;
something of her lover's impassioned manner.&#xD;
Such is the power of love. "Ah ! I faint. What&#xD;
meanest ?".&#xD;
" Pardon, love,,my hasty words. I knew not&#xD;
what I said, I-"&#xD;
"10 Emerson I have confidence into me. For&#xD;
to share your grief I would die ."&#xD;
The divinity student covered his face convul-&#xD;
sively with his hands. ,,I&#xD;
'I can not speak it !" he cried hoarsely.&#xD;
"Let me divine! This agitation !Speak ."&#xD;
'Tis well. 'Tis well. Soon called to Jersey&#xD;
as missionary, I-"&#xD;
"Don't, don't! You wrench me !" replied the,&#xD;
lady in her 'alarmed passion. "What! would&#xD;
you leave me?&#xD;
"And why not ?" he replied still hoarsely,&#xD;
"Any thing, every thing. Let destiny fill my&#xD;
lot!  I willnot survive the loss ."&#xD;
"1What loss? What have you lost? Any&#xD;
thing valuable ?" cried the lady in sudden alarm.&#xD;
" Valu'ble ? Yes'm. Your love! You love&#xD;
me not. False one, have I suffered such misery&#xD;
to grow into my heart only to find that I was de-&#xD;
ceived ! That the woman for whom I could have&#xD;
chained that heart's blood could not withstand&#xD;
the frown of an irritated step-son and friends for&#xD;
my sake! Sink him I" cried he in his passion,&#xD;
as he made a convulsive leap into the air. The&#xD;
startled chanticleer fled to the bottom of the&#xD;
yard. All was soon silent again.  The lover&#xD;
stood erect, with arms folded on- his breast in&#xD;
gloomy silence by her side-for one moment,&#xD;
nis face all worn and haggard, his dress disor-&#xD;
I dered, paler than the lady, who with" a faint&#xD;
- smile, -raising herself still more, held out her&#xD;
hand to him.&#xD;
l Gracious heaven ! he had tutored himself to&#xD;
s calmness, but this quite unmanned him.&#xD;
Springing forward he fell on his knees by her&#xD;
side, sobbing her name.&#xD;
,   She bent over him, with tears fast falling on&#xD;
h bia bowed head. Her fair hanal was on his shoul-&#xD;
t der, and he threw his arms around her, speech-&#xD;
, less with great sorrow.&#xD;
y    About three minutes elapsed.&#xD;
 "Emerson I" she said at last, gasping, but still&#xD;
softly. ."It is so decreed, dearest. Be patience,&#xD;
so be patience. There is no shadow between wn&#xD;

her eagerly. She seemed a pitying goddess, all&#xD;

ful arm curled around her. She looked a little&#xD;
scared, but not much. He kissed.her sweet cheek.&#xD;
The blush spread to her very forehead at that,&#xD;
but no resistance. As the winged and rapid&#xD;
bird, if her feathers be but touched with a speck&#xD;
of bird-lime, loses all power of flight, so it seem-&#xD;
ed as if that kiss paralyzed her eel-like and eva-&#xD;
sive powers. Under it her whole supple frame&#xD;
seemed to yield as Emerson drew her closer and&#xD;
closer to him, till she bid her forehead and wet&#xD;
eyelashes on his shoulder and murmured "How&#xD;
could I let you be unhappiness ?"&#xD;
Neither spoke for a while. Each felt for theI&#xD;
other, and Emerson drank that ecstasy of silent&#xD;
delirious bliss which comes to great hearts about&#xD;
half-past eleven in the morning, if the dinner is&#xD;
at twelve.&#xD;
The banquet soon waited the descent of .the&#xD;
gloomy Brunswick. The student said grace with&#xD;
his fork quivering nervoiflsly in the air. They&#xD;
ate. After dinner, Brunswick entered into a&#xD;
game of seven-up with the divinity student, and&#xD;
having abused him for about half an hour in con-&#xD;
sequence of the double exasperation, -of the am-&#xD;
bitious attempt of that worthy to become his&#xD;
father and of an unsuccessful one of cheating at&#xD;
the game, he left for the ferry to await his mas-&#xD;
ter's return from abroad.&#xD;
 CHAPTER   XXXVII.&#xD;
MOSES GOES THROUGH ONE FIRE, WHICH PLEASES&#xD;
HIM TO SUcH AN EXTENT THAT HE IMMEDIATE-&#xD;
LY ATTENDS ANOTHER. A MEMBER OF THE NEW-&#xD;
YORK FIRE DEPARTMENT.&#xD;
SHonTLY after his return from New-Jersey, and&#xD;
in the course of a morning ramble Moses came&#xD;
across a glass globe in a bird shop, containing&#xD;
one large and short-tailed gold fish and three&#xD;
smaller ones, apparently infants of the first, as&#xD;
they too seemed gifted with brief latter ends,&#xD;
and possessed a similar facetious disposition. He&#xD;
took the globe to his home, and called Bruns-&#xD;
wick.&#xD;
"Bruhswick, take these fishes to Miss Wagbull.&#xD;
I will wait until you return."&#xD;
"1Yes, sir," said the servant, starting at once.&#xD;
- "And, Brunswick, you had better see Miss&#xD;
Wagbull yourself."&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"And you 'nayobserve, Brunswick, if she is.&#xD;
pleased with them." -&#xD;
"I will sir."&#xD;
"And Brunswick! Tell her that I thought she&#xD;
would like them, as-as I really fancied them&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
"IYes sir."&#xD;
"And, wait, Brunswick! On the whole, you&#xD;
needn't say any thing about it. Merely present&#xD;
them to her respectfully."&#xD;
"Very well, sir."&#xD;
" By the way, Brunswick! you may observe if&#xD;
she smiles, or if she is-is agitated in any way.'?&#xD;
"I will, sartain, sir !"&#xD;
"Brunswick ! one moment.   have confidence&#xD;
in yo, in thi  t,  -h "&#xD;
" Oh I in minutest- particulars, sir." i&#xD;
i"Then you may go," said our hero, apparently&#xD;
&#xD;
Brunswick returned shortly, and made his re-&#xD;
port.  "I presented the globe of fry to Miss&#xD;
Wagbull, sir, in her front-parlor, and they both&#xD;
said it was a tasteful selection, or similar words."&#xD;
" Both ? Was there any one else there, Bruns-&#xD;
wick ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir; a young gentleman as had drop.&#xD;
ped in on a morning call, with a bouquet. She&#xD;
held it to the big fish to smel of, but with great&#xD;
care, with great care, sir '"&#xD;
" What was the gentleman's name, Bruns-&#xD;
wick ?"g&#xD;
"Horrit, or Horrid, sir."&#xD;
Moses said no more, but presently rose and&#xD;
retiring to the inner room for a few moments,&#xD;
philosophically threw about his hair-brush and&#xD;
pin-cusQhion to relieve some irrepressible feelings&#xD;
which hadnseized him. Toward afternoon, hap.&#xD;
opening accidentally in the neighborhood of Miss&#xD;
Waghull's house hie dropped in.&#xD;
Bessie thanked him heartily for the fishes.&#xD;
"Flora,-too, has favored me this morning," said&#xD;
sie. " See, Mr. Winkfield. Is not this a beautiful&#xD;
camellia?  Mr. Hoyt, who brought it, is very fond&#xD;
of flowers."&#xD;
" It certainly is very beautiful!" replied Moses,&#xD;
inspecting the gorgeous flower.&#xD;
"See those dear little fishes. Mr. Hoyt says&#xD;
there has been lately a great difficulty experienced&#xD;
in cultivating the camellia."&#xD;
I have never seen one more perfect," continued&#xD;
Moses, with philosophic calm.&#xD;
"Yes, Mr. Hoyt said it took him over an hour&#xD;
to make a selection at Bird's."&#xD;
"What a tender, subdued tint," continued&#xD;
Moses, feigning enthusiasm.&#xD;
"Yes, and Mr. Hoyt says that not one in a&#xD;
-thousand are able to attain that peculiar color."&#xD;
S Quite true. It is exceedingly rare. I must&#xD;
say it is exceedingly rare," continued Moses, with&#xD;
soe symptoms o backsliding. (" I wish Hoyt&#xD;
would make his visits here 50o!")&#xD;
"Mr. Hoyt, you know," said Bgio, is --&#xD;
"Certainly!" said Moses rather explosively.&#xD;
"Y ou are quite right in relying upon his taste.&#xD;
Ofcourse. Mr. Hoyt, Miss Wagbull, is a gentle-&#xD;
man of culture and refinement-(whom I have a&#xD;
strong desire to run through with a small-sword!")&#xD;
There had been tdring the conversation a cer.&#xD;
tam species of agitation in the young lady's tone.&#xD;
She did not seem aware that her remarks might&#xD;
be considered quite ordinary and at this point,&#xD;
though she continued them, she seemed struggling&#xD;
with her conscience about what she was doing.&#xD;
There was a young lady of Boston, with whom&#xD;
Miss Wagbul had preserved the constancy of&#xD;
friendship since leaving school, by the interchange&#xD;
of frequent letters and occasional visits. Of this&#xD;
young female mentor she was accustomed to seek&#xD;
for advice upon her wardrobe and other matters&#xD;
of feminine solicitude. Upon that of her admirers,&#xD;
she was wont to delicately elicit this advice through&#xD;
the circumlocution of philosophical and wire-wo-&#xD;
ven estimates of poetical or historical characters,&#xD;
whom she conceived to resemble them, with ro-&#xD;
mantic hypotheses of the influence of these beings&#xD;
uponher own character under varied circum-&#xD;
stances, and receiving emendations of the same&#xD;
by return post. After she became acquainted with&#xD;
Moses, Aristotle appeared in the letters, who soon&#xD;
gave place to Demosthenes, and he to the Prine&#xD;
of Conio, who in turn resigned in favor of Cyriac&#xD;

&#xD;
wine he had ever tasted.   Then there were&#xD;
others, suffering from-a reiiction of their enthu-&#xD;
siasm, and who took a gloomy view of life in&#xD;
general, and were disposed to believe that the&#xD;
doctor was an infernal scoundrel and humbug.&#xD;
There was the German gentleman who had been&#xD;
in the original establishment of Preissnitz, and&#xD;
could tell you all about it, and insisted upon doing&#xD;
it daily. There was a semi-divorced couple who&#xD;
had been separated from each other a half-dozen&#xD;
times from "nincompoopability of temper,!' as the&#xD;
Irish porter of the establishment expressed it,&#xD;
and who were now endeavoring to live under the&#xD;
same roof again; the one with rooms in the ex-&#xD;
tremeiiorth end, and the other considering a&#xD;
southern exposure highly necessary. There were&#xD;
several maiden ladies, permanent, residents, and&#xD;
a Jew who, at the period we speak of, was the&#xD;
cynosure and hero of the establishment, from&#xD;
the remarkable effect which the treatment was&#xD;
having upon   his person.  Ill-treated nature&#xD;
had taken this first opportunity, upon the re-&#xD;
moval of twenty-five years of dirt from the ex-&#xD;
terior of her Israelitish temple, to renovate the&#xD;
interior also. At the time we speak of, the un-&#xD;
fortunate Hebrew had three hundred and twenty&#xD;
boils upon his person, and what little vitality was&#xD;
left in the unfortunate man was kept there by&#xD;
his simple hope that several eminent proprietors&#xD;
of second-hand clothing-stores with whom  he&#xD;
was acquainted would " write books!"&#xD;
Mr. Toplady lived rather retired, here as else-&#xD;
where. He took matutinal and evening bath&#xD;
and walks, read the papers and books during the&#xD;
day, and by whist and conversation with the&#xD;
ladies, managed to fill up the rest of his unoc-&#xD;
cupied hours. At the other end of the village,&#xD;
upon a goodly but somewhat' sequestered site;&#xD;
stood the Unitarian and principal house of wor-&#xD;
ship, to the rear of which was attached, the rec-&#xD;
tory. The church tower commanded a fne view,&#xD;
so one evening after tea, Mr. Toplady strolled&#xD;
thither, with innocence and meditation joined in&#xD;
soft assemblage in his mind, opened the church&#xD;
door and mounted to the belfry, to observe the&#xD;
prospect. By a coincidence, Mrs. Elwell, semi-&#xD;
divorced wife, had come there with the same in-&#xD;
tentions, together with the additional one of be-&#xD;
ing out of sight and hearing of her incompatible&#xD;
husband, and Mr. Toplady found her in that lofty&#xD;
and retired place.&#xD;
" Ah! quite a steeple-chase I've had, madam, '&#xD;
said he gallantly. " But I really didn't expect&#xD;
to find such a belle here. He! he I an agreeable&#xD;
surprise, indeed V"&#xD;
"Yes, sir!" replied the lady, recognizing tht&#xD;
courtesy, and endeavoring to out-do the masterly&#xD;
wit of the effort. "But though one may hav(&#xD;
lofty ideas here, Mr. Toplady, I am sure it was no&#xD;
necessary for you to come here to procure them.'&#xD;
" With such intoxicating flattery frbm youi&#xD;
lips, madam, I'm afraid that I should not requir&#xD;
)the altitude of my present position to get high&#xD;
he ! he !" ,continued Mr. Toplady promptly, an&#xD;
being pleased with his own brilliancy, immediately&#xD;
thought Mrs. Elwell a very charming woman.&#xD;
" A splendid sunset, Mr. Toplady. Look&#xD;
Look at that beautiful Magenta cloud on th&#xD;
right, just above the hill! "&#xD;
" Yes,&#xD;
*At summer eve, when heaven's aerial how -&#xD;
Spans with wie arch the glittering hills below,&#xD;
&#xD;
Why to yon mountain turn themuing eye,&#xD;
Whose sun-bright summit glitters in the sky,&#xD;
Why do those cliffs of shadowy tint appear f&#xD;
More sweet than all the smiling landscape near?'"&#xD;
asked Mr. Toplady, in poetical solemnity, though&#xD;
there were no cliffs and no bow to make the&#xD;
quotations exactly appropriate and the smiling&#xD;
landscape was chiefly represented by a man in&#xD;
an adjacent field milking a cow and grinning ex-&#xD;
pressively at the prospect of the close of his labors&#xD;
for the day.&#xD;
" Those are beautiful lines, Mr.'Toplady," re-&#xD;
plied the lady. "And I like them very much."&#xD;
"Thank you," said Mr. Toplady, receivmg the&#xD;
remark as a personal favor. "Campbell is my&#xD;
favorite poet. I am now enjoying, with unusual&#xD;
interest, the Pleasures of Hope."&#xD;
Here they both occupied themselves with the&#xD;
sunset, and made the usual patronizing remarks&#xD;
about it, as though it were the work of quite a&#xD;
meritorious artist. Then they looked in the east&#xD;
to see how the brush had been thrown there.&#xD;
Then their attention was attracted to the man,&#xD;
milking the cow in the field within view and to&#xD;
,his occasioned expostulations of "So, ye bitch1"&#xD;
and "Dod rot ye !" addressed to the restive animal.&#xD;
And then they were called upon to observe two&#xD;
horses curveting playfully in a pasture further&#xD;
on, and Mr. Toplady spieda roost, with a dozen&#xD;
hens pushing each other and settling upon it,&#xD;
while the noble chanticleer, seatedin the centre,&#xD;
crowed another adieu to kind friends for -the&#xD;
night, or pecked his next neighbors, to reduce&#xD;
them to a proper state of obedient quiet. At&#xD;
last, proposing to leave, Mr. Toplady carefully&#xD;
handed the lady down. To their astonishment,&#xD;
they found the church-door by which they had&#xD;
entered closed and locked. In vain did Mr. Top-&#xD;
lady endeavor to open it, or the remaining one&#xD;
upon the other side of the vestibule. For at least&#xD;
twenty minutes, he futilely expended his efforts&#xD;
in attempting to force back the bolts with his&#xD;
pen-knife, to unscrew the lock, or to remove its&#xD;
fastening by violent application of muscular pow-&#xD;
er. He then entered the body of the church for&#xD;
the purpose of endeavoring to effect a deliverance&#xD;
by means of one of the windows.&#xD;
"Of course I can easily get out in that way,"&#xD;
said he.&#xD;
A practical examination, however, revealed the&#xD;
disagreeable fact, that he was scarcely able, even&#xD;
by standing upon the pews, to reach the bottom&#xD;
t of the window, and had he been -able to lift the&#xD;
e Gothic sash, as there was a dreadfully high base-&#xD;
ment beneath, he would not have felt like precip-&#xD;
e itating himself therefrom, without having pre-&#xD;
y viously made his will, which at that time would&#xD;
e have taken too much time.&#xD;
t   "0 dear! how gloomy it is here, Mr. Toplady!&#xD;
I feel-really afraid. It is so dark !" said 'the&#xD;
r lady timidly, after this failure.&#xD;
e    "Good gracious !" said Mr. Toplady, beginning&#xD;
, to perspire.  "But suppose I accompany you&#xD;
d back to the cupola, as it is still light there ? It&#xD;
y will be more agreeable to you."      .&#xD;
The lady timidly accepted the proposition, but&#xD;
upon reaching the belfry, was immediately driven&#xD;
e back with renewed agitation by the bats.&#xD;
" How stupid of these people ! I suppose soit'&#xD;
of them have locked the door for the night, with-&#xD;

&#xD;
whom   he had reached.    "Secrete yourself !&#xD;
Let us secrete ourselves -in the belfry, and per-&#xD;
haps they will not find us. 0 dear, it is too late&#xD;
to attempt to confront any one now !"&#xD;
Mr. Toplady was quite correct. In a moment&#xD;
or so, the clergyman with a light, his man with a&#xD;
pitch-fork, and his two -servant girls with fire-&#xD;
shovel and/ tongs, came rapidly into the church.&#xD;
"The sermons, goblets and Bible are safe!&#xD;
They've escaped, but without their booty," said&#xD;
the clergyman hastily examining the, pulpit.&#xD;
The man ran to the front-door, and found it as&#xD;
he had left it, locked.&#xD;
"They are somewheres here now, by golly !"&#xD;
said he. "They must have come in here and hid&#xD;
till I locked it, and they haven't got out. The&#xD;
door's jest as I left it !" '&#xD;
"Ring the bell 1 Ring the bell then, Orrin !"&#xD;
cried the clergyman. "We must have aid I"&#xD;
The bell pealed out upon the 'air, and the&#xD;
neighbors obeyed its summons, including many&#xD;
members of the principal fire-company of the vil-&#xD;
lage with axes, an old gentleman and his wife&#xD;
carrying a ladder, and the husband of the unfor-&#xD;
tunate lady in the church, with twenty-three inva-&#xD;
lids from the water-cure, bearing the leathern&#xD;
'buckets of that institution.&#xD;
"Where is it ?" and "What is it?" were the&#xD;
various cries as the crowd tore into the church.&#xD;
The clergyman at once dissipated the prevailing&#xD;
impression, and amid increased excitement, a&#xD;
special search was instituted. The lady was ar-&#xD;
rested behind the belfry door in the gallery, and&#xD;
led below, but Mr. Toplady was gone. To her&#xD;
excited lord and the astonished crowd, she at&#xD;
once endeavored to explain her extraordinary po-&#xD;
sition by tremblingly recounting the facts, with&#xD;
her recent companion's share thereof left out.&#xD;
In the midst of this recital, and while the clergy-&#xD;
man was again ecstatically thrilling his being by&#xD;
reconciling the apparition he had seen with the&#xD;
belief in a supernatural transformation of his&#xD;
wife's spirit, a crash in the gallery was heard.&#xD;
In less than two minutes, Mr. Toplady was igno-&#xD;
miniously brought a captive to the vestibule by&#xD;
the clerical serving-man and two shop-keepers.&#xD;
From the belfry-tower, through mysterious and&#xD;
unfinished regions, he had miraculously crawled&#xD;
into the organ loft, and upon the top of'its noble&#xD;
instrument. There he had been disturbed by a&#xD;
sense of suffocation and-by-living things, An-&#xD;
noyed with two spiders in his left ear, he had at-&#xD;
tempted to change his position, and broken into&#xD;
the body of the organ. At his appearance the&#xD;
ill-balanced Mr. Elwell charged hostilely forward,&#xD;
but was restrained by his fellow-invalids.&#xD;
" Let me at him! I'll have his heart! I&#xD;
want his liver and tripe ! Let me go !" cried he&#xD;
in his rage.&#xD;
The lady went into hysterics, and Mr. Toplady&#xD;
into a wild protestation of his own innocence.&#xD;
His hurried attempts at explanation were of no&#xD;
use now. To quiet the frenzy of his antagonist,&#xD;
he was finally hustled from the scene through the&#xD;
rectory, while the husband was forcibly prevent-&#xD;
ed from following him. He was secreted by&#xD;
friends in an unknown place foi the night, and&#xD;
the next morning at early dawn left the village&#xD;
on a cattle-train.&#xD;

made partially allayed tihe gossiping excitement&#xD;
which existed in the neighborhood, but failed,&#xD;
&#xD;
perhaps fortunately for her, to convince her sus-&#xD;
picious husband, and a final and permanent sepa.&#xD;
ration shortly took place between them. The&#xD;
only party who suffered to any degree from the&#xD;
event, was Mr. Toplady, and he, perhaps, more in&#xD;
feeling than reputation, for such an one as he ob-&#xD;
tained is exceedingly popular nowadays.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIX.&#xD;
MOSES CATCHES THE MANNERS LIVING AS THEY&#xD;
RISE.&#xD;
MosEs plunged in society, With Mr. Titman&#xD;
he visited Mrs. Jones D'Aubyn, wife of John&#xD;
Jones Dobbin, wholesale dealer in shivers, on a&#xD;
lovely reception-day. They found her gilded sa-&#xD;
loon crowded with the beau monde.&#xD;
"How amiable of you!" immediately exclaim-&#xD;
ed Miss D'Aubyn, a young lady recently finished&#xD;
by the celebrated Madame Des Minauderies, ad-&#xD;
dressing Moses, as he and Titman bowed. "C'est&#xD;
votre ami, c'est le mien / A! /quelle surprise!"&#xD;
"Mr. Titman esteems it a high honor, Miss&#xD;
D'Aubyn," replied Moses, " to be presented to&#xD;
you."&#xD;
" Al! quelle reconnaissance nous vous devons /"&#xD;
" Wee /" said Mr. Titan, as Moses left to pay&#xD;
his respects to Mrs. D'Aubyn.&#xD;
"And Jiow much Mr. Titman resemble au&#xD;
Comte Phoolanass   C'est etonnant!/ Est-ce que&#xD;
ivous l'avez jamais vu, Umplishoo Titmong ?"&#xD;
P" Wee-/" said Mr. Titman.&#xD;
" Vraiment, et vous savez combien vous ees 1"4&#xD;
meme ?"&#xD;
" Wee," said Mr. Titman.&#xD;
" Votre ami in'a dit, que vous m'avez vu a la&#xD;
promenade en carosse.  Mais dit moi    OC'est&#xD;
vrai, n'est ce pas, gue vous etesfiatteur et dejafati.&#xD;
gud de moi?"&#xD;
" Wee I" said Mr. Titman.&#xD;
"Eh bien, j'ai l'honneur de vous souhaiter le&#xD;
bonjour I" replied the young lady, at once majes-&#xD;
tically rising and leaving Mr. Titman to specu-&#xD;
late upon the cause 6f her abrupt departure.&#xD;
He presently paid his attention to a lady visi.&#xD;
tor near by.&#xD;
" I think I met you in Rome," said she to&#xD;
him graciously.*&#xD;
" Oy!no. I have never been there!"&#xD;
" Ahi I remember it was on the Rhine 1" con-&#xD;
tinued she, smiling.&#xD;
"No, I have never been abroad, madam !"&#xD;
"Will you have the kindness to excuse me&#xD;
from farther conversation, sir ?"&#xD;
"Certainly !" replied Mr. Titman, in some as-&#xD;
tonishment at observing her leaving him too.&#xD;
He immediately entered into conversation with&#xD;
another. "Do you belong to the Union or New-&#xD;
York Club, Mr. Titman ?" asked she.&#xD;
"To neither, madam. I belong to no club,"&#xD;
replied Titman.&#xD;
"Sir, did I hear correctly ?"&#xD;
" Oh ! yes, ma'am."&#xD;
"Excuse me,     friend wishes to speak with&#xD;
me upon the ot r side of the room. Good-&#xD;
morning, sir !"1&#xD;
Hie presently joined another, after the manner&#xD;
of the other beauxe circulating about the room.&#xD;
"I congratulate' you upon your coming into&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
88&#xD;
&#xD;
your property, sir,0 said this lady, who was the&#xD;
anxious mother of three unmarried daughters.&#xD;
"I hear that you inherit a large estateI"&#xD;
" Oh! no. The rumor, if there possibly can be&#xD;
one about me, is quite incorrect," replied the&#xD;
modest Titman.&#xD;
"Then you are not in possession of a large&#xD;
estate ?" asked the anxious mother, who had in-&#xD;
vented this rapid method of finding out where&#xD;
large estates lay.&#xD;
"1I may say not, madam."&#xD;
"Then you will excuse me from asking you&#xD;
if my conversation does not seem disagreeable&#xD;
to you, for I know it really must be, and I will&#xD;
not trouble you longer."&#xD;
The unsuccessful Titman immediately essayed&#xD;
ic another quarter to start a conversation.&#xD;
" HaI ha! ha! ha l" said the vivacious belle,&#xD;
whom he saluted.&#xD;
" Ha! ha! ha! ha!" replied he.&#xD;
" Ha ! ha! ha !" continued she affably.&#xD;
"Ha! ha! ha " responded he with increased&#xD;
vigor.&#xD;
" Ha ! ha !" ejaculated she jocosely.&#xD;
" Ha ! ha!" acknowledged he gracefully.&#xD;
" Ha! a-hum V" concluded she. "I must now&#xD;
leave you."&#xD;
" Thank you!" murmured he sotto voce, and&#xD;
thereupon he rather hastily sought Moses, who&#xD;
was momentarily engaged with a Mr. St. Beauty,&#xD;
a peculiar exotic in the New-York parterre of&#xD;
fashion.&#xD;
" I say, Moses," said he, in rather disrespect-&#xD;
ful perplexity, "that old woman over there is&#xD;
disgusted because I don't belong toa club l"&#xD;
"Eccentrictties of the day, monsieur, You&#xD;
must humor them; only way to get along. You&#xD;
should join a club. I am on a good footing at&#xD;
four. Regularly club-footed, ha, ha !" interposed&#xD;
the accomplished exotic, displaying a remarkable&#xD;
knowledge of the English, even to its capacity&#xD;
for wit. "Like cooking, institution of my coun-&#xD;
try, sir. Won't do to be American here, mon-&#xD;
sieur, even to your boots. I brought a case&#xD;
with me from Paris; knew I couldn't stir a step&#xD;
in society without 'em! "&#xD;
This gentleman, Hippolyte Isador Georges de&#xD;
St. Beauty by name, whom Moses had frequently&#xD;
met before in the mansions of polite society, pro-&#xD;
fessed to be of noble French extraction, but of&#xD;
an exiled family, naturalized to the English soil.&#xD;
From his conversation it was well known in so-&#xD;
ciety that this anglicized Gaul was in some way&#xD;
attached to the secret service of the Foreign Of-&#xD;
fice in London, although he had frequently hint-&#xD;
ed that his real object was the restoration of the&#xD;
Bourbons to the throne of his native land., Mr.&#xD;
Titman was at once inspired with his good sense&#xD;
and liveliness, and when the three presently&#xD;
joined a charming group of ladies, successfully&#xD;
emulated the vivacious.diplomat's ease and con-&#xD;
sciousness of popularity.&#xD;
The conversation which ensued with these fair&#xD;
beings we hardly know to what to compare. The&#xD;
subjects which they seemed most fondly to dwell&#xD;
upon were certainly very proper ones, and such&#xD;
as need a thorough handling in society at the&#xD;
present day-novels, four-in-hand, preachers,&#xD;
dances, the opera, the theatre, paintings, frame-&#xD;
making, busts, and embroidery. And besIdes, ma-&#xD;
ny of them, even if the fair beings did not know&#xD;
much about them, were judiciously chosen, for&#xD;
&#xD;
89&#xD;
&#xD;
they showed what dancers, singers, painters, ac-&#xD;
tresses, varnishers, engravers, and embroiderers&#xD;
the coterie was composed of. Even upon areli-&#xD;
tecture, Mr. Titman had an opportunity of burst-&#xD;
ing forth in safety, and his quotation of the clo-&#xD;
quent Knoblesdorff's exordium about stereobatic&#xD;
caryatids, tryglyphs, mutules and antifixe was&#xD;
received with a flattering appreciation. To re-&#xD;
produce the various remarks elicited from these&#xD;
young ladies would be impossible, for they were&#xD;
like a compound of essences, so volatile in their&#xD;
nature and so exquisitely blended that they escape&#xD;
upon the first attempt to analyze them. Like&#xD;
silvery soap-suds which even while we gaze on&#xD;
them shift their hues and forms, dissolving into&#xD;
air and light and rainbow showers. Like the&#xD;
May mornings, flush with opening flowers and&#xD;
roseate dews and "charm of earliest birds," en-&#xD;
deavoring to catch the unsuspecting worm. Like&#xD;
the mountain streamlet, ever leaping and spark-&#xD;
ling in the sunshine, or rather like the very sun-&#xD;
shine itself, for so the genial glare of fashion&#xD;
touched into conspicuous originality even the&#xD;
vacant atmosphere it shone upon. There was&#xD;
here no mischievous use of the faculties. That&#xD;
of wit, the perilous possession of which subjects&#xD;
woman to the loss of that sweetness of disposi-&#xD;
tion, that delicacy of sentiment which is her ap-&#xD;
propriate grace, and without which every other&#xD;
quality loses its charm, it was quite evident had&#xD;
been very properly suppressed by astute school-&#xD;
teachers in the training of these young ladies.&#xD;
And if they displayed their judgment only upon&#xD;
frivolous subjects, it was certainly very fortu-&#xD;
nate, for with the ambitious disposition fostered&#xD;
by their education it might be decidedly danger-&#xD;
ous in more momentous matters. If their mem-&#xD;
ory was properly attuned to remember the faults&#xD;
of others and forget their own, is not this an&#xD;
enviable state to attain ? And if their imagina-&#xD;
tion was just brilliant enough to enable them to&#xD;
appreciate. the sensation novels of the day and&#xD;
to surround themselves with a halo of import-&#xD;
ance, could it be deemed poor or undirected ?&#xD;
Every body knows and feels that there must&#xD;
be some dominant vice, some ruling weakness&#xD;
prevailing in every human heart-and is not that&#xD;
of vanity, of a fondness for admiration, the most&#xD;
harmless of all ? Is it not ineradicable from the&#xD;
human breast? In the most primitive forms of&#xD;
society is not fondness for admiration just as&#xD;
strong as in the most civilized and refined? The&#xD;
savage belle is tickled with the beads and bits&#xD;
of glass around her neck and the rings in her&#xD;
nose, and the bosom of the civilized one natur-&#xD;
ally swells with .a conscious thrill as she ob-&#xD;
serves that the "adornment of her person is a&#xD;
mark of envy. And if it is thus ineradicable,&#xD;
and if it is one of the most powerful incentives&#xD;
to application and study, the teachers of the pres-&#xD;
ent day have certainly been right in making it&#xD;
the foundation of their system of education.&#xD;
And if the external accomplishments which they&#xD;
aim at are the most rapid and visible im acquire-&#xD;
ment, they have certainly been sensible in espe-&#xD;
cially directing their efforts to those.&#xD;
And we have no doubt Moses felt so. To be&#xD;
sure, he may have expected in the great prog-&#xD;
ress which civiization has made sice the world&#xD;
commenced, that woman should begin to wishl&#xD;
to be admired for something else besides her ex-.&#xD;
ternal accomplishments, her paraphernalia, and&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7256-00000046"/>&#xD;
90                               MR. WIN]&#xD;
her knowledge of the forms and ceremonials of&#xD;
society. He may have hardly wished to suppose&#xD;
that the very persons who feel themselves called&#xD;
upon, and indeed are generally considered as&#xD;
representing the elegance and refinement of a&#xD;
community, should be unaware of what real re-&#xD;
finement consists. He may have preferred to see&#xD;
those delicate young creatures, so lovely in per-&#xD;
son and engaging in manners, instead of sacri-&#xD;
ficing their hearts and minds to the sophisticat-&#xD;
ed, costly and vapid pleasures of fashion, adorn-&#xD;
ing the endearing situations of domestic life,&#xD;
multiplying its comforts by fulfilling its-duties,&#xD;
and in the exercise of every womanly virtue, an-&#xD;
imating retirement, and embellishing the charm-&#xD;
ing scenes of family delight. But if there was&#xD;
any thing cruel and inhuman in this~ system of&#xD;
education it could not be laid to the fashionable&#xD;
teachers of the day. Their humanity as well as&#xD;
their famed thoroughness might be seen in the&#xD;
charming naisveti of these young ladies, by which&#xD;
they appeared wholly unaware they were not in&#xD;
woman's true sphere; in the innocent uncon-&#xD;
sciousness that vulgarity itself may be clothed&#xD;
in external refinement, in the happy infatuation&#xD;
that men of sense are accustomed to look for&#xD;
their home companions in the resorts of vanity.&#xD;
We have therefore every reason to believe that&#xD;
Moses walked away quite satisfied with what he&#xD;
had seen and heard. Mr. St. Beauty was also&#xD;
eminently sensible in his criticisms thereon.&#xD;
"They are very original, very original, air.-&#xD;
Totally different from European society.  The&#xD;
ladies here display more genius. They somehow&#xD;
succeed in being admired for their accomplish-&#xD;
ments, without having any."&#xD;
"Yes, they do not need even external ac-&#xD;
quirements to render them charming !" replied&#xD;
Moses chivalrously.&#xD;
"Very true, very true. Let me see-do you&#xD;
dine at Delmonico's ?" continued the diplomat&#xD;
carelessly.&#xD;
- " At the Evercroft," replied Moses. "I was&#xD;
about proceeding there for that purpose, and-.."'&#xD;
"Certainly. With pleasure," said the eccen-&#xD;
tric diplomat promptly. "Yes, woman is our&#xD;
great support, sir. -She at once charms us, sus-&#xD;
tains us, ad smooths our-"&#xD;
Here the lively attce h6 manifested a sudden&#xD;
desire to bolt across the street, which he man-&#xD;
aged, however, to repress, as one of the beings&#xD;
upon whom he had commenced his gallant en-&#xD;
comium, namely, a female with a basket upon&#xD;
her arm, rather abruptly appeared before him&#xD;
and addressed him.&#xD;
"I want you-to pay my bill. I've waited long&#xD;
enough for it " said she rather peremptorily.&#xD;
" My good woman, you---"&#xD;
"You needn't good-woman me. I've watched&#xD;
for you, and caught you at last," continued she,&#xD;
raising her voice. "I've done his washing for&#xD;
the last six months and haven't got a cent for it&#xD;
yet," said she, by way of explanation, at the ev-&#xD;
dent astonishment of the accompanying gentle-&#xD;
men.&#xD;
l1Very true. She is my washerwoman, but&#xD;
she is a little touched here," hastily whispered&#xD;
the diplomat to Moses and placing his handy sig-&#xD;
nificantly upon his forehead. "Insane,,sir{ in-&#xD;
sane ! I keep her out of charity. Aheifrisacre,&#xD;
my good woman, you--"&#xD;
"I want my 'bill settled, I tell you, and, I'll&#xD;
&#xD;
I'&#xD;
&#xD;
FIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
have it now I" reiterated the woman rather&#xD;
fiercely.&#xD;
" Blast it, sacre, she'll create a scene. I must&#xD;
humor her," continued the diplomat to Moses.&#xD;
" My good woman, one moment. I hereby call&#xD;
upon these gentlemen to take notice that I for-&#xD;
mally adopt you as my daughter, and-"&#xD;
" I want my bill I" cried the woman with more&#xD;
force than ever.       I&#xD;
"And-and I have already made my will in&#xD;
your favor, my good woman, sacreifenmme, and&#xD;
here are two dollars on account, and-Mr. Wink,&#xD;
field, you haven't a couple of dollars about you,&#xD;
have you ?" asked Mr. St. Beauty, feeling hur-&#xD;
riedly in his pockets, in pursuance of his hu-&#xD;
mane purpose of humoring the woman's singu-&#xD;
lar aberration. "Left all my small change at&#xD;
home. Foutre, nomndijew ,,&#xD;
" Certainly," said the affable Moses.&#xD;
The woman received the two dollars. Mr. St.&#xD;
Beauty further solemnly agreed to meet her at&#xD;
her lodgings with the rest- of the bill at ten&#xD;
o'clock precisely on the following morning, and&#xD;
still indulging her partially appeased hallucina-&#xD;
tion with indistinct mutters, the unhappy lunatic&#xD;
walked away, leaving Mr. Winkfield and Mr. Tit-&#xD;
man deeply excited with compassion for her un-&#xD;
fortunate condition.&#xD;
CHAPTER XL.&#xD;
THE FoURTH OF JULY.&#xD;
THE Fourth of July Moses felt, in common&#xD;
with his fellow-citizens, was a day especially&#xD;
worthy of their commemoration, though, perhaps,&#xD;
as an impartial philosopher, he would have said&#xD;
that the 12th of October, 1492, ought to have a&#xD;
share of the honor. It naturally follows that if&#xD;
there had not been.a discovery of America, there&#xD;
would not have been any American colonies, and&#xD;
if there had been no American colonies, there&#xD;
would not have been any Declaration of Indepen-&#xD;
dence. However, it is to be presumed, that on&#xD;
the morning of the anniversary he rose, infected&#xD;
with the general enthusiasm and ready to make&#xD;
the day an occasion for patriotic feats and expres-&#xD;
sions of national gratitude. Like a patriot of "76,&#xD;
he scorned further slumber, especially as he had&#xD;
been aroused therefrom before light by the noise&#xD;
of explosions--principally by boys who had lain&#xD;
awake for three nights previous speculating upon&#xD;
how early they should rise out the important day&#xD;
-and as at early dawn the incessant sounds of&#xD;
drums, and the tramping of horses, together with&#xD;
a long altercation, which took place directly&#xD;
under his window, rendered any further attempt&#xD;
at sleep entirely useless. He threw open his&#xD;
blinds, and the fresh morning breeze wooed his&#xD;
locks. Performing his ablutions and clothing&#xD;
himself, he then awaited with a pleasant perusal&#xD;
of the glorious constitution of the United States,&#xD;
the hour of breakfast. When that was finished,&#xD;
he sallied out in company with Mr. Titman to&#xD;
witness the military spectacle upon the Washing-&#xD;
ton Parade. After dodging runaway horses -and&#xD;
passing over frightful mines, which were explod-&#xD;
ing all along the route, enveloping them in smoke&#xD;
and causing Mr. Titman to make numerous con-&#xD;
vulsive leaps into the air, they reached that de-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WIN&#xD;
lightful park in safety. It was filled with files&#xD;
of soldiers at ease, and with spectators of all ages&#xD;
and both sexes, pushing and squeezing each other&#xD;
in trying to become so.&#xD;
This is delightful. A very good spot to see&#xD;
the spectacle," said Moses, after they had with&#xD;
some difficulty selected a position on the principal&#xD;
avenue. "Only I don't like the way in which&#xD;
that boy near us is playing with his pistol. He&#xD;
will certainly injure himself." Simultaneously&#xD;
with these words the pistol went off and our hero&#xD;
received a very heavy wad and some powder&#xD;
therefrom ia the side of hie head.&#xD;
"Are you hurt ?" asked Titman in alarm.&#xD;
"Oh! no, not at all. But where is that reck-&#xD;
less little rascal?"&#xD;
" Oh! he has gone off, too," replied Titman.&#xD;
"Do you think he did it purposely ?" asked&#xD;
Moses, rubbing his temple.&#xD;
"I don't know," replied Titman.&#xD;
Well, if he did it purposely, I think I should&#xD;
follow him and thrash him-I think I should,&#xD;
indeed. Ah! there is Mr. Wagybull under that&#xD;
tree."&#xD;
"Yes; and there's Barnard in the military,"&#xD;
added Titman.   See Company B, Seventh Regi-&#xD;
meit"1&#xD;
While they were making efforts at recognition&#xD;
by these friends, Mr. Titman jumped forward in a&#xD;
lively manner. His position interfering with the&#xD;
view of a party behind him, the latter had&#xD;
promptly stuck a pin into his leg to alter it.&#xD;
" He-stuck a pin into me!" said Titman. "I&#xD;
saw him!"&#xD;
" What do you mean by that ?" said Moses to&#xD;
the man angrily. A large crowd immediately&#xD;
.Surrounded them.&#xD;
" I didn't !" said the man.&#xD;
"Do you deny the outrage ?" said Moses in a&#xD;
loud voice. "My friend saw you!"&#xD;
.1I can't help that. I didn't stick a pin into&#xD;
him. It was a needle, boys !" said the man with'&#xD;
a grin to the crowd.&#xD;
At this information the latter laughed quite&#xD;
heartily, and a man with a bulldog and a breath&#xD;
fragrant with plantation-bitters, shoved against&#xD;
Moses in his ecstasy, and attempted to grind him&#xD;
against a tree. Our hero would bave undoubt-&#xD;
edly undertaken, in spite of circumstances, to&#xD;
avenge these gross aggravations upon the part of&#xD;
his fellow-citizens, if a masked battery had not here&#xD;
been let off near them with such dreadful power,&#xD;
that even the general turned- pale, although all&#xD;
his campaigns had been made on this field. The&#xD;
attention of the crowd was turned to the military,&#xD;
the review of which was now to take place. The&#xD;
regiments formed into a more perfect line on the&#xD;
avenue, while the general and his staff arranged&#xD;
their hair, and made other preparations for gal-&#xD;
lantly riding down before it. Presently the bands&#xD;
struck up "Hail to the Chief," and the general&#xD;
commenced to move. The crowd commenced a&#xD;
parallel movement, and, in the pressure, Moses,&#xD;
Mr. Titman, and Mr. Wagbull were shoved later-&#xD;
aity past the policemen and sentries. Unable to&#xD;
penetrate the human wall on either side and agi-&#xD;
tated by the threat of the guard, they promptly&#xD;
joined the staff of the commanding officer, and&#xD;
walked therein, three abreast, down the entire&#xD;
line. Though they were thus obliged to forego&#xD;
the intended gratification of witnessing the spec-&#xD;
tacle, they were enlivened with perhaps more ex-&#xD;
&#xD;
[KFIELD.                                 91&#xD;
hilarating emotions; for under the impression that&#xD;
they were distinguished personages from a foreign&#xD;
nation, the crowd at all points greeted themi with&#xD;
huge cries of extollation, and after they had ex-&#xD;
tricated themselves at the end of the avenue, they&#xD;
were followed for many moments by a branch&#xD;
mob of considerable dimensions, contending with&#xD;
enthusiastic blows and vociferation, for the honor&#xD;
of shaking hands with them.   As they were&#xD;
hastily leaving the park, perhaps from a fear of a&#xD;
repetition of this unexpected ovation, they fell in&#xD;
with Mr. Lampson, the historal scholar of the&#xD;
Archnological Society, with two little boys, neatly&#xD;
collared.&#xD;
"These are my sons, Thomas and Joseph, Mr.&#xD;
Winkfield," said he proudly.&#xD;
Papa's going to take us up to Fourteenth&#xD;
street now, to see the soldiers go by, and Tom&#xD;
and I have got five cents to spend I" said the&#xD;
youngest impressively.&#xD;
"You are a good little boy, and so is Toni,"&#xD;
said Moses, feeling in his pocket, in which he&#xD;
mysteriously discovered a stale sandwich and&#xD;
several pieces of orange-peel.&#xD;
Here the worthy author of the forthcoming&#xD;
sensation on Simkinson launched forth into chap-&#xD;
ter twenty-seven of that work, beingm a minute&#xD;
expatiation upon the influence which that arch&#xD;
conspirator caine near exercising upon the world-&#xD;
renowned piece of history commemorated by the&#xD;
day, and affected thereby not to take notice of&#xD;
Moses's benignant addition to the boys' five cents.&#xD;
During this learned exposition, the infants entered&#xD;
into a little contest as to the disposition of the&#xD;
unexpected fortune they had come into.&#xD;
"Tom, let's buy a bunch of fire crackers, and&#xD;
some peanut candy!" said the younger.&#xD;
" No, Josie1" replied the other gravely. "We&#xD;
must buy something for mamma.- The gentleman&#xD;
expects us."&#xD;
".But-ean't we have the fire-crackers1" said&#xD;
Josie disapp-i.tedly. "I want some so much,&#xD;
and so do you, Tommy, don't you ?"&#xD;
Perhaps we may-no, there's just enough to&#xD;
buy her a pair of gloves, don't you see, Josic ?"&#xD;
said Tom, making a great effort to appear serene.&#xD;
I'll buy one, and you buy the other!"&#xD;
Good! Crikey, Tommie, won't mamma laugh,&#xD;
when she finds 'em under her plate? We'll put 'em&#xD;
under her plate, and it will be such fun!" said&#xD;
Josie, enthused with the new idea, and thereupon&#xD;
they both indulged in youthful gyrations at the&#xD;
thought.&#xD;
What affection! I see you bring up these&#xD;
little fellows rightly, Mr. Lampson," exclaimed&#xD;
Moses, who had been voluntarily paying more&#xD;
attention to them than to the worthy scholar.&#xD;
"You teach them frugality and the glorious habit&#xD;
of self-denial."&#xD;
. "Yes," replied the scholar rather pompously.&#xD;
"I hold, sir, that they will thank nie for these&#xD;
habits of economy, especially when they grow&#xD;
up and come into possession of their property, sir."&#xD;
"But you will allow me, thing once, to break&#xD;
through your discipline ?" said Moses.&#xD;
" Certainly. Coming from you it will be qimte&#xD;
correct," replied the scholar affably. Whereupon&#xD;
Moses added another half-dollar for the fire-&#xD;
crackers, aiid after responding to the wvorthy&#xD;
scholar's renewed proffer of the hospitality of&#xD;
Westchester county, left the party to proceed&#xD;
with their frugal enjoyment of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7256-00000047"/>&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
As Mr. Wagbull here suggested to our hero&#xD;
and Mr. Titman, whether as a piece of republican&#xD;
satire or otherwise, that they might perhaps de-&#xD;
rive new and valuable ideas of the political inter-&#xD;
ests of the country, in attending a civic celebra-&#xD;
tion of the day by the Tammany Young Men's&#xD;
Democratic Association at the Cooper Institute,&#xD;
they proceeded to that place.- The regular chair-&#xD;
man of the association being hopelessly drunk,&#xD;
Judge Pootoops had been extemporaneously&#xD;
called upon to preside, and was already in the&#xD;
chair, nursing his grandeur, and with a manifest&#xD;
determination upon his countenance to sustain&#xD;
the party in this impressive hour to the best of&#xD;
his abilities. Moses was in time to hear his in-&#xD;
troductory remarks, which he applauded with&#xD;
friendly vociferation, though he would not exactly&#xD;
reicho the sentiments thereof, as the justice en-&#xD;
deavored to show that if all the patriots of the&#xD;
Revolution were not democrats, at least all the&#xD;
republicans of the present day were tories, The&#xD;
Declaration of Independence was then read. that&#xD;
is, our friends supposed it was that interesting&#xD;
document, though it might have been a short&#xD;
history of Jack the Giant-killer, or Dr. Brandreth's&#xD;
advertisement, for all the efforts to make him-&#xD;
self heard of the consumptive gentleman wht was&#xD;
intrusted with the performance. The great point&#xD;
of the day was now reached, the oration. A cel-&#xD;
ebrated and rotund statesman from Washington&#xD;
had been engaged, who proceeded at once to dis-&#xD;
play his "matchless eloquence, his profound lore,&#xD;
and the unconquerable love of his country, for&#xD;
which his patriotic youth, his congressional ex-&#xD;
perience of thirty years, his diplomatic services&#xD;
abroad of twenty years more, and the general&#xD;
studious occupations of the closet for a half a&#xD;
century, (making in all one hundred and twenty&#xD;
years,) so eminently possessed him of." It cer-&#xD;
tainly was a great effort, or, at least, would have&#xD;
been, if he had not been short-winded and incor-&#xD;
rigibly given to mixing his metaphors.  He&#xD;
"grasped with his eyo the events of the Revolu-&#xD;
tion, and drank in with heavenly rapture the&#xD;
broad platform of its principles. The proud eagle&#xD;
of liberty laughed to scorn the despots of the old&#xD;
world, sifted the chaff of selfishness from the'&#xD;
wheat of patriotism in the hearts of our ancestors,&#xD;
and with one stern flap of his wings purging&#xD;
them of discord, produced the Declaration of In-&#xD;
dependence. On the volcano's brink, the patriots&#xD;
made hay as the sun of opportunity shone, and&#xD;
boldly seizing the bull by the horns, crammed&#xD;
the unpalatable morsel down the throats of the&#xD;
aghast tyrants. In the ma5lstrom of the conflict,&#xD;
they left no stone unturned, and strained every&#xD;
nerve in hot water, to eat the golden fruit of lib-&#xD;
erty," etc., etc. During this rhetorical confusion,&#xD;
Judge Pootoops had slipped out to refresh his&#xD;
presiding energy at a neighboring bar-room, and&#xD;
in his return, encountered Moses and party,&#xD;
"Fine oration, sir," said he to our hero.&#xD;
"Celebrated man. It was a great stroke for the'&#xD;
party in securing him. It .will have an effect&#xD;
upon the coming election. We give him a dinner&#xD;
after the meeting."&#xD;
"Ah! it is a pleasant thing to see the country&#xD;
grateful to one of its great men for his long ser-&#xD;
vices," replied Moses.&#xD;
"Yes," continued the judge. "Yes; we sell&#xD;
the tickets and will have money enough over to&#xD;
buy a hundred votes l"&#xD;
&#xD;
"To buy a hundred votes!" repeated Moses,&#xD;
in some confusion.&#xD;
- "Yes, sir. He is a great card, and truly a&#xD;
valuable statesman. His efforts have been un-&#xD;
tiring in adjusting the unhappy sectional differ-&#xD;
ences of our country, sir."&#xD;
"And he is justly honored for that !" said&#xD;
Moses warmly.&#xD;
" He was paid five thousand dollars by the&#xD;
South for one speech alone, sir, on the Kansas&#xD;
question," continued the judge impressively.&#xD;
"Ah !" ejaculated Moses, waning somewhat in&#xD;
his enthusiasm, and turning his attention to the&#xD;
assemblage. "You have a fine audience here,&#xD;
judge."&#xD;
" All democrats and members of. the club.&#xD;
We are the association, sir. The other club is&#xD;
nowhere-mere faction, sir. They threatened&#xD;
to turn out and interrupt the proceedings, but&#xD;
they haven't dared to show their heads. They&#xD;
claim to be the regular Young Men's Association,&#xD;
and are mad with despair and envy at our influ-&#xD;
ence in the party, sir. Most singular thing, I&#xD;
haven't seen one of 'em to-day," continued the&#xD;
judge, revealing a state of affairs within the&#xD;
party, which certainly called for the pacificating&#xD;
ability of the orator of the day. " Splendid&#xD;
thing, sir, the club principle; it consolidates the&#xD;
voting interest, sir, and directs it upon the right&#xD;
men."&#xD;
"Very true, very true, Mr. Justice," inter-&#xD;
posed Mr. Wagbull warmly. "It is the only true&#xD;
way of securing the blessings of popular suffrage,&#xD;
sir, of enlarging the boundaries of human civili-&#xD;
zation to comprehend the liberal views and en-&#xD;
lghtened policy of one of the most remarkable in-&#xD;
stances of liberty and enlightenment, which as a&#xD;
policy of-I may say-under the circumstances-&#xD;
which-"&#xD;
" Certainly," said Judge Pootoops, staring at,&#xD;
the speaker.&#xD;
"I beg pardon, Judge Pootoops, this is Mr.&#xD;
Wagbull, a gentleman who takes great interest&#xD;
in the political affairs of the city and exercises no&#xD;
small influence, I believe, therein,'Z said Moses.&#xD;
" Wagbull!   I never heard of him  before.&#xD;
Not a republican, I hope. But excuse me, gen-&#xD;
tlemen, I must leave you. You will stay, of&#xD;
course, and join in the procession. We move&#xD;
down to the Seminole House in Canal street,&#xD;
where we dine. By the way, here are three&#xD;
tickets to the banquet for you and your friends,",&#xD;
whispered the judge to Moses in a burst of gen-&#xD;
erosity. "Be on hand, and I'll see you get good&#xD;
places." -&#xD;
. Delighted with this friendship on the part of&#xD;
the judge, and with the prospect of hearing the&#xD;
speeches of the entertainment, Moses and Mr.&#xD;
Titman prevailed upon Mr. Wagbull to accept of&#xD;
one of the tickets, and they remained until the con-&#xD;
clusion of the exercises in the hall, which shortly&#xD;
took place.  The association defiled into the&#xD;
street with the judge at its head. The edge of the&#xD;
procession was much taken off at the commence-&#xD;
ment by the premature marching off of the band,&#xD;
which reached the end of the block before it was&#xD;
apprised of its mistake. Though Judge Pootoops&#xD;
and the entire procession were obliged to run for&#xD;
some time in a very undignified manner~ to over-&#xD;
take it, they nevertheless ultimately recovered&#xD;
their ceremonious bearing, and in due grandeur&#xD;
the association reached the place of banqueting,&#xD;
&#xD;
92&#xD;
&#xD;
93&#xD;
&#xD;
to which Moses and his friends speedily followed.&#xD;
The procession halted upon the pavement for a&#xD;
moment and then proceeded up the staircase.&#xD;
But it had but partially mounted the same, when&#xD;
a rumor ran down it and into the street which&#xD;
seemed to strike the entire 'association with&#xD;
ghastly and sickening feelings. Many members&#xD;
trembled, and for support sought the walls of&#xD;
the building; others convulsively threw up their&#xD;
arms in the air; others clutched their hair, while&#xD;
the majority pressed madly and recklessly up-&#xD;
stairs and into the banqueting-hall.&#xD;
"I can't help that, sar, it iseat !" said the ne-&#xD;
gro, caterer and proprietor of the hall, in agitated&#xD;
converse with Judge rootoops. "I-can't help&#xD;
who paid me for it. I got up the dinner all reg-&#xD;
lar, and the association has been here and eat it!&#xD;
Dat's all I knows about it 1"&#xD;
"But we are the association ! Don't you see&#xD;
us ?" shrieked the judge in the agony of doubt&#xD;
and despair, "and we have come to cat the din-&#xD;
ner you were paid to prepare for us !"&#xD;
" It isn't going' on morc'n half an hour since&#xD;
the Young Men's Dimmicrat 'Siety was here, and&#xD;
they cat every thin' up in no time and then left&#xD;
right off, every one of 'em !" said the colored&#xD;
ian determinedly.&#xD;
The unusual quiet, the mysterious non-appear-&#xD;
ance of the opposing faction in the presence of&#xD;
the association, to which the judge had referred&#xD;
at the Institute, was now only too well explained!&#xD;
By an adroit and consummate plan of vengeance,&#xD;
played upon the innocent ignorance of the colored&#xD;
men who had gotten up the dinner, the enemy&#xD;
had stolen into the camp, while the association&#xD;
was placidly listening to the eloquence of the&#xD;
Washington statesman, and quietly eaten up their&#xD;
proposed dinner !&#xD;
"How was I for to come for to go to tell ?&#xD;
They came all regular in a procession, and had a&#xD;
small banner !" replied the colored caterer, en.&#xD;
deavoring to defend himself' against-the the out-&#xD;
cries and threatening gesticulations of the mad&#xD;
crowd which surrounded him.&#xD;
The unhappy members stared at the empty&#xD;
plates and at each other in petrifaction.&#xD;
"We's all tought it was a 'singler Fourth of&#xD;
July feed, sar," continued the caterer, beginning&#xD;
to be converted to the new theory of affairs.&#xD;
" They was not over twenty minutes about it, sar.&#xD;
There wasn't no toasts, no sayin' nothin' at all.&#xD;
They was kept silent by the head-man and seein'&#xD;
who should eat the fastest, and then they all&#xD;
suddently rushed out of the room and left."&#xD;
It would be in vain to attempt to describe the&#xD;
scenes which followed this astounding discovery.&#xD;
Blame was cast indiscriminately by the outraged&#xD;
members upon the negroes, Judge Pootoops, and&#xD;
each other, and under the influence of maddened&#xD;
disappointment, several animal-like fights en--&#xD;
sued. The negroes were compelled to fly for&#xD;
safety from the disordered scene.  Such mem.&#xD;
bers as were unable to postpone appeasing the&#xD;
cravings of hunger, dispersed to seek luncheons,&#xD;
arduous spirits, and consolation, in neighboring&#xD;
pot-houses, and although Judge Pootoops exerted&#xD;
his utmost to keep the association still intact and&#xD;
restore it to order, by intimating that prompt&#xD;
efforts to replace'the banquet might possibly be&#xD;
snccessfnl by evening, the dastardly trick was&#xD;
only too successful. The organization of the as-&#xD;
semblage was irrecoverably broken up for the&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
day. Many of the dispersed members returned&#xD;
from their private excursions, but only-to hang&#xD;
in knots for the remainder of the day around the&#xD;
scene of disaster, and converse upon the ab-&#xD;
sorbing subject, and the majority broke up into&#xD;
bands, which might be met all over the city&#xD;
howling for vengeance, and hunting for the hid-&#xD;
den enemies until a late hour of the night.&#xD;
Moses and his friends betook themselves to the&#xD;
Evercroft to dine, and satisfied with the day's&#xD;
experience, -he forewent the fireworks and went&#xD;
early to bed.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLI.&#xD;
MOSES AND FRIENDS SET OUT FOR A WATERING-&#xD;
PLACE.&#xD;
IT has been said that there is one word in the&#xD;
vocabulary, more bitter, more direful in its import&#xD;
than all the rest. A distinguished writer has&#xD;
recommended to her readers, if poverty, if dis-&#xD;
grace, if bodily pain, even if slighted love be&#xD;
their unhappy fate, to kneel and bless heaven,&#xD;
for its beneficent influence, so long as they are&#xD;
not tortured with the anguish   of-remorse.&#xD;
Miss Wagbull, for a whole day subsequent to her&#xD;
premeditated and abetted cruelty to Moses,&#xD;
suffered its terrible stings. In vain did she seek&#xD;
to allay its power over her distracted thoughts,&#xD;
in extorting from her maid, within the secret&#xD;
recesses of her boudoir, many compliments for&#xD;
her innocent victim. In vain did she bury her&#xD;
face in the pillows of her couch, when she re-&#xD;
tired. In vain did she rise early the next morn-&#xD;
ing and spend the whole forenoon in shopping.&#xD;
In vain did*she seek in the afternoon the con.&#xD;
solation afforded by the spiritual conversation of&#xD;
her pastor, Dr. Tinker. The evening came ana&#xD;
with it a spirited but touching note from the&#xD;
martyr. Seven more notes followed to and fro&#xD;
in rapid succession, explanatory, amatory, accusa-&#xD;
tory, vindicatory, exculpatory, and reconciliatory.&#xD;
The martyr himself then approached and the&#xD;
whole matter, including the entire correspondence&#xD;
was laboriously discussed, and we question which&#xD;
at the close was the happiest, the triumphant&#xD;
martyr or the repentant tyrant.&#xD;
The day succeeding that of the national&#xD;
jubilee, Moses received a letter from  huis uncle,&#xD;
dated at the celebrated watering-place, Saratoga,&#xD;
containing the information that the writer had&#xD;
left Ilampleboro from its excessive dullness, and&#xD;
had proceeded directly to the Springs. It was&#xD;
agreed upon by Moses and Mr. Titman that&#xD;
nothing would be pleasanter for both than to&#xD;
comply with his desire to have them join him&#xD;
there. To their increased delight Mr. Barnard&#xD;
also determined to go, although they informed&#xD;
him of their plan but three hours before they&#xD;
left. He nevertheless met them on the steam-&#xD;
boat as fresh as a daisy, and as easy about his&#xD;
baggage a if he had not atrunk, threo fishing-&#xD;
rods, a short gun, a horse and saddle, and al&#xD;
Irish groom aboard. The noble Hudson was an&#xD;
object of great interest to our hero. From the&#xD;
deck of the boat he could easily see the magni-&#xD;
ficent-country seats along its banks, with tho&#xD;
people thereof lolling upon thq grass beneath&#xD;
the trees, or sailing in their pleasuire-boats upon&#xD;
the river. Every one he~ descried appeared to be&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7256-00000048"/>&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD.                95&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
replete with tranquil enjoyment, in particular, an&#xD;
old negro fishing on the end of' aprivate dock.&#xD;
Moses's feelings were in unison with the scene,&#xD;
and Titman, infected with a desire for practical&#xD;
Joking, by the presence of his friend Barnard,&#xD;
proposed passing himself off as an Italian count,&#xD;
and was only prevented therefrom, by the latter's&#xD;
suggestion that he might be possibly taken for a'&#xD;
Jw peddler. Music was also lendig its charms&#xD;
to the occasion from the cabin. All the country&#xD;
people who were aboard were taking turns at&#xD;
fingering a piano therein; a proceeding which&#xD;
seemed to be considered by them as a matter&#xD;
expected by the navigation company, and as a&#xD;
duty which they owed to themselves in ob-&#xD;
taining the proper equivalent for the-sum paid by&#xD;
them as passage money. Presently a weak-&#xD;
headed youth from the South, tries a song and&#xD;
breaks down from feeble memory of the words.&#xD;
He immediately proceeds to the coal-hole and&#xD;
practices the same there to the intense delight of&#xD;
tho ctl-heavers. While he is subsequently enter-&#xD;
ing into a conspiracy with a passenger to have the&#xD;
latter call vociferouslyfor it again, a young country&#xD;
gentleman on an ottoman in the corner feels that'&#xD;
the time is now come for him to lead his lady-&#xD;
companion to the instrument, where after much&#xD;
blusiing she consents to comply with his per-&#xD;
sistent requests to give him a "chune," and&#xD;
not only fills his being with ecstasy, and an ar-&#xD;
dent resolve to propose before they arrive "to&#xD;
homte," but apparently from the applause, affords&#xD;
infinite delight to the other passengers presetit:&#xD;
the selection from her repertoire being a chaste&#xD;
and unique arrangement of "Old Dog Tray,"&#xD;
which derived a singular amount of expression&#xD;
from being executed the most of the time with&#xD;
one finger.&#xD;
Upon the spacious boat there were a great&#xD;
many tourists, fashionable and otherwise, includ-&#xD;
ing a lady with nine trunks, and the chatting was&#xD;
of the most agreeable kind. Moses overheard&#xD;
many diverting remarks upon society, the aris-&#xD;
tocracy, and the summer begira of its fair mem-&#xD;
bers. "Mrs. So-and-so goes to a small island this&#xD;
side of Cuba for her health, and Mrs Blatk goes&#xD;
to Europe 1"  Which were no doubt well-au-&#xD;
thenticated pieces of information with some&#xD;
modifications.  The "small island this side of&#xD;
Cuba," being Staten Island, and Mrs. Blank&#xD;
visiting Europe, by going to her father's, the old&#xD;
farmer in the country,-permitting the children to&#xD;
romp, and reading up about the other hemisphere&#xD;
from the guide-books.&#xD;
Moses and Mr. Titman attended supper below,&#xD;
while Mr. Barnard, who had partaken of quite a&#xD;
number of lunches, ere he started from the city,&#xD;
preferred an instructive conversation with the&#xD;
engineer of the boat. As the meal was unsatis-&#xD;
factory to them, from the confinement of the&#xD;
cabin, and from the hard breathing and danger-&#xD;
ous handling of his knife, by a country gentle-&#xD;
nian feeding near them, they returned to the&#xD;
deck after a hasty cup of tea, to continue their&#xD;
inspection of the delightful river, and enjoy the&#xD;
cooling breeze that fanned their brows. At a&#xD;
late hour the party retired, with the exception of&#xD;
Mr. Barnard, who did not go to bed at all, partly&#xD;
from the vivacity of ,his temperament. partly&#xD;
ft-om the nature of his habits, and partly from&#xD;
the soundness of his judgment, which prompted&#xD;
himn to take a hand at short whiist, in an airy&#xD;
&#xD;
saloon, with three commercial travelers, at ten&#xD;
cents a point, rather than to become a prey to&#xD;
unwholesome meditation and insects within a&#xD;
seven-by-four state-room.. About three in the&#xD;
morning, Mr. Titman in his night habiliments&#xD;
rushed from his apartment and sought repose for&#xD;
his exhausted nature upon a bench on the for-&#xD;
ward deck, just as Moses, who by the power of&#xD;
his philosophic habits, had at last overcome the&#xD;
various adversaries of sleep, fell into a gentle&#xD;
slumber. When the boat arrived at Troy, in the&#xD;
morning, Mr. Barnard, taking the lead, .reheved&#xD;
the minds of thirty-three hackmen as to their&#xD;
desire for knowledge of the party's destination,&#xD;
by wringing the nose of the largest, and followed&#xD;
by Moses and Mr. Titman, proceeded to the&#xD;
Coleman House for breakfast. Here they learn-&#xD;
ed that an accident obstructing the track, had&#xD;
occurred to the early morning train from Sara-&#xD;
toga, which would delay their departure three or&#xD;
four hours, and which had been caused by the&#xD;
eccentric desire of a Hibernian switchman on&#xD;
the previous evening to see if there really would&#xD;
be any damage resulting from his leaving his&#xD;
switch, and attending a shillalah party at the&#xD;
village pot-house. The experiment was evident-&#xD;
ly suessful, and the damage was exactly ascer-&#xD;
tained for him, one head being broken upon the&#xD;
engine, and thirty at the party. Moses, with Mr.&#xD;
Tittian seized the opportunity of the delay to&#xD;
mark the manners and dwellings of the Trojans,&#xD;
and Mr. Barnard to pay his respects to one of the&#xD;
principal engine companies of the city, composed&#xD;
of some of the best citizens of the place. These&#xD;
evidently had all the enthusiasm of provincial ad-&#xD;
mirers, for when he returned, his friends learned&#xD;
that upon being discovered in town, the company&#xD;
had gone so far as to assemble, and tender him&#xD;
an impromptu pugilistic contest with a canal-man&#xD;
in a lumber-yard. The fight occurred to the&#xD;
delight of all present, and undoubtedly to the&#xD;
great disappointment of many other of the pr-in&#xD;
cipal men of Troy, who staid away only from&#xD;
ignorance of the affair or from pressure of their&#xD;
engagements.  In this encounter, Mr. Barnard&#xD;
had very humanely closed both eyes of his an-&#xD;
tagonist at the very first round, in order as he&#xD;
afterwards pleasantly expressed it,- that "he&#xD;
might not see what was going to happen to him,"&#xD;
and in consequence of this, the contest had been&#xD;
rather short, but what it lacked from brevity,&#xD;
had been made up in brilliancy ; and amid much&#xD;
enthusiasm, he was further informed that a grand&#xD;
collation to take place that evening would wind&#xD;
up the impromptu festivities, if he and his friends&#xD;
would remain. Notwithstanding this pleasant&#xD;
offer, they left for Saratoga at' the appointed&#xD;
hour, after taking lunch twice, and settling their&#xD;
bill, wherein some little difficulty was experienced&#xD;
from the charges against Mr. Barnard, among&#xD;
the luxuries, for the practical jokes of kissing the&#xD;
chamber-maid and running a waiter into the&#xD;
cellar.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLII.&#xD;
AT THE SPRINGS. MR. PINKSITT, THE ARTIST,&#xD;
AGAIN. A PRETTY PIECE oF BUSINESS TO coM-&#xD;
MENCE WITH.&#xD;
UPON arriving at the Saratoga caravansary, the&#xD;
party found Mr. Toplady, who had already se-&#xD;
&#xD;
cured ample apartments for them, consisting of a&#xD;
spacious double-bedded room, nine feet square,&#xD;
in the hotel, and a nice suite at a pleasant cot-&#xD;
tage in the village, a quarter of a mile distant,&#xD;
with any objections to rain obviated by the nume-&#xD;
rous umbrellas in the possession of its affable&#xD;
proprietor. As Moses professed himself delight-&#xD;
ed with the idea of colonization, Mr. Barnard and&#xD;
Mr. Titman at once seized upon the double-bedded&#xD;
room, to give him an opportunity of realizing it,&#xD;
and after a proper installation and repose, all&#xD;
proceeded systematically to enjoy the life at the&#xD;
Springs. They rose early, attended with regu-&#xD;
larity the races of the tumbler-boys to the foun-&#xD;
tains, drank the waters therefrom, and after the&#xD;
customary sickness and the abolition of any&#xD;
traces of appetite lingering in their systems, inci-&#xD;
dent thereto, underwent the usual form of break-&#xD;
fasting. Mr. Barnard expended his forenoons in&#xD;
the billiard-room. Mr. Toplady passed much of&#xD;
his time with some old friends, accompanying&#xD;
the married ladies with due circumspection,&#xD;
while Moses and Mr. Titman, sauntered with,&#xD;
others in the park, or enjoyed the scene from the&#xD;
balcony. This became a favorite place for our&#xD;
hero, as a philosophic roost. He could survey&#xD;
therefrom the crowds of gayly-dressed pleasure-&#xD;
seekers seated near him or parading below, and&#xD;
speculate at case upon their various characteris-&#xD;
tics. There were ladies blooming in the radiant&#xD;
beauty of youth and health, with their attend-&#xD;
ant beaux, and some blooming by other means,&#xD;
who were attended by theirs. There were ladies&#xD;
dressed in simple attire, andothers in gorgeous re-&#xD;
splendence, including the fair owner of the nine&#xD;
trunks, the contents of some one of which, at the&#xD;
very least, she wore constantly upon her person.&#xD;
There were gouty old fathers and uncles, and dys-&#xD;
peptic elderly gentlemen playing with romping&#xD;
children. There were middle-aged ladies, who,&#xD;
from. their costume, might have been classed&#xD;
among the young ones if they had not dispelled&#xD;
the illusion by acting like little girls. There&#xD;
were heavy dowagers with rough voices and hairs&#xD;
on the nose, and slim ones with a tender solici-&#xD;
tude for their daughters' lungs, and a constant&#xD;
apprehension of their little boys being submerged&#xD;
in the fish-pond. And among these there was&#xD;
much mysterious gossip and match-making and&#xD;
undoing, and the kissing was so prevalent that&#xD;
Titman frequently became bewildered by it, and&#xD;
often lingered near the fair groups with unde.&#xD;
fined expectations. There were, whist parties in&#xD;
the parlors, and croquet parties in the park.&#xD;
There were people yawning from the effects of&#xD;
last night's ball, and others who were still very&#xD;
lively therefrom. And to distinguish them so-&#xD;
cially, there were the sudden mushrooms, who&#xD;
never knew the names of their grandfathers; and&#xD;
there were the representatives of the pure Ameri-&#xD;
can aristocracy, whose honest plebeian ancestors&#xD;
probably would not care-to know them could they&#xD;
return again upon earth; and there wasone person-&#xD;
age, who claimed to be a direct descendant of&#xD;
Attila the Scourge, and carried with him continual-&#xD;
ly a written genealogy to prove it, which was&#xD;
quite unnecessary,&#xD;
The morning saunter was succeeded by the af-&#xD;
ternoon drive, and if the day wasdelightful, what&#xD;
was the evening ? All, youth, middle-age and an-&#xD;
tiquity, assembled in the ball-room to intensify&#xD;
each other's delights. The light forms moving in&#xD;
&#xD;
94&#xD;
&#xD;
the graceful intricacies of the quadrille and ]an-&#xD;
guishing upon the manly shoulder in the fairy&#xD;
waltz, constituted an exquisite spectacle, while&#xD;
other forms languishing against the wall, were in-&#xD;
teresting spectacles also. In the moonlight upon&#xD;
the balcony, while music swelled from within,&#xD;
were the whispering in corners, the fond gaze,&#xD;
the palpitating heart, the stolen kiss, or else the&#xD;
abrupt intrusion of parental jealousy "afraid of&#xD;
the night air," or malignant envy, afraid of&#xD;
nothing.&#xD;
Moses contracted many new friendships and&#xD;
renewed some old ones. At dinner, upon the first&#xD;
day of his arrival, while Mr. Titman was being im-&#xD;
pressed with the thrilling ceremony of uncovering&#xD;
the soup, to the Soldiers' Chorus in Faust, and&#xD;
was staring in stupefaction at the gorgeous negro&#xD;
head waiter, adorned with diamond ear-rings;&#xD;
and while he himself was glancing over the blaze&#xD;
of elegance at the tables, our hero observed Mr.&#xD;
Pinksitt, the artist, with whom he became ac-&#xD;
quainted at the Evereroft, and who at once&#xD;
pleasantly recognized him. Avery fresh-looking&#xD;
young lady was seated with the painter, to whom&#xD;
he seemed to be devoting his smiles and atten-&#xD;
tion, and also a staid elderly gentleman, appar-&#xD;
entiv her father, who was devoting his amIles to&#xD;
the bird before him. After dinner, the painter&#xD;
joined Moses, and informed him that he had been&#xD;
in the country the most of the time since he had&#xD;
left the Evercroft, at a village on Long Island,&#xD;
getting up some marine things.&#xD;
" Ah I and our friend Captain Grimble and his&#xD;
wife ?" asked Moses in a low voice, for his&#xD;
thoughts involuntarily reverted to that eccentric&#xD;
fire-junk, and tender. "Have you seen them&#xD;
frequently ?"&#xD;
"No, no," replied Mr. Pinksitt with a sudden&#xD;
frown, and a nervous tug at his artistic beard.&#xD;
He certainly had something to reveal to Moses,&#xD;
but hesitated, and Moses, observing his agitation,&#xD;
delicately refrained from pursuing the blithesome&#xD;
subject.&#xD;
"By the way, I.have some friends here from&#xD;
Quogue. You saw them with me at dinner,"&#xD;
presently resumed the artist, recovering from his&#xD;
abstraction. "I would like to introduce you."&#xD;
" I should be very happy," replied Moses.&#xD;
"She has retired just now to take a nap, or&#xD;
what is as refreshing to ladies, you know, to havo&#xD;
a talk with some female friend."&#xD;
The next forenoon Moses expended in the so-&#xD;
ciety of the young lady, when he soon observed&#xD;
that she looked upon the rising sun of modern&#xD;
painting with much favor, and seemed to allude&#xD;
to the marine views with even a semi-prop' ictary&#xD;
air. He saw this with gratification. He was&#xD;
pleased to observe it, as an evidence of the art-&#xD;
ist's emancipation from his previous relations.&#xD;
In the course of two or three days, Moses re-&#xD;
ceived a letter from New-York, directed in a&#xD;
lady's hand. Upon opening it, he discovered it&#xD;
was but an envelope, containing an epistle ad-&#xD;
dressed to Mr. Pinksitt, and in some astonishment&#xD;
thereat, he at once took the inclosure to the lat-&#xD;
ter. The artist opened it, read it, and at once&#xD;
manifested some intention of speedily reducing&#xD;
himself to the necessity of wearing a wig.&#xD;
" This is too much, Winkfield. I manage to&#xD;
keep her away, but she will continue to send me&#xD;
these protestations of love I" said he with a look&#xD;
of despair.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"Who?    Is it from Mrs. Grimble ?" asked&#xD;
Moses. "And what on earth did she send it to&#xD;
me for?"&#xD;
" Excuse me, Winkfield, but I took the liberty.&#xD;
You know Saratora is a dreadful place for gossip,&#xD;
and I fear to receive even a newspaper from her'&#xD;
here. I took the liberty, as she will write, to&#xD;
have her address her notes to you during ,rthe&#xD;
short period of the season here."&#xD;
" But I-"&#xD;
" You know you alone are acquainted with my&#xD;
relations with her; and my dear Winkfield, I can&#xD;
confide in you, and in no-one else."&#xD;
" That is very true, but still is not this arrange-&#xD;
meat a little too-"1&#xD;
mt1tlEhe? You do not, like it? I will have it&#xD;
stopped. I'll have it stopped at once !" replied&#xD;
the artist disappointedly.&#xD;
" Oh! no, no !" exclaimed Moses, overcoming his&#xD;
slight dissatisfaction, upon observing the infesti-&#xD;
vity of the other's appearance.&#xD;
The artist here became more melancholy than&#xD;
ever; and fell into little fits of stupor, from which&#xD;
it seemed difficult to arouse him.&#xD;
" Aboy l" answered he, as Moses started him&#xD;
for the fifth time, probably from dreams of Capt.&#xD;
Grimble and others. "Yes, Winkfield, it is of&#xD;
no use, she will not give me up. She would die&#xD;
rather than see  e marry ."&#xD;
" This is really a terrible position to be placed&#xD;
in," said Moses i sympathy. . "It is the conse-&#xD;
quence of allowing our temporary inclination to&#xD;
overcome.our sense of habitual duty."&#xD;
This philosophical reflection did not appear to&#xD;
comfort the distracted artist very much, for he&#xD;
answered: "But she-she patronized me in my&#xD;
profession. She was the first who did. She&#xD;
loved rue, and the worst of it was, I thought I&#xD;
did her. And I can not be an ingrate, Winkfield,&#xD;
I can not be an ingrate !"&#xD;
"Ingrate!" exclaimed Moses. "Why, what&#xD;
are you groiiig to do ?&#xD;
She wants me to wait until her husband is&#xD;
dead," replied Mr. Pinksitt.  " He has had a&#xD;
slight touch of apoplexy since you saw im-en.&#xD;
raged at his cook!l"&#xD;
"But  in not right in assuming, Mr. Pink.&#xD;
sitt, that another-that Miss Tucking-"&#xD;
" Yes, Winkfield, it is she only whom I love&#xD;
or can ever love !" exclaimed the artist passion.&#xD;
ately. "And let this dear girl once know that&#xD;
I have been so basely capable of deceiving&#xD;
another, as I have Josephinie-let Agnes and hei&#xD;
father know that I have been so weak-as to leti&#xD;
myself to Mrs. Grimble's penchant, and I am lost&#xD;
The sole hope of my life is lost!"&#xD;
"And let Capt. Grimble know it," though&#xD;
Moses, " and it would not make much difference&#xD;
whether you had any hopes or not&#xD;
"Josephine-that is, Mrs. Grimble-is in en.&#xD;
tire ignorance of even my acqutaitaiceship witi&#xD;
Miss Tucking. And it is my present object t&#xD;
keep her so, Winhfield; that is until-until-&#xD;
I'm distracted-at any rate for the present."&#xD;
"You are quite right. You have freed your&#xD;
self, and you are now authorized to take an,&#xD;
measures to emancipate her too from this infatr&#xD;
ation,"replied Moses vehemently.&#xD;
The next day he again visited the artist's roor&#xD;
for the purpose of encouraging him in his effort&#xD;
to free himself fiom the improper ecuiimstaiice&#xD;
which had so long surrounded him. Miss Tucli&#xD;
&#xD;
ing and her father were there. The young lady&#xD;
was merrily romping with her lover, and the&#xD;
father was complaisantly looking on with the oc-&#xD;
casional feint of t little parental expostulation&#xD;
thereat.&#xD;
"Ah Mr. Winkfield! you are just in time. Have&#xD;
an ice, do ! We have just had ours up," said the&#xD;
artist,&#xD;
The young lady had stopped her liveliness to&#xD;
salute Moses, and apparently feeling it necessary&#xD;
to subside gracefully to the decorum of acquaint-&#xD;
anceship, pretended to pick the pocket of Mr.&#xD;
Pinksitt's professional dressing-gown hanging over&#xD;
his traveling easel. Noticing a piece of paper&#xD;
beneath the easel, she picked it up, however, and&#xD;
exclaimed: " Oh!1 what a dear little note in buff&#xD;
and blue! May I read it, Edmund ?"&#xD;
" No, noy" said the latter, hastily attempting&#xD;
to snatch it from her. Taking his act as a lover's&#xD;
trifling, she alternately held the note in triumph&#xD;
from his reach, and read aloud therefrom, by,&#xD;
snatches, the following remarkable words:&#xD;
" Dear friend, I am sick of my husband. He&#xD;
grows worse and worse. He pulled the cook's&#xD;
nose again this morning and is unbearable. But&#xD;
your love, my dear friend, sustains amid these&#xD;
trials, one who should have been&#xD;
Your own JOSEPHINE.'&#xD;
&#xD;
"Sick of her husband t Your own Josephine l"&#xD;
repeated the innocent young lady, turning pale&#xD;
and sinking into a chair. " 0 father! give this&#xD;
horrid note, written in ugly blue ink, to-Mr.&#xD;
]Vinksitt ! P.&#xD;
"No, not to me !" exclaimed the latter, in his&#xD;
agitation, still permitting the note to lie upon the&#xD;
carpet, whither it had dropped from the discom-&#xD;
posed young lady's hand. He cast an appealing&#xD;
look at Moses, undoubtedly indicating that he&#xD;
would-be pleased with a very peculiar piece of&#xD;
friendship on our hero's part.&#xD;
" To whom, then ?" asked Mr. Tucking, picking&#xD;
up the note, with the air of a man.afraid of infec-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"oTo-to Mr. Winkfield !" replied his proposed&#xD;
son-in-law, hesitating.&#xD;
" Really, I do not know if it belongs to him,"&#xD;
said the Quogue country gentleman, with polar&#xD;
severity.&#xD;
" Ohs! yes, I assure you !* See the accompany-&#xD;
ing address. It's in the same handwriting and&#xD;
to Mr. Winkfield," said the willingly conmunica-&#xD;
tive artist, rushing to the table and taking up the&#xD;
wrapper, which Moses had left with the letter.&#xD;
The young lady uttered an exclamation of joy&#xD;
and followed to the window 1er father, who was&#xD;
suspiciously examinin'g the envelope, at arma's&#xD;
length through his eye-glass.&#xD;
"But, my dear, sir !" whispered the astounded&#xD;
Moses to Pinksitt.&#xD;
"For God's sake, say nothing now !" replied the&#xD;
latter.&#xD;
.It is true," said Mr. Tuekinc who had finished&#xD;
his quarantine examination, and approached Mo-&#xD;
ses. "Itis yours, sir, and I beg pardon for my&#xD;
delay in giving it to you, sir."&#xD;
Gracious heaven my dear sir- "c      e&#xD;
Moses, bewilderedly holding the note.&#xD;
"You will excuse us for havingaccidentally&#xD;
discovered that which had better have been never&#xD;
.known," said the paterfamilias, still continuing&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
his pleasing attempt to freeze Moses ; or perhaps&#xD;
never have bee'r  Never have been, sir 1"&#xD;
" But, sir-!"interposed Moses again excitedly&#xD;
"Fie, sir, fie I" said the gentleman, now trying&#xD;
the warm treatment of shaming Moses into a&#xD;
sense of propriety. "But pardon us, sir, pardon&#xD;
us. We still must feel it is a humiliating secret,&#xD;
which is properly your own, sir !"&#xD;
Moses was in terrible discomfiture. Hie felt his&#xD;
hair standing upon end.&#xD;
" My daughter and I are about taking a little&#xD;
walk in the park. Meantime we hope, Mr. Pink-&#xD;
sitt, you will endeavor to assure your friend for&#xD;
us, that we have been very unwillingly intrusted&#xD;
with this objectionable knowledge," continued the&#xD;
Long Island parent pompously. "Good day, sir,&#xD;
good day, Mr. Winkfield."'&#xD;
Moses made a wild attempt to rush after them,&#xD;
but was restrained by the excited artist.&#xD;
" What are you going to do ?" asked the latter.&#xD;
" To disabuse their minds !" replied Moses hasti-&#xD;
ly, " to-",&#xD;
" What? Why, think, what you do to me !"&#xD;
" But this gentleman is a man of few words, and&#xD;
has had an impression of my character which-&#xD;
which-"&#xD;
"Oh ! pray rest easy, Winkfield. You are not&#xD;
placed as I am !" implored the artist.&#xD;
" But Iam!" said Moses, in renewed excitement.&#xD;
I have a friend in New-York, who-dear me, if&#xD;
she were to -hear-"&#xD;
" But she is not here !" continued the artist dis.&#xD;
tractedly. "What does it amount to, that Ag-&#xD;
nes and her father, who are comparative strangers&#xD;
to you, should imagine that you-"&#xD;
"But heavens! They imagine what is not so!&#xD;
What is not true !" said Moses vehemently.&#xD;
" They will never say any thing about it: They&#xD;
are people of honor, and, my dear friend, you will&#xD;
save me and my life and her's-Josephine s, by&#xD;
heaven, think of it !"&#xD;
The appeal became too great for Moses's feel-&#xD;
ingrs. He gave up his designa of following Mr.&#xD;
Taking and daughter, and presently left the grate-&#xD;
ful artist and went to his. own lodgings.&#xD;
"1 Pretty business!" ejaculated he on the way.&#xD;
However, keep quiet and -nothing will be known&#xD;
about it. He must certainly be assisted in his&#xD;
difficulties."&#xD;
But to increase those difficulties, to augment&#xD;
Moses's misgivings and add to the interest of the&#xD;
situation, Mrs. Grimble, accompanied by her ep-&#xD;
centric lord, arrived that afternoon. Moses was&#xD;
conjured by the agitated artist to screen his posi-&#xD;
tion from her observation, and introduced to her.&#xD;
After a short but comprehensive estimate of her&#xD;
peculiar character, Moses firmly concluded that a&#xD;
discovery, by this mercurial female, of the artist's&#xD;
relations with Miss Tucking would be hazardous&#xD;
of a volcanic explosion, in which some of the&#xD;
dibris might perchance be scattered over him.&#xD;
But as fortune had made him the sole depository&#xD;
of the disagreeable secret, and he seemed the&#xD;
only one who might assist the unhappy artist, he&#xD;
resolved to continue the exercise of his benevo-&#xD;
lence toward the latter, consistently, of course,&#xD;
with the obligation.to himself of preserving his&#xD;
own moral and physical system  intact therein.&#xD;
lie, therefore, at once artfully endeavored to per-&#xD;
SUade Captain Grimble to leave the watering-&#xD;
place, although it was but the day after the latter&#xD;
arrived-.&#xD;
&#xD;
h "There IYou see mywife, Winkficld," sald&#xD;
the marine, who was somewhat irritated at a vio-&#xD;
lent snubbing he had jdst received from his wife.&#xD;
" What do you think of her? She let's me decide,&#xD;
you see. The point being always, whether I shall&#xD;
permit her to have her own way or, stand by and&#xD;
see her take it.Peculiar, Isn't she ?" b&#xD;
"Not at all, not at all. The prerogatives of the&#xD;
sex, you know," replied Moses. "By the way,&#xD;
both she and you will enjoy the society here very&#xD;
mafch, I imagine, Captain. It is regarded as a&#xD;
little stupid by some, and I know of one or two&#xD;
who even intend to leave at the very first oppor-&#xD;
tunity, but still, people will find fault everywhere,&#xD;
you know."&#xD;
I didn't want to come at all-Mrs. Grimble&#xD;
again."&#xD;
"At any rate, Captain, if nothing better, while&#xD;
you are here, you can occupy your time very&#xD;
beneficially in going through a course of the water&#xD;
medically. Dieting, keeping yourself in your room&#xD;
most of the time, you know, and taking your out-&#xD;
door exercise regularly. I advise you to; as an&#xD;
invalid, you couldn't do better,"&#xD;
"D-n it! I can do that at heme !"&#xD;
TIt would perhaps be better at your house.&#xD;
The water is better bottled; and, surrounded with&#xD;
domestic comforts, it would certainly be much&#xD;
better if you went through the course in your own&#xD;
house."&#xD;
o Failing to persuade the gallant captain to fol-&#xD;
low this beneficial advice, Moses resorted to other&#xD;
maneuvers for the generous purpose of segregating&#xD;
that gentleman and his wife as much as possible&#xD;
from contact with Mr. Pinksitt. So assiduons&#xD;
and constant did he become in paying his court&#xD;
to Mrs. Grimble, so profusely complimentary, so&#xD;
eager in the offer of his services to her, that one&#xD;
day, when at the well with her lord, he thought&#xD;
he detected an inclination upon the part of that&#xD;
gentleman to throw a glass goblet at his head,&#xD;
and on another, he discovered him taking hdeliber-&#xD;
ate aim at him with his forefinger, as if lie were&#xD;
imagining it a first-quality dueling-pistol.&#xD;
Confound this marine monomaniac !" thought&#xD;
Moses. "He can't be getting jealous of me! Good&#xD;
gracious, suppose he should find out that his wife&#xD;
had been addressing notes to me! By heaven, if&#xD;
I were alone here, I shouldebe tempted to go&#xD;
away and get rid of the whole business at once!&#xD;
But no " continued he striking his breast, "I&#xD;
will not dishonorably desert one who has appealed&#xD;
to my aid in his efforts to recover the path of&#xD;
duty. Besides that, I am no doubt mistaken."&#xD;
CHAPTER XLIII.&#xD;
IN WHICH MR. PINKSITT Is IMPRUDENT, MOSES&#xD;
ARTLESS, AND MRS. GIUMBLE TRAn STRONG. A&#xD;
LETTER FROM MR. DIFFICULTY,&#xD;
UPoN an island of the neighboring lake, short-&#xD;
ly after Mr. and Mrs. Grimble's arrival, there took&#xD;
place from the hotel a picnic, which Moses looked&#xD;
upon as a failure. Firstly, because every body&#xD;
wished to be exclusive and speak to nobody;&#xD;
secondly, because they would not dance, as they&#xD;
had enough of that to do at the hotel; thirdly&#xD;
because they could not fish, as there were no&#xD;
fhin e lk; fourthl, because there seemed&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7256-00000050"/>&#xD;
98&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WIN&#xD;
&#xD;
nothing to be done, except to eat the luncheon&#xD;
and look at the scenery, both of which were very&#xD;
uninteresting; and fifthly, because Mr. Toplady&#xD;
was shot quite severely in the leg, in an attempt&#xD;
at archery, gotten up among the ladies toward&#xD;
the close.&#xD;
Mr. Barnard had done his best to rescue the&#xD;
assembly from their dejection. He had proposed&#xD;
for that purpose, early in the proceedings, that&#xD;
the banquet should be spread and eaten, particu-&#xD;
larly, as, owing to the vicissitudes of dissipation,&#xD;
he had only partially breakfasted that morning&#xD;
upon a segar and a glass of Congress water. He&#xD;
had afterward facetiously tied a ferocious bull-&#xD;
frog upon the bosom of a gentleman who had re-&#xD;
sorted to the oblivion of slumber for relief, col-&#xD;
laterally securing in either hand a garden toad,&#xD;
and then awakened him with a shower of grass-&#xD;
hoppers. But even this and other little speci-&#xD;
pens of the young gentleman's liveliness failed&#xD;
to be inspiring. The only funny thing which ap-&#xD;
peared to be appreciated during the whole of the&#xD;
performance was an attempt upon the part of Mr.&#xD;
Titman to sing a serious song. Captain Grimble's&#xD;
knowledge of aquatic matters had been called&#xD;
into requisition, and he had been carried to the&#xD;
picnic, not unwillingly, for his wife had sprained&#xD;
her foot on the morning of its occurrence, and&#xD;
shown savage symptoms of megrims in conse-&#xD;
quence of thesaccident. She had been covertly&#xD;
promised the society of Mr. Pinksitt during her&#xD;
lord's absence, and perhaps it was chiefly from&#xD;
the painter's infatuation in neglecting her to ac-&#xD;
company Miss Tucking to the festivity, that Moses&#xD;
felt it to have been a failure.&#xD;
When the hour for returning came, the foolish&#xD;
artist contemplated the possible insalubrity of this&#xD;
step. It then suddenly struck him that her sus-&#xD;
picions might have been aroused by it, that she&#xD;
even might be very uncomfortably awaiting his&#xD;
return to the hotel, with wrath enough in her re-&#xD;
flections to create a serious scene.  Oppressed&#xD;
with this unpleasant idea, he confessed his delin&#xD;
quency to Moses, and induced him to proceed&#xD;
ahead as scout, with the agreement to follow him&#xD;
and tarry at the wells to await any threatening&#xD;
intelligence he might procure. Again inspired&#xD;
with the rectitude of the cause, Moses at once&#xD;
generously set out for the hotel, and, there pro&#xD;
ceeded to virtuously sneak about the premises in&#xD;
cautious search of Mrs. Grimble's presence. Shi&#xD;
was not in her parlor, but he presently found he'&#xD;
at a hall window near the artist's apartments&#xD;
She had been reading there a book which appar&#xD;
ently disagreed with her; so much so, that th&#xD;
hall waiter had removed his station to the othe&#xD;
end of the passage, in alarm at her irritated start&#xD;
and impatient expressions. She started again a&#xD;
seeing Moses, but immediately recovered herself&#xD;
and smiled with extraordinary sweetness upo&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Waiter, take this book to my apartment. S&#xD;
you have" returned from the picnic, Mr. Wink&#xD;
field. Where are your friends ?" said she&#xD;
"1Where is Mr. Pinksitt?  He was there, o&#xD;
course."&#xD;
There were here some symptoms of ferocit&#xD;
at the mention of Mr. Pinksitt's name ; but Mose&#xD;
was glad to attribute them ,to her unpleasant&#xD;
ankle, for she immediately smiled again sweetly&#xD;
ad Rad:-&#xD;
"Mr. Winkfleld, I am charmed with your b&#xD;

&#xD;
to devote himself to tiiefestivity. Moving here&#xD;
and there in the illuminated hall, amid the love-&#xD;
liness and grace of its occupants, or sustaining&#xD;
some exquisite form in the various dances there-&#xD;
in, or listening in delighted benignity to the low&#xD;
gentle-oice of his partner in some cool alcove.&#xD;
His friends apparently shared with him the plea-&#xD;
sure of the evening. At its commencement, Mr.&#xD;
Titiman was honored with the society of a young&#xD;
lady, who endeavored to impress him with a no-&#xD;
tion of her refinement by an intense demonstra-&#xD;
tion of frigidity; but, notwithstanding this and&#xD;
the physical effect therefrom of catching a slight&#xD;
cold and sneezing once or twice, he was enabled&#xD;
to continue his hilarity until an extremely late&#xD;
hour, when he was forced to his lodgings by&#xD;
three waiters under the command of Mr. Barnard.&#xD;
When Mr. Toplady retired, he judiciously fol-&#xD;
lowed up the'business fidelity with which he had&#xD;
attended to his terpsichorean duties, by rubbing&#xD;
his limbs with brandy, and Mr. Barnard followed&#xD;
his by applying the same internally. As for our&#xD;
hero himself, the graceful manner in which he&#xD;
performed various redowas, varsoviennes, etc.,&#xD;
called forth the admiration of numerous young&#xD;
ladies; and even the accident of being thrown in&#xD;
a sitting position upon an old lady's lap, caused&#xD;
by the enthusiastic rapidity of a waltz, which he&#xD;
had executed with a congenial young lady, was&#xD;
passed over by the ancient gentlewoman herself&#xD;
with but a sriort or two of momentary indigna-&#xD;
tion, owing to his affable bearing. And he con-&#xD;
tinued his efforts until he and the lights were&#xD;
fairly put out.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLV.&#xD;
CULMINATION OF MOSES'S RELATIONS WITH CAPT.&#xD;
GRtIMBLE.&#xD;
NEXT morning Moses, in returning from his&#xD;
customary morning walk, found Mr. Titman at&#xD;
breakfast, in company with Mr. Toplady, Mr.&#xD;
Barnard, and a party of fashionable young gentle-&#xD;
men, whom he was convulsing with the wit which&#xD;
he had imbibed from the negro minstrels during&#xD;
his brief stay in New-York, and which was ren-&#xD;
dered sufficiently original, by his affecting it to&#xD;
be so, to make it highly pleasing. After gener-&#xD;
ously doing his share of applauding these affable&#xD;
efforts of the little gentleman, Moses repaired to&#xD;
the balcony with Mr. Barnard. He was there&#xD;
presently caught by a party of interesting young&#xD;
ladies, and pressed into their service as reader of&#xD;
the new poem by Tennyson, whereupon Mr.&#xD;
Barnard, leaving him with the decided, conclu-&#xD;
sion that he was very amiable, sought Mr. Top-&#xD;
lady's society in a game of bowls.&#xD;
As Moses now and then endeavored to render&#xD;
the intenser passages of the poet with dramatic&#xD;
force, and lifted his sonorous voice or lowered it&#xD;
to the still whisper, many were the looks of ad.&#xD;
mira'tion and even tenderness cast upon him and&#xD;
his poetic absorption. There were some unavoid-&#xD;
able interruptions by necessary remarks among&#xD;
the young ladies, respecting their crotchet work,&#xD;
such as, " Yes. T wo loops ; then a cross stitch !&#xD;
1, 2, 3, 4. Return and fill up interstices. 1, 2, 3,&#xD;
4. Then reverse," etc. And also an idiotic poo-&#xD;
dle instinctively felt it his duty to bark violently&#xD;

whenever Moses raisedais arm to point the fin- f&#xD;
ger of scorn, or make the lover s- appeal to s&#xD;
;heaven. But otherwise his auditors  vere deeply I&#xD;
delighted, and he would have come off without a f&#xD;
mar to his own pleasure, if he had not felt forced a&#xD;
to correct an innocent Laura Matilda who per- I&#xD;
sisted in pointing out the flattest commonplaces t&#xD;
of the book as exquisite gems, merely because the t&#xD;
Sentences commenced .the wrong end foremost.e&#xD;
After philosophically attempting to show that&#xD;
true poetry consisted neither in exhibiting a sen- t&#xD;
sible man in motley, nor a fool in plain dress, he I&#xD;
left to wander about the park, and presently pro- 1&#xD;
ceeded to his own room. It was a commodious i&#xD;
front-parlor with a back bed-room, upon the first a&#xD;
floor, in a pleasant cottage surrounded with a&#xD;
garden of trees.&#xD;
He opened the door of his parlor. "Good I&#xD;
gracious !" exclaimed he.&#xD;
His friend, the artist,- was agitatedly pacing I&#xD;
across the room, and Mrs. Grimble was, seated i&#xD;
upon the sofa, pulling her handkerchief in equal'&#xD;
agitation. The fact of his parlor being made the f&#xD;
place of interview may have caused him some(&#xD;
alarm, but it was that of there being any interview&#xD;
at all, and particularly it  agitated appearanceI&#xD;
which caused him to inwardly exclaim, " Thist&#xD;
eternal affair!  I knew it   She's changed her&#xD;
mind againI"                              .(&#xD;
" My dear sir," continued he, with a frown, to&#xD;
the artist who approached him to explain; t&#xD;
" why, why have you been weak enough to-"  t&#xD;
" My dear Winkfield," interrupted the artist,&#xD;
"excuse my liberty, for1it was necessary, such a&#xD;
have become Captain Grimble's suspicions-and a&#xD;
she insisted on the interview and-I thought we'd&#xD;
better agree to meet once more.  She's just&#xD;
come, and every thing as yet is-well, in point ofI&#xD;
fact, somewhat unsettled,'but-"I&#xD;
" Madam!V" said our hero energetically, turn-&#xD;
ing to the lady. "You are no doubt aware of t&#xD;
my having become involuntarily a confident of&#xD;
your unhappy secret, entirely involuntarily, andI&#xD;
it is in fact extremely disagreeable to me, but&#xD;
allow me as a confident to advise, warn, nay, i&#xD;
entreat you, both of you, unhappy beings, to(&#xD;
summon up your courage, to fortify your duty to f&#xD;
yourselves and to society, and conquer this ter-&#xD;
rible attachment, which however pardonable in I&#xD;
its commencement, is still leading to consequen-&#xD;
ces which may be truly regarded by every en-&#xD;
lightened Christian and conservative upholder of I&#xD;
the conventionalities of society as no more nor&#xD;
less than-awful !"&#xD;
Now this oration was all very pretty, highly 1&#xD;
applicable, and creditable to the moral impulses&#xD;
of our hero, but we are inclined to believe if he(&#xD;
had known the proceedings which were taking I&#xD;
place outside at the very moment of its delivery,(&#xD;
he would have refrained altogether from it, and&#xD;
confined his words to a simple exhortation toE&#xD;
thenm to leave his apartment instantly. But he 1&#xD;
did not know that Captain Grimble's sufferings&#xD;
had so increased, in consequence of his wife's&#xD;
extraordinary number of headaches, ferocity and i&#xD;
erratic conduct generally, as to induce that wor-&#xD;
thy but sensitive gentleman to attempt to dis-&#xD;
cover the cause by employing several emissaries&#xD;
in the shape of numerous small boys to watch&#xD;
the motions of his willful lady, not daring to do&#xD;
so himself. He further was not aware that one I&#xD;

fore, had returned to the captain at the hotel&#xD;
table with the interesting information that the&#xD;
ady had turned down into the yard of Mr. Wink.&#xD;
ield's lodgings, and, in fact, entered the same in&#xD;
an easy and graceful manner. But luckily, as&#xD;
he paused and delicately looked out of one of&#xD;
he parlor-windows, that his remarks might have&#xD;
heir effect unwitnessed by him, he espied the&#xD;
excited captain, who had knocked down the boy&#xD;
and started for the cottage, now tearing through&#xD;
he front-gate and toward the house. With that&#xD;
presence of mind which marks a vigorous intel.&#xD;
ect, and one equal to cases of extreme and per.&#xD;
lous necessity, Moses bounded to the parlor-door&#xD;
and locked it. The next moment he wisely ex-&#xD;
pended in revealing the coming danger to the&#xD;
lady and her unhappy affinity, the next in bund-&#xD;
ling them together into the back chamber, and&#xD;
pointing breathlessly to a door leading out there-&#xD;
from into the rear of the garden, and the next&#xD;
in seizing from the centre-table a copy of that in-&#xD;
teresting monthly, Godey's Lady's Book, and thus&#xD;
fraudulently. but grandly awaiting events. The&#xD;
captain rushed into the hall of the cottage, and&#xD;
violently seized the first door-handle he met with.&#xD;
It was that of Moses's apartment. The latter&#xD;
arose, book in hand, and opened it. ___&#xD;
"My wife I my wife! Mrs. Grimble l" ex-&#xD;
claimed the captain, tearing past Moses into the&#xD;
room and insanely looking beneath the sofa and&#xD;
table, upon the mantel-piece, and pulling the&#xD;
chairs about.;&#xD;
"Eh? eh, sir ? Captain, what means this-this&#xD;
abruptness ?" asked the pale Moses, heroically&#xD;
summoning all -his power. "What means this&#xD;
intrusion, sir ?" -&#xD;
"You needn't attempt subterfuge, young man.&#xD;
My wife, Mrs. Grimble. Is that woman here ?'"&#xD;
roared the captain ferociously.&#xD;
"Your wife, Mrs. Grimble, here P" replied the&#xD;
trembling Moses and feigning a mixture of indig-&#xD;
nation and surprise. "Don't you see she is not&#xD;
here? Don't you see it?"&#xD;
"Yes. I see she is not here. And what is&#xD;
more, young man, I see-a handkerchief-a la-&#xD;
dy's handkerchief !" cried the captain, darting&#xD;
at an object upon the sofa, and examining it. "If&#xD;

For a short moment Moses stared idiotically at&#xD;
the unfortunate article of apparel, disordered,&#xD;
and left by the lady in her recent agitation upon&#xD;
the sofa. He then instinctively backed toward&#xD;
the bed-room door to escape by that egress. He&#xD;
could not. The artist had taken the hasty pre.&#xD;
caution to lock that too in his flight. The cap-&#xD;
tain drew a glittering blade, which, whether his&#xD;
own or borrowed, amply answered all require-&#xD;
ments. The chase around the centre-table was a&#xD;
short one. At the fourth heat Mr. Winkfield&#xD;
turned abruptly upon his pursuer. With one&#xD;
elevating blow which he succeeded in placing&#xD;
aider the proboscis of the latter, he knocked&#xD;
that less agile antagonist into the fire-place atid&#xD;
a state of insensibility, and escaping by the front.-&#xD;
door, fled for the apartment of his nearest friend&#xD;
and sole relative, Mr. Toplady,.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XLVI.&#xD;
MR. PINKSITT UNDERTAKEs TO DISCHARGE SEVERAL&#xD;
BUSINESS MATTERS FOR THE JOINT ACCOUNT OF&#xD;
GaIMsLE, WINKFIELD, AND SELF.&#xD;
Ma. ToPLADY was not in. Our hero rushed&#xD;
into -the hall again, where he came in contact&#xD;
with the equally fermented Pinksitt.&#xD;
"She is afe in her own room. We escaped&#xD;
without being observed by any one I" whispered&#xD;
that agitated gentleman.&#xD;
"But, good heaven, I didn't !" replied Mr.&#xD;
Winkfield breathlessly. "Pinksitt, I must leave.&#xD;
I must leave town at once. Ha suspected and&#xD;
attacked me. I defended myself, and knocked&#xD;
hin down, but he'll be here presently, and good&#xD;
heaven, I must leave, to avoid a public exposure&#xD;
of the matter, if-nothing else! Adieu. Protect&#xD;
my honor, bring me word to Plumville, and keep&#xD;
my destination a secret from every one-,even&#xD;
my friends !"&#xD;
The directions were extremely hasty, but they&#xD;
were sufficient, and in less than an half-hour our&#xD;
hero, fitisihing his third mile toward Plumville,&#xD;
sat down ont a rock in a hidden wood at the side&#xD;
of the road, to recover his physical energies and&#xD;
momentarily contemplate the extraordinary diffi-&#xD;
culties into which he had been so unexpectedly&#xD;
plunged.&#xD;
We observed that by his promptness of action&#xD;
in the late contest, his terribly excited antago-&#xD;
nist had been knocked insensible; we may ob-&#xD;
serve that he was in a measure knocked sensible&#xD;
also, for upon recovering, instead of the impiil-&#xD;
sive vengeance which he had thus attempted to&#xD;
scekl, he resolved at once upon the systematic.&#xD;
plan of satisfaction usual im such cases. Yes,&#xD;
he started for his hotel- there avoiding every&#xD;
one as well as he could in his rage, he at once&#xD;
paid his bills, calmly informed his now thorough.&#xD;
ly alarmed wife that she must pack up at once;&#xD;
and about the time that Moses reached Plum-&#xD;
ville on the north he and the other half of his&#xD;
ungracious establishment had reached the Spa on&#xD;
the south. From this latter place he failed not&#xD;
ere he retired to his restless couch to indite a&#xD;
dreadful challenge to our hero, and inclosing it&#xD;
in an epistle to Mr. Pinksitt with a brief state-&#xD;
ment of his grievances received at the hands of&#xD;
this vile.scoundrel and- bloody pirate, Winkfield,&#xD;
requested him to undertake the task, peculiarly&#xD;
restorative to the unhappy artist no doubt, of&#xD;
becomnig his second. What were the latter&#xD;
feelings ?  With restless paces in his room he&#xD;
waited for the light to break, and at early dawn&#xD;
sneaked out of the hotel with the deadly missive,&#xD;
and in a hired gig reached tne tavern at Plum-&#xD;
ville ere the comfort-loving people of that town&#xD;
were yet stirring. As Moses had too well con-&#xD;
jectured, the news he thus received was such as&#xD;
would increase the consternation and disgust&#xD;
into which; he had already been plunged. The&#xD;
sleepless night was to be succeed by a day of&#xD;
darkness and perhaps-I&#xD;
"But let me calm you. Consider this missiveI&#xD;
of but little account, my dear Winkfield, or that&#xD;
it will be matle so by the step which I am aboutI&#xD;
to take," said the artist, in a voice faltering&#xD;
with despair. '"And now, adieu, my friend,&#xD;
adieu !'-&#xD;
"What step ? Where are you going ? What&#xD;
are you goim5 to do ?" exclimmed Mosea in as-&#xD;
&#xD;
tonishment at these words and the manner of&#xD;
the other.&#xD;
Can I hesitate without being an infamous&#xD;
wretch?" replied the artist. "Is it not for me,&#xD;
for me that your life has already been endan-&#xD;
gered ? Is it not for me I'hat she, infatuated as&#xD;
she is, is about to lose honor, fortune, and rep-&#xD;
utation at the hands of her injured husband ? Is&#xD;
it not by me that he, a gentleman of honor and&#xD;
gallant marine, has been injured and outraged ?"&#xD;
"Oh ! do not feel so guilty !" cried Moses,&#xD;
with emotion, "for you are not, are you ?"&#xD;
1"And to-morrow without doubt you would-yes,&#xD;
it is right. My existence belongs to Josephine, and&#xD;
I will offer it to her-my honor to you, and I&#xD;
will sacrifice it for your safety. Either stay and&#xD;
avow all, if she be already repelled by her hus-&#xD;
band, and receive at his hands the fatal punish-&#xD;
ment which I merit, or fly with her to some&#xD;
strange country, there to linger in wretched ob-&#xD;
scurity and endeavor to atone for the folly into&#xD;
which we have been inadvertently drawn P"&#xD;
"Silence !" cried Moses convulsively. " That&#xD;
is, be calm. Let us endeavor to preserve our&#xD;
equanimity at this terrible moment. You can&#xD;
do neither the one nor the other. Either step&#xD;
would be to the lady'  dishonor, and besides that,&#xD;
you haven't money enough to fly with!&#xD;
"No ! my friend !' said the artist despondent.&#xD;
ly. "But what matters lucre in a case where&#xD;
honor and character are in question ?"&#xD;
"I would lend you some," said Moses forget-&#xD;
fully. "But no, no! never, never! Listen to&#xD;
me. The fatal attachment between you and this&#xD;
wretched female is not what has been discovered&#xD;
at all. It is I the captain suspects I To clear&#xD;
myself I would have to betray both you and his&#xD;
wife, unless I could sit down and calmly reason&#xD;
with him on his absurd suspicion of me. I'll sit&#xD;
down and reason with him, Pinksitt !"&#xD;
" But he will not listen to reason. Good God!&#xD;
I know him too well!"&#xD;
* Eh 2" said Moses in concern, starting up in&#xD;
bed.&#xD;
"Never !"&#xD;
"Then he deserves to be shot, and I will fight&#xD;
him I I am opposed to duels, but I will fight&#xD;
this one !" exclaimed Moses, striking the pillow&#xD;
beside iivn with a tremendous blow. "Besides&#xD;
that, there is no alternative. I must, by heaven !"&#xD;
To say he did not feel it was possible that an&#xD;
encounter might not be necessary, would be de-&#xD;
nying him the ordinary porptions of humanity.&#xD;
But still as he had no exact notion as to how it&#xD;
could be avoided, we must accord much admi-&#xD;
ration to the magnanimity of his decision. The&#xD;
artist was overcome.&#xD;
"My friend I my dear Winkfield I" said he,&#xD;
rising desperately. "The time is elapsing. I&#xD;
must leave you. I will see that you are protect.&#xD;
ed in this matter, as your disinterestedness de-&#xD;
serves. It shall not be said that such friendship&#xD;
as yours will be unremembered by me !"&#xD;
He tore himself with a fervent embrace from&#xD;
the magnanimous Moses, who had been suddenly&#xD;
struck with the premonition that he was going to&#xD;
feel very disagreeable. The next forenoon, the&#xD;
artist was returning to Saratoga from a pleasant&#xD;
visit to the dire Captain Grimble at Blallston, in&#xD;
which he had been led to believe that all hope of&#xD;
stopping the affair was dissipated. Hie found&#xD;
that by the captain's order, the servants of the&#xD;

He proceeded to select the field, a pasture duty to seek Mr. Toplady at once, and with the&#xD;

The sheriff prudently summoned aposse comitatus&#xD;

office, and the whole party swelled by a volunteer&#xD;
surgeon in the person of the apothecary's appren-&#xD;
tice, and by fourteen loafers from different parts&#xD;
of the village, who somehow had mysteriously&#xD;
obtained wind of the affair, started off in wagons&#xD;
to the place; Mr. Toplady being very nervous,&#xD;
Mr. Titman very cold, and Mr. Barnard very afraid&#xD;
that they would not be in time. The latter had&#xD;
become so irritated at the delay, caused by the&#xD;
prudential measures of the shertff, as to repeat-&#xD;
edly express to that worthy officer, his desire to&#xD;
knock his head off for him. Though how that&#xD;
was going to expedite matters, we leave the read-&#xD;

CHAPTER XLVII.&#xD;
THE LITTLE SETTLEMENTT BETWEEN OUR HERO,&#xD;
CAPTAIN GRIMBLE AND A THIRD PARTY, WHO&#xD;
THRUSTS HIMSELF INTO THE MATTER IN HAND&#xD;
ON HIs OWN ACCOUNT.&#xD;
IT is said that in times of great danger, with&#xD;
the prospect of extermination before a person's&#xD;
discernment, the faculty of memory is unusually&#xD;
active, and even the smallest events of one's pre-&#xD;
vious career, and particularly those of a peaceful&#xD;
and placid nature, are called in rapid succession&#xD;
before the consciousness. As Moses bade, per-&#xD;
haps, a lasting adieu to the quiet town of Plum-&#xD;
ville, and drove along in his solitary ride toward&#xD;
the place of meeting, he remembered many&#xD;
scenes of his previous life, especially of his early&#xD;
childhood, which probably would not have been&#xD;
otherwise easily recalled. The little generous&#xD;
sharing of.molasses candy and peanuts, which had&#xD;
so often delighted his infantile being at school,&#xD;
the applause of his friends at gaining the first&#xD;
prize for spelling, the Saturday holiday visits to&#xD;
the woods in company with Joe, the stable-boy-&#xD;
were among the number of these pleasing recol-&#xD;
lections. Speculations on that mysterious, in-&#xD;
scrutable subject of a future life also filled his&#xD;
mind, and the various perplexing doctrines of&#xD;
Stoics, Peripatetics, Christians, Jews, and Moham-&#xD;
medans, passed in rapid succession. Even the&#xD;
old horse before him shared with him his pen.&#xD;
siveness, and fell into a gloomy meditation upon&#xD;
the rude manner in which he had been torn from&#xD;
his oats, and the unseemly hour at which he was&#xD;
called upon to put his muscles into requisition.&#xD;
At last as our hero turned into-a lonely by-road,&#xD;
according to the directions of the artist, he des-&#xD;
cried that person in front of him awaiting his ap-&#xD;
proach. Every thing had been arranged by the&#xD;
forlorn painterin an adjoining field. The inex-&#xD;
orable captain was there, brim-full of increased&#xD;
wrath, and the most powerful microscope in ex-&#xD;
istence could in vain succeed in revealing the&#xD;
smallest hope of avoiding the conflict. Moses&#xD;
led his horse into an embowered thicket, and&#xD;
tied him. How he envied that honest hackney's&#xD;
lot at that moment I --The prospect of -spending&#xD;
a further day upon this earth, in feeding upon&#xD;
inferior timothy, and being driven thirty miles&#xD;
a day, by unfeeling pleasure-seekers, seemed&#xD;
heaven to him compared with his prospective&#xD;
&#xD;
destiny. He took a furtive moment's opportunity&#xD;
to essay to dissipate the involuntary agitation of&#xD;
his system, and followed the speechless artist 'n&#xD;
silence to the pasture. At one end thereof, near&#xD;
a little hillock, was his dreadful antagonist, walk-&#xD;
ing impatiently up and down, and in An adjoining&#xD;
field at the side, was a bull, who had been&#xD;
roused from his dewy lair, and stood in sleepy as-&#xD;
tonishment collecting his faculties, and gazing at&#xD;
the intrusion. No other specimens of vitality en-&#xD;
livened the scene.&#xD;
" Wha--where's Barnard ? Where is my-&#xD;
friend ?" asked Moses of the artist.&#xD;
" Never mind. He's not necessary. I'll-I'll&#xD;
see to every thing. Every thing will be right I"&#xD;
replied the artist, in much greater agitation than&#xD;
Moses.' "Cheer up. Every thing will be made&#xD;
straight directly. You'll see I"&#xD;
Moses internally agreed with the speaker. He&#xD;
felt confident that something or somebody would&#xD;
be made straight directly, but he did not know&#xD;
whether he would be the one left to see it.&#xD;
"Good GodI That fatal handkerchief!" cried&#xD;
the artist. "He has at last brought out, and is&#xD;
waving the handkerchief she left in your room.&#xD;
Oh! howl hate to see it I The wretch has been in-&#xD;
sanely nursing it in his bosom, as if it were the&#xD;
dearest object of his affections on earth, instead&#xD;
of a badge of shame, as he is going to make it,&#xD;
for himself."&#xD;
"But what is he waving it for?" asked Moses.&#xD;
" He's insane, crazy !" replied the artist. "It is&#xD;
to show that he defies you, thd laws of his country,&#xD;
and his God! The d--d wretch I"&#xD;
The marine was undoubtedly full of the fire&#xD;
of unquenched jealousy, for he still continued to&#xD;
madly toss the unfortunate article of his wife's&#xD;
wardrobe-in the air as our hero advanced into&#xD;
the field. But if he was insane with jealousy,&#xD;
there was another being near him, who had been&#xD;
gradually working himself into a similar state.&#xD;
The rights and prerogatives of feeding in one's&#xD;
own pastures, is one of the fundamental prince.&#xD;
ples of bovine as well as human nature, and&#xD;
moreover, it is just as worthy an object of excit-&#xD;
ing the passions, as the marital rights of the&#xD;
latter. Besides that, bulls don't like to have&#xD;
things waved in the air before them. It obscures&#xD;
their vision, causes a rush of blood to their heads,&#xD;
and a simultaneous rush of the owner of the&#xD;
head, upon the ofending object. With one&#xD;
dreadful snort and bound, lashing his sides in his&#xD;
new fury, the adjacent animal butted down the&#xD;
intervening fence, and charged down directly&#xD;
upon the heedless captain,&#xD;
"Save yourself! Save yourself!" cried our&#xD;
generous hero in alarm, as he observed the terrific&#xD;
bull's tearing pace and corkscrew tail.&#xD;
It was a small field, Moses and the artist&#xD;
threw themselves into the jungle on the side, and&#xD;
turning in hasty agitation, they saw the. bull&#xD;
come in contact with the captain, just as the&#xD;
latter had hurriedly stooped to carry off the case&#xD;
of weapons lying upon the ground near him.&#xD;
He was too late. The case of instruments was&#xD;
knocked from his hands to a distance of twenty&#xD;
feet, and the captain himself was knocked com-&#xD;
pletely over the fence near him into a scrub-bush,&#xD;
leaving the temporary supply of breath he had&#xD;
in the field from which he was so summarily&#xD;
ejected. The bull triumphantly snorted, tossed&#xD;
his horns, and thcn retreated. Moses and Mr.&#xD;

MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
the efforts of these guardians of the peace were&#xD;
only a letsand hindrance to the fireeand enit&#xD;
ened pleasures of the community, and with the&#xD;
intimation that this one had, in improper cu&#xD;
riosity, insinuated his nose into the present affair,&#xD;
he more than once, on the way back, expressed&#xD;
to the indignant officer an extreme desire to pull&#xD;
that particular and well-defined organ of know-&#xD;
ledge for him. By the time they had reached the&#xD;
confines of Saratogra, the irritated gentleman had&#xD;
got to defying the whole posse conitat us, loafers in-&#xD;
cluded, and though( h they rather had the advantage&#xD;
of him in number, there is no doubt he would&#xD;
have commenced summary operations on them, if&#xD;
he had not been prevented by the entreaties and&#xD;
commands of Moses, Mi. Toplady, idTitian.&#xD;
Suffice it for us to say, in conclusion of this&#xD;
matter, that it forced our hero to shorten his in-&#xD;
tended stay at the watering place. Notwithstand.&#xD;
ing the earnest efforts of the parties to hush it&#xD;
up, it at once became known, and our hero be-&#xD;
came the lion of the place, not for his real posi-&#xD;
tion in the matter, but the very one of which the&#xD;
captain had suspected hun. People were burst-&#xD;
ing with curiosity to see him; the young ladies&#xD;
(in bevies) sought his society and admired his&#xD;
lofty bearing, and a number of gentlemen, who&#xD;
had a chronic indifference fdr their spouses, re-&#xD;
peatedly expressed a desire to introduce the new&#xD;
Don Giovanni nalgre lui to the bosom of their&#xD;
families, by invitations to ride with them, dine&#xD;
with them, and visit them in the city. -&#xD;
All this was extremely repugnant to Moses,&#xD;
especially when lie thought of the extreme pro-&#xD;
bability of these events and this new phase in his&#xD;
reputanon reaching the ears of Miss Wagbull.&#xD;
He resolved to hasten his acceptance of the re-&#xD;
peared invitation of her father to visit, during&#xD;
the season, his country-place in Vermont, on the&#xD;
beautiful banks of the Connecticut, and once&#xD;
there, to disclose, with Mr. Pinksitt's permission,&#xD;
the true facts of the case. As that gentleman&#xD;
felt his happiness was secured, as far as freedom&#xD;
from his late relations was concerned, he was too&#xD;
grateful to make any objection.  Though upon&#xD;
his stating his doubts as to what he should next&#xD;
hear from the eccentric Mrs. Grimble, Moses sug-&#xD;
gested lie would do so only in case of necessity.&#xD;
To those who take an interest in the peculiar&#xD;
position of that lady, we may as well state that&#xD;
the worst of her case was over. She had learned&#xD;
that the artist really loved the country girl, and&#xD;
that was enough for her.  To be sure, she was&#xD;
mad and furious, and several times thereafter&#xD;
rashly threatened an avowal to both her hus-&#xD;
band and Agnes, but she no longer -felt -the&#xD;
same energetic feelings toward the painter she&#xD;
formerly had experienced, and she was now en-&#xD;
abled by the eccentric strength of her character&#xD;
to permanently divert her feelings and thoughts&#xD;
from this somewhat romantic episode in her life,&#xD;
to the more proper interests of legitimately and&#xD;
fashionably ruling her own husband.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLVIII.&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD AND HIS FRIENDS PROcEED TO MA,&#xD;
WAGnULL's COUNTRY-SEAT.&#xD;
0ua hero's friends had been so often enter-&#xD;
tained by Mr. Wagbull in the city, that they grate-.&#xD;
&#xD;
fully resolved he should not sufferaforshaek of&#xD;
.society at his sequestered country-seat. Leaving&#xD;
the temporary pleasures of Saratoa the three&#xD;
high spirits started with Moses upon ai afternoon&#xD;
train toward Mr. Wagbull's estate. Upon tme&#xD;
train there were the usual characters-country-&#xD;
men with large feet and women with small babies;&#xD;
comieicial travelers, running for their employ-&#xD;
0ers, including one who was running away from&#xD;
Ihis; a marble proprietor thinking of the iuiex-&#xD;
haustible irok in his quarry, a dyspeptic patient&#xD;
thiniiigof the iiiexhaustible rock in his stomach ;&#xD;
and( above ifl, the inquisitive Yankee, on the seat&#xD;
next behind you, who, after having used up with&#xD;
his qutaions the fat man on the seat beside him,&#xD;
turns his attention to you for the rest of the voy-&#xD;
age. At the Castleton depot, the antiquated por-&#xD;
ter of the village hotel, with a horse aid cart, ap-&#xD;
parently-older than himself, transported to the&#xD;
tavern for the night our party and their baggage,&#xD;
ingeniously overcoming his atmiinal's obstinate an-&#xD;
tipathy to locomotion by tying his nose in a bag&#xD;
of oats, and causing the deluded creature to chase&#xD;
them. The proprietor of the hotel was enjo3 ing&#xD;
the gentle game of euchre in the bar-rooin, and&#xD;
that lie might not neglect the village cronies with&#xD;
whom he was thus engaged, left the attendance&#xD;
of our party entirely to the porter. Owing to the&#xD;
chilly dampness of the evening, a brilliant fire had&#xD;
been humanely lighted for these worthies upon&#xD;
the bar-room hearth, but none in the parlor,&#xD;
another proof that the landlord's regard was for&#xD;
the friends who thus assisted him in enjoyi-g life&#xD;
at ls own expense, rather than ffor the guests&#xD;
who assisted him to enjoy it at theirs. Moses&#xD;
occupied the time until nine ,in writing in his&#xD;
chamber, and Mr. Toplady in reading a Ledger&#xD;
of the previous December by the fire in the bar-&#xD;
room, where Mr. Barnard had forced himself into&#xD;
the card-party and astounded the entire company&#xD;
by winning every game. Mr. Titman undertook&#xD;
a walk in the twilight with a bottle-nosed, white-&#xD;
hatted native, who was evidently suffering from a&#xD;
depression of spirits, for the professional purpose&#xD;
of examining the ancient church, and other speci-&#xD;
mens of Yankee architecture in the neighborhood.&#xD;
From this, howeve-, lie shortly returned, having&#xD;
been om'ercomne by the gloom of his cieeroie, who,&#xD;
over his wife's tombstone in- a lonely corner of&#xD;
the churchyard,'had asked for a small subscrip-&#xD;
tion toward renewing the inscription thereon,&#xD;
ani intimated suicide in case of disappointment.&#xD;
Whereat Mr. Titan, thinking murder more pre-&#xD;
sumptive, had abruptly fled from the spot. After&#xD;
tea, more village habitues of the tap dropped in,&#xD;
ostensibly to watch the game of cards, but really&#xD;
to await the opportunity of being invited to drink&#xD;
by the popular landlord. Upon these occasions,&#xD;
which were quite numerous during the evenimmg,&#xD;
they invariably endeavored to give an accidental&#xD;
appearance to the consummation of the longed-for&#xD;
event, by becomniig suddenly interested in, and&#xD;
laughing boisterously at some anecdote, which&#xD;
had passed unnoticed before. Presently one of&#xD;
these worthies, reminded by the clock of his con-&#xD;
jugal promise to be at home in an hour, irritatedly&#xD;
bewails the miseries of married life, and after a&#xD;
short and touching silence among them, another&#xD;
hepcedflow sardonically makes the remark:±&#xD;

109                        -     MR. WINK&#xD;
relation, perpetrates his witticism thereon, and is p&#xD;
quiet for a minute or two in his efforts to appear t]&#xD;
unaffected by it, though swelling visibly from its h&#xD;
internal effect, and looking around at various mdi- b&#xD;
viduals to observe its result upon them. Finally,&#xD;
unable to contain himself longer, he laughs violent-&#xD;
ly, and rising, goes outside for the purpose of recov- v&#xD;
ering himself. Then two or three of the henpecked a&#xD;
ones make the tremendous resolve that they will&#xD;
not go home till they get ready. Then there is aT&#xD;
pause in the game and another drink is taken.&#xD;
Then warmed. by the spirits imbibed, the jovial t&#xD;
host takes a chew of tobacco, and commences toa&#xD;
alternately expectorate and sing, in persistent I&#xD;
monotony, a pathetic ballad about some unfortu-v&#xD;
nate maiden, the whole party joining regularly in (&#xD;
the chorus, which is some facile air of the day, t&#xD;
married to the immortal verse of&#xD;
"Dodle, dodle, dodle, chip chum,&#xD;
Tchl, tchooral lay lay V"&#xD;
At the conclusion of this affecting performances&#xD;
Moses, who has seen enough of village enjoyments,4&#xD;
in company with Mr. Titman, does what Mr. Top-&#xD;
lady did two hours before, and retires, leaving Mr.&#xD;
Barnard actively engaged with great prospect of&#xD;
success, in bringing about a fight between two old&#xD;
fellows, who have got to disputing-about the rela-&#xD;
tive weight and beauty of their respective pigs.&#xD;
Finally, the September night in rayless majesty&#xD;
from her ebon throne looks down upon a slum-&#xD;
bering world.&#xD;
The next morning, after a delightful country&#xD;
breakfast, Brunswick arrived with the gentle-&#xD;
men's thick wardrobe, and the party then resumed&#xD;
the railroad for Chester, the nearest village to&#xD;
Mr. Wagbull's country-seat. As the train was&#xD;
not very remarkable for speed, Mr. Barnard en-&#xD;
deavored to relieve its tedium, by humorous re-&#xD;
quests to the indignant conductor for the privilege&#xD;
of getting off and picking some apples, promising&#xD;
to cut him off at the next bend, by smoking weeds&#xD;
in the baggage-car with Brunswick, and by riding&#xD;
upon the engine. Mr. Toplady -and Mr. Titman&#xD;
went to sleep, and Moses looked out upon the&#xD;
scenery. At a station where a freight train was&#xD;
awaiting the right to the road, Moses was much&#xD;
surprised by observing his diplomatic friend, Mr.&#xD;
De St. Beaut6, stand upon the roof of one of its&#xD;
cars in company with a brakeman. As. soon as&#xD;
he saw Moses, the attache immediately descended&#xD;
and entered the passenger train.&#xD;
"Ha! ha! You thought I was in a curious&#xD;
place, eh?  But secrecy, my dear sir, secrecy.&#xD;
I've been to Canada, on this reciprocity hash,&#xD;
and was quietly on my way back," said that lively&#xD;
individual.&#xD;
"It is quite singular we should meet at this&#xD;
distance from the city, isn't it ?" said Moses.&#xD;
"Not at all! The first time I met Lord Strat-&#xD;
ford was in.Paris on the service, and I met him&#xD;
the second time on a mountain in Afghanistan as&#xD;
a tourist. He had ascended one side of the moun-&#xD;
tain, and I the other. He sat down on one side&#xD;
of the peak to cut a troublesome corn on the right&#xD;
foot, and I was engaged with one on my left, when&#xD;
we discovered each other. Positive fact, sir."&#xD;
" By heaven ! But you have traveled in Asia ?"&#xD;
continued Moses hastily.&#xD;
" Traveled! I have been thirty-three times on&#xD;
the overland route to India. 'I was drowned in&#xD;
the Red Sea once, thrown on shore, my body&#xD;
&#xD;
FIELD.&#xD;
kicked up by natives, robbed, carried on a camel&#xD;
hirty miles and sold to an Arabian medical phi-&#xD;
osopher before I came to. Ha! ha! you don't&#xD;
elieve the story, I suppose ?"&#xD;
"No, I don't," replied Moses.&#xD;
"Neither would the Arab philosopher who&#xD;
wanted to have the villagers stone me to death,&#xD;
)s a lying Christian, so he could get my body !"&#xD;
" How did you get out of it ?" asked Mr. Tit-&#xD;
man curiousif.&#xD;
"I brought my diplomatic training and logic to&#xD;
bear. I denied I was vitber liar or Christian,&#xD;
and offered to prove it to him. And he said he'd&#xD;
et me off,ifI did. So I told him if I said I&#xD;
was a Christian, I was a liar, or else I'd be no&#xD;
Christian in saying so, for according to his doc-&#xD;
trine, all Christians were liars.- And if I said I&#xD;
was a liar, I was no Christian, or else I would.be&#xD;
lying in saying so, or words to that effect. I&#xD;
told that to Motley and Sir Frederick Spruce, in&#xD;
Austria. We were taking an omelet together,&#xD;
souffpee au rhum. They laughed so, that they&#xD;
couldn't eat any more, and o-dered me to take&#xD;
it off."&#xD;
"What ! The omelet?"&#xD;
"What was I saying ? I mean they ordered it&#xD;
off-and took me up on the veracity of my&#xD;
anecdote."&#xD;
"You know Sir Frederick well?" asked Mr.&#xD;
Toplady.&#xD;
"Intimately-like you, a little, eh?   Old&#xD;
bachelor-never seen any one he liked, or any&#xD;
one that liked him, ha! ha l" replied the diplo-&#xD;
mat vivaciously.&#xD;
" I met him once in Washington, sir. I am&#xD;
a mere acquaintance, sir, and as such, I do not&#xD;
feel authorized in alluding familiarly to his attri-&#xD;
butes, sir!" said Mr. Toplady, with great severity.&#xD;
"Neither do II Any more than I would to yours,&#xD;
for instance. I know the respect due to age, of&#xD;
course, sir. But the fair sex, you know, will look&#xD;
for personal beauty. You are aware of their fas-&#xD;
tidiousness, no doubt, from your own experience,&#xD;
eh ?",&#xD;
That Mr. Toplady's indignation was materially&#xD;
increased by these remarks, appeared in the look&#xD;
of searching intensity which he bestowed on the&#xD;
jocular diplomat thereat. As it seemed entirely&#xD;
lost upon the latter, however, it gradually disap-&#xD;
peared from Mr. Toplady's countenance.&#xD;
"By the way, how far down do you go to-day ?"&#xD;
asked the attache, of Moses carelessly.&#xD;
"We are going to stop at Chester," replied&#xD;
Moses.&#xD;
" Singular thing! Another coincidence; I was&#xD;
gomg to stop there too I"&#xD;
Here the conductor collected the tickets, and&#xD;
Mr. De St. Beaut6 produced his.&#xD;
" This is a pass for freight trains only !" said&#xD;
the conductor, examining it.&#xD;
"Very well, you can come back presently and&#xD;
I'll settle the fare, I am engaged in conversation&#xD;
now. Yes, I thought of stopping a day or two&#xD;
at Chester, Winkfield."&#xD;
"I am happy to hear it. We are going to a&#xD;
country-seat near there-and-"&#xD;
" We may meet again before I leave. Yes !"&#xD;
continued the diplomat. " Though I've sent my&#xD;
baggage with my servant as far as Springfield-.&#xD;
And a most amusirig thing, just before Ilft, I1&#xD;
changed my pantaloons and sent them, pocket-&#xD;
book and all, ahead. Ha ! ha ! I haven't a cent&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WIN&#xD;
with me, a diplomat in distress!I By the way,&#xD;
suppose you favor me with twenty dollars for the&#xD;
moment, Winkfield."     .&#xD;
"I will, if I have it," replied Moses, with a&#xD;
momentary serious air, "Certainly."&#xD;
" Exquisite practical joke on myself, eh ?" con-&#xD;
tinued the diplomat, laughing vociferously as he&#xD;
took the money. "Ha! ha! I pant for my&#xD;
pants! I long to go along !"&#xD;
Moses did not feel much inclined to laugh at&#xD;
these witticisms, and as for the exquisite practical&#xD;
joke, if it was played on any one, it appeared to&#xD;
be on himself. However, he now recovered his&#xD;
feelings, an4l listened with much philosophical&#xD;
pleasure to his lively acquaintance, who continued&#xD;
to rattle on with his diplomatic. anecdotes or to&#xD;
criticize the peculiarities of the various passen-&#xD;
gers in the car. "See that unpleasant old gen-&#xD;
tleman over there quarreling with his neighbor&#xD;
about having the window up. He is a retired&#xD;
merchant, with nothing to do but to go about&#xD;
and fight in this way to pass his time. And that&#xD;
individual just ahead of him with the whiskers.&#xD;
He is a Bostonian, drawing his head into his&#xD;
shoulders and trying to pass himself off as an&#xD;
Englishman without any neck. I have a great&#xD;
knowledge of nationalities, sir. That old lady&#xD;
there, with the cat shut up in a flower-pot, I'd&#xD;
swear her father was a Scotchman, and her&#xD;
mother a North of Ireland woman, by the way&#xD;
she sneezes, taking snuff!"&#xD;
And so he went on until the train arrived at&#xD;
Chester, pleasing Moses very much with his&#xD;
judgment of human nature, and his diplomatic&#xD;
experience, while his lively exaggerations and&#xD;
sociability made him a very agreeable companion&#xD;
to the others. Even Mr. Toplady felt authorized&#xD;
to smile at his familiarities, as long as they were&#xD;
not with his own properties and attributes.&#xD;
Mr. Wagbull and the Irish boy were awaiting&#xD;
them at the depot. The former greeted them&#xD;
heartily, and the latter grinned with pleasure at&#xD;
seeing our hero. Upon learning that Mr. De St.&#xD;
Beauty was 'an acquaintance of Moses, and at&#xD;
leisure, Mr. Wagbull insisted upon the pleasure&#xD;
of his society, too, at the country-seat, and the&#xD;
affable attach, without much reluctance, con-&#xD;
sented to furnish it at once. They passed over&#xD;
a beautiful road winding along the bank of the&#xD;
river, and at last came in sight of the fine man-&#xD;
sion of Mr. Wagbull, placed.on a terrace at some&#xD;
distance from the stream, with a lawn in front, a&#xD;
grove-of trees at one side, and a commanding&#xD;
view on the other, according to the true rules of&#xD;
landscape art.  The house was of the class&#xD;
styled follies, though perhaps, the only folly con-&#xD;
nected with it, was the proprietor's supposition&#xD;
that the admiration of his neighbors would over-&#xD;
come their natural propensity to the billingsgate&#xD;
of envy in talking about it. Winding up to the-&#xD;
terrace, Moses saw ladies and gentlemen upon&#xD;
the lawn, and, in particular, one beautiful face&#xD;
which sent a thrill of joy to his heart.&#xD;
-CHAPTER XLIX.&#xD;
Moss AND HIS ParzNDS RocEED To nm goy Tnn&#xD;
-HOSPITALITY OP "THE FOLLY. '&#xD;
How muck more delightful, thought Moses,&#xD;
in observing the gayety which reigned at " The&#xD;
&#xD;
FIELD.                                 109&#xD;
Folly," how much more delightful to pass the&#xD;
summer in this rational manner than to expend&#xD;
it in the innumerable dress-parades of fashionable&#xD;
watering-placesI A healthy excitement is ob-&#xD;
tained, to which there is no reaction of lassitude&#xD;
or spleen, in the wooing of nature instead of art&#xD;
and to a person of his feelings we may add,&#xD;
what ecstasy is there greater or more tranquil&#xD;
withal, than that which is offered in the walks&#xD;
amid nodding groves, the mossy seat beneath the&#xD;
shady beech-tree with the dearest of friends, or&#xD;
the proud defense of the timid female against&#xD;
the sinister-looking cows. And so thought Mr.&#xD;
Titman, as his eyes met the glances of a tall&#xD;
young lady, a distant relation of Miss Wagbull.&#xD;
As for Mr. Barnard, the promised shooting and&#xD;
fishing, the stables and capital dinners, furnished&#xD;
food enough for his hopes. But we are sorry to&#xD;
say that Mr. Toplady did not partake of the others'&#xD;
satisfaction.  Miss De Pompenkops, the proud&#xD;
descendant of the ancient Dutch horticultural&#xD;
aristocracy, was one of the guests, and not oily&#xD;
she, but also the easy, tranquil Mr. Beckman-&#xD;
bobuts.   The very first sight  Mr. Toplady&#xD;
caught, on his entrance into the grounds of the&#xD;
house, was that of Mr. Beekman delicately ad-&#xD;
justing a field-glass to enable her to examine a&#xD;
horse-fly in the air, which she had taken to be&#xD;
an eagle, swooping from his mountain eyrie. We&#xD;
will not say what his exact sensations were at&#xD;
that moment. Suffice it to say, that he com-&#xD;
menced at once looking through a magnifying-&#xD;
glass too, the distorting instrument of jealousy,&#xD;
despair, murder, madness, suicide, and general&#xD;
dizziness of morals. Miss Do Pompenkops re-&#xD;
ceived him upon the piazza quite cordially, and the&#xD;
fosterer of the noble whiskers courteously shook&#xD;
his hand; but it seemed to him as though the&#xD;
reception of the one were the pitying friendship&#xD;
for misplaced hope, and the other, the magnani-&#xD;
mous friendship of successful rivalry.  Mr. St.&#xD;
Beauty met. with general favor. .He had in-&#xD;
stantly ingratiated himself with Mr. Wagbull by&#xD;
his profound knowledge of international relations&#xD;
and if lie, felt his tenure was uncertain in any&#xD;
place, he was aware the one he was in at the mo-&#xD;
ment was just as good as any other. Etigaging&#xD;
manners and self-possession are but small social&#xD;
weapons, compared with the great gun of per-&#xD;
sistent flattery. This is no gift, but an acquire-&#xD;
ment. Every one is certainly satirical at times&#xD;
and precisely the same formulas are used in com-&#xD;
pliment as in sarcasm, but the one is genial and&#xD;
the other is not; Mr. St. Beauty, with great good&#xD;
sense, concluded it was just as easy and vastly&#xD;
better to flatter than to ridicule. In particular&#xD;
was he judicious, in insinuating the possession by&#xD;
his pleased victims.of faculties and other gifts of&#xD;
nature which they did not have. His official&#xD;
travels had stocked his memory-with many&#xD;
amusing personal anecdotes, he was a fine judge&#xD;
of cooking, no dish but he knew the name of,&#xD;
and he seemed a good one of wines. The dis-&#xD;
play of these accomplishments constitutes half of&#xD;
the science of diplomacy as viewed by outsiders.&#xD;
The other half consists in having mysterious&#xD;
and unintelligible views of public events. And&#xD;
certainly he here succeeded admirably ; for in&#xD;
vain did our hero, Mr. Wagbull, or any one else,&#xD;
essay more than a half-dozena sentences with liini&#xD;
upon such subjects, before they were completely&#xD;
overpowered with admiration at, and compelled to&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7256-00000056"/>&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD&#xD;
&#xD;
withdraw for meditation upon, the wonderful con-&#xD;
cealment into which he generally managed to&#xD;
crrry his views. Language with him was the&#xD;
diplomatic strong-box in which at once to pre-&#xD;
serve and hide his ideas.&#xD;
What a sublime scene is a country gentleman's&#xD;
dinner-table I As words can not describe, we ad.&#xD;
vise our readers to assist at one. When Moses&#xD;
took his seat at Mr. Wagbull's board, on the&#xD;
evening of his arrival, he thought that the god-&#xD;
dess of plenty and of taste had at last made an&#xD;
amicable arrangement to appear for once to-&#xD;
gether. Ile was seated between Miss Wagbull&#xD;
az d her romantic confident, Miss R'ushton, of Bos-&#xD;
ton, whose'visit was the result of a pressing en-&#xD;
treaty of the former, comprised in a short letter&#xD;
of forty-seven pages, each page presenting the&#xD;
appearance of a No. 22, Ames's Sieve, No. 1 be-&#xD;
in" the largest woven size,  The impression&#xD;
which Moses's appearance and bearing tmade&#xD;
upon her, had been duly imparted to Miss Wag-&#xD;
bull at the moment of his arrival, in an agitate:&#xD;
whisper of the words, " Beautiful creature !"&#xD;
The grandmother was also present, and the im-&#xD;
pression which his arrival made upon her, was&#xD;
now conveyed in another whisper, loud enough&#xD;
to be heard all over the table, "What !' that&#xD;
ninny here ?" The aged antagonist had expressly&#xD;
foregone her customary habit of taking her even-&#xD;
ing meal in bed, to appear in ovel whelming ma-&#xD;
j-sty at the table for the purpose of crushing him.&#xD;
Mr. Wagbull, surrounded by Mr. Toplady, Mr.&#xD;
St. Beaut6, and others, including the member of&#xD;
Congress from the district, a portly heavy per-&#xD;
sonage, was in great glory at the foot, occupying&#xD;
himself with the-sublime art of carving, and with&#xD;
discussions of national and foreign affairs.&#xD;
" What do you think, Mr. S'boaty," said he,&#xD;
after he had assisted that diplomatic genius to&#xD;
the wing of a fowl, "of Metternich's doctrines of&#xD;
government?  You diplomatists are wedded to&#xD;
t'tc divine right of kings, no doubt, but can the&#xD;
European governments be compared with the&#xD;
profound yet simple system which guides the re-&#xD;

' Certainly, sir.  Your views are extremely&#xD;

Very good. Very good, indeed," replied thet&#xD;
worthy host. "But in stating it in a brief and&#xD;
concise manner, I was somewhat anxious to ob-&#xD;

"And he is wrong, sir," interrupted the mem-&#xD;
ber of Congress, with flabby impressiveness.&#xD;
" As a man and an American, sir, I deprecate the&#xD;
European system, whether advocated by him or&#xD;
any other man, as extremely pernicious to liberty,'&#xD;
sir, and pronounce it a Machiavellian nuisance to&#xD;
humanity, sir. I do."&#xD;
"Nuisance, sir !  I can not agree with you&#xD;
upon that point. Not at all. As to its being&#xD;
pernicious, we must necessarily distinguish !"&#xD;
"Eli?  But how do you distinguish, sir, and&#xD;
what ?" asked the member of Congress pom-&#xD;
pously.&#xD;
Mr. Barnard was listening to the conversation&#xD;
with great eagerness. His opinion was, that it&#xD;
hid already begun to partake of the nature of&#xD;
what he would desig nate as a "high old discus-&#xD;
sion,"'and from his looks, it was quite evident he&#xD;
was much interested in its issue.&#xD;
" Let us understand each other, sir," continued&#xD;
the lively diplomatist. "Of course, I would not&#xD;
undertake to dispute your enlightened views, Sir&#xD;
Henry, I beg pardon, Me. Buxter. Not at all.&#xD;
Not at all. Pernicious, I dessay. But a nuisance,&#xD;
sacre, as a Frenchman, I say no. I will gener.&#xD;

"Hey?  One half?" said the member of Con-&#xD;
dress staring at the other. "But permit me to&#xD;
ask you, sir, what you can think of a system&#xD;
which-"&#xD;
" Ahl! that is it. Allow me to recall to your&#xD;
memory the chapter of the same-same distin-&#xD;
guished author and diplomatist, Nicks-old Nicks&#xD;

the chapter of his work, sir, where he treats of&#xD;
that point in particular, and, I dessay, you will&#xD;
see you must grant every one of 'te statements&#xD;
he proves in it."&#xD;
"That is so. That is so!" said Mr. Barnard,&#xD;
rubbing his hands and edging on the eccentric&#xD;
diplomatist.  "That can't be denied, at least.&#xD;
(This cockneyfied Frernchman knows as much on&#xD;
the subject as old Foozle does, at any rate!)"&#xD;
" But the point! Vhat is the point, sir ? Let&#xD;
us know what the point is, sir !" exclaimed the&#xD;
member of Congress, with, perhaps, justifiable&#xD;
rimpatience.  "I, for one, do not understand what&#xD;
it is!"&#xD;
" Ha ! h i! I have no doubt of that," returned&#xD;
the diplomatist. "You have doubtless forgotten&#xD;

CHAPTER L.&#xD;
MR. TOPLADY AND MR. TITMAN PENETRATE INTO&#xD;
HIDDEN BAcK-cOUNTRIEs. THE WAY IN WHICH&#xD;
THEY SET OUT, AND THE WAY IN WHICH THEY&#xD;
RETURNED FROM THEIR EXPLORATION.&#xD;
BAcK from Mr. Wagbull's estate, in a secluded&#xD;
and sparsely-settled township, there was a beau-&#xD;
tiful lake to which it was suggested by Mr. Wag-&#xD;
bull that his guests should pay a day's visit.&#xD;
There were boats on the pond, owned by a neigh-&#xD;
boring farmer, who let them to picnic parties,&#xD;
and to secure these properly prepared for the&#xD;
day, Mr. Titman volunteered, induced by the hu&#xD;
morous accounts he had heard of the primitive&#xD;
habits of the natives, and persuaded Mr. Top&#xD;
lady, who was disposed to try the effect of ab&#xD;
sence upon Miss De Pompenkops, to accompan)&#xD;
him. As the proposed drive was a lengthy an&#xD;
hilly one, requiring great equine toughness, an&#xD;
as Mr. Titman intimated to the hostler that h(&#xD;
was an experienced driver, that official very judi&#xD;
ciously gave them an animal whose nature h&#xD;
felt had been properly hardened to such trials&#xD;
being one which Mr. Wagbull in eccentric human&#xD;
ity had lately rescued from an omnibus establish&#xD;
meant in the city. The animal and vehicle no'&#xD;
stood ready at the piazza, and we question which&#xD;
of the two stood the stillest. It was a remark&#xD;
able horse. Not a motion could be detected i&#xD;
any part of his sytem, and with the exception o&#xD;
his eyes, he looked more like a grotesque woode&#xD;
image than a live being. Those organs, however&#xD;
made up for any deficiency of animation an3&#xD;
where else. Such a dreadful look, lowering sid&#xD;
wise at the piazza i That horse was a demon,-onl&#xD;
awaiting some such opportunity as this to wipe ou&#xD;
the long series of cruelties and hardships which h&#xD;
had endured at the hand of man, by wiping ou&#xD;
those who might be riding behind him. Titma&#xD;
made several easy witticisms at the "old horse's&#xD;
expense, at which we might conclude the animL&#xD;
indulged in a horse-laugh, if that intense look&#xD;
malignity which lay in the depths of his hal&#xD;
closed eyes did not utterly forbid it. But to pr&#xD;
ceed.&#xD;
The ladies and gentlemen, crowding upon ti&#xD;
piazza, congratulated the two gentlemen up(&#xD;
having safely placed -themse.ves and the lu&#xD;
cheon in the buggy, and the excursionists we&#xD;
about starting, when Mr. Toplady withheld M&#xD;
Titman's hand, and, feigning an air of concern&#xD;
asked, " Will he shy ?" whereupon the air w&#xD;
rent with laughter from all parties present. Ha&#xD;
ing accomplished this innocent pleasantry, t&#xD;
unsuspecting gentleman ordered his compani&#xD;
to drive off. On the road, Mr. Titman soon I&#xD;
gan to manifest that he was any thing but an&#xD;
perienced driver, and Mr. Toplady discovered,&#xD;
the same time, that the horse not only s,hied, b&#xD;
seemed to pick out the most dangerous places&#xD;
&#xD;
the road for that interesting operation. The road&#xD;
was a very rough one, and in many parts passed&#xD;
over exceedingly narrow spots, bounded on one&#xD;
side by deep ravines, and on the other by natural&#xD;
walls of granite. Even at this early stage, Mr.&#xD;
Toplady got into a chronic state of alarm, and&#xD;
more than once expressed a pettish wish that he&#xD;
had not come, which only seemed to increase Mr.&#xD;
Titman's incapacity. The horse's mouth was a&#xD;
very hard one, and Mr. Titman was in constant&#xD;
fear of losing the reins from a truly fearful habit&#xD;
which the animal bad of throwing his head back&#xD;
at unsuspected moments, and jerking at the rib-&#xD;
bons with tremendous force. It was quite evident&#xD;
that no amount of flattery could alter the settled&#xD;
antipathy which he had to proceeding in an order-&#xD;
ly manner. So Mr. Titman, with the assistance of&#xD;
Mr. Toplady, judiciously tied the ends of the&#xD;
reins firmly about a bag of oats beneath the seat,&#xD;
as a kind of anchor in case of distress. Con-&#xD;
siderable time was lost by the necessary care at-&#xD;
tendant on the increasing bad behavior of the&#xD;
beast, and as they lost their way repeatedly, and&#xD;
were constantly getting into lanes, which led to&#xD;
- some mountain barn, pasture, or nowhere, it was&#xD;
fully noon before they succeeded in approaching&#xD;
- their destination.&#xD;
-   As a compromise measure, natural to the eco-&#xD;
nomical habits of early times, the primitive in.&#xD;
I habitants of the two villages of Wolsley and&#xD;
d lalsted had erected a common house of worship&#xD;
e on the boundary line of both, and full three miles&#xD;
- distant from either. The church stood upon the&#xD;
e pinnacle of a tremendous hill, from which a long&#xD;
, view of the heavens, the noble lake, and the sur-&#xD;
- rounding groves, in which the Indians once&#xD;
- lurked, might be had. Still further on the road,&#xD;
w the voyagers had ascertained to be the dwelling-&#xD;
h place of the individual, who united the guardian-&#xD;
i- ship of the meeting-house with the pursuit of&#xD;
n agriculture and the extraction of fish from the&#xD;
Df lake. Mr. Titman congratulated his friend and&#xD;
n his arms on their approach to the neighborhood,&#xD;
r, and their spirits once more rose as they mounted&#xD;
y- the higp hill of promise. As they descended on&#xD;
e- the other side, Mr. Titman relaxed his precaution,&#xD;
y for the animal himself seemed to have business&#xD;
at enough in attending to the rolling stones in the&#xD;
ie washed road. It was the great mistake of the&#xD;
ut excursion, and the extraordinary care which the&#xD;
n horse was manifesting was only a gross piece of&#xD;
" equine deception. As they approached the bottom&#xD;
al of the hill, and just as Mr. Titifan was uttering&#xD;
of an exclamation of satisfaction thereat, the animal&#xD;
If- started off- at lightning speed.  At one side of&#xD;
o- the road stood a barn, sunk below the level of&#xD;
the highway, with its gable end turned toward&#xD;
lie the latter, and in it, convenient for the storage of&#xD;
on hay and other produce in the barn-loft, was a&#xD;
n- window. This window was open, and through it&#xD;
re Mr. Titman was presently transferred from the&#xD;
fr. vehicle, bead foremost and with great precipitan-&#xD;
*n, cy, into the hay, which filled the interior.  The&#xD;
as immediate cause of this was a simple but lucid&#xD;
v- movement of the horse in his mad career, by&#xD;
he which one of the froi t-wheels was twisted be-&#xD;
on- neath the body of the uggy, and the other upon&#xD;

MR. WINK&#xD;
&#xD;
eh? hey! hey !" continued the farmer, laughing.T&#xD;
" Walk in, friends. You needn't think you an't T&#xD;
welcome, because you be Jews. I spose you hi&#xD;
spilt your goods now, hey! hey !"          I&#xD;
"Good God! Jews ! This is the resultof having&#xD;
a Roman nose. We are not peddlers nor thieves, n&#xD;
sir!" said Mr. Toplady raising his voice in re- ti&#xD;
newed irritation. "We are guests of Mr. Wag-&#xD;
bull on the river, and we came on his behalf to "&#xD;
secure your boats for the day after to-morrow !"  e&#xD;
"Very well, I am not deaf, though dad is, hey!&#xD;
hey! Walk right in and sot down. Here, you, g&#xD;
Webster and Johnny, go out of the settin-room  s(&#xD;
to wonst. Wife put on the kettle, p'raps the&#xD;
men would like suthin'."                    p&#xD;
Confidence was thus restored, and Mr. Toplady c&#xD;
at once entered into a thorough narration of the v&#xD;
ride, its object, and its catastrophe, during which r&#xD;
Mr. Titman took an interesting survey of the&#xD;
room. The floor was partly covered with a gor- s&#xD;
geous carpet, composed of the debris of the"&#xD;
breeches, and other habiliments of the family for h&#xD;
the last two generations, and the handiwork of d&#xD;
the industrious good-wife herself.  The usual o&#xD;
asparagus branches had not yet- been removed i&#xD;
from the painted fire-place, two large conch-shellsi&#xD;
and four brass candlesticks adorned the mantel-u&#xD;
-piece, and a stunning picture of Ajax and Achilles&#xD;
hung on the wall, supposed by the natives, on there&#xD;
undoubted authority of the grandfather, to be&#xD;
General Washington and Lord Cornwallis, in thec&#xD;
new undress uniform adopted just after he left&#xD;
the army.!&#xD;
The old gentleman, noticing Mr. Titman's ar-&#xD;
tistic stare at this illustrious print, at once pro-,&#xD;
ceeded to entertain the latter with a long andE&#xD;
rambling story of revolutionary times full of pith&#xD;
and anecdote, but principally bearing upon theI&#xD;
outrageous fact that he never yet had received&#xD;
but eleven dollars of his pension, a dollar a-piece&#xD;
from as many agents, whom he had authorized to&#xD;
collect the same, at various periods since the&#xD;
close of the war. He hoped Mr. Titman would&#xD;
endeavor to procure some information for him on&#xD;
the matter.&#xD;
The latter impulsively promised he would, and&#xD;
continued he, " Is the Commissioner of Pensions,&#xD;
an unconscious instrument of such villainy as this&#xD;
in his bureau, or is he playing himself in this&#xD;
way !"&#xD;
"Yes, as a fifer for four year'n more," replied&#xD;
the, old gentleman, staring hard at Mr. Titman,&#xD;
after the manner of deaf persons, and' watching&#xD;
the motion of the latter's lips.&#xD;
" Ah, You were a musicians,?" said thelatter,&#xD;
raising his voice.&#xD;
"I was wounded and taken prisoner at Still-&#xD;
water," continued the old gentleman, partly at&#xD;
random.&#xD;
"Honor be to all such patriots, who defended&#xD;
their country in its hour of peril !" cried Mr. Tit-&#xD;
man, in a louder key.&#xD;
"Eh?   I am a little hard of hearing," replied&#xD;
the old gentleman. .&#xD;
"1I say, honor be to all such patriots, who de-&#xD;
fended their country in its hour of peril!" re-&#xD;
iterated Mr. Titman, still louder.&#xD;
Rh"?    I am a little hard of hearing, and-"&#xD;
*' I say, honor be to all such patriots !" roared&#xD;
Mr. Titman, " who have-"&#xD;
"REh?- I am a little deaf, you know, and what&#xD;
did you say' ?n"&#xD;
&#xD;
YIELD.&#xD;
"Oh! never mind.     Nothing!" replied Mr.&#xD;
itman, with perhaps a tinge of indignation at&#xD;
is ardent phrase being lost on the old gentle-&#xD;
an.&#xD;
"Ha! ha! Yes. A good joke; but it was&#xD;
A joke to me ! It hurt me like sixty!" con-&#xD;
nued the latter.&#xD;
(" Ah ! He thinks I alluded to his wound !")&#xD;
In what part of your person were you wound.&#xD;
d, sir ?" again vociferated Mr. Titman.&#xD;
"Hey?    Yes. Left behind !" replied the old&#xD;
entleman. "Yes.    I couldn't walk at all, ye&#xD;
ee. I couldn't get away ."&#xD;
Mr. Toplady here called to Mr. Titman: "How&#xD;
rovoking, Titman ! Mr. Staples has a horse he&#xD;
an loan us, but no vehicle," said be;  and the&#xD;
village we came through was away out of our&#xD;
oad 1"&#xD;
"Yes. You oughter struck for the church,&#xD;
straight from the sa-outh !" replied Mr. Staples.&#xD;
Ye see, I lent my carryall to my cousin, and I&#xD;
aven't any thing but a hay-wagon, but you can't&#xD;
lo nothin' with that. Them Millerites on the&#xD;
ther side of the pond have got a buggy, but it&#xD;
s a mighty ways ra-ound, and they won't lend&#xD;
nothin' 'cept to people who are ready to go&#xD;
up V1&#xD;
" Go up !" exclaimed-Mr. Toplady and Mr. Tit-&#xD;
man together. "What do you mean by that-.&#xD;
"Go up to Moses! They believe Millennium is&#xD;
common', hey! hey !"&#xD;
" They don't expect to go up, as you call it, in&#xD;
a buggy, do they ? asked Mr. Toplady, with a&#xD;
grim smile.&#xD;
" No, as they belong to the sulky family them-&#xD;
selves !" said Mr. Titman, laughing very heartily.&#xD;
Here the natural association of ideas in the&#xD;
farmer's mind reminded him that he did have&#xD;
another vehicle under his control. It was on&#xD;
the ground floor of the little barn, near the meet-&#xD;
ing.house. If they were not very squeamish, he'd&#xD;
let 'em have it. By going the short cut they&#xD;
would save five miles, and as the road was pretty&#xD;
much free from houses, no one would see them.&#xD;
It was better than riding three failes in the rain&#xD;
to the village to get a carriage.&#xD;
"Squeamish! Not at all, as long as it will&#xD;
run," said Mr. Toplady.  What kind of vehicle&#xD;
is it?"&#xD;
" It is the meetin'-house hearse," replied the&#xD;
bluff farmer and callous sexton; "and I greased&#xD;
it last week."&#xD;
" Good God !" exclaimed Mr. Toplady and Mr.&#xD;
Titman -in unison.&#xD;
"It lo good and strong, and there is room&#xD;
enough on the seat for two. That is, I think so.&#xD;
But you'd better stay all night. Ulysses will be&#xD;
to home with the wagon to-morrow."&#xD;
Mr. Toplady and Mr. Titman looked at each&#xD;
other. The thought of the festivities at Mr.&#xD;
Wagbull's and the probable alarm of Mr. Wink-&#xD;
field, if they should thus prolong their absence,&#xD;
suggested itself to both. In .desperation, the&#xD;
made up their minds ; and so the farmer le  i&#xD;
horse, a docile animal, to the quasi-barn, or&#xD;
hearse-house. With acapacious cotton umbrella,&#xD;
which the-kind housewife loaned to them, and&#xD;
after many. substantial thanks to her and her&#xD;
husband and the accomplishment of the original&#xD;
mission, our voyagers soon set out on their home-&#xD;
ward journey. There was hardly room for two on&#xD;
the seat of the vehicle, but, with the umbrela to&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WI&#xD;
shelter them from the rain, and their spirits&#xD;
buoyed up by the oddity of the thing, they started&#xD;
off in an extremely lively manner, Mr. Titman&#xD;
holding the reins and cracking his jokes, and Mr.&#xD;
Toplady holding fast to the seat and umbrella, with&#xD;
a firm determination to enjoy it all. It was not&#xD;
long, however, before their spirits fell again. In&#xD;
vain did Mr. Toplady endeavor to keep his seat.&#xD;
Whenever there was any trotting, he was in&#xD;
continual danger of being precipitated to the&#xD;
ground by slipping sidewise, and whether there&#xD;
was any trotting or not, it was useless to attempt&#xD;
to shield himself and friend with the heavy um-&#xD;
brella from the driving blast, against which they&#xD;
were heading. The seat was filled with water,&#xD;
and their legs were completely drenched. Mr.&#xD;
Toplady was accustomed to all the varieties of&#xD;
the water-cure treatment, but such a sitz-bath he&#xD;
positively disliked.&#xD;
"0  dear!   It is of no use !" said he, in&#xD;
utter misery and exhaustion. 41-I can't hold up&#xD;
this dreadful umbrella any longer. I ean't prop&#xD;
it up, or do any thing with it!"&#xD;
"Well, shut it down; it -is of no good !" re-&#xD;
plied Mr. Titman, more anxious than ever to&#xD;
get along the road.&#xD;
"the rheumatism will repay me for -this !"&#xD;
again commenced Mr. Toplady, after a pause.&#xD;
"Never mind I" cried the unfaltering Titman,&#xD;
whipping up the horse.  "We shall, soon be&#xD;
home by this road!"&#xD;
"Stop ! atop, Titman! My legs are aching&#xD;
now," said the unfortunate Toplady. " There is&#xD;
no help for it. I don't like to do it, but I must-&#xD;
I must get inside, Titman !"-&#xD;
"But, good gracious! Supposing any one&#xD;
should find us driving along at this furious rate,"&#xD;
said Mr. Titman, shuddering, " and they should&#xD;
find. you inside in a fit?  0 gracious ! It is&#xD;
too much like-"&#xD;
" Never mind. I am not going to be laid up&#xD;
six weeks, with inflammatory rheumatism, for&#xD;
the sake of appearances ! I am going to get in-&#xD;
side !" said Mr. Toplady determinedly.0&#xD;
They stopped. Mr. Toplady opened the little&#xD;
door at the -back, and crawled in. What his&#xD;
sensations were, after Mr. Titman closed the door&#xD;
upon him, we can not exactly state.&#xD;
An hour or two after this transfer was made&#xD;
on the road, Miss Rushton was looking out of the&#xD;
drawing-room window of Mr. Wagbull's mansion,&#xD;
at the rain, when she descried a conveyance on&#xD;
the distant road.&#xD;
"There is a hearse !" said she, to Miss De&#xD;
Pompenkops. "Some poor person gone to the&#xD;
dark and gloomy abode."&#xD;
" How fast he drives !" ejaculated another&#xD;
young lady. "Why, I declare, he-he is turn-&#xD;
ing in here."&#xD;
"In here ?"&#xD;
"And, heavens! it is-it is Mr. Titman driv-&#xD;
ing !" continued she, in astonishment.&#xD;
"Good gracious !" exclaimed all the ladies in&#xD;
chorus, rushing to the windows.&#xD;
"It is lie! It really is the little man !" cried&#xD;
Miss Rushton, with increased surprise. "No&#xD;
other I Has be been taken insane ? And where&#xD;
is Mr. Toplady ?" .&#xD;
" Why, what does it mean ?" exclaimed they&#xD;
all in chorus again, and looking at each other in&#xD;
utter amazement.&#xD;
Regardless of any thing but the rain, Mr. Tit-&#xD;
&#xD;
NKFIELD-                                 115&#xD;
man drove the vehicle steadily up to the door.&#xD;
I With a short command to his animal, he arrested&#xD;
its progress.  In thoughtful benevolence,the&#xD;
backed the conveyance up to the Piazza. Amid&#xD;
the cries of horror and astonishment, he opened&#xD;
its narrow door and benevolently lent his assist-&#xD;
ance to the disburdening of its unfortunatecOn-&#xD;
tents.&#xD;
Mr. Toplady was carried to his room by the&#xD;
domestics, where he revived sufficiently to call&#xD;
for Moses and a glass of brandy, while Mr. Tit-&#xD;
man sought the drawing-room fire, and there en-&#xD;
deavored, with congealed tongue and incoherent&#xD;
accents, to give a confused account of theradven-&#xD;
tures of the day to the excited assemblage.&#xD;
CHAPTER LI.&#xD;
GEORGE HENRY DOTTLEWASHER.&#xD;
IN the househdid of Mr. Wagbull- there was a&#xD;
very pretty young maid, of English origin, who&#xD;
assisted the cook of the establishment in the&#xD;
important duties of the kitchen, besides attend-&#xD;
ing to those connected with the renovation of&#xD;
the more delicate pieces of linen which could&#xD;
not safely be intrusted to the Irish laundres.&#xD;
This maid, on a bright morning a day or two af-&#xD;
ter the arrival of our friends, was engaged in a&#xD;
little court near the stables in the laudable oc-&#xD;
cupation of hanging out certain of the aforesaid&#xD;
pieces of linen, for the purpose of drying them&#xD;
in the sun, when Mr. de St. Beauty, who had&#xD;
been lounging in the stables, gently digesting his&#xD;
breakfast, in inspecting the horses and meditat-&#xD;
ing perhaps upon the gay existence of the mem-&#xD;
bers of his profession, crossed accidentally the&#xD;
little court for the purpose of returning to the&#xD;
house. The young female, casting her eyes&#xD;
upon him, paused so abruptly in her occupation&#xD;
and gave such a start that her movements arous-&#xD;
ed the meditative gentleman from his reflections.&#xD;
" Hah! taken with my shape P" said the gen-&#xD;
tleman to himself. "Let us see what sort of&#xD;
creature she is before we go in. There is no-&#xD;
body looking, and perhaps-"&#xD;
The girl still stood gazing at him, as if thor-&#xD;
oughly subdued by is appearance.&#xD;
"Ha! ha!I This is love at first sight P" con,&#xD;
tinned the flippant young gentleman.  "It is&#xD;
our duty to attend to it, poor girl !"&#xD;
"George 'Enry l" cried the maid aloud.&#xD;
"Eh ?" said the diplomat with a lively move-&#xD;
ment. "Who called me ? I thought I heard--"&#xD;
" It's him! I am sure of it now I" ejaculated&#xD;
the maid. "George Henry. George Henry Bot-&#xD;
tlewasher I" reiterated she.&#xD;
" Eh ?" continued the young diplomatist, look-&#xD;
ing at her more attentively.  "Oh ! blast it !&#xD;
it's-it's that little girl I met in New-York at-&#xD;
but what do you wish, my girl ?" continued he&#xD;
immediately resuming his assured air. "Shall I&#xD;
be careful of the grass, oh ?"&#xD;
"How, Mr. Geor-ge Henry Bottlewasher ! Don't&#xD;
you recognize me-don't you know the young&#xD;
lady as kept your company when you were in&#xD;
the'Hinglish consul's kitchen in New-York ? And&#xD;
told me confidentially all about how you got&#xD;
kicked out of 'or Majesty's hambassador's at Pa-&#xD;
l-is, and run away to America ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7256-00000059"/>&#xD;
116-                              MR. WI&#xD;
"0 my God, she'll compromise me "&#xD;
" You said very well, I-was too good for you,&#xD;
and now I know it myself, sir !" continued the&#xD;
maid in great indignation.&#xD;
"Good heaven I don't talk so loud, Elizabeth!&#xD;
You'll arouse the house. Young woman, I must&#xD;
correct your error. I am not the person you&#xD;
refer to at all. Not at all ! You confound me&#xD;
with-with some other confounded person !"&#xD;
"Eh! but it is you. I know you very well I"&#xD;
continued the maid in the same strain.&#xD;
" Then you have forgotten who you are your-&#xD;
self, if you say that, Lizzie-I would say, my&#xD;
worthy girl 1&#xD;
"1 have not forgotten myself. _ I know who&#xD;
I am, and what is more, I know I am not like&#xD;
you, perfidious, 'eartless fellow, as you are "&#xD;
"What is going to come of this? Here is&#xD;
my fat in the fire, all on account of a woman&#xD;
again, too !"&#xD;
" It is frightful, 'orrible, your treachery. But&#xD;
I will proclaim it to every one I see !" continued&#xD;
the girl, overcome by her feelings and putting&#xD;
her apron to her eyes.&#xD;
" Oh ! the devil is in the pot! there is no use&#xD;
now-she's got to crying !" said the gentleman,&#xD;
" by gravy, if any one should happen to come&#xD;
this way-Lizzie ! I am just now dearly expiat-&#xD;
ing the crime of my forgetfulness. The storms&#xD;
of life are descending on me I I am being dish-&#xD;
ed and served up half-cooked by a cruel fate, but&#xD;
know that not my interest alone but yours, my&#xD;
dearest duck, has induced me to pawn my iden-&#xD;
tity and the fair name of Bottlewasher for--for&#xD;
drachmas-and here-here on bended knee,"&#xD;
continued the wild young gentleman, looking&#xD;
hastily toward the house, "I renew the assurance&#xD;
of my distinguished affection !",&#xD;
"Well! at least you remember your Lizzie.&#xD;
You are not so cruel as to forget her features I"&#xD;
" Hallo!1 what is all that ?" said Mr. Wagbull,&#xD;
entering the inclosure through the garden-gat&#xD;
just at this moment. "I say, S'boaty, that i&#xD;
rather lively, isn't it?"&#xD;
" Great Dina of the Effeezus ! It is shy wor&#xD;
thy host !" exclaimed the penitent lover, jump&#xD;
ing up. "I dare say, my host, you think I wa&#xD;
attempting to throw myself at her feet V"&#xD;
"I don't know about that, but you certainlI&#xD;
were at them !"&#xD;
"Well, it did look like it, I must confess. Bu&#xD;
you see the wind was blowing away one of thes&#xD;
napkins, or diapers, or whatever they are, and in&#xD;
pure gallantry I had to secure it for her. As at&#xD;
organ of international and domestic -courtesy,&#xD;
put on my diapason stop, ha ! ha ! Do you see?&#xD;
"1I must say, I do not exactly, my friend. How&#xD;
ever, boys will be boys!"&#xD;
"Yes, she didn't want to lose her napkins, an(&#xD;
I didn't want to lose my illusions, ha! ha! It i&#xD;
the French school of diplomacy I was educate&#xD;
in, eh ! ha! ha!'&#xD;
"I've no doubt of it. Well, well, come alone&#xD;
with me to the billiard-room, and see how man&#xD;
points you wish me to give you."&#xD;
CHAPTER LII'.&#xD;
Tmgl BAcK-SEAT OP THlE WAGON.&#xD;
UroN. the occasion of the picnic excursion I&#xD;
the picturesque lake of Halsted, Mr. Toplady wI&#xD;
&#xD;
NKFIELD.&#xD;
delighted. Miss De Pompenkops, the proud de-&#xD;
scendant of one of the great blooded Dutch fan-&#xD;
ilies of Ameriea, had c)osen him to be her venv-&#xD;
her. He determined to make it a day of earnest-&#xD;
ness. There should be no play about it for him.&#xD;
After a charming drive upon the bright September&#xD;
morning, the party arrived at the lovely sheet of&#xD;
water; the opinion of the natives, on the route,&#xD;
at the appearance of Mr. Winkfield's eye-glass,&#xD;
Mr. Beekman's whiskers, and the lively demonstra-&#xD;
tion of Mr. Barnard and Mr. St. Beauty on horse&#xD;
back, having been divided as to whether the caval-&#xD;
cade was a circus, or the son of the British queen&#xD;
with his suite, whom they "had heern tell was&#xD;
aba-out in the country." Miss Do Pompenkops&#xD;
expressing a passion for the manly scenes afforded&#xD;
by the virile art, Mr. Toplady at once determined&#xD;
to row, much to the satisfaction of an indolent&#xD;
yung gentleman by the name of Mills, who shared&#xD;
with him the responsibility of propelling one of&#xD;
the boats. He grasped the oars, and at once set&#xD;
out in rash magnificence.&#xD;
"Why, you be goiu! wrong cend foremost,&#xD;
Mister!" cried one of the sexton's boys, lying on&#xD;
the platform.&#xD;
Eh .So I am," said Mr. Toplady, hastily re-&#xD;
versing his strokes and running the boat back&#xD;
into the platform, by its contact with which, he&#xD;
flew into Miss Rushton's embrace, causing her in&#xD;
agitated union with Miss Pompenkops to topple&#xD;
backward upon Mr. Mills, who at once communi-&#xD;
cated the momentum with his head to the bottom&#xD;
of the boat, where it was duly annihilated.&#xD;
"What an awkward, clumsy boat this is ." ex-&#xD;
claimed Mr. Toplady, recovering himself.&#xD;
."Wait, Mister, ye must sit ra-ound t'otlrer way.&#xD;
said the boy, pausing in his unrestrained laughter&#xD;
at Mr. Toplady'sinexperience. "Stern on, I will&#xD;
push ye off."&#xD;
Mr. Toplady obeyed, and starting off again, ran&#xD;
at once into a lily-pad at one side of his route,&#xD;
from the natural disproportion of strength in his&#xD;
arms.&#xD;
"Why will you play such merry pranks, Mr.&#xD;
- Toplady ?" cried Miss Rushton archly. "Do go&#xD;
- ahead. See, the other boats are far out."&#xD;
" Well, I will," replied Toplady perspiring.&#xD;
"Mills, don't let me deprive you of the pleasure&#xD;
y of rowing. 1-11&#xD;
" Oh! do feather the oars, Mr. Toplady l" ex-&#xD;
t claimed Miss De Pompenkops.    It is so beauti-&#xD;
e ful to see the bending blade, now dividing the&#xD;
n sparkling wave and now dripping in the sun's&#xD;
n splendor.".&#xD;
" '1Certainly!" said the gallant Toplady, tugging&#xD;
" in agony at the oars, and with difficulty retaining&#xD;
them in his hands.      -&#xD;
"Oh! yes, we all know you have a genius for&#xD;
d feathering the oars, Mr. Toplady !" chimed in Miss&#xD;
s Rushton.&#xD;
d    Mr. Toplady felt it might be possible, as he&#xD;
had never tried, and presently he essayed various&#xD;
g violent and paralytic motions with his wrists, with&#xD;
y the assurance of showing thereby that he could&#xD;
do something extraordinary with the oars, even&#xD;
if he should not strike upon the aquatic mystery&#xD;
alluded to. Then, after alternate exclamations&#xD;
these coplicated actions, he relaxed his effort&#xD;
from .sheer exhaustion, and Mr. Mills relieved&#xD;
to him.1 Then, as they approached the opposite&#xD;
is shore, he in turn relieved Mr. Mills, and was&#xD;

standing near him, while the ladies; whom Mr. for a farewell dinner, on the following Sunday,&#xD;
Toplady had so ungallantly deserted, might be with some religious friends, who expected to go&#xD;

est in her, to speak generally; was no doubt that&#xD;
of predestinated affection ; yet it had been up to&#xD;
this moment-in particular, since his hasty de-&#xD;
monstration in her drawing-room-that respectful,&#xD;
reverential sympathy, which might be termed by&#xD;
keen dissecters of character, social poltroonery&#xD;
and fear of her. But now there arose in his&#xD;
bosom an intenser emotion, akin to that insane&#xD;
impulse which impels fascinated moths or horses&#xD;
to seek the flames which are to consume them.&#xD;
As he fell headlonginto the lake, he had thought,&#xD;
amid his excitement, as he went over, that he&#xD;
heard his name, the familiar name of Effingham,&#xD;
breathed in terrified affection from her lips. He&#xD;
was not sure, but the possibility had refined his&#xD;
reason, and he had been silently exercising it&#xD;
during the whole afternoon. And now, thought&#xD;
he, should he weakly suffer to pass a felicitous&#xD;
moment, and dash the cup from his lips as it was&#xD;
presented ? Should he relinquish the golden op--&#xD;
portunity of securing the treasure for which he&#xD;
had ventured into the toils of numerous tailors,&#xD;
florists, barbers and jockeys, when it was just&#xD;
within his grasp ? Should he, after having once&#xD;
compromised his equanimity of feeling by dis-&#xD;
closing on his knees, and in his best pantaloons,&#xD;
his preference,.blush out the remainder of his life,&#xD;
and die a poor, single, scorned thing, because he&#xD;
had not spirit enough to show he knew how to&#xD;
properly do it? -To." He would seize the golden&#xD;
opportunity afforded by the back-seat, and  de-&#xD;
clare his passion or-perish in the attempt!&#xD;
" How beautiful is the country," said she pen-&#xD;
sively.  "I could live here all thle year, were&#xD;
there only society."I&#xD;
" And without that, you would derive happiness*&#xD;
here as elsewhere, from the very reflex of your&#xD;
own presence," replied Mr. Toplady. "Yes, you&#xD;
would be happy here too !"&#xD;
" How, Mr. Toplady ? Without the fashions,&#xD;
without taste, without the intercourse with well-&#xD;
bred people?  Observe the shocking manners and&#xD;
dress of the natives. Oh! no, it would be unen-&#xD;
durable !"&#xD;
" But would not the society-the love of one&#xD;
here, be a sufficient consolation for the absence&#xD;
of the mere admiration of the hollow many there ?"&#xD;
suggested Mr. Toplady, with a leer.&#xD;
" The affection of the commoner sort of people&#xD;
seems, indeed, to thrive in such a rude existence&#xD;
of solitude and exile, but to persons of refine-&#xD;
ment, the delightful appliances of refinement and&#xD;
taste'seem necessary to render mutual sympathy&#xD;
exquisite or heaven-like, do they not ?"&#xD;
There seemed a faltering weakness in her tones,&#xD;
as if they were those of a reluctant confession.&#xD;
His arm was upon the back of the seat. He&#xD;
was violently impelled by some unknown, unseen,&#xD;
and unearthly power. The mellowness of the&#xD;
hour, softened by the graceful shadows, was in&#xD;
unison with thepensive tenderness of feeling which&#xD;
she seemed in vain endeavoring to conceal. The&#xD;
parties oi the front-seat were occupied.&#xD;
" Beloved being! My danger this morning&#xD;
affected you!" whispered he agitatedly. " I saw&#xD;
it as I sunk! And let this sign of my impas-&#xD;
sioned hope in return, now properly imprinted on&#xD;
your fair brow, be a token to you of the everlast-&#xD;
ing sympathy of our hearts !"&#xD;
With this the rash gentleman at once precipi-&#xD;
tated himself upon his fair companion's form,&#xD;
crushing her bonnet completely and succeeding&#xD;

IL wim  W., VIkTl&#xD;

MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;

in planting his osculatory blow, somewhere under&#xD;
her left eye. The neighboring air was filled with&#xD;
a wild scream.&#xD;
-The astonishment of Mr. Mills and Miss Wag-&#xD;
bull who were on the front -seat, may be con-&#xD;
ceived, when on turning they observed Miss&#xD;
Pompenkops apparently fainted, and Mr. Toplady&#xD;
in the act of frantically leaping oyer a stone wall&#xD;
at the side of the road.  0&#xD;
" Good God! What is the matter ?" hastily&#xD;
cried Mr. Mills.,&#xD;
" He-Mr. Toplady-sir-I-0 Miss Wag-&#xD;
bull!" incoherently murmured the lady. t&#xD;
"Why, she has the hysterics !" cried Miss&#xD;
Wagbull, hastily placing herself at the unfortun-&#xD;
ate young lady's side and sustaining her form.&#xD;
"But what has Mr. Toplady gone for?" asked&#xD;
Mr. Mills.&#xD;
" Heavens, I scarce can tell!  For water&#xD;
from a spring perhaps, to revive her !" conjec-&#xD;
tured the confused Bessie.&#xD;
The young lady here sat up, opened her eyes&#xD;
and looked around.   "Mr. Toplady, I-why,&#xD;
where is Mr. Toplady ?" asked she agitatedly.&#xD;
" He has gone into the woods. What is it,&#xD;
deary ? You are better now. Did-you see some-,&#xD;
thing unexpected, some horrible sight?" asked&#xD;
Bessie tenderly.&#xD;
" Has he" gone? Heavens ! Yes, yes, I saw a&#xD;
terrible, cruel sigt-a poor wounded bird, a&#xD;
weak fluttering thing, and Mr. Toplady-yes, he&#xD;
must have gone to rescueit !" replied Miss De&#xD;
Pompenkops. "But surely he will speedily re-&#xD;
turn," continued she, raising her voice and making&#xD;
her accents quite distinct.&#xD;
She was mistaken, though they awaited his re-&#xD;
turn for some time, during which she minutely-&#xD;
recounted the scene of the wounded bird. Mr.&#xD;
Toplady did not appear. They called him by&#xD;
name, shouted their impatience, and Mr. Mills&#xD;
dismounted and looked a short distance into the&#xD;
shadowy precincts of the forest.&#xD;
" This is a most singular thing !" said he.&#xD;
" He must have got lost in the thicket and&#xD;
wandered out of the reach of our voices !")&#xD;
They renewed their calls and shouts, and Mr.&#xD;
Mills, at Miss De Pompenkops's request, endeavor-&#xD;
ed to convey to the erratic gentleman's ears. her&#xD;
special commands for his return, but his efforts&#xD;
were useless.&#xD;
" There is a bend in the road above here. He&#xD;
may have wandered through the forest and&#xD;
joined one of the wagons ahead of us," suggested&#xD;
Bessie.  "4OP at least he may be awaiting us&#xD;
upon the road !"&#xD;
All hope of his return to them there being&#xD;
dissipated, they accepted this doubtful solution,&#xD;
and drove on, expecting to be accosted by him at&#xD;
every turn and corner of the road. But he did&#xD;
not appear. The shades of night fell thicker and&#xD;
thicker, and finally in darkness they were forced&#xD;
to proceed impatiently toward home, relying upon&#xD;
the presumption of finding him there.&#xD;
For four hours after their arrival, the whole&#xD;
household in commotion and eager expectancy&#xD;
awaited the sounds of footsteps upon the gravel,&#xD;
or of the farmer's wagon, which might possibly&#xD;
be bringing the lost gentleman back to his home,&#xD;
while the impatient Moses, with Brut swick amid&#xD;
other domestics frequently sallied down the road&#xD;
with 'lanterns to aid his belated return. Just as&#xD;
Mr. Wagbull, at a moment considerably past&#xD;
&#xD;
midnight, was ordering out the entire strength&#xD;
of his stables and his household for an organized&#xD;
search, Brunswick, in visiting Mr. Toplady's&#xD;
apartment, for that gentleman's overcoat, dis-&#xD;
covered himin bed soundly sleeping.    His&#xD;
clothes were much disordered, his boots soiled&#xD;
with the mud of swamps and the dust of the&#xD;
highway, and he bore the appearance of being,&#xD;
greatly fatigued.&#xD;
After unknown and superhuman exertions, the&#xD;
wretched gentleman had reached the house, and&#xD;
rather with the feelings of a murderer than a re-&#xD;
spectable human being, had unobservedly sneaked&#xD;
up by the back way to his room, where, over-&#xD;
come with fatigue, with thoughts of self-slaugh-&#xD;
ter, or at least the necessity of perpetual intoxi-&#xD;
cation to make life bearable, he had sunk in&#xD;
slumber. Relieved of their fears, his friends&#xD;
permitted him to remain undisturbed, and re-&#xD;
tired themselves to await a thorough explanation&#xD;
in the morning, of what was certainly an extra-&#xD;
ordinary adventure, if not proceeding, upon the&#xD;
part of a respectable elderly gentleman.&#xD;
We are happy to state for his sake, that on the&#xD;
morrow the theory of the wounded bird was&#xD;
opportunely discovered, eagerly accepted, and&#xD;
minutely followed up by him. Nay we can say,&#xD;
restored to joy, he even saw in it an allegorical&#xD;
meaning.&#xD;
CHAPTER LIII&#xD;
MR. ]BEEKMAN MAKES THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MR.&#xD;
BOTTLEWASHER.&#xD;
MR. BEERMAN-nBOUTS was an individual of that&#xD;
enviable temperament which is rarely thrown&#xD;
from its balance by the difficulties of its possess-&#xD;
or, to say nothing of those of others. Whether&#xD;
this was because the sanguineness of his nature&#xD;
was greater than his perspicacity, or whether the&#xD;
latter was not very lucid in its effects, it was&#xD;
nevertheless true that his equanimity was rarely&#xD;
disturbed. To be sure, he might be observed at&#xD;
times nursing his whiskers with a serious air,&#xD;
but that may.have been as much the result of a&#xD;
noble reliance upon their power as of any thing&#xD;
else. He thus smiled complacently upon the fa-&#xD;
vor which Miss De Pompenkops seemed disposed&#xD;
to bestow upon Mr. Toplady at the picnic, and&#xD;
which, it was quite evident, she did bestow upon&#xD;
him subsequent to it. The time, which he was&#xD;
wont to expend in sitting in silent satisfaction by&#xD;
her side, he now tranquilly consumed in frequent&#xD;
resorts to the arms of Somnus, or in smoking a&#xD;
segar in lazy pedestrianism upon the numerous&#xD;
walks of the surrounding park. It should not&#xD;
be inferred that he did not ratiocinate upon the&#xD;
adjustment of proper means to any end in hand,&#xD;
for he undoubtedly did this. But his weakness&#xD;
lay rather in his confidence that if he did not&#xD;
possess such means, fortune would be sure to&#xD;
bestow them upon him.&#xD;
It was on a bright afternoon,  day or two&#xD;
after the picnic, that, from the warmness of the&#xD;
weather, he had betaken himself to a shady&#xD;
bower in the gardens, with a paper of cigarittos&#xD;
and a French novel, there to pass an hour upon&#xD;
.his back, in lazily titillating his fancy, or watching&#xD;
in sleepy nonchalance the wreaths of smoke&#xD;
&#xD;
twirling from his lips. He had been there but a&#xD;
few moments, and was blinking in sympathetic&#xD;
amusement at a bright-eyed toad, hopping about&#xD;
the bower, while he was silently debating whether&#xD;
he should light another segar or not, when he&#xD;
heard the noise of footsteps upon the gravel, and&#xD;
of conversation, in a by-walk which ran across&#xD;
the park at a short distance from. his retreat.&#xD;
He immediately recognized one of the voices to&#xD;
be that of the illustrious Chevalier St. Beaut6&#xD;
and the other that of a female, who appeared to&#xD;
be laboring under some little womanly excitation&#xD;
of feeling, which the gentleman was evidently&#xD;
endeavoring by his conversational eloquence to&#xD;
assuage. Eavesdropping was an action the gen-&#xD;
tlemanly Beekman naturally scorned, and he rose&#xD;
to a sitting posture for the purpose of at once&#xD;
disclosing his propinquity to the new-comers,&#xD;
when he was astonished to observe that the fe-&#xD;
male was one of the maids of the house. Under&#xD;
such circumstances he did not feel himself bound&#xD;
to move at all, except to at once hide himself in&#xD;
the most artful manner he could. What was the&#xD;
conversation he heard, or were the actions he ob-&#xD;
served, it is not necessary for us to state, it being&#xD;
sufficient to remark that after an apparently eatl*-&#xD;
factory result to both parties, the maid tripped&#xD;
back hastily, by a somewhat circuitous path, to&#xD;
the house. Mr. Beekman immediately emerged&#xD;
from his shady covert, and following the diplo-&#xD;
mat, who was already sauntering back, humming&#xD;
a lively air, exclaimed authoritatively:&#xD;
" Here, sir. Stop your singing, sir, and come&#xD;
here!"&#xD;
"Stop my singing! eh?  Are you addressing&#xD;
me, sir ?" exclaimed the young diplomatist, mani-&#xD;
festing great astonishment, as he turned hastily&#xD;
around and observed the other.&#xD;
"Yes, you rascal !" replied the latter.&#xD;
" Perhaps you would be pleased to moderate&#xD;
your expressions. It is a tone, sir, to which I&#xD;
am not habituated ! Not at all, sir!" said the&#xD;
diplomatist.&#xD;
"Not habituated! You rascally fellow, I have&#xD;
heard all V"&#xD;
"And what am I to infer from that, sir ?"&#xD;
asked the diplomatist immediately.&#xD;
"I know all, I repeat to you; and I have the&#xD;
intention of knocking you down. Now I think&#xD;
of it, I remember seeing you as hall-waiter at Mr.&#xD;
Barclay's !"&#xD;
"It wasn't me !" said the other.&#xD;
"Brazen-faced rascal!"&#xD;
"He may have been, but it wasn't me I"&#xD;
"Rascal! Do you mean to say you didn't an-&#xD;
swer the bell there ?"&#xD;
" I never answered at all."&#xD;
" I have no doubt of that, you scoundrel.&#xD;
But listen to me, Bottlewasher; I will not knock&#xD;
you down.   I will expose you, and stop your&#xD;
confounded disguised career."&#xD;
" It is my diplomatic talent. I have a genius&#xD;
for it. You can't choke off genius !"&#xD;
"Diplomatic talent!  Well, you have impu-&#xD;
dence enough, that is true !" said- Mr. Beek-&#xD;
man.&#xD;
"I will employ that talent in your favor! I&#xD;
know your relations here ! I've seen how your&#xD;
pot boils as well as mine !"&#xD;
" Eh, sir ? Here, take yourself off. No,&#xD;
stay," continued Mr. Beekman. " Fortune has&#xD;
sent me this fellow. By Jove, he can tell me&#xD;

&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD.                     121&#xD;
&#xD;
" Good God, no!t Why, what does this mean ?"&#xD;
-continued the excited Toplady, jumping upon the&#xD;
back ledge and rummaging earnestly about.&#xD;
" Ha ! ha! Some of our friends at the house&#xD;
are around here with 'em!" conjectured Mr.&#xD;
Mills dubiously.  "Hello! Winkfield! Titman !"&#xD;
There was no answer, except by the echoes&#xD;
from the neighboring mountain, which soon died&#xD;
away on their attentive hearing.&#xD;
"1I say, Titman, Moses, this is no joke at all.&#xD;
Come here. We are catching cold," cried Mr.&#xD;
Toplady pettishly. "Not funny at all!"&#xD;
The summons was of no use, nor were the re-'&#xD;
petitions thereof, nor the renewed and prolonged&#xD;
searching of both the bathers.&#xD;
"1O dear !" said Mr. Toplady, pausing in his&#xD;
anxiety, as the too probable truth struck upon&#xD;
his mind. "Some scoundrel of a foot-pad has&#xD;
stolen them! He hasn't even left 'the shirts.&#xD;
They-they might be of some-"&#xD;
" It is dreadful. What shall we do ?" inquired&#xD;
Mr. Mills, beginning to shiver.&#xD;
"God knows," replied Mr. Toplady, staring at&#xD;
the opposite shore. It was, indeed, a" difficult&#xD;
position to be extricated from by human reason-&#xD;
ing. The sun was sinking behind the bills. If&#xD;
they staid there, they would run the hazard of&#xD;
freezing to death. They could not go home in&#xD;
the predicament they were in, and if they at-&#xD;
tempted to seek the road to accost passers-by for&#xD;
assistance, they might run the risk of exposing&#xD;
themselves before they could properly retreat.0&#xD;
" Whoever you are that have taken these&#xD;
clothes," cried Mr. Toplady indefinitely, "if you&#xD;
will leave them where you are, and designate the&#xD;
spot, you may take all the change there is in the&#xD;
pockets, and the watch too, the rascal! It is an&#xD;
old silver one."&#xD;
" I left mine on mydressing'-case, luckily," said&#xD;
Mr. Mills.                        k&#xD;
The generous offer, and the entreating tone&#xD;
thereof, were alike lost on the hardened offender,&#xD;
if he was still in the neighborhood.  The only&#xD;
thing remaining for them to do was to cautiously&#xD;
approach the road, mount into a tree thereon,&#xD;
and hail the first passer-by that came along.&#xD;
With some difficulty from the rough bushes,&#xD;
briers, and thorns, they succeeded in reaching the&#xD;
road, and both at once mounted into a -maple-&#xD;
tree, and concealed themselves in the foliage, to&#xD;
await the coming of some traveler. It was not a&#xD;
highway, and the chances were against their&#xD;
seeing any one at all.- For full half an hour they&#xD;
waited in gloomy, desperate silence. At last the&#xD;
joyful sound of an approaching wagon fell on&#xD;
their ears. The vehicle camPe in sight. 0n its&#xD;
front-seat was an honest farmer, returnig from&#xD;
Chester, and on the back were two yoing fe-&#xD;
males, his daughters, without doubt, talking to-&#xD;
gether.&#xD;
" 0 gracious I how unlucky I" said Mr. Top-&#xD;
lady, in a low but energetic tone. - "Confound&#xD;
the deuced women! Always the way with these&#xD;
country girls, riding about when they should be&#xD;
at home attending to their business V"&#xD;
This speech was apparently very ungallant, but&#xD;
it was caused by the very fact of his respect for&#xD;
the sex amounting to timidity. Thus the vehicle&#xD;
rolled'past to a short distance, ere he summoned&#xD;
up enough courage to give a subdued yell to stop&#xD;
its driver. The latter looked around as if he had&#xD;
heard something, butV the rapid continuance of&#xD;
&#xD;
the vehicle on its course rendered useless a repe-&#xD;
tition of the call.&#xD;
"Perhaps it is best he didn't discover us,"&#xD;
said Mr. Toplady, after a moment's silence. And&#xD;
again they waited. Their chances were not all&#xD;
gone yet. Soon two little boys came along the&#xD;
road with fishing-poles in their hands.  They&#xD;
had evidently been fishing in the stream above.&#xD;
They could probably give the unlucky bathers&#xD;
some information respecting the missing clothes,&#xD;
or could be induced to procure assistance for&#xD;
them.&#xD;
" Hallo, boys I" cried Mr. Toplady distinctly,&#xD;
at the proper moment.&#xD;
" HeyI What do you warnt ?" said the boys,&#xD;
stopping in an astonished manner. "Where are&#xD;
ye ?"&#xD;
"Here, in the maple-tree V" replied Mr. Mills.&#xD;
The boys approached and looked up. The&#xD;
objects which they saw there, were evidently&#xD;
such as possessed to their youthful minds the&#xD;
wild appearance of the traditional " crazy&#xD;
men," for they dropped their poles immediately&#xD;
and fled upon the wings of terror down the road,&#xD;
until out of sight.&#xD;
" The little fools I What were they scared at ?&#xD;
o dear! it is of no use!" cried Mr. Toplady.&#xD;
" Yes, it is. Cheer up I" answered Mr. Mills.&#xD;
" The sun is away down. It will be dark soon,&#xD;
and then we can go back to the house, or to the&#xD;
farmer's on the other side of the stream."&#xD;
It was the only prospect left them. They&#xD;
waited three-quarters of an hour until the dusky&#xD;
shades of evening began to prevail, and then&#xD;
commenced to wend their way through the woods&#xD;
and bushes, by the side of the road, not toward&#xD;
the farmer's, as they were afraid of his dogs, but&#xD;
to the Wagbull mansion itself. By crossing the&#xD;
rivulet, they could penetrate the thick grove&#xD;
adjoining the gardens, and by crossing the latter,&#xD;
reach the rear-court, and the servants' staircase,&#xD;
and by this they might with due caution gain&#xD;
their chambers without being seen.  Fortune&#xD;
appeared to favor them, though at some expense&#xD;
of their cuticle.&#xD;
They succeeded in reaching the domestics'&#xD;
staircase without observation.&#xD;
" I guess they are not through dinner yet,"&#xD;
said Mr. Toplady softly. "Go as still as you&#xD;
can."&#xD;
Mr. Toplady was right. They had not finished&#xD;
the dinner, nor even commenced it yet, for&#xD;
they were awaiting the arrival of the tardy in-&#xD;
dividuals themselves. Mr. Mills's apartment was&#xD;
in the front of the third story, directly over Mr.&#xD;
Toplady's in thesecond. They were both obliged&#xD;
to pass'the main staircase.  It was best for both&#xD;
to seek at once Mr. Toplady's room. With one&#xD;
dash, they ran along the ball, to pass the stairs,&#xD;
and-it was very, extremely unfortunate, indeed,&#xD;
but-just as they reached the latter, the dignified&#xD;
Miss Do Pompenkops and the lovely Bessie came&#xD;
tripping up the same, with their arms around each&#xD;
other's waists, to make a hasty preparation for&#xD;
~dinner, which had finally been ordered. The&#xD;
sight to their bewildered vision was that of fright-&#xD;
ful madness, of frenzied lunacy! There were two&#xD;
wretched, insensate creatures, with desperate&#xD;
countenances, tearing along in delirious rivalry,&#xD;
and jostling each other in their frantic career.&#xD;
Miss Wagbull shrunk back against the wall for&#xD;
support, while Miss De Pompenkops sank in ap-&#xD;

CHAPTER LVI.&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD AND MR. LAMPSON DINE WITH&#xD;
MR. BARNARD. MR. WINKFIELD THE NEXT DAY&#xD;
PAYS A. VISIT TO THE SCHOLAR'S VILLA IN&#xD;
wESTCHESTER.&#xD;
SHORTLY after the return to the city, Mr. Bar.&#xD;
nard called upon Mr. Winkfield, and informed&#xD;
him that he had just emerged from the Museum,&#xD;
which he had felt it his duty to visit under the&#xD;
influence of the country feelings he had contract-&#xD;
ed in New-England; that he had duly seen the&#xD;
Happy Family, the wax figures, including that of&#xD;
the Playful Haberdasher, who murdered his wife&#xD;
and six children, biting off the head of the infant;&#xD;
and also the other curiosities, according to the&#xD;
catalogue, comprising tb mud-fish.&#xD;
"I picked up a curiosity in the Park, too, a&#xD;
singular genius. An indignant literary bully in&#xD;
india-rubbers, who had just been in a difficulty in&#xD;
the Copy-right office about its foreign arraige-&#xD;
ments, and been put out of it. He took my fancy&#xD;
and I did his, because I offered to clean out the&#xD;
establishment for him; and because I resembled,&#xD;
he said, what his friend Bancroft, the historian,&#xD;
used to be, according to the miniatures, at the&#xD;
close of the last century. Bully for B3ancroft !&#xD;
The india-rubber. man is going to dine with me&#xD;
this evening, and I think I will make it an extra-&#xD;
ordinary spread, in honor of our safe return to&#xD;
the white settlements. I want you, Mr. Toplady,&#xD;
and little Tit!",&#xD;
Mr., Toplady was absent at a Norwich Electric&#xD;
Institute, having concluded to try the efficacy of&#xD;
Connecticut lightning, instead of Massachusetts&#xD;
water, for his infirmity of spirit, and Mr. Titman&#xD;
had been most mysteriously missing the entire&#xD;
day.&#xD;
SWell, you come. With the aid of the copy-&#xD;
right man you and I can manage it," replied Mr.&#xD;
Barnard. E8                   i   P       -&#xD;
Upon reaching the latter's rooms in the even-&#xD;
-ing Moses found that the banquet was extraordi-&#xD;
nary, both in quantity and quality, that the mar-&#xD;
kets had been ransacked for the material, ad&#xD;
the Maison Dorde had deputed its finest intellect&#xD;
&#xD;
NKFIELD.                                 123&#xD;
for the preparation. le was surprised to hear&#xD;
the name of Numhead mentioned as he entered,&#xD;
and gratified to find that Mr. Barnard's curiosity&#xD;
was the eccentric scholar of the Archmological&#xD;
Library, Mr. -Lampson.  The latter appeared&#xD;
thinner and more care-worn than ever, which Mo-&#xD;
ses attributed to close application during the&#xD;
summer in the preparation of the great work. le&#xD;
nevertheless seemed highly inspirited by the&#xD;
doubly-agreeable sight of the banquet and Moses,&#xD;
and when the ceremonies were commenced, paid&#xD;
an impartial attention to both, as the most cour.&#xD;
teous method of signifying his eminent satisfac-&#xD;
tion at the hospitality of Mr. Barndrd. When&#xD;
Moses in a neat speech proposed their host's&#xD;
health, characterizing him as a manly, amusing,&#xD;
instructive and hospitable friend, Mr. Lampson in&#xD;
a loud voice applauded every epithet, and when&#xD;
that of hospitable was mentioned, cheered vigor-&#xD;
ously, and sent his plate around for another bird&#xD;
with iereased enthusiasm. He seemed for the&#xD;
moment to have thrown off his literary dignity,&#xD;
and while enjoying the pleasures of the board,&#xD;
endeavored to repay them by a social use of his&#xD;
muse. Clio brought out ber unwritten records,&#xD;
and secret anecdotes of the great struggle for&#xD;
American liberty; many being such as had never&#xD;
been divulged to the public ,upon the printed&#xD;
page, and many such as could not well be, on ac-&#xD;
count of Mrs. Boffin. Our hero joined in, and&#xD;
sang the inflexible virtue of the founders of na-&#xD;
tions and endeavored to show that the more a&#xD;
community knew of civilization and the amenities&#xD;
of life, the more profligate it became. le was&#xD;
occupied with a heavy quotation, from the fifth&#xD;
chapter of Sir Thomas More, highly applicable to&#xD;
thigh point,.when le was interrupted by a slight&#xD;
altercation between the host and the scholar.&#xD;
"Take one of these pat6s," said the former,&#xD;
as Mr. Lampson manifested a relaxation of his&#xD;
prandial vigor.&#xD;
"Oh ! no. No more."&#xD;
"lavd some of the pickled oysters, then," said&#xD;
the host.&#xD;
"Oh! no. I think I have done enough. I can't!&#xD;
replied the guest.&#xD;
"But you shall," insisted the host.&#xD;
"No, sir. I don't wish to."&#xD;
What you don't wish to! I won't have any&#xD;
of that nonsense. Take 'em," continued the host&#xD;
excitedly. "Here, John1"&#xD;
- I positively decline. I will not have them,"&#xD;
said Mr. Lampson, bawling at the top of his voice&#xD;
under the pressure of self-defense.&#xD;
- D-n it! I'll see whether you will or not !1&#xD;
said the host ferociously.&#xD;
"Very well, then. i11 try one or two more I"&#xD;
replied the unhappy historian. And to hide his&#xD;
growing incapacity from the sensitive host, he&#xD;
signed to pick at the bivalves, and commenced&#xD;
another little higtorival anecdote. While he went&#xD;
oi, now emulating the heroes lie was talking&#xD;
about, and making history instead of chronicling&#xD;
it, Mr. Barnard plied him with wine, that his flag-&#xD;
ging appetite might be revived, and at the sanie&#xD;
time generously kept ahead of him to cheer him&#xD;
Thereupon, in amicable return, the scholai- in-&#xD;
formed them of his own nice tastes ui) the art of&#xD;
eating, of the recherchi6 little dinners lhe was ac-&#xD;
custoined now atnd then to give at the snug box&#xD;
at Westchester, and expressed a strong desire&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7256-00000063"/>&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD-&#xD;
&#xD;
that both Moses and Mr. Barnard should speedily (&#xD;
do him and his wife the honor to assist at one ofT&#xD;
these quiet affairs.               -&#xD;
During the progress of the banquet and whenI&#xD;
all were quite busily engaged with the various&#xD;
delicacies before them, Moses incidentally noticed&#xD;
a most curious action upon the part of the schol-&#xD;
ar, which he held was undoubtedly to be attrib-&#xD;
uted to the eccentricity of genius, under the in-&#xD;
fluence of social mirth  He saw him at a certain&#xD;
point glance furtively about the room, and then&#xD;
suddenly slip into his pocket a woodcock fromI&#xD;
big plate. Presently, three Fren6h rolls adroitlyI&#xD;
followed, and shortly afterward, during the tem-&#xD;
porary absence of the waiter, the half of a chicken&#xD;
mysteriously disappeared from before the scholars&#xD;
and undoubtedly flew to the nest of the wood-&#xD;
cock. Though this pleasantry was frequently&#xD;
repeated with other substantial articles, at various&#xD;
stages of the banquet thereafter, Moses conjec-&#xD;
tured it to be the preliminary arrangement of some&#xD;
magical trick, which the genius -purposed perform-&#xD;
ing during the evening, and went on with his own&#xD;
share of the festivity. For the seventh time in&#xD;
his worldly career, our herp attempted to smoke&#xD;
after the dessert, and the effect of this effort with&#xD;
that of the champagne, of the boisterous hilarity&#xD;
of the host, and of the learned disquisitions of&#xD;
the disciple of history, made the scene somewhat&#xD;
indistinct for a while.&#xD;
"I'll tell you what let's do,"exclaimed Barnard&#xD;
with a rather thick utterance. "Let's change&#xD;
coats, go into the street, and have a lark. You&#xD;
take mine, Winkfield; I'll take Lampson's ; and&#xD;
Lampson can take yours !"&#xD;
"No, no," interposed the scholar, starting ner-&#xD;
vously. "Never, sir, never  I'll consent to go&#xD;
into the street, but not to change coats. It is not&#xD;
dignified, sir. Never! sir."&#xD;
As Moses at once sustained the scholar, the&#xD;
affable host did not press the proposition, but in&#xD;
amicable revenge compelled the latter to drink&#xD;
another glass of wine Mr. Lampson did so, and&#xD;
presently consented to another. Very shortly he&#xD;
agreed to a third, and thereupon insisted upon a&#xD;
large number more in rapid succession, until he&#xD;
was finally inhabilitated- from an erect posture, or&#xD;
a proper view of historical and other mundane&#xD;
things. It was not remarkable, therefore, that,&#xD;
at this point, he should indiscriminately attempt&#xD;
to put bottles of wine, plates, knives, forks, and&#xD;
other articles openly and violently into his pocket,&#xD;
He seemed also to be suddenly possessed with&#xD;
the idea that Mr. Barnard had been for a long&#xD;
period the enemy of his children, and indistinctly&#xD;
called upon Moses to contrast the ease and lux-&#xD;
ury of that gentleman with their want and misery.&#xD;
He also took into his head the singular idea of&#xD;
alluding to the banquet and to his host's unbound-&#xD;
ed hospitality, in terms of quite furious disap-&#xD;
proval, and ejaculated repeatedly from his sofa&#xD;
sugh strong expressions as "D-n his dinner!&#xD;
D-n his salad !" etc., until incapacitated from&#xD;
saying any thing at all.&#xD;
Mr. Barnard, observing his condition, proposed&#xD;
to Moses that they should murder him "for a&#xD;
lark." But after a considerable discussion, im&#xD;
which Moses showed that he was rapidly be-&#xD;
coming infected, with the slang phrases of the&#xD;
day, they left him gently slumbering upon the&#xD;
sofa, and sallied together into the street. Our&#xD;
hero had subsequently an imdistinct remembrance&#xD;
&#xD;
of attending, among other scenes, the cere-&#xD;
monies of a midnight baptism, in a temple of&#xD;
high-church proclivities, of being compelled by&#xD;
Mr. Barnard to accompany him to the font,&#xD;
among the number of the confirmed, and of that&#xD;
gentleman's coming away therefrom with the im-&#xD;
pression that he had been shampooed. We will&#xD;
not dwell upon the remorse and shame of our&#xD;
hero, upon endeavoring in vain to find, unaided,&#xD;
the key-hole of his door at a later hour. Suffice&#xD;
it to say, his faithful servitor, Brunswick, did so&#xD;
for him, and also held his bed,,util he was ena-&#xD;
bled to place himself upon it, and sink into&#xD;
oblivion.I&#xD;
The next morning, the first thoughts which oc-&#xD;
cupied him, were those which the previous night's&#xD;
society with the historical scholar gave rise to.&#xD;
He remembered the impression he had received&#xD;
during the progress of the banquet, despite the&#xD;
scholar's vivacious air, and boasting references&#xD;
to the convivial appliances of his own home, that&#xD;
there frequently appeared an expression upon&#xD;
his countenance, indicative of the mental agony,&#xD;
which results from a very keen consciousness of&#xD;
the rigors of poverty. His ddd allusion to the&#xD;
misery of his family, and his singular acts in&#xD;
pocketing articles of food from the table, now&#xD;
received in Moses's mind a harrowing solution.&#xD;
Could it be that his family, his wife and little&#xD;
ones, were suffering at that moment, that they&#xD;
even needed those articles? Moses reviewed&#xD;
his antecedents, and considered the struggling&#xD;
life, the traditional poverty and pride of literary&#xD;
characters. With fervent restlessness, he break-&#xD;
fasted, hastily repaired to Mr. Barnard's dwelling,&#xD;
aqd to the library, but finding the scholar at&#xD;
neither of these places, resolved to satisfy his&#xD;
generous impulses by seeking him at his home in&#xD;
Westchester.&#xD;
.He soon reached Harlem, and in that pic.&#xD;
iuresque suburb, was directed to the butcher, as-&#xD;
one most likely to be favored with a knowledge&#xD;
of Mr. Lampson's residence.0&#xD;
" Lampson! It's the leg-of-mutton man i"&#xD;
said the butcher's man, jogging, the latter's&#xD;
memory. "Don't you know he said his name&#xD;
was that? I remember it from its sounding like&#xD;
sheep, I mean lambs!"&#xD;
Upon further inquiry Moses discovered that&#xD;
the scholar occasionally bought a leg of mutton&#xD;
there, and did it with such an overwhelming air&#xD;
of patronage, and took it off with him with such&#xD;
apparent fear of its not reaching its destination,&#xD;
that he had become inseparably and facetiously&#xD;
associated in the assistant butcher's mind with&#xD;
-that article of food.&#xD;
"We run our carts up that way sometimes,&#xD;
boss. Yes, I knows where he liveth, my lord !"&#xD;
replied the butcher.  And after Moses had&#xD;
received from that prolixious immolator, almost&#xD;
confusig direction, in which highways, and cross-&#xD;
roads, and lanes, and corner-lots, and bridges,&#xD;
and "Mr. Johnsonses country-seat, and Mr.&#xD;
Smithses country-seat," were incoherently mixed&#xD;
up. he started off, and at once penetrated the&#xD;
wilds of Westchester. It was a pleasant day,&#xD;
and that, with the vehemence of his purpose,&#xD;
dissipated the fatigue which would otherwise&#xD;
have resulted from the numerous mistakes which&#xD;
he made in the course of his search. He wan-&#xD;
dered about in a country which was all Mr.&#xD;
Lampson had described it--well stocked with&#xD;
&#xD;
124&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD-&#xD;
&#xD;
still-born cities, geese, and retired German shoe-&#xD;
makers.&#xD;
"Where does this road lead, my friend ?" said&#xD;
he to one of these intelligent beings, as he ap-&#xD;
proached a hill.&#xD;
" Up de hill !"&#xD;
" Where does this road lead, my friend ?" said&#xD;
he to another whom he met upon the apex of the&#xD;
acclivity.&#xD;
"Down de hill I"&#xD;
Another undertook to direct him to Mr.&#xD;
Thompson's country-seat, by employing as land.&#xD;
marks a flock of geese, a man with a red head,&#xD;
" a field mit some drees," "and Mrs. Meyer, de&#xD;
vooman vot's zeek mit de leetle shild." At the&#xD;
High Bridge, its keeper, after a concentrated&#xD;
moment of disgust, pity, scorn, and rage, because&#xD;
he had not come expressly to examine that cele-&#xD;

seated to point out to him from it, the coun-&#xD;
try-seat of Mr. Thompson, peeping through the&#xD;
trees a half-mile beyond. Moses soon approached&#xD;
this splendid mansion, and entered the beautiful&#xD;
and elaborately ltid-out grounds, which sur-&#xD;
rounded it. There was a party of ladies and gen-&#xD;
tlemen upon its balcony, and as lie descried among&#xD;
them one or two. extremely interesting young&#xD;
ladies, it was natural that he should assume as digni-&#xD;
fied a demeanor as possible in approaching them.&#xD;
"They have evidently.caught sight of me,"&#xD;
thought he. He was quite correct. Not only&#xD;
had they observed him, but a large black dog,&#xD;
lying at an adjacent stable, had remarked his en-&#xD;
trance, and proceeded at once to resent it as an&#xD;
unwarrantable intrusion. As he had no stick&#xD;
with him, he very properly ran ,at the approach&#xD;
of this animal. And after he had once com-&#xD;
menced that rapid method of locomotion, it was,&#xD;
of course, unwise to distract his energy by at-&#xD;
tempting to select a particular path for his&#xD;
course. He therefore continued to career for&#xD;
some moments in various ones, within view of&#xD;
the balcony, and pursued by the irrepressible&#xD;
dog, who was accompanied in the excitement of&#xD;
the chase by another and smaller one, who had&#xD;
started simultaneously from the balcony. Final-&#xD;
ly the dogs overtook him, and while the poodle&#xD;
stood by and barked violently at him, the honest&#xD;
watch-dog inserted his teeth in his pantaloons,&#xD;
and held him in a very awkward position, until&#xD;
he was released by a servant, amid the excite-&#xD;
ment and perhaps ill-concealed merriment of the&#xD;
witnesses of the pursuit.&#xD;
"Never mind touching your hat," said he has-&#xD;
tily to the polite domestic. "Hold him, or he&#xD;
will come at me again!"&#xD;
The proprietor of the mansion came up and&#xD;
angrily ordered the dogs to be taken off and&#xD;
whipped.&#xD;
"Oh 1 nolsir I I beg of you not," said Moses,&#xD;
magnanimously, as the traces of his indignation&#xD;
faded away at the apologies of the gentleman,&#xD;
who asked him toward the house.&#xD;
" They think you are a tramper !" said the&#xD;
gentleman-.&#xD;
" Yes, I am somewhat dusty,"' replied Moses&#xD;
smiling, " and after all, they only did their duty,&#xD;
you know."&#xD;
"Butt the gentleman does not for all that wish&#xD;
to he exposed to fears of hydrophobia," sympa-&#xD;
thetically interposed a young lady, evidently tak-&#xD;
en with Moses's manners-.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Oh ! never mind that. 1 am not at all afraid&#xD;
of that," replied the gallant Moses, laughing.&#xD;
"This is a very intelligent young gentleman,&#xD;
Thorne," said a red-nosed man seated near. "He's&#xD;
not fool enough to be afraid of hydrophobia.&#xD;
Neither am I. Lief have it as not !"&#xD;
He was no doubt sincere, for from appear-&#xD;
ances he had had it all his life, that is, as far&#xD;
as antipathy to water was concerned. "Take a&#xD;
glass of wine," said he. And as our hero cour-&#xD;
teously accepted, he immediately advanced still&#xD;
further in the estimation of this personage. He&#xD;
was much surprised to find that the possessor of&#xD;
such wealth and magnificence did not know who&#xD;
were his neighbors, for it was only through the&#xD;
hitherto latent knowledge of a servant that the&#xD;
scholar's home was discovered to be near by.&#xD;
After politely finishing the agreeable episode.&#xD;
Moses sought Lampson's residence, and found it&#xD;
amid a grove of trees. Lampson had certainly&#xD;
been right, he thought, in preferring the fresh&#xD;
air of the country to the stifling, mephitic atmos-&#xD;
phere of a city garret, even if the house was&#xD;
somewhat dilapidated. For the sake of the schol-&#xD;
ar's pride, he determined to reconnoitre before&#xD;
he entered. The road wound toward it, and there&#xD;
was a little hedge which divided Its garden from&#xD;
a large field. He concluded to secrete himself&#xD;
behind this hedge. Mr. Lampson and his wife&#xD;
were seated together upon a small front portico.&#xD;
The husband took the hand of his wife, as she&#xD;
refrained for the moment from her work. The&#xD;
sadness of poverty was too evident in her smile&#xD;
and the bitterness in his manner.&#xD;
" Louisa, I might complete the book at once,&#xD;
but I must be thorough. It needs only one or&#xD;
two important facts to be decided, and then the&#xD;
world shall have it !" said he.&#xD;
" And have you determined which publisher&#xD;
shall have it ?" asked the wife anxiously.&#xD;
"No, not yet. I intend. to receive proposals&#xD;
from them first, and then impartially decide.&#xD;
Some must be disappointed," said the scholar,&#xD;
and an air of pity spread over the infatuated&#xD;
gentleman's face.&#xD;
"But that can not be helped, Joseph," replied&#xD;
the wife. "I would not let that trouble me !"&#xD;
'I think I will confine any arrangement I&#xD;
make with them to the first fifty editions. After&#xD;
the first fifty thousand I certainly ought to have&#xD;
better terms," continued the scholar in pleased&#xD;
meditation.&#xD;
"Certainly. Think of the labor and care you&#xD;
have bestowed upon it !" said the wife.  "But,&#xD;
Joseph, had not you better decide quickly who&#xD;
shall have it, and then you know you can per-&#xD;
haps procure a sum in advance upon it !"&#xD;
" My dear, it shall be finished immediately$ I&#xD;
Yes, and my own Louisa shall work no more I"&#xD;
continued the husband rather savagely. ".No&#xD;
more figers aching, and no more eyes aching!"&#xD;
"It'is not for me, Joey I" said the wife, glanc-&#xD;
ing sadly at the two boys, who had built a mag-&#xD;
nificent palace in the sand, and were just then&#xD;
engaged in celebrating its completion by a grand&#xD;
dinner at its side, on a fragment of crockery&#xD;
and two chips.&#xD;
"Wife! you too shall have daily the very&#xD;
best food which Delmonico can give ! You shall&#xD;
have course after course. You shall be all day&#xD;
at the table !" continued the husband in the&#xD;
wildness of his bitterness. " You shall have new&#xD;

lis own way, and delicately permitted him to en.&#xD;
joy the solitude which he wished to cherish. But&#xD;
a few days of this arrangement had elapsed, how-&#xD;
ever, when her attention was attracted one after&#xD;
noon to his chamber, by the extraordinary pecu&#xD;
hiarity of the stifled sounds which she heard&#xD;
emanating therefrom. They appeared to be of a&#xD;
devotional nature, but still did not seem to par-&#xD;
take at all of either the calm intensity, or rational&#xD;
enthusiasm, which members of the Christian.com-&#xD;
munity are accustomed to manifest in their re-&#xD;
ligious exercises. On the contrary, uncouth sup-&#xD;
plications for the favor of some superior being,&#xD;
seemed eccentrically mingled with entreaties to the&#xD;
same to eat, to drink, to make rain, and to destroy,&#xD;
and with expressions of joy at the apparent grati-&#xD;
fication thereof; or with notes of despair at the&#xD;
imagined refusal. Then again the votary ap-&#xD;
peared to be engaged in a prolonged dance about&#xD;
the chamber, and incoherent defiances to enemies&#xD;
in war and animals were uttered in tones of des-&#xD;
perate joy.  These ceremonies were interspersed&#xD;
with frequent musical appliances, in the rude&#xD;
beating of some small instrument like a dull un-&#xD;
resonant drum, or the expression of short and&#xD;
barbarous songs in an unintelligible tongue. Take&#xD;
them all in all, the sounds seemed more the result&#xD;
of some uncivilized being engaged in the savage&#xD;
worship of a diabolical god, than those which&#xD;
should inspire the upright Christian in the sacred&#xD;
exercise of his devotions. With startled emotions,'&#xD;
the humble yet honest believer in the sublime&#xD;
doctrines of civilization crept cautiously to the&#xD;
door of the chamber above, and there was enabled&#xD;
to observe, by means of the keyhole, a sight&#xD;
which shocked her being with mingled sensations&#xD;
of terror and Christian indignation. In the mid-&#xD;
dle of the room, a small but hideous image of&#xD;
wood, of frightful, fiendish features, stared with&#xD;
carved ferocity into vacancy. A string of beads&#xD;
hung around its neck. An old coat and bed-&#xD;
blanket draped its body and lower features, while&#xD;
its head was surmounted with what the observer&#xD;
recognized as the remains of one of her old straw-&#xD;
bonnets, divested of its front and placed in a&#xD;
cocked position. Upon the top of this was stuck,&#xD;
in grotesque irregularity, a single feather, which&#xD;
had evidently been lately torn by the devotee&#xD;
from the tail of the stately male fowl of the premi-&#xD;
ses, for the adornment of his horrible divinity.&#xD;
The infatuated heathen, after all the varied con-&#xD;
tact with believers in the Christian world, and all&#xD;
their sublime teachings, it was plain, still adhered,&#xD;
even at this late moment of his existence, to the&#xD;
belief in the god of his African boyhood, and the&#xD;
mystic Mumbo Jumbo had in Christendom at least&#xD;
one other lucid worshiper, besides Dr. Pusey and&#xD;
his disciples.&#xD;
" You eat. You make de rain. Borriboo, kina&#xD;
bomba! kina bomba !    What for you no eat,&#xD;
you dam rascal? I make you eat. Tongo kin-&#xD;
Iiieum squattux! You like um drink better ?'&#xD;
Very well, you drink dis time !" continued the&#xD;
heathen, who bad boon worked up by this pre-&#xD;
ference of the deity into a frenzy of mingled ex-&#xD;
postulation and entreaty.&#xD;
After a muttered incantation, accompanied by&#xD;
a short tattoo upon the band-box, which heheld&#xD;
in his hand, the wretched Ethiopian placed a&#xD;
bottle at the mouth of the deity with beseeching&#xD;
entreaty, and was in the act of putting it to his&#xD;
own, when the excited eye-witness. in all the&#xD;
&#xD;
- stoutness of her Christianity, burst into the room,&#xD;
t pushed the fragile worshiper from the hideous&#xD;
- embodiment of his hopes, pushed over the latter,&#xD;
- and ended by throwing it out of the window,&#xD;
- blanket, bonnet and all.&#xD;
" Well, that is the most extraordinary thing I&#xD;
ever heard of!'" cried our hero, who had been lis-&#xD;
- tening in wrapt astonishment to the recital of his&#xD;
domestic.  "It certainly is a most astonishing&#xD;
and unheard of proceeding !"&#xD;
" An't it, sir ?" continued Brunswick. "The&#xD;
old man couldn't do nothin'. He's so thin-shank-&#xD;
ed, sir, he once broke his leg, putting' on his pan-&#xD;
taloons."&#xD;
" But what has your mother done since ?" in-&#xD;
quired Moses. "Does she keep him there still ?"&#xD;
" Oh ! no, sir," replied Brunswick. "She tus-&#xD;
sled with him, and took him off at once to the&#xD;
police office, but findin' she couldn't do nothin'&#xD;
with him there, she handed him   over to. the&#xD;
deacons of Shiloh. There's a great row in the&#xD;
church, sir, about it. A meeting next week has&#xD;
been got up to convert him, and all the members&#xD;
are to be there. Lommeydew says it is the only&#xD;
Way to save him1!"&#xD;
"Upon my word, Brunswick," continued Moses,&#xD;
"I-I should like extremely to be there.   I&#xD;
would indeed !"&#xD;
" And you can be, sir," replied the domestic.&#xD;
"There'll'not be many white folks there, but I&#xD;
will show you a good seat."&#xD;
"I shall not intrude, shall I, Brunswick ?"&#xD;
asked Moses.&#xD;
" Oh ! no, sir. There's a good place in the gal-&#xD;
lery, behind the organ.  Only you had better&#xD;
come alone, perhaps," said the domestic, delicate-&#xD;
ly referring to the likely forgetfulness of - strict&#xD;
decorum, which Mr. Barnard and Mr. Titan&#xD;
might manifest upon such an occasion.&#xD;
" Very right, very right.  I will," replied&#xD;
Moses.&#xD;

thought and feeling aroused by the numerous in-&#xD;

much increased by the division of labor and re-&#xD;
sponsibility, the sense of security, and the inter-&#xD;
change of philosophical criticisms therein. His&#xD;
repeated and prolonged absences from his friends&#xD;

caused Mr. Barnard to express some surprise at&#xD;

dudgeon to him, upon their resuming the subject.&#xD;
"It is all your fault-all your fault !"&#xD;

Mr. Wagbull.&#xD;
" Yes, What do you allow the young jacka-&#xD;

This was a clincher, and the son, in filial bene-&#xD;
volence, whatever his own feelings may have bccu,&#xD;
sympathetically expressed his deep horror at the&#xD;
backsliding of his daughter, and feigned such a&#xD;
contortion of features as he supposed would be&#xD;
most likely to convey to his aged parent his mel-&#xD;
ancholy and irritation at the unhappy state of&#xD;

after a pause, " I don't see, aner all, why it i3&#xD;

"Oh i no, no, mother," hastily interposed Mr.&#xD;
Wagbull, fearful of unneccessarily agitatiig the&#xD;

the old lady fiercely, "to uphold your daughter,&#xD;

"Wait a moment, mother," interjected the&#xD;
somewhat confused son, as the old lady was pro.&#xD;
ceeding fervently to bring her whole stock of&#xD;
wise saws to bear upon the important matter.&#xD;
"That's it I wait a moment l" proceeded the&#xD;
old lady at lightning speed. "In much merri-&#xD;
ment there is food for sorrow. Where ignorance&#xD;
is bliss, it's folly to be wise. Let one man know&#xD;

"0 pshaw ! I don't care what you do with&#xD;

tience. "I would like to have you listen to me a&#xD;
moment, just for one moment, and you will be&#xD;
satisfied, I hope, with what I have to say."&#xD;
"I shan't do it I" said the old. lady decidedly.&#xD;
"I know what you are going to say. You are&#xD;
going to connive at and defend that jackanapes,&#xD;
who has come here and-"&#xD;
"Fiddle! What have I to do with that jack.&#xD;
Ignapes? As for that matter, I wi.h he was in&#xD;

"I won't. Nothing can make me. But I&#xD;

And thereupon the distracted gentleman, deter-&#xD;
miniig to let things take their natural course, in-&#xD;
mediately took himself into the street, and to a&#xD;
neighboring pot-house, for all we know.&#xD;
CHAPTER LXI.&#xD;
MOSES JIAS A BRIEF nUT INTERESTING INTERVIEW&#xD;
WITH THE GREAT COLLECTOR OF THE PORT, AND&#xD;
-RECEIVEs AN APPOINTMENT FOR A FUTURE 0N5&#xD;
IT is not necessary for us to remind our intelli.-&#xD;
gen-t readers that Mir. Wagbuil was really very&#xD;
&#xD;
132&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
fond of our hero. There in fact appeared to him&#xD;
but one point in Moses's character, which he von-&#xD;
sidered a weakness. In the noble science of pol.&#xD;
itics, he was forced to set him down as an Utopi-&#xD;
an dreamer, an impracticable schemer. We are&#xD;
now happily called upon to chronicle a series of&#xD;
events, in which our hero became deeply involved,&#xD;
and during the progress of which, we shall notice&#xD;
an entire and radical change in this opinion,&#xD;
which the old gentleman had hitherto entertained&#xD;
of Moses's diplomatic abilities, and we shall show&#xD;
him compelled, by the ordinary testimony of his&#xD;
senses and reasoning powers, to acknowledge an&#xD;
extraordinary display of those very qualities of&#xD;
intellect, which he had hitherto denied to his&#xD;
young friend.- These will appear a complete and&#xD;
triumphant refutation of the sentiments which&#xD;
he had previously expressed thereon.&#xD;
To - be sure, the reader may observe in the&#xD;
course of these events, that our hero was, per&#xD;
haps, assisted in their happy development, by the&#xD;
natural working of external principles, but so it&#xD;
is in the progress of every human action. Man's&#xD;
efforts and chance are ever inexplicably inter-&#xD;
twined, and it is impossible for the most subtle&#xD;
dissecter of occurrences to separate the one from&#xD;
the other, even in the most ordinary instances.&#xD;
This gives an opportunity to cavilers to exer.&#xD;
cise their talents, and undoubtedly some such&#xD;
evilly-disposed persons may be inclined, after&#xD;
perusing the following events, to feel and say&#xD;
that they came to a happy denouement, rather&#xD;
from their own force than any thing Mr- Wink-&#xD;
field did, and that he was even wholly unac-&#xD;
qiainted with their true nature from beginning&#xD;
to end. But what of that? If the successes of&#xD;
some of the greatest statesmen or generals which&#xD;
the world has produced, be thus minutely exam-&#xD;
ined, some cynical critic may doubtless be found&#xD;
to attribute the crowning effect to hazard, or the&#xD;
natural flow of events, rather than to his fellow-&#xD;
beings' efforts. We do not say that a just scr-&#xD;
tiny should not be undertaken, and indeed we&#xD;
feel that as far as possible an arrival at a true&#xD;
discrimination of the various powers jointly pro-&#xD;
ducing a mundane result, should be ardently and&#xD;
persistently sought for by the philosophic mind;&#xD;
but it would be a happy rule, if this were usually&#xD;
attempted for a good purpose instead of an evil&#xD;
one. If mankind habitually used their judgments&#xD;
in such cases, to exonerate a fellow-being from&#xD;
blame for want of success, and to attribute fail-&#xD;
ure, where it generally belongs, to the force of&#xD;
extrinsic circumstances, we would have, refrained&#xD;
from making these remarks. We have spoken&#xD;
feelingly upon the subject, for we ourselves know&#xD;
whatit is to have suffered from the one-sided,&#xD;
but, alas! apparently natural working of this sin-&#xD;
gular principle. We have known instances, in&#xD;
our experience, where, from want of success, our&#xD;
effbrts have been considered even asinine in their&#xD;
nature; and the more deeply interested in us the&#xD;
judges thereof, the more explicit seems to have&#xD;
been the expression of some such hearty disap-&#xD;
proval thereof.&#xD;
But let us return from this honest digression&#xD;
of the moment, which ought to have the effect of&#xD;
Protecting our hero against any thoughtless con-&#xD;
clusions upon the part of the readers of this mar-&#xD;
rative, with regard to the part he may play herein,&#xD;
and perhaps be the means of securing to him, in&#xD;
the minds of many, an impartial award of that&#xD;
&#xD;
admiration which he generally deserves as the&#xD;
firm and intelligent upholder of some of the finest&#xD;
principles of our constitution. We sincerely hope&#xD;
it will at least thwart any attempts which vulgar&#xD;
minds may make to cast ridicule upon his adven-&#xD;
tures, and convert them into a source of ill-judged&#xD;
levity and merriment.&#xD;
It will be remembered, that, in the last interview&#xD;
which Moses had with his unfortunate acquaint-&#xD;
ance, Mr. Lampson, he had determined that a&#xD;
place in one of the public offices would be a&#xD;
pleasant situation for the latter, and also that it&#xD;
was agreed upon, the Custom House offered the&#xD;
best inducements to a person desirous of some&#xD;
leisure for literary pursuits. Moses resolved and&#xD;
promised that, he would immediately proceed in&#xD;
the business. The opportunity was offered to him&#xD;
at an evening party which he attended shortly&#xD;
afterward. The salons of the accomplished lady&#xD;
giving it were filled with the &amp;amp;ite and beauty of&#xD;
the city, but the person who became at once,&#xD;
on this interesting evening, the object of Moses's&#xD;
devotion, was not any one of the fair sex, but a&#xD;
gentleman of portly mien and heavy smile, a&#xD;
gentleman in fact with a Presence. This gentle-&#xD;
man was known to the world at large as the chief&#xD;
of the revenue department of the national govern-&#xD;
ment at New-York, though in political circles it&#xD;
was well known that the duties, which he was or&#xD;
ought to have been performing about this time,&#xD;
were those connected with the dispensation of the&#xD;
presidential patronage in furthering the interests&#xD;
of the illustrious chief of the nation, who was then&#xD;
very properly looking to a reflection. Upon learn-&#xD;
ing that this affable gentleman, then circulating in&#xD;
the drawing-room, was such-an important person-&#xD;
age as the Collector of the Port, Moses at once&#xD;
unsophisticatedly proposed to be introduced to&#xD;
him, to lay a short statement of facts before him,&#xD;
in reference to his application, and receive immedi-&#xD;
ately thereupon the desired appointment for Mr.&#xD;
Lampson in writing; thus avoiding the necessity&#xD;
of revealing the latter's unfortunate condition to&#xD;
intermediate parties.&#xD;
The persistence with which Moses followed the&#xD;
great politician from one room to another, and&#xD;
closely watched all of his motions, in endeavoring&#xD;
to seize the first courteous opportunity offered&#xD;
for the furtherance of his plans, became at last&#xD;
an object of attention on the part of the states.&#xD;
man himself. Besides possessing the usual sa-&#xD;
gacity of a person experienced in reading the&#xD;
motives of human nature, especially when dis-&#xD;
guised, the latter had at this moment particular&#xD;
reasons for believing he saw something else in&#xD;
Moses's close scrutiny than mere political solicita-&#xD;
tion or social admiration.&#xD;
It was an important week in politics. Upon&#xD;
the Tuesday following the annual nomination by&#xD;
the Republican party of its candidate for the may-&#xD;
oralty was to be made, atnd the heartburning, jeal-&#xD;
ousies and machinations which arose in the se-&#xD;
cret conclaves of the party itself were far ruore&#xD;
intense and exciting to the members than the&#xD;
open battle which was to take place subsequently&#xD;
with the foe. The party was violently divided&#xD;
upon the claims of two principal candidates for&#xD;
the nonmination. and -it vas well known that the&#xD;
only hope of either to obtain it depended upon&#xD;
the will of the collector, and the direction of his&#xD;
influence in-the convention. That officer, though&#xD;
appointed by the President, had pleasantly turned&#xD;
&#xD;
133&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7256-00000068"/>&#xD;
134                    MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD.                    135&#xD;
&#xD;
a traitor to him and secretly favored the presiden-&#xD;
tial aspirations of a distinguished member of his&#xD;
cabinet. It was the collector's object to use the&#xD;
influence of his position in the coming elections&#xD;
in favor of those aspirations without an overt act&#xD;
of treason to the President, that is, of securing&#xD;
for them the fealty of the candidate upon whom&#xD;
it should be bestowed, without being found out.&#xD;
The position, though amusing, was shaky, and&#xD;
required great ecrecy and caution in being sus-&#xD;
tained. His principal inthe Washington Cabinet&#xD;
had therefore informed him of what measures of&#xD;
espionage, treachery and intrigue he now wished&#xD;
to have performed for the furtherance of his in-&#xD;
terests, and had judiciously proposed to dispatch&#xD;
to him a proper person, one particularly faithful&#xD;
and capable, who might under his directions exe-&#xD;
cute the plans without danger \of compromising&#xD;
their relations with the administration.&#xD;
"If I can spare him from here he will arrive,"&#xD;
ran the letter, in a day or two and present hiu-&#xD;
self at once to you. He has been properly in-&#xD;
structed as to the caution to be used, and has&#xD;
been fully advised by me upon the measures to&#xD;
be executed. After consulting with him upon&#xD;
the main points you can safely leave him to faith.&#xD;
fully fill up the outlines. Be careful of your places&#xD;
of interview, by all means, as he is a stranger to&#xD;
localities."&#xD;
So when Moses, finally observing a propitious&#xD;
moment for an introduction, advanced with the&#xD;
host to the great collector, the latter reverting to-&#xD;
the letter he had received, was induced to bestow&#xD;
some attention upon the movements of our hero,&#xD;
but still cautiously, and awaiting further develop-&#xD;
ments upon his part. In consequence of the&#xD;
favorable aspect of the collector, Moses proceeded&#xD;
at once, after the salutatory remarks, on his bene-&#xD;
volent purpose.7&#xD;
"If you will allow me, sir, said he, as they&#xD;
.were left together, '1I will inform you at once,&#xD;
sir, that in thus trespassing upon your presence,&#xD;
I am animated by a desire to further the interests&#xD;
of another person-a gentleman whom I trust&#xD;
you-"&#xD;
Ah ! you are a stranger here," said-the states-&#xD;
man, looking at him with increased significance.&#xD;
"You come from a friend, ahem !"&#xD;
"Yes, sir," replied Moses modestly.  "Yes,&#xD;
sir, I am a comparative stranger, but-"&#xD;
"Hush ! 'sh !" said the other suddenly.&#xD;
Eh ?" ejaculated Moses, as he observed the&#xD;
collector looking around him in apparent alarm.&#xD;
"'Sh! Some one comes," whispered the lat-&#xD;
ter, in sudden confidence.&#xD;
"Yes. Yes, sir, but-"&#xD;
" A very chaste bought! a very chaste&#xD;
thought, indeed !" exc aimed the collector aloud.,&#xD;
"I think he s one of our finest poets, sir ",'&#xD;
"I beg your pardon, but from some stupid&#xD;
inadvertence I did not-"&#xD;
"Oh ! frequently, frequently P" continue the&#xD;
collector loudly. "He often dines with me to&#xD;
chat upon the fine arts."&#xD;
1I hope you will pardon me," cried Moses, who&#xD;
imagined that the collector had fallen into a kind&#xD;
of soliloquizing state; "but I thought Imight-"&#xD;
.  'Sh  I can see Badger coming, and there is&#xD;
Wagbull looking this way ! Present yourself to-&#xD;
morrow, at eleven, at .the basement-door of my&#xD;
house, disguised as a milkmna, Be cautious !&#xD;
Continue to mingle in the festivities, and don't&#xD;
&#xD;
come within ten feet of me during the evening,"&#xD;
said the politician in a low voice, but with great&#xD;
rapidity, and he immediately continued as Mr.&#xD;
Badger approached them: "Ah ! yes, ahem! A&#xD;
very noble sentiment,,very indeed! (Remember,&#xD;
keep quiet and keep in another room! I leave&#xD;
you now!) Ah Badger! how are you to-night ?"&#xD;
And off he went, leaving Moses to philosophize&#xD;
as best he could upon the abrupt termination of&#xD;
his application.&#xD;
Mr. Wagbull, as our readers may have already&#xD;
seen, was one of the many respectable citizens,&#xD;
who so assiduously attend to the wants of needy&#xD;
and worthy office-seekers, under the hallucination&#xD;
that they are performing one of the first duties&#xD;
which the citizen owes to his country, and in&#xD;
fact, exercising an immense influence upon the&#xD;
progress of civilization in general; which is prob-&#xD;
ably quite true, though in a way little suspected&#xD;
by them. The social influence of there wretched&#xD;
dupes was impressed upon them as of particular&#xD;
importance, and Mr. Wagbull, in great political&#xD;
ardor, had intended to make this social gather-&#xD;
ing an occasion for homage to the collector, in&#xD;
behalf of one of the candidates whose cause&#xD;
he had warmly espoused; having, furthermore,&#xD;
Itme indefinite hopes of inducing the unsuspect-&#xD;
ing collector, in a weakened moment, to commit&#xD;
himself. From the natural circumspection of the&#xD;
latter against such wiles, or what was more&#xD;
likely, from  Mr. Waghull's own confused no-&#xD;
tions as to how he should proceed, he had not&#xD;
been able to say a word to the great man, even&#xD;
upon such an allowable subject as the weather.&#xD;
When he observed Mr. Winkfield, therefore, in&#xD;
apparently familiar conversation with the cyno-&#xD;
sure, he disengaged himself as soon as possible&#xD;
from an old lady who had attached him to her ear-&#xD;
trumpet, and with a mingled feeling of envy and&#xD;
curiosity, sought the presence of Moses, just as the&#xD;
latter was recovering from his astonishment, and&#xD;
was soliloquizing upon the adroitness with which&#xD;
public men are accustomed to guard themselves&#xD;
against the approach of solicitors, it having struck&#xD;
him that this example of it wa about the most&#xD;
rapid and efficacious one that could be insti-&#xD;
tuted.&#xD;
" Eh i?" said Mr. Wagbull, in great curiosity,&#xD;
a I see you have had a conversation with the&#xD;
collector"..&#xD;
"Yes," replied Moses, continuing his solilo-&#xD;
quy. (" Feigning literary abstraction, he pre-&#xD;
vents my broaching the subject at once, and&#xD;
only grants me an interview by coupling it with&#xD;
commands which are extremely disagreeable-&#xD;
very !")&#xD;
" What-what were you talking about," asked&#xD;
Mr. Wagbull softly, still a prey to his curiosity,&#xD;
and envying the late opportunity of Moses.&#xD;
" Oh ! nothing! nothing!- Merely respects,"&#xD;
replied Moses. "I had scarcely time to address&#xD;
him before we were interrupted. (But I must be&#xD;
firm and waive all foolish self-respect in this&#xD;
matter," continued lie in heroic meditation. "I&#xD;
will obey his commands, for I must have the in-&#xD;
terview, milkman or not.")-      .&#xD;
The thought of the fine opportunity, which&#xD;
Moses had possessed and which might have been&#xD;
used in favor of Mr. Wagbull's candidate for the&#xD;
mayoralty, caused an irritation in the old gentle-&#xD;
man's bosom. lie regretted again and audibly&#xD;
Moses's want of that peculiar gemus'which dis-&#xD;
&#xD;
poses men to interest themselves in such matters,&#xD;
and inwardly characterized the latter's hasty pro-&#xD;
-posal to adjourn to the card-room, as an evidence&#xD;
of his flippant indifference to such momentous con-&#xD;
cerns.&#xD;
CHAPTER     LXIL&#xD;
THE ADVENTURES OF SHORTE.&#xD;
Ma.BoBBY was not perhaps an iniiately bad&#xD;
person, but was still of that class of young gen-&#xD;
tlemen quite common in civilized communities&#xD;
who grow up with the idea that to spend money&#xD;
on one's self is the chief aim of existence. His&#xD;
method of doing so was not peculiar to himself&#xD;
either, nor was the fact of having already dissi-&#xD;
pated his own inheritance in such foolish excite-&#xD;
ment as the society of firemen and other rough&#xD;
characters. furnished him. Young men may be&#xD;
found at all times and in every place who go&#xD;
through precisely such a course before they are&#xD;
hanged, or marry. It is quite natural for such&#xD;
characters also to covet time possessions of their&#xD;
relatives when they have no longer any of their&#xD;
own, and have also exhausted the little supplement&#xD;
of spendthrift bankruptcy, which consists in&#xD;
borrowing of their tailors and boot-makers. Mr.&#xD;
Bobby was therefore quite in earnest when he&#xD;
threatened to visit the intervention of a third par-&#xD;
ty against. his fraternal privilege of spending&#xD;
his sister's money for her with such severe meas-&#xD;
ures as cutting said party's throat, or removing&#xD;
his cuticle. It was not from moral derangement&#xD;
that he proposed such things, but it was only un-&#xD;
der the painful aspect of the necessity of such&#xD;
measures to protect his own rights. In fact, it&#xD;
may be doubted whether after all he possessed&#xD;
sufficient contempt for the laws to essay the first&#xD;
pleasant process, or sufficient' scientific know-&#xD;
ledge to accomplish the second. 1&#xD;
Now among those who frequently enjoyed the&#xD;
society of this young gentleman, at the carriage-&#xD;
house of Hose Company No. 20, chiefly before&#xD;
and after conflagrations, was an individual who&#xD;
belonged to the class well known to every fire&#xD;
company as "runners," young ragamuffins who&#xD;
regard fires as special dispensations sent to pro-&#xD;
vide them with clothing and other articles of&#xD;
personal necessity, who worship "the machine"&#xD;
as an idol, and look upon the- officers and mem-&#xD;
bers of the company as priests of the temple, to&#xD;
be numbered among whom is one of the princi-&#xD;
pal aims of their ambition. This lively young&#xD;
outcast, called Shortey, from his vain attempts&#xD;
to ateal any coats that did not reach to his heels&#xD;
or pantaloons which he was not compelled to roll&#xD;
up in two or three folds at the bottom, had a&#xD;
nimble perception of situations and a brilliantI&#xD;
way of putting them to his own behoof. So&#xD;
when he heard the afflicted Bobby's distressed&#xD;
remarks in convivial moments respecting his sis-&#xD;
ter's superfluous jewelry and money, and the be-&#xD;
neficent purposes to which such valuable stuff&#xD;
might be put were it in proper hands, he pro-&#xD;
posed to take the first step toward such a benev-&#xD;
olent consummation by causing it to come into&#xD;
his own hands through the gentle process of&#xD;
stealing. After a short and easy meditation upon&#xD;
the plan of action he proceeded to insert it as a&#xD;
&#xD;
fixed fact in the general scheme of mundane&#xD;
events by inserting himself at a proper moment&#xD;
in the Bobby apartments, to the doors of which&#xD;
he had been accustomed to familiar access as&#xD;
casual errand-boy for Mr. Bobby. How intense&#xD;
is the intoxication of feeling which is experi-&#xD;
enced in the fascinating pastime of robbery I We&#xD;
do not, of course, speak from experience, but&#xD;
merely reason that it must be so from general&#xD;
principles and from the examples which are pre-&#xD;
sented on the historic page in the achievements&#xD;
of the illustrious thieves who constitute nine&#xD;
tefiths of its heroes. The pleasures of hope, of&#xD;
the execution of a purpose, of a proud conscious-&#xD;
ness of abilities, of the chivalrous virtues of cour-&#xD;
age, self-reliance, and daring are all harmoniously&#xD;
mingled in one grand thrill of spiritual e6xalta-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
Such the gallant Shortey experienced as he&#xD;
paused for a moment in his successful rummage&#xD;
of Miss Bobby's drawei-s. Every thing had been&#xD;
propitious. It was the evening hour of nine.&#xD;
Mr. Bobby as usual was paying his evening visit&#xD;
to the hose-house, and Miss Bobby was upon one&#xD;
to a place of entertainment. Should either re-&#xD;
turn, he could slip into the parlor of the suite,&#xD;
or one of the two adjoining bed-rooms and qui.&#xD;
etly gain the hall by its door; for according to&#xD;
the excellent arrangements of this hotel its suites&#xD;
were especially adapted to facilitate operations&#xD;
of this nature. In his coqtempt for danger he&#xD;
gave utterance to his enravished feelings in an&#xD;
audible snicker. He was contemplating reclin-&#xD;
ing in an easy-chair of the parlor for the pur-&#xD;
pose of indulging in an open haw-haw as the&#xD;
comical brilliancy of the whole affair struck him,&#xD;
when he heard footsteps in the hall apparently&#xD;
approaching the apartments.&#xD;
Shortey was fallible. There were too many&#xD;
doors ready for him to escape through. le hes-&#xD;
itated. The hand of some one was upon the&#xD;
parlor door-knob and a key was being inserted&#xD;
in the lock, when he threw himself into neither&#xD;
of the chambers, but into a convenient closet,&#xD;
which stood directly at his side.  The comers&#xD;
were evidently a lady and gentleman, the former&#xD;
without doubt Miss Bobby, though the latter,&#xD;
Shortey knew from the foreign accents of the&#xD;
voice which he heard, was not her brother.&#xD;
" It is quite close in here," said Miss Bobby to&#xD;
her companion as she turned on the gas. "And&#xD;
-dear me, I positively thought I detected the&#xD;
odor of-of-really, of onions, as I came in. Did&#xD;
not you?"&#xD;
" Why, no. But now I come to think of it,&#xD;
perhaps I do smell a slight odor of that kind. It&#xD;
bas escaped without doubt from the kitchens be-&#xD;
low," replied her companion delicately.&#xD;
"It will disappear presently, no doubt," con-&#xD;
tinued the lady, opening the window. "I am&#xD;
glad we did iot attend the entertainment, after&#xD;
all. What a charming walk we have had, and,&#xD;
dear friend, I feel so grateful to you for it I"&#xD;
"Oh !" said the friend, evidently much affect-&#xD;
ed by this, "don't mention it, I beg. It is I&#xD;
who should be grateful for the exquisite happi-&#xD;
ness I experience in your society.  0 Moffa-&#xD;
tina !"&#xD;
" Ah ! how delightful it is to experience sweet&#xD;
friendship ~n one's home !" murmured the lady&#xD;
ina suffused tone.&#xD;
" And in that sacred precinct may I not ever&#xD;

136                       MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
call you Moffatina, dear Moffatina ?" said the gen-&#xD;
tleman in reply.&#xD;
There was a slight noise as of the moving of&#xD;
chairs, followed by a pleasant sound. The gen-&#xD;
tleman was evidently very properly kissing the&#xD;
lady.&#xD;
"Yes, and the time will come when I will&#xD;
shout that sweet name in defiance from the house-&#xD;
tops I" continued lie vehemently, "at the-the&#xD;
unworthy being who has the endearing privilege&#xD;
of calling you sister, and peremptorily ask *him&#xD;
what-what he means ?"&#xD;
"HushI hush ! I pray you. Ie is not here,&#xD;
but 'tis best to be ever cautious. His cars may&#xD;
reach from the engine-house even here l" inter-&#xD;
rupted the lady.&#xD;
"True!" replied the gentleman in undisguised&#xD;
irritation.&#xD;
"See! he has taken7Pet with him again, to&#xD;
amuse his companions with her tricks. He will&#xD;
not be back till a late hour."&#xD;
"There is one benefit in his low attachment&#xD;
for these engino-men," continued the gentleman&#xD;
as his irritation faded away. "It enables me,&#xD;
dear Moffatina, to enjoy undisturbedly the pleas-&#xD;
ure which I deem the greatest I could be blessed&#xD;
with!"&#xD;
"Dear Mr. Titman I I am so happy, and yet&#xD;
so unhappy !" proceeded the young lady. "He&#xD;
makes me so unhappy, Cruel Dalkewell "&#xD;
"But, by heaven! for your sake alone this&#xD;
state of things shall not exist. No, I will meet&#xD;
him face to ftce," continued Mr. Titan chival-&#xD;
rously, aroused again by the young lady's decla-&#xD;
ration of trouble. "I will defy his threats, and&#xD;
sternly, savagely demand from him-"&#xD;
"Gracious! Hark " interrupted the young&#xD;
lady. -0&#xD;
"What is it ?" asked Mr. Titman, pausing.&#xD;
"It is he I His footsteps !" exclaimed  the&#xD;
young lady, rising agitatedly from her seat and&#xD;
hastening toward the parlor-door. "I hear them&#xD;
in the hall. He is returning already !"&#xD;
"Good God! where shall I go?" aked Mr.&#xD;
Titman, rising from his seat with equal alacrity.&#xD;
"Where? Into his bed-room ?"         .&#xD;
"No, noI He may come in that way. But&#xD;
do please avoid him!"          ,t&#xD;
"Yes!1 But where? Into-to yours ?" said Mr.&#xD;
Titman, with some appearance of panic. "Where&#xD;
-where shall I go?"&#xD;
" Heavens ! I am so distracted! IHere, here,&#xD;
into this closet I" said the lady, and at these&#xD;
words Mr. Titman at once seized his hat and&#xD;
cloak, and leaped toward and into that place of&#xD;
concealment. Miss Bobby had scarcely closed&#xD;
the door upon him when her brother and dog&#xD;
entered.&#xD;
Shortey had heard every word of the above&#xD;
interesting conversation. His genius rose at its&#xD;
denouement. Though the society of the lover in&#xD;
the closet was unexpected to him, and that of&#xD;
any one an impediment to freedom of action in&#xD;
such a confined space, he instantly seized the sit-&#xD;
uation and seized Mr. Titman by the hair, placed&#xD;
a hand over his mouth and threatened to choke&#xD;
him to death if he uttered a word. The bewil-&#xD;
dered refugee gasped in overwhelmed terror at&#xD;
this unexpected rising of the closet against his&#xD;
security. Were demoniac spirits ordinarily kept&#xD;
in the jars and glass bottles upon its shelves, and&#xD;
had one of these come forth to attack him? His&#xD;
&#xD;
legs gave out beneath him, and he would have&#xD;
sunk violently upon the floor if the supernatural&#xD;
agency had not- mitigated  his subsidence by&#xD;
means of its grasp in his hair.&#xD;
" Guy me yer hat and yer wropper," whis.&#xD;
pered the apparition, fragrantly'&#xD;
The lover was unable to do so from the paraly-&#xD;
sis of his terror,.but he was equally unable to&#xD;
take any opposition to surrendering the articles&#xD;
mentioned.&#xD;
" Take off yer coat and guy it to me! Leave&#xD;
the change in it."&#xD;
The appalled victim made a semi-unconscious&#xD;
effort, and succeeded iu obeying this second re-&#xD;
quest.&#xD;
"Now say any think and I'll saw yer juggler,&#xD;
or expose yer to him as yer imposing' onto, yer&#xD;
villink 1" whispered the mysterious power, eon-&#xD;
cluding its conversational effort.&#xD;
Had the terrified lover possessed the compre-&#xD;
hension of affairs to have known that the last&#xD;
alternative of this dreadful threat could not have&#xD;
been other than a piece of audacious satire, it&#xD;
still would have apprised him that he was in a&#xD;
situation wherein he was debarred from making&#xD;
4 resistance of any kind against this unexpected&#xD;
antagonist. As it was, he occupied his time in&#xD;
simply breathing, being temporarily content with&#xD;
that simple way of continuing his existence.&#xD;
Shortly continued ready for' the emergenuie&#xD;
which might arise without the closet, and as it is&#xD;
our object in this chapter to follow the adventure&#xD;
of this ingenious and daring spirit to its issue, we&#xD;
will briefly recount what took place on the&#xD;
exterior.&#xD;
, " Alit is that you, Bakewell ?" said Miss Bob-&#xD;
by4astily placing herself in a chair and assum-&#xD;
in  a srene attitude, as her brother entered.&#xD;
"Yu are home soon ' "&#xD;
" i'm. I thought I'd get a goodpiglit's sleep&#xD;
of it," replied the pleasant youth,' condescending&#xD;
to explain. "Igot devilish tired last night at the&#xD;
carriage-house, helping to elect, the officers and&#xD;
drinking the punch. What is this smell ofgonions&#xD;
here?"&#xD;
-1 1 eally don't know. I thought I detected it&#xD;
too. It must come through the register from be-&#xD;
low," replied the young lady.&#xD;
" Well, I will turn it off."&#xD;
"And Pet is glad to get back too!" continued&#xD;
Miss Bobby, attempting to conceal her agitation&#xD;
by complaisance. "Come here, Petty, come here,&#xD;
little dog."&#xD;
The animal was about obeying his mistress's&#xD;
command, when he paused, snuffed uneasily about&#xD;
the carpet and whined.&#xD;
' "What is the matter with the little devil ?"&#xD;
asked the brother, yawning, and throwing his legs&#xD;
upon a chair.&#xD;
" I don't know. He must be affected by the&#xD;
odor also. Go lie down, Pet.  Be quiet, sir,"&#xD;
said the young lady authoritatively, to the un-&#xD;
dasy dog.&#xD;
The unsatisfied animal obeyed.&#xD;
"I think I'll step down to the reading-room to&#xD;
see if the papers say any thing about our elec-&#xD;
tion, before I go to bed," continued Mr. Bobby,&#xD;
rising from his chair, after a moment or two. "I&#xD;
shan't be gone but a short time, but leave the gas&#xD;
burning hn here if you go to bed before I get&#xD;
back, sis."&#xD;
" Oh ! yes, I will!1" said the trembling young&#xD;
&#xD;
lady, with ill-concealed satisfaction at this unex&#xD;
pected favor of chance.&#xD;
And receiving her promise, the young man be&#xD;
took himself from the room and went below. As&#xD;
soon as the sound of his footsteps died away on&#xD;
the staircase, Miss Bobby rushed in excited agi&#xD;
station to the gas-jet, diminished the light, and&#xD;
then turning to the closet, hastily opened its&#xD;
door. As she was about invoking her lover, in&#xD;
a frantic whisper, to come forth, there rather&#xD;
abruptly e nerged a form, wrapped in his well-&#xD;
known Raglan, with his hat already placed upon&#xD;
his head, and his face prudently muffled from&#xD;
view. No words emanated from his lips, but in&#xD;
sweet token of adieu he hurriedly waved his dis-&#xD;
engaged hand, rapidly gained the door, and sped&#xD;
toward one of the staircases,.&#xD;
Whether he met his friend Bobby in his egress,&#xD;
and accounted to him for his presence, or evaded&#xD;
him entirely, we can not say ; but Shortey had&#xD;
been absent scarely a moment when Mr. Bobby&#xD;
returned with the newspapers in his hand which&#xD;
he had secured for the purpose of reading in bed.&#xD;
The dog, who had been aroused from his uneasy&#xD;
position by the recent unusual events in the&#xD;
apartment, darted in trembling joy at his master,&#xD;
looked up, whined again, and then with renewed&#xD;
courage was about directing his course to the&#xD;
closet, when his mistress forcibly took him in her&#xD;
arms, and, irritated by the fear that some suspi-&#xD;
cions might be aroused in her brother's mind by&#xD;
the animal's disquiet, vehemently tapped him&#xD;
upon the head and placed him in his basket in&#xD;
the corner. A sufficient time had elapsed, be-&#xD;
tween the departure of the successful Shortey and&#xD;
the advent of Mr- Bobby, for- the extraction of&#xD;
Mr. Titman also from the diffi-ulty. But that&#xD;
unhappy gentleman was in a state of stupor, im-&#xD;
minently bordering upon that of insensibility.&#xD;
He began to revive from this situationjust as&#xD;
the conversation, which Mr. Bobby renewed with&#xD;
his sister turned once more upon the vexed sub-&#xD;
lject of lovers, and just as the gentleman, no&#xD;
doubt, especially alluded to him therein.&#xD;
"1Who's that little tailor I saw you with on the&#xD;
Avenue, yesterday ?" asked the young man.&#xD;
"Confound him! if he comes around here, hum-&#xD;
bugging you, I'll blow his head off; or any of&#xD;
'em."                                -&#xD;
"He's not a tailor! How dare you continue&#xD;
to talk to me in this way, Bakewell?" replied the&#xD;
young lady in indignant irritation. "Am  I not&#xD;
older than you ? I shall manage my own affairs,&#xD;
I assure you, and what is more, gratify my own&#xD;
wishes and not yours in selecting my society !"&#xD;
"1You're a fool, Moff, and devil take me if I&#xD;
don't show these -sneaks there's some sense left&#xD;
in the family any bow, if they-there's that dog&#xD;
whining again!  What is the matter with him ?&#xD;
Here, Pet, come here. What is the matter with&#xD;
ypu ?"&#xD;
The restless dog, assured by.the command of&#xD;
his master, jumped up vigorously, rushed toward&#xD;
the closet, and commenced to bark loudly.&#xD;
" He is not hungry. By heaven ! he smells a&#xD;
rat !" said the brother, rising in excitement and&#xD;
walking toward the closet. "By Flanagan, there&#xD;
is a rat in here !" continued he, laying down his&#xD;
papers on a chair. " Wait a moment ! Now you'll&#xD;
see somne fun, Mofrey, Keep quiet and you'll see&#xD;
some fun !''&#xD;
Miss Bobby entered fully into the spirit of the&#xD;
&#xD;
- suggestion. She was only too thankful that thero&#xD;
was now only a rat in the closet. "Open the&#xD;
.door slowly," commanded she vivaciously.&#xD;
'Mr. Bobby obeyed her, and immediately the&#xD;
grand spectacle of "the futi" was inaugurated.&#xD;
- The disordered Titman broke from his place of&#xD;
imprisonment with such rude, panic-stricken ve-&#xD;
locity, that lie overthrew the astounded Mr. Bob-&#xD;
by, crushed the howling dog into the carpet, and&#xD;
by these events secured at least a half minute's&#xD;
start in the race which was subsequently to ensue.&#xD;
The yaung lady, overcome with surprise and&#xD;
terror at the unexlainable mystery, uttered a&#xD;
shriek and fainted upon the floor, as the spirit of&#xD;
her lover or whatever the apparition was, bolted&#xD;
past her with pallid features for t!e door. With&#xD;
Shortey's coat flying in the wind behind him, Mr.&#xD;
Titman was already tearing down the street ere&#xD;
Mr. Bobby recovered from the shock of his pros-&#xD;
tration. The latter rushed frantically in pursuit,&#xD;
but Mr. Titman had escaped. Closely imitating&#xD;
the-ingenious method of the hunted bare, the fly-&#xD;
ing refugee ran down one street, up another, and&#xD;
through lanes, parallel and crosswise.  He rode&#xD;
in omnibuses and cars, darted into grocery stores&#xD;
and apothecary shops, and finally, having expend-&#xD;
ed the little cash which Shortey had left on his&#xD;
person in small purchases in various parts of the&#xD;
city, and exhausted his physical forces in his con-&#xD;
tinued excitement, reached his home somewhere&#xD;
toward midnight.   There, securely locked in&#xD;
his chamber, he congratulated himself on his es-&#xD;
cape, though the events seemed sternly to signify&#xD;
that the time had now come for him to meet the&#xD;
brother, boldly explain his position, and resolute-&#xD;
ly demand fair proceedings upon the latter's part.&#xD;
CHAPTER LXIII.&#xD;
MOSES .coMFIDES ma DENEVOLENT  RoJECT TO MR.&#xD;
WAOnULL, AND PROCEEDS TO FURTHER IT IN A&#xD;
SECOND INTERVIEW WITH THE GREAT COLLECTOR.&#xD;
TiE envy of Moses's late opportunity with the&#xD;
collector and the regret at his iidifference to po-&#xD;
litical matters still rankled in Mr. Vagbull's&#xD;
bosom.&#xD;
"I grant you, my daughter," said he, with an&#xD;
air of great acuteness, in a conversation with his&#xD;
daughter at breakfast, the next day after the par-&#xD;
ty, "nb fault can be found by any one with the&#xD;
excellence and vigor of Mr. Winkfield's intellec-&#xD;
lectual faculties, as faculties. No, on the con-&#xD;
trary, I must warmly defend them!"&#xD;
" Well, then, what do you mean, papa, by say-&#xD;
ing you had concluded he dil not know any&#xD;
thing ?  Such a horrid remark I I am sure you&#xD;
did not know what you said !" said his daughter&#xD;
pettishly.&#xD;
" Ahi! there it is; I frankly admit he is pos.&#xD;
sessed of a brilliant intellect, truly brilliant, but&#xD;
my opinion is that in point of fact lie does not&#xD;
know how to use it!"&#xD;
"0 pshaw ; what does his brilliant intellect&#xD;
avail if he knows not how to use it ?"&#xD;
"The very point-the very point ! We are&#xD;
coming at it now. Yes, there is a certain want&#xD;
of' tact, of' politic management and diplomatic&#xD;
acuteness, which all such romantic anmd utopian&#xD;
people appear even delighted to evince."~&#xD;

though relying wholly upon your kindness."&#xD;
Ah ! yes," interrupted the collector, " a fin&#xD;

"Yes," continued Moses, "and one, sir, which&#xD;
I think ought not to be subjected to the nuimer&#xD;
ous cares which weigh so heavily upon it."&#xD;
1 Ah! indeed. Is he mudh embarrassed&#xD;

" He does. But still, in spite of them, I think&#xD;
he is really happy. He has a continual solace in&#xD;
the love and society of a lady who appears just&#xD;
fitted, sir, to warn, comfort, and conunand him,&#xD;
and, indeed, one whom almost any one might&#xD;
adore."&#xD;
" God bless me ! You don't say so ?  Deuce,&#xD;
I never knew that. He never let it out here.&#xD;
Ha, ha! Oh !"&#xD;
Ah ! have you known him long, sir?"&#xD;
"Long?   For over ten years. Ha, ha! It is&#xD;
the way with these strong intellects-they are&#xD;
always balanced with a strong emotional organ-&#xD;
ization.r-"&#xD;
"Hardly any one would ever know it," said&#xD;
Moses, they live so retired with their little&#xD;
family of two children."&#xD;
"Good God! But I see you possess his entire&#xD;
confidence-his entire confidence. You don't-&#xD;

ment.&#xD;
"MarriedI Why, of course."&#xD;
" He whom we have always bantered with re-&#xD;

This is the result of the scholar's endeavor-&#xD;
ing to conceal his poverty and social relations,"&#xD;
thought Moses; "yet it was for an honest pur-&#xD;
pose,,and I am really sorry I have alluded to it&#xD;
now.".&#xD;
"But to business," continued the collector.&#xD;
You have nothing further in the way of his&#xD;
written desires or propositions, have you?"&#xD;
soNo, sir. He merely thought that, by my per-&#xD;
sonal interviews With you, I could better explain&#xD;
matters to you."&#xD;
"The best way; and you have my entire con-&#xD;
fidence as well as his. 'Te charged you with se-&#xD;
crecy, of course, and it is between us three sole-&#xD;
ly, and in accordance with all our wishes, to&#xD;
strictly maintain it, eh? I see, like him, you are&#xD;
cautious in mentioning names. A very good&#xD;
practice, Mr. Winkfield. I take the liberty of&#xD;
Mentioning yours, as it is assumed, I suppose?&#xD;
Ha, ha!I&#xD;
No, sir; my own name, sir. I never do such&#xD;
things," said Moses, in suppressed indignation;&#xD;
,I never do such things. (Such is the love of&#xD;
intrigue among these public men ! Even in such&#xD;
small matters as granting an application for office,&#xD;
they insist upon the low machinery of milk-cans&#xD;
and aliases! I'll mention Mr. Wagbull to him.&#xD;
It ought to restore him to decency-to a sense&#xD;
of proper confidence-in the matter.) There is a&#xD;
gentleman in the city, Mr. Collector, by the name&#xD;
of Wagbull, who-"&#xD;
k  Good God! At the party last night?  You&#xD;
know him.?"&#xD;
.".Yes, sir," replied the surprised Moses, no-&#xD;
ticing the apparently intense feeling of the other&#xD;
party-.&#xD;
&#xD;
Y    "I simply warn you against him. Have no.&#xD;
thing to say to him. By mere blundering upon&#xD;
your plans and talking about them, he may do&#xD;
more damage to me in one moment than can be&#xD;
repaired ii a year, He is a perfect nuisance and&#xD;
dreadful button-holder; but look out for him; I&#xD;
insist upon it. I wisely keep vlear of him at all&#xD;
times, and you must."&#xD;
"-Ah! I didn't know," continued Moses, slowly&#xD;
recovering from his disagreeable astonishment at&#xD;
- the feeling betrayed by the collector toward his&#xD;
worthy friend and proposed parent.&#xD;
t   "I will not do any thing to-day," continued&#xD;
the collector; " but you can proceed in making&#xD;
your arrangements."&#xD;
"Aht! then, I suppose," said Moses, aroused at&#xD;
these words, "I may really regard my endeavors&#xD;
already successful, sir ? Can I feel now that a&#xD;
situation is promised ?"&#xD;
"Ha, ha! You are like the rest of them,&#xD;
young man. You must have your demands set-&#xD;
tled at once. Yes, a pace will be at your dis-&#xD;
posal after the elections. I must go to my&#xD;
office now. You will circulate, of course."&#xD;
"Circulate? Oh ! yes," replied Moses.&#xD;
" Well, be easy in your behavior with those&#xD;
you fall in with, and don't undertake to be too&#xD;
tight with them."&#xD;
" You may rest assured of that. It is not my&#xD;
habit, sir," replied Moses, somewhat confused&#xD;
and a little indignant at this ethical injunction&#xD;
of the collector.&#xD;
" I see, you kindly came withthe can. You&#xD;
had better leave in the same way," continued the&#xD;
collector; "be extremely cautious. By the way,&#xD;
leave me your address, and I will inform you&#xD;
when and where it is best for me to see you."&#xD;
Moses was somewhat surprised at this continu-&#xD;
ed manifestation of the desire for secrecy, but,&#xD;
with a feeling of gratitude, inexpressible in&#xD;
words, beaming from his countenance, he com-&#xD;
plied with the request of the warm-hearted but&#xD;
eccentric collector, and, gladly resuming the&#xD;
milk-can, rushed from the basement-door into&#xD;
the street with such a flourishing, abandon air as&#xD;
to lead many of the passers-by to conclude that&#xD;
this was only another one of the common in-&#xD;
stances of a near-sighted Dutch grocer's clerk&#xD;
kissing the chambermaid at the basement-door.&#xD;
CHAPTER LXIV.&#xD;
THE coNvERsION OF THE HEATHEN-THE nETROTH,&#xD;
MENT OF MR. JINKS LOMMEYDEw AND MRS. DIF-&#xD;
FICULTS BECOMES A FIXED FAcT.&#xD;
THE evening having arrived for the proposed&#xD;
meeting of colored Christians, with the worthy&#xD;
view of rescuing their benighted brother, the&#xD;
aged relative of one of their most respected&#xD;
members, Mr. Lommeydew, from his terrible er-&#xD;
ror, Brunswick apprised his master of the hour;&#xD;
and as it approached, the two wended their way&#xD;
to the colored chapel. The domestic had- been&#xD;
highly satisfied with the sudden shock which had&#xD;
been given to the easy flow of amorous inter-&#xD;
course between his step-mother and the divinity-&#xD;
student, and on the way informed his master&#xD;
that since her discovery of the diabolical proceed-&#xD;
&#xD;

140                              MR. WIUNh&#xD;
ings of the ancient grandsire, her air toward&#xD;
Mr. Lommeydew had apparently become quite a&#xD;
stern. She issued commands to him with great it&#xD;
freedom, and the appearance of an unusual anx- h&#xD;
iety upon the part of the lover plainly signified ti&#xD;
that a rupture might be possible.         -b&#xD;
They soon arrived at the church, which was a&#xD;
already crowded with excited members of both a&#xD;
sexes. Moses, extremely cautious that his pres- N&#xD;
ence should not be offensive, quietly gained a c&#xD;
seat in the obscurity of an unlighted gallery over. s&#xD;
the entrance, and awaited, with due respect for a&#xD;
the consecrated house and the humble sincerity n&#xD;
of its occupants, the opening of the proceedings. s&#xD;
The old colored gentleman who usually-presided I&#xD;
in the pulpit was a person who, although ex- t&#xD;
tremely illiterate, had, by sheer force of charac- t&#xD;
ter, sincere piety, and unflagging'zeal for the o&#xD;
secular as well as the religious interests ofV&#xD;
his flock, retained his position as pastor for a&#xD;
more than a dozen years, really beloved by'allo&#xD;
the ardent members, and both beloved and feared&#xD;
by the lukewarm. The recusant member, in&#xD;
company with two deacons of the church and his%&#xD;
grandson, occupied a front seat, and, after much r&#xD;
free conversation and stir in the assemblage, the I&#xD;
meeting was called to order by the' entrance ofr&#xD;
-the pastor. He mounted the desk, and, afterC&#xD;
arranging the sacred books thereon and hastily&#xD;
rubbing the dust therefrom with his sleeve, pro-&#xD;
ceeded, with some excitement, to make to theta&#xD;
congregation, ere he opened the exercises, aI&#xD;
statement upon an unexpected subject, which for 1&#xD;
the Inqment created a profound sensation and&#xD;
caused internal comparisons to be made by someI&#xD;
of the more learned in church history between&#xD;
the reverend pastor and some of the early mar-(&#xD;
tyrs.I&#xD;
" My bredren, you all knows Bedford, de uful-I&#xD;

I said, kinder actin', so I might kinder sorter&#xD;
dart into de grocery, said I, 'Ah! yes, de sum&#xD;

' Look yere, I have waited long 'nuff for dat, and&#xD;
I's asked you too many times. Now, ef yoti&#xD;
don't raise'dat air in free days, I'm jest gwine to&#xD;

My bredren, dis is a good ole church, I was&#xD;
sextarit of her, after I left de Newton, for over&#xD;
four years, while I was studyin' for de ministry,&#xD;
and I have since run her, off and on, as elder and&#xD;
preacher, for twelve year'n more. But',do you&#xD;
tink I's gwine to get tanned on account of yous&#xD;

will be anoder collection at do close of do ser-&#xD;
vices, but dat's for anoder ting. Jest you go to&#xD;
work and raise de seventeen dollars and sixty-&#xD;

dere hands in'do pockets of de males, and cause&#xD;
'em to exerumiate dere goods libully,"&#xD;
&#xD;
'1&#xD;
&#xD;
- I hope our reverend clergyman, Mr. Stokes,&#xD;
nd the brethren present will pardon the slight&#xD;
regularity of proceedings on the part of myself,"&#xD;
ere said a mulatto gentleman who had heard&#xD;
he appeal of the pastor with deep interest,,"but&#xD;
before the proceedings proceed I would wish to&#xD;
make a few remarks upon the party in question,&#xD;
s has made this abrupt demand on the reverend&#xD;
Nr. Stokes for the sum now due for the pulpit-&#xD;
overing, being, if I am correctly informed, some&#xD;
ev teen dollars and sixty-four cents, principal&#xD;
n  interest. I wish merely to state the state-&#xD;
ment that I know the party in question. I have&#xD;
haved hinm for the past two years, and I frank-&#xD;
y confess that I never have liked him, but on&#xD;
he contrary, believe him to be a raskel, and so&#xD;
o say, bummer of long standing. His beard is&#xD;
of the meanest, stiffest kind I ever had to deal&#xD;
with, and he has four warts that I lave to go&#xD;
round, occupying twice as much tilin as any&#xD;
other customer"&#xD;
"Very good, broder Goliab. Dat's to de&#xD;
point! You all heard brodgr Goliah?    Very&#xD;
well.  De collection for de pulpit-cloth will&#xD;
now be took up at once afore we commence.&#xD;
Brother Claret, you just lock de doors, and I hope&#xD;
none of de members present will be gettin' out&#xD;
of de windows disgracefully, as dey did Sunday&#xD;
afore last ",,&#xD;
Through the precautions enjoined by the wor-&#xD;
thy pastor upon brother Claret, the sexton, an&#xD;
individual with a remarkable nose, spread upon&#xD;
his face like butter upon bread, the collection&#xD;
was a success, and the clergyman's mind was re-&#xD;
lieved of weight and made free for the coinig&#xD;
duties of the evening. Let us in consonance with&#xD;
our hero's feelings regard with decorum those&#xD;
proceedings which, however tinctured with the&#xD;
ludicrousness of inferior intelligence, should be all&#xD;
the more respected for the indispensability of its&#xD;
presence. Our business is principally to mark&#xD;
the progress of our chief character in his lauda-&#xD;
ble pursuit of a varied knowledge of the differ-&#xD;
ent classes of human beings, and collaterally to&#xD;
relate the progress of the relations existing be-&#xD;
tween the other characters of this work. We&#xD;
are thus enabled to pass over the ensuing scene&#xD;
of regenerating the aged backslider with slight&#xD;
allusion, though Moses observed in it all the&#xD;
likely confusion and, so to say, uproar, in over-&#xD;
coming the persistent obstinacy of the old gen-&#xD;
tleman. He there saw that even the generous&#xD;
prosecution of the compassionate works of reli-&#xD;
gious zeal is as likely to be accompanied with&#xD;
expressions of anger, wrangling, and even phys-&#xD;
ical methods of enforcement as are the aims and&#xD;
objects of the most ordinary worldly desires.&#xD;
"Such is the incongruous working of human&#xD;
nature 1" thought he as he gazed in philosophic&#xD;
earnestness upon the scene. "Zeal for his mor al&#xD;
welfare is really leading them even to endanger&#xD;
his life, and their own amicable relations with&#xD;
each other !"&#xD;
An immersion in water had been considered&#xD;
indispensAble to the complete redemption of the&#xD;
unfortunate brother by all parties met there for&#xD;
the saike of his spiritual welfare, and it was this&#xD;
measure in particular that the brother himself&#xD;
objected to. By the efforts of the pastor and of&#xD;
Mr. Lommeydew, and by the fatigue of the ex-&#xD;
citement to which his aged being was being sub-&#xD;
jected, he had consented to disavow his late se.&#xD;
&#xD;
Kar&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WI&#xD;
cret practices, when the mention of this measure&#xD;
caused him at once to return to his previous ob-&#xD;
stinacy of demeanor. Hence a terrible uproar&#xD;
ensued, during which the disorganized eithusi-&#xD;
asm of both brethren and sisters had become so&#xD;
intense that the reverend Mr. Stokes was forced&#xD;
to return to his pulpit for the purpose of re-&#xD;
storing order. During his catechism and ener.&#xD;
getic clerical entreaties by the side of the crimi-&#xD;
nal octogenarian, a worthy old brother, who&#xD;
had in vain endeavored to break into the&#xD;
ring, sought relief for his feelings by taking pos-&#xD;
session of the vacant desk and giving out a&#xD;
hymn which he thought would be adapted to re-&#xD;
store a union of the zealous forces.'~ As he had&#xD;
'frequently to stop and spell the harder words&#xD;
thereof, the time thus lost only added to the con-&#xD;
fusion, and such of the members as were endeav-&#xD;
primg to assist him by lifting their voices in the&#xD;
song, were about giving it up as useless froni&#xD;
the imsuperable want of concert, when the pastor&#xD;
arrived at and ejected the brother from the pul-&#xD;
pit* with a peremptory deprecation of the irreg-&#xD;
ularity of the proceeding.  The brother glared,&#xD;
with some natural indignation upon his pastor,&#xD;
at the forcible manner in which his expulsion&#xD;
was accomplished, but became softened in -his&#xD;
feelings as soon as he observed order was being&#xD;
restoted. The energette ctergyman, throngb the&#xD;
customary respect which was paid his character,&#xD;
quieldy enforced his homely commands for&#xD;
silence and order, and was proceeding to report&#xD;
with partial- gratification the progress of the&#xD;
work, when a renewed commotion was again vis-&#xD;
ible in the neighborhood of the penitent's pew.&#xD;
Moses immediately observed the deacons sur-&#xD;
rounded by a crowd, carrying the faintly strug-&#xD;
glin~g octogenarian in a horizontal position to the&#xD;
vestry at the rear of the church. In a moment&#xD;
of exhausted nature he had consented to the ob-&#xD;
jectionable -measure, and they had resolved to&#xD;
hurry hin at once into the vestry and immnorse&#xD;
him there ere his expected exelaniations of ter-&#xD;
giversation should become too heavy to be pass-&#xD;
ed unnoticed. Brunswick here slipped quietly&#xD;
back to Moses's side from the body of the church,&#xD;
where lie had been endeavoriing to rationally as-&#xD;
sist in the ceremonies. His step-mother, unex-&#xD;
pecteily to him, was not present. Perhaps from&#xD;
a delicate desire to avoid impeding the proceed-&#xD;
ings, through any feelings of irritation, which the&#xD;
person whose crime she had detected might have&#xD;
at her presence. The - pastor, who had hastily&#xD;
been called from the pulpit, now emerged from&#xD;
the vestry-room and announced that the evening's'&#xD;
efforts of the fiock had been crowned with the&#xD;
desired success. Thereupon great rejoicing en-&#xD;
sued through the assemblage, and the usual rev-&#xD;
erent pieces of music were sung with earnest en-&#xD;
thusiasrn. The sincerity, the honest piety and&#xD;
the fervent desire for a fellow-being's welfare&#xD;
manifested by all touched Moses's heart. He&#xD;
stood up also with Brunswick, and sang the&#xD;
grand Old Hundredth with a tear of humanity&#xD;
and reverence glistening in his eye. lie was not&#xD;
such as could hear that illustrious hymn sung&#xD;
with time magmiificenit voices mind the fervid, heart-&#xD;
felt devotion of this humble race, unaffected, or&#xD;
without a desire to teach them tile glories of a&#xD;
higher intelligence, and render them capable of&#xD;
a mere imntellectual adoration of the Maker.&#xD;
Tire pi-oceedings were now about being ration-&#xD;
&#xD;
NKFIELD.                                 141&#xD;
ally brought t a close, from the natural desire&#xD;
of the audience to indulge in an inspection and&#xD;
congratulation of the object of the. evening's ef-&#xD;
forts, and familiar colloquy thereupon. But ere&#xD;
the doxology was sung the reverend pastor ap-&#xD;
peared to have still another matter of import-&#xD;
anee upon his mind, a matter which be proceed-&#xD;
ed to state would deeply interest all of his con-&#xD;
gregation, especially as it concerned the future&#xD;
happiness of two worthy members of the church&#xD;
and betoved social acquaintances, one of whom&#xD;
had on that evening been principally concerned,&#xD;
and ardently energetic in the efforts connected&#xD;
with the welfare of the aged brother.&#xD;
"And I now take opportunity," continued he,&#xD;
with a significant smile and pleasant circumspec-&#xD;
tion of all the faces turned toward him, "1 joy-&#xD;
fully take opportunity of congratulatin' the two&#xD;
upon dere proposed felic'tous union. I now an-&#xD;
nounce in 'cordance with my custom as pastor of&#xD;
de church de affiancement of Mr. Jinks Lommey-&#xD;
dew and Mistis Previous Difficults, to take place&#xD;
on de fith of do next mont proximo. De bred-&#xD;
ren will congrattlelate de happy bridegroom after&#xD;
de services !'&#xD;
Brunswick started convulsively from his seat.&#xD;
A semi-subdued utterance of angry denial was&#xD;
about escaping from his lips, and a contemplated&#xD;
precipitation of his person over the gallery-rail-&#xD;
ing was manifested, when Moses restrained hin.&#xD;
He had been, in the strong language of the ver-&#xD;
nacular, "sucked in!" And what was worse, he&#xD;
knew his master saw he had been. What was&#xD;
the authoritative manner which had lately been&#xD;
exhibited by his step-mother toward her lover,&#xD;
but the anticipation of conjugal habits? Why&#xD;
was so much anxiety displayed by the lover in&#xD;
effecting an immediate conversion of his aged&#xD;
relative ? The consent to a public announcement&#xD;
of the engagement was conditional upon it. Ay,&#xD;
even the delicacy of the infatuated lady in wi-&#xD;
framinng from the meeting was now easily ac-&#xD;
counted for by this aspect of her relations.&#xD;
In vain did the excited domestic seek permis-&#xD;
siot from his master to rejoin the crowd below,&#xD;
under the pretense of p i-rtaking in the usual&#xD;
harewell embracing and kissing. The fear of a&#xD;
collision between him and the divinity-student&#xD;
was too great to permit of it, and Moses ordered&#xD;
him to accompany him to the hotel,&#xD;
CHAPTER LXV.&#xD;
ARCADES AMBO.&#xD;
A PAY or two subsequent to his abrupt colli-&#xD;
sion with Mr. Bobby, at the Marrycomeup House,&#xD;
Mr. Titman began to feel so uncomfortable from&#xD;
the circumscription of his actions, which his&#xD;
prudence dictated to him, in reflecting upon the&#xD;
consequences of that event, that le longed ar-&#xD;
dently to confide his situation to some frend who&#xD;
might aid him with his advice, and fortify him&#xD;
with his sympathy. Mr. Winkfield, who would,&#xD;
1n0 doubt, should it be disclosed to him, undertake&#xD;
some such severe measure as that of promptly&#xD;
reporting his chronic fickleness to Miss Bobby,&#xD;
was ineligible. lie ther-efore sought Mr. Bar-&#xD;
nard. The latter at once demanded an explana.&#xD;
lion of Mr. Titman's late absences and pru-cc-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7256-00000072"/>&#xD;
pations, in particular on the occasion of his din-&#xD;
ner and as a proof of the intensity of his disap-&#xD;
pointment thereat, proceeded to knock the Dib-&#xD;
bletowner's head against the wall and threaten&#xD;
him with expulsion from the room through the&#xD;
window. Having thus relieved his feelings, he&#xD;
turned to listen to the little gentleman.&#xD;
"I have been lately making such an ass of&#xD;
myself, Barnard," commenced the latter, assum-&#xD;
ing a jocose air.&#xD;
" Of course ; but how ?" asked Mr. Barnard.&#xD;
" Ha ! ha! I have been allowing a fellow to&#xD;
oppose me in a delicate matter which I am pro.&#xD;
secuting," continued Mr. Titman, "all from a&#xD;
foolish notion of prudence and propriety, which&#xD;
I now see was entirely erroneous, entirely erro-&#xD;
neous !" And thereupon he disclosed his rela-&#xD;
tions with MissBobby, from the inception to the&#xD;
latest event, with alternations of solemnity, af-&#xD;
fectation of drollery, pathos, ferocity, and senti-&#xD;
mentality, which produced in his listener the one&#xD;
effect of continued risibility.&#xD;
"I know that hose comp any 20 pretty well,&#xD;
and I think I've seen that fellow with 'em very&#xD;
often," replied the latter _presently.  "Bobby!&#xD;
Let me see-he is a lanky, sandy, round-should&#xD;
ered boy, with a turn-up nose, and a mustache&#xD;
containing six hairs, isn't he?"&#xD;
"I think that is he. Yes," continued Mr. Tit-&#xD;
man, though he was not quite sure of the exact&#xD;
number of hairs.&#xD;
" Very well. Thrash him !" replied Mr. Bar-&#xD;
nard sententiously.  "Ha ! ha ! that's pretty&#xD;
good, the way that thief got ahead of you!"&#xD;
"But he is keeping out of the way! I haven't&#xD;
been able to meet him at all!" said Mr. Titman,&#xD;
who for the last two days had partaken of the&#xD;
air of heaven only at night, and that too in the&#xD;
most secluded portions of the city.&#xD;
" If you can't catch him at home, go around to&#xD;
the carriage-house. If I wasn't engaged now, I&#xD;
would go there at once and thrash him for&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"Thank you, thank you !" replied Mr. Titman,&#xD;
infected with valor by this kind sympathy.  " I&#xD;
rather think I shall reserve that pleasure for my-&#xD;
self, ha! ha !"&#xD;
Mr. Barnard gave him further fraternal advice,&#xD;
which produced in him such a wild daring that he&#xD;
immediately ran off and inspected the Marrycome-&#xD;
up House from an adjacent block. The next day&#xD;
he was congratulating himself that fate was re-&#xD;
lieving him of the painful duty of chastising Bob-&#xD;
by, by depriving him of the opportunity, was&#xD;
contemplating the possibility of renewing his&#xD;
visits to the Marrycomeup House, and was in the&#xD;
cheerful act of benevolently directing a street-&#xD;
beggar, who had accosted him for charity in Uni-&#xD;
versity-place, to the nearest eleemosynary soup-&#xD;
house, when he descried at some distance, behind&#xD;
two tree-boxes in the street, that interesting per-&#xD;
son whom Mr. Barnard had described as having&#xD;
become round-shouldered from the weight of his&#xD;
mustache, accompanied by a friend, and they&#xD;
both appeared to be enjoying the pleasure of dog-&#xD;
ging his footsteps. He darted agitatedly around&#xD;
the corner, with preternatural velocity, gained&#xD;
and turned the next one, bolted into an open&#xD;
passage-way of a house half-way down the block,&#xD;
and mounted ~to the second story. It was the&#xD;
dining-room of a French restaurant, and the only&#xD;
person therein was a solitary gargor&#xD;
&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Pea-a-soup, sare. Purse, Monsieur ?" asked&#xD;
the active waiter, emulating Mr. Titman's brisk-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
"Yes ! yes !" answered  Mr. Titman breath-&#xD;
lessly, as he sank in the chair of a table, and&#xD;
hurriedly peered out of the window at its side.&#xD;
That is-no, I don't want any."&#xD;
'D    *poison?  Feessh'?"&#xD;
"No! no!"&#xD;
Ah ! une eotelelle, ou de bile mets ?"&#xD;
Mr. Titman partly recovered his equanimity.&#xD;
He could see neither of the enemies in the street.&#xD;
He resolved to prolong the advantages of his re-&#xD;
treat by ordering dinner, though it was two hours&#xD;
before the proper period. The waiter lingered,&#xD;
dusted a chair with his napkin and wiped the&#xD;
plate, laid before Mr. Titman, in expectancy.&#xD;
" Look here ! What did you do that for? Don't&#xD;
do that again !" said the latter distractedly.&#xD;
" Oh ! it is an old chair only, and will not :re-&#xD;
ceive of the damage !" explained the domestic&#xD;
affably.  "Le roti done! Roast-a-bif ou mut-&#xD;
ting ?"'       .&#xD;
" Wee. That is, the buif-roty, and les pota-&#xD;
Ves, you.know, and a cup of strong tea."&#xD;
"acre / Du the' avee le roti?  Diable I"&#xD;
"Wee !"&#xD;
"1Bien, bien!/ Monsieur."&#xD;
While the waiter was absent in fulfilling his&#xD;
order, Mr. Titman concluded to again look out of&#xD;
the window into the street.  There was an un-&#xD;
dertaker's shop directly opposite.  He darted&#xD;
back in terror. In that shop he saw Mr. Bobby&#xD;
conversing with a shopman, while his friend, in&#xD;
a fire-coat, was looking up and down the street.&#xD;
'he first thought that struck him was that the&#xD;
former gentleman was considerately making ar-&#xD;
rangements for his coffin before he slaughtered&#xD;
him, and the second was, that they were undoubt.&#xD;
edly inquiring of the sexton for information.&#xD;
The dreadful likelihood of the latter having seen&#xD;
him enter the restaurant filled him, with renewed&#xD;
perturbation. As the waiter deposited the roast&#xD;
beef upon the cloth, Mr. Titman appealed to him&#xD;
at once:&#xD;
" You must not go away. Don't leave. I shall&#xD;
need you all the time !" said be vehemently.&#xD;
" Ah ! you take de regulaire course, den ? You&#xD;
eat 'em all?"&#xD;
"Wee, wee !" replied Mr. Titman hurriedly.&#xD;
"Pure'e ou soupe Julien, monsieur ?" asked&#xD;
the satisfied waiter, commencing de novo.&#xD;
" No, no, neither! That is, you stay here&#xD;
and-".,&#xD;
" Ah! Monsieur is eccentric, and eat 'em en'&#xD;
reves. You take cafe to commence, and soupe&#xD;
dernierement. Cafe noir ou au lait ?"&#xD;
" No, no. This will do. But I want you to&#xD;
stay by me, waiter. There is some difficulty.&#xD;
Dear sir, you are a most excellent waiter, and I&#xD;
am in danger I" replied Mr. Titman in incoherent&#xD;
fervor.&#xD;
"Comment en danger ?  There is some danger&#xD;
to eat? .Du tout. It is good, monsieur."  7&#xD;
" Oh no, vous comprenny, I wish you to stapd&#xD;
by me. Can you fight ?"&#xD;
"Hein? Pardon, monsieur," exclaimed the&#xD;
gargon, prudently recoiling a step or two at this&#xD;
question-.&#xD;
" Good God! I Itell you lam in danger l" roared&#xD;
Mr. Titman. " I expect to be killed ! There is&#xD;
some one waiting to attack me outside !"&#xD;
&#xD;
142&#xD;
&#xD;
,0&#xD;
&#xD;
" Then monsieur might pay his beel now, s'il  Fortune favors the brave.  The tower-bells&#xD;
vous plait !" suggested the waiter, commencing rang for a fire, and the foreman darted away.&#xD;
to show sympathetic alarm at this point.       "I demand satisfaction," resumed Mr. Bobby,&#xD;
" That is all right, and there is a half-dollar for who at this unexpected interpolation of chance&#xD;
yourself, waiter," replied Mr. Titman. " I want appeared to turn very pale too.&#xD;
your friendship, my good friend, to assist me, 0  "Allow me to explain," said Mr. Titman, a little&#xD;

cently.                                     "Give me the note of resignation and I'll let you&#xD;

never did believe in hastily dispatching his meals, "Note of resignation ? What, of my friendship&#xD;
and if he paused every five seconds of the hour with your sister ?"&#xD;
to gaze into the street, or consult with the waiter, "Yes !" replied Mr. Bobby, feigning to take a&#xD;

"Do you think there will be any need of&#xD;
surgeon ?" asked Mr. Titman feebly.&#xD;
"May be not. If you put your ball straigh&#xD;
through your man, Newton won't have much t&#xD;
do. But it is best to have him for form's sake."&#xD;
"But, good God, my dear sir, my man's bal&#xD;
may go straight through me !",.&#xD;
."It is a fact; if yours. don't go into him, hi&#xD;
will probably go into you !" replied Mr. Barnard&#xD;
comprehensively.  "However, I'll try to hav&#xD;
the sunwith you, my boy, and it will be an im&#xD;
mense advantage !"&#xD;
I feel it my duty to inform Winkfield of this&#xD;
matter, Barnard," exclaimed Titman solemnly.&#xD;
hIt is certainly my duty as a friend to inform&#xD;
him that-that I have felt it necessary to protect&#xD;
my interests in this-this terrible way, and see if&#xD;
he-"&#xD;
" Phaw! Don't you do any thing of the sort.&#xD;
He is opposed to duels, except when he wishes to&#xD;
fight one himself, confound him; and, my dear&#xD;
sir, he would rush at once-to the police-office&#xD;
and put a stop to it.  Just think of it !' ex-&#xD;
claimed Mr. Barnard in an alarmed manner.&#xD;
"I1have written a letter to my father. He&#xD;
lives alone on a farm four miles from Dibbletown.&#xD;
Is it right to deprive that aged man of the bright&#xD;
hope and comfort, to which he has been looking&#xD;
as the solace of his declining days, in the future&#xD;
career and rising prosperity of his only-"&#xD;
"Look here, Titman, is this the way to treat&#xD;
me for what I have done for you in this matter ?"&#xD;
asked Mr. Barnard, much irritated by Titman's&#xD;
show of feeling.  Bothering me about your ris-&#xD;
ing career, when you know I am doing the very&#xD;
best thingI can for it.. Stop your nonene, and&#xD;
attend to your business, or I'll knock you into&#xD;
the next story.",&#xD;
Still, as Mr. Titman appeared much depressed&#xD;
about his filial relations, the energetic guardian&#xD;
of the little gentleman's honor concluded to en-&#xD;
couragethim by alluding to the prospective pleas-&#xD;
ures of the excursion.&#xD;
"We'll have a pleasant sail up the East River,"&#xD;
said lie. "Tom Newton is full of jollity and an-&#xD;
ecdotes. lle'll tell you lots of 'em. We'll carry&#xD;
a lunch, and have some oysters before we go on&#xD;
the ground, and, my dear boy, cheer up, your old&#xD;
gentleman wouldn't object to your enjoying your-&#xD;
self, if he was here."&#xD;
Mr. Titman made a partially successful effort,&#xD;
and presently, with a renewed injunction from&#xD;
Barnard to cautiously refrain from disclosing the&#xD;
matter to Moses, betook himself from Mr. Bar-&#xD;
nard's chambers-in which the conversation oc-&#xD;
curred-to his own room, there to seek moment-&#xD;
ary tranquillity by shutting in his being from the&#xD;
world, and shuttirwg out his mind from his being.&#xD;
As the day approached, however, he might have&#xD;
discovered the affair to Moses by ius looks, had&#xD;
our hero not been absorbed himself in a private&#xD;
matter, and superficially attributed his friend's&#xD;
depression to bilicasness or some other tempo-&#xD;
raiy physical d rangement. A kind of numbness&#xD;
of intellect hattaken possession of the wretched&#xD;
SDibbktow ner. His actions by day had been the&#xD;
Miechaical obedience of Mr. Barnard's directions;&#xD;
but Nm the still watches of the night, when his&#xD;
e' itment was purified by the seclusion of his&#xD;
-own' chamber and the darkness, his spiritual cir-&#xD;
al effrtns  s eetyaroused to drive away&#xD;
aleorsat sleep or personal composure. If he&#xD;
&#xD;
a convulsively started up once frqm his couch, he&#xD;
did so fifty times; and when he started up, he&#xD;
t usually concluded his efforts at nervous relief by&#xD;
o turning partial summersets thereon, or performing&#xD;
other complicated gymnastic feats which in an or-&#xD;
1 diary state of mind would have been perhaps im-&#xD;
possible. The one idea of future danger became at&#xD;
s last a kind of physical lump in his system, moun-&#xD;
I tainous and iqpmovable ; not as though he had a&#xD;
c single bullet in an unextractable place therein,&#xD;
- but as if about three hundred tons of lead had&#xD;
been deposited there.&#xD;
The day arrived, and the sail up the river was,&#xD;
what Mr. Barnard anticipated, truly delightful.&#xD;
That is, when considered apart from the object&#xD;
for which it was instituted. The air was balmy,&#xD;
the water gently rippling, and the party extreme-&#xD;
ly sociable. The surgeon was drunk, but his in-&#xD;
ebriation was of that affable kind which is so&#xD;
often held to be a partial palliation for the condi-&#xD;
tion. He kindly displayed his instruments to&#xD;
Mr. Titman, explained the nature and variety of&#xD;
gunshot wounds, exemplified the method of treat-&#xD;
ing compound fractures, extracting bullets, am-&#xD;
putation, etc., by manipulations of the latter's&#xD;

anatomy,.until that gentleman madly gave up the&#xD;
ineffectual use of brandy and other powerful&#xD;
stimulants, and secretly resolved to abscond to&#xD;
the woods as soon as the vessel' touched the&#xD;
shore. When it arrived, however, he was totally&#xD;
unable to put his project into execution. More&#xD;
dead than alive, he was supported by Mr. Bar-&#xD;
nard and another gentleman to the field of battle,&#xD;
where his legs doubled up entirely and he reclined&#xD;
against a tree to occupy his time with closed&#xD;
eyes in wishing he was back in Dibbletowrn and&#xD;
awaiting the arrival of his antagonist. The ferry-&#xD;
boat performed its second trip, crc the other&#xD;
party arrived, but they finally were descried in&#xD;
the distance, slowly wending their way to the&#xD;
place of meeting. They, too, were evidently ex-&#xD;
periencing some difficulty in bringing their bellig-&#xD;
erent to the field, even more tham their opponents&#xD;
had undergopme; for, whereas Mr. Titman requiired&#xD;
only two to support him, such was Mr. Bobby's&#xD;
condition, that lie could be carried by no less&#xD;
than four. Of course, under such circumstances,&#xD;
there was extraordinary embarrassment in placing&#xD;
the 'men.  A constant succession of awkward&#xD;
reversals, droppings, and premature and danger-&#xD;
ous discharges of their weapons by both, ensued,&#xD;
which aroused the impatience of the spectators,&#xD;
drew forth thoughtless remarks from many of&#xD;
them, and well-nigh exhausted the perseverance&#xD;
of the two seconds. In addition, Mr. Barnard&#xD;
had commenced to feel a very uncomfortable&#xD;
sympathy for his friend, a state of feeling which&#xD;
was very naturally being converted into increased&#xD;
antipathy to, and irritation at, the stalwart fore-&#xD;
man, who was Mr. Bobby's second.&#xD;
"My man offers to apologize," said the latter&#xD;
to Barnard, "if -your'n will fust state there was&#xD;
no cause for sendin' him a challenge !"&#xD;
"Well, lie won't do that !" said Mr. Barnard&#xD;
vehemently.&#xD;
" Of course aot. 'Taint according to rules, any&#xD;
how," replied the foreman.&#xD;
" What the devil do you know about rules ?"&#xD;

"Suppose you keep your jaw to yourself."      "I don't wish to," said Titman candidly. "I&#xD;

whole party to return in the sail-boat. Some&#xD;
wrangling occurred upon the voyage back, be-&#xD;
tween the two seconds, respecting the imperfect&#xD;
skill which the foreman of Twenty displayed in&#xD;
managing the ropes, which had been magnani-&#xD;
mously proffered him by Mr. Barnaxfd; and, in&#xD;
endeavoring to furnish him, notwithstanding the&#xD;
crowded state of the boat, with a due knowledge&#xD;
thereof, by physically driving it into his head,&#xD;
the champion of Five knocked the other over-&#xD;
board and fell-over himself. There the original&#xD;
contest between them seemed likely to be renewed&#xD;
in all its vigor; but after splashing and fighting&#xD;
in the water for some time like a couple of en-&#xD;
raged seals, they were induced to return to the&#xD;
vessel, which proceeded onward, and at last&#xD;
safely reached its destination at the city dock.-&#xD;
We could wish to have been able to proceed&#xD;
and show to the reader interested in the career&#xD;
of the gallant Dibbletowner, that, with all the&#xD;
difficulties and obstructions to the prosecution of&#xD;
his suit for the hand of Miss Bobby, thus hap-&#xD;
pily removed, he pursued this delicate object of&#xD;
his wishes to a successful conclusion. But what&#xD;
will that reader say, when we plainly state that&#xD;
we can not;' and that it was the incurable fickle-&#xD;
ness of the gentleman himself which shortly&#xD;
brought it to an untoward close?  We will quote&#xD;
the words of the victim himself of this singular&#xD;
weakness, to explain the unhappy matter.&#xD;
"It was in the Park, Moses," said he to our&#xD;
hero.  "Dear me, I never experienced such a&#xD;
mysterious, inexplicable revulsion.  We were&#xD;
driving along with another lady and gentleman&#xD;
from the Marrycomeup House, when, just as we&#xD;
reached the border of the lake, we met her cousin&#xD;
in a tilbury, a most blushing creature of seven-&#xD;
teen, who cast a fatal, roguish smile at me! It&#xD;
was useless, Moses. I endeavored to conceal my&#xD;
feelings for, weeks thereafter, but Moffaitina at&#xD;
last discovered them, and it was all over. Hea.&#xD;
vens t but perhaps the consolation of her sweet&#xD;
cousin's society may hereafter afford me some re-&#xD;
lief for the distraction I now suffer!" -&#xD;
It was true. Miss Bobby discovered his incon-&#xD;
.stancy, and frankly confessing that she herself&#xD;
had been for some time filled with misgivings&#xD;
that a person of his ferocious, warlike, and bellig-&#xD;
erent disposition might not be suitable to her&#xD;
temperament, requested him to relinquish the&#xD;
further prosecution of his suit, and shortly after-&#xD;
ward rendered any such measures useless, by&#xD;
marrying, in great satisfaction, a consumptive&#xD;
widower, with an ample establishment, which in-&#xD;
eluded two children, one of whom was as old as&#xD;
herself.&#xD;
CHAPTER LXVIII.&#xD;
MosES, CONSULTING WITH BESSIE, DECIDES UPON&#xD;
THE DESTINATION OF THE NOTES.&#xD;
THE day after Moses's last interview with the&#xD;
collector, Mr. Wawbull was seated in his parlor,&#xD;
absorbed in a profound meditation.&#xD;
"It is a most singular state of affairs," solilo-&#xD;
quized the old gentleman, " not only that he&#xD;
should be engaged in matters for which I have&#xD;
always supposed him entirely unfitted, but that&#xD;
he should be thus engaged in set opposition to&#xD;
&#xD;
me. I respect his attachment to principles, but&#xD;
the devil take his principles! It seems useless&#xD;
to- attempt to persuade him or even question&#xD;
him, and the most exasperating thing about the&#xD;
whole matter is the astute air of candor and&#xD;
frankness under which he so adroitly hides his&#xD;
designs. Hallo! here he is again," concluded the&#xD;
exercised politician, as the mysterious object of&#xD;
his vexed reflections entered his presence once&#xD;
more.&#xD;
"1I was engaged last night, so I have to pay my&#xD;
last evening's visit this morning," said the latter&#xD;
gayly.&#xD;
"(Heavens! Witir the collector, I'll bet my&#xD;
head.) Yes, Moses, and undqubtedly your even-&#xD;
ing was occupied in more important matters than&#xD;
those which would have led you here. There is&#xD;
no use disguising it, Moses."&#xD;
"My dear Mr. Wagbull, I presume, of course,&#xD;
that you refer to my relations with the collector,"&#xD;
said Moses, calmly but earnestly ; "whatever&#xD;
your conjectures may have been thereon, I hope&#xD;
to convince you, when I assure you solemnly that&#xD;
my sole intention therein is but the one simple,&#xD;
ardent wish to provide my friend, Mr. Lampson,&#xD;
with-"&#xD;
" Again ! Very well, very well "&#xD;
"My interest in this matter may seem to be&#xD;
too intense, but I feel conscious that, were you&#xD;
acquainted with the noble character and unfortu-&#xD;
nate situation of a scholar, who-"&#xD;
" Look here, my dear Moses; enough of this.&#xD;
I respect your attachment to principle--deeply&#xD;
respect it; and I confess that I have been wrong&#xD;
in refusing to accord to you the possession of&#xD;
that peculiar intellectual ability which is so justly&#xD;
esteemed as one of the most brilliant gifts which&#xD;
can be bestowed upon man. My judgment of&#xD;
your character has been in error, and I hasten to&#xD;
repair it. Your attachment to my daughter, then,&#xD;
comes back in its fullest force, and I can see no&#xD;
obstacle to its natural fulfillment now. Yes, Mo-&#xD;
ses, confess to me frankly the true relations&#xD;
which exist between you and the collector, and I&#xD;
at once give my warm consent to your marriage&#xD;
with Bessie."&#xD;
"My dear, kind friend," said Moses in deep&#xD;
emotion, "I could, for this unexpected generosi-&#xD;
ty, throw myself at your feet, but-"&#xD;
"What! are you still hesitating?"&#xD;
" No. But such a happiness-so unexpected,&#xD;
after what you told me yesterday! I desire an&#xD;
instant to collect myself."&#xD;
Very right, very right, Moses."&#xD;
(" HeavensI What a position I am placed inI&#xD;
I not only don't know myself, but would like ex-&#xD;
tremely to find out from him something about&#xD;
the'confounded business. If I tell him the exact&#xD;
truth, he'll be sure not to believe me; and if I&#xD;
do not, my hopes are to be turned to gloom and&#xD;
despair. As I have nothing to communicate, I'll&#xD;
refuse to divulge.")&#xD;
" Well, have you decided ?" asked Mr. Wagbull&#xD;
in a tender manner, leering at Moses.&#xD;
"Yes, Mr. Wagbull, I have. It is to remain&#xD;
worthy of your esteem that I have resolved to&#xD;
remain silent. It is a severe conflict of feelings,&#xD;
but I must-I must," replied Moses, feeling very&#xD;
sincere.&#xD;
" Heavens ! You refuse-you refuse the hand&#xD;
of one whom you love I You contemn my benevo-&#xD;
lence I"&#xD;

CHAPTER LXIX.&#xD;
MOsEs TAEs rHEN OTEs TO TNE EWSPAPERS.&#xD;
AFTER inquiring into the status of the news-&#xD;
papers in question, to fortify his convictions that&#xD;
their editors were "the right men" referred to&#xD;
by the collector, and learning that they were both&#xD;
devoted to the popular cause of the administra-&#xD;
tion, but were exercising their usual professional&#xD;
violence and antagonism on the minor point of&#xD;
the municipal nomination, which had been tempo-&#xD;
rarily exaggerated into a mountain of import-&#xD;
ance, Moses cautiously sought, under the cover&#xD;
of a late evening hour, the editorial smithery of&#xD;
the organ of the Conkey faction, and confidently&#xD;
handed one of the communications he had re-&#xD;
ceived from the collector to the person whom he&#xD;
supposed to be the chief Cyclops, and whom he&#xD;
thus designated by the preeminent amount of&#xD;
dirt and printing-ink upon his face and disorder&#xD;
of his person. The agitation-of surprise, delight,&#xD;
and triumph appeared upon the visage and in the&#xD;
manner of the editor as he broke the seal of the&#xD;
note and read its contents. As he finished, he&#xD;
handed the document to another party present,&#xD;
apparently his assistant Titan, with the exulting&#xD;
exclamation:0&#xD;
"Sniggery, we have triumphed V"&#xD;
The assistant received the note, read it, re-&#xD;
moved the green shade from his eyes in order&#xD;
that he might grin more expressively, and then&#xD;
began to scratch himself in-various parts of his&#xD;
person, partly for the purpose of further express-&#xD;
ing his defight and partly as a relaxation from&#xD;
his labors.&#xD;
"In sending directly to us, the collector in-&#xD;
tnds that this important communication should&#xD;
be published at once, eh ?" said the journalist to&#xD;
Moses, subduing his ecstasy.&#xD;
" Yes, yes, of course. It is undoubtedly to be&#xD;
inferred from that mere fact," replied Moses,&#xD;
scratching his head.&#xD;
"Very well, we will put it in the first column&#xD;
of the morning's issue," replied the editor, rub-&#xD;
bing his hands; "assure him of that."&#xD;
Fine composition, sir, said Moses, lingering;&#xD;
finely worded."&#xD;
" Yes. It is rather short; but there is matter&#xD;
enough; and in the matter lies-its eloquence,"&#xD;
said the editor elatedly.&#xD;
" Perhaps in reading it aloud you will observe&#xD;
its peculiarring," suggested Moses again, under&#xD;
the influence of his curiosity.&#xD;
'Yes," replied the editor, " read aloud or si-&#xD;
i mtly, it will ring before to-morrow night over&#xD;
the whole city, and wring the bosom of the poor&#xD;
creature to whom, once honored and trusted as a&#xD;
member of the great party which he now openly&#xD;
abandons and conspires to overthrow, we feel&#xD;
abundantly able most efficiently to teach a lesson&#xD;
without resorting to defamation. We think we&#xD;
have been long enough in the harness to know&#xD;
that what we have to do is to discuss principles,&#xD;
and not bespatter with malignant reproaches or&#xD;
disparaging epithets. And in defending the in-&#xD;
terests of human progress, of education, and of&#xD;
temperance, we know we have not failed, in our&#xD;
long and arduous career, to avoid the discourtesy,&#xD;
the ribaldry, the supererogatory rudeness and&#xD;
impertinence which the more decent of the readl-&#xD;
ers of our unexceptionable (God save the mark !)&#xD;
cotemporary have been obliged to lately swallow&#xD;
&#xD;
in perusing the cooldeliberate, wicked, and&#xD;
wanton lies of this despicable imbecile, this&#xD;
wretched villain and poor, abject tool, who either&#xD;
has been or will be bought cheap by the rum-&#xD;
selling swindlers, guzzling sots, and locofoco fos-&#xD;
sils who infest the grog-shops and fill the jails&#xD;
of the community.  -&#xD;
Here the experienced journalist paused in his&#xD;
nervous eloquence, and examined his table for&#xD;
the purpose of finding the vigorous slip which&#xD;
he had been recently amusing himself by in-&#xD;
diting, and from which he was quoting; but fail-&#xD;
ing in his search, he gave up his intention of&#xD;
proceeding, and generously asked Moses to take&#xD;
a glass of water, that liquid being the only one&#xD;
which was ever permitted, or permitted to re-&#xD;
main, in the office. Moses would fain have&#xD;
staid longer to gratify his curiosity; but as he&#xD;
again saw symptoms of rising gall, which he felt&#xD;
appeared -to be among politicians unpleasantly&#xD;
strong, he resumed his caution and repressed any&#xD;
further impulses of his curiosity until the mor-&#xD;
row, when in all probability the nature of the&#xD;
singular events in which lie had been engaged&#xD;
would at last be disclosed to him. He therefore&#xD;
declined the nectar which had been offered him,&#xD;
and retired. From the office of the Conkey or-&#xD;
gan he sought the fulminating garret of the&#xD;
Tricker party. There he placed the remaining&#xD;
communication in the hand of the chief person-&#xD;
age present, whom he distinguished as such upon&#xD;
the principle which. he had applied at the other&#xD;
establishment, and who was a trifle dirtier than&#xD;
the one thereat. The same succession of sur-&#xD;
prise, delight, and triumph appeared in this gen-&#xD;
tleman's countenance-at least on that part of it&#xD;
which was not covered with dirt and ink. Moses&#xD;
began to feel highly satisfied too.&#xD;
" Yes, Bessie was right, thought he; "it is&#xD;
evidently some compromise-some clever stroke&#xD;
by the great politician for the restoration of har.&#xD;
mony in the party. Both wings are satisfied."&#xD;
As the collector has intrusted this to us di-&#xD;
rectly, sir," said this editor, after his moment of&#xD;
meditative rapture, "he has undoubtedly wished&#xD;
that we should publish it."&#xD;
"Yes-that is-certainly," replied Moses, besi-&#xD;
tating, with some momentary misgiving at this&#xD;
point, arising from the singular coincidence of&#xD;
this question with the other editor's.&#xD;
" It shall appear in the first column, in double&#xD;
caps. Present my compliments and the common&#xD;
gratitude of the party to the collector, and tell&#xD;
him this. And by heaven! take sonic refresh-&#xD;
ment, sir-take some refreshmer..  Biggs, bring&#xD;
forth the glasses from the closet."&#xD;
The sub-editor appealed to looked significantly&#xD;
at his chief, and then whispered to him.&#xD;
"I am sorry that we have nothing to offer&#xD;
you," continued the chief to Moses, " but some&#xD;
petroleum-wine, made from coal-oil-an advertis-&#xD;
ing sample, which I am obliged to pronounce&#xD;
dangerous, as I have tried it."&#xD;
"Oh! never mind. By the way," said Moses,&#xD;
"you will, of course read over the communica-&#xD;
tion and see that the punctuation is correct, or&#xD;
perhaps I now might do so. Allow me."&#xD;
" Oh! no; of course, we will attend to that.&#xD;
Yes, sir ; the points will be properly put in, sir.&#xD;
The chief point is already there, sir. It is that,&#xD;
sir, which puts a period-a full stop, sir-to the&#xD;
insane malignancy andn futile arrogance of our&#xD;

&#xD;
benevolent-ha, ha !-cotemporary.  It is that w&#xD;
which belies his predictions, baffles his expecta- g&#xD;
tions, squelches his invocations, deranges his cal-&#xD;
culations, and inhabilitates his nominations. (The t&#xD;
frenzy is coming on me. Stand by, Biggs, and m&#xD;
take down in short-hand what I have to say. If s&#xD;
there is any thing which can't be substantiated, I&#xD;
can lay the article on you.) No longer, incensed i&#xD;
to madnes, full of sound and fury, and with&#xD;
equal bitterness and disregard of truth, will he&#xD;
dare to assail his betters; nor longer pile accusa-&#xD;
tion upon accusation of the true conservators of c&#xD;
the party with that energy which he fain would s&#xD;
hide in what we must paradoxically mark as ad&#xD;
prurient modesty and arrogant humility, ands&#xD;
which only his secret and private malice may&#xD;
explain. Outstripping all fibbers in indifference&#xD;
to the truth of facts, let him eclipse Munchausenv&#xD;
in the extravagance of his conceptions; but thec&#xD;
disgraceful spectacle which he has presented to t&#xD;
decent'people as the great philanthropist, whoseI&#xD;
only philanthropy lies in the futility of his ma-&#xD;
levolence, the scoundrelly, malignant, doting, I&#xD;
raving-"I&#xD;
"Yes, I will," interrupted Moses, recovering&#xD;
himself ; " I had better go immediately, certainly.I&#xD;
And good evening-good evening, sir."&#xD;
With these words Moses fled from the office,t&#xD;
and, proceeding to his couch, calmly awaited the&#xD;
morrow's developments.&#xD;
Who shall picture the astonishment, confusion,&#xD;
and dismay of both the above editors-of all theI&#xD;
persons, high and low, attached to their respect-&#xD;
ive establishments-of all the admirers of each,&#xD;
of Conkey and Tricker themselves, of the entire&#xD;
Conkey and entire Tricker faction-nay, the in.&#xD;
tense excitement, risible and otherwise, of the&#xD;
whole city, upon reading in the next morning's&#xD;
issue of each of these papers, the following ef-&#xD;
forts in the polite epistolary line from that high&#xD;
and mighty political potentate, the collector.&#xD;
In the first column of the Conkey organ:&#xD;
"The Collector presents his compliments to&#xD;
the faithful adherent of the true Republican&#xD;
cause in the coming municipal contest in this&#xD;
city. You are hereby authorized to assure the&#xD;
friends of your candidate for the important office&#xD;
of the mayoralty of the city attached to the chief&#xD;
port of entry of the nation that it is the intention&#xD;
of the Collector to wannly and earnestly support&#xD;
that candidate in the coming contest."&#xD;
(Signed.)&#xD;
In the Tricker organ:&#xD;
"The Collector congratulates the firm and un-&#xD;
wavering agent of the true interests of Republic-&#xD;
anism. He takes pleasure in assuring him that&#xD;
the candidate whose cause he is asserting, and&#xD;
who must undoubtedly be regarded as the ex-&#xD;
ponent of patriotic principles, Republican mea-&#xD;
sures, and municipal prosperity, may rely upon&#xD;
the entire moral and active influence of the Cot-&#xD;
lector in the approaching convention."&#xD;
(Signed.)&#xD;
We will not attempt to portray the feelings ok&#xD;
the various parties before mentioned upon com-&#xD;
paring these two notes; but itis our duty to&#xD;
chronicle the feelings of the worthy author him-&#xD;
self thereon,- as far as they were connected with&#xD;
our hero.&#xD;
He sent for Moses about the time the Intter&#xD;
&#xD;
ras agitatedly scratching his head in a gradually&#xD;
rowing illumination upon the matter.&#xD;
"Well, sir, what have you to say respecting&#xD;
his extraordinary publication ?" said he to Moses.&#xD;
with impressive sternness; "what have you to&#xD;
ay, sir?"&#xD;
" I-I took them myself to the editors," the&#xD;
ntimidated and penitent Moses began to confess,&#xD;
'and I supposed-"&#xD;
" It was, then, a feat originated and performed&#xD;
olely by you, sir ?" continued the collector in&#xD;
oncentrated excitement. "This presumption is&#xD;
omething new-it is something new in a subor-&#xD;
dinate, sir. Instead of giving these notes to the&#xD;
ecretary's agent in each wing, to secretly and&#xD;
quietly fortify the position and calm the impa-&#xD;
tience of each, until I could decide which one&#xD;
was the strongest and best to capture, you con-&#xD;
cluded that it could be more easily done through&#xD;
the diffusive facilities of the public press, eh?&#xD;
You thought you would kindly relieve us at the&#xD;
very outset of the necessity of going on at all-&#xD;
by heaven !-and dispense with all delay and go.&#xD;
betweens, by putting these notes in the hands of&#xD;
the public organs, and irrevocably commit me in&#xD;
favor of bot asides, without leaving me the slight-&#xD;
est chance of denying to the party at large and&#xD;
to the world this fine piece of stultification with&#xD;
which I have astonished them."&#xD;
Moses was about to make a clean breast of it,&#xD;
to make a sincere and heartfelt apology for his&#xD;
past unwarrantable acts, and to get out of the&#xD;
collector's office as best he could, when he was&#xD;
greatly surprised to see that official suddenly rub&#xD;
his hands, and to hear him make the following&#xD;
'remarks:&#xD;
" But I forgive you, sir; I forgive the presump-&#xD;
tion in my admiration of the brilliancy of the&#xD;
move."7   .&#xD;
" Eh ?" responded Moses in confusion; "I-&#xD;
I-"&#xD;
" Excellent, excellent. Undoubtedly the best&#xD;
thing that could have been done," continued the&#xD;
collector in apparent ecstasy; "I never should&#xD;
have thought of extricating myself from  the&#xD;
troublesome affair in such a manner-never. A&#xD;
masterly effort-a masterly piece of satire and&#xD;
diplomacy combined, sir. Ha ! ha ! How the&#xD;
secretary will laugh when it reaches Washington.&#xD;
But shake hands-shake hands, sir. It is un-&#xD;
equaled."&#xD;
And hereupon the undoubtedly overjoyed poli-&#xD;
tician shook the hand of the astonished amateur&#xD;
in political science most fervently.&#xD;
" It will add considerably to my reputation,&#xD;
sir-considerably," continued the politician, grow-&#xD;
ing in rapture; "shake hands again, sir! Why,&#xD;
how did you come to think of it? Let me see:&#xD;
by promising myself in favor of both, I of&#xD;
course mean that I do not take either side. To&#xD;
be sure, I have to take up that imbecile Noblock;&#xD;
but he is as good as any other blockhead to&#xD;
throw away the President's patronage upon. Yes,&#xD;
both the Conkeyites and the Tricker party will&#xD;
be delighted at finding the other has not got it.&#xD;
Glorious! They would rather have that than&#xD;
their own success. They will see it is a measure&#xD;
which my duty to the party dictated to me for its&#xD;
restoration to harmony ; and if they should not&#xD;
happen to like it, I can lay it to the President, ha !&#xD;
ha ! They will love and fear me, sir. Yes, sir.&#xD;
And the secretary will be gratified beyond meca-&#xD;
&#xD;
sure at my management. Shake hands, shake&#xD;
hands! To you I owe all."&#xD;
And again the pleased official expressed the&#xD;
ardor of his satisfaction in that primitive act of&#xD;
friendship for at least two minutes. .&#xD;
" I am undoubtedly a man of genius," thought&#xD;
the exalted Moses; " it is settled that I am a po-&#xD;
litical genius."&#xD;
" A desk is vacant in the inspection bureau.&#xD;
It is at your disposal," said the collector abrupt-&#xD;
ly, in the midst ol his delight; " but really, with&#xD;
such talents, you do not contemplate tying your-&#xD;
self to a clerkship, do you ?"&#xD;
" Oh I no, sir. A friend of mine, a worthy&#xD;
man and gentleman of education, sir-Mr. Joseph&#xD;
Lampson," replied Moses hastily, "has asked me&#xD;
to---"&#xD;
" Very well; say no more. I appoint Mr. Jo-&#xD;
seph Lampson a deputy inspector. And here-&#xD;
here is a note from me to him," replied the col-&#xD;
lector, at once rapidly inditing the appointment;&#xD;
"let him be at the Custom House to-morrow&#xD;
morning to be sworn in."&#xD;
" Yes, sir-yes, sir," replied the overjoyed Mo-&#xD;
ses ; " I will carry it to him at once. 1 would&#xD;
like to go immediately."&#xD;
" Very well, very well," continued the col-&#xD;
lector; "and I shall see you again soon, of&#xD;
course ?  Glorious, glorious!  A, great relief!1&#xD;
Shake hands before you go."&#xD;
Moses rushed at once with the appointment to&#xD;
his friend the scholar, and tholight of nothing&#xD;
else until he had placed it in his hands.&#xD;
It was as the collector predicted. The next&#xD;
morning two columns of editorial matter appear-&#xD;
ed in each of the rival organs, composed of ter-&#xD;
rific vituperation and slang abuse of each other,&#xD;
intermingled with taunts at the failure of each&#xD;
and congratulations to the party in general that&#xD;
the vile Conkey and the treacherous Tricker and&#xD;
their creatures had been read this severe lesson&#xD;
by that pure patriot and proud intellect, the collec-&#xD;
tor, for their infamous attempts at distracting thie&#xD;
party by their efforts at personal aggrandizement.&#xD;
As for the Hon. Luke Noblock, words can not&#xD;
express the sentiments of gratitude and friend-&#xD;
ship which he presently felt he had cause to en-&#xD;
tertain for our hero. He was triumphantly nomi-&#xD;
nated in the ensuing convention, and of course,&#xD;
from the state of parties at that period, ultiinate-&#xD;
ly elected. Learning from the collector himself&#xD;
Moses's valuable services in his interests, he took&#xD;
occasion one morning when Moses was with Mr.&#xD;
Wagbull at the Evercroft House to publicly&#xD;
thank him for his disinterested friendship shown&#xD;
in the matter. Mr. Wagbull, who, as a deter-&#xD;
mined Conkeyite, had been satisfied with the&#xD;
overthrow of the Tricker party, heard with feel-&#xD;
ings of gratification, respect, and awe the honor-&#xD;
able gentleman allude to Moses's efforts as the&#xD;
chief means by which his nomination was se-&#xD;
cured. In particular did the familiaAty of our&#xD;
hero with those great men, the editors, and lia&#xD;
visits to those sacred places, their sanctums, im-&#xD;
press the worthy old merchant with his political&#xD;
importance.&#xD;
" Why, he goes about their offices just as if he&#xD;
was walking in the street or in a hotel parlor,"&#xD;
whispered he to Mr. Barnard, who was standing&#xD;
near, and whom he momentarily interrupted in the&#xD;
pleasing occupation of contorting his visage at&#xD;
the worthy wearer of the municipal laurels,.&#xD;
&#xD;
-" Yes," replied the lively gentleman, "he&#xD;
doesn't mind the dirt there any more than in&#xD;
the other places."&#xD;
Whether Moses visited the collector again very&#xD;
soon, or whether he finally disclosed, or \"as corn-&#xD;
pelled to disclose, by the arrival of the true&#xD;
agent from Washington, the real position which&#xD;
he had occupied in the matter, or what measures the&#xD;
collector took with him, if so, to keep it a secret,&#xD;
it is, perhaps, immaterial to state. It is sufficient&#xD;
for us to know that Mr. Lampson continued to-&#xD;
hold his pleasant place in the Custom House,&#xD;
and that Moses, by the judicious advice of Bessie,&#xD;
kept quiet himself, and continued to enjoy the&#xD;
honors of an immense reputation among those in&#xD;
political circles who knew him, and particularly&#xD;
in the estimation of her father,&#xD;
CHAPTER LXX.&#xD;
NUPTIALS IN sUMMER LANE.&#xD;
A FEW days after the publication of the banns&#xD;
between Mrs. Difficult and her lover Moses re-&#xD;
ceived in his rooms a friendly deputation of col-&#xD;
ored gentlemen, members of the Shiloh church,&#xD;
who had kindly consented, in acerdance with&#xD;
the wishes of the couple, to take this niethod of&#xD;
removing the antipathy of  rn   io the r&#xD;
preaching union. From these gentlemen Mloses&#xD;
learned that his domestic had been latterly man-&#xD;
ifesting his repugnance to the proposed measure&#xD;
in an extremely violent and disagreeable manner&#xD;
at his parent's house. His conduct had become&#xD;
refractory and obstinate to the last degree, and&#xD;
to show that his downright objection to the&#xD;
match was irrevocable, lie had even gone so far&#xD;
as to challenge the exercised Lommydew, and&#xD;
upon the refusal of satisfaction by the latter, to&#xD;
brandish a dinner-knife at the table before him,&#xD;
to squeeze him in doorways, to utter indefinite&#xD;
threats against the continuance of his existence&#xD;
and to take other similar measures, which had at&#xD;
last rendered the visits of the groom to his fu-&#xD;
ture lady not only disagreeable, but even dan-&#xD;
gerous. While Moses heartily sympathized with&#xD;
the honest motives of Brunswick, he disapprov-&#xD;
ed of this violent method of obeying them, and&#xD;
promptly informed the committee, who took oc-&#xD;
casion to politely express their regard both for&#xD;
him and their friend Brunswick, that he would&#xD;
at once enjoin the latter to moderate his conduct&#xD;
to a reasonable degree. In accordance with this&#xD;
promise, he endeavored by a long disquisition&#xD;
upon the nature of human beings in general, and&#xD;
by a thorough analysis of the matter in hand, to&#xD;
point out to Brunswick that further resistance&#xD;
was useless. He stated that he had long fore-&#xD;
seen this determination of the suit, or else he&#xD;
would have more actively assisted him in at-&#xD;
tempting to thwart its progress. He had exam-&#xD;
ined the statutes, according to Brunswick's de-&#xD;
sire, for the purpose of discovering the legal&#xD;
prohibition of the marriage of widows whose&#xD;
former husband's remains had not been found.&#xD;
But there appeared to be no such ordinance&#xD;
among them, and in fact, none of any other&#xD;
kind which seemed applicable to the case. Bruns-&#xD;
wick, who had placed much reliance upon the&#xD;
possible interference of the authorities,.listenied&#xD;
with dejected conviction to the definite accents&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
154                         MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
of our hero, aid resignedly promised to obeyY&#xD;
his injunctions and abstain from further violent&#xD;
opposition to the marriage. - It was thus permit-&#xD;
ted to tranquilly approach its consummation.c&#xD;
A temporary postponement of the day had been t&#xD;
made in cons, quence of the sudden demise ofr&#xD;
Mr. Lommeydew's grandsire, who died revert-C&#xD;
ing to Mumbo Jumbo, undoubtedly from   the&#xD;
rheumatic effects of his religious ordeal at the&#xD;
church. But jas soon as the delicate feelings oft&#xD;
the young man were strengthened, the day was (&#xD;
again fixed, and happiness and excitement dur-I&#xD;
ing the ensuing preparations therefor reigned in&#xD;
the home of the fair bride. The- assistance and,&#xD;
advice of several of her lady friends were ofI&#xD;
course in constant requisition. There was muchI&#xD;
running to and fro between her mansion and an&#xD;
eminent thread and needle store in the-neighbor-I&#xD;
hood, and small dry-goods boys were constantly&#xD;
arriving at her front-door, while by such neigh-I&#xD;
bors as were inquisitive enough to gratify their&#xD;
curiosity in furtively peering through the blinds&#xD;
of her back-parlor window, an interesting con-&#xD;
clave of colored ladies might be seen working in&#xD;
silent earnestness, or vehemently discussing mat-&#xD;
ters of acknowledged importance to the sex un-&#xD;
der such circumstances, appertaining to the ap-&#xD;
propriate positions of the principals at the cere-&#xD;
mony, to the number of bridesmaids, to the al-&#xD;
ternative of solemnizing the event in a church,&#xD;
or of more quietly pqrforming it in a front-par-&#xD;
lor, to that of whether the bride should faint&#xD;
before or after the critical moment, etc. These&#xD;
and many other points suggested by the profound&#xD;
sense of etiqut-tte inherent in the female bosom&#xD;
were being settled by these friends, who had,&#xD;
constituted themselves, in parliamentary lan-&#xD;
guage, an executive committee, with arbitrary&#xD;
power to send for gin, oysters, sweetmeats, etc.&#xD;
Now and then Mr. Lomineydew attending&#xD;
these gatherings was archly made to spend an&#xD;
hour in reading to them during their work, from&#xD;
the Atlantic  monthly, the Ledger, or other or-&#xD;
gans of the intellectual fashions of the day,&#xD;
while they listened with languishing looks of sub-&#xD;
dued emotion after the most delicate style of&#xD;
their young lady mistresses.&#xD;
"That is a beautifully poem, Mr. Lommey-&#xD;
dew," one would say. "Fr6m whom ?".&#xD;
" Ah! a little thing originally written and pub-&#xD;
lished in Europe, by a blind man named Milton,&#xD;
and now republished by the chief poetess of the&#xD;
Monthly."&#xD;
"It is so mystery and elegance. Sweet I"&#xD;
"Yes, and she very cleverly obtains that ef-&#xD;
fect by leaving out every second line of the orig-&#xD;
inal and a decided improvement in the rimth,&#xD;
too I"&#xD;
" In what?  What de rimph?" inquires an&#xD;
honest Jersey matron, staring at the student, who&#xD;
immediately talks her into a state of silent admi-&#xD;
ration at his poetic acquirements.&#xD;
" But Mendelssohn 1- I likes Mendelssohn bet-&#xD;
ter. Oh ! how sleepy he is i" says another.,&#xD;
"Why, that's music, you fool!" replied the&#xD;
first., "That's lasick's music. It's the name&#xD;
of some of Classick's pieces.  We an't talkin'&#xD;
about music, Jenny. Why, what are you think-&#xD;
in' about i?"&#xD;
"I know. But my mistis says he is the most&#xD;
sleepy, aiid I like him !"&#xD;
"Dreamy, you mean. Sleepy I You're tooe&#xD;
&#xD;
young, Jenny, to come out already. Entirely too&#xD;
young -"&#xD;
"1 don't care, my mistis knows as much about&#xD;
dese tings as yourn," replies the other, and with&#xD;
this very true assertion, the reading of other&#xD;
pieces is resumed and the work of delight is ar-&#xD;
dently prosecuted.&#xD;
With a delicate regard for Brunswick's feel-&#xD;
ngs Moses's name was inserted in the list of&#xD;
those of the bride's friends, and a wedding-&#xD;
card of mammoth proportion Was duly received&#xD;
by him, which he pleasantly acknowledged by&#xD;
enabling Brunswick to buy, in his own name,&#xD;
for his step-mother ten bundles of shingles,&#xD;
to repair her dwelling, that being considered&#xD;
by the worthy son as the best present which&#xD;
could be made -her. The destined day at&#xD;
last arrived, and whatever secret efforts the&#xD;
reluctant Brunswick wis making in opposition&#xD;
to the event seemed likely to fail. The bride&#xD;
was dressed in full splendor at twelve O'clock,&#xD;
and in the usual words of the female friends, '&#xD;
"never looked lovelier than at that moment,"&#xD;
the idea of full dress being thoroughly carried&#xD;
out in the wedding attire, though in some re-&#xD;
spects it might have been regarded by the crit-&#xD;
ical observer as the opposite of full. However,&#xD;
it made up in the skirt what it lacked in the&#xD;
bust, and as both were strictly en regle, it may&#xD;
be said she outstripped all the others present,&#xD;
metaphorically as well as literally. At two o'clock&#xD;
a large and fashionable assemblage, comprising&#xD;
some of the principal lady's maids, cooks, coach-&#xD;
men, and valets of the metropolis had gathered&#xD;
in and about the premises to assist at the cere-&#xD;
onies, it being deemed advisable that they-&#xD;
should take place thereat, to obviate any acci-&#xD;
dent which might occur to the guests were they&#xD;
compelled to rush along the public highways&#xD;
from the ceremony at the church to the dinner&#xD;
at the house.&#xD;
It now appeared that a few preliminary mat-&#xD;
ters, usually passed over, had to be settled in a&#xD;
minute manner in this case, ere the clergyman&#xD;
was willing to proceed. These were the requi-&#xD;
sites of the statutes made.and provided for such&#xD;
cases. The working of the poison which had&#xD;
been instilled into the pastor's mind for the past&#xD;
few days by Brunswick was perhaps disclosed in&#xD;
this sudden strictness, though the worthy cler-&#xD;
gyman had been a great stickler for particulars&#xD;
ever since he had been unfortunately arrested&#xD;
and threatened with incarceration in the peni-&#xD;
tentiary for a term of years as an accomplice of&#xD;
a severe case of bigamy in his flock. He pro-&#xD;
cbeded amid the hush of the guests to inquire&#xD;
the respective ages of the two parties about to&#xD;
be engaged in the solemn act. To this question&#xD;
there at once succeeded some confusion. Nei-&#xD;
ther knew how old they were, and the bride, who&#xD;
felt herself called upon to fully maintain the sen-&#xD;
sibility of her sex, declared with great feeling&#xD;
amid the applause of her feniale friends, that&#xD;
she would not tell if she could.&#xD;
"De ceremony can't go on!" exclaimed the&#xD;
clergyman briefly but decisively, and what with&#xD;
his own natural obstinacy and the ardent support&#xD;
he derived from Brunswick, the old gentleman's&#xD;
position might have conclusively stopped the&#xD;
proceedings had not several of the guests inter-&#xD;
fered. -By threatening to expel him from the&#xD;
pastorate if he would. not, and by promising to&#xD;
&#xD;
procure him bronchial leave of &amp;amp;bsence there-&#xD;
from if be would, he was finally persuaded to&#xD;
make a compromising survey and general aver-&#xD;
age and proceed to the next point, which was&#xD;
the principal one he was desirous of settling.'&#xD;
Upon the point of the one or both of them being&#xD;
at that time possibly contemplating polygamy,&#xD;
he flatly stated that he would not be content with&#xD;
the mere testimony of the parties themselves.&#xD;
"I an't gwine to get into de penitentiary for&#xD;
six years!i Tucker was a good member of Shi-&#xD;
loh, and I tought it all right! De ceremony&#xD;
can't go on!I"&#xD;
Beunswick gave , an audible expression of sat-&#xD;
isfaction at this, and his hopes rose high that&#xD;
there would be a postponement at least of the&#xD;
matter. But there happened to be in the assem-&#xD;
blage a young colored gentlemen, one of the sec-&#xD;
onds of the bridegroom, who occupied the most of&#xD;
his professional time in sweeping the floors and&#xD;
dusting the yellow calf of a legal firm of the city.&#xD;
This person promptly stepped forward, and fixing&#xD;
his gaze in adroit superciliousness upon the stick-&#xD;
ler for the statutes, stated that all which was re-&#xD;
quired to settle the case was hearsay.&#xD;
"In de case of Johnson vs. Bugg," said this&#xD;
young man, making a superhuman effort to re-&#xD;
member the forms so often used by his masters&#xD;
in the law office. "In de case of Johnson, 17th&#xD;
McCunn, it was held as elusivee by-by de alder-&#xD;
man after a long argument and able hearing, that&#xD;
as Missis Johnson's female friends had never&#xD;
found it out she didn't have eight husbands, and&#xD;
in Thomas vs. Thomas, see de Police Reports,&#xD;
470, it was 'termined dat as Thomas was 'cus-&#xD;
tomed to boast in de pothouses dat he had free&#xD;
other wives, it was sufficient grounds for grant-&#xD;
ing a divorce to the one who was then 'putedly&#xD;
supportin' of himI"&#xD;
"Wall I do' know but dat satisfies me. I tink&#xD;
it does. I must be satisfied on de law, dat is all.&#xD;
De ceremony can-hold, dere is one more pint,"&#xD;
continued the prudent divine. ,"I must proceed&#xD;
rationally. De lady in dis case'has been married&#xD;
afore ! What I wish to ask de bridegroom is,&#xD;
if he has felt coercion in dis matter ?"&#xD;
"Only once or twice, sir. It was highly na-&#xD;
chul I" replied the happy man.&#xD;
0 pshaw! I ask you, do you lub do Missis?"&#xD;
asked the minister in some irritation.&#xD;
"Pastor, I am willing, sir, to take -my oath&#xD;
on the holy writ !" replied the divinity-student.&#xD;
This was considered quite satisfactory, and&#xD;
with it the last hope of the discontented Bruns-&#xD;
wick vanished.&#xD;
The awful knot was now tied amidst a terrible&#xD;
silence, wherewith several pins in the assemblage&#xD;
sympathetically dropped.  This was immediate-&#xD;
ly followed by the tearful kissing of the bride.&#xD;
and the jocose congratulation of the happy&#xD;
groom, during which the former tore herself&#xD;
away to visit the banquet-room in her matron-&#xD;
ly desire that the festivities of the occasion&#xD;
should be successful in all the appointments,(&#xD;
and that none of the guests should unduly fore-I&#xD;
stall the others in partaking of the enjoyments(&#xD;
thereof; her mind, in fact, having been much&#xD;
distracted through the entire ceremony by the fact&#xD;
of two small children, acting under the instincts&#xD;
of extreme'youth, having taken advantage of the&#xD;
settlement of the preliminaries, and abstracted one&#xD;
of the mosct important pies and eight doughnuts&#xD;
&#xD;
from the nuptial board. The signing of the mar-&#xD;
riage certificate by the clergyman, which now took&#xD;
place, was an act of great solemnity, although the&#xD;
difficulties arising f om his limited experience&#xD;
in chirography were discernible in the spasmod-&#xD;
ic sympathy of his legs, eyes and tongue with his&#xD;
writing, the first being'thrust convuively back&#xD;
of his chair, the second starting from his head,&#xD;
and the latter protruded from his mouth and&#xD;
following the slow and arduous motions of his&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
At a given signal, a rush was made for the&#xD;
table, which was pronounced by one of the gen-&#xD;
tlemen present As "truly poetical." Extremely&#xD;
diverting were the trencher feats performed&#xD;
thereat, varying according to the constitutional&#xD;
ability or habits of the numerous guests. To&#xD;
speak generally, it would have been, perhaps, dan-&#xD;
gerous to have attempted to divert the attention of&#xD;
any from the intensely absorbing occupation,. un-&#xD;
til nature had been, at least, partially satisfied.&#xD;
The legal young gentleman and groomsman, who&#xD;
devoted himself to the oysters, seemed, also to&#xD;
delight in drinking vinegar in large quantities at&#xD;
a time, without winking, while a large colored&#xD;
gentleman opposite to him distinguished himself&#xD;
by the wonderful height to which he adroitly&#xD;
projected into the air, in parabolic curves, the food&#xD;
which ultimately reached his capacious mouth.&#xD;
The impressive ceremony, invented by another&#xD;
groomsman, in which the healths of the bride&#xD;
and her groom were drunken, is, perhaps, impos-&#xD;
sible to describe. A throb of enthusiasm, passed&#xD;
in each breast, as with arms intertwined, a lady&#xD;
and gentleman alternating, around the table, the&#xD;
entire company in solemn silence raised their&#xD;
glasses to their lips, and at a concerted moment,&#xD;
transferred the contents thereof to their interior.&#xD;
All of Brunswick's hope being completely dissi-&#xD;
pated when the magnanimous groom accosted&#xD;
him in an affecting, parental manner as "his&#xD;
son," he rationally proceeded to enjoy the occa-&#xD;
sion as much as possible, by eating, drinking&#xD;
kissing the bridesmaids, and assisting the gratifi-&#xD;
cati6n of the natural appetites of his powerless&#xD;
friend and consoler, the revered pastor. To such&#xD;
a degree was the clergyman's festive ardor in-&#xD;
creased by the step-son's efforts, that it exhibited&#xD;
itself before he finished, in a paralytic break-&#xD;
down in one corner of the room, and a spirited&#xD;
defiance to one or two gentlemen, who seemed&#xD;
inclined to look upon the performance as rather&#xD;
eccentric, and attempted to stop him therein.&#xD;
A ball in the evening consummated the event,&#xD;
when "the masculine youth, with irresistibly&#xD;
lovely women, comprising our most gifted jeunesse&#xD;
dorie, (we quote from a subsequent account in&#xD;
the Colored Statesman's Social Companion and&#xD;
Raw Oysterer,) were treading buoyantly the&#xD;
measures of foreign and domestic dances, the jig,&#xD;
saraband, and bolero, to the melody of softest&#xD;
strains, and where hovered over all a poesy of&#xD;
color, light, shade, odor, mirth, congeniality, and&#xD;
delight, as would have tempted an anchorite from&#xD;
hi5 cell and led a daughter of the mystic Church&#xD;
of Rome to forget her vows. It was a splendid&#xD;

iation.,&#xD;
"You have mentioned   refreshments, young&#xD;

"I have, and I say Windust's is the place."&#xD;
"I have already waived the consideration of&#xD;
your familiarity With my person, sir. As a friend&#xD;
of Mr. Winkfield, I consent to join you," contin-&#xD;
ued the judge, rising majestically, and taking Mo-&#xD;
sea's arm -at once. "It is a poor and wretched&#xD;
substitute for an apology, but I accept it."&#xD;
"He is somewhat vivacious, judge," said Moses&#xD;
as they followed Barnard, "and a little vehement&#xD;
in the manifestation of his friendship, but--"&#xD;
"Ie undoubtedly tried to knock me ofT the&#xD;
bench, sir."&#xD;
" But you will pass over his eccentricity ?"&#xD;
"I have, and as your friend, I humor his&#xD;
propositions, sir."&#xD;
" How did -the torch-light procession of the&#xD;
Club result, judge ?" asked Moses, as the three&#xD;
sat down together in the refreshment-room.&#xD;
.. " It was small, but brilliant, and would have&#xD;
been a success, sir-a success; but my constable&#xD;
accidentally sent a rocket into a third-story win-&#xD;
dow, which knocked over and set fire to a woman&#xD;
who was there. The procession was attacked and&#xD;
dispersed by the male relatives of the female,&#xD;
sir, and we couldn't get together again. Women&#xD;
again  said the judge, with severest irritation,&#xD;
in his melancholy," devil take'em all!" Affected&#xD;
by the remembrance, he drained his glass, and'&#xD;
proceeded with various incoherent observations'&#xD;
upon the deplorable state of his party, of muni-&#xD;
cipal affairs, of the nation, and of mankind gen-&#xD;
erally, and predictions of all sorts of calamities&#xD;
which were inevitable to all four, to which Moses&#xD;
feigned to listen with deep earne tneda, while Mr.&#xD;
Barnard appeared to be wholly taken up with de-&#xD;
lighted admiration of the ex-functionary's won-&#xD;
derful powers of section. He was in absolute&#xD;
ecstasy as the latter paused in his interesting re-&#xD;
cital, overcome by his feelings, and abstractedly&#xD;
drank from Moses's glass, which. had remained&#xD;
untouched upon the table.&#xD;
As Mr. Barnard ordered fresh glasses, and as&#xD;
the judge's conversation began to be interspersed&#xD;
with ferocious threats, and gave other signs of&#xD;
decided spirituous aberration, Moses concluded&#xD;
to rise and mention an engagement to be fulfilled&#xD;
by him up-town.&#xD;
"Some trouble with a young lady, his intend-&#xD;
ed, you know, and he is trying to patch it up,"&#xD;
whispered Barnard to the disappointed judge, as&#xD;
our hero determined to leave.&#xD;
There never was a truer saying than if there&#xD;
is any difficulty about, you'll find a woman in it "&#xD;
exclaimed the judge, bringing his fist down em-&#xD;
phatically upon the table. "Think of that noble&#xD;
young man being a victim of 'em  Sing'ler I&#xD;
Somehow, the best fellers fall a prey to 'em."&#xD;
"Never mind, excuse him ; but you stay and&#xD;
dine with me here, judge. We'll have one of&#xD;
Joseph's chops and a bottle of sherry," continued&#xD;
Mr. Barnard, who had become completely fasci,&#xD;
nated with the society of the fallen statesman.&#xD;
" You are a ImnoWing feller and 'telligent&#xD;
&#xD;
citizen. I will dine with you on your own ac-&#xD;
count and as rep'sent'ive of noble fren' and glo-&#xD;
rious fuller, Winkfield."&#xD;
It was hardly, however, as Moses's representa-&#xD;
tive that Mr. Barnard, later in the evening, en-&#xD;
deavored to lead the judge to the City Hall, for&#xD;
the purpose of attacking the building, with mis-&#xD;
siles, and of taking forcible possession of the&#xD;
Comptroller's office; nor as such when, by re-&#xD;
peated examples, he subsequently induced him&#xD;
to imitate the cries of various animals in the&#xD;
streets and lanes of the city. His careful escort&#xD;
of the judge to his lodgings was more in accord-&#xD;
ance with Moses's ideas of benevolence, and per-&#xD;
haps also were his vehement efforts to shove the&#xD;
ex-statesman through the back-kitchen window&#xD;
for the purpose of avoiding any unpleasant en-&#xD;
counter with the landlady, though he made a lit-&#xD;
tle too much unnecessary noise in the attempt.&#xD;
"1 thought you'd put your foot in it, coming&#xD;
in this way," said the judge, as the enraged fe-&#xD;
male appeared in the kitchen in her night ap-&#xD;
parel, armed with a broom and accompanied by a&#xD;
stout maid; "we'd better gone straighter front'&#xD;
door and rung."&#xD;
" What do you mean by coming home in&#xD;
spirits at midnight, and breaking into my house&#xD;
through the basement-window, like a villain and&#xD;
night prowelcr ? What do you mean ?" shrieked&#xD;
the lady, to relieve herself of the excitement of&#xD;
her fright.&#xD;
" Never mind, madam," interposed Mr. Bar-&#xD;
nard ; "every man has a right to break into any&#xD;
house which he owns or has properly paid the&#xD;
rent of."&#xD;
" But he hasn't paid the rent. Ie owes me&#xD;
for fifteen months out of two years and more he's&#xD;
been in this here house, a part of the time eating&#xD;
my string-beans, lamb, and green peas, and a&#xD;
bottle of horse-radish every time, which he is&#xD;
very fond of, and free use of my best wash-tub&#xD;
for bathing himself, the dissolute !"&#xD;
"There is no use arguing with her, she's got&#xD;
agoin'," said the semi-sobered judge in a low&#xD;
voice to his defender. "Berrer go I"&#xD;
" Drunk, and breaking in the back-winder, like&#xD;
g low attempt of a cunning night proweler I"&#xD;
"Theexactest traits of body or of mind&#xD;

murmured Mr. Barnard,&#xD;

"You, boon companion, leave my kitchen,&#xD;
with your 6issoluteness, you nasty, immoral de-&#xD;
bochy, or I'll make you with this," continued the&#xD;
excited female, shaking her broom at the tickled&#xD;
Barnard.&#xD;
" My dear madam," replied he, " these are cer-&#xD;
tainly very sweeping remarks of yours?.&#xD;
"You think you'll continue your orgey here?&#xD;
Go off I"&#xD;
" As you go on so, I shall be compelled to, my&#xD;

remaining here to converse, but really there is&#xD;
fascination about your appearance and conversa-&#xD;
tion which it was impossible to resist."&#xD;
"She's a flirt," interrupted the judge in thick&#xD;
accents; " a dre'ful flirt I"&#xD;
" What do you mean by that, you fool" asked&#xD;
the outraged female,&#xD;

CHAPTER    LXXII.t&#xD;
TUE CONCLUSION.              -&#xD;
Ta sensitive grandmother of Miss Wagbull,&#xD;
had no doubt seen during her long earthly ex-I&#xD;
perience many-events ocdurring over which she&#xD;
had no control, and it is probable that her in-&#xD;
telligence at last overcame her feelings of anti-&#xD;
pathy to the entertainment by her granddaughter(&#xD;
of any idea of marriage, and led her to acquiesce(&#xD;
in a matter which she could not countervail. She&#xD;
at once transferred those feelings to the delin-I&#xD;
quencies of the Irish boy, and made the late ob-I&#xD;
ject of her opposition her confident in the mat-&#xD;
ter, seizing constant opportunities of revealing&#xD;
to him the shortcomings which she had sudden-&#xD;
ly observed in the unhappy page's conduct, and&#xD;
asking for advice upon his supposed refractori-&#xD;
ness. Moses defended the youth as well as hisI&#xD;
benevolence could prompt him, but for a few&#xD;
days that worthy domestic's existence appeared&#xD;
to be under a cloud.&#xD;
The conduct of Mr. Wagbull had now become&#xD;
very mysterious. He Yppeared to be engrossed&#xD;
with a matter of great importance, which it was&#xD;
in vain for his friends to discover, excepting Mr.&#xD;
Titman, for whom his friendship seemed sud-&#xD;
denly to have become intense and confidential to&#xD;
an unaccountable degree. The tw5 were seen&#xD;
together from morn till eve, rushing in and out&#xD;
of the mansion at unexpected hours, engaging in&#xD;
low, earnest consultation, or poring over books&#xD;
and writings therein, and then disappearing to&#xD;
some unknown quarter with the same haste they&#xD;
had displayed in their advent. Mr. Titman man-&#xD;
ifested a dignified reserve in answer to the in-&#xD;
quiry of his friends on the singularity of these&#xD;
proceedings, alluding but abstractedly to his en-&#xD;
grossment in difficult problems connected with&#xD;
the science to 'which he was devoted, and softtes,,&#xD;
stringers, intrados, arches, and Knoblesdorff&#xD;
seemed mixed in inextricable confusion in his&#xD;
thoughts. TIhe day before that fixed for Miss&#xD;
Wagbull's union with Moses a solution to the&#xD;
mystery was promulgated in the form of a gor-&#xD;
geously engraved invitation, issued to the nu,&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
merous friends of both, requesting their assist-&#xD;
nce at a dinner in a small but elegant house,&#xD;
which the worthy parent had bought up town, and&#xD;
ad been altering and repairing with studied care&#xD;
and secrecy to zuit the peculiar tastes of his&#xD;
daughter and her husband. Without the know-&#xD;
edge of either, all the necessary arrangements,&#xD;
had been completed therein, even to the employ-&#xD;
ment of a distinguished cook, who had been pro-&#xD;
cured for the establishment by Dehnonico,, and&#xD;
who had been for days previous quietly study-&#xD;
ng to render his introductory dinner worthy of&#xD;
his reputation. Brunswick had been installed as&#xD;
butler of the establishment, and Miss-WagbulPs&#xD;
maid sought secret opportunities to visit the new&#xD;
mansion and prepare for her coming duties as&#xD;
housekeeper.&#xD;
On the morning of the marriage-day nothing&#xD;
occurred to mar the harmony of the prepara-&#xD;
tions for the ceremony, excepting perhaps pre-&#xD;
mature symptoms of intoxication upon the part&#xD;
of the. Irish boy, and the detection at an early&#xD;
stage of the worthy parent of the bride in the&#xD;
act of laughing at the trouble of Miss Rushton,&#xD;
as one of the bridesmaids, and his prompt ex-&#xD;
pulsion from further participation in the prepar-&#xD;
tory proceedings. The entire party repaired to-&#xD;
St. Catherine's church, where the revered pas-&#xD;
tor of the family, Dr. Tinker, united the two,&#xD;
Miss Rushton and one of the fashionable Miss&#xD;
Browns sustaining the bride in this hour of trial,&#xD;
and Mr. Barnard and Mr. Titman performing a&#xD;
similar part for our hero. The old lady-was&#xD;
with difficulty prevented from indulging in her&#xD;
desire to sit in the gallery that she might more&#xD;
oomprehensively view the scene of the ceremo-&#xD;
ny, and the washerwoman of Mr. Wagbull's es-&#xD;
tablishment, with whom the bride was a great&#xD;
favorite, was led out of the church in tears by&#xD;
Brunswick and the coachman ere the ceremony&#xD;
was finished.&#xD;
To be tremblingly alive to gentle impressions&#xD;
and yet to be able to preserve, when the prose-&#xD;
cution of a design requires it, an immovable&#xD;
heart amidst even the most imperious causes of&#xD;
soul-subduing emotion, is perhaps not an impossi-&#xD;
ble constitution of mind; but it is the utmost&#xD;
and rarest endowment of humanity. Miss Stacy&#xD;
saw the ceremony froin the neighborhood of the&#xD;
organ, and retired from the edifice with the de-&#xD;
termination to immediately pursue the .Cuban&#xD;
gentleman with unrelenting vigor.&#xD;
In the evening a merry party sat down to the&#xD;
wedding-dinner in the new house. The great&#xD;
cook bad surveyed the tasteful arrangements of&#xD;
the table from a distance, and, deeply affected,&#xD;
had pronounced it satisfactory, and authorized&#xD;
the introduction of the guests. It is difficult to&#xD;
say who was the life of the occasion, as every&#xD;
one seemed inspired with the idea that he or she&#xD;
.was, and endeavored to sustain the reputation by&#xD;
their best efforts. Mr. Toplady was unusually&#xD;
brilliant. Ile had learned in the parlor, as the&#xD;
bride surveyed her presents, from the whispering&#xD;
lips of the gratified Bessie herself, who had re-&#xD;
served the important information as the best re-&#xD;
turn she could make to her uncle, that "Miss De&#xD;
Pompenkops was on her return from Europe."&#xD;
In the words of the illustrious Jenkins we may&#xD;
say that the occasion generally sparkled with the&#xD;
wit and intelligence of the ilite of the intellectual&#xD;
cand social circles of the metropolis, History was&#xD;
&#xD;
represented by the joyful presence of Mr. Lamp-,&#xD;
son of Westchester, with his lady, the latter hav-&#xD;
ing added to the numerous bridal presents, as&#xD;
their testimonial of friendship, a copy of her hus-&#xD;
band's recently published and valuable work on&#xD;
Simkinson, splendidly bound in Bagsterian style.&#xD;
Great were the hopes which that lady expressed&#xD;
at the final dabet of this great effort of her hus-&#xD;
band's historical genius. The labors and anxiety&#xD;
of its preparation were now over. The fears of&#xD;
its proof-sheets being stolen during the progress&#xD;
of its printing by the wretched Numhead and&#xD;
other envious creatures were past. Immense&#xD;
excitement was already noticeable in the histori-&#xD;
cal world, and three copies had already been dis-&#xD;
posed of. The faithful wife thoroughly captivated&#xD;
the affections of Bessie's grandparent, and made&#xD;
indefinite promises in reply to the latter's persist-&#xD;
ent demands that she should thenceforth spend&#xD;
a week at the Wagbull mansion every fortnight,'&#xD;
accompanied by her little boys. Dr. Tinker came&#xD;
out during the dinner in learned force upon vari-&#xD;
ous metaphysical subjects, all his professional de-'&#xD;
sires to mingle a little instruction with the amuse-&#xD;
ment being warmed by the occasion. Mr. Wag-&#xD;
bull made an extremely appropriate and affecting&#xD;
speech in reply to the general toast to his health,&#xD;
in which he endeavored to show that he had not&#xD;
given away a daughter, but had been favored by&#xD;
Providence with a noble young gentleman for a&#xD;
son ; a view of the matter, which the old lady&#xD;
seemed still somewhat doubtful about and dis-&#xD;
posed to refute by momentarily returning to first&#xD;
principles in her conduct toward our hero. In&#xD;
conclusion, Mr. Wagbull proposed the health of&#xD;
his old friend and pastor, Dr. Tinker, and alluded&#xD;
to the latter's high intellectual qualities and ex-&#xD;
treme virtues so eloquently, that the object of his&#xD;
encomium cried " Hear ! hear!" in forgetful enthu-&#xD;
siasm, and then replied in a manner which affect-&#xD;
ed all present-the more interested by the depth&#xD;
of'his remarks, the less so, by their length. And&#xD;
then there were toasts to every one present, and&#xD;
to the bride and bridegroom once more, at the&#xD;
conclusion of which, Dr. Tinker, Mr. Toplady,&#xD;
Mr. Titman, and other gentlemen present, at the&#xD;
instigation and signal of Mr. Barnard, gave three&#xD;
astonishing cheers in their honor. The domestics&#xD;
of Mr. Wagbull's establishment, and of the new&#xD;
one, together with a special deputation feom the&#xD;
colored church of Shiloh, comprising the principal&#xD;
members of its committee on music, were intro-&#xD;
duced by Brunswick from the precincts below.&#xD;
An epithalamium improvised by the head darkey&#xD;
of the committee,swho was also an assistant in&#xD;
the kitchen, was then sung by the tuneful band,&#xD;
and with many wishes of future happiness to the&#xD;
new couple, the party again retired below, to be&#xD;
substantially rewarded, and to enjoy the evening&#xD;
after their own fashion. Toward the hour of&#xD;
eleven, the musical committee, leaving the man-&#xD;
sion by the area-gate, gave six terrific cheers in&#xD;
the back-yard, startling several of the neighbors&#xD;
into the belief that a prominent politician had&#xD;
moved into the neighborhood. They then retired&#xD;
quietly to their respective homes. About the&#xD;
same period, the more staid of the guests above,&#xD;
had concluded that the hour for departure had&#xD;
arrived, especially as Mr. Lampson, the historical&#xD;
genius, had disappeared beneath the table, and&#xD;
Mr. Toplady and two country relatives of Mr.&#xD;
Winikfield had fallen fast asleep. Without car-,&#xD;
&#xD;
rying into effect the somewhat-eccentric proposi-&#xD;
tion of Mr. Barnard to the other gentlemen, that&#xD;
they should retire to the billiard-room, extinguish&#xD;
the lights, and try the efficacy of an unrestrained&#xD;
personal combat to dissipate the effects of the&#xD;
wine, the whole party retired from the newly-&#xD;
founded home, leaving the happy bride and bride-&#xD;
groom, with tears and embraces by the relatives,&#xD;
and renewed wishes of perpetual joy and content-&#xD;
ment from the others. Mr. Wagbull conducted&#xD;
to his home for the night such guests as lived at&#xD;
a distance or felt so, including the illustrious his-&#xD;
torical scholar and his wife, the society of Mr.&#xD;
Lampson having become especially interesting to&#xD;
him from the secret political information with&#xD;
which he had been intrusted in convivial mo-&#xD;
ments by that gentleman, to the effect that so im-&#xD;
portant had become his official relations and per-&#xD;
sonal friendship with the collector of the port,&#xD;
that the great functionary had made him a prom-&#xD;
ise to resign in his favor.&#xD;
We wish, indeed, that the filial misgivings of&#xD;
Brunswick upon the marriage of his step-mother&#xD;
with the divinity-student might have been invali-&#xD;
dated by the result. But it was not so.  The&#xD;
couple had been united scarcely six months, when&#xD;
the. faithless swain, possessing himself of his&#xD;
wife's small change and various portable articles&#xD;
of the household, including the parlor-copy of&#xD;
the Bible and Byron, eloped with a young sister&#xD;
of Shiloh, whose tender, inexperienced years ren-&#xD;
dered his dastardly conduct still more reprehen-&#xD;
sible. As the principal part of his wife's con-&#xD;
vertible funds had been, with perhaps prophetic&#xD;
judgment, concealed beneath the nest of a cer-&#xD;
tain perpetually-setting old hen, whose pugna.&#xD;
cious disposition and chronic barrenness led him&#xD;
to avoid the spot in his oval depredations, he for-&#xD;
tunately was unable wholly to tiespoil the desert-&#xD;
ed woman. He left a delicately-scented note, in&#xD;
heroic verse, in which he feelingly alluded, after&#xD;
the approved style of poets in similar difficulties,&#xD;
to certairgdestinies which compelled his perma-&#xD;
nent withdrawal from her society, and endeavored&#xD;
to explain the embezzlement of her property, by&#xD;
delicately insinuating that it was done for the&#xD;
hum aA  and Christian purpose of chastening a&#xD;
slight ropensity to avarice which he had ob-&#xD;
served in her. Several friends of the bereaved&#xD;
woman kindly consented to come and sit with'&#xD;
her, and to console her in her deep affliction,&#xD;
particularly at meals, and at other moments&#xD;
when his absence would most likely be felt by&#xD;
her. Such was the pertinacity of their friend-&#xD;
ship, that although she at last felt forced todrive-&#xD;
them from her house, with the observation that&#xD;
she needed their consolation as little as she did&#xD;
their company, it only seemed to increase their&#xD;
Christian efforts, and they came back in greater&#xD;
-force than ever.&#xD;
The political downfall of Judge Pootoops was&#xD;
complete. He was never able to recover the&#xD;
high standing in the ranks of the party of his&#xD;
ward, of which his bolting had deprived him.&#xD;
His former adherents were the very first to sum-&#xD;
mariLy eject him from its meetings the moment&#xD;
he mnade his appearance at the door thereof.&#xD;
Thcre was one, however, who still stuck by him&#xD;
in adversity, and wvho dared, on such occasions,&#xD;
those ungrateful time-servers to mortal combat-&#xD;
his faithful admirer and former constable, Tim-&#xD;
kins. Observing that it was useless to try for&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7256-00000081"/>&#xD;
MR. WINKFIELD.&#xD;
&#xD;
office again, the latter energetically established a&#xD;
feed-store, of which the kindling-wood depart-&#xD;
ment was intrusted to the ex-judge. Timkins&#xD;
found some difficulty in accustoming the lofty&#xD;
spirit of the statesman to his new duties, and&#xD;
frequently was obliged to tie him to the scene of&#xD;
his labors. His mind would still turn back with&#xD;
irrepressible force to his old political contests.&#xD;
Imaginary scenes of political activity, drawn&#xD;
from the composite elements of his experience,&#xD;
occupied his retirement. Numerous plots and&#xD;
masterly schemes of diplomatic subterfuge were&#xD;
invented by him in the leisure of his arm-chair in&#xD;
the wood-shed. Indeed, parties were formed,&#xD;
dissolved, and  reconstructed, administrations&#xD;
overthrown, policies changed, and the foundations&#xD;
of state even shaken to their centre, by the fer-&#xD;
tile imagination of this inveterate lover of poli-&#xD;
tics, and it is quite possible that the hope of some&#xD;
grand movement to call him from his retirement,&#xD;
and put his schemes into practice, either in the&#xD;
municipal or national part of the government,&#xD;
never left his bosom. Until that moment should&#xD;
arrive, he was content to be his own party, and&#xD;
tb issuemanifestoes, promulgate orders and make&#xD;
speeches to himself, and to appoint himself on&#xD;
the various committees which the minute of his&#xD;
plans suggested as necessary. Frequently, how-&#xD;
ever, in the oratorical part of his proceedings,&#xD;
he obtained the presence of-four boys and three&#xD;
little girls, from their sports in the neighborhood,&#xD;
and, on these occasions, they might be observed,&#xD;
in solemn silence and awe, arranged in order&#xD;
upon a bench in the wood-shed, with their* legs&#xD;
dangling therefrom, while the energetic Cato pro-&#xD;
ceeded in front of them to hurl defiance at the&#xD;
leaders of the opposition, or call down the anathe-&#xD;
mas of heaven upon the pernicious practices of&#xD;
the factionists of his own party.&#xD;
Shortly after his union with Miss Wagbull,&#xD;
Moses was returning through Brooklyn with Mr.&#xD;
Titman from a professional examination, by the&#xD;
latter, of the Greenwood gate, when he became&#xD;
the accidental witness of a surprising but ex-&#xD;
tremely interesting sight, as they drove through&#xD;
the street in which that respectable but weak&#xD;
member of society, Mr. Tomlins, resided.  The&#xD;
door of the Tomlins mansion was open, and mov-&#xD;
ing therefrom toward the corner of the street&#xD;
was a crowd of men and boys following, in an&#xD;
evident state of extreme ecstasy and delight,&#xD;
the desired father-in-law of Mr. Bunter, who was&#xD;
intently engaged in kicking the Rev. Mr. Hunkey-&#xD;
fell along the pavement, upon which that pious&#xD;
.gentleman was endeavoring to make as rapid&#xD;
progress as possible. At every application of Mr.&#xD;
Tomlins's foot loud were the outcries of delight&#xD;
by the increasing crowd, .but such was the in--&#xD;
tensity of his feelings, and so thoroughly absorbed&#xD;
was he in the accomplishment of his work, that&#xD;
they were entirely unnoticed by him, and it was not&#xD;
until he was physically exhausted that he ceased&#xD;
and walked back in semi-appeased excitement to&#xD;
the house,  T~he presumption founded upon this&#xD;
&#xD;
scene by Moses was the eminently satisfactory&#xD;
one, that - at last the unprincipled hypocrite's&#xD;
machinations were discovered and visited with&#xD;
condign vengeance by his finally awakened victim.&#xD;
Moses felt an almost irresistible desire to inquire&#xD;
how this had been brought about, but he con-&#xD;
cluded it would be advisable, from the inflamed&#xD;
countenance of the aroused Mr. Tomlins, and&#xD;
from Mr. Titman's ignorance of his own connec-&#xD;
tion with the matter, to postpone its gratifica-&#xD;
tion. He soon afterward, -however, received a&#xD;
note from the worthy Mr. Tomlins, in which the&#xD;
latter, after frankly thanking our hero for his&#xD;
endeavors to expose the wiles of the hypocrite&#xD;
to him, and expressing his penitence for the ill&#xD;
manner in which he had appreciated those en-&#xD;
deavors, stated that he himself had at last dis-&#xD;
covered the impious rascality and true objects&#xD;
of his favorite, and felt that he could not re-&#xD;
cover his self-respect until he had visited the&#xD;
latter with personal indignity, which he had&#xD;
taken occasion to administer on the last visit of&#xD;
the unsuspecting rascal at his house; that he&#xD;
had, in partial atonement for his own prejudiced&#xD;
conduct and in justice to his daughter and the&#xD;
excellent young man to whom she was at-&#xD;
tached, consented to a quiet and private mar-&#xD;
riage, and that they were already upon their&#xD;
wedding-tour; that they had entreated him, ere&#xD;
they went, to write to Mr. Winkfield informing&#xD;
him of the nature of these events and their hap-&#xD;
py issue, and that upon their return, which they&#xD;
would promptly acquaint him with, they hoped&#xD;
to renew the friendship which would never have&#xD;
been interrupted but from the unscrupulous cun-&#xD;
ning of the rascal aforesaid.&#xD;
'Moses, a year or two subsequently, learned&#xD;
through his friend Mr. Bunter, that the reverend&#xD;
gentleman had induced an old lady of weak mind&#xD;
to send him as missionary to Africa, and that,&#xD;
after a short stay in the field of his proposed&#xD;
labors, he had for some private reason absconded&#xD;
into the interior, where he was. frequently heard&#xD;
of by ships trading upon the coast, as having&#xD;
become the head prince of A great tribe, and as&#xD;
doing a heavy business in ivory, slaves, and jaun-&#xD;
dice resulting from sixty-three attacks of the&#xD;
jungle-fever. The governor of his palace, Prince&#xD;
Lommiderio, at one period undertook to revolt,&#xD;
seizing an occasion when the chief was supposed&#xD;
to have been hunting ground-nuts with his retinue&#xD;
in one of his remote provinces. The wily chief,&#xD;
who had purposely secreted himself in his ele-&#xD;
phant pasture, suddenly returned, extracted the&#xD;
front-teeth of the rebel with his fist, and order-&#xD;
ing a wild, untamed ostrich to be brought forth,&#xD;
tied the criminal upon its back,-and set fire to&#xD;
the bird's tail. The unhappy Lommiderio may&#xD;
have perished in, the desert, but it is more prob-&#xD;
able that he was pecked to death by the frenzied&#xD;
bird in its wild endeavors to extinguish the con-&#xD;
flagration.&#xD;
We now bid our readers farewell.&#xD;
