I like, too, that representation they [the old Norsemen] have of the tree Igdrasyl.&#xD;
All life is figured by them as a tree. Igdrasyl, the Ash-tree of existence, has its roots&#xD;
deep down in the kingdoms of Ilela or Death; its trunk reaches up heaven-high,&#xD;
spreads its boughs over tbe whole universe: it is the tree of Existence. Is not every&#xD;
leaf of it a biography every fibre there an act or word ? - CMtLYLE.&#xD;

No, not that Album, loaded with gilt like aii~1a~tern slave,&#xD;
even though it be "precisely like the otie on i4ady Blessing-&#xD;
ton's table," as the giver, 1~I~r. H-, assures ~ne; but this&#xD;
eN      one, in plain black, with onlphe design of the serpent and the&#xD;
dove upon the back. It is "plain and substantial," as uld&#xD;
Mrs. A-. was pleased to say of myself; and when Harold&#xD;
T- gave it me, pointing to the design, he bade me heed&#xD;
the symbol well, saying, in that calm, grave way of his, that&#xD;
I lacked both wisdom and gentleness. "Mi master," I should&#xD;
hardly have borne tk~t from any one else. ~B4 perhaps he&#xD;
was right - right, also, when he said that a "wciman &amp;amp;~nnot&#xD;
*        exist without a confidant."  I denied it then, and resented it&#xD;
as a libel; but, now, after a four weeks' sojot~rn with these&#xD;
*         relatives, with whom it seems impossible to establish any-&#xD;
thing like relations of confidence, I begin to feel its truth,&#xD;
else I should not be blotting the blank leaves of his gift.&#xD;
N. 13. I will never own as much to him!&#xD;
4          I think I will dedicate the book to Vacuna, the goddess&#xD;
of the idle ~ doubtless many of my self-constit~ed advisers&#xD;
would think it very apprdpriate. Not that II admit that U&#xD;
have any more of an inherent proclivity to what, in their&#xD;
constitutes the "sum of all moral eVil ".-.-- idleness - than&#xD;
many others; but I am, unfortunately, always doing those&#xD;
things which I ought not to do, and in a way in wh~eh they&#xD;
ought not to be done; and, as Aunt1Mirick said, when I saw&#xD;

small parcel, containing a few yards of silk, "there is no&#xD;
'hope for me!&#xD;
I know I am neither pretty nor graceful, but I never have&#xD;
such a saving consciousness of the' fact, as when with my&#xD;
mother's relatives. I wonder how much such remarks, ut-&#xD;
tered in a~t~ne of cold, critical commiseration, as, "Elizabeth&#xD;
is so overgrown, so ~wky Elizabeth is so odd; she has no&#xD;
taste in dress; h~&amp;amp; head is so large ;~'aud then, her feet ! - she&#xD;
has not the Sewal look at all, poor child; all Lytton!" etc.&#xD;
(my rather's alliancee being the one ~" blot in the esTciitcheon "),&#xD;
have had to do with my awkwardness? They are not partic-&#xD;
ularly calculated to remedy the defect, I fancy.&#xD;
Once I felt all this keenly, but I am getting bravely over&#xD;
it. My head and my feet are as God made them; as for&#xD;
taste in dress, let them remember that I have had no means&#xD;
of gratifying it, before they deny me its possession; and, as&#xD;
to lacking the "~Sewal air," the slightest childish memory&#xD;
that I cherish of my noble father is more to me than "the&#xD;
blood of all the $~wals!"&#xD;
There! There goes the dinner-bell! My fingers are inky,&#xD;
~my collar the sixteenth part of an inch awry; if I do not&#xD;
stay to right ib aunt will be 'sure to perceive it; if I do, I&#xD;
8hall be the sixteenth part of a minute too late at the table,&#xD;
and~ uncle will look like an iceberg - between them both the&#xD;
room will be like Spitzbergen. Elizabeth will be uneasy and&#xD;
distraite for a few moments, then eat her dinner with the&#xD;

Nov. 10th. "A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in&#xD;
pictures of silver," we are told; but who has not felt that a&#xD;
word fitly withheld is not less precious?&#xD;
Had I remembered 'this yesterday, IL should have refrained&#xD;
from shocking uncle and aunt with my heresies, and saved&#xD;
myself a long lecture on "womanly proprieties," and "wo"&#xD;
man's sphere," this' niorning~&#xD;
Though some moments too late, I was happily disappointed&#xD;

THE DIARY.&#xD;
on entering the dining-room, for uncle was too busily occupied&#xD;
iu~ talking with an old gentleman to notice my tardiiiess,&#xD;
though the exquisite French time-piece on the'mabtel stared&#xD;
him straight in the face. Mr. II-, aunt's nephew, ba4&#xD;
dropped in to dinner.&#xD;
Query.- What brings him here so often of i~te? An tin-&#xD;
creasing appreciation o%~his aunt's cz&amp;amp;i~ini&amp;amp;e, or the laudable&#xD;
desire to keep himself in practice, by pI&amp;amp;~ing oW his Euro-&#xD;
pean fascinations on a country teacher? ~&#xD;
He certainly is han~Isome; and,, as aunt and, he sat there,&#xD;
both so carefully dressed, so seemingly oblivious ~of the fact&#xD;
that rents and dust, lint' and wrinkles, missing buttons and ~,'&#xD;
hooks-and-eyes, are' a part' of the evils consequent upon "Ad-.&#xD;
am's fall," it would have been an inexpressible relief to me&#xD;
to have seen a speck o~ dust on either of them ; - ay; to&#xD;
have proved their affinity for "dust and ashes," like other&#xD;
mortals, I would have been willing to encounter ,a slight si..&#xD;
rocco, or that cloud which Christian saw at the house of the&#xD;
Interpreter, even at~A~he expense of my new marron merino,&#xD;
in which IL fancied I was looking remarkably .well.&#xD;
H.- greeted me with his bh~ndest smile, and uncle intro..&#xD;
duced "my niece" to his guest, the Rev. Dr~ Smith. TJpi~,t~s&#xD;
manner of introducing me as "n~y niece,~' - a title which lie&#xD;
evidently considers sufliciently~' distinctive for any reasonable&#xD;
young lady4 - causes some mistakes; for his guests inva-&#xD;
riably address me as Miss Sewal. This old gentleman 4id&#xD;
the same, and' when I set him right, he said:&#xD;
"Ah! ay, yes; the daughter of your sister ~lizabeth, Nr.&#xD;
Sewal. L remember your mother, my child, when she was&#xD;
scarce as old as yourself. She married, let me see - a -~"&#xD;
"4u editor," II said.&#xD;
"Ah, yes, IL think IL met him once or twice during the&#xD;
sitting of the 4~sociation 'in this city, some - well some&#xD;
twenty-five r~ar.4~ ago. How time does fly ~ He~ is well, I&#xD;
hope."&#xD;

&#xD;
"I trust so," I said, my eyes filling with tears. But'&#xD;
before I could gather courage to go on uncle had answered&#xD;
for me:&#xD;
." Mr. Lytton is dead,&#xD;
"Indeed!" sM4 the old man, in a tone of concern.&#xD;
"i'ardon me, n~y dear young lady, I might have heard it,&#xD;
but we old folks forget1.' But your mother, - is she still in&#xD;
the city?"&#xD;
"No, sir," said I calmly, for uncle's cold tones had&#xD;
recalled me to myself; "my father's health failed soon after&#xD;
his marriage, 'and my mother accompanied him to his native&#xD;
village, where he died when I was five years old. Mother&#xD;
and I have continued to live at the old place, with the excep-&#xD;
tion of a short residence at G-' two years' ago."&#xD;
"And it seems but a few months~ since your mother was&#xD;
here, a girl," said the old man, looking kindly at me. "But&#xD;
you a~e not like her, child, unless it be about the mouth."&#xD;
"My niece is all Lytton, as I tell her," said my uncle, as&#xD;
we seated ourselves at the ~table.&#xD;
So this old man had known my~ neither before trials, and&#xD;
po'~erty, ~nd sorrow, had changed her, and I determined to&#xD;
ni~ke him my friend, if' possible) and see if I. could not get&#xD;
from him some better conc~~tion of what she was like in her&#xD;
youth, than I had obtained from her own family, - some-&#xD;
thing beside descriptions of her beauty, coupled~with ill-&#xD;
co~icealed regrets that she should have "thrown herself&#xD;
away" tipon a poor editor, who was "only a farmer's son."&#xD;
I am sorry to say that I was more occupied with these&#xD;
thoughts than with 'the doctor's "grace," Which was scarcely&#xD;
ended, when aunt, reaching forward to adjust th~ fall of my&#xD;
bertke, whispered:&#xD;
"That dress of yours is far too large, dear; it wrinkles&#xD;
quite badly under the arm; and your braids on the left&#xD;
side are slipping down~ Order is 'Heavei~s ~rst law, you&#xD;
know."&#xD;
&#xD;
Dear Vacuna, I had i~et aunt's chambermaid'~ little tod-&#xD;
dling nephew in the passage, as I came down, and, oblh4~Is~&#xD;
of hair-pins and braids, had stoppQd to toss hiin4~ up to t~he&#xD;
moon." But I did not tell aunt this, - I had~ too much regard~&#xD;
for myself and "bubby Lee,"- I merely s ~ ~s I*olly ~4&#xD;
my chicken:                                     §&#xD;
"Just so, aunt; but, as we happen to be'still on earth, I&#xD;
hold it to be wiser to comply with earth's laws; perhaps, in&#xD;
this way, we shall, in tinie,~eome to understand and fulfil&#xD;
those of a higher sphere." I&#xD;
Aunt looked a little confused, as I have noticed she not&#xD;
infrequently does, at my remarks; and the old doctor, inter-&#xD;
rupting himself in some remark, asked:&#xD;
"What was that you were saying about a higher sphere?-&#xD;
a favorite phrase with th&amp;amp; young people of the present day,&#xD;
Mr. Sewal."&#xD;
"I was merely sayin~ that whatever may be the. laws of a.&#xD;
higher sphere, full play for the lungs is very essential here."&#xD;
H- laughed, and the old man, after a bland, Vety&#xD;
true; I am glad you understand something of the wonderful&#xD;
mechanism of the human frame," turned to dissecting Dr.&#xD;
Bushnell and his heresies, and, assisted by i.rncle and aun.4,&#xD;
succeeded pretty thoroughly. I v~tu.red, once or twice~ t~ ~&#xD;
put in a sort of disclaimer, in tli~~hape of a question, and&#xD;
11-.-- gallantly seconded me; but we were calmly put down&#xD;
by a gentle hint that the carnal mind could not judge upon&#xD;
such matters; and I sat and wonde~4 if the Ii' ~ mind&#xD;
had~really so changed since the poor and ignorant ,- he pub-&#xD;
lican and sinner, had gladly accepted the truth, as it fell&#xD;

Th~g they went into the condition. ~ th~world ~n ~erieral,&#xD;

man had fervently thanked God for all the "manifold bless~&#xD;
ings which ~of his own good will and pleasure he had showered&#xD;
upon us; but, most of allAhat he had given us our being in&#xD;
this land of GQspel light and Gospel privileges." It is&#xD;
strange ~wi~h acceptance I find in the world, and how&#xD;
Iittl~ intelligent belief. These people were sincere, and&#xD;
would have thought one mad who questioned their ortho-&#xD;
doxy; yet, if I took them at their word, they were practical&#xD;
atheists,: denying the power. ~f truth to regenerate the&#xD;
world.&#xD;
Uncle is a born conservative, "dyed in the wool," with a&#xD;
perfect horror of all restless, vulgar innovators, who threaten&#xD;
to disturb anything, from the tie of his white cravat to the&#xD;
foundations of a state. lie wonld ignore time huinself, if&#xD;
possible. But with Dr. Smith it is different. One can&#xD;
readily perceive how his conservatism is but the natural&#xD;
growth of that innate principle whiq~is developed by years&#xD;
and success in life, aided not a lit~Te by an unquestioning&#xD;
adhere~ee to' certain theological notions; which haire, spider~&#xD;
like, spuu their web so completely over his heart, that he has&#xD;
almost forgotten the warm, gushing, sympathetic throbs of&#xD;
its, youth, or remembers them only with a pitying smile, as&#xD;
you.thfal enthusiasm. Enthusiasm! Would that we could&#xD;
"be true to the dreams of our youth!" Would that we&#xD;
could take them with us, a~ blessed realities, down the ~shady&#xD;
slopes of life! Then old age would not be so meagre and&#xD;
barren.&#xD;
So I x~ised, until the exclamation, "It is astonishing!"&#xD;
which usually forms-the affix and suffix to all uncle's remarks&#xD;
on religion and morals, roused me. "It is really astonishing&#xD;
how sensible people, Christian people, can be so blind. I do&#xD;
not blame the south. Were they to come here, sir, and make,&#xD;
such demands on us, we should see the Impropriety, ,the&#xD;
absurdity, at once. But that ~uch tuen *.~ Messrs. C-&#xD;

"All the result, of narrow,. sectional vi~ws~ai~&amp;amp; a restless&#xD;
desire to forestall- the workings of Providence," blan4ly-&#xD;
answered the old doctor.&#xD;
They had - aetnally begun "to agitate," those4 two staid&#xD;
pillars of conservatism, and F opened my ~ ~fo~ I knew&#xD;
that among my many unknown heresies which l~a'd thought&#xD;
best tQ leave to the unfolding hand of time, my abolition &amp;amp;&#xD;
ism," in their eyes, would be the rankest. I thought of~ the -&#xD;
days in G-, when, from ev~y lesson and ove~y object;&#xD;
"my master" (IL like the old, sportive title besV) was wont 1~i.&#xD;
deduce argument~ in favor of liberty and progress; oi~d'how,&#xD;
in the spirit of opposition, I sought every argum~n1~ on the&#xD;
opposite side, until obliged to yield. Those were lint battles!&#xD;
He would never yield an inch to the sex, - never condescend&#xD;
to say I might possibly be '-right; but, on the other hand, he&#xD;
treated~ me as an equal, capable of thinking for myself, not&#xD;
as a pet or puppet. X. d not fully appreciate this, then;&#xD;
but now, ay, I see it is necessary to get at a distance from.&#xD;
some people, as well as pictures, to see them trt~l~y. ~&#xD;
der, if we were to meet again, if we should resume the war;&#xD;
I wonder - but enough of this. What II would say is this,&#xD;
that T-'s lessons had fully qualified me to understand th0 --&#xD;
subject, and I asked inquiringly, and, I must confess, rtWer~&#xD;

truth? Thus I thought, but I did not say it; only sug-&#xD;
gested that he might possibly misunderstand these men.&#xD;
Moreover, they were but a small portion of the supporters&#xD;
of the anti-slavery cause.&#xD;
Uncle gave me a look that seemed to say that women were&#xD;
to be seen, not heard, and took up the conversation just&#xD;
where itihad stood before my interference.&#xD;
"Quite right, doctor; but something must be done t~ put&#xD;
down these elements of disorganization, so rife among us.&#xD;
The church and the ministry are our. only hope; and, I am&#xD;
sorry to say, these are beebming infected. Why, Messrs.&#xD;
N- and S- have left our church, Dr. H-'s church,&#xD;
because thq are too righteous to commune with slave-&#xD;
holders!"&#xD;
"I heard it with sorrow, Mr. Sewal; but while we deplore&#xD;
their errors, we must not forget that they are brethren,&#xD;
sincere, no doubt, but victims of a restless spirit of change&#xD;
and the pride of human reason. Let' ihe mind once get loose&#xD;
from sound, orthodox moorings, arid there is no telling where&#xD;
it will go; it is a melancholy fact. If these men were guided&#xD;
less by what they term reason, and more by a spirit of&#xD;
humility and prayer, they would be led to see how even&#xD;
human bondage may be reconciled with the law of love, and&#xD;
conduce to the salvation of this poor benighted ;race."&#xD;
All the while, during this speech, I had felt what aunt&#xD;
calls the "Lytton spirit" rising within me, and before the&#xD;
old gentleman ceased it had risen to my lips. But I mas-&#xD;
tered it'aud said, quietly, "Pardon me, sir. A few moments&#xD;
since you were kind enough to explain to me why such men&#xD;
as 0-- and S-Jcannot be instruments of Providence,&#xD;
and yet, if I apprehend you aright now, we are to view the&#xD;
miscreants employed in the slave trade as so many mission-&#xD;
aries engaged in the conversion of souls."&#xD;
JJncle arched his eyebrows to a point, in surprise and hor-&#xD;
ror, but the good old doctor only smiled benevolently as he&#xD;

but a fair specimen of womanly logic. 'By no means; I&#xD;
would be the last to justify evil; but there are sOme things&#xD;
which we do not understand, - some things permitted to us,&#xD;
as to the ancient Hebrews, perhaps, on accotiit of the hard-&#xD;

these, doubtless for some wise end; that, though he moves in&#xD;
a mysterious way, he can and doth overrule them all for his&#xD;
own glory and the salvati~u of man. We must not attempt&#xD;

connected with the degradation or elevation Qf man, I thought&#xD;
it might be discussed in all its bearings without once being&#xD;
guilty of that sin. "Bitt," I went on, "I do not feel con-&#xD;

had a Paixhan shot fallen in our midst, it could not have&#xD;
excited greater consternation and horror than my poor words.&#xD;
Uncle, with his silver fork arrested midway between hi~&#xD;
mouth and the table, looked as if the powers of speech, and&#xD;
what he prizes quite as highly, mastication, had deserted him&#xD;
forever; aunt set down her tumbler, and crossed her hands&#xD;
with an indescribable air, as if she saw, behind my. abolition-&#xD;
ism, bloomerism, woman's-rightsism, fourierism, sedition, arson&#xD;
and murder; H------ forgot his usual revenue, and sat pouring&#xD;
the gravy unconsciously over his plate, while the old doctor,&#xD;
with a despondent shake of the head, and with a tone, in&#xD;
which gr~e reproof struggled with real kindness, replied,&#xD;
"Very l~l~ely, for, 'the carnal heart is at enmity' with&#xD;
God; and, my young friend, if we take your words as a cri-&#xD;
terion, I fear we~ shall find you look at this subject with&#xD;
anything but an eye of humble, trusting faith,: You are&#xD;
tinctured with the besetting sin of the age, the pride of hit-&#xD;
rna~n reason, that blind guide which leads so many astray.&#xD;
It is a poor prop, my child, - a poor prop, as you will find&#xD;
sooner or later. Not until you are willing to cast it aside&#xD;
and look at this great subject with an humble, unquestioning&#xD;
spirit, will the wisdom of the overruling hand be made appa-&#xD;

heart, are these things made known, but to babes and suck-&#xD;

Old age! old age! White hairs and furrowed brows! 0, what&#xD;
a power ye have to move this self-willed heart of mine! As&#xD;
I looked up in his face, and met the calm but faded blue eyes&#xD;
bent on me half in sorrow, half in surprise, and thought how,&#xD;
in early youth, the foundations of his faith had been laid in&#xD;
sincerity and prayer; how it had grown with his growth,&#xD;
and strengthened with his strength, until it eticlosed him, as&#xD;
within a consecrated temple, whose pillars were intertwined&#xD;
with dear heart-memories, hopes that lived now, only in th~&#xD;
'light of faith, sorrows that had grown into hopes; I felt how&#xD;
0&#xD;
&#xD;
worthy of all' respect is every form or creed that has typified&#xD;
truth to the human soul, and, stretching forth my hand to the&#xD;
old man, was about to try to translate something of this feel-&#xD;
ing into words, when uncle's jaws collapsed, and he 'inter-&#xD;
rupted 'me, in his coldest, most frigid tones:&#xD;
"Elizabeth - Miss %ytton - I am astonished, perfectly as-&#xD;
tonished, to hear such sentiments advanced by a woman, and&#xD;
a relative of mine! Good heavens.! what are we coming to?&#xD;
Let me tell you, that the ladies of your mother's family. found&#xD;
ample room for their talents in the sphere which God assigned&#xD;
them, domestic life. They were early taught that /Wdman's&#xD;
province is to obey, not reason."&#xD;
The tone roused my antagonism at once, and~t said, coldly,&#xD;
"Then, I am very sorry for them, uncle; fort wide as that&#xD;
sphere is, ignorant and narrow-minded men can narrow it&#xD;
down until 'it becomes little better than slavery. Besides,&#xD;
as God has actually endowed them with reason, they must&#xD;
find it extremely difficult, at times, to obey both God and&#xD;
"I see no such difficulty," he condescended to reply; "but,&#xD;
perhaps, the wisdom of this age may enlighten me. As to&#xD;
ignorance and narrowness, of course that is not the question&#xD;
with our family;" and, with an air that seemed to say that&#xD;
the question of woman's right to a separate individuality was&#xD;
settled forever, he began discussing the new postal arrange-&#xD;
~    ments, which H  - had started, and from that they went to&#xD;
"non-intervention," Kossuth, etc.&#xD;
I felt choked; I care not how much a person differs from&#xD;
me, I can respect his notions and try to understand his&#xD;
views, if he will only let me speak out my thought, and&#xD;
respect that as it is worthy. But this looking askance at all&#xD;
one says, this taking a poor soul's words with the tongs and&#xD;
throwing them out the window, or fumigating them with salt&#xD;
and vinegar until there is no life in them, before they are per-&#xD;

one speak out his own convictions truly, and take them, rich&#xD;
or poor, as a godsend. We should lose something in smooth-&#xD;
ness and polish; many relations, now dovetailed together with&#xD;
suoja care, would find themselves breaking apart; but we~should&#xD;
be infinite gainers in honesty, ht~rmony and truth.&#xD;
Nov. 14th. - Scene, a beautifully furnished roim, the&#xD;
chairs, tables, sofa, what-not, etc., drawn up against the wall&#xD;
with as much precision as a company of the great Frederick's&#xD;
soldiers, -Miss Elizabeth Lytton seated on an ottoman, read-&#xD;
ing Mrs. Browning's noble poem, "Casa Guidi Windows."&#xD;
Enter Aunt Sewal, who goes through with a critical review&#xD;
of the furniture, occasionally passing her delicate cambric&#xD;
handkerchief over it, to ~see if Mary has left a particle of&#xD;
dust, while she~ keeps up a kind of miserere over the care-&#xD;
lessness of servants, and the troubles of housekeepers in&#xD;
general.&#xD;
"Dear me, Mary has n't half dusted the rooi~n! It is too&#xD;
bad to hire servants and do your work yourself! And that&#xD;
Sophie, too! Elizabeth, don't you think that Sophie has&#xD;
completely ruined my elegant coffee-pot, - melted off the&#xD;
spout! I do feel as if I should fly every time I think of it!&#xD;
Such an elegant one as it was!"&#xD;
Elizabeth is buried in this passage,&#xD;
"The dead upon their awful vantage ground,      /&#xD;
The sun not in their faces, shall abstract&#xD;
No more our strength; we will not be discrowned,&#xD;
Though treasuring their crowns, nor deign transact&#xD;
A barter for the present, in a sound&#xD;
For what was counted good in foregone days.&#xD;
0, dead, ye shall no longer cling to us!&#xD;
we will not be oblivious&#xD;
Of our own lives because ye lived before,&#xD;
Nor of ou~' acts because ye acted well;&#xD;
We thank ye that ye first unlatched the door,&#xD;
We will not make it inaccessible&#xD;
By thankings in the door-way any more," etc.,&#xD;
&#xD;
and looks up, with all the glorious hopes it suggests warming&#xD;
her heart, and exclaims,&#xD;
"How beautiful !"&#xD;
"Yes, indeed, twice as handsome as Mrs. A-'s, arid&#xD;
cost only the same. And to think it should be spoiled!"&#xD;
Elizabeth opens her great, gray eyes in astonishment. "Hover&#xD;
what, aunt ? - I don't quite understandd"&#xD;
"No, I dare say not; no one ever does think it worth while&#xD;
to understand me or my troubles,- your uncle never does.&#xD;
As long as everything is on the table at the precise moment,&#xD;
he never asks how it has been done, or how much I have been&#xD;
tried. I said that careless Sophie has melted off the spout&#xD;
to my coffee-pot."&#xD;
It was evident that aunt's usual pattern-like eqi~animity&#xD;
was sorely disturbed, and that she expected me to syrnpathiz~&#xD;
with her; but, having never experienced the loss of a coffee-&#xD;
urn spigot, I was somewhat at loss what to say or do; so I&#xD;
merely suggested that it could be mended.&#xD;
"Mended ! - anpld, tinkered, mended thing on my table!"&#xD;
(N. B. Aunt prides herself on setting the nicest table in the&#xD;
neighborhood.) "What would the E-s and the F-s&#xD;
think?"&#xD;
IL ventured another suggestion, thti~t she might purchase&#xD;
another. And so she might, she hoped, a dozen if she chose,&#xD;
but they would not be half so good as her old one. Mr.&#xD;
li-'s assortment! she did n't want any one to tell her about&#xD;
such things. Her old one was worth a dozen of th9m; she&#xD;
had used it two years, and not a dent in it. What did&#xD;
I know about coffee-pots?&#xD;
I saw my failure, and tried another tack, - Sophie's sore&#xD;
row over the accident, - but this was only adding fuel to the&#xD;
fire.&#xD;
Well she might be sorry. To know no bQtter than to set&#xD;
her urn down before a red-hot range, after all she had done&#xD;

for~her, too! And.she tripped out of the room to receive a&#xD;
niorning call, and pour her sorrows into a more appreciating&#xD;
ear, IL trust.&#xD;
As for me, the steam from that unfortunate urn had com-&#xD;
pletely dissolved my drean of a glorious future for Italy; so&#xD;
IL sat and wondered why aunt's servants were supposed to be&#xD;
under such infinite obligations to her, unless, indeed, she looked&#xD;
at the matter philosophically, and considered herself in the&#xD;
light of a Heaveti-sent trial, to exercise them in the rare virtue&#xD;
of patience.&#xD;
Nov. 14th. - IL was sitting by the table to-day- improvis-&#xD;
ing all sorts of designs upon a piece' of Bristol board, and&#xD;
thinking over my first lesson in drawing, and the quizzical&#xD;
face of "my master," when he asked me whether it was in-&#xD;
tended for a horse or a hou~e - when aunt looked up from the&#xD;
wristband she was stitching, and asked what IL was doing.&#xD;
"Not much of anything," II answered. "IL sat down to&#xD;
make a horse for little bubby Lee."&#xD;
"Is that child here again, to-day?" she asked, sharply.&#xD;
"No, I promised him some days ago."&#xD;
"IL really should think, Elizabeth, that child had enough to'&#xD;
spoil him, without you. His mother and grandmother make&#xD;
a fool of him; and Mary, she must be running home every&#xD;
other day to see him; or, what is worse, he is brought over&#xD;
here. I shall put a stop to this. IL can't abide children!"&#xD;
I looked up in her pretty, delicate, well-kept face, in won-&#xD;
dering surprise; but when, a moment after, she turned and&#xD;
spoke so caressingly to her pet canary, I knew that in the&#xD;
above assertion she had belied herself and the good God.&#xD;
Earth without children! 0, 1 do not believe that He sends a&#xD;
single soul into this world, to bear long, weary years of toil&#xD;
and sorrow, unbrightened by the love for little children! No,&#xD;
nor that heaven can be heaven without childish faces and&#xD;
childish voices; oi that paradise was quite paradise without.&#xD;

them! IL did not 'shock aunt by my heresies, however, Lint&#xD;
said, gayly,&#xD;
"0, IL don't wonder at Mary! If I had such a nephew~ IL&#xD;
would go twice as far to get a look at his healthy, happy ~hee,&#xD;
any day. It is enough to put one in good humor for a month.&#xD;
IL wish IL had just such a boy!"&#xD;
IL had shocked her, but had only time to catch her "Why,&#xD;
Elizabeth Lytton!" when a hearty laugh, followed by a deep&#xD;
voice, crying, "A right, true, honest, womanly wish! Stick&#xD;
to the truth, Bessie, and shame the devil!" ~tarted me, and IL&#xD;
turned to see the ample proportions of~ IDr. G-.-- fllliiig the&#xD;
door-way, while his cheerful, intelligent face beamed down&#xD;
upon us from above the' barriers of his fur collar, warm, heart-&#xD;
inspiring as the sun itself.&#xD;
IL sprang forward to meet him, for a short illness haB made&#xD;
me acquainted with his excellences, and, what is bett~r~ won&#xD;
him to be my friend, but stopped short when he moved ~his&#xD;
broad shoulders aside, and IL saw that he was accompanied by&#xD;
11-.--- and Harold T-.--; T-.-----, whom IL had not met in&#xD;
more than a year.&#xD;
IL fancy IL have some control over my nerves, but this rush-&#xD;
ing current of blood is quite another thing. IL felt it pouring&#xD;
to my heart like water in a mill-race, impelling me to spring&#xD;
forward and meet him; but IL mastered it, and listened, as,&#xD;
with my hand buried in his great palm, the doctor went on,&#xD;
"Get along, II-, and pay your respects to your aunt.&#xD;
Mr. T-, let me introduce you to a young friend of mine,&#xD;
Miss Elizabeth Lytton, a good, sensible sort of~ a girl1 who,-&#xD;
if it were not for a certain Lydia Mason - well,' well, if&#xD;
there were no ifs in th6 world some strange 'thing&amp;amp; would&#xD;
happen."&#xD;
This Lydia Mason is no other than the doctor's excellent&#xD;
wife, whop, according to him, stands in the way of his wedding&#xD;
as many wives as Solomon. IL turned to T-.-; but, 0,&#xD;

your mysterious temples one figure which can outrival, the calm&#xD;
immobility and cool indifference of his face, as, slightly touch-&#xD;
ing my hand, he passed the usual compliments, and moved on&#xD;
to be introduced to my aunt.&#xD;
What could it mean? He was the successful lawyer now;&#xD;
did he mean to ignore all memories and things connected with&#xD;
his earlier struggles? Possibly so; and for one moment I felt&#xD;
what Agassiz means by "Ice Periods."&#xD;
The old doctor drew me along to a quiet sofa, and soon I&#xD;
roused myself enough to listen to his conversation; it was all&#xD;
of T-. His father had been an old college friend of his,&#xD;
a man of unstable mind, who was unfortunate in everything,&#xD;
if a man could really be said to be unfortunate who possessed&#xD;
such a son (the doctor is childless) -"the noblest, best boy&#xD;
that ever lived; the kindest, most considerate of sons"- and,&#xD;
though T-.---. had never spoken to me much of his youth,&#xD;
I knew it must have been so - "'~mother, a lovely woman, died&#xD;
when he was a mere boy, - he 's the very image of her, -&#xD;
poor Ellen Bryne! I knew her as a girl;" and the good man's&#xD;
great, blue eyes filled with tears as he gazed proudly upon&#xD;
T-, who stood talking with aunt.&#xD;
"She was a cousin of mine," he added,- and it was well he&#xD;
did so, for IL began to wonder if some Lydia Mason had not&#xD;
stood between them, so marked was his interest, - "my cous-&#xD;
in, and her boy inherited her spirit; educated himself', grad-&#xD;
uated with high hon6r, and had just commenced the studyof&#xD;
law in the office of Judge B-, when the man, in whose&#xD;
hands the remnant of their property was deposited, failed, and&#xD;
left his' father, broken down, feeble, purposeless and en~rgy-&#xD;
less, dependent upon him for support. He gave up his studies&#xD;
at once, and took the situation of principal of an academy in&#xD;
- well, somewhere in your region, IL '11 be hanged' if I can&#xD;
remember the place, but somewhere on the Sound."&#xD;
There was no need of his remembering - IL did.&#xD;
"He staid there two years, when his father happily died.&#xD;
&#xD;
Don't stare at me for saying happily, child. I did n't pro-&#xD;
scribe for him; besides, you cannot have lived in the world&#xD;
thus long, without seeing that there are some people in it&#xD;
who are evidently out of place.' Mr. T- was one of them&#xD;
- so he happily died.&#xD;
"Noi~ his son is a member of the NewFlaven bar, one of&#xD;
the most talented of his class, and is here, as counsel in the&#xD;
great case of' Higgins versus Howe.' A noble fellow," added&#xD;
the good man, rubbing his hands; "you must make his&#xD;
acquaintance, surely."&#xD;
So he had ignored me to one who, it seemed, was his hear-&#xD;
est friend. Well, IL can be as proud as Harold T-, any&#xD;
day; so I chatted with the doctor and 11-, who came and&#xD;
took the seat on the other side of me, and allowed him to*&#xD;
*    wind the crochet purse I was netting over his delicate ~1ngers&#xD;
(IL do wonder why he cannot let my work alone), and tease to&#xD;
know if it was ~ designed for him, unchecked. Once T-.---&#xD;
looked over that way with a glance that an hour before I&#xD;
would not have met for worlds - even now, it disturbed me&#xD;
for a moment; but I thought, what right has Harold' T-'-~-&#xD;
S&#xD;
to stir my blood thus? Have I thought of him as "my&#xD;
master" until the sportive title has become real, and I am a.&#xD;
slave to cower thus before his glance? So IL glanced back&#xD;
like a northern iceberg; but, only a few moments after, I&#xD;
found myself yielding to the old fascination of his tones, as&#xD;
he discussed Whipple~s lecture of the evening before, and, in&#xD;
roply to some remark of II-, analyzed the lecture and&#xD;
the lecturer in his calm, clear way, meting out praise and&#xD;
censure like a god. How those tones recalled the past!&#xD;
My heart made pictures: there was the small parlor look-&#xD;
ing out upon the sea - mother on the lounge with her book&#xD;
and knitting the two figures by the table, one occasionally&#xD;
looking up from her drawing to answer some remark with&#xD;
which the other had interrupted his reading; and then that&#xD;

voice swept on again, to the accompaniment of the restless&#xD;
waters. IDid he not remember it, too?&#xD;
IL was rous.~d from my reverie by aunt's voice:&#xD;
"G-2---; why, that is where you and your mother lived&#xD;
awhile, Elizaketh. You must have been there about the same&#xD;
time with Mr. T&#xD;
IL looked T-.-----. coolly in the face a second, before I replied,&#xD;
"Yes, aunt."&#xD;
Before she could question or comment, T- said, with&#xD;
half a smile, "Miss Lytton is no stranger to me; IL have had&#xD;
the honor of meeting her before."&#xD;
"The deuce you have!" began the old doctorr; but, having&#xD;
a sort of instinctive perception, IL presume, that there was&#xD;
something beside Lydia Mason in the way here, he very wise-&#xD;
ly paused, and set to teasing H- about his boot. Aunt,&#xD;
unfortunately, had not his foresight. She kept on: "In..&#xD;
deed, and Elizabeth is so much changed you. hardly knew her.&#xD;
Don't you think the change for the better? We flatter our-&#xD;
selves ills." T- ~bowed, and IL prayed that aunt might&#xD;
be attacked with bronchitis - anything to stop her mouth; but&#xD;
she kept on. "We think a year or so with us will quite&#xD;
overcome her country manners - give her quite a refined ana&#xD;
elegant air."&#xD;
"lPshaw, Mrs. Sewal!" fell in the doctor; "we don't want&#xD;
any air but a natural one; and the girl has that now. Don't&#xD;
get ~any such nonsense into your head, child."&#xD;
ll-~ and T-'- both laughed, ana IL was glad when&#xD;
they left, after aunt haa politely invited T-. to "call&#xD;
again."&#xD;
Nov. 17th. I ought to feel flattered, I suppose; for aunt,&#xD;
if IL do not greatly mistake her, actually thinks IL may do for a&#xD;
wife for her idol, H-. Whether II- has, had any hand&#xD;

IL don't believe any one Can have patience with such. weather;&#xD;
not even the "Shepherd of Salisbury Plain," especially if~he&#xD;
had been shut up in the house with Aunt Sewal all flay, ay,&#xD;
and all night, too, fbr uncle is absent, and she has insisted on&#xD;
my occupying a cot-bed in her room, as a sort of guard - IL,&#xD;
who sleep like a stone! But IL was obliged to yield, under&#xD;
fear of seeming disobliging; and so have been lulled to sleep,&#xD;
every night, by a kind of doxology on H-.--.---'s perfection.&#xD;
IL am cross and out of patience, and would welcome even a&#xD;
slight shock of earthquake, if it would shake up aunt's ideas,&#xD;
arid give them a new direction. IL like ll-.; IL liked the&#xD;
way in which he defended poor Fanny R-.-----. the other day,&#xD;
who, to say the least, has been more sinned against than&#xD;
sinning. He took me by surprise. IL find, under the crust&#xD;
of fashion and conventionality, a good substratum of common&#xD;
sense; and I would draw it out, and make ~he most of it, if&#xD;
it were not for this ridiculous plot of aunt's, and a kind of&#xD;
fancy IL have, that the gentleman does, at times, think hi~-&#xD;
self irresistible. IL wonder what makes most men fancy that~&#xD;
every unmarried woman is ready to fall into their arms, just&#xD;
like a fly~ into a cup of sweetened water? Is it because they&#xD;
are so much like sweetened water? Why cannot they have&#xD;
sense enough to see that a woman may really like their socie-&#xD;
ty, and feel a sincere regard for them, without "being in love&#xD;
with them,". as the phrase runs? And why cannot the world,&#xD;
so owlish-eyed in most things, see that such a relation m&amp;amp;y&#xD;
exist without any desire or intention, on the part of either of&#xD;
the parties, to endow, Or be endowed, "with alltheir worldly&#xD;
goods"? It would be such a gain to be able to say to a&#xD;
person, "I like you," without being misunderst~odl lilt's a&#xD;

singing up the stairs, she calls, "See, Miss Elizabeth! It 's&#xD;
elpa~ring up!"&#xD;
"How can you bear to sing in such weary, rainy weather,&#xD;
Mary?"&#xD;
"0,1 do~t kno'~; I-sing without thinking; I suppose it 's&#xD;
a habit I 'ye got. IL was thinking how nice this rain was for&#xD;
people who needed water! You know it ha~ been so dry all&#xD;
the fall, Miss, that the cisterns and wells are very low. IBe-&#xD;
sides, if one is contented, it does n't much matter about the&#xD;
weather ; -at least, mother says so," she added, in a hesitating&#xD;
way.&#xD;
Contented - satisfied with one's self? Ay, that is it.&#xD;
Have n't j[ been all the week restless, dissatisfied, and uneasy,&#xD;
layiiig all my misery to the weather? And why? It is&#xD;
time to face this question boldly. Because IL dare not look&#xD;
into my heart, fearing to find there a love for Harold T&#xD;
which is neither sister's 'nor friend's; that I have disgraced&#xD;
my womanhood by loving unsought, nnasked? No; tbat is&#xD;
the ~world's utterance, the world's law, not mine. ill am truer,&#xD;
1e~ter, for that love ; the shame - no, pain li6s here, that&#xD;
II~e may, has suspected it, and will teach me its futility. 'T is&#xD;
well; he shall find, me not weak, nor backward in seconding&#xD;
his aim. I will meet this truth like a woman who is bent&#xD;
upon doing her best under all life's trials! And yet, what&#xD;
can I put in its place? The love of God? Alas, the heart&#xD;
is humanly weak!&#xD;
"See, Miss Elizabeth! a light streak in the west. We&#xD;
shall have fair weather to-morrow!" cries Mary, from a dis-&#xD;
tant chamber.&#xD;
"Yes, I see!" Thank God that there are, also, light&#xD;
streaks in the darkest hours of destiny, if we have but faith&#xD;
and patisnee to watch and -wait. It will dawn for m~, yet!&#xD;
Evening. - Uncle has returned from New York, bringing&#xD;
dress-patterns for aunt and me. Mine is a very nice Turo&#xD;
satin.- aunt's a splendid watered silk. "It is proper that&#xD;
&#xD;
DIARY.                ,&#xD;
my niece should be well dressed; I like to see her s6," wa~&#xD;
uncle's reply to my thanks. I wish he had notsaid just that;&#xD;
but, then, I am very grateful. I need the dre~s very much;&#xD;
all tJw~ more because Miss Emilia Cranston, aunt's niece, i~&#xD;
conk~/up to spend the holidays here, ai~4 -my ~d black silk&#xD;
would look quite shabby~ I fear. Mother thought I could&#xD;
afford to have a new one, before I left home, especially if she*&#xD;
gave up buying an alpaca; but I convinced her that the&#xD;
alpaca must be had. I confess I am not philosophical&#xD;
enough to get quite above this matter of dress. I think there&#xD;
is more in the mind's craving for perfect harmony and fitness&#xD;
* in outward things, than many of our ~sages admit. The dress&#xD;
of every Woma~ should be evolved from her own mind -an in-&#xD;
dication of the grace, truth, purity, and beauty within. Haw-&#xD;
thorne understands this; - the dark robe of Hester IPrynne,&#xD;
the gay scarlet of "little Pearl," the rusty silk~ of Miss&#xD;
Hepzibah, and the variegated dressing-gown of poor Clifford,&#xD;
are redolent of character. Only as the "outward and A~&#xD;
sign" of the inward harmony should dress be made a s~t~ ~ -&#xD;
never for vulgar display. I am glad Miss Cranston is c&#xD;
They say she is a belle and a beauty; but, as I shall interfere -~&#xD;
- with her in neither of these matters, IL fancy we shall be ex-&#xD;
cellent friends.&#xD;

orating. the rush of keen winter air, as we dashed down the&#xD;
W- road - the ice-bound river sparkling in the sun-&#xD;
light, and the bare brown hills leaning back lovingly against&#xD;
the sky! How I longed to turn my horse's head towards&#xD;
these hills! I knew that among, them there must be sunny&#xD;
valleys, like the on~ ~in which IL had, taken my first lesson on&#xD;
horseback, and. I seemed to descry the very mountain paths~&#xD;
~up which Annie IB-.- and IL had urged our horses, on our&#xD;
whortleberrying expeditions to the hills. Poor Annie B&#xD;
- no, happy Annie ! -her feet have long since trod the dark&#xD;
valley, and the opposite slopes have been smoothed for her&#xD;
by angel hands.&#xD;
Perhaps ll-.---., too, had his memories; for he said, after&#xD;
a long silence, as we sat watching the scene:&#xD;
"I like to go out on a winter's day like this, the air is so&#xD;
still, clear and cold~ It seems to take from life all that i~&#xD;
merely accidental and factitious, and show it to us in it~&#xD;
~4~hal dignity and purity. IL feel belittled when obliged to&#xD;
go back to the daily routine of petty cares. Have you never&#xD;
f~11 this, Miss Ibytton?"&#xD;
"Often, very often," IL said, in pleased surprise. "But,&#xD;
my friend, do we take the lesson aright, if we fail to gain&#xD;
from it wisdom and strength to dignify these same petty&#xD;
details?"&#xD;
"You are right - you are always right, Miss Lytton!"&#xD;
he said, thoughtfully. And so we chatted on, of life and&#xD;
Iifa?,s duties, until: we reached home. Was there4 or was&#xD;
tb~r~ not, a closer pressure of my hand than needf~il, when&#xD;
he helped me from the horse? Henceforth, I think t shall&#xD;
be countrified, and spring off unassisted.&#xD;

His talent, his eloquence, meet me on every side ~ prophecies&#xD;
of his future success; and IL rejoice - miserable confession!&#xD;

.Nov. 27th. At widow tee's.&#xD;
They sleep at last, these poor, grief-stricken women, and I&#xD;
am left alone with the child. As he turns hi~ swollen, pur-&#xD;
ple face uneasily on the pillow, and I think how soon it may&#xD;
lie quite still beneath the winter snow, my eyes fill with tears&#xD;
and my heart aches; but not for the little one whose feet&#xD;
have wandered but such a little way from the gate of heaven,&#xD;
      but fo~ the~iother and grandmother, along whose tlr~ry&#xD;
path he seems the only visible sunbeam. His disease is si~ar-&#xD;

him a taste of it, for I shall not leave these poor peop1~&#xD;
til some one wiser than I comes to take my place; and&#xD;
will not be immediately, I fancy, for the neighbors ha ill&#xD;
little children, whom they dare not expose to the infectioji.&#xD;
I have no fear and these poor women cling to me and look&#xD;
up to me as if I were Minerva herself.&#xD;
It is good to have one's energies taxed thus, and I thank&#xD;
Heaven for this experience, and every other that has taught&#xD;
me wisdom, or t~iade me stronger for the battle of life. Mary.&#xD;
and I do' everything, from the dropping of the medieb~n'~&#xD;

early schooling that taught me how to "make the most of&#xD;
little" as now.&#xD;

when I heard Dr. G-~ calling me from the little entry.&#xD;
Toasting-fork in hand, I hurried out, and found my hands,&#xD;
bread, fork and all, clasped in those of H-, who, oblivi-&#xD;
ous of his fawn-colored gloves, poured forth inquiries after&#xD;
my health.&#xD;
"There, now you have seen her alive and well, with your&#xD;
own eyes," interrupted the doctor, as I was assuring him of&#xD;
iiiy well-being, "IL hope you are satisfied. I could n't get&#xD;
rid of the fellow, Bessie," he went on, "though I assured&#xD;
him you were never so well nor so handsome ~tn your life;&#xD;
though you have got a 'beauty spot' on your~cheek - it&#xD;
answers for a patch, dear," he went on, grim~oing, as IL&#xD;
raised my apron to efface the grim mark of the bread or&#xD;
something else. "He doubted my honor as a Christian man,&#xD;
the jackanapes, and insisted on seeing you with his own eyes.&#xD;
Hang him! he might teach perseverance to the saints."&#xD;
"And in return for this interest I must turn him out the&#xD;
acor. Indeed," I said, as I put out my hand to prevent his&#xD;
further entrance, "you must not come in. You can do no&#xD;
good, and you may do harm to yourself and others."&#xD;
"And yet you; stay here, Miss Lytton, and peril your own&#xD;
life, so dear to all your friends!" he said reproachfully. "Is&#xD;
there nothing I can do?"&#xD;
"Yes, you can play the widow's good angel, and replenish&#xD;
our coal-bin; for I confess IL don't understand the art of&#xD;
saving coal in such weather."&#xD;
"But is there nothing else - nothing I can do for you?"&#xD;
"Yes, you can go away now, and tell uncle and aunt that&#xD;
~I '~in well, and thank them for; permitting me to stay here."&#xD;
"IL almost forgot to tell you that Emilia Cranston arrived&#xD;
yesterday," he said~&#xD;
"Then you can take my place, and play the agreeable to&#xD;
her," I said, laughing, as I shut the door in his face.&#xD;
"Coolly done, that," said the doctor. "Take a little of&#xD;
&#xD;
the starch out of that fellow, so that common sense will have&#xD;
full play, and he '11 do .-- he '11 do."&#xD;
Evening. - It has* been a terrible day- the little boy&#xD;
wrestling with death, and th&amp;amp; mother in hysterical Swoons.&#xD;
0, it is dreadful to see the sweet, innocent face of a child&#xD;
thus distorted with agony! My God, why need it be ?~ Mary&#xD;
and her mother have watched over Mrs. Lee, an~1~I have&#xD;
hung over the child until I can scarcely breathe. I don't&#xD;
know what ails me; the top of my head seems hot and heavy&#xD;
as burning lead.&#xD;
Later. -- Doctor has come, bringing with him a hard~&#xD;
featured, b6ny woman, whom he calls Mrs. Lane. She 4hrew&#xD;
off her things, and came up and shook my hand as if it had&#xD;
been a mat or piece of rug, saying, half way between a laugh&#xD;
and a cry:&#xD;
"So, you 'ye been here all alone, and are clean fagged out,&#xD;
as such a young crittur has a right to be; for I know t1zem~&#xD;
there" - with a nod towards the bedroom door, where A~he&#xD;
poor mother lay-"kind critters as ever breathed the&#xD;
breath o' life do anything for other folks, but not worth a&#xD;
snap when trouble teaches them. I 'ye thought on ye all, but&#xD;
Jim was laid up with rheumatic, so as he could n't stir band&#xD;
nor foot. But Jim 's as kin a crittur, I must say, as ever&#xD;
breathed; and when he heard how bad on 't you was down&#xD;
here, and the neighbors all skewered to death, he toiled me to&#xD;
send the boy oi~r io Aunt Sally's, and come over; and so I&#xD;
did."&#xD;
And she dropped my hand, and w~nt round the r6orn,; p~g~&#xD;
ting things in their places. I Talk of elastic steps and4airy&#xD;

leads us to step as lightly in a sick-room as did this p~or.&#xD;
Woman, we shall have some reason to be proud!&#xD;
Midnight. - Mrs. Lane and the doctor watch the child,&#xD;
while, too anxious to sleep, I sit and watch them. Again&#xD;

his fingers never leave the thin wrist. At last a light breaks&#xD;
over his face, and he whispers:&#xD;
"He will live, Bessie! The boy will live!"&#xD;
31 sprang to ~my feet, and was making for th~ bedroom,&#xD;
when he caught my hand.&#xD;
"You foolish woman! Will you bring that doting grand-&#xD;
mother and half-crazy mother upon us, to undo what little&#xD;
good we~have done? Wait an hou~ or so."&#xD;
So I sat down again, and began watching the play of his&#xD;
£~tures, and thinking I wished I could sketch them, just as&#xD;
1.e sat. I would rather hav~ his portrait than Kossuth's.&#xD;
"IDoctor."&#xD;
"Hush, you witch! Cannot you write what you have got&#xD;
to say, without yelling like a screechowl ?"&#xD;
So I took a slip of paper, and wrote:&#xD;
"Sit a little tQ the right, if you please, doctor."&#xD;
"What for?" in a whisper, hoarse as the voice of a&#xD;
young Shanghai.&#xD;
"I want to sketch your portrait."&#xD;
"What will you do with it?" Then, with a horrible&#xD;
grimace, "Will tha~ expression do?"&#xD;
"Put it in my cabinet of curiosities."&#xD;
"You can't have it. Do you not know it is written, 'Y~&#xD;
shall not make unto y~1wselves idols?'"&#xD;
"Ay, but they must be in the likeness of something in&#xD;
heaven above or the earth beneath, you know. It is enough&#xD;
for a reasonable man that I want it."&#xD;
He looked at me closely a moment, before he replied, -&#xD;
"Lydia Mason shall she, about that; but to prove that I&#xD;
am reasonable, I shall take you ~iome with me to-night. So.&#xD;
get your bonnet and cloak."&#xD;
"IL shall not go. Leave my charge because you say he is&#xD;
better!"&#xD;
"You will !"&#xD;
"I shan't! "&#xD;
&#xD;
Dec. 20th. At Dr. G-.--~'s.&#xD;
I did go; but how, or when~ jil have no distinct recollection.&#xD;
21?or many days there has been no morning nor evening for&#xD;
me; only fever, and pain, and delirium; thq, darkness that&#xD;
steals up from the valley of the shadow of death. 0, it is&#xD;
good to suffer; for, without this, we should never know half&#xD;
the kindness and love that lies deep hidden in some hearts!&#xD;
The rock must be smitten before the refreshing Wers will&#xD;
burst forth.&#xD;
What but this could have made unoje and aunt wate&#xD;
by my bedside; and the Lees,~ and Mrs. Lane, and W&#xD;
too, all so anxious to do something for me; and, best of&#xD;
all, glorious Doctor G- and his noble wife? Sur~i~ they&#xD;
will have their reward; "for I was a stranger and they took&#xD;
me in!"&#xD;
Here comes the doctor, holding up a letter; he frowns hor-&#xD;
ribly at the sight of my occupation. Well, well, I promise&#xD;
not another word to-day; and so I get my letter.&#xD;
Dec. 21st. - Mother's letter is unique. The dear wo~aan&#xD;
~ has all unconsciously achieved the desideratum in letter-writ-&#xD;
ing; for it places the home and neighborhood interests, cares&#xD;
and joys, as plainly before me as if IL were in the midst of&#xD;
them myself. Yet how strange such passagesas these wQuld~&#xD;
sound in the ears of many of my oit~ friends,&#xD;
instance, who is enthusiastic over th~ beauty of rural life:&#xD;
"Potatoes are going down,~and last week George i~-.-~-.&#xD;
carted all we have to spare to G-, at fifty cents'&#xD;
bushel. It makes quite a difference in the profits, as we reck-&#xD;
oned them; but I hope to ~nakn it up ~n the hay. That is&#xD;
rising, and Mr. F-.- advises m~ to keep it a while longer,&#xD;
thinking it will, get up to twen1~y diAlars per ton before spri~.&#xD;
It has been so warm that we have not butchered ~ j~gs&#xD;
yet; but Mr. F~- killed last week, and liis largest Weighed&#xD;

the work; so you need llQt W&amp;amp;ry about me."&#xD;

&#xD;
Yet, to me, that fall in the price of potatoes is a serious&#xD;
matter; for, if We cannot make up the difference somehow, we&#xD;
may find ourselves h~meIess; for our hard creditor, Mr.&#xD;
J-, gives us no choice - the interest of the mortgage, or&#xD;
the house ai4 few remaining acres themselves.&#xD;
Here is a~ postscript:&#xD;
"Be very careful to please your uncle and aunt, my child.&#xD;
It is ver~y kind in him to notice us, and his favor can be 'of&#xD;
grei~t advantage to you in many ways."&#xD;
there spoke .-not my~mother, but the worldly wisdom&#xD;
ich such natures as hers gain from circumstances.&#xD;
O,'the heaviest curse of poverty is not that we must earn&#xD;
our bread by the sweat of the brow, but the constant canker-&#xD;
ing care it brings, eating into the finest natures like rust!&#xD;
Men praise it as a teacher of great truths, and so it is;' but,&#xD;
if it sometimes develops the intellect, it not infrequently&#xD;
dwarfs the heart. To be free from these petty cares to be&#xD;
able to free others - to lift the leaden weights from the spirit,&#xD;
and give it a free development - this is why I would be&#xD;
rich.&#xD;
As to uncle's kindness in noticing us, methinks it would&#xD;
have been more apparent, and to the purpose, had he done it&#xD;
when you, my mother, were struggling to give an education to&#xD;
y6llr fatherless child! ~ when we have won for ourselves&#xD;
friends among the g~0#~nd learned, IL fancy it is no conde-&#xD;
scension in him to acknowledge "my niece."&#xD;
Dec. 22d. - H- an~ Niss Cranston called to see me&#xD;
to-day. She is beautiful, and was kind enough to express an&#xD;
earnest wish to have ,me retiiri~ to 'uncle's. H-.----. is cer-&#xD;
tainly losing his tact, or he ~~uld' ~tLever have forgotten him-&#xD;
self so far as to have said it was "'dull and stupid" 'at uncle's&#xD;
without me, and that lady by his side! ' I thought Miss&#xD;
Cranston, in spite of her retenue, looked rather annoyed. I.&#xD;
never knew him guilty of such a 4eti~e before?&#xD;
Dec. 23d. - IL am to go hom&amp;amp; after dinner, Christmas-day.&#xD;
&#xD;
/ "      Aunt has been here, and doctor and she have finally, settled&#xD;
it thus. She was in excellent ~sphits, and talked. of the par-&#xD;
ties which were to be given during the holidays, and wWch&#xD;
Emilia and I would b~ expected to attend..~.~" such a good&#xD;
opportunity for me to see something of city life."'~';&#xD;
The doctor said nothing, but sat and drew coffins on the&#xD;
margin of the newspaper before him, as a sort of warning&#xD;
to me, I suppose, of the end to which these parties4 would&#xD;
lead; and somehow I grew sad and dismal, and was glad w~en&#xD;
aunt left. ~ '~ .&#xD;
Doctor and his wife are plotting some conspiracy~s I be~&#xD;

sad that I almost repented of my plotted mischief. He&#xD;

"The deuce you do!" his face evidently brightening~&#xD;
"Who could have told you?"&#xD;
"0, it 's an age of wonders; p iaps the rapping spirits.&#xD;
Of course IL should not be left long i~tgziorance of what so&#xD;
nearly concerns me."&#xD;
"True," and he seated himself 1y my side, and looked at&#xD;
me long and earnestly, before I~ie ~added, "Then you don't&#xD;
care for this, child?"&#xD;
"Yes, indeed, very ~uoh~ D~ I. might care a little more~&#xD;

ow~d them.&#xD;
"Sunlight ~. I wish it was! Such a miserable earth as&#xD;
this is! fiU~d with all manner of rascalities. I have tried to&#xD;
'-4&#xD;
make the best of it until I am tired, and ~the sooner it is&#xD;
burned up the better!" And he got up and gave the fore-&#xD;
stick a kick (he insists on my sitting by a wood fire) that sent&#xD;
a shower of sparks up the chimney, as a preliminary,' I sup-&#xD;
pope to ~the grand conflagration he deemed so desirable.&#xD;
Seeing he ~was seriously disturbed about something, Ii&#xD;
repressed the jest that rose to my lips, and waited his next&#xD;
words in silences&#xD;
"I feel just as if I could fight, Bessie," he said at length,&#xD;
settling himself in the chair by my side. "I am angry at&#xD;
myself and everybody else, yourself included, for I have some-&#xD;
thing to say to you, and you don't help me a bit."&#xD;
"To me!" I said, rather startled. "What is it?"&#xD;
"It is what you will deem an impertinent question; but,&#xD;
tell me, child," - he went on very seriously, 'taking my hands&#xD;
in his, .-" has Harold T------ ever been to you aught but a&#xD;
friend? - ever by word or glance sought to win your lov&amp;amp;?"&#xD;
"Doctor G-, will you tell me why I am to answer this&#xD;
question - which - whloli"&#xD;
''~ Does not concern me, you would say. Can you not trust&#xD;
me thus far, my child, without a reason?" he asked. "IL said&#xD;
by word or glance," he added., seeing me still hesitate.&#xD;
0, words of mocking raillery, high courage, and earnest&#xD;
interest, - glances whose mission begun when that of words&#xD;
ended, - how ye stood out fi~om the past! but not one which&#xD;
might not have fallen from a brother's~1ip or eye! And so I&#xD;
told the doctor, and more, how that I had met him at a&#xD;
period when my moral and intellectual being were 'struggling&#xD;
for some wider. development than contented those around me;&#xD;
how he had kindly slackened his own swift pace in the march&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DIARt                    35'&#xD;
of progress, to ~aid my stumbling steps; how'he~ had been&#xD;
teacher, friend, master, but nothing more; an earnest&#xD;
"Thank dod!" was the reply.&#xD;
"But may I know," I added, 'after a ent's p~t.use,&#xD;
"whatledyoutosupposesuchathing?~~&#xD;
"He told me himself that he had boarded ~with yo~zr&#xD;
mother more than a year, and, knowing you both, I could not&#xD;
well conceive ho~ it could be otherwise; besides"&#xD;
"NVhat, doctor?"&#xD;
"I would not say what, were it not needed to e4lain i~y~ ;&#xD;
impertinence. You were delirious when' yow~ were ill,&#xD;
and ".-.&#xD;
I saw it all, and buried my burning face in my hands,&#xD;
while tears of womanly pride rushed to my eyes.&#xD;
In a moment or two, he gently raised my head as he said,&#xD;
"Forgive me, Bessie. It was but the raving of delirium I&#xD;
am convinced. I would n't have distressed you so for a less~&#xD;
reason."&#xD;
"What is that reason?" I asked, looking him once more&#xD;
firmly in the face.&#xD;
"Harold T- is about to marry the niece of Judge&#xD;
A-, the widow N-..---.~ I have it on what I believe good&#xD;
authority; and I could not 'bear to think that he who had&#xD;
stood to me in the stead of the children God has denied n~e,&#xD;
was an unmitigated scoundrel;' It is bad, enough as ~it is!"&#xD;
I drew my hand from his, that he might not mark the&#xD;
throbbing pulse, and~ after a moment's silence, a~ked,&#xD;
"This Mrs. N-~-; what kind of woman is she? One&#xD;
worthy of Harold T---.. V'&#xD;
'"Yes, rteh,,and vain, and ambitious!" he replied, getting&#xD;
up and kicking the fire, as if he were punishing Harold by&#xD;
proxy. "I wonder Leould be so aAgry' when Mr. X--.-.&#xD;
expressed surprise that she should stoop to him!"&#xD;
"That i~ no answer to my question, doctor. Is she&#xD;
worthy of li~nit"&#xD;
&#xD;
C9&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7687-00000019"/>&#xD;
"'Be~sie," he said, again sitting down, "I had got a plan&#xD;
Into my head~w~iich this news has sadly disturbed, and, like&#xD;
most positiyerne~i, when they see their schemes thwarted, am&#xD;
cross andAll4~bapered. Perhaps I would play the part of&#xD;
Providence~ too much, and so am reminded of my weaknej~s.&#xD;
]Is~ she worthy? b~it, tell me, what should Harold's wife be&#xD;
like?"&#xD;
"Like that," I said, pointing to a drift of unsullied snow&#xD;
without; "pure in thought, word and deed; yielding to him&#xD;
li1~e that~ to the rays of the sun, but firm to all the world&#xD;
beside. $1i~ must be all the world to him, or nothing."&#xD;
"And Harriet N-is likelier to be something to all the&#xD;
w0rld than to her husband, unless her passion for admiration&#xD;
be much abated," he replied, dryly. "He must be attracted&#xD;
by her wealth, and the connection the match will afford him.&#xD;
Her uncle has offered him a ~partnership in his office, I hear.&#xD;
I will never attempt to judge character again, so honest, so&#xD;
self-reliant, he seemed. He t~ame here to inquire after you&#xD;
twice before he left the city, and, when he turned away&#xD;
his face, as I spoke of your danger~, II thought but 't was&#xD;
all a sham. 0, he has grown scheming betimes! He will&#xD;
be a judge, yet!"&#xD;
Why should he ask after me at all? What was I to him,&#xD;
~what could I give him ? - this poor, undeveloped girl, who&#xD;
had caught light a~nd life from his teachings.&#xD;
And then I thought of the beautiful and accomplished&#xD;
Mrs. N-; of all she could do for him, the weary struggles&#xD;
which her position and wealth might save him -~- those strug-&#xD;
gles which ever attend the first years of a poor professional&#xD;
man's life and I spoke of this to Dr. G-.&#xD;
"Better that he face them like a man, than escape by a&#xD;
mercenary marriage!" thundered he. "It is just that which&#xD;
gives strength and stamina to the character! Faugh! I de-&#xD;
spise such cowardice."&#xD;
&#xD;
I:&#xD;
&#xD;
s a&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
"But the marriage may not be mercenary. He aoubtless&#xD;
loves her, and she cannot fail of loving Harold. T-.-.."&#xD;
"Others have, it seems," -he answered dryly; tli~j went on&#xD;
alternately berating them both, until, for old kindness' sake,&#xD;
IL roused myself to interfere.&#xD;
"You wrong them, doctor. You are angry,- and so wroi~g&#xD;
them both. This Mrs. N- is not unworthy simply becau~0&#xD;
she is fashionable. Besides, you say, she ihas two children;&#xD;
and she cannot be quite the frivolous thing you make her&#xD;
out, with such a bridge between her and heaven."&#xD;
"Get out of the way, then!" he replied, half way between&#xD;
a grin and a smile. "It 's enough to provoke a saint, to hear&#xD;
you defend such folly! If it were not proof that you do not&#xD;
care for him, IL should be tempted to swear!" And he flung&#xD;
himself out of the room, and, a moment after, I saw him driv-&#xD;
ing furiously down the street.&#xD;
Christmas Eve. ~- The doctor and his yife are singing&#xD;
Milton's glorious hymn of the Nativity below, and there is a&#xD;
harmony and tenderness in tluieir tones, as they reach me,&#xD;
better than all art. So have they sung together, on every&#xD;
Christmas eve, for twenty-five years. May it be long before&#xD;
God calls them to sing it on high!&#xD;
"J3essie, come help us!" calls the doctor.&#xD;
No, friends; I am passing through the Valley of IIumiia~&#xD;
tion to-night, and the Miserere Deus mei is a more fitting&#xD;
strain for me, than that song of joy. I am struggling with&#xD;
pride and weakness; and when I conquer, as by the help of&#xD;
God I surely sh~dl, I may, perchance, find that herb, "heart's-&#xD;
ease," which is said to grow. so plentifully here, and be able&#xD;
to sing with the shepherd..boy of whom Bunyan speaks:&#xD;

"lie that is down need fear no fall;&#xD;

LEAVES FROM THE TREE IODRASYL.&#xD;
Christmas Day. - Last night life seemed so mean and&#xD;
worthless, IL was so weak and selfish, that IL could not hear&#xD;
the song of the angels - could see nothing in this great uni-&#xD;
yerse, but iuy, own petty self; but this morning it is better.&#xD;
There is nothing like right, true, honest, friendly words gud&#xD;
glances to lay evil spirits! They are sometimes better than&#xD;
prayer and fasting. IL was convinced of this when I met the&#xD;
friendly greeting of the doctor and his wife this morning, ~tnd&#xD;
looked upon his radiant face. Surely, IL told him laughingly,&#xD;
in Sir John Suckling's words:&#xD;
"No sun upon an Easter day&#xD;
Was half so fine a ~icrlit ;"&#xD;
but he suggested "warming-pan" as being, at the same time,&#xD;
more "correct and professional."&#xD;
How pleasant was that small breakfast-room, - h~w deli-&#xD;
cious the coffee and the buckwheat cakes!&#xD;
"Bessie," said good Mrs. 0- , after breakfast, "we&#xD;
always let Sally go to church on Christmas day, and, as&#xD;
we shall have to hurry, we shall press you into the service.&#xD;
Will you seed these raisins?"&#xD;
IL don't know what there was about those raisins, but with&#xD;
every seed IL flung out my heart grew lighter, and IL had&#xD;
struck up an accompaniment to Mrs. ~ song, as she&#xD;
tripped back and forth between the breakfast-room and the&#xD;
kitchen, when the doctor put his head into the door witir,-&#xD;
"Well, Lydia, IL am going!"&#xD;
"Where?" she asked, scarcely interrupting her song.&#xD;
"First, to see Mr. P , then to poor Pat Smiley's."&#xD;
"IL hope you '11 find them better, poor souls! Sally, don't&#xD;
let the rice burn!" cried the good woman, as she went up to&#xD;
her husband to arrange his shirt-collar, which,, whatever may&#xD;
be the prevailing fashion, always manifests something of the&#xD;
wearer's individuality, and stands just as it has a mind to.&#xD;
"0, the deuce take the collar! "-he cried, seizing her haiid&#xD;
&#xD;
!~tIE WARY.                  89'&#xD;
and drawing his head in and out of his furs, like a turtle.&#xD;
"have you nothing to think of but rice and starch, this&#xD;
morning?"&#xD;
"0, yes, a plenty of things; puddings, and. vegetables,&#xD;
and the cranberry sauce, - IL came near forgetting that," she&#xD;
said, laughing and attempting to get free.&#xD;
But he held her tight while he said, looking down into her&#xD;
eyes, gravely:&#xD;
"There is another sauce for our Christmas dinner, wife,&#xD;
which I am afraid you have forgotten."&#xD;
"What is it?" she asked, all the housekeeper stirring in&#xD;
her at once. "IL have tomato, quince," -&#xD;
"No, no," he said, interrupting her, "IL see you have not&#xD;
got it, but if. you will take that nice baked spare-rib, on the&#xD;
second shelf in the pantry (I 'ye been in there), a few mince&#xD;
pies, and anything else that comes handy, and put them into ~&#xD;
my carriage, IL guess IL can find what we want at Pat Smiley's.&#xD;
Don't you think, wife, that the knowledge that those hungry-&#xD;
eyed, gaunt little ghouls of his (there are a dozen or so of&#xD;
them) are well fed for once in their lives, will give a better&#xD;
relish to our own dinner, than ketchup or cranberry?"&#xD;
She looked up in his face a moment, before she- fle'WF to do&#xD;
as he suggested; and that man must be worse than a hL%~ttentot&#xD;
who would not prize such a revelation higher than ~the ap.&#xD;
pause of the whole world.&#xD;
Mrs. 0- and Sally both went to church, leaving mo&#xD;
watch the baking ; and between that and writing a little to&#xD;
mother IL spent the morning.&#xD;
When IL entered the dining-room, IL found out the meaning~&#xD;
of all the whispering and plotting yesterday, for "Bubby&#xD;
Lee," looking almost as rosy and plump as before his illness,-&#xD;
ran into my arms with his "Merry Christh.math, Mith ILtton;"&#xD;
and the two widows, mother and daughter, and Mary, came&#xD;
round me, uttering the same kind wishes mingled with grate-&#xD;
ful ~ear~.&#xD;

&#xD;
They had 'all been invited t&amp;amp;'dinner, and the doctor, quite&#xD;
opportunelyfor 'my composure, ordered them all to their&#xD;
seats at the table, brandishing his carving-knife threateningly&#xD;
at Mary, who insisted on waiting on the table with $aily.&#xD;
"IL am as hungry as a bear, good people," he said, as he&#xD;
piled up their plates'with good things, "and IL heartily hope&#xD;
that you will keep me company. No, no ketchup; IL got&#xD;
enough of that sauce we spoke of this morning, to last through&#xD;
one dinner. Wife, did you know you had an angel for your&#xD;
husband?"&#xD;
"IL thought IL had a warming-pan, this morning," she said.&#xD;
"All right - there is a closer connection between warming-&#xD;
pans and ang~l~ than some people think. Take some more&#xD;
of 'this dressing, Mrs. Lee?"&#xD;
"What soft of an angel, doctor?" IL asked; "there are two&#xD;
~ kinds, you know."&#xD;
"One right from heaven, according to Pat Smiley and his&#xD;
wife; and they, being true believers, ought to know. So no&#xD;
insinuations, Miss." And he went bn to give us such a lu-&#xD;
dicrous account of the gratitude of the poor Irish family,&#xD;
xni~gled with, here and there, true touches of pathos as he&#xD;
described the condition of the helpless father, as compelled&#xD;
both oar laughter and our tears.&#xD;
~The happy faces of the Lees were good sauce for our' festi~&#xD;
val diviner, arid we ate it with happy hearts. And when, on&#xD;
rising from the table, the doctor fervently thanked God, not&#xD;
n~erely for the good things which had been set before us, but&#xD;
'that He had put it into our hearts to share the~n with others,&#xD;
IL felt the true meaning of the custom; for the mean and&#xD;
the dishonest, the wicked and. hardearted, may sit at loaded,&#xD;
tables.but God alone can put it into their hearts to share&#xD;
their goode with others.&#xD;
Catching up the little boy in his arms, he. led the way to&#xD;
the parlor, which I had found, to my surprise, close' locked, in&#xD;
the morning. He now unlocked the 4oor, threw it open, ~nd&#xD;
&#xD;
there, in the centre of the roem, stood a table 'covered with&#xD;
gifts. No Christmas tree could have supported the beautiful&#xD;
iltustrate~d copy of Shakspeare that bore my name, nor the&#xD;
heavy~arin material for winter clothing, which they had&#xD;
provided for their other guests.&#xD;
"That will keep you warm on your way to school, this&#xD;
winter," said the doctor, flinging a nice "Bay State" shawl&#xD;
over Mary's shoulders, as his wife placed in her hand a certif-&#xD;
icate of her membership in the "Webster High School," for&#xD;
the ensuing term.&#xD;
"Bessie was planning to make a dress-maker of you, Mary,"&#xD;
said the doctor; "but my wife happened to se&amp;amp;the accounts&#xD;
you keep for your mother, and thought a0lerks~hip in Mr.&#xD;
C-'s store would be much better for you,~ seeing that&#xD;
fashionable dress-makers are, with reference to their a~pre~-&#xD;
tices, very much like the horseleeches, crying, 'Give! giv~e~ P;&#xD;
without an adequate equivalent in return. IL know somethii~ig&#xD;
about this, for Lydia Mason and IL took the trouble to inquire.&#xD;
And, Bessie, next time you fcA inclined to advocate 'women's&#xD;
rights,' please bear in mind the fact, that we men do give our&#xD;
apprentices their board and a fair knowledge of their bi~ia~;&#xD;
if nothing more; while a girl is made to board hers ,t~imd&#xD;
kept sewing away at cross-stitch and back~stitch,~4' the&#xD;
Lord knows what, for a whole si~ months or a year~ and at&#xD;
the end knows no more about fitting a dress than IL do~ Atid&#xD;
if she were to stay three years, it would be just so, for whsn&#xD;
women do choose to serve the devil, they do it With abetter&#xD;
grace than we men. Is it not so, Bessie'?"&#xD;
IL was obliged to confess that IL knew more than one young&#xD;
girl, who had sewed six: months for her mistress, earning her&#xD;
fair wages, and had returned home an adept in making all&#xD;
sorts of trimmings, but without ever having been peitmitted to&#xD;
fit a common muslin dress.&#xD;
People talk of the eloquence of gratitude, but when the&#xD;
heart is full, it is still. 'Our guests found it so ; ~-~- they Ihad&#xD;

"no words" they said, and that was enough. But as they sit&#xD;
over their humble fire to-night, talking over their dinner, and&#xD;
viewing again and a gain their presents, II much doubt if the&#xD;
do not think, with Pat Smiley's wife, that the doctq~t~4 his&#xD;
wife are good as angels, or even better, - at lea~t~ better&#xD;
judges of flannels, lambs-wool stockings and shoe-leather. At,&#xD;
least, I thought so, when, with loving words and smiles, and&#xD;
some tears, they wrapped me up, buried me in furs and&#xD;
shawls~ and with Mrs. G-'s motherly kiss and blessed&#xD;
words on my brow and in my heart, the doctor placed me in&#xD;
his carriage and drove to my uncle's.&#xD;
My heart Was full, too full for words, and the sight of the&#xD;
happy faces in ,, the street, the troops of rosy children, the&#xD;
sound of the merry Christmas greetings as we drove along,&#xD;
only Aeepened my sense of the divine love which it seemed&#xD;
t penetrate every heart.&#xD;
rove at uncle's door, H- stood on the steps&#xD;
to receive us; but, as he sprang to the side of the carriage,&#xD;
the doctor put him aside, with some joke about being super-&#xD;
seded by a younger man, and, taking me in his arms, bore me&#xD;
in and placed me on the sofa.&#xD;
Th0y gathered round me with their Christmas greetings,&#xD;
and I,. like a simpleton, burst into tears. Then there was&#xD;
confusion; uncle crying out that I was fainting, aunt, Emilia,&#xD;
and 11-A-, running all ways for restoratives, while the doc-&#xD;
~tor quietly seated himself by my side, undid my wrappings,&#xD;
and whispered, "Is this really the wisest thing you can do,&#xD;
Bessie?"&#xD;
I could not help smiling at his look; and, taking a glass of&#xD;
watei' from II-, I shook off my tippets, and begged uncle's&#xD;
pardon for, being so nervous.&#xD;
Happily, uncle and aunt felt it incumbent upon them to be&#xD;
very thankful to Doctor G~-.--.-, and say a great deal of their&#xD;
obligations.&#xD;
"Obligations!" said the latter, 1au~hing; "ask my wife&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DIAI3Y.&#xD;
&#xD;
about that. Why, 't was only yesterday she convincedd me&#xD;
that we could give more in Christmas charities ~this year than&#xD;
ever, bee~use God had blessed us with the love of this girl&#xD;
here. ~ ~My wife has a curious way Qf seeing things; but&#xD;
H-~- here looks as if he understood all about it."&#xD;
if 11- did, uncle and aunt did not; but uncle said he&#xD;
was infinitely obliged to Mrs. G- for her good opinion of N-'&#xD;
his niece, and aunt always knew her "to be a very kind-&#xD;
hearted woman;" snd so the doctor took his leave. -&#xD;
Sophie came in to welcome me back; and certainly. her&#xD;
yellow face was not the least pleasant thing that met my&#xD;
sight.&#xD;
But they were all in excellent spirits; uncle unbent him-&#xD;
self so far as to laugh at some of the pointed sallies flying&#xD;
between 11-. and Emilia, and aunt seemed for once in e&#xD;
world quite forgetful of household cares. Tir~ed ai~dweak~, IW.&#xD;
sat and watched them, and thought how hand~soine they Wei~~&#xD;
all four, - and could understand something how a man oi~'&#xD;
uncle's mental calibre must feel towards one as plain-looking&#xD;
as "my niece." Emilia and H- are both' worthy of their&#xD;
race. I could not help whispering some of these thoughts 'to&#xD;
aunt, who opened her eyes, and answered:&#xD;
"Ay, just so; Ernilia, though, is more of a Cranston ~than&#xD;
an 11-. The Cranstons are a fine-looking family. lint&#xD;
what are you saying, child? You are not 'so very plaiIi~-&#xD;
not ugly, you know. Indeed, now, I think this illness has&#xD;
improved you. You have lost that well, that fulness of.&#xD;
the chest and shoulders, that country look, as I call it. With&#xD;
a little attention to dress, your figure will be quite. slende~~&#xD;
to what it was before. By the by, do you know 11- ad-&#xD;
mires your figure? He says it i~ just the style which one sees&#xD;
in the paintings of the old masters. We had quite a discus..&#xD;
sion about it the other day, and he half convinced me that he&#xD;
was right."&#xD;
As he always does, I mentallyy added, while I prayed that&#xD;

H- might not take it into his head to make me the chief&#xD;
figure in his domestic pictures.&#xD;
But this prayer was needless, my uncle, my mother's own&#xD;
brother, has saved me any further trouble on this sc~*~ My&#xD;
face even now burns with shame, when IL think of the mean,&#xD;
parsimonious character they must think me'; and IL would fain&#xD;
have had their esteem.&#xD;
0, did they know what it is to be in debt! to be obliged&#xD;
to calculate every little expense, or leave my mother shelter-&#xD;
less! Could IL make up my mind to explain all this go into&#xD;
the details; but, no, IL will not do it; IL should be but a&#xD;
beggar in their eyes -just what IL seem now. IL will go&#xD;
home - I will go into my school again, and ile who "tempers&#xD;
the wind to the shorn lamb" wift care for us!&#xD;
But let me look at this thing as it is. One day, before IL&#xD;
went to Mrs. Lee's, at aunt's request IL accompanied her to a&#xD;
jeweller's store. She made some trifling 'purchase, and then&#xD;
asked Eo look ~at some sets of pearl ornaments, arranged in a&#xD;
new style, ~which they had advertised. She asked my opinion&#xD;
of them, and also of some elegant silver' card-cases, and IL said&#xD;
they were "very beautiful."&#xD;
"Lizzie Olinstead has just bought a set. Would not you&#xD;
like one, Elizabeth? They would be just the thing for you,"&#xD;
she said.&#xD;
The sight of all these rich and beautiful things had brought&#xD;
very vividly to my mind the thought of our poverty, and IL&#xD;
answered hastily,&#xD;
"No, aunt; f would much rather have the money they&#xD;
would cost."&#xD;
I had forgotten all about it, when, just as IL was getting to&#xD;
feel ~t home among them to-night, uncle placed before Miss&#xD;
Cranston a box containing one of those identical. sets of pearls,&#xD;
and a beautifully chased card-case, as Christmas gifts from&#xD;
himself and aunt; then, turning to me, put into my hand a&#xD;
bank-note, saying, in his' e&amp;amp;tdest, drye~t tone,&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DIABY,&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;

I&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"It was the intention of your aunt affd n~yse1f" to give, you&#xD;
a set of ornaments and a case like Miss~Cranston's, Elizabetj~;&#xD;
but, understanding that you value ready money higher than&#xD;
such tok~is of affection, you have the equivalent there."&#xD;
IL did not see H-.-----'s look of wonder or Miss Cranston's&#xD;
stare. IL only felt them, while IL saw my father laboring with&#xD;
his pen, with the death-mark on his brow, that my mother&#xD;
need not ask aid of these who had spurned her for his sake.&#xD;
IL heard only his low whisper, as he drew my little arms&#xD;
around his neck, the morning he died, and, With great, bright&#xD;
eyes looking into mine, whispered between his fits of cough~ ' -&#xD;
ing:&#xD;
"Take good care of your mother, my little J3essie; she will&#xD;
have no one but you now."&#xD;
This memory, and the consciousness that I had fulfilled my ~&#xD;
father's command, kept me on my feet now, weak as IL was,&#xD;
though IL dared not trust myself to speak, bQt ~d motion~&#xD;
~ in my outstretched hand~ ~4~i to~Ward~&#xD;
"Is there any mistake, child? Tha 12i&amp;amp;a good one,"&#xD;
he said, in that same hard tone.&#xD;
IL could bear it no longer. Dropping the bill on the table,&#xD;
IL burst into tears, and fled to my room. What must they&#xD;
think of me? Why should IL care? 0, is this cold, proud,.&#xD;

IL can bear it. But I will go home.&#xD;
There, that is aunt's step coming on the stairs! Now no,&#xD;
more tears.&#xD;
Dec. 26th. It was aunt, and? to my great $urprise~ BEG&#xD;
was followed by uncle, both anxious to know if I was ill, if&#xD;
IL felt any return of my fever, that I behaved so strangely.&#xD;
IL felt more than ever, as IL listened to their inquiries, that&#xD;
I could not explain, so IL merely 0aLd that aunt had misunder..&#xD;

stood the meaning of my remark in Mr. R-.--'s store; that&#xD;
I had forgotten all about it, and therefore was surprised at&#xD;
being charged with the meanness of hoarding money for&#xD;
itself.&#xD;
Uncle interrupted - me by saying that he was very glad to&#xD;
find he was mistaken; that it seemed strange that one so&#xD;
young should be tainted by so low a vice, especially a lady,&#xD;
but from the knowledge he had of my family on my father's&#xD;
side - I rose to my feet at' once, and, with a firmness and a&#xD;
pride which I was scarcely conscious of possessing before, in-&#xD;
terrupted him:&#xD;
"Allow me to remind you, sir, that, under your own roof,&#xD;
the name of a guest's father should be sacred. That is one&#xD;
of the lessons my own father taught me as a child; and you&#xD;
wrong him, you- wrong my mother, - yonr own sister, sir, -&#xD;
I went on, my woman's nature getting the better of my calm-&#xD;
ness, -" when you presume to hint that~he sought her from&#xD;
uierce~iary motives. 0, you did not know him, or you would&#xD;
never dream of such a thing!"&#xD;
Uncle gazed at me a moment between surprise and indig~&#xD;
nation. I think the former predominated, for the remark&#xD;
that he made, as soon as he gained breath, indicated that he&#xD;
did not dream that any one in his senses could talk thus to&#xD;
a SewaL It was this, and addressed to aunt:&#xD;
"It must be- that Elizabeth is light-headed still. Had we&#xD;
not better send for iDr. G-.---?"&#xD;
Aunt's woman's nature gave her an inkling of the truth.&#xD;
She said I was weak and tired out, and rather hysterical;&#xD;
that she would sit with me awhile, while he went down.&#xD;
Then - Heaven help the well-meaning but simple-minded&#xD;
soul! she went on trying to explain to me the mistake,&#xD;
and, in so doing, repeated the remarks my conduct had' elic-&#xD;
ited down stairs; how grave H- had '-looked, and h~w&#xD;
Miss Cranston had said she would not have believed it. ~&#xD;

Emilia had not thought it so strange, for she "supposed poor&#xD;
people, who are obliged to count every cent they 8pend, rnu~5t&#xD;
naturally think a great deal of money."&#xD;
0, what a Job's comforter was this aunt of mine, with her&#xD;
lack of tact and heart-knowledge! Sitting there, in her&#xD;
,rich silk dress, with her exquisite cap and faultless laces, she&#xD;
brought to my thought another figure. Which looked best iii&#xD;
the eyes of the angels, I cannot say, but I know which most&#xD;
comforted my sore and weary heart. It was the figure of our&#xD;
kind neighbor, Mrs. F , coming across the fields, with hOr&#xD;
yellow flannel blanket on her shoulders, and a spotted muslin&#xD;
cap, with wide, crimped borders, shading her face, to see if&#xD;
mother was quite well if she would need any little thing&#xD;
done for her, which her boys, Bill or John, could do, while I&#xD;
was busy in my school - always saying some strong, hopeful,&#xD;
cheering word. That yellow flannel blanket covers a noble&#xD;
heart.' Would that I could rest my head ~against it this&#xD;
moment aiid hear her "Never mind, child, there are '1rier~&#xD;
enough in one's path at times, I know, but they will all be&#xD;
cleared away at last!"&#xD;
New-Year's Day, 1852. - All goes on here the same as&#xD;
before that scene on Christmas evening, save that uncle's&#xD;
manners have been a little more frigid and. sta~tely t4ian&#xD;
usual. Miss Cranston evidently considers me as one whom&#xD;
she can patronize. She has shown me all her dresses and&#xD;
jewelry, and given me a history of all her flirtations and&#xD;
friendships; in short, I am in a fair way to be installed as&#xD;
confidant to a beautiful belle - not. to say coquette~ A.&#xD;
strange position for one like me. '&#xD;

most mao~nificent bouqu~6t of pansies, saying something about&#xD;
my great love of flowers. I was touched by this proof of his&#xD;
delicacy, and was not ashamed to let him see it. He never&#xD;
seemed more worthy of being beloved than at tha~t moment.&#xD;
There have been several parties, the past week, which I have&#xD;
been obliged to~ enjoy second-hand from the piquant descrip-&#xD;
tions of Miss Cranston and H-.. I have plead ill-health&#xD;
for not attending, and the excuse has been accepted. Indeed;&#xD;
I am not strong, and so to-day I am permitted to keep my&#xD;
room, while Emilia, after the New York custom, receives&#xD;
calls. She flits back and forth, between the parlors and my&#xD;
room, like a beautiful bird, to report her calls. Just now she&#xD;
came in to tell me she had received a call from H-,&#xD;
and begged me to guess who was with him.&#xD;
"How should I know, dear?" I said, smiling at her&#xD;
eagerness. "Your impatience would never wait until I had&#xD;
done guessing."&#xD;
"How stupid! Why, it was Mr. T-, the young&#xD;
lawyer, whom they are all talking about."&#xD;
"Mr. T-..; I thought he was in New York."&#xD;
"0, he 's on his way to Boston, and so calLed' to see me.&#xD;
0, I wish the P--s and Y--s knew it!"&#xD;
"Why?"&#xD;
"0, because it would vex them so. They are dying to get&#xD;
him to visit at their houses.&#xD;
"But what is there peculiar about the man?"&#xD;
"0, ~nough. He never compliments, or, at least, very&#xD;
rarely. And then he says such queer things, -just what he&#xD;
thin~w 6f you. For instance, I was playing one day when he&#xD;
called at our house, and, at his request, kept on. I played&#xD;
brilliantly;' and when I had finished, instead of professing&#xD;
himself' delighted.' ' harmed,' and all that, he never said a&#xD;
word, only gave me a simple bow. Determined to make him&#xD;
speak, I asked him~ laughingly, if Lhe piece was not well ex...&#xD;
ecute4? What do you think he said? Why,,~' No; not for&#xD;
&#xD;
one with my superior talent for music and opportunities foi.~&#xD;
practice.' Did you ever heat anything so odd? And yet;f~&#xD;
the life of me, I could n't be angry. By the by," she added,&#xD;
putting her head back through the door, as she flitted out,&#xD;
"he said he had m'A you here, and made due inquiries. I&#xD;
referred him to H-, as being the best qualified to answer,&#xD;
having driven you out this morning."&#xD;
"They say he is to marry Mrs. N-, of your city," I&#xD;
said.&#xD;
"Not if I can get him myself;" and away she flew. Well,~&#xD;
well, what is it to me?&#xD;
Jan. 8th.-" But our house is so much warmer and more&#xD;
comfortable than even the best of country houses; so much&#xD;
better for you, in your state of health, that you will not&#xD;
think of going home until spring, child; certainly~not, now&#xD;
that your mother has written advising you to stay."&#xD;
Aunt and I were discussing a letter which I received from&#xD;
mother yesterday, in which, anxious for my health, she had&#xD;
advised me to remain in the city until the spring; and aunt;&#xD;
as above, warmly seconded her wish.&#xD;
I suppose I shall have to remain a while longer, at lcast,&#xD;
or deeply offend these good people; but "warmth and com-&#xD;
fort ! "- there is more warmth and comfort in my mother's&#xD;
eyes than in all the anthracite ever discovered.&#xD;
fan. 9th. -I remember having seen somewhere a "diary"&#xD;
of Peggy Dow, consort of the celebrated Iiorenzo Dow, in&#xD;
which divers events were put down under the 'head ofi ~cRe~&#xD;
markable Experiences." I think the affair of this morning&#xD;
must come under that head. Some half 4ozen times since I&#xD;
came here I have met uncle's partnerNIr. A-.--~-.--, a tall;&#xD;
lean, bald-head~d man, witha complexion like an old bank&#xD;
note, all wrinkled and yellr~w. lie ha&amp;amp;a way of talking in*&#xD;
monosyllables, as if a niggar&amp;amp;~f his breath. He has never&#xD;

priced this morning, when uncle sent for me to his room and&#xD;
told i~e, in his most polite tones, that this ~{r. A-.~- had&#xD;
made me an offer of his hand and fortune; he did not say&#xD;
heart, and it was well he did not, for I should have laughed&#xD;
in his face. However, IL kept a grave face, while he conde-&#xD;
scended to point out to' me the advantages which would result,&#xD;
both to my mother and myself, from the match. He laid&#xD;
great stress on our present straitened condition, and the "low*&#xD;
Vulgar people" with whom it necessarily forced us to come in&#xD;
contact, if~ not to associate mymother's declining health;&#xD;
in short, he took me up to the pinnacle of the modern tem-&#xD;
ple of wealth and position, and showed me all the goodly&#xD;
things that might be mine if I would sell~ myself to this&#xD;
respectable piece of old parchment, Mr. A-; and then&#xD;
very politely saying, with a look at my face and figure, that&#xD;
a woman in my position could hardly hope to do better, left&#xD;
it for me to decide.&#xD;
I very decidedly, bat very briefly, declined the honor, say-&#xD;
ing that he ought to know that considerations of wealth had&#xD;
little influence with one of my father's family.&#xD;
lie stared at m~ a moment, then coolly bowed me Out of&#xD;
his room, as he would one of his business clerks. But I see&#xD;
he is decidedly angry, else I should be inclined to laugh at&#xD;
the whole affair.&#xD;
Jan. 10th. - I must ride no more with H-.---. It is evi-&#xD;
dent that he loves me, and I will spa~'e himself and me the&#xD;
pain of an eclaircissemei&amp;amp;t, if possible. This Queen Yashti&#xD;
air will not answer much longer; but, 'thank Heav~en, I shall&#xD;
soon. go home! It is the most convincing proof Qf the truth&#xD;
of my suspicions, that he thus defers to my will,' he, the&#xD;
accomplished man of the world. And yet, this very trait&#xD;
renders him unfit to be my husband. He whom I call by that&#xD;
name must be guided by no one but God and his own' con-&#xD;
victions.&#xD;
Jan. 15th. They have been spoken- those words which&#xD;
&#xD;
I so dreaded to hear; and) 0, "Heaven! what am 1, that~ I&#xD;
should inflid ~u~li pahi and suffering upon any human soul?&#xD;
Never did h&amp;amp; seera s~ truly good and noble as when, putting&#xD;
aside all - heartily con~iiderations, he plead in trembling tones&#xD;
for my love, for lif~s test boon from my hands!&#xD;
And ye1~ never did I feel it more impossible to grant his&#xD;
prayer. God' knows I would have done so, if I could; I&#xD;
would have put away my long-chei~ished dreams as idle, had&#xD;
I found any response to his words. IL even plead for him; I&#xD;
set before me all his goodness and nobleness, his growing&#xD;
sympathy with my tastes and pursuits, -the wide influence for&#xD;
good which, he urged, I possessed over him. I thought of&#xD;
my mother - of the life of toil and isolation that lay before&#xD;
me; but there came no response, and I dare not trifle with&#xD;
eternal truth.&#xD;
He plead for hope, and urged the love which is the meed&#xD;
of years of tenderess and devotion. It cannot be. I have&#xD;
been down into the innermost recesses of my heart, and I&#xD;
know, by the love that went out so spontaneously toward&#xD;
another, that there are abysses of tenderness - ay, passion&#xD;
there, that H-.----. has no power to move; and, knowing this,&#xD;
I dare not trust to years.&#xD;
So I let him look into my heart,.-~ God gave me strength to&#xD;
do it,- and, with an incoherent blessing on me for my truth,&#xD;
he went out 'into the storm ~nd darkness; but the ~wintry&#xD;
sleet, nor the north wind, nor ~the darkness, is not more cold&#xD;
and dreary, than the heart he has left behind! 0, they&#xD;
know not woman's heart who t4k of the pride of conquest!&#xD;
There is nothing on God's earth that teaches humility, like&#xD;
the consciousness of heing deeply and truly beloved!&#xD;
Jan. 16th. - Kept my room all day, feeling sad, weak,&#xD;
miserable. There was '" a. lion~ in the way," let me turn&#xD;
in any direction. Aunt came up, good and prosy and practi-&#xD;

4        have drawn back my faith and hope -.niy ~courage and&#xD;
strength. I heard Emilia below chatting to some yoting&#xD;
friends, for she has already become a favorite in society, and.&#xD;
I sat and pitied myself, a plain, poor, ungifted soul, until I&#xD;
suddenly thought of Milton's noble line:&#xD;
"Those serve who only stand and w&amp;amp;tt;"&#xD;
and it brought aid and comfort. What cowards we are!&#xD;
Jan. 18th. They say H-.---- has gone to New York, en&#xD;
route for Europe! Doctor G-. was sitting with us when&#xD;
Ernilia came in, having just heard the news up town. Sud-&#xD;
denly, interrupting herself in her exclamations of surprise,&#xD;
aunt turned to me: "You said II- called here the even-&#xD;
ing we went to hear Holmes' lecture. Did he say nothing of&#xD;
this, Elizabeth?"&#xD;
"No, certainly not, aunt;" and joy that I was thus able&#xD;
to speak the truth gave me courage to~oldly face Doctor&#xD;
G-.---'s searching look.&#xD;
But I was glad that uncle came in that moment, and created&#xD;
a diversion in my favor. He never sees mystery in anything&#xD;
that cannot be solved by the interest table, and thought. H.-.&#xD;
gone to Europe on business. "Stock~ are rising, and he has&#xD;
some interest there, I believe," he said.&#xD;
"'Stocks, uncle!~' said Emilia, impatiently. "When did&#xD;
Fred. ll-~----- ever trouble himself about stocks, I should like&#xD;
to know?"&#xD;
"I 'in really afraid it 's an attack of brain fever," began&#xD;
aunt, despondingly. "His fatiler died of it, and he has been&#xD;
threatened with it more than once. Don't you think so, doc-&#xD;
tor?" she asked, anxiously.&#xD;
"Not at all, my dear madam. Not that a young fellow's&#xD;
brain - ay, and blood, too ~' does not get' into a strange sort&#xD;
of whirl ~~once in a while, but from other causes than conges-&#xD;
4, tion." And again he scanned my face closely.&#xD;
Aunt si~h'ed, and uncle spent a whole twenty minutes, a&#xD;
&#xD;
K4'&#xD;
&#xD;
long time for him, in trying to prove to her the impossibility&#xD;
of there being any he~editar~y taint in the blood of her fami-&#xD;
ly - a family related to him.&#xD;
According to "him,~a1l his own relatives have died through&#xD;
some oversight which might have been seen and provided for,&#xD;
had they been endowed with hig wisdom. I presume he ex-&#xD;
pects to be translated.&#xD;
Jan. 20th. - Emilia takes H-.'s absence to heart.&#xD;
What does it mean? Underneath that war of words, which&#xD;
sometimes bordered on sarcasm, between them, did there lurk&#xD;
a deeper feeling? I must look to this. She is in high spirits&#xD;
to-night, though, because Mr. E-.---, who lectured before ~he&#xD;
"Institute" last night, is to dine here to-morrow. She proph-&#xD;
esies I will fall in love with him at once. Perhaps so; I&#xD;
shall see.&#xD;
J~irn. 21st. - He has been here - the author, poet, prophet,&#xD;
whom I have reverenced for years. I have looked~ upoti his&#xD;
face, listened to his voice, and it is much to say that he did&#xD;
not disappoint me. 'The face is good', grave, and serene; but&#xD;
his chief power lies in his voice and manner, which grows on&#xD;
one until it becomes a complete fascination.&#xD;
At least, so~ I thought, when he turned from the mixed&#xD;
company, after dinner, and began to talk to me of Browning's&#xD;
poems, which lay upon the table. Perhaps I was prepossessed&#xD;
by the interest with which he listened to my remarks, but&#xD;
every word seemed the echo of a loving heart, an' earnest soul,&#xD;
and a subtle intellect; subtle. and beautiful, rather than&#xD;
deep or strong - passionless and calm as a Greek statue. He&#xD;
is a, wonderful man, and- yet I could feel rather than see his&#xD;
limitations; and, though he talked so eloquently of" Hakeein&#xD;
in the Return of the Druses," he could never be a "Hakeem"&#xD;
for 'me- scarcely a "Djabal." And yet, verily', there are&#xD;
moods when it seems~ an exceedingly pleasa~it sin t~ ~ll down&#xD;
and worship false gods!&#xD;

demoniacal influence pervades our atmosphere, and everything&#xD;
goes wrong. Emiia is capricious as the wind; aunt is haunted&#xD;
by a legion of household evils, which, like John Barleycorn,&#xD;
"rise up again" as soon as IL think IL have laid them; and IL&#xD;
get out of patience, and pray earnestly that IL may never be a.&#xD;
poor-rich woman.&#xD;
IL have seen Mrs. N-.--. She is visiting at her uncle,&#xD;
Judge A-'s, and was at the concert to-night - a beautiful&#xD;
woman, of right queenly presence.&#xD;
Evening of Jan. 22d.- Eureka! Etnilia loves II-! IL&#xD;
went to her room to-day, and found her in a violent passion.&#xD;
Bridget, the chambermaid~ aunt's new "Bridge of Sighs," in&#xD;
dusting Emily's room, had thrown down a paper-weight rep-&#xD;
resenting Psyche asleep, and broken it into a dozen pieces.&#xD;
IL had often admired the beautiful little gem, and could have&#xD;
wept when IL saw it in fragments; but IL was surprised at&#xD;
Emilia's flashing eyes and bitter reproaches. As soon as she&#xD;
saw me she burst into tears, and exclaimed,&#xD;
"IL can't help it! See there, Elizabeth!"&#xD;
The frightened Irish girl t~ok the opportunity to escape,&#xD;
while IL sat down to try to comfort Emilia with a vision of all&#xD;
the pretty paper-weights to be had at Kilby &amp;amp; Brown's~ and&#xD;
proved on about the folly of vexing herself thus for a trjfTh.&#xD;
She raised her head, for she had been leaning on my&#xD;
shoulder, - and said, petulantly, shaking back her long curls,&#xD;
"Tr~/Zes! That is all you know about it, Miss Lytton."&#xD;
Then, blushing at her rudeness, she said, "Pardon me, Eliz-&#xD;
abeth, IL am really ashamed of myself; but that Psyche was&#xD;
a gift to me, some three years since, from a friend, and IL prized&#xD;
it very much, very much, indeed, for its associations. But&#xD;
it is as well thus," she added, with a singular expression of&#xD;
haughty scorn.&#xD;
So it was the gift of a friend, -~ a lover, IL mused, as IL&#xD;
went down stairs; and I was fast weaving out, as is my 'wont,&#xD;
a web of ~romanee, when IL was roused by aunt's voice, asking,&#xD;
&#xD;
"What has that Bridget done, now ?"&#xD;
"Broken Emilia's Psyche!"&#xD;
" What, poor ~ gift?"&#xD;
So, so, IL thought; "poor H-" (every one is always&#xD;
"poor" with Aunt Sewal when absent from her) is that&#xD;
"friend." Now for the nature of~ those cherished associations.&#xD;
Aunt has not a grain of secretiveness, and one or two leading&#xD;
questions drew from her all IL wanted to know.&#xD;
Before ll- went to Europe, he had been quite devoted&#xD;
to his cousin. The faniilies began to look upon their union,&#xD;
at some future time, as quite possible; but just before he left&#xD;
they had quarrelled, and, since his return, though perfectly&#xD;
polite to each other, they have manifested no desire to resume&#xD;
their former relations. Aunt conld not say as she was&#xD;
"sorry, she loved them both as her own children, but they&#xD;
might as well choose somewhere else. She had seen quite&#xD;
enough of marrying cousins in Jane Welmot's case." Some-&#xD;
thing tells me that it will be well with these young friends&#xD;
yet. IL rejoice!&#xD;
Jan. 23d. - A letter to-day from our kind neighbor, Mrs.&#xD;
F-. She says mother has changed very strangely within&#xD;
a week; thinks she has had a slight attack of paralysis, and&#xD;
advises me to come home. I have announced my determina-&#xD;
tion to start to-morrow; but uncle and aunt talk of delay, Qf&#xD;
"next week," of the necessity of being "calm," and all that.&#xD;
They forget that my mother is all IL have on earth.&#xD;
IL have agreed to stay until day after to-morrow, when un-&#xD;
cle will go with me as far as New Haven, on his ~way to New&#xD;
York. 0, mother, mother!&#xD;
Jan. 24th. - I have been to bid good-by to the Lees. I&#xD;
fear IL envied them, they were so happy. Nary is at school,&#xD;
thanks to the noiseless kindness of dear' Mrs. n-, and the&#xD;
mother and sister showed me her first prokl~a in algebra&#xD;

for those bits of paper, for he snatched at one of them, and&#xD;
tore it ~idly, in his resentment at my considering them more&#xD;
worthy of attention than himself. And, after all, were there&#xD;
not in that little chubby being problems of far greater impor-&#xD;

those of Newton and La Place are but trifles, save as they&#xD;

From the widow's U went to iDr. G--------'s. The doctor was&#xD;
fortunately at home, looking over a ponderous "ledger," or&#xD;
"day-book," and humming his favorite song, "A man 's a&#xD;
man for a' that."&#xD;
"True," IL cried, as II* entered softly, and stole up behind&#xD;
him; "and, save in the person of the writer of those words,&#xD;
never stood text and proof in such close relation, doctor."&#xD;
"How now, you thief! What business have you to be&#xD;
stealing into a man's house after this fashion? But sit down&#xD;
there, while I go hunt up Lydia Mason; she 's been looking&#xD;
for you these two days."&#xD;
"You may save yourself that trouble, for, if IL mistake&#xD;
not, I saw her go into the house of your neighbor, Mrs.&#xD;
as I turned the corner. So prepare yourself to play&#xD;
the agreeable."&#xD;
"The LoiA help us, then!" he cried, with a ludicrous ex-&#xD;
pression of resignation. "I had rather face a case of ship-&#xD;
fever, than a fashionable young lady!"&#xD;
"And pray what entitles me to that distinction?"&#xD;
"look at yourself and answer. Who but fools, which&#xD;
is but good Saxon for the whole class, - would put velvet and&#xD;
furs enough about their shoulders to rig out the Grand Lama,&#xD;
and. leave their feet bare?" and he gave a glance of wither-&#xD;
ing contempt at my beautiful, new g4ters.&#xD;
"But these are cork soles, and"&#xD;
"The devil take the cork soles in such weather as this, fit&#xD;
&#xD;
only to buoy up witches! Where were your common' sense&#xD;
and rubbers when you started?"&#xD;
"One minus, and the other plus," I said,~' laughing. 'KU&#xD;
did not think the pavement damp, and my rubbers are so&#xD;
Jarge "-&#xD;
"That they make your feet look larger. Well, you are&#xD;
pretty well off in that line," he went on, grimacing; "but&#xD;
what in Heaven's' name do you suppose a sensible man cares&#xD;
about how large a woman's foot is, provided it be not de-&#xD;
formed, and she has brains enough in her skull to balance it?"&#xD;
And so he scolded an~1 joked till Mrs. G- came, and we&#xD;
had a long talk of my future.&#xD;
Why is it that I can speak to these people of things upon&#xD;
which my lips are sealed to those of my own blood? Blood!&#xD;
those alone are of our blood who understand us, who help us&#xD;
on the ways of life! God bless ye, true friends! The cur-&#xD;
rents of life are driving us far apart, but my way cannot be&#xD;
wholly dark while I keep the memory of your love!&#xD;
Passing through Pearl-street, on my way home, I came&#xD;
suddenly upon my old playmate and schoolmate, James B--.-----.&#xD;
He would have avoided me if he could, but I saw his intea-&#xD;
tion and defeated it. He took my outstretched hand, and&#xD;
answered my greeting without raising his eyes. Alas! then,&#xD;
the rumors of his "bad way" are true. The pale face, lustre-&#xD;
less eyes, nerveless figure and shambling step, were proof&#xD;
enough.&#xD;
He seemed to wish to pass 'on, but I would not be put off.&#xD;
I spoke of old times, - of Annie, his sister, long since among&#xD;
the angels; of his father, mother. Had he seen them of&#xD;
late? No; he had not been in ID-.--- for more than a year.&#xD;
Indeed! Would he not promise to meet me there, week after&#xD;
next, say on Thursday? I intended 'paying 'his father and&#xD;
mother a visit as soon~' as I got home, and should need him&#xD;
there to bring up the "IRoibury russets,'~ as of old. Would n't&#xD;
he promise?&#xD;

lie muttered something of engagements; but I urged my&#xD;
point until he promised.&#xD;
Will he keep his word? I trust so. He has been the&#xD;
Victim of evil influences, but He who gave back without&#xD;
Nain's gates that only son to his mother, is mighty still.&#xD;
Jan. 26th. -0, it is sad, terrible, to come to one's home,&#xD;
and~be welcomed, not by the firm, hard clasp, the dear, loving&#xD;
glances, the warm words of yore, but by trembling hands, a&#xD;
shaking head, and the thick, troubled speech, that indicate&#xD;
the, presence of death in life. Mother, mother! How shall&#xD;
I bear this?&#xD;
Now I must find some words that will soften this hard-&#xD;
hearted creditor, Mr. J-.---. Yesterday, when I met him,&#xD;
the memory of all his villany, - the years when, as lessee of&#xD;
these few acres, he fleeced us gradually, the hypocrite! until&#xD;
by one bold manoeuvre he claimed all, - rose up before me,&#xD;
and choked me. 0, mother, would that I had been older&#xD;
then, or you wi~er! But your wisdom was never of this&#xD;
earth. Now I will go down on my knees to him, to keep a&#xD;
shelter above your head for the little time that is left you.&#xD;
He must be human, - he cannot be more greedy than death!&#xD;
Shall IL try uncle again? No, I can work, not beg. I&#xD;
told him all I could of this, as we came down yesterday, and&#xD;
got for an answer, "Mortgages are ugly things; best get rid&#xD;
of it. Your mother never 'had any business tact. Better let&#xD;
the place go; I advised it years ago."&#xD;
Sell the place! It might have been done, and wisely,&#xD;
perhaps, some months ago. But now, when you cling to it&#xD;
so childishly, mother - no!&#xD;
Jan. 30th. -"' Cast thy bread upon the waters, for thou&#xD;
shalt find it after many days.' You and yours helped me&#xD;
years ago, my child, and now it is my turn;" and, with these&#xD;
words, kind old Widow Dean has installed herself as my&#xD;
mother's nurse. Ay, and I "reap also where IL never scat-&#xD;
tered;" for there are bread, and ham, and cakes, and pies,&#xD;
&#xD;
sent in by kind and thoughtful hearts, and the miracle of the&#xD;
widow's cruse seems like to be repeated. God reward&#xD;
'7     them!&#xD;
Feb. 8th. - To-morrow is the day of my appointment with&#xD;
James 13-. I regret that I cannot keep it; but it can-&#xD;
not b~. II will write and tell him why.&#xD;
Feb. 10th. - IL did go; for when, to please mother, I&#xD;
explained to whom I was writing, and why, two days ago,&#xD;
she insisted on my going; and when Ii refused fell a weeping,&#xD;
like a petulant child, and complained to Mrs. T-, who&#xD;
happened to come in, tViat I was undutiful and ungrateful.&#xD;
0, mother, mother, not even death could fall heavier on my&#xD;
heart than these poor, seusbless words and tears!&#xD;
Mrs. T-. advised me to go, saying that it was wisest to&#xD;
keep her quiet, - that she would come in and help Mrs.&#xD;
Dean, if needed. "And you can take old Starface," added&#xD;
the kind neighbor; "he has not done anything in a week, for&#xD;
father 's laid up with the rheumatic, and the boys user the colt.&#xD;
He is a little stiff at first, like us old folks; but get him&#xD;
started, and he '11 take you over there like a bird. You.&#xD;
have n't forgot how to drive, IL ~s'pose?"&#xD;
I accepted the offer, and at sunset was sitting between old&#xD;
Farmer B- and his wife, talking of old things and new,&#xD;
life and death, and the things which lie beyond; for, as the&#xD;
old man's eyes have darkened (he has been blind for more&#xD;
than a year, he tells n~e), he has come to see more and more&#xD;
with the eye of the spirit, which discerneth all things. They&#xD;
said little of James, though I knew he was ever in their&#xD;
thoughts; and I did not tell them of his promise, fearing to&#xD;
raise hopes which might be disappointed. But they told me&#xD;
of their troubles; of the farm, -how it was~ fast running&#xD;
down, - buildings and fences going to decay for want of an&#xD;
efficient master; and thus the hours ran on till the tall old&#xD;
clock struck nine. I still talked on, u~itil another hour&#xD;
slipped away, and then, sad ai~d di~appoint~d, took the tall)&#xD;

glittering brass candlestick which had been waiting for me&#xD;
the last hour on the stand. There came a knock at the door,&#xD;
and, begging the old lady to let me go, IL hurried into the&#xD;
little entry, shutting the door behind me. It was, indeed,&#xD;
James.&#xD;
When he saw me, his face lighted up, and, taking my&#xD;
hand, he said:&#xD;
"So you did indeed trust me, Elizabeth!"&#xD;
"Yes, indeed. Why not?"&#xD;
"Why not!" in a tone of mingled bitterness and surprise;&#xD;
"do you not know what I am, a drunkard, a bankrupt, an&#xD;
outcast, a curse to myself and others?"&#xD;
"The question is not what you are, but what you can be,&#xD;
James. You are a man, still, for you have kept your word&#xD;
with me."&#xD;
"Perhaps so; but who will believe it?" he said, bitterly.&#xD;
"I do. There are those in the next room who believe it.&#xD;
Can you doubt that? And there is One above, James, -lie&#xD;
who seeth not as man seeth, He believes it. 0, beware&#xD;
how you charge upon others the sin of your own unbelief!"&#xD;
I was excited and nervous, and burst into tears, as IL drew&#xD;
him into the next room. I know not well what followed; I&#xD;
heard only the mother's low weeping, and the blind father's&#xD;
broken voice, as he gave thanks for "this my son, which was&#xD;
lost, and is found!"&#xD;
Again we gathered round the fire; we did not speak of&#xD;
the past, but the russets were brought up, and we talked&#xD;
over the condition of the farm, - every field of which was"&#xD;
almost as familiar to me as to James, - the comparative&#xD;
qualities of the" Hudson meadow." and the "clover piece,"&#xD;
for spring wheat, the amount of available rail timber in the&#xD;
"over-yonder" woods, and, before I slept, we had run a new&#xD;
fence around the "Juniper lot," and James had rooted out&#xD;
their spreading branches. May he as easily root up his evil~&#xD;
habits! But that can hardly be; yet, when I left this morn~&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
ing, as he placed the reins in my hands, he said, earnestly,&#xD;
"You have treated me as a man, - spoken to me as one,&#xD;
Elizabeth, and you shall see that IL will be one." - Ay, with&#xD;
God's help, James.&#xD;
Fee'. 26th. - Another stroke of paralysis, and now my&#xD;
mother knows me no more, - perhaps no more on earth. I&#xD;
heard Mrs. F- calling to her daughter Mary, a moment&#xD;
ago. My mother will never call me again, never utter my&#xD;
name. This is tasting the bitterness of death!&#xD;
Feb. 28th. A letter froffi Emilia Cranston. How strange&#xD;
and unreal sound her gay words of "balls, and parties, and&#xD;
conquests !" 'One thing gives me pleasure, as much as this&#xD;

only to Cuba, and is now in New York.&#xD;
March 20th. - All is over! My mother, my 'all, lies&#xD;
pulseless and rigid in the room below. I have sat by her&#xD;
for hours in a kind of dull stupidity, scarcely recognizing&#xD;
anything, feeling anything; but this leaden sense of loss.&#xD;
When will the end come?&#xD;
March 2lst.-Last night IL slept, -for the first time in&#xD;
four nights, - a heavy, dreadful, troubled sleep, - a coun-&#xD;
terpart of the day. Then I rose and went down to the white&#xD;
form, lying so still there beneath the white sheet,- that which&#xD;
was my mother, and yet was not; and for the first time the&#xD;
tears sprang forth - tears for myself, not her. IL coul&amp;amp;&#xD;
recognize the hand of' God, but -not trust it. 0, how dark&#xD;
and lonely looked the way of life! IL walked to the window&#xD;
and looked out through my blindiiig tears. 0, how dreary&#xD;
and miserable seemed that prospect which ever before had&#xD;
worn some new phase of beauty, - that long strip of "tidal&#xD;
sand" - the tall, black stakes of the "fishing.ponds "- the&#xD;
ravening waves in the foreground, stealing ever in and in, as&#xD;
death had stolen on me - the waste of wild waters backed by&#xD;
a shroud of gray March mist, through which streamed faintly&#xD;
the weak beams of the rising sun.&#xD;

Suddenly, twittering down upon a bunch of catnip, whose&#xD;
dry stalks rustled beneath the window, came two little brown&#xD;
sparrows. As I watched them, hopping from stalk to stalk,&#xD;
picking at the dried seed-whorls, I remembered His words,&#xD;
"Ye are of more value than many sparrows." Did He send&#xD;
them? 0, did He not ? - for my heart accepted their&#xD;
teaching, and was comforted.&#xD;
March 23d. I have looked my last upon that face; IL&#xD;
have seen the dust heaped over the coffin; I comprehend&#xD;
the mournful significance of the old minister's words, when&#xD;
he thanked friends and neighbors for their assistance in&#xD;
"burying our dead from sight."&#xD;
As IL turned away from that grave, now my only heritage,&#xD;
my hand was grasped by blind old Mr. B., who, with James,&#xD;
had come, not merely 'to pay the last respect to the dead, but&#xD;
to offer to the orphan daughter a home in their house.&#xD;
I was deeply touched by this kindness, but more by James'&#xD;
words and manner, when he said, timidly, as if his happiness&#xD;
might deepen my grief, that "Emily L- had forgiven&#xD;
him his errors - that she would be his wife in the spring, and&#xD;
longed to have me come."&#xD;
For a time I may go to them, but that must not be my&#xD;
"abiding place." A life of action must be mine. IL have&#xD;
health and education, and all up and down the great thor-&#xD;
oughfares of our land are those waiting to be taught. Some-&#xD;
where among these I shall find a place, an4 labor on until I&#xD;
go down to the grave, one of those&#xD;
"Whom men love not, but yet regret."&#xD;
March 25th. -" God said, Let there be light, and there&#xD;
was light!" Primordial words; yet have they not a sig-&#xD;
inificant relation to the experience of every soul? Thus it&#xD;
hath been with me.&#xD;
0, the dismantling of our old home; the moving of fur-&#xD;
niture that seems to have been made to fill just those places,&#xD;
&#xD;
'4-&#xD;
&#xD;
and none other; the rifling of drawers, and the desecration&#xD;
of even friendly hands touching the cherished relics of the&#xD;
dead! But it must be borne, that Mr. J- may have his&#xD;
"bond." He had kept, his promise, and IL should mine.&#xD;
After seeing the few relics IL had selected sent off to Mr.&#xD;
F.-.'s, who had kindly offered me a home, I begged his&#xD;
wife to leave me to pass the last few hours of daylight&#xD;
alone.&#xD;
0, those hours! too painful for me to recall. The wild&#xD;
tumult of recollections that coursed through niy mind, as I&#xD;
wandered from room to room, each one growing dearer and&#xD;
dearer, until, in the gathering darkness, with a blessing on the&#xD;
threshold, IL crossed it, never t~o return.&#xD;
The daffodils, planted years ago by hands now still in the&#xD;
grave, were out, and I gathered a handful, and stood leaning&#xD;
over the gate, how well I remembered the time when IL was&#xD;
obliged to stand on tip-toe to reach the latch! looking up to&#xD;
the leafless boughs of the maples, upon which the pale sun-&#xD;
light still lingered.&#xD;
0, those trees! They were rooted in my heart; they had&#xD;
mingled their low, slumberous music with my mother's soigs&#xD;
above my cradle, murmured solemn responses to my evening&#xD;
prayers, shaded my childish sports, my happy maiden dream-&#xD;
ings; and was it not meet that they should be leafless, now&#xD;
that my path was all shadow? Then IL rc~nembered my&#xD;
father, as he lay in his open coffin beneath them, while&#xD;
friends and neighbors crowded around to take a last look; I&#xD;
recalled the very play of the shadows on his pale face, as they&#xD;
lifted me up to kiss his cheek; and, resting my head upon the&#xD;
gate, IL wept with the convulsive bitterness of a child. How&#xD;
long I knew not; I was conscious of nothing, until a deep,&#xD;
manly voice at my side said, "Elizabeth!"&#xD;
I did not see the face - scarcely the arms that were held&#xD;
out to me; but the next moment I was folded close within&#xD;
their embrace. What were earthly houses, homes, lands to&#xD;

&#xD;
me then, when I knew the strong heart beneath my head&#xD;
would shelter me forever?&#xD;
Winding his arms closer and closer about me, as one cradles&#xD;
a weary child, he let me weep on, until my grief spent itself&#xD;
in long-drawn sobs. Then, raising my head, and drawing my&#xD;
arm through his, he said, "That will do, Elizabeth; you are&#xD;
getting cold."&#xD;
I moved on at once. When did I ever dream of opposing&#xD;
that tone, so quiet, yet so resistless? I did not even ask how&#xD;
he came there; it was enough that it was so. Nor did he&#xD;
tell; but instinctively divining, as it seemed, that my way lay&#xD;
towards Mr. F-~--'s, he walked on quietly, speaking of the&#xD;
shows of country life. But, when within a few yards of the&#xD;
door, he paused, and, taking both my hands in his, said&#xD;
earnestly, "Elizabeth, you have suffered ex~dtement enough&#xD;
for one day, and .too much; but, before we part to-night, it is&#xD;
fitting and right that I should ask and you should answer one&#xD;
question.&#xD;
"I love you, Elizabeth. Tell me, is it as I hope? does&#xD;
your heart fully respond to mine? will it trust me forever?"&#xD;
lie had put me from him, and stood looking down into my&#xD;
eyes with that deep questioning gaze of his. For a moment&#xD;
I could not speak.&#xD;
"Elizabeth, my pu~pjl!"&#xD;
"My master, my all!" and then he gathered me to his&#xD;
breast; his lips met mine, and the garnered love of years was&#xD;
poured out in that kiss.&#xD;
Suddenly loosing me from his embrace, he said, " This is&#xD;
wrong; you are faint and weary, poor child. I have much to&#xD;
say, but my words must wait until to-morrow. Let me come&#xD;
to you, say at nine in the morning, and, in the mean time,&#xD;
please make such temporary arrangements as you wish, for we&#xD;
must be in New Haven to-morrow night."&#xD;
"We! SQ soon? What for?" I asked in a breath.&#xD;
"0, for several reasons," he said, smiling that old quiet&#xD;

smile; "the strongest, perhaps, because I have busied myself&#xD;

a certain treasure is there."&#xD;
"But-but"-&#xD;
"0, you know, of old, that I never entertain 'buts!' You&#xD;
have promised to trust me for the future, and I mean hence-&#xD;
forth that the trust shall be no sinecure. There, now promise&#xD;
me you will go in and go to sleep; promise, my darling."&#xD;
My darling! Are there sweeter words in our mother&#xD;
tongue? I promised, but how can I sleep? There are nights&#xD;
enough to come, in which to sleep; hut these emotions -~ they&#xD;
come but once in a lifetime; there may be others, deeper,&#xD;
richer, more intense, but these come never again! His dar-&#xD;

New Haven, April 10th. He came that morning, a~id,&#xD;
after some explanatory chat with dear Mrs. F-, I went up&#xD;
stairs, at his suggestion, to put on my travelling-dress, in &amp;amp;rder&#xD;
to take a short walk before the carriage came, whic~was to&#xD;
take us to the city. When I came down, T- was still&#xD;
talking earnestly with Mrs. F-J-, who inspected my dress&#xD;
closely (it was the pretty travelling-dress I had in ll-.-.),&#xD;
pulled a plait here and another there, and seemed altogether&#xD;
nervous and excited, a thing very unusual for her.&#xD;
We walked on, talking of the past, calling up the days of&#xD;
my pupilage, and the words and glances which had at once said&#xD;
so much and so little, until we stood by my mother's grave,&#xD;
silently, a few moments; then he said, "We are both orphans,&#xD;
and both free, -free to act as we choose, - are ~we not, Eliz-&#xD;
abeth?"&#xD;
And I answered, "Yes."&#xD;
"Then go with me."&#xD;
I did not hesitate, though I apprehended his meaning, when&#xD;
he drew my arm through his, and led me into the church,&#xD;
where were gathered the old minister, Mr. and Mrs. F---,&#xD;
and a few of the old neighbors. In a few moments we had&#xD;

ratified before the world the vows of our hearts, and turned to&#xD;
meet the congratulations of the few friends. T--- spoke for&#xD;
me, kindly and gently thanking them for all their kindness;&#xD;
and then, in his quiet way, stepped past them, and placed me&#xD;
in the carriage waiting at the door.&#xD;
"My wife, my own wife !" lie whispered, as he took his&#xD;
seat by my side.&#xD;
Ah, then I saw my mistake! Then I knew that there were&#xD;
sweeter words than those of the evening before; but, surely,&#xD;
none ~n earth or heaven that can equal these!&#xD;
Now we are at home, a pleasant home, ay, and a rich&#xD;
one, for it contains two happy human hearts. IL have been&#xD;
too happy to ask an explanation of the past as yet. But that&#xD;
Mrs. N-; I '11 ask him about her when he lays down&#xD;
that paper.&#xD;
"Harold, hGw was it about that Mrs. N----? Come, ex-&#xD;
plain."&#xD;
"Yes, darling, when you please to. enlighten me about that&#xD;
"0, y~u quibbling lawyer! why don't you tell a~ straight&#xD;
story, and say~ you were completely fascinated?"&#xD;
"Because no man is obliged to criminate himself, especially&#xD;
when he is not guilty."&#xD;
"But was n't you, a little well, interested in her at one&#xD;
time?"       -&#xD;
"No, if', by interested, you mean anything. more than mere&#xD;
acquaintance. Surtdy, you do not believe it?" and he came&#xD;
round to a seat on the sofa, by my side.&#xD;
"No, indeed; but what was there about it? The interest&#xD;
was on her side, then, was it not?"&#xD;
"I thought I taught y~ou long ago not to ask impertinent&#xD;
questions. Now it 's my turn to catechize. Why did n't you&#xD;
marry young E-----?"&#xD;
"Because I did not love him well enough. But who told&#xD;
you he offered himself?"&#xD;
&#xD;
~'&#xD;
&#xD;
"No one; I inferred it from some things. Besides, I was&#xD;
given to understand that it was a settled thing."&#xD;
"Indeed! by whom?"&#xD;
"Your aunt, for one."&#xD;
"And you believed it?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Well, I must confess my opinion of your penetration is&#xD;
lessened perceptibly."&#xD;
"Very likely; a not unusual experience with married&#xD;
ladies, I believe. Bat, Bessie," - he went on, prisoning-my&#xD;
hands in his, and speaking gravely, .--" you ought not to re-&#xD;
gret it, for it taught me the best lesson I ever learned -how&#xD;
dear you were to my heart. I hoped that the absurd rumor&#xD;
about Mrs. N-.--. would do as much for you; but it seems&#xD;
you defended her like a true knight-errant."&#xD;
"No, no, Harold; say rather it was a proud woman's ex-&#xD;
piation for giving, as she thought, her heart unsought~~&#xD;
"My poor Bessie," he said, thoughtfully, raising my head&#xD;
from his breast, "you must have suffered."&#xD;
"I did; but tell me, you have seen Dr. G---- ? ~'&#xD;
"Yes; or I should~ not have you sitting by my side, ~iy~&#xD;
wife - the dearest sight a man can see on earth; at least, not&#xD;
until long years, perhaps of trial, had taught me the truth."&#xD;
"And he told you that I "-&#xD;
"No, he said no such thing. But he called himself and&#xD;
inc all manner of hard names, and ordered me to come right&#xD;
down to M-, 'an' I loved him.' Moreover he told me&#xD;
Mr. H- is to marry his cousin, Miss Etnilia Cranston."&#xD;
"Good!" I exclaimed; and then, sparing H- as much&#xD;
as possible, IL told him all the story of my stay at uncle's- all&#xD;
my trials, struggles and temptations; and he, my noble hus-&#xD;
band, he understood them all, and pointed out to me their&#xD;
uses; how they had widened and deepened my sympathies with&#xD;
humanity, made me stronger and wiser fot' the battle of life,&#xD;

ing beneath the crushed-looking bonnets of toilworn mothers&#xD;
returning from their labor, and bathing as in a stream of&#xD;
golden water the heads of numberless little white-haired&#xD;
children, as they rushed forth to meet their parents, or played&#xD;
upon the pavement. One strong sunbeam, like ~n angel of*&#xD;
mercy, had spied the pale child in that gloomy door-way,&#xD;
and, creeping from roof to roof, at length fell upon the dwell-&#xD;
ing above her, then sliding down slowly and silently, like&#xD;
all sweet, holy influences, rested upon her head, and lit up&#xD;
her meek, pale face with a glow which was very beautiful to&#xD;
behold.&#xD;
A glad light sprang to her eyes, a faint smile broke&#xD;
round her mouth, as she felt its warmth upon her forehead;&#xD;
for a moment she watched the motes dancing in its golden&#xD;
light; then her gaze was directed, as before, earnestly up the&#xD;
street. As she sat thus, the pavements began to echo to the&#xD;
heavier footsteps of men returning from their work, and there&#xD;
was a confused murmur of tongues, - Irish, English, French&#xD;
and German. But the loudest-toned among them instinc-&#xD;
tively lowered his voice as he caught a glimpse of that child&#xD;
sitting -i~i the ~unlight, and not a few of those hard, care-worn&#xD;
faces greeted her with a kindly smile. One fat, motherly-&#xD;
looking Irish woman paused beside her, and, taking a small&#xD;
bouquet of the commonest of garden flowers from among the&#xD;
mass of articles that crowded the basket on her arm, placed&#xD;
it in the child's hand, saying -&#xD;
"May be ye would like that, me darlint."&#xD;
"0, thank you, thank you!" exclaimed the child, raising&#xD;
her eyes, gushing with delighted surprise. "It is so long&#xD;
since I have seen a flower. You are so very kind."&#xD;
"An' who would n't be kind to ye, aroon, wid the angel&#xD;
looking out of yer eyes, so like the one that once slept ~n my&#xD;
own breast, and is now wid the blissed virgin in he~v.en?"&#xD;
sai'd the Irish mo1jh~, crossing herself,' and pressing iwr hard&#xD;
hand to her bosom with a mournful gesture, as she passed on.&#xD;

&#xD;
To most of my readers, whose lives have been set round&#xD;
and garlanded with those autographs of the Divinity, - the&#xD;
blessed flowers, - it will be difficult to describe the intense&#xD;
joy, the loving tenderness, with which that little girl gazed&#xD;
on those humble flower, and pressed them to her lips and&#xD;
eyes; or what a chain of associationS they awoke in her&#xD;
young mind, which reached from earth to heaven. It' seemed&#xD;
that these were not all of joy, for the glow of delight which&#xD;
had lit up her face faded slowly away, and in its place came&#xD;
a look of patient sorrow a sorrow that gave to her features&#xD;
the thoughtfulness of mature years.&#xD;
As she sat, thus busy with memory, a boy, of some eight&#xD;
years, came rapidly down the Street, and, seeing that'she did&#xD;
not observe him, crept stealthily along in the deep shadow of&#xD;
the old walls, until he stood behind her unperceived, and,&#xD;
clapping his little brown hands with delight as he stooped to&#xD;
kiss her, exclaimed:&#xD;
"Oaught, fairly caught asleep once, Susie!"&#xD;
The little girl smiled, and, holding up her flowers, said:&#xD;
"See, Willie, are they not beautiful ?"&#xD;
Then, in reply to his words of admiration an4 inqu~y, she.&#xD;
went on to tell, out of the gratitude of her heart, of the kind~ -&#xD;
ness of the world in general, and the fat Irish woman in par-&#xD;
ticular, as m~ifested toward her; then, returning to the&#xD;
flowers, she sa~;: ~T&#xD;
"Look here, Willie; those twc~ and that blue one are just&#xD;
like the flowers that grew in our garden at Woburn. Do&#xD;
you remember the violets and blue periwinkle each side of th~&#xD;
gate, and the clump of lilacs at the end of the alley, and&#xD;
but no, you. were too small when we left to remember. De~t~&#xD;
Woburn!" she added, sadly, as if touched by some mournful&#xD;
recollection.&#xD;
"Not the flowers, Susie, though I love them well enough for&#xD;
their own sakes as well as for-yours; but I ~do remember Dr.&#xD;
Murdook's big dog, Painter, and how he used to let me ride&#xD;

~ ing the shade on her face ~with the quick eye of affection;&#xD;
'when I get to ~be a man, which will be before a thousand&#xD;
years," and he fairly rose two inches in his shoes, we were&#xD;
about to say, but cannot, seeing that his feet were bare, - in&#xD;
his desire to convince her of the speedy fulfilment of his&#xD;
words, "we will have another cottage, just like the one at&#xD;
Wobarn, with a garden and lots of flowers; for, though I&#xD;
don't remember much about it, you can tell me, and you&#xD;
shall have a little roOm to yourself, with plants in it as big&#xD;
as trees, if you like."&#xD;
She drew him down beside her, and, passing her hand lov-&#xD;
ingly over his mass of brown hair, said, with a smild:&#xD;
"You are the best and:kindest brother in the whole world,&#xD;
Willie."&#xD;
"And who would n't be kind to you, Susie?'~ he replied,&#xD;
unconsciously repeating the words of the Irish mother; "I&#xD;
could not be otherwise if I tried. But come, let us go into&#xD;
the house and see mother."&#xD;
'~ Mother has gone to carry home the clothes she has been&#xD;
washing," said Susie, as she turned to reach behind her for&#xD;
something 'within 'the door.&#xD;
"Never mind, Susie," said her brother, laying his hand on&#xD;
her arm, "let me be your crutch to~night. I will be very&#xD;
steady, indeed I will."&#xD;
She smiled, and, ashe carefully assisted hef'to rise, it was&#xD;
easy to see why she, so small and childish-looking herself,&#xD;
should have spoken to that well-developed boy of her older&#xD;
memory.&#xD;
Her face,. with its thoughtful look of patient sorrow, 'might&#xD;
have been taken, as it was, in truth, for the face of a girl of&#xD;
twelve summers, but her lower limbs' were small even to&#xD;
deformity, and oiie hip much drawn from its place.&#xD;
As they turned from the door, she cast another anxious&#xD;

with a look of sorrowful inquiry.&#xD;
The boy understood the glance, for he replied, sadly:&#xD;
"I fear he will not come to-night, Susie."&#xD;
"Why not? Have you seen him?" she askedeagerly.&#xD;
"He came as far as the corner of - street with me;&#xD;
there he met some boys, who persuaded him to go into a tezi'~&#xD;

along the gloomy old passage that led to their room.&#xD;

Widow Panvers and her children, however bare of even 'the&#xD;

     in her large, dark eyes. But these children, familiar with&#xD;
misery, saw nothing in that face but the radiance of a moth-&#xD;
er's love, and, in her shortened respiration and the quick&#xD;
throbbing of her heart, as she pressed their young hands to&#xD;
her bosom and sank upon a chair, nothing but evidences&#xD;
of her joy at seeing them again. Tirue, little Susie, with her&#xD;
premature development, born of pain and sorrow, had once&#xD;
or twice of late felt a shudder pass e~er her, as if the shadow&#xD;
of the wing of the death-angel re&amp;amp;fed upon her, when she&#xD;
looked, in her mother's face and noted her failing steps; but&#xD;
she had shrunk from it, and thrust it away from her, as if&#xD;
such a fearful thought questioned the goodness of God.&#xD;
Childhood is so slow to ~pprehend death.&#xD;
While the weary moth~x listened to the murmuring voices&#xD;
of the children, another form emerged from the ~rkness of&#xD;
the passage; but -whether its gloom still clung to him from&#xD;
affinity, or whether it was owing to the atmosphere of evil&#xD;
which for many months had been gathering round his heart,&#xD;
we cannot say- a dark cloud rested upon his handsome,&#xD;
boyish features, and gave to them a bitter, disagreeable&#xD;
expression. And i~med that neither the glad welcome&#xD;
of the ~Jiildren,~ the more gentle one of the another, had&#xD;
pow9r t~4ase it away; for he threw himself moodily upon&#xD;
~f*~ chair, and deigned no reply~ to their kind and loving words.&#xD;
"X fear you are ~iet well, to-night, Gee," said the&#xD;
mother, approaching and laying her thin, bon~~fingers upon&#xD;
his wrist~&#xD;
lie drew hi~ ann hastily away, saying:&#xD;
"Well? I don't know what any one should wish to be&#xD;
well for. The sooner one dies and is out of t~ie way the&#xD;
better."&#xD;
"But, my dear child ".-.-&#xD;
"Ah, yes! I know all that you would say," he interrupted,&#xD;
with a gesture of impatience. "I know all that cant about&#xD;
God's wisdom, and goodness, and providence, and discipline,&#xD;
&#xD;
and all that. It is a part of God's wisdom, I suppose; that&#xD;
allows one man to cheat another out of all he has, -a part&#xD;
of his providential discipline that we and thousands like us&#xD;
must drudge, drudge night and day, and starve at that, - a&#xD;
part of his boasted goodness," he went on bitterly, casting &amp;amp;&#xD;
glance at little Susie, "that brings children into this world&#xD;
only to suffer, to drag through life a burden to themselves&#xD;
and others. Better diq~ at once;~ or, better still, never to~&#xD;
have been born."&#xD;
Little Susie, who had maxiaged to get clos~ to his side, and.&#xD;
lay her thin hand upon his shoulder, drew in her breath, a~&#xD;
if a sharp pain passed through her,~ and, creeping away,&#xD;
seated herself in the shadow of the door, for shewould not&#xD;
that they should see the tears. that thered in her ~yes.&#xD;
"A bu~4en to herself and others ! " God only knows how&#xD;
deeply those bitter words pierced her heart. They were~nQt&#xD;
new to her. Careless, thoughtless people had repeated thew.&#xD;
in whispers to each other, as they gazed on her wasted limbs~&#xD;
- whispers which she did not fail to catch and translate into&#xD;
words; and lips, which should have opened only to bless and&#xD;
pity her,. had uttered them again and again in i~nes of pier-&#xD;
ulous complaint; yet custom had not dulled their po~t~ or&#xD;
taken from them aught of their bitterness. Thay~ brought&#xD;
a cloud before her eyes and hea~~ so dark and thick, tl~at~. it&#xD;

guarded the memory of the hours passed there like a holy&#xD;
thing; and since error and sin had driven them from its sheb&#xD;
ter, and, like the Angel of Wrath at the gates of Eden,&#xD;
barred the entrance, she had bathed it in the light of a pure&#xD;
and loving natures until,&#xD;
"Of all the beautiful pictures&#xD;
That hang in MenlQry's hail,"&#xD;
this seemed dearest, brightest and&#xD;
Her fa1~her had been the village ysician, and, though a&#xD;
man of 'hasty, impulsive di n, was generally much&#xD;
respected and beloved, is wife's rich, genial nature was&#xD;
like sunshine and dew to all who came within her influence.&#xD;
The~e~ was one object~'towards which she felt drawn with more&#xD;
than a ~oman's instinctive fondness. This was to little&#xD;
George, her husband's child by a former maria but, un-&#xD;
fortwiately for both the mother and the child, the strong&#xD;
prejudices of his mother's family were brought to bear against&#xD;
her, and the child at length withdrawn from her care for&#xD;
months together.&#xD;
Still, her heart followed him with loving thoughts, and&#xD;
when God fihibd up the measure of her cup of happiness by&#xD;
sendir~g her own little Susie, she did not selfishly forget the&#xD;
xnotherle~s boy, but her thoughts turned to him with even&#xD;
xn&amp;amp;re tenderness than befbr&amp;amp;~ and the first word the little&#xD;
girl was taught to utterwas the name of her bMher. During&#xD;
the short visits which he made at his father's house, the boy&#xD;
coildn~t, in spite 'of the power of prejudice, i'e~i~t her gentle&#xD;
influence; and, as he listened to her sweet toncs~ and looked&#xD;
into hei soft, dark eyes, his thoughts grew troubled, and he&#xD;
wondered how it could be that one so kind aDd gentle should&#xD;
be ~o thoroughly selfish as he had~ been taught to believe her.&#xD;
The longest of these visits was~ made ju~t at the time ~vhen&#xD;
little Susie was recovering from the terrible illness that had&#xD;
left her a cripple for life. The little girl' was delighted with&#xD;
his company; besides, she was so gentle and 'patient in her&#xD;
&#xD;
helplessness, that he could not help feeling ~drawn towards&#xD;
her, and he soon cast off his rough habits, and learned to&#xD;
speak softly and step lightly as his mother herself; and when&#xD;
she was, at length, permitted to go out in her little carriage,&#xD;
and he saw her wholly committed to his care, he was delighted&#xD;
with the responsibility. He felt that he was trusted for the&#xD;
first time in his life; for the cold, suspicious temper of hi~&#xD;
aunts, and their harsh' ginents, were ill calculated to foster&#xD;
in the mind of childhoO ~ither confidence or self~i~s~ect; and&#xD;
not infrequently, in after years, when 'yielding to th4 evil in-&#xD;
fluences around him, his heart recalled these brief weeks of&#xD;
his childhood with bitter regret. When Susie was about eight&#xD;
years old, Dr. Danvers became security}~ ~ dst~Velative&#xD;
of his wife, to the amount of several thousand d~ll~~/~ This&#xD;
person soon became a bankrupt, and involved the doctor in his&#xD;
ruin. This unfortunate affair filled up the measure of Mrs.&#xD;
Dancers' unpopularity with his first wife's Telations'; for,&#xD;
though she had not failed to remonstrate gently and caln4~&#xD;
with her husband, at the time, on the propriety of' thus,~risking&#xD;
his all, the whole blame of the affair was thrown upon her,&#xD;
chiefly because she refused to join in th~ bitter reproaches&#xD;
with which they chafed his impatient, irrital4e spirit. Though&#xD;
intelligent, genial and generous, iDr. ]2~anver0 possessed but&#xD;
little independence of character. He lacked energy t~ meet&#xD;
his difficulties~and the moral courage to face his changed cir-&#xD;
cumstances. He was one of those natures "too proud to&#xD;
dig, and a~hemed to beg;" therefore, notwithstanding the&#xD;
words of cheer and encouragement he received ~from his wife,&#xD;
he soon yielded to despair. Well would it have been ~if this&#xD;
had been all! But, like many another proud, disappointed&#xD;
man, he soug~ forgetfi~ilness in the wine-cup, and in a short&#xD;
time all traces of the generous spirit of his youth were&#xD;
effaced by the r~~id 'encroachment ~of the demon intem-&#xD;

Georges oharaQter ~was much more marked and decided,&#xD;
even ~t t~iat. early age, than his father's. His passions and&#xD;
prejudices were very strong, and the- course of training to&#xD;
which he had been subjected in his grandmother's house had&#xD;
not tended to restrain them, while it had succeeded in stinging&#xD;
~ that was genial and generous in his nature with distrust&#xD;
and ~uspioi9n. lie had been taught to recognize the law of&#xD;
Fear, but not of Love. His own property, inherited1from his&#xD;
mother, had baen lost in the general wreck; and. so deeply&#xD;
had it been instilled into him that this loss was in some way&#xD;
the result of his father's second marriage, that the spirit in&#xD;
which he returned to share their poverty was little calculated&#xD;
to add-to the peace or comfort of the ruined household. The&#xD;
selfishness of The father - who, in his degradation, did not hesi-&#xD;
tate to indulge his own appetites at the expense of his family -&#xD;
and his fretful, unreasonable temper, chafed and embittered&#xD;
the quiek, impetuous spirit of the boy to such a degree, that&#xD;
anger and contention were soon added to the iu~anjmi~eries&#xD;
of their miserable home. Notwithstaiuling I~is ~trong preju-&#xD;
dice, the boy had not been with *l~xii many weeks, before, -he-&#xD;
felt compelled to admire the unwearied patience and goodkiess&#xD;
of his mother; yet, instead of being drawn to follow heTr ex~&#xD;
ample, his feeling of admiration often changed into one of&#xD;
&#xD;
j~&#xD;
&#xD;
angry contempt that she could so tamely submit to the impe,&#xD;
rious, unreasonable exactions of his father. At such times~&#xD;
with a recklessness strange to himself, he would-join his father&#xD;
in ridiculing her unshaken faith in the goodness of God; and&#xD;
the infirmities of little Susie formed a ne~r4ailing illustra.&#xD;
tion on this point; for so rapidly had the demon gained upon&#xD;
the man, that the father had already learned to look upon his&#xD;
suffering child as a burden and a trouble,- a care that de-&#xD;
prived him of the undivided attention of his w1fe,~ and an&#xD;
expense that curtailed him in many of the ir~dulgenc~s of his&#xD;
former life, which, in his utter selfishness, he did n~ hesitate ~,&#xD;
to exact from the labor of his. wife and children. In his in-&#xD;
most heart the boy often bitterly regretted -yielding :to ,this&#xD;
dark spirit; and, though he was too proud to manifest it in&#xD;
words, he would often take up the little girl on his knee,' and,&#xD;
while bending his head to meet her caresses, talk to her of&#xD;
their early days at Woburn, until her pale face grew radiant&#xD;
with delight. Thit beyond the walls of that humble room.&#xD;

spirit within him, but much -0, how much !.- to tempt him&#xD;
on to sin and crime. Soon after their arrival in the city, his&#xD;
father had apprenticed him to a shoemaker,, in spite of his&#xD;
strong repugnance to the occupation, and earnest entreati~s to&#xD;
be permitted to seek some* other mode of living. At the&#xD;
time of his father's death, which. happened some two~years&#xD;
after, he left his employer, and, joining a gang of reckless&#xD;
boys like himself subsisted, his mother knew not how, for&#xD;
his visits home grew more and more rarer and his mood more&#xD;
and mor~ impa1~ient and irritable. Even the kind greetings&#xD;
and I6ving ~qds ~hi ever awaited him in that&#xD;
home seemed ~ i~e~oa -to the unhappy boy, and sometime0-&#xD;
he would cease to~ ~1~t t1i~n~. f&amp;amp;months.&#xD;

o~ded, and the magic tones led him gently ba~k on the track&#xD;
of ~his yotith, until he sat once more beneath the vine-covered&#xD;
trellises of Andernach, with the ~ soft eyes of his Gr~tchen&#xD;
looking into his, while her sweet voice blended with:that of&#xD;
his beloved Creniona, gentle eyes, up~n which~the gr~u sod&#xD;

many years! And ~ too, was' a ~ thought~ and&#xD;
there was wisdom and pief~y in it, which 'led the old -man,&#xD;
when his troop of ila en-haired grandchildren gathered about&#xD;
his knees, and mingled their young voices with his, to play&#xD;
C&#xD;
&#xD;
those songs which ~he had loved best ;~ for he felt that her&#xD;
voice, though undistinguishable to mortal ears, did not fail to&#xD;
accompany them. We hear much about evil being contagious;&#xD;

2      poor German family, their strong affection fox. each other,&#xD;
bursting forth at eve in rich melodies, seemed to breathe a&#xD;
benediction upon that miserable neighborhood; and to no one&#xD;
heart did it bring such a wealth of blessing as to that of the&#xD;
suffering Susie Danvers.&#xD;
"Let me sit longer, dear mother-the music eases this wea-&#xD;
risome pain in my hip," she was accni~t4omedto say, when her&#xD;
mother spoke to her ~of the necessity of retiring; and thus&#xD;
night after night found her Beated in the old. door-way, watch-&#xD;
ing the happy faces of the children, as they clustered around&#xD;
the old man's chair, by the open. window, until in the gather.&#xD;
ing darkness she could not distinguish one face from another,&#xD;
and catching with her quick, unerring ear every note of their&#xD;
music, until the glorious strains of Beethoven, Handel, and.&#xD;
Bach, were as familiar to her as her~cradl~ hymns. Presently&#xD;
she began to accompany them, but very jowly, fearing, in her&#xD;
timidity and bashfulness, that they would be offended at her&#xD;
presumption, should they hear her, And this new pleasure&#xD;
brought another, that helped to while away the wearisome&#xD;
pain in her limbs - the thought of George's surprise and&#xD;
pleasure when he became aware of her progress; and 0,&#xD;
how anxiously, how impatiently, did she watch for him 4o&#xD;

And yet Widow Danvers did live, though God alone knows&#xD;
the crushing weight of the blow, when strange hands brought&#xD;
in her bright-eyed little Willie, and laid him down before her,&#xD;
a mangled corpse. And poor little Susie it seemed as if&#xD;
that heavy wall, in crushing him, had stunned her also, so&#xD;
mute and motionless did sho sit gazing for hours upon the&#xD;
dead clilld's face. Then there were heavy footsteps in that&#xD;
dark passage, and the children of the neighborhood hung&#xD;
round the door, and gazed shylyj~nd curiously at the little&#xD;
rough coffin that was borne away to the Potter's Field, and&#xD;
placed beneath its scanty covering of earth. And we~ it,&#xD;
was that. Susie's lameness, and the mother's failing strengtlj~&#xD;
prevented them following i~4is grave ~ for~thus they&#xD;
happily ~pared a knowledge of tli~revolting .featur~ ~f~&amp;amp;&#xD;

it comforted thei~ hearts to think that he slept in isome stick&#xD;
quiet place. This thought of her boy's last home grew 'vary&#xD;
dear to the widow's heart, in proportion as the love Which she&#xD;
had borne him seemed to be drawing her slowly and surely to&#xD;
lie down by his side. Of her dead child she could truly say,&#xD;
"lit is well!" but of the living, - the suffering and th~&#xD;
erring, - there came hou.r~ in which even her strong faith ii1&#xD;
God was uct sufficient to face the thought of leaving them;&#xD;
hours which we will not attempt to describe, for none but a&#xD;
mother's heart could sound their depths of misery. But as&#xD;
her footsteps drew nearer and nearer the spirit-land, a ray of&#xD;
its blessed light seemed to fall upon her troubled heart, and&#xD;
hush it to rest. An orphan herself, she had no relations&#xD;
nearer than cousins; to these she wrote, confiding both her,&#xD;
children to their care, and, relying much upon the. promise of&#xD;
the kind ]Irishwornan (who, won by little Susie's resemblance&#xD;
to her lost darling, had sought th~u oi4~4 prov~1 her&#xD;
friendship by many a self-denying deed),~ii~t the litt1~ girl&#xD;
should not suffer as long as a crust or a potato was to be&#xD;
shared in her own family, she laid aside 4ie needle, which her&#xD;
trembling fingers could no longer hold, and awaited her re-&#xD;

George and his future fate. Months had elapsed ~ince his&#xD;
footsteps had crossed their threshold, and it seemed as if the&#xD;
hope of seeing him once more had kept alive the flickering&#xD;
flame of life through the dreary days of winter. But day&#xD;
after day passed, and she could only w~tch and pray. She&#xD;
knew not that through her death he was to be quickened into&#xD;
spiritual life.&#xD;

"Mother!" said the'child, an.xiotisly.&#xD;
"Don't be anxious, my child. I feel no worse to-night,&#xD;
and I did wrong to speak in that impatient tone; but I was&#xD;
thinking of the moonlight at Woburn. Helps me to move&#xD;
my pillow a little, darling, and then sing. It will, as you.&#xD;
often say, ease this wearisome pain in my side."&#xD;
The child arranged the pillows, and was about to place her&#xD;
~tool clc~e by her mother's side, when the latter, pointing to a&#xD;
spot where the moonlight slept on the floor, said,&#xD;
"Not here, my child, but in the moonlight yonder. I can&#xD;
see your face better there."&#xD;
Susie. obeyed, and, with her bird-like tones, subdued and&#xD;
deepened by emotion, began Schubert's "Ave Maria." As&#xD;
those plaintive notes, so full of tearful, earnest entreaty, fell&#xD;
upon the mother's heart, she cast one long, loving glance at&#xD;
the childish figure sitting in the moonlight; then, closing her&#xD;
eyes as if in sleep, her soul passed with that beautiful melody&#xD;
from earth t~h~a.ven.&#xD;
But the e1~d k~iew it not. The narrow strip of moonlight&#xD;
crept stealthily nearer and nearer the wall, as if conscious of&#xD;
the presence of the. shadowy terror there; but the singer still&#xD;
continued to breathe forth those touching notes of supplication&#xD;
for that aid and protection ~he now so much needed. The&#xD;
moonlight stole quite away, and in the gathering darkness she&#xD;
did not see the boyish figure that stood in that dark old door-&#xD;
way, nor the expression of delighted surprise' that lit, up his&#xD;
face as he listened to her tones. She did not hear his low&#xD;
step as he stole across the floor, nor see the startled look of&#xD;
horror and remorse that crossed his face, as the pale, ghastly&#xD;
features of his mother met his gate. But his exclamation of&#xD;
surprise aroused her, and she drew near to his side.&#xD;
"0! mother, mother!" he groaned, taking the ehild'&amp;amp;iiand&#xD;
in his, and laying it upon that pale, cold fore~iead. That&#xD;
fearful chill'wa~ not to be mistaken. it seemed to strike to&#xD;
the child's heart. She sunk down by her brother's side, and,&#xD;
&#xD;
forgetting everything but her need of love, hid her face in his&#xD;
bosom. He drew her closely to him, while he repeated, in that&#xD;
same broken tone, "0! mother, mother, have I killed you at&#xD;
last?"&#xD;
"She blessed you-only a few moments since she blessed&amp;amp;&#xD;
you, George, and bade me say that, if she had failed to make&#xD;
you feel how truly she had loved you, as she feared she had,~&#xD;
you must forgive her," said Susie, raising her head from it~&#xD;
new-found resting-place.&#xD;
Again that smothered cry, "0! mother, mother!" so full&#xD;
of anguish and remorse, burst from the boy's lips, while the&#xD;
child went on, in a voice broken and full of tears:&#xD;
"And she told me not to grieve too bitterly, if I was left&#xD;
alone, dear George; for that you would come back, and love&#xD;
me, even as she had loved me; that you would. be mother&#xD;
and brother to ~&#xD;
"And, by the help of God, I will!" exclaimed the boy;&#xD;
earnestly. "Mother, I promise!" he continued,. rising to his&#xD;
feet, and kissing the high, pale forehead of .tlde~d.&#xD;
Through the long watches of that night the overwearied&#xD;
Susie slept calmly near her dead mother's side, while George&#xD;
sat by, nursing high resolves and earn,~s~-purposes; resolves&#xD;
and purposes which he carried out, notwithout many ~ severe&#xD;
struggle, and now and then a fall; for the power of tempta-&#xD;
tion from without and within was very strong. 13i4 an angel,&#xD;
in the shape of a feeble child, with soft, clear eyes,, and a&#xD;
glorious voice, walked ever before him on the upward path,&#xD;
and drew him after, by the strong eoi~'4s of love, until, in&#xD;
spite of the .weaktiess of his own heart a~nd the sneers of his&#xD;
old companions in evil, he triumphed. The kind voices of his&#xD;
neighbors bade him "God-speed," for his mother's sake, and&#xD;
not a few hard, toil~-~oi~n. hands were put forth to aid both&#xD;
him and Susie. Amozig these none were n'~re true and&#xD;

they did not turn away from him, but all heartily assented to&#xD;
the white-haited grandfather's remark, "If he has sinned, my&#xD;

A TALE OF THE COLONY TIMES.&#xD;
"In the good old Colony times,&#xD;
When we lived under the King."&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
Ev~ to this day the inhabitants of New England~ seldom&#xD;
speak of the tyrannical measures of the British government&#xD;
toward the colonies, during the reign of George Ill., with-&#xD;
out some show of indignation. Yet any one familiar with&#xD;
their history cannot fail to see that, under the preceding&#xD;
reigns, they had often suffered from far greater wrongs th~ii.&#xD;
those illegal taxes that struck the keynote to the revolution.&#xD;
This was especially true of New Hampshire, under the&#xD;
first royal governors. Mason, the grandson of the famous&#xD;
Captain John, of Pequod memory,' had, in 11sseiting~%his&#xD;
claims to his grandfather's grant, succeeded in separating the&#xD;
colony from Massachusetts, under whose jurisdiction the&#xD;
first settlement had been made. In this he was aided by his&#xD;
relative, Edward Randolph, that "blasted wretch,"' as one&#xD;
of our old historians terms him, who crossed the Atlantic n~j,&#xD;
less than eight times in nine years, 'in his indefatigable zeaf&#xD;
to procure the downfall of our charter government, hi which&#xD;
mischievous errand he but 'too well succeeded.&#xD;
A President and Council were~appointed, by Ids ~ajesty'&#xD;
Charles IL, for the government ~f the provin&amp;amp;~; and~ as 'the&#xD;
separation had been in direct opposition to the wishes of the&#xD;
people, he shrewdly nominated ~evera1 of the most distin~&#xD;

&#xD;
gushed gentlemen in the colony to the first Council. They&#xD;
were men who had held high offices, both civil and military,&#xD;
under the colonial government, and nothing but the unavoid-&#xD;
able necessity of submitting to this change, and the fear that,&#xD;
in case of theii refusal, others, less true to the interests of&#xD;
the people, would be substituted, induced them- to accept the&#xD;
nomination. Their acceptance was a sore disappointment to&#xD;
Mason and his coadjutors. After striving for some months&#xD;
to intimidate or cajole them into furthering theirL selfish and&#xD;
ambitious ends, Mason returned to England, where he so&#xD;
completely gained the ear of the voluptuous monarch, that&#xD;
the form of government was once more changed, and Edward&#xD;
Cranfleld appointed royal governor.&#xD;
His commission, which bears the date of May 9th, 1681,&#xD;
gave him almost absolute power, and he was a man little cal..&#xD;
culated, either by nature or education, to neglect any of the&#xD;
prerogatives of his office. A stanch royalist, a devoted ad-&#xD;
herent to the forms of the established church, he had little&#xD;
sympathy with the thoughts, ends and aims, of that singular&#xD;
people whom he came to govern, and his strong -prejudices&#xD;
and arrogant 'manners were ill calculated to win either their&#xD;
love or respect.&#xD;
He was empowered to appoint all general officers, and to&#xD;
suspend such members of the Council as gave him just cause&#xD;
of offence, they -being, at the same time, declared not eligible&#xD;
to the General Assembly, the only body elected -bythe people.&#xD;
- -    It was -not long, therefore, before. he saw himself supported&#xD;
by a Council wholly ~iubservient to his will.&#xD;
-But the members of the Assembly were sternly true to&#xD;
their trust; and, :cor~voking them twice, and finding them as&#xD;
resolute and firm in maintaining - their tights as had been&#xD;
their sires and brothers in the reign of Charles I., like~that&#xD;
unhappy monarch, at whose court his early youth had been&#xD;
spent, and whom he seemed to take for his- model, he sud..&#xD;
denly dismissed them, and, with hi~ Council, assumed the&#xD;
&#xD;
whole of the legislative power, taxing the people without&#xD;
their consent, and fining and imprisoning such as dared to&#xD;
complain of injustice. -&#xD;
This tyrannical conduct bore heavily upon the inhabitants -&#xD;
of Portsmouth and its vicinity. Fifty years had elapsed&#xD;
since the so-called company of "I~aconia," headed by Mason&#xD;
and Gorges, had raised the first rude hut near the mouth of&#xD;
the pleasant Piscataqua, yet the inhabitants had lost none of&#xD;
the peculiar traits that distinguished the puritan character~,-&#xD;
Their patient perseverance, their quaint garb and godly&#xD;
modes of speech, and their unshaken confidence in an over-&#xD;
ruling Providence and his blessing on their cause, were&#xD;
worthy even of the "Mayflower."&#xD;
Indeed, there were still living in their nddst gray-headed&#xD;
old men, who remembered well the falling of the first tree,&#xD;
and the site of the first hut; men who could tell fearful tales&#xD;
of the wanderings of the company through the pathless&#xD;
forest in search of the gleaming. river, and who remembered,&#xD;
also, that discreet aud-. godly man, Francis Williams, t2he&#xD;
first colonial governor, and did not fail to contrast, in no&#xD;
silken phrases, the arbitrary proceedings of the royal gov-&#xD;
ernor with hi~ wise and just measures.&#xD;
But, ardent as was their love of liberty, and keenly as&#xD;
they felt every new aggression upon their rights, they kept&#xD;
the law ever upon their side. In spite of imprisonment, they&#xD;
renionstrated firmly and respectfully with their rulers; but&#xD;
there was no open outbreak no popular riot; foi'~ Puritan-&#xD;
isin had little 'sympathy with mobs. But their prayers were&#xD;
marked with greater earnestness, and, perhaps, duration, and&#xD;
there was a general tendency to wait and se6 what the Lord&#xD;
would do for them in the matter.&#xD;
But, when the governor began to attack and suppress their&#xD;
religious liberties, one deep, indignant throb passed through&#xD;
the heart of the whole people. But the rulers heeded it not,&#xD;
and soon came an order requiring them, on pain of his Maj-&#xD;

esty's displeasure, to abstain from all manual labor on the&#xD;
approaching Christmas, and to observe the fasts of the estab-&#xD;
lished church. Silent, but strong, ~- resistless as the mighty&#xD;
under-current of the. ooean, ~Welled the ~spirit of opposition&#xD;
in every heart, and many an ohi veteran of the common-&#xD;
~reaIth and the Indian wars glanced grimly at his brightly-&#xD;
polished musket, with the thought that he was not yet too&#xD;
old to strike a blow for freedom.&#xD;
Such was the state of affairs, and such the feeling with&#xD;
which the colonists greeted the Christmas of 1684. For&#xD;
several weeks the snow had lain deep .on the earth, and the&#xD;
well4rodden paths had grown hard and smooth as marble. It&#xD;
had been a prosperous and busy season with the people, both&#xD;
on the land and sea, and, had there not been a principle at&#xD;
stake, they could well have afforded to r6st one day at the&#xD;
call of their chief magistrate. iBut to them it seemed a con-&#xD;
cession to Anti~Christ - a crossing of hands with the woman&#xD;
clothed in scarlet; and more than one face was turned anx-&#xD;
iously towards the heavens on Christmas eve, not to seek for&#xD;
the star in the east, but to' watch the progress of a storm of&#xD;
sleet and rain which had set in, and which they felt might,&#xD;
if it continued, compel them to yield, iii appearance, at least,&#xD;
to the governor's mandate. But, as if in answer to their&#xD;
prayers, the morning broke clear, serene and cold. Long be-&#xD;
fore the, low, continuous dropping from the ice-bound trees&#xD;
and shrubs~ attested the power of the sun, their farm~yards&#xD;
were full of the shows of life and labor. The measured beat&#xD;
of the flail and the flax-brake, the ringing stroke of the axe&#xD;
at the wood-pile, keeping time with those in the woods,&#xD;
echoed far and wide through the clear air, while the long&#xD;
teams of oxen, attached to the 'clumsy sleds that passed the&#xD;
governor's mansion, and the quick, determined tones of the&#xD;
drivers, might have taught one even less versed in the knowl-&#xD;
edge of men and things than Governor Cranfield, something&#xD;
of the spirit of the people with whom he had to deal.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mason and Randolph were hoth guests at the governor's&#xD;
mansion at that time - the latter holding the office of eol-&#xD;
lector, surveyor and searcher of the customs throughout New&#xD;
England, in which capacity his. arbitrary proceedings excited&#xD;
universal contempt and distrust.&#xD;
Whatever the governor might have felt at the utter &amp;amp;~on-&#xD;
tempt with ~hich his commands were treated, he was too&#xD;
much of a ~courtier to disturb' the festivities of the day by&#xD;
any display of his chagrin. He therefore listened to the in-,&#xD;
dignant remarks of his guests, and the somewhat cutting&#xD;
jests of Randolph, with an air of moderation, though the lat-&#xD;
ter was~ too well read in the human heart, not to perceive&#xD;
that his end was gained, that this assumed tone of modera-&#xD;
tion was but the prelude to stronger and more stringent&#xD;
measures towards 'a people whom he both despised and hated.&#xD;
The great dining-room of the governor's mansion, or Prov-&#xD;
ince House, as it was sometimes termed; presented a gay&#xD;
and brilliant scene on that same Christmas day; and, could&#xD;
those old Puritans have caught one glimpse, from under&#xD;
their steeple-crowned hats, of the rich festoons of evergreens&#xD;
which decked the walls (a custom held in utter abhorrence&#xD;
by them, as savoring strongly of the idolatry that caused&#xD;
Jsr.ael to sin under every green tree), and the noble ladies&#xD;
and gay cavaliers who, in the rich costume of the day,&#xD;
thronged the dinner-table - could they have listened, but&#xD;
for' one moment, to the light jests, the courtly phrases, the&#xD;
flippant witticisms and ridiculous caricatures of their own&#xD;
speech and manners - they might have had some reasonable&#xD;
doubt, especially after the ladies had withdrawn, as to&#xD;
whether it was indeed a Christian festival, or a sacrifice to&#xD;
not exactly Baal, but Bacchus.&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
Perhaps there is nothing more indicative of the character&#xD;
of a people than their architecture. This was peculiarly true&#xD;
of the Puritans. Strength and endurance were among their&#xD;
chief characteristics, and of these qualities their buildings&#xD;
largely partook. There was none of that jumbling together&#xD;
of different ideas and orders, which makes so many of our&#xD;
modern buildings, especially those in country towns, look so&#xD;
much like the cob-houses we were wont to build in our child-&#xD;
hood; but there was that same~ significant, independent, self-&#xD;
sustained air about them, that we see looking out from the&#xD;
portraits of the old worthies of that day.&#xD;
The house of Mr. Moody, that "godly man" who for&#xD;
many years "illuminated" the church of Portsmouth, was an&#xD;
illustration of these 'remarks. It stood in an ample yard,&#xD;
the rear of which was planted with young fruit trees, bearing&#xD;
names whose very sound brought with them, the memory of&#xD;
Old England. Over this yard the white snow lay in a broad&#xD;
unbroken sheet, save where three or four paths, in the dire'c-&#xD;
tion of the barn, crossed and re-crossed each other like dark&#xD;
threads, and where one, several feet broad, led from the front&#xD;
door to the gate, near which rose an oak of enormous girth,&#xD;
one of the primeval children of the forest; for even the old-&#xD;
est settler did not remember the time when the. lightning had&#xD;
blighted its top, and raised those wide, dark seams in its&#xD;
trunk. But the heart of the old giant was still sound, and&#xD;
from the huge bole had risen limbs of a girth and height that&#xD;
might well shame the growth of our own days. On each&#xD;
side of this brave old tree stood a noble specimen of.- we&#xD;
were about to say, the American plane-tree; but let us call&#xD;
them by the good old names by which we have known them&#xD;
from infancy-, buttonwood. Tall, erect, and symmetrical,&#xD;
their scarred and mottled coats giving evidence of many a wild&#xD;
&#xD;
struggle with the elements, they stood, rustling a few with~&#xD;
ered leaves, like a banner of defiance in the wind, meet sup-&#xD;
porters of the hoary monarch. We have been somewhat par-&#xD;
ticular in describing these trees, because, in the out-of-door&#xD;
life which, partly from necessity, and partly from a kind of&#xD;
natural vagabondism, we have led among the New England&#xD;
hills, we have learned to love their whole race, and many a&#xD;
kindly deed have 'they done for us, both in sunshine and in&#xD;
storm; and, aside from these, we cannot say much for the&#xD;
embellishments of parson' Moody's yard. Doubtless, the tutfl&#xD;
was thickly sown with buttercups, dandelions, and daisies,&#xD;
through the golden summer; and, even in that bleak Decem-&#xD;
ber of which we speak, there were some faint indications&#xD;
*     there that went to show that somehow, in that roomy old&#xD;
mansion, the spirit of beauty had found shelter; for the&#xD;
*     gnarled branches of a native grape were twisted like serpents&#xD;
around and above the uncouth porch, and the withered ten-&#xD;
drils of the morning-glory, that most home-like of all flowers,&#xD;
still hung swaying from the' strings that had trained them&#xD;
over the windows. And, surely, no more fitting home could&#xD;
it have found than in the heart of gentle Sibyl Moody. She&#xD;
was the minister's only child; for one sorrowful nighf the&#xD;
angels, of life and death had met beneath his roof, and,&#xD;
within the same hour, the one to~k from him a beloved wife,&#xD;
and the other laid in his arms a motherless infant.&#xD;
Mr. Moody had been sternly educated in a stern schooL&#xD;
The tenets of his faith, notwithstanding their high spiritual'&#xD;
aims, were, as generally understooil and taught, little calen..&#xD;
lated to develop the gentler qualities of the heart; such&#xD;
development being looked upon by those men of iron natures&#xD;
as a weakness little ~befitting those who had "a great work in&#xD;
hand." Therefore, if he manifested in his younger days more&#xD;
of the zeal of Peter than the gentleness of John, it is not&#xD;
surprising. Late in life he ha4 married a gentlewoman&#xD;
many years younger than himself. ~he was one of that class&#xD;

&#xD;
of women with whom love seems a necessity of their natures;&#xD;
whose affections spontaneously, as it were, cling round some&#xD;
one or some thing, without any very clear recognition of that&#xD;
stern law of reciprocity so binding upon most of us. With&#xD;
her, it was, indeed, "more blessed to give than to receive;"&#xD;
and for a few short years s~he walked by his side, looking up&#xD;
to him with mingled love and awe, happy in the thought that&#xD;
she was permitted to minister to the eomf~rt of so worthy a&#xD;
man, dreaming little of the wealth of deep, earnest feeling&#xD;
that slept beneath his calm, severe exterior. But it is not&#xD;
to his victims alone that death unveils mysteries. He has&#xD;
lessons for the living, also; and when his shadowy presence&#xD;
darkened so suddenly the minister's dwelling, the miracle of&#xD;
the desert was repeated -..-.. from that hitherto calm, self-sus-&#xD;
tained heart welled up to the light a fountain of pure and&#xD;
earnest love. Then it was that his dead wife became&#xD;
truly united to him heart and soul, and from out her grave&#xD;
sprang joy and hope, inexpressibly tender, such as he had&#xD;
never . known before, and which he~ felt were for eternity.&#xD;
From that hour the zeal of the Puritan became tempered by&#xD;
the divine spirit of love.&#xD;
In this atmosphere of chastened love and faith, Sibyl Moo-&#xD;
dy had grown up to early womanhood. Her father had&#xD;
watched over her with a mother's care and love; she had~&#xD;
been his constant companion, hnd he had developed, guided,&#xD;
and trained her rich genial nature, until it had the free grace&#xD;
and symmetry of a young tree of the forest. Bier fhce was&#xD;
otie of those which in a crowd might easily be overlooked, or&#xD;
~et down as passing fair; but to childhood and old age it&#xD;
was exceedingly beautiful, possibly, because the one was still&#xD;
blessed with faint recollections, and the other with dim fore-&#xD;
shadowings, of the bright denizens of their eternal home.&#xD;
One man-servant and Lament Collins, or Aunt Menta, as&#xD;
she was usually called, made up the minister's household; the&#xD;
latter being housekeeper, as well ~s maid"of-all-work, and, we&#xD;
&#xD;
might add, nurse, watcher, and Aoctress-general for the whole&#xD;
settlement. Moreover, we take this occasion to say that her&#xD;
name, like a great many others, was a decided misnomer, for&#xD;
never was a more cheerful or contented being than this same&#xD;
herb.gathering. syrup-making, salve-concocting old woman.&#xD;
Like a great many other excellent souls of her day, she&#xD;
had a great horror of any leaning to the forms of Episcopacy,&#xD;
and, firmly believing that " c'est le premier pas qui coute," she&#xD;
had plied her wheel to such good purpose on the aforesaid&#xD;
Christmas day, that nearly twice the number of knots allotted.&#xD;
as a day's work had beenreeled long before night, and added&#xD;
to the goodly bunch of yarn that graced the wall of the old&#xD;
sitting-room.&#xD;
Whether Sibyl had meant to give the old dame a quiet&#xD;
lesson in Christmas tolerance, or whether she had been day-&#xD;
dreaming (for no one can convince us that those fair shapes&#xD;
that blessed our fathers' households were not' sometimes dream-&#xD;
ers like ourselves, for woman's heart beat under those prim&#xD;
bodices, and woman's love looked forth from beneath those&#xD;
puritanic caps and bonnets), we cannot say; but, for some&#xD;
reason, Aunt Menta's last spool was reeled, while hers stiU&#xD;
lacked many notches of being full. With her clear~ eyes&#xD;
glancing occasionally from her thread to the hour-glass on&#xD;
the table, and from thence towards the declining sun, she&#xD;
busily plied her wheel, while Aunt Menta glided here and&#xD;
there, with the velocity and something of the look of a blue&#xD;
dragon-fly, for night was approaching, a puritan Saturday&#xD;
night, when all secular business, instead of being crowded&#xD;
into the last hours of the week, and, perchance, Sunday&#xD;
morning, as is often the case now, was laid aside long before&#xD;
sunset, and each soul left free to commune with itself~ and its&#xD;
Perhaps, of all the customs that have had an influence in&#xD;
the formation of that peculiar character that makes us New&#xD;
Englanders a marked people wherever we go, none has been&#xD;

&#xD;
more lasting or important than this same habit of "keeping&#xD;
Saturday night."&#xD;
Though no watcher among the tombs, no worshipper of&#xD;
"linen grave-clothes," rather than the risen, glorified spirit,&#xD;
we coiifess that we see with regret this old custom yielding&#xD;
to the innovations ~f a new age. Not that we consider one&#xD;
night more holy than another, all time being God's; but it&#xD;
came to check the current of worldliness, it gathered the fam-&#xD;
ily beneath the paternal roof, it brought an opportunity for&#xD;
undisturbed reflection and that self'communion so necessary&#xD;
to anything like a true estimate of life and life's ends. It is&#xD;
becoming quite the fashion to speak contemptuously and lightly&#xD;
of these old mile-stones which our fathers erected on the way of&#xD;
life, yet they have still a significance for ~is, wouldwe but read it.&#xD;
Sibyl's task was completed, the tea-table, with the stand-&#xD;
ing puritanic Saturday-night dish, baked pork and beans, was&#xD;
drawn in front of the blazing fire, when Mr. Moody, acc&amp;amp;m-&#xD;
panied by' one of the elders of his church, who had been&#xD;
closeted in his study with him for a long time, entered the&#xD;
room. Their faces were unusually grave, that of the min-&#xD;
ister even sad, as he observed, in reply to a remark of the&#xD;
elder:&#xD;
"Verily, the day of our sore visitation is not yet passed,&#xD;
for the prince of evil never wearieth of devices, and our&#xD;
enemies are basy, both here and at home. The future&#xD;
looketh dark, and our hearts might well faint, were it not&#xD;
for the blessed assurance that God still reigns. And, as -we&#xD;
would approve ourselves 'to Him rather than man, so must&#xD;
we judge in this matter of our offending brothers."&#xD;
While the minister spoke, Aunt Menta was standing by&#xD;
the window in an attitude of reverent attention; but it must&#xD;
be confessed that the good dame's eyes wandered more than&#xD;
once to the opposite side of the common, along which a train&#xD;
of clumsy but highly ornamented sleighs, or pungs, as they&#xD;
were then termed, were passing at a furious rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
The younger and gayer portion of the governor's~ guests&#xD;
were settling their dinner by a ride, and their rapid driving&#xD;
and merry laughter, as they passed through the ~streets, were&#xD;
sadly at variance with puritanic notions pf propriety. As&#xD;
Mr. Moody ceased speaking, a loud cry from the old dame&#xD;
cut short the elder's reply, and drew them all to the ~window.&#xD;
Directly in front of the house the whole train had' come to a9&#xD;
stand. Some part of the harness' attached to the governor's&#xD;
sleigh had given way, and the spirited horses, so suddenly&#xD;
checked in their mad career, were with difficulty held in by the.&#xD;
driver, while their struggles to free themselves were frightful.&#xD;
The occupants of the sleigh, among whom were several&#xD;
ladies, seemed for a moment paralyzed. Then~ the gentlemen&#xD;
sprang to the assistance of the driver, and being joined by&#xD;
several of their companions, the horses were soon disen-&#xD;
tangled, and by the aid of Mr. Moods man, 'John, the&#xD;
broken harness repaired. Sibyl, in her terror for the young&#xD;
beings in the sleigh, had stood with clasped hands, leaning&#xD;
against the window-frame, watching intently the movements&#xD;
of the frightened horses, unmindful of the admiring gaze of a&#xD;
lady who occupied a sleigh directly in front of the window.&#xD;
She did not hear the lady's words of admiration, or see her&#xD;
touch her cavalier's arm and draw his attention from his im.&#xD;
patient horse to herself; but she turned just in time to c~tch a&#xD;
glimpse of a wdll~known face and beaming smile, which Sent&#xD;
the blood rushing to her very temples.&#xD;
"Frederic Vane, as true as I live!" exclaimed Aunt 'Menta,&#xD;
who had also caught a glimpse of the face, using her ~strong-&#xD;
est form of affirmation.&#xD;
"Frederic Vane," repeated the minister; "you must be&#xD;
mistaken, Nenta. The youth still. tarrieth in England '~&#xD;
"Nay, I believe she speaketh truly, reverend sir. I met&#xD;
the youth of whom you speak in the hall of the governor's&#xD;
house yesterday, as I returned from my fruitless interview&#xD;
with him," said Elder Hale.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Indeed!" replied Mr. Moody, while, for a moment, the sad,&#xD;
grave expression of his features relaxed into something like a&#xD;
smile; "perhaps he hath already grown weary of the world's&#xD;
vanities - wealth, honor and ambition - aiid returned to&#xD;
seek a truer happiness here; for the youth was well taught,&#xD;
and by no means ignorant of the things which pertain to&#xD;
man's highest good. iDidst thou learn what brought him to&#xD;
the province again?"&#xD;
"lie came as escort to the governor's ward, - Eleanor&#xD;
Meredith, I think they call her, - to whom men say he is&#xD;
betrothed in marriage."&#xD;
"Ah, is it so?" said the old minister, sadly. "He often&#xD;
spoke, when with us, of having his fortune to carve out, for-&#xD;
getting, after the manner of men, that, though man proposes,&#xD;
God disposes. Yet there was much that was noble in him -&#xD;
much that spoke to our earthly affections; and I grieve," he&#xD;
continued, earnestly, "I deeply grieve to hear that he has&#xD;
chosen his lot among our oppressors. But the power of the&#xD;
world is very strong!"&#xD;
"Who says it? who says it?" whispered Sibyl, suddenly&#xD;
laying her hand upon the elder's arm.&#xD;
The words and manner, so unexpected and so unusual from&#xD;
her, caused both the old men to start.&#xD;
"My child! my Sihyl!" exclaimed her father, anxiously,&#xD;
as he caught a view of her white cheek, "you are ill. Some&#xD;
water, Menta," he continued, folding his arm about her for a&#xD;
support. "This fright has been too much for you."&#xD;
"Nay, I am better, my father' she said; "but you have&#xD;
not replied to my question, Father Hale."&#xD;
"0, it was only the vain gossip I was compelled to hear,&#xD;
at the Province House, while waiting to see the governor.&#xD;
Doubtless you will soon be better informed by the youth him-.&#xD;
self. But I fear you are little better than a coward, to be so&#xD;
Lightened at those horses, for all you have grown into such a&#xD;
tall girl," returned the grim elder, with the nearest approach&#xD;
&#xD;
to a smile that he was ever known to be guilty of on Satur-&#xD;
day after twelve o'clock.&#xD;
The evening meal was over, thQ chapter read, and the fer-&#xD;
vent prayer offered, at a much earlier hour in the minister's&#xD;
dwelling than usual, that night, for the thick-gathering troubles&#xD;
of his people weighed heavily upon the old man's spirit, and&#xD;
he would be alone with his God.&#xD;
"My child," he said, as he laid his hand upon her head i~&#xD;
blessing, "you are not looking quite well, and had best seek&#xD;
repose."&#xD;
Her room adjoined his own, and could he hav~e seen her an&#xD;
hour later, as she knelt there, pressing a richly-chased locket,&#xD;
with its heavy lock of dark hair, to her lips - could he have&#xD;
caught the murmured words, "lie false! he wed the govern-&#xD;
or's ward! 0, they do not know him; they cannot know&#xD;
him as I do! "- he would at least have made a discovery&#xD;
which, in the usual routine of their daily life, he seemed likely&#xD;
never to make. He would have felt that his eh~ld was a&#xD;
woman - a woman in thought and feeling, with the strongest&#xD;
links in her chain of destiny already~ forged and pressing upon&#xD;
her heart.&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
Some months previous to Governor Cranfield's arrival in&#xD;
the province,, a young man, bearing the name of iirederio&#xD;
Vane, had arrived at Portsmouth from the colony of New&#xD;
York, with private letters of importance for that gentleman.&#xD;
As the governor was not expected to arrive until October,&#xD;
and the mansion chosen for his residence was undergoing ex-&#xD;
tensive alterations, the youth took up his quarters at the&#xD;
principal inn. The settlement suffered much from an epidemic&#xD;
fever that season, and, among others, the landlord and the&#xD;
young stranger were both seized with it. As was then the&#xD;

&#xD;
custom, the minister and his family were everywhere among&#xD;
the sufferers, not only to sympathize and advise, but to kelp.&#xD;
Mr. Moody, seeing that both the patients could not have&#xD;
the necessary care bestowed upon them at the inn, had the&#xD;
oung stranger removed to his own house. As was usual&#xD;
with the members of his profession at that time, he possessed&#xD;
considerable knowledge of medicine, and, aided by the excel-&#xD;
lent nursing of Aunt Menta, to say nothing of her wonderful&#xD;
syrups, prepared after a recipe given to her sainted mother&#xD;
by one of the Bourchier family,, and used in the family of the&#xD;
Lord Protector himself, according to the good dame, together&#xD;
with the gentle ministry of Sibyl, what wonder, the crisis&#xD;
once passed, that the youth ~grew rapidly convalescent? What&#xD;
wonder that the gentle stranger - so patient in his illness, so&#xD;
eloquent in his gratitude grew as rapidly dear to the min-&#xD;
ister's family?&#xD;
Mr. Moody was a scholar, a graduate of one of England's&#xD;
universities. The members of his flock were men of sound&#xD;
sense and respectable attainments, but they cared little for&#xD;
the classic lore of the schools; therefore, the good man the&#xD;
more keenly enjoyed this daily intercourse with a mind so well&#xD;
cultured, so ingenuous, so full of noble aspirations, as that of&#xD;
his young friend and guest.&#xD;
Ill, a stranger in a strange land, this was, as, thank Heaven,&#xD;
it ever has been with woman, sufficient reason for the interest&#xD;
with which Aunt Menta and Sibyl watched over him. But,&#xD;
as the Weeks went on, and the flush of health deepened on his&#xD;
cheek and lit up his proud, dark eyes, was it still only this that&#xD;
gave the sudden impetus to the young blood of the maiden at&#xD;
the sound of his step, and sent it, blushing like a rosy dawn,&#xD;
over neck and cheek whenever he stole upon her unawares?&#xD;
Or, as he read, with his clear, low voice and distinct enun-&#xD;
ciation, those works which bear fruit for all time the glo.&#xD;
rious essays of John Milton - to the delighted old minister,&#xD;
was it mere gratitude, and nothing moire, that led him, at each&#xD;
&#xD;
divine truth and sublime thought, to invariably turn to her,&#xD;
as if' he sought to gather from her sweet face a double harvest&#xD;
of pleasure?&#xD;
So they thought; and, perhaps, the whole experience of&#xD;
life does not contain hours of purer, more unalloyed happi~&#xD;
ness, than this unconscious growth of love, this slow unfolding&#xD;
of the heart's flower, ere passion hath breathed upon its leaves&#xD;
for fruition or decay.&#xD;
But we cannot dream forever, and the hours, which linger&#xD;
only in, the presence of sorrow, soon brought the awakening.&#xD;
The business which had brought him to Portsmouth was&#xD;
arranged, and on the evening which preceded his departure&#xD;
fbr England, Sibyl and he found themselves alone in the Lrge&#xD;
old sitting-room of the parsonage. The n~inister had been&#xD;
~uddcnly called forth on ~ome errazid of mercy, and Aunt&#xD;
Menta was still busy with her household labors in the kitchen.&#xD;
The night was dark and blustering, but a bright fire blazed in&#xD;
the wide fireplace, giving a cheerful aspect to the room, near&#xD;
which sat Sibyl, gazing intently at the glowing embers, while&#xD;
Frederic Vane paced restlessly the oaken floor.&#xD;
The maiden started suddenly, as a gust of wind dxove a&#xD;
shower of heavy raindrops against the window, and, turning&#xD;
her sorrowful fhce towards him, said, eagerly,&#xD;
"Hear you that, Frederic? The 'Adventure 'will not ~4l&#xD;
to-morrow. You will stay with us another day; perhaps&#xD;
another week."&#xD;
"Sybil," said the young man, suddenly pausing before her,&#xD;
and taking both her hands in his, "you will never forget&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
"Forget you! you, my brother!" said the young-girl,&#xD;
raising her tear-dimmed eyes to his face.&#xD;
"Brother!" repeated he, impatiently. *" Do not call me&#xD;
so again."&#xD;
"And why not, Frederic? You promisedto be my brother&#xD;
always."&#xD;

&#xD;
"Because, because," he said, impatiently, "there is a love&#xD;
stronger, deeper, truer, even, than a brother's. I have heard&#xD;
of it, but now I know it - I feel it; and you, Sibyl," - he&#xD;
paused and gazed down into her eyes, until the tremulous,&#xD;
white lids drooped, and the color in her cheek went and came&#xD;
like the changeful lights in the northern sky, "you, too,&#xD;
feel and know it," he added, as he drew her~ to him with a&#xD;
glance of joy.&#xD;
For one moment her fair head rested on his breast as he&#xD;
whispered, "No, we cannot forget, dearest Sibyl. In two&#xD;
years I shall return to claim ".-.&#xD;
The quick step of Aunt Menta upon the threshold inter-&#xD;
rupted his words, but he could not fail to read aright the ex~&#xD;
pression of those bashful eyes that for one second met his, as&#xD;
she hurriedly slipped from. his arms and escaped from the&#xD;
room.&#xD;
When she returned, she found her father there, and two of&#xD;
the chief men of the town, who wished to avail themselves of&#xD;
the young man's return, to transmit letters to their friends in&#xD;
England.&#xD;
It is questionable whether, either of the young people prof.&#xD;
ited much by the sage remarks of the gentlemen, on the&#xD;
probable length of the "Adventure's" voyage, the prospect&#xD;
~f fair weather, etc.; but Id: silence only raised him in their&#xD;
esteem.&#xD;
"A very discreet and sensible youth; one who has a proper&#xD;
respect for his elders," observed Mr. Amesbury to his comm&#xD;
pauion, as they left the house.&#xD;
Mr. Moody had, indeed,, noticed the thoughtful stIence of&#xD;
his young guest, but even his heart, schooled to submission by&#xD;
many and sore trials, grew sad at the thought of parting, and&#xD;
he did not deem it strange. The slight interruption caused&#xD;
by the departure of the gentlemen had scarcely subsided, and&#xD;
the family once more gathered in silence around the hearth,&#xD;
when they were startled by a. message from the captain of the&#xD;
&#xD;
ship, saying, that as there was a prospect of fine weather, and&#xD;
the wind was getting to be fair and steady, the gentleman had&#xD;
best come on board within a half hour or so, as he should&#xD;
probably sail at flood-tide.&#xD;
His trunks were already on board; still there were bustle&#xD;
and confusion in the minister's quiet dwelling, for each of its&#xD;
members had thought of something more for his comfort.&#xD;
Then, they once more gathered in that room, and Sibyl, with&#xD;
the self-restraint peculiar to her puritan training, forced back&#xD;
her sobs, while her father'~ low voice rose in fervent petitions&#xD;
for Heaven's blessing upon their young friend in all his&#xD;
wanderings. Then the young maD's head was bowed to&#xD;
receive his blessing. Aunt Menta's good wishes, responded to,&#xD;
and repeated directions concerning his health' listened to,&#xD;
with due respect, he turned to Sibyl. For some seconds he&#xD;
pressed her hands in silence, while his lips trembled as he&#xD;
gazed into her tearful eyes. "God bless you, Sibyl! You&#xD;
will not forget," he murmured, at length.&#xD;
"The child will not be likely to do that," replied the old&#xD;
man, with a smile. "We shall all miss you much, my son,&#xD;
and think of you often with prayers.&#xD;
"But she should have something to remind her of me," he&#xD;
said, taking from his own neck a locket attached to a. light&#xD;
gold chain. "You will permit her to wear this for my sake,&#xD;
dear sir; nor will she prize it the less because it was the gift&#xD;
of my only sister."&#xD;
The old man smiled, as he replied, "Be it so. Youth&#xD;
seeks to remember, old age to forget. Such is life, my chil-&#xD;
dren."&#xD;
The maiden bent her head while the young man threw the&#xD;
light chain over her neck, and her cheek glQwed like the rose&#xD;
when she again lifted it, for she saw that the light hair of the&#xD;
sister, which she had often seen within the locket, had given&#xD;
place to a lock of a darker hue.&#xD;

104        IJIAYES FROM ~EUE TREE IODRASYL.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
On the day ~ncceeding ~hristma~, the congregation of the&#xD;
faithful, in the town of Portsmouth, came up to the house of&#xD;
the Lord with countenances unusually grave and severe, for&#xD;
one of their own number had fallen into grievous sin, and,&#xD;
moreover, the arbitrary proceedings of Governor Cranfield&#xD;
weighed heavily upon their hearts. Yet a gleam of stern joy&#xD;
lit up more than one face at the thought of the quiet yet&#xD;
~     decided rebuke conveyed in the conduct of the people on the&#xD;
preceding day; and the light of eternal truth which they did&#xD;
hold, though oftentimes warped and perverted by human ertor,&#xD;
never shone more brightly than on that day, darkened as it&#xD;
was by the shadow of future trouble.&#xD;
The service for the day was over when the minister proceeded&#xD;
to lay before the church the case of John iDenney, a member,&#xD;
charged with perjury. He stated the case in detail; but it is&#xD;
sufficient for us to say, that this Denney was the owner of 'a&#xD;
vessel which had been seized by Randolph, on plea of defraud-&#xD;
ing the revenue. Her master, however, found means to elude&#xD;
the vigilance of his agents, and one morning she was missing&#xD;
from the harbor. Her owner protested that he knew nothing&#xD;
of the affair, but, upon his trial, there appeared abundant tes-&#xD;
timony 'to the contrary. He soon found the means to com-&#xD;
pound the matter with the governor and Randolph, but the&#xD;
church, of which he had long been a member, were not so&#xD;
easily satisfied.&#xD;
Mr. Moody, though he knew he was particularly obnoxious&#xD;
to the governor and his party, on account of the plainness and&#xD;
freedom of his speech, shrank from no trial in* the way of&#xD;
duty. He felt that the purity of his church was at stake,&#xD;
and addressed a respectful note to the governor, requesting a&#xD;
copy of the evidence against IDenney, that he might be tried&#xD;
aceordiug to their ecclesiasticall discipline. The g~yernor had&#xD;
replied, and, upon this letter, Mr. Moody particularly wished&#xD;

for the opinion and counsel of the brethren. He~j~41i4&#xD;
read it in a firm, unfaltering voice, and with an undisturb&amp;amp;I&#xD;
countenance, though the faces around him grew dark wrth in-&#xD;
dignation. Thus ran the missive:&#xD;
"We ourselves have pardoned the man, and those to whim&#xD;
we see fit to extend our mercy are not to be questioned by&#xD;
any self-constituted authority; therefore, molest him at your&#xD;
peril."&#xD;
"My brethren," resumed the old man, after a pause of&#xD;
some seconds, "when, in my early manhood, I dedicated my~&#xD;
self to the service of God, to break the bread of life to his&#xD;
scattered and suffering people, I cast from me all fear of&#xD;
bodily peril, and have ever striven to act in all things with a&#xD;
single eye to God's glory. Therefore, I have but one answer&#xD;
to make to this man whom the majesty of England hath set to&#xD;
rule, over us.' Ye have heard his words, my brethren; and it&#xD;
is reserved unto you to say whether this church, gathered&#xD;
amid suffering and trouble, and nurtured with so many prayers&#xD;
and tears, shall serve God or man. Let such as fear Him,&#xD;
rather than man, arise!"&#xD;
The congregation rose to a man, and the minister looked&#xD;
down on a crowd of faces, toil-worn, seamed, and scarred&#xD;
by many a battle with both temporal and spiritual foes, in&#xD;
many cases pale and haggard from illness, but firm and undi~~.&#xD;
inayed, ready to strengthen his hands, even as Aaron and 4&#xD;
Hur strengthened the hands of Moses in the battle of the&#xD;
*Then followed a unanimous vote to notify the offending&#xD;
brother that his trial would take place on the ensuing week,&#xD;
and a 'committee was appointed to visit him once more, t&amp;amp;&#xD;
urge upon him the duty of confession.&#xD;
It was the wish of the brethren that the old minister should&#xD;
prepare a sermon upon false swearing for the ensuing Sabbath;&#xD;
and, while b~ was very busy in his study, l~ow ~ped the time&#xD;

* hted by hope, although, but by that one glance of&#xD;
~n, Frederic Vane had not as yet manifested a knowl-&#xD;
~ ~f1ier existence, yet, like all her sex, her ir~vention in&#xD;
providing excuses for the being she loved, was inexhaustible.&#xD;
A dark tempest was gathering over her own and her old&#xD;
father's head, while she, in her unsuspecting truth and in-&#xD;
nocence, lived on in hope and trust.&#xD;
Before another Sabbath, John iDenney, touched by the&#xD;
earnest prayers and expostulations of his brethren, came be-&#xD;
fore them, and made ample confession of his guilt, and, with&#xD;
fitting censure, was forgiven. Ii~ would be difficult to describe&#xD;
the anger and mortification of the royal governor when he&#xD;
heard of these proceedings. His occasional outbursts were&#xD;
the more frightful from the strong self.cor~trol which he was&#xD;
obliged to place upon himself in the presence of his guests,&#xD;
many of whom were spending the holidays with him. Ran-&#xD;
dolph, whose interest in ,the matter was quite equal to, the&#xD;
governor's, seemed to forget his own anger in the malicious&#xD;
pleasure he took in probing that of the latter.&#xD;
One evening, after the ladies had withdrawn, and the gen-&#xD;
tlemen, some six or eight in number, still lingered around the&#xD;
dinner-table, he arose, and, as if in reply to some gay remark&#xD;
of his vis4t-vis, cried, jestingly;&#xD;
"Hear! 0, noble gentlemen, hear! William de Graiville,&#xD;
gentleman, of Sussex, England, hath fairly won ten guineas&#xD;
of me, Edward Randolph-.~-- a wager between us in the case&#xD;
of the King versus Fanaticism; and, certes, gentlemen, his&#xD;
majesty may well look grave, when his royal authority, vested&#xD;
in the person of our excellent host here, is thus trampled'upon&#xD;
by a crop-eared, psalm-singing knave, unless, indeed," he&#xD;
added, with a laugh, "the merrier monarch be more inclined&#xD;
to consider the, crestfallen condition of our puissant selves, as&#xD;
an especial provocation to mirth, which I think the most&#xD;
likely."&#xD;
"Then, by the Lord that liveth!" exclaimed the governor,&#xD;
&#xD;
A TALE OF TUB COWN~ TIMES.          107&#xD;
in a burst of ungovernable anger, "his majesty w~W~!&amp;amp;~&#xD;
only one who will care to laugh twice, at least where ~axd&#xD;
Cranfield is concerned. As for this ~old priest, he shall~oon&#xD;
find that he is not in heaven, saint though he daim to be. I&#xD;
will put him where his treasonable discourses will find fewer&#xD;
listeners! "&#xD;
For a moment deep silence followed this speech, for they&#xD;
felt that his excellence was in no mood for joking. Then&#xD;
one of the eldest of hi~ guests, whose moderate counsels had&#xD;
often saved him from rash deeds, remarked:&#xD;
"But we must not forget that this Puritan is also an Eng-&#xD;
4      lishman. We must prove his treason before we punish him."&#xD;
"0, that is easily enough done!" said one of the younger&#xD;
guests. "Here is Vane, who spent some months at his house~.&#xD;
He can give us proof by the bushel, I dare say."&#xD;
"Yes, speak out, Vane. What treasonable homilies did&#xD;
* old Crop-ear preach to you?" cried another, laughing.&#xD;
"And so betray the man to whom, perhaps, II owe my life.&#xD;
Never! even were he guilty of the charge," replied the young&#xD;
man, rising, while his beautiful mouth, in which there was a&#xD;
singular blending of strength and indecision, grew rigid with&#xD;
indignant scorn. "And, believe me, gentlemen," he added,&#xD;
more calmly, "Mr. Moody, when I knew him, was a kind, well-&#xD;
educated, generous-hearted man, though deeply imbued i~h&#xD;
the spirit of his faith, IL grant. He spoke to me openly, as if&#xD;
I had been his own son, and, during my whole stay under his&#xD;
roof, IL heard nothing which could be construed into treason&#xD;
against his majesty or the realm."&#xD;
"Perhaps, among his gifts, he had that of prophecy also,&#xD;
and foresaw that th&amp;amp;day might come when you w~uld really&#xD;
stand in1~hat filial relation to him. 'T is said t~ti~ old man&#xD;

"By the mass, iDarcy, your shaft has hit home," cried de&#xD;

er~ot~gli tQ be worth the trouble of winning. I give' you fair&#xD;
warning'that I am going to enter the lists with you; but re-&#xD;

to-day; and Randolph's ten guineas to a crown-piece that I&#xD;
succeed, notwithstanding your advantage of' previous acquaint-&#xD;
ance. Your saints are never quite sound at the core."&#xD;
"Rascal!" exclaimed Vane, choking with indignation, as&#xD;
he ~uimed a wine-glass at de Graiville's head. But his arm&#xD;
was suddenly caught back, and the voice of the gentleman&#xD;
who a few moments before had sought to moderate the gov-&#xD;
ernor's anger, whispered in his ear, as he drew him aside, -&#xD;
"Rash blood, rash blood, young man.; though I grant you&#xD;
had just cause."&#xD;
For some moments the room was in confusion, when the&#xD;
governor, as the shortest way of settling a temporary peace,&#xD;
proposed adjourning to the drawing-room. But the syren&#xD;
tones and marked preference of the honorable Eleanor Mere-&#xD;
dith had lost their fascination for Frederic Vane that evening.&#xD;
His mind, for some weeks occuj~ied by her, was now thor-&#xD;
oughly roused, and his thoughts busy wiLk the past.&#xD;
Hitherto, we have said little of young Vane's personal&#xD;
appearance, and, perhaps, we may as well briefly describe it,&#xD;
inasmuch as it was a fair index to his character. His face&#xD;
W~s just such an one as ever wins the love of young and trust-&#xD;
ii~ hearts, full of rich, sensuous beauty;. that peculiar&#xD;
moulding of feature and expression which, by self-culture and&#xD;
careful training, may be developed into the noblest form of&#xD;
manly beauty, or, by indolence and self-excess, degenerate into&#xD;
mere sensualism. There was no lack of intellect; and, with&#xD;
the whole energy of his nature aroused by the events of the&#xD;
evening, j~rhaps he never looked more wortVy~of admiration&#xD;
than on the night of which we speak, as he sat in thoughtful&#xD;
silence by the side of the fair English lady.&#xD;
As he was crossing the gallery towards his Own room, late&#xD;
that night, a servant overtook him, saying that~ihe governor&#xD;
&#xD;
requested a few moments' private conversation 'with~humn, He&#xD;
turned to his excellence's private room, and met, not the&#xD;
angry, baffled ruler, hut the smooth, wishedd courtier' of the&#xD;
reign of Charles I.&#xD;
After some desultory remarks, and a graceful allusion to&#xD;
and apology for his own want of self-control at the dinner.&#xD;
table, the governor laid his hand on a pile of letters, and&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"I have had no opportunity t&amp;amp;speak to you of the contents&#xD;
of your mother's letters. She 'says that the. death of' your&#xD;
only near male relative and guardian has left me, her distant&#xD;
cousin, your natural friend and adviser, ~nd wishes me to pro.&#xD;
cure for you some situation which may be adapted to your&#xD;
talents. I am willing to do this, as much for your 'own sake a&amp;amp;'~&#xD;
hers. Your natural abilities are good, my influence at court&#xD;
not small. With such grounds to start from, it will be your&#xD;
own fault if you do not reach a high round on fame's ladder.&#xD;
Only be wary and prudent, boy, and let me hear no mere of&#xD;
such brawls as that we have just witnessed. Indeed, I much&#xD;
commend your spirit, but, as a general thing, quarrels are&#xD;
impolitic. If de Graiville challenges you, as most likely&#xD;
he will, you must meet him; but, henceforth, quarrel only&#xD;
when iL will further your ends better than peace. And," b~e&#xD;
added, smiling, "you are young and handsome marry, '~&#xD;
Methinks you had one by~ your side this evening who wo d&#xD;
not need much wooing. Add her wealth to my influence and&#xD;
your talent, and your way is clear. By Jove, boy, if you&#xD;
show one half the spirit in wooing my ward, Eleanor, that you&#xD;
did to-night in defending that old rebel, she will be yours in&#xD;
a fortnight! As t~ his daughter, let de Graiville woo her as&#xD;
he lists. It ia ~nght ~o us."&#xD;
Alas for the vanity and worldliness of the human heart!&#xD;

defiance at de ~raiville a few hours before'? Chilled by the&#xD;
cold breath of worldly wisdom, until, long before he again&#xD;

sought his own room, the gentle memory of Sibyl, which had&#xD;
been so surely drawing him back to her side during the even-&#xD;
ing hours, had faded before the fitful glare that gleamed&#xD;
from the ambitious path which the governor's words had&#xD;
opened.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
Day after day passed, and the light of hope glimmered&#xD;
fainter and fainter in the heart of Sibyl Moody. The report&#xD;
of Frederk, Vane's engagement. to the lovely English lady be-&#xD;
came current among the townspeople, and, though she seldom&#xD;
trusted her lips with his name, she could not fail to hear it.&#xD;
Gradually came the conviction that she was forgotten, and&#xD;
with it that hour of withering anguish, - that bitter struggle&#xD;
when the young heart finds, for the first time, that its cher-&#xD;
ished idols are false ~- its love and trust dishonored. It was&#xD;
a fearful trial that feeling of utter desolation that settled&#xD;
-upon her heart, congealing for a time its very life-blood. She&#xD;
met it alone, and alone she sought for strength to bear it.&#xD;
Though such struggles cannot be, and leave no trace upon the&#xD;
outward frame, her old f4her, more than usually occupied with&#xD;
the troubles of his society, happily failed to notice the growing&#xD;
p~lor of 'her cheek or the unusual lassitude of her movements.&#xD;
They did not, however, escape the watchful eye of Aunt Nenta;&#xD;
but she, kind soul, while she urged, nay, forced upon the&#xD;
maiden double doses of her syrups, could not, when 'she&#xD;
looked upon her bowed form and careworn face, bear to add to&#xD;
his anxiety.&#xD;
One evening, as the old man turned with a heavier step&#xD;
than usual toward his study door, he suddenly paused and&#xD;
gazed for some seconds anxiously on the face of his child.&#xD;
"Sibyl," he said at length, "I wish to speak with you in&#xD;
my study. Will you come?&#xD;
The glance and the words brought a deep blush to the&#xD;
&#xD;
I'&#xD;
&#xD;
maiden's cheek, as, with a mental prayer for strength to con-&#xD;
ceal her sulThring, she arose and followed him.&#xD;
Lie took his arm-chair by the table, and, leaning his head&#xD;
on his hands, sat for some time as if occupied iii ~ilent prayer,.&#xD;
while his daughter drew a low seat to his side, and, laying&#xD;
her head on his knee, as in the days of childhood, awaited&#xD;
his words.&#xD;
"Sibyl," he said, at length, passing his hand fondly over&#xD;
her hair, "thy father hath grown old and forgetful. In the&#xD;
trials and troubles with which it hath pleased Him to sur-&#xD;
round my age as well as my youth, I hav&amp;amp; forgotten that my&#xD;
child hath grown to womanhood. This day, Elder Hale hath&#xD;
reminded me of it, by asking thee in marriage for his son. He&#xD;
is a deserving youth, of a family rich' in temporal blessings,&#xD;
but richer still, IL trust, in the heavenly inheritance that&#xD;
awaiteth the servants of the Lord. What answer shall I&#xD;
make to this young man, my child?"&#xD;
"0, send me not from you! Let me live and die with you,&#xD;
my father!" cried the poor girl, burying her face in her&#xD;
hands upon his knee, while every nerve in her fair neck&#xD;
twitched convulsively in her effort to suppress her emotion.&#xD;
"I have no wish to send you from me Sibyl; but sore&#xD;
trouble, imprisonment, and perhaps death, await me. Listen,&#xD;
my child. This day the governor hath notified me that l~e~&#xD;
together with Mason and his follower Hinckes, will partake~&#xD;
of the Lord's Supper with us next Sabbath; and, moreover,&#xD;
he requireth me~ to administer it according to the forms of the&#xD;
established church, with liturgy and vain repetitions. This,&#xD;
of course, I have wholly refused to do; therefore he hath the&#xD;
pretext against me which he hath long sought. Before&#xD;
another day he may drag me to prison, and. though~.. I know&#xD;
that He will not try me beyond my strength, ye&amp;amp;the thought&#xD;
of thee, my daughter," - and, for the first time since he .com-&#xD;
inenced speaking, the old man's voice grew tremulous,&#xD;

&#xD;
"homeless and exposed~ to the snares of the spoiler, weakeneth&#xD;
my heart."&#xD;
"Father," said Sibyl, raising her head from his knee, and&#xD;
speaking very earnestly, "could you be happier separated&#xD;
from your child?"&#xD;
For a moment there was a struggle inth&amp;amp; old man's heart,&#xD;
and the rigid lines about his mouth moved convulsively as he&#xD;
exclaimed, "Tempt me not, my child! 0, tempt me not!"&#xD;
"Then we part no more. This governor is human; he&#xD;
cannot forbid the child to share her father's fate. Let that&#xD;
be what it may, I will not shrink, if so be we may meet it&#xD;
together. But speak no more," and the enthusiasm, which for&#xD;
a moment had lit up her pale face, gave place to the exptes-&#xD;
sion of bitter suffering. "0, speak no more, I entreat of you,&#xD;
of this marriage!"&#xD;
The old man bent over her, and for some moments his with-&#xD;
ered cheek rested upon her head, ere he trusted his voice in&#xD;
reply. At length he said, brokenly,&#xD;
"It was not thy love nor thy devotion that I doubted; but,"&#xD;
he added, slowly, "thou art fair, my Sibyl; thou hast thy&#xD;
mother's comely face, and I thought of my. death, and the&#xD;
power of our enemies. Yet, surely, there is one among them&#xD;
who, forgetful as he seems, would not see thee wronged. I&#xD;
aDeak of Frederic Vane."&#xD;
The quick, convulsive shudder that passed through the girl's&#xD;
frame shook even him, and for some moments he sat in bewil-&#xD;
dered surprise. Then the truth seemed suddenly to dawn upon&#xD;
him. He raised her head in his trembling old hands, and&#xD;
gazed on her pale face for some moments, while his own grew&#xD;
&amp;amp;emulous with emotion. "]~[y child, my poor child!" he&#xD;
murmured. That mournful tone was too much for Sibyl.&#xD;
~Phe self-command that she had struggled to maintain gave&#xD;
way, and, hiding her face in his bosom, she burst into tears.&#xD;
"My child, my poor, motherless child!" he murmured&#xD;
again, as he drew her closely to. his heart. "And so I cher-&#xD;
&#xD;
I :~&#xD;
&#xD;
ished a viper under my roof. Blind mole that I was, not to&#xD;
foresee this! So true and noble as he seemed. ileaveti&#xD;
knows that I cherished, yea, loved him as a son, and he -&#xD;
I will "-i---&#xD;
"Forgive him, father, even as I have forgiven him," whis-&#xD;
pered a voice in his ear.&#xD;
"But you must tell me all, Sibyl, all."&#xD;
She left~ the room, and, after a few minutes' absence, re-&#xD;
turned and placed in his hands Frederic Vane~s parting gift,.&#xD;
the locket enclosing the lock of hair. Then, kneeling at his&#xD;
side, she simply and briefly related the story of her love, while,&#xD;
with one hand laid upon her head, he gazed thoughtfully down&#xD;
upon her face.&#xD;
"So my thoughtlessness has darkened the light of thy'&#xD;
young life, my daughter, and this man weds another - the&#xD;
ward of our bitterest enemy. He was unworthy of our love,&#xD;
my Sibyl."&#xD;
"Blame him not, father. The lady is said to 'be good, -&#xD;
beautiful, I know her to be, for I saw her once; more fitting&#xD;
to be his wife than simple Sibyl Moody. Yet she can never&#xD;
love him"'- Again her hands were pressed upon her eyes,&#xD;
as if to force back the rush of tears. "'Enough, my father,"&#xD;
she added, meekly; "if I have sinned in setting up an earthly&#xD;
idol - if IL have erred in withholding this matter fro yoi~!&#xD;
have also suffered."&#xD;
"I blame you not, Sibyl. It was but natural. Hence-&#xD;
forth, we will part no 'more, and our only trust ~must be in&#xD;
Him who is both able and* willing to save. And kneeling&#xD;
down by her side, in a voice shaken with grief, the old man~&#xD;
laid his daughter's sorrows before the throne of Him whom he&#xD;
had served from his youth.&#xD;
He had not miscalculated the vengeance of the governor.&#xD;
Two weeks after, the doors of the prison closed behind them.&#xD;
flaring thirteen weary weeks they were shut away from Gad's&#xD;
sunlight and fresh air; but no royal authority could deprive&#xD;

that old man of the light of a clear conscience, and he often&#xD;
felt, that, like the saints of old, an angel ministered unto him&#xD;
under the form of his child.&#xD;
And when those heavy doors were opened~ and, nuder the&#xD;
ban of exile, he was again permitted to go forth, the angel&#xD;
was still by his side, for she did not vanish suddenly like those&#xD;
of which we read, but her cheek grew more and more white&#xD;
and transparent, her eye brighter and her step slower, until,&#xD;
with the fall of the leaves, she disappeared from his sight.&#xD;
But the old man looked upward with a calm smile, for he&#xD;
knew that in a few short days he should again look upon her&#xD;
in "those boundless regions of all perfection."&#xD;

Then they made a league with that cool-headed old tactician,&#xD;
the north wind, and together they went stirring through the&#xD;
streets, heaving up embankments here, and digging trenches&#xD;
and forming curves there, rushing round corners, to attack&#xD;
stout, rosy-checked gentlemen, who fought and sputtered and&#xD;
dashed the snow from their eyebrows, to see what awaited&#xD;
them next, while the thinly-clad~ shop-girls drew their shawls&#xD;
closer about them, and scudded in troops, like little snow-&#xD;
birds, close under the lee of the houses, to escape their bois-&#xD;
terous greetings. In the space of an hour or so the storm&#xD;
had the city pretty much to itself, for whoever had a shelter&#xD;
was glad to get beneath it, and stay there.&#xD;
On the corner of C and P streets was a spacious wholesale&#xD;
clothing stOre, upon which, in hurrying up and down the&#xD;
streets, after the last stragglers, the storm seemed to bestow&#xD;
particular attention. It tried to shake the mahogany-cased&#xD;
windows, and find some crack in them, or in the heavily pan-&#xD;
elled door, by which it could gain ingress; but, baffled here, it&#xD;
contented itself with wrapping a white covering over the gilded&#xD;
sign-board, darkening the windows, muffling the steps, and&#xD;
piling up a barricade against the door, as if it said, " Never&#xD;
~mind, I '11 be ready for' you when you do open!"&#xD;

manoAivi~es seemed to disturb the equanimity of Mr. ID.&#xD;
Orestes Jimps, the owner of the store. All the clerks had&#xD;
gone to tea; and, while waiting their return, he sat before&#xD;
the stove, with his heels resting upon a high stool, rather&#xD;
above the level of his head, and his eyes fixed upon a lamp-&#xD;
hook in the wall, as a kind of tether to his imagination, as he&#xD;
counted up the profits of the day's sales, - a very necessary&#xD;
and commendable process, seeing next day was New-year's,&#xD;
ai~d1he nntioipated several extra demands upon his purse.&#xD;
Perb~rn we should not be far from the truth, if we said that,&#xD;

shade by any one, especially by a rival house; besides, we&#xD;
are all, at times, so remarkably disinterested, that we tale&#xD;
more interest in other people's concerns than our own.&#xD;
But, hurrah! the storm has triumphed! Through the open&#xD;
door falls the barricade of snow, followed by the wind, that&#xD;
sends the glittering particles dancing through the whole length&#xD;
of the store, and raises sueh a commotion among the various&#xD;
garments, mentionable and unmentionable, suspended over-&#xD;
head, that it is some tinu~ before the astonished ~1r. Jimps is&#xD;
aware of the cause of this disturbance.&#xD;
But there she stands, - a little, shrinking, hollow-eyed&#xD;
girl, with a cheek almost as white as tho snow~matted in&#xD;
her abundant hair, and clinging to the folds of her miserable&#xD;
dress.&#xD;
"Well, what 's wanting, my girl 7" asked Mr. Jimps, a~&#xD;
the thin, wan face, scarcely higher than the level of the&#xD;
counter, was turned up to him, with a timid, appealing&#xD;
glance.&#xD;
"Please, sir," began a little, trembling, piping voice, "1&#xD;
have brought some shirts, and mother. ~wants to know j~i&#xD;
you will be kind enough to let. her have the money .~r&#xD;
them."&#xD;
Mr. Jimp~~k the package which the child drew from&#xD;
under her shawl, and deliberately counted the coarse gar-&#xD;
ments it contained, while the little one edged timidly towards&#xD;
the stove.&#xD;
"Three, four, five, six. Why, ohi1d,"      the gen-&#xD;
tleman, as he finished counting, "how is this? flere is~J~ut&#xD;
I&#xD;
half the lot we gave out to your mother.'~&#xD;
"Yes, sir~" returned the child, as she edged back to her first&#xD;
stand; "mother knew that ; but little Jenni~ has been so1.iok,&#xD;
sir, that we could not~get any more done; and and ~ ~t is&#xD;
so~ cold, and the coal is all gone. Mother hoped, swy~i~&#xD;

&#xD;
would be kind enough to pay her for these, and we will finish&#xD;
the others as soon as we can."&#xD;
"1 thought your mother understood our terms. I told her,&#xD;
when she took the work, that we made it a rule to pay only&#xD;
when the lot was done," returned Mr. Jimps. "There are&#xD;
plenty of people glad to work for us on these terms, and your&#xD;
mother cannot expect us to make an exception in her favor."&#xD;
"But, please, sir," plead the little one, "little Jennie is so&#xD;
sick, and " -&#xD;
But Mr. Jimps did not stay to hear her out; for, just&#xD;
at that moment, the outer door again opened, and a person&#xD;
entered, who slammed it to, right in the face of the storm,&#xD;
and began to stamp his boots and shake his garments in a&#xD;
way that gave strong proofs of their firm texture. As soon&#xD;
as Mr. Jimps caught sight of the high nose that peered like a&#xD;
projecting battlement over the folds of the red worsted com-&#xD;
forter which enveloped the lower portion of the new-coiner's&#xD;
face, he sprang round the counter, and, seizing his hand, shook&#xD;
it heartily, as he exclaimed,&#xD;
"Why, Uncle-John Markham! where did you come from?&#xD;
Did you snow down?"&#xD;
"No, Dimmie," returned the old man, taking off his low-&#xD;
crowned hat, and shaking a miniature snow-storm from its&#xD;
broad brim; "but I 'd like to been snowed ~r. Who 'd&#xD;
a thought it would have come by such handfuls ?s~j~ld another~&#xD;
when I started, I guessed there would' be more snow before I&#xD;
got back; but I did not think of its coming so like a judg-&#xD;
ment. I~lack Simon and I have had a time of it, I tell you,&#xD;
Dimmie. Whew! my fingers ache like the toothache!" he&#xD;
added, drawing off a thick pair of blue and white yarn mit-&#xD;
tens, and spreading his hard palms to the fire.&#xD;
"It is the worst storm we have had yet," returned Mr.&#xD;
Jumps, wincing sligl~tly at the appellation by which the old&#xD;
man addressedd him. In hi~ native village, he had always&#xD;
been known as" Diminie Jumps," it being a sort of abbrevia-&#xD;
&#xD;
tion of the classical cognomen, Demosthenes Ore~tes, bestowed&#xD;
upon him by his father, which he had ignored ever since his&#xD;
establishment in the city, signing his name D. Orestes Jimps,&#xD;
Esq. But he knew there was no use in arguing the case with&#xD;
Uncle John. lie would always remain Dimmie, with him;&#xD;
so he smoothed his brow, and said, heartily:&#xD;
"Come, Uncle John, take a seat and make yourself com-&#xD;
fortable, if you can, until some of the boys get back; then we&#xD;
will go up to the house. Julia will be delighted to see you.&#xD;
You will stay over to-morrow night with us, of~course. To-&#xD;
morrow night is Mr. E-'s donation party, ~nd you must&#xD;
certainly attend that. lie asks after you always, .when he&#xD;
calls." Then, chancing to let his eye fall on the, waiting child,&#xD;
whom he had quite forgotten, he said, with a gesture toward&#xD;
the door:&#xD;
"You had better run home, little girl. Your mother kno4s&#xD;
my terms, -'can't vary for any one. A man must have some&#xD;
rules, and stick by them, if he intends to do, anything," he&#xD;
added, turning to Uncle John.&#xD;
"Ay, sound doctrine that, Dimmie. But what is this?'&#xD;
Who could send a child out in such a storm?" said the old&#xD;
man, hastily rising, and stilding forward tq open the door, the&#xD;
knob of which the child was'vainly tryin turu. "There,&#xD;
run home little girl, if you diiii't intend to be buried," he&#xD;
cried; "your folks are crazy to send you out in su~&#xD;
weather."&#xD;
For a second, '~ere she crossed the threshold, ii~e little pal&amp;amp;&#xD;
face was turned up to his, as 'if to thank him, and he saw that&#xD;
it was wet 'with tears. ,&#xD;
"What, what!" he muttered; and was about, to follow&#xD;
her, when he was recalled by the'voice of Mr. Jimps:&#xD;
"Oom~ in,, uncle; you will catch your death standing in&#xD;

friends, if she has any, to send her out in such a storm?"&#xD;
asked the old man, as he again seated himself by the fire.&#xD;
"0, she don't mind it! She is. one of~the thousands you&#xD;
will find in the city; one scarcely knows who or what they&#xD;
are. Her mother came here for work; and, as she was rec-&#xD;
ommended by one of our h~nds, whom we could trust, we li~t&#xD;
her take some. I should think I had heard some one say that&#xD;
her husband was a dissipated sort of a fellow. The city is&#xD;
full of such people."&#xD;
"But wh&amp;amp;t sent her here to-day? Do you owe them any-&#xD;
thing, Dimmie?"&#xD;
"Owe them!" returned Mr. Jimps, laughing. "You n~ust&#xD;
think me hard run, not to be able to pay for half a dozen&#xD;
shirts. I always make it a rule to' pay for eath lot of work&#xD;
when it is brought in and answers inspection; and that is&#xD;
wI~t I call fair on all sides. it 'this woman wants me to&#xD;
do more; she has sent in half 'her lot, and wants me to pay&#xD;
her for these~before the rest are done."&#xD;
"And you did n't do iDimmie?" said the old man.&#xD;
"Not I. I should never get my work done at that rate.&#xD;
If she does not like the terms, she must look elsewhere for&#xD;
"I s'pose thei~&amp;amp;~re people who would have been foolish&#xD;
enough to have, done it, or, perhaps, given her a little some-&#xD;
tiling out of their own pockets," observed the old man, ,~atch-&#xD;
~ng the faee o~ Mr. Ji~nps with a very peotiliar expression.&#xD;
"Yes, and foolish enough they are, a~ you say. Now, I&#xD;
claixu to be as liberal rid benevolent as n~0sV men; but I act&#xD;
~ipon system in this a~ well as~ everything else. 'I pay my&#xD;

management. If these people really are worthy, a~nd need&#xD;
aid, let them apply to s~me of these, or to the city authority.&#xD;
Casu~d charity only encourages street-begging and idleness."&#xD;
- I s'pose there are some among them so&#xD;
&#xD;
I"&#xD;
&#xD;
proud that they Would rather starve than beg," returned the&#xD;
old man, with the same searching glance. "I dare say there&#xD;
are a good many, just in our neighborhood, at home, who&#xD;
would rub pretty close before they would do it."&#xD;
"No doubt of it. You would be surprised at the degree of&#xD;
pride manifested by the people who work for me, though many&#xD;
of them are poor as Job. These people are doubtless of the&#xD;
same stamp. Lewis," he added, addressing a young clerk,&#xD;
who entered, out of breath with facing the storm, "put down&#xD;
those half d6~en shirts to the credit of Mrs. Ives."&#xD;
"Miss Sarah Ives, George street?" queried the boy.&#xD;
"No; Mrs. Mary ]Ives, J3ingham Crossing, York road,"&#xD;
was the reply, as Mr. Jimps deliberately encased his dapper&#xD;
person in a wadded overcoat, and enveloped his throat in the&#xD;
voluminous folds of' a costly merino scarf.&#xD;
While he was drawing oa his overshoes, his guest took f~om&#xD;
his pocket a large pocketbook, and wrote a few words on a&#xD;
blank leaf.&#xD;
They were soon ploughing their way in the direction of Mr.&#xD;
Jixups' residence, Uncle John looking the storm sc~uare in the&#xD;
face, as if it were an old friend, and Mr. Jimps trying to give&#xD;
it the cut by turning sideways. It bore this a while; but, at&#xD;
last, as they turned a corner, it sprang out upon him,. and,&#xD;
flapping the long ends of his scarf in his face, suddenly lifted&#xD;
his shining beaver from his head, and lodged it in a snow..&#xD;
bank, which it ha~d been piling up right wider the windows of ~&#xD;
Governor B-.-..'s mansion, as if for the special ami3~enae~#t&#xD;
of a group of curly.~headed children and a lovely 'young lady,&#xD;
who were watching the process with delight.&#xD;
"0, if it had only happened anywhere else!" thought 1~z&#xD;
Jimps, as, with ono glance~ ~t the mischievous face ~ Miss&#xD;

suspicion that he rather enjoyed the disasters of Mr. Jimps.&#xD;
"I say, IDimmie," he remarked, seeing that gentleman&#xD;
pause and turn his hack to the storm to get breath, "that&#xD;
little girl must have a hard time of it getting home, won't&#xD;
she?"&#xD;
"Yes, her people were crazy to send her out at such a&#xD;
time. Ugh! the snow almost blinds one!"&#xD;
"Very likely,"' returned the old man, with a peculiar&#xD;
smile, replying to the first part of Mr. Jimps' rer~rk; "poor&#xD;
people are apt to do a great many strange things. But here&#xD;
we are at the door, and there is your wife at the window;"&#xD;
and, with a nod to the rather pretty-looking lady who looked&#xD;
down upon them, the old man followed his nephew into the&#xD;
house.&#xD;
Uncle JQhn Markham was warmly received by his nephew's&#xD;
wife. He was a bit of a humorist, "odd as Dick's hat-&#xD;
band," the people said in his vilh~ge (and, by the way, we&#xD;
should very much like to know in what the peculiarity of the&#xD;
said Richard's hat-band consisted). 'KEccentric," Mrs. Jimps&#xD;
whispered t6 her friends, as she introduced him; but then he&#xD;
was rich and childless, and rich folks can afford to be "odd."&#xD;
us visits were ever welcome among his nephews and nieces,&#xD;
not merely because of his wealth; for, though they were keen-&#xD;
sighted business people, and perhaps did not entirely put that&#xD;
out of the question, yet they had sense enough to love and&#xD;
respect the old man for his intrinsic goodness~&#xD;

"Simpson sent home the Btand today, dear," said Mrs.&#xD;
Jiwps, turning to her husband. "' It is a love of a thing.&#xD;

returned with a beautiful ixipier mache work-stand.&#xD;
"Why, it is a pretty thing enough," said the old man,&#xD;
looking at it with a good deal of interest, as his niece ex-&#xD;
plained the material and the process of manufacturing ' it;&#xD;
"that butterfly hovering over the rose, there, is as natural&#xD;
as life. But what 's it for, Julia? It is hardly strong&#xD;

"0, it will hold light things; and, then, it is such a beau~&#xD;
tiful ornament in a parlor!"                     -&#xD;
"And what might it have cost, niece?" he asked.&#xD;
"Only twenty dollars. Orestes, how I wish your vases&#xD;
had been sent home, so that Uncle John could have seen&#xD;
them, too. They are such beauties the real Bohemian&#xD;
glass, and no mistake."&#xD;
"And what do they cost?"&#xD;
"Twenty more," was the reply.&#xD;
"Well, Bimmie, you said you was liberal, to-day, and I&#xD;
do not dispute it; but it does seem to me, children, with my&#xD;
old-fashioned notions, that you might have laid out your&#xD;
money more wisely, considering your minister's wife and chil-&#xD;
dren. But you mean well, doubtless, and cannot fail to be&#xD;
benefited 'by it yourselves, whatever your friends iflay be;&#xD;
for no one ever opened their purse-strings out'ofldzi ~'&#xD;

"In that case, Uncle John, you will return a mu~1i bet~1~&#xD;

said Julia, ~hlushing and laughing. "We are getting up a&#xD;

before I can think of yours."&#xD;
"~Xonr society! Why, I did not know as you belonged to&#xD;
any one, uncle!"&#xD;
"You were mistaken, then," returned the old man, gravely.&#xD;
"For inanyjears I have been a member of' the oldest society&#xD;
in the world, - the same of which our Saviour was a distin-&#xD;
guished member while on earth, - the Society of Human&#xD;
Brotherhood, which has for its aim and object all the poor,&#xD;
oppressed, fallen and down-trodden beings upon God's earth.&#xD;
I must attend t~ this first, niece; and then I will see about&#xD;
yours.&#xD;
There was silence a few moments, before the old man, who&#xD;
had risen and walked to the window, added, gayly:&#xD;
"By the by, children, I guess I '11 just step round to the&#xD;
hotel, and take a look at 'Black Simon."'&#xD;
"Not to-night,. - you surely need not go out to-night,"&#xD;
cried Mr. and Mrs. Jimps in the same breath.&#xD;
"Why not? See, it has stopped snowing, and I am not&#xD;
quite so frail as Julia's stand there. Simon had a hard time&#xD;
of it getting here, and the hostler may neglect him, poor fel-&#xD;
low! You need not think I am lost if I am not back in an&#xD;

niay find so~rie old friends down there, and oii~t a while."&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
"Black Simon" was looked, after, and talked to for a few&#xD;
moments, much as if he had been a child; and then, instead&#xD;
of returning to the warm sItting-room of the hotel, or the&#xD;
elegant parlor of Mr. Jimps, the old man sturdily ploughed&#xD;
his way along the snowy streets, until he reached the suburbs&#xD;
of the city.&#xD;
Here he slackened his steps, and paused occasionally to&#xD;
decipher, by the dim light of the lamps, the numbers on some&#xD;

of the dilapidated buildings which lined the street. At last&#xD;
he approached one, from which issued. the sounds of' music&#xD;
and dancing, and knocked loudly at the door. It was opened&#xD;
by a rosy-checked Irish girl, in a gay ball costume and dirty&#xD;
white slippers.&#xD;
"Is there a family of the name of Ives living in this&#xD;
house?" asked the old man.&#xD;
"Yes there be - the poor craythers; but not in there,&#xD;
sir," was the reply, as she ~saw Mr. Markham about to lay&#xD;
hold of the latch of a door near by. "That is Teddy&#xD;
McGuire's room. The Ives' are above, sir. I will be after&#xD;
showing' ye the way, an' ye please."&#xD;
Uncle John followed the girl up the gloomy, dirty stairs,&#xD;
asking by the way (for the old man was a bit of a Yankee)&#xD;
what was the cause of the festivity below.&#xD;
"A wedding, sir. Mikey Flaherty is married to Tim&#xD;
:Doolan's Bridget, the night," returned the girl, with a.&#xD;
smile; adding, as she pointed to a door at the extreme end&#xD;
of the passage, "It 's there ye will find them ye seek."&#xD;
The old man turned to thank her, but she was already&#xD;
half way down stairs, stepping to the lively measure of an&#xD;
Irish jie'; so he walked on, and ~knocked gently at t1i~e door&#xD;
which the girl had pointed out. It was opened by the same&#xD;
pale-faced child whom he had seen in his nephew's s1~re.&#xD;
She looked up to him with a quick glance of recoguWi~xk,&#xD;
singledd with surprise, and then glancea toward he~mot~her,&#xD;
who sat leaning over a miserable bed, on which lay a little&#xD;
child, over whose face the ashen hue of death was already&#xD;
stealing. Seeing that her mother did not observe the stran-&#xD;
ger, she said:               =&#xD;
"It 's the gentleman who opened the door Lor me to-day,&#xD;
mother."&#xD;

tone, but deliberately shutting the door behind him. "tfear&#xD;

got home safe. My nephew, Mr. Jimps, did not quite&#xD;
understand the child, it seems; and J'have come to make it&#xD;
all straight." And he handed out a five-dollar bill as he&#xD;
spoke.&#xD;
The woman took the bill, looked at it a moment, and&#xD;
returned it with a heavy sigh.&#xD;
"I cannot change it, sir. I have not a cent of money in&#xD;
the world."&#xD;
"It 's all right, ma'am. I don't want any change - I&#xD;
mean Mr. Jimps don't; he is n't at all particular - that is&#xD;
I say keep it, ma'am; you need it all, and more too, in&#xD;
such weather as this."&#xD;
The woman looked at him with mingled wonder and sus~.&#xD;
picion. At length she said:&#xD;
"There is some mistake, sir. Mr. Jimps is a very partic-&#xD;
ular man, lie owes me but one dollar, and it may bring&#xD;
both of us into trouble if I keep the money."&#xD;
"Take it, IL say. Pounds! have not I a right to 'dQ as I&#xD;
please with my I mean, has n't Mr. Jimps a right to do&#xD;
what he pleases with his money? Take it, and make your-&#xD;
selves comfortable."&#xD;
The woman waited to be urged no more; she eagerly&#xD;
clutched the money, and burst into tears, as she cried:&#xD;
"The blessing of those ready to perish be upon you both,&#xD;
sir. I should not have sent out to-day; but we have neither&#xD;
food nor fuel, and little Jennie dying!"&#xD;
"Have you no one whom you can send out after food and&#xD;
fuel?" asked the old man, with a glance toward the further&#xD;
corner of the room, where, from beneath a pile of rags, came&#xD;
the heavy breathing of a man.&#xD;
"Yes," returned the woman, as with a troubled expression&#xD;
her eye followed his; "but William, poor fellow, is not well.&#xD;
He is worn out," she went on, with a sigh, "with care, and&#xD;

Ellen, sir, I will run down myself, and get what we want.&#xD;
It 's only two doors from here," she added, seeing the old&#xD;
man about to remonstrate.&#xD;
There was something in her manner that recalled to the&#xD;
old man Mr. Jimps' remark about her husband's intemperate&#xD;
habits. She fears to trust him with the money, and perhaps&#xD;
she is right, thought he, as he drew the scanty covering over&#xD;
the dying child, and began to look about for something to&#xD;
kindle a fire with, against the mother's return. -&#xD;
The little girl laid down the coarse shirt-skeve she was&#xD;
stitching, and came to his aid; but they could find nothing&#xD;
but a few bits* of paper.&#xD;
"That is Willie's kite, sir," whispered she, as the old man&#xD;
laid his hand on that article. "He brought it with him when&#xD;
we moved from the country; but I don't know as he will&#xD;
mind it much if we do take it, if he can only be warm."&#xD;
As she spoke, a curly head peered out from beneath the&#xD;
rags in the corner, and, presently, a little boy of five or six&#xD;
years old crept to her side.&#xD;
"Willie, don't wake father!" she whispered, hushing his&#xD;
exclamation of sQrprise at the eight of the stranger. '~ We aro&#xD;
going to have a fire, and something to eat, Willie," she added.&#xD;
"Mother has gone after the things. Mr. Jimps sent 1~lw&#xD;
money by this gentleman, and now it 's all right."&#xD;
The little boy's sleepy eyes flew wide open at the mention&#xD;
of food and fire, and he whispered, with a shy look at Uncle&#xD;
John:&#xD;
"But will ho take us away from this hateful place, sister,&#xD;
and give us dinners every day, just as we used to. have them&#xD;

red hands between his great palms. Ellen drew close to him,&#xD;
too, and he took her on the other knee, as he asked,&#xD;
"How long has the little one been sick, dear?"&#xD;
"Mother says she has never been well; but she ran about&#xD;
and played with Willie and me, until we came here. Ever&#xD;
since, she has been poorly, and we have had to hold her all&#xD;
the while. Sometimes she laughs when I show her my rose-&#xD;
bush, and puts up her hands to catch the leaves. . Biddy&#xD;
Flaherty gave it to me, sir; but, lately, she does not seem to&#xD;
notice anything, and mother thinks she will die."&#xD;
"And then she will go up to God;. away above the clouds,&#xD;
where the cold weather never comes," said little Willie, lift-&#xD;
ing his sober eyes to Mr. Markham's face. ." It 's a nice place&#xD;
up there, sir. Would n't you like to go too?"&#xD;
Before the old man could reply, the mother entered, fol-&#xD;
lowed by a man bearing food and coals.&#xD;
We do not know whose pleasure was the greatest, the&#xD;
hungry-eyed children's, as they ate their food by the glowing&#xD;
fire, or old John Markham's, as he sat by and looked o~1. We&#xD;
think the children's, however; for he could not but be sad-&#xD;
dened ~by the tale which he heard from the lips of the poor&#xD;
mother, as she hung over her child. It was the old story, which&#xD;
has blotted so many of the fair pages of the book of life.&#xD;
Poverty had followed sickness; thrown out of work, strang-&#xD;
ers in a strange place, disappointed and despairing, the hus~&#xD;
band and father had yielded to temptation, and tasted of the&#xD;
accursed cup, until he no longer cared for aught save the&#xD;
gratification of his brutal appetite. For some time past they&#xD;
had depended solely upon the earnings of the mother and&#xD;
little Ellen for support; and these had, of late, been much&#xD;
curtailed by the illness of little Jennie. "I could not let her&#xD;
~ lie and die before my eyes, even though we were all starved,"&#xD;
said the weeping mother.&#xD;

feelings of hope, and courage, and self.respect in the poor feb&#xD;
low's heart, to which he had long been a stranger.&#xD;

&#xD;
It was quite late when the old man reached his nephew's&#xD;
house that night, and Mr. Jimps and his wife were too sleepy&#xD;
to ask many questions; but next morning, at the breakfast..&#xD;
table, they were disposed. t&amp;amp; be quite curious on the subject&#xD;
of his late hours.&#xD;
"Fie, Uncle John," began Mrs. ~Timps, smiling, as she&#xD;
handed him his coWee; "this never will do. I shall have to&#xD;
write to Aunt Sarah about it."&#xD;
"I think I shall write t~ her myself; this morning" re-&#xD;
turned the old man, in the same light tone.&#xD;
"But, uncle, these must be very interesting people, these&#xD;
friends of yours, to keep you up so late," said Mr. limps.&#xD;
"They are; ~io much so, Dimmie, that I must introduce&#xD;
them to you. Will you call with me some time lii the'course&#xD;
of the day?"&#xD;
"With great pleasure, uncle."&#xD;
It being New-Year's day, however, Mr. Jimps, amid calls&#xD;
and business, quite forgot Uncle John's proposal - the more&#xD;
readily. as that old gent~lemau was absent most of the. 4ay on&#xD;
business of his own, and it was not until he was about' to&#xD;
dress for the donation party in the evening that the old. man&#xD;
saw fit to remind him of his engagement.&#xD;
"Why, it is too late, now, Uncle John. 'Julia has already&#xD;
commenced dressing for the party," said the little man.&#xD;
"Well, I can 't go to this party with you until I have&#xD;
called on these friends, that 's certain," said the old man.&#xD;
"If you are minded to go with me, I '11 have Black Simon&#xD;

and the sleigh at the door by the time you are dressed, and&#xD;
we can be there and back again by the time Julia gets rigged,&#xD;
if she is like most women-folks."&#xD;
Black Simon was at the door in time, and bore them with.&#xD;
flying steps along the crowded streets. On, on they went, past&#xD;
brilliantly lighted parlors, from whence came the sounds of&#xD;
music and laughter on, to where the streets began to nar-&#xD;
row, and the lights to dwindle, until, with a suddenness that&#xD;
almost took Mr. Jimps' breath from his body, the old man&#xD;
drew up before a rickety old building.&#xD;
"Uncle John, you must have mistaken the place! your&#xD;
friends surely cannot live here!" cried Mr. Jinips, from be-&#xD;
neath the many folds ,of his scarf&#xD;
"May be so we '11 see," was the reply, as the Qid man&#xD;
sprang out, and, taking a rope from the sleigh, fastened Black&#xD;
Simon securely to a post.&#xD;
It was too cold for Mr. Jimps to remonstrate; his teeth&#xD;
chattered and his scarf was almost frozen to his lips, even&#xD;
then; so, stepping carefully in his dainty, glistening boots,~he&#xD;
followed the old man through the gloomy hall and up the&#xD;
dirty stairs. Mr. Jimps was a somewhat fastidious person,&#xD;
and might, more than once, have taken exception to the&#xD;
various smells that, coming from the different rooms, seemed&#xD;
to congregate in that hall, had he not, fortunately, been too&#xD;
well wrapped up to be aware of them.&#xD;
Uncle John rapped ~softly at the lives' door, and, after&#xD;
waiting a few moments, as no one came, opi3necl it himself.&#xD;
One glance around the apartment taught him the 'cause of&#xD;
that silence. Near the stove, with his little boy in his arms,&#xD;
who was~ sobbing in that ~peculiar spasmodic manner that&#xD;
indicates the utter exhaustion of the physical frame, sat&#xD;
William lives, with, his eyes fixed upon the bed which had&#xD;
been arranged as decently as possible to receive the dead&#xD;
body of little Jennie. The mother had done all her scanty&#xD;
means allowed. She had parted the soft hair on the little&#xD;
&#xD;
brow, straightened the shrunken limbs,' and robed. them in a&#xD;
pretty white frock, the last relic of happier days. The dainty&#xD;
edgings with which it was trimmed were in strange contrast&#xD;
with the miserable bed-coverings edgings wrought by her&#xD;
busy fingers in those happy days when a mother's glad antici-&#xD;
pations first stirred her heart. Then she had flung herself on&#xD;
her knees by the side of the bed, and, with her face buried in&#xD;
the clothes, neither wept nor moved.&#xD;
The grave-eyed Ellen stooped over the bed, and was trying&#xD;
to place a poor, sickly-looking 'rose in the cold hands of the&#xD;
little one. Uncle John glanced at the hush she had showed&#xD;
him the night before, and he knew at once from whence it&#xD;
came. It was' her all, poor thing!&#xD;
She was the first to observe their entrance,' and soon bqth&#xD;
parents were mingling words of deep gratitude with' their'&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
"I shall never, never forget your kindness, sir, to 'the' day&#xD;
I die!" exclaimed the mother, turning to Mr. Jimps. "Much&#xD;
as we needed the money, starving as we were, we thought&#xD;
not less of your confidence in us than we did of that.' It&#xD;
was' so kind, so noble in you, to trust us! But you shall be&#xD;
repaid, sir; William and I are determined to do it, if we&#xD;
work our fingers to the bone! And this gentleman,. to cbme,&#xD;
as-he did, through the snow to aid us! 0, how can we ever&#xD;
be grateful enough?"&#xD;
My kindness - repay me ~-you here!" exclaimed the&#xD;
bewildered Mr. Jimps, turning to Uncle John, and rapidly&#xD;
unwinding the folds of his scarf, as if pressed for breath..&#xD;
"Yes, IDimmie, I was certain you did not quite understand&#xD;
the errand of' that little girl, yesterday, so I followed her&#xD;
home, and settled your bill mysdf. It was well I did, for the&#xD;
poor things needed it very~much."&#xD;

white-robed little figure on the bed, - "for ker, sir~ we had&#xD;

Mr. Jimps was neither an unjust nor hard-hearted man;&#xD;
he had sin~ply been guided by the current custom of the day;&#xD;
and, when he had subscribed his quota to any benevolent ob-&#xD;
ject, allowed, himself to consider his responsibility at an end.&#xD;
Now, a new light broke in upon him; he turned to his old&#xD;
relative, and said, earnestly&#xD;
"Thank you, thank you, Uncle John! you could not have&#xD;
done me a. kinder deed; or," he added, in a lower tone,&#xD;
"taught me a better lesson. It is one which I shall never&#xD;
fQrget."&#xD;
Ax~d, to do Mr. Jimps justice, he never did. lie told the&#xD;
story to Julia when they got home, and bravely took his share&#xD;
of the blame, while the tears gathered in her pretty eyes,&#xD;
and sb~e almost forgot her present and the donation party, in&#xD;

AN INCIDENT ON THE SEA-SHOI~E.&#xD;
Ernst ist ds.s Leben.&#xD;
*         ABOUT midway between Sachem's Head and Double Beach,&#xD;
those well-known watering places on the Connecticut shore, a1&#xD;
small cove or creek laps, like a silver tongue, up into the&#xD;
main land; and the waters, as if weary of the perpetual sLiMe&#xD;
an4 moaning seaward, cling close to the shore in little curve~&#xD;
and dents, and put out slender silver arms anig the course,&#xD;
green sedges of the marshes, as if. seeking f~r that inland&#xD;
quiet which it is their destiny never to attain.&#xD;
It is a quiet bit of water that small cove, set in a&#xD;
of White, wave-ribbed sand, backed by a circlet of house~s, ti&#xD;
green, rank marshes, and a low range of broken upland,&#xD;
scarcely worthy of the name of hills, but sufficient hut oft"~&#xD;

which indicates the outline of the Tetoket range ~f hills.&#xD;
But seaward roll ceaselessly the blue waves of the Sound,&#xD;
and, stretching along at the distance of from one half mile to&#xD;
some four or five miles from shore, are scattered a dozen or&#xD;
more islands.                                   -&#xD;

per, and their chief notion of liberty seems to be the right of&#xD;
"going to law."&#xD;
Some years ago it was my fortune to spend some weeks in&#xD;
this place. It was in the height of "the season," and the old&#xD;
farm-house of our landlord, Mr. 13-., was crowded with board-&#xD;
ers, who presented the usual variety of character. Among them&#xD;
were three who interested me exceedingly. Two of these were a&#xD;
mother and daughter quiet, reserved people, whose gar-&#xD;
nients of plain, deep mourning served to confirm the rumor&#xD;
that they were a minister's widow and child. The mother&#xD;
looked like one who bore the burden of some unspoken grief;&#xD;
and this was in part explained when one looked on the smalJ,&#xD;
delicate figure of her daughter,~ and noticed the deformitf&#xD;
of the spine between the shoulders, which no art of dress&#xD;
could wholly conceal. They never mingled with the boarders&#xD;
in the common room or on the lawn, but wandered, hand in&#xD;
hand, alone upon the beach, or sat by the open windows of&#xD;
their room, (which was divided from my own only by a thin&#xD;
pine partition), reading, sometimes the poets, Milto~i or&#xD;
Wordsworth, but oftener from the Bible, the sublime strains&#xD;
of David and. Isaiah, or the burning words of Paul. The&#xD;
landlord called the mother NLrs. Davenport, and the latter&#xD;
addressed the child as Bertha, and that was all I knew of&#xD;
them.&#xD;
The other person, whose presence was food for my busy&#xD;
mind, was Adrian Vannesse, a gentleman of some thirty-five&#xD;
years; at least, so I guessed, but he might have had a dozen&#xD;
years more or less, for his face and figure were cast in that&#xD;
grand, noble, almost severe mould, upon which time seems to&#xD;
leave~na i~ress.&#xD;
lie proved to be a former acquaintance and fellow-traveller&#xD;
* of my dear charge and young relative, Walter Aynton. They&#xD;
had met, a winter or two previous, in Cuba, and now renewed&#xD;
their acquaintance with pleasure. Indeed, Walter 'was de-&#xD;
lighted with this rencontre, and enthusiastic in his praises of&#xD;
&#xD;
K ~&#xD;
&#xD;
his friend, and not without reason; for Vannesse attached&#xD;
himself to our party, and I soon found that, to the accomplish-'&#xD;
ments and varied knowledge of the man of the world, he&#xD;
united rare scholarly attainments, habits of deep, ,original&#xD;
thought, an earnest love for the truth, and that rare and re-&#xD;
sistless individuality which wins and commands at the-same&#xD;
time. Tenderness equal to a woman's, too, I soon felt him to&#xD;
possess, when he took my young cousin under his charge, and&#xD;
made my office of nurse almost a sinecure. But with all&#xD;
these rare qualities, combined with wealth and that personal&#xD;
presence which is better than beauty, I felt that Adrian Van-&#xD;
nesse lacked something. I could not watch him and Wat~er&#xD;
long together, without feeling that the slender boy-student,&#xD;
with his pale cheek and sunken eye, passing so slowly, yet, as&#xD;
my heart told me, so surely away from earth, ~was far the&#xD;
richer and wiser of the two, for Adrian was an infidel.&#xD;
Something - I know not what - but something in his&#xD;
early experience had come to give strength and depth to those&#xD;
doubts that sooner or later beset such earnest, inqui6ng na-&#xD;
tures as his, and he had taken refuge in a refined species of&#xD;
materialism. This knowledge was an inference .drawn from a&#xD;
series of incidental remarks, rather than frOm any open state-&#xD;
inent of his own; for he was no vulgar asserted of his creed,&#xD;
no Jesuitical proselyter, bent upon bringing every one to his&#xD;
views.&#xD;
* To Walter Aynton, pain land illness had been the ar~gel&#xD;
with which he 'had wrestled, like Jacob of old, until he had&#xD;
obtained the blessing, the unspeakable blessing of perfect faith.&#xD;
and trust in God. Thus it was, in all our conver8atie~s oil&#xD;
life and life's ends, that all that seemed dark and intricate&#xD;
and contradictory, Walter trusted to God, certain that in the&#xD;
life beyond it would all be made cle~ir in the "brightness&#xD;
of the everlasting light." But Ii could read no corresponding&#xD;
faith in the dark eyes of Vannesse - no glow of~ hope lit up&#xD;
the calm, stern features of his grandly~chiselled face.&#xD;

AN il~OIX)ENT ON THE SEA"SXIORE.          18w).&#xD;
&#xD;
One glorious day, as we sat beneath the shade trees on fhe&#xD;
lawn, Adrian read, in soft, deep tones, that most musical, most&#xD;
melancholy, because most hopeless, of all Tennyson's poems,&#xD;
the "Lotus Eaters;" and as he closed he repeated, more to&#xD;
himself than us, and as if in answer to some query of his&#xD;
own mind:&#xD;
There is confusion worse than death;&#xD;
Trouble on trouble, pain, on pain,&#xD;
Long labor unto aged breath&#xD;
Sore task to hearts worn out with many wars,&#xD;
And eyes grown dim with gazing on the pilot stars ;"&#xD;
then ~added, slowly, "And this is the sum of life!"&#xD;
There was something so sad, so inexpressibly hopeless, in.&#xD;
his voice, that for a brief moment it did seem that this was&#xD;
indeed all; then~a bright glow lit up Walter's pale cheek, and&#xD;
he said:&#xD;
"Not so, dear Yannesse. Old Ulysses teaches a higher,&#xD;
better doctrine than that, heathen though he be!"&#xD;
And~ taking the book from Adrian's hand, he read the no-&#xD;
ble poem that bears the name of the sage of Ithaca - that&#xD;
poem so replete with kingly dignity, self-conscious power,&#xD;
melancholy fortitude, and manly self-reliance, softened and&#xD;
beautified by the memory of joys and trials long since "lived&#xD;
down," but which have made him&#xD;
"Strong to will,&#xD;
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield."&#xD;
Yannesse did not reply for some moments; and Walter,&#xD;
perchance mistaking the cause of his silence, said, reaching&#xD;
out a thin hand that was instantly folded in that of his friend:&#xD;
"Forgive me, Adrian. I have lived fewer, years than you,&#xD;
A.&#xD;
in number; but suffering, though bitter, is a rare teacher;&#xD;
and it seems to me uncommonly cowardly, so to speak, to&#xD;
doubt the existence or the goodness of God."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"I do not doubt the existence of a First Cause, Provi-&#xD;
dence, Creator, God - by whatever name you choose to&#xD;
designate it," began Yannesse, slowly. "He must be an idiot&#xD;
who does that. But what is this speck of a world to an infi-&#xD;
nite being such as we conceive him? What are we, that he&#xD;
should stoop to interfere with our affair~, or take note of our&#xD;
trivialities? Your old Syriac Job felt this keenly, when he&#xD;
exclaimed, 'What is man, that thou shouldst magnify him;&#xD;
that thou shouldst set thy heart upon him; that' thou shouldst&#xD;
visit him morning and evening, and try him every moment?'&#xD;
And as to his goodness and benevolence, look yonder,"- and,&#xD;
by a glance, he directed us to where the slight figure of Berm&#xD;
tha Davenport was slowly toiling up from the beach, -"there&#xD;
is an argument to the point. What has ~that young girl done,&#xD;
to be thus cursed from her birth? Endowed, if her face does&#xD;
not belie her, with all woman's restless yearning for compan-&#xD;
ionship, love, and yet shut off, by that organic curse, from&#xD;
all but woman's sorrows. Think you her unbia.~ed verdict&#xD;
would say much for his goodness?~~&#xD;
For a moment Walter's face was troubled; then, as he&#xD;
caught the love-lighted glance which the girl lifted toward&#xD;
the window where her mother sat, and saw the spiritual ex-&#xD;
pression of the small, sweet face, his own lighted up, and, ris-&#xD;
ing and laying his hand on Adrian's shoulder, he said, ear-&#xD;
nestly&#xD;
"Indeed, I do think so, my friend. Once, this same thing&#xD;
would have troubled me; but now I know, Adrian; for,&#xD;
'Knowledge by suffering entereth,&#xD;
And life is perfected by death.'"&#xD;
* Chance, as he would , call it, gave Adrian Yannesse an&#xD;
opportunity to ask these questions himself in the course ~f a&#xD;
few days, as the incident I am about to relate will show.&#xD;

passed over them.&#xD;
There was no comfort anywhere; towards night the air,&#xD;
instead of growing cooler, seemed to be stiller, sultrier, more&#xD;
stifling, if possible, than before, and, leaving Walter on a~&#xD;
sofa, Adrian 'Vannesse and I walked down to the beach. We&#xD;
did not gain' much, for the sand scorched our' eyes and our feet;&#xD;
besides, it was "dead low water," and the great bare, muddy&#xD;
flats lay reeking and steaming in the sun, in all their unsight-&#xD;
liness; for, whatever may be true of the great ocean, I am&#xD;
certain that everything cast into the sea near shore does not&#xD;
"Suffer a sea-change&#xD;
Into something rich and strange.&#xD;
However, ~we walked on, until we left the hamlet behind&#xD;
us, and reached a dilapidated fish-house, which served to&#xD;
shelter the man who acted as Charon in all our sailing and&#xD;
fishing expeditions. Once or twice I had penetrated into the&#xD;
hidden mysteries of the place, for the. sake of seeing the&#xD;
man's bed-ridden mother - a great, gaunt skeleton of a&#xD;
woman, half palsied, who sat up in her bunk, sick or well, and&#xD;
netted seine.&#xD;
The man himself wa~ a specimen, both in a physical and&#xD;
psychological view, not&#xD;
"Lean and lank and brown,&#xD;
As is the ribbed sea sand,"&#xD;
like the ancient xn~riner, but sturdy,, and, as Vulcan himself,&#xD;
with a complexion like the red earth of which he was formed;&#xD;
neither had he the long "white beard and glittering eye,~~&#xD;
which wrought such a spell upon the luckless wedding-guest,&#xD;
but a beard short, and stiff, and grizzled, like a mildewed&#xD;

K&#xD;

stubble-field, and a light gray eye, overhung by massy, shaggy&#xD;
eyebrows. But, like to old Chaucer's "~hipman,"&#xD;
('Of a nice conscience, no great care he kept;~~&#xD;
nor of his temper either, judging from the many stories we&#xD;
heard of his fierce, ungovernable rage; bursts ~f passion, that&#xD;
proved him more fit for the mad-house than elsewhere; yet&#xD;
his neighbors had not failed to take advantage of this infirm-&#xD;
ity, and had involved him in lawsuit after lawsuit, and given&#xD;
him one month's residence in the county jail after another,&#xD;
until he had been reduced from the ownership and mastership&#xD;
of ~ pretty schooner, to one or two pet sail-boats, and had&#xD;
exchanged a comfortable home for this miserable shelter, in&#xD;
which, with his old mother and his only remaining child, a&#xD;
bright-eyed boy of ten, he contrived to weather out summer&#xD;
and winter.&#xD;
One redeeming trait' of manhood he had kept through all&#xD;
he' was always true to his word, and on all our expeditions&#xD;
he was punctual to a minute. For the rest, to quote again&#xD;
from Chaucer:&#xD;
"In his own craft to reckon well the tides,&#xD;
The sea~s deep currents *~nd the shoals besides,&#xD;
The sun's height, and the moon's, and pilotage,&#xD;
There was none such from Hull unto Carthage."&#xD;
Now he sat on a decayed piece of timber without the hut,&#xD;
with his tarpaulin jammed down upon his head, and his, red&#xD;
flannel shirt-sleeves rolled up above his elbows, splicing a&#xD;
parted rope. Adrian exchanged a word or two with him&#xD;
about their plans for the next morning, and 'we passed on to&#xD;
where the lee of a rocky point promised some hope of ~h~lter&#xD;
from the sun. Here we sat, and pertinaciously ~iil1ed up&#xD;
visions of icebergs and Polar seas, of wintry shipwrecks and&#xD;
frozen mariners, not forgetting&#xD;

But it was in vain; we could not even raise an imaginary&#xD;
breeze. The pale, coppery sky seemed to shut down closer&#xD;
and closer over us, and we could only sit and laugh at our&#xD;
own folly. At length there came one or two slight puffs of&#xD;
air from the westward, and Adrian, who was well versed in the&#xD;
signs of the weather, suggested that we should go home before&#xD;
the storm overtook us.&#xD;
I laughed at the idea of a storm; but, helping me up the&#xD;
rocks which had sheltered us on the west, he pointed to where,&#xD;
all along the western sky, from the horizon towards the ze-&#xD;
nith, stretched fine lines of pale yellow light, saying:&#xD;
"Look; there is the proof of my words; and, see," he con-&#xD;
tinued, climbing to the highest point, which gave us an out-&#xD;
look beyond the range of hill8 to the north and west, " there it&#xD;
comes, in good earnest."&#xD;
And all along the west stretched a cloud, black as night,&#xD;
save where its beautifully-curved edge was bordered with a&#xD;
strip of clear silvery hue.&#xD;
"We shall hardly have time to reach home," observed&#xD;
Adrian, as he watched its rapid strides up the western sky.&#xD;
Still we lingered, in awe and admiration, until, lighting up&#xD;
its edge for a few moments with a richer splendor, the sun, dis-&#xD;
appeared beneath it, and its black shadow fell on land and&#xD;
sea. Then came the muttered thunder, followed by the crink-&#xD;
ling lightning. There. was a pause, while the light streak&#xD;
near the horizon, rapidly widened, and the ocean moaned and&#xD;
rocked in long, undulating swells; and then came a roar as&#xD;
of many waters - a rush as of the wings of mighty winds -&#xD;
and the storm was upon us; not of mere rain-drops, but a&#xD;
thick, blinding, bewildering spray. and mist, driven before the&#xD;
fiercest of winds.&#xD;
&#xD;
Adrian Vannesse drew his strong arm about me, and started&#xD;
for the fisherman's hut, the only accessible shelter; but ~he&#xD;
proceeded only a few paces, before he stopped short, exclaim-&#xD;
ing, in a tone of horror:&#xD;
"Good God! what madness!"&#xD;
And, following the direction of his glance, I saw, throttgh&#xD;
the thick mist and spray, for one moment, the white sail of &amp;amp;&#xD;
boat, a few rods distant from the ii~ocky point we had just&#xD;
left - for one moment; then came aloud, shrill, fearful cry of&#xD;
agony and deathly fear, swelling above the storm; and The&#xD;
boat, and he who uttered it, went down beneath the leaping&#xD;
waves.&#xD;
"Make for the hut!" shouted Adrian Vannesse.&#xD;
And the next moment I was alone, and he, followed by&#xD;
another wild, bareheaded figure, that came rushing along the&#xD;
beach, had dashed into the surf.&#xD;
I did not heed the storm, scarcely moved or breathed, until&#xD;
Vannesse emerged from the water, followed by our old boat-&#xD;
man, bearing in his arms a human body; then liled to the&#xD;
hut, and reached it in time to see them enter, and lay down&#xD;
upon the floor the body of the boatman's only son. The man&#xD;
looked at no one, heeded no one, nor even replied to his old&#xD;
mother's scream of terror; but, lifting the lad~s head to his&#xD;
knee, wrung the water from the tangled, sun-burned locks,&#xD;
and chafed the cold, wet hands.&#xD;
"ibId your tongue, mother!" he cried, at last. "There 's&#xD;
life in the lad yet! Get up, you old fool, and gi'e me the&#xD;
blanket, can't ye?"&#xD;
"0! Dave,~Dave, man! the lad never '11 breathe again&#xD;
he 's clean gone!" screamed the old woman; but he cut her&#xD;
short with a volley of curses, and, with a sudden jerk, drew'&#xD;
the ragged coverlet from beneath her old bones, and wrapped&#xD;
it round the child.&#xD;

but in vain. At length, pointing to a dark bruise on hi~&#xD;
temple, he said:&#xD;
"' My poor friend, this is useless. Your boy will never&#xD;
speak or move again. He is dead!"&#xD;
"Not speak again ! - not move, - my Billy, - the hand-&#xD;
iest, smartest lad on the whole cove, - dead!" said the man,&#xD;
dreamingly. "You lie! "he shouted, turning suddenly upon&#xD;
Yannesse; "he never minded a ducking, - he a'n't dead!"&#xD;
and he again set to chafing the stiffened limbs.&#xD;
Adrian did not reply otherwise than by placing the miser-&#xD;
able father's hand over the pulseless heart. The man drew&#xD;
back with a start and a shudder that ran through his giant&#xD;
frame; then, sinking down on the floor, he sat gazing into the&#xD;
child's pale, open face with a look of vacant, dumb misery.&#xD;
"Dead! dead! He 'II never hail the skiff again, -never.&#xD;
0, my boy! my boy!" and the groans of the strong man in&#xD;
his agony were mingled with the raging of the storm.&#xD;
Suddenly the old woman raised herself up, and said, in a&#xD;
tone that was a strange blending of childishness and authority,&#xD;
"It 's the hand o' God, Davy the hand o' G~od! "~&#xD;
"Then why didn't he take you, you old worthless hulk, or&#xD;
me, who am good for nothing but to die; and not the laughing ,&#xD;
happy boy?" said the miserable man, angrily. "Ah, Billy,&#xD;
lad, - the last o' ten, all gone! all gone ! -gone where?"&#xD;
he muttered, as if a new thought were struggling in upon his&#xD;
gri~f. Then turning to Adrian Vannesse, he seized his arm,&#xD;
~i~nd said, eagerly:&#xD;
"Ye are a lamed man, sir, an' I believe a good un! I've&#xD;
heard ye and other un reading' an' talking' in outla~idis1i tongues,&#xD;
soch as the likes o' me don't understand, an' ye know a great&#xD;
many things, - say, where is my boy gone? Shall I ever see&#xD;
him agin?"&#xD;
And he, - the all-accomplished man of the world, the rare&#xD;
scholar, the deep thinker, who prided himself on the strength&#xD;
of his reason, and boasted that man's intellect was sufficient&#xD;
&#xD;
AN INOIDEi~T ON THE SA-SHOIW.&#xD;
&#xD;
for his wants, - stood dumb before the mighty mystery of&#xD;
Death! Among all his fine-wrought arguments and subtleties&#xD;
of the intellect, there was not one which could give comfort to&#xD;
that wretched, questioning father, or lift his bruised spirit&#xD;
above the lifeless lump of clay at his feet!&#xD;
"It 's a' in the Bible, wan," muttered the old crone.&#xD;
"Surely, Dave, I gin ye good schoolin' in the days long&#xD;
, ,,&#xD;

"Ay, and bad enough sin', mother!" murmured th*e man;&#xD;
"so it is e'en as broad as 't is long;" and again he bent his&#xD;
deep, earnest gaze upon Vannesse. But, before his lips could&#xD;
utter again the startling, "Where is he gone?" a slight figure,&#xD;
with dripping black garments clinging to her delicate limbs,&#xD;
and long, golden curls streaming over her shoulders, c~me&#xD;
softly from a remote corner of the room, and, laying her small&#xD;
white hand on the arm of the giant boatman, said, earnestly,&#xD;
in low, silvery tones, that seemed somehow to carry with them&#xD;
conviction:&#xD;
"ile has gone to God, sir; - that," pointing to the life-&#xD;
less body, "is only the form, the shell, in which your little&#xD;
boy lived while here. Now, he has gone home to our&#xD;
Father in heaven, where there is neither sin, nor sorrow,&#xD;
nor pain.~~&#xD;
The bereaved father looked straight into the clear, angel&#xD;
face of the young girl, full a moment, before he replied:&#xD;
"If he is our Father, Miss, and good as you say, why did&#xD;
he let him die? I would n't 'a let hint"&#xD;
"That you may be the more willing to follow him, perhaps,"&#xD;
said the girl. "Tell me," she went on; "you have lived a&#xD;
long time; has life been so very pleasant?- would you. bring&#xD;
him back to live just the life you have lived?"&#xD;
The man turned his thoughtful glance from her face to that&#xD;
of the dead, a moment, before he replied.&#xD;

shall I ever see him agin, Miss? Is it true, what them par-&#xD;
sons say?" he added, anxiously.&#xD;
"Yes, you shall see him, if you obey God, for you 'shall&#xD;
go to him, but he shall return no more to you,' ~' waa the quiet&#xD;
answer; and then, in that low, sweet tone, she went on to&#xD;
speak of God - not as the Unknown, the Infinite, over whose&#xD;
essence and attributes philosophers lose themselves in a waste&#xD;
of words, but as the all-wise, all-good Father - and of the*&#xD;
Son, who "carrieth the lambs in his bosom," to whom even&#xD;
the most poor and ignorant may come, and find pardon and&#xD;
Adrian Vannesse never forgot that lesson. With Bertha&#xD;
Davenport leaning on his other arm, we walked home after&#xD;
the tempest had spent its fury, and learned how she, too, had&#xD;
been caught in the storm, and forced to seek shelter in the&#xD;
fisherman's hut; but he said little or nothing until we reached&#xD;
the porch of our temporary home~. Then, taking her hand, and&#xD;
baring his head, as if in reverence, he said:&#xD;
"Pardon me, Miss Davenport, and do me the justice to&#xD;
believe that I ask from no idle motive. But this religious&#xD;
faith of yours, tell me, has it brought you rest? Is it suffi-&#xD;
cient for all times and seasons?"&#xD;
The sweet, child-like face was raised to his ,a moment, ii~&#xD;
surprise; then, pointing to where the black clouds rolled in&#xD;
jagged masses over the western sky, she said:&#xD;
"There come days and hours, in all lives, - certainly in&#xD;
mine, - when clouds and thick darkness are about us, like&#xD;
those yonder; but I know that behind them shines the sure&#xD;
sun of God's love; and I have peace, deep and abiding&#xD;
peace."&#xD;
And, surely, no one who looked upon that serene, thought-&#xD;
ful face, could doubt it.&#xD;
Adrian Vannesse, like many another thoughtful soul,&#xD;
after suffering grievous temptations, is now a preacher of&#xD;
&#xD;
God's truth; and when doubt or discouragement beset him,&#xD;
as they sometimes will, he has only to look down into the&#xD;
clear eyes of her whom he once thought born only ~s the&#xD;
heritor of woman's sorrows, to read there a never-failing&#xD;
evangel of faith and hope, as he whispers the sweet, fond&#xD;
words, "My wife."&#xD;

DEATH J3Y THE WAY-SIDE.&#xD;
A ~XETCH.&#xD;
"Never before had the forests of America witnessed such a sight!&#xD;
Never again was there such a pilgrimage from the sea-side 'to the&#xD;
delightful banks of the Connecticut ! "' - BANCROFT.&#xD;
SUCH is the language of the eloquent historian, with refer-&#xD;
ence to the journey of that band of pilgrims, who, in the&#xD;
pleasant spring-time of 1630, turned their backs upon such&#xD;
vestiges of comfort and civilization as tl~ie infant settlements&#xD;
of Massachusetts Bay afforded, and, headed by~-thek-heloved-----&#xD;
pastor, the Rev. Thomas Hooker, made their way through&#xD;
perils innumerable, across swamps and streams, over rough&#xD;
and rocky highlands, 'and through tangled woods and deep&#xD;
green valleys; with no guide but a compass, and no shelter&#xD;
but the heavens, until, like the Israelites of old, they crossed&#xD;
the goodiee river," and upon its western bank raised their&#xD;
altars, and laid the foundation of the pleasant city of Hart-&#xD;
ford.&#xD;
And he is right. More than two hundred years have&#xD;
elapsed, and "companies by fifties and by. Jutndreds" of  ~e~&#xD;
England's sons, with A~heir wives o~id ~their little ones, have&#xD;
gone forth from her rigged hula Mid shelteredd valleys, to seek&#xD;
a~4cher reward for their labor amid the fertile prairies of the-&#xD;

and the right, and. which inspires the heart of the feeblest&#xD;
woman, as well as the strongest man, - in all that goes to&#xD;
make up true moral grandeur, none can compare with this.&#xD;
It is not without significance that the old writers speak of&#xD;
this company, as consisting"of; " about one hundred souls."&#xD;
They were not mere bodies, seeking a new field for The grat~&#xD;
fication of animal appetites and pleasures, but souls, with ends&#xD;
and aims that took hold on eternity, and who faced famine and&#xD;
death, not for wofidly gain, but that they might obtain liberty~&#xD;
to give an external development to those truths which had.&#xD;
already made them free in spirit. In proof of this, we need&#xD;
only adduce the fact, that, in all succeeding emigration of&#xD;
their descendants, the seeds of whatever they have carried&#xD;
with them that is truest, best, most ennobling, - that which&#xD;
gives vitality to their institutions, - may be traced 'back to&#xD;
our early' fathers; and even now they move us with a sway&#xD;
mightier than any living influence.&#xD;
No. The world, even, counts few pilgrimages like that!&#xD;
That there will yet arise prophets and disciples dowered ~itk&#xD;
a fuller and clearer knowledge of the truth, we earnestly trust&#xD;
and believe; yet these men shall not die; or, rather, like Abel,&#xD;
being dead, they shall yet speak, and their voices vibrate along&#xD;
the chain of existence until time is no more.&#xD;
It was toward the close of a rare day in June, that the&#xD;
pilgrims from a ridge of wooded highlands caught their first,&#xD;
faint glimpse of the beautiful river. Many a hill and valley&#xD;
swamp and morass, lay between; but then it wa~ like a nar-&#xD;

almost breathless silen~c~, there arose an irrepressible sho~it~~-&#xD;
a clear old English shout ~ that woke the sleeping e~4~1~r&#xD;

coming had aroused from their lairs, mingled with the un-&#xD;

her an object of peculiar interest to every beart.&#xD;
"She had scarcely recovered from the effects of her sea-&#xD;

satisfied, now pulling back the rich waves of. hair that fell,&#xD;
too heavily over her cheek,- and thought of the dread trial.&#xD;
that awaited him, all the human stirred within him, and&#xD;
he, too, murmured, "Poor Geoffrey!"&#xD;
There had been a time when he and many others had&#xD;
heard, with surprise and regret, that Geoffrey Winstanley,&#xD;
with his strong will, clear intellect, and sincerely religious&#xD;
heart, had become the thrall of a young beauty of sixteer4&#xD;
the favorite niece of the haughty rector of $windon, and&#xD;
that he lingered in England in the hope of making her his&#xD;
wife. They felt ready to say to him, in the words of Ma-&#xD;
noah to Samson, "Is there no woman among the daughters&#xD;
of thy brethren, nor among all thy people, that thou goest to&#xD;
take a wife of the unci~,cumcised Philistines?"&#xD;
But when she stood among them as hi~ wife, and they&#xD;
heard how, for the sake of the proscribed Puritan, she had&#xD;
braved the anger and persecution of her relativeS, -~ hen they&#xD;
saw the tenderness~ meekness, and reverence, with ~w~hich she&#xD;
looked up to all her husband's friends, - the heart of the mbst&#xD;
rigid warmed towards her; and with Mr. Hooker's family&#xD;
she soon became "our gentle Maude.". As the good man&#xD;
thought of all this, and of her gentle yet earnest ~l4th, and&#xD;
the many times within the past few weeks when he had vis-&#xD;
ited her in his capacity of teacher, and came away a learner,&#xD;
his heart smote him for his injustice.&#xD;
He was, indeed% right.. Under the combined teaching of&#xD;
tove and Death, Maude Winstanley was ripening, for eter-&#xD;
nity. Once she bad resolutely shut her heart against even&#xD;
the thought of the latter, it seemed so impossible that dt~ath&#xD;
could reach her,, shielded by Geoffrey's love and sheltered in&#xD;
his arms. But as the weeks went on, deepening the sym~.&#xD;
toms of that: fatal disease that steals upon its victims silently&#xD;
as. autumn steals~upon the hills, and robes them with a beai~ty&#xD;
which is not of this world, hei~ heart awoke to a deeper in-&#xD;
sight of spiritual truth; the high doctrines ~so often discussed&#xD;

4~etween her husband and her pastor grew clearer to her&#xD;
understanding, and bore fruit for eternity.&#xD;
Still, the human was strong within her; and there came&#xD;
moments especially when she felt the deep eyes of her hus-&#xD;
band k~oking down upon her with such an expression of unut-&#xD;
terable love and sorrow, and his strong frame shake with&#xD;
agony if she did but breathe of what awaited them when&#xD;
h~r lips trembled and her heart shrunk shudderingly from the&#xD;
thought of the grave and the winding..sheet - when earth&#xD;
with him seemed better than heaven without him.&#xD;
Do not blame her too severely, thou of stronger faith, but&#xD;
remember; she was but a gentle, loving girl, and wisdom and&#xD;
faith grow but~ slowly in this sphere of ours. If you have&#xD;
met a trial like this with more unwavering faith, thank God&#xD;
for it; or, if as yet the bitter cup has not been presented to&#xD;
your lips, still thank God, - for it is of his mercy alone, -&#xD;
but blame her not.&#xD;
God did not, but gave to her heart that assurance, without&#xD;
which immortality itself would be but a cheat the blessed&#xD;
assurance that affection dies not with the breath; that in a&#xD;
little while, a few brief days at most, that love, freed from&#xD;
the stain~ and impurities of earth, should~ again beam on her&#xD;
from those beloved eyes, and those arms once more fold her&#xD;
in their pure, holy embrace.&#xD;
And Geoffrey Winstanley, while he gazed intQ her spir-&#xD;
itual eyes, and listened to her lows earnest tones, as she'&#xD;
poured forth for his comfort those blessed intuitions, felt the&#xD;
gnawing pain at his heart grow still, but only to return with&#xD;
tenf~Ad power when they ceased, and he found himself aiozie~&#xD;
That was n~ boyish fancy that had led him to linger be-&#xD;
i~i~d his friends in England, and miet their looks of grave&#xD;
reproof, fq~ the sake of Maude Edgerton. lie had left the&#xD;
first flush of youth some years behind, when she stole in&#xD;
upon the unsunned ride of his heart, and gave to life a new,&#xD;

He had been an orphan from childhood, and the influences&#xD;
under which he had grown to manhood had not failed, while&#xD;
they strengthened and developed to the utmost his mental&#xD;
and moral energies~ to deepen the natural reserve of his char-&#xD;
acter, until even those who knew him best had little concep-&#xD;
tion of' the earnest enthusiasm, the boundless capacity for&#xD;
affection, that lay concealed beneath his calm, grave, almost&#xD;
stern, exterior. Earnest, truthful, noble, and sincerely reli-&#xD;
gious, he yet lacked that feminine influence so necessary to&#xD;
man's highest development: to temper~ justice with mercy,&#xD;
energy with softness, inflexibility with grace, and render his&#xD;
whole character symmetrical and in harmony with the Divine&#xD;
Ideal.&#xD;
This had been Maude's mission; and could he part with&#xD;
her now, when life first seemed blossoming to completeness&#xD;
when each hour brought some new, delicious joy, of which&#xD;
his solitary youth had been defrauded? Could he lay that&#xD;
head down in the grave, whose every golden tress was dearer&#xD;
to him than life, and, looking calmly up, say, "Thy will be&#xD;
done?"&#xD;
Not without a struggle, the bitterness, of which fc~ even&#xD;
dreamed, for his was not a nature that manifestedits emo-&#xD;

fretfulness of the minister's youngest child, he replied, "It&#xD;

The sight of the beautiful river, which had spread such&#xD;
joy through the band, had not failed to stir the 4eep enthu-&#xD;
siasm of Geoffrey Winstanley's nature; and, as that. clear&#xD;
June day deepened into twilight, he sat by the hide of Naude&#xD;
in that sylvan tent, and spoke, with the heart of a poet and&#xD;
the eye of a prophet, of their future home, and the mighty&#xD;
destiny that should yet wait on their humble effo~ts.&#xD;
Maude listened long and in silence; then, summoning all&#xD;
her God-given strength, she spoke to hini of the home that&#xD;
awaited her, tiot with him, on the banks of the beautiful Con-&#xD;
necticut, but by that river of life whose stream makes glad&#xD;
the city of God.&#xD;
She did not need to look up in his face; for the trembling&#xD;
of the arm that encircled her, and the large, burning tear-&#xD;
drop that fell on her forehead, spoke plainly of the agony&#xD;
her words had awoke within him. They seemed to have&#xD;
changed natures - that high-hearted, calm, grave man, and1&#xD;
the yielding, fragile maiden,; but, as she kept on, there was&#xD;
something so serene in her faith, so holy in the calm resigna~.&#xD;
tion with which she spoke of death, so exalting ira her ~dews&#xD;
of the life beyond, that he was lifted above himself; and,&#xD;
leaning his head on those golden locks, he poured out all his&#xD;
selfish struggles, and told how for weeks past he had been&#xD;
ready to struggle with God to retain her still on earth.&#xD;
"Earth! what is earth, my husband?" she replied; "but&#xD;
a few short years of troubled joy at best; and what is this,&#xD;
compared with that rest which remaincthfbr the children of&#xD;
God? That rest will soon be mine; and there I shall await&#xD;
you. You will not fail to meet me there, beloved."&#xD;
"God aiding me, I will not. In this hope, and with this&#xD;
aim, I shall live and die," he replied, fervently.&#xD;
&#xD;
For a few moments there was silence between them, while&#xD;
the grateful evening breeze stirred the leafy covering of their&#xD;
hut, and let in the soft June moonlight, that fell like a halo&#xD;
of glory over the golden locks of the invalid. A smile flut-&#xD;
tered round her mouth; then a strange tremor for a brief&#xD;
second shook her whole frame, and struck an icy chill to the&#xD;
husband's heart; for, with that passing 'moonbeam, the spirit&#xD;
of Maude Winstanley swept upward from the earth.&#xD;
0, death! death ~ death! thou masked angel, whom our&#xD;
tear-dimmed eyes cannot unveil; thou fearful void, which&#xD;
reason cannot fathom; thou icy silence, which love cannot&#xD;
break; thou dread pause, which no earthly power can 1111 -&#xD;

"Lo! it is I-be not afraid!"&#xD;
Not there 0, not there, with that beloved form stiffen-&#xD;
ing in his arms, and that heavy, benumbing sense of ~or-&#xD;
row weighing down upon his heart not when, with kiss&#xD;
after kiss upon that cold brow, he resigned her to the care&#xD;
of the weeping women who had gathered round, and rushed&#xD;
out into the night - not when the hand of Mr. Hooker&#xD;
grasped his in true and silent sympathy, could Geoffrey Win.~&#xD;

LITTLE BESSIE.&#xD;
PART I.&#xD;
IT was the last morning of the old year. The cold was in-&#xD;
tense; the dense leaden-hued clouds that covered the heavens&#xD;
were burdened with snow, and the earth beneath was frozen&#xD;
almog~ as hard as a miser's heart. The dulling north-east&#xD;
wind, as it whistled through old passages and round sharp&#xD;
corners, seemed laden with the last breath of frozen mariners,&#xD;
who sit death-bound and ice-bound on board their motionless&#xD;
ships in the 'far northern seas, waiting the coming of our&#xD;
Lord.&#xD;
'Ugh! it was freezing cold, and old Mrs. Lyman's hands&#xD;
~shook like brown withered leaves in autumn, as she tied the&#xD;
hood and folded the blanket around the shoulders of her&#xD;
grand-daughter, Bessie, preparatory to 'sending her forth to&#xD;
gather material to replenish their wasting fire. But little&#xD;
Bessie's blood was warm and quick; besides, her thoughts&#xD;
were so divided between 'the; new mittens (not knit of nice r~d&#xD;
yarn, reader~ like the pair you remember, but made out of&#xD;
bits of red flannel), which grandmother had finished for her&#xD;
the night before, and the nice, white chips that Esquire&#xD;
Brown's men had left in the hill-side woods, and given her&#xD;
permission to gatb~er, that she did not mind the cold nor notie~&#xD;
the unusual tremor in her grandmother's hands.&#xD;
But when the old lady placed a slice of bread in her basket,.&#xD;
saying she would i~e~d it to keep out tl~e gold, something in&#xD;
her voice attracted the child's attention. ~l~e gazed anxiously&#xD;

&#xD;
in the pale', sorrowful face that bent over her, then taking the&#xD;
bread from the basket, eyed it closely.&#xD;
"Grandmother," she said, "this is the slice I brought out&#xD;
for your breakfast. You have eaten nothing to.day. Are&#xD;
you ill, grandmother?"&#xD;
"No, my child."&#xD;
"Then, why did you not eat it? Surely," she continued, as&#xD;
if struck by some sudden thought, "we have food enough to&#xD;
last until to-morrow, when I shall carry in the work to Mr.&#xD;
G-.--, and get the pay. There is the piece of bread and the&#xD;
bit of fish - and "-&#xD;
"Ay, little Bessie, you are no fairy, to turn stones into&#xD;
bread," said the old lady, with a faint smile. "Your list i~&#xD;
soon told. Besides, you 'forget that there is a storm coming&#xD;
up, and you may not be able t~ go to town for some days. Th'&#xD;
that case, we must make what we have last as well as we&#xD;
can.        -&#xD;
The little girl stood for a moment gazing vacantly out the&#xD;
window, while her great blue eyes filled with tears. Suddenly&#xD;
her whole face lighted up; she dashed away the tears, and,&#xD;
pointing to a pair of little brown snow-birds hopping about on&#xD;
the withered branches of catnip that grew beneath the window,&#xD;
in search of seeds, said:&#xD;
"See, grandmother, God feeds them! He will not let us&#xD;
starve."&#xD;
"Right, child. May He forgive my want of faith," replied&#xD;
the grandmother, fervently. "Now go, IBessie, and I will&#xD;
meet you at the foot of the hill, and help you home with your&#xD;
basket."&#xD;
Grandmother Lyman and little Bessie had not always been&#xD;
so poof; but, as the old lady expressed it, things had 'be&amp;amp;n&#xD;
going wrong with. them ever since poor John, Bessie's father,&#xD;
was crushed by the falling of a portion of the buib~pg on&#xD;
which he was at 'work. After son~e months of suffering, God&#xD;
took him home; and it was not long before hi~ heart-broken&#xD;

yoaing wife followed him, leaving little on :earth, save the&#xD;
orphan Bessie. True, Mrs. Lyman had another son, many&#xD;
years older than Bessie's father, who had left her, while yet a&#xD;
boy, to gratify~ his passion for the sea. Though she had not&#xD;
heard from him for many years,. she was 'not certain of his&#xD;
death; therefore, whenever the great storms arose, and there&#xD;
came frightful tales of shipwreck and death, her mother-heart&#xD;
buried him a gain.&#xD;
After John and his wife were laid in the grave, Poverty&#xD;
began to look in upon her, in the shape of doctor's, apotheca-&#xD;
ry's, and grocer's bills; but the courageous old soul faced hIma&#xD;
bravely, until fever and rheumatism lent their aid to the foe,&#xD;
when she was obliged to yield.&#xD;
When she recovered, in some degree, the use of her limbs,&#xD;
she found that, in order to satisfy her creditors, she must&#xD;
give up the humble but comfortable home whose very walls&#xD;
and floors were written all over' to her with household records,&#xD;
and find a shelter for herself and B~essie elsewhere,.&#xD;
Many of the neighbors were disposed to assist her, and&#xD;
some of the most excitable did not hesitate to say that the&#xD;
doctor and grocer were well able to give in the old widow's&#xD;
bills; but she reminded 'them that the doctor had two invalid&#xD;
sisters to assist, and that among the grocer's large family there&#xD;
was one poor little crippled boy, for whom it would be neces-&#xD;
sary to make some extra provision. Ah ! Grandmother&#xD;
Lyman was a thoughtful old 'soul -thoughtful of every one&#xD;
before herself! Some there were who talked of the poor-&#xD;
'house, and said she would be compelled to make up her mind&#xD;
to it at last ; but these were v~y few, for most of the people&#xD;
sympathized with that -feeling of self-r spect (some call it.&#xD;

&#xD;
away from neighbors; but, then, it was in close proximity to&#xD;
the " Seahill woods," where they had permission to gather as&#xD;
much dry wood as they pleased. Besides, as the old lady&#xD;
was wont to observe, " Our trials and our blessings walk hand&#xD;
in hand," and as her infirmities increased, so did little Bessie's&#xD;
strength. She was soon able to go to the village after their&#xD;
slight stores, or such-coarse-sewing and knitting as her grand-&#xD;
mother's rheumatic hands were able to manage. Lately, a&#xD;
kind lady had procured employment for them at one of .the&#xD;
cheap clothing stores that abound in the city of H.&#xD;
Though the remuneration was the merest pittance, yet the old&#xD;
lady's thankful spirit magnified it to quite a fortune ; more-&#xD;
over, it afforded her .the means of teaching little B3essie to&#xD;
sew, and she was already able to stitch and cross-stitch the&#xD;
long seams in the coarse shirts and drawers of which their work&#xD;
consisted, when we introduced her to our readers.&#xD;
The only drawback to this god-send was the long walks it&#xD;
obliged the child to take. He- was five good miles distant&#xD;
from their home, and their employer a man f method, who in-&#xD;
sisted om:having the work brought in punotually at the given&#xD;
time, else it would be given to some other half-starved seeker in&#xD;
this great granary of God. Bessie did not mind the distance&#xD;
in the warm weather, for then the birds sung marches for her&#xD;
in thie green meadows - now slower; now faster --and the&#xD;
flowers sprang up through the turf by the way-side, and made&#xD;
a rich carpet for her little feet even to the entrance of the&#xD;
city. But she could never quite overcome the feeling of lone-&#xD;
liness and dread that caine over her when she stood within4&#xD;
that long, gloomy store in F- street, ari heard the owner'&#xD;

Bravely she breasted the keen north-east wind, occasionally&#xD;
turning to get breath and draw her scanty blanket more close-&#xD;
ly about her, while the withered herbage, coated with white&#xD;
frost, crumpled beneath her little feet, as if a giant pressed it.&#xD;
When she reached the brook where the path turned into&#xD;
the woods, she did not pause as usual to watch the nodding&#xD;
bulrushes, now jewelled and gemmed by the frost-like Thiry&#xD;
wands, nor stop to catch a nearer glimpse of the wondrous&#xD;
"architecture of the brooklet's winter palace ;" for her young&#xD;
heart was very, very sad. The more she thought ~of their&#xD;
scanty stores, and her grandmother's pale, wan face, the more&#xD;
deeply she reproached herself for certain deeds of which she&#xD;
had been guilty, and which now, seen through the chilling&#xD;
atmosphere of want, seemed like wanton extravagance. iDur-&#xD;
ing the autumn, she had spent whole days in the woo~ls in&#xD;
search of nuts. On these occasions~ slie~~d ofteii ~hai~ed her&#xD;
little parcel of dinner with a large, half-famished. dog4hat be.~&#xD;
longed to a poor drunken peddler that lived at the distance of&#xD;
a mile or more on the opposite side of the hill. It was&#xD;
A        thought that the man had stolen the animal in some of his&#xD;
excursions, for, instead of taking kindly to his master, he&#xD;
wandered about the woods in search of game, where he made&#xD;
the acquaintance of little IBessie. At first, the child was.&#xD;
somewhat) afraid of her shaggy acquaintance, but he soon&#xD;
foun&amp;amp;~~ans to convince her of his honesty, and a warm&#xD;
friendst~ip grew upbetween them. For hours, old Jack would&#xD;
~     lie by her basket while she wandered from tree to tree, occa~&#xD;
smonally liftim~g~ his head from between his paws, and, looking&#xD;
round to ~ e himself of her safety, and woe to the mis.&#xD;
ohievousbo dared to approach her basket! Bessie,~whose&#xD;
heart overtlo~Ved with love for everything, was deligiht~d~with&#xD;
her new friend, and bad no other means of ma if~s~iitmg her&#xD;
&#xD;
p.&#xD;
&#xD;
sense of. his' preference than by sharing with him her dinner.&#xD;
True, the meal was rather scant for two, and we know some&#xD;
people, ay, and dogs, too, who would have taken exception&#xD;
at the quality as well as the quan~tty; but ]3essie and Jack&#xD;
could not afford to be very fastidious.&#xD;
Though the child had often spoken of her friend Jack to&#xD;
her grandmother, she had not ventured to acknowledge lAm&#xD;
as the sharer of her dinner, from a kind of misgiving that&#xD;
the old lady would not think it quite right. It~ was this&#xD;
question that now troubled the little girl's mind. il3enevo-&#xD;
lence said that she had done right - her self-denial had saved&#xD;
the life of the poor animal; but selfishness pointed to the&#xD;
meagre bit of brcad in the cupboard, and whispered that the&#xD;
food should have been laid aside against the day of want.&#xD;
So busy was the little girl with this point of ethics, that she&#xD;
did not hear the pattering of old Jack's feet, nor see him,&#xD;
until he rubbed his shaggy coat against her side, and poked&#xD;
his cold nose under her hood, as she bent over her basket,&#xD;
They had not met for several days, and the poor dog's joy&#xD;
was uubpunded. Auci well he might be glad to see Bessie's&#xD;
friendly face, for the marks of the rope on his ch~fed and,&#xD;
bleeding leg, and of the whip on his sides, proved that the&#xD;
faces he had met of late had been anything but friendly.&#xD;
Poor Bessie! Her resolutions of prudence were not~ proof&#xD;
against the mute eloquence of Jack's looks, au~ the next&#xD;
moment the slice of bread was drawn forth from the wrapper,&#xD;
and by far the largest part laid, before her old friend, with&#xD;
the half-uttered thought, "Poor old fellow, perhaps I shall&#xD;
not have anything to give you again in a great while!"&#xD;

of clerks and students; young fathers, with still, younger-&#xD;
looking mothers leaning on their arms, followed by giggling&#xD;
boys and girls, pausing to chat with some old acquaintance&#xD;
equally happy and equally blest; while the children astonished&#xD;
each other by an account of their New-Year's gifts, and the&#xD;
lots of marbles they intended to purchase; while sober, discreet&#xD;
matrons, and silver-haired, benign-looking gentlemen, mindf~A&#xD;
of the time when they were young, passed by with a glance&#xD;
of pleasure and a silent "God bless you."&#xD;
Ah, it was a very pleasant sight! and so little Bessie&#xD;
Lyman thought, when, wearied by her long walk, and&#xD;
benumbed with the cold, she emerged from the sunless atmos-&#xD;
phere of North Main~street into the great thoroughTh~re of the&#xD;
city. It seemed to the child' as if the air Was warmer there,&#xD;
for the raya of the noonday~ ~n fell brightly on the pave-&#xD;
ments, ari4 were reflected from the j ate-glass windows that&#xD;
lined the street; and the feeling was deepened by the sight&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
of s~ many gay an&amp;amp; happy faces. Happiness is contagious~&#xD;
and blessed be God that it is so! else little Bessie Lyman's&#xD;
fate would have been harder still, for very few among Ml&#xD;
that gay throng noticed the poorly clad little figure that stole&#xD;
along close to the side-wall, as if she felt herself an intruder;&#xD;
yet her heart gathered in all the stray smiles and multiplied&#xD;
them by that wondrous process unknown to any save children,&#xD;
until she almost forgot her cold and weariness; and the happy&#xD;
greetings of the New Year, that sprang from lip to lip up&#xD;
and down the wide street, seemed addressed to her, and fell&#xD;
upon her heart like a blessing. But when she left that broad&#xD;
avenue, and entered F- street, the cold breeze from the&#xD;
* ice-bound river almost took away her breath, and at the&#xD;
thought of the long, gloomy store, and the unsympathizing&#xD;
faces there, she shuddered, and the numbness again crept&#xD;
over her heart. A few moments' walk brought her to the&#xD;
door, and, timidly swinging it back, she entered and placed&#xD;
her basket of work on the counter. One glance showed het&#xD;
that there was no one iii the store but a young boy, who.&#xD;
stood at the further end, arranging some goods. ~He advanced&#xD;
towards her, and, feeling encouraged at the sight of hi~round,&#xD;
good-humored face, she told her errand freely.&#xD;
The boy took the work from the basket, counting the num-&#xD;
ber of pieces as he did so. "All right," he said, glancing at&#xD;
the bill which the old lady had placed in the basket. "Two&#xD;
dozen pair, at sixpence per pair, amount to just two dolThr~.&#xD;
Do you ivant the money to-day, little girl '1"&#xD;
"If you please, sir."&#xD;
"Then I am sorry you did not get here' a little ear1i~r.&#xD;
Mr. G-. and all the rest have gone home, and left me to&#xD;
close the 8tOre, for we are' to have a' half-holidq," l~e r~pl~ed,&#xD;
looking up in her face for the first time, as if he 3was sure she&#xD;
would sympathize with h  pleas~we; but one glauo&amp;amp; at her&#xD;
cold cheeks and eyes fille~with tears eufliced to ohauge hi0&#xD;
mood, and he said, earnestly, "I forgot;. yew must b0 very&#xD;

"thank you, I am cold; but but don't you think you&#xD;

she said, eagerly.&#xD;
"I don't think I can. I never meddle with the account~;&#xD;
but stop~- Mr. G- was talking with Deacon 5-.--.- a&#xD;
moment since, just up the .street. Perhaps they are there&#xD;
yet," he~continued, going to the door and looking out.&#xD;
"Yes, there they are by his own door. If you make haste&#xD;
you can catch him before he goes into the house."&#xD;
~ ~eoond little ~Bessie was hurrying up the street, while&#xD;
th~e ~oun~ 4~k turned to his work, saying:&#xD;
"IIoxV much 'she looks like Fanny Lewis; and Fan was the&#xD;
prettiest girl in the whole school."&#xD;
The tgirVs. nimble feet soon brought her to the place where&#xD;
the gentlemen swore standing; but when she saw how busily&#xD;
they wem talking, ~he felt tempted to pass on without speaks&#xD;

and their ~c~t~nty~ store gave her courage. She paused near&#xD;

~t~i~st the plate-glass windows, the very pictures of mirth&#xD;
happiness. There was such an air of comfort about the&#xD;

"We have indeed great reason to rejoice in the success 'of&#xD;
our operations," remarked Deacon 5-. "The pA~ica1~'&#xD;
changes of the last year have given us access to many fields'&#xD;
hitherto closed against us. But, unfortunately, we cannot&#xD;
profit by this great dispensation;* for, unless some great and&#xD;

exceeded the receipts by many thousand dollars."&#xD;

"What are you doing here, child?" he asked, sharply. ~&#xD;

'said~ still more sternly, "unless you wish to be sent there!"&#xD;
'As the poor, terrified child stole quickly a~vay, without&#xD;
daring to lobk behind her, he turned to the deacon, saying:&#xD;
"I ne~r encourage street beggars. It only confirms them&#xD;
in idleness and vice. It is deplorable to see how this evil in-&#xD;
crease~~ith us. Next time the city council meet, I shall&#xD;
bring the subject before them, for it is becoming a perfect&#xD;
nuisan~ But we shall have the pleasure of seeing you ~rid&#xD;
your family at mywife's party to-night, when we can speak&#xD;
further of these m~tters."&#xD;
with a polite rejoinder from the deacon, the gentle.&#xD;
l~Ir.~ G~-~' found a great many things in this world "truly&#xD;
deploi~abl4." He was a well-weaning man, but ignorant,&#xD;
narrow-minded, ~ud conceited. Consequently he often fell&#xD;
into the mistake .of:looking more to the shams of things than&#xD;
the reatity,~aiid this was indeed "truly deplorable."&#xD;
Littl*~ B~ssie hurried a few rods up the street, then7 over-&#xD;
come by disappointment, hunger, cold and fatigue, she sank&#xD;
against ~ brick wall; and, drawing her scanty mantle about&#xD;
her, to conceal1 her face, wept bitterly. It was about the city&#xD;
dinner hour, and that cross street was comparatively deserted.&#xD;
The few young clerks that hurried along were far too' intent&#xD;
ons~ the thought of their dinner, or the afternoon holiday, to&#xD;
treble' themselves about the forlorn-looking object that&#xD;
couched against the wall; besides, ragged, miserable-looking&#xD;
children were no novelty to them~&#xD;
Presently a number of 1~ish laborers came t~ampin~,up the&#xD;
sfreet,'tlxe rosy htie of their hroad cheeks deepened ali~i6st to&#xD;
purple by t.he~'intense cold., As they hurried' along, One of&#xD;
them almost stumbled over the 'child, who 'seemed tohave lost&#xD;
both sight and he in the bitterness of her disapjoint-&#xD;
inent.&#xD;
"Faith, me 'darlint'!" said the man, catching her 1~y the,&#xD;
&#xD;
p&#xD;
#&#xD;
&#xD;
arm," and it 's a pretty time ye have taken to be sunnin' ye'self&#xD;
here like a toad, when the cowid is so great that the l4essed&#xD;
sun himself can't shine, but is creeping behind yon big blsiiket&#xD;
of a, cloud; and the wind is piping through the streets like a&#xD;
thousand Connaught fiddlers, every tooth in a boy's he~d~&#xD;
dancing a devil's hornpipe to the same. There, hinney, trot&#xD;
along wid ye."&#xD;
Seeing that the child made no attempt to move, but again&#xD;
1~aned heavily against the wall, he drew aside her Iwod, and,&#xD;
catching a glimpse of her pale, tear-dimmed face, he' yelled&#xD;
after his companions:&#xD;
"Hello, boys! Bide a bit. The child is ki1t~w~$~wld&#xD;

Mikey Corcoran's rich brogue was~almo~t~iprensibJe&#xD;
to poor Bessie, but the genuine kindness o~ Ii toiie was ~ot&#xD;
'to be mistaken; and, taking courage from~hat and th4 kind&#xD;

&#xD;
PART III.&#xD;
An hour later, little Bessie ha~ left the city behind her,&#xD;
and was crossing the wide, bleak plain that stretches between&#xD;
ll~-~-- and I~1-~.~--. She was so much occupied by the&#xD;
events of the day, that she did not see that the sun was quite&#xD;
hidden Jiy the "big blanket of a cloud," as her Irish friend&#xD;
termed it, nor that the atmosphere was heavy with particles&#xD;
of snow. . But when the great flakes began to fall, she quick-&#xD;
ened her ~ for she knew that her grandmother would be&#xD;
anxious for, her safety; besides~ she much' feared that the little&#xD;
par~J,~in. her basket, the gifts of the kind-hearted Irishmen,&#xD;
w~~ild~ get wet. But she could not out-travel the storm.&#xD;
~Thiekeraiid faster fell the great white flakes, now whirled&#xD;
in her faoe an~l eyes by the wild wind that swept' over the&#xD;
plain, ~no~shzkii~g t&amp;amp; i~h~ earth as quietly as the dews of&#xD;
su~nmer. '~~o~sonie time the child beguiled the weariness of&#xD;
the way by7 notingK'4he increasing depth of the snow by her&#xD;
o~n ~footprints; but she soon grew weary of this, and began&#xD;
to look Q, h~w earnestly ! - for some ~traveller to overtake&#xD;
her, and give he~r a ride.&#xD;
Soon her hands and. feet began to grow stiff and numb, and&#xD;
she could hardly make her way through the heavy snow. 0,&#xD;
how glad she was, when ~he saw the guide-board that pointed&#xD;
to N-! for then she knew she was but two miles distant&#xD;
from . hOme. She paused, and, dashing the snow from her&#xD;
long eyelashes, looked round. It was almost dark, but she&#xD;
knew that from that point there was a footpath, leading&#xD;
4,&#xD;
through the woods, that would shorten the distance a,~good&#xD;
half mile. It wa~&amp;amp;n unwise step; but she soon ma&amp;amp; her&#xD;
way through the drifts over the fence, and began to lay her&#xD;
course hy the well~known shrubs and bushes, for, by that time&#xD;
the snow lay~ even -un the shallowest places, several inches&#xD;
deep.' She soon found that, in the deepening twilight, and&#xD;
blinded by the snow, it was no easy ~xiatter to distinguish one&#xD;
&#xD;
clump of leafless shrubs from another. Still she struggled on,&#xD;
unconscious, for a time, that every step took her further from&#xD;
home than before.&#xD;
Finally she was brought to a stand by a ledge of rocks that&#xD;
rose perpendicularly before her to the height of many feet.&#xD;
Then she knew that she was lost; but hunger, cold and ox-&#xD;
haustion, had so far done their work, that she felt eitherr fear&#xD;
nor anxiety. Numbness and stupeCaetion h~d seized on all&#xD;
her faculties; she only felt weary, and, 0, so sle~0py ~ $tiii&#xD;
she had a kind of indistinct consciousness that~B1~shouhPdie&#xD;
there all alone in the woods; therefore she kne1~ down at the&#xD;
foot of an old sycamore, that grew close by the ledge,' and.&#xD;
offered her nightly petition to~ our Father. This done, ~he&#xD;
yielded to the drowsiness that oppressed her, ~nd laiI hei~self&#xD;
down in a sheltered nook beneath a shelving ro9k.,&#xD;
As she laid her head on the eoidp~ozen rth,'sh~ thoughh,&#xD;
of the little birds that sat in the catnip un&amp;amp;~ the wind0wV&#xD;
the morning before. "God cares for them -~ he will iiot'for~t&#xD;
me," she drowsily murmured, while a faint smile broke t~i~&amp;amp;&#xD;
her l~lue, stiffening lips. Some time elapsed, during ~&#xD;
there was no more suffering for little flessie. She dre&amp;amp;nie&amp;amp;&#xD;
of lying on the soft, green turf, among the sweet wild flo'i~rs,&#xD;
violets, anemones, and the golden adder's tongue, icli&#xD;
loved so well, while above her hovered those sweet angel f~ces&#xD;
so often seen in her dreams.&#xD;
- Presently there was a sound, as of something .wallowing&#xD;
through the snow - a quick, eager snuffling of the air ~&#xD;
few short, wild barks, and then, with a perfect yell of delight*&#xD;
old Jack came bounding through the snow to~her side. :~,&#xD;
Hd~ like hgman reason seemed the instinct of the noble&#xD;
animal! flow tenderly he took her garments in his teeth,&#xD;
and shook from them the snow, and licked her, hands -&#xD;
and her face, too with his warm, smooth t6ng~ie! E~4r&#xD;
extravagant his joy, when hi~ efforts to arouse her wer~&#xD;
croWned with success!&#xD;

"Dear 614 Jack!" murmured the child, as his piteous&#xD;
whining reached her ears; "1 h&amp;amp;ve no dinner for you; in-&#xD;
deed, I have been very hungry myself."&#xD;
At length she sat up and looked about her. The snow had&#xD;
ceased ~to fall, but the scene looked so strange, beneath i~he&#xD;
faint li~t of the wan, .ghostly4ooking moon, that, for some&#xD;
noment~,B~$sie o~uld J~jdly comprehend her situation. But&#xD;
gradua1ly~she r~ ~eevei~ts of the day, and with them&#xD;

"do you t1 in~4~we can find the way home?"&#xD;
lie looked i1~ in her, face a moment, with an expression of&#xD;
abuost hunurn intelligence in his dark eyes, then turned, as if&#xD;
ready to go. She rose to follow hini, but found that she could&#xD;
hardly move het benumbed limbs. The faithfid creature led&#xD;
the way, often looking back, as if to encourage her~ until&#xD;
finally, hi~ unerring sagacity led them to her grandmother's&#xD;
do6r.&#xD;
rY~rshave passed, and Bessie Lyman is now the petted&#xD;
~iythin~ and acknowledged heiress of Capt. James Lyman,&#xD;
who, after many years of absence, returned in time to soothe&#xD;
the last Aays of his mother, and take charge of her little&#xD;
]3essie. One of the first cares of the warm-hearted sailor was&#xD;
to seek out Mii~ey Corcoran and his companions, and reward&#xD;
them four-fold for their kindness to his nieee.&#xD;
As t~ Jack, his irascible master, touched by little Bessie's&#xD;
gratitude and fondnes~s for the dog, made her a present of him;&#xD;
for which good deed he also had his reward.&#xD;
The noble old fellow is dead, but his memory is fait~~u1ly&#xD;
cherished, and, over the fireplace in (~tai~ Lyman~neat&#xD;
parlor, hangs a large painting, which even 1~dwin Landseer&#xD;
might not disdain, and which Bessie delights to point out to&#xD;
her friends as the portrait of old Jack.&#xD;

to behead two captive sachems, who nobly 'refused to betray&#xD;
their chief. The name of the spot still bears' witness to the&#xD;
deed. It is now the site of a fashionable watering-place,&#xD;
but we never pace the broad piazzas of the "Sachem Head&#xD;
House "'without recalling this scene, and it requires little aid&#xD;
from fancy to picture forth the spot as it was at that time -&#xD;
the rocky point, covered with the primeval growth of the&#xD;
forest; the white-crested waves of the Sound, sweeping tow-&#xD;
ard the beach like a train of white-cowled friars, chanting in&#xD;
low, monotonous murmurs solemn masses for the souls of the&#xD;
waiting victims; the handful of soldiers, resting on their arms&#xD;
- worn, weary, emaciated, by their harassing march through&#xD;
the wilderness; gazing with stern countenances, not untouched&#xD;
by admiration, on those stately stoics of the woods, as they&#xD;
calmly~and somewhat contemptuously await the order which&#xD;
shall send them to the happy hunting-ground; while in the&#xD;
foreground stood the English captains grim, gaunt and un-&#xD;
dismayed - the very personification of puritan courage.&#xD;
~e' shall not stay to describe the stout resistance which our&#xD;
viflag~ made to the union of the New Haven colony with that&#xD;
of~neeticut, seeing that it is duly set foi'th in that famous&#xD;
remo1gAr~nce called the "New Haven Case Stated," nor dwell&#xD;
on the zeal with which our fathers sped the regicides on their&#xD;
way towards that settlement, while the l4ng's commissioners&#xD;
sat sipping their "flip~' with the good old Governor Leete at&#xD;
Menunkatuck - for before us lie the days of "Seventy-six."&#xD;
Ah~, reader! could you just sit down ,by 'our ingle-side, we&#xD;

would get the ancients of our village to tell us of the :spirit&#xD;

you should sip your evening beverage from one of 4hose tiny&#xD;

lithe stein served as a target for certain relatives of ours,&#xD;
when with their young comrades they~exchanged, for a few,&#xD;
brief days, the hard service of the camp for the joys of home.&#xD;
Some rods to the east, where the smooth green knoll slopes&#xD;

&#xD;
shall we enter into the details of the bitter ecclesiastical&#xD;
schisms, during which several influential families seceded from&#xD;
the established Congregational order, and took upon them-&#xD;
selves the forms of the ]ilpiscopal church, being duly de-&#xD;
nounced by theiribrmer brethren as those whom Satan doth&#xD;
desire to sift as wheat~ Though the prejudice awakened at&#xD;
that time still continues, in some degree, to tinge the fair cur-&#xD;
rent of life, we shall not stay to trace its effects at present -~&#xD;
for our interest lies chiefly in the grand pitched battle which&#xD;
occurred ~in the centre school-district about the beginning of&#xD;
the present century.&#xD;
The old school-honse, the first erected in the district, in&#xD;
which the village fathers had learned their catechism and&#xD;
conned over Dilworth's spelling-book, had become a reproach,&#xD;
even to consciences usually dormant to everything like com-&#xD;
fort or convenience in school-houses; and, after years of&#xD;
deliberation and much canvassing, they determined to ~erect a&#xD;
new building - one which should reflect honor on themselves&#xD;
and the whole town.&#xD;
epart from our original intention so far as to&#xD;
s~h~t~th~ site of our village is a small, basin-shaped val-&#xD;
le~~Jokped'\oi1t from amid the hills, through the middle of&#xD;
wh1eWt~ ~inall but beautiful stream goes loitering like a truant&#xD;
chfld. This ~stream (we valV~it river) separates the village&#xD;
common from the ancient grave-yard, where sleep the first&#xD;
settlers~ and, crossing the main road, almost encircles what&#xD;
~still eontiii~es to~ be called the new grave-yard, though here&#xD;
and there a sunken grave, with its rudely-s~ulptured slab of&#xD;
red freestone, proves that many. years have elapsed since the&#xD;
first lone dweller was laid there. A few feet to the west of&#xD;
theiold graveyard stood, at the time of which we 8peak, the&#xD;
old meeting-house, constructed after the most rigid puritanic&#xD;
notionS of 'architecture, ~ith~ut steeple or bell, aiA with a&#xD;
multitude~ of small square windows, which gave it more the&#xD;
appearance of a great warehouse than anything else. Beyond&#xD;
&#xD;
this, the open common stretches westward several rods, and&#xD;
here the district decided to erect their ne~ house. Nothing&#xD;
like the little, low, brown house in which they had tasted the&#xD;
benefit of birch and IDaboll, would content them now; noth-&#xD;
ing short of a two-story, two-chimneyed buildhxg, with a room&#xD;
on the ground floor for the common school, and'the one above&#xD;
for an academy, to. the want of which they had become~ sud~'&#xD;
denly conscious.&#xD;
It was certainly a grand affair, superior to anything in the&#xD;
adjacent villages; and who shall blame them if they did~ feel&#xD;
certain pleasant titillations in 'the region of approbativeness,&#xD;
as they gazed upon the belfry, 'suri~iounted. by its glittering&#xD;
~ vane - that belfry from which, alas! no "bell was ever des-&#xD;
tined to sound?&#xD;
As it was impossible to complete ~the building before the&#xD;
period arrived for the commencement of the winter school, it&#xD;
was decided to finish the lower rooms and leave the rest ~sitil&#xD;
the spring vacation. This was done, and a teacher engaged,&#xD;
whose chief recommendation seemed to consist' in the fact tht~&#xD;
he had taught several terms,' was very lippartial, anda~$~W&#xD;
disciplinarian. In temper he was hasty and dogmo~d~&#xD;
like too many of his class, 'seemed to be utterly ~d~fioi~nt~ in&#xD;
that wisdom which seeks to win the lwczrt of childhood, rather&#xD;
than compel the intellect. Ferule in hand, he drove the chil-&#xD;
dren into the house~ and out, he drove them through their les-&#xD;
sons and recitations, and thus he had driven through. several&#xD;
winters, until he received his wages -i- by fi~r the mo~t impor-&#xD;
tant part of the contract with him, for what could he have&#xD;
earned on the farm during the short days' of winter?' his&#xD;
impartiality 'was manifested by punishing,' on every possible&#xD;
occasion, the children lof those 'who were officially conneei~d&#xD;
with the seheol; thereby, as' he thought, showing his' iudepeii-'&#xD;
dence. T1&amp;amp;s not long' before his severity began to give rise&#xD;
to complaints, which' were duly' resOnted by the party in&#xD;
favor of 'rigid di~9ipline; and thus began the great ~ton~x~&#xD;

which swept over the village, like the sirocco, blinding the&#xD;
eyes and stifling the consciences, causing many families that&#xD;
had hitherto sailed the sea of life together to part company,&#xD;
and send after each other bitter words and scowls of defiance,&#xD;
instead of good wishes and friendly cheer~&#xD;
lithiel Chittenden, or, to give his military title and name&#xD;
as commonly abbreviated by his neighbors, Leftenant Ohinnin,&#xD;
had been one of the most active in engaging the teacher; but&#xD;
as long as the punishment fell only on his eldest child, Molly,&#xD;
a beautiful, high-spirited girl of thirteen, whatever he might&#xD;
have thoug~it, he held his peace, only replying to her indig-&#xD;
nant complaints, and hearty wishes that the teacher might&#xD;
slip from the old crossing-pole into the river, and get half&#xD;
drowned, or fall down on the ice - anything~ to oblige him&#xD;
to 1~eave the school with a "Tat, tut, Molly; I dare say you&#xD;
a~e as noisy and mischievous as a flock of king-birds."&#xD;
But when Mr. 2Evarts laid his heavy hand upon his pets,&#xD;
his little twin boys, Joseph and I~enjamin ~- when, week after&#xD;
week, they came home and held up to him their little, fat&#xD;
hands, swollen and purple from the hard strokes of the ferule,&#xD;
his spirit was moved within him. J~e sought an interview&#xD;
with the teacher, and remonstrated earnestly with him on the&#xD;
wrong of his undue severity. The teacher indignantly and&#xD;
somewhat ~nsu1tingly resented what he termed his interfer-&#xD;
ence, and ~manifested his resentment and independence by&#xD;
punishing slAll more~severely every little fault of his children.&#xD;
Notwithsts~nding~ his warlike title, the leftenant was a&#xD;
peaceably-dispo~sed man; it took a good deal to rouse and&#xD;
excite his combativeness; but this object once fairly attained,&#xD;
he ~manifested something~ like the obstinate tenacity of the&#xD;
hull-dog. The circumstance of the interview beV~veen~him&#xD;
and the teacher became known, and their words duiy~repo4ed&#xD;
and distorted to suit the views of the contendi' parties.&#xD;
He explained, corrected and remonstrated, until, out of all&#xD;
patience~ he vQwed (the lefbenant never swore) by the great&#xD;
&#xD;
John Rogers, that the teacher should quit the village, or his&#xD;
children the school.&#xD;
The party in favor of rigid discipline held up their hands&#xD;
in holy horror at this manifestation of weakness. They shook&#xD;
their heads ominously when they spoke of little Joe and&#xD;
Benje, and talked dolorously of the many instances in which&#xD;
children, born to their parents late in life, had been ruined&#xD;
themselves and brought rain on {heir families, all for the&#xD;
want of a little wholesome discipline. On6 or two even went&#xD;
so far as to question whether they were justified inpermitting&#xD;
him to retain his commission, ~s his conduct might tend to&#xD;
produce a laxity of discipline in the militia, thereby endan-&#xD;
gering the character of that national bulwark.&#xD;
The aggrieved party, on the other hand, looked upon him&#xD;
as little less a martyr than the worthy lecturer on dhrinity&#xD;
whose name he had invoked, and they began to look upon&#xD;
the little twin boys with something like the same interest&#xD;
with which they had been tat~ght to view the nine: ~inall chib.&#xD;
dren of that worthy man, as represented in a WOod-cut that&#xD;
invariably graced the pages of the New iI~ngland Primer..&#xD;
9 Those who are unacquainted with that phase of social life&#xD;
manifested in country villages, can have no conception ~of the&#xD;
bitterness and length to which petty quarrels can be carried.&#xD;
Not that the people are worse, but their facilities are better~,&#xD;
There are few topics of foreign interest among them, fe~&#xD;
incidents occur to break the ordinary ro~itine of lil~,~and&#xD;
they are consequently much occupied with leal affairs. Be.&#xD;
sides, there is a certain ch~ss, which is never lacking in any&#xD;
society; the members of which are far better versed in the&#xD;
origin, faults, foibles, weaknesses, errors and faux pas of&#xD;
every individual, than they are with their own; and these,&#xD;
set ou~~by one ~6r two adroit wire-pullers, would breed a quar-&#xD;
rel in Paradise.&#xD;
Moreover, the matte~~ is still~ ~worse where the families are&#xD;
all connected by marriage or blood~ a~ i8 th~ ease with us,&#xD;

&#xD;
and where they still retain, to a degree perhaps beyond any&#xD;
other place in New England, the old English aristocracy of&#xD;
family, the first question with many of our older people be-&#xD;
ing, to this day, whenever a stranger is spoken of, "What is&#xD;
his family - what is his breed?"&#xD;
This, perhaps, is owing to the circumstance that eight out&#xD;
of teu of the fine farms in our township are owned and culti-&#xD;
vated by the lineal descendants~ of their original owners, and&#xD;
the traveller who chances to loiter away an half hour or 50,&#xD;
while waiting for his dinner at the village inn, among the&#xD;
mossy stones in the old grave-yard, may hear most of the&#xD;
names so rudely carved there a century ago, shouted forth&#xD;
again and again, by the noisy schoolboys on the adjacent&#xD;
common.&#xD;
Be this as it may, our village was soon in a great uproar.&#xD;
The teacher, the original cause of contention, soon served&#xD;
only as a central figure in the dark picture, around which&#xD;
became drayv~i,~ m no neutral tints, all the poor human frail-&#xD;
ties of which each of the combatants had been guilty, and&#xD;
some, doubtless, ot~ which they never had thought. And so&#xD;
did it gloom the social atmosphere~ that all grew dark and&#xD;
stifling, until men could no longer see to discern the fair&#xD;
features~ 'of truth a~d charity, and, what was still worse,&#xD;
even wom~u a~d y~ou~ children felt its baleful influence.&#xD;
There~ w~re, uot wanting some calm souls to preach for-&#xD;
baraxw~ aiid. peace,' but their voices were scarcely heard&#xD;
above the din; and even the strongest influence then known&#xD;
in a country village, reverence for the minister, was power-&#xD;
less in this case. The old man who held the pastoral office&#xD;
&amp;amp;t this time, possessed a keen insight into human native; he&#xD;
went from hci~use to house, reasoning, exhorting ftnd ridicul-&#xD;
ing; neither did he fail to belabor them "with apostolic blows&#xD;
and thumps" from the pulpit; but, alas! he' ~livcd in the&#xD;
eighteenth century, and could not cast out devils.&#xD;
&#xD;
The disciplinarians having the majority, and being deter-&#xD;
mined to retain Mr. Evarts in the school, the aggrieved party&#xD;
seceded, and, leaving the new housesavrificing all the 4ollars,&#xD;
cents and mills which they had contributed towards it, with&#xD;
many self-complacent reflections on the similarity of their&#xD;
condition with that of ancient Lot, on a like occasion, went&#xD;
westward some rods, and erected a small, low building by the&#xD;
way-side, which they painted a bright red, perhaps to make&#xD;
the contrast between it and the white one they had left as&#xD;
wide as possible. Their opponents christened it the Revenge,&#xD;
and had not the name been given before it became known that&#xD;
they had engaged for teacher an out-and-out Episcopalian,&#xD;
one who kept Ohristmas, and actually didn't cook for Thanl~s-&#xD;
giving, nor go to meeting on that occasion, they might have&#xD;
called it by a more sinister name.&#xD;
If this unhappy quarrel embittered the tempers and hearts&#xD;
of friends and neighbors, its evil effects fell not less heavily&#xD;
upon their children. Some of them took so completely the&#xD;
tone of their parents, that they would not speak to their&#xD;
former playmates; and others, who neither knew nor cared&#xD;
aught about the quarrel, were forbidden to do so by their&#xD;
parents. None felt this estrangement more' keenly than little&#xD;
Molly (Ihinnin, and Mark, the son of ~ father'~s neighbor~,&#xD;
and, until this miserable contention, west intiz~Me ~friend,&#xD;
Ensign Ross. An unbroken friendship had '~b~~~ny&#xD;
years between the 1~milies of these men. Their ~ were&#xD;
separated only by a green meadow and tfft~ of past~ure, and&#xD;
from~ infancy they had shared their plays and lessons together~.&#xD;
Together they had learned to skate and swim; together they&#xD;
had conquered vulgar fractions, and received due punishment&#xD;
on that same day for singeing the 'teacher's long queue in~&#xD;
commemoration of that event; together they had 'received&#xD;
their commissions in the militia ; .- and let me tell yoi~, reader,&#xD;

sidered an honor not unmeet for the highest dignitaries in the&#xD;
land. Together they had wooed, wedded and settled down&#xD;
on the old homesteads, rejoiced over the birth of their chil-&#xD;
dren, watched their growing fondness for each other; and, as&#xD;
Mark grew up tall and straight as~ a young pine, and Molly&#xD;
like a graceful, beautiful green willow, there was nothing&#xD;
said; but as they watched them coming home from school,&#xD;
full of mirth and mischief, or seated over the brawling river,&#xD;
on the old elm-shaded pole, conning their lesson from the&#xD;
same woefully dog's-eared hook, or disputing about the exact&#xD;
number of words on *a certain page, the thoughts of both&#xD;
sometimes reverted to a beautiful knoll, midway between&#xD;
their dwellings, which had often been pointed out as a fine&#xD;
building site, with a kind of wonder as to whether it would&#xD;
ever be used for' that purpose.&#xD;
Ensign Ross had no child save Mark; and, having th~ fate&#xD;
of several only children before his eyes, he early determined&#xD;
that his boy should not be spoiled by being "babied."&#xD;
Therefore, he never took his part in any of his childish squab-&#xD;
bles, and Mark early learned that if he got into trouble there&#xD;
was no use in complaining at home, for his mother was a&#xD;
woman of too much sense to pet and pity him in secret.&#xD;
Though he heartily detested Mr. Evarts, - and the feeling,&#xD;
to judge from the blows and thumps bestowed upon him, was&#xD;
duly returned, - yet his father knew nothing of the matter;&#xD;
or, if his wife sometimes mentioned that Mark had been pun-&#xD;
ished, he usually replied with, "Ay, ay, and he deserved it&#xD;
richly, I dare say!"&#xD;
Of course he was little inclined to sympathize with the&#xD;
peculiar indulgence which his old friend manifested toward&#xD;
jiis late-born twins.&#xD;
"Considerin' that Molly is an only daughter, and. was for&#xD;
a long time an only child," was 4his frequent remark to his&#xD;
wife, "I allow that they did pretty well by her. But it puts&#xD;
me out of all manner of patience, to see such a. man as Ithiel&#xD;
&#xD;
Chinnin led by the nose by two such imps. Why, it makes&#xD;
no difference who he is talking to; if it were Thomas Jefferson,&#xD;
and one of those precious boys were to break in with a string&#xD;
of questions as long as the moral law, he would stop and an-&#xD;
swer them all. He not only makes a goose of himself, but&#xD;
spoils the boys, and IL must tell him so.~,&#xD;
He did tell him, or at least tried to; but somehow, in this&#xD;
case, his hints failed of their usual effect. The truth was, the&#xD;
leftenant was dimly conscious of .the least possible tendency&#xD;
towards weakness where his boys were concerned; he did not&#xD;
like to admit it, even to himself, and the frequent hints of his&#xD;
neighbor touched upon a sore spot.&#xD;
Ensign Ross was by no means hard or unfeeling. He was&#xD;
naturally genial and jovial, but he had contrived to get certain&#xD;
fixed ideas into his head, especially upon. the management of&#xD;
children, beyond which he never troubled himself to look.&#xD;
"Spare the rod, and spoil the child," was scripture with him,&#xD;
and he wanted nothing better. He was naturally impatient,&#xD;
and could not brook interruption, especially from children;&#xD;
therefore, he often censured as weakness that which was sim-&#xD;
ply good nature in his slower and more patient neighbor.&#xD;
When the teacher punished the little boys so severely, he&#xD;
stoutly defended him, without inquiring, into their offence&#xD;
or listening to their father's explanation, and read the lef~&#xD;
tenant such a lecture on his folly and weakness in all that&#xD;
concerned his boys, that the latter was deeply grieved and&#xD;
astonished. Indeed, upon reflection, he felt, himself, that he&#xD;
had said many things that were unwarranted, even by their&#xD;
long friendship; but he did not like to confess it, and con-&#xD;
tented himself with reasoning after this manner:&#xD;
"If. he has a mind to be mad at a hasty but well-meant.&#xD;
word, why, let him."&#xD;
Chinnin, on his part, thought more deliberately. "If Jon-&#xD;
athan fLoss thinks I, have turned into a natural fool, why, let&#xD;
him seek those tl~at ~are wiser."&#xD;

&#xD;
Thus arose a1 frosty atmosphere between them, chilling alike&#xD;
the ripened fruit of the past, and the opening hopes of the&#xD;
future. Had they been left to themselves, doubtless the&#xD;
memory of the past and a sense of their present folly would&#xD;
have brought back the summer to their hearts; but a rumor&#xD;
of their feelings got. abroad, as such things always do in a&#xD;
country village, and the powers of scandal and schism took&#xD;
the matter up, going from one to the other, watching every&#xD;
word and look, distorting, exaggerating and misrepresenting,&#xD;
until, after a few weeks, they could no longer discern, in the&#xD;
pictures held up to them by these meddlers, any trace of the&#xD;
old, friendly features. Still there were some grains of truth&#xD;
in all these reports; for they were by no means happy, and&#xD;
their state of heart and mind was one which is prone to think&#xD;
and say bitter things.&#xD;
From the day that Leftenant Chinnin withdrew his children&#xD;
from school, they ceased to speak together, for the epithets,&#xD;
"Dotard " and "Busybody," which had been angrily applied&#xD;
to each other on that occasion, seemed to stick in their throats,&#xD;
and prevent anything like a friendly utterance.&#xD;
All through the remainder of the winter the snow lay white&#xD;
and unbroken on the fields between the two dwellings; no&#xD;
path, trodden hard and smooth as ice, marked the constant&#xD;
intercourse of the families; no small foot-prints, deviating from&#xD;
the path at every, few yards, gave evidence of the presence&#xD;
and exploring propensities of Mark and Molly. Although not&#xD;
absolutely forbidden to speak with each other, they seldom&#xD;
met now, - never, indeed, save when Mark contrived to&#xD;
come round that way from school, and exchange a few words&#xD;
with her through the palings of the front fence, during which&#xD;
intercourse he never failed to express a very hearty~ wish&#xD;
that Mr. Evarts had been in Jericho before he ever saw our&#xD;
village.&#xD;
Thus the strife raged through the winter months, until the&#xD;
raw winds and he~v~ thaws of March, came, bringing with&#xD;
&#xD;
them a scourge which many in their secret consciences felt ~to&#xD;
be a judgment for their sins, - the scarlet fever, or, as it was&#xD;
then called, the black canker. Something was necessary to&#xD;
bring them back to a sense of dependence and human broth-&#xD;
erhood. Instead of a blessing, they had made their children&#xD;
a subject of contention, and God in his wisdom took many of&#xD;
them home to himself. The rebuke was felt. Those who had&#xD;
passed each other with stiff necks and averted faces, again&#xD;
clasped hands over the graves of their little ones, and before&#xD;
God's altar, in silence and tears.&#xD;
For a time the disease seemed inevitably fatal; fear and.&#xD;
grief sat upon every countenance; the school was closed, and&#xD;
parents took every precaution to guard their children from the&#xD;
fatal contagion. Thus it happened that Mark Ross was, for&#xD;
several weeks, shut off from all communication with his young&#xD;
associates. He chafed like a young lion in his confinement,&#xD;
more especially when he heard that the fever had seized upon&#xD;
the leftenant's little boys, and it was thought that they must&#xD;
die. They had been great favorites with Mark, and if they&#xD;
were spoiled, ~s his father said, he knew that Molly and him-&#xD;
self were, in a measure, answerable for it, for they had always&#xD;
taken their part, and sturdily defended them, right or wrong.&#xD;
He longed to go over and see them, but he knew that neither&#xD;
of his parents would consent to this. And, if the truth were&#xD;
*known, not the less did his kind-hearted mother and.impulsive&#xD;
father long to go over and speak words of sympathy and com-&#xD;
fort to their stricken neighbors. But submission to his will&#xD;
on her part, and a sense of shame and wrong done and re~&#xD;
ceived on his, kept them both silent. But when the news&#xD;
came that Molly, too, was stricken down, Mark's course was&#xD;
taken.&#xD;
"If father has a mind to be a heathen, and worse than a&#xD;
heathen," he muttered; one morning as he watched the ensign&#xD;
on his way to the woods, "why, well and good; but mother&#xD;
is a Ohristian, I take it. She ought to know better. I will&#xD;

He watched his mother with a compressed lip as she went&#xD;
about her household labor; then, when she had smoothed&#xD;
her hair and drawn her wheel to her accustomed corner, he&#xD;
began:&#xD;
"Mother, Lydia and Tim Linsley, Thankful Harrison, Sam&#xD;
and David Butler, Abby Barker, and ever so many more chil-&#xD;
dren, have died. Do you think that Joe and Benje and Molly&#xD;
will all die, too?"&#xD;
"I don't know, Mark. Sarah Whedon says that Doctor&#xD;
Foot gives no hope for the little boys. Poor Hannah Chin-&#xD;
nin! it will be a sad blow to her .to lose them."&#xD;
"Mother, do you remember what nice custards and jellies&#xD;
Mrs. Chinnin used to bring me, when I had the measles;&#xD;
and how she watched by me and nursed me when you was too&#xD;
much worn out to hold up your head?"&#xD;
"Yes, Mark, I shall never forget her kindness!" and the&#xD;
tears sprang to the mother's eyes.&#xD;
"Well, then, mother," he exclaimed, rising and giving the&#xD;
forestick a ldck, as if to settle his decision, "I think it is a&#xD;
burning shame that we should let them all die, and never go&#xD;
near them. I, for one, am going over there to-day. I am&#xD;
but a boy, I know, and can do nothing to help them, but the&#xD;
children will know that2 I have not forgotten them. As to the&#xD;
fever, if I catch it, I must. One had as good die with the&#xD;
fever, as live in a quarrel all his days."&#xD;
Mark had not miscalculated the effect of his words upon -his&#xD;
mother. She knew something of his determined spirit, and&#xD;
exclaimed, hurriedly:&#xD;
"No, no, Mark! For you to go there would be tempting&#xD;
Providence outright. If you should catch the fever, I should&#xD;
never forgive myself. I will go. I will," she continued, see-&#xD;
ing him begin to button up his jacket. "I have wanted to go&#xD;

self, and I will go this minute."&#xD;
"I promise for to-day," replied Mark.&#xD;
There was no manifestation of surprise when Esther Ross&#xD;
entered that house of affliction - nothing that marked a mem-&#xD;
ory of the bitter estrangement between them; but a warn~&#xD;
pressure of the hand and a grateful look from the over-wearied&#xD;
mother, as, unable to bear any longer the last fearful struggle&#xD;
between life anct death, she relinquished her child into the&#xD;
hands of her old friend, and buried her face on her husband's&#xD;
shoulder. As in birth, so in death, those children were not&#xD;
divided. Death gathered them both in the space of a few&#xD;
hours, and kind Esther Ross (ah, how she inwardly blessed&#xD;
the wilfulness of her boy, that had driven her forth!) smoothed&#xD;
their fair locks with a gentle hand, and prepared their little&#xD;
forms for the grave. Then she sought the room of Molly,&#xD;
where her presence and thoughtful care were like dew to th9&#xD;
heart of the fear-stricken girl.&#xD;
When she returned home that night, an~d related with a&#xD;
mother's eloquence the sore affliction of their neighbors, Mark&#xD;
wept outright, and the eyes of the ensign glistened as he&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"IL am glad you went, Esther!" Then, laying his hand&#xD;
upon Mark's head, he added, "Remember, my boy, that&#xD;
little Joe and Benje are free from anger, and sin, and sor-&#xD;
row, now."&#xD;
Esther Ross knew that her husband passed an anxious and&#xD;
restless night, but she knew, also, that he was one of those&#xD;
who are best left to the workings of their own convictions;&#xD;
therefore, she did not ask him, in so many words, to attend&#xD;
the funeral, and bury all anger in that double grave. Mark,&#xD;
to her surprise, did not ask to go, and, with a sad and some-&#xD;
what anxious heart, she went over at an early h~ur to give&#xD;
such assistance as might be needed.&#xD;

&#xD;
view from the windows of Ensign Ross' house. The ensign&#xD;
had loitered about the wood-pile and yard all the morning, in&#xD;
a restless, undecided manner. When the people began- to&#xD;
gather to the house of mourning, he went into his house, and&#xD;
paced the floor with the same restless step, occasionally join-&#xD;
in~g Mark, who had stationed himself at the window.&#xD;
Mark covered his eyes with his hands when he saw the old&#xD;
pastor issue forth from the house, followed by four boys not&#xD;
much larger than himself, bearing the double coffin; for he&#xD;
could not bear to think that the fair-haired boys lay beneath&#xD;
that' heavy black pall.&#xD;
But his father continued to watch the procession with a&#xD;
troubled expression of face. Onward it crept with that slow&#xD;
and' solemn pace, and there came a convulsive twitching about&#xD;
his mouth, as it filed into the grave-yard, and past a little,&#xD;
short mound, headed by a slab of white marble, a few yards&#xD;
to the right of the gate; for he thought of the sad November&#xD;
day when he and his wife had stood by that open grave, and&#xD;
well did he remember whose hand had gently lowered the        -&#xD;
head of his little flaxen-haired Mabel to her last home; and&#xD;
who, in all times of trial and affliction, had stood by his side&#xD;
like a brother. He seized his hat, and, hurrying onward, soon&#xD;
reached the spot, and gently made his way through the crowd&#xD;
to the side of the grave.&#xD;
When the solemn prayer of the old minister was ended,&#xD;
with a gesture of entreaty he took a shovel from the hand of'&#xD;
a young man, and slowly and reverently sprinkled the first&#xD;
grains of dust on the coffin below. As he returned the shovel -&#xD;
to the hand of the young man, his eye for one second met that&#xD;
of the bereaved father, and he felt that his motive was unde)r- -&#xD;
stood. His hand laid the last clod upon that grave; his foot&#xD;
was the last to turn away and join Esther, who still lingered&#xD;
by the white tombstone of their own child.&#xD;
They pursued their way home in silence, and, when they&#xD;
reached that housp of sorrow, as if by one impulse, they both&#xD;
&#xD;
turned and entered. As they entered the vacant sitting-&#xD;
room, they heard the voice of the leftenant. raised in broken&#xD;
expostulations in an adjoining room.&#xD;
"No, no, my boy; this must not be. We have suffered&#xD;
sorely; and if you, too, should take the fever and die&#xD;
The leftenant could not proceed; and, as they drew near&#xD;
the open door, they saw their own son, Mark, standing by tl~e&#xD;
bedside of Molly, holding her fevered hand closely in his, as&#xD;
he replied, with a -quivering lip:&#xD;
"They have buried up little Joe and Benje, and would not&#xD;
let me see them, but I will see Molly; I 'ye seen her to-day,&#xD;
and I '11 see her to-morrow. I don't care for fever; my&#xD;
father looks cross, and mother sad, and nothing is as it used&#xD;
to be. This quarrel has made us all miserable enough."&#xD;
"Ithiel! Ithiel J the boy is right!" exclaimed Ensign&#xD;
Ross, stepping through the door-way and offering his hand&#xD;
to his startled neighbor. "I have been harsh, unkind, un-&#xD;
christian - forgive me!"&#xD;
The stricken father stared for a second in astonishment,&#xD;
then, seizing the proffered hand, murmured, as he bowed his&#xD;
head over it to conceal his tears:&#xD;
"And I, too, Jonathan I, too, 'am guilty. But I&#xD;
have left it all there," he added, with a significant gesture&#xD;
towards the grave-yard. "Let it be forgotten."&#xD;
And so it was. After a long and weary illness, Molly&#xD;
recovered; and the lives of the families again flowed on in&#xD;
the same current until, as white-headed old men, Leftenant&#xD;
(Jhinnin and Ensign Ross were laid with their fathers.&#xD;
But, years before they died, the white house upon the hill,&#xD;
which they had seen in their dreams, had become a reality,&#xD;
and two little boys had been born there, who, at the special&#xD;
request of the ensign, were christened Joseph and Benjamin.&#xD;
The storm of contention gradually subsided, and the old&#xD;
landmarks became visible. The land has now had rest for&#xD;
many years, and the traces of the old battle are scarcely dis-&#xD;

cernible to any save such curious beings as ourselves. The&#xD;
white school-house, minus the belfry, still stands; but the&#xD;
"Revenge," where we conned our earliest lessons, has long&#xD;
since gone to destruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
NOT long since, while on a visit to some kind friends of&#xD;
mine, IL found myself in the company of several ladies, who&#xD;
were discussing with much interest the subject of education,&#xD;
and the respective merits of several fashionable seminaries in&#xD;
that vicinity. Not feeling particularly interested in the sub-&#xD;
ject, II joined my friend E-, in looking over Darley's&#xD;
graphic illustrations of Rip Van Winkle, and soon became so&#xD;
deeply absorbed that IL heard only the murmur of their voices,&#xD;
occasionally broken by a word or two uttered in a shriller&#xD;
key, seeming like the echo of the voice of Rip's good vrowe.&#xD;
I was suddenly recalled from this ex~chanted valley, by the&#xD;
voice of the fashionable Mrs. W-, exclaiming:&#xD;
"Ah, yes! we will ask Miss R-.--." Then laying her&#xD;
jewelled hand on my shoulder, as if not quite sure thart I wa~&#xD;
free from that drowsy atmosphere, she continued:&#xD;
"You have hardly heard our argument, my dear, but we&#xD;
were speaking of the superior advantages which seminaries in&#xD;
the city possess over those in the country in all that relates&#xD;
to the true finish of. a young lady's education. May we ask&#xD;
at what seminary you were educated?"&#xD;
There was something so bizarre, so ludicrous, between the&#xD;
li~dy's expectant tone and the picture her words called up to&#xD;
my mind, that I could hardly repress a ~mil&amp;amp; as the unvar~&#xD;
wished trQth rose to my lips; but one glance at her haughty&#xD;

exclusiveness, her horror of anything "native to the soil,"&#xD;
and, let me confess the truth, reader, with a feeling strongly&#xD;
akin to cowardice, I evaded a direct reply by saying, "I was&#xD;
educated at home."&#xD;
"Ah! you had ~ governess, then. Your parents were so&#xD;
wise as to follow the good old English custom. I wish it&#xD;
were more fashionable here, for it is much to be preferred to&#xD;
our mixed boarding-schools. I have sometimes thought I&#xD;
would employ a governess for Celestia; but it is so difficult&#xD;
to find one possessing all the requisite qualifications. Your&#xD;
friends must have been fortunate."&#xD;
My folly had brought its reward. I colored, grew confused,&#xD;
embarrassed, and was trying to stammer forth something,&#xD;
when I caught the clear gray eyes of my friend E- fixed&#xD;
earnestly upon me, while a most provokingly quizzical smile&#xD;
gathered around his mouth. All at once my confusion van-&#xD;
ished, and, raising my eyes to the lady's face, II said, quietly:&#xD;
"I fear I have led you into a mistake, Mrs. W-. I&#xD;
should have said, that I was educated chiefly at the district&#xD;
school in my native village."&#xD;
There was a slight, ahnost imperceptible raising of the&#xD;
lady's shoulders, and her bland air of respectful~ attention&#xD;
vanished at once, as she replied, with a slight drawl:&#xD;
"Ah - ahem! I think I have heard Squire W- say&#xD;
that there have been some improvements in the common&#xD;
schools within a few years;" and, turning carelessly away,&#xD;
she began to discuss with' her neighbor the last new design&#xD;
for crotchet that had appeared in the Lady's Book.&#xD;
"Coolly done, that," whispered E-~. "You must re-&#xD;
member that a great gulf suddenly yawns between people,&#xD;
* sometimes, even in this world. For a moment, I feared you&#xD;
would fail to see that little red school-house, of which you so&#xD;
often speak, in the golden atmosphere that surrou~ids Mrs.&#xD;
As other people besides Mrs. W-.- sometimes a~k after&#xD;

because I think" our school" was peculiar even in those days,&#xD;
and partly because i[ wish to daguerre a few traits of one&#xD;
who has long been among the angels.&#xD;
Should you ever chance to visit our village, reader, you&#xD;
will find the main road from the west, for the space of two&#xD;
miles or so, clinging close to the foot of a rugged chain of&#xD;
hills, known as the Tetoket range. On the left, you will&#xD;
have their precipit~us~front, in some places barren and bleak,&#xD;
and crowned by huge old cliffs:&#xD;
CC here, dark with the thick moss of cenLuries,&#xD;
And there of chalky whiteness, where the thunderbolt&#xD;
has splintered them;"&#xD;
&#xD;
and in others draped to the very summit with a mass of tangled&#xD;
green, 'through which rise the heads of the tall cedars; like&#xD;
watchful sentinels. Very, very beautiful is the old mountain&#xD;
in the genial spring-time, when he unftn~ls his leafy banners&#xD;
and displays every shade of green, fror~i the deep bh~ck hue&#xD;
of the cedar, to the pale, faint tinge of the buttonwood and the&#xD;
aspen, with the white blossoms of the dog-wood peeping out&#xD;
from the midst like stars. And still beautiful is he when&#xD;
the frosts of autumn have fallen upon him, and all the show8&#xD;
of summer have deported; when the everlasting cedars,&#xD;
clothed to the very topmost branch in robes of flame-colored&#xD;
livery, stand, like old martyrs, lifting their upstretched arms&#xD;
to heaven, and hinting, not dimly, that God still speaketh&#xD;
froliL the midst of the burning bush, would we but listen.&#xD;
On the right, the open country sweeps southward toward&#xD;
Long Island Sound, but so broken and undulating that you&#xD;
must ascend the mountain, would you catch a glimpse of the&#xD;
blue water. As you appi~oaeh the village, a valley opens, in&#xD;
the midst of which sleep two small~ but beautiful sheets of&#xD;
water, separated only by a narrow, ribbon-like bit of green&#xD;
meadow. Winding arQund these, you may trace green 1ane~,&#xD;

crossed here and there by more public roads, and catch&#xD;
glimpses of the ~sharp roofs and heavy stone chimneys of old&#xD;
farm-houses, rising from amidst clusters of green trees.&#xD;
Not a great many rods beyond this point the mountain&#xD;
suddenly makes a turn to the north-west, and, like the face of&#xD;
a stern fellow-traveller relaxing into a smile at parting,&#xD;
smooths its rugged features, and, with a gentle, loving arm,&#xD;
embraces our village and the valley north of it, known among&#xD;
the early settlers as the "pleasant land~of Goshen." Here,&#xD;
for the first time, you catch a view of the village, which koks&#xD;
like a bird's nest hidden between the hills, and, just where the&#xD;
last undulation of the mountain slopes down to meet the main&#xD;
road, stood the red school-house. I have spoken of its origin,&#xD;
a~nd described its appearance in~ a previous sketch; but I said&#xD;
nothing of the old apple-tree ivhose boughs overhung its roof&#xD;
-tht~t apple-tree, which must, even as a germ, have had a kind&#xD;
of fore-feeling of its destiny, or surely its trunk would never&#xD;
have been garnished with such excellent knots for footholds,&#xD;
its limbs would never~ have twisted themselves into such ad-&#xD;
mirable seats for children, and its blossoms would never have&#xD;
been the earliest and 'most fragrant of the season. It was&#xD;
truly the tree of knowledge of good and evil to us urchins;&#xD;
and many pleasant half-hours did we sit perched up amid it~&#xD;
branches, watching the swallows that built their nests in the&#xD;
belfry of the Episcopal church across the way, or mocking the&#xD;
bob-o'-linkums in the meadows by the river.&#xD;
Moreover, from th~ foot of~ th~ trunk sprang divers singu-&#xD;
larly smooth, straight. shoots~ which sometimes found their&#xD;
way into a certain corner of the school-room, as incentives to&#xD;
learning by the inverse, method.&#xD;
Then, that length of fence under the apple-tree! Never&#xD;
were rails so smooth or so capitally arranged for climbing.&#xD;
Ble~ings on the hand that laid them! Why, our 'sleds made&#xD;
nothing of it, but came darting like arrows from the hill&#xD;
above, and paused not until we landed on the opposite side of&#xD;
&#xD;
the street. But I must not linger here; I can almost fancy&#xD;
that I hear again the sound of the fertile on the window-&#xD;
casement, the invariable signal which recalled us fromi our&#xD;
sports.&#xD;
To my young readers I would say, do not fancy that our&#xD;
school-room was anything like yours, with yoi~r convenient&#xD;
desks, your shaded windows, your globes, cabinets, and outline&#xD;
maps. Ours was a large, square room, lighted by six or eight&#xD;
windows, through ~hi~h, during the long summer hours, came&#xD;
a flood of light and heat so intense as to dazzle the eyes and&#xD;
bewilder the brain of the strongest. Around three sides of&#xD;
the room ran rude desks, to which were attached rough, nar-&#xD;
row planks for benches, and inside of these was a row of sim-&#xD;
ilar benches for the smaller ~cholars. These were witliot~t&#xD;
any support for the back, and all of them so high that not&#xD;
more timn one pair of feet out of a dozen could~by any means&#xD;
contrive to touch the floor. The last side, with the exception&#xD;
of the space taken up for the door, was occupied 'by the great&#xD;
fireplace, which yawned from the door-post to the opposite&#xD;
wall. In these utilitarian days, when&#xD;
"Men scarcely know how beautiful fire is,"&#xD;
such fires as we ~used to have are a rarity. No wonder that&#xD;
the great wooden beam Which served for a mantel-piece took&#xD;
fire almost every day, even though the inventor of friction-&#xD;
matches, on whose unfortunate head the old people of our&#xD;
village lay the blame of all the fires which have desolated&#xD;
city and country for several years, was not born.&#xD;
Ah! those great, blazing, crackling fires will never be for-&#xD;
gotten. The heart of the sailor turns back to them, as he&#xD;
paces the deck through the wea~r~y night-watches, with the&#xD;
rain and sleet driving in his face, while the biting north wind&#xD;
covers hi~'long locks and shaggy pea.~jacket with glittering&#xD;
~icicles; and brightly do they gleam and glow in the restless&#xD;
dreams of more than one~famished, bermumbed gold-seeker, as&#xD;

he sinks down to his last sleep amid the snows of the Rocky&#xD;
Mountains.&#xD;
Of maps, we had none. I doubt whether such an article&#xD;
ever saw the inside of the i~ed school-house, and the Japanese&#xD;
might have been next door neighbors t~ us, for aught we knew&#xD;
or care&amp;amp;, The labors of Ii4ndley Murray, Home Tooke, Web.&#xD;
ster, Ashe, Greenleaf, and Brown, were considered as entirely&#xD;
supererogatory by both teachers and parents. Indeed, so&#xD;
strong was this prejudice against grammar, that, when it was&#xD;
introduced into our schools, some years later, the teachers sel-&#xD;
dom made any application of its rules. We were taught to&#xD;
repeat it by rote, and in this way I studied grammar for sev-&#xD;
eral years, and could repeat the whole, from Etymology to&#xD;
$yntax, without being able to construe correctly a single&#xD;
sentence. In the same maimer we studied Orthography&#xD;
and Prosody, as laid dowr~ in the early editions of Web-&#xD;
ster's spelling-book. I doubt whether any children we~'e&#xD;
ever more familiar with that same spelling-book than were&#xD;
we; not only with the orthography ef our lessons; but the&#xD;
number of words in a column, the number of leaves in the&#xD;
book, the leading word on each page, every typographical&#xD;
error; to say nothing of the hours we spent in studying the&#xD;
beauties of those specimens of art that illustrated the fables,&#xD;
counting the apples on the tree in the fable of "The Old Man&#xD;
and Rude Boy," ~r the exact number of Ilies composing the&#xD;
swarm :Lhat tormented the poor "Fox in the Bramble." In&#xD;
reading, spelling, and arithmetic, we were, to a certain degree,&#xD;
more carefully drilled, and a clear, well-written copy-book&#xD;
was the teacher's and pupil's pride on the day of examination.&#xD;
Thus, with the occasional diversion of "choosing sides"&#xD;
in spelling, and a grand pitched battle with snow-balls between&#xD;
our boys and their rivals of the white school-house, we passed&#xD;
the ~i ters. In the summers, when the large boys wote busyin&#xD;
the-PIds, writing and arithmetic were both laid aside, and in&#xD;
their place we had~ patchwork with all its endless va~iation~,&#xD;
&#xD;
marking, embroidery, stitching, and plain-sewitig. For the&#xD;
qualifications of our teacher in the last, I can well vouch, for&#xD;
I have a very distinct recollection of her compelling me to rip&#xD;
the wristband three times from the first sb5rt-sl~ev~ I ever&#xD;
made, because, forsooth, I did not catch every gather.&#xD;
It is of this teacher, or mistress,~-for the term was peculiarly&#xD;
appropriate in those days, - I wish to speak. I have mused&#xD;
much upon her character, and she ever seems to have been of&#xD;
those unto whom it i~ appointed to be "mad9 perfect through&#xD;
suffering." Her whole life was a combat - a struggle with&#xD;
physical weakness and pain. Hour after hour have I seen&#xD;
her walk the school-room with rapid, uneven steps, her long,&#xD;
thin fingers clenched together, her pale lips parted, while the&#xD;
great drops of perspiration started on her brow, yet not a&#xD;
word of murmur ever escaped her; and, when the paroxysiw&#xD;
was past, her voice was low and - gentle as the south wind&#xD;
after a storm. Her tall, spare figure, and thin, pale face,&#xD;
bore unmistakable traces of this warfare; but there was a&#xD;
light in her great, dark eyes- clear, serene and luminous, as&#xD;
that of the fixed stars -which spake of conquest, and a hope&#xD;
centered in Him "in whom there is no variableness nor shadow&#xD;
of turning."&#xD;
Husbandless and childless, possessing a sufficiency of this&#xD;
world's goods, it was a matter of surprise to ma.ny that she&#xD;
did not seek that life of ease which her delicate health seemed&#xD;
to require. But she feared the ennui and selfishness of a life&#xD;
of idleness; she felt intuitively that&#xD;
"Somethin~ the heart mnBt ~ to cherish;&#xD;
Must loire and joy ~hd-~sorrew~learn ;"&#xD;
-S&#xD;
that no woman can be happy ~ithont some occupation, some&#xD;
interest in life; therefore she took charge ofthe village ~~hool&#xD;
for ~rnany a pleasant summer.&#xD;

if s1~ could not teach the "higher branches," no one better&#xD;
possessed the secret of inculcating in the minds of the chil-&#xD;
dren habits of strict honesty, reverence toward God and our&#xD;
elders, kiiidness and forbearance toward each other, and&#xD;
courtesy~ toward all men.&#xD;
She was fond of poetry, especially devotional poetry, and&#xD;
rhymed 'herself with great facility. Her approbation of our&#xD;
conduct was generally expressed in rhyme, op small, square&#xD;
pieces of paper, ornamented with various devices in red and&#xD;
green ink. But the highest proof of her approval, the one I&#xD;
prized most, was permission to take a small book, which she&#xD;
kept, laid away choicely in her desk, containing poems for&#xD;
children, by Mrs. Barbauld, Jane Taylor, and others, and to go&#xD;
forth an hour or so, with a companion of my own choosing,&#xD;
and lie in the deep shadow of the thick-leaved trees, or per-&#xD;
chance sit perched up in the old apple-tree, while we com-&#xD;
mitted one or more to memory, to be recited on our return to&#xD;
the school-room. Another method of manifesting her appro~&#xD;
ba~ion was to send us forth in parties of three and four,: to&#xD;
cQmnlit to memory the inscriptions on the stone&amp;amp; in the adja~&#xD;
vent grave-yard. On a pleasant summer afternoon, wh~n&#xD;
the sun began to sink behind the mountain, and the si dbw~ to K&#xD;
lengthen, the passing traveller might have seen .half a dozen&#xD;
little girls, wu~ndering cautiously among the sunken grates, or&#xD;
seated amid the tall grass at the foot of some old slab of red&#xD;
sandstone, tracing the lugubrious inscription with their tiny&#xD;
fingers.&#xD;
A friend, to whom I related this peculiar trait in my early&#xD;
education the other day, k~ighingly remg1~ed:&#xD;
"And to these yoti~hful 'Meditations among *he Tombs'&#xD;
m~y be traced your present literary tastes, I suppose."&#xD;
3?oubtless they were not without an influence upon us, for I&#xD;
reniember some curious thoughts and speculations pa~se1,&#xD;
through fll~ bead a~ I sat there, such as I would not lia~ve&#xD;
&#xD;
been likely to have spoken of to any one, certainly not to any&#xD;
older than myself.&#xD;
We always commenced our morning exercises by repeating&#xD;
a poem called "Daily Duty," and~losed at noon witII another&#xD;
entitled "Hosanna." I do not 'remember much o~ either;&#xD;
but I dJ remember how hungry I used to be beCore we got&#xD;
through with the last, which was somewhat lengthy, and how&#xD;
many times I have reached behind me into my dinner-basket,&#xD;
and extracted a piece of cake, preferring- 0, Phoebus Apollo!&#xD;
- puritan dough-nuts to poetry. The afternoon exercises 'were&#xD;
also closed with an appropriate hymn, and, by the way, it&#xD;
should be borne in mind that these stanzas were repeated in&#xD;
as many keys as there were voices in the school. It was not&#xD;
of en that death entered our circle, but when he did claim one&#xD;
of our number, or a child from any of the other districts,&#xD;
headed by our mistress, we followed in due procession to the&#xD;
grave, where we ranged ourselves around it, after the coffiui&#xD;
had been lowered to its last resting-place, and repeated some&#xD;
lines appropriate to the occasion, either written by our teacher&#xD;
or selected from her favorite authors.&#xD;
In looking over the manuscripts of our old school-mistress,&#xD;
not long since, I came across the following hues, which will&#xD;
serve to illustrate her character, as well as the occupations in&#xD;
which she sought to overcome her life-long foe~j~iffering and&#xD;
weakness. They were addressed to a si~t~r, after a "dis-&#xD;

'It.&#xD;
A SABBATH OF 1776.&#xD;
LATE in the fall of 1847, it wa~ my good fortune to spend&#xD;
several delightful hours in the gallery of the "Art Union" in&#xD;
New York. Among the many exquisite pictures that graced&#xD;
its walls, was one which particularly attracted my attention.&#xD;
Not that I either comprehended or was much influenced by&#xD;
the learned and technical criticisms of the connoisseurs at my&#xD;
elbow, but it was a New England scene, "The Fjrst News of&#xD;
the Battle of Lexington," by Ranney, and for it8 truth and&#xD;
spirit I could well vouch.&#xD;
It represented a New England landscape in the capricious&#xD;
niouth of April, with all the shows of awakening agricultural&#xD;
life and in&amp;amp;ust4. A village smithy in the foreground, which&#xD;
I ~oul&amp;amp;~r~ve almost identffied,~under the projecting roof of&#xD;
which ~ood the brawny-armed smith himself, with compressed&#xD;
lips and knitted brows, fastening a shoe to thei~eking horse&#xD;
of a courier (how much more significant the old Saxon *ord,&#xD;
bode), who, still in the saddle, hurriedly told his tale of~4i~ate&#xD;
and fear" to the excited listeners that had already readi$&#xD;
the spot. All along the road were seen hurrying~ stalwart&#xD;
forms, with the implements of toil still in their hands; in the&#xD;
fields, the plough and oxen were left midway in th~ *~row,&#xD;
while their master, without bridle or saddle, spraDg i~pon the&#xD;
~tot$~farin~horse,: and, with his strong hand twisted in hi~ ~haggy&#xD;

I knew many in my native village that might have stood ~as&#xD;
the originals Qf those men; ay, and not a few horses that&#xD;
might, upon occasion, have taken that very look and gait.&#xD;
But more than this, as I gazed upon that picture, the shadowy&#xD;
forms of the white-haired fathers of our village seemed to&#xD;
take the place of the gayly-dressed people at my side, and&#xD;
stand leaning, as was their wont, over their stout oaken sticks,&#xD;
as they told over again their "tales of the times of old." One&#xD;
of these, which that picture vividly recalled, and which would&#xD;
not be an unmeet subject for the artists pencil, I shall attempt&#xD;
to relate.&#xD;
Gne Sabbath morning, during the gloomy summer of 1776,&#xD;
when the hopes of the patriots seemed likely~to go down in&#xD;
darkness and blood, and even the God-sustained heart of&#xD;
Washington grew troubled, and almost sank within him, the&#xD;
people of our village came up to the house of God with sad&#xD;
countenance~ and heavy hearts. News travelled slowly then,&#xD;
and they were chiefly indebted to such wounded soldiers as&#xD;
passed through the village, on their way to their homes, fbr&#xD;
their information of the movements of the army. They knew&#xD;
that Washington still held New York, and the last poor&#xD;
wounded fellow that had reached home had told a~ fearful&#xD;
tale of the state of our own diminished army, and the hordes&#xD;
of troops, uu~Ier the ilowes, that were gathering around it like&#xD;
locusts.&#xD;
~It' ~wasa beautiful mid-summer morning. A light thunder-&#xD;
shower, during the latter part of the preceding night, had laid&#xD;
the dust and given coolness to the air. The rain-drops still&#xD;
hung trembling from leaf and spray, and came dropping down&#xD;
in showers, as the footsteps of pedestrians or the heavy tramp&#xD;
of horses, bearing, in most instances, the double burden of man.&#xD;
and n~atren, with perchance a rosy~child or twpj startledfrom&#xD;
tl~eir~ quivering perches the silver-throated birds.&#xD;
The grain was dy harvested, but many fields of grs~s&#xD;
were still standing iown and sunlurnt; ~nd it w~s voty&#xD;
&#xD;
evident that some of the crops suffered from lack of proper&#xD;
cultivation, for many of the most expert welders of the hoe&#xD;
and scythe had already exchanged them for the musket and&#xD;
sword. Still, here and there a piece of Indian corn stood up&#xD;
thriftily, through~the broad leaves ofwhich the faint west wind&#xD;
rustled with a low, murmurous sound, like the dropping of the&#xD;
summer rain. In the south-west, just above the top of~ Teto-&#xD;
ket, appeared the white caps of two or three of those singular&#xD;
clouds, known among the country people as "thunderheads."&#xD;
But the people, as they pursued their way along the green&#xD;
lanes and over the forest-crowned hills, had other thoughts&#xD;
than of the beauty of the landscape. Their hearts were With&#xD;
their brothers and friends; their thoughts. turned towards Him&#xD;
who is both able to build up and cast down, before whose&#xD;
altar they were accustomed to cast all their cares and trou-&#xD;
bles.&#xD;
As with slow and reverent steps, they filed into the meet-&#xD;
ing-house, and took their seats in the square pews, it was&#xD;
easily seen that the greater portion of the male part of the&#xD;
congregation consisted of men advanced in years, and b~oys in&#xD;
their teens. ~I~he morning service passed i~s usual, and, after&#xD;
a short intermission, the people again gathered to their places,&#xD;
and the earnest prayer was offered, and a sermon, suited to&#xD;
the exigencies of the. times and the wants of the atidienee, was&#xD;
commenced. Suddenly, the congregation was startle&amp;amp; by ~he&#xD;
heavy tramp of a horse, which rapidly approached and~ halted&#xD;
by the meeting-house door. In a moment the rider had&#xD;
thrown himself from the saddle, and stood within the door.&#xD;
Handing a note to the aged deacon, who was hurrying down&#xD;
the aisle to ask the cause of this untoward interruption, with&#xD;
an audibly w~is~pered injunction to act with speeds he as&#xD;
hastily mounted,~&amp;amp;id kept on his way. Tl~e deacon cast ~one&#xD;

&#xD;
the old man finished his sermon and prayer, then, glancing his&#xD;
eye over the paper, he laid its contents before the people. It&#xD;
was a pressing requisition from XVashington for more troops.&#xD;
He was daily expecting an attack from the combined forces&#xD;
of the enemy, and each town and village was called upon to&#xD;
furnish what aid it could. After a few apt and eloquent re-&#xD;
marks on the critical situation of the beloved chieftain, the&#xD;
worthy man continued, "Let us not be too much cast down,&#xD;
my brethren. Our cause is that of truth, and justice, and&#xD;
righteousness; and, strong in these, we shall yet assuredly&#xD;
triumph. This business is urgent; and, I trust, it will not be&#xD;
deemed derogatory to our Christian character, nor an in-&#xD;
fringement upon theholy Sabbath, if we take such measures&#xD;
as seem most pressing, to-day. Therefore, all who are wil-&#xD;
ling to take~ their lives in their hands, and stand by the side&#xD;
of the commander-in-chief, in this hour of trial, will, after the&#xD;
close of these services, please range themselves in single file&#xD;
upon the village common."&#xD;
Then, with hands clasped, and raised towards heaven, he&#xD;
took up the sublime invocation of David:&#xD;
"Keep not thou silence, 0 God! hold not thy peace,. and&#xD;
be not still!&#xD;
"For, lo, mine enemies make a tumult; they that hate thee&#xD;
have lifted up the head.&#xD;
"They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and&#xD;
consulted against thy hidden ones. They have said, Come,&#xD;
let us cut them off from being a nation, that the name of&#xD;
Israel may be no more in remembrance.&#xD;
"Let them be confounded and troubled forever; yea, let&#xD;
them be put to shame and perish.&#xD;
"That men may know that thou, whose name alone is&#xD;
Jehovah, art Most High over all the earth !4'~9&#xD;
There was silence for the space of some ~~ents, an4 then,&#xD;
to the -strains of o~d "Mear," full, clear, ~ distinct, fr~ni&#xD;
tarts of the house, rose the words of th~following hymn:&#xD;
&#xD;
"Attend, ye armies, to the fight,&#xD;
And be our guardian, God,&#xD;
Th vain shall numerous foes unite&#xD;
'Gainst thine uplifted rod.&#xD;
"Our troops, beneath thy guiding hand,&#xD;
shall gain a great renown;&#xD;
'T is God that makes th~ feeble stand,&#xD;
And treads the mighty down."&#xD;
The deep silence that followed the benediction was broken&#xD;
by the low muttering of distant thunder, for the white-capped&#xD;
thunder-clouds of the morning were climbing with ~giant&#xD;
strides up the western sky. Contrary to their usual custom,&#xD;
the people. waited in silence until their p~s~tor had de~eended&#xD;
from the pulpit and passed down the aisle; then the aged&#xD;
deacons moved forward, followed by the congregation in due&#xD;
order. As they issued from the wide doorway, the whole&#xD;
male portion, as if moved by one impulse, took their way to&#xD;
the village common. Thoughtfully and silently, to the roll-&#xD;
call of the booming thunder, they took their places, shoulder&#xD;
to shoulder, and the old minister saw before him the ava~ilt~ble&#xD;
strength of the village, each man capable of bearing a musket,&#xD;
from the gray-haired veteran to the boy of sixteen. Grouped&#xD;
around him was a small band, to whom age and~~ debility had&#xD;
left no available weapons save faith and prayer. One other&#xD;
group must not.. be forgotten - the mothers, wives, sisters,&#xD;
daughters of those men upon the common, who remained clus-&#xD;
tered around the meeting-house door, watching, with breath-&#xD;
less interest the movements of their friends. Love, pride,&#xD;
anxiety, hope, and faith, lit up their excited features; but I&#xD;
trow there was little cowardice there.&#xD;
The old minister's heart glowed within him't~t. the sight of&#xD;
the resolute, dt~~znined-looking faces before him, as they pro-&#xD;
ceed~&amp;amp; to a ch~t~4~f omcers. The subordinate o*lic~~ could&#xD;

all times of trial and sorrow - he who had already aided them&#xD;
to fight the good fight of faith, th~ir spiritual teacher and&#xD;
friend, whose moral and physical courage were undoubted?&#xD;
and, with one accord, they named the Rev. Samdel Eells.&#xD;
The old man was much moved by this unexpected proof of&#xD;
their esteem and confidence. It was the highest honor in&#xD;
their gift, and he fully appreciated the compliment and the&#xD;
responsibility. He had too much of the old puritan spirit in&#xD;
him to decline; his heart was in the cause, and, in a few apt&#xD;
but broken words, he signified his willingness to stand by them&#xD;
in life and in death. Then, beckoning the females to advance,&#xD;
he bowed his head,, ~ like a true Cromwellian, called down&#xD;
tl~ blessing of Heav~non them and their cause.&#xD;

and see that Job Ritton : puts on to mine, Abigail, relict of&#xD;
SamueVAllen not consort~ but relict, just as it is on old&#xD;
Madam Eaton's stone."&#xD;
Here Esther Allen interrupted the somewhat lugubrious&#xD;
tone of the conversation, by taking the younger children ~nd&#xD;
the not legs childish grandmother to their beds; after which,&#xD;
the others drew closer round the fire, and sat chatting cheer-&#xD;
fully ui$~il the hour-glass on the shelf had marked the tenth&#xD;
hour since high noon unusually late for them; but then&#xD;
Isaac's visits were very rare, and he was ever a favorite with&#xD;
his simple-hearted relations.&#xD;
Froni hi~ ~hildhood, Isaac's character had been marked by&#xD;
a4ofty ambition. Though that mind, which took in not only&#xD;
;; the present, but the future, as its field of action, must neces-&#xD;
sarily ~be widely different in its inner life from those of his&#xD;
more contented playmates and friends, yet he possessed a gen-&#xD;
erosity of character, and a winning kindness of manner, that&#xD;
readily disarmed envy, and rendered him not unworthy of the&#xD;
pl~e he held in their hearts.&#xD;
Even the sternest of his Lather's old friends and nei~h~Irs,&#xD;
though they sometimes shook their heads very gravely at what&#xD;
they termed hi~ "carnal pride," and "new-fangled notions,"&#xD;
liked to hear him talk; for there was a kind of charm, even&#xD;
to. them, iii the earnest enthusiasm that marked all his&#xD;
words.&#xD;
We need hardly say how much he was to his widowed&#xD;
mother iuud brother Sam. lie was very young at the time of&#xD;
his father's death; and, ~s ~am was several years his senior,&#xD;
&#xD;
TXIE ~'IRST GRAVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
he regarded him with something like the mingled l~ve of&#xD;
father and brother. Sam was the reverse ef~hi% brother in~&#xD;
many things; he had none of hislofty ~pirations; heeded&#xD;
little for the world, or the world's opinion; but he had all&#xD;
his good-humor and buoyant spirits; and, if he was proud of&#xD;
anything, it was Isaac.&#xD;
He was wont to boast that lie brought him up; and.there&#xD;
was n't another lad in the whole township that could n~a~age&#xD;
a wild colt, swing w scythe, or chop into a~t~e, quite a~ slick&#xD;
as Isaac; and, during his short vacations, there wa~ always a&#xD;
trial of skill between them in aU~orts of labor common to the&#xD;
season. In good sooth, their Uncle Allen, whose good-natur&amp;amp;&#xD;
made him a favorite with them, had some reasOn for calling&#xD;
them a "couple of brags."&#xD;
The next morning, after the early breakfast was over, th~&#xD;
chapter read, and the prayer offered, in the house of I~avid&#xD;
Allen, Isaac started for his home, which lay about a mile and&#xD;
a half distant, saying, in answer to their entreaties for him to&#xD;
abide with them longer, that he had promised Sam to go on&#xD;
to the hill with him that day, to cut the great oak that stood&#xD;
on the edge of a deep gorge, known to this day as the "Great&#xD;
Gulf."&#xD;
"If you want to see what Sam and I can- d~ Uncle Thavid,&#xD;
just~cozr~e along about ten o'clock, and you 8hall~Iear a crash,"&#xD;
hea~e, gayly.&#xD;
am going along up that way myself; by-and-by;&#xD;
and may-be I '11 stop an4 lend you &amp;amp; hand. Y6ti '11 get tired:&#xD;

"Pray be careful, Isaac," said Dorcas; ~&#xD;

the bottom of the Gulf before you think!"&#xD;
"Ay, ay, sir!'~ came ringing back through the clear frosty&#xD;
air.&#xD;
In about an hour. David Allen had drained his ~nug of gin-&#xD;
gered cider, drawn on his mittens, and, standing braced out&#xD;
upon the beam of his sied, something after the fashion of the&#xD;
Colossus at Rhodes, drove off to the clearing he was making&#xD;
in the vicinity of the Gulf. The hearth was swept, the old&#xD;
grandanie placed. in the warm corner, the wheels of the mother&#xD;
and daughter drawn forth, and plied with busy hands and&#xD;
feet, while the somewhat strict discipline, which had been&#xD;
slightly relaxed during Isaac's visit, was again put in force&#xD;
over the younger children. The two eldest were seated on&#xD;
square butts of trees, which served for stools, shelling the&#xD;
bright kernels of the Indian corn into a large wooden tub that&#xD;
stood between them, while the two little ones built cob-&#xD;
houses on the floor, in imitation of the leaning towers of&#xD;
j,    Pisa.&#xD;
:~: Their voices mingled right pleasantly with the buzzing&#xD;
murmur of the wheels and the monotonous dripping of the&#xD;
molting snow from the eaves, and the whole room was in&#xD;
cheerful coritr~t' to the icy winter without.&#xD;
Neither the, mother nor the daughter seemed in a very gar-&#xD;
rulous mood, though they occasionally exchanged a word about&#xD;
some household affair, and once or twice spoke of Is&amp;amp;ao atid&#xD;
his ambitious dreams. Thus the hours passed on; the shadow&#xD;
ondke window-sill had almost receded to the noon-mark, when&#xD;
the oki grandmother suddenly roused herself, and, looking&#xD;
eagerly roiind~ asked, in her shrill, tremulous tones :&#xD;
"Where 's Isaac? Where 's Nabby's boy?"&#xD;
"Iss~o went home before you were up, mother," returned&#xD;
~IsVEer Allen.&#xD;
"Ahwell, Idid n't know what mightn't 'a happened to him.&#xD;
Was n't he talking about shrouds or 'grave-stones, or some&#xD;

about such things?"&#xD;
"Isaac's head runs upon everything, n~other."&#xD;
"Sure enough, so it does; but I wonder what he should be&#xD;
thinking about his grave-stone for, when I have never quite&#xD;
made up my mind what verse to have Job Ritton put 'on~ to&#xD;
mine. Now, mebby that 's what made me dream so last&#xD;
night I dreamed Isaac was dead. Queer~ enough that I&#xD;
should dream of Nabby's boy's dying, a'n't it i?" she Tmuttered,&#xD;
spreading out the palms of her thin hands to the fire.&#xD;
"Dream of a death is a sign of a wedding, mother," said&#xD;
Esther Allen, cheerfully.&#xD;
"Yes, it 's a good sign, but I 'ye known it to fail," returned&#xD;
the old dame. "Many a time have I heard Submit Leete's&#xD;
Aunt Leah tell how she dreamed, two nights running, that&#xD;
Hilkiah Palmer was dead; and, sure enough, he was killed,&#xD;
not long after, in a skirmish between our troops and Prince&#xD;
Rupert's. Kiah was Snbmit's sweetheart, you know. Welk.&#xD;
a..day, this happened a long time ago, before I left home and&#xD;
came over here with your gran'ther. I spose Leak and Sub-&#xD;

"Don't you think grandmother more flighty than usual to-&#xD;

seemed to make a painful impression, as she rose and walked&#xD;
to the window.&#xD;
"She was up later than common last night, and a little&#xD;
puts her out," returned the mother,~as she left the room for a&#xD;
distaff of flax.&#xD;
As she again entered the room, l)orcas turo~Wb~r&#xD;
an ashen face, crying, as she pointed to the street ~&#xD;
"0, mother, mother! He is dead! I knew it 'w~~~'&#xD;

Sam lift a human body from their sled, and bear it towards&#xD;
the house.&#xD;
"It is Isaac - Isaac, another! " cried the trembling girl,&#xD;
clinging to her for support, while the little ones, frightened&#xD;
by her cries, fled to the same shelter,&#xD;
"What 's all this pother about Isaac?" said the old 4gran-&#xD;
dame~ querulou~4y. "Why do you cry for him? He 's to&#xD;
be a minister, a lamed gospel minister. Fie, child! such&#xD;
takings.'on are unmaidenly and improper."&#xD;
But Dorcas heard her not, her eyes were fixed on the door,&#xD;
through which her father and1cousin soon entered with uneven&#xD;
steps, and bore their burden to a bed that occupied one&#xD;
corner of the spacious room. There was no need to gaze&#xD;
upon that mangled face to tell who the victim was - one&#xD;
glance at the faces of David Allen and his nephew was suffi-&#xD;
cient.&#xD;
They gathered around the bed in silence, unbroken for&#xD;
some moments by sobs or groans. The suddenness of the&#xD;
blow had stunned them. Sam's voice was the first to break&#xD;
the fearful spell. "0, my mother - my poor mother!" he&#xD;
groaned, as he stooped his head upon his Aunt Esther's shoul-&#xD;
der and wept like a child.&#xD;
We will not attempt to describe the agony of that hour -&#xD;
we cannot paint the grief that like a gloomy night shut so&#xD;
suddenly down upon the hearts of those stricken ones, eXtend-&#xD;

we need not, for there are few, among those who will read this&#xD;
sketch, over whose threshold the invisible footsteps of Death&#xD;

Two days after, the body of the young student, followal&#xD;
by. aln~iost every family in the settlement, was borne alo~i~&#xD;

young pastor, it was again borne out and laid down in the&#xD;
grave. His destiny was accomplished .- his yearning wish&#xD;
&#xD;
realized - but, 0, how differently from what he had dreamed!&#xD;
His name is still held in remembrance among us, but not for&#xD;
wisdom, or power, or deeds of high emprise - but, as the&#xD;

"Man is God's image, but the poor man is Christ's stamp to boot."&#xD;
"BUT, my dear Miss R-.~----, let me assure you that this&#xD;
sympathy for paupers is quite needless. Where, in the whole&#xD;
world, is there such excellent provision for the poor as in our&#xD;
own New England? The judge, my husband,, who should&#xD;
know something of this matter, says our paupers are much&#xD;
better off than we. They have no taxes to pay, nothing to&#xD;
be anxious about - only to eat and drink, and, perhaps,&#xD;
labor a little."&#xD;
And my good, proper, self-satisfied, s~niewhat aristocratic,&#xD;
but really kind-hearted, "fat, fair and forty" friend, Mrs.&#xD;
Judge Lawson, who spoke thus, sank back on the sofa, into&#xD;
her usual attitude of graceful repose, with a look of com-&#xD;
miseration for my ignorance (I not having borne the weight&#xD;
of public affairs, as' the wife of a judge).&#xD;
'~ Indeed!" I replied; "then, I suppose the judge, and,&#xD;
of course, yourself, would gladly exchange your beautiful&#xD;
house and ~stablishment for a home in the almshouse; or,&#xD;
perhaps, you would prefer being put up at auction, to be&#xD;
struck off at the lowest living price per week, to some coarse,&#xD;
brutal man, whose aim would be to make you do the mq~&#xD;
work on the cheapest living. How much care and ~&#xD;
I XI&#xD;
y~u would escape!"                                 r&#xD;
"How absurd! Of course, there are different station~t*~&#xD;
life. ~. This search for duty out of our own sphere is what&#xD;
creates so ~uuch conftision in the world," replied my friend,&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
with some show of vexation. "But, excuse me, ~ny dear,&#xD;
your secluded habits have not adapted you to appreciate&#xD;
what the judge calls the manifold relations of life"&#xD;
"Pardon me, Mrs. Lawson; it was because I do feel&#xD;
these relations so deeply, that I stood beside that old pau-&#xD;
per's grave to-day, and witnessed the hurried, heartless man-&#xD;
ner of her burial. Our poor-laws may be very wise, but,&#xD;
when I heard the circumstances of her death, IL could not&#xD;
help feeling that the spirit with which they are applied is&#xD;
very different from that of Him who left us the poor as part&#xD;
of his dying legacy. Our social life, though rich and beau-&#xD;
tiflil in many respects, has some barbarism lingering in it."&#xD;
"Heaven save us! What, strange ideas people do run&#xD;
away with!" exclaimed the judge's lady, raising herself&#xD;
erect on the sofa. "I am astonished, my dear, that a person&#xD;
of your correct taste and excellent judgment should indulge&#xD;
such fancies. What could induce you to go to that old&#xD;
woman's funeral?"&#xD;
*' Respect for the character of one who, in very humble&#xD;
and trying circumstances, has lived a true and noble life."&#xD;
"Did you know her?"&#xD;
"Yes." And, catching the inquisitive glance of my&#xD;
friend's daughter, Eveline, a rose-lipped girl of sixteen,&#xD;
whose sense of les convenances I had somewhat offended by&#xD;
taking ber to a pauper's funeral, I added, "If you are in-&#xD;
clined to listen I will tell you something of her story."&#xD;
"0, do, Miss R-!" exclaimed Eveline, snatching a&#xD;
low ottoman, and placing herself at my feet. "I do so love&#xD;
to Jwar stories, and we all know mamma's penchant that&#xD;
~ And, pi~ay, begin at the beginning; for,, when. I see&#xD;
women, I can searcel~y believe that they&#xD;

beautiful, and a goodness of heart and cheerfulness of dispo-&#xD;
sition, which transfigured, as it were, her semewbat irregular&#xD;
features, and gave her words and actions a charm which does&#xD;
not belong to mere physical beauty.&#xD;
"She was the only child of her mother, who died when&#xD;
she was about ten years old. Her mother's place was soon&#xD;
occupied, not filled, by another woman, who, though natural&amp;amp;&#xD;
kind and well-meaning, from feeble health and an excessively&#xD;
nervous temperament, was ill-calculated for the trials, toils&#xD;
and cares of married life, especially when a rapidly increas-&#xD;
ing family, together with narrow circumstances, made inces-&#xD;
sant demands on her health and patience. Of course, the&#xD;
atmosphere of Miles Grayson's house was not always clear&#xD;
and bright as a June day. It more frequently resembled a&#xD;
November fog; and it would be idle to say it was not often&#xD;
so thick and dark that the cheerful warmth of Mary's heart&#xD;
could not gush through it. iBut if she could not always&#xD;
banish the cloud from her father's brow, nor soothe the fret-&#xD;
ful spirit of her step-mother, nor even transform the risi1~&#xD;
group of children into little angels, yet, by the grace of God,&#xD;
she could bear all with patience, which is, perhaps, the next&#xD;
best thing.&#xD;
"One thing is certain-they all loved her. True, it was a&#xD;
too selfish love, that appreciated not so much her unWearied&#xD;
devotion as their need of it. Her true worth they appre-&#xD;
ciated as little at they did the quiet sunshine that stole&#xD;
through the broken windows to glorify their mean room.&#xD;
But, when one is beloved, even in this poor way, the path of&#xD;
life seems less barren and difficult.&#xD;
"Thus passed ten years, for time does not stand still eyen&#xD;
at the doors of the unhappy. Then came deaih~, un~1er 'tEe&#xD;
form of a malignant fever, and carried off the father and fbur&#xD;
of the children. A still heavier burden was now lai4 on&#xD;
Mary. The expenses of sickness exhausted what little prop-&#xD;
erty her father had left; the oldest remaining child, a boy&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
of nine, could do little to aid her; t~nd it was difficult to&#xD;
say which made the largest demand on her patience and love&#xD;
the feeble, despairing mother, or the poor, puny baby.&#xD;
Poor Mary! She saw how much was to be done, and how&#xD;
little there was to do with, and almost gave way in despair.&#xD;
"Besides, there was another sore trial. Like all young&#xD;
maidens she had her dreams of the future; and, for the last&#xD;
two years, she had not dreamed alone. There was one, an&#xD;
active, intelligent young mechanic, ~who appreciated her&#xD;
worth, and who had spoken to her words that had flooded&#xD;
hex heart with happiness. They were both poor. Therefore&#xD;
they had decided to wait until the young iftan could lay by&#xD;
something, before they attempted to realize together their&#xD;
dreams of married life. Mary was, no subtle reasoner, but&#xD;
she had a strong sense of duty, aided, no doubt, in this case,&#xD;
by her sad experience of the miseries of poverty, and its&#xD;
frequent, though not necessary, accompaniments ill-humor&#xD;
and sourness of spirit.&#xD;
"She was deeply attached to this young man; but now,&#xD;
when he came to her, with kind words and loving looks, and&#xD;
spoke hopefully and beautifully of their future, though she&#xD;
laid up every word in her heart, she mournfully shook her&#xD;
head and wept, from joy and sorrow - joy that he was so&#xD;
good and true sorrow that, in her present circumstances,&#xD;
she could do nothing to bless his life or make their dream&#xD;
real; for how could she leave her helpless mother and the&#xD;
little ones for a life of happiness? Would not that little&#xD;
babe, with its hollow eyes and its limbs swollen with scrofula,&#xD;
haunt her, even in a husband's bosom? And how could she&#xD;
consent to burden him with these hapless ones? lit could&#xD;
not be.&#xD;
"The hopes that had blossomed so brightly in her dreary&#xD;
path were too dear to be easily renounced. Long, earnestly&#xD;
and prayerfully, she strove to choose the right; and, to her,&#xD;
this now seemed to be self.renuneiation. I will not 8ay this&#xD;

decision was made known to her lover calmly, or without&#xD;
many tears, for she was a loving woman. But I know that&#xD;
all his expostulations failed to change~ it, and that he, at last,&#xD;
in some measure, felt its necessity.&#xD;
"This trial over, and her thoughts all bent on what seemed&#xD;
duty, the way of life grew clearer' to her. She found a&#xD;
Diane for her little brother With a kind farmer, and directed&#xD;
all her energies to the 'task of supplying the wants of her&#xD;
mother and hifant sister."&#xD;
"And her lover, Miss R-.--," inVerrupted Eveline; "did&#xD;
her lover take her at her word? Did he make no more&#xD;
,efforts to win her?"&#xD;
"He did not give her up easily, Eva. Por a long time he&#xD;
cherished the 'hope of a 'good time coming.' He was good&#xD;
and true, and more than once sought to change her decision.&#xD;
But, as the years went, through the misconduct of an older&#xD;
brother, his own mother became dependent on him for sup-&#xD;
port, and he finally took Mary's friendly counsel, and mar-&#xD;
ried a worthy girl who had long been a friend to them both."&#xD;
"How horribly unromantic and common-place!" ex-&#xD;
claimed Ev~a.&#xD;
"Yes, my dear; but your grandfather was always more&#xD;
remarkable for good sense, than romance, I believe."&#xD;
"My grandfather! You are joking, Miss IR-."&#xD;
"No, indeed. I mean it seriously."&#xD;
" You are certainly mistaken, my dear Miss IIr-.----,"&#xD;
broke in Mrs. Lawson. "It cannot be that you are speak-&#xD;

"'It certainly was as I say. Mary Grayson's lover was&#xD;
no other than your husband's father."&#xD;
"How strange! Now, I do recollect hearing the 'judge~&#xD;
say, that, owing to some reverses, the family ~ at one'&#xD;

what nice times he and Aunt Mills used to have playing with&#xD;
the chips and shavings in his father's shop; and how pleased&#xD;
they used to be with a pair of new shoes, and all that?"&#xD;
I cast a rather curious glance at my friend. For a mo-&#xD;
ment a light frown darkened her smooth brow. Then, dis~&#xD;
missing her judicial dignity, she gave way to the revived&#xD;
feelings of the time, when, as the wife of a promising&#xD;
young attorney, she was rationally happy in her husband and&#xD;
children. She laughed in every feature and motion, as she&#xD;
replied:&#xD;
"Yes, indeed; and how, regularly as the 'day came, you&#xD;
littered our only parlor; and Fred., the little mischief, bored&#xD;
holes in the carpet- all the carpet we had; and how morti-&#xD;
fled I was when Senator Smith and his wife called and found&#xD;
our parlor transformed into a workshop."&#xD;
Rejoiced to see my friend, by the force of memory and&#xD;
love, bursting the chill shroud of conventional pride which&#xD;
for some years she had endeavored to wear, I pressed her&#xD;
hand and went on with my story.&#xD;
"Mary's untiring devotion to her mother and sister awak-&#xD;
ened much sympathy in her behalf among the neighbors. A&#xD;
kind neighbor taught her to weave; and, in those days, when'&#xD;
the wealthiest thought it no disgrace to wear homespun, and'&#xD;
when every young maiden- was required to furnish her linen-&#xD;
chest with the labor of her own hands, weaving, though labo-&#xD;
rious, was a rather lucrative employment. The whirr of her&#xD;
shuttle an4 the stroke of her lathe were heard from morning&#xD;
till night. Yet how few of the good housewives and merry&#xD;
maidens, who admired the firm texture of her cloth, orI~he&#xD;
tasteful patterns of her table-linen and coverlets, understood&#xD;
the disappointed hopes and bitter tears which the poor girl&#xD;
had inwoven with them!&#xD;
"Then came a time, amwl a sore time it wa~ 'when the&#xD;

many months she was confined to her bed, a prey to all man-&#xD;
ner of hypochondriac fancies. The slightest noise, a breath&#xD;
of air, even the draught through the keyhole, she fancied&#xD;
would cause her immediate death. For many weeks, Mary&#xD;
sat in the close, unhealthy atmosphere of that small room,&#xD;
ministering to her capricious wants, or soothing the fretful-&#xD;
ness of little Ellen, while every spare moment was devoted to&#xD;
her needle. At length, God mercifully sent a release, by&#xD;
taking the mother from earth. I say mercifully, Eveline.&#xD;
Look not so surprised, for death is oftener a friend in dis-&#xD;
guise to its victims, and those near them, than we suspect. I&#xD;
said to your washer-woman, this morning:&#xD;
"'Your Aunt Sarah is dead, I hear.'&#xD;
"'Alt yes, Miss!' she replied with much feeling; and then&#xD;
added, 'She has been waiting to go a long time, and now&#xD;
grandfather and grandmother can have their bed-room again.&#xD;
They will be more comfortable, and grandfather's pension&#xD;

"This was not want of affection, Eveline; but poverty is a&#xD;
hard master, and food and room are essential needs. 'For&#xD;
some years after the death of her mother, Mary supported&#xD;
herself and her little sister comfortably, and even laid by a&#xD;
small sum to aid them in case of sickness and misfortune.&#xD;
John, the brother, was placed at a trade, and all seemed to&#xD;
go well.&#xD;
"She had much joy, also, in the thought that her undevi-&#xD;
ating patience and kindness had aided to work ~ change in&#xD;
the heart of her invalid sister. Ellen was not without strong&#xD;
affections, but her temper was irritable and violent. She was&#xD;
by no means a pleasant companion for the children of the&#xD;
neighbors; yet she was extremely sensitive, and their slights,&#xD;
together with the many privations of her condition, tended to&#xD;
produce in an envious, discordant state of mind. As she&#xD;
grew older~tb~se feelings developed themselves more fully,&#xD;
until, at the time of her mother's death, ~he was a V~eZ~y disa-&#xD;

greeable, unhappy child. But pain, that 'G&amp;amp;d-comxnissioi~ied&#xD;
angel,' as one of my friends calls it, is often sent to sow the&#xD;
seed of eternal life; and, watered and tended as it was by&#xD;
the unwearied love ofMary, this seed, in the fullness of time,&#xD;
produced in the heart of Ellen a rich harvest.&#xD;
"She became patient, meek, self-sacrificing, and, by true&#xD;
inward goodness, learned the great secret of making herself&#xD;
agreeable to others. Thus, when the scrofula fell into her&#xD;
eyes, neither she ~nor Mary felt as others who said the great~&#xD;
est of all trials had come upon her. They knew that an en-&#xD;
vious, unhappy disposition is far worse, for that blinds the&#xD;
soul. Mary shed sorrowful tears when the darkness, that was&#xD;
to shut out the beautiful world from her sister's eyes, began&#xD;
to steal over them; but they bowed themselves to this&#xD;
stroke.&#xD;
"Then Mary felt her privations most keenly. She could&#xD;
not bear to leave Ellen alone, day after day, in her darkened,&#xD;
solitary room; but she could not see to sew there, and their&#xD;
daily bread depended on her labor, for their little hoard had&#xD;
been eagerly expended, with the vain hope of saving the poor&#xD;
girl's sight. Every moment she could steal from her work&#xD;
she passed in Ellen's room; it was not dark in their heart~,&#xD;
though the brightness of God's sunlight was carefully ex-&#xD;
cluded; and the shadow rested on their faces. After many&#xD;
weeks, Ellen came forth from that darkened room, bitt totally&#xD;
blinded. She soon learned, by Mary's patient teaching, to&#xD;
fill the quills for the shuttle, and to do many other little&#xD;
things; and thus, humbly and trustingly, they went hand in&#xD;
hand on th~ way of life for nearly thirty years, until the&#xD;
blind one ~~ssed from the darkness of this earthy into the&#xD;
light of perfect day.&#xD;
"Mary was now a gray-haired woman. 'The ion~ years&#xD;
of confinement and ~zcessive toil had broken , ~ponstituti~in;&#xD;

motherly face, became a gladness and a light in all those&#xD;
dwellings about her where sickness, sorrow, or trouble, had&#xD;
taken up its abode. She was an angel to all who suffered.&#xD;
H~r experience 'of trial and suffering had ennobled her. It&#xD;
gave weight and efficacy to her creed, which. she invariably&#xD;
whispered in the ears of the sorrowing, 'We know not what&#xD;
is best; but our Lord, he doeth all things well.'&#xD;
"There are some. gentle souls, who, through the blessing&#xD;
of God, seem to have coma early into harmony with the&#xD;
Highest, whose lives seem attuned to some inward music, so&#xD;
quietly and gracefully do they pass along the ways of earth.&#xD;
Others there are, whose destiny is to be made perfect&#xD;
through suffering. IBy reason of passion and temptation,&#xD;
they are 'without form and void, and darkness is on the face&#xD;
of the deep.' For these there is combat and suffering, before&#xD;
they can begin to utter truly the 'Miserere mci Deus,' and&#xD;
feel that the Eternal Spirit broods over their life. At length,&#xD;
in such souls, the jarring, conflicting elements are charmed&#xD;
into peace at His voice,~ and their sad 'Miserere' changes to&#xD;
the joyful but solemn 'De profundis ' -' Out of the deeps&#xD;
have I called unto thee, 0 Lord.' There ~re others, meek&#xD;
and patient, who, through sins and misfortunes not their own,&#xD;
are compelled to bear the cross always, onward to the grave.&#xD;
These belong, chiefly, to what are termed the 'lower classes -&#xD;
the Helots, the burden-bearers of life. Among these, we may&#xD;
find angels on earth; but, often, not till they die do their&#xD;
nearest friends rightly appreciate them, and discover that&#xD;
they have had angels with them. Mary Grayson was one of&#xD;
the unQbtrusive, unnoticed servants of humanity.&#xD;
" F&amp;amp;r many years before her death, the conduct of her&#xD;
brother John had caused, her much sorrow. He was a good&#xD;
workman, but of an unstable, restless temperament, steady to&#xD;
nothing, but cQnstantly roaming from, pIac~ to place in search&#xD;
of better wocrk or wages. Finally, he married a young girl,&#xD;
whose life ha been passed chiefly in a factory, aud~~~io&#xD;
&#xD;
knew little or nothing of domestic affairs. Matters went&#xD;
badly with them. They both became intemperate, and their&#xD;
large family of children, instead of awakening 'in them a&#xD;
sense of the duties and responsibilities of life, only proved a&#xD;
source of discord and misery. They went from place to&#xD;
place, until, about a year ago, they took up their residence&#xD;
in E-. There the miserable mother sickened and died.&#xD;
John, roused for a while from his habits, remembered his&#xD;
sister Mary, and wrote to her, bewailing his errors, and&#xD;
beseeching her to come to him.&#xD;
was twenty miles distant; 'Aunt' Mary was old&#xD;
and feeble, and, besides, she had never in her life undertaken&#xD;
such a journey.~ The neighbors advised her not to go. Rut&#xD;
she thought of the children, hoped to bless her brother, and&#xD;
went. A miserable abode, indeed, was that which awaited&#xD;
her. She found her brother fast approaching a drunkard's&#xD;
grave, His children were ragged, quarrelsome and ungov~&#xD;
enable. But love and patience can do much, even in such a&#xD;
place; and gradually the discordant elements began to yield&#xD;
to her power. She was like an angel of hope among them;&#xD;
but, it must be confessed, it was sometimes almost impossible&#xD;
to feel or hear her through the tempest of violent passion that&#xD;
was apt to rage there. Her brother died, but she had 'the&#xD;
joy of knowing that he left the world sober and penitent.&#xD;
Her mission on earth was now to close. The next morning&#xD;
after the funeral she did not rise as usual; and when the&#xD;
frightened children gathered round her bed, she was speech-&#xD;
less from paralysis.&#xD;

"But, surely, there was no need of such inhuman pro-&#xD;

"Certainly not; but then she was only an old pauper, you&#xD;
know; and it is not the fashion to be very attentive or deli-&#xD;

"But the laws require paupers to be taken care of!"&#xD;
"Ah! yes; but I tell you it is not so much the laws I&#xD;
speak of, as the spirit in which they are applied. The select-&#xD;
men of E- would be very much astonished if any one&#xD;
should charge them with inhumanity. They acted for the&#xD;
public, and their chief aim was to save their town unneces-&#xD;

loved Aunt Nary; but, in the shifting scenes of my life, I&#xD;
had, for several years, lost sight of her. The particulars of&#xD;
her death I gatht~red from one of her old neighbors, who had,&#xD;

words, "Bear one another's burdens," could not be permitted&#xD;
to die under shelter, like a Christian! "'&#xD;
"But, my dear friend," said Mrs. Lawson, "this case is&#xD;
an exception to the general rule. There are few such cases,&#xD;
I trust. Believe me, if I had known 'her, I would have&#xD;
attended to her myself;" and she spoke with a look of&#xD;
earnest sincerity, that made her really beautiful. I rej~died:&#xD;
"I do believe you; but, until we learn to look beyond the&#xD;
external and accidental, we shall notbe likely to appreciate&#xD;
such ch~raeters. But Eva, dear~ what is it?" I inquired,&#xD;
on seeing Evelino look in my face, with , an expression~ of&#xD;

escape their notice I let go your arm, and slipped behind that&#xD;
great, fat, horribly-dressed woman, to whom you spoke after-&#xD;
wards. But henceforth," she earnestly continued, "I will be&#xD;
wiser. I deem it an honor to have followed that old pauper&#xD;
to the grave, for she seems to me to have been a true&#xD;
heroine."&#xD;
"Yes, my love," replied the mother, "and in that sphere&#xD;
of life, and in circumstances where it is, perhaps, most difficult&#xD;
to live heroically, and yet where, I fear, such lives, are most&#xD;
often found. We will thank our friend for her story, and,&#xD;

canty at me; as she passed her hand caressingly though her&#xD;

whatever came within hi~ clutches never found its way out&#xD;
again. For more than forty years he had lived in the mill,&#xD;
sniffing the mealy air, shouldering heavy sacks, and compel-&#xD;
ling the free, glad waters to toil for him, while, with his keen&#xD;
eyes bent over the trough, with his long bent SIngers he&#xD;
scooped out handful after handful~ of soft white meal for toll.&#xD;
People, said that his fingers were ever ready bent for grasp-&#xD;
ing, but that no one had ever known thena to relax under the&#xD;
influence of charity ~nd human love.&#xD;
Money, money was his dream by day and night - his&#xD;
god; and to it he had sacrificed his manhood - his human-&#xD;
ity. True, after maturely counting the cost, he married, late&#xD;
in life, his housekeeper, to save her wages; wisely considering&#xD;
that she would eat no more as his wife than as his house-&#xD;
keeper, and, besides, in this way, he ~hould gain possession&#xD;
of not only what he had paid her, but also the small sum&#xD;
which she already possessed when she came there. There was&#xD;
one result of this marriage which, although it could hardly&#xD;
fail, in the end, of exerting a humanizing influence over him,&#xD;
Seemed for many years to render him only, more miserly and&#xD;
grasping. This was the birth of a son, whose existence cost&#xD;
his mother her life. It would be wrong to say that the miller&#xD;
did not feel some unusual thrills about his heart. as h~ gazed&#xD;
upon the helpless infant, or a strange sensation of terror and&#xD;
awe as he looked upon the rigid features of her whom he had&#xD;
called wife. But scarce were the clods of the grave-yard&#xD;
pressed over her, when his thoughts returned to their&#xD;
wanted channel, and avarice began to repine that she did not&#xD;
live to nurse the child. It would have been such a saving.&#xD;
But, as Death is deaf alike to the voice of Avarice and&#xD;
Leve, the old woman who had officiated as nurse to t&#xD;
mother was retained to take charge of the child, which thro ~&#xD;
finely under her care, and manifested a fondness for her which&#xD;
gladdened the lone old creature's heart. Isaac, for~ s6 they&#xD;
called the boy, was about seven years old before, Miller Jad&#xD;
&#xD;
thought of sending him to school. Not that the boy was alto-&#xD;
gether ignorant, for Widow Barker had taught~ him the names&#xD;
and habits of the various birds and squirrels that made their&#xD;
homes in the woods behind the house; he knew all the herbs&#xD;
that grew about there,. and th~ir uses; and something too of&#xD;
ichthyolog~* he knew, though if old "Grannie ~p~rker," as he&#xD;
called her, had heard that term applied to ~her'lessofls, she&#xD;
would have lifted her great-eyed spectacles, and rubbed her&#xD;
forehead in sore amazement. Nevertheless, she had often&#xD;
taken him up the borders of the pond with her, in search of&#xD;
greens, or some rare herbs, holding him closely by the hand, -&#xD;
for though Miller Jed seldom noticed him, yet, ever since hi~&#xD;
wife died, he had manifested a great dread of death, and had&#xD;
strictly forbidden Isaac to go near the pond alone,- and pointed&#xD;
out to him the minnows glancing ari4 poising themselves in the&#xD;
clear waters, the rosy~gilled roach, and the slender, graceful&#xD;
perch. Then, during the long winter evenings, the old woman&#xD;
brought into requisition her library, consisting of her Bible&#xD;
and hymn-book, and a strangely retentive memory of the most&#xD;
remarkable cases in Fox's Book of Martyrs, which she had&#xD;
met with some time in her younger days. With these the&#xD;
child became early familiar, and to their influence pe$i~ps&#xD;
may1e traced his fated as a man. He was a bright, g&amp;amp;ntie,&#xD;
affectionate boy, a little more thoughtful than is usual for&#xD;
children of his age, owing to the solitary life he led with his&#xD;
~ld nurse, for they saw no company, save when some farin~r&#xD;
chanced to call to see some very choice specimens of grain, or&#xD;
some poor debtor, whose mismanagement or misfortunes had&#xD;
given the old miller a claim upon his property.&#xD;
How long his father would have kept him at home, with no&#xD;
teacher save his old nurse, if the boy himself had not expressed&#xD;
a wish to go to school, we cannot say. But all through the&#xD;
pleasant spring days the child had seen a tall, spare woman,&#xD;
lea~ling a~ little girl aboi~ his own size, come along the wind-&#xD;

a pair of bars by the road-side. Here, after helping the little&#xD;
girl over, and placing a gayly-colored basket in her hand, the&#xD;
woman left her, and retraced her path through the woods,&#xD;
often turning to mark the progress of the child as she moved&#xD;
down the green lane. And at about the same hour in the&#xD;
afternoon, when the shadows began to Thngthen, the little girl&#xD;
came tripping up the lane, swinging her basket in her hand,&#xD;
and was met, either by the pale-faced woman, or a white-&#xD;
haired old man.&#xD;
Isaac was very curious about these people, and Widow&#xD;
Barker told him that the child was Mercy Ward, on her way&#xD;
to school; and that she lived with her mother and grand.&#xD;
father at the distance of more than a mile on the other side&#xD;
of the woods. "And an old rickety-looking place. enough it&#xD;
is now," she added, more to herself than the child, "though I&#xD;
mind me of the time when the Wards held their heads as high&#xD;
as anybody; though for that matter I can't say but they do&#xD;
now; for old Captain Adam Ward has pride enough himself&#xD;
for ten, generations."&#xD;
Widow Barker was no~ great friend of schools;, she thought&#xD;
it a ~crime, deserving little short of hanging, to shut children&#xD;
up all day to pore over books; and, as Isaac had gained all&#xD;
his ideas from her, he heartily pitied the little girl, and&#xD;
thought she 'had much better stay and 'play with him, lie&#xD;
longed to tell her so; but he was a shy boy, and contented&#xD;
himself with watching her morning and evening, as she skip-&#xD;
ped along by the side of her mother, or with a more demure&#xD;
manner tried to make her uneven steps correspond to the reg-&#xD;
ular pace of her grandfather. It sometimes happened that&#xD;
she arrived at the bars some moments before her friends came&#xD;
to meet her; and, on one of these occasions, Isaac, who had&#xD;
been gathering raspberries along the fence, ventured to ap-&#xD;
proach her, and, holding up the purple fruit, strung after' a&#xD;
primitive fashion, taught him by "Grannie Barker," on a long&#xD;
spire of herds-grass, offered to share it with her. The offer&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
was readily accepted, and when Jane Watd came to meet her&#xD;
child, she found her seated on a large flat stone by the side&#xD;
of Miller Jed's boy, her lips and lingers stained to a deep&#xD;
crimson by the rich fruit, gravely striving to overcO~ne his&#xD;
prejudices against schools. Isaac stood on the spot, watching&#xD;
them until the trees hid them from his sight; then he walked&#xD;
thoughtfully into the house, and, to the consternation of Mrs.&#xD;
Barker, declared he was going to school. Stories of cruel&#xD;
teachers, of great, reckless boys, of perils~ by the way-side,&#xD;
made no impression upon him, and the old woman, declaring&#xD;
it to be her honest belief that the child was "possessed," ap-&#xD;
pealed to his father. The miller seemed struck with th~ idea,&#xD;
and said the child must know something about reading,~writ-&#xD;
ing and arithmetic, to get along in the world, and might as&#xD;
well begin then. Again th~ld woman brought up her fear~,&#xD;
and, when she went:on to speak of the possibility of the child's&#xD;
being gored to death by some vicious anh~al in the street, he&#xD;
involuntarily glanced towards the corner of the room where&#xD;
the dead body of his wife had lain, and said, hastily, that she&#xD;
could ask old Ward's grand-daughter to call for him every&#xD;
day. What proteQt~ion there could be i~i the presence of little&#xD;
Mercy Ward, Miller :Jed would have found it difficult to tell;&#xD;
possibly, even his hard, ~elfish natur~ felt the power of inno-&#xD;

animated his father, when he Thll~at the head of his banl, at&#xD;
the celebrated siege"of, Basing House. *And well ~dict mother&#xD;
earth reward his toil. The valley, or .HQllow, as he naiiied it,&#xD;
lay like a rich garden smiling up to haven, and in th~ course&#xD;
of years he added to it many broad acres beyond' that~circle&#xD;
of green hills. They were a kin&amp;amp;.hearted, upright, rigidly&#xD;
honest race, somewhat" opinionated' perhaps, but respected by&#xD;
all men; and thus three' generations went down to the grave,&#xD;
leaving Adam, the grandfather of little Mercy, the sole heritor&#xD;
of the name and estate. He was very young when hi~ father&#xD;
died, but so truly did his mother train ~him in the ways of those&#xD;
who had gone before, that, when the revolutionary war broke&#xD;
out, it seemed as if the very spirit of old Adam of Ely still&#xD;
breathed in the breast of his descendant. He joined the&#xD;
troops, where his cool bravery, his instinctive military skill&#xD;
and intelligence, coupled with his unswerving integrity, soon&#xD;
won him a commission. When the unrighteous stiife ceased,&#xD;
he returned to his neglected estate, poorer by hundreds in&#xD;
purse, but rich in the love and esteem of his fellow-officers,&#xD;
and the admiration and reverence 6f his townsmen.' Most of&#xD;
what was called the "Outside Land," which lay without the&#xD;
&#xD;
hills, was sold to pay off debts contracted during the war, but&#xD;
the'Hollow remained, and he diligently set himself to repair-&#xD;
ing the inroads made upon it by so many years of neglect.&#xD;
This done, he became more and more conscious of the loneli-&#xD;
ness of the old farm-house, for his mother had lived barely&#xD;
long enough to welcome him home. He was still in the prime&#xD;
of life, and with his high character~ and military fame, which&#xD;
was something more than a prestige in those days, he might&#xD;
have chosen a b~'ide from any of the wealthy families of his&#xD;
acquaintance, with a dower sufficient to have repaired his&#xD;
shattered fortunes; but he passed by them all, and, seeking&#xD;
out Mercy Lindsay, his early. playmate in the humble farm-&#xD;
house, where since the death of her friends she had won her&#xD;
daily bread by the labor of her owu. hands, ~he took her to his&#xD;
bosom as his wife, companion ar~&amp;amp; friend. They had but one&#xD;
child, and for several years this green earth contained no hap-&#xD;
pier family than the one at Ward's Hollow. James was an&#xD;
active, spirited boy, and, as he grew older, the green valley&#xD;
became too narrow for him. He longed~ to go out and mingle&#xD;
with the great current of life, and all~that1iis father told him&#xD;
of his own experience* there only jucreased his longing. It&#xD;
was a sad thing to 'his parents when they beca~ne convinced&#xD;
that a, quiet agricultural life would never content him; but&#xD;
they were too wise to force upon him an occupation which he&#xD;
so thoroughly disliked; therefore they procured him a situa-&#xD;
tkn as clerk in a mercantile house in the neighboring city, in&#xD;
which, after two or three years' service in'that capacity, he&#xD;
became a partner.&#xD;
For some years all seemed to go well. He married a pleas-&#xD;
ant, excellent girl, and two children were welcomed as a veri-&#xD;
table gift from God by them, and, most especially, by the soli-&#xD;
tary old couple at the IJollow~ These children spent much of&#xD;
their time there, and~theirpre~ence seemed to lead the gi'and-&#xD;
parents back on the tracks of their youth. It was pleasantkgto&#xD;
see little Adam imitating the erect, military bearing of his&#xD;

grandfather, or going through with the evolutions of the drill,&#xD;
while the old soldier gave oi~t the word of command. Then&#xD;
his epaulets~ cocked hat and sword, preserved with such fond&#xD;
care, were a never-ending subject of interest to them. How&#xD;
.many times the little boy looked at that tarnished cockade&#xD;
and faded plume, and wondered when he should be big enough&#xD;
to wear a hat like that!&#xD;
Though Adam Ward had not passed through those years&#xD;
of military service without knowing pinching hunger and sore&#xD;
fatigue, yet he knew little of those bitter sorrows which touch&#xD;
the soul. It seemed as if Providence, in its wisdom, had&#xD;
reserved this experience for his age. A malignant fever,&#xD;
which passed like a scourge through the city, numbered James&#xD;
and his little boy among its first victims; and so sudden was&#xD;
the blow, that it was not untiL long after he had seen them&#xD;
laid down by the side of the son of the old Cromwellian in the&#xD;
village grave-yard, that he could realize its truth. His was&#xD;
not a grief to find vent in words; like his love, it was deep,&#xD;
silent and strong, and there came many, many weary hours, in&#xD;
which he was ready to exclaim, with Syrian Job, '~ He hath&#xD;
stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from my head;&#xD;
my hope hath he removed like a tree." The sudden an-&#xD;
nouncement of the bankruptcy of the firm of which his son&#xD;
had been a partner was scarcely able to rouse him from this&#xD;
mood; but when it was found that there was strong reason&#xD;
for suspecting the honesty of the other partner, indignation&#xD;
and contempt came to his aid. But this was not the worst.&#xD;
Not only the cash capital which he had advanced for his son&#xD;
was swallowed up, but examination proved that they had used&#xD;
his name for an amount which his whole estate would barely&#xD;
cover. He knew that this was unjust, and appealed to the&#xD;
law; but it was proved that on one or two occasions he had,&#xD;
in the negotiation of* some small sum, given them liberty to&#xD;
use his name, and, the case went ~against him. None save&#xD;
those whose lives are passed in some quiet nook in the green&#xD;

country, on acres that have descended to them through many&#xD;
generations, can form a true conception of the old man's grief&#xD;
when called upon to part with his farm. Those fields were a&#xD;
family biography. Each tree, shrub, rook, brook, fence and&#xD;
gate, were so many chapters of it, and well he understood&#xD;
their language. 0, it was a bitter trial to that white-haired&#xD;
old man! Not the less so, that these beloved fields were to&#xD;
pass into the possession of one who had never been known to&#xD;
manifest anything like sorrow or sympathy for others; one for&#xD;
whose character he felt a strong dislike, not to say contempt.&#xD;
But what cared Miller Jed for old Adam Ward's misfortunes&#xD;
or opinions, when he saw before him the prospect of grasping&#xD;
at one clutch the green meadows and fine pastures of the Hol-&#xD;
low? He had had his lynx-eye upon it for years; he had&#xD;
counted over and over how much more it might be made to&#xD;
yield than it did under the old-fashioned system of agricul-&#xD;
ture pursued by its ancient owners; he counted much on&#xD;
James' inexperience, and chuckled inwardly when he went&#xD;
into a store; then he began to mine in the dark, like one of&#xD;
the rats of his own mill; he watched all the movements of&#xD;
the firm, and, when he found them pressed for funds, had his&#xD;
agents ready to lend on old Adam Ward's security; and&#xD;
should he forego his long-cherished plan, for the sake of prov-&#xD;
ing himself a kind neighbor? Not he; he would "have his&#xD;
bond."&#xD;
There was one alternative for the old soldier; he might&#xD;
mortgage his acres for a sum sufficient to pay off the debt,&#xD;
and many of his old friends advised him to this course. But&#xD;
his independent spirit could not brook this; he had been a.&#xD;
free man all his life, and would not consent, in his old age, to&#xD;
become a servant; therefore, he let it all go, alL but the old&#xD;
house and a bit of meadow on which it stood. Still the fields&#xD;
retained their old name; for, like the excellent qualities of the&#xD;
ancient owners, it was too strongly associated with the settle-&#xD;
ment and history of the village to be easily relinquished. At&#xD;

the time of the commencement of this story, the old captain's&#xD;
wife had been laid by the side of her son, and James' widow&#xD;
and little daughter, to whom poverty had left no other shelter&#xD;
since the death of the husband and father, continued to reside&#xD;
with the old man, and the industry and good management of&#xD;
the former did much towards lengthening out the old soldier's&#xD;
pension, while the scrupulous care with which she sought to&#xD;
keep~ everything about the house as he had been accustomed&#xD;
to see it from his youth, and the reverence and respect with&#xD;
which she treated him, made her well worthy of the daughter's&#xD;
place which she held in his heart. Little Mercy, how dark&#xD;
that old house would have been. without her! was a sun-&#xD;
beam, a hope that ever went before them, casting a serene&#xD;
light on their otherwise. cloudy future.&#xD;

June, with her rich, vigorous life, and thousand musical&#xD;

"heavenly dt~ys which cannot die," and the sun, as if enam-&#xD;
ored of earth and beauty, lingered on the wesL~n hill-tops,&#xD;
while his level rays streamed across the Hollow, and fell on&#xD;
the wooded range on the east, like a baptisni of fire. The&#xD;
whole beautiful. valley was like an enchanted lake filled with&#xD;
waters of the hue of burnished gold, through which the white&#xD;
blossoms of the daisies~ looked forth like stars. The evening&#xD;

plied her needle by an open window, through which the faint&#xD;
west wind brought the rich perfume of the many fragrant&#xD;
flowers and herbs, that a century's care had collected in the&#xD;
old garden beneath, while little Mercy sat on the door-step;'&#xD;
that low, flat, well-worn stone step, with its edges half buried&#xD;
in the thick lurf, constructing various chains and curls from&#xD;
the long stalks of the dandelions, with which she had filled&#xD;
her apron, alternately talking to her grandfather and mookirig&#xD;
a whippoorwill, that nightly poured forth his plaintive strain&#xD;
from the hedge behind the house. Suddenly she threi~ aside&#xD;
her work; and, turning to the old man, said:&#xD;
"Grandfather, that little boy wants to go to school with&#xD;
me, and I shall like it very much. His mother, or the&#xD;
woman that he lives with, asked us to-night if I might not stop&#xD;
for him every day."&#xD;
"And what boys do you know, I should like to ask?"&#xD;
replied the old man, laying his great hand on her shining&#xD;
air.&#xD;
"Why, Isaac - he said his name was Isaac. Isaac&#xD;
the boy that lives in the house by the mill."&#xD;
Something like an expression of pain passed over the grand-&#xD;
father's face, as he turned to her mother, and asked:&#xD;
"What is this, Jane? Does she meati Jedediah;$ewall's&#xD;
child?"&#xD;
"Yes, father; I should have spoken to you about It when&#xD;
we came home, but you was busy in the garden ; besides," she&#xD;
added, with a glance at Mercy, "I did not know but we had&#xD;
better wait until we were alone."&#xD;
Jane Ward was unwilling to have her chill catch aught of'&#xD;
that bitterness of spirit which she and ~ie~r fat~~eould n9t&#xD;

~4Y on some slight errand, listened with compressed lips to the&#xD;
miller's request, made known by, the old h6usekeeper.&#xD;
"Have nothing to do with them, Jane!" he exclaimed,&#xD;
hastily, as she ceased speaking.&#xD;
"Such was my first thought," she replied; "but the little&#xD;
boy plead so hard, that I could hardly find it in my heart to&#xD;
refuse him."&#xD;
a doub1e~faced imp, like his father, I dare say. Let&#xD;
the children remain strangers. No good ever did or can come&#xD;
from knowing any of that race."&#xD;
"Perhaps you are right, father. But, after all," she&#xD;
added, after a moment's silence, "the poor child must not be&#xD;
blamed fQr his father's faults; and, when I think of him, with&#xD;
no one to care for him but that hard-hearted, selfish old man,&#xD;
I cannot help pitying him. Somehow, he reminded me of our&#xD;
little Adam."&#xD;
The old man arose and walked the floor for some moments;&#xD;
at length he paused before the window, and said:&#xD;
"And you think we might possibly do something towards&#xD;
~iu4dng this child a better man than his father. us it not so,&#xD;
Jane?" he added, with a sad smile.&#xD;
"We could tryr father," was the reply.&#xD;
"Well, you may be right, but I have little faith. I have&#xD;
known Jed Sewall, man and boy, for sixty years,. and I neVer&#xD;
knew him otherwise than mean, grasping and underhanded.&#xD;
]~ut, as you say, his child is motherless; and, as Mercy will&#xD;
have to associate with him, if he attends school, you can try.&#xD;
Let her wait for him at the bars, for on no account would IL&#xD;
have her enter his 'house."&#xD;
It mattered little to Aliller Jed in what spirit a favor was&#xD;
granted, so long ~as. he was sure of it; therefore he hardly&#xD;
listened, to the eot~dition attaeb~ed to this. In fact, he was&#xD;
quite willing Mercy should keep out of his. house, for who&#xD;
knew what mischief Isaac and she, might not commit there&#xD;
together?&#xD;

&#xD;
Thus the children became schoolmates, and it was not long&#xD;
before their little fingers began to smooth the tangled 'skein&#xD;
of life between the two families, at least, as far as Isaac was&#xD;
concerned. He often waited op the fiat stone by the bars,&#xD;
until Mercy's friends came to meet her; and, perhaps, as~ with&#xD;
Jane Ward, the memory of little Adam ~plead in the old&#xD;
soldier's heart for the child, quite as much as his own ingenu-&#xD;
ous face and winning manners; at any rate, the old Znan's&#xD;
prejudice wore~ slowly away; and, as the weeks passed on,&#xD;
Isaac became not only a frequent but a welcome guest at the*&#xD;
Hollow, though, in obedience to her grandfather's commaj4,&#xD;
Mercy's foot had never crossed his father's threshold.&#xD;
And with this arrangement Miller Jed was content; for,&#xD;
with all his contempt of the Wards, and what he termed their&#xD;
bad management, he could not escape feeling a kind of respect&#xD;
for them; besides, if the boy was there; he would be out of&#xD;
mischief at home.&#xD;
It was not often that the shrewd old miller had recourse to&#xD;
the law; but when Isaac was about fifteen years old, finding&#xD;
the validity of certain mortgages in his possession questioned,&#xD;
he placed the business in the hands of ~n attorney. The c~&#xD;
was decided against him; and so exasperated was he by the&#xD;
loss, and the round fees demanded by his luwyer,~that he&#xD;
swore henceforth he would have~a lawyer of hi~ own. Tile,&#xD;
had one son, and he should be a lawyer. Like all peop~&#xD;
with only one idea in their heads, this became a manh~. ~wi&amp;amp;.&#xD;
him. True, it would cost a sight of money to educate Idni,'&#xD;
but then Isaac would get it all back. Lawyer~ could not only&#xD;
look sharp after their own property, but their very w~rd~&#xD;
were gold. Miller Jed retained ~ very vivid memory o*~ t14&#xD;
sum he had paid into the hands of Sq~iire G-~.-, and ~ain&#xD;
and again he computed Io~ many such; s~iins he Wou~l4&#xD;

preparatory to entering on a course of law, under the tuition&#xD;
of the somewhat celebrated Judge G-, of IL&#xD;
It never occurred to him to consult the taste of his child&#xD;
in this choice of an occupation; but, happily, Isaac loved&#xD;
books better than' anything else in the world, save Mercy,&#xD;
whose sweet face had gz~own to be a most rare book to him,&#xD;
ever fresh and new; therefore he made no objection.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
"Let it be so. The barbarous Soythian,&#xD;
Or he that makes his generation messes&#xD;
To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom&#xD;
Be as well neighbored, pitied, and relieved,&#xD;
As thou."&#xD;
&#xD;
Six years passed, eager, anxious, bustling years, with&#xD;
NIiller Jed, during which he had, spider-like, put forth many&#xD;
a cunningly-laid thread around the feet of needy debtors,&#xD;
which would eventually draw them within his clutches; then,&#xD;
the simpletons! if they made any outcry, Isaac would be&#xD;
ready to deal with them. In company with such thoughts as&#xD;
these, the old miser's heart seemed growing hard as his nether&#xD;
millstone. With the family at the Hollow these years had&#xD;
gone by "as still as stars." The tall figure of the old soldier&#xD;
was still unbent, though he leaned oftener than of yore on his&#xD;
aiF er-headed cane, the gift of a brother officer, as he passed&#xD;
along on his way to meeting on 'a sunny Sabbath. A few&#xD;
white hairs gleamed upon the widow's temples, while Mercy&#xD;
had shot up tall and graceful as a green willow.&#xD;
They, had counted time only by Isaac's vacations; for then&#xD;
Jiollow regained the old golden glow of sunshine, some of'&#xD;
which, it seemed, he' took with him at his departure. His&#xD;
vacations were mostly spent there, for his own home seemed&#xD;
cheerless and uncomfortable. Even Widow Barker's kind&#xD;
old wrinkled face failed to me~t him at last, for her inoreas-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing infirmities had compelled her to give up her trust, and her&#xD;
place was occupied by a stranger. Though his father felt a&#xD;
kind of pride in him, and did not fail to manifest toward him&#xD;
that kind of respect which ignorance not infrequently pays to&#xD;
talent, especially talent which can command money, not a&#xD;
single day passed in which the son did not feel, with a trou-&#xD;
ble which made him sick at heart, the meanness and selfish-&#xD;
ness of his father's character. Every visit home deepened this&#xD;
feeling, and servi3d to convince him that he never could con-&#xD;
sent to become the mean, pettifogging character for which 'his&#xD;
father designed him. Even the profession itself began to&#xD;
grow repulsive to him; and, restless, dissatisfied and unhappy,&#xD;
he entered upon the last half-year of his term.&#xD;
About this time commenced that seemingly new movement&#xD;
in the life of the churches of New England, known under the&#xD;
name of" Revivals of Religion." The movement soon reached&#xD;
IL , and Isaac and his fellow-students were numbered&#xD;
among the converts.&#xD;
Then, how different seemed life, with all its aims and ends,&#xD;
stretching into eternity! If his father's life and opinions&#xD;
looked poor and contemptible to him before, what were they&#xD;
now, in the light of his newly-awakened feelings? How wil-&#xD;
lingly would he have laid down his life to have made his father&#xD;
conscious of their wickedness! He felt that he must see it;&#xD;
he could not fail to do so, God's law was so plain. He would~&#xD;
strive with him as never yet child strove with a f'athet', ~d&#xD;
then, casting aside all worldly ambition, joyfully go forth as a&#xD;
missionary, to speak the words of life unto the suffering mu.,.,&#xD;
lions of earth.&#xD;
Thus, in words' steeped in the glowing enthusia~~f hi~&#xD;
own heart, he wrote to his father and the family at the aol-&#xD;
low; for, though the close of his term was near at' hand,, his&#xD;
ardor could brook no delay.&#xD;
The Wards received the tidings with ui~igned pleasure. ~&#xD;
They felt that his talents wer~ much be1~ter adapted to the&#xD;

pulpit than the bar, and they rejoiced in the consciousness&#xD;
that their teachings and influence had not been in vain. It&#xD;
was not so with Miller Jed. Not until he had read, the letter&#xD;
over three times, and carefully examined the handwriting,&#xD;
would he believe that he was not the object of some hoax.&#xD;
That Isaac should really think of opposing his will, he could&#xD;
not comprehend.&#xD;
~' Fool ! ", he muttered, contemptuously; "does he think I&#xD;
~m going to throw away so much money on a poor chanting&#xD;
priest? Ay, I see it all now," he continued, suddenly turn-&#xD;
ing pale with rage; "this is old Ward's scheming. He thinks&#xD;
to marry his grandchild to this whining fool, and so regain&#xD;
his estate. 1 '11 see the devil have them all first, the poverty.&#xD;
stricken old rascal! He called me cheat once; we '11 see who&#xD;
will cheat or be cheated, now. I '11 fix matters for them!"&#xD;
and shutting the water-gate with a violence that brought the&#xD;
great wheel to a sudden stand, and threw the glittering water&#xD;
in miniature cascades from every black rib of its skeleton&#xD;
frame, he settled his white hat more firmly on his powdered&#xD;
head, and sped, like a great gray moth, through the shadowy&#xD;
forest, toward Ward's Hollow.&#xD;
Had the prince'of darkness himself suddenly appeared on&#xD;
the threshold of that old farm-house, his appearance would&#xD;
hardly have been greeted with more surprise. The old sol-&#xD;
dier arose, as did also the mother and daughter, and stood&#xD;
~ilerit from astonishment. But they did not wait long, for the&#xD;
ola miller, without stopping for ceremony, began to pour forth&#xD;
~u~h a torrent ot anger, invective, and furious vituperation,&#xD;
a~ those old walls had never heard before. When he men-&#xD;
tioned the name of Mercy, in connection with their designs on&#xD;
his son, the hitherto flushed cheek of the girl grew pale as&#xD;
death, and she clung to her mother for support. Not so with&#xD;
the old soldier; all' the spirit of "seventy-six" seemed t~ swell&#xD;
in his veins, as with compressed lips he listened to the old&#xD;
miser'~ tirade. When th~ milker was fairly out of breath, he&#xD;
&#xD;
drew up his tall, stately form to its full height, and said, in ~.&#xD;
voice which rung with the strength and clearness of youth:&#xD;
"Are you mad, old man? I seek to wed one of my race&#xD;
with a Sewall! IDo you know of whom you speak - or what&#xD;
you say? Begone!" he added, with a commanding gesture&#xD;
towards the door; "begone, I say, and pollute neither my&#xD;
house nor my sight any'longer!"&#xD;
There was something in the mien and tone of that 014 ~9V&#xD;
dier, before which the brazen spirit of Miller Jed quaiJKe4.&#xD;
Thus it had ever been in all their intercourse; he could not&#xD;
help feeling it, and he hated him so much the more. He&#xD;
withdrew as suddenly and as silently as he had entered, and,&#xD;
until his dusty figure was quite hidden behind the hills, not a&#xD;
word was spoken by the inmates of the old farm-house., Th~n~&#xD;
the old man said, thoughtfully:&#xD;
"My children, Isaac Sewall must come here no more. I&#xD;
said no good would come out of it, at first; and it seems I w~s&#xD;
right. Pardon me, Jane," he continued; "I am, Qver4iasty.&#xD;
Good has come of it. Isaac will be a better, wiser, truer&#xD;
man, for the teachings he has received from you, and God be&#xD;
praised that it is so! Still, we must make up our minds to see&#xD;
him no more. It will be a sad trial to him and to us, for&#xD;
somehow the boy has become very near tome; but better&#xD;
bear this, than the slightest suspicion of scheming for the end&#xD;
of which that old man spoke."&#xD;
As usual, they questioned not his wisdom, nevertheIess~ t~1i~&#xD;
heart of Jane Ward yearned after the child of her ~do~io~,&#xD;
and Mercy borrowed deeply but silently, at the thought ~f&#xD;
meeting him no more. About a week after his fathers visit&#xD;
to the Hollow, Isaac, with a heart teeming with hope&#xD;
and faith, came up the green lane, paused a few moments on&#xD;
the flat stone by the bars, where he had first met with Mercy,&#xD;
then passed on to his father's house. Miller Jed, save when&#xD;
under the influence of some ungovernable burst of anger, was&#xD;

upon his eon's 'whims, for he had one argument, of the potency&#xD;
of which he had not the slightest doubt. Therefore, he greeted&#xD;
him in his usual brief way, and listened in dogged silence&#xD;
while Isaac spoke humbly, but eloquently, of the change in&#xD;
hi~views,, and of his hopes and wishes for the future; and, at&#xD;
his usual early hour, retired to his bed without a word of com-&#xD;
ment. The young man found hope in his silence, and fer-&#xD;
vently thanked God for disposing his father's heart to listen&#xD;
favorably to his request.&#xD;
The next morning, instead of going to the mill as usual, the&#xD;
old man was busy for some time in his own room. Pre~ently&#xD;
he called for Isaac to ,join l~im, and, laying before him upon the&#xD;
table a great, black leather pocket-book, stuffed to bursting&#xD;
with papers of all hues, bade him see whether his "school&#xD;
larnin"' could tell how much those papers were worth. The&#xD;
spider-like old miller seated himself at one end of the table,&#xD;
and kept his glittering eyes steadily on his prey, while Isaac,&#xD;
pencil in hand, examined the different notes and mortgages,&#xD;
and made an estimate of their amount.&#xD;
"Nine thousand seven hundred and sixty dollars," he said&#xD;
at length, running his pencil again up the column of figures,&#xD;
to see that they were correct.&#xD;
"Right, nine thousand seven hundred and sixty dollars,"&#xD;
4&#xD;
repeated the old spider; "and this year's interest will make&#xD;
it a trifle over ten thousand. A pretty nest-egg that, Isaac!&#xD;
I Wonder if any minister can show as good a one ?" he added,&#xD;
with a wily glance, at his son, as with his crooked fingers he&#xD;
tenderly replaced the papers in the queer old receptacle.&#xD;
"Perhaps not," was the reply; "they are men who live&#xD;
with a higher aim than to lay up treasures on earth. Theirs&#xD;
is, I trust, in heaven."&#xD;
"Ay, I, for one, am pretty sure it a'n't here," chuckled the&#xD;
old man; "but come, boy, I want you to go up the hill with me."&#xD;
Carefully placing the old pocket-book in the breast pocket&#xD;
of his coat, he led the way through the dewy fields in silence.&#xD;
&#xD;
When they reached the highest point of the ridge that over-&#xD;
looked Ward's Hollow, for the first time the old man paused.&#xD;
It was a beautiful scene that lay before them. On the east&#xD;
stretched out the deep, green woods, along the further edge of&#xD;
which crept the winding mill-stream, until, meeting the resist-&#xD;
ance of the heavy dam, its waters recoiled upon themselves,&#xD;
and lay spread out in motionless' silence, like a young heart&#xD;
when it first finds its love and trust dishonored. On the west'&#xD;
lay the green Hollow, over whose rich midsummer beauty&#xD;
streamed those pensive gleams of golden light, the first faint&#xD;
prophecy of autumn. Isaac gazed abroad with a full heart.&#xD;
Like that heart, nature seemed overflowing with love. A&#xD;
benediction seemed to breathe forth from everything, and he&#xD;
blessed God for life - ay, even for breath. He thought of&#xD;
Mercy,-of his silent but ever deepening love for her, -of the&#xD;
time when he might fold her to his heart as the crown of all&#xD;
blessings; then a rude hand was laid upon his shoulder, andy&#xD;
his father's shrill tones fell upon his ears.&#xD;
"It is a goodly bit, boy. From the red hills yonder 'to the&#xD;
river, and from the road clean away up to Monroe's Notch, it&#xD;
is mine; secured by good warrantee ae&amp;amp;ds upon record. Ay,&#xD;
you may well stare," he continued, seeing Isaac's vacant look;&#xD;
"it's not many men that can show a farm like that,' worth&#xD;
good five thousand dollars to-day, to say nothing of the mill,&#xD;
which brings in, on an average, two hundred a year more. It&#xD;
took a long head to get all this property, Isaac; it will take.&#xD;
quite as long a one to keep it. I have spent e'en-a-inost ~&#xD;
thousand dollars - e'en-a-most a thousand-to teach you how&#xD;
to keep it, and to add now and then a penny to it; for&#xD;
who knows how much snore I might have got, if I had only&#xD;
known enough about the points of the law? You do know&#xD;
enough, and it shall be yours; only, mark me, boy, I must&#xD;
have no more nonsense about priests; you n~ust be a lawyer,&#xD;
- a rich lawyer, Isaac, and nothing else."&#xD;
"I know how much you have done for me, father. Believe&#xD;

sion in which I know I shall never succeed. I don't care for&#xD;
money, only let me follow the way which' my conscience'&#xD;
and"..-&#xD;
"Don't care for money!" screamed the old miller, aghast.&#xD;
"At~y~owmad, or a fool, or both? How often have I told&#xD;
you that a man could succeed in anything, if he only had&#xD;
money enough?"&#xD;
"Father! father!" exclaimed the young man, much agi-&#xD;
tated, "would that I could persuade you that there is some-&#xD;
thing better, higher, worthier of a life's devotion, than money.&#xD;
It is God's love - his peace. Has not Christ himself said,&#xD;
'What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world,&#xD;
and lose his own soul ?"'&#xD;
'.' Don't talk to me about souls!" angrily exclaimed the&#xD;
father. "These I see and know," he continued, pointing over&#xD;
tha ~rich fields he called his own; "and these," he added,&#xD;
striking his hand upon his breast, where lay the swollen pocket-&#xD;
book; "bt~t of souls you nor I know nothing. And now," he&#xD;
went on, seeing Isaac about to speak, "I can't stand parley-&#xD;
ing here. Once for all, are you going to obey me? Mill&#xD;
you be a'lawyer, or not?"&#xD;
The 'young man moved back and forth hurriedly for a few&#xD;
moments, then, with one glance at the lovely landscape and&#xD;
the blue heavens, he fronted his father, and said, sadly, but&#xD;
firmly:&#xD;
"Had you left it to me, father,, or even consulted me, I&#xD;
should uever have chosen the profession of law. Not that it&#xD;
is not honorable and great - even sublime in its principles&#xD;
and aims; but our views of it are widely different. Were I&#xD;
to follow it, you would be sadly disappointed, for never would&#xD;
I consent to advocate a cause Ii knew to be wrong; never&#xD;
Would I stoop to become the instrument of oppression and&#xD;
injustice. When I think how some of these very lands have&#xD;
been won, I cannot, dare not, obey you."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Damnation!" exclaimed the father, trembling with dis-&#xD;
appointment and anger. "Then not a cent shall you have of&#xD;
mine, to save you from the poor-house. Go, and my curse go&#xD;
with you!" he added, as he sprang hastily down the hill-side.&#xD;
Isaac sank down upon a shelving rock, and, covering his&#xD;
eyes with his hands, as if that beautiful scene had st~d4PiAy&#xD;
become painful to him, strove to collect his troubled th.ouglits.&#xD;
It was a fearful moment. All his past life, all his future&#xD;
hopes, seemed pressed into it, and he could only bow his head,&#xD;
and, in the anguish of his spirit, cry, "Our Jather!" As if&#xD;
in answer to that prayer, a calmer mood came to bless him.&#xD;
He carefully scrutinized all the circumstances of his short&#xD;
life, and the motives that had led him to renounce a course&#xD;
which he felt could only be to him a death-in-liTh. Then came&#xD;
the memory of his old nurse's legends of the ~arly martyrs,&#xD;
and his imagination kindled. "He that loveth father or&#xD;
mother more than me, is not worthy of me," he murmiged, ~s&#xD;
he arose and slowly took the way toward the old farmhouse&#xD;
in the Hollow. Just as he entered a thicket of young birch,&#xD;
at the foot of the hill, he met a boy with a fishing-rod over&#xD;
his shoulder, who placed, in his hands~ a letter, saying, old&#xD;
Captain Ward had given him some pennies to carry it to the&#xD;
mill. Isaac knew the old man's habits; something unusual&#xD;
must have occurred to rouse him to the effort of writing a let~&#xD;
ter, and, with a foreboding of sorrow, he broke the seal. It&#xD;
needed little skill to decipher those round, regular characters.&#xD;
There they stood, plain as the green earth beneath him, say~&#xD;
ing, in kind but firm words, that he must visit the Hollow no&#xD;
more.&#xD;
"Cursed by him, and through him!" murmured, the young&#xD;
man, as, in the utter loneliness of his heart, he sank upon the&#xD;
half-decayed trunk of a fallen t~ee. No one knows, no. one&#xD;
ever can~ know,: the sorrow, doubt, agony and despair, of&#xD;
the succeeding hours of that glorious mid-summer day.&#xD;

~ One, two, three, four, five, six weeks they occupy but a&#xD;
little 4ace oii our paper, yet they crawled over the Hollow&#xD;
like so many weary years. They brought sorrow and grief to&#xD;
the simple, affectionate hearts there, and, were we writing a&#xD;
mere love-story, we might tell how the heart of Mercy sank&#xD;
beneath The first taste 6f life's bitter chalice.&#xD;
Six weeks! and how passed they .at the mill? We 6nly~&#xD;
know that the great mill-wheel dashed round and round as of&#xD;
yore~ the waters moaned and sobbed, while Miller Jed con-&#xD;
tinued to scrape up the soft meal with his bent fingers, as he&#xD;
9ccasionally said to himself, "An obstinate dog; but he '11&#xD;
come round yet. Poverty is a rare tamer."&#xD;
Then, a man on horseback paused in the whitened atx~s-&#xD;
phere at the mill door, and delivered him a letter.&#xD;
"I was going on to M-.--, and promised onr minister that&#xD;
I would come this way and deliver that letter,'~ he said. "It 's&#xD;
sorry news, I reckon, an' you be his father;" and, with a&#xD;
whistle to his horse, he cantered across the bridge and up the&#xD;
hill.&#xD;
Miller Jed started4 at his wards, a~d stood for some time&#xD;
turning the letter over and over, as if he already appre-&#xD;
hetided its contents. Then, suddenly breaking the seal, he&#xD;
took them in at a glance.&#xD;
~ Fever come to him~- die 'death," he murmured, as&#xD;
~ in his trembling han~'ds. "lie shall not die!"&#xD;

&#xD;
He hurried to his horse, and, with the meal still powdering&#xD;
his gray locks, like the ashes of repentance, mounted his sleek&#xD;
mare, and took the road towards L-.---.&#xD;
Weary, faint, and almost despairing, Isaac Sewall had&#xD;
reached IL-, he hardly knew how, and, presentingi4rnself&#xD;
before Judge G~-.- and the old minister, stated 4I1~ 'his&#xD;
troubles, and besought their advice. "I am honele~s~- an&#xD;
outcast; but I had rather die than become the mean, petti.~&#xD;
fogging character for which my father designs me," he said,&#xD;
sadly.&#xD;
The old men were much impressed by his earnestness, and&#xD;
through their influence he was soon engaged as assistant in a&#xD;
large school in that vicinity; but he had hardly entered upon&#xD;
his new duties before he was seized with a raging fever.&#xD;
When Miller Jed reached L-~, the disease was near its&#xD;
crisis. All that night the miserable old man sat crouched in&#xD;
a dark corner of the room, scarcely daring to look upQ~ ~he~&#xD;
faee:of his child, listening to his ravings and low moans~ with&#xD;
feelings too fearful for us to describe. Sometimes h&amp;amp; was&#xD;
with his fellow-students, but oftener at the Hollow with Mercy;&#xD;
and, as if a gleam of the truth still reached his troubled&#xD;
brain, he would moan piteously, "0, take me home! ~Let&#xD;
me see her once more!"&#xD;
It was never of his own home, but of the Hollow, that he&#xD;
spoke, and only once his fbvered lips murmured the werd&#xD;
"Father." The very tone was like a dagger to the old mii..~&#xD;
ler's heart. The) next day the crisis was pa~t, and the&#xD;
sicians spoke of hope, though the old man scarcely e~rniiie~&#xD;
ended their words, but, through the live-long da~y s~t Wz~t~&#xD;

to gain strength, one yearning desire took possession of his&#xD;
mind. "Only let me go home, and I shall be well," he&#xD;
pleaded, day after day, until the kind-hearted physician&#xD;
yielded a reluctant consent. An easy carriage was procured,&#xD;
and, bolstered up with beds and pillows, Isaac bade farewell&#xD;
to his friends, and, at a. snail~iike pace, set out for home.&#xD;
j' I much doubt the wisdom of this step," said the old min~&#xD;
ister as the carriage disappeared round the corner. "It is&#xD;
sixteen miles to B-, and the poor child is very weak."&#xD;
"So do I," replied the physician, with a sigh, "yet it can&#xD;
make but a few weeks~ difference, at the worst." Then seeing&#xD;
the minister's inquiring look, he added, pointing to a golden&#xD;
leaf that floated slowly toward the ground, "our young&#xD;
friend's fate is like that, No earthly skill can change it."&#xD;
When the carriage reached the point where the green lane&#xD;
turned off to the IrIollow, Isaac raised his eyes imploringly to&#xD;
his father's face, and made a faint gesture, as if he would go&#xD;
that Way. Implicitly the old man obeyed, and, at. a slow&#xD;
funereal-pace, they drove on to the old farm-house. The sight&#xD;
of the carriage brought the whole household to the door.&#xD;
"He wcrtdd come," said the old miller, as if in apology, as&#xD;
they gathered round the carriage.&#xD;
"Yes, grandfather, mother, Mercy," said Isaac, faintly, as&#xD;
he stretched out towards them his thin hands, "I would&#xD;
come. You. first taught me how to live you mus1~ now&#xD;
teach we how to diet Forgive me, father," ~he added, laying&#xD;
his hand in the old millers, "they can pare for me better here&#xD;
th~ni at home, and yoa will come to sc~ inc daily."&#xD;
The old miller looked anxiously toward Adam. Ward. "If,"&#xD;
he murrmzred, hesitatingly, "money, can;repay you, take all I&#xD;
have, oR4y kt him stay only save bite."&#xD;
"Gladly will ~we~take him for his own sake," replied old&#xD;

trodden ~Jiem, had deepened into reality; end slowly, as the&#xD;
leaves change from green to crimson, and, impelled by their&#xD;
own weight, floated toward earth, so waned the life of young&#xD;
Isaac Sewall toward the grave. Loving hands tended him,&#xD;
and loving hearts lavished their wealth IQf tenderness ~ipon&#xD;
him, and he was serene and happy. He knew it was much&#xD;
letter to die thus than to go through life cold, selfish and&#xD;
unloving. And -he was happy in another thought; for all&#xD;
those sunny, autumn days his old father sat by his sidesome-&#xD;
times sobbing like a very child as he spake of death and&#xD;
heaven, listening humbly and earnestly to the sacred Word as&#xD;
it fell from the lips of Mer9y, - words which he had heard a&#xD;
thousand times, but never felt before, - and joining with un-&#xD;
feigned humility in the petitions which Adam Ward raised&#xD;
daily to the Father of all. Yes, Isaac was happy. ~Qnly&#xD;
when his eye rested on the tear-dimmed face of Mercy, ~au4~&#xD;
his ear caught the sobs which she could not wholly repress,&#xD;
was his heart troubled. Then he would take her hand, and,&#xD;
drawing her cheek down to his, murmur~;&#xD;
"Yes, it was a sweet dream,, beloved; but a little while,&#xD;
only a little while at the longest, and we shall mee%~gain;"&#xD;
In the mellow light of an October day they laid him in the&#xD;
village grave-yard, with very sorrowful but calm feelings.&#xD;
The perfect quiet of his last moments seemed to have de-&#xD;
scended on theni, especially upon the old miller. Henceforth,&#xD;
to him; death had put off his terrors. The thought of his&#xD;
~hild seemed ever before him in the way of eternal ~&#xD;
With an eager hand he strove to repair the 'sorrow which his&#xD;
gra8ping selfishness had caused, and most gladly would he&#xD;
have deeded back to Adam Ward his ancient in~ritance;&#xD;
but. the independ~it spirit of the old soldier would'ner~ait&#xD;
this. He declined, saying:&#xD;

Therefore, though no deeds witnessed the transfer of the&#xD;

in many an open and secret channel around their lives;&#xD;
channels opened by death. And, for many years afterward,&#xD;
two old men might often be seen, seated like brothers near&#xD;

II am sure I do not see why it need be so."&#xD;
"Look here, Kate," I returned, pausing, and placing my&#xD;
hand on the bole of one of the young shade-trees that 'lined&#xD;
the walk. "Is not this bark very smootbi and fresh?"&#xD;
"Why, yes, it feels like silk, whi1eit~t above and below is&#xD;

I cannot help thinking that she has been sad, very sad, some&#xD;
time in her life."&#xD;

fancying romances, when I see nothing but very plain matter-&#xD;
of-fact people, who eat and drink, go to bed and get u~, after&#xD;
the same old humdrum fashion. Not that I would apply that&#xD;

"0, no! I don't mean that she is gloomy," interrupted&#xD;
Ellen. "Indeed, it is difficult to express what I do mean,"&#xD;

she had been idly floating in the water, over our heads, and,&#xD;

couples, followed by a whole troop of relatives and friends, of&#xD;
all ages. The maiden's face wa~ hidden by a veil; but, as&#xD;
she turned it aside to take one more look at the home of her&#xD;
childhood and the dear faces clustered round her, one could&#xD;
see that it was beautiful - fresh and' beautiful as that bright&#xD;
May morning, 'andas dawy with tears - tears which again&#xD;
flowed rapidly, in spite of her efforts to suppress them, as,&#xD;
with her hand clasped close in that of her companion, she&#xD;
bowed her head to receive the parting blessing of their&#xD;
~w~nts, and the last good-by of those 'who had been her friends&#xD;
fr~in childhood.&#xD;
" Then) her brother's stout arm encircled her, and, with&#xD;
one kiss on her cheek, he placed her in her saddle. Her com~&#xD;
pinion sprang lightly into his, and, at a quick pace, without&#xD;
trusting themselves to look back, they 'crossed the same brawl-&#xD;
ing brook, and took the road yonder, where it winds towards&#xD;
the west.&#xD;
"The group remained in the yard, watching them until&#xD;
they saw them turn on the brow of the hill there, and v~rave&#xD;
a last farewell; then, the elder guests gathered round the&#xD;
parents, to speak a few words of cheer ere they departed for&#xD;
their homes. The younger ones grouped around theold porch,&#xD;
and discussed the wedding which took place the evening before;&#xD;
and the children ran in and out, with huge pieces of. cake in&#xD;
their hands, supplied from the liberal store of black Time, the&#xD;
head female slave.&#xD;
"It was agreed among the elder guests that James Sher-&#xD;
~nan~j~as an intelligent, steady, industrious fellow, who ~a's&#xD;
sure of making his way in the world anywhere, especi~dIy in&#xD;
that 'we~tera world. for which he had just started wi4h his&#xD;
young hrid&amp;amp;~ and many were the flattering pro~heeies 'tittered&#xD;
witWrcgard to his future success and position in that un~tl~d&#xD;
section, to all of which the bride's mother lent a&#xD;
while 1i~r heart murmured, 'Poor Mary!' The you~g~~s&#xD;
were ~zot 'the less unanimous i~ deciding that it was a capital&#xD;
&#xD;
match - that they were the finest-looking couple. they had&#xD;
seen for many a day that the bride's dress was beautiful -&#xD;
that her gray-coating riding-dress and round beaver hat were&#xD;
very, becoming and 'just the thing' for her journey; but,&#xD;
after all, it was a kind of wonder to. them how Mary Burgiss&#xD;
could ever consent to go .' clear away olX' to the ~Whitestown&#xD;
country' (as they called the settlement of old Judge White,&#xD;
in central New York), to live among bears) ~nd wolves, and&#xD;
those horrible Indians; and, as he listened to their Words,&#xD;
and recalled some of the fearful tales of frontier life which lie&#xD;
had heard, a dampness gathered upon the stout brother's eye-&#xD;
lashes, and he, tob; murmured, 'Poor Mary!'&#xD;
"Then the gnest~ mounted their horses, and turned chatting&#xD;
to their homes; and an hour later all was as quiet as usual'&#xD;
in and around yon old farm-house."&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
"In an open glade, formed partly by nature and partly by&#xD;
the woodman's axe, in the heart of the solemn old forest'&#xD;
that, little more than a half-century a~go, covered the rich&#xD;
swells and luxuriant vales of what is now Herkimer county,&#xD;
New York, stood a comfortable-looking log-house.&#xD;
"All around, for miles and miles awny, stretched that bil-&#xD;
lowy sea of forest-leaves, and, save by a narrow ~foot-path&#xD;
that led from the cabin-door across the clearing, and~was lost&#xD;
in the forest on the side towards the nearest settlement, the&#xD;
dwe1jl~rs in that solitary place seemed to be entirely shiiiK~;&#xD;

dow and over the low door-way, the gay, flowering bean and&#xD;
the home4ike morning-glory mingled their scarlet and purple&#xD;
blossoms.; and in the carefully-weeded bed, beneath the&#xD;
eaves, were ~a tribe~ of hollyhocks, marigolds, four-o'clocks,&#xD;
bachelor's-buttons (you know I like the pld-fashioned names,&#xD;
girls), pansies and pinks, mitigled with rue, hyssop, worm-&#xD;
wood, sage and fennel - every leaf, every blossom of which&#xD;
was as dear as the face of a friend to the heart of her who&#xD;
tended~ them, because so full of sweet memories of that home&#xD;
where the seed from which they sprung had been ripened and&#xD;
gathered, far away amid the rock-bound~ v~les of Connecti..&#xD;
cut. Such had been the aspect of the place through the long&#xD;
summer hours; but, at the time of which we wish to speak,&#xD;
the frosty breath of autumn had withered this wealth of&#xD;
greenery, and the long, brown trailers of the bean and morn-&#xD;
ing-glory swung mournfully in the breeze.&#xD;
"The glorious days of the Indian summer, during which&#xD;
the mighty forest had been as a sea of flame, almost too daz-&#xD;
sling to behold, were already gone, and the cold, raw, whis-&#xD;
tling winds of November began to moan and whine around&#xD;
that lonely cabin.&#xD;
"It was at the close of one of these leaden-hued days that&#xD;
a woman appeared in the door-way of the cottage, and gazed&#xD;
anxiously down the footpath where it disappeared in the for-&#xD;
est. As a gust of wind lifted aside the checked apron which&#xD;
she, had carelessly thrown over her head, it was easy to recog-&#xD;
nize the fine features of Niary Sherman. Her cheek was a&#xD;
shade or two browner, perhaps, than when she crossed yon&#xD;
old t~reshel&amp;amp; a brid~ but her slender, girlish flgur~ had&#xD;
ripen~h. into the luxuriant development of womanhood, and&#xD;
there.was an abiding light in Iier dark eyes, so serene~ deep&#xD;
and tender, that one feW at once that some new revelatkaL of&#xD;
life's mysteries had been vouchsafed toller.&#xD;
." More than once she appeared in the do*, lo4kin~&#xD;
&#xD;
anxiously into the dense forest, and at each time her brow&#xD;
wore a deeper shade Qf anxiety.&#xD;
"Suddenly her practiced eye caught sight of a well~knowx~&#xD;
form hurrying along the narrow path, and, with a flush of'&#xD;
joy on her cheek, and words of thanksgiving upon her lip~&#xD;
she sprang forward to meet her lni~band.&#xD;
"'You have been frightened, Mary,' he said, in reply to&#xD;
her exclamation of delight, a,~ he threw his ann ovei~ her&#xD;
shoulders, and gazed fondly down upon her upturned face.&#xD;
"'No; at least not for myself, James, but for your'. she&#xD;
replied. 'You arp. later than usual - later than you prom-.&#xD;
ised, and you kn6w there have been rumors of a party of hos-&#xD;
tile Indians being seen in the neiglibQrhood.'&#xD;
"'But they were twenty miles off, if, indeed, any were&#xD;
seen, which I much doubt. Ned Emmons is always seeing&#xD;
Indians behind every bush and stump. Ypu would make a&#xD;
capital frontier-man's wife, Mary, if you could only forget&#xD;
other folks as readily as you do yourself. And now,' he con-&#xD;
tinued, pausing and laying his hand upon her arm, as she was&#xD;
about to raise the wooden latch to their door, 'Whom do y~u&#xD;
think I haveseen?'&#xD;
"She looked up into his animated face for a moment, and,&#xD;
her own glowing with sudden hope, exclaimed;&#xD;
"'Some one from home, is it not? Brother John ha~&#xD;
come!'&#xD;
"'No;' and the glowing light began to pale as her hus-&#xD;
band went on. 'You will have to guess again, Mary; but I&#xD;
will not tease you. It is George Allen; and here, see what&#xD;
he ~as brought,' he ~added, as he drew fr9xn the deep ~&#xD;
of his l~iznting-jacket a great, square letter, direetad. in the&#xD;
large, ~und characters which ~she recognized at once as ~ke~&#xD;
fatlwi9s hand,&#xD;
"'A letter! Ohow glad I am!' she exclaimed. 'AI4&#xD;

Whei~ is he? Why did he not coma hrnie with you?'&#xD;

"'He only arrived' this noon, and his cousins would not&#xD;
hear of his coming with me to-night,' replied the husband, as&#xD;
he-9pened the door and .~et the butt of his rifle rather heavily&#xD;
upon the floor.&#xD;
"'Hush!' said Mary, softly, springing across the room,&#xD;
and laying her hand ona~ ~clumsy cradle, evidently the work&#xD;
of James' jackknife and saw, while she began to murmur&#xD;
over the nestling occupant some old New England strain.&#xD;
James~ Sherman moved stealthily to her side; and when, after&#xD;
a few moments, the eyes of the young parents met, as they&#xD;
lifted them from the face of their first-born ~hild, it was very&#xD;
evident under what form that new revelation of life's mys-&#xD;
teries had been given them.&#xD;
"As the twilight deepened into night, the wild winds woke&#xD;
in the forest and swept in fitful gusts across the clearing,&#xD;
driving before them occasional showers of sleet and rain, rat-&#xD;
tling against the cabin walls, and shaking the wooden fasten-&#xD;
'ings with a violence that threatened their security. But&#xD;
James Sherman, ~0nfident in the strength of the good sea-&#xD;
~oned oak, only smilecPas he saw his wife start at the clamor&#xD;
of the baffled winds, and drew his chair nearer to her side,&#xD;
while he continued to speak of the contents of the welcome&#xD;
letter, which they had. read over and over again, and of his&#xD;
meeting with their old friend; until Mary almost forgot to&#xD;
rock the cradle at her side in the interest which the subject&#xD;
awakened.&#xD;
"'How good it does seem to get a letter from home!' she&#xD;
said. 'It is almost like seeing them every one. So Grand-&#xD;
mother Fowler is gone at last the kind, old souL She&#xD;
spun this very yarn that I am knitting; and I remember, ~as&#xD;
well as it' it had happened to-day, what she said when ~he&#xD;
gave it to me. " There, child," she said, "I have spun a&#xD;
double portion for you, for you won't have any old grand-&#xD;
nwther to spin for you out in the woods there; and mayhap&#xD;
she may notj* ~iere when you oom~e back."'&#xD;
&#xD;
"After a moment's silence to the memory of' her kind old&#xD;
relative, she went on:&#xD;
"'And Fred. Hoadley and Lucy Stone are married. Well,&#xD;
I should think it was time they were, if they ever intended&#xD;
to be. Why, he had waited on het a year or two before we&#xD;
came away. And to think that Hannah Meigs has got a.&#xD;
baby! That beats all. Why, they have been ~married as&#xD;
much as ten years! But when is George coming here, James,&#xD;
and how long ~ll he stay~'&#xD;
"So the happy young' wife ran on, and her husband&#xD;
replied:&#xD;
"'He will come here in the morning. Jim Lee is coiiiing&#xD;
over with him, and he will stay around here about a week.&#xD;
He stopped two weeks at his sister's, on the way, and he says&#xD;
he must certainly reach home by Thanksgiving.'&#xD;
"'And, if he does, our folks will get a letter from us just&#xD;
at the right time. They will all be at home Thankful, and&#xD;
Sarah, and Eunice, and Eben, with their f~x~lies. They will ~'&#xD;
all be there, James - all but lI~;' and the tears spran~ t&amp;amp;&#xD;
her eyes, as she thought of the pleasant old festival, and the&#xD;
family gathering beneath her father's roof.&#xD;
"Her husband drew her head to his shoulder, and, gazing&#xD;
thoughtfully into her eyes a moment, said:&#xD;
"'You were ever a home-bird, Mary, and I have some-&#xD;
times thought, when I am all alone in the woods, that I did&#xD;
very wrong in bringing you so fa~ away, to' this lonely&#xD;
place.'&#xD;
"'No, no, James; how coul4~y~i ever think so? I have&#xD;
been so happy here!' she added; ~Wiehig at the fair, round&#xD;
fao~ in the cradle. 'I only tJiou~ht, at that moment, how&#xD;
pleasant it would be to see them all once more for you, and&#xD;
I, and baby, to ~tep in upon them. 'Would nt they stare? '-&#xD;
she went on, smiling at the picture her words brought up;&#xD;

are going to call her Clara, after her. You are sure George&#xD;
will come in the morning, James?'&#xD;
"With her babe on her arm, and a smile on her lip, at the&#xD;
thought of meeting her old friend, Mary Sherman sought her&#xD;
bed, to dream, perchance, of yon pleasant' old homestead.'&#xD;
"Some two hours later she was awakened by a yell that&#xD;
struck the terror of death to her heart. It was the terrific&#xD;
war-whoop of the savages. Her husband sprang to his feet,&#xD;
and, seizing his rifle, made for the door. The heavy wooden&#xD;
bars still resisted the pressure from without; but at that in-&#xD;
stant the blows of half a dozen hatchets fell upon the thick&#xD;
plank.&#xD;
"'The chest - quick help me, Mary!' he whispered;&#xD;
and, following his motions rather than his words, the terrified&#xD;
woman united her strength to his, which seemed at that in-&#xD;
stant almost 'superhuman, and they succeeded in moving the&#xD;
heavy wooden piece of furniture, which contained all their&#xD;
household valuables, against the door.&#xD;
"Going to the back part of the house, where there was a&#xD;
narrow door, seldom used, and then completely hidden by the&#xD;
clinging ~osos, the husband bent his ear for a moment, and&#xD;
listened breathlessly.&#xD;
"'The devils are all in front, Mary,' he whispered, going&#xD;
to the bed and pressing one kiss upon the soft cheek of his&#xD;
child, as he placed it in her arms. 'Fly, dearest; this is&#xD;
your only hope! Quick~ !'~ I will follow as soon as I have&#xD;
placed a few more things ag~dnst the door. It may help to&#xD;
deceive them. For God's &amp;amp;~ke, fly!' he repeated in agony,&#xD;
as he unclasped her arm from his neck. 'Take the path to&#xD;
the big oak in the east woods. I will be with you in a n~o-&#xD;
ment! 0, God ! he murmured, as she disappeared in the&#xD;
darkness; and the strong man, reeled ~as' he turned to his&#xD;
barricade.&#xD;
'Drawing her scanty night clothing around ~her babe, to,&#xD;
shield it from tJi~ bitter winds, Mary She~iuau fled, like ~&#xD;
&#xD;
leaf' before the gale, in the direction which her husband had&#xD;
indicated. In the edge of the wood stood the giant oak,&#xD;
and, crouching behind its great trunk, she awaited, iW~an&#xD;
agony that no words can describe, the coming of her hus-&#xD;
band. Unmindful of the cold, sleety 7~ain, that drenched her&#xD;
thin garments, but pressing her babe more closely to hez~&#xD;
breast, she kept her eyes strained in the direction of h~r&#xD;
home, as if she would pierce the thick darkness that lay be-&#xD;
tween them. Suddenly a ferocious yell rent the air, and the&#xD;
tall spiral flames shot up from the thatched roof of her&#xD;
home, casting a red glare over the clearing, and bringing&#xD;
into clear relief the dusky forms of the yelling savages.&#xD;
With a groan of agony, the wretched wife sank down at the&#xD;
foot of the friendly tree.&#xD;
"From this state of happy insensibility she was at length&#xD;
roused by the failings of her child. The poor little thing&#xD;
was almost dead from cold. Instinctively, she crept along a&#xD;
few yards, to where lay a great hollow log, which she had&#xD;
often noted in happier days. Creeping into this shelter, with&#xD;
her baby in her arms, she awaited, in fear ~nd agony, t~1ie~&#xD;
coming dawn.&#xD;
"She almost shrieked in return, as she heard the yells of&#xD;
the departing Indians, as they plunged into the woods, and&#xD;
once she raised her child to flee, as a low growl from the&#xD;
other end of her strange shelter fell on her ear. ~-Qut fear&#xD;
of the foe without gave her courage, to remain and face that&#xD;
within, if need be; and when the gray light of dawn stoip&#xD;
into her shelter, and she saw a monstrous bear rise from his&#xD;
bed in the opposite end of the log, and stalk slowly toward&#xD;
the forest, without evea glancing at her, she drew her child&#xD;
closer to her breast, and thanked God that the brute had&#xD;
been more pitiful than man.&#xD;
"When George Allen and his guide from the settlement&#xD;
reached the, clearing of his old friends,, the next morning,&#xD;

ashes, and about a rod from that narrow back door lay the&#xD;
happy group of the evening before - the scalped and lifeless&#xD;
body of James Sherman, his insensible wife, and the little&#xD;
child moaning by their side."&#xD;
"Did n't she die on the spot, Miss R----?" exclaimed&#xD;
Kate Lee. "Surely no woman could survive a night like&#xD;
that!"&#xD;
"No, Katie; as is our day, so is our strength. Mary&#xD;
Sherman lived - lived to bring up her fatherless child -&#xD;
lives now to bless with her counsel her children in the third&#xD;
generation; and your young eyes have failed to perceive any&#xD;
traces of this 'baptism of pain."'&#xD;
"Our eyes, Miss R-.? Have we seen her?" both my&#xD;
young friends exclaimed at once.&#xD;
"You have looked upon her face today, dear girls; for&#xD;
Mary Sherman is now Grandmother S-.."&#xD;

THE ALM8IJOUSE BOY.&#xD;
"THERE - take that and that - and that!" and Mrs.&#xD;
Rhoda Tallman brought her hard hand against the ears of an&#xD;
eight-years-old urchin, with a force and dexterity that would&#xD;
have excited the admiration of any professed pugilist in&#xD;
Christendom.&#xD;
The child was, evidently, used to it; he did not shrink or&#xD;
dodge, but stood and took the blows with an air of stubborn&#xD;
indifference. Retreating a step or two, she eyed him from&#xD;
head to foot, a moment, and again went on:&#xD;
"Now, look at them 'ere trousers - all i mastered over&#xD;
with mud! You 'ye been through every mud-puddle between&#xD;
here and the school-house! Shut up - not a word out of&#xD;
your mouth!" she continued, seeing him about to speak.'&#xD;
"Who do you think is goin' to pay me for rubbing the skin&#xD;
off my hands every week, to keep you decent - to say&#xD;
nothing of wood and soap? Not the selectmen, I car~tell&#xD;
you! It 's little enough they are willing' to pay." Tiieii, ~s&#xD;
if, to use one of her own expressions, "she did n't know ~hovr&#xD;
to keep her hands off from him," she strode forward, caught&#xD;
him by the colh~r of a poor, faded, forlorn-looking cotton&#xD;
jacket, and shook him, very much as we have seen a snarling&#xD;
cur shake a kitten that had presumed to ctoss hi~ path.&#xD;

out the beet beds; and let me catch you picking green cur-&#xD;
rants, or getting down on your knees in the dirt, if you dare!"&#xD;
The boy walked slowly away until he reached a corner of&#xD;
the building, when he paused, and pouted out his lips, and&#xD;
shook his clenched fists, in a way that indicated anything but&#xD;
submission and respect. It was well she did not turn back,&#xD;
~s usual, to see that her orders were obeyed, but hastened in-&#xD;
to the house to join a gossip, whom she had very impolitely&#xD;
left alone while she performed this little scene.&#xD;
After taking breath, and assuring her visitor that she&#xD;
might "thank her stars that she had n't any of the town&#xD;
poor to deal with, for a more provoking, shiftless, idle, lying&#xD;
set of folks never breathed the breath of life," she took up&#xD;
hei' work, arid with it the topic of conversation which had&#xD;
been so suddenly interrupted by the vision of little Ned Nor-&#xD;
ris' mud-bespattered trousers.&#xD;
"As to the family in the other part of the house, as I said&#xD;
before, Mrs. Gadman, I know precious little about them, but&#xD;
that 's quite enough. I wish they had kept where they&#xD;
belonged."&#xD;
"Why, Mrs. Rhoda, I thought you would be pleased to&#xD;
have some one in the house with you. That part always&#xD;
looks so dark and pokerish that I 'in almost afraid to pass it&#xD;
after dark."&#xD;
Mrs. Gadman spoke mischievously, for she well knew that&#xD;
Mrs. Rhoda did not, ~ts she often said, "fear the face of&#xD;
clay," besides, she knew, also, that her vixenish temper was&#xD;
the chief reason why the half of. the house, belonging to a&#xD;
brother, remained unoccupied; those who had tried living&#xD;
there declaring that people might as well try to live in a&#xD;
hornet's nest as with such a woman.&#xD;
"Yes, IL dare say. There are some folks in the world who&#xD;
are callers afeard of their own shadow can't be contented&#xD;
without. they are surroundedd a whole tribe of people U'&#xD;
said the old dame, sharply, "IJ~ut I like their room bett~&#xD;
&#xD;
than their company. Thank the Lord, I a'n't nervous, and&#xD;
as to ghosts, I 'd rather deal with ~all that ever walked than&#xD;
this woman's young ones. Look at that great grease-spot,"&#xD;
she went on, pointing to a stain on her well-scoured floor.&#xD;
"They are all the time cantering throug~i the ~pace~ and yes-&#xD;
terday one of 'em took it into his head to come in here with&#xD;
a great slice of bread-and-butter in his hand, and drop it on&#xD;
my floor. Now, I may scour and scrub a month to get it&#xD;
out. But I 'itt not going to put up with their, running in&#xD;
and out here, and so I told her, pretty plainly."&#xD;
"What did she say?"&#xD;
"0, butter would n't have melted in her mouth! 'She&#xD;
was so sorry that sonny had made me any trouble; but he&#xD;
must he very careful, and promise good Mrs. Tailman not&#xD;
to do so again.' Faugh! I 'd a sonnied him if he 'd been&#xD;
my boy!"&#xD;
"I dare say. But how does ~this woman live? They say&#xD;
she is very poor. Mrs. White says she never saw such a&#xD;
mean load of goods as they brought. Yet she looks respect-&#xD;
able enough. I met her the other slay, as I came out of&#xD;
Darling &amp;amp; Brown's."&#xD;
"Yes, and she feels respectable enough, too, I can assure&#xD;
you. But, with all her managing, anybody can see that they&#xD;
are as poor as Job. She has nothing but what she earns&#xD;
with her needle; but, Ia me! she 's as particular about what&#xD;
her young ones say and do as if she was the minister's wife.&#xD;
They must go to school every single day, to learn geography&#xD;
and gram mar, and such like. I wonder if she expects it&#xD;
will get 'em a meal of victuals? The oldest boy 'is larnin' a&#xD;
trade in New Haven, and I really believe that she and the&#xD;
children would starve through the week rather than not have&#xD;
something good when he comes home of ~a Sunday. Then&#xD;
she -makes such a fuss over him tells ~h~ixn all h0r plans,&#xD;
and asks his advice, jest as if the opinion of a~ 'prentice boy&#xD;
was of any conseqnenee! She may be a decent sort~of a&#xD;

&#xD;
woman enough for aught I know, but she hadn't the least fac-&#xD;
ulty to get along in the world or to- govern her children.&#xD;
There 'a nothing like makin' children know their places, neigh-&#xD;
bor Gadinan, and Widow Banks will find that out before&#xD;
many years, I guess. That oldest boy of hers rules the&#xD;
whole roost, now;, it fairly makes me ache to see how she&#xD;
lets 'em go on; for, let my boys be what they may now, as&#xD;
long as they were under my thumb, they had to walk pretty&#xD;
straight. I 'ye got one thing to comfort me - it can't be&#xD;
said I spoilt them by indulgence!"&#xD;
"Certainly not," said the guest, as she rose to leave, anx-&#xD;
ious to discuss Widow Banks' "ways and means" at the next&#xD;
house; and "certainly not," we repeat, Mrs. Rhoda, for&#xD;
when wert thou ever liable to th~ J" soft impeachment" of&#xD;
showing indulgence to aught beneath thy control?&#xD;
Rigidly just, according to thy poor, meagre conceptions&#xD;
of justice, we grant thee; but indulgent! - why, the sharp,&#xD;
fife-like tones of thy voice, the cold, steady gleam of thy light~&#xD;
blue eyes, thy sallow, diminutive, froze-and-thawed visage,&#xD;
would be sufficient vouchers of thy innocence, even if we we~e&#xD;
unable to ~oint to the example of thy two strong-limbed,&#xD;
stout-hearted boys, who embraced the earliest opportunity to&#xD;
slip from beneath thy maternal thumb, and, true to their&#xD;
early habits, have continued to "walk straight" away, with-&#xD;
out pausing to cast one regretful glance on the home of their&#xD;
childhood, or wishing, even in dreams, to see again their&#xD;
mother's face; but, violent, selfish and unprincipled, one now&#xD;
hunts the cunning beaver along our western waters, a savage&#xD;
among savages, while the other makes one of the crowd that&#xD;
fill our prisons, the victim of his own unbridled passions.&#xD;
Alas! for thee, Mrs. Rhoda Tallman! Alas! for all poor,&#xD;
stinted sc~uls, who have learned to recognize no higher law&#xD;
than mere physical force - who still cling to the old code of&#xD;
tex~ taticinis, as. tenaciously as if they had had their birth. en&#xD;
th~ plains of Syria, beneath the shadow of a Hebrew tent.&#xD;
&#xD;
But, in justice to the old woman, we must say that, if she&#xD;
had seen three-score years without catching one strain of the&#xD;
angelic chorus of peace and good-will which, for eighteen&#xD;
centuries, has been filling our atmosphere and the heart of&#xD;
every reverent listener with hopes mightier than death and the&#xD;
grave, it was, in part, owing to other causes than wilful ig-&#xD;
norance.&#xD;
Born amidst the squalid misery of the drunkard's home,&#xD;
where the very 'atmosphere was heavy with strife and curses;&#xD;
alike the victim of a drunken father's rage and th~ ungov-&#xD;
ernable temper of her miserable, fretful, sorely-tried mother,&#xD;
she had grown up to maturity, with some dozen more young&#xD;
immortals, ignorant, selfish, and ungovernable. As she had&#xD;
advanced towards womanhood, several influences came in to&#xD;
soften, or, rather, conceal the sharp, disagreeable points in&#xD;
her character. At eighteen, she married Jo Tallman, an&#xD;
easy, good-tempered, indolent fellow, who, after one or two&#xD;
futile attempts to enforce his authority on a disputed point,.&#xD;
found himself obliged to leave the field to his shrewish part-&#xD;
ner, and in a few weeks became as subi~iissive as a lamb.&#xD;
If cleanliness be next to godliness, as is asserted, then&#xD;
Mrs. fLhoda was certainly in a yery enviable condition; for&#xD;
she possessed this virtue to an extreme degree. Even in her&#xD;
own squalid home she had been noticeable for her habits of&#xD;
cleanliness and industry, and, when she had a home of her&#xD;
own, they soon came to comprise, in her view, all religion&#xD;
and ethics; indeed, we much doubt if she would have been&#xD;
contented in heaven unless there were some floors there to&#xD;
scrub or some stains to scratch out.&#xD;
Jo Tallman was a blacksmith by trade, and it cannot be&#xD;
denied that when he came~fr from the shop, his shoes left many&#xD;
unsightly traces on his wife's, nicely-scoured floors, especially&#xD;
in. damp, rainy weather, which *ere sure to call forth her&#xD;
sharpest words. This roused themalignant spirit of recrhnin-&#xD;
ation, which left foot~priuts in their~hearts far more unsightly&#xD;

&#xD;
and difficult of erasure than those on the floor. The wordy&#xD;
conflict was unequal. Jo had no great development of the&#xD;
organ of language; besides, lie was too easy to scold; so, by&#xD;
degrees, he found that he could enjoy himself far more to his&#xD;
mind in a corner of the Village bar-room, than at his own&#xD;
fireside, thus leaving his two little boys wholly to the control&#xD;
of his stronger half. During their early years, by dint of&#xD;
scolding, threatening, and whipping, the mother managed to&#xD;
keep these boys remarkably ignorant of the mysteries of mud&#xD;
pastry, measuring the depth of brooks, climbing trees and&#xD;
fences, and all that department of ,science to which the mind&#xD;
of childhood "doth seriously incline." As they grew in&#xD;
years and stature, she by no means relaxed the pressure of&#xD;
her thumb, but, by equivocation, deception; and open false-&#xD;
hood, they often cQntrived to slip from beneath it, until in..&#xD;
physical strength they became more than a match for her,&#xD;
and treated her commands with contempt and defiance. This&#xD;
state of things was not reached without many severe struggles&#xD;
on her part to retain her arbitrary control over them, and&#xD;
their home not infrequently echoed furious words ~f anger&#xD;
and strife. They soon followed their father's example, and took&#xD;
refuge in the tavern. In time, the evil influence of the place&#xD;
began to show itself in the habits of both father and sons,&#xD;
and the demon of intemperance ~was added to domestic strife.&#xD;
But the wife and mother was the last to see it. She sat&#xD;
alone by her nice hearth diligently plying the needle, and&#xD;
comforting herself with the reflection that there is "no loss&#xD;
without some gain;" if they were away, she need n't burn&#xD;
so much wood, neither would they be littering the room&#xD;
ii~i with whittling and other rubbish; the tavern was the*&#xD;
place for such things - a handfi4 qf dirt there, more or less,&#xD;
did not matter anyway.&#xD;
Such was Rhoda Tallman~ in her youth, hard, querulous,&#xD;
and exacting; and she was in no wise changed for the better&#xD;

when, husbandless and childless, she took little Ned Norris&#xD;
to live with her. Ned was' one of&#xD;
Love's outcasts on the earth;&#xD;
The child of love,- betraying and betrayed, -&#xD;
The blossom opened in the Upas' shade."&#xD;
So ran the rumor, for the mother, poor, young, friendless&#xD;
thing, refused to answer questions; and, a few hours after his&#xD;
birth, exchangecf the bitter charities~ of the village almshoiise&#xD;
for the grave.&#xD;
When the child was about four years old, the town mag-&#xD;
nates, in their wisdom, decided that it would be less expen..&#xD;
sive to board out the few paupers dependent on them, than&#xD;
to support an almshouse. Accordingly, at the annual town-&#xD;
meeting, they were put up at auction, like any other town&#xD;
property, but with this radical difference, they were~struck&#xD;
off to the lowest instead of the highest bidder. Thus it hap..&#xD;
pened that little Ned Norris, after going the rounds of some&#xD;
half-dozen families that necessity or the desire for gain had&#xD;
induced to "bid him off" at the lowest living price per week,&#xD;
became, at last, an inmate of 1~iJrs. Rhoda Tallman's dwelling.&#xD;
He was a bright, quick-witte~d, impulsive boy, and, young as&#xD;
he was, did not fail to see, or rather feel, that the aim of each&#xD;
family was to make the most out of their bargain; and, as&#xD;
they were usually coarse pe~iple, with whom cuffs were more&#xD;
ready / coin than caresses, the consequence was, that he be-*&#xD;
came indifferent to shame and punishment, careless, idle,&#xD;
and ~tubborn.&#xD;
But the angel of mercy never wholly abandons the heart&#xD;
of childhood, and sometimes &amp;amp; gift from a schoolmate (the&#xD;
selectmenn" always stipuliited with the people who l&amp;amp;~pt&#xD;
him, for so many weeks' schoQling, or, at least, a pretence&#xD;
towards it), or a kind word fro~ii~the teacher, would stir his&#xD;
better nature, and kept it from becoming entirely enoru~ted&#xD;
with evil.&#xD;

&#xD;
* Until the Widow Banks and her children came to reside in&#xD;
the house, Ned had never given much thought to his friend-&#xD;
less, isolated position. Sometimes, indeed, on the "last day"&#xD;
of school, when the picture-books were distributed, and his&#xD;
schoolmates ran shouting home to display them to their&#xD;
mothers and sisters, he had slackened his pace, and wondered&#xD;
why he had no relations - wishing very much that he had a&#xD;
sister, or, at least, a cousin, to whom ho could show his pic-&#xD;
tures.&#xD;
But when. George and Sarah Banks became his school-&#xD;
mates, and he listened to their ceaseless quotations of "main-&#xD;
ma," and references to "brother Fred.," this feeling became&#xD;
more distinct. Many times, as he bent over the garden beds&#xD;
after school, with his allotted task before him, his eyes would&#xD;
wander to the window where Mrs. Banks usually sat cease-&#xD;
lessly plying her needle on "band, gusset and seam," occasion-&#xD;
ally turning her head to reply to little Allan's "bo-peep," or&#xD;
listening with a pleasant smile to the bird-like chatter of&#xD;
George and Sarah. He could not help feeling the difference be-&#xD;
tween their home and his; and he wondered if Mrs. Banks&#xD;
never scolded nor got angry like Mrs. Rhoda, and how it would&#xD;
seem to have such a home. His fingers would forget their&#xD;
mole-like, task, and he would sit dreaming of these things&#xD;
until the sharp voice of~ his mistress roused all the old Adam&#xD;
in his nature, and be would pursue his work, muttering:&#xD;
~ If she wants weeds pulled ai~y faster, she may pull them&#xD;
herself."&#xD;
After turning to bestow on Mrs. Rhoda the grin of hate&#xD;
and defiance, on the occasion which we have described at&#xD;
the ~ommencement of the story, ho walked slowly into the&#xD;
garden, and began jerking up tl~&amp;amp;weeds, with a strong wish in&#xD;
his heart that he could jerk Mrs. Rhoda in just the same way-&#xD;
He di4 not once * look up to Mrs. Banks' window,' nor heed&#xD;
the voices of her children, whQ were speaking very eagerly.&#xD;
They were speaking of him, and, presently, Mrs. Banks laid&#xD;
&#xD;
two beds, before sundown."&#xD;
&#xD;
2&#xD;
&#xD;
down her work and c~nie out into the garden; but he was&#xD;
too angry - too intent on listening to the evil thoughts&#xD;
which filled him-~.to heed her step, until she laid her hand on&#xD;
his head, and said:&#xD;
"George tells me that you fell and hurt your ankle, while&#xD;
helping Sarah to escape from some unruly cattle, to-day."&#xD;
"I could n't help it!" began the boy, in a tone of depre-&#xD;
cation; for Mrs. Rhoda was no believer in accidents, and he&#xD;
mistook Mrs. Banks' tone for one of censure. "~I stepped on&#xD;
a stone, and it rolled."&#xD;
"Of course you could not; no boy falls when he can help&#xD;
'       it," she replied, rather amused at his manner. "I did not&#xD;
intend to blame you for falling, but to thank you for your care&#xD;
of Sarah, and to see how badly you are hurt. Which foot is&#xD;
it?" she asked, bending down to examine it.&#xD;
The child looked with a kind of bashful wonder into the&#xD;
widow's face, then down upon his little, bare, brown feet, and,&#xD;
hastily drawing back, he rinsed theni in a shallow pool of&#xD;
water left by the recent shower, and held up the ankle for&#xD;
come off, ma'am."&#xD;
her examination, saying, in a tone of hesitation: Now put it&#xD;
It is&#xD;
bear your weight upon. it. Where&#xD;
does it hurt w~orst?" she added, pressing her fingers lightly&#xD;
on the swollen place.&#xD;
The boy winced, and said: "Please don't - don't turn it&#xD;
that way, ma'am!"&#xD;
"It is a bad sprain, and will make you lame for some&#xD;
days, I fear. If you will go into the house, Twill bind it up&#xD;
fot you."&#xD;
The boy hesitated. "I am afraid Mr&amp;amp; Rhoda will thrash&#xD;
me, if I do."&#xD;
"Thrash you?" repeated the widow, in surprise.&#xD;
"Yes; whip me if I don't get all the weedspulled in these&#xD;

&#xD;
"Did you tell Mrs. Tallman you had hurt your ankle?"&#xD;
"But you should have told her when you first came home,&#xD;
and she would have bound it up nicely. Why did n't you&#xD;
tell her?" she asked rather curiously, as she marked his sud-&#xD;
den change of expression.&#xD;
"Because because," he stammered, while his lip trem-&#xD;
bled at the memory of the blows that had~ scarcely ceased to&#xD;
tingle; "because she would not let me; and if I had, she 'd&#xD;
only said, as she callers does, she was plagny glad of it - it&#xD;
would learn me to stand up, next time. I won't stay here!"&#xD;
he continued, more vehemently, "I '11 run away -I hate&#xD;
her - I wish she was dead!"&#xD;
"Hush! hush! my boy," said Mrs. Banks, gently. "This&#xD;
is all wrong. You don't know what you are saying. You&#xD;
don't wish any such thing."&#xD;
"Yes, I do, and I wish I was dead, too, for everybody&#xD;
thrashes me;" and the poor boy drew his ragged straw hat&#xD;
over his face, and burst into tears.&#xD;
This time there was quite as much sorrow as anger in his&#xD;
tones, and the motherly heart of Mrs. Banks was touched by&#xD;
his friendless condition.&#xD;
"Poor boy .- poor little fellow!" she said as she gathered&#xD;
one of his little hands in hers; "have you no friends - no&#xD;
one to look after you?"&#xD;
The boy shook his head and continued to sob.&#xD;
"You must not feel so badly, Edward," she added, after a&#xD;
moment's silence. "I will be your friend, and I will ask&#xD;
Mrs. Tallman to let you come and see us often. We will all&#xD;
love you vd~y much. Indeed, George and Sarah do already;&#xD;
Only think, if you had been dead to-day, who would have&#xD;
saved Sarah? You have no mother, they say,'~ - she felt&#xD;
the boy's hand tremble in hers, -" but if you try to be a&#xD;
good boy I will be your mother, and George and Sarah and&#xD;
&#xD;
little Allan shall be your brothers and sister. You will like&#xD;
that, I dare say~"&#xD;
"Yes, xna'am," whispered the subdued child, but with a look&#xD;
of wonder, as if he did not comprehend just how all this was&#xD;
to be brought about.&#xD;
"I will go iiow, and talk with Mrs. Tallman about your&#xD;
ankle, and, if she will permit, I will send George to help you&#xD;
with your weedino"&#xD;
Mrs. Rhoda ~had parted from Mrs. Gadman, and resumed&#xD;
her work when she saw Mrs. Banks approaching her door.&#xD;
"What can ~he be after here?" she muttered. "To bor-&#xD;
row something, I '11 warrant. I 'ye been expecting it ever&#xD;
since she came. But I 'm not goin' to begin any such thing,&#xD;
and so I '11 let her know in the first of it."&#xD;
This amiable determination made itself felt in her fingers,&#xD;
which twitched the needle through the coarse cloth she was&#xD;
sewing with a more decided jerk than usual, and her whole&#xD;
attitude said, as plainly as words can say, "I neither borrow&#xD;
nor lend."&#xD;
Mrs. Banks paused at the door, wiped her shoes with a&#xD;
degree of care which in any other mood would have won the&#xD;
old woman's admiration; but she did not look up until that&#xD;
lady said pleasantly, "Good-afternoon, Mrs. Taihuan. I&#xD;
saw you at the window, and was tempted to come in and chat&#xD;
with you a while; but your floor is so white I am almost&#xD;
afraid to step on it."&#xD;
This compliment acted as a slight solvent on the old wo-&#xD;
man'sAetermination, and she condescended to look up and say,&#xD;
"Come in, ma'am. You need n't be afraid of stepping on&#xD;
my floor, for it is dirty enough, IL am sure, though IC washed&#xD;
it up this morning. But there 's no use in a body's trying&#xD;
to keep decent in such weather, when it rains once in two&#xD;
hours, and with that good-for-nothing boy to run in and out,&#xD;
and make more tracks than a dog."&#xD;
"But we housekeepers must confess that, if the frecjuent&#xD;

showers do make bad work with our floors,' they make the&#xD;
scene without very beautiful. I have been looking at your&#xD;
garden; it really does me good to see how bright and thrifty&#xD;
everything looks4. I can almost see the plants grow."&#xD;
"And' the weeds too, I 'II warrant; for that boy is the la-&#xD;
ziest of all mortals."&#xD;
"Perhaps he would work better if lie had some one with&#xD;
him. I find that children soon get tired of working alone."&#xD;
Somebody with him! Do you suppose I 'm going out&#xD;
there to pull weeds, when I keep him for seventy-five cents a&#xD;
week, and don't make a cent at that, the Lord knows!" cried&#xD;
the old woman sharply.&#xD;
"Certainly not," said the Widow Banks, with a significance&#xD;
she tried in vain to repress; "but 'my George is constantly&#xD;
teasing me for something to do. When I could afford to have&#xD;
a garden he used to help me a great deal. He will be very&#xD;
happy to assist Edward, if you will permit him, and, indeed,&#xD;
I shall take it as a great favor."&#xD;
Mrs. Rhoda's first thought was to refuse, but a moment's&#xD;
reflection told her that four hands would be better than two,&#xD;
especially as she was very anxious to have the garden&#xD;
weeded; besides, they would be directly under her eye; there-&#xD;
fore, she consented.&#xD;
Mrs. Banks then spoke of Ned's ankle, and the cause of the&#xD;
injury. The old lady hastily interrupted her:&#xD;
"J~ell di~wn! I thought he had, by the look of his clothes&#xD;
when lie came home. If he 's hurt his foot, I 'm glad of it.&#xD;
What business had he to go near the oxen 'I But I don't&#xD;
believe a word about it. He 's callers inakin' up some lie or&#xD;
other!"&#xD;
"]~ut his ankle is really badly sprained, Mrs. Tallman, and,&#xD;
as it was done in assisting my child, I think I ought to attend&#xD;
to it, though I know I shall not do it so skilfully as you&#xD;
would."&#xD;
"Skilful or not," began Mrs. Rhoda, "I shan't find ban.&#xD;
&#xD;
dages and liniment for every little scratch that young one&#xD;
gets. But you can do as you 1ike~ You can afford it I&#xD;
suppose!"&#xD;
Mrs. Banks took no notice of the sneering emphasis which&#xD;
Mrs. Rhoda placed upon her last remark, but said mildly:&#xD;
"Ii trust IL shall never be too poor to be grateful - espec-&#xD;
ially to one who has, perhaps, saved the life of my child."&#xD;
"Umph!" muttered the old dame, as the door closed on&#xD;
her visitor. "I should think she 'd got young ones enough of&#xD;
her own to look after, without troubling herself with the town&#xD;
poor. But 't would be 4.just the same if she had a dozen. I&#xD;
knew she had n't any faculty."&#xD;
George soon joined Ned in the g&amp;amp;4den; and, though Mrs.&#xD;
Rhoda watched them sharply, she never caught them even&#xD;
once gathering the currants or otherwise neglecting their work.&#xD;
Therefore, when George came in after tea, and asked if Ned&#xD;
might go home with him and have his ankle bound up, she&#xD;
said, "Do go along and done with it!"&#xD;
The ankle was duly cared for; and then there never was,&#xD;
in Ned's opinion, such curiosities as the children displayed to&#xD;
his admiring gaze. There was little Allan's new alphabet,&#xD;
gayly printed on Bristol'board which "brother Fred." had&#xD;
brought him from the city; there was, also, Allan's file of&#xD;
tin soldiers, a sadly mutilated set, some wanting an arm and&#xD;
some a head, but all the more natural, as Qeorge observed,&#xD;
for it proved they had seen actual service. Then, there was&#xD;
George and Sarah's box of books - a wonderful box, ~to say&#xD;
nothing of its contents, with Doctor Franklin pasted on the&#xD;
centre of the lid, flanked on either side by run-away appren-&#xD;
tices, stray horses, dogs, cows, ships~ steamboats, hats ~ind&#xD;
muffs; while directly above his head ran a locomotive with a&#xD;
whole train of cam. Ah! it was a wonderful box quito a&#xD;
Picture-gallery in itself......,.and it seemed as if Ned would never&#xD;
tire of looking at it and asking questions. They had scarily&#xD;
come to the books when Mrs. Banks re4n4~ tl~em that Mrs.&#xD;

&#xD;
Taliman had not given Ned permission to stay, and might be&#xD;
displeased if he did not return. The children were very&#xD;
anxious to have him stay just to see on~ more, and Ned looked&#xD;
very wistfully at a red-and-blue Robinson Crusoe which sat&#xD;
holding the gentle Zama by the halter, in the book that&#xD;
George had just opened; but when Mrs. Banks repeated her&#xD;
remark, saying, if he went now, Mrs. Tailman would be more&#xD;
willing, perhaps, to' let him come again, he turned away reso-&#xD;
lutely, saying, "Please, ma'am, won't you ask her?"&#xD;
"I will," and the kind widow kept her word. Mrs. Rhoda&#xD;
consented, though in no very gracious manner, muttering,&#xD;
"If he was there, he would be out of her way."&#xD;
So little Ned became a frequent visitor at Mrs. Banks'&#xD;
apartments. As his bashfulness wore off, she found that he&#xD;
was coarse and rude in his language and manners, - how&#xD;
should he be otherwise? - and very ignorant.&#xD;
She did not, reject him, however, as a bad boy who would&#xD;
contaminate her own children, but her kind heart yearned&#xD;
over him, and she strove, by kind and gentle teachings, to lead&#xD;
him to "overcome evil with good." It was long before she&#xD;
could perceive any radical change, in those respects, yet her&#xD;
"faith was large in time," and she did not despair.&#xD;
She was right. In her room he caught glimpses of child-&#xD;
hood's fairy land, from which he had been excluded from his&#xD;
birth. lIe was not ungrateful, and gradually her smile of&#xD;
approvall or glance of reproof came to have more influence&#xD;
over him than all the cuffs he had received from his birth,&#xD;
and these had been neither few nor far~ between. He cer-&#xD;
tainly was a better boy, or Mrs. Rhoda a better woman; for,&#xD;
though she continued to raise her hand in the old scientific&#xD;
~ ~nri~riner, the blows were much less frequent and heavy. Pos-&#xD;
~bl~ a breath of the atmosphere of quiet happiness that per.&#xD;
vaded Widow Banks' rooms had stolen through the key-hole&#xD;
*     (Mrs. Rhoda usually kept the doors locked t~ keep out the&#xD;
*     children), arid somewhat softened the acerbity of her disposi-&#xD;
&#xD;
tion; or, perhaps, the change might be traced to the many&#xD;
daily little attentions and deeds of kindness which Mrs. Banks&#xD;
persisted in showing her, notwithstanding the indifferent and&#xD;
often coarse manner in which they were received.&#xD;
Bat to whatever influence we ascribe it, iii is very certain&#xD;
that she one day called all the children to her door and divid-&#xD;
ed between them some fine large apples, and not only gave&#xD;
Mrs. Banks permission to fasten her clothes-line to a post on&#xD;
her portion of the yard,- a f~vor which she had peremptorily&#xD;
refused when she first came there, -but even accepted an in-&#xD;
vitation to take tea from that lady. Unfortunately, this visit&#xD;
did not terminate as happily as Mrs. Banks hoped, for the old&#xD;
lady did not fail to criticize the management of her children,&#xD;
and enlarge on her own superior method.&#xD;
"My boys were never allowed to litter up a room like&#xD;
that," she exclaimed, pointing to a corner where George was&#xD;
engaged in manufacturing a chair for Sarah's doll, while she&#xD;
and Allan watched the progress with delight. "If they&#xD;
wanted to whittle, there was room enough out of doors, and&#xD;
that was the place for theme"&#xD;
"Yes, I highly approve of out-of-door exercise for both&#xD;
boys and girls," said Mrs. Banks, innocently; "but I find,&#xD;
if we leave children too much to themselves, they are liable to&#xD;
get into mischief, - contract evil habits, and "-&#xD;
"iDo you mean to 'twit me to my face.?" cried the old&#xD;
woman, angrily. "I guess my boys were no worse than some&#xD;
others, and some folks that I know may live to see theirs hu'ng&#xD;
yet !" and, jerking her head up and down like a beetle against&#xD;
a wall, she marched out of the room, banging the door behind&#xD;
her.&#xD;
For several weeks after this visit, she met all Mrs.&#xD;
attempts at conciliation with a frostiness that wo~l4 b~tv~&#xD;
chilled a less hopeful nature; but gentleness and paL~nce,&#xD;
combined with faith and love, can do much even in oux world&#xD;

&#xD;
of discord; and, in time, they did not fail to soften the anger&#xD;
of Mrs. Rhoda.&#xD;
To the surprise of the whole neighborhood, Mrs. Banks con-&#xD;
tinued to reside in the house until her lease expired; then, in&#xD;
hope of obtaining better employment and being nearer her son&#xD;
Fred., she removed to New Haven.&#xD;
It was a sad day for Ned Norris when the Banks family&#xD;
left M-; how sad none but thQse whose childhood has&#xD;
been lone and friendless as his can tell, and God grant&#xD;
they may be few! He had earnestly promised the good&#xD;
widow to remember her teachings, and to try to be a good boy;&#xD;
but, as he stood on the steps, watching the slow progress of&#xD;
the wagon that bore his friends and their few household chat-&#xD;
tels away, the prospect of ever being able to fulfil that prom-&#xD;
ise seemed to grow more and more hopeless; and when it&#xD;
turned the corner into the great stage-road, and GeorgQ waved&#xD;
his hat for the last time, he burst into tears.&#xD;
To the honor of Mrs. Rhoda's nature be it recorded that&#xD;
she did not box his ears, or make any demonstration towards&#xD;
it, bu~ contented herself with saying:&#xD;
." Well, well, boy, there 's no use in crying. George could&#xD;
not stay here forever. You '11 find enough to~ cry for, before&#xD;
you die, without crying after him, though I must sa~y," she&#xD;
added to a neighbor who had run in to see them start., "that&#xD;
he4s one of the best-behaved boys I ever saw; and the won-&#xD;
der is how he comes to be so, for his mother has n't got the&#xD;
least faculty for managing children.~~&#xD;
"I never thought she had much faculty fbr anything; if&#xD;
~e had, she kept it to herself, for she was u't a bit sociable,"&#xD;
replied the woman. "She was always kinder queer."&#xD;
"Queer or not," said the old woman, rather testily, "she&#xD;
had a~ few bad streaks as anybody I know, and everybody&#xD;
has some.~,&#xD;
Ay, and everybody has some "good streaks," friend Rhoda;&#xD;
but thine, which had been drawn out and made faintly lumi-&#xD;
&#xD;
28A&#xD;
&#xD;
nous by the sun of Love, soon began to fade in its absence,&#xD;
and, in a few weeks, became dim and dingy as before.&#xD;
Little Ned felt the change, and, between the bitter temper of&#xD;
the old lady and the influence of his old habits, became dis-&#xD;
couraged and discontented, and almost ceased to wish to bQ a&#xD;
good boy.&#xD;
But he did not forget his friends; and when Dick Mills,&#xD;
the stage-coach driver, occasionally brought him some such&#xD;
trifling presents from the Banks family as their limited&#xD;
means enabled them to procure, he longed for something&#xD;
to send in return - some little thing to ptove that he&#xD;
was not forgetful or ungrateful. But all his little keepsakes&#xD;
had been their gifts, and if he sometimes received a penny or&#xD;
two for some slight service rendered a neighbor, they were&#xD;
always taken into the close keeping of his old mistress.&#xD;
One summer day, he was at his old work in the garden,&#xD;
when there came a thought to him which brightened his face&#xD;
at once. There was the raspberry-bush in the corner of the&#xD;
garden; his bush, - for even Mrs. Rhoda called it his,- with&#xD;
its fine, large, delicious fruit just beginning to ripen. "They '11&#xD;
be almost as big as acorn-cups," he said, eying them with de-&#xD;
light, "and I '11 send them. I don't believe they '11 get any&#xD;
in New Ha~Ven half as nice.&#xD;
But the nezt thing was a basket to put them in. He&#xD;
would not ask Mrs. Rhoda for one, because he feai~ed being.&#xD;
forbidden to think of such nonsense. After s~verai futile at-&#xD;
tempts to construct one from some old splinters he found in&#xD;
the garret, he gave it ~p, a d decided to ask his friend, Dick&#xD;
Mills; to lend him one. I so happened, that the d~y pre$.&#xD;

his berries, Mrs. Rhoda         to be absent from~ hon~e.&#xD;
She set some cold food on the table for his dinnerand, after~&#xD;
laying out work enough to keep him busy through~, the day,&#xD;
left him alone..&#xD;
Ned worked very industriously until he began to grow&#xD;

hungry, and cast frequent glances toward the noon..mark on&#xD;
the kitchen window-sill. At length the lazy shadow orept&#xD;
quite up to the notch, and he was proceeding to the house to&#xD;
get his dinner, when he observed a forlorn-looking Indian&#xD;
woman coming~ down the street with several baskets dangling&#xD;
from her arm. Seeing him look at her very earnestly, she&#xD;
came up to the gate, and asked him to buy one. There was&#xD;
one just the size he wanted. Ah, how he longed to possess&#xD;
it! The splinters were so smooth and white, the red and&#xD;
yellow stains upon it so gay and bright, lie did not heed&#xD;
the woman's jargon, but stood turning round and round, with&#xD;
a very wistful look, until her "You '11 take it, my little man,&#xD;
it 's only a sixpence!" aroused him, and he put it back,&#xD;
with a sigh, saying, "No, no, I can't."&#xD;
"If your mother would just give me a bit of dinner for it,"&#xD;
suggested the woman.&#xD;
Mother! Ned sighed again; but, suddenly remembering&#xD;
his own dinner, he asked her to wait a moment, and, running&#xD;
into the house, he brought out the bread and meat that Mrs.&#xD;
Rhoda had left for him, and asked if that would answer.&#xD;
"Yes, my man, though cheap as dirt at that," she replied,&#xD;
as she took the food, and placed the basket in his hand.&#xD;
Ned hid his prize in the thick currant-bushes, and returned&#xD;
to his work in high spirits, and with such a good will that&#xD;
even Mrs. Rhoda, on her return, condescended to say that&#xD;
he had done quite as much as she expected.&#xD;
After supper he ~gathered his berries, and covered them with&#xD;
a nice piece of white paper, wgich George Banks had given&#xD;
him. He was stealing past the dpor, when his old mistress&#xD;
saw him, and called him hack. "Her great handkerchief,&#xD;
her great red cotton handkerchief," was missing, and he was&#xD;
toquired to give an account of it. He disclaimed all knowl-&#xD;
edge of it; but a glimpse of the basket, which he in vain&#xD;
tried to' hide behind him, aroused her suspicions at once.&#xD;
"Whose basket is that? Where did you get it, and what&#xD;
&#xD;
have you got in it, you little scamp?" she cried, angrily, as&#xD;
she snatched it from his hand.&#xD;
"It is n't there. I have n't got it nor seen it," cried the&#xD;
boy, earnestly, as she tore off his paper cover.&#xD;
"What 's all this? Where did you get the basket of&#xD;
berries, and what are you going to do with them?" she re~&#xD;
pleated.&#xD;
The boy was obliged to repeat the story of his purchase of&#xD;
the basket, but as soon as he mentioned the Indian woman,&#xD;
her anger burst forth with tenfold fury. Regardless of his&#xD;
repeated declarations that the woman did not enter the gate,&#xD;
and that he had not seen the missing article, she insisted that&#xD;
the squaw had stolen it, or that he had given it to her in ex-&#xD;
change for the basket.&#xD;
Again the blows fell thick about his ears, and in a manner&#xD;
that proved that her right hand had by no means "forgotten&#xD;
its cunning." "There! into the house with you, you little&#xD;
lying, thieving rascal ! "she exclaimed, driving him before her&#xD;
to the door.&#xD;
The color mounted to th~ boy's cheek as he paused, and,&#xD;
facing her, said firmly, "I am no liar. Will you give me my&#xD;
basket?"&#xD;
"Your basket!" she replied, mimicking him. "I should&#xD;
like to know by what means it became ~~ours. ]Y guess&#xD;
you '11 learn not to peddle off my things again to a drunken&#xD;
squaw - thief'"&#xD;
The boy cast on her a fierce look of hatred and defiance&#xD;
as she placed the basket in the cupboard, and ordered him&#xD;
to bed. lie went to his garret, swelling with rage and dis-&#xD;
appointment. " She shan't have it!" he muttered, as he&#xD;
sat down on his bed, with clenched fists. "I hate her worse&#xD;
than eVer. I 'II steal it and run away.. I '11 g&amp;amp; this very&#xD;
night!"&#xD;
Mrs. Rhoda's bedroom door stood open, but Ned~s tare&#xD;

board, and seized upon his basket; neither did the slight rate&#xD;
tling of the kitchen latch, as it yielded to' his pressure, disturb&#xD;
her slumbers.&#xD;
The next moment he stood beneath the quiet stars, as&#xD;
friendless as on the day of his mother's death. But he was&#xD;
too young to reflect'; besides, he was very, very angry; and he&#xD;
walked down the street with a firm step and tearless eyes,&#xD;
until he reached the stables of the village inn. There were&#xD;
watchful eyes not easily cheated, and out sprang old Lion,&#xD;
Dick Mills' great dog, with a low growl; but, instantly recog-&#xD;
nizing him, he sprang upon him, wagging his tail, thrusting&#xD;
his nose up to his face, and manifesting his delight by quick,&#xD;
short barks.&#xD;
The boy's whispered "Get out! Get down, Lion!" o~ily&#xD;
made him redouble his gambols; and, fearing to wake some&#xD;
one in the house, if he spoke louder, he permitted the dog to&#xD;
go on, until he reached the outskirts of the village.&#xD;
Wobla old Lion! He had an older claim on the boy's&#xD;
heart than even the Banks family. After they moved away,&#xD;
he was the only thing the child had to love, or that returned&#xD;
his love.- Ned felt this, and there was a choking sensation in&#xD;
21      th'ro~t as he pushed his old friend down, and strove to&#xD;
spk~tern1y to him, and drive him back. Perhaps Lion was&#xD;
corc~i&amp;amp; of this struggle, for he did not obey, but, springing&#xD;
in advance a few rods, lay down directly in his path, and,&#xD;
laying his head between his outstretched paws, looked up in&#xD;
his faee with s~~h wistful, beseeching expression, that the&#xD;
poor boy sat down' by the road-side, and burst into tears. At&#xD;
'length he brushed them away from his' cheek, and, 'patting&#xD;
the old do~9s head, said:&#xD;
"No, no, old Lion, you must n't go. They would say I&#xD;
'stole, you, too, it suppose. Go home! Go back, sir !" he&#xD;
continued, ste~u1y. The dog retreated a step or two, and&#xD;
stood eying ~him with the, same wistful look. Ned caught up&#xD;
a stone, and, turning aw~y his heads hurled it at him. The&#xD;
&#xD;
dog gave a' low hoarse growl, and turned towards home. The&#xD;
boy went his way, but, in spite of his efforts to restrain them,&#xD;
the tears rolled slowly down his cheeks, and he often turned&#xD;
as if he expected nay, hoped - to see old Lion at his&#xD;
heels. At sunrise he was crossing the long 'bridge on the&#xD;
eastern side of the city. His heart sank within him at the&#xD;
sight of so many houses glittering and gleaming beneath the&#xD;
morning sunlight, for how should he ever find the one in-&#xD;
habited by Mrs. Banks? Then he began to ask himself&#xD;
what that good woman would say. She might blame him,&#xD;
and, perhaps, send him back. He grew irresolute. Once or&#xD;
twice he ventured to ask some boys, whom he met, to tell him&#xD;
where Mrs. Banks lived; but a quizzical reply, or a shout of&#xD;
laughter, was all he received. Weary, hungry and discouraged,&#xD;
he wandered along Water-street, until he found hir~iseIf in the&#xD;
vicinity of Long Wharf, where he sat down on a pile of&#xD;
lumber, and watched, with a listless gaze, the movements on&#xD;
board of a brig' which was fitting out for sea. The scene&#xD;
soon became a very busy one. Drays and carts began to&#xD;
rumble along the street; then came gentlemen on 'foot and in&#xD;
carriages, whose very canes had a business-like look, an4~&#xD;
finally, a large drove of mules which, amidst kick~&#xD;
snortings and no verj gentle coaxings from the sal&#xD;
transferred to the brig's deck. The boy became i~: Wd1&#xD;
and drew nearer and nearer, until he sat down on a b~t;olo~&#xD;
to the vessel's side. Two portly-looking gentlemen stood&#xD;
there talking with a powerful, athletic m~n, with a profusion&#xD;
of dark crispy hair, slightly sprinkled with. gray, and a;i~ open~&#xD;
good-humored f~ce, barring a slight irritable expression of im-&#xD;
patience. They were about to leave the spot,~ when the latter&#xD;
turned, as 'if to give some further orders, to ~ an~pu board&#xD;

"Up with y~u~ my lad!" he cried, hastiIy~ '~hat ~box&#xD;

see that it is carefuUy stowea." lie was turning away, when,&#xD;
struck by the boy's eager, earnest look, he said, impatiently:&#xD;
"Well, out with it, my lad. What do you want?"&#xD;
"To go to sea, sir," replied Ned, instinctively.&#xD;
"To go to sea.!" replied the captain, - for it was none&#xD;
other, - gazing at. him from head to foot, with a quizzical&#xD;
look. "What berth do you expect to fill? Do you know a.&#xD;
marling-spike from a rope's end?"&#xD;
'KNo; but I can learn, sir.~~&#xD;
"True enough, and in more ways than one, too. What do&#xD;
you expect?"&#xD;
The boy looked up inquiringly.&#xD;
"I mean what do you expect me to pay for your valuable&#xD;
services?"&#xD;
"What you please, sirs"&#xD;
"Come, Ifliugham," said one of the gentlemen, who had&#xD;
stood, during this conversation, impatiently tapping his boot&#xD;
with his gold-headed cane; "you have shipped one boy, and&#xD;
that is enough."&#xD;
"2But the rascal has sent word he can't go, and, as you in~&#xD;
sist on my taking out these passengers, I must have some one&#xD;

lie then turned to Ned, and, by a few well-directed queries,&#xD;
4~ew f~r6m him his whole story.&#xD;
"The old sea-cow!" he muttered, as Ned related the cause&#xD;
of his running away. "Well, you got your basket; I 'm&#xD;
glad of' that. You~ are good grit. You shall go with inc.&#xD;

duly notified them of Ned's elopement, and their faces wear&#xD;
such~ a serene, self-satisfied look, that we scarcely need to hear&#xD;
Esq. G-'s closing remark, "There is no need of making&#xD;

convince us that they are very public-spirited men, and&#xD;
have a very distinct idea of the difference between dollars&#xD;
and souls.&#xD;

Down springs J)iek 2NIills, whose short, stout figure and rnbi-&#xD;

A hax~dsome, manly-looking fellow, in a blue round-about&#xD;
jacket and a Panama hat, steps out and returns the old woman's&#xD;
greeting.&#xD;
"Ned' Norris!" We did not need her exclamation to tell&#xD;
us that, for the eyes and hair are the same, though those&#xD;
heavy whiskers are a foreign growth, and his cheek, between&#xD;
wind and, weather, has deepened to an oriental hue. ]~e turns&#xD;
to~the Carriage, and pretty Sarah Banks, who has been his&#xD;
wife for more than a 'twelve-month, carefully places 'a butidle&#xD;
in his arms. What can it be?. Some rare eggs, perhaps, or&#xD;
a new set 'of choice crockery for Mrs. Rhoda's table;. some-&#xD;
thing, at least, which he is very anxious to show her, for,&#xD;
awkwardly enough, he begins to undo the fastenings, while&#xD;
the old dame scolds, and Sarah, springing to the ground, says,&#xD;
as she takes it from him, "Do wait, dear Ned, untjl we get&#xD;
into, the house!~'&#xD;
In a few moments they are seated, and the skilful hands of&#xD;
S~raEyemove the soft wrappers, and out looks a baby - a&#xD;
beautiful, blue-eyed baby, fresh and fair as an angel. ~O,&#xD;

"I&#xD;

from Fred.'s wife.&#xD;
Ah M~s. Rhoda has found her heart. See how iher old&#xD;
eyes flU with' tears while she protests that Ned is "kinder to&#xD;
her than hei~ own soti could be, and that she has not the heart&#xD;
to take a single thing now he has a. family of hi~ own to sup-&#xD;
port. ~Xt 's robbing the baby; ~od bless it!"&#xD;
"Never mind the baby, Aunt Rhoda," replies Ned, laugh-&#xD;
ing.' "I can manage to fill his mouth ~nd a~ dozen mom, if&#xD;
need be, for t6-morrow morning I sail master of the 'Orion,'&#xD;
if wind and 'tide are fair; so give the baby to me, mother,&#xD;
and get us a good dinner, for we must g&amp;amp; ~back in the return&#xD;

he gained the command of a fine new 'brig. For some years&#xD;
he had supplied many of Mrs. Rhoda's wants, and though he&#xD;
wholly refused to take her into his family to live, as Sarah&#xD;

Eunice's lecture on the extravagance and degeneracy of the&#xD;
times that permitted a woman to wear a silk dress anywhere&#xD;
dave' to church. However, your mother listened with meek-&#xD;
ness~ and was well repaid; 'for the old woman loaded us down&#xD;
with good things when~e canw home. She is kind, I think,&#xD;
&#xD;
though certainly queer. But they~ are rich, and can't live&#xD;
forever."&#xD;
The above i~ hut a fragment of the conversation that took&#xD;
place between Mrs. Murdock, o'f Mi~dletown, an4)i~W young&#xD;
friend, Melinda Dutton. Melinda was an orphan, tl~&amp;amp;jet of&#xD;
a doting grandmother, who had done all she could towards&#xD;
spoiling her. She w~is ignorant, unttained and conceited, -&#xD;
not that she had lacked faeilit~es for education; fbrr her grand-&#xD;
mother had ~sentherto the most fashionable 'school~ in the&#xD;
city, and she had, as the old lady proudly observed," I eexi'&#xD;
through all the branches;" yet of all that was useful and&#xD;
necessary for one in her condition of life sh&amp;amp; was wholly&#xD;
ignorant. Nature had given her a q~iick, b$ght intellect, and&#xD;
a loving heart, yet, at sixteen, she was indolent, ignorant,&#xD;
self~willed and diseontcntcd.&#xD;
Melinda's another had died soon after her birth, and ~her&#xD;
father had spent most ~of his time at the Bo~Zth, 141in busihes4&#xD;
was lucrative, yet his habits were $uch:that~t his death there~&#xD;
was nothing left for his child. The grandt~other di4 not loi*&#xD;
survive him~ and left the 'girl not only portionless, but nearly&#xD;
friendless. In a remote corner of our town the old lady had.&#xD;
a brother and sister still living. They were unmarried, and,&#xD;
when informed of her death, wrote to offer a home to her&#xD;
orphan grandchild. It was this letter that gave rise to the&#xD;
above conversation.&#xD;
Mrs. Murdock has given her impression of Aunt ]~nice;&#xD;
now, dear reader, let me give you nnne She ~ i~t~ in~&#xD;
deed, anything like Melinda~s grandmother, but a slvewd,&#xD;
strong-minded, energetic ~w~xnan, who' knew little, and q~red&#xD;
less about that portion of the world which could not be seen&#xD;
from the old farm-house door, where she had always 4welt&#xD;
with her brother Jonas. Her prepossessions and preJt~dices&#xD;
were very strong, and not easily changed, for she 'was seldom&#xD;
contradicted, none of~tlie neighbors caring to' '~get into a&#xD;
8narl" with ~Aunt Euaioe, Her tong~ie was swift and sharp,&#xD;

her manners somewhat rough; but she had a true, kind heart,&#xD;
though the way to reach it often seemed somewhat intricate.&#xD;
She bad about her that kind of rude dignity and that' marked&#xD;
individuality which are Veculiar to people who, as one of our&#xD;
hard-fi~ted neighbors expresses it, "never look up to nobody&#xD;
but themselves ~ "and, for all such as ~allowed themselves to&#xD;
feel or manifest ~ny craving to be "fishionable and gen-&#xD;
teel," she felt a heartier contempt than a Thrk feels for a&#xD;
Christian.&#xD;
Personally, she was fine-fooking, tall and erect, with eyes&#xD;
of that deep, brilliant blue whose intensity often surpasses&#xD;
those of a darker shade, ~and high but well-cut featured, indic-&#xD;
ative of great firmness and decision of character. At three-&#xD;
score not a single line of silver thridded the mass of dark-&#xD;
brown hair which seldom suffered the confinement of cap or&#xD;
bonnet, and her 'skirts were of the narr&amp;amp;West fashion, and her&#xD;
short-gowns of the most antique pattern possible, made up&#xD;
from ht~u~ stores of home-made flannel, or, in summer, of gay&#xD;
chintz ~Vhich she had purchased years ago. A flannel ~blanket&#xD;
in winter, and one of Uncle Jouas' east-off straw hats in sum-&#xD;
mer, answered for head-gear; and in this guise she appeared&#xD;
in the great yard back of the house, at sunrise every morn-&#xD;
ing, with her milking-pails on her arm and a great bowl of&#xD;
corn-meal in her han4, followed by a motley group of hens,&#xD;
ducks, geese and turkeys, gobbling, crowing, cackling and&#xD;
screaming, while her own sharp voice was heard ab&amp;amp;~te the&#xD;
die, lecturing some belligerent pld turkey-cock or gormandiz-&#xD;
ing gander, or in' softer* tones' commending some mothei~ly ~old&#xD;
hen; for, like most, childless women, she had contracted 'the&#xD;
habit of talking to everything, animate and inanimate, as if&#xD;
it ware human. Her house was scrupulously neat, but she was&#xD;
too iii~Uch of an utilitarian to cover her floor with a carpet&#xD;
"plagny dirty things, good for nothing but the moths;"&#xD;
neither had ~he sofas, lounges or ottou~xans, but her parlor was&#xD;
furnished with great arm-chairs, and these were piled full of&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
woollen blankets with all sorts of striped borders, and cover~.&#xD;
lets of all imaginable patterns.&#xD;
On the cherry bureau, and in the corners of the room, were&#xD;
divers rolls of homespun cloth, linen, and woollen, and linsey-&#xD;
woolsey, shining cam-colored flannel for her own use, and. but-&#xD;
ternut-colored ~' dress cloth" for Uncle Jonas' wear. Aunt&#xD;
Eunice did not like black, it'" was such a rotten color."&#xD;
The old-fashioned round table was guiltless of lamps or&#xD;
books, or engravings, but, at the proper season, was covered&#xD;
with great pewter platters, full of sliced apples, or peaches,&#xD;
or berries, drying for winter use. The walls were garnished&#xD;
with sundry bunches of yarn, and from a projecting beam&#xD;
hung the old people's Sunday suit.&#xD;
The sitting-room or, as they called it, the "out-room," was&#xD;
scarcely less bountifully furnished. Here were, usually,&#xD;
baskets of apples standing about, and, across the hearth in&#xD;
summer, stood Aunt i~unice's great wheel, while close at hand,&#xD;
on the red chest, lay several bunches of wool-roll~ ~ra~fdy~or&#xD;
spinning at moments of leisure from the kitchen.&#xD;
Eunice's peculiar province waS the kitchen; here her ~lory '~&#xD;
was reflected in the bright tins which lined the shelves, the~&#xD;
pails and noggins, the quantities of dried beef, and string of&#xD;
apples, pumpkins, red pepper and herbs, that dangled from~&#xD;
the beams overhead. The great wooden screen before the&#xD;
fire was hung with clean linen bags, and, perchance, a shhi~&#xD;
or pair of trousers of Uncle Jonas'; and, in each corner of&#xD;
the yawning fire-place, stood the dye-pot sand salt-mortar -&#xD;
those lares of our fathers' hearth-stones, quite as useful 'and.&#xD;
quite as venerable as those of Rome~ or Pompeii ~v certainly&#xD;
quite as venerable, for, who, IL ask, ever saw a new salt.&#xD;
mortar?&#xD;
Here, Aunt Eunice had spent sixty years,~ busy, independ-&#xD;
ent, contented, and happy- happy, except at ti or three&#xD;
periods, when she had been trouble with tlAe suspicion that&#xD;
Uncle Jonas thought of getting married. And'~ she was&#xD;

respected and beloved too; for the sharp words and stinging&#xD;
proverbs which she bestowed upon her neighbors were pretty&#xD;
sure to be followed by4 kind deeds.&#xD;
But I must not forget Uncle Jonas. Dear, kind, sunny-&#xD;
hearted, Uncle Jonas! with his, benevolent smile, his quiet,&#xD;
thoughtful manner, and his few, yet pleasant, words. ille&#xD;
was the patriarch of the neighborhood, whose footsteps were&#xD;
hallowed by angels, in the shape of little children, who gath-&#xD;
ered around and looked upon him with love and reverence.&#xD;
Of course, Melinda Dutton was very poorly qualified to&#xD;
appreciate or enjoy her new home. Mrs. Murdock's words&#xD;
were not. without their influence, and they constantly recurred&#xD;
to her mind, after she was seated in the stage-coach that was&#xD;
to convey her to Maplehurst; and, by the time that vehicle&#xD;
stopped at the rustic tavern where she was to get down, she&#xD;
had come to seriously regard her old relatives with excessive&#xD;
repugnance, and to pity herself as the most unfortunate and&#xD;
wr~et~,. , s~f mortals.&#xD;
~ ~ou brought my niece, Mr. Green?" asked a full-&#xD;
tone~i, pleasant voice, as the driver opened the coach-door. It&#xD;
was Uncle Jonas that spoke, and who went forward and care-&#xD;
*Wly assisted her to alight. His words were so kind and&#xD;
cheerful, his manner so cordial, as he-led her into the house,&#xD;
and asked about her journey, that the girl's brow grew clearer,&#xD;
and she watched his movements, as he transferred her baggage&#xD;
to his square farm-wagon, with unexpected interest.&#xD;
The Dudley farm was about three miles from the village.&#xD;
They were soon on the road, and, as they passed along, Uncle&#xD;
Jonas pointed out the old farm-houses, and told her the names&#xD;
of the owners. The sun set soon after they left the village;&#xD;
the twilight deepened, and as the road crept carefully and&#xD;
cautiously on among the hills, and grew more and more&#xD;
rugged, the old man relapsed into, silence. The moon arose;&#xD;
gradually the dark shadows fled; ~nd the dewy forest-leaves&#xD;
quivered and glittered like glad living spirits, as the soft&#xD;

moonbeams slid down among them in search of the swe~t,&#xD;
fragrant flowers. It was a new scene to Melinda. There&#xD;
was that in her nature that answered to it, and she uttered a&#xD;
low exclamation of delight.&#xD;
"Ay, yes, the heavens declare his righteousness, and all&#xD;
the. people see his glory!" said the old man, in a deep, low&#xD;
tone, involuntarily slackening his horse's pace, and raising his&#xD;
eyes reverently to the heavens above them.&#xD;
They turned into a dark, narrow lane, overhung by the&#xD;
luxuriant branches of the cherry-trees that shaded it, and, soon&#xD;
afterwards, the horse stopped, and Uncle Jonas, pointing to&#xD;
th9 dim outline of the old farm-house, shut in by trees, told&#xD;
her that was her home. He had scarcely ceased to speak&#xD;
when Aunt Eunice appeared, coming frGnl the house with a.&#xD;
tall candle in her hand, which she was trying to screen from&#xD;
the current of air, alternately addressing that and the old&#xD;
house-dog, who was manifesting his delight at his master's&#xD;
return, by barking and gamboling directly in her path.,&#xD;
"Get out of the wayr you black scamp! Be stil1~Xjt~y~ I&#xD;
There, &amp;amp;weel out, will ye, - plague on -the pesky thib~! I&#xD;
wish I 'd got the lantern. Jonas! I say, Jonas, is that y094&#xD;
And have you got Lindy 'I"&#xD;
"Yes, here she is, Eunice, - you can't mistake that face! "~&#xD;
he said, leading the girl forward; "she 's a Dudley, every&#xD;
inch of her."&#xD;
"So much the better!" cried the old woman, shaking her&#xD;
heartily by the hand, and raising her light to get a better&#xD;
view of her fac&amp;amp; "You 're the last of a good stock, for&#xD;
Jonas never 'will get married now, and I 'm proper glad. you 'ye&#xD;
come to live with us. But come in, child'; you are tired and&#xD;
hungry as a bear, I dare say."&#xD;
Melinda followed her into the honse, and was soon seated&#xD;
at a table loaded with eatables, but arranged in a manner that&#xD;
greatly disturbed all h~i~ i4eas~ of propriety. There was ~t.&#xD;
great platter of cold beef, flanked by plates of butter, smoked&#xD;

* beef, pickles, cakes and pies. On opposite corners of the&#xD;
table the old lady had placed a loaf of bread, and almost a&#xD;
whole cheese. Between the old people stood a pitcher of&#xD;
cider, whieh they drank alternately with their tea.&#xD;
"Out for yourself, ]Iiindy!" said the old lady, handing&#xD;
over the loaf and a sharp knife, The girl hesitated, and she&#xD;
continued: "I s'pose you are 'used to having a whole plate-&#xD;
ful cut up every time you eat, just as Thankful Stone did&#xD;
here, last winter, when I sprained my ankle. But I put a&#xD;
stop to it pretty quick. What was left was all dried up, and&#xD;
Miss Thankful did not like dry bread nor odds and ends any&#xD;
better than other folks, and IL was n't going to stand dog for&#xD;
the whole family. It 's rank waste to cut up bread in that&#xD;
fashion!"&#xD;
After being pressed to take this and that, and "jest a&#xD;
crumb more" of something else, Melinda withdrew from the&#xD;
table, and surveyed the kitchen with visible astonishment.&#xD;
All was strange, and Aunt Eunice, rattling away her dishes,&#xD;
asking~her questions about her journey, lecturing he dog, or&#xD;
inquiring about some sick person, or society matters, of Uncle&#xD;
onas, strangest ~f all.&#xD;
The next morning Melinda rose at a late hour, and made&#xD;
her way to the kitchen.&#xD;
"Good morningtindy! You look chirk as a cricket!"&#xD;
was the old lady's greeting. "Come, get your breakfast,"&#xD;
she, continued, taking a covered dish from the hearth. "Jonas&#xD;
and I eat two hours ago, but we thought we 'd let you sleep,&#xD;
seeing you had come so far yesterday." ~&#xD;
"Breakfast!" echoed Melinda, with a g1anc~e at the old&#xD;
clock. "Why, it is but eight o'clock now, and we never haye&#xD;
breakfast until that time, in town!"&#xD;
"Then you are a pesky lazy ~set! I should,, faint clear&#xD;
away before that time. Why~ could n't you get it before?",&#xD;
"Because we never got up; or grandmother used to get&#xD;
&#xD;
MEILt~TDA DUTTON.              $01'&#xD;
uptG be sure, but she never called me until it was ready, and&#xD;
that was at eight."&#xD;
"Well, then, she did not do her d~ity by you," said the ~ld&#xD;
woman, bluntly. "IL gj.iess you'll have to turn over a new&#xD;
leaf here. 'Airly to bed and airly to rise' is qur creed."&#xD;
The girl ate her food in silence, then loitered to the window&#xD;
and looked out. After a while, ~he said, "What a lonesome,&#xD;
dreary, out-of-the-way place this is, aunt! I wonder how any&#xD;
one in his senses i3ould think of building a house here!"&#xD;
"Your great-great-grandfather, Ambrose Dudley, settled&#xD;
here before the old war, and if he wasn't as wise as any of~&#xD;
your city folks, I should like to know it. He was a justice&#xD;
and a deacon. Besides, when folks have enough to do, they&#xD;
aren't apt to find fault with such an old homestead as this,"&#xD;
replied the old lady, dryly. "But, come, child, if you 'ye&#xD;
nothing else to do, wash up the breakfast dishes, and let me&#xD;
see how smart you can be; but, lawful sakes!" she added,&#xD;
glancing at Melinda's light muslin, "you don't expect to&#xD;
wash dishes in that gown, IL hope. It 's as bad as white, and&#xD;
flimsy as a cobweb."&#xD;
"It is one of my usual summer dresses, aunt. As to&#xD;
housework - I never washed a dish in my life!"&#xD;
"Well, now, if that don't beat the T~utch V E'n-a-niost&#xD;
seventeen, and never washed a dish!"&#xD;
"iJou~ework is for servants. No lady does housework&#xD;

"Genteel! ~i. poor, good-for-nothing set of critters they&#xD;

"Child ! "-~-- and the old lady was quite erect, while she flour-&#xD;
ished the bunch of scouring-grass which she held in her hand,&#xD;
with double vigor,-" from Ambrose Dudley down, your fore-&#xD;
fathers have been prudent, pains-taking, industrious people.&#xD;
They never grudged a poor man a meal of victuals or a load&#xD;
of wood; but they were saving, and, thought it no disgrace to&#xD;
work. My father was well to do in the world; when he&#xD;
died we all shared alike. Your grandma married and set up&#xD;
for a fine lady, and spent all her part years before she died.&#xD;
Jonas and I have held our own, and added something to it,&#xD;
mayhap. I don't want to boast; but let me tell you, child,&#xD;
w~ aren't going to. squander what we have. Why should I&#xD;
keep servants? I have to slave hard enough now, and I&#xD;
don't want a pack of servants to manage. I would n't take&#xD;
all the southern negroes as a gift."&#xD;
"0, I would! There ought to be slaves everywhere to do&#xD;
the drudgery. But I suppose it is of no consequence how&#xD;
people'live in such a place as this. In the city you would&#xD;
ka~e to live like other people."&#xD;
"I.tave to! I 'd like to see them that would make me&#xD;
have to be such a lazy, good-for-nothing critter. I 'd like to&#xD;
know, Lindy, if the folks in Middletown are all monkeys, that&#xD;
they must ape one.another? They read their Bibles, I sup-&#xD;
pose, and don't they know that He who made all things pro-&#xD;
vided two hands for every mouth, and that he that won't work&#xD;
sha'n't eat? Learn to help yourself child, and always&#xD;
remember that the highest price you can pa~$r a favoi~ is&#xD;
to ask for it."&#xD;
Melinda soon found that it would not be so easy to hw~4&#xD;
"her own way out there" as ~he fancied. Aunt tunice, 1~-&#xD;
garding all her previous~ habits and opinions with inexpressi-&#xD;
ble contempt, was determined to make her a thorough house-&#xD;
keeper, and ~he was a much xnore formid~~liaraeter thail&#xD;

&#xD;
as yet, not quite wise or gentle enough~ ~tQ undertake to&#xD;
remodel her niece's character with any great hope of success.&#xD;
Melinda set about her tasks with considerable zeal, influ-&#xD;
enced ,as much by the novelty of the thing as a desire to make&#xD;
herself useful. But her ignorance, her carelessness, and,,&#xD;
aboVe 'all, her endless inquisitiveness, hourly exhausted her&#xD;
aunt's small stock of patience. Besides, Aunt Eunice had a&#xD;
way of her own for doing things, and would tolerate no inno-&#xD;
vations, and Melinda soon developed a strong passion for&#xD;
experimenting. If she moulded the bread, it was sure to be&#xD;
after some new method her own; or, if her aunt charged&#xD;
her to stir the cream "round with the sun," she would invam&#xD;
riably stir it the other way, to contradict, by experiment, her&#xD;
aunt's theory.&#xD;
"I tell you, Lindy, you '11 bewitch that cream. It '11 never&#xD;
come until doomsday if you stir it that way. It mi~st go&#xD;
round with the sun!"&#xD;
"The sun does n't go round, aunt. It 's the earth that&#xD;
moves; it 's more philosophical to stir it in this way."&#xD;
"Fiddlesticks-ophical V Are you blind or turning fool, to&#xD;
say the sun don't go round? Why, look yonder. A little.&#xD;
while. ago you might have reached it with a pole, e'enamost,&#xD;
from the top of High hill. Now it has got clean away up in&#xD;
the sky, - and d~n't it go down every night behind Joe&#xD;
Page's woods?"&#xD;
"So it seems, aunt. But every child knows that the sun's&#xD;
motion is only apparent; it seems to rise and set because the&#xD;
eatth revolves on its own axis every day, something~ in .this&#xD;
way;" and Melinda caught up a ball of yarn, and began twirl-&#xD;
ing it round, in illustration of her theory..&#xD;

would be smashed into inch pieces ~"&#xD;
"Why, aunt, I supposed no one doubted the fact. As to&#xD;
standing on your head and breaking your dishes, all that can&#xD;
be philosophically "-&#xD;
"Lindy, Lindy Dutton, I care nothing about your ~oso-&#xD;
phy! What' I do know I know for sartin. If you had&#xD;
studied your Bible more, you' would n't be so ignorant.&#xD;
Did n't Joshua command the sun to stand still? and would&#xD;

Joshua, the son of Nun, knew as much as some folks now-a-&#xD;

"But, aunt "-&#xD;
"Silence! Don't let me hear. any more such heathenish&#xD;
notions! I wonder how sister Rachel could let any one put&#xD;
such dreadful things into a child's head. It beats 'all!"&#xD;
Melinda had too much of her aunt's spirit to have her&#xD;
grandmother censured without an attempt at vindication.&#xD;
But this course only made the old lady more caustic and&#xD;
peremptory. They did not take kindly to each other. ' Me-&#xD;
linda had a quick and loving appreciation of beauty, - Aunt&#xD;
Eunice saw nature' only in a 'potato patch or field of turnips.&#xD;
In her view everything Was useless 'that did not directly min-&#xD;
ister to physical needs or fill a purse. As to spiritual needs,&#xD;
she did not recognize any as legitimate save such as could be&#xD;
amply satisfied by reciting the catechism and listening to two&#xD;
sermons on the Sabbath. Therefore she forbade' ~ll the girl'~&#xD;
attempts to adorn the ample door-yard with shrubbery, and&#xD;
made endless war on all such things as "briars and weeds&#xD;
stuck into pots to clutter up the house;'~ saying she felt it&#xD;
her "bounden duty to break her of such shiftless habits.'~&#xD;
With Uncle Jonas the girl was on bette~~rms. To him&#xD;

of those kind souls who find it difficult ~q frown, or believe&#xD;

unconsciously attached to him, lie would have made it all&#xD;
sunshine in the house; but though, in reply to his sister's&#xD;
daily catalogue of the girl's faults and misdemeanors; he spoke&#xD;
many calm, wise words, the~clouds would stay.&#xD;
The old lady had limited her niece's society to a few fami~&#xD;
lies for whom she had a particular regard. But the girl soon&#xD;
grew weary of these pronouncing the girls "animated&#xD;
churns," and the young men more stupid than their oxen.&#xD;
Not far from the Dudley farm, though on a more frequented&#xD;
road, lived Mr. Ilatton, the father of Tim Hatton, the bank-&#xD;
rupt, whom Aunt Eunice denounced daily with inexhaustible&#xD;
bitterness. It was shrewdly suspected that the great leather&#xD;
pocket-book in which she kept her deposits was miuzts sev-&#xD;
eral hundreds through Tim's failure. However this might&#xD;
be, ~hc~re was no reason to doubt her sincerity when she&#xD;
declared that she "e'enamost hated the whole bum' on&#xD;
'em!"&#xD;
Melinda occasionally saw the flatten girls at meeting.&#xD;
Their dress and manners indicated pretensions to fashion quite&#xD;
above those of the families she was accustomed to visit, and&#xD;
she wished to make their acquaintance, partly because she&#xD;
expected to find more in common, with them than with the&#xD;
others, and partly from a strong desire to contradict Aunt&#xD;
Eunice, and have her own way. Accident favored her; they&#xD;
met at the village st6re, whither she sometimes accompanied&#xD;
Uncle Jonas. The young clerk introduced them, and, in a&#xD;
few moments, they~ had commenced an ardent intimacy. They&#xD;
were pleased with her, and she readily promised to call on&#xD;
them to meet their brother's wife, who was a Middletown&#xD;
woman, and knew several of Melinda's friends.&#xD;

&#xD;
wilful, unflinching obstinacy on the other. Henceforth Me~&#xD;
linda threw aside 'all seeming restraint or respect for her&#xD;
aunt's commands, and even Uncle Jonas began to view her&#xD;
character with serious apprehensions. Had Aunt Eunice&#xD;
been guided by a more intelligent appreciation of the girl's&#xD;
mind, or more largely furnished with the wisdom of winning~&#xD;
souls, it might have been otherwise. But she was not con-&#xD;
scious of her own shortcomings, of course, and laid all the&#xD;
blame on her niece, whom, she said, "a bad bringing-up had&#xD;
completely spoiled." So, when winter came with its lonely&#xD;
sights and sounds, Melinda grew more and more unhappy and&#xD;
dissatisfied, and longed to get away.&#xD;
One evening, as she sat moodily watching the patches of&#xD;
snow as they slid from the boughs of a hemlock tree ne~r the&#xD;
window, she was startled by the unusual sound of sleigh-bells&#xD;
in the lane. Presently a sleigh paused before the door, and&#xD;
a gentlemaii sprang out, whom she at once recognized~' as a&#xD;
Mr. Langley whom she had known in Middletown. He was,&#xD;
at present, cl~frk in a large wholesale store in New York.&#xD;
He was spending a few days with some friends in the village,&#xD;
and, hearing that Melinda was in the place, had called to see&#xD;
her. She was delighted with this mark of attention; he was&#xD;
handsome, fashionable, agreeable, and conversant .with all the&#xD;
details of that life for which she so ardently ~pined. He&#xD;
called frequently during his stay in M-.--~, took her to ride,&#xD;
or whiled away the hours by her side, and soon read in her&#xD;
manner that tale which no man ever reiLds with indifference.&#xD;
At first this knowledge awoke no feeling but gratified vanity.&#xD;
But soon other feelings began to unite~with this, and, guided&#xD;
by motives which he did not stop to analyze, he continued the&#xD;
intimacy, until her whole soul was bound up in him. His&#xD;
visits were very disagreeable to ~Annt Eunice, who, partly&#xD;
from instinct aud partly from prejudice, disliked him, But&#xD;
she did' not mmonstrate wisely, nor even show any o~ that&#xD;
maternal wisdom that is so well versed in the mysteries of&#xD;
&#xD;
womanhood. Melinda refused to give up Langley, and began&#xD;
to meet him by stealth.&#xD;
"Full oft they met, as dawn and twilight meet&#xD;
In northern climes; she full of growi~ig day,&#xD;
As he of darkness,"-.&#xD;
until '-but why need i[ say what followed? lit was the old&#xD;
story'- old as passion and time. 14cm the fresh, up-gushing&#xD;
fountain of her heart there arose a mist of golden splendor,&#xD;
through which she failed to see the heartlessness and ~elfish-&#xD;
ness of him in whom she trusted. She' loved, was deceived,&#xD;
led astray and destroyed; but no, not entirely, not forever&#xD;
destroyed.&#xD;
It was only when she found herself deserted, miserable,&#xD;
suffering, destitute, and an outcast in a distant city, that the&#xD;
delusion utterly vanished. Then she saw that the halo ~f&#xD;
light in which her eyes had been dazzled was but a reflection&#xD;
from her own passionate nature, and in her misery and utter~~&#xD;
self-abasement she longed to die. Then it was, 'with the&#xD;
blush of shame on her cheek and its keener burnings in her&#xD;
heart, that she began to feel that her old relatives, in spite&#xD;
of their peculiarities, had been her only true friends.&#xD;
Never had the old farm-house known such a commotion&#xD;
bcne~th its roof~ as on the morning succeeding Melinda's&#xD;
flight. At first the old people could not believe her gone;&#xD;
and, when they could no longer doubt it, they were fill4~with&#xD;
anxiety, dismay a#id grief Aunt Eunice spoke her indigna-&#xD;
tion, weeping the' while with heartfelt~ sorrow; and lIJficle&#xD;
Jonas, with great misgivings, endeavored to hope that all&#xD;
might yet be well.                        /&#xD;
More than a year passed, and nothing was heard from Me~&#xD;
linda beyond a few vague rumors. i~frerything at the old&#xD;
house had settled into its habitual gait, when one evening, as.&#xD;

&#xD;
brought me a letter from the store. From Esq. Gleason, I&#xD;
s'pose, something about the deed~ for the grist~mi1l."&#xD;
She took the letter up while he arranged his glasses, but&#xD;
laid it down with a contemptuous -&#xD;
"I wonder if he calls that thing a J? I vum, I can. do&#xD;
better myself! Squire Phge's writing was as plain as print.&#xD;
But now-a-days, when folks pretend to know everything, their&#xD;
larnin' is like Cinda ~ones' 1k~nnel, all thrui~s. Now I think&#xD;
on 't, Jonas, I want you to get me some walnut bark in the&#xD;
morning. I want to color my blanket yarn."&#xD;
Re was too much absorbed in his letter to heed her remarks.&#xD;
She caught a word or two occasionally, as he read on, pro-&#xD;
nouncing each word in an audible whisper, as was his habit.&#xD;
At length, she interrupted him:&#xD;
"What 's that, Jonas? Who 's destitute? What the&#xD;
rosset ails you, man? John Doolittle has n't failed, has&#xD;
he?"&#xD;
"No, no," he said, in very tremulous tones. "It's about&#xD;
Lindy, poor child ! "&#xD;
"Lindy! you don't say, Lindy! What of her? Where&#xD;
is she ? -~ is that letter from her?"&#xD;
"Read it," he replied.&#xD;
"What, I read such writing as that! I can't make head&#xD;
nor tail to it. It 's worse than goose4racks. Read it your-&#xD;
self, Jonas."&#xD;
He read the letter aloud. It was written, without Melinda's&#xD;
knowledge, by a person who had known her in Middletown,&#xD;
and was well acquainted with her subsequent history. It&#xD;
gave a touching account of her present condition, and pleaded&#xD;
earnestly with Uncle Jonas to go to her, forgive her, and take&#xD;
her back. Uncle Jonas' voice grew husky, and it was not&#xD;
without considerable swallowing and clearing of his throat,&#xD;
that he read the note to the end. In Aunt Eunice's heart the&#xD;
fountain of pride was still quite as deep~ as the fountain of&#xD;
pity, and she exclaimed:&#xD;
&#xD;
"There, Jonas, it has turned out just exactly as I always&#xD;
said it would. The~ minute I set my eyes on that feller,&#xD;
Langley, I knew he was a good-for-nothing scamp, and I told&#xD;
Lindy so over and over again; but I might as well have&#xD;
talked to the east wind. She has made her own bed, and&#xD;
now she must lie on it. She has found out now, I guess, who&#xD;
knows best!"&#xD;
The old man ~at in deep thought, slowly folding the letter&#xD;
and saying to himself:&#xD;
"Poor child ! -her mother died when she was such a little&#xD;
girl. Ii 'm afraid we were too hard with her. She wasn't used&#xD;
to our ways, - and, then, she was so good sometimes. Poor&#xD;
dear, what will become of her?" He seemed weighing some&#xD;
great question; at length he arose, and both his looks ~nd&#xD;
words evinced that the decision was made.&#xD;
"Eunice," he' said, "you may put me up a mouthful of&#xD;
something to eat, and get my other clothes ready, for it 's a&#xD;
considerable of a long way to New York, and I shall want to&#xD;
start pretty early. I '11 just step over to neighbor Page's and&#xD;
get Joe to come over and look after th6 cattle and do chores&#xD;
while lam gone."&#xD;
"Why, Jonas Dudley! you don't mean to goto New York!&#xD;
How are you to find the way? You '11 get lost, and robbed,&#xD;
and 'murdered! And what can we do with Lindy, here?&#xD;
How can she ever look anybody in the face again?"&#xD;
"We 'II treat her kindly, Eunice, and do our duty by her,&#xD;
as I 'm afraid we did not when she was here. And if she is&#xD;
a good girl and behaves herself now, I tell you, she shan't be&#xD;
put upon by anybody. She 's got sadly out of the way, and~&#xD;
mayUps, we have our share of blame for it. Think of the&#xD;
poor, young thing dying among strangers! and remember our&#xD;
blessed Savioth' had words of peace and forgiveness for those&#xD;
Worse than she."&#xD;
Aunt' Eunice was softened. "Sure enough ; I wonder how&#xD;

heart to have TAndy turn out so dreadfully. May-be I was&#xD;
te~ty, too, and did n't have as much patience as I' ought; but&#xD;
you shall bring her home, Jonas, and I don't care if folks talk&#xD;
till their tongues blister."&#xD;
She was thoroughly roused by Melinda's need of pity, and,&#xD;
long after Uncle Jonas was asleep, she was still up, busily&#xD;
engaged in making preparations for his journey - prepara-&#xD;
tions that would have sufficed for a journey to Oregon.&#xD;
It is well to listen to the voice of sorrow. Aunt Eunice&#xD;
had an intense family pride, and an intense scorn for all such&#xD;
erring ones as Melinda, and she felt these things as women&#xD;
frequently feel them; bnt now, attacked as she was from a&#xD;
new quarter, they were completely broken down and dis-&#xD;
comfited.&#xD;
She went about her household affairs, reflecting upon the&#xD;
influences under which Melinda had grown from a child, and&#xD;
with a growing feeling of self..accusation as to the circum-&#xD;
stances under, which she went astray, until there was born in&#xD;
her heart a larger sympathy. New light and warmth gushed&#xD;
in; and the "winged seed dropped 4lown from paradise,"&#xD;
which had lain so long smothered, started into sudden and&#xD;
rapid growth, rooting %~ut many of the strong, rank weeds.&#xD;
When the ilay fixed for their arrival came, she was rest'.&#xD;
lessly;~ busy' in perfecting the minutest preparation for ~he&#xD;
invalid. Once or twice, when everything seemed in readi-&#xD;
ness, she drew out her wheel and tried to spin. But the flax&#xD;
would- slip from the distaff, and the thread catch in the fliers,&#xD;
until, half angry with herself, she put it away, and piled&#xD;
up nearly half a load of wood in the capacious chimney&#xD;
corners.&#xD;
At last, while she was yet in the chamber doing something&#xD;
add to her arrangements, the joyful bark of the old dog&#xD;
announced their approach. She hastened down, and met&#xD;
Jonas a~' he entered the house, bearing his shrinking, sob-&#xD;
bing niece in his arms, 'as he would have borne a little ehild.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Heaven be praised, 'Jonas, you 'ye got back alive and'&#xD;
brought our 'child with you!" she cried. "I 'ye had the&#xD;
fidgets about you, TAndy ; - child, don't cry so! I 'in proper&#xD;
glad to see you; I never was so glad to. see any one in my'&#xD;
life!" she added, as Melinda hid her face in h~r cloak, and&#xD;
sobbed still more bitterly. "Let me take off your cloak,&#xD;
child.?'&#xD;
"Glad to see me, autit ~" said the poor girl, attempting 'to&#xD;
look up. "Can you, indeed, forgive me ? - forgive all the&#xD;
sorrow and distress I have caused you? O~ you are too&#xD;
good!"&#xD;
"No, not good ; - the Lord' knoweth, not good. I 'ye&#xD;
been to blame. If I had been a true mother to you, I don't&#xD;
believe you would have gone astray. But I ~ll do better,&#xD;
now ~ and' you '11 do better, and may the Lord forgive us all!&#xD;
But, that Langley I shall hate him as long as I live and&#xD;
breathe!"&#xD;
Aunt )~unice proceeded to untie the gi~l's hood, and Dielin-&#xD;
da's tears fell 'fast on her hands, as she said:&#xD;
"Heaven Hess you, aunt! I had not dared t~ hope for&#xD;
this!"&#xD;
"It has blessed me already, child, in showing me my~ errors&#xD;
and bringing you back to us. I should have rern~knbered that&#xD;
you had neither~ father nor n~other.' But I 'If try to be a&#xD;
mother to you now, TAndy." Aunt Eunice's tears caine~i~ast,&#xD;
and she drew down' her glasses and said to Uncle Jonas, "Do&#xD;
open that entry door, Jonas. It smokes here enough to put&#xD;
one's eyes out. It 's that pesky back-stick; I knew it would&#xD;
smoke when I put it on."                         ~'  ~'&#xD;
Many weeks passed before Melinda was able to leave her&#xD;
room. ~Had 'there 2been no change in Aunt Eunice's manner,'&#xD;
there would have been a total change in her sense of it; for, ii*~&#xD;
her experience of suft~ring, she had learned wisdo* But&#xD;
Aunt Eunice wa~ changed; she strove hard to overcome h~er&#xD;

pared herself for the severest reproaches, and this unusual&#xD;
tenderness, that avoided even the mention of her error and&#xD;
disgrace, was, as she said, "too much." Poor girl! she felt&#xD;
these words~and looks to be the good angels that were&#xD;
_______ To breathe away&#xD;
The 4lust o' the heart 'with holy air."&#xD;
She came forth to the world a new creature. Her saddened&#xD;
woman's nature,-whose crown had fallen, made itself a beauti-&#xD;
ful wreath of the flowers of faith, humility and patience, which&#xD;
suffering had caused to spring along her path. Serene and&#xD;
strong in her love for all that was good and beautiful, she&#xD;
became t~ her old relatives a ministering angel, and watched&#xD;
and tended '~i~eir old age with unwearied love and care. And&#xD;
even Aunt fl~utiice came to see how divine it is to have com-&#xD;
passion on the sinning, to save the soul that is '~ready to&#xD;
perish.&#xD;
It may not be amiss to add, that on the death of her old&#xD;
relatives, when their, great estate became hers, Henry Langley&#xD;
again appeared, and sought to make her his wife. Buti, to hi~&#xD;
surpri~e and confusion, he did not Ilnd the thoughtless girl that&#xD;

which ever4yit~oh villain deserves.~ Firmly and patiently she&#xD;

"You are angry with me, Richard," she said, "angry with&#xD;
your own little Annie."&#xD;
For a second, Richard Fanshaw returned her earnest&#xD;
glance; then a smile broke round his mouth, and stole upward&#xD;
to his eyes, .chasing away every trace of his petulant mood.&#xD;
"No, no, Annie, I am not angry only sorry that you&#xD;
awoke me so soon. I was wrong to speak so hastily; but sit&#xD;
~ down here, you little mischief!" he continued playfully, draw-&#xD;
ing her down by his side, "and I will tell you my dream.&#xD;
There, sit where -&#xD;
He paused, and looked at hcr with an air of' bewildered&#xD;
surprise.&#xD;
"What is the matter, now, Richard? Are you going to&#xD;
sleep again, ~r do you expect to put me to sleep?" asked the&#xD;
girl, archly&#xD;
"Hush ! - sit still, Annie. Do not stir%" he replied, in&#xD;
almost a whisper. "There - now the resemblance is wonder-&#xD;
ful. I could almost think it was she."&#xD;
"She ! - who?" said Annie, starting up and looking round&#xD;
as if she expected to see a third person peeping from behind&#xD;
some one of the forest-trees.&#xD;
"The Maiden of the Fountain, child. There was some-&#xD;
thing in your face, just then, when the slant sunbeams from&#xD;
between the branches, of yon old maple fell on your head, that&#xD;
reminded me~strQr~g}y of her. There, now, those mischievous&#xD;
dimples have spQiled it all. But sit down and watch the&#xD;
bright water While I tell you all about it.&#xD;
"I had traced the 'branch' from the 'notch' down to the&#xD;
mill-dam, Annie, in search of trout, and, tired of my unsuc-&#xD;
cessful morning's sport (if sport it can be called), I struck&#xD;
across the woods for home. I reached the spring, and, after&#xD;
slaking my thirst, lay down under the old birch, and watched&#xD;
the sunbeams that came prying through every nook and&#xD;
crevice in the thick green leaves, peering up the ravine yon-&#xD;
der, as if haunted by a sense of something far more beautiful&#xD;
&#xD;
than they had yet discovered, -just like me, Annie, ..- and&#xD;
the beautiful, and, in many~ cases, grotesque grouping of the&#xD;
old trees yonder, with their deep, motionless shadows changed&#xD;
to delicate mosaic by the restless fingers of the saucy sun-&#xD;
beams. Then I mused on those beautiful fables of ancient&#xD;
Greece, of which I told you the other day; of that simple&#xD;
faith that peopled forest and stream with living spirits, thus&#xD;
recognizing its .own intimate relations with Nature, until my ~&#xD;
vivid fancy re-created that time in all its freshness, and&#xD;
peopled this spring and woods with the shapes of many a&#xD;
'fallen old divinity.' I fancied that I saw more than one fair&#xD;
face peering shyly from the green depths of yonder clump of&#xD;
young chestnuts, and but you laugh, Annie. This is all&#xD;
nonsense to you.''&#xD;
"Not exactly, Richard. I do not know na~b. about Gre-&#xD;
cian mythology, to be sure; but sometimes, when I ha'v'e come&#xD;
along through the woods from school, I htwe fancied that the&#xD;
trees were talking to each other, and have stopped to listen;&#xD;
but, though I stood very still, I could never catch a word;&#xD;
for, when I stopped, they became silent; and seemed watching&#xD;
and waiting for me to go on. But tell me more, Richard."&#xD;
With her hand in his, and her clear eyes raised to his face,&#xD;
the young girl listened while. Richard Fanshaw went on to&#xD;
tell how, busy with these fancies, he fell asleep &amp;amp;id wandered&#xD;

grinned at him from the murky atmosphere, and clutched at&#xD;
him. with their long, bony fingei~s wher~e~er he lost his foot-&#xD;
hold in the treacherous sands, or slipped by the dreary pools&#xD;
of wate;.~ their mocking tones were in his ears, filling him&#xD;
With terror; but above them all sounded one more fearful still,&#xD;
for it seemed like the voice of his own heart driving him&#xD;
onward to destruction. A terrible thii~st consumed him; his&#xD;
steps began to filter, and hi~ eyes to grow dim; but his hear-&#xD;
ing, like that of many dying people, became more acute, and&#xD;
he could still hear the mocking voices and resolve the dis-&#xD;
cordant sounds into words. One and all they cried, "Fool!&#xD;
dreamer!, trt~th is a fable. Purity and goodness are idle&#xD;
dreams! J~njoy the present, for there is no future!" while&#xD;
that strangel~r4~uniliar voice kept repeating the words in low,&#xD;
but distinctly audible whispers, as if it mused upon their&#xD;
import. Just as he was about to yield to their influence, his&#xD;
ear caught the sweet murmur of forest leaves, and a breath&#xD;
of pure, fresh air fell on his throbbing brow. His weary&#xD;
heart recognized them as heaven-sent messengers, and, rally-&#xD;
ing his strength, he sprang forward in the direction from which&#xD;
they came.&#xD;
The fearful, voices grew fainter, dying away like the wail-&#xD;
ing winds of autumn; his step grew firmer; his eyesight&#xD;
clearer, until every trace of that hideous landscape disap-&#xD;
peared, and there lay around him a scene of exquisite beauty,&#xD;
yet widely different from the one that had so enchanted him&#xD;
at first. That atmosphere had enervated while it intoxicated;&#xD;
but this was pure and.healthful as the kiss of a gentle mother.&#xD;
Suddenly, he came to a crystal fountain, shaded by a drooping&#xD;
birch, and set round with broad, cool stones; in short, it was&#xD;
very much like the spring at their feet, save that the waters&#xD;
werefar clearer, and the yellow sand at the bottom of a far&#xD;
brighter golden hue.&#xD;
How, ehol~ing with thirst, he eagerly knelt on the brink;&#xD;

&#xD;
but just as his greedy lip neared the water, a wondrously-&#xD;
beautiful maiden stood before him. Whether she rose from&#xD;
the fountain, as the agitation of sand at the bottom seemed to&#xD;
indicate, or stepped from the bole of the old tree, he could&#xD;
not tell. With one hand she gathered her loose rob~ about&#xD;
her, while in the other she held a few broad leaves of the&#xD;
Egyptian Calla, encircling the wand-like stalk with its creamy&#xD;
spatha and blossom. With this she motioned him back, and,&#xD;
in tones far sweeter than the murmur of the waters, though&#xD;
strongly like it, she said:&#xD;
"Mortal, what brings you to my fountain?"&#xD;
With an effort to loosen his parched tongue, he replied:&#xD;
"A weary, thirsty heart."&#xD;
"Drink, and thirst no more," she replied, folding on~ of&#xD;
the broad calla leaves in the shape of a cup, 'ai~id placing it&#xD;
in his hand.&#xD;
Richard Fansliaw paused, and sat for some moments look-&#xD;
ing thoughtfully into the spring.&#xD;
Little Annie, who watched his countenance intently, nestled&#xD;
closer to his side, and pressed the hand that still clasped hers,&#xD;
as if to remind him of her presence.&#xD;
"1 saw her no more," he said, at length, "for, just as I&#xD;
raised the cup to my lips, your love of mischief awoke me.&#xD;
Yet she must have been a real maiden," he continued, "for&#xD;
her hand was soft and' warm as yours, Annie; and, when her'&#xD;
fingers met mine, as she gave me the cup, a strange, indescrib-&#xD;
able feeling run through my whole frame; as if my heart&#xD;

We need harcTly~ say that Richard Fanshaw was a dreamer&#xD;
a dweller in the beautiful land of shadows.~ The love of&#xD;
beauty, from the undefined yearnings of childhood, had grown&#xD;
with his, growth, until it had become to him a passion and a&#xD;
hope; and, as he walked 'homeward, along the windjn~ forest-&#xD;

&#xD;
of his young companion, still dwelling on his dream, there was&#xD;
a light in his dark eye, and an earnestness, an exultation in&#xD;
his tones, that told, far more plainly than his words, how&#xD;
deeply his heart accepted 1~he dream as a prophecy that this&#xD;
hope wonic yet become a certainty.&#xD;
It would be not only a curious, but an interesting study, to&#xD;
trace out the circumstances that exercise a controlling influ-&#xD;
ence in the formation of such characters as that' of Richard&#xD;
Fanshaw. Of cours , the e timate must ever be partial,&#xD;
because connect ral~ t w re disposed to think that if those&#xD;
who are so ready to condemn, were to take the study up, or&#xD;
~~even to look into the history of their own inner life, they&#xD;
would gain some new lessons in psychology; and partake some-&#xD;
what more largely of that divine charity "that thinketh no&#xD;
evil."&#xD;
We have said that young Fanshaw was imaginative; but,&#xD;
until now, nothing had occurred to give shape and coloring to&#xD;
the vague reveries that thronged his busy brain. But this&#xD;
dream - this egeria of the 'fountain - caine like the angel of&#xD;
Bethesda to stir the slumbering depths of his heart, and fill it&#xD;
with passionate longings and delicious unrest.&#xD;
That form, those eyes, clear, dark and deep as' mountain&#xD;
springs, haunted him by day and night, and became identified&#xD;
with all the&#xD;
"Hopes, dreams, desires of wild ambition born,&#xD;
Whose dazzling light athwart ha early morn&#xD;
streamed radiantly, and on his spirit fell&#xD;
Like a. fire-baptism."&#xD;
Each day deepened the conviction~ that he was born to&#xD;
achieve a lofty destiny, and he brooded over the thought&#xD;
until the quiet monotony of Maplehurst b~bame irksome to&#xD;
him. With a. crowd of prQi4 aspirations rioting in his heart,&#xD;
he kissed the sobbing Annie, his pet and plaything from her&#xD;
birth, took th~ blessing of his dewy-eyed mother, end, eager&#xD;
&#xD;
to forestall time, threw himself into the. rushing' current of&#xD;
life.&#xD;
We may not follow him in all his wanderings through the&#xD;
world-wide search which his restless, haunte&amp;amp;jheart led him.&#xD;
Iceland and Italy, Germany and Arabia, the wila C~ucasian&#xD;
regions and those of "far 'Cathay," left, their cosmopolitan&#xD;
influence upon him,&#xD;
"~Until the mother that him bore&#xD;
Would scarce have known her child."&#xD;
We may not number the "shrines of beauty at which he&#xD;
put up prayers," - shrines before which his yearning heert&#xD;
lay hushed in prophetic anticipation, like the sea. beneath the&#xD;
rising moon; nor how they all proved but 4's~immer pilots&#xD;
unto the shores of nothing.&#xD;
Neither will we attempt to sound the depths of error into&#xD;
whioh his impetuous nature led him, the consequent suffering&#xD;
and self-renunciation. We love not such records, and, there-&#xD;
fore, hasten to say that after an absence of many years, gray&#xD;
at heart, world-worn, care-worn, with his ideal still unfound,&#xD;
and all his lofty dreams unrealized, he returned to his native&#xD;
village, and stood beneath the roof that sheltered his child-&#xD;
hood, a stranger.&#xD;
It is a quiet spot, Our Village, so quiet as almost to&#xD;
cheat Father Time ~himself into forgetfulness. Undoubtedly&#xD;
a blank leaf or' so in the church records had been filled out&#xD;
with births, deaths and marriages; the old brown houses had&#xD;
taken a dingier hue, and the button-woods before the doors&#xD;
cast a much broader shade than when he left; a railing had&#xD;
been added to the'bridge; but the &amp;amp;ld crossing-pole, back of&#xD;
hi~ mother's house, was still the same, even to t~ie patches of.&#xD;
green moss on ~s crumbling sides; and the stepping-stones,&#xD;
which he had laid' s~ many years before, were all in their&#xD;
places, with the clear water rippling around theni, exactly as&#xD;
of yore. But his mother slept in the grave-yard beyond the&#xD;

river, and his brother's gentle wife sat in her place, sur-&#xD;
rounded by a group of bright-eyed children, who were ready&#xD;
to hide their faces in the folds of their mother's dress at every&#xD;
word and c~ress from their dark-visaged, foreign-looking uncle.&#xD;
The news of his arrival flew with telegraphic speed, and&#xD;
old acquaintances, curious to hear his adventures, and eager&#xD;
to welcome him home, called to see him, and left the house&#xD;
disappointed. Instead of the bright-faced, joyous youth they&#xD;
remembered, they found a tall, dignified-looking man, polite&#xD;
but reserved, and little disposed to gratify their curiosity by&#xD;
becoming the hero of his own story.&#xD;
He heard, with more of interest than he had before mani-&#xD;
fested, that Annie Bradford was still unmarried, and, as soon&#xD;
as he could disengage himself from his visitors, he took the&#xD;
well-remembered path toward her dwelling. He had not&#xD;
gone many rods before he diverged from it, as if struck by&#xD;
some sudden thought, and took the more circuitous one that&#xD;
led round by the "Sibyl's Spring." That, too, was unchanged,&#xD;
and he stood and gazed into its clear depths, while old memo-&#xD;
ries gushed up from his heart as rapidly as the bright&#xD;
water from the golden land. Suddenly a light touch fell upon&#xD;
his arm. He turned, and met the clear, friendly glance of&#xD;
Annie Bradford.&#xD;
"Richard ! "-"' Annie! "- they. exclaimed in the same&#xD;
breath.&#xD;
With a thoughtful, yet eager look, as if he found there the&#xD;
key to the destiny whose shadow had so long lain upon his heart,&#xD;
he gazed into those clear eyes, now deepened and intensified&#xD;
by all the hopes of ripened womanhood, that were upturned to&#xD;
his, until the white lids grew tremulous,' and drooped involun-&#xD;
tarily. With ready tact, and something of her childish arch-&#xD;
ness, she said&#xD;
"Have you found her, the Maiden of 'the Fountain,&#xD;
Richard? You know you promised to bring her with you&#xD;
when you returned."&#xD;
&#xD;
He did not reply, but kept his eyes riveted on her face, as&#xD;
if it were the book of fate. At length a bright smile, like a&#xD;
star from behind a heavy cloud, broke over his sunburnt face,&#xD;
and he replied:&#xD;
"I lw;ve found her, Annie.~~&#xD;
"Where, where is she, then? They told me you came&#xD;
alone."&#xD;
Richard Fanshaw threw his arm around her waist, with&#xD;
the ~miliarity of days long gone, and, drawing her forward a&#xD;
step or two, pointed to the image of her own sweet face mir-&#xD;
rored in the limpid water.&#xD;
"There, Annie, there!"&#xD;
Again their eyes met, and the object of his long and weary.&#xD;
search was accomplished. His destiny was solved.&#xD;
Drawing her closer to him, he continued:&#xD;
"My toilsome search is ended, the dream of my boyhood&#xD;
interpreted. I bring you but a weary, thirsty heart. Will&#xD;
you accept it, Annie?"&#xD;
Her reply was lower, but far sweeter to his wayworn heart&#xD;
than the musical murmur of the watery. Once more they&#xD;
sat, hand in. hand, on the green moss beneath the old birch-&#xD;
tree, and, as Richard Fanshaw gazed on the fair face resting&#xD;
on his shoulder, and wondered at his stupid blindness, he re-&#xD;
peated more than once the words of one who has built to her.&#xD;
self a shrine in every loving heart:&#xD;
"0, happiness, how fat we flee&#xD;
Thine own sweet paths in search of thee I"&#xD;

THE OLD MAPLE.                823&#xD;

TIlE OLD MAPLE.&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
"I found him garrulously given,&#xD;
A babbler in the land."&#xD;
* "As each person has hisown separate iemembrances, giving to some&#xD;
places an aspect and significance which he alone can perceive, therc&#xD;
must be an infinite number of pleasing, mournful, or dreadful associa.&#xD;
tions spread over the inhabited earth." - Foster's essays.&#xD;
WAS it wholly the power of which wise John Foster&#xD;
speaks, that made the place so sadly pleasant, as I sat by the&#xD;
old maple, tracing with my fingers the seams in its rough&#xD;
bark, counting the incisions through which it had for years&#xD;
poured forth its life-blood to sweeten the teas, if not the&#xD;
tempers, of the Brae family, and - thinking? Or was the&#xD;
spell assisted by some "fallen ~old divinity" hid in its mas-&#xD;
sive bole? The divinity must have had a share in it, for IL&#xD;
remember noting a low, musical murmur among the swelling&#xD;
'buds above me, that were yearning in their velvet prisons to&#xD;
look out into the warm eyes of Spring. Let us reverently&#xD;
believe so, reader mine, for neither of us, I trust, belongs to&#xD;
that painfully wise class,&#xD;
"Who think all happy things are dreams,&#xD;
Because they-'~overstep the narrow bourn&#xD;
Of likelihood.'~&#xD;
It was a pleasant, sunny spot, - just like one of the "wee&#xD;
green neuks" you wot Of, fair lady, in some of the deep&#xD;
vales of your native state; too tame to be romantic, too&#xD;
quiet to interest hasty observers, and yet too ~w~et and dear&#xD;
&#xD;
to be forgotten. I doubt whether Mr. Brae, or his son&#xD;
John, who were on the knoll above me, ever thought of it&#xD;
otherwise than as a valuable part of their well-watered and&#xD;
productive farm. I. had not seen the place for years; and&#xD;
now I felt that, for me, it was written all over with heart-&#xD;
histories.&#xD;
And then just over the knoll was the old farm-house, with&#xD;
its spacious barns arid well-thatched sheep-cotes. I wondered&#xD;
if there were as many swallows' nests as of yore ~e1ustered&#xD;
beneath the eaves or plastered to the rafters of the barn;&#xD;
and if the old wren still built her nest in the hollow limh of&#xD;
the apple-tree that overhung the great horse-block by the&#xD;
gate. Ah~ me! I had gaged on many a masterpiece of art&#xD;
that seemed to glow with divine fire, and yet not one of them&#xD;
spoke to my heart more deeply than that same old, rude,&#xD;
misshapen horse-block. To us children it was a city of&#xD;
refuge when our happiness became too obstreperous for the&#xD;
long-suffering nerves of kind Mrs. Brae, or when, by &amp;amp;ny&#xD;
mischance, a slice of buttered bread came in too close contact&#xD;
with the floor. Thus in summer it was our table and play-&#xD;
room. There often, in the warm sunshine of the springs that&#xD;
will never c&amp;amp;ne again, were Nelly Brae and I perched, with&#xD;
a pile, of willow branches, and a broken penknife which we&#xD;
owned between us. 0, the whistles we made! for we did&#xD;
make some perfect ones, though often unsuccessful; and whez~j&#xD;
after a long attempts a perfect (that is, a very noisy) wh~sVI ~&#xD;
was finished, how proudly we sprang to our feet and poured&#xD;
forth otir notes of triumph!&#xD;
Do not frown; fot, believe me, we were daily told to "sit&#xD;
up straight and 'behave like women." But, somehow, the&#xD;
first puff of fresh air blew the less~ii~' out of our ,heads, A~d&#xD;
besides, all sorts of funny-looking rag babies lying about&#xD;
bore witness that we were sufficiently feminine. And we had&#xD;
dolls too...~.- real wax ~dolls; but,~ like some other careful&#xD;

common air. And there was also a ~whole set of acorn tea-&#xD;
cups and saucers stowed away in the great knot-hole under&#xD;
the second step of the horse-block, which served us for a&#xD;
china closet.&#xD;
On my right, as I stood there communing with the past,&#xD;
lay the wooded pasture, well kn~rn through the neighbor-*&#xD;
hood as the "maple lot." I looked for the narrow footpath&#xD;
by whicl~ we were accustomed to reach the "sugaPworks"&#xD;
sooner than by the rather devious eart~path. There it was,&#xD;
with~ its show of tender, green grass, looking like a narrow.&#xD;
green ribbon amid the dead, dry herbage of the preceding&#xD;
summer.&#xD;
I left my seat, and, following the path, crosse&amp;amp; the spring&#xD;
brook on the identical old stepping-stones, and ~t6~id on the&#xD;
spot that had so often been the village gathering-place -&#xD;
the very centre of mischief and frolic. It. was now sadly&#xD;
chan~ed~Uhe rude building was gone. The ~rough furnace&#xD;
was ~ixribling down, and from the rich, damp mould beneath&#xD;
sprang a tall sweet-briar. Ah! the glory had left i~he 'old&#xD;
sugar-works!&#xD;
Some of the "sugar.trees" were still standing. But I&#xD;
missed the stately form of many an c~ld friend, *hose Qrph~ic&#xD;
murmurs gave me a clearer insight into the mysteries of&#xD;
being than I have since gained&#xD;

very brown unibels of the gnaphaliuin crowned them with an&#xD;
everlasting crown.&#xD;
Re-crossing the b~~ok, I met Mr. Brae, and pointing to the&#xD;
old maple I expressed my joy to find it still standing.&#xD;
"Why, it is a kind of ci oked disciple," he replied, "and&#xD;
might as well be cut down. But, somehow, the children&#xD;
always took a kind of liking to it, especially Nell j~nd her&#xD;
little boy. I guess she was here as often as once a when&#xD;
she was at home last summer. And that little rogue, Harry,&#xD;
says his mother's tree shall not be cut down."&#xD;
Yes, Nelly loved that old tree, and well might its wide&#xD;
shade se~Xn'. to her a consecrated temple; for underneath its&#xD;
spreading Vr~nches she first listened to words and tones that&#xD;
became the charm of her life, and which death has no power&#xD;
to destroy.&#xD;

I have a word or two to offer touching Nelly ]3rae h~#~lf.&#xD;

in the training of his own children, were very strict, if not&#xD;
always very wise. But when he undertook to pursue the&#xD;
same course with little Nell, his heart turned traitor.&#xD;
When he had cause to reprimand her,~ie invariably began&#xD;
with a stern voice and still sterner look. But he never could&#xD;
proceed far before her slight, will&amp;amp;wy form would grow indis-&#xD;
tinct, and he would seem to hold in his arms a rosy infant,&#xD;
that lo~9d up in his face, and laughed and patted his wet&#xD;
cheeks, as he bent over the coffin that contained the dead&#xD;
form of its fair young mother, He would remember how his.&#xD;
own brave boy died before his child saw the light; how,&#xD;
after the mother was laid by his side in the church-yard,&#xD;
they brought the baby to the old farm-house and 1aid it in&#xD;
the long-unused cradle; how they sat by it, filled with heavi-&#xD;
ness and sorrow; and how the smiles that hroke over its&#xD;
face gradually kindled their minds to faith and joy. When&#xD;
the old man thought of all this, and how the child had been&#xD;
to th~m "a smile from God" to dispel the darkness from&#xD;
their pathway, his brow would relax, his voice grow tremu-&#xD;
lous, and his censures all change to blessings.&#xD;
Thus the child grew up like a bright wild-flower, planted&#xD;
in some quaint, old-fashioned garden. She seemed to' have&#xD;
established a secret correspondence with Nature, for "all&#xD;
things talked thoughts to her." Fot her each bird, flower&#xD;
and passing elo~id seemed to have a particular message. She&#xD;
always spoke of them as ~her bfrds, her flowers, her clouds.&#xD;
Strange fancies of this sort seemed to increase aS she grew&#xD;
older; and even on her wedding day, when j: flung a twig of&#xD;
ivy and a handful of sage into her lap, andlaughingly bade&#xD;
her study their meaning,; she gathered them up, andplacing&#xD;
them in her bosom, declared gravely that they should be the&#xD;
oracles of her household, and that her first ,are should be to&#xD;

Nelly Brae and I had been playmates from infancy. Our&#xD;
homes were on different roads, but we were near neighbors,&#xD;
for the long, triangidar tongue ~f lana between the roa4s~vas&#xD;
narrow, and the well-trodden path across it showed plainly&#xD;
that our families were not strangers to each other.&#xD;
We were still school-girls when Mr. Markham, the new&#xD;
pastor, succeeded in awakening the people to an interest in&#xD;
church music, which had been sadly neglected during the last&#xD;
years of good old Parson Mines. A liberal sum of money&#xD;
was subscribed, and a committee appointed to, arrange a sing-&#xD;
ing-school.                                 ,&#xD;

the cherished oi~'fWm whe~e ey~ and voic&amp;amp; he has since&#xD;

The projected singing-school became a matter of absorbing&#xD;

committee had been so fortunate as to engage Mr., Henry&#xD;
Wilson, a graduate of Yale College, and a personal friend of&#xD;

there was "no one to go with her," for John (the only son&#xD;
remaining at home) would not always come home when she&#xD;
did, and iDick and 1, she said, eould notf always come round&#xD;
that way, for the fields would sometimes be full of snow.&#xD;
]3esides, she conjured up such horrors of colds, wet feet, brain&#xD;
fevers, lung fevers and consumption, that Nell and I gave&#xD;
way in despair.&#xD;
Nelly was mortified and indignant at the thought of being&#xD;
ke~%t at ~home like a little girl, a child, when she was sixteen&#xD;
years, ten months, and I will not undertake to say exactly&#xD;
how many days, old. lint her slight figure, as well ~s grand-&#xD;

Th'&amp;amp;teacher was to spend two or three days. with his friend,&#xD;
Mr. Markham, before he commenced his sch'~ol. The morn-&#xD;
ing after his arrival in town, as Nell and 1 sat talking it over,&#xD;
and? considering what could be done in her behalf, we were&#xD;
almost beside ourBelves ~ith delight, to hear the old lady&#xD;
say, as she passed the, corner where we sat:&#xD;
"Well, well, child, 1 '11 see about it. You needn't feel so&#xD;
poorly;. maybe you'll go, after all. There is time ~nough&#xD;
to think about it between this and Thur8day night."&#xD;
We viewed the matter as settled, fbi~ Mrs. Brae's "1 '11 see&#xD;
about it" w always eqnivMent to a positive assent. Of&#xD;
this we felt ~o sure, that, dtirin~ recess at scl~ol that day,&#xD;
we talked only of the dresges we should wear to the singing-'&#xD;
school, and on our way home made the importantdecision that&#xD;
our hoods should be lined and trimmed with ~Ixnsou instead&#xD;
of pink. Therefore, I was someWhat surprised, that evening,&#xD;
to see Nell come panting in, and fling herself into a chair with&#xD;
..a I~I~k vf~ comical distress.&#xD;
"What i~ the matter, Nell ?" askad my mother and 1. to~&#xD;
gethet.&#xD;
"They will not let me go!"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Go where?" inquired my mother, who did not: under-&#xD;
stand.&#xD;
"To the singing-school," she replied, endeavoring to hide&#xD;
her tears.&#xD;
"Won't let yen go, Nell!" I cried. "Why, your granA-&#xD;
mother as good as promised you might go!"&#xD;
"Yes, but Mrs. Crane came over to-night, and made such&#xD;
a fuss about her 'Bubby,' and such dreadful complaints&#xD;
against me, that grandpa is ~really vexeU, and grandma says&#xD;
I shall stay at home till I can behave myself and ~keep~ut&#xD;
of mischief."&#xD;
"What has that great booby, bubby Crane, to d~ with&#xD;
your going to singing-school? Did n't you help him put on&#xD;
his mittens? IDid you let him fall down?"&#xD;
"Worse, though I did n't mean to hurt him. Yo~x know&#xD;
Aunt Mary gave me a box of rhubarb for grandmother.&#xD;
hubby Crane thought it was ground cinnamon, and teased&#xD;
me all the way home to let him taste it. Well, he called me&#xD;
stingy, and made such a~fuss that I opened the box and let&#xD;
him taste. I did n't Think he would be so greedy, but he&#xD;
lapped up a ~r~eat mouthful of it," she continued, with an&#xD;
expression of merriment dimpling round her mouth, "and I&#xD;
guess he s~rallowed a good dose. lit half strangled him, and&#xD;
I could not help laughing to see him spit. He ran screaming&#xD;
home, and humediately his z4other came over with a fLirid~us&#xD;

now-a.4ays are not half aS healthy, wise, or good as they&#xD;
were when she was young. She sang us old' tunes, which&#xD;
I praised. She made us sing with her, and qualified her&#xD;
praise of our singing~ by saying we should "do well enough&#xD;
if we did n't open our mouths so wide and sing so loud."&#xD;
We were all quavering away on "Majesty" when Mr. ]~rae&#xD;
-. entered, accompanied by Mr. Markham, and a stranger, who&#xD;
was introduced to us as our teacher, Mr. Wilson.&#xD;
"I wished Mr. Wilson to become acquainted with some of&#xD;
the families in the neighborhood, and 1 believe I have&#xD;
brougl~t him to the right place now, Mrs. Brae," said the&#xD;
minister. "" You are all singers, and my young friends here&#xD;
will atter~d the singing-schooj, of course."&#xD;
"~Fa1~ny is going, I believe," began the old lady. "I did&#xD;
think of sending Nelly, but she is so wild and mischievous&#xD;
that ehe will only trouble the gentleman. Besides, there is&#xD;
no one to go witja her; John is such a crazy head he wouldn't&#xD;
come home with her half the time."&#xD;
"0, you must let N~lly go! She has a beautiful voice."&#xD;
"Why, yes, she can sing a little," said the old man, look-&#xD;
ing at her proudly and fondly. "Come here, Nelly, 'and&#xD;
sing one of the old songs you sung to me last night. "~.&#xD;
Nell rose, and stood timidly by her grandfather.&#xD;
"Which' shall I sing?" she asked, without venturing to&#xD;
look up.&#xD;
"Either9; child; they were all good, for they were home&#xD;
songs.&#xD;
She began the old, ever beautiful, "Aftou Water," and&#xD;
sang it through in clear, unfaltering tones. ~1er voice was&#xD;
untrained, but full of deep, rich melody. Wilsox~ listened&#xD;
with evident surprise and delight. He turned to the old~ man,&#xD;
:" You., will not refuse to let her become my pupil, Mr.&#xD;
8rae! '~Such a voice as that should be cultivated 'by all&#xD;
means.&#xD;
&#xD;
The old man was pleased; Nell looked ~wistfully i~ his&#xD;
face, and he said, with a smile, "They are all on your1~ide,&#xD;
child. If there wa~4only some one to go with you, I wouldn't&#xD;
say a word."&#xD;
"Dick and I will come round this way, every night," I&#xD;
exclaimed, eagerly.&#xD;
"Ay, that would do, Fanny, if there were to be no&#xD;
snow."&#xD;
"If that is your only objection, Mr. ]3rae," said Wilson,&#xD;
"it can be removed, if you will trust your grandad&#xD;
my care. I shall board with your neighbor, Mr. ~ and,&#xD;
if you do not object, shall be happy to call for h~"&#xD;
The old people hesitated, and talked of the trqutile.. lIVEr.&#xD;
Wilson insisted that he could not do without Netl~r's voice;&#xD;
Mr. Markham seconded his proposal, and it was finally a~r~ed&#xD;
that Nelly should attend the school under Mr. Wilsori'~ es-&#xD;
cort.&#xD;
This arrangement pleased all but herself. "I wonder how&#xD;
you could tell him I shall go!" she said, as the door ,closed&#xD;
on the visitors.&#xD;
"Why, I thought you wanted to go, child."&#xD;
"So I do; but I don't want to go with him. lIe is so min~&#xD;
ister-like, that I shall not dare to breathe on the way. I&#xD;
wish Mr. Markham 'had not brought him here."&#xD;
Fie! child      id the grandmother. "Mr. Wils~n's&#xD;

'are afraid of him."&#xD;
"lean tim away frQm him, you know," said Nell, laugh-&#xD;

She did not run away from him, though4 After a week or&#xD;
two, she not only ~breathed with her4 accustomed ease, but&#xD;
laughed as merrily as ever. True she was not always iv,&#xD;

a row of icicles that hung from the topmost rail of the fence,&#xD;
~vhen she would hush us all to listen to their music, as they&#xD;
splintered in the still moonbeams.&#xD;
Harry Wilson was an indulgent guardian, and she soon&#xD;
found that the grave expression of his eyes could change to&#xD;
one of mirth, and that his somewhat haughty mouth could&#xD;
relaz into a smile as sweet and merry as her own. He soon&#xD;
became a great favorite with old and young, and his school&#xD;
succeeded admirably.&#xD;
We met in the White School House. As Mr. Wilson.&#xD;
wa~ usiially one of the last to leave, Nell, at his request,&#xD;
waited imtil he was ready to attend her. This soon drew&#xD;
the attention and excited the pleasantry of the older girls;&#xD;
but when Mrs. Morris, an empty-headed, gossiping busy-&#xD;
body, assured them that Mrs. Brae as good as asked him&#xD;
to wait on Nell, and that she knew that he wished the little&#xD;
plague a thousand miles off, their smiles became contempt.&#xD;
uous titters.&#xD;
As the weeks went on, they grew surprised, and-even indig-&#xD;
nant, to see that, instead of making an effort to shake off the&#xD;
"little plague," Mr. Wilson not only stopped an hour or so&#xD;
after singing-school, but passed most of his leisure evenings&#xD;
at Mr. Brae's.&#xD;
"What could he find there to interest him?"&#xD;
Had they asked him instead of Mrs. Morris, he might have&#xD;
answered, "A home!"&#xD;
Somehow he loved 'to be at Mr. Brae's; somehow he loved&#xD;
to sit by Nell, and hear her voice mingle with his in a favor-&#xD;
ite melody; somehow her wild .~olian tones gave his heart a&#xD;
fuller, brighter sense of existence. He taught her music be-&#xD;
cause he delighted to do so, and he did not ask himself why&#xD;
he taught her to drop "Mr. Wilson" and call him Harry.&#xD;
lie might have said, also, that most other people, where&#xD;
he called, showed an over-anxiety to impress him with the&#xD;
notion that they knew something of gentility and fashion;&#xD;

&#xD;
while many were so distressingly formal and ceremonious in&#xD;
their manner toward him, that he did not care to call a&#xD;
second time.&#xD;
Mrs. Morris, true to her first statement, insisted t1~at&#xD;
"Grandmother Brae" was constantly scheming to secure to ~&#xD;
Nell a double share of instruction in music; and, in~ the plen-&#xD;
itude of her benevolence, she determined to assist him out, of.&#xD;
the scrape." -&#xD;
"It was a shame and disgrace," she said, "that he must&#xD;
not only have that child tagging after him to singin~*sehool,&#xD;
but must also go there every other evening to give her musie&#xD;
lessons."&#xD;
The evening after she came to this determination, it hap-&#xD;
pened that Mr. Wilson sat down at home to copy some music&#xD;
for Nell. Mrs. Morris sat near him, rocking to and fro, and&#xD;
watching for an opportunity to begin her good work. At&#xD;
length, as he laid down his pen and opened his portfolio for&#xD;
another sheet of paper, she began:&#xD;
"You ought to have been at home this afternoon, Mr. Wil-&#xD;
son. I had some calls, or perhaps they were intended for you;&#xD;
one can't always tell, you know."&#xD;
"Indeed!" he replied, taking his pen again and proceeding~&#xD;
with his copy.&#xD;
"Yes," she' continued, as if determined not to be foiled,&#xD;
"~Maria Bennet and Sarah Slocum have been here half~.the&#xD;
afternoon. I inquired about your school; t their heads were-&#xD;
so full of the party John I3rae is going to give at his sugar-&#xD;
works, that they could think of nothing else. You h&amp;amp;ve heard&#xD;
all about the party, I suppose."&#xD;
"Yes, I believe so," he replied, bringing down his pen with&#xD;
a heavy staccato on the last notes of the th4rd 'bar.&#xD;

went on; "b t gir re ~irl~, though they 'don't behave n~ow&#xD;

children, and,. Ia me! look at them! They are as pert and as&#xD;
forward as if they were twenty years old. I dare say you&#xD;
have noticed them. II like to see children know their places,&#xD;
4on't you, Mr. Wilson?"&#xD;
"Certainly," said the young man, mechanically, without&#xD;
pausing from his work.&#xD;
"Ah, I knew you would agree with me, Mr. Wilson!* I&#xD;
hate pertness and forwardness above all things; but you can't&#xD;
expect much from a child whose grand-parents are constantly&#xD;
pushing her forward, and fastening her to other people, whether*&#xD;
they want her or not. There are not many who would beai&#xD;
it as you do."&#xD;
Hero Mrs. Morris was obliged to -pause, for Mr. Wilson,&#xD;
who had not attended to a word of her harangue, caught up&#xD;
his flute, and, after playing the music once or twice, took his&#xD;
hat and left the room.&#xD;
"Well, now," she said to herself, "he has gone right over&#xD;
there again! I meant to have had a little more talk with&#xD;
him,. but I have found out that it is just as I supposed. I '11&#xD;
set matters to rights to-morrow; I '11 go over there and tell&#xD;
Nelly just what he thinks of her. It will be no more than&#xD;
friendly, for she has no mother, and grandmother Brae is get-&#xD;
ting old and foolish."&#xD;
Mrs. Morris did not forget her resohition. She went over&#xD;
next day, immediately after school, and found Nelly alone.&#xD;
After some inquiries about the family, the lady's voice sud-&#xD;
denly changed from its usual loud, shrill key, to the piteous,&#xD;
disagreeable whine commonly adopted by women of her stamp&#xD;
on like occasions. Then she went on to relate her conversa-&#xD;
tion with Mr. Wilson, making, from the outset, only the&#xD;
slight mistake of imputing to him the language she l~ad used&#xD;
herself.&#xD;
At first Nell opened her clear, brown eyes, as if she did&#xD;
not understand. ]3ut as Mrs. Morris went en to say he&#xD;
called ~her pert and forward, and laughed at her grand&#xD;
&#xD;
835&#xD;
&#xD;
parents, a thousand gleaming rays seemed to converge and&#xD;
centre in the pupils of the girl's eyes, and her sudden excla-&#xD;
mation, "I don't believe it!" fairly startled that amiable&#xD;
lady.&#xD;
"I suppose not,~ my dear; people are not apt* to believe&#xD;
unpleasant things," she said; "but I heard him say it, else I&#xD;
should' hardly believe it myself. But you need n't 'take it on&#xD;
my word. Thb young folks have been talking it over this&#xD;
month past; if you don't believe me, ask them."&#xD;
On my way to singing-school that night I called on Nell.&#xD;
Instead of answering my merry greetings~ she burst into teats,&#xD;
and it was a long time before she would tell the occasion of&#xD;
her grief.&#xD;
"I do not believe it!" I said, as she closed her some-&#xD;
what disconnected account of' her interview with Mrs. ~or-&#xD;
ris. "I have heard something of this before, but I do not&#xD;
believe Mr. 'Wilson ever said or thought such things. I 'II&#xD;
ask him."&#xD;
"Not for the world, Fanny! not for the world! Mrs.&#xD;
Morris says she heard him say it, last night, and it must be&#xD;
so. You know he never would have thought of calling for&#xD;
me, if grandpa and grandma had not spoken just as they did&#xD;
about my going to singing-school. But to have him make fun&#xD;
of me, and say I kept putting myself in his way, ~t is too&#xD;
bad!" and her tears fell fast.&#xD;
I thought it was too bad, but felt there must be some mis-&#xD;
take, She refused to attend the singing-school again~ until I&#xD;
said such a course would occasion more talk, and told 'her&#xD;
that Dick and I would come for her' Very early, and that&#xD;
when there was much snow she' could spend the night with&#xD;
me. She consented to 'this arrangeim~ut, but refused to go&#xD;
that night.&#xD;
Illarry Wilson called at the usual hour. When Nell Ijeard&#xD;
his steps oi~ the threshold, she caught up a deep hood, and&#xD;

drawing it over her face, bent over a porringer of gruel that&#xD;
stood on the hearth, and began to stir it.&#xD;
"1 have brought the music II promised you, Nelly," he said,&#xD;
with a smile. "We shall~not have time to practise it till after&#xD;
~ohool, for it is almost half past si~ now. Come, get your&#xD;
bonnet and cloak."&#xD;
Nell murmured something about her grandmother's illness,&#xD;
and staying at home.&#xD;
"Why, child, you need not stay at home on that account,"&#xD;
said the old man.&#xD;
"Indeed, I think I shall not go, grandpa; I shall be wanted&#xD;
here," she said, with a firmer tone.&#xD;
"Well, I will call as I return, and we will try the music.&#xD;
To-morrow Mr. Markham and I start for H-. We shall&#xD;
be absent two or three days, and you must have the air per-&#xD;
fect when I return. But pray don't stir the bottom of that&#xD;
dish out while I am gone," said Mr. Wilson, laughing, as he&#xD;
closed the door.&#xD;
Long before he returned, Nell went to her chamber. She&#xD;
was grieved, wounded, bewildered. She could not under-&#xD;
stand such baseness, and she laid her head on her pillow&#xD;
that night with feelings to which she had hithei~to been a&#xD;
stranger.&#xD;
Harry Wilson and Mr. Markham returned late on Saturday&#xD;
night. The next evening, on his way to singing-school, he&#xD;
called, as usual, fore Nelly. But she and I were already at&#xD;
the school-house. He was disappointed and disturbed. Some-&#xD;
how his short absence had made him feel, more deeply than&#xD;
ever, that to see and speak with Nelly was necessary to his&#xD;
happiness. And he would see her, he thought, as he returned.&#xD;
But no; Nelly had obtained permission to spend the night&#xD;
with me, and before most of our companions had arranged&#xD;
their hoods and cloaks we were half way home.&#xD;
That night Mr. Wilson was in no mood to listen to the&#xD;
endless gossip of Mrs. Morris. He was angry with himself;&#xD;

with Nell, and not particularly pleased with the world in&#xD;
general.&#xD;
"She is too flighty, too thoughtless," he said to himself.&#xD;
"I have seen too much of the world for such childishness to&#xD;
trouble me." His knowledge of the world had been such as&#xD;
to make him morbidly sensitive in all that related to the affec-&#xD;
tions. Many a fair face had caught his fancy; but it was&#xD;
really true thatnone had touched his heart like little Nelly&#xD;
Brae's. He now began to see that he unconsciously treasured&#xD;
up every graceful movement and winning smile, and made them&#xD;
the food of his dreams. He was startled at the strength srnd&#xD;
depth of his feelings. What did Nelly mean? Why did she&#xD;
avoid him? What did he mean himself?&#xD;

It was early in the sugar season, and tTohn Brae had given&#xD;
out invitations for a party at his shanty, on the first pleasant&#xD;
evening of the full moon. This happened the next evening.&#xD;
Nelly and I spent the afternoon at the "sap-works," assisting&#xD;
John in his arrangements. His shanty was a building some&#xD;
fifteen feet square, rudely constructed of posts A zough&#xD;
boards. John had devised an addition, of which the two old&#xD;
maples in front were to be the corner posts. Branches of&#xD;
cedar and hemlock served for clapboards and thatch. 1Wo&#xD;
wreathed the bare walls of the main building with everg~ee~ ;~&#xD;

and the great half-hogshead tub in the corner, covered over&#xD;
with clean, white boards, served for a side-table, on which we&#xD;
placed sundry dishes of butternuts, walnut~ and apples. A&#xD;
large covered-basket stood in the centre, containing bread,&#xD;
butter, salt, and, several dozens of fresh eggs, which usually&#xD;
formed the chief article of refreshment on such occasions.&#xD;
The last seat was arranged, the rude floors nicely swept,&#xD;
and, having nothing more to do, we paused to survey our&#xD;
wor'k.&#xD;
"It is really a very pretty place," said L&#xD;
"Pretty enough," Nell replied, sadly.&#xD;
~ "Pretty enough!" II exclaimed, rather vexed at her scant&#xD;
praise. "lit is beautiful! If it could be well lighted, it&#xD;
would look about a~well as the church on Christmas eve."&#xD;
"Sure enough," said John, coming up.~ "Can't you contrive&#xD;
to have it well lighted up, girls?"&#xD;
"We have candles enough, but we have only eight sticks,&#xD;
for grandmother will not let us have her plated ones.&#xD;
"Wait a bit, girls. I '11 fix it," he said, opening a box&#xD;
that served as a kind of tool-chest; and presently, by means&#xD;
of augers and pine blocks, he provided a great supply of&#xD;
candlesticks.&#xD;
Our arrangements all finished, we went home to get tea, and&#xD;
dress for the evening9 Nell would gladly have remained at&#xD;
home, but she kiiew that her absence would excite surprise and&#xD;
conjecture. Besides, she had been the chief influence in per-&#xD;
suaditig John to give the pa~rty.&#xD;
When we reached our woodland bower, the beams of the&#xD;
rising moon~ 'were around the leafy door-way, struggling to&#xD;
steam and sleep on the floor, as longingly as if it had been&#xD;
of Paria~n marble; and~a few stars looked down through the&#xD;
openings in the hemlock thatch, like guardian spirits. Our&#xD;
candlesticks did well, and the effect of the 'light was fine,&#xD;
though here and there a bunch of hemlock leaves crisped and&#xD;
~aekled as they came in ceita~t with the blazing Wiek~. The&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
night was beautiful. The atmosphere was so clear and elas-&#xD;
tic, that we could hear the voices and footsteps of our guests&#xD;
coming across the fields long before they. reached the ~shanty.&#xD;
Ah! those were happy hours; as happy as yo~ith, health&#xD;
and unworn hearts could make them. I will not pretend to&#xD;
say how many games of forfeit were played; nor how many&#xD;
of the forfeits were kisses; nor how often the long, spiral&#xD;
apple-peelin~s, when dropped over the right shoulder, formed&#xD;
the very letters which, by all the laws of magic, they were&#xD;
bound to form; nor with what a half-pleased, half-coquettish&#xD;
air the maidens held forth their palms full of apple-seeds,&#xD;
while John, Fred, or Sam, or whoever had "Darned the&#xD;
apples," counted them over and over, to see if they w~nld&#xD;
spell the given name; nor how, if he succeeded, they were&#xD;
thrown into his bosom with a toss of the head, and, "I won-&#xD;
der how any one can be so ridiculous!"&#xD;
Apples! 0, blessed be apples! they have been famed in&#xD;
philosophy and song; but neither the golden ones of idaliun&#xD;
Aphrodite, nor the famous one of Sir Jisaac Newton, ever pos-&#xD;
sessed such delightful magic as the Rhode Island greetingss&#xD;
that made part of our entertainment that evening at John&#xD;
Brae's sap-house.&#xD;
The whole arcana of magic lay hid in their seeds, if one&#xD;
only possessed the skill to interpret them, and Nelly was&#xD;
deeply versed in all such lore. At our gatherings she was&#xD;
the acknowledged sibyl. But she was too busy now ~rran~-&#xD;
ing the table, and discussing with John and a merry-p~4 old&#xD;
bachelor the precise number of minutes nece~ary to boa an&#xD;

At length Mary Qrant came into the back room, an&#xD;

"Nonsense, Mary! I can't go; II am busy."&#xD;
"You had better come, Nelly," she said, significantly;&#xD;
then, lowering her voice to a whisper, she added, "some of&#xD;
them say you would not be so sober and old-womanish if' some-&#xD;
body they could name were here."&#xD;
Nell colored deeply, and, yielding to Mary's movement,&#xD;
passed into the green-room. Here she became the centre of'&#xD;
the company, and, Mary having stealthily put a wreath of&#xD;
holly-leaves around her head, she sat with comic gravity&#xD;
uttering predictions that were received with shouts of' laugh-&#xD;
ter, when suddenly the rude door opened, and Harry Wilson&#xD;
entered. He was received with a loud welcome, and imme-&#xD;
diately drawn into the circle.&#xD;
Until within a few~days Nell had poured forth her thoughts&#xD;
and feelings with the unconstrained freedom of a bird. But&#xD;
she was now learning to act the woman, with the owlish world&#xD;
for a tutor, and of' course her first lesson was concealment.&#xD;
She pressed down her rising heart, and, taking advantage of&#xD;
her assumed character, she bowed gravely to Mr. Wilson and&#xD;
went on with her predictions. Presently she arose, and,&#xD;
placing the wreath on Mary's head, said, "There, good folk,&#xD;
I can stay no longer; I must away."&#xD;
~' No, no! you have not told Mr. Wilson's fortune yet.&#xD;
You cannot go yet!" cried three or four, pressing round to&#xD;
prevent her escape.&#xD;
"Indeed, I must go; there, John is calling me now; do&#xD;
let m~ go!" she exclaimed hastily, as if' afraid to trust her&#xD;
voice~&#xD;
Mr. Wilson himself' made way for her to pass, saying, as he&#xD;
did so, "No, no, good friends. It is. unwise to attempt to&#xD;
compel fate. I fear my fortune would be a dark one if' told&#xD;
by an unwilling sibyl."&#xD;
A merrier set than was gathered round our table that night&#xD;
could not be found in old Connecticut. Mr. Wilson, as our&#xD;
most distinguished guest, was seated by Nell at the head ~f'&#xD;

the table. But no words passed between them, save such as&#xD;
were absolutely necessary. We kept primitive hours, and at&#xD;
ten o'clock there was a general call for hoods and cloaks.&#xD;
Amid the confusion, and "more last words," Mr. Wilson ap-&#xD;
proached Nell, who stood by the table searching a great&#xD;
basket as if she expected to find happiness at the bottom, and&#xD;
proposed to escort her home. He did not catch her reply, fQr&#xD;
at that moment half' a dozen gathered round him to inquire&#xD;
about the approaching concert. When he turned to offer hi~&#xD;
arm she was gone.&#xD;
He mingled with the group around the door, but she was&#xD;
not there, Vexed and wounded by her strange conduct, he&#xD;
took the more frequented path home, but he had not pro-&#xD;
ceeded far before he caught a glimpse of her form moving&#xD;
rapidly along the path that led round by the old maple. He&#xD;
paused and hesitated. He knew she could not cross the&#xD;
stream on the stepping-stones, for he had tried it that even-&#xD;
ing. The, late rains had made the crossing so difficult that he&#xD;
had been obliged to turn back and take the other path.&#xD;
The next moment he was following her with rapid steps.&#xD;
Before he reached the crossing-place, he left the path and&#xD;
sprang across the stream, some rods higher up. In her haste&#xD;
she had proceeded about one third of' the way across, before&#xD;
she saw that the stones in the middle of the stream were&#xD;
completely out of sight. She stood hesitating, when he sud-&#xD;
denly appeared, caught her in his arms, and bore her across&#xD;
without speaking. She gazed at him a moment in astonish-&#xD;
ment, but, as he turned to leave her, she burst into tears, lie&#xD;
paused, and, turning back, asked eagerly:&#xD;
"What does all this mean, Nelly 't"&#xD;
She could not reply, for tears. He stood a moment .irre~L&#xD;
olute, and then led her on to the old maple.&#xD;
"Will you not tell me what it means?" he asked again.&#xD;
She made an 'effort to stifle her sobs, and, looking up through&#xD;
her tears, said, "I suppose it was nOt quite proper for ~ie to&#xD;

say what grandfather did. But he did not mean anything im-&#xD;
proper. I was foolish to go, - but I did not think y~u could&#xD;
be so unkind, so cruel, Harry~"&#xD;
"But what have I done, Nell?"&#xD;
"Perhaps you did ~iot mean it just as Mrs. Morris makes&#xD;
it seem; but to think you could talk so of me!" and she&#xD;
sobbed again more deeply than before.&#xD;
"Hush, hush, Nelly! Do explain yourself; what have I&#xD;
said to Mrs. Morris?"&#xD;
By degrees he drew from her an account' of her interview&#xD;
with Mrs. Morris. We need not say how eagerly and indig-&#xD;
nantly he exculpated himself; nor what earnest and~beautiful&#xD;
words he whispered, as he drew her closer and closer to his&#xD;
bosom. Memory, or the prophetic yearnings of your own&#xD;
heart, will tell you what they were. I will only say that the~&#xD;
lazy sap in the old tree took a livelier motion; and ever&#xD;
afterwards troops* of sweet flowers, such as the anemone and&#xD;
meok-eyed arbutus, came yearly to dwell at its foot, and bless&#xD;
it with their fragrant beauty.&#xD;

"And is that all, 13'anny?" asks E-, with a look of&#xD;
disappointment not very flattering to my story-telling talent.&#xD;
"Ay, that is all, and enough too. Did I not tell you the&#xD;
story was like the old maple?"&#xD;
"J~ut, Fanny, it is no story at all. You have not said a&#xD;
word about the wedding; we do not even know they were&#xD;
married."&#xD;
"0, if you wish to hear about a wedding, take up the&#xD;
newspaper yonder. There is an account of the. Empress&#xD;
Eugenie's. These romances in white satin are wearisomely&#xD;
a1ik~. Th1t I will add, that some four years ago I visited&#xD;
Nell at her pleasant home on the banks of the Quinebaug. I&#xD;
found them both unchanged in heart; but she had really&#xD;
grown beautiful. Her face had gained in tone and express~&#xD;

heart brimming with untold happiness,~and her voice was, as&#xD;
ever, 'the sweetest midst the cadences of girls.'&#xD;
"We sat in the parlor, calling up old times. As I looked&#xD;
from the open window, I saw that one of the pillars of the&#xD;
piazza was wreathed with ivy, and near by, under the shade&#xD;
of a rose-bush, grew a large bunch of sage.&#xD;
"'So you really planted them, Nelly ! - the sage and ivy&#xD;
I mean,' I said, pointing toward them.&#xD;
"'To be sure she did,' replied Harry, laughing; 'and they~&#xD;
thrive well. Come and see the fruit, Fam~y.'&#xD;
"He drew us both into the next room, and, putting aside a&#xD;
muslin curtain, pointed to a beautiful babe that lay asleep in&#xD;
its cradle.&#xD;
"The young mother stooped to kiss it, and as she raised her&#xD;
head their eyes met. Ah! that glance, so fulV of unspeakable&#xD;
happiness! I involuntarily repeated those words of the dis~&#xD;

LILIAN LOVIS.&#xD;
"SIXTY-ONE two - three. It must be old Aunt Saun-&#xD;
ders," I observed, as the tolling of the old church bell fell&#xD;
upon my ear. For the first time in my life I listened to its&#xD;
mournful tones with a feeling of relief, if not pleasure. Not&#xD;
that I have so far outgrown humanity as to be able to look&#xD;
Death in the face without fear, for I have still a childish&#xD;
dread of shadows, - but I knew that a lamp, whose flame&#xD;
had been long dimmed by the unwholesome vapors of earth,&#xD;
had been relit in heaven - that a harp, whose chords had&#xD;
been too tensely drawn while here to give forth sweet music,&#xD;
had again caught up the hymn of life in that blessed land&#xD;
where all beautiful things&#xD;
"Keep the high promise of their earlier day."&#xD;
I put on my bonnet, and in a few moments stood in the&#xD;
chamber of death. I have ever had a proclivity to antiqua-&#xD;
rianism, reader; but my researches have been rather in the&#xD;
soul-world than in the world of old ruins or Roman antique&#xD;
ties. I love to take some old, careworn, world-worn face,&#xD;
and recast it in the mould of youth to strip from it, one&#xD;
by one, those mummy-like envelopes which time, education&#xD;
dnd custom have wrapped around it, until, Galatea-like, it&#xD;
stands before me, glowing with youth, hope and beauty. ~But&#xD;
Aunt Saunders' face (she was the "village aunt," reader);&#xD;
had ever been to me most tantalizing. Occasionally Ifancied&#xD;
that I could detect a gleam of light in her sunken eyes, that&#xD;
betokened something like human interest ~ but, like a spot&#xD;

of untarnished gilding on some old, illuminated manuscript, it&#xD;
only served to show more plair~ly the dilapidated condition&#xD;
of the rest.&#xD;
How could T dream that she had ever been young and fair?&#xD;
that those faded, sunken eyes had ever flashed back the sun-&#xD;
light, or mirrored in their depths an image of love and hope?&#xD;
that those shriveled lids had ever drooped, in very bashful-&#xD;
ness, beneath the gaze of loving eyes which were earnestly&#xD;
striving to read that tale which no man reads unmoved? By&#xD;
what magic could I smooth out the unnumbered wrinkles that&#xD;
circled round her mouth, and make it once more the gate of&#xD;
love and mirth, of song and ringing laughter?&#xD;
Death revealed to me far more than life. He did not enter&#xD;
that solitary chamber alone. The angel of mercy had stood&#xD;
by the pillow of the dying one, and retouched those faded&#xD;
lineaments with something~lik~ the freshness of early life.&#xD;
Then I learned (and coi~ld well credit the tale) how, in&#xD;
early girlhood, she had been, for three blessed years, the&#xD;
cherished flower of young Henry Gr~sham's heart -his Lily,&#xD;
as he fondly called her, filling his pathway with fragrance&#xD;
and beauty. Those sunken eyes had returned light for light,&#xD;
those shriveled lips, love for love, and the young x~ian forgot&#xD;
his proud mother and worldly-wise father, while he sat by her&#xD;
side and received both at her hands. Lilian Lovis had&#xD;
nothing to recommend her to the wealthy Greshams but her&#xD;
sweet face and guileless heart. These were priceless in the&#xD;
eyes of young Harry; but, unfortunately, the old people&#xD;
thought differently. They saw no beauty save through the&#xD;
yellow atmosphere of gold, no worth save such as could be&#xD;
found between the leaves of niouldy family records. Their&#xD;
children had been trained to implicit obedience, axid they did&#xD;
not fail to represent to Harry their disapproval of his taste&#xD;
in such a way as to leave him no choice between love and&#xD;
what they called - and, alas! he thought duty.&#xD;
They succeeded in convincing his intellect, but not hi~&#xD;

heart, for there the fragrance of his Lily lingered long after&#xD;
the daughter of rich Jacob Greene called him husband. And&#xD;
once or twice, during the first years of his marriage (we say it&#xD;
in a whisper, reader), he was so very foolish as to entertain&#xD;
something like the thought that Manning Farm and Long&#xD;
Acres were a poor exchange for the pure soul and loving tones&#xD;
of Lilian Lovis. But he was prudent as well as dutiful, and,&#xD;
in a few years, succeeded, to all appearance, in burying the&#xD;
image of his youth, together with that of his meek-eyed Lily,&#xD;
'under a load of speculations that finally made him one of the&#xD;
richest men in the county.&#xD;
For some time after Harry Gresham's marriage, Lilian&#xD;
Lovis' eyes had a dreamy look, and, not infrequently, a&#xD;
bright drop gathered on the long lashes, and fell silently&#xD;
down her cheek. Still she did not repine. She had been too&#xD;
deeply schooled in 'the "meek lessons of humanity" to do&#xD;
that. Harry had ~obeyed hi~ parents fulfilled the com-&#xD;
mandment - and, with her New England education, she could&#xD;
not blame him. With an earnest effort t~ gather the sun~&#xD;
shine into her heart once ~more, she lifted her head, and sought&#xD;
strength and comfort in the strict performance of such duties&#xD;
as' fell to her lot.&#xD;
Lily was still young when her mother died, but she had a&#xD;
high character for faithfulness and honesty, and this drew&#xD;
upon her the attention of old, rich, rheumatic John Saunders.&#xD;
He wanted a wife, or, rather, a nurse and housekeeper under&#xD;
that name, and his choice fell upon Lily.&#xD;
She' hesitated - but friends w~iispered, nay shouted, max-&#xD;
ims of~ prudence and worldly wisdom in her ears, mingled&#xD;
with hints of dependence, until, bewildered, confused, with a&#xD;
shudder which she prayed Heaven to forgive, as the move-&#xD;
ment of a rebellious heart, she laid her hand in the bony one&#xD;
that reached out to grasp hers, and gave him the name of&#xD;
husband.&#xD;

empty, - but "something the hea~j~ n~ust have to cherish,"&#xD;
and, as her husband grew more and niore feeble, pity took the&#xD;
place of love, and led her to think of him with ~. feeling nearly&#xD;
akin to that which a mother feels towards a peevish, suffering&#xD;
child. Irritable and impatient, he could not bear to trust her&#xD;
from his sight; and the freshness and fragrance of Lily soon&#xD;
faded in the close atmosphere of that sick-chamber, while the&#xD;
flower-dust of the heart was daily brushed away by some new&#xD;
exaction on the part of the querulous invalid. Yet he loved&#xD;
her, as well as he was capable of loving anything aside from&#xD;
himself, and thought he made ample compensation~for all her&#xD;
care and patience by leaving her a competence in his will.&#xD;
So thought her friends when, after a lingering struggle of&#xD;
many years, he at length yielded to death~ They spoke much&#xD;
of his generosity, and Lilian assented to their remarks with-&#xD;
out comprehending them.&#xD;
Afl~er. so many years of seclusion their voices annoyed her.&#xD;
She had not loved old John Saunders as a wife she could&#xD;
not; but his pale, wrinkled face, peering over the back of his&#xD;
arm-chair, watching her every movement -~ his sharp, queru~&#xD;
bus tones, calling her name until he obt~dned a reply, were it&#xD;
a thousand times, had, by the mere force of habit, become a&#xD;
part of her daily life, of herself..-~- and now, in her utter iso~&#xD;
nation, she often turned from the condolence that sounded so&#xD;
much like congratulation, towards that old arm-chair, almost&#xD;
expecting, and half wishing, to hear again his sharp-toned&#xD;
"Lilian." Her long confinement had unfitted her for the&#xD;
rush and stir of life; but ~he gradually grew to be~n ora~ls'&#xD;
at births and deaths - a rare compounded of embrocations&#xD;
and syrups, and nurse to the, whole town. To these she&#xD;
united another occupation that of shroud~maker; and many&#xD;
a time have II watched her attenuated fingers pressing the&#xD;
long needle through the starched muslin, and thought, if the&#xD;
white folds were only gathered aroutid her, the illusion would&#xD;
be complete. Lifi~ and death, a funeral or a birth, seemed.&#xD;

alike to her; and, to me, ~1ie was a being without human sym~&#xD;

*     life still vibrated to the music of earth. On the day before&#xD;
her death the rich Judge Gresham, while presiding at a meet~&#xD;
f&#xD;
ing of the dWectors of the railroad, was taken with a fit&#xD;
of apoplexy. He lived but a few hours, but, during that&#xD;
time, succeeded in making a few orders and requests under-&#xD;
stood. AOne was, that ]i4lian Saunders should make his&#xD;
shroud. The person who conveyed the order to Aunt Saun..&#xD;
ders did not note the trembling of her hands, or the sudden&#xD;
gleam of her eye, as he mentioned the death of her early&#xD;
lover and his request. For some seconds after the door&#xD;
closed upon the ulessenger, she stood gazing at the snowy&#xD;
folds of cambric in her hand, as in a dream. "'T is more&#xD;
than forty years since," she murmured, as she mechanically&#xD;
laid the cambric on her pillow, and pressed her cheek against&#xD;
the white folds. For a few moments, perchance h~ui~s~ she&#xD;
was again hi~ Lily, and then - Death 'and Niercy took her&#xD;
