changes which, have come over its anti-&#xD;
quated walls-many have been its occu-&#xD;

bauchery and crime, which might be&#xD;
narrated as connected with its 'former&#xD;
uses and history.&#xD;
At the time a~ which we date the com-&#xD;
mencement of our story, the house stood&#xD;
alone in a garden, so thickly planted&#xD;
with tre~s that it could scarcely be dis-&#xD;
cerned from the 'old Albany road, which&#xD;
passed within ft few yards of the spot.&#xD;
Here anil there, in the neighborhood,&#xD;
were' a number of Dutch and Kriicker-&#xD;
bucker farm houses, with the cottages of&#xD;
the humbler gardener, and others who&#xD;
preferred to reside in the environs instead&#xD;
of the growing and crowded city. All&#xD;
of these tenement~however, were at such&#xD;
a distance from the old mansion, to render&#xD;
it almost entirely free from intrusiga by&#xD;
any of the simple-minded people located&#xD;
in the approximate neighborhood.&#xD;
After the death of the original Knick-&#xD;
erbocker owner, the house was occupied&#xD;
for a time by a notorious individual, who&#xD;

with the object of the assemblage, inclu-&#xD;

der.&#xD;
Adjoining this room was a smaller pne&#xD;
in which were placed a number of card&#xD;
tables, nearly all of which were occupied&#xD;
by groups of men intently engaged at&#xD;
gambling with cards. One of these&#xD;
groups was composed of three individu-&#xD;
als, of whose personal appearance and&#xD;
other characteristics we will attempt to&#xD;
give a faint description. The first, or&#xD;
eldest apparently of the trio, we shall call&#xD;
Dubois. He wa~ full fifty years of age&#xD;
-of rather prepossessing appearance at&#xD;
the first hluah of an introduction, but&#xD;
whom few would select as a subsequent&#xD;
companion or associate. His eyes were&#xD;
small and resless; there was a curl of&#xD;
his upper lip which seemed to imply scorn&#xD;
or contempt cf his fellow man, while ~the&#xD;
expression of his countenance was sinis-&#xD;
ter-nay, quite repulsive, overshadowed&#xD;
as it was by large brows, the hair of which&#xD;
protruded out straight fully an inch from&#xD;
his forehead. Like the hair of his head'&#xD;
the brows were of a dark iron grey, al-&#xD;
though his i'hiskers and moustaches were&#xD;
as dark as the color of the raven's wing.&#xD;
His nose was very long and bent, resem-&#xD;
bling very much the beak of a bird of&#xD;
preys lie was quite stout and burly, and&#xD;
was now dressed in the extreme of fash-&#xD;
ion, displaying considerable~ jewelry about&#xD;
his person, such as a gold watch, a dia-&#xD;
mend pin in his ruffled shirt, and nume-&#xD;
rous rings en his angers. He woull at&#xD;
thepresent day, be la~en for a sea-faring&#xD;
man--the captain of ~in East India trader,&#xD;

or rather perhaps a freebooter oi~ bucca-&#xD;
neer. I~one however could have gu ssed&#xD;
of what country he was a native-whether&#xD;
of France, Spain or Germany. He spoke&#xD;
fluently in Euglish, but seemed to prefer&#xD;
French; in which language his tongue ran&#xD;
with sufficient volubility, while there was&#xD;
no lack of that peculiar twang, gesticula-&#xD;
tion, shrug of the shoulder, and what&#xD;
not, which are some of the charac~eristjcs&#xD;
of the volatile people of France.&#xD;
The next individual was probably thirty&#xD;
years of age, of somewhat spare figure,&#xD;
and rather under med~im height. His&#xD;
features were icaular and nearly in strict&#xD;
accordance with classic models. His eye'&#xD;
was keenly dark and flashing, yet his&#xD;
manner was graceful and easy, which&#xD;
seemed to contradict tie impetuosity of&#xD;
character usually denoted by that deserip-&#xD;
lion of the soul's light houses. His hair,&#xD;
whiskers arid moustache, a1so were very&#xD;
black. His dress. though of rich fabije,&#xD;
was quite plain and unostentatious. He&#xD;
was called Trevalyan.&#xD;
The last of, the group was quite a young&#xD;
man, whose age s4med to be of that in-&#xD;
definite character, ranging from twenty to&#xD;
~wenty-threc---not exactly a youth, 'yet&#xD;
scarcely a full developed man. He was&#xD;
handsome, gaily dressed, and possessed&#xD;
that brusque manner quite common among&#xD;
persons early in life thrown upon their&#xD;
own resources foa an establishment in so-&#xD;
ciety. There was an air of confidence&#xD;
about him, bordering qa the impudent~&#xD;
hut such as~ rather pleased th~n offended&#xD;
those with whom he associated or came&#xD;
in promiscuells contact. He was' frank&#xD;
and sociable, but with a judgment so cool&#xD;
and steady, that none but a practice ob-&#xD;

MINNY LAWSON, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
It was only last week that I l~ad to pay a&#xD;
good sum of money to break his inden-&#xD;
tures with old Mr. Somers, the black-&#xD;
smith. I'm sure I don't know what will&#xD;
be the end of all his foolish ravings. Since&#xD;
the strange craft has been seen in our&#xD;
waters, be hastalked of nothing but pni-&#xD;
~ateering and the like. Indeed, I shouldn't&#xD;
be surprised if he took to sen-faring alter&#xD;
all."&#xD;
"Well, why not let ~im go to sea?&#xD;
Who knows but. he might become the&#xD;
commander of an East Indiaman by-and-&#xD;
by! There, see how fondly, his sister&#xD;
welcomes him. Ali, Mr. Lawson, while&#xD;
you have such a daughter, you should&#xD;
have no fears for George. I'll be bound&#xD;
he'll make his way through the world, and&#xD;
prove an honor and a blessing to his pa-&#xD;
rents yet."&#xD;
"Ho, there George !-George I say !"&#xD;
~ "Coming, father, as soon as I can fasten'&#xD;
&#xD;
"Certainly not. lam always glad to&#xD;
have you doing anything useful, whether&#xD;
it be for yourself or your friends."&#xD;
am much obliged to you George~for&#xD;
your kindness, but I won't take the money.&#xD;
You have earned it, and shall keep it, my&#xD;

with all my~ heart, and bring the strangers&#xD;
back to the city again, if you will George.&#xD;
I shall be engaged~i day down at White-&#xD;

stay about here, if you are disinclined to&#xD;
finish your job for the gentlemen, my&#xD;

No, George don't wan't the money,"&#xD;
said Mr. Lawson; but he shall remain&#xD;
and wait any chance customer that may&#xD;
require your services, friend Switzer."&#xD;
"Certainly father, with all my heart as&#xD;
I have already said. i'm very fond of&#xD;
boating and the water. and should like to&#xD;

THE OUTLAWS' LEAGUE.&#xD;
&#xD;
laptuous development in her form that al~&#xD;
ready betokened The full ripeness and&#xD;
,glory of young womanhood. Her auburn&#xD;
hair was plaited neatly over her smooth&#xD;
forehead, and tI~sen so arranged to fall in&#xD;
ringlets over as finely a shaped head as&#xD;
ever graced a human shoulder, to her&#xD;
snowy neck, forming a contrast between&#xD;
the dazzling skin and the sunny hair, that&#xD;
might well captivate the eye and awaken&#xD;
intense passion in the most stoical of ho-&#xD;
s~ms. He:'s was a beauty such as&#xD;
"Guido would have loved to dwell upon;"&#xD;
but as we are not au fail in describing&#xD;
the comparative qualities of woman's&#xD;
charms, we shall leave the reader to draw&#xD;
upon his own imagination for every attn-&#xD;
b ute of sweetness and grace, and yield&#xD;
them all as the legitimate concomitants of&#xD;
the remarkable loveliness of Miuny Law-&#xD;
son.&#xD;
"Now, Georgetell me who were the&#xD;
gentlemen you took in the boat to Wee-&#xD;
hawke4rt-,rwere the citizens or stran-&#xD;
~'hey are strangers to me; at least, I&#xD;
rsaw either of them befoe, but they&#xD;
evidently familiar ~vith'dhe city and&#xD;
be localities of the n~ighboi~hood. 5o I&#xD;
judged fiom their conversation with each&#xD;
other, but as they only rtddressed me in&#xD;
regard to taking them across the river and&#xD;
back, I can't say a great deal about them.&#xD;
-They said they were going to stop at&#xD;
~one of the cottages at the base .of the hill,&#xD;
but I did not consider it my business to&#xD;
enquirer at which. Yet I hardly think&#xD;
they belong to the city, becarfte they&#xD;
didn't talk like ourpeople doin matters&#xD;
and things iu general. I will probably&#xD;
know something more about them this&#xD;
evening. Their liberality in giving me&#xD;
a gold cm, for the trifling service required&#xD;
of me, would make me say they were&#xD;
not citizens of New York. Perhaps they&#xD;
&#xD;
were some of the people of the strange&#xD;
craft that appeared in the Bay a f~w days&#xD;
ago."&#xD;
"Fiddlesticks! You're always think-&#xD;
ing of the suspicious schooner-that ves-&#xD;
sel has not been seen for ten days past.&#xD;
It isn't likely, I should think, that these&#xD;
young fellows you rowed over belonged to&#xD;
that vessel. You will, however, probably&#xD;
know more about the matter to-night.----&#xD;
Thete, George, go now to Switzer's boatr&#xD;
as you promised, while I cut some fresh&#xD;
roses for Minny to take to the market."~ ~A&#xD;
Georg~ started off towards the river, and&#xD;
his father began to cull the rarest and&#xD;
freshest of his floral glories~in the rear of&#xD;
the cottage.&#xD;
In less than half an 'hour thereafter,&#xD;
Minny Lawson was seen on her way with&#xD;
a basket of flowers to one of the markets&#xD;
in the heart of the city, which it was her&#xD;
regular practice to attend, and where she&#xD;
always met with ready sales and the high-&#xD;
est pi ices for her sweet bouquets.&#xD;
That day passed away-.-night came,&#xD;
hut Minny did not return to give to her&#xD;
father the proceeds of the sale of the flow-&#xD;
ers, to cheer the heart of tier dear mother,&#xD;
and to make the cottage pleasant with&#xD;
the musical tones ol her voice, and the&#xD;
natural joyousness of h~r nattire.&#xD;
The ncxt day. passed-another- the&#xD;
fourth day-a week; and the fair, sweet&#xD;
young girl continued away from the home&#xD;
of her childhood and parental love.&#xD;
Where had she departed? What was&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
THE SERPENT IN TIlE OJIASS.&#xD;
Gannawicu street, twenty-five years&#xD;
ago, presented a widely different aspect&#xD;

10                MINNY LAWSON.                                   THE OUTLAWS' LEAGUE.           Ii&#xD;
&#xD;
' from its appearance at the present day&#xD;
It was then the most fashionable and aris&#xD;
tocratie portion of the city. The jwel-&#xD;
ings, for the n~ost part, were mansion&#xD;
like, large and comfortably arranged, th&#xD;
abodes at once of the more opulent anc&#xD;
influential among the merchants and othei&#xD;
citizens of the Island of Ma~ihattan o&#xD;
that period. The street itself partook 0:&#xD;
a s-,~s in urbe character, planted as it was&#xD;
with numerous trees, whcse thick greer&#xD;
foliage screened the c~tizen'or passer-by&#xD;
from the scorching sun of the summer&#xD;
solstice, and relieved refreshiflgly the&#xD;
fiery glare of the red painted walls of the&#xD;
houses, formerly so characteristic of the&#xD;
whim or taste of our staid and sturdy&#xD;
Knickerbocker people. Here nod there&#xD;
indeed, Were tenements of less humble&#xD;
de cription, occupied by the mechanic&#xD;
and artisan, interspersed with shops aid&#xD;
stores, concomitant of the general wants&#xD;
of the inhabitants of the neighborhood.&#xD;
The whole aspect of the scene however,&#xD;
was one of quiet ease and comfort, hav-&#xD;
ing little of the glare and pomp of the&#xD;
great city, but rather all the pleasant and&#xD;
wholesome associations of a first class&#xD;
country town. The close vicinity of the&#xD;
Battery, too, added to the desirableness of&#xD;
a residence iii that section of the city.&#xD;
Here it was the wont of the grey-hair-&#xD;
ed people to repair, and beneath the urn-&#xD;
brageous f~iloge of the large and noble&#xD;
sycamore of the Park, to smoke their&#xD;
pipes and discourse of afikirs connected&#xD;
with the social and political relations of&#xD;
their own fireside~ and the ~vorld at large.&#xD;
The Bittery, also, in those days was the&#xD;
play-ground of childhood, who gambolled&#xD;
over the green sward, and gathered dan-&#xD;
delion blossoms~-those bright golden&#xD;
doubloons of early spring-or pursued&#xD;
the gemmed-winged butterfly 4s, as they&#xD;
danced some fantastic polka, e~sch with its&#xD;
&#xD;
sweetheart, over the emerald carpet which&#xD;
- Nature had spread around, as if purposely&#xD;
* for the revelry of those short-lived crea-&#xD;
- tures of the balmy air. It was indeed a&#xD;
gorgeous scene, when the sparliling Wa-&#xD;
I ters of the Hudson and the bay became&#xD;
illumined in the g'tare of the setting sun&#xD;
C giving it the appearance of a sea of fire&#xD;
C and gold, into which were thrown every&#xD;
pearl, and rdby, and precious gem, gath-&#xD;
ered from the Inds and all the teeming&#xD;
mines of the world. Then, again, this&#xD;
scene would be exchanged to another al-&#xD;
beit less dazzling, but scarcely less beau-&#xD;
tiful and sublime-to a season, in sooth,&#xD;
* when the full round moon threw down&#xD;
its radiance over the expanse of the wa-&#xD;
ters, nud enshrouded all creation, as it&#xD;
were, with a mantle of silver tissue, the&#xD;
same seeminely, richly g~mmed with&#xD;
sparkles of gold, as the imagination riuight&#xD;
reatlily fancy the lightning-like flashes of&#xD;
the fire-flies to he, as seen beneath the&#xD;
barkerr shade&amp;amp;of the trees, at such~ times&#xD;
as those tiny insects were wont to hold&#xD;
high carnival, regardless of their noisy&#xD;
nocturnall brethren of another genus, wlt&amp;amp;/&#xD;
disputed, and denied, and affirmed t&#xD;
~Katy~didC a~d "Katy-didn't," in the ct~&#xD;
ert recesses of the surrounding shrubberyi&#xD;
and grass. We say such was the aspect&#xD;
and some of the associations connected&#xD;
with a residence in Greenwich street,&#xD;
scarcely a quarter of a century ago. But&#xD;
how have all these things changed I The&#xD;
Battery itself has become comparatively&#xD;
(leserted of the presence of the more re-&#xD;
spectable and worthy of our people, and&#xD;
is now almost wholly given up to vagrants&#xD;
and 'small thieves--.--the thimble-rigger,&#xD;
pocket-book dropper, and others, who&#xD;
prey upon and rob and swindle the stran-.&#xD;
ger and countryman when t'ey can allure&#xD;
them into their villanous meshes, as they&#xD;
land at the wharves of our city from the&#xD;
&#xD;
many hundred steamers and packet-ships&#xD;
that daily arrive from all parts of the&#xD;
Uniteil States and the world. Green-&#xD;
wich street, too, is sally changed, being&#xD;
almost solely devoted to trade and traffic&#xD;
'of every kind. The ancient Knicker-&#xD;
bocker mansions have all been converted&#xD;
either into mercantile and shipping ware-&#xD;
rooms, or German -Emigrant Boarding&#xD;
houses. The street, in fact, is now daily&#xD;
thronged ~vith newly arrived emigrants,&#xD;
whose peculiar costume and outlandish&#xD;
dialect would naturAlly lead a stranger&#xD;
traversing that part of the city to suppose&#xD;
he ~vas in the midst of a populous Euro-&#xD;
pean town, instead of in a section of our&#xD;
American luetropolis.&#xD;
But it is not of these changes we have&#xD;
at present to write. We revert, accord-&#xD;
ingly, to matters more directly pertinent&#xD;
to our narrative. We have already inti-&#xD;
mated that Gree~svich street, in the&#xD;
neighborhood of the Battery, was a few&#xD;
years since, among the most aristocratic&#xD;
and fashionable sections of the city; and&#xD;
that the general aspect of the dwellings&#xD;
~t of opulence and ea~e, without&#xD;
litter and ostentation displayed by&#xD;
inbabita~t4s~ constituted the mogt wor-&#xD;
e of the present day. Yet, though&#xD;
and r~pected of any in the city, there&#xD;
was many a one, even in those days, who&#xD;
masked his villainy and crir51es under&#xD;
the garb of a Christian, honorable and&#xD;
virtuous (leportunent. Among these was&#xD;
an individual highly honored and resp~t-&#xD;
ed by all c1as~es of people, on account&#xD;
of his eupCos~d integri~y, fair dealing,&#xD;
and general uprightness ~6f character.&#xD;
He was at the time ~he leading shipping&#xD;
and importing merchant in New York;&#xD;
carrying on an extensive trade, not only&#xD;
with most of the European cities, but&#xD;
with the principal ports of China and the&#xD;
Mediterranean, while his ships also vis-&#xD;
ited every isle of th~a Southern and Pa-&#xD;
&#xD;
cific oceans, in quest of sperm whale,&#xD;
and the fur of the seal. In such traffic&#xD;
and commerce he had amassed a very&#xD;
*arge fortune-indeed, was regarded as&#xD;
among the wealthiest men of 'the city.&#xD;
He had 'married early in life, but his wife&#xD;
dying in child-bearing, at the birth of her&#xD;
first infant, his only daughter was entrus-&#xD;
ted to the charge of a nurse, and removed&#xD;
from the paternal roof forever. He, how~&#xD;
ever, continued to occupy the mansion&#xD;
into which he had first taken his wife af-&#xD;
ter their rparriage, living entirely alone,&#xD;
who officiated as his housekeeper, and a&#xD;
with the exception of an elderly woman&#xD;
man-servant, a Swiss, whom lie had se-&#xD;
lected front the crew of one of his ships&#xD;
to serve in such capacity. The devotion&#xD;
of this man to his master was altogether&#xD;
unusual and extraordinary, even in bo-&#xD;
soms susceptible of the keenest gratitude&#xD;
and the strongest personal attachments of&#xD;
one human being to another. This was&#xD;
nppa~ently the more strange, as the Mer-&#xD;
chant ever appeared to hold him at a dis-&#xD;
tance, and would never allow the slight-&#xD;
est approach to familiarity either in con-&#xD;
versation or address from him-a course&#xD;
so entirely opposite his urbane and&#xD;
kindly disposition towards all others with&#xD;
whom he was wont to hold intercourse,&#xD;
that it began to be generally noticed and&#xD;
talked about throughout the city. In-&#xD;
deed, there were persons meddlesome&#xD;
enough to interrogate the subordinate in&#xD;
regard to the relation in which he stood&#xD;
in respect to his superior, but to all such&#xD;
questions the Swiss menial always spoke&#xD;
in the highest terms of his employer as&#xD;
the best of men and masters. Similar hints&#xD;
were also repeatedly thrown out before&#xD;
the merchailt in regard to his taciturn&#xD;
treatment of a servant so devoted to him,&#xD;
but to all such hints he turned a deaf&#xD;
ear, as if he comprehended not that he&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7969-00000007"/>&#xD;
i2                        MINNY L&#xD;
was the object of any invidious censtir'&#xD;
or remark, or as if unwilli~ig to admit hi&#xD;
demeanor toward the S~vis~ sailor wa~ is&#xD;
any way different from his deportmen&#xD;
to all others, whether of his class or thos(&#xD;
in the other relations of life.&#xD;
The house the merchant occupied wat&#xD;
among tliQ largest and best in the quartet&#xD;
of the town in which it was located, and&#xD;
being most sumptt~ou~ly furnished through&#xD;
out, seemed at once, the abodc of elegance&#xD;
and ease. It was the only dwelling thai&#xD;
had assumed a modern appearance in&#xD;
contrast with the other houses of the&#xD;
neighborhood. It was built of Holland&#xD;
brick, which were always kept painted a&#xD;
light straw color, as if purposely to render&#xD;
it more conspicuousamidst the red painted&#xD;
bAick houses of his neighbors.&#xD;
It was situated on the cornier of Green-&#xD;
wici street and another that ran across&#xD;
it from Broadway to the river. The bells&#xD;
of ~ Church could be distincily&#xD;
heard of a Sabbath morning, calling him&#xD;
to his devotions there, a practice which&#xD;
he was never known to omit, being a&#xD;
member in high standing, and recognized&#xD;
as one of thd' most substantial pillars of&#xD;
that venerable temple of Jehovah. This&#xD;
man would go up to the house of prayer,&#xD;
officiate in the ceremonies of the vestry&#xD;
and of the altar, make devout and pious&#xD;
respons~s, and partake of the holy sacra-&#xD;
ment, to return to his mansion in the&#xD;
vicinity, there to give himself up to the&#xD;
indulgence of spiced wines, rich viands,&#xD;
sensuality and crime! Yes, he was an&#xD;
exemplary man in the eyes of the world,&#xD;
but in the eyes of his God, a most con-&#xD;
summate libertine and villain l&#xD;
It was a Sunday evening that he reclined&#xD;
in a chamber of his house, that served&#xD;
b~tth for his library and bedroom. He had&#xD;
returned from church that day, and sat&#xD;
down to a dinner of a moot bountiful and&#xD;
sumptuous kind-.~ feast, indeed, whIch&#xD;
&#xD;
AWSON, OR&#xD;
e would not bave disgraced the appetite&#xD;
s C the daintiest epicure, and one which&#xD;
*would have amply served the chpacious&#xD;
stomach of the gourmand and glutton.-.&#xD;
all of which viands were relished with a&#xD;
gusto, and washed dow~viih a bottle of&#xD;
very fine Port wine. He then retired to&#xD;
his library, where he threw himself on a&#xD;
I lounge, and slept apparently verysoundly&#xD;
- for several hours. When he at length&#xD;
awoke, he found a wax candle burning in&#xD;
a silver sconce on a table in the room, and&#xD;
his man-servant standing in a recess of a&#xD;
window, motionless ~as a statue, as if&#xD;
brooding over some secret of his life, or&#xD;
contemplating some purpose of a dark and&#xD;
sinister character..&#xD;
His master soon perceived him, and&#xD;
* calling him by name, aroused him thor-&#xD;
oughly from his reverie or self-commun-&#xD;
ings, iahateyer they were.&#xD;
"Armond! Armond! Why stand you&#xD;
there in the corner ~ What business have&#xD;
ydu here in my room, without my know-&#xD;
lege or permission-say, fellow? Would'st&#xD;
rob and murder me? Hither, wretch, ~z~d&#xD;
look me in the face, if you can, sir5'~&#xD;
the merchant in a tone at once comm~&#xD;
with ill nature and brutality, lie&#xD;
have thought there was s&amp;amp;sething iahi8&#xD;
servant's position and manner that looked]&#xD;
suspicious, and he may have affected a )&#xD;
severity in addressing him, that he might/&#xD;
betray no fear or uneasiness in regard to&#xD;
his unwelcome appearance in his sleeping&#xD;
apartment.&#xD;
"Pardon, pardon, Mr. 4rlington. Yen&#xD;
appeared to he sleeping longer than your&#xD;
usual wont, and I but entered the rdom to&#xD;
close the window blinds, to shut out the&#xD;
damp evening air, sir-that was all, I&#xD;
assure you, that was all, sir."&#xD;

&#xD;
"I know not what it was, sir, that made&#xD;
me stay here. I am sure it has been ~!y&#xD;
a moment that I came in! Tne moon&#xD;
shone so brightly out on the trees in th~&#xD;
garden, and the air was so full of the scent&#xD;
of the sweet flowers, that I rested my arms&#xD;
on the sill a moment before clobin~ the&#xD;
blinds7and that is the whole God's truth&#xD;
of it, sir. You know, Mr. Arlington, that&#xD;
1 would-.-----"&#xD;
"Well, well! never mina what you&#xD;
would do! Perhaps you would like to&#xD;
murder me, would you ~ I begin to fear&#xD;
you are no longer trustworthy! You&#xD;
have repeatedly fooled me in regard to&#xD;
the Flower girl! Yes, lied to me, sir&#xD;
You have allowed her to return home day&#xD;
by day, without bringing h~r hither as you&#xD;
promised you would! Mark me, now!&#xD;
The girl must be mine! If you permit&#xD;
her to return home from the market ano-&#xD;
ther day, without making some attempt to&#xD;
secure the l)nize-marlt me, I say, your&#xD;
life shall pay the forfeit! The vaults of&#xD;
this building shall again open to a new&#xD;

~b~ught to me here before this hour on to-&#xD;
k~4~rrow evening! Listen! you are in&#xD;
my power! Dare disobey me again at&#xD;
your peril. Leave, now, sir, and come not&#xD;
near me again till I shall ring for you to&#xD;
appear."&#xD;
"You shall be obeyed, Mc. Arlington!&#xD;
The girl shall be here at the specified&#xD;
time, sir," s tid the man as he retired. He&#xD;
added, however, to himself~ "Curses on the&#xD;
foul fiend! Bitt perhaps my hour of vea~&#xD;
geance may come yet !'~&#xD;
True to his promise~ the wretch Ar-&#xD;
mond, visited the Washington Market, the&#xD;
following morning, and fuund very little&#xD;
difliculty, in inducing the innocent and&#xD;
unsuspecting girl to bring her flowers to&#xD;
the house of his master, stating that he&#xD;
was to give a grand ball that evening, and&#xD;
&#xD;
13&#xD;
&#xD;
would pay lilrrally for the rarest hriuets&#xD;
that could b furnished for the occasion&#xD;
The bargain was managed so cautiously&#xD;
by the wily servant, that among those who&#xD;
trafficked in the market, no one knew&#xD;
anything of it, and naturally supposed that&#xD;
she had disposed of her flowers and re-&#xD;
turned home to the cottage of her feth~r.&#xD;
In less than h df an hour the poor girl&#xD;
found herself seated in a large back room&#xD;
of the rich merchant's house- Here she&#xD;
was requested to wait a short tim~s until&#xD;
Mr. Arlington should take his breakfast&#xD;
and inspect the sweet flowers for himself&#xD;
before paying her for them.&#xD;
She waited patiently a long while, and&#xD;
wondered why the owner of the mansion&#xD;
or some othe,' person did not come and&#xD;
pay for the fi wers and let her depart.&#xD;
An hour pass ~d away and then another,&#xD;
and she yet remained alone in that gor-&#xD;
georts halt tnt) wisich she had been at first&#xD;
ushered. S ic nad full tim~ to observe&#xD;
the beautiful p innings .on the walls, the&#xD;
ex~~uisite pieces of statuary that stood in&#xD;
the recesses'ot the room, the large mirrors,&#xD;
the rich drains of the windows, the cost-&#xD;
ly furniture, aiid a Turkey carpet that&#xD;
blazed in~ the riches of its roses and other&#xD;
floral devices, while it was as soft as a&#xD;
fitId of moss to the feet.&#xD;
Her patience at length became entirely&#xD;
exhausted, and becoming alarmed at the&#xD;
silence which prevailed aroun.l, she rose&#xD;
and went to the door which led to the&#xD;
hall. Soe found it was locked fro n t~e&#xD;
outside, and realized in full force that she&#xD;
was a prisoner! She uttered a loud&#xD;
scream, and kept ott screai~ing at so wild&#xD;
a rate, that tIme Sviss servant fet con-&#xD;
strained to show his presence to qaict her&#xD;

&#xD;
murder you outright, my pretty miss&#xD;
Don't be alarmed-no one i~ going to kil&#xD;
you, anyhow. But you have got to wai&#xD;
till my master shall come in. He mus&#xD;
have forgotten you were here, when h4&#xD;
went out this morning."&#xD;
"Ol~ then I cannot stay. I must go am&#xD;
sell 'my flowers. See, they are all droop&#xD;
ing already. Indeed I n~ust go! Do, sir&#xD;
let me go and sell my flowers in the mar&#xD;
ket again !"                        4&#xD;
'Ols no  that will never do!   Thc&#xD;
housekeeper will put the flowers in fresh&#xD;
water, and you must stay till my master&#xD;
shall come home nod give you the money&#xD;
for them. Here, Margery, Margery! the&#xD;
girl wants to go away."&#xD;
The housekeeper, an old woman of fifty&#xD;
years, now made her appearance, and said&#xD;
to the girl&#xD;
"The pretty birdie is in the cage at last,&#xD;
and we cailnot let it go before the master&#xD;
comes to hear it sing! Oh no, Miss, you&#xD;
shall stay a while longer. The master&#xD;
will soon be here and he will pay you for&#xD;
the roses, maybe, and l~t you go&#xD;
There was something in the looks of the&#xD;
old hag which more and more alarmed the&#xD;
~'lower girl. She threw herself on her&#xD;
knees at her feet and begged of her to !et&#xD;
her depart at once.&#xD;
"I have been too long awumy! My poor&#xD;
fatherland brother will be very uneasy&#xD;
alxut me~ if I do not be at home soon. I&#xD;
have been here a long while1 Do, pray&#xD;
let me go, good woman! Oa, let me go&#xD;
home!"&#xD;
"I dare not 'let you depart, for the mas-&#xD;
ter would be very angry with us if we did.&#xD;
Be quiet, Miss, and take a bite of some-&#xD;
thing to eat-a bit of cake and a glass of&#xD;
wine, they will refresh you, and you'll not&#xD;
mind w~iiting a spell, I think."&#xD;
"XVhere am I? What house is this?&#xD;
Do tell me; won't you tell me, good man&#xD;
g0 h0me to my father."&#xD;
&#xD;
-and you, good woman-tell me where&#xD;
Il you have brought me."&#xD;
"To a haIl of pleasure! My master will&#xD;
t treat you as a lady, but will not let you&#xD;
3 go away very soon, I reckon. H~ has&#xD;
often seen you, admired your pretty face,&#xD;
I and I think wishes to make you his mis-&#xD;
- tress !" said the Swi's.&#xD;
"Gracious Heaven! You do not mean&#xD;
- that. I am only a poor weak little girl.&#xD;
[have a dear old father, and a good kind&#xD;
brother. He will not take me away from&#xD;
I them-oh say thet he will not I"&#xD;
"I have told you nothing but the truth,&#xD;
and I dare not be the champion of every&#xD;
foolish girl who is brought into this house."&#xD;
So aayin~ he thrust the girl again into&#xD;
the parlor, and turned the key upon the&#xD;
beauteous prisoner.&#xD;
The girl again ~ttde the house echo&#xD;
with her wild shriek', which were contin-&#xD;
ued for some mom ?nts, when she sank&#xD;
down to the' floor in a fit.&#xD;
Scarcely, however, had this occurred,&#xD;
when Arlington entc'red the house, and&#xD;
was inform-ed of all that had transpired.&#xD;
He quickly entered the room where the&#xD;
girl lay prostrate and insensible upon the&#xD;
carpet. Finding that her pulse continued&#xD;
to beat, he ordered some brandy and some&#xD;
harishoma tobe brought immediately, which&#xD;
being procured, he rubbed the palm of the&#xD;
hands, and bathed thd girl's forehead, until&#xD;
she began to show s'gns of returning ani-&#xD;
mation and consciousness. ,She thereafter&#xD;
sprang to her feet and exclaimed&#xD;
"Oh, is it you, Mr. Arlington? You&#xD;
have not brought me here to keep me-&#xD;
oh no, you will not do that-I am sure you'&#xD;
will not do that! Yea came and bought&#xD;
all my fluwers, in ho market the other&#xD;
day, and were very hind to give me more&#xD;
money than I asked for them. Do take&#xD;
the flo~vers I brought with m~ ~Lere-you&#xD;
shall have them fo~ nothing; only let me&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
"No eot yet, my pretty one. You l~ave&#xD;
caused me too much trouble already!&#xD;
What are your sweet roses compared to&#xD;
ihe freshness of your cheeks and lips!&#xD;
l~o, my blooming one, ~ou must remain&#xD;
toy guest until I think proper to set you&#xD;
free !"&#xD;
"What mean you, sir '?"&#xD;
"Did you ever love, my pretty one 'i"&#xD;
"Yes-my father and brother ~&#xD;
"None other ?"&#xD;
"Only my father's friend-good old Mr.&#xD;
Switzer."&#xD;
"How 'simple! By Heaven, she is beau-&#xD;
tiful 1" muttered Arling~ozi to himself,&#xD;
when he added aloud "What is your name,&#xD;
my pretty one&#xD;
"Minny Lawson !"&#xD;
"A swcet name it is, too! Bat who is&#xD;
your father and where does he reside,&#xD;
Minny ?"&#xD;
"In Greenwich Village, sir. lie is a&#xD;
gardener and florist."&#xD;
"Ab, indeed! I know your father well,&#xD;
Minny. lie is an old and particular friend&#xD;
of mine."&#xD;
This A: lington said to quiet in some&#xD;
degree the girl's apprehensions, for he&#xD;
already knew who the girl was and her&#xD;
parentage, long before he sought to in-&#xD;
veigle her to lais lascivious toils.&#xD;
"Then I know you will let me go home."&#xD;
Oh, certainly, presently, Minny. But&#xD;
how did you know my name, my pretty&#xD;
one V'&#xD;
"Oh, everybody is acquainted with you,&#xD;
and they all say you are such a fine, good.&#xD;
man. The people in the market toid me&#xD;
your name, when you bought my fbwers,&#xD;
the other day, sir."&#xD;
The merchant bit his lips, and there&#xD;
came an expression on his countenance&#xD;
that pat took of shane and fear. Proba-&#xD;
bly it w~s a thought that his villainy had&#xD;
&#xD;
been noticed and that detection might&#xD;
readily follow!&#xD;
"No, no, ~'P~ muttered inwardly. "None&#xD;
will suspect me of any hand in the girl's&#xD;
abduction and, dishonor! My character&#xD;
is too well established to be injured ~y the&#xD;
breath of calumny or detraction! The&#xD;
girl is now in my power? ~Iie shall ntt&#xD;

'[he villain, as he soliloquized, betrayed&#xD;
nothing of what had flastied so instantly&#xD;

tdaad and allhble demeanor, he asked&#xD;
"And would you kiss me, Minniy) were&#xD;

"Oh yts, aud let me go Lonie !"&#xD;
"And not without i"&#xD;

"By Heaven! she is as spotless as an&#xD;
angel! Sa~ does not even lear me? Can&#xD;

A wild phrenzy of passion seized upon&#xD;
the wretch. His blood become itidamed&#xD;

her snowy shoulders, ~caught her by the&#xD;

that was near at hand. In doing so, how-&#xD;
ever, his foot tripped in the carpet, and he&#xD;
tell head foremost over the piece ot furni.&#xD;

She sprang to her feet and darted to the&#xD;

to the window, and tried to raise the heay~y&#xD;

fell at his feet, and begged for mercy.&#xD;

CHAPTER 1V.&#xD;
THE GATHERING STORM.&#xD;
The light of history over past years&#xD;
shows us many a scene that storIes our&#xD;
credulity, but we see only the same ph ~-&#xD;
sea of passion as in modern time.&#xD;
In our opening chapter, we alluded to&#xD;
a certain old Knickerbocker mansion,&#xD;
which had been long deserted on account&#xD;
of some mys serious tragedy that had prob-&#xD;
ably baen enacted within its walls, as was&#xD;
supposed to have been the case, from the&#xD;
dead remains Qf a young and lovely girl&#xD;
being found in a~i old well in its garden,&#xD;
and by reason of the strange conduct of&#xD;
an insane man, who had prowled about&#xD;
and watched the tenement for a period of&#xD;
many years. It will now be necessary in&#xD;
order to a full elucidation of the terrible&#xD;
scenes and events of our story, to turn&#xD;
back to days long antecedent to the gath-&#xD;
&#xD;
AWSON, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
I eriog of the strange company beneath its&#xD;
roof, who gave themaolv~s up to those wild&#xD;
orgies that we have detailed, in that mid-&#xD;
uight hour, in that once happy and lux.&#xD;
nrious home of th6 old merchant, the,&#xD;
wurthy and respected Ritter Eberhard Van&#xD;
Tuyl.&#xD;
The period was about the year 18-.-,&#xD;
and the accue in one of the, lower apart.&#xD;
menta of the mansion. This ro~rn was&#xD;
superbly furnished according to the taste&#xD;
of that day, which if it yielded in elegance&#xD;
and refinement to more, modern lux.sjry'&#xD;
ihade amends in massive richness and&#xD;
splendor, On an embroidered couch, un&#xD;
den the shadow of the heavy silken hang.&#xD;
ings of the window, through which, how.&#xD;
ever, the soft zephyrs of a summer after-&#xD;
noon gently stile, a young and lovely&#xD;
woman was reclining. He~ dress was&#xD;
sir~ple, though~ rich, and her form such&#xD;
as needed no external aid to set off its&#xD;
matchless symmetry. Her features were&#xD;
exquisitely chiselled and youthful, almost&#xD;
to childishness. The extreme delicacy&#xD;
and fairness of her complexion added to&#xD;
her juvenile appearance, and the, round&#xD;
arm and dimpled hand that supported her&#xD;
head were slight enough to show that&#xD;
years had not yet matured her singular&#xD;
beauty.                   -&#xD;
The attitude of the fair girl-for though&#xD;
wedded she seemed no more-was one of&#xD;
thoughtfulness and dejection. Tears stood&#xD;
in her large blue eyes, but ere they tell&#xD;
from her fringing lids she wiped them away&#xD;
and turned to the window, where the&#xD;
fresh air lifted her brown locks, and grate-&#xD;
fully fanned her forehead. The door ~f&#xD;
the apartment was opened slowly, and&#xD;
there entered a stranger, before the lady&#xD;
had time to rise from her recumbent posi-&#xD;
tion on the couch. He was a noble&#xD;
looking man in the prime of life.&#xD;
Quickly perceiving that he had intruded&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE OUTLAWS' LEAGUE.          * 17&#xD;
&#xD;
(&#xD;
upon t~e privacy of a lady's boudoir, he.&#xD;
drew back, and ~xith a profound obeisance,'&#xD;
remarked&#xD;
"I ask pardon, your ladyship, for having&#xD;
ventured into your presence unannoun-&#xD;
ced. I was told by the servant, that I&#xD;
should find Mr. Van Tuyl here."&#xD;
"He is n&amp;amp; here, Mr. Thornton," replied&#xD;
the lady, "but is doubtless in the library."&#xD;
Mr. Thornton again bowed and with-&#xD;
drew. Scarcely had he done so, and&#xD;
closed the door , after him, when a side&#xD;
panel was withdrawn, and a man of ath-&#xD;
letic person~nd strongly marked features&#xD;
came in. It was Sydenham Van Toyl&#xD;
the elder of the three sons of the old mer-&#xD;
chant. He was the successor in the busi-&#xD;
ness ot his father, whose advanced age&#xD;
had induced him some tine previously to&#xD;
retire, from the native scenes of con' -&#xD;
mercial life. His step was haughty;&#xD;
his countenance wore an hsbitual ex-&#xD;
pression of sternne~s; hi~ movements&#xD;
were abrupt; his voice h~trsh; but in&#xD;
his aspect there was a certain dig-&#xD;
nity inseparable from the habit of com-&#xD;
manding, and a courtesy not devoid of&#xD;
grace, that when he chose, could secure&#xD;
affection as well as respe~t. When t~ie&#xD;
iron will and the riiajesty of physical&#xD;
strength can bow to the loveliness of wo-&#xD;
man, the enchantress is usually more&#xD;
proud of her conquest than when she has&#xD;
subdued only intellectual power. It was&#xD;
with this pride that Mary Rivington loved&#xD;
Sydenham Van Tuyl, and accepted him&#xD;
as her husband and friend.&#xD;
"Who went hence just now, Mary ?"&#xD;
said he, somewhat abruptly~. "I thought&#xD;
I heard some one speak, and the tread of&#xD;
~steps, as enteredd"&#xD;
"Mr. Thornton was here in search of&#xD;
you.S~&#xD;
"Thornton l" repeated Sydenham, bend-&#xD;
inrr his eyes on his wife, ~vho looked&#xD;
2              "~.'~.1'&#xD;
&#xD;
into his face with loving confidence.&#xD;
He added quickly :--"You have been&#xD;
weepint~, Mary! Has Augustus Thorn-&#xD;
ion, my accountauf, seen the wife of his&#xD;
employer in tears~"&#xD;
'Nay, Sydenbam," said the yound wife&#xD;
softly casting down her eyes, "I was&#xD;
thinking of my dear mother."&#xD;
"Always pining after home," muttered&#xD;
the husband impatiently. "Cannot my&#xD;
love suppy to you the place of home and&#xD;
parents ?"&#xD;
t~fl~ not angry, Sydenham," whispered&#xD;
his beautiful, spouse, throwing her fair&#xD;
arms around his neck, arA leaning her&#xD;
head upon his shoulder-"Be not angry5&#xD;
with me. It is but natural that I should&#xD;
scm      grieve for those I have loved&#xD;
since infancy. Were I again at my fath-&#xD;
er's house, how impatiently would I long&#xD;
to he again with you, dear Sydenliam !-&#xD;
Suffer me then to weep sometimes, when&#xD;
I remember my loving father and my&#xD;
tender mother !'&#xD;
"Mary," said the merchant, sternly,&#xD;
though he' permitted and returned the c~r-&#xD;
res~es proffered, pressing his lips passion-&#xD;
ately to her snowy forehead, ~deem me&#xD;
not coltish or 'exacting. Your parents&#xD;
have other children-I have but you to&#xD;
love in the world as the companion of my&#xD;
hopes and joys. Since the day that made&#xD;
you mine, I have mourned that the deep&#xD;
love my heart~hore for yoo has been but so&#xD;
coldly returned. Nay, reproach me not.&#xD;
Surely, I know your gentle nature can-&#xD;
not feel a passion so absorbing, so pow-&#xD;
erful as that of mine."~&#xD;
CsYou are cruel to doubt me," murmur-&#xD;
ed the wife, lifting her head from his boa-&#xD;
om, and gazing into her eyes, while her&#xD;
own wd~e filled with tears.&#xD;
"Beloved, I doubt you not. Ibut la-&#xD;
mented that your nature was so much&#xD;
gentler thgn ray own-and ye~ were it&#xD;

18                      MINNY LA&#xD;
not, I should not love you half so much&#xD;
Mine is a wayward heart, Mary, and ii&#xD;
will need all your tenderness to pardon&#xD;
me !"&#xD;
The confession speedily restored a smile&#xD;
- to the lovely face of the wife. The next&#xD;
moment they were interrupted by one&#xD;
of the servants, who brought in a letter&#xD;
for Sydenham. It seemed to be on busi-&#xD;
ness of moment. When he had hastily&#xD;
broken the seal his brow flushed as he&#xD;
read its contents. ..Msrv watched him&#xD;
with eager anxiety. Dismissing the man&#xD;
by a sign, Sydenham turned to his wife.&#xD;
"It is even worse than [though t, Mary.&#xD;
Nothing but disaster on disaster! Ano-&#xD;
ther ship rost, with her rich cargo, from&#xD;
Bremen! A few more such blows, and I&#xD;
shall be ruined forever. 1-am called to&#xD;
Boston immediately by the underwriters,&#xD;
with a view to the salvage. But cheer&#xD;
up-'---your tears would forbode other trou-&#xD;
bles and perils. Take a turn in the gar-&#xD;
den, and meet me here again presently,&#xD;
when I shall be ready to tear myself away&#xD;
from you for a brief season.~'&#xD;
Sydenham sought the apartment' of&#xD;
his aged father, and was closeted with&#xD;
- him some considerable time. Meanwhile&#xD;
his wife summoning a faithful attendant&#xD;
defended into the garden.&#xD;
The coolness of the evening air&#xD;
was refreshing and calmed the troubled&#xD;
thought of the lovely wife. Accompanied&#xD;
by her attendant7she walked up and down&#xD;
the avenues till they came almost unex-&#xD;
pectedly. before a natural arbor, formed by&#xD;
interlacing boughs, over which crept a&#xD;
vine, laden with golden arid crimson flow.&#xD;
ers. !I~he picture there presented arres-&#xD;
ted Mary's attention. She touched the&#xD;
arm of her companion and they approach-&#xD;
ed 8ofdy.&#xD;
A boy of uncommon beauty was seated&#xD;
on the ground writing in a small portfolio.&#xD;
&#xD;
'WSON, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
His fac~ seen, as he bent over his task,&#xD;
was fair as that of a girl, ahd shaded by&#xD;
long clustering golden locks which floated&#xD;
in rich profusion over his shoulders. As,&#xD;
at~ intervals, in the exstacy of composition,&#xD;
he raised his deep blue eyes upwards,&#xD;
with a rapt expre&amp;amp;~ion in his broad white&#xD;
brow1 he might have formed a sculptor's&#xD;
model for the Genius of Poetry.&#xD;
iVladarn Van Tuyl gszed admiringly a&#xD;
few moments upon her young. ~nephew,&#xD;
an only son ofher husband's youngest&#xD;
brother Louisand now an orphan inmate&#xD;
beneath his granctfathgr's and Uncle Sy-&#xD;
denham'~ roof, and then approaching him&#xD;
unperceived, she laid her hand on his&#xD;
head, and said, in a voice of playful&#xD;
sweetness:&#xD;
"Are you invoking the iViuses, Conra-&#xD;
din'!"&#xD;
The boy started up, let fall his pencil,&#xD;
and blushed deeply; but soon recovering&#xD;
from his embarrassment, he answered:&#xD;
"Yes, dear aunt, I was trying to write a&#xD;
little ode to Spring, but though I know I&#xD;
have poetry within me, I ..,cannot utter&#xD;
what I feel."&#xD;
"Time will give you language," said&#xD;
his aunt, smiling affectionately. "You are&#xD;
yet too young, my Conradin."&#xD;
"1 am now more than twelve years old,&#xD;
you know, dear aunt, and that is not too&#xD;
young to be a poet, I should think. See,&#xD;
here is a whole book full of my verses,&#xD;
and if you will not- laugh at them, you&#xD;
ehall see my portfolio, aunt Mary."&#xD;
"That's a good dear nephew. Oh no,&#xD;
I will not laugh at them. I have no&#xD;
doubt they are all very good indeed, Con-&#xD;
radin."&#xD;
"Well, then, take the book, dear aunt,&#xD;
but I shall not stay till you look atmy&#xD;
composition, for I know you will laugh at&#xD;
me for some of my silly love pieces.'&#xD;
~He bour~ded away as he spoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
At length she endeavored to calm her-&#xD;
oelf and wiped away her tears. A step&#xD;
~vas heard among the trees; she started&#xD;
up suddenly, grew pale as death, and the&#xD;
next moment her whole face was suffused&#xD;
with crimson. The struggle was but for&#xD;
an instant. Recovering her composure&#xD;
by a strong effort, she went forward a&#xD;
few paces to meet young Augustus Thorn-&#xD;
ton, whose steps she instinctively heard&#xD;
approaching~&#xD;
He seemed deeply abstracted, and bow-&#xD;
ing low to Ida was passing along.&#xD;
"Hold, Augustus! A word with you 1"&#xD;
exclaimed the young woman.&#xD;
Thornton turned, bowed again, and&#xD;
asked courteously, but somewhat coldi&#xD;
&#xD;
19&#xD;
&#xD;
"lie is a noble boy," said ~ to her&#xD;
companion. "Misfortune has early ripen-&#xD;
ed his mind. - Even his physical fri~me&#xD;
oatstiips his yPars."&#xD;
Ida Wilton smiled, and said "Oh yes,&#xD;
he is growing just like his fath~r-.--who&#xD;
was such a greatscholar, you know."&#xD;
Mary read some of the verses, com-&#xD;
menting on them and praising the genius&#xD;
of her young relative, and then giving&#xD;
the portfolio to Ida, returned to the house&#xD;
to await the parting intervieww with her&#xD;
* husband.&#xD;
The attendant continued to walk&#xD;
through the avenues, her head drooping&#xD;
pensively, and her eyes fixed on the&#xD;
ground. As she penetrated deeper into&#xD;
the embowering shad~, her step became&#xD;
quicker and more irregular, arid when&#xD;
reaching a spot where a marble fountain&#xD;
gleamed amid the emerald foliage and&#xD;
shot up a crystal column of water, to fall&#xD;
in a cool and refreshing shower, she found&#xD;
a seat close by, Ida flung herself upon it,&#xD;
and covered her face with her hands,&#xD;
while the quick convulsive feelings of her&#xD;
bosom showed that she was agitated by&#xD;
no ordinary feelings.           -&#xD;

&#xD;
"What is your pleasure, lady'!"&#xD;
Like an ice-bolt to the maiden's heart,&#xD;
were those few chilling words. A tremor&#xD;
ran through her frame, and the blood for-&#xD;
sook her cheeks.&#xD;
"Nothing 1--nothing!" she exoraimed&#xD;
hastily) motioninr~ him to he gone, and&#xD;
retreating she sank again upon the seat.&#xD;
Thornton approached her, not knowing&#xD;
what to make of this singular behavior.&#xD;
"What is the matter 'P' he asked,&#xD;
alarmed. "has anything happened-for&#xD;
Heav~n's sake, tell me~--has aught hap-&#xD;
pened to lady Van Tuyl?"&#xD;
"No! no! Leave me-begone 1" cried&#xD;
the maiden vehemently.&#xD;
"Lady; you are not well," said Thorn-&#xD;
ton. "Permit me to accompany you into&#xD;
the house.&#xD;
Proudly the assistance was rejected-&#xD;
The young man bowed coldly, instantly&#xD;
obeyed her command, and retired.&#xD;
"Has it indeed come to that ?" mur-&#xD;
inured Ida, bitterly. "He was all anxiety&#xD;
for her safety. I see it all, now! I am&#xD;
nothing in his eyes! I am worth but&#xD;
cold words; but her-her he loves, as-&#xD;
as--'-.-he should not! And-does she re-&#xD;
turn his love? Oh, madness-madness,&#xD;
I will not think of that-think of'that!"&#xD;
Starting up, and concealing her face in&#xD;
her scarf, the unhappy girl promptly&#xD;
sought the seclusion of her own apart-&#xD;
ruent. -&#xD;

Mary Van Toyl on returning from&#xD;
the garden into the house, was met by her&#xD;
husband in the same parlor where she had&#xD;
reclined ~vhen Augu~tus Thornton had&#xD;
somewhat abrubily entered and found her&#xD;
in tears. But there was now not the&#xD;
slightest trace of' grief or sorrow on her&#xD;
lovely countenance. The balmy zephyrs&#xD;
of evening had ~refreshed her spirit, and&#xD;
the lively sally with her'poet nephew and&#xD;
the perusal of his effusiona had lightened&#xD;
her heart of its sadness, ~ whatever&#xD;
character it was-restored the diamond-&#xD;
li~se brilliance to her eye, and that buoy-&#xD;
dney of step which was a natural element&#xD;
of her peculiar grace and beauty. Even&#xD;
the sternness habitual to the counten-&#xD;
ance of her husband appeared dissipated&#xD;
to on~ of tenderness and trust.&#xD;
"I have but a word to remark, m~' belov-&#xD;
ed," he said, "My busitiess abroad is very&#xD;
urgent, and I shall have scarcely time to&#xD;
reach the boat before its departure for&#xD;
Providence this evening. My dear old&#xD;
father I find quite feeble, to-day. I need&#xD;

although he complains of no especial ill-&#xD;

beatings of his pulse, any immediate&#xD;
cause of alarm on accouri~ of his health.&#xD;
Nevertheless, during my absence, dear&#xD;
sweet one, ~ would have you extend to~im&#xD;
even a fuller messur~ of your solicitude&#xD;
and affLetion than yr ur kindly nature has&#xD;
ever yet yielded, however warm and&#xD;
daugiterly have been the symputlues of&#xD;
your heart for my venerated lather."&#xD;
"Dear Sydchham, our good old parent,&#xD;
believe me, shall have my whole heart&#xD;
and soul devoted to his welfare and hap-&#xD;

wife-aye, long before that happy hour,&#xD;

have a right to claim fiom rae, were you&#xD;
to remain ever present at my side."&#xD;
"1 know it, Mary-yes, my sweet one,&#xD;
I feel that my old father will have every&#xD;
indulgence and comfort which his feeble-&#xD;
ness may require. It was wrong to even&#xD;
hint otherwise. I must leave, now. An-&#xD;
other sweet kiss, Mary, and t.hen-.---&#xD;
farewell."&#xD;
"Fare&#xD;
The word remained unspoken on, the&#xD;
lovely woman's lips. 'Theie rose uj~&#xD;
within'her bosom an ocean of tenderest&#xD;
emotion, Which drowned every syllable&#xD;

to Boston would not detain him from&#xD;
home for a longer period than a fdrtnight&#xD;

Mary, on recovering her composure,&#xD;
brushed the pearly drops from her silken&#xD;
lashes, looked through the suite of lower&#xD;
parlors, bustled about in some domes-&#xD;
tic duties, as was her dai~y routine, and&#xD;
seeing ever~ thing in order and in its&#xD;
place, made preparations to retire for the&#xD;
evening. She ascended the stairs, lodhed&#xD;
into the room of the aged Van Tuyl,&#xD;
saws that he ~was seemingly at ease arid&#xD;
sound asleep, then softly closed the doer&#xD;
and entered her own apartment which&#xD;
immediately adjoined.&#xD;
Here she began to unrobe l:erself for&#xD;
the night. I~ was yet quite early in the&#xD;
cvenin~, but feeling in a rather melan-&#xD;

left entirely to her own seclusion and re-&#xD;

rested on a note, which had been placed&#xD;
on the toilet-table 1w some unknown per-&#xD;

Such was Mirry's audible soliloquy.&#xD;
She thrust Thornton's letter into her&#xD;
bosom, rearranged her dress, and went&#xD;
below to the drawing room in searchol&#xD;
h~r nephew. She was inIbrmed~ t~at4e&#xD;
had accompanied Ida on an eveningvialt&#xD;
to one of the neighbors. She then re-&#xD;
tired again to her chamber, threw herself&#xD;
into a large rocking chair, and awaited pa..&#xD;
tiently the hour for the interviei~r with&#xD;
Thornton. Bitt time passed by on lead~&#xD;

the poppies of Nox were placed to 'het'&#xD;
eyelids, and she slept, as purity and inno-&#xD;
cence may ever sleep-calmly and sweeL~&#xD;

the nocturnal season.&#xD;
When she awoke, the sun was already&#xD;
up and shedding a rich golden tint, blend-&#xD;
ed with the blushes of aurora, over the&#xD;
face of nature. The birds among the&#xD;
trees of the garden jwere singing their&#xD;

from the sweet dew.bathed flowers that&#xD;
blossomed everywhere around.&#xD;
Site instinctively remembered the pro-&#xD;

But there were antecedents in her history&#xD;
that might have given grounds for all the&#xD;
the calumny ~'hiehm had been hurled upon&#xD;

She had early pledged her troth to a oung&#xD;

who appeared to be ~vo~mhy ~ all her&#xD;
heart's sympathies and aiThotions. int&#xD;
-he wascalh~d abroad in the service of his&#xD;

the mistress of a home of luxury and os-&#xD;
~ tentation. She became w~tdded to Main-&#xD;

was literally given to the desert air!&#xD;
Thorntoa had discovered her secret at-&#xD;
~r tachment for another~ That gallant lover&#xD;
of.Mary's was a near and (lear friend of&#xD;
himself. There was something too in the&#xD;
- manners, voice1 and other attributes of&#xD;
Thornton, that strongly reminded Mary&#xD;
r of her seaman lover, that beloved betroth-&#xD;
ed one of her fresh virgin maidenhood.&#xD;
Nay, more, there was a striking likeness&#xD;
between the young clerl~ and the lieuten-&#xD;
ant; avd Mary sometimes fancied that they&#xD;
were identical. Singi4ar [hanta~y I No&#xD;
no! Thornton was only the friend of the&#xD;
noble and, spirited lieutenant Granville&#xD;
Ednionsen.&#xD;
Tiioriiton had been for several years&#xD;
engaged in the ~ouating-house of Syden-&#xD;
ham Van Tuyl, and enjoyed his fullest&#xD;
confidence apparently until the very day&#xD;
of the deed of blood. lIe had become ac-&#xD;
quainted vi itli Ida Wilton, a bosom friend&#xD;
and companion '~f Mary, and a young&#xD;
lady of the same rank and station with&#xD;
her, at the time of icr marriage. She had&#xD;
officiated as Mary's 'bride~maid, and had&#xD;
accepted a poaltioti intthe Van Toyl man-&#xD;
sit', rot as a menial but that of a friend&#xD;
and associate of the young bride.&#xD;
She had accordingly many opportunities&#xD;
of meeting Thornton-b~it becoming&#xD;
deeply enamored of him, finally sought to&#xD;
win him as her lover arid husband. TIe&#xD;
soon became l)o~sesse~l of the secret of her&#xD;
preference for him, and learned to guard&#xD;
himself as not to make any committal&#xD;
hiding to matrimony, or give her, the&#xD;
slightest ground t~ suppose that such an&#xD;
&#xD;
event was ever likely to be within the&#xD;
bounds of probability, though his conduct&#xD;
toward her remained delicate-at once&#xD;
tender and respectful, but without even a&#xD;
tioge of passion or love. Her jealousy at&#xD;
last became fixed in that interview with&#xD;
him in the garden, when he betrayed so&#xD;
much solicitude for the welfare of Mary&#xD;
Van Tuyl, the wife of another. This&#xD;
caused her to spurn him train her with&#xD;

with all the honor and respect ever due to&#xD;

The young C~riradin, the orphan child of&#xD;

of the family of Van Tuyl. It was tru&amp;amp;&#xD;
there was another sor', John J~cob Van&#xD;

THE RED WITCH OF wEEHAWKEN.&#xD;

deep and intricate. From the number&#xD;

will oblige us to shift many and oft times&#xD;

per presentation of the characters of the&#xD;

I motives and passions which animated the&#xD;
bosoms of each and all who became in&#xD;
any way implicated in the strange, inys-&#xD;
terious, and terrible events, as a faithful&#xD;
chronicler, it is our bounden duty to&#xD;
- re~ord. As the skilful general who dis-&#xD;
poses his forces to the best advantage,&#xD;
- preparatory to some terrible and uncertain&#xD;
battle, so must we arrange the characters&#xD;
of our story in such position in our war-&#xD;
fare of life and death, crime and terror,&#xD;
that each leader and each subordinate&#xD;
may hold his relative importance in the&#xD;
* grand strife of Destiny and Fate. There&#xD;
* must needs be plot and counter.plot,&#xD;
marching and counter-marching, baclsings&#xD;
and fillings, advance and retrograde&#xD;
movements of all- the parties, before they&#xD;
can be fairly drawn up in "martial ar-&#xD;
ray," or into that rank and file, consistent&#xD;
with the part each warrior in life's tur~&#xD;
moila shall be called upon to fulfil or&#xD;
enact. We must accordingly bring up&#xD;
again in review a number of those who&#xD;
have already been presented, upon whose&#xD;
movements the final result in the contest&#xD;
of villainy and virtue depends.&#xD;
In a previous chapter, we have seen&#xD;
the old waterman, Switzer, leave his tiny&#xD;
craft in the charge of George Lawson,&#xD;

the protection of the Dutch skipper Ca~&#xD;
Van Vechten, as already detailed.&#xD;
Whether such was a veracious or fabi&#xD;
Ions outline of her history and career'&#xD;
life, remains to he revealed hereafter. A&#xD;
such gossip, however, connected with th&#xD;
mystery that shrouded her being, was hr&#xD;
the more calculated to awaken an interei&#xD;
in her peculiar habits and mode of livin~&#xD;
and to increase the number of those wh&#xD;
came to have their fortunes traced by he&#xD;
8orCeries, and to add Jo the number o&#xD;
credulous persons who placed1 the inos&#xD;
implicit faith and confidence ~n her reve&#xD;
nations and predictions, of whatever natur&#xD;
they were.&#xD;
George Lawson had never seen th(&#xD;
witch before, but from the description h&#xD;
had heard and read of her, he did not foi&#xD;
a moment doubt that he stood in the pres&#xD;
ence of'the Red Sorceress of the Weeliaw.&#xD;
ken dell.&#xD;
He stood gazing at the witch, standing&#xD;
there as he did before her like n statue,&#xD;
unable to speak or move, as through some&#xD;
spell of her witchcraft, after she~had cast&#xD;
the piece of money into his hat, which he&#xD;
had takez~ from his head on her approach,&#xD;
and retained, seemingly quite unconscious-&#xD;
ly, in his hands.&#xD;
The Witch perceiving that he lingered&#xD;
and gazed after her as she turned toward&#xD;
her cottage home, again confronted him,&#xD;
and in a v.ice of strange and bewildering&#xD;
import, yet soft as the tones of a lute, and&#xD;
sweet as the song of the syren is said to&#xD;
be, addressed the amateur waterman and&#xD;
sajior:-&#xD;
"Hence, away, my son, across tne spark-&#xD;
ling waters to thine home, ere yonder sun&#xD;
shall go down to his couch of jasper,&#xD;
crimson and gold [. Behold e over there,&#xD;
a black cloud hanging on the left horn&#xD;

-haste away, I say! Quickly pass thee&#xD;
a- over if e great water, ore burst the thun-&#xD;
f der and blaze the lightning that may scathe&#xD;

Le The Witch instantly disappeared, seem-&#xD;
it ingly as if she had sank down and was lost&#xD;
it in the bowels of the earth, before the be-&#xD;
~, wildered vision of the youth. Her words,&#xD;
o however, ran clearly in his ears, and pres.&#xD;
r ently recpverjng from his astonishment&#xD;
f and stupefaction, he looked in the direc.&#xD;
t tiqn of the setting sun. He instinctively&#xD;
- comprehended something of the strange&#xD;
speech of the Red Witch. The western&#xD;
slq was alrer~dy covered with a cloud&#xD;
black as ink, which came rushing on with&#xD;
whirlwind speed through space, as if hast-&#xD;
ening to spread the entire heavens with a&#xD;
sombre pall. Quickly there was a vivid&#xD;
flash of lightning, and immediately after&#xD;
a tremendous crash of thunder, that echoed&#xD;
and reverberated along the rocks of the&#xD;
mountain, as if the entire artillery of heir-&#xD;
~,en had been discharged at one fell shock&#xD;
upon the earth. The li~htuing fairly burnt&#xD;
his face, while the din of the thunder&#xD;
stunned his hearing and utterly confound- &#xD;
ed every sense and faculty he possessed,&#xD;
for some moments thereafter. A ~heavy&#xD;
storm of rain was rapidly brewing, and&#xD;
threatening tO break in violence over his&#xD;
unprotected head. He promptly untied&#xD;
and launched his skiff, vigorously plied his&#xD;
oars, and reached the middle of the river&#xD;
before the Storm-spirit arrested his path.&#xD;
The rain now fell in such power that it&#xD;
~threatened to submerge the young water.&#xD;
man and his frail barqiii~ on the instant;&#xD;
but through the shower of rose-tinted dia-&#xD;
monds that fell, as the sun-rain seemed in&#xD;
the reflection of the descending sun, it&#xD;
was perceived that George was still able&#xD;
to manage his craft, and keep it and him-&#xD;
&#xD;
ii~i~&#xD;
&#xD;
self afloat amid all the wrathful ho~vlings&#xD;
and beatings of the tempest. The storm,&#xD;
however, lasted scar9ely fen minutes,&#xD;
when the winds were ,Ilushed, and natut3&#xD;
sunk again to a calm~and serene repose,&#xD;
at the very moment thesun gave his last&#xD;
parting smile and dropped to rest, yielding&#xD;
temporary sway to the moon and the&#xD;
stars.&#xD;
A few strokes more, brought the little'&#xD;
boat to the landing, when George speedily&#xD;
made it fast to a staple in the archway of&#xD;
the pier, and drenched with the rain, re-&#xD;
turned to his cottage home, at the head of&#xD;
the lane, a few hundred yar(ls distant&#xD;
from the brink of the majestic Hudson~&#xD;
-~ from whose boiling waves he had so nar-&#xD;
rowly escaped a watery grave.&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
TIlE HOltROR5~OF A NIGhT!&#xD;
Tsrz reader will enter with us the plea-&#xD;
sant enibovr~ered home of' the gardener&#xD;
Liweon. Switzer, who was a constant&#xD;
visitor, was there and, seated opposite to&#xD;
his old friend, was gazing at the sun as it&#xD;
went down ~in the west and cast its golden&#xD;
and vermillion mantle athwart the hea-&#xD;
vens, at the close of the storm which we&#xD;
have described. Tim two old men talked&#xD;
of the affairs ot theday, and smoked their&#xD;
friendly pipes as was their custom, there&#xD;
together ~n the benches of the cosy porch&#xD;
in front of the cottage.&#xD;
Their discourse was of municipal af-&#xD;
fairs, arid it was evident from their com-&#xD;
ments and strictures, that even at that day&#xD;
extrltvag4lhce, if not corruption, had crept&#xD;
in among the councils of the city, and re-&#xD;
ceived the amadversion of tax payers and&#xD;
citizens, as at the present epoch.&#xD;
"I tell you, Switz~r, such things ~annot&#xD;
long lest. The people are already ground&#xD;
into the dust by these imposition of taxes&#xD;

these new-fangled ideas of making canals&#xD;
and water-works, and the like, seeking as&#xD;
they do to divert the very rivers from the&#xD;
course in which God Almighty madethem&#xD;
[to flow, as if man, the creature, knew bet-&#xD;
ter how all these things should be than&#xD;
his M~ker. I tell you, Switzer, such&#xD;
hlasphemhus proceedings will never be&#xD;
tolerated by a Christian cortvrnunity."&#xD;
"I do not know about that, Lawson.&#xD;
Governor Clinton is a great and wise man,&#xD;
and whatever he says is right, a great&#xD;
many will believe. This Erie Canal is&#xD;
going to cost a power of money, but the&#xD;
big folks say it ~vill help .trade in the city&#xD;
y~ry mu~h. For my part, I don't see how&#xD;
that can be; and this talk of bringipg&#xD;
down the Croton water to this city l Wli~,&#xD;
1 think the idea is absurd and ridiculous?&#xD;
But the city councils have got to be our&#xD;
masters now, and whatever they say should1&#xD;
be done, they will do, and th~re can be no&#xD;
help for it I suppose."&#xD;
rrhus Switzer and Lawson reasoned,&#xD;
talked and smoked. Those were the&#xD;
times when progressive ideas had not ta-&#xD;
ken very deep root in the conservative&#xD;
minds of the Knickerbocker portion of the&#xD;
people. Railroads and steamships were&#xD;
not dreampt of in their philosophy. Even&#xD;
the~ great ditch of Clinton, the "raging'~&#xD;
can&amp;amp;wl" as the fnodern song has it, was&#xD;
looked upon as a daring and impious as~&#xD;
gumption of the prerogatives of Omnipo-&#xD;
tence himself. At length the gardener&#xD;
seemed to gr~.w quite restless at the non-&#xD;
arrival of his daughter Minny, and finally&#xD;
remarked&#xD;
"The day is closing, and. Minny is not&#xD;

"Good evening, father," said he. "Ah,&#xD;

more about that' suspicious Ion glow black&#xD;

I do not see her in the porch, as her&#xD;

the father.&#xD;
"Not returned! Minny yet down in the&#xD;
city! Gracious Heavens, can anything&#xD;
have happened to detain her'? She never&#xD;
remained away so long from home i'efore,&#xD;
father! What would she be doing down at&#xD;
he market when it is getting dark'? There&#xD;
must be something, wrong father! The&#xD;
old witch over the water, bade me hasten&#xD;
home before the storm came up, and hinted&#xD;
strangely about trouble coming upon me&#xD;
and mine! Do you know, father, ever&#xD;
since that young cigar-girl was found dead&#xD;
floating in the river, I have been afraid&#xD;
some rnisch~ef would happen to sister&#xD;
Minny.? And if that strange vessel was&#xD;
a pirate-craft, wtto knows now but she&#xD;
may have been spurted away by some of&#xD;
the villains who remained prowling about&#xD;
the town'? I dread to think of it, father!&#xD;
We must not let Miriny go to market any&#xD;
more, father. She is growing up a lovely&#xD;
young maiden, and it will not do to let her&#xD;
go forth again into the great den of&#xD;

The father brother and friend, made&#xD;
diligent search in every direction, visited&#xD;
every neighbor, and soon interested many&#xD;
citizens in the welfare and fate of the&#xD;
missing girl. But not the slightest trace&#xD;
of her coittd be discovered since early&#xD;
morning, when she was seen in the mar-&#xD;
ket with her flowers, as usual. She was&#xD;
soon after missed from her stand, but it&#xD;
was supposed, she had sold out and re-&#xD;
turned to her home.&#xD;
Four days passed without tidings of the&#xD;
girl. Daring this time the anxiety of her&#xD;
friends, particularly the vli4tress of her&#xD;
father and brother, may be imagined not&#xD;
described; To have witnessed the grief&#xD;
of the old gardener would have melted&#xD;
down to flesh the flintiest heart of any&#xD;
wrong-doer against the purity and welfare&#xD;
of the beautiful maiden. He appeared as&#xD;
if he would go distracted in his sorrow and&#xD;
lamentations.&#xD;
George Lawson, though he nerved him-&#xD;
self manfully to support his trials, it was&#xD;
plain to be esen that his sorrows were&#xD;
very poignant. It seemed he was deter-~&#xD;
mined to leave no means untried that&#xD;
would likely lead to the discovery of his&#xD;
sister, whether she wem alive or dead.&#xD;
Among other efforts for her recovery,&#xD;
he sought the aid of the Red Witch of&#xD;
Weehawken. Her incantations, however,&#xD;
were scarcely to be relied on as affording&#xD;
any certain indication of Mmnny's fate. It&#xD;
is true, he looked into her "glass of Des-&#xD;
tiny,9~ and distinctly saw his sister leave&#xD;
her home, wend her way along the streets&#xD;
to the distant market according ta her&#xD;
wont. There he saw her again with her&#xD;
flowers, amid a throng of people; and&#xD;
finally bargaining with a gallant-looking&#xD;
man, whom he but too readily recognized&#xD;
as a distinguished lawyer of the city, but&#xD;
a well-known libertine, and leaving the&#xD;
market in his company with her basket&#xD;

of roses on her arm. Here the glass of&#xD;
Fate became suddenly obscured. A dark&#xD;
shadow passed over its lace,,and Minny's&#xD;
beauteous countenance was lost corn-&#xD;
pI'eteiy ftorn his eager gaze. At the&#xD;
same moment, the sword which hung over&#xD;
his head in the Sybil's cave while the&#xD;
Weird Sister's conjurations were being&#xD;
enacted, fell with a terrible ringing and&#xD;
cI~shing din to the stone floor at his feet,&#xD;
ctttting off'a large look of his hair in its&#xD;
descent, and coming near cleaving his&#xD;
skull in twain. The candles thai; burned&#xD;
on the altar also suddenly went out,&#xD;
while the myriads of feline creatures set&#xD;
up such a dismal caterwauling, which&#xD;
was commingled with the mournful howl-&#xD;
ings of the large Newfoundland dog, that&#xD;
it appeared as if all the fiends of Pande-&#xD;
monium had gathered there in the Sybil's&#xD;
home, in some terrible orgies of spirits&#xD;
damned.&#xD;
George knew not how it was, but he&#xD;
had contrived to bxeak away from the&#xD;
awful rites~of t~ie terrible hag, nor looked&#xD;

old*a~erwafl Switzer, who had accompa-&#xD;
riled him to ~he W~ehawken shore on his&#xD;
errand to the ~or$~s.&#xD;
The old zxitin first laved George's brows&#xD;
with the cool waters of the Hudson. He&#xD;
then drew from his monkey-jacket a flask&#xD;
of gin, poured some of the liquor into the&#xD;
palms of his hands, and rubbed violently&#xD;
the Wrists and hands of the stricken youth.&#xD;
swoon was only of towporary dii-&#xD;
ration2 but it was in vain the old man en-&#xD;
deavored to have yOung' Lawson speak&#xD;
definitely, and inform him of what had oc-&#xD;
curred or been revealed to him in the wild&#xD;
den of. the Red Witch.&#xD;
"Not now, good Switzer. Some other&#xD;
ti.ime I will reveal all. Quickly back again&#xD;
over the water. I have seen my dear&#xD;

&#xD;
vidual was time infamous Col. Burrell, no- f enveloped in a cloak, who looked up and&#xD;
&#xD;
LWSON, OR&#xD;
sister; but--but--.-oh God! spare her-&#xD;
spare her! Oh, too late-too late! I fear&#xD;
my poor sister is even now in the power&#xD;
of a villain! Haste away, Switzer-&#xD;
Minny mpy be lost-utterly undone! Oh&#xD;
God! He shall die! If he has harmed&#xD;
a hair of her bead he shall die!"&#xD;
The old waterman could comprehend&#xD;
nothing of this wild and mysterious lan-&#xD;
guage. He at once concluded that his&#xD;
young friend had actually gone mad, in&#xD;
his intense grief and anxiety for his beau-&#xD;
tiful and beloved sister. He deemed it&#xD;
prudent to say no more to George. He&#xD;
immediately cast off~ his boat from the&#xD;
shore, and in less than an hour after&#xD;
reached the city side of the river. That&#xD;
hour seemed a very eternity to Lawson.&#xD;
His spirit fretted, and his whole frame&#xD;
writhed in his impatience to reach the&#xD;
landing of the shore. He was like the&#xD;
untamed lion in his cage? aroused to ter-&#xD;
rible anger, majestic and sublime in his&#xD;
strength and power.&#xD;
The instant the boat touched the pier,&#xD;
George sprang ashore. and darted away&#xD;
with the specd of a bloodhound, and with&#xD;
all its sav4~eness of disposition, on some&#xD;
purpose apparently of deadly intent. He&#xD;
was soon out of sight, and it was ja vain&#xD;
the old boatman attempted to follow. All&#xD;
he could do was to go to the cottage, and&#xD;
there seek to give Some kind of consolation&#xD;
and solace to the stricken and bereaved&#xD;
friend, the old gardener Lawson.&#xD;
Meanwhile we will follow George. He&#xD;
rapidly wended his way to the lower part&#xD;
of the city, and took up his station under&#xD;
the shadow of a tree, almost immediately&#xD;
in front of the house of one of the most&#xD;
eminent lawyers of the city,-none other,&#xD;
indeed, than the one who had plundered&#xD;
the Van Tuyl estate,. and would have&#xD;
completely beggared the young Conradin,&#xD;
by his cunning and villainies. This mdi-&#xD;
&#xD;
torious as a heartless duelist, libertine and&#xD;
profligate-a wretch who scrup~~ed at no&#xD;
villainy whatever in the accomplishment&#xD;
of his diabolical purposes.&#xD;
Why watched George in front of this&#xD;
man's dwelling? Did he imagine that his&#xD;
young and sweet sister was confined with-&#xD;
in, and made the vile thing ot the sedu-&#xD;
cer's pleasure and lusts? Even so he&#xD;
thought. But he was on a wrong track&#xD;
altogether. The Spectres he had seen in&#xD;
the witch's "glass of fate~~ were incor-&#xD;
rectly portrayed, or else his mental per-&#xD;
ception had become confused, and so there&#xD;
became pictured to his vision a being who&#xD;
though a foul villain1 was nevertheless&#xD;
guiltless of having committed any crime&#xD;
or outrage against the purity of his young&#xD;
and lovely sister.&#xD;
The house of Arlington indeed, into&#xD;
which Ninny had been decoyed, was&#xD;
scarcely a stone's throw from the dwelling&#xD;
of Col. Burrell, but George &amp;amp;d not for a&#xD;
moment suspect the real character of Ar-&#xD;
lingto~I, nor dream that his sister had&#xD;
fallen under his lascivious eyes, and been&#xD;
led by him, like a lamb to the slaughter,&#xD;
to the couch of infamy and shame.&#xD;
The house of Col. Burrell was closed&#xD;
as if entirely unoccupied. George's first&#xD;
impulse was to knock at the door and de-&#xD;
mand admittance. His better judgment,&#xD;
prompted him to act more cautiously in&#xD;
the matter, and to first endeavor to obtain&#xD;
some better basis for his course of con-&#xD;
duct, than he could rationally possess&#xD;
from that founded on the strange phan-&#xD;
toms conjured to his senses by the power&#xD;
of the Red Sorceress.&#xD;
The night was wearing tediously away.&#xD;
At lengra the clock of ~I'rinity struck&#xD;
twelve. Before, however, it had ceased&#xD;
striking, the front door of Burrell's house&#xD;
was cautiously opened by a man closely&#xD;
&#xD;
~TEIE OUTLAWS' LEAGUE.&#xD;
&#xD;
down the street and seeing that it was&#xD;
now silent as the grave, returned within.&#xD;
His stay was only for a few minutes,&#xD;
when two persons came out, bearing on&#xD;
their shoulders something that appeared&#xD;
somewhat large and heavy.&#xD;
"Yes, the coast is clear," George heard&#xD;
one of the men remark, as they came&#xD;
down from the stoop of the house, and&#xD;
passed along quickly up the street with&#xD;
their their burden.&#xD;
George meanwhile had crouched down&#xD;
behind a pile of bricks that blocked up&#xD;
the street, and which were intended to be&#xD;
used in the construction of a building&#xD;
of which the foundation was already laid&#xD;
on the opposite side of the way from. the&#xD;
!iouse of Col. Burrell. From this hiding&#xD;
place he watched the movements iif the&#xD;
men, with a nervono excitement so intense&#xD;
that his eyes grew dim. What burden&#xD;
was that which was botne along so quickly&#xD;
and stealthily by these nmufiled men~-&#xD;
Could it indeed be a co~n, or any other&#xD;
similar receptable for the dead? A wild,&#xD;
dark, suspicious thought flashed through&#xD;
the brain of the young Lawson.&#xD;
"Oh, God it mus~be ~o! Mysistcr&#xD;
violated and murdered, and they are bear-&#xD;
ing her away to the grave? Yes, I must&#xD;
be assured that this is so! I will follow&#xD;
and dog them, at whatever the peril."&#xD;
At the corner pf Thames street stood a&#xD;
large old fashioned carriage, apparently&#xD;
in waiting. Into thie time two gnon quickly&#xD;
entered, aftef they had succeeded, with&#xD;
some difficulty, in thrusting their burden&#xD;
therein. The signal wa~ given to the dri-&#xD;
ver and he instantly turned the horses'&#xD;
head up Greenwich street, and drove rap~.&#xD;
idly away.&#xD;
George darted after the coach, and&#xD;
succeeded in throwing himself upon the&#xD;
tail-board, where he clung tightly to the&#xD;

CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
THE STRUGGLE OF LIFE AND DEATH.&#xD;
was by no means the equal in&#xD;
physical power with George Lawson,'&#xD;
whom we have heretofore described as a&#xD;
young man of stalwart frame, iron muscle,&#xD;
and extraordinary elasticity of movement;&#xD;
and it may be, also, that a consciousness&#xD;
of guilt arid crime made him exhibit the&#xD;
humblest submission and readiness to ac-&#xD;
company Lawson to the home of Col.&#xD;
Burrell, there to give him the details of the&#xD;
manner of his sister's death, as he had&#xD;
promised he #suld do, when chained to&#xD;
the earth in the burying-ground, beneath&#xD;
the superior strength of his young and&#xD;
vigorous adversary. George, however,&#xD;
was too wary to be thrown off his guard&#xD;
for an instant, and was ready to inflict&#xD;
upon Wilkins that summary punishment&#xD;
he should merit, the moment he detected&#xD;
in his conduct anything like treachery and&#xD;
bad faith in the fulfilment of the voluntary&#xD;
promise that he had made to him.&#xD;
The twaix~ accordingly returned at once&#xD;
to the elm tree, where the old chaise had&#xD;
stopped; but the driver, Patrick Murray,&#xD;
and the oth~rr accomplice of Wilkins, Har-&#xD;
vey Morrison, bettei known, however, to&#xD;
the police, by the sobriquet or alias of&#xD;
"Thieving Jake," had left the spot and&#xD;
probably returned to their homes.&#xD;
It was now about one in t1~e~morning,&#xD;
and another hour would elapsebefore they&#xD;
could possibly reach the residence of Col.&#xD;
Burrell, in the lower part of the city.&#xD;
George grasped the arm of Wilkins tightly,&#xD;
and hurried him along with a speed that&#xD;
fairly made him sweat and pant in ex-&#xD;
haustion of his muscle and wind.&#xD;
The clock of Trinity struck two, at&#xD;
the very moment when George and&#xD;
Wilkins had turned into Thames street,&#xD;
~and entered a rear lane that led to the&#xD;
&#xD;
table and carriage-house of the libertine&#xD;
Burrell.&#xD;
The front part of the ho~ise was closed,&#xD;
and had the appearance of being entirely&#xD;
untenanted. The rear, however, was bril.&#xD;
liantly illuminated, while strains of in-&#xD;
spiring music commingled with the sounds&#xD;
of merriment and bacchanalian voices&#xD;
xvithin, came out upon the cooling zephyrs&#xD;
of the nocturnal hour.&#xD;
George soon ascertained that Col. Bur.&#xD;
rel had visited theold Park Theatre, and&#xD;
at the close of the performances had been&#xD;
accompanied home by a number of the&#xD;
principal actors and actresses, with others,&#xD;
the epicureans and bon vivants of his ac-&#xD;
quaintances whom he had met at the play,&#xD;
and invited to partake of a champagne&#xD;
supper, agreeably to orders he had given&#xD;
to his French cook to prepare for this&#xD;
especial occasion; tl~ougti such entertain-&#xD;
ments were quite common with the ac'&#xD;
complished, but wily, heartless and un-&#xD;
principled man of the world.&#xD;
Thus it was, youth and beauty, the gay&#xD;
and the thoughtless, were there assembled&#xD;
at that hour of night, in the ample man&#xD;
sion of the distinguished citizen and law-&#xD;
yer. Thus it was that bright eyes flashed&#xD;
amid the glare of light, from innumerable&#xD;
waxen candles irs silver cahdelabras and&#xD;
chandeliers, whose glass pendants hung&#xD;
down like icicles, ~nd sparkled as so many&#xD;
lobes of diamonds in the glorious refulg-&#xD;
ence that x~as shed around. Thus it was&#xD;
that the merry strains of music arose on&#xD;
the calmness of the snoonshiny night, the&#xD;
shuffling of many feet, and the joyous&#xD;
laugh told that the hours were b~ing pass-&#xD;
ed in the revelry of a social and impromptu&#xD;
ball.&#xD;
Lawson and Wilkins passed through the&#xD;
stables and stood in the middle of the gar-&#xD;
den beneath the shadow of an Italian&#xD;
&#xD;
38&#xD;
&#xD;
THE OUTLAW&#xD;
chestnut tree, and watched the movements&#xD;
of the revellers as they passed to and fro&#xD;
the windows, up and down the large sa-&#xD;
loon, in the mazy evolutions of the dance.&#xD;
Presently young Lawson caught a&#xD;
glimpse of the ~tall and elegant figure 'of&#xD;
the owner of the mansion, and saw him&#xD;
bend his smiling face close to the ear of&#xD;
a notorious actress and whisper something&#xD;
to her, which made her smile and cast&#xD;
upon him a glance, oh too utterly full of&#xD;
the wanton's coquetry and cunning, yet&#xD;
concealed in a measure under the mask of&#xD;
a. modest and prudish behavior, from the&#xD;
eyes of such persons present who were&#xD;
- not the especial observants of the conduct&#xD;
of the libertine and his susceptible part.&#xD;
ner in the festivities of the night.&#xD;
'~Accursed villain!" exclaimed George;&#xD;
"I can contain myself no longer. I will&#xD;
rush in on him and slay the vile seducer&#xD;
and murderer of my poor innocent sister,&#xD;
on the instant, in the midst of his wicked&#xD;
company, steeped in infamy and crime&#xD;
doubtless they allare as he is himself."&#xD;
He made a bound, as if to puthis inten-&#xD;
tion into execution; but Wilkins sprang&#xD;
also forward, grasped him firmly by 'the&#xD;
arm, awd holding him back, exclaimed:-.-.&#xD;
"Nay, nay, Lawson! Be not thus so&#xD;
rash and precipitate, lest you fail in your&#xD;
purpose, of retaliation ~tpon the tranagres- I&#xD;
sor. Stay and learn all the particulars of&#xD;
the young woman's death, ere you add the&#xD;
stain of blood to your own soul. Believe&#xD;
'me Lawson, I mean to be your friend, and&#xD;
will assist all in my power to bring the&#xD;
monster to 'the bar of justice! lBit not ~&#xD;
'yet-not yet! Time enough when the 't&#xD;
merry company shall have left these gay 5&#xD;
halls and returned to their customary ~&#xD;
haunts and homes. In here, Lawson, and&#xD;
I will show you the room in which the c&#xD;
poor girl breathed her last. The great 0&#xD;
God of Heaven help me" he added, after b&#xD;
&#xD;
VS' LEAGUE.                       39~&#xD;
jashort pause, "for the hand I had in her&#xD;
death! It was through me, Lawson-!&#xD;
own it all, sii~, that the girl was enticed t0~&#xD;
this foul den; but I ant gciltfess further&#xD;
than that, of her untimely and terrible&#xD;
end! Yet I will mit shrink from the pun-&#xD;
ishment due to my crimes. I am ready&#xD;
and willing to atone to God and man for&#xD;
the part I have taken itt the poor innocent&#xD;
young creature's deatb.I The entreaties&#xD;
and piteous supplications of the young&#xD;
and lovely girl have been ringing in my&#xD;
ears eversince her death! I already feel&#xD;
the torments of the damned, as though I&#xD;
had actually plunged my knife to her&#xD;
heart! Oh, sir, she is not th. only fair&#xD;
creature that has been inveigled here,&#xD;
none of whom have ever been allowed to&#xD;
depart without the loss of their purity and&#xD;
honor, some indeed willingly yielding&#xD;
themselves up in sacrifice te gol4 but&#xD;
many, ali too many of them forced to suc-&#xD;
cumb before the cunning of villainy and&#xD;
the power of fiendish lust."&#xD;
While Wilkins spoke the two men&#xD;
passed' stealthily into the haIl and entered&#xD;
i rear room on the second floor, immedi-&#xD;
~te1y above the one in which the revel-&#xD;
era were engaged in the merry dance.&#xD;
rhe moon shone full in the window, and&#xD;
every object was almost as distinct as in&#xD;
he light ot day.&#xD;
"Thsta~h there," said Wilkins, "was&#xD;
he deatti4ed of virtue and of your sis-&#xD;
"On your soul's salvation, villain, is&#xD;
he tale you tell me true ?'~ cried Law-&#xD;
on, grasping Wilkins by the throat, in&#xD;
he impulse of his gushing passion, and&#xD;
shaking him lustily, as if he would strati-&#xD;
lie him on the spot.&#xD;
"Holds hold! Lawson l You will&#xD;
hoke zae to death. I swear by the Holy&#xD;
ne in heaven, I have told you nothing&#xD;
ut the truth. Slay me not in my guilt!&#xD;

Oh God! oh God! ieee hernow! She&#xD;
fixes her eyes upon me! Take her away&#xD;
-away! There-there sh~ is! The&#xD;
blood is streaming from her throat! Take&#xD;
her away! Oh, any shape but that! Oh,&#xD;
God ! mercy! mercy!"&#xD;
"What meanest this outcry, cowardly&#xD;
villain and wretch! Weuld you alarm&#xD;
the house, and entrap me likewise into&#xD;
the power of the foul fiend ?"&#xD;
"No, no! Las~on, I surely saw but this&#xD;
moment her bleeding form pass before&#xD;
my eyes. But that could riot be. No,&#xD;
no, we buried jier.-buried her there by&#xD;
the old oak in'the Potter's Field! I re-&#xD;
member all now! Oh, it Was like a dream!&#xD;
I thought she was here again, in this&#xD;
room, just as I first Saw her with her&#xD;
throat cut arid the blood gushing from&#xD;
the wound. Oh, God! pardon my crimes!&#xD;
Oh~ bend down with me here, Lawson,&#xD;
and may God have mercy on my soul!&#xD;
Let a brother's prayer be joined with mine&#xD;
to remove the stain of blood' from my&#xD;
trows !"&#xD;
Wilkins, trembling in every limb, fell&#xD;
to his knees on the floor, and commenced&#xD;
a supplication to God for mercy in such&#xD;
loud and seemingly agonized tones oI~&#xD;
voice, that Lawson felt constrained to&#xD;
seize the man again by the throat and&#xD;
choke to silence the lamentable wailings&#xD;
that he uttered. Suspicious of treachery&#xD;
he could not believe that i1tin~ was&#xD;
sincere in his professions cf' ~il~tence,&#xD;
and hence looked upon his conduct as a&#xD;
mere trick or artifice to raise the alarm,&#xD;
and thus prevent the accomplishment of&#xD;
his vengeance upon the foul wronger of his&#xD;
sister's sweetness and purity.&#xD;
"Is this the way, whimpering wretch,&#xD;
you would assist me to take vengeance&#xD;
upon the betrayer of my poor sister! I&#xD;
will strangle you, too, in my burning&#xD;
'wrath, if you do not instantly arise and&#xD;
&#xD;
~WSON, OR&#xD;
assist me to arrest yond 'r despoiler and&#xD;
murderer. But no, I will not hurt you!&#xD;
You shall lie here, nor stir an inch, till I&#xD;
shall have wreaked my revenge.~&#xD;
He drew from his pocket a large silk&#xD;
l~andkerchief, and quickly wrapping it up&#xD;
into a coil, he tied it tightly around Wil-&#xD;
kin's neck He then dre~v off the fellow's&#xD;
coat and wrapped it about his head in a&#xD;
manner effectually to prevent him from&#xD;
speaking or making any outcry whatever.&#xD;
Not satisfied, however, with this proceed-&#xD;
ure, he dragged down the hangings of the&#xD;
window, tore them in strips, and tied&#xD;
Wilkin's hands and feet together in bonds&#xD;
that he had no power to budge or rise&#xD;
I r~m the floor to which George quickly&#xD;
and violently hurled and pinioned him.&#xD;
The building shook with the merry&#xD;
tread of feet below, so that whatever&#xD;
noise had been made by Lawson in secur-&#xD;
ing Wiikins in the upper room, was en-&#xD;
'tirely unheeded by the revellers in the&#xD;
dancing hall.&#xD;
George threw himself on the couch on&#xD;
which his sister had yielded up her lifer&#xD;
placed his hands to his face, and wept&#xD;
like a; child. The strong man now felt&#xD;
himself deprived of his strength. Every&#xD;
muscle relaxed, and he trembled'like an&#xD;
aspen 'in the strange reaction of his phys-&#xD;
cal power and theutter prostration of his&#xD;
nervous system.&#xD;
How long he remained in that position&#xD;
he hardly knew, but at length he was&#xD;
aroused to a consciousness of himself&#xD;
and his direful purpose. The gay guests&#xD;
were departing to their respective homes,&#xD;
and in a short time all had retired, when&#xD;
Col. Burrell, considerably under the infin-&#xD;
ence of ~ me, ascended the stairs and&#xD;
entered his sleeping apartment, which&#xD;
adjoined the one in which George had re-&#xD;
mained secreted in silence. This chamber&#xD;
communicated with the other, which&#xD;
&#xD;
THE OUTLI&#xD;
fact, was instantly perceived by Georg&#xD;
who quickly darted into Burrell's chamber&#xD;
turned the locks of both doors, thrust th&#xD;
keys in his pocket, and confronted th&#xD;
libertine before he was apprised of hi&#xD;
adversary's presence.&#xD;
"What mean you by that act sir~ Wh&#xD;
are you that dare intrude into my apart&#xD;
ment? Burglar ?-robber ~"&#xD;
"Neither, but the avenger of a sister'&#xD;
purity and honor! I am the brother o&#xD;
Minny Lawson, and your life shall be tb&#xD;
forfeit of her shame and death !"&#xD;
"Are you mad, villain !" said Burrell&#xD;
in aliirm&#xD;
"No! cool and collected! Prepare t(&#xD;
defend your life as best you may be able&#xD;
That girl, whose body your minions havE&#xD;
cast into the pit in Potter's Field, but&#xD;
few brief hours since, was my only aric&#xD;
dearly beloved sister! I know you t&#xD;
have been her betrayer and murderer&#xD;
Her blood cries aloud for vengeance upor&#xD;
the wrong-doer. Col. Burrell, you musi&#xD;
die !"&#xD;
"Patrick! Wilkins l Ho! help&#xD;
thieves, burglars - murder--murder&#xD;
murder !" cried Burrell, making an ef-&#xD;
fort to break toward the door of the room&#xD;
that led to tke hall of the staircase.&#xD;
"Nay, nay, sir! Your outcries shall&#xD;
avail you nothing.' Utter another sylla-&#xD;
ble of alarm and your brains shall be-&#xD;
smear the walls of this apartment! Yet&#xD;
I would give you a chance for your life.&#xD;
Take one of these pistols-but first you&#xD;
shall inform me how my sister came to&#xD;
be entrapped here, and what was the man.&#xD;
ner of h~r death. Answer me, quickly,&#xD;
pr die the death of a dog !"&#xD;
"I know nothing of your sister, sir. It&#xD;
is true, a young girl was here, who scorn-&#xD;
ed my love, and I believe committed sui-&#xD;
cide, by cutting her throat with her pocket&#xD;
knife."&#xD;
&#xD;
~WS' LEAGUE.&#xD;
&#xD;
41&#xD;
&#xD;
"Scorned your love! Ha! ha! And&#xD;
r, well she might, for it was the wolf's love&#xD;
e for the lamb! Better for her to die the&#xD;
e death of a suicide than be dishonored by&#xD;
s the foul polluter. Yet, Colonel Burrell, I&#xD;
pronounce you a monster a~d a murderer.&#xD;
o We meet face to face, and by the&#xD;
great Gqj in heaven, I will not leave here&#xD;
unless corpse without taking full re-&#xD;
5 venge for the outrage and violence done&#xD;
f to the purity of my departed sister Take&#xD;
this weapon. One or both of us must&#xD;
surely die."&#xD;
Burrell took one of the pistols from&#xD;
George's hand, and instantly discharged&#xD;
it in his face, before lie-had time to place&#xD;
himself in a posture to fire. Fortunately&#xD;
the ball only grazed his cheeks, leaving a&#xD;
mark, and causing a slight flow of blood.&#xD;
'Miserable poltroon! Your life is now&#xD;
completely in my power. Yet if you..&#xD;
have another pistol, procure it, and make&#xD;
I the best of your chance for life."&#xD;
J3urrell looked around the room, and&#xD;
then scanned the physical proportions of&#xD;
Lawson, in contrast with his own. Law-&#xD;
son's frame was certainly larger and&#xD;
heavier but nevertheless, was scarcely&#xD;
equal in muscular power and pliability to&#xD;
his own. His first impulse was to rush&#xD;
forward, and seize the youth, and, by&#xD;
main force and activity, hurl him into the&#xD;
dust.&#xD;
Lawson's quick eye detected the move-&#xD;
men', and it 'eau~ed him to fire upon his&#xD;
advancing foe. The ball took effect in&#xD;
Burrell's shoulder, when he uttered a yell&#xD;
of pain and rage, and rushed like a wild&#xD;
boar upon George. They grappled, and&#xD;
struggled, hand to hand, but the Colonel&#xD;
soon found that he had a fair match in&#xD;
the boy, whose hand now pressed strong-&#xD;
ly against his throat. The straggle be-&#xD;
came more and more fierce and terrible&#xD;
each instant. At length George was&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7969-00000022"/>&#xD;
42                        MINNY LAWSON, OIL&#xD;
struck to the floor by a powerful blow and claim to honorable treatment and shall&#xD;
&#xD;
lay for a moment completely stunned&#xD;
His exulting foe, sprang upon him as he&#xD;
lay, seized him furiously by the neck,&#xD;
and strove with vindictive rage to choke&#xD;
the living principle from his body. But&#xD;
the presence of mind and the activity of&#xD;
George served him in that  rible mo-&#xD;
ment. Raising his feet with almost super-&#xD;
human power, he planted them full in the&#xD;
breast of Burrell, who relaxed jnis hold and&#xD;
staggered back nearly overcome with pain&#xD;
and the loss of breath. Both of the an-&#xD;
tagonists had a moment's respite, during&#xD;
which (hey respectively gathered wind&#xD;
and strength, when they rose and clutched&#xD;
again in horrible strife. Now the~long&#xD;
hair of George fell over his eyes. This&#xD;
Darrell instantly seized, twisted around&#xD;
his band; and then commenced dragging&#xD;
Lawson with giant strength toward the&#xD;
window.&#xD;
"Fool !" exclaimed Burrell, "would you&#xD;
grapple with a man who has never yet,&#xD;
though engaged in many a conflict of&#xD;
physical strength, found his equal in sin-&#xD;
ews and thews? Ha! ha! It only re-&#xD;
mains for me to hurl you from this window&#xD;
to the depths below."&#xD;
He boasted too soon. The words had&#xD;
scarcely escaped his lips ere Lawson&#xD;
brought his right hi~nd measurably around&#xD;
and planted a formidable blow fall under&#xD;
the ear of Burrell, which ~used the too&#xD;
certain conqueror to fall prostrate on his&#xD;
back, pulling the youth down with his&#xD;
knees upon his abdomen. George im-&#xD;
mediately availed himself of the advantage&#xD;
lie had gained, and gaining his hands to&#xD;
Burrell's throat, held him firmly as in the&#xD;
vice of Vnlcan himself, whose disciple be&#xD;
had verily been, while an apprentice in&#xD;
the forge of the blacksmith, the worthy&#xD;
Olando Somers,&#xD;
"Now wretch! You have forfeited all&#xD;
&#xD;
now die the death of a hound !" cried Law-&#xD;
son, his very heart bursting, as it were,&#xD;
through his bosom in the intensity of his&#xD;
sage and power.&#xD;
"Never-never! by the Omnipotent!&#xD;
at the hands of a beardless boy !"&#xD;
The fury of a demon, also at the same&#xD;
time animated the breast of Burrell and&#xD;
gave him the strength of another Hercu-&#xD;
les. He rose to his feet with superhuman&#xD;
muscular exertion, with George still cling-&#xD;
ing to his neck, like the bull-hound to the&#xD;
nostrils of the enraged bullock. The&#xD;
desperate man, however, found that Law-&#xD;
son's strength was more than equal to his&#xD;
own, backed as that was too by superior&#xD;
skill and science.&#xD;
In the wild plarenzy of the fight, Law-&#xD;
son's fingers dug deeper and deeper into&#xD;
the windpipe of the foreman. The wretched&#xD;
man's eyes now protruded from his hehd&#xD;
-his tongue fell out upon his chin-his&#xD;
face blackened to- the hue of ink, while&#xD;
the blood gushed from his ears and nos-&#xD;
trils! One effort more, and Lawson * had&#xD;
hurled his foe to the floor, a ghastly and&#xD;
livid corse!&#xD;
He cast his eyes upon the fearful ven-&#xD;
geance he had wrought. A cold shudder&#xD;
caine upon his frame-his heart sickened&#xD;
within him -.4~e turned his head away&#xD;
from the awful spectacle, and darted&#xD;
forth from the scene of blood and horror!&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
THE WASP AND THE BLACK ROVER.-&#xD;
TILE CHASE.&#xD;
THE rumor generally prevailed in New&#xD;
York that a strange vessel had made her&#xD;
appearance in its waters, under circum-&#xD;
stances calctilated to excite suspicion as&#xD;
to the honest intentions and character of&#xD;
her commander.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE OUTLA&#xD;
&#xD;
The vessel was vaguely described,&#xD;
to her rig and hull, but the best inform~&#xD;
tion that could be learned concerning he&#xD;
as given by sailors and pilots who ha&#xD;
'naught a glimpse of her, was that she wa&#xD;
a "long, low black schooner" of exceedin&#xD;
rakish build, like a fast-sailing Baltimor&#xD;
clipper, designed as a privateer, freeboote&#xD;
or slaver. She was reported to have a~&#xD;
peered even under the mouth of the gun&#xD;
of the forts of Gouvernor's Island, in Bul&#xD;
termilk Channel, at the very entrance fe&#xD;
~ the Gowanus Creek. Others asserted&#xD;
that the vessel had anchored several time&#xD;
in a cove inside of Fire Island; sailing ii&#xD;
and out along the coast; touching at Co&#xD;
ney and Staten Islands; now in Raritai&#xD;
Bay, then at Tom's River, off Barnegat&#xD;
and away down the Jersey coast, as fa&#xD;
south as the Capes of the Delaware.&#xD;
The singular craft, whatever she wa~&#xD;
and the object of her promiscuous cruisinl&#xD;
along the coast, could scarcely fail to pro&#xD;
duce intense excitement and curiosity ir&#xD;
the minds of all classes of people. Shr&#xD;
was certainly a vessel of war, at least had&#xD;
painted port-holes to give her that appear.&#xD;
ance, though no vessel had approached&#xD;
sufficiently near her to determine satisfac-&#xD;
torily that point; for being always appar-&#xD;
ently wide awake and a remarkably fleet&#xD;
sailer, she was quickly enabled to disap.&#xD;
pear from sight, when any attempt was&#xD;
made by any of the revenue cutters or&#xD;
coasters to come within gunshot or hailing&#xD;
distance. It seemed palpable enough,&#xD;
however, that she was more than ordina-&#xD;
rily well.manned, and this fact settled the&#xD;
opinion flrst entertained, that she was&#xD;
either a pirate or a smuggler.&#xD;
it happened at this time, that there was&#xD;
not a single man-of-war in the harbor of&#xD;
New York, in fit condition to enter imme-&#xD;
diately on a cruise along the coast in pur-&#xD;
suit of the suspicious craft. Government,&#xD;
&#xD;
WS' LEAGUE.                         43&#xD;
L5 however, was prompt in ordering out the&#xD;
a revenue Cutter Wasp, oa this errand.&#xD;
r, She was gotten ready in the shortest pos-&#xD;
d sible time, doubly manned and equipped,&#xD;
s besides taking on board provisions enough&#xD;
g for a cruise of a fortnight, during which&#xD;
e time the Cutter calculated to drop into&#xD;
r every secret cove and inlet from Stoning-&#xD;
ton Point southward to Cape Hatteras.&#xD;
a Government also directed the frigate Hud-&#xD;
son out of the harbor of Norfolk, to range&#xD;
f the coast, by and large, at the discretion&#xD;
d of the Commodore, with a view to 'over-&#xD;
a hauling any craft that should not be able&#xD;
to make a favorable report of ~itself, or&#xD;
- show clean papers of her voyage and&#xD;
I trade.&#xD;
The Cutter Wasp had already been&#xD;
abroad about ten days, during which time&#xD;
she had swept in and out of every bay&#xD;
and estuary of the Jersey coast, without&#xD;
~btaining the slightest trace of the suspi-&#xD;
* ~ious cruiser. She was at length on her&#xD;
return from the Capes of Delaware.&#xD;
The day was unusually sultry, and&#xD;
there was just breeze enough to keep the&#xD;
* vessel moving lazily over the waters,&#xD;
where she seemed like the fabled Halcyon&#xD;
* serenely brooding, as it were, upon the&#xD;
* breast of the gently undulating billows.&#xD;
Captain Stauntoa had, from first to last,&#xD;
* remained on deck as much as possible, in&#xD;
order to set a good example to his crew,&#xD;
as well as from an eager desire to be&#xD;
among the first to discover the supposed&#xD;
piratical craft and be ready to go in chase&#xD;
of' her with the promptest dispatch. He&#xD;
walked to and fro the deck for some time,&#xD;
on the afternoon of which we are now&#xD;
speaking, ever and anon casting his glass&#xD;
over die waters in every direction where&#xD;
a. sail might possibly be seen. Finally,&#xD;
laying tbe spy-glass down on the roofing&#xD;
of the cabin-stairs, he spoke to his first&#xD;
officer, who was then standing midship,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7969-00000023"/>&#xD;
44                MLNNY LAWSON, OR                                     THE OUTLAWS' LEAGUE.             45&#xD;
&#xD;
after having ordered almost an entire&#xD;
stripping of the canvass of the craft&#xD;
"Keep a bright look out, Mr. Collins,&#xD;
and let me be called, if any thing like the&#xD;
black schooner should heave in sieht !"&#xD;
"Ay, ny, sir !" answered the lieutenant&#xD;
"With so many sharp eyes on hoard, it&#xD;
shall be hard if we miss seeing him, and&#xD;
harder still for him to escape us, if we&#xD;
should chance to catch a glimpse of his&#xD;
flaxen sheets."&#xD;
Captain Staunton descended to the&#xD;
cabin, and, quite feverish from hi~ long&#xD;
watching and the heat of the day, he threw&#xD;
himself into his cot, and endeavored to&#xD;
snatch a short repose, in order the better&#xD;
to prepare for the exciting service he ex-&#xD;
pected hourly he might be called upon to&#xD;
make. But sleep, which kindly so sel-&#xD;
dom fails to visit the seaman's eyelids,&#xD;
when w6oed amid the raging tempest, re-&#xD;
fused for some time to come to his call.&#xD;
At length he was heard to mutter&#xD;
'~I would sacrifice everything in the&#xD;
world, could I be fortunate enough to catch&#xD;
that fellow, so that I could teach him a&#xD;
wholesome lesson for venturing In our&#xD;
Yankee waters without the proper cre-&#xD;
dentials to show himself an honorable&#xD;
Cruiser, and not some scoundrelly pirate,&#xD;
that lie most evidently is !"&#xD;
The captain siept~ Meanwhile the offi-&#xD;
cer of the watch continued his walk on the&#xD;
quarter-deck, his thoughts taking a turn&#xD;
very similar to those of his chief, for like&#xD;
Captain Staunton, Lieutenant Collins was&#xD;
extremely anxious to fall in with the black&#xD;
cruiser, and bring her in as a prize into&#xD;
the waters of the Hudson.&#xD;
The surface of the ocean was smooth,&#xD;
although occasionally ruffled by a light&#xD;
breeze, which coming from seaward served&#xD;
to cool the br6ws of the crew, and restore&#xD;
some vigor to their wearied limbs. Yet,&#xD;
&#xD;
swell which seldom or n~ver leaves thE&#xD;
the bosom of the broad Atlantic to per'&#xD;
fEet tranquility. It came in from thE&#xD;
west slowly and silently, making the yes&#xD;
sel roll from side to side like a drunker&#xD;
man. Though in sailing trim, there wat&#xD;
not a stitch of canvas spread but what wat&#xD;
requisite to keep her lazily but steadily&#xD;
moving before the gentle zephyrs. Jr&#xD;
fact, nearly all her canvas was closely&#xD;
furled; even the studden-sail booms werE&#xD;
at their yard-arms, their gear was rove&#xD;
while the studden-sails themselves wer.&#xD;
on deck ready to be set in a moment&#xD;
The decks were clear of every incum~&#xD;
branch, while the boats themselves looked&#xD;
as if they were impatient to be swung ou~&#xD;
in any event of fight and peril. Indeed,&#xD;
there was every sign on deck that th~&#xD;
now apparently listless crew, would, at&#xD;
the first sound of the boatswain's whistle&#xD;
spring into life and activity, and that the&#xD;
c9mparatively bare tracery of spars and&#xD;
rigging, would be promptly covered with&#xD;
the broad sheets of snowy canvas.&#xD;
Thus the day wore on. Toward th~&#xD;
evening, the breeze, which had been slug-&#xD;
gish since morning, increased consid-&#xD;
erably. A fresh hand had just relieved&#xD;
the look-out at the mast-head, at eighi&#xD;
bells in the afternoon watch. His eyes,&#xD;
trom not being fatigued, were sharper&#xD;
than his predecessor's, and he had scarce-&#xD;
ly glanced around the horizon, when he&#xD;
hailed the deck with words which roused&#xD;
the officers and crew instantly to duty.&#xD;
"Sail! ahoy !"&#xD;
'Where away i" promptly asked the&#xD;
cificer of watch. The ~ head was&#xD;
now ten~ling on shore, whose blue outline&#xD;
was faintly seen miles away.&#xD;
"Right over the starboard quarter, sir,"&#xD;
was the response. -&#xD;
"Call the Captain, Mr. Luffiagham,"&#xD;
&#xD;
as before intimated, there was the usual said the second officer, Lieutenant Parker,&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
who had charge of the deck, to the mid-&#xD;
shipman of the watch.&#xD;
"Which way is she standing now,"&#xD;
asked the officer.&#xD;
"Directly down for us, if I am not mis-&#xD;
ken," was the answer.&#xD;
Captain Staunton and ~he entire ship's&#xD;
company were now on deck, anxiously&#xD;
awaiting the i oforination respecting the&#xD;
appearance and movements of the stran-&#xD;
ger.&#xD;
The first Lieutenant instantly went&#xD;
aloft with his glass and soon reported the&#xD;
craft to be a large clipper-trimmed&#xD;
schooner, but whether a war vessel or a&#xD;
coasting trader he was unable yet to de-&#xD;
termine.&#xD;
On the stranger came toward the Rev-&#xD;
et~ue Brigantine, probably ignorant of that&#xD;
vessel's vicinity, as, stripped as the craft&#xD;
was, the Black schooner, if it really were&#xD;
her, would not perceive the Cutter, till&#xD;
long after the latter was seen by the for-&#xD;
mer ship.&#xD;
"What do you make her out to be, Mr.&#xD;
Collins ?" inquired Capt Staunton of the&#xD;
first officer, who had returned a second&#xD;
time from a trip to the mast-head.&#xD;
"A lar'~e schooner certainly, sir. Black&#xD;
and bristling as the devil, and without&#xD;
doubt the vagabond stranger we are in&#xD;
search of, sir."&#xD;
Capt. S aunton smiled at the enthusi-&#xD;
asm of his officer, and seemed not to have&#xD;
noticed the seeming discourtesy of the&#xD;
Lieutenant's speech.&#xD;
"Pipe all hands on deck, then," cried&#xD;
the Captain. "We shall soon be discov-&#xD;
ered, and than we must quickly bear&#xD;
down and secure the saucy Rover. All&#xD;
hands make sail-shake oat everything&#xD;
alow and aloft. Heartily-heartily, quar-&#xD;
ter-master, up with her a point or ~&#xD;
"Ay, ay, sir," growled the old sea-dog.&#xD;
as he quickly responded to the command&#xD;
&#xD;
that had been given to him, with the rest&#xD;
of the crew.&#xD;
Instantly the sails were loosened, tile&#xD;
tacks boarded, and every rag of canvass&#xD;
was bellying in the wind. Then the Cutter&#xD;
began to bear down oh ,the suspicious&#xD;
stranger with a velocity that gave prom-&#xD;
ise that she would be very speedily over-&#xD;
taken.&#xD;
Nearer and nearer the Black craft&#xD;
came on, her sails slowly rising as it&#xD;
were from out the ocean. She was at&#xD;
length clearly seen from the deck of the&#xD;
Cutter. Apparently there was a very bad&#xD;
look-out kept on board the Black Rover,&#xD;
or else she was not the vessel supposed&#xD;
to be, for the Schooner could have scarce-&#xD;
ly failed to perceive that the Cutter was&#xD;
standing immediately athwart her bows.&#xD;
Captain Staunton and his officers stood&#xD;
watching the stranger with almost breath-&#xD;
less anxiety, with their glasses to their&#xD;
eyes, ready to observe the first indication&#xD;
of ~ny alteration in her course. Nearer&#xD;
and nearer she approached, with stud-&#xD;
den-sails alow and aloft on either side.&#xD;
Suddenly they were observed to be taken&#xD;
in, while the vessel's course was adhered&#xD;
to the southward. The Black Schooner&#xD;
at the same moment displayed a large&#xD;
blood-red flag, bearing in its centre in&#xD;
white, the now distinct outline regresen-&#xD;
tatioh of a human scull and cross-bones.&#xD;
Speedily, thereafter she let blaze a gun,&#xD;
as if tauntingly hiding' defiance for the&#xD;
Wasp to follow in pursuit.&#xD;
The insult roused every man on board&#xD;
the Cutter. The Captain again snatched&#xD;
his trumpet, and cried out crowd on every&#xD;
rag of canvass to the tacks. The otder&#xD;
was no sooner obeyed than the ship seem-&#xD;
ed actually to partake of the etitliusiasin&#xD;
of the crew, and danced to the windward,&#xD;
scattering the spray in showers over her&#xD;
forecastle, fairly snorting like a mettle-&#xD;

A FEW bended and misshapen stave&#xD;

Junk-ship of Oblivieli, each hoop and&#xD;
stave that shall contribute to bind together'&#xD;
the many things of the past in some grand&#xD;
symmetrical historical form; or he must&#xD;
search from out the iron decrees of destiny&#xD;
for such materials an shall enable him&#xD;
tnentally to forge ane~v each link that&#xD;

chain of villainy and virtue~that he may&#xD;
deem the necessary appendage to equi~&#xD;
poise his brain craft amid the ocean of&#xD;
life and the warring elements concomi-&#xD;
tant of the moral and social condition of&#xD;
man. Accordingly, many are the events&#xD;
and circumstances of life yet to be detail&#xD;
&#xD;
h ed, we ere shall have the woof and the&#xD;
warp requisite for the general construction&#xD;
r and fabric of our Romance of crime and&#xD;
- horror. The reader is therefore invited&#xD;
a to turn with us to a period a few months&#xD;
I subsequent to the murder of Ida Wilton,&#xD;
and the disappearance of Sydenham Van&#xD;
Tayl and hs lovely wife, under the pe-&#xD;
culiar circumstances of that mysterious&#xD;
affair.&#xD;
It was the night of the last day of the&#xD;
dreary month of November. Winter had&#xD;
I set in unusually severe; as if Rude Bo-&#xD;
reas had resolved to make the most of the&#xD;
season legitimately allotted by Nature for&#xD;
his sovereign sway. Much snow had&#xD;
fallen during the entire month, and though&#xD;
the ground was already covered to the&#xD;
depth of several feet, the Frost King con-&#xD;
tinued to cast over the earth his fleecy&#xD;
garments, adding covering to covering of&#xD;
snow, till it became piled up literally&#xD;
mountain high, in the busiest streets of&#xD;
the metropolis, rendering them entirely&#xD;
impassable to the pedestrian and scarcely&#xD;
even to be surmounted by the most fiery&#xD;
steeds attached to the fragile shell-shaped&#xD;
sleigh. TI~e snow, on the night of which'&#xD;
we speak, came down in flakes as Isige&#xD;
as fish-scales; yet darkness, the most&#xD;
profound hung over the city of New York.&#xD;
It was a night when, according to the&#xD;
almanac, themoon was expected to shine;&#xD;
but, as if obstinately resolved to etast con-&#xD;
tempt upon the predictions of the weath-&#xD;
erwise, at certainly did not, but left to&#xD;
Nox the sway supreme. The City Fa-&#xD;
thers have ever been distinguished for their&#xD;
economy of oil and gas, whether in an-&#xD;
cient or modern times, and it is not to be&#xD;
supposed they would ever countenance&#xD;
any waste or use of the oleaginous article'&#xD;
because of any neglect of "pale Cynthia"&#xD;
to do her duty arid light up the city, when&#xD;
the almanac declared it was her turn so&#xD;
&#xD;
do. Be this as it may, it is certain that&#xD;
not 'a solitary street lamp had been lighted&#xD;
in any part of the city. Thus it was, with&#xD;
the exception of a light here and there&#xD;
before the door of a hotel or drinking-&#xD;
house, and the glimmer of lamps and&#xD;
candles from the enclosed casements of&#xD;
the dwellings, and from the ships in the&#xD;
rivers, it would have been difficult to im-&#xD;
agine that a city containing its many&#xD;
thousand inhabitants was enveloped in the&#xD;
sombre pall which hung over the island&#xD;
and waters of Manhattan. Quite early&#xD;
in the evening, even the few lights that&#xD;
might have been distinguished here and&#xD;
there in the neighborhood of Whitehall&#xD;
and the Battery, gradually disappeared,&#xD;
so that long before midnight the inhabi-&#xD;
tants of that quarter of the town bad&#xD;
retired to rest-not alarmed, but rather&#xD;
soothed by the fierce gusts of wind that&#xD;
rushed and moaned through the narrow&#xD;
and winding streets, as if "the blustering&#xD;
s-aihr" was ans~rv that the snow ~hnnld&#xD;
&#xD;
generally by the young girl, since her&#xD;
mother was not tanfrequently called away&#xD;
from her home to officiate as a midwife&#xD;
and nurse, as well in the aristocratic as in&#xD;
the plebeian circles of society of the me-&#xD;
tropolis and its environs. The lower part&#xD;
of her house, of course, had long since&#xD;
been closed on the stormy night we have&#xD;
been describing. The good dame had&#xD;
retired to an upper front room, which now&#xD;
served for the threefold purposes of parlor,&#xD;
kitchen and sleeping apartment. In a sort&#xD;
of recess or closet of the iame room was&#xD;
the couch of Norab; upon which the young&#xD;
girl, tired out with her day's employment,&#xD;
and naturally timid in view of the storm&#xD;
which raged so fearfully without, had&#xD;
thrown herself, arid continued to sleep very&#xD;
soundly from the closing of the light of the&#xD;
dreary day. Her mother, however, re-&#xD;
mained up, engaged in boiling down a&#xD;
gathering of roots and herbs in some medi-&#xD;
cal concoction she was in the habit of&#xD;

&#xD;
of an ignus fatuu's character, would flit&#xD;
over the watery space, and disappear like&#xD;
stars that had fallen from the dark firma-&#xD;
ment above into the troubled flood below.&#xD;
These lights undoubtedly proceeded from&#xD;
the lanterns of ~e)me pinnace or small&#xD;
boat that conveyed the captain or other&#xD;
officer to his vessel, anchored out in the&#xD;
harbor, after his return from the theatre&#xD;
or other resort he may have visited in the&#xD;
heart of the populous city, in the forepart&#xD;
of the evening.&#xD;
At length the dame O'Hara lifted the&#xD;
huge iron pot from the fire that still crack-&#xD;
led and sparkled on the iron dogs, and set&#xD;
it aside in a corner of the hearth, in order&#xD;
to supply its place with a saucepan that&#xD;
contained her supper, which fact was evi-&#xD;
denced soon after, by the savory odor&#xD;
&#xD;
and evil, compared with the painful pur-&#xD;
suits of the mariner and waterman, for in-&#xD;
stance, who, for a paltry sum of money&#xD;
must confront all the hardships and perils&#xD;
of such a night of storm and cold. Poor,&#xD;
good soul! She quite forgot that her&#xD;
calling and vocation of bringing tender&#xD;
humanity into the world, exposed her like&#xD;
wise to the vicisitudes of boisterous weath-&#xD;
er with those whose general employment&#xD;
is upon the surging flu~d and of times amid&#xD;
the dangers of the howling storm.&#xD;
iler train of reflection, however, was&#xD;
destined to be disturbed and all the pleas-&#xD;
ing associations of her home dispelled by&#xD;
sounds which her ready instinct and q4ick&#xD;
ear realized to be a summons for her to&#xD;
go forth upon some errand of humanity,&#xD;
love and mercy. There come a loud&#xD;
&#xD;
which escaped from the chimney and knock at the door, which went directly to&#xD;
crevices of the chamber, and filled the the heart of the dame who but a moment&#xD;
&#xD;
sleety air. The broth ~vas presently&#xD;
ready, when she poured out a large soup-&#xD;
plate full, and commenced a series of passes&#xD;
between her lips and the dish with a spoon,&#xD;
in such rapid succession as was q'~ite ap-&#xD;
petizing to behold. The good dame evi-&#xD;
dently hugely relished her food, for a very&#xD;
brief period sufficed to show her again the&#xD;
blue bottom of the capacious platter. Her&#xD;
eyes sparkled with unusual vivacity; her&#xD;
round, fat, good-natured face expressed&#xD;
the extreme of satisfactiort, while her port-&#xD;
ly stomach showed in its swelling grateful-&#xD;
ness that it had been duly cherished and&#xD;
comforted for the night.&#xD;
~ And now she sat in her big arm-chair,&#xD;
'with her hands crossed over her lap, the&#xD;
very embotlimeiit of good-nature and con-&#xD;
tentment. A train of pleasing thoughts&#xD;
arose in her brains, and she began to re-&#xD;
flect upon the delights of her home and a&#xD;
shelter in si~ch unpleasant weather, and&#xD;
to thank Heaven for the many good things&#xD;
she had drawn in life's lottery of good&#xD;
&#xD;
before had lulled herself into the belief&#xD;
that she was in the enjoyment of peace&#xD;
and comfort, for that signal had rudely&#xD;
reminded her that she was placed at the&#xD;
mircy of every midnight comez~, whether&#xD;
her services were required b~he side of'&#xD;
the aristocratic couch of the affluent and&#xD;
proud, or at the humble pallet of rags and&#xD;
straw in the dreary abode of poverty and&#xD;
shame.&#xD;
~he hastily extinguished her lamp, and&#xD;
threw herself upon the bed by1 the side&#xD;
of her daughter, whose slumbers- remained&#xD;
the while untlisturbed. But the applicant&#xD;
or applicants for admission, whoever he or&#xD;
they were, finding the appeals unattended&#xD;
to, began to thump awayby means 2f the&#xD;
brass knocker of the door, ~vith sue vo-&#xD;
lence that a complete and speedydemolition&#xD;
of the worm-eaten panels was threatened-&#xD;
And at the same time, as if the Storm&#xD;
Fiend himself had also joined in the con-&#xD;
spiracy to make her uncomfortable, there&#xD;
came rushing around the corner such a&#xD;
&#xD;
gnat uif wind that it seemed as if a legion&#xD;
of wolves had scented their prey and start-&#xD;
ed off in howling pursuit. The old house&#xD;
shook to its foundation, and the frightened&#xD;
dame was unable to tell whether the moss-&#xD;
grown roofing had 'been lifted from its&#xD;
support and hurled into the street below,&#xD;
by reason of the breaking and tearing away&#xD;
and falling of window shutters and other&#xD;
missiles which were hurled so violently&#xD;
about in the battle of the elements and&#xD;
the gods. Even the spoon and the soup-&#xD;
bowl, and all her chairs and the tahie ap-&#xD;
peared to have taken art impromptu fit of&#xD;
dancing, and rattled and danced a&amp;amp;ry&#xD;
most lustily in sympathetic harmony with&#xD;
the storm without.&#xD;
The poor woman, however, deemed it&#xD;
most prudent to remain in her bed, even&#xD;
under such imminent peril ; for she resolv-&#xD;
ed she would risk being buried beneath&#xD;
the ruins of her old dwelling before she&#xD;
would venture forth on such a night,&#xD;
whatever ' the urgency of lile and death,&#xD;
and the peril of any mother and babe ~Vho&#xD;
might stand in need of her professional&#xD;
services, at such an unseasonable hour.&#xD;
But the knocking was incessant and&#xD;
more vigorous if possible than ever. At&#xD;
length she could rest no longer, and con-&#xD;
cluded it best to 'rise and ascertain the&#xD;
cause of the boisterous assault upon her&#xD;
peace and habitation. She flew to the&#xD;
window in the impulse of the moipent,&#xD;
dashed up the sash and in a voice more&#xD;
screeching and loud than that of the storm,&#xD;
ejaculated to ti~o men who stood below,&#xD;
as she could ~just discern the dusky out-&#xD;
lines or their forms from the lantern that&#xD;
one of t~iem held in his hands.&#xD;
"By all the iver blessed saints and the&#xD;
howly Virgin 'especially, wat 'ad ye av wfd&#xD;

This speech was more prudent than&#xD;
charitable; although it was ~~ell enough&#xD;
known hat the good dame had a heart&#xD;
that o~-erflowed with the milk of human&#xD;
kindness when her symp~thies were right-&#xD;

men who. were leaning against it to avoid&#xD;

~May I be keel-hauled if it ain't the old&#xD;

nothing, good woman. We are neither&#xD;
robbers nor murderers, but friends who&#xD;
have co~ne on an errand of humanity and&#xD;
mercy, Come now; you see you must&#xD;
rig yourseh' and make sail with us at once,&#xD;
ma'am. Your services are required over&#xD;

"Well, then, if you will not come by&#xD;

that we have promised the old commodore&#xD;
to bring along the saucy craft safe to an-&#xD;
chor under the lee of his handsome little&#xD;

The waterman probably 'meant by the&#xD;
use of such naughty and nautical language&#xD;
to make the old dame accompany them to&#xD;
the bedside of the lady who required her&#xD;
services~ in obedience to some interested&#xD;
individual who had purchased their aid in&#xD;
the nocturnal business, whatever it was.&#xD;
The two men quickly seized the mid-&#xD;
wife, and speedily stopped her outcries by&#xD;
placing agag in her.mouth. Then smoth-&#xD;
ering her in a heavy cloak they had brought&#xD;
with them, they lifted her up in their&#xD;
arms, bore her away to a pier in thg vi-&#xD;
cinity, soused her down somewhat roughly&#xD;
into the bottom of a boat, and immediately&#xD;
[)ut their oars in motion, which caused the&#xD;
vessel to shoot forth like an arrow over&#xD;
the water, iii spite of the turbulence of the&#xD;
waves, lashed as they were into foaming&#xD;
madness by the fury of the tempest.&#xD;
When the baat had got out some distance&#xD;
on the waters, one of the three men who&#xD;
occupied the boat with the worthy matron&#xD;
removed the gag from her mouth, and&#xD;
expressed m~sch regret that her stubborn-&#xD;
ness had rendered such cruelty necessary&#xD;
to make her accompany them on a mission,&#xD;
as he alleged, ot great peril, if 'not dis-&#xD;
tressing death.&#xD;

ever, were loud and wild, and might hay-&#xD;

to make a prize of your jolly hull, my&#xD;
hearty? or that we mean to rob you of&#xD;
your paltry trinkets, or even your honor,&#xD;
if indeed you have any of that commodity&#xD;
left, which is best known to yourself!&#xD;
Pooh! pooh! When we want fish we&#xD;
drag our nets iii other waters, do you&#xD;
hear? Hark you, when you have done&#xD;
your duty, you will be permitted to return&#xD;
in safety; and if you don't get double&#xD;
pay it will be because the devil's lost his&#xD;
liberality and turned Shylock! At all&#xD;
events, I will swing at the yard-arm, or&#xD;
dangle with a broken neck on a gibbet&#xD;
before I will suffer a hair of your head to&#xD;
be harmed. And now, old lady, you'i1&#xD;
just allow me to put this bandkerchif&#xD;
over your ~yes, for half an hour or so&#xD;
when I warrant me, you will see all the&#xD;
clearer again for the temporary toss o~&#xD;
your sight 1"&#xD;
The woman trembled from head to foot,&#xD;
but submitted with as good grace as she&#xD;
could, to what appeared inevitable.&#xD;
Some minutes elapsed ere the boat&#xD;
reached a lodging-place; she was then&#xD;
lifted out and placed in a sleigh, to which&#xD;
were attached two horses, that stood in&#xD;
waiting on the shore. Presently away it&#xD;
dashed through the snow, during another&#xD;
halt hour, when she was lifted out, and&#xD;
conducted up a flight of some dozen steps&#xD;
&#xD;
large and comfortable one, heated by coals&#xD;
that gloved with the intensity of a fur-&#xD;
nace in the grate. The bandage was then&#xD;
removed from her eyes, and she was told&#xD;
to be seated and accept of a glass of some&#xD;
stimulating cordial, which would warm&#xD;
and cheer her after her exposure to the&#xD;
~vild waters and the blasts of the night.&#xD;
As soon as she could recover her sight&#xD;
from the first blinding effects of the bnil-&#xD;
liaritly lighted room, she discovered that&#xD;
it was furnished irs a most sumptuous&#xD;
manner. There were gorgeous Turkey&#xD;
carpets, magnificent mirrors, tapestry and&#xD;
curtain hangings, and furniture made of&#xD;
the most costly kind of ornamental wootis.&#xD;
She had scarcely finished a survey of&#xD;
the room, before an old man entered a&#xD;
side door opposite to where she sat and&#xD;
greeted her presence with a slight bend-&#xD;
ing ot his head. His hair and whiskers&#xD;
were as white as the driven snow, and&#xD;
bristled out in such ample abundance as&#xD;
to hide altogether his saffron-hued 'face.&#xD;
His smal black eyes peered out from&#xD;
beneath the shaggy eyebrows with a keen-&#xD;
ness of glance that penetrated to the depth&#xD;
of the woman's soul, as if they sought to&#xD;
divine the train of her m9st ~ecret&#xD;
thoughts. He was dressed in a dark&#xD;
robe d'chambre, made of silken velvet,&#xD;
trimmed with fur, and looped across the&#xD;
breast by stout sitken cor4~i. He wore a&#xD;
scull cap, also of black silk velvet, and a&#xD;
pair of buckskin mocassins, ornamented&#xD;
in the usual manner of Indian devices and&#xD;
ingenuity.&#xD;
"Woman !" said he, ia a stern and com-&#xD;
manding tone, "your fame as a skillful&#xD;
mid wife is known and appreciated by nie;&#xD;
and believing that I might rely on your&#xD;

services, whatever the emergency, I have&#xD;
brought you hither. The manner of your&#xD;
conveyance to this place may appear&#xD;
somewhat strange ; -but the reasons for&#xD;
such proceedings must remain locked for&#xD;
the present, at least, in my own bosom.&#xD;
And, remember, you are not to breathe a&#xD;
syllable of anything that has occurred&#xD;
already, or which shall take place this&#xD;
night, while you live, under the pain of'&#xD;
death for the slightest violation of the se-&#xD;
crecy now imposed on you. The lady,&#xD;
for whom your services are required is in&#xD;
delicate health, and her life must he pre-&#xD;
served, even at the sacrifice of the weak&#xD;
and worthless thing to whom she is about&#xD;
to give birth. Act promptly. spare the&#xD;
mother, and you shall be liberally re~vard-&#xD;
The woman was horror-struck at the&#xD;
intimation that she was expected to com-&#xD;
mit murder, in destroying the infant's life&#xD;
without hesitation or compunction of con-&#xD;
science, and she sat speechless in her&#xD;
seat.&#xD;
"You hesitate, woman! Dare you re-&#xD;
fuse to do my bidding, madam ?'&#xD;
The dame stammered out "The good&#xD;
Virin heipin' me, I will be doin' directly&#xD;
the best for the poor sick crathur, your&#xD;
worship, sir l'~&#xD;
She was then conducted to the chamber&#xD;
of the sufl~rer, whom she found lying on&#xD;
a couch, in a loose and simple undress,&#xD;
with her face covered with a black veil,&#xD;
tied in such a way about her neck and&#xD;
heiid, that not the slightest trace was there&#xD;
to show the contour of her face, or to in&#xD;
dictate her station in life. The female&#xD;
was at the very moment suffering the&#xD;
pangs of maternity, and a few minutes&#xD;
only elapsed before the infant was ushered&#xD;
breathing into the world. The old man&#xD;
stood motionless in the mid~t of the&#xD;
floor, and eyed very narrowly every move-&#xD;
&#xD;
ment of the midwife, until the' child wart'&#xD;
born, when he grasped her arm, and by a&#xD;
significant gesture to her, intimated that&#xD;
she shonU strangle it on the instant. Mis~&#xD;
tress O'Hara, however, was not the.?&#xD;
wicked and cruel-hearted x~oman to take&#xD;
a hint of such diabolical interpretation,&#xD;
and she looked around her for those con-&#xD;
verdences necessary for the new-born&#xD;
which she was accustomed to see provided&#xD;
among the poorest of her customers, but&#xD;
everything appeared to be wanting.&#xD;
"Take up the battling, and come with&#xD;
me," said the old man, with a savage e~-&#xD;
prssion of countenance. The woman&#xD;
speedily cast her shawl about the infant&#xD;
and followed the man to another room."Y~u&#xD;
will now understand me. Take the child&#xD;
fro~n hence. Do what you will with it.&#xD;
but let me ncycr see or hear of it again.&#xD;
Here is gold so fflcicnt, I ween, to silence&#xD;
forever your tongue and your conscience&#xD;
Away 1"&#xD;
The old man rang a bell, wben tWo&#xD;
muffled men entered the apartmei~t, placed&#xD;
the bandages again over the woman's&#xD;
eyes and led her forth to the open air.&#xD;
She was conveyed to the river~a side in ~.&#xD;
sleigh, and again found herself in the&#xD;
boat on the water~ returning to het~&#xD;
humble home, which she~ was ~emmitted&#xD;
to reach in safety with the precious bur~&#xD;
then she held wa~rtrly in her bosom, alive&#xD;
and well.&#xD;
The men saw her enter her own dorni&#xD;
cil, when they quickly departed, within&#xD;
being identified by the dame. The only&#xD;
trace of this mystery she possessed wa~ a&#xD;
well-filled purse and the babe, together&#xD;
wiih a small signet ring, which the mother&#xD;
of the child, amid all her agonies had&#xD;
contrived to press upon the, attentions of&#xD;
the tnidwife i~npcrceived by the hoary&#xD;
villain, as all the circumstances of this&#xD;
affair led her fci~y to believe he was. On&#xD;
&#xD;
the under rhn of the , ing, she discovered&#xD;
the letters "M. R." which she compre-&#xD;
hended might at some day oro~her lend to&#xD;
tWo (liscovery of the mother and afford an&#xD;
explanation of all the nocturnal transac-&#xD;
tions. ~he therefore wisely resolved to&#xD;
cherish the bauble with the tenacity of&#xD;
her own life, whatever of good or evil&#xD;
might betide. There was however ano-&#xD;
ther token at present ouly knowim to her-&#xD;
self, by which the child might be identi-&#xD;
fed, whatever its subsequent destiny of,&#xD;
a tangible and breathing existence. It&#xD;
was an extraordinary discoloration of the&#xD;
skin of ihe left side of the body, reaching&#xD;
~frorn the centre of the breast, in a slant-&#xD;
ing direction down towards the heart.&#xD;
Its appearance was that of a small black&#xD;
snake, in the attitude of running,&#xD;
doubled op in several coils, and wili up-&#xD;
lifted head and protruding fo~kcd tongue,&#xD;
seerriing!y rnl'aged and ready to attike&#xD;
arid destroy by a discharge of venom&#xD;
from its gapimtg throat.&#xD;
CHAPTER X.&#xD;
'JrHE TANGLED SKIEN OF FATE.~EXTnAOa-&#xD;
DINARY REVELATIONS.&#xD;
TIlE next evening after the mysterious&#xD;
disappearance of Minny Lawson, from&#xD;
her cottage home, two men were observed&#xD;
seated in a private parlor of the City&#xD;
Hotel, apparently er-gaged in a conversa-&#xD;
tion of mitch interest and pf great impor~&#xD;
tanee at least to one ol the parties. They&#xD;
wer.e the individuals whom George Law-&#xD;
son had conveyed across the Hudson&#xD;
1~iver, in Switzer's skiff, on the day pre-&#xD;
vious, on their visit to the Red Witch of&#xD;
Weehawken. The conversation related&#xD;
to the Weird woman and matters which&#xD;
afl'eoted themselves, of which she appear2&#xD;
ed to have become strangely cognizant.&#xD;
"The more I have reflected, Captain,&#xD;
&#xD;
upon the statements which the Red Witch&#xD;
has made to me in regard to the Van&#xD;
Toyl affairs, the more I am perplexed&#xD;
how to proceed in the business."&#xD;
"She is evidently possessed of much&#xD;
knowledge, which vitally effects your in-&#xD;
terest in :hat complicated and involved&#xD;
inheritance, I should say, my dear Coun-&#xD;
sellor."&#xD;
"It would really seem so, Captain; yet&#xD;
I -am not disposed to place much reliance&#xD;
upon any vague kuowledge the Witch&#xD;
may have in respect to the affairs in which&#xD;
I am so nearly interested."&#xD;
"The facts she has detailed, you admit&#xD;
to be mainly true~ -why may she not,&#xD;
then, be familiar on all those other points&#xD;
which are especially involved in ob-&#xD;
scurity and doubt ?"&#xD;
"You know, Captain, she may have&#xD;
picked up many things by common report,&#xD;
and treasured thent for some sinister pur-&#xD;
pose, or it may be for mere profit; who&#xD;
knows  '1&#xD;
"But she declined aoceptingyour purse&#xD;
for leer professional services, at any rate,&#xD;
Coupsellor, and that fact alone would not&#xD;
,3ustify your suspicion of the impurity of&#xD;
her motives and integrity, allow me to&#xD;
suggest, my dear sir."&#xD;
"Indeed, it would not, Captain, yet&#xD;
were I constrained to summon her before&#xD;
the Courts, her evidence might be found&#xD;
merely the ravings of a maniac, and ulti-&#xD;
mate to the greater damage of my cause."&#xD;
"The woman. undoubtedly is strangely&#xD;
eccentric, butl have never been able to&#xD;
discover anything like inanity about her,&#xD;
during the many years since I first form-&#xD;
ed her acquaintance."&#xD;
"It she be not deranged, Captain, yet&#xD;
she may have some dark purpose to ac-&#xD;
complish in her proffered readiness to&#xD;
reveal those secrets, pretended or real, of&#xD;
which she confesses she is poss~sscd ia&#xD;

&#xD;
regard to the affairs of the family, ol&#xD;
which it would seem, I am now the sole&#xD;
and unfortunate heir."&#xD;
"Yet, Counsellor, to know the worst&#xD;
the Fates have in store for you, could&#xD;
scarcely be more disastrous to your best&#xD;
interests, than the dark and complicated&#xD;
mystery which hangs upon your ancestral&#xD;
name."&#xD;
"That is reasonable philosophy, Captain,&#xD;
I grant you. But there have already&#xD;
been so frequent ripping open of 'old&#xD;
wounds, in regard to the conduct of my&#xD;
relatives that I feel could I shrink away&#xD;
in disgust, and abandon my suits at law&#xD;
in despair."&#xD;
"That would be foolish, indeed, while&#xD;
there was the remotest prospect of suc-&#xD;
ces~', or any reasonable chance to worry&#xD;
off and defeat your wily legal antagonist,&#xD;
Col. Darrell."&#xD;
"The Knave has already possessed&#xD;
himself of the lion's sh~re of the estate,&#xD;
and is likely in the end to secure the&#xD;
oysters, and leave me the shells merely,&#xD;
Captain."&#xD;
"So be it, if you will, Counsellor;&#xD;
nevertheless, I think, were I in your place,&#xD;
I should at every hazard, produce the&#xD;
Witch's testimony, and trust to Heaven&#xD;
for a safe deliverance of the trouble."&#xD;
"I believe you counsel wisely, Captain,&#xD;
and you have my hearty thanks for the&#xD;
disinterested interest you have manifested&#xD;
in my affairs from first to last."&#xD;
£LNot at all-not at all. I however&#xD;
feel, I cannot tell why, that your destiny&#xD;
is more nearly linked with the mystery&#xD;
which surrounds the character of the Red&#xD;
Sorceress than has been thus far permitted&#xD;
you to solve. She may have been some&#xD;
discarded mistress of your Uncle Syden-&#xD;
ham, or, which, is more likely a discarded&#xD;
paramour of Col. Burrell himself; and in&#xD;
either case might prove a material wit-&#xD;
&#xD;
ness in the elucidation of' the kgal diffi&#xD;
eulties in which you are involved."&#xD;
"Poohjooh Captain; excuse me;&#xD;
but really you make me smile at the idea&#xD;
of' the 'Witch having been a mistress of&#xD;
either my uncle or of Col Burreli, both,&#xD;
you are aware, being men to whom all&#xD;
the world has given at least, the credit of&#xD;
good taste in their amours and gallantries.&#xD;
Ha! ha! ha l Captain, how absurd to&#xD;
imagine that my gallant uncle, for in-&#xD;
stance, would have chosen a lover old&#xD;
enough to be his grand mother, and ugly&#xD;
and withered withal 1"&#xD;
"Ah, I perceive you are inclined to 1e&#xD;
facetious, Counsellor; but you should&#xD;
consider that a period of fifteen or rtventy&#xD;
years of extreme affliction or sorrows are&#xD;
long enuu~h even to render the most&#xD;
youthful and blooming of her sex, prema-&#xD;
turely gray and decrepid, even as the Red&#xD;
Witch does surely at present seem to be.&#xD;
Certainly, when I first saw her she was a&#xD;
far different looking woman than she is&#xD;
now; in fact, she was a lady whose&#xD;
beauty and accomplishments would not&#xD;
have reflected in the slightest rnaaner on&#xD;
the good taste of the most discninilnating&#xD;
ot the gallant~, whatever the amorous&#xD;
impulses of their bosoms."&#xD;
"True, true, I did not think, Captain ol&#xD;
the ravages time and trouble are calcu-&#xD;
lated to make on the soundest of consti-&#xD;
tutions. For myself, at least, I can speak.&#xD;
Though a young man, scarcely passed&#xD;
beyond my third decade of years. I feel&#xD;
that I am already failing into the "sear&#xD;
and yellow leaf" of age; all, too, through&#xD;
-the annoyances and vexations to wl ich I&#xD;
have been subj~cted in order to reinstate&#xD;
myself in what I have ever considered&#xD;
as my lawful inheritance"&#xD;
"And yet you was but a mere boy, just&#xD;
passed intO your teens, when your family&#xD;
became involved in the calamtilies v4~ieh&#xD;
&#xD;
now threaten the very extinction of the&#xD;
Van Toyl name, since you remain a&#xD;
bachelor and are the last of ~he tiame&#xD;
known to be alive, my dear Counsellor."&#xD;
"That was indeed a terrible blow, yet I&#xD;
have always been impressed that my un-&#xD;
cle Sydenham had nothing whatever to&#xD;
do with the tragedy of that eventful night&#xD;
of his disappearance. The poor girl, Ida&#xD;
Wilton, I am sure, was rather a favorite&#xD;
with my uncle than otherwise; while my&#xD;
Aunt Mary was too full of sweetness and&#xD;
gentleness, and withal too young to have&#xD;
been guilty of any indiscretion with either&#xD;
her midshipman lover, Grenville Edmon-&#xD;
~ton, or my uncle's counting-house assist-~&#xD;
ant, Augustus Thornton, to have aroused&#xD;
the jealousy of my relative and induced&#xD;
1Pm to avenge any starni that he fancied&#xD;
had been cast upon his manliness and&#xD;
honor.. But I like not to dwell upon&#xD;
those distressing events. Yet, Captain&#xD;
Van Vetchen, a thought has just struck&#xD;
me that there has been, or may be a con-&#xD;
nection between this Red Witch, Maria&#xD;
de Vaux, and my Aunt Mary, if, indeed,&#xD;
they are not one and the same person!&#xD;
But no-that cannot-cannot be. My&#xD;
aunt, as I have learned from her own fa-&#xD;
ther, died in giving birth to her first child,&#xD;
which also ceased to exist within a few&#xD;
hours after its unhappy mother's demise.&#xD;
At all events, Captain, you promised to&#xD;
rulighten in regard to the manner of your&#xD;
earl lest acquaintance with Maria De Vauxr&#xD;
and your relations with her since. And&#xD;
now, if it would not be trespassing too&#xD;
far upon your kindness and time, I would&#xD;
be glad to hear at once whatever you may&#xD;
be pleased to communicate in this re-&#xD;
gard."&#xD;
"With all my heart, my dear sir. I am&#xD;
at your service entirely this evening, and if&#xD;
you will draw here with me in the corner,&#xD;
somewhat wore out of the way of listen-&#xD;
&#xD;
ers, you shall learn of such portion&#xD;
of her strange histo ryas maybe inmy&#xD;
pOwer to cornmt~nicate. On what points&#xD;
in her career would you be more espec-&#xD;
isily enlightened, my dear Conradin ?"&#xD;
"Tell me, first of all, about the year, or&#xD;
the date of your first interview with Ma-&#xD;
na de Vaux, if you please."&#xD;
"It was on the 13th of February in the&#xD;
year 18-, just fourteen years and four&#xD;
months to this very day, sir."&#xD;
"Upon my word, Captain, you are very&#xD;
precise in your reckoning. There must&#xD;
have been extraordinary circumstance&#xD;
about your first interview with her to have&#xD;
impressed the tints so vividly upon your&#xD;
memory."&#xD;
'~Even so."&#xD;
'Whett the boy applied for the situation&#xD;
of&#xD;
"The boy, Captain! It is of Maria&#xD;
De Vaux I would learn something."&#xD;
"And it is of her I was about to speak&#xD;
when you. interrupted me."&#xD;
"Beg your pardon, Captain; Go on.&#xD;
What of theby~"'&#xD;
"Yes, I must call her the lad, or I shall&#xD;

"Well, then, the lad-what of him ?"&#xD;
"He applied for the herth of cabin.boy&#xD;

a woman! It was thea that I understood&#xD;
iii some degree the motives which ificeuced&#xD;
her to assume the habiliaments of the op-&#xD;
posite sex and risk the perils of an ocean&#xD;
&#xD;
life. She cherished some secret purpose&#xD;
in vtsit*ing the Island, and begged p~r-&#xD;
mission to remain behind till she should&#xD;
aee~irnplish the end thereof. I was con-&#xD;
vinced that her story was true, and sym-&#xD;
pathized with her wrongs. It was enough&#xD;
fur me to apprehend that her betrayer&#xD;
was supposed to be living ia some part of&#xD;
the Island, and therefore I questioned her&#xD;
neither concerning her own name nor the&#xD;
one borne by the villian for whom she was&#xD;
in stwh determined pursuit. When I of-&#xD;
fered to provide her with funds to further&#xD;
her desiguis, I found that her means were&#xD;
amply abundant. Jodeed, she also insis-&#xD;
ted upon pa3ing for her passage out, to&#xD;
which proposition, of course, 1 would not&#xD;
listen. I itrovided her a comfortable&#xD;
home with the family of a respectable&#xD;
Dutch merchant, to await the issue of&#xD;
events, while I continued my pursuits of&#xD;
the sea. I parted from her and dd not&#xD;
again meet her for ten years afterwards,&#xD;
when 1 fouod her at Batavia, and brought&#xD;
her back to New York. I have never&#xD;
dared, or rather have never wished to lift&#xD;
the veil of mystery that surrounds her be-&#xD;
tug, having ever been satisfied that the&#xD;
secrets of her bosom are of that holy and&#xD;
sacred kind, nut to be ~vantoztly trespa~s-&#xD;
cii upon by th~ impertinence and curiosity&#xD;
of a malicious and meddlesome world.-&#xD;
Lattisrly, however, I have come to the&#xD;
conclns~on that she was in some way or&#xD;
other connected with the destiny of. your&#xD;
long rxii-~ing uncle Syd.~nham, which sur-&#xD;
mise is greatly strengthened by the state-&#xD;
meids she made to you yesterday about&#xD;
your family aflitirs. Yoa have now all I&#xD;

"Time must determine that. Perhaps a father and friend from the fir.&#xD;
&#xD;
qt your next interview with her you may&#xD;
be able to arrive at a difThrent conclusion.&#xD;
When I met you, at Batavia, in search of&#xD;
testimony among your uncle's and grand-&#xD;
father's former correspondents, it struck&#xD;
me even there that the Red witch would&#xD;
be able to enlighten you greatly in regard&#xD;
to the Van Tuyl affairs. This was the&#xD;
motive I had in diverting your attention&#xD;
in that direction."&#xD;
"We have then only to await the issue&#xD;
of events, Captain. We cannot pull aside&#xD;
either the curtains of the Past, or lift the&#xD;
veil of the Future. I must bide, accord-&#xD;
ingly my time. But, that little romance&#xD;
in your own history, Captain. It is yet&#xD;
early. Shall we have it now !'&#xD;
"As you please I I will make the story&#xD;
very short. I am able to give it more suc-&#xD;
cinctly from a manuscript I have in my&#xD;
possession, which I found among the pa-&#xD;
pers of my deceased fos'er-father. it is to&#xD;
this effect, that when I was a child sppsr~&#xD;
ently about five years of age, I was found&#xD;
lying asleep under a small boat, which&#xD;
was placed bottom up~vards on the deck&#xD;
of a ship, which the old Captain command-&#xD;
ed, after it had left the wharf and j~ut to&#xD;
sea. I was too young to give an intelligi-&#xD;
ble account of the manner how I caine on&#xD;
board, or even to give my family name.&#xD;
The Captain, however, took pity on my&#xD;
condition, and though he realized my pa-&#xD;
rents must have experienced poignant sor~&#xD;
row at my strange disappearance, he did&#xD;
n ot feel warranted to put back and&#xD;
discharge his precious cargo. The voy-&#xD;
age was to Canton, and it was two years&#xD;
befdrehe again returned to New-York, to&#xD;
institute inquiry in my behalf. lie ad-&#xD;
vertised the circumstances under which I&#xD;
was found on hoard his ship, but received&#xD;
no response to his story. Meanwhile he&#xD;
gave me his own name, and conUnued as&#xD;
&#xD;
hour he saw me till the day of his death&#xD;
through a period of about twenty year.&#xD;
altogether. It may interest you, also, m2&#xD;
dear sir, to state that I have in my posses&#xD;
sion the identical suit .of clothing I wore a&#xD;
the same time I was discovered in m~&#xD;
infancy on board the Sea Gull, (whic~&#xD;
was the name of the vessel) by the goor&#xD;
Captain, who became my foster-father an&#xD;
friend. I. have likewise a full length pot,&#xD;
trait of myself which the old gentleman&#xD;
the worthy Captain Jacob Van Vechter'&#xD;
had caused' to be painted on the return&#xD;
voyage, with a view to my identification&#xD;
by my friends. Besides this, I have like.&#xD;
wise a miniature of a lady, doubtless thar&#xD;
of my mother, which was found concealed:&#xD;
in my bosom at the time I was found, su~&#xD;
ended by a fine gold chain from my neck&#xD;
These little baubles may possibly one ot-&#xD;
these days afford a clue to my own ligiti-&#xD;
mate origin, though so many years have&#xD;
already passed, I scarcely expect now ever&#xD;
tobe enlightened on so important and in-&#xD;
teresting a point."&#xD;
"Really, Captain; your own history&#xD;
is equally remarkable with that of the&#xD;
Weird Sister of the Cave. It is a romance&#xD;
in real life, exceeding in interest any novel&#xD;
I have ever read."&#xD;
"lodeed, Counsellor, my adventure&#xD;
from first to last, would make a book quite&#xD;
as entertaining as thst of 'Sinhad the Sail-&#xD;
or,' or 'Jack the Giant Killer,~ or 'Gulhiver's&#xD;

tam, with a quizzical expression of his&#xD;
countenance and a merry twinkle about&#xD;
his eye, as it he meant to say he under~&#xD;
stood the counsellor's remark as ajok'es&#xD;

might be the upshot of such a publica-&#xD;

"Have you ever related your story to&#xD;
the Red Witch, and consulted her oracular&#xD;
powers in regard to yout parentage and&#xD;
birth, Captain."&#xD;
"I have not, my dear Counsellor; but&#xD;
since you have reminded me of it, I will&#xD;
consult her in regard thereto one of these&#xD;
days, by way of curiosity, nothing more-&#xD;
when I would be happy to have you pres-&#xD;

not trust her with the hidden things per-&#xD;
taining to your destiny 'f If nothing jut-&#xD;

The friends agreed upon the hour when&#xD;
they would pay their visit to the Red Sor-&#xD;

day; and after some casual remarks about&#xD;
Miuny Lawson, the missing girl, elicited&#xD;
from the advertisements which had just ap-&#xD;

adopted it as our own, instead of giving&#xD;

The old gravedigger had thrown down&#xD;
only a few shovels full of earth upon the&#xD;
coffin to fill up the grave, h~fore tie was&#xD;
seized and treated in the iongh manner&#xD;
we have described. It was oceordingly&#xD;

place of the dead, after having set the old&#xD;
Sexton at liberty, and signifying to him to.&#xD;
resume his duty in filling up the cavern,&#xD;

In less than an hour afterwards the old&#xD;
grave-digger had filled the grave, and&#xD;
taken up his mnattocks and spade arid de-&#xD;

Scarcely had the Doctor finished his&#xD;
speech before there came a messenger in&#xD;
breathless speed, and claimed admisajon&#xD;

"Terrible news, gentlemen! Col. Bur-&#xD;

"Horrible l horrible !" was the ejacula-&#xD;

CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
THE FREAKS OF FORTUNE.&#xD;
MORGAN Rivington, the father of Mary&#xD;
wife of Sydenham Van Tuyl, some years&#xD;
before the marriage of his daughter, was&#xD;
among the most affluent and respected&#xD;
gcntleman-farmers or planters in the mid-&#xD;
dle of the state of New Jersey. His&#xD;
plantation consisted of several hundred&#xD;
acres of the richest soil, all unoer the&#xD;
highest cultivation, with the exception&#xD;
of such tracts of woodlands as were re-&#xD;
served for fuel and fence railings when&#xD;
required. his pastures were ample, on&#xD;
which grazed and sported many domestic&#xD;
animals, horses, cows and sheep. His&#xD;
peach and apple orchards were the finest&#xD;
and most productive of any others in the&#xD;
state, especially the peach crop, which&#xD;
was celebrated in the New York and Phi-&#xD;
ladelphia markets on account of the large&#xD;
size of the fruit, their crimson and golden&#xD;
hue, and lusciousness of flavor. His&#xD;
harvests of wheat, rye, barley and corn,&#xD;
buckwheat, Carolina and Irish potatoes,&#xD;
melons of all kinds, vegetables, milk and&#xD;
butter, cheese and honey, were always&#xD;
abundant, while of poultry and swine the&#xD;
number was nearly innumerable of the&#xD;
best and rarest breeds in America. Thus&#xD;
he appeared to be blest in everything the&#xD;
heart could desire, so that hi~ neighbors&#xD;
regarded him as among the luckiest and&#xD;
happiest of mankind. And such was the&#xD;
fact, in point of. every earthly joy and&#xD;
comfort.&#xD;
At this time his family consisted of an&#xD;
affectionate and amiable wife, two spns&#xD;
and four daughters. The eldest, Melville&#xD;
Rivinglon, had reached his twentieth&#xD;
year and was pursuing a collegiate course&#xD;
at Princeton, with a view to the subse-&#xD;
quent study of the law, after having re-&#xD;
ceived his diploma as a graduate.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE OUTLAW&#xD;
The second child was Amelia Rivington.&#xD;
who married when in her seventeenth&#xD;
year, Herbert Waldegrave, a young an&#xD;
enterprising shipping merchant, whi&#xD;
received his mercantile training in the&#xD;
house of the renowned Stephen Girard,&#xD;
who had just set him up in business&#xD;
and lent him his powerful name, as&#xD;
merchant and banker, to facilitate his tra-&#xD;
ding operations. Amelia had now been&#xD;
absent from the paternal roof about two&#xD;
years, and was living happily with her&#xD;
husband in the Quaker City, the mother&#xD;
of a beautiful boy, and enjoying a circle&#xD;
of friends and acqna~ancs composed of&#xD;
the Elite of society. ~.&#xD;
The thira was Geor~e Rivington, aged&#xD;
eighteen, a fine, noble youth, a sophomore&#xD;
student of Princeton i~ith his brother&#xD;
Melville, who now held a r~nk in a higher&#xD;
class of studies. The next was Mary.&#xD;
who married Sydenham Van Tuyl, when&#xD;
an her sixteenth year~and irurnediatel)&#xD;
thereafter came to New York to reside&#xD;
with her husband.&#xD;
There were two other children, but a~&#xD;
they had died in the first few hours of their&#xD;
birth. they were nameless, and formed a&#xD;
hiatus of five years, when Harriet and&#xD;
Helen filled the farnLly complement, in&#xD;
- due and regular succession.&#xD;
The measure of Morgan Rivington~~&#xD;
prosperity and happiness was full to over-&#xD;
flowing. There Were few who did not&#xD;
envy him in his wealth and bliss. R&#xD;
gained in consequence, honorand respect,&#xD;
riot indeed because he was rich, but&#xD;
rather because of his urbanity of ma-&#xD;
ners, kindness of heart, and uniform&#xD;
readiness to give his sympathies and his&#xD;
gold to any case of needy distress, or to&#xD;
assist his neighbors and friends in busi-&#xD;
~1css pursuits, or to relieve theta from pe-&#xD;
cuniary embarrassments. He was sini-&#xD;
pie-minded and generous, possessing the&#xD;
&#xD;
~S  LEAGUE.                        69&#xD;
gntleness of the dove, rather than the&#xD;
canning of the serpent. These traits&#xD;
finally made him the prey of designing&#xD;
sharpers~ while many were his losses by&#xD;
the imprudences and want of foresight&#xD;
among the small farmers and mechanics&#xD;
of the neighborhood, whom he had estab-&#xD;
lished in their pursuits ot life. Nor such&#xD;
uncultivated persons alone, honest and&#xD;
well-meaning as they intendeJ to be to&#xD;
their wealthy patron, but the so-called&#xD;
high-born took advantage of his obligix~g&#xD;
and kindly disposition, and paved the way&#xD;
for his own pecuniary embarrassment and&#xD;
ruin altogether. Among these latter gen-&#xD;
try was a gay spendthrift. Prince, who was&#xD;
reckless of the manner he obtained means to&#xD;
.~upport his extravagances in the absence&#xD;
of stated remittances of funds from his fam-&#xD;
ily in Europe.&#xD;
To this lordling and unprincipled onethe&#xD;
worthy Morgan Rivington, loaned money&#xD;
when required, sold fine blood-horses on&#xD;
credit, and assisted in many ways, forget~&#xD;
tiag the Bible injunction, to "put no trust&#xD;
f'rinces." His kindnesses were never&#xD;
repaid; nay, when embarrassments sur-&#xD;
ruuded him, he was unable to recover&#xD;
rhe first dollar, but was rudely repulsed&#xD;
and insulted when he demanded of the&#xD;
nabob his dues and a return of hs loans&#xD;
o him.&#xD;
These things might have been borne&#xD;
with some degree of indifference arid com-&#xD;
posure, had not the very elements of na~&#xD;
tire and the fates of his destiny heaped&#xD;
upon his head troubles and misfortunes in&#xD;
rapid and disastrous succession of each&#xD;
other. He first became seized wfth a&#xD;
mania, which extensively prevailed for&#xD;
planting moms multiceaulus trees, and the&#xD;
rearing of cocoons, with a view to enter..&#xD;

habits, was thrown from a vicious horse and&#xD;
instantly killed. His death was speedily&#xD;
&#xD;
followed by the cutting down, in the glory&#xD;
and beauty of of their lives, of his son-in-&#xD;
law Herbert Waldegrave, his daughter&#xD;
Amelia, and their child, by a terrible pest-&#xD;
- silence which ravaged the world. ~X fe~&#xD;
months subsequent, his only remaining&#xD;
son Georges was also swept to the grave&#xD;
- by consumption. This noble and promh~&#xD;
* ing youth had made the acquaintance of&#xD;
Grenville Ed mondsun, who bees me in con-&#xD;
* sequence a frequent visitor to the planta-&#xD;
tion of hisfather, attracted thither by the&#xD;
general cordiality of the whole family of&#xD;
the venerable and worthy Rivington, and&#xD;
particularly by the rare beauty and sweet-&#xD;
nessof Mary. These visits were first visits&#xD;
of friendship, which friendship ripened&#xD;
speedily into love between the gallant and&#xD;
the you[Ig girl, already blossoming into the&#xD;
glorious maturity of womanhood. They&#xD;
pledged their troth, Sifl(l named the hour&#xD;
when their marriage would take place, on&#xD;
-his rEturn after a cruse of three years on&#xD;
the Pc.cific coast.&#xD;
The family of Rivington was reduced&#xD;
to the parents and three daughters, Mary,&#xD;
the eldest, on the death of her brother&#xD;
George, just entering on her fifteenth&#xD;
year, and her sisters Harriet and Helen&#xD;
five and seven years her junior.&#xD;
Time wore on. A year elapsed, when&#xD;
Mary received intelligence of the death of&#xD;
her gallant lover, while defending the flag&#xD;
of his country, on board of a ship com-&#xD;
manded by thti spirited Commodore Por-&#xD;
ter. The' new~ fell like a thunderbot&#xD;
upon the sensitive nature of the affianced&#xD;
girl, young as she was. She sank into a&#xD;
depth of sorrow and grief which threat-&#xD;
ened spredily to make fearful inroads upon&#xD;
her fragile and delicate constitution. She&#xD;
lost her buoyancy and elasticity of step,&#xD;
wbile her mind becamts enveloped seem-&#xD;
ingly in a pall of melancholy and des-.&#xD;
pondency indicative of mental aberration,&#xD;
&#xD;
or a " mind diseased."&#xD;
A change of scene and society wa&#xD;
deemed essential to her health and hai&#xD;
piness. She was sent to New York an&#xD;
became fhe inmates of a respectable femal&#xD;
boarding'semiriory, located in the environ&#xD;
of the city. The good effect of this move&#xD;
ment was soon perceived. She receive&#xD;
the solicitous attentions of the Principah&#xD;
male and female, and enjoyed, likewise&#xD;
the afflictions and esteem of the numeron&#xD;
and happy maidens, who pursued thei&#xD;
course of studies in the institution. Thesi&#xD;
attentions revived her spirits and rapidly~&#xD;
restored the rose's bloom to her fair lily&#xD;
like cheeks.&#xD;
It was xvhi-le she was at the Seminary&#xD;
that she attended a soiree, ~&amp;amp;t the house o&#xD;
one of the former students, and becoate in&#xD;
produced to Sydcnham Van Tuyl. Hc~&#xD;
extreme beauty and many accomplish&#xD;
ments of mind and manners readily at.&#xD;
traced his attention, when he' profferec&#xD;
her his addresses, pursued her with on or&#xD;
dor of passion that resulted in an offer te&#xD;
her of his hand and fortfine and marriage.&#xD;
Mary, however, resolutely refused all such&#xD;
gallant~ies, thanking him for his regards,&#xD;
but declaring the sacred nature of her&#xD;
feelings in behalf of her departed lover,&#xD;
the gallant lieutenant Edm~ndson. Syden-&#xD;
ham did not seem disposed to yield his&#xD;
point, and pressed her to an engagement of&#xD;
her heart and hand in marriage with all&#xD;
the eloquence and power of the poet and&#xD;
impassioned swain to, the queen of his&#xD;
idolatry and love.&#xD;
To avoid his importunities, she re-&#xD;
turned to the home of her parents arid&#xD;
young sisters, and sought seclusion and&#xD;
peace in their now humble abode, strip-&#xD;
ped as her father had become of his noble&#xD;
mansion and most of the inheritance he had&#xD;
honorably won by his personal l~bor and&#xD;
superintendency of his plantation lands.&#xD;
&#xD;
Here, however, Sydenham pursued her,&#xD;
.s and revealed the state of his feelings to&#xD;
~- her parents, both of whom considered&#xD;
d themselves highly flattered, and readily&#xD;
s.f consented to forward his suit with Mary.&#xD;
a Sycenham generously offered the worthy&#xD;
1'tivington the amplest extent of his purse&#xD;
d to assist the father of his beloved one from&#xD;
;, the embarrassments into which he had&#xD;
, fallen, with a view to the recovery of the&#xD;
a original and hard-won possessions of the&#xD;
prime of his manhood.&#xD;
~   Mary was at length induced to listen to&#xD;
~ the arguments her father urged for her&#xD;
- acceptance of the hand of Sydenham in&#xD;
marriage-her lover's wealth, Lieutenant&#xD;
Edmondson's death, and his own impover-&#xD;
f isbed circumstances of life. These infiu-&#xD;
- ences were too powerful to be resisted;&#xD;
and she finally yielded her hand where&#xD;
- her heart was Dot-sacriheing herself for&#xD;
- the comfort and happiness of her beloved&#xD;
I parents and younger sisters.&#xD;
- Her subsequent career of life, as the&#xD;
I wife of Sydenham Van Tuyl, is already&#xD;
sufficiently well known to the hour of the&#xD;
mysterious death of her bosom compan-&#xD;
ion and school-mate, Ida Wilton, and the&#xD;
* inexplicable absence of her husband,&#xD;
whether by deatlt or otherwise on the&#xD;
* same evening of the terrible tragedy to&#xD;
which allosion has so frequently been&#xD;
made. Being regarded in the light of a&#xD;
harlot, if not a murderess, she returned&#xD;
~once more to the bosom of her parents,&#xD;
who had removed from their country, and&#xD;
occupied the time being by sufferance,&#xD;
an elegant villa in the vicinity of New&#xD;
York, belonging to her absent husband.&#xD;
[here she soon after gave birth to her first&#xD;
child, which was immediately taken from&#xD;
her arms and consigned to the Irish nurse.&#xD;
The old man conceived that he had&#xD;
so'd the honor of his child for gold,&#xD;
and bartered away her h~ppiness for his&#xD;

Truly, the dusky skin, the outre and sooty&#xD;

day and generation are well calculated to&#xD;
inspire ideas of the supernatural and&#xD;

generation, especially among the ignorant&#xD;
and superstitious of the emigrant popula-&#xD;
tion who have never beheld an African&#xD;
form and countenance until their arrival&#xD;
on our shores.&#xD;
"Sweep ho! Sweep ho !" cried Black&#xD;
Raif, in rich and melodious strains during&#xD;
quite a long song appropriate to a i4 ex-&#xD;
pressive of his peculiar calling, occasion-&#xD;
ally branching off into extemporaneous&#xD;
variations of music and words, that gave&#xD;
a very amusing and extraordinary interest&#xD;
to his theme.&#xD;
Suddenly the song of the Dwarf Sweep&#xD;
was interrupted by loud shrieks df some&#xD;
one in distress. RaIf jumped to his feet&#xD;
on the top of the tall chhnney which he&#xD;
had been sweeping, looked keenly around&#xD;
in every direction and held his ear as it to&#xD;
catch more distinctly the sonice of the&#xD;
yoice of the person in peril.&#xD;
"Help! Help! Murder! Murder 1"&#xD;
now came again to his quick and attentive&#xD;
ear, as if of a voice in the distance, or&#xD;
suffering strangulation.&#xD;
He knew the house to be uninhabited&#xD;
upon the chimney of which he stood, and&#xD;
as it was now near noontide of the day, a&#xD;
deed of violence was not likely to occur in&#xD;
the open street, but in the adjoining house&#xD;
of the merchant Arlington. He accord-&#xD;
ingly sprang down and dashed on all&#xD;
fours, along the topmost verge of the s'eep&#xD;
roof of the vacant dwelling, and dumb&#xD;
the chimney of Arlington's house, with&#xD;
&#xD;
the rapidity and agility of a black bear or&#xD;
orange outang.&#xD;
He threw his body across the chimney&#xD;
and thrust his head fairly out of view&#xD;
down the Ilac of the merchant's dwelling.&#xD;
Once more the screams were repeated&#xD;
in a female voice with that dis~nct clear-&#xD;
ness to leave no further doubt ~tience the&#xD;
sound proceeded.&#xD;
"H-e-l-p! H-e-l-p! M-u-r-d-e-r !-&#xD;
M-u.r-d-e-r! M.u-r-" came up through&#xD;
the flue of the chimney with prolonged&#xD;
and terrible agony of accent. It was&#xD;
enough. RaIf instantly realized the em-&#xD;
minent peril of the person who thus so&#xD;
piteously and hopelessly called for aid.&#xD;
Thoughtless and reckless' of danger to&#xD;
himself, his impulsive spirit and generous&#xD;
nature urged him promptly to the succor&#xD;
of the distressed. He darted down the&#xD;
vent w th the rapidity of lightning, and be-&#xD;
held a young and beautiful maiden in the&#xD;
clutches of the monster Arlingtoi~ who&#xD;
had torn the clothing from the breast of *&#xD;
the girl, aud would have succeeded in his&#xD;
salacious and diabolical purposes, if the&#xD;
~weep had not at the very instant provi-&#xD;
dentially interfered to the rescue of Mm-&#xD;
ny Lawson. So excited and inflamed&#xD;
were the vile passions of the libertine, and&#xD;
so intent upon his horrible purpose that he&#xD;
heard nothing of the descent of BaIt&#xD;
through the chimney, nor saw him, until&#xD;
he was pounced upon like a tigress rob-&#xD;
bed of her whelp, and torn by herculean&#xD;
force from the neck of his fair and strug-&#xD;
gling victim. Had the devil made his ap-&#xD;
pearance, Arlington could ~ot have been&#xD;
more alarmed and dumbfounded on the&#xD;
instant, and in the first impulse of his ter-&#xD;
ror he uttered a cry of despair, as of a&#xD;
fiend about to be plunged to the depth of&#xD;
fiery woe, by the gr~t adversary of souls.&#xD;
He, however, quickly discovered that the&#xD;

come to the deliverance of Minny, was ti&#xD;
well known sweep, whose services he hi&#xD;
himself often engaged. His courage r~&#xD;
ta~ned, and with the rage of a villian dE&#xD;
ected in his foul crime, and probably&#xD;
dreading exposure, he demanded&#xD;
"Scoundrel! Wretch! Black imp&#xD;
Hell l Whence came you'? Why this ir&#xD;
trusion in my house! I{ence, begone l c&#xD;
by the foul Friend of Sulphur himself&#xD;

"Not so, Mr. Arlington! Brute! mos&#xD;

great God in Heaven, I will cut the blacl&#xD;
heart from your villainous bosom, and cas&#xD;

U&#xD;
Ralf held the poor girl, who had fallen&#xD;
the second time into a cataleptic condition&#xD;
under one arm, while he brandished a&#xD;
huge knife and kept the libertine at bay.&#xD;
He wheeled backward in the direction of&#xD;
the door, with a view to escape with his&#xD;
precious burthen through the pall of the&#xD;
door.&#xD;
But Arlington was not disposed to be&#xD;
so easily baffled in his purpose, or robbed&#xD;
of 4iis prey. He crowded on Black RaW,&#xD;
with a desperation of purpose that could&#xD;
scarcely be resisted by the rescuer of&#xD;
Minny from the hound of lust.&#xD;
He reached the door and turned the&#xD;
key, and would have darted away with&#xD;
the girl in his arms,~when unfortunately&#xD;
her garments ca t in the lock, and&#xD;
were stripped aim entirely in finders&#xD;
from her lovely and insensible form.&#xD;
'There was now a sudden and terrible cry&#xD;

What would 1 have done'? She is saved&#xD;
-saved from pollution! My child-&#xD;
r my daughter. Take'not away my child!"&#xD;
Suchwild and incomprehensible language&#xD;
filled the heart of l3lack Rail' with no&#xD;
little amazement, mixed with terror. He&#xD;
I-&#xD;
muttered-&#xD;
r ~ understand you not. She is no child&#xD;
~ of yours-no child of yo~irs! Would a&#xD;
father ravish his own child? Never-&#xD;
Back, back! She shall not remain here.&#xD;
I will bear her away. She shall be saved&#xD;

"She shall not be taken hence. She is&#xD;
my child! As God is my witness, she is&#xD;
my only child. I will protect her. She&#xD;
shall not-must not be torn from her fa.&#xD;
their's arms."&#xD;
"Liar! Villain! She cannot be the&#xD;
child of so foul a monster of lust and&#xD;
crime! Back, or perish in sour hellish&#xD;
Arlington heeded not the words ot the&#xD;
powerful negro dwarf, but rushed onward&#xD;
to the restraint of both the gid and her&#xD;
black deliverer. The dwarf finding that&#xD;
his only chance of escape ~vas by maim-&#xD;
ing or killing his white adversar&amp;amp; outright,&#xD;
let slip his long sharp blade, with tremen-&#xD;
dous energy into the bosom of Arlington.&#xD;
[le fell beneath the blow, stunned and&#xD;
bleeding, as from a fatal wound!&#xD;
"Murder! murder! Seize them! Seize&#xD;
hem! Murder l Murder l" were shrieked&#xD;
by Arlington, in such loud and awful&#xD;
tones, that it seemed as if tbe whole city&#xD;
would have been alarmed at the outcries.&#xD;
The knife had struck against Arling-&#xD;
ton's ribs, and glanced obliquely outwardly&#xD;
&#xD;
from his body, without doing farther dan-&#xD;
~er than making a frightful gash athwart&#xD;
the breast, and stunning him completely&#xD;
for a few moments. He quickly sprang&#xD;
to his feet, and darted through the upper&#xD;
hall stairway, in pursuit of Black RaIf.&#xD;
His fearful cries of, murder had speed-&#xD;
ily brought his servants Armand and&#xD;
Margery to the first hall, just as Black&#xD;
Ral~f had gained the inner door or screen&#xD;
near the entrance to the street.&#xD;
Armond instantly comprehended the&#xD;
whole affair, and rushing forward, Inflicted&#xD;
a heavy blow upon the back part of&#xD;
I3lack Ralf's head, which felled him to&#xD;
the floor, insensible and bleeding in&#xD;
death.&#xD;
"Seize the black villain! Bind him&#xD;
hand and foot! Drag' him down to the&#xD;
dark vaults, and let him perish there, and&#xD;
become food for the vermin and the rats!&#xD;
My child !-oh, Margery! She is my'&#xD;
child-my long lost child! Unclasp her&#xD;
from the black skunk's arms. Save her&#xD;
-save her! Oh, let not my dear child&#xD;
perish if there be a spark of' life remain-&#xD;
ing in her body."&#xD;
It was the work of a moment to do the&#xD;
bidding of Arlington.&#xD;
Arn:aad tore the sooty garments from&#xD;
the Sweep, and quickly bound his arms&#xD;
and legs, aud then dragged him by rriain&#xD;
force, as he might have done the dead&#xD;
carcase of a dog, to tte dismal and damp&#xD;
vault, indicated, in the cellars of the build-&#xD;
ing, where he thrust him in, turned the&#xD;
key, and left him utterly to perish.&#xD;
Meanwhile Margery had lifted up the&#xD;
stricken girl, and conveyed her very&#xD;
gently to a bcs.udoir, laid her carefully in a&#xD;
bed, and applied such restoratives as she&#xD;
deemed would speedily restore her from&#xD;
her cataleptic condition, and arouse her&#xD;
to consciousness and life, which now ap-&#xD;
peared entirely suspended1&#xD;
&#xD;
Arlington, exhausted by the struggle&#xD;
with thegirl, and the strife with Black&#xD;
Rslt' threw himself upon a sofa in the&#xD;
parlor, and endeavored to compose him-&#xD;
self aa he was able. in the relaxation of&#xD;
his nerves and mental energies. What&#xD;
his reflections were may probably be irri-&#xD;
agined. They however found no utter-&#xD;
ance in words.&#xD;
At the end of some minutes, Armand&#xD;
entered the room, and reported the luifil-&#xD;
ment of the con mands he had received&#xD;
from his master.&#xD;
"The black imp is secure enough now'&#xD;
I'll warrant me. He will never sing his&#xD;
sweep song upon the housetops again.&#xD;
His soul is already in the devil's clutches,&#xD;
and his black body will soon make a boun-&#xD;

~I'he heartless wretch chuckled a fiend-&#xD;
ish laugh as he spoke.&#xD;
"'Tis well Armand. This affair must&#xD;
be kept a profound secret. You know&#xD;
how deeply you are implicated in this ter-&#xD;
rible business with myself. God knows&#xD;
I anticipated no such results. The young&#xD;
girl whom I would have used to my lust-&#xD;

daughter, the hunocent infant creature&#xD;
whom I spurned front my arms in the first&#xD;
blushing hours of her existence, surrend-&#xD;

to be lost and withdrawn from my gaze&#xD;

but much more wonderful the manner&#xD;
of her deliverance from the polluted coils&#xD;

awaked the echoes of every recess, may&#xD;
have been heard in the streets, As a mat-&#xD;

be removed from hence. This very night&#xD;
you shall take her to my furnished villa&#xD;
on the island, new untenanted, except by&#xD;
your fellow servants, during my absence&#xD;
here in the city. Margery shall accompany&#xD;
you and attend the girl as he r special&#xD;
nurse, till such time as she shall recover&#xD;
and be acknowledged to the world as my&#xD;
first born and only child."&#xD;
"Your word is law with me, and shall&#xD;
be obeyed, to the letter Mr. Arlington."&#xD;
"'Tis well! Call Margery hither, and&#xD;
if she cannot leave the stricken child, re-&#xD;
turn yourself and report her present state&#xD;
of health. A glass of wine first, Armand,&#xD;
then speed you on your errand."&#xD;
His request was instantly obeyed, and&#xD;
Margery made her appearance before the&#xD;
merchant.&#xD;
"How fares the girl, Margery ?"&#xD;
"She is better. She has recovered from&#xD;
her fainting fit, and is now enjoying seem-&#xD;
ingly a refreshing sleep. Strange thing,&#xD;
indeed, that which has come to pass this&#xD;
day, Mr. Arlington. Yeu have fo'tnd your&#xD;
long missing chlld-but--but--.---."&#xD;
"Cease woman. Enougti-.enough. I&#xD;
thank God she remains as pure as the&#xD;
i~ugels in Heaven, and that shc has not&#xD;
been brutally outraged by her own father.&#xD;
It was surely a providential preservation.&#xD;
I own my foul guilt; but my child is&#xD;
spared. She shall have now the fullest&#xD;
sympathies of a repentant father-all the&#xD;
utmost affections of a parent to the tender&#xD;
and lovely child'ot' his consanguinous blood&#xD;
and lone."&#xD;
Arlington then detailed his future plans&#xD;
and bade the woman go and attend the&#xD;
bedside of his daughter, while he retired&#xD;
to his own room for a few hours repose.&#xD;
On that same evening, Minus, in a rap-&#xD;
&#xD;
idly convalescent state, was conveyed to&#xD;
Arlington's country villa, in a boat rowed&#xD;
by Armand, accompanied by Margery, the&#xD;
nurse.&#xD;
CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
WOMAN'S FRAILTY.-A IITJSBAND's JEAL&#xD;
OTJ5Y AND HATIIED!&#xD;
AMONG the young ladies who pursued&#xD;
their studies at Mount Green Female&#xD;
Boarding Seminary, during a part of the&#xD;
term while Mary Rivingron was an inmate&#xD;
of the same institution-was Minerva&#xD;
Raybold, a young 'orphan heiress, from&#xD;
New Orleans, who had been placed in ths&#xD;
care of the Principal, by her Ward, a&#xD;
bachelor uncle, a brother of her mother,&#xD;
and now her only living relative.&#xD;
At the time Mary Rivington first enter-&#xD;
ed the Seminary, Minerva Raybold had&#xD;
been there several years, and was passing&#xD;
through her graduating class. She was&#xD;
now within a few months of attaining the&#xD;
eighteenth year of her age, when she&#xD;
would become legally the mistress of her&#xD;
own conduct and the possessor of the&#xD;
wealth of her ancestors.&#xD;
t3he was a young lady of more than&#xD;
ordinary personal loveliness and brilliance&#xD;
of intellect. Her education was most&#xD;
excellent, embracing the entire range&#xD;
of literature, to which were added all the&#xD;
polite and fashionable accomplishments&#xD;
of the day, including etl~broidery, dancing~&#xD;
music, portrait and landscape painting,&#xD;
and the like. ~he was a creature of re-&#xD;
markable joyousness of spirit-a being&#xD;
in whose countenance beamed happiness&#xD;
and sunshine, seldom or never shaded by&#xD;

with him, although she fondly trusted in his&#xD;
newly married relation with herself, the&#xD;
ardentor of his passion would never again&#xD;
pass beyond the proper bounds of conju-&#xD;
gal restraint.&#xD;
At length a grand entertainment was&#xD;
given by Mrs Arlington. Her gorgeous&#xD;
saloons were thrown open to a large circle&#xD;
of f ishionable acquaintances and friends,&#xD;
among others Sydenham Van Tuyl, un-&#xD;
accompanied by his wife, who ~vas detain-&#xD;
ed at borne by temporary indisposition.&#xD;
There were feasting, music and dancing,&#xD;
and unlimited license to enjoyment for all&#xD;
present. The viands were rich and high-&#xD;
ly spiced, the sparkling wines flowed in&#xD;
very rivers of profusion, while the entire&#xD;
sumptuousness and brilliance of the oc-&#xD;
casion were well calculatedto banish all&#xD;
reserve an~ong the gue~s, to incite reck-&#xD;
lessness of manner, and infisme all the&#xD;
armorous impulses between the sexes. All&#xD;
soon became absorbed in their own pur-&#xD;
suits and passions, men and women par-&#xD;
ticipating in that freedom and licentious-&#xD;
ness of deportment only tole~'ated in the&#xD;
circles of extreme fashionable society.&#xD;
Sydenham Van Toyl soon engaged the&#xD;
beautiful hostess as his partner in a dance&#xD;
amid the whole of the many who spun&#xD;
aroun~l the saloons in all manner of salta-&#xD;
torious evolutions. They were both re&#xD;
inarkably graceful dancers, but as they&#xD;
whirled in the mazy and voluruptuous&#xD;
waltz, their "feats of the light fantastic&#xD;
toe," perhaps neither excited attention nor&#xD;
elicited remark, so intensely were all the&#xD;
gay company absorbed in the merriments&#xD;
and socialites of the evening.&#xD;
Mrs. Arlington had partakeri somewhat&#xD;
freely of wine, the effects of which were&#xD;
quickly perceived by Sydenham, as he&#xD;
held her in his arms in the waltz. Her&#xD;
cheeks became flusired, her bosom heav-&#xD;
ed, either with passion, or else from the&#xD;
&#xD;
heat of the room. Presently she grew&#xD;
giddy, her countenance turned to an ashy&#xD;
paleiies~, and she fell into~ a sickening&#xD;
swoon. Sydenham quickly and qrtite un-&#xD;
perceived led the beautiful woman from&#xD;
the ball room, to a small and secluded&#xD;
boudoir in a rear part of the mansion,&#xD;
which adjourned and opened into a large&#xD;
conservatory, now redolent with the per.&#xD;
fumes ofawilder~css of flowers. He placed&#xD;
her gently on a soft couch, unclasp-&#xD;
ed her waist, and laid bare her bosom,&#xD;
proudly swelling in its snowy and vol-.&#xD;
6umptuous glory. He dashed a cup of&#xD;
water over her face, and~Imrust a bottle of&#xD;
sal almonnia to her nostrils, with a view to&#xD;
her recovery from her fainting condition.&#xD;
Then seized with a strange impulse he&#xD;
sprang to the door and locked himself in&#xD;
the boudoir with the stricken woman.-&#xD;
Here he remained some minutes, when he&#xD;
came out into the conversatory, and per-&#xD;
ceiving Arm and, bade him call one of the&#xD;
female servants to attend his mi~ tress.&#xD;
The ball was over. Arlington arrived at&#xD;
home a few weeks thereafter, and ap-&#xD;
p~ared rather pleased than otherwise that&#xD;
his fair young wife, had so gayly and gen-&#xD;
erously kept up the hospitahities of his&#xD;
house during his absence. He dreamed&#xD;
of nothing, suspected nothing, implicating&#xD;
the purity of his wife. Several months&#xD;
elapsed when he discovered in a drawer of&#xD;
a bureau of his wife's boudoir, a letter&#xD;
scarcely becoming to be retained in the&#xD;
possession of a married woman. It breath-&#xD;
ed a fervency of passion such as only lov-&#xD;
ers might feel in the honied hour of im-&#xD;
passionate suit. To this letter was at-&#xD;
tached a poetical fictions name, while it&#xD;
was without date, ~vhich proved very for-&#xD;
tunate thiu~'s at the time. This armorous&#xD;
billet-doux arrested the attention of Ar&#xD;
hngron, and induced him to examine a&#xD;
number of others that were its compan-&#xD;

ions in the drawer. They were gener-&#xD;
ally letters of friendship from her ac-&#xD;
quaintances, and her uncle, with some&#xD;
few of a more tender character, that had&#xD;
been addressed to her by gallants who&#xD;
had sought to win her for a lride. They&#xD;
bore dates~ and proper signatures which&#xD;
left no doubt of having been received by&#xD;
his wife in an honorable way prior to his&#xD;
marriage with her.&#xD;
His suspicions were excited. This let-&#xD;
ter was in the handwriting of Sydenham&#xD;
Van Tuyl, which he had abundant evi-&#xD;
dence of knowing by comparing the cali&#xD;
graphy of the letters and papers of his part-&#xD;
ner in mercantile affairs. His wife's rotun-&#xD;
dity of form, indicated that she would&#xD;
shortly give birth to a child. Lie realized&#xD;
that a year had passed without her giv-&#xD;
ing the slightest signs of maternity. He&#xD;
thought of his absence of some months&#xD;
leaving her exposed to all the tempta-&#xD;
tions of licentious society. His bosom&#xD;
was filled with doubt. The more he&#xD;
doubted and reflected the more convinced&#xD;
he became of his wife's infidelity. He could&#xD;
containhis suspicions no longer He produc-&#xD;
ed the fatal document and angrily charged&#xD;
the crime of adultery upon her. A violent&#xD;
quarrel was the result of her assertion of&#xD;
innocence. He would not however be&#xD;
satisfied. He questioned his servants con-&#xD;
cerning her private habits during his long&#xD;
absence from home. The revelations that&#xD;
were made, were not calculated to re-&#xD;
lieve the uneasiness of mind under which&#xD;
he labored. Nay, the proofs of his wife's&#xD;
guilt were clear and abundant. Armand&#xD;
related the suspicious circumstances of the&#xD;
grand ball, when Van Tuyl was seen to&#xD;
come forth from the private chamber of&#xD;
Mr . Arlington. Abby Somers, the spe-&#xD;
cial maid, confirmed Armand's statement,&#xD;
and detailed the peculiar position in which&#xD;
she had found the young wife.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mrs. Arlington kept herself in ab-&#xD;
solute seclusion in the house of her hus-&#xD;
band, during her pregnancy. Her death&#xD;
was duly proclaimed, but the knowledge&#xD;
of having given birth to a child was kept&#xD;
a secret from the world. The mid-wife&#xD;
whp officiated at her accouchment, was&#xD;
the old Mother O~Hara. The event took&#xD;
place during the same day, and within a&#xD;
few hours after her return home from the&#xD;
strange and mysterious ~iirth-bed of the&#xD;
unknown darkly veiled lady of the gor-&#xD;
ge9us mansion, whose location was also&#xD;
unknown to her, somewhere over the&#xD;
water, on the dread night of the terrible&#xD;
snow storm.&#xD;
It was a strange coincidence. She re-&#xD;
ceived from the dying wife of Arlington a&#xD;
purse of gold and a gold ring of precisely&#xD;
the same pattern and the same initials M.&#xD;
U. engraved on the inner rim. The babe&#xD;
was also a female child, but yielded by its&#xD;
mother to the midwife with many bles-&#xD;
sings on its innocent head, and repeated&#xD;
injunctions to the nurse to guard and pro-&#xD;
tect it through its career 4.of life. Tbe&#xD;
babe was accordingly taken from her by&#xD;
the mid wife, and conveyed to her humble&#xD;
home. It was, however, a very fragile&#xD;
thing, and died almost on the instant of&#xD;
her return to her dwelling. She buried it&#xD;
secretly in the earth of her cellar, and kept&#xD;
her secret from all of mortal kind except&#xD;
her daughter Norab. That very night&#xD;
the child of mysterious origin, with the&#xD;
mark of the black snake on her heart, was&#xD;
taken to the cottage home of Lawson, on&#xD;
the banks of the Harlem river, as hereto-&#xD;
fore narrated.&#xD;
She continued to receive an annual&#xD;
sum of money from the merchant Arling-&#xD;
tonfor its support, making him believe&#xD;
that his wife's child, (for he would not call&#xD;
it his own) lived in the home of the&#xD;
gardener's cottage. Several years pass-&#xD;

"Go on) Armand. Tell me all in your&#xD;

"Well then, Margery, I will first state&#xD;
the way I became acquainted with Ar-&#xD;
lingtnn. It was about sixteen years ago,&#xD;
when all Europe ~ias convulsed by the&#xD;
wars of the great Napoleon Bonaparte,&#xD;
who tumbled over kings and rulers, like so&#xD;
many nine-pins, and partitioned off many&#xD;
kingdoms in order to give his brothers&#xD;
and relatives each a separate throne from&#xD;
which to rule the conquered people of the&#xD;
various nations of the Cor4inent. Lewis&#xD;
Bonaparte having been made King of Liol-&#xD;
land, th~ Duke of Brunswick was dispos-&#xD;
5e55e(l of his territories, and resided for&#xD;
the time being in London. In his absence&#xD;
~Pririee of that house, intvhose service&#xD;

and other valuable treasures of the Duke-&#xD;
'do~n, and secreted the bulk of them in&#xD;

Prince, and lavished his wealth in bound-&#xD;
less profusion upon a ~~ig I~reneh wo;&#xD;
mat', wife of a Colonel i~~th~ French&#xD;
Army, then residing at Amsterdam, where&#xD;
Mr. Arlington had a ~hig. ~akfDg in a&#xD;
cargo of goods fot~ ~e United States. I&#xD;
became cognizant of the robbery of the&#xD;
jewels by the young Prince, my master,&#xD;
and seeing that he ~vould be likely to lay-&#xD;
ibh all of the t:easiirethat could be~read-&#xD;
ily converted to use, without detection,&#xD;
upon his paramour, I resolved to~ secure&#xD;
the treasure for myself and make my&#xD;
escape to the United States. I secured&#xD;
my prize, and then I thought of the best&#xD;
manner of having the same conveyed&#xD;
across the" Atlantic without a discovery&#xD;

being made. Meanwhile, the Prince and&#xD;
hia paramour quarrelled and separated,&#xD;
when she retuned to Paris, and became&#xD;
the mistress of St. Pierre do Reney, an&#xD;
artificer in gold and silver, who quickly&#xD;
converted several of the crowh ornaments&#xD;
given to thr~ Prince's paramour, into ele-&#xD;
gant manufactured bijouterie, so as to&#xD;
leave no trace by which their previous&#xD;
form could be identified. I applied to&#xD;
Arlington and informed him in regard to&#xD;
the stolen jewels, and offered to give him&#xD;
half their value if he would undertake to&#xD;
smug~1e the other half and nih'c me as a&#xD;
passenger in his slip to New York.&#xD;
"At first lie indignantly spu-ned the&#xD;
proposition, and threatened to turn me&#xD;
over at once for punishment to the au.&#xD;
authorities of the country. I loll on my&#xD;
knees and implored him in lie i~nost ear&#xD;
nest and tearful manner not to expose riiy&#xD;
crimes-that I woul(l surrender him the&#xD;
entire treasure in my possession, and bind&#xD;
myself to him as his slave ior life.&#xD;
"After some show of determination to&#xD;
hand me over to justice, his cupidity he~&#xD;
came excited, and he suddejiTy relented,&#xD;
and saVe m~ to understand that if I&#xD;
would plac~ tbe treasures in hs hands he&#xD;
would agre~ to my oroposilion, and take&#xD;
the jew4~ ~nd myself. to the United&#xD;
States, until Aich opportunity should arise&#xD;
for the restori~tion of the treasure to the&#xD;
proper owners. lie made me submit to&#xD;
be hand~ufi'ed on the spot lest I should&#xD;
o~o~pe, ~vhtte he confinetl me in a Secret&#xD;
part of his ship till the vessel should sail&#xD;
from Amsterdam. Though the treasures&#xD;
were not very bulky, some of them being&#xD;
diamonds~ 1 had them all secreted in little&#xD;
bags about my person, beneath my draw-&#xD;
ers and shirt. Just before thb ship sailed&#xD;
I was put into a gin ho~shead half filed&#xD;
with water, and in that position remained&#xD;
discoveredrd until fairly out at tea, when&#xD;
&#xD;
I was taken out and required to emp~oy&#xD;
myself as one of ilid hands of the ship-&#xD;
The vessel was placed under the com'&#xD;
mand of the first officer, who was to take&#xD;
her to Havre and there await for Ca~&#xD;
tin Arlington to come on board on his re~&#xD;
turn to the United States.&#xD;
"Meanwhile he travelled overland to&#xD;
Paris, and immediately sought out the&#xD;
place of Reney the jeweller, and obtained&#xD;
an interview with hIS niistress, which ir~&#xD;
terview resulted in the ~ desertion&#xD;
of Reriey and coming to New York as&#xD;
the paramour of Arlington. Here Ar&#xD;
linglon gave up his ship and entered into&#xD;
partnership with Sydenham Van Tn3 I, in&#xD;
the shipping and importing trade, living&#xD;
in much apparent haimnony with his mie~&#xD;
,tress for several months, when he admirv&#xD;
istered a dose ~f poison which destroyed&#xD;
her life. lie then gave oat that she had&#xD;
coainmitted suicide, and so averted suspi-&#xD;
cion from himself as her murderer.&#xD;
"I was-Very ignorant of almost every&#xD;
thing, when I fir~t phoed myself into the&#xD;
power of Arlington, but whmen~tLe woman&#xD;
died I readily comprehended that w e were&#xD;
both guilty of crime, and by a tacit un~&#xD;
derstanding between ourselves, under the&#xD;
necessity of becoming attached to each&#xD;
other, ~with a view to the preservation of&#xD;
oul' respective secrets fiomn the eyes of&#xD;

'Yes, in point of fact, but not his wilful&#xD;
murderer. I had hoped that Thornton&#xD;
and Sydenham had fallen beneath one&#xD;
another's deadly blcws; but as I had my&#xD;
instructions from Arlington to make&#xD;

TilE CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
JOLLY BOATMAN TAYERN-THE&#xD;
LEAGUE OF OUTLAws.&#xD;
MEANWHILE Margery repaired to the&#xD;
house of William Burton, the hadlord of&#xD;
"The Jolly Boatman," and held a scc~ret'&#xD;
and long comn~inication with his wife, to&#xD;
whom the reader has been already intro-&#xD;
duced under her maiden name of hannah&#xD;
Somtners.&#xD;
"The Jolly Boatman" tavern ~was situ-&#xD;
ated on the banks ot the llwdson, at a&#xD;
place then well known as the Chelsea&#xD;
Shad Fishery Landing. Jfk keeper, W~l.&#xD;
ham Burton, was one of the parties who&#xD;
as~istcc~ Wilkins in conveying the coffin&#xD;
&#xD;
of jewelry to Potter's Field, and there&#xD;
burying it, in sight of George Lawson,&#xD;
who remained in r~mbush, and believed&#xD;
they had placed in the grave the murder-&#xD;
ed remains of his sister Minny.&#xD;
It will be remembered that Burton left&#xD;
the Field aiid went away with the coach-&#xD;
man while Wilkins remained with the&#xD;
grave-digger until he had seen the earth&#xD;
tilled in over the coffin, and the grave&#xD;
properly made up.&#xD;
It ~tas Wilkins' intention when this&#xD;
*&#xD;
was accomplished, to follow Btirton to his&#xD;
alehouse; and hence his invitation~ to old&#xD;
Phihlip to accompany him and participate&#xD;
in so&amp;amp;e jolhification which was corning&#xD;
off in ~at quarter, on that evening. His&#xD;
intention, however, was frustrated by&#xD;
George La'vson, who forced him to the&#xD;
house of Col. Bumrcll, where the scene of&#xD;
violence took place that resulted in the&#xD;
death of the supposed libertine, seducer&#xD;
~nd murderer of Minny Lawson.&#xD;
It will now be necessary to give some&#xD;
particulars respecting 'The Jolly Boat-&#xD;
man" tavern, its keepers, inmates, arid the&#xD;
general purposes for which it was used.&#xD;
And first, in regard to the history and&#xD;
character of Burton and his wife.&#xD;
Many of our elderly readers must well&#xD;
remember the time of the large emigra-&#xD;
tion zof people from Holland and the&#xD;
Netherlands, during the ~eams when the&#xD;
wars of Napoleon convulsed Europe to its&#xD;
very centre. Many of these emigrants&#xD;
were very ignorant and very boorish, and&#xD;
being in extremely impoverished circum-&#xD;
stanceswere too glad to avail themselves of&#xD;
any way of escape from lands overrun by&#xD;
armies and desolated by the sword. Ac-&#xD;
ccA'dingly, to secure their transportation to&#xD;
a home of peace and plenty, it became&#xD;
quite a common thing for whole ship&#xD;
loads of people to come to the United&#xD;
States, u~on~ the agreement of binding&#xD;
&#xD;
themselves for a term of years under a&#xD;
species of slavery, or voluntary servitude,&#xD;
in payment of the expense of their pro-&#xD;
Visions and passage across the Atlantic to&#xD;
our shores. These emigrants were called&#xD;
at the time, "Dutch Redemptionists," the&#xD;
majority of whom found ready employ-&#xD;
ment and comfortable homes in the bosom&#xD;
of American and other families all over&#xD;
the Confederacy, upon the terms of serf-&#xD;
dom to which reference has been made.&#xD;
Among those ~iRedernptionists" who&#xD;
came over in one of Arlington's vessels,&#xD;
were a lusty and flne-lookin~ young man,&#xD;
and a healthy. rosy-checked lass, both, at&#xD;
the time, in the eighteenth year of t ieir&#xD;
ages. These the merchant Arlington&#xD;
took into 'his own employment, changing&#xD;
their unpronounoable names ,oranglocizing&#xD;
them to those of William l3urton and I-Ian-&#xD;
nah Sommers. He retained Burton about&#xD;
his warehouse and the shippingwhile Han-&#xD;
nah Summers officiated at first among the&#xD;
lower domestics in his family household~&#xD;
From this position Hannah rapidly rose in&#xD;
favqr with Mrs Arlington, and finally be-&#xD;
came her special personal servant and&#xD;
tiring maid. She was rather a comely&#xD;
and tidy girl, and withal sprightly and&#xD;
intelligent, and filled her new station with&#xD;
complete satisfaction to her young and&#xD;
lovely mistress. In fact, Mrs. Arlington&#xD;
gave the girl her fullest confidence-alas!&#xD;
to have such tokens of regard repaid by her&#xD;
becoming the dupe of Arlington and he-&#xD;
trayi ug those suspicous circumstances&#xD;
whi~h led eventually to the violent rup-&#xD;
ture between himself and his wife, ~by&#xD;
which he east her from his bosom as the&#xD;
weakest of women and the impurest of&#xD;
wives.&#xD;
Such was the inconsistency of Arling-&#xD;
ton's nature, his unrelenting bate and&#xD;
rankest hypocrisy, that at the very period&#xD;
while he was holding adulterous relations&#xD;
&#xD;
with hannah Sommers, he sought to repu-&#xD;
diate his wife and 'her promised chili!,&#xD;
because of her suspected and aIle~ed&#xD;
criminality with Sydenham Van Tuvi,&#xD;
relying solely upon the words of his&#xD;
bought and hired menial for the false-ev.&#xD;
dence by which to substantiate the guilt&#xD;
of his really immaculate, beautiful and&#xD;
accomplished wife,~ thereby literally&#xD;
hunting her down by such foul calumnies&#xD;
to~ her grave of sorrow and shame.&#xD;
This being the position of Willi~m Bur-&#xD;
ton and hannah Summers, in Arlington's&#xD;
household, the latter found no difficulty in&#xD;
bringing about a marriage between the&#xD;
t~vain servants-bribing Burton to either&#xD;
the expectant fruit of Arlington's liaison&#xD;
with Hannah, when presented to her&#xD;
husband after her accouchement should&#xD;
take place.&#xD;
What with money and other favors be&#xD;
stowed on Burton and [hannah from time to&#xD;
time, Arhngton effectually won them over&#xD;
and retained them ever in liu intere~t.&#xD;
He set Barton up in the ale house of ' Tne&#xD;
Jolly Boatman," and looked upon him as&#xD;
~xcIusively in his own employment, what-&#xD;
ever way Burton was seemingly employed&#xD;
on 'As own private account. Burton, ac-&#xD;
~ordingly, frequently became engaged in&#xD;
the [more daring speculations of Arling-&#xD;
ton, whether in smuggling, privateering,&#xD;
or the African slave trade. It was there-&#xD;
fore the extreme of polif~y for Arlington to&#xD;

eyes of the world, whatever his rogueries&#xD;
and villainies. Alas! for poor human&#xD;
nature, he found persons ready enough to&#xD;
shield his crimes and even suffer punish-&#xD;
ment for them, through the largesses of his'&#xD;
ample wealth. Among these, Bprton and&#xD;
Hannah continued to remain the most de-&#xD;
voted and steadfast of his tools. It is not&#xD;
surprising, from what has been related of&#xD;
the principles and characters of Burton&#xD;

and his wife, that "The Jolly Boatman"&#xD;
tavern soon became the resort for the&#xD;
most depraved and wicked of iiuw~n so-&#xD;
ciety. In fact, the house was the rendez-&#xD;
vous of thieves and outlaws of every&#xD;
name, of both sexes-at onoc a low drink-&#xD;

o depa eat ions corn mltte(l, and aiding&#xD;

came a resorE of such infamous character&#xD;
as to be held ira dread by the circumspect&#xD;
and prudent of the citizens generally&#xD;
while even the Police rarely dared to pen-&#xD;

and horrid of orgies were constantly be-&#xD;

K&#xD;
whatever the crimes and (lisorders com-&#xD;

"place of refuge" for murderers and vil-&#xD;
lairas of every order, who, when hotly&#xD;
pursued, found means of' concealment or&#xD;
escape through the ale house by certain&#xD;
mysterious facilities that for a long series&#xD;
of years remained undiscovered.&#xD;

circumstances of vicious ~nd corrupt life,&#xD;

manner of crimes, manyof the subordi-&#xD;
nates in a-nch diablerie' were not less&#xD;
eagerly engaged in taking s~ cret advan-&#xD;
tage of their employers' weaknesses,&#xD;
vices and crimes, to the aeooml)lishment&#xD;
of thdr own private designs and pecuni-&#xD;
ary emoumeuts. Each man and wom~n&#xD;
&amp;amp;eemed to play at cross-purposes, and.&#xD;
wcakd for their individual selves, though&#xD;
bound by the very nature of their crimes&#xD;
in a tort of general league for the advan-&#xD;
tage of the entire community of outlaws.&#xD;
The salacious prQpensities of Arlington&#xD;
and Burrell especially, were well known&#xD;
to Armand and Wilkins, who were the&#xD;
confidential ,servants respectively of the&#xD;
lawyer and the merchant.&#xD;
These men not only hunted their prey&#xD;
like hounds in couple, but sought through&#xD;
the instrumentality of their favorite me-&#xD;
nials, such dainty morsels of virginal.&#xD;
sweetness, -as would be most likely to sti-&#xD;
mulate to the utmost degree their luxuri-&#xD;
ous appetites. These panderings to their&#xD;
lustful purposes were always liberally&#xD;
paid for, by a douceur equal~ to the risk&#xD;
involved in decoying the innocent and&#xD;
helpless victims into the snares of the ae~&#xD;
ducer an4 destroyer.&#xD;
&#xD;
We know the manner in which Minray 1&#xD;
Lawson was inveigled into the meshes of&#xD;
Arlington, and the way she escaped from&#xD;
his villainous designs, and her subsequent 1&#xD;
disappearance from his island villa.&#xD;
What Armand had designed to accom-&#xD;
plish for his master, a similar purpose&#xD;
was carried forward under scarce less&#xD;
perilous circumstances, through the im-&#xD;
mediate instrumentality of Wilkins-al-&#xD;
though each case of villainy resulted ad&#xD;
rnirably to the temporary advantage of&#xD;
the pEtters, among whom Armand, Wil-&#xD;
kins, Margery, Burton, his wife, her&#xD;
daughter Sarah or Sally, were the princi-&#xD;
pals.&#xD;
&#xD;
of the house of Arlington and that of&#xD;
Burrell, by which means a passage was&#xD;
ojkned from the wine vaults of each&#xD;
house to the sewer. These apertures&#xD;
were kept cmcealed, by placing empty&#xD;
casks in their fronts inside of the vaults.&#xD;
As already intimated, Arlington and&#xD;
Burrell were given to turns of wine-drink-&#xD;
ing and debapch, in company together.&#xD;
On these occasions they allowed free in-&#xD;
(lulgence to their animal and sensual na-&#xD;
tures, and became reckless of the manner&#xD;
in which tacir diabolical appetites were&#xD;
appeased. It, however, must be under-&#xD;
stood, that they were both extremely fas-&#xD;
tidious and choice in the selection of the&#xD;

ordinary precociousness, and remarkable&#xD;

virgin and prude with a degree of modesty&#xD;
and innocence, that those who did not&#xD;
know of her wantonness of character,&#xD;
would have hardly believed simulated or&#xD;
put on for the occasion. Her peculiar&#xD;
beauty, fullness of figure, rare sweetness&#xD;
of voice, modest demeanor, added to her&#xD;
neat and tidy garb, were well calculated&#xD;
to excite the amoxous impulses even in&#xD;
the bosom of an anchorite, much more in&#xD;
the hot breast of the professed libertine&#xD;
and sensuia.4&#xD;
Burrell, at the time the girl was intro-&#xD;
duced into his chamber, was reclining on&#xD;
a~ couch in a semi state yf inebriation.&#xD;
ifrom a secret signal made to him by&#xD;
Wilkins, he readily understood that she&#xD;
was a lamb designed for the slaughter.&#xD;
He slowly rose to a recumbent position on&#xD;
he couch, bade the girl approach and&#xD;
show him her luscious berries while his&#xD;
servant should fetch a dish for their re-&#xD;
ception when purchased. Froln pricing&#xD;
and tasting the finest of the fruit, he be-&#xD;
gan his flatteries, by comparing their&#xD;
sweetness and color to the hobey and&#xD;
roses of her dewy lips. He gradually&#xD;
progressed with such familiarities, with a&#xD;
view to win her confidence, till he fancied&#xD;
she was ready to fall quite readily beneath&#xD;
his licentious appliances. He suddenly&#xD;
drew her to his embraces, and attempted&#xD;
to kiss herlips. The girl appeared un-&#xD;
suspicious of his evil purposes, while her&#xD;
apparent artlessness and innocence but&#xD;
further tended to inflame the passions of&#xD;
the libertine lawyer. It was not till he&#xD;
attempted to snatch the kiss, that she&#xD;
seemed to comprehend that she was with-&#xD;
in the toils of an unprincipled seducer.&#xD;
~he quickly tore away from his lustful&#xD;
arms, shrieked for help, and flew to the&#xD;
door as it wishing to escape from the&#xD;
room.&#xD;
&#xD;
This movement excited the salacious&#xD;
flame in J3urrell's bosom to the last de-&#xD;
gree, and caused him to follow her and&#xD;
secure by force what he coulditot other-&#xD;
wise obtain. Again he seized her, but&#xD;
reeling in his nervousness from the excite-&#xD;
ment and effect of his semi-debauch, he&#xD;
staggered toward the wall. This lurch&#xD;
broke his hold on the girl, when she rush-&#xD;
ed to the toilet-table, seized a dagger&#xD;
blade there purposely placed by Wilains,&#xD;
and inflicted a terrible gash athwart her&#xD;
throat. She fell to the floor, apparently&#xD;
bleeding profusely from the wounds, and&#xD;
lay gasping as if in the last moments of&#xD;
her life.&#xD;
Wilkins, who was an eager listener of&#xD;
what was transpiring within, broke into&#xD;
the room, caught the girl to bear her to&#xD;
a remote part of the house, as if to silence&#xD;
her cries of murder. He appeared seem-&#xD;
ingly, himself, in the highest state of&#xD;
alarm, in consequence of the tragedy&#xD;
which had occurred.&#xD;
"Yan have murdered her, Colonel 1~ur.&#xD;
rell l The murder will be found out!&#xD;
We will both be hung on the gallows!&#xD;
Oh my Gd ! what shall be done? Let&#xD;
me take her away, Mr. Burrell. She&#xD;
must not remain here. The people will&#xD;
be rushing in from the street-the murder&#xD;
will be discovered, and we shall be made&#xD;
to swing for it, Mr. Rurrell !"&#xD;
His outcries and lamentations, combin-&#xD;
ing alarm and a wish to hide away all&#xD;
evidence of the tragic affair, penetrated&#xD;
the callous and insensible heart of the&#xD;
libertine. It was the first time, perhaps,&#xD;
that the tender emotions of pity and aym-&#xD;
pathy ever filled his bosom, in view of the&#xD;
distresses and afflictions of any fellow hu-&#xD;
man being. He could but ejaculate:&#xD;
"Do what you think best in the mat-&#xD;
ter, Wilkins. Save the girl's life, if you&#xD;
can. It she die, we must bury her se-&#xD;
&#xD;
cretly. You shall have what gold you&#xD;
want, but let me not be implicated, on&#xD;
any account, in the unfortunate ~&#xD;
"Depend upon me, she shall be saved&#xD;
if it be possible. If she die, I alone will&#xD;
be her murderer; but you shall save me&#xD;
from the gallows, sir l"&#xD;
Sc~me time elapsed, when Wilkins re-&#xD;
ported to his mer that the girl was&#xD;
dead.&#xD;
"Well, well ! there is no help for it&#xD;
no~v. There, take that purse, procure a&#xD;
coffi,, and convey her remains to Potter's&#xD;
Field with such secrecy and despatch as&#xD;
you may be able."&#xD;
"It shall be done! Your commands&#xD;
shall be obeyed to the vcry letter, Mr.&#xD;
Burrelh"&#xD;
The libertine strove to banish the affair&#xD;
from his mind, and did not trouble himself&#xD;
with auy arrangements for herinterment,&#xD;
nor see the girl's form after Wilkins re-&#xD;
ported that she was no more.&#xD;
The stratagem was entirely successful.&#xD;
The seemingly terrible tragedy proved in&#xD;
fact a mo3t ludicrous affair. Wilkins and&#xD;
the girl were capital actors. They per-&#xD;
formed their parts in this thir own pri-&#xD;
vate drama, with a cleverness worthy of&#xD;
the most experienced on the mimic&#xD;
boards -indeed wi~th that faithful imita-&#xD;
ion befitting the stern realities of life&#xD;
The girl had escaped scratch and wour~d&#xD;
entirely . The seeming bhjol which flow-&#xD;
d from her throat and stained her gar-&#xD;
ments, was but the juice of the handful&#xD;
f strawberries, which she had su(ldenly&#xD;
(rushed in her hands, and therewith be-&#xD;
nieated her throat, so as to resemble the&#xD;
f~ightlul-looking gash which the bewil-&#xD;
('ered ~urrell supposed to have been in-&#xD;
I icted by the dagger-blade. The girl was&#xD;
secretly conveyed from the house, and&#xD;

CHAPTER XXI[.&#xD;
THE PICTURE GALLERY.-STARTLING AND&#xD;
AFFECTING REVELATIONS.&#xD;
THE morning of the murder of Col.&#xD;
Burrell and the discovery ~f th coffin&#xD;
filled with plate and jewels by the s a&#xD;
C Esculapius, in their Anatomical theatre,&#xD;
but before such occurrences had been cx.&#xD;
ensively rumored in the community, three&#xD;
persons, two men and the other a very&#xD;
aged woman, were seen sitting together in&#xD;
a sumptuously furnished apartment nif the&#xD;
villa, which Armond anl Margery had&#xD;
abandoned in alarm on the day previous,&#xD;
:n constq'1e~ee of the upparation of the&#xD;
murdered Sydenham Van Thy!, and also&#xD;
on acc~'unt of the spiriting away of the&#xD;
stricken Minny from the old habitation&#xD;
by some mysterious agency to them un-&#xD;
known.&#xD;
These parties were Captain Van Vetch-&#xD;
en, Conradin Van Tuyl, and the Red&#xD;
Witch of Weehawken. They had long&#xD;
conversed respecting the affairs of the&#xD;
several members of the Van Tuyl family&#xD;
and their vast estates, which had become&#xD;
involved in considerable confusion in the&#xD;
mysterious absence of Sydenham Van&#xD;
Tuyl and the sudden death of his aged&#xD;
father.&#xD;
The Witch was able, as it appeared, to&#xD;
throw much light upon tile whole matter.&#xD;
Her profession of Fortune Teller placed&#xD;
her in a position to learn~ something of&#xD;
almost every strange and mysterious pro-&#xD;
ceeding in Society, through the medium&#xD;
of those parties, in all ranks~of life, who&#xD;
sought her~inte;pretation of Ili r fortunes&#xD;
and destinies.&#xD;

&#xD;
The Witch finished her revelations,&#xD;
whatever they were, and then remarked:&#xD;
"Now, gentlemen, to confirm more&#xD;
clearly, the facts which I have imparted,&#xD;
it remains for me to present to you such&#xD;
occular proofs as must re~nove com-&#xD;
pletely every doubt from your mind -&#xD;
In hither, gentlemen, to this Picture Gal-&#xD;
lery, and let me explain something of the&#xD;
history of a number of portraits which&#xD;
cover these walls."&#xD;
She drew back a panel that the gentle.&#xD;
men had not perceived before, and enter-&#xD;
ed a long gallery of Paintings and Statu-&#xD;
ary, followed by the two gentlemen who&#xD;
had consulted her oracular wisdom.&#xD;
The witch, then, taking up a long ta-&#xD;
pering wand, from its hook against the&#xD;
wall, proceeded to give a brief history of&#xD;
the Gallery and to point out the charac-&#xD;
teristics of a number of paintings. Ad.&#xD;
dressing herself to Coniadin, she remark,&#xD;
ed&#xD;
"This villa, you of course, are aware&#xD;
was built by your. grandfather Van Tayl,&#xD;
and that this gallery of paintings was&#xD;
originally instituted by him 1"&#xD;
"Certainly, I have been informed by&#xD;
my departed relatives of this fact."&#xD;
"As I supposed you had. Well, you&#xD;
here find some ef the rarest productions&#xD;
of t!e glorious art in the world-cltef&#xD;
d'ouvres by the greatest masters in all~&#xD;
lands. 'This series of portraits here, are&#xD;
by the illustrious West, of your own&#xD;
cour~try, and are intended to represent the&#xD;
heads and the several branches of your&#xD;
family. There two are likenesses of your&#xD;
grand father and grandmother. These&#xD;
are their children-this your uncle Syden-&#xD;
ham Van Tayl, this your father j~ouis&#xD;
Van Tuyl, and that child portrait, the&#xD;
counterfeit presentment" of your uncle&#xD;
John Jacob Van Tuyl, who was unaccount.&#xD;
&#xD;
upon the sixth year of his age. These la-&#xD;
dies are your mother and Mary Rivington,&#xD;
wife of your uncle Sydenham, while this&#xD;
boy portrait was designed to represent&#xD;
yourself, -Conradin, when you were in&#xD;
your fourteenth year, although time has&#xD;
so wrought upon you, that it would now&#xD;
hardly be suspected that such is the&#xD;
fact]'&#xD;
"Oh, I remember well, when I sat for&#xD;
the picture. My father and mother were&#xD;
then both dead, and I was living with my&#xD;
grandfather and uncle Sydenham, in&#xD;
their city mansion. Uncle had his own&#xD;
jikeness, Aunt Mary's and mine, taken at&#xD;
the same time. Oh, my poor Aunt Mary!&#xD;
I recollect her as if she had left her home&#xD;
only yesterday. That picture is so much&#xD;
like as she looked. Those meek but ex-&#xD;
pressive eyes, that sweet angelic counte-&#xD;
nance, those ripe, speaking lips every&#xD;
attribute of her surpassing loveliness; all&#xD;
are here distinctly portrayed. And she&#xD;
was as good as ~he was beautiful I Oh,&#xD;
how I loved her, and how I mourned&#xD;
when reproach came upon her purity; but&#xD;
I never-never believed a word of the&#xD;
foul calumnies that were shamefully heap-&#xD;
ed upon her head. She could not have&#xD;
been, guilty of' dishonor, much - less con-&#xD;
cerned in the murder of her husband !"&#xD;
The witch gave a sudden start, some&#xD;
strange emotion seized her bosom', she&#xD;
turned her face and brushed away a gush-&#xD;
ing tear, which sparkled like a jewel as it&#xD;
'rolled down her withered' and saffron&#xD;
cheeks. Quickly, however, regaining&#xD;
her composure, she proceeded&#xD;
"You are right, Conradin, in your am&#xD;
preciation of the character of your poor&#xD;
stricken Aunt Mary. She was guiltless&#xD;
of any wrong to either Sydenham or any&#xD;
of her husband's family as the innocent&#xD;
&#xD;
ably lost to his family, when just ergered f babe unborn."&#xD;
&#xD;
"And you knew her, then, Maria De&#xD;
Vaux ?"&#xD;
"Yes, very intimately. I was familiar&#xD;
with evety sentiment of her bosom, and&#xD;
was cognizant of her entire line of con-&#xD;
duct from her earliest childhood through&#xD;
all her life. If she ever cherished a harsh&#xD;
feeling toward her husband, it was when&#xD;
she became the defamed outcast, as she&#xD;
supposed, through his unjust suspicions&#xD;
and instrumentality of retaliation of her&#xD;
alleged infidelity to him."&#xD;
"Oh, how glad I am to hear you speak&#xD;
thus of my dear, long missing Aunt I&#xD;
Would that I knew of her fate-whether&#xD;
she be in the land of the living or dead."&#xD;
"S'e lives l~'&#xD;
"She lives? Would to God I might&#xD;
again behold her on earth !"&#xD;
"I am able to bring about the interview&#xD;
you desire, Conradin I"&#xD;
"Say you so? Oh, let me meet her again&#xD;
face to face, and I would be willing to&#xD;
surrender to her all the inheritances of the&#xD;
Van Toyl family, the last of, the race&#xD;
that I am, as some recompense for the&#xD;
foul wrongs which have been done to&#xD;
her fame by 'her connection with our&#xD;
name !"&#xD;
"If you ~vLh, Conradin, you may see&#xD;
your Aunt this very day."&#xD;
"This' very day? When? Where P&#xD;
"Here 'in ttiis villa! And before the&#xD;
dining hour !"&#xD;
'God of Heaven! Can this be 'possi-&#xD;
b'le? What bliss is yet in store for me,&#xD;
in recompense for the sorrows which'have&#xD;
literally overwhelmed my soul these man"&#xD;
long years past!&#xD;
"The Sculptures say "that the crooked&#xD;
ways shall be made straight,"~and that&#xD;
"light shall come 9ut of darkness." Be&#xD;
at peace, Conradin, your hour of happi-&#xD;
ness is already at hand."&#xD;
&#xD;
"So I trust and hope may be the case."&#xD;
The witch having traced the entire&#xD;
series of pictures, returned to the portrait&#xD;
of the child she had designated as the&#xD;
likeness of John Jacob Van Tuyl.&#xD;
"Would you like to know the fate of&#xD;
the original of this picture, Conradin ?"&#xD;
asked the ~vitch.~&#xD;
'I certainly would. I have often sur-&#xD;
mised his fate, and felt exceedingly aux-&#xD;
ions at times to know also whether he be&#xD;
dead or alive."&#xD;
"tie is living, and stands in your pres-&#xD;
ence !"&#xD;
"Uncle !"&#xD;
"Nephew!".&#xD;
Were the simultaneous exclamations&#xD;
that broke from their lips, ~nd the relatives&#xD;
were locked in each other's warm arms.&#xD;
It was a magnetic and warmly sympa-&#xD;
thetic embrace-a spontaneous recogni-&#xD;
tion of consanguineous blood rushing up&#xD;
to commingle in the one grand original&#xD;
stream of sympathy and identity.&#xD;
The person heretofore known as Captain&#xD;
Van Vetchen, was the first to speak.&#xD;
"I believe you were right in your sup-&#xD;
position, after all, Conradiu You sus-&#xD;
pected that I might be your long missing&#xD;
uncle John Jacob, and now the course of&#xD;
aflirirs appears to favor the ~&#xD;
"Oh, you are my uncle-must be my&#xD;
uncle I (10 not want the pleasant illus-&#xD;
ion, if it really be such, dispelled."&#xD;
"But we will first hear all the facts our&#xD;
friend the sorceress may have to reveal,"&#xD;
said the Captain to the lawyer, "so that&#xD;
there may be no room for doubtjn the&#xD;
matter."&#xD;
"'Tis well."&#xD;
The witch produced a painting of a&#xD;
child, which she hung up against the wall&#xD;
alongside of the one which represented&#xD;
the missing John Jacob Van Toyl. It&#xD;
&#xD;
*&#xD;
&#xD;

l0~.                     MINNY LA&#xD;
was the painting which the elder skipper&#xD;
Van Vetchen had caused to be taken of&#xD;
the child found on board his ship. The&#xD;
portraits left no doubt they were likenesses&#xD;
of one and the same person.&#xD;
"I am satisfied! The captain here is&#xD;
my uncle! Enough! What need of&#xD;
further proof, now 2"&#xD;
"You should know the w hole, Conra-&#xD;
din."&#xD;
"XVeII, proceed i."&#xD;
The witch then produced the identical&#xD;
clothing which the boy wore at the time&#xD;
he come under the notice of the old Skip-&#xD;
per, together with several scraps of paper,&#xD;
one of which was an advertisement in an&#xD;
old newspaper, descriptivee of the child's&#xD;
costume and the marks on his body.&#xD;
* "All ri,~ht, to the very letter, as far as&#xD;
I perceive," said Conradin. "The mole&#xD;
mark on your lefi shoulder: and the loss&#xD;
of the pair of small 1oe~ on your right&#xD;
foot, by a wolf trap, you can show them,&#xD;
as a matter of course, Captain ?'&#xD;
He turned back his shirt collar and re-&#xD;
vealed the mole.&#xD;
"Exact to the description here," cried&#xD;
Conradin.&#xD;
As he spoke the Captain revealed his I&#xD;
mutilated foot, and showed the absence of&#xD;
the members alluded to.&#xD;
"Good God I Were there ever proof of&#xD;

"I will! I Ia! In the fullest cordial-&#xD;

The .uncle and nephe~v now ratified&#xD;
their relationship with a cordial and affec-&#xD;

"Now, gentlemen, if you are willing, I&#xD;

She spoke a syllable in some unknown&#xD;
tongue to her spectators, when a panel in&#xD;
the wall fell to the floor, and a lady of&#xD;
remarkable beauty, though of lily pale-&#xD;
ness of face, quickly entered the room.&#xD;
She rushed to the embrace of the gentle-&#xD;
men, saluted them warmly and affection-&#xD;
ately in turn, before they had time to&#xD;
perceive the manner of the witch's hocus&#xD;
pocus operations.&#xD;
"I am really glad to greet you both&#xD;
my dear brother and most beloved neph-&#xD;
ew! The Red Sorceress of Weehaw-&#xD;

She held in hei- hand the wig of long&#xD;
gray hairs, and the scarlet gown she had&#xD;
worn to make her disguise more c mplete,&#xD;
and to inspire awe and faith in her revela-&#xD;
tions, while pursuing the profession of the&#xD;
Sorceress and Fortune Teller. Yes! It&#xD;
was Mary Van Toy I, still retaining much&#xD;
of her original beauty and grace of phys-&#xD;
ical being.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
UNRAVELLING OF THE TANGLED SKEIN OF&#xD;
FATE.&#xD;
The limits of this volume will not allow&#xD;
us to enter into anything like a minute&#xD;
detail, even of the principal incident in&#xD;
the history and lives of the respective par-&#xD;
ties mentioned in this truthful narrative.&#xD;
I'hese very names compose, in sooth, but&#xD;
a very few of the persons associated with&#xD;
'he league of outlaws or who became in-&#xD;
volved indirectly in their villainies. We&#xD;
but present the hinges upon which t~ie&#xD;
whole machinery of diablerie and crime&#xD;
were hung, and leave to the geod sense of&#xD;
the reader to fill up any hiatus or seem-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
log discrepancy as he may best be able.&#xD;
We trust, however, we shall be found suf-&#xD;
ficiently explicit in our general outline of&#xD;
narrative) and be able so to connect the&#xD;
somewhat disjointed plot to render the&#xD;
whole work sufficiently complete and in-&#xD;
telligible.&#xD;
The reader w ho may have traced these&#xD;
pages thus far will have little difficulty in&#xD;
recognizing that the veiled lady who gave&#xD;
birth to the strangely marked child, the&#xD;
beautiful sailor bo~ who ivent to Java on&#xD;
board of Captain Van Vechten's ship, and&#xD;
the Red Sorceress of Weehawken were one&#xD;
and the same pez bun-Mary Rivington,&#xD;
wife of Sydtnharn Van Tayl, and mother&#xD;
of IVlinny Lawson, the lawful child of Sy.&#xD;
denham.&#xD;
The conjecture of Armand that the babe&#xD;
with the "serpent at the heart" was Ar.&#xD;
lington's, by one of his mistresses, was n9t&#xD;
the fact; although more sagack us intel-&#xD;
loots tba~ this servant's mis-'ht have been&#xD;
as readily deceived.&#xD;
Toe Van Tuyl or Arlington villa, as it&#xD;
was often indiscriminately called, arose,&#xD;
from its being occupied by both Syden-&#xD;
ham Van Tnyl and Arlington, in success-&#xD;
ion, as a summer residence. It was, how-&#xD;
ever, originally buil by the elder Van&#xD;
Tuyl, and by him entailed to his posteri-&#xD;
ty, and not convert tble to oth r owners,&#xD;
although it was subject to lease, and the&#xD;
rents appropriated to the Van Tayl family.&#xD;
On the marriage of Sydenham Van&#xD;
TuyI.to Mary Rivicgton, he induced her&#xD;
father to accept of this villa as his home&#xD;
for life, which he was too glad at the time,&#xD;
straightened as he was in his circumstan-&#xD;
ces, to accept.&#xD;
It was to this villa that Mary retired, to&#xD;
the bosom of her parents, after having be-&#xD;
come literally the outcast of her husband's&#xD;
family, on the death of Ida Wilton and&#xD;
&#xD;
THE OUTLAWS' LEAGUE.               103&#xD;
&#xD;
Sydenham's inexplicable disappearance,&#xD;
to give birth to her first born child,&#xD;
the babe with the "serpent at the hearL'~&#xD;
It so happened that on the very day of the&#xD;
night the child was born, Arliqgton had&#xD;
visited the villa, and being informed of&#xD;
the critical health of Mary, by her father,&#xD;
he volunteered to send her aid, which was&#xD;
accomplished by dispatching the Midwife&#xD;
O'Hara in company with Armand and&#xD;
Wilkins, in old Switzer'a boat to this Is-&#xD;
land, as heretofore sufficiently detailed.&#xD;
Nor is it particularly strange that old&#xD;
Mr. Rivington should desire the de~truo-&#xD;
tiun of thu unfortunate child, Or that Mary&#xD;
herself was seemingly indifferent to its&#xD;
fate. She was viewed in the eyes of the&#xD;
world, in the light of a harlot and adul-&#xD;
tress, though entirely guiltless of the&#xD;
slightest infidelity to her liege lord.-&#xD;
Conceiving accordingly that he had been&#xD;
the main instrument in heaping infamy&#xD;
and '-ceo or her inorm~t head, whatever&#xD;
th~ love arid rcsp ~4re might h~ave en-&#xD;
-tertained for her husband, o ~-a~ changed&#xD;
to a sentiment of bitterness and rev~engc~.&#xD;
Similar feelings agitated her father's bo-&#xD;
som, because of the supposed wrongs he&#xD;
himselfjiad received in the contempt and&#xD;
outrage put upon the dearest and sweet-&#xD;
est child of his tamily-.his ever favorite&#xD;
and beloved Mary. Add to this, Arling-&#xD;
ton, who had become .one of the adrninis-&#xD;
trators of the Van Tuyl estate, had called&#xD;
the very day above mentioned, to give Mr.&#xD;
Rivington notice to vacate the villa with&#xD;
all possible dispatch, or to ensure the&#xD;
prompt pa~'ment of the subsequent rent-&#xD;
aJs.&#xD;
After Mary's child was born her father&#xD;
retained to the State of New Jersey whith-&#xD;
er Mary accompanied him and remained&#xD;
until she had fully recovered her health.&#xD;
She then put into execution some plans&#xD;

104              MINNY LAWSON, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
long resolved upon, as among the surest&#xD;
and readiest way of meeting her husband,&#xD;
and seeking that sati~factIon or revenge of&#xD;
him, which she felt an innocent, but&#xD;
outraged and scandalized wife had a right&#xD;
to demand from a husband who had&#xD;
thrust her from his bosom without a sufil-&#xD;
ci~nt cause.&#xD;
We see her accordingly disguising her-&#xD;
asif ih sailor-boy habiliaments and making&#xD;
her way across the trackless ocean to&#xD;
Yava, where she fondly anticipated to in-&#xD;
tercept her truant husband, or else from&#xD;
some of his numerous commercial scores~&#xD;
pondents in the island, to learn where he&#xD;
would be likely to be found, if living on&#xD;
the face of the earth. In this, however,&#xD;
she was unsuccessful. When she arrived&#xD;
out ,they-had not even heard of the strange&#xD;
things that had transpired in New York&#xD;
connectedd with t~ie Van Thy) family.&#xD;
'~Fhe ~oung Laptain V~n Veo~n, (wL~&#xD;
ln-oved to ~ehe~ kuC~er-iu-la w, 3ohn ~a-&#xD;
cob i an~v~i, the missing lad,) having&#xD;
4iscovered her sex, did all in his power to&#xD;
render her stay in Java as pleasant as&#xD;
possible-furnishing her with money, and&#xD;
securing her a home in an agreeable Dutch&#xD;
family until she should feel disposed to&#xD;
return to her own native land again.&#xD;
The generous-hearted skipper being&#xD;
compelled to continue his voyages left her&#xD;
behind, when she introduced herself&#xD;
amoog the native Japanese and soon be-&#xD;
came familiar with their strana6 eusto~ns&#xD;
and rites, and among many other things,&#xD;
acquired their arts of sorcery and fortune&#xD;
telling, together with the nature of certain&#xD;
roots and flowers, which had the virtue of&#xD;
restoring faded female beauty, or of im-&#xD;
partiag to the most youthful virgin, the&#xD;
appearance of wrinkled and decrepit old&#xD;
age.&#xD;
She readily conceived the idea of set-&#xD;
&#xD;
ting up for a Fortune Teller in her native&#xD;
land, and by means of her occult and ma-&#xD;
gic sciences seek to fathom the mysteries&#xD;
which had hung over the destinies of the&#xD;
Van TuyI family She fancied by pursu-&#xD;
ing such profession in New York, she&#xD;
would be able to learn much of the hidden&#xD;
secrets (,f the city, and perhaps be ena-&#xD;
bled in time to unravel the thread of fate~&#xD;
In this she was nearly altogether right.&#xD;
Her visi~or~ were of all ranks and condi-&#xD;
tions of life, from whom, by her peculiar&#xD;
tact and adroitness of manner, she was&#xD;
able to glean a world of information in re-&#xD;
gard to the closest secrets of every family&#xD;
in the community. She became cogni-&#xD;
zant of the league of outlaws, and ascer-&#xD;
tained the leading parties concerned in&#xD;
nearly every case at outlawry and crime.&#xD;
She knew both the public and private&#xD;
char ietcrs of Arlington, Ilurrell, and an-&#xD;
nnd fira2lj laid her ~&amp;amp;&#xD;
with a certainty of eot~ngling ti~&amp;amp;~ l~&#xD;
in the meshes of the law. The time wan&#xD;
already at hand.&#xD;
It should be here stated, that the Red&#xD;
Witch of Weehawken, gaye but a limited&#xD;
portion of her time to the pursuit of for-&#xD;
tune telling. Her hours and days for such&#xD;
purposes, were stated and regular, and&#xD;
never violated on any pretext whatever.&#xD;
Meanwhile, she assumed all manner of&#xD;
disguises, and commingled in all kinds of&#xD;
open and mixed society. Her actual home&#xD;
was Arljngton~s villar as it was now gen-~&#xD;
erally called, wl'ich she continued to en-&#xD;
ter and leave without ever having been&#xD;
observed. Here she resided with her aged&#xD;
father, having sought him out and brought&#xD;
him from the country again to this i~bode,&#xD;
on her return from 3ava, now the last&#xD;
of her race besides herself. The por-&#xD;
tion of the villa which they occupied and&#xD;
remained free from any intrusion, was a&#xD;

THE OUTLAWS) LEAGUE.                           105&#xD;
wing of the building tWit had fallen into under which a child hid been born in that&#xD;
&#xD;
entire disuse by o'her people, because of&#xD;
a superstition that obtained that- it was&#xD;
tenanted by ghostly inhabitants of another&#xD;
world. This ilea, however, but the more&#xD;
readily served to render the part of the&#xD;
habitation chosen by Mary and her father&#xD;
the more secure from intrusion and mo-&#xD;
lestation.&#xD;
Here the witch was in the habit of en-&#xD;
tertaining the ~allant Captain Van Vech-&#xD;
ten in the presence of her father, on all&#xD;
his return voyages from tho East, a friend-&#xD;
ship having sprung up between them of a&#xD;
very disinterested and cordial character,&#xD;
long before either Mary or the captain&#xD;
knew of their actual relations~jp to each&#xD;
other, as brother and sister-i -law.&#xD;
The listener who had overhear Armand&#xD;
relate his wild and terrible stories to Mar-&#xD;
gery, was Mary herself, while the gentle-&#xD;
man who had personated the ghost of Sy-&#xD;
denham Van Toy), was his brother, John&#xD;
Jacob, the ci-devant sailor, Captain Van&#xD;
Vechten.&#xD;
Mary, or the Witch, as the reader&#xD;
pleases, from the first had seen all the&#xD;
movements of Arlington's servants, since&#xD;
the evening that Minny was brought to&#xD;
the villa by them, until their own sudden&#xD;
retreat therefrom, on the m3 serious dis-&#xD;
appearance of the outraged girl from&#xD;
the sumptuous couch on which she had&#xD;
been placed in a helpless condition and&#xD;
left in the oval room of the habitation-&#xD;
This room communicated by a secret&#xD;
panel with the haunted part. fly this&#xD;
nwans or channel, the aged witch pene-&#xD;
trated and discovered the condition of&#xD;
Minny, and applied restorative, unknown&#xD;
by Margery and Armand, which had the&#xD;
effect of rapidly restoring her health. -&#xD;
On the very night she had overheard Ar-&#xD;
mand speak ef the peculiar circumstances&#xD;
&#xD;
very room wh 're Minney had replied,&#xD;
she instantly realized that 1'dinney was&#xD;
her own daughter5 restored to her arms&#xD;
again in the identical place from whence&#xD;
she had been torn fom her bos'n~ nearly&#xD;
firtec'n years. hefre. She accordingly&#xD;
quickly bore her to her own apartments,&#xD;
to the presence of her aged sire and the&#xD;
girl's uncle John Jacob, as we must hence-&#xD;
forth call him, instead of the skipper Van&#xD;
Vechten -&#xD;
It was a strange and providence guided&#xD;
meeting-a discovery of disjointed re-&#xD;
lationship, and consanguineous blood, in&#xD;
a thrilling and heart-gushing attraction&#xD;
and sympathetic affection.&#xD;
CI1APTEII~ XXIV.&#xD;
TIlE DENOUEMENT-AND ALL WENT&#xD;
IIIERRYAS A MARRIAGE BELL.&#xD;
AFTER some hours further consultation,&#xD;
the party of the villa, consisting of quite a&#xD;
family group, including the patriarch Riv-&#xD;
ington, M~ry Van Toyl, her child Minny&#xD;
Lawson, and John Jacob Van Tayl and&#xD;
Conradin Van Tuyl, partook of some re-&#xD;
past, and returned to the city to take the&#xD;
necessary legal steps for the arrest ot the&#xD;
principal conspirators and outlaws. Con-&#xD;
radin had recently taken a gay young&#xD;
wife, and opened a sumptuous establish-&#xD;
ment in the heart of the fashions of the&#xD;
city. In this home the whole of his new-&#xD;
ly found relatives and friends were in-&#xD;
stalled for the time-being, until abodes&#xD;
more suitable to their respective wishes&#xD;
and inclinations could be chosen.&#xD;
The uncle and nephew at once entered&#xD;
upon investigations of th~e strange stories&#xD;
of crime and outlawry, and with the aid&#xD;
of ~r well-known thief-taker, Mr. Jacob&#xD;
Hays, soon got on the . track of the out-&#xD;

106               MINNY LAWSON, Oft&#xD;
&#xD;
laws and conspirators against the lives&#xD;
and properties of the citizens. Armand&#xD;
and Margery were fl~st, arrested, and se-&#xD;
parated in distinct prison-cells; and, thro'&#xD;
their fear of punishment and desire to&#xD;
turn states' evidence, the entire ramifica-&#xD;
tions of the outlaws' league were develo-&#xD;
ped to the proper authorities. Arrests,&#xD;
accordingly, continued to be made of nu-&#xD;
nierous others, Including Burton and hi~&#xD;
wife, but as it was deemed unwise to se-&#xD;
cure the smaller rogues in the meshes of&#xD;
the law, and give the larger ones rcom to&#xD;
escape, in consequence of the rumors that&#xD;
prevaiI~d of' numerous arrests having been&#xD;
made by the police, Armand and Mar-&#xD;
ger~, Burtcn and his wIfe, were allowed&#xD;
again to mingle with their confederates&#xD;
as sort of decoy-ducks, to ensure the&#xD;
capture of the entire gang. Ufhese parties&#xD;
were placed under the watchful surved-&#xD;
ance of a secret police, so that it would have&#xD;
been impossible for any of them to have&#xD;
made their escape, however aided or back-&#xD;
ed by their colleagues lif crime, ifin-&#xD;
deed, they meditate~l ~uch purpose, which&#xD;
was fai from being the case; each and&#xD;
all of them alleging their desire to give&#xD;
over a life of outlawry and crime, could&#xD;
they be certain of obtaining immunities for&#xD;
their past offences.&#xD;
At length the revenue cutter returned&#xD;
to port, after the chase of the "long, low&#xD;
black," piratical or smuggling schooner,&#xD;
without being able to overhaul or capture&#xD;
the suspicious craft. The black schooner&#xD;
proved not only a superior sailor in the&#xD;
chase we have heretofore spoken of, but&#xD;
night came and left the Cutter on a sand-&#xD;
beach, while almost at the same moment,&#xD;
a vessel supposed to be the black schooner&#xD;
was observed to ~e on fire a long distance&#xD;
ahead, over the Cutter's bows.&#xD;
The city was bustling with naval offi-&#xD;
&#xD;
cers and anxious merc~?~ts, standing at&#xD;
every corner, and speaking '~f the strange&#xD;
craft and the chase by the Catter. Si-&#xD;
multaneously with these gatiierin~s, there&#xD;
were noticed also a large number of' atran-&#xD;
ge'rs in the city, principally seafaring men,&#xD;
mixed up with a superior class as regard-&#xD;
ed their costume an(l gentlemanly address.&#xD;
The authorities SOOfl learned, through&#xD;
Armand and other spies, that a good por-&#xD;
tion of these strangers were recently&#xD;
among the oflicersand cre~y of the suspi-&#xD;
cious schooner, wliich had so saucily sailed&#xD;
in ancf out of the harbor, and over the wa-&#xD;
ters of the adining bay and ocean.&#xD;
They also ascertained that the outlaws&#xD;
were about to hold some grand orgies ip&#xD;
commemoration of their exloits and sq~.-&#xD;
cesses, and with a view to a generaJ-'~dfs~&#xD;
tribution of their ill-gotten treasures&#xD;
wealth among the faithful of the league.&#xD;
The rendezvous was designated, an~ ~1ii-&#xD;
ther the outlaws repaired on the ~veq1ng&#xD;
indicated-the details of which gathe ~irig&#xD;
will be found narrated in the opening&#xD;
chapter of this romance.&#xD;
The members of the league continued&#xD;
to arrive at the old Van Tuyl mansion till&#xD;
past midnight, when their rites began, and&#xD;
the sound of' music, and revelry, and or~&#xD;
gies were heard within.&#xD;
~ The concourse was vettr large; but it&#xD;
should be stated Zhat full one half of them&#xD;
were policemen in disguise, who had ob-&#xD;
tained the passports of entrance from&#xD;
Armand and Burton, making their appear~&#xD;
ance one by one, in the same manner&#xD;
with the outlaws, in promisqt~ous route&#xD;
and revelry, by means of subterranean pas-&#xD;
sages leading from Burton's "Jolly Boat-&#xD;
~~fl'~ Tavern-the old well where the&#xD;
body of kIn Wilton had been found, and&#xD;
by the water sewers of the house to the&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
It was a strange and startling congre-&#xD;
gation of villains and their ~nenies-the&#xD;
police! They now danced and gamed,&#xD;
and indulged it~ every sens~tal and infer-&#xD;
nal revelry, without being aware of the&#xD;
vo canoes of danger upon which they&#xD;
sported.&#xD;
The orgies had been kept up some time,&#xD;
when the quarrel en~aued between the&#xD;
group of gamblers, Duhois, Trevalyan&#xD;
and the young Fizz Clarence, which re-&#xD;
sulted in the death of Di~bois, and the&#xD;
serious injury of Fitz Cl ~rEnce. This&#xD;
person, as before stated, pn~ved to be a-&#xD;
woman. S:ie was the mistress of the Neth-&#xD;
erland Prince, up~n wlon~ had been lav-&#xD;
ished immense regal treasUres. It will be&#xD;
remembered that the woman first quar-&#xD;
relled with the Prince, then became the&#xD;
mistress of St. Pierre de Reney, the arti-&#xD;
ficer in silver and gold, a~id subsequently&#xD;
the paramour of Arlington, by whom she&#xD;
had been brought to the United States to&#xD;
meet her (leath (as alleged) by poison at&#xD;
his binds. This at least he attempted to&#xD;
accomplish, but Heaven overruled his&#xD;
wickedness at the time, to prove the re-&#xD;
morseless poisoner's death by her hand&#xD;
in the sequel.. She it w~s who occupkd&#xD;
the haunted portion of Arlington's villa&#xD;
for many years after her alleged&#xD;
death, when, through the instrumen-&#xD;
tality of Armnand, she managed to re-&#xD;
turn to Europe. Here she sought out. the&#xD;
profligate Prince and informed him in&#xD;
whose pos~ses&amp;amp;on a large amount of the&#xD;
jewels of the House of Brunswick was&#xD;
retained. This Prince shortly after, on&#xD;
coming to the throne, dispatched a trusty&#xD;
agent to New York with his former mis-&#xD;
tress with a view to the recovery of such&#xD;
important treasures. That agent was&#xD;
Trevatyan. The old gambler Dubois&#xD;
was the assumed, or rather the original&#xD;
&#xD;
107&#xD;
&#xD;
name of Arlington, one of the most ac-&#xD;
complished villains that ever lived upon&#xD;
the face of the earth. He barely escaped&#xD;
the penalty due to his many horrid crimes&#xD;
at the hand of Justice to nie by the&#xD;
hands of a cast-off, and, as he had fondly&#xD;
supposed, murdered woman!&#xD;
A terrible scene of disorder arose on&#xD;
the result of the gambler's quarrel, but&#xD;
the unknown and prompt appearance of&#xD;
the constabulatory force quickly queUed&#xD;
the outbreak, while they took captive a&#xD;
large number of the outlaws, who were&#xD;
safely lo~g~' prison for trial. A few&#xD;
persons escaped, b~ut it was believed the&#xD;
principal c&amp;amp;spirators were entrapped.&#xD;
The courts happened to be in session at the&#xD;
time, and the outlaws were summarily&#xD;
disposed of and dispatched to the State's&#xD;
prison for terms of years proportioned to&#xD;
their supposedd offences. Much jewelry,&#xD;
plate, and other property were recovered&#xD;
and restored to the rightful owners, inclu-&#xD;
ding the crown jewels of the House of&#xD;
Brut swick, which were pointed out totlie&#xD;
Police by Armand, buried in the sands of.~&#xD;
the beach of Fire island.&#xD;
The public mind' had become tuflamed&#xD;
to the last degree in view of all those ter-&#xD;
rible)revelations. it would scarcely allow&#xD;
the rites of a decent burial to the remains&#xD;
of Both Arlington and Burrell. Arling-&#xD;
ton, or Dubois, was regarded as a monster&#xD;
of such infamous die, that his dead body&#xD;
would have beeh torn in pieces and given&#xD;
to the dogs by the excited popuJace, had&#xD;
not a strong military guard been placed&#xD;
over in, until there was an opportunity to&#xD;
convey it away and bury it in secret. So&#xD;
with Burrell's.-although the indignation&#xD;
was less intense-there was hut one sen-&#xD;
timent that his course of libertinism mer-&#xD;
ited the awful nature of his death.&#xD;

were taken up from the earth of Arling-&#xD;
ton's cellar, where tbey had been deposi-&#xD;
ted by Armoand and Wilkin's, after his&#xD;
murder, and buried with unusual demon-&#xD;
strations of pomp and respect. Even the&#xD;
*     corpse of Black Raif was carried to the&#xD;
grave by a concourse of white citizens,&#xD;
larger, perhaps, than ever before or since&#xD;
attended the obsequies of a colored indi-&#xD;
vidual. A rmand and Wilkins were both&#xD;
tried as the murderers and alders in the&#xD;
tragedy by which S~denham Van Tayl&#xD;
and Ida Wilton came t their death-&#xD;
found guilty of murder in the first degree,&#xD;
and hung together, on one of the small&#xD;
lalaruds in the harbor of New York.&#xD;
But what of George Lawson? Ho was&#xD;
also tried and convicted of the murder of&#xD;
~oIon~l flurrell, and sentenced to be hung!&#xD;
Through the influence, however, of Mary,&#xD;
Oonradin, and John Jacob Van Tuyl, and&#xD;
other friends, strongly mitigating circum-&#xD;
stances were offered in behalf of the&#xD;
youth, which resulted in a full and uncon-&#xD;
ditional pardon being granted to him by&#xD;
the executive clemency.&#xD;
Minny, and her still called Brother&#xD;
Georgewere again restored to each other's&#xD;
arms, soon after to change such affinities&#xD;
for the more sacred one of husband and&#xD;
wife, when her mother, his dear old father&#xD;
the gardener Lawson, and the kind-heart-&#xD;
ed and veteran boatman Switzer, came to&#xD;
reside beneath his roof, in a mansion&#xD;
worthy of a connection with the influen-&#xD;
tial and still wealthy family of Van Tayl.&#xD;
The wedding of George and Minny was&#xD;
celebrated with a grand ball and private&#xD;
masquerade, in a new and elegant mansion&#xD;
.presented t&amp;amp;his young and lovely niece&#xD;
by Joha Jacob Van Tuyl; and the very&#xD;
ring and purse that had been left at her&#xD;
reputed father's cottage in her infant hours&#xD;
were also restored to the blushing bride,&#xD;
&#xD;
as the first gift of her grandfather, and of&#xD;
her mother to her, and now found carefully&#xD;

It was while the masquerade ball was&#xD;

struck upon the ears of Mary Van Tuyl,&#xD;
while she rejoiced and wept now in the&#xD;
happiness in store for her daughter Minny,&#xD;
and her manly son-in-law George Lawson.&#xD;
It was music such as she had heard but&#xD;
once in her life before, and from only one&#xD;
pair of lips. She listened again. The&#xD;
music continued. She quickly bent her&#xD;
steps to the direction of the conservatory&#xD;
whence it had appeared to proceed. She&#xD;
caught a glimpse of the lute player. She&#xD;
could not be mistaken in his splendid form&#xD;
and noble features. It was the gallant&#xD;
Edmos~dson-her first betrothed! They&#xD;
were clasped in each other's arms, and&#xD;
all the wells of their original natures&#xD;
overflowed to the refreshment of their&#xD;
breasts after so many hug years absences&#xD;
and amid such strange vicissitudes and&#xD;
chances of every day life. A few words&#xD;
sufficed to render the mutual explanations&#xD;
satisfactory between them. Edmondson&#xD;
informed her that himself and Thornton&#xD;
were twin brothers, which would account&#xD;

OR~&#xD;
THE CONSPJRATOIVS VICTIM.&#xD;
BY NED BUNTLINE.&#xD;
Tuis novel is one of those rare conceptions which every now and then make&#xD;
their appearance to amaze and convulse the world. It abounds in all those stir-&#xD;
ring .incidents, and bold vigorous passages, which have so long been the distinguish-&#xD;
ing features of Mr. Judson's writings. Although not written in the shape, it re-&#xD;
quires but a glance at its pages to satisfy any intelligent mind that it is nothing&#xD;
more nor less than an Autobiography of its mlustrious author, and a record of one&#xD;
of the most remarkable conspiracies for the overthrow and destruction of its hero,&#xD;
that ever disgraced a people. It is a revelation of the wrongs and sufferings which&#xD;
every pure-hearted patriot and reformer must expect to encounter in his efforts to&#xD;
ameliorate the condition of the struggling masses, and lead them on to a nobler&#xD;
destiny than that in which he finds them. And, taking a single leaf from his own&#xD;
extraordinarily adventurous history, Mr. Judson presents in TH E CONVICT a&#xD;
picture, bold in its outlines, and graphically stirring in its narrative and details of&#xD;
persecution and suffering, which stands without a rival even in this age of mas-&#xD;
terly painting, either with the pencil or the pen. Every one is familiar with the&#xD;
fact of Mr. Judson's sentence to, and incarceration at, the Penitentiary ; but few,&#xD;
even of his most intimate friends, are aware how he came to be transformed, from&#xD;
the character of a free citizen to that of a sentenced felon-A CH AINED CONVICT.-&#xD;
The details of that conspiray, die character of the network by which he was grad-&#xD;
ually drawn in and ensnared, the treachery with which he was on all sides beset-&#xD;
extending even to the trustiest of his friends, as well as to the very partner of his&#xD;
heart-and the infamous characters in the black drama of which he was at once&#xD;
the hero and the victim-must, to be learned, be sought alone in the thrilling&#xD;
pages cf this&#xD;

THE RIVAL SUITORS.&#xD;

BEfUTffiJLL~ HLU~TaA~ -PRi~ ~&#xD;
~j~llIS capital Book is of the "Charles 0 Malley" school--full of dashing&#xD;
adventures, love intrigues, brilliant sketches of battle scenes, in which - the&#xD;
iAspiring headlong charge and terrible defeat are detailed with 'all the force of&#xD;
truth. The BivouAc belongs, as we have said, to a popular class of books, and&#xD;
we think it decidedly the very best of its class. We have not the space, though&#xD;
we have a strong inclination, to giv~ our readers a taste of its quality-to re-&#xD;
Print at length the matchless scene of the lover's meeting the fortune-teller in the&#xD;
gloom of the forest; the appalling interviOw and the grave-stories in the church-&#xD;
yard at midnight; the droll dialogues of the regimental mess-table; the eloquent&#xD;
description of ~the encampment of the rival armies; the fearful carnage of the&#xD;
battle-field; the pi'odigies of vaLor peribrined during the mountain combat; the&#xD;
richly-humorous "confessions of a gentleman who would have married if he&#xD;
e~nld ;?' and a dozen other delineations marked in every page by some bold trait&#xD;
of wit oi' genius. The war-lik~ descriptions will vie with the most animated&#xD;
scenes in Allison or Napier; and the humorous portions of the book have np&#xD;
peers but in the pages of Lever or Lover.-.Afornirs.q Star.&#xD;
Tha BIvouAc, on P.IvAL SUITORS, by Col. W. H. Maxwell, is on~ of thos&amp;amp;&#xD;
,popular rpmanc~s which are eagerly devoured by readers of fiction, and, in this&#xD;
instance; without the deleterious influence which is too frequently attributed to&#xD;
much of the literature of the d:~y~ ,The"' Bivouac" is a spirited, well-conceived.&#xD;
and.thrilhing picture in the 0'MalLcy style. The menioir of a ruined beauty,&#xD;
which occurs iii the course of the story, is a touching exhibition of the extreme&#xD;
anguish which flattery and falsehood may inflict. Garrett &amp;amp; Co~, New York,&#xD;
have issued it in fair type ar~d with illustrations.-Saturday courier.&#xD;

'HOW TO WIN A WIFE.&#xD;
BY THE AUTHOR OF&#xD;
"MINNIE GREY, OR WHO IS THE HEIR," "AMY LAW-&#xD;
RENCE," "STANFIELD HALL," ETC.&#xD;
BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATED. PRICE 50 CENT.'&#xD;
TaosE who have read "Stanfield Hall," or " Minnie Grey,"-and who&#xD;
has not ?.-will require only a mere announcement of the above work, to in-&#xD;
duce them to obtaiit and give it an immediate perusal. Its author is oe of'&#xD;
the very few in the world of literature, who wins upbR acquaintance. If it&#xD;
were said that he Writes but little, we would rejoin that he writes that little&#xD;
well. His3 pages glow with the very spirit of romance. His pen moves like&#xD;
the wand of an enchanter. It dissects human passion as keenly as the scalpel&#xD;
of the surgeon. The author's power over his readers is not greater than his&#xD;
command of his dramatis person. His lawyers arc lawyers, his Jews arec&#xD;
Jews indeed,'and not merely lugged in to fill up achapter and lengthen out&#xD;
a book. Individuality stamps all the creations of our author with an ace~u-&#xD;
racy wjiich makes them like real live personages, and gives to the whole work&#xD;
an interest rarely found in modern romance. We predict for "Gus Howard"&#xD;
an enduring popularity and a world wide perusal.-London Atlienxvum.&#xD;
