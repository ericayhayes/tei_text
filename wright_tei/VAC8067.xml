THE TIDE AT ITS FLOOD.&#xD;
"There will no man do for your sake, I think,&#xD;

I had wrung my life dry for your lips to drink,&#xD;
Broken It up for your daily bread."&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
"'HE COMET NOT,' 5HH SAID."&#xD;
TEN o'clock on a glorious May day, with the&#xD;
freshly-risen sea-breeze sweeping over the&#xD;
sparkling waters of Charleston harbor; the&#xD;
bright sun gilding all things with a flood of&#xD;
golden glory; the white shipping dazzling the&#xD;
eyes like snow; the wooded shores clothed&#xD;
in a royal garment of soft purple mist; the&#xD;
stately city throne like a queen between her&#xD;
"swiftly-flowing" rivers, while the surf of the&#xD;
great Atlantic beats like i~$usic at her feet; a&#xD;
fragrance of roses per~ding the air, and an&#xD;
abounding sense of glol~y,,~uld vitality in the&#xD;
buoyant atmospher~at~re has opened all&#xD;
her choicest stores on this marvellously lovely&#xD;
day, this 15th of May, 185-; there is not a&#xD;
tint known to art which she is not wearing,&#xD;
and many-'~~how many !-for which art has&#xD;
neither name nor power to reproduce. Out&#xD;
on the sea there is an opalescent glory, chang.&#xD;
ing and shifting with every gleam of light that&#xD;
catches the foam-crested waves as they rise&#xD;
and chase each other like merry children in&#xD;
the sunshine! The land seems panting under&#xD;
its wealth of loveliness, of fragrance, and of&#xD;
bloom! I~verywhere Is spread earth's match-&#xD;
less livery of green and gold; every breath of&#xD;
air is flower-scented; every sound-..-even the&#xD;
&#xD;
city's distant hum of pleasure az~d trs~fflc-.--is&#xD;
subordinate to the divine anthem which the&#xD;
myriad voices of Nature are chanting-the&#xD;
sweet Invitation which they give to the chil-&#xD;
dren of mend "Come!" say the waves in&#xD;
their soft tones of ceaseless, rhythmic musIc.&#xD;
"Come ~" echo the happy songs.of birds, the&#xD;
merry chirp of the great, invisible lnsect.world.&#xD;
"Come!" whisper the breezes softer than those&#xD;
of Araby the Blest. "Come!" murmurthe trees,&#xD;
gently swaying their emerald leaves and fling~&#xD;
lug graceful shadows over the velvet turf-a.&#xD;
"come and be happy!" And how few answer!&#xD;
-~--howfew do not go on~their way, be it tofuner.&#xD;
al or to feast, with blinded eyes and deafened&#xD;
earA! Yet, to those who love her as ~he should&#xD;
be loved, is not Nature God'sambassador upon&#xD;
earth, speaking, in everyquiver of her wondrous&#xD;
light and shade, "glad tidings of great jay?"&#xD;
o rare, sweet ma~gna mater I In all this weary,&#xD;
sin-laden, suffering-steeped world, there is&#xD;
nothing like to thee;'there Is no joy like thy&#xD;
joy, no beauty like thy beauty, no glory like&#xD;
thy glory; thou who art stills fair ~ind yo~m~&#xD;
and fresh as when thy first dew-drops glittered&#xD;
in the sunlight of the creation moi'nlng, and&#xD;
even thy gracious Maker owned that thou ~vert&#xD;
"good!" And who would see this noble mis-&#xD;
tress in her most royal mood, who would wor-&#xD;
ship at her most royal shrine, must seek her&#xD;
where she loves best to dwell-nnder the deep.&#xD;

8                           EBB-TIDE.                                                                  "'JIB COMET NOT,' SHE SAID."                 9&#xD;
&#xD;
blue Southern sky, by the purple Southern wa-&#xD;
ters, far in the gorgeous depths and dim re-&#xD;
ceases of the aromatic southern woods! No.&#xD;
where else does she hold out her arms with&#xD;
such a tender embrace, nowhere else does she&#xD;
woo us with such regal charms, nowhere else&#xD;
does she wear such robes of state as clothe her&#xD;
amid the glory and beauty of these enchanted&#xD;
Scenes.&#xD;
Yet a girl, who stands on the pleasant Bat.&#xD;
tery, leaning. against the railing, and looking&#xD;
with wistful eyes far adown the bright bay to&#xD;
the broad ocean beyond, seems wholly uncon-&#xD;
scious of all the witchery round her. She has&#xD;
tilted her hat forward so as to keep the sun&#xD;
out of her eyes, and there she leans, a mo.&#xD;
tionless, absorbed figure, heeding the curious&#xD;
glances of the few loiterers who come and go,&#xD;
as little as the boundless glory of earth and&#xD;
sea and sky. A vessel is just crossing the imr&#xD;
into the harbor; the day is so wonderfully&#xD;
clear that through&#xD;
"The purple noon's transparent light"&#xD;
It is possible to catch a glimpse of the spars&#xD;
and rigging outlined against the sky-no hor-&#xD;
rible, ugly steamer, belching forth black&#xD;
smoke, but a graceful sailing-vessel, with slen.&#xD;
der masts and snow-white canvas, outspread like&#xD;
an angel's wings. The girl lifts an opera-glass&#xD;
to her eyes, and gazes eagerly-oh, so eagerly I&#xD;
-toward the new-coiner, the stranger, perhaps,&#xD;
the friend it may be. Two or three nurses,&#xD;
accompanied by children, pass, and, stopping,&#xD;
gaze also, open-mouthed, ~t the cloud of can-&#xD;
vas far away. They can find nothing remark-&#xD;
able about it, however; so, after a time, they&#xD;
continue their promenade. Other nurses fol-&#xD;
low, other children scamper past-the Battery&#xD;
is at all hours the paradise of these two class-&#xD;
es of the population; then come two ladies&#xD;
(veiled so as to effectualIy~shut out all possibil-&#xD;
ity of enjoying the day!); then an old gentle-&#xD;
man, walking leisurely with his hands behind&#xD;
hi0 back; then a young gentleman on horse.&#xD;
back, who looks keenly at the graceful, motion.&#xD;
less figure with the opera.glass levelled (appar-&#xD;
ently) at Fort Sumter; then a tall, handsome&#xD;
girl, who, ascending the steps, walks directly&#xD;
up to the figure in question and touches its&#xD;
arm.&#xD;
"Ermine I" she says, sharply. Then-as&#xD;
the opera-glass falls, and the girl turns round&#xD;
-" How can you stand here making a figure&#xD;
of yourself for the amusement of all the pass-&#xD;
&#xD;
ers-by? If I were you, I would have more&#xD;
dignity. Aunt Victorine sent me for you; she&#xD;
said she thought you would be here."&#xD;
"What does she want with me?" asked&#xD;
Ermine, with evident signs of rebellion about&#xD;
the eyes and lips.&#xD;
The other shrugged her shoulders-a gest-&#xD;
ure which betrayed her Gallic nationality at&#xD;
once.&#xD;
"How can I tell? .ilfa tante keeps her own&#xD;
counsel, you may be sure. Perhaps she does&#xD;
not want you to stand here 'like Patience on&#xD;
a monument,' for all Charleston to stare at&#xD;
and talk about. I can't wonder at that, I am&#xD;
sure!"&#xD;
"What do I care for being stared at or&#xD;
talked about?"&#xD;
"Nothing, of course; but Aunt Victorine&#xD;
cares a good deal, you see."&#xD;
"I only came out for a walk" (impatient-&#xD;
ly). "Why cannot mamma let me alone?"&#xD;
"Only for a walk!" repeated the other,&#xD;
mockingly. "And how far have you walked?&#xD;
I wager my pearl necklace (which is the most&#xD;
valuable thing I have in the world) that you&#xD;
have not stirred from the spot since you came&#xD;
here."&#xD;
"Well" (a little defiantly), "what then?"&#xD;
"Oh, nothing then-except that I don't&#xD;
think your exercise will be likely to benefit you&#xD;
much. Raymond said last night you were look-&#xD;
ing quite pale."&#xD;
"Raymond's opinion is not of the least im-&#xD;
portance to me."&#xD;
"Of course not; it is not to be supposed&#xD;
that anybody's opinion weighed with the for-&#xD;
lorn Marianna, when&#xD;
'She said, "I am aweary,&#xD;
He cometh not," she said;&#xD;
She said, "I am aweary,&#xD;
I would that I were dead."'&#xD;
Only you haven't quite reached that point yet&#xD;
-have you, ma belle t"&#xD;
"If you came here to amuse yourself by&#xD;
laughing at me, Madelon, I think you might&#xD;
have stayed at home."&#xD;
"Do you suppose I came of my own accord,&#xD;
dear? I thought I told you Aunt Victorine sent&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"Ask her to send a servant next time,&#xD;
then," said Ermine, coldly-after which she&#xD;
turned seaward again, and lifted her glass to&#xD;
her eyes.&#xD;
A dark-red flush came over the face of the&#xD;
girl called Madden.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I presume she thought she was doing&#xD;
something equivalent to that in sending me,"&#xD;
she said, bitterly. "It is kind of you, Ermine,&#xD;
to remind me of my position."&#xD;
"I did not intend to remind you of what&#xD;
you call your position, Madelon," said Ermine,&#xD;
lowering the glass again with a si'gh.-Ah!&#xD;
there was no familiar outline about those spars&#xD;
and sails; it was a stranger and no friends&#xD;
after all.---" You are so susceptible "(she gave&#xD;
the word a French meaning and, a French&#xD;
accent), "that you always think one intends&#xD;
what has never entered one's head. What is&#xD;
your position, after allJ I'm Mr. Erie's step-&#xD;
daughter; you' are his wife's niece: neither of&#xD;
us has any claim on him apart from mam-&#xD;
ma."&#xD;
"Is that all the difference between us?"&#xD;
asked Madelon, sarcastically. "Thank you,&#xD;
Ermine, for failing to remind me that you are&#xD;
an heiress, and I am a dependent."&#xD;
"But, Madelon-"&#xD;
"Only it would have been best to acknowl-&#xD;
edge the fact at once. Of course, it is absurd&#xD;
to suppose thatit could have been out of your&#xD;
mind."&#xD;
"It has never been very much in my&#xD;
mind," said Ermine, a little wearily,&#xD;
The other shrugged her shoulders again-&#xD;
this time with a skeptical smile out of unison&#xD;
with so young a face-then she, too, looked&#xD;
out overdhe bright bay, and nothing more was&#xD;
said for several minutes.&#xD;
They were first cousins, and considered&#xD;
very much alike, these two girls, yet the re-&#xD;
semblance was more in general appearance&#xD;
than in detail. Both were tall, both slender,&#xD;
both had the graceful bearing, the waxen com-&#xD;
plexion, and dark eyes of French creoles; but&#xD;
there the likeness absolutely ended. Of the&#xD;
two, Madelon Lautrec had the most regular&#xD;
features, the most camellia-like skin, the most&#xD;
magnificent eyes, the most subtle grace of&#xD;
manner; yet few people gave her the palm of&#xD;
beauty over her cousin Ermine St. Amand.&#xD;
What Ermine's special charm was, Heaven&#xD;
only knows, for Heaven alone had given it to&#xD;
her; but a charm she had, undoubtedly worth&#xD;
all the Hellenic noses and Oriental eyes in the&#xD;
world. A slenderly-fashioned, delicately-fea-&#xD;
tured creature, she struck you atfirat-very fra-&#xD;
gile, very dainty, but so full of unspoken coquet-&#xD;
s-ic, that you knew at once shemusthaveFrench&#xD;
blood in her veins. A creature with wonder-&#xD;
ful possibilities of passion and pathos slum-&#xD;
&#xD;
being in the depths of those dark eyes-eyes&#xD;
not half so large or bright as Madelon's, but&#xD;
oh, so tenderly, witchingly soft and quivering&#xD;
about the fiexile, sensitivee lips. The outline&#xD;
of her face would never have served formarbie,&#xD;
but it looked exceedingly well in flesh, and&#xD;
had that exquisite delicacy of modelling which&#xD;
we find only in the Southern races, while her&#xD;
voice had a chord of music in it such as one&#xD;
does not very often hear-a magic sweetness&#xD;
that might have been stolen from the sirens,&#xD;
her admirers said. There was none of this&#xD;
tender charm about Madelon. With all her&#xD;
beauty and all her grace, she was too cold, too&#xD;
proud-often too r9pulsively haughty-to win&#xD;
popular favor. She curled her scarlet lip&#xD;
over this fact, and thought in her young cyni.&#xD;
cism that it was natural enough, since she was&#xD;
"no heiress like Ermine." But, although the&#xD;
world is the world, and heiress-ship is always&#xD;
a first-class recommendation to its favor, other&#xD;
things weigh also in the balance of its verdict.&#xD;
Some natures win their own way, let Fortune&#xD;
do her best or worst-and Ermine's was one&#xD;
of these. In a palace or a hovel, she would&#xD;
still have been one of those favored children&#xD;
of partial Nature-&#xD;
"One handful of whose buoyant chaff&#xD;
Exceeds our hoard of careful grain."&#xD;
"Well," said Madelon, after a while," what&#xD;
am I to tell Aunt Victorine-that you prefer&#xD;
to spend the day 'on a lone rock by the sea,'&#xD;
or that you are coming home? I must return,&#xD;
for I promised Margaret to go out shopping&#xD;
with her, and I know she is waiting for me."&#xD;
"I will go back also," said Ermine, with&#xD;
unexpected docility. "There is no good in&#xD;
staying here; though Ido think mamma might&#xD;
have left me alone."&#xD;
"When you grow a little older, you will&#xD;
find that nobody ever is left alone," said Made.&#xD;
lon, philosophically. "We are all worried&#xD;
more or less by our affectionate relatives; and&#xD;
-Is that Mr. Sexton yonder? I wonderwhat&#xD;
he is doing here at this hour of the day?&#xD;
Come !-if we stay five minutes longer, we&#xD;
shall have to undergo a catechism about Mar.&#xD;
garret's health and appearance."&#xD;
"Perhaps he has come to loiter about until&#xD;
it is late enough for a call," hazar~led Ermine.&#xD;
"He looks as if he meant something serious-&#xD;
don't you think so?"&#xD;
"He looks as if he were loaded to the brim&#xD;
with a proposal, and ready to ~plode at any&#xD;
moment," said Madelon. "Grace d .DiesI&#xD;

"'HE COMET NOT1' SHE SAID."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
Poor as I am, would I marry a man who came&#xD;
to offer himself to me in such a coat as that?"&#xD;
"I fancy Margaret will give him his 'route'&#xD;
as summarily as you could desire," said Ermine,&#xD;
laughing.&#xD;
"His 'route'!" repeated, the other. "Is&#xD;
that all you know about it? But hush !-here&#xD;
he comes. Don't be stopped, if you can help&#xD;
it."&#xD;
Here he came indeed--a short, stout man,&#xD;
of florid complexion, large nose (belonging to&#xD;
the class which partial friends call "Napole-&#xD;
onic"), blond mustache, and coat which&#xD;
merited all of Madelon's scorn, inasmuch as,&#xD;
being too short.waisted, it gave him (why, it is&#xD;
impossible to say) the appearance of an over-&#xD;
grown fr~g. Yet he was not an ugly man, by&#xD;
any means-on the contrary, most people&#xD;
called Mr. Sexton "fine-looking," which is&#xD;
rather an ambiguous term at best. A certain&#xD;
deplorable absence of refl.nementwas his great-&#xD;
est drawback-his personal appearance being&#xD;
strongly suggestive of those Teutonic gentle-&#xD;
men whom we see in any and every beer-gar-&#xD;
den, drinking fabulous quantities of "lager,"&#xD;
and eating fabulous numbers of "pretzels."&#xD;
As far as anybody in America caa know any&#xD;
thing about his antecedents, however, Mr.&#xD;
Sexton knew that he had no Dutch blood in&#xD;
his veins; and when he uncovered his head-&#xD;
showing thereby a considerable spot "where&#xD;
the hair wouldn't grow "'-he addressed the&#xD;
cousins in good English, instead of the German&#xD;
accent one involuntarily expected.&#xD;
"Good-morning, young ladies-I am glad&#xD;
to see you looking so blooming after our dis-&#xD;
sipation la~t night" (heavy gallantry was Mr.&#xD;
Sexton's style when he attempted gallantry at&#xD;
all). "I hope you don't feel very much used&#xD;
up by it?"&#xD;
"Dissipation!" repeated Madelon, with an&#xD;
arch of her scornful brows. "Do you call&#xD;
that festive occasion last night 'dissipation~'&#xD;
Mr. Sexton? I should as soon think of calling&#xD;
strawberry-ice an intoxicating beverage! I&#xD;
don't feel at all used up, thank you-nothing&#xD;
short of a three o'clock German ever does use&#xD;
me up! Perhaps you do not feel so, how-&#xD;
ever."&#xD;
"On the contrary, I feel vepr well indeed,"&#xD;
said Mr. Sexton, coloring a little on top o~ his&#xD;
head. "I-ah-thought we had a very charm-&#xD;
ing evening. Mrs. Fontaine's entertainments&#xD;
are always in excellent style."&#xD;
"I believe she always has an excellent&#xD;
&#xD;
supper," said Madelon, "and that is what&#xD;
gentlemen mostly care about. I did not think&#xD;
the evening charming at all-I thought it&#xD;
horridly stupid.-~Didn't you, Ermine? The&#xD;
music was execrable, and scarcely man worth&#xD;
looking at!"&#xD;
"I thought it tolerably pleasant," said&#xD;
Ermine, feeling her cousin's rudeness, and&#xD;
striving to atone, yet In reality damning poor&#xD;
Mrs. Fontaine's entertainment still more effect-&#xD;
ually by her faint praise. Then-making a&#xD;
headlong plunge into commonplaces-,.-" I see&#xD;
the lovely day has tempted you as well as our-&#xD;
selves to come out and enjoy it, Mr Saxton."&#xD;
"Ah-yes----it is very pretty," said Mr.&#xD;
Sexton, looking round and benignly patronizing&#xD;
the day. "I intended to take a stroll until&#xD;
the hour for morning calls," he went on.&#xD;
"Then I hoped for the pleasure of inquiring&#xD;
how you ladies were. That I see is unneces-&#xD;
sary; but Mrs. ErIe and Miss Erie-"&#xD;
"Are both quite well, thanks," interrupted&#xD;
Madelon, tapping her foot with ill-restrained&#xD;
impatience to be gone. "Ermine, we had bet-&#xD;
ter not detain Mr. Sexton any longer."&#xD;
"Detain me!" said Mr Saxton, gallantly.&#xD;
"So far from that, if you are going home and&#xD;
will allow me-"&#xD;
"No, thanks," cried Madelon, hastily;&#xD;
"we are not going home-that is, not imme-&#xD;
diately. But no doubt you will find Aunt&#xD;
Victorine and Margaret in, it' you care to in-&#xD;
quire whether or not they are 'used up.'-Er-&#xD;
mine, we shall be late, I am afraid.-Good-&#xD;
morning, Mr. Sexton."&#xD;
Hasty bows on both sides. Mr. Sexton&#xD;
continues his stroll with a faint sensation of&#xD;
having been snubbed, and a decided impres-&#xD;
sion that "that Miss Lautrec" is a very dis-&#xD;
agreeable young person. Ermine is hurried&#xD;
off down the first flight of steps, and then says,&#xD;
indignantly:&#xD;
"Madden, I am ashamed of you! Why'&#xD;
did you treat the poor man so rudely? It is&#xD;
not his fault that-that-"&#xD;
"That he is hateful and tiresome and con-&#xD;
ceited?" said Madden. "No, I suppose not;&#xD;
but it is Margaret's business to bear him, not&#xD;
mine-and I certainly don't mean to do volun-&#xD;
teer work. Jusle Ciel! how heavy on hand&#xD;
she will find him for the rest of her natural&#xD;
life!"&#xD;
"She will neu'er marry him," said Ermine.&#xD;
"I would risk any thing on that"&#xD;
"Indeed!" returned Madelon, saceringly.&#xD;
&#xD;
11~&#xD;
&#xD;
"Then I don't mind laying a wager with you.&#xD;
Precious as my necklace is to me, I will put it&#xD;
up against any thing you please, that Mar-&#xD;
garet is engaged to Mr. Sexton within-well, I&#xD;
will give myself a wide margin, and say three&#xD;
days. She may hold out a little while against&#xD;
the powers that be, but her contumacy won't&#xD;
be of long duration."&#xD;
"I don't believe it!" said Ermine, deter-&#xD;
minedly. "You foget-Raymond!"&#xD;
"Raymond!" repeated the other, in aston-&#xD;
ishment. She turned, looked at her compan-&#xD;
ion, and then burst into a, laugh. "I beg&#xD;
your pardon, my dear, but indeed you ought&#xD;
to be put under a glass case and labelled 'In-&#xD;
genui.' If itwere not yourself, I should think&#xD;
you were a most consummate hypocrite, but as&#xD;
it is - why, have you no eyes, no ears, no&#xD;
quickness of perception? Don't you see that&#xD;
Raymond is sick and tired of Margaret, and&#xD;
that he is straining every nerve to get her mar-&#xD;
ried and out of his way?"&#xD;
"Out of his way! how is she in his&#xD;
way?"&#xD;
"Ermine, don't try my credulity too far,"&#xD;
said Madelon, with her cynical smile - the&#xD;
smile which had come from overmuch study&#xD;
of ]3alzac and George Sand, coupled with a&#xD;
natural ability to catch the undercurrent of&#xD;
life-" you are a woman, not .a child. You&#xD;
must see and linow that Raymond means to&#xD;
marry you."&#xD;
Surge went a tide of carnation over Er-&#xD;
mine's clear, white skin-flash came a gleam&#xD;
of something like fire into her soft, dark&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
"I am a woman," she said; "not a child&#xD;
to be bartered away, or given away, Madelon.&#xD;
Raymond is not such a fool as to 'mean' to&#xD;
marry a woman who would never be induced&#xD;
to marry him."&#xD;
"I am not much of a phrenologist," said&#xD;
Madelon, carelessly, "but it seems to me that&#xD;
I have only to look at Raymond's 'head or face,&#xD;
or whatever it is that kind of people profess&#xD;
to judge by, to see that he never made a plan&#xD;
yet-and gave it up."&#xD;
"Then he had better not make any plan&#xD;
with regard to me," saidErmine, with decisive&#xD;
hauteu,-.&#xD;
Mademoiselle Lautrec shrugged her shapely&#xD;
shoulders once more.&#xD;
"I sometimes think Raymond has taken&#xD;
for his own the motto of Philip of Spain-&#xD;
'Time and I against any 'two,'" she said.&#xD;
&#xD;

"He will be a great man some of these dayw&#xD;
-if he doesn't overreach himself or die be-&#xD;
forehand. Those are the two lions in the paths.&#xD;
of most clever men. If I were in your place,&#xD;
Ermine, I think I should take him. There are&#xD;
possibilities of something more than ordinary&#xD;
in him; and that is more than can be said of&#xD;
the majority of men."&#xD;
"Then why don't you take him yourself? "&#xD;
said Ermine, magnanimously.&#xD;
"I! "-lifting the white eyelids from her&#xD;
magnificent eyes. "What are you thinking of?&#xD;
It is very rn-bred to make personal application.&#xD;
of one's remarks. I am Madelon Lautrec,,&#xD;
with my face for ~ny fortune; and unfortu..&#xD;
lately that species of capital is not recognized&#xD;
on 'Change. You are Mademoiselle St. Amand,,&#xD;
the West-Indian heiress, with-&#xD;
'A very fine fortune-when told In centlines "'-&#xD;
interrupted Ermine, smiling. "Ne'eer mind,&#xD;
Madelon-little or great, in a few months I&#xD;
shall be the legal possessor of it. I can go&#xD;
and live with my dear guardian, in my dear&#xD;
Martinique!"&#xD;
"An entrancing prospect, truly! " said&#xD;
Madelon, dryly. "I wonder how long your en-&#xD;
thusiasm for your dear Martinique will last.&#xD;
after you get there? Here we are, however-&#xD;
and now I must tell Aunt 'Vietorine about Mr.&#xD;
Sexton, so that she can keep Margaret at.&#xD;
home."&#xD;
"Tell Margaret," suggested Ermine," and&#xD;
see what she will do."&#xD;
"Margaret has more sense than you give.&#xD;
her credit for," said Madelon, coolly. "If I did&#xD;
tell her, I think she would-stay."&#xD;
They had by this time reached one of the&#xD;
prettiest and most attractive of those charming&#xD;
Battery villas-for villas they certainly are in&#xD;
appearance, whether defined thus or not-.&#xD;
which are the admiration of every stranger&#xD;
visiting Charleston. The lives of those who&#xD;
inhabit them must certainly have fallen in.&#xD;
pleasant places, we think, as we sit and gaze&#xD;
at them from the flickering shade that falls&#xD;
athwart some tempting bench. But, after ally,&#xD;
is it not rather deceptive work, this judging the.&#xD;
lives of people by the outside of' their habita-&#xD;
tions? Few dwellings could have looked more.&#xD;
airy, mOre elegant, more redolent of all things&#xD;
essential to happiness, than the stately house&#xD;
of many galleries, balconies, and bay-windows,&#xD;
before which the cousins paused; and yet--&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
A CILLRMING CILtTELAINE.&#xD;
MADELON walked directly into the house,&#xD;
but Ermine paused a minute before entering,&#xD;
and gazed back wistfully at the shining waters&#xD;
from the side of which she had come. The&#xD;
windows of the house di&amp;amp; not overlook the&#xD;
harbor, but fronted instead on that lovely&#xD;
Battery square which was now wearing its&#xD;
brightest livery of emerald-green, the shell&#xD;
road gleaming white through intervening ~er-&#xD;
dure, the blue waters of the Ashley beyond,&#xD;
and the wooded shores of James Island robed&#xD;
in tender, mist-like haze. It was a day of se-&#xD;
rene and heavenly calm-a day of golden&#xD;
splendor, "astray from paradise "-a day on&#xD;
which it seemed as if happiness must descend&#xD;
from that distant sapphire sky, like God's own&#xD;
angel, sent to bless all eager, yearning human&#xD;
hearts.&#xD;
"If he would only come, it would all be&#xD;
so perfect l"the girl said half aloud.&#xD;
And by" all" she did not mean any human&#xD;
influences, but only this fair, bright Nature,&#xD;
who wore her royal beauty like a smiling&#xD;
bride-Nature, whose joyous bidding s/ic felt in&#xD;
every fibre, hut whom she could not heed, with&#xD;
whom she could not rejoice, while her perverse,&#xD;
longing heart flew like a bird far away over the&#xD;
waters. Something-a shade, as it were-came&#xD;
to her face, as she turned and followed Made-&#xD;
ion across a frescoed, marble-paved hall into a&#xD;
sitting-room which was simply a model of what&#xD;
a sitting-room should be-not very sumptuous,&#xD;
but luxurious and charming in the extreme.&#xD;
At one end a bay-window overlooked the&#xD;
street; just opposite the door two large French&#xD;
windows opened on a' gallery, which, in turn,&#xD;
"gave" 6n a flower-garden. The fragrance of&#xD;
roses and jasmine came in through the 'open&#xD;
w and filled the bowery room&#xD;
Like sweet thoughts in a dream,"&#xD;
while the garden itself seemed a wilderness of&#xD;
bloom, a paradise of roses, clustering, hanging,&#xD;
twining everywhere, of graceful arches and&#xD;
trellises draped with vines, of trees with deep-&#xD;
green, glossy leaves, and white flowering&#xD;
shrubs. In furniture the apartment was some-&#xD;
&#xD;
what nondescript. There was a piano in one&#xD;
corner, a carved bookcase in another, a broad,&#xD;
low, easy couch in a third, lounging-chairs in-&#xD;
numerable, pictures, brackets, vases full of cut&#xD;
flowers, and a centre-table covered with books,&#xD;
work, periodicals, and newspapers. Across the&#xD;
hail was a suite of apartments said to be the&#xD;
most perfect in Charleston-rooms full of&#xD;
white statues, rare pictures, and gleaming mir-&#xD;
rors; but all kabitu~s of the house preferred&#xD;
this pretty boudoir with-its charming mixture&#xD;
of comfort and refinement, and regarded it as&#xD;
a special compliment to be admitted here. One&#xD;
thing about the room struck the most inatten-&#xD;
tive observer in marked degree: it was impos-&#xD;
sible to enter it without perceiving at a glance&#xD;
that it was accustomed to enshrine the pres-&#xD;
ence of some woman more than ordinarily&#xD;
gifted with the refinement and grace which,&#xD;
above all else, make a woman lovely in the&#xD;
sight of man.&#xD;
And such a woman was standing in one of&#xD;
the French windows, giving some directions to&#xD;
the gardener about the training of a vine, when&#xD;
Madelon entered. A very fine and gracious&#xD;
lady. That was your first impression of Mrs.&#xD;
Erie, and, if you saw her twenty times a day,&#xD;
you were never tempted to alter that opinion.&#xD;
Whether or not she were beautiful, you did not&#xD;
pause to inquire; who ever does, when that&#xD;
nameless charm of manner, that unconscious&#xD;
magnetism of glance, which only a few rare&#xD;
women possess, is brought to bear on the&#xD;
startled yet acquiescent senses? But, if once&#xD;
forced to cold-blooded scrutiny, you found that&#xD;
Mrs. Erie stood the test of criticism as well as&#xD;
she stood the test of every thing else. Not&#xD;
strictly beautiful, perhaps-.--how few are I-but&#xD;
handsome, distinguished, and most unexcep-&#xD;
tionably thorough-bred in appearance-a wom-&#xD;
an who looked as if only the bluest of "blue&#xD;
blood" could possibly flow in her delicate&#xD;
azure veins. To describe her in detail would&#xD;
be impossible-for she was prei~minently a&#xD;
woman who lost by being "picked to pieces"&#xD;
-but, taken as a whole, she was thoroughly&#xD;
harmonious, thoroughly graceful, and thor-&#xD;
oughly fascinating to women as well as men.~&#xD;
She finished her directions before she&#xD;
looked round-giving them in a clear, pure&#xD;
voice, full of that indescribable modulation of&#xD;
refinement which is the despair of those who&#xD;
do' not catch it in early childhood-then&#xD;
turned and advanced into the room as Made.&#xD;
ion was saying-&#xD;
&#xD;
"I wish I was as sure of a great many&#xD;
things 'I should like to know as that he wrn&#xD;
ring the door-bell the moment the clock strikes&#xD;
the last stroke of twelve."&#xD;
"He will not find me at home, then," re-&#xD;
sponded a petulant voice from the cushions of&#xD;
the couch, where an amber-haired, white-robed&#xD;
divinity reclined, in an attif'ude that might&#xD;
have served for the "Persia~ girl" whom Mr.&#xD;
Tennyson saw in his excursion up the Tigris,&#xD;
to "Bagdad's shrines of fretted gold."&#xD;
This was "the beautiful Miss Erie "-a&#xD;
radiant bird-of-paradise, over whom men raved,&#xD;
and of whom women steered clear, conscious&#xD;
that her brilliant fairness simply "killed" all&#xD;
lesser charms. Even stately, handsome Made-&#xD;
ion looked almost plain beside her, perfect as&#xD;
she was in every outline of feature, and daz-&#xD;
zling in all the bewildering tints that make&#xD;
blond beauty so captivating to the eye.&#xD;
plc had likened Margaret Erie to every goddess&#xD;
of antiquity and every poetical saint in the&#xD;
calendar, until Margaret, well aware of this&#xD;
fact, esteemed it a point of conscience to pose&#xD;
accordingly. It was incumbent upon her&#xD;
never to be out of drawing, as artists say, to&#xD;
be always ready as an inspiration for a poet,&#xD;
or a study for a painter; so, from sheer force&#xD;
of habit, she sank into a graceful attitude if&#xD;
nobody more important than a canary was by;&#xD;
and even arranged herself with due regard to&#xD;
picturesque effect when she retired to her&#xD;
chamber to sleep. If Miss Erie's undeniable&#xD;
beauty was, in consequence, a little spoiled by&#xD;
self-consciousness, it was scarcely wonderful.&#xD;
A young lady cannot conveniently be "Idalian&#xD;
Aphrodite," Calypso, Hebe, St. Cecilia, all the&#xD;
Graces, the whole family of the Muses, and&#xD;
herself~ into the bargain. Somebody must&#xD;
necessarily suffer in the matter; and that&#xD;
somebody is generally herself. At present&#xD;
Miss Erie was enthroned like an odaliek,&#xD;
amid cushions, the soft-blue tint of which en-&#xD;
hanced the transparent fairness of her com-&#xD;
plexion, showed to advantage the pure, paly-&#xD;
gold of her hair, and made an efl'eetive back-&#xD;
ground for her clear Greek profile-a fair,&#xD;
languid enchantress, whose manifest delight it&#xD;
was to ensnare men's souls in, the meshes of&#xD;
her glittering tresses, and drown them in the&#xD;
depths of her violet eyes-but an enchantress&#xD;
most potent when she was silent, least likely&#xD;
to c~aarm when she spoke. After all, Nature&#xD;
is less capricious in the distribution of her&#xD;
gifts than we are sometimes tempted to ima-&#xD;
&#xD;
CHATELAINE.                           13&#xD;
gine. The most fascinating women are not gen-&#xD;
erally the most beautiful, and rarely indeed are&#xD;
the most bea~tWul the most fi~scinating It is&#xD;
not so much a heart as a - d that dolls gen.&#xD;
emily lack, not so m~e power to attract&#xD;
as the power to reta~$; for, regular features&#xD;
and "sun-kissed" hair are pretty enough in&#xD;
the abstract, but not always charming in the&#xD;
concrete.&#xD;
"Who will not find you at home?" asked&#xD;
Mrs. Brie, turning round. Then, as Margaret&#xD;
kept silence, "Of whom are you speaking,&#xD;
Madelon ?"&#xD;
"Of Mr. Sexton," answered Madelon.&#xD;
"We met him on tjie Battery, and I was just&#xD;
telling Margaret teat he means to call, and&#xD;
'hopes to find Miss Erie at home.'"&#xD;
will be disappointed, then," said Miss&#xD;
must go out to do some shopping. I&#xD;
thought you were never coming, MadelonY&#xD;
"Your admirer detained me, my dear,"&#xD;
said Madelon. "Perhaps you bad better think&#xD;
twice about going out, for he has plainly&#xD;
screwed his courage to the sticking-point, and&#xD;
means to take advantage of it before it oozes&#xD;
out at his fingers, like that of Bob Acres. I&#xD;
would not for the world hurt your feelings,&#xD;
but his appearance strongly reminded me of&#xD;
that charming old ballad about&#xD;
'Afrog he would a wooing go,&#xD;
Ileigh-ho, says Rowley!&#xD;
Whether his mother would let him or no,&#xD;
Heigh-ho, says Rowley!'&#xD;
"What was the fate of the frog, by-the-by?&#xD;
I don't remember."&#xD;
"Pretty much what will be the fate of Mr.&#xD;
Sexton, if he chooses to make a fool of him-&#xD;
self, I presume," retorted Margaret, irefully;&#xD;
"for it is provoking to have one's admirers de.&#xD;
predated, even if one does not mean to marry&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"Madelon, flippancy is a very undesirable&#xD;
accomplishment for a young lady," said- Mrs.&#xD;
Erie's clear voice, a little coldly. "Mr. Sax-&#xD;
ton is a very pleasant gentleman, and if he han&#xD;
said that he means to call, I hope, my dear"&#xD;
(this to Margaret), "that you will defer your&#xD;
shopping, and be at home to receive him."&#xD;
A dark cloud of sullen obstinacy came over&#xD;
the lovely blond face, as we may see it come&#xD;
over many faces of just that "angelic" type.&#xD;
Perhaps it is this fact which makes one secret..&#xD;
ly incredulous concerning the prevailing fair.-&#xD;
ness of the celestial hosts. At all events, let&#xD;
us hope that, when we get to heaven, we shall&#xD;

&#xD;
see some faces as dark, and bright, and frank,&#xD;
as we have seen on earth, and we can ask no&#xD;
more, either for them or for ourselves.&#xD;
"I believe I should prefer to do my shop-&#xD;
ping, thank you, mamma," said Miss Erie, un.&#xD;
gratefully. "If you think Mr. Sexton so&#xD;
pleasant, you know you can receive him your-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
"I shall certainly receive him myself,"&#xD;
answered Mrs. Erie, quietly. "You know me&#xD;
well enough to be sure that I am never guilty&#xD;
of any thing so improper, or in such atrocious&#xD;
style, as to allow you to receive alone a man&#xD;
who has never declared himself. Indeed, I'&#xD;
'shall make it a point that Madelon and Ermine&#xD;
'see him also."&#xD;
"I think, ma tante, you can afford to let&#xD;
me 9ff duty," said Madelon, with her mocking&#xD;
smile. "Mr. Sexton and I have already&#xD;
exchanged compliments, and I told him-a&#xD;
shocking story, by-the-way-that I was not&#xD;
coming home. He will not expect to be glad.&#xD;
dened by my presence, I assure you."&#xD;
"Ermine, then. But where is she? Did&#xD;
you not request her to come home?"&#xD;
"Mere I am, mamma," said Ermine, en-&#xD;
tering at the moment. Do you want me?"&#xD;
"Yes, I want you-or, rather, I don't&#xD;
want you to stand on the Battery and tan your&#xD;
complexion, or take a sunstroke," said Mrs.&#xD;
Eric. "Your face is quite flushed now-you,&#xD;
who never have a color I Ermine, this must&#xD;
really stop."&#xD;
"What must really stop, mamma?" asked&#xD;
Ermine, sitting down with a sigh. "It is de-&#xD;
lightful out on the Battery; such a fresh&#xD;
breeze blowing that it is much cooler than in&#xD;
here; and as my for taking a sunstroke, I am&#xD;
about as likely to take the plague. I was only&#xD;
looking for-for Alan's ship."&#xD;
"So I supposed, and therefore I sent for&#xD;
you. You know my wishes on that subject,&#xD;
Ermine; andt yet you openly and perversely&#xD;
disregard them. What am Ito think of such&#xD;
conduct?"&#xD;
"Indeed, I don't know, mamma," said Er-&#xD;
mine; and the words, which might have been&#xD;
impertinent, were in truth only weary. Evi-&#xD;
dently much had been said on the subject-so&#xD;
much that, to one at least, it had become en-&#xD;
tirely exhausted and entirely distasteful.&#xD;
The stately, gracious lady flushed, and&#xD;
~gave her daughter a glance in which it might&#xD;
have proved hard to tell whether impatience&#xD;
.or contempt was most strikingly apparent.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Perhaps you are not aware that your&#xD;
habits are already the subject of much re-&#xD;
mark," she said. "You forget that you are&#xD;
well known, and that it is impossible to stand&#xD;
on tha Battery with an opera.glass at your&#xD;
eyes for several hours every day without at-&#xD;
tracting attention. Only last night Mrs. Law-&#xD;
son had the impertinence to ask me if you&#xD;
were not engaged to that disrep-that unfor-&#xD;
tunate young man who is the captain of a&#xD;
trading-vessel."&#xD;
"Somebody asked me thc same thing,"&#xD;
cried Margaret. "I-I never was more angry&#xD;
in my life! I think Ermine might remember&#xD;
that she compromises all the rest of the family&#xD;
by her conduct."&#xD;
"She compromises herself much more se-&#xD;
riously than any one else," said Mrs. Erie's&#xD;
quiet, incisive voice. "Such a damaging re-&#xD;
port once circulated is never forgotten; and&#xD;
there is no telling how ch it may affect a&#xD;
girl's establishment in ii ."&#xD;
Ermine is mute-suddenly and strangely&#xD;
mute. A flush, deeper than that which her&#xD;
mother had remarked a moment before, dyes&#xD;
her clear, white skin, while the downcast lids&#xD;
veil effectually the averted eyes. As she sits&#xD;
by the table, tracing with one dainty boot an&#xD;
arabesque pattern on a Persian rug under her&#xD;
feet, she is a picture of obstinate defiance, they&#xD;
all think.&#xD;
"There is Alice Stapleton," said Margaret,&#xD;
who often spoke when it would have been&#xD;
wiser to keep silence, and whose illustrations&#xD;
were not always strikingly in point," who ever&#xD;
forgets that she was about to elope with a&#xD;
dancing-master when she was at school? Of&#xD;
course she is very nice now, but I don't be-&#xD;
lieve anybody worth speaking of will ever&#xD;
marry her."&#xD;
"And do you call Alice Stapleton's dis-&#xD;
graceful affair a parallel to my affection for&#xD;
Alan-Alan, whom I love better than any-&#xD;
body in the world except my dear guar-&#xD;
dian?" asked Ermine, lifting her eyes all&#xD;
ablaze with indignation, and fixing them on&#xD;
the speaker.&#xD;
"For that matter, I call a dancing-master&#xD;
infinitely superior to a sea-captain any time,~~&#xD;
retorted Margaret, whose forte was any thing&#xD;
in the world but amiability. "Gentlemen are&#xD;
dancing-masters sometimes-at least one reads&#xD;
of such things."&#xD;
"And are gentlemen never sea~captains?~~&#xD;
demanded Ermine, with ominous calm. "I&#xD;
&#xD;
shall be very much obliged to you for a defi~&#xD;
nite answer to that question."&#xD;
Before Margaret could comply with this&#xD;
moderate request, Mrs. Erie interposed.&#xD;
"I am ashamed of you both,~~ she said.&#xD;
"Is this a mode for two well-bred people to&#xD;
discuss any subject? Ermine, it is useless to&#xD;
attempt reasonable argument with you, I per-&#xD;
ceive; but lam your mother, even if I am not&#xD;
your guardian, and t request" (a strong accent&#xD;
here) "that you will refrain from looking for&#xD;
Alan's ship, where all Charleston can see and&#xD;
comment on your folly."&#xD;
"It is folly, no doubt, mamma, for it does&#xD;
not bring him any sooner-I can stay at&#xD;
home," Ermine answered, quietly.&#xD;
This unusual submission took her audience&#xD;
quite by surprise. Even Madelon looked at&#xD;
her for a moment somewhat astonished, and a&#xD;
little suspicious. What did it mean? Usually&#xD;
she fought d l'outrance over any point where&#xD;
"Alan" was even distantly concerned; and&#xD;
now to give up this indulgence was singularly&#xD;
without precedent, to say the least.&#xD;
For a fortnight past, her feverish anxiety&#xD;
concerning his coming had grown day by day,&#xD;
and at all hours she and her opera-glass had&#xD;
haunted the Battery, until almost any mother&#xD;
in Charleston would have esteemed Mrs. Erie&#xD;
amply justified in decidedly "putting a stop&#xD;
to it," as Mrs. Erie at last resolved to do. She&#xD;
had resolved it, however, with sundry misgiv-&#xD;
ings concerning the probable consequences of&#xD;
rebellion; and this unconditional surrender&#xD;
was therefore most unexpectedly gratifying.&#xD;
"Now, that is sensible-a very rare thing&#xD;
with you," she said, approvingly. "I cannot&#xD;
understand this sentimental fancy about Alan.&#xD;
That seems to be the weakest point of your&#xD;
character, Ermine. I wonder it never strikes&#xD;
you what he may think of it."&#xD;
"What may he think of it?" asked Er-&#xD;
mine, with level, half-defiant eyes.&#xD;
Mrs. ErIe returned the gaze quietly, but,&#xD;
when she spoke, every word dropped with&#xD;
mercilessly cool decision on the three pairs of&#xD;
listening ears:&#xD;
"He may think he has made a conquest of&#xD;
a foolish girl, who has not sufficient self-re-&#xD;
spect to conceal her folly."&#xD;
"Mamma!'~ It was a choking cry of in-&#xD;
dignation-a cry that absolutely made Mar-&#xD;
garet start among her downy blue cushions-...&#xD;
~' mamma, how dare you speak so to me?"&#xD;
"Ermine, have you lost'your senses, that&#xD;
&#xD;
you dare ~to speak so to mc 9" asked her&#xD;
mother, sternly.&#xD;
Ermine gave a great gasp, shivered from&#xD;
head to foot, then, locking her hands tightly&#xD;
together, grew suddenly and rigidly calm.&#xD;
"I beg your pardon," she said. "When&#xD;
one is insulted, one does not stop to think&#xD;
who offered the insult. Perhaps that may ex-&#xD;
cuse me. But "-her eyes lightened here-&#xD;
"if you think to estrange me from Alan by&#xD;
such taunts as this, you are mistaken. I love&#xD;
him too dearly, I trust him too entirely, to be-&#xD;
lieve that he would ever do me such injustice&#xD;
as to think any-any thing like that! .ll~&#xD;
knows how I love hi~n-he and God-for any&#xD;
one else, it does not matter. I am used to&#xD;
misconception - especially from you -for I&#xD;
have never had any thing else as long as I can&#xD;
remember."&#xD;
"And I am used to that charge," said&#xD;
Mrs. Erie, with dignity. "Fortunately, my own&#xD;
conscience acquits me of it; and any one, who&#xD;
has ever known any thing of your rash and&#xD;
headstrong nature, will acquit me also,"&#xD;
"Then let me go to my guardian-my dear&#xD;
guardian," said Ermine, quivering. "He has&#xD;
some love for me, some patience with me."&#xD;
"If I allowed you to go to that foolish old&#xD;
man, I don't know what point your indiscre-&#xD;
tion would reach," said Mrs. Erie, coldly. "As&#xD;
it is, your recklessness and insubordination&#xD;
make the principal trouble of my life."&#xD;
"I am sorry for it," said Ermine; "but&#xD;
perhafs-who knows ?-it may not be for&#xD;
long. I am sure, for your sake, I hope it&#xD;
may end very soon,~~&#xD;
She spoke the last words half dreamily;&#xD;
then took her hat from the table where she&#xD;
had laid it, and walked out of the room, across&#xD;
the hail, and up the broad, easy staircase.&#xD;
There was silence in the bowery-room until&#xD;
the last echo of her footsteps died away.&#xD;
Then Mrs. Erie said:&#xD;
"Nobody who has not suffered in the same&#xD;
manner could credit the anxiety which Ermine&#xD;
has been to me from her childhood. She cer-&#xD;
tainly has the most unfortunately tenacious&#xD;
nature I have ever known. To think that, af-&#xD;
ter all these years, she should still cling to&#xD;
that disagreeable guardian of hers, and this&#xD;
disreputable nephew of my husband's, who&#xD;
was once kind to her in a careless, boyish&#xD;
fashion ~"&#xD;
"She would undergo torture and death&#xD;
for either of them," said Madelon, "Isn't it&#xD;

&#xD;
remarkable? One would think that dresses,&#xD;
and admirers, and all that sort of thing, would&#xD;
not leave her any spare time or spare thought&#xD;
to waste on such subjects. Do you know,"&#xD;
pursued the young lady, "I don't think Ermine&#xD;
is exactly like other people, Aunt Victorine?&#xD;
She is so very queer-queerer, by far, than&#xD;
you knpw-that she always seems to me like&#xD;
one of the people who are said to be marked&#xD;
out for uncommon uses-tragedy, passion, de-&#xD;
spair, and all that sort of thing."&#xD;
"I beg you won't put any such romantic&#xD;
nonsense into her head," said Mrs. ErIe, coldly.&#xD;
"Sh4~ly lacks common-sense now."&#xD;
"Iput romantic nonsense into anybody's&#xD;
head?" said Madelon. "That would be a&#xD;
saul among the prophets indeed! But I&#xD;
think you will find an abundance of it in Er-&#xD;
mine's brain without any assistance from me."&#xD;
"She told me yesterday that as soon as&#xD;
she is of age she means to go to Germany and&#xD;
study art," said Margaret, in exactly the same&#xD;
tone she might have employed to announce an&#xD;
intention to go to the penitentiary and break&#xD;
stones.&#xD;
"She is hopelessly absurd," said Mrs.&#xD;
Erle, with a sigh, "and I really think her&#xD;
guardian is accountable for a great deal of&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"As for her painting," said Madelon, who&#xD;
seemed rather inclined to take the part of dev-&#xD;
il's advocate, "I don't see that it does much&#xD;
harm to any thing except her dresses. I sup-&#xD;
pose you know that she has ruined her prettyy&#xD;
blue organdie with paint-stains, by-the-way?"&#xD;
"11cr affection for her guardian is the&#xD;
most incomprehensible thing to me," said Mrs.&#xD;
Erle, whose mind naturally ran on the griev-&#xD;
ance which was most a grievance to her. "lie&#xD;
is really the most disa~greeable old man I ever&#xD;
knew. I often wonder what induced my hus-&#xD;
band to choose such a person-but the ways&#xD;
of husbands are incomprehensible. If he meant&#xD;
to leave me a posthumous annoyance, he could&#xD;
not have done so more completely; for the&#xD;
trouble Colonel Vivicux has caused me about&#xD;
Ermine's fortune and Ermine's self is almost&#xD;
beyond belief."&#xD;
"What a charming thing it is, to be sure,&#xD;
when one has no fortune to necessitate a guar-&#xD;
dian, and prove a source of trouble to one's&#xD;
friends!" said Madelon. "For these and all&#xD;
other mercies, let us thank Providence !-&#xD;
Come, Margaret-if you mean to lie there all&#xD;
day, Imust go down-street."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Margaret is going to stay at home," said&#xD;
Mrs. ErIe. "I specially request it."&#xD;
"Indeed, mamma, I am not," said Marga.&#xD;
ret. "I-I don't care a straw about seeing&#xD;
Mr. Sexton."&#xD;
"But you do care about showing your&#xD;
pretty face on King Street, don't you?" said&#xD;
Madelon, laughing. "One admirer at home is&#xD;
certainly not to be compared to fifty abroad."&#xD;
"Madelon, I wish you would let me alone!"&#xD;
cried Margaret, wrathfully. "I kave to go&#xD;
and see the dress-maker about my green silk;&#xD;
you know I can't trust you to do it"&#xD;
"Quite right, too, my dear, for I might&#xD;
order a flounce additional, or a ruffle less,&#xD;
which would break your heart," said Madelon.&#xD;
"I shall order the carriage, and drive with&#xD;
you to see about the dress, after Mr. Sexton's&#xD;
call," said Mrs. Erie, who knew that, if it came&#xD;
to the point of the green silk, concession was&#xD;
absolutely necessary. "That will be better&#xD;
than walking in the hot sun. We will see,&#xD;
too, about the point-lace cape you have set&#xD;
your heart on, but "-as Margaret's turquoise&#xD;
eyes began to gleam with pleasure-" I must&#xD;
really insist on your changing that wrapper&#xD;
for a dress in which you can properly receive&#xD;
Mr. Sexton."&#xD;
After a few remonstrances, Margaret yield-&#xD;
ed with a very bad grace, and retired to ef-&#xD;
fect the desired change of toilet. Then Mrs.&#xD;
Erle leaned back and sighed wearily.&#xD;
"What a happy day it will be to me when&#xD;
that girl is safely married!" she said. "Noth-&#xD;
ing short of the point-lace bribe would have&#xD;
induced her to see this man; and yet-" She&#xD;
broke off abruptly here. "Madelon, if you&#xD;
are going down-street, I wish you would take&#xD;
Louise with you, and get her that pair of blue-&#xD;
kid gaiters which she is determined to have.&#xD;
I am tired of hearing her fret for them."&#xD;
"I saw Nathalle with Louise and Regy on&#xD;
the Battery," said Madelon. "If I meet them,&#xD;
I will take la petite with me. .Pauvre tanle,"&#xD;
added the girl, half compassionately, half&#xD;
mockingly; "even Louise, at the mature age&#xD;
of nine, begins to worry you. I really believe&#xD;
I am the only consolation you have!"&#xD;
"You certainly give me the least trouble&#xD;
of any," said Mrs. ErIe, kissing the ripe, scar.&#xD;
let lips that bent over her.&#xD;
Yet, after Madelon left the room, and the&#xD;
hall-door closed on her, the speaker shook her&#xD;
head.&#xD;
"The time for it has not come quite yet,"&#xD;
&#xD;
she said, addressing a royal lily placed in a&#xD;
taIl, slender vase before her; but I should not&#xD;
be surprised if the trouble she gave in the end&#xD;
was the worst trouble of all."&#xD;
Just then a peal of the door-bell echoed&#xD;
through the house, and the lady made haste&#xD;
to smooth her face in readiness for the visitor&#xD;
whom it heralded. "Show Mr. Sexton in,&#xD;
John," she said, as a servant entered with a&#xD;
card, "and 'not at home' to any one else&#xD;
while he is here."&#xD;
After all, is it worth while to envy the&#xD;
charming cladtelaine her beautiful house-&#xD;
"With its porcelain and pIvhire~, and flower,,"&#xD;
or would not "a dinner of herbs," where love&#xD;
abounded, and scheming was unknown, be&#xD;
rather preferable?&#xD;

CHAPTER IlL&#xD;
HADELON GIVES ADVICE.&#xD;
THE soft, fragrant May dusk has fallen&#xD;
over the blooming land and the shining&#xD;
waters, the divine glory of the western sky&#xD;
has faded away, and only a faint glow lingers&#xD;
over the broad rivers, the calm harbor, the&#xD;
glittering spires of the city, and the great,&#xD;
distant, placid ocean. The afternoon throng,&#xD;
which makes the Battery for eight months in&#xD;
the year one of the most charming pleasure-&#xD;
resorts in the country, has gradually dispersed&#xD;
and gone its way, to gather round countless&#xD;
tin-tables, and discuss all the choice bits of&#xD;
news, social and political, which "fly about in&#xD;
the sunshine like gay little motes," at .any&#xD;
such popular and universal lounging-place-a&#xD;
place where one can see the whole beau.&#xD;
monocle on dress-parade, for the mere trouble&#xD;
of sauntering to and fro in the bright sun-&#xD;
shine, with the water sending soft tones of&#xD;
music into one's ear, the fresh sea-breeze&#xD;
bringing fresh color into one's face, the lovely&#xD;
panorama of sea and shore spread before&#xD;
one's eyes-the purple islands, the distant&#xD;
forts, the broad expanse of sparkling water,&#xD;
the whole perfect picture, in front of which,&#xD;
"-as though sprung from the waves she has cleft,&#xD;
Grim Sumter frowns out o'er the sea."&#xD;
It was at just that witching hour of the&#xD;
twenty-four when a mantle of twilight, edged&#xD;
with the silvery lustre of a new moon and&#xD;
2&#xD;
&#xD;
countless glittering stars, falls over the fair&#xD;
scene, that Madelon Lautrec, parting with one&#xD;
or two gay companions at the door of her&#xD;
aunt's house, entered and ran through the&#xD;
brilliantly-lighted hall straight up-stairs. She&#xD;
did not pause at the door of her own chamber,&#xD;
but passed on and knocked at that of Ermine,&#xD;
which adjoined it.&#xD;
"Come in," said a clear voice; and, when&#xD;
the door opened, a rush of light came out on&#xD;
the dark corridor, disclosing a room like a sea-&#xD;
cave, all green and white, with long, swinging&#xD;
mirrors, and a dainty, spotless, canopied bed.&#xD;
Before one of these mirrors Ermine stood,&#xD;
putting the finishing touch to her toilet, in&#xD;
the shape of a lovely, half-blown rose, which&#xD;
nestled among its rich green leaves against the&#xD;
glossy plaits of her dark hair.&#xD;
"You have come for Lena, haven't you?"&#xD;
she said, turning round with a smile, as her&#xD;
cousin entered. "You ought to have been&#xD;
five minutes earlier-Margaret has just sent&#xD;
to ask for her, and, as I had finished dressing,&#xD;
I let her go."&#xD;
"Margaret is unconscionably selfish," said&#xD;
Madelon, in a pet. "Why cannot she be con-&#xD;
tent with her own maid? If I had a maid, I&#xD;
am surel should teach her to do herwork,&#xD;
and not have to beg the loan of somebody&#xD;
else's all the time. Au diabte I Don't look so&#xD;
shocked, my dear; it isn't half as bad as t~&#xD;
say, 'Go to the devil!' in English-and quite&#xD;
as gratifying to the feelings. I hope Lena&#xD;
will do her hair execrably-that would. be&#xD;
only poetical justice! But, meanwhile, who is&#xD;
to do mine?"&#xD;
"For the concert, do you mean?"&#xD;
"Yes, of course for the concert. Do you&#xD;
know, by-the-way, that Aunt Victorine has so&#xD;
far departed from her usual rule, that I am to&#xD;
be allowed to go with Major Hastings?"&#xD;
"Madden! Impossible!"&#xD;
"Afafoi, but it is possible! You can't be&#xD;
more surprised than I was-for five minutes.&#xD;
Major Hastings being a new acquaintance, of&#xD;
course did not know Aunt Victorine's inflexi-&#xD;
ble chaperon rule, so he asked me this after-&#xD;
noon if I would not allow him the honor of&#xD;
escorting me; and, more for amusement than&#xD;
any thing else, I referred the matter to Ma-&#xD;
dame ma tante, and she said-yes. For five&#xD;
minutes, as I remarked before, you could have&#xD;
knocked me down with a feather."&#xD;
"And then?"&#xD;
"Hum! 'Well, then I remembered one or&#xD;

&#xD;
two things, and my surprise abated-very&#xD;
quickly and very decidedly."&#xD;
"But what were the little things?" cried&#xD;
Ermine, impatiently. "Mamma, who is al-&#xD;
ways so very particular, so very Frenok in her&#xD;
ideas, who never lets us go with anybody but&#xD;
Raymond i-what is the meaning of it, Made-&#xD;
Ion?"&#xD;
"Set your wits to work and guess, my&#xD;
dear."&#xD;
"Is Major Hastings rich, and does she&#xD;
mean you to make a marine de convenanee,&#xD;
after the model of-well, no matter who?"&#xD;
"I have not the faintest idea whether he&#xD;
is next door to a beggar, or a millionaire;&#xD;
but ma taste is no vulgar match-maker. If he&#xD;
were a Roths4hild, she would not break her&#xD;
rules without better reason for it than that.&#xD;
Guess again, Ermine."&#xD;
"I-I can't. Tell me."&#xD;
"Will you do my hair for me, if I tell&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
"Yes," cried Ermine, with reckless im-&#xD;
patience. "Of course I will-only you must&#xD;
sit down at once, for it is getting late, and you&#xD;
know Raymond is always dreadfully impa-&#xD;
tient."&#xD;
"Let him learn to wait, then-somebody&#xD;
says that is Nature's noblest effort, and it is&#xD;
certainly the on~ that would do Raymond&#xD;
most good. Here I am, however-all ready,"&#xD;
She took off her hat, shook out her hair.-&#xD;
of which she had a magnificent suit, barring&#xD;
thatit was not remarkably silky in texture-&#xD;
and sat down in a low chair before the toilet-&#xD;
table and the large mirror which reflected the&#xD;
room with its hangings of pale sea-green, and&#xD;
made a picture of the two girls in all the win-&#xD;
ning grace of their youth and beauty.&#xD;
"Now," said Ermine, as she gathered up&#xD;
the heavy locks in both hands, and began&#xD;
with deft fingers to 'do the work of the maid&#xD;
who was just then arranging Miss Erleis&#xD;
golden tresses, while another maki stood by&#xD;
and looked admiringly on-"now you' are in&#xD;
my power-tell me at once, or I shall have no&#xD;
mercy on you."&#xD;
"You are horribly stupid to need to be&#xD;
told," said Madelon, with complimentary Can-&#xD;
dor. "Don't you see that, as usual, the Al.&#xD;
pha and Omega of the whole thing is Ray.&#xD;
mond?"&#xD;
"I am stupid, I suppose," said Ermine,&#xD;
humbly; "but I don't see it at all. What&#xD;
ha~ Raymond to do with Major Hastings?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Bah ii' It was the most significant&#xD;
interjection in the world. "Ermine, I am&#xD;
as~med of you I Listen, then-and be en-&#xD;
lig~itened. Don't you know that Margaret is&#xD;
to be sent to the concert with Mr. Sexton as a&#xD;
convenient mode of informing the world in&#xD;
general that the engagement is an accom-&#xD;
plished fact, and of bringing Margaret to&#xD;
terms through the medium of public opin-&#xD;
ion?"&#xD;
"Yes, I know."&#xD;
"Then, don't you see-Take care! you&#xD;
are braiding my hair unevenly. Perhaps I&#xD;
had better defer this interesting conversation&#xD;
until you have finished."&#xD;
"No, no-pray go on. I will be more&#xD;
carefuL"&#xD;
"Well, then, as I was remarking, don't&#xD;
you see that it is of course highly desirable&#xD;
that such a good opportunity should not be&#xD;
lost for throwing you and Raymond together?&#xD;
-Good Heavens! Ermine, don't pull my hair&#xD;
so dreadfully! My head is not made of India.&#xD;
-rubber or wood, and I really can't stand it."&#xD;
"I beg your pardon-I did not mean-&#xD;
Madden, if I thought you were right, I would&#xD;
not go to the concert for any consideration."&#xD;
"Nonsense 1" said Madden, who, seeing&#xD;
her cousin's excitement, began to be appre.&#xD;
hensive about the effect on her coi~?'ure.&#xD;
"Nonsense, Ermine - don't we always go&#xD;
with Raymond? Nobody is likely to think&#xD;
of you what they will be certain to think of&#xD;
Margaret and Mr. Sexton. It is simply that&#xD;
Aunt Victorine likes to 'give him an oppor-&#xD;
tunity to glide into the lover, which would b~&#xD;
rather difficult if I played the agreeable part&#xD;
of Mademoiselle Do Trop."&#xD;
"He would not dare," said Ermine, indig-&#xD;
nantly. "He knows that I know how long&#xD;
he has been in love with Margaret."&#xD;
"In love with Margaret!" repeated Made.&#xD;
lon, scornfully. "My dear, Raymond is in&#xD;
love with nobody but himself and his own in-&#xD;
terest. Aunt Victorine would not thank me&#xD;
for saying so, but it is a fact. Of course, we&#xD;
all know that Margaret is in love with kim;&#xD;
but I don't believe he has been any thing but&#xD;
tired of her this long while."&#xD;
"Madelon, you see so much you frighten&#xD;
me! How do you find -all this out?"&#xD;
"Simply by using the few wits which Na-&#xD;
tnt-c gave me to atone for her shabby conduct&#xD;
in other respects. Ermine "-the girl's light&#xD;
tone suddenly changed into so much of grave&#xD;
&#xD;
earnestness, that Ermine stopped short and&#xD;
stood in a tragic-muse attitude, armed and&#xD;
equipped with an ivory-backed brush-" why&#xD;
don't you make up your mind to marry Ray.&#xD;
mond? You will have to do it sooner or&#xD;
later, and why not at once?"&#xD;
"Madden, what do you mean?"&#xD;
"I think it is very evident what I mean,"&#xD;
said Madelon, pushing back the masses of&#xD;
hair which overhung her face, and looking up&#xD;
at her cousin in the mirror, with eyes like&#xD;
those of a sibyl. "Aunt Victorine and Mr.&#xD;
Erle have made up their minds that you are&#xD;
to marry Raymond- Raymond himself has&#xD;
made up his mind to the same thing; so I&#xD;
don't see that there is much for you to do but&#xD;
submit."&#xD;
"You know me no better than they do,&#xD;
Madden, if you think so."&#xD;
"I know you a great deal better, my&#xD;
dear," said Madelon, quietly, "and that is&#xD;
the only reason I have taken the trouble to&#xD;
speak to you. I know that you will make a&#xD;
death-fight, but I know, also, that in the end&#xD;
you will be obliged to succumb."&#xD;
"Why?"&#xD;
"Shall Itch you why?"&#xD;
"Yes, tell me-I should like to know&#xD;
what reason you could possibly have for such&#xD;
an&#xD;
"My reason is simply this: I am sure that&#xD;
the possession of your fortune is a matter of&#xD;
financial life and death to ,the Eries. It is&#xD;
their last card; and you can judge for your-&#xD;
self whether they are likely to allow your&#xD;
fancy to stand in the way of their playing&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"Do you mean that Mr. Erie is threatened&#xD;
with danger or embarrassment in his busi-&#xD;
ness?"&#xD;
"Hush! for Heaven's sake, speak lower!&#xD;
I mean that I would be willing to stake my&#xD;
existence that he is on thee brink of absolute&#xD;
failure. Don't ask mo how I know it. You&#xD;
could not understand if I were to tell you, for&#xD;
I have ways and means of information which&#xD;
would seem to you trifling and unimportant.&#xD;
Only be sure it is a fact. Ermine, you were&#xD;
an heiress 'when your father died: ever since&#xD;
then your fortune has been in the. hands of&#xD;
the best business man in Martinique, so you&#xD;
can imagine whether or not it is worth Mr.&#xD;
Erie's while to hazard a great deal for it&#xD;
now."&#xD;
"If I were of age I would give it to him,"&#xD;
&#xD;
said Ermine, passionately; "but I will never,&#xD;
never marry Raymond."&#xD;
"And yet, you absurd child, that is the&#xD;
only way in wldch you can give it to him.&#xD;
What would your husband, when you marry,&#xD;
say to your having quixotically bestowed your&#xD;
fortune on your step-father? What would&#xD;
the world say of Mr. Erie if he accepted it?&#xD;
Where is the hardship of marrying Raymond,&#xD;
after all?" the girl went on, with her cold,&#xD;
'trenchant cynicism. "Isn't he handsome ?-&#xD;
isn't he clever ?-isn't he sure to surround&#xD;
you with comfort a~d luxury all your life?&#xD;
M~rn Dien! Think of the men some women&#xD;
are obliged to marr~y-think of Mr. Sexton,&#xD;
for example!"&#xD;
"But why should I think of them? No-&#xD;
body can oblige me to marry Raymond."&#xD;
"Nobody can shut you up on bread-and.&#xD;
water, or use any romantic mode of compul-&#xD;
sion, I grant you; but other means are some-&#xD;
times quite as effective. Sooner or later, you&#xD;
will have to do it. Therefore, why not do it&#xD;
at once?"&#xD;
Ermine drew herself up haughtily. Just&#xD;
then she looked like a young pi-incess.&#xD;
"You seem to think I am a child, Made-&#xD;
ion, to be frightened by vague threats," she&#xD;
said. "I will not have to do it sooner or later.&#xD;
Nothing shall ever make me marry him. If&#xD;
mamma requested you to speak to me, you&#xD;
can tell her that."&#xD;
"Aunt Victorine has never mentioned&#xD;
the subject to me," answered Madelon. "I&#xD;
spoke of my own accord, because I was fool-&#xD;
ish enough to wish to do you a service. You&#xD;
have always been kind to me, and, if I have a&#xD;
soft spot in my heart for anybody-a fact, by-&#xD;
the-way, which I sometimes doubt-it is for&#xD;
you, Ermine. However, it is all very useless,&#xD;
I perceive; and my hair is being sadly neg.&#xD;
elected. It must be late. I stayed out longer&#xD;
than I meant to do, but the Battery was&#xD;
charming this afternoon. What were you&#xD;
doing with yourself?"&#xD;
"I was painting," said Ermine, with some.&#xD;
thing-a soft sort of mystical 'light-in her&#xD;
eyes. "Colors are like opium to me-I for.&#xD;
get every thing disagreeable or painful when I&#xD;
am with them. Sometimes I think I am color-&#xD;
mad. Every thing in the world-no matter&#xD;
how purely abstract-has a tint to me. I&#xD;
never hear a strain of music that it does not&#xD;
suggest a color or a shade of color. This&#xD;
afternoon I have been working at my sea:&#xD;

piece with such energy that it is almost fin-&#xD;
ished. Madelon, shall I show it to you?"&#xD;
"It is not much in my line," said Made-&#xD;
ion; "but still-if it will not inconvenience&#xD;
you-"&#xD;
"It is just here," said Ermine.&#xD;
She laid down the brush, which Madelon&#xD;
regretfully took up and began using, and&#xD;
~passed into a small room adjoining her cham-&#xD;
ber-originally a dressing.room, at present a&#xD;
studio. From this she reappeared, after a&#xD;
enoment, bearing a small canvas-in dimen-&#xD;
aiim not more than twenty-four by eighteen&#xD;
inches-which she held in her white, out.&#xD;
stretched arms before Madelon.&#xD;
The bright lamplight quivered softly on&#xD;
the clear, transparent tints-tints so exquisite&#xD;
that only an artist's soul could have felt them&#xD;
-and, turning, Madden took in at a glance&#xD;
the design of the picture. The sea-no shore,&#xD;
no rocks, no suggestion of distant land-but&#xD;
suck a sea that it was simply a marvel how a&#xD;
tyro's hand could have painted its divine, per-&#xD;
fect, eternal, yet ever-changing loveliness I A&#xD;
great, blue, waveless southern ocean, spread&#xD;
out in lustrous calm beneath a sky like a&#xD;
dream of heaven - stretching away, as it&#xD;
seemed, to iuflnite distance, and melting at&#xD;
the horizon into the translucent sapphire of&#xD;
the great vault of ether, until it was impossi-&#xD;
ble to tell where the water ended or the sky&#xD;
began. And in all the wide world of space,&#xD;
one object alone visible-a single, shattered&#xD;
spar, to which was lashed the slender figure of&#xD;
.a woman with white, motionless face, upturned&#xD;
toward that distant, serene heaven whence&#xD;
comet sometimes hope, and sometimes, again,&#xD;
despair. The sea had done its work. No&#xD;
gleam of life would ever again come to those&#xD;
sculptured features, nor would any living hands&#xD;
ever lay that fair form away, into the kind&#xD;
embrace of Mother Earth. What the&#xD;
possessed, the sea would keep, and the pla6id&#xD;
water seemed idly toying with the rounded&#xD;
limbs and floating hair, as if exulting in its&#xD;
power, and gilding, with a bright, treacherous&#xD;
smile, the destruction which it had worked.&#xD;
With all its faults--and faults, of course, were&#xD;
many-there was a fascination about the pict-&#xD;
ure which must have arrested any eye, and&#xD;
held, for a time at least, any attention spell-&#xD;
bound. A stranger could scarcely have be.&#xD;
lieved that this beautiful conception was from&#xD;
the hand of a girl of twenty, whose art-train-&#xD;
ing had been of that entirely amateur kind&#xD;
&#xD;
which is bestowed upon young ladies wh&amp;amp;&#xD;
have a weakness for spoiling canvas and wast-&#xD;
ing paint. There was none of that weak pret-&#xD;
tiness which usually damns even the best of&#xD;
such efforts; the very faults of the piece were&#xD;
faults of power, and there was a dramatic in-&#xD;
tensity about the whole scene which proved-&#xD;
more conclusively even than the wonderful&#xD;
coloring-the God-given power of the born&#xD;
artist.&#xD;
Such as it was, it startled even Madelon&#xD;
into forgetfulness of her yet undressed hair&#xD;
and probably waiting escort.&#xD;
"Ermine," she cried, "it is wonderful 1-it&#xD;
is beautiful! It is the best thing by far you&#xD;
ever did! I have no fancy for such work, you&#xD;
know, but, if it strikes me, it must be worth&#xD;
something!" Then, after a moment's pause,&#xD;
"Oh, why. did not God give me such a talent ?~&#xD;
It might have saved me, perhaps-it might&#xD;
have made something of me! But you-what&#xD;
need have you to labor like this?"&#xD;
"You might as well ask me what need I&#xD;
have to breathe," said Ermine, placing the&#xD;
canvas on a chair, and kneeling before it like&#xD;
a reverential worshipper at a shrine. "I love&#xD;
it 1-I love it! I ask for nothing, hope for&#xD;
nothing, desire nothing, when I am at my&#xD;
paints. 0 Madelon, I would give every thing&#xD;
in this world-except my guardian and Alan&#xD;
-to be an artist."&#xD;
"And can't you be one? You are rich&#xD;
enough to do any thing you please, I am&#xD;
sure."&#xD;
"But I want to give my life to it-to&#xD;
study, to work, not to be merely an eccentric&#xD;
young lady who dabbles in oils when she ha~&#xD;
no engagement to ride, or drive, or walk, or&#xD;
talk. I want to go to one of those delightful&#xD;
art-schools, to learn to paint as well as woman&#xD;
can learn, and then to live in Rome, in some&#xD;
pleasant studio with plenty of pictures, and&#xD;
only a crust of bread, perhaps-but I should&#xD;
eat it with such a light heart."&#xD;
"Vraimentl how easy it is to be romantic&#xD;
when one is rich!" said Madden, in a tone of&#xD;
overwhelming scorn.&#xD;
Yet it was a subject more fit for sadnesn&#xD;
than for ecorn-tha fair young creature, en-&#xD;
dowed with. all earth's brightest gifts, longing&#xD;
to shake them off and give heart and soul to&#xD;
the service of that divine Beauty which is&#xD;
known to us through Art. Ah me! is it not&#xD;
ever so? Was any existence ever so bright.&#xD;
that discontent had no place in it? Was any-&#xD;
&#xD;
human soul ever without these strange long-&#xD;
ings for another life than that which God has&#xD;
given? Was any heart ever so happy that it&#xD;
has not beat against its cage, yearning for bet-&#xD;
ter wings and wider flight? Was any glance&#xD;
ever so sunny' that it did not turn from the&#xD;
brightness around it, to gaze wistfully toward&#xD;
some distant spot of happier light? Even if&#xD;
such natures were, who could envy them? Is&#xD;
it' not better to dash hopelessly against the&#xD;
bars, than to sink down on the floor of some&#xD;
dreary prison and believe that its walls bound&#xD;
the world?&#xD;
"But my hair," said Madelon, coming back&#xD;
to present reality. "Are you, or are you not,&#xD;
going to finish it, Ermine?"&#xD;
"Of course I am," said Ermine, rising to&#xD;
her feet.&#xD;
But at this moment apleasant.faced, bright-&#xD;
eyed maid entered the room, whom Madelon&#xD;
greeted with enthusiasm.&#xD;
"Thanks to kind Fate, here comes Lena!"&#xD;
she said. "Now, perhaps, I may hope to go&#xD;
to the concert to-night. Ermine, pray don't&#xD;
let me detain you any longer.-lIas Margaret&#xD;
gone down, Lena?"&#xD;
"Just this minute, Miss Madelon?'&#xD;
"I suppose she looks as pretty as ever?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes'm, she looks very pretty, but"&#xD;
(a slight, insignificant hesitation here) "she&#xD;
was mighty hard to suit to-night. I'd have&#xD;
been here before, Miss Madelon, but for that."&#xD;
"Hum!" said Madelon, grimly, "I can&#xD;
imagine it. Being an angel to one's lover and&#xD;
an angel to one's maid are quite different&#xD;
things. Come, though, Lena, and make up&#xD;
for lost time now."&#xD;
The maid fell skilfully to work on the rich&#xD;
masses of hair, and-after tenderly conveying&#xD;
her painting back to its easel-Ermine left the&#xD;
room. As she descended the staircase, a&#xD;
latch-key rattled in the front-door, and, as her&#xD;
foot was on the last step, a gentleman entered&#xD;
the hall, whom she met under the chandelier,&#xD;
and with whom she exchanged a greeting.&#xD;
"Why, good-evening, papa! I thought I&#xD;
was late, but it seems I must be early, since&#xD;
you have just come in."&#xD;
"Good-evening, petite," said "papa," with&#xD;
a smile. "Yen are right in your thoughts.&#xD;
It is late-that is, late for me. What are yen&#xD;
looking so radiant about? Another party to-&#xD;
night?"&#xD;
"Oh, no-the concert Is it possible you&#xD;
have forgotten the concert?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Indeed, I an~ sorry to say it is possible,"&#xD;
answered he, with a smile.&#xD;
When he smiled, Mr. Erie positively did&#xD;
not look more than twenty-five; and, whether&#xD;
ile smiled, or whether his face was as grave as&#xD;
it could occasionally appear, he was in either&#xD;
ease a remarkably handsome man-a man&#xD;
whose good looks were of that delicate blond&#xD;
order which preserves the appearance of youth&#xD;
longer than any other. As he stood for a mo-&#xD;
ment, speaking to his step-daughter, with the&#xD;
light of the chandelier streaming over his&#xD;
chiselled features, his clear cornplexioh, his&#xD;
rich, fair curls, and violet eyes, he looked as&#xD;
if he might have riyalled the lovely Margaret&#xD;
herself, if Nature had only given him the right&#xD;
to wear soft green silk and delicate point-&#xD;
lace. It was only on scanning the face more&#xD;
closely that you saw a few insignificant lines&#xD;
about the eyes and mouth, which told the&#xD;
story of years and of passions. The man had&#xD;
"lived" every day of his life-with all his&#xD;
beautifulpelit maitre appearance, you were sure&#xD;
of that as soon as you marked the face more&#xD;
closely, and, although Nature or habit had pro-&#xD;
vided him with a very convenient and very be-&#xD;
coming waxen mask, which he wore on most oc-&#xD;
casions, the inner and more passionate self&#xD;
sometimes broke through and left its traces&#xD;
behind it.&#xD;
"I suppose Raymond is here?" Mr. Erle&#xD;
went on. "He left the office very early this af-&#xD;
ternoon, and I have not heard of him since. I&#xD;
should not have been so late, if his absence&#xD;
had not thrown several important letters on&#xD;
my hands. I wonder if he will have the grace&#xD;
to blush at sight of me?"&#xD;
"If so, you will have to teach him how,?'&#xD;
said Ermine, smiling. "I am sure he has not&#xD;
been guilty of such an indiscretion since he&#xD;
was five years old."&#xD;
"He shall answer for himself," said Mr.&#xD;
ErIe, drawing her hand under his arm.&#xD;
Mr. Erie was a model of a step-father, every.&#xD;
body said; so nobody was surprised when he&#xD;
and Ermine entered the Bitting-room inthis con-&#xD;
fidential fashion. The light evening meal was&#xD;
served on a small round table, among lights and&#xD;
flowers, at which Mrs. Erie and Mr. Sexton alone&#xD;
were sitting. ~The latter had evidently just ar-&#xD;
rived, and while he drank acup of scalding cof-&#xD;
fee (which had the becoming effect of throwing&#xD;
him into a profuse perspiration), having de-&#xD;
dined the iced tea which Mrs. Erie herself&#xD;
was sipping, he watched alternately his lemon-&#xD;

&#xD;
colored gloves-on which some drops of the&#xD;
dark beverage had already fallen-and his&#xD;
lady-love, who sat by one of the open windows&#xD;
overlooking the garden.&#xD;
As a matter of personal comfort, Miss ErIe&#xD;
would have preferred her usual downy nest&#xD;
among the cushions of the couch, but, whatever&#xD;
her shortcomings in other respects, she always&#xD;
knew better than to allow her dress and sur-&#xD;
roundings to "swear at each other," as the&#xD;
French expressively have it. An instinct-&#xD;
the artistic instinct which seems born in some&#xD;
women to whom art itself is a dead letter-&#xD;
always served to guide her right; and, being&#xD;
"cast" for Sabrina to-night, in sea-green silk,&#xD;
and misty lace, and coral ornaments, she kept&#xD;
very clear indeed of the blue background of&#xD;
the couch. Leaning over the back of her&#xD;
chair, and half concealed in the shade of the&#xD;
curtains, was a young man who raised his face&#xD;
as Ermine entered, disclosing the features of&#xD;
the Raymond of whom we have already heard&#xD;
so much, and of whom, fortune favoring, we&#xD;
shall hereafter hear still more.&#xD;
Like every other member of the family,&#xD;
Mr. Raymond Erle was handsome. People&#xD;
often marvelled over the chance which had&#xD;
brought so many remarkably good-looking&#xD;
people together in this household. "We have&#xD;
not a single plain face among us," Madelon often&#xD;
said, exultingly; and it was quite true. Once&#xD;
gathered together, the entire Erle clan and the&#xD;
pretty creole cousins, they formed a rare gal.&#xD;
axy of masculine and feminine beauty, com-&#xD;
prising several widely dissimilar types. Ray.&#xD;
mond, for example, was, in appearance, a law&#xD;
unto himself: that is, he did not resemble any&#xD;
other known ErIe, least of all his uncle. It is&#xD;
tolerably hard to photograph him in the few&#xD;
words which arc all that custom allows to a&#xD;
"description," and yet the attempt must be&#xD;
made; for, to leave his appearance merely to&#xD;
conjecture, would be to do that appearance a&#xD;
grievous injustice. The "medium height" is&#xD;
such a very indefinite phrase, and varies so&#xD;
much according to the physical standard of&#xD;
different localities (a tall man on the seaboard,&#xD;
for instance, being quite a pigmy among stal-&#xD;
wart moum~taineers), that it may be well to&#xD;
state positively that he was in height just five&#xD;
feet nine and a quarter inches. His weight&#xD;
was not so certain, but it could not have been&#xD;
very considerable,' for' his figure was slender&#xD;
even to fragility-thougb not without certain&#xD;
signs of muscular strength which a practiced&#xD;
&#xD;
Ii&#xD;
&#xD;
I~i&#xD;
[$1&#xD;
&#xD;
:id&#xD;
&#xD;
eye would have recognized at once. There&#xD;
was an elegance about this figure, a je ne asia&#xD;
quoi of well-bred style, which rendered Mr.&#xD;
Raymond ErIe a marked man in any assem-&#xD;
blage, and his picturesque face certainly did&#xD;
him good service in whatever society the ca-&#xD;
price of Fortune saw fit to cast him. A singu-&#xD;
larly handsome face it was-with an olive-pale&#xD;
complexion, faultless features, raven hair,&#xD;
heavy mustache, eyebrows pencilled like a&#xD;
Circassian's, and large, dark eyes, full of vel-&#xD;
vety softness which no one could mistake for&#xD;
gentleness-yet, withal, not in the least a face&#xD;
which could be styled effeminate. On the&#xD;
contrary, men felt instinctively that its owner&#xD;
was not to be trifled with; that this keen, fear-&#xD;
less, determined face indicated a nature ready&#xD;
to meet any emergencies, and not likely to re-&#xD;
gard any obstacles to a desired end. Not&#xD;
always, nor altogether, a pleasant face; but a&#xD;
face with an attraction which it was impos-&#xD;
sible to deny, and sometimes very hard to&#xD;
resist.&#xD;
The two cousins made such a lover-like&#xD;
tableau, ensconced in the shade of the window-&#xD;
curtains, with the fragrant night, all glittering&#xD;
stars and silent flowers, beyond, that Mr. Sax-&#xD;
ton's wandering, jealous glances were scarcely&#xD;
remarkable; yetRaymond's face, when he raised&#xD;
it, wore any thing but a lover-like expression.&#xD;
It would be hard indeed to imagine a more&#xD;
angry countenance. The dark-red flush which&#xD;
suffused the usually pale complexion, the knit-&#xD;
ted brows, and compressed lips, were all such&#xD;
unmistakable signs of deep and bitter vexation&#xD;
that even Ermine, usually well'acquainted with&#xD;
the amenities of the household, wassurprised.&#xD;
At sight of her, however, the lowering features&#xD;
quickly smoothed themselves, and a smiling&#xD;
cavalier came forward.&#xD;
"Don't you think we had better be in&#xD;
haste, Ermine?" he asked, after they had&#xD;
bidden each other good-evening. "It is never&#xD;
good style to be late at a concert; and then I&#xD;
know you would not like to miss the overture&#xD;
to the 'Midsummer-Night's Dream,' which is&#xD;
first on the programme."&#xD;
"Mayn't I cat a wafer and take some tea&#xD;
first?" asked Ermine, looking up at him with&#xD;
eyes in which there was something of the&#xD;
gleaming yet transparent lustre that water&#xD;
shows under a starlit sky. "Surely there is&#xD;
time enough for that?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes) time enough for that; indeed, I&#xD;
will bear you company as far as regards the&#xD;
&#xD;
tea. It is a wonderful stimulant, and may&#xD;
serve to keep me awake."&#xD;
"Awake, when you are going to hear the&#xD;
best orchestra and the finest cantatrice in the&#xD;
country!" said Ermine, with the marvelling&#xD;
scorn which he had meant to provoke.&#xD;
They sat down, however, in very compan-&#xD;
ionable fashion to their iced tea, and wafers&#xD;
so light that a puff of wind would have blown&#xD;
them off the table. Mr. Sexton, seeing his&#xD;
opportunity, finished his cup of coffee at a&#xD;
draught, made a half-muttered apology to his&#xD;
hostess, rose in a steam, and betook himself&#xD;
and his lemon-colored gloves over to where his&#xD;
"goddess of the silver lake" was sitting.&#xD;
"Bnh, what a porpoise l" said Raymond,&#xD;
in a low voice, watching him with disdainful&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
"At least he is not a 'laggard in love,'"&#xD;
said Ermine, smiling. "Sec how eagerly he&#xD;
goes, though Margaret does not look particu-&#xD;
larly gracious by any means."&#xD;
"Who can blame her?" asked Mr. Ray.&#xD;
mond, magnificently; in fancy, he could not&#xD;
avoid contrasting his own appearance with&#xD;
that of the rival to whom he had surrendered&#xD;
the fair field of his cousin's flfl'ections. "I~&#xD;
certainly requires all his wealth to gild the&#xD;
fellow's mere appearance. By Jove! he looks&#xD;
almost as rough as a sea-captain!"&#xD;
Ominous comparison! Whether innocent&#xD;
or not, who can say? At all events, at the&#xD;
mere sound of those two words, Ermine's ever-&#xD;
ready color flashed into her face, and she&#xD;
turned upon the speaker with startling impet-&#xD;
uosity.&#xD;
"I should think you would grow tired of&#xD;
that sort of sneers, Raymond," she said; "es-&#xD;
pecially when you know that there are many&#xD;
sea-captains who are as polished gentlemen&#xD;
as-as you are t"&#xD;
"Many, my dear Ermine, or only one?"&#xD;
asked Raymond, with a smile which nobody&#xD;
could possibly have fancied genial.&#xD;
"There may be many, for aught I know;&#xD;
that there is one, I do know," she answered,&#xD;
quickly.&#xD;
"Granting even that, does one swallow&#xD;
make a summer? or, because a gentleman&#xD;
housess to lower himself to the rank of a cer-&#xD;
tain class of people, does he thereby lift his&#xD;
new associates to the grade which he has for-&#xD;
feited?"&#xD;
"Raymond," said the girl, quickly, "I&#xD;
don't want to hear any more! You never&#xD;
&#xD;
lose any opportunity to scoff at Alan and&#xD;
Alan's profession, and there is no good in an-&#xD;
swering you. Only," with sarcasm almost as&#xD;
trenchant as Madelon's, "I should like to&#xD;
know why it is any more lowering to a gentle-&#xD;
man to trade on sea than to trade on land?"&#xD;
"Ermine, you forget yourself," said her&#xD;
mother, sternly.&#xD;
"Oh, let lapet its talk!" said Mr. ErIe, indul.&#xD;
gently. "Words hurt nobody except poor&#xD;
Raymond, who must look after himself; and the&#xD;
heiress of half the island of Martinique can&#xD;
afford to regard with scorn a mere commiSsion-&#xD;
merchant."&#xD;
Poor Ermine! Almost any one might&#xD;
have felt sorry for Aer just then, that burning&#xD;
flush dyed her white cheek so hotly and pain-&#xD;
fully once more.&#xD;
"I-I did not mean that," she said, quickly.&#xD;
"Papa, I beg your pardon. I did not intend&#xD;
any thing disrespectful to your tra-that is,&#xD;
profession. Only Raymond might let Alan&#xD;
alone!"&#xD;
"To the best of my knowledge, I have not&#xD;
mentioned Alan from first to last," said Ray.&#xD;
mond, in the most injured tone imaginable.&#xD;
"This is a sample of the way you always treat&#xD;
me, Ermine. I cannot make the most inci-&#xD;
dental or general remark, but you accuse me&#xD;
of a particular intention to sneer. I am heart-&#xD;
ily ashamed of Alan and Alan's profession,"'&#xD;
said the young man, with energy "but he?&#xD;
chose it with his eyes open, ar~d that is an end~&#xD;
of the matter."&#xD;
"I only wish it was an end of the matter,"'&#xD;
said Mr. ErIe, in a resigned tone. "But unfor...&#xD;
tunately Ermine's friendship is of such an en~&#xD;
thusiastic nature that Alan and Alan's affairs&#xD;
seem to me to furnish the staple seasoning of&#xD;
our life."&#xD;
"There is certainly no need to inform the&#xD;
world that one of our near connections com-&#xD;
mands a trading-vessel," said Mrs. Brie, in her&#xD;
dignified voice, "yet I heard Ermine, tell Gen-&#xD;
eral Borne the other day that her 'cousin' was&#xD;
not in the navy, but in the merchant ~ervice."&#xD;
"I did not say so, mamma, because the mein-~&#xD;
chant service is more creditable than the navy,&#xD;
but because it is a fact."&#xD;
"It is not always necessary to proclainz&#xD;
facts," said Mr. Erle. "That idea, my dear&#xD;
Ermine, is your greatest error."&#xD;
"I hope it will remain my errora long time,&#xD;
then," said Ermine ungratefully. "And as for&#xD;
Alan, the rest of you may be ashamed of him~&#xD;

&#xD;
if you like, but I am proud of him-prouder&#xD;
than I ever was of anybody else in my life."&#xD;
"You can afford to indulge those fine&#xD;
sentiments, since he is no relation of yours,&#xD;
and does not disgrace you in the least," said&#xD;
Raymond, shying scraps of wafer at a pet-dog&#xD;
belonging to one of the children, who caught&#xD;
them eagerly, and found them exceedingly. un-&#xD;
satisfactory morsels.&#xD;
"As far as that is concerned, you know I&#xD;
consider him my cousin as much as Margaret&#xD;
does."&#xD;
"By brevet appointment, I presume-yet&#xD;
I cannot claim a kinsman's most distant privi-&#xD;
lege without incurring rebuke.'1&#xD;
"My dear boy, there are Erles and Erles,"&#xD;
said his uncle, smiling benignly. "You are a&#xD;
commission-merchant, and Alan is a sea-cap-&#xD;
tain-the distinction makes the difference."&#xD;
"I am inclined to think there is another&#xD;
distinction which makes another difference,"&#xD;
said Raymond, meaningly-then he leaned back&#xD;
in his chair and watched Ermine, with a glance&#xD;
which she felt though she did not see, as Mr.&#xD;
Erie left the table and walked across the&#xD;
room, followed by his wife. "There is an-&#xD;
other distinction-is there not, Ermine?" he&#xD;
asked after a while in a quick, low voice, in-&#xD;
audible at five paces off.&#xD;
"Yes," answered the girl, glancing up at&#xD;
him with fearless candor. "There is another&#xD;
distinction-and you know what it is, Ray-&#xD;
inond."&#xD;
"What is it, Ermine?"&#xD;
"It is that Alan is open and true as the&#xD;
day," she answered, in the same tone "It is&#xD;
that there is no more narrowness in his heart,&#xD;
than there is pettiness in his soul; that he&#xD;
could no more shackle himself with the bond-&#xD;
age of worldly opinion than he could stoop to&#xD;
a mean action; and that God gave him so gem.&#xD;
erous a spirit, so fine a nature, that, if he were&#xD;
a hod-carrier, he would still be a gentleman."&#xD;
The young man looked intently into her&#xD;
glowing face.&#xD;
"Well," he said, dryly, "now for the com-&#xD;
panion-sketch-the reverse-picture.1'&#xD;
"You have heard that often enough, Ray-&#xD;
inond."&#xD;
"Yes," he said, with a faint, bitter laugh,&#xD;
"I have certainly heard often enough-perhaps&#xD;
a little too often-all the bad qualities with&#xD;
which you are pleased to endow me. I should&#xD;
be worse than Isgo if I possessed half of them,&#xD;
Ermine."&#xD;
&#xD;
I can only hope that you don't possess&#xD;
any of them, then, Raymond."&#xD;
"Do you never mean to do me any jus-&#xD;
tice? "he asked, with a certain subdued vehe-&#xD;
mence of manner.&#xD;
She looked up at him with a quick flash in&#xD;
her eye.&#xD;
"Set me an example, by doing Alan jus-&#xD;
tice," she said, curtly.&#xD;
The dialoguehas reached rather an exciting&#xD;
point. Both their faces are flushed, and their&#xD;
eyes glowing, as Madelon enters the room and&#xD;
takes in the situation at a glance. As she&#xD;
crosses the 'floor, Raymond bends down and&#xD;
says hurriedly, but in a concentrated sort of&#xD;
voice:&#xD;
"By Heaven, Ermine, instead of teaching&#xD;
me to do Alan justice, you are teaching me to&#xD;
hate him as fast as one man can learn to hate&#xD;
another!"&#xD;
Then before Ermine-startled and angry-&#xD;
can reply, he has risen and walked away.&#xD;
"May I have a cup of coffee?" said Made-&#xD;
lon, coming to the table. "There goes that&#xD;
horrid door-bell-Major Hastings, of course&#xD;
-Ermine, how does my hair look? You are&#xD;
lovely, my dear-and what a color! You&#xD;
ought to get Raymond to talk to you whenever&#xD;
you are going out. He leaves such a charm-&#xD;
ing bloom behind him."&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
UNDER THE STASSLIGHT.&#xD;
THE orchestra is pealing away at the fairy&#xD;
sclwrzo of the overture to the "Midsummer-&#xD;
Night's Drei~m"-thatpulse ofjoy which seems&#xD;
beating for all time-when Ermine and her&#xD;
escort file softly down the carpeted aisle of a&#xD;
crowded house, and are ushered to their seats&#xD;
among a decorously silent and well-bred au-&#xD;
dience. The color has not yet left the girl's&#xD;
face-only it has ebbed from the lily-white&#xD;
cheeks to concentrate, as it were, in the vivid&#xD;
carnation of the lips, and brighten the soft,&#xD;
full-orbed lustre of the eyes-so that she never&#xD;
looked more lovely than she does just now,&#xD;
seeming, to the fancy of more than one among&#xD;
those who level glance or opera-glass upon&#xD;
her, like some fair, delicate, passion-hued trop-&#xD;
ical flower.&#xD;
"That girl's eyes always remind me of&#xD;
lotos-eating and floating down the Nile," said&#xD;
&#xD;
one poetically-inclined gentleman in a low&#xD;
aside to his companion. "I suppose she and&#xD;
ErIcare engaged; but I can't say I approve of&#xD;
the match. They are entirely too ~nuch alike.&#xD;
You've read 'Counterparts,' haven't you?&#xD;
People of the same temperament should never&#xD;
matry."&#xD;
"Yes, I have read 'Counterparts,'" an-&#xD;
swered the companion, who chanced to be an&#xD;
unusually bright and clever girl; "but I don't&#xD;
agree with you in thinking that Mr. Erie and&#xD;
Miss St. Amand are of the same temperament.&#xD;
One cannot go by the simple fact that they&#xD;
both have dark eyes, you know. I will wager&#xD;
you any thing you please, that, if you ask some-&#xD;
body who understands such things, he or she&#xD;
will tell you that, if not eountel~parts, they are&#xD;
at least totally unlike."&#xD;
"But how am I to find the somebody?&#xD;
Who does understand such things?'~&#xD;
"Indeed, I don't know. Temperament is&#xD;
a dead letter to most people, undoubtedly-but&#xD;
hush! You must not talk while this heavenly&#xD;
music is going on!"&#xD;
It is heavenly indeed; and Ermine is rapt&#xD;
in a trance better by far than the lotos-eat-&#xD;
ing of which her admirer has spoken-better&#xD;
than any thing else in the world save that di-&#xD;
vine beatitude coming from the pure love of&#xD;
the saints for God, of which this is no place to&#xD;
speak. Music-and of all music that which&#xD;
comes lik'~ a breath of fragrant incense from&#xD;
Mendelssohn's heart-has led her into a palace&#xD;
of calm delights where none can follow to mo-&#xD;
lest her. The exquisite rise and fall of elfin&#xD;
melody, the very sound with which the bow&#xD;
first kisses the silver strings of the violin,&#xD;
stirs and soothes her at once. Other critical&#xD;
ears are there which listen and admire, as who&#xD;
could fail to admire that harmony which dies&#xD;
away "like the sweet south wind over a bed&#xD;
of violets," that perfect mechanism; that su-&#xD;
perb orchestration, which Mendelssohn alone&#xD;
perfected as an art; but, although they enjoy&#xD;
with intense appreciation, they are not borne&#xD;
away on the overflowing tide as Ermine is.&#xD;
She leans back quite silent, quite motionless,&#xD;
only her expanding eyes-which momently&#xD;
grow larger, fuller, and more lustrous-tell the&#xD;
story of her perfect beatitude. Who can say&#xD;
what dreams the music wakes, what visions&#xD;
which only a painter could conceive, or a poet&#xD;
describe, float through her brain on the golden&#xD;
tide of melody? Into the fragile girl-form&#xD;
God had seen fit to infuse the true artist-soul&#xD;
&#xD;
-that soul which can enjoy more keenly, suf-&#xD;
fer more exquisitely, aud live more wholly&#xD;
alone than any other which He, in His bound-&#xD;
less, fathomless wisdom has ever created.&#xD;
Form, color, sound, each and all have a differ-&#xD;
ent meaning to her from what they have to&#xD;
the mass of mankind. She feels them, as she&#xD;
feels joy and sorrow, in superlative degree.&#xD;
Those who follow the short record of her short&#xD;
life will do well to bear this in mind-well to&#xD;
remember that to such natures do not apply&#xD;
the cast-iron rul~s which govern the world at&#xD;
large. Wholly, sometimes fatally different&#xD;
from all others, are they, and, seeing with sad&#xD;
eyes how cruelly th~ir tender flesh is sometimes&#xD;
bruised by the sharp thorns of earth, we can&#xD;
only hope that compensation is given them by&#xD;
that serene Heaven whence pity as well as&#xD;
mercy ofttimes "droppeth like the gentle&#xD;
rain.&#xD;
After the orchestral overture, the house&#xD;
broke into a tumult of that kid-glove applause&#xD;
which is so significant of what the newspapers&#xD;
call "a select and fashionable audience "-&#xD;
applause not meant for those soft, dying ca-&#xD;
dences, like fairy "horns of Elfland.blowing,"&#xD;
but for the graceful, girlish figure, the piquant&#xD;
girlish face which came before the foot-lights,&#xD;
the young singer-now world-renowned, then&#xD;
in the first flush of her youth-whom they had&#xD;
assembled to honor. When she began to sing&#xD;
-ah, well! the ravishing notes of that sweet&#xD;
voice dwell yet in the heart~ of some who&#xD;
heard her in those long-vanished golden days,&#xD;
and it may be that the fascination of the past&#xD;
hangs over them. At all events, it boots little&#xD;
to repeat the verdict which the world has long&#xD;
since passed on the fair cantatrice, or praise&#xD;
the power which wrought her audience out&#xD;
of dreaming, critical calm, into a fever of en-&#xD;
thusiasm on that by-gone night. Perhaps,&#xD;
for all their high-b red languor, the warm&#xD;
Southern current of their blood was ready&#xD;
enough to be stirred. Even unimpressible&#xD;
Raymond, who had yawned behind his hand&#xD;
at the overture, beat one palm upon another,&#xD;
as he said, "She is divine!"&#xD;
"Yes, she is divine!" echoed Ermine in&#xD;
such a tone that iie turned and looked curi-&#xD;
ously at her.&#xD;
"One would think that you had been tak-&#xD;
ing opium," he said. "I never saw the pupils&#xD;
of your eyes dilated as they are now! You&#xD;
look as if you were dreaming dreams, or see-&#xD;
ing visions. Is it hashish or excitement?"&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
"The soul of the music has gone into my&#xD;
blood, as ~fennyson says of the rose," answered&#xD;
she, smilh~g. "You are too cold-you don't&#xD;
know anj thing about it. No wonder Mira.&#xD;
beau wanted to die to the sound of music. It&#xD;
would surely take the pang out of dying-if&#xD;
any thing could!"&#xD;
"I thought painting was your hobby," said&#xD;
he, gisheing over the programme, to sce how'&#xD;
much longer it would be before the concert&#xD;
ended.&#xD;
"And isn't it all the same thing? Ohif&#xD;
you could only tell what pictures I have seen&#xD;
-what exquisite, lucid, beautiful tints-since&#xD;
I have been sitting here. But then it is not&#xD;
heaven. It must end."&#xD;
"Soon too, I hope," said he, devoutly.&#xD;
But nonc of this concerns us very much,&#xD;
save in its effect on Ermine-which effect&#xD;
could scarcely be overrated. She might have&#xD;
been taking opium, hashish, any thing, from&#xD;
the expression of her face, the rapture of her&#xD;
sensations, when at last she rose to go. At&#xD;
another time she would not have felt the music&#xD;
so intensely; but the excitement of the even-&#xD;
ing had eome too closely-too entirely without&#xD;
intermission-on the excitement of the day,&#xD;
on the long, feverish strain over the picture&#xD;
that had mastered her soul as the music mas-&#xD;
tered her mind. Now she was "deified," she&#xD;
trod in supreme exaltation on air; yet a wise&#xD;
physician looking at her would have foreboded&#xD;
terrible things from the reaction so pitilessly&#xD;
sure to come. Do you remember the wonder.&#xD;
ful description of an opiusn.tranee which Dc&#xD;
Quincey gives in the "Suspiria?" Something&#xD;
like this was upon Ermine when, pouring out&#xD;
with the crowd, she found herself driving&#xD;
home, under a dome of deepest steel.blue,&#xD;
thickset with glittering stars. Sleep! How&#xD;
should she sleep with every pulse throbbing,&#xD;
every nerve quivering, every faculty of being&#xD;
strung to its utmost tension? Surging through&#xD;
her brain-dominating even the jubilant clash&#xD;
of the orchestra, and the pure tones of a silvery&#xD;
voice-she seemed to feel the mighty pulse of&#xD;
the sea, to hear the soft swish of the waves, to&#xD;
catch the liquid sound of that grand ocean.&#xD;
monotone which, old as Time itself, will only&#xD;
end when "Time shall beno more."&#xD;
"Raymond," she said, as they alighted be.&#xD;
fore the door of the Erle House, from the&#xD;
open windows of which laughter and merry&#xD;
voices floated out on the odorous night air,&#xD;
"I cannot go in and face all those people-the&#xD;
&#xD;
noise and the light and the talk would drive&#xD;
me distracted. I am going down to the Bat.&#xD;
tery to listen to the water. It may quiet&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"Quiet you!" said Raymond, naturally&#xD;
much astonished. "My dear Ermine, what&#xD;
quiet do you need? You have not spoken&#xD;
three words since the concert ended."&#xD;
"Au, but you don't know what I have&#xD;
felt! How could you? I should not be sur.&#xD;
praised if you were sleepy; but I am confident&#xD;
I shall never sleep again."&#xD;
"The best remedy for that will be to go to&#xD;
bed, I think."&#xD;
"Go to bed! The mere idea of such a&#xD;
thing is abhorrent to me! I should simply&#xD;
lie and. toss and toss and toss-until finally in&#xD;
despair I might go to my paints. Then&#xD;
wouldn't I look a ghost tomorrow! If you&#xD;
want to avert that calamity, you wrn not say a&#xD;
word while I run down to the Battery."&#xD;
"You forget your mother-what will siw&#xD;
say?"&#xD;
"If I were Madelon, I should answer, au&#xD;
disable with mamma! As it is, I don't care&#xD;
what she says. I must go-I will go ! Won't&#xD;
you be a good boy, and stay here till I come&#xD;
back? I pledge you my word, I sha'n't be&#xD;
gone ten minutes l"&#xD;
"Stay here! I should think not, indeed!&#xD;
I will be a better boy, however, and go with&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"Oh, no, no-I must go by myself. I want&#xD;
the silence, and the night, and the water.&#xD;
Raymond-please stay!"&#xD;
"Don't be a-don't be foolish, Ermine!"&#xD;
said Raymond, almost roughly. "If you have&#xD;
a mind for romantic star-gazing, of course I&#xD;
will take you to the Battery; but a.s for letting&#xD;
you go alone-that is nonsense! Your mother&#xD;
placed you under my care, and, whether you&#xD;
want me or not, I shall accompany you."&#xD;
"Then," said Ermine, with a slight stamp&#xD;
of her foot on the pavement, "I won't go!"&#xD;
"Then," said Raymond, with a very per-&#xD;
ceptible accent of anger, "you will be doing a&#xD;
much more sensible thing than I could have&#xD;
expected of you."&#xD;
"You are impertinent!" cried she, blazing&#xD;
out upon him.&#xD;
"Pardon me," said he, biting his lips. "I&#xD;
had forgotten that women think they have a&#xD;
monopoly of incivility."&#xD;
"Raymond, you know that is not true!"&#xD;
"Whatever it is," said Raymond, coldly,&#xD;
&#xD;
"I think this discussion had better be con-&#xD;
cluded in the house."&#xD;
"I am not going into the house," retorted&#xD;
Ermine, haughtily. "I am going down to the&#xD;
Battery."&#xD;
"Then I shall accompany you."&#xD;
"You may follow nie, if you choose-you&#xD;
certainly shall not accompany me."&#xD;
A pause. Affairs being at a " dead-lock,"&#xD;
both combatants stop for breath, and eye each&#xD;
other in wrathful silence. Just then a hand&#xD;
pushes back a curtain of the bay-window, and&#xD;
two figures-a man's and a woman's-stand&#xD;
relieved against the brilliant light behind.&#xD;
The woman is tall, slender, white-clad, with&#xD;
heavy dark plaits binding her head, and a&#xD;
scarlet flower burning among them: the man&#xD;
is aJso tall, well made, and handsome. Their&#xD;
voices float out distinctly on the still night&#xD;
air.&#xD;
Says the gentleman, "Your Benedict and&#xD;
Beatrice have not arrived yet."&#xD;
"No doubt they have stopped en route for&#xD;
a sociable quarrel," answered Madelon's silver,&#xD;
mocking voice. "Benedict and Beatrice have&#xD;
a weakness that way, you know."&#xD;
"They certainly are an interesting pair of&#xD;
lovers," says the deeper tones, languidly.&#xD;
"But can you tell me-why is quarreling al.&#xD;
ways an incipient sign of love?"&#xD;
"How should I ,know? I never quarrel,&#xD;
and I never was in love."&#xD;
"You never quarrel !-you never were in&#xD;
love! My dear Mademoiselle Lautrec, how&#xD;
shocking! If some one made you very angry,&#xD;
then, you might, perhaps, condescend to begin&#xD;
the first-and, having begun the first, you&#xD;
might glide into the second."&#xD;
"Scarcely, I think."&#xD;
"May I try?"&#xD;
"To make me angry? Oh, certainly; but&#xD;
I think it right to give you warning that you&#xD;
will not be likely to repeat the offence."&#xD;
"Why not?"&#xD;
"Simply because I regard it as such a fool-&#xD;
ish and undignified amusement that I always&#xD;
drop the acquaintance of any one who has once&#xD;
led me into it."&#xD;
"Thanks for the warning-I shall be care.&#xD;
ful, then. But why make such a rule ?-why&#xD;
leave such a charming character as that of&#xD;
Beatrice entirely to your cousin?"&#xD;
"Probably because I have no fancy for a&#xD;
Benedict."&#xD;
"Would a Romeo suit you better?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"To smother me in sweets? No. 'Aueun~&#xD;
citemin defleurs ne conduit cl la gloii'e '-and r&#xD;
take it that Jove and glory are much the same:&#xD;
thine~"&#xD;
"Perhaps Mark Antoriy-"&#xD;
"Ah, now you touch me more nearly-only,.&#xD;
instead of losing a world for me, I should&#xD;
much prefer that he would gain one."&#xD;
"With you for inspiration, who could fail&#xD;
to do so?"&#xD;
"INow, that is very pretty, Major Hastings.&#xD;
I am sure you have nothing better in your&#xD;
quiver; so, on the principle of the best thing;&#xD;
last, we will go back and report to Aunt Vie.&#xD;
torine that Ermine ~ias not come."&#xD;
The curtainn fell again as they passed away.&#xD;
For a moment there was silence between the&#xD;
two eavesdroppers outside; then, in a hard sort&#xD;
of a voice, Ermine said:&#xD;
"If you have no objection, I believe Is1~ould'&#xD;
prefer for you to come with me. I have some-&#xD;
thing to say to you."&#xD;
"I am at your service," he answered,.&#xD;
stiffly.&#xD;
Side by side they walked a~way. Raymond&#xD;
did not offer his arm-probably because h&amp;amp;&#xD;
knew that it would not be accepted-and&#xD;
neither of them spoke until they reached the&#xD;
Battery. Then, for the first time, Mr. ErIe&#xD;
opened his lips.&#xD;
"Give me your hand, Ermine-you wlll&#xD;
miss the step."&#xD;
"No, thanks-I can see p~rfectly,",replied&#xD;
Ermine, coldly. Having ascended the steps,.&#xD;
she turned from him, arid, walking some die.&#xD;
tatice, stood leaning against the railing-a&#xD;
white shape, faintly outlined in the dusky&#xD;
gloom-gazing seaward, and listening to the&#xD;
waves beating softly at her feet.&#xD;
What her thoughts were, Heaven only&#xD;
knows-perhaps she did not know herself-&#xD;
but the quiet of Nature stole over her like a.&#xD;
subtle spell. Excited fancy, indIgnant~ anger,.&#xD;
both died down; both seemed hushed into.&#xD;
insignificance by the wonderful power that&#xD;
wrapped water and shore in their "trance~&#xD;
calm" of perfect rest. In a little while she&#xD;
might have been herself once more-the self&#xD;
that shrank morbidly from giving pain-.-if&#xD;
Raymond had only been wise enough to leave&#xD;
her alone.&#xD;
But Raymond was no observer of that&#xD;
subtle flux and reflux of feeling, which-chief~&#xD;
ly for the want of a better name-we call&#xD;
mood. Eminently practical himself the sensi-.&#xD;

&#xD;
tive, artistic temperament was to him m~e&#xD;
than a marvel, worse than an enigma: it was&#xD;
sheer folly and imposition. As he stood silent,&#xD;
striving to read the riddle of that white, stead-&#xD;
fast face, he registered a solemn vow that if&#xD;
this wayward, haughty girl were ever in his&#xD;
power, her romantic fancies should be very&#xD;
summarily dealt with, and her proud spirit be&#xD;
broken if it would not bend. At present, his&#xD;
predominant feeling with regard to her was&#xD;
one of intense irritation; and unfortunately he&#xD;
was not entirely successful in keeping this sen-&#xD;
timent out of his voice, when he finally lost&#xD;
patience and spoke.&#xD;
"Did you bring me lucre to gaze at you,&#xD;
while you gazed at the stars, Ermine? If&#xD;
there were a little more light, I might find the&#xD;
rcile interesting; but at present it is rather un-&#xD;
satisfactory."&#xD;
Ermine started, and, frowning slightly under&#xD;
cover of the darkness, turned toward him.&#xD;
No one could have told how keenly this dis-&#xD;
'cordant voice jarred on her at the moment.&#xD;
"No," she said, with more repellant cold.&#xD;
ness than he had ever seen in her before, "I&#xD;
did not bring you ~uere to gaze at me. That&#xD;
would have been a very poor inducement in-&#xD;
deed. I brought you to speak a few plain&#xD;
words-for I think it is tim~ that we came to&#xD;
an explanation."&#xD;
"Indeed!" said Raymond, a little startled,&#xD;
yet not ill pleased, that his opportunity had&#xD;
eome thus unexpectedly. "I am a plain&#xD;
man," he went on, "and therefore always&#xD;
ready for plain speaking. Let us have an&#xD;
explanation by all means ; the sooner the&#xD;
better."&#xD;
"Yes," said Ermine, " the sooner the&#xD;
better." Then she stopped a moment to collect&#xD;
herself, for in truth it was a bold step she was&#xD;
about to take, and one from which she would&#xD;
have shrunk if this tide of excitement had not&#xD;
been giving her a fietitiou~ strength. "Since&#xD;
you are fond of plain speaking, Raymond,"&#xD;
she continued, before he l~ad time to do more&#xD;
than feel the pause, "I hope you will not be&#xD;
surprised if I speak to you very plainly-so&#xD;
plainly that I may perhaps shock you. You&#xD;
heard what Madelon and ~ajor Hastings were&#xD;
saying. Of course, it is n  ~t necessary ' for me&#xD;
to tell you that such things are not true.&#xD;
Since they are not true-since they never will&#xD;
be true-you can imagine how very disagree.&#xD;
able they are to me. In fu~ct, I will not toler-&#xD;
ate them. Being a man, you must find some&#xD;
&#xD;
way to let people understand that you and I&#xD;
are nothing to each other."&#xD;
"Being a man, my dearQErmine, that is&#xD;
just what I cannQt do," said Raymond, fold-&#xD;
ing his arms and leaning against the railing so&#xD;
as to face her.&#xD;
"Why not?" she asked, haughtily.&#xD;
"Simply because it is not my place to do&#xD;
so; and simply also because we are a great&#xD;
deal to each other now, and I hope we may be&#xD;
more hereafter."&#xD;
"You forget yourself;" she said, growing&#xD;
in 1~auteur every moment. "You are nothing&#xD;
to me either now or hereafter; and certainly&#xD;
I will never be any thing to you!"&#xD;
In the clear starlight they could see the&#xD;
outline of each other's face, but all play of&#xD;
expression was of course veiled in obscurity. If&#xD;
Ermine had been able to watch the effect of&#xD;
her last words, she would have seen that Ray-&#xD;
mond paled in very marked degree, though his&#xD;
tone was as easy as it had been before, when&#xD;
he answered:&#xD;
"I can prove that you are mistaken, Er-&#xD;
mine., The man who loves you passionately,&#xD;
and wishes to devote his life to proving that&#xD;
love, cannot possibly be 'nothing' to you;&#xD;
while you are simply every thing to me."&#xD;
"Raymond 1" She was so young that for&#xD;
a moment she lost dignity in passion. "How&#xD;
dare you utter such words to me! You know&#xD;
they are not true. You know that, if you ever&#xD;
loved anybody besides yourself, you loved&#xD;
Margaret, an'd that she-poor girl-loves you&#xD;
still!"&#xD;
"Margaret!" he repeated, and his face&#xD;
lightened, for he thought that, if she were&#xD;
jealous, his~hance was better than even he had&#xD;
dared to hope. "Is it possible you think me&#xD;
such a fool as to love Margaret, Ermine?&#xD;
You might know me better. You might&#xD;
know that the beauty of a doll is not likely&#xD;
to attract me; and Margaret has little besides&#xD;
that."&#xD;
"I am very well aware that she has not a&#xD;
fortune," said Ermine, bitterly.&#xD;
The shaft was too keen not to strike home;&#xD;
for, let a man be ever so conscious of mer-&#xD;
cenary motives, a taunt concerning those mo-&#xD;
tives is none the less hard to bear. The dark-~&#xD;
red flush common to Raymond's olive com-&#xD;
plexion surged over it, as he an~wcred, rais-&#xD;
ing his figure a little, and slightly throwing&#xD;
back the chest across which his arms were&#xD;
folded:&#xD;
&#xD;
"I see you think that woman may use in-&#xD;
sult as well as incivility with impunity, Ermine.&#xD;
However, it is well for us to know exactly on&#xD;
what ground we stand. Do you mean to&#xD;
imply that my object in addressing yourself is&#xD;
purely mercenary?"&#xD;
The question was pointed and direct. Er.&#xD;
mine's clear tones answered it without a shade&#xD;
of wavering or hesitation:&#xD;
"Knowing no other object which you could&#xD;
possibly have, I am constrained to say that I&#xD;
do."&#xD;
"Then," said he, haughtily, "justification&#xD;
is impossible to me, and, if it were ever so pos.&#xD;
sible, would be beneath me. In this, as in&#xD;
many other things, I must bear as best I can&#xD;
the odium of your injustice."&#xD;
"I am tired of that charge," said she, pas-&#xD;
sionately. "Prove tome that I am unjust, and&#xD;
there is no one living who will sooner amend a&#xD;
wrong. You know that of me. Prove to me&#xD;
that I misjudge you; do not content yourself&#xD;
with mere assertion."&#xD;
He bent forward and laid his hand down&#xD;
upon hers. Even in the starlight she seemed&#xD;
to fehi the fire whieh gathered in the velvety&#xD;
depths of those dark eyes.&#xD;
"If I prove your injustice to you, Ermine,&#xD;
will you let me name my own reward?"&#xD;
She shrank back from him-shrank in-&#xD;
voluntarily, and in a manner which would&#xD;
have cut to the very heart a man who truly&#xD;
loved her.&#xD;
"No" she said, "I can make no such&#xD;
promise, because, if I were ever so much mis-&#xD;
taken, I can only beg your pardon for my un-&#xD;
just suspicions."&#xD;
"Will you give me leave to convince you&#xD;
of the sincerity of my love, Ermine?"&#xD;
"No, Raymond." She spoke more gently&#xD;
now, because in truth it was hard to behave&#xD;
that the earnestness quivering in his voice was&#xD;
all for her fortune. "It would be useless. I&#xD;
can never love you."&#xD;
"Many women have said that who learned&#xD;
the lesson of love at last."&#xD;
"1'crhaps so-but I am not one of those&#xD;
women."&#xD;
"Give me at least leave to try. You shall&#xD;
be free as air-bound to nothing. Only let&#xD;
me try."&#xD;
"No," said she, quickly-almost sharply.&#xD;
"That would be next thing to an engage-&#xD;
meat, and people would have some right to&#xD;
talk of us, while you would have some right&#xD;
&#xD;
28&#xD;
&#xD;
to reproach me when I came to say, at last,&#xD;
what I say now-I do not love you, and I can&#xD;
never marry you."&#xD;
"You had better consider that decision,&#xD;
Ermine."&#xD;
"If I considered it forever, I should never&#xD;
change it," said she, relapsing into haughti-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
"You are sure of that?"&#xD;
"I am perfectly sure of it."&#xD;
He shrugged his shoulders slightly, and&#xD;
again she seemed to feel the light of the dark&#xD;
eyes facing her own so steadily in the soft&#xD;
starlight.&#xD;
* "I am not a betl~ing-man, Ermine," he said,&#xD;
quietly, "or I should be willing to layheavy&#xD;
odds that you will live t~ regret those words.&#xD;
-and to unsay them."&#xD;
Why was it that at this moment a cold&#xD;
hand seemed to grasp Ermine's heart, and&#xD;
hold it in a vice? She was free as air; no&#xD;
human being had any power of compulsion&#xD;
over her-least of all, the man who stood be-&#xD;
side her-yet Madelon's words seemed to come&#xD;
back on the soft flow of the water murmuring&#xD;
at her feet: "Sooner or later, you will have&#xD;
to do it-why not succumb at once?"&#xD;
But the serrsment du eceur, as the French&#xD;
call this contraction, did not last more than a&#xD;
second. Indignation rushed over her all the&#xD;
more strongly for the momentary terror which&#xD;
had preceded it; and her words, when she&#xD;
spoke, seemed to sting like a whip, in their&#xD;
contemptuous scorn.&#xD;
"It is time for this conversation to end,.&#xD;
since you think it worth your while to try to&#xD;
intimidate me. I think I have said all that I&#xD;
wished to say-that I have definitely made&#xD;
clear all that I desired to make clear. I&#xD;
brought you here to tell you, once for all, that&#xD;
the plans which you have been building will&#xD;
never be realized; and, having told you this,&#xD;
my conscience is clear."&#xD;
"In other words," said Raymond, whose&#xD;
anger was so great that he could not restrain~&#xD;
the expression of it, "you did me the honor&#xD;
to reject me before I had ever made a pro-&#xD;
posal."&#xD;
"I knew you would not spare me that.&#xD;
taunt," said Ermine, quietly. "I expected it,&#xD;
and it does not wound me in the least. Of its.&#xD;
generosity I leave you to decide. Once more,&#xD;
however, I must request that it may be defi-&#xD;
nitely understood by everybody concerned,&#xD;
that there is no truth in the rumors whicin&#xD;

"Perhaps I can enlighten you on that&#xD;

"I do not care to be enlightened," she re-&#xD;
turned. "The subject has no interest for me.&#xD;
Now, if you please, we will go back. Madden&#xD;
and Major Hastings may make some other&#xD;
pleasant and good-natured remarks on our ab-&#xD;

"One moment," said he, laying his hand&#xD;
again on hers. "You have had your turn to&#xD;
.speak-now I must be sufficiently discourteous&#xD;
to detain you until I have had mine. In the&#xD;
first place, I do not accept your decision as&#xD;
final. No-yo(n need not start and draw yOur-&#xD;
self up. That should be made clear at once.&#xD;
I do not accept it. I shall endeavor to induce&#xD;
you to reconsider it, and I tidnic zou will do&#xD;
so. Next "-was it Ermine's fancy that the&#xD;
voice took a alight tone of menace here ?-" I&#xD;
wish you to understand that I know perfectly&#xD;
well who has been at work to prejudice you&#xD;
against me, and that I generally pay my debts&#xD;
-with interest."&#xD;
"Raymond," the girl gasped-for the first&#xD;
time unnerved and thrown off her guard-c--" I&#xD;
do not understand you. I do not know who&#xD;
you mean. No one has ever spoken againstt&#xD;
you to me. On the contrary, everybody-&#xD;
there at home-is only too anxious for me to&#xD;
marry you. I..-.-I do not know whom you&#xD;
mean."&#xD;
"You know perfectly well whom I mean,"&#xD;
he answered. "You know pexfcctly well that&#xD;
I mean that-.-that brother of mine, Whose&#xD;
business in life has been to annoy and disgrace&#xD;
rue. The day may come, perhaps, when he&#xD;
and I will settle scores, and then I shall not&#xD;
be likely to forget to-night."&#xD;
"Alan is capable of taking care of him-&#xD;
self," said Ermine, in that voice of indescrib-&#xD;
ably mingled pride and tenderness which is&#xD;
so significant from a woman's lips. "Your&#xD;
threats do not frighten mo-they only prove&#xD;
how right I have been from first to last in my&#xD;
opinion of you. As for his having ever influ-&#xD;
enced me against you, I will not defend him&#xD;
from such a charge. Even while you make it,&#xD;
you do not believe it yourself."&#xD;
"In ether words, you accuse inc of delib-&#xD;
erate falsehood. (lo on, Ermine I Fill up the&#xD;
full measure of your injustice!"&#xD;
* "Raymond, I am tired," she cried, with a&#xD;
sudden sound like a moan of paint '~Oh,&#xD;
why have you forced me to all this ?-why&#xD;
&#xD;
will you not be content when I tell you that I&#xD;
do not love you? I can say.no more than&#xD;
that.1'&#xD;
"There is no effect without a cause," said&#xD;
he, grimly. "You do not love me because,&#xD;
with all your haughty pride, you do love some&#xD;
one else-and I know only too well who that&#xD;
some one ~&#xD;
He uttered the last words with ill-con-&#xD;
cealed malice, and paused for an answer, but&#xD;
no answer came. Ermine turned from him,&#xD;
and took two or three steps away. Then in&#xD;
the starlight he saw her pause, and apparently&#xD;
kneel down against the railing. He waited a&#xD;
minute or two, but she remained so silent and&#xD;
so still that he went up to her, and, after his&#xD;
questions received no reply, laid his hand on&#xD;
the white shoulder that gleamed like polished&#xD;
marble through her muslin dress~#~~&#xD;
Then he saw thai the reaction had come,&#xD;

head pillowed on the railing, while the starlit&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
ERLES AND ERLES.&#xD;
PEXIHAPS there is nothing more trying to&#xD;
the patience of a story-teller, than to be forced&#xD;
to pause in full tido of dramatic action to fur-&#xD;
nish some tiresome bit of explanation, descrip-&#xD;
tion, or retrospection, which, ten to one, will&#xD;
bore the reader almost, if not quite, as much&#xD;
as it has already bored the writer, yet which&#xD;
the exigenciesof the narrative render impera-&#xD;
tively necessary. At such times one yearns&#xD;
for the liberty of a playwright, who leaves his&#xD;
characters to tell their own stories, and de-&#xD;
scribe their own antecedents in that epigram-&#xD;
matic flow of language with which everybody&#xD;
is gifted on the stage-wasting neither time&#xD;
nor paper on the excessively " heavy~' business&#xD;
of filling in and filling out, of narrating family&#xD;
circumstances, and recounting family genealo-&#xD;
gies, which falls with such a responding&#xD;
weight of weariness on the unfortunate novel-&#xD;
ist. What must be, must be, however; and&#xD;
sometimes matters come to such a pass that&#xD;
a few plain words are absolutely essential to&#xD;
set them straight, to place the reader in that&#xD;
properly confidential position which a reader&#xD;
should always fill, and-as they expressively&#xD;
have it at sea-to "clear the decks for ac.&#xD;
&#xD;
tion"in such a satisfactory manner that there&#xD;
shall hereafter be no troublesome interrup-&#xD;
tions to the smooth working of those different&#xD;
threads which go to form the story. Thus&#xD;
much by way of preface and apology for a&#xD;
few words which duty-not inclination-ne-&#xD;
cessitates, concerning the Erles. Somebody&#xD;
says that the writer who goes back in his&#xD;
story for any purpose whatever, loses ground&#xD;
and goes back just that much in the estima-&#xD;
tion of his reader. If this rule hold good, I&#xD;
fear that I must prepare myself for an enor-&#xD;
mous retrograde movement in the minds of all&#xD;
who may glance through the pages of this&#xD;
sketch, for the necessity of which I have al-&#xD;
ready spoken requires a backward leap of&#xD;
several years from the date on which my story&#xD;
opens.&#xD;
To begin in rather irregular fashion, there&#xD;
once lived an English governess in the house-&#xD;
hold of the Erles, a certain Miss North, who,&#xD;
being of a decided literary turn, and of de-&#xD;
cided scribbling propensities, kept a journal in&#xD;
which were recorded many things, curious and&#xD;
otherwise, concerning the family in which she&#xD;
resided. It occurs to me just now that I&#xD;
can lighten my own shoulders of a consider-&#xD;
able burden by throwing the labor of describ-&#xD;
ing the past circumstances of the Erles on&#xD;
the willing shoulders of Miss North. Her&#xD;
journal-which I chance to possess-is tempt.&#xD;
ingly explicit on this point, and, as far as I&#xD;
can judge, moderately attractive in style, so I&#xD;
cut therefrom a few pages, paste them in my&#xD;
MS., and head them in approved romantic&#xD;
fashion.&#xD;

"To-day being Friday, I did not begin&#xD;
school, but I saw my two pupils, who are kept&#xD;
much more to their~ own domain of nursery&#xD;
and school-room than American children in&#xD;
general, tested their acquirements, settled the&#xD;
order of their studies, and gave them some&#xD;
lessons for Monday. They are very bright&#xD;
children, perfectly polished in manner, and&#xD;
quite well instructed in all the biensiances of&#xD;
social life, but as ignorant as little pigs of&#xD;
the most common rudiments of every-day&#xD;
learning. Reginald could not spell his own&#xD;
name, when I told him to do so, but shrugged&#xD;
his shoulders with the air of a Chesterfield as&#xD;
he said, 'Fit bien, he would write his initials&#xD;
&#xD;
as Cousin Raymond did!' I strove to ex-&#xD;
plain that, in case of emergency, it would be&#xD;
as well to know how to write it in full, and I&#xD;
think he at lastacimitted the force of my rea-&#xD;
soning. I have taken quite a fancy to him,&#xD;
although he frankly informed mc that he&#xD;
hated governesses, and wanted to go to school&#xD;
with other boys. 'Suppose other boys asked&#xD;
you to spell your name?' I said. And at&#xD;
that my young gentleman hung his head. As&#xD;
for Louise, she is a little fair-haired doll, a&#xD;
pocket edition of Margaret, with her head so&#xD;
full of toilets and ciuffons that I despair of&#xD;
ever putting much else into it. She smoothed&#xD;
out her pink-silk skirt, in which she looks&#xD;
like a little ballet-dancer, and sat on my lap&#xD;
with her tiny-slippered feet crossed, her small&#xD;
hands demurely laid over one another, her&#xD;
large blue eyes on my face, and answered all&#xD;
my questions with an aplomb and ease of man-&#xD;
ncr that would have done credit to a young&#xD;
lady of two seasons. She told mc exactly&#xD;
what sort of ' point it is that ' mamma&#xD;
wears on her handkerchiefs, how many beau-&#xD;
tiful bracelets and rings Margaret has in her&#xD;
box on her toilet-table, and oh! what a lovely&#xD;
gold-colored silk came home for Ermine the&#xD;
other day, with* flounces just so (showing ~on&#xD;
her own diminutive skirt), and trimming across&#xD;
the body this way. But I shall nevcr forget&#xD;
her face when I asked her the result of add-&#xD;
ing two and two together.&#xD;
"After I had disposed of the children, I&#xD;
sent for Ermine, who came, with a glow of&#xD;
pleasure that made her look fairly beautiful,&#xD;
and conducted me to her chamber.&#xD;
"'Mamma orders that all painting be done&#xD;
in the school-room,' she said, 'but I draw&#xD;
here as much as I please, and I want you to&#xD;
look over my portfolio. My teachers used to&#xD;
compliment me a good deal on these sketches,&#xD;
but I hope you will not hesitate to express&#xD;
your real opinion about them.'&#xD;
"I assured her that I would certainly ex-&#xD;
press my real opinion, whatever that opinion&#xD;
might be; and, with her mind apparently&#xD;
much relieved on this point, she placed me in&#xD;
a delightful easy-chair by an open window,&#xD;
whose lace curtains the soft southern breeze&#xD;
was fluttering to and fro, drew a low otto-&#xD;
man forward for herself; and laid a richly-em-&#xD;
bossed drawing-portfolio in my lap.&#xD;
"To say that I was astonished, when I un-&#xD;
tied the strings and began to. look over the&#xD;
different sketches, is a very faint way of ex-&#xD;

ERLES AND ERLES.&#xD;
&#xD;
pressing what I really felt. I am forty-five&#xD;
years old, and I have been tossed about the&#xD;
world ever since the day I entered a pen~i on-&#xD;
nat des demcieelles at Paris; I have visited&#xD;
numberless schools of design, and seen the&#xD;
sketches of hands with whose works the world&#xD;
is now familiar; I have frequented exhibitions&#xD;
all my life, and taken the greatest interest in&#xD;
artists and their productions; but I had never&#xD;
seen any thing to equal the exquisite delicacy&#xD;
of finish and power of touch which were visi-&#xD;
ble in these sketches of a girl barely seventeen,&#xD;
and almost entirely untaught. As I turned&#xD;
them over, I remembered the day when I, too,~&#xD;
had hoped to do something with colors; Ire-&#xD;
membered the bitter death of that hope, and,&#xD;
for the first time in all my life, I felt resigned.&#xD;
My rough counsellors had been right. Talent~&#xD;
was mine, never genius like this. One after&#xD;
another I placed aside the sheets of 'bristol-&#xD;
board, and still wonder grew upon me; for,&#xD;
whether it was an elaborate drawing where&#xD;
stroke was laid on stroke with the beauty of&#xD;
a line-engraving, or the merest outline unfilled&#xD;
by any detail, the same facile pencil showed&#xD;
itself, the same bold freedom of hand was&#xD;
there, fhe same marvellous power of conveying&#xD;
expression in a single line or dot, the same&#xD;
divine inspiration caught from Nature's self.&#xD;
"I looked entirely through the portfolio&#xD;
before I said any thing; then, as I began to&#xD;
replace the sketches, I saw that Ermine was&#xD;
gazing very wistfully into my face.&#xD;
"' I see what you think,' she said, in a&#xD;
very subdued voice. 'Don't pain yourself by&#xD;
telling me, mademoiselle. You think I have&#xD;
been flattered and am very foolish-that is&#xD;
all.'&#xD;
"I looked down at her; the soft, dark&#xD;
eyes met mine very bravely, though a little&#xD;
sadly, and, after a while, I laid my hand on&#xD;
her shoulder.&#xD;
"'Child,' I said, gravely,' I wish it were&#xD;
some voice of more authority than mine to tell&#xD;
you that God has given you one of His great&#xD;
talents, and that in this portfolio is that which,&#xD;
if you choose, can make you world-renowned.'&#xD;
"She started violently, and looked at me&#xD;
incredulously.        -&#xD;
"'Mademoiselle, you-you are jesting!'&#xD;
"I shook my head.&#xD;
"'No, I am in earnest-do you think I&#xD;
would jest on such a subject ?-as much in&#xD;
earnest as when I tell you that all question of&#xD;
teaching is at an end between us. We can&#xD;
&#xD;
paint together, and I may be able to give you&#xD;
a few practical hints ii~ the use of colors; but&#xD;
instruction I am unable to render.'&#xD;
"She looked at me half startled, almost&#xD;
awed.&#xD;
"'Mademoiselle, pardon me ; lean scarcely&#xD;
believe any thing so strange! I~ this really&#xD;
true?'&#xD;
"I answered as gravely:&#xD;
"'It is certainly true.'&#xD;
"Then, to my surprise, she bowed her&#xD;
head down on heir hands, and I saw quick&#xD;
tears gush through the slender fingers.&#xD;
"'Alan was right,' she said, in a low&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
"After this we adjourned to the school-&#xD;
room, to see what she could do with colors,&#xD;
and here I found that my instruction was very&#xD;
much needed. She knew verylittle indeed of&#xD;
painting, and even what she did know had&#xD;
evidently been taught by incompetent masters.&#xD;
Her aptitude and eagerness to learn, however,&#xD;
I had never seen surpassed. She threw her-&#xD;
self, hcart and soul, into the lesson, hung upon&#xD;
my every word, watched my manipulations of&#xD;
the brush with eyes that fairly glowed, and at&#xD;
last dashed off a bit of foreground that elicited&#xD;
my warmest praise.&#xD;
Is it really good?' she asked, still some-&#xD;
what suspiciously.&#xD;
It is really wofiderful, for a beginner.&#xD;
What a pity you are an heiress, my dear!&#xD;
You ought to be what Nature has made you,&#xD;
an artist.'&#xD;
"'Oh, how I should like it!' she cried,&#xD;
eagerly. 'I would rather be an art-student,&#xD;
and work for my daily bread, than the rh~hest&#xD;
heiress in the world.~'&#xD;
"'Does it never strike you that a good&#xD;
many art-students would gladly exchange their&#xD;
lives for yours?'&#xD;
"'Sometimes,' she answered, retreating a&#xD;
step back to look at a rock she was painting&#xD;
-' sometimes, and then I wish we could man-&#xD;
age to do so. It would make me very happy,&#xD;
I am sure.&#xD;
"'And would you give up your beautiful&#xD;
island?'&#xD;
"'I would go to see it. I could enjoy it&#xD;
as much as if I owned the whole of it, you&#xD;
know.'&#xD;
A' 'And your guardian?~&#xD;
"Her face fell; it was almost as mobile&#xD;
and candid as a child's, that face!&#xD;
&#xD;
"'True. I would have to give up all my&#xD;
friends to the new Ermine. Then I don't&#xD;
think I could possibly exchange with her. I&#xD;
would not resign my dear guardian and Alan&#xD;
for all the paints in the world!'&#xD;
"What a strange girl she was! Her dear&#xD;
guardian and Alan-not a mention of her&#xD;
mother or any member of the household in&#xD;
which she lived?&#xD;
"'Yes,' I said, laying an artful little trap,&#xD;
'the new Ermine would take all your friends&#xD;
as well as your fortune~-she would be your&#xD;
mother's daughter, and yea Would have no&#xD;
more interest in her than a stranger.'&#xD;
"She was standing with her profile to me,&#xD;
and I thought I saw her lip quiver at the last&#xD;
word; but, if so, it was only for a second, ~nd&#xD;
she answered, after a moment, quite as easily&#xD;
as before:&#xD;
"'I hope she would be fair, then, and like&#xD;
dresses and visiting, and-Raymond! Mamma&#xD;
would gain by the exchange, in that case.&#xD;
Poor mamma 1'&#xD;
"There was a sudden change of tone-a&#xD;
sudden giving way-a sudden pathos in the&#xD;
last two words, that took me completely by&#xD;
surprise. I looked up quickly; the girl's face&#xD;
was quivering all over as if with unshed tears,&#xD;
and she suddenly threw down her palette and&#xD;
brushes.&#xD;
"'That is enough for this morning, don't&#xD;
you think so, mademoiselle? It is nearly din-&#xD;
ner-time, and I must change my dress, for&#xD;
look what paint-stains are all over it!'&#xD;
"'You must have some aprons,' said I,&#xD;
looking at the pretty muslin which was ruined.&#xD;
'Don't forget 1-long aprons that will cover&#xD;
the whole front of your dress. I will not&#xD;
give you another lesson until you have put&#xD;
one on.'&#xD;
"'Very well,' she answered, a little ab-&#xD;
sently. 'I will tell Lena to make me some at&#xD;
once. What are you going to do, mademoi-&#xD;
selle?'&#xD;
"'I am going to clean this palette of&#xD;
yours,' I answered, a little severely. 'Jt&#xD;
should never be left in this condition.'&#xD;
"At which Mademoiselle St. Amand very&#xD;
forcibly took the palette out of my hand.&#xD;
"'Let it alone,' she said. 'I mean to send&#xD;
Lena to do it.'&#xD;
"'Lena! But how should a maid know--'&#xD;
"'She knows,' interrupted my companion,&#xD;
decisively. 'Alan showed her how when he&#xD;
and I used to play at painting,~and were both&#xD;
.3&#xD;
&#xD;
of us too lazy to clean the palettes and brushes&#xD;
ourselves.'&#xD;
"'But my dear Ermine, do you never do&#xD;
any thing for yourself?'&#xD;
"The young West-Indian shrugged her&#xD;
graceful southern shoulders.&#xD;
"'A gui bon, mademoiselle? If I were&#xD;
poor and an artist, I should have to, you know&#xD;
-but I am not either poor or an artist, and&#xD;
that is an end of the matter 1-Come, I want&#xD;
to wash my hands, and then-do you know&#xD;
what I mean to do?'&#xD;
"'No. Howshouldl?'&#xD;
"She bent down, laughing, and made the&#xD;
portentous annomiceyient in a very dramatic&#xD;
whisper:&#xD;
"' I mean to show you Alan's sketches.'&#xD;
"' Indeed!' said I, not quite so over-&#xD;
whelmed as she seemed to expect. 'Then&#xD;
perhaps you will also enlighten my ignorance&#xD;
as to who Alan is. I have not heard yet, you&#xD;
know.'&#xD;
"'Have you not? Well, then, you shall&#xD;
hear-all about him! Come, now.'&#xD;
"She ran lightly down-stairs before me--&#xD;
the school-room is in the third story-singing&#xD;
a gay French song as she went, and seeming&#xD;
to fill the Whole house with the grace of her&#xD;
sunshiny presence. I could not help follow-&#xD;
ing her fondly with my eyes-it is such a&#xD;
pleasure to see a young girl who is still enough&#xD;
of a child to enjoy her youth. At the foot of&#xD;
the stairs she paused to wait for me, and we&#xD;
both went hack to the pretty chamber we had&#xD;
left an hour before-the chamber that looked&#xD;
~as pure and sweet as its occupant.&#xD;
"I sat down in my former seat by the&#xD;
open, jasmine-hung window, while Ermine&#xD;
washed her paint-smeared hands, and, that&#xD;
duty over, crossed the floor to a little inlaid&#xD;
cabinet, unlocked it with a key that hung at&#xD;
her ckdtelaine, and gazed down at it as she&#xD;
might have gazed at the tiny altar arranged&#xD;
with such care in a curtained recess not far off~&#xD;
-the altar with its ivory crucifix and holy-&#xD;
eyed Madonna, its withered palm-branch and&#xD;
flask of holy water, its silver lamp and all the&#xD;
other tender arrangements, which, strict Prot-&#xD;
estant though I was, had touched my heart&#xD;
strangely when I first entered the room.&#xD;
"'This is where I keep every thing coil-&#xD;
nected with Alan,' said she, glancing back at&#xD;
me. 'I love dearly to look at them-but&#xD;
still, they make me sad. I cannot exactly tell&#xD;
why, but they do. Here is a little boat he&#xD;

I should have been grievouslydisappointed- -most things are, in this world. So 1-is it&#xD;

extraordinary either in conception or execu- "'What is the matter?' she asked, for I&#xD;
tion. The ordinary efforts of clever talent, had suddenly paused, with my eyes fixed on&#xD;

&#xD;
hour I went on shipboard to the hour I&#xD;
landed, aud from the hour I landed to the&#xD;
hour I first saw Alan's faee. I had worn out&#xD;
everybody's sympathy, and worried every-&#xD;
body to death. I had even so far exasperated&#xD;
mamma that she forbade my appearing in her&#xD;
presence "until I could behave myself prop-&#xD;
erly." I was ns much an object of disgust to&#xD;
Margaret as she was an object of detestation&#xD;
to me. I hated Mr. Erle, I hated the city, the&#xD;
house, the servants, every thing abput me, I&#xD;
even fairly loathed the daylight; and I was&#xD;
lying on a trundle-bed in the nurseryy, sob-&#xD;
bing my very heart out, and wishing I could&#xD;
commit suicide-you need not smile, made-&#xD;
moiselle, for I remember distinctly that I-was&#xD;
wondering how I could manage to do it-&#xD;
when the door opened, and it seemed to me&#xD;
an angel stood there. But it was only Alan-&#xD;
dear old Alan, in whom there was not much&#xD;
of the angel! He had been writing in the&#xD;
school-room, and heard my sobs. To this day&#xD;
I remember the exprOssion of his face-its&#xD;
supreme pity and gentleness, though he was&#xD;
only a boy, and a very rough boy, of sixteen.&#xD;
To this day I hear his voice as he said, "Poor&#xD;
child ! "-and took me and all my misery up&#xD;
in his arms. From that hour I loved him,&#xD;
and from that hour I have been resigned to&#xD;
my life of exile. Mademoiselle, do you won.&#xD;
der at it?'&#xD;
"I smiled. It was so like an intense&#xD;
Southern nature to magnify such a simple act&#xD;
into such large proportions!&#xD;
"'At the loving, or the resignation -&#xD;
which, Ermine?'&#xD;
"'The loving,' said she, frankly. 'Ah!&#xD;
if you only knew how good and true and ten-&#xD;
der he has always been to me! And they try&#xD;
to make me ashamed of him! Ashan~ed of&#xD;
hint I My brave Alan! Why, I honor him&#xD;
more, as the simple captain of the Adventure,&#xD;
than if he were an admiral of a hundred&#xD;
navies!'&#xD;
"I contented myself with simply asking,&#xD;
Why?'&#xD;
"Then the impulsive tongue was loosed,&#xD;
and she told me a very touching story in a&#xD;
few words:&#xD;
"Fifteen years ago, by f~r the largest and&#xD;
wealthiest business-house in Charleston-one&#xD;
which dealt in all commercial enterprises with&#xD;
a bolder spirit and on a surer basis than any&#xD;
other-was that of Erle Brothers. They were,&#xD;
it seems, for a time, the veritable money-kings&#xD;
&#xD;
not only of Charleston itself; but of the whole&#xD;
rich country which was, in a trading sense,&#xD;
tributary to it. Their ships were on every&#xD;
sea, their endorsement was received as gold in&#xD;
every mart of commerce, their enterprise and&#xD;
prosperity were building up the city as well as&#xD;
their own fortunes, when there came a year to&#xD;
be long ren,~embered, of monetary panic and&#xD;
crash-n time when all credit failed, when&#xD;
gloom overspread the whole country, when&#xD;
disaster and ruin were so common that men&#xD;
merely shrugged their shoulders over a new&#xD;
failure. Yet, even at such a time as this, the&#xD;
tidings echoed like a thunder-bolt that the&#xD;
house ofErIe Brother~ was bankrupt! It was&#xD;
only the old story, with the old tragic ending&#xD;
-for the elder brother, unable to face his&#xD;
darkened life or shattered fortunes, put a pis.&#xD;
tol to his head and ended both! The younger&#xD;
acted more sensibly. Thanks to a very hand-&#xD;
some face and a very beguiling tongue, he&#xD;
married a charming and wealthy West - In-&#xD;
dian widow whom he met while temporarily&#xD;
rusticating in those lovely islands. Then,&#xD;
with his wife's. fortune, h"~ came back to&#xD;
Charleston, and resumed the old liusiness on a&#xD;
much smaller scale. The dead brOther's old-&#xD;
est son brought so much untiring energy and&#xD;
skill to the cause of reiistablishing the fallen&#xD;
credit of the house, that he was rewarded&#xD;
with the position of junior partner; and, from&#xD;
that day to the present, this second firm has -&#xD;
been steadily advancing in the public confi-&#xD;
denc~, until there are now few more influen-&#xD;
tial houses in the city. But, meanwhile, there&#xD;
was another son-this Alan-who, from his&#xD;
boyhood, had loved the sea as only sailors of&#xD;
Nature's own making ever do love it, who was&#xD;
his father's pride atid delight, and who, while&#xD;
Raymond was destined to the gloomy tread-mill&#xD;
of the counting-house, had always been pi~om-&#xD;
ised his heart's desire-a naval appointment.&#xD;
lie received it at last, and had already made&#xD;
his first cruise, as a midshipman, when the&#xD;
awful blow came. It was ~he first news to&#xD;
greet him when he reached his native shore-&#xD;
the first item that met his eye in the first news-&#xD;
paper carelessly thrust into his hand -the&#xD;
one topic upon every tongue. Even the very&#xD;
newsboys cried in his ear, 'Failure of Erle&#xD;
Brothers! Suicide of the senior partner!'&#xD;
It was good for the poor b4 that he had a&#xD;
mother-else the blue water was very close at&#xD;
hand, and youth is little able to bear those two&#xD;
spectres that daunt the oldest and the hardest&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC8067-00000018"/>&#xD;
"SEE, THE CONQUERING HERO COMES!"&#xD;
&#xD;
- Disgrace and Mortal Agony. He came&#xD;
home, however-to be congratulated that the&#xD;
crash left his prospects comparatively unhurt.&#xD;
His mother-the father's second ~vife-had&#xD;
been moderately independent, and, with a&#xD;
thoughtfulness very rare among American&#xD;
men, her husband had insisted that all her&#xD;
fortune should be settled on herself This&#xD;
was safe, this would support her in ease, and&#xD;
also give Alan an independence of the world;&#xD;
but the two only looked in each other's eyes,&#xD;
and saw the same desire in each. 'My son,&#xD;
it is for your father's good name 1'the mother&#xD;
said. 'Give it up, mother,' said the boy. 'I&#xD;
will work for you.' So, despite the angry re-&#xD;
monstrances of the elder brother, the fortune&#xD;
was resigned to the creditors of the firm, Mrs.&#xD;
ErIe opened a school, and Alan gave np his&#xD;
profession and ambition forever!&#xD;
"'For, you see, he could not continue in&#xD;
the navy,' said Ermine, who had warmed with&#xD;
her story until her eyes were glowing with&#xD;
enthusiasm. 'He had to make money-for&#xD;
he was determined his mother should not&#xD;
drudge at school- teaching longer than he&#xD;
could help-and the navy is the last place in&#xD;
the wodd for that, you know; so ~e entered&#xD;
the merchant - service. Nobody, except his&#xD;
mother, encouraged him in the step-every-&#xD;
body thought it was a dreadful thing for a&#xD;
gentleman's son to dojiRay~ond fairly raged&#xD;
against it-~bat Alan held firm. "I was born&#xD;
for a sailor," he said; j'I shall never be con-&#xD;
tent anywhere but o~ the sea, and I can be&#xD;
content there in an~r capacity. When Na.&#xD;
ture makes a man ohe thing, he never does&#xD;
any good by going against the grain and be-&#xD;
coming another. I shall not cease to be a&#xD;
gentleman because I enter an honest profes-&#xD;
sion, nor lose any regard that is worth keep-&#xD;
ing." And he carried otrt his purpose-his&#xD;
two purposes. He became a seaman, and he&#xD;
has risen so steadily that, although he is only&#xD;
twenty-six nOw, he is captain of one of the&#xD;
finest vessels that leaves the port of Charles-&#xD;
ton. He supports his mother so well that she&#xD;
gave up her school long ago, and lives in one&#xD;
of the most charming little houses in the&#xD;
world, where I will take you to seeher some&#xD;
day, for I love her dearly, and she looks just&#xD;
like a fairy godmother!'&#xD;
"Of course I said I should like it very&#xD;
much, but, staid governess as I am, I believe&#xD;
Ermine's enthusiasm has so far infected me&#xD;
that I feel more in~ined to see her wonderful&#xD;
&#xD;
hero-the naval officer turned sea.captain-&#xD;
than even the mother for whom he made his&#xD;
sacrifice."&#xD;
This is as much of Miss North's journal as&#xD;
concerns us at present. She has told-amply&#xD;
at least-the story of the Erles; and it is to&#xD;
be hoped that her conclusion may find some&#xD;
faint echo in the minds of all readers, gentle&#xD;
or otherwise; for the "naval-officer turned&#xD;
sea-captain," whom she desired to see (and&#xD;
whom, by-the-way, she did see, and liked ex-&#xD;
tremely), wrn soon make his bow before the'&#xD;
foot-lights.&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
SEE, THE CONQUERING HERO COMES1"&#xD;
"WELL, my dear, how do you feel this&#xD;
morning?" asked Madelon, as she enteredd her&#xD;
epusin's chamber, somewhere about 10 A. iI.~&#xD;
on the day after the concert. "I should have&#xD;
been in to see you before, but Lena reported&#xD;
that you were asleep, and I thought it a pity&#xD;
to disturb you, One should be allowed to&#xD;
sleep after achieving such a fainting-fit and&#xD;
such a sensation as you did last night. ilfa&#xD;
foi / why do you look so much astonished?&#xD;
Had you forgotten all about it?"&#xD;
"No,, indeed. I remember the fainting'&#xD;
perfectly," said Ermine, ruefully. She pre-&#xD;
sented a very woc-begone and dishevelled ap-&#xD;
pearance just then as she lay among the white&#xD;
dr4eries of the bed, her head on one pillow,&#xD;
and her hair tossed over another, dark circles'&#xD;
under her languid eyes, her lips so pale that&#xD;
they looked as if the blood had been drained&#xD;
out of them, her whole system unstrung, and&#xD;
apparently passive under the terrible reaction,&#xD;
which is the Nemesis following ~dose upon every&#xD;
excitement of the nervous temperament. "I&#xD;
remember the fainting perfectly," she con-&#xD;
tinued. "It was very foolish of me, but I could&#xD;
not help it; it came on me too suddenly. But&#xD;
I don't remember any sensation which I caused.&#xD;
I thought you were all taking it very quietly,&#xD;
when I came to myself."&#xD;
"Oh, then I suppose we were," said Made-&#xD;
Ion, sitting down on the side of the bed, and&#xD;
beginning to sniff at a flafon of cologne which&#xD;
had fallen from the slender hands that looked&#xD;
too nerveless to clasp even a bottle. "But&#xD;
Mr. Sexton, and Major Hastings, nnd the Dun.&#xD;
wardins (who had spent the evening playing&#xD;
&#xD;
whist with Aunt Victorine and Mr. ErIe), were&#xD;
all here when Raymond entered bearing the in.&#xD;
sensible form of Mademoiselle St. Amand in his&#xD;
arms! Pray, can you imagine what a sensation&#xD;
there was in that ease!"&#xD;
"Madelon, how have you the heart to treat&#xD;
inc so! You-you know you are only jesting.&#xD;
It is nbt true."&#xD;
"Jesting! Good Heavens, Ermine, can't&#xD;
you tell jest from earnest? On my honor as&#xD;
a Christian, it is every word true."&#xD;
"Those people were really here?"&#xD;
"Certainly they were-every one of them.&#xD;
Of course it is a pity"(philosophically), "for&#xD;
the Dunwardins are the greatest gossips in&#xD;
Charleston, and everybody will hear of it be-&#xD;
fore noon to-day."&#xD;
Ermine sat up in bed, pushing pack her&#xD;
'hair with both hands, and looking so piteous&#xD;
that she might have moved even her cousin's&#xD;
e~moassion.&#xD;
"0 Madelon!" (gasping as if for breath),&#xD;
" don't tell me that Raymond took me in&#xD;
there-straight in there where they all were?"&#xD;
"Yes, he did," said Madelon, decidedly.&#xD;
"' It would be a cruel kindness to keep the&#xD;
truth from you, because you will be obliged to&#xD;
hear it as soon as you go out. Instead of&#xD;
calling Aunt Victorine to see about you, he&#xD;
brought you straight into the sitting-room;&#xD;
and I think, for my part" (waxing a little&#xD;
'warm), "that it was very ungentlemanly con-&#xD;
duct."&#xD;
"It was infamous conduct," cried Ermine,&#xD;
sinking back upon her 'pillows in a wild pas-&#xD;
sion of tears, "and I will never, never, never&#xD;
forgive him for it as long as I live!"&#xD;
Madelon made no answer. In fact, the&#xD;
tears did not give her much opportunity for&#xD;
reply. She quietly waited for them to subside,&#xD;
:sniffing meanwhile, with meditative calmness,&#xD;
at the cologne, and sprinkling herself with a&#xD;
fragri~nt shower now and then.&#xD;
"Don't ~ry so, Ermine," she said at last,&#xD;
~a little sharply. '~ What on earth is the good&#xD;
of it? You'll only spoil your eyes, and make&#xD;
your head ache. I can tell you" (significant-&#xD;
ly), "you will 1e sorry if you do. Of course,&#xD;
it was outrageous in Raymond; or would have&#xD;
been outrageous, if matters had not been&#xD;
settled. I take it for granted, however, that&#xD;
you are engaged to him."&#xD;
"You know better than that," cried Er-&#xD;
mine; with a smothered, wrathful sob. "You&#xD;
know I would die first!"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mon Diete!" (with surprise which, if sim.&#xD;
elated~ was the perfection of art), "do you&#xD;
mean to say you are not engaged to him?&#xD;
Well, my dears I congratulate you upon being&#xD;
the most imprudent and the most inconsist-&#xD;
ent woman in Charleston. If I had a fancy&#xD;
to compromise myself; and to be town-talk, I&#xD;
think I should select a man whom I liked, and&#xD;
not one whom I professed to hate."&#xD;
"Profess to hate! I don't know what'you&#xD;
mean by that, Madelon. You know that I do&#xD;
hate him!"&#xD;
"I know it, do I?" said Madelon, sarcas-&#xD;
tically. "Well, really you must excuse inc if&#xD;
I differ with you on1 that point. I know you&#xD;
say you hate him; but actions speak so much&#xD;
louder than words, that incredulity is pardon-&#xD;
able."&#xD;
"What actions of mine have ever spoken&#xD;
any thing but detestation for him?" demanded&#xD;
Ermine, turning round with eyes which began&#xD;
to blaze through their tears.&#xD;
"Did your actions last night speak very&#xD;
mucl~ detestation? Instead of coming home&#xD;
from the concert, didn't you dismiss the car-&#xD;
riage and walk down to the Battery ?-didn't&#xD;
you stay there for an hour or two ?-and&#xD;
didn't you finally make your entrance in Mr.&#xD;
'Erie's arms?"&#xD;
"Don't you believe that, if I had known&#xD;
any thing about it, I would have done any&#xD;
thing before he should have touched me?"&#xD;
"I am not speaking of~ossibilities," said&#xD;
~fa~lelon, coldly. "I was simply mentioning&#xD;
facts."&#xD;
"Well, I can mention a fact also," said Er-&#xD;
mine, suddenly changing to ominous calm.&#xD;
"You wonder why I didn't come straighthome&#xD;
from the concert. I will tell you. The music&#xD;
excited me very much-as music always does&#xD;
-and when we reached here, and I saw how&#xD;
many people were assembled, I told Ray.&#xD;
mond "-the very pronunciation of his name&#xD;
cost her an effort-" that I wanted to run.&#xD;
down to the Battery and quiet myself with the&#xD;
sound of ~he water. He refused to let me go&#xD;
alone, and I refused to allow him to accom-&#xD;
pany me, so the matter would probably have&#xD;
ended by my coming in, if you had not gone to&#xD;
the window~ just then with Major Hastings.&#xD;
You remember what you said "-her eyes&#xD;
brightened and expanded until even Madelon's&#xD;
lids sank beneath their glow-"I was not more&#xD;
than a stone's-throw from you, and of course I&#xD;
heard it all. It surprised me, for I could no~&#xD;

have imagined that you would so easily recon-&#xD;
cile it to your conscience to give currency to a&#xD;
report which you knew to be false. However,&#xD;
that does not matter. Another disappoint-&#xD;
ment, more or less, is of small importance. I&#xD;
was going to say that what I heard made mc&#xD;
determine to come to an explanation with Ray.&#xD;
mend. I requested him to accompany me to&#xD;
the Battery, and I told him explicitly that&#xD;
the~ things must end, for that nothing on&#xD;
earth should ever induce me to marry him."&#xD;
"In other words, your were kind enough&#xD;
to reject him before he had ever offered him-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
"He said that too; and it hurt me no&#xD;
more from his lips that it does from yours."&#xD;
"And have you any idea what will be said&#xD;
of you-especially after last night?"&#xD;
"I am past caring what is said of me by&#xD;
any gossiping tongues whatever."&#xD;
"I can, assure you, however, that Aunt Vie-&#xD;
torine will care."&#xD;
"She will have no right to do so, since it is&#xD;
her own fault."&#xD;
"I think you will.be sorry for all this one&#xD;
day, Ermine."&#xD;
"Not half so sorry an you will be for&#xD;
lending yourself to4 such a scheme, Made-&#xD;
ion."&#xD;
"The odds are too unequal," said Madelon.&#xD;
"You will be forced to come to terms."&#xD;
Ermine clinched her hands together, and,&#xD;
pale as she had been before, grew still more&#xD;
pale with resolution, no~ with fear.&#xD;
"You will ~ she said.&#xD;
"Yes, I will see," the other rejoined. "I&#xD;
think it right to tell you~ione thing, however:&#xD;
I have made my last effort in your behaW and&#xD;
given you my last warning. I am a soldier of&#xD;
fortune, as you well know: I have my ownway&#xD;
to make in the world, by my own wits, and I&#xD;
cannot afford to let sentiment or feeling hold&#xD;
my hands. Heretofore I have tried to serve&#xD;
you-honestly tried, according to the best&#xD;
judgment I could form, little as you may think&#xD;
it. Hereafter, I shall servo myself. If my&#xD;
interest clashes with y~u'rs, I give you fair&#xD;
warning that I shall not surrender~ an inch."&#xD;
"I can credit that, Madelon," said Ermine,&#xD;
coldly. "I only do not understand why you&#xD;
should think it necessary to give such a warn-&#xD;
ing."&#xD;
"Simply because I wish the point made&#xD;
clear. I owe the world nothing," said the girl,&#xD;
setting her teeth, "and I am determined to&#xD;
&#xD;
take all that I can gain fromit, by cunning oi&#xD;
by force."&#xD;
"Why not follow Margaret's example?"&#xD;
asked Ermine, with bitter weariness. "Why&#xD;
not sell yourself to the highest bidder?"&#xD;
"Nobody has ever bid high enough,"&#xD;
answered Madelon, throwing her head back&#xD;
with the air of a De Rohan. "Poor as I am,&#xD;
I have that which many a millionnairess lacks,&#xD;
the knowledge how to spend wealth. Oh, if I&#xD;
were "~clasping her hands with that dra-&#xD;
matic feri'&amp;amp;r which comes by nature to all of&#xD;
French blood-"juste Giel! what a grands&#xD;
dame I could be!"&#xD;
"What a pitiful ambition!~~ said Ermine~~&#xD;
face-though not her lips. Then she added&#xD;
aloud: "I wonder you don't consider what a&#xD;
sinful thing such an inordinate desire for wealth&#xD;
is; and to what consequences it may lead. It&#xD;
seems to me that it is at the bottom of nearly&#xD;
every crime of earth since our Lord Himself&#xD;
was betrayed for thirty pieces of silver."&#xD;
"Why don't you preach to Margaret?"&#xD;
asked Madelon, with her trenchant sneer.&#xD;
"She practices, while I only theorize."&#xD;
"Margaret has not a tenth part of your&#xD;
sense, Madelon, and therefore she is not a&#xD;
tenth part as accountable. Besides" (with a&#xD;
sigh), "she is only making a ~nariage de con.&#xD;
penance, as hundreds of other women do. No&#xD;
doubt she will be happy enough. She will&#xD;
have laces and j&amp;amp;els in abundance, and they&#xD;
constitute happiness for her.. But you-you&#xD;
are different."&#xD;
"I hope so indeed," said Madelon, shrug-&#xD;
ging her shoulders, "By.the-by, I must not&#xD;
forget that I have two items of news for you.&#xD;
First, that Mr. Sexton has been formally ac;&#xD;
cepted."&#xD;
"I am not surprised at that," said Ermine&#xD;
-and a vision of Raymond's face seemed to&#xD;
rise before her as she had seen it behin ar-&#xD;
garet's chair the night before.&#xD;
"Secondly, that Captain Erle, of the ood&#xD;
ship Adventure, has delighted his loving rela-&#xD;
tions by an appearance this morning.&#xD;
Ermine started, and a flash of rapture came&#xD;
over her face; bathing every feature in such a&#xD;
flood of radiance that, for a moment, she&#xD;
looked fairly transfigured.&#xD;
"Alan!" she cried, eagerly. "0 Madelon,&#xD;
has Alan come?"&#xD;
"Do you suppose I would be likely to tell&#xD;
you so, if he had not?"&#xD;
"And is he here-down-stairs?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"I left him at the breakfast-table when I&#xD;
came up.&#xD;
"And why did you not tell me before? To&#xD;
think that I should have stayed here all this&#xD;
while, and my dear boy down-stairs! Ring the&#xD;
bell for Lena, please, Madelon-I must get up&#xD;
at once."&#xD;
"And make yourself sick."&#xD;
"WJ~o cares? But I shall not; Alan is&#xD;
better Pr me than any tonic. Oh, why don't&#xD;
Lena come? I am so afraid he will go some-&#xD;
where before I can get down!"&#xD;
"I don't think there is the least fear of&#xD;
that; but I can go and tell him that you will&#xD;
be down, if you like."&#xD;
"Yes, thanks, I should like it, if you don't&#xD;
mind~ Tell him he has made me well-or no!&#xD;
Don't tell him that, because he ivill ask what&#xD;
is the matter with me, and I would rather he&#xD;
did not hear about my folly last night."&#xD;
"You may set your mind at rest on that&#xD;
score," said Madelon, coolly. "I left Aunt&#xD;
XTi~torine giving him a minute account of it&#xD;
when I caine up.&#xD;
"0 Madelon! how could she?"&#xD;
"Nonsense, 1~rmine! Could she know by&#xD;
intuition that you did not want Captain Erie&#xD;
to hear of your!flirtation with his brother?"&#xD;
"Madelon, how dare you say such a thing?&#xD;
I never flirted with anybody-much less with&#xD;
Rayniond-in m&#xD;
"Then I have azingly little idea of what&#xD;
flirtation is! However, we won't come to&#xD;
blows; our 'little hands were never made,'&#xD;
etc. And, fortunately, here comes Lena to&#xD;
keep the peace. Au revoii-."&#xD;
Enter Lena, and exit Mademoiselle Lautrec,&#xD;
singing as she went. Ermine heard her clear&#xD;
voice lilting " Chagrin d'Amoui-" all the way&#xD;
down-stairs; and, as she went to her toilet,&#xD;
she could not help wondering how much heart&#xD;
her brilliant cousin really possessed. It Was&#xD;
a question which everybody who knew Made-&#xD;
ion was sooner ~r later forced to ask, and&#xD;
which nobody had ver yet been able to answer&#xD;
to his or her satisfaction.&#xD;
Ermine, as a general rule, was remarkably&#xD;
dilatory about dressing, but on the present oc-&#xD;
casion she went to the business with such a&#xD;
rush of energy (energy which might have as-&#xD;
tonished Lena, if that astute personage had&#xD;
not known the cause of it perfectly well), that&#xD;
her toilet was soon an accomplished fact,&#xD;
every garment donned, every ribbon tied, every&#xD;
hair in its place, if hairs so 'wandering could&#xD;
&#xD;
possibly be said to have a place. ~3he gave one&#xD;
last glance in the mirror when all was com-&#xD;
pleted, saw the graceful figure, clad in mi~ty,&#xD;
transparent white, the sweet, low-browed face,&#xD;
the delicate, sensitive lips, the wonderful eyes,&#xD;
crossed with a shade of languor through all&#xD;
their happiness, and, giving one last touch to&#xD;
the coral-tinted ribbon tied lit a careless knot&#xD;
at her throat, went down.&#xD;
What a day it was which came with fra-&#xD;
grant kisses to her languid brow, as she crossed&#xD;
the lovely, marble-paved hail, the wide-open&#xD;
doors of which let in bounteously the glory&#xD;
outside! The smile of God seemed to rest&#xD;
upon our insigniflci~nt planet, making it for a&#xD;
time almost as fair as heaven's self. It was a&#xD;
triple bridal of earth and sea and sky, which&#xD;
was taking place out where the shining waves&#xD;
were coming so gently to kiss the blooming&#xD;
land; and far, far in the lucid depths of&#xD;
sky-&#xD;
"Where, through a sapphire sea, the sun&#xD;
Sailed like a golden galleon! "-&#xD;
straight on to that high noontide splendor,&#xD;
when men, perforce,~ must veil their faces&#xD;
from the transcending beams of his majesty,&#xD;
and only Nature can still look bravely up-&#xD;
ward, with "till her quaint, enamelled eyes "-&#xD;
sending the while sweet odors, like holy&#xD;
prayers, on every breath of the capricious&#xD;
south wind, which kissed the "plumy palms"&#xD;
of the tropics, before it came to roll ?he&#xD;
sparkling waves upon their golden sand, and&#xD;
die like a god on a royal couch of perfumed&#xD;
roses.&#xD;
These same roses were sending their mes-&#xD;
sages into the sitting-room-filling every nook&#xD;
and corner with a fragrance like no other fra-&#xD;
grance of earth-when Ermine entered. How&#xD;
many people were in the room she. did not&#xD;
know. On crossing the threshold she saw but&#xD;
one face, a bronzed, handsome, thorough-bred&#xD;
face, with limpid eyes, half-blue, half-green, as&#xD;
if they had caught their tint from the sea on&#xD;
which they loved to gaze, smiling a welcome to&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"Alan! Alan! I am so glad to see you&#xD;
again!" was all she could say, as she felt the&#xD;
clasp of those kind hands which embodied&#xD;
almost the whole of tenderness that her life&#xD;
had known.&#xD;
"Glad to ~ee me! I wonder if any words&#xD;
can make you understand how I have wearied&#xD;
for a sight of you-wearied until I knew what&#xD;
it was to be homesick even on the blue water!"&#xD;
&#xD;
'4&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC8067-00000020"/>&#xD;
/&#xD;
&#xD;
"SEE, THE CONQUERING HERO COMES!"&#xD;
&#xD;
said the voice, for the sound of which her soul&#xD;
had thirsted even as men, fainting in a desert,&#xD;
thirst for a draught of cool water. "My pet!&#xD;
my pet! what have they been doing to you, that&#xD;
you look so pale?&#xD;
"I am always pale," said Ermine, gazing&#xD;
up at him with the air of one who, having en-&#xD;
tered some long-desired haven of repose, has&#xD;
neither wish nor care left.&#xD;
"Pale! Do you think I don't know that?&#xD;
You were always a lily, but such a pure and&#xD;
stately lily. Now you droop your white petals&#xD;
wearily."&#xD;
"Do I, Alan?"&#xD;
"Yes, you do. And your eyes-they are&#xD;
happy but so languid-as if you were tired in&#xD;
spirit. Come here, and let me look at you.&#xD;
Unless I have lost all my skill, I can soon tell&#xD;
what is the matter with you."&#xD;
"Nothing is the matter withmc now I have&#xD;
seen you," said Ermine with a childish truth-&#xD;
fulness. She was a woman with Raymond-&#xD;
a woman who could hold her own against any&#xD;
odds. But wit~ Alan she was still as much a&#xD;
child-as purel1~r and simply at her ease.-as on&#xD;
that by-gone d~y when he had taken her and&#xD;
all her misery into his arms. As he led her&#xD;
across the floor to the full light of one of those&#xD;
windows through which the sweet breath of&#xD;
the roses came, she noticed for the first time&#xD;
that by some rare, happy chance, the room was&#xD;
empty of all save they two. Where all the&#xD;
rest were-her mother, Margaret, Madelon-&#xD;
she did not pause to wonder. It was enough&#xD;
that Fate for once had been so kin~. She sank&#xD;
with a deep sigh of satisfaction into the easy-&#xD;
chair whiph Alan drew forward, and folding&#xD;
her hands in her lap-they were absurdl~f&#xD;
small, those hands-glanced up at him with an&#xD;
expression of perfect beatitude.&#xD;
"Sit down there," she said, pointing to a&#xD;
low chair in front of her. "I want to look at&#xD;
you, and I cannot do so unless you are on a&#xD;
level with me. Now, that is it. Alan" (gaz-&#xD;
ing at him critically after he had olleyed),&#xD;
"you-are-browner than you wore!"&#xD;
"Then we are quits, since you are whiter&#xD;
than you were," replied Alan, who had man-&#xD;
aged to accommodate himself not very ungrace-&#xD;
fully in the small chair aforesaid, and looked&#xD;
as well contented with his quarters as Ermine&#xD;
did with hers.&#xD;
"How often must I tell you that my&#xD;
paleness is of Natu~-e?" said she. "If you&#xD;
talk of it much more, I will buy or borrow&#xD;
&#xD;
some rouge and use it for your especial&#xD;
benefit."&#xD;
"That would be to paint the lily, indeed.&#xD;
No" (shaking his head), "I see how it is: they&#xD;
have been bullying you among them nIl, while&#xD;
I was away."&#xD;
"No, Alan; on my honor, no."&#xD;
"On your honor, Minnikin?"&#xD;
"Yes, on my honor. Ah, you don't know&#xD;
me" (shaking her head in turn), "I have such&#xD;
a bad temper that nobody could bully me!"&#xD;
"Who ought to know you better than I?&#xD;
Didn't I have the onerous duty of bringing&#xD;
you up? Don't try to abuse yourself to me,&#xD;
for it is perfectly unnecessary, I assure you. I&#xD;
know all the good, and all the bad, of you;&#xD;
and~~O child, child, how little there is of the&#xD;
latter 1"&#xD;
"I am glad you think so, Alan, but indeed&#xD;
I am very wicked."&#xD;
"Are you ?"(with a half.amused, half-sad&#xD;
sigh), "then God knows I wish I was wicked,&#xD;
too. Perhaps those dear little white hands&#xD;
might come and teach inc of their own ac-&#xD;
cord."&#xD;
The dear little white hands in question&#xD;
came, at this, and smoothed back the short,&#xD;
thick curls-not exactly gold,'nor yet exactly&#xD;
brown, but something between the two-from&#xD;
the broad, unmanned brow which lay under&#xD;
them like a snow-drift.&#xD;
"Alan," said the gentle voice, soft and&#xD;
sweet as Cordelia's own, "I hope my hands&#xD;
will wither away, if ever they become too good&#xD;
to touch you-you, who alone have kept my&#xD;
heart from wither all these years."&#xD;
"And do you kn what you have kept&#xD;
mine, Ermine?"&#xD;
"A little warm, I tins ; a little conscious&#xD;
of prayers and blessings following you when&#xD;
you were tossing about on the ocean."&#xD;
"A little pure, too," said the young man,&#xD;
sinking his voice slightly. "lam sinful enough,&#xD;
God knows-it is hard to live a man's life in&#xD;
the world and not to be-but I might have&#xD;
been infinitely worse had it not been for you,&#xD;
Ermine, you stainless lily, praying for me&#xD;
(God bless you! ) far way. Often your sweet&#xD;
eyes have risen and' shamed away some devil's&#xD;
thought from my soul. Often your sweet voice&#xD;
has come to still some tempest, such as you&#xD;
cannot even dream of; in my heart. I wonder,&#xD;
sometimes, what you have ever found worth&#xD;
caring for, worth praying for, in a great, rough&#xD;
fellow like myselV'&#xD;
&#xD;
"What did you find worth caring for in&#xD;
the fretful, tiresome child whom you saw and&#xD;
comforted long ago?"&#xD;
"I found the warmest heart and the sweet-&#xD;
est nature in all the world," said he, taking the&#xD;
tiny, lissome hands and brushing them with&#xD;
his heavily-mustached lips. "How you cricd&#xD;
yourself to sleep in my arms -~hat day! I&#xD;
shall never forget your poor, littl~, pale, tear-&#xD;
drenched face, with its great, dark, tired eyes!&#xD;
Do you know that something in your appear-&#xD;
ance when you caine into the room a while ago&#xD;
recalled that homesick child to me, and I felt&#xD;
\strongly inclined-foolish enough, wasn't it?&#xD;
~to comfort you again as I comforted you&#xD;
then?"&#xD;
For the first time in her life Ermine felt&#xD;
that she was blushing under Alan's gaze and&#xD;
Alan's words. She began to wish that she&#xD;
was not facing that flood of relentless light&#xD;
from the window, as she felt the roseate flush&#xD;
coming like a wave into her alabaster cheeks.&#xD;
"Your presence is comfort enough," she&#xD;
said, meeting the limpid eyes with her soft,&#xD;
dark orbs. "You don't know how uneasy I&#xD;
have been about you. Your letters sa you&#xD;
would probably be here the first of May, dl&#xD;
haunted the Battery daily, until yesterday&#xD;
mamma forbade it."&#xD;
"And so you concluded to stay in bed to-&#xD;
day! Was that the reason I was so grievous-&#xD;
ly disappointed when I came in and did not&#xD;
find you at the breakfast-table?"&#xD;
"No," said Ermine, appreciating this art-&#xD;
ful trap as it deserved. "I stayed in bed be-&#xD;
cause I was not welL"&#xD;
"And why were you not well? Aunt Vie-&#xD;
torine told me that you fainted last night.&#xD;
What made you faint?"&#xD;
"The reaction from excitement, I suppose.&#xD;
I painted hard all day, and heard some glori-&#xD;
ous music at night. Between the two I was&#xD;
color-mad and sound-drunk. So, when the&#xD;
excitement was spent, I made a fool of myself&#xD;
and fainted."&#xD;
"And Raymond-confound him !-brought&#xD;
you home."&#xD;
"Yes, Raymond brought me home."&#xD;
Silence for a while. Captain Erle gnawed&#xD;
his mustache, and looked out of the window,&#xD;
while Ermine let her loving gaze linger on ltim.&#xD;
"They will kill you among them," the for-&#xD;
mer said, at last, in a tone of exasperation.&#xD;
"From your mother down, they know nothing&#xD;
about you, and every thing they do is harm~&#xD;
&#xD;
instead of good. The life you are leading&#xD;
here is written in your pale face and your&#xD;
weary eyes. Ermine" (with sudden energy),&#xD;
"you need not deny it, they have been trying&#xD;
to make you do something. Was it" (with&#xD;
rising wrath) "to marry Raymond?"&#xD;
"Nobody has been trying to make me do&#xD;
any thing," said Ermine, astonished at the&#xD;
astuteness of this marine gentleman. "You&#xD;
forget that I have my dear guardian to whom&#xD;
I could apply, if any thing of the kind were&#xD;
attempted. As for ~a~ond" (indignantly),&#xD;
"I detest him."&#xD;
"Do you really, Ermine?"&#xD;
"How can you apk me such a question,&#xD;
Alan? You know Ido."&#xD;
" Then" (with a deep breath) "thank God&#xD;
for that load gone! Ermine, my pet, do you&#xD;
know that when I came in this morning they&#xD;
all hinted, if they did not assert, that you were&#xD;
engaged to him?"&#xD;
"But you did not believe it, Alan?"&#xD;
"Not I, until I saw you. But when you&#xD;
came in, like a pale little statue stepped from&#xD;
a niche in some cathedral, I thought they&#xD;
might have bullied you into measures. But&#xD;
you are all right, and I am as happy as an ad-&#xD;
miral ! "&#xD;
"Foolish boy," but her smile was a caress;&#xD;
"we have been having a liberal allowance of&#xD;
reasonsn, stratagems, and spoils,' however.&#xD;
Do you know that Margaret is engaged?"&#xD;
"And Madelon, to9, I hope. There's in-&#xD;
flammable material in that girl, and the sooner&#xD;
r,~he is safely tied in the halter of matrimony&#xD;
the better. Apropos of halters, Ermine, would&#xD;
you like to go to ride this afternoon?"&#xD;
"Oh, of all things, if I can-if mamma&#xD;
will let mc!"&#xD;
"We'll make her let you," said he, gayly.&#xD;
"A sailor on land is like a school-boy at home&#xD;
for the holidays-a priylleged character, whom&#xD;
it is everybody's duty to humor and amuse.&#xD;
Here comes Aunt Victorine I will ask her."&#xD;
Mrs. Erle entered at the moment, and Er-&#xD;
mine at once understood why this tfte-d-t~fte&#xD;
had been permitted. Astonishment and vexa-&#xD;
tion were plainly legible on the lady's face, as&#xD;
she caught sight of that confidential scene at&#xD;
the window: ~he had evidently fancied her&#xD;
daughter safe in her chamber and in bed.&#xD;
"You here, Ermine I" she said. "I was&#xD;
just on my way to your room to forbid your&#xD;
exerting yourself by getting up to-day. I&#xD;
should have been there before, but I had to&#xD;

Miss l~Torth, Mrs. Erle had eschewed a resident&#xD;
governess and employed day-teachers, who,&#xD;
as a general rule, were changed every two or&#xD;
three weeks.) "You look wretchedly," she&#xD;
went on. "I must insist on your going back&#xD;
to your room and lying down, while I send for&#xD;
Dr. 'Juthbert."&#xD;
"Dr. Cuthbert does me no good, mamma,'~&#xD;
said Ermiac, wearily. "Please let me stay.&#xD;
I feel so much better down here than I did up-&#xD;
stairs."&#xD;
"You are excited again,~~ aid'~frs. Erle,&#xD;
feeling her ~ulse. "The next thing will be&#xD;
another fainting-fit. I must in i~t on your&#xD;

"Let me prescribe for her," sMd Captain&#xD;
Erle, ~vho had risen, and stood tall ~ad stately&#xD;
by the window. "Let, her go t6 ride this&#xD;
afternoon, and I ~~ill wagnr~anytihing that we&#xD;
hear no more of fainting ts."&#xD;
Ermine looked imploringly into her moth-&#xD;
er's face, but a flint could not have been&#xD;
harder than that pleasant, gracious c6unte-&#xD;
nanee.&#xD;
"Impossible!" she said. "It would be&#xD;
The most perfect folly, and, in her present&#xD;
weak state, might bring on a serious illness.&#xD;
Ermine, I insist on your going to/your room."&#xD;
"Very well, mamma," said Ermine, rising;&#xD;
"if you insist, I can go. But it is very use-&#xD;
less.-Good-by, Alan!"&#xD;
"Good-by, St. Agnes," said Alan, smiling,&#xD;
as h9 clasped the soft hand extended to him.&#xD;
The clasp, the smile, went up-stairs with&#xD;
the poor little, lamb-like martyr, and sweetened&#xD;
herexile more than ~t is possible for words to&#xD;
tell. After all, what did any thing else matter?&#xD;
Alan had come t&#xD;
-4--&#xD;
~Th CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
STRATAGEMS AND SPOiLS.&#xD;
ERMINE discovered, before long, however,&#xD;
that there were a few things which still&#xD;
mattered to the degree of discomfort-even&#xD;
though Alan had come home. Having been&#xD;
remanded to her chamber, and feeling too&#xD;
happy and lazy even to paint, she subsided&#xD;
into a chair before the open window, and,&#xD;
leaning her arms on the broad sill, bathed&#xD;
&#xD;
herself in the glory and beauty of the day&#xD;
like a very sun-flower. Looking out on the&#xD;
green, happy earth, the wide, laughing water,&#xD;
or far up into the blue, intensely blue sky,&#xD;
arching over all things4ike the dome of some&#xD;
vast cathedral, it was easy to be happy even&#xD;
without any tangible cause; easy to lose one's&#xD;
self ia vague, sweet dreams, and vaguer,&#xD;
sweeter fancies; easy to forget that there&#xD;
were such things as sin and suffering on earth,&#xD;
that, under this hyacinthine sky, hearts were&#xD;
breaking, sobs were uttered, nurses breathed,&#xD;
death-gasps given, souls, alike of sinners and&#xD;
of saints, going forth on the wings of every&#xD;
idle, golden minute, to face the justice of Him&#xD;
who, mid all the mad carnival of human mis-&#xD;
ery, insanity, and crime, is still "patient be-&#xD;
cause eternal." On many a changeless, dead&#xD;
face throughout the smiling land, these quiver-&#xD;
ing sunbeams fell, yet they brought none the&#xD;
less of life-giving warmth in their touch when&#xD;
they glanced athwart the happy face, pillowed&#xD;
on a pair of soft, white arms, in this open&#xD;
window. 0 lovely and ~most loving face! It&#xD;
was well, indeed, that the world had little to&#xD;
do with your short life, that its kiss was never&#xD;
laid on your sweet lips, or weighed down earth-&#xD;
ward the jids of your pathetic eyes. It was&#xD;
truly well, for, among all those glorious bless-&#xD;
ings and tender promises which we call "the&#xD;
beatitudes," what so glorious, what so full of&#xD;
tenderness as the one which tells us that&#xD;
~"blessed are the clean of heart: for they shall&#xD;
see God?"&#xD;
But golden as Ermine's day-dream was,&#xD;
it did~ not remain uninterrupted. In such&#xD;
trances, we literally "count time by heart-&#xD;
throbs, not by moments," ~so she had no&#xD;
means of telling what exact number of sec-&#xD;
onds elapsed from the time she sank intn her&#xD;
chair, to the time when a knoe)c sounded on&#xD;
the door. "Come in," she ~ lazily, and,&#xD;
lifting her face, looked round as the door&#xD;
opened. To her surprise, Margaret stood on&#xD;
the threshold.&#xD;
"I suppose I may come in," said the lat-&#xD;
ter, hesitating a moment under her step-sis-&#xD;
ter's involuntary glance of surprise. "I&#xD;
thought you were in bed, Ermine."&#xD;
Oh, certainly, come in," said Ermine, ris-&#xD;
ing and drawing forward a chair. "No: I am&#xD;
not in bed-I dressed to go down and see&#xD;
Alan, but mamma insisted on my coming back&#xD;
to my room, though" (with a sigh) "I am&#xD;
sure it was very unnecessary. It is kind qf&#xD;
&#xD;
you to come and see me, Margaret. Sit&#xD;
down."&#xD;
Margaret sat down-a billowy mass of&#xD;
blue drapery, crowned by a lovely but most&#xD;
pettish face. Signs of storm, past, present,&#xD;
and to come, were written on the vivid coral&#xD;
lips, in the violet eyes half veiled by their&#xD;
milk-white lids, on the brow l~ke smoothest&#xD;
marble or finest satin, drawn just now into a&#xD;
petulant frown of discontent.&#xD;
"I am sure I think you look as well as&#xD;
usual, Erm~ne,'~ she said, with a half-offended,&#xD;
half-aggrieved intonation of voice. "Fainting&#xD;
seems to agree with you; and it was a very&#xD;
nice way to get up an interesting scene, and&#xD;
let everybody know the degree of your inti-&#xD;
macy with Raymond."&#xD;
"You are tuistaken," said Ermine, coldly&#xD;
-she was so well used to the beautiful god-&#xD;
dess's ebullitions of spleen, that neither the&#xD;
tone nor the form of this address surprised&#xD;
her-" fainting does not agree with me, for&#xD;
Alau says he never saw me look so badly&#xD;
and, ss for getting up a scene to let everybody&#xD;
know my intimacy with Raymond, considering&#xD;
that I am not intimate with him, I don't see&#xD;
why I should have wished to leave the im-&#xD;
pressioll on anybody's mind."&#xD;
"Not Intimate with him!" repeated Mar.&#xD;
garet, in a high key. "Not intimate with&#xD;
im, when you are out together at all hours&#xD;
o~ the day and night, when you faint in his&#xD;
9)rms, and when" (a still higher key) "every.&#xD;
body says you ought to be engaged to him, if&#xD;
you are not 1"&#xD;
"Did anybody ever say that to you, Mar-&#xD;
garet?"&#xD;
"Yes, plenty of people-Mrs. Dunwardin&#xD;
said it when she went away last night."&#xD;
"Then give Mrs. Dunwardin my compli-&#xD;
ments the next time you see her, and request&#xD;
her to be kind enough to mind her own busi-&#xD;
ness."&#xD;
"Ohit is very fine to carry off matters in&#xD;
that way; but telling people to mind their&#xD;
own business-which is very uncivil and un-&#xD;
lady-like, by-the-way-won't keep them from&#xD;
talking. Of course you don't care, though"&#xD;
(relapsin~ into grievance); "as long as you&#xD;
can play off Raymond against Ah~n, and Alan&#xD;
against Raymond, it makes no matter to you&#xD;
u~4at people say."&#xD;
- "Margaret, such nonsense is not worth&#xD;
getting angry over," said Ermine, with deter-&#xD;
mined calmness, though two scarlet spots be-&#xD;
&#xD;
gan to burn in her white cheeks. "Will you&#xD;
excuse me if I ask you to change the subject ?&#xD;
I am very tired of my unfortunate escapade of&#xD;
last night; and Raymond's name is fairly hate-&#xD;
ful to me!"&#xD;
"Oh, no doubt it is hateful to you since&#xD;
Alan has come back!" cried Margaret, with&#xD;
quivering lips, and eyes that blazed through&#xD;
all their odalisque softness. "It was very&#xD;
far from being hateful to you when you stayed&#xD;
on the Battery till after midnight last night,&#xD;
however! I wonder you are not ashamed to&#xD;
play fast-and-loose in such a disgraceful man-&#xD;
ner?"&#xD;
"Margaret, I w9n't tolerate this !" said&#xD;
Ermine, rising. "You have no possible right.&#xD;
to speak to inc in such a manner, and I will&#xD;
not listen to it."&#xD;
"You shall listen to it!" said Margaret,&#xD;
rising, too, and stamping her foot to give&#xD;
emphasis to her words. "I have the best&#xD;
possible right to speak, for you took Ray..&#xD;
mond from me to make a Wy of him for your&#xD;
amusement. Don't I love him better than&#xD;
anybody else in the world?" cried the girl,.&#xD;
with a ring of pathos through all the vitupera~&#xD;
tivo passion of her voice-" and am I not&#xD;
forced to marry this horrid Saxton, while you&#xD;
-you who might be happy with him, throw&#xD;
him away for a disgiace-"&#xD;
"Hush !" said Ermine, with eyes blazing:&#xD;
in turn. "Say what you please to me, and,&#xD;
for the sake of Christian charity, I will bear&#xD;
it; but you shall not say any thing about&#xD;
Alan! I won't stand that!"&#xD;
"Really, it seems to me that Alan is my&#xD;
cousin, and that unless you are engaged to&#xD;
him, he is nothing to you."&#xD;
"He is a hundred times more to me than&#xD;
any cousinahip can make him to you; and, as.&#xD;
I told you a moment ago, ybu may say any&#xD;
thing you please to me, but you shall say'&#xD;
nothing of him."&#xD;
"I have no desire to say any thing of him&#xD;
-there is nothing to be said. I only want to.&#xD;
tell you that I might have forgiven you for&#xD;
taking Raymond from me if you had loved&#xD;
him and married him; but that I will never~&#xD;
never forgive you for making him leave me,,&#xD;
only that you might treat him like this!"&#xD;
For the first time Ermine saw how this&#xD;
beautiful, tame face-this face so often petu-&#xD;
lant, so rarely moved by any deeper expression~&#xD;
-looked, when convulsed, changed, intensi-&#xD;
fied by the master-passion of human nature,.&#xD;

&#xD;
the passion which had stirred even this shal-&#xD;
low nature to its depths. Through her preoc-&#xD;
cupation-her pity mingled with indignation-&#xD;
the quick artist-eye caught, the retentive ar-&#xD;
tist - mind remembered, the transformation,&#xD;
and many a long day afterward the same face&#xD;
stood out clearly on canvas-a loveliness elo-&#xD;
quent of rage and scorn.&#xD;
- "Margaret," she said, gently, "stop a mo-&#xD;
*ment, and be reasonable. How did I ever&#xD;
make Raymond leave you? Have I not&#xD;
discouraged him always, and always plainly&#xD;
showed that I did not like him? Do you&#xD;
think that, because~ you find him attractive,&#xD;
everybody else must do the same? I assure&#xD;
you that, if any thing could make me despise&#xD;
him. more than I have always done, it has&#xD;
been the manner in which he has treated you."&#xD;
"It is no affair of yours how he has treated&#xD;
me," cried Margaret, with a foolish woman's&#xD;
illogical wrath. "Do you suppose I imagine&#xD;
that he gave mc up for ~jou?" she went on,&#xD;
with a scornful laugh. "It is some consola-&#xD;
tion that it was for your fortune, not for your-&#xD;
Self; that he left me."&#xD;
"I am perfectly well aware of that fact,"&#xD;
said Ermine, coldly. "But I cannot realize&#xD;
the consolation of it. One would not despise&#xD;
a man for being fickle, but one would despise&#xD;
him for being mercenary. -&#xD;
"And do you flatter yourself that your new&#xD;
lover is any more disinterested?" asked Mar-&#xD;
garet, bitterly.&#xD;
Ermine drew up her slender .~lane~ figure&#xD;
haughtily. "I do no~ know of whom you are&#xD;
speaking," she ~aid, proudly.&#xD;
"You may find out some day," said Mar-&#xD;
garet with a slight gasp-a premonition of&#xD;
hysteria-in her throat. "Biit it is hard that&#xD;
I am the only one to be sacrificed," she went&#xD;
on, sinking bac1~ into her chair, while a shower&#xD;
of sudden tears washed all the fire out of her&#xD;
eyes. "You are not made to marry Raymond&#xD;
-though he told me only last night that it is&#xD;
a matter of life and death to him that yoti&#xD;
should do so-while I am sacrificed to this&#xD;
her-horrible man whom I detest!" -&#xD;
"You are not a Circassian," said Ermine,&#xD;
with an inflection of unconscious contempt in&#xD;
her voice. "Nobody could sacrifice you, if you&#xD;
did not sacrifice yourself."&#xD;
"It is easy for you to talk!" said Margaret,&#xD;
indignantly. "You are rich, and your own&#xD;
mistress; nobody can force you to do any thing.&#xD;
But I am different."&#xD;
&#xD;
"You are a puppet in Raymond's hands,&#xD;
and for Raymond's selfish, mercenary pur-&#xD;
poses," said Ermine, indignantly, in her turn.&#xD;
"Do you suppose that I don't know that you&#xD;
accepted Mr. Sexton at his bidding? It is in-&#xD;
comprehensible to me that you should suffer&#xD;
his influence over you, when he uses it for such&#xD;
an end as th~. Margaret, for Heaven's sake,&#xD;
ask yourself could he ever liave loved you&#xD;
and yet urge you-force you-to such a step&#xD;
as this?"&#xD;
"Whit can you know of his love?" asked&#xD;
Margaret, blazing out once more. "Is it im-&#xD;
possible for any one to love me? Plenty of&#xD;
people have done so besides Raymond; you&#xD;
know that/as well as I do. He did love me,&#xD;
but he sa~ d-he still says-that we are too&#xD;
poor to marry, that we should only drag each&#xD;
other do~wn, instead of benefiting each other.&#xD;
That I must sacrifice myself to make a brilliant&#xD;
match, and he-and he-"&#xD;
"And he will magnanimously sacrifice him-&#xD;
self to my fortune," said Ermine, smiling sar-&#xD;
castically. "It is quite an able programme,&#xD;
and I congratulate you upon carrying out your&#xD;
share of it so well. I wonder" (this to her-&#xD;
self; as she turned and looked out of the win-&#xD;
dow) "if that man ever spoke the truth in all&#xD;
his life?"&#xD;
But meanwhile Margarct's second explosion,&#xD;
like the first, was quickly drenched in a lach-&#xD;
rymal shower-bath, and noticing that the sobs&#xD;
were momently becoming more hysterical, Er-&#xD;
mine began to think of some mode to allay this&#xD;
tempest in a teapot.&#xD;
"Margaret," she said, "if the idea of marry-&#xD;
ing Mr. Sexton makes you so unhappy, why&#xD;
not ask your father to break the engage-&#xD;
ment?"&#xD;
No answer-only louder sobs, and more&#xD;
threateningly hysterical signs about the throat.&#xD;
"I have told Raymond that I can never&#xD;
marry him," Ermine continued, thinking that&#xD;
this information might prove comforting. "If&#xD;
your engagement with Mr. Sexton were broke~i,&#xD;
you might-"&#xD;
What Miss Erle might or might not haVe&#xD;
done can 'only be surmised~ for the consolir~g&#xD;
suggestiOll was very abruptly cut short.&#xD;
"I can do no-thing b-but marry Mr. Sax-&#xD;
ton!" cried Margaret, as vehemently as her&#xD;
sobs would permit. "Somebody must besa-&#xD;
sacrificed, and of course I am the one! You&#xD;
can do as you plc-please, but I hate you&#xD;
w-worse than anybody in the world, and I&#xD;
&#xD;
will never, never forgive you for the way you&#xD;
have treated Raymond!"&#xD;
"Good Heavens, Margaret I "-began Er-&#xD;
mine, confounded by the extraordinary logic of&#xD;
this resentment.&#xD;
But Masgaret was past listening to any&#xD;
thing by this time. Violent hysterics set in, ac-&#xD;
companied by the usual kicking and screaming&#xD;
symptoms, and Ermine flew to the bell. Her&#xD;
first energetic peal brought Lena hurrying up.&#xD;
stairs-for it was not often that her mistress's&#xD;
bell ranglike this-and; as Margaret was bythis&#xD;
time very nearly unmanageable, Mrs. ErIe was&#xD;
summoned. It was surprising how her pres-&#xD;
ence, the first moment she crossed the thresh-&#xD;
old, had a sedative effect upon her step.&#xD;
daughter.1 The screams died away, the kick.&#xD;
ing subsided, and even the sobs soon became&#xD;
less convulsive. By the time that Madelon,&#xD;
the governess, the children, and half a dozen&#xD;
servants arrived on the scene of action, Miss&#xD;
Erle had subsided into an unconscious condi-&#xD;
tion, and was borne away to her own room-&#xD;
notwithstanding Madelon's unfeeling assur-&#xD;
rance to the company in general that she was&#xD;
sure she could walk-without furthefresist.&#xD;
ance-a beautiful but decidedly heavy piece&#xD;
of inert flesh and blood.&#xD;
The train moved away after her-all ex-&#xD;
cept Mrs. Erle, who, giving a few directions to&#xD;
illadelon (over which the latter shrugged her&#xD;
shoulders), came back into Ermine's chamber&#xD;
and closed the door.&#xD;
"My patience is almost exhausted with that&#xD;
girl," she said, sinking down into the chair&#xD;
which Margaret had vacated. "I scarcely&#xD;
know whether her folly or her affectation is&#xD;
most trying. What brought on this scene, Er-&#xD;
mine?"&#xD;
Now, Ermine was perfectly well aware that&#xD;
her mother knew as well as herself what had&#xD;
brought on the scene, but she had lived long&#xD;
enough with Mrs. Erle to give the answer which&#xD;
was expected ~f her.&#xD;
"Margaret has been talking about her&#xD;
aversion to marrying Mr. Sexton," she said,&#xD;
and she worked herself into the state in&#xD;
which you found her by simply giving way to&#xD;
her excitement."&#xD;
"AhI" said Mrs. ErIe, with a world of.&#xD;
meaning in the single interjection, and then&#xD;
sue looked full into her daughter's eyes. -&#xD;
"Was she talking of anybody besides Mr.&#xD;
Sexton?" she asked, with a slight shade of sig-&#xD;
nificance.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes," answered Ermine, indifferently.&#xD;
"She was talking of Raymond."&#xD;
"What of him ~"&#xD;
"Indeed, mamma, that is hard to say, for&#xD;
her complaints were rather obscure and very&#xD;
inconsistent. She was apparently angry that&#xD;
Raymond had transferred his attentions from&#xD;
her to myself; and yet outraged that I had not&#xD;
accepted them. I did not sce the reason of&#xD;
it," she concluded with a tired sigh.&#xD;
"Did you expect reason from a jealous and&#xD;
very silly woman?'~ asked Mrs. ErIe, con-&#xD;
temptuously. "I am sure you know Margaret&#xD;
well enough to be aware how little credit is&#xD;
due to any thing she may say. She has ac-&#xD;
cepted Mr. Sexton of her own accord, yet she&#xD;
gives herself the airs of a martyr, and, because&#xD;
she has chosen to fancy herself in love with&#xD;
Raymond, she thinks that she has a fee-simple&#xD;
right over him. You will be doing him a&#xD;
grievous injustice, Ermine" (this very earnest-&#xD;
ly), "if you allow Margarct's jealous folly to&#xD;
prejudice you in any way against him."&#xD;
"Margaret's jealous folly, as you term it,&#xD;
mamma, does not weigh with me in the least;&#xD;
but what I have seen with my own eyes&#xD;
and heard with my own ears, I confess that I&#xD;
believe."&#xD;
"You mean-?"&#xD;
"I mean that if Raymond ever loved any-&#xD;
body besides himself; he loved Margaret, and&#xD;
that he gave her up-nay, more, he forced her&#xD;
to engage herself to a man whom she detests-&#xD;
that he might be free to devote himself to my&#xD;
fortune."&#xD;
"Ermine, I am astonished at you! It is in-&#xD;
comprehensible to me that you should let Mar-&#xD;
garet's absurd complaints weigh with you for&#xD;
a moment. There is not one word of truth in&#xD;
what she asserts concerning Raymond. 1&#xD;
know lids. With regard to Mr. Sexton, no&#xD;
doubt she made you believe that she is a victim&#xD;
to her family, when in reality she is only a&#xD;
Victim to her own mercenary ambition. ii&#xD;
should think that by this time you would ap-&#xD;
preciate her vanity and selfishness sufficiently&#xD;
to rate her sentiments as they deserve."&#xD;
"I think I do," said Ermine, quietly.&#xD;
"And I should think you might knew that&#xD;
I have no possible reason for representing&#xD;
matters in any but their true light."&#xD;
No answer-to this. Ermine was gazing out&#xD;
of the window at the 'blue sky beyond, and she&#xD;
did not withdraw her eyes or utter a sylla-&#xD;
ble.&#xD;

&#xD;
"While I am on this subject," Mrs. Erie&#xD;
continued, a little sharply, "I must say a few&#xD;
words concerning the occurrence of last night.&#xD;
In the first place, may I ask for an explana-&#xD;
tion of your fainting? Raymond, of course,&#xD;
gave none."&#xD;
"There is very little to give, mamma. I&#xD;
was excited, and fainted from the reaction-&#xD;
that is all."&#xD;
"What excited you!"&#xD;
"The music first, I presume, and my con-&#xD;
versation with Raymond afterward."&#xD;
"And may I beg to know the subject of a&#xD;
conversation which took you down to the Bat-&#xD;
tery at eleven o'clock at night?"&#xD;
"Certainly, if you feel any interest in it."&#xD;
Then she recounted substantially what she had&#xD;
told Madelon, all of which, by the same token,&#xD;
Mrs. Erle had heard before, adding when she&#xD;
concluded, "I am glad to tell you this, mamma,&#xD;
because I am anxious that there should be an&#xD;
end of all expectations that Raymond and I&#xD;
should ever marry. You may believe me when&#xD;
I say that there are no possible circumstances&#xD;
which could bring such a thing to pass.~~&#xD;
"However sorry I may be to hear this, and&#xD;
on your account I am sorry," said Mrs. ErIe&#xD;
-with dignity, "I must beg to correct you on&#xD;
one point. You speak as if there had been&#xD;
some plot or plan to marry you to Raymond.&#xD;
I owe it to myself and to my husband to de-&#xD;
clare that we have never done more than wish&#xD;
to see you established in life under the protec-&#xD;
tion of a man who, notwithstanding the inter-&#xD;
ested motives which you impute to him, is suf-&#xD;
ficiently attached to you to bear with your pe-&#xD;
culiar and most trying disposition. That we&#xD;
ever formed this wish, you owe to yourself; and&#xD;
the heartless manner in which you have flirted&#xD;
-with him."&#xD;
"Flirted with him - with Raymond I&#xD;
Mamma, how can you say such a thing, when&#xD;
you-you alone-have always thrown us to-&#xD;
gether?"&#xD;
"Did I throw you together last night?"&#xD;
asked Mrs. Erie. "You know my rules-you&#xD;
know how much lam opposed to any thinglike&#xD;
the f~st manners of the day-yet you wander&#xD;
off itt midnight with Raymond, and finally&#xD;
make your appearance, before half a dozen&#xD;
people, in his arms."&#xD;
"Mamma!" The poor, much-tried blood&#xD;
mounted in a torrent over neck and face.&#xD;
"Consider for a moment-how could I help&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Not understanding the eccentricities of a&#xD;
sensitive temperament, that is mor~than I can&#xD;
answer," said Mrs. Erie, coldly. "if it was&#xD;
necessary for you to faint after the concert, it&#xD;
was at least not necessary that you should&#xD;
have gone down to the Battery to accomplish&#xD;
it. I confess that I am losing patience with&#xD;
your fancies and caprices, Ermine," she went&#xD;
on more sternly; "and, since you seem to have&#xD;
no regard for what people will say ofjour con-&#xD;
duct, I must endeavor to have some for you.&#xD;
If you were engaged to Raymond, the gossips&#xD;
might hold their tongues. Since you nrc not&#xD;
engaged to him, I can scarcely imagine how se-&#xD;
vere the strictures will be on you; and, natu-&#xD;
rally, also, on me'&#xD;
Ermine was silent. She knew from long&#xD;
experience that there was nothing to be said&#xD;
when her mother took this tqne. Justification&#xD;
was useless-still more useless any thing like&#xD;
softening or appeal.&#xD;
"I know perfectly well where your spirit&#xD;
of rebellion has been learned," Mrs. Erle went&#xD;
onin thesam e hard, passionless voice. "Your&#xD;
guardian has always encouraged you in defy-&#xD;
ing my wishes, and you think that you will&#xD;
soon be the legal mistress of your own actions.&#xD;
But none the less, one thing is certain-so&#xD;
long as you ~'emain under my control, so long&#xD;
I shall insist upon your keeping within the&#xD;
bonds of decorum. I shoi~ld never have al-&#xD;
lowed your flirtation with Raymoi~d to go to&#xD;
the shameful length it has done, if I had not&#xD;
supposed that you meant to marry him. I-Jay-&#xD;
ing had this warning, I shall certainly not&#xD;
allow yogi to enter upon another, as you seem&#xD;
disposed to do."&#xD;
Still silence. Sometimes-often, in fact-&#xD;
the only hope of restraining a torrent is to&#xD;
keep the1~ood-gates resolutely shut. What Er-&#xD;
mine would have said if she had enclosed her&#xD;
lips for the passage of even one word, there is&#xD;
no telling. It was not because she did not&#xD;
feel, that she was silent. On the contrary,&#xD;
burning indignation strove for expression, side&#xD;
by side with that sickening sense of being&#xD;
wholly misjudged and cruelly misunderstood,&#xD;
than which earth has no pang more poignant.&#xD;
But she was resolutely silent. What good&#xD;
would it do to speak? She had learned from&#xD;
long and bitter experience thatcher mother and&#xD;
herself were like two jarring chords in music,-&#xD;
never by any chance giving forth a note in uni-&#xD;
son. This realization had weilnigh turned her&#xD;
child's heart to gall, and it had hardened her&#xD;
&#xD;
face now into something of a statue's white,&#xD;
steadfast immobility.&#xD;
"Understand this," said Mrs. Erie, raising&#xD;
her voice not more than a shade of a semitone,&#xD;
but still enough to mark how keenly she was&#xD;
provoked by the reticence which met her like&#xD;
a granite wall, "I desire to hear no more of&#xD;
your romantic, childish nonsense about Alan&#xD;
ErIe, and I expressly forbid your appearance in&#xD;
public with him, or taking a~ rides or drives&#xD;
of the kind which he proposed this morning.&#xD;
YQu have been already sufficiently talked&#xD;
about; and it is my duty to conduct you, since&#xD;
you do not seem capable of conducting your-&#xD;
self." A pause-then, sharply: "Do you hear&#xD;
me, Ermine?"&#xD;
"I hesr you, mamma."&#xD;
"Do you intend to obey me?"&#xD;
"Is that question necessary, mamma?&#xD;
Have I ever disobeyed you when you explicitly&#xD;
~tated your wishes?"&#xD;
"Your conduct is indeed most exemplary,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Erie, bitterly. "You obey my&#xD;
-wishes in the letter, and make it the business&#xD;
of your life to violate them in the spirit. My&#xD;
duty is none the less my duty, however, and I&#xD;
am determined to give no further sanction to an&#xD;
intimacy which has already done you nothing&#xD;
but harm."&#xD;
She uttered the last words in a tone of de-&#xD;
cision which left no room for demur, if Er-&#xD;
mine had been ineilned to make any. But the&#xD;
girl received this sentence with the same pas-&#xD;
sive calm which had characterized her manner&#xD;
all along; and, after waiting for a moment for -&#xD;
the rejoinder which did not come, Mrs. Erie rose 4&#xD;
majestically and swept from the room.&#xD;
Ermine remained motionless - changing&#xD;
neither feature nor expression-for some time&#xD;
after the door had closed on -her mother's soft I&#xD;
draperies. Then something like a shiver of&#xD;
passion seemed suddenly to pass over and shake I&#xD;
her from head to foot.&#xD;
"I comprehend it perfectly," she said, half-&#xD;
aloud. "It is my punishment for rejecting&#xD;
Raymond. Ohif they tried to make mc hate a&#xD;
him, could they do it any better?"       a&#xD;
She rose from her seat restlessly and paced v&#xD;
the floor for a minute. It seemed so hard, a&#xD;
so cruel! She had longed for Alan with such f&#xD;
heart-sick longing, and~now that he had come, h&#xD;
she was not allowed to be happy for one day. g&#xD;
Even her intercourse with him-that joyous C&#xD;
freedom of manner which it had been so much o&#xD;
pleasure to indulge-was placed under a con- ri&#xD;
&#xD;
strain by this new talk of flirtation and love&#xD;
and marriage. One of her old floods of child-&#xD;
ish grief came over the poor girl-poor, though&#xD;
an heiress-as, throwing herself upon her&#xD;
bed, she buried her face in her hands, sobbing&#xD;
bitterly.&#xD;
"0 Alan, dear Alan, if I were only a child,&#xD;
so that you could come and comfort me!" she&#xD;
said. "It seems as if my heart will break.&#xD;
How they all are banded against me-mamma&#xD;
because I cannot obey her wishes; Margaret,&#xD;
because I have stood between Raymond and&#xD;
herself; Madelon, because she is selfishly bent&#xD;
on her own fortune. If ever there comes to&#xD;
me a time of desperate strait or extremity, may -&#xD;
God help mc, for I cannot count upon one&#xD;
friend among them all!"&#xD;
Looking back afterward, Ermine remem-&#xD;
bered this thought, but it is good to believe&#xD;
and to trust that, in any time of desperate&#xD;
"strait or extremity," God does help those for&#xD;
whom mortal help is not.&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII. -&#xD;
THE ENCHANTED LAND.&#xD;
ERMINE spent the entire morning and the&#xD;
whole long afternoon in her own room. Of&#xD;
course, she could have comeforth if she had&#xD;
chosen-since Mrs. Erie's purpose had been&#xD;
accomplished when she ended that tender inter-&#xD;
view with Alan-but it may have been that&#xD;
the girl was glad enough of the rest which is&#xD;
doubly sweet after combat or excitement. At&#xD;
ill events, she did not appear at dinner, and it&#xD;
was only when twilight was trembling softly&#xD;
wer the earth that she came down-stairs. The&#xD;
arge, cool, fragrant house was wholly empty,&#xD;
md as silent as that enchanted palace o~m which&#xD;
berlinn laid hiaspell. Ermine wandered through&#xD;
dl the rooms, finding no trace of huml~ii pres-&#xD;
nec anywhere. The beauty of the dying May&#xD;
lay seemed to have tempted all Charleston&#xD;
broad and every member of the household&#xD;
ave herself had caught the infection. She -&#xD;
ras all alone-alone to do what see pleased,&#xD;
nd go where she pleased, to pace back and&#xD;
orth, and wander hem~e and there, in luxurious&#xD;
Illness of motion. She strolled into the&#xD;
arden and decked herself with rQses, like a&#xD;
~reek divinity; then came back and sat in the&#xD;
pen window with "Te~yson" in her lap, not&#xD;
ending save by snatches, and repeating to her-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC8067-00000024"/>&#xD;
48                        EBB-TIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
self; whenever her eye rested on the fair scene&#xD;
beyond, the exquisite "Move eastward, happy&#xD;
earth." If she and Tennyson had had the&#xD;
sunset all to themselves, this would have been&#xD;
vety pleasant; but, unfortunately, there were&#xD;
numbers of other people privileged to enjoy&#xD;
the hour, people riding, driving, sauntering&#xD;
past, bowing tv the pretty face framed in the&#xD;
window and necessitating a bow in return. It&#xD;
seemed(to Ermine that everybody whom she&#xD;
knew went by-everybody except the one for&#xD;
whom her eyes were watching and her heart&#xD;
longing. Even Major Hastings rode past, and&#xD;
uncovered his handsome head-wondering a&#xD;
good deal at the stiff inclination which was all&#xD;
he received in acknowledgment. It was just&#xD;
after this that Ermine rOse. "It is a bore to&#xD;
sit in the wiiidow and be bowed at," she said,&#xD;
pettishly; and then she sauntered away toward&#xD;
the back drawing-room. Twilight, in which it&#xD;
was impossible to read-&#xD;
"Labor's brief armistice!&#xD;
Best, loveliest interlude of dark end liflit&#xD;
had already gathered here; so, putting down&#xD;
her volume, she 'went to the piano, lifted its&#xD;
lid, and, slowly touching "the beautiful 'cold&#xD;
keys," which gave back lovingly their rich&#xD;
tones under her hands, began to play the mar-&#xD;
vellous "Moonlight Sonata."&#xD;
She played it once-twice-thrice-not so&#xD;
much because she loved the repetition of its&#xD;
melody, as because it chanced to suit her mood,&#xD;
and the tender, passionate chords made an&#xD;
accompaniment to her thoughts, which never&#xD;
flowed so smoothly, never so sweetly, as to the&#xD;
sound of music. She was well on in the third&#xD;
repetition, playing, as it were, unconsciously,&#xD;
with her eyes turned on a glimpse of the&#xD;
"fringes of the faded eve," seen through a vine-&#xD;
draped window near by, and her mind far&#xD;
away, when the sound of a distant footstep&#xD;
caught her ear. Instantly the white hands&#xD;
stopped short on the ivory keys, she turned,,&#xD;
her head-the breath suspended on her parted&#xD;
lips-and listened.&#xD;
After a moment, her listening was re-&#xD;
warded. Footsteps crossed the hall, crossed&#xD;
the front drawing-room, came toward her re-&#xD;
treat, ,the silken curtains of the arch were&#xD;
pushed aside, and in the opening there ap-&#xD;
peared-a dog literally as large as a pony, a&#xD;
magnificent creature all tawny gold, dashed&#xD;
with black, whose hair, soft as silk, curled&#xD;
round him in every direction, and whose large,&#xD;
&#xD;
bright eyes were full of indescribable beauty&#xD;
and expression. This formidable visitor en-&#xD;
tered with the stately tread of a lion, his plumy&#xD;
tail drooping, his superb head erect, his whole&#xD;
face-where gentleness and strength were so&#xD;
marvelously mingled-fullof vivid expectation.&#xD;
At sight of him, Ermine made one spring from&#xD;
her music-stool.&#xD;
"Nix!" she ci~ied, joyfully. "Ohmy dear,&#xD;
dear old fellow, is it you?"&#xD;
Nix gave one short, hoarse bark of de-&#xD;
lighted recognition, and, to attest that it was&#xD;
indeed he, then rushed full at her, wagging his&#xD;
tail like an insane dog, and fairly knocking her&#xD;
into a convenient chair with the weight of the&#xD;
two monstrous paws which went at once to her&#xD;
shoulders, while her hands clasped eagerly&#xD;
round the silken mane that covered his im-&#xD;
mense throat. It was an affecting embrace,&#xD;
only Ermine, being much the smaller, had much&#xD;
the worst of it. She was indeed in rapid course&#xD;
of suffocation, and Nix's large, red tongue was&#xD;
licking her face with unmolested delight, when&#xD;
fortunately a tall gentleman stepped from be-&#xD;
hind the arch and came to the rescue.&#xD;
"Nix! you scamp 1-have done! " he&#xD;
cried in a tone which Nix at once obeyed by&#xD;
dropping on all-fours and proceeding to make&#xD;
a comma, of himself.-" Ermine, are you not&#xD;
almost smothered? The rascal is overpower-&#xD;
ingly affectionate if you let him be !-No, sir--&#xD;

"Hew could I help knowing, with her face&#xD;

"I'm not blushing about anybody," said&#xD;
Ermine, indignantly. "If lam a little flushed,&#xD;

"Oh I It is owing to the heat and to&#xD;
Nix-is ~t? Well I will accept the explana-&#xD;

under discussion.. What did ma tanle say&#xD;

Ermine moved restlessly under the half-&#xD;
laughing but determined eyes, shrugged her&#xD;
shoulders, and finally said petulantly," Noth-&#xD;
ing that you will care to hear."&#xD;
"But I do care to hear," said he, leaning&#xD;
forward again. "Ermine, don't tantalize so-&#xD;
what was it?" A pause-then impatiently:&#xD;
"Good :Ueavens~ child! why should you hesi-&#xD;
tate? Do you suppose I care for an~ thing she&#xD;
might say? Of course the longer you wait,&#xD;
the more terrible I shall think it, and, if you&#xD;
don't mind, you will make an anti-climax of it&#xD;
at last."              -&#xD;
" Who cams about an aitti-climax? I don't&#xD;
mean to tell you atall."&#xD;
"Then I ~baU simply have to guess until I&#xD;
find out. Of course, it must have been some-&#xD;
&#xD;
thing about you, too, or you would not be so&#xD;
reluctant to repeat it. Eureka! I have it: she&#xD;
said I meant to make love to you for your for-&#xD;
tune!"&#xD;
"She never even hinted such a thing!"&#xD;
cried Ermine-and how hotly the blood rushed&#xD;
over neck and brow again.&#xD;
"Then what was it, you absurd little&#xD;
Sphinx? If you don't tell me, I will set Nix on&#xD;
you, and let him do his worst."&#xD;
"Alan," said she, tragically~ "I can't tell&#xD;
you. I cried over it desperately, but I am sure&#xD;
you would only laugh."&#xD;
"I should never laugh at any thing you&#xD;
thought worth crying over, you may be sure of&#xD;
that!"&#xD;
"Well then-for one thing, mamma says I&#xD;
must not ride with you any more.~~&#xD;
She thought this would be a terrible blow,&#xD;
and she was rather disappointed when Alan's&#xD;
only comment was a cool-&#xD;
"Indeed!"&#xD;
"Nor walk with you, either."&#xD;
"Nor talk with me, I presume?"&#xD;
"Nothing was said abouttalking, but I don't&#xD;
think we shall be able to do much of it, for she&#xD;
also says-"&#xD;
Here the-voice stopped short again, in em-&#xD;
barrassed silence. Captain ErIe was still&#xD;
leaning forward, absently caressing his mus-&#xD;
tache with one sunburnt hand, while his eyes&#xD;
followed every change of the mobile face be-&#xD;
fore him. "Well, what is it she also says?"&#xD;
he asked, dryly, as Ermine paused.&#xD;
"She says that I flirted with Raymond,"&#xD;
cried Ermine, with a burst of determined, in-&#xD;
dignation, "and that-and that I shall not flirt&#xD;
with you too!"&#xD;
"How good of her to take such carb of&#xD;
me!" said he, ironically. "But if ~ou have&#xD;
a fancy for flirting, Ermine-an amusement&#xD;
which, by-the-way, I took to be Madelon's and&#xD;
Margaret's monopoly-I hope you won't hesi-&#xD;
tate to make use of me."&#xD;
"I knew you would laugh," said Ermine,&#xD;
struggling with an inclination to tears, "and&#xD;
I really think it is very-very unkind of&#xD;
"lf I laugh, it is because I should like&#xD;
amazingly to do something else; and that be-&#xD;
ing impossible, I must find a vent for my feel-&#xD;
ings some other way," said he. "In short, Er-&#xD;
mine, the upshot of the whole matter is, that&#xD;
you and I are to be kept from seeing any&#xD;
thing whatever of each other,"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes," said Ermine, in a lugubrious tone,&#xD;
U ~ think that is 'in"&#xD;
"And do you mean to submit to it?"&#xD;
"How can I help submitting to it, Alan?&#xD;
You don't know "-once more a burning blush&#xD;
spread over her face-" you can't tell what&#xD;
things have been said to me."&#xD;
"Yes, I can!" said he, almost fiercely;&#xD;
and, by Heaven! I wish I had the people,&#xD;
who said them, hero this minute, Ermine! "-.&#xD;
his voice changed and softened so suddenly&#xD;
that she fairly started-" will you go and play&#xD;
some for me? I must think a minute, and your&#xD;
music may help me to a decision."&#xD;
"What do you want to think about?"&#xD;
asked she, in surprise.&#xD;
"I w~nt to think how I can best defeat&#xD;
the kind intentions of these dear friends of&#xD;
yours," answered he, bitterly. "I am not likely&#xD;
to sit down quietly and let them have their&#xD;
way. If I had to walk over a dozen moth-&#xD;
ers, I would do it without a thought, so I won&#xD;
my way to you."&#xD;
"It is hard," said Ermine, while her sensi-&#xD;
tive lip quivered slightly. "You have been&#xD;
away so long; and now that you are at&#xD;
home-"&#xD;
"Now that I am at home, I'll have what I&#xD;
want-that is, your society-if I have to fight&#xD;
for it!"&#xD;
"I'm not worth fighting for, Alan."&#xD;
"Let me be judge of that, an't please you!&#xD;
Now go and play for me."&#xD;
"What shall I play?" asked the obedient&#xD;
slave of this marine ~elim I'acha.&#xD;
"Anything you please. Didn't I hear the&#xD;
'Moonlight Sonata' as I came in? Play that."&#xD;
She went to the piano, and, sitting down,&#xD;
began the beautiful strains for the fourth time.&#xD;
If any one had chanced to glance in just then,&#xD;
the dusk room with the twilight gathering in&#xD;
its deeper corners, and the dying Southern&#xD;
day, outside, would have made a picture worth&#xD;
remembering. Through the soft gloaming the&#xD;
white statues-pedestal~throned......looked al-&#xD;
most eerie in their cold, motionless grace; one&#xD;
large, gleaming mirror caught the orange sun-&#xD;
set, and held it, as it were, imprisoned in its&#xD;
depths; through the vine-draped western win-&#xD;
dow a flush of rosy light fell over Nix, as he&#xD;
lay in leonine grandeur on the velvet carpet, ~&#xD;
prone at his master's feet, while of this master s&#xD;
himself; the light only caught the white polish ~&#xD;
of his brow, and the hand that still stroked r&#xD;
absently the long, silken mustache. The I&#xD;
&#xD;
piano was entirely in shade, but its tones--&#xD;
now deep and rich as an organ, now clear as a&#xD;
silver bell-swelled out softly on the flower-&#xD;
scented air, the ' subtle harmonies melting&#xD;
into that composition which had for its in-&#xD;
spiration the sole attachment of the great&#xD;
master's life, and through which there seems&#xD;
quivering, like moonlight on mountain lake, all&#xD;
that is most exquisite, most tender in passion,&#xD;
all that is most apart from and above the love&#xD;
of the senses.&#xD;
"Whom God loveth not, they love not&#xD;
music!" Oh, poor, darkened minds !-poor,&#xD;
dust-steeped souls !-poor, earth-bound spirits!&#xD;
Do they never feel that there are heights-&#xD;
even on earth-forever beyond them? Do&#xD;
they never yearn to soar aloft-were it only&#xD;
for once-into the realm of light and life which&#xD;
music alone can lend to the spirit still bound&#xD;
prison-house o&#xD;
within its            f clay?  "Having&#xD;
ears," do they always "hear not" the echo of&#xD;
those marvellous strains which speak to the&#xD;
soul of man as no other mortal power has ever&#xD;
done, can ever do? Do they never long for&#xD;
one moment in the enchanted palace of har-&#xD;
mony and tone, the glowing world of feeling&#xD;
and sensation, shut from their obtuse faculties&#xD;
forever? Do they never lift their heavy eyes&#xD;
toward the' golden cloud-heights far beyond&#xD;
them, and wistfully sigh for one faint glimmer&#xD;
of the influence which eludes all echo in the&#xD;
language of earth, because in it is more of&#xD;
heaven than in any oth moral left us of&#xD;
the time when angels wab~~. ~ with the first man,&#xD;
and when the two in paradise may have&#xD;
hearkened in the purple dawn and rosy twi-&#xD;
light to the silver harmonies of the choirs of&#xD;
heaven?"&#xD;
When the last echoes of the sonata died&#xD;
away, the twilight had deepened like a trans.&#xD;
parent veil through which there still lingered&#xD;
the last kiss that the sun had left to sweeten&#xD;
his brief parting from the fair, entrancing&#xD;
?arth. A soft, wistful sigh came to Ermine~s&#xD;
?ar, as the last chord sounded under her lin-&#xD;
;ering touch. Then there was silence.&#xD;
"Alan," she said after a while, gently,&#xD;
'Alan-has the music put you to sleep?"&#xD;
For answer Alan rose and, crossed the room&#xD;
o her side. That electric current of sympathy&#xD;
rhich is one of the strangest things about our&#xD;
range organism~whetherphysical or mental,&#xD;
rho can say?-made her conscious of some&#xD;
cood on which her question had jarred, and&#xD;
:ept her from saying any thing more, 'even&#xD;

&#xD;
when the tall figure came and stood over her,&#xD;
leaning slightly against the carved instrument.&#xD;
Nix raisedhis great head lazily, and looked&#xD;
after his master; but he did not feel inclined&#xD;
to move, and the twilight baffled even his keen&#xD;
eyes. He could see nothing more than two&#xD;
shadowy forms-two suggestive outlines of&#xD;
manhood and womanhood - at the piano,&#xD;
though his quick ear caught the murmur of a&#xD;
low, well-known voice. He listened for a me.&#xD;
ment, but the subject under discussion did not&#xD;
interest him. He yawned, dropped his mas-&#xD;
sive head again, and dreamed probably of the&#xD;
.last bone he had buried, while Captain Erle&#xD;
was saying:&#xD;
"To sleep, indeed! Could such music put&#xD;
anybody but Nix to sleep? You never played&#xD;
better in your life. I wonder what magic en-&#xD;
tered into your fingers, you little white witch!&#xD;
I thought of the 'Lorely,' and all the songs of&#xD;
the sirens. If I did not go to sleep, I dreamed&#xD;
a dream better than Tennyson's 'Dream of&#xD;
Fair Women '-for mine was only of one fairl&#xD;
woman. Shall I tell it to you?"&#xD;
"Yes," answered the low voice, like music&#xD;
out of the fragrant ~iusk. "Only Iwarn youthat&#xD;
I shall expect something very exquisite, since&#xD;
it was inspired by the 'Moonlight Sonata."'&#xD;
"I think it was very exquisite-at least it&#xD;
seemed so to inc. On second thoughts, how-&#xD;
ever, I won't tell it to you-that is, not just&#xD;
yet. We have business to settle first, you&#xD;
know. I was to find a way out of our dilem-&#xD;
ma, was Inot?"&#xD;
"Of course you were. Didn't you send&#xD;
me to the piano as an excuse to think? And&#xD;
then you tell me that you only dreamed."&#xD;
"Sometimes our best thoughts come from&#xD;
dreams, mignonne. God only knows where&#xD;
mine has come from; but I have it, and I&#xD;
mean to hold it fast. Little one, look at me!"&#xD;
"How can I look at you, Alan, when it is&#xD;
so dark?"&#xD;
"Why, I see you perfectly-or is it be-&#xD;
cause I see you always-absent as well as&#xD;
near? I am inclined to think that your best&#xD;
portrait will be found on my heart, after I am&#xD;
dead, Ermine."&#xD;
"Like 'Calais' on that of your Queen&#xD;
Mary? What a fanciful idea, Alan!"&#xD;
"Love teaches us fanciful ideas. Who&#xD;
was it said that once in his life every man is a&#xD;
poet? There~ is more truth in that than the&#xD;
world wots. ~Little one, gentle one, sweetest&#xD;
one of all the earth, suppose I tell you that&#xD;
&#xD;
there is but one way out of the difficulties&#xD;
which have been placed around us ?-suppose&#xD;
I ask you if you love me well enough to place&#xD;
your hand in mine and let me claim you as my&#xD;
own before all the world?"&#xD;
"Alan!"&#xD;
What a sudden, low cry it was--smiting'&#xD;
almost painfully on the yielding air, and mak-&#xD;
ing Nix raise his head with a deep, bass growl [&#xD;
It reminded Alan of the cry which she had&#xD;
given when he bade her good-by to go upon&#xD;
his first long voyage. Then he had taken her&#xD;
in his arms and comforted her with softest&#xD;
kisses. Now he only knelt (not as a supplant,&#xD;
but simply to placehimself on a level with her),&#xD;
and, bending his head, laid his lips on the tw~&#xD;
little hands that lay like fragments of rare&#xD;
statuary in her lap.&#xD;
"Ermine," he said-and the sweet syllables&#xD;
of her name had never sounded so sweet be-&#xD;
fore-" have I startled you? Child, don't you&#xD;
see how it has been? I did not mean to ask&#xD;
you to marry me, because I had no mind to be&#xD;
branded as a fortune-hunter, and I thought you&#xD;
would in time love some man who might be&#xD;
able to match you in worldly advantages. But&#xD;
after all, this is cowardice. Shall I make no&#xD;
effort to win the prize and pearl of my life, be-&#xD;
cause people for whom I care nothing may&#xD;
call me mercenary? If I had feared that yow&#xD;
might think so, I should have been silent for.&#xD;
ever But I know better than that. Even if&#xD;
you cannot give yourself to me so that no&#xD;
human power can ever come between us again,&#xD;
I know you will do me the justice to believe&amp;amp;&#xD;
that I love you so well, so dearly, that every&#xD;
other gift of earth seems worse than useless~&#xD;
without you!"&#xD;
"0 Alan-Alan!"&#xD;
A different cry, this time-a soft, glad utter-&#xD;
ance of happiness, so pure, so tender, that the&#xD;
angels of God might have looked on and blessed&#xD;
it with a smile!&#xD;
"Will you come to me, my Ermine, my&#xD;
heart's darling?" asked the low voice, infi.&#xD;
nitely gentle in its cadence. "If you say' Yes,'&#xD;
nobody in the world shall ever harm or trouble&#xD;
my spotless lily again!"&#xD;
She looked up at him with something al-&#xD;
most infantine in the sweet, pathetic eyes&#xD;
shining out of her white face in the soft gloom.&#xD;
"Do you really want m~, Alan?"&#xD;
"Has there ever been a day or an hour&#xD;
when I did not want you, my darling, my be-&#xD;
loved?&#xD;
&#xD;
"You are sure that it is not only because&#xD;
you are sorry for me, as you were sorry once&#xD;
long ago?"&#xD;
"I am very, very sure, my pet. Ah, Er-&#xD;
m~c" (with a thrill of passion), "don't hold&#xD;
back like a pale shadow, and tempt me to take&#xD;
you whether you will or no! Come to me&#xD;
say that you are mine!"&#xD;
Then the hands which he had kissed, but,&#xD;
like a chivalric gentleman, left otherwise un-&#xD;
touched, came to him with a quaint min-&#xD;
gling of child.like simplicity and womanly dig-&#xD;
nity.&#xD;
"Here I am, Alan," said the tender, loyal&#xD;
voice. "Take me if you choose: I am yours."&#xD;
Then he took her-safe into his arms, close&#xD;
to his faithful heart. In the fragrant May&#xD;
gloaming, they forgot the past or the future,&#xD;
and, living only in the magic present, passed,&#xD;
like happy childrenthrough the gates of Fancy&#xD;
into that fair, enchanted land where Love&#xD;
dwells forever as an immortal.&#xD;
So they stood, and so they spoke not, for&#xD;
many minutes. Then Ermine lifted her face-&#xD;
her soft tones breaking on the air with a ca-&#xD;
dence like that passionate thrill which we&#xD;
catch in the words of the sweet Ital~n maiden&#xD;
who had "no cunning to be strange.'&#xD;
"Alan dear, was this your dreaiy(?"&#xD;
The last, faint flush of sunse~how loath&#xD;
the day is to give place to night,~Kin the sweet&#xD;
May-time-fell over the shadowy picture which&#xD;
they made, standing together-the delicate,&#xD;
white-robed woman clasped close in the em-&#xD;
brace of her stately lover, her l~ead thrown&#xD;
back a little, and her face upturned to catch&#xD;
the light in his eyes as she asked her ques-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"You want to know about my dream?"&#xD;
he asked, smiling. "Ahbest-beloved, there is&#xD;
now, as ever, but one fair woman for me."&#xD;
"And she?"&#xD;
He bent and kissed the eager lips passion-&#xD;
nt~ly, before he answered-&#xD;
"She is here."&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
FLOOD-TIDE.&#xD;
a good thing it is to be happy [&#xD;
(IC course it is a pleasant thing-everybody&#xD;
knows that-but I contend that it is also a&#xD;
good thincr; that it warms our hearts, expands&#xD;
&#xD;
our minds, makes us more gentle, more tender,&#xD;
more full of charity to men, more full of love&#xD;
to God! In short, it is to human nature what&#xD;
the blessed sunshine is to the plants of the&#xD;
earth-warming, fructifying, bringing forth&#xD;
fair flowers and sweet fruits even from barren&#xD;
ground, until we are almost tempted to ask&#xD;
why it is that so little of such an influence&#xD;
should be found.in th~world-&#xD;
"Which God created very good,&#xD;
And very mournful we I"&#xD;
Only in this, as in many things else, it is&#xD;
easier to ask than to answer. In this, as in&#xD;
many things else, faith speaks to us of the&#xD;
gracious intentions of a kind Father, and sight&#xD;
shows us the perverse rebellion of disobedient&#xD;
children. We were meant to be happy--&#xD;
every thing goes to prove that-and we have&#xD;
to thank each other chiefly and primarily for&#xD;
the pangs and tears and bitter sufferings&#xD;
which frustrate that intention.&#xD;
Sometimes, however, we are happy-su-&#xD;
premely and wholly happy-in spite of all&#xD;
that can be done by friends or enemies to re-&#xD;
duce us to our normal warfare with Fate.&#xD;
Sometimes the sunshine comes upon us with&#xD;
a rush, and oh, how we bask in it, how we&#xD;
drink deeply of its tropical warmth; and,&#xD;
even *hen the clouds gather again, how we&#xD;
feel that what we have enjoyed once is ours&#xD;
forever! So it was with Ermine now. Born&#xD;
of the South, and in the South, she was&#xD;
Southern in every fibre of her being, and&#xD;
every tissue of her organization. To say this,&#xD;
is to say that she- lived a whole life of sensa-&#xD;
tion where one of colder temperament would&#xD;
have felt scarcely a throb stirring the even&#xD;
current of existence. It was enough to look&#xD;
at her slight, nervous pky8ique, her pale, in-&#xD;
tense face, her dark, unconsciously passionate&#xD;
eyes, to understand that, for once, Disraeli&#xD;
was right when he wrote-"alI is race: there&#xD;
is no other truth," and that the wonderful&#xD;
Dr. Sarona was equally-right when he added-&#xD;
"all is temperament: without understanding&#xD;
it, there is no arriving at truth."&#xD;
Race and temperament had both conspired&#xD;
to make the faithful, tender, passionate creat-&#xD;
ure, at whose feet the flood-tide of perfect&#xD;
happiness flowed now. This story-being&#xD;
simply the story ef her life-has little to do&#xD;
with others, save iii their effect upon this life;&#xD;
therefore it will not pause to tell how the&#xD;
storm of family indignation burst on the heads&#xD;
of the lovers, who had dared to bring their&#xD;
&#xD;
FLOOD-TIDE.&#xD;

&#xD;
tendresse to an open engagement. If either&#xD;
of them had regarded this tempest, it might&#xD;
prove worth while to devote a little space to&#xD;
what was said, by whom, and how, and when,&#xD;
and where. But in truth they did not mind it&#xD;
in the least. The absorbing preoccupation of&#xD;
passion was upon them, and thhy heeded too&#xD;
little, perhaps, the bitter storm around them.&#xD;
No one had a right to say them Nay, and for&#xD;
simple disapproval they cared nothing. The&#xD;
whole course of their love had consisted in&#xD;
braving this disapprovall, until it had assumed&#xD;
the bearing of a settled and unalterable fact-&#xD;
somewhat disagreeable, it is true, and, if pos-&#xD;
sible, to be ignored. They did ignore it. Oh,&#xD;
how easy it is to let any and every untoward&#xD;
circumstance pass by like the wind, when one&#xD;
is happy! When one has an inner refuge of&#xD;
calm, vexations do not ruffle, and even disap-&#xD;
pointments can be borne with sublime philos-&#xD;
ophy! On high moral and social grounds,&#xD;
Mrs. Erie took her position, and absolutely&#xD;
refused her consent to the engagement; but&#xD;
then (as no one knew better than herself) her&#xD;
consent was a mere matter of form, her hus-&#xD;
band's will having denied her even the shadow&#xD;
of authority over her daughter. She often&#xD;
waxed pathetic over this "posthumous in-&#xD;
justice and wrong;" but the probabilities are&#xD;
that the dead St. Amand knew very well&#xD;
what he was about, and that Ermine's life&#xD;
would not have been gladdened by even its&#xD;
one gleam of sunshine if her mother could&#xD;
have prevented it.&#xD;
prevent it, however, she could not-ex~ept&#xD;
thus far. When Alan came, like the thorough-&#xD;
bred gentleman which Nature had made him,&#xD;
to ask her consent to her daughter's engage-&#xD;
ment, she coldly reminded him that her con-&#xD;
sent was not of any importance, since Ermine's&#xD;
self and Ermine's fortune were quite indepen-&#xD;
dent of her control. Said she, with a keen&#xD;
bitterness which he never forgot:&#xD;
"It is to Colonel Vivicux-my daughter's&#xD;
guardian-not to myself, that you should&#xD;
apply. I must refer you, to him, and I can&#xD;
only speak as his mpresentx4ive to a limited&#xD;
extent, when I say that, although I cannot for-&#xD;
bid, I must decline to sanction the engagement&#xD;
into which Mademoiselle St. Amand has seenfit&#xD;
to enter. Apart from my personal regard for&#xD;
yourself, I consider it a very unadvisable and&#xD;
very rn-judged affair. It is my duty, there-&#xD;
fore, to beg that no steps may be taken&#xD;
toward making the engagement public, until&#xD;
&#xD;
Colonel Yivieux's consent has been formally&#xD;
obtained."&#xD;
Answered Captain Erie with unusual but&#xD;
(all things considered) scarcely unnatural kau-&#xD;
teus-: "You may be sure, madame, that your&#xD;
wishes shall be observed-would, indeed, have&#xD;
been observed even if you had not expressed&#xD;
them. Neither Ermine nor myself is anxious&#xD;
to make our engagement public, and I had no&#xD;
intention of doing other then applying to her&#xD;
guardian for his consent. In coming to ask&#xD;
your approval, it seems that I have made a&#xD;
mistake-but I cannot regret it. I recog-&#xD;
nized-I still recognize-a higher than legal&#xD;
right which you possess in your daughter's&#xD;
happiness. Therefore I ventured to ask your&#xD;
sanction on the only way in which this happi.&#xD;
ness can be secured."&#xD;
"My daughter knows my wishes with re-&#xD;
gard to her," said Mrs. Erle, icily. "She does&#xD;
not recognize 'the higher than legal right'&#xD;
of which you are kind enough to speak, and&#xD;
therefore I may be pardoned if I waive it."&#xD;
Alan looked steadily into the handsome&#xD;
face confronting him, and it seemed to his&#xD;
gaze at that moment as if no human counte-&#xD;
nance could possibly have been more repulsive&#xD;
or more unlovely.&#xD;
"Madame," he said, "I do not need for&#xD;
you to tell me how unworthy you consider me&#xD;
of your daughter-and," he added, half&#xD;
proudly, "I know as well as you do that I am&#xD;
unworthy of her. But, one thing, at least, I&#xD;
thank God that I can give her in abundant&#xD;
measure-that is, love."&#xD;
It is likely that Mrs. Erle felt the rebuke&#xD;
as keenly as he meant that she should. Yet&#xD;
no outward sign betrayed this fact, save only&#xD;
the stinging shaft which she sent back in&#xD;
return.&#xD;
"As I have already remarked, Captain&#xD;
Erie, the onerous responsibility of the guar-&#xD;
dianship of Ermine does not' rest in my hands;&#xD;
but I think it right to warn you that Colonel&#xD;
Vivicux is an exceedingly practical person,&#xD;
andthat he may not think the boundless love&#xD;
which you are good enough to offer an exact&#xD;
equivalent for the 'material advantages' which&#xD;
you would gain by an alliance with his ward."&#xD;
Can anybody offer an insult as neatly and&#xD;
effectually as a woman of the world, when she&#xD;
chooses to try? It is really almost edifying to&#xD;
mark with what perfect &amp;amp;rt she knows how,&#xD;
and when, and where, to plant a sting which&#xD;
cannot be extracted by any degree of mortal&#xD;
&#xD;
skill. In the present instance, Alan had sensi&#xD;
enough to restrain himself, and not to own, ix&#xD;
vulgar parlance, that the cap fitted, by putting&#xD;
it on. When he could speak-which was noi&#xD;
by any means immediately-he answered&#xD;
coldly, but quietly enough:&#xD;
"Allow me to tell you, madame-what]&#xD;
shall tell Colonel Vivicux, when I have the&#xD;
pleasure of seeing him-tlxnt, in asking Ermine&#xD;
to marry me, I do not propose that all the&#xD;
'material advantages' shall be on her side.&#xD;
That she is unfortunately rich, I know; but-&#xD;
although I am at present a poor mau-.--I, too,&#xD;
have sanguine hopes of wealth. According to&#xD;
my present expectations (by detailing which I&#xD;
could not hope to interest you), I am sure that&#xD;
my next voyage will go far to make mc inde-&#xD;
pendent of any fortune-be it large or small-&#xD;
which Ermine may possess."&#xD;
"In other words, you propose that my&#xD;
daughter shall waste the best years of her&#xD;
youth in an aimless engagement, while you-&#xD;
excuse me if the truth sounds rude 1-are pur.&#xD;
suing some visionaryseheme of wealth on the&#xD;
other side of the globe?"&#xD;
"Not visionary, if you will excuse me, in&#xD;
turn. I cannot think that details of maritime&#xD;
enterprise could be interesting, or even intelh.&#xD;
gible to a lady, or I should endeavor to prove~&#xD;
to you-as I hope to prove to Colonel Yivieux&#xD;
-that my expectations rest on a very sure&#xD;
bafis. At all events, you may be sure that I&#xD;
shall not press the question of marriage on&#xD;
Ermine, until I can offer her something besides&#xD;
an empty name, and the love which-es you&#xD;
are kind enough to remind me-contrasts but&#xD;
poorly with the wealth which she will bring to&#xD;
her husband."&#xD;
With this assurance-spoken in a tone&#xD;
which it was impossible to doubt-Mrs. Erle&#xD;
was certainly justified in thinking that she had&#xD;
gained an advantage which might prove of&#xD;
very solid importance and benefit. After this,&#xD;
she felt that it was wisest to succumb a little&#xD;
to the inevitable, to com$eal a slight acknowl-&#xD;
edgment of the engagement, to patch up a&#xD;
truce, with a perfect understanding on both&#xD;
sides of it~ hollowness.&#xD;
But harder evdn to bear than the lady's&#xD;
refined sarcasm were the significant comments&#xD;
of Mr. Erie and Raymond. A man cannot well&#xD;
knock another man down, for smiling in very&#xD;
cynical fashion and saying, "My dear fellow,&#xD;
you certainly have wonderful luck-allow me&#xD;
to congratulate you! "-but he can at least&#xD;
&#xD;
feel very much inclined to do so. In truth,&#xD;
nothing tried Alan'spatience more sorely than&#xD;
the consciousness that his uncle and brother&#xD;
measured him by their own standard-as&#xD;
I everybody more or less does in this world-&#xD;
and considered simply that he had been more&#xD;
lucky or more far-seeing than themselves.&#xD;
"Upon my word, my dear boy," said his&#xD;
uncle, smiling benignly, "your quixotism in&#xD;
resigning your mother's fortune is very prettily&#xD;
rewarded-quite like a moral story, indeed.&#xD;
Having no particular interest in Ermine's&#xD;
heiress.ship, I don't know the exact figure of&#xD;
her fortune; but I thjnk I am justified in&#xD;
assuring you that it will reach a very handsome&#xD;
amount-very handsome indeed! I take it&#xD;
for granted that you will retire from the-nh.-&#xD;
sea immediately."&#xD;
"On the contrary, sir, I expect to go to&#xD;
sea again within a month," answered Alan,&#xD;
quite brusquely.&#xD;
He was too proud and too worldly-wise both,&#xD;
to attempt any disclaimer of interested mo-&#xD;
tives to men like these. There are people in the&#xD;
world who arc honestly incredulous of any thing&#xD;
more than what they find in themselves. These&#xD;
people yield you a sort of reluctant admiration&#xD;
while they think you a mercenary scoundrel;&#xD;
but, if you disclaim the scoundrelism or the&#xD;
mercenary intentions, they change their minds&#xD;
only just sufficiently to consider you a hypo-&#xD;
crite. All the eloquence of all the angels,&#xD;
archangels, thrones, nominations, and powers,&#xD;
could not have convinced a singIe-~agniber of&#xD;
the Erie family that Alan sought Ermine sim-&#xD;
ply for herself and the pure, s~eet womanhood&#xD;
which God had given her. So, the young sailor&#xD;
held his peace, and wasted not even a word&#xD;
on them. The misconception hurt him, of&#xD;
course-does misconception ever no~ hurt ?-&#xD;
but be was enough of a philosopher to take it&#xD;
for what it was worth. Or, no-he was not&#xD;
enough a phfl~~sopher to do that. He thought&#xD;
he did, but h~was mistaken. If ha had rated&#xD;
it at its true value, he would never have let it&#xD;
influence him even to the degree of making&#xD;
the resolve which he had opposed to Mrs. Erle's&#xD;
barbed arrows. If be had done what was&#xD;
wise, he would have taken the gift which For.&#xD;
tune had bestowed; he would have regarded&#xD;
the tender, loving, human heart mere than the&#xD;
dross of earth which went with it; he would&#xD;
have sacrificed his own pride to secure the&#xD;
happiness of the woman ho had trusted all&#xD;
to him. But l~e did not is e let his&#xD;

&#xD;
opportunity pass, and Fate seldom offers twice&#xD;
a chance which has been once neglected.&#xD;
There are few of us who have not learned from&#xD;
bitter experience that-&#xD;
"We must take the current when it serves,&#xD;
Or lose our ventures."&#xD;
Delay a day, delay even an hour, let the ebb&#xD;
once come, and not even Shakespeare ever said&#xD;
a truer truth than that the voyage of our lives&#xD;
will be for aye&#xD;
"Bound In shallows and In miseries."&#xD;
But the ebb had not come in the lives of&#xD;
the two of whom this story speaks. Just&#xD;
now that "tide in the affairs of men, which,&#xD;
taken at the flood, leads on to fortune," rolled&#xD;
its bright waves to their feet. If they had&#xD;
embarked-Ah, well! let the future tell its&#xD;
own story. We deal simply with the present.&#xD;
And how bright the present was! Not&#xD;
even Romeo and Juliet telling over the poetry&#xD;
of their immortal love, "in the land where&#xD;
love most lovely seems," were ever more rapt&#xD;
in golden enchantment than these two, in the&#xD;
spring-tide of that happiness like unto no&#xD;
other happiness of earth. Any one who has&#xD;
ever known any thing of the sensitive, artistic&#xD;
temperament-the temperament so closely&#xD;
allied to genius that we can scarcely dissociate&#xD;
one from the other-may perhaps imagine (for&#xD;
words of common prose can never tell) what&#xD;
this period of her life was to Ermine. She&#xD;
was in a dream somewhat like the trance into&#xD;
which she might have fallen over the "Wal-&#xD;
purgis Night," or the Madonna di San Sisto;&#xD;
only those states of passionate feeling would&#xD;
have been but types of the great love which&#xD;
came to her. now, even as this love was again&#xD;
but a type of the eternal Love toward which&#xD;
our earth-weighed eyes are rarely Ufted.&#xD;
Madelon regarded her cousin during this&#xD;
time with the cool, calm, scientific curiosity of&#xD;
a person to whom such extravagance was ut-&#xD;
terly incomprehensible, and (but for the testi-,&#xD;
mony of sight) utterly incredible.&#xD;
"I try my best to understand you, Ermine,"&#xD;
she said, a little plaintively one day1 "but I&#xD;
can't? Are you really so happy as you seem?&#xD;
It is the most extraordinary thing to me that&#xD;
you should be! And, if you are happy, where&#xD;
on earth are your rational grounds for it?"&#xD;
Ermine laughed-a soft, sweet ripple, com-&#xD;
mon to her lips of late.&#xD;
"What do yott call rational grounds?" she&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
&#xD;
The other shrugged her shoulders in the&#xD;
significant Gallic fashion which she possessed&#xD;
to perfection.&#xD;
"Something more than fine abstractions,&#xD;
you may be sure. Excuse me if I speak&#xD;
plainly; but indeed I am so very curious, and&#xD;
if you will only tell me what you find in Alan&#xD;
Erie to elevate you to the seventh heaven at&#xD;
the mere proposal of bestowing all your wealth,&#xD;
and beauty~and talents on him, I shall be con-&#xD;
tented. I can't bear to be puzzled, and this&#xD;
does puzzle me. He really seems to me one of&#xD;
the most commonplace men in existence."&#xD;
"You know nothing about him, Made-&#xD;
Ion."&#xD;
"I am not in love with him, my dear-&#xD;
thank Heaven for it 1-but I fancy I know him&#xD;
all the better 9U that account.' He is moder-&#xD;
ately good-looking-but so are hundreds of&#xD;
other mcix He is moderately clever-but so&#xD;
are dozens at least of others. He is a good&#xD;
sailor, no doubt-but that does not concern&#xD;
you. He is sufficiently amiable and kind-&#xD;
hearted to let that abominable dog of his break&#xD;
other people's vases-but I really don't see the&#xD;
virtue of tkat. Now, tell me, if you can, what&#xD;
else he is?"&#xD;
"Indeed, Madelon, if I talked forever, I&#xD;
could not make you understand any better than&#xD;
you do now, what he is."&#xD;
"Why not? Am I so stupid, or are his&#xD;
virtues so exalted?"&#xD;
"Neither-as you well know. But he is&#xD;
simply Alan, and that is the end of the matter.&#xD;
His character is written on his face, for all to&#xD;
read; if you have not read it there, you&#xD;
would not be likely to read it any better inmy&#xD;
words."&#xD;
"But, Ermine-"&#xD;
"Well, Madelon?"&#xD;
".Dotry to tell me what you see in him.&#xD;
He is not like you in the least-though you&#xD;
sire both fond of dabbling in paints. What&#xD;
is his spell ?-what is his charm? It can't be&#xD;
only because he was kind to you when you&#xD;
were a child 1"&#xD;
"No," said Ermine, "of course it is not,&#xD;
that. If he had been a different person, grat-&#xD;
itude would have stopped short at gratitude,&#xD;
and never gone on to love. I can't tell you why&#xD;
it is that every thing he 4~oes is pleasant to me,&#xD;
every thing he says, music to my ears; but so&#xD;
it is. You are right in saying that we are not&#xD;
alike; but I suppose we differ in order to cor.&#xD;
respond. At least I am sure there is al.&#xD;
&#xD;
ways harmony with us-we never differ to&#xD;
jar."&#xD;
"In other words, you love him."&#xD;
"Yes, I love him till I tremble. I am so&#xD;
happy that I would not care if the world ended&#xD;
to-night; for I know I can never be more&#xD;
happy, and fear I may be less."&#xD;
"Mba Dieu I"&#xD;
Madelon's astonishment culminated in this&#xD;
exclamation. She looked at her cousin several&#xD;
minutes without speaking-then shook her&#xD;
head with the air of one who says, "I give&#xD;
it up."&#xD;
"For the mere novelty of the thing, I be-&#xD;
lieve I will cultivate a grande passion!" said&#xD;
she, meditatively. "I wonder if any man in&#xD;
the world could ever make a fool of me! I&#xD;
don't mcl~n that you are a fool, Ermine-I&#xD;
don't pretend to decide that point. I only&#xD;
mean that I should be, if I ever fell in love.&#xD;
And when, pray, is the contract of marriage&#xD;
to be formally made out-Ermine H6l~ne St.&#xD;
Amand, of the island of Martinique, and Alan&#xD;
Erie, of-what shall I say, the good city of&#xD;
Charleston, or the good ship Adventure?"&#xD;
"The good ship Adventure always, if you&#xD;
have no objection," said a voice behind the&#xD;
two girls-a voice which made Ermine start&#xD;
and turn, with light flashing to her eyes, and&#xD;
color to her cheeks.&#xD;
Alan stood in the outer door-tall, hand-&#xD;
some, stately-seeming to bring a breath of&#xD;
the fragrant outer world with him, in his&#xD;
smile, or in the rose in his button-hole--it was&#xD;
hard to say which. He looked much more&#xD;
like a cavalier than a sailor, for he wore&#xD;
riding-gloves and spurs; but the limpid eyes&#xD;
had a gleam of amusement in their sea-colored&#xD;
depths, as he lazily answered Madelon's glance&#xD;
of interrogative surprise,&#xD;
"Are you wondering where I caine from,&#xD;
Miss Lautrec? Ask Ermine, and she will tell&#xD;
you that I sometimes riae out of the floor, and&#xD;
then again, vanish in a cloud of sulphur. No-&#xD;
body can talk of me with impunity-I always&#xD;
appear on the scene in time to say a good&#xD;
word for myself."&#xD;
"Then," said Madelon, very dryly, "I shall&#xD;
be careful how I talk of you hereafter. I as-&#xD;
sure you it is by no means a common or&#xD;
favorite amusement of mine to canvas either&#xD;
your character or your local habitation. I&#xD;
only spoke of you by chance a minute ago."&#xD;
He raised his eyebrows a little-so much&#xD;
malicious meaning quivering around his lips,&#xD;
&#xD;
that she knew in a minute that he had either&#xD;
overheard or guessed at more than her closing&#xD;
remark.&#xD;
"Indeed I'm sorry for that," said he, com-&#xD;
ing forward and sitting down by her. "I was&#xD;
in hopes you had been telling Ermine what a&#xD;
nonpareil she had secured.~ Your good opinion&#xD;
would be worth having, because I am inclined&#xD;
to think that you don't give it very often."&#xD;
"You are perfectly right in that."&#xD;
"I wonder if I could not secure itpas-c1~-oit&#xD;
de conqu~te? I've a mind to try while Ermine&#xD;
changes her dress!"&#xD;
"Change my dress! What for, Alan?"&#xD;
"For Mignonne, who is at the door. I did&#xD;
not send you word that I was coming, because&#xD;
I knew from experience how quickly yoas can&#xD;
put on a habit."&#xD;
"I shall not be ten minutes," said she-..&#xD;
and was out of the room as lightly and as&#xD;
swiftly as a bird.&#xD;
In the course of the next half-hour she&#xD;
came down-looking two degrees more slender&#xD;
than when she had gone up, in consequence&#xD;
of being robed in close-fitting black, which&#xD;
showed every line of her figure to the best&#xD;
advantage. After all, there is no possible cos-&#xD;
tume in which a pretty woman looks prettier&#xD;
thun in the dear, well-known habit, the fashion&#xD;
of which variety not through many genera-&#xD;
tions. Barring the detestable high hat (which&#xD;
is as ugly as any and every other fashion that&#xD;
ever came from England), it is1the most grace-&#xD;
ful and most universally becoming costume&#xD;
that ever was invented. Ermine's artist eye&#xD;
and French taste prevented her disfiguring her&#xD;
toilet with this monstrosity of a head-gear.&#xD;
On the contrary, she wore a soft, low-crowned&#xD;
felt, one side of which was looped with' an&#xD;
aigrette of cut steel, while an ostrich-plume&#xD;
swept entirely around the other. "You look&#xD;
like a pretty little Spanish contrabanda"&#xD;
Alan had said, Iaugbin~,' when she flrs5 male&#xD;
her appearance in this;' but he confessed that&#xD;
a more bewitching ckapean never was invented,&#xD;
and Ermine was doubly fond of wearing what&#xD;
had met with such unqualified approval from&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Ready, Alan?" she asked, pausing in&#xD;
the hall to draw on her gauntlets, and glance&#xD;
int&amp;amp; the sitting-room where Alan and Madelon&#xD;
were still t~e-d4~te.&#xD;
"Ready? certainly," answered Alan, rising,&#xD;
and coming forward. Then, after making his&#xD;
adieux to Madden, they went out together.&#xD;

58       ~EBB-TID~E&#xD;
&#xD;
Before the door, a groom was standing with&#xD;
two animals-a graceful, thorough-bred bay&#xD;
mare, and a well-built horse of the color&#xD;
known as chestnut-sorrel-while Nix lay on&#xD;
guard beside them, not having been allowed&#xD;
to cross the threshold, because his ever-waving&#xD;
tail had, a few days before, swept ~ rare&#xD;
r marble vase from its pedestal.&#xD;
What a comfort it is when a man knows&#xD;
how to put a woman on horseback! Alan&#xD;
knew perfectly. He held out his hand, Ermine&#xD;
placed one daintily-booted foot in it, gave one&#xD;
elastic spring, and was in the saddle as se-&#xD;
curely as Di Vernon; the modus ope~-andi on&#xD;
the gentleman's part reminding one somewhat&#xD;
of "Young Lochinvar," who, according to the&#xD;
ballad, must have been an accomplished pro-&#xD;
ficient in this rare art:&#xD;
"One touch to her hand, and one word to her ear,&#xD;
When they reached the hall-door, and the charger&#xD;
stood near;&#xD;
So light to the croup the fair lady he swung,&#xD;
So light to the saddle before her he sprung.&#xD;
'She Is won I We are gone o'er buab, bank, and&#xD;
scaur-&#xD;
They'll have deet steeds that follow,' quoth young&#xD;
Lochlnvar~'&#xD;
It would not have required very fleet steeds,&#xD;
however, to follow this pair as they rode down&#xD;
the street, escorted by Nix, and followed by&#xD;
the admiring gaze of the groom, and one. small&#xD;
boy who paused and looked, and looked and&#xD;
paused again, while he balanced a tray on his&#xD;
head. Madelon, too, looked over the blind,&#xD;
with a cynical smile curling her scarlet lip.&#xD;
"As happy as a couple of children or a&#xD;
couple of fools!" said she to herself. "Grace&#xD;
d Dieu 1 what incomprehensible absurdity-&#xD;
on Ermine's side at least! Of course, he is&#xD;
doing amazingly well for himself; and, no&#xD;
doubt, he finds it pleasant enough to make a&#xD;
fool of her. Would 1-could I-shall I-ever&#xD;

should find a better mate than the captain of a&#xD;

ever so handsome, and I must coufess that he.&#xD;

CHAPTER N.&#xD;
"LOVE MATH SET oun DAYS IN MUSIC TO THH&#xD;
SELF-SAME AIR."&#xD;
MEANWHILE, Ermine and Alan, having left&#xD;
the city behind, were riding farther and farther&#xD;
into the lovely, flower-scented country, with&#xD;
the dying glory of the June day all around&#xD;
them. They were so happy-and every thing&#xD;
~emed to conspire to give this happiness such&#xD;
a faIr and gracious framework! Somebody&#xD;
says that Nature apparently takes pleasure in&#xD;
surrounding young lovers with brightness; and&#xD;
that Fate, otherwise a stern task-mistress,&#xD;
finds delight in casting their lines in pleasant&#xD;
places. Certainly it was the case, for a time&#xD;
at least, with these. The sweet idyl of their&#xD;
love flowed all the more brightly in that it was&#xD;
reflected from every bright scene around them;&#xD;
and the dumb face of Earth seemed in this&#xD;
happy summer-time, this glorious June, to be&#xD;
wreathed with gladness in their honor. As&#xD;
they rode they talked, and talking smiled-&#xD;
not so much because their words were other&#xD;
than commonplace, as becausethey had what&#xD;
George Eliot calls "the ineffable sense of&#xD;
youth in common.~~&#xD;
"What were you saying to Madelon?"&#xD;
asked Ermine, after a while. "She is so pretty.&#xD;
and can be so charming when she likes, that&#xD;
I felt half inclined to be jealous when I came&#xD;
down-stairs an~d saw your confidential-looking&#xD;
le'te-d -tile."&#xD;
"She is pretty," said Alan, coolly, "and I&#xD;
suppose she can be charming when she likes&#xD;
-a woman with that kind of eyes usually can&#xD;
-but she does not often like, so far as I am&#xD;
concerned. If she were a princess, she could&#xD;
not hold herself more haughtily aloof," he went&#xD;
on, with a slight laugh. "I suppose it is on&#xD;
account of the marine taintupon me. Ermine,&#xD;
my darling, you are a brave woman to make&#xD;
up your mind to marry a sea-captain!"&#xD;

she promised me to stand by you. 'Through&#xD;
thick, and thin?' I asked. 'Yes,' she an-&#xD;
swered, 'through thick and thin.' Then she&#xD;
gave me her hand on it; and b~r Jove! Ermine,&#xD;
it is a wonderfully pretty one!"&#xD;
"Of course itis a pretty one," said Ermine,&#xD;
smiling, yet pondering a little in her own mind&#xD;
on the difference between men and women.&#xD;
Could she, by any possibility speak in that&#xD;
tone of the hand, or foot, or mustache, or any&#xD;
thing else whatever, belonging to any other&#xD;
man? Her masculine world was as narrow as&#xD;
Eve's. This Adam was all she saw or knew;&#xD;
all other men were to her as if they had not&#xD;
been. But Alan had not the leastobjection to&#xD;
clasping Madelon's white hand, and gazing&#xD;
into Madelon's dark eyes, appreciating both&#xD;
the one and the other as much as if there had&#xD;
been no Ermine in the world. Did this curious&#xD;
fact come of "man's love" being of man's&#xD;
life a thing apart, she wondered; and, so&#xD;
wondering, was silent for so long that Alan&#xD;
spoke.&#xD;
"What are you thinking of, little one?&#xD;
Your face might serve as a cast of Ii Pen-&#xD;
seroso, as you ride along there. Do you im-&#xD;
agine that there is any prospect of your need-&#xD;
ing Madelon's championship while I am&#xD;
gone?"&#xD;
"Scarcely," answered she. " They" (by&#xD;
this ambiguous phrase she meant the Erie&#xD;
family) "knowthatl am independent of them,&#xD;
and they will not trouble me, I am sure. Then&#xD;
there is my guardian. He is a tower of&#xD;
strength."&#xD;
"But an uncomfortably distant tower of&#xD;
strength. 0 Ermine, Ermine-"&#xD;
"Well, Alan, what?"&#xD;
"I was only going to curse the poverty&#xD;
which necessitates my leaving you. But that is&#xD;
cowardly and ungrateful. Suppose I had never&#xD;
won you-suppose I had come home and found&#xD;
you married to Raymond?"&#xD;
"Suppose something possible~whileyou are&#xD;
about it, Alan."&#xD;
"You are sure it is impossible, Ermine?"&#xD;
"Sure, AI~n!" (indignantly). "What do&#xD;
you mean? At this absurdly late day, are&#xD;
you going to pretend to be jealous ?-and of&#xD;
Raymond, of all people!"&#xD;
"Jealous! Well, no. Only distrustful of&#xD;
my own great good luck. What on earth you&#xD;
see in me, Ermine, I am sure I can't tell."&#xD;
"And what on earth you see in me, Alan, I&#xD;
am sure I can't tell!"&#xD;
&#xD;
They look at each other and laugh-happy&#xD;
as the children to whom Madelon had contempt-&#xD;
uously likened them.&#xD;
"Well, well,"said Captain ErIe, witha short&#xD;
sigh, "we shall have to learn the worst of each&#xD;
other hereafter, for we certainly know only the&#xD;
best new. I wonder if you have any worst,&#xD;
Ermine?"&#xD;
"Have you, Alan?"&#xD;
"I! Good Heavens, yes! My dear child,&#xD;
whatever you do, don't go to work and make&#xD;
a paladin of me. I am only a commonplace&#xD;
man, with the devil's own temper, sometimes."&#xD;
Ermine shook her head with a laugh.&#xD;
"I don't believe one word of it! You&#xD;
need not abuse yourself to get into my good&#xD;
graces. I am not Madelon."&#xD;
"Thanks to a merciful Providence, you are&#xD;
not indeed I"&#xD;
"Alan!" (with a ridiculous attempt at a&#xD;
frown), "don't be irreverent."&#xD;
"Is it irreverent to thank God that you&#xD;
are what you are, swc0S&amp;amp;eart? I'll not be-&#xD;
lieve that. But, as for my temper-let any-&#xD;
body molest you while I am gone, and I can&#xD;
promise them a taste of it when I come back 1"&#xD;
Ermine glanced at him from under the&#xD;
'rolling rim pf her hat, and was a little sur-&#xD;
prised and a good deal edified to observe that&#xD;
a considerable gleam of the temper of which&#xD;
he spoke had flashed into his usually genial&#xD;
face and sunny eyes. She liked him all the&#xD;
better for it, since It is an astonishing but&#xD;
most undoubted fact that women-especially&#xD;
when they are very young and consequently&#xD;
very foolish-do like this thing which of all&#xD;
others most surely promises a plentiful harvest&#xD;
of-future wretchedness and tears. There is a&#xD;
certain popular proverb, which is not in the&#xD;
least complimentary to the weaker, sex-about&#xD;
a woman, a spaniel, and a walnut-tree-but,&#xD;
taking it in a moral sense, we are sometimes&#xD;
compelled to acknowledge that it is in a meas-&#xD;
ure true. Most men certainly like to domi-&#xD;
neer, and most women (until the delightful&#xD;
pastime has lost its novelty) like to be domi-&#xD;
neered over-which is a convenieht arrange-&#xD;
ment of Nature, to say the least. Let it not&#xD;
be supposed, however, that Alan was at all&#xD;
inclined to Ciesarism, or that Ermine would&#xD;
have been at all partial to being browbeaten.,&#xD;
Only the instinct of the woman was gratified&#xD;
by that gleam of menacing light which was&#xD;
called forth at the mere thought of harm or&#xD;
wrong to her.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Alan dear," she said, after a moment,&#xD;
"since you think it right to go, I have not, as&#xD;
you know, even a desire to keep you; only-&#xD;
only-" here the rebellious tears rose up-" I&#xD;
have felt an instinct from the first that if you&#xD;
do go something wrn happen; and that, after&#xD;
this dream is broken, we can never, never be&#xD;
so happy again."&#xD;
"But, my darling, that is nonsense!"&#xD;
"I know it, and I have tried-oh, so hard!&#xD;
-to put it from me. But I cannot. I am&#xD;
sure all this is too bright to last-it is too&#xD;
good to be true. Earth is not heaven-nor&#xD;
meant to be. Now, it would be heaven to&#xD;
me if I spent life with you, as I have spent&#xD;
these last few weeks. So I know it will not&#xD;
be permitted-something will come between&#xD;
us."&#xD;
"But," said Alan, with hard, logical corn-&#xD;
mon.sense, "what can possibly come between&#xD;
us, save your own will?"&#xD;
"I don't know," said she. "But "-and&#xD;
riding along in the warm June air, he saw her&#xD;
shiver.-" I am sure that, if we ever meet again,&#xD;
it will not be as we meet now. You need not&#xD;
reason with me, Alan, for I have reasoned with&#xD;
myself. You need not even laugh at me~ for&#xD;
I have laughed at myself. Nothing shakes&#xD;
the deep, settled impression. Echoing through&#xD;
my mind all the time are two verses which I&#xD;
saw not long ago:&#xD;
'Some there be that shadows kiss,&#xD;
Some have but a shadow's bliss.'&#xD;
Will it be so with us? Shall we only kiss this&#xD;
shadow of love which seems so bright and&#xD;
sweet?"&#xD;
"You must choose your metaphors bet-&#xD;
ter," said he, trying to smile away the sudden&#xD;
cloud of pathetic sadness which had fallen&#xD;
over her face. "Our love is not a shadow-it&#xD;
is a reality. Ermine, if I know that you are&#xD;
making yourself miserable with such thoughts&#xD;
as these, how can I be other than miserable in&#xD;
leaving you?"&#xD;
"Forgive me," said Ermine, penitently.&#xD;
"I did not-indeedI did not-mean to speak&#xD;
of it. I am sure I don't know why I did.&#xD;
Only, Alan-"&#xD;
"Well, my love?"&#xD;
"Mint you go?"&#xD;
Oh, world of entreaty in three small words!&#xD;
Transcribed, they look like the most ordinary&#xD;
question; but, with the heart.eloquence that&#xD;
stirred them, and the dark eyes that seconded&#xD;
&#xD;
them, Alan Erle had a hard tug with himself&#xD;
before he could answer:&#xD;
"My darling, don'tyou know that I must?"&#xD;
"How can I know it 2" she asked. Then&#xD;
as a sudden rush of tears came, "0 .Alan,&#xD;
Alan, if you were only going to take me with&#xD;
you, I should be contentt,'&#xD;
"But, Ermine-"&#xD;
"Yes," said she, hastily, "I know you&#xD;
can't, and I know, also, that it is not at all&#xD;
'proper' for me to say such a thing. I love&#xD;
you too well, Alan" (smiling at him through&#xD;
her tears), "I am sure I shall spoil you. They&#xD;
say-experienced women say-that it is al-&#xD;
ways bad policy to show one's affection to the&#xD;
man for whom one cares."&#xD;
"Confound such hypocrites!" said he, un-&#xD;
gallantly. "Let them practise their own pre-&#xD;
cepts if they choose, but, for God's sake, don't&#xD;
you take a leaf from them! I would not have&#xD;
you altered by one jot or tittle, for all the ex-&#xD;
perienced women in the world. I wish to&#xD;
Heaven I could take you with me! But, since&#xD;
that is impossible, I will do this-I wrn leave&#xD;
it for you to decide whether or not I ~hall go."&#xD;
"No, no, Alan" (shrinking), "I cannot&#xD;
accept such a responsibility."&#xD;
"I confess it would be a little sacrifice to&#xD;
me," said he, looking away from her. "You&#xD;
see, Ermine, your wealth stands like a wall&#xD;
between us. I cannot forget it -nor will&#xD;
other people forget it either. The devil him-&#xD;
self seems to inspire most of the congratula-&#xD;
tions ~that I have received!" he went on, sav-&#xD;
agely. "The significant words and looks and&#xD;
tones-nobody in the world will ever know,&#xD;
half the people in the world would never be-&#xD;
lieve, how they have cut me to the quick!"&#xD;
"I know, Alan "-and a tiny, gauntleted'&#xD;
hand went involuntarily out toward him. "It&#xD;
is because I ks~ow so well, that I have not said&#xD;
one word before-that I am sorry for having&#xD;
said one word now. Go, dear, if you must go.&#xD;
I can wait-as I have waited before."&#xD;
The pathetic eyes looked at him as she&#xD;
uttered the last words-steadfast and brave,&#xD;
though the lips quivered piteously. Alan had&#xD;
ridden close beside her, and was holding the&#xD;
hand which she extended clasped close against&#xD;
his breast, as he gazed into the pure, dark&#xD;
depths, trying perhaps to read the riddle of&#xD;
his fate there. The horses, feeling the reins-&#xD;
slack and more slack upon their necks, had&#xD;
come down to a snail's pace, and were indul-.&#xD;

'the way of sociably rubbing their noses to.&#xD;
gather, while Nix stood on the side of the&#xD;
road, and, no doubt, wondered in his own mind&#xD;
what on earth his master was about&#xD;
"Ermine," said Alan, passionately, "my&#xD;
faith in you is like the rock of Gibraltar-it is&#xD;
too great to be placed in a mere fallible creat-&#xD;
ure. Child, for God's sake, take heed what&#xD;
you do! If you should ever fail me-how&#xD;
could I forgive myself for having gone?"&#xD;
"I cannot say that nothing will befall me,&#xD;
Alan," said the sweet, loyal voice, "for life&#xD;
and all the circumstances of life are in God's&#xD;
hand; but I cam say that I will never fail you.&#xD;
Nothing b~it death shall ever take me from&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"I ought to be sure of that," he said. "I&#xD;
have known you as child and woman, and&#xD;
never yet found a flaw in you. They did well&#xD;
to n~sme you Ermine," he went on, tenderly;&#xD;
"the crmin~ is the purest and whitest of all&#xD;

Hold up your head, can't you?"&#xD;
This unromantic conclusion was addressed&#xD;
to 'the horse, whose head had gone lower and&#xD;
lower between his legs, as if he meant to in.&#xD;
dulge in a mouthful of nice white sand. One&#xD;
sharp jerk of the bit brought it up again in&#xD;
short order, however, and then Captain Erle&#xD;
concluded his speech:&#xD;
"Somehow I feel more unwilling to go to&#xD;
sea than I ever did in my life. It is natural,&#xD;
'though, since I leave you behiad~-my hostage&#xD;
in the hands of Fortune. Ermine" (fiercely),&#xD;
"if God does not deal well with you, I shall&#xD;
not believe that there is a God!"&#xD;
"0 Alan, hush!" cried she, shrinking as&#xD;
she might have shrunk from a blow, for she&#xD;
was of a nature wholly and unaffectedly de-&#xD;
vout. "Don't talk in that way, it sounds like&#xD;
a defiance-which is so awful! Don't you re-&#xD;
member what somebody says, not very rever-&#xD;
ently, perhaps, but still very sensibly-' It is&#xD;
never wise to try conclusions with the Al-&#xD;
mighty.' Who am I, that I should be exempt&#xD;
from the suffering of earth?"&#xD;
"You shall be exempt from it when once&#xD;
jyou are mine, to have and to hold-safe from&#xD;
~ali others," naid he, boldly and not over-rever-&#xD;
-ently. "Ermine, Ermine, stop-think-must&#xD;
I, shall I go?"&#xD;
&#xD;
She stopped and thought-long and deeply.&#xD;
What a struggle it was with her to decide as&#xD;
she did decide, no one, save God, could tell.&#xD;
She fought the fight deep in her own breast,&#xD;
and it was only the calm result of victory&#xD;
which he saw at last.&#xD;
"Alan, dear," she said, in a voice as soft&#xD;
and low as the "wind of the western sea," "I&#xD;
know that you want to go-that is, I know&#xD;
that you will not be content unlessyou do go&#xD;
-so I will not say one word to keep you. Af-&#xD;
ter all, what are these fancies, but fancieb?&#xD;
Nothing can harm me while you are gone; all&#xD;
the powers of earth cannot make me unfaith-&#xD;
ful to you; and I shall remember that our own&#xD;
dear Lord watches over the sea as over the&#xD;
land, and will hear my prayers for you let you&#xD;
be where you will. The days will be&#xD;
and long while you are away; but I can think&#xD;
of you, and look for your letters, and remem-&#xD;
ber that every hour takes me nearer the&#xD;
blessed hour of your return."&#xD;
"And so you say-' Go 9'"&#xD;
"No, I cannot say that-but I will not&#xD;
say, ยฃ5tay.~~~&#xD;
"Then you menu, 'go' - and you are&#xD;
right. A man in the full prime of all his&#xD;
powers would be a contemptible fellow in-&#xD;
deed who threw up all his hopes of fortune&#xD;
or advancement in the world, and sat down&#xD;
to be happy-on his wife's wealth. Perhaps&#xD;
some men might stand it and not lose all&#xD;
self-respect; but it would crush all the man-&#xD;
hood out of mc! Nobody could despise more&#xD;
than I should despise myself-and you would&#xD;
despise me too, Ermine."&#xD;
"Should I, Alan?"&#xD;
"Yes, my pet-my pretty, soft-eyed dar-&#xD;
ling-I think you would, after a time. Even&#xD;
Nix would turn the cold shoulder on me. So&#xD;
it is better as it is. I have lingered in this&#xD;
paradise of roses a little too long already,&#xD;
or I shouldn't have hesitated over such a&#xD;
plain duty. The sea is what I need -the&#xD;
sea will soon take all the nonsense out of&#xD;
me!"&#xD;
"Well," said Ermine, with a sigh, "if it is&#xD;
settled, it is settled. We will make it a ta-&#xD;
booed subject, Alan. I don't mean to think&#xD;
of it any more until it is time to say good-by.&#xD;
Now, let us take a canter."&#xD;

I,-Fom a Charlestcsa paper~ date Jhae 13, 185-.&#xD;
"Died, at Fort de France, in the island of Marti-&#xD;
nique, on the 29th of May, Henri Charles Yivieux, a na-&#xD;
tive of Bordeaux, France, and former colonel of Volti-&#xD;
geurs In the French service, aged seventy-four years&#xD;
and eight months. May he rest In peace!"&#xD;
II.-~--From the same paper, date October 12,185-.&#xD;
"We regret to learn that the brig Adventure, Cap-&#xD;
tain Erie, homeward bound for the port of Charleston&#xD;
from Buenos Ayres, was caught In the terrific storm&#xD;
which visited the whole Atlantic coast on the 20th of&#xD;
September, and wrecked off the coast of French Gui-&#xD;
ana. A portion of the crew were rescued by a French&#xD;
transport out from Cayenne; but the large majority, it&#xD;
Is reared, have perished, with the captain and cargo.&#xD;
The latter, we learn fl~om Messrs. Miller &amp;amp; Sons, who&#xD;
were the principal consignees, Is partly covered by in-&#xD;
surance. Captain Erie was well known and highly es-&#xD;
teemed in our community, and we tender our condo-&#xD;
lences to his relatives and friends."&#xD;
III.-.Fi'om the same, of a weeA~ later.&#xD;
"We learn, from a New York paper, that the sur-&#xD;
vivors of the shipwrecked crew of the brig Adventure&#xD;
reached that port a day or two ago in the packet Elvh-a,&#xD;
out from Ravre fourteen days. Meetingthe latter, they&#xD;
were transfen-ed from the French transport L'Hiroa-&#xD;
delle, and so reached their destination muchsooner than&#xD;
would otherwise have been possible. The party con-&#xD;
sists of seven men-the mate and six seamen-and&#xD;
their narrative extinguishes the last faint hope that&#xD;
Captain Erie might have escaped a watery grave. This&#xD;
gallant sailor remained on his vessel to the last, and,&#xD;
having Bent off one boat, was preparing to launch the&#xD;
second, when, with an unexpected lurch, the ship went&#xD;
down, carrying all on board with her. Once more we&#xD;
must record our regret at the accident which has thus&#xD;
cut short the valuable life of one so well fitted for use-&#xD;
fulness and honor. Captain Erie leaves a large circle&#xD;
of friends who will long deplorehis loss."&#xD;

CHAPTER     I.            /&#xD;
DOES TRUTH SOUND BITTER?&#xD;
"CHRIsTMas comes but once a year," say&#xD;
the children, regretfully; but it is likely that&#xD;
their elders, as a general rule, are heartily&#xD;
glad of the fact-for, to all, save the ex-&#xD;
tremely youthful, Christmas represents more&#xD;
of annoyance than of pleasure. It is a glori-&#xD;
Ous and thrice-blessed season, regarded from&#xD;
the Christian point of view; but, regarded&#xD;
from the side of the earth earthy-a side&#xD;
which nnluckily every thing more or less pos-&#xD;
sesses-it is a season from which the vast ma-&#xD;
jority of people shrink nervously; a season&#xD;
when the poverty of those poor whom we&#xD;
"have always with us" seems to weigh more&#xD;
heavily upon them than at other times, by con-&#xD;
trast with the wealth and luxury so lavishly&#xD;
displayed; a season when heads of families&#xD;
are sometimes driven to absolute frenzy in the&#xD;
effort to accomplish that financial result known&#xD;
as "making both ends meet;" a season when&#xD;
parties, balls, receptions, and all those gather.&#xD;
&#xD;
ings which go to make "society," are in full&#xD;
blast, and when all the heartaches and head-&#xD;
aches, the torn dresses and torn affections,&#xD;
the outrivalled jewels and rejected addresses,&#xD;
which accompany them, are in full blast also;&#xD;
a season when dolls and tea-sets, hobby-horses&#xD;
and drums, are rampant, when one's house is&#xD;
filled, one's pockets emptied, and one's tem-&#xD;
per, like as not, ruffled to a degree from which&#xD;
it will not recover for so~ime.&#xD;
Yes, Chrirtmas come~~ut once a year,&#xD;
and it came with a leaden sky and stiff&#xD;
northeaster to Charleston on the 24th oC&#xD;
December in that year which had given to&#xD;
Alan Erie and Ermine St. Amand their happy&#xD;
May-time of youth and love. The gay little&#xD;
city wore ~er gayest holiday dress, the shops&#xD;
were thronged with eager purchasers, the&#xD;
streets filled with bright faces, and various&#xD;
penny trumpets had already sounded the pre.&#xD;
l"de of that discord which was to break forth&#xD;
at nightfall, when a tall, handsome man with&#xD;
something unmistakably sailor-like in his ap-&#xD;
pearance, a man who was followed by an im-&#xD;
mense leonine dog, entered the warehouse of&#xD;
Erie &amp;amp; Co., and asked the first clerk he met if&#xD;
Mr. Raymond Erie was in the counting-room.&#xD;
The clerk in question was a new-coiner, and&#xD;
did not recognize his interlocutor. Being in&#xD;
a preoccupied and Christmas-eve frame of mind,&#xD;
he barely glanced at the speaker, saw that he&#xD;
was evidently a person of some consequence,&#xD;
despite a rough pea-jacket and0 a loose hand-&#xD;
kerchief knotted aroitnd his throat, and, an-&#xD;
swering in the affirmative, said something about&#xD;
stating business" and "letting Mr. ErIe&#xD;
know."&#xD;
The sailor smiled a little, and, with a single&#xD;
motion of the hand, stayed his steps. "I won't&#xD;
trouble you to let him know," he said. "I&#xD;
will see him myself.-Stay here, Nix!" he&#xD;
added, to his canine companion. The dog&#xD;
crouched obediently down, and, before the clerk&#xD;
could expostulate or interfere, the stranger&#xD;
had passed into the inner sanctuary of trade.&#xD;
As it chanced, Raymond Erie was alone.&#xD;
On the eve of the great holiday, he was sitting&#xD;
at the desk, his slight figure bent over an&#xD;
enormous pile of ledgers, while the clerks&#xD;
lounged aimlessly aboilt the warehouse, and&#xD;
even the book-keeper read a newspaper over&#xD;
the fire of the outer room. In truth, the ac-&#xD;
counts of the firm needed the careful revising&#xD;
of the master-eye and master-hand, and on&#xD;
this the junior partner-looking more pale and&#xD;
5&#xD;
&#xD;
thin than when we saw him last-was deeply&#xD;
intent. Hearing the door open, he looked up,&#xD;
frowning, from a balance - sheet. The tall&#xD;
figure standing before klan uncovered with a&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
"Merry Christmas, Raymond!" he said.&#xD;
"You see I am back, like a bad penny, after&#xD;
all!"&#xD;
Raymond Erle sprang from his seat, white&#xD;
to the lips, and quivering like a man who meets&#xD;
the ghost of one long dead.&#xD;
"Good God!" he gasped, clutching at the&#xD;
table-" Alan!"&#xD;
"Alan, or his ghost," said the other ad.&#xD;
dancing nearer with a smile, "only I'd make&#xD;
rather a substantial ghost, don't you think so?&#xD;
It is flesh and blood, beyond a doubt; shake&#xD;
hands and see! By Jove, my dear fellow, how&#xD;
glad I am glad to see you again!"&#xD;
Oiie would have thought that these cor-&#xD;
dial words should have come from the other,&#xD;
from the pale manwho barely suffered his hand&#xD;
to be pressed in his brother's earnest grasp, as&#xD;
he managed to say:&#xD;
"What an extraordinary surprise, Alan!&#xD;
For Heaven's sake, where do you come from?&#xD;
-how did you escape ?-and why didn't you&#xD;
write?"&#xD;
"Where do I come from?" repeated Alan,&#xD;
with some surprise. "From the brig Dolores,&#xD;
out from Rio Janeiro, that has just dropped&#xD;
her anchor in the bay. How did I escape?&#xD;
That's a long story, and can be given in full&#xD;
another time; only I can tell you that, if it&#xD;
hadn't been for Nix, Ishould be at the bottom&#xD;
of the Atlantic now. Why didn't I write?&#xD;
Why, I did write from Rio to Ermine. Has she&#xD;
never received the letter?"&#xD;
"And she-you all-thought I was dead&#xD;
until this minute?"&#xD;
"Until this minute, I assure you."&#xD;
"Good Heavens! what a lucky thing that&#xD;
I did not go up to the house and startle her!&#xD;
You must go at once and break the news to&#xD;
her, Raymond. She "-through his bronzed&#xD;
skin it was evident that he paled a little as he&#xD;
asked the question-" she is quite well, is she&#xD;
not?"&#xD;
Raymond's hand went suddenlyto his throat&#xD;
and pulled open his cravat. "What devil's&#xD;
luck!" he thought, "has brought him to&#xD;
me!"&#xD;
"She ?-Ermine, do you mean?" he asked&#xD;
aloud-nervously anxious to gain a little time.&#xD;
&#xD;
65&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="66" xml:id="VAC8067-00000033"/>&#xD;
66&#xD;
&#xD;
EBB-TIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Ermine, of course," answered Alan, ren-&#xD;
dered suspicious by this hesitation. " Who else&#xD;
should Imean ? For God's sake, speak quickly !&#xD;
Is she well?"&#xD;
" She is quite well."&#xD;
Hoarsely and with an effort, these few&#xD;
wards were spoken-so hoarsely, with so much&#xD;
effort, despite all the speaker's well-trained&#xD;
powers of dissimulation, that Alan would have&#xD;
been both blind and deaf if he had not noticed&#xD;
it. One other step brought him close to his&#xD;
brother's side ; and he grasped his arm with no&#xD;
gentle fingers.&#xD;
" Raymond," he said, shortly, " you have&#xD;
something to tell me. Out withit at once! I&#xD;
am no woman, to have news ' broken' to me,.&#xD;
Is she sick ?-is she dying ?-is "-he almost&#xD;
choked here-" is she dead?" .&#xD;
"She is neither sick, nor dying, nor dead,"&#xD;
answered Raymond. " I-I will telJl you all&#xD;
about it, Alan, if you will sit down and hear me&#xD;
patiently."&#xD;
But, instead of sitting down, Alan tightened&#xD;
his grasp until it was many a long day before&#xD;
the mark of those muscular fingers left his&#xD;
brother's arm.&#xD;
" Tell me," he repeated, savagely-" tell&#xD;
me at once, 'or, by God, I will tear it from&#xD;
your throat ! Where is she ?-how is she ?"&#xD;
Now, Raymond Erle was no coward-physi-&#xD;
-cally, indeed, there were few braver men-yet&#xD;
there was something in the face confronting&#xD;
him, and perhaps-who knows? ?- something&#xD;
-also in his own conscience, that made him&#xD;
shrink and quail.&#xD;
" For Heaven's sake," he expostulated, "re-&#xD;
:member that we thought you were dead."&#xD;
" That is outside the question," said Alan,&#xD;
sternly. " Once more, and for the last time, I&#xD;
repeat, where is Ermine ? - what has she&#xD;
done"&#xD;
The answer came in three short words,&#xD;
trenchant as steel, and cold as ice:&#xD;
" She is married."&#xD;
Alan heard, but, as is often the case with&#xD;
some great and sudden shock, scarcely under-.&#xD;
stood the word he repeated. His hand still re-&#xD;
tained its grasp, but through all its sunburnt&#xD;
hue his face grew ashy white, and his eyes&#xD;
opened in startled amazement on his brother.&#xD;
If he had heard that she was dead, he could at&#xD;
least have comprehencaed the height and depth&#xD;
of the calamity ; but now-&#xD;
" Raymond," he said, hoarsely, " what do&#xD;
&#xD;
you mean ? You are mistaken-you don't un-&#xD;
derstand-it is of rmine I am speaking. You&#xD;
dare not tell me that she is-is-"&#xD;
" Married," said Raymond, as coldly and&#xD;
mercilessly as before. Then to himself, " Thank&#xD;
God, it is over !"&#xD;
It was over indeed with Alan. The strong&#xD;
man staggered. back as men stagger under&#xD;
a mortal blow, and sat down in a chair without&#xD;
another word. What, indeed, could he say ?&#xD;
What do any of us say when the stroke of&#xD;
some keen dagger goes home to our hearts ?&#xD;
Raymond stood still and watched him.&#xD;
Even at that moment, he had time to curse the&#xD;
unlucky fate which had failed to bring the&#xD;
letter that would have prepared him for this.&#xD;
Hypocrite as he was, he was not enough of a&#xD;
hypocrite to go forward and put his hand on&#xD;
his brother's shoulder, or to utter any words&#xD;
of condolence or regret. Besides, he was not&#xD;
sure that it might prove safe. There may be&#xD;
death in a lion's claws even after he has got&#xD;
his mortal wound. So he stood watchfully&#xD;
quiet and on guard, till Alan looked up with a&#xD;
face which hardly seemed his own, so drawn&#xD;
and changed was it. Meeting his brother's&#xD;
eyes again, he rose to his feet and confronted&#xD;
him.&#xD;
" Raymond," he said, huskily, "it depends&#xD;
upon one word whether from henceforth we&#xD;
are brothers or mortal enemies. Whom did&#xD;
she "-he could not force his dry tongue to utter&#xD;
her name-" marry? "&#xD;
There was a glance-in his eye, a tone of&#xD;
menace in his voice, that made Raymond Erie&#xD;
hesitate and look round as if for some weapon&#xD;
of defence, before he answered. Finding none,&#xD;
however, he threw back his shoulders and&#xD;
folded his arms defiantly. The worst had&#xD;
come ; through any thing and over any thing&#xD;
the game must be played to its end now.&#xD;
" Alan," he said, trying to speak kiridly,&#xD;
" believe me I am deeply sorry-believd me&#xD;
this never would have occurred if we had not&#xD;
believed-''&#xD;
Alan cut him short - sternly and ~eci-&#xD;
sively.&#xD;
"I want no lying excuses to gloss the&#xD;
truth," he said. " Did she marry you? "&#xD;
"Yes, she married me," Raymond an-&#xD;
swered, thinking that, after all, he bore the&#xD;
revelation with encouraging quietness. "You&#xD;
must let me remind you of one thing," he went&#xD;
on-as his listener stood stunned, quiescent,&#xD;
simply looking at him-" my claim on Ermine&#xD;
&#xD;

likely have deceived you in the matter-"&#xD;
The next instant he found himself planed&#xD;
against the wall, 'r~ith his brother's hand on&#xD;
his throat.&#xD;
"You are an infernal hypocrite and scoun-&#xD;
drel and liar!" said Alan, with his eyes gleam-&#xD;
ing like blue steel. "Do you dare to slander&#xD;
her to me, though you were ten times married&#xD;
to her? The devil only knows by what arts&#xD;
of hell you have gained your point, and gained~&#xD;
her fortune; but, if the same blood were not in&#xD;
our veins, I would kill you where you stand!&#xD;
As it is, I warn you that no law of God or man&#xD;
shall stand between us if so much as one hair&#xD;
of her head has been injured! Now go, like&#xD;
the carri9a that you are! I will find the truth&#xD;
elsewhere."&#xD;
lie lit~ally flung him from his hand, and,&#xD;
leaving him stunned, almost senseless, strode&#xD;
from the office.&#xD;
Outside the door, an eager group was&#xD;
awaiting his appearance. The sight of Nix&#xD;
told the story of his master's return; and&#xD;
round the dog were gathered the book-keeper,&#xD;
the clerks, and two or three outsiders who had&#xD;
heard the news, and were on the qui vise to&#xD;
see the sailor who had been dead and was&#xD;
alive, had been lost and was found. When he&#xD;
came out, half a dozen hands were thrust for-&#xD;
ward at once in cordial welcome-that welcome&#xD;
which not one of his own kindred was likely to&#xD;
give him.&#xD;
Now, Alan was " game" to the backbone,&#xD;
apd so it is scarcely ~aecessary to say that, stag-&#xD;
gering as he yet was under that cruel blow&#xD;
which had been dealt him ~o suddenly and un-&#xD;
expectedly, he gave no outward token of the&#xD;
fact beyond that pallor which sat so strangely&#xD;
on his sunburnt face. He smiled in his old&#xD;
frank, genial fashion-smiled, however, only&#xD;
with the lips, not with the eyes-as he graa~ed&#xD;
one after the other the hands extended to him,&#xD;
saying to each man a few words of cordial&#xD;
thanks.&#xD;
But they did not detain him long. All&#xD;
their hope of hearing some thrilling story of&#xD;
hair-breadth escape was nipped in the bud.&#xD;
Without a discourteous word, or look, or tone,&#xD;
Captain ErIe made them understand that, hav-&#xD;
ing offered their congratulations, they must&#xD;
fall back and let him go his way, free from mo-~&#xD;
lestation.. This they did after first wishinghim&#xD;
with genuine heartiness a merry Christmas in&#xD;
celebration of his return.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Thanks," said he, with a slight, almost&#xD;
imperceptible quiver of the lip. "I have&#xD;
looked forward to this Christmas for many&#xD;
days," he went on, with a vibration of pathos&#xD;
which the ears of his hearers were not suffi-&#xD;
ciently finely-strung to catch. "I hope--I&#xD;
sincerely hope-that it mayprove a happy one&#xD;
to you alL"&#xD;
They murmured their thanks; and, with a&#xD;
bow which each man appropriated as a special&#xD;
compliment to himself, he passed from among&#xD;
them, followed by Nix.&#xD;
Out into the crowded holiday streets he&#xD;
went, out amongthe gay holiday crowd; crowd&#xD;
not so intent upon its business of pleasure, but&#xD;
that many old friends recognized the returned&#xD;
wanderer, and greeted him with &amp;amp;mazcment&#xD;
and delight. roor Alan! Brave as he was,&#xD;
his endurance and seW-control were tried to&#xD;
their utmost within the hour following his de-&#xD;
part&amp;amp;re from the counting-house ivhere he had&#xD;
left his brother. Everybody was overjoyed to&#xD;
see him, everybody was eager to welcQme him&#xD;
back with enthusiasm, and more eager (with&#xD;
natural curiosity) to hear his story. But no.&#xD;
body heard it save in the baldest and barest&#xD;
outline. Courtesy bore him through the or-&#xD;
deal-together with a dull, leaden, yet unreal-&#xD;
ized sense that all was ovcr-bu~ talk atlength&#xD;
he could not. After the first congratulations&#xD;
and inquiries, people felt, as the clerks of ErIe&#xD;
&amp;amp; Co. had already felt, that they were detain-&#xD;
ing a man who was feverishly anxious to ac-&#xD;
complish some end apart from them~ They&#xD;
hoped to see him soon again, and to hear his&#xD;
story, they said; so, bidding him merry Christ-&#xD;
mas, they passed on.&#xD;
Merry Christmas! Ah, happy the heart&#xD;
whose grief has never felt the sting of mockery&#xD;
in those words of peace and good-will, whose&#xD;
leaden heaviness has never been beyond the&#xD;
reach of Christmas smiles and cheer; happy&#xD;
the eyes that have never been t~o thickly&#xD;
blinded by tears to catch a gleam of earth's&#xD;
brightness, or even of that brightness not&#xD;
of earth, which streams from the Manger&#xD;
of Bethlehem; thrice happy the soul for&#xD;
whom no bitter trouble or dust-stained care&#xD;
has ever darkened this most fair and glorious&#xD;
Feast of all the Christian year! Troubleseems&#xD;
twice trouble, grief more than grief, wheutevery&#xD;
voice-human and divine-bids us lift our&#xD;
heavy lids and rejoice. We turn our eyes&#xD;

we forget- 0 hearts of little faith !-what&#xD;
few, short steps, along the bloody Via &amp;amp;ucis,&#xD;
lead from Bethlehem to Calvary, from the&#xD;
new-born King to the crucified God!&#xD;
The words of Christinasgreeting which fell&#xD;
from every lip scarcely jarred on Alan, how-&#xD;
ever-at least not yet. His preoccupationwas&#xD;
too great. Wounded and bleeding as he was,&#xD;
he felt also dizzy. He could not rid himself&#xD;
of the thought that he was going to Ermine-~&#xD;
hi. Ermine-to the meeting for which his&#xD;
faithful heart had yearned, which his faithful&#xD;
fancy had painted, through all these months&#xD;
of absence. Married! He said it over and&#xD;
over to himself; but, say it as often as he would,&#xD;
he could not realize it. He ha~.l not yet realized&#xD;
it when hin footsteps paused on the well-known&#xD;
threshold of the Erie house. There he stopped&#xD;
a~ moment. How could he meet her? What&#xD;
should he say to her? He knew that some&#xD;
black treachery had been at work to make her&#xD;
Beem so bitterly faithless; but, none the less,&#xD;
a gulf had been dug between them which no&#xD;
human power could span. THis Ermine-his&#xD;
pure, spotless lily-had beenwrested from him,&#xD;
and the robber who had done the deed was no&#xD;
man whom he could shoot down like a dog, but&#xD;
his own father's son! Alan was not much&#xD;
more than a savage, as he thought of the cruel&#xD;
and enduring wrong that had been done to the&#xD;
tender and helpless creature whom his supposed&#xD;
death had left unfriended, lie steeled himself&#xD;
against all the tender memories of love (mem-&#xD;
ories which would only have unnerved him),&#xD;
and thought only of the stern duty of yen-&#xD;
seance, when at last he put his hand on the&#xD;
bell, and sent a resounding peal through the&#xD;
house.&#xD;
The servant who opened the door looked&#xD;
so amazed-so utterly aghast-at sight of him,&#xD;
that he remembered for the first time his&#xD;
ghostly character.&#xD;
"It is I, Robin, not a spirit," he said, with&#xD;
~a faint smile. "Don't look so scared ! There,&#xD;
isn't that real?"&#xD;
He held out his hand as he had held it for&#xD;
the same purpose to his brother, and Robin-&#xD;
who had known him from their common boy-&#xD;
hood-seized it in a grasp different indeed from&#xD;
the fraternal one, his whole face changing from&#xD;
amazejnent to delight.&#xD;
"'Fore God, Mass Alan, I'm glad and hap-&#xD;
py to see you back, sir!" h~ said, forgetting&#xD;
his usual decorous "Captain Erie," in the ex-&#xD;
citement of the moment. "I always said there&#xD;
&#xD;
wasn't water deep enough to drown you, sir ~.&#xD;
but we all heard, sir, that you were drowned,&#xD;
and no mistake about it."&#xD;
"I wasn't though, you see-the worse for&#xD;
me, perhaps! Thank yoit for being so glad to&#xD;
see me, Robin. I am not sorry that somebody&#xD;
is glad-l4ere. flow are-all?"&#xD;
"All very well, thank you, sir; but "-&#xD;
Robin hesitated a moment-"but our family&#xD;
is not as large as it was when you left us, Mass&#xD;
Alan."&#xD;
"I suppose not," said Alan, turning away&#xD;
-for he did not wish even a servant to read&#xD;
his face just then. "Is any one in here?" ho&#xD;
went on, walking toward the familiar sitting-&#xD;
room.&#xD;
"No one at all, sir," said Robin, going for.&#xD;
ward to open the door. "Shall I let my mis-&#xD;
tress know that you afe here?"&#xD;
"No-let Miss Ermine know." (He would&#xD;
not say' "Miss St. Amand," and the tortures&#xD;
of the rack could not have drawn the other&#xD;
name from him.)&#xD;
Robin stood motionless-transfixed, as it&#xD;
were, by astonishment-with the doorhandle&#xD;
in his fingers.&#xD;
"Miss Ermine!" he repeated; "I thought&#xD;
you knew, sir. She's-she's married!"&#xD;
"I do know," said Alan, through his set&#xD;
teeth. "All the same~ let her know that I am&#xD;
here."&#xD;
"But she's not here, sir!" said Robin, with&#xD;
his eyes like saucers.&#xD;
It was now Captain Erle's turn to stare.&#xD;
"Not, here!" he repeated. "What do&#xD;
you mean? Where is she, then?"&#xD;
"She's in Mart.ncck, sir," said Robin, with&#xD;
dignity. "Miss Ermine has never been back&#xD;
since she was married."&#xD;
"In Martinique!" Alan was absolutely&#xD;
stunned. "Are you mad?" he asked. "Do&#xD;
you know that-that Raymond Erie is in the&#xD;
city?"&#xD;
"Mr. Raymond came back only last week,&#xD;
sir-and he said he left Miss Ermine quite&#xD;
well, and so pleased with the island she&#xD;
wouldn't leave it. I assure you, sir, she has&#xD;
never been back' since she went away last&#xD;
summer."&#xD;
"Last summer! Where was she mar-&#xD;
ried?"&#xD;
"In New York, sir."&#xD;
There was silence for a long minute-then&#xD;
Captain ErIe walked into the sitting.room,&#xD;
saying, briefly:&#xD;
&#xD;
"Tell Miss Lautrec that I will be glad to&#xD;
seeker."&#xD;
"Miss Lautrec is in Europe, sir," answered&#xD;
Robin, compassionating this wonderful degree&#xD;
of ignorance, yet not insensible to the pleasure&#xD;
of enlightening it-that curious pleasure which&#xD;
the vulgar always feel in telling news either&#xD;
good or bad.&#xD;
"What!" said Alan, facing round in new&#xD;
astonishment.&#xD;
"Miss Lautrec is in Europe, sir," repeated&#xD;
Robin, modestly. "I told you, sir, that the&#xD;
family is a good deal changed. Miss Mar-&#xD;
garet's married, and so is Miss Ermine, and&#xD;
Miss Madelon's gone away."&#xD;
"Is anybody left?" asked Alan, gazing at&#xD;
him in a sort of blank desperation.&#xD;
"M4s. Erle is at home, sir, and Miss&#xD;
Louise, and Mass Regy."&#xD;
"Tell Mrs. Erle that I shall be glad to see&#xD;
her."&#xD;
He said these words almost mechanically,&#xD;
and, as Robin closed the door, he looked&#xD;
round the room, searching wistfully for some&#xD;
token of the presence for which his heart was&#xD;
yearning. Alas! there was not one.' Like&#xD;
the golden May sunshine, that presence had&#xD;
passed away, and the place which knew it&#xD;
once would know it never again.&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
THE TRUTH ELSEWHERE.&#xD;
ROBIN'S announcement to his mistress, that&#xD;
Captain Erie-" Mass Alan that we heard was&#xD;
drownede, xna'am "-desired to see her, proved&#xD;
by no means the shock which he had doubt.&#xD;
less anticipated. He had not been in the&#xD;
secret of a note which was brought to the&#xD;
house by a panting messenger and delivered&#xD;
into Mrs. Erie's own hand, half an hour be-&#xD;
fore. The first use which Raymond had made&#xD;
of his recovered senses was to scribble three&#xD;
lines of warning to Ermine's mother:&#xD;
"Alan has turned up, as you prophesied,&#xD;
and received the news like a 'madman. He&#xD;
will come to you for particulars. For God's&#xD;
sake, take care what you say to him!&#xD;
"R. B."&#xD;
Thus warned-thus given half an hour for&#xD;
reflection-Mrs. Erie, who was a born Talley.&#xD;
rand in petticoats-felt justified in considering&#xD;
&#xD;
herself fully equal to the emergency. She&#xD;
went downstairs with her mind fully made up&#xD;
concerning every word she meant to titter. A&#xD;
distrust of her own diplomatic address did&#xD;
not once occur to her, for she had known Alan&#xD;
of old as entirely so belonging to that class&#xD;
of men who ar~ like wax in a clever woman's&#xD;
handsthat she had no doubt of finding him&#xD;
plastic under her fingers. "Men are so&#xD;
clumsy," she thought to herself; in that scorn&#xD;
with which women often repay the cool superi-&#xD;
ority of the stronger sex; and, so thinking,&#xD;
entered the sitting-room with one hand ex-&#xD;
tended in cordial welcome-now, as ever, the&#xD;
stately and gracious lady whom Alan well re-&#xD;
membered.&#xD;
"My dear Alan, this is a most unexpected&#xD;
pleasure 1" she said, in the old, clear, well-&#xD;
modulated voice, which somehow seemed to&#xD;
him now to have a metallic ring. "I cannot&#xD;
tell you how happy I am to see you back&#xD;
again-alive and well! It has been su~h a&#xD;
long time since your shipwreck that we had&#xD;
almost surrendered all hope of your escape.&#xD;
It is true, Istill trusted that you might return;&#xD;
but then a woman is more influenced by her&#xD;
own wishes than by reason, you know. Have&#xD;
you only just arrived?" (This, with a glance&#xD;
itt his costume.)&#xD;
Alan looked at a small French clock over&#xD;
the mantel before~which he stood.&#xD;
"I landed two hours ago," he answered,&#xD;
briefly-and, as he said it, he stopped a mo-&#xD;
ment to wonder if it was only two hours.&#xD;
k~"Indced! How kind of you to come at&#xD;
ones" said Mrs. Erie, still graceful, still cor-&#xD;
diaL "Of course, you are going to stay with&#xD;
us" (He had never done such a thing be-&#xD;
fore; and it was strange, to say the least, that&#xD;
she should imagine hL~ likely to do it now.)&#xD;
"Will you go to your room at once, or will&#xD;
you sit down"-(she drew a chair forward)-&#xD;
"and let me hear the story of your escape?&#xD;
I am sure it must be thrilling."&#xD;
Now, next to his brother, Alan Erle's heart&#xD;
*as hardest toward this woman-this smiling,&#xD;
courteous model of elegant propriety-and he&#xD;
felt no inclination to spare her one of the bit-'&#xD;
ter truths burning within him. He frowned a&#xD;
little as she drew forward the chair. Uncom-&#xD;
promising Arabian that he was in all his ideas&#xD;
of hospitality, it would have gone hard with&#xD;
him to accept even a seat under his enemy's&#xD;
roof.&#xD;
"If you will allow me to stand, I should&#xD;
&#xD;
p&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC8067-00000036"/>&#xD;
prefer to do so," said he, courteously but&#xD;
coldly. "I shall not detain you many min-&#xD;
utes. I did not come to claim your congratu-&#xD;
lations on my escape-~which, just now, God&#xD;
knows, I cannot consider very fortunate-but&#xD;
to ask you a few plain questions. Few as&#xD;
~they arc, however, I must beg you not to let&#xD;
me detain you standing while I ask them."&#xD;
"I am not in the habit of sitting while my&#xD;
guests remain standing," said Mrs. Erie, with&#xD;
dignity. "If your questions relate to my&#xD;
daughter," she went on, "I shall be happy to&#xD;
answer them; although" (she~ emphasized&#xD;
this), "I do not recognize that you have any&#xD;
right to ask them."&#xD;
"No right!" he repeated. Steeled as he&#xD;
was against the rebuff which he had expected,&#xD;
the blood rushed over his cheek and brow at&#xD;
this cool retraction of the pledge once given&#xD;
him in that very room. "No right!" he said&#xD;
again. "Allow me to ask if you have forgot.&#xD;
ten that I had the honor to be engaged to&#xD;
your daughter with your own consent?"&#xD;
"With my sufferance," quietly corrected&#xD;
Mrs. ErIe. "'If you will do me the justice to&#xD;
remember, I merely tolerated the engagement&#xD;
until Ermine's guardian could be communicated&#xD;
with. I have every reason to believe that&#xD;
Colonel Vivicux would have regarded the&#xD;
affair exactly as I did; and therefore any one&#xD;
would hold me justified in considering that no&#xD;
actual engagement ever existed. A foolish&#xD;
love-affair is quite a different thing. This was&#xD;
the view which I forcibly represented to Er-&#xD;
mine before her marriage."&#xD;
"And found a willing listener, apparent-&#xD;
ly!" said Allan, bitterly.&#xD;
Yet the words were hardly spoken before&#xD;
he repented them, and, true as the needle to&#xD;
themagnet, his heart flew back to its allegiance.&#xD;
No I Let circumstances say what they would,&#xD;
let the whole world say what it would, he&#xD;
defied any or all of them to shake his faith in&#xD;
the gentle creature ivho had ever been to him&#xD;
so "tender and true." Is it Dc Maistre who&#xD;
says that~ mankind should be divided into two&#xD;
classes, "Ic chat et le chien?" Certainly&#xD;
Alan had much of the canine nature in his&#xD;
stubborn, dogged fidelity. There was in him&#xD;
no making of an Othello. A thousand hand-&#xD;
kerchiefs would not have shaken his trust in&#xD;
the woman he loved. They had played him&#xD;
false, they had wronged her deeply, they had&#xD;
parted them forever; but, none the less, she&#xD;
still remained firm on her pedestal, a pure,&#xD;
&#xD;
faithful, passionate woman, who might be be-&#xD;
trayed, but who could never betray.&#xD;
"My daughter proved herself amenable to&#xD;
reason," answered Mrs. Erie, coldly. "I should&#xD;
have been exceedingly disappointed in her if&#xD;
she had not done so."&#xD;
"Did she prove herself amenable to reason&#xD;
or compulsion 1"' asked Alan, striving hard&#xD;
fdr self-control. "Knowing Ermine as long&#xD;
and as well as I have done, I cannot believe-&#xD;
and, by the God who will judge me, I do not&#xD;
believe-that she acted in such a manner of&#xD;
her own free will and choice 1"&#xD;
Mrs. Erie drew herself up haughtily.&#xD;
"When I agreed to answer your questions,&#xD;
I should, have made a reservation that they&#xD;
should be sufficiently respectful to be worthy&#xD;
of attention," she said. "Since you have&#xD;
known Ermine so long and so well, you might&#xD;
also have known her stubborn and intractable&#xD;
disposition. Will you tell me how I should'&#xD;
have set about exercising 'compulsion' Qvcr&#xD;
a self-willed girl whom the law emancipated&#xD;
from every shadow of my control?"&#xD;
"There are many modes of compulsion&#xD;
besides those of' which the law takes cogni-&#xD;
zance," said Alan, bitterly, "in all of which&#xD;
you, madam, are, I am sure, an able proficient.&#xD;
At least you cannot deny that it has always&#xD;
been your wish that your daughter should&#xD;
marry my brother."&#xD;
"I have no intention of denying it," said.&#xD;
Mrs. Erie, speaking still with haughty dignity.&#xD;
"My daughter has always been a source of&#xD;
great anxiety to me, and I have always desired&#xD;
to see her happily married to some man wh~&#xD;
could bear patiently with, and yet firmly con-&#xD;
trol, her wayward fancies. Your brother is&#xD;
such a man, and his suit received from the&#xD;
first my *armest sanction."&#xD;
"Yet you were kind enough to give this&#xD;
same sanction to my engagement."&#xD;
"Pardon me" (she made an ineffable, and&#xD;
as it seemed, inexpressible gesture of scorn),&#xD;
"I gave only my tolerance to that. To have&#xD;
given more would have been impossible-yet,&#xD;
under the circumstances, I could not give&#xD;
less."&#xD;
"And these circumstances were ?"&#xD;
"The' fact that I was not Ermine's&#xD;
guardian."&#xD;
"You were her mother."&#xD;
"Yes, I was her mother," said Mrs. Erle,&#xD;
with one single flask of her clear, hazel eyes-&#xD;
the scabbards had been thrown away before&#xD;
4f&#xD;
&#xD;
EBB-TIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
I'&#xD;
&#xD;
EBB-TIDE.                                                         THE TRUTH ELSEWHERE.&#xD;
&#xD;
this, and for the first (and last) time, the&#xD;
naked swords of these two combatants&#xD;
clashed blade against blade-" and, as her&#xD;
mother, I felt deeply disappointed and deeply&#xD;
wounded by her choice."&#xD;
Alan suddenly raised his hand to his face.&#xD;
He did not choose that his adversary should&#xD;
see how the strong, white teeth involuntarily&#xD;
went deep into his lip under the shade of the&#xD;
heavily-fringing mustache. Even when he&#xD;
spoke-and that was after a minute-his voice&#xD;
shook a little.&#xD;
"And may I venture to ask if Colonel&#xD;
Vivicux agreed with you in your view of the&#xD;
engagement?"&#xD;
Mrs. Erie looked at him a little curiously-&#xD;
this savage of the sea, who seemed in utter ig.&#xD;
norance1of facts long since grown old and stale&#xD;
to the dwellers of the land.&#xD;
"Colonel Vivicux never heard of the affair&#xD;
at all," she answered. "He was dead before&#xD;
the news of it reached Martinique."&#xD;
Alan passed his hand over his eyes. He&#xD;
felt like one who, having waked from sleep,&#xD;
begins to recall some dormant recollection.&#xD;
"I had forgotten that Ermine's first letter&#xD;
contained the news of her guardian's death,"&#xD;
he said aloud. Then in a lower tone: "My&#xD;
poor darling! so you had not even one friend&#xD;
to fight your battle for you!"&#xD;
There was silence after this for several&#xD;
seconds. Standing strictly on the defensive,&#xD;
it was no part of Mrs. Erie's policy to speak&#xD;
first, and Alan shrank nervously-shrank "like&#xD;
a woman," as he indignantly thought to him-&#xD;
self-from opening the immediate subject of&#xD;
the marriage. At last, however, he steeled&#xD;
himself and spoke.&#xD;
"Will you allow me to inquire the date of&#xD;
Miss St. Amand's marriage?"&#xD;
"The 15th ~f November," answered Mrs.&#xD;
Erie, briefly.&#xD;
"And may I also ask when she heard the&#xD;
news of my shipwreck ~&#xD;
"As well as I remember, it was somewhere&#xD;
about the middle of October."&#xD;
"And did she accept the fact of my death&#xD;
at once, or did she require a little time to&#xD;
verify it?"&#xD;
"She accepted it at once," said~ Mrs. Erie,&#xD;
decidedly, "especially after she had seen the&#xD;
sailor-your mate, I think-who escaped."&#xD;
At these words, the scarlet blood rushed&#xD;
in a tide over Alan's face.&#xD;
"She saw that cowardly dog!" he said.&#xD;
&#xD;
~C She took the account of my death from 1dm!&#xD;
My God, madam, if it hadn't been for that man,&#xD;
none of my poor fellows would have been lost,&#xD;
and I myself should not have needed to be&#xD;
save(I almost as it were by a miracle I" He&#xD;
said this passionately-then stopped, and the&#xD;
blood died down again." My story will not in-&#xD;
terest you," l~e went on; "so I will not weary&#xD;
you with it. I came home full of hope and faith&#xD;
and happiness-all of which one hour has end-&#xD;
ecl. But I have something yet to do. I have&#xD;
to hear the truth of her marriage from Ermine's&#xD;
own lips, and to right her, wherever or how.&#xD;
ever she has been wronged. This is my work;&#xD;
and for this I shall always believe that God&#xD;
brought me back to life out of the jaws of&#xD;
death."&#xD;
The concentrated passion and resolve of&#xD;
his two last sentences seemed to move Mrs.&#xD;
Erle a little. She looked at him, a there&#xD;
was a slight whitening about the lips, which&#xD;
betrayed that she felt some emotion when he&#xD;
mentioned Ermine's name.&#xD;
"I waive any notice of the insult which&#xD;
your suspicions are to me," she said. "For&#xD;
the gratification of my curiosity, I should like&#xD;
to know what you suspect. Who could have&#xD;
wronged Ermine ?-.-or what interest do you&#xD;
imagine that I, her mother, could have had in&#xD;
suffering her to be wronged?&#xD;
Alan replied by taking from the inner&#xD;
pocket of his coat a very battered.looking&#xD;
pocket-book of Russia leather. From this he&#xD;
extracted several letters, discolored with salt-&#xD;
water, and handed to Mrs. Erie.&#xD;
"Will you look at these, madam," he said,&#xD;
"and will you judge whether I am likely to&#xD;
credit that the woman who wrote these letters&#xD;
-the woman whom I have known from her&#xD;
childhood as the most faithful of God's&#xD;
creatures-could willingly have married an-&#xD;
other man in less then a month after she heard&#xD;
of my supposed death?"&#xD;
Mrs. ErIe declined the letters by a gesture.&#xD;
She had no sentimental weakness about the&#xD;
matter; but it would have been exceedingly&#xD;
disagreeable to her to read the words of pas-&#xD;
sionate affection addressed by her daughter.&#xD;
to this man whom she hated as much as it was&#xD;
in her to hate anybody.&#xD;
"Such evidence as this is apart from the&#xD;
question entirely," she said. "I decline to&#xD;
read the record of a folly which my daughter&#xD;
has happily outlived. Your obstinacy," she&#xD;
went on," compels me to assure you that if you&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC8067-00000037"/>&#xD;
had not been shipwrecked-if your voyagehad&#xD;
been successfully accomplished-you would&#xD;
not have found Ermine the foolish girl you left&#xD;
her."'&#xD;
"You mean-?"&#xD;
"I mean that she had begun to appreciate&#xD;
life a little better, and to learn-what many&#xD;
another woman has learned before-that her&#xD;
first matrimonial choice was a very unwise&#xD;
one."&#xD;
"In other words," said Alan, with deter-&#xD;
mined calmness, "you assert that she was pre-&#xD;
pared to break her engagement whether I&#xD;
proved to be dead or alive?"&#xD;
"Since you prefer to put it plainly," said&#xD;
Mrs. Erie, with decided dignity, "I confess&#xD;
that I am prepared to assert and to maintain&#xD;
that fact."&#xD;
"Then, madam,'~ said he, curtly, "you com-&#xD;
pel me to decide between your assertion and&#xD;
my knowledge of your daughter. When Er-&#xD;
mine assures me of such a fact with her own&#xD;
lips, I shall believe it-not before!"&#xD;
The lady flushed a little, enough to show&#xD;
that she felt the full meaning of his words.&#xD;
"Mindful as I am of the excitement under&#xD;
which you are laboring," she said, with stately&#xD;
1~auteur, "it is impossible for me to endure&#xD;
such a conversation as this much longer. Will&#xD;
you be kind enough to end it, or shall I be&#xD;
forced to leave the room?"&#xD;
"I am sorry to have inflicted my society&#xD;
upon you even for these few minutes," he an-&#xD;
swered. "I should be still more sorry to inflict&#xD;
it upon you any longer. With one-more ques-&#xD;
tion, I am done. Will you tell me why Miss&#xD;
St. Amand was not married in Charleston?"&#xD;
"That is easily answered," said Mrs. Erie,&#xD;
coldly. "We had been spending the summer in&#xD;
Canada, and since it was necessary thatErmine&#xD;
shOuld go to Martinique to look after her prop-&#xD;
erty-Colonel Vivicux being dead-we con-&#xD;
cluded that it would be better to hasten the&#xD;
marriage so that she could sail at once from&#xD;
New York."&#xD;
Alan answered nothing. What could he&#xD;
- say to such reasons es these? They looked&#xD;
plausible enough on the outside, but a voice&#xD;
within him cried, "False, false, false!"&#xD;
"I regret not being able to see Miss Lau-&#xD;
tree," he said, at last. - "I had hoped-very&#xD;
much hoped-to meet her."&#xD;
"Madelon also left us in New York," said&#xD;
Mrs. ErIe. "An opportunity offered, and she&#xD;
sailed for Havre, intending to spend some time&#xD;
&#xD;
with her relations in France. By a chance1&#xD;
iher departure was given in the same paper&#xD;
which published Ermine's marriage.&#xD;
She crossed the floor, and, opening a small&#xD;
secretary, took from it a newspaper. Return-&#xD;
ing, she pointed out two paragraphs to Alan.&#xD;
One was the marriage of Ermine H~l~ne St.&#xD;
Amand to Raymond ErIe; the other, thename&#xD;
of Miss Lautrec in a list of passengers who had&#xD;
sailed for Havre in the steamer Golden Bells.&#xD;
Thinking at the time merely of the paragraphs&#xD;
in question, it was not until afterward that&#xD;
the manner in which the paper had been re-&#xD;
tained and brought forward struck Alan as a&#xD;
little singular.&#xD;
When he laid it down, Mrs. ErIe saw that&#xD;
the interview was at an end. He turned to go,&#xD;
and his last words~-being indeed the very last&#xD;
that were ever spoken between them-were&#xD;
such as she was not likely to forget.&#xD;
"I came to you for the turth, madam," he&#xD;
said. "I have obtained only evasion. But&#xD;
this I beg you to remember-Iwill kane 1/sat&#xD;
trutls. I resign my profession, I put aside&#xD;
every aim and object of my life, until I shall&#xD;
explore this mystery-for mystery it is to me&#xD;
-to the bottom. And I warn you-Ermine's&#xD;
mother-as I have already warned the man&#xD;
who calls himself her husband, that, when the&#xD;
day of reckoning comes, I will return a&#xD;
hundredfold, upon those who have wronged&#xD;
her, every pang which she may have suffered,&#xD;
and every tear which she may have shed!"&#xD;
She did not answer. With those passionate&#xD;
words still vibrating on the air, he turned and&#xD;
left the room.&#xD;
-4--&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
"GO TO MAIiTINIQUE!"&#xD;
"ALAN I Is it possible this is you!"&#xD;
These words, accompanied bya half-startled&#xD;
cry, fell on Captain Erie's ;ears as he was&#xD;
making his way, with an apathetic disregard of&#xD;
the comfort of other people, through a crowd&#xD;
which jammed the sidewalk almost to suffoca-&#xD;
tion before a large fancy establishment on King&#xD;
Street. He turned sharply-wondering a little&#xD;
who would be likely to call his name in that&#xD;
familiar tone-and faced a beautiful, golden-&#xD;
haired woman who, followed by a servant with&#xD;
his arms full of bundles, was stepping across&#xD;
the pavement to her carriage. The color had&#xD;
&#xD;
EBB-TIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
fled from her cheeks, and her turquoise eyes&#xD;
expanded with amazement, almost with flight,&#xD;
as she looked at him. As he turned, she put&#xD;
out one daintily-gloved hand and touched his&#xD;
sleeve.&#xD;
"Alan!" she gasped, rather than said. "Is&#xD;
it-is it you?"&#xD;
"Of course it is," answered Alan, recogniz-&#xD;
ing her in a moment. "My dear Margaret,&#xD;
don't look so frightened! It is I, in veritable&#xD;
flesh and blood; and very glad lam to see you&#xD;
again. Must I congratulate you on having&#xD;
changed your name and estate?" he went on,&#xD;
taking her hand and looking at her with a&#xD;
smile. She was of his own kindred, and she,&#xD;
at least, had done nothing to wrong him. Why&#xD;
should he not smile and be honestly glad to&#xD;
see her? /&#xD;
Instead of answering his question, however,&#xD;
Margaret, according to her old habit, burst into&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
"0 Alan! Alan!" she cried, "they ~told&#xD;
me you were dead!"&#xD;
"Instead of that, however, you see that I&#xD;
am alive," answered he, considerablyastonished&#xD;
by this unexpected display of emotion. "My&#xD;
dear cousin, let me put you into your car-&#xD;
riage," he continued, as he saw how the scene&#xD;
w1~s drawing an interested crowd around them.&#xD;
"You almost make me think that you are dis-&#xD;
tressed to find me alive!" be said, with a&#xD;
smiling attempt to quiet her, as he drew her&#xD;
hand within his arm, and led her to the car-&#xD;
riage.&#xD;
"No, no!" cried Margaret, with a tragic&#xD;
emphasis' which amazed him. "God knows&#xD;
how glad I am, Alan-how truly, honestly glad&#xD;
-to see you back in safety. I 'would have&#xD;
done any thing sooner than-than been glad&#xD;
that you were dead." -&#xD;
"Indeed, I should really hope so," said he,&#xD;
smiling again. "What possible reason could&#xD;
I l~ave for suspectingyou of such an enormity?&#xD;
Are your bundles all in safety? Yes, that's&#xD;
right! Now tell me where you live, so that I&#xD;
can come to see you soon, and good-by."&#xD;
He put out his hand. But the words had&#xD;
not left his lips before Margaret interposed&#xD;
eagerly:&#xD;
"No, you must come with me now. I am&#xD;
sure you are not going anywhere-at least&#xD;
anywhere that matters. Come, Alan-I in-&#xD;
sist upon it! I have so pinch to say to you."'&#xD;
He hesitated; but, as she had said, he was&#xD;
not going anywhere that mattered, and he felt&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
EBB-TIDE.                                                         "GO TO MARTINIQUE!"&#xD;
&#xD;
in that mood of recklessness when one is glad&#xD;
to escape from the society of one's self into&#xD;
any other whatever. Besides, she was his cous-&#xD;
in, and she was glad to see him. His heart-.&#xD;
yearning for hopeless affection-caught even&#xD;
at this.&#xD;
"Really, Margaret," he began, wavering&#xD;
and evasive.&#xD;
But Margaret swept aside her silken skirts,&#xD;
and beckoned him imperiously into the car-&#xD;
riage.&#xD;
"Come!,' she said. "You must come; I&#xD;
will take no denial. What! risen from the&#xD;
dead, as it were, and leave me like this!&#xD;
Come!"&#xD;
Her 'feverish anxiety influenced him,&#xD;
whether he would or no. He entered the car-&#xD;
riage, the footman closed the door, and they&#xD;
rolled away.&#xD;
Then the crowd began to chatter! Heaven&#xD;
only knows how many different versions and&#xD;
interpretations of the scene flew from lip to lip,&#xD;
the favorite rendition being a modified form&#xD;
of "Add Robin Gray."&#xD;
"Did you hear about Margaret ErIe?"&#xD;
people asked each other. "You know every-&#xD;
body said she married Mr. Sexton against her&#xD;
will, while she was really in love with that&#xD;
cousin of hers who turned sailor, and was&#xD;
drowned, or reported to be drowned at sea.&#xD;
Well, it was all true enough. On Christmas.&#xD;
Eve she suddenly met him-the cousin, I&#xD;
mean-just as she was coming out of Guth-&#xD;
ne's, and, right before everybody, she* went&#xD;
off at once into hysterics, assuring him she&#xD;
would never have married if she had not&#xD;
thought he was dead!"&#xD;
The subjects of this bit of popular history&#xD;
-then in active course of preparation-had&#xD;
meanwhile stopped before an "elegant man-&#xD;
sion" (that is the correct term for a comfort-&#xD;
able house, I believe), into which Captain Erle&#xD;
followed his cousin. The mAnsion in question&#xD;
was elegant within as well as without; and the&#xD;
sailor, fresh from the sea, could not but be&#xD;
struck by the judicious manner in which the&#xD;
ethereal inspiration of poets and painters had&#xD;
in the end feathered her nest.&#xD;
"I am inclined to think that, after all, Mar-&#xD;
garet, you made a wise choice," he said, a lit-&#xD;
tle sardonically, as he was led into a dim,&#xD;
flower-scented, rose-hung, mirror-embellished&#xD;
room which Mrs. Sexton called her boudoir,&#xD;
and inducted into a chair that might have&#xD;
tempted an anchorite to repose. "Love&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC8067-00000038"/>&#xD;
sometimes flies through the window," pursued&#xD;
the cynic, "but statues, and mirrors, and&#xD;
French furniture, are not disturbed by any&#xD;
such freaks of passion. One's heart might&#xD;
break, but a chair like this would be a com-&#xD;
fort all the same."&#xD;
"I am not so sure of that," said Margaret,&#xD;
laying aside her bonnet, and sinking into a&#xD;
corresponding chair, with her wealth of amber&#xD;
hair crowning her like the halo of a saint.&#xD;
"Sometimes I would not care if it all did fly&#xD;
through the window," she went on. "Some-&#xD;
times, Alan, I can't help thinking that I have&#xD;
paid a little too dear for-for every thing."&#xD;
"What do you mean?" asked Alan,&#xD;
bluntly. "Didn't you choose your husband&#xD;
of your own free will? That being the case,&#xD;
what right have you to complain because&#xD;
your bargain may not be exactly to your&#xD;
taste?"&#xD;
"My own free will 1" repeated Margaret,&#xD;
scornfully. "I wonder when a man-a man&#xD;
like ~you-ever comprehends that a woman's&#xD;
free will, from her cradle to her grave, means&#xD;
less than nothing? 'No right to complain!'&#xD;
I don't complain, I'd die before I would com-&#xD;
plain. My husband is good and kind to me-&#xD;
kinder by far than I deserve-but none the&#xD;
less I suffer more than you would believe if I&#xD;
were fool enough to tell you!"&#xD;
Tears rose to her eyes-hot, angry, scorch-&#xD;
ing tears; but she choked them back. Life&#xD;
was beginning to teach even this spoiled but-&#xD;
terfly a little self-control, and the wisdom&#xD;
which is learned only by experience. Alan's&#xD;
heart-always a tender heart to the distress&#xD;
of women or children - was touched, lie&#xD;
leaned forward and took the hand with which&#xD;
she has just dashed away one or two briny&#xD;
drops.&#xD;
"Forgive mc if I spoke roughly," he said.&#xD;
"God knows I am the last man in the world&#xD;
to jest at scars, when I carry within my own&#xD;
heart a gaping wound. Come, Gretta "-this&#xD;
had been his name for her when she was a&#xD;
child, and she had n&amp;amp;t heard it since-" you&#xD;
used to be fond of me long ago, and, although&#xD;
of late years you have ou't'grown all the fond-&#xD;
ness and acquired instead a considerable de-&#xD;
gree of shame for your sailor-cousin, I am&#xD;
sure you still know that I can be trusted.&#xD;
T~I1 me your troubles-it will be some relief&#xD;
tp"you-and let me see if, two heads being&#xD;
better ~than one, we cannot find a remedy for&#xD;
them."&#xD;
&#xD;
To his surprise, Margaret drew her hand&#xD;
quickly away from him, and shrank-.-nervous.&#xD;
ly shrank - into the depths of her chair.&#xD;
"Don't, Alan-don't!" she gasped, rather&#xD;
than said. "I-cannot!"&#xD;
"You mean you can't talk of them?"&#xD;
"Yes, I mean that. I can't talk of them&#xD;
-at least not to ~iou."&#xD;
"Better talk of them to me than to any&#xD;
one else, Margaret. I would hold your confi-&#xD;
dence sacred."&#xD;
"And you think nobody else likely to do&#xD;
so? ~Vcll" (with a sigh), "you are right!&#xD;
You must not think that I have any complaint&#xD;
to make of my husband," she went on, with&#xD;
an eagerness which surprised him. "He is&#xD;
devoted to me-much more so than I deserve,&#xD;
as I cannot help thinking when I remember&#xD;
that I married him caring no more for him&#xD;
than for that dog of yours!"&#xD;
"But you care for him now?"&#xD;
"Yes, I care more fo~ him now," answered&#xD;
she, a little doubtfully. "He gives me every&#xD;
thing in the world I want, and is as kind as he&#xD;
can be; but-but-"&#xD;
Here the turquoise eye~ filled up with&#xD;
tears again, while Alan's face grew hard. He&#xD;
began to suspect that his cousin's heart&#xD;
was still yearning after the accomplished gen-&#xD;
tleman whom he had the honor of calling&#xD;
brother&#xD;
"M~rgaret," he said, sternly, " I know you&#xD;
once h~d a foolish fancy for-for-" he hesi-&#xD;
tated, struggled d with himself, finally wrenched&#xD;
the wo~ds out, and fairly flung them at her-&#xD;
"for m~ brother'; but it is impossible that you&#xD;
can stilt waste a thought on such a scoundrel!&#xD;
If so-'~&#xD;
An ~inexpectcd gesture from Margaret in-&#xD;
terrupt~d him here. Her eyes blazed through&#xD;
the tea~s which had welled into them, and she&#xD;
suddenly brought one foot down with an un-&#xD;
mistakable stamp on the carpet&#xD;
"He is a scoundrel!" she said. "Thank&#xD;
you, Alan, for calling him so. No, I would&#xD;
tear my heart out sooner than-than care for&#xD;
him! lie has poisoned my life for me-that is&#xD;
what he has done! It was bad enough while&#xD;
I thought you were dead," she went on, with&#xD;
passionately-clasped hands and a strangely-&#xD;
excited face, "but now-now-oh, I don't&#xD;
know what to do 1"&#xD;
She broke down in this way with another&#xD;
burst of tears, and Alan-.after looking at her&#xD;
silently for a moment-rose, came to her side,&#xD;
&#xD;
74&#xD;

EBB-TIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
'74                        EBB-TIDE.                                                            "GO TO MARTINIQUE!"                  '7 a&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
and laid one sunburnt hand down on her&#xD;
silken-clad shoulder.&#xD;
"Doat, Alan-don't!" she said, shrinking&#xD;
away from his touch, as she had shrunk be-&#xD;
fore. "I-did not mean any thing!"&#xD;
"Yes, you did mean something," said Alan,&#xD;
in a low, determined voice. "Margaret, look&#xD;
at me-I insist upon it! You won't? Well,&#xD;
then, listen to mc at least. You know some-&#xD;
thing about Er mine-and I charge you, for&#xD;
your soul's sake, to tell it to me instantly!"&#xD;
"Why should you think I know any thing&#xD;
about Ermine? What is Ermine to me?"&#xD;
she asked, still without looking up. "I-I&#xD;
never liked her. You know we never got on&#xD;
well together."&#xD;
"I won't stop to ask whose fault that was,"&#xD;
he answered, in a tone that fairly awed her, it&#xD;
was so grave and stern. "But this I see&#xD;
plainly-you know the truth about Ermine's&#xD;
marriage, and you must tell me at once what&#xD;
it is-what it was!"&#xD;
"Why do you come to me with such a de-&#xD;
mand?" she cried, drawing herself away from&#xD;
his hand. "Why not go to Ermine's mother&#xD;
or to-to her husband?"&#xD;
"I have seen them both," he answered,&#xD;
"and found them as false as false can be.&#xD;
Margaret, you are my last h'pe-here, at&#xD;
least. Tell me the truth, for God's sake1 and&#xD;
you will never regret it."&#xD;
But, as he made the a4uration, he saw  4&#xD;
how-hopeless it was. His influence, and the I&#xD;
influence of her own conscience, were both I&#xD;
but weak and faint compared to the influ-&#xD;
ences which had ~~uled and fashioned her&#xD;
whole life, and which still held their sway,&#xD;
almost, if not quite, as strong as ever. Let her I&#xD;
inclinations be what they would toward hon-&#xD;
esty and truth, Raymond still stood like a lion&#xD;
in her path. She might talk of hating him, I&#xD;
but his spell had been laid upon her for good&#xD;
or for ill, and she was now, as ever, his obedi-&#xD;
ent slave. r&#xD;
"I can tell you nothing," she cried out,&#xD;
passionately. "What is there to tell? For&#xD;
Heaven's sake, let me alone! What is Er- I&#xD;
mine to me, and what is she to ~,iou, now? I I&#xD;
should think you would hate and despise her."&#xD;
"Then you know very little of her, and a&#xD;
still' less of me," he answered. "She is every I&#xD;
thing to me now, and she will be every thing&#xD;
to me till I die. I know that there has been v&#xD;
foul play in this marriage, because I know&#xD;
that she is the most tender and faithful of s&#xD;
&#xD;
God's creatures-utterly incapable of betray-&#xD;
ing any trust once given to her. . There is no-&#xD;
fear that I will not find out the truth sooner&#xD;
or later," he went on; "for I have already-&#xD;
devoted to the task every energy which I pos-&#xD;
sess; but I am sure that you can help mc,&#xD;
Margaret, and I trust that you wilL"&#xD;
"No, I cannot hel~i you," said Margaret,.&#xD;
"except "-and here she looked at him witlt&#xD;
suddenly shining eyes-" I can tell you this:&#xD;
if you want the truth-yo to 2lfartinique/"&#xD;
Now, Alan had already made up his mind&#xD;
to go to Martinique, but the tone of this recom-&#xD;
mendation seemed suddenly to fill him with&#xD;
vague apprehensions. Most of us have known&#xD;
what such apprehensions are, most of us have'&#xD;
known how an accent, a look, is sometimes&#xD;
more darkly suggestive of unknown terror than&#xD;
any spoken words could be.&#xD;
"Margaret," he said, quickly, "for God's&#xD;
sake tell me what you mean! Has any thing&#xD;
befallen Ermine? What have they dared to-&#xD;
do to her? Speak, if you have any mercy!&#xD;
Don't leave me to torture myself with every&#xD;
black fear that love can suggest!"&#xD;
"Ermine was very well when I saw her-&#xD;
last," said Margaret, a little sullenly. "If&#xD;
any thing hqs befallen her, it has been since&#xD;
then."&#xD;
"And when did you see her last?"&#xD;
"I parted from them all in New York, in.&#xD;
l~ctober. Mr. Sexton was anxious to come&#xD;
Lioine, while they decided to remain there for&#xD;
bhe marriage."&#xD;
"You were not at the marriage?'~&#xD;
"Then why do you advise me to go to Mar-.&#xD;
~inique?"&#xD;
"I thought you wanted. the truth," said.&#xD;
~Iargaret, looking steadilyand studiously away'&#xD;
~om him.&#xD;
"I do want it, and" (with an emphasis&#xD;
rhich sheneverforgot), "by the Goclwhomade-&#xD;
ne, Iwill have it!"&#xD;
"Well," said she, with something of the&#xD;
ame glance which he had noticed before in&#xD;
icr usually languid odalisk eyes, "it is to-&#xD;
~Eartinique that you must go to look for it."&#xD;
"But you will not condemn me to days~&#xD;
nd weeks of suspense, when a word from your&#xD;
ips could end it I" said he, passionatelyr&#xD;
'You will not send me to Martinique to learx~&#xD;
~hat you could tell me here and now?"&#xD;
"I have nothing to tell you," she aii~&#xD;
werecL&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC8067-00000039"/>&#xD;
EBB-TIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"'But, Margaret-"&#xD;
'"I know nothing!" she repeated, facing&#xD;
round upon him suddenly. " How should I?&#xD;
Do you think Raymond is likely to take me&#xD;
into his confidence ? Leave me alone ! I am&#xD;
-sorry that I brought you here to torment ane&#xD;
like this !"&#xD;
"And I am sorry that I came,"' he said.&#xD;
'You have, if possible, given an added weight&#xD;
to the anxiety which is already wellnighecrush-&#xD;
ing me."&#xD;
He sat down again in the chair from which&#xD;
he had risen, and almost unconsciously his&#xD;
head sank into his hands. Strong man as he&#xD;
was-strong, indeed, in a higher sense than&#xD;
-the mere physical-something like a deadly&#xD;
faintness came over him. If the shadow of&#xD;
mystery looked so black, who could say how&#xD;
much blacker the reality might prove ?&#xD;
As for Margaret, she sat still and looked at&#xD;
him; sorry for him somewhat, but sorry for&#xD;
herself still inore ; lacking courage to be silent,&#xD;
lacking yet more the courage to speak. After&#xD;
-all, she was of a very commonplace type, by&#xD;
no means wholly bad, yet assuredly by no&#xD;
"means wholly good. After a fashion, she was&#xD;
capable of friendship, gratitude, and love ; after&#xD;
a fashion also, of hatred, enmity, and revenge.&#xD;
But her love would never have been equal to a&#xD;
sacrifice, and her revenge would have always&#xD;
-taken the form of petty malice. Of any thing&#xD;
positive her nature was literally incapable.&#xD;
She had not strength of character sufficient to&#xD;
proclaim her cognizance of a guilty scheme,&#xD;
and yet she had enough of a conscience to be&#xD;
restless under the weight of its knowledge. The&#xD;
medium course which she took at the present&#xD;
time was the temporizing course which moral&#xD;
cowards always take. She was not true to&#xD;
either side ; she did as much harm both ways&#xD;
as she was capable of doing, and then shrank&#xD;
back, hoping to go scot-free of the blame which&#xD;
she dreaded more even than the responsibility&#xD;
of crline.&#xD;
"There is one thing I can do," said Alan,&#xD;
vaismng his head at last, and speaking a little&#xD;
hoarsely. "I can go to your husband. He, I&#xD;
presume, knows something of the matter as&#xD;
well as yourself, and the world mistakes him&#xD;
greatly if he is not an honest man. At least" .&#xD;
-not a little bitterness rang in the tone here&#xD;
-"he will not be afraid of Raymond."&#xD;
" Are you mad ?" cried Margaret, spring-.&#xD;
'ing forward with a pale, excited face, and&#xD;
catching his arm. " Do you want to rui me&#xD;
&#xD;
forever? If you do, go and put such suspicions&#xD;
as those into my husband's head ! He will never&#xD;
forgive you, never, and he will never forgive&#xD;
me, either!i He is honest-as honest as the&#xD;
day-and hoe knows nothing which might not&#xD;
be published to the whole world. If-if he&#xD;
even suspected that I knew any thing which&#xD;
was wrong, I don't believe he would ever speak&#xD;
to me again. 0 Alan, for Heaven's sake, don't&#xD;
-don't go to him!" .&#xD;
"Then tell me the truth," said Alan, seeing&#xD;
his advantage in her imploring face, and so in-&#xD;
tent upon his point that he did not stop to&#xD;
consider the means by which he hoped to&#xD;
gain it. -&#xD;
For answer, Margaret burst into passionate&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
" You are cruel! you are cowardly !" she&#xD;
cried. " I have done for you what no one else&#xD;
has done-I have shown you how to gain the&#xD;
truth-and, for thanks, you try by threats to&#xD;
force me into betraying secrets which are not&#xD;
mine, secrets which would be my ruin if I did&#xD;
betray them, Is this honorable ? - is this&#xD;
mauly ? I am a weak woman, and you come&#xD;
and- overawe me-why don't you go to Ray-.&#xD;
mond and make him tell you what you want to&#xD;
know ?"&#xD;
"I appealed to your honor and conscience,"&#xD;
said Alan. " You know, as well as I do, tfiat&#xD;
I might as well appeal to the honor and con-&#xD;
science of the devil as to those of my brother,.&#xD;
It seems, however," he wen on, gloomily, "that&#xD;
it was quite as useless to appeal to yours. I&#xD;
beg your pardon, however, for having forgotten&#xD;
myself so far as to utter what seemed like a&#xD;
threat. Since you assure me that your hus-&#xD;
band knows nothing of' the matter, I shall not&#xD;
speak to him. But I think it would be well&#xD;
for you to ask yourself whether the path you&#xD;
are following is likely to lead to happiness.&#xD;
You have confessed that you hold secrets which&#xD;
would be ruin if you betrayed them. Stop and&#xD;
consider whether they are most likely to be&#xD;
your ruin when told voluntarily by yourself; or&#xD;
when exposed by another ; as they will be if&#xD;
God gives me life to do it ?"&#xD;
" We do not know what may come before&#xD;
the exposure," said Margaret, evasively. "' Lu,&#xD;
I, any of us, may be dead. Besides, if the&#xD;
matter is merely exposed, my husband will&#xD;
have no proof that I knew of it. You may&#xD;
believe me, Alan-I speak as I might if I were&#xD;
on my death-bed-Ihad no share in i"&#xD;
She laid her hand on his in the 'energy of&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
CHECKED AND CHECKMATED.&#xD;
&#xD;
'/7&#xD;
&#xD;
her last words, but he shook it off as though&#xD;
the fair, white flesh had borne the taint of lep-.&#xD;
rosy.&#xD;
" What do you call the share of aiding in a.-&#xD;
criminal concealment ?" he asked, hoarsely,.&#xD;
" Don't blind yourself; don't think that your&#xD;
hands are clean because they were passive.&#xD;
Remember that you have had the opportunity&#xD;
to clear your conscience, and to right those&#xD;
who are wronged, and you have refused it.&#xD;
Hereafter I shall not trouble you. But when&#xD;
the day of reckoning comes, I shall not spare&#xD;
you, the passive instrument, any more than I&#xD;
shall spare the active authors of the wrong. I&#xD;
will take care of my life, too-iindful always&#xD;
with whom I have to deal-and trusting that I&#xD;
may not gyatify you in the death on which you&#xD;
build your hopes."&#xD;
" Hopes ! 0 Alan, hiow you wrong me, how&#xD;
bitterly you wrong me! Was I sorry to see&#xD;
you a little while ago ?"&#xD;
"No," said he, softening somewhat. " I&#xD;
believe you were not. But you have taken&#xD;
your first step on a dark road, Margaret, and&#xD;
who shall say where it will end ? "&#xD;
" It should end here and now, if I only&#xD;
dared," said Margaret-" if I only dasred !" she&#xD;
repeated, wringing her hands.&#xD;
"Dare for God's sake, for the sake of your&#xD;
-own conscience and your own soul 1 " said he,&#xD;
with passionate earnestness. " While I was&#xD;
considered dead, you had an excuse for silence;-&#xD;
now I am alive you have none ! Trample your&#xD;
fear of Raymond under foot ! I will protect you&#xD;
against him !"          -&#xD;
But she shrank back, her whole nature re--&#xD;
coiling from the path which he marked out.&#xD;
r otter, hesitate, temporize, if need be, but&#xD;
.never face a direct issue, og tell a direct truth.&#xD;
-That' was her creed-the creed which every&#xD;
natural instinct seconded so strongly that per-&#xD;
haps sfie did not merit all the indignant wrath&#xD;
and contempt that Alan felt. Do we not pity&#xD;
the man whose cheek grows white in the face&#xD;
of a danger from which he dies, not one but a&#xD;
thousand deaths ? - And should we not doubly&#xD;
pity the soul which shrinks from any and every&#xD;
ill; save, indeed, that ill which is eternal ?&#xD;
" I see that it is useless to urge you; I see&#xD;
that you will not take courage and do the&#xD;
thing which is right," said Alan, after a pause.&#xD;
unti th truth has seena th lgto RmR ember&#xD;
-if; indeed, we should not ever meet again,&#xD;
that you might have spared me much suffering,&#xD;
&#xD;
which, instead, I shall go forth on my errand&#xD;
bearing with me. Now, good-by. Will you--&#xD;
can you-wish me God-speed ?"&#xD;
"Yes-yes-with all my heart," said she,&#xD;
speaking through tears. "Believe me, Alan, I&#xD;
would tell you, if I could ; and, believe me, you.&#xD;
will be very near the truth when you reach&#xD;
Martinique. But don't make this goodby-&#xD;
pray, don't 1" she went on, eagerly. " Come&#xD;
back and ~dine with us-Mr. Saxton likes you.&#xD;
so much, and will be so glad to see you."&#xD;
"You are very kind," he said ; " but I&#xD;
should be ill company for any one just now-&#xD;
save the one whom I shallgo to see," he added,&#xD;
lowering his voice.&#xD;
-"And who is that one ?" asked Margaret,&#xD;
a little curiously.&#xD;
" My mother," he answered, simply.&#xD;
" Your mother ! "-the blue- eyes sprang&#xD;
wide open, for, two years before, while Alan&#xD;
was far away, the reaper Death had come and&#xD;
garnered into his sheaf the fair, sweet lady for-&#xD;
whom the young man chiefly toiled, leaving to&#xD;
him, when hie returned, only a short mound of&#xD;
earth, and a memory which could never die-&#xD;
" Alan-what do you mean? "&#xD;
" Not that I have turned spiritualist," said&#xD;
Alan, smiling a little sadly, " or that I would&#xD;
call her back for an hour, if I could. But I&#xD;
always go to her grave when I come home.&#xD;
Somehow I think she may know it and like it."&#xD;
" You are as faithful as a dog," said Mar..&#xD;
garet, touched unawares ; and is it not a fine&#xD;
irony on this human nature of ours that we can&#xD;
find no higher praise or better comparison for&#xD;
its fidelity than this ?&#xD;
So they parted, not in anger, nor yet with&#xD;
that cold challenge of opposing interest and&#xD;
aim which had been Alan's farewell to Mrs.&#xD;
Erle. Their hands clasped, they bade each&#xD;
other good-by (which, being interpreted, means,&#xD;
" God be with you "), and if Alan had notheard&#xD;
from his cousin's lips the truth for which he&#xD;
thirsted, he had at least heard that recom-&#xD;
mendation which accorded so well with his own&#xD;
desire-&#xD;
" Go to Martinique!"&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
.ANK D  ~CHtcKMATED.&#xD;
THE dusk of Christmas -Eve was dying&#xD;
away over the city roofs and spires, and the&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC8067-00000040"/>&#xD;
48                       EBB-TIDE.                                                    CHECKED AND CHECKMATED.&#xD;
&#xD;
"night before Christmas "-eagerly watched,&#xD;
eagerly desired by how many childish eyes&#xD;
and hearts !-had already fallen, when a sharp&#xD;
peal of the door-bell echoed through the ErIe&#xD;
house. For a marvel, Regy and Louise chanced&#xD;
to be, not in the nursery with their bonne, but&#xD;
in the sitting-room with their mother-the sit-&#xD;
ting-room brightened just now by the glow&#xD;
diffused from a vivid mass of coal which&#xD;
heaped the glittering grate, and looking rarely&#xD;
attractive with its bright pictures resting ease-&#xD;
fully in carved frames on the softly-tinted&#xD;
walls, its slender vases full of those fragrant&#xD;
flowers which the sweet South rarely refuses&#xD;
to her children, and one fair, cold statue stand-&#xD;
ing in motionless grace just within the bay-&#xD;
window, thrown into relief by therich sweep&#xD;
of the maroon curtains, and "bathed in the&#xD;
bloom of the firelight" which reached even&#xD;
'this distant nook.&#xD;
"Now you must go, children," said Mrs.&#xD;
Erle, as soon as she caught the sound. "You&#xD;
know I only allowed you to stay on condition&#xD;
you gave me no trouble in case any one came&#xD;
in. You shall come down again after a while,&#xD;
~but you must go now."&#xD;
"Mamma, you n'iqltt let us stay!" said&#xD;
Bogy, in a tone of expostulating persuasion.&#xD;
This young gentleman was lolling luxuriously&#xD;
in the depths of a capacious chair, and looked&#xD;
like a Louis-Quinze page in his blue-velvet&#xD;
suit, his delicate lace ruffles, and long, fair&#xD;
curls. "It's sure to be nobody but Cousin&#xD;
Raymond, or Mr. Saxton-and it's Christmas-&#xD;
Eve. There isn't any good in dressing up to&#xD;
go and stay with Marie. Do, please, pretty&#xD;
mamma, let us stay!"&#xD;
"Yes, mamma, please let us stay !" pleaded&#xD;
Louise, fired by the contagion of example, and&#xD;
mindful of her rose-colored silk and the broad&#xD;
sash which Marie's Parisian fingers had tied&#xD;
so deftly. "We won't say a word-will we,&#xD;
Regy?"&#xD;
"Not unless somebody says something to&#xD;
us," answered Regy, not quite ready to make&#xD;
such an unconditional covenant of silence.&#xD;
"Reginald, take your sister and leave the&#xD;
room at once" said Mrs. Erle, concisely.&#xD;
"Go up-stairs and stay with Marie until I&#xD;
send for you."&#xD;
Maste~' Reginald, somewhat crestfallen, tum-&#xD;
bled out of his cosy retreat and took Louise's&#xD;
tiny, outstretnlied hand. They were both&#xD;
beautiful children, and they looked like a lit-&#xD;
tIe fairy prince and princess, as they made&#xD;
&#xD;
their graceful courtesy (the courtesy taught&#xD;
to French children as soon as they walk), and&#xD;
left the room. Poor little elves! Their rear-&#xD;
ing was a queer mixture of two essentially dif-&#xD;
ferent systems - the nursery, which is un-&#xD;
known in French life, being their habitual&#xD;
home; while they were sedulously trained in&#xD;
that charming courtesy and docile obedience&#xD;
so remarkable in French childrenand, forth&#xD;
lack of which, English (and, how much more&#xD;
American!) children are, in nine cases out of&#xD;
ten, veritable little boors and plague-spots in&#xD;
society.&#xD;
As the small pair ascended the staircase,&#xD;
with disconsolate faces, Robin opened the&#xD;
front-door and admitted into the haIl a gentle-&#xD;
man who, only stopping a moment to throw&#xD;
off his overcoat,1 passed directly into the sit-&#xD;
ting-room.&#xD;
"It's nobody but Cousin Raymond!" said&#xD;
Louise, in an injured tone, pushing back her&#xD;
yellow curls and peering down through the&#xD;
balustrade which she was not tall enough to&#xD;
overlook.&#xD;
"Mamma might as well have let us stay,"&#xD;
said Bogy, also injured, and commanding a&#xD;
better view of matters and persons on account&#xD;
of his more exalted stature. "It's a shame&#xD;
to send us up-stairs Christmas-Eve," pursued&#xD;
the young gentleman. "I say, Louise, don't&#xD;
let's go to Marie. She's in her room, finishing&#xD;
a present for her sweetheart-he knows all&#xD;
about it, though, for I saw her working his&#xD;
name on it, and I told him so-and we can&#xD;
go and have a peep at the Christmas-tree&#xD;
without anybody knowing it!"&#xD;
"Oh, but Bogy, there isn't any Christmas-&#xD;
tree yet," said Louise, breathless and open-&#xD;
eyed. "You know Santa Claus never comes&#xD;
till midnight."&#xD;
"Then what is the nursery locked up for?"&#xD;
demanded Bogy, with superb skepticism.&#xD;
may believe' in Santa Claus, Louise, because&#xD;
you are a very little girl; but I know better.*&#xD;
I saw Robin carry the tree into the nursery,&#xD;
and I saw Marie hanging the lights on it. She&#xD;
shut the door in my face, but I knew what&#xD;
she was doing. Now, if we go and peep&#xD;
through the key-hole, we can find out what we&#xD;
arc going to have."&#xD;
"Can we?" said Louise, yielding to temp-&#xD;
tation with Eve-like readiness-violet eyes&#xD;
wide open, and coral lips apart-"then,&#xD;
Bogy, let us go!"&#xD;
"All right," said Bogy, "come this way ! ~&#xD;
&#xD;
And, hand-in-hand, the two young conspira-&#xD;
tors marched down the thickly-carpeted corri-&#xD;
dor to the nursery-door. There they remained,&#xD;
engaged in alternately applying one eye to the&#xD;
key-hole and being rewarded by a view of the&#xD;
extreme corner of the table on which the&#xD;
Christmas-tree was supposed to rest.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Mrs. ~rle was saying to Ray-&#xD;
mond, with an unust~al degree of solicitude in&#xD;
her voice:&#xD;
"Do sit down and get warm-I am sure&#xD;
the weather must be horribly damp. You&#xD;
look pale. Are you sick? Will you have a&#xD;
glass of wine?"&#xD;
"No, thanks," said he, sinking into the&#xD;
chair which Bogy had vacated, and basking in&#xD;
the genial warmth of the fire very much as&#xD;
that youn~ gentleman had done before him.&#xD;
"Do I look pale?" he went on, tossing back&#xD;
one or two dark locks that had fallen across&#xD;
his gleaming forehead. "I am not at all sick&#xD;
-only, perhaps, a little tired."&#xD;
"I am afraid you have had a very trying&#xD;
day," said she, looking at him closely, almost&#xD;
anxiously.&#xD;
"Rather more trying than I anticipated&#xD;
this morning, certainly," he answered, care-&#xD;
lessly. "But I can take my ease to-night"&#xD;
-he leaned back in the soft velvet depths,&#xD;
and looked as if he was taking it-" with the&#xD;
consciousness of rest well earned-of difficul-&#xD;
ties and dangers successfully met and left be-&#xD;
hind,"&#xD;
Mrs. Erie started and glanced at him keen..&#xD;
ly-a shade of color which was not cast by&#xD;
the fire, flickering into her alabaster cheek.&#xD;
"You don't usually underrate difficulties&#xD;
or dangers," she said; "else I should think&#xD;
that you were surely unaware what an enemy&#xD;
this day has raised up for you2'&#xD;
"Do you think that an enemy who comes&#xD;
and throws his intentions like a challenge in&#xD;
your teeth, is mu6h to be feared?" he asked,&#xD;
with a curl of his well-cut lips.&#xD;
"Not to be feared, perhaps, but certainly&#xD;
not to be despised. That would be a great&#xD;
~rror-the greatest of the two."&#xD;
"My friend, I never despise anybody,"&#xD;
said Raymond, more earnestly than before.&#xD;
"I know the world too well for such folly.&#xD;
Nobody is too insignificant either to serve or&#xD;
to injure one's interest. It should be a cardi-&#xD;
nal principle with every wise man never to&#xD;
make an enemy wantonly-never to offend the&#xD;
most humble, unless absolutely forced to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
There are few better fables than that of the&#xD;
lion and the mouse."&#xD;
"Yet you make enemies without heed-&#xD;
apparentlyl without care-when compelled to&#xD;
do so."&#xD;
"You say right-when compelled to do so.&#xD;
If I have a great end in view, I don't let a few&#xD;
individuals bar my way to it~ but 'neither do&#xD;
I ever neglect any reasonable precautions&#xD;
against their malice. Of course, these precau-&#xD;
tions are rendered much more easy when my&#xD;
adversary is kind enough to show me his&#xD;
hand, and make me a confidant in his plans&#xD;
for my defeat."&#xD;
"Do you think that Alan has done this?"&#xD;
"I received your note, written just after he&#xD;
left. If he had conceived any plan more brill-&#xD;
iant than the one with which he favored you, he&#xD;
would certainly have returned to let you hear&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"Don't be too sure of that, and don't,&#xD;
don't let your contempt for him lead you into&#xD;
carelessness. If ever a man was in earnest,&#xD;
that man was in earnest today! If ever a&#xD;
man was dangerous, that man was dangerous&#xD;
today! Don't deceive yourself-don't think&#xD;
that his bitterness will evaporate in idle threats.&#xD;
There was the look of a bloodhound in his&#xD;
eyes when he said he would track the matter&#xD;
down!"&#xD;
"Very likely!" said Raymond; but, with&#xD;
all his superb carelessness, there was some.&#xD;
thing of a dangerous gleam under his own&#xD;
sweeping lashes. "The bloodhound is an un-&#xD;
reasoning brute, who is simply useless when&#xD;
you throw him off the scent."&#xD;
"You will find it hard to throw this man&#xD;
off the scent."&#xD;
He laughed-a low, slightly mocking laugh&#xD;
-which would have roused Alan to frenzy if&#xD;
he could have heard it.&#xD;
"On the contrary, very easy-so easy that&#xD;
the fact may be regarded as accomplished."&#xD;
"How can that be possible?"&#xD;
"How could it be other than possible when&#xD;
you consider how lacking in acuteness, how&#xD;
full only of brute strength and brute tenacity&#xD;
such a man is?"&#xD;
"But-do you know that he is going to&#xD;
Martinique?"&#xD;
"Have I not said that I received your&#xD;
note? Of course, therefore, I know it."&#xD;
"And he will find-"&#xD;
"The island, and the mountains, and no&#xD;
doubt some old friends-these sailors know&#xD;

80&#xD;
&#xD;
EBB-TIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
people everywhere-but not the person of&#xD;
whom he is in search."&#xD;
"You talk enigma;" said Mrs. Erle, with&#xD;
an impatient gesture. "You forget, that the&#xD;
risk is as much mine as yours. I must hear&#xD;
plainly what you have done."&#xD;
"You will hear in a moment," he answered.&#xD;
"Is not that my uncle's step?"&#xD;
He turned his head as he spoke, and Mr.&#xD;
Erie-handsome, smiling, debonair as ever-&#xD;
entered the room. If Raymond looked thinner&#xD;
and paler than he had done the preceding&#xD;
May, Mr. Erie, on the contrary, looked even&#xD;
better in health and spirits than on that by-&#xD;
gone evening when we saw him first. Con.&#xD;
treating the two faces, almost any stranger&#xD;
would have regarded the nephew as the elder&#xD;
man of the two, and would certainly have&#xD;
been astonished to learn how the difference&#xD;
of age in reality existed. In truth, the slight,&#xD;
graceful, blond ~gentleman who came forward,&#xD;
did not look as if the vexatious and cares of&#xD;
life had ever cost him many unquiet moments,&#xD;
or as if his mind was ever ruffled by any thing&#xD;
deeper than the tie of his cravat, or the ar-&#xD;
rangement of his golden curls. Regarding him&#xD;
abstractly, it might have proved hard for the&#xD;
apocryphal stranger aforesaid to realize that&#xD;
this was indeed the man of whom his very&#xD;
rivals admitted that no keener, shrewder,&#xD;
subtler intellect had ever come within the&#xD;
range of their experience-the man in whose&#xD;
hands Raymond, clever as he was, had been&#xD;
throughout life little more than a puppet, and&#xD;
with whom had originated every well-planned&#xD;
scheme which had gone to make or to secure&#xD;
their common fortune.&#xD;
As he passed on his way to the fire, he&#xD;
,,lightly brushed his wife's forehead with his&#xD;
amber mustache, a ad gave Raymond a note of&#xD;
recognition. Then he took his stand on the&#xD;
rug, and surveyed the company.&#xD;
"Have you been talking sentiment, that&#xD;
the gas is not lighted yet?" he asked, smiling.&#xD;
"This firelight is very pretty, and makes my&#xD;
Clytie yonder look as if she were veritable&#xD;
alive; but I have a weakness for bright light&#xD;
as well as for warm fires. Do you object,&#xD;
rn'amie?" This to his wife, as he took a&#xD;
prettily twisted and fringed allumette from a&#xD;
stand on the mantel.&#xD;
"Not at all," Mrs. Erie answered. "Indeed,&#xD;
I should have had the gas lighted before this,&#xD;
only dusk deepened into night so rapidly that&#xD;
I forgot to ring for Robin; and neither Ray-&#xD;
&#xD;
mond nor I have been doing any thing to feel&#xD;
the need of light."&#xD;
"You have been talking," said Mr. Erie.&#xD;
"Do you call that Dot doing any thing? For&#xD;
one fact that you learn from words, you can&#xD;
learn twenty at least from the eyes and the&#xD;
expression of the face."&#xD;
"But that is a sword which cuts both&#xD;
ways," said Raymond.&#xD;
"Ah," said his uncle, with smiling benigni-&#xD;
ty, "you mean that your own face might turn&#xD;
traitor and tell tales? Bah I my dear boy,~iot&#xD;
if you discipline it properly. Did Richclieu's&#xD;
waxen mask ever betray him? And why&#xD;
should we not all be Richdicus in private life?&#xD;
There I-is not that beautiful?"&#xD;
He lighted the a~lumet1e as he spoke, and&#xD;
held it to the cup of a bronze lily, from which&#xD;
instantly sprang a sheet of vivid white flame-&#xD;
filling the whole room with dazzling radiance,&#xD;
and banishing mercilessly the soft, rosy tint&#xD;
of the lire. Mrs. ErIe and Raymond shaded&#xD;
their eyes from the sudden glare, but Mr. Erie&#xD;
regarded it steadily. "There cannot be such&#xD;
a thing as too much light I" he said, emphati-&#xD;
cally; yet in consideration of the optical weak.&#xD;
ness of his companions, he tempered the jet&#xD;
with a porcelain shade,.that mellowed the white&#xD;
glow to a lustrous moonlight. Then he came&#xD;
back and resumed his place on the hearth-rug.&#xD;
After a moment's silence, Raymond looked up&#xD;
and spoke.&#xD;
"I am sure you would not have left the&#xD;
office unless some answer had come," he said.&#xD;
"What was it?"&#xD;
*" Now that the gas is lighted, you can&#xD;
read for yourself" said Mr. Erie, taking a&#xD;
folded paper from his pocket and handing it to&#xD;
him.&#xD;
The young man received it with something&#xD;
of a flush on his clear, dark cheek. When&#xD;
fortune or. ruin is staked on a single chance, a.&#xD;
single turn of the wheel or throw of the dice,&#xD;
does not the most immovable gambler betray&#xD;
the sharp tension of hope and despair by so e&#xD;
such token as this-some token so slight thpt&#xD;
only the keenest ~ye could detect it? Raymond's&#xD;
dark lashes swept his cheek as he glanced pver&#xD;
the few lines written on a slip of paper eon-&#xD;
taining the printed form of the telegraph&#xD;
company-but when they lifted, there was a&#xD;
bright, satisfied glow in the eyes thus un-&#xD;
veiled.&#xD;
"You asked what I had done," he said to&#xD;
Mrs. Erie. "Read that."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
CHECKED AND CHECKMATED,&#xD;
&#xD;
She took the paper eagerly from his out&#xD;
stretched hand. It was a short telegram&#xD;
dated in New York, at four o'clock that after&#xD;
noon, and signed by a business agent of the&#xD;
Erie house, containing these words:&#xD;
"Your message has becn received and en&#xD;
closed in a letter to Mrs. Erie's address. The&#xD;
steamer leaves punctually at twelve, 'to-mor.&#xD;
row."&#xD;
She read these lines twice over, before&#xD;
looking i~p. Then:&#xD;
"I see-.partly but not entirely," she said,&#xD;
"Tell me exactly what it means."&#xD;
"What it means," repeated Raymond,&#xD;
rising like a man who flings off some great&#xD;
weight, and standing by his uncle's side. "It&#xD;
means that your 'bloodhound' is thrown off&#xD;
the sccnl-that he is checked and check-&#xD;
mated at ~is very first move."&#xD;
"Belt'airne, you do injustice to your own&#xD;
quickness of perception," said Mr. Erie, break-&#xD;
ing in here with a smile. "Placed in Ray-&#xD;
mond's position, your own instincts would&#xD;
have suggested, I am sure, exactly what Ray-&#xD;
mond has done. When Alan was kind enough&#xD;
to tell you that he was going to Martinique&#xD;
(or at least something equivalent to that),&#xD;
what was your first thought?"&#xD;
"One of despair," answered Mrs. Erie.&#xD;
"I knew that he could go there as soon as&#xD;
Raymond could, and equally of course as soon&#xD;
as a letter. I confess I saw no mode of&#xD;
escape."&#xD;
"And I confess that I shared the same&#xD;
feeling for a short time after he left me,"&#xD;
said Raymond. "I did little more than curse&#xD;
the fate which failed to bring his letter, and&#xD;
thus left me unprepared for his appearance.&#xD;
But my uncle came in, and his first word was&#xD;
a ray of light in the darkness."&#xD;
"I merely made a suggestion," said Mr.&#xD;
Erie, modestly. "Your mind at once caught&#xD;
at it, and supplied every thing necessary for&#xD;
following it out. You had been shocked, and&#xD;
had not quite recovered from the effect of it-&#xD;
that was all. In a little while the same idea&#xD;
would have occurred to yourself."&#xD;
"I am not so sure of that," said Raymond,&#xD;
a little bluntly. "Your suggestions, sir, are&#xD;
always somehow the germ of all that comes&#xD;
after. Well, at all events" (speaking to Mrs.&#xD;
Erie), "my unule asked me when the mail.&#xD;
steamer for the West Indies left New York-&#xD;
and, like a flash, I saw what to do! I remem-&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
81&#xD;
&#xD;
- bered that the steamer left either to-day or to-&#xD;
morrow, giving, as you perceive, no time for a&#xD;
- letter or for my own departure, but being as&#xD;
conveniently ready for a telegram as if it had&#xD;
been my private property. I telegraphed,&#xD;
therefore, to Forbes to the following effect"&#xD;
(he took a note-book, from his pocket and&#xD;
read): "'Write by the Martinique steamer&#xD;
to Mrs. Raymond Erie, care Delaroche &amp;amp; Co.,&#xD;
St. Pierre, Martinique, giving this message:&#xD;
"Do not wait for me, but leave the island at&#xD;
once for France, via any port on the continent&#xD;
of Europe, Do not delay a day, but write me&#xD;
from Paris. I will meet you there." Enclose&#xD;
the present telegram as an authority, and an-&#xD;
swer at once, saying when steamer will leave.'&#xD;
Now" (closing the book and returning it to&#xD;
the breast-pocket of his coat), "you have&#xD;
heard that the stearher leaves New York to.&#xD;
morrow at twelve o'clock. Could any thing,&#xD;
short of a balloon, get a man who is in Charles.&#xD;
ton now, there in time to leave in it?"&#xD;
"When does the next steamer leave?"&#xD;
"The next direct steamer does not leave&#xD;
for a month. He must therefore take some&#xD;
indirect steam-line, or else go in a sailing-&#xD;
vessel. In either case the bird will have flown&#xD;
before he reaches the island."'&#xD;
"Are you sure that she will go?"&#xD;
"Perfectly sure of that"(very dryly).&#xD;
"I cannot help doubting it. She is both&#xD;
perverse and obstinate."&#xD;
"Not with me," said Raymond, dryly,&#xD;
again. "She knows that whenl amin earnest,&#xD;
I am not to be trifled with, and I am perfectly&#xD;
satisfied that she will obey that telegram as&#xD;
soon as she receives it."&#xD;
"But he / Will nothis suspicions be more&#xD;
than verified when he reaches Martinique and&#xD;
finds her gone?"&#xD;
"Whyshould they be when he wiihave no&#xD;
proof of my having had any communication&#xD;
with her? Not that it matters, however, if they&#xD;
are. She will be gone."&#xD;
"He can follow her to France; and I think&#xD;
he will!"&#xD;
Raymond shrugged his shoulders.&#xD;
"Let him! Once in Paris, I defy him!"&#xD;
"And then," said Mr. ErIe's quiet, pleasant&#xD;
voice, "you forget, my love, that in Paris he&#xD;
will find ~adelon Lautrec; and Madelon has&#xD;
wonderful dramatic capabilities undeveloped.&#xD;
I always told you that. Trust me, a little self-&#xD;
interest will develop them amazingly."&#xD;
Mrs. ErIe glanced from one to the other-.&#xD;

&#xD;
from the clear, handsome, dark face, to the fair,&#xD;
handsome, blond one-as if trying to take in&#xD;
the full significance of her husband's words.&#xD;
Then the white lids fell over her eyes, and&#xD;
the white hands lying in her lap clasped them.&#xD;
selves together.&#xD;
"I see!" she said. "But it is a dangerous&#xD;
game.&#xD;
"What game worth the playing is not dan-&#xD;
gerous?" asked her husband, with something&#xD;
like an inflection of disdain in his well-modu-&#xD;
lated voice. "By-the-by, I forgot to say that&#xD;
Major Dunwardin will look in after tea for a&#xD;
game of whist. Do you think you would&#xD;
care to play if you were entirely certain of&#xD;
the result?"&#xD;
"I am no coward," said Mrs. Erie. "But&#xD;
some risks seem to me too great to be run.&#xD;
I may be wrong, or I may be right, but&#xD;
1 distrustt Madelon; an&amp;amp;I should never, un-&#xD;
der any circumstances, allow her to meet&#xD;
Alan."&#xD;
"You forget," said Mr. Erie, with un-&#xD;
moved quietness, "where Madelon's interest&#xD;
lies. She is in the same boat with ourselves,&#xD;
and no degree of sentiment is likely to induce&#xD;
her to throw herself out, only to be drowned."&#xD;
"Still it would be safest-"&#xD;
"Always to play a bold game," interrupted&#xD;
he, putting out his hand and smoothing her&#xD;
hair with a caressing motion. "Cowardness&#xD;
has wrecked more fortunes than rashness ever&#xD;
did, rn'atnie. If the ebances were a thousand&#xD;
to one against success, I should still ~take all&#xD;
on the one chance. But as it is "&#xD;
"The chances are a thousand to one for&#xD;
success," concluded Raymond, as he paused.&#xD;
"Exactly," said Mr. Erie, smiling. "And&#xD;
after a time we may hope that our marine Don&#xD;
Quixote will fall in love with somebody else ann&#xD;
go back to his legitimate business. Until then,&#xD;
our friend here" (smiling at Raymond), "will&#xD;
have to prosecute his training in a diplomatic&#xD;
point of view, for I agree with you" (this to&#xD;
Mrs. Earle), "in thinking that even brute cour-&#xD;
ag~1 when once roused, may be dangerous.&#xD;
But muscle is no match for mind, in the long.&#xD;
run, and what Raymond has I am sure Ray.&#xD;
mond will keep."&#xD;
"To the last gasp 1" said Raymond, be-&#xD;
tween his set teeth.&#xD;
His uncle patted him on the shoulder ap.&#xD;
provingly, then turned away, and, humming in&#xD;
a soft tone of voice the "Ak! eke la mot-te,"&#xD;
walked across the room toward the lovely&#xD;
&#xD;
statue in the bay-window; before which he&#xD;
paused.&#xD;
"Women of flesh and blood," said he, med-&#xD;
itatively, "are sometimes sources of great an-&#xD;
noyance, but, to compensate for it, wemen in&#xD;
marble are certainly sources of rare enjoyment.&#xD;
Could any thing be more exquisite than this&#xD;
Clytie? Ah, Raymond my dear boy, when&#xD;
will you learn to love art as art should be&#xD;
loved! For myself," he ~vent on, casting a&#xD;
regretful sigh over his shoulder, "I confess that&#xD;
I should have been the happiest man in the&#xD;
world if Fate had only been kind enough to&#xD;
have made me a sculptor!"&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
AN EMPTY NEST.&#xD;
.4.s all the world knows (or might know, if&#xD;
it felt any interest in the matter), communica-&#xD;
tion with the different islands of the West In-&#xD;
dies is not quite so open and direct as with&#xD;
Liverpool, Havre, or Bremen; in coasequenec&#xD;
of which fact it followed that, despite a great&#xD;
deal of fiery impatience, Alan Erle verified his&#xD;
brother's kind prediction, and was some time in&#xD;
reaching his destination. In truth, the month&#xD;
of January was wellaigh spent when a steamer&#xD;
from St. Thomas touched at St. Pierre, the&#xD;
commercial metropolis of Martinique, and&#xD;
landed several passengers. Of these passen-&#xD;
gers, Alan was one. Declining the kind in-&#xD;
vitation of a fellow-traveller (a creole planter&#xD;
who had taken a great fancy to him, and who&#xD;
pointed out his pleasant country-seat as they&#xD;
ran along the shore of the island), the young&#xD;
man made his way to an hotel, and thence,&#xD;
without loss of time, to the commission-house&#xD;
of Delaroche &amp;amp; Co., whom he remembered as&#xD;
the business agents of Colonel Vivicux.&#xD;
Arriving at the latter place, the mention of&#xD;
his name proved a passport which admitted&#xD;
him at once to the senior partner-a white-&#xD;
haired old Frenchman, courteous as all&#xD;
Frenchmen are, and sallow as all inhabitants&#xD;
of the tropics soon become-who manifested&#xD;
a considerable degree of surprise at sight of&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Erie !-Monsicur Erie!" said he, looking&#xD;
in almost amusing bewilderment at the tall,&#xD;
stately figure, and bronzed, handsome face be-&#xD;
fore him. "I beg your pardon, Monsieur; I&#xD;
fancy there is some mistake" (bowing as only&#xD;
&#xD;
a Frenchman can bow), "I was told that Afon- j eyes which age had net robbed of their bright-&#xD;
aieur Erie desired to see me." J ness or their keenness. Then, dropping the&#xD;
"Erie is my name," answered Alan, in glass with a little click, he answered with Un.&#xD;
French as good as he could muster. "But it diminished courtesy:&#xD;
was my brother, Raymond ErIe, perhaps whom "Madame Erie is on the ocean at present,&#xD;
you expected to see." monsieur. She left the island last week."&#xD;
"Yes, it was Monsieur Raymond Erie whom   "Left the island!"&#xD;
I expected to see," said M. Delaroche. "But" If a chasm had ya~vned beneath Alan's&#xD;
(with another bow), "you have the happiness feet, he could scarcely have been more aston.&#xD;
to be his brother" (" A very precious happi. ished. Left the island! Ermine left the isi.&#xD;

It was now Alan's turn to bow, and to roche, he was wondering if despair had driven&#xD;

have often heard Mademoiselle St. Amand- She was anxious, also, to procure a companion&#xD;
that is, Madame ErIe-speak of you, and, hay- for the voyage. Fortunately, a lady-an es-&#xD;
ing just landed in Martinique, I thought I timable widow of our acquaintance-was re-&#xD;
should save time if I came to you at once to turning to France, and Madame Erle-"&#xD;
inquire where I can soonest find her."       "To France!" said Alan, interrupting this&#xD;
"I am always happy to afford information history with merciless impetuosity. "To&#xD;
to any friend of Madame Erie's," was the suave France, monsieur! You must be mistaken!&#xD;
reply. "But, in the present instance, I fear Surely Ermine-surely Madame Erie went to&#xD;
that you will be disappointed. The lady of America, if she went anywhere?"&#xD;
whom you speak cannot be found anywhere "Your pardon, monsieur, she went to&#xD;
very soon. She is not in Martinique." France," said M. Delaroche, with unchanged&#xD;
"Not in Martinique!" repeated Alan, pal- courtesy. "I had the honor of attending to&#xD;
lag as suddenly as he had flushed the moment all her arrangements, and of bidding her adieu&#xD;
before. "Good Heavens! What do you mean? on the deck of the steamer Vile do Paris,&#xD;
Where is she, then?"                      which sailed for Marseilles last Wednesday."&#xD;
The old Frenchman put up his eye-glass and He spoke with a positive certainty, which&#xD;
regarded the young man for a moment with could not have failed in carrying conviction t~&#xD;

EBB-TIDE-.&#xD;
&#xD;
the most obstinately incredulous, since we&#xD;
cannot well disbelieve that which a man tells&#xD;
us he has seen with his own eyes, and heard&#xD;
with his own ears. To poor Alan-for whom&#xD;
the tide of fortune had, to all appearance,&#xD;
ebbed indeed-the realization of this second&#xD;
shocki was terrible. Almost involuntarily, he&#xD;
put out his hand to grasp some steadying sup-&#xD;
port. Gone ! But whsy had she gone ? That&#xD;
was the question which sprung instantly to&#xD;
his mind, and which his lips uttered-a little&#xD;
hoarsely:&#xD;
" This is strange news," he said ; " so&#xD;
strange, that I shall be glad if you can throw a&#xD;
little light upon the matter. What reason did&#xD;
my sister-in-law" (he uttered the last words&#xD;
'with a sort of savage emphasis) "give for such&#xD;
a sudden and extraordinary departure ?"&#xD;
" Monsieur," answered the old Frenchman,&#xD;
with an air so stately that it would not have&#xD;
misbecome a Dc Rohan, " Madame Erie gave&#xD;
no reason for her departure, and it certainly&#xD;
never occurred to me to ask her for one."'&#xD;
" Perhaps you think it singular that I&#xD;
should ask for one," said Alan, amused in a&#xD;
certain unamused way by the quietness of this&#xD;
rebuke. "But you must do me the justice to&#xD;
remember that the lady of whom we speak is&#xD;
my brother's wife " (why is it that we some-&#xD;
times find a fierce pleasure in stabbing our-&#xD;
selves with our own words, as Alan stabbed&#xD;
himself with these ?); "I have a right to feel&#xD;
some interest in her movements, therefore."&#xD;
"It is a right which I have not denied,"&#xD;
said M. Delaroche, with another bow."&#xD;
After this, there was silence for several i&#xD;
minutes. M. Delaroche coughed gently be-&#xD;
hind his hand, and tried not to look as if he&#xD;
expected his singular visitor to take his de-&#xD;
parture ; while the singular visitor tried vainly -&#xD;
to think how he could best introduce several&#xD;
questions which might fairly be said to burn&#xD;
his tongue. He would quite as soon have&#xD;
thought of cutting his throat as of giving to&#xD;
this stranger even a hint concerning his story,&#xD;
yet-how else excuse, how else account for&#xD;
his interest in the affairs of his "brother's 4&#xD;
wife ?"&#xD;
" Monsieur," said he at last, with a wistful&#xD;
accent in his voice, and wistful look in his&#xD;
eyes, "you say that Madame Erie spent sev-&#xD;
eral days in your house before her departure. I&#xD;
You must therefore have seen her very con-&#xD;
stantly."&#xD;
Again M. Delaroche bowed. Surely, by-&#xD;
&#xD;
the-by, a Frenchman's backbone must be&#xD;
composed of much more pliant material than&#xD;
that of other people (people of the race of&#xD;
pokers, otherwise Anglo-Saxons, especially),&#xD;
else how would the constant demand for bows.&#xD;
be so constantly honored as it is by that ur-&#xD;
bane and charming people ?&#xD;
" I had that honor, monsieur," said he.&#xD;
"Perhaps, then," said Alan -desperate&#xD;
now, and determined to fight his way to the.&#xD;
truth through any opposition or misunder-&#xD;
standing-" you will allow me to ask if she-&#xD;
impressed you as a happy or a contented&#xD;
woman ?"&#xD;
" Monsieur !"&#xD;
The old Frenchman moved a little back-&#xD;
ward in his amazement. For a moment he&#xD;
thought of lunacy, and cast about in his mind&#xD;
for a means of rescue from this ecentric com-&#xD;
panion-but something sad as well as Isane in&#xD;
the clear sea-colored eyes regarding himn, went&#xD;
far to reassure these fears-.&#xD;
" Monsieur," said he, " I confess that I do-&#xD;
not comprehend you."&#xD;
" I am aware that my French is by no,&#xD;
means very good," said Alan, smiling faintly.&#xD;
"Still I think you might comprehend mne-if&#xD;
you desired to do so. Understand this," he&#xD;
went on, earnestly and a little proudly, " I ask&#xD;
nothing which the strictest sense of [honor&#xD;
could prevent granting. I came here hoping&#xD;
to see Madame Erle. I am an old and deeply-&#xD;
attached friend, besides being" (a bitter ac-&#xD;
cent here) " a newly-made relative. You tell&#xD;
me that she is gone, and that I have had my&#xD;
voyage for nothing. ,At least, then, I can ask&#xD;
a 'question which my own eyes would have&#xD;
answered for me, if I had seen her-at least&#xD;
you can tell me if she seemed happy ?"&#xD;
Said Ra'ymond once, in speaking of his&#xD;
brother: ".The secret of Alan's success in life&#xD;
is his moral force. That gives him an ascen-&#xD;
dency over men independent of any other&#xD;
power. He says to them, 'Do this,' and they&#xD;
do it before they stop to consider that he had&#xD;
not the least right to issue such a command."&#xD;
On the ground, then, of this moral force-a&#xD;
subtle but certainly a manifest weapon of ag-.&#xD;
gression-we may account for the effect which&#xD;
this last speech had upon M. Delaroche. The&#xD;
eye-glass came into play again, but Alan's-&#xD;
honest face seconded his honest words so well.&#xD;
that the old man could not distrust their evi-&#xD;
dence-full as he was of shrewd, worldly cx-&#xD;
perience.' Now, although we are accustomed.&#xD;

&#xD;
to think that worldly-wise people are also, of&#xD;
necessity, suspicious people, it remains a ques-&#xD;
tion whether the man who suspects every&#xD;
thing is not farther removed from trustworthy&#xD;
knowledge of his kind, than he who believes&#xD;
every thing. One thing is certain: if worldly&#xD;
wisdom indeed be worth the price which some&#xD;
of us are willing to pay for it, it should be-&#xD;
stow upon us the power of discriminating be-&#xD;
tween what is true and what is false, what is&#xD;
genuine and what is sham, by some infallible&#xD;
test. Real worldly wisdom does this ; spuri-&#xD;
ous worldly wisdom (the kind which flourishes&#xD;
before our eyes to such an aggravating extent)&#xD;
never achieves it. With the disciples of the&#xD;
latter school, "to doubt," is the only verb&#xD;
which they are able to conjugate.&#xD;
This, liowever, is a digression. Said M.&#xD;
Delaroche, kindly, but with a certain stiffness .&#xD;
" If you had seen Madame Erle, monsieur,&#xD;
I think you would have been satisfied that she&#xD;
bears no outward signs of unhappiness. Of&#xD;
her inner life ".-with a French shrug-" God&#xD;
and herself alone can tell."&#xD;
" Does she seem in good health ?" -asked&#xD;
Alan-thirsting as men in a desert thirst for&#xD;
water, for one glimpse of the face on which&#xD;
his companion's eyes had rested so recently.&#xD;
" In very good health, I think," said M.&#xD;
.Delaroche, looking a little puzzled. "She is&#xD;
pale and slender, but I should say that both&#xD;
these facts were constitutional with her."&#xD;
"Yes, she was always pale and slender,"&#xD;
said- Alan, remembering, with a sharp pang,&#xD;
how often he had likened her graceful, stain-&#xD;
less beauty to adl1iy. '&#xD;
There was another pause. This time M.&#xD;
Delaroche did not try not to look as if he ex-&#xD;
pected this peculiar visit and more peculiar&#xD;
catechism to end-and Alan saw the expecta-&#xD;
tion very plainly. He rose to his feet, there-&#xD;
fore.&#xD;
" I have to thank you for a very courteous&#xD;
reception, monsieur," said he, "and to express&#xD;
my regret at having troubled you. Before I&#xD;
leave Martinique, however, I should like to see&#xD;
and to enter the St. Amand house, of which I&#xD;
have heard Ermine speak very often. Is it&#xD;
possible to do so ?"&#xD;
"Perfectly possible," answered M. Dela-&#xD;
-roehe. -"I shall be happy to furnish you&#xD;
with a letter of introduction to the persons&#xD;
left in charge of the establishment, and they&#xD;
will give you admittance at once."&#xD;
"It is in Fort de France, is it no  "&#xD;
&#xD;
"In the neighborhood of Fort de France-&#xD;
a most beautiful place, and I assure you, mon-&#xD;
sieur, the finest sugar-plantation on the island.&#xD;
Its yield during the past year has been enor-&#xD;
mous."&#xD;
"Indeedi!" said Alan, listlessly. "But it is&#xD;
only the house I desire to see."&#xD;
In fact, he felt wrathful toward the unof-&#xD;
fending plantation, and would have been glad-&#xD;
to invoke the green waves of the sea to cover&#xD;
its fertile acres. Would not Ermine still have&#xD;
been his but for those hogsheads of sugar, and&#xD;
the tempting sum which the accumulation of&#xD;
their proceeds had made during a long mi-&#xD;
nority ?"&#xD;
After this, he -and M. Delaroche parted&#xD;
very amicably. Having been questioned con-&#xD;
cerning the mode of reaching Fort de France,&#xD;
and having answered that the small passen-&#xD;
ger-steamer which plied between the two ports&#xD;
would not go down until the next morning, the&#xD;
latter yielded to a sudden attack of that mania&#xD;
of hospitality which afflicts everybody in these&#xD;
"Summer isles of Eden, lying in dark-purple spheres&#xD;
of sea"'&#xD;
and begged Alan to do himself and his wife&#xD;
the honor of dining with them that evening.&#xD;
This, however, Captain Erle declined, pleading&#xD;
the weariness of being just off a voyage-&#xD;
which would have been a sufficiently absurd&#xD;
excuse from any one, but was most particularly&#xD;
so from a sailor-and, with renewed compli-&#xD;
ments, and much moreplaisir and Aonneur, on&#xD;
both sides, he and M. Delaroche parted and&#xD;
went their ways like two ships of different na-&#xD;
tions, which, having met in foreign seas, ex-&#xD;
change a few words of friendly greeting, and&#xD;
then pass on-to cross each other's paths&#xD;
never again.&#xD;
Often as Alan had been within the tropic&#xD;
belt-often, indeed, as he had cruised in the&#xD;
enchanted waters of the Spanish Main, and&#xD;
lingered among the fairy islands which these&#xD;
waters encircle-he was almost tempted to&#xD;
think that he had never appreciated the full&#xD;
glory of tropical scenery until he stood on the.&#xD;
deck of the steamer which ran from St. Pierre&#xD;
to Fort do France, and looked at the panorama&#xD;
of sea and shore spread before him. Was it&#xD;
because this was Ermine's native island--the&#xD;
island of which she never spoke save in tones&#xD;
of tenderest affection-that it bore to his eyes&#xD;
such a radiant seeming ? This may have been&#xD;

so, since we J~now that love has power to gild&#xD;
all things connected with the beloved.. Yet,&#xD;
apart from such association, any one blessed&#xD;
with that keen sense of the beautiful which is&#xD;
classed under the general and indefinite head&#xD;
of "loving Nature," might well have been en-&#xD;
raptured, for, in all the lovely tropical world,&#xD;
there is no lovelier spot than the fair isle of&#xD;
Martinique!&#xD;
It is mountainous, as everybody knows&#xD;
(that is, everybody who has paid proper atten-&#xD;
tion to the study of geography), and when we&#xD;
put mountains, and sea, and tropical vegetation,&#xD;
and a tropical sky together, what more of&#xD;
beauty can we have, short of that Celestial&#xD;
Country o*vhich we dream, ~na of which St.&#xD;
Bernard wrote? Indeed, there are some of us&#xD;
who, would freely sign away three hundred&#xD;
and sixty-five of life's short, golden days to&#xD;
gaze at length upon the scene on which Alan&#xD;
gazed that morning. It was a glorious morn-&#xD;
ing-even for the tropics-and, through the&#xD;
sparkling purple air, the blue, misty hills in&#xD;
which the birthplace of the Empress Josephine&#xD;
is pointed out to strangers, seemed marvellous-&#xD;
ly close at hand, while the foreground of the&#xD;
coast, with its shining beach, its feathery&#xD;
palms, its fields of Bugar-cane, and its pictu-&#xD;
resque country-houses, tunde 'a picture never to&#xD;
be forgotten. Of the nearer mountains, robed&#xD;
in the gorgeous robes of tropical verdure, there&#xD;
are no words to speak! And then the sea,&#xD;
the divine, translucent sea! Ah, it was a&#xD;
thing of which to dream; stretching away in&#xD;
lustrous calm beneath a sky like a vault of&#xD;
sapphire, yet changing and shifting in opales-&#xD;
cent glory with every ray of light which the&#xD;
sun sent through the wide world of space to&#xD;
kiss its laughing waters!&#xD;
The quiet little town of Fort de France&#xD;
looked as quiet as tropical towns always look&#xD;
after sunrise and before sunset, when Alan&#xD;
reached it. The St. Amand residence-by&#xD;
name Lieu Ddsir6-was ~a f~ miles distant,&#xD;
and, the climate rendering pedestrian exercise&#xD;
out of the question, it Was some time before&#xD;
the young knight-errant could find any mode&#xD;
of conveyance to the shrine which he had&#xD;
made up his mind to visit. At last, however,&#xD;
his efforts were crowned with success, and he&#xD;
set forth in the face of a heat which inhabit-&#xD;
ants of the temperate zone would find it hard to&#xD;
associate with the thought of January. But&#xD;
sunstroke, like hydrophobia, is fortunately un-&#xD;
'known in the tropics, and the roads, like every&#xD;
&#xD;
thing else in the island, were admirable. Leav-&#xD;
ing the town and the beach behind, Alan soon&#xD;
found himself in the open country. To one&#xD;
less absent in mind, less heavy in heart, the&#xD;
ride would have been like a glimpse of fairy-&#xD;
land, like something too bright and magical for&#xD;
reality; 'the eye was charmed at every step by&#xD;
some new vista of ~chantment, ~ome new com-&#xD;
bination of trees and shrubs, while on every&#xD;
hand gorgeous creepers and parasites seemed&#xD;
running riot in very wantonness; eventhe fields&#xD;
of sugar-cane and the red-tiled countryLhouses&#xD;
adding to the general impression of abounding&#xD;
beauty in form and color. The road, for&#xD;
some distance, at least, was of a quality that&#xD;
would have done credit to a colonial Baron&#xD;
llaussman. In fact, it was more of an avenue&#xD;
than a road, macadamized to perfect smooth-&#xD;
ness, and lined with the magnificent shade-&#xD;
trees of the tropics-gigantic cactuses and&#xD;
waving palms making an archway overhead&#xD;
like the groined roof of a cathedral&#xD;
On approaching a spur of the hills, on a&#xD;
ridge of which Lieu D6sir6 was situated, the&#xD;
path, however, grew less even, and the scenery&#xD;
changed greatly in character, becoming more&#xD;
bold, though scarcely less luxuriant, and unit-&#xD;
ing the grandeur of a mountain-region with&#xD;
the glowing verdure of the tropical belt, in a&#xD;
manner' which defies all description. Sad and&#xD;
more sad as Alan felt, he could not but halt&#xD;
now and then to gaze in silent rapture on the&#xD;
marvellous wealth of loveliness around him.&#xD;
Grand hill-sides rose over him, crowned by&#xD;
plumy sentinels, and covered by broad succu-&#xD;
lent leaves and myriad flowers - fairy-like&#xD;
clefts and ravines opened on every' side, giving&#xD;
glimpses and suggestions of beauty, such a~&#xD;
no words could paint-now and then there&#xD;
was a distant view of the sea, then a flashing&#xD;
stream sent up a shower of silver spray as it&#xD;
tumbled over a precipice, or sang to itself with&#xD;
a sweet, rippling murmur, as it glided far away&#xD;
into the dim, aromatic recesses of the forest.&#xD;
Everywhere flaunted the wide leaves of the&#xD;
cactus, everywhere drooped the graceful foliage&#xD;
of the palm, everywhere shone the passionate-&#xD;
hued flowers-crimson and scarlet, golden and&#xD;
purple-of this land of the sun; and every-&#xD;
where a sweet, spicy fragrance came, like the&#xD;
soft south wind, on "subtle wings of balm," to&#xD;
add to the intoxication of the senses.&#xD;
"It is no wonder that my darling is an ar-&#xD;
tist!" thought Alan-forgetting how many are&#xD;
born in the midst of this lavish glory, for whom&#xD;
&#xD;
it has no more meaning or expression than sun-&#xD;
light to the blind.&#xD;
When he reached Lieu D6sir6, he found a&#xD;
graceful and airy country-house, on the usual&#xD;
tropical model-colonnades without number,&#xD;
perfect irregularity of outline, French windows&#xD;
opening on every side of the ground, and a&#xD;
court-yard containing a fountain, overhung by&#xD;
orange and lemon trees, of which he had often&#xD;
heard Ermine speak. He was admitted with-&#xD;
out difficulty-thanks to M. Delaroche's letter&#xD;
-and as he roamed through the spacious, ele-&#xD;
gant rooms, and the wide, empty galleries, the&#xD;
very echo of his footsteps seemed to addto&#xD;
the mournfulness of his heart. How often in&#xD;
that brief; golden month of their happiness,&#xD;
had Ermine and himself talked of her tropical&#xD;
home, hqw often had she dwelt on every detail&#xD;
of its loveliness, and how often they had pict-&#xD;
ured the manner in which they would live&#xD;
here-together!&#xD;
Now he stood on the threshold-a stranger&#xD;
and alone!&#xD;
Well, it was bitter, but men's hearts are&#xD;
tough, and Alan's did not break, however&#xD;
much it might throb and ache. Oh, those&#xD;
creams of which they had spok~n-drcams&#xD;
never to be made reality! Oh, those&#xD;
"Days of summer-colored seas,&#xD;
Days of many melodies,"&#xD;
which they had lived in fancy, and would never&#xD;
live in fact! Could any sting of earth be&#xD;
sharper than their mockery now? They&#xD;
seemed to haunt him, as he roame~l to and fro,&#xD;
through the house ~nd over the garden, drink-&#xD;
ing in the glorious prospect on which l~rmine's&#xD;
baby-eyes had opened first, and longing, poor&#xD;
fellow! with heart-sick longing, to be some-&#xD;
where-beyond the blue sea and blue sky-at&#xD;
rest from this gnawing pain.&#xD;
"Am I mad?" he thought, sitting down&#xD;
under the orange-tree of which he had heard&#xD;
Ermine speak most often-the one whose&#xD;
golden fruit brushed her casement-" does&#xD;
every man love like this? What is life to me&#xD;
now that she has gone oat of it? Nothing!&#xD;
less than nothing !-save for its duties; and&#xD;
they still remain to be fought out to the end.&#xD;
I should be glad. to fling the useless burden&#xD;
down into the dust. I would fling it down at&#xD;
her feet, God knows, if by such a means I&#xD;
could spare her one pang. Oh, my darling!&#xD;
my darling! my fair, stainless, gentle lily!&#xD;
what devil's art has come between us and torn&#xD;
&#xD;
from you the one man in the world who would&#xD;
give his heart's blood to serve you!"&#xD;
Alas! answer there was nonc. Serenely&#xD;
the fair sky looked down, serenely the fountain&#xD;
sent up its soft murmur and misty spray, se-&#xD;
renely the glossy leaves rustled overhead, and&#xD;
the cry ofthe passionate human love fell back&#xD;
on the passionate human heart like the unalter-&#xD;
able sentence of God.&#xD;
After a while he rose and went into the&#xD;
house. One more last glance around the dainty&#xD;
room which the cicerone (with whose services&#xD;
he had dispensed) told him was "madame's&#xD;
boudoir," and then he would be ready to say&#xD;
good-by forever to this fair, tropical paradise,&#xD;
this sweet, empty nest from which the bird had&#xD;
flown.&#xD;
Round and round this room he wandered.'&#xD;
It was so hard to go! Some aroma of her&#xD;
presence seemed to his fancy to linger here, and&#xD;
it was almost like the pain of farewell to leave&#xD;
it. Every thing in the room he touched with&#xD;
tender reverence, the tall Parian vases which&#xD;
he could fancy her hands filling with flowers,&#xD;
the keys of the piano over which her fingers&#xD;
had moved, the table on which her writing.&#xD;
desk and work-box had evidently stood, and&#xD;
the deep, luxurious chair in which he could&#xD;
almost see her slender figure nestling On a&#xD;
ccuch near the chair, he sat down for a few&#xD;
minutes, and, as he did so, displaced a cushion&#xD;
evidently placed to support the head of a re-&#xD;
cumbent figure. Under the cushion lay abook&#xD;
which he took up-not because he cared in-&#xD;
trinsically for any hook under the sun-but&#xD;
because Ermine's hand had n&amp;amp;doubt placed it&#xD;
there. Turning over the leaves absently, he&#xD;
saw that it was a novel,, and that there were&#xD;
two marks between the pages-one of these&#xD;
was a faded flower which he gently kissed; the&#xD;
other, a card on which was written a few words&#xD;
in pencil-brief yet in a measure significant,&#xD;
since but for them the description of this visit&#xD;
might have been consigned to the class of&#xD;
"All the fine books that have neverbeen written,&#xD;
And all the brightthingsthat havenever been said."&#xD;
Still absently, Alan glanced at these pent&#xD;
cilled words; but, as his eye fell on them, some.&#xD;
thing like light and life flashed into it. "By&#xD;
Jove!" he said half aloud. Then he turned&#xD;
the bit of pasteboard several times over, read&#xD;
the inscription again, pondered a while, finally&#xD;
took out his pocket-book and carefully stored&#xD;
it away. After this he rose, and, with one last&#xD;

glance around the vacant shrine, went out with&#xD;
something almost approaching to alacrity. In&#xD;
his state, a straw depresses or raises that&#xD;
subde mercury which we call the spirits;&#xD;
and this straw had been beneficial in its ef-&#xD;
fect.&#xD;
Yet if anybody wonders what it was, there&#xD;
lane need to make a mystery of such a trifle&#xD;
.-trifle, at least,, to all appearance-for those&#xD;
few words in pencil merely jotted down a Paris&#xD;
address. To some people this would not have&#xD;
meant very much, but to Alan it meant a great&#xD;
deal, for ii~ knew that this card had been mis-&#xD;
placed through carelessness or mistake, and&#xD;
that it was to tide address in Paris that Er-&#xD;
mine must have gone. We have spoken of&#xD;
his dogged fidelity and tenacity of purpose be-&#xD;
fore; it is almost useless, therefore, to say that&#xD;
this fruitless voyage to Martinique had not&#xD;
damped his resolution to see his lost love, and&#xD;
"learn the truth from her own lips," and that&#xD;
he was still determined to follow her to France,&#xD;
or, if need be, to Persia. But France is a large&#xD;
country, and has a considerable number of&#xD;
feminine inhabitants. A search through the&#xD;
country at large would have been rather vague&#xD;
-almost as vague as that of Japhet for his&#xD;
father-and therefore we see the importance&#xD;
of that forgotten card, left in the novel with&#xD;
which Madame Erie had whiled away some&#xD;
languid siesta.&#xD;
When Alan returned to Fort do France, the&#xD;
sun had gone down-sinking like a great ball&#xD;
of fire into the placid, azure ocean-and the&#xD;
world of Fort do France had begun to bestir&#xD;
itself~ the first gentle movement of the land-&#xD;
breeze having ended the reign of heat and&#xD;
wakened that multitudinous insect choir which&#xD;
the katydid leads. Poor Nix had been left at&#xD;
the hotel (the heavy weight of hair which he&#xD;
carried making pedestrian exercise under a&#xD;
tropical sun impossible ~or Aim), and woe-&#xD;
begone enough he looked as he lay with&#xD;
his enormous muzzle on his leonine paws,&#xD;
waiting and listening through many long hours&#xD;
for his master's return. When that master&#xD;
came, he rewarded his patience with the thing&#xD;
which Nix liked, next best to a swim-a walk.&#xD;
A military band was playing at the .?'lace&#xD;
d'Arme2, and thither Alan bent his steps. It&#xD;
was necessary to lounge somewhere, and this&#xD;
was as good a place as any other-or better&#xD;
p~rhlLps.&#xD;
If he had been in anotherr mood, he would&#xD;
have asked nothing b~ghter or more attractive&#xD;
&#xD;
than the scene which he found, for the Place&#xD;
d'Arrnes is situated on the very margin of the&#xD;
bay; and, in the midst of the graceful, well-&#xD;
dressed throng who loitered to and fro, Alan&#xD;
took Nix down the beach and gave him his&#xD;
heart's delight, a sei~mper in the rippling tide,&#xD;
Many bright glanc4s f%~lowed the handsome&#xD;
stranger and his su orb companion; but even&#xD;
these fair countrywomen of Ermine and the&#xD;
Empress Josephine could not win a glance&#xD;
from those abstracted eyes, or quicken interest&#xD;
in the abstracted face. Yet the scene was&#xD;
very fair, and sometimes came back with pict-&#xD;
ure-like distinctness to his memory; the rip.&#xD;
pling music of the tide on its smooth, pebbly&#xD;
beach, the martial strains of the band, the&#xD;
laughter of rosy lips, the sound of sweet voices,&#xD;
the lovely bay with its anchored ships, the dis-&#xD;
tant ocean in its twilight veil, the silver sickle&#xD;
of a new moon over the background of moun-&#xD;
tains, the heavy drooping verdure lightly&#xD;
swayed by the fragrant breath of the newly-&#xD;
risen land-breeze, and, above all, the pict-&#xD;
uresque assembly, the dark-eyed creole ladies,&#xD;
full of French grace, and clad in French toi-&#xD;
lets, the army and naval officers in their gleam-&#xD;
ing uniforms, the priests in cassocks, a siste~&#xD;
of charity in her white headdress followed by&#xD;
a merry crew of children, here and there a&#xD;
flower-girl, or vendor of sherbet and ice-cream.&#xD;
It was a picture worth hanging in the gal-&#xD;
lery of memory, and, as Alan went back to his&#xD;
hotel, he could not be sorry that he would&#xD;
carry away one such scene to gild with its&#xD;
brightness the remembrance of Ermine's birth-&#xD;
place.&#xD;

CPTER v~.&#xD;
A NEW CHAMPION.&#xD;
Or all things in the world, a day of early,&#xD;
opening spring is the most enticing. To make&#xD;
a slight parody on Dr. Johnson's famous re-&#xD;
mark about Marathon and baa, I do not envy&#xD;
the sentiments of the man, or woman, or child,&#xD;
Or horse, or dog, or cat, or rabbit, or any thing&#xD;
that has eyes in its head and blood in its veins,&#xD;
that does not feel in every fibre the divine ex-&#xD;
altation of such a day! Who can willingly&#xD;
stay in-doors during its bright hours? Who&#xD;
does not long to bathe in the tinted sunlight, to&#xD;
inhale the sweet fragrance of violets, to listen to&#xD;
the merry chirp of birds, to be as merry and&#xD;
chirp as loudly as they, perhaps, to fling care&#xD;
&#xD;
to the winds, to feel the magical softness of th&#xD;
purple air on cheek and brow, to watch thE&#xD;
opening ~blossoms and bursting buds, to pull&#xD;
tiny, feathery leaves off' the trees, and, in short&#xD;
to be thoroughly pastoral and happy and&#xD;
foolish. fov once in life? And if people feel&#xD;
this everywhere, how much more do they feel&#xD;
it in Paris-Paris, where the only question is,&#xD;
what place of sweet idleness' to choose!&#xD;
The gay sunshine of such a day was gilding&#xD;
with a flood of glory the palaces and gardens,&#xD;
the arches and columns, the boulevards and&#xD;
bridges of that fairest of all fair cities, when a&#xD;
lady, dressed evidently for promenade or driv-&#xD;
ing, stood at the window of a pleasant saloon&#xD;
overlooking a handsome, bu~y Paris street.&#xD;
The lady was young, taIl, slender, and dark.&#xD;
eyed; the saloon was imposing and luxurious,&#xD;
full of long mirrors, and cabinets, and vases,&#xD;
while the hangings and furniture were all of&#xD;
white-and-gold. It seemed a fitting shrine for&#xD;
the stately creature who moved slowly to one&#xD;
of the mirrors tad stood th~re knotting into&#xD;
negligent grace the lace strings of her bonnet,&#xD;
while the silvery tint of her costume seemed in&#xD;
harmony with the tender budding verdure and&#xD;
the soft. blue sky outside. She had arranged&#xD;
the strings to her satisfaction, and was~begin-&#xD;
ing to draw on her gloves, when a sudden peal&#xD;
of the door-bell made her start. She frowned'&#xD;
a little and stood listening with her head&#xD;
slightly bent, while something of an altercation&#xD;
went on between thc visitor who rang the bell&#xD;
and the servant who answered it. Finally the&#xD;
latter brought in a card.&#xD;
"Would madame look at this?" he asked,&#xD;
in a somewhat injured tone. The gentleman&#xD;
was very persistent. He insisted upon seeing&#xD;
madame, and would take no denial. He was&#xD;
the same gentleman who had called twice the&#xD;
day before, and to whom, on both occasions,&#xD;
madame had been denied.&#xD;
Madame looked at the card and frowned&#xD;
"Did you tell him' Not at home? '~she&#xD;
naked.&#xD;
"I 'told him so several times, madame."&#xD;
"And what did he say?"&#xD;
"He said he would wait at the porte-cockire&#xD;
till madame came in, or-.-.went out."&#xD;
At this~ madame stamped her pretty&#xD;
foot.&#xD;
"How dare he be so insolent?" she cried~&#xD;
"I will not submit to it! I will not be perse-&#xD;
outed in this manner, or be blockaded at my&#xD;
&#xD;
own door! I will call in the police first-you&#xD;
may tell him so, Joan."&#xD;
"Oni, madame," said Jean, quietly, and&#xD;
walked toward the door.&#xD;
But cooler reflection prevailed in madame's&#xD;
I mind before he had more than half crossed the&#xD;
polished floor. She called him back, and then&#xD;
asked quickly-&#xD;
"Did he say any thing else?"&#xD;
"He asked to see Madame Villarot," an-&#xD;
swered Jean, still quietly, "but I preferred to&#xD;
speak to madame first."&#xD;
"Then why did you not speak to me,&#xD;
stupid?" demanded madame, impatiently.&#xD;
"That is just the thing! He shall see Madame&#xD;
Villarot. Why did I not think of that sooner?&#xD;
Admit him at once," she went on, "while I go&#xD;
and toll my aunt."&#xD;
As Jean walked out of the saloon by one&#xD;
door, the lady left it by another. It was as&#xD;
close a thing as possible-as close as we some-&#xD;
times see in dramatic situations on the stage-&#xD;
for the latter' door had scarcely closed on her&#xD;
silvery draperies, when the former door&#xD;
opened as Jean admitted the persistent visi-&#xD;
tor.&#xD;
This visitor, it is scarcely necessary to say,&#xD;
was the tall, bronzed gentleman whom we saw&#xD;
last in the Pla~ie d'Armes of distant Fort do&#xD;
France-the gentleman who had found the ad-&#xD;
dress of these charming apartments auprimier,&#xD;
under a sofa-cushion in the boudoir of Lieu&#xD;
D~sird-who looked a trifle paler than he had&#xD;
done in the tropics, but who sat down quietly&#xD;
in the midst of thes~ Parisian splendors to wait&#xD;
for Madame Villarot.&#xD;
After a short interval-during which he&#xD;
heard a band playing away in the garden of&#xD;
the Tuileries near by-the door of the saloon&#xD;
agailx opened and admitted a slender, elegant&#xD;
woman of middle age, dressed exquisitely in&#xD;
half-mourning, with something about her clear&#xD;
features and dark eyes which, reminding him&#xD;
of both Ermine and Madelon, proved that,&#xD;
whatever she was now called, she had been&#xD;
born St. Amand.&#xD;
Alan rose to his feet, and, as he looked at&#xD;
the pale, high-bred face before him, something&#xD;
like reassurance crept into his heart. There&#xD;
are some people who seem to carry in their&#xD;
mere presence the most eloquent assertion&#xD;
of that grand old motto-.Ybblesse obli~ye. Of&#xD;
these, Madame Villarot was one. No man&#xD;
could see her and believe for a moment that&#xD;
she could ever be made an active or passive&#xD;

agent in any deception, far less in any fraud.&#xD;
0niy to look at her was sufficient conviction&#xD;
that her white, blue-veined, aristocratic hands&#xD;
were not less stainless in reality than ii~ seem-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
"With such a woman as this," thought&#xD;
Alan, "my way will be clear."&#xD;
"Madame," he began, respectfully, "I&#xD;
have been bold enough to beg the favor of an&#xD;
interview with yourself because I have been&#xD;
denied all access to your niece, Madame Erle.&#xD;
It is her whom I desire to see; but, failing&#xD;
this, I should like to know her reason for de-&#xD;
clining to hold any communication with me."&#xD;
"As far as I can judge, monsieur," said the&#xD;
sady, in pure Parisian French, w'~ich made&#xD;
Alan exceedingly conscious of his own short-&#xD;
comings in the matter of language, "my niece&#xD;
is acting very prudently and with my entire&#xD;
~probation in declining to see you. Will&#xD;
you allow me to inquire in turn what possible&#xD;
reason you can have for persecuting her as&#xD;
you have done within the lasttwo days?"&#xD;
"Persecuting her!" repeated Alan, while&#xD;
a sudden flush dyed his sunburnt face. "Par-&#xD;
don me, madame, but I cannot think that Er-&#xD;
mine-that Madame ErIe regards my desire to&#xD;
see her in the light of persecution! If so-"&#xD;
He stopped suddenly, and swallowed his&#xD;
indignant words with a gulp.&#xD;
"If so," said Madame Villarot, seeing her&#xD;
advantage and following it up with a very gra-&#xD;
cious smile, "I am sure th~t monsieur is too&#xD;
much of a gentleman to pain or distress any&#xD;
one-especially a woman whom he may have&#xD;
loved."&#xD;
"A woman whom I do love, madame," cor-&#xD;
rected monsieur, coolly, " and whom I have&#xD;
followed across the Atlantic that I may learn&#xD;
from her own lips the truth concerning her&#xD;
marriage. Have you heard my story, ma-&#xD;
dame?" he went on, "or shall I weary you if I&#xD;
repeat it? Otherwise my conduct may seem&#xD;
to you to need an excuse."&#xD;
"I have heard the outline~ of your story,&#xD;
monsieur," answered Madame ~Villarot, kindly,&#xD;
"and I willingly grant to you all the excuse&#xD;
which you ~ay desire to claim. But do you&#xD;
not see that you are too late ~ The marriage-&#xD;
knots once tied, cannot be ui~tied, and what&#xD;
good, therefore, could ensue from explanation&#xD;
*   of what is past?  Harm, rather, might-nay,&#xD;
would-follow if you met Ermine. She herself&#xD;
shrinks from the meeting. Can you not realize&#xD;
this feeling, and generously respect it? Sure-&#xD;
&#xD;
ly, if you love her, you must desire to serve&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"God knows that I desire nothing else,'~&#xD;
said Alan, gravely.&#xD;
"Then, monsieur," said the lady, with her&#xD;
dark, eloquent eyes fastened full on him, "as&#xD;
a gentleman and as a Christian, leave ker. I,&#xD;
who have a woman's heart to feel and to sym-&#xD;
pathize with you-I, who admire and respect&#xD;
your rare fidelity-I bid you do this in that&#xD;
holy Name which you have invoked! If you&#xD;
love her, you are the last man in the world&#xD;
who should linger by her side, or look into&#xD;
her eyes! You are the last man in the world&#xD;
who should bring dissension between herself&#xD;
and the man to whom she gave her hand be-&#xD;
fore God's holy altar!"&#xD;
"She was mine before she was his!" said&#xD;
Alan, fiercely. "She has been stolen from&#xD;
me! Madame, madame, do not try to make&#xD;
me believe that I have not a right to say to&#xD;
her what I will!"&#xD;
"It is not necessary for me to try to make&#xD;
you believe it," said Madame Villarot, still&#xD;
kindly, still gently; "your own conscience,&#xD;
-your own sense of right and wrong-speak&#xD;
to you with more authority than my feeble&#xD;
voice. Monsieur, I pity you from my soul,&#xD;
for I see the fight which you will have to&#xD;
wage-and it is a fight in which there can be&#xD;
no compromise. Now, listen to me-you ac-&#xD;
knowledge that you love my niece?"&#xD;
"Yes," said Alan, bitterly, "one does not&#xD;
unlearn the lesson of a lifetime in a few&#xD;
months."&#xD;
"You acknowledge also that she is mar-&#xD;
ried-why or how, does not matter. It i~&#xD;
enough that, being married, she is irrevocably&#xD;
lost to you."&#xD;
"Yes," said he, between his set teeth. "I&#xD;
acknowledge that. She is irrevocably lost to&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"Then," said the lady, "realizing these&#xD;
things, why do you still wish to see her?&#xD;
What end can you possibly desire to gain by'&#xD;
distracting her mind and harrowing her heart&#xD;
by a last interview-which," she added, with&#xD;
keen, worldly wisdom, "if once granted, would&#xD;
not be the last."&#xD;
"I desire one thing, madame, which you&#xD;
have not taken into account," said he, almost&#xD;
sternly-" that is, revenge! You are a wom-&#xD;
an-a good one, I am sure," he added, ear-&#xD;
nestly-" therefore, it is impossible for you to&#xD;
imagine the manner in which a man's thoughts&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
turn instinctively to that resource, when he&#xD;
has been injured beyond hope of cure. I&#xD;
know that there has been some black villany&#xD;
in this work-and I will yet lay my hand on&#xD;
it. But Ermine alone can enable me to do&#xD;
this."&#xD;
"And what would you think of Ermine if&#xD;
she gave you the information you desire,&#xD;
if, in so doing, she turned against the man&#xD;
who, whether for good or for evil, is her hus-&#xD;
band?"&#xD;
"You don't see-you don't understand__"&#xD;
he broke out, vehemently.&#xD;
But a white, slender hand, raised for a mo-&#xD;
meut, stayed the words on his lips.&#xD;
"Believe me, I understand perfectly," said&#xD;
Madame Villarot, gravely. "Ah, yours is no&#xD;
new casjs. We all agree that moral laws arc&#xD;
very useful things as long as they do not hind&#xD;
our own inclinations. When they do this,&#xD;
however, we all think that we have some ex-&#xD;
ceptionally good reason for bursting them&#xD;
asunder. Monsieur, I am sure that you are&#xD;
honorable, and I think that you will prove&#xD;
reasonable-therefore, I speak to you plainly.&#xD;
I entered this room inclined in a measure to&#xD;
your side-thinking that Ermine might con-&#xD;
sent to see you-once at least. I recognize&#xD;
now that she was wiser than I. She distrusts&#xD;
herself-no doubt with good cause. She dis~&#xD;
trusts you-no doubt with better cause yet.&#xD;
The interview, she says, would be acutely pain-&#xD;
ful to her. I see now that it would be worse&#xD;
than painful-it would be dangerous. Such&#xD;
passions as yours are not made for playthings.&#xD;
You must go! Being a gentleman, being a&#xD;
Christian, you will go! And, if you are wise,&#xD;
you will put land and sea between yourself&#xD;
and this woman whom you love, and who is&#xD;
now separated from you-irrevocably."&#xD;
We have all of us heard of personal&#xD;
magnetism, and once or twice in life we may&#xD;
have met it, as Alan met it now in this fair,&#xD;
graceful Frenchwoman. Whether the power&#xD;
was in herself or in the words which she ut-&#xD;
teredit is bard to say. But power of a cer-&#xD;
tain subtle kind existed in every glance of her&#xD;
eye, every accent of her voice-power which&#xD;
it was impossible even for his obstinate will to&#xD;
resist. Like wax exposed to the white heat&#xD;
of fire, his fierce passion and steadfast resolve&#xD;
seemed to melt away before the simple words&#xD;
ok' this stranger-tlifwoman whom half an&#xD;
hour before he had never seen. When she laid&#xD;
her delicate, thorough-bred hand down upon his,&#xD;
&#xD;
in the energy of herlast word, he felt as if the'&#xD;
blackness of despair were gathering round hint&#xD;
-as if; indeed, she left him no alternative but&#xD;
to go.&#xD;
"Madame," said he, after a paus~ "you&#xD;
are right--I am wrong. I have acted and&#xD;
wished to act like a mad fool. God forgive&#xD;
me if; in trying to serve Ermine, I have only&#xD;
pained and injured her! I see that I must re-&#xD;
sign the hope of avenging her wrongs, since'&#xD;
the blow which struck Qthers would, in a.&#xD;
measure, recoil upon herself. But, madame-"&#xD;
and Madame Villarot never forgot the passion-&#xD;
ate eyes which met her own here-" when a&#xD;
man is going forth on a long journey, never to&#xD;
return, can you deny him one farewell? Can&#xD;
it injure any one if he looks his last into the&#xD;
eyes which have been the sweetest eyes in the&#xD;
world to him for many years, or if he clasps&#xD;
the hand which has lain in his a thousand&#xD;
times, and was to have been l~is own? I&#xD;
promise y6u that I will say nothing which the&#xD;
whole world might not hear. Only let me bid&#xD;
adieu" (if he had been speaking his native&#xD;
tongue, he would have said "good-by," but&#xD;
there is no equivalent for that sweet word in&#xD;
the French language) "to the one light of my&#xD;
life-and go."&#xD;
Ah, love makes poets as well as fools of us&#xD;
all! There was not in the world-in that fine,,&#xD;
English-speaking world which has set its surly'&#xD;
face against "sentiment "-a more practical.&#xD;
person in the ordinary affairs of life, than Alan.&#xD;
Thie. But his love for Ermine had been, in-&#xD;
deed, and in a different sense from that in.&#xD;
which Byron meant the expression, "of his.&#xD;
life a thing apart." This life had been like a.&#xD;
rough cloth, strong in fibre and coarse in&#xD;
grain, but through which there ran a single&#xD;
golden thread-the poetry of a love which the&#xD;
rare, sweet nature of its object exalted above'&#xD;
the ordinary passion which bears that much&#xD;
abused name. So, when he made an appeal to&#xD;
say good-by to that love forever, the love it-&#xD;
self loosed his tongue, and inspired the words&#xD;
whose unconscious eloquence Madame Villarot&#xD;
long remembered. "Ah 1" she would often&#xD;
say in speaking of him, "believe me, there was&#xD;
a chevalier ~f Nature's own making-a gener-.&#xD;
ous nature, a faithful heart, a love such as we&#xD;
do not discover in the fine gentlemen of our&#xD;
nineteenth century. T4ey fritter away their'&#xD;
hearts (or whatever is supposed to do duty&#xD;
for their hearts) on a hundred different follies&#xD;
and fancies, until a feeble liking is all that..&#xD;

92                        EBB-TIDE.                                                          DRAMATIC CAPABILITIES.               93&#xD;
&#xD;
they have left to give .to any one; but that&#xD;
man-there was passion which deserved the&#xD;
name in him!"&#xD;
She did not say this to the " chevalier" in&#xD;
question, though-she only shook her head&#xD;
and gazed at him with kind, steadfast eyes.&#xD;
"Be brave!" she said. "Do not ask it.&#xD;
Go without it. You do not realize-you can't&#xD;
imagine-how mueh harder it would make the&#xD;
separation. You would transform a wound&#xD;
which is closing-I do not say healing-into&#xD;
one which would be open and gaping. ~o,&#xD;
my friend, no! Be generous-be courageous&#xD;
-go!"&#xD;
"I must see Eer-I wilt see her!" said he,&#xD;
hoarsely. "You shall Dot keep her from me!&#xD;
My God! madame, have you no heart, that a&#xD;
you cannot even grant me this 1"'&#xD;
"It is because I have a heart 'that I refuse&#xD;
it," answered she, gently. "Monsieur, do you&#xD;
know what you ask! When you do know,&#xD;
you will thank me for standing between you&#xD;
and your own desire. Once more I warn you&#xD;
that this passion of yours is no plaything. On&#xD;
the contrary, it is a mine of gunpowder which&#xD;
one spark will ignite-and I know enough of&#xD;
human nature to be sure that one sight of Er.&#xD;
mine (whom you acknowledge you have not&#xD;
seen for nine months) would prove such a&#xD;
spark. Therefore, no such meeting shall take&#xD;
place within my doors, and I am sure you are&#xD;
too chivalrous a gentleman to meet my niece&#xD;
elsewhere."&#xD;
"0 madame," said he, bitterly, "do not&#xD;
trust to my chivalry in such a matter as this.&#xD;
I would set aside any thing-break through&#xD;
any law-to reach Ermine. She is mine! I&#xD;
have a right to meet her when and where I&#xD;
will!"&#xD;
"Not against 'her ow~i will," said Madame&#xD;
Villarot, gravely. "Your chivalry will grant&#xD;
that much, I am sure-especially when I pledge&#xD;
my word as a Christian, and my honor as a&#xD;
Frenchwomanthatthe thing ofallothers which&#xD;
Ermine is most anxious to avoid i~ an inter-&#xD;
view with yourself. The fear of meeting you&#xD;
has kept her a prisoner in, the house ever&#xD;
since you~have bcei~ in Paris. Now, will you&#xD;
force this which she dreads upon her? Will&#xD;
you distract her mind, which has settled itself&#xD;
to accept the inevitable 1' Will you inflict&#xD;
pain upon yourself, and worse pain upon her,&#xD;
merely to gratify your own desire? Monsieur,&#xD;
I think not."&#xD;
Again she conquered. He looked at her&#xD;
&#xD;
for a moment with a pale, blank face-then&#xD;
quietly rose to his feet.&#xD;
"Madame," said he, simply, "you have&#xD;
left me nothing to say-but farewell. I shall&#xD;
leave your doors a little wiser than when I en-&#xD;
tered them, and   shall leave Paris to-night.&#xD;
Your niece, therefore, need no longer be a&#xD;
prisoner on my account. If you ~cll her any&#xD;
thing f~om me let it simply be 'find bless her!'&#xD;
For course~ I shall never forget the generous&#xD;
kindness and sympathy with which you have&#xD;
received and listened to me. The reward,&#xD;
your own heart must give you. Adieu."&#xD;
She held out her hand, and, as if he had&#xD;
been born and bred in France, he bent and&#xD;
kissed it.&#xD;
"Monsieur," said she, gently, "take with&#xD;
you not my pity, but my admiration. Out of&#xD;
such stuff as you heroes are made!"&#xD;
They were brave, gracious words, and, as he&#xD;
passed out, they went with him like a cordial.&#xD;
But for them, his strength might have failed&#xD;
when the door closed behind him, and he felt&#xD;
that the last strand of hope had slipped from&#xD;
his grasp.&#xD;
Meanwhile, it is hard to say what Madame&#xD;
Villarot would have thought if she had only&#xD;
seen, in its true colors, the cause in which she&#xD;
had fought and triumphed. Pure and noble&#xD;
lady that she was, we may be sure 'that it&#xD;
would have gone bitterly hard with her to&#xD;
know that her efforts had turned the scale of&#xD;
victory for wrong against right, for treachery&#xD;
against truth. Yet she might have consoled&#xD;
herself by the reflection that she had battled&#xD;
not for an individual merely, but for an ab-&#xD;
stract principle-and that principles never&#xD;
change. Yet it was at least a strange freak&#xD;
of circumstance which thus arrayed such a&#xD;
champion on such a side, and lent such stain-&#xD;
less weapons to such a warfare. But then it&#xD;
not unseldom happens "in this riddling world"&#xD;
that weapons stainless as hers are unsheathed&#xD;
to do battle for some cause 'which cloaks the&#xD;
malicious form of a demon under the stolen&#xD;
raiment of an angel of God!&#xD;
When Madame Villarot went to the chain-&#xD;
'ber of her niece, she found her sitting by an&#xD;
open window, with the quivering sunlight&#xD;
pouring down upon her idly-clasped hands,&#xD;
her shining dress, her rich, dark hair (the&#xD;
bonnet had been laid aside), and her white,&#xD;
sculptured face. The immobility of the attitude&#xD;
ruek. the elder woman with pain, as she&#xD;
enteredd the room-and, crossing the floor, she&#xD;
&#xD;
said a few words-purposely tender-hoping&#xD;
that tears might break through this rigid calm.&#xD;
But no tears came. Gravely, quietly, without a&#xD;
movement of feature, or of glance, the girl heard&#xD;
the circumstantial account of the interview-&#xD;
and, when it was ended, she said in a low, even&#xD;
i~oice:&#xD;
"Thank you, ma tante, for your great&#xD;
goodness and kindness-to him as well as to&#xD;
me. Now, if you will not think me ungrateful,&#xD;
will you add one favor to the rest? 'Will&#xD;
you leave me, and see that I am not disturbed&#xD;
until dinner?"&#xD;
"But, my child, you were going to drive&#xD;
with me," said Madame Villarot, kindly. "Do&#xD;
you not think it woula do you more good than&#xD;
staying here alone?"&#xD;
"Nqt if you will excuse me. My head&#xD;
aches, and I should like to be alone."&#xD;
"At least let Clemence stay with you.&#xD;
You may need something."&#xD;
"I prefer to be alone," wus the answer.&#xD;
Then with passionately uplifted eyes,&#xD;
dear aunt, grant me to-day! To-morrow I&#xD;
will be all you wish!"&#xD;
"My child, do as you please-~-.no one,~sall&#xD;
disturb you," said Madame Villarot, gently.&#xD;
Then she bent down, kissed the white brow,&#xD;
and gently rustled from the room.&#xD;
"After all, the child is wise," she thought&#xD;
-"wise to take it in this way. Perhaps it is&#xD;
best to let her fight it out alone. She has a&#xD;
brave heart, and the holy angels are near to&#xD;
help her."&#xD;
Ah, sweet lady, near indeed-ever near-&#xD;
but bearing no part save that of sad spectators&#xD;
in such a conflict as this.&#xD;
Soon afterward , Madame Villarot drove&#xD;
away fro4 the pot~te.cock~re; and soon again,&#xD;
after that, a daintily-dressed lady, wearing a&#xD;
heavy veil, passed out of the same door, and&#xD;
took her away along the Rue Iloyale, across&#xD;
the Place de la Concorde, and into the open&#xD;
gates of the Tuileries, where a tall man and a&#xD;
large dog had entered not long before.&#xD;

CHAPTER VIL&#xD;
DRAMATIC CAPABILITIES.&#xD;
Tm~Tuilcries! Ali, what a chord of bitter&#xD;
grief and more bitter rage-to which there&#xD;
has come as yet no comfort-that name&#xD;
awakens! Alas for the beautiful palace, and&#xD;
&#xD;
its beautiful gardens! A1as, yet more, for&#xD;
that fair and noble France whose own un-&#xD;
grateful children have proved her bitterest&#xD;
and direst enemies! On that by-gone day of&#xD;
which I write, however, the bright spring sun-&#xD;
shine still slept on the stately column of the&#xD;
Place Vendbme, the imperial city still wore&#xD;
her crown of peerless beauty, the golden grain&#xD;
and the purple vintage still ripened peacefully&#xD;
on the broad plains of Normandy and the&#xD;
sunny hills of Provence, the noble fortresses&#xD;
of France still echoed the reveillv~ of French&#xD;
drums, and the royal fa9ade of the Tuileries&#xD;
still crowned its beautiful terraces, while its&#xD;
many windows gave back the sunshine in a&#xD;
blaze of glory, like an illumination over some&#xD;
great victory where French heroism and dar-&#xD;
ing had again received their baptism of blood!&#xD;
In the garden, with its fountains, and statues,&#xD;
and green arcades, soldiers still paced, military&#xD;
music played, the glittering crowd moved' to&#xD;
and fro; children, followed by white-capped&#xD;
nurses, scampered along the paths; people sat&#xD;
on the benches under the budding chestnut-&#xD;
trees, reading or gossipping, while numberless&#xD;
other people strolled past; birds twittered in&#xD;
the boughs, early spring flowers gleamed along&#xD;
the borders, and the fragrance of bursting buds&#xD;
seemed to fill the air ~ivith a delicious sense of&#xD;
Nature's awakening vitality.&#xD;
Fresh as Alan was from the enchanted&#xD;
tropical world, the beauty of the scene pleased&#xD;
and soothed him. Followed by Nix, whom he&#xD;
had not admitted to Madame Villarot's saloon,&#xD;
he strolled down one path after another, past&#xD;
merry groups of children playing hide-and-seek&#xD;
about the statues, past old gentlemen ani&#xD;
young gentlemen, past grand ladies, and ladies'&#xD;
who were not grand, finally paused for a mo-&#xD;
ment near the music, then rose and began to.&#xD;
stroll away again toward the Rue de Bivoli.&#xD;
But he had not taken many steps in this direc-&#xD;
tion, when a lady rose from a bench under the&#xD;
soft, flickering shade, and, lifting her veil with&#xD;
one hand, held out the, other.&#xD;
For an instant, Alan recoiled as if he had&#xD;
been shot. Ermine was so entirely in his&#xD;
thoughts, that, for the space of a second, he~&#xD;
almost thought she was before his sight-the&#xD;
graceful figure, the clear, white complexion,&#xD;
the delicate features, the large, dark eyes,&#xD;
making an ensemble strikingly like her own.&#xD;
Then he recognized Madelon Lautrec.&#xD;
"Madelon!" said he, eagerly, so surprised~&#xD;
and delighted to see her that he made one&#xD;

-quick step forward and clasped the extended&#xD;
htind in both his own-" what extraordinary&#xD;
good fortune that I should meet you-other-&#xD;
wise I might have left Paris without knowing&#xD;
'that you were here! What are you doing ?-&#xD;
where did'you come from ?"&#xD;
" Have I not a right to see the world as&#xD;
well as my betters ?" asked she, looking up at&#xD;
'him, with the bright, mocking smile which he&#xD;
well remembered, and which carried him back&#xD;
-to the familiar scenes in Charleston, as if by a&#xD;
flash. "Xa~ foi, M. le Capitaine, i'ailroads&#xD;
from every part of the world run into. Paris,&#xD;
~and for the rest-even a penniless maiden&#xD;
may enjoy a bench in the gardens of the&#xD;
-Tuileries for nothing!" ~&#xD;
"May she?" said he, smiling a little;&#xD;
"but then she must expect to share it, if an&#xD;
-old friend comes by. You will sit down again,&#xD;
won't you ? I have so much to say to you."&#xD;
-" Yes, I will sit down again," answered&#xD;
-she, lowering her veil, "but not just here.&#xD;
You must remember that we are not in&#xD;
Charleston now. My aunt wodld be shocked&#xD;
if she knew that I was in the open and fla-&#xD;
grant act .of talking with a man-absolutely a&#xD;
man-without any chaperone near by to over-.&#xD;
look my deportment. Under these circum-&#xD;
stances, I don't care to meet any of our ac-&#xD;
quaintances, and therefore I should prefer&#xD;
some more secluded part of the garden."&#xD;
"We can easily find one," said he. And,&#xD;
side by side, they walked away, leaving the&#xD;
mussic and the chief part of the glittering&#xD;
throng behind them.&#xD;
In Paris nobody is observed, unless it be a&#xD;
pretty woman quite alone, and they soon found&#xD;
'thenook of which they were in search, a pleasant&#xD;
'seat just large enough for two, under a spread-&#xD;
'ing horse-chestnut-tree, with a fountain play-.&#xD;
ing not far off; and a group of statuaryin front.&#xD;
As they sat down, Madelon felt sufficiently&#xD;
-secure to take off her veil, and Alan could not&#xD;
'forbear saying: -&#xD;
"You are handsomer than ever, Madelon,&#xD;
if that be possible."&#xD;
"Am I ?" asked she, with bright, half-&#xD;
lifted eyes. "I am so glad to herr it. I was&#xD;
always vain, you know, and never made a pre-&#xD;
tence of concealing my vanity, as most women&#xD;
~do. I am proud of my beaux yeux, and I mean&#xD;
to make them do me good service in this gay&#xD;
-orld of Paris. Ah, Alan," with a sigh, not of&#xD;
-pain but of deep enjoyment, "now I know what&#xD;
~It is to live. Before this, I have merely existed."&#xD;
&#xD;
rIDE.              (&#xD;
"When did you come here ?" asked he,&#xD;
absently, pulling Nix's silken ears as he spoke-.&#xD;
"About a month ago," answered she, then&#xD;
correcting herself with a blush, as he quickly&#xD;
looked up, " How foolish I am!I You mean, of&#xD;
course, when did I come to France. That was&#xD;
last November. But I came to Paris a month&#xD;
ago, to meet Ermine, who wrote that she&#xD;
would be here at that time."&#xD;
"Are you staying with Ermine ?" asked&#xD;
he, looking at her in some surprise.&#xD;
"Did you not know it ?" said she, re-&#xD;
turning the gaze with .eyes which did not&#xD;
blench or turn away. "Did not Madame Vil-&#xD;
larot tell you?"&#xD;
"No, she did not tell me. Why did you&#xD;
not come in to see me? It would have been&#xD;
only friendly to do so, and we were always&#xD;
good friends, w ere we not ?"&#xD;
" In America-yes. But in France there&#xD;
is no such thing as friendship between a man&#xD;
and a woman, unless they are brother and'&#xD;
sister, or ftancei, or old as-as Mount Horeb."&#xD;
Alan laughed. One can laugh even when&#xD;
one's heart is broken, you know-.&#xD;
"And if Madame Yillarot is such .a drag-&#xD;
oness-she does not look it. By-the-by, how&#xD;
do you come to be wandering about the Tuile-&#xD;
ries alone ? "&#xD;
She glanced up at him with a petulant mo-&#xD;
tion of her scarlet lip, which was very pretty&#xD;
and piquante.&#xD;
"Your gratitude, monsieur, is only equalled&#xD;
by your discernment. I came because Ma-&#xD;
dame Villarot has gone to drive, and because&#xD;
I wanted to see you-for old acquaintance'&#xD;
sake, perhaps-or because I thought you&#xD;
might like'to hear the news of Ermine from&#xD;
Ermine's Siamese Twin, as they called me in&#xD;
Charleston."&#xD;
" I see that I was not wrong when I used&#xD;
'to say that, notwithstanding all the keen&#xD;
thrusts of that sharp sword, your tongue, your&#xD;
heart was in the right place," said he, smiling&#xD;
kindly. " Thank you very much, dear Made-&#xD;
lon, for coming to see me, whether for old ac-&#xD;
quaintance' sake, or for that other, better&#xD;
reason. But " (looking a little puzzled),&#xD;
"how did you know that you should find me&#xD;
here ? "&#xD;
She smiled-the smile of one secure of her&#xD;
own discernment, and proud of her own skill-.&#xD;
" I was sure of it," said she. " Could any&#xD;
one-especially a stranger in Paris, with no.&#xD;
friends, and no places of familiar resort-pass&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
' I&#xD;
&#xD;
the open gates of the Tuileries without enter-&#xD;
ing ? C'est impossible!/ I felt confident you&#xD;
would be here, and so I caine. I saw 1dm"&#xD;
(motioning toward Nix) " before I saw you.&#xD;
Then I knew I had not been mistaken."&#xD;
" And," said Alan, drawing his hat a little&#xD;
,lower over his eyes, and setting his lips a little&#xD;
more firmly under the drooping mustache,&#xD;
e' and you come from Ermine ? Did she know&#xD;
that you were coming to me ?"&#xD;
Madelon shook her head, her bright, dark&#xD;
eyes meeting his as steadily as ever. -&#xD;
" No, I dared not tell her. It would have&#xD;
served no good purpose, but would only have&#xD;
unsettled her, and wakened the storm again.&#xD;
When things are at rest, they had bcttcr be&#xD;
left so," said she, with an~ expression, whiel-&#xD;
he did not exactly understand, flitting across&#xD;
her clear-cut, resolute lips. " Ermine's passion&#xD;
has expended itself-for the present at least-&#xD;
and where would be the sense of rousing it&#xD;
again, of overturning every thing and of mak-&#xD;
ing everybody miserable ? ,It would be worse&#xD;
than folly, worse than madness, and it shall&#xD;
not be done!/"&#xD;
"Did you come to tell me this ?" asked&#xD;
he, looking at her a little curiously, for he did&#xD;
not comprehend what interest of hers could&#xD;
have inspired the passionate energy which lent&#xD;
force to the last words.&#xD;
"Not entirely," answered she. "In fact,&#xD;
scarcely at all. I thought that Aunt H6lene&#xD;
might have been unnecessarily peremptory, in&#xD;
refusing to allow you to see Ermine, and that&#xD;
I would come and explain any thing which&#xD;
might need explanation."&#xD;
" You are very kind," said he, gratefully,&#xD;
"kinder than I deserve. Don't mind my&#xD;
brusquerie, Madelon. I never was much of a&#xD;
prevux chevalier, at the best of times, but this&#xD;
trouble has made me harsh and suspicious&#xD;
toward every one. Your aunt was gentle and&#xD;
considerate in the extreme, a woman among&#xD;
ten thousand," said he, smiling slightly, " for&#xD;
knowing how to govern the flux and reflux of&#xD;
a man's mood. I have promised her that I&#xD;
will not trouble Ermine again, and you may&#xD;
be sure that I shall keep my word." -&#xD;
." Did you ever fail to keep it ?" asked&#xD;
Madelon, her voice toned to sympathizing soft-&#xD;
ness, with just a thrill of admiration through&#xD;
it-a voice admirably calculated to sink into&#xD;
the depths of the confiding masculine soul.&#xD;
She scorned herself for the part she was play-&#xD;
ing, scorned herself with a scorn that fairly&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAMATIC- CAPABILITIES.               95&#xD;
&#xD;
tingled to the ends of her fingers; but, all the&#xD;
same, she took an artist's pride in doing well&#xD;
what she attempted to do at all. "I have&#xD;
known you a long time," went on the sweet&#xD;
woman-tones, seconded by the-lovely woman-&#xD;
eyes, "and I never knew you to break a prom-&#xD;
ise yet, Alan."&#xD;
" It is more than can be said of some other&#xD;
people, then," answered Alan, forgetting his&#xD;
gallantry, in a sudden remembrance of his&#xD;
wrongs. " Madelon, what promise did you&#xD;
give me-in Charleston last May ? And how&#xD;
have you kept it ?"&#xD;
"If you mean the promise to befriend Er-&#xD;
mine, " said Madelon, quietly, "I have done&#xD;
my best toward keeping it, from that day to&#xD;
the present."&#xD;
" And do you call it your 'best' to have&#xD;
let that scoundrel ofsa brother of mine in-&#xD;
veigle, force, or persuade her into a marriage ?&#xD;
-a marriage accursed, not blessed of God,&#xD;
since fraud was at the bottom of it !"&#xD;
" There you are mistaken," said Madelon,&#xD;
still quietly - as, leaning back, she held a&#xD;
dainty, lace-covered parasol to ward off' the&#xD;
sun, from which the leafless boughs above&#xD;
were but small protection-" there was no in-&#xD;
veigling nor forcing-nor persuading, I was&#xD;
about to say ; but I presume there was some&#xD;
of 'that-in the marriage, and certainly no&#xD;
fraud. Everybody clearly understood the&#xD;
terms of his or her bargain, for" (with a&#xD;
shrug) " there certainly was not much senti-&#xD;
ment in the affair. Raymond wanted money:&#xD;
Ermine wanted freedom to leave America.&#xD;
She furnished the first-he gave the last.&#xD;
'Voila tout!/"&#xD;
" But she was engaged to me !" said Alan,&#xD;
fiercely.&#xD;
"Engaged to you!" repeated Madelon,&#xD;
staring at him in honest astonishment. " Is&#xD;
the man mad ? Engaged to you ! Why, you&#xD;
were drowned !"&#xD;
" Was I? " (with a short, unmirthful&#xD;
laugh). "You see I have managed to come&#xD;
to life, nevertheless."&#xD;
" Well, we thought you were drowned-&#xD;
which comes to the same thing. It never oc-&#xD;
curred to us that you would overturn things&#xD;
by coming to life again-so nobody took the&#xD;
event into consideration."&#xD;
" Apparently not. It showed great want&#xD;
of foresight and consideration in you, Nix "&#xD;
(pulling the dog's long, silky ears again), " to&#xD;
drag me on that sand-bank when my strength&#xD;

&#xD;
had given way, and I was comfortably going&#xD;
to the bottom, unconscious of the good news&#xD;
in store for me. We made a hard fight to&#xD;
live) down there under the scorching, tropical&#xD;
sun, didn't we? How much better every thing&#xD;
would have been, old boy, if ~e had not made&#xD;
any fight at all, but had resigned our souls to&#xD;
God, and our bodies to the sharks, with what&#xD;
philosophy we could muster!"&#xD;
"Don't talk that way," said Madelon; "it&#xD;
is sinful, and it is foolish. Of course, it was&#xD;
your duty to try not to be drowned. But&#xD;
then, when you came to life and found that&#xD;
things were irrevocable, why could you not&#xD;
have kept quiet, like a sensible man? Why&#xD;
need you have come and tried to disturb and&#xD;
distract Ermine's mind when it could do no&#xD;
good?"&#xD;
"You follow the laudable example of the&#xD;
world," said he, gloomily. "Hit a man when&#xD;
he is dow~i- the harder the better, by all&#xD;
means! You ask me seky I did these things.&#xD;
Good IThavens! You might as well ask a&#xD;
mad dog why he turns and bites."&#xD;
"So, you have been mad? Well, I can&#xD;
believe it. But you are sane now, are you&#xD;
not?"&#xD;
"After a fashion-yes. At least I am&#xD;
sane enough to see that, since things are ir-&#xD;
revocable, I must endure, if I cannot accept&#xD;
them. But it is hard to go away without see-&#xD;
ing Ermine-without hearing from her own&#xD;
lips why she married that man; and why she&#xD;
could not have paid me the slight respect of&#xD;
waiting to learn whether I was really dead, or&#xD;
of giving me a few months' mourning if I&#xD;
were."&#xD;
"It is not necessary for you to see Ermine&#xD;
that those questions may be asked," said Ma-&#xD;
delon. "I can answer them as well as she.&#xD;
In the first place, you know how acutely sen-&#xD;
sitive she is, how intense both her sufferings&#xD;
and her enjoyments always are. You ought&#xD;
to be able to imagine, therefore, what a blow&#xD;
the news of your death was to her. You can&#xD;
fancy, perhaps, how it stunned every faculty&#xD;
of her mind, and seemed to wrap her in such&#xD;
a state of lethargy that she did not care what&#xD;
became of her. Her only active wish was, a&#xD;
desire not to return to Charleston-where, as&#xD;
she often said, she had been 'so happy.' She&#xD;
wanted to leave the country, but Aunt Vie-&#xD;
torine refused to accompany her, and she&#xD;
could not go alone. Just then, she learned&#xD;
that Mr. Erle's house was on 'the verge of&#xD;
&#xD;
bankruptcy. You know Ermine-you know&#xD;
her impulsive generosity. Can you not realize&#xD;
that, stunned us she was, hopeless for you,&#xD;
caring nothing for herself~ she should have&#xD;
been willing to sacrifice herself and her for-&#xD;
tune in the only possible way?"&#xD;
"But the news of my death was merely a&#xD;
rumor. She should not have acted so hastily&#xD;
-she might at least have waited to hear the&#xD;
truth."&#xD;
"And do you suppose that she did not&#xD;
take every means to learn the truth? Do you&#xD;
think she would ever have consented to the&#xD;
step of which I speak, unless she had been&#xD;
sure of your death? She clung desperately&#xD;
to hope, until she had summoned to her pres-&#xD;
ence, and drawn every particular from, a&#xD;
sailor-your own mate-who said that he had&#xD;
seen you perish. After that, how could she&#xD;
doubt?"&#xD;
"The infernal liar!" said Alan, between&#xD;
his set teeth, while one strong hand twisted&#xD;
itself in Nix's luxuriant mane, as if~ that had&#xD;
been the throat of the liar in question~.&#xD;
"Well, life is long, and I shall pay off that&#xD;
score some day-until then, the devil can af-&#xD;
ford to wait for his instrument. Good God!"&#xD;
-what a passionate cry it was which seemed&#xD;
wrung from his lips - "why is it that our&#xD;
lives, our loves, our ver~y souls, lie at the mercy&#xD;
of such villains as these?"&#xD;
Life is full of such questions; but from&#xD;
the blue sky above there comes no answer.&#xD;
Never yet has human despair, or human pre-&#xD;
sumption, wrung a solution of its perplexities&#xD;
from that dread yet glorious Presence, behind&#xD;
the veil of our mortality. In truth-&#xD;
"Our warfare Is In darkness. Friend for foe&#xD;
Blindly, and oft with swords exchanged, we strike:&#xD;
Opinion guesses: Faith alone can know&#xD;
Where actual and Illusive still are like."&#xD;
"Well," said Madelon, after a pause,&#xD;
you can see the rest for yourself. When&#xD;
Ermine heard of your arrival in. Charleston,&#xD;
and of your intention of coming to Martinique,&#xD;
she left the island at once-preferring to take&#xD;
a long ocean-voyage alone sooner than meet&#xD;
you. Judge, therefore, what she felt, when you&#xD;
presented yourself in Paris! Judge, if you&#xD;
are acting kindly or generously in thus making&#xD;
her hard lot infinitely harder to bear!"&#xD;
"Is that so?" said he, in a low voice.&#xD;
"Did she leave Martinique to avoid me? Poor&#xD;
child! To think that I-of all men-should&#xD;
become her persecutor!"&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
DRAMATIC CAPABILITIES.&#xD;
&#xD;
He uttered the last words to himself. Then,&#xD;
almost unconsciously, his face dropped into&#xD;
his hands and he sat silent for several minutes.&#xD;
Madelon would not disturb him. Unlike most&#xD;
women, she knew when to be silent-when to&#xD;
rest on her oars, conscious that the current&#xD;
was doing her work for her better than she&#xD;
could possibly do it for herself. She read&#xD;
Alan thoroughly, and she did not even need to&#xD;
ask "How goes the fight?" for she felt sure&#xD;
that it was going excellently well from her&#xD;
point of view, and that victory would soon&#xD;
perch on her banners. Meanwhile, two little&#xD;
birds were singing the most charming possi-&#xD;
ble duet on the lightly-swaying bough just&#xD;
over her lace-covered parasol; the music in&#xD;
the distance was thundering away at a grand&#xD;
march that made military visions dance&#xD;
through the most soberly civilian brain; the&#xD;
waters of the fountain rose and fell in their&#xD;
marble basin with a soft plash; every now and&#xD;
then loiterers strolled past, of whom one in&#xD;
ten, perhaps, admired the pretty picture made&#xD;
by the group-the lovely, freshly-dressed girl,&#xD;
the bronzed, handsome man, the magnificent&#xD;
dog lying at their feet, and the tender shadows&#xD;
flickering over them. There was quite an&#xD;
idyllic grace about the little scene. -Unluckily,&#xD;
it is not always that the poetry of reality and&#xD;
the poetry of appearance go together.&#xD;
After awhile Alan looked up-somewhat to&#xD;
Madelon's surprise, smiling a little.&#xD;
"How quiet you are!" he said. "Did&#xD;
you know that I was saying good-by to-to&#xD;
every thing, and were you silent out of re-&#xD;
spect? Well, it iS over-and you may be&#xD;
sure I don't mean to be melodramatic about&#xD;
it. I am not the first man who has lost the&#xD;
woman he loved-though I can't help thinking&#xD;
that mine is an aggravated case. lint, if Er-&#xD;
mine can only learn to be happy, I can. bear&#xD;
my own share of the robbery-for it is that.&#xD;
Madelon, do you think that she is-that she&#xD;
will be-happy?"&#xD;
"She has learned content, at least," an-&#xD;
swered Madelon. "In time-if you leave her&#xD;
alone-she may very reasonably learn happi-&#xD;
ness. I think she is on the road to it."&#xD;
Poor Alan! Loyal and -unselfish as he&#xD;
was, this was hard to hear, hard to receive as&#xD;
good news," while his own heart was still&#xD;
sore and sick and throbbing with great pain.&#xD;
"You arc not deceiving me, Madelon? "&#xD;
asked. "People sometimes think themselves&#xD;
privileged to do such things, 'for your own&#xD;
7&#xD;
&#xD;
good.' For my part, it- is saying very little to&#xD;
say that I should have no patience with such&#xD;
a pious fraud; I would never forgive it, or&#xD;
trust the author again~"&#xD;
- "Don't be so fierce," said Madelon, smil-&#xD;
ing. "I have committed no 'pious fraud.' I&#xD;
have told you the simple truth."&#xD;
"Honestly?" -&#xD;
"Honestly."&#xD;
"Then," said he, with a great effort," she&#xD;
shall have the opportunity to 'learn happiness'&#xD;
-if she can! God grant that she may! But&#xD;
it is not like the Ermine whom I have known&#xD;
all my life-the most faithful and gentle of&#xD;
women-to find even content such an easy&#xD;
lesson. I do not understand it, Madelon."&#xD;
"Why not?" asked Madden, with an un-&#xD;
easiness which she could not entirely conceal.&#xD;
"You made a goddess of Ermine, but in reality&#xD;
she is only a woman-neither better nor worse&#xD;
than most of us. Then you should remember&#xD;
that this blow, which is4resh with you, is old&#xD;
with her. But" (eagerly), "you must not&#xD;
misunderstand me-you must not think that&#xD;
she is not suffering acutely, suffering so much&#xD;
that I speak as her best friend when I beg you&#xD;
to go out of her life, and, if possible, not to&#xD;
let even your memory come back to torment&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"I will go," said he, sharply. "If possible,&#xD;
even my memory shall not come back to tor-&#xD;
ment her! I promised Madame Villarot that&#xD;
I would leave Paris to-night, and, as you re-&#xD;
marked a little while ago, I always try, at least,&#xD;
to keep my promises. I shall keep this one.&#xD;
I shall go to-night."&#xD;
"Where?" asked she, eagerly-a little too&#xD;
eagerly, as it chanced; but it is hard to be al-&#xD;
ways oft one's guard.&#xD;
He shrugged his shoulders.&#xD;
"Who can tell? Not I. To the devil,&#xD;
probably!. That is where people in my condi-&#xD;
tion mostly go."&#xD;
"Not to America ?" (again a little too ea-&#xD;
gerly).&#xD;
He looked at her keenly. As she had&#xD;
good cause to know of old, those sea-colored&#xD;
eyes could occasionally be very keen.&#xD;
"No," said he, slowly, "I scarcely think I&#xD;
shall go to America. Thanks for your inter-&#xD;
est. But why do you ask?"&#xD;
"Ermine will like to know, I amsure-for,&#xD;
if you remain in Europe, her life will be passed&#xD;
in a continual fever and dread of meeting&#xD;
you.                  -&#xD;

&#xD;
He laughed bitterly.&#xD;
"And so you think the Continent of Europe&#xD;
not wide enough to keep us apart? Why,&#xD;
are you not content, will she not be content, if&#xD;
'I covenant not to return to Paris?"&#xD;
"But she may leave it."&#xD;
"Tell me where she is likely to go, and I&#xD;
will avoid all such places."&#xD;
"It is hard to tell exactly," said Madden,&#xD;
drawing her straight, dark brows together.&#xD;
"We have relations in different parts of&#xD;
France, and then Aunt H~ltsne talks of Baden&#xD;
for the summer-of course, too, Ermine will&#xD;
go to Munich and Dresden, on account of art."&#xD;
"Then," with a smile which she did not&#xD;
altogether like, "I am fo~rnal1y excluded from&#xD;
France and Germany. Pray does Italy share&#xD;
in the prohibition?"&#xD;
"I don't know," said Madelon, rising and&#xD;
looking a little offended. "You seem to think&#xD;
that I have some interest to serve in the mat-&#xD;
ter. I only spoke for your own good and for&#xD;
Ermine's~ Of course it is a matter of indiffer-&#xD;
ence to me where you go."&#xD;
"Forgive me, Madelon," said he, rising&#xD;
too, and standing before her. "Don't let us&#xD;
part in vexation. That would be a poor return&#xD;
for your kindness in coming to meet me. I&#xD;
had no right to speak so rudely; but I meant&#xD;
ziothing-save that such things come hard on&#xD;
sne. I will do my best to keep clear of Er.&#xD;
mine's path-I promise you that. Now, must&#xD;
you go?"&#xD;
"Indeed I must," answered she, with a&#xD;
dismayed glance at her watch. ."Aunt H6-&#xD;
lone will be back, and what will she think of&#xD;
m&amp;amp;? No, no, Alan, you must not come with&#xD;
me-that would be adding double weight to&#xD;
the enormity of the misdemeanor. You must&#xD;
say good-by here, please "-putting out an ex-&#xD;
quisite little gray hand.&#xD;
~' I suppose you know best," said Alan, tak-&#xD;
ing it, regretfully, "but it seems hard lines that&#xD;
I cannot even walk with you to your own door.&#xD;
Think better of it, Mtsdelon, and let me make&#xD;
your excuses to Madame Villarot. We are&#xD;
such old friends!"&#xD;
" Good Heavens, no ! " cried Madelon,&#xD;
aghast at this proposal-as well, indeed, she&#xD;
might be, since the game which she was play-&#xD;
ing would have delighted Mr. Erle for its bold-&#xD;
ness !-~' she would never forgive me! And&#xD;
you, Alan-surely you would not return to the&#xD;
very house which holds Ermine."&#xD;
"This minute, if I thought only of myself,"&#xD;
&#xD;
answered Alan. "No-you needn't start. I&#xD;
try to think of her, and so it is not likely that&#xD;
I will do it. Confound that impertinent fel-&#xD;
low!" (glaring at a loiterer who had lifted his&#xD;
eye-glass in passing, and taken a scrutiny of&#xD;
the pair more keen than polite). "Are these&#xD;
French manners, Madden?"&#xD;
"They are manners of all over the world,&#xD;
I fancy," said Madelon, smiling, "when a gen-&#xD;
tleman continue$ to hold a lady's hand in the&#xD;
most affectionate manner on a public prome-&#xD;
nade. Say good-by, Alan-I really must go!"&#xD;
"Good-by, then," said. Alan, giving the&#xD;
hand in question a pressure which made it&#xD;
ache for a good ten minutes afterward. "God&#xD;
bless you, dear Madelon-and stand by her as&#xD;
a faithful friend!"&#xD;
"I will," said Madelon.&#xD;
And she absolutely meant it.&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
"MON CAMAB4DE!"&#xD;
"Lx micux est l'enncmi de bien," says a&#xD;
sensible French proverb-and a better exam-&#xD;
ple of its truth could not be given than that&#xD;
which the interview just concluded had af-&#xD;
forded. "Le micux" had certainly proved&#xD;
with Madelon, in marked degree, "l'enncmi de&#xD;
bien." Every thing which she desired had&#xD;
been effected for her by Madame Villarot, yet&#xD;
she distrusted so thoroughly the sincerity and&#xD;
stability of Alan's resolution that she was not&#xD;
content until she had endeavored to lend to&#xD;
this resolution added force. The result was,&#xD;
that she overshot her mark-as many a clever&#xD;
archer has done before.&#xD;
Having already spoken of the spell of good-&#xD;
ness and honor which seemed breathed like an&#xD;
aroma over Madame Villarot, it is almost un-&#xD;
necessary to sa~ that it was this alone which&#xD;
enabled her to conquer Alan's stubborn will,&#xD;
and to induce him to leave the woman he&#xD;
loved. But there was no such magnetism&#xD;
about Madelon. Fascination of a certain sort&#xD;
was hers, in I~ountWul measure; but it was the&#xD;
fascination which dazzles-not that which in-&#xD;
spires an abiding sense of trust. No one could&#xD;
ever say of her, "I believe in this woman be-&#xD;
cause goodness and purity are written on her&#xD;
face;" it was only possible to say, "I believe&#xD;
in this woman because she is of exceeding&#xD;
fairness because her voice is sweet, and her&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
eyes are eloquent." Now, this is a mode o&#xD;
reasoning with which ninety-nine men out of&#xD;
hundred are eminently satisfied, and, no doubi&#xD;
if Alan had been in love with the fair face, th&#xD;
sweet voice, and the eloquent eyes in question&#xD;
he would have found it satisfactory alse&#xD;
But, as it chanced, he had always distrust&#xD;
the beautiful creole; and never did this dis&#xD;
trust press so strongly upon him as after he ha(&#xD;
given that parting clasp to her daintily-glove&#xD;
hand, in the garden of the Tuileries.&#xD;
When she was gone, he sat down again oi&#xD;
the bench from which he had arisen, and ad&#xD;
dressed himself to the task of" thinking over'&#xD;
the interview just ended. The more he though&#xD;
it over, the stronger the feeling of distrust&#xD;
which at first had been purely unconscious, be&#xD;
came. Her s~ count of Ermine's marriage wa~&#xD;
plausible enod~h-that he acknowledged-.bui&#xD;
her eagerness to send him out of Paris, hei&#xD;
desire to keet( him far from Ermine's possibh&#xD;
path of life, struck him as suspicious. It was&#xD;
true this might have been accounted for on thc&#xD;
score of unselfish affection toward her cousin&#xD;
-but no one who knew Madelon could possi-&#xD;
bly have affirmed that unselfish affection was&#xD;
her strong point. Self had always subordi-&#xD;
nated every other consideration with her, de-&#xD;
spite a certain fitful attachment to a few per-&#xD;
sons, a certain fitful power of making now&#xD;
and then a sacrifice-provided always that&#xD;
there was some element of grandeur about it.&#xD;
With the glamour of her eyes and smile with-&#xD;
drawn, her words, which still lingered in Alan's&#xD;
memory, seemed to have the ring of false coin&#xD;
-coin which, instead of being sterling gold, is&#xD;
base metal-and, try as he would, he could&#xD;
not baniak this impression. When he left&#xD;
Madame Villarot, notwithstanding all his Nt-&#xD;
ter pain and sadness, he had felt secure, secure&#xD;
that truth, and truth only, had been spoken to&#xD;
him, secure that, with that gentle lady, Ermine&#xD;
would at least be free from annoyance or pain.&#xD;
He was ready to leave Paris then, ready to go&#xD;
back to America and covenant never again to&#xD;
look upon the sweet face of the woman he&#xD;
loved. But all this was changed when Made-&#xD;
len's ill-omened beauty and fascination crossed&#xD;
his path. He distrusted her-he said that&#xD;
again and again to himself-swearing, too, a&#xD;
deep oath that she would not compass her&#xD;
end, whatever that end might be. "She is&#xD;
Raymond's tool, no doubt," said he, bitterly-&#xD;
"paid, very likely, to keep me from seeing&#xD;
Ermine! Wellwhat I have promised, I will&#xD;
&#xD;
C do-the more readily since Ermine herself is&#xD;
a anxious to avoid me. Madame Villarot's word&#xD;
~, is good for that. I shall leave Paris to-night.-.-&#xD;
e but I shall not leave the Continent of Europe.&#xD;
, My health is suffering from the hardships of&#xD;
my shipwreck, and a little travel will do me&#xD;
I good. We need to shake off morbid feelings&#xD;
and thoughts, don't we, Nix? We wilt shake&#xD;
I them off, too, old boy! We'll climb Mont&#xD;
I Blanc, and sail on Lake Leman, and go to see&#xD;
your canim~ brethren at the Hospice of St.&#xD;
~ Bernard. Mademoiselle Lautrec is very clever,&#xD;
- but w~h all her cleverness she has not disposed&#xD;
of us ~t-and by the Heaven above, old dog,&#xD;
she never shall!"&#xD;
From which it will be seen that Mademoi-&#xD;
* selle Lautrec had certainly overre~tched herself&#xD;
in no slight degree. ,After all, it is a fortu-&#xD;
nate thing that the good old times of poisoned&#xD;
roses and gloves are over-else Captain Erle's&#xD;
days might have come rather ab\uptly to an&#xD;
end, if Madelon had chanced to overhear or&#xD;
suspect the resolution with which his soliloquy&#xD;
* had closed.&#xD;
*    Madelon, however, had gone home con-&#xD;
* gratulating herself on the successful issue of&#xD;
her bold experiment , had looked approvingly&#xD;
at her fair face in the mirror draped with&#xD;
p~le-blue hangings, had laid aside her prome-&#xD;
nade costume for a gold-colored silk with a&#xD;
golden rose in her dark hair, had clasped on&#xD;
her statuesque arms and neck the jewels for&#xD;
which she had signed away her honor, had&#xD;
finally gone forth to astonish Madame Villarot&#xD;
by "her wonderful fortitude," and to win the&#xD;
admiration and flattery which had become as&#xD;
necessary to her existence as the air she&#xD;
breathed. She was so exultant over the bright&#xD;
prospect opening before her, that it required&#xD;
all her well-trained dramatic power to preserve&#xD;
even a semblance of pensive sadness. She&#xD;
would have liked to laugh, to sing, even to&#xD;
dance along the polished floor, bidding life come&#xD;
and be enjoyed. Did she feel no remorse over&#xD;
her accomplished work? She would have&#xD;
laughed in your face if you had suggested&#xD;
such a thing, and told you that she was not&#xD;
"sentimental."&#xD;
These things were her rights-.-this wealth,&#xD;
and enjoyment, and happiness-and Alan was&#xD;
the robber who had come to wrest them from&#xD;
her. Why should she not be~glad, then, that&#xD;
she had so successfully met obstinate strength&#xD;
with subtle strategy, and done the best, not&#xD;
only for herself; but for everybody else?&#xD;

&#xD;
"Belle it faire peur!" said she, making a&#xD;
sweeping courtesy before one of the grand&#xD;
mirrors of the saloon, as the soft wax-lights&#xD;
- flashed, back from her diamonds. "Now, at&#xD;
last, I am happy !-now, at last, I live the life&#xD;
for which I was born! If that horrible man&#xD;
would only go and be drowned in earnest, my&#xD;
cup of felicity would be full to the brim!"&#xD;
The horrible man, thus devoted to watery&#xD;
destruction, had, several hours before ~this&#xD;
time, left his pleasant seat in the garden of the&#xD;
Tuileries, and strolled away into the busy&#xD;
city-the city so wonderful that one might&#xD;
think it enchanted if one did not know that&#xD;
here, as well as elsewhere, tears are shed,&#xD;
pangs suffered, and death-gasps given. But~&#xD;
these things seem far away out of sight. To&#xD;
the stranger there is nothing to suggest such&#xD;
awful, and, alast such common extremes and&#xD;
possibilities of human anguish. It is her&#xD;
brightest face which the fair city shows on the&#xD;
Rue do Rivoli, the Faubourg St.-Honor6, the&#xD;
Palais Royal, the Champs Elyades, and the&#xD;
beautiful Bois with the glory of sunset re-&#xD;
flected in its magical lakes. The very atmos-&#xD;
phere seems golden' with the glamour of fan-&#xD;
cy and the poetry of romance! In Notre-&#xD;
Dame the air is full of faint fragrance, like a&#xD;
dream of incense, while a stream of light, fall-&#xD;
ing athwart the marble pavement, pales with&#xD;
its glory the steady lustre of the sanctuary&#xD;
lamp suspended in front of that majestic altar&#xD;
on which the hands of martyred prelates have&#xD;
offered the consecrated Host. Under the&#xD;
grahd old arches that have echoed the divine&#xD;
eloquence of Lacordaire, shadowy forms pass&#xD;
to and fro; here and there, at the difibrent&#xD;
chapels, candles flicker in the redllow gloom;&#xD;
every thing is full of harmony, every thing is&#xD;
wrapped in tranquil silence and holy repose.&#xD;
Little as Alan could boast of any thing&#xD;
save that natural reverence which it speaks&#xD;
ill for any man to forget, the gay sunshine and&#xD;
the jostlln~ crowd jarred on him, as he came&#xD;
out from the dim, religious hush of the great&#xD;
cathedral, and bent his restless steps toward&#xD;
the Louvre. If he was not an artist, at least&#xD;
he had artistic appreciation in no common de.&#xD;
gree; so it was no wonder that the remaining&#xD;
hours of the afternoon were all spent among&#xD;
the marvellous paintings and statuca gathered&#xD;
in those great, golden halls. It was worth&#xD;
while to roam and loiter there at will,,and after&#xD;
a time to watch the close of the radiant 'day&#xD;
from the tall windows, to see the sunset tints&#xD;
&#xD;
streaking the tender sky, the evening vesper&#xD;
of light and perfume ascending, the wonderful&#xD;
glory spreading over the heavens and resting&#xD;
like a benediction on the churches and palaces,&#xD;
the flashing river and stately columns, the an-&#xD;
cient quarters and new boulevards of "the&#xD;
town of Clovis, of Clotilde, of Genevieve, the&#xD;
town of Charlemagne, of Saint-Louis, of Philip&#xD;
Augustus, and of Henry IV., the capital of the&#xD;
sciences, the arts, and of civilization.""&#xD;
So absorbed in the beauty without as to be&#xD;
forgetful even of the beauty within, Alan scarce-&#xD;
ly noticed how the galleries were thinning, how&#xD;
the well-dressed loungers and the busy artists&#xD;
were alike departing, but strn stood with folded&#xD;
arms gazing on the matchless scene outspread&#xD;
before him, when a hand was suddenly laid on&#xD;
his shoulder, and, turning, he faced that which&#xD;
he least expected, and perhaps desired-an ac-&#xD;
quairitance.&#xD;
"Thi~ is Alan ErIe, I am sure," said a&#xD;
slender, dark-eyed young man. "I have been&#xD;
watching you for 4 least ten minutes, but you&#xD;
would not turn roundand sol was obliged to&#xD;
claim your notice in this way. Have you for-&#xD;
gotten me-Stuart Lamar, of Georgia? I&#xD;
went to school with you, if you remember."&#xD;
"I remember perfectly," said Alan, frank-&#xD;
ly shaking the extended hand. "In fact, we&#xD;
have met since then, I think. Didn't I dine&#xD;
at your father's house in Savannah, two years&#xD;
ago?"&#xD;
"Certainly you did!" responded the other,&#xD;
smiling; "a didn't you return the compli-&#xD;
ment when I went over to Charleston, by in-&#xD;
troducing me to three of the prettiest girls I&#xD;
ever saw ?-Have you been long in Paris?"&#xD;
"Long enough to be tired of it. And&#xD;
"Well, I am fresh at sight-seeing - I&#xD;
haven't been here more than a fortnight, so I&#xD;
have not begun to be tired yet. The greatest&#xD;
drawback to my enjoyment has been an inca-&#xD;
pacity to understand or be understood. I&#xD;
thought I was a pretty fair French scholar,&#xD;
but the confounded people will talk s~ fast.&#xD;
Don't you find that ratherpuzzling?"&#xD;
"I am a sailor, you know, and used to&#xD;
speaking many tongues of many lands. I un-&#xD;
derstand, and manage to make myself under-&#xD;
stood-after a fashion, at least."&#xD;
"It is very refreshing to meet you," said&#xD;
* Letter of the Count de Chiunbordon theboinbard-&#xD;
ment of Paris.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"MON CAJ&#xD;
&#xD;
Lamar, with evident sincerity. "After a man&#xD;
has been roaming about in a foreign land, he&#xD;
appreciates a familiar face."&#xD;
"And a familiar tongue,~~ said Alan; "that's&#xD;
better yet, isn't it? see! unless we mean&#xD;
to spend the night among the pictures and&#xD;
statues, we'd better be moving. This place will&#xD;
soon be shut up. Are you with a party?"&#xD;
The other made a comical gesture with his&#xD;
shoulders and eyebrows.&#xD;
"No such good luck! Several of us start-&#xD;
ed from home together, but, somehow, no two&#xD;
had the same idea about the tour, and we had&#xD;
scarcely landed before we separated. As for&#xD;
me, I came to Paris, and devilish heavy work&#xD;
i've found it all alone! My principal amuse-&#xD;
ment has been to walk about the streets, listen&#xD;
to the bapds-does it strike you that a band&#xD;
always is playing somewhere ?-look in at the&#xD;
ixtfis, end say with Hood:&#xD;
"'When yo~ go to France,&#xD;
- Be sure y~,u know the lingo,&#xD;
For, If you don't, like me,&#xD;
You will repent, by jingo!'&#xD;
Let me return your question, by-the-by, and&#xD;
ask if ~1'ou are with a party?"&#xD;
"No such bad luck!" answered Alan,&#xD;
shrugging his shoulders, as they went down-&#xD;
stairs, "Where are you staying?" he went&#xD;
on. "I sin leaving Paris to-night, but still-"'&#xD;
He stopped in his speech, amused by the&#xD;
dismay which came over Lamar's face.&#xD;
"'Leaving to-night!" he repeated. "Good&#xD;
heavens! what4o you mean by that? Why,&#xD;
Paris is glorious just now-and I have been&#xD;
thiniring what a splendid time I should have,&#xD;
with you to do the talking for' me. We would&#xD;
~go to Versailles, and Fontainebleau, and St..&#xD;
Cloud, and-and the opera every night. I&#xD;
like that better than the theatre, because I&#xD;
can understand the music. My dear fellow,&#xD;
pray think better of it! Consider-"&#xD;
"The lilies of the field?" asked Alan,&#xD;
laughing. "It is rather early for them,' my&#xD;
dear boy-at least just here. Perhaps I shall&#xD;
find them in their glory when I reach Italy&#xD;
next week."&#xD;
"Italy!" repeated the other, still petulant.&#xD;
"What the devil are you going to Italy for?&#xD;
Do you expect to meet anybody there?"&#xD;
"One never knows who may turn up in&#xD;
the way of friends and acquaintances-vide&#xD;
our pleasant encounter-but I have no such&#xD;
definite cxpectatioh."&#xD;
"Then why on earth do you go? Excuse&#xD;
&#xD;
tIARADE!"                            iQi&#xD;
itie! I'm afraid I'm awfully rude, but it is really&#xD;
enough to try a man's patience! Stay, Erle-do&#xD;
stay! I'll wager any thing you won't regret it.&#xD;
You can't have seen every thing in Paris, you&#xD;
know-or, if you have, it will all bear being -&#xD;
seen over again."&#xD;
"My dear fellow-"&#xD;
"Oh, deuce take it !-thnt tone tells the&#xD;
tale. 'My dear fellow, I am sorry to be dis-&#xD;
obliging, but must really, etc.,' etc.' 'Pon my&#xD;
honor, it is too bad! It is like the dear ga-&#xD;
zelle, when one finds a friend, only to lose him.&#xD;
Look here, Erle !-will you be honest and say&#xD;
'No,' if what I am about to propose does not&#xD;
suit you?"&#xD;
"Without the least hesitation," answered&#xD;
Alan, truthfully enough.&#xD;
"Then tell me frankly if you are anxious&#xD;
to go to Italy alone, or if you would like a&#xD;
companion?"&#xD;
"Yourself?"&#xD;
"Myself; of course. Now, don't say 'Yes,'&#xD;
unless you mean it."&#xD;
"Let me think a minute," said Alan&#xD;
So, as they walked along in the dusk, he&#xD;
considered the proposal. He knew very little&#xD;
of Lamar; but that little assured him'that the&#xD;
young Georgian was a thoroughly good fellow,&#xD;
a genial, frank gentleman, and the person of&#xD;
all others to cast the sunshine of bright spirits&#xD;
over a journey by land or sea. If Alan wanted&#xD;
a companion at all, certainly he might go far-&#xD;
ther and fare worse than with the one who was&#xD;
ready to his hand just here. But die! he want&#xD;
a companion? That was the rub, and, if he&#xD;
had answered the question according to his&#xD;
first impulse, he would certainly have uttered&#xD;
a negative. But Lamar's fresh, cager face&#xD;
and the accents of the home-voice had uncon-&#xD;
sciously attracted him. After all, he was set-&#xD;
ting forth to shake off morbid thoughts, not to&#xD;
nurse them, and, if he travelled alone, was there&#xD;
much hope of his doing the former, or his ezot&#xD;
doing the latter? Would notsucha companion&#xD;
as this be really worth more than any amount&#xD;
of Qther remedies? As he hesitated-and ah!&#xD;
would he have hesitated at all, if he had only&#xD;
known how much hinged on this decision!&#xD;
-one fair, pure star quivered into sight above&#xD;
the, house - tops, and his decision was sud-&#xD;
lenly taken.&#xD;
"Lamer," said he, "don't misunderstand&#xD;
ny silence. I shall be sincerely glad if you&#xD;
z411 go with me to Italy. I meant to go to&#xD;
switzerland, but it is too cold for that just yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
p&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC8067-00000052"/>&#xD;
But I must start to-night. That is imperative.&#xD;
Would you care to make such a sudden&#xD;
move?"&#xD;
"I sha'n't break many hearts by my depart-&#xD;
ure," answered Lamar, with one of his boyish&#xD;
grimaces, "and my traps are few. I don't see&#xD;
why I can't start to-night, therefore. If you'll&#xD;
tabe me, I think I'll got I feel like a man&#xD;
who, having bees~ shipwrecked, suddenly meets&#xD;
-Hallo! What the deuce-.--why, man alive,&#xD;
I have just remembered that the last I heard&#xD;
of you, you were drowned! How, in the name&#xD;
Neptune, did you come to life again?"&#xD;
"Under a galvanic battery," responded&#xD;
Alan, grimly. "Nature's patent, not likely to&#xD;
be stolen by art-only, as a friend, I wouldn't&#xD;
advise you to try its effect. A sand-bank in&#xD;
the tropics isn't the best possible place foray&#xD;
constitution short of a salamander's. It is in&#xD;
consequence of this that I am going to recruit&#xD;
mine in Italy."&#xD;
"I thought you looked badly," said Lamar,&#xD;
simply, "but, like a fool, I did not think of&#xD;
the cause. Really, I am ashamed of myself!"&#xD;
"Don't be, my good fellow! There isn't&#xD;
the least need of such a sentiment."&#xD;
"But I ought to have remembered! I&#xD;
recollect well how shocked I was when I read&#xD;
the announcement of your death. But, some-&#xD;
how, the whole thing went out of my head&#xD;
when I saw yourfamiliar shoulders this even-&#xD;
ing. I said to myself, 'There isn't such&#xD;
another pair in the world,' so up I marched,&#xD;
without thinking for a moment that the shoul-&#xD;
ders in question might be ghostly' nothings.&#xD;
But I forgot-.wheredid you say-you were stay-&#xD;
ing? I'm at the H6tel du Lotivre, near by."&#xD;
"And I at the H&amp;amp;tel du Ithin. Will you&#xD;
come with me? I left my dog there, and, un-&#xD;
less I go to him, he will enliven the establish-&#xD;
ment by such a series of howls that the police&#xD;
will very likely have to be called in. That is&#xD;
a Parisian's remedy for every ill, you know.&#xD;
Come, and you shell order the menu yourself.&#xD;
We don't leave till 11.50, so that will you&#xD;
time enough to leek after your tr .'&#xD;
"All right," said Lamar, receiving any and&#xD;
every proposal with the utmost amiability, pro-&#xD;
vided he was not called upon to relinquish&#xD;
sight of his new-found comrade.&#xD;
having refreshed the inner man, the two&#xD;
friends found that their "traps" required&#xD;
very little arrangement, and that, after this&#xD;
duty had been dispatched, a wheW evening&#xD;
&#xD;
yet hung heavily on their hands. Lamar&#xD;
yawned so piteously, that, compassionating his&#xD;
ennui, Alan carried him off to the Com~die&#xD;
Fran~aise, where they saw a sparkling comedy&#xD;
charmingly acted, then they strolled back to&#xD;
their hotel through the illuminated streets,&#xD;
and, as Madelon was taking the golden rose&#xD;
from out her hair and the brilliant ornaments&#xD;
from off her arms, they dashed away into the&#xD;
night, with the head of their fiery horse turned&#xD;
straight toward the fair South.&#xD;
CHAI'TER IX.&#xD;
"ONE FACE!"&#xD;
UNDER the blue, rarely blue sky of Italy, the&#xD;
Lago di Como lies like a sheet of lapis-lazuhi&#xD;
in the noontide sun. There is scarcely breeze&#xD;
enough to ripple the glassy surface of the&#xD;
water, or steal through the closed jealousies of&#xD;
the palaces and villas which gem its winding&#xD;
shores, while in the shade of their deep arched&#xD;
entrances, or beside the marble steps, against&#xD;
which the azure waters softly plash,,hie the&#xD;
brightly-cushioned pleasure-boats, motionlesss&#xD;
and unoccupied. The rustle of a leaf is scarce-&#xD;
ly heard on the steep mountain-sides, which,&#xD;
girt by the olive and fig, the laurel and cactus,&#xD;
tower above the placid lake, flanked by the&#xD;
grand, snow-clad peaks of the higher Alps.&#xD;
In the fairy hanging-gardens, and on the ter-&#xD;
races studded with baskets of orange, olean-&#xD;
der, and myrtle, every sound is mute. The&#xD;
embowered convents and the picturesque vil-&#xD;
lags with their tapering spires lie wrapped in&#xD;
such absolute repose that it is almost possible to&#xD;
imagine that an enchanter's wand has hovered&#xD;
over the fair scene and bound it with a spell.&#xD;
Even the swarthy, sunburnt fishermen have&#xD;
fallen asleep in their boats, secure in the grale-&#xD;
ful shadow of some olive-shaded, land-locked&#xD;
bay. In truth, a potent enchanter has been&#xD;
at work-that high-noon of the South, whose&#xD;
imperative ardor proclaims an armistice of&#xD;
labor. Spring has melted into summer, and&#xD;
even on the Lago di Como the scorching heat&#xD;
of the latter season holds triumphant sway.&#xD;
Scorching it is; for not one breath of the&#xD;
welcome north breeze has come down from the&#xD;
Alpine hills, to stir the drooping leaves of the&#xD;
foliage, or ruffle the mirror-like surface of the&#xD;
lake. On the terrace of a villa near the beau-&#xD;
tiful promontory of Bellagio, two ladies are&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
102  BBTDE." ONE FACE !"                                                                                         10&#xD;
&#xD;
seated under an awning, both of them waiting&#xD;
eagerly for the first breath of this breeze, and&#xD;
one of them now and then leaning over to fan&#xD;
the other. A shry strong, pleasant face the&#xD;
latter has, a face surrounded by bands of iron-&#xD;
gray hair, and brightened by keen, intelligent&#xD;
brown eyes. These eyes are a little sad and&#xD;
very tender as they rest on her companion, a&#xD;
pale, slend ,dark-eyed girl, who seems wasted&#xD;
away to a ~h adow; whose fragile hands as they&#xD;
lie in her lap look almost transparent; and&#xD;
whose feet are plainly standing on the verge&#xD;
of that unknown sea which mortals call im-&#xD;
mortality. After a while, she looks up at her&#xD;
companion with a sweet smile, speaking Eng-&#xD;
lish with a soft, Southern accent.&#xD;
"Thanks, dear Miss North, you are so&#xD;
kind. ~3ut please don't tire yourself; it is al-&#xD;
ways tiresome to fan anybody."&#xD;
"Not to me," answered the elder lady.&#xD;
"But, if it worries you, I can call Lucia. She&#xD;
does it well, and never tires."&#xD;
"No, no, let poor Lucia sleep. You know&#xD;
she was awake all night. My cough is so&#xD;
annoying at night, and then the fever makes&#xD;
me restless. I am afraid" (with a short sigh)&#xD;
"that I am very impatient, and give a great&#xD;
deal of unnecessary trouble"&#xD;
"You impatient! My darling, how can&#xD;
you say such a thing? Only the other morn-&#xD;
ing I found Lucia crying, and I asked her&#xD;
what was the matter. 'The signorina is too&#xD;
good,' she said, shaking her head and sobbing&#xD;
She is ready for paradise.' So you see"&#xD;
(with a faint smile) "she does not find you&#xD;
very troublesome."&#xD;
"That is because she is so faithful and de-&#xD;
voted. Ah, how fortunate I have been to find&#xD;
such a friend as you, and such a servant as&#xD;
Lucia, in my hour of need! Dear Miss North,&#xD;
I wonder if you will thoroughly realize, when&#xD;
you go back to your own life and your own&#xD;
friends, what gratitude and love the girl for&#xD;
whom you have sacrificed so much felt for&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
"I have sacrificed nothing," said Miss&#xD;
North, hastily. "Ermine, my child, don't you&#xD;
know that you have grown nearer to my heart&#xD;
than anybody else in the woi'ld, nearer by far&#xD;
than my own kindred? Is it a sacrifice to&#xD;
live in these beautiful lands with you, and try&#xD;
to take care of you? My bonnie darling, stay&#xD;
with me! ~!hat isalliaak."&#xD;
"But that Is not forane to ~raat," said Br-&#xD;
mine, putting out her frail, buming hand-&#xD;
&#xD;
burning with the fever which had sapped the&#xD;
foundation of life. "Dear friend, kind friend&#xD;
-the kindest, save one, that I have ever&#xD;
known-I am not sure that I would grant it&#xD;
jf, I could! Life is very sweet to those who&#xD;
are rich in its gifts and goods-but what have&#xD;
I ?"&#xD;
"You have youth, beauty, great talent, and&#xD;
many possibilities of happiness.~~&#xD;
"When health is gone, youth is gone,~~&#xD;
said Ermine, sadly, "and beauty too. With&#xD;
my talent-such as it is-I have done what I&#xD;
could, and, if God spared my life, I should hope&#xD;
to do more. But He knows best. As for the&#xD;
possibilities of happiness-well, Art is fair,&#xD;
and Nature is fairer. But are not these only&#xD;
types of that Beauty on which the eyes of the&#xD;
spirit shall open? We think that nothing&#xD;
could be more exquisite than this lovely lake;&#xD;
but surely the hand which gave this to the&#xD;
material senses can give something better yet&#xD;
to those which are immortal?"&#xD;
"My child, who doubts it?"&#xD;
"Ab, then" (with passionately- clasped&#xD;
hands), "why wish to stay? If love is sweet,&#xD;
think what it must be to love Love itself! *&#xD;
If beauty is fair, think what it must be to see&#xD;
Beauty such as 'it hath ~eot entered into the&#xD;
heart of man to conceive!' Now, those have&#xD;
been my two passions-..-love of love, and love&#xD;
of beauty. t~od made them both. It can-&#xD;
not be wrong, then, to climb by them to&#xD;
"Wrong!~' Miss North could say no more,&#xD;
for tears rose up and choked her.&#xD;
"Am I paining you?" asked Ermine, gem.&#xD;
tly. "Ak, dear Miss North, don't shut your&#xD;
eyes to the truth. I talk of these things be-&#xD;
cause I am very near them-so near that fear&#xD;
seems to have left me, and I feel the trust of a&#xD;
little child who is led by its mother's hand into&#xD;
the dark."&#xD;
"Ermine," said Miss North, suddenlydrop-&#xD;
ping her fan, and seizing the girl's delicate&#xD;
hands, "tell me-in the midst of your grief, did&#xD;
you ever pray for death?"&#xD;
"Never," answered Ermine, simply. "How&#xD;
could you think such a thing? I have never&#xD;
been so wicked as that. But, somehow, the&#xD;
l*rden of life seemed too heavy for me when&#xD;
my boy went out of it. Y~u know it was not&#xD;
as if he had been any ordinary friend or ordi-&#xD;

&#xD;
nary lover-but he had been the stay and idol&#xD;
of my life. I hope I was not sinful in my&#xD;
grief-I tried not to be. But existence looked&#xD;
so blank-so dreary. I thought to myself,&#xD;
'How shall I bear this desolation through the&#xD;
long years of a lifetime?' Of course, people&#xD;
told me I would forget it; but I knew better&#xD;
-I knew that I never forgot anything. I was&#xD;
a little child when my father died, but I shed&#xD;
tears for him now as bitter as those which I&#xD;
shed then. Iknew that, if I lived to be seven-&#xD;
ty, I should still mourn for Alan. And God&#xD;
knew it. So He called me from the burden&#xD;
and heat of the day, and I-how can I be sor-&#xD;
ry 1' If I lived longer, I might commit some&#xD;
sin which would shut me out from heaven for-&#xD;
ever. Now I have not much to reproach my-&#xD;
self with-except being too little resigned when&#xD;
love and happiness went from me-last Oc-&#xD;
tober."&#xD;
"Child," said the elder woman, sorrowfully,&#xD;
"I never knew before what a good thing in-&#xD;
constancy is."&#xD;
"Is it?," said Ermine, smiling-a shadowy&#xD;
but ineffably sweet smile. "Ah, no! Blessed&#xD;
be God for memory! If every bright gift of&#xD;
earth were offered to me in exchange for the&#xD;
recollection of my darling, do you thing I&#xD;
would take them I' Do you think I would buy&#xD;
health, and beauty, and happiness, at such a&#xD;
price? Do you think I could even resign my-&#xD;
self to death if I did not know that the recol-&#xD;
leetion wrn go with me into life? Perhaps I&#xD;
think of it too much" (with a wistful, pathetic&#xD;
look), "but I cannot help it. The saints loved&#xD;
God purely in and for Himself, but u's must go&#xD;
to Him through our' earthly passions. I am&#xD;
sure our dear Lord will not be hard upon me&#xD;
for being too faithful to my poor human love.&#xD;
But see !-here comes the breeze!"&#xD;
She turned her pale face toward it as she&#xD;
spoke-klrinking in its cool refreshment eager-&#xD;
ly. As her gaze wandered toward the distant&#xD;
snow-clad heights from which it came, Miss&#xD;
North'p eyes dwelt on her. Ab, what ravages&#xD;
the last few months-nay, even the last few&#xD;
weeks, had made! Over the pale face and the&#xD;
fragile form, the very shadow of Azrai~l seemed&#xD;
to hover. Life, deprived of its onlylight, had&#xD;
indeed proved too much for the great, passi4wi-&#xD;
ate heart, the gentle, faithful nature. Some&#xD;
people have one gift, sonic another; few are&#xD;
so poor as to be without any. Ermine's was&#xD;
the gift of constancy. Alan ErIe might have&#xD;
been dead to all the rest of the world, but to&#xD;
&#xD;
the tender heart which, winni~ig once he had&#xD;
won forever, he still lived, and still-&#xD;
"One Sice, remembering his, forgot i'o smile."&#xD;
The wasted lines of that face spoke so elo-&#xD;
quently to Miss North's heart, that many salt&#xD;
tears dropped in her lap before she could find&#xD;
voice to speak. Then she said, gently:&#xD;
"Ermine, darling, don't you think you&#xD;
might be better if you tried to cross the Alps?&#xD;
It seems to me that this climate may account&#xD;
for your extreme debility."&#xD;
"I cross the Alps!" said Ermine. "I&#xD;
could not even cross that promontory yonder!&#xD;
Dear, kind friend, why won't you see the&#xD;
truth? I would rather you did, because there&#xD;
is no telling how soon the realization may be&#xD;
brought home to you. If I needed any con-&#xD;
firmation of my own knowledge, I should have&#xD;
found it in the doctor's face when he saw me&#xD;
this morning-and in P~re Aubr~'s" (this was&#xD;
a French priest who chanced to be staying at&#xD;
Varenna), "when he left me a little while ago.&#xD;
No, the end is very near, and I think I may&#xD;
say I am ready for it. If it came to-night-as&#xD;
it may do-I can go, having left no duty&#xD;
knowingly unfulfilled. I have written to mam-&#xD;
ma and to Madelon. You will find the letters&#xD;
in my desk. Then I left some instructions-a&#xD;
will, I suppose it might be called-concerning&#xD;
the little property which I retained. Some of&#xD;
it goes as a marriage-portion to Lucia; the&#xD;
rest I have left to charity. For you, my kind&#xD;
and only friend, I have but my love, my grati-&#xD;
tude, my prayers, and every thing personal to&#xD;
myself which you may desire to keep. What&#xD;
you. do not keep, give to Lucili. No one else&#xD;
will care for them. I did not leave you any&#xD;
money" (smiling a little), "because I know&#xD;
that, with the property left by your brother,&#xD;
you are able to provide for all your wants, and&#xD;
it would have seemed like-like paying you&#xD;
for all you have done!"&#xD;
"I am glad you did not," said Miss North,&#xD;
between her tears. "Love's service can only&#xD;
be paid with love."&#xD;
"I know it," said Ermine, softly.&#xD;
After this there was silence again. Lightly&#xD;
the breeze came over the water, rippling it&#xD;
into a myriad tiny waves which broke with&#xD;
soft, musical plash against the flight of steps&#xD;
reaching from the terrace, not to the water's&#xD;
edge, but to the very water itself. The eyes&#xD;
of the dying girl gazed wistfully on the fairy&#xD;
beauty and brilliance of the scene-the azure&#xD;
&#xD;
5&#xD;
&#xD;
105&#xD;
&#xD;
lake, the lofty mountains, covered with almost&#xD;
tropical verdure, the gleaming palaces, temples,&#xD;
and villas, the nimbus of golden sunlight over&#xD;
the distant Alpine peaks, the fish darting to&#xD;
and fro in the pellucid water. Happy fish, to&#xD;
live in the waters of Como, we are almost&#xD;
tempted to think. But no doubt even fish&#xD;
have their troubles-especially when they are&#xD;
caught. As Ermine gazed in silence on this&#xD;
wealth of magical beauty, a small boat, which&#xD;
had been lying in a shadowy cove near the&#xD;
proniontory, pushed out from the shore, and,&#xD;
propelled by lazy but evidently practiced&#xD;
strokes, began to move over the water, leaving&#xD;
a track of glorified sunlight behind. It had an&#xD;
awning, and, as well as could be seen, con-&#xD;
tained only one occupant, though, as a matter&#xD;
of fact,1another recumbent figure lay in the&#xD;
bottom, while a large dog crouched motionless&#xD;
at the stern. Though the little craft was far&#xD;
from being one of the gay barciolinas which&#xD;
tourists and sight-seers patronize, it made a&#xD;
pretty adjunct to the scene, and Ermine&#xD;
watched its course with that interest which&#xD;
trifles sometimes waken in the sick.&#xD;
Near and mo,~cai~ itcame, until at last&#xD;
it glided in front -the villa only a few feet&#xD;
distant from the terrace on which the ladies sat.&#xD;
The oarsman-a young, handsome man, wear-&#xD;
ing a broad-brimmed straw hat-suffered it to&#xD;
float slowly by, as he caught sight of the two&#xD;
figures under the orange-trees. Sickness had&#xD;
not robbed Ermine of all her beauty. 11cr&#xD;
eyes still remained-larger, darker, softer than&#xD;
ever-and the outlines of her face were all&#xD;
fair and pure. Just now she looked like a&#xD;
/ "marble saint niched in cathedral-wall," with&#xD;
her white robe falling to her feet, her hair&#xD;
pushed back behind, her dainty ears, and in&#xD;
her slender fingers the glittering beads of a&#xD;
gold-and-amethyst rosary. Something like a&#xD;
luminous calm seem breathed over her. The&#xD;
struggle had been bitter and fierce-had&#xD;
drained, indeed, the very life-blood of the&#xD;
suffering heart-but victory had brought a&#xD;
peace like unto no peace of earth, a peace&#xD;
which comes only as the avant coun-jer of that&#xD;
dread angel whom the children of men account&#xD;
a destroyer, but the children of God a deliv-&#xD;
erer.&#xD;
"Look, Alan!" said Lamar, in a low tone&#xD;
-"look what an exquisite face that girl has!&#xD;
There's something half divine about it, only it&#xD;
seems to me I have seen it somewhere before."&#xD;
"It isn't the extreme of good-breeding to&#xD;
&#xD;
" ONE FACE !"&#xD;
&#xD;
stare at people as you chance to row by their&#xD;
terraces," said Alan, lazy and sleepy, and&#xD;
thoroughly indifferent to all the exquisite faces&#xD;
in the world. "Beauty is the birthright of&#xD;
these Italian women; and as for seeing this&#xD;
face before, you may have seen it on the Corso&#xD;
the other day: a great many Milanese have&#xD;
villas on the lake here."&#xD;
"But look!" persisted Lamar. "We&#xD;
shall be beyond sight in another minute, and&#xD;
I don't think that' a sweeter face was ever&#xD;
seen. The com~?lexion is like a magnolia.&#xD;
petal, and the eyes are full moons, as the&#xD;
Turks say."&#xD;
"Full moons they. may remain for me,"&#xD;
-said Alan. "I would not lift my head just&#xD;
now to see Sabrina herself rise from the lake.&#xD;
I begin to appreciate what dolce for niente&#xD;
means, and-Nix, keep still, sir! What the&#xD;
dcvii is the matter with you ?-Hallo I Look&#xD;
out there, Lamar, or the fool will upset this&#xD;
cockle.shell !"&#xD;
The warning came too late. Nix, who had&#xD;
been whining and moving restlessly ever since&#xD;
they came in front of the terrace, now made a&#xD;
sudden dart overboard, which capsized the&#xD;
craft, and, in a second, the two young men.&#xD;
found themselves in the lake.&#xD;
Now, a plunge-bath is never pleasant, not&#xD;
even when you have had time to think about&#xD;
it. But, when it has the additional drawback&#xD;
of being totally unexpected, it is difficult to&#xD;
imagine any thing more absolutely disagree-&#xD;
able. Leaving the two struggling swimmers&#xD;
to their fate, let us go back a moment and ex-&#xD;
plain the cause of the disaster.&#xD;
It is probable that, by some sympathy&#xD;
known only to canine intelligence, the dog had&#xD;
been aware of the neighborhood of his quon-&#xD;
dam playfellow and patroness, as soon as he&#xD;
came near the villa, but he only manifested&#xD;
this consciousness by restless movement and&#xD;
whining, until they were abreast of the spot&#xD;
where Ermine sat. It was then that she sud-&#xD;
denly exclaimed:&#xD;
"Ah, what a magnificent dog! Look,&#xD;
Miss North-in the stern of the boat! Does&#xD;
he not remind you of-..-of Nix 1"'&#xD;
Low as it was, her voice was singularly&#xD;
clear, and Nix's ears were attentiirely pricked.&#xD;
Lamar saw her lean forward with sudden in-&#xD;
terest and speak to her companion, but he did&#xD;
not catch the words-in consequence of not&#xD;
being gifted with the auditory powers of a&#xD;
dog. The word "Nix" had scarcely passed&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
her bps, however, when the owner of that name&#xD;
sprang overboard; and, disregarding the Ca-&#xD;
tastrophe which he left behind, swam straight&#xD;
toward the terrace.&#xD;
"I never saw-" Miss North was begin-&#xD;
ning, when this event occurred.-" Good Heav-&#xD;
ens!" she cried, springing to her feet. "The&#xD;
dog has capsized the boat I-the men will be&#xD;
drowned! What on earth are we to do?"&#xD;
Though she was unable to do any thing,&#xD;
she ma down to the steps excitedly, while Er-&#xD;
mine sat still, with sympathizing eyes of inter-&#xD;
est on the scene. She soon saw that there&#xD;
was no question of drowning, for both men&#xD;
were expert swimmers. Instead of making&#xD;
any eJlhrt to save their lives, they were simply&#xD;
endeave~iing to save the boat-to catch it, and,&#xD;
if possible, to right it. This, however, was&#xD;
difficult.&#xD;
"Bring it here! -bring it here!" cried&#xD;
Miss North, standing on the steps, and gesticu-&#xD;
lating wildly. The familiar words (used quite&#xD;
unconsciously) rang clearly over the water,&#xD;
making Lamar say to Alan in somewhat splut-&#xD;
tering fashion:&#xD;
"By Jove! those people yonder are Eng-&#xD;
lish-and the old lady is a trump! Look at&#xD;
her, standing on the steps waving her hand-&#xD;
kerchief!" Then he shouted in return:&#xD;
"Thanks 1-we are coming I"&#xD;
"How ridiculous they look!" said Miss&#xD;
North, beginning to laugh as soon as she saw&#xD;
that there was to be no tragedy. "And they&#xD;
are En-~-Oh, you horrid creature! I don't&#xD;
know how you dare to show your face! You&#xD;
are the cause of it all!"&#xD;
These last remarks were addressed to Nix,&#xD;
who just then emerged from the water, and,&#xD;
without stopping fer even a single shake, I&#xD;
rushed past the dismayed lady, full at Ermine.&#xD;
"Nint-it is Nix!" cried the girl, in a&#xD;
voice of mingled amazement, terror and de- t&#xD;
light. "0 my God, what does this mean?-&#xD;
Nix!" a&#xD;
"flow, wow, wow!" said Nix, lifting up l~&#xD;
his great throat, and opening his great mouth&#xD;
to attest his joy. Thea-with a perfect river i~&#xD;
of water pouring from him-he sprang, in his t~&#xD;
old fashion, straight on the trembling gui. a&#xD;
* kiss North gave a shriek, sad flew to the I&#xD;
reseae--for she thought Ermine was verily be- ii&#xD;
lug eateu. .&amp;amp;hin heard the shriek, and, having b&#xD;
seen Nix b~Aind up the steps, suspected what g&#xD;
was the matter (suspected, that is, that the tI&#xD;
dog was making himself obnoxious); so, leav- b&#xD;
&#xD;
ing the boat tto the care of Lamar, he struck&#xD;
out with a will for the villa. In a minute he&#xD;
reached it, and, as he sprang on the stej~e,&#xD;
Miss North turned round.&#xD;
"Oh, sir!" cried she, "for Heaven's sake&#xD;
come quickly! I can't get this dreadful dog&#xD;
away, and I am afraid the young lady has&#xD;
fainted."&#xD;
"Nix, you scoundrel, get down this mm-&#xD;
cried Alan, in wrath, as, giving himself&#xD;
vigorous shake to relieve his clothing of&#xD;
its superfluous weight of water he strode has-&#xD;
tily forward.&#xD;
But the first tone of his voice had fallen&#xD;
like a thunder-clap on the little group. Nix&#xD;
dropped to the ground as if he had been shot&#xD;
-Miss North dropped into a chair, as if she&#xD;
had been shot-while Ermine rose to her feet&#xD;
with a look of such transfigured joy on her&#xD;
face, that "ecstasy" is the only word which&#xD;
will apply to it. There was no amazement,&#xD;
there was no doubt, there was no questioning.&#xD;
Joy was so great and so overwhelming that it&#xD;
swallowed every other feeling, as the ocean&#xD;
swallows the rivers which flow into it.&#xD;
"Alan!" she said, in a tone which neither&#xD;
of the two who heard it ever forgot.&#xD;
Then she made a step forward, and fell&#xD;
lifeless into his arms.&#xD;
-.4--&#xD;
CHAPTER X.&#xD;
THE TIDE GOES OUT.&#xD;
"H&amp;amp;s she fainted?" Alan asked, looking&#xD;
~t Miss North, as his eager words remained&#xD;
unanswered, and he felt the fragile form grow&#xD;
seavy on his arms.&#xD;
"God only knows," was her reply, as she&#xD;
ame forward and touched the marble brow,&#xD;
he nerveless hands, the thread-like pulse.&#xD;
She has only fainted-as yet," she said, after&#xD;
moment. "Bring her into the saloon, and&#xD;
~t me try to recover her."&#xD;
She led the way, and he followed without a&#xD;
Tord, bearing the light burden which he had&#xD;
[sought never to bear again. With him,&#xD;
amazement subordinated every other feeling.&#xD;
row did Ermine, whom he imagined in Paris&#xD;
~ith Madelon and Madame Villarot, come to&#xD;
e here on the Lago di Como with her old&#xD;
overness? His whole frame thrilled with&#xD;
ic passionate delight of feeling her close to&#xD;
un once more; but, even in the first moment&#xD;
&#xD;
of meetiug-that bitter-sweet moment when&#xD;
she came to him straight as the needle to the&#xD;
magnet-he had remembered that she was his&#xD;
brother's wife. Not his-not his-never again&#xD;
his-was the thought which ran through his&#xD;
heart and mind, even while he pressed kiss af-&#xD;
ter kiss on the dark, silken tendrils of ~sair,&#xD;
the pale, unconscious, sculptured face.&#xD;
"Put her down here," said Miss North, in-.&#xD;
dicating a broad couch,~ on the cushions of&#xD;
which a faint impression bore evidence to its&#xD;
having been lately occupied by the same slight&#xD;
figure. "Take that pillow from under her&#xD;
head-now open the blinds, and fan her gen-&#xD;
tly."&#xD;
She crossed the floor and rang a bell-then&#xD;
came back, and, kneeling down by the couch,&#xD;
began to chafe the girl's hands. Her heart&#xD;
sank within her-the swoon was so deep that&#xD;
she almost feared breath would never come&#xD;
again to those halt~unclosed, motionless lips.&#xD;
"On that table yonder you will find a&#xD;
flagon of ammonia," said she, to the drenched&#xD;
Triton beside her. "Bring it here."&#xD;
He moved away-leaving a pool of water&#xD;
on the marble floor to mark where he had&#xD;
stood-and in a second returned with the&#xD;
fia9on. Thcn he, too, knelt down, and laid&#xD;
his hand over the almost silent heart.&#xD;
I can scarcely feel it," he said. "Are-.---&#xD;
are you sure she is not dead?"&#xD;
"Not yet," said Miss North, a little bitter-&#xD;
ly, "but this may kill her. The shock was&#xD;
enough-and then look at these drenched&#xD;
clothes! They must be changed at once.&#xD;
Will you ring the bell again?"&#xD;
He was rising to do so, when a dark-browed&#xD;
Italian maid came hastily into the room.&#xD;
"Ah! Ia signorina, la signorina!" cried she,&#xD;
breaking into lamentations as soon as she&#xD;
caught sight of the motionless, death-like form&#xD;
on the couch. She, too, came and flung her-&#xD;
self on her knees beside it.&#xD;
"Silence, Lucia," said Miss North, in Ital-&#xD;
ian. "She is not dead-she has only fainted.&#xD;
Help me to bring her back to life."&#xD;
"But she has been in the lake, signoral"&#xD;
touchingg the damp, clinging draperies won-&#xD;
deringly).&#xD;
"Not quite---.only something very near it.&#xD;
Go quickly for dry clothes-and bring the&#xD;
brandy with you. As for you" (looking up at&#xD;
Alan, and speaking in English), "you must go,&#xD;
too. Her eyes must not open on your face-&#xD;
that is, if they open at all again. If you will&#xD;
&#xD;
wait yonder "-she pointed to the terrace-" I&#xD;
will come to you in a few minutes."&#xD;
"But you will let me return as soon as&#xD;
she is conscious!" said he, almost imploring-&#xD;
ly.&#xD;
"That will be for her to say," answered&#xD;
Miss North, almost sternly. "Ah, see I-life&#xD;
is coming back. Go!"&#xD;
Life was indeed coming back. Faintly,&#xD;
slowly, with a long, tremulous sigh, the breast&#xD;
began to heave, the lips parted a little wider,.&#xD;
and gave a glimpse of the teeth, like pure,&#xD;
white cocoa-nut within, the dark lashes quiv-&#xD;
ered, and it was evident that in another mo-&#xD;
ment the white lids would lift.&#xD;
"Go!" repeated the ex-govemness, impera-&#xD;
tively. "It will never do for her to see you&#xD;
here. Go l"&#xD;
"I am going," he answered, in a low voice..&#xD;
And, with one lingering glance, he went.&#xD;
On the terrace outside Nix was lying, look-&#xD;
ing very crestfallen; on the steps Lamar was&#xD;
standing, a dripping Triton number two, watch-&#xD;
ing the boat with a rueful face as it lazily&#xD;
floated farther and farther away.&#xD;
"I say, Erie," he cried, as soon as Alan&#xD;
appeared, "don't you think these good Sainar--&#xD;
itaus must have a boat? Everybody has, you&#xD;
know. If they would be good enough to lend&#xD;
it to us, we could catch that confounded craft&#xD;
quick enough. As it is, what the devil will.&#xD;
old Beppo say?"&#xD;
"Let himsay what he pleases," said Alan,.&#xD;
flinging himself into the first one of the vacant&#xD;
chairs. "The thing will be picked up some--&#xD;
where-and we can pay him foi~ damages."&#xD;
"He'll swear it hadn't a sound plank left&#xD;
in it!" grumbled Lamar, watching the truant~&#xD;
craft. "And yonder goes my hat following&#xD;
leisurely in the wake! Well" (sitting down&#xD;
on the topmost step), "I suppose it is the&#xD;
will of God! That is what these ?ious people-&#xD;
say whenever any thing happens-Nix, you&#xD;
raseal, come near me, will you, and I'll take~&#xD;
pleasure in breaking every bone in your*&#xD;
body!"&#xD;
"Here's a chair, Lamar," said Alan.&#xD;
"I look like sitting in a chair, don't I? "&#xD;
said Lamar, surveying himself grimly. "By..&#xD;
the-way, Alan, was the young lady hurt or only-&#xD;
frightened? I think that dog of yours must&#xD;
have gone out of his wits."&#xD;
"Nix recognized her," said Alan, putting&#xD;
out his hand to pat the dos's great, curlr&#xD;
head. "But for him, I should lnwe passed b~&#xD;

108                       EBB-TIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
without even faintly guessing who was so near&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"What! you know her?"&#xD;
"Know her! It was Ermine St. .Amand!"&#xD;
Lamar sprang to his feet-sat down again&#xD;
-gave a long whistle-and finally said:&#xD;
"By Jove!"&#xD;
After a while, ho recovered sufficiently to&#xD;
add something else. "I thought I knew her!&#xD;
I thought I could not be mistaken in imagine.&#xD;
ing that I had seen that face! What did she&#xD;
do when she saw you, old fellow?"&#xD;
"Fainted," said Alan, laconically.&#xD;
"And has she come to, yet?"&#xD;
"Not yet."&#xD;
"By Jove!" said Lamar, again.&#xD;
Then he suddenly dashed his hands into&#xD;
his hair and tossed it about in such an extraor.&#xD;
diary fashion, that he speedily assumed the&#xD;
appearance of a well.drenehed maniac.&#xD;
"This is horribly awkward," said he-" for&#xD;
you, at least. I say, Alan, can't we get away?&#xD;
There must be some way of leaving here by&#xD;
land! For Heaven's sake, let us try it!"&#xD;
"Isball not stir a foot," said Alan. "Fate,&#xD;
chance, the mercy ot God, what you please,&#xD;
brought me here. Being here, I shall stay."&#xD;
"But, my dear fellow, you know you can't&#xD;
-you know it is impossible! What good will&#xD;
it do? Come, be reasonable! You will do&#xD;
the poor girl herself an inestimable benefit, if&#xD;
you will only go before she comes out of her&#xD;
swoon."&#xD;
"Stand back, Lamar!" said Alan, shaking&#xD;
off the hand which the other, coming forward,&#xD;
had lain on his shoulder. "Don't try to&#xD;
preach to me! By God, I will not endure it!&#xD;
I see in her face that she is dying !-do you&#xD;
hear me ?-dyinq I-and no power of earth&#xD;
shall tear me away from her now."&#xD;
"But w~at is the good of it?" persisted&#xD;
Lamar. "Youknow as well as I do that she&#xD;
is married."&#xD;
"That she is what? " asked a sudden, deep&#xD;
voice behind the young men.&#xD;
They both turned quickly, and faced Miss&#xD;
North. Unperceived, she had come through&#xD;
the open window of the saloon, and, advan-&#xD;
cing on them from the rear, had caught Lamar's&#xD;
last words.&#xD;
"Of whom are you speaking?" demanded&#xD;
she, looking from one to the other. "Who is&#xD;
married?"&#xD;
"We were speaking of Miss St. Amand,"&#xD;
said Alan, as Lamar's self-possession entirely&#xD;
&#xD;
failed. "My friend was reminding me that&#xD;
she is married. It is a fact which I had not&#xD;
forgotten-which I am not likely to forget."&#xD;
"It is a lie, rather, of which you have&#xD;
come in time to hear the contradiction," said&#xD;
she, almost fiercely. *" Come away-farther&#xD;
away! Ermine must not overhear this."&#xD;
She walked quickly to the farther end of&#xD;
the terrace, and Alan followed. Lamar, with&#xD;
instinctive delicacy, remained where he was.&#xD;
"The devil is to pay!" he thought. "They&#xD;
won't want me!"&#xD;
They did not want him in the sense of&#xD;
needing him, but neither of them would have&#xD;
heajtated to speak freely before him-Miss&#xD;
North, because she would willingly have told&#xD;
her indignant story to the whole world; Alan,&#xD;
because a sincere and abiding friendship had&#xD;
long since sprung up between himself and the&#xD;
young Georgian. If Lamar had followed them,&#xD;
he would have seen how quickly two honest,&#xD;
straightforward natures can tear away the&#xD;
veil which falsehood or intrigue may have&#xD;
woven before the truth.&#xD;
Alan's side of the story we know.&#xD;
Miss North's was this: The year before&#xD;
she had been teaching in Montreal, when she&#xD;
met the Eric party, who, en masse, had accom-&#xD;
panied the Saxtons on their bridal tour. Er.&#xD;
mine was delighted to see her ci-devant govern.&#xD;
ess, and they were together a great deal. The&#xD;
girl was very sad concerning Alan, from whom&#xD;
she had not heard for a long time, and it was&#xD;
evident to the keen eyes of the shrewd English-&#xD;
woman that the family determination to marry&#xD;
her to Raymond was, if possible, on the in-&#xD;
crease. "But she was like a ~ock," said this&#xD;
faithful friend; "I have never seen constancy&#xD;
and resolution that equalled hers, with all her&#xD;
childlike gentleness. After a while, they re-&#xD;
signed their persecutions for a time; and I&#xD;
think they had almost resigned all hope of&#xD;
compassing their end, when the news of your&#xD;
death came.&#xD;
"I cannot tell you what that news was to&#xD;
Ermine. You must look at her face to read it&#xD;
there. My poor words would very faintly de-&#xD;
scribe such a death-blow to hope, and love, and&#xD;
life. It has simply killed her. Well, they&#xD;
scarcely gave the desolate child time to realize&#xD;
her grief, before the plots, and plans, and per-&#xD;
secutions, began afresh. Mr. Erie came on in&#xD;
person, and I have always suspected that he&#xD;
originated and was chief in executing the&#xD;
scheme which was finally carried out when&#xD;
&#xD;
I,&#xD;
&#xD;
THE TIDE GOES OUT.&#xD;
&#xD;
they found that the will which opposed them&#xD;
was like granite. He paid me the compliment&#xD;
of suspecting that I inspired Ermine's ob-&#xD;
stinacy, so his first move was to carry the&#xD;
whole party oft' to New York, under pretence&#xD;
of seeing the sailors who had arrived at that&#xD;
port and hearing the whole truth of your ship-&#xD;
wreck. I confess I was very uneasy after they&#xD;
left. Ermine was in that horrible numb state&#xD;
which follows a great shock, and I feared that,&#xD;
in her lethargic indifference to every thing&#xD;
concerning herself, she might be persuaded or&#xD;
forced to ruin her life forever, as such a mar-&#xD;
riage would ruin it. Judge, then, of my relief,&#xD;
when, after an ominous silence of several&#xD;
weeks, I received a very gracious letter from&#xD;
Mrs. Erie, begging me to come to New York&#xD;
and thknce accompany Ermine to Germany,&#xD;
where she desired to go and study art. I&#xD;
threw up my situation and went at once.&#xD;
When I reached New York, I found your&#xD;
brother engaged to Madelon Lautrec."&#xD;
"To Madelon Lautrec!"&#xD;
"Yes, to Madden Laiitrec. Worked upon&#xD;
.by every possible appeal to her generosity, in-&#xD;
different to every thing save her determination&#xD;
to remain faithful to your memory, and anxious&#xD;
only to be left in peace, Ermine had made&#xD;
over her fortune to her cousin, between whom&#xD;
and your brother a mercenary bargain was&#xD;
speedily struck. I found that, of all her&#xD;
wealth, she had retained only a portion suffi-&#xD;
cient to insure a support apart from exertio~as&#xD;
which might have proved unsuccessful, and at&#xD;
least could not soon have been remunerative.&#xD;
The whole thing seemed simple enough to her.&#xD;
To be relieved from the anxiety of wealth, for&#xD;
which she had no love, to be able to go to&#xD;
Europe, and to endeavor to forget her desola-&#xD;
tion in the' arf to which she was born, this&#xD;
was all for which she cared. This was all she&#xD;
did. Of the fraud which came after, her&#xD;
hands were skinless."&#xD;
"How, then, did it come? How could she&#xD;
be robbed, not only of her fortune, but of her&#xD;
vcry identity, without at least permitting it?"&#xD;
"Listen: you shall hear. 'If you are&#xD;
going to Europe to study art as a profession,&#xD;
and if you mean to make your bread by it,'&#xD;
said Mrs. Erie, 'you must take some other&#xD;
name than your own. I cannot suffer my&#xD;
daughter to do such a thing as my daughter.'&#xD;
(You remember Ermine had surrendered her&#xD;
fortune to save her step-father from bankrupt-&#xD;
cy.) 'Well, mamma,' said Ermine, listlessly, 'I&#xD;
&#xD;
promise that you shall not be disgraced by my&#xD;
labors. Tell me what name to take, and no&#xD;
one who knew me as Mademoiselle St. Amand&#xD;
shall know me as an art-student. What shall&#xD;
I call myself?' I remember how Mrs. Erie&#xD;
seemed to think for a moment before she&#xD;
said: 'Suppose that, as Madelon is about to re-&#xD;
sign her name, you were to take that? It is a&#xD;
family name; there was a autrec St. Amand&#xD;
several generations ago, a d therefore not like&#xD;
one which would be only assumed.' Ermine&#xD;
assented to this as indifferently as she assented&#xD;
to every thing else, and also bound herself not&#xD;
to seek out her relations in France. You will&#xD;
consider me very stupid, perhaps, that I did&#xD;
not see the drift of all this, that I did not sus-&#xD;
pect the contemplated change of identity, but&#xD;
in truth people are slow to see such things&#xD;
when they occur under their own eyes. In&#xD;
books we are always expecting wiles, and in-&#xD;
trigues,~and villanies, but, in real life, nothing&#xD;
is farther from our thoughts. We can scarce-&#xD;
ly realize it, in fact, when it is forced upon&#xD;
our perception. Ermine and I sailed from&#xD;
New York before the marriage, and it was not&#xD;
until long afterward that I began to think&#xD;
what had been done. I was not sure of it,&#xD;
however, until I came out and heard your&#xD;
friend say that Ermine was married. Then,&#xD;
like a flash, I understood every thing.&#xD;
"Well" (as he stood utterly silent, utterly&#xD;
passive, stunned apparently by the blackness&#xD;
of the abyss of treachery into which he had&#xD;
fallen)," you wonder, perhaps, how we came&#xD;
here. We went to Germany, as I have already&#xD;
said, to Munich, to Dresden, to Dusseldorf.&#xD;
But even art had lost all power over Ermine.&#xD;
She looked with strange, absent eyes at the&#xD;
most beautiful pictures; she would sit before&#xD;
her easel with her brush in her hand all day,&#xD;
and scarcely paint a stroke. At last she took&#xD;
a cold, which very much alarmed me. She&#xD;
never complained, but she wasted away like a&#xD;
shadow, and at last I called in a physician.&#xD;
He told me that the climate was too severe for&#xD;
her, that I must bring her to Italy. 'She is a&#xD;
child of the South,' he said, 'and the South&#xD;
alone can cure her.' But he was wrong; the&#xD;
South has not cured her. Slowly but surely&#xD;
she has faded awaybefore my eyes.. We spent&#xD;
the spring in Rome, and, as summer came on,&#xD;
moved gradually northward. I was anxious&#xD;
to go to Lake Leman,~but Ermin&amp;amp; clung ~o&#xD;
Italy. She could not bettr to cross the Alps;&#xD;
and so we stayed here until her strength was&#xD;

'I&#xD;

EBB-TIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
~too far spent to take any journey whatever.&#xD;
An English friend of mine who occupied this&#xD;
villa was suddenly summoned home, and we&#xD;
moved into it. It would bave been a charm-&#xD;
ing place to linger in, only-only&#xD;
She stopped short and her fortitude gave&#xD;
way, Leaning down on the carved balustrade&#xD;
below which the magical waters, that a hun-&#xD;
.lred poets have sung, were softly plashing,&#xD;
she burst ~into a passion of tears.&#xD;
"0 my God! my God! is not this too&#xD;
bitter 1" she cried. "If you had come one&#xD;
month earlier, there might have been hope-&#xD;
who can say? Now, you have only come to&#xD;
fill, with the longings of time, the ~pirit which&#xD;
stands on the brink of eternity! Oh, it is too&#xD;
cruel! Oh, it is too hard! Oh, why has it&#xD;
been permitted!"&#xD;
So she moaned to herself in the anguish of&#xD;
her grief and love, while Alan-dry-eyed, and&#xD;
as he felt, almost dry.hearte4.-qnietly watched&#xD;
her. With him, even grief ~was swallowed up&#xD;
in the passionate desire for revenge which&#xD;
took possession of his soul like a burning tem-&#xD;
pest. There were solace and comfort there at&#xD;
least. He would fulfil his vow, he would re-&#xD;
turn every pang which she had suffered, every&#xD;
tear which she had shed, on the authors of&#xD;
this treacherous wrong He would hurl them&#xD;
down from their high places in the world's&#xD;
esteem, and point them out as the cowardly&#xD;
traitors which they were. He would hold&#xD;
them to account for the life which they had&#xD;
murdered. And then he, too, broke down,&#xD;
not in sobs, but in one great groan, which&#xD;
seemed as if it might have rent his chest asun-&#xD;
der. The thought which proved too much&#xD;
for him was, how near he had been to the&#xD;
truth in Paris; how only a thin veil had sepa-&#xD;
rated him them from the knowledge which was&#xD;
now gained, too late. Alas! it is just such&#xD;
veils as these-such fine, impalpable tissues of&#xD;
falsehood, or deception, or r1iisunderstanding-&#xD;
which make more than hale the bitter misery&#xD;
of this bitter life.&#xD;
"Don't regret that I have come," said he,&#xD;
at last, almost harshly. "Don't grudge me&#xD;
one hour of happiness to sweeten a lifetime of&#xD;
desolation! Don't think that, if angels and&#xD;
saints arc calling her, she will pine to stay&#xD;
with me! God did not mean that she should&#xD;
pass away holding a lie for truth, and so He&#xD;
sent me. So long as He gives me life, I shall&#xD;
thank him that He did so. After Him, I&#xD;
thank Lamar, who would insist on coming&#xD;
&#xD;
here, though I have long been feverishly&#xD;
anxious to go back to the sea."&#xD;
"And so you had given her up?"&#xD;
"Could I do other? Ah, how could I&#xD;
dream-each day I have hoped that, perhaps&#xD;
with every hour, she was drawing nearer to&#xD;
happiness?"&#xD;
"And so she has been," said Miss North,&#xD;
gently. "After all, does not God know best?&#xD;
Nothing is chance. He would have sent you&#xD;
before this, if he had meant you to come.&#xD;
But" (with a sudden start), "you must go now&#xD;
and dry your clothes, you and your friend.&#xD;
I have neglected it so long, that I am afraid&#xD;
you will both be ill. Yonder is Lucia; she will&#xD;
show you a room. When you are ready, come&#xD;
back here to the terrace, and I will let you see&#xD;
Ermine."&#xD;
/&#xD;
Three hours later, the golden day is slowly&#xD;
drawing to its close. Fair, on the immemorhl&#xD;
mountains that mirror themselves in the azure&#xD;
waters below, sleeps the incarnadine glory of&#xD;
an Italian sunset. A thousand sweet sounds&#xD;
and perfumes, sounds and perfumes fraught&#xD;
with the aroma of enchanted Italy, steal in&#xD;
through the open easement of the saloon to&#xD;
the dying girl lying there so quietly at peace.&#xD;
The loveliest ~cene of earth is spread before&#xD;
her eyes, but it may be that already the gaze&#xD;
of the spirit h~s caught the marvellous towers&#xD;
and battlements of that fair "city of the&#xD;
saints of God," beside which all earthly beauty&#xD;
pales into insignificance. At least these things&#xD;
* appeal but faintly to her now. The tide is&#xD;
going out, going so gently, that those around&#xD;
can scarcely realize how near at hand is the&#xD;
last ebb. Alan, who has seen men die, can&#xD;
scarcely force himself to believe that this is&#xD;
death, that any child of earth can lie in the&#xD;
embrace of the terrible messenger as if en-&#xD;
circled by a mother's arms. At one side of&#xD;
the couch he kneels: at the other, Miss North&#xD;
is seated; Lucia is at the foot, sobbing over&#xD;
an ivory crucifix; Lamar slowly paces the ter.&#xD;
race outside. It is only within the last few&#xD;
minutes that these have been called in. For&#xD;
nearly three hours the two so cruelly kept&#xD;
asunder, so strangely brought together, were&#xD;
left alone. What passed in that last interview,&#xD;
none knew, save, indeed, that Ermine's dying&#xD;
prayer had made her love forego his revenge.&#xD;
"Leave them to God, dear love-oh, leave&#xD;
them to God!" she said. "It seems almost&#xD;
too hard that we should have been kept apart&#xD;
&#xD;
THE TIDE GOES OUT.&#xD;
&#xD;
so long !-that we should meet now only to&#xD;
say good-by !-that we should have suffered so&#xD;
much and so bitterly !-but remember how&#xD;
they will have to answer for every causeless&#xD;
pang at God's tribunal, and ' do not darken&#xD;
your soul by usurping His office. You see"&#xD;
-putting her tender arms around the throat,&#xD;
which something was almost choking-" I am&#xD;
going first, but I shall watch and wait for you,&#xD;
and 0 Alan, dear Alan, try to come! It&#xD;
seems to mc that I shall miss your face even&#xD;
in paradise!"&#xD;
"My darling, I will try!" he answered,&#xD;
brokenly. "Tell mc how."&#xD;
Then in her sweet, low voice she told him&#xD;
things which have no place in such a page as&#xD;
this. Some themes are too holy to be handled~&#xD;
save by ~ reverent pen for reverent eyes to&#xD;
read. It is enough that on her death-bed this&#xD;
frail, dying girl spoke some simple words which&#xD;
God was good enough to touch, as it were,&#xD;
with Ills divine power, and which, falling deep&#xD;
into the heart of her listener, brought ~rtls&#xD;
good fruit in the after-time.&#xD;
But all this is over now. The long exer~&#xD;
tion has taxed her strength so much that she&#xD;
can only lie with her head pillowed on Alan's&#xD;
arm, her eyes in their deep gladness fixed on&#xD;
his face-aud, so resting, softly pass from time&#xD;
into eternity. The good priest who was there&#xD;
in the morning had given her the last rites of&#xD;
the Church, and she had refused to allow him&#xD;
to be summoned again.&#xD;
"It is useless," she said. "It would only&#xD;
trouble him-and he looked sick when he left&#xD;
this morning. Give him my love and my rosa.&#xD;
ry, dear Miss North, and tell him how grate.&#xD;
ful I am for his great kindness to me."&#xD;
No one was forgotten in these souvenirs-&#xD;
even Lamar received a tiny gold charm from&#xD;
her chdtelaine, "In memory of your shower-&#xD;
bath," she said, with a smile, which the y6ung&#xD;
man thought was the sweetest he had ever&#xD;
seen.&#xD;
And so, while they watch and u ait, the&#xD;
sun begins to sink. The "vast-skirted clouds"&#xD;
gather about the lofty peaks, and form har-&#xD;
monies of color for which language has scarce-&#xD;
ly a name. The waters of the lake catch the&#xD;
glory and give it back increased a thousand-&#xD;
fold. The golden and rose-colored tints fling&#xD;
a tender radiance into the saloon, filling it&#xD;
with a strange, luminous light, like the atmos~&#xD;
phere with which some of the old painters sur-&#xD;
round the figure of a saint.&#xD;
&#xD;
111&#xD;
&#xD;
"How lovely!" says Ermine, turning her&#xD;
languid gaze to the shining waters outside.&#xD;
"Alan, do you remember the evening before&#xD;
you went away, when we stood on the Battery&#xD;
and watched the sun go down over the bay of&#xD;
Charleston? It was not half as fair as this&#xD;
peerless Lago di Como, yet it seems to me&#xD;
that I can see it all now-and your smile when&#xD;
you said, 'Only four months to wait!"'&#xD;
Alan cannot answer. The scene of which&#xD;
she speaks comes back to him, too-the famil-&#xD;
iar h -scene on which his eyes have gazed&#xD;
a t usan times-on which, if they ever gaze&#xD;
a am, it ust be alone! He remembers how&#xD;
looming and lovely with the tints of youth&#xD;
and health was the pale face beside him, then&#xD;
-and, so remembering, a great ocean of bitter:&#xD;
ness once more wells up in his heart.&#xD;
"Oh, my darling! my darling!" he cries,&#xD;
throwing his arms around her and straining&#xD;
her passionately tb him. "Stay with me!-&#xD;
stay with me! My God, what shall I do with&#xD;
this useless life of mine when you have gone&#xD;
from it forever?"&#xD;
"Forever is not of time," answers she,&#xD;
softly-even this passionate cry being unable&#xD;
to stir the ineffable peace which Death brings&#xD;
with him to the great in faith and the pure of&#xD;
heart -"that belongs to eternity, Alan. 0&#xD;
ddar love, may it indeed belong to eternity&#xD;
for us!"&#xD;
"But I cannot give you up to eternity-I&#xD;
will not give you up!" cries he, madly. "0&#xD;
Ermine, try to stay! Are we not told that all&#xD;
things are possible to will? Surely your place&#xD;
is here! Surely God does not want you as I&#xD;
do!" cried the poor fellow, in the greatness&#xD;
of his grief unconscious of his own irreverent&#xD;
words.&#xD;
Something like a look of pain crossing her&#xD;
f&amp;amp;ce, however, makes him suddenly aware that&#xD;
this fever of earth is marring the calm which&#xD;
is already of heaven.&#xD;
"But suppose I would rather go?" she&#xD;
whispers. "For a long time death was very&#xD;
terrible to me, and I shrank from it-but now&#xD;
it seems so easy. Pain and strife are all gone&#xD;
-and would you bring them back? Ab,&#xD;
Alan, you say our Lord does nQt want me. At&#xD;
least He loves me, for He takes me from every&#xD;
possible grief of life, to give me this painless&#xD;
death in your dear arms-and ah, who can&#xD;
tell what more beside! But for your grief,&#xD;
poor love, I should be quite happy!"&#xD;
At this he chokes it back. After all, life&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;

EBB-TIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
is long, and he has all its years for mourning&#xD;
-if he choose to use them for such a purpose.&#xD;
Surely, then, he can refrain from breaking the&#xD;
divine peace which hedges around this gentle&#xD;
handmaid of the Great King-this tender mar.&#xD;
tyr, who bore her cross unflinchingly until she&#xD;
sank in the dust of the wayside, and to whom&#xD;
has come now the rest which follows faithful&#xD;
combat.&#xD;
" Alan," whispers again the sweet voice&#xD;
whose music will soon be hushed for earth,&#xD;
"will you promise me once more that you will&#xD;
not endeavor to avenge our wrongs.-on any&#xD;
one9?"                 --&#xD;
She had read well the direction of his&#xD;
thoughts, she had understood well the ominous&#xD;
knitting of his brows. He started, and blushed&#xD;
like a convicted school-boy.&#xD;
" My darling," he said, " can you not trust&#xD;
me to do what is right, can you not believe-"&#xD;
" You must promise me,"' she interrupted,&#xD;
eagerly. " I cannot die in peace unless you&#xD;
do. I will not leave you with a possible sin to&#xD;
stain your soul, and perhaps-who knows-.&#xD;
keep us apart forever.-Lucia!1"&#xD;
She extended one transparent hand, and&#xD;
Lucia-seeing what she meant-placed the cru.-&#xD;
cifix in it.&#xD;
"Promise me on this!" she said to Alan.&#xD;
" See !-I cannot argue with you any more ; I&#xD;
can only ask it of your love. Remember it is&#xD;
the last gift you will ever be able to give to&#xD;
mec." -&#xD;
He bends his head, and, taking her hand,&#xD;
kisses the crucifix which she holds before him.&#xD;
" I promise," he said ; then, with a burst,&#xD;
"0O Ermine,- there is nothing I would not&#xD;
promise you !-but this is hard !"&#xD;
" Is it ?" said she, with a tender smile.&#xD;
" Where there is no sacrifice, there is no merit.&#xD;
Our Lord will know how to repay you nll it&#xD;
costs. One thipg more, and I am done: will you&#xD;
give this to Mdelon "-she unclasped a small&#xD;
cross and chain from her neck--" and tell her&#xD;
from me that I beg her, by the love she used to&#xD;
bear me, to take her own name, and, for her&#xD;
soul's sake, not to live under the weight of a&#xD;
constant lie ?: Give her my love, but say noth-&#xD;
ing of my forgiveness-I cannot think that it&#xD;
is needed ; I cannot think. that she dreamed&#xD;
of this."                             '.&#xD;
He took the chain and looked at it irreso.-&#xD;
lutely. -He knew that he could not trust him-&#xD;
self to see the treacherous woman from whom&#xD;
he had parted in unsuspecting friendship.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Cnn I not send it in a letter ?" he asked,&#xD;
at last*.&#xD;
"Yes," she answered, "that will do. I&#xD;
have written myself." Then, after a short pause,&#xD;
she glanced at the maid.-" Lucia, is it not&#xD;
nearly time for the Angelus ? " .      ,&#xD;
" It will ring in a few minutes,sinr,&#xD;
answered Lucia, sadly-..&#xD;
"Then say the Litany for a Departing SouL'&#xD;
I am a little tired now."&#xD;
The girl at once began the litany in the&#xD;
usual sing -song Italian fashion. All was&#xD;
hushed and silent in the saloon, while her&#xD;
voice rose and fell over every supplication-.&#xD;
The cadenced tones came out to Lamar, and,&#xD;
though he did not recognize the beautiful&#xD;
words which they chanted, instinct made him&#xD;
pause in his tread. He knew the end must&#xD;
be at hand. Meanwhile, Ermine lay white and&#xD;
silent as a lily in her lover's arms, and, even&#xD;
when the last supplication had died away, she&#xD;
remained so motionless that Miss North's heart&#xD;
stood still.&#xD;
" Ermine !" she said, leaning over.&#xD;
But the soul had not yet gone. The lids -&#xD;
lifted from the dark eyes-the light of affec-&#xD;
tion flashed into them. She held out her arms&#xD;
toward her faithful nurse.&#xD;
"Kiss me!" she faltered, gently. "I-I&#xD;
think it is very near."&#xD;
After this long embrace was over, she gave&#xD;
a kind farewell to Lucia-whose passionate&#xD;
grief alone found vent in sobs-then, looking&#xD;
up at Alan, she smiled faintly, and said-&#xD;
"Nix ! "&#xD;
In a few minutes the dog was brought.&#xD;
IHe seemed to know that something not usual&#xD;
was the matter, for he scarcely needed his&#xD;
master's warning, and placed his leonine paws&#xD;
with great gentleness on the couch. For the&#xD;
last time those slender, wasted arms went&#xD;
round his massive throat.&#xD;
" Good-by, dear old fellow !" she said,&#xD;
with loving tinderness-and kissed him gently&#xD;
between the ty s that were gazing at her with&#xD;
such strangji, w stful intelligence.&#xD;
"Let hi~ saay," she murmured, brokenly,&#xD;
as Alan triegl tc make him go away. " He re-&#xD;
minds me of the old times-the dear old times!&#xD;
Love, do you remember them ? Ah, how&#xD;
happy we were -Is it not something to have&#xD;
been so happy onc? "&#xD;
Then the Iids fell again. Her head lay on&#xD;
his shoulder-for ie had raised. her that she&#xD;
might give her fiirewells-and her pure, ala-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE TIDE&#xD;
baster cheek rested against his own, hot with&#xD;
the fever which was consuming him. His&#xD;
passionate kisses woke no flush on the white&#xD;
skin, kindled no fire on the sweet lips. Even&#xD;
when he called her name in love's tenderest&#xD;
tone, the dark lashes which veiled her eyes&#xD;
scarcely trembled-.&#xD;
But now the sun had gone, and suddenly&#xD;
over the shining waters came the soft sound&#xD;
of a bell chiming from the tower of an embow-&#xD;
ered convent not far away. As Lucia sank on&#xD;
herknees, and Miss North involuntarily followed&#xD;
her example, the lids lifted once more from&#xD;
those eyes which Alan had thought closed for-.&#xD;
&#xD;
GOES OUT.                             113&#xD;
ever. Feebly she raised her hand and made&#xD;
the familiar sign of the cross. Her ear caught&#xD;
the familiar words which Lucia was sobbing&#xD;
forth. When the verse was ended, she joined&#xD;
softly in the "Ave."&#xD;
" Hail, Mary, full of grace-"&#xD;
There the voice stopped-forever The&#xD;
last words she spoke on earth were the words&#xD;
uttered eighteen hundred years ago by the&#xD;
angel of the Annunciation to the Holy Virgin&#xD;
of Nazareth.r&#xD;
And so, while the whole world of faith&#xD;
were on their knees, the tide ebbed gently&#xD;
away upon the Unknown Sea.&#xD;
&#xD;
S&#xD;

MISS INGLESBY'S SISTER-IN-LAW.&#xD;
&#xD;
'a&#xD;
&#xD;
A STORY IJV~ SIX CHAPTJiR~&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
'~r WONDER what she will be like?" said&#xD;
.1-. prel~ty Rose Inglesby, half musingly,&#xD;
half pettishly. "She might have had con-&#xD;
sideration enough to send one her photo-~&#xD;
graph! It is very tantalizing to be expect-&#xD;
ing a woman, and not even to know what she&#xD;
looks like-not even, in a generaL way, wheth-&#xD;
er she is pretty or ugly. Suppose I toss up a&#xD;
sixpence, and decide that point at least by&#xD;
heads and tails? Mamma, have you a six-&#xD;
pence?~~&#xD;
"Don't be foolish, Rose," answered Mrs.&#xD;
Inglesby, placidly.&#xD;
This was Mrs. Inglesby's usual reply to&#xD;
her daughter's usual flow of gay nonsense;&#xD;
and on this occasion the remark had a de-&#xD;
cidedly sedative effect. Miss Inglesby leaned&#xD;
back, yawned, and said no more. The flies&#xD;
hummed drowsily, the clock ticked obtrusive-&#xD;
ly, and for five minutes an unbroken silence&#xD;
reigned in the bowery drawing - room, with&#xD;
its lace curtains and India matting, its grace-.&#xD;
ful furniture, and cool, Venetian blinds. The&#xD;
two ladies, who were its only occupants, had&#xD;
the width of the room between them; and,&#xD;
although it was evident that they were both&#xD;
enduring that unpleasant expectation which&#xD;
is the same in kind, however much it may&#xD;
differ in degree, whether a battle or a guest&#xD;
is impending, yet it was also evident that they&#xD;
bore this trying ordeal very differently. Mrs.&#xD;
Inglesby-a model of the "fair, fat, and&#xD;
forty" type of good looks-seemed indemni-&#xD;
fying herself for her broken siesta by a luxu-&#xD;
rious rest in a deepfauteuil, while Rose-wh~o&#xD;
was seated in an inscrutable school-girl fash-&#xD;
ion in the corner of a sofa-did not keep still&#xD;
&#xD;
for two consecutive seconds, At last, rest.&#xD;
lessness prevailed over indolence, and with a&#xD;
quick motion she rose to her feet.&#xD;
"This is intolerable I" she said. "What&#xD;
with the heat, and the waiting, and the un-&#xD;
certainty, I am so nervous I don't know what&#xD;
to do with myself. Mamma" (indignantly),&#xD;
"I believe you are absolutely asleep!"&#xD;
"No I am not," said Mrs. Inglesby, inn.&#xD;
suspiciously drowsy tone of denial.&#xD;
"I only wish I was!" said Rose; and&#xD;
then she began pacing to and fro. As she&#xD;
moved across the floor, practising various&#xD;
steps, and various modes of carrying her&#xD;
shoulders and arms, by way of passing the&#xD;
time, she suddenly caught a glimpse of her-&#xD;
self in a large mirror, and this glimpse made&#xD;
her pause. She stopped and gazed, fascinated,&#xD;
as any one else might have been, by the fresh.&#xD;
ness of her complexion, the grace of her feat-&#xD;
ures, the sheen of her hair; and as she gazed&#xD;
she smiled-.-.first unconsciously at her own&#xD;
loveliness, then consciously at her own vanity.&#xD;
"Mamma," she said-paused a moment,&#xD;
considered, and finally went on-." mamma, I&#xD;
wonder if she will be prettier than I am?"&#xD;
"Prettier than you are!" echoed Mrs.&#xD;
Inglesby, with a start. Then she looked up&#xD;
at her daughter, and it was easy to see from&#xD;
the coolness with which she went on that this&#xD;
egregious want of modesty was not uncommon&#xD;
on Miss Inglesby's part. "I can't say, Rose;&#xD;
but I should think it was very probable. She&#xD;
had quite a reputation before she was married,&#xD;
you know; and Harry-..poor fellow ?-always&#xD;
spoke of her as a great beauty."&#xD;
"I have something of a reputation, too,"&#xD;
said Rose, still looking at herself In the glass&#xD;
"and if I married r am sure I should feel very&#xD;

116               MISS INGLESBY'S SISTER-IN-LAW.                                                    MISS INGLESBY'S SISTER-IN-LAW.              11 ~'&#xD;
&#xD;
badly if my husband did not think I was a~&#xD;
great beauty. Thank you for your informa-&#xD;
tion, mamma; but neither of those two points&#xD;
is very novel or very conclusive. She really&#xD;
might have had sufficient consideration to&#xD;
send one her photograph," repeated the&#xD;
young lady, impatiently. "This uncertainty&#xD;
will drive me distracted I"&#xD;
"Isn't that five o'clock striking?" asked&#xD;
Mrs. Inglesby. "The train is due so soon&#xD;
now that it would hardly be worth while to&#xD;
go distracted, I think, Rose."&#xD;
"It is due at 5.10, I believe," sa~id&#xD;
Rose.&#xD;
This reflection sobered her, for she walked&#xD;
to the window and looked out silently on the&#xD;
broad street with its rows of green shade-&#xD;
trees, the golden sunshine streaming through&#xD;
them, and the long shadows thrown across.&#xD;
She made a pretty picture, standing by the&#xD;
window in the green dimness of its half-closed&#xD;
blinds, with the lace curtains all around her,&#xD;
and a hanging basket swinging just above her&#xD;
head-such a pretty picture that a gentleman,&#xD;
who at this moment came down the quiet&#xD;
street, paused suddenly at sight of it. He&#xD;
was a dark, slender man, of medium size, who,&#xD;
as he paused, took off his hat and spoke in&#xD;
the tone and with the manner of a familiar&#xD;
acquaintance.&#xD;
"Good - evening, Miss Inglesby. What&#xD;
miracle have I to thank for the unexpected&#xD;
pleasure of seeing you? It surely must have&#xD;
been a miracle to bring you down from your&#xD;
siesta at five o'clock on such an afternoon as&#xD;
this-the warmest of the season, everybody&#xD;
says."&#xD;
"Good . evening, Mr. Keunon," returned&#xD;
Miss Inglesby, with a smile and a blush.&#xD;
"You haven't any miracle at all to thank for&#xD;
seeing me. I cut short my siesta unwillingly&#xD;
enough, I assure you; and I only did so be-&#xD;
cause we are expecting my sister-in-law this&#xD;
afternoon."&#xD;
"Your sister-in-law I" he repeated, start-&#xD;
ing slightly, and, as it were, unconsciously.&#xD;
"Yes, my sister-in-law. Is that a vety&#xD;
disagreeable anticipation? You look as if&#xD;
you thought so."&#xD;
"Did I look so? Well, it is disagreeable&#xD;
so far-that I can't ask permission to ring&#xD;
the door-bell and profit by your exemplary&#xD;
virtue."&#xD;
"No, I am afraid you can't. The train is&#xD;
due by this time, and no doubt they will be&#xD;
&#xD;
here very soon-more's the pity l" added&#xD;
she, with a grimace.&#xD;
"Yes, the train is due," said he, glancing,&#xD;
at his watch; "but it will be some time be-&#xD;
fore your sister-in-law can arrive - fifteen&#xD;
minutes, at least. That gives me ten. I hope&#xD;
I am not detaining you from any thing more&#xD;
pleasant?"&#xD;
"Oh, not at all," answered Rose, quite&#xD;
deaf to various significant sounds that were&#xD;
proceeding from the part of the room where&#xD;
her mother sat. "If you don't mind stand-~&#xD;
ing on the pavement, I am sure I don't mind&#xD;
standing here. It's rather entertaining, in&#xD;
fact."&#xD;
"Come out on the balcony, then, won't&#xD;
you? That Undine light is very becoming,&#xD;
but I should like to shake hands, and I can't&#xD;
well manage that across the balcony and.&#xD;
through the blinds."&#xD;
"You will have to dispense with thaV&#xD;
gratification, I fear. I cannot come out on&#xD;
the balcony at this scorching hour of the day&#xD;
-(No, mamma-I have not an idea of going&#xD;
,-and I must say you look very comfortable&#xD;
where you are, Mr. Kennon."&#xD;
"I am very comfortable," said Mr. Ken.&#xD;
non-which in truth was not remarkable, as&#xD;
he was leaning against a large elm, with his&#xD;
face to the window and his back to the tree,&#xD;
thus enjoying at his leisure the shade cast&#xD;
freely down upon him, and the pretty picture&#xD;
arranged before him. "I am very comfort..&#xD;
able indeed; and I will unite usefulness to&#xD;
comfort, by letting you know as soon as the&#xD;
carriage containing your sister-in-law comes.&#xD;
in sight. Does your brother accompany&#xD;
her?"&#xD;
"My brother I" For an instant Rose&#xD;
opened her eyes~ "Oh, you are thinking of&#xD;
my other sister-in-law-my brother Robert's&#xD;
wife. This is the widow of my brother who.&#xD;
is dead-my poor brother Harry. She is&#xD;
travelling alone, and papa has gone down to~&#xD;
the station to meet her. - We have never&#xD;
seen her," proceeded the young lady, waxing'&#xD;
quite confidential. "She and Harry met in&#xD;
Europe, and were married there, and went&#xD;
straight to Brazil, where he had a position as.&#xD;
engineer; and "-her voice fell-" he died&#xD;
there. When his wife came back, she went.&#xD;
to her own friends, and so, though it is three&#xD;
years since she returned, we have never seen&#xD;
her, and-O Mr. Kennon, we do wonder so.&#xD;
much what she is like!"&#xD;
&#xD;
KI&#xD;
&#xD;
"Do you?" said Mr. Kennon. "1 am a&#xD;
little surprised at that. Of course most wom-&#xD;
en have reason to be curious about another&#xD;
woman; but you need not fear a rival near&#xD;
the throne."&#xD;
"I am not sure about that," said Rose,&#xD;
candidly; "Widows are very fascinating;&#xD;
and I think I have heard that she is a&#xD;
beauty."&#xD;
"Her beauty ought to 1e worn off by this&#xD;
time," said Mr. Kennon, with the sneer that&#xD;
often disfigured his handsome mouth. "Can&#xD;
a woman bury husbands ad libiturn, and show&#xD;
no sign of it? If there is one popular be-&#xD;
lief more than another which fills me with&#xD;
disgust, it is the belief that widows have any&#xD;
attraction to men who do not prefer all their&#xD;
goods and chattels second-hand," he went on,&#xD;
with a bitterness which surprised Rose, yet&#xD;
pleased her, too; thoughitwould have waked&#xD;
the suspicion of a more worldly-wise woman.&#xD;
"There is something about a widow that&#xD;
smacks of the charnel-house," he continued.&#xD;
"Either she loved her first husband, or she&#xD;
did not-in either case, who cares to be his&#xD;
successor?"&#xD;
"Then I suppose the I~elle veuve of French&#xD;
comedy has no attraction to you?" said&#xD;
Rose, half archly, half shyly.&#xD;
He laughed-not pleasantly, by any.&#xD;
means.&#xD;
"If ever I make up my mind to marry&#xD;
one," he said, "I shall order my wedding-&#xD;
coat from a pawnbroker's. There would be&#xD;
an exquisite fitness in the association of,,&#xD;
things. But I thjnki see the carriage corn-&#xD;
ing-so your c4~osity with regard to this&#xD;
particular widow will soon be gratified. I&#xD;
hope she will prove every thing she should&#xD;
be, and I hope you will let me come to see&#xD;
you soon.~~&#xD;
He lifted his hat and bowed. But Rose&#xD;
did not return the salutation. She had turned&#xD;
to tell her mother that the expected guest&#xD;
was near at hand; and, when she turned back&#xD;
again, he was already walking rapidly away.&#xD;
She had meant to say something before he&#xD;
went-something that would bring him back&#xD;
soon-but it was too late now. The carriage&#xD;
was approaching, and, even while Mrs. Singles.&#xD;
y was saying, "You might really hav~ some&#xD;
egard for ray wishes, Rose, in the matter of&#xD;
encouragingthat Mr. Kennon," it drew up&#xD;
before the house.&#xD;
The two ladies went out at once to wel-&#xD;
&#xD;
come the stranger. As they reached the&#xD;
front door, they saw Colonel Inglesby assist-&#xD;
ing a tall, graceful woman in a long crape&#xD;
veil, and a long black cloak, from the car-&#xD;
riage. Rose's heart gave a bound. "A&#xD;
beautiful figure, at any rate," she thought;&#xD;
"and still in widow's weeds!" The next&#xD;
moment, there was the rush of reception and&#xD;
greeting-hands clasped, kisses given, half-&#xD;
uttered words spoken~, a few tears shed, per.&#xD;
haps, for this visit coi4d not be other than sad&#xD;
in the thoughts and ass iations which it wak-&#xD;
ened, and, when all t~ft(s subsided, the young&#xD;
widow was within her husband's home.&#xD;
"You would like to go to your own room at&#xD;
once, would you not, my dear?" asked Mrs.&#xD;
Inglesby, as they entered the hail.&#xD;
"Thank you, yes. I am very tired," the&#xD;
stranger answered, in a sweet voice.&#xD;
So she was borne away to the upper re-&#xD;
gions, while Rose-who was intensely curious'&#xD;
to see that veiled face-found herself left to&#xD;
endure her curiosity as best she might.&#xD;
She did not endure it very well. She was&#xD;
impatient and unsettled, and she roamed rest.&#xD;
lesnly about the drawing-room waiting for&#xD;
her mother to return, and quite unconscious&#xD;
that Mrs. Inglesby had come down-stairs and&#xD;
been absorbed into the dining-room, whence&#xD;
proceeded, ever and anon, that friendly clatter&#xD;
of dishes which speaks so confidently f&#xD;
coming cheer. John was a good servant, but&#xD;
rather stupid; so his mistress, who was natu-&#xD;
rally anxious that, on the first day of the&#xD;
stranger's arrival, everything should be right&#xD;
and proper, had thought it best to go and&#xD;
superintend matters in person. Hence, Miss&#xD;
Inglesby fidgeted in the drawing-room quite&#xD;
alone; and hence, 'also, she went to the win-&#xD;
dow and stretched her neck to gaze. up and&#xD;
down the street, in faint hope of seeing Mr.&#xD;
Kennon on the visible horizon. While she was&#xD;
thus engaged, the rustle of a dress sounded&#xD;
behind her, and a melodious voice said:&#xD;
"Have I drifted Into the right room?"&#xD;
and, turning suddenly, she faced h~ sister-in-&#xD;
law.&#xD;
In a moment she saw what she was lil~e,&#xD;
and in a moment, too, her heart, without.&#xD;
rhyme or reason, sank down into her very&#xD;
shoes. "Yes, this is the right room," she&#xD;
said, "and I am very glad to see you. Pray&#xD;
sit down." Meanwhile, she thought, "What&#xD;
a vain fool I was to wonder if she would be&#xD;
prettier than I ~km I" In truth, Mrs. Henry&#xD;

118               MISS INGLESBY'S SISTER-IN-LAW.&#xD;
&#xD;
Inglesby was a woman such as one does not&#xD;
see very often. As eke stood in the soft,&#xD;
golden light, with her graceful figure, her&#xD;
flowing dress of lustrOless black silk, and the&#xD;
folds of sheer white crape at her neck and&#xD;
wrists, she looked so queenly and imposing&#xD;
that pretty, dainty Rose shrank into absolute&#xD;
insignificance before her4 Then, what an ala-&#xD;
baster complexIO~k; what statuesque features;&#xD;
what large, full eyes of the rare golden-brown&#xD;
tint; what rich, heavy masses of magnificent&#xD;
golden-brown hair? Altogether, she was a&#xD;
woman whose beauty ilo one could deny, a&#xD;
woman born to lead hearts captive by right&#xD;
divine of her witching face, and a woman v~ith&#xD;
a fascination quite independent of these per-&#xD;
sonal gifts, as Rose herself was soon forced&#xD;
to acknowledge.&#xD;
For, beginning with soft, ~ad remembrances&#xD;
~f the bright young engineer, who had been&#xD;
the link between them, Mrs. Inglesby soon&#xD;
won her way to the girl's heart. Her man-&#xD;
ners were very ~*eot and graeious-.a little&#xD;
too dignified, perhaps, for the taste of the&#xD;
present day, but '~erj perfect, for all that;&#xD;
and very well oal~ulated to wear away, by&#xD;
gentle degrees, the bsr~lers of shyness and~&#xD;
reae~ve. Thoughthe'dead "Harry" had been&#xD;
only' Rose'S half-brother, she was very tender&#xD;
towardd his memory; and, despite the beauty&#xD;
which at first had startled her, was very well&#xD;
disposed' to like the wife of whom he had been&#xD;
so proud. The two 'Were talking like old ac-&#xD;
quaintances when Cololiel Inglesby came in&#xD;
'aft8r 'awhile-a little shaken from his ordi-&#xD;
nar~y' calm, a little subdued in his ordinary&#xD;
manner; for, "though he had said nothing&#xD;
about it, this visit was a trial to hini, recall-&#xD;
ing, as it did, the son who had been, of all the&#xD;
'children, hi~ favorite and pride. He was re-&#xD;
lieved when he ~aw how matters were pro.&#xD;
greasing, for Rose was an uncertain girl at&#xD;
alltimes~ and in nothing more uncertain than&#xD;
her likes and dislikes4 It had been a matter&#xD;
of doubt how she would receive the new sis-&#xD;
'ter.in-law; and, therefore, her father was re-&#xD;
lieved to see that friendly relations were al-&#xD;
ready established between them. Soon after&#xD;
his entrance Mrs. Inglesby appeared, and,&#xD;
presently, dinner WaS announced&#xD;
The evening which followed, though a&#xD;
strictly domestic, was far from a dull one.&#xD;
The Ingleshy house was, of all houses in Nor.&#xD;
thorpe, the most popular )n &amp;amp; social way;&#xD;
and, though to-night not one of its usual vis-&#xD;
&#xD;
itors rang the door-bell, or dropped in for the&#xD;
"half-minute" that always lengthened into a&#xD;
half-hour, or probably several half-hours, no&#xD;
one missed them, or felt time tedious because&#xD;
of their absence. True, Rose looked once or&#xD;
twice wistfully toward the street, as a mascu-&#xD;
line step rang on the pavement, oi~ a mascu-&#xD;
line voice floated through tl~e window; but&#xD;
she bore the unusua'I isolation very well,&#xD;
and even she acknowledged, when the even-&#xD;
ing was over, that the new sister-ia-law was a&#xD;
singularly charming person. What the latter&#xD;
had said or done that was specially attractive&#xD;
nobody knew; but that whatever she said or&#xD;
did had a grace of it~ own they all felt. .Af-&#xD;
ter she had bidden them good-night, and re-&#xD;
tired to her chamber, they each looked at the&#xD;
chair where she had lately sat, and where the&#xD;
fragrance of her presence still lingered, and&#xD;
each expressed, in different ways, the same&#xD;
degree of admiration.&#xD;
"Poor Harry !-poor fellow!" said the&#xD;
colonel, rising and walking to and fro "It&#xD;
was even harder on him than I thought-to&#xD;
leave all his bright prospects in life, and such&#xD;
a wife, so soon. I have not seen as fine a&#xD;
woman-I don't know when," he went on,&#xD;
quite regardless that his wife and daughter&#xD;
were listening to him. "I hope you will take&#xD;
some lessons from her, Rose. Her manners&#xD;
are perfect."&#xD;
"They are very good, papa," said Rose,&#xD;
with a slight toss of her bead; "but, as for&#xD;
their perfection, that'S all a matter of taste,&#xD;
you know~ Some people might think my&#xD;
manners perfect, and then I should be sorry&#xD;
that I had changed them forthose of my sis-&#xD;
ter-in-law. She is as pretty as she well can&#xD;
~be, however-don't you think so, mamma?&#xD;
Oh,'if I only had such a complexion, and such&#xD;
a nose, and such eyes, and, above all, such a&#xD;
figure, I should be happy-happier than I&#xD;
ever shall be again after seeing them in the&#xD;
possession of another woman, and tbat woman&#xD;
a widow!"&#xD;
"Widows are usually considered very at-&#xD;
tractive," said Mrs. Inglesby, in her quiet&#xD;
way. "I remember, when I was young, I&#xD;
used to be more afraid of them than of girls,&#xD;
a great deal. Alice is so lovely, too-I don't&#xD;
wonder poor Harry used to rave about her.&#xD;
She won't be a widow long-you may depend&#xD;
on that, Rose!"&#xD;
"It don't concern me one way or an-&#xD;
other," said Rose, carelessly. "I like her very&#xD;

&#xD;
much-a great deal better than I expected-&#xD;
and that is all. I believe I'll go to bed. I'm&#xD;
a little sleepy and tired, though I haven't the&#xD;
excuse of a journey, as Mrs. Inglesby had.&#xD;
By-the-way, I must make up my mind before&#xD;
tomorrow what I shall call her. 'Sister' is&#xD;
absurd, and I can't say 'Alice.' She is far&#xD;
too grand-I should much sooner think of&#xD;
saying 'your majesty.'-Good.night, papa. I&#xD;
will practise manners, if you think I need im-&#xD;
provement so badly."&#xD;
The spoiled child kissed her father, bade&#xD;
her mother good.night, and went her way up.&#xD;
stairs. When she entered her chamber, and&#xD;
closed the door, she walked straight to the&#xD;
toilet-table, turned up both jets of the gas,&#xD;
and looked at herself from head to. foot in the&#xD;
larg9( swinging mirror. This careful survey&#xD;
lasted about ten minutes, then a satisfied&#xD;
smile came over her face, and she nodded&#xD;
complacently to the reflection smiling back at&#xD;
her. "You don't lose so much by the com-&#xD;
parison, after all," she said. "And Kennon&#xD;
admires little women-he told me so himself."&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
&#xD;
La belle reuse, as Rose inwardly styled her&#xD;
sister-in.law, made her appearance the next&#xD;
morning in a becoming trifle of a Marie&#xD;
Stuart breakfast-cap, of the sheerest white&#xD;
crape, which gave to her costume the last&#xD;
possible touch of refined elegance. "Why&#xD;
did Providence ever see fit to make such a&#xD;
ravishing creature a widow?" was Miss In-&#xD;
glesby's thought,' as she watched the graceful&#xD;
entrance of the stranger, and exchanged a&#xD;
moderately affectionate greeting with 'her.&#xD;
"Am I early or late?" asked the latter,&#xD;
in her rich, sweet voice-'--the voice of a born&#xD;
contralto. "You did not mention the break-&#xD;
fast-hour last night, and I am always lazy on&#xD;
the least, provocation."&#xD;
"You are early, as it chances," said Rose,&#xD;
watching her with unconscious envy, and al-&#xD;
most wishing herself'a widow, that she might&#xD;
be able to wear such an irresistible coif.&#xD;
"Mamma is not down yet, and breakfast is&#xD;
not ready."&#xD;
"And are you' always so early?" asked&#xD;
Mrs. Inglesby, glancing at a hat and veil near&#xD;
by, which had apparently just been laid aside.&#xD;
"Not always, but I have been a little Un-&#xD;
well this spring, and Dr. Ilawdon advised a&#xD;
&#xD;
walk before breakfast, so I try it occasion-&#xD;
ally. There is a very pleasant square near&#xD;
us, and it is always deserted early in the&#xD;
morning. One might practise gymnastics&#xD;
there with perfect impunity."&#xD;
"Indeed!" said Mrs Inglesby, smiling.&#xD;
"I am rather fond of a constitutional my-&#xD;
self," she went on. "If you have no objec-&#xD;
tion, I think I will join you some morning."&#xD;
"I-of course I shall be very glad," said&#xD;
Rose-but she stammered, and, despite her-&#xD;
self, looked unmistakably dismayed.&#xD;
This expression, qifickly as it was ban-&#xD;
ished, did not escape her sister-in-law. The&#xD;
beautiful brown eyes gave one keen glance&#xD;
which Rose did not soon forget, and then, as&#xD;
a flush came over the delicate guelder-rose&#xD;
complexion of the girl, Mrs. Inglesby walked&#xD;
to one of the low French windows which&#xD;
overlooked a garden blooming with the royal&#xD;
beauty of May.&#xD;
"What beautiful flowers you have!" she&#xD;
said. "I suppose the dew is gone by this&#xD;
time, and one mayventui~e out with impunity?"&#xD;
"Jackson, our gardener, is so careful to&#xD;
keep the walks clear of grass, that you need&#xD;
not fear any amount of dew," said Rose, fol-&#xD;
lowing her, and unclosing the sash.&#xD;
They walked down the garden-paths to-&#xD;
gether; but, while Mrs. Inglesby was de.&#xD;
~lighted with the dewy freshness and fra-&#xD;
grance of every thing around, and while she&#xD;
stopped continually to admire or gather some&#xD;
tempting, bud or half-blown blossom, Rose&#xD;
seemed strangely indifferent to the winsome&#xD;
charm of these bright darlings of the spring.&#xD;
She sauntered listlessly along, and looked so&#xD;
often in the direction of a house' near by-a&#xD;
large, handsome, old-fashioned house, set in&#xD;
a large, old-fashioned garden, Which was di-&#xD;
vided by a high wall from their own-that at&#xD;
last her sister-in-law remarked the fact&#xD;
"Who is your next-door neighbor?" she&#xD;
asked. "Being so .near, you ought to be so-&#xD;
ciable."&#xD;
"We have n~ next-dooi' neighbor," an-&#xD;
swered Rose, a little shortly. "The house is&#xD;
unoooupied."&#xD;
Mrs. Inglesby stopped 'in the act of pull~&#xD;
ing a Noisette bud, and' looked at the house&#xD;
in question. For an unoccupied dwelling it&#xD;
certainly presented a strange appearancejust&#xD;
thea-blinds were open, windows were raised,&#xD;
stir and movement were plainly ~isibIe Within.&#xD;
As she looked, a gentleman showed himself&#xD;

&#xD;
at one of thlopen windows, and then hastily&#xD;
vanished.&#xD;
"If your house is not occupied, it must&#xD;
be haunted," said she, turning to Rose with a&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
But hose was frowning as she-gazed in&#xD;
the same direction, and her companion, whom&#xD;
nothing escaped, saw that one tiny foot was&#xD;
beating nervously on the gravel~path&#xD;
"The new owner must have. come~" an-&#xD;
swered she, almost bitterly. ~ When I said&#xD;
it was not occupiedI sn~ jha~ the old man&#xD;
who used to live 'there is dead, and that his&#xD;
nephew, who inherits the ~p1ace, had not ar-&#xD;
rived."&#xD;
"So it ha~ changeiJihands," said Mrs. In-&#xD;
glesby, looking with considerable interest at&#xD;
the stetely house over which the bright May&#xD;
sunshine slanted as lovingly and gayly as if&#xD;
no coffin hed ever passed across the thresh-&#xD;
ol4 "I think I should hate to leave such a&#xD;
lio~e. What was tha name of the old man&#xD;
of w~hom you speak?"&#xD;
"He was an old wretch," said Rose, yin-&#xD;
dictively, "and his name was Devereur"&#xD;
More than this meagre information Mrs.&#xD;
Inglesby did not receive. As Rose uttered&#xD;
the last word, there came through the open&#xD;
windows the clear, ringing sound of the&#xD;
breakfast-bell, and the two ladies retraced&#xD;
their steps to the house.&#xD;
The day passed very quietly, and so, like-&#xD;
wise, did the evening. But again no visitors&#xD;
dropped in; and it really seemed as if thO&#xD;
curiosity of Northorpe was to be restrained&#xD;
in simply heroic degree. This evening, how-&#xD;
ev~; Rose showed unmistakable signs of&#xD;
enntd. She strolled listlessly to and fro,&#xD;
haunted the neighborhood of the front win-&#xD;
dows, started whenet~ev there was a step on&#xD;
the pavement near the door, and finally com-&#xD;
mittedthe enormIty of anundisguised yawn.&#xD;
Somewhat a~liamed of this last achievement,&#xD;
she went to the piano; but, in the midst of&#xD;
her very first song, there came a Sharp peal&#xD;
of the door-bell that made her start and turn.&#xD;
.A.iioment lati~t John passed through the hail&#xD;
t~ answer the summons, nnd Mrs. Henry In-&#xD;
glesby, who was listening, ~with exemplary&#xD;
pstlenseto h~r mother-in-law's placid stream&#xD;
of small-talk, loOked up with a little Interest&#xD;
in the inter*~sj~tlon. As she looked up, her&#xD;
eye chanced to fall on Rose, and something&#xD;
in the girl'% fa~e attracted her attention.&#xD;
She was listening eagerly-listening with lips&#xD;
&#xD;
parted and color varying-to the sounds at&#xD;
the froji~,4oor; to John fumbling an instant&#xD;
or tw~.t the handle before turning it, and to&#xD;
a v#ee-a round, jovial voice-inquiring if&#xD;
Cqhinel Inglesby and the ladies were at home.&#xD;
,The bright brown eye~ that were watching it&#xD;
saw a swift flush of vexation come over the&#xD;
listening face, and the lips meet only to be&#xD;
impatiently bitten. "Poor child I" thought&#xD;
the elder and more experienced woman, "she&#xD;
is looking for some man who has not&#xD;
come."&#xD;
Somebody had come, however; for, be-&#xD;
sides the voice aforesaid, a hat and stick were&#xD;
audibly deposited in the hall, and a stout old&#xD;
gentleman, in a wig, soon made his appearance&#xD;
at the open door.&#xD;
He was greeted cordially by the colonel&#xD;
as "Brent," and was plainly an intimate friend,&#xD;
from his own greetings to Mrs. Inglesby and&#xD;
Rose.&#xD;
When he was presented to the young&#xD;
stranger, he at once claimed the privilege of&#xD;
shaking bands, on the score of having been&#xD;
a life-long friend of her husband and her hus-&#xD;
band's family,&#xD;
The bustle of reception being over, and&#xD;
all due compliments paid, he sat himself down&#xD;
and plunged at once into social topics, in&#xD;
which Rose alone seemed to take no interest.&#xD;
While he talked at one end of the room, she&#xD;
went on playing at the other, and it was not&#xD;
until the name of Kennon caught her ear that&#xD;
she took her hands from the keys and turned&#xD;
round.&#xD;
"What was that, Mr. Brent?" she asked,&#xD;
quickly. "Did you say that Mr. Kennon has&#xD;
left town?"&#xD;
"I said he intended to leave," said Mr.&#xD;
Brent, while Mrs. Inglesby exchanged a quick&#xD;
glance with her husband. "I met him on the&#xD;
street to-day, and he told me that he was of&#xD;
-to be gone a week, I think he said. But I&#xD;
rather incline to think "-here the old gen-&#xD;
tleman looked very significant-" that he has&#xD;
gone for good."&#xD;
"Why?" demanded Rose, with ill-re-&#xD;
strained eagerness.&#xD;
Mr. Brent glanced round at his audience&#xD;
before he tapped his snuffbox gently, and an-&#xD;
sweked, with a smile, "Because Philip Deve-&#xD;
reux has arrived."&#xD;
T~ say that this item of news made a sen-&#xD;
sation would be to state an extreme fact as&#xD;
mildly as prSsible. Whoever Mr. Philip&#xD;

Devereux might be, it at least was evident&#xD;
that his arrival in Northorpe was a matter ol&#xD;
importance.&#xD;
The colonel said: "Bless my soul! yot&#xD;
don't say so?" Mrs. Inglesby dropped he,&#xD;
crochet-work and said: "Dear me! is it p05&#xD;
sible?" while Rose, turning first red and thea&#xD;
pale, uttered never a word.&#xD;
"Devereux!" said Mrs. Henry Inglesby&#xD;
speaking quietly in the pause which ensued&#xD;
"Is not that the name of the person who lives&#xD;
next door?"&#xD;
"It was the name of the person who lived&#xD;
next door," said Mr. Brent, "and-yes, it is&#xD;
the ni~me of the person who does live next&#xD;
door. Mr. Devereux, the old gentleman-a&#xD;
fine old fellow he was, too-eh, Inglesby ?-&#xD;
is dead; but his nephew, who succeeds to&#xD;
the property, and who, I was just saying, has&#xD;
arrived in Northorpe, is named Devereux&#xD;
also."&#xD;
"It is a good thing that the old name&#xD;
won't die out among us," said Colonel In-&#xD;
glesby, straightening himself back in his&#xD;
chair.&#xD;
"I tiwught I noticed a great commotion&#xD;
of house-cleaning over there to-day," said&#xD;
Mrs Inglesby, in her mild way; "but it&#xD;
really did not occur to me that Philip Deve-&#xD;
reux had arrived.-Dcar me, colonel, you&#xD;
must call on him at once. We were such&#xD;
good friends with old Mr. Devereux; and you&#xD;
remember how he used to come sociably&#xD;
through the garden of an evening to play&#xD;
whist with us?"&#xD;
"I shouldn't be surprised if Mr. Philip&#xD;
Devereux learned to be sociable in the same&#xD;
way-to play something besides whist, per-&#xD;
haps," said Mr. Brent, with a laugh and a&#xD;
glance at Rose, both of which Rose treated&#xD;
with silent disdain.&#xD;
"Odious old wretch !" she thought to&#xD;
herself; but she would not gratify him by&#xD;
deigning to resent the point of his feeble lit-&#xD;
tle joke.&#xD;
"Of course he has come to take posses-&#xD;
sion of the property," said Mrs. Inglesby,&#xD;
after a minute. "But will he-a young man&#xD;
and a bachelor-live in that rambling old&#xD;
house, Mr. Brent?"&#xD;
"He needn't always be a bachelor, you&#xD;
know, my dear madam?' answered Mr. Brent,&#xD;
with another "odious" chuckle. "There'll&#xD;
be caps enough pulled for him among the&#xD;
girls of Northorpe, you may be sure-that is,&#xD;
&#xD;
t if he stays long enough to give them a fair&#xD;
chance."&#xD;
"He may sell the real estate," hazarded&#xD;
the colonel. "Unless he does mean to marry&#xD;
and settle down, such a young man would&#xD;
- scarcely care for that kind of property."&#xD;
"That is more than I can tell you," said&#xD;
Mr. Brent. "Nobody knows-I doubt even if&#xD;
he knows himself-his final intentions about&#xD;
the property. A very fine property," pur.&#xD;
sued he, "and a very fine young man to&#xD;
inherit it. No comparison between him and&#xD;
* a reckless adventurer like Kennon, eh?"&#xD;
Before the colonel could give the assent&#xD;
which was plainly expected, down came a mu-&#xD;
sic-book on the piano-keys with a crash, and&#xD;
Miss Inglesby rose to address the company.&#xD;
"That is the way of the world!" she&#xD;
cried, with a ring of genuine indignation in&#xD;
her voice. "Everybody is always against the&#xD;
unfortunate, and-and always ready to cali&#xD;
them names. I don't suppose that Mr. Ken-&#xD;
non is any more of an adventurer than all&#xD;
poor men are obliged to be; and, if 1w had&#xD;
obtained the fortune, Mr. Brent, you would&#xD;
say of him exactly what you now say of&#xD;
Mr. Devereux!"&#xD;
There was quite a pause after this. No-&#xD;
body answered the impetuous girl. The&#xD;
three old people looked at each other, while&#xD;
~Rose looked at them; and, if anybody had&#xD;
gIan~ced aside at Mrs. Henry Inglesby, he&#xD;
would have seen that she was smiling a&#xD;
peculiar sort of smile to herself as she bent&#xD;
her face down over a photograph-album which&#xD;
she had taken up.&#xD;
It was Mr. Brent who stoke first, indul-&#xD;
gently and kindly, as one might speak to a&#xD;
child.&#xD;
"That's hardly a fair conclusion, Rose,&#xD;
when I say of Kennon only what every-&#xD;
body said long before his grandfather's death,&#xD;
and before the suit about the property was&#xD;
decided. Everybody knows, too, that he baa&#xD;
only himself to thank that his cousin inherits&#xD;
the estate. Mr. Devereux would never have&#xD;
disinherited his gran4son for his nephew if&#xD;
he had not had good reason for it."&#xD;
"His mind was poisoned against Mr..&#xD;
Kennon," said Rose, with the promptness of&#xD;
one who has learned a lesson and knows it&#xD;
by heart.&#xD;
"Nobody who knew him is likely to credit&#xD;
that," answered the old gentleman, with a&#xD;
shrug. "There never was a juster man, or a&#xD;

&#xD;
man less likely to be deceived. It must have&#xD;
gone hard with him when he was obliged to&#xD;
leave the bulk of his fortune away from his&#xD;
own grandson; but I doubt if anybody who&#xD;
knows any thing about Laurence Kennon&#xD;
could blame him."&#xD;
He spoke the last words gravely; then,&#xD;
before Rose could reply, turned to the colonel&#xD;
and proposed a game of whist.&#xD;
"We are four," he said, "even if Mrs.&#xD;
Inglesby "-glancing at the stately young&#xD;
widow.-'-" does not play."&#xD;
As It chanced, however, Mrs. Inglesby. did&#xD;
play, and willingly agreed to take a hand.&#xD;
So the card-table was brought forward,&#xD;
and the quartet sat down-Colonel Inglesby&#xD;
claiming his daughter-in-law as partner, and&#xD;
bidding Rose give them some music as ac-&#xD;
comptnimenL&#xD;
The girl obeyed, playing waltzes, galops,&#xD;
and the like, for some time; but at last the&#xD;
gay strains ceased, and, when her father&#xD;
looked up at the close of a hard-foughtgame,&#xD;
the piano-stool was vacant, and the musician&#xD;
gone,&#xD;
Several days went by, and the tide of&#xD;
Northorpe society flowed in again upon the&#xD;
Inglesby family, receiving, indeed, an unusual&#xD;
impetus from Northorpe curiosity to see the&#xD;
beautiful young widow, concerning whom&#xD;
many good judges of beauty had already be-&#xD;
gun to rave.&#xD;
"How does Rose like a rival so near the&#xD;
throne?" people asked each other, shrugging&#xD;
their shoulders; but as yet nobody could say&#xD;
that Rose showed any signs of uneasiness or&#xD;
jealousy.&#xD;
It was rather providential, from a social&#xD;
point of view, that just in this languid sum-&#xD;
mer weather, two sensations came to Nor-&#xD;
thorpe at the Same time-i. e., Mrs Inglesby&#xD;
and Mr, Devereux.&#xD;
According to the spirit of the gallant&#xD;
French proverb, we have given precedence to&#xD;
the lady; but the popular mind arranged the&#xD;
matter just the other way.&#xD;
During these days Mr. Devereux was the&#xD;
theme of every visitor who came in state, or&#xD;
dropped in sociably at the Inglesby house.&#xD;
"I am sick of his very name," Rose de-&#xD;
clared, passionately; while even her sister-in-&#xD;
law, who said nothing, began to look a little&#xD;
weary when the threadbare subject was again,&#xD;
and yet again, lugged to the front of conver-&#xD;
sation.&#xD;
&#xD;
But Mrs. Inglesby did not weary of it,&#xD;
and seemed to feel as much interest as the&#xD;
rest of Northorpe in penetrating the shell of&#xD;
reserve which, provokingly enough, Mr. Deve-&#xD;
reux had seen fit to draw around himself~ He&#xD;
mingled freely enough with men, but to ladies&#xD;
he was an enigma who deliberately avoided&#xD;
their society.&#xD;
"Very pleasant fellow, indeed, but shy as&#xD;
a girl," was the verdict of all the gentlemen&#xD;
who had called on him and been received&#xD;
with courteous cordiality; but the invitations&#xD;
which society showered upon him had so far&#xD;
been persistently declined. It was of no use&#xD;
at all to worship the rising sun when he ob-&#xD;
stinately refused to let his rays shine upon&#xD;
them.&#xD;
"Laurence Kennon would have done bet-&#xD;
ter than that," people said, indignantly; which&#xD;
was going very far indeed, since, as a general&#xD;
rule, Northorpe held Laurence Kennon in&#xD;
holy horror.&#xD;
At last, however, relief came to the af-&#xD;
flicted community.&#xD;
A certain Mrs. Reynolds, who was the ac-&#xD;
knowledged leader of fashion in Northorpe,&#xD;
returned from a visit of some weeks in a&#xD;
neighboring town, and armounced her inten-&#xD;
tion of storming Mr. Devereux's castle in&#xD;
person.&#xD;
"His mother was a dear friend of mine,~~&#xD;
said this lady-who belonged to that benevo-&#xD;
lent class who have "dear friends" in every&#xD;
direction-" and I mean to bring her son for-&#xD;
ward. It will never do to let him make a&#xD;
hermit of himself like this. Shy men need&#xD;
to be forced into society. I shall give a din-&#xD;
ner next Thursday, and take no denial with re-&#xD;
gard to his appearance.&#xD;
This gratifying intelligence spread like&#xD;
wild-lire through society; and, wh~n the in-&#xD;
vitations to dinner appeared in due form, it&#xD;
threw all dinner-going Northorpe into a twit-&#xD;
ter of excitement, for, knowing their leader,&#xD;
they knew well that the matter-the Devereux~&#xD;
appearance, that is-was an accomplished&#xD;
fact.&#xD;
It was during this momentous time that&#xD;
Mrs. Henry Inglesby (whom, to cut a trouble-&#xD;
some title short, we shall hereafter call Alice}&#xD;
was alone one morning in her room, when&#xD;
there came a slight, hesitating knock at the&#xD;
door. When she said "Come in," the door&#xD;
slowly opened, and her mother-in-law stood&#xD;
on the threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"Excuse me, my dear," she said, hurried-&#xD;
ly, "but here is a note which I brought for&#xD;
you to read. I should not have disturbed you,&#xD;
only it must be answered at once."&#xD;
She came in, and, closing the door behind&#xD;
her, extended an open note. Alice received&#xD;
it, and, glancing over the few lines which it&#xD;
contained, found that it was an invitation to&#xD;
the dinner, from Mrs. Reynolds, who had&#xD;
called on herself the preceding day.&#xD;
"This is for you to decide," she said~ after&#xD;
a minute. "My decision will depend entirely&#xD;
on yours. Do you mean to go?"&#xD;
"My dear, that is exactly what I came to&#xD;
see you about," said Mrs. Inglesby, solemnly,&#xD;
whereupon she sat down and heaved a sigh.&#xD;
"Rose is the best girl in the world," she went&#xD;
on, "but she is very wilful sometimes-so&#xD;
wilful Vbat neither her father nor myself can&#xD;
do any thing with her. You would scarcely&#xD;
believe that, for half an hour, I have been&#xD;
trying to induce her to accept this invitation,&#xD;
and that she absolutely declares she will not&#xD;
do 50 1"&#xD;
She paused after this statement; but&#xD;
Alice's only reply was a slight arch of the&#xD;
eyebrows. She had been long enough in the&#xD;
Inglesby household to find no difficulty what.&#xD;
ever about crediting the assertion.&#xD;
"It is quite true," said Mrs. Inglesby, i~i&#xD;
reply to this little token of attention. "Now,&#xD;
for a particular reason, I am. very anxious&#xD;
that she should accept it, and-and-but, my&#xD;
dear, I may speak to you in confidence, may&#xD;
I not? Well "-when Alice had assured her&#xD;
that she might-" the truth is, that a gentle-&#xD;
man whom I desire very much that she should&#xD;
meet is to be at tbis dinner; and, if she does&#xD;
not go, she will lose the best opportunity of&#xD;
attracting his attention. Other girls will be&#xD;
there, you know; and, though Rose is the&#xD;
belle of Northorpe, still, my dear, there's&#xD;
nothing like being first in the field, especially&#xD;
when a young man is a stranger in a strange&#xD;
place."&#xD;
"I suppose the gentleman is Mr. Deve-&#xD;
reux?" said Alice, who had not listened for&#xD;
nothing to all Northorpe's stream of conver-&#xD;
sation.&#xD;
"Yes, it is Mr. Devereux," said Mrs. In-&#xD;
glesby, blushing a little. "But," she went&#xD;
on, hurriedly, "I must not let you think that&#xD;
it is only because he has inherited a fortune&#xD;
that I want Rose to attract him. He is a&#xD;
young man of whom everybody speaks well,"&#xD;
&#xD;
* said the mother, looking pathetically into the&#xD;
beautiful eyes bent on her. "He is steady&#xD;
and well-principled, and he would make a&#xD;
good husband for Rose; while, oh, my dear,.&#xD;
my heart aches to think she may be led away&#xD;
to marry a man who is none of these things! "&#xD;
"Let us hope not," said Alice, touched by&#xD;
the tone of these last few words. Then her&#xD;
voice grew quiet and indifferent again, as she&#xD;
added: "I suppose you mean that she may&#xD;
be led away to marry Mr. Kennon?"&#xD;
"Yes, I mean that," said Mrs. Inglesby,.&#xD;
too full of her subject to wonder at this&#xD;
knowledge of it in a stranger. "Rose seems.&#xD;
infatuated about him, while he-my dear, I&#xD;
am confident that he is nothing but a fortune-&#xD;
hunter, who, because she is an heiress-my&#xD;
fortune was all settled on her, you know-&#xD;
thinks he will be doing well to marry her."&#xD;
"Some men who are fortune-hunters make&#xD;
tolerably good husbands," said Alice~ in a&#xD;
cold, abstracted way.&#xD;
"But this man is a wretch!" said Mrs.&#xD;
Inglesby, indignantly. "You have no idea&#xD;
what he is. Why, he acted so badly that his.&#xD;
grandfather disinherited him, and left his es-&#xD;
tate to Mr. Devereux. And that man for my&#xD;
Rose! I-I had almost rather see her in her&#xD;
grave."&#xD;
"Think twice about that," said Alice,&#xD;
quietly. "Every thing in the world leaves&#xD;
room for hope, excepting death, you know~&#xD;
I see your difficulty, and I appreciate your&#xD;
confidence. Tell mc how I can help you, and&#xD;
I will do it."&#xD;
In her own way, Mrs. Inglesby told her,&#xD;
and, after a good deal of questioning, Alice&#xD;
arrived at a knowledge of the service she was.&#xD;
requested to render. In brief, it was this-&#xD;
that the invitation of Mrs. Reynolds should&#xD;
be accepted by herself, but that Mrs. Ingles-&#xD;
by should decline going-an attack of rheu-&#xD;
matism from which the colonel was suffering&#xD;
giving her a convenient excuse for remaining&#xD;
at home. In this case, Rose was placed in an&#xD;
awkward dilemma. Either she must be guilty&#xD;
of the rudeness of allowing her sister-in-law&#xD;
to make a first appearance in Northorpe so-&#xD;
ciety quite alone, or she must change her&#xD;
mind and accept the invitation. Alice having&#xD;
given her consent, Mrs. Inglesby went to place&#xD;
the matter before the young insurgent, and&#xD;
soon returned with a submission in due form.&#xD;
The invitation was, therefore, accepted; and,&#xD;
the principal points being settled, all other-&#xD;

&#xD;
issues were allowed to rest until Thursday-&#xD;
the day of the dinner-should arrive.&#xD;
-4--&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
WHEN Thursday at last arrived, it brought&#xD;
quite an assemblage of guests into Mrs. Rey-&#xD;
nolds's drawing-~oom. Northorpe was not&#xD;
only a flourishing place, but lt was also an&#xD;
extremely fashionable place, and, as has been&#xD;
said before, of all the fashion in Northorpe'&#xD;
Mrs. Reynolds was the acknowledged leader.&#xD;
It cannot be saying too much to hazard the&#xD;
assertion that, on the Thursday in question,&#xD;
this lady was a very happy woman. She was&#xD;
not only giving a dinner, such as no one in&#xD;
Northorpe besides herself could give, but she&#xD;
had secured for this dinner the persons of all&#xD;
others concerning whom Northorpe was most&#xD;
full of curious speculation. Then, the beau-&#xD;
tiful Mrs. Inglesby would also make her first&#xD;
appearance in public on this occasion; and,&#xD;
if Mrs. Reynolds had been a euchre-player,&#xD;
she would certainly have said that, if Mr.&#xD;
Devereux was her right bower, Mrs. Inglesby&#xD;
was her left.&#xD;
The gentleman was the first on the field&#xD;
of action, and was made warmly welcome by&#xD;
Mrs. Reynolds. When he was presented to&#xD;
the assembled guests, they all expressed their&#xD;
pleasure in extremely flattering terms; but&#xD;
they all acknowledged to themselves that Mr.&#xD;
Devereux was by no means so distinguished&#xD;
in appearance as they had been induced to&#xD;
expect-why, it is hard to say-that he would&#xD;
be. It is true that he was tall, and that he&#xD;
had a well-built figure-two trump-cards in&#xD;
the popular estimation of good looks-but his&#xD;
manners werQ reserved in the extreme, and&#xD;
his face was of that excessive fairness which,&#xD;
blotting out all tints, leaves only the beauty&#xD;
of feature and expression. In this ease, the&#xD;
features were very indifferent, and the ex-&#xD;
pression, like the manner, very reserved. A&#xD;
physiognomist, looking at the face, might&#xD;
have seen that it would light up well, that the&#xD;
gray eyes would grow luminous under ex-&#xD;
citement, and the quiet mouth break into&#xD;
pleasant smiles. But people in general&#xD;
thought the countenance dull as "well as&#xD;
plain; and, if its owner had not been a per-&#xD;
son of importance, would not have hesitated&#xD;
-to express this opinion. Hp gave them good&#xD;
.opportunity t~scrutinize his appearance; for,&#xD;
&#xD;
instead of devoting himself to the entertain.&#xD;
ment of some of the ladies who were moment-&#xD;
ly growing more numerous, he kept his place&#xD;
by Mrs. Reynolds's chair, leaning against one&#xD;
corner of the mantel, eying the gay company&#xD;
with the gaze of a contemplative recluse, and&#xD;
looking, as more than one young lady de-&#xD;
clared, "the very picture of a diffident man."&#xD;
Suddenly, however, there arose a diversion&#xD;
-suddenly, for a moment, even Mr. Devereux&#xD;
was forgotten. At the door there was a Stir,&#xD;
in the room there fell a pause, and while&#xD;
everybody was gazing eagerly around, Rose&#xD;
Inglesby and her stately sister-in-law swept&#xD;
up the long drawing-room.&#xD;
Mrs. Reynolds met them half-way with&#xD;
great empres8ement, and, while her greetings&#xD;
were made, a whisper of irrepressible ad-&#xD;
miration was passing from group to group.&#xD;
"Is she hot superb?" "how dazzling she&#xD;
looks to-night!" "77~atis my idea of a beau-&#xD;
tiful woman!,' "What graceful manners!"&#xD;
etc., etc.-men and women rivaling each&#xD;
other in open, honest praise. For once, no-&#xD;
body even noticed Rose. Pretty as she was&#xD;
looking, charmingly as she was dressed, the&#xD;
belle of Northorpe obtained scarcely a glance&#xD;
in the scene of her own triumphs and in&#xD;
the midst of her own vassals. No eye left&#xD;
Mrs. Inglesby to dwell on the dainty, blue-&#xD;
robed girl beside her. "Rose looks very nice-&#xD;
ly," was all that people said; and they only&#xD;
said that after time, with a start of recollec-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
If Mr. Devereux made only a questionable&#xD;
success, Mrs. Inglesby created a sensation.&#xD;
Mrs.. Reynolds iVas fairly besieged for intro.&#xD;
ductions; and before long the young widow's&#xD;
gracious manners had completed what her&#xD;
beauty had begun. Every woman in the&#xD;
room was charmed, and every man was at her&#xD;
feet. The finishing touch to this success was&#xD;
given when the duty of taking her in to din-&#xD;
ner devolved on Mr. Devereux; and, having&#xD;
thus safely paired off her lions, Mrs. Reynolds&#xD;
felt the ease and repose of a well-satisfied&#xD;
conscience.&#xD;
At first Alice fell into the common error&#xD;
of taking Mr. Devereux's quietness for stu-&#xD;
pidity, and pitching the tone of her conversa-&#xD;
tion accordingly. But she was too clever a&#xD;
woman not to learn better than this from his&#xD;
first remark, and in a few minutes she had&#xD;
drawn him out sufficiently to see that his re-&#xD;
serve was not unconquerable, nor his quiet.&#xD;
&#xD;
ness of that troublesome kind which degen-&#xD;
erates into heaviness. He was a cultivated&#xD;
man himself~ but it had been his misfortune&#xD;
to know very little of the society of cultivated&#xD;
people; so, a. woman who was young and&#xD;
beautiful, with sense enough to meet him on&#xD;
his own ground, and lightness enough to lend&#xD;
grace to the dullest themes, was a phenome-&#xD;
non to which he bowed at once. Before din-&#xD;
ner was over, Rose saw how matters were&#xD;
drifting. And, though she had angrily re-&#xD;
pelled the idea of attracting Mr. Devereux,&#xD;
and had even gone so far as to declare that&#xD;
she would have nothing whatevein~ to say to&#xD;
him, she felt a throb of genuine disappoint-&#xD;
ment that she was not to have the opportunity&#xD;
of showing that she did not care for the at-&#xD;
tentions of this desirable cavalier.&#xD;
l3ef4re the evening was over, everybody&#xD;
saw that Mr. Devereux was quite captivated&#xD;
by the beautiful widow. He did not abso-&#xD;
lutely spend the whole time at her side; but,&#xD;
whenever he was with anybody else, he re-&#xD;
lapsed into his usual reserve and silence,&#xD;
proving such a very unsatisfactory companion&#xD;
that several young ladies were reduced to the&#xD;
verge of despair by a total exhaustion of their&#xD;
conversational ideas. It was only when he&#xD;
was again under the influence of Mrs. Ingles-&#xD;
by, that he revived and became once more a&#xD;
genial and pleasant companion. Of course&#xD;
there was but one explanation for a state of&#xD;
affairs like this; and that explanation the&#xD;
company in Mrs. Reynolds's drawing-room&#xD;
were not slow to give. "Your handsome&#xD;
sister-in-law has accomplished what all the&#xD;
young ladies in Northorpe promised the~-~&#xD;
selves the pleasure of doing," said an&#xD;
lady to Rose; and Rose made the most fooIl~&#xD;
ish speech in the world when she answered:&#xD;
"1 beg you will make one exception when you&#xD;
speak of the young ladies of Northorpe, Mrs.&#xD;
Holmes. Ihave neither promised myself the&#xD;
pleasure, nor felt any desire to attract Mr.&#xD;
Devereux." "Oh, my dear, you can't sup.&#xD;
pose that I was thinking of you," said Mrs.&#xD;
Holmes, apologetically. And in truth she&#xD;
had ~ot been thinking of Rose at all, know-&#xD;
ing that she wa~ an heiress, and therefore&#xD;
quite able to please herself in a matrimonial&#xD;
way. But, after this speech, her eyes were&#xD;
suddenly opened. Soon everybody in the&#xD;
room knew that "Rose Inglesby was ready&#xD;
to bite off her sister-in-law's head because she&#xD;
had secured Mr. Devereux."&#xD;
&#xD;
Great was Mrs. Inglesby's dismay when&#xD;
she heard how matters had gone on that&#xD;
momentous evening. Too late she recognized&#xD;
her own folly, too late she felt that she would&#xD;
have given any thing to undo her own work.&#xD;
It is the highest compliment to the good&#xD;
lady's simplicity to say that such a fear as&#xD;
this had never entered her head. Rose, in&#xD;
her eyes, was invincible, and she had boldly&#xD;
thrown Rose in juxtaposition with a woman&#xD;
whom any ordinary mother would have avoi&amp;amp;-&#xD;
ed as men avoid the plague-a woman of&#xD;
beauty so remarkable, of attractions so great,&#xD;
that no girl could safely have encountered&#xD;
her as a rival. When Rose made her mali-&#xD;
cious report of how the fortunes of the night&#xD;
had gone, Mrs. Inglesby could freely have&#xD;
choked herself~, if choking herself would at&#xD;
all have mended matters. But, as that was&#xD;
out of the question, she could only think,&#xD;
"Perhaps he will change his mind when he&#xD;
sees Rose by daylight."&#xD;
The fallacy of this hope was soon demon-&#xD;
strated. Two days later, Mr. Devereux called&#xD;
-supported by the liberal aid and counte-&#xD;
nance of Mrs. Reynolds-saw Rose by day-&#xD;
light, and barely said six commonplace, civil&#xD;
words to her. It is impossible to be very&#xD;
devoted in the course of a ceremonious morn-&#xD;
hig call; but, as much as was possible, he de-&#xD;
voted himself to Alice. His eyes followed&#xD;
her, his whole attention was engrossed by&#xD;
her; and, when he left, Mrs. Inglesby was&#xD;
justified in her despairing thought-" It is&#xD;
all over. That dreadful Kennon is inevita-&#xD;
ble."&#xD;
A week passed; another week followed,&#xD;
and still the dreadful Kennon had not made&#xD;
hj~ appearance. Some people smiled, and&#xD;
Aid he would not come back at all, that he&#xD;
~ad no desire to see his cousin basking in&#xD;
the prosperity which might have been his&#xD;
own, and that he had quietly taken himself&#xD;
off the scene. Others tl\ught differently;&#xD;
and among the latter was Miss Inglesby.&#xD;
Rose kept her opinion to herself; but, in her&#xD;
own mind, she was firmly persuaded that&#xD;
Kennon would return. That fund of vanity,&#xD;
which often stands a woman in good stead,&#xD;
assured her that he would come back, if only&#xD;
for the farewell that had not been said, for&#xD;
the last words that had not been spoken.&#xD;
"He might leave Northorpe in this ungra-&#xD;
cious way, but he never would leave me," she&#xD;
thought, considering the while what a pleas-&#xD;

&#xD;
'sire it would be to show him that she at least&#xD;
*did not court Mr. Devereux's society, nor de-&#xD;
sire his attentions. True, it would be several&#xD;
degrees better if she could show him that&#xD;
these attentions had been at her command,&#xD;
and that she had declined them; but, since&#xD;
this was impossible, she was fain to console&#xD;
herself with the thought that it was at least&#xD;
the more dignified position never to have re-&#xD;
ceived them--never, as she flattered herself,&#xD;
to have appeared conscious of MrDevereux's&#xD;
existence.&#xD;
'This. dignified pose, however, became&#xD;
rather trying and awkward, as time went on,&#xD;
tind, the ice having once been broken, Mr.&#xD;
Devereux found his way very frequently into&#xD;
the Inglesby circle. At first he came like&#xD;
every other visitor, in orthodox and formal&#xD;
fashion, through the front-door; but before&#xD;
long he discovered that a short cut through&#xD;
'the garden was much more convenient, and&#xD;
that it was very pleasant indeed to drop into a&#xD;
sort of ami de la maisots place in the bowery&#xD;
drawing-room, full of the scent of roses, the&#xD;
graceful presence of women, music now and&#xD;
then, bright smiles and social ease always.&#xD;
Despite her bitter disappointment, Mrs. In-&#xD;
glesby could not help liking the young nian.&#xD;
He was so quiet, so unobtrusive, so thorough-&#xD;
'ly refined, so genial, when he once fairly&#xD;
thawed. "Oh, if he would only fall in love&#xD;
with Rose!" she said to her husband. But,&#xD;
provokingly enough, the colonel seemed cx-&#xD;
~cellently well satisfied with matters as they&#xD;
were.&#xD;
"lie's a trifle too grave and dignified for&#xD;
a butterfly like Rose," he said. "I think he&#xD;
shows his sense and his taste in choosing&#xD;
Alice. She's a grand creature, and, by&#xD;
George! any man might be proud to win her.&#xD;
1~here is nothing I should like better than to&#xD;
'see her settled with us for life-just over the&#xD;
-way, in that fine old Devereux house, too!"&#xD;
"The house where I have always hoped&#xD;
'to see Rose!" said Mrs. Inglesby, in a tone&#xD;
of exasperation.               /&#xD;
It was trying to the poor woman, beyond&#xD;
doubt-.4--and the more trying because she had&#xD;
130 sympathy from anybody, unless, indeed&#xD;
(as she often imagined), there was sympathy&#xD;
in Alice's large, golden-brown eyes. Mr.&#xD;
Devereux's devotion to the fair, young wid-&#xD;
ow tiecame, in a short time, exceedingly&#xD;
nianifest, but it was impossible for the most&#xD;
hearing tongue in Northorpe to say that she&#xD;
&#xD;
"encouraged" him. Neither did she repel his&#xD;
attentions. The gentle stateliness, the ab-&#xD;
solutely perfect courtesy of her manner, was&#xD;
the same to him as to every one else-a trifle&#xD;
warmer, perhaps, because of the familiar po-&#xD;
sition which he had gained, and also because&#xD;
she liked him sincerely.&#xD;
Rose, on her part, could not help feeling a&#xD;
little sore about the unconscious yet most&#xD;
successful rivalry of her sister-in-law. Every-&#xD;
body in Northorpe was raving over "that&#xD;
beautiful Mrs. Inglesby," and Rose would not&#xD;
have 'been human if she had not felt that it&#xD;
was a little hard. Her own friends, her own&#xD;
admirers, her own vassals, were offering their&#xD;
incense at another shrine before her very&#xD;
face. "I can't see why a woman should not&#xD;
be satisfied with having had one husband !"&#xD;
thought the girl, resentfully, as she watched&#xD;
some of these scenes of homage. "Ithink&#xD;
widows ought to shut themselves up in con-&#xD;
vents, or spend their lives doing good to the&#xD;
poor, instead of looking ravishingly lovely in&#xD;
black silk and white crape, and Marie-Stuart&#xD;
caps, to-to turn silly people's heads!"&#xD;
It was a matter of satisfaction during this&#xD;
time that Kennon did not swell the number&#xD;
of these silly people. Often when Rose was&#xD;
worn out with the manner in which every-&#xD;
body chanted the praises of her sister-in-law,&#xD;
there was a very great and sensible satisfac-&#xD;
tion in recalling those bitter words concern-&#xD;
ing widows which Kennon had spoken when&#xD;
she saw him last. As was said at the time,&#xD;
the girl was not enough of a woman of the&#xD;
world to suspect what might underlie this&#xD;
bitterness. She only smiled to herself as she&#xD;
thought there was no fear that he would ever&#xD;
swell the new beauty's train! She might en-&#xD;
snare the rich cousin, but the poor one could&#xD;
be trusted to withstand her fascinations.&#xD;
It was about this time that Mr. Devereux&#xD;
came to Mrs. Inglesby one day and asked if&#xD;
she would be kind enough to do the honors&#xD;
of an entertainment which he had thoughts&#xD;
of giving. "It is not a pleasant thing to do,"&#xD;
he said; "but I have been very hospitably&#xD;
received in Northorpe, and a return is only&#xD;
courteous. Besides, since I intend to live&#xD;
here, I-perhaps I should begin to cultivate&#xD;
society a little." Mrs. Inglesby agreed that&#xD;
this was entirely right, aiid, smothering a&#xD;
sigh, asked what kind of 'entertainment he&#xD;
wished to give.&#xD;
"I leave all that to you," said he, looking&#xD;
&#xD;
a little puzzled; "but I thought of a dinner,&#xD;
and a-a dance, perhaps, in the evening."&#xD;
"That is just the thing," said Mrs. Ingles.&#xD;
by; "but you must not ask me to do the&#xD;
honors of the occasion. You must go to Mrs.&#xD;
Reynolds. She would be mortally offended&#xD;
if you did not ask her; nnd she has so much&#xD;
taste that, if you give her carte blanche, she&#xD;
will arrange something very charming for&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"But I would rather you managed the af-&#xD;
fair," said the young man, simply.&#xD;
She shook her head, laughing.&#xD;
"I have *oo much regard for your inter.&#xD;
est to do it," she said. ~' I could arrange&#xD;
the dcunestic part of your entertainment-&#xD;
and I will give you any assistance in my&#xD;
power T but, for the social part, you need&#xD;
somebody like Mrs. Reynolds."&#xD;
"Won't you plead for me I"' said he,&#xD;
turning to Alice and Rose. "Mrs. Reynolds&#xD;
will simply extinguish me."&#xD;
But he found that there was no appeal.&#xD;
Everybody decided against him, and said that&#xD;
Mrs. Reynolds was the only person for the&#xD;
occasion; so, he was forced to submit, and,&#xD;
with what grace he could muster, go and lay&#xD;
his petition before that ~oeial sovereign.&#xD;
It Was very graciously received and&#xD;
granted. All was grist, in the social ways&#xD;
that came to Mrs. Reynolds's mill; and soon&#xD;
Northorpe rang with the anticipatedf~te, and&#xD;
the splendor of the preparations which were&#xD;
in progress at the Devereux house. For the&#xD;
space of an entire fortnight every thing with-&#xD;
in the staid old mansion was turned upside&#xD;
down in the most complete and exnsperati~&#xD;
manner. Sounds of hammering resounded&#xD;
all over the neighborhood. Curtains, car-&#xD;
pets, furniture, allwere renovated and changed.&#xD;
Having obtained entrance into the house,&#xD;
Mrs. Reynolds found it delightful to give her&#xD;
taste (which was certainly excellent, though&#xD;
rather extravagant) full rein for once. Par-&#xD;
titions were knocked down, and partitions&#xD;
were put up -the quiet old looms scarcely&#xD;
knew themselves in their bright, new guise.&#xD;
As for Devereux, having called down the&#xD;
infliction upon his own head, he felt that&#xD;
there was lie hope of redress, no refuge but&#xD;
submission. He might, however, have igno-&#xD;
miniously fled, or ended his existence with&#xD;
prussic acid, if he had not possessed the&#xD;
quiet retreat of the Inglesby house, and the&#xD;
Inglesby garden. But, coming over in the&#xD;
&#xD;
dewy softness of the summer evening, and&#xD;
pacing by Alice's side up and down the green&#xD;
paths, with the fragrant roses blooming all'&#xD;
around, the stars faintly gleaming into sight,&#xD;
and a mocking -bird singing a sweet love-&#xD;
song in the jasmine-hedge, he could almost,&#xD;
forget his troubles, he could regard carpen-&#xD;
ters and upholsterers without enmity, he&#xD;
could even cover with the mantle of Chris-&#xD;
tian charity the whole race of "society.lead.&#xD;
ers."&#xD;
When' at last the day of trial came, he&#xD;
girded himself up like a soldier going to&#xD;
battle, and really acquitted himself so well&#xD;
that he surprised everybody.( Alice, in espe-&#xD;
cial, was charmed with his bearing-its quiet&#xD;
dignity and graceful courtesy.&#xD;
"You don't know what credit you have&#xD;
done yourself," she said to him with a smile,&#xD;
when he came to her after dinner.&#xD;
"You don't know what agonies of shyness&#xD;
I have endured," he answered.&#xD;
"And conquered," she added, with a&#xD;
glance of approbation that would have repaid&#xD;
him for any thing.&#xD;
"You arc very good to say so," he replied,&#xD;
gratefully. "But, since duty is over, pleasure&#xD;
ought to follow. Will you let me name my&#xD;
reward, and-give it to me?"&#xD;
"You are at liberty to name it, of course;&#xD;
but how can I give it to you?"&#xD;
She looked at him so kindly as she ut-&#xD;
tered the last words, that he did not lapse&#xD;
into the diffidence with which a cold or a&#xD;
flippant reply would assuredly have over-&#xD;
whelmed him.&#xD;
"I have a friend who is an artist at Dus-&#xD;
seldorf," he said, "and by my request he sent&#xD;
me several paintings, which I have received&#xD;
within the last few days. They all have&#xD;
great merit; but one, in especial, I should&#xD;
like to show you. It is an exquisite bit of&#xD;
Thuringian landscape. I have hung it in the&#xD;
library for the present. If you would come&#xD;
and let me show it to you-"&#xD;
~"So it is a pleasure you mean to give&#xD;
me," she said. "I thought U was to be the&#xD;
other way. But, of course, I shall be very&#xD;
glad to come.&#xD;
By special stipulation, the library had not&#xD;
been included in the transformation wbich&#xD;
the rest of the house had undergone. About&#xD;
it, therefore, still hung the mellow aroma of&#xD;
age. It looked very inviting when they e'?l~&#xD;
tered-with its books and pictures, and white&#xD;

&#xD;
busts gleaming in the shaded lamplight.&#xD;
The windows were all set wide open to the&#xD;
soft summer night, while the fragrance of&#xD;
roses, jasmine, and honeysuckle, was wafted&#xD;
in on the night breeze, and seemed to fill&#xD;
every corner of the room.&#xD;
Removing the shade from one of the lamps,&#xD;
Devereux held it up so that she could see&#xD;
the picture of which he had spoken. She&#xD;
had no special repossession toward art, but&#xD;
her culture had been too thorough for her&#xD;
not to cordially recognize and fully appreciate&#xD;
excellence in this respect. She praised the&#xD;
picture-which was truly worth praising-as&#xD;
much as he could possibly have desired.&#xD;
Then she began to look about the room.&#xD;
Some of its old family portraits elicited her&#xD;
admiration-in the very old time, family por-&#xD;
traits were not alwa~,'s daubs-and then she&#xD;
began to examine various French and German&#xD;
engravings hung here and there in nooks and&#xD;
corners.&#xD;
"So this is where you write!" said she,&#xD;
pausing before a table upon which signs of&#xD;
literary occupation were to be seen. "What&#xD;
a pleasant place for authorship-at leisure!&#xD;
You ought to be a poet, Mr. Devereux, sit-&#xD;
ting in this charming old library, with a&#xD;
rose-garden under your window, and a view&#xD;
of lovely scenery beyond! But what is this&#xD;
hanging over your table?"&#xD;
"Only an engraving I found among my&#xD;
things the other day," answered he. "I&#xD;
hung it here because I thought-or I fancied&#xD;
-that the feminine figure resembled your-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
"Indeed!" said she, smiling. "In that&#xD;
case, I must see it more closely."&#xD;
He held the light for her, and she saw&#xD;
that it was a scene such as some of the mi-&#xD;
nor English artists are rather fond of paint.&#xD;
ing. Even in the engraving, it showed con-&#xD;
siderable art and skill. A fair, stately woman&#xD;
dressed in widow's weeds-a woman whose&#xD;
general appearance was so like her own that&#xD;
the resemblance was patent even to herself-&#xD;
stood in a church-yard by a large white mar-&#xD;
ble cross that marked the head of a freshly-&#xD;
made grave. It was evident that she had&#xD;
just arisen from her knees, for the grass was&#xD;
bent down all around her, but the proud, ex-&#xD;
pressive dignity of her attitude was match-&#xD;
less, though there was a certain pathos on&#xD;
the lines of the steadfast fae. A strong con-&#xD;
trast was made by the figure at tha other end&#xD;
&#xD;
of the grave-a slender, handsome man, who&#xD;
stood with folded arms fixing on her a glance&#xD;
of fierce passion and fierce disdain. The&#xD;
background of the picture framed these fig-&#xD;
ures admirably. There were green yews&#xD;
drooping over an old Gothic church, quiet&#xD;
graves and crosses hung with wreaths of un-&#xD;
mortelles.&#xD;
"It is a good picture, and, I should think,&#xD;
well painted," said Alice, at last; "but I&#xD;
don't like the subject. There is something&#xD;
repulsive about a love-scene in a grave-&#xD;
yard."&#xD;
"Do you call tAct a love-scene?" asked&#xD;
Devereux, in surprise. "I should call it any&#xD;
thing else. It is evident that he is an old&#xD;
lover whom the lady had forgotten or re-&#xD;
jected; but it is also evident that he has&#xD;
come not to sue, but to upbraid. See, how-&#xD;
ever, the magnificent repose and dignity of&#xD;
her whole face and manner! That is what&#xD;
reminds me so much of you."&#xD;
"You flatter me," she said, smiling. But&#xD;
she moved away from the picture, as if she&#xD;
did not like to look at it.&#xD;
"Take my advice," she said, after a min-&#xD;
ute. "Hang this exquisite head of St. John&#xD;
over your writing-table, instead of that scene&#xD;
which leaves one in doubt who was right or&#xD;
who was wrong, and gives no clew to the re-&#xD;
sult of the dramatic situation."&#xD;
"Uncertainty is not always the worst&#xD;
evil," said he, half sadly. "There are ninny&#xD;
others much worse. Sometimes certainty is&#xD;
one of them."&#xD;
She answered nothing, but moved ona&#xD;
little farther, and paused before one of the&#xD;
open windows, gazing out on the fragrant&#xD;
stillness of the summer night. She looked&#xD;
like a fair dream-lady in her sweeping white&#xD;
dress, yet her pulses were beating very&#xD;
quickly, and the atmosphere about her&#xD;
seemed full of a certain thrill She knew&#xD;
that a word - nay, a glance-would bring&#xD;
upon her the issue which she had fully ex-&#xD;
pected to meet that night. But, somehow,&#xD;
this picture had unnerved her, and she could&#xD;
not resolve to meet it. Old memories came&#xD;
back with strange force. Something in the&#xD;
dark, scornful face of the man at the foot of&#xD;
the grave-something of expression, not of&#xD;
feature-had wakened much which she had&#xD;
thought long since dead. For once her usual&#xD;
stately self-control did not come at her call.&#xD;
Devereux, for his part, felt chilled by her&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
MISS INGLESB3&#xD;
&#xD;
sudden silence and reserve. His heart san&#xD;
-he feared more than he hoped. He hes,&#xD;
tated-doubted-asked himself if he had nc&#xD;
better wait.&#xD;
They were still standing apart in this wa&#xD;
when a whist-quartet came in, and the oppoi&#xD;
unity was lost.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
"Ir there is a bore in this world great'&#xD;
than the bore of going to see 'views,' I don'&#xD;
know what it is!', said Rose Inglesby, a~&#xD;
she sat at the breakfast-table in her riding&#xD;
habit, eating her muffins and drinking hei&#xD;
coffee with the air of a martyr. "I hat&#xD;
scenery!" the young heretic went on vi&#xD;
ciously~ "and of all kinds of scenery I thinly&#xD;
I hate cascades most. There is no end tc&#xD;
the shoes I have worn out over those abonui&#xD;
nable rocks-you need not laugh, papa! You&#xD;
really haven't an idea what it is to be made a&#xD;
victim in this way."&#xD;
"My dear child, why don't you stay at&#xD;
home, then?" asked Mrs. Inglesby, mild-&#xD;
ly.. "That is just like you, mamma,"' said her&#xD;
daughter, hopelessly. "If I did stay at home,&#xD;
you would be the first to say that it was&#xD;
awfully uncivil to let Alice go alone, espe-&#xD;
cially since the party was made up for her.&#xD;
I fancy she is nearly as much bored as I am,&#xD;
only she takes good care not to say so."&#xD;
"It isn't everybody who is as blind to the&#xD;
beauties of Nature as you are, Rosie," said&#xD;
her father. "I've do doubt Alice will enjoy&#xD;
the cascade very much."&#xD;
"Well, perhaps she may," returned Rose&#xD;
the skepti~.al. "I forget that she is going in&#xD;
Mr. Devereux's new dog-cart, with Mr. Deve-&#xD;
reux himself to talk 'the sublime, the heroic,&#xD;
and Mr. Carlyle,' all the way. These things&#xD;
may season the cascade for ~her. Not pos-&#xD;
sessing them, they naturally don't season it&#xD;
for me."&#xD;
"Mr. Anson is very pleasant, Rose," said&#xD;
Mrs. Inglesby, in deprecating support of the&#xD;
gentleman who was to have the honor of&#xD;
riding at Miss Inglesby's bridle-rein.&#xD;
"He was pleasant six months back," said&#xD;
Rose, coolly; "but I exhausted him long ago&#xD;
-most men are not good for more than three&#xD;
months-and he tires me to death now. Oh&#xD;
dear!"&#xD;
9&#xD;
&#xD;
~'S SISTER-IN-LAW.                     129&#xD;
k This apparently rather irrelevant sigh was&#xD;
I. addressed to the memory of Kennon. "It' As&#xD;
t were only here!" Rose thought. In that case&#xD;
it is probable that her martyr excursion would&#xD;
y have worn a very different seeming.&#xD;
Mrs. henry Inglesby entered just here,&#xD;
and her appearance ended the conversation.&#xD;
She was dressed in driving-costume, and dis-&#xD;
played a pair of wonderfully strong boots for&#xD;
the colonel's admiration.&#xD;
"They have told me so many frightful&#xD;
r things about the rocks," she said, "that I&#xD;
t have shod myself as if for an Alpine ascent.&#xD;
I am afraid I am late. Rose, isn't it nearly&#xD;
- time to start?"&#xD;
"Indeed, I don't know," said Rose. "I&#xD;
only wish I had been there and was safely&#xD;
- back again.&#xD;
It may be well to premise that the excur-&#xD;
sion which Miss Inglesby regarded with so&#xD;
* much discontent was one that no stranger&#xD;
visiting Northorpe was ever Buffered to neg-&#xD;
lect-to wit, a visit to a certain famous cas-&#xD;
cade near the town. On the present occasion&#xD;
the excursion was to take the form of that&#xD;
most tiresome of all social amusemepts-a&#xD;
picnic. At the Devereux entertainn-~ent the&#xD;
plan had been mooted. Mrs. Reyt!olds, who&#xD;
was the most obliging of social purveyors,&#xD;
paid at once that she would cli.aperon any&#xD;
party desirous of visiting the's falls; and a&#xD;
party was forthwith arranged. Of course, Mr.&#xD;
Devereux placed his equipa'e at Mrs. Ingles-&#xD;
by's command; and whe~, this attention was&#xD;
gracefully accepted, Nrirthorpe, of course,&#xD;
nodded its head niore' sagely than ever, and&#xD;
said, "What a suital',le match it will be!"&#xD;
It is one thing to drive with a man, how-&#xD;
ever, and quite wKlother to marry him. Mrs.&#xD;
Inglesby found 'the first very pleasant as she&#xD;
bowled along in the early freshness of the&#xD;
bright, sumlrAer morning; but perhaps it ;5~q&#xD;
because sb'8 had not quite made up her mind&#xD;
with regard to the second that she kept the&#xD;
converse ation steadily on the smooth ground&#xD;
of o9iinary subjects. Those topics which&#xD;
Roe',, included under the general, or father&#xD;
vague, head of "the sublime, the heroic, and&#xD;
YLr. Carlyle," served very well for the five or&#xD;
six miles of moderately good road traversed&#xD;
before they reached their destination.&#xD;
"I believe we must alight here," said Mr.&#xD;
Devereux, drawing up his horses on the sum-&#xD;
mit of a hill, where the road they had been&#xD;
following suddenly came to an end in the&#xD;

&#xD;
midst of some woods. "You see the eques-&#xD;
trians have dismounted," he went on, pointing&#xD;
to several horses -fhstencd under the trees,&#xD;
"and the best thing we can do is to follow&#xD;
their example. Now"-after they had alighted&#xD;
"shall we make the descent?"&#xD;
"Had we not better wait for Mrs. Rey-&#xD;
nolds?" said Alice, who felt indolent and&#xD;
ready to stay where she was, at least for atime.&#xD;
"The others have not waited for us," said&#xD;
her companion, in reply to this; "and it is a&#xD;
case of every man for himself in the matter&#xD;
of descent. Mrs. Reynolds has three or four&#xD;
people with her; but, if even she were alone,&#xD;
I am sure I could not render assistance to&#xD;
any one beside yourself."&#xD;
"Wait and see if I need it," said Alice,&#xD;
smiling. "I am trained in the matter of&#xD;
mountain-climbing--and the only time I ever&#xD;
absolutely needed help was in ascending Mont&#xD;
Blanc. That was terrible! Is this the way&#xD;
we go? Then lead on, and let me see if I&#xD;
~s~annot dispense with the assistance of which&#xD;
~u speak."&#xD;
~' You surely will not be so unkind as to de-&#xD;
.~piive ,ine of the pleas!lre of rendering it," said&#xD;
he, ~wfiti~ a great deal of seriousness in his&#xD;
4eyes,~&amp;amp;esp~itc the jest in his voice.&#xD;
"'I will make no rash resolutions," she&#xD;
;~answered. '"Lead~n, and let me see."&#xD;
Without another word, he obeyed, leading&#xD;
~4he way along a ~narrow path, and, after a mo-&#xD;
nient, down an ~jjmost precipitate hill-side.&#xD;
'The way was very ~\)nding, so winding that it&#xD;
was hardly possible ~ ~ see more than a step&#xD;
in advance, and Alice ~ on found herself slip.&#xD;
ping and sliding from oLe steep rock to an-&#xD;
other, with the least possi~\~le amount of per-&#xD;
sonal ~volitiiui, and the lea~Ot possible idea&#xD;
~where '~imwas going next. j~, 'fore very long,&#xD;
~~he (eame to a halt.&#xD;
~L U~ink yo~z will have to hAP me over&#xD;
this place, Mr. De'resunx," she said~ in a hesi-&#xD;
tating voice.&#xD;
And Mr. DevereuX~whO had been li,.~tening&#xD;
with painful intensity f~r this sound, tvrrned&#xD;
in an instant.&#xD;
"I thought you would find it very rough~"&#xD;
he said, as if apologizing for tbe rougbnes~&#xD;
Then, with a thrill of pleasure, l~e took the&#xD;
small, gloved hand outstretched to him, and&#xD;
carefully assisted her along the descent, which&#xD;
momently became more difficult.&#xD;
"Surely we must be nearly down, now,"&#xD;
she said, at last; and, as she spoke, they&#xD;
&#xD;
made a sudden turn, stumbled over some&#xD;
sharp rQcks for about twenty feet farther, and&#xD;
then found themselves on smooth ground, with&#xD;
the cascade before them.&#xD;
Now, there can be no doubt that there are&#xD;
many cascades far more beautiful than this&#xD;
which was the pride and boast of Northorpe.&#xD;
Still it was beautiful enough to warrant a&#xD;
considerable amount of enthusiasm from en-&#xD;
thusiastic people, and beautiful enough to&#xD;
startle Alice Inglesby into silent admiration&#xD;
when she came upon it thus. She had not&#xD;
expected much, and it was with a feeling of&#xD;
surprise that she found herself quite taken by&#xD;
storm. Looking round, she saw that they&#xD;
were in a deep gorge between the hills, or&#xD;
rather in a sort of basin, which at one end&#xD;
opened into a ravine. On the opposite side to&#xD;
where they stood rose a stately hill, crowned&#xD;
to the summit with foliage almost tropical in&#xD;
its luxuriance; on the other, a frowning cliff&#xD;
of dark gray rock leaned far over, and threw&#xD;
its deep shadow down below. This cliff ex-&#xD;
tended round in circular shape, and, where it&#xD;
met the green hill already mentioned, a small&#xD;
stream forced its way between enormous moss-&#xD;
covered rocks, and sprang over the precipice,&#xD;
sending up a shower of spray and foam, and&#xD;
spreading out at the bottom into a glossy pool&#xD;
that lay likea sheet of crystal at Alice's feet.&#xD;
As it glided away down the ravine, falling in&#xD;
miniature cascades at every step, the same&#xD;
stream filled the solitudewith the fitful mono-&#xD;
tone of its voice, like a poem of Nature's own&#xD;
singing.&#xD;
After a long silence, Mrs. Inglesby turned&#xD;
to her companion. "We are poorly off for&#xD;
adjectives," she said, "or else we must use&#xD;
them too freely. 'Beautiful' seems to me a&#xD;
weak word for all this lavish glory; &amp;amp;et what&#xD;
better word does the language afford? Can&#xD;
you suggest one?"&#xD;
"There arc a good inuny," he answered,&#xD;
"but they are all liable to the same objection.&#xD;
We use them for lesser things, until they lose&#xD;
force, and are unfit to express our admiration&#xD;
of the greater. When you see a green mead-&#xD;
ow, or a sunny hill-side, or a stretch of shad-&#xD;
owy woods, what do you say?"&#xD;
"Generally, 'How beautiful!' or else, 'How&#xD;
Jovely!"'&#xD;
"Or else, 'How picturesque!' or some-&#xD;
times even 'How grand! Well, when you&#xD;
stood on the summit of Mont Blanc, what did&#xD;
you say?"&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
MISS INGLESBY'!&#xD;
&#xD;
"You have never stood there, or you&#xD;
would not ask me. I said-nothing."&#xD;
"And you said nothing here-and I can&#xD;
suggest nothing that is worth saying. We&#xD;
must blame ourselves-~.not the language. It&#xD;
gives us terms, but I am afraid there is no&#xD;
doubt that we debase them. Unless we say&#xD;
'Stupendous!' I really think we must hold&#xD;
our peace."&#xD;
"Let us say 'Stupendous!' then, by all&#xD;
means," answered she, smiling; "and, having&#xD;
said it, let us sit down."&#xD;
"Stop a moment," said he, as she was&#xD;
about to suit the action to the word, and sit&#xD;
down on i~ convenient rock near by. "This&#xD;
is such a public place-that is-you know&#xD;
Mrs. Reynolds and her party will be upon us&#xD;
before long. Let us explore a little, as those&#xD;
who reached here first have done."&#xD;
She hesitated an instant, then consented,&#xD;
and they moved away. As they skirted the&#xD;
pool, and crossed the stream that was hurry.&#xD;
ing down the ravine, they caught sight of&#xD;
several of their companions-some making&#xD;
very picturesque effects as they were perched&#xD;
on overhanging rocks, and others climbing,&#xD;
with laborious energy, up the steep mountain-&#xD;
side.&#xD;
'i" We will go over yonder by the cascade,"&#xD;
said Devercux. "Are you fond' of 'ferns? I&#xD;
see some beautiful ones growing there on the&#xD;
rocks."&#xD;
So, over to the cascade they took their&#xD;
way, and led on, partly by Devereux, partly&#xD;
by the ferns, and partly, also, by her own in-&#xD;
clination, Alice ascended from point to point&#xD;
of the rocks, until at last she found herself&#xD;
elevated much above her former sttnid.point,&#xD;
but profiting very little in the way of pros.&#xD;
pect. The dense undergrowth of the moun- 1&#xD;
tam shut in the view on one side; on the 1&#xD;
other, the whirling rush of the falling water&#xD;
was all that could be seen.&#xD;
"I hope this is sufficiently secluded for&#xD;
your taste," said she, looking up at Devereux I&#xD;
with an air of resignation. "I am very tired&#xD;
-may I sit down now? Thanks - yes, I&#xD;
would like my ferns."&#xD;
She sat down on a stone, and, leaning&#xD;
back against the massive 'gray rock, began&#xD;
examining the ferns and lichens which her I&#xD;
companion laid in her lap. She had taken a&#xD;
ofr her hat, and laid it beside her, as a recep- f&#xD;
ta~le for the selected specimens. Her rich t'&#xD;
hair caught the sunlight as she bent her head, s&#xD;
&#xD;
SISTER-IN-LAW.                    131&#xD;
and exercise had given a very clear and brill.&#xD;
iant color to her cheek. Beautiful always,&#xD;
she was almost more than beautiful now; and&#xD;
it was not strange that Devereux held his&#xD;
breath as he stood looking at her. She did&#xD;
not notice the gaze, partly because it was her&#xD;
policy to ignore it, but kept on talking in her&#xD;
light, graceful way about botany in general,&#xD;
and fer~as in particular, until at last his con-&#xD;
tinued silence forced itself on her attention.&#xD;
She looked up, then, with a laughing question&#xD;
on her lips; but, despite her self-possession,&#xD;
stopped short. The moment that she met&#xD;
them, his eyes told her that the issue was at&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
Now, it is not to be supposed that she&#xD;
needed to be told.-but she had not expected&#xD;
it just then. She was off her guard, as it&#xD;
were, and a shock is always unpleasant, let it&#xD;
come how it will. She colored vividly-flush-&#xD;
ing, indeed, t the very roots of her hair--&#xD;
then, as he was bout to speak, rose to her&#xD;
feet.&#xD;
"I think we had better go back,"&#xD;
she said, hurriedly. "I am quite rested now."&#xD;
But Devercux had no mind to let his op.&#xD;
portunity sliii in this way~ There had been&#xD;
nothing premeditated in the matter. The&#xD;
situation had taken him as much by surprise&#xD;
as it had taken her; but it was upon him&#xD;
now, and he meant to seize its advantages.&#xD;
The fever of sudden resolution took posses-&#xD;
sion of him, and, as is the case with a great&#xD;
many quiet men, its very novelty lent it force.&#xD;
lie had not meant to speak just now; but her&#xD;
beauty first unnerved him, and then her&#xD;
strange embarrassment lent him courage.&#xD;
When she rose, he stepped before her.&#xD;
"No, Mrs. Inglesby," he said, "don't go&#xD;
back now. Stop-at least for a minute. I&#xD;
have something to say to you.,~&#xD;
"You can say it down below," answered&#xD;
&amp;amp;lice, suddenly, unaccountably, nervously an~-&#xD;
ous to get away. "Pray, Mr. Devereux-..&#xD;
ray let us go."&#xD;
"Of course we will, if you desire it," he&#xD;
aid; but with such a look of pain on his face&#xD;
hat, although he moved aside, she stood still.&#xD;
liter all, what Ibily was this 1' Why should*&#xD;
he act so rashly? Why should she not hear&#xD;
din? She knew, or thought she knew, what&#xD;
nswer she intended to give. Why not, there.&#xD;
ore, have it over at once? In a second these&#xD;
houghts flashed -through hermind, and, in a&#xD;
econd, also, she acted on them.&#xD;

radonn mc," she said, looking at him&#xD;
with her own gracious glance and manner.&#xD;
"I did not mean to be rude. I will stay if&#xD;
you wish it."&#xD;
"Thank you," he answered, hastily. Then&#xD;
he was silent for a moment, looking at the&#xD;
spray of the cascade as it dashed by, and&#xD;
striving to grasp words in which to express&#xD;
the feeling that overmastered him. Words&#xD;
did not come to him readily at any time, but&#xD;
now he seemed to have lost all command of&#xD;
them. As her embarrassment had given him&#xD;
courage, so her self-possession robbed him of&#xD;
it. He hesitated so long that, at last, in des-&#xD;
peration, he was about to speak, when there&#xD;
came the sound of crackling boughs and&#xD;
twigs, as somebody forced a way through the&#xD;
luxuriant undergrowth, and a distant shout&#xD;
from below was answered by a voice near at&#xD;
hand, saying, "Thanks, yes-I'm looking for&#xD;
Miss Inglesby." The next moment a man's&#xD;
hand and arm appeared over the rock, grasped&#xD;
firmly the bough of a tough shrub, and, with&#xD;
this help, the body to which the arm belonged&#xD;
made an agile spring and lighted at Alice's&#xD;
side. As she drew back, the new- comer&#xD;
gained his feet, and she stood face to face&#xD;
with Lawrence Kennon.&#xD;
If Mr. Devereux had been questioned half&#xD;
an hour later, it is to be feared that he would&#xD;
have been found to entertain but a confused&#xD;
remembrance of the events, of the next few&#xD;
minutes. The appearance of his cousin&#xD;
(whom he thought fur away from Northorpe)&#xD;
was surprising enough in itself; but this sur-&#xD;
prise deepened into amazement wheii he saw&#xD;
that a recognition instantly took place be-&#xD;
tween Kennon and Alice Inglesby.&#xD;
"You I" said tl~e former, catching his&#xD;
breath with a gasp, while his face paled, and&#xD;
his eyes dilated almost instantaneously-&#xD;
"you!"&#xD;
"Yes-it is I," said Alice, quietly; then,&#xD;
after a minute, she held out her hand, saying&#xD;
a little wistfully, "Fate has ordained it, Mr.&#xD;
Kennon. You see I remember that we are&#xD;
old friends," But, instead of taking her hand,&#xD;
Kenuon folded his arms, and recoiled a step.&#xD;
"There is no question of fate or friend-&#xD;
ship in the matter," he said, coldly "This&#xD;
is simply a mistake. I was looking for Miss&#xD;
Inglesby, and Iwas told that she was here. I&#xD;
see that she is not, so I beg pardon for my&#xD;
intrusion, and leave you to the 1~te-cl-te~te which&#xD;
I disturbed."&#xD;
&#xD;
He shot one dark, resentful glance at Dcv-&#xD;
ereux as he said the last words; but the lat-&#xD;
ter was too puzzled to notice it. Indeed, as&#xD;
it chanced, there was nothing in his mind but&#xD;
cordial kindness toward his kinsman, and, if&#xD;
he could have secured a moment's time be-&#xD;
fore complete bewilderment overtook him, he&#xD;
would have liked nothing better than to ex-&#xD;
press this kindness. As it was, he stood&#xD;
still, and said nothing. Not so, Alice, how-&#xD;
ever. She was mistress of the situation by&#xD;
right of her supreme self-command, and, as&#xD;
Kennon turned to go, she laid her hand on&#xD;
his arm. Holding him captive thus, she&#xD;
spoke to Devereux with the san~e gracious&#xD;
smile that had given him hope when she&#xD;
agreed to stay, ten minutes before.&#xD;
"Mr. Kennon and I are old friends," she&#xD;
said. "We knew each other long ago, and&#xD;
he is naturally surprised to see me again-to&#xD;
see me here. If you would not mind-if I&#xD;
might ask you to leave us for a little while?&#xD;
He will take me safely down the mountain, I&#xD;
am sure."&#xD;
Within bounds of civility~, a plainer re-&#xD;
quest could hardly have beeii made. What&#xD;
Devereux replied, or how he got away, he&#xD;
never knew. He went, of course-there was&#xD;
no alternative to that-but he carried a sore&#xD;
heart with him, and it would have been yet&#xD;
sorer, if he could have heard the first words&#xD;
which Alice spoke after he was safely out of&#xD;
car-shot.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
"So this is the meeting for which we hoped&#xD;
ten years ago," she said, in her soft, full&#xD;
voice. "We meet, and you repulse even my&#xD;
friendship, because you are looking for Miss&#xD;
Inglesby, and I-am her sister-in-law."&#xD;
There was a tone in this sentence that&#xD;
stung Kennon with some latent meaning; for&#xD;
a flush came over his face, and he lifted his&#xD;
dark eyes suddenly to her own.&#xD;
" You know that is not true," he said&#xD;
quickly, almost fiercely-" you know I have&#xD;
not forgotten ten years ago-or the woman&#xD;
who promised to be faithful to me, either.&#xD;
That woman, however, was Alice Chisholm,&#xD;
and not "-he paused a moment, and added&#xD;
bitterly-" Miss Inglesby's sister-in-law."&#xD;
"We won't tear open the old wounds, or&#xD;
reopen the old quarrel," said she, gravely.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"It is all over-utterly past and gone. But&#xD;
fate having brought us together-in a man-&#xD;
ner, too, that will make it hard for us to avoid&#xD;
some slight intercourse-you will pardon me&#xD;
if I ask why Alice Chishoim cannot be your&#xD;
friend."&#xD;
"Alice Chisholm was a woman of the&#xD;
world ten years ago," he answered, still full&#xD;
of bitterness. "She has not so far forgotten&#xD;
her worldly knowledge that she should need&#xD;
to ask that question now."&#xD;
"Granting that she was a woman of the&#xD;
world," said she, with a vibration of scorn&#xD;
in her voice, "do you think that she did not&#xD;
know then, and does not know now, that you&#xD;
-you, Laurence Kennon-are the last man&#xD;
in the world to feel deeply or resent bitterly&#xD;
a mere love-disappointment 1' If you still re-&#xD;
fuse t~ take the hand which I offer-for the&#xD;
last time, remember-I shall know that it is*&#xD;
not wounded love, but wounded pride, which&#xD;
has made you so implacable."&#xD;
"You can think what you please of me,"&#xD;
said he, leaning back against the rock from&#xD;
which she had risen, and looking passionate-&#xD;
ly at the beautiful face before him. "My&#xD;
God I how I ought to bate you I" he went on.&#xD;
"To think of your treachery and your co-&#xD;
quetry-to think how you have wrecked my&#xD;
life, as much of it as was left to wreck-and&#xD;
then to think that I should come here&#xD;
now-"&#xD;
He broke off here with something like a&#xD;
gasp. She did not answer, her color did not&#xD;
deepen, her eyes did not quaiL She stood&#xD;
before him like a proud, calm statue, daring&#xD;
him, as it were, to say and do his worst.&#xD;
Suddenlyhe advanced a step and grasped&#xD;
her arm.&#xD;
"You talk of Alice Chishoim," he said,&#xD;
almost fiercely. "What if I were fool enough&#xD;
to call her back to life and accept her 'friend-&#xD;
ship!" Would she like to play the old game&#xD;
over again? I believe once was enough for&#xD;
me. Am I any better, any more desirable&#xD;
now than when so dutifully and obediently&#xD;
she gave me up-left me to live or die as&#xD;
best I could-and married-"&#xD;
She lifted hei~ hand with a silencing gest-&#xD;
ure. "Hush! For the sake of the old time,&#xD;
you can say what you please of rue; but he&#xD;
was my husband-and he is dead."&#xD;
"Yes, he is dead: and I did not mean to&#xD;
speak ill of him. Why should I? No doubt&#xD;
he was a good fellow enough-only I hated&#xD;
&#xD;
him too much ever to find it out. Well, you&#xD;
married him-not me. Now, that you are&#xD;
free again, would you marry me if I gave my&#xD;
heart up for your sport again, and asked you&#xD;
to do so?"&#xD;
Passionate as the question was, and full&#xD;
of bitter scorn-the scorn of one who meets&#xD;
some sore temptation beyond his strength, to&#xD;
which he must succumb-it was earnest with&#xD;
an earnestness that few things possess in this&#xD;
world of sham and sentiment. Perhaps the&#xD;
fire that rang in every tone stirred the heart&#xD;
of Alice Chisholm sleeping in Mrs. Inglesby's&#xD;
breast. But she was a woman of the world,&#xD;
and no outward token of this appeared on&#xD;
her proud, calm face, no glance of it flickered&#xD;
into the clear, brown eyes steadfastly facing&#xD;
his own. When she spoke, her voiq~e was&#xD;
soft and even:&#xD;
"Tell me, rather, if you would advise me&#xD;
to do so? Those prudent counsellors of&#xD;
whom you spoke are all gone now. I stand&#xD;
quite alone, with my own life in my own hand&#xD;
to make or mar as I please. Laurence, should&#xD;
I make or mar it by marrying you?"&#xD;
There was something of solemnity both In&#xD;
the form and in the tone of her appeal. For&#xD;
reply, the lids sank slowly over Kennon's&#xD;
eyes, and once more the dark flush rose in&#xD;
his cheek.&#xD;
"You know yourself," he said. "You&#xD;
know what people say of me. Why ask&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
"I ask you because you can tell me best."&#xD;
"Then I tell you that you would mar it&#xD;
beyond all hope of redemption," he answered,&#xD;
violently. "Is that enough? Ten years ago,&#xD;
when they warned you against me, I was a&#xD;
paladin compared to what I have been since.&#xD;
You did well to marry Inglesby then. Trust&#xD;
me, you will do better still to marry Devereux&#xD;
now."&#xD;
She started.&#xD;
"So-you knew that?"&#xD;
"Know it! Would I not have been blind&#xD;
and deaf if I had seen him standing here, and&#xD;
not known it? But I did not need to dis.&#xD;
cover it for myself. I reached Northorpe&#xD;
this morning, and I heard the news from half&#xD;
a dozen people before I came out here."&#xD;
"You credit it, of course?"&#xD;
"Yes; why not? We are both ten years&#xD;
older, and you are beautiful and poor, while&#xD;
Devereux, thanks to my folly, is rich, and&#xD;
ready to be won."&#xD;

&#xD;
"You forget yourself," said she, haughti-&#xD;
ly.&#xD;
"No," answered he, recklessly, "I only&#xD;
forget my new rdle-that of being an 'old&#xD;
friend' of the charming Mrs. Inglesby. Alice,&#xD;
Alice)" he went on, suddenly changing his&#xD;
tone, awl seizing her hands, "Fate, as you&#xD;
say, has brought us together once more-let&#xD;
us not throw away our last hope of happiness.&#xD;
Why should we not cast away all these bit-&#xD;
ter years, and their bitter memories? Why&#xD;
should we not live our lives out as we once&#xD;
dreamed of doing?"&#xD;
She left her hands in his clasp, but she&#xD;
smiled coldly&#xD;
"You forget," she said, "you forget that&#xD;
we are ten years older, and-poor."&#xD;
"I forget every thing but you," he an-&#xD;
swered, passionately; "every thing but the&#xD;
hope that iS shining for me in your eyes."&#xD;
"Shining only to deceive, then," she said,&#xD;
bitterly; but suddenly she cried out as if in&#xD;
pain: "Laurence, let me go. I-I cannot&#xD;
bear this. Let me go-let mc think I"&#xD;
lie let her go; and, as she sat down on&#xD;
the same stone where she had been sitting&#xD;
when Devereux's glance startled her, he&#xD;
turned his back, and, walking to the extreme&#xD;
verge of the rock, stood looking down at the&#xD;
white waters of the foaming cascade. After&#xD;
awhile she called his name, and, when he&#xD;
turned, he saw that her resolution was taken.&#xD;
"It would never do, Laurence," she said,&#xD;
gravely. "When you think it all over, you&#xD;
will see for yourself that it would never do.&#xD;
Just now you have been led away by im-&#xD;
pulse, and you forget the gulf that lies be-&#xD;
tween us. No, I don't mean your life or any&#xD;
thing connected with it," she said, as he was&#xD;
about to speak. "I mean the change that&#xD;
time has wrought in our characters, in our&#xD;
very selves. If we had been let alone ten&#xD;
years ago, the end might have been very dif-&#xD;
ferent-but now it is too late. We have&#xD;
grown apart, instead of together: you have&#xD;
lost your inheritance-I am entirely without&#xD;
fortune. We should, in every sense, mar&#xD;
each other's lives if we cast them together.&#xD;
Laurence, is it not best for us each to go our&#xD;
own way, and live, in the future as in the&#xD;
past, apart?"&#xD;
"It is for you to decide," he answered,&#xD;
striving to repress the emotion which he&#xD;
could not altogether conceal. "You were&#xD;
always reasonable and prudent in the cx-&#xD;
&#xD;
treme-even ten years ago. You mean, then,&#xD;
that we shall each continue our present game&#xD;
-that you will marry my precious cousin,&#xD;
and that I must play the fortune-hunter with&#xD;
that girl down yonder?"&#xD;
" Laurence" (she turned on him sharply),&#xD;
"do you mean to say that you do not-that&#xD;
you never have-cared for her?"&#xD;
"I mean to say that I never cared for but&#xD;
one woman in the world, and that she threw&#xD;
my love away, like t1~at "-(he snapped oft' a&#xD;
twig and tossed it on the whirling waters)-&#xD;
"I mean to say, too, that you may judge&#xD;
whether this love was dead when I tell you&#xD;
that the mere sound of your name was enough&#xD;
to drive me from Northorpe as soon as you&#xD;
entered it; and I came here to-day-and this&#xD;
is the end I"&#xD;
She put one merciless question directly&#xD;
to him: "What did you come here to-day&#xD;
for?"&#xD;
lie answered as briefly: "To ask Miss In-&#xD;
glesby to marry me."&#xD;
"And yet you have asked me?"&#xD;
"Yes, I am a fool. I have asked you."&#xD;
"Well, I will not be a fool and take you&#xD;
at your word. We are old friends-that is&#xD;
all. On the strength of that friendship let&#xD;
me wish you success in your wooing. Only&#xD;
promise me one thing-that you will be kind&#xD;
to her."&#xD;
"She would thank you for such ~onsidcra-&#xD;
tion," he said, bitterly-adding, with a sudden&#xD;
passionate vehemence, "and I thank you for&#xD;
proving to me, once for all, that ten years&#xD;
ago or to-day I am equally nothing to you!"&#xD;
"Laurence!" she said, startled in spite&#xD;
Qf herself. But she spoke too late. He had&#xD;
already flung himself from the rock and was&#xD;
gone.&#xD;
Poor Rose! It was hard on her when&#xD;
she heard-as she did hear before long-that&#xD;
Kennon had come to the falls with Mrs. Rey-&#xD;
nolds; that he stayed but a short time; that&#xD;
he saw Mrs. Inglesby; and that ho had gone&#xD;
back to N9rthorpe without seeing her. "No&#xD;
doubt it was on account of Mr. Devereux that&#xD;
he went," people said to each other, as they&#xD;
ate their luncheon, scattered about in pict-&#xD;
uresque groups over the rocks. But Rose&#xD;
knew better. A sudden instinct, an intuition&#xD;
of the truth, enlightened her; and, when she&#xD;
was told that he had met her sister-in-law,&#xD;
nothing more was needed for its confirma-&#xD;
tion. "So she has got him, too)" thought&#xD;

&#xD;
the girl, looking with gloomy eyes at Alice&#xD;
as she sat in all her brilliant beauty not La&#xD;
ofi'. It was very bitter-it was surely ver;&#xD;
hard. Was it not enough that Devereux&#xD;
who had been predestined her own captive&#xD;
should fall into the stranger's toils, but Ken&#xD;
non, too, must be a victim? Could not Alici&#xD;
be content with the rich prize, the desirable&#xD;
cousin, but must she lay hands also on tin&#xD;
one whom everybody cried out upon as unde&#xD;
sirable, and for whom she could have no pos&#xD;
sible use? Of course it will be seen that Mis~&#xD;
Inglesby was taking a great deal for granted&#xD;
but that was her way, as it is the way of&#xD;
most imaginative people. And her instinct&#xD;
certainly pointed very shrewdly to the truth.&#xD;
It would be difficult to say whether her&#xD;
fears were most relieved or realized when, as&#xD;
she sat~ silent and district in the drawing-&#xD;
room that evening, Ke~non made his appear.&#xD;
ance. She knew his step in the hall, and&#xD;
animation flashed instantly into her languid&#xD;
face. Alice knew it, too, and her eyes im-&#xD;
mediately sought Rose with a strange, intent&#xD;
gaze, of which the girl was wholly unaware.&#xD;
lier own color did not vary by a shade, nor&#xD;
did her manner change in the least, even&#xD;
when Kennon entered, and when she was&#xD;
obliged to explain their former acquaintance&#xD;
to Mrs. Inglesby. Rose heard the explana-&#xD;
tion, and, when Kennon came over to her,&#xD;
she was too much disturbed to notice his&#xD;
bearing as closely as she had wished to do.&#xD;
Instead, he was able to notice and to set his&#xD;
own interpretation upon the flushed checks&#xD;
and wistful eyes uplifted to him. But, in&#xD;
truth, this preoccupation mattered very little.&#xD;
If Rose had been able to judge, she would&#xD;
have found that he was entirely the same in&#xD;
manner as when she had seen him last. He&#xD;
had been quite unnerved that morning; quite&#xD;
thrown out of the artificial self which years&#xD;
and much experience of life had fashioned;&#xD;
but with such a luau such a state of feeling&#xD;
is only temporary To-night he was himself&#xD;
again; and all the more steeled in his pur~&#xD;
pose by a fierce contempt for his own senti-&#xD;
ment and folly. When he saw Rose's emo-&#xD;
tion, he thought, "The game is won;" and&#xD;
when he sat down by her ~side, it was with&#xD;
the determined resolve to make good use of&#xD;
his time.&#xD;
Good use of his time he certainly made;&#xD;
for, though he did not absolutely ask her to&#xD;
marry him-Mrs. Inglesby's watchful care&#xD;
&#xD;
185&#xD;
&#xD;
, and the lack of opportunity prevented that-&#xD;
r he did every thing else which it is practicable&#xD;
~ to do in a room full of people. When he&#xD;
', went away at last, he left Rose in a fever of&#xD;
excitement, triumph, and indecision. He had&#xD;
- asked her, at parting, if she meant to walk&#xD;
s the next morning, and she had told him yes&#xD;
-feeling confident that he would meet her,&#xD;
and ask the question he had not been able to&#xD;
- ask that night. Yet, strange to say with re-&#xD;
- gard to her answer, she was by no means&#xD;
clear. It is one thing to like a man and flirt&#xD;
with him to the very verge of love-making,&#xD;
and quite another to promise or intend to&#xD;
marry him. Rose had long since taken the&#xD;
first step, but, when it came to the second,&#xD;
she had still sense enough left to pause. She&#xD;
knew what a storm of opposition she must&#xD;
expect from her parents; what an outcry&#xD;
from the world; but these things counted&#xD;
little with her. In the ignorant boldness&#xD;
of youth, she was ready to defy them. The&#xD;
fear that tugged at her heart-strings, the fear&#xD;
that made her hold back, was the fear of&#xD;
Kennon himself. Not the fear of what his&#xD;
life had been and might be yet-for there,&#xD;
again, her ignorance made her bold-but the&#xD;
fear of his love, the distrust of his sincerity.&#xD;
She had felt it always, more or less; but,&#xD;
z~otwithstanding that he had never been so&#xD;
devoted as on that night, she felt it that&#xD;
night more than ever before. perhaps it was&#xD;
his strange departure from the cascade, or&#xD;
thftt "foi'mer acquaintance~~ with her sister-&#xD;
in-law, of which he had spoken so lightly, or&#xD;
the earnest gaze in Alice's eyes when she met&#xD;
them once or twice, or perhaps only that in.&#xD;
tangible something which can always be felt,&#xD;
if not detected, 'in an acted or spoken false-&#xD;
hood. Whatever it was, the fact remained&#xD;
the same. Once at least, before it was too&#xD;
late, she wavered-once at least, asked her.&#xD;
self whether the gain was worth the risk.&#xD;
But such questions are easily answered when&#xD;
years are few and impulses strong. "If I&#xD;
must be miserable," thought the girl of'&#xD;
eighteen, "it is better to be miserable with&#xD;
him than without him. Besides, I do b~lievo&#xD;
-I will believe-that he loves me!" And so'&#xD;
the die was cast. When she laid her head&#xD;
down' on the pillow that night, her decision&#xD;
was made-she would accept him, and abide&#xD;
the consequences.&#xD;
Meanwhile there was another person be.&#xD;
sides herself whom indecision and coriflictkept&#xD;

&#xD;
wakeful during much of that night. Long&#xD;
after Rose's eyes had closedin slumber, Alice&#xD;
Inglesby still paced her room, with a face&#xD;
strangely set and brows strangely knitted.&#xD;
It was evident that she was thinking deeply;&#xD;
and truly she had cause enough for thought.&#xD;
In the course of our lives it chances that most&#xD;
of us influence directly or indirectly, in greater&#xD;
or lesser degree, the lives of others. But, as&#xD;
a general rule, we do not recognme even this&#xD;
influence until after the effect has taken place.&#xD;
We are rarely conscious of it at the time, for&#xD;
we walk ever in a mist; and the day of our&#xD;
death is not more effectually hidden from us&#xD;
than the consequences of our least actions.&#xD;
Yet sometimes this veil of ignorance is lifted&#xD;
-partially, at least. Sometimes we are able&#xD;
to behold, as in a mirror, the direct results of&#xD;
certain acts, and, beholding them, we must&#xD;
be strangely reckless of things present, and&#xD;
things to come, if we do not pause-awed a&#xD;
little by our own responsibility. It Was such&#xD;
a moment, just now, with Lice. She was&#xD;
painfully conscious that she held i~z her hand&#xD;
the thread of fate for three lives besides her&#xD;
own. She was oppressed with the sense that,&#xD;
on her decision, rested the future of three&#xD;
people; and that circumstance-the potent&#xD;
monarch of human life-seemed for once pas-&#xD;
sively awaiting her command. All day the&#xD;
sense of this responsibility had been with her,&#xD;
and all day she had rebelled against and de.&#xD;
nied it. "I am only one of the actors," she&#xD;
thought. "I have no more control over the&#xD;
drama than they." But to-night this flimsy&#xD;
self-deception was at an end. To-night she&#xD;
saw before her the stern array of inevitable&#xD;
consequences, and, since they were inevitable,&#xD;
faced them steadily. "Once for all, I will&#xD;
weigh the matter in every aspect," she&#xD;
thought; and, as the hours went on, she still&#xD;
paced the floor, and still weighed it.&#xD;
She had summed up the whole case in its&#xD;
personal application to themselves, when she&#xD;
spoke to Kennon in the morning; but there&#xD;
was the other side, the side not personal to&#xD;
themselves, to be considered. When she said&#xD;
to him, "You have lost an inheritance; lam&#xD;
wholly without fortune. We should, in every&#xD;
sense, mar each other's lives if we cast them&#xD;
together," she stated a truth which he could&#xD;
not gainsay; but when she was called upon&#xD;
to decide for Devereux and Rose, it was not&#xD;
so easy "They go into the matter with their&#xD;
eyes open," she said. "Rose loves Kennon,&#xD;
&#xD;
and Devereux loves me-is not that enough?"&#xD;
But then came the question-Did they go&#xD;
into it with their eyes open? Would Rose&#xD;
be likely to marry Kennon if she could hear&#xD;
him declare that he had never loved but one&#xD;
woman, and she the woman who had given&#xD;
him up ten years before? Would Devereux&#xD;
accept even her hand if he could read her&#xD;
heart and see how persistently it clung to the&#xD;
man who had first wakened its romance and&#xD;
passion? Yet what of these things'? Was&#xD;
it once, in a thousand cases of marriage, that&#xD;
love was equal on both sides? Did not hun-&#xD;
dreds of men and women marry from motives&#xD;
more unworthy than Kennon's or her own,&#xD;
and yet make excellent husbands and wives?&#xD;
She could answer for her own after-conduct,&#xD;
she was sure. She liked Devereux well&#xD;
enough to do more than tolerate him. His&#xD;
character was pleasant to her, his manners&#xD;
suited her, and his tastes agreed with hers.&#xD;
This was a good foundation, and of herself&#xD;
she had reason to be confident. But Ken-&#xD;
non! There, indeed, was cause for hesi-&#xD;
tation. What his life had been, she knew;&#xD;
what it would be, she had sufficient experi-&#xD;
ence of the world to foresee. Knowing the&#xD;
one, ~'oreseeing the other, could she stand&#xD;
aside and let Rose rush headlong on her fate?&#xD;
In vain she thought that it was none of her&#xD;
affair; that the girl's self, and the girl's par-&#xD;
ents, were alone concerned. Conscience rose&#xD;
up in reply, and said: "It is you alone who&#xD;
can save her." "But why should I save her?"&#xD;
she asked. "She is nothing to me; while&#xD;
Kennon-whose interests I am serving-is&#xD;
very much."&#xD;
-She had scarcely asked the question when&#xD;
she stopped a moment, and her glance, by&#xD;
some strange magnetism, was attracted to a&#xD;
miniature that lay on her toilet-table. Almost&#xD;
unconsciously, she took it up and opened it~&#xD;
When the lid of the case flew back, the face&#xD;
of a young man looked at her from the ivory.&#xD;
It was the likeness of her husband. For a&#xD;
second she was startled, since usually this&#xD;
miniature remained in her writing-desk, and&#xD;
she could not think how it chanced to be here,&#xD;
until she suddenly remembered that Mrs. In-&#xD;
glesby had asked for it several days before,&#xD;
and that doubtless it had been returned that&#xD;
day during her absence. But, however the&#xD;
fact of its presence might be explained, there&#xD;
was no ignoring the effect which this presence&#xD;
produced. She looked steadfastly at the&#xD;
&#xD;
bright, young face, until large tears gather&#xD;
in her eyes, and misted her sight. She ha(&#xD;
loved this dead man very tenderly - more&#xD;
perhaps, as she might have loved a favorite,&#xD;
brother, than as women usually love thei:&#xD;
husbands-but still with a depth and pathos&#xD;
that could not but rush back over her wher&#xD;
she gazed thus on the shadow of the face thai&#xD;
was forever gone from earth. "My poo&#xD;
darling !-my poor, gallant boy! "she thought&#xD;
weeping softly, and wiping away the tears a~&#xD;
they fell. "lie loved me very dearly, and&#xD;
can never prove my love for him 1-I can&#xD;
never repay the tenderness he gave me."&#xD;
She said this half aloud, and she had scarcely&#xD;
finished saying it, when she started. Were&#xD;
her eyes bewitched, or did the face bear a&#xD;
likeness to Rose which she had never noticed&#xD;
in it before? reople spoke of the resem-&#xD;
blance, she' knew; but she had never been&#xD;
able to discover it until now. Now suddenly&#xD;
it flashed upon her. Those violet eyes, look-&#xD;
ing up at her, were strangely soft and wistful&#xD;
for a man's; and how like they were, in form&#xD;
and tint, to those she had seen gazing into&#xD;
Kennon's face that night! Those lips, so&#xD;
softly curved and clearly cut, wore Rose's&#xD;
own smile-the smile half arch, half sweet,&#xD;
which she so well remembered. Then it came&#xD;
back to her, like a fo~gotien dream, how the&#xD;
dead brother loved the little sister who had&#xD;
been his pet and darling, how tenderly he&#xD;
spoke of her, and how often he wished that&#xD;
Alice could see and know her. "You would&#xD;
be able to do her so much good," he had said;&#xD;
and now-it was no wonder Alice closed the&#xD;
case with a sharp pang, and turned away.&#xD;
W~s it good she was about to do this sister&#xD;
of her dead husband?&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
Iv may be imagined that, with thoughts&#xD;
such as these for her companions, Mrs. Singles.&#xD;
by was little disposed for sleep. In fact, she&#xD;
still paced her chamber long after the other&#xD;
inmates of the house were wrapped in quiet&#xD;
slumber-.-long after even Rose's white lids&#xD;
had sunk over her violet eyes. It was well&#xD;
on toward two o'clock when, at last, she sud-&#xD;
denly stopped and made an impatient gest-&#xD;
ure.&#xD;
"Things seem fantastic and unreal at&#xD;
night," she said "Somehow, they are al-&#xD;
&#xD;
I ways magnified, and events or feelings of&#xD;
I really small importance assume gigantic pro-&#xD;
portions when viewed at such a time. I know&#xD;
perfectly well that all these absurd scruples&#xD;
on the one hand, these old, sentimental recol-&#xD;
lections on the other, will fade into absolute&#xD;
insignificance to-morrow morning. There-&#xD;
fore, why should I torment myself with&#xD;
them? Has the surprise of the day un-&#xD;
strung rue? Am I mad that I don't see,&#xD;
not only what I could, but what I must,&#xD;
do?"&#xD;
She walked abruptly across the floor, and&#xD;
drew back a curtain from ouie of the windows&#xD;
-a window looking out over the garden and&#xD;
toward the Devereux House. The fragrant&#xD;
stillness of the starlit summer-night seemed&#xD;
to come to her like a soft caress; there was&#xD;
not the faintest gleam of light anywhere, not&#xD;
the faintest sound of moving life-only the&#xD;
perfume of the flowers, the brightness of the&#xD;
stars, and the dark outline of the stately roof&#xD;
cutting against the steel-blue sky. As she&#xD;
stood quite motionless, she heard a clock, far&#xD;
away in the heart of the silent town, striking&#xD;
two; and at that moment, almost as if the&#xD;
stroke had been a signal, a wild glare of flame&#xD;
burst forth from the hitherto dark and silent&#xD;
Devereux House.&#xD;
For an instant, Alice stood petrified, ab-&#xD;
Bolutely doubting the evidence of her senses,&#xD;
and chained to the spot by sheer amazement;&#xD;
but this inaction did not last more than an&#xD;
instant. She was a woman of rare coolness&#xD;
and presence of mind, and she realized at&#xD;
once that, owing to the lateness of the hour,&#xD;
the flames were likely to make fatal headway&#xD;
before any one was roused in the quiet neigh-&#xD;
borhood. She could see that the fire had&#xD;
burst forth in the kitchen wing of the house.&#xD;
If the alarm was given immediately, there-&#xD;
fore, it might be possible to save the main&#xD;
build~ig. She sprung from the window, and,&#xD;
running hastily down the corridor on which&#xD;
her chamber opened, she was soon thunder-&#xD;
ing vigorously at Colonel Inglesby's door.&#xD;
"What's the matter? Who the deuce is&#xD;
that?" cried a startled voice within.&#xD;
"It is I-Alice!" she answered. "Mr.&#xD;
Devereux's house is on fire! The alarm ought&#xD;
to be given at once! Oh, sir, pray-pray get&#xD;
up!"&#xD;
Colonel Inglesby needed no further adjura-&#xD;
tion. She heard him say, "The devil!" and&#xD;
make one spring to the fool,. "P11 be there&#xD;

&#xD;
in a minute," he answered. "Rouse the ser-&#xD;
vants, Alice! Send somebody to knock 'em&#xD;
up over there. Where did the lire burst out?&#xD;
Has no alarm been gi~en?"&#xD;
"I have not heard a sound," she replied.&#xD;
"There are never any policemen in this part&#xD;
of the town, and everybody seems asleep.&#xD;
The glare must wake them soon, however."&#xD;
"Is the fire serious?"&#xD;
"Yer~ serious, I should think."&#xD;
She waited to say no more, but hastened&#xD;
back to her own room to see how matters&#xD;
were progressing. Even in these few minutes,&#xD;
the fire hadgained considerably; but the house&#xD;
itself was yet wrapped in utter stillness. A&#xD;
sudden, horrible fear came over her. What&#xD;
if one of the tragedies so rife in these days&#xD;
of terror had been perpetrated? What if&#xD;
the household had been murdered, and the&#xD;
house fired to conceal the crime? Anything&#xD;
seems possible in a moment of panic, espe-&#xD;
cially if that panic comes at night. Her&#xD;
heart seemed to stand still for a minute; then&#xD;
a sudden flood of resolution came to her.&#xD;
She turned, left the room, ran down-stairs-&#xD;
thinking, even in this moment of supreme&#xD;
excitement, that it was fortunate she had not&#xD;
undressed-and, groping her way through the&#xD;
dark house, managed to unbar one of the&#xD;
dining-room windows, and let herself into the&#xD;
garden. The whole thing occupied such a&#xD;
short space of time that she saw scarcely any&#xD;
change in the state of affairs when she stepped&#xD;
out into the open air. She did not stop to&#xD;
wonder at the quietness which still brooded&#xD;
over every thing, nor to admire the effect of&#xD;
the flames so vividly thrown into relief against&#xD;
the deep-purple sky. She sped swiftly down&#xD;
one of the paths which led to the gate open-&#xD;
ing into the Devereux grounds. It was as&#xD;
she reached this, and laid her hand on the&#xD;
familiar latch, that the first cry of "Fire!"&#xD;
rang out in the street; and, the next moment,&#xD;
the deep tones of the alarm-bell sounded.&#xD;
"Thank God!" she said-but still she&#xD;
held on her way, knowing that succor could&#xD;
not come for some time, and that meanwhile&#xD;
the fire might render the escape of those&#xD;
within difficult, if not dangerous. Quickly&#xD;
she sped across the flower - beds, quickly&#xD;
through the hedges and under the drooping&#xD;
vines laden with odorous blossoms, quickly&#xD;
'across the lawn damp with clinging dew,&#xD;
quickly up the broad stone steps into the por-&#xD;
tico. Then seizing the bell-handle, she pulled&#xD;
&#xD;
it violently again and again. Still, no sound&#xD;
answered-though she could hear it tinkling&#xD;
far away.&#xD;
"Good Heavens! what can be the mat-&#xD;
ter!" she thought, turning round to see if&#xD;
no rescue was at hand. As she looked,&#xD;
she saw a man come dashing hurriedly over&#xD;
the lawn toward her. The front gates were&#xD;
still fastened, so that he had evidently leaped&#xD;
the pilings. As he sprang up the steps, and&#xD;
they stood face to face in the bright glow, she&#xD;
saw that it was Kennon.&#xD;
"Laurence!" she cried.&#xD;
"Alice!" said he-in the tone of one&#xD;
overwhelmed with surprise.&#xD;
But the next instant he remembered him-&#xD;
self and drew back stiffly.&#xD;
"I beg pardon, Mrs. Inglesby. I was sur-&#xD;
prised to see you here; but I suppose that,&#xD;
like myself~ you wish to rouse the inmates.&#xD;
Is it possible nobody is awake yet?"&#xD;
"Nobody has stirred," she answered. "It&#xD;
seems to me exceedingly strange! I am very&#xD;
glad you have come. I saw the fire first,"&#xD;
she went on, quickly, "my room is on this&#xD;
side-I left my father-in-law dressing-and-&#xD;
and-oh, pray ring the bell!"&#xD;
This confused speech did not sound very&#xD;
much like the stately Mrs. Inglesby, but in&#xD;
truth Kennon's dark eyes were reading her&#xD;
face so keenly, and she was so well aware&#xD;
that he was wondering how she came to be&#xD;
awake and dressed at such an hour of the&#xD;
night, that her usual self-possession quite&#xD;
forsook her.&#xD;
"Ring the bell!" she repeated, sharply, as&#xD;
he still stood looking at her. "Surely they&#xD;
m~~st wake after awhile!"&#xD;
Peal after peal at the bell, knock after&#xD;
knock on the door producing no effect, Ken-&#xD;
non shrugged his shoulders.&#xD;
"Devereux always slept like one of the&#xD;
seven champions of Christendom," he said,&#xD;
"and it is evillent his servants share the pe-&#xD;
culiarity. It' you'll stay here, Mrs. Inglesby,&#xD;
I'll go round and try to get into the house&#xD;
another way. This really does begin to look&#xD;
serious!"&#xD;
"Surely the fire-company will be here&#xD;
soou," said she, anxiously-very anxiously,&#xD;
he thought.&#xD;
"The alarm has just been given," he an-&#xD;
swered. "They are not likely to be here&#xD;
very soon. I am afraid the old house will&#xD;
certainly go."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh, what a shame-what a pity!"&#xD;
"Quite a pity!'~ said he, philosophically.&#xD;
"119w are you going to get in?" she&#xD;
asked, as he turned away.&#xD;
"I shall break a window of the conserva-&#xD;
tory," he answered, coolly.&#xD;
Then he walked off, but when he reached&#xD;
the conservatory, he fouz~d, much to his sur-&#xD;
prise, that she had followed him.&#xD;
"If you have no objection, I will go in,&#xD;
too," she said. "I can wake the servants,&#xD;
while you rouse Mr. Devereux."&#xD;
"Are you afraid to trust mc with him?"&#xD;
asked he, with a sudden bitter tone in his&#xD;
voice, a sudden angry flash in his eye. "I&#xD;
have not taken a degree in assassination&#xD;
yet."&#xD;
"You know better than that," she an.&#xD;
swerod, haughtily. "Mr. Devereux is no&#xD;
more to md than any other acquaintance&#xD;
whose life I desire to save-no more than&#xD;
one of his servants. But if the house is&#xD;
doomed, I may be t~ble to save a few valua-&#xD;
bles; and since there is nobody else to do it,&#xD;
I feel it right to go in."&#xD;
"I feel it right to tell you that there's&#xD;
risk in it."&#xD;
"Scarcely just yet, I think."&#xD;
He glanced up at the root' which was al-&#xD;
ready beginning to blaze in several places-&#xD;
shrugged his shoulders again-smashed a&#xD;
window, climbed in, and opened a door for&#xD;
her. Together they entered the house, and&#xD;
soon found their way to the upper regions.&#xD;
While Kennon went to wake his cousin, Alice&#xD;
roused the startled servants, who 'scarcely&#xD;
waited to throw on their clothes before they&#xD;
fled in wild alarm.&#xD;
Then suddenly, as if by magic, the grounds&#xD;
became thronged with people, the engines of&#xD;
the fire-company came up at a gallop, and be-&#xD;
gan to play upon the roof, adventurous spirits&#xD;
thronged the house, tossing the costly furni-&#xD;
ture recklessly out of the windows and injur-&#xD;
ing far more than they saved. Other~ again,&#xD;
came in to pilfer, the flames rushed steadily&#xD;
on, the people talked, the engines played, the&#xD;
flowers stared at the light of the great con-&#xD;
flagration, or withered away beneath its&#xD;
fierce heat-a sce4e of wild pandemonium&#xD;
replaced the odorous quiet of the summer&#xD;
night.&#xD;
In the midst of this, Devereux came has-&#xD;
tily up to Kennon, who stood on the outskirts&#xD;
of the crowd, talking to Rose Inglesby. It&#xD;
&#xD;
struck them both, as he approached, that he&#xD;
looked singularly pale and agitated, even for&#xD;
a man whose house was burning down.&#xD;
"Kennon," he said, hastily, "do you&#xD;
know where Mrs. Inglesby is? Have you&#xD;
heard-have you seen her anywhere ? ~'&#xD;
"Mrs. Inglesby!" Kennon repeated, start.&#xD;
ing, and growing so pale that the pallor of the&#xD;
other face was, by contrast, insignificant and&#xD;
natural. "My God-no! Is she missing?"&#xD;
"I can't find her,'~~the other answered,.&#xD;
"and one of the servants says something&#xD;
about seeing her in the library. But she&#xD;
can't have been so foolish-so mad-as to&#xD;
stay there until now. Perhaps she has ~one&#xD;
home.-Miss Inglesby, do you know?"&#xD;
"I am sure she has not gone home, Mr.&#xD;
Devereux," Rose answered, trembling with a.&#xD;
sudden, vague fear.&#xD;
The two men looked at each other. In.&#xD;
all their lives neither of them ever forgot&#xD;
that horrible, sickening moment.&#xD;
"Did you leave her in the house?" Deve.&#xD;
reux sharply asked.&#xD;
"I left her for you to bring out," Kennon&#xD;
as sharply answered.&#xD;
It was easy, then, to see how the thing&#xD;
occurred. Devereux had not heard of her'&#xD;
presence in the house when he hastily left&#xD;
it, Kennon had quitted it even before that,&#xD;
thinking Alice safe under the guardianship.&#xD;
of the man she had been so eager to save.&#xD;
She, on her part, had lingered in the library'&#xD;
until escape was cut off by the flames.&#xD;
"What are we to do?" Devereux asked,.&#xD;
in the midst of the awful, hushed panic which&#xD;
seized them.&#xD;
"You may do what you like," said Ken-~&#xD;
non, fiercely. "lam going after her."&#xD;
He turned quickly toward~ the house, but&#xD;
Rose caught his arm. At that moment she&#xD;
forgot evety thing-her sister-in-law, Deve.&#xD;
.reux, maidenly reserve, every thing but the&#xD;
fear that he would rush madly into danger.&#xD;
"0 Mr Kennon," she cried, "don't-&#xD;
don't be rash! Perhaps Alice Ass gone'&#xD;
home!"&#xD;
Kennonanswered nothing; he only brushed.&#xD;
her aside as if she had beex~ a butterfly, and&#xD;
went on his way.&#xD;
Of what' ensued he had never more than a.&#xD;
vague remembrance. He recollected mount-&#xD;
ing a fireman's ladder to the library.window'&#xD;
-that same window at which Alice had stood.&#xD;
a few nights before, thinking of him-aixi&#xD;

&#xD;
climbing into the room already full of dense,&#xD;
black smoke. But all this was. singularly&#xD;
confused; nothing was clear, until he found&#xD;
himself kneeling over a half-suffocated and&#xD;
unconscious woman on the sward below.&#xD;
Even in her unconsciousness, however, she&#xD;
did not relax her clasp of a small picture&#xD;
which she held.&#xD;
Strangely enough, it was the engraving&#xD;
which had hung over Devereux's writing-&#xD;
table.&#xD;
How brightly and joyously the next morn-&#xD;
ing broke over the blackened ruin of the once&#xD;
stately Devereux House! How gayly the birds&#xD;
sang among the roses, how softly the shadows&#xD;
flickered over the green turf! How little any&#xD;
thing in Nature seemed to reck of the destruc-&#xD;
tion which had been wrought between the set-&#xD;
ting and rising of the sun!&#xD;
"And it would be all the same if it had&#xD;
been a human life instead of a house!"&#xD;
thought Alice Inglesby, as she rose and stood&#xD;
at the same window where she had been&#xD;
standing when the flames broke forth the&#xD;
night before. Her attack of unconsciousness&#xD;
had been very slight-for she was not a&#xD;
woman prone to fainting-fits-and, thanks to&#xD;
a superb constitution, had left no ill effects&#xD;
beyond a little languor and paleness. There&#xD;
might have been more, however, if she had&#xD;
not been "kept up" just then by the ficti-&#xD;
tious strength of excitement. During her&#xD;
vigil of the dawn, she had taken a resolve&#xD;
which had been lacking in her vigil of the&#xD;
night. Somehow, light had come to her, as&#xD;
well as to the world. Things which had been&#xD;
conflicting before, seemed thoroughly harmo-&#xD;
nious now. Standing there in the bright sun-&#xD;
light, her future life showed itself in a new&#xD;
aspect. Every thing within her was so&#xD;
changed, that the whole outside world seemed&#xD;
changed also. Should she ever forget the&#xD;
look in Kennon's eyes, when she opened her&#xD;
own on his face, there on the turf last night?&#xD;
it had gone straighter to her heart than if he&#xD;
h~~leaded with all the passionate eloquence&#xD;
that 4ver stirred a human tongue. And here&#xD;
let it be said that, being a woman of sense,&#xD;
and not a sentimental fool of any age (for&#xD;
sentimental folly is not limited to sixteen),&#xD;
she did not for a moment think of attaching&#xD;
the least importance to the mere fact of his&#xD;
having, in romantic parlance, "saved her&#xD;
life." She knew perfectly well that he would&#xD;
&#xD;
have done the same good office quite as will-&#xD;
ingly for the cook or the chambermaid. It&#xD;
was that look in his eyes which haunted her&#xD;
-which seemed to beckon her on to the per-&#xD;
petration of the rankest act of folly ever per.&#xD;
petrated by a "woman of the world."&#xD;
Then the thought of Rose and of Harry-&#xD;
the two strangely mingled-came back to her&#xD;
as they had come the night before. She&#xD;
seemed to see the fair, rose-bud beauty of the&#xD;
girl, and to feel the same pang of absolutely&#xD;
painful pity which she had felt the night be-&#xD;
fore, when she saw her falling into the toils&#xD;
of the adventurer, who avowedly wooed her&#xD;
only for her fortune. Yet the night before&#xD;
she had steeled her heart and said, "Where&#xD;
is the remedy?" Now she seemed to see the&#xD;
remedy.&#xD;
"My lif~ does not matter," she said aloud.&#xD;
"I have only myself to consider; and, there-&#xD;
fore, why should I consider at all? Nobody&#xD;
can be injured or aggrieved if I throw myself&#xD;
away; while Rose-ah! it is different with&#xD;
her. She has a mother's heart to be broken.&#xD;
Poor~ foolish child! she has even a heart of&#xD;
her own to suffer !-and how it would suffer&#xD;
when she learned the truth! How little she&#xD;
will thank me for such consideration," she&#xD;
added, with a short laugh; "and yet-if she&#xD;
only knew it-how infinitesimal is the heart-&#xD;
ache or two she will suffer now, to the ocean&#xD;
of anguish I will spare her! Am I mad, I&#xD;
wonder?" she went on, walking to the mir-&#xD;
ror and looking at herself. "I should cer-&#xD;
tainly have said so yesterday. But to-day I&#xD;
feel inclined to act before sanity comes&#xD;
back."&#xD;
Mrs. Inglesby, senior, who, like all the&#xD;
rest of the household, felt singularly restless&#xD;
and unsettled after the night of adventure,&#xD;
had wandereQinto the garden, and was blank.&#xD;
ly surveying the smoking ruins which marked&#xD;
the place where the house had so lately stood,&#xD;
when, to her amazement, Alice advanced from&#xD;
one of the dining-room windows toward her.&#xD;
"My dear, you up?" she cried, aghast.&#xD;
"Thanks, yes, I have quite recovered,"&#xD;
Alice answered. Then, hastening on to cut&#xD;
short the remonstrance she felt to be impend-&#xD;
ing: "I saw you from my window, and I hur-&#xD;
ried tlown at once, because I thought I could&#xD;
not find a better opportunity for speaking to&#xD;
you-in confidence, if you have no objec-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
Of course, h~rs. Inglesby had no objection,&#xD;
&#xD;
and only a few words were necessary to put&#xD;
matters on a confidential footing between&#xD;
them. The mother's heart was too sorely&#xD;
anxious not to be glad of any counsellor, much&#xD;
more of any helper; and Alice spoke with the&#xD;
quiet composure of one certain of her own&#xD;
power. Before very long, Mrs. Inglesby's&#xD;
worst anxiety was relieved, and her worst&#xD;
fears allayed.&#xD;
"Find some excuse for detaining Rose,&#xD;
this morning, from her usual walk," said&#xD;
Alice, "and I will guarantee that Laurence&#xD;
Kennon shall never trouble her again."&#xD;
"But-but, my dear, how will you manage&#xD;
it?" Mrs. Inglesby cried.&#xD;
"Never mind how I shall manage it," the&#xD;
other answered. "I promise to accomplish&#xD;
it-that is all. You will hear the result be.&#xD;
fore very long," she added, as she turned tow-&#xD;
ard the ho4se; "and I hope you will be a&#xD;
little sorry when I say that it will probably&#xD;
force me to leave you."&#xD;
"But-Mr. Devereux?" exclaimed the&#xD;
elder lady, who n~w began to have an inkling&#xD;
of the truth.&#xD;
"Rose will console Mr. Devereux, I dare&#xD;
say," Alice answered, quietly. And then she&#xD;
walked away.&#xD;
It would be hard to say how deeply Rose&#xD;
was chagrined when her mother made an ab-&#xD;
solute demand for herpresence that morning,&#xD;
and when she found that, without betraying&#xD;
a most undue anxiety for her usual walk, she&#xD;
must submit to remain at home. Prudence,&#xD;
for once, carried the day. She submitted&#xD;
with a very bad grace, consoling herself with&#xD;
the thought that Kennon was again safely&#xD;
domiciled in Northorpe, and that opportune.&#xD;
tics for seeing him were many. So, although&#xD;
it is to be feared that Mrs. Inglesby did not&#xD;
have a very amiable companion, she still car-&#xD;
ried her point, and the field was left clear for&#xD;
Alice.&#xD;
At the hour when Rose was in the usual&#xD;
habit of going out, Alice came down-stairs,&#xD;
and left the house. As she descen~led the&#xD;
front steps, she met a servant ascending&#xD;
them with a letter in his hand, and, when he&#xD;
touched his cap and extended it, she saw that&#xD;
it was addressed to herself. In a second, her&#xD;
heart gave a great leap. The writing told her&#xD;
at ~once that it was from Devereux, and she&#xD;
must needs have been dull beyond the meas-&#xD;
ure of ordinary dulness, if she had not at&#xD;
once divined the nature of its contents. For&#xD;
&#xD;
a moment she stood still, looking at the en.&#xD;
velop as it lay in her hand-.thinking, per-&#xD;
haps, how hard it was to fight against fate.&#xD;
She had thought to put temptation aside, and&#xD;
here it met her at the very threshold of her&#xD;
new determination. She had thought it would&#xD;
be easier to ignore the rich prize which chance&#xD;
had thrown into her life than to absolutely&#xD;
nerve herself to the point of rejecting it; yet&#xD;
here it was in her hand, and acceptance or&#xD;
rejection was now a matter of necessity. She&#xD;
would not have been a woman, if the tempta-&#xD;
tion had not been great-so great that she&#xD;
dared not trust herself to consider it, that she&#xD;
dared not cuter the house to answer that let-&#xD;
ter while still free to answer it as she chose.&#xD;
After a minute, she turned to the servant.&#xD;
"I am just going out," she said. "I can-&#xD;
not stop to read this now. Tell Mr. Devereux&#xD;
that I will send an answer as soon as I re-&#xD;
turn."&#xD;
The man bowed and departed with this&#xD;
consolatory message. Turning hastily in&#xD;
the opposite direction, Alice went her way&#xD;
toward the square in which Rose usually took&#xD;
her morning walk, and where she was sure of&#xD;
meeting Kennon.&#xD;
When she entered, she strolled up and&#xD;
down the paths laid out so trimly between&#xD;
plats of green award; but no sign of Kennon&#xD;
appeared. Several nurses were sitting round&#xD;
the fountain that played in the centre of the&#xD;
square; children were trundling hoops up&#xD;
and down the walks; one or two men were&#xD;
resting on shady benches, reading morning&#xD;
papers; and a pair of school-girls strolled&#xD;
past, with their heads bent over their French&#xD;
grammars. For a short time, Alice was puz-&#xD;
zled by Kennon's absence from the tryst;&#xD;
but then she remembered that she was early,&#xD;
and, choosing a walk which was uninvaded,&#xD;
she sat down on a bench to wait. Waiting&#xD;
is, at all times, tiresome work; and, being in&#xD;
a state of excitement, she found it more than&#xD;
usually tiresome this morning. So tier band&#xD;
soon found its way to her pocket, and brought&#xD;
forth Devereux's letter. Having brought it&#xD;
forth, the next step was to open and read it.&#xD;
She had read it twice, and her face was still&#xD;
bent over the page, when a ringing step on&#xD;
the gravel-path made her look up just as&#xD;
Kennon's shadow fell over her.&#xD;
He looked astonished-as, indeed, there&#xD;
was good reason that he should be.&#xD;
"I am glad to see you so entirely recov~&#xD;

&#xD;
ored," he said, stopping before her, but speak-&#xD;
ing very frigidly. "I feared that the results&#xD;
of your adventure last night might prove&#xD;
-very serious."&#xD;
"It might have proved serious to some&#xD;
people," she answered. "Fortunately for&#xD;
me, however, I do not feel a nervous shock&#xD;
very much, and there was little else in that.&#xD;
If you had been ten minutes later, though-"&#xD;
" You might have been beyond recovery,"&#xD;
said he, coolly finishing her sentence as she&#xD;
paused. He was on his guard now, and not&#xD;
even into his eyes flickered any thing more&#xD;
than the quietest courtesy. .&#xD;
"It was very horrible," said she, in a low&#xD;
voice. "I never knew be re what suffoca-&#xD;
-tion meant ; but the dense moke quite over-&#xD;
powered me, and I suppose I must have beej&#xD;
insensible for some time before you came." -&#xD;
" Why did you go there ?" he asked, ?nX&#xD;
able to repress his curiosity on that points&#xD;
" There were some very fine pictures&#xD;
there," she answered. "I wanted to save&#xD;
some of them. After all, how ever, I did not&#xD;
succeed in doing so."&#xD;
Then there was a pause. Kennon was&#xD;
still standing before her, but he now made a&#xD;
-movement as if he would have bowed and&#xD;
passed on; only just then she looked up and&#xD;
poke quickly-with the manner of one who&#xD;
had nerved herself to an effort.&#xD;
"I believe you have an appointment with&#xD;
Rose," she said. " She is not here--will not&#xD;
be here this morning. If you do not object,&#xD;
however, I should like to say a few words to&#xD;
you." -&#xD;
She pointed to a vacant place on the bench&#xD;
beside her, and, after a slight hesitation, Ken-&#xD;
non sat down.&#xD;
"I-confess I do not understand-" he be-&#xD;
gan; but she interrupted him.&#xD;
" You do not understand what brought me&#xD;
here ? That is very likely ; but, if you will&#xD;
be patient a moment, you shall hear. We&#xD;
are old friends, and I wish to ask your ad-&#xD;
vice. Will you read that?"&#xD;
She held Devereux's letter toward him, i&#xD;
~and, with increased surprise,.he received it.&#xD;
He gave a start as soon as he saw the open-&#xD;
ing words, but he did not raise his eyes and,&#xD;
as he read it, she watchefl him keenly. He&#xD;
held his face under tolerably good control,&#xD;
but she had once known its least weather-&#xD;
sign, and her eyes were not likely to deceive&#xD;
tier now. Yet, whern he finished, he looked&#xD;
&#xD;
up and spoke with more passion and less&#xD;
bitterness than she had expected.&#xD;
"Well," said he, "tell me now the mean-&#xD;
ing of this. You did not use to be cruel for&#xD;
the mere sake of cruelty, and I am loath to&#xD;
think that you have learned to find pleasure&#xD;
in the infliction of pain. Yet your motive&#xD;
for giving me such a letter puzzles me. Do&#xD;
you want me to go and cut this man's throat,"&#xD;
he went on, with ill-restrained vehemence,&#xD;
"that you show me the words of love with&#xD;
which he offers you my inheritance ? "&#xD;
"I told you what I want," she answered.&#xD;
" I want your advice." .&#xD;
" My advice ? I can give it to you in two&#xD;
words-marry him, lie is rich, and he is a&#xD;
fool-marry him !"&#xD;
" He is not a fool," she said, with some-&#xD;
thing like indignation in her voice. " He is a&#xD;
man of whose love any woman might be proud&#xD;
-whom any woman might well learn to love.&#xD;
That letter "-she pointed to it as she spoke&#xD;
-" has touched me more than I can say.&#xD;
Only a fine nature and a gentle heart could&#xD;
have written such words as those."&#xD;
" Marry him, then !-for Cod's sake, mar-&#xD;
ry him!"&#xD;
.She rose from her seat, and took a turn&#xD;
down the walk---then came back and stood be-&#xD;
fore him, the flickering shadows falling softly&#xD;
over her resolute face and earnest eyes. .&#xD;
"Laurence," she said, " do you remem-&#xD;
ber yesterday ?-do you remember telling me&#xD;
that Fate had brought us together once more,&#xD;
and that we should not throw away our last&#xD;
hope of happiness ? Is yesterday to-day with&#xD;
you ? Think for a moment, and then tell me&#xD;
-can you say that now ?"n'&#xD;
In a moment he understood her, and he,&#xD;
too, rose to his feet. They faced each other&#xD;
steadily in the golden sunlight before he&#xD;
pointed to Devereux's letter.&#xD;
" I say it now as I said it then," he an-&#xD;
swered. "But, with this before me, I am&#xD;
constrained to add-don't let me stand in&#xD;
your way. There is the path to fortune--&#xD;
take it now, as you took it before."&#xD;
" You are unjust !" she cried, passionate-&#xD;
ly. "It was no path to fortune that I took&#xD;
before. And if I take it now it will only be&#xD;
because by such words as these you prove to&#xD;
me that Rose Inglesby's heiress-ship is more&#xD;
to you than I am."&#xD;
Her shaft struck home. Adventurer&#xD;
though he was, Kennon had still enough of&#xD;
&#xD;
142&#xD;
&#xD;
At this point our story ends. At this&#xD;
point the sister-in-law, who had entered Miss&#xD;
Inglesby's life, and changed its whole current&#xD;
and meaning, went out of it again, and left--&#xD;
for a brief space, at least--not a little of deso-&#xD;
lation behind her. Of course, Rose was too&#xD;
proud to showghow, deeply and sharply the&#xD;
blow had struck ; but, despite her bravery,&#xD;
she suffered many a sharp pang, and knew&#xD;
many a dreary moment, before it even slightly&#xD;
healed. Can we wonder at this ? The girl&#xD;
had not given her heart unasked, as some&#xD;
girls do, and therefore she had not incurred&#xD;
the legitimate penalty of folly. She had&#xD;
merely suffered it to be won; she had merely&#xD;
fallen into a snare which might have en-&#xD;
trapped an older and wiser woman ; and, in-&#xD;
stead of waking slowly, and with a sickening&#xD;
consciousness of " too late " to this knowl-&#xD;
edge, it was forced on her by one sharp&#xD;
stroke.~ It may be said that she had cause)&#xD;
for gratitude in learning the truth so soon.&#xD;

T rlE E N D.&#xD;
&#xD;
MISS INGLESBY'S SISTER-IN-LAW.             14&#xD;
&#xD;
honor and sincerity left to feel it. A dark-red&#xD;
flush surged over his face, and, stepping for-&#xD;
ward a few feet, he caught her hands,.&#xD;
" Tell me what you mean ?" he demande,&#xD;
almost roughly. "I am .dull at reading r'id-&#xD;
dles, and this has grown beyond my comn-&#xD;
prehension. Why have you come here ?-&#xD;
why have you showed me that letter ?-why&#xD;
do you speak to me like this ? You know&#xD;
that Rose Inglesby is nothing to me; and&#xD;
that you--are every thing. Do you mean&#xD;
that you are willing to give up him for me?/"&#xD;
lie pointed once more to the letter-now&#xD;
lying on the ground at his feet--and Alice's&#xD;
gaze followed the gesture half sadly. Stoop-.&#xD;
ing, as if by a sudden impulse, she lifted the&#xD;
open sheet of paper, gently folded it, and laid&#xD;
it aside on the bench. Then she turned back&#xD;
to Kennon, and held out her hand.&#xD;
-," Just that way I put him out of my life,"&#xD;
she said. "If' you wish to take me, here I&#xD;
am."&#xD;
&#xD;
'148&#xD;
&#xD;
No doubt she had, and no doubt she felt this&#xD;
before very long; but at first--well, suffering&#xD;
is apt to make even the wisest unreasonable,&#xD;
and it was not strange that at first she only&#xD;
felt the sore bitterness of affection wasted&#xD;
and trust betrayed. She was very young,&#xD;
however; and the young rally quickly from&#xD;
even the deepest blows. After a while, her&#xD;
parents took her abroad, and then Alice's&#xD;
prophecy came true. While travelling they&#xD;
met Devereux, who-whether to solace his&#xD;
disappointment, or to improve his mind--had&#xD;
also left Northorpe. Rose thought that he&#xD;
improved on acquaintance very decidedly ;&#xD;
and, when she returned to America, he ac-&#xD;
companied her. The latest news from Nor-&#xD;
thorpe leaves no doubt but that they will&#xD;
soon be married.&#xD;
And Alice ? Well-Alice is not unhappy.&#xD;
In the first place, she is married to a man&#xD;
whom she loves, and, in the second place, she&#xD;
is married to a man who loves her. These&#xD;
two facts would enable her to bear much, if&#xD;
she had much to bear, which, in truth, has&#xD;
not been the case. Men of Kennon's stamp&#xD;
do not reform suddenly ; but there is at least&#xD;
reasonable ground for hoping that with him&#xD;
the worst is over, and that he will never fling&#xD;
himself quite as recklessly against public&#xD;
opinion in the future as in the past. Let&#xD;
what will come, however, his wife has girded&#xD;
up herself to bear it; and, if gentleness, and&#xD;
courage, and devotion, can save him, he may&#xD;
yet be saved. With all the troubles that&#xD;
have encompassed her, it is not probable that&#xD;
Mrs. Kennon has ever regretted her choice.&#xD;
From the first she realized how inadequate&#xD;
Rose's strength would have proved for the&#xD;
burden laid on her; how terrible on both&#xD;
sides would have been the marriage which her&#xD;
intervention alone prevented. Feeling this,&#xD;
she is recompensed ; but it is doubtful wheth-&#xD;
er Miss Inglesby ever has known, or ever&#xD;
will know, all that she owes to her sister-in-&#xD;
aw.&#xD;

I T was a very pleasant group that was as-&#xD;
sembled ia the drawing-room of Colonel&#xD;
Dulaney's country-house, as the dusk was&#xD;
dying away over the wintry hills, and the&#xD;
short December day drew rapidly to a close&#xD;
-a very sociable group, too, although it was&#xD;
composed entirely of ladies. They had shortly&#xD;
before come up from dinner, leaving the gen-&#xD;
tlemen to the enjoyment of their olives and&#xD;
wine, and, finding twilight in possession of&#xD;
the room, had unanimously agreed in think-&#xD;
ing that it would be a pity to disturb it by&#xD;
the invasion of lamps. So the only light in&#xD;
the apartment was that given forth by a&#xD;
large wood-fire, which illuminated every thing&#xD;
in its immediate neighborhood, while shadows&#xD;
gathered deeply in all the corners, and the&#xD;
silvery moonlight traced pale outlines on the&#xD;
carpet at the other end of the long room.&#xD;
There is nothing prettier than this soft min-&#xD;
gling of twilight and firelight, and the four&#xD;
ladies grouped around the hearth-rug made a&#xD;
charming picture as the red radiance flick-&#xD;
ered over them-shining on the rich silks&#xD;
which two of them wore, and flashing back&#xD;
from the bright eyes of the other pair, who&#xD;
were dressed simply, as became their youth,&#xD;
yet elegantly, as became their station.&#xD;
The first of the silken-attired ladies was&#xD;
lying indolently back in a deep chair, while&#xD;
one of her slender hands held a fire-screen of&#xD;
Oriental device before a very fair and high-&#xD;
bred face-a face over which thirty-five sum-&#xD;
mers had passed so lightly as to leave only&#xD;
added beauty behind them. This was Mrs.&#xD;
Dulaney, the most charming and popular&#xD;
hostess of all the gay and hospitable country-&#xD;
side; and whoso caught one gleam of her&#xD;
frank blue eyes, never marvelled even once&#xD;
10&#xD;
&#xD;
concerning either the charm or the popu-&#xD;
larity.&#xD;
Next to her a bonny brown-haired, brown-&#xD;
eyed girl was nestling on an ottoman, with&#xD;
her tinted face half shaded by the sweeping&#xD;
draperies of her hostess-a dainty, petite&#xD;
creature, dressed in a soft blue fabric, the&#xD;
Vandyck corsage of which showed the whitest&#xD;
neck in the world, and a diamond pendant&#xD;
that glittered in the firelight. It was a&#xD;
proverb with her friends that Ethel Lamar&#xD;
wasnever silent for five minutes; but more&#xD;
than five minutes had elapsed since her last&#xD;
remark, and still the little lady sat quiet-&#xD;
her bright brown eyes fastened on the glow-&#xD;
ing 4~oals as intently as if she were reading her&#xD;
fortune there.&#xD;
In the corner of a sofa not far distant sat&#xD;
a lady who was dressed in black silk, so&#xD;
heavy and stiff that it rustled like armor&#xD;
whenever she moved-a lady whose face, in&#xD;
repose, was somewhat plain, somewhat severe,&#xD;
and marked by the lines of at least fifty years,&#xD;
but whose smile, when it came, was so cheery&#xD;
and good-humored that it left nothing to be&#xD;
desired either in appearance or expression.&#xD;
She was the only one of the quartet who&#xD;
was busy with any occupation, but her nimble&#xD;
fingers were knitting soft, white wool; and,&#xD;
as the firelight glanced back from her pol-&#xD;
ished needles, it also gleamed over her firm&#xD;
hands, across one of which there ran a deep-&#xD;
red scar, exactly like a sabre-stroke.&#xD;
On the other end of the same sofa, in an&#xD;
attitude of supreme comfort, a stately, rich-&#xD;
hued brunette was reclining, with her feet&#xD;
doubled up in some inscrutable girl-fashion,&#xD;
and her dress sweeping the floor like a royal&#xD;
train. Do what she would, Alice Palmer al-&#xD;

Lamar flushed crimson..-" Give us the story sincerely loved, and honestly meant to marry&#xD;
&#xD;
~....after I had finished amusing myself. This&#xD;
was my cousin, Harry Wilmot. I had known&#xD;
him all my life, and loved him all my life;&#xD;
and, although he often expostulated with me&#xD;
about my coquetry, ~ bore with him in quite&#xD;
an exemplary manner--.at least I thought so'&#xD;
then. Now I think that it was lie who bore&#xD;
with me, and that very patiently. I was en-&#xD;
gaged to him in a sort of tacit fashion that&#xD;
had never been publicly acknowledged, and&#xD;
did not bind me in the least. Nothing had&#xD;
ever been said about marriage, yet I certainly&#xD;
meant to marry him, and I am sure that no-&#xD;
body ever was more devoted to another than&#xD;
he-poor fellow I-was to me.&#xD;
"Well, things had been going on in this&#xD;
way for some time, and Harry had to find&#xD;
what consolation he could in the number of&#xD;
my admirers, when a new family moved into&#xD;
our neighborhood, and, being people of evi-&#xD;
dent wealth and culture, were receii~ed with&#xD;
open arms-~-more especially since they proved&#xD;
to be hospitable and charming in extreme&#xD;
measure. Their house was always open, and&#xD;
one elegant entertainment was scarcely over&#xD;
before another was on the tap~e. This fact&#xD;
alone insured their popularity. The neighbor-&#xD;
hood, having been very stagnant before this&#xD;
new life flowed into it,. was by no means dis.&#xD;
posed to be severely critical with regard to&#xD;
the pleasant sources of this life. One and all,&#xD;
we adopted the Clavenings, and the Claverings&#xD;
in turn amused us. We had never been&#xD;
amused before, and our gratitude was extreme.&#xD;
The C~laverings, en masse, soon became the&#xD;
county toast. I say en masse, yet the family&#xD;
was in truth rather small, consisting only of&#xD;
its respective heads, two handsome daughters,&#xD;
and (as report soon told us) a son absent in&#xD;
Europe. The eldest of these daughter's, Isabel&#xD;
Clavering, was soon my intimate friend, as&#xD;
young ladies reckon friendship, and, as she&#xD;
was even more giddy and reckless than I, she&#xD;
speedily led me into more mischief than I had&#xD;
previously found for myself. Soon sober peo-&#xD;
plc began to be scandalized at our proceedings.&#xD;
In fact, they were what in these days would&#xD;
be called 'outrageously fast.' My dear, good&#xD;
father, in whose partial eyes I could do no&#xD;
wrong, said little or nothing; but Harry de.&#xD;
cidedly disapproved of Miss Clavering, and&#xD;
unhesitatingly signified as much. Our 'first&#xD;
serious disagreement was on this score. He&#xD;
begged me to give up a friend who did tue&#xD;
only injury, and I indignantly refused. She&#xD;
&#xD;
was my friend, I replied, in that spirited man-&#xD;
ner which young ladies so much admire, and I&#xD;
should not resign her, let people say or do&#xD;
their worst. Harry urged the point no further,&#xD;
but from that day a barrier of coldness rose&#xD;
between us.&#xD;
"Of course, you can all guess what came&#xD;
next. The son and heir of the Clavering&#xD;
house..-.-Edward was hi~ name-eame back&#xD;
from Europe, bringing a friend with him, and&#xD;
Woodlawn (the name of the Clavening villa)&#xD;
became more than ever the headquarters of&#xD;
gayety and dissipation. I profited in an es-&#xD;
pecial manner by this, for the grounds of our&#xD;
respective residences immediately adjoined,&#xD;
and, when our friendship grew so warm that&#xD;
we were obliged to see each other every&#xD;
day, We found that a short cut through the&#xD;
shrubberies was pleasanter and more conven-&#xD;
ient than s~ long ride or dnivO round by the&#xD;
road, so a gate was cut in the wall dividing&#xD;
oiki~ domain, and of this gate each household&#xD;
kept a key. These keys were in frequent de-&#xD;
mand, for matters had how reached such a&#xD;
pass that, whenever I was not with the~Clav-&#xD;
cringe, some one or other of the Claverings&#xD;
was with me.&#xD;
"As you may readily, imagine, the two&#xD;
young men made the already attractive house&#xD;
ten times more attractive. They were both&#xD;
handsome, and both singularly fascinating-&#xD;
especially- Edward Clavering, whose face I&#xD;
see as clearly now as I over saw it' in reality&#xD;
thirty years ago. It was a face of the type&#xD;
which I have always liked best-..-.regular fea..&#xD;
tures, pale complexion, silken~brown hairs&#xD;
beautiful, soft, violet eyea~ and the moSt per-&#xD;
fect mouth I ever saw out of marble. In&#xD;
figure he Was slight and graceful, with en-&#xD;
quisite hands and feet. His fniend--.Ridge-&#xD;
icy, by name-.-was also exceedingly hand..&#xD;

in versatile talentS and accomplishments,&#xD;
while they were both fall of that je we eais&#xD;
quoi of travelled nature which is sopeculiarly&#xD;
attractive to untravelled 'natures. "Don't&#xD;
think" (here Mrs. Stuart glanced round the&#xD;
listening trio, and shook her head very stern-&#xD;
ly) "that I am painting them in these bright&#xD;
colors to excuse the story which is to- fol-&#xD;
low. Not a bit of it. If I met two such&#xD;
chevaliers now, I should be able to tell 'that&#xD;
there Was something a little' bisarre~-~a~slight&#xD;
flavor, as it were, of Bohemianism-in their&#xD;
style, which might jar on conventional ideas,&#xD;

al mind. But at that time I was in the full&#xD;
noonday of the sublime scorn of convention.&#xD;
alities, with which every clever young person&#xD;
begins the world; so the freshness which&#xD;
these strangers brought into my life was all&#xD;
the more acceptable because it had just that&#xD;
slight flavor of Bohemia.&#xD;
"Perhaps" (smiling a little) "you have&#xD;
some curiosity to know which of the two I&#xD;
flirted with. For the matter of that, I tried&#xD;
my hand on both, though Clavering was the&#xD;
one I liked best. Certainly he was a charm-&#xD;
ing companion, and his flattery-of course, it&#xD;
was flattery, though I did not think so then-&#xD;
might well have turned the head of an older&#xD;
and a wiser woman. To say, in the language&#xD;
of the present day, that he was 'devoted to&#xD;
me,' is to say very little indeed. He tried&#xD;
every art in his power-and those arts' were&#xD;
many-to make me fall in love with him. I&#xD;
did not exactly do that, but I liked him&#xD;
thoroughly, and am ashamed to say that I&#xD;
encouraged him to the top of his bent. Harry&#xD;
stood it all with tolerable quietness for a&#xD;
while-I think he wanted to see how far I&#xD;
would go, if left entirely to myself-but after&#xD;
a time even his patience gave way. I re-&#xD;
member perfectly the day on which we finally&#xD;
arrived at an open rupture. He came in one&#xD;
morning, and, as usual, found Edward Claver-&#xD;
ing with me. Instead of paying a short visit,&#xD;
and then taking leave as he usually did, in a&#xD;
ease of this kind, he established himself with&#xD;
a book in a corner of the drawing-room, and&#xD;
waited until Clavering was, in a measure,&#xD;
forced to take ki~ departure very much in ad-&#xD;
vance of his ordinarytime for doing so. Af-&#xD;
ter he had bowed himself out, 1, who was&#xD;
much provoked at losing another hour of ten-&#xD;
der and gallant compliments, vouchsafed not&#xD;
a word to Harry, but went to the piano, and,&#xD;
sitting down, began to play. My cousin read&#xD;
his volume of Bacon's Essays with exemplary&#xD;
patience through half an hour of musical&#xD;
m~&amp;amp;znge remarkable only for its noise, and it&#xD;
was only when I rose at last, and closed the&#xD;
piano with a perceptible bang, that he rose,&#xD;
too, and came forward.&#xD;
"' If you have no other engagement just&#xD;
now, Rachel,' he said, quietly, 'I should like&#xD;
to speak to you.'&#xD;
'"I am at your service,' said I, 'though&#xD;
it seems to me that you might have spo-&#xD;
ken tome any time within the last two hours.'&#xD;
&#xD;
"'Might I!" he said~ 'VITeII, it seems to&#xD;
me that you were occupied with Clavering un-&#xD;
til he left, and that you have been occupied&#xD;
with the piano ever since. However, I was&#xD;
determined to remain until you were at lei-&#xD;
sure to give me a little of your time, because&#xD;
I want to place a plain alternative before you,&#xD;
and ask you a long-deferred and decisive&#xD;
question.'&#xD;
"'With or without my permission, I pre-&#xD;
sume!' said I, with an emphasis which was&#xD;
meant to be very sarcastic.&#xD;
"'Yes,' answered he, gravely, 'with or&#xD;
without your permission-though I scarcely&#xD;
think you will withhold it from me.'&#xD;
"'And pray why not?' demanded I,&#xD;
haughtily.&#xD;
"'Because it is to your interest as well as&#xD;
mine that the issue should be met and settled,'&#xD;
answered he, looking pale but determined.&#xD;
'Rachel, you must know as well as I that&#xD;
matters cannot go on like this. I have bovnc&#xD;
a great deal from you, through my great love&#xD;
for you, but I cannot bear to be treated as a&#xD;
toy which you contemptuously fling aside, or&#xD;
more contemptuously take up at your pleas.&#xD;
nrc. I recognize this at last, and I recognize,&#xD;
also, that you must choose between me and&#xD;
these new associates who have estranged you&#xD;
from me.'&#xD;
"'Estranged me from you, indeed!' said&#xD;
I, with disdain. 'You are mistaken. It is&#xD;
your own senseless jealousy that has es-&#xD;
tranged us-if we arc estranged. We have&#xD;
'spoken on this subject before,' continued I,&#xD;
loftily, 'and I must beg you to understand&#xD;
that now, as heretofore, I decline to submit to&#xD;
dictation in regard to my friends or associ-&#xD;
ates.'&#xD;
"'Then,' said soy cousin, 'you force me&#xD;
to place before you the alternative of which I&#xD;
have spoken. I do not think there is any&#xD;
need for me to tell you how truly and how&#xD;
faithfully I have loved you for many years.&#xD;
You know it. Yet the time has come when&#xD;
you must choose between the acquaintances&#xD;
of yesterday and the friend of your youth.&#xD;
Rachel, you must give up the Claverings, or&#xD;
you must give up me. My cousin-my dear&#xD;
cousin-which will you take? You can no&#xD;
longer have both.'&#xD;
"For a moment this determined attitude&#xD;
of my vassal petrified me; but I had some-&#xD;
thing of a temper, and, if my memory serves&#xD;
me right, I stamped my foot, and blazed&#xD;

penalty shall I incur if I decline to take ad-&#xD;
vantage of the choice which you are kind&#xD;
enough to offer me?'&#xD;
"'You will send away from you, perhaps&#xD;
forever, a friend who would do any thing to&#xD;
'serve you, Rachel. Is that a little?'&#xD;
"' I am young, and pretty, and rich,'&#xD;
said I, scornfully. 'I shall find plenty of&#xD;
other friends.'&#xD;
"'If you think t1~~zt,' said he, a little&#xD;
hoarsely, 'if you can take such a tone as&#xD;
that to one/who has loved you as long and as&#xD;
well as I have done, it is time indeed to go.&#xD;
But, 0 Rachel, Rachel! have you never&#xD;
loved me-do you not love me-even in the&#xD;
least degree, that you can throw me off like&#xD;
a worn glove?'&#xD;
"'I should like you very well if you would&#xD;
only let me alone,' said I, in the tone of one&#xD;
from whom a reluctant concession is wrung.&#xD;
'But you do worry so, Harry) and you have&#xD;
taken such an unaccountable dislike to these&#xD;
delightful Olaverings.'&#xD;
"'Some day you will be able to account&#xD;
for the dislike easily enough,' said he, gloom.&#xD;
ily. 'But it may be too late then. Rachel,&#xD;
for God's sake, be warned !-for God's sake,&#xD;
drop those people! They are not fit ass6ci-&#xD;
ates for you.'&#xD;
"' I won't hear another word!' cried I,&#xD;
stopping my ears. 'I won't listen while my&#xD;
friends are abused and slandered.'&#xD;
"'Rachel,' said my cousin, growing mo-&#xD;
inently paler and more earnest, 'would you&#xD;
like to know the character of the man who&#xD;
has just left you?'&#xD;
"'Not from your lips,' answered I, angrily.&#xD;
'I don't trust a word that you say of him.'&#xD;
"'He is an unprincipled adventurer,'&#xD;
Harry went on, steadily, 'he is indeed noth-&#xD;
ing more nor less than a professional gambler.&#xD;
can prove this.'&#xD;
"'How, pray?'&#xD;
"'By the testimony of people who have&#xD;
seen and known him at other places.'&#xD;
"' I don't believe one word of it!' I said,&#xD;
stamping my foot again.&#xD;
&#xD;
149&#xD;
&#xD;
"'You accuse me of falsehood, then?'&#xD;
"'No-but I accuse you of listening 'to&#xD;
his enemies, and of being blinded by jealousy.&#xD;
If it is true, why don't you expose him?'&#xD;
"'Would you give him up if I did?' (this&#xD;
very eagerly).&#xD;
"'Never!' answered I, grandly. 'I cling&#xD;
to my friends all the more when they arc&#xD;
slandered and persecuted.'&#xD;
"'Then you see why I don't expose the&#xD;
scoundrel. Can I have the whole county talk.&#xD;
ing of your flirtation-God knows they might&#xD;
even call it your love-affair !-with a profess.&#xD;
signal gambler, and cke~xdier d'industrie? I&#xD;
am not thinking of nor pleading for myself,&#xD;
Rachel, when I pray you to break off all con-&#xD;
nection with such a man.'&#xD;
"'I am not to be dictated to,' said I,&#xD;
drawing back the hands which he attempted&#xD;
to take, 'and I positively decline to surrender&#xD;
a pleasant friend because you see fit to make&#xD;
vague accusations against him.'&#xD;
"'I shall see if your father thinks them&#xD;
vague,' said he.&#xD;
"'Do I' answered I, scornfully. 'The ro7e&#xD;
of tale-bearer suits you so admirably that you&#xD;
must allow me ~o congratulate you on your&#xD;
new mWer, and ~o wish you good-morning!'&#xD;
" With that Icourtesied grandly, and swept&#xD;
'out of the room, leaving Harry still standing&#xD;
on the floor. A few minutes later, however,&#xD;
T had the satisfaction of hearing him gallop&#xD;
from the front-door, and I knew that he was&#xD;
gone-never to come back again, as he had&#xD;
done for so many happy years. Was Edward&#xD;
Clavering (whom I had not by any means&#xD;
made up my mind to marry) worth quite such&#xD;
a sacrifice as this? 'Even with all my ruffled&#xD;
pride to help me, I was not quite able to an-&#xD;
swer that question in the affirmative.&#xD;
"I managed, however, to console myself&#xD;
very well with Edward Clavering. In the&#xD;
week which followed Harry's unusual a~er-&#xD;
tion of himself~, and consequent departure&#xD;
from the scene of action, I was more than&#xD;
ever at Woodlawn (for he did not fulfil his&#xD;
threat of speaking to papa; partly, as I&#xD;
learned afterward, because he was busy col-&#xD;
lecting tangible proof of Clavering's antece-&#xD;
dents), and my wilful feet went 'didly nearer&#xD;
and nearer the verge of that fateful precipice&#xD;
of love, down which many women tumble&#xD;
headlong into misery.&#xD;
"To let you understand exactly how near I&#xD;
was to it, Imust tell you that, on~ cert~ln lovely&#xD;

150                       TUE STOW&#xD;
Indian summer afternoon, when Clavering an&#xD;
I were out riding, he formally addressed m&#xD;
-having seen, no doubt, that he might ~af&#xD;
ly venture to do so. Now, of course I don'&#xD;
need to tell you that it is not every man wh~&#xD;
knows how to make a declaration, which, ci&#xD;
itself, will go half-way toward winning a woni&#xD;
an's heart; iz~ fact, the art of doing so i&#xD;
more rare than any other with which I am ac&#xD;
qualuted. Clavering's proposal was simpl~&#xD;
perfect-passionate, graceful, chivalrous, al&#xD;
and more than al~ that the most sensitive&#xD;
fancy could have demanded, or the most sensi&#xD;
tive tastesanctioned. If men would only com&#xD;
prehend that a woman's fancy cats be shocked&#xD;
and a woman's taste outraged, byiauc1~erie or&#xD;
such occasions, I am inclined to think tha&#xD;
there might be fewer untoward wooings. Wh~&#xD;
I did not accept my suitor on the spot, I don'i&#xD;
know, unless it was that my cousin's warning&#xD;
had, after all, left an impression on my mind&#xD;
and inspired me with a vague distrust of thu&#xD;
accomplished gentleman, which made mc&#xD;
hesitate when it came to the actual point of&#xD;
putting all my future life into his 'hands. At&#xD;
all events, I did hesitate-.-I paused-wavered&#xD;
-finally asked for time to consider his offer.&#xD;
He yielded very gracefully to this request,&#xD;
and, having listened with tacit favor to his&#xD;
suit, I was pledged to give an early and de-&#xD;
cisive answer.&#xD;
"The next day was stormy, and I did not&#xD;
go to Woodlawn.-.. neither did any of the&#xD;
Claverings come to me. It was a day of such&#xD;
fierce rain and tempest as belongs only to the&#xD;
autumn, and, since I was entirely alone, I did&#xD;
t pass a very cheerful time. My father was&#xD;
) ~tiiattime a judge on the bench of the Sm.&#xD;
preme Court of the State, but he did legal&#xD;
business for his friends occasionally, and it&#xD;
chanced that he had been summoned, early&#xD;
that morning, to make the will of a dying&#xD;
man-~-t very i~gimate associatewho lived a&#xD;
few miles distant. .&amp;amp;s the day advanced, I&#xD;
saw clearly that he could not return before&#xD;
nightfall-nor after it either, for that matter~&#xD;
The streams intervening between us would&#xD;
be too high for him to cross, I felt sure, and,&#xD;
if the rain continued, he might be water.&#xD;
bound f'or several daye~ I knew he would&#xD;
dislike this exceedingly, for he never left me&#xD;
alone when he could possibly avoidit, and on&#xD;
the present occasion he would be particularly&#xD;
loath to do so, since there chanced at that&#xD;
time to be a deposit of unusual value in the&#xD;
&#xD;
L7 OF A SOAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
d house. Not long before, a very wealthy and&#xD;
o eccentric old lady of the neighborhood had&#xD;
died, and left my father executor of a will in&#xD;
t which she bequeathed all her property, and&#xD;
n especially all her jewels (for, by a singular&#xD;
freak, she had invested to the amount of half&#xD;
her fortune in precious stones), to him, to be&#xD;
s held in trust for the heir or heirs of a long-&#xD;
lost (and everybody said long - dead) son.&#xD;
v These jewels my father had for some time&#xD;
1 kept in his own possession, meaning to take&#xD;
~ them to a city, the first time he went, and&#xD;
- lodge them in a bank. You may think that&#xD;
- it was very imprudent to have kept jewels to&#xD;
the amount of a hundred thousand dollars in&#xD;
an ordinary country-house for any length of&#xD;
time; but, in those days, and in quiet country&#xD;
regions, robbery was almost Wholly unknown,&#xD;
and I have visited many houses where neither&#xD;
the plate-closet nor the jewel-box was consid-&#xD;
ered worth the trouble of a lock. If these&#xD;
jewels had been his own, my father would&#xD;
have felt no anxiety about them; but, be-&#xD;
cause they had been placed in his hands as a~&#xD;
trust, he had been a little nervous, and wished&#xD;
* t~ put them in safer keeping than his own.&#xD;
This had been deferred from time to time,&#xD;
however; and now, on this stormy Novem-&#xD;
ber evening, he was on one side of a swollen&#xD;
stream, 'and I on the other, with the jewels of&#xD;
old Mrs. Hardie in my sole guardianship.&#xD;
"I confess, however, that the thought of&#xD;
the jewels did not disquiet me very much. I&#xD;
only thought how lonely and ennuyie I was.&#xD;
So I wrote a note, begging Isabel Clavering&#xD;
to come and stay with me, giving the jewels&#xD;
as an excuse why I could not leave the house&#xD;
entirely unprotected. The note was answered,&#xD;
not by Isabel, but by Edward. He had come&#xD;
to bring hi5 sister's regrets-she was quite&#xD;
unwell, and~ could not venture6 through the&#xD;
rain; but could not I be prevailed upon to&#xD;
come over and 'stay with her? This proposal&#xD;
was only too tempting to me, but I could not&#xD;
reconcile it to my conscience to leave the&#xD;
jewels; so I told Edward that I could not&#xD;
go. He urged me to do so-urged me strong-&#xD;
ly and repeatedly-but I could be very obsti-&#xD;
nate when I chose, so I resolutely declined;&#xD;
and at last, as night was closing and the&#xD;
storm increasing, he wae obliged to leave&#xD;
without me~ Reluctantly enough, he bade&#xD;
me good-evening, and started to leave the&#xD;
room, when suddenly he stopped, turned, and&#xD;
came back to where I sat by the fire.&#xD;

&#xD;
THE STORY&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
"'Rachel,' he said, in a low, passionate&#xD;
voice, 'when am I to have my answer?'&#xD;
"Now, this question provoked rue. I was&#xD;
by no means a lovesick maiden, in whose&#xD;
eyes my lover could do no wrong, but a sensi-&#xD;
tive, fastidious woman, whose fancy was only&#xD;
too easily repelled by the slightest solecism&#xD;
of taste or chivalry. The circumstances of&#xD;
time and place branded the question as a pro-&#xD;
gumption in my opinion, and I answered it&#xD;
haughtily and indifferently:&#xD;
"' If you choose to wait for my answer,&#xD;
Mr. Clavering, you can have it when I have&#xD;
made up my mind; if not, you caW take it&#xD;
now.'&#xD;
"'And suppose I take it now?' said he,&#xD;
a little hoarsely.&#xD;
"I looked up into his eyes, with a flash,&#xD;
I am sure, in my own. They were steadfast,&#xD;
determined, and anxious to a degree that&#xD;
startled me. His face, too, was pale and set,&#xD;
I thought, as the changeful firelight fi,~ckered&#xD;
over it. Still, I was angry-it seemed as if&#xD;
he took advantage of my loneliness to press&#xD;
his point in this manner.&#xD;
"'If you take your answer now,' said I,&#xD;
coldly, 'you may not find it very much to&#xD;
your taste. It is, unequivocally, No!'&#xD;
"'Rachel!'&#xD;
"The tone in which he uttered this excla-&#xD;
mation startled me even more than his eyes&#xD;
had done. It was violent; it was almost&#xD;
menacing; and for the first time I realized&#xD;
how late it had become, 'and how entirely&#xD;
alone I was. I rose to my feet and looked-&#xD;
or endeavored to look - like a tragedy&#xD;
queen.&#xD;
"'Have you forgotten yourself, Mr. Clay-&#xD;
ering, or have you forgotten who I am, that&#xD;
you venture to address me in such a manner&#xD;
as this?'&#xD;
"'No,' answered he, trying evidently to&#xD;
collect himself. 'I remember both perfectly.&#xD;
You have answered my presumption very&#xD;
well, Miss Huntingdon, and I accept your&#xD;
decision. It woutd be ungentlemanly, I pre-&#xD;
sume, to hint that you may ever regret it.&#xD;
With my best wishes for your future hap-&#xD;
piness, I have the honor to bid you good-&#xD;
evening.'&#xD;
"He bowed here, and, without offering to&#xD;
touch my hand, left the room. The next&#xD;
moment I saw him cross the veranda, and&#xD;
take the dripping path which led through the&#xD;
shrubberies to the gate communicating with,&#xD;
&#xD;
01' A SOAR.                       151&#xD;
the Clavering domain, of which I have a!-&#xD;
ready spoken.&#xD;
"~rhen I sat dowu-.--i confess a little&#xD;
stunned by this brief and most unexpected&#xD;
scene. What had so suddenly transformed&#xD;
the most gallant and tender of suitors I could&#xD;
not imagine, and' my amazement was so great&#xD;
that for a time it certainly subordinated every&#xD;
other feeling. I had no doubt of my own&#xD;
power to lure him back if I wanted him-an&#xD;
important if already in my reflections-but&#xD;
what could possibly have changed him so&#xD;
completely in so short a time? Had he only&#xD;
been playing a part, and now, for some un-&#xD;
known reason, had it become worth his while&#xD;
to throw off the mask? Try as I would, I&#xD;
could find no clew to the enigma which satis-&#xD;
fied me, and at last I started from my thoughts&#xD;
to find the room quite dark, and the fire gone&#xD;
down to a bed of ashes and coals.&#xD;
"It is not a cheerful thing to be alone in&#xD;
an isolated country-house at six r. M. on a&#xD;
rainy November evening. I shivered, and&#xD;
iang the bell for lights. 'Make up the ire,&#xD;
John,' I said to the servant who brought&#xD;
them, 'and you must sleep in the dining-'&#xD;
room to-night. Papa cannot get back, I am&#xD;
sure.' Having given this order, I felt some-&#xD;
what relieved, for John was large enough and&#xD;
had pluck enough to be a match for any or-&#xD;
dinary burglar. Of course, he did not fancy&#xD;
~exchanging his usual comfortable quarters for&#xD;
a shake-down in the dining-room, but he said,&#xD;
'Yes'ni,' with a due amount of respect, and&#xD;
then retired, leaving ni  to face the evening&#xD;
as best I could.&#xD;
"I faced it very badly. Those anxious&#xD;
eyes of Edward Clavering's gazed at me from&#xD;
every page I attempted to read, anI that&#xD;
white, set face of his, seemed to lurk in the&#xD;
shadows that gathered about the corners of&#xD;
the room. I was heartily glad when nine&#xD;
o'clock struck, and Iwas free to go to bed&#xD;
without feeling ashamed of myself for keep-&#xD;
ing 'poultry-hours.' I rang for my maid, and&#xD;
astonished her by saying that I would sleep&#xD;
in papa's room, ajid that ~he might bring my&#xD;
toilet apparatus down to that apartment,&#xD;
which was on the ground-floor. I must do&#xD;
myself the justice to say that some vaguely.&#xD;
heroic idea of protecting the jewels was in&#xD;
my head, though I scarcely think it would&#xD;
have availed to make me change my domicile,&#xD;
if a very clear and unheroic idea of being&#xD;
protected by John-the dining-room was just&#xD;

across the hall from papa's room-bad not&#xD;
aided and abetted it.&#xD;
"Now you must understand that, in the&#xD;
original plan of the house, papa's room had&#xD;
been meant for a smoking-den, but he pre-&#xD;
ferred a chamber on the ground-floor, and so&#xD;
had chosen this apartment, for which he said&#xD;
there was 'no rational use.' It had two doors,&#xD;
one opening on the hail, the other on a side-&#xD;
piazza, from which a path led 'stableward.&#xD;
Both of these doors had locks; and the ease&#xD;
with which any ordinary lock gives way at&#xD;
the ยฃ open-sesame' touch of professional 'fin-&#xD;
gers was at that time a fact which had never&#xD;
been brought to the realization of the rustic&#xD;
mind. I remember looking round, after I was&#xD;
in bed, and thinking how secure every thing&#xD;
wag-the doors safely locked, the shutters&#xD;
closed with springs,, and not an avenue of&#xD;
entrance left by which a mouse could profit.&#xD;
I gazed with complacent gratulation at the&#xD;
safe at the farther end of the room-the safe&#xD;
sitting modestly back in a corner, and giving&#xD;
no sign of the golden treasure within it-as I&#xD;
thought how emphatically we were burglar-&#xD;
proof. Nevertheless, seeing the firelight&#xD;
gleam on a digger of papa's-a pretty, fan.&#xD;
czfnl~ Albanian trifle, which he had picked up&#xD;
in some of his Eastern rambles-I thought I&#xD;
might as well put it within convenient reach,&#xD;
so springing out of bed, I ran across the&#xD;
floor, and took it down from its place over&#xD;
the mantel. I remember distinctly how I&#xD;
felt its cold, keen edge as I went back; then,&#xD;
slipping it under my pillow, I extinguished&#xD;
the light and dropped comfortably into sleep.&#xD;
"I do not know how long I slept, but I&#xD;
.think it was about midnight when I waked&#xD;
sud4enl~ with a strange sense of terror, a&#xD;
Wind instinct of danger, 'which made the&#xD;
blood settle like ice around my heart. My&#xD;
senses dl~ not, as is usually the case, strug-&#xD;
gle In the dim border-land between sleep and&#xD;
~vaklng, but I was roused to perfect con-&#xD;
scIousness in an instant-consciousness as&#xD;
complete and clear as that which I enjoy at&#xD;
this moment. As well as I can recollect, my&#xD;
flr~t physical impression was of a strange&#xD;
heaviness, together with a subtle odor which&#xD;
I knew perfectly, yet could not identify.&#xD;
When I lifted a little the lids which seemed&#xD;
held down by some indefinable weight, Isaw&#xD;
that a light was in the chamber, and that a&#xD;
man, wearing a black mask, held a bottle of&#xD;
chloroform to my nostrils, while another, also&#xD;
&#xD;
masked, knelt l~efore the safe at the farther&#xD;
end of the room.&#xD;
"You wonder, perhaps, that I did not&#xD;
faint, realizing my utter helplessness. I have&#xD;
sometimes wondered myself; but the truth is,&#xD;
that we rarely give way under pressure of&#xD;
great emergencies. On the contrary, I think&#xD;
we hardly know our own capabilities until we&#xD;
have been tried in some such manner. I&#xD;
closed my eyes after that one glance, and lay&#xD;
perfectly motionless, feeling instinctively that&#xD;
to feign unconsciousness was the only re-&#xD;
source, the only hope in such peril as this.&#xD;
There was nothing to be done. To move, to&#xD;
attempt to cry aloud, was to seal my death-&#xD;
warrant, for the same hand which was hold-&#xD;
ing the chloroform to my nostril could have&#xD;
been on my throat before more than a gurgle&#xD;
had been uttered. I did not move a muscle,&#xD;
therefore; I even regulated my breathing to&#xD;
simulate the soft uniformity of slumber. You&#xD;
think you could not have done as much?"&#xD;
(A murmur had risen from the audience here.)&#xD;
"Take my word for it, the most timid woman&#xD;
here would have done just as I did. You see&#xD;
there was no alternative. Death hung over&#xD;
me on a hair, and in mortal peril it is said&#xD;
that even cowards are bcrave. With all my&#xD;
acting, my heart beat so madly that I feared&#xD;
it would betray me, and there are no words&#xD;
to tell what agonizing thoughts were mean-&#xD;
while surging in my brain. I knew that with&#xD;
every breath I inhaled tbe powerful anms-&#xD;
thetic, and the terror of . unconsciousness&#xD;
grew momently greater. What could I do?&#xD;
0 God! what could I do? I remember think-&#xD;
ing little besides this while I lay motion-&#xD;
less.&#xD;
"I lived an age of horror in the few min-&#xD;
utes that elapsed after my waking, until the&#xD;
voice of the burglar who was forcing the safe&#xD;
said something-so low and muffled that I did&#xD;
not catch it-~--which summoned his companion&#xD;
to him. I felt that the latter hesitated a mo-&#xD;
ment and looked at me. Then, as I supposed,&#xD;
concluding that I was 'safe,' he withdrew the&#xD;
bottle; the next instant a handkerchief, satu-&#xD;
rated in the chloroform, was laid across my&#xD;
mouth and nose - after which, with light,&#xD;
stealthy steps, he moved away.&#xD;
"I heard it all, with senses sharpened to&#xD;
tenfold their usual acuteness; and, when he&#xD;
was once safely gone, I moved the handker-&#xD;
chief slightly-just enough to allow me a little&#xD;
pure air, instead of the stifling fumes of the&#xD;

chloroform-and then I asked myself; wildly&#xD;
and desperately, if there was nothing I could&#xD;
do-if bitter necessity compelled me to lie&#xD;
there and watch this daring robbery without&#xD;
lifting a hand to protect the property intrusted&#xD;
to my father's honor. You will say that such&#xD;
a question, in my position, was utter madness,&#xD;
and so it would have seemed to me at any&#xD;
other time. But at that moment I forgot my&#xD;
weakness, my utter helplessness, in the burn.&#xD;
ing sense of outrage which came over me as&#xD;
strongly as if I had been a very Samson.&#xD;
Watching the two burglars from under my&#xD;
eyelids, I saw the door of the safe (which was,&#xD;
in truth, little more thitn a strong box) yield&#xD;
to their efforts, and swing back. Was there&#xD;
nothing I could ~o, I asked myself again, in&#xD;
.utter despair-anti, as I asked it, I thought of&#xD;
the dagger under my pillow!&#xD;
"I say that I thought of it, but I need&#xD;
scarcely ad~ that an instant's consideration&#xD;
told me that no possible weapon could make&#xD;
me a match for two men, even if desperation&#xD;
lent me courage enough to face them. Still I&#xD;
put up my hand very softly, and drew the&#xD;
dagger from under my pillow-there being&#xD;
something singularly reassuring in the cold&#xD;
steel of its blade. It astonishes me yet to re-&#xD;
member how cool I was all this time-so cool&#xD;
that I was sure my hand would not tremble if&#xD;
the safety of my life ekotdd depend upon one&#xD;
stroke of the poniard which I grasped as my&#xD;
only friend and refuge. I was naturally anx-&#xD;
ions to avoid any such unequal contest-both&#xD;
for my own sake, and that of the men whom I&#xD;
could not help remembering soere men, with&#xD;
souls to be sent Into eternity. I was, how-&#xD;
ever, determined to save the jewels if possi-&#xD;
ble; and, strange as it may seem, a plan of es-&#xD;
cape at last suggested itself to me-a reckless&#xD;
plan enough, as you may judge. As I have&#xD;
said, the safe was at the other end of the&#xD;
room from the bed, and the two burglars, in&#xD;
stooping over it, had turned their backs on&#xD;
me. The door leading into the hall was mid-&#xD;
way between the two ends of the room. If I&#xD;
could once reach it unubserved, I could escape&#xD;
and give the alarm.&#xD;
"It was a forlorn hope, but I determined&#xD;
to try it. Perhaps I should not have ventured&#xD;
to do so if I had not been certain of at least&#xD;
one ally the moment I opened the door. This&#xD;
was a large mastiff, named Caesar. He was a&#xD;
great favorite with papa, and always. slept on&#xD;
I&#xD;
a mat in the hall. His instinct told him that&#xD;

I had heard him scratching and whining at&#xD;
the door. Once aroused, I knew that no bull-&#xD;
dog could surpass him for strength, no blood-&#xD;
hound for ferocity, and so-if the worst came&#xD;
to the worst after the door was opened-I&#xD;
knew that C~esar was certainly good for one&#xD;
burglar, and perhaps-if God gave me quick-&#xD;
ness and strength when both were needed-I&#xD;
and my dagger might be good for another.&#xD;
"Chance, and the absorbed preoccupation&#xD;
of the two men, favored me. One short&#xD;
prayer-how fervent you can never tell unless&#xD;
you are placed in some such strait--and, step.&#xD;
ping out of bed with the dagger in my hand,&#xD;
I took the first steps, in my bare feet, on the&#xD;
thickly-carpeted floor. They did not notice&#xD;
me. All around them were gleaming masses&#xD;
of plate and jewelry. I crossed the floor&#xD;
swiftly, noiselessly, and with perfect safety.&#xD;
But, when my hand touched tke lock of the&#xD;
door, it gave a sharp click, which made them&#xD;
both start and turn. A single glance was&#xD;
enough. With an oath I shall never ~'orget,&#xD;
one of them strode toward mc.&#xD;
"Don't expect me to describe the scene&#xD;
that followed-I could not, if my life de~&#xD;
ended on it. I only know that, before I&#xD;
could unfasten the door, I was in the grasp&#xD;
of a man, whose hands might have been made&#xD;
of iron from the manner in which they caught&#xD;
me, ~nd the manner in which I felt them in&#xD;
every fibre. The vast majority of women.(in&#xD;
our class of life) go to their graves without&#xD;
ever having had cause to realize the brute&#xD;
dominion of man-when he chooses to use the&#xD;
strength given him by his Maker-over the&#xD;
frail phyaique of woman. In those days I was&#xD;
young, healthy, well developed, and somewhat&#xD;
vain of my strength; yet I was like a reed in&#xD;
that man's hands. Not even despair and&#xD;
loathing horror could give me energy enough&#xD;
to free myself from a grasp which felt as ifW&#xD;
might crush every bone in my body. Half&#xD;
suffocated as I was, I had power, however, to&#xD;
raise my voice and give one cry-the utter-&#xD;
ance of mortal extremity and terror. In a&#xD;
second a hand was over my mouth, and an-&#xD;
other at my throat. 'Try that again, and you&#xD;
are a dead woman in two minutes I' the bin,.&#xD;
glar hissed in my ear. The close grip on my&#xD;
throat rendered this more than a threat, and&#xD;
an instinct-the instinct that causes even the&#xD;
weakest to fight forilfe-mademe lift the hand&#xD;
which was now free, and plunge the dagger&#xD;

THE STORY OF A SCAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
(which he had been on the point of wresting&#xD;
from me When I screamed) up to the hilt in&#xD;
his body!&#xD;
"He dropped his hands from my throat,&#xD;
and, with one deep groan, staggered back.&#xD;
As he did so, I turned, and, with wildly-ex-&#xD;
cited fingers, tore open the door. Then, with&#xD;
a deep, menacing growl, such as I never&#xD;
heard before, and hope never to hear again,&#xD;
Caesar rushed past me. I heard cries.-.oaths&#xD;
-the sound of fierce struggling-the deep&#xD;
bass muster of the dog-as I fled from the&#xD;
room, but I dared not pause, and bursting&#xD;
into the dining-room, I faced John, whom my&#xD;
scream and the noise of the dog had at last&#xD;
aroused.&#xD;
"In a few minutes the only other man of&#xD;
the establishment-..the gardener-.--was wak-&#xD;
ened; and, armed with any available weapons&#xD;
that came to hand, the two men entered the&#xD;
now ominously silent room. Despite their&#xD;
entreaties, I followed them, and-shall I ever&#xD;
forget the scene* which greeted me! There&#xD;
was the open safe, with a lantern on the floor&#xD;
beside it, the light flashing back from all the&#xD;
shining plate and dazzling jewels, which cov-&#xD;
ered the carpet. Near the door-.-within five&#xD;
paces of where I had stood-lay the burglar&#xD;
who had caught me; and near the safe---with&#xD;
Cmsar crouching on his chest.-...was the other.&#xD;
The two servants went at once to draw off the&#xD;
dog, and, while they did this, I bent to see if&#xD;
the mau near me were dead or only wounded.&#xD;
I found that he was still living, though he had&#xD;
evidently tried to rise, and fainted from pain&#xD;
or loss of blood. Anxious to give him air&#xD;
sufficient for recovery, I lifted the crape mask&#xD;
from his face, and, as God sees and hears me,&#xD;
this midnight vobber....-this thief whom I had&#xD;
stabbed as an outlaw, in self-defence~--proved&#xD;
to be no other than Edward Clavering, my&#xD;
father's constant guest, my own devoted&#xD;
lover!&#xD;
"I knelt over him as if I had been turned&#xD;
to stone-.-striving vainly to realize the hide-&#xD;
ous horror of the discovery.-~when a stifled&#xD;
cry frofa John fell on my ear.&#xD;
"'Good God!' I heard him exclaim.&#xD;
'Sandy', here's Mr. Ridgeley-and its's stone&#xD;
deadl'&#xD;
"They say that afterthis I uttered a cry.-.&#xD;
the second which had passed my lips-and&#xD;
fell back into a deep swoon. I only know&#xD;
that those words are the last I remember of&#xD;
that hideous night."&#xD;
&#xD;
There was silence with the quai~tet for&#xD;
some time after Mrs. Stuart reached this&#xD;
tragic climax of her story; but, to make it&#xD;
satisfactorily complete, there was more yet to&#xD;
be told; and, after waiting as long as was&#xD;
possible, Miss Palmer at last hazarded a ques-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"Was he quite dead, Mrs. Stuart?"&#xD;
Yes," answered Mrs. Stuart, speaking&#xD;
with great effort. "Casar had done his work&#xD;
well. The wretched man never breathed af-&#xD;
ter those strong teeth were once fastened in&#xD;
his throat. Edward Clavering, however, re-&#xD;
covered, and, although I never saw him after-&#xD;
ward, papa told me' that he had confessed&#xD;
every thing with regard to himself and his mo-&#xD;
tives. The whole family were adventurers,&#xD;
and he was-as Harry had declared-.--a pro-&#xD;
fessional gambler. and eltevatier d'indusfrie.&#xD;
Fortune had for some time been at a very low&#xD;
ebb with him, and to marry me was his last&#xD;
hope bf retrieving his affairs. One or two&#xD;
people who knew his character had, however,&#xD;
chanced to come into the neighborhood of the&#xD;
county, and he was aware that exposure&#xD;
might overtake him any day or hour. Under&#xD;
these circumstances he grew desperate; and,&#xD;
knowing that there was very little hope of my&#xD;
father's consenting to the marriage (even if I&#xD;
should accept his proposal), he determined&#xD;
upon the bold stroke of 'securing' Mrs. Ha:-&#xD;
die's jewels. The plan had presented itself&#xD;
to him when he heard of my father's absence,&#xD;
and it was to facilitate the matter that he had&#xD;
urged me so strongly to leave the house. It&#xD;
was also on this account that he had brought&#xD;
matters to a decided issue with regard to his&#xD;
suit. lie had always distrusted the marks of&#xD;
favor which I accorded to him; for my repu-&#xD;
tation as a coquette was wide-spread, and he&#xD;
had no idea of giving up a certain good (the&#xD;
jewels) for the uncertain good of being played&#xD;
with a little longer by an accomplished flirt.&#xD;
Still, if I had not been so decided-if I had&#xD;
given him any hope of my eventually saying&#xD;
'Yes '.-every thing might have been differ-&#xD;
ent. The unfortunate Ridgeley would not&#xD;
have been led to his death, and the exposure&#xD;
when it came would not have been so open&#xD;
and so terrible. One thing, however, is cer-&#xD;
tain: his purpose would have been safely&#xD;
achieved-.-the jewels would have been lost,&#xD;
and royfather's fortune, If not credit, serious-&#xD;
ly impaired, but for my whim of sleeping&#xD;
down-stairs. I alone had the credit of pre.&#xD;

venting the robbery, and it was not until I&#xD;
waked from my long and death-like swoon&#xD;
that I found at how much cost to myself&#xD;
this credit had been gained. I was ill-I re-&#xD;
mained ill for weeks-and this hand" (she&#xD;
held up the one across the white surface of&#xD;
which the long, red scar was traced) "had&#xD;
been laid open to the bone by the keen edge&#xD;
of the dagger to which I clung in that short,&#xD;
close struggle.&#xD;
"Was I cured of flirting? I think I may&#xD;
safely say that I was; but I never married&#xD;
Harry Wilinot, though we were good friends&#xD;
and cousins to the day of his death. In this&#xD;
respect, at least, you see, the whole course of&#xD;
my life was changed by the story I have told&#xD;
you."&#xD;
The steady voice of the narrator sank into&#xD;
silence, the bright blaze of the fire had died&#xD;
down to a spft glow which did little more than&#xD;
reveal faint outlines of the four ladies grouped&#xD;
around it, and, as the gloom of twilight deep.&#xD;
ened into night, the large room looked almost&#xD;
eerie enough for a ghost-scene. The tragic&#xD;
narrative to which they had just listened had&#xD;
sobered the audience exceedingly, and no&#xD;
voice broke the stillness until there came&#xD;
sounds-footsteps and voices on the stair-&#xD;
which told that the gentlemen were coming&#xD;
up. Then there was something of a commo-&#xD;
tion. Mrs. Dulaney rang for lights, Miss&#xD;
Palmer's pretty feet resumed their proper&#xD;
place on the floor, Miss Lamar rose from her&#xD;
lowly seat, and sank into a deep chair some-&#xD;
what outside the circle and in the shade;&#xD;
Here a tall, handsome gentleman found her&#xD;
when he glanced round eagerly for his "nut-&#xD;
brown mayde."&#xD;
&#xD;
OF A SCAR.                         155~&#xD;
"Why are you looking so pensive?" he&#xD;
asked, leaning over the back of her chair.&#xD;
"Have you been frightening each other with&#xD;
ghost.stories here in the dark?"&#xD;
She threw her head back and looked up at&#xD;
him with her liquid-brown eyes. Wretched&#xD;
little sinner that she was, shq~ knew only too&#xD;
well how these same eyes w&amp;amp;e treacherous&#xD;
lakes into the depths of which men's hearts&#xD;
tumbled unawares and were heard of no more.&#xD;
"Ghost-stories?" she repeated. "No,&#xD;
indeed! We have had something much moro&#xD;
thrilling than a ghost-story, because it was&#xD;
true-a story of robbery, and danger, and&#xD;
courage, and death! With a moral, too!"&#xD;
"Indeed! And may I ask what the moral&#xD;
was ?-to get patent locks, and keep fire-arms&#xD;
by your bed 2&#xD;
"No. The moral was less commonplace&#xD;
-at least in connection with robbery. It was~&#xD;
highly edifying, I assure you, for it was this&#xD;
-beware of flirtation!"&#xD;
He elevated his eyebrows and laughed.&#xD;
"Is it possible? I think I shall beg for&#xD;
the story, for I cannot imagine two more in-&#xD;
congruous ideas than burglary and flirtation.&#xD;
And are we to have a feminine Saul among&#xD;
the prophets-do you mean to swear off from&#xD;
your favorite amusement?"&#xD;
"Swear off! As if I ever flirted! or, as&#xD;
if my poor shots could hurt anybody, if I&#xD;
did~"&#xD;
"Don't lay that'flattering unction to your&#xD;
soul,'" said he, in a whisper. "Your shots&#xD;
have crippled one bird for life, and Heaven&#xD;
only knows what you mean to do with him."&#xD;
"Put him in my game-bag, of course,"'&#xD;
she answered, with a wicked glance.&#xD;

CHAPTER 1.&#xD;
T HE day was bright, still, and balmy.&#xD;
Though January had told but a third&#xD;
of his span of days, Nature was already be-&#xD;
ginning to awake from her winter~ sleep.&#xD;
Flowers were blooming, bees were humming,&#xD;
and birds were singing gayly amid the ever-&#xD;
green shrubs, in the large garden attached to&#xD;
one of the handsomest private residences in&#xD;
the town of J-. All was sunny and cheer-&#xD;
ful without doors; all was bustle and excite-&#xD;
ment within. It was the eve of the wedding-&#xD;
day of the only child and heiress of the&#xD;
house, and, in anticipation of the important&#xD;
event, all heads and hands were busy with&#xD;
preparations.&#xD;
Mrs. Blount, the lady of the mansion, was&#xD;
a little too busy for the comfort of her ser-&#xD;
vants and assistants. $he was here, there,&#xD;
everywhere; in the store-room, where the&#xD;
process of cake-making, cake-decorating, and&#xD;
the general manufacture of domestic confec-&#xD;
tions, was in full tide-up-stairs, down-stairs-&#xD;
even in the kitchen, with iluestions, sugges-&#xD;
tions, directions, that infinitely disgusted the&#xD;
cook-hindering everybody, helping nobody,&#xD;
until the very rustle of her silk dress be-&#xD;
came an abomination in the ears of the much-&#xD;
tried household. The confectioner's man,&#xD;
who was in command of the storeroom, had&#xD;
again and again respectfully represented that&#xD;
he "would have all right, without her troub-&#xD;
ling herself-she might depend upon thoU"&#xD;
-the cook had exclaimed each time that the&#xD;
brown silk invaded her domain, "Now don't&#xD;
you be botherin', mistiss, and n~aking yourself&#xD;
uneasy. You know I'm boutsd to have every&#xD;
thing fust-rate for Miss Emmy's wedding'&#xD;
&#xD;
breakfast ! "-and her own maid had protest.&#xD;
ed solemnly against her "breaking herself&#xD;
down this way, instead of keeping quiet, so&#xD;
as to be well to-morrow." But remonstrances&#xD;
were vain. Mrs. Blount could not keep quiet.&#xD;
Her spirits were, at that altitude of exhila-&#xD;
ration which must effervesce in restless mo-&#xD;
tion. It was not only that she enjoyed in-&#xD;
tensely the fuss, excitement, and ~clat of her&#xD;
daughter's marriage with one of the richest,&#xD;
handsomest, and most fashionable men of&#xD;
J-; the crown of her content was, that&#xD;
she herself had "made the match;" that, but&#xD;
for her, it "never would have been a match."&#xD;
And so, happy and self- congratulating, she&#xD;
wantlered about, blandly unconscious of how&#xD;
much she was in everybody's way, and how&#xD;
heartily everybody was wishing her at the an-&#xD;
tipodes.&#xD;
There were two rooms in the house, how-&#xD;
ever, which, in all her wanderings, she left un-&#xD;
invaded. One of these was the chamber of&#xD;
her daughter, the bride-elect; the other was&#xD;
the private room of her husband-a small&#xD;
apartment adjoining the library-which en-&#xD;
joyed the prescriptive right of exemption&#xD;
from intrusion.&#xD;
In this latter, Mr Blount was now sitting,&#xD;
on a sofa drawn near to the fire. He had&#xD;
just turned from the library-table at his el-&#xD;
bow, where he had been writing letters, and,&#xD;
leaning forward, took up the poker, and be-&#xD;
gan to stir the fire mechanically. Mr. Blount&#xD;
was a man whose life was exclusively of thb&#xD;
world. He ate, he slept, he entertained his&#xD;
friends, he read, wrote, and studied, under his&#xD;
own roof, and he paid all the bills his wife&#xD;
presented to him, without question or com-&#xD;
ment; but that.was all. So far as any of the&#xD;

A DOUBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
usual influences of home were concerned, he&#xD;
might as well have been the celibate of an&#xD;
anchored's cell. He had early in his married&#xD;
life discovered that there was nothing in&#xD;
common between himself and the vain, friv-&#xD;
olous woman whom he had made his wife;&#xD;
for, though the world occupied an equal place&#xD;
in her regard as in his own, it was in a very&#xD;
different form. He was intellectual, energet-&#xD;
ic, ambitious, while she was a mere butterfly&#xD;
of fashion; far the more selfish and heartless,&#xD;
inasmuch as she was by far the moet shallow&#xD;
nature of the two.&#xD;
On the present family occasion, there was&#xD;
as little harmony of sentiment as usual be-&#xD;
tween this ill-matched pair. As Mr. ]llount&#xD;
bent over, and absentlystirred the eoais, hi~&#xD;
face, so far from exhibiting the expression of&#xD;
beatified content which his wife's counte-&#xD;
Sr nanee was bearing about, was very clouded.&#xD;
His eye was thoughtful, his brows somewhat&#xD;
-contracted, and his lips compressed. He was&#xD;
thinking of an appeal which his daughter, to&#xD;
his great astonishment, had addressed. to him&#xD;
the night before; and, as he thought, his&#xD;
face grew darker and darker for he felt&#xD;
that, without any fault of his own, he occu-&#xD;
pied a very embarrassing and painful posi-&#xD;
tion; and the sense of this was not less dis-&#xD;
agreeable than novel to him. He had prom-&#xD;
ised his daughter that be would consider the&#xD;
matter which she had so abruptly forced upon&#xD;
his attention, and he had kept his word'-.&#xD;
baying spent the greater part of the night&#xD;
revolving it in his mind. But, look at the&#xD;
question as he would, he could find no satis-&#xD;
factory solution of the difficulty. For once,&#xD;
his keen intellect, and usual fertility of re-&#xD;
source, were entirely at fault. He was hope-&#xD;
lessly perplexed.&#xD;
While he was still ruminating the subject,&#xD;
there was a low knock at the door. He&#xD;
hesitated a moment before he said, "Come&#xD;
in," and, for the first time in his life, was&#xD;
conscious of a positive sense of cowardice, as&#xD;
he heard the door open and shut, and a slight,&#xD;
quick step crossing the floor. It was not un-&#xD;
til this step paused beside him, that he turned&#xD;
and looked up.&#xD;
A young girl, whose slender figure and&#xD;
delicate blond beauty gave her an almost&#xD;
painful appearance of fragility, was standing&#xD;
with feverishly-varying color, her eager gaze&#xD;
fastened upon him. At the first glimpse of&#xD;
his countenance, she seemed to read the do-&#xD;
&#xD;
vision at that instant forming in hi&amp;amp; mind,&#xD;
and the lovely half-blushes, that were coming&#xD;
and going momently in her cheek, faded sud-&#xD;
denly, leaving it as stony white as freshly.&#xD;
carved alabaster.&#xD;
"Papa, 0 papa!" she cried, without wait-&#xD;
ing for him to speak, "I cannot, cannot mar-&#xD;
ry him! Oh, have mercy on me, and send&#xD;
him away! I cannot, cannot marry him!"&#xD;
She pressed her hands down one upon&#xD;
the other, on the edge of the table by which&#xD;
she stood~ as if to steady herself-for she was&#xD;
trembling from head to foot-pressed them so&#xD;
hard, that they were almost as bloodless as&#xD;
her face; and there was a strange look of&#xD;
terror and anguish in her eyes, while her&#xD;
voice had the very wail of despair in its ac-&#xD;
cents.&#xD;
"My daughter," said Mr. Blount, gravely&#xD;
.-taking her hands, he drew her toward him,&#xD;
and placed her on the sofa by his side-" my&#xD;
daughter, sit down and listen to what I have&#xD;
to say."&#xD;
"0 papa! 0 papa!" she gasped hyster-&#xD;
ically, "you do not mean-you cannot be so&#xD;
cruel as to mean-."&#xD;
"Don't excite yourself in this violent&#xD;
manner,,' said her father, whose face had be-&#xD;
come a shade paler than usual. "Try and&#xD;
control this agitation-try and listen to me,&#xD;
Emily."&#xD;
He was still holding her hands, but by&#xD;
a sudden effort she released them from&#xD;
his grasp, and began wringing them franti-&#xD;
cally.&#xD;
"Tell me-only tell me," she cried, "that&#xD;
you will save me from this worse than death!&#xD;
That is all I ask!"&#xD;
"I can tell you nothing until you are capa-&#xD;
ble of listening to reason, my daughter," he&#xD;
answered, with the samegentle gravity as when&#xD;
he spoke first.&#xD;
"Reason!" exclaimed she, passionately.&#xD;
Then looking at his face, and reading its ex-&#xD;
pression, she added n~ore quietly: "Forgive&#xD;
me for distressing you so much! I will try to&#xD;
listen to you."&#xD;
He put his hand on We soft brown hair&#xD;
that was pushed carelessly back from her&#xD;
face, flowing in disordered ringlets on her&#xD;
shoulders, and smoothed 5t softly for a mo-&#xD;
ment, before he said:&#xD;
"Emily, if you had told, rue, at the time&#xD;
this marriage was first spoken of, that in ac-&#xD;
cepting Madison you were acting under com-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
A DOUBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
pulsioa of your mother's influence, I should&#xD;
not only have at once put a stop to the affair&#xD;
itself, but I should have taken care that such a&#xD;
thing never happened again, by peremptorily&#xD;
forbidding your mother's interference, either&#xD;
one way or the other, with your future matri-&#xD;
monial choice. But I understood from her&#xD;
that you accepted him voluntarily; and your&#xD;
conduct gave every color of probability to&#xD;
this assertion. I saw you walking and riding&#xD;
with him constantly-receiving his attentions&#xD;
at all times, as if they were agreeable to you;&#xD;
and when I made the direct inquiry of you-&#xD;
as a matter of form only, I confess-.-whether&#xD;
you wished to marry the man, you answered&#xD;
distinctly that you did."&#xD;
"Yes, yes, I was a poor, miserable coward!&#xD;
As I told you last night, papa, mamma man-&#xD;
aged to throw me with-with him , against my&#xD;
will, and to commit me in so many different&#xD;
ways, that I was coward enough to feel it im-&#xD;
possible to say no, when he finally asked me&#xD;
to marry him. But as to my receiving his&#xD;
attentions, that was not my fault. Mamma&#xD;
would promise him that I would ride or walk&#xD;
with him at a certain time, and would&#xD;
then insist on my fulfilling the engagement&#xD;
when he came to claim it. I never liked him&#xD;
-though I did not, when I consented to mar-&#xD;
ry him, detest him as I do now. I thought&#xD;
that as I had unintentionally led him on, as&#xD;
mamma called it, to offer himself-that I&#xD;
would try to like him. And, 0 papa, I have&#xD;
tried so hard! But the more I saw of him,&#xD;
the more did I feel dislike, amounting to ut-&#xD;
ter disgust; and though for a long time I&#xD;
would not acknowledge this, even to myself,&#xD;
as the time drew nearer and nearer for me&#xD;
to marry him, I-I---papa, I could not endure&#xD;
it! I abhor him-I loathe him! Death would&#xD;
be a thousand times preferable to marrying&#xD;
him I 0 papa! have mercy on me, and save&#xD;
me! I shall lose my senses or die, if I&#xD;
have to marry this man!"&#xD;
"What can I do at this late hour? Con-&#xD;
sider, Emily-if you had spoken to me a&#xD;
month or even a week ago, it would have&#xD;
been different; but yoi let the engagement&#xD;
go on for months, you wait until the marriage&#xD;
has been publicly announced, every prepara-&#xD;
ti9n completed, the very eve of the day ar-&#xD;
rives, and you wish to break it off thou!&#xD;
Don't you know that to jilt the man in this&#xD;
notorious manner would be most unprincipled,&#xD;
nios&amp;amp;dishonorable conduct?"&#xD;
&#xD;
159&#xD;
&#xD;
She did not answer. She only wrung her&#xD;
hands again, with a look of utter de-&#xD;
spair.&#xD;
"Do not think that I am indifferent to&#xD;
your wishes," continued Mr. Blount, after a&#xD;
little pause. "I would do any thing which it&#xD;
was possible to do, my daughter, to release&#xD;
you from a marriage that seems so repugnant&#xD;
to your inclination. But what you propose&#xD;
would be a disgraceful breach of faith. Don't&#xD;
you see that?"&#xD;
"Is there no hope, no help, for me?" she&#xD;
asked, with a desperate sort of calmness.&#xD;
"No help but in your own strength of&#xD;
character. Remember, it was by your own&#xD;
act that you were involved in this affair. A&#xD;
word to me, at any time, would have relieved&#xD;
you of all difficulty. You ought to have&#xD;
spoken that word in time. Since you did not&#xD;
do so, you are hound in honor to keep your&#xD;
faith."&#xD;
"I would have appealed to you sooner, but&#xD;
I was always afraid of you, father," said the&#xD;
girl; bitterly.&#xD;
"Afraid of me! What reason had you&#xD;
to be afraid of me?" demanded he, hastily.&#xD;
"Did I ever once act, or even speak, harshly&#xD;
to you?"&#xD;
"No; you were always kind enough, but&#xD;
so cold! You scarcely seemed conscious of&#xD;
my existence, unless some accident reminded&#xD;
you of it."&#xD;
"God forgive me!" said he, with a groan..&#xD;
"God forgive me! One false step, one error,.&#xD;
is the fruitful source of many succeeding evils~&#xD;
I was not by nature what is called an affec-&#xD;
tionate disposition, not impressionable or&#xD;
demonstrative, and the little warmth and&#xD;
sentiment that I did possess was frozen&#xD;
by-"&#xD;
He stopped, and was silent for some min-&#xD;
utes.&#xD;
"Emily," he said, turning suddenly to his&#xD;
daughter, "answer me one question. Is it&#xD;
some love - affair with another man which&#xD;
makes you so averse to marrying Madi-&#xD;
son?"&#xD;
"No," she answered, meeting his keen&#xD;
glance without the slightest hesitation. "I&#xD;
do not love any other man. I wish I did; for&#xD;
I could ask him to save me, then. No. It&#xD;
is just that I detest.-..loatke-this man!"&#xD;
She spoke quietly now, as if the climax&#xD;
of passionate feeling was past, and something&#xD;
very like apathy was stealing over her. Mr.&#xD;

Blount looked with anxiety amounting to ap-&#xD;
prehension at her pale face and drooping&#xD;
form.&#xD;
"My daughter,"( said he, abruptly, "you&#xD;
think the sacrifice which your own conduct&#xD;
has imposed upon you a hard one. Listen to&#xD;

fice wiiich I once made to a sense of honor.&#xD;
Did it ever occur to you to wonder, Emily,&#xD;
why I married your mother?"&#xD;
"I have always wondered at it," she an-&#xD;
swered, listlessly.&#xD;
"She was handsome when I first saw her,&#xD;
and much admired; and, from the first mo-&#xD;
ment of our acquaintance, she exerted every&#xD;
effort to attract me. I don't think that, in-&#xD;
trinsically considered, I should have given&#xD;
her a single thought, or that it would have&#xD;
been possible for her to obtain my most tran-&#xD;
sient attention. But I was young and vain,&#xD;
and, flattered by the favor voluntarily be-&#xD;
stowed on me-a favor which I saw so many&#xD;
around me coveting-I was unhappily drawn&#xD;
on, until, despite my better judgment, and&#xD;
almost before I knew what I was about, I was&#xD;
engaged to her.&#xD;
"It was at a watering-place that we met,&#xD;
just at the end of the season. On the very&#xD;
day after I had offered myself, and been ac-&#xD;
cepted, we parted to return to our respective&#xD;
homes. I was startled to find that, as I jour-&#xD;
neyed homeward, I dragged a lengthening&#xD;
chain, not of regret at parting from her, but&#xD;
of repentance that I had been so weak as to&#xD;
yield to a momentary infatuation, thus bind-&#xD;
ing myself in honor to marry a woman for&#xD;
whom I entertained not the slightest genuine&#xD;
regard. And, if I felt this at the time, how&#xD;
much more did I feel it afterward, when acci-&#xD;
dent threw across my path a woman whom I&#xD;
could have really loved, whom I did love, not-&#xD;
withstanding my struggles against what my&#xD;
own folly rendered a hopeless passion I But&#xD;
I did not hesitate, my daughter, as to what I&#xD;
should do. The real passion which had taken&#xD;
possession of my heart filled it with a dis-&#xD;
gust for the woman to whom I had engaged&#xD;
myself, equal, at least, to that which you en.&#xD;
certain for this man you are about to marry."&#xD;
The girl shivered at his last words. "But-&#xD;
I was bound in honor, and I kept my faith.&#xD;
Now, do you not see that my ease was harder&#xD;
'than your own? I loved another woman.&#xD;
You have just assured me that that sting is&#xD;
not added to your suffering. I was perfectly&#xD;
&#xD;
aware that it was only for my wealth, and my&#xD;
reputation as an ambitious and rising man,&#xD;
that the coquette who had netted me wished&#xD;
to become my wife; while you must acknowl-&#xD;
edge that Madison is really attached to you&#xD;
~for yourself alone. I do not admire him as a&#xD;
man; he certainly would not have been my&#xD;
choice as a son.in.law; but I must do him&#xD;
the justice to admit that his love for you is&#xD;
thoroughly honest and disinterested. I never&#xD;
was mistaken in my judgment of a man's&#xD;
character, and I am certain of this."&#xD;
"What does it matter? I hate him-I&#xD;
abhor him-I loathe him! Father" (she&#xD;
caught his arm with both her hands, and&#xD;
looked despairingly in his face), "do you&#xD;
mean to tell me that there is no escape, that&#xD;
I must marry him?"&#xD;
"My daughter cannot act dishonorably,&#xD;
and it would be dishonorable to draw back&#xD;
now."&#xD;
"Then, God help me, since you won't!"&#xD;
she cried, burying her face in her hands.&#xD;
After a minute, she slowly withdrew them,&#xD;
and looked up. "I am sorry I have dis-&#xD;
tressed you in this way, papa, since it has&#xD;
done no good. I suppose you are right-that&#xD;
every thing ought to be sacrificed to honor.&#xD;
I will try to be resigned, since it must be&#xD;
so."&#xD;
She rose to go, and her father, rising also,&#xD;
bent his head and pressed his lips to her&#xD;
brow.&#xD;
"My poor child!" he said.&#xD;
That was all; but she saw that hi~ eyes&#xD;
were full of tears.&#xD;
"Are you so sorry for me as that?" she&#xD;
said, with a sad, faint smile. And then she&#xD;
repeated her last words: "I will try to be&#xD;
resigned, since it must be so."&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
"What! not dressed yet?" said Mrs.&#xD;
Blount, sweeping into her daughter's room,&#xD;
resplendent in pearl-colored silk, early the&#xD;
~next morning, and finding Emily still in her&#xD;
dressing-gown, standing before a window. "I&#xD;
thought I particularly requested you to be&#xD;
punctual, my dear," she added, with petulant&#xD;
reproach.&#xD;
"I shall be ready in time," answered&#xD;
Emily, without turning round; and some-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
A DOUBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
thing in the tone of her voice grated very&#xD;
harshly on her mother's ear.&#xD;
She had managed and manoeuvred, with all&#xD;
the skill of a cunning and perfectly unscrupu-&#xD;
lous nature, to force her daughter into a mar-&#xD;
riage to which, she was well aware, the girl's&#xD;
inclinations were violently opposed; and she&#xD;
felicitated herself on the success of her man-&#xD;
agement. But still there was a little of the&#xD;
mother yet alive at the bottom of her heart,&#xD;
despite the mountain of selfishness overlying&#xD;
it; and latterly this feeling had given her&#xD;
some very uncomfortable qualms whenever&#xD;
she was in Emily's presence. The language&#xD;
of suffering was written so plainly on the pale&#xD;
and altered face, but a little time before so&#xD;
bright, that not all the specious arguments&#xD;
with which egotism is ever r~dy to justify&#xD;
itself to its worshipper vould quite stifle the&#xD;
whisperings of remorse. "I have acted en-&#xD;
tirely for her 1own good, and she will thank&#xD;
me for it hereafter," was the stereotyped&#xD;
phrase which she was in the habit of repeat-&#xD;
ing to herself when her conscience was a&#xD;
little more importunate than usual in con-&#xD;
demning her arbitrary conduct in the matter&#xD;
of this marriage. She repeated it now, as&#xD;
she advanced to where Emily remained stand-&#xD;
ing, and exclaimed, with ostentatious cheer-&#xD;
fulness:&#xD;
"Let me see if you are looking your best,&#xD;
my love, as in duty bound this morn-&#xD;
ing 1',&#xD;
Her daughter did not reply, did not even&#xD;
seem to hear the remark. She was gazing&#xD;
vacantly far away into the blue sky at some&#xD;
fleecy white clouds that floated slowly along,&#xD;
and wishing, in an apathetic sort of way, that&#xD;
she was one of them.&#xD;
"It is time that you were dressing," said&#xD;
Mrs. Blount, in somewhat less honeyed ac-&#xD;
cents, for she began to feel both irritated and&#xD;
uneasy at this strange manner.&#xD;
"Very well-I will dress," answered the&#xD;
girl, listlossly; but she made no movement&#xD;
toward doing so.&#xD;
"Never mind, Mrs. Blount; I will take&#xD;
her in hand, and, trust me, she shall be forth-&#xD;
coming at eleven o'clock," cried a gay voice&#xD;
in Mrs. Blount's rear; and a young lady in&#xD;
bridesmaid's costume 'came forward from the&#xD;
other side of the apartment, where she had&#xD;
been busy at a toilet-table, putting the finish-&#xD;
ing touches to her own dress.&#xD;
"Thank youMiss Laura-I will leave you&#xD;
11&#xD;
&#xD;
161&#xD;
&#xD;
to your task, then," said Mrs. Blount, grab&#xD;
ciously. "I am particularly anxious to be&#xD;
punctual to the appointed hour. It is always&#xD;
so tiresome and awkward when there is delay&#xD;
on an occasion of this kind."&#xD;
She smiled, and the pearl-colored silk rus-&#xD;
tled majestically out of the room.&#xD;
"Come, darling," said the young lady,&#xD;
who had so opportunely for Mrs. Blount en-&#xD;
tered an appearance on the scene-Emily's&#xD;
favorite friend and first bridesmaid-Laura&#xD;
Ashby-" come, you must dress."&#xD;
"Very well," was the reply again; and&#xD;
this time she did move.&#xD;
She walked across the room to the toilet-&#xD;
table, and resigned herself passively into the&#xD;
hands of Miss Ashby and her own maid, who&#xD;
went to work con amore, and, at least half an&#xD;
hour before the stipulated time, presented her&#xD;
to her own inspection in the mirror, in all the&#xD;
bridal glories of white silk, orange-blossoms,&#xD;
and veil, complete.&#xD;
"You look lovely, perfectly lovely I" cried&#xD;
Laura, enthusiastically. "A little too pale,&#xD;
but then it is the regulation thing for a bride&#xD;
to be pale-but beautiful as a dream I-Don't&#xD;
she, Lucinda?"&#xD;
"'Deed does she, Miss Laura," answered&#xD;
the maid, in a glow of pride and admiration.&#xD;
"The prettiest bride ever I saw!"&#xD;
"Run, now, and see whether all the bridal-&#xD;
party have arrived. I don't suppose they&#xD;
have; it is early yet. You wait down-stairs&#xD;
until it is time for us to go down, and come&#xD;
and tell me then.-You know," she continued,&#xD;
turning to Emily, as the maid left the ~oom,&#xD;
"that the guests are to be in the front draw-&#xD;
ing-room, and the folding-doors will remain&#xD;
closed until we are all in our places in the&#xD;
back drawing-room. Then they will be&#xD;
thrown open, and the ceremony performed&#xD;
immediately. That, and the congratulations,&#xD;
and the breakfast, will-but what am I think-&#xD;
[ug of to let you be standing tiring yourself&#xD;
in this way? Come to the fire, and be quiet&#xD;
antil we have to go down."&#xD;
"I would rather go to the window," said&#xD;
Rmily, returning to her former position.&#xD;
' Please to raise it up, Laura, I am so&#xD;
"It is a delightful morning," said Laura,&#xD;
mshing up the sash; "the air is more like&#xD;
&amp;amp;pril than January." She drew a large arm-&#xD;
~hair directly in front of the window as she&#xD;
~poke, and made her friend sit down. "Don't&#xD;
&#xD;

<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC8067-00000084"/>&#xD;
162                        A DOUBT.                                                                   A DOUBT.                        163&#xD;
&#xD;
crush your dress, though," she entreated, as&#xD;
the other sank into its depths without any&#xD;
apparent recollection of that important con-&#xD;
sideration. "Mercy, child I you will ruin&#xD;
your head if you lean back against it in that&#xD;
way."&#xD;
Emily looked up with a faint smile.&#xD;
"You can set it to rights again," she&#xD;
said. "I must lean back; I am so very&#xD;
tired."&#xD;
She closed her eyes, and Laura, who had&#xD;
been wondering privately all the morning at&#xD;
the strange manner in which she was acting,&#xD;
stood gazing at her now in positive dismay.&#xD;
Everybody-that is, everybody who con-&#xD;
stituted the fashionable world of J-, was&#xD;
perfectly aware that this marriage of Mr.&#xD;
Madison and Miss Blount was a "made&#xD;
match;" everybody, excepting Mr. Illount,&#xD;
who was not in the way of hearing gossip,&#xD;
particularly about his own daughter, had&#xD;
known all along that it was a match not at all&#xD;
to the taste of the bride; and she had been&#xD;
very much pitied at first. But people took&#xD;
it for granted that she had "become recon-&#xD;
ciled to the affair," and it was with a sudden&#xD;
thrill that Laura Ashby now connected her&#xD;
singular conduct with the recollection of her&#xD;
aversion to the marriage.&#xD;
"Good Heavens 1" thought she, aghast;&#xD;
and she went and sat down by the fire to&#xD;
think thematter over.&#xD;
A thousand little circumstances unnoticed&#xD;
at the time of their occurrence started up to&#xD;
corroborate the dreadful suspicion which had&#xD;
flashed upon her mind; and she was wringing&#xD;
her hands, metaphorically, over the miserable&#xD;
fate to which her poor friend was condemned,&#xD;
when the door opened, and a troop of brides-&#xD;
maids were ushered in by Lucintla.&#xD;
After exchanging a few sentences with&#xD;
Laura, they all followed her with gay words&#xD;
and laughter to offer their greetings to the&#xD;
bride, who still sat just as Laura had left her&#xD;
a few minutes before.&#xD;
"She is asleep," whispered the first one&#xD;
who approached; and the rest moved softly,&#xD;
and spoke in low tones as they gathered&#xD;
around the chair.&#xD;
"How lovely she looks 1"&#xD;
"Beantiful!"&#xD;
"Exquisite!"&#xD;
"Too pale!"&#xD;
"Oh, she will have color when she be-&#xD;
comes excited!"&#xD;
&#xD;
Suddenly a silence fell over the circle-&#xD;
the silence of unconscious awe. She was so&#xD;
still. They looked at each other in surprise;&#xD;
then chill doubt and terror came into their&#xD;
eyes, and they stood paralyzed.&#xD;
It was at this moment that Lucinda ap-&#xD;
proached the group, and, struck by the ex-&#xD;
pression of all the faces before her, she&#xD;
pressed forward, as with an instinct of what&#xD;
was to come, gazed for an instant with start-&#xD;
ing eyes, then seized one of the white hands&#xD;
that hung loosely over the arm of the chair.&#xD;
A touch was sufficient. She fell on her knees&#xD;
before the motionless form, with a loud, pier-&#xD;
cing shriek that rang through the whole&#xD;
house, smote fearfully on the ears of the wed-&#xD;
ding-guests assembled in the drawing-room&#xD;
beneath, and, in the contagious panic of hor-&#xD;
ror, was taken up and rei$choed by every one&#xD;
of the circle of girls around.&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
Emily Blount had watched the sun rise&#xD;
that morning of her wedding.day in golden&#xD;
splendor; but clouds gathered at early noon,&#xD;
and the same sun sank to his rest in gloom&#xD;
and darkness. When the next day dawned&#xD;
there seemed a shadow over the heavens as&#xD;
deep as the pall of grief that had fallen on&#xD;
the house so. suddenly changed from a house&#xD;
of joy to a house of mourning. The sky was&#xD;
one sombre gray; the air was still and damp.&#xD;
People who professed to understand the&#xD;
weather said that a heavy winter storm was&#xD;
coming on, which would last for days. There&#xD;
were speculations whether Emily Blount's&#xD;
funeral would not, or ought not, to take place&#xD;
that afternoon, as the weather was so threat-&#xD;
ening, the cemetery was a mile from town,&#xD;
and the road to it a desperately bad one after&#xD;
a rain. Everybody who entertained any in-&#xD;
terest on the subject-all the friends and ac-&#xD;
quaintances of the Blounts, that is to say-&#xD;
looked anxiously in the morning paper to see&#xD;
if there was a notice, but none appeared;&#xD;
and it was generally understood during the&#xD;
course of the morning that the funeral was&#xD;
appointed for the following day. About noon,&#xD;
however, there was a burial-paper carried&#xD;
round: the funeral would take place at three&#xD;
o'clock r M. It soon transpired, further,&#xD;
that Mr. Blount had with difficulty been in-&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
duced to consent to this change of arrange.&#xD;
ment, on the representations of the physicians&#xD;
attending his wife, that, unless the body of&#xD;
her daughter was removed from the house&#xD;
very soon, they could not answer for her&#xD;
sanity, so violent was her grief and her re-&#xD;
morse.&#xD;
"No wonder Mrs. Blount feels remorse!"&#xD;
said Laura Ashby, as her brother sat down&#xD;
beside her in bhe ~arriage, to go to the fu-&#xD;
neral. "She is just as much Emily's mur-&#xD;
derer as if she had taken a knife and cut her&#xD;
throat!"&#xD;
Then, with all the eloquence of grief and&#xD;
indignation, Laura proceeded to relate to her&#xD;
brother (who had returned home only two&#xD;
days previously, after a long absence, and&#xD;
consequently was not informed in the matter&#xD;
of the social gossip of J-) the whole his-&#xD;
tory of the matchc" over which Mrs. Jilount&#xD;
had made so much rejoicing, and which had&#xD;
ended so tragically.&#xD;
"0 Duncan! if you had seen her smile,&#xD;
her face, as she looked up at me just be-&#xD;
fore-"&#xD;
The girl paused-her voice choked in tears.&#xD;
"And she died of disease of the heart, it&#xD;
is thought? "asked Duncan, who was a physi-&#xD;
cian, and naturally felt an interest in the sub-&#xD;
ject of so unusual and sudden a death, but&#xD;
had had no opportunity of speaking to his&#xD;
sister about it before, as she had not been at&#xD;
home from the time of Emily's death until&#xD;
she returned half an hour before, to change&#xD;
her dress for the funeral.&#xD;
"Of course it was disease of the heart,"&#xD;
she answered. "The doctors said so-and&#xD;
what else could it have been? They were&#xD;
trying every thing to recover her yesterday&#xD;
morning; for the doctors thought at first that&#xD;
it might be merely a fainting - lit. But I&#xD;
knew better. I knew the instant I looked at&#xD;
her that she was dead! She was just as c6ld&#xD;
and rigid l~hen-and it had not been ten min-&#xD;
utes since she was speaking to me-just as&#xD;
cold and rigid as she is now. I want you to&#xD;
see her, Duncan; she looks so lovely!"&#xD;
The carriage stopped at this moment. They&#xD;
alighted, and, entering the house, Laura led&#xD;
the way at once into the back drawing-room,&#xD;
where the body of Emily Blount was lying.&#xD;
It was before the days of burial-cases, and&#xD;
the top of the coffin had not yet been put on;&#xD;
the full-length figure was visible, in all the&#xD;
mocking glory of her bridal array.&#xD;
&#xD;
"flow beautiful!" was Duncan Ashby's&#xD;
first thought, as his eye rested on it; and&#xD;
then, with a sudden, sharp pain that sur-&#xD;
prised himself, he remembered a single line&#xD;
of poetry he had lately seen quoted in some&#xD;
novel he had been reading:&#xD;
"Death holds not long his fairest guest un-&#xD;
changed."&#xD;
The young man had been studying disease&#xD;
and death in all their numberless forms, in the&#xD;
hospitals of Paris, until, like too many of his&#xD;
profession, he had come to practically regard&#xD;
the human body simply as a curious piece of&#xD;
mechanism animated by the vital principle.&#xD;
But he could not look at the form before&#xD;
him in this cold, abstract manner. He could&#xD;
only gaze on it as a vision of beauty such as&#xD;
he had never beheld before. There was not&#xD;
the faintest shade of death's livid hue on the&#xD;
pure whiteness of the face; no sinking or&#xD;
sharpness of feature; there was, even, none&#xD;
of that peculiar expression around the lips,&#xD;
and in the fall of the eyelashes upon the&#xD;
cheek, which is the most invariable signet set&#xD;
by Death upon his victims. And yet it did&#xD;
not look like life, either. In both form and&#xD;
face there was a rigidness resembling mar-&#xD;
ble more than flesh; and the complc~ion was&#xD;
unnaturally tintless; bloodlessly transparent&#xD;
as Parian. It seemed a thing that belonged&#xD;
neither to death nor to life-but, rather, to the&#xD;
realm of the beautiful in art; like&#xD;
"Sonic bright creation of the Grecian chisel:&#xD;
As cold, as pale, as passionless, as perfect."&#xD;
How long Duncan Ashby remained in&#xD;
rapt contemplation of that lovely mould of&#xD;
clay, he could not have told. Indeed, he&#xD;
afterward had a very indistinct recollection&#xD;
of every thing that occurred during the fol-&#xD;
lowing two hours. That double conscious-&#xD;
ness which ofteti enables us to acquit our-&#xD;
selves creditably in word and manner, while&#xD;
our thoughts are far away from time and&#xD;
place, must have befriended him; ~'or, not-&#xD;
withstanding that a very grave conflict was&#xD;
going on in his mind, no outward token be~&#xD;
traded it.&#xD;
Though the hour was barely that of sun-&#xD;
set when the long line of carriages that had&#xD;
followed Emily Blount's funeral left the ceme-&#xD;
tery gate to return to town,, the sky was so&#xD;
overcast that dusk had already fallen; and&#xD;
when Duncan Ashby and his sister arrived at&#xD;
home, it was quite dark. Dinner had been&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC8067-00000085"/>&#xD;
164                        A DOUBT.                                                                     A DOUBT.                        165&#xD;
&#xD;
kept waiting for them, and to Duncan's satis-&#xD;
faction was served immediately. Laura, ex-&#xD;
cusing herself on the plea of a bad headache,&#xD;
retired at once to her own room; and Mr.&#xD;
Ashby, pare, though he had already dined,&#xD;
complacently sat down to keep his son com-&#xD;
pany. He was rather shocked by the hasty&#xD;
manner in which Duncan dispatched the busi-&#xD;
ness. He ate-for he was hungry and need-&#xD;
ed his dinner-but he ate like a hungry man&#xD;
who was in a gweat hurry; and on rising from&#xD;
table surprised.Mr. Ashby by leaving him for&#xD;
the evening. He had an engagement, he&#xD;
said, which would probably detain him out&#xD;
late; and so he would wish his father good.&#xD;
night before going.&#xD;
A thin, drizzling rain had set in half an&#xD;
hour before, and had been increasing steadily&#xD;
in violence ever since; and consequently it&#xD;
was through a pelting shower that 'Duncan&#xD;
made his way to the house of Dr. Boyd,&#xD;
Mr. Blount's family physician. It chanced&#xD;
that the doctor, who was a widower, and kept&#xD;
whatever hours suited his convenience of the&#xD;
moment, having dined before going to the&#xD;
funeral, was just enjoying a substantial sup.&#xD;
per, in all the ease and comfort of dressing-&#xD;
gown and slippers. Duncan's ring at the&#xD;
door startled him to the indulgence in one or&#xD;
two expletives rather more emphatic than&#xD;
reverent, for he apprehended that it might&#xD;
be a professional call; and he felt irritated at&#xD;
the bare thought of having to leave his com-&#xD;
fortable fireside-to say nothing of the whis-&#xD;
key-punch which was at that moment in pro-&#xD;
cess of brewing by his trusty housekeeper-&#xD;
and brave the inclement weather without.&#xD;
But, on learning that it was a visitor instead&#xD;
of a call, he ordered the servant to show the&#xD;
young man in, and rose with the greatest cor-&#xD;
diality to welcome him.&#xD;
The first salutations over, Duncan, after&#xD;
declining supper, as he had just risen from&#xD;
dinner, proceeded at once to the business&#xD;
which had brought him through the rain and&#xD;
the night.&#xD;
"Doctor," he said, with a smile, "do you&#xD;
know a sane man when you see him?"&#xD;
The doctor's eyes opened wide in astonish.&#xD;
ment. "What do you mean?" he inquired.&#xD;
"Just put your finger on my pulse, will&#xD;
you," said Duncan, extending his wrist-&#xD;
*" and look me straight in the eyes. Well, are&#xD;
they the pulse and the eye of health, bodily&#xD;
and mental?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"What do you mean?" asked the doctor&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"I have come to you on an errand wlich&#xD;
I am afraid you will consider so insane that,&#xD;
before telling you what it is, I think it well&#xD;
to take the precautionary measure of con-&#xD;
vincing you that I am compos menus."&#xD;
"We'll say that I am convinced, then. Go&#xD;
on," said the doctor, whose curiosity was&#xD;
considerably excited.&#xD;
"In a word, I doubt if the young lady&#xD;
who was buried this afternoon, is dead; and&#xD;
I have come to ask you to go with me, with-&#xD;
out loss of time, and examine whether my&#xD;
suspicion is correct."&#xD;
"What 1" cried the doctor, as soon as he&#xD;
recovered himself sufficiently to speak, his&#xD;
breath having been quite taken away by&#xD;
Duncan's astounding assertion and proposal.&#xD;
"What!"&#xD;
Duncan repeated, a little more at length,&#xD;
what he had said before.&#xD;
"Good Heavens!" exclaimed the doctor,&#xD;
"what has put such an idea into your&#xD;
head?"&#xD;
"It is not an idea, but a doubt, that I en-&#xD;
tertain- a faint doubt, I will say- but, a&#xD;
doubt. And it seems to me an imperative&#xD;
duty to clear it up in time."&#xD;
"Unquestionably," answered the doc-&#xD;
tor. "What are your grounds for this&#xD;
doubt?"&#xD;
Duncan proceeded to explain, in technical&#xD;
phrase, certain slight appearances and indi-&#xD;
cations which he had observed, without at&#xD;
the time attaching much importance to them&#xD;
-but which gradually acquired more and&#xD;
more weight in his estimation, until he final-&#xD;
ly resolved, while returning from the funeral,&#xD;
to lay them before Dr. Boyd, and entreat his&#xD;
assistance in the investigation which he him-&#xD;
self was resolved to make.&#xD;
"But why the d-l," said the doctor, im-&#xD;
patiently, "didn't you speak at once? You&#xD;
thought the girl was alive, and yet said not a&#xD;
word against her being buried! I'll be d-d&#xD;
if that looks as if you were compos men-&#xD;
tis I"&#xD;
"Well, in the first place, as I told you,&#xD;
these symptoms, or indications, did not strike&#xD;
me very forcibly at the time that I observed&#xD;
them. Yost must be aware, doctor, that there&#xD;
is such a thing as dormant perceptions. I am&#xD;
afraid that I must acknowledge that, so long&#xD;
as I was looking at the body itself; I was eon-&#xD;
&#xD;
scious of nothing but its wonderful beauty.&#xD;
It was afterward, a's I was looking at the pie.&#xD;
ture it left on my memory, that the doubt&#xD;
came like a flash to my mind, 'Is not this a&#xD;
cataleptic trance?'"&#xD;
Dr. Boyd looked thoughtful; and then&#xD;
he asked various questions, all of which Dun-&#xD;
can answered readily.&#xD;
"I wish to Heaven," he said, finally, "that&#xD;
you had spoken in time to save all this trou-&#xD;
ble, or else that your 'dormant perceptions'&#xD;
had remained dormant until to-morrow morn-&#xD;
ing! A pretty task this is that you've set&#xD;
yourself and me, to go diving into a vault on&#xD;
a business of this sort, at night-and such a&#xD;
night! Well, how do you propose to proceed&#xD;
in the affair?" he concluded, resignedly.&#xD;
"I leave that for you to decide," an-&#xD;
swered Duncan. "If you agree with me in&#xD;
thinking thgtt, slight as my doubt is, it justi-&#xD;
fies, nay, demands an. investigation, you can&#xD;
best decide what is to be done."&#xD;
The doctor wrinkled his forehead, and&#xD;
spent some minutes in profound cogitation.&#xD;
Then he rose and rang the bell once-and,&#xD;
after an interval of a few seconds, rang it&#xD;
again, twice.&#xD;
"Bring round the baronche, Tony," he&#xD;
said to the man-servant who first appeared&#xD;
-and who, with a not well-pleased "Yes, sir,"&#xD;
disappeared as a woman - servant entered.&#xD;
"Clarinda," said the doctor - "ah, you've&#xD;
brought the punch-just in good time.-Take&#xD;
a glass, Duncan !-Clarinda, I am going out,&#xD;
and may bring back with me, in half an hour or&#xD;
a little longer, a-a sick person. Have a room&#xD;
ready-with a good fire and a warm bed, and&#xD;
have plenty of hot water and hot bricks on&#xD;
~ hand, so as to be ready for any emergency.&#xD;
And, hark you! don't be scared at any thing&#xD;
you may see when I return. Bring my boots,&#xD;
coat, and overcoat."&#xD;
With a heart-felt sigh, he put off his dress.&#xD;
ing-gown and slippers, indeed the out-door&#xD;
costume, and, after paying his respects to the&#xD;
punch, he and Duncan sallied forth. They&#xD;
found the barouche and Tony waiting. The&#xD;
latter, to his great joy, having been informed&#xD;
that his attendance was not required, they&#xD;
entered the carriage and drove off at a pace&#xD;
which soon brought them to the door of the&#xD;
small house near the cemetery, which was oc-&#xD;
cupied by the sexton who had charge of the&#xD;
place. By a considerable expenditure of&#xD;
time, patience, and argument, this personage&#xD;
&#xD;
was convinced that their errand to Mr.&#xD;
Bloiint's family vault was not of an illegiti-&#xD;
mate and nefarious nature. It took all the&#xD;
weight of Dr. Boyd's character to reassure&#xD;
the natural distrust with which the sexton&#xD;
regarded the medical profession in connection&#xD;
with burial-grounds. Finally, hos~ever, his&#xD;
scruples were satisfied-more particularly as&#xD;
he was invited to inspect their proceedings&#xD;
with his own eyes-and, taking his dark lan-&#xD;
tern in one hand, and his keys in the other,&#xD;
he preceded the two gentlemen along the wind-&#xD;
ing gravel-walk which led to their point of&#xD;
destination. In a few minutes they found&#xD;
themselves within the va~,lt.&#xD;
It was a dank, dismal place, ill venti-&#xD;
lated, and consequently very damp; paved&#xD;
and walled with brick, and surrounded on&#xD;
three sides by a shelf of about two feet in&#xD;
width, on which was deposited half a score&#xD;
or so of coffins, some of which had mouldered&#xD;
almost to dust, while others were perfectly&#xD;
sound apparently, though all but the one&#xD;
which had been so recently deposited were&#xD;
mouldy and mildewed. Having lighted the&#xD;
candles which they had brought, and so dis-&#xD;
posed them as to throw a good light over&#xD;
their further proceedings, they, with the as-&#xD;
sistance of the sexton, lifted the coffin which&#xD;
they came to inspect from the shelf to the&#xD;
floor. The lid was unscrewed, and, after ex-&#xD;
changing one glance, they lifted it from the&#xD;
shell.&#xD;
There was no change in the appearance&#xD;
of the body. Dr. Boyd touched the brow,&#xD;
the hands; drew forth a pocket-mirrorand,&#xD;
holding it before the nostrils, examined care-&#xD;
fully to see whether the glass was dimmed.&#xD;
Then he shook his head.&#xD;
"We have our labor for our pains," he&#xD;
said, in a low tone. "Still I am glad we&#xD;
came. After you had once put that ugly&#xD;
thought of burying alive into my head, I&#xD;
could not have rested until I convinced my-&#xD;
self, by ocular demonstration, that there was&#xD;
no danger of such a thing. I suppdse you&#xD;
are satisfied now? I am, and I think we&#xD;
had better close the coffin and go."&#xD;
"Stop a moment," said Duncas~, A~ I will&#xD;
be satisfied, doctor, with two more te~sts.&#xD;
Try the first yourself; put your hand under&#xD;
the armpits, and see if (here is the same&#xD;
chill there as here." He pointed to the&#xD;
brow.&#xD;
Dr. Boyd did as requested. With some&#xD;

A DOUBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
difficulty he insinuated his fingers between&#xD;
the arm and the chest, on the outside of the&#xD;
clothing. His face changed a little. He&#xD;
thought or he imagined that there was not&#xD;
that penetrating chill of death here. To de-&#xD;
cide the point, he opened his penknife, and,&#xD;
with a hand that trembled slightly, he in-&#xD;
serted the blade in the edge of the dress at&#xD;
the throat, and cut through the lace, silk,&#xD;
and linen, that enveloped the bust. He&#xD;
placed his hand first over the heart, waited&#xD;
patiently, examined closely, and again shook&#xD;
his head.&#xD;
"The armpits!" said Duncan.&#xD;
The doctor pushed his hand slowly along,&#xD;
finally paused and started; then, with almost&#xD;
a bound, he exclaimed, "By Heaven, you are&#xD;
right! there is warmth-she is not dead!"&#xD;
"Now, see here," said Duncan. He lifted&#xD;
&#xD;
her right hand, straightening the elbow, and&#xD;
putting the fingers into the position of point.&#xD;
ing at the other side of the vault; after which&#xD;
~he withdrew his hold of it, and it remained&#xD;
precisely as he had placed it.&#xD;
"Catalepsy!" said Dr. Boyd. "God bless&#xD;
you-you have saved her!"&#xD;
Yes, she was saved, but not without much&#xD;
suffering. For months she labored under the&#xD;
disease by which she had been so suddenly&#xD;
attacked, and which had so nearly caused to&#xD;
her the horrible fate from which Duncan&#xD;
Ashby's "doubt" rescued her. Skill and&#xD;
time conquered it eventually, however; and,&#xD;
when health again bloomed in her cheek, a&#xD;
second wedding-day dawned~ for her; And&#xD;
this time Mr. Madison was not the bride-&#xD;
groom.&#xD;
