CHAPTER I.&#xD;
WHERE BORN-WHEN DOUBTFUL-THE BEACH&#xD;
OF ~ ISLAND-MY NURSE AND HER&#xD;
MARVELS-SINBAD AND GULLiVER-THE CITY&#xD;
GUARDS IN CHARLESTON, S. 0.-MY DREAM-&#xD;
REFLECTIONS ON COMMENCING MY AUTOBIO-&#xD;
GRAPHY.&#xD;
Our family Bible has been lost, and there has&#xD;
been a dispute about my age. Phrenologically, I&#xD;
have no memory for dates and the chronological&#xD;
sequence of events; and if I had, I could not settle&#xD;
this point. At auiy rate, I was born many yeais&#xD;
within this century, in the city of Charleston,&#xD;
South Carolina. But my childhood has not many&#xD;
memories of my earliest home, though I am proud&#xD;
of it, and say of it as the poet said of his:&#xD;
fS With all thy faults, I love thee still."&#xD;
What I most remember is the beach of Sullivan's&#xD;
island, where we used to spend the summer for&#xD;
the sake of health. With a fascinated fear I loved&#xD;
to stand, when a very child, on the extremity of&#xD;
the beach, and behold the illimitable waves gamboll-&#xD;
ing before me like so many living beii~gs of the&#xD;
deep at play. I delighted to pick the shells strew-&#xD;
ed around, and marvel over their construction and&#xD;
beauty. And many a time have I set1 the mimic&#xD;
boat of my childish workmanship afioi~t upon the&#xD;
waters while I watched the wave, thinking it was&#xD;
&#xD;
coming at me as I advanced to its edge to launch&#xD;
my chip-built vessel. I can remember, too, the in-&#xD;
tense wish I had to send my vision far beneath&#xD;
the waves and discover the secrets of the deep&#xD;
below.&#xD;
What must have impressed this more upon me&#xD;
was the fact that I had often heard the nurse who&#xD;
attended me--a mulatto slave who had been taught&#xD;
to read-tell of the adventures of Sinbad the s~tilor&#xD;
and the equally miraculous ones of the reno~4 ned&#xD;
Gulliver. I do believe that the wish to get by&#xD;
myself and know all about these wonderful trav-&#xD;
ellers created my first desire to learn to read; for&#xD;
though my nurse often read the exploits of these&#xD;
worthies aloud to me, yet I was puzzled with parts&#xD;
of their narratives more than I thought I should&#xD;
have been if I could have read it myself. This&#xD;
was owning, no doubt, not only to my inability to&#xD;
comprehendd the meaning of many of the words, but&#xD;
also to the nurse's manner of pronouncing them,&#xD;
for they often puzzled her. In fact, when she&#xD;
came to a word that was at all a poser, she gener-&#xD;

text itself. How I hive woi3d~ered over the confir-&#xD;
sion it created in my brain; graver commentators&#xD;
since, on more veracious books hawe reconciled me&#xD;
to such bewilderments.&#xD;
Whenever the nurse took me out walking in&#xD;
the city, I insisted upon going down by the wharf,&#xD;
for I loved to gaze at the shippirtgand wonder over&#xD;
the sailors-$inbad and Gulliver being all the&#xD;
while in my imagination. The old French ne-&#xD;
gresses who sold cakes at the corners,, often at-&#xD;
tracted my attention and my pennies-the last by&#xD;
the tempting display of their tables,' and the first&#xD;
by their confused babel of French, English and&#xD;
African phraseology combined. I used to marvel&#xD;
why I could not understand these cake sellers, who1&#xD;
my nurse, to heighten herself in my eye, had told&#xD;
me could not read, and who were nothing but old&#xD;
women, when I could comprehend such wonderful&#xD;
men as Sinbad and Gulliver, and had painted in&#xD;
my mind's eye an exact piebure of overy thing they&#xD;
had seen and encountered.&#xD;
In Charleston, in those days, for I have never&#xD;
been there since, the guardians of the city-who in&#xD;
the eastern cities are called the watch, and who~&#xD;
pass along through the streets in their daily citi-&#xD;
zen's dress unarmed, except with a spike-headed&#xD;
weapon-were denominated guards, and appeared&#xD;
in uniform, with muskets and music. At a certain&#xD;
hour each night they paraded from one guard hopse&#xD;
to the other, and well do I remember the first&#xD;
night I saw rhem pass, by the dim lights of the&#xD;
lamps. It was the first time that I had been awake&#xD;
till nine, (the hour they paraded) and thiC had&#xD;
happened in consequence of the indulgence of my&#xD;
nurse, who allowed me to sit up, as my parents&#xD;
were at a party and would not be home till after&#xD;
midnight.&#xD;
I had seen the volunteer companies through the&#xD;
day, when they were "playing soldiers," and I&#xD;
had heard them fire their guns, which I was in-&#xD;
formed had no ballets in them, as it was only&#xD;
"make believe," but these guards my nurse told&#xD;
me had bullets in their guns. and that they took&#xD;
evil doers, even boys when they were bad, and&#xD;
thrust them in a huge, dark cellar, which had iron&#xD;
bark across the windows. That huge, dark cellar&#xD;
and those iron bars kept me awake half the night.&#xD;
And when I fell asleep I thought myself a bad&#xD;
&#xD;
[OGRAPHY OF&#xD;
boys locked up in their durance, and guarded by a&#xD;
ferocioas soldier, who kept. continually pointing&#xD;
his gun at me. This was but a dream, a child's&#xD;
dream, yet its horrors live in my memory strong-&#xD;
er than m'an~ a stern reality. Frequently since&#xD;
have I looked back through the struggles of man-&#xD;
hood to that dream of my boyhood, and felt the con-&#xD;
viction that many a hard encounter with flesh and&#xD;
blood and stormy passions, had not half the fears of&#xD;
that night's fancies. ' "Is not the past all sha-&#xD;
dow?" asks the poet, and if it is not, the shadow,&#xD;
even when it gathers qver our manhood, is some-&#xD;
times more painful than the reality.&#xD;
I feel a strange waywardness' as I lift the pen te&#xD;
narrate my adventures. Shall I fully draw back&#xD;
the curtaia?-shalj 1 tell all'?-or shall I play and&#xD;
palter with the truth, heighten my good deeds with&#xD;
the meretricious adornments of the imagination, and&#xD;
lessen my evil ones by borrowing the same light,&#xD;
and when I tell them, interweaving apologising&#xD;
constructions with their guilt. Reader, you must&#xD;
bear with me. If a ~vild and way ward course has&#xD;
been mine, you must bear with me. Perhaps the&#xD;
best man, if he exposed thoroughly to human in-&#xD;
spection all his motives as well as actions, would&#xD;
startle you as much with the exposure of 'tempts&#xD;
tion; that he sometimes did not soon enough re-&#xD;
sist, as he would impress you with the admiration&#xD;
of his good deeds.&#xD;
When I contemplated these hurried sketches&#xD;
and threw my memory back to the past, a 'thousand&#xD;
dim and shadowy images presented themselves.&#xD;
Here and there a passion or event arose distinctly,&#xD;
but as 1 dwelt upon it, the wonder came that it was&#xD;
not of more importance in my history. Is it not&#xD;
strange that when we make the greatest effort to&#xD;
recall events, that we do not feel them half so viv-&#xD;
idly as at some seemingly mal-a-propos moment,&#xD;
when they flash upon us unbidden, and like the&#xD;
ghost of Banquo will not down.&#xD;

be dear unto me 'as a friend, and with the unre-&#xD;
servedness of friendship, I will make you my con~&#xD;
fidant, thinking that your sympathies will give&#xD;
me aid and countenance in my narration.&#xD;
My grandfather was named Antoine Berthold,&#xD;
and was a descendant of a French refugee, whose&#xD;
ancestors fled from France on the revocation of the&#xD;
edict of Nantz, and settled in South Carolina.. My&#xD;
grandfather brought with him considerable means,&#xD;
with which he purchased a plantation on the little&#xD;
'Pedee, in conducting which he was unsuccessful.&#xD;
With the remnant of means left him, after paying&#xD;
his debts, with the mercurial adaptation of a French&#xD;
man, he rexnoved to Charleston, and became a&#xD;
commission merchant in King street. He soon&#xD;
took the "fever" and died, leaving my father a&#xD;
destituteorphan, for my paternal grandmother had&#xD;
died of the same disease a few months after their&#xD;
emigration.&#xD;
A Carolina gentleman, named John Russell,&#xD;
who was a great friend of my grandfather's, adopt-&#xD;
ed my father, upon the condition that he would&#xD;
take his name, promising, if he did so, to leave him&#xD;
his property, which at that time was ample. My&#xD;
father,' not without some hesitation, complied, for&#xD;
he had a crotchet in his head about family pride.&#xD;
'In due time Mr. Russell set my father up in the&#xD;
hardware business, which was his choice. A short&#xD;
time after this my father married a Miss Huger-&#xD;
son, and I was their first and only son.&#xD;
One day when playing on the beach of Sulli-&#xD;
van's island, through the carelessness of rnj nurse,&#xD;
I fell in and 'like to have ended my adventures, as&#xD;
&#xD;
Miss Betsy Hugerson, who was written to on the&#xD;
subject, and the next packet brought her to Charles-&#xD;
ton to take charge of me on its return to Baltimore.&#xD;
She was a fat, solemn, gossiping old lady, who&#xD;
soon won my affections by gingerbread. sweetmeats&#xD;
and all sorts of kindness. Under her charge I was&#xD;
dispatched to Baltimore, not then the "Monumen-&#xD;
tal City." My father bid me a good bye without&#xD;
much emotion, but my dear mother wept over me&#xD;
again and again, went down with the nurse on&#xD;
board of the packet with us, and held' me on her&#xD;
lap weeping over me, until we got under way,&#xD;
when she blessed me with an overflowing heart&#xD;
and left me to the charge of aunt' Betsy, who had&#xD;
peremptorily refused to let my nurse go with us,&#xD;
saying to my mother, with much intended dignity:&#xD;
"I certainly consider myself old enough, and strong&#xD;
enough, and knowing enough' to take care of a&#xD;
child like William-Billy will ~be a~ good boy, I&#xD;
know." The poor lady little dreamed, of the re-&#xD;
spuasihility she 'was assuming.&#xD;
I was too young 'to observe much of the&#xD;
voyage,' and could not if .1 'had been older, for~I&#xD;
was sea sick all the time,' and confined closely to&#xD;
the cabin by my aunt, who seemed to think that&#xD;
fresh sea air was certain death.&#xD;
The United States wer~ just then on the eve of&#xD;
a war with Great Britain, and the indefinable&#xD;
dread of its horrors, which I caught from the con-&#xD;
versatien of the passengers, I r~rnember yet. Our&#xD;
captain was a great advocate for hostilities, as was&#xD;
also a French gentleman. There was a New&#xD;
Englander on board who took the other side, and&#xD;
remember well that the words federalist and&#xD;
democrat were hurled to and fro like bomb shells&#xD;
between belligerents, and 'they seemed, in a social&#xD;

12                          THE AUTOBI&#xD;
celebrated mob tore down the office of the Federal&#xD;
Republican. A number of 4ie friends of Hanson and&#xD;
Wagner, the editors, defended the premises with&#xD;
great spirit from the popular fury, until the exasper-&#xD;
ation of the mob, occasioned by the death of a citi-&#xD;
zen, who was shot from one of the windows, burst&#xD;
all bounds, when the military were ordered out by&#xD;
the authorities, and the inmates of the office were&#xD;
taken to jail as the only place of security. The&#xD;
story of!the murder of several of them by the mob,&#xD;
who had gathered in the night and broken open the&#xD;
jail, is well known. I recollect seeing the defend-&#xD;
ers of that office taken to jail in a hollow square,&#xD;
surrounded by the volunteer companies, and fol-&#xD;
lowed by their yelling and howling assailants. My&#xD;
aunt held me by the skirts of my jacket to prevent&#xD;
me in my eagerness !from pitching out of4~e win-&#xD;
dow. Many of the prisoners, for such Hanson's&#xD;
friends might be called, had their coats off, with&#xD;
handkerchiefs tied round their heads. A day or&#xD;
two afterwards my aunt took me out into the coun-&#xD;
try to spend some time with a cousin of my mother's&#xD;
named Stetson, who happened to live in the neigh-&#xD;
borhood of one of the ringleaders of the mob named&#xD;
Mumma. The latter was a butcher, and lived in&#xD;
a red frame house near the road. He had a drum&#xD;
and fife playing the rogue's march at his establish-&#xD;
ment every' night for a weel~ or more. A federal&#xD;
gentleman, a friend of Mr. ~tetson, who had fled&#xD;
from the mob, left the city, and as Mr. Stetson was&#xD;
a democrat, came out for safety to his country-&#xD;
house. He welcomed' him warmly, but his lady&#xD;
was frightened into hysterics with the fear that&#xD;
Mumma and his friends would find out who their&#xD;
inmate was and inflict mob law upon them for har-&#xD;
boring him. When the gentleman saw this he was&#xD;
about taking his leave, butMr. Stetson peremptorily&#xD;
insisted upon his remaining, and he did so.&#xD;
That night Mumma came up to the house, but it&#xD;
was merely to know if Mr. Stetson, whom he sup-&#xD;
plied with meat, wanted any in the morning. 'He&#xD;
was a large, big-headed fellow, brim full of mob-&#xD;
ocracy, the rights of man, and proscription of the&#xD;
Federalists. Mr. Stetson was himself a great dem-,&#xD;
~    ocrat, and hated Hanson, but he respected the laws,&#xD;
andtold Mamma to his face that he expected to see&#xD;
the slayers of General Lingan tried, found&#xD;
~uUty, and executed for murder. Mumma mut-&#xD;
&#xD;
[OGRAPHY 01?&#xD;
tered surlily something or other to himself and&#xD;
walked off.&#xD;
Mrs. Stetson, who with my aunt had been a&#xD;
fearful listener at the window, called out to Mam-&#xD;
ma not to forget the meat in the morning. He re-&#xD;
plied in a pleased tone: "I'd do anything for you,&#xD;
Madam," and walked away more cheerfully.&#xD;
I knew this man in after years. I do not know&#xD;
whether it was ever proved conclusively that he&#xD;
was one of the slayers in the jail, but this I know,&#xD;
that if ever the mob was alluded to in his presence,&#xD;
he was always sure to scowl and walk away.&#xD;
Doubtless the old inhabitants of Baltimore, some&#xD;
of whom might say perchance-&#xD;
"All which I saw and part of which I was."&#xD;
remember the causes of this mob; while I, a little&#xD;
child, only caught a passing glimpse of some of its&#xD;
slight incidents. The violent course of the Fed-&#xD;
eral Republican in relation to the war, was the ex-&#xD;
citing cause of the mob. For vindictive assaults&#xD;
upon President Madison and other prominent states-&#xD;
men of that day, it surpassed every thing of the&#xD;
kind from that day to this. It excited the people&#xD;
to madness. On the Declaration of War against&#xD;
Great Britain, the Republican came out in hot&#xD;
haste against it, and its leader was headed: "Thou&#xD;
hast done a deed whereas valor will weep.~~&#xD;
At the time of the war I was dwelling in the city&#xD;
with aunt Betsy, and when the bombardment of&#xD;
Fort Mdllenry "came ~ to use a phrase of the&#xD;
turf, Mr. Stetson invited us out to his farm, that&#xD;
we might be out of ~ way should. the foe suc-&#xD;
ceed in taking Baltimore. His country seat was&#xD;
some miles from the city, on the York road, and yet&#xD;
we could distinctly hear the "bombs bursting in&#xD;
air," the night of the attack. Miss Hugerson used&#xD;
to lead me down to the road side to see the volun-&#xD;
teers from the interior as they flocked in to the de-&#xD;
fence of the city; and it was glorious to hear their&#xD;
animated greetings as they passed. 0! how I&#xD;
longed to be a man and a soldier.&#xD;
After the British retreated from North Point, a&#xD;
party was made up to visit the battle ground, and&#xD;
my aunt, fearful that some accident might happen&#xD;
to me if she left me behind, took me with her. I&#xD;
remember nothing of the locality, except the meet-&#xD;
ing house; the trees and fence were filled with bul.~&#xD;
&#xD;

WILLIAM&#xD;
&#xD;
lets, and I shuddered beside the fresh and rudely&#xD;
made graves of the slain.&#xD;
The illumination for the victory of New Orleans&#xD;
and peace vividly impressed me. The streets&#xD;
were as light as day. 'A thot~and devices of a per-&#xD;
sonal as well as patriotic character blazed in the&#xD;
transparencies that were affixed to many of the pri-&#xD;
vate as well as public edifices. The streets were&#xD;
thronged with a rejoicing crowd, composed of the&#xD;
fashionable as well a~ the vulgar, who greeted each&#xD;
other gaily as they passed, for all seemed proud of&#xD;
their . country and her people. It seemed like a&#xD;
scene in the Arabian Nights entertainment. The&#xD;
earth lost its earthiness, and after I was put to bed&#xD;
I wondered and wondered over it until I was&#xD;
transported into the )and of dreams, the glitter-&#xD;
ing scenes of which, though full of Qriental niag-&#xD;
nificence, have never 'impressed me more than&#xD;
that illumination.&#xD;

-1 CAPiTULATE FRQM UNDER THE BED.&#xD;
How strong is the love of woman! My aunt&#xD;
was upwards of fifty when she undertook the voy-&#xD;
age from Baltimore to Charleston for my sake; or&#xD;
rather it was for my mother's sake, to whom she&#xD;
was ardently attached. Me she had never seen,&#xD;
but she loved me extempore for my maternity.&#xD;
Instead of assuming any control over me, the&#xD;
good old lady generally gave me my own way in&#xD;
every thing, until some outrageous prank on my&#xD;
part, drove her beyond all forbearance, and then&#xD;
she belabored me with great zeal, puffing and&#xD;
wheezing the while, and sometimes weeping with&#xD;
very vexation.&#xD;
We lived in Calvert street at the time to which&#xD;
I allude, and my aunt had an ancient gossip named&#xD;
Clayton, who dwelt iii an old fashioned frame build-&#xD;
ing situated where the Athtmieum now stands.&#xD;
Mrs. Clayton was poor, and my aunt never made&#xD;
&#xD;
RUSSELL.                                13&#xD;
her a visit without taking her a present of some&#xD;
kind of other. Now my mother had given the&#xD;
old lady a quantity of imperial tea, which, chanced,&#xD;
a rare chance, to suit the old lady's palate exactly,&#xD;
and she had brought it all the way from Charleston&#xD;
with an especial eye to Mrs. Clayton and the talks&#xD;
she anticipated over it.&#xD;
One winter's evening, my aunt was seated by the&#xD;
fire snugly cogitating to herself, when all at once&#xD;
it occurred to her that she would take some of the&#xD;
tea on the morrow afternoon to her friend. Ac-&#xD;
cordingly she ordered the servant to hand her a&#xD;
large tea canister which contained it, and she fixed&#xD;
~a newspaper on her lap ready to make up a pack-&#xD;
age of it.&#xD;
It was much the custom of the boys in my day,&#xD;
as I presume it is still, to play what they call hook&#xD;
pins, which was as follows: each put a pin itt the&#xD;
end of his jacket and bent it like a fish hook, he&#xD;
then hooked with his neighbor, and. the one who&#xD;
pulled the other's pin out had it. Of course large&#xD;
pins were in demand. My aunt had a quantity of&#xD;
them, that she "set great store by," to use her&#xD;
own expression, because they served her better&#xD;
than the smaller ones in fixing a cloth round a&#xD;
huge brick, which she warmed every night and&#xD;
took to bed with her to keep her feet warm. Be-&#xD;
sides, she would not let me have a single solitary&#xD;
pin, because it was a bad play, for the boys tore&#xD;
their jackets by it and wasted pins.&#xD;
At first I slyly took the pins from the drawer&#xD;
without saying by your leave, till she detected me&#xD;
and kept the drawer locked. My stock of large&#xD;
pins being exhausted, I had to practice a bit of&#xD;
diplomacy - I asserted that my feet were cold too,&#xD;
and insisted upon it that I must have a brick; ac-&#xD;
cordingly, one was got ready for rue, and the large&#xD;
pins were forthcoming. I occupied a small room&#xD;
next to aunt Betsy's. The second night of my&#xD;
feet warming, instead of sending the servant up&#xD;
ftr the light when I had gotten in bed, she came&#xD;
up herself to see that all was safe and tuck me in,&#xD;
and caught me with the denuded brick in the&#xD;
hearth and myself in the act of fixing a pin in my&#xD;
jacket. My hypocrisy was thus discovered, and I&#xD;
had a brick no more.&#xD;
The boys at school had all envied me my big~&#xD;
pins. 1 was now pushed to my wit's ends t~ ob&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8021-00000006"/>&#xD;
14&#xD;
&#xD;
lain them, for I had driven with them many pro-&#xD;
4&#xD;
Iltable bargains in the apple and cake line.&#xD;
The old lady, on the evening above mentioned,&#xD;
had the cloth in which she wrapped her brick&#xD;
under her on the seat of her chair, and sticking in&#xD;
it were some half dozen of'these victorious pins.&#xD;
How to obtain one or two was the question. I had&#xD;
been looking out for an opportunityin vain. Strat-&#xD;
agem was my only resource. Had she gone to&#xD;
* the side board for the tea herself, I might have&#xD;
effected my purpose. Just at this moment Mrs.&#xD;
Boher, a Jewish lady who 'kept a boarding house&#xD;
in our neighborhood, came in with several acquain-&#xD;
tances. Now, thought 1, is my chance, the old'&#xD;
lady will ~arise to receive them and I can fitch a&#xD;
&#xD;
pretence or other, and disturbed me, proclaiming&#xD;
that if she did so again I would throw the contents&#xD;
of the tumbler over her. This was by way of&#xD;
getting out of the scrape. One night I lay awake&#xD;
for the coming of the old lady. She entered her&#xD;
room where she left her candle to discover, by en-&#xD;
tering mine in darkness, if there were sparks left&#xD;
from the candle, whereby I had gone to bed three&#xD;
hours before, and tuck mein. Through my opened&#xD;
door the light from her room shone, so that I saw&#xD;
her plain enough; and I am ashamed now, to say&#xD;
that taking deliberate aim, I threw the tumbler of&#xD;
water full upon her. She left my room after a&#xD;
sudden interjection without saying a word, and I&#xD;
thought she had retreated to bed, believing that I&#xD;
&#xD;
pin. But she apologised for not rising, upon the took her 'for the servant. I instantly covered my&#xD;
score of spilling the tea, but in fact to hide her head with the bed clothes to smother the sounds of&#xD;
&#xD;
brick, cover, while she poked it under her and call-&#xD;
ed the ladies round her' to examine the tea, in&#xD;
praise of which she grew most, eloquent. Foiled&#xD;
in this, I watched 'the Qpportunity while she was&#xD;
folding the parcel, to slip from her lap the twine,&#xD;
with which she was about tyingit. As she faced&#xD;
'the ladies and they faced her, she could rise up&#xD;
and look for the twine at her feet without exposing&#xD;
to sight her burnt brick cover. She did so, When&#xD;
I sent my fingers upon 'a forlorn hope, and snamchd&#xD;
desperately at a shining pin head. I was too&#xD;
hasty, for I jerked out before the whole company&#xD;
the abominable burnt rags, which seemed glad to&#xD;
get loose, for they flew all about the room. Drop-&#xD;
ing her tea in 'a passionate. haste for vengeance,&#xD;
Aunt Betsy flew at we and boxed me soundly.&#xD;
I retreated under the 'table, but she made at ma&#xD;
with the hearth brush, poked me out upon ull&#xD;
fours, in which condition I hastily decamped from&#xD;
the parlor, but not without receiving several blows,&#xD;
without any power of playing th6 Parthian.&#xD;
All this before company galled me 'exceedingly,,&#xD;
and I determined to be avenged.&#xD;
My aunt was in the habit of coming into my&#xD;
room at night before retiring to her own, to see&#xD;
that all was safe, and tuck me, as I have said,&#xD;
which the servant always did two hours before. I&#xD;
complained of being thirsty during the evening,&#xD;
and had a tumbler of water placed by my bed&#xD;
head. ' I moreover alleged that the servant came&#xD;
into my room after' she put me to bed ander some&#xD;
&#xD;
the laughter. which I could not suppress. All at&#xD;
once the cover was jerked off of me and my laugh-&#xD;
ter broke forth. My tune, however, was suddenly&#xD;
changed, for the old lady fell foul of me in my cx&#xD;
posed state, with an immense corset bone, from the&#xD;
whacking application~ of which I had to take re-'&#xD;
fuge under the bed. .1 'had no idea of leaving this&#xD;
security as I did the table, but remained and begged&#xD;
lustily for quarter, until she consented, upon my&#xD;
often repeated parole of honor, that I should come&#xD;
forth' without a renewal of hostilities and retire&#xD;
peaceably to bed.&#xD;

BOOTH-HiS AFFRAY WITH LUSBY.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
The discipline of schools has changed wonder-&#xD;
fully even in my short 'memory. In my boyhood&#xD;
it was the fashion to use the rod, and no teacher&#xD;
that I knew of was unfashionable. I was firs: sent&#xD;
by my aunt to an old woman round the 'cprner,&#xD;
named Grace, who taught a select number of en-&#xD;
breeched boys and as many little girls; meaning&#xD;
thereby as many as she could get. ' I recollect that&#xD;
&#xD;
before my aunt sent mc to her school, she invited&#xD;
the' school mistress to take tea with her, that&#xD;
she might see in his intellectual dishabille her fu-&#xD;
ture pupil. Mrs; Grace, a tall, spare old lady,&#xD;
with a toothless upper jaw, came accordingly. My&#xD;
aunt and she held a long discourse on the subject&#xD;
of education, the most material point of which to&#xD;
me was the averment on the part of Mrs. Grace&#xD;
that she was opposed to much corporal punishment.&#xD;
In speaking of the branches which she taught,&#xD;
Mrs. Grace, in allusion to the unfortunate loss of&#xD;
her upper teeth, said she did not pretend, in conse-&#xD;
quence, to teaclfvprononcation.&#xD;
While the old ladies were gossiping away in a&#xD;
style which in their opinion would have enlight-&#xD;
ened even my Lord Brougham upon the subject of&#xD;
education, I contrived to secret Mrs. Grace's shawl&#xD;
and spectacles under the sofa. When my future&#xD;
schoolmistress arose to depart their mutual aston-&#xD;
ishment at the d~sappearnuce of shawl and specta-&#xD;
cles would have been edifying to a physiognomist,&#xD;
i~nd instructive to an actress whose line was the&#xD;
personation of old women.&#xD;
"Could a thief have stepped in," asked the trem-&#xD;
ulous Mrs. Grace, terrified at her loss.&#xD;
"Do you believe in ghosts, marm," asked my&#xD;
aunt.&#xD;
Before either could answer the other, my aunt's&#xD;
black servant girl Sally dropped on her knees by&#xD;
the sofa and produced them, saying: "Mistus, I&#xD;
"Saw," said Mrs. Grace.&#xD;
"Any how, Mistus, Master Billy put 'em dar."&#xD;
I darted an angry look at ~aIIy, the black girl,&#xD;
while Mrs. Grace ~olemnly put on her spectacles;&#xD;
threw back her head, and took a minute survey of&#xD;
me.&#xD;
I had not been at Mrs. Grace's more then a week&#xD;
when the old lady put the fool's cap on me, because&#xD;
I would not learn my a b's, and stood me up near&#xD;
the door. 1 could have stood a florrging, hut I&#xD;
could not stand the indignity, young as I was, so I&#xD;
threw the fool's cap at the old lady's head, and&#xD;
flung myself out of the room. I had 'to stand a&#xD;
flogging too, for she sent her black girl' after me,&#xD;
who soon over took me, and in spite of my scratch-&#xD;
ing', kicking and yelling, bore me back to school,&#xD;
where she held me while Mrs. Grace, before the&#xD;
&#xD;
assembled urchins, inflicted summary punishment&#xD;
on me.&#xD;
I went home with my eyes all red; and in an-&#xD;
swer to the inquiry of my respectable relative, I at&#xD;
tribute all my grief to my coronation, and said I&#xD;
did not care for the whipping. The 'old lady was&#xD;
so indignant at my being thought a dunce, when&#xD;
as ~he said she knew better, that she took me&#xD;
away from school, by way, I suppose, of proving&#xD;
her own wisdom, if not to make me wise.&#xD;
At the invitation of Mr. Stetson, on ihe approach&#xD;
of summer, Aunt Betsy rented her house until&#xD;
fall, and took me into the country. After this, for&#xD;
several years we spent the summers in the country&#xD;
and the winters in the city.&#xD;
When I grew large efiough I was sent to a&#xD;
country school about three quarters of a mile off.&#xD;
The pedagogue's name was Lusby. His scholars&#xD;
ranged in years variously from twelve to twenty,&#xD;
and were of both sexes, and he used the rod upon&#xD;
all indiscriminately. The school house was a&#xD;
rough frame building, erected by the subscription of&#xD;
the neighbors. In' a log house beside it dwelt the&#xD;
teacher. He was a fat, sensual bachelor, of most&#xD;
ungovernable temper, when aroused, who avowed,&#xD;
we to the unlucky urchin who~brought his toys or&#xD;
marbles into the school. They were taken from&#xD;
him, and he was whipped as soundly as ever he&#xD;
whipped his top. Those who brought merely ap-&#xD;
ples and cakes in their pockets fared better, though&#xD;
not upon them, for if they escaped a whipping, a&#xD;
returnless transfer of the eatables was forthwith&#xD;
made to the desk of~ the master. Many were the&#xD;
propitiatory offering 0f apples, peaches, pears, &amp;amp;c.,&#xD;
laid on the desk of Mr. Lusby.&#xD;
"Ah! that's a fine apple," said he one morning to&#xD;
Tommy Short, as Tommy took his seat after hav-&#xD;
ing placed a glorious pippin in his sweaty palm,&#xD;
'"Tommy, we won't say our dictionary lesson&#xD;
(Tommy never knew his dictionary lesson) this&#xD;
morning, you may go to your cyphering; Smith.&#xD;

"Please, ~ said~ Smith, who was a simple&#xD;
hearted fellow, and not very bright, "I was&#xD;
going to bring you some, but brother won't&#xD;
let me."&#xD;
"Ah, won't let you, why, my boy," asked Lusby&#xD;

16                        THE ATJTOBI&#xD;
in an insimmting tone, but with an eager eye glanc-&#xD;
ing at his rod. Peter hesitated-.&#xD;
"Tell me, Smith."&#xD;
"He says, sir, you ~ so"-&#xD;
"Spe&amp;amp;kit out, sir"-.-exclaimed Lusby, rising in&#xD;
wrath.&#xD;
"So hogish, sit," said Smith, drawing a long&#xD;
breath.&#xD;
"Hog j~s, hey-.you bring me impertinent mes&#xD;
sages; come here, sir."&#xD;
'rhe trembling urchin obeyed, Lusby arose,&#xD;
took the boy by the collar of his jacket and drew&#xD;
him over the slanting leaf of his desk, then snatch-&#xD;
ing down his rod, he applied it might and main to&#xD;
the victim's back.&#xD;
"Oh! Lord, sir, dear Mr. Lusby, I'll biing you&#xD;
a hat full of them," screamed out Smith, as he&#xD;
writhed beneath the infliction.&#xD;
Whack, whack, whank.&#xD;
"You're bribing me with forbidden fruit, are you,&#xD;
sir. Never bring an apple here, sir.5~ Whack,&#xD;
whack, whack. "There, sir, take your seat now&#xD;
and consider this rod the flaming sword that keeps&#xD;
you from the garden-that forbids you to either&#xD;
touch or taste."&#xD;
Poor Smith hurried to his seat, while the pe'da-&#xD;
gogue cast a tyrannical eye round the school, like&#xD;
a Sultan midst his slaves. Losby called his lodg-&#xD;
ing place, ~his one roomed cabin, his office.&#xD;
~ he exclaimed, "stop Smith, no rubbing&#xD;
your back, sir. Get your dictionary-miss just one&#xD;
word of it my boy, and I'll take you into my office&#xD;
and increase the intimacy between your back and&#xD;
my rod, sir-it shall be skin to skin. Martha&#xD;
Jones, what are you looking at," exclaimed Lusby,&#xD;
turning his eye on one of the girls, so named, in the&#xD;
other end of the school room.&#xD;
Martha was an~orphan child, whose mother had&#xD;
died in the hospital a short time after her birth.&#xD;
A blacksmith's wife, who was living in Baltimore,&#xD;
had employed the mother, who gave her name as&#xD;
Jones, until she found her ~eneiente. Not being&#xD;
able to maintain her in the, cares and expense of&#xD;
maternity, the blacksmith's wife, Mrs. Baltzell,&#xD;
had had her taken to the hospital, and notwith-&#xD;
standing her surmises against the poor girl's char-&#xD;
acter, she could not resist the charitable impulse&#xD;
which led her to visit the mother. Mrs. Baltzell&#xD;
&#xD;
~OGRAPHY OF&#xD;
&#xD;
happened to call at the hospital one day, and was&#xD;
told that .Ml~s. Jones, (they called her so, because&#xD;
she was a mother-"a mother but no wife,") was&#xD;
dying. The good woman hastened to her bed aide.&#xD;
As soon as the dying mother saw Mrs. Baltzell&#xD;
her maternal feelings triumphed over the fears of&#xD;
death, and she implored the good lady to take her&#xD;
child. Mrs. Baltzell took the infant in her arms,&#xD;
but said: "Tell me about yourself and its father."&#xD;
"There, there, I know you'll be a mother to it,&#xD;
I'm not what I seem to be-yes, yes, you shall&#xD;
know all about its father. Holy father in heaven,"&#xD;
she exclaimed, rising up, "sustain me;" but ex-&#xD;
hausted nature yielded, she fell back speechless,&#xD;
and lived for an hour afterwards, though she never&#xD;
spoke more.&#xD;
Mrs. Baltzell took the child, and a short time&#xD;
afterwards her husband removed to Baltimore&#xD;
County, and opened a smith's shop, about a mile&#xD;
from the school house. Martha had reached the&#xD;
age of twelve before it occurred to Mrs. Baltrell to&#xD;
send her to school. When it did, she sent her to&#xD;
an old woman, who taught a few children near by.&#xD;
Within a few months she had been a pupil of Mr.&#xD;
Lusby. He seemed to dislike her especially-I&#xD;
cannot tell why or wherefore-perhaps because she&#xD;
was his opposite, or may be because she was an&#xD;
orphan, and comparatively friendless. There are&#xD;
such natures. Martha was now nearly fourteen,&#xD;
and a very pretty, amiable girl.&#xD;
A youth named William Booth, of about eighteen&#xD;
years of age,' and who lived with his widowed&#xD;
mother near the blacksmith's, had, after refusing to&#xD;
go to school at all, lately, of his own accord, become&#xD;
one of Lusby's pupils. He was mi the habit of&#xD;
attending Martha to school, and carrying for her&#xD;
the little basket which contained her dinner. Booth&#xD;
was rather short in statue, but well made and&#xD;
active. He had small, regular features, and a pro-&#xD;
~fusion of light hair, curling all over his head. He&#xD;
was a skilful pugilist. Martha made no reply to&#xD;
busby's inquiry, but turned trembling to her book.&#xD;
"What were you doing, Martha,~~ he thundered&#xD;
out again.&#xD;
"Nothing, sir," said Martha, in a tone scarcely&#xD;
audible, through fear.&#xD;
"Nothing, sirha, there's a falsehood; you were&#xD;
looking at Smith. I shall take you into my office&#xD;
&#xD;
WILLIAM RUSSELL.&#xD;
&#xD;
some of these days-bring me that rod"-and he&#xD;
threw the berch, which he had been using on Smith,&#xD;
at Martha. My seat was at the end of the boy's&#xD;
bench, near the girls, and Booth's was next to&#xD;
_ mine. I overheard him say to Martha, in a tone&#xD;
which did not reach the ear of Lusby:&#xD;
"Sit still-don't move.'~&#xD;
"Ha! rebellion, hey," asked Lusby, as if glad of&#xD;
an opportunity that furnished him an apology for&#xD;
his favorite exercise. "Come, my lady, we won't&#xD;
settle this matter before the young gentlemen-I'll&#xD;
take the rod and you can take my arm, and we'll&#xD;
step into my office."&#xD;
As he spoke, with a gloating glance of sensual&#xD;
cruelty, he stepped towards Martha. Booth arose&#xD;
quickly, as if for some idle purpose or other, drew&#xD;
back his fist, and almost before bushy saw him, he&#xD;
planted a biow; with such scientific skill, between&#xD;
the peepers of the pedagogue, that he fell over like&#xD;
a log, and in his descent struck his head against a&#xD;
corner of the desk, and rolled corpse-like on the&#xD;
floor. Booth looked at him for a moment, as if&#xD;
waiting for him to arise, but finding that he did&#xD;
not, he handed to Martha her bonnet, took her&#xD;
basket in one hand, and herself by the other, and&#xD;
they left the school house.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
SOOTH ARRESTED-BOUND OVER To KEEP THE&#xD;
PEACE-CALLS AT THE SCHOOL-APOLOGIES-&#xD;
SEEN IN THE EVENING WITH LUSBY AT A CR0-&#xD;
CERY-THEY DRiNK TOGETHER-THEIR CON-&#xD;
VERSAi~ION-THE SCHOOL HOUSE BUKNS DOWN&#xD;
~ REMAiNS FOUND.&#xD;
It was ten or fifteen minutes before busby re-&#xD;
covered himself. The boys alternately gazed at&#xD;
him and at each other, but not one spoke a word, I&#xD;
nor made an effort to assist him. By slow degrees&#xD;
he first rubbed his eyes, then felt his head, and at u&#xD;
last raised himself up on his elbow. He looked e&#xD;
round, and finding that Martha and Booth had left, r&#xD;
he assumed a sitting posture on the floor, as if his&#xD;
energies had not yet recovered from the effects of&#xD;
the injury, though aroused to the impulses of de- '1&#xD;
feat, mortification and shame.               n&#xD;
After a mo~xly meditation in that posture, he&#xD;
3&#xD;
&#xD;
17&#xD;
&#xD;
sullenly resumed his feet, and dismissed the school,&#xD;
telling several of the boys, who were his tools, to.&#xD;
remain.&#xD;
In spite of all the entreaties of Booth's mother,&#xD;
Lusby, with well drilled witnesses, ~Ipplied *for a&#xD;
warrant against her son for the assault and battery,&#xD;
and moreover, had him bound over to keep the&#xD;
peace. Booth was known to be a reckless, uncon-&#xD;
trolable youth) and he lay in jail some two weeks,&#xD;
before, at the earnest solicitation of his mother,&#xD;
any one could be gotten to go his security, when&#xD;
two friends of her deceased husband took the re-&#xD;
sponsibility, upon her mortgaging her little property&#xD;
to them, which did not half cover the amount of&#xD;
bail required.&#xD;
When Booth' was bailed, he called on busby at&#xD;
the school, and expressed great contrition for his&#xD;
act, before the scholars, evidently to the surprise&#xD;
of those boys who were old enough to reflect, for&#xD;
they did not believe that he could feel it. He&#xD;
furthermore asserted that he had exerted his influ-&#xD;
ence with Martha Jones and Mrs. Baltzell, to in-&#xD;
duce the former to return again. Booth and busby&#xD;
held a~conversation upon the subject, and it was&#xD;
evidently Booth's object to have the matter termi-&#xD;
nate with his apology. To this Lusby would not&#xD;
consent, but said, he felt that for the dignity of his&#xD;
vocation, as well as an example, putting his own&#xD;
personal feelings out of the question, the press&#xD;
should make know the circumstances of the case.&#xD;
Booth, at this, broke out into a passion, and said&#xD;
Lh t if it were not for the sake of his securities he&#xD;
would pummel the pedagogue to death. At this,&#xD;
Lusby, in evident fear, cooled off apparently, and&#xD;
hey patched up peace between them, though Lus-&#xD;
~y, we all observed, kept the ~chool in later than&#xD;
isual. Booth still, however, continued the con-&#xD;
Tersation, and when we were dismissed, remained&#xD;
vith him.&#xD;
That night they were seen together at a grocery&#xD;
in the road, ~inking, and the school-master was&#xD;
evidently intoxicated. The bar keeper afterwards&#xD;
reported the following as the conversation between&#xD;
hem.&#xD;
"Well," said Booth to Lusby, after they had&#xD;
sore than once replenished their cups, "you agree&#xD;
ow to forget and forgive."&#xD;
"I must think of that, Master Booth. Person'&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC8021-00000008"/>&#xD;
18                        THE AtFTOBI&#xD;
~lly, as I have said, when you called on me in my&#xD;
academy, I do, but I think that the dignity of my&#xD;
office requires some legal measures. Master Booth,&#xD;
it was an outrageous procedure. Miss Jones de-&#xD;
served punishment; that, by the bye, I suppose you&#xD;
admit."&#xD;
"That, by the bye, I don't admit," replied&#xD;
Booth.&#xD;
"Then, sir, there is an end to our colloquy; for,&#xD;
sir, to say that she did not deserve punishment is&#xD;
as much as to say that I was wrong and you were&#xD;
right."&#xD;
"What's that to do with it. I have told you&#xD;
was sorry-let that end it."&#xD;
"By no means, Master Booth, that begins it&#xD;
again. The vast difference in our years, the dig-&#xD;
nity of my station. my own personal dignity"-&#xD;
"Personal dignity," exclaimed Booth, in whom&#xD;
their potations had drowned the caution in which&#xD;
he had carried himself, "why, man, you're drunk&#xD;
now."&#xD;
"Drunk now," retorted Lusby, 'sir, our cob-&#xD;
quy has ended, and I regret that I ever suffered it&#xD;
to commence."&#xD;
"You be hanged. I tell you what it is, old&#xD;
fellow, I'll make it known, for the sake of your&#xD;
personal dignity, as you call it, that you are corned&#xD;
now, and its my opinion that you come it pretty&#xD;
often."&#xD;
At this hard thirst, Mr. Lusby turned away&#xD;
from Booth, and addressed himself to the barkeeper,&#xD;
as if it was beneath him to recognize the presence&#xD;
of his insulter. After walking two or three times&#xD;
up and down the bar room, Booth faced Lusby and&#xD;
observed:&#xD;
"Would'nt you like to have your will of me?&#xD;
0! Lordy, how you would handle the nw hide,&#xD;
would'rit you? I suppose you think you could&#xD;
make me holler."&#xD;
"I think I could, sir," said Lusby, who could&#xD;
not resist making the remark.&#xD;
"You did'nt 'holler, though, when I floored you,&#xD;
did you."&#xD;
Again Lusby addressed the bar-keeper. Booth&#xD;
again walked about, every now and then eyeing&#xD;
his opponent with a fixed gaze. At last he stepped&#xD;
up to him and said:&#xD;
"You can handle the rod first rate, I admit. You&#xD;
&#xD;
[OGRAPHY OF&#xD;
ought to hire out as overseer for old R-, and&#xD;
then you would have your hands full. But no, I&#xD;
suppose you prefer having a boy or a delicate girl,&#xD;
that's it-a delicate girl-don't you now-say,&#xD;
don't you?"&#xD;
Lusby made no reply, and after another pause,&#xD;
Booth said:&#xD;
"Come, old fellow, say something, or treat."&#xD;
No reply being made, he continued:&#xD;
"Well, I'll stand treat myself. It can't hurt&#xD;
your dignity to tell you you're drunk, when I am&#xD;
drunk myself, and got drunk 'with you. Come,&#xD;
now, it shows malice-and I want to part friends&#xD;
with you. You don't think that I'd report such a&#xD;
thing of you, do you?"&#xD;
"I don't know what you may or will report,&#xD;
~ said Lusby, who did not seem to relish the&#xD;
execution of the threat, "I bear you no malice, sir."&#xD;
"Well, then, will you drink with me?"&#xD;
"I thank. you, sir-no more for me."&#xD;
"Come, Mr. Lusby, it will be unkind if you do&#xD;
not. I respect you, sir, by earth I do, and we'll&#xD;
have a parting glass, at any rate. You may ap-&#xD;
pear against me or not-it can't ruin me anyhow,&#xD;
and if it does ruin the old woman, let the sin be&#xD;
yours.~~&#xD;
"Let's drop the subject, Master Booth," said&#xD;
Lusby, rising, "but, sir, to show you that I bear&#xD;
no enmity, I'll drink with you."&#xD;
Again they drank together, after which, Booth&#xD;
said he must be off, and shaking Lusby by the hand&#xD;
cordially, he departed. Lusby~s house was about&#xD;
a mile through the fields from the grocery, which&#xD;
he left with a staggering step an hour afterwards.&#xD;
tn the midnight, the neighborhood was startled&#xD;
by a fire in the direction of the school-house. The&#xD;
people rushed to the spot, and found it and the ad-&#xD;
joining cabin in flames, and so far consumed as to&#xD;
make an attempt at an entrance extremely hazard-&#xD;
ous. In fact, the dwelling of Lusby was the most&#xD;
burnt. The conjecture was, that the fire was the&#xD;
work of an incendiary, and the inquiry ran round&#xD;
for the s~hoolmaster. He was not to be found.&#xD;
The lookers on, for they were all such, as they had&#xD;
no engines with which to work, and there was&#xD;
nothing of value that they could save, now gath&#xD;
ered closer to the flames and cinders, and attempted&#xD;
to pry through them, but in vain.&#xD;
&#xD;
WILLIAM&#xD;
&#xD;
As the dying conflagration flickered across the&#xD;
solemn shades of night, some mounted their&#xD;
horses, on which they had galloped to the place,&#xD;
and took their way home; ~while others, in scat-&#xD;
tered groups, discussed the cause of the fire and&#xD;
the probable fate of the master, and lingered about&#xD;
till day break. In the morning nothing but a&#xD;
smouldering mass of ashes was perceptible on the&#xD;
spot where the school-house had stood. On raking&#xD;
in their midst, the bones of Lushy were found.&#xD;
There was much wonder at first why thesehool-&#xD;
master did not make his escape, but it died away&#xD;
when the bar-keeper stated that Lusby was intoxi-&#xD;
cated that nbrht, which fact was corroborated by&#xD;
Booth. The schoolmaster's last night furnished&#xD;
the bar-keeper with a fund of gossip, and he often&#xD;
recounted the scene as I have recorded it.&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
MY A UNT ~s GRIEF FOR THE DEATH OF LUSEY-&#xD;
I AM SENT TO A NEW SCHOOL-CHARACTER&#xD;
OF THE CELEBRATED) JOSEPH LANCASTER-&#xD;
MY FIRST LOVE-A CHILDREN'S PARTY AT MRS.&#xD;
RECITATiON- MY TRI-&#xD;
UMPH OVER HIM.&#xD;
My good relative mourned much more for the loss&#xD;
'of the school house than for the pedagogue-tern.&#xD;
ble as his death must have been. She reflected&#xD;
that if the school house still stood, that another&#xD;
teacher could soon be found, but the school house!&#xD;
who would rebuild that. To be sure, it would not&#xD;
cost a great deal, but the parents of Lusby's&#xD;
scholars were generally poor, and there was no one&#xD;
to step forward, (as there doubtless would have&#xD;
been had the conflagration occurred in Yankee&#xD;
land,) and rebuild the house, or at least raise a&#xD;
subscription among the neighbors, and have it done&#xD;
in that way.&#xD;
As Lusby had flattered my aunt's pride that I&#xD;
was a bright boy, she determined that I should not&#xD;
be idle. The question was, how could she pre-&#xD;
serve her health, and send nie to school in the city,&#xD;
where, during the summer, she was not in the&#xD;
habit of residing. She resolved to board me with&#xD;
her old friend, Mrs. Clayton. Accordingly, a~er&#xD;
many interviews ~nd negotiations between the two,&#xD;
&#xD;
RUSSELL.                                 19&#xD;
I was packed off to Mrs. Clayton. Perhaps I&#xD;
should speak more in accordance with my relatives'&#xD;
kindness to me, to say, that with every care she&#xD;
herself took me to Mrs. Clayton's; and there sent&#xD;
for Joseph Lancaster, the celebrated founder of the&#xD;
Lancasterian system of education, under whose tui-&#xD;
tion she designed to place me. Lancaster, under,&#xD;
I believe, reverses of fortune, had left England&#xD;
and at the time I speak of had located in Baltimore.&#xD;
Well do I remember his pompous appearance be-&#xD;
fore my aunt, in a suit of drab, of the quaker cut,&#xD;
as prinky and particular in its adjustment as that of&#xD;
any Broadway or Chesnut street dandy whatever.&#xD;
"I~'riend Hugerson,~~ was his salutation to my&#xD;
aunt, "when I give thee my hand I give thee my&#xD;
heart also."&#xD;
Learnedly, as my aunt thought, the old peda-&#xD;
gogue went into an exposition of his plan of educa-&#xD;
tion, while he puffed and blew like a locomotive,&#xD;
only his respirations were at longer intervals.&#xD;
To Lancaster I went. I have forgotten all he&#xD;
ever attempted to learn me, but I have not forgotten&#xD;
the fact, that, young as I was, I soon learned to&#xD;
consider him a humbug. The old fellow was al-&#xD;
ways cramming himself, not with readingorscience,&#xD;
but with the nicest kind of sponge cakes, as puffy&#xD;
as himself. Lie was sparse of any distribution of&#xD;
these creature~omforts among the boys, but I have&#xD;
always thought he delighted to see our mouths&#xD;
water as he stowed away quantities of the cakes&#xD;
aforesaid. These sponge cakes were his standard&#xD;
refreshment, but he not infrequently slipped down&#xD;
to the confectioner's and regaled himself with&#xD;
other dainties, with divers and sundry glasses of&#xD;
wine to boot.&#xD;
Ah! my firatdream of love was learned, it not at&#xD;
his~school, nor after the Lancasterian or any other&#xD;
system, it was certainly in the natural way. After&#xD;
the conflagration of Lusby's, I missed much Martha&#xD;
Jones in our new school, for I had always a boyish&#xD;
penchant for her, and had ever done my boyish best&#xD;
to please her, not without effect. For when aunt&#xD;
sent for m~ to spend the holiday of Saturda~f and&#xD;
Sunday in the country, Martha, young as she waa,&#xD;
would frequently come over from Mrs. Baltzell's to&#xD;
see me, and the folks used to call her my sweet&#xD;
heart. But I heard an old family female slave say,&#xD;
"that it would not do no how-thQugh it was a&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC8021-00000009"/>&#xD;
20&#xD;
&#xD;
pity there was such a dIfference in our stations,"&#xD;
(Martha's and mine.)&#xD;
I did not know what~ she meant then by the&#xD;
remark, though I have learned since.&#xD;
Not far from Lancaster's school, Mrs. Grace&#xD;
kept hers, and it was in full operation. Among&#xD;
her scholars was a beautiful little girl, named Alice&#xD;
Clare. Her parents were very rich, and Alice&#xD;
was the admiration of all the boys at Lancaster's,&#xD;
and not the less of mine. Lancaster in the morn-&#xD;
ing of Saturday,,(for in the afternoon we had holi-&#xD;
day) taught elocution, or rather listened to our re-&#xD;
citations, for though he sometimes gave us a pre-&#xD;
cept or two, he never illustrated them by practice.&#xD;
I had a natural turn for speaking, as Lusby used&#xD;
to say, and I generally headed my class in elocu-&#xD;
tion, when the lines&#xD;
"You'll scarce expect one of my age,"&#xD;
were certainly recited either by one 0" the small-&#xD;
est boys in downright earnest, or by one of the&#xD;
largest and most lubberly ones in sport. I always&#xD;
made earnest of my recitations, and was fond of a&#xD;
pathetic effusion, such as the "Exile of Erin," or&#xD;
a love matter, like "Byron's Dream," (I thought&#xD;
myself prodigious at this, or something from Shak-&#xD;
speare; Mark Antony~s oration, for instance, over&#xD;
Caesar, or Cassius to Brutus.) I never once at-&#xD;
tempted the comic, except Captain Bobadil's kill-&#xD;
ing off an army by computation, in Ben Jonson's&#xD;
"Every man in his humor."&#xD;
At a rival academy (Brown's,) a boy three or&#xD;
four yeare older than myself had won the prize in&#xD;
elocution; and young Mr. Peterson was proud in-&#xD;
deed of the award. I used to observe him with no&#xD;
little curiosity after I had heard of his success, and&#xD;
the more so, when I heard the girls talk about, and&#xD;
certain ones boast of him as their beau. My anx-&#xD;
iety to hear him was intense. He was great in I&#xD;
"Hohenlinden" it was observed; and some of the&#xD;
girls declared that they could almost see&#xD;
"-the brave,&#xD;
Who rush to glory or the grave,"&#xD;
"rushing," when he recited the lines.&#xD;
At a girl's party in the neighborhood, Alice&#xD;
Clare had heard Peterson recite, and she was loud&#xD;
in his praise. The girls at Lancaster's, however,&#xD;
feeling a pride in their school, proclaimed my&#xD;
&#xD;
merits, and said that they believed I could beat&#xD;
him. In the midst of these earnest and emulous&#xD;
differences of opinion, quite as grave as differences&#xD;
upon graver matters, Alice Clare gave a party, to&#xD;
which both Peterson and myself were invited,&#xD;
Naturally of a sensitive nature, I felt more sensi-&#xD;
tive than ever, as I eyed the manlier proportions of&#xD;
Master Peterson, and observed how he lionized it&#xD;
among the fair. He had his collar turned over,&#xD;
quite in the Byronic way, and he wore a watch, a&#xD;
point of manly extravagance to which I was scarce-&#xD;
ly approximating. IMoreover, the whole appoint-&#xD;
ments of his toilet surpassed, not only mine, but&#xD;
those of every other boy in the room. His parents&#xD;
were rich, and very indulgent to him. Why, his&#xD;
every day clothes are as good as my Sunday&#xD;
clothes, I thought to myself, and surely the girls&#xD;
admire him very much, but I should like to hear&#xD;
his "Hohenlinden."&#xD;
I had an instinct that I could heat him. Be that&#xD;
as it might, my curiosity to hear him was in-&#xD;
tense. I was seated in the corner by Alice Clare,&#xD;
our little hostess, and I remember now her dancing,&#xD;
black eye, arid the abundant display of raven curls,&#xD;
which floated over her neck and shoulders, and&#xD;
over the little edging of her frock in front, where&#xD;
L..ove's pillows&#xD;
"were but scarcely spied,&#xD;
For yet their places were but signified."&#xD;
I remember it all well-and how pleasantly she&#xD;
chatted with me, and kept calling me "Willy" Rus-&#xD;
sell, while she always spoke of the distinguished&#xD;
elocutionist of Brown's as "Mr." Peterson. I was&#xD;
not old enough to know then, that "Willy Rus-&#xD;
sell," the way she pronounced it, had much more&#xD;
in it than "Mr. Peterson." I only thought that old&#xD;
Lancaster gave no prizes for elocution, and that&#xD;
Brown did, and Peterson had won the prize, and&#xD;
all the girls were admiring him. I glanced at&#xD;
Alice's glowing Gheek, and felt a strange, wild&#xD;
envy and emulation seize me. Hear him I must.&#xD;
Alice and I sat in the corner.&#xD;
"Do, Miss Alice, ask Mr. Peterson to recite," I&#xD;
said.&#xD;
"0! yes,~~ rejoined Alice, clapping her hands,&#xD;
"and, Willy Russell, you must recite too."&#xD;
I remarked 'with some hauteur, "I never won a&#xD;
prize for elocution."&#xD;
&#xD;
"But that old mean thing, Lancaster, don't give&#xD;
prizes at your school, Willy Russell, and if he&#xD;
did, somehow I think you might win it. I never&#xD;
heard you, but your school girls have, and I heard&#xD;
Martha Jones, when I was out to Mrs. Stetson's,&#xD;
ask you to repeat some poetry to her, and she says&#xD;
you can do it so well."&#xD;
"Mr. Peterson," she called out that individual,&#xD;
"do recite for us."&#xD;
But Mr. Peterson, a spoilt pet, required as&#xD;
much persuasion to get him on the floor as it would&#xD;
to have seated at the piano some celebrated song-&#xD;
stress. At last the honored winner of the prize&#xD;
took the floor, but without the least show of diffi-&#xD;
dence. He adjusted his Byronic collar, and dain-&#xD;
tily asked what Miss Alice Clare's commands&#xD;
were.&#xD;
"Do recite Hohenlinden," was the cry from all&#xD;
parts of the room.&#xD;
Mr. Peterson averred that Hohenlinden was not,&#xD;
by any means, his crack piece-but it was imma-&#xD;
terial to him, any thing to please the ladies, and&#xD;
particularly Miss Alice Clare.&#xD;
Though I was rather a precocious chap myself,&#xD;
the coolness and the style of Mr. Peterson aston-&#xD;
ished me. I thought his manner to the young la-&#xD;
dies, (ladies was the word that pressed itself upon&#xD;
my brain, and not girls,) was inimitable. If,&#xD;
thought I to myself, he recites as well as he said&#xD;
that, he deserved the prize, and my heart swelled&#xD;
as truth extorted the remark from envy.&#xD;
And Mr. Peterson did recite, and well. There&#xD;
was evidently too much study in his recitations,&#xD;
but there was evident also a great deal of taste.&#xD;
Bowing with the easy courtesy of some histrionic&#xD;
"particular star," who has been so long the light&#xD;
of the theatrical world, that men have become, as it&#xD;
were, astronomers of his fame, and he himself used&#xD;
to the thing - Mr. Peterson resumed his seat&#xD;
and his conversation with the young lady beside&#xD;
him at the same instant, as if he had been doing&#xD;
nothing but holding a quiet chat with her the whole&#xD;
evening. Again his coolness and manner provoked&#xD;
while it struck me, and I believe 1 envied him his&#xD;
nonchakrnt address, which was cotifoundedly taking&#xD;
after all, more than his powers of recitation.&#xD;
"Now, Willy Russell," said Alice in an under&#xD;
tone to rue, "yot~ must recite. Ladies and gentle-&#xD;
&#xD;
21&#xD;
&#xD;
nen," continued Mass Alice, with~quite a womanly&#xD;
;elf-possession, (these things are catching,) "now&#xD;
~dr. Russell will recite. Please, Mr. Russell, to&#xD;
recite the "Exile of Erin."&#xD;
I, however, could not catch Mr. Peterson's&#xD;
xiolness, for I shook all over. I glanced at Alice,&#xD;
her encouraging look nerved me, and I proceeded.&#xD;
I remember when I recited the verse:&#xD;
"Where is my cabin door fast by the wild wood,&#xD;
Sisters and sire did ye weep for its fall?&#xD;
Where is the mother that looked on my childhood,&#xD;
~5nd where is the bosom friend dearer than all?"&#xD;
that I gave particular emphasis to the last line,&#xD;
looking with might and main at Alice, and doing&#xD;
my best to make actions speak even louder than&#xD;
words. Alice blushed crimson at this, and when&#xD;
I had concluded, Mr; Peterson declared, with an&#xD;
air of some pique, that I had made quite a declar-&#xD;
ation, as well as declamation.&#xD;
"I vow, Mr. Peterson," she said hastily, "VViI-&#xD;
ly Russell can beat you after all."&#xD;
Mr. Peterson's particular coolness forsook him at&#xD;
this remark, and he said hastily and abruptly,&#xD;
there was no accounting for taste. Dc gustibus,&#xD;
&amp;amp;c., and he quoted Latin, while I became in man-&#xD;
ner, at least, particularly cool, though my heart&#xD;
throbbed wildly at the praise of Alice. And I be-&#xD;
gan to feel, boy as I was, whenever Alice looked&#xD;
kindly on any other youth in the room, what the&#xD;
poet has since most beautifully illustrated:&#xD;
"The moon looks&#xD;
On many brooks-&#xD;
The brook can see no moon but one."&#xD;

INC RENCONTRE-I AM CARRiED INTO CAP-&#xD;
TVViTY-A BOUQUET SENT ME-THE ARRIVAL&#xD;
OF MY AUNT-i PRRVAiL-PEACE PROCLAIMED.&#xD;
There was quite a rebellion in Mrs. Clayton's&#xD;
household in the morning after Alice Clare's party,&#xD;
at least on the part of one person. 1 made my ap-&#xD;
pearance at breakfast with the clothes which I had&#xD;
worn to the party, my best clothcs,(my Sunday-go-to&#xD;
meeting clothes.) to wear to school-a thing never&#xD;
tolerated, unless. my every day clothes were torn&#xD;
and were being mended. Mrs. Clayton looked at&#xD;

THE AUTOB~O~RAPUY OF&#xD;
&#xD;
we with much surprise, and asked me why I did&#xD;
not wear ray school clothes?&#xD;
"Because they are not fit to wear," I replied.&#xD;
"Not fit to wear! are they torn, child? Gracious,&#xD;
I only mended them yesterday."&#xD;
That "child" I did'nt like, so I replied as much&#xD;
like a man as I could.&#xD;
"I don't know whether they are torn or not, but&#xD;
I won't wear them any more."&#xD;
"Not wear them any more," screamed the old&#xD;
lady, "why your dear aunt left express orders that&#xD;
you should never wear your Sunday clothes except&#xD;
on the blessed Sabbath, or on extra occasions, such&#xD;
as last night-this is her return for sending them&#xD;
into town. to you."&#xD;
I disdained a reply. I had been awake half the&#xD;
night, thinking over the party, what Alice had&#xD;
said about my beating Peterson, and particularly&#xD;
about that gentleman~s superior wardrobe appoint-&#xD;
ments, watch, &amp;amp;c., and I felt that I must do justice&#xD;
to myself and dress better thereafter.&#xD;
The old lady saw my stubbornness, but she was&#xD;
stubborn too, or rather, as she said, she was deter-&#xD;
mined to fulfill her dear friend Miss Ilugerson's&#xD;
desires to the very letter. Accordingly, I was trapp-&#xD;
ed, unawares, by herself and black girl, and in spite&#xD;
of all my efforts at kicking and scratching, I was&#xD;
carried screaming with passion to my room, and&#xD;
locked in. Notwithstanding portentous struggles&#xD;
on my part, against the combined forces of Mrs.&#xD;
Cla~rton and her black ally, I was stripped of my&#xD;
Sunday suit, the suit in which I had excelled&#xD;
Mr. Peterson, and I was peremptorily told by Mrs.&#xD;
Clayton, as she deposited my every day clothes&#xD;
beside my bed, into which she had thrust me, that&#xD;
until I put them on, she could not think of permitt-&#xD;
ing me to leave the room and go to school. Saying&#xD;
this she left the room, carefully locking the door&#xD;
after her.&#xD;
At first, from exhaustion, surprise, and indigna-&#xD;
tion, I was silent for some moments after the old&#xD;
lady left me, or my silence was only broken by&#xD;
sobs. But my wrath was soon aroused into activi-&#xD;
ty. I stamped and raved about the room; I jerked&#xD;
at the knob of the door, and dashed myself against&#xD;
its panels in a furious but impotent outbreak of&#xD;
&#xD;
the key hole and distinctly informed me, through&#xD;
it, that she would send for the constable if I made&#xD;
any more noise, that the people had collected out&#xD;
in the street, and that I should not have a mouth-&#xD;
ful until I behaved myself and put on my clothes.&#xD;
I looked out of the window and saw several per.&#xD;
sons looking up at it, and while I was wondering&#xD;
what&amp;amp; I should do, one of my schoolmates, who&#xD;
was in the habit of calling occasionally for me,&#xD;
made his appearance at the door below, with a&#xD;
bunch of flowers in his hand. My first impulse&#xD;
was hurniediy to dress myself and go wit to meet&#xD;
hini-but no, the idea of giving up to Mrs. Clayton&#xD;
could not be borne. So I stole away from the&#xD;
window, bun presently hearing the frontdoor open,&#xD;
I crept to it again and looked forth. I beheld Mrs.&#xD;
Clayton and my comrade talking together, and I&#xD;
saw him offer her the bunch of flowers, which she&#xD;
seemed to refuse, and at the same time pointed to&#xD;
my window. In my eagerness to see what was&#xD;
going on, for I could not hear, I had exposed my-&#xD;
self to the observation of the old lady. My school-&#xD;
mate burst into a laugh and called out loud enough&#xD;
for me to hear:&#xD;
"Bill, come down, old fellow-here's some flow-&#xD;
ers Alice sent you.~~&#xD;
"Put on your clothes, as I bid you," screamed&#xD;
out Mrs. Clayton, "and come to your breakfast."&#xD;
At this moment Alice Clare passed by, on the&#xD;
other side of the street, and I heard Mrs. Clayton&#xD;
call her over. I heard no more. In an utter&#xD;
I&#xD;
agony of shame and rage I threw myself on the ~&#xD;
bed. I believe I would willingly have set the ~.&#xD;
house on fire and perished in it, rather than the&#xD;
old lady should expose the cause of my rebellion, I&#xD;
and dwell upon my denuded state, locked up as I&#xD;
was in my room, to Alice. I really felt like dash-&#xD;
ing my brains out against the wall. I thought ~&#xD;
that when Alice left, I would actually pitch my-&#xD;
self out of the window, in revenge upon every&#xD;
body about me. Strange-but wildly flitted&#xD;
through my mind Booth's revenge on Lusby,&#xD;
and for the first time, [wondered if Booth could&#xD;
have set fire to the school house and burnt the old&#xD;
rascal up? And then I wondered if he loved&#xD;
Martha Jones as much as I loved Alice Clare, and&#xD;
&#xD;
passion. The door gave not way, nor would Mrs. ~then I began to reflect that I loved Martha Jones&#xD;
Clayton give up, for she made her appearance at too, and that if Alice Clare should laugh at rue&#xD;
&#xD;
Martha Jones would not, as she had always taken&#xD;
my part.&#xD;
In the hurly-burly of such thoughts I fell a-&#xD;
sleep. I knew ~ot how long I had slept when I&#xD;
was aroused by Mrs. Clayton, who had entered&#xD;
the room without awaking mc. She told me I&#xD;
had better get up and have something to eat. I&#xD;
turned away from her without saying a word. She&#xD;
then began to remonstrate with me and said I would&#xD;
make myself sick. I only reflected that Alice&#xD;
knew all about my trouble, that the boys at school&#xD;
would laugh at me. I told Mrs. Clayton that I&#xD;
wouldn't wear my Sunday clothes, if she were to&#xD;
bring them to me, that I wanted to be sent home&#xD;
to my aunt. At this the old lady seemed non-&#xD;
plussed. She now began to coax. But this only&#xD;
made me more stubborn, like the "rude boy up the&#xD;
apple tree," when the farmer expostulated with&#xD;
him. At last the old lady left the room, and the&#xD;
door unlocked behind her, but that did no good. I&#xD;
felt my advantage. She even brought me, towards&#xD;
evening, something to eat, but I stubbornly re-&#xD;
fused it. She then brought me ipy Sunday clothes,&#xD;
averring that she could do nothing with me, and&#xD;
told me to put them on and do what I pleased.&#xD;
But I threw them from the bed on which she had&#xD;
placed them. The old lady left the room at this&#xD;
in a quandary. I glanced at the plate of fo6d which&#xD;
she had left behind her, and notwithstanding I was&#xD;
very hungry, I would not touch it. I looked at&#xD;
my Sunday clothes and thought I would put them&#xD;
on and go and see Alice, and that would show her&#xD;
at least I had triumphed over the old hag, for in&#xD;
such colors my indignation painted Mrs. Clayton,&#xD;
but then I reflected, Alice and the boys will laugh&#xD;
at me, notwithstanding, and maybe nickname mc&#xD;
"Sunday clothes!" 0! thought I, if I were only&#xD;
out an the country at Mr. Stetson's. 1 never want&#xD;
to see town again.&#xD;
I was oppressed with such reflections and over-&#xD;
whelrned with the ridiculous point of view in which&#xD;
Mrs. Clayton had doubtless placed me in the eyes&#xD;
of my schoolmate and Alice, when Mrs. Clayton&#xD;
entered my room, followed by my aunt. I was&#xD;
unconscious that hours had passed, and in the&#xD;
meantime Mrs. Clayton had sent for my aunt.&#xD;
Both the old ladies viewed and reviewed me,&#xD;
through their spectacles, as I lay doggedly in bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
My rebellion was a grave matter to arise from such&#xD;
a little matter as the wearing of a certain enit. But&#xD;
my ambition had been awakened, and there was&#xD;
something deeper in it than dandyistri. I have&#xD;
often thought since that it was a trait of character,&#xD;
which, at first blush, would seem born of the bio-&#xD;
graphy of beau Brummel.&#xD;
"My poor boy, what has come over you,~~ said&#xD;
my good aunt, in a kind tone. "Mrs. Clam rode&#xD;
out to Mr. Stetson's and gave such pleasing ac-&#xD;
counts of you; she said you recited better than Mr.&#xD;
Brown's scholar, who got the prize. And what&#xD;
gratified me more, she said you were the mast&#xD;
gentlemanly lad at the party."&#xD;
"Yes, but," I exclaimed, utterly subdued by my&#xD;
aunt's kindness, "Mrs. Clayton has gone and told&#xD;
Alice and Jim Johnson that she had locked me&#xD;
up like a baby, because I wouldn't wear my old&#xD;
clothes."&#xD;
"I never said such a word, Miss Huge~son,~~ ex-&#xD;
claimed Mrs. Clayton, "Alice, that beautiful little&#xD;
girl, had sent him a bouquet, and all I said was that&#xD;
Willy was in his room, and hadn't been to break-&#xD;
fast yet."&#xD;
"Then i'll wear my old clothes and be hanged&#xD;
to them, aunt," I exclaimed, as I stretched out my&#xD;
hand to take them, "but I don't see why, if I can&#xD;
beat Mr. Peterson, emphasisingg the Mr.) he&#xD;
should wear better clothes than I ~&#xD;
"Well, Willy,~~ rejoined my aunt, "in consid-&#xD;
eration that you behaved so well at the party and&#xD;
did surpass Mr. Brown's scholar, (my aunt never&#xD;
liked Brown, he had corrected her pronunciation&#xD;
once,) you shall wear your Sunday suit daily--but&#xD;
you ought to have minded Mrs. Clayton."&#xD;
"I didn't mean to make Mrs. Clayton angry,&#xD;
aunt," said 1, "she has always been good to me,"&#xD;
and I suspect that the fear Mrs. Clayton might&#xD;
tell Alice of the cause of my rebellion induced me&#xD;
to make thus much of an apology, rather than the&#xD;
fact that she had "always been good to me." But&#xD;
it will not do to analyze the motives too closely&#xD;
even of a boy.&#xD;
It was now nearly dark, and for the nonce I&#xD;
dressed myself in my old clothes, and went down&#xD;
stairs to take tea with the two old ladies, who, I&#xD;
believe, both looked on rae with admiring eyes.&#xD;
I consumed a considerable quantity of tea, toast&#xD;

and cold ham that night. While the old ladies ges&#xD;
siped away the hour, I laid myself at full length&#xD;
on the sofa and pursued a train of reflections, cloud:&#xD;
and bright by turns, but the bright predominated&#xD;
How much my passions expanded my mind in tha&#xD;
little hour! I began to think it was not very manl~&#xD;
to make such a fuss about what clothes I wore, at&#xD;
I had often heard that many men who had become&#xD;
great or rich, had often been very poor boys. Thea&#xD;
the magnificently dressed Mr. Peterson and hit&#xD;
watch, and his address, and his coolness, came be-&#xD;
tween me and a reconciliation '~'to~my old suit. I&#xD;
remembered hearing Mr. Stetson tell a story of a&#xD;
veteran of the revolution, who, when General&#xD;
Wilkinson had issued anorder that queues should&#xD;
be abolished in the army, refused to comply and was&#xD;
court mar~ialed for it. I did not understand what&#xD;
court martial meant, but I understood the gist of it&#xD;
was, that the old officer continued to wear his&#xD;
queue, 42~eneral Wilkinson to the contrary, notwith-&#xD;
standing. Moreover, the officer had carried the&#xD;
matter of his personal rights so far that on his&#xD;
death bed he made a friend promise him that a hole&#xD;
should be bored in the head of his coffin, and the&#xD;
obnoxious queue should make its appearance there-&#xD;
from unshorn from his head~, or its honors, and&#xD;
newly dressed. Accordingly, it did appear, and&#xD;
the commanding general, who attended the funeral,&#xD;
as in etiquette he was bound, was not a little of-&#xD;
fended to see the pugnacious article in question,&#xD;
like a martinet doing duty by its master, and emu-~&#xD;
lating Napoleon's guards, who refused to surren-&#xD;
der. Now, I said to myself, I always thought&#xD;
queues were ugly, and there are only one or two old&#xD;
men in the whole city that wear them; and if a&#xD;
brave soldier of the revolution ~vas determined to&#xD;
wear his queue, I do not see why I may not deter-&#xD;
mine to wear my best clothes.&#xD;
It seems that this old soldier, emulating in his&#xD;
maintenance of his personal rights Shakspeare's&#xD;
hero, in making a ~~bargain,~~ was determined to&#xD;
"cavil for the tythe part of an hair," and 1 suppose&#xD;
I mu~t have felt in his example a l)rccedent which&#xD;
upheld me, in my own opinion, at least, in "high-&#xD;
er matter," as Burke would say&#xD;

ADVENTURE AT MRS. CLAYTON'S SCROOL-t&#xD;
AM SERVED LIKE SOCRATES-MY CAPTURE-..&#xD;
MRS. CLAYTON IS SERVED LIKE SOCRATES TOO-.-&#xD;
I APPEAR IN THE POLICE REPORTS.&#xD;
If, unlike him of the ballad, I did not arise a&#xD;
"sadder" boy on the morrow, I certainly arose a&#xD;
"wiser" one, and I thought, as I glanced at my&#xD;
reflection in the glass, after I had equipped myself&#xD;
in my best suit, a much better looking one than I&#xD;
should have been in my old and discarded suit-&#xD;
"For the apparel oft proclaims the man,"&#xD;
said the wise Polonius to his son in that best of&#xD;
passages of advisement, to a youth, extant. Un-&#xD;
consciously caught by the quick suseptibilities of&#xD;
Love, quickened by 'Envy, I had adopted and&#xD;
acted upon it, thinking, foolishly, when my pas-&#xD;
sion, (against Mrs. Clayton, I mean,) had passed,&#xD;
that I had done something I should have been&#xD;
ashamed of, when in fact I had acted wisely. Old&#xD;
ladies, (unmarried, and who consequently have ro&#xD;
grandchildren that they can be proud of,) masters&#xD;
who furnish their apprentices clothing as well as&#xD;
food, and very economical timthers, might have some&#xD;
thing ~o say upon this subject, and quote Solomon&#xD;
upon 'vanity,' and 'sparing the rod and spoiling the&#xD;
child,'hut that would prove no more in my case than&#xD;
would the quotation to them from Shaksp~mare, about&#xD;
the "devil quoting scripture for his purpose," prove&#xD;
in theirs. I have a tale to tell, not as "'twas told&#xD;
to me," but as I acted and felt it, and I shall often&#xD;
leave the reader to his own reflections, without ob -&#xD;
truding mine. Funnily, through my boyish brain,&#xD;
kept running the lines of the poet upon thc adjust-&#xD;
ment of the devil's toilet, on the occasion of his&#xD;
taking his "Sunday morning" walk, for&#xD;
"The Prince of Darkness is a gentleman,"&#xD;
&#xD;
offence and my aunt's forgiveness, as I made my&#xD;
appearance before her and requested a note of ex-&#xD;
cuse to "old ~anky~~ for my absence. Now my&#xD;
aunt never had had to write me a note of excuse&#xD;
before, as Lusby, my country schoolmaster, never&#xD;
required one, and Mr. Lancaster had never asked&#xD;
me for one, though his rules demanded it, and I had&#xD;
frequently transgressed them in this particular as&#xD;
well as others.&#xD;
"Willy, I don't know what to say," replied my&#xD;
aunt, to my request.&#xD;
"I'll tell you aunt," I rejoined, for I had seen&#xD;
many of the excuses of the boys, and I proceeded&#xD;
to dictate to my respectable relative:&#xD;
"Mr. Lancaster will please excuse my nephew&#xD;
for his unavoidable absence.&#xD;
ELIZAnETII HUGERSON."&#xD;
"Unavoidable?" queried my aunt, in a conscien-&#xD;
tious tone, though she seemed to admire my rapid&#xD;
dictation.&#xD;
"Unavoidable?" echoed Mrs. Clayton, asif her&#xD;
moral sense was startled.&#xD;
"Yes, that's the very ord," said I, "I've seen&#xD;
it in other boy's excuses."&#xD;
"But it was not unavoidable," exclaimed Mrs.&#xD;
Clayton.&#xD;
"Necessary absence ~ said I.&#xD;
"But it wasn't necessary," said Mrs. Clayton.&#xD;
"Well, I don't want to have another foss,"&#xD;
said I, "so just put absence."&#xD;
Mrs. Clayton glanced at my aunt, who said'&#xD;
nothing, but wrote the note accordingly.&#xD;
With much elasticity of movement and spright-&#xD;
liness of step and spirit, I took my aunt's note, and~&#xD;
put it in my jacket pocket, which I got my aunt&#xD;
carefully to pin, with the pin through the note,&#xD;
that I might make it as secure as possible. I&#xD;
then stole into Mrs. Clayton's bed-room, which&#xD;
contained a larger glass than did mine~, and took a&#xD;
minute and admiring survey of myselL I felt ora-&#xD;
torical-declamatory. I was in the act of declaim-&#xD;
ing my favorite passage from Byron's dream:&#xD;
"As the sweet moon onthe horizon's verge,&#xD;
The maid was on the eve of womanhood;"&#xD;
determining, in my own mind, that the next time&#xD;
Alice asked me to recite I would select the dream&#xD;
and look at her when I declaimed that passage,&#xD;

from the "Exile of Erin" at her party.-when lo!&#xD;
the two old ladies entered and caught me in the&#xD;
act. Didn't I slip sheepishly out of the room? I&#xD;
paused on the steps and heard Mrs. Clayton say,&#xD;
tt was wrong to cultivate vanity in a child. But I&#xD;
darted off, re-assured, when I heard my aunt&#xD;
reply&#xD;
"It is indeed wrong to cultivate vanity in a child;&#xD;
I am, therefore, glad that my nephew was only&#xD;
cultivating a talent for oratory, for which every&#xD;
body says he has wonderful gifts-indeed, I think&#xD;
he'll turn out something extraordinary.~~&#xD;
Full of the conviction that I should turn out&#xD;
something extraordinary, I resolved to turn into&#xD;
the street where Mrs. Grace kept her school, in&#xD;
the hope of seeing Alice and being seen by her.&#xD;
Mrs. Grace, in teaching others, had taught hefacif,&#xD;
and had arrived to the dignity of an older grade of&#xD;
pupils than when I formed one of them. lint find-&#xD;
ing that this older grade, particularly those of the&#xD;
masculine gender, were harder to manage than the&#xD;
dunaller, she had resolved to have no more boys3&#xD;
but open an academy "exclusively for young la-&#xD;
dies," as the gilt sign over her door way official-&#xD;
ly announced. Alice Glare had become one ot&#xD;
bet pupils under this new arrangement. Alice had&#xD;
expressed her indignation, as I had heard from a&#xD;
playmate, when she was told that in days gone by,&#xD;
Mrs. Grace had put a fool's cap on me, and after-&#xD;
wards whipped me before the whole school for&#xD;
throwing it indignantly, in her face and running&#xD;
away.&#xD;
Mrs. Grace's school was kept in a small house&#xD;
situated on the corner of an alley. The school&#xD;
room was on the first floor, and a low window&#xD;
opened from it into the alley, into which I buoy-&#xD;
antly entered, and seeing Alice Glare in the school&#xD;
room, an not seeing Mrs~ Grace, I took off my&#xD;
hat and made her my best bow with my best&#xD;
beaver. She was looking out of the window at&#xD;
the time, and involuntary exclaimed, when she&#xD;
saw me:&#xD;
"Why, Willy!"&#xD;
This attracted the attention of' the young Misses&#xD;
about her, and a buzz ran round the room. Mrs.&#xD;
Grace, it dppears. was up stairs in her chamber, so&#xD;
situated at the head of the stairs that she could&#xD;
comn~an(l a vieW of the school-room. Hearing the&#xD;

buzz, the old lady reconnoitered the school.roon&#xD;
Seeing the eyes of 'her pupils directed to the alle&#xD;
window, she naturally stepped to her window jum&#xD;
over it, and reconnoitered the premises within'&#xD;
She behold me infringing all her rules of propriety&#xD;
and decorum in making my third most decorous&#xD;
mind profound bow to the young ladies within.&#xD;
Mrs. Grace instantly resolved to put a stop&#xD;
my bowing, as they put out fires, and sometime&#xD;
put down mobs and other projects, and sometime&#xD;
don't, by throwing cold water on them. No soon&#xD;
er resolved than done. As I raised my head fron&#xD;
my fourth most profound bow, it was arrested ii&#xD;
its upward tendency, and suddenly thrown down&#xD;
wards with a jerk and shake, by a shower of dirtl&#xD;
water from a basin in the hands of Mrs. Grace&#xD;
who was acting with malice aforethought evidently&#xD;
for as I looked up naturally and impulsively to se&#xD;
what was the matter, jumping back at the saint&#xD;
instant, I received another shower full in my fac&#xD;
and eyes. I had opened my mouth involuntarily&#xD;
and that came in for more than its full share. Foi&#xD;
a moment the water, to say nothing 'of the shoch&#xD;
to my sensibilities and nerves, made me speechless,&#xD;
when a burst of laughter from the whole school&#xD;
stung ~ne to the qui&amp;amp;k. I retreated beyond the&#xD;
reach of at least another shower from my Xantippe,&#xD;
and shook my fist at her in a rage, and called her&#xD;
certain names, with bad words appended to them,&#xD;
which I need not repeat.&#xD;
She told me that I was born for the gallows, and&#xD;
that if I did not instantly leave she would send&#xD;
her black girl (my old arrester when I ran away&#xD;
from my coronation) after me, and whip me before&#xD;
the whole "academy." What a threat!-to be&#xD;
unbreeched before a whole "academy exclusively&#xD;
for young ladies," and Alice iii their midst. I de-&#xD;
fied her. I could not do less, and my wrath rose&#xD;
into manly imprecations.&#xD;
"Oh! Willy Russell, don't go on so-do go to&#xD;
school," said Alice to me.&#xD;
"Alice, I will, for you," I said, and just as [turn-&#xD;
ed to leave the alley, the black imp of Mrs. Grace&#xD;
darted thrciugh the back door at me. Horror, fear,&#xD;
~nd indignation had me at once, and the black&#xD;
ttirl too had me at an advantage. I turned and&#xD;
ran to save my 'honor-if nothing else-tiH in say-&#xD;
&#xD;
. ing my back I saved certainly my honor itt the&#xD;
y premises, because, according to Hudibras.&#xD;
"A wourid in that place more&#xD;
Hurts honor than deep wounds before"&#xD;
Y "Run, Willy," irtvoluntarily exclaimed Alice&#xD;
5 Glare.&#xD;
I did run. Being rather scant in the skirt~,&#xD;
o upon economical principles, the locomotion of the&#xD;
s black girl was somewhat impeded, and at first I&#xD;
5 gained ground upon her. But she raised the cry&#xD;
- of stop thief after me, and a large man at the mouth&#xD;
ri of the alley seized me.&#xD;
"Let me go," I exclaimed, frantic with fright&#xD;
- ~and passion.&#xD;
"Bring him in,~' exclaimed Mrs. Grace, "if you&#xD;
please."&#xD;
I was accordingly forcibly taken by the collar&#xD;
by the individual addressed, and hauled into the&#xD;
presence of Mrs. Grace. My delinquency was&#xD;
stated by the lady to my captor, and she asserted,&#xD;
and was borne out in the assertion, that I had&#xD;
made "indecent mouths" at the young ladies, by&#xD;
several of them. Alice Clare had the courage to&#xD;
say that I was only bowing t', her.&#xD;
Mrs. Grace said that I should apologise, or be&#xD;
whipped before the whole academy.&#xD;
The black girl said:&#xD;
"Missus, he ought to do bofth. I can hold him&#xD;
spite of his kicking-I has held him 'afore."&#xD;
"She has no right, I don't belong to her school,"&#xD;
I exclaimed to the man, "take me to Mr. Lancas-&#xD;
ter's, where I belong, or to my aunt." I could&#xD;
have stood a thousand whippings, but not before&#xD;
the girls.&#xD;
"Mr. Gunter, Willy was only bowing to me,"&#xD;
said Alice Clare, who, it seems, knew the man,&#xD;
who had lately become her father's gardener, "take&#xD;
him home," and she burst into tears.&#xD;
"Silence, Miss Glare," exclaimed ~rs. Grace~&#xD;
Gunter asked me what I had done. I told him&#xD;
that I had only bowed to Alice. He decided that I&#xD;
should be taken to my aunt, and Mrs. Grace hur-&#xD;
riedly equipped herself and accompanied us, fol-&#xD;
lowed by the black girl.&#xD;
I shall never forget the look of my aunt and&#xD;
Mrs. Clayton when Mrs. Grace told how I had in-&#xD;
merrupted her school, made indecent mouths at the&#xD;
girls, and how she had to throw water on me to&#xD;

&#xD;
when she was faltering in her task, and such&#xD;
smile of encouragement, and so many words&#xD;
praise! Jane was about sixteen, quiet and sh&#xD;
with deep blue eyes, and she was graceful at&#xD;
womanly even at that age. I delighted to talk&#xD;
her about Hanson. And when I would tell h&#xD;
what he said of her, the delicate rose-tint won&#xD;
come to her cheek as you trace it in the rose wh&#xD;
the wind lifts its head to the light. I tell yor&#xD;
sir, or miss or madam, it is very much in ti&#xD;
power of a handsome, insinuating teacher, be 11&#xD;
teacher of grammar or music, or what not, to teac&#xD;
young ladies other lore than is written. I ofte&#xD;
since, in looking at life, have seen this, as doubi&#xD;
less you have.&#xD;
Jane knew that her parents would object to he&#xD;
marriage with Hanson, but she loved him, neve&#xD;
theless, and it tore her very heart strings to giv&#xD;
him up. She grew thin, and that pallor about th&#xD;
temples which so strongly denotes mental suffering1&#xD;
marked hers.&#xD;
I did not think that Hanson loved her over-much&#xD;
It was said that he was engaged. to a lady in Bos&#xD;
ton, and the day at last arrived' when he was ti&#xD;
leave for that plase. He had never said that h&#xD;
was to be married, but always after a fashion de&#xD;
nied it.&#xD;
He was popular with the scholars, and many or&#xD;
both sexes, from both schools, had agreed to mccl&#xD;
him in our school rcoin to say good bye Of course&#xD;
Alice, Jane, and myself were of the number. We&#xD;
had a nice little collation spread, and there was a&#xD;
great deal of fun and gayety among us, but,&#xD;
Jane's fair face was like the Death's head at a&#xD;
feast; a remembrancer that sorrow is everywhere.&#xD;
Hanson seemed quietly to watch her, though&#xD;
he often repeated gayly that he would soon return.&#xD;
When the good bye came, Hanson went to Jane&#xD;
first. He' took her hand and said:&#xD;
"Farewell......do~'t forget me."&#xD;
She silently took his hand, and he passed on to&#xD;
the rest. When he ha4 bade adieu to all and was&#xD;
leaving, ~vith a wild sob Jane threw herself into his&#xD;
arms.&#xD;
EC~IJ~Jfl said a funny fellow, ~named Horslcy,&#xD;
jumping up on to the table, "here's another new&#xD;
system of education-I prefer it to the Lancaster-&#xD;
jan plan."&#xD;
&#xD;

of true love, in which I proclaimed myself a be-&#xD;

am alluding to his departure from the Monumental&#xD;
city, which, however, was final,) I had to say he&#xD;
would come back certainly. But I had a strange&#xD;
misgiving all the while.&#xD;

heart, as in a sepulchre, burns that flame of love&#xD;
which the false-hearted lighted to leave beside&#xD;

TAKE 1111W AT AN ADVANTAGE-HIS PUNISHMENT-&#xD;
HE MEDITATES REVENGE.&#xD;
Horaley was a character. A slim, sly fellow,&#xD;
with a face like a deacon's, and with as much fun&#xD;
in him as in Foote or Matthews. His name was&#xD;
Samuel, but he occasionally went by the name of&#xD;
"old floss," partly because it was a kind of play&#xD;
upon his name, but mostly because of his great ap-&#xD;
parent gravity and peculiar traits of character.&#xD;
He had a great deal of address and manner too,&#xD;
but he would have his joke upon all occasions, and&#xD;
almost every thing, grave or gay, furnished him&#xD;
with a jest, but he was gallant and true.&#xD;
His father was a bookseller, and a member of the&#xD;
church. There lived itear him a fancy store keep-&#xD;
er, who might be called a monomaniac on the sub-&#xD;
ject of cock-fighting, which, at the time I write of,&#xD;
was a sport a good deal indulged in, in Baltimore&#xD;
and its vicinity. I could* point out now, on the&#xD;
York road, (for I must review these old scenes&#xD;
again some of these days,) a house oa the right&#xD;
hand side, just above Jenkin's tan yard, where the&#xD;
sport was practiced. I remember riding out to&#xD;
Mr. Stetson's in a lime cart one Saturday, and&#xD;
stopping there with the driver, an old negro who&#xD;
belonged to Governor Ridgicy, of Hampton. I&#xD;
treated him for the ride, and he explained to me&#xD;
the art and mystery of cock-fighting, which was&#xD;
going on in a cock pit in the yard of the house,&#xD;
which was a road-side grocery. I liked not the&#xD;
sport, and I wondered how two fowls could fight&#xD;
each other for nothing; but after all there was&#xD;
something in the pitted courage of the two&#xD;
cocks, who fought for victory, unconscious that&#xD;
they had backers and that there were lookers on.&#xD;
No wonder then that men, who have backers and&#xD;
lookers on, should fight for victory without having&#xD;
at heart as much game as these cocks in the pit.&#xD;
Though the cocks, perchance, deserve more credit.&#xD;
as *their valor is of a more unadulterated and&#xD;
&#xD;
sophisticatedd character. I hope it is not so now,.&#xD;
hough John Randolph said th'at when there was&#xD;
~ock fighting and horse racing in Virginia there were&#xD;
~entIemen in Virginia, and the eccentric Virginian&#xD;
would doubtless apply the same remark to Mary-&#xD;
[and The fancy store keeper, in opposition to the&#xD;
~entleman from Virginia, had such a hatred to the&#xD;
practice that he has been known to commit as-&#xD;
saults and batteries upon different persons who had&#xD;
presented themselves to his counter and asked for&#xD;
chicken gaffs, or gaffes, as others call them.&#xD;
Knowing this peculiarity of the store-keeper,&#xD;
Horsley sent a drayman to him with an order on&#xD;
him for a package of them, arid then watched&#xD;
from a hiding place the effect, thinking, (and here&#xD;
he was not as smart as usual,) that as he did not&#xD;
know the drayman, even by sight, that the dray-&#xD;
man did not know him. But when the enraged&#xD;
store wan asked the drayman who sent him for&#xD;
the article, that individual replied:&#xD;
"He didn't know his name, but that he had&#xD;
often seen him in Mr. ~orsley~s ~&#xD;
"Was he a boy?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, a slim chance of a stripling.'&#xD;
"Leave. sir," exclaimed the store-keeper.&#xD;
The drayman left in double quick time, and the&#xD;
store man, putting his hat on his head and hold-&#xD;
ing the order tightly in his fist, as though it was&#xD;
a bank note of great value, proceeded instantly to&#xD;
old Mr. Horsicy's store.&#xD;
The "old Ross" saw him go, and smelling a&#xD;
* rat, he followed at a respectful distance, to see&#xD;
where he was wending, and taking a spying posi-&#xD;
tion at the window, he saw him enter and show&#xD;
the note to his father, and he heard his father say:&#xD;
"I am afraid, neighbor, it is my son's hand&#xD;
write. I fear he is a wild youth."&#xD;
"I have no doubt of it, neighbor, and you know&#xD;
what the wisest man of the world has said about&#xD;
sparing the rod. Good morning, neighbor."&#xD;
The "old floss" further related that he saw his&#xD;
father show the note to a deacon, present. He&#xD;
dodged as the anti-gaff man left, and sat himself&#xD;
down to rumination. He knew that he must niect&#xD;
the responsibility some time or other, so he thought&#xD;
he would meet it then, and in he went.&#xD;
His father produced the order. LIe denied it.&#xD;
The old gentleman went to the desk with the note&#xD;

FATHERS FEELiNGS TOWARDS HIS SON-REFLECTIONS&#xD;
UI'®N Mv AUT~BIO5RAFHY.&#xD;
Through all this liveliness in ~he tone of Horsley&#xD;
there was an evident bitterness. His father had&#xD;
always treated him with undue severity, for a&#xD;
harmless wit and drollery, which, it always struck&#xD;
me, resembled much the gentle Elm's idiosyncra-&#xD;
ems. Horsley had something of the look of Lamb&#xD;
in his features, but there was much more energy&#xD;
and force in his character, yet his jokes were often&#xD;
so strange and upon subjects which it seems almost&#xD;
forbidden to treat with levity. Being brought up&#xD;
in his father's book store, and kept under m'~ch re-&#xD;
straint there, and having a great fondness for read-&#xD;
ing, he was t~elebrated for his vast knowledge&#xD;
among the intelligent customers of his father's es-&#xD;
tablishment. Gentlemen who called in the store&#xD;
for a particular book, have often been keown to in-&#xD;
&#xD;
quire his opinion of it, and they would often refer&#xD;
to him as to where they could obtain a particular&#xD;
quotation. All this should have made his father&#xD;
&#xD;
31&#xD;
&#xD;
not only proud~ of him but extremely indulgent.&#xD;
ALnd though he may have been proud of him, yet he&#xD;
could not understand the original vein of mirth and&#xD;
strange remark which would startle the old man's&#xD;
notions of propriety. florsley, poor fellow, lost his&#xD;
mother at a very early age. He had only a slight&#xD;
remembrance of herand I have seenhim, with Cow-&#xD;
per's poems, on his knees, reading the poet's lines&#xD;
upon his ~ picture, while the tears rolled&#xD;
down his cheeks. He was a youth of true cour-&#xD;
age, but when the idea of some wild prank crossed&#xD;
his mind, it seemed that he could no more resist&#xD;
the playing it than could the starving man resist&#xD;
the taking of food if it were within his reach. It&#xD;
was believed that his father, with his rigid notions&#xD;
of things, could never get over a certain awful act&#xD;
on the part of his son, perpetrated one Sunday in&#xD;
the church, and that was no less a matter than the&#xD;
taking of a pinch of snuff from the box of an old&#xD;
clerk in the book store, who always came to church&#xD;
with old Mr. Horsley. and who always kept his&#xD;
snuff cox on the seat beside him, to keep himself&#xD;
awake; but the clerk falling asleep, the lad quietly&#xD;
applied the snuff to the sleeper's nose, which sud&#xD;
denly awakened him, and what was strange, with&#xD;
a fit of sneezing, which startled the whole congre-&#xD;
gation with its loudness and frequency. Many&#xD;
had observed the old clerk asleep, and as such a&#xD;
thing was not known in the memory of the oldest&#xD;
pew-holder, it had excited much attention; the con-&#xD;
sequence was that the confusion of the congrega-&#xD;
tion was complete.&#xD;
Deep was the love between the old clerk, Mr.&#xD;
Beazely, and the boy. The clerk understood his&#xD;
character, and loved him as a fond parent loves an&#xD;
only, sickly and gifted child. The old clerk took&#xD;
the child as his bed fellow after his mother's death,&#xD;
and absolutely nursed him with a woman's tender-&#xD;
ness. He used to take him into the book store&#xD;
with him, and show him pictures to amuse him,&#xD;
and every body who entered the book storo might&#xD;
see the old clerk, with the sickly boy in his arms,&#xD;
waiting on the customers. He had acquired such&#xD;
a habit of carrying the child on his left arm, and&#xD;
waiting on the customers with the right, that he&#xD;
could do anything necessary about the store just as&#xD;
well with the boy on his arm as without. And then&#xD;

ly that one was tempted sometimes to think so.&#xD;
At times Horsley was the gayest of the gay, but&#xD;
in its very midst, if anything called up the name&#xD;
of Beazely, he was all gloom for hours. Then he&#xD;
had moods of abstraction, interrupted by the strang-&#xD;
est pranks and contradictions. In fact, many per-&#xD;
sons thought him partially deranged.&#xD;

While my good aunt thought I was preparing for&#xD;
college, I was deep in private theatricals. Until&#xD;
Hanson, my tutor in elocution, left-to be sure 1&#xD;
'vas then but a mere buy-I refrained, or rather&#xD;
was restrained, from going to the theatre more than&#xD;
two or three times by his influence, for he could be&#xD;
so little of a moralist as to half break a poor girl's&#xD;
heart, and that without any result to himself but&#xD;
the gratification of his vanity, while he could be s~&#xD;
&#xD;
my aunt's permission lie had takemi me to the thea-&#xD;
tre three times, and without her permission or&#xD;
knowledge, after he left, I had gone a great many&#xD;
times more. I practiced much diplomacy with my&#xD;
aunt to get the needful upon such occasiOns, and I&#xD;
believe if' the old lady had not given it to me, that&#xD;
I would have stolen it from her-from no one else&#xD;
but from her; and as I felt myself to be her heir, 1&#xD;
should not have thought it theft to take that which&#xD;
in course of time would naturally be mine. It is,&#xD;
however, with such sophistries that crime always&#xD;
begins.&#xD;
The very first performance I ever witnessed was&#xD;
Brutus, the part of Brutus by Thomas A.'Coopcr.&#xD;
1 shall never forget it. Hanson took me. Three&#xD;
times the day it was agreed upon that I should go,&#xD;
I passed and repassed the Holliday street thei~tre,&#xD;
with a kind of glee and chuckle to myself at the&#xD;
idea, as I looked on its walls. "Ha, old boy! (how&#xD;
we personify everything,), you shall have glori-&#xD;
ous secrets from me no more." It was almost the&#xD;
feeling of the half angry lover who gazes upon the&#xD;
coquette who has at last named an early day.. It&#xD;
was something of Richard's, "I'll have her;"&#xD;
the "I'll not keep her long," I can't say I added&#xD;
in my imagination, for certainly I considered the&#xD;
histrionic art the art of arts, and myself gifted that&#xD;
way. Alice Clare had invited me to a little party&#xD;
that night, but I forgot Alice Clare and her party&#xD;
too. It was the theatre,&#xD;
"The play's the thing."&#xD;
I was as cager as Hamlet, but with a diffeicut&#xD;
impulse. I remember how inattentively I walk-&#xD;
ed that evening in 1-loward's woods by Alice's&#xD;
side. I mean how inattentively to her, and won-'&#xD;
dered if the sun would nevbr set. After school,&#xD;
of an afternoon, it was much the custom for oor&#xD;
school girls and others to stroll through those woods&#xD;
with some of us boys with them-arid there I was&#xD;
strolling with Alice and forgetting her presence.&#xD;
"Alice, I am going to the theatre to-night; I&#xD;
wish you were going."&#xD;
"Why I thought you were coming to my par-&#xD;
ty?" she said, in an offended ton".&#xD;
"I know, I know, I want to go, Alice, hut then&#xD;
~ want to see Cooper's Brutus."&#xD;

"I trust so, Alice, and as you think I can beat&#xD;

someof the sex.&#xD;
I remember well how eagerly I clung to Han-&#xD;
son's arm as we entered amid a crowd, for there&#xD;
was always a rush to see Cooper in those days.&#xD;
We had taken front seats, and I was no sooner&#xD;
seated than looking round the theatre I caught a&#xD;

I thought. as I glanced at the stage, which Hanson&#xD;

should play at my first appearance. If it were&#xD;
now or within a few months, I thought I might&#xD;
play young Norval--&#xD;
"My name is Norval,"&#xD;
no, I have outgrown him. Let me see, I said to&#xD;
myself, I shall be nearly six feet high, a well&#xD;
developed chest, neck well set upon my should-&#xD;
ers-but the curtain ros~ and I forgot everything.&#xD;
When Cooper entered the applause was great, and&#xD;
[did certainly think him the "noblest Roman of&#xD;
them all."&#xD;
hat a gilded memory I still have of that&#xD;
I consider Cooper one of the handsomest men I&#xD;
t~ver saw. ! may say the handsomest, though I&#xD;
think "Tiger Tail," the Indian, in some points&#xD;
his equal. ! got Brutus, which I hold to be an&#xD;
admirable play, the very next day, and went de-&#xD;
claiming its beautiful passages everywhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
After Air. Cooper's engagement was concluded,&#xD;
Liooth was immediately to appear, and I was hoard-&#xD;
ing my pocket money with Horsicy to see that&#xD;
great but eccentric actor. 1 was told that Booth,&#xD;
the morning of the evening in which he was to ap-&#xD;
pear in Richard, could be seen in the market place,&#xD;
selling his turnips, the produce of his farm near&#xD;
Bel Air, and ! remember that Horsley and 1 got&#xD;
up early and repaired to the market house to see&#xD;
him, but we could not get him pointed out to us.&#xD;
We went at night, Horsley and I. I was up to&#xD;
trap, having been, and Horsley was determined to&#xD;
go on my representation. He could command&#xD;
more pocket money than I could, owing to the&#xD;
unlimited indulgence of Mr. Beazely, who, Ishould&#xD;
have mentioned, left him his fortune, which was&#xD;
upwards of twenty-two thousand dollars, the pa-&#xD;
tient savings of fifty years as salesman in different&#xD;
bookstores, but mostly, as our readers are aware,&#xD;
in Horsley's father's, for in no other capacity than&#xD;
as salesman in a book store had he ever acted&#xD;
The pit was seventy five cents, boxes one dollar&#xD;
We were so far advanced toward manhood that the&#xD;
announcement, children half price, did not apply to&#xD;
us, though we would, in theatrical phrase, for that&#xD;
night only, willingly have consented that it should.&#xD;
We made the suggestion to the box keeper, chil-&#xD;
dren half price.&#xD;
"If your anxious mothers don't know you're&#xD;
our," said the crusty, but humorous old box keeper,&#xD;
taking what survey he could of us through the&#xD;
pigeon hole, for we presented ourselves before him&#xD;
half an hour before he had any other customer,&#xD;
"you had better go home, piy children."&#xD;
"But as 'yOu are all actors here, cannot we ap-&#xD;
pear as children for this night only?" inquired Hors-&#xD;
ley in his peculiar way.&#xD;
"No, you can disappear s children though,~~ re&#xD;
pJied he of the box office.&#xD;
So my lame duck of a fifty cents being eked out&#xD;
by twenty-five from Horsley's more abundant purse,&#xD;
we purchased our tickets, and sat down with them&#xD;
in our clasped hands by the pit door, against which&#xD;
we pressed every two minutes to test the strength&#xD;
of the door and know whether it was not open&#xD;
yet. Soon it was opened, and we descended into&#xD;
the pit in its emptiness. Here we debated with&#xD;
ourselves which were the best seats, and we&#xD;
~1&#xD;
&#xD;
changed them until the increasing crowd left no&#xD;
choice, and we kept our position by necessity.&#xD;
"Now is the winter of our discontent,"&#xD;
certainly it was the evening of my absolute content.&#xD;
As characteristic I could not but smile at Horsicy,&#xD;
who certainly saw everything ridiculous about the&#xD;
play, and he was nt~t. unobservant of its beauties,&#xD;
but who, when a most miserable apology of an ac-&#xD;
tor announced:&#xD;
"My lord, the Duke of Buckiugham is taken,"&#xD;
exclaimed, loud enorjgh for half the house to hear&#xD;
him,&#xD;
"I wish you had been taken, too."&#xD;
This created a shout of laughter in the pit, and&#xD;
made Horsley almost as much the observed of the,&#xD;
observers, as the proud representative of Shak-&#xD;
speare's heroes himself.&#xD;
But all this is of a date of earlier life than that&#xD;
period at which I Qpened this chapter by saying,&#xD;
while my good aunt thought I was preparing for&#xD;
college, I was preparing for private theatricals.&#xD;
Among the greatest events in a boy's life, at least&#xD;
to himself, are his changes front school to school,&#xD;
which like the passions he developes, are each of a&#xD;
higher and more permanent cast than the other,&#xD;
until he finds himself launched on the stream of&#xD;
manhood to act for himself. Some of us, however,&#xD;
are permitted t~ act for ourselves before we reach&#xD;
the port and stature of a man, and it not unfre-&#xD;
(luently proves sadly to our sorrow that we are-&#xD;
"Lord~ of ourselves, that heritage of wo."&#xD;
Yes, at the Pavilion theatre, vulgarly called the&#xD;
mud theatre, in consequence of its location in the&#xD;
meadows, there was a Thespian corps, of which I&#xD;
was the star, the "particular" if not the "bright&#xD;
star."&#xD;
We were making every preparation to brink out&#xD;
Byron~s Sardanapalus, at my suggestion, adapted to&#xD;
the stage also by myself, and of course I was to be&#xD;
the king. The great difficulty wasab )ut the femal&#xD;
characters. For though in England, up to Charles&#xD;
II. time, the female personations in the regular&#xD;
drama were bearded men, yet matters did not get&#xD;
on half so well aS when the bearded men were ex-&#xD;
cluded from playing women. 1 was about to say&#xD;
they might still appear in the parts of old women~&#xD;
but I will not.&#xD;
&#xD;
At once the happy suggestion came from one of&#xD;
our number that probably Miss '~aria Watson,&#xD;
who had detached herself from the company when&#xD;
it left Washington, might be induced to play&#xD;
Myrrha for a small remuneration, as she was poor,&#xD;
and indeed it was hinted it would be a charity;&#xD;
and that her mother could easily be obtained to&#xD;
play the queen, it was also suggested.&#xD;
"But what kind of a looking personage is Miss&#xD;
Watson'?" I asked, though I knew very well, as I&#xD;
had secretly prompted the matter.&#xD;
"A cap-i-tal per-son," exclaimed my informer,&#xD;
who was himself an humble member of the same&#xD;
corps, whom we had gotten to speak to Miss Maira&#xD;
on the subject-&#xD;
This grave matter was the fruitful theme of&#xD;
three evenings' debate, and I believe that those of&#xD;
us who were in favor of having the sex legitimate&#xD;
ly represented would have been out voted had I&#xD;
not got Horslcy to make one of his droll speeches&#xD;
upon the subject. The fear on the part of the anti-&#xD;
Watsons was that our female acquaintances would&#xD;
not come if we had actresses.&#xD;
"Let them go then," exclaimed Horsley; "don't&#xD;
they go to the regular drama and witness females&#xD;
sustaining female characters? for my part, I've no&#xD;
desire to shave my beard-I have a beard, gentle-&#xD;
men-so close that it will never be heard of again,&#xD;
and make my appearance as&#xD;
"My own lonian Myrrha,"&#xD;
There is a good deal of endearment between the&#xD;
king and his Greek slave, which, to say the truth,&#xD;
I would rather not enact, for instance:&#xD;
"the breath&#xD;
Of friends for truth, the lips of woman for&#xD;
My only guerdon-so they are my Myrrha's.&#xD;
Kiss me."&#xD;
Those who have oot looked into Byron will find,&#xD;
should they do so, that the noble poet here states&#xD;
in so many explicit words, "he kisses her"-so&#xD;
states the stage direction, and I suppose," he con-&#xD;
tinned, turning to me, "my friend means to com-&#xD;
~ily 'with the stage directions."&#xD;
I bowed.&#xD;
"I presume, so it is to be presumed, that the fair.&#xD;
actress whoiu we propose having to honor us in&#xD;
this part on 'this interesting occasion, expects to&#xD;
comply with the stage directions also. I should&#xD;

contemplate, is not unlikely to imitate in more&#xD;

much awakened his and your emulation-those&#xD;
proud representatives of Shakspeare's heroes ~vho&#xD;
were very much in the habit of taking something&#xD;
to take-Cooke and Kean for instance, to say&#xD;
nothing of living worthies; and besides, I would&#xD;
suggest that he has also something to take on the&#xD;
part of the kingly Sardanapalus."&#xD;
It was voted to request Miss Watson to aid us&#xD;
on the occasion, and fifty dollars was also voted&#xD;
out of the general fund of the society to pay her,&#xD;
and myself and Horsley were appointed a commit-&#xD;
tee of two to confer with Miss Maria Watson in&#xD;
the premises.&#xD;

wflAT IIORSLEY SAYS OF TIlE STUDY OF MEDICINE AND&#xD;
LA~v,4c.-ADvI3Es ME TO TURN PLANTa'R-ARRIYE&#xD;
AT MISS WATSON'S.&#xD;
I urged Horsley that night to meet me in the&#xD;
morning, that we might together Call U~Ofl Miss&#xD;
Watson and arrange matters, but it was not until&#xD;
the next day that I got him started.&#xD;
"Bjll," said he to me as we walked down Mar-&#xD;
ket street, (it was then called Market street but&#xD;
now Baltimore street,) what profession do you mean&#xD;
&#xD;
BIOGRAPHY OF&#xD;
&#xD;
to choose-law or medicine-or do you mean to he&#xD;
a gentleman at large?"&#xD;
"Well, what do you?" said I.&#xD;
"Th tt's Yankee, but I'll answer you; I don't&#xD;
know-I have a great attachment to books, and I&#xD;
also feel sometimesstirrings to mingle in the strife&#xD;
of the world. I rather presume, as I have a little&#xD;
competency, that I shall follow my whims, and in&#xD;
consequence make myself a very miserable fellow.&#xD;
What are you going to do? whim, it too-you are&#xD;
tolziming it now."&#xD;
"Really, you have me there-I thought of the&#xD;
law, but you see, Florsley, what an uphill work it&#xD;
is; there is a drag on the wheel even in its ascent,&#xD;
.-dook at the fellows we know-Johnson, Josephs,&#xD;
Wilminson, they do not earn their salt-absolutely&#xD;
do not earn their salt-yet! have some advantages&#xD;
for the law; I suppose my oratorical talent would&#xD;
aid me."&#xD;
"Yes, in frothy Fourth of July declamations-&#xD;
'shine out, fair sun,' just one little day and clouds&#xD;
and darkness would be upon the rest of your year."&#xD;
"Why so?" I asked, yet I felt myself blush.&#xD;
"Why so? because so it will be. Now, Russell, I&#xD;
don't suppose you have any idea of turning doctor,&#xD;
the most abhorrent profession to me in the world.&#xD;
I reverence that man who undertakes it as a phi-&#xD;
lanthropist-I despise him who undertakes it for a&#xD;
livelihood, or rather I respect him just as much and&#xD;
no more, as I do the butcher who takes up a re-&#xD;
voltixig but necessary trade to live by it. But I&#xD;
repeat, the man who does it that he may do good&#xD;
has my profoundest homage. I take it you are not&#xD;
that man."&#xD;
"Thank you, Horsley."&#xD;
"For nothing. I am speaking seriously. If&#xD;
you 'read law,' as the phrase is, the law will be&#xD;
unread, while you will be 'reading the lore of&#xD;
ladies' eyes,' as Tom Moore or some other Tom&#xD;
says. You will just be among the host of idlers&#xD;
who dawdle their time away about the court house,&#xD;
and make reading law an excuse for idleness,&#xD;
which. they would dignify by seeming to be some-&#xD;
thing. You'll be of those whose name is legion.&#xD;
who may be seen around th~ bar whispering the&#xD;
last scandal, fitting themselves to be in the bar,&#xD;
talking of the last party or horse race, or pretty&#xD;
actress-I have you there-or maybe wading ankle&#xD;
&#xD;
WILLIAM RUSSELL.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
deep into the great ocean of politics by acting as 1 "In contradistinction to a loafer! Well, you&#xD;
secretary of a ward meeting, held to consider the don't certainly mean to say that you mean to be a&#xD;
&#xD;
condition of the country, and so flinging away yqur&#xD;
existence upon follies and frivolities."&#xD;
"Why, what the deuce would you have me&#xD;
do?" I exclaimed.&#xD;
"I would not have you of such as I have describ-&#xD;
ed. If you 'read law,' you surely will be, unless&#xD;
you are born again-I do not meaii to speak ir-&#xD;
reverently-of the spirit of the law. You have tal-&#xD;
ents, quick perceptions, and a great deal of muscu-&#xD;
lar energy. You are of the temperament of actors&#xD;
and orators, 1 will admit, but you have strong&#xD;
passions which you have not learned to curb, and&#xD;
I am afraid you have a good many wild oats to sow,&#xD;
and if I could not break the stick as I choose, I&#xD;
would wear it gracefully and not give it to another&#xD;
to break my head with."&#xD;
"What are you driving at?"&#xD;
"Well, not exactly what you are driving at-&#xD;
an actress and private theatricals. I am thinking&#xD;
of your position on the public stage among real ac-&#xD;
~ where we have no kings. Here, were you to&#xD;
attempt to play the part of a republican, a private&#xD;
Sardanapalus, you would meet the fate of the king-&#xD;
ly one. whose part you have yourself adapted to&#xD;
the stage, and who himself, talking of the life&#xD;
which he has led, speaks also of affording an ex-&#xD;
ample of warning to others, to&#xD;
"avoidthe life&#xD;
Which led to such a consummation."&#xD;
"Really, Horslcy, you have turned moralist."&#xD;
"Not a bit of it. I see your character-I am&#xD;
your friend-and I would, to use a phrase natu-&#xD;
rally arising in my mind, from our present mat-&#xD;
ters in hand, I would have you place yourself pro-&#xD;
perly and gracefully on the stage before the curtain&#xD;
&#xD;
moralist, a christian, and imitate&#xD;
&#xD;
'The first true gentleman that ever lived,'&#xD;
as one of the poets has beautifully said of the Sa-&#xD;
viour?"&#xD;
"Why no, I expect not that," said I, somewhat.&#xD;
annoyed, for there was an earnest, searching man-&#xD;
ner about Horsley, which I could neither dodge&#xD;
nor laugh at.&#xD;
"There, here we are at a stand ~ said he,&#xD;
stopping in the street.&#xD;
"Stand still! why, man, we are going to see Miss&#xD;
Watson."&#xD;
"Yes, so we are, but you're not fitting yourself&#xD;
for college. I have been observing you some time,&#xD;
Russell-you are not fitting yourself for college-&#xD;
you are unfitting yourself for college and fitting&#xD;
yourself for anything else."&#xD;
"What would you have me do, I repeat'?"&#xD;
"There's the rub, I repeat. 'Tis decided you&#xD;
will not be a physician."&#xD;
"Certainly nut," I exclaimed.&#xD;
"You ~ be a lawyer?~~&#xD;
"That's not so certain," I replied, "I certainly&#xD;
had notions that way, but say out your say, speak&#xD;
the speech, I pray you, not as I pronounced it to&#xD;
you of the law, but just as it would occur to you&#xD;
of your own advisement, like old Polonius to&#xD;
Laertes."&#xD;
"Well, well, I never was more serious, 1~us-&#xD;
sell. We fellows are leading very foolish lives&#xD;
lately, and I've been thinking of it. Do you&#xD;
know you drank five juleps last night, and did not&#xD;
get to bed until three this morning?"&#xD;
"I know it, but at the present writing I feel&#xD;
&#xD;
'rises."                                       like silk."&#xD;
"Well, you have not told me what part to place  "Silk, you'll feel wor8ted before long-but blasl&#xD;

"Not until we have played out the play," I ex-&#xD;
claimed.&#xD;
"Well, agreed. But as I was saying about&#xD;
your choosing a profe~sion-you have talent and&#xD;
all that enough, but your love of the sex, your&#xD;
high animal spirits, and your want of patient ap-&#xD;
plication, would prevent your applying yourself so&#xD;
as to give you any other than a nominal position at&#xD;
the bar. I tell you why I say all this. Old&#xD;
Gorum, the lawyer, was in the store the other&#xD;
day when you were, you remember. When you&#xD;
went out he spoke of you; he said you were a man&#xD;
of talent, that he was pleased with your conversa-&#xD;

be of the mob of young briefless barristers who live&#xD;
at ease about the bar upon what money they have,&#xD;
and do nothing hut set a bad example to the poorer&#xD;

"Why, call yourself a farmer, live gracefully on&#xD;
your farm, and then you may do just as you&#xD;
choose; or you may call your farm a plantation, the&#xD;
estate which you will inherit will be large enough&#xD;
for such a cognomen, and then you can call yourself&#xD;
a planter; but to prevent being taken up under the&#xD;
vagrant act, you had better have some ostensible&#xD;
mode of livelihood. Then as it pleases you, you&#xD;
can cultivate pigs or politics, poultry or poetry, and&#xD;
you will be under your own vine and fig tree, and&#xD;
there will be no one to make you ~&#xD;

with the idea, "but here is the house of my 'own&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
MISS WATSON A t HOME-HER APARTMENTS-wE DIscuss&#xD;
HER BEFORE SHE ENTERS-HER APPEARANCE-SHE&#xD;
CONSENTS TO APPEAR AS MYREHA-wE STUDY OUR&#xD;
PARTS TOGETHER-SCENES BETWEEN US-HER AlERT-&#xD;
TION-SEE MAKES ME FORGET OTHER PEOPLE.&#xD;
It was in Old Town, just over Market street&#xD;
bridge, that we found the abiding place of Miss&#xD;
Watson. A little black girl, who seemed to be&#xD;
what the New Englanders would call the "help"&#xD;
of the family, opened the door, and ushered us&#xD;
into a parlor, very plain, and with nothing notice.&#xD;
able about it. She announced to us that Miss Wat-&#xD;
Sun was in, and would be down presently. Miss&#xD;
Watson had been very much the admiration of&#xD;
our club for her performance in light comedy, and&#xD;
some of her characters in farces were admirable, but&#xD;
she had never found place yet in the higher walks&#xD;
of the drama, and the quere was, could she per-&#xD;
sonate such a character as Myrrha? I, who was&#xD;
anxious for the eclat of appearing with a real ac-&#xD;
tress, and Horsley, who seemed always, except&#xD;
when he had some wild prank in his head, to think&#xD;
of the fitness of things, and who seemed to yield&#xD;
to my humors that he might control me in higher&#xD;
matters, as I have suspected since, was decidedly&#xD;
for having her undertake the part if she felt dis-&#xD;
posed to do so.&#xD;
Miss ~ personations in the lighter drama&#xD;
had impressed me very favorably. There was an&#xD;
airy grace and naivete in her manner, which was&#xD;
very taking, and in those graver parts which came&#xD;
up, even in the lightest representations, there was&#xD;
an impresiveness and pathos which it seemed to me&#xD;
only wanted opportunities of development to cx-&#xD;
hibit tragic talent of a very high order. At least&#xD;
such was ray impression, and I had thought overt&#xD;
such mattOrs a great deal. There also was a&#xD;
strength of expression in her countenance, which'&#xD;
had been frequently remarked upon, and an energy~&#xD;
in her look and hearing that seemed to promise~&#xD;
something not yet fulfilled. This struck me-.-but~&#xD;
the young lady was still only the queen of cham-~&#xD;
her maids in comedies and the dashing second rater&#xD;
line of characters of farces.&#xD;
"~hc is keeping us waiting for an histrionic dis-&#xD;
plny in her toilet, I suspect," whispered Horsley&#xD;
&#xD;
'C&#xD;
suppose she will enter gew-gawed to death&#xD;
and dressed within onc mortal half inch of her life.'~&#xD;
But be had scarcely spoken when the doox&#xD;
opened, and Miss Watson made quite a dignified&#xD;
and at the same time easy entrance. She was&#xD;
dressed in a calico wrapper, of a plain and dark&#xD;
pattern, with a simple linen collar turned over and&#xD;
I confined with an ordinary broach, and I observed&#xD;
she wore quite a stout shoe, though it fit exquisite-&#xD;
ly, and the foot was very small, with a springing&#xD;
and high instep; her mouth was rather large, but&#xD;
she had beautiful teeth, and her chiseled nostril&#xD;
moved with every breath, which gave a look of&#xD;
passion to her face. Her brow was broad, not&#xD;
high, and the tern pies were accurately defined.&#xD;
with that look of genius about them of which Cole-&#xD;
ridge speaks-at least I thought so, for she was to&#xD;
play Myrrha to my Sardanapalus.&#xD;
"1 have made no toilet, because," said she, "I&#xD;
would not keep you waiting," and she requested&#xD;
us to be seated.&#xD;
I left llorsley to talk over the matter of our&#xD;
visit, the while my admiring eye was full upon&#xD;
the attracttve actress.&#xD;
CC I will be frank with you3 gentlemen,~~ she&#xD;
said, catching back her curls with the tortoise&#xD;
shell comb, such as were worn in those days, and&#xD;
speaking evidently without disguise, "I think my-&#xD;
self qualified to play such a part as Myrrha, though&#xD;
circumstances which I could not, of course, control,&#xD;
have kept me in a different line of characters. I&#xD;
am anxious to show that I can enact higher char-&#xD;
acters. Vou, I believe, Mr. Russell, play Sar-&#xD;
danapalus."&#xD;
"With you for a Myrrha I shall try-at least I&#xD;
may serve as a foil to you.~~&#xD;
"I have often heard, Mr. Russell, of your taste&#xD;
for the drama, and of your skill in reading-have&#xD;
you ever played before?"&#xD;
"Never-this is my first atteral)t."&#xD;
"Do you think you can stand unnerved the au-&#xD;
dience, the array of lights, the music, the excite-&#xD;
ment?"&#xD;
"I am inclined to think so," I replied-"are you&#xD;
a physiognornisr-don't you think so?"&#xD;
"Well. I'm not a physiognornist, and there is&#xD;
no telling; the subsequently most suceessfui have&#xD;
failed at first"&#xD;
'3&#xD;
&#xD;
41&#xD;
&#xD;
"True," I said, "but we do not sell any tickets&#xD;
-we give them away to our friends, and there&#xD;
will be none hut friends there-so I hope to sus-&#xD;
tain myself."&#xD;
"Oh! there's no doubt about your sustaining&#xD;
yourself; as far as knowing his part and repeating&#xD;
it goes, I assure you, Miss Watson, he will be&#xD;
there. Eever since he was knee high to his aunt's&#xD;
footstool he has declaimed to the delight of every-&#xD;
body and to the especial delight of the declaimer-&#xD;
the experience of Dick, the apprentice, is nothing&#xD;
to Ilussell's-all I fear is that nothing mal-apropos&#xD;
~rill happen to cure him of his stage mania. I&#xD;
charge you, on your conscience, do nothing to in.&#xD;
flame it, Miss W~~5~n?~&#xD;
"On my conscience," replied the lady, "and I&#xD;
assure you, I know no amateur actor with whom I&#xD;
would so soon appear as with Mr. Russell-I have&#xD;
heard of his readings, and in fact I have heard him&#xD;
read."&#xD;
"No matter-I'll tell you some other time," re-&#xD;
torted the lady archly, "but I have little doubt of&#xD;
Mr. Russell's success if his nerve hold out-&#xD;
and"-&#xD;
"Speak out," I said.                -&#xD;
"We only understood the stage effect. I feel,&#xD;
gentlemen, great solicitude in this matter~, for this&#xD;
reason, that should I make a hit as Myrrha, why&#xD;
the town will talk about it-that very portion&#xD;
which you represent, and who are the patrons of&#xD;
the drama; and I shall then have ~n opportunity of&#xD;
placing myself in proper position with the manager,&#xD;
therefore I am doubly anxious that everything&#xD;
should go off well. With you, Mr. Russell," she&#xD;
said, turning to me, "the affair is the eclat of a&#xD;
night, and your want of success would be nothing,&#xD;
for should you greatly succeed, you might be told,&#xD;
what Chesterfield-was it no ?-said to the gen-&#xD;
tlema' who danced remarkably well, that he&#xD;
danced too well ror a gentleman- so you may act&#xD;
too well-I mean in tee player's l)art-for a gen-&#xD;
tleman. With me it is different; I play profession-&#xD;
ally, and cannot play too ~vell for anl actress."&#xD;
"We have one of your corps who will assist in&#xD;
all matters whereof we are ignorant,~7 I remarked.&#xD;
"Yes," said the fair actress, "you must let me&#xD;
see the play as you have adapted it, Mr. Russell.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
THE' AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF&#xD;
&#xD;
Do Crafts, (the man who was assisting us) has&#xD;
told me' that lie thought very highly of it. You&#xD;
must let me see it; I should like to read it with&#xD;
you several ~&#xD;
"It will give me great 'pleasure. Really, if in&#xD;
our little corps you should make a' hit in a new&#xD;
line of acting, and so high a 'one, we shall deserve&#xD;
a place in theatrical history."&#xD;
The fair actress blushed; Ipromised to call on&#xD;
the morrow with the play. and we took our leave&#xD;
with the understanding that she was to appear in&#xD;
the part.&#xD;
To the forgetfulness of everything I studied my&#xD;
part with the fair actress. Morning, noon' and&#xD;
night was I strolling over into Old Town. I re-&#xD;
member now how I used to take a by street that I&#xD;
might rehearse my part a little tQ myself as I went&#xD;
along. And then the 'perfectly at home manner of&#xD;
the actress. She dwelt in a small two story house&#xD;
in Front street, which was very plainly furnished,&#xD;
and in which, as I have said before, there was&#xD;
nothing that marked the professional life of the&#xD;
indweller. The little black girl, who caine to the&#xD;
door, was their only servant, and ~liss Watson in-&#xD;
formed me that herself and mother painted'maps&#xD;
for the booksellers, or even took in sewing when&#xD;
not professionally engaged. She had been twice&#xD;
on a professional tour, but she did not like it, and&#xD;
she said she was not sorry when the present man-&#xD;
aglr had left without engaging them. Her mother&#xD;
was not at all remarkable as an actress, and just&#xD;
maintained the footing of always being letter per-&#xD;
feet in her part, and of performing it respectably..&#xD;
"If you will stay and dine, I will give you a&#xD;
mutton chop and a potatoes " she would say, "and&#xD;
you'll excuse me if I set the table in your presence&#xD;
you can watch me and see if I don't do it well.&#xD;
Did you never observe that we theatrical people&#xD;
always have the manner of persons looked at; that&#xD;
is, we always sit with a grace, a consciousness,&#xD;
and stand with a consciousness, and live, and move&#xD;
an(l have our being with a consciousness-there,"&#xD;
said she, bowing to me one evening when I was&#xD;
staying to tea, "and did I not, 0! kingly Sardana-&#xD;
piles, put that plate down with a grace?"&#xD;
"You did, my own lonian Myrrha. By the&#xD;
bye, look here, Miss Myrrha, Byron says here, in his&#xD;
dramatic persoute: 'Myrrha, an lonian female slave&#xD;
&#xD;
and the favorite of Sarditnapalds.' Thereby hang8&#xD;
the wish tha~t Sardanapalus might be your favor-&#xD;
he-one good turn deserves another."&#xD;
"So you are my fayorit~, do 1 not love you-do&#xD;
'I not say my 'la~t' thought is yo.nr's7 do I not&#xD;
*die fQr you--ia the play?"&#xD;
"But will you live, for me here?"&#xD;
"Come, King Sardanapalus, keep your love-&#xD;
making for the boards," said she, slightly blushing,&#xD;
"or carry it to the ears that should, properly listen&#xD;
to it."&#xD;
"Here, mon amje," she would say, "when you&#xD;
embrace me at that passage where yo~i tell me I&#xD;
embrace you:&#xD;
"Myrrba, embrace me; yet oace more, eace more!&#xD;
Love we whate'er'betide: My chiefest glory&#xD;
~halI be to maice me worthier of thy love-"&#xD;
"Please put your'arm just so--and. I will so&#xD;
manage it that the ladies,' your dear friends, can&#xD;
not know whether there is any kissing or not. I&#xD;
foresee I shall get' you into trouble. I kiss profes-&#xD;
sionally.-. never at rehearsals, never-but on the&#xD;
stage, and there I have about as much feeling in the&#xD;
matter as Napoleoii's sister, Pauline, had, when&#xD;
she sat to Coiiova, and that was none at all, for the&#xD;
room was 'well aired.' lh fact, my feeling', is&#xD;
generally that of supreme disgust, to be breathed&#xD;
upon by the gin-blasted breath ot some poor drunken&#xD;
wretch, who is playing Paul to my Peggy ~n&#xD;
some farce or other. I assure you, my goid sir,&#xD;
'us no farce to me. So even the quakers would&#xD;
pardon me as' they pardoned a 'Friend' who was&#xD;
caught kissing a simple sister, inasmuch a~ I 'kiss&#xD;
without an appetite.'"&#xD;
Sometimes Miss Watson' and I ~vould take a&#xD;
ride away into ihq country, andY wandering deep&#xD;
into the woods, we would rehearse our parts to-&#xD;
gether. She read beautifully, and how I delighted&#xD;
to lay my full length along at her feet and listen&#xD;
to the music of her voice. I believed myself a&#xD;
good reader, and she flattered me into the convie-&#xD;
tiofl that I was one, so I often took the book and&#xD;
w~td to her, arid we would talk together with soeb&#xD;
a warm sympathy, of poetry, literature, a~oing;&#xD;
an(l the passioris'too, we would discuss, and that&#xD;
of lpve was often in our rIa~egory.&#xD;
Miss Watson was certainly the announcer of&#xD;
hold opinions irt the matter 4~ the passions; hut he~&#xD;
&#xD;
WILLIAM RU$SZLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
conduct seemed above rejroach, and I observed,&#xD;
in all her freedom of intercourse with me, no one&#xD;
seemed 'disposed' to scandalize her. I saw'in her a&#xD;
deep ambition, the deepest to become distinguished,&#xD;
as she felt convinced she bud the power to distin-&#xD;
guish.herself. We were full 'a month in prepara-&#xD;
tion for our play, and I observed that her enthusia-&#xD;
ism 'never abated for a moment. I was; though I&#xD;
saw her daily, frequently in the reception of notes&#xD;
from her about some matter pertaining to t~ae play,&#xD;
whitib she had forgotten in our last interview, ~nd&#xD;
though we. had again and again rehearsed ~ur parts&#xD;
together, she never seemed to tire of it, and I&#xD;
could not but think that she was about to make a&#xD;
decided hit. I felt my own courage mount, and&#xD;
the conviction came to me ~h'at I was not ~o fail,&#xD;
whenever we rehearsed together.&#xD;
'She seemed to like me veiy much. She always&#xD;
ran up tome with so much joy in her countenance&#xD;
whenever I met her at rehearsal, y't she would&#xD;
say to me when we had been, for instance, rehaars-&#xD;
ing at night:&#xD;
"No,' you, shall nOt go home with me-'~is a&#xD;
~terrible walk to Old Town-De Crafts can attend&#xD;
tee-call upon that beauty, that perfect beauty,&#xD;
Miss Clal c~[ do admire her so md'ch. Good night!&#xD;
Do not forget to-morrow. 0! King, and that you&#xD;
have an appointment with Myrrha,~~ and away&#xD;
she would hurry, leaning on the arm of this Mr.&#xD;
Do Crafts, as complete a puppy of a player as ever&#xD;
audience bore with, or as ever bored an audience.&#xD;
How it did annoy and pique me, and then [would&#xD;
stay aw'ay a day or two in spite of our rehearsals.&#xD;
"Oh, y m truant," she would 'exclaim, when&#xD;
:~he 'again saw me, "where have you been? gallant-&#xD;
ing the 'ladies and utterly forgetful of your 'own&#xD;
lonian Myrrha' 'and yot~r kingly duties-more-&#xD;
your theatrical oties-i sh~n't forgive, you-I shall"&#xD;
I positively quarrel with you if youtreat me so again.&#xD;
0&#xD;
Ho~v I hai(e missed you! no one to read to me, to&#xD;
talk to me about my glorious profession, for glorious&#xD;
it is, with all its tinsel and vagahoudism, full of&#xD;
glorious names too. No one to keep my spirits up&#xD;
about my new part, which is ot so much coose-&#xD;
qoence to me-your pastime. my earnest, my&#xD;
reality. 0! how I have oisSC(l you!" cumi that&#xD;
face of hers, which could express so fuocti,&#xD;
would exprcs'~ so much, and with a kind of magoe~&#xD;
&#xD;
43&#xD;
&#xD;
~tism thrilling through me f'roni her tones and pres-&#xD;
ence, and bewitching eye, I would take a seat be-&#xD;

CHARACTER 01' MYRRRA-THE LAST 5CENE~-THE CUR.&#xD;
TAIN FALLS-HER EMOTION-THE CONDUCT OF MRS~&#xD;
CROMPTON.&#xD;
One, day, it was in the early fall, and the beau'&#xD;
ful trees of our Americanforest were just taking&#xD;
'the tinge of the change which was coming upon&#xD;
theni, when Miss Watson and myself rode out into&#xD;
the country to enjoy the delicious weather and&#xD;
each other's society alone, and to rehearse together&#xD;
our parts.&#xD;
I left my horses and vehicle in charge of the boy&#xD;
who had driven us, and I proposed to her that we&#xD;
should take a stroll to a very romantic pldee called&#xD;
Oak Glen, about 'a mile and a half above Baltzell's&#xD;
blacksmith shop. She had often heard me speak&#xD;
of the glen~ aud was anxious to visit it. Accordin~r-&#xD;
ingly arm in arm we wended our way thither in the&#xD;
pleasante~t kind of chat-now repeating a' passage&#xD;
of poetry, now talking of some point made by some&#xD;
distiu~uished actress or actor, now discussing the&#xD;
different re'adiugs of Shakspeare, and now'givin~'&#xD;
our own readings of the l)assioiIs as to how they&#xD;
exhibited' themselves, and on my part, at least,&#xD;
mixing a~ little of the reality with the discussion.&#xD;
Our purpose wac to view ilie glen and not to enter&#xD;
it; so by an easy pathway we wound round a hill,&#xD;
an(l came to a point 'where a broad sheet of water&#xD;
was (ompreSsC(l between two hills,~ou~ of which~&#xD;
the one on which we stood, was quite flat on top,&#xD;
with a precipitous tetininatiolt at the point wher&amp;amp;&#xD;
the stream passed through. Here, undei' an old oak&#xD;
called the Deer oak, from the fact that it was a&#xD;
Spot from which mauy deer had been killed, when&#xD;
thty were ku )wri in the neighborhood, we took a&#xD;
seat ~nd gazed in silence over t~'ie beautiful glen~&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC8021-00000021"/>&#xD;
44                         THF~ AUTOBI&#xD;
with the thread of silver water gleaming through'&#xD;
it. Only at this point could the glen be dis-&#xD;
tinctly seen, for at all others the oaks and un-&#xD;
derwood were so thick around as entirely to inter-&#xD;
cept the view. Here we sat, entirely secluded as&#xD;
it were from the world, at the foot of' the old oak,&#xD;
to which, I may observe, a path wound up more&#xD;
abruptly than the other, on the side of the hill&#xD;
by which we had ascended.&#xD;
After dwelling on the beauties of the scenery&#xD;
around us, I drew my MS of my adaptation of Sar-&#xD;
danapalus to the stage from my pocket, and began to&#xD;
read it. Almost unconsciously Miss Watson rose&#xD;
to her feet, and we rehearsed the most difficult&#xD;
scenes as they occurred to us. In the midst of our&#xD;
employment, who should come suddenly upon us&#xD;
but Booth and Martha Jones.&#xD;
I laughingly explainedeto them what we were&#xD;
doing, and made Booth promise that if I sent him&#xD;
tickets he would come and bring Martha with&#xD;
him, and I introduced them to Miss Watson.&#xD;
Martha had never been to a theatre, and Booth&#xD;
said that he would take her with' pleasure. Booth&#xD;
was a man of ability, but poor, and with hard&#xD;
scratching he was managing to live while he&#xD;
read law. There had been a great intimacy be-&#xD;
tween him and Martha ever since the affair at&#xD;
Lusby~s school, when Booth prevented her being&#xD;
punished by knocking down the teacher. Booth's&#xD;
position in life was an humble one, and I used to&#xD;
think at times there was a dogged discontent about&#xD;
him that made him very disagreeable.&#xD;
"I shall be so glad to go to the performance,~~ I&#xD;
said Martha, "1 have never been to a theatre, I&#xD;
and I know nothing of them, except that I have I&#xD;
heard you read and recite, and. talk of such things." C&#xD;
"Yes, Martha, you were among my first encour-&#xD;
agers, and 1 shall never forget it. I believe you&#xD;
were the very first. It is tho§e who first notice&#xD;
us, is it not," said I, turning to tli'e actress, "whom t'&#xD;
we longest remember, rather than those who chime' C&#xD;
in, be it ever so loudly, with the general voice?" d&#xD;
"I think so," she replied. "I shall never forget I~&#xD;
the encouragement which old Burke, our prompter, 1~&#xD;
t~ave me at my first rehearsal, when fright had xi&#xD;
made me utterly forgetful of ray part. Lie told me p&#xD;
to take courage, for he had observed that those who ut&#xD;
were panic-struck at first, often made the best tt&#xD;
&#xD;
OGRAPHY OF&#xD;
actors, r~nd that sensitiv~uess was a proof of arty&#xD;
thing but want of ability. Well, ['ye sensitiveness&#xD;
enough. Would you believe it, as the time ap-&#xD;
proaches, I shrink fearfully from attempting the&#xD;
character of Myrrha-one so much out of my'&#xD;
line."&#xD;
"You think I'm honest, don't you?" I asked.&#xD;
"Well, I do, except where women are concern-&#xD;
ed, as Addison would say."&#xD;
"Where you are concerned, in all respects hon-&#xD;
est. You have given me credit for some judgment&#xD;
and taste, in theatrical matters. I tell you, you&#xD;
will succeed-observe, all the parts will be respect.&#xD;
tably maintained. We have been rehearsing now&#xD;
for six weeks, by daylight and by candlelight, so&#xD;
every one knows his part. Remember, we have&#xD;
been rehearsing before a whole pit full of friends-&#xD;
'twas like an audience-'twas an audience. I do&#xD;
not think any one Will be panic stricken, and if you&#xD;
just let yourself out, abandon yourself to your feel-&#xD;
ings, you'll make a hit, I feel convinced. Don't&#xD;
fear any fright on my part. I have declaimed a&#xD;
great deal in public, and I know that with von as&#xD;
Myrrha I can acquit myself pretty well for me."&#xD;
~ curious, but' as the time approached I&#xD;
had to encourage the actress, but then she 'felt she&#xD;
had so much at stake.&#xD;
At length rlu~ important night arrived. The&#xD;
house was crowded by all the fashion and beauty,&#xD;
that could by any means obtain admission, and as&#xD;
ur tickets were given away to our friends, the&#xD;
hing was considered very select. Alice Clare ap-&#xD;
cared early in the stage box, attended by Mr.&#xD;
Peterson, who evidently had taken the greatest&#xD;
)ains with his toilet, and who evidently was taking&#xD;
very pains to make an impression. Booth was&#xD;
here, attending Martha Jones, and 1 was struck&#xD;
vith the expression of her subdued, earnest and&#xD;
beautiful countenance. There was Mrs. Cromp-&#xD;
on, the most aristocratic lady of the city, with a&#xD;
rowd of fitshionablen about her; she was a lady of&#xD;
decided poetical talent, and as heaotuful as Mrs.&#xD;
~orton, who has so much. I had submitted ray&#xD;
IS of ~\'~y adaptation of th~ play to her, and had&#xD;
~on h9r regard by following her advice in several&#xD;
particulars. There were a good many there who&#xD;
tmetosnfteratanyratE~, and a good many who came&#xD;
applaud at any rate, I 'lori't think I ever saw a&#xD;
&#xD;
WILLIAM RUSSEVL.&#xD;
&#xD;
more brilliant audience-every person in the house&#xD;
was well dressed, and held, at least, a respectable&#xD;
situation in society.&#xD;
I may say all the characters were well sustain-&#xD;
ed. Tom Johnstone, who played Salemenes, ac-&#xD;
quitted himself with great credit; he exhibited&#xD;
decided histrionic talent. I observed that Mr.&#xD;
Peterson was loud in his applause of him, partic-&#xD;
ularly in the scenes between Salemenes and Sar-&#xD;
danapalus-but I do not feel disposed to mention&#xD;
any particular one, except Miss Watson. I had&#xD;
gone after her myself, previous to dressing, and&#xD;
brought her dressed to the theatre; she looked the&#xD;
character admirably. But I was astonished at her&#xD;
nervousness. She put her hand in mine as we&#xD;
rode together to the theatre, and I remarked to&#xD;
myself its strange coldness, and that she never&#xD;
said a word.&#xD;
"My dear friend," said I, "what is the mat-&#xD;
ter?"&#xD;
"Oh!" said she, clasping my hand, "I have so&#xD;
panted to have an opportunity like this, to appear in&#xD;
a first rate part in tragedy, and here now that it is&#xD;
offered me under such happy auspices why should&#xD;
I feel so dreadful? this is just as bad as a first ap-&#xD;
pearance.~~&#xD;
"The house was nearly full before I ca~e~you~ll&#xD;
have a brilliant audience. [ will do my best to&#xD;
sustain you. I think we'll-you'll coitie it-indeed&#xD;
I do-and then if you exhibit the talent I know&#xD;
you possess, your fortune ts made-for we'll make~&#xD;
you the fashion."&#xD;
According to my adaptation, Sardanapalus enters&#xD;
in soliloquy, and is soon followed by My rrha. I say&#xD;
nothing of my greeting, but Miss Watson's was&#xD;
enthusiastic, and she looked the character so well,&#xD;
and bowed so gracefully to her greeting' that it was&#xD;
renewed again and again. The first scene, which&#xD;
is not very striking, Miss Watson got through&#xD;
well. It began to be whispered about the house,&#xD;
as she with dignity claimed to retire, saying:&#xD;
"My sovereigfi,&#xD;
I prdy, and thou too, good prince, permit my absence,"&#xD;
that she was better in tragedy than comedy. But&#xD;
in the second scene hsr powers expanded, she be-&#xD;
gan to feel the fruition of her gifts. This passage&#xD;
drew down thunders of applause:&#xD;
&#xD;
45&#xD;
&#xD;
MYlUIHA.&#xD;
"Frown not upon use; you have smiled&#xD;
Too often on me not to make those frowns&#xD;
Bitterer to hear than any punishment&#xD;
Which they may augur. R'in~, 1 am your subject!&#xD;
Master, Jam your slave-Man, I have loved you-&#xD;
Loved you I know not by what fatal weakness,&#xD;
Although a Greek, and born a foe to monarchs-&#xD;
A slave and hating fetters-an Innian,&#xD;
Aad therefore when I love a stranger, more&#xD;
Degraded by that passion than by chains!&#xD;
Still I have loved you. If that love was strong&#xD;
Enough to overcome alt former nature,&#xD;
Shall it not claim the privilege to serve you?"&#xD;
The parts I have italicised were given with the&#xD;
highest effect; you could have heard the rustling of&#xD;
Mrs. Crompton's lilac satin. The following pas-&#xD;
sage was beautifully uttered. 0! her tones were so&#xD;
full of Woman's true tenWerness, and her eye filled&#xD;
and floated in a pearly tear, which, as she conclud-&#xD;
ed the sentence, stole out upon her cheek and&#xD;
glittered there a diamond of the purest water:&#xD;
MYRRUA.&#xD;
"The very first&#xD;
Of human lire must spring from woman's breast,&#xD;
Your first small ~vords are taught ~eu from her lips,&#xD;
Your first tears quenched by her, and your lastsighs&#xD;
Foe often breathed out in a woman's hearing;&#xD;
When men have shrunk from the ignoble care&#xD;
Of watching the last hour of him who led them,"&#xD;
When Sardanapalus replies to this:&#xD;
My eloquent Joatan! thou speakest music,'~&#xD;
the whole house thundered with applause.&#xD;
And further on, where the King refuses to yield&#xD;
to the entreaties of his warriors, and determines&#xD;
to go forth to the banquet-&#xD;
IIIYRRHA.&#xD;
~sen thou wilt not yield,&#xD;
Even for the sake of all that ever stirred&#xD;
A monarch into action, to forego&#xD;
A trifling revel"&#xD;
SAROANArALUS.&#xD;
"No."&#xD;
AL~ RRItA.&#xD;
"Then yieldfor mine,&#xD;
For ray sake."&#xD;
This last line was uttered with such deep ten-&#xD;
(lerness ;hat no one wondered that the King yield-&#xD;
e(l for her sake. I know as I stood beside her,&#xD;
her tones thrilled to my very soul, and I verily&#xD;
believe the great credit I got for my acting was&#xD;
inspired by the magnetism of hers. The soliloquy&#xD;
of My rrha, which closes the first act, was given&#xD;
with great effect, and as the curtain "ent down&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC8021-00000022"/>&#xD;
we met in the green-room.&#xD;
"How have I done?" said she, in a tremulou:&#xD;
whisper, as she grasped my hand.&#xD;
~sGreatly,~~ I replied. "Fanny Kemble conk&#xD;
not equality, she has not your tones of tenderness.'&#xD;
She folded her arms upon her heart, and i'aic&#xD;
nothing,, but the quick breathing 6f her fram&#xD;
showed how much she felt.&#xD;
In the 2d act' Myrrha has nothing to do, except&#xD;
in the closing scehe, which she, gave with in-&#xD;
creased effect.&#xD;
In the 3d act, where she tells Sardanapalus to&#xD;
"Go forth and conquer,"&#xD;
and where, When left alone, after soliloquizing, she&#xD;
draws forth the vial of "cunning Colchian poison,"&#xD;
she was great. The "go forth and conquer" was&#xD;
uttered in tones which pealed through the whole&#xD;
house, and the audience fairly shouted their ap-&#xD;
probation.&#xD;
Where she tells Pania to go forth to the battle&#xD;
and to leave her, ~he was very powerful. This&#xD;
passage at her exit was very effective:&#xD;
"Nay then Iwill UO forth,&#xD;
A feeble f~mate 'n~idst thezr desperate strife,&#xD;
And bid thee guard ~ne tkqre-where thou shouldst shield&#xD;
Thy sovereign."    .          -.&#xD;
In the closing scene of this act (3d) where she as-&#xD;
sists Sardanapalus, who is wounded, off tIje stage,&#xD;
her tones of -tenderness were again' most taking.&#xD;
Her simple "pray lean on. me," touched all&#xD;
hearts.&#xD;
"I am making some of those fair gi4s jeal-&#xD;
ous,'~ she said to n~e -as w&amp;amp; teach ed th~ ~reerI&#xD;
room. 'What a gorgeous beauty that Miss Clare&#xD;
is-how she. watches us-she is in love with-you."&#xD;
"ha, do you think so-rather with the gentle-&#xD;
*     man who is with her in the box."            -&#xD;
"No, with you-'she feels so much, that she has&#xD;
ceased to plk~r him off on you. I (hin't wonder,&#xD;
indeed, 'you d~ look wall 'to tight. You are a&#xD;
very Sardanapalus in yotir nature, I fear."&#xD;
In act 4th, Myrrha~s manner in listening to the&#xD;
drearri of Sardanlipalos was anithir emsuuitOte&#xD;
i~i~'~e of acting. The ~hitting expre~simn of lt~r&#xD;
face was marvellom-.-.it was observed that the :~u~&#xD;
&#xD;
46                            THE AUT4&#xD;
the p~it rose in respect to her, and thundered thei&#xD;
approbation.&#xD;
I was struck with Miss Watson's manner whei&#xD;
&#xD;
WILLIAM RUSSELL.&#xD;
&#xD;
BIOGRAPHYY OF&#xD;
r dience rather looked at her to trace the effect of&#xD;
the dream on her than listened to Sardanapajus.&#xD;
ri Her mother as Zarina played with great spirit,&#xD;
owing no doubt to her daughter's success.&#xD;
s In the last act, where Myrrha fires the pile,&#xD;
she rose to the full sublimity of the tragic Muse.&#xD;
I Her farewell to lonia, which, with the aid of Mrs.&#xD;
Crompton, I had made longer than it is in the or&#xD;
I iginal, was uttered with an effect that drew tears&#xD;
from every eye. And her last words, ere she&#xD;
mounts the blazing pile: -&#xD;
- "'Tis fired, 1 come,"&#xD;
were spoken in such a phrenzy of devotion, yet&#xD;
so caIrn withal, that when the ~urIain fell, the&#xD;
whole house, ladies and all, rose, and called for&#xD;
her again and again. -&#xD;
"You must go out," I said to her.&#xD;
"But what can I say-I cannot speak my gra-&#xD;
titude," and she shook in every fibre.&#xD;
'You must bow in acknowledgment at least-&#xD;
crime my dear, my dearest friend," and I led her&#xD;
forth.&#xD;
Thunders of applause greeted her appearance,&#xD;
and then there was the deepest silence, while&#xD;
every person stood up. The fair actress looked&#xD;
round the house, as if she would. meet the eye of&#xD;
every person in it, and I was impressed with what&#xD;
I thought to .be her calmness, when laying her&#xD;
hand upon her heart, she burst into tears..&#xD;
In a silence born of profound resliect, I led Miss&#xD;
Watson off the stage, and as soon as the Stage&#xD;
door closed upon us again, the theatre rc~echoed&#xD;
with deafening applaitse.&#xD;
While I was exchanging my kingly robes for&#xD;
republican ones-of Plain black, Horslcy, who, out&#xD;
of respect to his father, wotdd not take any part,&#xD;
though he would have shone in otte, came to itte&#xD;
with a message from Mrs. Grompton, saying site&#xD;
would be glad to see me in her box.&#xD;
"Wait for me a moment, Fitusley, and I'll go&#xD;
with you. What did you think of Miss Watson?"&#xD;
"Think of her! great, magnificent. Russell,&#xD;
our 'Ihespian COt~5 will have a place in history."&#xD;
"That's ins', what I have told her, und she&#xD;
bears it SO W(-lI.~&#xD;
"B~antifnlly," said hlorsley, with enthusiasm,&#xD;
''hcaiitifnlly."    -&#xD;
&#xD;
47&#xD;
&#xD;
In a moment more, leaning on llorsl~y~s arm, I&#xD;
presented myself to Mrs. Crompton.&#xD;
"'Who is Miss 'Watson, Mr. Russell?'&#xD;
I told her.'&#xD;
"Ab, and has she to -paint maps and take in&#xD;
sewing for a living?"&#xD;
"She has, Madam, I have it from her own&#xD;
lips."&#xD;
"Mrs. Crompton looked at me with a searching&#xD;
eye.&#xD;
"Mi. Russell, is her character unimpeached?"&#xD;
"It is, Madam, on my honor, as far as I know,&#xD;
unimpeachable. I believe, Madam, the elevation&#xD;
of her character is equal to the greatness of her&#xD;
genius."&#xD;
"Do you think she has disrobed herself."&#xD;
"Yes, Madam, I left her in a plain black silk,&#xD;
in the green-room."&#xD;
"Can we easily get there?"&#xD;
"Easily, Madam."&#xD;
"I will take your arm, then, and call upon her&#xD;
and pay my respects to her. She is a brilliant&#xD;
creature. I never witnessed better acting, and I&#xD;
have seen muuh of it abroad as well a.~ at home."&#xD;
So saying, Mrs. Crompton took my arm, and&#xD;
making way for her through the crowd, we entered&#xD;
at the side door, and passed across the stage, the&#xD;
curtain being down, into the green-room. We&#xD;
foiind her surrounded by a crowd of adoring Thes-&#xD;
pians, attired in a plain black silk, her best and&#xD;
only dress gown in fact. I presented Mrs. Cromp-&#xD;
ton to her, and her manner, if possible, was better&#xD;
to the lady than it had been on the stage.&#xD;
"My dear." said Mrs. Crompton, "I cannot&#xD;
tell you how delighted I am-how delighted we&#xD;
all are. I have been partial to the theatre, and I&#xD;
have seen much acting. I never saw better; we&#xD;
have a jewel of therarest excellence in our midst,&#xD;
and knew it not until to-night. You seem tired?"&#xD;
"Thank you. 0! thank you for your kind&#xD;
words; yes, rather tied, Mrs. Crompton."&#xD;
"Come, take a seat in the box with me, my (lear&#xD;

could do such things with a grace equal to any&#xD;
one I ever saw, took Miss Watson's hand and&#xD;
placing her arm in her own, led the trem-&#xD;
bling actress to her box. It had been whispered&#xD;
through the whole house that Mrs. Crompton,&#xD;
the first lady of our city, had gone into the green-&#xD;
room to compliment Miss Watson, and when that&#xD;
lady appeared, leading her in, and ~gave her the&#xD;
front seat in her box and took a seat beside her,&#xD;
the whole house uncovered themselves in silent&#xD;
respect, and . ose until they were both seated..&#xD;

WiTH MISS IyATSON-WHAT SHE SAYS- HER&#xD;
ADVICE TO ME.&#xD;
"Where's your mother," I whispered to Miss&#xD;
Watson.&#xD;
"Mother has gone home to get a little supper&#xD;
for you and, me," she replied, "when all this is&#xD;
ove;"&#xD;
Just at this moment the hell rang. I looked in&#xD;
wonder at the stage, knowing that the farce, which&#xD;
was 'Raising the Wind," could not come on so&#xD;
soon, as Jim Jumper had to dress far the principal&#xD;
female character, and he had not begun when I&#xD;
left the dressing room, when lo! who should make&#xD;
his appearance l)elore the foot lights but Horsley&#xD;
himself, in his plain citizen's dress; he was very&#xD;
popular with everybody, and so he was loudly ap-&#xD;
j)laude(l before they knew what he had to say.&#xD;
"Ladies and gentlemen," said he, with that&#xD;
naivete and attractiveness of manner for which he&#xD;
was remarkable, "I have the great gratification to&#xD;
inhirm you that the tragedy of Sardanapalns will&#xD;
he repeated on Thursday evening next, for the&#xD;
~eco~'l and last time. The bill presented will be&#xD;

"V.&#xD;
'ED&#xD;
TIU~ AU TUb&#xD;
We are of opinion that the true way to acknow-&#xD;
ledge genius is to reward it."&#xD;
Thunders of applause greeted this announ~ie-&#xD;
ment; I felt a little nervous at the idea of&#xD;
playing for money, and I wondered that such an&#xD;
arrangement shotild be made without consulting me.&#xD;
In a few moments I withdrew from Mrs. Cromp-&#xD;
ton's box, and entered Mr. Peterson's, who did n~t&#xD;
wear the merriest f~tce in the world, and who kept&#xD;
his seat close by Miss Clare. I bowed. Mr.&#xD;
Peterson uttered some inane compliment to my&#xD;
Sardanapalus, and grew loud in the praise of Tom&#xD;
Johastone's Salemenes, but I grew louder and over&#xD;
topped him, and told him that Tom was greater in&#xD;
farce, if possible, than in tragedy. "Garrick,"&#xD;
said I, "was painted between comedy and tragedy,&#xD;
with an inclination towards the comic muse, to&#xD;
show the tendency of his genius, and so our friend&#xD;
Johnstone might be painted. Though I don't&#xD;
know, perhaps his tragic powers are the gicater&#xD;
after all, and then ,the character of Salemenes is&#xD;
the most difficult in the play."&#xD;
Mr. Peterson was silent.&#xD;
"Well," said Alice, "I have been reading&#xD;
Sardanapalus repeatedly since you have had it in&#xD;
rehearsal. It is.a beautiful play. What made you&#xD;
select such a character?-it is a very odious one."&#xD;
"I don't think so."&#xD;
"Don't think so," echoed Alice, "what do you&#xD;
think of his treatment to his wife-it's almost a5&#xD;
bad as Napoleon's treatment of Josephine. To&#xD;
think of a woman, and a wife too, flinging her love&#xD;
away on such a man."&#xD;
"Why; Miss Glare, that is a harsh censure."&#xD;
"It is just, Mr. Russell. I hope you don't jus-&#xD;
tify Sardanapalus, do you?"&#xD;
"I think he could not but love ~lyrrha, and we&#xD;
must think of the times in which he lived."&#xD;
"Well, who is Miss Watson?"&#xD;
"Alice, does she not play magnificently,.is she&#xD;
not superb?"&#xD;
"Yes, she plays beautifully, but I wonder a deli-&#xD;
cate woman can play such a part!"&#xD;
"Why not, Alice, you don't object to the King,&#xD;
do you, to your humble servant, King Sardanapa-&#xD;
Ins," said I, laughing.&#xD;
"Say Miss Glare, if you please. Mr. Russell-I&#xD;
object to the playing," said Alice, haughtily.&#xD;
&#xD;
[OGRAPUY QF&#xD;
&#xD;
I could not but observe the grim satisfaction&#xD;
which here sat upon Mr. Peterson's features.&#xD;
"A proper sentiment, Miss Glare," he remarked.&#xD;
"You don't object to the player, i~hough, Alice&#xD;
-Miss Glare-do you?"&#xD;
"I certainly do object to the player's playing&#xD;
such a parr-such sentiments."&#xD;
"My own Jonian Myrrha,~~~I exclaimed-&#xD;
"Alice, it was reality, it was no playing.".&#xD;
"Well, sir, there is your "own lonian ~yrrha~~&#xD;
opposite, with Mrs. Crompton, who, I suppose,&#xD;
means to make a lioness of her. I advise you to&#xD;
take the reality to her, sir. I hope you'll meet&#xD;
with a return."&#xD;
"Thank you, Miss Glare, to obey your com-&#xD;
mand is but to follow my inclination," and bowing&#xD;
haughtily I withdrew.&#xD;
I entered the box where Martha Jones was seat-&#xD;
ed with Booth, feeling that I ought to speak to&#xD;
her, and yet shrinking at the idea that I might be&#xD;
thought fishing for compliments.&#xD;
"Martha, I trust you are well to-night--good&#xD;
evening, Mr. Booth." The gentleman bowed and&#xD;
offered me. a seat, but I declined it.&#xD;
"0! well,. I thank you, Mr. Russell, and so&#xD;
much gratified. I want you to promise me one&#xD;
thing."&#xD;
"What's that, you shall have it."&#xD;
"That ribbon which you wore with thoso flow-&#xD;
ers round your head. I have a fancy for them."&#xD;
"Certainly, you pay me a great compliment.&#xD;
I will go and get it now." And before she could&#xD;
prevent me I departed.&#xD;
In the grecit room I found Horsicy discussing his&#xD;
announcement of the second performance with a&#xD;
number of the Thespians.&#xD;
"Fellows, I did it myself," said he, "because I&#xD;
could not call you together. I gain no cuba by it~&#xD;
I do not appear. but this lady is poor-what a&#xD;
magnificent actress she is!--. and this move will give&#xD;
her a thousand dollars-come, I'll ensure iL. No,&#xD;
some of you'might have objected to playing for the&#xD;
money; here's Russell, lie's just secli an individ-&#xD;
ual-tltough he'd play for idls vanity-old boy you&#xD;
played grenily; if it had nut been for the astounding&#xD;
hit of Miss VVatson you'd have been the talk. But,&#xD;
fellows, the bill is out, and you can't bncl out. I&#xD;

a kind one towards Miss Watson, whom [scarcely&#xD;
know. I expect to get a thundering lecture as it is&#xD;
from the old gentleman. Some 'dear, good natur&#xD;
ed friend' will tell him, I don't doubt, that I&#xD;
made my appearance too, but he won't tell how or&#xD;
why."&#xD;
I hastened with my ribbon and flowers to&#xD;
Martha Jonas, who ~eeeived them with SO much&#xD;
real pleasure.&#xD;
"Now," said she, "the next time you come to&#xD;
see me I want you to read the play to me-will&#xD;
you not? I thought MissWatsort had a fine eye&#xD;
and face when you introduced me to her under the&#xD;
deer oak, but I had no idea that she could make me&#xD;
feel as I have felt to-night-my, my, but she is so&#xD;
gifted."&#xD;
"Yes," said Booth, "and she has been playing&#xD;
here for this year past in lhrces and not exhibiting&#xD;
any particular ~&#xD;
"Foote made his first appearance in Othello,"&#xD;
said I, "and he made a failure of course. And I&#xD;
believe Matthews thought his forte was tragedy.&#xD;
Unless we strike the vein of ore we work the mine&#xD;
in vain."&#xD;
Here I saw Miss Watson beckoning to mc, and I&#xD;
hastened to her side.&#xD;
"Indeed I feel so worn out," she whispered to&#xD;
me "I should like to go home; so many persons&#xD;
have been here to say pretty things to me, that 1&#xD;
am quite exhausted. I exerted myself so&#xD;
"I whispered to Mrs. Crompton her condition,&#xD;
and she told me to use her carriage and escort her&#xD;
home.&#xD;
"Adieu, Miss Watson," she said, in her kindest&#xD;
tone, "we shall soc you at your benefit-every one&#xD;
now will appreciate your genius."&#xD;
Scarcely a word did either of us speak as we&#xD;
Tolled in Mrs. Crompton's stately carriage to the&#xD;
humble house of my fair companion, whither I&#xD;
had ordered, without her knowing it, a collation,&#xD;
that her mother might be spared the expense and&#xD;
trouble of getting one.&#xD;
Arrived there, Miss Watson walked to and fro&#xD;
two or, three times, and then, as if impelled by an&#xD;
impulse she cruld not resist, she threw herself ir.&#xD;
toy arms and exclaimed:&#xD;
"My more than lover, my true, disinterested&#xD;
&#xD;
if you had not whisper~1 so many words of ebeer-&#xD;
ing, I should have broken down at first and for-&#xD;
ever. Notv, now, I feel I ant5 pfe, 'tad I se~ a&#xD;
bright pathway before me. God forever bless you."&#xD;
I led her to the sofa, and seated upon it pbs&#xD;
rested her head upon my bosom, and I felt through&#xD;
the thin cambric her warm tears on my very heart,&#xD;
and I believe they awakened more than one ira-&#xD;
pulse there, dormant until then.&#xD;
Mrs. Watson's manner arrested my attention;&#xD;
she silently embraced her daughter when they met,&#xD;
and while she was arranging the table for our little&#xD;
feast of wine and birds, she could not take her eyes&#xD;
from her daughter, but seemed to look at her in a&#xD;
bewildered wonderment.&#xD;
I told Miss Watson of the scene between Alice&#xD;
and myself~&#xD;
"Beware, my friend," said she, with great&#xD;
seriousness, "if you love her, beware-.-a jealous&#xD;
and proud woman will do anything. She is jeal-&#xD;
ous of me, perhaps; J told you so. ~he will en-&#xD;
gage herself to that Mr. Peterson, or that Mr. Any-&#xD;
body else, and marry him before you are aware.&#xD;
The heart, somebody says, is easiest caught in the&#xD;
rebound."&#xD;

&#xD;
from Boston, who wished to he of Mrs. Crompton~s&#xD;

Mrs. Cromapton wrote a prologue 'at my request,&#xD;
and 'a very neat one it Was, and I spoke it~ It was&#xD;
:up'on the promise that I would speak it 'that she&#xD;
wrote it.' She said she 'knew that my memory&#xD;
would soon get it and 'easily retain it---which was&#xD;
a fact-and she was pleased to'sa~ that she would&#xD;
not trust it to anybody's elocution bat mine. It&#xD;
went off well, and, 'strange thing for a prologue,&#xD;
it was encored, but that was in honor of Mrs.&#xD;

dignity, that the whole house was ClLctrttied, arid I&#xD;
each person reeling the effect of it in his own heart,' I&#xD;
&#xD;
then all burst out into a shout of applause.&#xD;
As they become reconciled, Sardanapalus kisses&#xD;
her and says:&#xD;
"Kiss me-now let them take my r~a1m and life!&#xD;

Than all the most indebted-but a heart&#xD;
That loves without self love-'tis here-now prove it."&#xD;
There was a pathos in her tones that moved&#xD;
every heart. I glanced at Alice at the moment&#xD;
an4 caught her eye full upon mine., She was&#xD;
scarcely ten feet from me; there was something in&#xD;
its expression which 1 could not read-it seemed&#xD;
both cold and kind, reproachful and forgiving,&#xD;
Miss Watson noticed it to me after we left the&#xD;
stage, and said she thought Peterson was playing&#xD;
irte false in some wtiy or other.&#xD;
In the last act the curtain fell in a tempest of ap.&#xD;
please4 Miss Watson was called out, and I had&#xD;
the honor of presenting her to the audience. She&#xD;
had committed a, speech~ which I had prepared for&#xD;
he~r, but she could not utter it.&#xD;
"Spealc kir me, 0! speak for me," she said,&#xD;
"Ladies and gentle~en,~~ I remarked, "the lady&#xD;
who leans upon my arm has desired me to speak&#xD;
for bet. Though she had pri~meditated something&#xD;
to say in return jbr your kindness, she cannot give&#xD;
it utterance. 'There are thoughts that lie too&#xD;
deep for' words,' we are told, and so it is with her&#xD;
gratitude. She feels that this is the proudest hour&#xD;
of her existence, and she bids rue say that it shall&#xD;

worthy of your kindness to-night."&#xD;
As I was riiakin~, what I took to he a must dig- 4&#xD;
nithid exit, with Miss Watson on my aria, my par-&#xD;
ticnlar~ friend, James Jumper, Esq., who had rriade~&#xD;
himsolt' ttis~nanimously tipsy in honor of the occa-&#xD;
sion, arose in the pit and proposed "th~ee cheers&#xD;

were given 'apparently wrth great good will, but I'&#xD;

and return to make my host how, and I could&#xD;
have kicked Mr. .Jumper with all my heart,&#xD;
rtotwithstartditig lie looked at me as if be thought&#xD;
&#xD;
he was doing the very thing, as he stood swaying&#xD;
his body to and fro, leading the cheering.&#xD;
The U( notable Lorane Dudley, attached to the&#xD;
English embassy at Washington, and a gentleman&#xD;
of noble descent and heir to an earldom, who had&#xD;
seen the best actors of the age, and who was es-&#xD;
teemed a person of taste in theatricals, averred to&#xD;
me that he had never seen better 'acting on either&#xD;
the French or English stage. After the play' was&#xD;
over, I escorted Miss Watson to Mrs. Crompton's&#xD;
box, at that lady's request, and the whole house&#xD;
rose and uncovered as she entered. 'Mr. Dudley&#xD;
asked Mrs. (3rompton to present him to Miss Wat-&#xD;
son, and he advised her by all means to go abroad.&#xD;
tie said, and lie would endorse it, that she would&#xD;
succeed in Diury Lane, and he promised, if she&#xD;
would~ go, to give her such letters as would ensure&#xD;
her an appearance in whatever character she might&#xD;
select.&#xD;
Through the whole evening Miss Clare and I&#xD;
only spoke to each 6ther at ~ distance. I called on&#xD;
Martha Jones'and had a pleasant talk with her and&#xD;
others of my acquaintance. I observed how very&#xD;
attentive Mr. Peterson was to Alice the whole'&#xD;
evening; and whenever his thoughts wandered, as&#xD;
I thought they did sometirifes wander, I felt satis-,&#xD;
fled that he was thinking of starting a new Thes-&#xD;
pian society.&#xD;
"My friend," said Miss Watson to me that tiight&#xD;
as we were seated together in her happy home,&#xD;
"rn~ke up your mind in your love matters to act at&#xD;
once; remember what Sardanapalus nays:~&#xD;
"To what gujfs&#xD;
A single deviation from the track&#xD;
Of human duties leads e~ en those who claim&#xD;
The homage of mankind as their born due,&#xD;
And find it tilt they forfeit It themselves."&#xD;
The proceeds of Miss Watson's heueflt were just&#xD;
eighteen hundred and t~n dollars, The money, in&#xD;
gold, was put in a beautiful purse, and Mrs. Crorap-&#xD;
ton was s~ kind as to undertake the delicate duuty&#xD;
of presenting it to her, which she did, as Mt~s&#xD;
Watson told me, with all becoming graciousness.&#xD;
TJie press was loud in praise of Mise Watson's&#xD;
acting. 11cr Myrrha was pronounced oti all ha~ds&#xD;
one of t~e most pert'eet representation ever seen.&#xD;
Full of the e~citernent ol' success, arid the way-&#xD;
ward feeling arising from my misunderstanding&#xD;
with Alice, and the new impulses springing front&#xD;
&#xD;
514&#xD;
&#xD;
my intimacy with. Miss 'Watson, I attended a sup-&#xD;
per given by our Thespian corps in honor of our&#xD;
triumph. My brain was in a perfect, whirl. I&#xD;
was possessed with such a spirit of restlessness&#xD;
that I could not keep still a moment, and every&#xD;
body was askitug me what was the matter for days&#xD;
before our performance. The fact is, the excite~&#xD;
mont of the circumstances by which I was ~tur~'&#xD;
rounded was enough, without any extraneous ex~&#xD;
excitement3 to throw me out of the even:tenor of my&#xD;
way, had it ever been very even; but as it was,&#xD;
our late suppers, dinners, and deep drinking, threw&#xD;
me entirely off my balance, and the night of our&#xD;
Thespian supper, above mentioned, I was little bet-&#xD;
ter than one crazed. I was crazed, for I knew not&#xD;
what I did or where I was.&#xD;
Somebody says that the ~assiov~ for excitement is&#xD;
a six sense. We smell, taste, feel, hear, see, and then&#xD;

&#xD;
evanescent impression which the stone cast into&#xD;
the *ater makes, that widens and is lost ere you&#xD;
say there it is, my mind ran here and there over&#xD;
what I had done and what I had not done, until&#xD;
~ fancy and fact were test together, and there&#xD;
was scarcely a "fixed ~ in my memory. What&#xD;
a terrible sensation all this produced. I awoke&#xD;
about four o'clock in the morning and knew not&#xD;
where I was. I gazed wildly round the room and&#xD;
knew not of my locality. Presently a gentle foot-&#xD;
step came to my bedside, and I asked who is it'?&#xD;
where am I?&#xD;
A gentle voice replied~&#xD;
"'Tis I, Mr. Russell."~&#xD;
"And who is I?" I asked.&#xD;
"'I'is your friend, Maria ~&#xD;
"~y God! Maria, am I in your house?"&#xD;
"You are, 5j~*~~&#xD;
"How came I here?"&#xD;
"You came of you~'self, sir."&#xD;
"Came of myself! Did I offer you any un~&#xD;
civility?"&#xD;
"No, indeed-but you are unwell-can I do&#xD;
anything for you'?"&#xD;
"Maria, I have been dissipating so much lately&#xD;
...my nerves are perfectly unstrung-have I done&#xD;
anything uncivil-anything wrong?"&#xD;
"Indeed you have not, unless corning here be&#xD;
wrong. YOu came here about three o'clock yes-&#xD;
terday, and said you were very ill, said you did not&#xD;
know What was the matter with you; you have&#xD;
been subjected to too much excitement lately. I&#xD;
'. insisted upon it that you should rest yourself.&#xD;
I went over to the apothecary~s and got you an&#xD;
opiate, and here you are. I have been hitting by&#xD;
your bedside ever ~&#xD;
"My God, tell me what I have done?"&#xD;
"Nothing that I know of, but you must keep&#xD;
quiet."&#xD;
"Keep quiet, how wretched I ~&#xD;
"I do not wonder at it-you have been so much&#xD;
excited of late. My dear friend, what has come&#xD;
over you'?~~&#xD;
"I know not-I know not-who brought me&#xD;
here?"&#xD;
"You promised me to come-how strangely you&#xD;
acted-you came by yourself.~~&#xD;
"I have offered you no indignity, have I'?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"None, none-compose yourself"&#xD;
"Good God, I have had all sortsof'dreams. I know&#xD;
not what I have done, or what I have not done.&#xD;
God bless you, Maria-God forever bless you."&#xD;
"I trust God will, and you too.~~&#xD;
"I trust he will, though I do not deserve it-how&#xD;
wretched I am."&#xD;
"That you must expect-you have been to~&#xD;
much excited lately."&#xD;
"Well, well, give me some more of that opiate,&#xD;
and let me sleep awhile."&#xD;
And awhile I did sleep, but it was only a little&#xD;
while. I was soon awake and aroused to deeper&#xD;
agonies.&#xD;
"My dear Maria, but I ~m miserable, most mis-&#xD;
erable-don't leav~ ~&#xD;
"Mr. Russell, I do not mean to leave."&#xD;
"I am sorrowful and forlorn-I do not know why&#xD;
I should feel so."&#xD;
"Why, it is natural, you have been under s1'&#xD;
much excitement of late, and then your tempera-&#xD;
ment is naturally one prone to the wildest, the&#xD;
deepest excitement."&#xD;
"My best friend, I wonder if Alice Clare know&#xD;
it."                                       S&#xD;
"I cannot tell, I fear to~ many of your fiends&#xD;
know it. A day has worn away under this fitful&#xD;
and strange excitement of yours; several of your&#xD;
friends have called to ask how you were."&#xD;
"Did you let any of them see me. Wild, wild,.&#xD;
don't I repeat myself a great deal. My God, 'but&#xD;
I must have drank terribly~"&#xD;
"Indeed you have, I have sent for three bottles&#xD;
of brandy within these twenty-four hours, and you&#xD;
have drank every drop of them."&#xD;
"But how came I here?"&#xD;
"Oh King! I have told you, but you must ral1y~&#xD;
-come, you must be bright-you must be your-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
"Maria, I believe that fellow Peterson is head-&#xD;
ing me with Alice Clare.'&#xD;
"1 should not wonder-you know her father&#xD;
drinks too much. She must naturally have a re-&#xD;
pugnance to the vice of drinking."&#xD;
"Great Providence, but you did acquit yourself&#xD;
beautifully as Myrrha, indeed you did."&#xD;
"So they say, but why should you mar my er~&#xD;

"Why should fl-but my dear Maria don't&#xD;
leave me, I am so wretched."&#xD;
"I will not leave you, let me repeat to you;&#xD;
though my character should be at stake in keeping&#xD;
you here, I will not leave you."&#xD;
This stung me, and I said, arising, in the calm-&#xD;
est tone possible:&#xD;
"Oh! I forgot, I promised to meet old Hess-.--&#xD;
Horsley-among the Thespians to-night."&#xD;
"But you must not ~ she said, "you are not&#xD;

C&#xD;
I HASTEN TO THE POTOMAC-JOHN5TONE '5 QUAR-&#xD;
EEL WITH HIMSELF-HIGH WORDS BETWEEN&#xD;
JOHNSTONE AND uoltsLEy-IIoRSLEy's RESENT-&#xD;
MENT-THE RESULT.&#xD;
I hurried to the Potomac establishment, and who&#xD;
should I find there but Horsicy, Jim Jumper and&#xD;
Johnstone, as excited as I was, though certainly&#xD;
not possessed of such a spirit of wild and ungovern-&#xD;
able melancholy.&#xD;
They began instantly to joke me about the pret-&#xD;
ty actress. Taking it as no joke I indignantly re-&#xD;
p~lled their insinuations, which only made them-&#xD;
in their excited condition-worse. I told Horaley&#xD;
that I thought better of him.&#xD;
"Hang your picture," said he, "I thought better&#xD;
of you. Why, old fellow, you have been on the&#xD;
tallest kind of a spree."&#xD;
"My sprecing is my own look out," I replied.&#xD;
~ he rejoined, "but you had better&#xD;
look in, and ask yourself if you are doing right."&#xD;
"What are you doing?" I asked.&#xD;
"Doing-I am done f~'r-I am on a regular heat-&#xD;
The old man and I have had it hip and thigh. I&#xD;
have done myself the distinguished honor to quit&#xD;
the parental roof. The ol~l gentleman heard I had&#xD;
been on the stage, and without condescending to&#xD;
ask me any questions he broke upon me, and I&#xD;
~broke away from the lecture and the house to-&#xD;
g~ther.~~&#xD;
"Good !" exclaimed Jim Jumper, "I would&#xD;
~have done that long ago."&#xD;
&#xD;
RUSSELL.&#xD;
&#xD;
53&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes," retorted Horsley, "you would do any-&#xD;
thing that was lawless and rascally,~)&#xD;
"Thank you, old Hoss, I would but hdve been&#xD;
following your example," rejoined Jim Jumper.&#xD;
"Good!" was the cry around the board.&#xD;
"You'll follow any bad example set you," ex-&#xD;
claimed Horsley. "Good examples are to you like&#xD;
holy water to Satan; you shun them as soixiething&#xD;
that is not in your vocation."&#xD;
Tom Johostone, in his second representation of&#xD;
Salemenes, had not been as successful as at ljrst,&#xD;
and Mr. Tom was provoked threat. The fact&#xD;
was, that he had had a quarrel with himself upon&#xD;
the subject, the very worst person to quarrel with&#xD;
in the ~vorld, as the world always says that it is a&#xD;
just quarrel, and - that the individual is his owa&#xD;
worst enemy. Tom, to use the fashionable phrase&#xD;
of later days, had got "tight" on the occasion of&#xD;
the last representation, and several times he not&#xD;
only articulated his sentences with much thickness&#xD;
of utterance, but twice he forgot his part entirely,&#xD;
and the voice of Mr. Dc Crafts-the prompter..-.&#xD;
was heard all over the house, reminding Mr. Sale-&#xD;
ruenes, alias Mr. Tom Johnstone, of his forgotten&#xD;
part. How Tom hated it! for he had acquitted&#xD;
himself with much eclat upon the first represents..&#xD;
tion, and the consequence was, that he had been&#xD;
* drinking deep ever since the evening of Miss&#xD;
Watson's benefit, by way of drowning his humili-&#xD;
ation. Humiliation is a fish that can sometimes&#xD;
swim in very deep waters, and like the ghost of&#xD;
Banquo, will not down.&#xD;
"Damn you," exclaimed Johnstone to Horaley,&#xD;
"you talking of vocations; wh'~ gave you the au-&#xD;
thority to order a second perfurmatice of the play?~~&#xD;
"Authority! On my conscience, Salemenes, if I&#xD;
had known that you would have made such an awful&#xD;
failure in the part on its second representatiuu, I&#xD;
would almost have seen myself in Tophet-aye, in&#xD;
hell-before I would have suffered you to appear-&#xD;
you ure a disgraced man&#xD;
"You are a fool forever," retorted Johnston..&#xD;
"A fool forever--you're a born fool, sir, and&#xD;
therefore you are the one to whom the epithet&#xD;
should apply of a fool forever. Johnstone, you&#xD;
have no idea of what a granny you made of your.&#xD;
self in your last appearance. Why, man, you began&#xD;
tight, and you got tighter, and you concluded tight'&#xD;

stage directions, you 'draw out the weapon from&#xD;
the wound,' beat anything that I ever saw. You&#xD;
must have had the colic-you could not have act-&#xD;
ed it. How you twisted-I thought of having&#xD;
you painted, and putting you in the museum as the&#xD;
dying gladiator."&#xD;
"Dying gladiator! You are a dying fool."&#xD;
"Sir, you insult me-better, however, a live&#xD;
dog than dead lion. What a fool you would have&#xD;
been without me-nobody to keep you in counte-&#xD;
nance, 'alone in your glory.' "&#xD;
"Fool without you,~~ (how maudlin these fel-&#xD;
lows were,) "I am a fool with you, and two fools&#xD;
never made a wise man yet, did they?"&#xD;
"I don't know, suppose you and Russell try it."&#xD;
"No, you and ~&#xD;
"Thank you, sir, I am not so great a fool as you&#xD;
take me&#xD;
"Well, I did take you for the greatest fool I&#xD;
ever saw-1-the greatest-and if you have any thing&#xD;
to say why judgment should not be rendered in the&#xD;
premises, I pray you speak now or hold your peace&#xD;
forever more."&#xD;
"Hold my peace forever more; I have a great&#xD;
mind to kick you."&#xD;
"Kick mel Actions speak louder than words-&#xD;
suppose you try it. There's a christening to your&#xD;
courage if you can get anybody to stand sponsor,"&#xD;
continued Horslcy in the calmest manner in the&#xD;
world, throwing his glass of brandy and water full&#xD;
in Johnstone's face.&#xD;
Johnstone was a tall, fine looking fellow, weigh-&#xD;
ing one hundred and eighty-four pounds. Horslcy&#xD;
weighed one hundred and fifteen, and was delicate&#xD;
and sickly, and certainly with the aid of another&#xD;
of his size, Johnstone could have over matched&#xD;
them. But Horsley was spunk all over. John-&#xD;
stone sprang to his feet, and seizing a decanter was&#xD;
about to hurl it at Horslcy's head, when I seized&#xD;
him and said:&#xD;
"Johustone, this won't do~ you are a gentleman,&#xD;
iiot a bully of the causeway-a thing of physical&#xD;
strength-you must settle it like a gentleman.''&#xD;
"True, true," said Iohnstone, taking hold of my&#xD;
hand, "I. forgot myself, Russell. Gentlemen, I&#xD;
'bid you good night."&#xD;
"Good night,~~ we rejoined, all but.Horsley, un-&#xD;

did not start from his chair as Johustone left the&#xD;

is a world of tribulation, and the old gentleman, if&#xD;
he did not feel tribulated, might forget the fact, as&#xD;
I am certain he would, but alas, that the tact&#xD;
should be fixed on him. Now I suppose Prince&#xD;
Salemenes thinks that he will make a hit in my&#xD;

A DUEL ON THE CARPET-JUMPER AS SECOND-&#xD;
SCaNS BETWEEN JUMPER AND MYSELF-JUMPER&#xD;
SUDDENLY DISAPPEARS FROM THE SCENE-CAP-&#xD;
TAIN MERRYMAN~BLADENSBURG-CONVERSA&#xD;
TION WITH HORSLEY-MY PROMISE ABOUT MiSS&#xD;
WATSON.&#xD;
Johnstone's friend, no less a person and no&#xD;
other than Mr. James Jumper, called on Horsicy&#xD;
the next morning, and was by him referred to me.&#xD;
Jumper was angry with me for certain remarks&#xD;
which it was reported to him I had made with&#xD;
regard to his proposing six cheers for me in the&#xD;
theatre, but I had regarded his coldness with per-&#xD;
fect indifference, which nettled him the more.&#xD;
Jumper was full of the importance of being se-&#xD;
cond in an affair of honor, and I nra satisfied that&#xD;
if it were not for this feeling many duels would&#xD;
have been amicably arranged which have had a&#xD;
fatal termination. The eclat, without any risk, has&#xD;
a great deal of fascination in it.&#xD;
Jumper was very dignified when he called on&#xD;
me. For the first time I believe in his life he&#xD;
called rue Mr. Russell.&#xD;
"Take a seat, Jjrnmy,~~ said I, handing him a&#xD;
chair in Mrs. Watson's little parlor, for that lady&#xD;
had insisted upon it that I should occupy her rooms&#xD;
while I was sick, (she wanted me to marry her&#xD;
daughter) and Miss Watson's company was so&#xD;
agreeable that I never thought of declining.&#xD;
"Take a seat, Jimmy," said I.&#xD;
Jimmy looked dignified, and said he had waited&#xD;
on me at the request of his friend, Mr. Johustons,&#xD;
who had sent him to 1-loreley, who sent him to&#xD;
inc.&#xD;
%~Ji~my,~~ said I, "are you fond of fighting?"&#xD;
"Never, Mr. Russell, but when my honor is&#xD;
&#xD;
RUSSELL.                                  55&#xD;
"Your honor concerned! Suppose I was to pull&#xD;
your nose until it profusely bled, would you think&#xD;
/&#xD;
your honor concerned, or would you merely soap&#xD;
your nose?"&#xD;
"Mr. Russell, you and I are old friends. I am&#xD;
sent here on the business of Mr. Johusrone."&#xD;
"Mr. .Johnstone! Suppose I was to pull your&#xD;
nose and kick you, what would you do?"&#xD;
My readers must remember that all this time I&#xD;
was under the strongest excitement, and what is&#xD;
strange, I can remember such scenes much more&#xD;
vividly than I can those of ordinary occurrences.&#xD;
I mean generally I can, for sometimes I cannot re-&#xD;
member anything that has occurred, or if I do,,&#xD;
mine is like Cassio'~ memory after his excess.&#xD;
"Well," said I, ".Mr. Jumper. I expect we'll&#xD;
all have to fight. I feel like fighting; what say&#xD;
you?~~&#xD;
"I don't tbel like fighting, ~ Russell, but my&#xD;
principal does."&#xD;
"Hang your principal. My question is, will&#xD;
you fight me? I feel like it."&#xD;
"Mr. Russell," rejoined Mr. Jumper, "I have no&#xD;
reason to fight with you."&#xD;
"To fight with me! Suppose I say that John-&#xD;
stone is not a gentleman, what will you do then, ac-&#xD;
cording to the laws of the duello? You have got&#xD;
yourself, Jumper, into an awful fix, and I have a&#xD;
great mind to blow your brains out."&#xD;
"Blow my brains out! Sir, Mr. Russell, I came&#xD;
here peaceably.~~&#xD;
"Came here peaceably! Why, you craven cow-&#xD;
ard, you bring my friend a challenge-do you call&#xD;
that peaceably. I have a great mind to kick you.&#xD;
What would you say if I were to kick you-kick&#xD;
you fearfully?"&#xD;
"Mr. Russell, I am here for my friend, Mr.&#xD;
Johnstone."&#xD;
"Suppose yon are, sir, and suppose I chose to&#xD;
kick you."&#xD;
"Sir, Mr. Russell, you would 'not offer me such&#xD;
an Qutr5gO.~~&#xD;
"Outrage! if Johustone and Horeley fight.-you&#xD;
know what a shot I am-I have pledged Horsley,&#xD;
whatever the result my be, to kill you on the&#xD;
spot."&#xD;
"Kill mc on the spot! Sir, that would be&#xD;
murder."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC8021-00000027"/>&#xD;
"I know it would, to look at it calmly, but I&#xD;
tnean to kill you ht hot blood, and put in the plea&#xD;
of insanity. By Jove, old fellow, I will walk&#xD;
over your grave, not that I will plant flowers there,&#xD;
but I shall contemplate your final resting place&#xD;
with much satisfaction."&#xD;
"1 ~m much obliged to you, sir," exclaimed&#xD;
Jumper, who seemed to think that the plea of in-&#xD;
sanity was good in the premises.&#xD;
"Obliged to me-a bullet in your brains certainly&#xD;
confers a great obligation on the head where such a&#xD;
substance finds a lodgment-&#xD;
"Ashes to dabes, why not lead to lead?"&#xD;
"Jumper. Horsley is my friend. This business&#xD;
must be settled-must be. Johnstone is a good&#xD;
shot, so am I, better than you are. It is the fool-&#xD;
ishness of intoxication, and I do not mean to let it&#xD;
end in murder. Not a bit of it. Horslcy is a pe-&#xD;
culiar man, very; it is his temperament, his nature,&#xD;
and he is as brave as Cmsar-I don't doubt John-&#xD;
stoue's courage-it's a foolish affair."&#xD;
"I think so myself," said Jumper.&#xD;
"Then let's end it-you have Johastone's char-&#xD;
acter in your hands."&#xD;
"Hang ~ exclaimed Jumper, "but you&#xD;
know what a stubborn fellow he is. But I will go&#xD;
and see him," and so speaking, and before I could&#xD;
make any reply, Jumper hastily withdrew.&#xD;
The next morning who should call on me but&#xD;
Captain Merryman, of the Navy, a regular fire&#xD;
eater, who said that Mr. .Jumper had suddenly left&#xD;
town on pressing business, and that hi 4 friend,&#xD;
Mr. Johustone, had called on him to ask him to&#xD;
see me in the unfortunate and delicate affair be-&#xD;
tween himself and Mr. Horsley.&#xD;
"I am sorry to say to you, Mr. Russell," he&#xD;
continued, "that unless an unqualified and ample&#xD;
apology is made by Mr. Horsley, a meeting must&#xD;
be had between them."&#xD;
He handed me Mr. Johnstone's note, which ran&#xD;
explicitly to that effect. It was most peremptory.&#xD;
I koew that Horeley would not apologize, for he&#xD;
had told me so, and [knew the fighting propensi&#xD;
ties ef iVierryman, so all I could do was to arrange&#xD;
a meeting three days thereafter near Bladensburg.&#xD;
When we got to Bladensburg we found at the&#xD;
hotel, where, we stopped, that .Johnstone and Capt.&#xD;
&#xD;
Merrymart had got there before us, and had gone&#xD;
on to Washington.&#xD;
In conversation, floreley told me that he meant&#xD;
to fire in the air, and see thereafter if the matter&#xD;
could not besettled. We went to his room.&#xD;
"I have never had, as you know, ~ said&#xD;
he, "an affair of honor, and as I do not feel, 50 1&#xD;
must not show the shadow of a shade of the white&#xD;
feather."&#xD;
"The terms ~ said I, "as you know, ten&#xD;
paces with pistols. One, two, three, fire, and to&#xD;
fire at any time between one and the word. When&#xD;
we get on the ground and toss up for the word, if I&#xD;
get it I shalt give it very deliberately; so--one--&#xD;
two-three-fire. 1 suspect Johustone, who is a&#xD;
good shot, very good, will fire quickly, and that&#xD;
is your chance. But, Horsicy, don't you think&#xD;
that you ought to fire at him'?-it's throwing your&#xD;
life away.'?&#xD;
"Well, it ain't worth much, still I have no&#xD;
desire to die, yet I have a presentiment of that&#xD;
"But hang presenitments, they are like old wo-&#xD;
men's dreams, foregone conclusions upon fixed facts,&#xD;
'Cowards die many deaths, the brave but once.'&#xD;
"But you had better, Russell, go on to the cap-&#xD;
itol, and get the physician to whom we were re-&#xD;
commended. I should hate, if I get a limb broken,&#xD;
to have it badly set and limp for life. You can&#xD;
just write him a note if you do not feel like going.&#xD;
Now, my friend, I should like to be left alone; I&#xD;
have some letters to write and other matters to at-&#xD;
tend to. if you stay all night in Washington, don't&#xD;
fail to be out here early. Wake me, should I be&#xD;
asleep, for I may be up late writing, and, when I&#xD;
fall to sleep, sleep longer than is my wont. Take&#xD;
every explanation, my dear friend, should I fall, to&#xD;
my father. Do your best, Russell-practice your&#xD;
utmost address to relieve his feelings. The old&#xD;
gentleman's religious notions will be terribly shock-&#xD;
ed-maybe he will congratulate himself that I am&#xD;
gone and out of sin's way for the future. Russell.&#xD;
there's one thing I want you to promise me."&#xD;
"It is promised," I replied, "what is it'?"&#xD;
"The a~tress-that beautiful and most gifted crea-&#xD;
ture, Miss Watson,"&#xD;
"She can take care of herself," I said.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
WILLIAIVI RUSSELL.&#xD;
&#xD;
57&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, but you shall not evade it. Promise me that I am a man of courage, when I would show&#xD;
in the emphatic word that you will not wrong much more courage by defying its law of honor and&#xD;
her."                                        resting upon the law of God."&#xD;
&#xD;
I know not why-I entertained no design of such&#xD;
a character against Miss Watson, yet I hesitated.&#xD;
Alas, I fear my owe. heart recoiled upon itself at&#xD;
having a promise fixed there to a friend who&#xD;
might be no more to-morrow-when I did not&#xD;
know what that to-morrow-what the future&#xD;
might bring to me and others in the wild career of&#xD;
human passions that seemed bursting on me in my&#xD;
opening manhood.&#xD;
"Will you not promise me, Russell'?" exclaimed&#xD;
Horslcy, in tones that startled me, "shall I leave&#xD;
life to-morrow, and with it the only faith that I&#xD;
have ever had in any man's friendship?"&#xD;
"But, my dear Horslcy, this is not friendship, it&#xD;
is all nonsense. What has Miss Watson to do&#xD;
with any friendship between you and me'?"&#xD;
"Nothing, only I want you to pledge me upon&#xD;
the faith of that friendship that you will not wrong&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"Horaley, my friend," I exclaimed, "you are&#xD;
morbid-indeed you are. What has any little&#xD;
matter that is-"&#xD;
"Russell, that is a foul insinuation."&#xD;
I laughed, though I felt annoyed.&#xD;
"Well, really Horslcy, what are you driving at.'&#xD;
"Russell, you know how long we have been&#xD;
friends. I know I am about to do a foolish act to-&#xD;
morrow, because the world and the world's law&#xD;
require it, and I have not courage enough to suf-&#xD;
fer under the imputation of the want of courage.~~&#xD;
"Have you not? [ should have thought, from&#xD;
my knowledge of your character, that you had,"&#xD;
"Well, be satisfied, I have not. I am like the&#xD;
Roman Lucretia; she suffered herself to be used&#xD;
and abused by Tnrquin, rather than have the inn-&#xD;
puration-though she should die in her purity-&#xD;
rest upon her memory, that she had been used by&#xD;
her slave and was slain in his arms. A christian&#xD;
woman would have died in the pride of her purity&#xD;
-less, a Jewish maiden would so have died.&#xD;
Scott's Rebecca, for instance. No, sir, Lucretia&#xD;
was prouder of the reputation of her chastity than&#xD;
~he was of her chastity itself. So I am going to&#xD;
(10 what I know to be wrong, to keep myself from&#xD;
being wronged. I am going to satisfy the world&#xD;
S&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, but Horsley, if you have such conscien-&#xD;
tious compunction against duelling, why should&#xD;
you fight?"&#xD;
"Sir," said Horsicy, "would you have me com-&#xD;
promise my honor?"&#xD;
'Indeed I would not-~.-but if you have done&#xD;
wrong, why not apologize?"&#xD;
"Apologize, and at this point of the game? No,&#xD;
I shall not apologize. Russell, this is trifling I&#xD;
came here to meet .Johnstone and give him gentle-&#xD;
manly satisfaction, and I have no other desire,&#xD;
though I want you to repeat this conversation to&#xD;
my father, and that- will let him know that I am&#xD;
not altogether recreant to the principles of my&#xD;
education,"&#xD;
"I feel that, my friend; be assured, should the&#xD;
event you anticipate occur, which I don't believe&#xD;
will, I will certainly say all to your father that I&#xD;
can to reconcile him to it."&#xD;
"It is strange how often my old friend Beazely&#xD;
has bech in my mind- of late. He would have&#xD;
justified me, Russell."&#xD;
"I have, no doubt he would," I replied, but I&#xD;
had many doubts, as doubtless my readers have.&#xD;
I understood Horsl es's feelings exactly. In a just&#xD;
cause no man would go further than would he,&#xD;
and he would have given anything if such were&#xD;
the case now. Lie was trying to reconcile himself&#xD;
to himself. a very fruitless effort sometimes.&#xD;
"Let me repeat to you, Russell," he remarked,&#xD;
"in the account you give of this affair to the old&#xD;
gentleman, save his feelings all you can. And&#xD;
now promise me on your honor, that you will neith-&#xD;
er entertain nor practice any evil designs upon Miss&#xD;
Watson, and then leave me."&#xD;
"I promise you," I said solemnly, giving him&#xD;
my hand; "strange that I should quarrel with you&#xD;
fellows in the Potomac for such an insinuation,&#xD;
now you should be so anxious to get me to and that&#xD;
promise that I would not attempt to do the very&#xD;
thing I got angry with you for insinuating that I&#xD;
had the intention of doing."&#xD;
~~Enough,~~ said liorslcy, "we have high au-&#xD;
thority for knowing that the heart of man is deceit-&#xD;
ful and wicked above all things. But your word&#xD;

think you she would have attended you so-"&#xD;
"Stop, Horsley, for God's sake--do you know how&#xD;
yon tempt a man when you t61i him that a woman&#xD;
likes him-how you tempt him to seek to err if&#xD;
that ~voman be not in his sphere of life?"&#xD;
"As to what you call sphere of life, Russell, I&#xD;
don't very particularly regard between the sexes,&#xD;
for I would marry any woman who was respect a-&#xD;
ble, whom I loved. But the night wears, my&#xD;
friend, and I must write some letters."&#xD;
I left Horsley, and obtaining a horse from my&#xD;
landlord, I took the road for Washington. By way&#xD;
ofrehef to my feelings, which were not of the hap-&#xD;
piest, and to my reflections, which were not at all&#xD;
of a complimentary cast to myself, I put my horse&#xD;
to his mettle, and dashed rapidly on.&#xD;

Arrived at Washington, I inquired the way to&#xD;
Gadeby's-for I had never been in the capitol he&#xD;
fore, though brought up so near to it -and there&#xD;
learning the residence of l)r. Lock we A I repaired&#xD;
thither and found the Doctor at home. I explain&#xD;
ed to him the nature of my business. -&#xD;
"Cannot this affair be settled, Mr. Russelt," he&#xD;
asked of irue.&#xD;
"% f~ar Oot, l)oetor," I replied, and stated to&#xD;
1dm the cireittttstances.&#xD;

no acquniniance tO the city, I t~r~ed my steps to&#xD;
the capitol grounds, which I htol miuderstonut were&#xD;
&#xD;
highly cultivated. On visiting a strange city, one&#xD;
is attracted first to the scene which he had heard&#xD;
most of therein, and being laden with gloomy re-&#xD;
flections and presemitiments, it was natural that I&#xD;
should stray thitherward. I must confess I had&#xD;
gloomy forebodings of the fate of my friend. John&#xD;
stone was of a reckless and revengeful disposition.&#xD;
and Merryman I knew was too fond of being in&#xD;
his element, a duel, willingly to get out of' it with-&#xD;
out bloodshed. Horsicy I loved more than a&#xD;
brother, but he was of so 0(1(1 and strange a nature&#xD;
that I did not know, to use a western phrase,&#xD;
which way the stick would break with him. his&#xD;
fearless and (lesperate- courage I had semi tested in&#xD;
a thousand scenes of boyish sport arid adventure,&#xD;
but then he had so runny whimsical notions that&#xD;
there was no knowing when he would he active or&#xD;

WILLIAM RUSSELL.                59&#xD;
&#xD;
different to me-the one who looked on me in my&#xD;
very childhood with so much tenderness and pride.&#xD;
While I was contemplating all this in her charac-&#xD;
ter, between me and the light of her beautiful&#xD;
nature came the dark form of Booth; and while I&#xD;
was trying to scrutinize his conduct towards her,&#xD;
and recalled their being together at the deer oak,&#xD;
ray attention was arrested keenly by voices near&#xD;
me.. I was in the deep shadow of a large tree,&#xD;
reclining on one of the numerous seats which have&#xD;
been placed in the public grounds, and I was con-&#xD;
scions that I must be entirely unseen, even though&#xD;
an observer but a few feet off was trying to scruti -&#xD;
nize my locality. One of the persons, for there&#xD;
were two of theni approaching, whom I recognized&#xD;
in a moment by his Voice as Johustone, sai(l:&#xD;
"Captain Merryman, I am detern~ined to have&#xD;
satisfactory~; if t~1r. Horshey is not careful his indicr-&#xD;
nity to me will cost him his life; he is one of your&#xD;
gentlemen who is proud of his eccentricities, and&#xD;
who thinks hr may insult with impunity whoever&#xD;
he pleases-he can't do that with me, 'Tis said&#xD;
he is a little cracked, h)ut a more deliberate, eon -&#xD;
ning fellow I never saw. 1 mean to punish him&#xD;

"Are you a good ~ asked ~lerrysoari.&#xD;
'The world has so accounted YaP, c4taiu.''&#xD;
''XVeIl. sir, to be frank with you, I ant one of&#xD;

their six p~iwt a day, and I (toti't value the life of&#xD;

''I a~1ree with you in sent noen , 5jf.)~&#xD;
&#xD;
and you may tire any time between the number&#xD;
one and fire. ~f the lot is mine to give the word,&#xD;
I shall speak the first word, the one, very quickly,&#xD;
as if I were going to make short work of it; this&#xD;
~vill probably startle my gentleman, and he will&#xD;
make a hurried and random shot; do you take good&#xD;
aim, and pink him. Take his life or lame him for&#xD;
life just as you feel in the humor. I could do&#xD;
either, I am satisfied, for I am a tolerable shot.&#xD;
To-morrow morning early we'll practice a little.&#xD;
I have heard of yoer skill."&#xD;
"Practice a little," 1 thought to myself, "what&#xD;
a green horn I am, never to have thought of&#xD;
getting ilorsley to practice, and tlieii I consoled&#xD;
inyscW in remembering that I had heard Horsisy&#xD;
say that if he ever was engaged in a duel, he would&#xD;
never think of practicing, for it would see'~s like&#xD;
n~alice aforethought, and morally eonstit~'te mur-&#xD;
der should his aim prove fatal to his adversary.&#xD;
I. had a long argument with him on the subject,&#xD;
without moving hini. While these reflections&#xD;
were passing through my nii.nd, the I)arties passed&#xD;
on out of hearin~4.&#xD;
After stroliin~ suinetinie through iho grounds in&#xD;
not very pleasant reflections on the morrow, I be-&#xD;
took myself to my hotel, trusting that by supply-&#xD;
ic' the inner man with certain apl)lianees of bar&#xD;
and larder there to he found, that I might raise my&#xD;
pit its to a somewhat more cheerful view of things.&#xD;

~'I don't see why a gentleman should not train&#xD;
for the duello just as boxers train for their vulgar&#xD;
fistl.euffs. Their plan is admirable, the trainer&#xD;
gives the trainee just so much to eat and just so&#xD;
much to drink, and exercises him just so much, so&#xD;
that his frame, and consequently his nerves, reach&#xD;
thair highest point of physical power. .Just so it&#xD;
might be in duelling; I have often thought of it. In&#xD;
fact, I always train myself on such occasions, and&#xD;
it has enabled me three several times to drop my&#xD;
man without my receiving so much as a scratch.&#xD;
To be sure Plumboy~s ball went through my&#xD;
pants near the ankle, but his pistol went off in the&#xD;
spasmodic itimp which he gave as my bullet&#xD;
struck him mortally. I'd bet a thousand dollars&#xD;
on it, sir, if the truth could be ascertained, that he&#xD;
was stone (lead before his bullet reached me, for&#xD;
mine struck him directly in the hea4. I had prac-&#xD;
tie~d, Mr. Johnstone, I had practiced at a figure-&#xD;
I have an accurate eye-the very size of Plureboy,&#xD;
which I made myself, and I marked out a heart on&#xD;
it just where Plumboy's heart should be, and&#xD;
by - I used to put my bullet in the centre of&#xD;
It every elip. Mr. Johnston, the thing had he-&#xD;
enme so much a habit with me that I could not&#xD;
have missed it had I been blind fi~ldcd. The&#xD;
papers made a furious noise about it, you remem-&#xD;
her, but trifles don't easily ~carc me. IC a man&#xD;
crosses my path with a woman he' (rot to taie the&#xD;

[had taken a newspaper from the table and held&#xD;
it before my face as if in the act of reading it,&#xD;
while this conversation was going on, when at this&#xD;
point tl~e bar keeper returned with the porter, and&#xD;
apologized for detaining Captain Mer rywan so long,&#xD;
saying that he was searching for a pi~rticuIar ha.&#xD;
portation, which ~as said to he retnakably fi~&#xD;
I put down the newspaper and stoppeti towards the&#xD;
stitad whero the night lanips were placed, when&#xD;
the bar koeporotliciously came tot)Od tO wait OH&#xD;
me, and Captain Merryman turne(I and recognized&#xD;
rae.&#xD;
"Ah," said he, in the franlost tone imaginal~lo,&#xD;
though tt~e hurry of his manner showed that l~,&#xD;
suspected that their conversation had been over-&#xD;
heard by me ''well met, Mr. Russell, will you&#xD;

Not to he out done by the ~ssptain, i t~s cordially&#xD;

~ZGGRAPIIY OF&#xD;
&#xD;
saluted him, and said with pleasure, far I was just&#xD;
thinking of taking a night cap, and turning to Mr.&#xD;
Johastone I remarked it was a beautif~il night, and&#xD;
asked if they had been walking?&#xD;
Johastone was quite confused, and seemed eu-&#xD;
dently at a loss to know whether I had overheard&#xD;
his lemonade resolution or nat.&#xD;
"What did you say you'd take, sir?" inquired&#xD;
the bar keeper of Johnstone.&#xD;
This reassured Itim, for he seemed to reflect that&#xD;
if the bar keeper had not heard him order lemonade,&#xD;
I, who was much farther off, could not have over-&#xD;
heard him, and he replied:&#xD;
"I said I would take lemonade with the privi-&#xD;
lege-make it a punch at once-give me the palo&#xD;
brandy-when I help myself and pour in on the&#xD;
lemonade I always give myself an overdose, as I&#xD;
judge the quantity oy the color, and your pale&#xD;
brandy is as pale as the lemonade itself."&#xD;
It instantly occurred to me that Mr. Johnstone&#xD;
was an~cious to bear himself as if he did not think&#xD;
of the business of the morrow, and I thought I&#xD;
would get theum both drunk if I could, if it cost&#xD;
me a fiend ache in the meriting' and a week's drink-&#xD;
ing to taper off. Xler~ynman had the reputation of'&#xD;
loving his cups, and the training which he had&#xD;
been boasting of, which he had compelled himself&#xD;
to undergo, I stispected at the time, was needful -&#xD;
now-a-tlays with him to restore the former accura-&#xD;
cy of his aim, for which Ito was celebrated. 'rIte&#xD;
(ICairO to see Johnstone drunk that night had flash-&#xD;
ed through niy mind from the very moment I heard&#xD;
him give his reason for drinking lemonade only. I&#xD;
ordered brandy and water, helped myself and took&#xD;
a ~tromtg pull.&#xD;
"1 feel htn~gry,~~ sai(l I, smacking tny lips after&#xD;
the (fraught, ''will you not join me in a snack, gust&#xD;

Very soon I uttaisted upoit it that the gentleinneit&#xD;
shommld (Irink avith toe, which they did, going it&#xD;
rather deeply, amid .Johnstotme taking this titime l)ale&#xD;

''Alt, bar keeper," Ito t~xciaittiod, "this is the&#xD;
&#xD;
same stuff that I drank here last weQk. Gadsbv&#xD;
is the prince of landlords, he always keeps good&#xD;
liquor; whet' he was in our city he kept the best&#xD;
there. I believe my taste was acquired at his&#xD;
bar."&#xD;
"We always try to keep the best, sir," remarked&#xD;
the bar keeper, and before our supper was announc-&#xD;
ed as ready, that individual had helped us all&#xD;
again at the instance of Mr. Johnstone, who swore&#xD;
we should all now drink with him.&#xD;
At supper we ate very heartily, and various&#xD;
kinds of wines were ordered in. 1 cotild plainly&#xD;
see that both gentlemen, and particularly John-&#xD;
stone, were determined to make the impression on&#xD;
my mind that they had forgotten the anticipated&#xD;
meeting in the morning. And I was determined&#xD;
to be just as forgetful as they were. In fact Cap-&#xD;
tain Merryman did soon actually forget it, and as&#xD;
he was to run no risk and had no ~training~~ to&#xD;
undergo himself, he soon forgot all about training&#xD;
his principal. We drank bottle after bottle of&#xD;
champagne, and by a strong exercise of the will,&#xD;
though seemingly as far gone as either of my com-&#xD;
panions, I kept myself "right side up with care"&#xD;
all the time, as is written on the boxes which con-&#xD;
tain glass. Reflecting on die superscription on he&#xD;
boxes aforesaid, and that tlmose who live in glass&#xD;
houses should not throw stones, and furthermore,&#xD;
impressed with the dangerous position of my friend&#xD;
Horaley, I dId nothing to mar the eonvivktlity of'&#xD;
the evening, bitt all I could to advatice amid contin-&#xD;
ue it, by way of testing ~ nerves, while&#xD;
Merryman more than once talked tipon topics likely&#xD;
to make his companion drink deeper. Merryman&#xD;
got. talking about on r perforuxtauce of "Sarda napa-&#xD;
~ and asked itt his eop~', whiny the deuce it was&#xD;
that .Johnstone slid imot play as well time last tunic&#xD;
as the first? lie find evid"ntiy forgotten it, his&#xD;
objurgations that it was the veiny cause of the 'lmal-&#xD;
lenge. .Johustoute filled hinaself a bomoper auid&#xD;
swore he did.&#xD;
"1mb! why, man, you nut aground repeatedly,"&#xD;
&#xD;
61R&#xD;
&#xD;
three several times. I'll leave it to Mr. Russell."&#xD;
Mr. Russell not being at all disposed to become&#xD;
a peace maker on the occasion, replied that "he&#xD;
was so busy with his own part when on the stage&#xD;
that he had no time to think of others, and that&#xD;
when not on, he was in the green room waiting his&#xD;
call; though," I said, "that I thought Mr. John-&#xD;
stone had acquitted himself remarkably to his&#xD;
credit, and so I believed thought the public."&#xD;
"That aint the point," said Merryintin. "I&#xD;
don't care that about the public-they have found&#xD;
fault with me when I should have been praised&#xD;
and praised me when I should have been censured&#xD;
-but the paint is, can a mart miss his part again&#xD;
and again, as Johnstone (lid, and be said to play&#xD;
well."&#xD;
Captain ~erryman,~~ exclaimed Johnstone,&#xD;
"I tell you that I (lid not miss my part," and as&#xD;
he pushed himself back in an energetic effort to&#xD;
strike the table with more force, his chair slipped&#xD;
from the equilibrium of its hind legs, on which he&#xD;
was ballancing himself, and its occupant tumbled&#xD;

Johustone, ~'d you nean to insult roe."&#xD;
"I have done it, sir, 1 take it, if you know wilat&#xD;

towards him with clenched fist-Merryman con-&#xD;
ttnued with sudden cahaness, "you know my&#xD;

,Johnstone was about to reply, when several gen&#xD;
tlemen entered, for we wcre itt tt~e dining room,&#xD;
and Merryman said, in a subdued tone, for his&#xD;
passion seemed somewhat to Itave sobered hito:&#xD;
"This is no place for controversy: to-luorrov.,&#xD;

and the renowned duellist left the roont.&#xD;
Johostone looked at me for a nIolItent as if about&#xD;
te say something, but without doing so he abruptly&#xD;
left tite room by tether door tItan that takert by&#xD;
Merryman, artd evidently much en raged.&#xD;
&#xD;
OTHES.&#xD;
1 thought a moment with some self satisf~etion&#xD;
over the scene which had just occuffed, wonder-&#xD;
ing what would he the upshot of the matter, and&#xD;
whether Johnstone would challenge Merryman and&#xD;
light htrn before he met ilorsley, and thus in all&#xD;
probably prevent their meeting, or whether they&#xD;
would eousider the affair as the emanation of s&#xD;
drunken frolic and be friends in the morning; and&#xD;
so occupied, mentally, I retired to my room, leav-&#xD;
ing orders at the i~ar that I was to be calle at five&#xD;
o'elO(k, and .vislied to have my horse in readiness.&#xD;
At first I thought I had better ride out to Bladena-&#xD;
burg and tell l4orsley of all that had passed; then&#xD;
it occurred to me it would be of no use, and 1 had&#xD;
also a great desire to remain in the city that I&#xD;
might l~arn the result of matters between the prin-&#xD;
cipal and his second in the morning.&#xD;
I was edld according to order early in the&#xD;
morning, and the first tortes which saluted my ear&#xD;
after tie negro's rap, was the voice of his ac&#xD;
quaintance, the hoot black, who ~vas engaged in&#xD;
his Ycotioo at the ind of the passage, and ~vh6 said:&#xD;
"I eay, Saut."&#xD;
''Well,'' said 8a111.&#xD;
"1 say, these here geotlentans what Wears these&#xD;

"Old boy," exclaimed Cokely, in a tone of&#xD;
admiration of his advice, "you've been here so&#xD;

eVery thing; but I tell you this child is getting Ilis&#xD;

When I descended to the bar, I asked the bar&#xD;
keeper if the gentlemen who were with me last&#xD;
nigltt had left yet?&#xD;
"About a quarter of an hour ago," he replied.&#xD;
"Did they go together?"&#xD;
'0! yes, sir, they made friends after tileir fuss&#xD;
last night, and they went off in a fast carriage a&#xD;
quarter of an hour ago."&#xD;
"Made friends-did they take a drink together?"&#xD;
"Oh yes, sir, and Captain t4crrymnan asked for&#xD;
you, and tilat put me in mind of waking you. Mr.&#xD;
Russell."&#xD;
Itrittioted my horse, provoked, firstly, wib these&#xD;
geoth rico, and secondly that they lIdli got the&#xD;
start of mc, and I darted ahead with right good&#xD;
will, and with a kind of fierce feeling of determi-&#xD;
&#xD;
63&#xD;
&#xD;
Threat he was very profane, and it occurred to&#xD;
me, though indistinctly, that some of his profanity&#xD;
lla(l a personal application to myself, but thought I,&#xD;
my bold Captain, we are both of us influenced by&#xD;
last night's supper and extraK, and if you want a&#xD;
fuss with me you can have it when both of us are&#xD;
cooler; at least the greater interest of my friend is&#xD;
on hand, and I will out general you yet, sir cap-&#xD;
tain.&#xD;
As I entered Bladensburg I saw a horseman&#xD;
by the woodside just where you enter from Wash-&#xD;
ington, who, eyeing me with much keenness, that&#xD;
had the look of a- right to do it, said:&#xD;
"One moment, sir."&#xD;
"Not a moment," I replied, "business presses&#xD;
OH me,"&#xD;
"BIll I've got a right," said he, "and I corn&#xD;
roand you in tht' name of the lrt~v."&#xD;
So speaking he turned upon rae, and two others&#xD;
on horseback, who were behind a bush beside the&#xD;
road, and whom I had not seen, advanced. I&#xD;
stopped and asked them what they meant?&#xD;
"Ain't your name liorsicy?" ask~~ my first in~-&#xD;
terrupter.&#xD;
In a utomertt I saw wltat was out. Somebody&#xD;
(the doctor I presumed) had given information of&#xD;
the intended duel, and a writ Itad been issued to&#xD;
arrest Johestone artd ilorslcy. -&#xD;
"That is my natrte," mid I.&#xD;
"f know it ia, Mr. Horslcy," replied the first&#xD;
person "answers the description," said he, turn~&#xD;
ilIg to one of his empaltions-."sorry, sir, but there&#xD;
is a duel on hand. an'~ 5ave orders to arrest yout&#xD;

fore them.                                             "Ab, then I must go with you."&#xD;
Still, what I should say to Ilorslcy was tln- I knew nothing about the law of arrest in these&#xD;
settled in toy mind, and, thought I Could not help triatters, or whether I was iti Maryland, t)r witat&#xD;

arrest for him. This would apprise him of tL&#xD;
cause of my absence and leave him free to 'act.&#xD;
I stopped the negro and told him II wished&#xD;
send a message to Bladensburg by him to in&#xD;
tavern keeper, and asked him if he would carry&#xD;
if I paid him well for it.&#xD;
"I won't do anything else master, sartain, for&#xD;
lives dar," replied the African, delighted at th&#xD;
reward.&#xD;
I felt in vain in my pockets for a scrap of paper&#xD;
I had none.&#xD;
"Gentlemen," said I, turning to my attendants&#xD;
"I want a bit of paper on which to write a noti&#xD;
to my landlord about my baggage in Bladensburg&#xD;
have you a bit of blank paper about you."&#xD;
"If you say it is riot to let your second knovi&#xD;
anything of the matter, certainly," said Captair&#xD;
Wilson, who was the person who arrested me, and&#xD;
who commanded the party.&#xD;
"I have no second in my matters yet, gentle-&#xD;
men, I assure you,~~ said I, glad of the chance of&#xD;
a prevarication, which looked free of falsehood,&#xD;
though evidently it was meant to deceive, and&#xD;
therefore was not so pure as might be.&#xD;
The leaf of a letter, blank all but its superscrip-&#xD;
tion, for there did not exist then the universal&#xD;
system of envelopes, was handed to me by:Captain&#xD;
Wilsonand in a very careless way, on the top of&#xD;
my hat, I wrote a hasty note to Horsley. I gave&#xD;
it to the boy and told him aside to ask the landlord&#xD;
of th~ hotel to have it sent with the note to the&#xD;
room of the gentleman to whom it was directed.&#xD;
"No," said I, ~ as a brighter thought&#xD;
struck me. "There"-giving him Horsicy's di-&#xD;
rection on a piece of paper-"ask the landlord to&#xD;
show you to that gentleman's room, and when you&#xD;
see the gentleman give hi1n that note. Do you&#xD;
hear'?"&#xD;
"Yes, ~ and he hesitated.&#xD;
"Ah, and here's a dollar for y~u; tell the gentle-&#xD;
man when you give him the note that I said he&#xD;
twist give you another dollar."&#xD;
"What brought your name be, master?"&#xD;
"I-Iorsley-Mr. Horsley-arid when you see&#xD;
me again I'll give you another ~&#xD;
"Whar does you think 1 shall see you, was&#xD;
ter?"&#xD;
&#xD;
iy "In Bladensburg, to-morrow; don't forget I&#xD;
me f owe you another dollar,"&#xD;
The blackey's eyes goggled at the idea of his&#xD;
,o forgetting it, and then he ha-hawed right out, as&#xD;
y the humor of the thing struck him, and he started,&#xD;
t off briskly on his way, holding his dollar in his&#xD;
clenched fist as if he meant to feel that it was safe.&#xD;
I   The negro was not out of sight, when who&#xD;
e should our cavalcade meet but the carriage con-&#xD;
taining .Johnstone and his friend the captain. They&#xD;
were evidently taking it leisurely, under the cap-&#xD;
tain's directions. To be in a hurry even to show&#xD;
one's courage would not haye been cool enough for&#xD;
~ the gallant captain. They evidently were talking&#xD;
very pleasantly, the captain appeared anecdotical,&#xD;
for .Johnstone laughed loud at something or other&#xD;
his companion was telling, though there was some-&#xD;
thing in the ring of his laugh which was not all&#xD;
merriment.&#xD;
As we advanced to the side of the carriage I&#xD;
- could see Johnstone in the act of relighting his&#xD;
cigar, which had gone out, maybe during his hearty&#xD;
laugh. Jolinstone was laying back apparently at&#xD;
his ease, while Merryman was evidently so, for&#xD;
his feet were protruded voluptuously on the seat in&#xD;
front of him, and he was pleasantly watching the&#xD;
escape of the smoke from his lips, which he had&#xD;
retained there for his amusement, while Johnstone&#xD;
relighted his cigar.&#xD;
Johastone was the first to see me, and he bolted&#xD;
into an upright position and unconsciously repeated&#xD;
my name:&#xD;
"Mr. Russell!"&#xD;
The officers started and looked at each other,&#xD;
while I, without seeming to notice them, said:&#xD;
"Horslcy, if you please, sir."&#xD;
"Ha, Mr. Horslcy," exclaimed Captain Merry-&#xD;
man, with a coolness which reminded me of&#xD;
Peterson's at our first juvenile rivalry in recitation,&#xD;
"ab, glad to see you, sir; we are on a little gunning&#xD;
excursion after wild fowl, we trust that the game&#xD;
is not scared offi"&#xD;
"Scared off!" I exclaimed, losing for a moment&#xD;
my self' possession, and about to utter that which&#xD;
might have betrayed the real state of the case,&#xD;
"0! no, sir, I'~~ left game enough there for you&#xD;
yet-at least for a shot or two."&#xD;
The officers of the law whispered apart and&#xD;
&#xD;
9&#xD;
&#xD;
looked suspicious, but said nothing, while the car-&#xD;
riage, the driver of which had slackened his horses&#xD;
to a walk during our short colloquy, now started&#xD;
into a quicker pace.&#xD;
"One moment, captain, let me say a word to&#xD;
you," I called out, when the carriage had passed&#xD;
out of hearing of the officers.&#xD;
"Excuse me a moment, gentlemen," I said to&#xD;
Captain Wilson and his party, and imitating the&#xD;
coolness of Captain Merryrnan, I rode up to his&#xD;
carriage, and told him, in a low tone, that I had&#xD;
been arrested in mistake for Horsley, and that I&#xD;
would not undeceive the officers until I heard from&#xD;
i-Iorsley.&#xD;
"I have sent a black boy with a note to my friend&#xD;
explaining matters, Captain Merryman."&#xD;
"It's a mere circumstance, sir," replied the gal-&#xD;
lant Captain, "a mere circumstance. Your friend&#xD;
is our man, sir. Pardon me, sir, I say it as a&#xD;
matter of congratulation, not of reproach; your&#xD;
friend will find some one more familiar with these&#xD;
matters than you are."&#xD;
I felt my cheek tinge at his matter of conirratu-&#xD;
lation, which was meant for insult, and replied:&#xD;
"Yes, you are right, captain, religious people&#xD;
call these matters murders, as you know, (he had&#xD;
been called repeatedly a murderer in the j)apers) but&#xD;
you gentlemen who perpetrate them in an honora-&#xD;
ble way, think nothing of' them, though morally,&#xD;
as second, if you cause a death you are as much of&#xD;
a murderer as though you~were the principal."&#xD;
"Ha, ha, quite sevc.me, sir. Doubtless your ar-&#xD;
rest has then relieved you h~oin anxiety. But, sir,&#xD;
we must hasten on," and he raised his hat and told&#xD;
the boy 'to drive on.' I raised mine also and felt&#xD;
very much like flinging it in his face, at the same&#xD;
time I doubted very much whether I had spoken&#xD;
in good taste.&#xD;
I could not but smile, however, as I joined Cap-&#xD;
tain Wilson and his companions, to mark how&#xD;
moucil their suspicion of something wnng was~&#xD;
aroused, and 110W completely they were at fault&#xD;
a- to the existing state of things.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
FALL INTO CONVERSATION WITh CAPTAIN WILSON-HE&#xD;
OROWS VERY TALKATIVE-TIlE DUEL BETWEEN COLO-&#xD;
NET. U. AND DOCTOR 13.-BLOODY I5I.AND-THE AD&#xD;
VENTURE OF THE hEAR-AMERICAN ANt) FRENCHMAN&#xD;
-A DUEL THE CONSEQUENCE-WILSON '5 REASONS FOE&#xD;
1115 DUEL-SUDDEN ANI) UNEXPECTED INTERRUPTION.&#xD;
Not meaning to~commit myself any fotl~r in&#xD;
deception than was necessary to accomplish my&#xD;
purpose, (the way with most deceivers, by the&#xD;
bye,) and perchance fearing that something I might&#xD;
let slip might betray me, I said nothing to my ar-&#xD;
resters upon the subject of my arrest. In fact they&#xD;
had deceived themselves in their eagerness to ar-&#xD;
rest Horsicy, betraying themselves to me in a way&#xD;
which I thought justified me in playing Elorsley,&#xD;
for the sake of the honor of my friend. Yet as we&#xD;
rode along, several times it occurred to me that I&#xD;
bad better tell Captain Wilson who I was, and&#xD;
without advising him to do so, contrive that he&#xD;
should return to Bladenshurg and arrest Ilorsley,&#xD;
for when I reflected upon Merryman's coolness and&#xD;
the aid his previous knowledge of duelling matters&#xD;
and so fbrth would give .lohnstone, I trembled for&#xD;
my friend, who I had no donot would easily get&#xD;
another secon(l. But I said to myself I am bound&#xD;
to guard the honor of Horsicy, who has l)tlt his&#xD;
trust in Toe, and I asked Captain Wilson:&#xD;
"Have you made many arrests aftcr this fashion,&#xD;
sir?"&#xD;
"Why yes, sir--but not so many as formerly&#xD;
sAving your preserlee, sir, the thing~~ not as fluili-&#xD;
joriable as it used to he. Members of Congress&#xD;
ain't as high flown as they used to be-they dun't&#xD;
stand o4 pints as they used to--though when we&#xD;
get some of the Southern liotspurs here, they are&#xD;
very bilious towards Northern men, and flares up&#xD;
easily."&#xD;
"I fave you witnessed mimany duels'?" I asked.&#xD;
~ you think th~ sw~onds eoull generally&#xD;
settle it?"&#xD;
"Almost always. sir, except in a case like that&#xD;
of Burr and I larnilton, when Burr was hound to&#xD;
fight. lie was all fitrht, -sir game all over-Ifam-&#xD;
ilton knowed jt-J have always thought he knowed&#xD;
that Burr meant to kill hits, and he kind of pre&#xD;

&#xD;
pared himself for it. He said duelling waswrong,&#xD;
but he couldn't stand the public opinion."&#xD;
"I remember," I replied, "reading the corres-&#xD;
pondence between Burr and Hamilton-I agree&#xD;
with you-I always thought that Hamilton antici-&#xD;
pated his fate."&#xD;
"Yes, sir," replied Captain Wilson, "and there-&#xD;
fore two men so notoriously brave to go out to&#xD;
prove their courage, strikes me as great foolishness.&#xD;
Saving your presence, it's a very foolish business&#xD;
any how."&#xD;
"Yes, it is a very foolish business any how, but&#xD;
yet two such wise men as Burr and Hamilton&#xD;
fought, to say nothing of a thousand others as wise&#xD;
&#xD;
me to be on the ground. The colonel thought it&#xD;
would be a Street fight-he had pluck and pre.&#xD;
pared himself accordingly-but the doctor said that&#xD;
if lie had introduced the colonel to his wife, and&#xD;
~ut confidence in him and given him in that way&#xD;
endorsement in his family, he would have shot him&#xD;
down like a dog, but that was not the thing; the&#xD;
lady was the colonel's casual acquaintance, !made&#xD;
at a ball, and she had encouraged his attentions&#xD;
from the first."&#xD;
"Hair-splitting casuistry," I said.&#xD;
'Well, I don't know, sir, but so said the doc-&#xD;
tor. The colonel," he said, "ought to have re~&#xD;
spected his honor, be the lady what she might, but&#xD;
&#xD;
and as brave."                                the colonel had not violated his friendship or be-&#xD;
"But you look very young,~~ remarked Captain traded his confidence."&#xD;
Wilson.                                          "Ha!" said I, "Othello says that Desdemona&#xD;
"I am young, sir, and therefore with not much must die-&#xD;
experience to make me discreet-Hamilton and&#xD;
Burr were both middle aged men, yet they fought,       'Else sbe'll betray more men."'&#xD;
and their courage was unquestioned.~~            "I don't know about that," replied the captain.&#xD;
~.rI7rue, sir, but it was the fashion them days," "but at any rate the doctor was determined to kill&#xD;
replied Captain Wilson.                        thecolonel, if he could, for the sake of his honor,&#xD;
"You've seen a good many duels, have you, sir?" but he said under the eireumstances it should be&#xD;
1 asked.                                       done in a fair field."&#xD;
"Yes, sir! About the keenest I ever saw  was   "Ah, so the doctor thought it was a fair field,&#xD;
between two gentlemen in the North state, that is, was it, when the colonel eloped with his lady?"&#xD;
North Carolina~-one of them was from South Car-  "Can't say, sir; you have me there. My notions&#xD;
alma. They went on the ground feeling deadly is that if a woman is good she is good, and if she&#xD;
against each other. One of them had run away means to play the deuce she'll play the deuce&#xD;
with the other's wife; he was a single man, and any how."&#xD;
the married man was bent on vengeance. Maybe "You have experience of the sex, Captain Wil-&#xD;
you~ve heard of the story?~~                   son," I remarked.&#xD;
"Not that I know of."                         "Some, sir, some. But these pints of honor&#xD;
"Well, one, the single man, was a M. C. from is monstrous nice, so nice I never could get the&#xD;
the North state, Col. G., and the married man hang of them. Sir, we have five senses, we taste,&#xD;
was Dr. B. The lady had gone off to St. Louis smell, see, hear and feel, and then we have a sixth&#xD;
with the colonel. I was traveling round then- sense, sir, the sense of honor, but to my mind it's 4&#xD;
it's been many years ago-to see whar to settle, an acquired sense, sir, like the acquired appetite&#xD;
and I ~vent up the river with the doctor, who was for cigars, tobacco and Jiquor-the last, though,&#xD;
on his way to St. Louis in pursuit of her. My comes pretty easy after while. I goes the whole&#xD;
mind is, if a woman won't stay with me, she can on 'em. But, sir, they goes out on Bloody Island&#xD;
go; I don't mean to make my crime equal to her's in the river, opposite St. Louis, that is, the colonel&#xD;
by committing murder-but many men, many and the doctor did-they call it Bloody Island he~&#xD;
minds. The doctor was bent on killing the col., cause of the many duels fought there-and they&#xD;
and he said he would do it in a fair fight-he was went it at ten paces-both dead shots. Well~&#xD;
a great shot. He liked me, and though lie held sir, the first fire the colonel hits the right arm, the&#xD;
himself high up in society, lie said he would like pistol arm, of the doctor, and the ball broke hi~&#xD;

arm, glanced and went into his heart. As the&#xD;
doctor fell over, for I was near h~m and saw the&#xD;
expression of hi~ eye, he kind of kicked his arm&#xD;
up with his knee-mind I saw it-and off went&#xD;
his pistol. The colonel never kicked afterwards.&#xD;
The doctor fell, rested on his left arm, looked stern&#xD;
at the colonel, and when he saw he was dead, he&#xD;
stretched himself out, and died a kind of content-&#xD;
edly as I thought. He had hit the colonel plum&#xD;
in the head, and it was the doctor's opiniou it was&#xD;
done after the doctor was hit in the heart, for they&#xD;
probed the wound and found the bullet in his&#xD;
heart. You look unbelieving."&#xD;
"Why, no, it is said of General Jackson," I re-&#xD;
plied, "that he was wounded by his antagonist,&#xD;
and did not know it until after he had killed him&#xD;
and he was leaving the ground with one of his&#xD;
seconds, who showed him the marks of blood on&#xD;
his clothes. Sir, said the general, as he examined&#xD;
the wound, I should have killed him, sir; I had&#xD;
made up my mind: I should have killed him if his&#xD;
bullet had gone into my brain. It's merely show-&#xD;
ing what resolution will do."&#xD;
"Fact, sir," replied Captain Wilson," ha! ha!&#xD;
I heard tell on a fellow that went away up en the&#xD;
V~ellow Stone a hunting with a Frenchman. They&#xD;
left their canoe-the American and the French-&#xD;
man did-on the new banks, and they went two&#xD;
days travel into the wilderness, when one day an-&#xD;
beknowns-"&#xD;
"Where are you from?" said I, struck with his&#xD;
pronunciation.&#xD;
"Why I'm from everywhere, but I was born&#xD;
in Tennessee, got a place here from the Mayor&#xD;
and City Council appointments," winking hard&#xD;
at me, "though I'm in general politics, not the&#xD;
right side up either. But as I was saying, unbe-&#xD;
knowus to him, the American, he falls into a fight&#xD;
with a barr and the animal tears him a~vfully-&#xD;
however, he happens to give him a mortal dig at&#xD;
last with his knife and laW Mr. Bruin out. There's&#xD;
a good many kind of di ~ls: some is fashionable&#xD;
and some is unfashionable, but the American's was&#xD;
in an awful case."&#xD;
"Most brutally treated," I interposed.&#xD;
"Yes, sir, bearishly, but that ain't the ~vorst of it&#xD;
nor the best of it. The Frenchman carried his&#xD;
friend on his back, after he had helped him to dress&#xD;

his wounds, the better part of the day, towards&#xD;
the river where the canoe was, and there being&#xD;
more than a day~s travel to reach the canoe, he&#xD;
concluded-the Frenchman did-that he could'nt&#xD;
take the American-he was a Tennesseean-any&#xD;
further, so he put him down."&#xD;
"What, left him!" I exclaimed.&#xD;
"He put him down, but the American reasoned&#xD;
with him and begged that he would no~ leave him*&#xD;
to die there. The Frenchman said he would have&#xD;
to do it, as Indians were on their track, and he&#xD;
started to leave. The American begged him for&#xD;
God's sake to load his rifle for him and leave it by&#xD;
his side; yon know, says he, I can u~e one hand,&#xD;
and maybe it may save my life from Indians, or&#xD;
get me some game. Just load me my rifle-~if my&#xD;
bruised legs won't let me walk, I can crawl, maybe&#xD;
after awhile. Just leave my bowie knife too,&#xD;
near by in trim. 'So to this the Frenchman consent-&#xD;
ed, glad to make some kind of excuse to himself&#xD;
for nor deserting his friend without some hope for&#xD;
him, and he accordingly loaded his rifle, placed it&#xD;
by him, and took an affectionate leave of Monsieur&#xD;
friend, the American, but the American couldn't&#xD;
stand it, so lie made one desperate effort, raised&#xD;
his rifle, and said to the Freriichman, promise to&#xD;
take me on your back to the canoe or I'll shoot&#xD;
you on the spot. That was a dead fall to the&#xD;
Frenchman, I tell you. He had to do it. He&#xD;
took the American on his back, with the American&#xD;
holding the bowie knife right at his throat all the&#xD;
way to the canoe. When they got there the&#xD;
American made Monsieur Frog seat him in the&#xD;
canoe, and he held a bee line on him with his rifle&#xD;
till the Frenchman paddled him all the way to the&#xD;
settlements."&#xD;
I could not but laugh heartily at the story, and&#xD;
I thought Captain Wilson was certainly a green&#xD;
chap for the captain of the watch of the metropo-&#xD;
lis of the nation, but then I reflected that politics,&#xD;
like poverty, makes us acquainted with strange&#xD;
bed fellows, and I concluded that under some hocus&#xD;
pocus or other of political transmutation, the cap-&#xD;
tain was where he was. He seemed infinitely&#xD;
more disposed to talk than at first, and I began to&#xD;
think how much I had been mistaken in his charac-&#xD;
ter in taking him, its I did, for a sedate personage.&#xD;
"That was'nt all of it," he continued, after a&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC8021-00000033"/>&#xD;
68&#xD;
&#xD;
pause. "The Frenchman, when he afterwards&#xD;
met the American in St. Louis, challenged him, I&#xD;
was informed, and they went out and faught on&#xD;
Bloody Island, and the American served him worse&#xD;
than the bear served the American himself, for he&#xD;
shot his nose off, and it's a~vful to hear a French-&#xD;
man speak broken English through a brokeui nose?'&#xD;
I could not but laugh heartily at this.&#xD;
"The joke of it was that the Frenchman had told&#xD;
how he had helped the American all through&#xD;
friendship and politeness, and the American had&#xD;
contradicted the story. The American said he&#xD;
rode him like the man of the mountain rode Sin-&#xD;
bad the sailor, or Sinbad the sailor rode the man&#xD;
of the mountain, I forget which."&#xD;
~ strange," said I, "that the Frenchman did&#xD;
not refuse at first outright."&#xD;
"Why, he would have got killed outright."&#xD;
"Well, but it occurs to me, he, in the long&#xD;
time the American was on his back, or while&#xD;
they were in the boat, might have got rid of&#xD;
him, or got away from hire."&#xD;
"Ah, the American was holding on for his life,&#xD;
and he had the Frenchman under cow."&#xD;
"That's true."&#xD;
"True, it's everything-when you get a fellow&#xD;
under cow he's gone. There ain't nothing left of&#xD;
him but fever and ague. The Frenchman was so&#xD;
laughed at when the story got told 'round that he&#xD;
grew as brave as a lion, and wanted to fiuht after&#xD;
he had his nose shot off, but his seconds wouldn't&#xD;
let him."&#xD;
"You believe the story,~~ I said.&#xD;
"Why not? it's as good a story as the next one,&#xD;
and first rate grounds for a dueWain't it. If that&#xD;
ain't putting upon a man I don't know. It was&#xD;
one hundred and sixty pounds of human nature,&#xD;
and the Frenchman was small at that-his consti-&#xD;
tution, like his character, never recovered.&#xD;
~ said I to myself, "the character of&#xD;
Captain Wilson, like the unfolding of some&#xD;
curious toy, is opening out."&#xD;
"You would not, 1 suppose, Mr. 1-lorslcy, now,&#xD;
considering my present position, take rue for an&#xD;
arusrocrat, would you?"&#xD;
"Why not?" I asked.&#xD;
"Why nut? hecause appearances are against me&#xD;
-hut I am an aruntocrat -.1 am descended from&#xD;
&#xD;
one of the F. F. V.-one of the first families in&#xD;
Virginia."&#xD;
"Yes, sir, fact, one of the first families in Vir-&#xD;
ginia. I am descended from the Monboddoes.&#xD;
You've hearn tell of Lord Mouboddo, who wrote&#xD;
a book to prove that men were monkeys all but the&#xD;
tails?"&#xD;
"Yes," I replied, smiling.&#xD;
"Well, sir, I am descended from that family-&#xD;
I'm one of the tails. We changed our names to&#xD;
Wilson in the revolutionary war by act of the le-&#xD;
gislature, because the old branch took the tory side.&#xD;
But talking about duels, my family pride like to&#xD;
have cost me my life-it did cost me a duel.".&#xD;
"Yes, sir-the Wilsons, my ancestors, emigrated&#xD;
to Tennessee, disgusted' with the toryism of their&#xD;
ancestors, and though we hated the tory notions of&#xD;
the old branch, we were proud of the blood. Well,&#xD;
I had some little money in my younger days and&#xD;
so I went down to New Orleans, a good looking&#xD;
fellow, though I say it myself, just six foot in my&#xD;
stocking feet, and well proportioned, and about the&#xD;
best blood in my veins, if you were there just to&#xD;
analyse it, as far as healthy blood goes, tn-the&#xD;
country, and as far as family goes, the best blood&#xD;
on top of the ground throughout the States. Do yqu&#xD;
know, Mr. elorsley, where the best mint in the&#xD;
world growsI~&#xD;
"No," I said, wondering what was coming next.&#xD;
"Well, it grows in the grave yards of old Vir-&#xD;
ginay-it grows our of the best blood too, of the&#xD;
old families, in consequence of their drinking so&#xD;
many mint tulips, and it sprouts spontaneous!"&#xD;
"It does?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, and I can prove it any day in any of&#xD;
the old Episcopal grave yards in old Vmrginav."&#xD;
"But the duel," I said, and as we rode side by&#xD;
side, the others in the rear, tho captain talked on&#xD;
in the glibest fhsbion, our horses' hoofs making bait&#xD;
very little inte~ruptiou as they fell on the unpaved&#xD;
road.&#xD;

with eyes like living coaW. and she sailed along&#xD;
like a swallow over lake Ponchartrain, and then,&#xD;
said I to myself, that pocket full of rocks she has!&#xD;
I thought thus while I was taking my julip, mean-&#xD;

prise, that the sudden stoppage of his steed flung&#xD;
him directly over the head of the animal, while&#xD;
his spectacles, hat and wig flew off, and he went&#xD;
into a sand bank head foremost up to his chin.&#xD;
The poor gentleman struggled there with hands&#xD;
and feet very much like an adv~~irous swimmer&#xD;
who has gone out too far to sea, and who, in his&#xD;
mortal agony, is going down with his eyes, nose,&#xD;
ears and mouth full of water. I was the first to&#xD;
throw myself from my horse, and with the assis-&#xD;
tance of Captain Wilson, dragged the old gentle-&#xD;
man oot, and pot him upon his feet. The captain&#xD;
then turned to catch the horse, and I drew forth&#xD;
my handkerchief and wiped the sold gentleman's&#xD;
head and eyes, for he was yet blinded with the&#xD;
san&amp;amp;. though he did not appear to he hurt much.&#xD;

occupied towards each other. The old gentleman&#xD;

"There's a mistake," exclaimed Wilson at last,&#xD;
"this is not your son?"&#xD;
"~y cost no, sir, this is William Russell-the&#xD;
individual who has got my son into all his diffi-&#xD;
culties~-seduced him into the profanity of play&#xD;
aciing-.got him to disobey me and made me turn&#xD;
him out of my house-is now getting him to spend&#xD;

son?" he said, advancing towards me in a half&#xD;
angry, half beseeching tone.&#xD;
"Captain Wilson, then I am no longer your&#xD;
prisoner," I said.&#xD;
"No, sir," he replied, looking foolish.&#xD;
"Then, sir, I have my action of false imprison-&#xD;
ment against you, and you shall hear from me,&#xD;
sir," and I turned my ~ head towards Bla-&#xD;
densburg.&#xD;
"Stop, Mr. Russell," called out Horslcy, Sr.,&#xD;
"my son-for God's sake, sir-"&#xD;
"I don't know you, sir," I said to the old man,&#xD;
"I don't know you, sir-I won't say mend your&#xD;
morals, they are past mending; I merely say mend&#xD;
your manners, and if your son's slain, sir, do not&#xD;
flatter yourself with the idea that I did it. 'Shake&#xD;
not your gory locks at me,' old man; I say it not&#xD;
as it is said in the play, but I say it in truth,&#xD;
'shake not your gory locks at me,' but look home,&#xD;
and reflect that your harsh and unfatherly treat-&#xD;
ment of a sensitive and proud son, and more gifted&#xD;
than any man 1 know, has been the cas~e of all&#xD;
'this. 'Lay not the flattering unction' (I believe I&#xD;
quoted plays to the old man on purpose) 'to your&#xD;
soul,' old man, that it is anybody's fault but yours&#xD;
-you are reversing the position of old Lear, old&#xD;
boy, and teaching a child how 'sharper than&#xD;

mere outside-that it is a natural and not an ac-&#xD;
quired habit, caught at 'conventicle'-that it is in-&#xD;
grained and born of your cold, selfish and sordid&#xD;
nature. If it were not for the purity of his mother,&#xD;
whom he loved so much, and whom the late la-&#xD;
mented Mr. Beazely respected so much and talked&#xD;
of so often with over flowing eyes, I should be&#xD;
willing to swear that you were not his father. It&#xD;
is proper for rue now, sir, to inform you, if he has&#xD;
fallen in this duel, that he forgave you, and I do&#xD;
not tell it to you in any pity; I tell it to you by&#xD;

way of fulfilling the scripture, which you have so&#xD;
often misquoted, by quoting it aright and applying&#xD;
it aright. I do it, sir, to heap the living coals&#xD;

better put it on-get to your false covering again&#xD;
-you have shown your denuded head as you have&#xD;
shown a momentary spark of feeling for your son,&#xD;
very unexpectedly to yourself and much to the&#xD;
surprise of others. Get to your false covering&#xD;
again, or rather I should advise you, bare-headed&#xD;
and bare-hearted, and bad-hearted, (I liked that al-&#xD;
literation, and irave it effectively, emphasizing both&#xD;
the words 'bare,' and uprising in tone with a low-&#xD;
ering brow upon 'bad,') as you are, get down on&#xD;
your knees while it is to-day, for it will soon be&#xD;
night with you, old man, and pray God to give you&#xD;
grace to mend your conduct to your noble son."&#xD;
I certainly thought myself not only histrionic&#xD;
but decidedly oratorical, when I delivered this ex-&#xD;
temporaneous reproof and exhortation to Horslcy,&#xD;
Sr. It runs as glibly from my pen as I record it&#xD;
-I remember it so distinctly-as it came from my&#xD;
tongue when I pronounced it. I held through my&#xD;
kimboed left arm the loosened rein of my horse,&#xD;
whose head I had turned towards Bladensburg,&#xD;
when about to leave the party, and outstretched&#xD;
the other with my riding whip in hand, in a man-&#xD;
ner which. I confess, I took the hint of from what&#xD;
I h d rend of John Randolph and seen of him in&#xD;
the prints-a manner appropriate to a moral cas-&#xD;
tigation illustrated by the position of inflicting a&#xD;
physical one-and I made the very wavy point of&#xD;
that delicate riding whip tell on the old man. To&#xD;
say the truth I felt very much like obeying Ham-&#xD;
~ advice to the players, "suiting the action to&#xD;
the word," and I never felt before so truthfully the&#xD;
force of the Athenian's remark, when in answer to&#xD;
the question as to what constituted oratory, he re-&#xD;
plied, three things:&#xD;
"Action-Action-Action."&#xD;
Then Mark Antony's disclaimer over C~sar,&#xD;
that he, Antony, had&#xD;
"Neither wit nor worlds nor worth,&#xD;
Action nor utterance, nor the power or speech&#xD;
To stir men's blood,"&#xD;
occurred if) me, and 1 thought I had them even&#xD;
better than the Roman, and particularly the&#xD;
"power to stir men's blood," as I marked how&#xD;
&#xD;
WILLIAP&#xD;
well I made the very point-the delicate tracery of&#xD;
the tip end of my riding whip-illustrate the glori-&#xD;
ous action of oratory.&#xD;
We formed a tableau decidedly. 1 thought of&#xD;
it at the time. First, I was the chief figure on&#xD;
horseback, with the outstretched riding whip, ut-&#xD;
tering those&#xD;
"Thoughts that breathed and words that burned;"&#xD;
then old Horaley, wigless and speechless, staring&#xD;
at me, with the astonished negro at his side--&#xD;
then Captain Wilson looking at the old gentle-&#xD;
man as if he thought he deserved it-and Cap-&#xD;
tain Wilson's two attendants, who had all the&#xD;
day been mute, and who were mute still, but&#xD;
spectators of the graphic leading figures, and par-&#xD;
ticularly of the leading figure, myself.&#xD;
I paused awhile. The lonely road on which&#xD;
we stood, the dark back ground of woods, relieved&#xD;
by an opening to the left of a rudely ploughed&#xD;
field, with a small rural tenement at its edge, the&#xD;
morning sun flashing through dark clouds with a&#xD;
wandering and uncertain light, all combined to&#xD;
give effect to the scene. Thinks I to myself 1&#xD;
wish we had an audience here, such as one of&#xD;
the old Roman amphitheatre would have held-&#xD;
this is all lost. All at once through this reckless-&#xD;
ness of conduct, which had bitterness in it, never-&#xD;
theless, flashed wild and heart-piercing fears for&#xD;
my friend, aud without saying another word I&#xD;
put whip to my horse and (lashed towards Bla-&#xD;
densburg.&#xD;
"Halloa!" after a half minute's passe, I heard,&#xD;
Captain Wilson bawl out after me, "I've got a&#xD;
writ for you, too."&#xD;
Over my shoulder like Mazzeppa I threw back&#xD;
my defiance. I told the late party which had&#xD;
formed so interesting a tableau, that they might go&#xD;
to the devil, and renewed the application of my&#xD;
whip to my bounding steed.&#xD;
in another instant I heard them galloping after&#xD;
me. We had gotten four miles from Bladensburg,&#xD;
and therefore we had a four mile heat of it, and&#xD;
I had the start..&#xD;
"Well, if my steed holds out," thought I, "I'll&#xD;
be in Bladensburg time enough to warn Horeley to&#xD;
leave before they can reach him, for I reflected lie&#xD;
was probably there, unable as yet to get a second."&#xD;
&#xD;
~1 RUSSELL.&#xD;
&#xD;
71&#xD;
&#xD;
"Ha!" thought 1, as my good steed bounded&#xD;
ahead, "Bladensburg is famous for its races, but&#xD;
its most famous race was from it, not to it, ( I did&#xD;
not know then that I should write my memoirs) and&#xD;
here goes." Full of wild excitement I gave a&#xD;
whoop that would have done justice to a Texan&#xD;
ranger flying, but bravely, from a host of Mexi-&#xD;
cans, any two or three of whom he would more&#xD;
willingly have met than have eaten his breakfast,&#xD;
though he had had a long morning's ride without&#xD;
it. Captain Wilson echoed my shout after me in&#xD;
a tone that seemed to have real earnestness as well&#xD;
as fun in it, and I just then came to a bend in the&#xD;
road, which, after I turned, had a long stretch of&#xD;
level pathway before me, of which I was anxious&#xD;
to avail myself while out of sight of my pursuers.&#xD;
The consciousness of being unseen made me think&#xD;
that I could go ahead the faster, while I felt if&#xD;
they should turn the bend and find that I had&#xD;
gained on them they would give over the pursuit,&#xD;
I had in fact nobody to fear but Wilson, and I felt&#xD;
with a writ in his pocket and the law to back him&#xD;
he was an individual towards whom discretion,&#xD;
which would be another word for surrender, would&#xD;
be the better part of valor.&#xD;
In another moment I heard a wild yell from&#xD;
Captain Wilson, (and I thought how well he gave&#xD;
it,) behind me, and I looked anxiously over my&#xD;
shoulder to see if I had gained en him. I had&#xD;
evidently. How this inspired me. I arose in my&#xD;
stirrups and felt the safety and the swiftness of&#xD;
my steed with a gladness that made me pat his&#xD;
neck gently with my hand instead of applying my&#xD;
whip to his flaming flank. How cleanly, if I may&#xD;
so speak, he threw the dirt from his clattering&#xD;
hoofs.&#xD;
"There was racing and chasing onCannobie lea,"&#xD;
I said to myself. Hurra for the Bladensburg&#xD;
races redivivus.&#xD;
"They'll have fleet steeds that follow,"&#xD;
was the cry that day, and how craven fear made&#xD;
the cowards scamper, but 1 go it bravely. I'll&#xD;
meet yoo yet, Sir Thomas .Johnstone and Captain&#xD;
Merryman. Perchance l'll exchange a shot or&#xD;
two with you myself~&#xD;

72                         THE ATJTOB]&#xD;
I felt like riding through Bladensburg as Dick&#xD;
Turpin rode through the English village, with the&#xD;
reins in my mouth and a pistol in each hand. "Go&#xD;
K         it my old fellow," said Ito my horse, "and if you&#xD;
take me through, though I cannot make you Con-&#xD;
sul, as the Roman made his steed, yet your stall&#xD;
shall have an abundant rack and a luxuriant trough,&#xD;
arid you shall have a wide pasture~for your range,&#xD;
and no one shall put saddle or briole on you except&#xD;
on a gala day, when I bestride you to escort a lady&#xD;
or play soldiers, when bright eyes look on.&#xD;
"Ha! the- turnpike gates flew open for John&#xD;
Gilpin; they don't fly open in this country for fly-&#xD;
ing men, and therefore j~~5 lucky there are no gates&#xD;
between me and the city of the races. I wish&#xD;
there had been a broader turnpike than that of the&#xD;
(leep shatne which they made so light of when&#xD;
they broke all bounds-thbse racers of Bladens&#xD;
burg. I wish there had been some high wall that&#xD;
had held them to the slaughtering as they fled as&#xD;
they did, that they might have been slain in the&#xD;
ditch, and then, though they would have died as&#xD;
inglorious as was their flight, history might have&#xD;
been apocryphal on the matter, and they might&#xD;
have won another name than that of craven. Like&#xD;
the wife whose fidelity the husband doubts not,&#xD;
though circumstances look, awry, yet she is bol&#xD;
steered up by the fact that she is trusted by the one I&#xD;
most concerned in her being true. Othello would&#xD;
have been 'happy,' so he says, if he had 'nothing&#xD;
known'-aIaS all's known-and in the very shadow&#xD;
of Mount Vernon the rascals ran and betrayed the&#xD;
capital, though bearing the name of him whose&#xD;
ashes repose so near it. Why did not the sleeper&#xD;
arise like Samuel to Saul, 'an old i~an covered&#xD;
with his mantle,' and rebuke them. But they&#xD;
won the race. I wonder shall I win this race of&#xD;
Bladensburg."&#xD;
With this change of thought to the pressing pre-&#xD;
sent frorti the past, I s~ fixed myself on my sad-&#xD;
dIe as to look around without abating the speed of&#xD;
roy horse, and truly, except that the numbers&#xD;
were less, I fancy that pursuers aid pursued looked&#xD;
very much like tire Bladensburg racers.&#xD;
Captain Wilson was decidedly ahead, and h~&#xD;
urge'1 on his steel gallantly. Behind him were&#xD;
his two ~flicial' si~le by side, and [thought lanolin.&#xD;

especially the latter. For there was old Horaley&#xD;
remounted and trying to hold in hiro steed, that&#xD;
had more bottom than either of the other horses,&#xD;
while his black man was spurring up to keep his&#xD;
~ company.&#xD;
I so shook with laughter that I could scarcely&#xD;
keep my seat. I thought Elorslcy, Sr., must look&#xD;
something like John (iilpin. I wanted to have a&#xD;
near view of him and see how he looked when I&#xD;
thought of the lines-&#xD;
"Away went Gilpin, and away&#xD;
Went Gilpin's hat and wig."&#xD;
"The Iblks at Bladenshuig," I said aloud, in&#xD;
lnmmny colloquy with myself, "will be as much sur-&#xD;
prised as were the Ibiks along the road that Gil-&#xD;
phin scared up. Zounds, it it were midnight&#xD;
now-&#xD;
"Tramp, tramp, along the sand they rode,&#xD;
Splash, splash, along the sea,"&#xD;
as we went it through the burg illustrious in the&#xD;
history of races, they might take us for the ghosts&#xD;
of those citizen soldiers, who 'ran away' and&#xD;
'lived,' but not 'to fight another day,' who were&#xD;
buried among their kindred, but as it might be sup-&#xD;
posed doomed to the purgatory of an occasional&#xD;
ride over the course where their living flesh did so&#xD;
outrage manhood."&#xD;
"stop, I tell you," shouted Captain Wilson&#xD;
when he saw me looking back at them.&#xD;
I thought of the old soldier's remark when he&#xD;
was ordered by the foe to surrender his arms, and&#xD;
who replied, "come an(1 take them," and I bel-&#xD;
lowed back-&#xD;
"Catch me."&#xD;
"Shoot him down," shouted out Horsley, in I&#xD;
screaming tone that struck distinctly on my ear.&#xD;
1 could not but think of his christian spirit as I&#xD;
turned my back again to the foe to put my steed to&#xD;
his mettle, when lo! I found myself in the out-&#xD;
skirts, (if outskirts it might be called) of Bladens-&#xD;
burg, the winner of the race, thouiih not by many&#xD;
lengths, and f-ill in view ot the Bladensburg hotel,&#xD;
at which, at that very moment, I saw the carriage&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
SCENE IN THE BLADENSBHRG IIOTEL'-MY iNTERVIEW&#xD;
WITH HOUSLEY, JR.-CAPTAIN IIERRYMAN 'S RATiD DE-&#xD;
SCENT OF THE STAIR CASE-TWO MEN SHOT WITHOUT&#xD;
A DUEL-PERCHANCE THE ItIOlIT ONES-OLD HORSLEY&#xD;
REVOKES HIS WILL&#xD;
I resolved at once what I was to do. Dashing&#xD;
up to the carriage, I flung myself from my horse,&#xD;
throwing the bridle to the hackman, who was obse-&#xD;
quiously awaiting with open door the descent of&#xD;
Johostone and his friend. I sprang past them into&#xD;
the bar room and asked where Horsley was?&#xD;
"Not up yet, sir," was the reply of the bar&#xD;
keeper.&#xD;
I darted up stairs and found him getting up,&#xD;
awakened, as he afterwards told me, by the clatter&#xD;
of my horse's hoofs. In an instant I explained to&#xD;
him the state of affairs.&#xD;
"I must be off," said he, "that fellow, Merry-&#xD;
man, would say, should I be arrested, that I had&#xD;
time to dodge and didn't, and then I'd have to&#xD;
challenge him. And to tell you the truth, Russell,"&#xD;
he continued, as he drew on his boots, "I would&#xD;
rather that Johnstone should have two shots at me&#xD;
than that Merryman should have one. Ha, I hear&#xD;
tl~em on the steps; well, I'll through this door,"&#xD;
hE~ continued, turning to one which evidently let&#xD;
into another room, "though it opened into my lady's&#xD;
chamber."&#xD;
As he opened the door I passed out into the entry&#xD;
and there met Captain Merryman.&#xD;
The captain's manner was cautious, profoundly&#xD;
so; cool as possible, cool to insolence, which was&#xD;
sharpened by the very slightest shadow of a smile,&#xD;
which played about his eye among the crow feet,&#xD;
and looked as devilish as a brutal, bloody and&#xD;
brandy lighted eye well could.&#xD;
"They've found out their mistake, Mr. Russell,&#xD;
so ~Oll had better adrn9nish Mr. Horslcy to save&#xD;
himself from arrest by escape, or it will all end in&#xD;
child's play, and we've had enough of it already.&#xD;
I arc told that the yonng gentleman~~ father is on&#xD;
&#xD;
of angry blood in me, but I determined to imitate&#xD;
the captains coolness as I replied:&#xD;
"Yes, captain, I never learned but that Mr.&#xD;
1-lorslcy had these virtues, and I consider him&#xD;
equal to any gentleman, wears he the button or&#xD;
not, who has the reputation of having most of the&#xD;
vices."&#xD;
"Sir, I never dodge an insult. I am not like the&#xD;
Frenchman, sir, who, when a thing is said to him&#xD;
of doubtful import, takes the buttered side."&#xD;
"There is no buttered side that I know of in&#xD;
what I said," I replied scornfully.&#xD;
"None to me, sir, at least. We understand&#xD;
I each other, Mr. Russell. Dr. Clark, I have heard&#xD;
my pious mother say-was it not Dr. Clark, Sir?&#xD;
-Dr. Adam Clark"-I looked at him without&#xD;
saying a word-"You don't recollect-yes, it was&#xD;
Dr. Adam Clark-he used to say that a man could&#xD;
not have too many irons in the fire at once-doubt-&#xD;
ful that-but, sir, understand: my shooting irons&#xD;
are always ready on such an oc~asionZyon under-&#xD;
stand, sir-mum's the word. I trust Mr. Horslcy&#xD;
has made his escape-he is a gentleman of small&#xD;
proportions, and our landlady here is a large wo~inan;&#xD;
ho could easily hide under her petticoats, ~'hich I&#xD;
dare say she will let him do, when I assure her he&#xD;
is quite harmless- though that position might not&#xD;
quite suit his own notions."&#xD;
[looked hard at the captain again, and my first&#xD;
reflection was that as I had gotten into a difficulty&#xD;
with him at any rate, the best thing I could do&#xD;
would be to pitch him down stairs. We are ph~r-&#xD;
siognomnists of the passions, though the quieter&#xD;
emotions maybe are often misunderstood. Their&#xD;
lines are not so legible. My angry stare put the'&#xD;
captain on his guard, for he placed himself 1n an&#xD;
attitude of defence. Thin (is it strange?) fixed my&#xD;
purpose, and with my clenched fists I struck him&#xD;
as he stood on the edge of the stair way, with my&#xD;
whole strength, and over lie went, raking an in--&#xD;
effectual grasp at the railing as he fell. He, how-&#xD;
ever, struck the banister in his fall, which broke&#xD;

THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF&#xD;
&#xD;
might say black. I stood at the head of the stairs&#xD;
without moving, and saw* the gallant captain&#xD;
launched into the bar room, just as he has seen&#xD;
many a gallant vessel giveti to the deep-both&#xD;
launched into their native elements.&#xD;
"Thunder!" exclaimed Captain Wilson, who&#xD;
was standing in conversation with the bar keeper&#xD;
below, "what's out now?" And as he spoke Cap-&#xD;
tain Merryman tumbled at his feet. Wilson, im-&#xD;
mediately ran to his assistance, and lifted him up&#xD;
as I descended the steps into the bar room. Cap-&#xD;
tain Merryman was not apparently the least hurt.&#xD;
but he was evidently choked with rage and blind&#xD;
with passion. He shook himself free from Wilson,&#xD;
which, however, he could not have done easily had&#xD;
the former been disposed to hold him, and he&#xD;
stamped about the room in an effort' to catch his&#xD;
breath and see distinctlyy.&#xD;
As [glanced fiom the stamping captain round&#xD;
the room, there was Wilson's two silent attendants&#xD;
apart in the window, while old [lorslcy, with his&#xD;
black attendant behind him, was gazing intently at&#xD;
the captain.&#xD;
"What's the matter'?"&#xD;
"I knocked him down stairs," I said.&#xD;
When a child gives the string which controls&#xD;
he limbs of his move able man-toy a jerk, at once&#xD;
up goes its arms and out goes its legs, and so went&#xD;
old Horsley's as he bent his body down and threw&#xD;
his arms up oyer his head, shuddering all over as&#xD;
he muttered with white lips:&#xD;
"Murder."&#xD;
"Not exactly murder," said Captain Merry-&#xD;
man, who had now come to himself, and whose&#xD;
coolness, so suddenly resumed, was remarkable,&#xD;
"not exactly murder, but merely an attempt at it,"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Get out of the way, Mr. Constable, I corn-&#xD;
mand you; sir. It is no use to remonstrate or to.&#xD;
command the pea~e," exclaimed Captain Merry-'&#xD;
man, changing his position so as to get a fire at&#xD;
me,.while I stood stock still, though I must con-&#xD;
fess I was glad to be sheltered by the broad chest&#xD;
of Captain Wilson.&#xD;
"Look here, I tell you," said Wilson, "I have&#xD;
seen a thousand such fusses as these. If you 'm~ist&#xD;
fight let's have it fair, I've got a pair of pistols."&#xD;
"You're a pretty officer of the law to iii-&#xD;
stigat'- a duel. No, that individual is without the&#xD;
pale of honorable warfare. 1 consider him an as-&#xD;
sasin and he must suffer as such. Get out ot the&#xD;
way sir, or 'you may catch it yourself."&#xD;
"Look here," said Captain Wilson, producing a&#xD;
stout pistol from away in next to his skin, as I&#xD;
thought, "here's 'Polly my darling,' and you've&#xD;
my word for it, and I never break my word, if&#xD;
you shoot the young tuan I'll shoot you.~~&#xD;
In the act of getting out his pistol, Captaiti Wil-&#xD;
son exposed part of my person to the aim of Cap-&#xD;
tain Merryman, who took advantage of it and pull-&#xD;
ed the trigger. I saw that his aim was upon me&#xD;
in a mortal manner, but his pistol snapped, or in all&#xD;
human probability I should not be writing this.&#xD;
Quick as thought, Captain Merryman cocked his&#xD;
pistol again and pointed at me.&#xD;
"This is fooling," exclaimed Captain Wilson,&#xD;
enraged, and before even I was aware of his in-&#xD;
tention, so quick was his sight and so keen was&#xD;
his aitn, he discharged his weapon. Captain&#xD;
Merryman started at the shot and as his broken&#xD;
right arm fell at his side, his pistol went off and one&#xD;
long howl of "murder" from old Horsley directed&#xD;
our attention to that gentleman, who was prostrated&#xD;
&#xD;
and he put his hand in his breast and drew out a on the floor, and the same moment Johostone en-&#xD;
pocket pistol, "in such murderous assaults as this tered and lifted him up.&#xD;
tt is proper that a gentleman should take the law I looked towards C~'ptain Merryman to see what&#xD;

I seized up a chair as well as I might to defend agony, the expression of which he was trying to&#xD;

asked:                                         child.  I stepped to Mr. Horslcy's side, ~.. d as&#xD;
"What are you going to do, sir?" sister by Johnstone and the bar keeper, we placed&#xD;
"Shdot the scoundrel." ' him on the sofa.&#xD;
"Shoot-you shan't shoot here, sir. 1 am an "Are you hurt much, Mr. Horslcy?" I asked.&#xD;
officer of the law, sir; I command the peace."  "Here, sir, here," said he, putting his hand to&#xD;
&#xD;
WILLIAM RUSSELL.&#xD;
&#xD;
his side. "This is downright murder-Lord be&#xD;
mez~iful to me."&#xD;
We stripped off his ciat and vest, and his bloody&#xD;
shirt betrayed the fact that he was indeed wound-&#xD;
'ed and I feared* mortally. Everything was xjn-&#xD;
fusion.&#xD;
"Gentlemen," said Captain Wilson, "listen to&#xD;
me."&#xD;
All were still, flow a commanding spirit will&#xD;
exhibit itself in an emergency.&#xD;
"Have you a doctor in the burg'?" Captain&#xD;
Wilson asked.&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Then go for him." Turning to his mute at-&#xD;
tendants he said, "Mr. Munson and friend Pettit,&#xD;
start at once for Washington and bring doctors&#xD;
here. You had better get fresh horses."&#xD;
'"I'll go," said the hackman, "and bring them&#xD;
out if you'll pay me."&#xD;
"I'll ride in the hack," said Captain Merry-.&#xD;
man, "bar keeper, mix me a glass of brandy and&#xD;
water. Who are you and what are you?" said he,&#xD;
addressing himself to Captain Wilson.&#xD;
"There's no time to talk about that, sir-no&#xD;
time. I'm responsible both to you and the law.&#xD;
*B~~t I tell you what it is, I don't want you to die&#xD;
before your time. You had better let that liquor&#xD;
alone-you live too high now--that liquor will&#xD;
inflame' your blood. Your arm's broke, I see, and&#xD;
the present state you are in will make it go hard&#xD;
with you; you may lose your arm, perhaps your&#xD;
life. I'm familiar with wounds, stranger."&#xD;
What a horrible expression of despair and hate&#xD;
passed over Captain Merryman~s countenance,&#xD;
though' h~ said nothing; while in the silence,&#xD;
which for a moment occurred, old llorsley ejacu-&#xD;
lated:&#xD;
"Send for a 'dozen doctors, gentlemen-I'll pay&#xD;
the expertise. 0 Lord! be merciful-this is tnur-&#xD;
dcr-a little Water-a little drop of water." I&#xD;
turned to 'him and found he had fainted away.&#xD;
Captain Merryman seemed, after a moment's re-&#xD;
flection, to consider the advice of Captain Wilson&#xD;
as .the best he could take in the premises, and&#xD;
while some were assisting him off with his coat,&#xD;
others of us were attending to Mr. Horslcy, while&#xD;
all were impatiently awaiting the arrivalot the&#xD;
doctor of Bladensburg~ whose residence we were&#xD;
&#xD;
13&#xD;
&#xD;
informed was not far off, and who'at that early&#xD;
hour of the morning had not probably gone out.&#xD;
Before noon we had six doctors from Wasnington&#xD;
and three from Bladensburg, in attendance on the&#xD;
wounded men. Captain Merryman's arm was set,&#xD;
but he was suffering in his room alone, for John-&#xD;
stone had gone to Washington for the physicians,&#xD;
but had not returned with them. The wound of&#xD;
Mr. Horslcy was cot as bad as was at first&#xD;
anticipated. The bullet 'had struck a rib, and&#xD;
as. is frequently the case, passed around the&#xD;
body and was extracted from his back. He wa~&#xD;
pronounced out of all danger, taken up stairs and&#xD;
comfortably lodged in bed, and I could not but&#xD;
give l~m my attendance, for though I had 'not the&#xD;
least respect for himself, knowing the manner in&#xD;
which he had treated his son, yet I could not but&#xD;
sympathize with his sufferings and rc~pect hts age.&#xD;
By way of satisfying the old gentleman of his&#xD;
son's proper conduct, for to do him justice he was&#xD;
greatly distressed upon the subject, I gave him a&#xD;
full account of the whole affair of the duel, saying&#xD;
nothing about myself but when I could not help&#xD;
it, and doing all I could to soften away his asperi-&#xD;
ties towards his son.&#xD;
"Yes, yes, Mr. Russell, I want you to get me a&#xD;
pen and paper. I had been so outraged, sir, by&#xD;
Samuel's conduct, that I had left all my property&#xD;
to an asylum for destitute children, and, for fear of&#xD;
a turn-you don't think there's any fear, though?~~&#xD;
"No, sir, the doctors think not."&#xD;
"Ab, my young friend, but they're uncertain.&#xD;
Holy Providence, how suddenly my old clerk,&#xD;
that respectable but I must say wilful man, the,&#xD;
late lamented Mr. Beazely, how suddenly he was&#xD;
called off-for fear of a turn I'll right things at once.&#xD;
Let me be propped up in bed, I will write immedi-&#xD;
ately to Balttmore and have my will destroyed.&#xD;
My mind misgave me about disinheriting Sammy,&#xD;
when I thought myself in a mortal condition, but I&#xD;
must say it would have been much better if Mr.&#xD;
Beazely had left his property to me, I should then&#xD;
have had much more control over him. He would&#xD;
not have broken loose in this way."&#xD;
Fearful that the old gentleman's situation might&#xD;
take a "turn," as he was pleased to express it,&#xD;
whereby my friend, had it proved fatal, would&#xD;
have lost what was justly his inheritance, I propped&#xD;

father, and where I met both him and Johustone&#xD;
in a proper mood for a reconciliation after what&#xD;
had occurred. I found iorsley in disguise, with&#xD;
a big pair of false whiskers on, in an old grocery&#xD;
eway over by the Potomac bridge. I held a long&#xD;
conversation with him before I found out who he&#xD;
was.&#xD;
Captain Merryman was the greatest sufferer.&#xD;
His arm threatened mortifi~ation, and he was com-&#xD;
pelled to have it amputated. It did one good thing&#xD;
though, it put him on the temperance list, lie,&#xD;
however, cut the whole party of us, though he&#xD;
remained true to his ruling passion, for I under-&#xD;
stood that he had learned to fire with his left&#xD;
hand, and had become as good a shot with it as he&#xD;
had been with his right. I could not but think&#xD;
e~Y now and then, when the Bladensburg scene&#xD;

quireme'ii~of such consummate skill with his left&#xD;
hand had soipething to do with the future in my&#xD;
history, (at lea§lin the intention of Captain Mer&#xD;

such circumstances, of&amp;amp;~n startled me into anger or&#xD;
gloom, ahd when I thou~t of Peters6n and Alice,&#xD;
combined them with n~ ~nialL admixture in a&#xD;
way which was not likely to improve my way of&#xD;
life.&#xD;
&#xD;
BIOGRAPHY OF&#xD;
&#xD;
My readers are perchance surprised that I have&#xD;
said nothing of my parents since I left Charleston.&#xD;
In fact I scarcely ever thought of them in the stir-&#xD;
ring scenes whicir I am recording. I certainly&#xD;
thought more of my Aunt Betsy than either of&#xD;
them, if I except at times the inexpressible feel-&#xD;
ings of tenderness which came over me when I&#xD;
thought of my mother, and of her last farewell.&#xD;
Parents who wish to retain the affections of&#xD;
their children should not send them away from&#xD;
the parental roof, particularly when it becomes&#xD;
but the light of a distant memory (if I may use&#xD;
the expression) which lessens every day. No,&#xD;
we are such creatures of habit that we fall into the&#xD;
habit of thinking about and loving those with&#xD;
whom we are associated, particularly if they have&#xD;
authority over us and treat us kindly, and out of&#xD;
the habit of regarding the ties of nature; in fact,&#xD;
as the proverb goes, the habit makes the second&#xD;
attire.&#xD;
My parents had written periodically to me ever&#xD;
since my childhood, my mother expressing a great&#xD;
deal of affection for me, at which I began to wonder,&#xD;
and they were always telling me how much I&#xD;
ought to love "Aunt Betsy," which I certainty&#xD;
felt to be a fact wheneverthe old lady petted me.&#xD;
'and which I quarreled with myself 1~r feeling&#xD;
whenever she refused to pet me, or crossed me in&#xD;
any way. L was twice arranged that I should go&#xD;
to Charleston and see m~ l)arents, but then when&#xD;
I was young I could not go without my aunt Betsy.&#xD;
for she would not l~et me leave her sight, arid she&#xD;
had terrors of another sea voyage not to be over-&#xD;
come, and her fear of land travel, (not then what&#xD;
it is now) was immoderate; so that I entered&#xD;
manhood and did not go to see my parents. Some-&#xD;
times, too, my mother would write that she was&#xD;
coming on to see us~ but then my father, whose&#xD;
health was failing, was loth to move abopt much,&#xD;
and my mother would not leave him, and in the&#xD;
meantime these visits were often spoken of and&#xD;
arranged, but were not made by either party.&#xD;
And thus and thus we go through life.&#xD;
The truth is, that my father had a notion that&#xD;
1 'vas getting ott better with my aunt than I po~si&#xD;
bly could with my mother. He always fancied,&#xD;
so I learned from aunt Betsy, that my mother&#xD;
would indulge m~ ever much. This in fact is&#xD;
&#xD;
what my good aunt did her best to impress upon E&#xD;
him herself, she holding the opinion, I suspect, I&#xD;
that she was sometimes rather too rigid with me.&#xD;
This I felt was the fact ever since the Sunday&#xD;
suit matter in the Peterson affair. But when my&#xD;
iunt was struck with this notion of her severity it&#xD;
was marvellous how she would relax her discip-&#xD;
line, or rather how her indulgence would not only&#xD;
become indiscriminate but lavish. And I used&#xD;
often to think to myself if the world were my aunt&#xD;
Betsy, that is, if things in particular and things&#xD;
in general in this world, were like my aunt Betsy~&#xD;
how I would "come ~&#xD;
No! parents who wish their children to love&#xD;
them, should leara them that love; that is, should&#xD;
keep their children by their side and let them feel&#xD;
their childish dependence upon parental cate. But&#xD;
enough of this. It maybe all hollow apology for&#xD;
myself.&#xD;
But I commenced this chapter by saying it was&#xD;
a bright day in Washington. Quite a flattering&#xD;
account of our intended duel and the circumstances&#xD;
pertaining titereto, had gotten into the papers, and&#xD;
our Bladensburg race was told by the letter writers&#xD;
in a much more graphic manner than I have given&#xD;
it, from the fact that I confined myself to the&#xD;
truth. If our names had not been given I should&#xD;
not have known myself in the affair at all; I figured&#xD;
so heroically, as taking the responsibility of life&#xD;
and limb in the place of my friend, while Horsicy&#xD;
figured aslargely, and quite an unique account of his&#xD;
character and oddities was given by the leading&#xD;
correspondent of a New York paper, which was&#xD;
written so well as to attract universal attention,&#xD;
and to he generally copied throughout the whole&#xD;
union.&#xD;
Even the dignified and most courteous as well&#xD;
as most able editor of the National Intelligencer,&#xD;
(it would be well for the land if there were more&#xD;
like him at the helm of the press) gave it place, as&#xD;
he said, for the exquisite skill at narration which the&#xD;
writer, who, the editor asserted, would not be long&#xD;
unknown to fame if he wrote much, had exhibited,&#xD;
as well as for the strange, and as far as Captain&#xD;
Wilson and Mr. Horsley, Sr., were concerned,&#xD;
sad manner in which the affair ended. Horsley&#xD;
and I became distinguishedd" characters.&#xD;
This was just at the time when the nullification&#xD;
&#xD;
'15&#xD;
&#xD;
lazonry was coming up in Congress, a matter that&#xD;
had not thought about, for all I cared for politics&#xD;
was the politics of the green room of the IJollid~y&#xD;
street Theatre and our own little Thespian corps,&#xD;
md, it made the Southern men, and particularly&#xD;
he South Carolinians, "cotton" to me in a way&#xD;
hat made rue a great favorite among them, when&#xD;
hey came to know who I was. And this cordial-&#xD;
ty on their part was increased from the fact that&#xD;
ferrymann at a public dinner had drank a drunken&#xD;
oast in opposition to the palmetto state. There&#xD;
were fire caters in Congress in those days, and they&#xD;
rentedd me, a Southern youth from the Monumen.&#xD;
tal city, with an all hail that was certainly grati-&#xD;
fying, gentle reader, to your autobiographer, though&#xD;
it certainly gave my phrenological development&#xD;
of self-esteem more sail than ballast. I could not,&#xD;
however, but wish (seing how the affair ended,)&#xD;
that I had boldly stepped out from behind Captain&#xD;
Wilson and defied Captain Merryman to fire, and&#xD;
I rejoiced exceedingly that that part of my adven-&#xD;
ture was not chronicled. On the contrary, I was&#xD;
represented as advancing with uplifted chair on&#xD;
the cocked pistol of Captain Merryman, whose life&#xD;
was saved by the breaking of his arm from the fire&#xD;
of a friend ol' mine who stood by, the account&#xD;
stated, for had it not been for that fact, "Mr. L~tis-&#xD;
sell would certainly have brained the gallant&#xD;
captain with the chair." I certainly blushed a&#xD;
kind of sneaking blush, when I read this in the&#xD;
privacy of my own room, but unless my reader&#xD;
has been similarly situated, he can have no idea&#xD;
what a face I put on in public, making that very&#xD;
blush seem an effusion of youthful and native&#xD;
modesty, as though I had periled my life without&#xD;
thinking any body saw me, as the man of Ross&#xD;
"Did good by stealth and blushed to find it fame."&#xD;
Again, I repeat, it was a bright day in Washing-&#xD;
ton. It was not only bright in itself, but it was&#xD;
bright because I was bright, and there's the rub.&#xD;
The bright and the dark day is more in our feel-&#xD;
ings than anywhere else, as Hamlet, in his moody&#xD;
fit, well shows. That was a dark day to Cassius,&#xD;
certainly not exactly a dull one to his designing&#xD;
and active spirit, when he told Brutus that&#xD;
"This world, was made for CHsar,"&#xD;
no matter how brilliantly the sunlight looked forth&#xD;

&#xD;
aspirator aud called himself a devoted patriot, though&#xD;
the natural world might be decidedly cloudy. Did&#xD;
not Mark Antony feel that "the world was made"&#xD;
for Cmsar's successors, but alas! he met with the&#xD;
Egyptian witch. But Horsley and I did certainly&#xD;
enjoy that bright day in Washington, as we strolled&#xD;
arm in arm down the sunny side of Pennsylvania&#xD;
Avenue, and did the Washington public, a very&#xD;
motley public, the honor of gratifying their desire&#xD;
to see us, and our own to see them- they having&#xD;
the most for theii penny, I thought, and so I told&#xD;
Horeley.&#xD;
"Ha, ha," and he laughed heartily in his own&#xD;
peculiar way, but his brow saddened as he said,&#xD;
"but, Russell, 1 am sorry for Merryman."&#xD;
"It's more than I am," I replied. "Why, 'old&#xD;
floss,' he's practising the duello with his left hand,&#xD;
and has gotten to be as perfect with it as he was&#xD;
with his right-he has designs on me certainly-&#xD;
and I tell you what it is, I'll have to go to the pistol&#xD;
gallery and keep myself in constant practice, for&#xD;
I am certain that he'll send me an invitation some&#xD;
of these days, and I can tell you it's no joke to&#xD;
have a fellow pointing a pistol at you with the&#xD;
mortal aim of Captain Merryman."&#xD;
I left Horaley to conclude that there I stood&#xD;
breasting this same mortal aim with no intervening&#xD;
chair and no protecting Captain Wilson.&#xD;
"Fact," replied Horsley, "when a man in cold&#xD;
blood looks over these matters, he wonders how&#xD;
he could do such things in the sight of God; we all&#xD;
understand that he can't well do anything else in&#xD;
the sight of rnan-lut I really, old acquaintances as&#xD;
we were, felt so indignant towards Johnstone for&#xD;
his pertinacity, that though I had resolved not to&#xD;
shoot at him, I don't kn6w but what, when we got&#xD;
on the ground, I would have shot, nevertheless, if&#xD;
I had seen him pointing at me with a deadly aim&#xD;
and revengeful eye."&#xD;
"I tell you what it is, 'old floss,' 1 am out of&#xD;
funds-now's my time with my good aunt, she&#xD;
thinks I'm here learning statesmanship, and making&#xD;
myself popular with the distinguished sons (if my&#xD;

cation means. You must goto Baltimore for me,&#xD;
see her and set forth my need and the expendi-&#xD;
&#xD;
"flow much do you want?"&#xD;
"Why, I want four or five hundred dollars; be&#xD;
particular to impress upon the old lady that I&#xD;
never play cards-state to her, 'old floss,' that it&#xD;
is a singular fact that whenever 1 see a card I ana&#xD;
seized with such a moral revulsion that my physi-&#xD;
cal man gives way, and I have quite a spell of&#xD;
"It would be well if I could say as much for you&#xD;
on your seeing a bottle of wine-but there your&#xD;
appetite grows by what it feeds on."&#xD;
"That's natural-all artificial excitements grow&#xD;
by their use-a child eats a piece of bread to-day&#xD;
and don't want a larger piece to-morrow, but a boy&#xD;
who is made sick when he first smokes or chews or&#xD;
drinks, in his determination to be a man, soon ac-&#xD;
quires such an appetite for the segar, quid or dram,&#xD;
that he is wretched without it, and he continues to&#xD;
devote himself to its use with a growing propensity&#xD;
until he becomes a victim, especially the devotee&#xD;
of the dram."&#xD;
Ah, it was a beautiful afternoon in Washing-&#xD;
ton. The crowded avenue was full of gaily dress-&#xD;
ed people, and though it was now winter, the air&#xD;
was spring-like and delicious, and except the leaf-&#xD;
less trees ~n the avenue, there was nothing to de-&#xD;
note that spring was not upon us. The golden sun&#xD;
hid his broad disk, as John Randolph would say,&#xD;
behind the Virginia hills, and threw his parting&#xD;
rays on the dome of the capitol, and all was gaiety&#xD;
and gladness (at least to the eye) with the crowd&#xD;
of well dressed and distinguished people, who&#xD;
thronged the avenue.&#xD;
"Ha, ha" laughed Horsley, with that quizical,&#xD;
peculiar, knowing laugh of his, "it was Jeines,&#xD;
whose conscience smote him, and he went straight,&#xD;
when he reflected upon the fire eating propensities&#xD;
of Captain Merryman and my innocence of any&#xD;
experience, to say nothing of my courage in the&#xD;
matter, and blew the affair to the old gentleman.&#xD;
The old gentleman shoWed more affection for me&#xD;
thati I thought he would; he was very kind to rue&#xD;
in his confinement to his room."&#xD;
"So 1w diould have been."&#xD;
Horsley looked at me.&#xD;
"The fact is, Horsley, that I have been brought&#xD;
&#xD;
up away from my parents, and therefore I think&#xD;
that as we are not consulted in the matter of our&#xD;
coming into this breathing world, that those who&#xD;
place us here are at least bound to take care of us&#xD;
until we can take care of ourselves, and if any&#xD;
peculiar rash passion attaches to our clay because&#xD;
of kinship, those who gave it to us ought to suffer&#xD;
it in our own persons, inasmuch as they bear with&#xD;
it in their own."&#xD;
"Well, I don't know," said Horsley, musingly.&#xD;
"This Captain Wilson," I said, "I have new&#xD;
seen him since. I described the captain of the&#xD;
city watch here to a friend, and he is just the op-&#xD;
posite in personal description to the one who ar-&#xD;
rested me according to him. You would'nt like to&#xD;
ask your father about it?"&#xD;
"Well, indeed I would'ut. lie ha~ been very&#xD;
kind to me."&#xD;
"You owe it to me," said I to Horslcy, stopping&#xD;
him and facing him on the corner. "I am satisfied&#xD;
that I have oratorical as well as histrionic talent.&#xD;
I say nothing of the scene between the old gentle&#xD;
man and myself at the Bladensburg races, though&#xD;
as orator Phillips says of the character of Napo-&#xD;
leon, it was 'grand, gloomy and peculiar,' but&#xD;
when your governor was lying stretched out there&#xD;
at Bladensburg with that bullet in his side and his&#xD;
fears for his life fiercely wrought upon, I read the&#xD;
good book to him; I tell you, with emotion. It's&#xD;
lucky for you I am a good reader; 1 made every&#xD;
word tell-every word-one particularly -l watch-&#xD;
ed the process-he was uncommonly down-hearted&#xD;
and he felt himself to be a sinner, for he kept&#xD;
making the remark to himself, not aware that I&#xD;
overheard him, and I introduced the subject of&#xD;
your last message to him when you had that pro-&#xD;
found presentiment that you were to be shot in the&#xD;
morning. Well, I gave it the greatest effect; if&#xD;
the reading told on old loss, Sr., there is no tell-&#xD;
ing what my manner of narrating your message&#xD;
had on him. I tell you, sir. I drew copious tears&#xD;
fiom the old gentleman, and what's more, I dr~w~&#xD;
tears from myself, and made him draw up a revo-&#xD;
cation of his will-why the old gentleman told me&#xD;
he was worth two hundred thousand dollars, that&#xD;
he was about endowing destitute children, as much&#xD;
&#xD;
77&#xD;
&#xD;
only tears from my aunt in describing my friend-&#xD;
ship for you, my valor, and my popularity here,&#xD;
but, "old loss," you must draw five hundred do!-&#xD;
lars at least from her pocket.i~&#xD;
"Well, I'll take the stage to-morrow."&#xD;
"Certainly, I have sent, franked by Calhoun&#xD;
himself, the papers containing the last Bladensburg&#xD;
races to my dear good aunt, and you must be sure&#xD;
and let her know that Calhoun sent them out of&#xD;
respect for her. You must furthermore let her&#xD;
know he means to mention her in his memoirs as&#xD;
the paragon of aunts, as I shall rank as the paragon&#xD;
of nephews. Horsicy, if I were in your place and'&#xD;
you in mine, I believe I could get five thousand&#xD;
dollars for you."&#xD;
"Well, there's one thing you may be assured&#xD;
of."&#xD;
~6 .AThat's that?"&#xD;
"Why, if I had the power to get five thousand&#xD;
dollars for you I would not, for you are certainly&#xD;
going it rather strong already. I expect. to hear&#xD;
of your losing everything at gambling yet."&#xD;
"Thank you for nothing-you know my opinion&#xD;
of gamblers and gambling."&#xD;
"Yes, I know your opinion of a good many mat-&#xD;
ters and things, and I know how a~ertain place is&#xD;
paved."&#xD;
"Ab, I say Horaley," I exclaimed, turning the&#xD;
subject, "if you see Jemes, fernes Jumper, Esq.,&#xD;
do bring him down. I should like to see him&#xD;
again nod inquire into the whole of this affair, for&#xD;
hang me if I have the hang of it yet."&#xD;
"I will; but why not go down to Baltimore your-&#xD;
self, and see all your friends?"&#xD;
"That 1 might do," I replied, but then if my-&#xD;
good aunt was to hear that I was on hand there,&#xD;
she would grow angry with me for my want of&#xD;
respect for her. And the 'put money in thy purse,&#xD;
ptt money in thy purse, Roderigo,' of Ingo, where&#xD;
would I find a chance to fulfill that wise injunc-&#xD;
tion, more to he treasured thait woman's warmest&#xD;
promises. No, sir, read Lord Bacon's essay on&#xD;
friendship, arid there learn what offices a friend&#xD;
may perform for us better than we can for our-&#xD;
selves. I cosid not with any face recouut to my&#xD;
&#xD;

BLE OPINION AS TO THE MANNER IN WHIOII DIFFERENT&#xD;
BEAUTIES SHOULD WEAR THEIR HAIR-.-CONvERSATIoN&#xD;
WITH MiSS VIRGINIA-THE CAROLINA BEAUTY-Nv&#xD;
WAYWARD THOUGHTS OF ALICIL&#xD;
My engagement was to take a drive with a dis-&#xD;
tinguished belle, who was then in the height of&#xD;
her bellehood. She had been educated on the&#xD;
continent of Europe. Her father had been our&#xD;
minister abroad to one of the first courts of the con-&#xD;
tinent, and there, at a very early age, she had&#xD;
figured most extensively. Her love affairs were&#xD;
as numerous as the affairs of some successful duel-&#xD;
ist-for she came off, at least in all instances but&#xD;
one, unharmed, and she had hit her man, I know&#xD;
not how often. In the case in which she was hit&#xD;
herself, she suffered, it was said, much both in her&#xD;
vanity and in her affections.&#xD;
~he met a young sprig of nobility, Lord Light-&#xD;
ner, at some watering place or other, and set out&#xD;
with the intention of catching him. They had&#xD;
ample leisure to play upon each other, and the&#xD;
lady who had always before come off conqueror,&#xD;
now found her match.&#xD;
Like one who wilfully dares their companion to&#xD;
a trial of skill in some game where a missive is&#xD;
thrown to and fro, which each party expects to&#xD;
catch and throw back again, she received a wound&#xD;
whieb she did not expect, and like the conquering&#xD;
gladitor, who calls out in the lists before an am-&#xD;
phitheatre 'habet'-he has it-the nobleman un-&#xD;
harmed in the strife went forth and boasted of his&#xD;
conquest. And ii was a conquest; for everybody&#xD;
saw how much the lady suffered.&#xD;
The nobleman was of mature age, thirty-three,&#xD;
at least, it was said; and when she talked of her&#xD;
girlish penchant for the Lord, which was not very&#xD;
otten, though sometimes it bubbled up in its bit-&#xD;
&#xD;
terness, though it seemed to be the very lightest&#xD;
thing in her memory when she alluded to him,&#xD;
she confessed herself at the period of her acquain-&#xD;
tance with him a girl not seventeen-others said&#xD;
she was out of her teens-but vanity of vanities,&#xD;
says Soloman, who can fix the sliding scale of a&#xD;
woman's age. However, when I knew her she&#xD;
was still in her beauty's bloom-but she affected&#xD;
the company of young men or very old ones, and&#xD;
to me she had taken an especial liking, if I might&#xD;
judge from the pretty things she said to me, and in&#xD;
the glibest way imaginable.&#xD;
I have had some credit for understanding women,&#xD;
and I think I do, where roy own feelings are not&#xD;
involved; but this knowledge has come after much&#xD;
travail and experience, and was not at this time&#xD;
very clear in its conceptions or deductions. I took&#xD;
more of Miss Virginia Upton's compliments&#xD;
for tenderness then than I should now, at least at&#xD;
first-but ~ve soon became fast friends.&#xD;
I must be permitted to say, that I have one per-&#xD;
sonal peculiarity different from most men who have&#xD;
come under my knowledge-I am shy of men, but&#xD;
not of won~en. I never meet a man more than half&#xD;
way, rarely even half way, unless I thoroughly&#xD;
know my man before hand and like him upon in-&#xD;
stinct. Not so with a woman. I think I can say that&#xD;
from my early recollections, provided I was not&#xD;
at all smitten with gill or woman, that I could al-&#xD;
ways approach her unembarrassed. In fact, I&#xD;
mean to say, with a conviction that there was no&#xD;
fear of being repulsed-I mean in the ordinary&#xD;
courtesies of life. That thing called sheepishness,&#xD;
which haunts some men all their lives, I never&#xD;
had anything to do with, except in my childhood,&#xD;
perhaps. So that while I could laugh and chat&#xD;
with women (I like the word woman more than&#xD;
that of lady; a'nd I remember that Mr. John Quincy&#xD;
Adams told me once always to use it when I could&#xD;
in speaking of the sex,) with gaiety and pleasure,&#xD;
and without the least morbid feeling, in the corn-&#xD;
pany of men I often found myself morbid t:ntil&#xD;
warmed with wine, and then I was often savage,&#xD;
and, to tell the plain truth of myself, sometiiries&#xD;
insulting.&#xD;
Beautiful was this fair lady of my liking, (I&#xD;
use the word lady here for the alliteration,) and&#xD;
well she knew how to manage all the artillery of&#xD;
Ii&#xD;
&#xD;
RUSSELL.                                 79&#xD;
her charms. Oh! that deep blue eye of hers, how&#xD;
it flashed through its long fringes! She had a&#xD;
small head and the most exquisitely chisselled tem-&#xD;
ples I ever saw; and then having classic features,&#xD;
she had the taste to weat her hair parted plain,&#xD;
and having beautiful ears she had the sense to show&#xD;
them. I do abomina'te this fashion which many of&#xD;
our wome~i have now-a-days of hiding the ears en-&#xD;
tirely. The fashion must have been invented by&#xD;
some woman who bad been cropped; or, for that's&#xD;
harsh, it must have been invented by some res-&#xD;
plendent and capricious and false beauty who had&#xD;
had that delicate organ bitten off by some jealous&#xD;
lover, whoin pretending to whisper love, revenged&#xD;
himself upon her over-credulous ear for putting&#xD;
faith in his rival's promises.&#xD;
Yes, where a woman has classic features she&#xD;
should always wear her hair plain. Where her&#xD;
features are not classic, regular if you please, and&#xD;
their beauty depends upon their lighting up, and&#xD;
the variety of their expression, then she should&#xD;
wear curls, for they give an archness and win-&#xD;
ninguess to her glancing and flashing eye. These&#xD;
form the ambush from which cupid in such a coun-&#xD;
tenance shoots his keenest arrows. There are some&#xD;
women, however7, who attract with either toilette.&#xD;
t have a fair cousin, that I may write about some&#xD;
of these days, when I wish to speak of the holier&#xD;
influences of life, who presents an equal attraction&#xD;
in either toilette. But then it is the mind and&#xD;
purity and heart that shine forth in all her actions,&#xD;
look forth from her bright face alike in the brilliant&#xD;
toilette of the gay saloon, or in the simple one of&#xD;
her rural home, that gives her such influence over&#xD;
all and wins so surely all hearts.&#xD;
But I was speaking of my friend Virginia. I&#xD;
found her at honie per appointment. The stately&#xD;
carriage was dnwn up before her abode, and, as&#xD;
the waiter, who stood in careless chat on the door&#xD;
step with the driver on the coach box, lifted his&#xD;
hat and told me his mistress ~vas in and really, 1&#xD;
thought I saw on the features of the liveryied lackey&#xD;
a knowing smile as he glanced at my well appoint-&#xD;
ed habiliments, and detected in them a wish to&#xD;
please, which he seemed to pity, (the rascal, so I&#xD;
thought,) as he had every reason to believe it&#xD;
would di~d in discomfiture, a defeat like the efforts&#xD;
of my predecessors.&#xD;

&#xD;
Now, what made me think that? Gentle read&#xD;
ers have you any idea? Knowing that the lad;&#xD;
had proved invulnerable save to one, and that ni&#xD;
more that sutor was in the field and wac perchanc&#xD;
even forgetful of his triumph-knowing this, dii&#xD;
my vanity feel a spur at the lackey's grin'? Did h4&#xD;
grin with any thought at all, or was it merely th~&#xD;
same kind of smile he flung at the feet of ever~&#xD;
visitor, young or old? My barber had told me tha&#xD;
this same lackey had boasted of his mi5tres55 con-&#xD;
quests, and had said (the barber had a peculiar:&#xD;
smile I thought, too, when he told it,) that I ofter&#xD;
visited her-and the barber scrutinized my faee a~&#xD;
he held my nose, and an involuntary movement or&#xD;
my luart had caused him to give me a cut, the only&#xD;
unseemly appurtenance to my physiognomy, which&#xD;
was coat-plastered, yet-. Now the quere is,&#xD;
had all these circumstances made me more anxious&#xD;
to please than was my wont, as I pauaiud a iiiu meni&#xD;
to glance over my person and see that all was right,&#xD;
and given m'a a consciousness of a nervous desire tc&#xD;
please as I glided into the lady's presence? You&#xD;
dissectors of the human heart, analize it.&#xD;
"AhI you traitor, yo5!~~ she exclaimed, hall&#xD;
rising from her chair and giving me her hand-&#xD;
not her "jewelled hand" as the novelists say, for&#xD;
there was no jewel on it, and only the ornament of&#xD;
a plain go~d ring on the middle finger-a ring that&#xD;
had a history I thought, "How dare you keep a&#xD;
lady so? You are old enough to know better."&#xD;
I felt myself blush, (how I hated it,) while the&#xD;
lady's merry laugh started her mocking bird in the&#xD;
next room to an envious imitation of it.&#xD;
"Oh you creature, why did not you keep your&#xD;
appointment and come to the very mor1ient? Why,&#xD;
don't you know that you should have been seen&#xD;
walking up and down on the other side of the&#xD;
street impatiently awaiting the hour which you&#xD;
dared not anticipate."&#xD;
Piqued at the allusion to my age, (for I shaved&#xD;
twice every day, besides using bear's grease and&#xD;
macasser in aid of a mustache which I was deter-&#xD;
mined to bring to life on my upper lip,) I said, as&#xD;
I took her hand, which I half elevated to my lips&#xD;
as I bowed over it-&#xD;
"I was detained (false, every bit of it,) in alle-&#xD;
giance to a beauty of my native State."&#xD;
"Allegiance to a beauty of your native State!"&#xD;
&#xD;
I- exclaimed Miss Virginia, with some sharpness......&#xD;
y "And who is she that takes your allegiance from&#xD;
a your plighted engagement?"&#xD;
"Miss Singleton,~l I said.&#xD;
I    "Miss Singleton!  Your dancing-master, Mr.&#xD;
a Russel, should have taught you more than the&#xD;
a making a pretty bow."&#xD;
"AhI Miss Virginia, my reverence for beauty,&#xD;
like my obedience, is an instinct. Miss Singleton&#xD;
claimed my attendance to a portrait painters, and&#xD;
r I could not leave her in the midst, when the artist&#xD;
said he was in the vein, and meant to paint the&#xD;
most beautiful woman in the United States-of&#xD;
course that means the world-! could not leave&#xD;
her-you would have banished me from your side,&#xD;
had I dared to do such a thing. Reverence for all&#xD;
your sex proves one capable of adoring one. My&#xD;
allegiance is due to Carolina, but I thought, to be&#xD;
honest, that if the artist should claim you for his&#xD;
canvass too, by the right that artists have to claim&#xD;
the beautiful for sitters, that the "ripe and real"&#xD;
may live upon the canvass and outshine the "ideal."&#xD;
The 1 ady looked nettled for a moment at the&#xD;
- slight allusion that the quotation might make to her&#xD;
own age, and exclaimed, interrupting me,&#xD;
"Upon my word, sir, you are a bold speech-&#xD;
maker."&#xD;
"f-lear me out-and I am sorry that I have to&#xD;
confess it-but my allegiance to Carolina shall not&#xD;
be broken-and this treason against her, if 'tis told&#xD;
upon me, I shall deny-yet I must confess that I&#xD;
am aware that if the artist I have named should&#xD;
claim you as a sitter by the prescriptive right I&#xD;
have recited, Carolina in the encounter will meet&#xD;
with a rivalry as fearful as that which her noblest&#xD;
son has to maintain in the Senate."&#xD;
"Rivalry in the Senate," lisped the proud beau-&#xD;
ty, while her bust heaved with pride, "Say inns-&#xD;
teu~', sir." -&#xD;
"No. I have denied my allegiance to 'the 'nost&#xD;
beautiful woman of my State, and the force of trea-&#xD;
son like the force of nature, in making Milton a&#xD;
poet, can no further ~&#xD;
"You think her beautiful?" said Miss Upton.&#xD;
"Beautiful!" I exclaimed, echoing her. "By&#xD;
this fair hand," and I took her hand again in one&#xD;
of mine, as she half raised it as I made the vow-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE A~YTOllIOGRApHy OF&#xD;
&#xD;
WJLLIA1M&#xD;
"By this fair hand, I know but one inure fair,&#xD;
more beautiful."&#xD;
"You are a&#xD;
"I have not uttered who."&#xD;
Ah, but my heart was no traitor if my lips had&#xD;
beca-for the lady of the Monumental City, the&#xD;
fair Alice, came to my lips, and I almost felt will-&#xD;
ful enough to pronounce it. I would have done so&#xD;
if I had not thought of Peterson; but I bowed again&#xD;
and said, "I am no flatterer-pardon me."&#xD;
I raised Miss Upton from her chair, and handed&#xD;
her to her carriage.&#xD;
On we rolled, and I felt a kind of exulting proud&#xD;
wish-as if I had been injured by her-to meet&#xD;
Alice Clare as I chatted to the fair lady by my&#xD;
side. We swept into the avenue on a drive to the&#xD;
Navy Yard, where Miss Upton meant to call, to in-&#xD;
troduce me to a friend, and I was particularly&#xD;
pleased with the attention which the handsome&#xD;
equipage of Miss Virginia, and, I thought, to say&#xD;
nothing of herself, the distingue appearance of&#xD;
the gentleman beside her attracted. Happily, the&#xD;
reflection occurred to me at this very moment that&#xD;
I was becoming a puppy; and then while 1 still&#xD;
wished that Alice Clare could see me (oh! how I&#xD;
wanted to see her, though,) a rush of sadness and&#xD;
sorrow broke over my heart.&#xD;
"Something that's bitter will arise,&#xD;
Even amidst our jollities,"&#xD;
and we suffer our passions to make sad wreck of all&#xD;
that is noble in our nature. "A h!" I thought to&#xD;
myself, "I wonder if Alice has as much of the&#xD;
heart-ache as I have."&#xD;
"Pray, what are you so abstracted about?" said&#xD;
Miss Virginia.&#xD;
"Thinking that this pleasure must so scion end;&#xD;
that you think of so many, wh('n so many think&#xD;
of only you." And then, in a most rascally way,&#xD;
I made the quotation whieh 1 had often made to&#xD;
Alice-&#xD;
"The nsooa looks&#xD;
On many brooks,&#xD;
The brook can see no moon but one."&#xD;
And I made my voice, in uttering it, catch a tone&#xD;
of tenderness from the well-spring of my heart,&#xD;
where the memory of Alice was stirring its foun-&#xD;
&#xD;
RUSSELL.                                 81&#xD;
tains at that very moment-like some fugitive&#xD;
poet-fugitive I mean from true sentiment as well&#xD;
as in rhyme-who kills two birds with one stone,&#xD;
and makes the verses, the inspiration of which he&#xD;
had caught from one woman, do execution on an-&#xD;
other.&#xD;
Miss Upton smiled. "You'll do," she said, "but&#xD;
oh, you prodigal, why waste your geld so lavishly?&#xD;
Why fling it away with so profuse a hand?-have&#xD;
you none for Miss Singleton?&#xD;
"Why, if you refuse it I can gather it again," I&#xD;
replied, "for Miss Singleton or Miss Anybody&#xD;
else.'&#xD;
"You mean to say its a charitable gift, and not&#xD;
my deservings?~~ I smiled, and she continued-&#xD;
"Ali! there's Miss Singleton. Who's that young&#xD;
gentleman with her?"&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
YOUNG SANGSTON WiTh MISS SINGLETON-ms FATflEE-&#xD;

hER SlANT ADNIREItS-IIER MANNER TO 5ANGSTON-&#xD;
Ills FEELiNGS-MORE THAN POLITICAL RiVALRIES iN&#xD;
wAShINGTON-NOT CONFINED TO POLITICIANS.&#xD;
I turned in my lolling posture beside Miss Upton,&#xD;
for we were riding towards the Capitol and I wan&#xD;
seated at her left, so that she commanded the view&#xD;
of that side of the avenue which is frequented by&#xD;
the fashionable wayfarers, and I incl;ning to her,&#xD;
could not so easily observe the crowd-I turned,&#xD;
and there was Miss Singleton with young Sangs-&#xD;
ton, an official in the - Department.&#xD;
"lie was the only son of his mother, and she a&#xD;
widow." 11cr history is a very common one in&#xD;
Washirt~ton. Her husband, Jamc~Sangston, was&#xD;
from Alabama, which State lie had represented in&#xD;
Congress for several years. Afierwards, in Mr.&#xD;
Monroe's administration, lie had taken office as an&#xD;
auditor-which Ilosition is a most respectable one,&#xD;
with a handsome salary attached, which salary Mr.&#xD;
Sangaton more than expended in the profuse enter-&#xD;
tainment of his friends-for he had many, and lie&#xD;
thought he had more than he really possessed, for,&#xD;
there were few who failed to accept his invitations;&#xD;
"The heartless parasites of present cheer."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC8021-00000041"/>&#xD;
His wife was from the State of New York. Sh&#xD;
was devoted to her husband, and she tried in van&#xD;
to check his lavish expenditure. With tl~e fre&#xD;
impulses of the South, Mr. Sangston had exprosset&#xD;
his political preferences; and on the accession o&#xD;
General Jackson to the presidency he was removed&#xD;
His habits, never good even while in office, (the~&#xD;
formed the ostensible grounds for hi~ removal,;&#xD;
became worse when he found himself pennyless,&#xD;
and incapable of earning a livelihood for his wife&#xD;
His son, the young gentleman with Miss Sange.&#xD;
ton, had held a subordinate clerkship under his&#xD;
father before he was of age, and he shared the of-&#xD;
ficial fate of the old gentleman. They certainly&#xD;
were two helpless men-father and son.&#xD;
Mrs. Sangs~on~s only resource was to open a&#xD;
boarding house, (this is a very common case in&#xD;
Washington) and while she was toiling along, sor-&#xD;
rowfully indeed, half of her time being devoted to&#xD;
her husband in his fits of intemperance, or in his&#xD;
illness consequent upon his recovery front them-&#xD;
he suddenly died. All at once great compassion&#xD;
was felt for the widow, who was more to be pitied&#xD;
as a wife, and young Sangston was restored to the&#xD;
clerkship which he had held under his father.&#xD;
At the time of which I speak the mother was&#xD;
keeping boarders; a small number, but her's was&#xD;
the fashionable boarding house of the city, and her&#xD;
son, Henry Sangston, was in office, boarding with&#xD;
her. He had been restored to his place, as it was&#xD;
said, to aid his mother with his salary; but I fear&#xD;
the fa0t was that his mother aided him. She cer-&#xD;
tainly had, for her means, heavy debts to pay&#xD;
for him, for he had all the prodigality of his father,&#xD;
and lie also inherited his father's fondness for con-&#xD;
vivality, (for a vice is sometimes an inheritance---&#xD;
and this is one .f the ways in which the sins of the&#xD;
father are visited upon his children.)&#xD;
I made Henry Sangston's acquaintances at the&#xD;
time of Horsiey senior's removal front Bladensbnrg.&#xD;
That worthy gentleman had a great regard even&#xD;
for the smallest current coin of Uncle Sam, and he&#xD;
therefore, before he would suffer himself to be re-&#xD;
moved from Bladensburg, made arrangements to be&#xD;
tdken to a private house, dreading the over-charg-&#xD;
i~g of the hotels. He grumbled at Mrs. Sangston's&#xD;
price to me-but she had known his wife, and he&#xD;
felt if his wound should take a "turn,'~ that she&#xD;
&#xD;
e would attend him with more than a mercenary care,&#xD;
ra and a care above a mercenary one he did not think&#xD;
a himself likely to receive any where else-for he&#xD;
I had an awful opinion of matters, morals and things&#xD;
f kn Washington.&#xD;
In waiting on Horslcy senior, and in calling up-&#xD;
on his son, at Mrs. Sangston~s, I made the intimate&#xD;
acquaintance of her son, who knew all the "ropes"&#xD;
of Washington life; and I became there, too, ac-&#xD;
qunin ted with Miss Sallie Singleton, who was a&#xD;
beauty, belle'and fortune, from my native State.-&#xD;
She was a boarder in the house. Repeatedly&#xD;
Horsley had pressed me to come to Mrs. Sangs-&#xD;
ton's, but I did not like to leav't my hotel without&#xD;
paying my bill; and I did not choose to ask even&#xD;
Horslcy to lend me the money, as I was actually&#xD;
ashamed of the amount I owed,-my wine bill, to&#xD;
say nothing of extras, amounting to twice as much&#xD;
as my board bill.&#xD;
Painters talk about having certain persons or&#xD;
pictures for a study. So had I studies-studies that&#xD;
had my heart in them-and among those choicest&#xD;
of the gallery was Miss Virginia Upton and&#xD;
Miss Sallie Singleton. 1 don't know but what my&#xD;
heart was at times emulous of a Turk's harem-&#xD;
that is full of many beauties at once. For though&#xD;
Martha Jones, "my own lonian Myrrha,~~ and&#xD;
those later beauties of my acquaintance sometimes&#xD;
took strong hold of my imagination, and particular-&#xD;
ly "my own lonian Myrrha;" yet, the full tide of&#xD;
my feelings was like that of the Mississippi, which&#xD;
in its many findings seems to run to all the differ-&#xD;
ent points of the compass, but which yet finds the&#xD;
Gulf of Mexico-growing the stronger and the&#xD;
straighter the nearer it approaches its absorbing&#xD;
ocean.&#xD;
Miss Singleton was beautiful. She had the&#xD;
dark eye and the complexion of one "whose blood&#xD;
is all ~ but then there was a subdued&#xD;
gentleness and truthfulness in all she said that con-&#xD;
trasted very much with the badinage and dash of&#xD;
Miss Upton. Yet there was, perchance, a deeper&#xD;
spring of pride in the heart of Miss Sallie than intliat&#xD;
of Miss Virginia. The Carolinian had spent mu~,h&#xD;
of her time on a retired plantation, where the a~m&#xD;
of every one was to please her; and what she h ~ad&#xD;
seen of society had been calculated further to im-&#xD;

THE AUTOI3IOGRAPHY OF&#xD;

&#xD;
press her with the conviction that she was to have&#xD;
her own way. Yet she was subdued and gentle,&#xD;
not only because it was in some Measure her na-&#xD;
ture, but also because she had been brought up af-&#xD;
ter the fashion that to seem subdued and gentle&#xD;
was to be what a fair Carolinian of her fortune and&#xD;
beauty ought to be. Her's was a different beauty&#xD;
from Miss Upton's. The deep tint on her cheek&#xD;
sometimes wore a hectic look, and there was a&#xD;
brightness in her eye then that startled you with&#xD;
its dazzling brilliance. Her tones, as soft as ever&#xD;
woman uttered, came from lips tremulous with a&#xD;
shrinking ~ensitiveness, unless their possessor was&#xD;
aroused; and then, if she felt at all aggrieved, her&#xD;
voice became commanding, and her rather slight&#xD;
figure assumed a quiet majesty that was the more&#xD;
impressive because it was so entirely natural and&#xD;
so entirely the type of her emotions. A great many&#xD;
lovers, men of position, wealth and intellect, had&#xD;
approached Miss Singleton with every homage,~&#xD;
but she had, according to report, turned a deaf ear&#xD;
upon all of them.&#xD;
I was popular with he~, I flattered myself, for&#xD;
nore reasons than from the fact that I was a Caro-&#xD;
linian. And the truth is, that not having any de-&#xD;
sign upon the ladies, and being, as I have said be-&#xD;
fore, from my soul devoted to female society, I had&#xD;
entirely a frank, cordial, off-hand, and at the same&#xD;
time attached manner to them, that I may be al-&#xD;
lowed to say was taking-I do not mcan to say in&#xD;
a lover, but in an acquaintance-and likely to win&#xD;
him the confidence and friendship of the lady to&#xD;
whom he might devote himself though her feelings&#xD;
towards him might not wear the least of a warmer&#xD;
tinge.       -&#xD;
Crowds of admirers, flatterers and lovers, crowd-&#xD;

Sometimes she was fitful and abstracted, and re-&#xD;
ceived them like a queen tired of state-and then&#xD;
she ~vould deny herself, and in the afternoon, when&#xD;
Sangston was free of his official duties--in fact he&#xD;
was very often free of them in the morning, as he&#xD;
was not very steady in his attendance-she would&#xD;
ask him to read to her, and sit and listen to him&#xD;
for hours, watching the play of his finn feat urea, as&#xD;
full of emotion and diffident homage he obeyed her&#xD;

might anticipate her wishes.&#xD;
He could not bear to be teased about her. lie&#xD;
did not seem to aspire to her hand, but he seemed&#xD;
hopelessly, and yet with a happy forgetfulness of&#xD;
all but the present, to haunt her presence. Some-&#xD;
times she would show him a thousand delicate lit-&#xD;
tle attentions, and ask him for a book, or to mend&#xD;
a pen, or "please, Mr. Sangston;to ring the hell,"&#xD;
in a way that made the men of the world and sen-&#xD;
sualists about her, who loved her all the more be-&#xD;
cause her glorious beauty had so many golden&#xD;
charms and whose eagerness in the pursuit had a&#xD;
double spur, fix their eyes keenly on the two and&#xD;
-den exchange glances with each other, and scan&#xD;
the points of their boots, or perchance the spots on&#xD;
the carpet, when in all probability the least adven-&#xD;
turous spirit among them would take his leave in&#xD;
an abrupt manner. At other times, Miss Singleton&#xD;
would languishingly or abstractedly pass through&#xD;
the room where Sangston was without apparently&#xD;
noticing him, to take a loitering ~troll with some&#xD;
attached of some of the foreign ministers, or with&#xD;
some idler about town who was seeking office or a&#xD;
fortune, whichever he could get, a ad staving off his&#xD;
promises to pay to his landlord and tailor by the&#xD;
promises of office, which he would assert was to be&#xD;
fulfilled at the firbt of the next week. It is aston-&#xD;
ishing how many sets off of this kind, promises&#xD;
against promises, there are in Washington.&#xD;
Poor Sangston, if 1 met him at night, I could&#xD;
always tell what had been the course of Miss&#xD;
Sangston's conduct through the day. If she had&#xD;
not noticed him, and had promenaded with one of&#xD;
those personages, or had gone to a baIl or party with&#xD;
one of them, he was sure to indulge himself at&#xD;
night; and more than once I have taken him to my&#xD;
hotel when he could not take himsclt'homc.&#xD;
All the above of this chapter has been written for&#xD;
ray reader, in answe to Miss Upton's remark that&#xD;
there was Miss Singleton, and her inquiry as to&#xD;
who that young gentleman was with her? I did&#xD;
not tell any of it to Miss Upton, for they were&#xD;
ahead of us on the avenue, and as we drove along&#xD;
Miss Upton answered her own question-&#xD;
"Oh! it's young Sangston." And then she pull-&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
SANG5TON-DEVOTES HIMSELF TO MISS UFTON-CONvER-&#xD;
*     STATION WITH HIM ABOUT HER-MISS SINGLETON ANt&#xD;
TIlE WHEREFORE OF TILE CHANGE.&#xD;
A few days after this delightful drive with Miss&#xD;
Upton, Sangston called on me late in the evening,&#xD;
and expressed himself in the most exaggerated terms&#xD;
of admiration of that lady. I had known that ol&#xD;
late he frequently visited her; in fact, I had met&#xD;
him at her house, and I thought the lady was more&#xD;
than usually kind to him. Miss Singleton I found&#xD;
was growing cold apparently, and at times haugh-&#xD;
ty, even supercilious; and Sangston evidently was&#xD;
surprised at her changed deportment sustaining&#xD;
itself so long, under which he began to grc~w very&#xD;
moody. At first, his frequent visited ~o Miss Upton&#xD;
and her open encouragement of him gave him the&#xD;
highest spirits, though they were evidently of a&#xD;
wild and reckless character. lie had the feelings&#xD;
of a gentleman, and such a delicate sense of the&#xD;
proprieties of life that, when excited with wine,&#xD;
he usually hurried away from the presence of the&#xD;
ladies~though I have known him, when very&#xD;
much depressed in spirits, t( resort to stimulants&#xD;
before he went to a party.&#xD;
&#xD;
)GRAPJIY OF&#xD;
&#xD;
tI How ill at ease he was with all his gay badinage&#xD;
about the beauteous Miss Upton. I had some ex-&#xD;
- perience, and I read him easier than he thought I&#xD;
a did. My theatrical adventures connected with&#xD;
I Miss Watson's name, had given, and continued to&#xD;
3 give me a tremendous eclat among the young men,&#xD;
and, in fact, it had created no little talk among the&#xD;
a ladies; while a good many of them believed that&#xD;
1 there existed an attachment between Alice Clare&#xD;
I and myself, the impression was that I Jiad behaved&#xD;
- badly to Alice, and some of the ladies took her&#xD;
part fiercely, though I never knew that she thank-&#xD;
ed them for it or ajspreciated it,-nevertheless it&#xD;
gave me as much eclat with the women as my re-&#xD;
3 ported deportment with Capt. Merrymen did with&#xD;
the men. Knowing how sensitive Sangston Was&#xD;
about the sex, and particularly about Miss Single-&#xD;
tin, I felt a delicacy in speaking to him as to my&#xD;
view of matters, but I thought I would talk at him&#xD;
a little one evening, so I said:&#xD;
"That Upton girl is a character!~~&#xD;
"Oh! great, great! magnificent! "lie exclaimed.&#xD;
"You've heard her history?"&#xD;
"Oh yes. The tale is here that she fell in love&#xD;
with some puppy of a lord abroad, but 1 don't be-&#xD;
lieve a word of it."&#xD;
"Oh! those who are not up to matters and things&#xD;
are of the impression that she was desperately in&#xD;
love with him, but Clements, who was abroad at&#xD;
the time, tells me it is no such thing; he was inti-&#xD;
mate with her at that very time-in fact, they say&#xD;
she was once not indifferent to hjm."&#xD;
"They say," said [to myself. "1 tell you,&#xD;
Sangston," I continued aloud, "don't tell on me."&#xD;
"I will not, on my word," he exclaimed, look-&#xD;
ing earnestly at me.&#xD;
"Well, Miss Upton has no particular quantity&#xD;
of heart to be impressed by any body-she's a flirt&#xD;
-and all's fish that comes to her net."&#xD;
"Oh! Russell-what makes you think she's a&#xD;
flirt?"&#xD;
"These and these!'1 I exclaimed, putting my&#xD;
hands to my eyes and ears.&#xD;
"You don't pretend to say she' has flirted you?3~&#xD;
"Nc~, sir," 1 replied, provoked: "that's not in&#xD;
her power-beautiful and fascinating and hewitch&#xD;
ing as she is. Love's a foregone conclusion with&#xD;
&#xD;
me.'1 And I sighed, half from my heart and half&#xD;
in vanity.&#xD;
"Yes, the actress?"&#xD;
"No, no, sir. In this world we never appreciate,&#xD;
until it is' too late, the character of the woman who&#xD;
really regards us. some Delilah of our imagina-&#xD;
tion, or Delilah in fact, plays the deuce with us-&#xD;
reduces us to as blind and as desperate a condition&#xD;
as Samson, and ' yes us as much."&#xD;
"I don't understand you."&#xD;
"It's true," I said-arid then bolted out the in-&#xD;
quiry: "How get you on with my fair sister of&#xD;
Carolina-.-.the lady of the Palmetto State-the&#xD;
eclipsing star in all this constellation of beauty&#xD;
here in Washington, where beauties most do con-&#xD;
gregare?~~&#xD;
A crimson flush passed over Sangstoa's face and&#xD;
he said,&#xD;
"I don't get on with her at all-don't talk about&#xD;
her. Let's drink something-pardon me ifI order&#xD;
it in your room." I bowed. "Well, the Upton is&#xD;
a glorious girl, that's a fact. She says she likes&#xD;
you very much."&#xD;
"Yes- she says you have a magnetic way with&#xD;
women, and that you have stood fire so often that&#xD;
she suspects you think you have a charmed life-&#xD;
a charmed heart-and she quoted something from&#xD;
somebody, which I forget."&#xD;
"Well, she certainly has never tried any spell&#xD;
upon me, yet am I often spell-hound by her neyer-&#xD;
theless,-but I think the Palmetto lady is the eclip-&#xD;
sing one, 5angston.3~&#xD;
"Many think so," he said, looking down. There&#xD;
was a pause, and he continued: "That Englishman,&#xD;
the Mr. Dudley that I have seen you with, he has&#xD;
almost entirely quit going to sue Miss Upton and&#xD;
devotes hi:nself entirely to Miss Singleton. I tell&#xD;
you, i{ ussel," and he tried to laugh-oh! what a&#xD;
hollow laugh it was-"She used to keep entirely&#xD;
to her private parlor, and sometimes would not see&#xD;
any body for days, at least in the afternoon; and&#xD;
she spent most of her evenings there, at the harp&#xD;
or piano, and now she spends all' her indoor hours&#xD;
in the public parlor-has had her harp brought&#xD;
down there, and your humble ~ here&#xD;
he bit his lips-"is not even noticed by her as she&#xD;
&#xD;
passes through the room or takes a seat to enter-&#xD;
tain the crowd of gentlemen bowing around her."&#xD;
"Have you piqued her in any way?"&#xD;
"Piqued her!" and here he stopped, having, I&#xD;
thought, at first the impulse from wounded feelings&#xD;
to insinuate he had, and thus account for her change&#xD;
of manner, but the truth asserted its right and he&#xD;
said, filling ,his glass with the sparkling liquid&#xD;
which had been introduced at his request-"No;&#xD;
piqued her-if any thing I have been her slave to&#xD;
fetch arid carry, and she asked me the other day-&#xD;
I blush to tell it, but she did-she asked me the&#xD;
other day if I Was now going of errands for Miss&#xD;
Upton."&#xD;
"How came you to be so intimate with Miss&#xD;
Upton all at once? you have cut me out there de-&#xD;
cidedly"&#xD;
"Ah! Russell, every body knows that you don't&#xD;
care a fig ahnut any of our ladies here. You're a&#xD;
fortune-my father squandered oner and I am a&#xD;
poor clerk, worse than a beggar. What care you&#xD;
for any of the women here, with the love of that&#xD;
glorious actress, who outshines them all?"&#xD;
"No, Sangston, she does not outshine them all,&#xD;
not even as an actress-at least in private theatri-&#xD;
cals and private acting. My dear fellow, all the&#xD;
world's a stage, and all the men and women mere-&#xD;
ly players. I'm not speaking of Miss Watson,&#xD;
mark you,-who is siincerely my friend, and whom&#xD;
I respect profoundly-but hang me if I mean to let&#xD;
any of these women play upon me, if I can help&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"Nor 1, nor I," exclaimed Sangston, and then&#xD;
his voice sunk to a tone of touching despondency&#xD;
as he remarked, "but what woman would care to&#xD;
play upon me?"&#xD;
I wanted from my soul to tell him that Miss Up-&#xD;
ton might care, for the frolic of the thing; but I&#xD;
reflected it would only wound his feeling~ in the&#xD;
mood he was in, and I forbore; but I determined to&#xD;
devote myself more particularly to Miss Singleton,&#xD;
and .1 thought, when Horslcy returned with remit-&#xD;
tances from my aunt so that I could settle my bill,&#xD;
that I ~vould take rooms at Mrs. Sangston's.&#xD;

SItE DOES.&#xD;
4&#xD;
'I'ime, that: never plays truant from his duty,&#xD;
kept on his way. My remittances came through&#xD;
Florsely, who wrote me a laconic note, saying that&#xD;
my aunt Betsy had "forked ovet" without com-&#xD;
plaint the five hundred dollars, (I was provoked&#xD;
with myself that I did not get him so ask for a&#xD;
thousand) and that he would write at length soon,&#xD;
or see but still staid the hotel, meaning'&#xD;
me;         I      at&#xD;
to take rooms at Mrs. S~ngstoa's some time or&#xD;
other. But I frequently called upon Miss Single-&#xD;
ton, and Miss Upton, with some temper, had jested&#xD;
me more than once upon my increasing admiration&#xD;
for the fair Carolinian.&#xD;
"She'll fling you off as she did poor Saugston,"&#xD;
she remarked with a peculiar smile.&#xD;
"I'm told that you took him off from the fair&#xD;
Carolinian," I said, "if he was ever on with her-&#xD;
or rather that you attempted to console him for&#xD;
her cruelty, and grew tired of the care of a broken&#xD;
heart which you could not mend."&#xD;
"Tired! poor fellow, he is like a battle-door among&#xD;
the ladies-driven from one to the other-because&#xD;
no one receives him but to show the skill with&#xD;
which site can throw him back again. 1 understand&#xD;
he was turned out of office last week-I hope it is&#xD;
not so. He used to visit me a great deal in office&#xD;
hours, but when I suspected that he might be neg-&#xD;
lecting his official ditties I discouraged his visits.&#xD;
Indeed, to speak out, Mr. Russell, I hear and .1&#xD;
fear that his habits are very bad."&#xD;
And this was the way poor Sangston's ruisfor-&#xD;
tunes and faults were disc~issed by two who were&#xD;
his intimates, arid one of them at least, his well-&#xD;
wisher and friend.&#xD;
It was true that he had been dismissed f~onn his&#xD;
&#xD;
OGRAPHY OF&#xD;
&#xD;
ton I had not seen but once since his dismissal,&#xD;
when he was much excited; tind day after day&#xD;
passed away and I did not see him, though 1 often&#xD;
wondered where he was, and I expected certainly&#xD;
to meet him. Some new acquaintances, to whom&#xD;
I felt myself bound to attend, had engrossed hit&#xD;
visiting hours, and I had not seen Miss Singleton&#xD;
since Sangston's removal-when one day I receiv-&#xD;
ed an urgent note from her requesting that I would&#xD;
call and see her as soon as possible.&#xD;
I accordingly betook myself to Mrs. Sangaton's&#xD;
boarding house, wondering what Miss Singleton&#xD;
could want with me, and was shown into her pri-&#xD;
vate parlor.&#xD;
There was the harp over which I had seen her&#xD;
so frequently bend, and I noticed the many little&#xD;
evidences, even in the very placing of the smallest&#xD;
ornaments, which showed that the presiding ge&#xD;
nius of the Itlace was a refined and intellectual wo-&#xD;
man. This matter of love, thought I, is a mar-&#xD;
vellous matter, for I certainly feel not the least&#xD;
trepidation ta awaiting the entrance of this most&#xD;
celebrated belle of the South; wlten, were it Alice&#xD;
Clare whom I expected, ~r Miss Watson, or even&#xD;
Martha Booth 1 am satisfied that by its increased&#xD;
pulsation I should certainly feel that I had a heart.&#xD;
While I was reflecting in this way, proud of the&#xD;
self-possession I felt and of the fact that Miss Sin-&#xD;
gleton could raise no thrill in my tumultuous tem-&#xD;
perament, which I could not, like a skillful mana-&#xD;
ger of fiery steeds control to my advantage, t4e&#xD;
lady entereil the room. I certainly was struck&#xD;
with art altered look in her. Though not a cold&#xD;
morning, (the winters are never severe in Wash-&#xD;
ington,) she was closely wrapped in a large shawl,&#xD;
and her quiet manner had a subdued and earnest&#xD;
look about it that I thought indicated some peculiar&#xD;
state of feeling in the lady.&#xD;
"It is a cold rooming, NIr. Russell," she said, as&#xD;
I rose at her entrance; "You are a stray from yooi&#xD;
allegarice to South Carolina, if we may jttdge front&#xD;
your visits to the daughters of your native State."&#xD;
"No! I acknowledge~ you as my fair representa-&#xD;

thought no cause was assigned. It was said that Slate has iii all this wide confederacy-but I have&#xD;

~peai loId)y, but there is something which I can-&#xD;
uot exactly tell you."&#xD;
"Vet' cannot tell me all," I said, looking at her&#xD;
In a sertutenizing manner.&#xD;
"Why try to divine that which I will not tell,&#xD;
then, Mr. Russell?"&#xD;
"1 will not. It will be my greatest pleasure to&#xD;
serve you-and only what you would have me&#xD;
know would I ~ and I could not but smile&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"I understand your smile, sir."&#xD;
"Indeed then you understand more than I do."&#xD;
"Enough,"-but she looked annoyed, and a&#xD;
little of the self-will of a petted woman came to her&#xD;
brow as she said, almost in a peremptory tone-&#xD;
"Will you do what I ask, Mr. Russell?"&#xD;
Certainly-as I have said, any thing that you&#xD;
ask I will do."&#xD;
"A thought strikes me. Suppose you send it in&#xD;
an anonymous letter-say that the party writing&#xD;
the letter felt himself indebted that much to his&#xD;
father and sent it to him. Cannot you manage&#xD;
then to see him when he gets the letter; or, if von&#xD;
please, get it for hint from the posi-uffice, carry it&#xD;
to him, and see that in his recklessness Ite does not&#xD;
spend that too, but takes it to his mother, brings it&#xD;
here and reforms his habits. I wonder if he re-&#xD;
rnetnbers he was to go with me to the next levee?"&#xD;
"Doubiless he does, Miss Singleton.' You know&#xD;
what your influence is over hint-exert it, will&#xD;
you not?"&#xD;
"Mr. Russell-how can 1, a young lady, exert&#xD;
it properly?"&#xD;
I smiled again as I replied, "Easily, Miss Single-&#xD;
ton-speak to ~Sangston with the frankness you&#xD;
have spoken to me."&#xD;
She arose, and walking to the window looked&#xD;
out into the street, and then turning to me she&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"Here, here's pen ink and paper, write the let-&#xD;
ter, 1 pray 3Oti, and enclose these notes to'Mr.&#xD;
Sttngston. I utteant to buy a fbolish otrttament with&#xD;

Bickory's eyes."&#xD;
&#xD;
"If you flash it in old Hickory's eyes," I said,&#xD;
"I fear you will only make them flash with anger&#xD;
when you call on him."&#xD;
Miss Singleton replied, looking at me with a&#xD;
dignity and an earnestness which surprised me-&#xD;
"Over brave natures a woman always exerts an&#xD;
influence. It is to me a salient point in the old&#xD;
chief's character that he pays so much respect to&#xD;
my sex, and always has paid it. His wife, who&#xD;
was quite a common-place person, he treated with&#xD;
every kindness, with devoted tenderness, and it is&#xD;
to) his honor. Too many of the great men here,&#xD;
who pretend to think very harshly of the old chief&#xD;
and of his private character, might do well to imi-&#xD;
tate him in this."&#xD;
"Well, Miss Singleton," I said with emphasis,&#xD;
"Do you not feel that the lesson-pardon me, let&#xD;
me say lesson-..-you read me just now upon devo-&#xD;
ting myself to fashionable frivolities might have a&#xD;
little of a moral in them for the fair speaker her-&#xD;
self?"&#xD;
"Well ~'uut, sir. Yes, I deserve it-I came home&#xD;
from a heartless party last night-.-.and felt that I&#xD;
deserved it. Oh! the frivolities, the follies, to say&#xD;
nothing of the vices herel-but the letter, Mr.&#xD;
Russell."&#xD;
I took my seat at her table. As I arranged the&#xD;
paper to write, she threw herself back in a rocking&#xD;
chair and took up one of Scott's novels, which lay&#xD;
on the table. I wrote as follows:&#xD;
"Sir: I feel myself to be indebted to your late&#xD;
father some two hundred dollars. 1 have heard&#xD;
that you have been removed from office, and I sup-&#xD;
pose you need the money. I tlterefore return it to&#xD;
you, glad that I can relieve nty cotiscience by so&#xD;
doing, arid happy that I have it to send to you in an&#xD;
emergency. It is not necessary for you to know&#xD;
who 1 am; be satisfied that I am, though I say so&#xD;
aronymously,                Youa ~&#xD;
"Will that olo'?" said I, reading it aloud to Miss&#xD;
'Singleton; "or shall I tell him to devote it to the&#xD;
specific ofiico'.-.-to, give it to his mother in payment&#xD;
of the sum he has lost at the gaming table?"&#xD;
"As you think best," she replied.&#xD;
Alter a nioment's reflection, I remarked:&#xD;
"I will setod titis, and put it in the post office, so&#xD;
Lhat it utay have the postmark. I will contrive to&#xD;

&#xD;
WILLIAM RUSSELL.&#xD;
&#xD;
I enclosed the notes which Miss Singleton hand-&#xD;
ed me,(confusedly, I don't know why. unless I&#xD;
thought that men should do such things for men,&#xD;
and not wait for women to do them,) and sealed&#xD;
aoddireeted the letter. I now took up my hat to&#xD;
depart, when Miss Singleton said-&#xD;
"I have paid you a great compliment-do you&#xD;
know it?"&#xD;
"In the deepest recesses of my soid, where the&#xD;
fact of this interview lives in silence, I know it,"&#xD;
I replied. She gave me her hand-to her infinite&#xD;
surprise I bowed low and kissed it as I took it.&#xD;
"Pardon me, Miss Singleton," I said with dig-&#xD;
nity, "it was not the beautiful hand which I kiss-&#xD;
ed, but the charity and mercy enshrined there."&#xD;
"Ab! but you can say pretty things, Mr. Wil-&#xD;
liam Russell," exclaimed Miss Singleton, as she&#xD;
gently withdrew her hand so lingeringly that I&#xD;
hardly felt it leave mine, as her surprise gave place&#xD;
is a blush and a smile. And Mr. William Russell&#xD;
thought so too, as the proud girl looked after him&#xD;
kindly as he withdrew. Then the image of Alice&#xD;
Clare flashed through my mind. "Yes," said Ito&#xD;
myself, descending at once from the sublime to the&#xD;
ridiculous, ("there is but one step" said Napolean,&#xD;
and ridicule is the test of truth,) the proverb says&#xD;
"there are as good fish in the sea as were ever&#xD;
caught"-and so there be doubtless; but Mrs. Glass,&#xD;
in her renowned cookery book, ere she begins to&#xD;
expatiate upon cooking the individual of the finny&#xD;
tribe upon which you mean to gratify your refined&#xD;
and luxurious appetite, says: "First catch your&#xD;
fi~~*~) Here was a thought for me that saddened&#xD;
my steps. "These women," said I to myself&#xD;
"what enigmas they are. This Miss Singleton is&#xD;
a magnificent girl-I wonder if I could please her.&#xD;
Whyshe must be a little in for it with Sangston;"&#xD;
and then, in such an event, for the first time the&#xD;
great alteration which would take place in the Poor&#xD;
fellow's earthly condition in bed and board occurred&#xD;
to me in its full force, and I hastened to find him&#xD;
and fulfil my errand.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXI~&#xD;
I FIND SANOBTON-HIS RELIEF.-REFLECTIONS UPOkJ&#xD;
WHAT MISS SINGLETON SAID-REGSETS-ThE STIRR-&#xD;

DREAM-SANG-TI'S COMES TO ME WITH A NOTE FRM&#xD;
MISS SINGLETON-ALICE CLARE iN WASIIINGTOW-I&#xD;
MEET HER-MISS UPTON.&#xD;
On inquiry, I found that Sangston had been dis-&#xD;
3ipating all the week, and was then sick at the&#xD;
bachelor establishment of some of his friends-a&#xD;
number of young officials. Woro and wan and&#xD;
wasted, I found him in bed, agonized at his condi-&#xD;
tion and foil of remorse for his conduct. I did my&#xD;
best to cheer him, asked him what the news was,&#xD;
and, quick as thought, he ordered the boy to go to&#xD;
the post office, observing, "Maybe th~ re's a letter&#xD;
for me. A man in my condition is al~a3s appre-&#xD;
hending that something has happened to him and&#xD;
wishes to know the worst."&#xD;
The letter came. So overjoyed was Sangston,&#xD;
that he leaped from his bed, and, without scarcely&#xD;
saying a word to me, except to mention that a debt&#xD;
had been paid him, which was a great relief in his&#xD;
present condition, he asked me to excuse him,&#xD;
and hurriedly departed, shaking all over with ner-&#xD;
vous anxiety to be a~ay.&#xD;
Poor fellow! I thought, I ought to say something&#xD;
to him, but in his then condition I reflected it would&#xD;
be of no use-and especially as his mind appeared&#xD;
tobe absorbed in the one idea of the "relief" which&#xD;
the reception of the money had given him. After&#xD;
he left, and I sat alone in the bachelor apartment&#xD;
of the luxurious young officials of the "Hall," who&#xD;
were at their duties or elsewhere, it occurred to&#xD;
me that he might be infatuated with the idea that&#xD;
as he had had one streak of luck in receiving the&#xD;
money, that Fortune, the jade, was now at last&#xD;
about to take his side, and he had gone to a gaming&#xD;
house.&#xD;
I entered the street, and learned from a mutual&#xD;
acquaintance that Sangston had gone home. Re-&#xD;
lieved in my mind, I returned to my hotel, and&#xD;
found an invitation to dino witji a "mess" of South-&#xD;
ern members, who were all quartering together. At&#xD;
the appointed hour I went.&#xD;
What Miss Singleton had said to me about my&#xD;
wasting my energies and talents in frivolities had&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC8021-00000045"/>&#xD;
90&#xD;
&#xD;
made a deep impression on me. Every moment&#xD;
when I was n~t thinking of Sangston her remarks&#xD;
were in my mind; and when I thought of Alice&#xD;
Clare, I had the feeling that should I win high&#xD;
position, she would surely and willingly and proud-&#xD;
ly be mine.&#xD;
Ambition, a giant in my nature, that had been&#xD;
slumbering for years, began to stir me to nobler ef-&#xD;
foits than that of histrionic representations or tri-&#xD;
umphs in socie:y. Oh! I began to think now most&#xD;
seriously of what Moore has said of his own gifts:&#xD;
"'1~aients made&#xD;
Hap'ly for pure and high designs,&#xD;
But oft, like Israel's incense, laid&#xD;
Upon unholy earthly shrines."&#xD;
and thought how natural it was for the idle and the&#xD;
voluptuous Ciesar, the "loose girdled boyS~ to&#xD;
&#xD;
don me, dear reader, but the "spilt milk" of the&#xD;
past-the recollection of misspent hours, to say no-&#xD;
thing of vicious ones-how they haunted me. I&#xD;
felt myself in the ac omplishments of the speaker,&#xD;
in the outward graces, and even in the gifts of&#xD;
language and illustration and adornment, to be in-&#xD;
finitely superior to many of the men around me&#xD;
who had won famous positions as politicians, law-&#xD;
yers and statesmen-and here, I thought, am I, as&#xD;
idler-and worse, nut even trying to win the only&#xD;
woman I have ever deeply loved, so as to secure&#xD;
myself domestic enjoyment and happiness, though&#xD;
I have no other.&#xD;
How these revulsion of feeling pressed upon&#xD;
my brain arid he;;rt as I trod the avenue and hur-&#xD;
ried to the Capitol to listen to one of those stirring&#xD;
debates which the nullification movements of some&#xD;
of the Southern States was then arousing, and in&#xD;
&#xD;
weep over the victories of Alexander. who, at his j which the champion of South Carolina stood alone&#xD;
&#xD;
age, had accomplished empire, when he had ac-&#xD;
complishied nothing but debts which he could not&#xD;
pay.&#xD;
Often and often had these reflections flashed over&#xD;
my mind like a dark cloud, and as often did I dis-&#xD;
pel them by plunging into society, and flattering&#xD;
myself that I was playing the epicurean philoso-&#xD;
pher, and carrying out the true aims of life by liv-&#xD;
ing according to the saying, "While we live let us&#xD;
live."&#xD;
Mingling infmately with the stirring politicians&#xD;
and statesmen about me, and flattered by many of&#xD;
them for the eclat which I had in refined society,&#xD;
a matter which some of them did not understand&#xD;
and all men more or less envy, and particularly men&#xD;
of the world,! at first mistook my position for one (if&#xD;
real importance to more than the mere butterflies of&#xD;
fashion and excitement which a winter in Wash-&#xD;
ington never fails to bring together. But itarinoy-&#xD;
ed rae deeply, and the annoyance Qhough not on-&#xD;
mixed wit Ii a certain gratification) struck still deep-&#xD;
er when not only the men but the women told me&#xD;
that I was wasting my talents. I began to find&#xD;
out that the very idlest and most fashionable of the&#xD;
women themselves would appreciate me more; in-&#xD;
finitely more indeed, did I hold the same rank in&#xD;
the s'ri~e of men in the sterner struggles of life&#xD;
which I he'd in the drawing room a rid the saloon.&#xD;
Ahi how I began to curse say wasted hours! Par-&#xD;
&#xD;
like Ivanhoe in the lists at Ashby, with no Black&#xD;
sluggard to cry to the rescue.&#xD;
I should nor be particular in dates were they all&#xD;
before me, when, indeed, I have no memory for&#xD;
them, as I tell stern truths in my reminiscences,&#xD;
that might offend; l.'et I well remember the keen&#xD;
encounters between Mr. Webster and more than&#xD;
one of the southerners, and although my heart&#xD;
went in many things with the nullifiers, I must say&#xD;
that my convictions went then, as they go now,&#xD;
with the Union, heart and soul, whenever that&#xD;
question was touched upon in debate. Chataufiri&#xD;
and says in his memoirs, that although he was a&#xD;
Bourbonist and hated Napoleon, yet, when he heard&#xD;
the thunder of the allied armies at Waterloo&#xD;
piercing his retirement, that after listening to the&#xD;
contending hosts for awhile, his love for France&#xD;
prevailed and he could not but pray that her sons&#xD;
night triumph let who would lead them At first&#xD;
I had sonic sich feelings as these, yet I always&#xD;
looked upon tile Union as such a sacred institution,&#xD;
that it was her bravery and prowess rather than&#xD;
her supposed or real injuries which made me&#xD;
t)f ten, at least in the badinage of conversatit)n, side&#xD;
with Soulla Carolina as to her right to secede.&#xD;
Yes, I began indeed to feel that amy life was&#xD;
"idleness alt;~~ and more than once I found myself&#xD;
wide and restlessly awake in the dearest hour of&#xD;
the night, alternately reprox~hing myself for throw~&#xD;
&#xD;
ing away my time, or forming some scheme of&#xD;
study and ambition. Yes, I said, I must break this&#xD;
thraldom of society and dissipation which surrounds&#xD;
rae-I must act, act-do something-and I must&#xD;
devote myself to hard study.&#xD;
If I had been desperately poor, and poverty had&#xD;
been pressing me on with this necessity as well as&#xD;
a feverish and I began to fear morbid ambition, how&#xD;
soon I should have seized the oar-and for a good&#xD;
reason, tor it then would have been a struggle for&#xD;
life as well as for fame.&#xD;
But as it was, in these alternations of feeling,&#xD;
made the more turbid by my thoughts of Alice&#xD;
Clare, I gave myself up too often to wild company&#xD;
and late hours, and had, of course, to suffer all the&#xD;
pangs of consequent physical wretchedness and re-&#xD;
morse.&#xD;
I am among the breakers yet, rho~ght I, as one&#xD;
day I flung myself on my horse and galloped to-&#xD;
wards Bladensburg to see my old landlord there,&#xD;
and spend a day or two away from the excitement&#xD;
of the city and recruit a little, for I was really&#xD;
worn out and sick. Yes, I am among the breakers&#xD;
yet-I live without an object in life, and I shall be&#xD;
a wreck if I do not have an object-for be the day&#xD;
ever so bright and the sky ever so clear, whither&#xD;
am I steering, whither am I steering-the cloud&#xD;
must come at last, arid what aim have I, what ob-&#xD;
ject? where is my port?&#xD;
With head ache and heart ache, I reached the&#xD;
Bladensburg hotel, and asking for a room, I threw&#xD;
myself upon the bed, and was soon in a wild and&#xD;
dreamy sleep.&#xD;
The agony of that dream I remember now. I&#xD;
saw Alice Clare walking arm in arm with Peter-&#xD;
son. I said to myself, why do you idle away your&#xD;
time here-hir in my dream I seemed to recognize&#xD;
the facts of my oWn position just as they were-&#xD;
when your heart's hope is at stake. Oh! what an&#xD;
agony was it for me to feel that she had a prefer-&#xD;
ence fo0r L1eterson! I thought she avowed it to me-&#xD;
[thought, while she was walking with him, she&#xD;
avowed it to me-it seemed to me th~r her look&#xD;
had a voice, an audible voice, and told it to me.-&#xD;
I gazed at Peterson, and thought I saw his look of&#xD;
triumph, a~ud I writhed in jealous madness as I&#xD;
thought I saw him press her lip and hold her to&#xD;
his heart, while she, all coynesh gone, looked into&#xD;
&#xD;
91&#xD;
&#xD;
his face and returned his caress with interest! Yes,&#xD;
with interest, I said to myself, so full of an over-&#xD;
flowing fondness is her heart for him. And I have&#xD;
been a fool from my very childhood-a fool. How&#xD;
many stolen hours have they had together that I&#xD;
knew nothing of?&#xD;
I was aroused with a suffocating sensation in my&#xD;
throat. Ha! thought I, this is all a dream;-my&#xD;
neck-cloth was only too tight-"Pray you, undo&#xD;
this button"-in my mad trick of quoting theatri-&#xD;
cals quoting old Lear. And then I threw myself&#xD;
down on my face, with my hands over it, on the bed,&#xD;
while scalding and big tears came to my relief, and&#xD;
trickled through my fingers. Resolve me this&#xD;
again, ye who have skill in these matters.&#xD;
I was aroused from my burst of emotion by a&#xD;
rap at my door. The broad red sun was just set-&#xD;
ting, and it had been shining in my face. That,&#xD;
with my buttoned collar, had as much to do ~rirh&#xD;
my dream, maybe, as anything else. There is no&#xD;
telling-I have puzzled over such things often, but&#xD;
could never make anything out of them after all.&#xD;
Yet a kind of superstition within us tells us that&#xD;
the "stuff" they are made of has something of&#xD;
life's hues and mortal destiny in them, in spite of&#xD;
the poet 'a reasoning:&#xD;
are but interludes which Fancy makes;&#xD;
IV lion nionarch reason sleeps this mimic wakes,&#xD;
)ontounds a medley of' disjointed things,&#xD;
I~ court of' coblee; cud a mob or kings."&#xD;
"Is [lot the past all shadow?" says a less reason-&#xD;
ing but not less imaginative poet. Yes, but can&#xD;
the future be foreshadowed? or have our dreams&#xD;
anything to do with realities except that they are&#xD;
the objectless vagaries born of them? But as I was&#xD;
saying, I was interrupted by a rap at my door. I&#xD;
called out, as I took rime to recover myself-&#xD;
"in (me moment-who's that?"&#xD;
And the voice of Sangston cheerfully sounded in&#xD;
reply: "'Tis I, Hamlet the Dane."&#xD;
In a moment more I flung the door open, and&#xD;
shook Sangston cordially by the hand. He looked&#xD;
a little worn, but his smile had no sadness in it.&#xD;
"I have," he explained, "a missive for you from&#xD;
Miss Singleton, who bids you to a partV to-night,&#xD;
and she bade me find you arid deliver h in person.&#xD;

&#xD;
knowing when you would return, I have speeded&#xD;
to fulfil Miss Singleton's commands. Here is her&#xD;
note."&#xD;
I broke the seal and read:&#xD;
Ma. RtrssaLL:-As you have more than once&#xD;
announced that you owe your allegiance to Caroli-&#xD;
na, and particularly to her representative, ourself,&#xD;
therefore be it known to you, that you are bidden&#xD;
to-night to present yourself at our rooms, that you&#xD;
may meet there a lady of the Monumental City,&#xD;
not unknown to you-Miss Alice Clare-to whom&#xD;
you have been recreant, if report says true, and to&#xD;
whom we now give you an opportunity to present&#xD;
yourself at a meeting of our mutual friends to be&#xD;
holden in our parlor to-night. Itis proper for us&#xD;
to saythat we have not told the lady of our inten-&#xD;
tion to bid you to our presence; so you may fashion&#xD;
for yourself your own mode of presenting yourself&#xD;
to her-an opportunity which, maybe, her know-&#xD;
ledge of your coming would not give you. We&#xD;
have hopes that our indiscretion will not shatter&#xD;
into fragments your flinty and false heart-and if&#xD;
it does, Miss Upton and other ladies that you and&#xD;
we know of, ourselves of course being omitted in&#xD;
the mention, shall do their best, under our com-&#xD;
mands, to gather together the fragments and so to&#xD;
reunite them that they shall be broken never again,&#xD;
at least by the same person.&#xD;
Given under our hand and seal, this - day&#xD;
of --                  SALLIE S1NGLETOr~.&#xD;
By our trusty and well beloved messenger Hen~.&#xD;
ry Sangston-&#xD;
I read and re-read the note, while Sangeton&#xD;
amused himself with brushing the dust from his&#xD;
clothes with a whisp which he had taker1 from the&#xD;
table.&#xD;
"Alice Clare in Washington!" I said to myself,&#xD;
"and what of W?-is Washington so very far frem&#xD;
Baltimore-but a few hour's ride, and I months in~&#xD;
Washington without seeking once to see her! But&#xD;
we have quarrelled-at least we parted coldly.-&#xD;
What could have brought her here?" As I asked&#xD;
n~yself this question I turned to Sangaton and en-&#xD;
quired:&#xD;
"When did Miss Clare come to Washington,&#xD;
Sangston?~~&#xD;
"The day before yesterday."&#xD;
"Where is she?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"At my ~&#xD;
"Who's with her'?"&#xD;
"Two or ,three ladies-they have come to Mrs.&#xD;
P-'s party."&#xD;
"Any gentlemen?"&#xD;
"Yes: a Mr. Peterson and Mr. J~mper.~~&#xD;
"Peterson! Perterson! What kind of a looking&#xD;
fellow is he?"&#xD;
"0! he's all the go with the women-he's a&#xD;
first rate looking fellow-he knows you-..-I heard&#xD;
him talking with Miss Clare about you, and regret&#xD;
you were so wild."&#xD;
"Regret I was so wild?"&#xD;
"Yes, he said it, for I heard him. Miss Single-&#xD;
ton joked Miss Clare about you, hut she made no&#xD;
reply. She drew on her gloves and went sailing&#xD;
down the avenue yesterday afternoon; didn't you&#xD;
see them?"&#xD;
"See them! No, I was in Alexandria. Where&#xD;
do they stop?"&#xD;
"At my mother's. Faith, I don't in fact un-&#xD;
derstand hese women, at least those who think&#xD;
the most of themselves; but I tell you Russell, she&#xD;
is very sweet on Mr. Peterson. You should have&#xD;
seen them yesterday afternoon walking down the'&#xD;
broad avenue-the whole crowd gazed after them&#xD;
in ad~riiration-they were considered the hand-&#xD;
somest couple in Washington."&#xD;
'ro cool the pressure on ~my brain of conflicting&#xD;
passions and hot blood, for it seemed, as 1 lifted a&#xD;
glass of water to my lips, to be bursting with its&#xD;
load of agonizing reflections-aroused jealousy and&#xD;
unrequited love,.-.-I plunged my head into a basin&#xD;
of water, and laved tiiy brow and chest before I&#xD;
suffered myself to say a word.&#xD;
"Yes! and he was sweet upon her, you say?~~&#xD;
"Indeed he was. Ye little fishes! hut Russell,&#xD;
she is beautiful [tell you now; she slew the fel-&#xD;
lows right and loft as she walked down the avenue.&#xD;
And she kept a keen look out-maybe she was&#xD;
looking for you. I have heard Miss Singleton jest&#xD;
you about her; and that-yes, this is the very lady&#xD;
~-.and that she understood she liked you. It was&#xD;
on account of this very lady she called you a gay&#xD;
Lothario, was it not?"&#xD;
"Not that I remember. What! do you mean to&#xD;
say that she looked about, looked around, as if she&#xD;
was looking for some one?"&#xD;
&#xD;
WILLIAM&#xD;
"No-but every body was looking at hex4~, that's&#xD;
certain, and she could not be unconscious of it.-&#xD;
How she laughed and chatted with that Mr. Peter-&#xD;
son. But he's a fine looking fellow. Russell, he's&#xD;
older than you-he would give his two eyes for&#xD;
her. These women, for the soul of me, 1 can't&#xD;
understand them."&#xD;
&#xD;
"They don't understand themselves" I exclaim- with a certain stiff-necked puritanical kind of pre-&#xD;
&#xD;
ed~ with an additional phrase which it is not ne-&#xD;
cessary to repeat. "They don't understand them-&#xD;
selves, or wont. And as for their constancy and&#xD;
truthfulness-I don't believe they know the mean-&#xD;
ing of the words, unless they see it illustrated in&#xD;
the lives of their lovers. Coquetry and deceit they&#xD;
understand though.~~&#xD;
"Why, Russell, is this your opinion of women?"&#xD;
I remained silent, and Sangston continued:&#xD;
"I tell you what it is, in my opinion there is no~&#xD;
judging of women at all-no knowing what they&#xD;
do. Russell, I want to have a talk with you to-&#xD;
night after the party."&#xD;
"Agreed, agreed,~~ said I. Come, let's to horse."&#xD;
"Let's drink 5o~~thing,~~ said Sangston, as we&#xD;
descended to the bar-room, and eur horses were&#xD;
brought out to our orders.&#xD;
"Not a drop, not a drop,~~ I exclaimed.&#xD;
I thought of what Peterson had said of my dis-&#xD;
sipated habits. and the desire to drink was crushed&#xD;
in me as you would crush a serpentA~as you would&#xD;
strike life out of it with your heel.&#xD;
"Yes," thought I to myself, as we pitt spur to&#xD;
our horses and darted ahead side by side in silence,&#xD;
each occupied with his own thoughts-~Sangston&#xD;
thinking of Miss Singleton and I of Alice Clare-&#xD;
"Yes, Mr. Peterson, I flung you once sky high.&#xD;
when I was a tx~y-yes, "Willie Russell" did,&#xD;
"Mr. Peterson"-and why cannot he do it again?&#xD;
0! 1 was a fresh-lipped innocent boy then-what&#xD;
am I now? But what if I am changed; the change&#xD;
has been the change to knowledge if it has been to&#xD;
sin-and why may I not win her yet?"&#xD;
Here my thoughts took wildest flight, and I&#xD;
thought of all that had ever passed between Alice&#xD;
and myself, and the suspicion haunted me that I had&#xD;
fatally fooled away the greatest chance of being&#xD;
most blest in a beautiful wojnan's love that ever a&#xD;
man had; and oh the bitterness of the self-reproach&#xD;
that seemed like fiery serpents to coil about my'&#xD;
&#xD;
vision which held me just so in collar and neck-&#xD;
cloth, and which annoyed me exceedingly. How&#xD;
these little matters put one out! and, when great&#xD;
matters have already tost us into a tempest, how&#xD;
we strive to give vent to these feelings in this&#xD;
shallow brook of little things which overflows it.&#xD;
self and shows how deeply our souls are moved,&#xD;
and that these minor matters are b~t straws.&#xD;
Worn and experienced as 1 had been of late in&#xD;
fashionable parties, I thought the fashionable hour,&#xD;
(9 o'clock) for going would never come; and when&#xD;
it did come, I thought what a flurry I was in, and&#xD;
wondered it had come so soon! These confessions&#xD;
may seem strange, but they are true; and a person&#xD;
of calm and quiet temperament cannot, maybe, un-&#xD;
derstand why I should have been so moved,-but&#xD;
those of the more fiery clay will understand all&#xD;
about it. But to the party.&#xD;
As I approached the lodgings of Miss Singleton,&#xD;
in the hack which I had ordered, I saw . the house&#xD;
all lighted up, and a crowd of carriages were be-&#xD;
fore the door and some distance beyond it, waiting&#xD;
their turn to be delivered of their burdens. My&#xD;
impatience would tiot let me wait, so I alighted,.&#xD;
and proceeded to Mrs. Sang~ton~s front door. lust&#xD;
as I reached it a coachman was hurriedly throwing&#xD;
down the steps of his vehicle, and a gentleman de.&#xD;
ascended therefrom whom I instantly recognized to&#xD;
be Peterson. A laughing voice within said merri-&#xD;
ly-oh, how that light tone brought sorrow to my&#xD;
heart-&#xD;
"Be not in such a hurry, driver;-for mercy's&#xD;
sake, Mr. Peterson, give me your attention; Miss&#xD;
Upton has not come yet, and Miss Singleton can&#xD;
be seen all the evening. I declare, I have got my&#xD;
dress entangled in these odious steps."&#xD;
"Go ahead!" shouted out the driver of the car-&#xD;
riage immediately behind that of'Peterson's; "what&#xD;
are you blocking up the way for?"&#xD;
"Wait a motqent," e~c~aimed Peterson, ttirning to&#xD;
&#xD;
RUSSELL.                                 93&#xD;
he~rt and knot and gender there with passions that&#xD;
Were maddening.&#xD;
I never was fastidious in tile adjustment of my&#xD;
toilette, but I certainly expended more than my&#xD;
usual care upon it, and my hand was tremulous&#xD;
with emotion as I arranged and re-arranged differ-&#xD;
ent portions of my dress, and found particular fault&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC8021-00000047"/>&#xD;
~94&#xD;
&#xD;
the map, who, seated on his coach-box, was crack&#xD;
ing his whip impatiently. A~ he turned, the horse~&#xD;
in his carriage pranced wildly, and Alice at rh~&#xD;
same moment made a step down. She missed&#xD;
catching his hand which was held out to her, with&#xD;
his head turned towards the carriage behind, and&#xD;
she would have been thrown on her face on the&#xD;
pavement had I not sprang to her assistance and&#xD;
caught her completely in my arms as she fell heav-&#xD;
ily towards me.&#xD;
£ forgot everything but that it was "my beauti-&#xD;
ful my own" Alice Clare whom I had caught in&#xD;
my arms; and as her calash fell from her brow and&#xD;
her shawl from her dazzling shoulders, which, in&#xD;
the low drees for the evening, threw back the lights&#xD;
like glittering marble, I pressed her to my heart&#xD;
and felt that I at least then possessed her, if but for&#xD;
a moment, in spite of Mr. Peterson.&#xD;
"That person has insulted me!" exclaimed&#xD;
Alice, springing away from me-and at this in&#xD;
slant, as we stood full in the~blaze of the light from&#xD;
the front door, we all recognized each other, ~nd&#xD;
Alice exclaimed&#xD;
"William Russell!"&#xD;
"William Russell," I said, "is incapable of in-&#xD;
suIting any lady, and is answerable to any gentle-&#xD;
man in the premises!"&#xD;
Alice half raised her hand I thought, perchance&#xD;
to shake hands with me; but Peterson took it,&#xD;
placed it under his arm, and taking her calash and&#xD;
shawl from the driver, who had picked them up,&#xD;
they entered the house.&#xD;
I stood on the spot for some moments, with a&#xD;
glow of impulses strangely mixed, and I wished&#xD;
from my soul that Peterson would take it up. "Ha!&#xD;
perhaps," I said to myself, "Alice, for sake of his&#xD;
safety, not for mine, may make him promise not to&#xD;
notice my remark, and he will save his courage&#xD;
and his carcass together."&#xD;
Just then the next carriage drove up, and Miss&#xD;
Upton called out;&#xD;
"Is that you, Mr. Russell'? And whe was the&#xD;
lady whom you caught so tenderly in your arms?&#xD;
I was looking at you! I fear my impatience in&#xD;
telling my driver ~o make haste caused her some&#xD;
inconvenience, though your natural gallantry cer-&#xD;
tainly availed yourself of it-her little misstep.-&#xD;
You gentlemen always avail yourselves of our&#xD;
&#xD;
- missteps!" and she laughed knowingly and mis-&#xD;
s chievously.&#xD;
"Po you speak from experience, Miss Upton?"&#xD;
I could not but enquirer.&#xD;
"Oh! you rude creature-no! How many mtre&#xD;
I ladies do you mean to insult to-night, sir? Wait,&#xD;
driver; let the persons behind wait-yoi see what&#xD;
has arisen already from over haste. It is a pity,&#xD;
Mr. Russell~ that you could not do with the lady&#xD;
what the sailor did with the one who was crossing&#xD;
the muddy street, and whom he picked up and&#xD;
carried over: 'Oh! you rude brute,' she exclaimed,&#xD;
'let me alone!' 'Certainly, madam,' he replied;&#xD;
and he bore her back again, and placed her where&#xD;
he found her."&#xD;
"I would willingly bear her back again for the&#xD;
sake of the burden, and return with her again and&#xD;
again, like the repetition of Juliet's "good night,"&#xD;
I replied.&#xD;
"You most extravagant inns, you," exclaimed&#xD;
Miss Upton, laughing heartily: "The girls must&#xD;
vote you a medal made from the fragments ef the&#xD;
broken hearts which your-compliments have shat-&#xD;
tered, and each of them must contribute a lock of&#xD;
hair wherewith you may wear it gracefully round&#xD;
your neck and next your heart."&#xD;
Her sarcastic and ringing laugh stung me a lit-&#xD;
tIe, but I called dandyism and nonchalance to my&#xD;
aid, and said:&#xD;
"That would be a cruelty-I should be killed&#xD;
by the quantity,-smorhered by i~he weight of&#xD;
the medal and the hair, as Tarpeia was by the&#xD;
jewelry of the soldiery. Will you contribute?"&#xD;
The lady had, in the meanwhile, in the most&#xD;
leisurely way, descended from her carriage and&#xD;
halted on the pavement by the side 6f the gentle.&#xD;
man who attended her, whom I did not recognize.&#xD;
In the meanwhile, the carriage behind discharge!.'&#xD;
three gentlemen, and she turned to them and said:'&#xD;
"Am I not as impartial as justice herself? If&#xD;
there had only been two of you gentlemen, you&#xD;
should have ridden with me; but there being three,&#xD;
and I not having had the pleasure of your acqunin.&#xD;
tance until this evening, I could not tell whose de-&#xD;
votion entitled him to a preference, ~e-l repeat, I&#xD;
had to bid you all to Miss Singleton's party, and&#xD;
treat you all alike. I have a carte blanche from&#xD;
iVliss Singleton to invite whom 11 will-and 1 shall&#xD;

make a sensation in your presentation to the great-&#xD;
est heiress and beauty of the South. Come," she&#xD;
continued, ascending the steps, surrounded by the&#xD;
strangers,,for such I took them to be: "Coiitrib&#xD;
tile!" she exclaimed, turning to me, "Oh! yes, I&#xD;
would contribute, but no~ to your vanity. My lock&#xD;
should go to make a chain of another character, you&#xD;
false one-it would vulgarly be called a rope-and&#xD;
you merit a hempen one, you traitor to true hearts! ~&#xD;
And'she disengaged herself from the gentlemen,&#xD;
and tripping up to rue she whispered, "Why have&#xD;
you not been to see me? Miss Clare will be here&#xD;
to-night;" and again joining the group of gentle-&#xD;
men; she entered the hall.&#xD;
"Well," thought I, as I compressed my lips.&#xD;
half in wrath and half in vanity, "How matters&#xD;
and things are misunderstood in this world." Yet&#xD;
do I confess it, the misunderstanding of matters and&#xD;
things relative to myself gave a spur to my pride&#xD;
and a momentary gaiety to my spirit, which, like&#xD;
the stimulus of alcohol, I feared and in part felt,&#xD;
could not be kept up; but which made me drink&#xD;
the deeper of the 'draught, nevertheless;-and so I&#xD;
too entered the brilliant assemblage, where, I doubt&#xD;
not, there were more mashers than one.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
AM STOTFED BY TUE CROWD-MY OTERA 0A1'-CoNVER-&#xD;
SATION WITH MR. DUDLEY ABOUT MISS SINGLETON-&#xD;
WE GO INTO TEE STREET-MRS. COMMODoRE DIXLEY-&#xD;
I MEET MR. JEMES JUMFER--OUR COBVERSATION-&#xD;
NOVEL GROUNDS FOR INSTITUTING A SUIT AT LAW-&#xD;
THE SOCIETY OFVIASHiNGTON.&#xD;
The crowd was so great within that it was with&#xD;
difficulty one could make any headway whatever.&#xD;
It was a perfect squeeze-a jam. I asked where&#xD;
Miss Singleton was, and was informed that the far-&#xD;
thestroom held the cynosure of the evening. I4ook-&#xD;
ed around for Miss Upton; but, with that ready tact&#xD;
for which she was remarkable, she had made the&#xD;
crowd give way to her and her attendants, and she&#xD;
had, doubtless, already reached the inner sanctua-&#xD;
ry.&#xD;
I stood twirling about my opera Cal) and glancing&#xD;
13&#xD;
&#xD;
RUSSELL.                                95&#xD;
at my gloves, in the most nonchalent way imagi-&#xD;
nable, but it was merely exciteau3flt letting o2~&#xD;
steam, and pretending to be perfectly up to things,&#xD;
and too patrician to be annoyed by such matters.&#xD;
My opera cap, by the by, let me say, was a&#xD;
"thing of beauty." It was fashioned by the deli-&#xD;
cate hand of Miss Singleton herself, audi presented&#xD;
to me as a token of her regard and recognition of&#xD;
me as a South Carolinian. It was of beautiful&#xD;
black velvet, with the Palmetto wrought on it in&#xD;
gold, and a single star rising over it in glittering&#xD;
silver. Proud was I of that opera cap, for not a&#xD;
man in Washington, and I was not slow to believe&#xD;
in the wide world, could boast of a similar favor&#xD;
from her fair hand. It touched my pride of heart&#xD;
too deeply to talk about, but as the "fellows" ad-~&#xD;
mired it, who were waiting entrance like myself,&#xD;
it was a delight of mine to answer their eager in-&#xD;
quiries as to where I got it in a way that had an&#xD;
histrionic effect in it, from which I have thought&#xD;
the happiest producer of "points" might catch a&#xD;
hint.&#xD;
"Miss Singleton made it for me."&#xD;
"What! the 'Carolina star~~your fair representa-&#xD;
tive, as you call her, Russell?" said the Honorable&#xD;
Mr. Dudley.&#xD;
"Where did she get it? It is beautiful."&#xD;
"Get it? Miss Singleton made and presented&#xD;
it to me," I replied, holding it carelessly in my&#xD;
hand, almost a~ if it would fall from it, and yet as&#xD;
firmly and as dearly as 1 held my heart's blood.&#xD;
"You are a lucky fellow, Russell."&#xD;
"Men have so accounted me, Mr. Dudley, more&#xD;
than once-yet,. if put upon my oath," I said, and&#xD;
here I spoke from my heart, "I do not know that&#xD;
I should so account myself."&#xD;
The calm Englishman, who had seen the best&#xD;
society of the world, and who, doubtless, had ex-&#xD;
perienced the play and the storm of the passions,&#xD;
looked at me with a quiet smile, that had a sly&#xD;
meaning in i~, I thought, and said:&#xD;
"Every heart knoweth its own bitterness." ~&#xD;
Not expecting such a reply, I felt myself blush&#xD;
for the moment, knowing the "bitterness" of mine,&#xD;
and said&#xD;
"True, sir. A lady's favors are sometimes like&#xD;
a child's gifts, given and taken back again."&#xD;

"Yes," replied the Englishman, "but Miss Sin- Woman, who, by the by, had made a great pet and&#xD;

The Englishman fixed his eye for a moment, keen air strike my brow and chest, while I wrestled&#xD;
and said:                                    with the wild emotions that were throbbing at my&#xD;
"Your gay and beautiful friend, Miss IJptonjust heart. Just at this time, with a whistle, skip and&#xD;
passed in. She reminds me a great deal of more jump, who should come bolt round the corner but&#xD;

"Do tell me," I said, speaking apart to Mr. gleton's.&#xD;

and Lord Lightner.~I                          who  he Jiad' so unceremoniously encountered,&#xD;
Re took my arm and we walked to the ~treet&#xD;
door together. He remarked:                   thinking, perhaps, of another affair of'honor, when&#xD;
I burst into a laugh, and exclaimed,&#xD;
"What a crowd-one will scarcely he able to "Jumper! my old friend!"&#xD;
get in."                                       "Ah! Russell !-how do you do?-'pon my word&#xD;
"Yes," I replied, "but there is a party at the I am glad to see you."&#xD;
Secretary of the Treasury's to-night, and soon the "No more glad than I am."&#xD;
politicians, M. C.'s and strangers will flock there." "Infernal disagreeable circumstances these, to&#xD;
"I never enjoyed these squeezes much, yet a man spring out of nothing-gad, I got thin on it-only&#xD;

We according stepped into the street. It was "Yes, so am 1. This fat is'nt very intellectual,&#xD;
a clear, bracing night, and the bright stars above is it Russell?"&#xD;
looked in calmness down upon the busy' streets, "Not very; though 'Webster is fat."&#xD;

Clare is to marry Peterson?"                  in&#xD;
"I don't know."&#xD;
"What do you think about it Jumper?"&#xD;
"Me! I think! I confess my utter ignorance of ~z&#xD;
women! He's always with her, at any rate-and&#xD;
if she don't mean to accept him I don't see why ai&#xD;
she should accept his attentions-but that's just&#xD;
the way with these women, Russell. You know h&#xD;
how I took to Jane Bradley? Well, it was a mis- if&#xD;
take, that's all. She never took to me, though a&#xD;
she took me in! It cost me four hundred dollars a&#xD;
running moufld to the springs with her and I don't&#xD;
know what all; and hang me if she ever even in- li&#xD;
vited me to her wedding when she married old a&#xD;
Post;-the most preposterous thing I ever heard of. a&#xD;
I tell you what it is-I have consulted counsel e&#xD;
about suing her-recovering back that money s&#xD;
which she got me to spend under false pretences." i&#xD;
I burst into a laugh.&#xD;
"By gracious it's a fact-under false pretences 1&#xD;
-under the pretence of receiving my attentions,&#xD;
and then flinging me high and dry. I can't afford&#xD;
to lose the money, Russell. I believe I could re-&#xD;
cover it, though she is a ferne concert, as you call&#xD;
it-could'nt I?"&#xD;
"I'm no lawyer," I replied; "I can't tell;~~ and&#xD;
[laughed heartily. "How came you to be all\&#xD;
alone, walking to the paxty?"&#xD;
"Why, Peterson was engaged to attend Miss&#xD;
Clare, and he did'nt want any body with him of&#xD;
course, you know, and I never interfere. The fact&#xD;
is that my face is awfully flushed, and I thought&#xD;
I'd get the redness out of it by walking in the open&#xD;
air. Russell, it is actually awful to have one of&#xD;
your flushing faces-it is a providential visitation."&#xD;
"It is a wino and brandy visitation you mean,"&#xD;
1 replied.&#xD;
"No,. I assure you not. I scarcely ever take any&#xD;
thing now-a-days. To be sure my face is a little&#xD;
flushed here in Washington, but it is the change&#xD;
of climate! "'&#xD;
Change of climate between this and Baltimore!&#xD;
It's a change of drinks, from three or four to a do-&#xD;
zen."&#xD;
"Well, suppose we step in here and take some-&#xD;
thing."&#xD;
&#xD;
97&#xD;
&#xD;
"Not a drop. 1 know enough to know that, to&#xD;
man of ray temperament, it is a deadly poison-&#xD;
fact that it would soon put rue in a mad ~&#xD;
"Why, you~re changed.~~&#xD;
"Changed-yes. Jumper, I have. I've done&#xD;
itli loving my enemies-"&#xD;
"Russell, you always knew I was your friend,&#xD;
3d I'm glad you've quit-you should do so."&#xD;
I could not but smile at Jumper, who evidently&#xD;
ad no intention of quitting himself. But so it is&#xD;
ithis world; we can all see over our own faults&#xD;
nd vices most distinctly the vices and faults of&#xD;
ur friends.&#xD;
"Yes," said I to myself, as I walked to and fro, -&#xD;
olding Jumper's arm, while the fresh, keen, night&#xD;
ir cooled my excited frame, "Yes, I have been a&#xD;
l~jve of passion and the follower of frivolities long&#xD;
nough. My histrionic mania and consequent dis-&#xD;
ipation nearly wrecked me-and here, in Wash-&#xD;
ngton, my vanity and indulgences have brought&#xD;
ne nothing but remorse; while men, and women&#xD;
oo, wonder why William Russell does not achieve&#xD;
something for himself besides the hollow applause&#xD;
3f mere butterfly worldlings whom he despises.-&#xD;
Oh! if Alice Clare were only mine, I thought,&#xD;
with her "fair spirit for my minister" and her&#xD;
pure bosom for my pillow', how I should despise&#xD;
and loathe the life I've led, which will not bear&#xD;
the record. Strange, I thought to myself, as we&#xD;
passed to and fro, that Jumper is so silent." And&#xD;
then, as the sound of music came. upon m~ ear&#xD;
from the ball room, I thought that Alice was dan-&#xD;
cing with Peterson, perchance, or telling some one&#xD;
that I insulted bet. No, no, not that; she certain-&#xD;
ly was not angry when she discovered that it was&#xD;
I who caught her. What are you thinking aboUt,&#xD;
Jumper?"&#xD;
"About you, Russell-you have a big reputa-&#xD;
tion here."&#xD;
"Aye!"&#xD;
"Fact, indeed. Miss Singleton took Miss Clare,&#xD;
Peterson and myself to call upon Mrs. Madison.&#xD;
yesterday, and the old lady asked after you,~and&#xD;
said you were the best mannered man in Wash-&#xD;
ington. F-, of Georgia, was by and endor-&#xD;

gifted as you are should live apparently so much&#xD;
without an object."&#xD;

*      "He did--and that quick 'Carolina' girl, Mis&#xD;

water, and flashing her eye on him, asked him&#xD;
he did not think that there were older men ii&#xD;

and worse?"&#xD;
"She did, ha!-~ hurra for 'Carolina!"'&#xD;
"1 tell you, Russell, polished and proud a ma&#xD;

Miss Singleton,~ he said, 'that to win the womar&#xD;

'You had better tell that to Mrs. F .'"&#xD;
"I tell you, Russell, if you were to arouse his&#xD;
Satanic majesty in Miss Singleton's nature she'd&#xD;
break things, and come nullification and disunion&#xD;
on the biggest man in the States."&#xD;
"Yes, I think she would; and I-like her for it."&#xD;
"Do you?~~ exclaimed Jumper in surprise. "I tell&#xD;
you, Russell, you would not like her for it if she&#xD;
was operating on you. She put me in mind of a&#xD;
game chicken, the way she gave it to the old fel-&#xD;
"Certainly," I exclaimed, "your similies are&#xD;
curious if not various or select. First, Miss Sin-&#xD;
gleton arched her neck like a swan, and then she&#xD;
reminded you of a game chicken."&#xD;
"Fact!" exclaimed Jumper; "and hang me if&#xD;
she didn't look like a blooded horse-a young fil-&#xD;
ly!"&#xD;
"Ha! ha! Do you know that the word 'filly'&#xD;
has various meanings-and among others means a&#xD;
wanton and a flirt?"&#xD;
"No! Does it?"&#xD;
"It does; and I ask you to reflect what the result&#xD;
would be should Miss Singleton or some of her hot&#xD;
southern friends heard that you had made such a&#xD;
speech about th~ feireaL flower of the t5outh."&#xD;

BIOGRAPHY OF&#xD;
&#xD;
"Very. They met at the Springs! have heard,&#xD;
s last summer, and they are sworn&#xD;
a "You think Miss Clare has made Miss Single-&#xD;
f ton her confidant, do you?~~&#xD;
"Well, I don't know much what to think about&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"What did Miss Clare say when Mrs Madison&#xD;
and old F--.- were talking about me?"&#xD;
a "Not a word. Miss Singleton spoke up, as I&#xD;
told you, but Miss Clare said not a word- and it&#xD;
surprised me, for I always thought that she was&#xD;
a great friend of yours.~~&#xD;
"Things looked so once."&#xD;
"It's pretty much your own fault, Russell; you&#xD;
- went figuring and flirting away with the Watson,&#xD;
and I don't blame you either for it. Miss Clare&#xD;
came the pie-crust game, that is, she was pretty&#xD;
short with me on that very matter once."&#xD;
"What matter?"&#xD;
"Why you and Miss Watson. When our the-&#xD;
atrical mania first seized us, Miss Watson and you&#xD;
made a deal of talk, and Miss Clare grew furious&#xD;
about it to me one day when I said I thought you&#xD;
liked the Watson."&#xD;
"Ab! did she?"&#xD;
'Well, she did'nt do anything else! She did&#xD;
not speak to me for some time, but as I never heard&#xD;
that she said~any thing about it, you may be as-&#xD;
sured I never said any thing about it myself."&#xD;
"It's a glorious night-how merrily the music&#xD;
sounds-let's go in. 1 judge by this time that&#xD;
many of the M. C.'s and the office seekers have&#xD;
gone to the Secretary's, and we shall find an easier&#xD;
opportunity of presenting ourselves to Miss Single-&#xD;
ton."&#xD;
It W2\S indeed a brilliant assembly. The crowd&#xD;
taken off by the Secretary's party had just thinned&#xD;
enough to give one an opportunity of passing&#xD;
through it with case; and the first l)eople in Wash-&#xD;
ington, strangers and citizens, had congregated&#xD;
there.&#xD;
There a~ something exceedingly attractive in&#xD;
Washington society. It has been very much the&#xD;
fashion with persons who know nothing about it&#xD;
to speak very much against it. And so they should&#xD;
if their judgment of Washington society is formed&#xD;
from an intercourse with its floating population-&#xD;
the host of gamblers,. office seekers, idlers and&#xD;
&#xD;
the other varieties of the genus loafer who congre-&#xD;
gate about the hotels on Pennsylvania avenue and&#xD;
press to all places of public resort. And here, for&#xD;
a moment, I must be allowed to repeat what 1 have&#xD;
said of Washington society, and I speak after an&#xD;
intimate acquaintance with it.&#xD;
A purer, more refined and more sympathizing&#xD;
population than the resident population of Wash-&#xD;
ington, i do not believe exists anywhere in the&#xD;
country. It is the floating population of office hun-&#xD;
tars, gamblers and loafers who have given such an&#xD;
evil name abroad to Washington society. They&#xD;
crowd the streets, hotels, coffee houses, gambling&#xD;
establishments, and if possible, more disreputable&#xD;
abodes, and the careless looker-on takes them for&#xD;
the people of Washington. They on the contrary&#xD;
belong every where through the country, from&#xD;
New Orleans to Maine, from New York to Cali-&#xD;
fornia. If they are claimants, they have to wait&#xD;
the adjustment of their claims, if they are seeking&#xD;
office, they have to wait its bestowment, if they&#xD;
are gamblers they have to wait the report of the&#xD;
stool pigeon, and the presence of their victim, and&#xD;
if they are mere followers of pleasure, they have&#xD;
idle rime enough--so that the recklessness of an&#xD;
uncertain future unprovided for, and the need 0f&#xD;
bread which one does not earn, is rife in Washing-&#xD;
ton. Men go there, for instance, to get an office,&#xD;
with a few dollars in their pockets. They spend&#xD;
their money anyhow, whether they obtain place or&#xD;
not-and if they fail in the attainment of office,&#xD;
too often fall into loaferism, vagabondism, and be-&#xD;
come emphatically "used up." They are Fals-&#xD;
tiff's&#xD;
[ "Cankers of a calm world and a long peace."&#xD;
They are fit to be of the regiment with which he&#xD;
refused to march through Coventry.&#xD;
The observer of human character who visits&#xD;
Washington, and forms his opinion of the place&#xD;
from the population he meets with in the coffee&#xD;
houses, gambling saloons, and about the corners of&#xD;
streets on Pennsylvania avenue, will come to about&#xD;
as just conclusions as would he who made the Five&#xD;
1&#xD;
Points in New York, or the Causeway in Balti-&#xD;
&#xD;
99&#xD;
&#xD;
are residents, and who with very, few exceptions,&#xD;
have nothing to do with office-seeking or this float-&#xD;
ing population, except in the way of business, who&#xD;
should be looked to for the true character of tho&#xD;
place. And I venture to say, a kinder, more coa-&#xD;
&#xD;
siderate, more humane and courteous people cannot&#xD;
be found in our country-they are as religious too,&#xD;
as their many churches and benevolent institutions&#xD;
will bear witness.&#xD;
"The Ladies' Benevolent Society of Washing-&#xD;
ton," which is composed of benevolent ladies from&#xD;
various denominations, and in the most respectable&#xD;
portion of society, proves how year after year those&#xD;
who from position might devote themselves to mere&#xD;
fashion, have devoted themselves to practical be-&#xD;
nevolence.&#xD;
It is said that Congress in its capacity represents&#xD;
the wisdom of the country. Be that as it may.-.-.&#xD;
It is certain that the vices of the country find rep-&#xD;
resentatives in Washington also. And often the&#xD;
more vicious the party, the more inclined they are&#xD;
to seek the focus. Excitement!-Washingron is&#xD;
full of excitemeat, and those who need its stimu-&#xD;
lus, know where to find it.&#xD;
Again, Washington' is like a great hotel to this&#xD;
transient population. They never expect to return&#xD;
to it again, and they use and abuse every thing&#xD;
just as it 'pleases them, from the boarding-house&#xD;
where they lodge to the inmates, if they would&#xD;
suffer it. We venture to say that there are more&#xD;
bad debts owing in Washington to boarding-house&#xD;
keepers. tailors, shop keepers, &amp;amp;c. than ia any other&#xD;
city of its size or travel in the United States.&#xD;
Again, there ~rc citizens of Washington, who,&#xD;
winter after winter, throw opei their houses in the&#xD;
hospitable entertainment of visitors, for which they&#xD;
never receive any return. But I must not enlarge&#xD;
upon this subject, though it is suggestive of a vol-&#xD;
ume.&#xD;
&#xD;
more, the test of the morals of the people. No, it&#xD;
is that portion of the population of Washington who&#xD;

VERSATION WITH MR. DUDLEY-IN THE CORNER WITH&#xD;
MISS PTON-.ANIMAL MAGNHTISDI-.-PETERSON'5 AP&#xD;
PROACH-ALICE AND 1.&#xD;
Proud in her pale beauty, dressed in a plain&#xD;
black velvet, with a japonica in her bosom, how&#xD;
like a queen, more, how like the beauty of 'Caro-&#xD;
lina,' Miss Singleton, my fair representative, stood&#xD;
amidst the crowd of wealthy, distinguished, am-&#xD;
bitious and fashionable people who thronged to her&#xD;
party, and did the honors of the occasion- That&#xD;
sweet smile, like moonlight upon marble, how it&#xD;
lived all over her bright face as she gave her wel-&#xD;
come to the very humblest of her guests! I thought&#xD;
I never saw her look so well, as with her dark hair&#xD;
parted plain and caught in a graceful twist, seem-&#xD;
ingly almost careless, with a silver comb, she stood&#xD;
by the fire-place not far from the mirror, which&#xD;
reflected back more dignity and womanly grace&#xD;
thaR ever before had crossed its surface. The&#xD;
word "loveable," I was about to say, applied to&#xD;
her more entirely than to any other woman I have&#xD;
ever known, (save one,) except perhaps that the&#xD;
desire to be near her and press her snowy hand&#xD;
was chastened by an awe, which I, not celebrated&#xD;
for such emotions where women are concernedcould&#xD;
not repress. I have seen it make other and even&#xD;
courtly men awkward. Her lips were tremulous&#xD;
with kindness and fascination as she spoke, and&#xD;
her nose, slightly aquiline, with her remarkably&#xD;
arched biows, formed, together with a figure which&#xD;
seemed modelled to show what dignified graceful-&#xD;
ness wasa combination of female attractions which,&#xD;
like the glorious picture of some old master, was a&#xD;
wonder and a despair to all other women and would&#xD;
have been a passion and a madness'to all men who&#xD;
beheld her, but for that undefiriable awe with&#xD;
which her presence impressed almost every man&#xD;
who approached her. I had often heard this re-&#xD;
marked by my acquaintances airoong the gentlemen.&#xD;
young and old; and, when in their cups, late at&#xD;
night, after such a scene, they discussed the ladies&#xD;
in a way in which gentlemen never should disCuss&#xD;
ladies, not even in their cups, I have often thought&#xD;
that I never heard one disrespectful word or one&#xD;
&#xD;
improper allusion or slighting remark made upon&#xD;
Miss Singleton.&#xD;
By the side of Miss Singleton, laughing and&#xD;
chatting with her, stood Miss Upton, whose gay&#xD;
and sparkling glance flashed round the room, and&#xD;
seemed to court the admiration which she was&#xD;
conscious of receiving from all. Her melting blue&#xD;
eye was radiant with the consciousness of health,&#xD;
position, wealth, power and beauty, and she only&#xD;
seemed to a careless observer, in her joyousness,&#xD;
anxious, perhaps too anxious, to please all; but a&#xD;
keener one could at once detect the purpose of one&#xD;
who had the desire to win without any idea of be.&#xD;
ing won. With facile and easy movement she re-&#xD;
minded one of an accomplished actress (she was&#xD;
an actress) who felt that she had trod the boards is&#xD;
triumph, and who, whenever her glance, or her&#xD;
tone, or her position made a "hit," expected the&#xD;
applause which was bound to follow. It must be&#xD;
confessed, also, that if that applause came not the&#xD;
lady was angry, and sometimes felt disposed to re-&#xD;
sent as art injury any stint or stay in the acknow-&#xD;
ledgment of attractions which she had been long&#xD;
taught to believe deserved and received universal&#xD;
homage. Something of a queenly feeling, like a&#xD;
real queen's thirst fin power, was this feeling for&#xD;
universal admiration in the heart of Miss Upton.&#xD;
Having made a conquest, she cared nothing for it&#xD;
except to display the trophies of her victory, and&#xD;
she turned to another to receive his attentions and&#xD;
his worship and to leave him where she round him,&#xD;
except for the wounds which his vanity and his&#xD;
heart were suffering. Miss Watson ("my own&#xD;
lonian Myrrah!" am I forgetting her?) was not a&#xD;
more consummate actress on the stage than was&#xD;
Miss Upton in society.&#xD;
have you ever, gentle reader, bid farewell to&#xD;
many dear friends who were all bound together in&#xD;
the same hark on some long and perilous voyage?&#xD;
And amidst those friends was there one whose im-&#xD;
age you cherished in your inmost heart with a&#xD;
holy and an abiding love? Then, after your many&#xD;
farewells with the c~hers, how to hint or to her you&#xD;
went last, but you had thought all the while of&#xD;
that last one, and how your soul travailed as with&#xD;
a death agony when that word that "must be and&#xD;
bath been" spoke only in that long, straining,&#xD;
absorbing embrace which would unite two souls,&#xD;
&#xD;
though their clayey tenements were doomed to of his ample neck-cloth which came down in front&#xD;
&#xD;
separation. So felt I' all the while towards Alice&#xD;
Glare-so thought I all the while-so my ardent&#xD;
eye (seemingly a careless glance) had seen her all&#xD;
the while; and there she stood, silent and apparent-&#xD;
ly absorbed, near Miss Singleton, also. What a&#xD;
trio!&#xD;
Attired in simple white, (1 think it was lace&#xD;
over satin, but my emotions would not let me scan&#xD;
her mere attire as I did her rival's) Alice looked&#xD;
rtore lovely than I had ever seen her. If in Miss&#xD;
Singleton you saw the dignified and winning wo-&#xD;
nan, and even to a man of the world, in Miss Up-&#xD;
ton the attractii.re one in spite of yourself, in Alice&#xD;
you saw (at least I did) the entirely loveable wo-&#xD;
nan, without the impression of that awe which 1&#xD;
aid modified the word "loveable" in applying- it&#xD;
to Miss Singleton. There, ripened into beautiful&#xD;
womanhood, was the being who had awakened my&#xD;
first ambition when .1 was an innocent boy, and&#xD;
those sweet lips which in girlhood had said "Willie&#xD;
Russell" with such endearing true-heartedness and&#xD;
lianor preference--there they wet-c, and the last&#xD;
words I heard them utter was the charge that&#xD;
had insulted her. And so I find, were I not the&#xD;
same Willie Russell-and so I would not, I would&#xD;
fain believe, even though I had acted as [did act,&#xD;
had she have known the actor.&#xD;
I have heard men say, who, have been in battle,&#xD;
in fact I know the impulse myself, that they felt&#xD;
in spite ofihemselves a certain misgiving of cow-&#xD;
ardace. if 'I may so express myself, on the first&#xD;
thought of the encounter before them. One pas-&#xD;
sion in its operations illustrates duother, and there-&#xD;
tore let me say that in spite of my manhood and&#xD;
ny pride in my address, that I fiolt a strange mis-&#xD;
giving as I looked at Alice. "Willie Russell,"&#xD;
i said to myself, be a luau; now, when you should&#xD;
sho~v no morbid beingg and no thing but address&#xD;
and ease, what has come over you.~~ There stood&#xD;
Peterson, not far front Alice; and, to (10 him no&#xD;
nore than justice, lie was the finest lookimt~ man&#xD;
a the room. Every care~ had been bestowed upon&#xD;
his toilette, and as thr as the simple adornments of&#xD;
our country allow he was attired magnificently.-&#xD;
Too much elaboration, I said to myself, as I scm-&#xD;
tenised his silk stockings curiously ribbed, and his&#xD;
~tent pimps, and Itis gay ~est, :ott(l the infoldin"&#xD;
&#xD;
like a waterfall, in which a large diamond breast-&#xD;
pin was stuck like a skewer. But another glance&#xD;
satisfied me that this description, which I ran over&#xD;
in my mind to myself was caricature-and the&#xD;
more so when I heard several parsons, and p~rtic-&#xD;
ularly the ladiesadmit'ing him. I thoughtof my&#xD;
own plain attire, and was provoked with myself&#xD;
that I had not bestowed more care upon it. At this&#xD;
moment Mr. Dudley, who was at my shoulder with-&#xD;
out my observing it, whispered me:&#xD;
"A fine person has Mr. Peterson, but he evinces&#xD;
the consciousness of it too much."&#xD;
I am almost ashamed to record that this remark&#xD;
gave me anything but displeasure. Mr. liudley&#xD;
continued:&#xD;
"The lady beside him is of herself the most&#xD;
beautiful person here; but there is a nameless some-&#xD;
thing about our fair hostess which has a gift of the&#xD;
spirit about it surpassing that of any other woman&#xD;
I have ever known." I bowed acquiescence and&#xD;
passed on to pay my respects to tlte lady.&#xD;
"You are late, Mr. Russell," she said, "consid-&#xD;
ering 'the pains I took to give you a bidding."&#xD;
"I was in the country," I replied; "when I re-&#xD;
ceived your invitation, and I hurried to town."&#xD;
"You look pale: have you not been well?"&#xD;
At this moment we stood alone, and I replied:&#xD;
"Yes, oh yes. But, Miss Singleton, since your&#xD;
flattering words to me, I acknowledge the truth of&#xD;
a new inipulse-of ambition-and I had just gone&#xD;
into die country to rusticate andreflect when your&#xD;
invitation reached me. I am here, may it please&#xD;
you, to do you Itontage."&#xD;
"Alt!" said she, giving me her hand with great~&#xD;
cordiality, '~l am so glad to hear it." She was&#xD;
about to add something, when the approach of Mr.&#xD;
l)ndley interrupted her, and she turned t~ him,&#xD;
though her Itand limigered a moment in mine, and&#xD;
1 saw the observant Englisltman noticed it.&#xD;
"Have you no bow for me, Mr. Russell?" ox-&#xD;
claimed Miss Uotoit, disengaging herself from the&#xD;
cooV.'d of gentlemen about her and giving me her&#xD;
hand. "I have something to tell you;" and so&#xD;
saying she put her arm itt mine, artd before I well&#xD;
knew what I was about, she led me to a corner of&#xD;
the reont. I glanced at Alice Glare amtd caught&#xD;
her eye, but it drol)ped the monoent she met my&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
THE AUTC(&#xD;
&#xD;
glance, and she blushed exceedingly and seeer&#xD;
much confused. I made an attempt to make&#xD;
bow to her, and as her eye fell I erected mys&#xD;
suddenly like a bent sapling, I said to myself as&#xD;
reflected upon it afterwards indignantly, that&#xD;
covers its erectness with a jerk.&#xD;
Arrived in the corner, and taking a seat as s&#xD;
motioned me to one, Miss Upton asked,&#xD;
Rave you heard the newsy"&#xD;
"Whatnews'?" I rejoined.&#xD;
"They say that Miss Glare is to marry Mr. F&#xD;
person."&#xD;
Now, it is a singular fact, that while the me&#xD;
meeting with Alice and Peterson threw me from ii&#xD;
self-possession, (there is certainly some reason wi&#xD;
it should have done so from my scene with Alice&#xD;
the carriage, and would have done so, perhaps, mo&#xD;
or less under any circumstances,) yet Miss Upton&#xD;
announcement of a report with regard to them, ti&#xD;
truth of which would have blasted my happiness&#xD;
fell on the ears of as self-possessed a man as an&#xD;
in the crowded rooms of Miss Singleton.&#xD;
Is there something in animal magnetism? Oi&#xD;
rather, as I believe it is said, animal magnetism&#xD;
makes one spirit charm another and bends it to ii&#xD;
will, did my nature take its hue from the sell&#xD;
command of Miss Upton as men gather coning&#xD;
from one another in battle'? I know not. It&#xD;
certain Miss Upton had no wish to inspire me-witi&#xD;
her spirit of self-command; and, after all, I may&#xD;
without remembering the fact now, myself hav4&#xD;
resolved as she led me to the corner, to betray rn&#xD;
emotion to her artful scrutiny, whatever it' migh:&#xD;
be. Be this as it may, I fancy that if a physician&#xD;
had felt my pulse he would hav~ found' it some&#xD;
pulsations less violent than the moment before.-&#xD;
This analysis of our emotions after all, like travel.&#xD;
ing in a circle, ends where it begins. Yet I ima-&#xD;
gine from the quick susceptibilities of my nature,&#xD;
which, as I think I have said before, had something&#xD;
womanly in them, it may be that my temperament is&#xD;
somewhat of the chamelion character, that is, takes&#xD;
its hue, from its association~ with others. This is&#xD;
more or less all men's natures, except those who&#xD;
are decided idiocyncracies; but it is certainly mine,&#xD;
and I suppose predominates in those natures thaL&#xD;
have a turn for poetry, and particularly for acting&#xD;
and oratory.&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
there stands Miss Glare, the fairest flower fron~j&#xD;
a city famous for its surpassing beauty." And ho~1&#xD;

a of the report of the marriage of Alice and Peterson&#xD;
elf evidently surprised her, but one of her determined&#xD;

"But can itbe true'?"&#xD;
"You know your sex better than 11 do," I repli-&#xD;

&#xD;
103&#xD;
&#xD;
my face flashed forth my admiration as I suited the&#xD;
action to the word, and felt myself gaze on Alice&#xD;
with a glance of admiration and tenderness which&#xD;
my best moods in Sardanapalus, even with my&#xD;
"own lonian Myrrha," and Byron's language to aid&#xD;
me, did not touch. (~7iMisstant Alice's eyes&#xD;
and mine met. Could there have been animal&#xD;
magnetism in mine? To me there was in her's;&#xD;
for our long and deep glances met each other and&#xD;
each seemed to look into the other's soul, yet was&#xD;
there no recognition in our manner save that.-&#xD;
Alice was the first to withdraw her glance, as she&#xD;
raised it quietly up to Peterson in answer to some&#xD;
remark that he was evidently making to her.&#xD;
Miss Upton's eye was full upon me as I turned&#xD;
to her, while she for a moment delicately with the&#xD;
tip of her fan touched her lip, and then suddenly&#xD;
resuming her gay and careless tone, she asked:&#xD;
"And Mr. Peterson? I have heard of him often&#xD;
before, but never met him until yesterday, when he&#xD;
called on me-he is certainly a very handsome&#xD;
man."&#xD;
"Very," I said, as a sudden thought struck me.&#xD;
"Yes, very. Certainly his devotion to Miss Glare&#xD;
merits a reward. lie's older than I am, but at a&#xD;
child's party years ago there was quite a rivalry&#xD;
between us for the smile of that same fair Miss&#xD;
Alice, theh an artless and beautiful little girl-&#xD;
saving your presence and Miss Singleton's-and&#xD;
much superior to her sex around her as she is to-&#xD;
night. I bel eve I rather was more in favor with&#xD;
her then than Peterson, but you see how it is now.&#xD;
She was my first love, and I believe she is Peter-&#xD;
son's first and last. I don'i~ believe it is in the&#xD;
power of any woman to get him away from her."&#xD;
"Don't you?" replied Miss Upton, hastily. The&#xD;
medicine is working, thought I.&#xD;
~ "I don't. Steady as the si~n's rising and as&#xD;
regular, has been his devotion to Alice, to Miss&#xD;
Glare."&#xD;
"You say Miss Glare now, do you'?"&#xD;
"Certainly-and Pet~rson is perhaps the wealth-&#xD;
iest young man in Baltimore."&#xD;
"Is he'? I never heard that."&#xD;
"Yes, the wealthiest-of one of the first fami~&#xD;
lies, as the Virginians say -without vices, that I&#xD;
have ever heard of, and with a personal beauty&#xD;
that draws admiration from every body."&#xD;

&#xD;
"There," thought ~ to myself, "I have done&#xD;
justice to my rival; but it was not for the sake of&#xD;
justice."&#xD;
"And you certainly think they will make a&#xD;
match'?" said Miss Upton, musingly.&#xD;
"Why, as the old ~vomen say, everything seems&#xD;
agreeable.~~&#xD;
"Tell me something about Mr. Peterson, now&#xD;
do-what kind of a person is he'?"&#xD;
"You see, Miss Upton."&#xD;
"Yes, yes, but let me know his character; you&#xD;
know," she said playfully, "you and I like to dis-&#xD;
sect character, when there is no scandal in it."&#xD;
"You see his character in his looks-he feels he&#xD;
is attractive to your sex. The artillery of many a&#xD;
glance has played on him without touching him-&#xD;
and he laughs at all women's power except Miss&#xD;
Clare's, and he feels that too deeply to say any-&#xD;
thing about it. I dare be sworn now, that he would&#xD;
give a look of wonder if any one were to tell him&#xD;
of the conquests you have made."&#xD;
"Upon my word then he is adamant to all but&#xD;
to one, and to her he is wax. Ah! Miss Glare and&#xD;
he are in close conversation Now she turns away&#xD;
from him to say something to Mr. Jumper-queer&#xD;
person that Mr. Jumper.~~&#xD;
"My particular friend," I said, "who has got&#xD;
me into more difficulties than any body else-it is&#xD;
a way particular friends have though. On my&#xD;
word, Mr. Peterson looks this way as if he were&#xD;
attracted. Well, if you can put a spell upon him&#xD;
it is what no other woman but Miss Glare has done,&#xD;
to my certain knowledge."&#xD;
"Let me say, Mr. Russell," replied Miss Upton,&#xD;
"that your knowledge can't be certain on that&#xD;
point. A man's wounded vanity scarcely ever&#xD;
tells of its aiflictioris-he oftener, like the Spartan&#xD;
boy when the fox was gnawing at his heart, hides&#xD;
the wound and denies the suffering. There isP no-&#xD;
thing in losing one's heart, but there is a great&#xD;
deal in having it found out-at least when we get&#xD;
ao other in return."&#xD;
Self-possessed as she was Miss Upton blushed&#xD;
under my searching glance, and passing quickly&#xD;
her delicate finger along the line of the hair on her&#xD;
forehead she observed:&#xD;
"You have a very impudent way of lowung at&#xD;

&#xD;
bad taste. We ought to be the greatest friends in dollars, and got it for him, to have been alone with&#xD;
the world-but be assured you are too young to Alice when she uttered these words. I felt I could&#xD;
read anything in me, less than anything, which ~ have held her closer to my heart than I did when&#xD;
did not mean to let you read." I caught her in her faIl, and for the instant I was&#xD;

"Both, if you please," replied Miss Upton, re- "I knew nothing else-I thought of nothing&#xD;

Peterson, who had left the side of Alice and was "I never for a moment dreamed it was you. I&#xD;
advancing towards us. On reaching us, Mr. Pe- had been here some days, and you had not paid&#xD;

with an ill grace, yet I could not have given any "Gall me Alice, Willie, Russell," she said,&#xD;

my aunt Betsey's endorsement for ten thousand been many-tells of battles lost and won,&#xD;
&#xD;
That party of Miss Singleton's lives upon my&#xD;
brain, some4mes like a rolling and fiery flame;&#xD;
then in a kind of quietness remembered aspirations of&#xD;
high and holy thoughts arise with it, and then lu-&#xD;
rid Ilashes, that seem to light but a darkness that&#xD;
threatened to be Egyptian, flickers over me, and&#xD;
the night of despair closes above me once more like&#xD;
engulphing waters. Then all is bright again.&#xD;
All my impetuous passions were concentrated&#xD;
into one absorbing one. I never shall forget how&#xD;
proudly and contentedly I seated myself in the vo-&#xD;
luptuous French chair by the side of Alice, and&#xD;
looked around me on the brilliant scene There&#xD;
was in it the deep enjoyment of the present, and&#xD;
the anticipation of victory in the future. "I re-&#xD;
mounted the river of my years," and I Pemembered&#xD;
that night at Alice Glare's party, and the "1 vow,&#xD;
Mr. Peterson, Willie Russell can beat you after all,"&#xD;
which was engraved on my heart at our child's&#xD;
party in characters of adamant, lived now in every&#xD;
pulse there in characters of flame.&#xD;
I leaned my elbow on the broad and cushioned&#xD;
'elbow of the chair beside me, and as I looked down&#xD;
at my plain boot I thought.I had as good a foot as&#xD;
Mr. Peterson, if he did wear a ribbed stocking on&#xD;
his. Now this thought of manhood no doubt was&#xD;
horn of the auld lang syne envy of Peterson's&#xD;
better toilette at Alice's party, and of my~many&#xD;
difficulties with Mrs. Clayton arising therefrom.&#xD;
And [looked at Peterson as he sat apparently ab-&#xD;
sorbed in coiversat:on with Miss Upton, and won-&#xD;
dered if it were possible that she could catch him.&#xD;
And then I said 'to myself "Why should I care? I&#xD;
only ask a fair field and no favor, with Alice." -&#xD;
How my airy castles mounted as Alice and I sat&#xD;
side by side, scarcely exchanging a word with each&#xD;
other-I believing that our full hearts were content&#xD;
with the silent welling of cur mutual passion.-&#xD;
Alice certainly was thinking of me in her silence~&#xD;
for I remember now how her person was inclined&#xD;
towards me, and experience has taught me that th&#xD;
unconscious inclination of a woman's person to&#xD;
wards him whom she thinks the most of in a corn&#xD;
pany, always betrays her to a scrutinizing eye.&#xD;
I never saw Alice look so well; and with&#xD;
trembling but earnest tone I told her so. Let&#xD;
also be confessed that I did my best (n9t forgetting&#xD;
to do it with tact) to display my opera cap in thi&#xD;
&#xD;
105&#xD;
&#xD;
eyes of Alice. I did so wish her to notice it, that&#xD;
I might expatiate upon the fascinations of Miss Sin-&#xD;
gleton-and be it further confessed that the deli-&#xD;
cate diamond ring which I wore on my little finger&#xD;
(the only finger I could get it on) was Miss Up-&#xD;
ton's. I glanced at Alice's hand-she had one&#xD;
suspicious-looking ring on her finger, only one.-&#xD;
and I could not but ask her where she got it.&#xD;
"I understand you, Mr. Willie Russell, you want&#xD;
me to ask you where your diamond sparkler came&#xD;
from, but I know-I can tell you, sir."&#xD;
"From whom, Alice'?"&#xD;
"From Miss Upton. I do not know how many&#xD;
gentlemen have worn it for a season."&#xD;
"Yes," I said, "and from appearances I should&#xD;
not be surprised if Mr. Peterson was the next to&#xD;
wear it for a season."&#xD;
"Well, let him. She is certainly very beauti-&#xD;
ful, and I suppose you will beartestimony that she&#xD;
is very captivating."&#xD;
"That's the universal testimony--&#xD;
"But what care I how kind she be,&#xD;
If she be not kind to me."&#xD;
"Oh! you are an affected person, Willie Russell,&#xD;
and I do believe that ~ ashington life will spoil&#xD;
you. You believe she has been as kind to you as&#xD;
to anybody-I know you do. Where did you get&#xD;
that beautiful opera cap?"&#xD;
"Saving your presence, the fairest woman that&#xD;
I know of wrought it for me with her own fair&#xD;
hand-one to whom, next to yourself, Alice, I owe&#xD;
more homage than to any other woman."&#xD;
"I do not know that you owe any homage to&#xD;
me," said Alice, blushing, but speaking seriously,&#xD;
"Who gave you the cap? the person that you play-&#xD;
ed Sardanapalus with?"&#xD;
"No, indeed! Miss Sallie Singleton, my fair&#xD;
representative."&#xD;
"You have many fair representatives."&#xD;
"Granted, but "&#xD;
"No compliments if you please; you always ut-&#xD;
- ter them as it you were on the stage and were re-&#xD;
plying to an actress. 1 think Miss Singleton has&#xD;
done you great honor. And now I understand why,&#xD;

"Alice, I am not indifferent to the fact that I&#xD;
have kind friends among your sex. And, Alice,&#xD;
you know ~&#xD;
"Don't speak so that every body can hear you,&#xD;
for gracious sake. The whole room is looking at&#xD;
us, and you remind me exactly of your manner&#xD;
when you were playing Sardanapalus with that&#xD;
actress. Don't you mean to ask me to dance?"&#xD;
"I do, if you prefer it to sitting here."&#xD;
"Certainly. The eyes of all the room are up-&#xD;
on us-and Miss tTptoa is looking at me like a&#xD;

I led her to the dance, where we could have&#xD;
very little conversation, and at its conclusion Mr.&#xD;
Dudley can~e up and engaged her for the next set.&#xD;
While we were grouped together, chatting, Mr&#xD;
Cotesworth, a member of Congress from South&#xD;

us; and, after making his bow to Alice, said:&#xD;
"Miss Glare, wherever the most beautiful wo-&#xD;
men are, there I find my friend Russell. When&#xD;
you are not h~re, I find him with Miss Singleton&#xD;
or Miss Uptor~, and when you are, it seems to me&#xD;
he is with all of you at once, as an Irishman would&#xD;
say. The other day, in New York, fascinated by&#xD;
the acting of the new star, Miss Watson, and&#xD;
charmed with what I had heard of her character,&#xD;
I sought an introduction to her, and the first ques-&#xD;
tion she asked me was of my friend herefor whom&#xD;
she professed the wildest kind of friendship. And&#xD;
to show you how much you attract even your own&#xD;
se~, she told me that she had marked you as the&#xD;
beauty of the monumental city, even in a crowded&#xD;
theatre."&#xD;
"You report, ~ exclaimed Alice, blushing&#xD;
and with some pique, "bold compliments in a bold&#xD;
way, Mr. ~&#xD;
"Truth is always bold," replied Mr. Cotes-&#xD;
worth.&#xD;
"And so are actresses, it appears, and the gen-&#xD;
tlemen who court their society."&#xD;
"You are sharp on me," exclaimed Mr. Cotes-&#xD;
worth, good-humoredly. "Well, I Iconfess to all&#xD;
the sin and shame of a profound admiration of Miss&#xD;
Watson. Russell, she had a crowd of admirers&#xD;
about her, and when I told her that I knew you&#xD;
well, and was to leave the xwxt morning early,&#xD;
she asked us to excuse her while she wrote a note&#xD;
&#xD;
to you, her best friend, as she called ~you; and she&#xD;
said to me 'you must tell him, Mr. Cotesworth,&#xD;
that, though I am always talking about him, he is&#xD;
even yet more in my heart than on my lips.' She&#xD;
assured me that you would make the best actor of&#xD;
the day. Ah, and I have your note. I inquired for&#xD;
you on my arrival, supposing that you would be&#xD;
most willing to receive Miss ~ missive;&#xD;
and hearing that you weze out of town, and know-&#xD;
ing that you would, of course, be here at Miss Sin-&#xD;
gleton's to-night, if you were within hailing dis~&#xD;
tance, I have brought it to you, and you owe me&#xD;
one."&#xD;
With a mixed feeling of gratification and annoy-&#xD;
ance, 1 received it as I remarked:&#xD;
"I trust Miss Watson is well~"&#xD;
"Very well-and looking most beautiful, and&#xD;
playing more beautifully than she looks, if that&#xD;
were possible,~~ replied Mr. Cotesworth. "She&#xD;
said she had received very flattering offers from&#xD;
the manager to play an engagement here, and that&#xD;
she had written to ask your advice upon accepting&#xD;
it-of course you will advise her to come, though&#xD;
she might not make as much as in New York-it&#xD;
is something to play here to the magnates of the&#xD;
land. MIss Clare, I pray you, whatever his judg-&#xD;
ment may urge him to do, that you put your com-&#xD;
mands upon him by all m~Nans to bring the lady&#xD;
here."&#xD;
"Mr. Russell, I fancy," exclaimed Alice in an&#xD;
excited, sarcastic tone,"needs no commands to that&#xD;
effect, and no commands to the contrary would in-&#xD;
duce him to give any other." Apd so saying, she&#xD;
took Mr. Dudley's arm and walked away.&#xD;
"Why, Russell," whispered Mr. Cotesworth,&#xD;
the l3altimore beauty was hard on me."&#xD;
I forced a laugh and said: "Miss Clare had to&#xD;
pretend a little anger to hide maybe the gratifica-&#xD;
tion your repetition of the compliment gave her."&#xD;
"No, that ain't it. It's bad policy to praise one&#xD;
woman to another. Better luck next time," he&#xD;
added as he lounged off to another part of the&#xD;
~oom.&#xD;
I withdrew to a corner, knowing that each and&#xD;
ill were so much occupied with themselves or&#xD;
heir partners as not to notice me, and read Miss&#xD;
~Vatson's letter. She complained with some se-&#xD;
rerity that I had not answered her last letter, and&#xD;
&#xD;
told me of the proffer of a lucrative engagement on&#xD;
the part of the manager for her to appear in Wash-&#xD;
ington, and she added that she meant to accept it if&#xD;
it was only that the poor "Greek Slave" might&#xD;
see once more her kingly Sardanapalus.&#xD;
I felt my face brighten-my heart burned wildly&#xD;
toward my "own lonian Myrrha," and I forgot my&#xD;
locality and read over arid over again her interes-&#xD;
ting letter, which was so, exquisitely expressed,&#xD;
though written amidst the crowd of admirers and&#xD;
flatterers around her. As I gazed at her signature,&#xD;
and threw my delighted glance across the room~ in&#xD;
the effort of memory to place most vividly before&#xD;
me her glorious personation of the loving Jonian,&#xD;
I caught the eye of Alice full upon me, with a&#xD;
pained and searching expression, which caused me&#xD;
to dangle in seeming carelessness the letter in my&#xD;
hand as I walked away.&#xD;
in I felt a kind of gratification I must confess, yet&#xD;
spite of myself I was growing dull, and but for&#xD;
my fixed resolution to abstain frogi wine, I should&#xD;
willingly have joined Sangston, who at that mo-&#xD;
ment came up and said: "Russell, ain't you going&#xD;
to drink the health of your fair representative in&#xD;
some of her own wine. She sent all the way to&#xD;
Charleston for it; and, like herself, it intoxicates&#xD;
without "&#xD;
"Any head nolan?" I asked.&#xD;
"Yes,'yes, but there's the heart ache afterwards,&#xD;
Russell."&#xD;
I saw in a moment 'that Sangston had drank too&#xD;
much-and just as I vas about to propose it he&#xD;
took my arm and we stepped into another room,&#xD;
less heated, and which was nearly deserted in con-&#xD;
sequence of many having gone to the other party,&#xD;
and the dance commanding the attention of the&#xD;
rest.&#xD;
"Russell," he said, h a gloomy tone, "I shall&#xD;
not be restored to my place. Time Secr~ tary abso-&#xD;
lately refuses it, and says it is on account of rmiy&#xD;
habits. Cotesworth, who you know is a great&#xD;
friend of mine-and you know what a blunt, open&#xD;
fellow he is-has just returned. Well, he saw the&#xD;
Secaet~ry to-day, and he 1)ositively refused to re-&#xD;
instate me. I have lived upon the hope."&#xD;
"Don't give up yet. He is in for it, I suspect,&#xD;
with Miss Singleton, the Secretary is, I think-&#xD;
and I certainly think there can be no impropriety&#xD;
- in asking her to use her influence with him."&#xD;
&#xD;
107&#xD;
&#xD;
"Not for the world, Russell. I'll tell you&#xD;
something-I got it all from Cotesworth-the Sec-&#xD;
retary has courted her again and again-he thinks&#xD;
I am in his way: if 1 were I should not want office&#xD;
long. He says he can give me an office in the&#xD;
New Orleans Custom House, but not here. He&#xD;
wants to kill me off with fever. His insincerity is&#xD;
apparent-for if my habits keep me out of office&#xD;
here they ought to keep me out of office there.&#xD;
"But why not go there'?"&#xD;
"Go thexe!" he said almost wildly.&#xD;
"San gston, pardon me-but you love Miss Sin-&#xD;
gleton'?"&#xD;
"Love her!" he half whispered as he grasped&#xD;
my baud wildly: "that's no word for it I adore&#xD;
her-but its no use; I'm a wreck amidst the&#xD;
breakers. Sometimes when I look at her and think&#xD;
that I shall never possess her, and that another&#xD;
may, I cannot tell you what fierce, stern, diabolical&#xD;
thoughts arise in my heart. But she flung the&#xD;
honorable secretaryy sky high."&#xD;
"1-low old is G.-, the secretary'?~~&#xD;
"I don't know-torty-five or fifty, I suppose.&#xD;
He has address, position, every thing; and he does&#xD;
not lool~ as old as he is. But she flung him; and&#xD;
he thinks I am the cause of it. I would rather be&#xD;
the cause of it than he a king."&#xD;
"That is, you wouhi rather possess Mi~s Single-&#xD;
ton."&#xD;
"Faint heart never won fair lady,~~ I remarked.&#xD;
"Yes, but such a fair lady, Russell. Her fath-&#xD;
er was intemperate. Not ten minutes ago I heard&#xD;
her say that her greatest objection to giving a par-&#xD;
ty was the idea ofl so many persons exciting them-&#xD;
selves~by wine. She is a monomaniac on the sub-&#xD;
ject in consequence ot her father's habits; and she&#xD;
said she was determined at least that her guests&#xD;
should not be poisoned with bad xvine, so she had&#xD;
her wines from Charleston-they were her 1~ther's.&#xD;
Cotesworth, who loves his glass dearly; told her&#xD;
she was too rigid; and she replied, with that&#xD;
awing dignity of her's which awed even him, 'No,&#xD;
sir.' Lie said, 'SuPPOSe your lover was fond of his&#xD;
glass and sometimes took tuo much, what then,&#xD;
Miss Singleton?' "Lover, sir! Mr. Cotesworth,&#xD;
1 pledge you my word that no man whom I had&#xD;
seen intoxicated would I suffer to address me. ~&#xD;

would not suffer myself to think of him;' and&#xD;
somehow I thought she glanced at me."&#xD;
"A guilty conscience, Sangston," I said.&#xD;
"Do I seem to have been drinking? Well, well.&#xD;
Coteewortli remarked: 'I fear, Miss Singleton, you&#xD;
will die a maidor marry a fanatic.' 'I may do&#xD;
neither,' she replied, 'though I think the first fate&#xD;
is the likeliest.' My mother, I suppose, has beert&#xD;
making Miss Singleton her confidant. You don't&#xD;
know what these mothers are who love you over&#xD;
much, and make peopl&amp;amp;their confidant about you.&#xD;
And then to make Miss Singleton her confidant&#xD;
about me. I suppose she has told her of all my&#xD;
scrapes-women and all."&#xD;
There was a pause in the conversation. Sang-&#xD;
ston resumed:&#xD;
"Yes, Ru~seVl, I will tell you-she said you&#xD;
were not a fanatic, and that you drank no wine;&#xD;
and Cotesworth swjue that you deserved no credit&#xD;
for it; that you could not drink. 'Not without be-&#xD;
coming, like other gentlemen, excited from drink-&#xD;
ing!' ~aid Miss Singleton, in her keen way. lie&#xD;
colored, and said he would make you drink before&#xD;
the evening was over."&#xD;
"Well, I don't deserve any credit for it, for I&#xD;
cannot drink without becoming very much excited.&#xD;
Sangeton, you must not get on a frolic now, my&#xD;
good fellow. Reform it altogether1 and tell Miss&#xD;
Singleton it is for her sake that you have done it."&#xD;
"Oh! God! for the will, Russell.- the purpose.&#xD;
But what would Miss Singleton do for my sake."&#xD;
"You do not know what she might do, indeed&#xD;
you do not. 1 know Miss Singleton has a deep&#xD;
interest in you.~~&#xD;
"Yes, my mother must tell her every thie:g&#xD;
about me-I know she did. That's the interest-&#xD;
the interest which a proud, rich, patrician woman&#xD;
takes in a petty ex-official like me-a beggar. But&#xD;
there's one thing certain, and ~ have been brooding&#xD;
over it for days."&#xD;
"What's that?"&#xD;
"Why, I can give Mr. Secretary almost as high&#xD;
a toss as he gave me. I think I can, if reports be&#xD;
true I can."&#xD;
"How?" I asked, with much interest.&#xD;
This seemed to recall Sangstora to himself; and,&#xD;
after a pause, he said;&#xD;
&#xD;
WILLIAM RUSSELL.&#xD;

&#xD;
stay all night with me-I shall feel lonely after "You two have tortured each otherlongenough,"&#xD;
the excitement, and we'll have such a talk." I'e-f and without uttering another word she entered her&#xD;
&#xD;
"Russell, if I tell you something, you will nos&#xD;
say a word.&#xD;
"Not a word," I said.&#xD;
Here Miss Singleton entered the room, and&#xD;
coming up to us, said,&#xD;
"Is this the way, gentlemen, you make your.&#xD;
selves agreeable~.certainly ~o each other you are&#xD;
very agreeable; but I want you to be agreeable to&#xD;
my company."&#xD;
Sangston and I both rose, and he turned aside&#xD;
when Miss Singleton took my arm, and we prom.&#xD;
ended for a few moments up and down the room,&#xD;
while Sangston silently withdrew, and Ijudged&#xD;
from the direction which he took as he passed out&#xD;
of the door that he was going to the supper room.&#xD;
More wine, I feared.&#xD;
Miss Singleton looked after Sangston and un.&#xD;
consciously heaved a sigh; and after two or three&#xD;
steps she asked:&#xD;
"Has Mr. Coeesworth grown eloquent to you&#xD;
yet over my wine."&#xD;
"No, he has not."&#xD;
"He threatened to do so don't let him be your&#xD;
Comus."&#xD;
"No, he shall not. You, Miss Singleton, might&#xD;
tempt me with the Circean cup-th~i honorable&#xD;
member from South Carolina certainly cannot-..-&#xD;
none but you.~~&#xD;
"Ah! am I the only one? Miss Upton, more,&#xD;
Miss Clare, sir, is here."&#xD;
"StillAnone but you. You have the power, ~Miss&#xD;
~'"ngleton, to make men obey you as well as love&#xD;
you.~~&#xD;
"Oh! you traitor to true love! Dare you tell&#xD;
Alice Clare that?"&#xD;
"'What man dare, I dare,' though my gallantry&#xD;
would not let me say that of one lady to another-.-&#xD;
it would be in bad taste, would it nut'? And yet&#xD;
I think I might say it of you, and have all acknow-&#xD;
ledge its truthfulness as well as appropriateness."&#xD;
It wan now long after midnight. l steod by Miss&#xD;
Singleton's side as her guests were making their&#xD;
good-night bows to her. Miss Upton joined us&#xD;
when Alice came up oa Mr. Peterson's arm to say&#xD;
good-night. She but glanced at me with a cold&#xD;
bow as she gave her hand to Miss Singleton. I&#xD;
returned it profoundly on my part.&#xD;
"No, Alice," said Miss Singleton, "you must&#xD;
&#xD;
terson said n~ver a word, bur stood as if obedient&#xD;
to Miss Singleton's behest. She continued: "Mr.&#xD;
Peterson, as Miss Upton cannot go home with all&#xD;
those gentlemen she has made my company so gay&#xD;
with to-night, and for which I owe her so much,&#xD;
you, I know, will see that she gets home safely."&#xD;
"Ah!" said Miss Upton, quickly, and with more&#xD;
earnestness than she would willingly have betray-&#xD;
ed, as I thought: "Then, sir, that you may not&#xD;
prove recreant, I'll go at once-secure you while&#xD;
the command of Miss Singleton is upon you." And&#xD;
gaily taking Mr. Peterson's arm, which Alice had&#xD;
resigned upon the invitation of Miss Singleton to&#xD;
spend the night with her, Miss Upton dropped her&#xD;
prettiest curtsey, Mr. Peterson made his best bow,&#xD;
and they withdrew.&#xD;
"Alice, you have lost your beau," said Miss&#xD;
Singleton to her as she placed herself at her side.&#xD;
"She is welcome," said Alice.&#xD;
"Just like our sex," said Miss Singleton; "they&#xD;
never value true devotion; they are always follow-&#xD;
ing the ignis fatuns somewhere."&#xD;
Alice said she liked Mr. Petorson well enough;&#xD;
and there was a silence. Soon all the company&#xD;
withdrew, and Miss Singleton, Alice and myself&#xD;
were left alone. "I must bid you good night, Miss&#xD;
Singleton," I said.&#xD;
"Not yet," said she. "Come with us into my&#xD;
private parlor-it is nex to my chamber-and&#xD;
when we ladies get tired of you we will give yoa&#xD;
the hint, and be in the land of dreams very soon&#xD;
~ So saying, she took my arm-I of-&#xD;
fered Alice the other and we repaired thither.-&#xD;
When we entered we found- no person there but&#xD;
Janet, a bright-eyed quadroon, who was the wait-&#xD;
ing maid of Miss Singleton. "I shall not want&#xD;
you, .Janet; you may go to bed; shut the door after&#xD;
you." Janet courtsied, asked her mistress if she&#xD;
night send some cake to Miss Upton's Mary, and&#xD;
receiving a ~certainlyI~ for answer, withdrew.&#xD;
I don't know why, but I felt awkward; so evi-&#xD;
dently did Alice. Miss Singleton looked at us&#xD;
both with deep interest as we three stood together&#xD;
by the fire place. There was the silence of a min-&#xD;
ute, when, taking Alice's hand, she placed it in&#xD;
mine and said:&#xD;
&#xD;
* chamber and closed the door after her. I looked at&#xD;
Alice for a moment-she held down her head and&#xD;
said not a word. In a instant more I clasped in&#xD;
my arms the , the yielding Alice Clare&#xD;
....and, in words that came from my very soul, I&#xD;
told her how long and how earnestly I had loved&#xD;
her. All at once she burst into tearsand exclaimed'&#xD;
"If you love me so much., if you have loved me&#xD;
so long, explain to me-yes, I will ask it-explain&#xD;
to me what is there between you and Miss Wat~&#xD;
son'?"&#xD;
Ah! but I felt that I loved Alice the dearer for&#xD;
this question-for I thought I felt how dearly she&#xD;
loved me. I was a long time in the explanation,&#xD;
for I told Alice everything-tiny frolic, Miss Wat-&#xD;
son's care of me and all; and as I saw it heightened&#xD;
her interest in me, I did not coldly expatiate upon&#xD;
Miss Watson's noble character; but I did full jus-&#xD;
tice to her attractions, and frankly told Alice&#xD;
that but for my love for her, I certainly should have&#xD;
flung caste and family considerations tQ the winds&#xD;
and have made love to Miss Watson-if, I contin-&#xD;
ued, I had not met with Miss Singleton in the&#xD;
meantime. I then retaliated by asking her about&#xD;
Peterson, but I soon found that she had never par-&#xD;
ticularly cared for him. Oh! long remembered&#xD;
night!&#xD;

NESSES OUR MEETING-THE CONSEQUENCE-&#xD;
CONVERSATION WITH MISS WATSON-SHE PRO-&#xD;
POSES THAT I SHOULD PLAY SARDANAPALUS&#xD;
WITH HER-MnSs UPTON-THE MANAGER.&#xD;
Among my acquaintances was a member from&#xD;
Connecticut; one of the quaintest arid most unique&#xD;
persons I have ever known. His name was Job&#xD;
Darlington-or, to give him his full title in the&#xD;
premises, in which he seemed to rejoice very much,&#xD;
the Honorable Job Darlington. Keenness and&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC8021-00000055"/>&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
110&#xD;
&#xD;
quaintness stuck out all over him, and you won]&#xD;
think, to look at him, that such a quality as cou&#xD;
age, if he ever had it, had, to use a Westex&#xD;
ii!&#xD;
phrase, "caved in with him long ago.~~ He was ii&#xD;
offensive and kind, and so shrewd withal, that&#xD;
~j I&#xD;
delighte~l to chat with him; and though ther&#xD;
seemed to be no points of afiioity between us w&#xD;
agreed t~mazingly-par4cularly upon the subject&#xD;
the Union and political abolitionism.&#xD;
In debate. one of the Southern members-pre&#xD;
suing, I shrewdly suspect, upon the forhearanc&#xD;
and peace-loving qualities of the gentleman fron&#xD;
the Puritan State-gro~sIy insulted him by mon&#xD;
than insinuating that he was a trickster and&#xD;
coward, and one of the manufacturers of wooden&#xD;
nutmegs with which they had sprinkled the brands&#xD;
tijddies of the South, much to the injury of South&#xD;
em digestive organs.&#xD;
The Yankee replied that bran bread was much&#xD;
better than brandy toddies for weak stomachs and&#xD;
weak brains, and that the wooden nutmeg had the&#xD;
effect of bran bread, and he therefore recommended&#xD;
the continued use of them to his opponent, partic-&#xD;
ularly if he continued his toddies, and his digestion&#xD;
continued impaired; (a hard hit, for the gentleman&#xD;
*        was in both categories, that is, weak in digestion&#xD;
and given to toddies;) and he of Connecticut more-&#xD;
over proceeded to say that if they did manufacture&#xD;
wooden nutmeg in his State, there were no such&#xD;
fools as to buy them in it, and they therefore had&#xD;
to resort to the constituents of the gentleman, and&#xD;
the gentleman himself, for purchasers.&#xD;
My friend Job's decidedly funny manner con-&#xD;
vulsed the House with laughter; but none of the&#xD;
patience of his namesake pertained to the member&#xD;
from the South, who applied' as many ill-names to&#xD;
the gentleman from Connecticut, and as volubly,&#xD;
as could any fish-woman in any fish-market of the&#xD;
world. Job laid back and laughed heartily at his&#xD;
opponent-one of those honest and true laughs&#xD;
which are contagious, and the whole house caught&#xD;
it, and laughed again, until the member's tones of&#xD;
rage were drowned in the echoes of the laughter at&#xD;
him. After repeati'd calls to t)rder it was at last&#xD;
obtained-the member of' the South frowning fierce&#xD;
defiance, with war on his very brows,-and the&#xD;
member from Connecticut looking meek as Moses&#xD;
and as pleasant as a ripple in the sunshine. I saw&#xD;
&#xD;
111&#xD;
&#xD;
d it all, and I must say that the bearing of "Connecti-&#xD;
r- cut" pleased me very much, for I saw character and&#xD;
n courage sticking out all over him; besides, I had a&#xD;
t- grudge against the Southern man for something ho&#xD;
i had said about myself and Miss Watson, and I&#xD;
e rejoiced in his discomfiture.&#xD;
e As the Honorable Job came laughing out of the&#xD;
jf Hall of the House I met him and congratulated&#xD;
him on his success in flooring the Hon. Mr. Fris&#xD;
bie. "But, my dear 5ir," said I, "he is a perfect&#xD;
e fire-eater."&#xD;
~   "I've heard ~   exclaimed the meek-looking Job,&#xD;
~ while a 9ast of serious thought dispelled the smile&#xD;
whnch played upon his features as he met me.-&#xD;
"I've heard so; but there's one thing certain, he&#xD;
may eat fire, and he's got to eat his words, tu6,&#xD;
- before I'll eat mine. How shall 1 proceed? Tin&#xD;
fact is that if he challenges me in my own name I&#xD;
can't accept it. It ~vill kill tue with my constitu-&#xD;
ents stone dead-I shall be honorable no longer,&#xD;
whether I fight or not. You know if I challenge&#xD;
him I'll have to sign my name to it-that won't&#xD;
do with my constituents-they are almost all&#xD;
church members. If he challenges me I have the&#xD;
choice of weapons-that's one advantage- and yet&#xD;
I wish I could have an alias like other folks, (not&#xD;
very honorable, by the bye, but law-breakers, nev-&#xD;
ertheless,) then I could satisfy the fire-eater, and&#xD;
my constituents wouldn't know anything about it,&#xD;
unless I am shot, and then there'll be an end of the&#xD;
matter-but I have a craving desire to gratify the&#xD;
gentleman. I have written him a note to that ef&#xD;
feet, but I have begged that he would challenge&#xD;
me under an alias, here's the note-you are my&#xD;
very man; I know you understand these things,&#xD;
and you'll suit me to a 'I'."&#xD;
I could not but laugh heartily, but my friend&#xD;
Darlington assured me that it was no joking mat-1&#xD;
ter with him, for it would lose him his re-election&#xD;
to a certainty if he fought, and that he could not&#xD;
afford to do. as the per diem was ~vorth more than&#xD;
his practice, to say nothing of the honor.&#xD;
Now Frisbie was a starch, precise individual,&#xD;
and I had reason to believe, notwithstanding the&#xD;
airs he gave himself, that be was not the bravest&#xD;
man in the world after all.&#xD;
"Give me the note," said I, "I'll hand it to him&#xD;
and make the explanation,~~&#xD;
&#xD;
THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF&#xD;
&#xD;
WILLIAM RUSSELL.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Do," replied Darlington, "and Russell, yot&#xD;
must see me through."&#xD;
[left him, and immediately sent my card int'~&#xD;
the ball by one of the pages~ with the request t&#xD;
see the Honorable Win. Frisbie as soon as conve-&#xD;
nient, as I was in waiting. He made his appear-&#xD;
ance, and I presented him the note, saying it wa~&#xD;
from Mr. Darlington.&#xD;
"I have challenged him myself, sir, I have the&#xD;
right of challenge," he remarked, with some sur-&#xD;
prise as he took the note and proceeded to read it.&#xD;
"This is trifling, sir," he exclaimed, as he tore&#xD;
the note to tatters~ "trifling sir! I don't allow&#xD;
any dodge like this-can't be re-elected if his con-&#xD;
stituents know he fights-wants me to challenge&#xD;
him under an alias-he had better get me to fight&#xD;
him by an alias too, by another-its no go sir, he&#xD;
mL~st take the responsibility."&#xD;
"Certainly he must, or I must for him, Mr.&#xD;
Frisbie, as I am acting as his friend."&#xD;
Mr. Frisbie looked perplexed and amazed. I&#xD;
remarked that there was no doubt, truth in what&#xD;
Mr. Darlington said-that they could easily meet&#xD;
without any formal challenge in the matter.-&#xD;
"You had better send your friend to me, Mr.&#xD;
~ I said, "and we can arrange matters&#xD;
without any formality of this kind."&#xD;
"Sir, the laws of honor are laws of etiqnette,~~re~&#xD;
joined Mr. Frisbie, "and this is a perplexing posi-&#xD;
tion-in fact sir, Mr. Darlington will find it's no&#xD;
jesting."&#xD;
"He is an eccentric person I know Mr. Fris-&#xD;
bie, but [asmre you that he is entirely in earnest."&#xD;
"Well, sir, I must consult a friend upon this&#xD;
~most preposterous ~)roposition.~~&#xD;
"If you plcase,~~ I said, as I made him my&#xD;
obeisance and withdrew, "1 shall remain at my&#xD;
lodgings to-day, expecting some friend's call."&#xD;
As I entered the rotunda of the Capitol J found&#xD;
Darlington quietly talking and laughing with some&#xD;
of his acquaintances, and telling him what had&#xD;
passed, I withdrew.&#xD;
Within an hour 14'risbie's friend, Dr. Merrill,&#xD;
called on me, and we made the arrange nent that&#xD;
without any formal challenge the parties should&#xD;
meet near Bladensburg at a certain place indicated&#xD;
that afternoon, at five o'clock-quick work.&#xD;
That day Darlington dined with me. Like&#xD;
15&#xD;
&#xD;
myself he drank no wine, and his tall, awkward&#xD;
form and awkward manner, with his quiet, dry hu-&#xD;
mor, and yet apparent nervous sensitiveness,&#xD;
amused me very much. I made some allusion to&#xD;
* the meeting.&#xD;
*   "We won't talk about that," said he, "'suffi-&#xD;
cient to the day is the evil thereof.' ~' I can't stand&#xD;
being called a coward you know; for though we&#xD;
are right straight-in a direct line I mean-from&#xD;
the Puritans, yet, believe me, 1 have not the mor-&#xD;
al courage necessary to resist meeting Frisbie.&#xD;
That which he calls courage, is not confined exclu-&#xD;
sively to the South. To tell you the truth, I mean&#xD;
to receive his first fire, and fire in the air. It&#xD;
would be firing in the air any how, should I shoot&#xD;
at him, for 1 have no practice with the pistol or&#xD;
any other carnal weapon that flesh is heir to ex-&#xD;
cept a knife and fork."&#xD;
1 remonstrated with him earnestly, but it was&#xD;
of no use. He laughed heartily. "He wont hit&#xD;
me I tell you,~~ he remarked. "At least there are&#xD;
many chances in my favor. Don't you kn iW it'?&#xD;
Did you never hear the story of the old Chief&#xD;
(General Jackson he meant) and Grundy'?"&#xD;
"Never," I replied.&#xD;
"Well, as I have heard it, somebody challenged&#xD;
Grundy, who being a member of the church, and&#xD;
not very valorous, as the old Chief knew, went&#xD;
to him to consult him as to his acceptance of it.&#xD;
The old Chief heard him patiently. 'Mr. Grun-&#xD;
dy,' he rejoined, 'you must accept. Quit the&#xD;
church for the occasion, like the Quaker throw by&#xD;
your coat. If you accept, sir, there are ten chan-.&#xD;
ces to one that you (loU't meet; if you do meet there&#xD;
are ten chances to one that you don't fight. If you&#xD;
do fight, there are ten chances to one that he don't&#xD;
hit you. If hedoes hit you, there are ten chances&#xD;
to one that it aint mortal, and if it is mortal, Mr.&#xD;
Grundy, by the Eternal, sir, we must all die.'"&#xD;
That afternoon found us on the ground. Pistols&#xD;
and ten paces was the arrangement. Patiently as&#xD;
his namesake, and as coolly as the old Chieftain&#xD;
possibly could have acted i~ the matter, Darling~&#xD;
ton received the fire of Fri;bie and fired in the air.&#xD;
Frisbie demanded another shot, hut I Peremptorily&#xD;
interfered, and Dr. Merrill, who was disposed to&#xD;
adjust matters, said that his principal ought to be&#xD;
satisfied, and so the parties shook hands; Darling-&#xD;

all rode into thecity and supped together. This wa&#xD;
the beginning of a fast friendship between 'Connec&#xD;
ticut~ and myself, as ~e used to call Darlington&#xD;
and I record the incident to show that we should no&#xD;
always judge from appearances; for if a cowan&#xD;
had been sent into a crowd to insult some one, h&#xD;
certainly, if Darlington had been there, would hay&#xD;
selected him as the one who would have suffenem&#xD;
him to escape with impunity.&#xD;
A few days after this, my friend Job entered m~&#xD;
room to say that Cotesworth was sick after an over&#xD;
indulgence, and had sent him to me with a letter.&#xD;
"Which," said Job, laughing as he handed it t&#xD;
me, "came directed to Coresworth. He says it h&#xD;
from a magnificent creature-the actress-the Mist&#xD;
Watson who is making such a talk, and whc&#xD;
Cotesworth is talking about all the time. He callt&#xD;
me Connecticut and I call him South Carolina, and&#xD;
I think South Carolina has as many notions at&#xD;
Connecticut, only after a different fashion."&#xD;
~ ~ said I, laughing, "are&#xD;
women and wine. What are Connecticut's?"&#xD;
The Honorable Job laughed his peculiarly ho.&#xD;
amorous laugh, atid replied-&#xD;
"The language of Cowper, with the exception of&#xD;
one word, 'just expresses it-I mean the character.&#xD;
istics of my folks-&#xD;
"Various.&#xD;
That the mind of Southern men,&#xD;
Studious of change and pleased with novelty.&#xD;
May be indulged."&#xD;
"Duped you mean," said I, joking him.&#xD;
"Well, duped if you please," he exclaimed, "in&#xD;
any way you choose, caveat emptoF. Let the&#xD;
buyer look out to translate it into the vernacular.&#xD;
Who in the deuce is this 'glorious woman' that&#xD;
'South Carolina' is always talking about?"&#xD;
"You must excuse me my friend," I said, "this&#xD;
short note is from that 'glorious creature,' and I&#xD;
must hasten to meet her on h~r arrival. Excuse&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"Certainly, but look here, don't you get enamor-&#xD;
ed too," called out Connecticut after me. "If you&#xD;
do, I shall have to stand by you as you stood by&#xD;
me in the Frisbie affair." As I hastened down to&#xD;
the stage office (shall I confess it) I folt annoyed&#xD;
that Miss Watson should write~to me, under cover&#xD;
&#xD;
e to Cotesworth, and I puzzled myself much over the&#xD;
s inquiry whether there was anything peculiar in his&#xD;
manner when he handed me Miss Watson's letter&#xD;
~ at Miss Singleton's party.&#xD;
t As I thus hurried down the avenue and cogitated,&#xD;
LI I heard a violent rap at the window of the fashion.&#xD;
e able boarding house of Mrs. Sands, and looking up&#xD;
a I beheld Miss Watson trying to raise the window&#xD;
I dnd call to me.&#xD;
Quick as thought I darted up the broad stair.&#xD;
way into the front room, and before I thought any.&#xD;
thing of my whereabouts-except that I had met&#xD;
Miss Watson-or who might be looking~ on, I&#xD;
caught her in an eager embrace as she exclaimed&#xD;
"my kingly Sardanapalus,~~ and I rejoined "my&#xD;
own lonian Myrrha," and our lips met ~shall' 1&#xD;
say as warmly) as ev~r the kings aforesaid met the&#xD;
lips of his devoted lonian.&#xD;
Steps in the next room-for the folding doors&#xD;
were open-I had not thought there was a aexi&#xD;
room until that moment-arrested my 'attention,&#xD;
and who should I see leaving it with a tread of the&#xD;
haughtiest scorn and dignity hot Alice Clare.&#xD;
"Pardon me one moment," I said, as I handed&#xD;
Miss Watson to the sofa and sprang after Alice,&#xD;
whom I did not overtake until she had gotten to&#xD;
the front door. "Good morning, Alice," 1 said.-&#xD;
She turned on me, and her brow wore an offended&#xD;
dignity that was regal. Miss Watson could not&#xD;
have personated it as well, nor Miss Singleton&#xD;
have looked it better. "Leave me," she exclaim-&#xD;
ed, and she stamped sternly with her foot, and&#xD;
beckoning to the footman of Miss Singleton, whose&#xD;
carriage I had not noticed when I entered the&#xD;
house, she plhccd herself within it and ordered the&#xD;
coachman to drive on, before I could say a word. I&#xD;
looked after her a moment, and scarcely knowing&#xD;
what I did re-entered the house. On the steps 1&#xD;
met Miss Upton, who pettishly inquired: "have&#xD;
you seen Alice Clare? What in the world has&#xD;
become of her? Shine started out early to do some&#xD;
shopping. She would get out of the carriage to&#xD;
wait in the' parlor for me, and now she has gone&#xD;
off in a pet-.~astouishing."&#xD;
As I did not choose to make any explanation to&#xD;
Miss Upton, and merely made the remarim "I don't&#xD;
know," she hastened out ma l)et too, and I return-&#xD;
ed to the side of Miss Watson.&#xD;
&#xD;
WILLIAM&#xD;
&#xD;
The lovely actress had greatly improved since I n&#xD;
last saw her. What an air success gives one, gen- t]&#xD;
tie reader. I remember some one says that the first t&#xD;
time he saw Cromwell was before that personage (&#xD;
had arisen to power, and when he was only a&#xD;
member of parliament, and theta the observer was&#xD;
only struck with his slovenly appearance, his ple-&#xD;
beian look and his red nose, but he goes on to say&#xD;
that he lived to see him protector of England, and&#xD;
to consider him a person of distinguished bearing&#xD;
and presence. Always Miss Watson was at-&#xD;
tractive in my eyes, from my first interview with&#xD;
(&#xD;
her, when I was accompanied by Horsley, to the&#xD;
present moment, but there was an air of hilarity I&#xD;
and happiness about her now, which gave fell de-&#xD;
velopment to her cheerful and self-sustained na-&#xD;
ture. She took my hand as I returned to her side&#xD;
and said so brightly and with such a joyous tone&#xD;
"You look well-I have heard such bright ac-&#xD;
counts of you-but why are you not' a controlling&#xD;
spirit among those higher spirits, as well as among&#xD;
the merely fashionable."&#xD;
"Like Miss Singleton," I thought to myselfand&#xD;
was about to reply when she asked-&#xD;
"And how is your lady love?-you scarcely&#xD;
mentioned her in your letter, except that she&#xD;
was here. Did you want me to come-say, now&#xD;
tell the truth, did you riot think that she would get&#xD;
jealous of me?"&#xD;
Pleased and perplexed, yet struck with a kind&#xD;
of histrionic impression of the scene between Alice&#xD;
and myself, I told Miss Wa son what had jast oc-&#xD;
curr~d.&#xD;
She looked serious.&#xD;
"Indeed, I am sorry," she said. "There seems&#xD;
to be some fatality that thrusts me between the&#xD;
fair Baltimorean and yourself. Go after her and&#xD;
make the explanation. I don't wonder that she&#xD;
dismissed you with so much dignity. Our greet-&#xD;
ing, you must remember, was not a mere rehearsal&#xD;
-it was a reality. Long ago, Miss Clare, as I&#xD;
told you at the time, liked not our mere stage play&#xD;
embracing. This tenderness in our private theat-&#xD;
ricals must, of course, touch her."&#xD;
"Private theatricals," exclaimed I, piqued. "I&#xD;
assure you, Miss Watson, I was not acming.~~&#xD;
"Acting!" she said seriously. "No, toy dear&#xD;
Russell, you are more of an actor in the&#xD;

matter than I am, except the kissing necessary Ott&#xD;
he stage, and that is harmless, for I never kiss&#xD;
here with an appetite. I can say to you what&#xD;
~oriolanus said to Virgilia:&#xD;
'Now, by the jealous Queen of Heaven, that kiss&#xD;
I carried from thee, love, and my true lip&#xD;
Hath virgined it e'er since.'"&#xD;
If the truth must be told, I was about to enact&#xD;
lardanapalus or Coriolanus, whichever the reader&#xD;
)leases, with the lip of the actress again, when, at&#xD;
he moment, Miss Upton entered the room, and&#xD;
~ame directly upon us.&#xD;
"Goodness, gracious!" she exclaimed, putting&#xD;
~er hands before her eyes in affected blushing.-&#xD;
'Excuse rue, IV~r. Russell," and in affected shame&#xD;
rhe glided our of the room.&#xD;
Really amazed I left Miss Watson, wh~ laughed&#xD;
heartily, saying, "Miss Upton would make a good&#xD;
actress," and went to find the manager, whom she&#xD;
was anxious to see.&#xD;
As I descended the steps she called after me:-&#xD;
"I-low would you like~ oh King, to play Sarda-&#xD;
napalus with me once more? and astonish these&#xD;
Washingtonians more than you ever astonished the&#xD;
Baltimoreans."&#xD;
"1 should like to do it," I called back6&#xD;
"Wait till we see the jnanager,~~&#xD;
"it would be first ~ said I to myself as I&#xD;
passed up street. "First rate-~--it seems to me I&#xD;
could play the King better than ever."&#xD;
In half an hour I was conducting ti4~ manager,&#xD;
Mr. Simpson, to Miss Watson, an(l as I left the&#xD;
door of the theatre with him (for we were great&#xD;
friends) Miss Singleton's carriage passed by, with&#xD;
Miss Upton and Alice itt earnest conversation in it.&#xD;
They both, I thought, looked at me, but when I&#xD;
raised ray hat they made no return to my salutation.&#xD;

&#xD;
I must accomplish two things," I said to myself;&#xD;
"reconcile Alice to me and appear as the kingly&#xD;
Sardanapalus on the Washington boards. Hard&#xD;
task. Yet why not accomplish it?"&#xD;
Ill at ease-yet with a kind of not unpleasant&#xD;
excitement either-I put on and put aside almost&#xD;
every neckcloth and vest in my wardrobe before I&#xD;
contented myself as to my toilette, and then it was&#xD;
not contentment, it was resignation; and at the&#xD;
u~naI hour. for calling I sauntered towards Mrs.&#xD;
~ boarding house, to call upon Miss Sin-&#xD;
gleton.&#xD;
As I approached Miss Singleton's parlor I heard&#xD;
her voice in earnest reprehension, and she was&#xD;
saying:&#xD;
"How dare you, Janet, hold conversation at the&#xD;
corners of the streets with any of these persons who&#xD;
call themselves gentemen?~~&#xD;
"They asked me about you, mistress."&#xD;
"How dare they to ask ~rou about me? flush,&#xD;
I don't care to know what their asking might have&#xD;
been. Take' care of yourself, Janet; if you mis-&#xD;
behaVe here, after all the confidence I have placed&#xD;
in you, I'll have nothing more to do with you-&#xD;
you shall  o about your business-I won't own&#xD;
you!"&#xD;
A little bit of a prude thought I, is Miss Single-&#xD;
ton, and 1 suppose should she hear about Alice and&#xD;
myself and Miss Watson-especially should she&#xD;
hear it through Miss Upton-she will take fierce&#xD;
part against me, and the women here will cut me.&#xD;
At this moment Janet came into the passage,&#xD;
and I asked her if her mistress was' in, as I en-&#xD;
tered her parlor. Without the least perturbation&#xD;
of manner my fair representative received me and&#xD;
bade me be seated.&#xD;
"A boon," I said, "Miss Singleton, a boon. I&#xD;
crave it on bended knee," and so saying, and suit-&#xD;
ing the action to the word, I threw myself on my&#xD;
knee before her, with bowed head.&#xD;
"You did that gracefully," said she. "What&#xD;
is the boon? I grant it if it is such as a lady may&#xD;
grant.~~&#xD;
"I want you, I said, to call upon my friend Miss&#xD;
Watson, the celebrated actress."&#xD;
"Why?" she asked.&#xD;

"With the greatest pleasure," 1 said.&#xD;
"I have heard of you two and the freak of your&#xD;

"Ay!" said I. "She wants me to play the king&#xD;
with her-Sardanapalus to her Myrrha"&#xD;
"What! here on the Washington boards?"&#xD;
"Here on the Washington boards!"&#xD;
"Well," said she.&#xD;
"What do you think of it?" said I.&#xD;
"That you should be acting in a higher theatre."&#xD;
"But just for the fun and excitement," I said.&#xD;
"No, sir; there is no fun and excitement in such&#xD;
a thing fbr a gentleman like you, Mr. Russell. If&#xD;
you were poor, had a talent for the stage, and&#xD;
meant to make it your profession, then it were&#xD;
well enough. But I will call upon Miss Watson,&#xD;
for I know I shall like her from what Mrs. Cromp-&#xD;
ton told me. Where is Mr. Sangston?" Miss Sin-&#xD;
gleton asked, after a moments pause.&#xD;
"1 know not," I replied; and at this moment&#xD;
Mr. Dudley and Cotesworth called, and I with-&#xD;
drew. As I was walking along F street in irres-&#xD;
olution as to what I should do, I saw Sangston&#xD;
enter a celebrated Restaurant's, and I stepped in&#xD;
after him. He seemed annoyed when he saw me,&#xD;
but rallying, said:&#xD;
* "Russell, you don't drink?"&#xD;
I shook my head.&#xD;
"Let's step into a private room," said he, and&#xD;
we accordingly did so. Sangston looked sadly, yet&#xD;
there was a defiant air about him, and something&#xD;
which I could not understand.&#xD;
"Do you know that the President has nomina-&#xD;
ted G-, the Secretary, as minister to&#xD;

"My time of triumph has conic. If I cannot&#xD;

you are now among the has beens;-and if I w~&#xD;

jeer you with ~&#xD;

Here a hack driver, who was driving rapidly&#xD;
down the street, leaped from his box, and rushing&#xD;
up to me exclaimed:&#xD;
"Mr. Russell, Mr. Sangston has shot himself!"&#xD;
"Shot himself!" I exclaimed. "Is he dead?"&#xD;
"Dying, sir, dying!"&#xD;
Miss Upton uttered a loud shriek and would&#xD;
have fallen had I exhibited the least hint of an in-&#xD;

"Shot himself! dying!" she exclaime&amp;amp; "Ev-&#xD;
erybody will say its on account of Miss Singleton's&#xD;
treatment of him."&#xD;
Without pausing to say a word to her, I asked&#xD;
the driver where Sangston was. "At your room,&#xD;
sir," he replied.&#xD;
"Drive me there," I said, leaping into his hack.&#xD;
There was a crowd around my hotel, and in it,&#xD;
and all the way up the steps into the room, which&#xD;
was filled almost to suffocation. With, great diffi-&#xD;
culty I pushed through. Sangston was lying gasp-&#xD;
ing on the bed, while the crowd in unthinking and&#xD;
brutal curiosity were hanging so eagerly over him&#xD;
as to take the very breath away from him. With&#xD;
a feeble hand he waved them off. The bar-keepdr,&#xD;
half drunk, with the assistance of some others, had&#xD;
taken off his coat and vest, and the wound, a deli-&#xD;

!" little finger apparently, was exposed, as the bar-&#xD;
keeper was uselessly bathing it with water, for&#xD;
's the bleeding was inwardly. I pushed the crowd&#xD;
at away in that determined manner which is so effi-&#xD;
as cient in crowds, and reached the side ot poor Sangs-&#xD;
~.. ton. He gave me his hand, and made an effort to&#xD;
speak, but his voice was too weak for me to hear&#xD;
him. He made an effort to raise up, but I bent&#xD;
~! my ear to him, and he said:&#xD;
e "Pardon me, Russell-in your room to do this&#xD;
e -it was desperation. Get them out."&#xD;
~    "Gentlemen!" I said, "every one must leave&#xD;
the room."&#xD;
a A few made a move to the door; The rest see~ned&#xD;
e determined to remain. The criminal, morbid and&#xD;
e discourteous curiosity of many people under such&#xD;
circumstances is astonishing. "Gentlemen," ex-&#xD;
claimed I, in a tone of indignation, "this is my&#xD;
room and this gentleman is my friend; you must&#xD;
leave the room, every one of you."&#xD;
My determined manner produced the effect, but&#xD;
they left with reluctance. I locked the door after&#xD;
the last man, nobody remaining but the bar-keeper&#xD;
and myself.&#xD;
"Have you sent for a physician?~~ I asked.&#xD;
"Yes, sir,"said the bar.keeper.-"three of 'em.~&#xD;
Poor Sangston asked for water, and I gave him&#xD;
some.&#xD;
"Its no u~e, Russell," he said. "Its rio use-&#xD;
its mortal-my poor mother-but I was only a tax&#xD;
on her."&#xD;
"Are you in much pain?" I asked.&#xD;
"No, no, not much. Miss Singleton-I should&#xD;
like to see her-my poor mother."&#xD;
Here there was a rap at the door, and a doctor&#xD;
entered; he had scarcely done so when there came&#xD;
another and another. They probed the wound,&#xD;
and their looks plainly betokened a sad result.-&#xD;
Sangston, with feeble breath, asked to be taken to&#xD;
his mother's.&#xD;
"Break it to her as gently as you can, Russell.&#xD;
[am easier-I can stand it-yes, oh take me there~&#xD;
Gentlemen, I am easy now-let me speak to Rus-&#xD;
sell alone-I would be alone with him," he said&#xD;
impatiently.&#xD;
The doctors consulted apart for a moment, and&#xD;
aCte~ leaving some directions which seemed to be&#xD;
of no moment, they withdrew.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
117&#xD;
&#xD;
I followed them into the passage, where the&#xD;
crowd stUl pressed, and conducted them into a va-&#xD;
cant room to ask their opinion. They said, what&#xD;
I had easily surmised, that they could not extract&#xD;
the ball and that the wound was, in all probability,&#xD;
mortal.&#xD;
"Can he be removed to his ~ I asked.&#xD;
"He waists so much to be taken there-it will ease&#xD;
his mind."&#xD;
The physicians thought not now; they would&#xD;
call in the afternoon and decide.&#xD;
"Break it to my mother easily," he said to me,&#xD;
in quite an audible voice, as I re-entered his room&#xD;
"Go, Russell, go yourself and tall her, won't you?&#xD;
Some 'one may blab it out to her, and make it&#xD;
worse." He beckoned me to him. "Put your&#xD;
ear ~ he said, as he waved the bar-keeper&#xD;
away from his bed. "Tell Miss Singleton-you&#xD;
promise me?"&#xD;
"'I promise you," I said, deeply moved.&#xD;
"Tell Miss Singleton that I loved her more than&#xD;
my own soul--that I was not worthy of her. On&#xD;
your honor will you tell her so as soon as you see&#xD;
her? I c6uld die easy could I see her bright face&#xD;
once more, with the smiles on it it used to wear&#xD;
when I was more than her slave! Go, Russell,&#xD;
I proceeded to the bar room to get some proper&#xD;
person to remain with him, and there found Dr.&#xD;
Lockwood. Glad was I of his presence, and at&#xD;
my request he went to the room 'of Sangston, for&#xD;
he was well acquainted with him. Dr. Lockwood,&#xD;
with all his talents, was one of y our ceremonious&#xD;
observers of etiquette. As he had not been sent&#xD;
ftsr-though in a desperate ease, and that in an at-&#xD;
tempt at suicide-he refrained from entering the&#xD;
patients room without being requested to do so,&#xD;
though he had evidently conie to the hotel in his&#xD;
anxiety to know how he was, and the nature of his&#xD;
self-inflicted wounds. It seems that Dr. Lock-&#xD;
wood was not on speaking terms with one of the&#xD;
physicians who had been called, like the others,&#xD;
indiscriminately in, and upon a point of professional&#xD;
feeling, or rather, we should say of professional&#xD;
etiquette as he esteemed it, arising, it may be, out&#xD;
of a misunderstanding as to the administering of a&#xD;
pill in some consultation or other. It appears&#xD;
strange how. such a man could stand aloof from a&#xD;
&#xD;
fellow creature's bed, when his superior skill, as&#xD;
well known to himself as to others, could relieve&#xD;
his pain, perchance save his life. But this was an&#xD;
after reflection; for I threw myself into a hack and&#xD;
drove with all speed to Mrs Sangstoa's. I was&#xD;
spared the pain of communicating the sad intelli-&#xD;
gence to her. Some thoughtless wretchin the fright&#xD;
of the moment, had rushed in and told her that her&#xD;
son had shot himself dead. The bearer of many&#xD;
troubles as she had been, this was too much for&#xD;
her, and she had fainted so lifelessly away that&#xD;
fears for her own life were entertained. I found&#xD;
Miss Singleton and Alice contributing all they&#xD;
could, with-the aid of the servants, to restore her.&#xD;
I offered roy hand to both. Alice seemed to take&#xD;
it mechanically; she seemed so overcome by her&#xD;
feelings. Miss Singleton was calm but white as&#xD;
marble. When Mrs. Sangston at last came to her-&#xD;
self, it was in a kind of stupefaction that she aeked&#xD;
to see Henry, and kept exclaiming "my poor boy&#xD;
my poor boy."&#xD;
With some difficulty 1 placed the afflicted wid-&#xD;
ow, maybe now childless, in the hack, and Miss&#xD;
Singleton with Alice attended her to the hotel-&#xD;
I following in another hack. As I was assisting&#xD;
Mrs. Sangston out, I thought she had recovered&#xD;
very much of her usual energy, for she stepped&#xD;
without assistance into the, hotel. Miss Singleton&#xD;
anti Alice remained in the ladies' parlor, and I at-&#xD;
tended the mother to the bedside of her son.&#xD;
"My dear mother, forgive me," he said, stretch-&#xD;
ing his hand feebly out totake hers.&#xD;
"Oh! Henry, Henry, why did you do this," she&#xD;
said, in tenderness rather than in reproach, as she&#xD;
placed herself beside him.&#xD;
Sangston glanced at the Doctor and his attend-&#xD;
a~it. Dr. Lockwood's quick sense instantly per-&#xD;
ceived that Sangston wished to be left alone with&#xD;
his mother, and making a sign to his attendant, he&#xD;
remarked, "I will return in an instant," and they&#xD;
withdrew. I followed them, Sangeton seeming to&#xD;
wish me to rernainbut his mother desiredI thought.&#xD;
to be alone with him, and I took no notice of his&#xD;
dissent as lie glanced towards the door.&#xD;
In the passage I found Dr. Lockwood. he told&#xD;
me that Sangeton could not possibly live.&#xD;
"I am familiar with gun-shot wounds," said he,&#xD;
"he bleeds inwardly; he suffers little or no painbu&#xD;

THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF&#xD;
&#xD;
toe boast die-I pity his' poor mother-I knew his&#xD;
father well-of a noble nature is Henry, but the&#xD;
example set him here he has followed to his de-&#xD;
struction. It's his mother who is to be pitied."&#xD;
I        I found Miss Sangston alohe in he parlor.&#xD;
"How is he?" she asked.&#xD;
I told her what the Doctor had said, and asked&#xD;
for Alice.&#xD;
"Alice ha~ stepped out to make arrangements&#xD;
for returning with some friends to Baltimore. I fear&#xD;
she has heard bad news. She did not tell me so,&#xD;
but she seetus so sad. She looks ten years older in&#xD;
a day,"&#xD;
A pang, keen as that which from his own hand,&#xD;
the pistol gave to my friend up stairs, pierced my&#xD;
heart for my own folly, or rather I should ~ay vain&#xD;
and giddy recklessness of the feelings of a loving,&#xD;
sensitive and confiding woman. Let me say it-&#xD;
as we sat in silence together, I forgot San gston aud&#xD;
Miss Singleton and thought only of Alice. In five&#xD;
words I told Miss Singleton what had transpired&#xD;
between Alice and myself, and asked what I should&#xD;
do?&#xD;
"Do?" said she, in an almost vehemen t manner;&#xD;
"How dare you act so after all that had passed be-&#xD;
tween you and Alice? How dare you? Poor thing,&#xD;
sh~ slept in my arms that night of my party, and&#xD;
told tne every word that you had said to her-&#xD;
your full explanation of your intimacy with Miss&#xD;
Watson, which had so much grieved her. 1 be'&#xD;
lived your explanation-I believe it now-but&#xD;
think what this poor, dear child has suffered from&#xD;
her impression of your attachment to Miss Watson&#xD;
which grown up with her. Shame on you, sir. She&#xD;
had so frankly consented to marry you, and that&#xD;
so soon-every thing yielded to your impatient and&#xD;
restless spirit-and you to make herso unhappy-&#xD;
when you love her so-oh! shame, shame. Our&#xD;
torture is but your amusement, is that it sir!"&#xD;
Miss Singleton spoke this in such a tone of re-&#xD;
proach that it stung me. and I could not tut reply:&#xD;
"W bile you are heaping such reproaches on me&#xD;
for my levity and recklessness or' the feelings of&#xD;
one who loves me, have you no self-reproaches&#xD;
over the condition of Henry Sangston?"&#xD;
&#xD;
quick by my' own conscience as well as by her&#xD;
words, I could not but make it.&#xD;
She started as if a bullet had reached her heart&#xD;
too, and covering her face with her hands, she&#xD;
ejaculated to h herself in a fearful tone: "My God,&#xD;
my God! Did he send me any word? Tell me&#xD;
everything." I told her every word that he had&#xD;
uttered. She ke1ot her face buried in her hands&#xD;
until I concluded, then tossing back her somewhat&#xD;
disordered hair, airid calming herself, she said:&#xD;
"No, it could not be-he wanted energy-he&#xD;
wanted character--yet his attentions-yes, let me&#xD;
say it, his deep devotion to me, won me into ten-&#xD;
derness at times, whieh. I own, I should not have&#xD;
exhibited-and tIten his dissipation extorted scorn&#xD;
-not to say a loathing from me which I could not&#xD;
at times repress -which, I fear, I did not choose to&#xD;
repress. But I am a monomaniac, it may be, on&#xD;
this vice of intemperance-a monomaniac. I saw&#xD;
my father-a born gentleman man of the noblest&#xD;
impulses and loftiest talents and unbounded wealth&#xD;
-I saw him the victim of this vice-made by it&#xD;
cruel to his sla~;es and unkind to his wife-the&#xD;
murderer of his friend in an unrighteous duel and&#xD;
a death untd him self. Were Henry Sangston now&#xD;
all my father wa s in intellect, in address, in wealth,&#xD;
and in position, and had he this vice, I would not,&#xD;
I could not, so help me heaven, have married him.&#xD;
My t~ain ted mot her, who is in heaven, forbids me.&#xD;
But without thi s vice, humlAe as Henry Sangston&#xD;
is in this ~vorld' s goods, and in this world's honors,&#xD;
I would have gi yen ~iim my hand with my heart in&#xD;
it. DAy' friend,'' she said, "I honor your resolute&#xD;
nature. You an d Alice must not torture each oth-&#xD;
er any more," sh e exclaimed vehemently.&#xD;
At this moth ent Mrs. Sangeton entered the&#xD;
room. She said that Henry wanted to see me.&#xD;
"If my poor boy' should grow worse let me know,&#xD;
I charge you," she said.&#xD;
As I left the roowl I heard her say:&#xD;
"Oh, Miss Single ton, if you knew how my poor&#xD;
boy Loved you."&#xD;
I found Sangston astonishingly calm. He showed&#xD;
mor e character with tI ic hand of death on him than&#xD;
I h ad ever known him exhibit before. He spoke&#xD;
iiiz.~ ~ne u~t..~ knew 1.i~ hrnirs were niimhered. and&#xD;
&#xD;
I own that this was a most unkind and improper ~ve me but few; and as Ii seated myself on the bed&#xD;
inquiry under the circumstances, but stung to the~~~de him, and todk this hand, as Dr. Lockwood,&#xD;

&#xD;
who seemed to have an instinct in such matters,&#xD;
left the room and closed the door after him, he said:&#xD;
"Russell, it is easier t&amp;amp; die than you think for,"&#xD;
-and a smile of bitterness passed over his face, as&#xD;
he contiuued:-"when you have nothing to live&#xD;
for. After you left me here I saw Miss Molesby-&#xD;
I told her to get Cambden to vote against the see-&#xD;
retary-I told her how she could do it. She likes&#xD;
me-there is at least one woman that likes me-&#xD;
but she is jealous of Miss Singleton-she thinks as&#xD;
she likes me that other women must like me also.&#xD;
2 She refused to do what I asked her most perempto-&#xD;
rily-we quarrelled-I drank, drank, drank, when&#xD;
I returned to your room-knew where your pistols&#xD;
were-and this is the result."&#xD;
It was deep in the night of this same day.-&#xD;
~Sangston had insisted, upon being removed to his&#xD;
mother's, and his mother had resolved to gratify&#xD;
him, though the physicians had advised to the con&#xD;
trary~ Miss Singleton had prevailed on Alice to&#xD;
remain, and Sangaton had expressed the wish to&#xD;
see Miss Singleton before he died; and she had ta-&#xD;
ken Alice with her into his room. lie was too weak&#xD;
to speak when Miss Singleton entered, but he took&#xD;
her hand and held it close in his, while the unut..&#xD;
terable longing and tenderness with which ho&#xD;
gazed with hi~ glazing eye into her face is daguer-&#xD;
reotyped on my memory now. The Rev. Mr. F-&#xD;
of the Episcopal Church, had impressively prayed&#xD;
beside him; and, raising himself up, he took his&#xD;
mother's hand and placing it in that of Miss Single-&#xD;
ton, he closed his eyes in his last sleep so gently that&#xD;
we knew not at first that his spirit had departed.&#xD;
That night I was setting up wit~ the corpse of&#xD;
the poor suicide. It was after midnight. Alice&#xD;
was staying with Miss Singleton, and the whole&#xD;
house had retired to rest except the watcher with&#xD;
me and myself, when Janet entered the room in&#xD;
which we were sitting, next to that in which the&#xD;
body was laid out, and said that she had heurd the&#xD;
bell and had stepped to the door and that there&#xD;
was a lady in the passage who wanted to see me.&#xD;
Wondering who it could be, I passed into the pas..&#xD;
sage. A thickly-veiled lady st~od before mewhom&#xD;
I knew at a glance to be Miss Molesby. but as her&#xD;
disguise showed that she did not wish to be recog-&#xD;
nized, I merely bowed to her and asked her com-&#xD;
inands.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
friend of Mr. Sangaton's, sir-I&#xD;
disturb his family or friends-but I should like&#xD;
the way by the passage door so as not to&#xD;
my friend in the next room, and entering&#xD;
that where the body lay, I pointed to it without&#xD;
saying a word. She spoke not, but uncovering the&#xD;
face she gazed on it earnestly, and, as I thought,&#xD;
with a look of resolution which surprised me.&#xD;
Taking a pair of scissors from her bosom she cut a&#xD;
lock of his hair and withdraw before I could step to&#xD;
her side to open the door for her.&#xD;
The next day, in the afternoon, Sangston was&#xD;
buried in the Congress burying ground. I rode&#xD;
out with Mr. Cotcsworth and another. The chat&#xD;
about worldly matters which is always rife at fun-&#xD;
erals-mayhe we would drive away the sadness of&#xD;
the occasion-was on this occasion about the mm-&#xD;
isterial nomination of G-. as minister abroad..-..  N&#xD;
"I understand old Cambden made a glorious speech&#xD;
against him this morning-glorious," said Cotes-     2&#xD;
worth. "He got him rejected. The old fellow,&#xD;
for one of his years, is too much of roue, I admit;&#xD;
but we all have our faults and he is a true patriot."&#xD;
When we reached the ground I saw a solitary&#xD;
carriage nol far from the gate, in which was a sol-&#xD;
itary female. I surmised who it was. As the pro-&#xD;
3ession was forming to go to the grave she beck-&#xD;
oned to me. I stepped for a moment to the side of&#xD;
the carriage which was not far off.&#xD;
"Mr. Russell," she said with a look almost of&#xD;
exultation, "I have revenged your friend-a proper&#xD;
part for me one would say-I trust Miss Singleton&#xD;
will perform her part and support the poor widow.&#xD;
whose son's heart she has broken."&#xD;
Sadder and wiser grew one and all under this&#xD;
affliction. Alice and I were entirely reconciled,&#xD;
and I returned with her and Miss Singleton to Bal-&#xD;
timore, where, aided by the powerful influence of&#xD;
that lady, Alice was persuaded upon to give me&#xD;
her hand "before the holy man" within a week&#xD;
after our arrival.&#xD;
Gentle reader, we part now, but I trust only for&#xD;
a season. Dangers and deaths and temptations and&#xD;
trials and triumphs are before me, should I ever&#xD;
recount them to you;-but until I can take up my&#xD;
pen with less interruption than now, I must bid&#xD;
you adieu.&#xD;
