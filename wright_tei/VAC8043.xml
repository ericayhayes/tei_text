Although  this good lady was ten&#xD;

had left a snow-flake amid her dark&#xD;
and glossy hair,&#xD;
" Grace was in her step, heaven in her ey..,&#xD;

gested the idea of a beautiful woman,&#xD;
of mature age, in whose pure heart&#xD;
dwelt the heavenly attributesof kind-&#xD;
ness, simplicity and Christian virtue.&#xD;
The worthy lady kissed our hero&#xD;
tend rly, when he informed her that&#xD;
he was slightly unwell.&#xD;

she, "and I must Bend for Dr. 1u-&#xD;

Gallus Kate received our hero in&#xD;

Snatiument constructed upon the prin -&#xD;

of our hero's thumbs;' and then screw-&#xD;
ed it up until it produced the mop&#xD;

officers.&#xD;
Jack made no answer.&#xD;
"Give the- screw  another turn,&#xD;
Jessop-damn him, we'll cure him&#xD;

Another turn was given to the in-&#xD;
strument, almost. crushing the thumb&#xD;
between its iron jaws. Jack quivered&#xD;
in every limb with intense agony, and&#xD;
turned deadly pale.&#xD;
"1Will you divulge those secrets?"&#xD;
"No-a million times, no!" cx-&#xD;
claimed Jack, and then fainted away.&#xD;
"1Gallant fellow!" murmured th3&#xD;
officer-" take off the thumb-screw,,&#xD;

brandy down his throat. He'll soon'&#xD;

This was done, and in a few min-&#xD;
utes the boy recovered sufficiently to&#xD;
sit up, although he was very weak.&#xD;
"Now, my lad," said the officer,&#xD;
with a sternness of tone that was&#xD;
evidently assumed-" since torture&#xD;
will not wring from you the informa-&#xD;

&#xD;
" This was done, and Jack felt the&#xD;
cold steel pressing against his head.&#xD;
The officer took out his watch, and&#xD;
said.&#xD;
"It now lacks precisely three&#xD;
minutes of one o'clock. If, vhen&#xD;
the minute hand of this watch&#xD;
reaches the figure one, you do not&#xD;
consent to do as we request, the&#xD;
man. who holds that pistol will blow&#xD;
out your brains. You hear, Moody?"&#xD;
" Aye, aye, sir 1 was the gruff&#xD;
response."&#xD;
" When I give the word fire, pull&#xD;
the trigger 1"&#xD;
"i've always larnt to obey orders,&#xD;
sir," said Moody, whose finger pess'&#xD;
ed hard against the trigger of the&#xD;
pistol.&#xD;
A brief pause ensued.&#xD;
"One minute has passed," said&#xD;
the officer.&#xD;
Jack merely smiled.&#xD;
Another pause, during which the&#xD;
rapid ticking of the watch could be&#xD;
distinctly heard, so profound was&#xD;
.the silence that prevailed.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Two minutes have passed, and&#xD;
but one now remains," said the&#xD;
oficer.&#xD;
Jack, pale as death, placed his&#xD;
hand upon 'his heart, as if to still&#xD;
its violent throbbings, and forced&#xD;
another smile.&#xD;
An awful pause followed, and&#xD;
a silence unbroken, save by the&#xD;
ticking of that watch, which sound-&#xD;
ed like a race-horse galloping to&#xD;
eternity with an eternal soul,&#xD;

that he was his destined companion iii&#xD;

The new comer was a youth of ap&#xD;
parently the same age as our hero-&#xD;
and an uncommonly handsome young&#xD;
fellow he nas, with fine features, fair&#xD;
codnplexioni, an abundance; of curly&#xD;
hairy and very graceful form. Hi.&#xD;
dress was elegant, and appropriate to&#xD;
his years; and .his whole appearance&#xD;
was singularly prepossessing. Having&#xD;
seated himself at a solitary table, he&#xD;
called for a glass of wine; and while&#xD;
sipping it, he surveyed the company&#xD;
with a careless, ha ghty glakee.  For&#xD;
a moment his eyes rested  yoh Jack&#xD;

&#xD;
Our hero had' in his possession a&#xD;
piece of candle, and the means of&#xD;
procuring a light. These he put into&#xD;
inmediate use, and then entered the&#xD;
room, which was fitted up as a; library,&#xD;
and was employed by Mr. Harold as&#xD;
a quiet and convenient retreat, when!&#xD;
he wished to read, or transact private&#xD;
business.&#xD;
Approachinga desk, Jack selected&#xD;
a key from the bunch, and unlocked&#xD;
it without difficulty. He then opened&#xD;
a small compartment in the desk, and&#xD;
to his inexpressible delight, found a&#xD;
considerable sum of money in bank&#xD;
notes and gold. These he quickly&#xD;
transferred to his pockets, and then&#xD;
began to examine the contents of va-&#xD;
rious small drawers, in one of which&#xD;
he discovered a sealed package.&#xD;
"We'll soon see what this con-&#xD;
tains," thought Jack; and breaking&#xD;
it open, a fine gold locket was reveal-&#xD;
ed to his gase, enclosing the portrait,&#xD;
of a young and beautiful female, with&#xD;
deap blua eyes and sunny hair. At-&#xD;
tachod to the locket was a faded rib-&#xD;

claim the offspring of her unholy love.&#xD;
the infant is one month old, and is chris-&#xD;
tened John."&#xD;
" Heavens!" thought Jack-"these&#xD;
papers must allude to me!" And he&#xD;
continued the perusal of the first note&#xD;
which he knew to be in th     hand-&#xD;
writing of Mr. Harold:--&#xD;
" We clefermined to cherish and rear the&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;
&#xD;
Showing the hero of this narrative in a&#xD;
" tight fix," and showing also how he got&#xD;
out of it.&#xD;
An old newspa per, dated 20 years&#xD;
ago, (1830) which invaluable doeu-&#xD;
ment is now in our possession, con-&#xD;
tains the following, among other&#xD;
items of criminal intelligence:-&#xD;
John, otherwise Jack Harold, was&#xD;
found guilty of an extensive rob.&#xD;
bery from the premises of his adopt.&#xD;
ed father, Henry Harold, Esq., gen-&#xD;
tieman; .at the intercession of the&#xD;
.prosecuo rAIn  consideration of&#xD;
the exÂ±rnoyouth of the prisoner,&#xD;
he was sent to the House of Refuge&#xD;
for Juvenile Delinquents, there to&#xD;
remain until he attains his majority,&#xD;
or until his good behavior will war-&#xD;
rant the overseers in binding him as&#xD;
an apprentice to some useful trade.&#xD;
"The prisoner, although a lad of&#xD;
4n extremely preposessing appear.&#xD;
~nee, is a, most hardened young&#xD;
dog ;' for on receiving his sentence,&#xD;
he had the audacity to makelseveral&#xD;
very insulting remarks to the bench,&#xD;
&#xD;
among other thiitigs, that he wE&#xD;
have the felicity oftdanq'ng (o&#xD;

and seriously damaging his nc&#xD;

this desperate young reprobat&#xD;
And now, reader, havmn sa&#xD;
posited master Jack within t&#xD;
of an institution especially d&#xD;
for the reformiadon 'of such j&#xD;
rascals as he, we might with&#xD;
show of propriety leave him&#xD;
fate, and close our narrative a&#xD;
trusting that subsequent goo&#xD;
viour on his part might enable&#xD;
avoid the ignominious end&#xD;

made him ramble, not' only :or }'is&#xD;
liberty, 'but also for his life. {&#xD;
This was the "barking of a tremen-&#xD;
dous bull-dog. Jack knew   he was&#xD;
tremendous, by tt depth and power&#xD;
of the sound   antg he feared, if the&#xD;
animal were (oqggehe would be torn&#xD;
in pieces, as he imelhtirely nitarmed.'&#xD;
While' delibdr ming,, o  the 'best&#xD;
course to pursuein :this emergency,&#xD;
his foot came in contact with a stone&#xD;
of considerable size. This he raised&#xD;
with both hands, and poised it on&#xD;
high, at arms' length, determined to&#xD;
give the savage brute a warm recep-&#xD;
tion, should he he attacked.&#xD;
. He soon had reason to congratulite&#xD;
himself on ha'ng taken this preceu-&#xD;
tion-for a I o, deep, ferocious growl&#xD;
assumed him that his enemy was 'near.&#xD;
Suddenly two huge paws were placed&#xD;
upon his breast-and just as the dog;&#xD;
was about to fasten his teeth in Jack's&#xD;
throat, down came the heavy stone&#xD;
with tremendous force upon his head,&#xD;
felling him to the ground, and killing&#xD;
him instantly.&#xD;
Thanking his lucky stars for this&#xD;
deliverance, our hero resumed his&#xD;
search for the door of the yard ; when&#xD;
all at once he was startled by the ap-&#xD;
pearance of a half-dressed man with a&#xD;
light in his hand, at a little distance,&#xD;
who rubbed his eyes, and seemed to&#xD;
have been just awakened from a sound&#xD;
sleep,Â°&#xD;
" Devil take the dog I" muttered&#xD;
the man-" he has woke me up from&#xD;
a good snooze, by his infernal bark-&#xD;
ing and growling. Wonder what's&#xD;
the matter:"&#xD;
As he spoke, he raised up his&#xD;
lanthern, and endeavored te peer into&#xD;
she  surrounding  darkness.  Jack'&#xD;
crouched down close to the wall, and&#xD;
fortunately escaped observation&#xD;
"1Where -thedevil's the dog?" con-&#xD;
tinued the fellow, in a grumbling&#xD;
tone. "Here, Tiger, Tiger I Where&#xD;

had playe'- upon the o"erseer would&#xD;
render that gentleman furioa .against&#xD;
him. He would be whipped, *tarved,&#xD;
chained, and so closely confined, that&#xD;
all future attempts at escape would be&#xD;
perfectly abortive.&#xD;
But not long did he deliberate; for&#xD;
his ready mind soon suggested a plan&#xD;
of operation.&#xD;
"One, thing is certain," ..ought&#xD;
he: "the key of this gate must be in&#xD;
the possession of the porter. That&#xD;
key I must obtain, at all risks-even&#xD;
if I have to commit murder; so here&#xD;
goes !"&#xD;
le pressed against the window of&#xD;
the lodge ; it yielded, for it had' for-&#xD;
tunately been left unfastened. On,&#xD;
looking in, he beheld the man stretch-&#xD;
ed, upon his bed, evidently . sound'&#xD;
asleep.          .&#xD;
Summcning to his assistance all his&#xD;
resolution andcourage, Jack Harold.&#xD;
crawled softly through the window,t&#xD;
and stood within the lodge..&#xD;
The porter was a large, powerful&#xD;
man, and thte dim light from the Ian-r&#xD;
tern, shining upon his face, revealed t&#xD;
his stern ,and determined features..--&#xD;
Our hero instantlysaw that a person- .&#xD;
al conflict with such a stout fellow t&#xD;
would be fatal to his hopes. The&#xD;
man could only be overcome by inor- f&#xD;
al heroism.&#xD;
The first object that attracted e&#xD;
Jack's attention, was a blunderbuss b&#xD;
which rested upon a shelf, directly&#xD;
over the sleeper's head. To gain ~&#xD;
possession of this formidable weapon g&#xD;
was the boy's first object; but in order o&#xD;
to reach it, he was obliged to lean over&#xD;
the t'", in doing which his person ti&#xD;
came in contact with the porter', t&#xD;
hand. ' iThe man stirred, 'half woke 3&#xD;
up, muttered an incoherent word or -&#xD;
two, and went off again to the land&#xD;
of dreans.                        ti&#xD;
Jack was now armed; and as he n&#xD;
cocked the" blusderbuss, his brave t&#xD;
heart swelled wih 'delight; -,fq  he b&#xD;
&#xD;
fel4 that he was =now the hero of'&#xD;
daring and perllous adventure.&#xD;
SIl b    great than yet," thought&#xD;
he. ".Wh l  yda  on my yc  would&#xD;

'pshaw ! 'this -is 'Ito time- to shed&#xD;

He' began 'a lese and careful&#xD;
search for the all-important article,&#xD;
not- forgetting to hold the -blunder-&#xD;
buss in readiness, in case the porter&#xD;
should awaken. ie determined td'&#xD;

In vain he searched ; he could&#xD;

opened every drawer, and -dxamined&#xD;
every place, wherein it was likely to&#xD;
be laid away.&#xD;
Jack grew desperate-for the'first&#xD;

Having warmed and dried himself,&#xD;
he went tone of' the windows and&#xD;
f1-Looked forth. The rain still descend-&#xD;
red in, torrents ; and. the wild, open&#xD;
*country looked dreary indeed-for at&#xD;
hat period the environs round about&#xD;
New York were but thinly settled.&#xD;
While gazing forth   upon -the&#xD;
gloomy prospect, Jack had the satis-&#xD;
factionofseeing Piggot end company&#xD;
issue fromthe gardenand wend their&#xD;
way towards the Refuge. They had&#xD;
at lhngth :'abandoned the search and&#xD;
were returning to the -prison--and&#xD;
being wrn out with fatigue, wet to&#xD;
the skim and soured by disappoint-&#xD;
menit,' they made a very mniserable&#xD;
appearance as they slowi ly loadedd&#xD;
onwards. Jack could,not help laugh-&#xD;
ing as he observed Mir. Piggot wit Ii&#xD;
his hand'applied to his wounded eye,&#xD;
~ =       while'the g -tekeeper limped pain-'&#xD;
fully upon his bruised shin. Soon&#xD;
they turned the corner, and were out&#xD;
of sight.&#xD;
At this moment Jack was startled&#xD;
by the sound of foot-steps ascending&#xD;
the stairs ; his first impulse was to&#xD;
conceal himself, and he quickly step-&#xD;
ped into a snall closet which adjoin-&#xD;
ed the chamber.,&#xD;
This apartment was a sort of dress-&#xD;
ing-roomi, arid was separated from&#xD;
the clamber by a glass door, fur-&#xD;
nished with a curtain. Jack slightly&#xD;
drew aside the curtainand saw the&#xD;
young lady whorn he had sees at the&#xD;
breaktirst table, enter the "chamber,&#xD;
and seat herself before the fire in&#xD;
the rocking-chair which he had just&#xD;
quitted.&#xD;
That she was very unhappy, re-j&#xD;
quired but little penetration to dis-&#xD;
3over, even had not the fact been;&#xD;
.nade evident by the   tear.' that&#xD;
coursed down her cheeks. Uncon-&#xD;
scious of the presence of a witness&#xD;
to her grief, she murmured, in a&#xD;
voice rendered indistinct by agoniz-&#xD;
og sobs--&#xD;
"' As. ;iuhai py w retch that aml!&#xD;

while my heart is rent asunder with&#xD;
remorse and grief!&#xD;
".And yet my conscience doth not&#xD;
reproach me with having been wil.&#xD;
fully guilty; for did I not fall a vice&#xD;
tim to the specious arts of a villain:&#xD;
Did not his intoxicating flatteries, his&#xD;
expressions of ardent love, his fer-&#xD;
vent entreaties, and his solemn prom-&#xD;
ises of marriage, alone enable him&#xD;
to triumph over my principles of&#xD;
virtue!&#xD;
"' Eleven years have elapsed since&#xD;
that fatal night, when-in this very&#xD;
chaber, to which he gained admis-&#xD;
eian-,John Hamblin robbed me of&#xD;
that purity of soul and person that&#xD;
can never be restored.   I then&#xD;
thought him to be the soul of honor;&#xD;
he has since proved to be a despica-&#xD;
ble villain, worthy of'all the hatred&#xD;
which I now feel towards him.&#xD;
" My kind parents never suspected&#xD;
the frailty of their daughter; for&#xD;
when that daughter's condition began&#xD;
to grow obvious, she left this roof,&#xD;
under pretence of passing a few&#xD;
months with an old school-fellow anno&#xD;
friend. Her seducer caused her to&#xD;
be conveyed to the hoi.se of a cer-&#xD;
tain female, and there the erring girl&#xD;
became the mother of a male child.&#xD;
To retain the infant, the evidence of&#xD;
her 'shame, in her possession, was&#xD;
impossible; her desire to preserve&#xD;
her reputation triumphed over the&#xD;
promptings of maternal love. W heh&#xD;
the babe was one morth old, the un-&#xD;
happy mother placed her own por-&#xD;
trait about its neck, together with a&#xD;
note imploring charity; and Then one&#xD;
night she left the .little innocent at&#xD;
the door of a rich man's house.&#xD;
Whether it was kindly received, or&#xD;
consigned to the harsh mercy of an&#xD;
alhs house, the poor motleer never&#xD;
learned; and though her soi often&#xD;
yearns for the offspring of .et tan&#xD;

"Perhaps, too, he would invoke&#xD;
eirses on my head, for bringing him&#xD;
into a world where he suffers under&#xD;
'he  hateful stain of illegitimacy.&#xD;
Yes - it is far better that we should&#xD;
never behold each other.&#xD;
"But, oh! my God! how the awful&#xD;
consequences of that false step still&#xD;
cling to me! My seducer, and the&#xD;
father of my dhild--John flamblin-&#xD;
he who wrested from me the treas-&#xD;
ures of my virgin innocence-has&#xD;
proved himself to be a monster of'&#xD;
villainy, an outcast, a robber, and a&#xD;
felon. Not content with having ef-&#xD;

me the constant victim of his vio-&#xD;

How little parents dream that&#xD;
such a blacke ed ruffian is so often&#xD;
beneath their (roof, in the chamber'&#xD;

think to be ppre as snow! How&#xD;
little do they suspect that their&#xD;

from them secretely, in order to fur-1&#xD;

able him to pursue his infamous I&#xD;

forced to endure his odious embraces,&#xD;
when his very touch is pollution, and&#xD;
when I detest him with all the inten-&#xD;

Miss Cooper drew from her bosom&#xD;
a purse, and without saying a word,&#xD;
gave it to 'her-persecutor, who exami-&#xD;

" Perdition! here are but aÂ° few&#xD;

not disposed to dispute the point&#xD;

The Prince approhehed her, and&#xD;
grasped her fiercely by' the arm:r&#xD;
Jack Harold ground his teeth, and&#xD;
viewed the scene with flashing eyes.&#xD;

Miss Cooper was profoundly agi-&#xD;

CHAPTER XIII,&#xD;
Interview between Jack and "Hii Royal&#xD;
Highness- !&#xD;
This, villainous effusion, being well&#xD;
adapted to the feelings and tastes of&#xD;
the company, was received with&#xD;
boisterous applause; and the Rev.&#xD;
Mr. Sniffy looked the very picture&#xD;
of vanity--allowing that vanity  was&#xD;
ever seen " tight as a peep,'t' with&#xD;
a short pipe in its mouth, which&#xD;
was, the precise-condition-of the rev.&#xD;
erend gentleman, after he had fin-&#xD;
ished his song.&#xD;
The Princo now announced that it&#xD;
was time for the company to sepa.&#xD;
gate; and in a.few minutes the place&#xD;
was deserted, save by "H is Royal&#xD;
Highness," and Jack Harold, who&#xD;
vas awakened    from   his slumbers&#xD;
by the noise, made by the departing&#xD;
tNieves. We must not forget One&#xD;
Arm'd Bill, however, who lay snoring&#xD;
beneath the table.&#xD;
The Prince turned to our hero, and&#xD;
fpr som minutes regarded him with&#xD;
t stern look, which Jack repaid by&#xD;
an expression of hatred and con-&#xD;
tempt.&#xD;
At length the Prince said, in a tone&#xD;
which he vainly strove to -reader&#xD;
calum           .. ,&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
* Coas, 1  , we are alone now,&#xD;

adjoins that lady's chamber, intend.&#xD;

I might depart with safety; For&#xD;
reasons which I don't choose to tell.,&#xD;
I did not depart at dark, but remain-&#xD;

"And why the hell did yo inter-&#xD;

fect phrenzy of rage, for Jc 's tone&#xD;
of calm defiance maddened bI m.&#xD;
The hot blood of indignati on red-&#xD;
dened our hero's face, as. he: re-&#xD;
plied--&#xD;
" I should have proved myself al..&#xD;
post as miserablea coward as  you&#xD;
are, if I had not interfered, when 1,&#xD;
saw a rutiarn assaulting a defenceless&#xD;
woman."&#xD;
" Insolent young cur(l he sall pay&#xD;
a'r this!" muttered the Prince, from&#xD;
between his clenched teeth.&#xD;
'"And, besides," continued ack--&#xD;
I had a particular reason  or de-&#xD;
fecding that lady,; above p) ,other&#xD;
women in the world."&#xD;
" And that reason-.wha t Was it?' .&#xD;

The walls were covered with color-,&#xD;
ed paper, ornamented .with coarse&#xD;
figures; and in passing his hand over,&#xD;
the surface, our hero discovered a&#xD;
small iron projection, resembling a'&#xD;
nail. This he pressed, and instantly&#xD;
a door noiselessly opened, revealing a&#xD;
dark, narrow passage, just high, and&#xD;
wide enough to admit the body of a&#xD;
man.&#xD;
Taking the candle to light his way,&#xD;
Jack fearlessly entered the. pass ige.&#xD;
After proceeding a short distance, he&#xD;
came to a flight of stairs, which he de-&#xD;
scended with extreme caution, as lie&#xD;
distinctly heard voices as if ir conver-&#xD;
sation. His progress was saiddenly&#xD;
arrested by a door, partially open;&#xD;
and having extinguished his, light, he&#xD;
paused to listen&#xD;
Prom his positan, he had a tolerar&#xD;
ble view of the apartment, which he&#xD;
surmised to be the chamber of the&#xD;
Prince. It was furnished with con-&#xD;
siderable luxury. Upon a table that&#xD;
stood in the middle of the, room was&#xD;
placed a globe light; and at the table&#xD;
were seated two men, whom Jack had&#xD;
no difficulty in recognizing as"* His&#xD;
Royal Highness " and "One Arm 'd&#xD;
Bill."&#xD;
An object that lay upon the table&#xD;
attracted the boy's eanest attention,&#xD;
and, in spite of all his courage,, made&#xD;
his blood run. cold. It was a long,&#xD;
littering. murderous looking Bowie.&#xD;

"Infernal scoundrel!I your villainy.&#xD;

"Well, captain," said Bill-'" the&#xD;

"Oh, certainly ; you shall have&#xD;

because 'he rejoiced in the pros-&#xD;

than all, how distinctly visible were&#xD;
the snowy treasures of her divine bust,&#xD;
disclosed by the loose and voluptuous&#xD;
negligence of her elegant robe of daz-&#xD;
alin whiteness I Long end ardently&#xD;
did Igaze upon the celestial vision ;&#xD;
at length she burst into a silvery laugh.&#xD;
"'Poor wretch !' she exclaimed, in&#xD;
a tone of mock pity--of all tones in&#xD;

"Again she laughed heartily.  By&#xD;
God l from behind the curtains of my&#xD;
wife's bed came the sound of another&#xD;
laugh. I recognized the tones. 'hey&#xD;

rushed in and strangled the paramour&#xD;
of my wife; but her deadly and up=&#xD;

bottled up my wrath for a future day.&#xD;
Pursued by the mocking laughter of&#xD;
the guilty couple, I sought my own&#xD;
chamber, 'and passed the night in&#xD;
groans, curses, and oaths of ven.&#xD;

Here the Prince arose, and began&#xD;
to pace the room with agitated foot-&#xD;
steps. Jack Harold distinctly heard&#xD;
and saw everything that passed, and&#xD;
hegin to be much interested in his&#xD;
father's narrative.&#xD;
"Captain," exclaimed One Arm'd&#xD;

a kind of lethargy into which he had&#xD;
fallen--"- o you know wot 'd a-done&#xD;

"Np-.what would you have done?"&#xD;
demanded he Prince, with soie curi-&#xD;

-fully place it upon the table; he then&#xD;
wiped.his lips with the sleeve of his&#xD;
jacket, no ded his head thrice, in a&#xD;
manner thrt was designed to be in'&#xD;

In her struggles, Kate had shifted&#xD;
her position to the further side of the&#xD;

the piety or her housekeeper&#xD;
It is quite unnecessary that the read-&#xD;
ers of this story should-be informed of&#xD;
the "why and the wherefore " of Mr.&#xD;
Henry haroid's departure for Eu-&#xD;
rope, which took place at about this&#xD;
period ; and, to confess the truth, we&#xD;
neither know, nor care to know, the&#xD;
particular reason of his going. As&#xD;
he was unaccompanied by his lady,&#xD;
we presume that is object was one of&#xD;
business, not of pleasure; for surely&#xD;
he could not have enjoyed the gaieties;&#xD;
of Paris, the " sights " of London, or&#xD;

the wonders and the beauties of the&#xD;
old world. -Our private opinion is,&#xD;
'bat he went td take possession of a&#xD;

Be that as it may, to Europe did&#xD;
Mr. Henry Harold go, leaving his&#xD;
lay to await his return with impa..&#xD;

w ith her books, her musie   jr&#xD;

sh e had long moved as the "bright,&#xD;

al who knew   her by her moral ex-&#xD;
c llence, elevated virtue, 'and, in&#xD;
short, by the possession of eery am-&#xD;
iable and lovely trait that cin adorn&#xD;
the female character.&#xD;
Mrs. Harold was now ab ut forty&#xD;
years of age, yet she was a ill what&#xD;
thy world calls an exceedingly fine&#xD;
woman, possessing an order f beauty&#xD;
re arkably voluptuous. Sh  always&#xD;
dr ssed  ith the most perfect taste&#xD;
and ele ance; preferring a refined&#xD;
simplicity in her attire, rathe than a&#xD;
gaudy display. It was at tiat time&#xD;
the fashion among ladies t exhibit,&#xD;
for tile gratification of their  ale ac.&#xD;
quaintances, and also to promote their&#xD;
" conquests," their uncovered necks&#xD;
&#xD;
and a libYci pcr tor of i:heir bosoms,;,&#xD;

'Alas! beauty is a fatalhgift, fhr&#xD;

a shameful life, or a miserable NgJ&#xD;
An ugly woman should be haspy in}&#xD;
her ugliness, for she is not I, ,ble, to&#xD;
be tempted to her ruin by f i ie, de-&#xD;

her pure soul the inhabitant of a dis-&#xD;

cases of forcible violation, but efer to&#xD;
instances which have been brought&#xD;
before our criminal courts, therein&#xD;
beasts in, human form have succeeded&#xD;
in their diabolical designs, in conse-&#xD;
quence of having administered to their.&#xD;
victims certain drugs, which either'&#xD;
excite  an  excessive  amativeness,&#xD;
amounting to insanity, or else pro-&#xD;
duce total insensibility.&#xD;
Lopez the. Spaniard had long re-&#xD;
garded Mrs. Harold with a lascivious&#xD;
eye  His occupation as a gardener,&#xD;
and his extraordinary skill in rearing&#xD;
flowers, very frequently brought him&#xD;
tn contact with the lady, who almost&#xD;
worshipped the sweet offerings ofFloe&#xD;
i, and delighted to watch their growth&#xD;
and progress towards perfection. She&#xD;
loved to question the man concerning&#xD;
the peculiar properties of rare plants;&#xD;
and firmly believing him to be a very&#xD;
worthy, honest fell ,w, her manner to-&#xD;
wards him was ever kind and conde-&#xD;
scending. She even treated him with&#xD;
an innocent familiarity, which ladies&#xD;
in her sphere seldom show to a medial,&#xD;
and which the exceeding goodness of&#xD;
her pure heart au)ne suggested.&#xD;
&#xD;
Vt&#xD;

&#xD;
The day, before the:depature I4&#xD;
Mr. Harold, that gentleman sought-an&#xD;
interview  with  his e garden  and&#xD;
said&#xD;
"W3et . Lopeztmy good fellow, to-&#xD;

must be the protector of this&#xD;
hold---you must, to, soui ext&#xD;
my place ; and .I am ,ettai n:&#xD;

Af er some further conversation&#xD;
which it is unnecessary for us toie.&#xD;
peat, Mr. Harold shook hands with&#xD;
Lopez, bade him good-bye, and left&#xD;
him.&#xD;
" Ho, ho!" muttered the false&#xD;
Spgniard-" he wants rme to fillit&#xD;

do it more literally than he expects!'&#xD;
The next morning the good ship&#xD;
"Samaritan" sailed for England&#xD;
with Mr. Harold on board; and that&#xD;
afternoon his lady, as was her cus.&#xD;

"Well," cried the' housekeeper,&#xD;
seating herself upon the side of the&#xD;

with her aproi-" hepa a perity&#xD;
kettle of 6sh, to be sure! ,ou could&#xD;

Mrs. arold in open day-light, n&#xD;
lay o6br filthy paw upon her.  Ugh,&#xD;
you brute !'&#xD;
Why, mother Rogers, what the&#xD;
devil-"&#xD;
"4Mother, indeed! How dare you&#xD;
apply that word to me, when you;&#xD;
know that I am a lady of middle age!&#xD;
But, old as I am, you ungrateful&#xD;
monster, you have always been hap-&#xD;
Py to enjoy my Favors, and have&#xD;
sworn by all the saints in your calen-&#xD;
der, that you loved me to distrac-&#xD;
tion. Can you deny all this?"&#xD;
The gardener made no reply, but&#xD;
very  deliberately  mixed  another&#xD;
tumbler of brandy and water. This&#xD;
done, he seated himself at the side&#xD;
of the indignant lady, and encircled&#xD;
her plump waist with his arm. - Then&#xD;
he raised the tumbler of grog to her&#xD;
lips, and she, nothing loth, imbibed&#xD;
every drop of the anti-temperance&#xD;
compound.   The   change  in her&#xD;
temper and demeanor, effected by&#xD;
this ingenious mode of treatment,&#xD;
.as marvellous.  Her ruddy face&#xD;
relaxed into a smile, and she regard-&#xD;
ed Lopez with an affectionate, even&#xD;
an amorous look. Finally, when the&#xD;
gardener imprinted several. kisses&#xD;
upon her lips, she could contain her-&#xD;
self no longer, but threw herself into&#xD;
his arms and declared him to be a&#xD;
"darling "&#xD;
The reader has probably, ere this,&#xD;
arrived at the conclusion, that Mrs.&#xD;
Rogers'. professions of virtue and&#xD;
piety were all moonshine. To sum&#xD;
bp' her character in a few words, she&#xD;
was a very s'wewed, ntelligent, vain&#xD;

sion-the love of gold-the Spanard&#xD;
had succeeded in securing her as-&#xD;
sistance in the infernal plan which&#xD;
he had formed, with reference to Mras.&#xD;
Harold.&#xD;
But let us return to the amiable&#xD;
pair, whom we left in the act of ex-&#xD;
changing kisses. After indulging in&#xD;
a few more delicate little endear-&#xD;
ments, which put the housekeeper in&#xD;
a state of great good humor, the&#xD;
gardener said-&#xD;
" And now, my angel, tell me all&#xD;
tlrat passed between you and Mrs.&#xD;
Harold, in relation to my affair with&#xD;
her in the garden, this afternoon."&#xD;
.The angel-a very fat one, by the&#xD;
way-complied with this request,&#xD;
and related the particulars of her in-&#xD;
terview with her mistress. In con-&#xD;
cluding her narration, Mrs. Rogers&#xD;
remarked--&#xD;
"So you see that, had it not been&#xD;
for me, you would have lest your,&#xD;
place, and then all your fie plans for&#xD;
ruining the poor lady, would have-&#xD;
been knocked in the head, as 'the say-&#xD;
is. It was very stupid in you, Lopez,&#xD;
to treat her as you did this afternoon;-&#xD;
but we'll say no, more about that.--&#xD;

his eyes rested upon his master's por-&#xD;

"'This is the closet," said Mrs.&#xD;
Rogers, as she opened the door of a&#xD;
small apartment, which was occupied&#xD;
as a sort of store room for cast-off&#xD;
clothing, and the like.&#xD;
" See !" cried the housekeeper,&#xD;
pointing to a crack in the door-&#xD;
"this will enable you to view all that&#xD;
passes in the chamber. Now are you&#xD;
satisfied with these arrangements 4"&#xD;
" They are all very well," replied&#xD;
Lopez, " provided that the lady does&#xD;
not discover me. Its that case, there&#xD;
will be the devil to pay !"&#xD;

that is all. But remember, you rust&#xD;

become excited by the lady's charms.&#xD;
Do not repeat this afternoon's folly,&#xD;

said Lopez.    .&#xD;

his place of concealment in' Mrs. &#xD;
Harold's chamber cautiously issued&#xD;
the Spaniard. He approached the '#&#xD;
aed, and gazed upon the slumbering&#xD;
,ady. Then did the villain's breath&#xD;
come hot and thick; the -perspira-&#xD;
lion started from every pore; his&#xD;
heart beat audibly-for' the near&#xD;
view of those distracting charms well&#xD;
nigh maddened him. Unable to re-&#xD;
strain himself, he bent over h~r, and&#xD;
polluted her ripe, moist lips with a&#xD;
licentious kiss,&#xD;
The lady awoke with a start, and&#xD;
a slight scream; quick aslightning,&#xD;
[Lopez concealed himself behind the&#xD;
curtains of the bed.&#xD;
'Gracious heavens!" cried Mrs.&#xD;
Harold, partly arising from the coach,&#xD;
and gazing wildly around her -&#xD;
"could it have been a dream  only,&#xD;
or did I really behold a dark figure&#xD;
at the bed side? Naay, I thought&#xD;
that some hideous being imprinted&#xD;
upon my lips a kiss; and, 0 my God!&#xD;
I fancy that I can detect upon these&#xD;
lips the foul taste of tobacco juice,&#xD;
as if left there by the ravisher! This&#xD;
is dreadful; but, after all, it may be&#xD;
nothing but imagination. Yet that&#xD;
closet doorLhow came that open!&#xD;
As if animated by a desperate re-&#xD;
solve, which overcame her fear, she&#xD;
leaped from the bed, seized  e of&#xD;
the candles, and began to sea h the&#xD;
chamber. The situation    Lopez&#xD;
was a critical one; but he knew how&#xD;
to act, in this emergency. He drew&#xD;
from his pocket a huge clasp knife,&#xD;
and determined to cut her throat,&#xD;
if shediscovered him. Crouching&#xD;
down, he crawled beneath the bed,&#xD;
and covered himself with a roll of&#xD;
arpeting that had been placed there.&#xD;

there seems to be some reason for&#xD;

Again she slept; but Lopez did&#xD;
not venture to come forth from his&#xD;
hiding place, until a profound silence&#xD;
of half an hour's duration, assured&#xD;
him that he might do so with safety.&#xD;
Then again did he bend over that&#xD;
divine form, and devour its beauties&#xD;
with his licentious eyes. Then,&#xD;
holding his clasp knife in his hand,,&#xD;
ready to murder her if she' awoke,&#xD;
did the audacious villain venture to&#xD;
perpetrate new outrages; but not&#xD;
the extreme outrage which his black&#xD;
soul longed to consummate, and&#xD;

P&#xD;
&#xD;
Our hero stepped to the bed-side,&#xD;
ana gently drew the coverlid over&#xD;
the form of Mrs. Harold, who was&#xD;
still in a profound slumer; then,&#xD;
turning to the Spaniard, he said, in a&#xD;
stern whisper-&#xD;
" Leave this chamber, instantly!"&#xD;
"Come,"    said  Lopez - "yok&#xD;
mustn't interfere with my arrange-&#xD;
ments, young fellow. You'd better&#xD;
retire with your blower, at once, and&#xD;
save trouble."&#xD;
"Leave the chamber, I say, or a&#xD;
aden pill shall find its way through&#xD;
your skull! You know me too well&#xD;
to think me capable of trifling."&#xD;
And, as he uttered these words,&#xD;
Jack cocked a pistol, and levelled it&#xD;
at the Spaniard's head.&#xD;
"The devil! Take care, lieutet,-&#xD;
ant, or that pistol ipight go oil," ex-&#xD;
claimed Lopez--"is this the way ip&#xD;
which you repay me for tlh trouble I&#xD;
have taken to make a crossman Pf&#xD;
you? Remember, it is to me that&#xD;
you are indebted for your present&#xD;
position "&#xD;
"Yes," said Jack, bitterly--"you&#xD;
are right; had it not been for you,&#xD;
villain, instead of being a hunted&#xD;
criminal, at this moment .I would&#xD;
have been honest and happy. But&#xD;
I've no time to waste with you; will&#xD;
you go hepce, or die? Take your&#xD;
choice."&#xD;
"Well," said the Spaniard, dog*-&#xD;
godly--." if I must go, I must; but&#xD;
why do you insist upon it?"&#xD;
"Because your presence here is&#xD;
an .insult to that lady, whom I once&#xD;
regarded as my mother.. Not know-&#xD;
ing of Mr. Harold's departure,I&#xD;
came here to-night to rob the house,&#xD;
in revenge fpr h.s having sent me to&#xD;
the Refrge; but s that lady was&#xD;
ever kind to me, Pit protect her with&#xD;

door; upon the threshold he paused,&#xD;
and said, as he shM his clenched&#xD;

"Stay," said our hero, as the Span-&#xD;

" you are a treacherous scoundrel,&#xD;
and, unless secured, may go forth ip.&#xD;
to the streets and bring the ofcers of&#xD;
justice upon us. Lead the way to your&#xD;

Lopez was forced to comply, for he&#xD;
knew Jack's firm and desprs te ,na-&#xD;
ture, and dreaded, the pistote With&#xD;
which he and Kate were armed. The&#xD;
trio proceeded down the stairs, thro&#xD;
the hall, arid issued from the reyr of&#xD;
the house into the garden ; tlis they&#xD;
crossed, and entered the gardeper's&#xD;
house-&#xD;

Kate drew up-the slide ef the dark&#xD;

BdiIg the unfortunate Spaniard a&#xD;
sarcastic good night, and wishing him&#xD;
pleasant dreams, our hopeful pair re-&#xD;
crossed.the garden, and paused at the&#xD;
back door of the mansion.&#xD;
"Here let us hold a council 'of&#xD;
war," said Jack, seating himself upon&#xD;
the steps.  '&#xD;
"1Agreed," cried Kate, placing' her.&#xD;
self at his side-'shall we, enter the&#xD;

shall we, like gallant cracksmen, re-&#xD;

who, while.I lived beneath his roof,&#xD;
was like the kindest of mothers. to&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"You are right, my dear," said&#xD;
Kate, approvingly-" besides,it would&#xD;
seem cowardly in us to crack a crib&#xD;
during the absence of the master.-&#xD;
So now let us go home.'f&#xD;
"I must first warn Mm. Harold to&#xD;
beware of that Spaniard. Show a&#xD;
glim."&#xD;
Jack took from his pocket a scrap&#xD;
of paper and a pencil; and, by "the&#xD;
light of the dark lantern, wrote as fol-&#xD;
lows :-&#xD;
" To Mas. HAROLD. Maranet--Beware&#xD;
of Lopez, the Spanish gardener. He med$.&#xD;
states seme evil design against you; for last&#xD;

He is a villain or the blackest' ye, capable&#xD;
of any act of dishonesty,.teahery or put-&#xD;

Directing Kate to await his return,&#xD;
Jack hastened to the chamber of the&#xD;
lady, who was still asleep, and placed&#xD;
this note upon her dressingstable.-&#xD;
He then rejoined his companion, and&#xD;
the pair, having quitted the premises&#xD;
by the way they came, proceeded to-&#xD;
wards the abode of the Giantess, in&#xD;
