T HE MOUNTAIN OUTJLAWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
TUE SILENT TRAGEDY.&#xD;
It was quite dark when the hunter reached&#xD;
the spot where he had set his traps the day&#xD;
before. It was one of those singular places'&#xD;
that are found in the mountain-ranges only,&#xD;
shut out from the usual haunts of men by im-&#xD;
passable barriers, and towering ramparts of&#xD;
earth and rock. But to the Northern trapper,&#xD;
all places are accessible. His practiced' eyes&#xD;
find the thread-like passes, and his experienced&#xD;
hand unlocks the secret gates ohe mountains.&#xD;
His feet are familiar with hidden paths ; and&#xD;
the moss upon the tret s, as well as the-stars in&#xD;
the sky, direct his seeps.'&#xD;
The hunter reached the inter-mountain soli-&#xD;
tude, to which we have referred, by a cul-de-&#xD;
sac, which he had believed was known only to&#xD;
himself ; but, having recently lost several&#xD;
traps, which he had set upon a deep, narrow&#xD;
stream that watered the basin, and found its&#xD;
way out to a more open country, by some in-&#xD;
explicable winding way, his opinion in regard&#xD;
to the immunity of the spot from other human&#xD;
visitors lhad changed. He was not disposed&#xD;
to bear his losses without an effort to solve the&#xD;
mystery. He approached the margin of the&#xD;
dark stream not without a feeling of curiosity,&#xD;
which was soon changed to surprise, by the&#xD;
discovery that his traps were again missing.&#xD;
Having well assured himself of this fact, he&#xD;
searched, as thoroughly as the darkness would&#xD;
permit, for some clue to the authors of this&#xD;
mischief, bu was unable to obtain the faintest'&#xD;
evidence that the spot had been visited by a&#xD;
white or red man.               _&#xD;
The trapper mused awhile, and then con-&#xD;
cealed himself in the rank grass and weeds&#xD;
near the water, which, at that point, seemed to&#xD;
flow out of the mountains, from beneath an&#xD;
&#xD;
arching roof of solid rock. The hunter,&#xD;
stretched at his length upon the soft verdure,&#xD;
listened to the murmur of the stream a long&#xD;
time, undisturbed, wondering where it came&#xD;
from, and hdw it forced its way through the&#xD;
flinty fastnesses of the ranges. The night grew&#xD;
darker. The blackness seemed to be rolled&#xD;
and compressed into the basin, till it resem.&#xD;
bled that Egyptian darkness that could be&#xD;
felt.&#xD;
Presently a light flashed across the ravine.&#xD;
Startled at. the phenomenon, the trapper&#xD;
looked vainly for its cause, and had made up&#xD;
his mind that it was a flash of lightning ; when,&#xD;
upon the summit of a cliff, directly opposite,&#xD;
he discovered the solution of the mystery.&#xD;
Two persons stood there, holding brilliant&#xD;
torches over their heads, and endeavoring, by&#xD;
their light, to obtain a view of the stream be.&#xD;
low._ These men were clad something like&#xD;
Mexican banditti.. They wore the deer-skin&#xD;
hunting-shirts of the northwestern tr tie.&#xD;
with plain leggings and mocca ins. Th, ,ger&#xD;
of the two wore a red sash around his  ist&#xD;
with flowing,jaunty ends  Beneath this were4&#xD;
thrust a brace of cavalry pistols, dagger .i&#xD;
a handsome sheath, a hinting-knife with-A siP&#xD;
ver handle, and an ivory call of large size.&#xD;
He carried in his hand a double-barrel carbine.&#xD;
He was of medium height, thick-set, and the&#xD;
corporate members compactly knitted to-&#xD;
gether. His head was covered by a skin cap.&#xD;
His features, as they appeared to the trapper&#xD;
by the light of the torch,.were strongly marked,&#xD;
coarse, and hard.&#xD;
His companion was of lighter mace, but&#xD;
dressed much in the same style, with the ex-&#xD;
ception that he wore a black leathern belt in&#xD;
stead of sash.&#xD;
The two remained there but a few moments,&#xD;
and disappeared as mysteriously as they ease.&#xD;
This cireumstance perplexedlthe trapper. It&#xD;

&#xD;
PATITAWAY; OR, THE MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
a peared to hin that something out of the or-&#xD;
dinary course of events was about to happen.&#xD;
The faces he had seen troubled him. He beat&#xD;
a tattoo upon his forehead with his fingers,&#xD;
formed numberless conjectures, and grew more&#xD;
confident that the last was the furthest from&#xD;
the truth-a significant hint that those which&#xD;
might follow would be still less satisfactory.&#xD;
WIdle he ias thus cogitating, the torches ap-&#xD;
pearl$ i s another direction, slowly descending&#xD;
a steep and difficult pass on the same side,&#xD;
but lower down the stream. Their progress&#xD;
was manifestly difficult and dangerous. For&#xD;
some ten minutes he  watched the light moving-&#xD;
eccentrically to and fro, sometimes totally dis-&#xD;
appearing, then flashing out clearer and nearer.&#xD;
Anon, they were near enough for the trapper&#xD;
to see that they were followed by four others,&#xD;
bearing a burden which looked like a human&#xD;
figure wrapped in a cloak. He instinctively&#xD;
drew himself further beneath the rocky arch&#xD;
that spanned the stream, The strange noc-&#xD;
turnal visitors reached the bottom of the ra-&#xD;
vine, an4l the man with the sash led the way&#xD;
to the margin of the water, when the four&#xD;
men, in obedience to a slight gesture from him,&#xD;
pled their burden upon the ground, and fell&#xD;
bask into a group by themselves.&#xD;
41he trapper began to leel an indefinable in-&#xD;
r -t st in the motionless object they had thus&#xD;
dpesited. What was it? A human being?&#xD;
,"dead or living? These questions were&#xD;
imtnedijtely answered. A young and feminine&#xD;
re',prang up, casting aside the closk, that&#xD;
had enveloped her. The glare of the torches&#xD;
lighted up the rocky basin. and gave the hun-&#xD;
ter a full view ,of her person. Her face was&#xD;
pale as winter snow, and lovely beyond expres-&#xD;
sion. The forester had .never seen beauty of&#xD;
so:iigh an'order. It seemed to his rough and&#xD;
honest nature, that an'angelic creature had&#xD;
* suddenly descended from the sky to thrill and&#xD;
awe him, for a moment, with her supernal&#xD;
eia. Her hats, long, dark, and shining,&#xD;
l   ye wavy threads of jet inthe torchlight, hung&#xD;
iveled overter gracefulneek and rounded&#xD;
shoulders. The symmetry of her person was&#xD;
4    ns'vloua. She gazed about her wildly, then&#xD;
a Jierselfuspon her knees at the feet of the&#xD;
si the sash. She threw up her arms, so&#xD;
e and beautiful; they waved to and fro--&#xD;
,,  t*eat the air in an agony of supplication,&#xD;
rapper heard her cry : "Save me-save&#xD;
* The words struck him like the thrusts of a&#xD;
'dagger. He was tempted to rush forth and&#xD;
die in defence of sueh .transcendent .bpauty.&#xD;
But they were six, he but one; he would wait.&#xD;
Vrovidence would, perhaps, give him the priv-&#xD;
i Ege of doing something for that helpless and&#xD;
despiring woihan. He had heard some one&#xD;
or he had read it, that Heaven's time was&#xD;
,tv#  i*hoir of man'shopelessness. The trapper&#xD;
to bea .;religionist-after the&#xD;
iane    fashionable Christiani-&#xD;
&#xD;
ty, but he had the true instincts of the child&#xD;
of Nature, who, all unknown to the world,&#xD;
spontaneously worships in spirit and in truth.&#xD;
Honest men do not entirely forget.God in the&#xD;
wilderness, for he has placed so many memen-&#xD;
toes of His presence around them that it is im-&#xD;
possible to forget them.&#xD;
The trapper's sympathies were terribly&#xD;
awoke. The fair supplant took a chain from&#xD;
her neck, drew the rings from her fingers, and&#xD;
threw them at the man's feet. He gathered&#xD;
them up in silence, and dropped them into the&#xD;
pouch at his side. She continued her entreat-&#xD;
ies; she attempted 'to take his hand, but he&#xD;
pushed her from him. Tired, apparently, of&#xD;
this scene, he looked significantly at the four&#xD;
ruffians in the background. They came for-&#xD;
ward, and laid their rough hands upon her.&#xD;
The trapper deemed such touch sacrilege, and&#xD;
it required all his self-discipline to prevent hini&#xD;
from sending a bullet through the head of the&#xD;
author of this.outrage. She ceased to strug-&#xD;
gle, and, abandoning all earthly hope, appeared&#xD;
to be addressing her prayers to Heaven. They&#xD;
bound her white arms behind her; the rigor&#xD;
of the cords wounded her delicate wrists till&#xD;
they were stained with little drops of blood.&#xD;
She' was then muffled in the large cloak, in&#xD;
which was placed.a stone of considerable size,&#xD;
and both made fast to her person.&#xD;
The beautiful victim of these persecutions&#xD;
had alrea   wooned, and was insensible to all&#xD;
these prep nations. She was as motionless .as&#xD;
a corpse, and as passive. The four mute men&#xD;
lifted the unresisting form, while the other&#xD;
two held their torches over the stream. While&#xD;
this was taking place, the trapper threw off his&#xD;
hunting-shirt, and divested himself of his arms&#xD;
except his hunting-knife. His heart was beat-&#xD;
ing madly ; the blood went racing tumultuous-&#xD;
ly through his veins, while his swarthy brow&#xD;
was streaming with perspiration. He resolved&#xD;
to hazard all for the woman. Of her history,&#xD;
of the events that led to this tragedy, he knew&#xD;
nothing ; but in his soul he believed her inno-&#xD;
cent of all crime, and undeserving the fate to&#xD;
which she was too manifestly domed. Her&#xD;
sex, her helplessness, her wondrous 'beauty,&#xD;
appealed to him, and touched his heart as it&#xD;
had never been touched before.&#xD;
The men carried her to the very margin of&#xD;
the stream, swung the motionless body to and&#xD;
fro for a moment, and east it from them ; it,&#xD;
fell into the dark water-it sank-it disap-'&#xD;
peared from view. Afew bubbles marked the&#xD;
spot where it went dwu. The man with. the&#xD;
sash gazed a few seconds at the disturbed sur-&#xD;
face, then, waving his torch, turned from the&#xD;
place, and, followed by his accomplices, as-&#xD;
eended, hurriedly, the rocks.- All this was,&#xD;
performed in silence; not a -word had been&#xD;
uttered by the grim leader or his men. It&#xD;
passed before the eyes of the trapper like a&#xD;
horrible dream;: but,,shaking off the chilling&#xD;
impression it had produced, he lowered him- 5&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
PATHAWAY; OR, THE&#xD;
self quietly and quickly into the stream, with&#xD;
his hunting-knife between his teeth, and diving,&#xD;
sawm to the spot where the muffled form had&#xD;
gone down.&#xD;
He soon reached it, and with his knife dis-&#xD;
engaged the woman from the stone ; then,&#xD;
grasping her with his left hand, struck out&#xD;
bravely with his right, still keeping beneath&#xD;
the surface. He was a hardy swimmer, but&#xD;
by this time he began to experience a terrible&#xD;
pressure about the chest. The waters hissed&#xD;
and roared in his ears, and the demand for air&#xD;
was imperative and painful. He arose near&#xD;
the bank with his unconscious burden. He&#xD;
gasped, he breathed, he was strong again.' He&#xD;
sprang from the water and drew her after him.&#xD;
He had scarcely done this, when he heard&#xD;
quick footsteps on'the rocks, and* saw the&#xD;
gleam of a torch again. He threw himself&#xD;
down in the grass beside the immobile object&#xD;
of his solicitude. The assassin was returning&#xD;
to take a parting look at the'stream, to see if&#xD;
his unhallowed work had been effectually per-&#xD;
formed. He lingered but a short time, and&#xD;
turned on his heel, the trapper thought, with&#xD;
an involuntary shudder. He was out of sight&#xD;
in a moment.&#xD;
The hunter tore the cloak from the woman,&#xD;
and bore her to a; drier and more sheltered&#xD;
spot. He chafed her temple, he rubbed her&#xD;
hands, and employed various other arts to&#xD;
bring her to consciousness. At first, a slight&#xD;
tremor of the body,-then a sigh, assured him&#xD;
that his efforts were not in vain. A thrill of&#xD;
blushing life soon animated her peerless pro-&#xD;
portions. The beautiful eyes -opened, the pale&#xD;
lips moved, and a gleam of intelligence illum-&#xD;
inated the face. Evidently that portion of&#xD;
time that had elapsed since she had been&#xD;
thrown into the water and taken from it, was&#xD;
entirely lost to her apprehension. The hor-&#xD;
ror inspired by the miscreants was still upon&#xD;
her and paramount. Again she stretched out&#xD;
those white arms for mercy, and uplifted&#xD;
those soft andpleading eyes. The movement&#xD;
deeply affected the trapper.&#xD;
" You're safe, little woman-you're safe 4"&#xD;
he exclaimed, earnestly. "The wretches have.&#xD;
gone, and you're with a ,man who is ready to&#xD;
diefor'you! No more need of askin' for mer-&#xD;
cy, gal; no more claspin' of them white&#xD;
hands in despair, no more turnin' of that pale&#xD;
face to heaven!"&#xD;
The girl looked vaguely and incredulously&#xD;
*          at the hunter ; her mind was disordered ; and.&#xD;
she could not quite comprehend what had&#xD;
transpired, and her situation. The one idea&#xD;
of deadly peril still absorbed and bewildered&#xD;
her.&#xD;
" Look at dne, gal ! Recollect yourself.&#xD;
There's a friend near ye, who'll never desart&#xD;
you in the hour o'-diffikilty. See ! the mon-&#xD;
sters are not here ! You have escaped their&#xD;
cruelty-you are free and safe! Heaven be&#xD;
*           praised, who would not allow ouch a deed of&#xD;
&#xD;
MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS.                       5&#xD;
darkness! I've alleys believed in Providence,&#xD;
and I believe it more nor ever to-night!"&#xD;
The soothing tones and enest- words of&#xD;
the trapper acted like magic upon the girL.&#xD;
She began to understand ; she saw a kindly&#xD;
sympathizing face bending over her, and the&#xD;
man, raising her tenderly, she pillowed her&#xD;
face upon his shoulder and wept.lAe a; child.&#xD;
Thetrapper laid his large hand pretecting-&#xD;
ly upon her pretty head, and passed 4hs fin-&#xD;
gers carelessly through her wet tresss, There&#xD;
was magnetism-there was enchantment in the&#xD;
movement; the girl was reassured--she felt,&#xD;
sheknew, that she was indeed safe, andseizing&#xD;
the sun-browned hand, kissed it and dropped&#xD;
tears upon it.&#xD;
CHAPTER UI.&#xD;
THE CAPTIVE TRAPPEB.&#xD;
It was the vernal season in the mountains.&#xD;
The trees were in foliage ; the stretching prai.&#xD;
ries were carpeted with green; and-the winter&#xD;
snows had melted from   the peaks of the&#xD;
ranges.&#xD;
The trapper stood on a shelving rock, look.&#xD;
ing down into a deep valley below. In height,&#xD;
he was over six feet---rather slim---straight as&#xD;
an arrow-his muscles hard and seasoned with&#xD;
exercise., He wore the garb of the Northern&#xD;
adventurer and hunter. His face was pleasant&#xD;
and genial, though it had a few legible care.&#xD;
lines- upon it. Nature had gifted him, with&#xD;
one of those comical mouths which it is im-&#xD;
possible to reduce to melancholy, but which&#xD;
will persist, in the most trying emergencies, in&#xD;
looking hopeful and brave.   His. deep-set&#xD;
eyes harmonized wonderfully with his mouth,&#xD;
having the same cheerful prestige. His -&#xD;
rested easily and gracefully across his left-s&#xD;
His tall and motionless figure, atandin  ;'r-&#xD;
lief against the rocks, would have 'fktie&#xD;
pleasmg picture for the painter, whose as'diti&#xD;
eye, overlooking common-places, seek  the-&#xD;
picturesque and the bold as subject.  in&#xD;
spiration.&#xD;
The man--whoever he was, or whate   is&#xD;
history-had evidently met Life's voiitdge.&#xD;
with a manly front, and learned :to-dure,&#xD;
with a philosophical patience, misfortune'that&#xD;
could not be averted. He was a nomad; his&#xD;
- wandering nature was palpably written-upon&#xD;
him. He carriedwith him, in son e inexpli-&#xD;
cable way, the air of one who  annot remain&#xD;
at rest. Give him mountains;',prairies, for-&#xD;
ests, and rivers, and keeg hii from cities and&#xD;
the haunts of civilized n.en,and he is at home,&#xD;
thouzhy his mighty campingground    rean&#xD;
hundred .jles apart.&#xD;
A dildtoand crept up the ascent to 'he&#xD;

&#xD;
eameaetive., He descended the jagged side of&#xD;
the mountain, until he could command a wider&#xD;
view of the valley; then, posting himself be.&#xD;
hind a tree, watched for the ""use o the noise&#xD;
he had heard, which was soon apparent. Five&#xD;
horsemen appeared, and approached the spot&#xD;
where he was concealed. Your of the parties&#xD;
were natives of the country ; but the fifth was&#xD;
a whiteman, and a captive. As they came&#xD;
near, and drew opposite the trapper's point of&#xD;
observation, he was able to arrive at several&#xD;
conclusions in regard to the prisoner. He&#xD;
was a man considerably matured in life, and&#xD;
belonged!'obviously, to that rough and roving&#xD;
cles known as free trappers, who 'fraternize&#xD;
alike with the white and red races. It was&#xD;
plain that he had not been taken without a&#xD;
struggle - marks -of which were palpable&#xD;
enough upon his torn and soiled hunting-&#xD;
shirt, not to mention a wound upon his face.&#xD;
He was minus the skin cap usually worn by&#xD;
people of his type-having lost it, doubtless,&#xD;
in the conflict that attended his capture. His&#xD;
long, unkempt hair hung in matted masses&#xD;
over his face, giving it a dogged and morose&#xD;
expression-heightened, questionless, by the&#xD;
state of mind he was in. His hands were&#xD;
lashed at his back, with a rigor that gave him&#xD;
a foretaste of the tortures in reserve for him&#xD;
when his captors should reach their camp or&#xD;
village. He was secured to his horse, to make&#xD;
assurance doubly sure, by stout thongs of buf-&#xD;
falo skin tied to his ankles, and passing under&#xD;
his horse's flanks.&#xD;
It was easy to'perceive that this wanderer&#xD;
of the wilderness was ill pleased with this ar-&#xD;
rangement; and the sullen manner in which&#xD;
be bore his reverses, indicated that patience&#xD;
was not among his prominent virtues., Two&#xD;
of his triumphant conquerors rode before, two&#xD;
behind him. The most important personage&#xD;
ofthe party kept a little in advance, and was&#xD;
elearly:a warrior of distinction. His "face and&#xD;
naked limbs were painted to the highest-point&#xD;
of lIdian fashion.  His- neck, chest and&#xD;
cheeks were bedeviled finely with alternate&#xD;
streaks of black, red, and white. His head&#xD;
was decorated with seven eagle feathers which&#xD;
told t he was of very high caste, indeed-'&#xD;
paei"Cherrepresenting a scalp that he had&#xD;
t *em0  in this particular, he enjoyed an envi-&#xD;
ableatm 'eriority over his three companions-&#xD;
nosWhomn could sport more than four of&#xD;
these tell* ale badges, while one; of them dis-&#xD;
played but two.&#xD;
It wWnear sunset. The declining rays of&#xD;
the golden orb fell brightly upon captors and&#xD;
captiveapast the spot where the&#xD;
.  4 i~berty,"imittered the latter, "is a mighty&#xD;
'''thing, 'secially when the sun eh res,&#xD;
and  ati' looks pleasant. Now that poor&#xD;
itterhas lost hf'ni, and got into ,diffik lty.&#xD;
Them, p'isohA ar-aerits lYltake him to their vil-&#xD;
1agand:bnse him, asi if he's a condemned&#xD;
&#xD;
Hottentot, or a heathen like theirselves. -,The&#xD;
feller isn't 'tractive to look at, and has rather&#xD;
a hang-dog expression, I allow ; but I don't&#xD;
like the idee of his ben' rubbed out afore his.&#xD;
time comes."&#xD;
A light footfall caused the trapper to change&#xD;
his position : a boy of thirteen or fourteen had&#xD;
approached him unheard, and was now near&#xD;
him. He was a youth to fix the attention of&#xD;
the observer immediately, and retain it. In&#xD;
stature he was small, with a personal develop-&#xD;
ment singularly delicate and graceful. Ibis&#xD;
complexion was dark -his eyes large and&#xD;
dreamy-his feature wondrously regular and&#xD;
fair. It was evident that ie was of mixed&#xD;
blood; but the somewhat dusky hue of his&#xD;
cheeks did not seem to impair his beauty.&#xD;
His hair was long, black, and curling. He&#xD;
wore a light, jaunty cap, which partially con-&#xD;
cealed his forehead.  His neck was small,-&#xD;
round, and delicately set upon' the shoulders,&#xD;
which were feminine in their contour. His&#xD;
frock, which was of the finest and softest&#xD;
dressed doeskin, -was ornamented with fringes&#xD;
of Indian needle-work. The sleeve, where it&#xD;
fell over the wrist, was wrought with bright&#xD;
colors in quills; while the hand below it ap-&#xD;
peared, by its smallness and delicacy, to he&#xD;
unacquainted with toil: those members had&#xD;
never been hardened with labor. His leggings&#xD;
and moccasins were of the same material as&#xD;
his frock, and of the same elaborate make.&#xD;
To look at, he was indeed a handsome youth.&#xD;
The only fault that could be found with him&#xD;
was, that he was too effeminate to fill one's&#xD;
idea of developing nianliness ; yet this defect&#xD;
did not inspire a feeling of contempt, but&#xD;
rather of admiration; for there was a spirit in&#xD;
the boy's eyes, and an expression about his&#xD;
mouth, that checked the rising impulse of&#xD;
scorn or pity. .Iis figure was erect-his step&#xD;
elastic. There was a smile ;on his lips when&#xD;
the trapper turned toward him.&#xD;
" Ali it is you, Sebastian V"&#xD;
" It is I, Niohoas. I saw you creep down,&#xD;
the mountain, and observe something in the&#xD;
valley, Mountaineer, you have been mutter-&#xD;
ing to yourself,",replied the youth, in a clear,&#xD;
sweet voice.   -&#xD;
" You have sharp eyes, lad. There's little&#xD;
to be seen-that you don't see. You'd better&#xD;
heed my. advice, and stick close to camp," an-&#xD;
swered the trapper.&#xD;
" It's lonely at camp; besides, I don't like&#xD;
to lose sight of you, uncle Nicholas," returned&#xD;
the boy Sebastian.&#xD;
" Lonely at the camp ! Lonely with Mis-&#xD;
fortin andSmuggler-a brace of brutes that&#xD;
are as fond of ye as they be of fresh buffaler-&#xD;
hump. Bless your soul, ladi what better coin-&#xD;
panv do you want? Then it's so pleasant to,&#xD;
set at the camp-door and see Shagbark crop&#xD;
the tender grass, or give his heels an airiu,&#xD;
when his sperrits are up."&#xD;
We must. remark -here, enpassant, that&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
M&#xD;
&#xD;
No&#xD;
&#xD;
S&#xD;
&#xD;
"Misfortin " and " Smuggler " were two hon&#xD;
est dogs-the steadfast friends and companion&#xD;
of the trapper-while " Shagbark " was the&#xD;
name of a favorite horse-an animal tried in&#xD;
thousand tramps across the prairies.&#xD;
" They are, no doubt, faithful creatures, bu&#xD;
not quite equal to the mountaineer Nicholas&#xD;
to whom I owe such a debt of gratitude-"&#xD;
"None o' that, little un. I'll make a con&#xD;
demned diffikilty atween us one o' these days&#xD;
if you don't stop pratin' about gratitude ' an&#xD;
sich like. Do you -s'pose a rough feller lik&#xD;
me ever did more nor his duty? Did yot&#xD;
ever see an individooal that ever did more not&#xD;
his duty? Did I ever? Did anybody ever?'&#xD;
The trapper glanced skyward, sighed, an&#xD;
capped the climax by adding:&#xD;
"0 Heaven ! no!"&#xD;
"Bless your honest old soul! '"exclaimed&#xD;
the boy, taking one of the trapper's larg(&#xD;
brown hands in his.&#xD;
"Humbug !-for you are a humbug, and]&#xD;
shall call you so as long's you're with me.-&#xD;
don't take it kind of'ye to.call me old. Do]&#xD;
look as if there was an ' old soul' in thisbodyl&#xD;
The Lord love you, nod If 'twas a thousand&#xD;
year old, there'd never be a wrinkle in it; foi&#xD;
the Master of life, in givin' me a small intel&#xD;
lect, balanced the account by a hopeful hear&#xD;
and cheerful disposition. I never see no-trou-&#xD;
ble ahead, and don't borrer none to make my.&#xD;
self miser'ble with ; though some of my family&#xD;
did nothin' but borrer trouble, and died'thout&#xD;
payin' it. But see ! the dogs have missed ye ;&#xD;
Smuggler's settin' on the brow of the plateau,&#xD;
with his nose in the air, while Misfortin is&#xD;
slowly ereepin' down the slope. Go back,&#xD;
Humbug, and I'll jine ye presently."&#xD;
" But you have not told me what you saw."&#xD;
"Four redskins, with a captive white man&#xD;
-a free trapper, I should say. He was nigh&#xD;
about as dirty as an Ingin himself ; but he'll&#xD;
be purified, as 'twere, by fire, afore long, I al-&#xD;
low," replied Nicholas, thoughtfully. " But&#xD;
go you up with the dogs, and I'll toiler ye ar-&#xD;
ter I've looked at my traps."&#xD;
-"Trapa! You are not going to look at&#xD;
traps, Uncle Nicholas ; you're going to follow&#xD;
that party of Indians-I see it in your eyes.&#xD;
You pity the prisoner. But if you should be&#xD;
killed--if you should be killed, Nicholas--a&#xD;
sad day it would be to Sebastian Delaunayl!&#xD;
What a terrible thing it would be to be;left in&#xD;
the measureless wilderness without a friend!"&#xD;
" My dear lad,you forgit the dogs," said the&#xD;
trapper, with a half smile, looking down be-&#xD;
nignantly upon the youth. "%I'l .glad, for&#xD;
the sake o' their feeling's, that they didn't hear&#xD;
ye make that remark. Why, Smuggler would&#xD;
eat his own tail with vexation ; and Misfortia&#xD;
would be more onreconciled than ever to bein'&#xD;
t dog. 'Go up,'I say, lad ; don't be: obstinate.&#xD;
Vou want to make me cross-grained and ill*&#xD;
tempered, don't yae?"&#xD;
"You nrc' brave, Nicholas, and it touches&#xD;

,t   "What for ? To hinder my movements; to&#xD;

, I say, No ! The man who follera a trail must&#xD;

u "I will obey you. But promise me,",added&#xD;
r the youth, with more earnestness,," that -you&#xD;
" will be very careful, and not deprive me of my&#xD;
I only protector."&#xD;
"I promise ! Rashness and imnprudeses&#xD;
would be injustice to you. I won't run no&#xD;
I risks if I cen help it. 'll be wise as a sarpent,&#xD;
e and dangerous as I can. Call up the dogs,&#xD;
and don't let 'em foller me."&#xD;
I    The youth turned reluctantly; away; an45&#xD;
I calling the dogs, with affected eheerfulness&#xD;
I slowly ascended toward the plateau; while&#xD;
Nicholas, after lookingat him a few sco'ds,&#xD;
I rapidly descended to the valley.&#xD;
r The sunwas sinking to the verge of the&#xD;
horizon, and twilight mists were already, purl-&#xD;
t ing in upon mountain-p sand defile. Having&#xD;
reached the fresh trai ,he-made a momentary&#xD;
halt, examined his rifle and equipments, tight-&#xD;
ened his belt, and resumed his way like a nan,&#xD;
who has made up his mind. That heae aoe&#xD;
quainted with that region, was obvious fromn&#xD;
the manner in which he noted the landmarks.&#xD;
"'I know\nigh -about where'll, they'll, go," i&#xD;
said, speaking to himself. "Bein' mounted,&#xD;
th 'll be obleeged-to foller the windin'sof the&#xD;
val y; but I'l make shorter wort os't."&#xD;
r   The mountaineer no longer threaded the in.&#xD;
tricacies of the valley, but made a straight&#xD;
course across mountain-spur, meadow, andra-&#xD;
vine. For two hours he held his way ove A&#xD;
country rough and rugged, and inaccessible&#xD;
to inexperiencedfeet. Considerably exhausted,&#xD;
he reached the goal of his-wishes, ._It was&#xD;
spot lying between twomountains, waters -by&#xD;
a small tributary of the southern:bransk 4,&#xD;
the Sasketehewan. On the eastern side' w sa&#xD;

leading to the Sasketchewan prairies, amthe&#xD;
favorite hunting-grounds of the Blaekfeet.,&#xD;
Two horsemen could not.ride abreast th&#xD;
this gate in the mountains. Through  *a itene&#xD;
tsr-mountain pocket, the trapper licholas&#xD;
calculated that the braves would bebiged to&#xD;

villages of their people. Its wgs here, nesr the&#xD;

pearance excited. The Northern trapper is&#xD;
taught to be quick in his instincts by the dan-&#xD;
gers that continually surround him. Nicholas&#xD;
cut the thongs that bound him to the horse-&#xD;
then his knife passed quickly between his&#xD;
wrists: he was free ! His deliverer silently&#xD;
placed a brace of pistols in his hands. All&#xD;
this took place with a rapidity and adroitness&#xD;
that the clumsy inhabitants of cities cannot&#xD;
well conceive of. With a-novice, such a feat&#xD;
would have loomed up a stern impossibility ;&#xD;
but training and-skill smoothed down the rug.&#xD;
ged surfaces of seeming impracticabilities.&#xD;
Nicholas glided behind the boulder, and the&#xD;
eaptive trapper,,slipping noiselessly from his&#xD;
horse, followed him. Instantly the war-cry of&#xD;
the Blackfeet rang through the dingle.&#xD;
" Now, stranger, for a scramble among the&#xD;
rocks! Keep close to me, and I'll warrant&#xD;
we'll give the-red heathen the slip. Fire when&#xD;
you have a chance, but don't waste your lead."&#xD;
Nicholas sprang up the rocks like a moun-&#xD;
tain-goat.&#xD;
"My lhbs are summat cramped, but you&#xD;
needn't be afeard but I can use 'em to good&#xD;
advantage," replied the other, hurriedly.&#xD;
The Blackfeet were now pursuing them,&#xD;
whooping and yelling with disappointment ;&#xD;
but the fugitives had the advantage of the first&#xD;
start, and, being used to the vicissitudes and&#xD;
peils of the mountains, felt litt e apprehension&#xD;
or the result. Several shots were fired after&#xD;
them.; but they fell short, and spent their&#xD;
force on. the rocks and bushes. In ten min-&#xD;
utes, they had gained the top of the ascent ;&#xD;
and, after breathing a moment, Nicholas led&#xD;
the way along the more accessible part of the&#xD;
country.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
&#xD;
T aE MIMIC     CITY.&#xD;
Nicholas was curious to see the face of his&#xD;
companion, but the darkness prevented him&#xD;
from scanning his features; and it was not till&#xD;
the moon came up, eni hour la:er, that he was&#xD;
able to satisfy himself in this respect. A clo-&#xD;
ser view confirmed his previous impressions :&#xD;
he was of the wandering, free-trapper type,&#xD;
tinctured with Indian manners--addicted to&#xD;
most -of the habits of that race, doubtless-&#xD;
with free-and-easy notions of life, and a hearty&#xD;
contempt for those outside of his calling. 'Tlhe&#xD;
countenance that he presented to Nicholas,&#xD;
lighted by the first rays of the aseenling&#xD;
moon, was by no means calculated to invite&#xD;
friendship and secure confidence. The brow&#xD;
was low, and contracted into a perpetual&#xD;
frown. , His eves were sunken, heavy, and&#xD;
dull in expression ; while the nose was broad&#xD;
and fiat, and the mouth beneath wide, with a&#xD;
&#xD;
PATHAWAY; OR,.THE&#xD;
carnivorous air about it. The chin was short&#xD;
--the neck large--the shoulders broad. His&#xD;
garments were of the poorer sort, well worn,&#xD;
tattered, and greasy. His hair has already&#xD;
been mentioned as being in a rank state of na-&#xD;
ture-long, and matted over his forehead. In&#xD;
addition to this, the trapper was squint-eyed.&#xD;
Nicholas internally concluded that his last&#xD;
adventure had not made an important acqui-&#xD;
sition to the number of his friends ; in short,&#xD;
he was not inclined to be pleased with him.&#xD;
His manner of talking was abrupt, short, and&#xD;
jerking-giving one the impression that his&#xD;
words and sentences were discharged from a&#xD;
catapult or battery. He had a peculiar way,&#xD;
too, of grunting between his sentences, that&#xD;
was not charming.&#xD;
The hurry of the flight and the darkness&#xD;
had caused Nicholas to deviate from his intend-&#xD;
ed course. He now found himself on a con-&#xD;
siderable eminence, surrounded by scenery&#xD;
that was really wild and picturesque. Cast-&#xD;
ing his eyes eastward, he beheld what appear.&#xD;
ed to be the ruins. of a great city. This ap-&#xD;
.earance was produced by far-stretching and&#xD;
high-piled masses of rocks, that shaped them-&#xD;
selves into dark walls, tottering towers, and&#xD;
broken columns. This mimic city covered&#xD;
the sides and summit of a mountain, and at&#xD;
last, with its grand and gigantic scenery, was&#xD;
lost to view in a deep and dark valley.&#xD;
In all his wanderings, the trapper had never&#xD;
beheld a sight more worthy of attention.' He&#xD;
was contemplating it with a rapt sort of won-&#xD;
der, when he was addressed by his companion:&#xD;
"Terbaccer, eh ? Chaw, stranger ?"&#xD;
Nicolas turned, and met the heavy eyes of&#xD;
the questioner.&#xD;
"You want some o' the weed. I allow, and&#xD;
I'm most alleys able to''commodate in that&#xD;
line, though I'm not powerful fond on't my-&#xD;
self. Mister, I should say you'd been in a con-&#xD;
demned little difikilty " answered Nicholas.&#xD;
' Diffikilty, eh ?  Tisn't the first time,&#xD;
stranger ; reckon 'twon't be the.last. "Spect&#xD;
sich accidents in the wilderness. Git used to&#xD;
everything, you know, arter a while."&#xD;
The free trapper, stopped, and filled his&#xD;
mouth from the pouch which Nicholas tendered&#xD;
him, then rolling the narcotic mass into his&#xD;
right cheek with his tongue, added :&#xD;
" I obsarved you war lookin' at that heap&#xD;
o' rocks. We call it the haunted city."&#xD;
'We ? Who ?" asked Nicholas.&#xD;
The man hesitated, then stammered:&#xD;
"Why, we free trappers, to be sure !"&#xD;
1I wasn't aware," replied Nicholas, "that&#xD;
folks went trapping ' 'mong the rocks. I gin-&#xD;
er'l set my traps in the valleys, on streams,&#xD;
an lakes.&#xD;
" In coorse ; but one can't help seen' a&#xD;
mountain o' rocks like that, if he's anywhere&#xD;
in the neighborhood on't. But I'll tell you&#xD;
that it isn't a place of good repute. People&#xD;
o' my crat usually give it a wide berth.&#xD;
&#xD;
MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS.                        9&#xD;
Lonely trappers and hunters have suddenly&#xD;
disappeared in the vicinity of Haunted City."&#xD;
Nicholas shook his head incredulously, and&#xD;
the trapper went on :&#xD;
" Noises have been heerd there like dis-&#xD;
charges of artillery. The Ingins say that the&#xD;
Thunder Spirit lives there. Have heerd mys-&#xD;
terious rumblin's there myself.  There's a&#xD;
deep valley away yonder, called Lost-Trapper&#xD;
Valley. We call it Trapper Valley for short."&#xD;
"Who named these places?"asked Nicholas,&#xD;
looking sharply at his companion.&#xD;
" Every place must have a name, you&#xD;
know," he replied, somewhat perplexed again.&#xD;
" One place is named from one sarcumstanee,&#xD;
another from another.  I happen to know&#xD;
about 'em, 'cause I've cam ped a good many&#xD;
times at Otter Creek-which, I reckon, cant&#xD;
be more nor five or six miles from here. By&#xD;
the way, stranger, I allow you -oughter have a&#xD;
name yourself?"&#xD;
The trapper looked at Nicholas inquiringly.&#xD;
" You're right, mister," returned the latter,&#xD;
" I have plenty o' names, and I don't know as&#xD;
I'm  ashamed of any of 'em.   The. Ingins,&#xD;
'cording to their heathenish notions, call nye&#xD;
Doubledark, having somehow or other got the&#xD;
idee that I'm shy and crafty, which is a mis-&#xD;
take o' theirs. The fact is, I'm neither dark&#xD;
nor deep, but transperient, as 'twere, and easy&#xD;
to see through. As for bean' double-faced or&#xD;
double-natured, I ain't.  I don't earry two&#xD;
faces--I never did--I can't. Oh, no !"&#xD;
Nicholas took a long breath, and let it out&#xD;
slowly, with the air of a man who feels that&#xD;
injustice has been done him.&#xD;
" Doubledark I" repeated the other, with ia&#xD;
mocking laugh. " Youdon't look'like it, eh ?&#xD;
But what's your white name? I don't care&#xD;
much about red titles."&#xD;
" There's a name that I used to be called&#xD;
by, but sence it's got down into the settle-&#xD;
ment, and been talked over a good 'eal "ti&#xD;
folks that I don't know nothin' about, I ait&#xD;
forrard 'bout mentionin' it to strangers. Tin&#xD;
truth is, that I've bean writ-up in the -peiis&#xD;
by idle people that hadn't nothing' better to do&#xD;
--and I don't jest like it. I'll make a piso&#xD;
diffikilty 'mong 'em, if I ever git down as "fur&#xD;
as the clearin's. I never 'speeted that thin s&#xD;
would come to-sich a pass. I s'[osed I should&#xD;
be left to live and die in peace onmolesfed iOn&#xD;
the peraries, with my gun and traps by ny&#xD;
side, and my dogs and losses around me:&#xD;
But we ain't sure o' nothin' in this world but&#xD;
diffikilty, and that we ean count on'with some&#xD;
sartinty. They tetched me in a tender p'int&#xD;
when they put me in print; and doubted the&#xD;

&#xD;
"Pm a modest man," resumed Nicholas,&#xD;
though I have my peculyarities. All I want&#xD;
is, to be let alone."&#xD;
The speaker brought his rifle down upon&#xD;
the ground emphatically, and added :&#xD;
"Nick Whiffies wants to be left alone-left&#xD;
alone to tell his stories, to have his joke, to&#xD;
live out his own life in his own way. Oh, yes!"&#xD;
The free trapper fell back a little, chewed&#xD;
his quid violently, ran his eyes up and down&#xD;
Nick's tall figure, and said, presently, in a&#xD;
voice thickened with tobacco juice :&#xD;
"So you're Nick Whiffles ?  Guess so!d&#xD;
Pooty likely!"'&#xD;
"6What am I to understand' by that 2" de-&#xD;
manded Nicholas, tartly.&#xD;
"4That I'm not a woolly sheep !" answered&#xD;
the trapper, with a grin.&#xD;
"I don't git at your meanin' yit, precisely.&#xD;
Be a little more plainer, if 'tisn't too much&#xD;
trouble," continued Nick, quietly.&#xD;
" Don't throw dust in my eyes, and I won't&#xD;
wink I" said the trapper, with provoking cool-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
oI don't like to have a man begin my&#xD;
'quaintance by doubtin' my word," responded&#xD;
Nick, with warmth. "If you can't believe a&#xD;
person when he tells you his name, you must&#xD;
be a faithless critter ; and I calkilate that we&#xD;
can't hitch losses together, nohow. I a'n't&#xD;
quarrelsome, lout I want to be believed when&#xD;
'm tellin' the simple truth. The Lord knows&#xD;
that I a'n't proud o' my name ; and for the&#xD;
r reasons I've give, should very well like to for-&#xD;
git it. But if you doubt my veracity, I'm&#xD;
afeard there'll be a diffikilty atween us."&#xD;
"You threaten, eh ? Goin' to scare me,&#xD;
a'n't ye ' Come now, that's good, Mr. Double-&#xD;
ark, Darkdouble, or Doubledark, I shall knock&#xD;
under right away. Uh !". The trapper fin-.&#xD;
ished his remarks with a grunt that might&#xD;
have honored a grizzly bear.&#xD;
"Before we go an further, I' should like&#xD;
some kind of a handle to handle you by !"&#xD;
said Nick."&#xD;
" Take Jack Wiley, and handle me by that;&#xD;
and rather keerfully, too, for there's some&#xD;
glass in me, and I may break with rough&#xD;
usage."&#xD;
"Glass, and brass, too I" muttered Nick.&#xD;
'iJes' so, if you like it. As for Ingin nick-&#xD;
names, I a'n't a whit behind any free trapper&#xD;
in the country, but have got as, many and as&#xD;
long. Some call me the Medicine-Calf."&#xD;
"1Should like to hear ye bleat, Mister."&#xD;
" One tribe calls me Two Hundred Hosses,&#xD;
because'I run off a drove o' losses of jest that&#xD;
number, one night, from their camp. But&#xD;
come, I don't feel disposed to quarrel with a&#xD;
man who has done.me a good-turn, even if he&#xD;
does undertake to gammnon me a little."&#xD;
" Well, be it so ; but if things hadn't been&#xD;
as they are atween us, I'd made you believe&#xD;
that the moon was made of buffaler-humps,&#xD;
and you's roast a slice .on't-oma stick. But,&#xD;
come on, Jack Wiley, let's foller this ridge."&#xD;
&#xD;
"It'll take us ruther too near 4he MQek&#xD;
City to be altogether agreeable 1" returned&#xD;
Wiley, as Nick moved onward.&#xD;
" That's clear Ingin," said Nick. " White&#xD;
men never ought to git sich notions into their&#xD;
heads. I've heerd o' this rocky city afore,&#xD;
but never believed there was anythin' onna-&#xD;
teral about it, less a mountain-sheep or a poor&#xD;
root-digger are sunthin' out the common&#xD;
course."&#xD;
"I don't pertend to be any wiser nor my&#xD;
neighbors, and shall speak only for myself ;&#xD;
but I shall give Trapper Valley and that&#xD;
mountain a wide berth. It's said that them&#xD;
that enter Trapper Valley never find their&#xD;
way out, and a'n't never heerd on ag'in. The&#xD;
Ingins think the place enchanted by a bad&#xD;
spirit, and that everybody, who unfortinitly&#xD;
gits into it, becomes immediately lost, and is&#xD;
doomed to wander up and down, looking for&#xD;
a way out all the rest of his days.  You&#xD;
needn't shake your head ; I tell ye they've&#xD;
been seen there, Mr. Doubledark."&#xD;
" Well, I won't dispute the p'int, though I&#xD;
never 'spect to see anythin' worse nor I am&#xD;
wherever I may go. I never could see sperits&#xD;
myself, but I had a niece that eerld see 'em&#xD;
in quantities to suit customers. You-c heerd&#xD;
o' my family, I allow. 'There was my gran'-&#xD;
father, the traveler, and my uncle, the bistc-&#xD;
rian, that were oncommon in their line o' busi-&#xD;
ness.  I know that folks have shook their&#xD;
heads and laughed in their sleeves, as 'twere,&#xD;
when I've mentioned their expl'ites, which I&#xD;
have,:occasionally, to keep their memories&#xD;
green."&#xD;
With this kind of conversation to beguile&#xD;
the way, the parties kept on till they reached&#xD;
a spot where they could command a fuller&#xD;
view of the Mimic City, which, looming up&#xD;
spectrally in the moonhght, looked weird and&#xD;
solemn.&#xD;
"Down yender," said Jack Wiley, pointing,&#xD;
" where you see the rocks piled high, is the&#xD;
entrance to Lost Trapper Valley. It is called&#xD;
the Devil's Gate. Havin', as .I told you,&#xD;
trapped at Otter Creek, Beaver Springs, and&#xD;
Black Rock, I've picked up these stories from&#xD;
one and another that I've come across in the&#xD;
way o' business."&#xD;
" You interest yourself more about sich&#xD;
things nor I do. Give me geod trappin' and&#xD;
huntin'-ground, and I won't trouble myself&#xD;
about the superstitions of the Ingins and ig-&#xD;
n'ant white men."&#xD;
Nick suddenly paused, then added, in a dif-&#xD;
ferent tone :&#xD;
"Jack Wiley, look there, among the rocks,&#xD;
and see if them is some of your hobgob.&#xD;
lines !"&#xD;
"Where--where ?" demanded Wiley.&#xD;
" Don't you see 'em movin' silently 'mong&#xD;
the rocks ?"&#xD;
"Yes, I do ; and we'd better be going , 'less&#xD;
we should see somethin' worse 1" responded&#xD;
Wiley, hurriedly.&#xD;

PATHAWAY ; OR, THE&#xD;
"You can go where youplease, Mr. Two&#xD;
Hundred Hosses ; but my eyes was give me&#xD;
for service, and I shall use 'em."  "&#xD;
Nick's attention had been attracted by the&#xD;
discovery of several persons gliding among&#xD;
the rocks in single file. They were not so far&#xD;
distant, but he could see them very plainly.&#xD;
Their garmentsand manner of walking inti-&#xD;
mated that they were white men, although&#xD;
Nicholas could not positively affirm them to&#xD;
be such. He counted five, and the foremost&#xD;
wore a red sash about his waist. He could&#xD;
see their weapons gleam in the moonlight.&#xD;
Instantly his mind reverted to the scene that&#xD;
had transpired in the little basin, when trying&#xD;
to discover the person, or persons who had&#xD;
stolen his traps. A singular train of thought&#xD;
was at once awakened. He watched with an&#xD;
interest not easily described, the progress of&#xD;
the five figures, while Wiley stood sullen and&#xD;
silent. beside him. Nicholas did not speak.&#xD;
Resting his right arm upon his rifle, with a&#xD;
kind of quiet abstraction of manner,.he fol-&#xD;
lowed with his eyes the movements of the&#xD;
parties among the mimic walls and fragments&#xD;
of the haunted city. They descended to. the&#xD;
bottom of the valley, and were lost to view&#xD;
near the Devil's Gate. Jack Wiley, during this&#xD;
time, was observing his- countenance closely.&#xD;
" What do you think on't 1"' he asked, ab-&#xD;
ruptly,.&#xD;
" That it's not an oncommon thing to see&#xD;
trappers in this part of the country !" answer-&#xD;
ed Nicholas, drily.&#xD;
"Not sich as them-not sich as them !"&#xD;
muttered Wiley. " I've one piece of advice&#xD;
to give you, stranger ; and I do it out of gra-&#xD;
titude for the good turn you've done me :&#xD;
Shun Trapper Valley, the City of Rocks, and&#xD;
the country hereabout, as you. would a war-&#xD;
party of Blackfeet, or the plague, or the pes-&#xD;
tilence,,or anything that's dangerous and to be&#xD;
feared."&#xD;
" I thank ye, Jack Wiley, for the warnin';&#xD;
but I'm not afeard of man or goblin. I've&#xD;
walked the woods, and mountains, and prai-&#xD;
ries many years, and there's no place that I,&#xD;
fear more nor another. All spots atween Co-&#xD;
lumbia River and Hudson's Bay are alike to&#xD;
me.   I know the haunts of the. wolf, the&#xD;
grizzly, the panther, and all the destructive&#xD;
animiles of this region, as well as all the vil-&#xD;
lages, trampin', campin', and huntin'-grounds&#xD;
of the red pison sarpents ; and I go to and&#xD;
fro as one who understands his craft, and has&#xD;
-taken the measure of his compacity to meet&#xD;
sarcumstances and govern 'em."&#xD;
Nicholas uttered these words with decision ;&#xD;
and shouldering his rifle, resumed his way&#xD;
with. the firm step of one who has confidence&#xD;
in his own judgment and foresight.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
THE GRAY HUNTER,&#xD;
The youth -Sebastian - Delaunay-having&#xD;
.  ached the plateau, entered a small hut hid-&#xD;
&#xD;
0&#xD;
&#xD;
MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS.                       11&#xD;
den in a growth of cotton-wood. The dogs&#xD;
followed him, looking back, occasionally, in&#xD;
the direction their master had taken. A fire&#xD;
was blazing in the centre of the hut, beside&#xD;
which he seated himself For a while he be-&#xD;
guiled the time by adjusting feathers to the&#xD;
shafts of some arrows, while phis canine com-&#xD;
panions, stretched at his feet, observed his&#xD;
operations with half-closed eyes and sleepy&#xD;
good-nature. Wearying of this employment,&#xD;
and anxious for the return of Nicholas, he-&#xD;
took down an Indian long-bow that hung&#xD;
against the wall of the hut, and after stringiig&#xD;
it carefully, buckled a well-filled quiver across.&#xD;
his shoulders, then made his way to the spot&#xD;
where hehad parted with the trapper. It was&#xD;
dark ; but the dogs, taking the scent of their&#xD;
master, ran along before him, thus guiding&#xD;
him to the valley. Like a sleepless sentinel,&#xD;
he kept faithful watch upon the cliffs until&#xD;
the moon came up, sometimes talking with the&#xD;
dogs, at ethers, musing.&#xD;
Suddenly, the dog, Smuggler, erected his&#xD;
ears and pointed his long-nose down the val-&#xD;
ley, which was now faintly silvered over with&#xD;
the moonbeams; his four-footed associate&#xD;
growled and started to his feet, and would&#xD;
have bounded down the mountain-side had not&#xD;
Sebastian restrained him.&#xD;
The youth was well enough acquainted with&#xD;
the habits of the dog to know that he had seen&#xD;
or scented either man or beast ; but it was in&#xD;
vain, however, that he taxed his powers of&#xD;
vision to see any animated thing. - A cluster&#xD;
of dwarfed pinon farther down the declivity,&#xD;
within a few rods of the bed of the valley,&#xD;
offering a better and more sheltered point of&#xD;
observation, he descended to it.&#xD;
The advantage of this movement was im-&#xD;
mediately manifest ; for, straining his eyes.,&#xD;
southward, he beheld a figure approaching.'&#xD;
It was a white man, but evidently not Nicho-&#xD;
las - there being a palpable difference in&#xD;
height and garb, apparent even at that dis-&#xD;
tance. Sebastian regarded his advance with&#xD;
a singular feeling of curiosity.  He .was&#xD;
young--.he judged by his elastic step, and&#xD;
straight, lithe form. As he drew nearer, he&#xD;
perceived that his garments were of coarse,&#xD;
gray stuff, differing materialfy in cut and fit&#xD;
from those of the hunter and trapper-show-&#xD;
ing, perhaps, that he was fresher from  the&#xD;
haunts of civilization.  Of his features and&#xD;
complexion, the youth could form no opinion-&#xD;
and it was only when the moon's silver rays fell&#xD;
upon him, that he could arrive at conclusions&#xD;
respecting his garb and equipments.   His&#xD;
arms consisted of a two-barreled carbine, slung&#xD;
to his .back by a strap. Beneath a plain&#xD;
leather belt he wore the indispensable hunt-&#xD;
ing-knife, and the ever-convenient pistols with&#xD;
which writers of fiction provide their heroes,&#xD;
brigands,-and adventurers.&#xD;
Though alone, and in the heart of a savage&#xD;
country, the young hunter (we will call him&#xD;
such) looked brave and self-reliant-at least,&#xD;

"Throw down your weapons !" vociferated&#xD;
Bill Brace.&#xD;
"Yes, down with your weapon !" repeated&#xD;
Ben Joice.&#xD;
" Down with your two-shooter 1" said Zene&#xD;
Beck, in a threatening voice.  .&#xD;
The hunter's figure grew more erect and de-&#xD;
fiant. His countenance, so mild in expression&#xD;
a few moments before, was now firm and reso-&#xD;
lute.&#xD;
Bill Brace laid his hand upon the handle of&#xD;
a formidable bowie-knife, and advanced his&#xD;
right foot. The hunter cocked his carbine.&#xD;
"Look you, fellows! There are three of&#xD;
you opposed to one. The first man of you&#xD;
that makes an aggressive movement, I will&#xD;
shoot as I would a turkey-buzzard. I hold&#xD;
you to be outlaws, adventurers, vagabonds, and&#xD;
not true men. If you wish a quarrel, I will&#xD;
meet either one of you on fair and equal&#xD;
terms, whether it be with rifle, pistol, knife, or&#xD;
the weapons which Nature has provided."&#xD;
Bill Brace elevated his burly shoulders, and&#xD;
laughed scornfully ; but there was more anger&#xD;
than merriment in the demonstration.&#xD;
"You crow loud for a cock fresh from feather-&#xD;
beds. Tryin' to imitate the giniwine game,&#xD;
ain't ye ? Going' to scare grizzly-bear eaters, I&#xD;
reckon. You'll fight Bill Brace, will ye ?"&#xD;
The fellow stood with his gun before him,&#xD;
the breech upon the ground, both hands upon&#xD;
the muzzle, his body bent, and his bearded,&#xD;
dirty chin thrust forward. , Never was the de-&#xD;
mon of the perverse and insolent more palpa-&#xD;
bly pictured. Dwelling afar from the restraints&#xD;
of civil law, cut loose from all the forms and&#xD;
conventionalities of society, following his own&#xD;
wayward impulses unchecked and unques-&#xD;
tioned, pampering his wild appetites, aping&#xD;
Indian habits--their vices, not their virtues-&#xD;
with full faith in his brute powers, he had de-&#xD;
veloped into a full-grown ruffian of the savage&#xD;
and uncivilized sort.  Backed by kindred&#xD;
spirits, with no moral curb upon his passions&#xD;
and desires, he believed that he was not only&#xD;
a law unto himself, but to others.&#xD;
The gray hunter, though taller, was of&#xD;
lighter build. He had more symmetry, and&#xD;
less prominence of muscle. The individual&#xD;
would have been hypocritical who faulted his&#xD;
proportions. His configuration gave promise&#xD;
of quickness and suppleness ; but his frame&#xD;
did not appear of sufficient hardihood to con-&#xD;
tend with the muscular insulter before him.&#xD;
But Sebastian observed that he was cool and&#xD;
steady, unshaken by the usually attendant&#xD;
trepidation of anger and danger.&#xD;
"1Do you hear it,.Ben Joice, and you, Zene&#xD;
Beck? This soft-bearded-this tender infant&#xD;
--this pulin' manger de lard will meet Bill&#xD;
Brace with any weapons, from. his fists to a&#xD;
blunderbuss 1"&#xD;
In a paroxysm of comical, yet inexpressible&#xD;
&#xD;
MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS.                       IS&#xD;
contempt, Brace plucked off his fur cap by its&#xD;
swinging tail, threw it upon the ground, and&#xD;
trampled upon it, while his companions mani-&#xD;
fested their admiration in various ways ; one&#xD;
by thrusting two fingers into his mouth, and&#xD;
whistling through them-the other, by dou-&#xD;
bling himself up, and pretending to be strug-&#xD;
gling with irrepressible laughter, of a nature&#xD;
the most ludicrous possible.&#xD;
The gray hunter remained perfectly tran-&#xD;
quil, with his carbine still in a position to be&#xD;
instantly available.&#xD;
" Milk-drinker, I take that challenge! lie,&#xD;
he ! ho, ho ! Jest-think on't, boys ; he's going'&#xD;
to tackle Bill Brace, the raw catamount-eater&#xD;
-the double-barreled bully of the Saskatche-&#xD;
wan 1"  Then, to the young man: "Jes' say&#xD;
how you'll go out the world, mister, and it's&#xD;
done! Will ye have lead, or steel, or grizzly-&#xD;
bear paws, which is the nateral weapons, as you&#xD;
call 'em ?"&#xD;
" We'll begin with the weapon's of Nature ;&#xD;
then, if you are not satisfied, the bowie-knife&#xD;
shall decide who is to be buried in this valley !"&#xD;
"As for that matter, I can tell ye aforehand.&#xD;
We don't take the trouble to bury folks herea-&#xD;
bouts ; the wolves are the undertakers in the&#xD;
mountains ; they make short work on't, and&#xD;
nothin' to pay for grave-diggin' and services.&#xD;
But we're wastin' the precious time. Say&#xD;
your prayers as quick as ye can, and I'll swal-&#xD;
ler ye !"&#xD;
"Moderately, moderately, my double-bar-&#xD;
reled ruffian! There are conditions to this&#xD;
duel ; the arms of yourself and friends must&#xD;
be deposited by that cluster of pines ; then&#xD;
your comrades must withdraw to yonder rook,&#xD;
and remain passive spectators of the contest,&#xD;
let it turn.which way it may. As for myself,&#xD;
I will place my weapons by this tree behind me"&#xD;
where I can easily get at them in case of trea-&#xD;
chery and bad faith."&#xD;
To this proposition Brace at first objected,&#xD;
but finally assented ; and the weapons of the&#xD;
party, after some delay, were disposed of as&#xD;
stipulated by the hunter. Sebastian held&#xD;
tightly upon the muzzles of the dogs while&#xD;
this part of the business was being performed ;&#xD;
for the arms were deposited within a few yards&#xD;
of his hiding-place. Smuggler rebelled a little&#xD;
as Ben Joice drew near, in the discharge -of&#xD;
this duty, and the dog Misfortune actually&#xD;
growled, as if his name was ominous ; but the&#xD;
sound did not attract attention.&#xD;
Beck and Joice retired to the spot desig-&#xD;
nated, which placed several yards' between&#xD;
them and their arms, and about the same dis-&#xD;
tance from Brace and his antagonist. The&#xD;
former cast off his hunting-shirt, and bared his&#xD;
stalwart arms, like a tnan who wishes to get at&#xD;
his work as soon as may be ; while the latter,&#xD;
having laid his gun, pistols, and hunting-knife&#xD;
at the roots of a cotton-wood, deliberately di-&#xD;
vested himself of his gray"frock, and tightened&#xD;
his waist-belt. His lithe, syinmetrical figure&#xD;
was now displayed, i st il''ntraat to the&#xD;

PATHAWAY ; OR, TAE MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
stout and unshapely proportions of Brace, who,&#xD;
to all outward appearance, had a physical su-&#xD;
periority, weighing at least a hundred and&#xD;
eighty pounds, while the weight of the other&#xD;
could not exceed a hundred and fifty pounds.&#xD;
"Stranger," said Brace, with mock serious-&#xD;
ness, " you'd better tell me your name before&#xD;
I devour you ; as some of your friends may&#xD;
want to set up a stone over your bones if they&#xD;
should ofdance to hear what kind of an eend&#xD;
you made !"&#xD;
" Should I be assassinated here by you, or&#xD;
yonder cutthroats, an adventurer by the name'&#xD;
of Pathaway will be missed among the moun-&#xD;
tains. Are you ready, Bill Brace ?"&#xD;
"All.ready !" responded Brace.&#xD;
"Then come on, and get what you have&#xD;
long deserved !"-&#xD;
The young man advanced his right foot and&#xD;
arm, then the left with the corresponding arm,&#xD;
and "dressed up " to his antagonist. His&#xD;
right arm was now drawn back like a bent bow,&#xD;
his left hand forward, while his eyes were fixed&#xD;
steadily upon those of Brace, who came on&#xD;
with a great flourish, intending to bear down&#xD;
his antagonist by mere force of muscle. He&#xD;
led off with his right, and received a return-in&#xD;
his mouth with Pathaway's left. It was at&#xD;
once evident that the latter understood the art&#xD;
of self-defence, while the former was ignorant&#xD;
of its advantages, confident that brute strength-&#xD;
was all that was- required in an encounter of&#xD;
that nature.&#xD;
" The youngster's drawed the first blood !"&#xD;
cried Joice. " Look out for him, Bill !"&#xD;
Surprised at this rebuff, Brace fell back, and&#xD;
noticed that his beard was changing its color&#xD;
from dark to red.&#xD;
" Time !" shouted Joice, derisively.&#xD;
At the second round, Brace advanced more&#xD;
cautiously, manifesting an intention to end the&#xD;
matter by one crushing blow. He led off with&#xD;
his right again, when Pathaway cross-coun-&#xD;
tered, and gave him a heavy fall.- Joice and&#xD;
Beck greeted this event with noisy laughter,&#xD;
thinking that their champion was " playing&#xD;
off," in order to come off with more honor by-&#xD;
and-by, when he had tampered with the&#xD;
youngster long enough to suit his purpose.&#xD;
":Get up, Bill; what are you tumblin' about&#xD;
in that way for'?" said Joice.      .&#xD;
" There's a good 'eal of 'possum in Bill,"&#xD;
observed Beck, hopefully.&#xD;
" Yes, indeed! he'll peg into him by-and-&#xD;
bye. He'll whip that youngster till he won't&#xD;
know tie moon from a fire-bug !"&#xD;
b]ill Joice was now in a furious passion. He&#xD;
at Pathaway, roaring like a buffalo-&#xD;
bull. He struck right and left ; his arms&#xD;
swung about like flails, always striking&#xD;
the air-never his antagonist-who, dressed&#xD;
under those active members to the left, to the&#xD;
right, planting his blows wherever he pleased.&#xD;
Joice called "Time" again, and the bully was&#xD;
evidentlygladto rest. He scanned his more&#xD;
youthful antagonist from under his depressed&#xD;
&#xD;
and heavy brows, with mingled ferocity, ma-.&#xD;
levolence, and amazement. He wondered what&#xD;
had become of his own strength, and on what&#xD;
object his hot wrath had fallen. He mouthed,&#xD;
and scowled on Pathaway, with the swelling&#xD;
fury of a bafled and tantalized beast of prey.&#xD;
The man who had given the somewhat unique&#xD;
name of Pathaway, maintained his calmness ;,&#xD;
and, with his arms folded upon his breast, met&#xD;
the flaming glances of the ruffian trapper, un-&#xD;
moved.&#xD;
Ben Joice and Zene Beck unconsciously drew&#xD;
nearer ; they were becoming deeply interested&#xD;
in the contest. Sebastian, too, fascinated by&#xD;
the exciting spectacle, raised himself to obtain&#xD;
a better view; and the dogs, equally sympa-&#xD;
thetic, arose upon their haunches.&#xD;
. Brace, panting like a steam-engine, with a&#xD;
startling oath, dashed again at the hunter, who,&#xD;
passing under the belligerent arm, plunged his&#xD;
left like a bullet under his right ear. Brace&#xD;
fell like a bullock in the shambles-got up in&#xD;
a flurry, striking more wildly than ever. Now,&#xD;
for the first time, the gray hunter began to&#xD;
show his marvelous power; he aimed his blows&#xD;
with a skill that was never baffled, and the&#xD;
face of the bully was soon reduced to a pulpy&#xD;
and unsightly mass. The blood rained down&#xD;
his beard, and reddened his broad and heaving&#xD;
chest. He fell every moment, and scarcely&#xD;
had strength to rise, while the small fists of&#xD;
Pathaway played upon him like iron bolts.&#xD;
An upward blow, like a lightning stroke, under&#xD;
the chin, gave Bill Brace the coup de grace-&#xD;
stretching him senseless upon the ground. !&#xD;
" So let brutal insolence be punished !"&#xD;
cried the hunter. Then, turning to Joice and&#xD;
Beek, with a lofty and scornful air, added :&#xD;
" Which of you will take his turn next ?"&#xD;
Presently, Brace began to revive ; there&#xD;
was too much brute hardihood in him to re-&#xD;
main long passive. He blustered to his feet,&#xD;
hurling impotent imprecations upon his con-&#xD;
queror ; but, too weak to stand, fell with a&#xD;
helplessness that made every joint in his body&#xD;
crack. But, though deprived of physical&#xD;
power, he still command had his vocal organs,&#xD;
" Your bowie-knives, men!t Cut up the&#xD;
rascal as you would a slaughtered buffalo.&#xD;
He's the devil !i-at him, Ben Joice! Give&#xD;
him plenty of steel, Zene Beck, and I'll be&#xD;
your debtor forever I"&#xD;
Quick as thought, Pathaway put his hand&#xD;
to the back of his neck, and drew forth one of&#xD;
those terrible weapons that bear the famed&#xD;
name of the great Texan fighter-Bowie, the&#xD;
brave, the dashing, the daring. The bright,&#xD;
silvery, two-edged blade flashed rapidly in the&#xD;
air, reflecting the moonlight like the.facets of&#xD;
a diamond.&#xD;
Joice and Beck drew the -same weapons&#xD;
from their leggings, and were in- the act of&#xD;
springing forward, with an uicivilized, free-&#xD;
trapper shout, when they were arrested by the&#xD;
gladiator attitude and gleaning blade of the&#xD;
gray hunter.&#xD;

"Cowards !" he shouted --" why do yo&#xD;
pause ? Come on, and the mangeur de fare&#xD;
will give you a lesson in wild-wood manners.'&#xD;
"Don't let him scare you, though he b&#xD;
the devil I" muttered Brace, hoarsely.&#xD;
Ashamed of their weakness and incertitude&#xD;
Joice and Beck advanced upon Pathaway&#xD;
who awaited the onset with rigid muscles and&#xD;
compressed lips. Both sprang at him at once;&#xD;
but, evading them with the same adroitness&#xD;
that had marked his encounter with Brace, he&#xD;
gave Joice a wound upon the right arm thai&#xD;
nearly disabled him. At the same moment, an&#xD;
arrow struck Beek upon the shoulder, and the&#xD;
two dogs, Smuggler and Misfortune, freed from&#xD;
the restraint of Sebastian, charged the trap.&#xD;
pers, baying furiously, while a voice shouted&#xD;
" What's the matter? Hold up ! There's&#xD;
a cussed little diffikilty here-isn't there ?"&#xD;
The combatants paused, and saw a tall fig-&#xD;
ure, clad in bucks kin, with a rifle upon his&#xD;
shoulder, approaching them from the northern&#xD;
stretch of the valley.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
THE HUT.&#xD;
A little in the rear of the tall figure, appear-&#xD;
ed another of lesser altitude, but of greater&#xD;
breadth of shoulder. After the quaint address&#xD;
of Nicholas, the hostile parties suspended their&#xD;
sanguinary operations, with the exception of a&#xD;
few kicks at the dogs (who were inclined to&#xD;
worry them) and considered the new-comers&#xD;
with interest. .&#xD;
"Be. quiet, Smuggler ! Down, Misfortin!&#xD;
It's best to inquire into this business, I reckon.&#xD;
Been a trifle of fightin' here, it''pears,, What&#xD;
critter's this on the ground ? His head looks&#xD;
like a rotten apple, I swear to gracious ! It&#xD;
never could a been a handsome face, that o'&#xD;
his'n. I don't believe my gran'father, in all&#xD;
his travels in Centril Afriky, ever come across&#xD;
sich a speciment-of human natur'; though he&#xD;
seed niggers with tails, apes that could talk,&#xD;
and monkeys that had real military musters,&#xD;
with captains and gin'rals, majors, and corpo-&#xD;
rals.",&#xD;
The dogs became silent at the voice of their&#xD;
master, who now turned slowly to Pathaway,&#xD;
and began a philosophical and by no means&#xD;
hurried examination of his person, keeping up&#xD;
a running accompaniment of remarks.'&#xD;
" Stranger, you've licked him like p'isou !&#xD;
I don't know the beginnin' nor the eend on't,&#xD;
nor whose side justice is on; but, by the looks,&#xD;
should say it was on your'n."&#xD;
" I believe it is, sir. I was forced to defend&#xD;
myself, or submit to robbery, or worse. I&#xD;
trust I have taught that bully a lesson that&#xD;
e'll remember  uring the, remainder of his&#xD;
life," answered Pathaway, pointing to Brace,&#xD;
who was lying upon the ground in a sorry&#xD;
plight.&#xD;
" He must have a short memory, if he for-&#xD;
gita it! I must say, mister, that you don't&#xD;
&#xD;
u look capable of handlin' sich a big lump o&#xD;
d flesh. But you've give him enough on't, and&#xD;
" don't 'pear to be cut up much yourself. What&#xD;
e was the mean skunk doin' all the while ?"&#xD;
" Accordi' to his brute - instincts-wasting&#xD;
his strength in ill-aimed blows, striking out&#xD;
like an. old woman, instead of straight from the&#xD;
I shoulder, trying to perform with his threats&#xD;
and invectives what should have been done&#xD;
s with skillfully-directed bone and muscle."&#xD;
" You're a trump, by gracious ! As you&#xD;
t stan' there, you 'mind me of my uncle, the his-&#xD;
torian. He was about the same height, only&#xD;
shorter. lHe had an arm like your'n, only&#xD;
longer. His legs was the very picters of&#xD;
them you stan' on, on'y his was bowed out a&#xD;
good 'eal, and wasn't so straight, as.'twere.&#xD;
His countenance was more open nor yours,&#xD;
'cause his mouth was a third wider. A re-,&#xD;
mai-kable nose had my uncle. I've never met&#xD;
one like it till I see your'n;. but 'twas a" heap.&#xD;
bigger, stranger-a heap bigger ! I seed it&#xD;
once in the night with the moonbeams shinin'&#xD;
on it, and it looked like a cock o' hay. Ah i&#xD;
sich an orgin as it was ! 'Twas jest in his line,&#xD;
howsomnever, for bein' a historian, he could&#xD;
smell out facks that he couldn't git no other&#xD;
way."&#xD;
The gray hunter smiled. There were no&#xD;
traces of the recent excitement upon his face ;&#xD;
it was now pleasant in expression. The mus-&#xD;
cles that had been as rigid as steel bands had&#xD;
relaxed their unnatural tension, and now look-&#xD;
ed white and soft as a woman's. The gladia-&#xD;
tor spirit in his eyes was quenched ; he was no&#xD;
longer the implacable and pitiless avenger, but&#xD;
the composed and quiet looker-on. He had&#xD;
dexterously concealed his weapon about his&#xD;
person, and now-proceeded to put on his gray&#xD;
frock.&#xD;
The trapper outlaws listened to this collo-&#xD;
quy, which passed quickly, in silence, when&#xD;
en Joice approached Nick's companion, who&#xD;
had been making various gesticulations and&#xD;
pantomimic signs.&#xD;
" Why don't you speak, Jack Wiley, instead&#xD;
of makin' an ape of.yourself by noddin' and&#xD;
flourishin' and holdin' your fingers on your&#xD;
lips? Ain't ashamed of our company, be ye ?&#xD;
Haven't forgot old acquaintances, I s'pose ?"&#xD;
" Don't!" said Wiley, edging up to Joice,&#xD;
and speaking in a - low voice, shielding his&#xD;
mouth with his open hand on the side nearest&#xD;
Nick,&#xD;
 "'Don't?' what the deuce do you mean ?"&#xD;
said Ben, gruffly.&#xD;
" Haven't you any sense, man? I don't want&#xD;
you to know me too well afore this tall, talka-&#xD;
tive feller. He's one that we shall have to&#xD;
watch sumw'at. The Injuns, he says, call him&#xD;
Doubledark ; and if they do, you may depend&#xD;
on't, he's a sly one.  I shouldn't wonder if&#xD;
he's sent on purpose to look arter us, though&#xD;
he's done me a good turn. He's lookin' atus;&#xD;
don't talk to me too much."&#xD;
Nick's observant eyes had already noted their&#xD;
&#xD;
of&#xD;

conduct, and he perceived, with ready acumen,&#xD;
that they were birds of similar plumage.&#xD;
"Young man," he said, addressing the gray&#xD;
hunter, " your work seems to be done here ; I&#xD;
think you'd better go with me. These men&#xD;
don'teowe you much good-will, and the quicker&#xD;
you part company, the better for both."&#xD;
"I accept your offer," answered Pathaway,&#xD;
courteously; "glad to escape these outlaws&#xD;
with my life."&#xD;
"Come, Jack Wiley, if you're goin' with me.&#xD;
It's time to leave these merry companions.&#xD;
They're little too free in their notions to make&#xD;
them safe and agreeable comrades of the camp&#xD;
fire."&#xD;
Bill.Brace staggered to his feet, and leaning&#xD;
against Joice, indulged in a storm of invective&#xD;
and menace, interspersed with Indian and&#xD;
French, that could find its parallel in the Nor'-&#xD;
west only, among'the hybrid and lawless trap-&#xD;
pers.&#xD;
"Bill 'Brace has a memory like an Injun !&#xD;
Wa , wa! Youngster, you've tetched a fire-&#xD;
brand tthe nose of'the grizzly bear I" he&#xD;
roared, shaking his fist with the unsteadiness&#xD;
of a drunken man.&#xD;
"Should say he'd tetched it with sumthin'&#xD;
harder'n a fire-brand," remarked Nic .&#xD;
"I'm trapper and Igin ! Wa ! whoop !&#xD;
More Ingin than trapper. I'll have your blood,&#xD;
you pork-eater i I'll foller ye night and day..&#xD;
I'm Bill Brace, and nobody shall live to say&#xD;
thathe's whipped me. Kill him, Jack Wiley,&#xD;
and I'll give ye a hundred beaver-skins !&#xD;
Where's your pistils, you sneaks? I--I--I&#xD;
feel faint. Git me some water, Ben. My head's&#xD;
floatin' all about ; layie down, or I shalttum-&#xD;
ble." Bill Brace, pressed heavily upon his&#xD;
companion, who laid him upon the ground in&#xD;
a partial swoon.S&#xD;
Nick moved from the spot, the dogs jump-&#xD;
ing about biu.,&#xD;
"Sebasti id 1,Sebastian ! What, ho ! Sebas-&#xD;
tian !" helihouted.&#xD;
Snuggle .darted forward to the cluster of&#xD;
pines an.;eommeneed barking. Nick hurried&#xD;
to him at once ; he found the youth lyingin-&#xD;
sensible, with his bow in his left hand. He&#xD;
raised him tenderly in hie arms,&#xD;
Poor lad ! poor lad I" he muttered.." He's&#xD;
seen that terrible fightand it's beentoo much,&#xD;
for his nerves." Then to T'athaway,''He' not&#xD;
a strong boy, mister ; he hasn't been very well.&#xD;
lately. Measles or sumthin'; and 'tisn't .the&#xD;
measles, neither."'&#xD;
A smilecurled the lips of the gray hunter ;&#xD;
but the moment he obtained fair viewr of&#xD;
Sebastiap's face, it gave p1i4e to an expression&#xD;
of sympathy and surprise..-&#xD;
"A bois bruid f"'Ee murmured,&#xD;
"What kind of a;oy " asked  iek, some-}&#xD;
what startled.,&#xD;
"4 ABois brtl,epgeted Pathaway.&#xD;
'He's a good boy,=whatever kind of a boy&#xD;
he may be besides. He's so kind, so gentle,&#xD;
and then he's got sich sperit! He's limpy as&#xD;
&#xD;
a rag now, but he'll stiffen up by-and-by, and&#xD;
be as peart and brave as a Camanche chief.&#xD;
His systum is let down, and you can't tell what&#xD;
folks is when their systum s is down. He isn't&#xD;
a coward, not a bit on't. 0 Lord I no I"&#xD;
" Are you his father, and is he your son ?"&#xD;
asked Jack Wiley, with a sneer. " His cheeks&#xD;
are a leetle tawny, I observe."&#xD;
"If I'n his father, he's my son, I allow;&#xD;
contrawise, no," responded Nicholas, curtly.&#xD;
Sebastian began to revive ; his large, soft&#xD;
eyes opened upon Nick. A shudder shook his&#xD;
slight person.&#xD;
" Don't think on't, boy, don't think on't ;&#xD;
it's past now and over, and nobody's killed.&#xD;
Somebody'd been killed, if their wounds had&#xD;
been mortal, but they, wasn't. Cheer up !&#xD;
sick things happen every day, on'y you don't&#xD;
see 'em."&#xD;
" What's happened, Nicholas ?" he asked, in&#xD;
a faint voice.&#xD;
" Nothin' of no consequence ; a spugilistic&#xD;
display, in which one o' the parties got con-&#xD;
demnedly injured. How do you feel now, little&#xD;
'un ?"&#xD;
There was much of tenderness in Nick's&#xD;
voice. The boy put his 'hands over his eyes&#xD;
and held them there a moment.&#xD;
Pathaway regarded him with both pity and&#xD;
admi-ation. Thosemall hands seemed so un-&#xD;
fit for the wilderness ; the feet and the form,&#xD;
too, were so ederinate.&#xD;
"A  pretty lad! a pretty' lad " murmured&#xD;
the gray hunter. "But tod, delicately reared&#xD;
to endure the .ardships; of. this kind of life.&#xD;
He should go back to his*uiet' home on the&#xD;
banks of Red River, or 'wherever that home&#xD;
may bey"&#xD;
" Can you walk now?" asked Nicholas.&#xD;
Then to Pathaway: " Ak! si;, sich a walker&#xD;
as he is when he's in his natural health ! He&#xD;
rides, too, like a monkey. The hoss ish't bri-&#xD;
dled yet that can throw him off. He's never&#xD;
so much stouter than he looks. He come of a&#xD;
'ristocratic family, and wasn't put to work like&#xD;
others of 'his age. His father was a French&#xD;
count, an english duke, a Rooshan prince in&#xD;
disguise, or some ich character; I don't dis-&#xD;
recollect his title exactly. His mother was a&#xD;
half-breed of"very high caste-; the most beau-&#xD;
tiful specinint of, womankind that was ever&#xD;
seen. Bow do you feelnow, little'un?  Hasn't'&#xD;
your walkers'got sti enough to stan' on? If&#xD;
you can't toddle up .the h1ill, I can carry ye,&#xD;

Ni holastoked at the boy very earnestly,&#xD;
who, by ,tb  aid of bis friendly hand, arose.&#xD;
Durig this time he had not become conscious&#xD;
of the presence of thegray hunter ; but now,&#xD;
perceiving hiinwas greatlysurprised, changed&#xD;
color an would have ,fallen, had he not been&#xD;

"7What now, sonny? Do you ,feel the dis-&#xD;

PATHAWAY; OR, THE]&#xD;
ever since he had the whoopin'-cough two year&#xD;
ago and up'ards. It didn't clear off well, the&#xD;
cough didn't ; but settled in his constitution,&#xD;
'specially his limbs. The whole village took&#xD;
it to once, and whooped so like p'ison that all&#xD;
the Injins in the kentry took to their heels. It's&#xD;
a disease that never ought to be 'lowed the,&#xD;
north side o' the Rocky Mountains."&#xD;
While Nick was making these apologies and&#xD;
explanations, he held the youth upon his left&#xD;
arm and poured some whisky into his mouth.&#xD;
The fiery liquid went burning down his throat,&#xD;
producing a paroxysm of strangulation, which,&#xD;
though attended with danger, had the effect to&#xD;
restore him to consciousness. 'He smiled faint-&#xD;
ly, and said that he was quite well again.&#xD;
"Sartin !" responded Nick, good-naturedly.&#xD;
"'Twant nothing' in the world but appleplexy,&#xD;
which isn't serious till you've had it a few times.'&#xD;
My brother, Doctor Whiffiles, used to cure it&#xD;
'thout diffikilty with red precipity and yaller&#xD;
ochre."&#xD;
"' Not a common remedy," remarked Patha-&#xD;
way.&#xD;
"Yes, it wasn't a common.remedy ; it wa'n't&#xD;
known to nobody but my brother, and the se-&#xD;
cret died with him. Will inform ye some time&#xD;
how be came to a full stop., Ah! your legs is&#xD;
a little shaky yet, but they'll grow stronger&#xD;
with use, and longer, too. Lean on me, and&#xD;
don't be afraid of tirin' inc."&#xD;
" You'd better have a nuss and a wagon&#xD;
for him !" said Wiley, squinting maliciously.&#xD;
" I know folks," retorted Nick, invidiously,&#xD;
"who need a cart and a hangman ; though,&#xD;
mind ye, I don't say I've seen any sich to-&#xD;
night."&#xD;
" Children should have their suppers early,&#xD;
and be put to bed," added squint-eyed Jack&#xD;
pretending not to notice the innuendo conveyed&#xD;
in the trapper's reply. "I never liked puny&#xD;
milk-sop boys, that faint' away like gals, and&#xD;
turn pale at the sight o' blood. Boys a'n't&#xD;
what they used to be afore the settlements got&#xD;
so thick."&#xD;
" Everything changes !" said Pathaway.&#xD;
" There are free trappers who a're not what&#xD;
they should be."&#xD;
" I a'n't in no hurry to quarrel with you,&#xD;
mister. You can wait Jack Wiley's time,&#xD;
can't ye ?"&#xD;
The squint-eyed'growled and looked askance&#xD;
at the hunter ; there was both malice and&#xD;
menace in his fa'ce.&#xD;
Sebastian toiled slowly up the ascent, assist-&#xD;
ed by the careful Nick. They reached the&#xD;
plateau, and entered the hut. The fire was&#xD;
renewed, and the parties were soon more pal-&#xD;
pally revealed to each other in the bright&#xD;
glare. The youth's' eyes often wandered to&#xD;
l'athaway, who, in turn, as often looked at the&#xD;
boy. While he felt compassion for his weak..&#xD;
ness, he admired his uncommon beauty. He&#xD;
received with. courtesy Nick's abundant pro-&#xD;
teslations respecting ~the lad's bravery and&#xD;
&#xD;
MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS.                      19&#xD;
hardihood, while at the same time he more&#xD;
than half doubted the trapper's ingenuousness.&#xD;
The latter bestirred himself with cheerful ala-&#xD;
erity in preparing a comfortable supper, of&#xD;
which the gray hunter and Sebastian partoolk&#xD;
sparingly, while Jack Wiley devoured not only&#xD;
his own proportion, but infringed upon that&#xD;
of his neighbors. Inffact, he was blessed with&#xD;
the appetite of a fasting bear, and swallowed&#xD;
the roasted buffalo-meat with astonishing fiei-&#xD;
lity.&#xD;
Sebastian, at first, honored this individual&#xD;
with but little attention ; but when the fire.&#xD;
light revealed his features, he became the ob-&#xD;
ject of closer notice, which was returned on&#xD;
his part by long and stupid stares, which did&#xD;
not interfere at all with the process of miasti-&#xD;
cation.' The gray hunter, having finished his&#xD;
abstemious repast, threw himself carelessly&#xD;
upon a buffalo skin, which his thoughtful host&#xD;
spread for his accommodation. Wiley, pro-&#xD;
vided with a pipe by the same hand, and dis-&#xD;
posed of in similar fashion, abandoned hitt-&#xD;
self contentedly to the dreamy enjoyment of&#xD;
smoke, sustained and kept in countenance by&#xD;
his entertainer.&#xD;
The youth, drawing a scarlet blanket about&#xD;
him, snuggled cosily and timidly into a corner&#xD;
of the hut, anxious, visibly, to shun observa-&#xD;
tion ; while Nick, as if by accident, but pro-&#xD;
bably with a view to favor his wishes, placed&#xD;
himself partially between him and his guest.&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
THE DEVIL'S GATE.&#xD;
Conversation flagged. The pipe dropped&#xD;
from Jack Wiley's lips, he sank back into a&#xD;
horizontal position, and slept.  The others&#xD;
soon followed his example, and everything&#xD;
was quiet in the solitary hut. Wiley opened&#xD;
his eyes, raised his head, contemplated the&#xD;
sleepers a moment, then arose and walked out&#xD;
softly. The dog Smuggler aroused a little,&#xD;
but seeigg no occasion for watching his was-&#xD;
ter's guest, returned again to his canine&#xD;
dreams. Free of the hut, Wiley crossed the&#xD;
plateau rapidly. Nick's horse was! grazing&#xD;
with equine satisfaction -upon its -margin.&#xD;
" It's not 'a handsome beast I" muttered&#xD;
Jack, "but he has good p'ints. His mane is&#xD;
rather shaggy, but his tail is a beauty, and&#xD;
them is nice legs, too, for speed - they're&#xD;
anyooth, clean, and parfict in the "ints. I like&#xD;
that back, the small head, and ine curve of&#xD;
the neck. 'Twouldbe almost wicked to leave&#xD;
sich a creetur ahind. -I owe the queer feller a&#xD;
good turn, I know; but friendslizg shouldn't&#xD;
interfere with mere matters o' business."&#xD;
Wiley turned the axes of his non-coinci-&#xD;
dent eyes as nearly upon the horse as possible,&#xD;
with a longing, wishful expression. 'hen un-&#xD;
buttoning his hunting-shirt, drew forth a stout&#xD;
lariat that was passed several times.around his&#xD;
person for concealment. He walked confi-&#xD;
dently up to the animal, who'suffered him to&#xD;

approach and adjust the lariat about his neck&#xD;
and nose, This preliminary attended to, Wi-&#xD;
ley leaped upon his back. Shagbark-we will&#xD;
conform to the humor of Nick in the matter&#xD;
of names-started off well enough, and went&#xD;
fifty rods, perhaps, as kindly as a horse could,&#xD;
when he came to a full stop, thrust out his&#xD;
fore-feet, depressed his head between them,&#xD;
threw up his hinder part with a quickness and&#xD;
energy that sent the horse-stealer somer-&#xD;
saulting over his neck. Jack alighted upon&#xD;
his shoulders with a shock that struck sparks&#xD;
o fire from his squint-eyes. For a brief space&#xD;
ho saw nothing but a starry host dancing, cur-&#xD;
veting through the air in the most fantastic&#xD;
M   mainer.&#xD;
Nick Whiffles, meantime, had slumbered s&#xD;
lightly as the ungrateful trapper, and arose&#xD;
and followed him soon after his unceremoni-&#xD;
ous exit. From the cover of the cotton-woods&#xD;
he .saw him seize and mount Shagbark, and&#xD;
ride away, as described. Now the man that&#xD;
the Indianis called Doubledark was not one to&#xD;
submit tamely to the loss of his property, es-&#xD;
pecially when that property was a favorite&#xD;
horse. So, returning to the but for his arms,&#xD;
he ;pursued the offender, and witnessed with&#xD;
feelings which "we will leave entirely to the&#xD;
imagination, the ingrate's misadventure.&#xD;
I knowed he'd do it !" quoth Nick, with&#xD;
pride. noI'd never forgive him if he hadn't.&#xD;
He'd no right to let himself be stole by that&#xD;
mean skunk, who'll git into a prison diffikilty&#xD;
soon if a work o' grace don't take place in his&#xD;
nioril nater. The traitor ! the runagade! to&#xD;
forgit the fate I've saved him from this night.&#xD;
He'll have to be hanged-he'll never be any&#xD;
better till he's hanged."&#xD;
"Them's some o' the tricks that tall critter&#xD;
larned ye, elh . I'll thrash that kind o' stuff&#xD;
out of ye when I git ye into the mountains.&#xD;
Whoa"t stan' still! You won't do that thing&#xD;
so easy again. There-now put ahead !" said&#xD;
Jack, recovering himself and reniountimg.&#xD;
lIe's on again, by mighty ! We'll, if he&#xD;
can stick on, he shall be welcome to him. I'll&#xD;
never own a hoss that'll let sick a scoundrel&#xD;
ride him."&#xD;
While Nick was speaking, Shagbark was&#xD;
proving that his training had not been invain.&#xD;
.tiaving made a few wild plunges forward, he&#xD;
mreared straight upon his hinder feet, made a&#xD;
splendid pirouette, dashed to the right, then&#xD;
to the left, and ended by throwing himself&#xD;
down, and rolling over. had not the horse-&#xD;
stealer beep very agile, he would not have&#xD;
escaped without 'broken bones. As it was, he&#xD;
sustained bruises of the flesh and abrasions of&#xD;
the skin.&#xD;
I'll never yield a p'it-if I can't ride ye,&#xD;
I'll lead ye !" exclaimed Jack, advancing to&#xD;
regain the end of the lariat, which trailed&#xD;
upon the ground. Shagbark, if not wise as a&#xD;
serpent, yet wise as his master could make&#xD;
him, now thoroughly in the mood of display-&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;
ing his qualities, suddenly turned tail upon&#xD;
his admirer, and planting both feet on his&#xD;
chest, knocked what breath out of him that&#xD;
happened to be in him at the time, and left&#xD;
him doubled up in the shape of a half-moon,&#xD;
on the plateau.- Had pot the force of those'&#xD;
retributive feet been nearly spent before they&#xD;
reached bim, Jack Wiley would have never&#xD;
thrown lariat over horse again.&#xD;
Nick Whiffles lay down in the grass, and&#xD;
enjoyed-one of those silent and smothered, yet&#xD;
satisfactory laughs, that sometimes come upon&#xD;
one almost irresistibly, whose outward expres-&#xD;
sion is impossible or unallowable.&#xD;
Shagbark having performed this feat, went&#xD;
caperingback to his grass, with the lariat trail-&#xD;
ing under his feet.&#xD;
After rolling about a while, like a man suf-&#xD;
fering the purgatorial pains'of bilious colic,&#xD;
Wileyarose, and with bent figure and muttered&#xD;
imprecations, started off across the country&#xD;
in the direction of Trapper Valley.&#xD;
" I wasn't greatly mistaken in his charac-&#xD;
ter,",soliloquized Nick, as he tracked Wiley&#xD;
on his devious way. " There's sunthin' inside&#xD;
of 'me that callers tells me when a nian can be&#xD;
trusted. I wonder what 'tis what tells people&#xD;
who is to be trusted and who isn't. I plucked&#xD;
him like a brand from the bnrnin', and I don't&#xD;
know that I'm sorry for it; I'n oi'y sorry&#xD;
that there's sich base ingratitude in tlhe world.&#xD;
But it don't trouble me-nothin' troubles inc.&#xD;
I take the world as I find it. .It's a good&#xD;
world, I allow, as good as the Master o''Life&#xD;
could make, for I know that he's so good and&#xD;
true that he'd made a better one if he could.&#xD;
There's bad folks in it-sartin, there's bad&#xD;
folks in it ; but all these things'll come right-&#xD;
in the course o' natur'. Wonder where lie's&#xD;
going' ?"&#xD;
As there was no one to answer the trapper s&#xD;
last interrogation, he was obliged to depend&#xD;
on himself for a suitable response; and after&#xD;
dogging him up hill and down through gully,&#xD;
ravine, and defile, he stood at last on the emi-&#xD;
nence overlooking Trapper Valley, while JaZik&#xD;
Wiley was making his way down the declivity&#xD;
toward Devil's Gate.&#xD;
'' He don't 'pear to be so much afeared o'&#xD;
the hopgobhns as lie was two or three hours&#xD;
ago," muttered Nicholas. " I think I'm on&#xD;
the track of them ,I've been lookin'" for. I'll&#xD;
git at the mystery at last-people callers gi&#xD;
at mysteries when they try. I'll just keep the&#xD;
gentleman iii sight. There isn't no harm in&#xD;

it may do a heap o' good. I must hurry, for&#xD;
it's near daylight ; and I don't b'hieve 'it's a&#xD;
safe place to explore when the sun is shinin'."&#xD;
The ground which the parties were now&#xD;
traversing was cut up and rendered danger-&#xD;
ous by yawning chasms; jagged rocks, rifts,&#xD;
and gulches. 'There were marks everywhere&#xD;

Nick smiled grimly; he derived melancholy&#xD;
s4tisthction from the conceit. He was still&#xD;
f4ll of his old quaintness--it was ready to flow&#xD;
out of the comical corners of his mouth, to&#xD;
twinkle at you from his genial eyes. Danger&#xD;
could not change the spirit that was in him ;&#xD;

:Brun arose and sat upon his haunches, his&#xD;
fote-feet hanging down like the flippers of a&#xD;
seal, while his back rested against the pillar of&#xD;
basalt. Nick would have retreated; but he&#xD;
stood, unfortunately, in the Devil's Gate, and&#xD;
could not safely go in any other direction than&#xD;
through the tunnel toward Trapper Valley-&#xD;
a locality he did not then care to visit. He&#xD;
maintained his post, keeping his eyes stead-&#xD;
ifl upon the bear. He cautiously cocked his&#xD;
rifle but did notpoint it, fearing to make any&#xD;
movement to further excite the ire and suspi-&#xD;
eibn of bruin.&#xD;
"I don't like to be stared at in that way, you&#xD;

Bruin now stood singularly erect, and&#xD;
took two steps toward Nicholas, who leveled&#xD;
his rifle.&#xD;
" Do that  'in, old boy, and you and I'll&#xD;
have a p'isondiikity, right off!'&#xD;
The ,bear did not stir, but stood up straight&#xD;
as a man. As the two confronted each other,&#xD;
the first glow of morning appeared in the&#xD;
west : and a few golden threads of light, the&#xD;
aaat-cereura of the coming sun, fell upon the&#xD;
&#xD;
columns, towers, and galls of the mimic city.&#xD;
The form of the bear sank to the earth, and&#xD;
the figure of a human being arose. Nick re-&#xD;
coiled against one of the columns of the moun-&#xD;
tain gate.&#xD;
" An Injin, I swear to gracious ! Who are&#xD;
ye, redskin? What you masqueradin' in that&#xD;
shape for? You'll git into diffikilty sometime&#xD;
in that wayI!"&#xD;
"Doubledark is brave. He does not fear&#xD;
the teeth of the bear, and walks with a big&#xD;
heart in the valley of the Thunder-Spirit !" r =-&#xD;
plied the figure that had uprisen from the skin&#xD;
of the bear.&#xD;
" It is Mult'nomah, chief of the Shoshonis !"&#xD;
exclaimed Nick. " Glad to see ve, though&#xD;
this is the last place of all the world where I&#xD;
should look for ye. Your people are not often&#xD;
found in this neighborhood, on account of the&#xD;
stories that are told, about what is seen and&#xD;
heard hereabouts."&#xD;
" There is a Manito dwells here that we&#xD;
must not offend !" answered Multnomah, look-&#xD;
ing searchingly at Nick. " The Shoshonis&#xD;
make war upon men, not upon spirits-tlie&#xD;
first can be seen and handled, the last are like&#xD;
the wind, invisible, and too fine for the touch&#xD;
of mortals. Doubledark believes in a Manito&#xD;
of the mountains ?"&#xD;
The Shoshoni, who had advanced and sha-&#xD;
ken hands-with the trapper, now regarded him&#xD;
with searching intensity. The question was&#xD;
intended to draw out infinitely more than it&#xD;
expressed. Nick became quaint in a moment&#xD;
--his eyes- said, plainly : "I am a pump ;&#xD;
work the handle, and out it comes." In fact&#xD;
the trapper thrust his right arm downward, in&#xD;
imitation of the arm of a pump.&#xD;
"Ever see one of 'em ?"&#xD;
" At Selkirk," said the Indian, with a smile.&#xD;
"Very good--fetch water-cool when it comes&#xD;
up. Wah! My brother is not a fool. He&#xD;
knows which way the buffalo goes by the track,&#xD;
he can tell when the winds will rush down the&#xD;
. mountains by the looks of the clouds, and he&#xD;
learns by the setting of the sun what the wea-&#xD;
ther will be to-morrow."-&#xD;
"Red brother,ryourwwords are sensible-&#xD;
they tickle the ears of Doubledark. I despise&#xD;
a fool, by mighty! Redskin, the air isn't good&#xD;
here-let us be walkin'."&#xD;
"No," said Multnomah, shaking his head ;&#xD;
"air bad-couldn't live here long.  Wal!&#xD;
Brother, why did you come in to such bad&#xD;
air ?"&#xD;
Nick had started off up the mountain side,&#xD;
but upon hearing this interrogatory, stopped&#xD;
short, and showed a wide, quizzical mouth to&#xD;
the Shoshone.&#xD;
"I went to see the Thunder-Spirit," he re-&#xD;
sponded.&#xD;
" Doubledark is too dark ! he does not deal&#xD;
openly with his brother-his thoughts are&#xD;
shut up. We cannot walk together."&#xD;
" Shoshone, there have been strange rumors&#xD;
&#xD;
I:&#xD;
&#xD;
PATHAWAY ; OR, THE MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
about Trapper Valley-they have reached my&#xD;
ears.- Is Mutnomali discreet ?"&#xD;
The Shoshon6 made i o reply. A scornful&#xD;
smile curled his lips.&#xD;
" I understand; it was ag'in the grain, and it&#xD;
wasn't right, I allow, to question the discreet-&#xD;
ness of a Shoshone chief. Give us your hand,&#xD;
redskin, and we'lL make a clean thing on't.&#xD;
There ain't many white men that can be trust-&#xD;
ed fully ; but I know the kind o' stuff you're&#xD;
made on. We've camped together many a&#xD;
night, Injin ; we've looked at the stars and the&#xD;
moon at the same time, and wondered how the&#xD;
sky come to be, and how long it had been.&#xD;
We've hunted in company, slept at the same&#xD;
fire, and eaten of the same buffaler off the same&#xD;
,piece o' bark, roasted over the same blaze, and&#xD;
on the same stick. Once, Injn, we starved to-&#xD;
gether, and feasted on half-starved dog at the&#xD;
eend of our fast. That was in the neighbor-&#xD;
hood of Beer Spring. We've trapped beaver&#xD;
on the Yellow Stone and at the headwaters of&#xD;
Salmon River, and never quarreled. And,&#xD;
speaking' of trappin', reminds me that I've lost&#xD;
traps hereabouts-at a place edlled Black&#xD;
Rock, and at Otter Creek, near the Red Sand-&#xD;
stone Cliffs."&#xD;
"Doubledark has lost traps. Is he the only&#xD;
one who has reason to complain? Have not&#xD;
others lost traps and peltries ? Is there not&#xD;
niore to be said, white man ?" answered Mult-&#xD;
nomah, with earnestness.&#xD;
"mNot on'y raps, bt them that set 'em-not&#xD;
on'y peltries but them that owned 'emh, have&#xD;
disappeared, and there's nobody to explain it."&#xD;
" The bad Monito is to blame, brother," said&#xD;
the Shoshon4.&#xD;
"Injin, neither you nor I believe in sick&#xD;
nonsense. The Thunder-Sperit would cease to&#xD;
be herd if you should quinch the volcanic&#xD;
fires that burn in the mountains. It isn't the&#xD;
sperits out the body that we have to -fear ; it's&#xD;
the sperits in the body that does the mischief.&#xD;
I've had more trouble with them I could see,&#xD;
than with them I couldn't. Redskin, my eyes&#xD;
have not been shet."&#xD;
"Isee that they have been open ; and I am&#xD;
glad."&#xD;
"Injin, I've been watchin' these mountains.&#xD;
They have dark secrets, if they'd on'y tell&#xD;
'em; but they are mute, and what we don't&#xD;
know we must l'arn for ouselves. There are&#xD;
them that walk up and down by night, and&#xD;
disappear in out-of-the-way places. They&#xD;
don't seem to be afraid of the bad Manito. No&#xD;
one that sees 'em knows where they come from,&#xD;
where the go to, or what their business is."&#xD;
"Now, Doubledark is not dark ; he speaks&#xD;
plainly to his friends. Are they white^ or&#xD;
red:?"&#xD;
"Injin, Nick Whiffles is a man of truth;&#xD;
his talk is not crooked. Their skins is white,&#xD;
but their hearts is black. I'm sorry to say it,&#xD;
by gracious; but so it is, and there's no gettin'&#xD;
round it."&#xD;
" There are bad men among all nations.&#xD;
&#xD;
23&#xD;
&#xD;
There are red men whose ways are not straight.&#xD;
The bad white men inhabit the mountain of&#xD;
rocks and the valley below. This iq why you&#xD;
found the Shoshone in disguised"&#xD;
" Your purpose- was the same as mine, I&#xD;
reckon. You wanted to look into the myste-&#xD;
ries of the valley, as 'twere, and see what you&#xD;
could see. The critter you call Doubledark&#xD;
was there on the same arrand. What's the use&#xD;
o' minmc' matters, Injin  There's a set o'&#xD;

"But the Thunder-Spirit I" queried Mult-&#xD;
nomah.&#xD;
"May go to thunder 1" retorted Nick,,em-&#xD;
phatically.&#xD;
"Doubledark, the Great Spirit, willed that&#xD;
we should meet; he wills everything-men, as&#xD;
well as the clouds and the rain. He said :&#xD;
'To-night the pale-face and red-face shall meet,&#xD;
and speak truly to each other.' It is good&#xD;
that bad men s ould be punished., You see&#xD;
this bear-skin ?" The Shoshone had rolled up&#xD;
the skin, and fastened it to his back. "In it&#xD;
I have prowled among the rocks, and seen men&#xD;
go in and out at the dark gate. To-night,&#xD;
something seemed to tell me to enter, and seek&#xD;
out these bad spirits."&#xD;
".What did you see ?" demanded Nick.&#xD;
"1I saw the hot-spring throwing up water&#xD;
and smoke."-1&#xD;
" Whatelse ? I observed that myself and&#xD;
don't feel much wiser for it.&#xD;
"I went a long way among    at masses of&#xD;
rocks, that the Great Spirit had hurled down&#xD;
from the mountains in his anger, or broken u&#xD;
from the foundations of the valley. Then&#xD;
came to running water,-that whirled and eddied&#xD;
among the ledges, and passed out of sight in&#xD;
a black abyss. Afterward, I crossed a gulch,&#xD;
and found a,spot where the grass grew, and the&#xD;
wormwood was rank and tangled, supported&#xD;
by the wash of the mountains in the ryiny&#xD;
seasons. Beyond this were trees-some old,&#xD;
and gnarled, and twisted ; others dwarfed, and&#xD;
wounded by the descent of rocks from the&#xD;
cliffs above. Multnomah paused on the, m r-&#xD;

"d    's Very dirt there-like the silent pas-&#xD;

little strip of the sky. If a Shoshone could&#xD;

Fo time he 'stood still, and thought of all&#xD;
the tales he had heard-of the valley. He tried&#xD;
to hear the voice of his friendly Manito, telling&#xD;
hir what to do. Then there was the sound of&#xD;
steps ; And he laid down upon the earth, and&#xD;
saw people of your nation. They looked like&#xD;
free trappers. Their beards were long ; their&#xD;
hair hung upon their shoulders"; 'their belts&#xD;
were heavy with knives and pistols, and they&#xD;
walked with a -swaggering gait, like the red&#xD;
smi, when his heart has grown big with fire&#xD;
water. They drove along before then a man&#xD;
and a woman. The man was Pontneuf, a Ca-&#xD;
nadian voyageur; the woman was his daughter,&#xD;
very young, 'and:fair as the new moon. The&#xD;
hahda of Portneuf were bound, and his head&#xD;

CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
'a CANON.&#xD;
The gray hunter slept, unconscious of the&#xD;
e't of Jaak and 'Nick. His sleep was trou-&#xD;
bled.- The exciting, scene through which, he&#xD;
had recently passed gave a -coloring to his&#xD;
dreams. Bill 'debe,,Ben Joice,'and Zene Beck&#xD;
had a place in his thoughts, and harassed him&#xD;
for a long time ; then 'he slumbered more&#xD;
peacefully. 'Anon, his lips moved ;. his coun-&#xD;
tenance assumed a differentexpressiohn-softer,&#xD;
milder, more earnest.  The burden of his&#xD;
dream had changed.' It seemed to him that a&#xD;
gentle hand touched his forehead ; that a fair&#xD;
face'bent over him; that bright eyes beamed&#xD;
abovehim like love's tender:starlight.&#xD;
"Una! Una !" lie cried, springing to his&#xD;
feet, and stretching forth ihas arms in a trans.&#xD;
port of emotion.   This action thoroughly&#xD;
awakened him. He panted, clasped his brow&#xD;
with both hands';. then,'looking about, saw the&#xD;
boy sleeping tranquilly' in' his scarlet blanket.&#xD;
"I clasp-what is.it that I clasp?&#xD;
No breathing fromwithin my grasp&#xD;
*   * -   *     *   *   *&#xD;
And art thoui, dearest, changed so much,&#xD;
As ajeet my eye, yet mock my touch ?"&#xD;
he murmured. Then, recollecting himself, he&#xD;
added:&#xD;
" These vagaries are a shame upon my man-&#xD;
hood I Time should have taught me resigna-&#xD;
tion. Pshaw ! I am weaker than yonder boy."&#xD;
He sat down' upon his couch, supporting his&#xD;
head with his'hands, and appeared to plunge&#xD;
into a world of abstraction, where, doubtless,&#xD;
he found remembered landmarks, and scattered&#xD;
mementos of past joys and sorrows.&#xD;

PATHAWAY ; OR, THE:&#xD;
Sebastian opened his eyes, and looked at&#xD;
him timidly. The youth must have been cold,&#xD;
for a shiver ran over him, which was followed&#xD;
by a trembling of his whole frame. His&#xD;
cheeks were burning red, while his eyes shone&#xD;
unnaturally bright. He did not close them&#xD;
again till morning'; but, remaining wakeful,&#xD;
continued to observe the movements of the&#xD;
gray hunter. Possibly, the lad was afraid ;&#xD;
but the two dogs lay at his feet, and their&#xD;
strength and sagacity were no mean protection,&#xD;
even against greater odds.&#xD;
When the sun streamed its rays into the hut,&#xD;
Sebastian arose, and was passing out, when&#xD;
Pathway, starting from his reverie, addressed&#xD;
him:&#xD;
"1Have you slept well, my lad? Your nerves&#xD;
are not strong, I think ?"&#xD;
"1I did not dream ; the sleep that is without&#xD;
dreams is the sweetest, I've heard," answered&#xD;
Sebastian, carelessly.&#xD;
"Dreams ?" repeated Pathaway, coloring.&#xD;
Then, with a smile : "You are right, my boy,;&#xD;
dreamless slumber is best. Dreams are unin-&#xD;
vited guests, that intrude *upon harassed&#xD;
minds."&#xD;
Sebastian stood in the door of the hut ; the&#xD;
sunshine fell like gold upon his face and hair.&#xD;
" He might pass for an Anchises or Adon-&#xD;
nis," murmured Pathaway. "What is your&#xD;
name, youth ?" he added.&#xD;
"Sebastian Delaunay," returned the boy,&#xD;
indifferently.&#xD;
"Was your mother handsome, boy ?"&#xD;
Sebastian smiled ; and his brown cheeks&#xD;
took a deeper color.&#xD;
"Her face was darker than mine ; her- hair&#xD;
was long and black ; her eyes large and&#xD;
dreamy. To me, hunter, she was beautiful,&#xD;
though she was a dweller in lodges and wig-&#xD;
wams."&#xD;
" But your father-"&#xD;
" Had a. skin like yours," interrupted Se-&#xD;
bastinn, turning his back to his interrogator,&#xD;
as if tired of the subject.-&#xD;
"'You have your mother's voice, lad, I&#xD;
should say."&#xD;
Sebastian beat upon the ground with his'&#xD;
moccasined foot.&#xD;
" You called the honest trapper 'uncle,' if&#xD;
I remember rightly ?"&#xD;
"I called him uncle," said Sebastian, lacon-&#xD;
ically-then walked from the hut.&#xD;
He was gone a considerable time, and,&#xD;
when lie returned, found Pathaway standing&#xD;
at the door.&#xD;
"1Where is my entertainer?  I have looked&#xD;
for him in vain," he said, as Sebastian ap-&#xD;
proached.&#xD;
"He left in the night to follow the fellow&#xD;
Wiley, I suspect. I shall be anxious about&#xD;
him if he does not come back soon ; but lie is&#xD;
wise, and can take care of himself."&#xD;
The youth paused, and uttered an exclama-&#xD;
tion of terror. Pathaway looked up,-and saw&#xD;
&#xD;
3&#xD;
&#xD;
MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS.                     27&#xD;
Nick coming, with a grizzly bear walking qui-&#xD;
etly beside him.- Both Sebastian and the&#xD;
hunter felt an inclination to retire into the&#xD;
hut.&#xD;
"0 uncle Nick ! do not come near with&#xD;
that frightful beast," cried Sebastian.&#xD;
" Don't be afeard ; I've magnetized the&#xD;
critter, and got him under subjection. Cu-&#xD;
r'ous, isn't it, what power there is in the&#xD;
will? Wouldn't believed it, 'less I'd seen it&#xD;
done. Howsomnever, he'd been tamed some&#xD;
afore I got him. Bought him of an Injii ;&#xD;
and he's got some queer tricks, I allow  I&#xD;
can make him stan' up on his hind legs e'ena-&#xD;
most as straight as a man-shake hands with&#xD;
his fore-paws-tell the time o' day by the sun&#xD;
-run, trot, or gallop-lay down or -git up-&#xD;
and do anything that a dog can !"&#xD;
".Keep him at a proper distance," said&#xD;
Pathaway ; " for I never was partial to that&#xD;
kind of animal."&#xD;
Sebastian ran into the but for his bow, and&#xD;
came out with n arrow upon his string.&#xD;
' Up, you p'son critter, on to your hind&#xD;
legs, and let's dance the war-dance together!"&#xD;
said Nick, beginning to chant, in a monotonous&#xD;
manner, an Indian scalp-dance.  The bear&#xD;
reared ; and, standing quite erect, danced, in&#xD;
time and tune, with ludicrous gravity. The&#xD;
gray hunter and the youth laughed in con-&#xD;
cert.&#xD;
"A wonderful bear, truly S" remarked&#xD;
Pathaway.&#xD;
" Hunter, nothin' of the common kind&#xD;
comes up to my idee. You mightn't think it,&#xD;
but he can be trusted as well as any dog-not&#xD;
exceptin' Misfortin and Smuggler, who are the&#xD;
most knowin'est speciments of their race.&#xD;
He'll be good company for Sebastian when I&#xD;
go to look arter my traps."&#xD;
The boy shook his head, and looked star-&#xD;
tled at this announcement.&#xD;
"I like the dogs much better, Nicholas,"&#xD;
he replied.&#xD;
"The- dogs are extr'ordiner in their line ;&#xD;
but they haven't the sagacity of this 'ere bruin.&#xD;
Sa, bow-wow, you shaggy animile."&#xD;
he bear growled, very much like the copy&#xD;
Nick had set him.&#xD;
" There ! that's enough for this time," said&#xD;
Nicholas. "fLay down, and be quiet. Mis-&#xD;
fortin, stop barkin'; Smuggler,. straighten&#xD;
your back down, and be .civil to strangers.&#xD;
You don't have sich distinguished company&#xD;
every day."&#xD;
"Give him something to eat," said Patha-&#xD;
way, with a quiet-laugh.&#xD;
"I He devoured half a buffaler cow not&#xD;
ten minutes ago. If you's to offer him the ni-&#xD;
cest slice ever cut from a sirline, lie wouldn't&#xD;
so much as turn it over with his nose. Come&#xD;
away, dogs, and don't tamper with him; for&#xD;
his temper isn't alleys even.-Now, stranger, I&#xD;

duties o' hospitality."-&#xD;

Pathaway perceived that the leader of these&#xD;
wild and uncouth men exercised a strong as-&#xD;
cendency over them. His word was law-his&#xD;
will paramount. The combatants separated&#xD;
sullenly, without disputing his authority. By&#xD;
his order, the pack of peltries was carried up&#xD;
among the rocks, by two of his fellows.&#xD;
"4You and Ben are at your old tricks again,"&#xD;
said the captain, addressing Zene Beck. "You&#xD;
can't be quiet, and do mischief only when&#xD;
you're told. There's been a little too much o&#xD;
this lately ; and the trappers and Ingins are&#xD;
talkin' about Trapper Valley, and the whole&#xD;
country hereabouts. This body musn't be&#xD;
left here exposed ; it '11 be found, and then&#xD;
there'll be more surmises and rumors afloat&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
Find a convenient place, some of ye, and bury&#xD;
him."&#xD;
Instantly, several men set off in different&#xD;
directions, and Boon discovered a suitable spot&#xD;
for their purpose; it was a deep hollow, at the&#xD;
bottom of a gulch, which intersected the canon&#xD;
at right angles, and'not far from Pathaway.&#xD;
The body of the unfortunate trapper was&#xD;
dragged to the gulch.&#xD;
"He's got done with that huntin'-shirt., I&#xD;
reckon 1" said an ill-clad fellow. "Wat good&#xD;
'11 it do him, if we put him to bed with it on?'&#xD;
The body was instantly despoiled of the&#xD;
coveted garment, and then thrown into the&#xD;
hollow. Pathaway, by creeping a few yards,&#xD;
was able to see these movements, and to hear&#xD;
the conversation of the outlaws.  Feelings&#xD;
mournfully unpleasant crowded upon him ; he.&#xD;
was affected, he knew not why. ie felt a sin-&#xD;
glar sympathy for the victim of this wrong.&#xD;
u obtained a casual glimpse of the face as&#xD;
they cast him into his rough grave. The fea-&#xD;
tures, hie thought, were placid, like one sleep-&#xD;
irg, and without the usual painful expression&#xD;
attendant upon death by gunshot wounds.&#xD;
The hollow was a depression between two&#xD;
ledges of red sand-stone, some eight feet in&#xD;
length, and three and a half in depth. One&#xD;
of the men cut some boughs from a pinon with&#xD;
his hatchet ; while another, with lessgentle-&#xD;
ness, east upon these some flat rocks and frag-&#xD;
meats of a decayed tree. Just over the place&#xD;
of sepulchre, the earth upon the steep wall4f&#xD;
the canon was loose, and the grim undertakers&#xD;
scratched it down upon the trapper. Present-&#xD;
ly, the grave was filled, the burial complete:&#xD;
It appeared an ill way of dying, a melafr1&#xD;
holy end to a merry life; but a lingering&#xD;
death by disease, a wasting consumption, or a&#xD;
loathsome epidemic, are really things more&#xD;
dreadful. Pathaway's sympathies increased ;&#xD;
a nervous excitement stole over him. The&#xD;
few moments consumed in covering the mur-&#xD;
dered man with earth were to him intolerably&#xD;
long. Indignation and a terrible fever of imi-&#xD;
patience preyed upon him. Every bough, and&#xD;
rock, and.handful of earth that they cast 'on&#xD;
him, seemed.pressing upon his own breasi~ in&#xD;
vain, he attempted to quell his over-tive&#xD;
sensibilities ; in vain, he recalled the traigseal&#xD;
scenes he had witnessed on the prairies, and in&#xD;
the recesses of the ranges ; he derived no con-&#xD;
solation and fortitude from  the same. He&#xD;
pressed his lheated forehead to the ground, to&#xD;
cool it, and, closing his eyes, resolved not to&#xD;
look again. In that position lie remained sone&#xD;
time. Then he glanced down the gulch again.&#xD;
It was empty; but there was the trapper's&#xD;
grave, with that sickly, warning freshness u porn&#xD;
it that always attaches to the newly-raised&#xD;
f mound, and impresses one with mournfulness&#xD;
unspeakable, especially when it is heaped over&#xD;
our beloved. Ahl the fresh earth over a grave&#xD;
says so plainly: "Man, you are mortal I"&#xD;
Pathaway looked anxiously down the canon,&#xD;
and saw the outlaws filing off to the Tight,&#xD;
&#xD;

so&#xD;
&#xD;
PATHAWAY ; OR,. THE MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
through a narrow defile, the hindmost stagger-&#xD;
ing beneath the weight of the dead trapper's&#xD;
peltries. The gray hunter darted down into&#xD;
the gulch, and, with his naked hands, began to&#xD;
dig the earth from the body. A frantic zeal,&#xD;
a terrible haste marked his movements. He&#xD;
labored like one upon whose efforts depended&#xD;
the matter of life and death. His face was&#xD;
pale, his lips compressed, and perspiration&#xD;
poured from his brow. A person, coming upon&#xD;
im suddenly while thus employed, would have&#xD;
pronounced him mad.                     .&#xD;
He scattered the earth ; he hurled away the&#xD;
stones ; he cast out the boughs and rotten&#xD;
fragments of wood, and, grasping the body by&#xD;
the shoulders, dragged it, with herculean&#xD;
strength, from beneath the mass that yet re-&#xD;
mained. Panting, he paused, glancing hur-&#xD;
riedly about for water ; he saw a small stream&#xD;
trickling down into the gulch above. He&#xD;
seized the unconscious form, and carried it&#xD;
there. He placed his hand upon the trapper's&#xD;
heart; it beat--he lived!i He held hishead&#xD;
under the descending rivulet, and let it fall&#xD;
upon his face, which was covered with earth,&#xD;
disfiguring every feature. The dash of the&#xD;
water upon him made him gasp, and brought&#xD;
back a portion of latent life. Pathaway&#xD;
cleansed the dirt from his wound. 'The ball&#xD;
had struck his head, near the occipital bone,&#xD;
and glanced along the skull, benumbing and&#xD;
suspending, for the time, all the functions of&#xD;
life. He had sustained other injuries upon&#xD;
various portions of his person, from the rocks&#xD;
that were thrown upon him ; but Pathaway&#xD;
doubted not that he possessed sufficient vi-&#xD;
tality ultimately to recover.&#xD;
The man's beard was quite long and heavy,&#xD;
but he was much younger than the gray hunter&#xD;
had at first thought. He judged that he was&#xD;
about twenty-eight,- or maybe younger. His&#xD;
features were strongly marked, and his frame&#xD;
gave every indication of manlyhardihood. A&#xD;
nearer view certainlygave Pathaway a more fa-&#xD;
vorable impression of the man, increasing, also,'&#xD;
that strange interest that had urged him to&#xD;
such efforts for his resurrection and resuscita-&#xD;
tion. He did not relax his exertions. Wiping&#xD;
his soiled lips and beard, he poured some&#xD;
spirit into his mouth from his flask. The&#xD;
trapper's blood felt the grateful stimulant, and&#xD;
revtved. His chest heaved ; and he moved his&#xD;
limbs, opened his eyes, and sat up.&#xD;
"How do you feel? Ain you not better ?"&#xD;
asked Pathaway, gently.&#xD;
.The man looked at him vacantly ; there&#xD;
was no soul, no language, no comprehension, in&#xD;
those orbs.&#xD;
" The concussion has affected his brain ; his&#xD;
mind is absent," muttered Pathaway, and un-&#xD;
consciously put his hand to his own head, as&#xD;
if the wound was there. He then resumed his&#xD;
friendly ministrations ; but though the young&#xD;
trapper evidently gained strength, no ray of&#xD;
intelligence returned to illuminate his dull&#xD;
face. Pathaway took off his own frock, and&#xD;
&#xD;
V.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
put it on him, and assisted him to arise. He&#xD;
could stand without difficulty, but wanted that&#xD;
reason which was necessary to guide his foot-&#xD;
steps across mountains and prairies, as hereto-&#xD;
fore.&#xD;
The spectacle of his helplessness made the&#xD;
gray hunter inexpressibly sad. He tried every&#xD;
artifice to awaken his memory and arouse his&#xD;
intellect, but without success. He elicited only&#xD;
an idiotic stare or a childish smile.&#xD;
" Poor fellow ! poor fellow ! I trust this will&#xD;
be but temporary. What shall I do with him?&#xD;
Providence has cast him upon-me, and I'll take&#xD;
care of him. Yes, it was Providence that filled&#xD;
me with such a fury of zeal to unearth him, and&#xD;
save him from his horrible entombment. We&#xD;
are watched over, even in the wilderness."&#xD;
Pathaway led the trapper to a sheltered&#xD;
spot, and making him a couch of boughs upon&#xD;
the soft grass, laid him upon it, and spread his&#xD;
own blanket over him; then sitting by his side,&#xD;
watched him till he fell into a heavy sleep.&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
THE WOUNDED TRAPPER FINDS FRIENDS.&#xD;
Pathaway awoke the wounded man at the&#xD;
expiration of two hours. He had but little&#xD;
fever, while his strength was not greatly im-&#xD;
paired by his injuries. His benefactor killed a&#xD;
prairie-chicken, and, roasting it, gave him such&#xD;
portions as were tender and palatable, and least&#xD;
iely to disturb the system. He obeyed the&#xD;
hunter with the docility of a child, but gave&#xD;
no indications- of returning reason. The hem-&#xD;
horrage from his wound had been slight ; but a&#xD;
closer examination showed a deep indentation&#xD;
in the skull, which convinced Pathdway that&#xD;
he could be no better, in a mental point of&#xD;
view, without the aid of skillful surgery. , He&#xD;
reared a temporary shelter, and passed the&#xD;
long night \with his patient, watching every&#xD;
symptom, and doing everything.that hislimited&#xD;
means would allow for his comfort.&#xD;
In the morning, still less fever remained, and&#xD;
Pathaway determined to return with him, by&#xD;
easy stages, to Nick Whifues' hut. He walked&#xD;
very well. The birds and the sunshine pleased&#xD;
him ; he heard with delight the songs of the&#xD;
feathered choristers, and smiled when the&#xD;
golden rays, warm and sportive, fell upon his&#xD;
face. He muttered about rivers and moun-&#xD;
tains, lakes and prairies, trappers and peltries ;&#xD;
but there was no coherency in his wandering&#xD;
fancies. Pathaway called his attention to the&#xD;
lake as they passed it; he-stretched out his&#xD;
hands, and manifested a momentary inter-&#xD;
est, but it was evanescent as smoke.  He next&#xD;
pointed to the timber, but with no better re-&#xD;
sults. Despairing of drawing forth any signs&#xD;
of intelligence, Pathaway pursued the way&#xD;
toward Nick's hut, in a frame of mind far&#xD;
from cheerful. It was past noon when lie&#xD;
reached it ; and his disappointment was great&#xD;
on finding it deserted. There it stood, bare&#xD;
and inhospitable ; there was no one at the door&#xD;
to give him a welcome, or light the friendly&#xD;

PATIIAWAY ; OR, THE:&#xD;
cam p-fire. Nick had changed his quarters ; for&#xD;
the free trapper, in dangerous neighborhoods,.&#xD;
seldom camps many days in the same place,&#xD;
and sometimes is compelled to seek. a new&#xD;
camping-ground nightly.&#xD;
Pathaway picked up a piece of birch bark&#xD;
in the hut, with unique characters printed&#xD;
upon it with charcoal, in crooked capitals :&#xD;
GONE TO THE NOR TH. SEED SIGNS&#xD;
OF A PISON DIFFIKILTY.&#xD;
The execution of this rather vague an-&#xD;
nouncement was such that Pathaway could&#xD;
not repress a smile. Nick's early education&#xD;
had clearly been of a hurried and imperfect&#xD;
kind, which fact was sufficiently attested by&#xD;
the zig-zag cut of his letters, and the-pecu-&#xD;
liarity of his spelling. It was too late in the&#xD;
day, and the wounded man was too much fa-&#xD;
tigued for a new tramp, based upon instruc-&#xD;
tions so meagre ; so the gray hunter made&#xD;
preparations to remain there till the next day.&#xD;
While he was thus employed, he heard the&#xD;
baying of a dog, and looking out, saw Nick&#xD;
approaching through the cottonwoods, mount-&#xD;
ed, and attended by one of his dogs. It was&#xD;
a pleasant surprise.&#xD;
"I forgot somethin', and cote back arter&#xD;
it," said the trapper, "and it's licky I did,&#xD;
prehaps. Got back sooner'n you expected, I&#xD;
reckon. Hillo ! who ye got there-one of gur&#xD;
kind, I s'pose ?"&#xD;
Nick dismounted, shook hands with Path-&#xD;
away, then turning to the wounded trapper,&#xD;
said:&#xD;
" How'd 'e do, stranger ? You're welcome&#xD;
to my but ; and 'tisn't mine, either, 'cause I&#xD;
desarted it ; but you're safe here, and not al-&#xD;
together safe, neither ; for there's a pesky&#xD;
sight of danger hereabouts from both red and&#xD;
white."&#xD;
"4Mountains, beavers, otters, traps, and&#xD;
lakes !" said the wounded trapper, with a&#xD;
meaningless stare.                    '&#xD;
"Jes' so, brother--jes' so ! That's clear&#xD;
Ingin, and not so clear,"arter all. Been out&#xD;
on your own hook, I allow ?" returned Nick,&#xD;
with a puzzled look.&#xD;
Horses, halters, and horse-stealers !" mut-&#xD;
tered the trapper, latlessly.&#xD;
"'Zaetly, mister ; it's all right, I'll be&#xD;
bound, though I can't see the drift on't, by&#xD;
mighty. Howsomnever, if you're disposed to&#xD;
make gamut of me, I don't keer no great&#xD;
about it, for they've had me in.the newspapers&#xD;
down in the clearin's, and done a heavy busi-&#xD;
ness with me in that line. I say, Pathaway,&#xD;
what's the matter with the feller's eyes ? His&#xD;
face has a gone-away look, I allow."&#xD;
" He has fallen among thieves," responded&#xD;
the gray hunter. He was shot at and robbed&#xD;
in a canon."-&#xD;
Pathaway related circumstantially the facts&#xD;
of the ease, to which Nick listened with much&#xD;
interest.-&#xD;
"It's a cruel thing," he.said, shaking his&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS.                       31&#xD;
head, " to rob the honest trapper of his hard-&#xD;
earned gains ; but when murder is added to&#xD;
robbery, it becomes a terrible thing. So this&#xD;
poor critter has lost the light o' reason. It's&#xD;
a mournful spettakle to be an idiot, and that&#xD;
isn't jest the tarm, either ; but you know&#xD;
what I mean, which makes it all the same.&#xD;
Honest men allers understan' each other,&#xD;
though the words mayn't all be fitted into&#xD;
place like the bricks in a buildin'. I had a&#xD;
relation that was a fool. And sich a fool as&#xD;
he was !  0 Lord, yesI   He cried himself&#xD;
to death for the moon ; but what he thought&#xD;
it was, and what he wanted to do with it; I&#xD;
dunno, by mighty ! _ Perhaps he 'magined&#xD;
'twas sunthin' to eat ; I dare say !" added&#xD;
Nick, reflectively, unconsciously lowering his&#xD;
voice, "the poor, vacant critter thought 'twas&#xD;
sunthin' to eat. An idiot, you know, loves&#xD;
eating' better nor a wise man does his sweet-&#xD;
heart."&#xD;
The wounded man started, smiled sadly,,&#xD;
then sang, in a voice inexpressibly plaintive,&#xD;
the following words:     .&#xD;
" My sweetheart was a prairie-flower-&#xD;
She dwelt beside the flowing water ;&#xD;
I stole by moonlight to her bower-&#xD;
-'I loved a wandering trapper's daughter.&#xD;
Oh, the trapper's daughter !&#xD;
- Her eyes were like soft star-beams gleaming,&#xD;
Her mouth was small, her lips were sweet,&#xD;
Her face was ever on me beaming-&#xD;
I fell, and worshiped at her feet.&#xD;
Oh, the trapper's daughter !"&#xD;
The poor fellow sang these simple words&#xD;
with touching sweetness.&#xD;
"The words sound nat'ral and sensible," ob-&#xD;
served Nick, " but he hasn't got back yet.&#xD;
It's mechanical; his mind has no mQ p-t- do&#xD;
with it than the fiddle has to do with tnakin'&#xD;
the music, when-it's' in the hands of a skillful&#xD;
player. He's been in love, it 'pears, which&#xD;
took hold on him powerful. Doctor Whiffles&#xD;
had a case on't that nullified all his doctor-&#xD;
stuff. 'Twas a woman~ and the case was of&#xD;
three years' stannin', which made it--what&#xD;
the fakilWt call--chronic. She lost a heap o'&#xD;
flesh, and. in fack, parted with nighabout all&#xD;
on't. She kept herself so wet up with cryin',&#xD;
that she had to be wrung out every day as&#xD;
reg'lar as sunrise. Her sobs was like the&#xD;
soughin' of the wind through the defiles in&#xD;
the mountains when there's a tempest. She&#xD;
sung sich tetchin' ditties, that sev'ral of her&#xD;
sisters was so melted that they never was&#xD;
worth much arterwards. To cure her, the&#xD;
doctor was obleeged to marry her himself.&#xD;
'Twas amiazin' how she picked up her crumbs&#xD;
arter that. She weighed two hunderd pounds&#xD;
and up'ards the last time I seed her. To look&#xD;
at her, you'd never knowed that her heart&#xD;
had been broke."&#xD;
"'Oh, the trapper's daughter--&#xD;
Oh, the trapper's daughter !"&#xD;
sang the wounded man, catching up the cho-&#xD;
rus of his song, and prolonging it with his&#xD;
strangely melancholy intonations.&#xD;

&#xD;
"iThat makes me feel bad, I swear to graci-&#xD;
ous !"~ Then to Pathaway, with emphasis, and&#xD;
gesticulating with his right haud : "This can't&#xD;
go on; it must and shall be stopped! These&#xD;
mountain robbers have had their way long&#xD;
enough.   Nobody's safe-I a'n't, you a'n't,&#xD;
and he isn't. We can't tell when, our turn'll&#xD;
come. We may be shot down like bufferler&#xD;
in the fust pass we comic to."&#xD;
"You say truly," answered Pathaway, ear-&#xD;
nestly. " These outrages must cease. This&#xD;
man's misfortune appeals to me witli irresist-&#xD;
ible . power ; it strengthens a purpose by no&#xD;
means new. . The mysterious baniditti of&#xD;
Trapper Valley must be traced to their ken.&#xD;
nel,-and made. to feel that they cannot coin-&#xD;
mit crime with- impunity, even in the wilder-&#xD;

" They're too liy to work like 'honest trap-&#xD;
persand hunters.,: They scorn the slow pro-&#xD;
cess of trappin' beaver and otter, choosin' to&#xD;
pounce upon the hard-eirne4 gains of others,&#xD;
rather than encounter the dangers and toils of&#xD;
the reg'lar business. But see ! lie's flushin'&#xD;
-up. The worrinieit of walkin', together with&#xD;
his wound and other injuries, has produced&#xD;
fever, which mustn't be neglected. We'll put&#xD;
him on to Shagbark, and be off."&#xD;
" Shagbark ?" repeated Pathaway, inquir-&#xD;
ingly.I&#xD;
"1This fine animile !" responded Nick, strok-&#xD;
ing - his horse's mane. " He's cfried me&#xD;
through thick and thin, and he'll carry him.&#xD;
For speed, nothin' can tetch him. ' Wouldn't&#xD;
'magine it, would ye ? Notice thera legs-&#xD;
look like pipe-stems, but they're powerful&#xD;
strong, and move like drumsticks when you&#xD;

to mount. That's. it--quite strong, a'n't ye ?'&#xD;
Now, take the reins-rail right  Now, we'll'&#xD;
toddle along nicely."&#xD;
The trapper, after being assisted to the&#xD;
saddle, was visibly; pleased with the change.&#xD;
It revived, for the:intant, old recollections.&#xD;
"Horses and running water, green grass&#xD;
and trees, prairies and !buffaloes. Bring up&#xD;
the peltries. Where's the pistols ? Takce care&#xD;
of the chasms there !" he muttered, then&#xD;
looked wishfully at Nick, who replied, sooth-&#xD;
ingly :&#xD;
SiEverything's jest as you want it. hold&#xD;
on fast, and I'll- lead the hoss---and IT won't&#xD;
lead him, neither, for'he'll foller me-like a&#xD;
.-o saying, Nicholas led the way, while Path-&#xD;
away walked beside the trapper, to steady him&#xD;
if his strength failed.,&#xD;
Shagbark manifested great sagacity in going&#xD;
down steep declivities and up rough ascent s;&#xD;
never stumbling or making a misstep. If his&#xD;
master-unconsciously got too far in advance,&#xD;
lie admonished him of the fact by a low whin-&#xD;
ny. As they went along, they saw a grizzly&#xD;
&#xD;
bear perched upon a cliff, looking down upon&#xD;
them. They passed beneath him unmolested,&#xD;
while Smuggler, instead of manifesting fear&#xD;
or a disposition to worry him, trotted quietly&#xD;
along'at Nick's heels.' =Path way scrutinized&#xD;
it sharply, but made no remark. To meet&#xD;
Brinain that country was not an uncommon&#xD;
occurrence, yet there'was something peculiar&#xD;
in the fixed position of this one. Pathaway&#xD;
grew more thoughtful; his gaze wandered&#xD;
oftener to his guide-he was begirming to see&#xD;
tn its, in 'the man worthy of study, and which&#xD;
were fast awakening interest and curiosity.&#xD;
Glancing backward for a parting view of the&#xD;
bear, he saw   hio .clambering over dizzy&#xD;
heights and close to the brinks of precipices.&#xD;
Had, Nick been near enough, the gray hunter&#xD;
would probably have called his notice to the&#xD;
cool 'audacity of the animal, which kept in&#xD;
sight till they reached the place of their des-&#xD;
tination, and were greeted by the great voice'of&#xD;
Misfortuneand the pleasanter one of Sebas-&#xD;
tian, who, having heard the story of the&#xD;
wounded trapper's calamity, manifested an&#xD;
amiable disposition to render his condition as&#xD;
comfortable as possible.  If the, youth had&#xD;
never'before shown address and quickness, in&#xD;
Pathaway's estimation he now manifested those&#xD;
qualities.  c performed things' so deftly-&#xD;
his touch toothed the couch of the unfor-&#xD;
tunate so adroitly, and with such earnest good-&#xD;
will and sympathy.&#xD;
" The bpy'il do for him almost as well's a&#xD;
woman," said'Nick, with pride. -"I've trained&#xD;
him to be reg'lar 'handy about the camp.&#xD;
Sich cooking' as: he'll do, and out o' iyothin,&#xD;
neither, and not nothin' either, 'cause it's gin-&#xD;
er'ly bufferler 'and other things, and not so&#xD;
much other things as bufferler. It's a knack ;&#xD;
some folks has knacks And some hasn't. Jes'&#xD;
give him a little salt and a perarie-chicken,&#xD;
and he'll nake a dish fit for "a president or a&#xD;
sick ian ; and 'tisu't a dish, neither, for we&#xD;
hia'n't got a dish, by mighty. .Don't own no-&#xD;
thin' in the.housekeepin' line but a stew-pan&#xD;
and a camp-kittle. But that'senough for him;&#xD;
he'd make 'a turkle-soup in a piece o' birch-&#xD;
bark if he on'y had the turkle. Don't foller&#xD;
his legs round quite so sharp, stranger, 'cause&#xD;
lie's iuther modest, and 'll think sunthin's the&#xD;
matter of 'em."&#xD;
"You seem   to be very fond of him, my&#xD;
friend !" observed Pathaway, noticing the ad-&#xD;
miring glances lie threw upon the boy.&#xD;
'Yes, in part, in part !" quoth Nick, in a&#xD;
matter-of-fact manner, "and not so much iii&#xD;
part as. in other ways. Then," he added, par-&#xD;
saigiit his former train of thought, "there's a&#xD;
brile--you never see sich a boy for a brile."&#xD;
The subject of these encpmimnis was seen to&#xD;
avert his ace, ad .Pathaway thought he&#xD;
ighed. Peralpsie overheard the flattering&#xD;
things his friend was saying of him.&#xD;
' File's so like my step-mother, who used to&#xD;
'irile, and stew, and roast, and finally briled,&#xD;
stewed, and roasted herself. into her grave.&#xD;

He can shoot an arrer, can Sebastian. He&#xD;
can hit an objeck of consider'ble magnitude&#xD;
at a short distance. He strikes a beautiful at-&#xD;
titude when he shoots ; there's a good 'cal in&#xD;
that, you know, for it brings out the nat'ral'&#xD;
cemetary of the systum-also of the legs."&#xD;
" The man ,has considerable fever, Uncle&#xD;
Nick I" said Sebastian, approaching.&#xD;
" I obsarved it, my lad, and I'm glad it's&#xD;
fever instead o' consumption; ,for I know how&#xD;
to treat a fever, and I don't consumption. I&#xD;
know sartin roots and yarbs that are p'ison&#xD;
on fever. I'll set right off arter 'em, and&#xD;
we'll have 'em biled up.in a twinklin' I"&#xD;
Nicholas took his gun and hatchet, and,&#xD;
started on this benevolent mission. He came&#xD;
back, staggering under a load of medicinal&#xD;
plants, some of which had attained the size of&#xD;
respectable bushes.&#xD;
"I got a little more nor I wanted, jes' to&#xD;
show a strong front to the inemy ; though we&#xD;
musn't give him so much that the fever won't&#xD;
have room to turn. A fever wants a little el-&#xD;
bow-room, in course."&#xD;
Talking in his genial and humorous way,&#xD;
Nick assorted the remedies, and instructed&#xD;
Sebastian how to prepare and administer&#xD;
them, although his notions were rather exag-&#xD;
gerate1 in regard to quantity-a fallacy which&#xD;
Sebastian had much trouble in correcting.&#xD;
But the plants, madeinto a decoction, and&#xD;
given to the patient, really had a salutary ef-&#xD;
feet. A gentle perspiration broke out upon&#xD;
the surface of the body,'his restlessness gra-&#xD;
dually subsided ;, and anon he slept peace-&#xD;
fully, unconscious of himself and all the&#xD;
world.&#xD;
CHAPTER X.&#xD;
TRAPPER VALLEY.&#xD;
The next day, after the morning'meal, and&#xD;
an earnest conversation with Sebastian, Nick&#xD;
prepared to leave camp. Pathaway asked&#xD;
him where he was .going, when he proceeded&#xD;
to speak of Pontneuf; whose capture by the&#xD;
outlaws, he affirmed, had occasioned him much&#xD;
anxiety.&#xD;
" Pm goin'," he went on to say, "to ex-&#xD;
p.ore Trapper Valley-though I warrant it'll&#xD;
be slow work.   There's a hunderd places&#xD;
where a thousan' men could hide 'thout diffi-&#xD;
kilty. The sides of the mountain are full of'&#xD;
rifts and caves, which can be diskivered on'y&#xD;
by s'archin' ; and when found, it would bother&#xD;
one 'td go to 'em ag'in of a dark night."&#xD;
"N iicholas," interposed Sebastian," you are&#xD;
going'to expose yourself to danger. Do not-,&#xD;
rashly put your life in the power of those.law-&#xD;
less men."&#xD;
" It's an errand of marcy, Sebastian. Think&#xD;
of Pontneuf and his darter-especially of the&#xD;
darter,". replied Nick, with a sigh of commis-&#xD;
eration.&#xD;
" I have thought, Uncle Nick," answered&#xD;
Sebastian, quickly. "It is terrible I--it makes&#xD;
&#xD;
MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS.                     85&#xD;
me shiver ! But you cannot reach her-I&#xD;
know you cannot."&#xD;
"It looks onpossible, and not onpossible,&#xD;
neither-for chance favors folks a thousand&#xD;
times when they don't expect it. If we should&#xD;
despair and give up when a thing looks hard,&#xD;
nothin' would be done, I allow. I knowed&#xD;
an instance," he added, impressively, " where&#xD;
a person e'enamost despaired ; but that indi-&#xD;
vidooal waited, and he done a thing that'll al-&#xD;
lers rejoice his heart--that'll be a comfort to&#xD;
him-a life-long comfort.''&#xD;
The youth took the trapper's hand, and re-&#xD;
plied :&#xD;
"It is a good and geperous spirit that&#xD;
promptsyou. If I could attend you and share&#xD;
the dangers, I wouldn't complain, Uncle Nick."'&#xD;
Then to Pathaway, who was regarding this&#xD;
scene with interest :&#xD;
"I'm , obliged to take care of Uncle Nicho-&#xD;
las-he'd run straight into danger if 'twasn't&#xD;
for me-though, in a case of this kind, it don't&#xD;
seem right to oppose him. T hope, sir, that&#xD;
you'll not allow. him to go alone. Two, it&#xD;
appears to me, would incur less risk than&#xD;
one."&#xD;
" Certainly I'll go," responded Pathaway.&#xD;
It is a case that enlists my sympathy. When&#xD;
woman is in danger, man must not pause to&#xD;
reason,"&#xD;
"He's a knowin' and a safe man,,but I'm&#xD;
afeard to leave you alone, Sebastian. They've&#xD;
diskivered iny old camp, and they'll find this,&#xD;
Should they come while I'm gone, what would&#xD;
becomeon ye?"&#xD;
The youth's brown eheeka paled, and an in-&#xD;
voluntary shiver shook his person.&#xD;
" Clearly, he has a great horror of these&#xD;
outlaws," remarked Pathaway, regarding the&#xD;
boy closely.&#xD;
"Yes," answered Niek, bstily; "he's&#xD;
afeard of 'em, for they give-him'a right smart&#xD;
fright,' once-though, fortinitly,,,he got away&#xD;
from 'em by running' like an Ingin and he&#xD;
didn't run, neither, for he was mounted on my&#xD;
boss--and, come to' think on't, 'twasn't my&#xD;
hoss, but his'n."&#xD;
"A race for life ?" said Pathaway.&#xD;
"It-,was; but he got away, as you see," an;&#xD;
swered the trapper.&#xD;
"Leavie. the dogs with me, and I shall do&#xD;
very well," said Sebastian.&#xD;
" Sartin, and I'll try and not be gone long.&#xD;
Take good care of the sick man and don't be&#xD;
afeard.  'Tisn't for to Trapper Valley, and&#xD;
one orb oth of us 'II come back afore night."&#xD;
" Then go; 'the dogs will take ca'e of me,&#xD;
and I can shoot very well, too, you know."&#xD;
Nick started once or twice, going back as&#xD;
often to give additional advice or instruction ;&#xD;
fairly 'on the way, he seemed to -lose his anx-&#xD;
iety for'-the youth, which gave place to the&#xD;
excitement of his new and hazardous under-&#xD;
taking. He was not very sanguine that he&#xD;
should be successful, but was confidentathat a&#xD;
careful survey of the Valley might shed ad-&#xD;

ditional light upon its mysteries. On this oc-&#xD;
casion he intended to make the attempt in&#xD;
open-daylight, and'trust to his experience and&#xD;
sagacity for eluding observation and detection.&#xD;
They arrived at the Devil's Gate without&#xD;
accident, having made the necessary descent&#xD;
with that'degree of cautiousness that circum-&#xD;
stances demanded. Nick crossed the portals&#xD;
-of the gate, followed by Pathaway-who was&#xD;
particularly struck with the formation of the&#xD;
place, especially the basaltic shafts and the&#xD;
tuuel-like passage. Having encountered be-&#xD;
fore the difficulties of this entrance, Nick had&#xD;
now less trouble than his companion in over-&#xD;
coming them. They reached the boiling&#xD;
spring, which Nick named the "Devil's Camp-&#xD;
Kettle."&#xD;
Pursuing their way, they scaled great rocks,&#xD;
swung themselves across chasms, and Inally&#xD;
reached the stream of water spoken of by the&#xD;
Shoshond. Crossing this on the stones, they&#xD;
found themselves in a strip of timber of con-&#xD;
siderable extent. The Valley was not very&#xD;
wide at that point ; but farther on, it stretched&#xD;
out to the right and left.&#xD;
Nick suddenly stopped, and Pathaway, look-&#xD;
ing up, saw a grizzly bear a few yards. in ad-&#xD;
vance of them. The bear turned around and&#xD;
growled, manifesting a decided disposition to&#xD;
dispute their progress.&#xD;
"It looks like the one we saw lhst night,"&#xD;
said Pathaway.&#xD;
" Bears are as thick as blackberries here-&#xD;
abouts, at this season of the year," said'Nich-&#xD;
olas.,&#xD;
"This is not a very safe place for bruin,"&#xD;
said the gray hunter, scrutinizing the bear,&#xD;
closely&#xD;
" I now it, mister ; but the critters haven't&#xD;
got no discreetion. It must be a young bear,&#xD;
or it 'd never make.its way to TrapperValley.&#xD;
But, then, the varmints are good for climbin',&#xD;
and can scramble up the mountain a pesky&#xD;
sight quicker'n you nor I can. But see : he&#xD;
don't 'pear:willin' to-let us- pass, so we'll 'es'&#xD;
turn to the right and shift over toward t'other&#xD;
side."&#xD;
" A very dogmatic bear," rejoined Patha-&#xD;
way.&#xD;
'Yes ; and ,I told him so t'other day. . Sez&#xD;
I: ' You're nothin' but an overgrown dog.'&#xD;
Pathaway smiled.,&#xD;
Th'e trapper struck off in the manner pro-&#xD;
posed, leaving bruin to enjoy his supremacy.&#xD;
" Thatresembles your tame bear," Pathaway&#xD;
remarked.&#xD;
" Summat.-summat," quoth Nick, careless-&#xD;
ly; "but lie's a good 'eal bigger ; and not&#xD;
bigger, either, but a size smaller. The var-&#xD;
nmmt that I had b'longed to an Ingin friendo'&#xD;
mine, who took him off the Lord on'y knows&#xD;
where."&#xD;
" I perceive that I was mistaken !" said&#xD;
Pathaway, drily.&#xD;
-T   parties had proceeded about a hundred&#xD;
rods   en a strange spectacle met their sight.'&#xD;
&#xD;
It was a man, mounted upon a horse, his hands&#xD;
tied behind him, and a rope about his neck,&#xD;
which rope was fastened to a limb overhead.&#xD;
They hastened to examine this singular ob-&#xD;
ject. That the person had been in this posi-&#xD;
tion a considerable time, was quite obvious.&#xD;
The horse, pinched with hunger, had gnawed&#xD;
the grass down to the roots, and eaten the&#xD;
lower branches of the trees as far as he could&#xD;
stretch his neck. The poor animal stood with&#xD;
head depressed, presenting a most melancholy&#xD;
figure, with his distinctly-defined ribs and&#xD;
gaunt outlines.  The unfortunate individual&#xD;
on his back was in-a still sorrier plight. His&#xD;
face was haggard, his eyes bloodshot, and his&#xD;
expression as hopeless as despair could render&#xD;
it.&#xD;
" En 'nom Dieu have pity on me, gentle-&#xD;
men !" he exclaimed, in a faint voice. -&#xD;
Pathaway sprang forward and cast the noose&#xD;
from his neck. The revulsion from horror to&#xD;
hope was too great ; the man gasped-two hot&#xD;
tears coursed down his ghastly cheeks, and he&#xD;
fell senseless into the arms of the hunter, who&#xD;
immediately placed him upon the ground,&#xD;
while Nick ran for some water, which he&#xD;
brought in his cap and dashed upon him.&#xD;
" He's- gone, I do believe !" said the trap-&#xD;
per. 4"And that poor animile under the tree&#xD;
has stood stock still in his tracks two whole&#xD;
days, I'll be bound ! See how his feet have&#xD;
worn into the site by a constant takin' 'em up&#xD;
and puttin' 'em down! Now, isn't that what ye&#xD;
call patience and obedience to the will o' man ?&#xD;
I'll wager my rifle that this poor feller's his&#xD;
master, and that they've growed attached to&#xD;
each other by long companionship. For&#xD;
faithfulness, give me a hoss, I say ! I love a&#xD;
hoss, by gracious !"&#xD;
" I'm with you, heart and soul ! The horse&#xD;
is is noble animal. Heavens ! what tortures&#xD;
both man and beast have suffered during the&#xD;
long, dreary, and frightfully monotonous&#xD;
hours they have been here !" answered Patha-&#xD;
way, with warmth.&#xD;
" He don't come out on't. 'Twas too sud-&#xD;
dint-the relief was. It has done his business&#xD;
quicker nor the rope."&#xD;
"His heart beats-there's a tremulous mo-&#xD;
tion of the pulse-a slight swelling of the&#xD;
throat-a faint flush upon his hollow cheeks.&#xD;
His eyes unclose-pour some water upon his&#xD;
lips."&#xD;
The man came back to consciousness with&#xD;
a sobbing sigh, and a thrill and quiver of&#xD;
the limbs, as the first wave of memory dashed&#xD;
upon his brain.&#xD;
"He musn't see the horse nor the tree," said&#xD;
Pathaway, considerately.&#xD;
" I allow not. The sight would bring back&#xD;
too forcibly the recollection of his awful diffi-&#xD;
kilty., I'll lead the faithful hes to the water&#xD;
while you 'tend to his master.'" q&#xD;
" Go-on, and I'll carry the unfortunate fel-&#xD;
low in my arms till he is able to help himself&#xD;
a little!"&#xD;
&#xD;
I,&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
Pathaway lifted the man with case, and bor&#xD;
him after Nick until he had reached the stream&#xD;
by which time he was quite conscious. Th&#xD;
hunter then mixed some spirits and water&#xD;
which the sufferer swallowed with famishin&#xD;
avidity. A hard biscuit that Nick had in hi&#xD;
pocket, softened in the -stream, was then giver&#xD;
hmn, which he devoured with that greedy&#xD;
haste that characterizes every stage of starve&#xD;
tion. The horse, meanwhile, was quenching&#xD;
his thirst with the clear, running water.&#xD;
No more-no more !" said Nicholas. "To&#xD;
much on't, arter a starve, isn't no better fo&#xD;
hosses nor 'tis for men.".-,&#xD;
Still compassionate and true to his kindly&#xD;
nature, the trapper divided his remaining bis-&#xD;
cuits with the horse ; and surely the animal&#xD;
was grateful-he expressed it in his eyes and&#xD;
ears, and in the manner in which he-rested his&#xD;
neck upon Nick's shoulder and whinnied.&#xD;
" Don't talk to me about animiles !" cried&#xD;
N ick. " I've studied 'em, and I know 'em.&#xD;
I've summered and wintered with'em ; feasted&#xD;
and starved, slept and waked with 'em; tend-&#xD;
ed 'em when they's sick, and cussed be the&#xD;
mnan who beats his hoss !"&#xD;
He struck himself upon the hip, and looked&#xD;
upward, confident that strong language would&#xD;
be forgiven on such a subject, then his face&#xD;
beamed mildly and lovingly upon the horse,&#xD;
and he thought how many miles he had been&#xD;
carried by his brethren.i&#xD;
Pathaway began to admire Nick Whiffles--&#xD;
there was tenderness and simplicity in him-&#xD;
and those virtues cover a multitude of human&#xD;
sins. He who cannot feel for a beast is a beast.&#xD;
".The friend of the hoss and the dog is the&#xD;
friend of everybody. He who abuses one or&#xD;
t'other, will abuse all human kind. Them&#xD;
is my sentiments,,by mighty I"&#xD;
" Mon Dieu!" said the owner of the horse.&#xD;
Is that you, Neck Wheefles, or is this one&#xD;
grand dream-one ver' great deception ?"&#xD;
"Pontneuf, I swear to gracious!' I didn't&#xD;
know ye-the. condemned hanging' has took&#xD;
the nat'ralness all out of ye !"&#xD;
The voyageur grew pale at the mention of&#xD;
hanging, and nervously put his hand to his&#xD;
neck, around which was a purple;line distinct-&#xD;
y defined, the cord having been drawn straight,&#xD;
so that the least motion to the right or left, or&#xD;
any direction, produced a degree of strangula-&#xD;
"I heerd about your misfortin, and he and I&#xD;
ventured into the Valley to see if we could git&#xD;
any clue of your whereabouts. I'm afeard to&#xD;
ask ye about Nanny. 'Tisn't a subject that ean&#xD;
be pleasant to ye. But there'll be time eriough ;.&#xD;
you can tell the whole story arter we git ye&#xD;
out o' this condemned onnat'ral place.'But&#xD;
we must leave the hoss, though I hateto have&#xD;
ye part with the critter, because he didn't part&#xD;
with you when martin' would a been sartin&#xD;
death 'to ye. There isn't no help for't, :but&#xD;
there's plenty d' gras and water, and 'tien't&#xD;
like leaving' him to starve."&#xD;
&#xD;
, V.&#xD;
e    Nicholas took Pontneuf upon his shoulders&#xD;
a, and carried him across the stream.&#xD;
o " Put me down, mon ami; you s'all take hold&#xD;
r, my arm, and I will walk. My legs is ver' weak&#xD;
g and cramp ; I set so long-so 'ver'. long I I&#xD;
s zank you, Monsieur Neek Wheefles."&#xD;
a The trapper placed Pontneuf upon his feet,&#xD;
y but his limbs were sostiff and paralyzed that&#xD;
- he could make no progress ; so Nick carried&#xD;
him again. Looking back after making their&#xD;
way a, considerable distance, Pathaway per-&#xD;
o ceived, much to his surprise, that the voy-&#xD;
r ageur's horse was following, which circum-&#xD;
stance he communicated to its owner.&#xD;
"Bon cheval! bon cheval ! he fuller me every-&#xD;
where as I s'all go. He will riot leave me ne-&#xD;
l vare, nevare !" said Pontneuf, earnestly.&#xD;
" The critter'll break his neck if he isn't&#xD;
pesky keerful. It's about as much as humans&#xD;
can do .to steer theirselves over these rocks.&#xD;
Hold on to me tighpt, old boy, and I'l git ,ye&#xD;
outso' this little diflikilty afore-long,, Here's&#xD;
the Devil's Camp-Kittle, and a few steps ahead&#xD;
is Devil's Gate."&#xD;
Assisted by Pathaway, and lightening the&#xD;
task by his cheery reniarks, Nick emerged in&#xD;
safety from the dark tunnel, and placed his&#xD;
friend on firmer and smoother footing. While&#xD;
resting, they heard the horse neigh, and pre&#xD;
sently the creature appeared uninjured, ap-&#xD;
parently, by slip or fall.&#xD;
Pontneuf staggered to meet his favorite, and&#xD;
throwing both arms around his neck, hugged&#xD;
him, and shed tears ; while the animal returned&#xD;
these caresses by low, expressive whinnies that-&#xD;
could not be misinterpreted.&#xD;
" His bones begin to show," quoth Nick,&#xD;
"but bones wont hurt a hoss, as long as they're&#xD;
in jints ; but if they's:all in one pieee, the crit-&#xD;
ter would be stiff-like and onpliable."&#xD;
Pathaway turned inquiringly to Nick, but&#xD;
the latter's peculiar visage was so quiet and&#xD;
honest, that he was puzzled to know whether&#xD;
he was in jest or earnest. Each, taking an arm&#xD;
of the voyageur, helped him up the ascent, and&#xD;
in half.an hour they were clear of the myste-&#xD;
rious precincts of Trapper Valley. Pontneuf&#xD;
glanced back at it with a shudder. He was&#xD;
thinking of what he had suffered-and of his&#xD;
daughter Ninon.   A   thousand 'distressing&#xD;
thoughts went whirling through the voyageur's&#xD;
brain ; he pictured his darling girl in the out-&#xD;
law lair, subjected to indignities that wrung his&#xD;
paternal nature. He fell upon his face and,&#xD;
gave himself up to emotions that were not dis-&#xD;
honorable to him as a man and a father. -,He&#xD;
was permitted to indulge in this outburst of&#xD;
grief without interruption. Calmer for the in-&#xD;
ternal storm, and his spirit washed and pu'-&#xD;
fied, as it were, with tears, he arose.&#xD;
must pardon ie ver'.much! I cry like one&#xD;
child. I nevare -was so weak, nesare!? Oh !&#xD;
ma jolie Ninon!"'&#xD;
" You are understood-you are understood,"&#xD;
said Pathaway, sympathetically, the steriess&#xD;

tcbthofewilderness wildness. The person of fantile and full of novelty. The past, with&#xD;
th female eestrienne was not large, but him, was dim, fragmentary, and chaotic, like&#xD;
hpefy and astreeable to the eye. From the  one's recollections of the scenes of infancy and&#xD;

T&#xD;
&#xD;
PATHAWAY ; OR, THE&#xD;
among mountains and streams, upon lakes and&#xD;
prairies, and of a love that, at some period,&#xD;
had absorbed his thoughts, and influenced the&#xD;
actions of his life ; for Sebastian, as he re-&#xD;
turned to the camp, heard him singing :&#xD;
" My sweet-heart was a prairie-flower-&#xD;
She dwelt beside the flowing water;&#xD;
I stole at midnight to her bower-&#xD;
I loved a wandering trapper's daughter&#xD;
Oh ! the trapper's- daughter !"&#xD;
The words and the plaintive voice affected&#xD;
the youth. He sighed, and tears started to&#xD;
his eyes. His breast heaved like a woman's.&#xD;
There was much tenderness in the boy. Pos-&#xD;
sibly, the voice was like one he had heard&#xD;
somewhere ; who knows? There are a thou-&#xD;
sand things that make us sad without our&#xD;
knowing why. Sometimes a single tone makes&#xD;
us thrill. Why is it? Because it connects"&#xD;
us mysteriously with the past.   '&#xD;
How inexplicable is that passion which even&#xD;
the extinction of reason cannot smother ; that&#xD;
will break out like hidden fire, glow up a mo-&#xD;
ment with -a touch of its former fervor, and&#xD;
then die away like the transient flame of a&#xD;
wisp of burning flax!,&#xD;
The mournful chorus followed Sebastian to&#xD;
the hut : " Oh ! the trapper's daughter !"&#xD;
" Wondrously like!' murmured the lad.&#xD;
"The same mouth ; the same reflective eyes&#xD;
and massy brow ; and," he added, thoughtful-,&#xD;
ly, " has loved a trapper's daughter!"&#xD;
The boy fell into a; it of musing; it became&#xD;
him, too ; for his face had a touching beauty,&#xD;
rendered yet more beautiful by the drooping&#xD;
wing of Melancholy.&#xD;
Brightening, by-and-by, he called the dogs&#xD;
and fed them--talking to them, meanwhile,&#xD;
as if they were creatures. capable of conmpre-&#xD;
hending human speech.        V,&#xD;
"'Smuggler, you are over-modest. Take&#xD;
that bit ; it is for you. Misfortune, you are&#xD;
overbearing ;tyou are what, among men, is,&#xD;
called a tyrant. Eat what I give you, and be&#xD;
content. You have a bad name, sir---but lit-&#xD;
tle betters than your former one.; though Ca-&#xD;
lamity and Misfortune mean much the same&#xD;
thing. I wish uncle Nick would still call you'&#xD;
Calamity; for I like not to be followed by a&#xD;
dog called Misfortune--a dog that follows- a&#xD;
great many people. Old friends are you and&#xD;
Nicholas ! He has told me a great many sto-&#xD;
ries about you--how faithful you have been&#xD;
to him, and how many.'condemned little diffi.'&#xD;
kilties' you both got into and got out of,. You&#xD;
don't look like-an old'dog, either. And as for&#xD;
beauty-ah ! you're not handsome, sir-you're&#xD;
not handsome ! You are ,shaggy, and look&#xD;
sour, and never wag your'tail on anybody but&#xD;
Kek and me. But thou art a very honest&#xD;
dog-a very honest dog, indeed !" .&#xD;
" Wah ! wah !"                's&#xD;
It was a rough voice that uttered these&#xD;
sounds-a voice that made Sebastian turn&#xD;
with a convulsive start. Two men entered the&#xD;
hut-Ben Joice and Zene Beck-who, though&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS.                      89&#xD;
often biekerug and quarreling were kindred&#xD;
natures, and hunted in couples.&#xD;
"Ingin boy--ialf-breed--alone in cam&#xD;
eat him up-swaller him whole. Ugh! ugh!"&#xD;
added Ben Joice, imitating the Indian style of&#xD;
communication, and assuming a threatening&#xD;
aspect for the purpose of playing upon the&#xD;
lad's fears, who drew back toward the dogs,&#xD;
and stood motionless as a statue.&#xD;
" Young-tender-build fire-roast him.,&#xD;
Wah !" continued Ben, making a horribly ugly&#xD;
face.&#xD;
Zene Beck, perceiving that Sebastian seemed&#xD;
ready to fall down with terror, burst into a&#xD;
loud laugh.&#xD;
" White men-great chiefs--might, war-&#xD;
riors-half-Ingin boy prisoner-- o wit us-&#xD;
walk prairies-slow fre-burn--baim-wa-wa I"&#xD;
added Ben.&#xD;
"There ! Stop, Ben,.or you'll frighten the&#xD;
little yaller varmint to death."' Then to Se-&#xD;
bastian: "Fly round, you half-breed saawn,&#xD;
and cook somethin' to eat. 'There's a piece o'&#xD;
bufferler ; knife it off in a minute and puti it.&#xD;
to the fire," said Zene Beck.&#xD;
"Not too fast. Who keeps camp ?" said&#xD;
Ben.&#xD;
Sebastian tried to -speak, but at first his&#xD;
voice was so low as to-be inaudible.&#xD;
"Speak up, you chicken! !What's the mat-&#xD;
ter, eh ? Don't ye know anything ?" groped&#xD;
Ben, making an ominous rattling"with his w'ea-&#xD;
pons.&#xD;
" Nick Whiffles !" said Sebastian, distinctly.&#xD;
Joice and Beck exchanged glances. It was&#xD;
clear that they did not relish this information.&#xD;
Zene scowled and shook his head.&#xD;
" Pooh ! pooh!" exclaimed Joiee. " Ain't&#xD;
afeard of a name, be ye ? Don't care nofe&#xD;
for Nick Whiffles.nor I do for a bufferlercualf.&#xD;
Let's sarch round and see if he's got anything&#xD;
drinkable 'bout the primises."&#xD;
"I advise you not to meddle much among&#xD;
Uncle Nick's things," said sebastian, whose&#xD;
emotions did not appear to arise from a re"al&#xD;
spirit of cowardice.&#xD;
"Zene, masticate that little yaller boy!.&#xD;
Bone him-bolt him! I'l. take a peep undr&#xD;
this pile o' boughs, and in the corners gier'ly,&#xD;
Sieh critters as this lank Nick Whifes alters&#xD;
keep some choice sperrits agin acidents."&#xD;
Joice went feeling- about in every corner of&#xD;
the camp, and finally -lighted upon a keg of&#xD;
'whisky, which Nick had kept Carefully for ur-&#xD;
gent occasions. He gave a loud whoop at this&#xD;
discovery, with along addition of erabbed In-&#xD;
dian, which was finally choked offly a stream&#xD;
of the much-prized liquor, which went down&#xD;
his throat with that peculiar sopnd character-&#xD;
istie of drinking from such a vessel. After a&#xD;
frightful draught, he passed the keg to Beek,&#xD;
smacked hia lips, drewthe sleeve of his hunt-&#xD;
ing-shirt across his beard, and having enjoyed&#xD;
the flavor a moment in silence, asked  -&#xD;
tian   Where's he gone ? When'll he come&#xD;
back ?"&#xD;

Thenawe must hurry up. Fix the fire and&#xD;

"Don't threaten me," answered Sebastian,&#xD;
pointing at the dogs.&#xD;
"Bah I 'Speet I'm  afeard of a couple o'&#xD;

clinched right in with 'em on equal tarnis,&#xD;

and hold 'em up as I would a couple o' kittens,-&#xD;
and knock their heads together wounded hard,&#xD;
too !"&#xD;
" That dog"--pointing to Misfortune, whose&#xD;
back was bristling, and whose eyes were flam-&#xD;
ing with mischief-"but waits my command&#xD;
to tear; you in pieces !" answered Sebastian,&#xD;
with sudden sprit.,&#xD;
" iliti-to !y , My son John !" exclaimed&#xD;

As it happened, Zene placed-the keg upon&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
WHICH TREATS OF VARIOUS MATTERS.&#xD;
The drenching draught that Ben Joice had&#xD;
swdllowed was operating ' upon' his brain,&#xD;
-arousing'what was vicious within hiin, making&#xD;
him valorous, boastful, and ready to quarrel&#xD;
with whoever or whatever might be disposed to&#xD;
take offence eAthis conduct. He stared at the&#xD;
dogs with stupid wonder, then with fierce and&#xD;
fast kindling ire. He took a hesitating and ex-&#xD;
perimental'step foi'ward, but the prestige of the&#xD;
dog Misfortnne -became so ominous that he&#xD;
paused, doubting the propriety ofa farther ad-&#xD;
vance. 'Finding that he could use his tongue&#xD;
with less danger than his feet. he emptied upon&#xD;
them from hislawless mouth a torrent of invec-&#xD;
tive of which persons of his type only are nias-&#xD;
ter ; but which, so far from intimidating his&#xD;
canine opponents, served but to inflame their&#xD;
ferocity. They arose warily to their feet, and&#xD;
displayed their teeth in concert.&#xD;
" Don't provoke them, if you value life !"&#xD;
said Sebastian, warningly.&#xD;
Joiee stepped back; brimming with wrath.&#xD;
To, rob a 'wild, free trapper of his whisky,&#xD;
especially when under its influence, is to give&#xD;
mortal offence. His keen and whetted appe-&#xD;
tite. longs for the maddening potion, and&#xD;
brooks not patiently the thwarting of his de-&#xD;
sires. Benifelt in.his belt for a pistol, but dis-&#xD;
covered, to. his chagrin, that the weapon was&#xD;
not there.&#xD;
'Give re your pistols, Zene, and I'll fix&#xD;
them ere brutes quicker'n an Ingin can take a&#xD;
Akblp I"&#xD;
Joiee stretched his hand backward without&#xD;
.taking his eyes from the dogs.&#xD;
"Left 'em at camp," answered Zene. "Bill&#xD;
Brace wanted 'em'."&#xD;
"Curse -the luck ! I left mine, too. That's&#xD;
alles the way; when you want a thing you&#xD;
hadn't got it. Look at them confounded pups,&#xD;
will re+ They're layin' right on our weepons,&#xD;
and thete's that keg' o' sperrit right atween&#xD;
'em."&#xD;
"Pups! precious nice pups! bull-dogs, I&#xD;
should say. Now look here, Ben.; I've heerd&#xD;
of Nic'k'Whiffles'- dogs. That savagerous look-&#xD;
in' trieis the same critter that he used to call&#xD;
Calainity, I'll bet' two hoss-loads o' peltries !&#xD;
lIe's An: aWful varmint, and I shouldn't care to&#xD;
tackle' hinif I : had forty pistils.  Hillo !&#xD;
'where's my -khiife '"&#xD;
Zene felt for his favorite weapon.&#xD;
"You little mixed-up Ingin heathenswhere's&#xD;
my knife-?" he asked, turning threateningly to&#xD;
Sebastian,who 'had edged toward the dogs, and&#xD;
now stoodbeSide them.&#xD;
" A trick! ta trick I" cried Joice, furiously.&#xD;
" Toss 'em here, you traitor ! Don't play with&#xD;
the grizzly's claws, 'less you want to be tore to&#xD;
pieces."&#xD;
Ben swelled out his chest, scowled, and dis-&#xD;
torted his mouth to subdue the boy with fear ;&#xD;
but he quietly held up the weapons in his right&#xD;

hand, saying, with a calmness that took them&#xD;
by surprise :&#xD;
" Attempt to take them, and I'll launch&#xD;
these dogs upon you like lightning ! I have&#xD;
only to exclaim, sharply, ' down with the&#xD;
brutes!' and they dart at you like panthers."&#xD;
Ben Joice puffed the breath slowly from his&#xD;
dilated chest, stared a moment at Sebastian,&#xD;
and swallowing his rage,"went slowly back to his&#xD;
meal. Though baffled, he was not conquered,&#xD;
and as he sent installment after installment into&#xD;
that craving gulf, the stomach, he growled be-&#xD;
tween the mouthfuls, leering at the youth from&#xD;
under his beetling brows in a manner that&#xD;
boded no good.&#xD;
Presently he began to talk with Zene in a&#xD;
fashion calculated to terrify the listener. His&#xD;
companion fell into his vein, and as the liquor&#xD;
worked more potently, they told frightful&#xD;
stories, and boasted of their lawless exploits in&#xD;
the mountains ; of bloody feuds with brother&#xD;
trappers ; of unprovoked encounters with the&#xD;
Indians, and finally of robberies and assassin-&#xD;
ations in the lonely passes, closing with an un-&#xD;
feeling allusion to the man they had shot in the&#xD;
caion.&#xD;
" We'd had a fine time at euttin' and slash-&#xD;
in' if Cap'n Dick hadn't interfered," remarked&#xD;
Joice. "A  devil of a boy. is Cap'n Dick !&#xD;
He'll have his own way, if it costs a man or&#xD;
two."&#xD;
" Don't talk of our quarrel; because you's in&#xD;
the wrong, Ben. I've been sorry, sometimes,&#xD;
that we did that. - A smart trapper was An-&#xD;
drew Jeanjean. I knowed him several years&#xD;
ago. He 'peard a hearty, honest chap, allers&#xD;
quiet enough, if you minded your business and&#xD;
didn't ineddle with his'n. I b'longed to a bri-&#xD;
gade with him a short time, and that was the&#xD;
way I happened to know him. We had a lit-&#xD;
tle trouble once, for he usedd me of takin'&#xD;
beaver and otter from his traps, which," added&#xD;
Zene, ingenuously, " I sartinly did. I told him-&#xD;
he lied, when he knocked me down without&#xD;
ceremony.\ If he hadn't done that, I don't&#xD;
think he'd be sleepin' down in the canon."&#xD;
"Bah! there allers was a white stripe in&#xD;
you. You must l'arn to look upon these things&#xD;
as matters of business. We're the lords o' the&#xD;
sile, and all that don't b'long to our jolly boys&#xD;
is our prey, and must pay tribute to us. A&#xD;
conscience, Zene Beck, is a useless piece o' lum-&#xD;
ber to be totin'. about in the mountains." Then&#xD;
turning his dogged eyes to Sebastian, added,&#xD;
still addressing Zene : "I'll git ye to go out,&#xD;
and dig a hole to put that sparrow-legged boy&#xD;
in."&#xD;
The sparrow-legged boy, although very pale,&#xD;
was more self-possessed than could have been&#xD;
anticipated at the outset, and did not appear&#xD;
to heed this sinister observation. It must not&#xD;
be supposed that the anger of Joice had cooled ;&#xD;
on the contrary, their villainous conversation&#xD;
had excited and rendered it more dangerous,&#xD;
though, perhaps, less impetuous. In fact, both&#xD;

MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS.                       43&#xD;
the ruffians were racking their brains for an ar-&#xD;
tifice or expedient by which to free themselves&#xD;
from their awkward dilemma.&#xD;
"Poor Jeanjean !" said Beck, perceiving that&#xD;
this topic affected Sebastian." I dreamed about&#xD;
him last night. But 'twas in the way o' busi-&#xD;
ness, as you say ; and arter all, it don't make no&#xD;
great difference whether we pop over a buffaler&#xD;
or a man.--Yah ! yah !"&#xD;
Zene Beck suddenly thrust his head in the&#xD;
direction of Sebastian, and making a horrible&#xD;
face, perpetrated the last exclamations in a&#xD;
style that would have startled one unused to the&#xD;
freaks of free trappers. The boy recoiled.&#xD;
* Wah ! wah !" vociferated Joice, with an ex-&#xD;
plosiveness that was yet more alarming.&#xD;
A slight thrill ran over the boy, but he&#xD;
grasped the knives more firmly.&#xD;
There was a rustling of leaves, a crackling of&#xD;
twigs -breaking 'beneath footsteps. A pale,&#xD;
haggard face presented itself at the door ; the&#xD;
eyes were large, fixed, and expressionless. It&#xD;
was the wounded trapper. The bandage had&#xD;
slipped from his head, and there were fresh, red&#xD;
stains upon his hair around the wound.&#xD;
The features of the ruffians blanched with&#xD;
horror. Believing that they saw before them&#xD;
the ghost of the murdered trapper, they sprang&#xD;
through the side-of the camp as if its frail walls&#xD;
were pasteboard, and ran from the spot as if&#xD;
pursued by an avenging angel. Sebastian&#xD;
heard them bounding away with the speed of&#xD;
hunted buffaloes, and clasping his brow with&#xD;
his hands, stood motionless a long time. When,&#xD;
at length, he looked up, the wounded man had&#xD;
not changed his attitude, nor his stony vacancy&#xD;
of eye and face.&#xD;
By-and-by he timidly approached the dogs,&#xD;
and as they did not repel his -advances, he sat&#xD;
down by Smuggler, stroked his glossy coat&#xD;
with childlike satisfaction and curiosity. The&#xD;
instinct of the animals told them that Andrew&#xD;
Jeanjean was one to be dealt gently with. Oc-&#xD;
casionally he paused, as if a laggard ray of&#xD;
reason had overtaken him, but could find no&#xD;
fitting entrance to the temple of Understand-&#xD;
ing. Usually, when this occurred, he mutter-&#xD;
ed, and sang snatches of " The Trapper's&#xD;
Daughter."&#xD;
Sebastian, having in a measure recovered&#xD;
from his trepidation, looked out anxiously for&#xD;
Nick ; but perceiving no welcome sign of his&#xD;
coming, consoled himself as best he could, un-&#xD;
der the circumstances.&#xD;
"It's not time, yet," he said. "Trapper&#xD;
Valley is a long walk from here."  Anon he&#xD;
added, complainingly. "Am I never to lose&#xD;
sight of those fearful men ? They pass before&#xD;
me like spectres. Their appearance revives&#xD;
recollections that fill me with terror. But I&#xD;
must struggle to be, brave and, cheerful on&#xD;
Nick's account as well as my own. Kind, quaint&#xD;
Nick ! His presence makes me feel safe, and&#xD;
sometimes content-almost happy. And why&#xD;
not quite happy ?" he continued, amusingly.&#xD;

PATHAWAY ; OR, THE MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS.     45&#xD;
&#xD;
The .youth stopped, as if to find an answer&#xD;
to this question. He went on :&#xD;
"Then comes this man Pathaway. What&#xD;
shall I say of this man Pathaway ?"&#xD;
Sebastian was troubled. This query per-&#xD;
plexed' hin, apparently, more than the pre-&#xD;
vious one. He stood with clasped hands and&#xD;
bent head, thinking of it a long time; then he&#xD;
paced slowly back and forth under the trees&#xD;
before the camp, pursuing, perhaps, the same&#xD;
train of thought, which was finally interr-upt-&#xD;
ed by the return of Nick and Pathaway, ac-&#xD;
companied by the French voyageur.&#xD;
4"What's the diffikilty, little 'un ?" inquired&#xD;
Nicholas, glancing about curiously. "Been&#xD;
nmakin' a holein the side o' the camp, hain't&#xD;
ye? That's to let more oxygin in, I s'pose."&#xD;
"I've had visitors, Nicholas," answered Se-&#xD;
bastian, with a perceptible shiver. "Unwel-&#xD;
come guests, I assure you-Ben Joice and Ze-&#xD;
nass Beck. They revived such-"&#xD;
"Yes, I understan' !" interposed Nick.&#xD;
"They've frightened ye about to death, I'll be&#xD;
bound. I wish I'd been here, by mighty!&#xD;
Wouldn't they ketehed it ? Wouldn't they got'&#xD;
sunthin' ?" he added, raising his voice and his&#xD;
hands at the same moment, " wouldn't they got&#xD;
sunthuin' that they never got afore, and wouldn't&#xD;
never hadl ro need on ag'in ? Did they hurt&#xD;
you, sonny? Did they lay a finger on ye,&#xD;
unbug? If they did, jes' say the word, and&#xD;
my head sha'n't- touch blanket ag'in till the&#xD;
mean skunkshave got their desarts. Where&#xD;
was Smuggler ? Where, on airth was Misfor-&#xD;
tin?"&#xD;
"Present and faithful. They behaved nobly.&#xD;
They've been a credit to you, Uncle Nick.&#xD;
Look and satisfy yourself."&#xD;
Sebastian pointed to the keg and the trap-&#xD;
per's rifles.&#xD;
The whole truth suggested itself to Nick at&#xD;
once. His kindly countenance beamed benev-&#xD;
olently upon his canine friends.&#xD;
"I have observed," said Pathaway, "that&#xD;
you display singular tastein the names of your&#xD;
dogs and Horse."&#xD;
Although -the gray hunter addressed this re-&#xD;
mark to Nick, his attention was fixed upon Se-&#xD;
bastian with a wondering, perplexed intensity-&#xD;
that was almost painful._&#xD;
" Yes," answered Nick, mildly, "I have my&#xD;
idees. everybody has his idees. I change-&#xD;
the names of my animiles, 'eationally, same as'&#xD;
the Ingins change the names of, their braves.&#xD;
Thhit critter's name used to be Calamity.; but&#xD;
arter I got into the p'ison newspapers, I&#xD;
changed it to Misfortin."&#xD;
At lihat moment, ,Portneuf, who bad been&#xD;
carried by Daphnis the latter part of the way,&#xD;
caught sight of the wounded trapper, and&#xD;
evinced considerable surprise.&#xD;
" Ah! what do I see ! It is my ver' good&#xD;
friend, Andrew Jeanjean ! Mon Dieu-! - Is'all&#xD;
be ver' much amaze. What has happen ?"&#xD;
" This," said Nick to Sebastian,-"is Port-&#xD;
neuf, the voyageur. We found him in a dread-&#xD;
&#xD;
ful plight-with a rope round his neck, and&#xD;
his horse for his executioner. He was starvin'&#xD;
and sufferin' horribly. Look at him, sonny,&#xD;
and see what terrible goin's on there is down&#xD;
in Trapper Valley.&#xD;
" Oh ! oh !" exclaimed Sebastian.&#xD;
" And, Ptoo, for that matter,' and all the&#xD;
rest of the alph bit. A day or two in that po-&#xD;
sition will put white threads in the blackest&#xD;
hair, I allow. But don't think' on't-don't&#xD;
think ot! It's too much for a lad who's so&#xD;
ruinated, as 'twere, by the scarlet fever; and not&#xD;
so much by the scarlet fever as by other things&#xD;
neither."-&#xD;
There was something in the tenderness with&#xD;
which Nick treated the boy, and the readiness&#xD;
with which he made excuses for his girlish&#xD;
weaknesses, that excited in a pre-eminent man-&#xD;
ner the interest of Pathaway. He had ob-&#xD;
served, as who would not, that the trapper's&#xD;
apologies were not always consistent, but al-&#xD;
most without exception contradictory, and&#xD;
that he unconsciously mixed them with the&#xD;
ludicrous.&#xD;
" Ninon ?" queried Sebastian, earnestly.&#xD;
Nicholas shook his head sorrowfully.&#xD;
" Nothin' yet---nothin' yet, but we're all&#xD;
hopin' for the best ; and," he added, philoso-&#xD;
phically, " when sevril people hope for a thing&#xD;
airnest, it's apt to happen. I've obsarved it&#xD;
time arter time, and the cowincidence was&#xD;
startlin'; and not startlin' neither, but oncom-&#xD;
mon ; and not so much oncoinmon," he con-&#xD;
tinued, reverentially, in a lower voice, " as&#xD;
providential."&#xD;
" Who is this Jeanjean?" asked Pathaway,&#xD;
addressing the voyageur,&#xD;
"A trapper, and once a bourgeois  I knew&#xD;
him ver' well." - Then to Jeanjean: - How do&#xD;
you  do, mon, friend?  Ah ! how   pale ! I&#xD;
nevare s all see you so pale !",&#xD;
"Oh ! the trapper's daughter-&#xD;
Oh ! the trapper's daughter !"&#xD;
sang Jeanjean, in accents more plaintive than&#xD;
ordinary.&#xD;
" I s'all bd so-what you call him-aston-&#xD;
ish!" said Portneuf, quite bewildered by the&#xD;
strange manner of the trapper.&#xD;
" He's been in a condemned little diffikilty ;&#xD;
and' not so little, neither, for it upset all his&#xD;
fakilties , and nighabout snuffed the candle of&#xD;
his life,"-answered Nick, explanatorily. ."You&#xD;
see aman afore ye that's been shot, exassinat-&#xD;
ed, killed,.buried, resurrectionized, and resuf-&#xD;
focated, all. o' which happened in a lonesome&#xD;
caiion not fur from Trapper Valley. This is&#xD;
the man"-pointing to Pathaway-" who did&#xD;
it; and that isn't what I mean, neither; but&#xD;
that he dug him up and brung him to. Sebas-&#xD;
tian, we must go to cooking ; for the French-&#xD;

called a nat'ral bone-setter. Be in a hurry,&#xD;
lad, for we've got the condemndest stumich&#xD;
to cook for that ever darkened a camp-door.&#xD;
Our family's increasin', sonny. We'll have a&#xD;
hospital here by-and-by, by mighty ! Spent&#xD;
a year in a hospital once, I did, when I's a boy,&#xD;
studyin' doctor stuff. That was down in the'&#xD;
clearin's, afore I took to the bush. The hos-&#xD;
pital I was in was suntimes called an Infarm-&#xD;
lty".-... .&#xD;
" Infirmary," suggested Sebastian.&#xD;
"'Bliged io ye, little 'un. Remember the&#xD;
head of the 'stablishment very well. Seems&#xD;
as if I could see him smokin' his short pipe ;&#xD;
for a confarmed smoker of the narcootic weed&#xD;
was the doctor. There wasn't his equal in tell-&#xD;
in' stories, neither. To hear him, you'd think&#xD;
that he'd conquered all the disorders, com-&#xD;
plaints, maladies,. eperdemics, plagues, 'rup-&#xD;
tions, and other sicknesses that humans is sub-&#xD;
jeck to. He hated minerils dreadful, and said&#xD;
that all sorts o' calomy-another slice, little&#xD;
'un-red lead, blue-pill, and canine was p'ison&#xD;
to the system. Arter I'd been there awhile,&#xD;
the doctor used to let me try my hand at them&#xD;
that he was practicin' at. ,You'd  oughter&#xD;
seen," added Nick, holding out the stew-pan&#xD;
in one hand, and a fagot in the other, " the&#xD;
fixin's he had in his infarmity-the het baths,&#xD;
the cold baths, and the b'ilers ; 'specially the&#xD;
b'ilers-steam-}oxes he tarmed'um; butthey's&#xD;
reg'lar b'ilers, by mighty ! You see there's&#xD;
some affections-don't cut your fingers, sonny&#xD;
-that won't come out 'cept by b'ilin'. We&#xD;
used to bile 'em right smart ! Igot to be mas-&#xD;
ter b'iler afore three- months. Well, as I's&#xD;
sain'-don't step into the kittle, boy, and&#xD;
don't be lookin' at me so queer-he let me'&#xD;
have a chance now and then at 'em. He hap-&#xD;
pened to have 'mong his patients an Irishman&#xD;
with a bad leg, which was a fever-sore or some-&#xD;
thin' o' that natur. The doctor had a good&#xD;
'cal o' country practice, and was often gone a&#xD;
week at a time, like an old-fashioned Methodist.&#xD;
minister on a circuit. This was about the,&#xD;
time when the hot-crop systum begun to be in&#xD;
vogue, which was many years ago. Now the&#xD;
doctor didn't go by guess-work, but allers had&#xD;
a plan which he follered. He cured every-&#xD;
thing with a Lobely course o' medicine, the-&#xD;
botanic name of which was screw-auger. A&#xD;
course o'-medicine was a 'metic, and a 'metie&#xD;
was a course o' medicine."-&#xD;
"I'm goin' away,' sez the doctor, arter he'd&#xD;
showed me the patient.&#xD;
"' Very well,' sez I.&#xD;
"'This is a bad leg,' sez he.&#xD;
"' It's a condemned bad leg !' sez I.&#xD;
"'He must throw it up,' sez he.-&#xD;
"'Nothin' more nor less,' sez I.&#xD;
" ' Give him a 'metic every day till I git&#xD;
back,' sez he.&#xD;
"'Will it 'feet the leg ?' sez I.&#xD;
"''Twon't 'feet nothin' else,' sez he. 'And&#xD;
be sure,' to keep him in a horizontal position.&#xD;
&#xD;
"' As horizontal as you please,' sez I.&#xD;
' Then the doctor got into his wide one-hoss&#xD;
.gig, like that my gran'father traveled in in&#xD;
Centril Afriky, tetched up his old white hoss,&#xD;
and trundled away, saddle-bags, Lobely, kian,&#xD;
and all.'&#xD;
Nick gave the stew-pan a shake, and set it&#xD;
over the fire again.&#xD;
" Well," he added, " I went at the critter.&#xD;
The doctor was gone:sixteen days, and I puked&#xD;
the patient every day, by mighty! .Boy, put&#xD;
on another' stiek o' wood, and tend a little&#xD;
closter to your brile ; a brile has to be-looked&#xD;
arter."&#xD;
" How did this treatment affect him?" asked&#xD;
Pathaway, with a half-smile.&#xD;
" Powerful ! powerful ! 'Long toward the&#xD;
last don't I tied his well leg to the bed-post for&#xD;
fear thewrong one would come up. But not'-&#xD;
stannin' all the skill I laid out on the onnater-&#xD;
alized furriner, the lame limb didn't come up;&#xD;
but he fell away like p'ison durin' the time."&#xD;
Nick gave the stew-pan an extra shake,&#xD;
glanced quizzically' at Pathaway, then added,&#xD;
reflectively :&#xD;
" But it oughter done his business ! 'Twasn't&#xD;
no fault o' mine ; I gin him enough o'. the&#xD;
condemned stuff. There T!that sparrow-legged&#xD;
boy has dropped his meat in the ashes ! The&#xD;
doctor was summat astonished when he got&#xD;
home, for he didn't speet to be gone but a&#xD;
week when he went away. There was a little&#xD;
pucker,, as 'twere, round the corners of his&#xD;
mouth when I told-him what I'd done ; but he&#xD;
lighted his pipe and smoked right on, as usual.&#xD;
"', I think I'm well qualified- to . practise&#xD;
doctor-stuff,' sez I.&#xD;
' I think you be,' sez he, ' but there's one&#xD;
piece o' information I want to give ye ; which&#xD;
is, that all diseases is brung about by humors.&#xD;
No matter what a -person complains on, de-&#xD;
pend on't 'tis humors.'&#xD;
"I'm everlastin'ly obleeged to ye,' sez I,&#xD;
and the very next 'day left the doctor's, In-&#xD;
farmity, snatisfied that it wouldn't be safe for&#xD;
me to 'i'arn any more. Give me good food,&#xD;
good air, and good exercise, and I don't care&#xD;
for physic, by gracious! The human stomich&#xD;
never was intended for a slop-bowl,"&#xD;
Profoundly impressed with this idea, the&#xD;
trapper pondered a moment, and finished his&#xD;
train of thought by saying, with more than&#xD;
ordinary feeling, "Oh Lord, no !&#xD;
The gray hunter seemed not to notice Nick's&#xD;
closing remarks ; his eyes wandered with the&#xD;
same perplexed and half-painful inquisitiveness&#xD;
from him to the youth, and from the youth-&#xD;
to him; but they dwelt longest upon the&#xD;
youth.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;

Nicholas uttered these words hurriedly and  a responsive chord in his impromptu rami-&#xD;

&#xD;
the extreme of wildness. There was not that&#xD;
thinness and squalor of the face which ought,&#xD;
fittingly to have accompanied the setting of&#xD;
this free-trapper gem. Despite, his outside&#xD;
shabbiness, 'he had, clearly, been well fed.&#xD;
Immediately upon his introduction, he took&#xD;
a leisure survey of the partied within; then&#xD;
laying aside his gun, and throwing down his&#xD;
traps, greeted the parties with:&#xD;
"How are ye, -critters 9"&#xD;
Well's common, thank'e. Hope you loft&#xD;
your folks- well,?". answered Nick, ungra-&#xD;
ciously.&#xD;
eou a'n't seen no folks lately, 'ept Ingins.&#xD;
Been starvin' and hidin' on the Saskatchewan&#xD;
peraries near the extreme tip o' the South&#xD;
Branch. Had an awful time with the Black-&#xD;
feet. Glad to see white critters ag'in. I'm&#xD;
ruther run down in p'int o' clothes, but I don't&#xD;
s'pose it'll make no odds amongg Christians."&#xD;
It was visible from the manner of the gray&#xD;
hunter that he was not pleased with this new-&#xD;
comer. He observed that Sebastian watched&#xD;
him continually, and started at-the first sound&#xD;
of his voice, as persons sometimes start at sight&#xD;
of a serpent. "How unfitted," he thought,&#xD;
"is thislad for the life he is leading! He has&#xD;
no nerve ; his sensibilities are shoe ed bf the&#xD;
slightest circumstance ; he is weaker than a&#xD;
love-sick girl. And yet-and yet," mused&#xD;
Pathaway,."his wild beauty-faseinates mue in&#xD;
spite of myself. - If I feel a passing emotion of&#xD;
contempt, it yields to something strange and&#xD;
inexplicable that renders me melancholy and&#xD;
follows me in haunting dreams."&#xD;
"What's your name ?" inquired Nick,,&#xD;
sharply.&#xD;
"Hendricks, 'mong civilized critters," re-&#xD;
plied the person questioned, glancing at Port-&#xD;
neuf.&#xD;
"How happened ye to stumble on my&#xD;
camp ?" continued Nicholas, in the same tone._&#xD;
" ueer question to ask, brother, when you&#xD;
know that a hun gryfree trapper can smel a&#xD;
piece o' meat a dozen miles. Don't begrudge&#xD;
a feller being' somethin' to eat and a fire to&#xD;
warm him by, do ye ?"&#xD;
Hendricks, turning his eyes. slowly from&#xD;
Portneuf, met the fixed looks of Sebastian. A&#xD;
change came over him at once ; his under jaw&#xD;
fell, his mouth remained open in a mingled&#xD;
expression of wonder, curiosity, and something&#xD;
else that might have been construed into fear.&#xD;
This passed quickly away, but Hendricks had&#xD;
seen or aprehended that which-be could not&#xD;
forget. Had his swarthy features been freed&#xD;
from dirt and tan, they would have been found&#xD;
paler than Andrew Jeanjean's.&#xD;
Nick, who was busy with the fire, heaping&#xD;
the brands together and feeding it with sticks,&#xD;
did not notice the sudden perturbation of his&#xD;
visitor;. but with Pathaway, who was unoc-&#xD;
cupied, it did not pass without observation ;&#xD;
yet it was a thing to which he had no clue to&#xD;
guide him to its meaning.&#xD;
"I don't begrudge nobody nothin'," quoth&#xD;
&#xD;
Nick.. "Them as comes to my camp hungry&#xD;
and tired shall be fed and rested, if I've got&#xD;
the means of doin' it. , An honest, unlucky&#xD;
trapper never went away from my lodge dis-&#xD;
satisfied."&#xD;
" I'm sich a one as you describe, but I can't&#xD;
say my welcome has been o' the warmest,"&#xD;
replied Hendricks, with less confidence than&#xD;
before.&#xD;
"I dunno, I dunno !" responded Nicholas,&#xD;
doubtingly. "I ain't your jedge, and l'm&#xD;
glad don't, for I mightjedge ye too bard. But&#xD;
you haven't -got that open, straight' forrard&#xD;
look that I like, I swear to gracious !"&#xD;
Hendricks started up in a huff, scowling in&#xD;
an unfriendly manner at Nick.,&#xD;
"You want to fasten a quarrel on me, Nick&#xD;
Whiffles !" he said, bitinghis under lip.&#xD;
"You know me then, it 'pears ?" returned&#xD;
Nicholas, quietly.&#xD;
" You ain't sich a stranger in the Nor'weet&#xD;
that it need to surprise ye," answered Hen-&#xD;
dricks, measuring Nk from head to foot with&#xD;
his 'eyes. "It. may be safe for ye," he re-&#xD;
sumed, "to insult me here with your friends&#xD;
'round ye, but if we stood hand to hand on&#xD;
some lonely perarie or' in a dark pass, your&#xD;
tongue wouldn't, run on, so free, 1 reckon.&#xD;
But," he went on, picking up his traps and&#xD;
fowling-piece, "I'll remember 'this a in ye,&#xD;
and if you git any good on't you'll be wel-&#xD;
come to it."&#xD;
" You'd better eat afore ye go, for I'don't&#xD;
want anybody to go from my camp hungry.&#xD;
And," added Nicholas, looking quizzically at&#xD;
Hendrick's rotund. face, "you must a been&#xD;
'thout food a long time, 'edgin' by your 'pear-&#xD;
ance. - You've lost a leap o' flesh, that's&#xD;
plain, and I ,shouldn't wonder if you'dbeen&#xD;
fasten' more nor a week.&#xD;
Nick's irony was not without its effect&#xD;
upon its object. At..one moment he seemed&#xD;
ready to push matters to an unpleasant crisis,&#xD;
while at the next other emotions agitatedhim.&#xD;
When he looked, at Nick, he was manifestly&#xD;
disposed to quarrel with him; but when his&#xD;
regards strayed to Sebastian, which they did&#xD;
furtively and often, his belligerent feelings&#xD;
were diverted to a different channel. Master-&#xD;
ing whatever impulses rebelled against the&#xD;
movement, he threw down his traps, replaced&#xD;
his gun and said, doggedly,:&#xD;
" see that my room is better nor my com-&#xD;
pany, but I'll only stay long enough to swaller&#xD;
a cut from yonder piece o', meat,; pervidin,'&#xD;
allers, you think you cant spare it to an unfor-&#xD;
tinit devil who has lost his peltries and most&#xD;
of his traps in one way and another, atween&#xD;
Ingins and dishonest white men."&#xD;
" Jes' so!, Here's a knife, here's a stick,&#xD;
there's a fire ; you can cut, roast, and eat, to&#xD;
suit yourself.d&#xD;
"  ah!'' grunted Hendricks, and without&#xD;
farther invitation  commenced . operations,&#xD;
cooking and eating in grim silence. Patha-&#xD;
way was well assured that the manwos not at&#xD;

struggling with amazement, incredulity, and&#xD;

at once.&#xD;
He took his rifle from  its place as if he&#xD;
wou1id crush the iron barrel with his fingers;&#xD;
his muscular arm shook as he held it. The&#xD;
dog Calamity leaped to his feet and to his&#xD;
master with a low, savage howl, which he re-&#xD;
peated at intervals. This 'metamorplosis in&#xD;
the person and prestige of Nick was so 'udden&#xD;
that Pathaway was greatly surprised, as he&#xD;
had deemed the quaint trapper. incapable of&#xD;
such a manifestation.'- He no longer doubted&#xD;

"Older, older! And yet "-he spoke re-&#xD;
flectively--" you are young enough."&#xD;
"Yes, young and petted, and fit only for&#xD;
the society of boys," answered Sebastian,&#xD;
playfully.&#xD;
" Boy !" exclaimed Pathaway, " your face&#xD;
is to me a perpetual mystery, and your char-&#xD;
acter is equally bewildering. Nature made'a&#xD;
mistake .when she did not make you a iwo-&#xD;
man."&#xD;
"6I have heard that Nature never makes&#xD;
mistakes," replied the lad, laughing.&#xD;
"Though you laugh, you are still excited.&#xD;
You are panting and trembling, as if fear was&#xD;
with you an unconquerable propensity. Come,&#xD;
come, boy, be something besides a chicken ;&#xD;
for I cannot love a coward, though there are&#xD;
moments when I feel strangely attracted to&#xD;

"I only ask that you won't ridicule me,"&#xD;
Sebastian replied, curtly.&#xD;
" I should seek a different object for ridi-&#xD;
cule," returned Pathaway, somewhat piqued.&#xD;
"Ai ! look yonder. There is Nick and that&#xD;
omnipresent bear. Observe that bruin stands&#xD;
erect upon his hind feet, and disputes, seem-&#xD;
ingly, the progress of Nick."&#xD;
Sebastian looked, and beheld the object to&#xD;
which his attention had been directed. The&#xD;
bear was indeed standing strikingly straight,&#xD;
while the dog was walking suspiciously around&#xD;
it. The man and the beast confronted each&#xD;
other a short time, then the former turned to&#xD;
retrace his steps, while the latter walked lei-&#xD;
surely away.&#xD;
As the trapper approached, Pathaway&#xD;
strolled meditatively in another direction,&#xD;
Sebastian watching him earnestly as he went.&#xD;
The gray hunter was in one of those half-&#xD;
melancholy, half-complaining moods that of-&#xD;
ten visit persons of a certain temperament.&#xD;
He wished to be alone, for there are seasons in&#xD;
life when solitude is a luxury preferable to the&#xD;
allurements of human society. He felt his&#xD;
nature deeply stirred within him without know-&#xD;
ing why. The youth gave him both pain and&#xD;
pleasure-excited both admiration and con-&#xD;
tempt; yet that contempt was so modified&#xD;
with compassion, so transient in duration, and&#xD;
so seldom experienced, thatt the word express-&#xD;
ed infinitely tdo much. Sebastian was evi-&#xD;
dently a link connecting him with the past, in&#xD;
some way known to himself only. Possibly&#xD;
he possessed a face bearing similitude to one&#xD;
that had entered the charmed circle of his life&#xD;
at some period of his past history. The lad's&#xD;
skin bore the signature of two races ; one, a&#xD;
persecuted and little-eared-for race. How.&#xD;
then, could such a youth revive memories of&#xD;
former days?  Perhaps it was the extraordi-&#xD;
nary beauty of his face that pointed as an in-&#xD;
dex to the past. The true key to his feelings,&#xD;
however, at present we are only left to conjec-&#xD;
ture.&#xD;
'Proceeding to a spot where he was concealed,&#xD;
apparently, from ~human observation, he sat&#xD;
&#xD;
down upon a luxuriant carpet of grass, and&#xD;
indulged in that train of reflection that circum-&#xD;
stances had called up, the moon shedding her&#xD;
mild light around him, and a host of silvery&#xD;
stars looking down upon him through fiels&#xD;
of immeasurable space.&#xD;
CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
BILL BRACE.&#xD;
A figure working its way through the tan-&#xD;
gled grass ; a form crouching behind bushes ;&#xD;
a grim shape hiding behind rocks ; a dark&#xD;
shadowcreeping close to the earth; a head,&#xD;
now raised, now depressed ; eyes shining with&#xD;
the cunning of the mousing cat and the eager-&#xD;
ness of the hungry wolf; a strong and vindic-&#xD;
tive arm, and a hand clutching a knife.&#xD;
Bill Brace, after his combat with the gray&#xD;
hunter, had been conveyed by his compamons&#xD;
to a deserted Indian lodge in the neighbor-&#xD;
hood, to recover from his injuries ; and to&#xD;
meditate too, as it proved, on the means of re-&#xD;
taliation. It was not the nature of this hy-&#xD;
brid to forgive the man who had the nerve&#xD;
and muscle to conquer him. He considered&#xD;
it an insult that could be balanced by the life&#xD;
of his vanquisher alone-nothing else would&#xD;
be an equivalent. Bruised in body and spirit,&#xD;
lie tossed on his blanket in the lonely lotke,&#xD;
thinking more of vengeance than recovery-&#xD;
wishing for the latterly because it was ne-&#xD;
ceesary to the former. Supplied with food&#xD;
and other necessaries by his comrades, lie&#xD;
passed several days in comparative solitude;&#xD;
Ben Joice and Zenas Beck being absent most&#xD;
of the time-usually not returning till night,,,&#xD;
and not uniformly at that time. Gifted, with&#xD;
a body of iron hardihood, and an unimpaired&#xD;
constitution, a few days sufficed to put him&#xD;
upon his- feet again. Although not fully re-&#xD;
stored, and still suffering from his recent -fagel-&#xD;
lation, he commenced searching for Pathaway ;&#xD;
and discovered the new camp of Nick Whif-&#xD;
fles on the afternoon of the day upon which&#xD;
the visit was made to Trapper Valley, and&#xD;
Portneuf rescued. concealed in the bushes&#xD;
he witnessed the return of the parties ; and&#xD;
from that moment, his wrath burning with&#xD;
fresh fervor, he watched the little camp with&#xD;
tireless intensity, waiting an opportunity to ex-&#xD;
cente his sinister design. The coming and de-&#xD;
parture of Hendricks, with the attending cir-&#xD;
cumstances, produced a diversion in his favor.&#xD;
He saw, with a malignant joy known only to&#xD;
such as he, Pathaway leave Sebastian and&#xD;
Nick, and. seek the solitary spot of which muei-&#xD;
tion has been made.&#xD;
It was Bill Brace that -rouched in the grass&#xD;
-that hid behind rocks and bushes ; it was&#xD;
his burly form that crept, shadow-like, close&#xD;
to the ground ; his head that was now raised,&#xD;
now depressed; and his vengeful arm that&#xD;
held the glittering steel. How patient is&#xD;
vengeance in the pursuit of its object ; and&#xD;
how shrinking, timid, and impatient is some-&#xD;
times-virtue when engaged in the best of causes.&#xD;

&#xD;
How happens it, I wonder, that the bad pas-&#xD;
sions often burn more deeply, and possess&#xD;
more iron. energy of determination, than the&#xD;
good?&#xD;
The heart of Bill Brace beat fast with ex-&#xD;
pectation. There was a wild, malevolent ex-&#xD;
citement in his breast, as he wormed, serpent-&#xD;
like, along the earth, and drew nearer to the&#xD;
victim of his resentment. He felt that sav-&#xD;
age delight that the Indian experiences when&#xD;
he tears the scalp from his fallen enemy. It&#xD;
was fortunate for Pathaway that the - man had&#xD;
no weapon but his knife ; for the distance was&#xD;
now so short between them,.that even a pistol&#xD;
would have proved a fatal instrument in the&#xD;
practiced hand of Brace.&#xD;
lie crawled on-on hand, on knee, now bent&#xD;
like a worm, now prone on his face-seeing,&#xD;
knowing, realizing, and absorbed in but one&#xD;
thing, and that-murder ! Every sense was&#xD;
strained up-to that ; ev'ey -nerve and muscle&#xD;
was enlisted in that. 1\earer-nearer-but a&#xD;
few yards from Pathaway's back:! No noise&#xD;
had betrayed his coming : no rustle of leaves ;&#xD;
no tell-tale crackling of twigs; no careless&#xD;
striking of feet against loose stones.&#xD;
Bill Brace arose and walked upon his&#xD;
knees, with his weapon raised for the fatal&#xD;
blow! The gray hunter was still unconscious&#xD;
of danger: he sat leaning forward, his eyes&#xD;
fixed gloomily upon the ground ; his thoughts&#xD;
and fancies might have been far away. Brace&#xD;
was witln striking distance ; he threw up his&#xD;
arm vet higher-it was about to fall!&#xD;
The weapon was not fated to descend-at&#xD;
least in themanner intended.' Sebastian De-&#xD;
launay sprang between the two, and received'&#xD;
the point of the weapon in his arm. The baf-&#xD;
fled assassin turned and fled.&#xD;
Pathaway sprang to his feet-saw him bound-&#xD;
ing away, and the youth standing in the atti-&#xD;
tude in which he had received the wound : his&#xD;
right hand stretched out toward the spot where&#xD;
Brace had stood-the other held like a shield&#xD;
over Pathaway. Red drops trickled from the&#xD;
right arm and pattered upon the ground. Be-&#xD;
fore the gray hunter had time to take in the&#xD;
scene, Nick Whiffles rushed to the place, pale&#xD;
and alarmed.&#xD;
"I s'pected a p'ison diflikilty to-night, and&#xD;
it's come !" he exclaimed. " Hurt bad, ain't&#xD;
ye, little 'un ? Arm hacked most off, I s'pose.&#xD;
What did you 'magine you could do with an&#xD;
arm no bigger nor a pipe-stem ?"&#xD;
" It would seem that he has done much with&#xD;
it," answered Pathaway, who now understood&#xD;
what had happened. " He has received the&#xD;
blow intended for me, without doubt. Brave&#xD;
youth ! I hope you will forgive the injustice,&#xD;
I have done vou."&#xD;
The outstretched arms sank slowly to Se-&#xD;
bastian's side ; he tottered, and was received,&#xD;
fainting, by Nick, who hurried with him to&#xD;
camp.&#xD;
"Take off his coat," said Pathaway.&#xD;
" Not for the world ! returned Nick, hastily.&#xD;
&#xD;
" He'd take a cold that he'd never git over&#xD;
long's he lives !  I know his natur', which&#xD;
you don't-beggin' your pardon."&#xD;
In quite a flutter, Nic k cut open the sleeve of&#xD;
the boy's coat, and hurriedly commencedband-&#xD;
aging the wound. The gray hunter observed&#xD;
that ,the arm was small and delicate, and where&#xD;
not stained with blood, it was singularly white&#xD;
for a half-breed. A doubt, a vague, startling&#xD;
doubt-went floating through his brain like a&#xD;
cloud.&#xD;
Sebastian opened his eyes with a shudder and&#xD;
complained of being cold. Nick finished tMA&#xD;
dressing of the wound as if it was something&#xD;
that could not be completed with too much&#xD;
dispatch-then fastened the severed sleeve at&#xD;
the wrist. Pathaway hung over him anxiously,&#xD;
ready to render him every aid in his power ;&#xD;
but the trapper claimed the right of surgeon&#xD;
and nurse ; so that he could do lit tle else than&#xD;
express his thanks and sympathy.&#xD;
"1I'm.afraid,", said Pathaway, " that the&#xD;
bandage is too loose to check the bleeding-&#xD;
You put it on rather hastily."&#xD;
"Not at all-not at all !" answered Nick.&#xD;
"You never see a boy stop bleeding' as quick&#xD;
as he does. He can stan' cuts and bruises be-&#xD;
yond all account ; and not bruises, either, but&#xD;
euts. It's on'y eperdemies and other outrage-&#xD;
ous diseases that takes him down. Give him&#xD;
a fever, and 'twduld go pesky-hard with him,&#xD;
he's so small of his age ; for a fever requires&#xD;
so% muck room to stir about in, that a good&#xD;
'eal o' trouble might be anticipated. But this&#xD;
little diffikilty isn't nothin'."&#xD;
The youth was lying with his eyes closed,&#xD;
but Pathaway perceived that he smiled faintly&#xD;
at the remarks of Nick.&#xD;
" There's sich a healin' power in boys,"&#xD;
added Nick, watching every change in Sebas.&#xD;
tian's countenance. " I r'ally believe if you'd&#xD;
a cut my fingers and toes off at night, when&#xD;
I's ten years old, that they'd sprouted out ag'in&#xD;
by mornin'. All our family was jes' so. How&#xD;
do ye feel now, sonny ?"&#xD;
"Very well," said Sebastian.&#xD;
"The little diffikilty don't pain ye any, does&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
"No, Uncle Nicholas," answered Sabastian,&#xD;
cheerfully.&#xD;
" What did I tell ye ?" asked Nick, turning&#xD;
triumphantly tp Pathaway.&#xD;
" You are wonderful people, both," uttered&#xD;
the latter, with warmth. ." But I should feel&#xD;
grieved indeed," he added, " should this brave&#xD;
and disinterested boy suffer serious injury on&#xD;
my account. I am heartily grateful, believe&#xD;
me."                                   *&#xD;
" Sebastian's color heightened, and he was&#xD;
about to speak, when Nick stopped lim.&#xD;
" Don't trouble yourself $o answer, for I&#xD;
know how to do it better nor you. Boys never&#xD;
know what to say in sudden emergencies . The&#xD;
truth is, friend. Pathaway, he's done nothin'&#xD;

&#xD;
PATHAWAY; OR, THE D&#xD;
Bome colts. You're not old enough yet, to&#xD;
put on airs and play the veteran mountaineer.&#xD;
Boy, out o' pity for ye, I tell ye that you'd&#xD;
better go home. 'Tisn't every one I'd do .so&#xD;
much for ; but you're such a spirited grower,&#xD;
and ruffle your feathers so quick, that you&#xD;
rather 'muse me than t'otherwise. Jest take&#xD;
Nick Whiffles and leave the country, and you&#xD;
will git no harm from me."&#xD;
The outlaw leaned on his gun, and chewed&#xD;
away at his quid violently.&#xD;
"But if I choose to stay ?" queried Patha-&#xD;
way, slowly, advancing a little closer to Ilien-&#xD;
drick, andbringing his eyes to bear upon him&#xD;
at point-blank range.&#xD;
Choose !" exclaimed hendiicks, his eyes&#xD;
flaring up like half-extinguished coals, "there's&#xD;
no choice about it. When I say 'Go!' folks&#xD;
go ; they disappear and are seen here no&#xD;
more ; when I say 'Stay !' they stay.  The&#xD;
word of Captain Dick is law !"&#xD;
The ,ran drew himself up with something&#xD;
of pride and dignity.  Conscious authority&#xD;
invested him for the moment with a certain&#xD;
wild impressiveness. He had controlled his&#xD;
fellows so long and so entirely, that resistance&#xD;
to his will was a species of audacity that he&#xD;
could not endure.&#xD;
The gray hunter met his flaming looks with-&#xD;
out shrinking. As Captain Dick grew more&#xD;
impierious, lie, if possible, grew more calm&#xD;
and stronger in his self-possession.&#xD;
"Captain Dick," lie replied, with a slight'&#xD;
smile, "you, will find no subject in me. I&#xD;
neither regard your authority nor fear your&#xD;
menaces. I have heard of you ; report speaks&#xD;
badly of your character. Wicked deeds have&#xD;
been committed in the neighborhood of Trap-&#xD;
per Valley."-&#xD;
"Have you got any brains ?" asked Hen-&#xD;
dricks, turning sharply upon Pathaway, and&#xD;
attempting to quell him with the glances of&#xD;
his inflamed eyes. " Do you know the natur&#xD;
o' the critter you're dealing' with ? Perhaps&#xD;
you've got tired livin', and want to be put out&#xD;
the way ; and ag'in, you may be disordered in&#xD;
the head."&#xD;
He leered at the hunter like one whose emo-&#xD;
tions are, divided between amazement and&#xD;
wrath ; the latter, arising from  the young&#xD;
man's bold words, the other called into play&#xD;
{         by his singular self-control.&#xD;
"As to the matter of brains," answered&#xD;
Pathaway, "I believe I have nothing to ap-&#xD;
prehend in regard to quantity ; of the quality&#xD;
you shall yourself judge."&#xD;
-~  Yes, I'll examine 'em by-and-by !" rejoined&#xD;
Hendricks, touching a large pistol with the&#xD;
tip of his finger, and contracting his forehead,&#xD;
till his shaggy brows met. " I may safely&#xD;
say," he went on, with frightful humor, " that&#xD;
I'll look into 'em."&#xD;
"I shall return all your favors. Be careful&#xD;
of your fingers, Captain; they have nechani.&#xD;
calfy wandered to a weapon that is often dan-&#xD;
gerous.''&#xD;
&#xD;
MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS.                      65&#xD;
- When a man meets a prowling beast in&#xD;
the forest," replied the outlaw, with a kind of&#xD;
savage self-restraint indicative of the smother.&#xD;
ed lire burning within, "he is wise enough notto&#xD;
wantonly provoke his anger ; but-you, mister,&#xD;
are anxious to thrust your neck under his&#xD;
paws. You dropped somethin' about robbers&#xD;
and outlaws.. What did you mean ?"&#xD;
Hendricks advanced his face nearer to that&#xD;
of the young man, and flamed on him more&#xD;
fiercely with his glittering eyes.&#xD;
Pathawi y leaned forward as if willing to en-&#xD;
gage in the contest of glances.&#xD;
"You ask my meaning, nor will I long keep&#xD;
you in suspense. I ai glad of this opportu.&#xD;
nity of meeting you face to face.' 1 have&#xD;
wished such a chance for many days. By&#xD;
the phrase I made use of, I referred to such&#xD;
as you."&#xD;
" What am I ?" asked Hendricks, hoarsely.&#xD;
"An outlaw-an assassin, and the leader of&#xD;
assassins-a mountain-robber-a despoiler of&#xD;
trappers and hunters, and false alike to white&#xD;
and red men. It is a pleasure," lie continued,&#xD;
in the same unruffled manner, " to meet you&#xD;
to-day, and thrust these unwelcome truths in-&#xD;
to your face-to tell you what a scoundrel you&#xD;
are, and how richly you deserve death at the&#xD;
hands of the hangman."&#xD;
The mountaineer's tawny face bleached bo.&#xD;
fore the steady gaze of Pathaway. He was&#xD;
astounded ! Such language from one that he&#xD;
considered little else than a boy, struck him&#xD;
as something so much out of the common&#xD;
course of events that he had no reserve force of&#xD;
philosophy to meet it. He remained in a sort&#xD;
of stagnation of consternation. But his color&#xD;
flashed back presently, and with it the full&#xD;
tide of his anger.&#xD;
" Do you know what you' have done ?" he&#xD;
demanded, almost in a whisper. "Do you&#xD;
understand that you have committed suicide"&#xD;
" I know well'what I do ; I have measured&#xD;
myself and you ; and I," he added, suddenly&#xD;
straightening his person, and speaking in a&#xD;
voice that was nearly as penetrating as steel,&#xD;
"am the better man !"&#xD;
If one of the mountains before him had&#xD;
suddenly moved down to the prairies ; if the&#xD;
lake at his left had dried up, while he was&#xD;
looking at it; if the stream away at his right&#xD;
had turned and run.backward, he could not&#xD;
have evinced such blank incredulity. He&#xD;
tried to get vent in a mocking laugh that was&#xD;
like the report of a pistol.&#xD;
" I must take breath ; this chokes me up&#xD;
like a sudden cold. Wait; don't be in hurry.&#xD;
I'll kill you presently at my leisure. I heed&#xD;
fannin', critter !"&#xD;
"More than that ; you need punishment."&#xD;
" Bring the man i bring the man !" cried&#xD;
Hendricks.&#xD;
" He is here."&#xD;
" Where ?"--contemptuously.&#xD;
" Look at me, and you will see hubI " to-&#xD;
torted Pathaway, with. a piercing glands.&#xD;

&#xD;
" You---you!" muttered Hendricks, mock-&#xD;
izgly.&#xD;
"Try me I" was the quiet response.&#xD;
You'&#xD;
The two men stared silently at each other.&#xD;
The contest had already begun-in the mind;&#xD;
it had not reached the muscles. Thus far&#xD;
in the fight the gray hunter had sustained&#xD;
himself, and he was every moment growing&#xD;
firmer. His prestige was having its effect on&#xD;
Hendricks.&#xD;
When -where - how ?" asked the latter,&#xD;
eagerly.&#xD;
When-where-how you please," answered&#xD;
Pathaway, his nostrils dilating, his lips curling.&#xD;
"The weepons-the weepons?" interrogated&#xD;
the outlaw, quickly, with latent remains of&#xD;
doubt upon his face.&#xD;
'"You may choose from the whole variety&#xD;
the world affords-swivels, blunderbusses, mus-&#xD;
kets, rifles, carbines, pistols, swords, bowie-&#xD;
knives, or, if you will, the hard muscle."&#xD;
The gray hunter spoke slowly, distinctly,&#xD;
and as composedly as if discussing the ordinary&#xD;
natters of life.&#xD;
" Umn!" --&#xD;
A drop or two of the ludicrous diluted the&#xD;
ruffian's wrath. Was ever such a piece of temer-&#xD;
ity heard of! Ought he to be amused, orshould&#xD;
lie allow his resentment to rise till it ran over ?&#xD;
It was the strangest thing ! It was terribly&#xD;
presumptuous, too. But he would take his&#xD;
tine; he would show this silly, audacious boy&#xD;
what it was to provoke the sovereign of the&#xD;
mountains. He would t hurry; lie would&#xD;
hold his indignation down a space, and give&#xD;
the insulter opportunity to realize what he had&#xD;
done.&#xD;
" I don't know," lie said, doubling his&#xD;
brawny fist and thrusting it within an inch of&#xD;
Pathaway's nose, " what on airth keeps me&#xD;
from sp'ilin' the shape of your head with this&#xD;
'ere wful striker ; but I s'pose it's the same&#xD;
thing-that keeps the cat from eatin' the mouse&#xD;
till it's played with it and tossed it about with&#xD;
its paws."&#xD;
OYou haven't named the weapons, brag-&#xD;
"  =  t."&#xD;
hendricks made aprovoking grimace ; and,&#xD;
'esudenly thrusting  is arm farther forward,&#xD;
-aught the 'young man's nose between his&#xD;
tthidnb and finger. Pathaway's fist darted out&#xD;
in i straight line from his shoulder, and, Hen-&#xD;
drioks fell upon his back with a violence that&#xD;
made'his joints crack. He lay stmned an in-&#xD;
~tant, then arose, bewildered, holding his&#xD;
hands to his head, standing unsteadily. It&#xD;
appeared to the outlaw that he had never seen&#xD;
so'nany electric sparks in his life as now danced&#xD;
about before him. He was like the ox once&#xD;
felled by the axe in the shambles, which,&#xD;
sponging blindly to -his feet, in a flurry of&#xD;
n ways wildly to and fro with-depressed&#xD;
1etapd~startig'eyes..&#xD;
&#xD;
'Hendricks sat down upon the ground, and&#xD;
waited quietly for the mist to clear away. his&#xD;
face was ,very pale when he took his hands&#xD;
away and looked up at Pathaway.      The"&#xD;
stormy part of his wrath had given place to a&#xD;
deeper, more deadly feeling. His moderation&#xD;
was perfectly understood by the hunter, who,&#xD;
well acquainted with the pray o human pas-&#xD;
sions, knew what that calmness boded.&#xD;
" This, of course," he said, huskily, " must&#xD;
be answered for. 'There follers a squarin' up&#xD;
atween us. I might refuse to fight ye, and&#xD;
yet have ye in my power ; but my vengeance&#xD;
wouldn't be complete: I must punish you&#xD;
myself with my own hand. I've been summmiat&#xD;
mistaken in ye, I'll grant, which makes it&#xD;
worse for you. You took me onawares, and&#xD;
struck rigft- hard ; but the bowie-kuife will&#xD;
strike deeper, and to that weapon I hold ye."&#xD;
" Let it be so ; I accept. - I will vanquish&#xD;
you with that as I have with this."  Patha-&#xD;
way held up his clenched hand.&#xD;
Hendricks drew forth a large bowie, and af-&#xD;
ter feeling its edge, placed it on the ground&#xD;
beside him. The action, in the usual tenor of&#xD;
life's events, would have been simple and&#xD;
passed unnoticed ; but in this instance there&#xD;
was that in it to make one shrink : so much&#xD;
do the motives of man color his acts., Every-&#xD;
thing has a meaning ; and it is the meaning of&#xD;
everything that we look after.&#xD;
" don't hurry, Captain," continued. Patha-&#xD;
way. " There's time enough. If one of us&#xD;
dies between now and to-morrow morning, will&#xD;
not that be sufficiently soon ? Candidly, do&#xD;
you think either of us shall want less time&#xD;
than that for preparation ? As for you, there&#xD;
are some bad jobs on your hands that'll have&#xD;
to be accounted for. Blood, you know, is&#xD;
never silent ; it will always cry out for ven-&#xD;
geance; and try as you will, you cannot bury&#xD;
and smother it. Perhaps the Infinite Judge&#xD;
will ask you: 'Where is Portneuf, the voya-&#xD;
geur? Where is Andrew Jeanjean, the trap-&#xD;
per ?' What answer will you make, Captain&#xD;
Dick ?"&#xD;
"I see that you know too much-too much !"&#xD;
returned Hendricks, rising. "A voice like,&#xD;
yours must be stopped ; the worms must have&#xD;
cold tongue to feed on."&#xD;
Captain Dick threw his pistols upon the&#xD;
ground, unbuckled his belt, and east it from&#xD;
him.'&#xD;
" Stop a moment ! We cannot meet now&#xD;
on equal terms. I know the effect of such a&#xD;
blow as I have given you. Your limbs are&#xD;
weak; your arms have lost half their strength ;&#xD;
your eyes are unsteady. Should we engage&#xD;
as you are, I should kill you at the first pass.&#xD;
Meet me to-morrow night, just as the sun is&#xD;
setting, and your sun and it'may set at the&#xD;
same time-the first, in glory and brightness ;&#xD;
the last, in perdition and darkness."&#xD;

touch of solemnity ; they were like 'the voice&#xD;

~ "To-morrow night, as the sun is setting, I&#xD;
will meet you on this level with a single wea-&#xD;
pon, and that shall'be this."  The hunter&#xD;
touched the bowie-knife at his belt.&#xD;
The outlaw stood scowling a few moments,&#xD;
then said :&#xD;
"Let it be to-night-to-night !"&#xD;
"To-night be it. Do not doubt me ; with-&#xD;
out fail I will be here. God help him that&#xD;
falls! and that will be you!"&#xD;
"I doubt whether to trust you," said Hen-&#xD;
dricks, fingering his shaggy beard, while his&#xD;
lawless spirit cheafed within him like a caged&#xD;
beast to which captivity is irksome.&#xD;
"Will you come alone ?" he asked, suspi-&#xD;
ciously.&#xD;
'Alone," replied Pathaway. " And you ?"&#xD;
" Shall need no witness," added Hendricks,&#xD;
fiercely, as if completing the hunter's last sen-&#xD;
tence.&#xD;
" You are not over-scrupulous, Captain&#xD;
Dick, and taking your word is more danger-&#xD;
ous than meeting you. Keep away your 'fel-&#xD;
lows; I shall be watching-I shall be well&#xD;
assured on that point. Some men can be&#xD;
trusted ; you are not of that kind. Do I strike&#xD;
well, Captain ?"&#xD;
The grey hunter smiled derisively, while'&#xD;
Hendricks' brow was knit into a score of&#xD;
wrinkles.&#xD;
"'Twas a foul blow, and shall prove the dear-&#xD;
est you ever struck ! Enjoy your triumph,&#xD;
critter, and don't think to sneak away 'thout&#xD;
.hearin' ag'in from Cap'n Dick. If you hope&#xD;
 to give me the slip, you'll be disapp'inted ;&#xD;

with a sardonic laugh, " for a rifle ball will do&#xD;
our business jest as well, and save me trou-&#xD;
le. At sunset, youngster,'at sunset'!"&#xD;
My memory is good," returned Patha-&#xD;
way. " Adieu, valorous Captain, till then."&#xD;
The trapper-outlaw walked a short distance,&#xD;
then looking over his shoulder, muttered :&#xD;
"There'll be one cock the less to crow in&#xD;
the mornin' !"&#xD;
A laugh expressive of his malignancy and&#xD;
humiliation accompanied this remark-a start-&#xD;
ling, unnatural sound rattling up from the&#xD;
chest, like the threatening growl of an animal.&#xD;
Pathawa made no answer, but turned his&#xD;
face toward Nick Whiffle's camp.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVIL&#xD;
THE DUEL.&#xD;
The departing sunlight lay in horizontal&#xD;
beams upon the earth, quivering like long&#xD;
tongues of fire upon the grass. The descend-'&#xD;
ing orb never looked more like a deity worthy&#xD;
the worship of man.  It sank with golden&#xD;
majesty below the western verge.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pathaway stood on the grassy level where&#xD;
he had met Hendricks. Twilight fell like a&#xD;
far-stretching, vapory cloud, wrapping every&#xD;
object in a shadowy mantle. That inipressivo&#xD;
silence that sometimes follows the dyinIg day,&#xD;
rested upon the spot. The leaves hung mo-&#xD;
tionless upon the trees, and the long spires of&#xD;
grass stood still and stirless. The quietude&#xD;
spoke to the heart of the young man 9s with&#xD;
a voice. His finer sympathies held commun-&#xD;
ion with Nature, and recognized her noiseless&#xD;
footsteps around him.&#xD;
He stood with folded arms looking toward&#xD;
the slope where he was in momentary expect-&#xD;
ancy of seeing Hendricks ; and that person-&#xD;
age presently appeared. He soon reached the&#xD;
level.&#xD;
" I have waited you," said Pathaway, as the&#xD;
trapper-outlaw drew near. "I feared you had&#xD;
thought it best to forget this appointment."&#xD;
" I .have come to fight, not to talk !" re-&#xD;
torted Hendricks, gruffly.&#xD;
" You shall be satisfied, Captain Dick."&#xD;
The parties laid aside their belts and pis-&#xD;
tols. Hendricks threw off his hunting shirt,&#xD;
displaying an arm bare and brawny.&#xD;
"The terms of this duel-" began the gray&#xD;
hunter.&#xD;
" Are to the victor life, to the vanquished&#xD;
death !" interposed Hendricks.&#xD;
" I expected as much, and came fully pre-&#xD;
pared for such terms." The hunter took off&#xD;
his gray frock, but without bluster or any at-&#xD;
tempt at effect;. his chest was full and round-&#xD;
ed, his arms shapely, yet without uncommon&#xD;
development of muscle. His antagonist ob-&#xD;
served him with dogged curiosity and impa-&#xD;
tient and insolent eagerness,,as if already as-&#xD;
sured of victory, and unwilling to delay it.&#xD;
Pathaway was pale, and a change had grad-&#xD;
ually taken place in his expression; his eyes&#xD;
were blazing with a light that Hendricks had&#xD;
not before seen in them. He grasped his&#xD;
weapon, and the two regarded each other war-&#xD;
ily ; then Hendricks sprang forward, and their&#xD;
blades met. A sharp and angry clamor rang&#xD;
through the air, disturbing the soft repose of&#xD;
the spot. It soon became apparent that Cap-&#xD;
tain Dick was resolved to make the contest, a&#xD;
short one, and end it by a bold and vigorous&#xD;
onset. He wielded the terrible instrument he&#xD;
had chosen with, great skill and rapidity; it&#xD;
waved on every side like lightning, and on every&#xD;
side met opposing steel. His fierce lunges at&#xD;
the hunter's breast were turned away as with&#xD;
a shield of iron.&#xD;
Pathaway acted on the defensive only, now&#xD;
retreating, now leaping nimbly to the right or&#xD;
left, now warding a blow from his face, now&#xD;
from his neck, chest, side, and limbs, perform-&#xD;
ing all these feats with an ease and adroitness&#xD;
that proved him equal to the emergency.&#xD;
Captain Dick perceived that he.was spend-&#xD;
'ing his strength in vain, and suspended his&#xD;
furious assaults to take breath. Pathaway si.&#xD;

&#xD;
gently awaited the, renewal of the combat ;&#xD;
but it was not difficult to see that he was be-&#xD;
couing interested in the terrible game. The&#xD;
outlaw's first confidence was gone ; and to lose&#xD;
shad in such a trial, is to lose much. Victory&#xD;
is half won, when one does not doubt himself.&#xD;
Doubt is the enemy of success.&#xD;
H*idricks advanced to continue the contest&#xD;
with much more cautiousness and much less&#xD;
assurance. Pathaway now began to press him,&#xD;
and to exhibit a skill and quickness that cowed&#xD;
the impetuosity of his antagonist, and 'made&#xD;
his ruffian heart beat fast with apprehension.&#xD;
" I have you, captain I" said Pathaway, with&#xD;
startling emphasis. " You are mine-I am&#xD;
your master !"&#xD;
Hendricks' weapon flew from his hand into&#xD;
the air, falling on the grass at some distance ;&#xD;
he stood before the hunter,unarmed, and pant.&#xD;
panting like an overworked ox. Pathaway&#xD;
stood with his knife pointed at his breast,&#xD;
emern, firm, and threatenin  as a minister of&#xD;
vengeance. The color faded from Hendricks'&#xD;
face, and he seemed to feel already the 'touch&#xD;
of death. As they confronted each other, the&#xD;
one with a proud glow of triumph, the other&#xD;
with wild consternation, the voice of a woman&#xD;
arrested the hand of Pathaway, and almost in-&#xD;
stantly a female form was interposed between&#xD;
him a'ud Hendricks.&#xD;
" Hold !" she cried. " Would you kill an.&#xD;
unarmed man-? It is me that you strike when&#xD;
you strike him."&#xD;
Pathaway looked at the face that was turn-&#xD;
ed rebukingly upon him, and recognized the&#xD;
young woman that Portneuf had called Car-&#xD;
6ta. 'ie drew back, and answered, gracefully:&#xD;
" For your sake I spare him, though his life,&#xD;
by the terms of our meeting, is forfeit to me."&#xD;
" And what good would his life do you ?"&#xD;
asked Carl6th.&#xD;
" Ask Portneuf, or Andrew Jeanjean that&#xD;
lquestiod," answered the hunter, sternly.&#xD;
" Your meaning is dark," said Carl6ta,&#xD;
changing color.&#xD;
" So was the trapper's grave in the lonely&#xD;
cai on !" retorted Pathaway, with a searching&#xD;
look.&#xD;
Carldta put her hand to her brow dubiously,&#xD;
gazing fixedly at the hunter, whose counte-&#xD;
nance appeared to fascinate her.&#xD;
" Hush ! hush ! no more. You are trifling&#xD;
withthat-with that which you ought to val-&#xD;
ne," responded Carldta, quickly, and with&#xD;
earnestness. A warning glance accompanied&#xD;
this remark.&#xD;
- "Believe me, young woman, I shall put no&#xD;
restraint upon my tongue while truth compels&#xD;
me to speak, and my arm is able to make good&#xD;
my words. I said tiat this ruffian's life was&#xD;
forfeit to me ; it is, and, not to me alone, but&#xD;
to the law ; for law reaches'to every country,&#xD;
however remote from the great centres of civ-&#xD;
ilization. The presence of human beings&#xD;
makes law even in the wilderness."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Foolhardy young man!" answered Carl6ta,&#xD;
" I would have given your-own: life for his, and&#xD;
you must attribute what may happen to your&#xD;
imprudence."&#xD;
Cari6ta waved'her hard, and immediately a&#xD;
score of men arose front the grass and bushes.&#xD;
Pathaway was instantly surrounded by a set&#xD;
of fellowswho would have graced the deck of&#xD;
a pirate-ship. The outlaw-trapper laughed&#xD;
triumphantly, for the vision of sudden death&#xD;
had passed. Men grow brave after danger,&#xD;
and lawless passion is insolent. We oscillate&#xD;
like pendulums from one idea to another. The&#xD;
cheek that is now pale with terror will soon be&#xD;
flushed with pride. Sudden deliverance often&#xD;
produces a revulsion that reaches to the very&#xD;
extreme of opposite emotion.&#xD;
Hendricks was now disposed to, abuse his&#xD;
power, forgetful of the clemency of.his con-&#xD;
queror. Pathaway, however much disturbed&#xD;
inwardly, maintained his composure, quietly&#xD;
pat on his coat, and while doing so, dexterously&#xD;
managed to conceal his knife about his person.&#xD;
" Well, miss or madam," he said, with some&#xD;
bitterness, " I seem to be your prisoner. ~ At&#xD;
your request, I spared the life of this burly&#xD;
ruffian. What reward shall I receive for my&#xD;
gallantry ?"&#xD;
Pathaway, as he stood erect in his manly&#xD;
beauty, was an object of no ordinary interest&#xD;
to the girl Carldta ; and lie, in turn, did not&#xD;
look upon her without curiosity mingled with&#xD;
pity. What was her history? What wayward&#xD;
ate had given her such a life ? What imper-&#xD;
ative -circumstances had shaped her course,&#xD;
making her the friend, companion, accomplice,&#xD;
and leader of outlaws ?e, I thought, as every&#xD;
man does when lie sees a misdirected woman,&#xD;
what she might have been under different au-&#xD;
spices.&#xD;
" A little spot of earth somewhere near&#xD;
Trapper Trace !" she, replied, in a low voice,&#xD;
stud ying his features.&#xD;
"It's what we shall all want," muttered&#xD;
Pathaway.          -&#xD;
" Critter, it's what some won't want long !"&#xD;
said Hendricks, with vindictiveness.&#xD;
"I don't know-I don't know, Captain&#xD;
Dick," responded the hunter, looking signifi-&#xD;
cantly around him. "I have seen those whose&#xD;
bodies will at last rest in air."&#xD;
" You count on our bein' hanged ; but sich&#xD;
a thing won't be in your day. If any on us&#xD;
ever come to the halter, it'll be arter you are&#xD;
past seem' the sight." oThen to his men:&#xD;
"Critters, form ! Set your faces toward Trap-&#xD;
per Trace, and keep a sharp look-out for this&#xD;
pork-eater. By-the-way, lads, that confounded&#xD;
Frenchman got-clear in some way ; found him&#xD;
last night, or his ghost, at Nick Whiffles' camp.&#xD;
'Twon't do to make another sich bunglin' job&#xD;
as that. Go ahead, boys, go ahead ! Carl6ta,&#xD;
you come in the nick o' time. You see I was-&#xD;
taken dizzy of a sudden, and this critter took&#xD;
advantage on't."-&#xD;
&#xD;
-A smile flitted over Pathaways lips. Some&#xD;
of the men shrugged their shoulders and leered&#xD;
at each other.&#xD;
The parties were soon in motion. Ascend-&#xD;
ing the hill. surrounded by his captors, the&#xD;
gray hunter, to his surprise, saw horses enough&#xD;
to mount them all in the valley on the other&#xD;
side. The outlaw trappers had left them there,&#xD;
in order that their fhrther advance might be&#xD;
less conspicuous. In a short-time, thev'were&#xD;
all in the saddle. Pathaway found hiimself&#xD;
riding beside CarhSta.  He had never been&#xD;
placed in a position so peculiar, and one so'&#xD;
well calculated to awaken serious reflection.&#xD;
The night had fully set in ; but it was not so&#xD;
dark but he could see very well the person of&#xD;
his companion. She was dressed as he had&#xD;
seen her on the previous day. Of her face&#xD;
and figure he was able to form a more accu-&#xD;
rate judgment. That she was physically gifted&#xD;
by nature, lie was not long in perceiving. Her&#xD;
swelling bust aid rounded arms were fine spe-&#xD;
cimens of developed womanhood ; while her&#xD;
figure generally, indicated litheness and activ-&#xD;
ity. Her light-brown hair was kept in place&#xD;
by a velvet band, but was allowed to flow in&#xD;
curls upon her neck and shoulders. Her fea-&#xD;
tures were regular, but strongly marked, and&#xD;
possessed of a wild and daring beauty. Her&#xD;
eyes were darker than her hair, exceedingly&#xD;
quick and penetrating. She sat her horse as&#xD;
if she had been accustomed to the saddle from-&#xD;
childhood. She controlled her beast with a&#xD;
firm, strong hand, and rode as fearlessly as any&#xD;
of her lawless followers. Pathaway noticed&#xD;
her particularly ; for he was desirous to know&#xD;
if he could base hopes of escape upon her wo-&#xD;
manly instincts.&#xD;
" This is a strange life for one of your sex,"&#xD;
said the gray, hunter, watching her counte-&#xD;
nance, to see if it gave any indication of the&#xD;
qualities which would operate in his favor.&#xD;
"And yours, perhaps, appears strange to me.&#xD;
What other life can be so free ?" she answered,&#xD;
with a sharp pull at her bridle-rein.&#xD;
" Free indeed ! too free-too free !" returned&#xD;
Pathaway.&#xD;
" From your point of view, yes ; but people&#xD;
have to be just what their surroundings make&#xD;
them."&#xD;
She glanced at the hunter inquiringly,,who,&#xD;
leaning toward her, replied :&#xD;
" The surroundings must be bad that force&#xD;
one of your sex to become what you appear&#xD;
to be.",&#xD;
"What kind of a creature do you consider&#xD;
me ?" she asked, petulantly.         ,&#xD;
" A misdirected woman-the accomplice of&#xD;
crime and robbery."&#xD;
" You are plain-spoken, sir !" retorted Car-&#xD;
l6ta, tartly.&#xD;
"Do not mince matters ; it is too late to be&#xD;
dainty in regard to the character of the solitary&#xD;
and predatory horde of which you are a mem-&#xD;
ber. Look at these fellows around you; they&#xD;
&#xD;
are lawless and intractable as Indians ; faith-&#xD;
less as the wandering Arabs of the desert."&#xD;
" I care not to talk of this subject. There&#xD;
are other matters that might employ your&#xD;
thoughts more profitably."&#xD;
"I understand you. You would say that I&#xD;
should be thinking of dying, and what comes&#xD;
after death. Believe me. my life has not been&#xD;
so bad that I need to trouble with late remorse&#xD;
And after all," he added, "it is not wanly to&#xD;
whine and lament at the approach of man's&#xD;
last enemy. I speak sincerely, for I doubt not&#xD;
that my end is near ; and with you, woman,&#xD;
will lie the c'ime of my murder."&#xD;
"CLou talk coolly of a subject that generally&#xD;
pales the cheek of the stoutest," responuicd&#xD;
Carluta.&#xD;
"My own will be pale, questionless, when&#xD;
that hour arrives-; but I trust it will not he&#xD;
with coivard fear, but that wholesome awe&#xD;
which will fall upon one as he enters the por-&#xD;
tals of that other world of which this is the&#xD;
threshold."&#xD;
" We who dwell in the mountains know of&#xD;
but one world. There-there ! let us not speak&#xD;
together farther. I wish not to have other than&#xD;
accustomed thoughts. I would think of my&#xD;
horse, of the mountains and prairies, of a wild&#xD;
and irresponsible life of freedom."&#xD;
Carl6ta pointed toward her companions, and&#xD;
added:&#xD;
." We are a community by ourselves -ai&#xD;
world by .ourselves ; we make our own laws,&#xD;
and acknowledge fealty to no outside legis-&#xD;
lation. I know that the world is very large, and&#xD;
there are many dwellers in it; but they are&#xD;
strangers to me, and I to them."&#xD;
" But that is no good reason why you should&#xD;
become beasts of prey." said Pathaway, with&#xD;
earnestness.&#xD;
" It is a law of Nature;" Carl6ta continued,&#xD;
emphatically, "'that one animal should live at&#xD;
the expense of another. The fish in the water,&#xD;
the beasts in the forest, the birds in the air,&#xD;
devour each other. The spider weaves its web&#xD;
to catch the unsuspecting fly ; the panther&#xD;
crouches in his covert to spring upon the deer ;&#xD;
the hawk swoops down ulpot the chicken ; and&#xD;
following the great law of Nature, manpreys&#xD;
upon man. Why should we scorn the teacli-&#xD;
ings of Nature ? How shall we resist the mo-&#xD;
mentum which she has given to all animate&#xD;
,things. Even vegetable life flourishes best&#xD;
upon the decay of last year's growth."&#xD;
Carldta's face flushed, and a wild enthusiasm&#xD;
beamed from every feature. Pathaway gazed&#xD;
at her in mute ast nishment.&#xD;
" Is it possin.e I is it possible !" he mur-&#xD;
mured. " Can a mind so gifted be so perverted.&#xD;
Whence this knowled c-this flowing speech-&#xD;
this aptness of simile-this command of lan-&#xD;
guage? Woman," he went on, addressing her&#xD;
in a regretful tone, "you make me inexpres-&#xD;

"And I," rejoined Carl6ta, bitterly, "am the  " What part of your territory may we now be&#xD;

"And I, it would appear, your lawful prey.  " The trail we are traveling is called Trap-&#xD;

ground without such aid. Looking around,&#xD;
he beheld frowns on the faces of half-a-dozen&#xD;
surly fellows, and Hendricks himself scowled,&#xD;
as if little pleased with the familiarity of his&#xD;
prisoner.&#xD;
"Shall I not hear from-shall I not see you&#xD;
again ?" Pathaway asked, in a whisper.&#xD;
Carlota made no nnser; but holding up&#xD;
her habit daintily, disappeared in one of the&#xD;
huts. He gazed after her earnestly, as if his&#xD;
last hope had vanished with her.&#xD;
"Go along, critter!" growled Hendricks,&#xD;
pushing him in the direction of a hut that&#xD;
seemed stronger than the others. "There's&#xD;
no help fur ye now. If you'd minded your&#xD;
own consarns and let us alone, there'd been no&#xD;
trouble ; but you've seen fit to act as spy and&#xD;
look arter matters- with which you'd no right&#xD;
to meddle nor make. You and Nick Whifflies&#xD;
have been sneakin' about this-'ng time ; and&#xD;
in my 'pinion, had something' to do with the&#xD;
escape o#' the Frenchman.    Perhaps yon&#xD;
thought I didn't know him when I see him&#xD;
last night at Nick's hut ?"&#xD;
"I knew that something, terrified you,'. an-&#xD;
swered Pathaway.&#xD;
"'Tis false ! I was never afeard !" retorted&#xD;
Hendricks, angrily.&#xD;
{cI saw you staring at the empty air as if&#xD;
you saw a ghost," said Pathaway, resolved to&#xD;
try an experiment.&#xD;
"That's a lie, too ; for I's lookin' at the boy !"d&#xD;
"Boy !" repeated the hunter, with affected&#xD;
surprise.&#xD;
"1Yes, the handsome boy,"  dded-Captain&#xD;
Dick, with an inquiring loo.&#xD;
Pathaway shook his head dubiously.&#xD;
"You must have seen what the rest of us&#xD;
did not," lie said, with a perplexed air._&#xD;
"Bali! do you think I'm blind ? I saw him&#xD;
as plainly as I see you. Don't fool with me,&#xD;
mister ; for I ha'n't much patience, and don't&#xD;
bear contradiction very well when I can have&#xD;
things my own way."&#xD;
"I'm afraid you have a bad ednscience, Cap-&#xD;
tain Hendricks," said Pathaway, reflectively.&#xD;
"Bad consciences createa thousand fantastic&#xD;
shapes in the minds of wicked men. However,&#xD;
I am not your judge ; and I dare say bt too&#xD;
many things are real that appear to inc illuso-&#xD;
 ry. You know best whom you have injured,&#xD;

the hollow sounds that came from his throat.&#xD;
To save his character for courage, thowever,lhe&#xD;
let oft a volley of oaths ; in spite of which his&#xD;
face was pale and his terror obvious.&#xD;
" Go in, critter," lie added, pointing to the&#xD;
.hut, " and don't play off on me. As for&#xD;
wrongin' a boy of his age, I never did. Do&#xD;
von think we're land-pirates, that we must,'&#xD;

", can't comprehend you, Captain Hen-&#xD;
drieks," answered the hunter, impressively.&#xD;
&#xD;
The devil you can't !" cried the captain,&#xD;
furiously.&#xD;
"fI have heard," resumed Pathaway, with a&#xD;
shiver, "that murdered people can't rest. I&#xD;
don't make the remark as having any allusion&#xD;
to you, Captain; but doubtless you hav e heard&#xD;
the sanie. It does, in truth, seen just that&#xD;
the ghosts of the murdered should dog their&#xD;
murderers day and iight, and give them no&#xD;
pence. Some have been thus driven to con-&#xD;
fess crime, and cast themselves into the teeth&#xD;
of that terrible monster, LAW-that grim dra-&#xD;
gon that devours without remorse."&#xD;
"No more sich trumpery stuff!" exclaimed&#xD;
hendricks. "No sensible person believes in&#xD;
ghosts. When a man dies, that's the last of&#xD;
him ; and I'm glad- on't. What kind of a life&#xD;
do you s'pose a eritter'd lead carter he'd rubbed&#xD;
out a man or two in skrimmages or t'other-&#xD;
wise, if their ghosts could come back ag'in,&#xD;
looking' as pleas death, with eyes fixed and&#xD;
glassy."&#xD;
"'la .afraid it's too true!" said Pathaway,&#xD;
in a low voice. "I had the misfortune to kill&#xD;

iunly, "I won't leave ine ; it follows, follows,&#xD;

dric s. "Here, Jack ; take care of this feller&#xD;
till morning . If you let him  git away, I'll&#xD;
string you up higher'a Haman!"&#xD;
sr this time Pathaway was in the hut, and&#xD;
the person called arose from the floor, where&#xD;
he hd been sleeping.&#xD;
"'Tend to business now, Jack, and rub your&#xD;
eyes arterwards," added the captain. " Here's&#xD;
a spy i' critter that's goin' to step out afore&#xD;
the sun sets ag'in, and I want you to keep a&#xD;
shar seye on hi till he's wanted."&#xD;
"Jest as you say, Cap'n-" grunted Jack.&#xD;
estHas lie got any, weeoies about him ?" he&#xD;
asked, stirring the fire that was burning in the&#xD;
centre of the hut.&#xD;
"cYou can see for yourself thathe's got&#xD;
nothin' but his hands," replied Hendricks.&#xD;
nout if you're afraid you can't keep him with&#xD;
your pistols and your gun, call up one or two&#xD;
of the boys to help."&#xD;
"Why don't you do for him to-nmght, and&#xD;
that'll save the trouble of watchin'?- It's very&#xD;
simple-a half-ounce o' lead, you know."&#xD;
Do as I tell ye !" answered Hendricks,&#xD;
sharply, and without stopping to parley longer&#xD;
with his subordinate, walked aw.av.&#xD;
The fire flared up brightly. Wiiey looked at&#xD;
the face of his prisoner. It's you, is it ?" he&#xD;
said. "Seed you with that tall hunter and the&#xD;

" 1 don't despair entirely."&#xD;

The gray hunter glanced at Wiley, to see i&#xD;
there was compassion in his 'face ; but it was&#xD;
as sombre as the walls of the hut.&#xD;
"You look like an honest man, Mr. Wiley ?'&#xD;
" But I ain't;' I'm a scoundrel ! I don't&#xD;

him.&#xD;

that sum beyond the mountains, where, instead&#xD;
of a haunting shadow of a felon's death, you&#xD;
shall have peace and security. Contrast that&#xD;
with your present condition."&#xD;
" Does freedom go for nothin', eh ?"&#xD;
" Does your neckgo for nothing ?" returned&#xD;
Pathaway. " Can you sleep without dreaming&#xD;
of halters ? Is it not better to feel like an&#xD;
honest man than like a rogue ? Were I in&#xD;
your place, Jack Wiley, I should strangle in&#xD;
my dreams."&#xD;
" But you won't ! you'll strangle wide awake !&#xD;
Uh !" -&#xD;
Wiley yawned, and looked sleepily at the&#xD;
hunter.&#xD;
" It's all very pooty," he added ; " but you&#xD;
can't go I Why can't ye ? 'Cause you can't!"&#xD;
" You don't talk like a man of sense. You&#xD;
speak -like one whose brain 'is muddled with&#xD;
liquor. What greater freedom do you want,&#xD;
than the freedom of the whole civilized world,&#xD;
with money in your purse and a good coat to&#xD;
your back ?"&#xD;
" You don't understand me at all, Mr. Patha-&#xD;
way, nor how a mountaineer likes the life he's&#xD;
a)lers been used to. What could a rough fel-&#xD;
ler like me do lown in the settlements ? What&#xD;
would Jack Wiley be good for, there ? . Who'd1&#xD;
think anything of him, eh ? Could he wear&#xD;
rat-skin gloves, and stiff hats, and shiny boots?&#xD;
Could he go into drawin'-rooms any more nor&#xD;
a grizzlf bear ? Would anybody tike off their&#xD;
hat~ to him ? No ; they'd laugh, and say :&#xD;
' There comes a wild varmint from the moun-&#xD;
tains ! That 'd be minhty fine, wouldn't it?&#xD;
I could stan' that, couldn't I ?. Wah! wal l!"&#xD;
"Not so bad as that," 'replied Pathaway,&#xD;
&#xD;
considerably staggered  by this argument.&#xD;
" One soon  learns the ways of civilized&#xD;
f life."&#xD;
" No civilization for me ! Give me the Nor'-&#xD;
west and the red Ingin beauties, and I'm satis-&#xD;
fied. None o' your pale, sickly lqokin' white&#xD;
squaws for Jaek Wiley ; there's no sweetness&#xD;
in sich; it's bleached out of 'em by the clear-&#xD;
in's. The brown beauties forever ! So don't&#xD;
talk no more. You're in for it and can't&#xD;
help it ; so make up your mind, and hang like&#xD;
a reasonable being . What's the use botlierin'&#xD;
me ? Want to get me into a scrape, I s'pose ?&#xD;
The captain is a devil of a feller when he's&#xD;
disapp'inted, and the distance is long that 'd&#xD;
prevent his findin' me if I should play him a&#xD;
trick. When you go a swimmin' in cold water,&#xD;
you musn't stan' shiverin' on the bank, but&#xD;
plunge right in, and it's all over in an instant.&#xD;
It's jes' sc with hangin'."&#xD;
" I hoped," said Pathaway, regretfully,&#xD;
" that you had a heart, to be touched by the&#xD;
misfortunes of a fellow-creature, but perceive&#xD;
that I wab mistaken. I was about to offer you&#xD;
a thousand dollars for freedom."&#xD;
"A thousand dollars !" repeated Jack, slow-&#xD;
ly. " That's a right smart pile, mister.&#xD;
There's a good many drunken frolics in a thou-&#xD;
sand dollars-a tearin' visit to Selkirk or Mon-&#xD;
treal."&#xD;
",A thousand, in gold !" added the hunter.&#xD;
"Do you happen to have it about ye ?"&#xD;
asked Wiley, with a quick look.&#xD;
"Thank Heaven, no ! I'm not so silly a&#xD;
fish. If I had so much money on my person,&#xD;
I should be wise enough to keep it to myself.&#xD;
I would not offer a reward for my own mur-&#xD;
der, by proclaiming such a fact. Therecyou&#xD;
look more comfortable now ; you startled m&#xD;
a moment ago by the eagerness of your eyes.&#xD;
I have not sufficient money in my pocket to&#xD;
buy a pint of your beloved beverage, whisky;&#xD;
but I know where to find it, Jack."&#xD;
" Don't bother ! lay down and go to sleep,&#xD;
so that .your narves ma  be 'strong in the&#xD;
mornin'. I'm not the kind o' bird' that's&#xD;
ketched with salt or chaff."&#xD;
" Well, have your own way," said Pathaway,&#xD;
sternly. " That bullet head of yours willrun&#xD;

Jack, with brutal indifference. "You'll be up&#xD;

PATHAWAY ; OR, THE&#xD;
crowning and last pain of human life, with all'&#xD;
its after revelations.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
CARLOTA.&#xD;
Persons in positions.of danger are prone to,&#xD;
think of the good and evil of their lives, and&#xD;
to draw a balance in favor of one-or the other.&#xD;
Pathaway did not attempt a very nice adjust-&#xD;
ment of his moral accounts ; but felt, as all&#xD;
right-thinking men do in seasons of extremity,&#xD;
genuine regret that his life had been so barren&#xD;
of results, and so little productive of happi-&#xD;
ness to others. Because he indulged in re-&#xD;
flections of this kind, he did not abandon all&#xD;
hope of escape, but revolved many plans, in&#xD;
his mind.&#xD;
Wiley maintained his position near the en-&#xD;
trance of the hut, with his weapons ostenta-&#xD;
tiously paraded beside him ; but the man was&#xD;
heavy with sleep. Ilis recent visit to the&#xD;
world of dreams, and his sudden recall by&#xD;
Captain Hendricks, had left a lethargy upon&#xD;
his brain that continually urged him to a re-&#xD;
lapse into the same oblivious state. His first&#xD;
nap was to him like the first glass of the ine-&#xD;
briate-giving him a strong inclination to a&#xD;
second. But he had a duty to perform which&#xD;
it would be dangerous to neglect. Mentally,&#xD;
he firmly determined that sleep should not&#xD;
close his eyelids till he was relieved of his&#xD;
charge. To keep the invidious enemy at&#xD;
arm's length, he arose and stood upon his&#xD;
feet ; tiring of that position, and feeling forti-&#xD;
fied against surprise, he resumed his seat and&#xD;
smoked-stealing, without seeming to do so,&#xD;
frequent glances at his prisoner, to see if he&#xD;
would not so far forget his troubles as to yield&#xD;
to the soothing power of slumber; for it ap-&#xD;
peared to him that a sleeping man was more&#xD;
easily guarded than one wide awake.&#xD;
-As the night wore on, the gray hunter seem-&#xD;
ed disposed to accommodate his keeper ; his&#xD;
head gradually sank upon the floor, and his&#xD;
respiration was certainly indicative of slumber.&#xD;
Jack rejoiced at this, and .though resolutely&#xD;
bent upon wakefulness, naturally employed&#xD;
less effort to maintain that condition. .Ie be-&#xD;
gan to nod, but had at first frequent brighten-&#xD;
ings-up ; the latter grew less frequent, until&#xD;
his chin rested upon his chest, and he was&#xD;
fairly conquered. It was when his heavy&#xD;
breathing gave notice of this fact, that Patha-&#xD;
way's eyes unclosed. The sleep was genuine ;&#xD;
there was no mistaking it. Pathaway raised&#xD;
himself upon his elbow, in effecting which his&#xD;
foot unintentionally came in contact with a&#xD;
fagot, making a slight noise that was sufficient&#xD;
to startle the. sentinel, who .straightened up&#xD;
galvanically and yawned. Pathaway fell back&#xD;
to his former position, and Jack, having an in-&#xD;
distinct consciousness that all was right, was&#xD;
overpowered again in aninstant. There's no-&#xD;
thing one covets so much as sleep when it is&#xD;
forbidden; it becomes a thing inexpressibly&#xD;
&#xD;
MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS.                      .68&#xD;
desirable, and to Wiley it was more-irresisti-&#xD;
ble.&#xD;
Warned by his previous experiment, the&#xD;
prisoner acted with greater carefulness and&#xD;
quickness. As if by a single movement, he&#xD;
was on his feet and advancing upon Wiley,&#xD;
who, unfortunately for the former, carried into&#xD;
his dreams a wholesome fear of the wrath of&#xD;
Captain Hendricks. Pathaway was not con-&#xD;
scious that he made the slightest poise ; but&#xD;
something warned his watcher of danger-his&#xD;
instincts or his previously whetted sensibilities&#xD;
-for he sprang up like an automaton operated&#xD;
by springs, yet too late for successful resist-&#xD;
ance ; for the hand of the young man was at&#xD;
his throat before he could grasp a weapon.&#xD;
He bore him to the ground, and the fellow felt&#xD;
fingers of steel upon his mouth before he could&#xD;
give the alarm, and knees planted like"iron&#xD;
posts upon his chest.&#xD;
"Be silent !" said Pathaway. "One sound&#xD;
from your lips seals your fate. Mind what I&#xD;
say ! It is with me a matter of life and death ;&#xD;
and if necessity calls for it, I shall not hesitate&#xD;
to sacrifice you as I would a beast of prey I"&#xD;
Pathaway took his hand from Viley's mouth,&#xD;
and drew a bowie that he had concealed at his&#xD;
back, between his hunting-frock and person.&#xD;
The brightness of the blade dazzled the eyes&#xD;
of the outlaw, and was the strongest argument&#xD;
for his silence that could have been employed.&#xD;
Jack knew his man; he saw his nerve, his&#xD;
power, his quickness of action, his firmness of&#xD;
purpose, at a glance ; it was revealed to him&#xD;
by the blazing light in his eyes. He would&#xD;
have spoken and said: .I give up! .  give&#xD;
up !" but could not, for the metallic fin-&#xD;
gers pressed him to suffocation. , He made a&#xD;
consenting movement of the head, and the&#xD;
hunter relaxed the rigor of his grasp.&#xD;
" For God's sake, don't kill me !" he gasped.&#xD;
"Your life," answered Pathaway, " depends&#xD;
entirely on your obedience. Open your mouth&#xD;
---you must be= gagged."&#xD;
Wiley wished to remonstrate, but deadly&#xD;
fear kept him mute. He obeyed the imperious&#xD;
order with a helpless, humiliated reluctance&#xD;
that needed no interpreter.   The - hunter&#xD;
crowded in without ceremony a large piece of&#xD;
buckskin, cut from the ruffian's own hunting-&#xD;
frock. There was no feminine delicacy or&#xD;
softness about the operation ; it was prompt,&#xD;
rough, and efficacious.&#xD;
1" Turn'upon your faceI" said Pathaway,&#xD;
withdrawing his weight fromhis chest.&#xD;
With a sullen rattling in his thrott--the new&#xD;
application was too thoroughly made to pro-&#xD;
duce anything but an uncomfortable sense of&#xD;
strangulation-Wiley -rolled over, *hen the&#xD;
hunter cut two stout strips from the back of&#xD;
the garment that had already contributed to&#xD;
his convenience, with one of which he.tied his&#xD;
wrists, while the other performed the same of-&#xD;
fice for his feet. It was not an emergency that&#xD;
allowed of being careful -about trifles, and it&#xD;

"Come from white squaw ; show pale face&#xD;

"Carl6ta' sent you," said Pathaway, quite&#xD;

" Joe tell you once ; no tell same thing&#xD;

Perceiving that his guide was not disposed&#xD;
to talk, the gray hunter followed him silently,&#xD;
thinking of Carl6ta, of Sebastian, Nick, and&#xD;
many other things connected with his recent&#xD;
experiences.&#xD;
It was near morning, and the young Indian&#xD;
made what haste he could, urging his horse to&#xD;
a gallop when the way permitted. In many&#xD;
places the path was dlancrous, but the ani-&#xD;

bore them onward with sure and trusty feet.&#xD;

leaving the Trace, amid at this point the-hunter&#xD;
supposed that his guide would leave him ; but&#xD;
he kept on before, choosing with evident skill&#xD;
the most accessible ways, and directing his&#xD;
course, as he' could readily perceive, toward&#xD;
the spot where he had met Hendricks the pre-&#xD;
vious night. The sun was high in the hea-&#xD;
vens when they reached the scene of the con-&#xD;
test.-&#xD;
"Here, I suppose, we shall part," said Path-&#xD;
away..&#xD;
"No part; Joe go on," replied the boy,&#xD;
composedly.,.                 - -&#xD;
" But you'll be missed. What account will&#xD;
you give of your absence ? If Captain Hen-&#xD;
dricks should know of your agency in this&#xD;
matter, I fear you would not come off with&#xD;
whole skin."&#xD;
"Joe no 'fraid Cap'n. Go with you to white&#xD;
man's camp-Nick, you call him."&#xD;
Joe glanced at Pathaway, then looked fixed-&#xD;
ly at 'his horse's head.'&#xD;
"6Did your mistress-did Carl6ta bid you&#xD;
attend me so far ?"asked the hunter.&#xD;
" Tole mnc stay longr's I pleased. Peirhaps&#xD;
Joe no go back ; perhaps he go here. there,&#xD;
everywhere-no know where he go. Be war-&#xD;
rior sometime."&#xD;
"Then you are at liberty to do as you&#xD;
wish V" answered the hunter, who had been so&#xD;
rncuh preoccupied during the ride that he&#xD;
had bestowed little notice upon Joe ; but now&#xD;
thought it worth while to observe him more&#xD;
closely. He was a well-clad, *ell-formed lad,&#xD;
who looked capable of making his way in the&#xD;
world as efficiently as any of his race. His&#xD;
long black hair hung straight and curlless&#xD;
upon his face and neck. He was quite dark,&#xD;
even for an Indian, andold enough to delight&#xD;
in paint and plumes. He had, clearly, been a&#xD;
favorite at the Valley, else he would not have&#xD;
been tricked out so bravely.&#xD;
-spoke only for your good. I care not to&#xD;
urge you toreturn to those lawless men ; but&#xD;
you are too young to go on the war-path, and&#xD;
&#xD;
your, tribe may be distant," added Pathaway,&#xD;
presently.&#xD;
" Can hunt, fish, take care hisself, Joe can.&#xD;
No need mind 'bout Joe."&#xD;
"How loing since you left your people ?"&#xD;
asked Patbaway.&#xD;
"Two, three,'four moons ago. White squaw&#xD;
give me clothes. Plenty to eat ; no work ;&#xD;
Joe no like work. Let squaw do work."&#xD;
The young Indian touched his horse with&#xD;
his hand and quickened his movements, so&#xD;
that the hunter was obliged  put his own&#xD;
into. a gallop to keep pace with him. In a&#xD;
short time they rode up to Nick. Whifiles'&#xD;
hut. Nick stood in the door, rifle in hand.&#xD;
His pleasure and astonishment were- about&#xD;
equal.&#xD;
eI'd about give ye up, by gracious !" he&#xD;
exclaimed.  "Took a tramp arter ye last&#xD;
night and was jest -startin' ag'in. Reckoned&#xD;
you'd turn up ; told Sebastian so, but he&#xD;
wouldn't hear to it, as 'twere, and nothmin'&#xD;
would pacify him. Consarned funny boy, he&#xD;
is !  And not funny, neither, but peculiar&#xD;
constituted.  He' didn't sleep a wink last&#xD;
night; but jest set by the fire and moped,&#xD;
goin' to the door every five minutes to look&#xD;
and listen. - Been on the war-path, I allow ?&#xD;
Come back with two hosses and a prisoner.&#xD;
Well, you're welcome,-ariyway. What's been&#xD;
the difikilty?"&#xD;
Sebastian came out while Nick was making&#xD;
these observations ; his first impulse, obvi-&#xD;
ously, was to run and seize Pathaway's hand,&#xD;
but he checked it, and stopped in an attitude&#xD;
indicative of surprise and joy.&#xD;
The hunter hastened to greet him.&#xD;
"What kind o' baggage you got here ?"&#xD;
asked Nick, eyeing the Indian sharply.&#xD;
Joe had not dismounted; he was looking&#xD;
earnestly at Sebastian.&#xD;
"This dark-skinned youth has been my&#xD;
guide from Trapper Valley," replied Patha-&#xD;
way.&#xD;
Trapper Valley !" exclaimed Seba'stian,&#xD;
clasping his hands, recoiling, and fixing his&#xD;
attention upon the guide.&#xD;
The hunter observed the start and sudden&#xD;
change of attitude.&#xD;
" So you have been in the Valley and got&#xD;
back alive ?" said Nick ; " and that's 'stomish-&#xD;
ii'. Ingin boy"-to Joe-" hop down anid let-&#xD;
me see what you look like."&#xD;
The boy did not honor this mandate with&#xD;
the least attention; but immediately,, in obe-&#xD;
dience to a sign from Iatlhaway, sprang light-&#xD;
ly to the ground.&#xD;
"A right nice-'pearin' boy ; though I must&#xD;
say, there's a slight tetch of dandyism about&#xD;
him, and uses more paint nor is'needful on&#xD;
common occasions. Trot round a little, young-&#xD;
ster, and let me see your paces," added Nick,&#xD;
eyeing the boy in his own whimsical manner,&#xD;
who, during this address, was staring at Se-&#xD;
bastian. In fact, a duel of eyes was persist-&#xD;

Patliway, smiling ; " but now, as I recall her&#xD;

To speak more intelligibly, she has a certain&#xD;

dashing ; and there are those easily dazzled&#xD;
by such qualities." Then to Joe : " What&#xD;
think you, boy? Is your mistress hand-&#xD;
some ?"&#xD;
The glittering eyes suddenly sought the&#xD;
ground, rested there a short time, then re-&#xD;
turned, inquiringly, to Pathaway.&#xD;
"To them that like her, she -handsome ; to&#xD;
them that no like her, no handsome."&#xD;
Joe shot another eye-bolt at Sebastian.&#xD;
"What do you care whether she's handsome&#xD;

eyes.       '&#xD;

Stbastian smiled, and Indian Joe changed&#xD;
his position uneasily.&#xD;
" The girl is wanting neither in sense nor&#xD;
beauty," remarked Pathaway ; "and I am not&#xD;
the man to believe that I make a conquest in&#xD;
every quarter where I may receive a favor.&#xD;
She is surely a wonderful creature, both in&#xD;
conversation and spirit ; and her language is&#xD;

-"Believe -me, my friend, it was because I&#xD;

Thevoice of Andrew Jeanjean came plaint-&#xD;

"Our camp-fire ihust rise somewhere else&#xD;

CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
INDIAN JOE AT CAMP.&#xD;
A curious part assembled at the morning&#xD;
.neal. Individua ly, they were singularly un.&#xD;
like, yet each manifested a noticeable interest&#xD;
in the other, Nick was uneasy, though con-&#xD;
tinually striving to appear cheerful, endeav-&#xD;
oring to inspirit the rest by his humorous sal-&#xD;
lies and unique stories. -Pathaway was seri-&#xD;
ous, Portneuf sad, Sebastian timid and 'at.&#xD;
times agitated, Indian Joe inquisitive with his&#xD;
eyes, taciturn with his lips, while the face of&#xD;
Andrew Jeanjean wore its usual mild and un-&#xD;
meaning expression. Each was watchful of&#xD;
the other without wishing to have the fact&#xD;
perceived. Sebastian unquestionably, shrank&#xD;
from the presence of Joe- is frequent flushes&#xD;
and evident perturbation being a source of an-&#xD;
noyance and anxiety to Nick.&#xD;
" It's them mean chills ag'in," he said in an&#xD;
aside voice to Pathaway, but which was au-&#xD;
dible to all present ; "and not the chills, nei-&#xD;
ther, but the hot stage of the disorder."&#xD;
The gray hunter hinted that he had not be-&#xD;
fore referred to this particular intermittent as&#xD;
affecting the lad, but had alluded to whoop-&#xD;
ing-cough and measles as the active agents of&#xD;
his infirmities.&#xD;
"You misunderstood me, colonel !"-Nick&#xD;
often addressed Pathaway by this title-" you&#xD;
sartinly did."&#xD;
He shook his head gravely, as if he knew&#xD;
he was doomed to be misinterpreted gener-&#xD;
ally.&#xD;
" I think I know as well's another what ails&#xD;
hir. It's ager-ager in its most voilent and&#xD;
chromatic form. 'Tisn't the kind they have&#xD;
in the clearin's, but ager run wild in the Nor'-&#xD;
west. I seed a whole tribe of Ingins shook to&#xD;
bits with it some twenty odd year ago. Fust&#xD;
they shook off an arm or a leg, then the arms&#xD;
and legs kept right on shakin' on their own&#xD;
responsibility, as 'twere.  It was a stirrin'&#xD;
spettakle, I tell ye! I passed over the ground&#xD;
the next day, and you couldn't -find a piece&#xD;
bigger'n your finger, nor two that could be&#xD;
put together ag'in as they 'riginally b'longed.&#xD;
It looked as if it had rained Ingins there for&#xD;
more'n a week. But the little chunks wasn't&#xD;
quiet by, no means ; each individooal one,&#xD;
quiverin' as though life depended on't. I'm&#xD;
'ware that this don't 'pear natril, and I don't&#xD;
insist on your b'lievin' it verbattim et scatter-&#xD;
atim, which, by the way, is, all the Latin I&#xD;
haven't forgot, though Doctor Whiffles can&#xD;
reel it off to ye by the yard. Ah, sich a man&#xD;
as the doctor was for a speech ! Speeches&#xD;
a'n't of much 'count up here, but at Selkirk&#xD;
and other clearin's they carry all afore 'em.&#xD;
He was captain of a fire company, my brother&#xD;
was-that was afore ho received his degree ;&#xD;
and 'tiyasn't afore, neither ; for com#o think&#xD;
on't, I b'lieve he never got;a diplomy, though&#xD;
he'd oughter, by mighty?,On.the 'casion I&#xD;
refer to, he presented tin trumpet to the&#xD;
&#xD;
former captain. He come on with his speech&#xD;
all writ, and full o' confidence, though his&#xD;
j'ints shook like prison. I wasn't there, but&#xD;
e talked beautiful, barrio' losm' his place a&#xD;
few times,.which ruther took him off his pins,&#xD;
as 'twere.  He wasn't a critter to be put&#xD;
down, not'stannin' his - condemned mem'ry,&#xD;
which would on'y hold a sartin number of&#xD;
syllables at a time. He talked of danger,'&#xD;
flames, and water, then of water, flames, and&#xD;
danger, which give it a inteestin' variety.&#xD;
Then the way he handled burnin' houses was&#xD;
prodigious, rushin' through walls o' solid&#xD;
blaze, scattering' firebrands right and left, res-&#xD;
zum' sleeping' families, and tossin' babies from&#xD;
the garret wonders to be ketched by the mul-&#xD;
titude below. What a effort that would a&#xD;
been if his thumb hadn't slipped at some o'&#xD;
the most startlin' p'ints ! Oh Lord, yes1"&#xD;
".No doubt," said Pathaway, absently, for&#xD;
during Nick's episode he had been studying&#xD;
the features of Andrew Jeanjean. " What do&#xD;
you think we had better do ?" he added, ab-&#xD;
rua tly.          ..        -   .    .&#xD;
Ii1eholas glanced significantly at the Indian&#xD;
boy.&#xD;
" I don't think that it's a good plan to dis-&#xD;
cuss matters of this kind afore strangers."&#xD;
" I'll answer for his fidelity !" replied Path-&#xD;
away.&#xD;
"That's more'n .I'll do !" returned Nick,&#xD;
dryly.&#xD;
" An Indian s an Indian !" exclaimed Sebas-&#xD;
tian, pointing.&#xD;
Nick looked up and saw Multnomah, the&#xD;
Shoshone, standing at the door.&#xD;
" Come in, Ingin-come in! There's allers&#xD;
room at my table for one pnore, though I&#xD;
ha'n't o fairly to housekeeping . Flop down&#xD;
and take your chance with us. Sonny"-to'&#xD;
Sebastian-" can't you saw off another slice,&#xD;
and don't be so keerful about s'iln' your fin-&#xD;
gers."&#xD;
"No stay-no eat," answered the Shoshone,&#xD;
gravely. "Multnomah would speak to Dou.&#xD;
bledark."&#xD;
"He hears ye, Ingin; speak on. Any signs&#xD;
of a diffikilty, eh ?"&#xD;
"The Shoshone has hunted and trapped with&#xD;
Doubledark, He is his friend and brother."&#xD;
" True, true ! And barring' the color your&#xD;
skin, which isn't 'cordin' to natur-my natur,&#xD;
leastwise-you're as honest a human-Ingins&#xD;
in course is human-as can be diskivered&#xD;
atween here andthe  Big Red. I know you've&#xD;
got a weakness for skulps, but the best on us&#xD;
has failin's."&#xD;
Nicholas regarded the Shoshone with friend-&#xD;
ly eyes--eyes that expressed far more than&#xD;
what he was saying.   ento Pathaway :&#xD;
. T, ere's them that would not trust that In-&#xD;
gi    use he isn't what he isn't, which is a&#xD;
white man : but, Lord bless ye, that skin o'&#xD;
hlis'n isn't thicker nor a sheet o' a r ; and&#xD;
arter-you git inside on't you can't tellthe dif-&#xD;
&#xD;
ferenee. Take that In''n and skin him, and&#xD;
I'll defy anybody to tell what race he b'longs&#xD;
to."&#xD;
"It is not the skin'that makes Ingindalugin&#xD;
inside. Nick love one thing, Multnomah an-&#xD;
other. The prairie wolf is not like the buffalo,&#xD;
nor the panther like the'antelope," said the&#xD;
Shoshon.&#xD;
"It may be so ; we won't dispute about it;&#xD;
but the inside of one watch is a good 'cal like&#xD;
the inside of another, though some'll run faster&#xD;
nor others: There's clocks, too, but the watch&#xD;
principle is in clocks, I allow."&#xD;
" Brother, I did not come to talk of- the&#xD;
way in which the Great Spirit has made us.&#xD;
Have you seen no clouds in the sky ? Will.it&#xD;
be fair to-morrow ?"&#xD;
Nick and the Shoshons looked at each&#xD;
other.&#xD;
"Ingin, the heavens are not clear ; there&#xD;
are dark places up aloft ; there are signs in&#xD;
the east," said the former.&#xD;
,i" I am glad that Doubledark is not blind.&#xD;
If he sees, why is he here ? Why does he&#xD;
not   to a covert like the birds of the air?"&#xD;
"Te birds leave no trail," muttered Nick,&#xD;
musingly.&#xD;
" The birds are wise. Not to man alone ,is&#xD;
wisdom given. Even the snake knows when&#xD;
his enemy is near, and creeps into its hole."&#xD;
While the Shoshone stood grave and digni.&#xD;
fled, his eyes' might occasionally be detected&#xD;
resting upon Sebastian and Indian;Joe; but&#xD;
his stoical face told no tales of his thought -&#xD;
"Shoshons," said Pathaway, addressing the.&#xD;
Indian, "speak plainly and not in the: lan-&#xD;
gua gof figures."&#xD;
" speak according to my nature," answer-&#xD;
ed Multnomah, proudly, and with a slight&#xD;
frown. - " The Master of Life never speaks to&#xD;
his children but in signs. . He does not -say&#xD;
'There will be a storm;' but He makesthe&#xD;
air heavy and puts a cloud in the sky.M Re;&#xD;
does not say : ' It will be fair to-morrow,' but&#xD;
makes the sun set red, as if it-went down i a&#xD;
battle-field."&#xD;
"Where will the sky be clear ?" atked&#xD;
Nick.&#xD;
" It will not be clear, but Multnomah would&#xD;
o to the North. I have noticed that some&#xD;
birds build their nests high among the rocks&#xD;
in the clefts and crevices."&#xD;
"Birds are not fools," quoth Nick.&#xD;
"We learn from the meanest things," re-&#xD;
sponded the chief.&#xD;
" But man, being gifted With speech," said&#xD;
Pathaway, " should use it intelligibly."&#xD;
" My talk is to those that can understand&#xD;
me.   Those that do not take my mean&#xD;
when I speak as Nature has taught me, would&#xD;
not be profited if I spoke in thq language of&#xD;
the pale faces." Then to Nick: "D6uble:&#xD;

" I can, and.I thank you,Iin,foryou&#xD;

that never gits tired, and never wears out."&#xD;
Indian Joe and Sebastian glanced at each&#xD;
other ; then the eyes of the latter sought the&#xD;
earth, finally wandering back to Nick.&#xD;
4 We'll go to Black Rock, Nicholas," he.&#xD;
said. "I should like to see the spot where you&#xD;
performed so brave an action."&#xD;
Indian Joe walked from the hut, Nick watch-&#xD;
ing him as he went out.&#xD;
" Keep sight o' that' eritter, colonel. I&#xD;
don't like the looks of him too well. I think&#xD;
'twould be a good plan to put him under some&#xD;
restraint, sich as tyin' his legs and lashin' him&#xD;
to a saplin'. Fust thing we know, he'll be off.&#xD;
Likely as any way, he's come 'mong us a sort&#xD;
o' spy ; if I thought he had, I'd go out and&#xD;
choke him, by mighty ! I seed the Shoshons&#xD;
lookin' at hin right smart, and l's glad he's&#xD;
bright enough not speak out no plainer."&#xD;
"I am confident that lie may be trusted ;&#xD;
though, placed as we are, we should observe&#xD;
every reasonable caution," said Pathaway.&#xD;
"I'll go out and cross-examine him, as&#xD;
'twere ; for I thought the conversation inter-&#xD;
ested him rayther too much, seen' he's clear&#xD;
Ingin, and we haven't nothin' in common."&#xD;
Nick arose and followed Joe, who had pro-&#xD;
ceeded toward the spot where the horses were&#xD;
grazing. The trapper approached the tawny&#xD;
boy with the soft, elastic step of an Indian.&#xD;
He touched him upon the shoulder. Joe&#xD;
turned, with a notable start of surprise.&#xD;
"You' a'n't a parfect redskin," said the&#xD;
trapper, quietly. " That's a kind of insex&#xD;
that's seldom taken onawares. An Ingin, in&#xD;
the reg'lar business of trail and war-path,&#xD;
wouldn't 'lowed me to steal a march on him."&#xD;
Joe put out his hands, and stepped back&#xD;
several paces, while the paint seemed to whiten&#xD;
on his face.&#xD;
"Joe young ; Joe never followed war-path.&#xD;
White man great hunter, very cunning !"&#xD;
The voice of the young savage was not clear,&#xD;
but husky with a predominant feeling.&#xD;
" Can't say the same of you, by gracious&#xD;
What you been looking' at them animiles for?"&#xD;
"Joe tired of stayiif in lodge. No know&#xD;
what pale-faces say; their talk is strange to&#xD;
Ingin  Joe." :-&#xD;
" Now you're lyin', you little scamp !" ex-&#xD;
claimed Nick, seizing the lad by the collar, and&#xD;
holding him with the grasp of a vice. "I&#xD;
obsarved ye, you young sarpent ! You heerd&#xD;
and understood as well as I or the little 'un ;&#xD;
and you not on'y understood, but you showed&#xD;
too much interest by considerable." . .&#xD;
At this point, Nick lifted Joe sup -and set&#xD;
him down again several times, as if to show&#xD;
him his strength.&#xD;
"I've killed a good many Ingin boys fust&#xD;
an' last, off and on," quoth the trapper, care-&#xD;
lessly; "and I don't sleep none the.worse'&#xD;
for't."&#xD;
Joe trembled at first, but gaining courage,&#xD;
spoke for himself:&#xD;

" What you go to hurt Joe ? Joe boy--you&#xD;
man ; if Joe man and you boy, Joe no choke,&#xD;
no shake !"&#xD;
"Ingin, you know too much. I'm less dis-&#xD;
posed to. trust ye than I-was afore. You may&#xD;
be all right, but I'm blest if I believe it!&#xD;
Where there's any doubt, it's best to treat an&#xD;
honest man as if he's a rogue. Arter this,&#xD;
you'll consider yourself a prisoner o' war; and&#xD;
not o' war neither, but of sareumstances."&#xD;
At this announcement, Joe became highly-&#xD;
indignant, his anger showing itself in his&#xD;
flushed face and sparkling eyes. At one mo-&#xD;
ment, Nick believed his passion would find&#xD;
vent in a flood of tears, but a sharp, though&#xD;
evident struggle checked the impulse. lie&#xD;
stood with his chest heaving like a sullen and&#xD;
petulant woman.&#xD;
"What !" he exclaimed ; then checked him-&#xD;
self, as if he had manifested too much feeling,&#xD;
or said something that he ought not to.&#xD;
"Did you say ' What?' " demanded Nick,&#xD;
stroking his beard with his disengaged hand.&#xD;
"Have you learned so soon to talk like white&#xD;
folks? A mighty sha-p and obsarvin' lad you&#xD;
be, I allow."&#xD;
"Joe say, What for you 'buse Ingin boy?&#xD;
He friend of pale face; guide him long way ;&#xD;
bring him here safe ; no let bad white man&#xD;
hurt him."&#xD;
"Jes' so !" answered Nick, mildly. "Sartin&#xD;
-zactly.   You took him from   the -mean&#xD;
skunks, and I'm 'bleeged to ye; but men in&#xD;
danger don't 'stan' on nice distinctions. You&#xD;
know what distinctions is, don't ye, redskin-?"&#xD;
Joe shook his head very slowly.&#xD;
" In course not ! A heathen bught n't to&#xD;
know' flambergasted. words. I'm glad you&#xD;
don't ; for I don't like to see insex of your&#xD;
color imitatin' their betters : so, beggin' your&#xD;
pardon, I'll jest trot ye back to camp."&#xD;
With a remorseless grip upon his arm that&#xD;
was nearly too much for Joe's stoicism, the&#xD;
trapper led, or 'rather dragged, him toward&#xD;
the hut.&#xD;
" I won't hurt ye-not a bit-Oh Lord, no !"&#xD;
-the boy was ready to cry with pain-" nor&#xD;
I won't injure your feelin's, or deprive ye of&#xD;
none o' your nat'ral rights ; but jest tie your&#xD;
legs, and hitch ye up to a little tree till you're&#xD;
wanted ; not 'cause I've got anythin' agin ye,&#xD;
for I ha'n't ; but to keep ye frorn runni&#xD;
away."&#xD;
" Joe no run ; no go to the Valley ; no tell."&#xD;
"I know ye wont, Ingin. It isn't in the&#xD;
natur' o' things for ye to git away arter I've&#xD;
tied ye up.".&#xD;
Nick looked at his captive, and saw two&#xD;
large tears trembling upon his long lashes.&#xD;
" I'm glad none o' your kith and kin is here,&#xD;
to see that !" added Nick. "'Mong your peo-&#xD;
ple, cryin' is left princip'ly to the squaws.&#xD;

camp. Pathaway 'came out to remonstrate&#xD;
with him about his treatment of the boy.&#xD;
"He is a mere child," he said, "and to me&#xD;
has thus far been faithful. I must protest&#xD;
against undue severity."&#xD;
"Sartin; it's your priverlege to pertest.&#xD;
But when life-is at stake, we musn't stan' at&#xD;
bearing' down a trifle on human natur' ; pro-&#xD;
vidin', allers, that Ingin natur' is of that sort.&#xD;
The missioners think 'tis; but, arter all that's&#xD;
said and done, they're heathen-not knowin' a&#xD;

we must git ready for a start. Portneuf, whip&#xD;

viceable. We shall be hunted like hares,;&#xD;
but I trust we shall he able to put cunnin'&#xD;
agi cunnin', and throw the hounds from the&#xD;

Joe unresistingly suffered his hands to be&#xD;
bound, though he cast, occasionally, reproach-&#xD;
ful glances at Pathaway. Repeating his ad-&#xD;
monition to the Frenchman to keep a strict&#xD;
watch over Joe, Nick thoughtfully left camp&#xD;
to test the power of his educated faculties and&#xD;
sharpened instincts.&#xD;
As soon as lie was out of sight, the gray&#xD;
hunter app-oached the youthful Indian, and&#xD;
said, soothingly:..&#xD;
"Do not be grieved, my lad, at this treat-&#xD;
ment. You shall come to no harm. Submit&#xD;
patiently to the humors of Nick Whiffles, who,&#xD;
I am suire; will not wrong you intentionally.'&#xD;
He then examined the cord about his wrists,&#xD;
and, finding it rather tight, loosened it.&#xD;
Joe said nothing -neither expressed his&#xD;
thanks nor his resentment-4:hut stood with&#xD;
lowniast eyes and moody' brow.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXII.s&#xD;
NICK GETS INFORMATION ABOUT HIMSELF.&#xD;
All remained quiet at the little camp in theft&#xD;
wilderness. The day passed without bringing&#xD;
fresh adventure or new signs of the nearness of I&#xD;
enemies. The only observable difference of&#xD;
departure from the common routine was, that&#xD;
the fire was extinguished after the morning&#xD;
meal; nor was it lighted again till nearly night,S&#xD;
and then kept burning but long enough to pre-&#xD;
pare their simple articles of food. Both Nickc&#xD;
and Pathaway were outlying the camp during s&#xD;
the greater part of the dlay, to note those cvi- 3&#xD;
denies of foes perceptible to experienced eyes f&#xD;
alone, and utterly invisible to the novice, how-&#xD;
ever developed his natural perspicacity. Many v&#xD;
times-did Doubledark ascend the hills and ri-&#xD;
ing grounds in the vicinity, and cast searching&#xD;
glances toward the Valley, the eastern slopes, b&#xD;
and the whole surrounding tract, far as his r&#xD;
As soon as athe unhad veiled his glories s&#xD;
&#xD;
behind the mountains, Nick led the horses to&#xD;
the door, and covered their feet with large&#xD;
strips of buffalo and deer-skin-observing ex-&#xD;
traordinary care in the performance.&#xD;
"Man," he  said, "that hasn't been gifted&#xD;
with the instine's of the lower aniniiles, has&#xD;
reason to make up for't. You perceive, little&#xD;
un"--addressing Sebastian more Particularly&#xD;
-" that,I put on these bandages with the hair&#xD;
side out, which makes a soft cushion for the&#xD;
feet, and leaves no track for a pryin' Black-&#xD;
foot, or, what amounts to the same thing, the&#xD;
runagade whiteskins that have fell from the&#xD;
grace of their color, as' 'twre, and rendered&#xD;
theirselves fit marks for the fust honest rifle&#xD;
that can be brought to bear on 'em. Bad&#xD;
stuff," he muttered, musingly, "is white blood&#xD;
turned sour."&#xD;
Hie paused in his labors ; and holding a fore-&#xD;
foot of his horse Shagbark upon his knee, with&#xD;
the akin gathered upon it in folds, held by his&#xD;
left hand, raised his right with suggestive&#xD;
earnestness, as if lie would appeal to every ra-&#xD;
tional person's understanding, and added :&#xD;
"If the p'ison newspapers had got hold of&#xD;
them mean skunks, instead of a simple old&#xD;
trapper who giner'ly minds his own business,&#xD;
and don't keer to have his business advertised,&#xD;
they'd a hit it!"&#xD;
- Nicholas breathed better after this remark,&#xD;
and, with a face upon which there was dissat-&#xD;
isfaction, but no anger, tied a buckskin thong&#xD;
over the segment of buffalo skin that shielded&#xD;
the sharp hoof of his animal.&#xD;
" They have carried you ever and ever so&#xD;
many miles, uncle .Nick, those feet," said Se-&#xD;
bastian.&#xD;
"Younmav b'lieve it, Humbug," replied&#xD;
Nik  deliberation.&#xD;
" Yes, white boy humbug !" exclaimed In-&#xD;
dian Joe, scornfully.-&#xD;
"Hullo!0 look out what you say there, red-&#xD;
skin, or you '11 be put mnder a trifle of restraint&#xD;
ag'in "&#xD;
At the solicitation of Pathaway, the boy-&#xD;
guide had been released from the ignominy of&#xD;
bonds-he having expressed so much faith in&#xD;
is integrity, that Donbledark had reluctantly&#xD;
yielded to his wishes.&#xD;
Thm horses having been duly moccasined,&#xD;
Sebastian was placed upon one of them, which&#xD;
was, of course, Nick's.&#xD;
"We must let the little un ride, on 'count&#xD;
of his arm, which is cut nighabout off; and I&#xD;
shouldn't wonder if mortification sets in soon.&#xD;
Mortification runs in the blood of the Whif&#xD;
heses."&#xD;
"Y ou told me,'" said Pathaway, quickly,&#xD;
with a troubled look, ."that the lad's flesh&#xD;
heals with remarkable readiness."&#xD;
"When at rest, it does; but jest let that&#xD;
boy stir about more 'a common on them spat'-&#xD;

Long rifle ; kill Ingin every shot. That no&#xD;

'the brow of the Blackfoot grew darker with&#xD;
resentment. A few twinkling stars threw a&#xD;
feeble iight upon his dusky face. He resem-&#xD;
bled a dark picture in a dark setting, with&#xD;
Bill Brace and-the cabin for a background.&#xD;
" Can't say, Blackfoot, that, I'm sorry a&#xD;
prisoner got away, though it seems like an in-&#xD;
jury to you. The critter was Jack Wiley, and&#xD;
belongs to Cap'n Dick's fellers.  If you'd&#xD;
made an'eend 'o Jack, our boys would a been&#xD;
arter ye, and there'd been no friendship atween&#xD;
us ; so his meddlin' that time turned out for&#xD;
the best."&#xD;
Nick lifted the breech of his rifle a little&#xD;
from the leaves, and his fingers worked upon&#xD;
the barrel as if playing on an instrument, but&#xD;
a feeling, either of policy or humanity, pre-&#xD;
vented his sending the unerring bullet. He'&#xD;
scanned his lurking and persevering enemy&#xD;
with an interest awakened by the revelations&#xD;
he had heard. Had he indeed been singled&#xD;
out by the tawny nomads of the wilderness&#xD;
as a special victim of their vengeance ? Was&#xD;
this circumstance new to him? It was not.&#xD;
A wandering life, stretching over some twen-&#xD;
ty-five years, had taught him the peculiarities&#xD;
of savage nature ; given him an insight into&#xD;
its wiles, artifices, and obstinate persistence in&#xD;
dogging the footsteps of an enemy. He had&#xD;
been instructed unon the dangerous trapping-&#xD;
grounds by - sudden surprises ; by forced&#xD;
marches and hasty flights ; by chance rencon-&#xD;
tres in a hundred places, by countless contin-&#xD;
gencies incident to that kind of existence, un-&#xD;
til his sensibilities had grown sharp and his&#xD;
knowledge approximated to the keenness of in-&#xD;
stinct. Even his present position proved how&#xD;
much training had done for him ; he stood&#xD;
within a few yards of inveterate enemies--two,&#xD;
certainly, with more, doubtless, within call-.-&#xD;
one man, yet firm and confident, and conscious&#xD;
of his own abilities to meet emergencies. .&#xD;
"Seven Plumes shall have Doubledark to&#xD;
carry to his village," said Brace, with deter-&#xD;
niiination. " His skulp shall hang up in his&#xD;
lodge after his women and children have played&#xD;
with. it, and paraded it about on a pole. A&#xD;
pooty thing it'll be, to p'int to it and say,&#xD;
'That's the akulp of Nick Whiffes !"'&#xD;
The trapper imagined that he could see a&#xD;
sinister scowl upon the Indian's forehead,&#xD;
which grew more malign as Brace went on.&#xD;
"The great Nor'west," resumed the latter,&#xD;
&#xD;
bitterly, "has rung long enough with the&#xD;
name of Doubledark. You can't go nowhere&#xD;
but you'll hear on him. Go up the Big Red,&#xD;
and they'll ask for fifty mile along its banks&#xD;
if you've seed him. Go down the' Columby,&#xD;
and it's the same thing over ag'in. Take a&#xD;
long tramp 'cross the lakes to Montreal, and&#xD;
the Frenchmen 'ill ask, ' Are ye 'quainted with&#xD;
Nick Whiffles ?' On the southern slope of the&#xD;
Rocky mountains they'll want to know what&#xD;
Nick'Whiffles is doin', and if he's coming' down&#xD;
that way soon. ' I know this is so, both by my&#xD;
own experience and what I've heerd from&#xD;
others."&#xD;
" He great warrior, great hunter, great&#xD;
trapper, great everything !" asserted Seven&#xD;
Plumes, reflectively.&#xD;
" Great as he is, he's yourn. Cap'n Hen-&#xD;
dricks says you shall have him, if he's got&#xD;
men enough to take him, though he don't&#xD;
wan't to be known much in the business him-&#xD;
self, for everytilin' that's done here works&#xD;
down into the clearin's in course o' time. He's&#xD;
got heaps of knives, blankets, and beads for&#xD;
his brothers the Blackfeet. 'Chief, bring out&#xD;
your braves ; let 'em swarm into every pass&#xD;
and valley, perarie, and bit 'o timber in this&#xD;
stretch o' country. There's a boy and a man&#xD;
with him ; the man," he added, depressing his&#xD;
voice. " b'longs to me."&#xD;
" Me know !" said Seven Plumes, quickly..&#xD;
"You fought together like squaws. He knock&#xD;
Bill Brace down-strike dam  hard ! Make&#xD;
face look like squaw's face when she been beat&#xD;
by drunken Ingin. Wah ! wah !"&#xD;
Seven Plumes-turned up his nose in con-&#xD;
tempt.&#xD;
Bill Brace swore an oath which would not&#xD;
grace our pages, exhibiting his chagrin in an&#xD;
unmistakable manner.&#xD;
" The boy," he continued, wincing, " must&#xD;
be taken, too. Cap'n Dick wants him, but&#xD;
what for, is more'n I know ; he talks about&#xD;
him queer, 'pearin' to be afeard on him one&#xD;
minute, and inquisitive 'bout him the next.&#xD;
Does Seven-Plumes understand ?"&#xD;
" Ugh, ugh !"&#xD;
"Then," proceeded Brace, "there's a crit-&#xD;
ter, a Frenchman called Portneuf, that's got to&#xD;
be put one side 'fore he can snuff the air of the&#xD;
settlements. Don't stan' on ceremony with&#xD;
him, chief, but lift his hair quick's you can.&#xD;
He's been in the Valley, and in a ha ter, too,&#xD;
but by some kind of deviltry or niekromaney&#xD;
-which Nick Whiffles may be at the bottom&#xD;
of, for all I know-slipped out neck and heels,&#xD;
hose and all. He might talk, you know. Do&#xD;
you hear ?"&#xD;
"Am I a tree or a stone?"&#xD;
" You may be a clod afore you know it !"&#xD;
muttered Nick.&#xD;
" Then I have spoke to the p'int, and we'll&#xD;
set ourselves to work to pick outthis trail. It'll&#xD;
go hard with us, if Ingin cunnin' and white&#xD;
cunnin' can't outwit him."&#xD;

&#xD;
" It'll go hard with me and them with me,"&#xD;
was the conviction that forced itself upon the&#xD;
trapper,. if you do."&#xD;
The Indian and Brace now commenced a&#xD;
fresh examination of the spot ; while they were&#xD;
looking at every indentation in the earth,&#xD;
every wound of the'tender grass, every disturb-&#xD;
ance of the leaves, with their faces close to the&#xD;
earth, Nick silently retreated, following with&#xD;
cautious strides the party in which he felt so&#xD;
deep an interest, not so much by the trail,&#xD;
which was scarcely perceptible, even to him,&#xD;
but from perfect familiarity with the route&#xD;
Portneuf had taken.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
THE YOUNG INDIAN .MAKES A STARTLING&#xD;
ANNOUNCEMENT. &#xD;
Psthaway and the lads, conducted by the&#xD;
Frenchman, passed over considerable ground&#xD;
before Nick overtook them. In the interim,&#xD;
the hunter, agreeably to his promise, had kept&#xD;
near Sebastian, watching his movements with&#xD;
friendly zeal, ready to assist him in case ofneed.&#xD;
The youth received his attentions with a sin-&#xD;
gular mixture of gratitude and timidity-the&#xD;
latter, that inexplicable shrinking that often&#xD;
rendered his character feminine. The eyes of&#xD;
Indian Joe frequently wandered to the parties,&#xD;
but with no pleased expression. The gray&#xD;
hunter noticed at length his persistent, and at&#xD;
times, anxious glances, and walked to his side,&#xD;
leaving Sebastian in the rear.&#xD;
" Joe," he said, in a gentle manner, "I re-&#xD;
gret that one who has done me a ervice&#xD;
should be thus treated ; but we are placed in a&#xD;
position so perilous that we are forced to use&#xD;
every reasonable precaution ; although I con-&#xD;
fess that were it not for our friend, the trap-&#xD;
per, I would not consent to this measure, but&#xD;
allow your limbs to remain free."&#xD;
" Ingin boy no 'count. He guide pale-face,&#xD;
but no matter. White hunter no memory. Tie&#xD;
Joe up like dog-he no feel-he no care---his&#xD;
flesh no have pain I"&#xD;
The boy pronounced these abrupt sentences&#xD;
in an aggrieved tone, and Pathaway would not&#xD;
have been surprised to see tears flow down his&#xD;
red cheeks. But his grief-if grief it were-&#xD;
was mingled with a spirit that would occasion-&#xD;
ally flash up wild and fervent. Not knowing&#xD;
how to' soothe a nature like his, - Pathaway&#xD;
kept pace with the slow movements of his&#xD;
horse in silence, waiting for a different mood&#xD;
to come over him to render him more placa-&#xD;
ble.&#xD;
"Why you walk 'side Joe? Joe no white.&#xD;
Go walk 'longside squaw !" The young Indian&#xD;
threw a scornful look backward at Sebastian.&#xD;
" What did you say, Joe ?" asked the hunter,&#xD;
glancing inquiringly at his features.&#xD;
" Go walk with squaw--talk with squaw, and&#xD;
no mind Ingin Joe, who save your life !"&#xD;
. "You call him a squaw," answered Patha-&#xD;
way,.musing, "but the term of reproach is un-&#xD;
&#xD;
merited. I know he is very contradictory in&#xD;
his behavior, but I do believe that he is not&#xD;
wanting in courage, as that wound upon his&#xD;
arm attests."&#xD;
" How ?" asked Joe, eagerly, as if thrown off&#xD;
his guard.&#xD;
" He bravely interposed that member be-&#xD;
tween my own person and the knife of an as-&#xD;
sassin -a burly ruffian called Bill Brace,&#xD;
whom it was once my privilege to punish for&#xD;
his insolence."&#xD;
"Bill Brace 1" repeated Joe, with a slight&#xD;
start.&#xD;
" Yes, Bill Brace ; one of the creatures of&#xD;
the man Hendricks. I might have been sleep-&#xD;
ing soundly beneath the green turf of the wil-&#xD;
derness,'had it not been for Sebastian Delau-&#xD;
nay. Even the wandering red man knows how&#xD;
to-repay gratitude, and bears ever inhis breast,&#xD;
as a sacred deposit, the remembrance of a&#xD;
favor."&#xD;
" Has no one else saved the life of the pale.&#xD;
face. hunter?" Joe demanded sharply, almost&#xD;
angrily.&#xD;
"Yes, Carlta--the strange girl qarldta !"&#xD;
responded Pathaway, sighing. " She might&#xD;
have been lovely in character as in person ;&#xD;
but now, alas ! she is Beauty run wild ." Then&#xD;
he added, " And wicked, too."&#xD;
"She saved life, but you no like her. That&#xD;
not the way Ingin does ; he no forget when&#xD;
friend come, take him by the hand and say&#xD;
'you free ; here hoss with saddle, bridle, and&#xD;
here Ingin boy, that no betray you."&#xD;
"Do those cords hurt your'wrists ?" Patha-&#xD;
way asked, after an embarrassing silence.&#xD;
".They cut into he flesh, gbut Joe no com-&#xD;
plain. He git pay that way for what he done."&#xD;
"I'll hazard the risk of freeing your hands,&#xD;
at any rate," said Pathaway, touched with re-&#xD;
morse, and immediately out the boy's'bonds&#xD;
with his'knife. "I will trust you ; see thatmy&#xD;
confidence is not abused."&#xD;
" Joe no make promise ; he do what he&#xD;
please, but no make promise. He tell pale-&#xD;
face, though, that that boy no boy ; he squaw-&#xD;
he woman !"&#xD;
The blood flushed up to Pathaway's brow.&#xD;
" Joe tell truth ; he no he--that boy, wo-&#xD;
man !"&#xD;
For some reason Pathaway did not immedi-&#xD;
ately answer. Perhaps he was comparing the&#xD;
young Indian's startling assertion with his-own&#xD;
thoughts, and. evidences gathered from a&#xD;
thousand trifling circumstances. He partially&#xD;
turned and threw an earnest look 'at Sebastian&#xD;
Delaunay ; the youth's face appeared more&#xD;
beautiful than ever. His large, dreamy eyes&#xD;
beamed with softer'light, while his wondrous&#xD;
symmetry of person shaped itself into a form&#xD;
of additional grace. The little hand, the di-&#xD;
minutive foot and daintily turned ankle, had&#xD;
new meaning for Pathaway.. He recalled the&#xD;
occasion of the dressing of the wounded arm,&#xD;
and the vague, and then almost improbable&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
suspicion that had floated dimly and distantly&#xD;
across the horizon of his mind,'vet with suf,&#xD;
ficient vividness to give him a strange thrill&#xD;
For a moment he forgot everything but the one&#xD;
absorbing conviction that Indian. Joe had&#xD;
forced upon him.&#xD;
"lIe's a tender p1ant-a delicate half-breed,&#xD;
I allow, but certainly. Joe, you have started&#xD;
an improbable conjecture," he said, presently.&#xD;
"Pale-face wise, bu t he no deceive 'oe. Ile&#xD;
-feel all the time, boy, woman; white man's&#xD;
heart tell him boy, woman ; but' he no want&#xD;
to believe what it'-say ; 'so .he go on like one&#xD;
in dream, now satisfied, now not ; now no:&#xD;
care, now care ihelr."&#xD;
Joe's penetrating eyes looked at Pathaway&#xD;
as if to read the obseurest page of his heart.&#xD;
In truth, the gray hunter was visibly agitated,.&#xD;
and Carl6ta'and °the banditti of'Trapper Val-&#xD;
ley were swept from his consciousness. Had "&#xD;
Joe indeed lfladea disclosure ?4, If the cpersen&#xD;
in question were indeed a woman, what was:&#xD;
her history,-and why was she wandering like&#xD;
a damsel errant in the Northern wilds?&#xD;
"Her eyes were like soft star-beams gleaming&#xD;
atitfitdg ht oh the' sleping matef;  ,.&#xD;
, Her face was ever on me beaming, -,.&#xD;
evel the wandering trapper's dp4ghter.&#xD;
Ohthe trapper's daughter!"&#xD;
The voice of Andrew Jeanjeana was, lifted,&#xD;
monrfully unpda the night ,air, and borne&#xD;
away over bush and; brake. and waving grass.&#xD;
At that instant Nlk overtook them.&#xD;
" That's rutllergood u;usic," he said, "but&#xD;
it hasn't power toQsoothe the savage breast&#xD;

never-tiring kindness,; his gentle',delicacy ;&#xD;
his immeasurable friendship. Here was a&#xD;
niystery ! And into this mystery, l'athaway&#xD;
passed with all his being., He no ;longer felt&#xD;
indifference respecting the .dangers that sur-&#xD;
rounded them.- Here was an object thrown&#xD;
upon,his care that gave an interest to flight&#xD;
and defeuce. - The romance, of woman was&#xD;
upon the wilderness. T he charm  of her in-&#xD;
nocenee, hopelessness, and beauty gave new&#xD;
incentive to effort, and converted the wide-i&#xD;
&#xD;
stretching North into an arena where lances&#xD;
might be broken and gallant deeds performed.&#xD;
Already he was conscious of that enchantment&#xD;
that ever waits upon the presence, and lives in&#xD;
the voice and smiles of that softer sex to&#xD;
which all men, sooner or later, yield homage.&#xD;
He felt his maiabod. revive, and began.to&#xD;
take an active interest in their, nocturnal&#xD;
flight.&#xD;
By: this:time they had reached a spot where&#xD;
the, cu-de--sac, or, blind alley, leading to the&#xD;
basin which had received the'name of Black&#xD;
Rock, on account of the towering masses of&#xD;
dark rock-that hemmed ri in. Nick Whiffles&#xD;
had reason to reniember the place ; he had.&#xD;
not only lost traps there in an unexplainable&#xD;
manner, but ha'd'witnessed, in' addition, 'that&#xD;
terrible drama described in the first chapter&#xD;
of our tale.&#xD;
S4thatf obterved that Sebastian shivered&#xD;
the moment his shadow fell within the narrow&#xD;
portal. Niek was at the lad's side in an in-&#xD;
stant,'speaking, ina low voice, words of en-&#xD;
couragement.&#xD;
. " Under ordinary edrcumstances, this spot&#xD;
would be safe," said Nick, presently, " but as'&#xD;
things is, we can't rely entirely on its security;&#xD;
for the red 'heathen are leagued with our ene-&#xD;
mies, and, we: may expect to hear from 'em&#xD;

"Not a -bit on't! not a bit on't! Should&#xD;
like tW hear somebody say that you're afeard,&#xD;
or that you're capable o' being' skeer d in any&#xD;
manner," answered Nick, heartily.&#xD;
A low, disdainful laugh came, from the di-&#xD;
reelion of indian Joe; .but. when the trapper&#xD;
looked at him sharply, he appeared as sullen&#xD;
nd absent as ever.   -     .&#xD;
"Ingin boys git big enough to skulp when&#xD;
they're about 'leven year'old !" observed Nick,&#xD;
contracting his brow till-there was a vertical&#xD;
wrinkle on the. line of, and parallel with his&#xD;
.nose.&#xD;
Whether Joe ; understood this, remark as&#xD;
having any application to himself, is problem-&#xD;
atical.  A. smile - lingered an. instant on the&#xD;
pale lips- of Sebastian, but wbich suddenly&#xD;
faded as they emerged from the winding alley&#xD;
into the basin -&#xD;

marred by the busy and wasting touch of Time.&#xD;
The dark stream upon which Nick had be-&#xD;
stowed the appellation of Black Run, lay be-&#xD;
fore them like a surface of ebony.&#xD;
Sebastian pressed closely to Nicholas; there&#xD;
was a perceptible wildness in his manner,&#xD;
while his face was strikingly pallid, consider-&#xD;
ing the mixture of his blood. The gray hun-&#xD;
ter purposely placed himself near the youth,&#xD;
and observing signs of his besetting weakness&#xD;
upon him, remarked to the trapper :&#xD;
"Our young friend has the chills again."&#xD;
" Not the chills, not the chills," said Nick,&#xD;
but the animosity of his wound. It gives him&#xD;
a deal o' pain, but being' of Ingin natur, in&#xD;
part, leastwise, he's too proud to complain.&#xD;
You've no idee how much torment he can&#xD;
stan'! I r'ally b'lieve that he could have a&#xD;
double tooth distracted Iby,a Selkirk doctor&#xD;
'thout wincin'; and that's sayi4' a good 'eal&#xD;
for his fortitude, for the teeth of the Whiffleses&#xD;
come mighty hard. They tried to pull one&#xD;
for me, the doctors did, but they ained their&#xD;
money, by 'gracious !  Arter they'd broke&#xD;
several instruments and made my mouth a&#xD;
gorge o' blood, I told 'em, 'Hold on,' sez I,&#xD;
and they's right glad to 'leave go.&#xD;
"'Bring a lariat,' sez I. The lariat was&#xD;
brung.&#xD;
"' Put a runnin' noose round the grinder,'&#xD;
sez I, and they did it.&#xD;
"'Make t'other eend fast to a tree,' sez I,&#xD;
and they 'beyed the order. When this was&#xD;
done, taking a pistol in each hand, I sez to&#xD;
'em : ' Seize me by the heels !' sez I, and b&#xD;
the heels they seized me. ' Now pull,' sez I,&#xD;
and the fust man as lets go afore the tooth's&#xD;
out, I'll shoot!' sez I. Then there was some&#xD;
pullin' and tuggin' for 'bout fifteen minutes or&#xD;
up'ards, and the parspiration rolled off 'em&#xD;
like rain from the ruff of,a house in a shower.&#xD;
It hurt like p'ison ! I thought to gracious&#xD;
every bone in my systum was coming' out; but&#xD;
I'd had the jump' toothache goin' on two&#xD;
months and was worked up to a desprit pitch.&#xD;
'What's the use,' thought I, 'of havin' bones&#xD;
if there's to be a consarned diffikilty in 'em&#xD;
all the time? Might's well have no bones, as&#xD;
to have rotten ones. Some animiles,' I reason-&#xD;
ed, ' don't have no bones. There's snakes, for&#xD;
instance, don't have none,to brag on, and they&#xD;
squirm about and git over the ground like&#xD;
lightning' and I'm equal to a snake, anyday.'&#xD;
And with that I menaced 'em with my wee-&#xD;
pons, and the grinder came out spiteful, with&#xD;
a noise as loud as the crack of a rifle."&#xD;
Nick paused, then added, shaking his head:&#xD;
"I'll never have no more pulled, for it&#xD;
shocked my -skileton terrible ; and took out&#xD;
a good bit o' the narvous systum ; for the&#xD;
grinders, you know, are set right into the&#xD;
narvous system."&#xD;
Pathaway was not backward to perceive the&#xD;
tact of the trapper in leading his mind from&#xD;
the youth, and to divert the thoughts of the&#xD;
&#xD;
"&#xD;
&#xD;
88&#xD;
&#xD;
latter to a subject more agreeable than that&#xD;
which manifestly disturbed him.&#xD;
"Does your wound indeed give you so much&#xD;
pain ?" Pathaway asked, in a voice modulated&#xD;
more softly than usual ; for since the strange&#xD;
declaration of Indian Joe, he had felt a strong&#xD;
desire to hear Sebastian converse. His tones,&#xD;
always clear and low, were now to him more&#xD;
melodious, and he listened to" them with rapt&#xD;
attention.&#xD;
" You distress yourself on my account too&#xD;
much," he said, with a strong attempt at&#xD;
cheerfulness.  "Uncle Nick, I believe, has&#xD;
spoiled me by too much petting. - If he had&#xD;
subjected me to more hardship, been less&#xD;
careful of my comfort, and more desirous of&#xD;
my reputation as a hunter, my person would&#xD;
have been seasoned to the hardships of the&#xD;
life to which I was born."  .,.&#xD;
"Nonsense !" interrupted Nick, " I know&#xD;
what you're capable of better nor you do.&#xD;
You can travel, and suffer, and starve with&#xD;
the best of us, on a pinch ; and not on a&#xD;
pinch, neither, but at the shortest notice."&#xD;
" Can he trap ?" Pathaway inquired, me-&#xD;
chanically.&#xD;
"'Twould do you good to see him trap!"&#xD;
answered Nick, with unction. He'll put that&#xD;
foot o' his'n on the spring of a trap in a way&#xD;
you don't think of. Click ! 'and down it goes,&#xD;
and his fingers work into the jaws of the trap,&#xD;
break 'em down, and fix the trencher surpns-&#xD;
in'! He knows jest where to place the thing,&#xD;
too, and how to conceal it in the grass.&#xD;
'Twould 'stonish ye to see the fur the lad's&#xD;
ketehed, fust and last.  He follers up the&#xD;
streams as if by instine' and not by larnmn'"&#xD;
"He's a good shot, doubtless ?" continued&#xD;
the hunter, interested in the honest zeal of the&#xD;
trapper.&#xD;
"He shoots beyend everythin'! Set up a&#xD;
mark of some bigness a little ways off for that&#xD;
boy to hit, and you'll see -p'ints o' character&#xD;
that you don't mistrust. He had a small rifle&#xD;
of his own--a nice one, that I paid a hundred&#xD;
dollars for if I paid a cent, but 'twas stole&#xD;
from him whew his hoss was stole. I told you&#xD;
that some thievish critter took his animile,&#xD;
didn't I ? I's sorry for the loss, 'cause it conic&#xD;
of a good breed, and in size was about of a&#xD;
niuchness with Sparrer-Legs."&#xD;
Sebastian, who had been walking unsteadi-&#xD;
ly, tottered, and would have fallen had it not&#xD;
been for the friendly interposition of Patha-&#xD;
way, who caught him' in his arms, and in the&#xD;
haste of doing so, grasped him by his wound-&#xD;
ed arm. The pain produced by' the action&#xD;
probably served to recover' him; deep flush&#xD;
came to his cheeks, but no exclamation of suf-&#xD;
fering passed his lips., While the gray hunter&#xD;
supported him, Nick ran to the stream and&#xD;
broughtwater in his cap, which grateful liquid&#xD;
he sprinkled upon his face.&#xD;
The hunter, holding the hand of the injured&#xD;
member in his, felt something warm upon his&#xD;

own, and perceived with alarm that it was&#xD;
stained with crimson drops. His sudden grasp&#xD;
had loosened the bandages and started the&#xD;
bleeding afresh. Nicholas detected the cir-&#xD;
cumstance at the same time, and appeared for&#xD;
a moment embarrassed. But it was for an in-&#xD;
stant, only, that he was nonplussed'; bringing&#xD;
from some mysterious pocket a yellow bandan-&#xD;
na of long service, by no means above suspicion&#xD;
in the matter of cleanliness, he bound it about&#xD;
Sebastian's arm outside the sleeve of his frock.&#xD;
Pathaway expressed dissatisfaction at this&#xD;
impromptu surgery, but was gravely assured&#xD;
that he had actednaccording to universal eus-&#xD;
tone in the Northwest. Sebastian was uncon-&#xD;
seious but a few seconds, and glanced timidly&#xD;
at Nick when he recovered, as if fearful of&#xD;
being censured for his weakness.&#xD;
"Forgive me, uncle Nick !" lie murmured.&#xD;
" Not a tallI" answered Nick.&#xD;
"You are angry !" said the lad, much&#xD;
troubled.  "I have gone beyond your pa-&#xD;
tience."&#xD;
"iThe Lord love ye, no!   It's that con-&#xD;
demned diflikilty that makes you so shaky in&#xD;
the j'ints."&#xD;
The trapper looked at the rocks and re-&#xD;
membered the torches that had once flashed&#xD;
across their rough sides and gleamed down on&#xD;
the 'water. His countenance grew serious.&#xD;
"4Necessity," lie said, addressing Sebastian,&#xD;
"brings us here ; but it's a .necessity that&#xD;
shan't last long if I can help it. I. under-&#xD;
stan' you obsarve, what natur is, and how&#xD;
some .folks feel under sartin earcumstances.&#xD;
This is but a temporary hidi'-place; a spot&#xD;
"where we stop to breathe, as 'twere, and where&#xD;
we'll leave the houses, prehaps. We're hunt-&#xD;
ed, and it's needful that d should watch the&#xD;
inemy. Seven-Plumes, the chief of the Black-&#xD;
feet, is a renowned warrior that has an on-&#xD;
pleasant hankering' for my hair ; and if there's&#xD;
a varmint cunning enough to lift it, lie's the&#xD;
one.,though I shall throw as many diffikilties&#xD;
in his way as possible ; for a man'll part with&#xD;
e'enamost snytihin' else more cheerfuller nor&#xD;
lhe will with his skulp. I can play at the&#xD;
game of low cunnin' as well as another ; but&#xD;
I'll he skinned if it's in me to take the top-&#xD;
knot of a dead inemy, though I've knowd&#xD;
white folks as would do it. Colonel, stay&#xD;
here and , look arter this boy ; and not too&#xD;
much, neither ; for you'll make him bleed&#xD;
an'in if you stare at him as you do sometimes.&#xD;
Here's the Ingin, too, who must be 'tended to,&#xD;
for mtofy confidence in him is, shook. The&#xD;
heathen chief is sharp at a trail, and may be&#xD;
closer than- is safe.  Come, Frenchman, o&#xD;
with me ; for I recollect that you used to be&#xD;
no fool in matters o' the woods and red-&#xD;
skins."&#xD;
"fBut why not take .me for your compan-&#xD;
ion -" said 1'athaway, somewhat piqued.&#xD;
41To be frank, because you are the stronger&#xD;
of the two, and rayther the quickest with&#xD;
&#xD;
your eyes and rifle, prehaps ; and you're in&#xD;
duty bound to stick to the boy that was will-&#xD;
in' to risk his own life for your'n."-&#xD;
Without waiting to hear further remon-&#xD;
strance, Nick glided away, followed by Port-&#xD;
neuf.&#xD;
The gloom of the night perceptibly light-&#xD;
ened, the clouds lifting and the moon appear-&#xD;
ing dimly, affording Pathaway a tolerable&#xD;
view of surrounding objects. The jagged out-&#xD;
lines of the rocks, separated from, and seemed&#xD;
to rise out of the darkness, defining their&#xD;
rude, strength with a boldness that was strik-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
"nBehold," said the hunter, sweeping the&#xD;
basin with his finger, " the more massive, and&#xD;
cumbrous workmansh      of Nature !  How&#xD;
grand and stern she is in a scene like this !"&#xD;
" I see no sublimity in towering rocks and&#xD;
bold crags ; at least, not here," answered Se-&#xD;
bastian, averting his eyes after a hurried&#xD;
glance at the points indicated. "I confess&#xD;
that a chilling awe creeps over me."&#xD;
" That comes of the force of association."&#xD;
returned Pathaway. "You have in your re-&#xD;
membrance the tale frequently alluded to by&#xD;
our friend, the trapper. Many places, grand&#xD;
and interesting naturally, become terrible by&#xD;
circumstances ; a spot where a murder has&#xD;
been committed, for instance. Cast your eyes&#xD;
across that dark sheet of, water and, observe&#xD;
how those stony peaks are graduated,' one ris-&#xD;
ing above another as they recede from the ba-&#xD;
sin. We have only to have lights and figures&#xD;
moving from crag to crag, to finish a wild and&#xD;
romantic picture.".&#xD;
Sebastian looked up at the hunter to see if&#xD;
he meant more than his words implied; but&#xD;
his was not a countenance easily read ; it was&#xD;
always calm and thoughtful, save when fired&#xD;
up by wrong or danger, when his mouth grew&#xD;
firmerin its significance, and his eyes beamed&#xD;
with courage and determination.&#xD;
" That stream is to me black and fearful !"&#xD;
Sebastian answered, "and the riven rocks, the&#xD;
looming ledges, and the pointed peaks are&#xD;
weird and threatening."&#xD;
The youth made a gesture toward the ob-&#xD;
jects spoken of as he severally mentioned&#xD;
them. The, gray hunter did not respond to&#xD;
this remark, keeping his eyes fixed upon the&#xD;
beetling rocks.&#xD;
"1I am almost certain," he said anon, " that&#xD;
I saw a human figure on yonder bluff."&#xD;
"It cannot be; it was but a creation of&#xD;
fancy," Sebastian replied, with a shudder.&#xD;
".I know that the eve is easily deceived, es-&#xD;
pecially at night, in a-spot where the imagina-&#xD;
tion has free scope to roam."&#xD;
He stopped, then exclaimed :&#xD;
" It was no deception ! There it is again!&#xD;
Now it is out of sight."&#xD;
"A mountain goat, perhaps ; the spot does.&#xD;
not a appear accessible to men," said the youth.&#xD;
" ou are mistaken. If my judgment does&#xD;
&#xD;
not err, that is the very place where the out-&#xD;
laws entered the basin, bearing their helpless&#xD;
and lovely victim. What a sceneit mut have&#xD;
been, as they defiled into the valley, and stood&#xD;
by the stream, the torches gleaming in the&#xD;
foreground, the woman kneeling with out-&#xD;
stretched hands, and in the back-ground,&#xD;
grouped together, the accomplices of the act.&#xD;
What powerful motives could have led to the&#xD;
perpetration of such a deed ?"&#xD;
"" The bad passions of men," Sebastian re-&#xD;
plied, in a voice scarcely articulate, while the&#xD;
dark face of Indian Joe was thrust forward to&#xD;
drink in every word with an inquisitive inter-&#xD;
est that was unusual for one of his race to ex-&#xD;
hibit.&#xD;
"There is a Power that often thwarts the&#xD;
base purposes of man, which was strikingly&#xD;
displayed in this instance. Nick informs me,"&#xD;
lie added, regarding Sebastian steadily, " that&#xD;
the womanwas beautiful. As you have been&#xD;
with the trapper a long time, you doubtless&#xD;
saw her. Was she then so handsome, good&#xD;
youth ?&#xD;
Sebastian hesitated, while a faint color stole&#xD;
to his cheeks.&#xD;
Indian Joe's dark orbs were leveled at the&#xD;
boy with all their deep and mysterious inten-&#xD;
sity.                    -&#xD;
" I saw her," he said, stammering, "and&#xD;
though many were pleased to think her beau-&#xD;
tiful, I did not fall in love with her face."&#xD;
"Her figure ?" queried Pathaway.&#xD;
" Being but a boy, I am no judge of such&#xD;
matters," added Sebastian, with affected play-&#xD;
fulness. " I never heard any one -fault her&#xD;
form. She certainly had no reason to com-&#xD;
plain of the gifts of Nature."&#xD;
Joe's brow now knitted into a. frown, and&#xD;
the long, delicate lashes that fringed his eyes&#xD;
quivered with some secret emotion.&#xD;
" I am talking while I should be acting,"&#xD;
said Pathaway. "It will not be well to allow&#xD;
an enemy to surprise one who is no novice in&#xD;
woodcraft. I must reconnoitre yonder rocks."&#xD;
The hunter paused, and looked toward Joe,&#xD;
as if at a loss to know what disposition to make&#xD;
of him.&#xD;
" Go with you," he said, comprehending the&#xD;
glance with that quickness which was charac-&#xD;
teristic of him.&#xD;
" No, you must stay with-with Sebastian."&#xD;
The youth had regarded the gray hunter&#xD;
more than once with a singular admixture of&#xD;
doubt, curiosity, and alarm. It seemed to him&#xD;
that the tones of the man's voice had changed&#xD;
-that they were more respectful and gentle.&#xD;
Deference Was what he had never  before&#xD;
shown him, however kind and friendly his&#xD;
manner.&#xD;
" I will return in a moment," said the hun-&#xD;
ter, and had walked several yards toward the&#xD;
stream, when the report of a carbiie disturbed&#xD;
the silence of the basin. Pathaway Staggered&#xD;
and fell. Sebastian sprang to his side, and&#xD;
&#xD;
either through terror, the weakness incident&#xD;
to his wound, or both combined, sank insen-&#xD;
sible to the ground.  I&#xD;
Pathway imnediately arose, and perceiv-&#xD;
ing what had happened to the youth, caught&#xD;
him in his arms and hurried to a spot more&#xD;
sheltered from the aim of an enemy. As he&#xD;
hastened forward, he looked furtively over his&#xD;
shoulder and saw a little cloud of smoke rising&#xD;
from the crag where he had seen the figure.&#xD;
" He is dead ! they have killed him I" mur-&#xD;
mured Sebastian, almost indistinctly, as he&#xD;
slowly recovered.&#xD;
" No ! he lives ; he is with you !" said Path-&#xD;
away.&#xD;
The lad opened his eyes with a bewildered&#xD;
air, and seeing himself supported by the hun-&#xD;
ter, gently disengaged himself.&#xD;
"I heard a report and thought you had&#xD;
fallen. It could not have been fancy," Sebas-&#xD;
tian added, not yet quite certain what had&#xD;
happened.&#xD;
" I was struck by a spent ball, but am un-&#xD;
injured."&#xD;
"This wound, I believe, makes a child of&#xD;
me," replied Sebastian, with a forced smile.&#xD;
" My flesh, evidently, does not heal so readily&#xD;
as represented by Nick."&#xD;
"1I have observed' you attentively, my lad,&#xD;
and am sure that you have suffered much.&#xD;
Your hands,"he continued, taking the youth's&#xD;
in his, " are feverish.  You have not com-&#xD;
plained enough."&#xD;
The boy Joe tossed his head and dilated his&#xD;
nostrils with unequivocal contempt.&#xD;
"Blood mixed !" he muttered. "Weak--&#xD;
faint like squaw-child! Young Ingin go on&#xD;
trail; git bullet git arrow-almost kil -no&#xD;
cry !"  Then hinting at Sebastian : "le&#xD;
better put on gown like white woman."&#xD;
" Be silent, boy !" said Pathaway, with a&#xD;
rebuking glance. " If your warriors do not&#xD;
complain of wounds, neither do they talk&#xD;
much. - The young men and youths who have.&#xD;
never been on the war-path keep mute tongues&#xD;
in the presence of their superiors."&#xD;
Joe turned his back moodily to Pathaway,&#xD;
but did not cease to-cast occasionally disdain-&#xD;
ful looks at Sebastian, and there might have&#xD;
been in them a portioniof hatred. The height-&#xD;
ened color of the lad told how keenly-he felt&#xD;
the taunts of Joe. Spurred perhaps by his&#xD;
derision, possibly because his injury gave him&#xD;
less pain, he arose and declared himself entire-&#xD;
ly recovered from his recent ill feelings, which&#xD;
-he. attributed partly to loss of blood, partly&#xD;
to the sudden shock of seeing Pthaway pros-&#xD;
trated by the aim of a lurking foe.&#xD;
" I'm sorry," he said, with a singular dis-&#xD;
play of spirit, " that! my rifle was stolen; for&#xD;
according to present appearances, I shall have&#xD;
occasion to use it ; andI tell oil, Colonel, I&#xD;
can shoot quite well. You doubt it, I see, but&#xD;
I will convince you at the first opportunity&#xD;
that offers."&#xD;

&#xD;
"No Ingin--no bad white man come ; you&#xD;
kill 'em quick !"said Joe, looking at Seas-&#xD;
tian's bow and quiver, which had fallen upon&#xD;
the ground a few yards distant.&#xD;
".he bow and arrow," said Pathaway; com-&#xD;
ing to the rescue," are instruments not to be&#xD;
desjaised. Your own people, tawny Joe, have&#xD;
used them with geat effect. I'n not disposed&#xD;
to alight the eaims of the bow, which was&#xD;
one:ot the primitive weapons of mankind, in&#xD;
vogpe long before the rifle and powder were&#xD;
dreanmed of."&#xD;
"Joe," observed Sebastian, "is in ill temper.&#xD;
He is little pleased with the severity of Nick,&#xD;
but his limbs being now free, I see no reason&#xD;
that he should murmur."&#xD;
The young Indian deigned no reply.&#xD;
Nick and Portneuf were heard approaching.&#xD;
"Who fired ?" asked the former, quickly.&#xD;
.:Some one hidden among yonder cliffs,"&#xD;
Pathaway replied.&#xD;
"2Nobody hurt, I hope ? We shall have&#xD;
enopgh to 'tend to 'thout ,lookin' arter gun-&#xD;
shot wounds."     ,,&#xD;
";A spent ball struck me upon the side, or&#xD;
ratherupon the metallic handle of my hunt-&#xD;
ing knife, doing .o other harm than prostrat-&#xD;
ing me by the shook."&#xD;
" That's fortinit I We can't afford to lose&#xD;
man nor, oy at present. The' critters, I be-&#xD;
liens, haven't diskivered the natril way to&#xD;
Bla k Run; but it 'pears they're comm' down&#xD;
the rocks yonder, for it couldn't been a chance&#xD;
shot that struck you. Dick Hendricks is in&#xD;

up and stirrih'. I should like to draw a bead&#xD;
on some ont'em, by righty! There'll be warm&#xD;

Whatever happens, .f you  e through it, I&#xD;
want you to keep a still tong , in your head,&#xD;
and; not let the p'ison newspapers it hold on't.&#xD;
What's the use o' bein' held up afore the pub-&#xD;
lic,,and turned over and over like a brile ? I&#xD;
swear to gracious," added Nick, taking an old&#xD;
cap from the tube of his rifle and replacing it&#xD;
by another, "if the pesky clearing's wasn't so&#xD;
far off, I'd go down with a load o' peltries, and&#xD;
buy up ha  a dozen of the condemned con-&#xD;
earns I"&#xD;
' I think no one has spoken ill of you in the&#xD;
clearings,"' said Pathaway.&#xD;
SI've lived 'cordin to my natur, and why&#xD;
should a person be spoke .ill of that's lived&#xD;
'cordin to his natur ? I never cheated nobody&#xD;
of what b'longed to him, nor sold peltry that&#xD;
waqtlegaly mine, nor shot a bufferler out o'&#xD;
waitonness, nor deserted a brother trapper in&#xD;
need, nor drawed bagk when there was danger,&#xD;
or rubbed out a heathen red-skin when self-&#xD;
preservation didn't demand it."&#xD;
"1Few of your brethren of the gun'and trap&#xD;
ean say as much," Patbaway replied.&#xD;
-1tacit consent, the two men walked a few&#xD;
from the rest of the parties.&#xD;
You saw no signs of pursuers near the&#xD;
&#xD;
cul-de-sac ?" said Pathaway, interrogative-&#xD;
ly.&#xD;
" Don't talk French, colonel, if you want to&#xD;
git information out o' me, for I never could&#xD;
talk much with the Monsbeers ; though I've&#xD;
picked up a few words here and there from the&#xD;
French vo a eu    Howsomnever, to come to&#xD;
the pint, I diskred nothin' to excite s'pi-,&#xD;
cion that they'd found the entrance to Black&#xD;
Run. But as Seven-Plumes, Bill Brace, Hen-&#xD;
dricks and his crew are on our trail, we can't&#xD;
expect to remain long undisturbed. If there&#xD;
wasn't but one Ingin in the business, we could&#xD;
hope to outwit 'em with less trouble ; but&#xD;
they've got their orders to swarm into every&#xD;
hidin'-place, pass, valley, gulch, perarie, and&#xD;
timber in the whole o' this region."&#xD;
While Nicholas was speaking, Pathaway was&#xD;
thinking of Sebastian. At one moment he was&#xD;
tempted to tell frankly his suspicions concern-&#xD;
ing the sex of the youth ; but, he inwardly&#xD;
queried, would it be kind to refer to a subject&#xD;
which Nick took so much pains to conceal ?&#xD;
Again there was a possibility of mistake. The&#xD;
assertion of Indian Joe might be false ; 'and&#xD;
yet that could scarcely be, for there were in-&#xD;
numerable little circumstances to confirm it.&#xD;
He resolved that he would be silent, at least&#xD;
for the present, well assured that Sebastian&#xD;
was not what his garb would indicate. -&#xD;
" The lives of those with us and our own be-&#xD;
ing at stake, how shall we escape the toils 'f&#xD;
our enemies ?" Pathaway asked.&#xD;
"I thought," answer ed Nick, "pervidin' we&#xD;
reached this. place, we should be safe ; but you&#xD;
observe that human calkilations isn't callers to&#xD;
be depended on. A nice hidin' spot is this&#xD;
under common car cumstances ; but as luck'll&#xD;
have it, Hendricks knows the way down yon-&#xD;
der rocks. Turn your eyes to that crag that&#xD;
stands out so square and bold. Well, 'twas on&#xD;
that -that I see the two men, Hendricks and&#xD;
Bill Brace, appear with-their torches on a sar-&#xD;
tin night that I've mentioned afore. I remem-&#xD;
ber how they looked wavin' 'em, to make the&#xD;
glare fall upon the basin and on the surround-&#xD;
i' rocks. He wore, a red sash, Cap'n Dick&#xD;
did. Arter stannin there a minute, grim and&#xD;
onnat'ral, as 'twere, they vanished from sight, }&#xD;
to start up ag'in presently, more to the right,&#xD;
where you see the peaks gradooated one above&#xD;
another, like stairs. They toiled down slow&#xD;
and keerful, did Brace and Hendricks, with the&#xD;
four ruffians ahind 'em bringin' the lovely gal.&#xD;
I can very well recollect how the torches sunk&#xD;
and rose ag'in, as they wound down the rough&#xD;
way."&#xD;
"I would like to know," said Pathaway, ear-&#xD;
nestly, "what became of that woman ?"&#xD;
" 'm wandering' from my siubjeck," answer-&#xD;
ed Nick, hurriedly. " You want to know what&#xD;
shall we do? '11 give ye' my pinionn, then&#xD;
I'll hear your'n. Bear in mind, colonel, that&#xD;
you've been fired at, which couldn't happened&#xD;
if you hadn't been seen. Well, that's a dis-&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
PATHAWAY ; OR, TlE MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS.     87&#xD;
&#xD;
kivery, I allow, so that we're no longer hid,&#xD;
but found. Now, what can we do, hemmed up&#xD;
in this little pocket, with Ingins and whites&#xD;
prowlin' in the rocks all round us ?"&#xD;
" And I might ask, too, what we shall do in&#xD;
the open country with the whole pack on our&#xD;
trail ?"&#xD;
" We can't trust to speed," said Nick, slow-&#xD;
ly.- " No, no ; speed won't do ; we must put&#xD;
eunnin' ag'in cunnin'. If our enemies are wise&#xD;
as serpents, we must be wiser. - We must blind&#xD;
their eyes."&#xD;
" W ere you and I alone interested in this&#xD;
matter, we should have little to fear; but there&#xD;
are other lives, Nicholas-Sebastian and poor&#xD;
Andrew Jeanjean."&#xD;
" Nick was in the act of replying, when a fig-&#xD;
ure emerged from the narrow pass and ap-&#xD;
proached them. It was Multnomah, the Shos-&#xD;
hons chief. His countenance was grave, his&#xD;
manner dignified.&#xD;
" Has Doubledark forgotten the words of&#xD;
the Shoshons ?" he asked. "Does he scorn to&#xD;
go where the birds build their nests ?"&#xD;
61I come here, Ingin, because I thought the&#xD;
place little known to white or red-skin, and&#xD;
would be a good spot to leave the houses, least-&#xD;
wise. The words of Multnomah are not like&#xD;
the wind that blows on unheeded ; they're laid&#xD;
up here."' Nick touched his head.&#xD;
" Seven-Plumes has told his young men, his&#xD;
women and children, that there will be a scalp-&#xD;
dance at his village before many days. The&#xD;
Blackfeet boys are gathering sticks to light&#xD;
many fires."&#xD;
"Let 'em gather 'em!'1 retorted Nick, con-&#xD;
tracting his brows. "They'd better put 'em&#xD;
under kiver to keep 'em dry ; for it'll belong,&#xD;
in my 'pinion, afore they use 'em on flesh o'&#xD;
mine. The Master of Lif didn't make me for&#xD;
fire-wood; if lie had, I should been drier and&#xD;
more combustible. As for the matter o' skulp,&#xD;
mine was made to be'carried on my head, and&#xD;
not on a pole ; leastwise, not on sich a pole as&#xD;
the varmints parade their trophies on..  don't&#xD;
feel consarned for myself; for I know that&#xD;
both savage and civilized fear this long bit o'&#xD;
iron which can carry death a hundred rods.'&#xD;
I've p'inted it many and many a time, and it&#xD;
never let out its fire and smoke for -nothin';&#xD;
when it's voice was heerd, I know'd where to&#xD;
look for the bullet. It hasn't made all its&#xD;
speeches yet ; there's them not fur off as it&#xD;
must reason with and talk toit its own'riginal&#xD;
way."&#xD;
" The name of Doubledark is feared by his&#xD;
enemies," replied Multnomah. " Butrlook at&#xD;
the rattlesnake, who carries poison in his head,&#xD;
and is terrible when he bites ; where is his&#xD;
power when he is beset by the ants ; he&#xD;
writhes and darts his tongue in vain ; his ene-&#xD;
mies are so many that he cannot contend with&#xD;
them, and dies in agony. A cloud hangs over&#xD;
Black Rock ; before morning it will gather to&#xD;
a tempest; call your people and fly."&#xD;
&#xD;
The Shoshone spoke earnestly, almost au-&#xD;
thoritatively.&#xD;
"Yes, I'd made up my mind for that, Ingin,&#xD;
and was proposin' it to the colonel when you&#xD;
come. 1 shallcotnt on you, and I trust you&#xD;
won't desert us, for we need your quickeye&#xD;
and your true'rifle. The losses must be Ift&#xD;
they'll be as safe here as anywhere. What&#xD;
could the poor animiles do where we're goin'?&#xD;
Nothin'; they'd be a bother to us and no good&#xD;
to themselves ; for pasturage is mighty scarce,&#xD;
I allow, up thereaway." Nick pointed to the&#xD;
North, then joined Sebastian and .those that&#xD;
were with him.&#xD;
This conversation took place on the east&#xD;
side of the basin, and so far within the shadow&#xD;
of the inaccessible wall, that persons occur -&#xD;
ing the cliffs at the west would have been gift-&#xD;
ed with unusual sharpness of eyesight to see&#xD;
them. Multnomah 'awaited the return of the&#xD;
trapper silently ; and when he came, moved&#xD;
noiselessly toward the cut-de~sac, and was fol-&#xD;
lowed without questioning. They had walked,&#xD;
but a short distance, when Pathaway reecllect.&#xD;
ed that his hunting-knife had slipped from'its&#xD;
sheath 'while he was talking with Nick; he&#xD;
went back to recover it. As he stooped to take&#xD;
it from the ground, he saw a narrow niche in&#xD;
the wall of the rock, in which lay a; small&#xD;
package. Curiosity impelled him to take lit ;&#xD;
it was a beaver-skin wrapped carefully about&#xD;
something. He unrolled it; the wrapper con-&#xD;
tained, much to his surprise, the long, dark,&#xD;
shining tresses of a woman's hair. Holding&#xD;
up the silky threads to the t'aint moonlight, he&#xD;
examined them with mute eagerness, but not&#xD;
without many internal queries. U pon what&#xD;
head grew those wavy locks ? What hand&#xD;
severed and deposited them there? Did this&#xD;
strange waif pertain to the old mystery of&#xD;
Black Run, or was it a memento of some later.&#xD;
tragedy ? It seemed to him that he had seen&#xD;
tresses as soft and glossy. His lips moved ;&#xD;
he murmured something--'it might have been&#xD;
a name.&#xD;
- Hearing a footstep, lie thrust the hair be-&#xD;
heath his frock; and turning, with a start, be-&#xD;
held Nick Whiffes; he was embarrassed, 'and&#xD;
the hunter thought annoyed ; the latter met&#xD;
'his steady look with suddenly-heihtened col,&#xD;

strued into weakness. Neither spoke immedi-&#xD;
ately.  Nick was the first ,to  break si-&#xD;

"I didn't know it was the natur ofa white&#xD;

disturbance. "I allowed, colonel,. that you&#xD;
had a dispersition above cruelty; and not cru-&#xD;

The trapper hesitatingly extended hishand.&#xD;
"You yourself do not appear to be entirely&#xD;
regardless of trifles,". answered Pathaway,&#xD;
smiling.&#xD;
"It's mine," added Nick, gravely.""'If&#xD;

Nick and the Shoshone whispered together,  At that moment, an object floated down the&#xD;

stream ; every eye was riveted upon it. Part&#xD;
of a red face, some feathers, and a tufted scalp-&#xD;
lock, were' for a brief time visible.&#xD;
" One diffikilty the less !" said Nick, quietly.&#xD;
"He was a foolish young warrior, to follow&#xD;
Doubledark," said the Shoshone. " His eyes&#xD;
were blinded, or he'd known the trail of Dou-&#xD;
bledark is a long trail."&#xD;
" You're right, Ingin ; thus far, my trail&#xD;
has been long for them as looked for me to my&#xD;
hurt. 'Twould been short enough if the&#xD;
heathen'had had their way;. but I've an eye&#xD;
and an ear for 'etm that shortens their days.&#xD;
'Tisn't because I seek 'em that sich things&#xD;
happen. 'Tis'nt my natur to hurt nobody,&#xD;
but the Master o' Lite says to every one plainly&#xD;
enough: ' Take care o' yourself !' SNow if I&#xD;
didn't take care myself, who'd take care on&#xD;
me ?"&#xD;
While Nick was speaking, the Shoshone&#xD;
dragged a large canoe from the bushes, and&#xD;
launched it upon the stream.&#xD;
" Get in-get in !" said Nick. " Go fust,&#xD;
Sebastian, and you next, little Ingin. That's&#xD;
it ! Mind what you do, Jeanjean, or you'll tip&#xD;
the frail consarn over. You're the' boy for a&#xD;
paddle, Portneuf ; you used to drive a canoe&#xD;

shower-bath. for the thing won't tip if you keep&#xD;
quiet. A ship o' the line isn't safer nor an In-&#xD;
gin bark well managed,"&#xD;
The dogs, which, in obedience to the com-&#xD;
mand of their master, had crouched beside&#xD;
Sebastian, now stood on shore, looking wish-&#xD;
fully at Nick. '&#xD;
"Let the animiles get in," said the latter.&#xD;
"There's room enough, and they'll make- too&#xD;
much noise running' along the bank if we don't&#xD;
give 'em a chance with us. I never desart my&#xD;
dogs, Calamity, leastwise. He's been true to&#xD;
me, and I'll be the same to him. Once, when&#xD;
there was a cussed little diffikilty with the&#xD;
Ingins, and he was sick, and his legs was weak,&#xD;
I took him up and carried him in my arms.&#xD;
Many and many a step has them legs took for&#xD;
me ;   miles and miles have they trotted&#xD;
ahind me, my companions and my friends when&#xD;
there's nobody to speak to. I'd thank ye,"&#xD;
added Nick, unconsciously raising his voice,&#xD;
addressing Pathaway, if any one in particular,&#xD;
"jest to take a p'int blank look at them eyes ;&#xD;
.they a'n't blue nor black, nor like a woman's&#xD;
lookers ; but'they're mighty good dog's eyes,&#xD;
and have a heap of understannin' in 'em."&#xD;
Calamity's grizzly eyes twinkled inquiringly.&#xD;
There certainly were interrogation points in&#xD;
them.            ,&#xD;
"I don't say that his'n's a handsome head,&#xD;
but it's a honest one. He does snap 'easion-&#xD;
ally at Smuggler, and snubs him when he's too&#xD;
familiar, as 'twere ; and he will bite your&#xD;
legs if you tread on him ; but he's got quali-&#xD;
&#xD;
89&#xD;
&#xD;
ties that put him on a footin' with many var-&#xD;
mints that go on two feet instead o' four."&#xD;
The dogs sprang into the little vessel, and&#xD;
the chief, taking his place in the stern, sent it&#xD;
into the middle of the-stream with a stroke of&#xD;
his paddle. Portneuf aided his Pfforts, and the&#xD;
canoe shot onward like an arrow.'&#xD;
Trees fringed the bank, and, casting their&#xD;
branches over the water, were mirrored duskily&#xD;
upon its surface. As the paddles sank and tose4&#xD;
noiselessly, Nick, reclining in the bow of the&#xD;
birchen craft, with his rifle thrown forward&#xD;
across his arm, watched the coverts and the&#xD;
vistas on either side.&#xD;
Sebastian began to feel a sense of security,&#xD;
which Pathaway noticed with satisfaction, da&#xD;
was turning to express his thanks to -Multno-&#xD;
mah, when the war-cry of a Blackfoot, broke&#xD;
the, silence with a sharp and explosive disso-&#xD;
nance. The paddles of the Shoshons and the&#xD;
voyageur simultaneously backed water. The&#xD;
rifle of Nick Whiffles seemed to spring to his&#xD;
cheek by instinct, rather than to be placed&#xD;
there by his usually deliberate hands. The&#xD;
canoe vibrated and quivered on the stream, so&#xD;
abruptly was its momentum checked.. The&#xD;
long barrel had become fixed, and hurled forth&#xD;
its unerring messenger before a word' was&#xD;
spoken, or ere the quick eyes of Sebastian had&#xD;
discovered the object of his aim. The leaves&#xD;
stirred overhead and the rocks rang back the&#xD;
echo. Something fell into the stream, redden-&#xD;
ing its clhar surface. As the canoe swept on,&#xD;
Sebastian glanced backward, and beheld a long&#xD;
tuft-look trailing upon the water. For the&#xD;
next few seconds nothing was heard save the&#xD;
slight sound of the skillfully and rapidly fall'&#xD;
ing paddles.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
ON THH WATER.&#xD;
Each of the Northern adventurers expected&#xD;
to hear the thrilling war-cry of the Blackfoot&#xD;
answered from -many clamorous throats,;, but,&#xD;
the intermountain quietude remained unbro-&#xD;
ken. Neither wolf, prairie-dog, nor, panther'&#xD;
disturbed- the deep solitude. The canoe shot&#xD;
steadily onward. Considerable- time elapsed&#xD;
before the wily trapper perceptibly relaxed his&#xD;
vigilance of eye and ear, or thought it prudent'&#xD;
to trust the sound of his voice. It was now&#xD;
that Pathaway had opportunity to'observe him&#xD;
when peril impended ; to note 'his coolness&#xD;
the absence of hurry and perturbation from&#xD;
hit deportment, and to recognize the wonderful&#xD;
acuteness of his senses. For himself, he mani-&#xD;
fested no uneasiness; it wat only when his&#xD;
gaze rested upon the slight-figure of Sebastian&#xD;
that a wave of anxiety ruffled his- features.&#xD;
" The branches hang low," he muttered,&#xD;
raising his head, an'd speaking in those inde-&#xD;
scribable tones that are the true index of dpn-&#xD;
ger, "the branches hang low, and the trees&#xD;
stand thick together like platoons of soldiers.&#xD;

and I are on friendly- footin'; but on sich oe-&#xD;
.casions as this, I see the rows of trunks and&#xD;
the green follyage with distrust--a ereepin' of&#xD;

'Tisn't fear-you understan' the feelin', Sho-&#xD;

or what's more Christian and civilized, like an&#xD;
old free trapper, as I be."&#xD;
"What do von think ?" Pathaway asked,&#xD;
bending toward the hunter, and unconsciously,&#xD;
as it would seem, in his earnestness, placing&#xD;
his hand on Sebastian's shoulder.&#xD;
The youth shrank from the touch, then&#xD;
smiled at his own sensitiveness."&#xD;
Indian Joe flashed spitefully at the hunter&#xD;
as he withdrew his hand.&#xD;
" I think that my shootin'-tube spoke ray-&#xD;
ther loud, and must have been heerd by them&#xD;
that seek us ; but the simple crack of a rifle&#xD;
wouldn't locate us with any great sartinty,&#xD;
On the water We leave no trail, but if they dis-&#xD;
kiver the place where we launched this canoe,&#xD;
they'll be houndin' arter us afore long."&#xD;
" Do you not know," continued Pathaway,&#xD;
'some covert, nook, or hiding-place where&#xD;
this wounded lad can find safety ?"&#xD;
"I wish you and Nicholas would feel less&#xD;
care for me. Safety is worth no more to me&#xD;
than to you. This wound is comparatively of&#xD;
no account, only so far as it prevents me&#xD;
from-from   defending myself. It cannot, it&#xD;
shall not make me burdensome 1" exclaimed&#xD;
Sebastian.&#xD;
".Stop the craft, Ingin," said Nick, with a&#xD;
backward motion of his hand.&#xD;
"6Doubledark is a fox 1" answered the-Sho-&#xD;
shone.&#xD;
They had reached a spot where the banks&#xD;
were less thickly studded with trees, and which&#xD;
permitted a further range of vision. Nicholas&#xD;
pointed with his rifle to-a cluster of piion that&#xD;
was scarcely perceptible in the darkness and&#xD;
distance.&#xD;
" The eyes of Doubledark conquer the.&#xD;
'night!"'added Multnomah.&#xD;
"Put the birch ashore; chief."&#xD;
Pathaway strained his eyes, but saw nothing&#xD;
to render the clump of trees an object of sus-&#xD;
picion. 'The vessel touched the bank ; Nick&#xD;
sprang out.&#xD;
"Wait for me, redskin, and Ill soon bring&#xD;
you word whether the stream is'clear."&#xD;
" I will go also," said Pathaway, leaping to&#xD;
the bank.&#xD;
"No," replied the trapper, "I'm  afeard&#xD;
your foot is not light enough. You're better&#xD;
used to the trail of four-footed animiles than&#xD;
to them with two."&#xD;
" I am- accustomed to an active life, and&#xD;
eannot-remain passive when there is danger,&#xD;
and action is. required. Lead on, Doubledark,&#xD;
and possibly you'll think less lightly of my&#xD;
-skill.p,&#xD;
&#xD;
"I know you're mighty good at some things,&#xD;
colonel; but approachin' an inemy at his bi-&#xD;
vouae is a different matter from stannin' bold-&#xD;
l up to a danger that's right afore ye, and&#xD;
on't need to be unmasked."&#xD;
" I a not a novice, and do insist upon shar-&#xD;
ing my proportion of danger," returned Patha-&#xD;
way, with firmness.&#xD;
" Well, you're a handy lad, and I allow can&#xD;
be trusted-where others would be in the way."&#xD;
Without further discussion, Nick started off&#xD;
at a quick pace, followed by Pathaway. Hd&#xD;
the ground been even, the distance to the&#xD;
piiion would have been quickly and easily ac-&#xD;
complished ; but being rough and unequal, the&#xD;
task  was not, unattended with difficulty.&#xD;
Gliding through grass and bushes without&#xD;
effort, apparently, Nicholas reached the mar-&#xD;
gin of the timber ; before which time the gray&#xD;
hunter had discovered light puffs of smoke&#xD;
occasionally mounting against the sky, or&#xD;
drifting fitfully along the tops of the trees.&#xD;
"Many eyes might be deceived," observed&#xD;
Nicholas, "and mistake that smoke for a vapor&#xD;
risin' front the ground ; but it's real smoke&#xD;
coming' from a fire kindled with dry leaves and&#xD;
sticks, fed slowly by experienced hands, to keep&#xD;
a clear flame. We of the wilderness under-&#xD;
stant these things, you see."&#xD;
"It is smoke, without question," the other&#xD;
replied.,&#xD;
"I won't tell ye to be cautious, 'cause you've&#xD;
sense enough to know that we must be serpent&#xD;
like when w9're dealin' with the heathen that&#xD;
make tricks and stratagems a part o' their&#xD;
life. Come on, colonel, and show your p'ints."&#xD;
Throwing forward his thin and supple body,&#xD;
the trapper pushed his way into.the timber.&#xD;
His form had lost none of its more youthful&#xD;
vigor. The muscles had grown stronger with&#xD;
exercise, and toil had consolidated bone and&#xD;
sinew.&#xD;
While the hunter admired his noiseless loco-&#xD;
motion, he strove in vain to equal it.&#xD;
"You do 'mazin' well, colonel," he whis-&#xD;
pered ; "but a stick will sometimes crack and&#xD;
a bush shake with the most skillful of us.&#xD;
You'll git the knackon't with practice. Hist !&#xD;
We're clost onto 'em, by mighty !"\&#xD;
Nick's long finger was pointed to an open-&#xD;
ing in the trees, and Pathaway following its di-&#xD;
rection, saw dusky figures sitting by a fire so&#xD;
small that the blaze could have been covered&#xD;
by one's hand. Nicholas made a warning ges-&#xD;
ture to the hunter, and again moved on, with&#xD;
his knees to the earth and his rifle thrown out&#xD;
before him.&#xD;
Several minutes passed before they attained&#xD;
a position offering them a full view of the&#xD;
group.&#xD;
" Look!" said Nick, grasping Pathaway by&#xD;
the arm, ano putting hislips to his ear. "See&#xD;
that varmint with his back partly toward us ?&#xD;
It's Jack Wiley! The p'ison critter's forgot&#xD;
the service I done him. If it hadn't been for&#xD;

t&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
me, his skulp would be hangin' this minute in&#xD;
a Blackfoot lodge !"&#xD;
The trapper threw his rifle a trifle more in&#xD;
advance, and laid his cheek to the breech.&#xD;
"A nice chance! a nice chance !" he mut-&#xD;
tered. "What a pity the airth can't be re-&#xD;
lieved of sich a mean skunk immejiate ! Ah,&#xD;
colonel ! how human natur is sometimes put&#xD;
to it for patience !"&#xD;
The object of the hunter's remarks turned&#xD;
his face to the fire in addressing one of his&#xD;
savage comrades ; Pathaway recognized it at&#xD;
once.&#xD;
"They've killed some kind o' game lately,&#xD;
most likely, and have stopped to cook and eat.&#xD;
Huge feeders are Ingins, though they can fast&#xD;
when worst comes to worst. If you'd jest&#xD;
tried your skill on his 'ug'lar art'ries when you&#xD;
had him tied at Trapjer Trace, you wouldn't&#xD;
been guilty o' no great crime."&#xD;
Pathaway had frequently seen Indians in&#xD;
their war-paint, but never so completely&#xD;
changed from the common form of humanity&#xD;
as these. There were eight of them, most&#xD;
wickedly bedaubed and metamorphosed with&#xD;
various pigments and savage arts. Their visa-&#xD;
ges, As lighted up by the tremulous blaze,&#xD;
were truly startling.  Pathaway thought of&#xD;
Sebastian, and experienced painful anxiety for&#xD;
his safety.&#xD;
" I've drawed a bead on him," said Nick,&#xD;
whose ire was excited by the treachery of Wi-&#xD;
ley. '"Shall I pull trigger, colonel?"'&#xD;
"No, no I" whispered Pathaway.   "Such&#xD;
an act would be folly. Calm yourself!"&#xD;
" I couldn't be calmer; and not that, neither,&#xD;
for I'm stirred up in'ardly. Fine company he's&#xD;
in, isn't he ?  What's more frightful nor an&#xD;
Ingin in his'paint; to them, I mean, that isn't&#xD;
'customed to the sight. - But whatis it?  On'y&#xD;
a little red and white clay with a streak o'&#xD;
black in't. Sich contrivances may do for wo-&#xD;
men and children, boys' leastwise ; -but full&#xD;
growed men, of whatsomnever color, should be&#xD;
'bove it. Bunt it's their natur', and that's all&#xD;
we can say. Eight of 'em besides Wiley, and-&#xD;
quite near the stream, too. You can jes'&#xD;
ketch a glimpse on't runnin' like a silver&#xD;
thread out yender.. Wonder how we shall git&#xD;
by? We can try it, and if they sight us we've&#xD;
the consolation o' knowing' we've four good&#xD;
rifles."&#xD;
The hunter made no answer, but watched&#xD;
the grim group with breathless interest. A&#xD;
noise, so very slight that it was scarcely audi-&#xD;
ble, caused him to' look backward over his&#xD;
shoulder ; behind him stood the dog Calamity, s&#xD;
with his nose uplifted, and his large eyes fixed&#xD;
with striking intensity upon the savages, the I&#xD;
hairs on his head and back erect and bristling.&#xD;
" The dog has come I" said the hunter.   a&#xD;
oI know it," returned Nicholas.  "He'sv&#xD;
been stannin' ahind ye some time, but don't be s&#xD;
skeerd ; he's slier and more cat-like nor you g&#xD;
be.' The critter's follered me miles on the&#xD;
&#xD;
trail 'thout disturbin' a leaf, and nothin' suits&#xD;
him better. He isn't interested in common&#xD;
doin's, he isn't, but is in his element when&#xD;
there's danger. Obsarve," added Nick, in the&#xD;
same low whisper in which the conversation&#xD;
had been carried on, " how fierce - his eves&#xD;
glow ! He's brave, I allow ! At a motion' of&#xD;
my finger he'd fly into the midst of 'em, and&#xD;
like it amazin'. ButtI s'pose we might as well&#xD;
creep back, for our arrant seems to be done.&#xD;
Turn tail, Calamity, and heave ahead !"&#xD;
CHAPT74 RWXXVI.&#xD;
THE nRFUGE.&#xD;
Nick stepped silently into the canoe. The&#xD;
Shoshon6 glanced at the trapper's uncom-&#xD;
municative face and patiently waited for him&#xD;
to speak.&#xD;
" Eight of 'em," said Nick, turning his eyes&#xD;
anxiously to the east.   "Eight, and Jack&#xD;
Wiley is with -'em. Daylight is coin' and&#xD;
their fire burns well down to the bank, but&#xD;
we'll try it, Ingin. It's runnin' the g'antlet,&#xD;
as 'twere, but that I've done afore. Step&#xD;
aboard, colonel. 'Twas 'mong the Crows that&#xD;
I run the g'antlet, Shoshond. I's fresh in the&#xD;
trappin'-grounds, then.^ I could took care o'&#xD;
myself well 'nough if I'd been alone and&#xD;
hadn't had a young feller with me, who wls-&#xD;
new from the big elearin's and not up to the&#xD;
ways o' the kentry. His hose was shot under&#xD;
him andhe was wounded in the leg. Recol-&#xD;
lect mighty well how he looked as he sot ,on&#xD;
the ground, the picter o' despair."&#xD;
" g This is the last o' me, Nick,' sez he.&#xD;
' I've got to die,' sez he.&#xD;
"' I'm afeard so,!' sez I.&#xD;
"'I've got brethers and sisters that'll cry&#xD;
for me,' sez he, ' and a mother, too,' sex he.&#xD;
"You can't tell how the word 'mother'&#xD;
started me ; it tetched somethin' tender in my&#xD;
nature . Is mounted on a hoss as swift as the&#xD;
wind ; Suggestion his name was ; an odd&#xD;
name, but a good critter. If you should ever&#xD;
meet Buck Bison, Ingin, he'll tell ye the p'ints&#xD;
o' that animile.&#xD;
"'Jim,' sez I, 'I've got no mother to cry&#xD;
for me!' And with that I leaped from Sug-&#xD;
gestion's back quicker'n a wink. The Crows&#xD;
was then pesky nigh, mounted .most of 'em,&#xD;
and yellin' like a hundred catamounts.&#xD;
"' There shan't be no weepin' for you, Jim,'&#xD;
sez I, 'if I can help it,' takin' him frofn the&#xD;
ground and puttin' him into the saddle in halt&#xD;
a second.&#xD;
"'Good God, Nick! What are you doin'?'&#xD;
sez he.&#xD;
"' Take the reins,' sez I, 'and if there's&#xD;
Koss-flesh that Can save you, it's under ye.'&#xD;
" You never seed sick -a 'stonished look, I&#xD;

that came back to me as the hoss whirled him&#xD;
away."&#xD;
"And you, Nick, and you ?" interrogated&#xD;
Sebastian.&#xD;
Nicholas smoothed his beard, made a mo-&#xD;
tion to the Shoshons, and quietly answered :&#xD;
" I sot down on the ground where Jim had&#xD;
been a moment afore, with my arms aside me.&#xD;
In the fury of pursuit, two thirds o' the var-&#xD;
mints galloped by me ; but presently I was&#xD;
diskivered and surrounded with red faces,&#xD;
tufted heads, guns, and tomahawks. I fought&#xD;
'em, and there was a few losses that scamp-&#xD;
ered off 'thout a' redskin to ride 'em. There&#xD;
was vellin's and hootin's, I swear to gracious 1&#xD;
I's taken, in course, as I told ye, and there&#xD;
was great rejoicin's. When we reached the&#xD;
Crow campI's obleeged to run atween two&#xD;
rows o' warriors, armed with all sorts o' wee-&#xD;
pons, to be used for my benefit. Soon's they'd&#xD;
placed me and told me to run, I leaped up&#xD;
like a wounded bufferler, 'lighted on the head&#xD;
and shoulders of a copperskm, wrenched away&#xD;
his weepon, and cleared a path through the&#xD;
varmints like lightnin'. In less'n half a min-&#xD;
ute I's'in the timber, with the whole Nor'west&#xD;
afore me. My friends was surprised to see me&#xD;
come into camp, havin' give me up' for lost."&#xD;
"And the young man ?" said Sebastian, in-&#xD;
quiringly.&#xD;
" Was safe and sound, savin' the little gun-&#xD;
shot diffikilty in his leg. Gunshot diffikilties&#xD;
A'n't alleys mortal, little 'un ; I've had 'em,&#xD;
hind I know what they be. Keep nearer the&#xD;
right bank, Shoshone ; the closer we git to it&#xD;
the better it'll be, for the sarpents '1l be more&#xD;
likely to look over us."&#xD;
Nicholas.raised his long slim neck, and east&#xD;
a calculating eye toward the growth of pinon.&#xD;
"'Twas a noble act !" said Delaunay, with&#xD;
enthusiasm.&#xD;
" Shoshone, you can see them little' puffs&#xD;
misting up through the trees; other eyes might&#xD;
mistake 'em for wreaths of fog, but you and&#xD;
I, chief, know better. And the colonel, too,&#xD;
has an eye and a mighty knack, I allow.&#xD;
Frenchman, raise your paddle and let the&#xD;
birch drift ; the Ingin will guide it; it's his&#xD;
natur' to manage a canoe."&#xD;
There were signs of the coming day in the&#xD;
east-a faint tinge low down on the horizon ;&#xD;
a soft glow between the earth and sky.&#xD;
"1Now bend low, all of ye, and screen your&#xD;
heads as much as possible 1" suggested the&#xD;
ever-earefuliNick.&#xD;
"Let your head sink a little lower," whisp-&#xD;
ered Iathaway to Sebastian Delaunay. " It&#xD;
offers a mark to an enemy."&#xD;
"Why should I fear an enemy more than&#xD;
you ?" he answered. " I am sure you offer a&#xD;
better target to a marksman than I."&#xD;
"I care not ; I am wont to danger ; but&#xD;
yoti, you--"&#xD;
Pathaway paused.&#xD;
Sebastian looked up with a start.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Caution is better nor courage," said Nick&#xD;
Whiffles. "'Tis here, leastwise."&#xD;
The canoe floated steadily toward the point&#xD;
of danger. The stream fell off as they pro-&#xD;
ceeded, and the current grew quicker. Here&#xD;
and there white water and a broken surface&#xD;
told where rocks were hidden, but the Sho-&#xD;
shone, with a motion of his paddle, sent the&#xD;
vessel this way or that, shunning the danger-&#xD;
ous spots with the skill and ease of long prac.&#xD;
tice.&#xD;
As they neared the pines, each mind was&#xD;
natui'ally expectant. Even the face of Nick&#xD;
became more intense in expression, and the&#xD;
manner of the Shoshons more wary and absorb-&#xD;
ed in his employment. Gently the light craft&#xD;
drifted on. They were passing the fire, when it&#xD;
was drawn into an eddy and whirled around&#xD;
several times. Pathaway believed discovery&#xD;
inevitable. Glancing shoreward, he saw dusky&#xD;
forms, some sitting, and some standing ; Jack&#xD;
Wiley was prominent in the group.  It was&#xD;
manifest, from  the sudden  contraction of&#xD;
Nick's brows, that he, too, saw the same spec-&#xD;
tacle.  The canoe rocked, swayed to and fro,&#xD;
trembled an instant, then shot from the circling&#xD;
waters into the current, governed by the po-&#xD;
tent hand of the Shoshon6.&#xD;
Some time elapsed before a word was spok-&#xD;
en, during which the aria, of Portneuf aided&#xD;
in propelling the vessel. The roaring of a&#xD;
fall was heard, and the chief turned the canoe&#xD;
to the shore, which in that place was sterile&#xD;
and rocky.&#xD;
" Git out-hide .canoe--go no further by&#xD;
water," he said.&#xD;
The parties stepped out upon the rocks. In&#xD;
obedience to the direction of the chief, Nick&#xD;
and Portneuf lifted the canoe upon their&#xD;
shoulders, and carrying it several rods, stop-&#xD;
ped at the fall. The stream, which was nar-&#xD;
row, was still narrower there The water fell&#xD;
over the ledge some six feet in a clear, un-&#xD;
broken sheet. Under this fall the canoe Was&#xD;
thrust, and the water, shooting over it, effec-&#xD;
tuallv concealed it from view.&#xD;
" Nobody but an Ingin," said Nick, "or&#xD;
some one that knowed Ingin ways, would&#xD;
thought of sich a hidin'-place.  But there&#xD;
you see 'tis, with a ledge shelvin' over it, and&#xD;
the watery elements coverin' it like a blanket.&#xD;
Which way now, chief, forwe trust this mat-&#xD;
ter wholly to you ?"&#xD;
" This way,'' answered Multnomah, "One&#xD;
at a time, and step as I do."&#xD;
"One at a time means Ingin file ; and by&#xD;
steppin' as he does, means to tread in his&#xD;
tracks ; and not in his tracks neither, 'cause he&#xD;
won't make none ; but to put your feet where&#xD;
he puts his'n. Don't step too long, Shoshon6,&#xD;
for Sparrer-Legs hasn't a long span of the leg&#xD;
as 'twere."      --&#xD;
A single ray of sunlight darted across the&#xD;
ranges, falling like a trail of gold toward the&#xD;
west.&#xD;
&#xD;
PATHAWAY ; OR, THE MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
" See !" said Multnomah, "the Master of&#xD;
Life sends us a guide. 'Tis a good sign, Dou-&#xD;
bledark, and we'll follow it."'&#xD;
"Sartin ! sartin !" said Nick.  Then to&#xD;
Pathaway, apologetically: "'Tis the natur' of&#xD;
a heathen to b'lieve in signs, omens, and mani-&#xD;
tos, and I a'n't sure but they're right. Why&#xD;
shouldn't they be ? Don't-they live the near-&#xD;
est to natur'? Isn't natur' pooty much as the&#xD;
Great Spirit made it ?"&#xD;
"I'm  not much of a causist !" responded&#xD;
Pathaway.&#xD;
" I don't know what that may happen to be,&#xD;
colonel, nor I don't keer much ; but it stan s&#xD;
ye in hand to know more nor I do on 'count&#xD;
o' your book-larnin'."&#xD;
" My sweetheartwas a prairie-flower,&#xD;
She dwelt beside the flowing water-;&#xD;
I wooed her in her wildwood bower,&#xD;
I loved the wandering trapper's daughter.&#xD;
Oh, the trapper's daughter !"&#xD;
It was the voice of Andrew Jeanjean, sing-&#xD;
ing. Nicholas sprang to stop him, but the&#xD;
strain was so soft and musical, and vibrated so&#xD;
plaintively through the trees, that he could&#xD;
not find it in his heart to check him till the&#xD;
touching burden of his song had ceased.&#xD;
"I've got a new idee," said.the trapper,&#xD;
gently ; ".and not a new idee, neither, for I've&#xD;
carried it about in my thinkin' orgins sev'ril&#xD;
days. I'm goin' to operate on that critter's&#xD;
head, by mighty."&#xD;
The trapper levelled his long forefinger at&#xD;
Andrew.&#xD;
" Pistols, traps, peltries, buffaloes, and other&#xD;
things !" said Jeanjean, with his unmeaning&#xD;
face turned to Nick.&#xD;
" Jes' so ! jes' so !" responded Nick, nod-&#xD;
ding.^ "'Specially other things ! Dr. Whif-&#xD;
fles used to operate a sight on broken heads.&#xD;
He used to japan 'em; that is, take out a&#xD;
piece o' bone and clap in a piece o' silver in-&#xD;
stead on't."&#xD;
"That process is called trepanning, uncle&#xD;
Nick," said Sebastian.&#xD;
" I said trapannin'; and-right well the doe-&#xD;
tor knew how to do it. Now I don't 'tend to&#xD;
go the whole figger and put in a piece o' sil-&#xD;
ver, but just insart the p'int o' my knife and&#xD;
lift up the bone where it presses on the brain.&#xD;
I've got a steady hand, and I'm sure I can&#xD;
bring back his reason, or leave him no worse&#xD;
off nor I found him. I won't kill hini, least-&#xD;
wi'e. I've sounded the diffikilty with my fin-&#xD;
gers, and diskivered the skull pushed right&#xD;
down into the soft parts. I used to know the&#xD;
tetchnical names of the orgins. I ha'n't for-&#xD;
got the titles of the two milkbranes that the&#xD;
thinkin' fakilties is done up in, like blankets :&#xD;
one's called the p'ison-matter and 'tother the&#xD;
do-ye-matter."&#xD;
"The pia mater and dura mater, I think,"&#xD;
said Pathaway.&#xD;
"Sartin, so I said and so 'tis. I was well&#xD;
&#xD;
93&#xD;
&#xD;
varsed in these things when- I's with the old&#xD;
doctor that practiced Lobely. I know what&#xD;
he'd do, if he's here-not Dr. Whiffles, but the&#xD;
botany doctor-he'd give him a 'metie ; but I&#xD;
'don't 'magine 'twould start the skull an artom.&#xD;
No, no ! it wouldn't do it, though it has a&#xD;
great raisin' power so far as the stumieh is con-&#xD;
sarned. Tread carefully, sonny, and step in&#xD;
the same place. Ingin, don't take sich long&#xD;
strides ; the boy has a diflikilty in reachin'..&#xD;
He isn't set up so fur from the ground aqyou&#xD;
be, you know. Lower posted, so to speak0"&#xD;
For an hour or more, the Shoshons pursued&#xD;
a straight course over a hatd, unyielding soil,&#xD;
then, reaching the deep gulch, turned sudden-&#xD;
ly to the south. Nick and Pathaway looked&#xD;
at him inquiringly, but asked no questions.&#xD;
The gulch led them to a valley running to the&#xD;
east, which they followed till the sun was high&#xD;
in the, heavens. Sebastian and Indian Joe&#xD;
showed unmistakable signs of weariness, the&#xD;
former being supported the latter part of the&#xD;
way by Nick, and assisted by Pathaway when-&#xD;
ever the trapper afforded him an opportunity,&#xD;
which was - seldom. Joe began to lag, and&#xD;
Nicholas ffear'ng that he meditated leaving&#xD;
them, making fatigue a pretext to favor the&#xD;
design, made the dog Calamity, alias Misfor-&#xD;
tune, walk at his heels and keep guard, over&#xD;
his movements.&#xD;
The boy, clearly, entertained a great terror&#xD;
of the dog, and his muttered growls and dis-&#xD;
trusttul looks always had the effect to quicken&#xD;
his pace. Pathaway remnarked that he really&#xD;
seemed exhausted, and advised halting a few&#xD;
moments to give him needed rest.&#xD;
"An, Ingin boy git tired !" exclaimed;Niek,&#xD;
incredulously. "That's onreasonable, colonel.&#xD;
Redskin boys are calkilated mostly for run-&#xD;
nin'. He's makin' it, depend on't." Then to&#xD;
Joe, with threatening brow:&#xD;
"Come along, Little PisonI Don't play&#xD;
'possum with an old hunter. Look at Misfor-&#xD;
tin; he's a smilin' at ye from ahind ; he'll have&#xD;
hold o' your heels next."&#xD;
Joe - stopped:and supported himself by a&#xD;
tree, then his form sank, and he gradually slid&#xD;
down to the root, murmuring :&#xD;
"Ingin Joe tired ; no walk no more."&#xD;
Nick stepped back and deliberately raised&#xD;
the lad's head from his hands in which he had&#xD;
rested it.&#xD;
"What a set o' boys we've got, by mighty !&#xD;
The sarpint's cryin', or jest ready to, true's&#xD;
you live. You'll make a great warrior, won't&#xD;
you, sonny? 'Your name'll be famous 'mong&#xD;
your red brethren 'thout doubt !"&#xD;
"You are hard upon Joe," said Pathaw .&#xD;
" He is probably unused to walking. Child-&#xD;
ren among the Blackfeet are accustomed to&#xD;
ride from infancy, or at least as soon asthey&#xD;
are large enough to cling to a horse's mane.&#xD;
Your dog is too watchful, and really partakes&#xD;
of your own distrust. Call him away, Nicho-&#xD;
las, and I'll help Joe along."&#xD;

PATFIAWAY ; OR, TILE MOUNTAIN' OUTLAWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Queer boy ! condemned queer boy I" mut-&#xD;
tered Nick to himself.&#xD;
"Wabuma 1" exclaimed the Shoshone, lead-&#xD;
ing on again.&#xD;
Pathaway took the Indian youth by the arm,&#xD;
and with this friendly support he was able to&#xD;
proceed for half an hourlonger, when a sud-&#xD;
den turn in the valley brought them in sight&#xD;
of thexmimie city.&#xD;
"The Ingin knows what he's about," said&#xD;
Nicholas, in reply to an inquiring glance from&#xD;
Pathaway. "ie's doubledon our track and&#xD;
come back ag'in. The critters won't think o'&#xD;
loolin' for us so near home. A little ahead of&#xD;
us is the Devil's Gate, which is hid from view&#xD;
now by the objecks atween. The chief knows&#xD;
a hidin'-place for us up thereaways, I'll be&#xD;
bound."&#xD;
Multnomah struck to the left, and the par-&#xD;
ties were soon winding among towering rocks,&#xD;
beside which their figures looked like pigmies.&#xD;
Pathaway believed he now understood what&#xD;
the chief meant when he spoke of the birds&#xD;
building theirinests high up arnong the roks.&#xD;
'Twas a good idee," quoth Nick. "The&#xD;
Shoshone is wise. Bear up a few minutes lon-&#xD;
ger, little 'in, and we'll be at the end of our&#xD;
tramp. It's hard climbin', but we'll soon con-.&#xD;
quer it."     1&#xD;
Pausing occasionally for the parties to&#xD;
breathe, Multnomah ,ascended obliquely the&#xD;
mountain-side to a point half way to the sum-&#xD;
mit, and nearly opposite the Devil's Gate. At&#xD;
that spot the towers, walls, and columns of the&#xD;
mimic city were most conspicuous, rising like&#xD;
gigantic works of art fallen to ruins.&#xD;
" Doubledark, here we rest. A band of&#xD;
warriors might hide here. Our enemies are&#xD;
like dogs thrown from the scent of game by&#xD;
running water," said Multnomah.&#xD;
" All that's true enough, Ingin ; but we shall&#xD;
have to eat and drink the same as other folks&#xD;
in the course o' natur', and game can't be very&#xD;
abundant hereabout."&#xD;
" Doubledark is a hunter ; he knows the&#xD;
path of the mountain-sheep, and .the trail&#xD;
where 9e deermand the buffalo go down to the&#xD;
streams to drink, He is not a squaw to sit&#xD;
down and'starve. "&#xD;
" True, Shoshons! Doubledark, nor them&#xD;
that is with him will never starve while there's&#xD;
a hoof or a feather of game in the Nor'West."&#xD;
Pathaway examined with considerable curi-&#xD;
osity the retreat in which he now found him-&#xD;
self. He was particularly impressed with the&#xD;
vas monuments around him. He had seldom&#xD;
contemplated Nature in a wilder and grander&#xD;
mood. He had some difficulty in persuading&#xD;
himself that he-was not treading the ruins of&#xD;
an ancient city. But there were no marks of&#xD;
the chisel upon the broad surfaces of column&#xD;
and shaft; the walls were hewn by Nature-&#xD;
uptorn from the quarry beneath by a mighty&#xD;
strength.&#xD;
Multnomah had chosen for a place of con-&#xD;
&#xD;
cealment a rocky chamber at the base of one&#xD;
of the most imposing of the mimic castles.&#xD;
Nick and Portneuf covered the rough floor&#xD;
with a carpet of wild sage and such foliage as&#xD;
they could find' growing where there was suffi-&#xD;
cient soil for vegetation. The blankets of the&#xD;
parties were spread over this, furnishing a&#xD;
couch by no means to be despised by wearied&#xD;
and hunted fugitives. It is true that the iron&#xD;
frame of Nick had suffered little or no dimi-&#xD;
nution of strength ; but Sebastian and the In-&#xD;
dian youth were so'much exhausted, that evi-&#xD;
dently they could have proceeded no farther.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
SEX    AND   SEBASTIAN.&#xD;
Nick Whiffles attended carefully to the&#xD;
wounded arm, and when the -lad was as com-&#xD;
fortably placed as his meagre means would al-&#xD;
low, he seemed greatly relieved, and much of&#xD;
his anxiety vanished.&#xD;
" He needs sleep and rest arter his exer-&#xD;
tions," he remarked to Pathaway, as they is-&#xD;
sued together from the stony. portals of their&#xD;
hiding-place. "It's somethin' peculiar to the&#xD;
lad that he likes to be by hisself when any-&#xD;
thing ails him."  Then to Multnomah :&#xD;
"Chief, is there any water hereabouts ?&#xD;
The boy must be powerful thirsty by this&#xD;
time."&#xD;
The Shoshone made an affirmative move-&#xD;
Inent of the head, and went to procure the el-&#xD;
ement in question.&#xD;
em"There's subject upon which I wish to&#xD;
talk with you," said Pathaway, drawing Nick&#xD;
aside.   y&#xD;
"Well, colonel, I'm willin' tohear an man's&#xD;
talk when it's reasonable. Let's set down in&#xD;
the shade o' this wall, for I'pose it's a subjeck&#xD;
that can be spoke on settin' as well as stanmn'."&#xD;
"It is a, matter that I scarcely know how to&#xD;
approach," Pathaway added, with some em-&#xD;
barrassmenit.&#xD;
"Can't imaginee what 'tis, rejoined Nick,&#xD;
with a little start. "Never had no secrets in&#xD;
my life; and not in my life, neither, but none&#xD;

"You could not, ndeed; -and it was that&#xD;

tinct. The Tartars, for instance, was reduced&#xD;
to a hundred million -- which was melan-&#xD;
choly."&#xD;
Pathaway listened patiently for Nick to&#xD;
talk himself out of breath ; but the trapper&#xD;
exhibited no sign of weariness. Subject-mat-&#xD;
ter appeared to stretch before him as measure-&#xD;
less as the prairies he delighted in, and as va-&#xD;
ried as the Northwest. While he, was mak-,&#xD;
ing a longer pause than usual at a period,&#xD;
the hunter arose and quietly left him, to take&#xD;
a more careful survey of Trapper Valley and&#xD;
the region around..it.&#xD;
This conversation took place just outside&#xD;
the natural chamber where Sebastian was re-&#xD;
elining. Now it happened that there was a&#xD;
passage between' the rocks -that.transmitted&#xD;
sounds with great facility ; and thus'the youth&#xD;
accidentally became a party o all that passed.&#xD;
between the hunter and the trapper. He lis-&#xD;
tened with vavrying emotions, 'and sought the&#xD;
Shoshone at the close of the singular inter{&#xD;
view. He spoke earnestly with the chief for&#xD;
a few moments ; and shortly after, when Nick&#xD;
looked for Multnomah, he could not be'found.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
A Stf OICAL OPERATION.&#xD;
ileantime Indian Joe,'who appeared to be&#xD;
sleeping, had ears that were quite 'as acute -as&#xD;
those of the anomalous boy:Sebastian,' and&#xD;
heard every word of the conversation - that&#xD;
passed between Nicholas and the gray hunt-&#xD;
er. He kept his secret, however, till the dark-&#xD;
ness of night veiled the scenery of Mimic'&#xD;
City. Leaving his concealment, he walked; in&#xD;
the open air ; and seeing the trapper return-&#xD;
ing (who had been out in tett of garie, and&#xD;
approached with a mountain sheep -upon his&#xD;
shoulders) hastened to meethim. 2  1&#xD;
"Hullo ! is it-you, Little P'ison?  Got over:&#xD;
your bad feelin's, eh-? queried Nicholas.:&#xD;
"Joe sleep-feel better.' He somethin' to&#xD;
say it the great trapper," answered the boy.&#xD;
lick threw down his burden, and looked&#xD;
curiously at Joe. --&#xD;
"One04  ust allers have his eyes. open when&#xD;
an      flatters," he replied-,-"'specially.4.&#xD;
_.'   4ncer Ingin like you. But speak.out;.&#xD;
'our kind of insex say, ' My ears are: open,&#xD;
and Ill hear your talk of whatsomevrna.&#xD;
tur'.'.&#xD;
"Joe no bad Ingin ; he got heart';ie hear&#xD;
the pale:ace eryin' for his daughter; he'see&#xD;
tears renadown. - Joe know where she is: He&#xD;
lead Doubledark to her; Doubledark take her_&#xD;
away-bring her here."&#xD;
Whiffles- braced his long- rifle out, before&#xD;
him, leaned his tall;wiry form against it, and.&#xD;
looked down upon the youth with an expres-&#xD;
sion half credulous, hal doubting.&#xD;
"Put a punetooation there, and wait while&#xD;
&#xD;
I sharpen .my fakilties with a trifle o' the&#xD;
weed."&#xD;
The trapper drew a small package of to-&#xD;
bacco from the pouch at his side, and convey-&#xD;
ed it deliberately to his mouth, as if the more&#xD;
slowly he performed , the operation 'the less&#xD;
tardy would be his thoughts. Making a few&#xD;
lazy oscillations of his.jawsover the narcotic&#xD;
morsel, he said:&#xD;
" There's some dispelsitions that I know&#xD;
almost at a glance, and there's others that I&#xD;
don't ; 'mong the last I may safely reckon&#xD;
your'n ; for you're a bit o' human natur' that&#xD;
staggers me. Dunn' all my -travelin' over&#xD;
mountings and peraries, over rivers and lakes,&#xD;
I've never struck the trail of. a heathen so puz-&#xD;
zliu';in.his mentual and physikal makin' up.&#xD;
There's been no good will atween is,.as you&#xD;
know,' Little P'ison, and it.strikes me as bor-&#xD;
derin''on the ludickerous when you come to&#xD;
,me 'with sich a projeck. It does, by. light-&#xD;
nin' !&#xD;
Joe had waited patiently for the trapper to&#xD;
gather his thoughts and make these remarks,&#xD;
but did not raise his eyes to the face. of Nick,&#xD;
and more than. once pressed his white teeth&#xD;
upon his under lip, as if in an.effort to curb a&#xD;
strong feeling.&#xD;
" Joe thought Doubledark pitied the French&#xD;
.pale-face ; but he was wrong; he will speak&#xD;
of it no more, The great chief down in the&#xD;
Valley will take the young squaw for his wife."&#xD;
,Joe turned to go.&#xD;
"Don't be so techy, Little P'ison, for I&#xD;
ha'n't said .yes or no, yet. Want to take the&#xD;
bearin's o'.the case fust. The Whiffleses isn't&#xD;
gener'ly of a 'rash natur, though that disorder&#xD;
went through our family when we's young.&#xD;
Frn never in a hurry 'bout coming' t9 a pint&#xD;
when a thing is onsartin. Let's come at it,&#xD;
systeinatie, as 'twere. I understand' ye to say&#xD;
thatou 'can lead me to this' kali Jest turn&#xD;
the aaletrees o' your eyes on mine."&#xD;
The dark-brown orbs of. thi Indian youth&#xD;
rere firmly raised to Nick's. There might&#xD;
halve'been a nervous quiver in them, at first,&#xD;
but.it was of transient duration.&#xD;
"Can't read 'em, can't read 'em !" said&#xD;
Nicholas, shaking his'head. "They a'n't sick as&#xD;
I've come in contact with a great 'eal. They're&#xD;
both soft-and fiery, open and eunnini at the&#xD;
same time, timid and fierce. - Little P'ison,&#xD;
you're whatmy gran'father used to call a non-&#xD;
description."&#xD;
" Doubledark is afraid ! His heart grows&#xD;
smaller as 'he grows older. He- is' not like&#xD;
Seven   lumes, the great, chief of the Black-&#xD;
foob'.nation."&#xD;
"And God be praised fort l I don't keer to&#xD;

allers 'the Shoshons, who's more of a feller&#xD;
bein' nor some of lighter complexions."&#xD;
'" To the Shoshon Joe Will go."&#xD;
At that Moment Andrew Jeanjean was heard&#xD;
singing " The Trapper's Daughter." Nick's&#xD;

feelings were touched. He saw, too, at a little&#xD;
distance, Portneuf pacing to and fro with a&#xD;
melancholy air.&#xD;
"Young Ingin," he added, more seriously,&#xD;
" I ha'n't much faith in ye, as you understan',&#xD;
but compassion for the gal and for others,&#xD;
moves me. I a'n't a hard man, nor never was.&#xD;
Pity is no stranger to the breast of Nick Whif-&#xD;
fles; he's found a place at his mentual camp-&#xD;
fire more nor once, and will ag'in. I've risked&#xD;
somethin' for Beauty afore now. There was&#xD;
Baby Blanche, the 'dopted darter of Buck&#xD;
Bison ; and there was Sylveen Vander, the&#xD;
nat'ral darter of old Saul Vander, the Guide ;&#xD;
two as dainty bits of womanhood as you can&#xD;
find in -the world. For each of 'em I did my&#xD;
best. I had little gunshot diffikilties on their&#xD;
account, not to mention other diffikilties. But&#xD;
Lord bless ye, Ingin, I've got. used to''em ;&#xD;
shouldn't 'joy myself'thout 'em. I'll trust ye,&#xD;
boy, I'll trust ye ; and if you betray me to my&#xD;
inernies, you'll do a deed that you'll be sorry&#xD;
for when you start for the happy hunting-&#xD;
grounds. Nick Whiffles never injured you nor&#xD;
yourn ; and not yourn, neither; for he's been&#xD;
obleeged in self-preservation to bring down a&#xD;
redskin now and then, but 'thout malice or a&#xD;
forethought."&#xD;
Joe's face grew brighter ; his eyes sparkled&#xD;
with animation.&#xD;
"It seems to .please ye," said the trapper,&#xD;
musingly. " I hope it's all right, and there's&#xD;
no diviltry at the bottom. I've a quick eye&#xD;
and a quick hand, lad, and you won't die full-&#xD;
growed if your treachery becomes apperient&#xD;
afore you're ready."&#xD;
"Ugh !" articulated Joe, contemptuously.&#xD;
"Too much doubt makes a coward. When&#xD;
a great Ingin chief do a thing, lie no say great&#xD;
many words. Joe will be ready in an hour."&#xD;
" It'll be dark, then," said Nick, reflectively,&#xD;
casting his eyes toward the heavens. " We&#xD;
shallh need darkness, I allow. We'll go alone,&#xD;
Ingin. The colonel and the Frenchman may&#xD;
stay to look arter the wounded lad and Jean-&#xD;
jean. Poor Andrew ! I must patch up his&#xD;
head afore long. The brain's a tender pint,&#xD;
but I don't see why it can't be put in runnin'&#xD;
order well's a watch."&#xD;
Nick stopped and thought about it.&#xD;
" Doubledark will be silent. His tongue no&#xD;
talk 'bout goin'."'&#xD;
A wave of distrust rolled across the trapper's&#xD;
mind, but considering the object in view, he&#xD;
generously and unselfishly shook it off.&#xD;
Joe will find you behind the rocks, down&#xD;
there, when it's time to go."&#xD;
"I'll be there, boy," answered Nick, and&#xD;
taking up his burden, hastened to join those&#xD;
who were expecting his return. Selecting the&#xD;
daintiest portions of the sheep, he cooked them&#xD;
with the skill and care of one thoroughly versed&#xD;
in such matters, and'carried them to Sebas-&#xD;
tian.                             i&#xD;
"Over to the left, not fur from here, in a di-&#xD;
&#xD;
rect line, you'll find water clear' as crystal,&#xD;
gushing from the rock," said Nick.&#xD;
" You're going' away, Nick; I know by your&#xD;
,looks," the youth answered, quickly.&#xD;
"Portneuf is grievin' for his darter."&#xD;
"His sorrow has touched your generous&#xD;
heart, uncle Nick."&#xD;
" Why shouldn't it, child ? If you's shut&#xD;
up down gender, in the valley, at the marcy of&#xD;
lawless men, do you think I could rest ?" re-&#xD;
turned the trapper, earnestly.&#xD;
"You could not; you would brave every-&#xD;
thing for my sake."&#xD;
"True, child,, true ! And why shouldn't I&#xD;
do the same for another? She's less, much&#xD;
less to me nor you be, yet it can't be denied&#xD;
that she has a claim on my exertions. Hu-&#xD;
manity is humanity, whether in the wilderness&#xD;
or other places. the colonel is here, and if I&#xD;
shouldn't come back; I couldn't leave ye in&#xD;
hands tenderer or carefuller."&#xD;
"-Don't talk in that strain, my friend, for&#xD;
such a possibility is painful. Who goes with&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
" The young Ingin--Little P'ison, I call him.&#xD;
He proposed it, and I concluded to trust him."&#xD;
Sebastian pmused, then looking anxiously at&#xD;
Nick, replied :&#xD;
"I have misgivings, my friend ; I doubt&#xD;
Indian Joe. He is, in truth, a strange com-&#xD;
pound of sullenness, timidity, and fire. Some-&#xD;
times he looks at me with an expression'angry&#xD;
and forbidding."&#xD;
"I've noticed it; but it comes of the crook-&#xD;
edness of Ingin natur'. He can't helpwhat's in&#xD;
him, I s'pect, 'cause it's in his blood ; and&#xD;
what's in one's blood, can't very yell be got&#xD;
out. No two of us are alike. One takes to&#xD;
the bush, another to the city ; one likes his&#xD;
kind, another hates it. One takes on airs and&#xD;
haughty ways, while another wears his man-&#xD;
ners as he does a suit of old clothes-with ease,.&#xD;
and without stiffness. I know he's a queer&#xD;
redskin, this Ingin Joe Abut if thei'e's any truth&#xD;
in him, I'll give it a chance to show itself."&#xD;
"Let me warn you not to put too much&#xD;
faith in him. You have treated him with&#xD;
some severity, and-I am sure that he can have&#xD;
but little real friendship, for you, and but&#xD;
slight sympathy with your present purpose.&#xD;
If you must undertake this perilous enterprise,&#xD;
I entreat you to be guarded, and watchful of'&#xD;
the boy."      I&#xD;
"Sartin! The Ingins call me Doubledark,"&#xD;
said Nicholas, with some pride.&#xD;
"Your skill I do not doubt but who can&#xD;
guard against treachery ?" said the youth.,&#xD;
" Jes' so! Treachery has to do with the&#xD;
heart and the motives, and we can't allern tel&#xD;
what them be. Hovsomnever, we'll hope for'&#xD;
the best. Here comes the colonel! Colonel,&#xD;
I'm going ' to perform that operation now on&#xD;

"The operation is so delicate, that rdil1,&#xD;

Yes, colonel, I allow it looks ventur'some ;&#xD;
but with steady narves I feel that I can man-&#xD;
Age it. I won't hurt him.- If I can on'yraise&#xD;
up them tvoplates o' the skull'"- the skull&#xD;

Conie here, you Andrew Jeanjean, and I'll try&#xD;

Jeanjean followed the trapper and Pathaway,&#xD;
and, in.obedience to the command of the for-&#xD;
muer, seated himself behind a column.6f rock.&#xD;
Nick lighted a large splinter of the pitch-pine&#xD;
which he had procured for the purpose, and&#xD;
handed it to Pathaway, who was beginning to&#xD;
feel uneasy-&#xD;
f Nick produced a pocket-knife, nd exam-&#xD;
ined its edge.&#xD;
"It's pooty sharp, I allow," he said, with a&#xD;
satisfied ai; "and if wasn't', wouldn'tt make&#xD;
nogreat difference, for there isn't much cut-&#xD;
tin' to do, and if there was, 'twouldn't hurt&#xD;

honest clodhoppers, and cut across niuskles ii&#xD;
opening- abscesses, or destractin' bullets or&#xD;
splinters lodge in the flesh ; than which coin-&#xD;

Jeaujean's head, and holding the pocket-knife&#xD;
aloft in the other, " it has come under my oh-&#xD;
sarvatioi durin' sieh times as I've stopped in&#xD;

lihe; for there's some sense in thumpin' on an&#xD;
anvil, but not an artom in hammerin' away at&#xD;
a Wible with a fist as big as a sledge-hammer."&#xD;
Nicholas approached his. instrument within&#xD;
six inches of Andrewv's passive 'head, when it&#xD;
became fied, and'the last idea appeared to ab-&#xD;
sorb him quite.    -&#xD;
"When I've seen eich fists coming down&#xD;

myself that, the same, force- might 'a'. driven&#xD;
-a spade into the sile, ondmade it ready for a&#xD;
pertater -;or a grain o' corn to grow. It's a&#xD;
q user queer world -&#xD;
Nicholas stopped, then sai':&#xD;
"Hold still, Jeanjeau I If you stir so much&#xD;
&#xD;
as the thickness of a hair, you sba'n't sing the&#xD;
'Trapper's Darter' no more. Remember,&#xD;
Nanny, don't ye, Andrew u"&#xD;
" Ml jolie Ninons " muttered Jeanjean.&#xD;
" Jes' so !" quoth Nicholas, carefully ,separ-&#xD;
ating 'the half-granulated lips of the wound,&#xD;
and examining it with scrupulous  nicety.&#xD;
"The fact is, Andrew, they've jest about-nade&#xD;
an idiot of ye, which is nigh the muchness of&#xD;

vally in this world. You'd better go under,&#xD;
and done with it, than be a fool. You can t&#xD;
have Nanny, if you're a fool. So don't wince !"&#xD;
The unfortunate Jeanjean turned his eves&#xD;
upon Nick with singular earnestness. The.&#xD;
light of the torch glowed. upon his face, inm-&#xD;
parting to itS gravity and fixedness a strahige&#xD;
intensity.&#xD;

suffered.     -&#xD;
" Youxma-i-groan,Andrew : but if you stir,&#xD;
good-bye to-unny !"-&#xD;
Nick wotited quietly, taking out two or&#xD;
three splintbis of-one, pausing once, only to&#xD;
say : " Whatever comes o' this, colonel, say nio-&#xD;

"'Twill do no harm," he muttered. "Knowed&#xD;

MADE.&#xD;
Pathaway disposed of Jeanjean in. the ma&#xD;

he had fallen into abheavy sleep. lie the&#xD;
looked for Sebastian, but could not find Lin&#xD;
Alarmed by his disappearance, he question&#xD;
Portneuf, from whom he derived no inform&#xD;
tion. le commenced a diligent search among&#xD;
the ruins, but without success. .Believing:&#xD;
possible that he had followed Nick, he d&#xD;
scented toward Trapper Valley. so far as h&#xD;
thought compatible with safety; not his ow&#xD;
but that of the party He retraced his step&#xD;
much perplexed, and was discussing the sub&#xD;
Ject with Portneuf, when the Shoshons ap&#xD;
feared. The chief was not alone ; a young&#xD;
Indian girl walked beside him, whose advane&#xD;
Patlaway beheld with increasing curiosity&#xD;
She was clad after the manner of her people&#xD;
but her garments were of stuffs richer anc&#xD;
finer than are usually obtained by the natives&#xD;
She drew near slowly, and with averted eyes.&#xD;
"Where is Sebastian ?" asked Pathaway&#xD;
turning from a brief scrutiny of this new.an(&#xD;
interesting addition to the party, to the Sho&#xD;
shone.&#xD;
Ask me where is last night's dew or yes-&#xD;
terday's rain," answered Multnomah.&#xD;
Pathaway stirred the brands of the not yet&#xD;
extinguished fire, causing them to emit a fitful&#xD;
flame, which threw a glare upon the girl's face.&#xD;
The features were classically reular, and, de-&#xD;
spite their tawhy tinge, han some; and not&#xD;
only beautiful, but familiar.&#xD;
"Sebastian !" exclaimed the young man.&#xD;
"But Sebastian no more," answered the&#xD;
girl, blushing. "I trust, sir-I hope that you&#xD;
will not misconstrue-" she stammered.&#xD;
"No apologies, I beg I I will misconstrue&#xD;
nothing.  Your conduct shall be leniently&#xD;
judged by me," replied Pathaway, not without&#xD;
embarrassment.&#xD;
The chief walked away, and left them to-&#xD;
gether.&#xD;
"Come nearer the light," added Pathaway.&#xD;
The girl obeyed, with a smile and a blush.&#xD;
Is this indeed Indian blood that colors&#xD;
your hands and your cheeks ?" he asked, ner-&#xD;
vously taking one of her hands.&#xD;
"Madge, the half-breed girl, is of the same&#xD;
parentage as the boy Sebastian. What else&#xD;
could you expect, sir?"'&#xD;
"God only knows !" exclaimed Pathaway,&#xD;
dropping her hand, with a disappointment so&#xD;
evident that it could not be concealed.&#xD;
I think Nicholas informed you that my&#xD;
mother wasa French woman, and my father&#xD;
of, mixed blood ?"'&#xD;
"Confound, the mixed blood !" muttered.&#xD;
Pathaway.&#xD;
.Itappears to be very much, confounded,"&#xD;
sai"dLMadge,overhearing the remark.&#xD;
Let me assure you," said Pathaway, "that&#xD;
I'FE&#xD;
1  .&#xD;
&#xD;
I have not been so blind as you may have 1m.&#xD;
agined, in regard to your sex."&#xD;
"N Nor Insoeblind in regard to your suspi.&#xD;
,n- cions. I noted] their commencement, and have&#xD;
ill watched their development from time to time.&#xD;
en You know not what I have suffered ; such&#xD;
ii. shame, such epibarrassment,sueh humiliation !&#xD;
d I return to the proper garb of my sex with in.&#xD;
a- describable relief."&#xD;
Ig   " Has not my deportment been considerate&#xD;
it and gentle ? 'EIave I not, at .least of late&#xD;
e- treated you-with markedJ respect ?" interro-&#xD;
e gated Pathaway, with-a slight tinge of remorse.&#xD;
n, "I do-not complain. If at first a smile of&#xD;
s, contempt appeared upon your lips, it after.&#xD;
- ward gave place to compassion. But we had&#xD;
best not recall those matters to-night."&#xD;
g    "I have curiosity as well as woman," said&#xD;
e Pathaway, pleasantly ; "I am anxious to hear&#xD;
. your history."&#xD;
;'He looked earnestly at the beautiful face of&#xD;
d  Madge.&#xD;
. " Histories," she replied, " do not read well&#xD;
till we are dead. Nick Whiffles is my histo-&#xD;
r, ian. Honest Nick! I fear he will be be-&#xD;
d trayed by that Indian boy. Tell me, Mr.&#xD;
- Pathway, do you think we are safe ? Will&#xD;
not the mountain outlaws and their savage&#xD;
allies discover our hiding-place ? Ought this&#xD;
fire to blaze here 2"&#xD;
I " We are so shut up by rocky columns and-&#xD;
l walls, that I apprehend little danger of discov--&#xD;
ery," replied Pathaway, reflectively. " And&#xD;
yet," he resumed, " I cannot conceal from you&#xD;
that our enemies are cunning, nor deny the&#xD;
fact that the pursuit will be long and skillful-&#xD;
ly conducted. But since you are with us,&#xD;
your sex will and shall stimulate us to the&#xD;
greatest efforts for your protection. I will&#xD;
not, I cannot forget that wound which you&#xD;
bear for me. Believe me, my gratitude is&#xD;
genuine and deep. You have suffered, and&#xD;
suffered patiently ; you have borne the pain&#xD;
of your wound and the hardships of our flight&#xD;
without murmuring. Your heroism and fortis&#xD;
tude call forth my warmest admiration. -Ien-&#xD;
treat of you'to give me a place among those&#xD;
you call friends. Honor me with but-half the&#xD;
confidence you bestow upon Nicholas, the&#xD;
trapper,- and I shall indeed esteem:myself&#xD;
happy !"-&#xD;
Pathaway spoke with fervor; a glow of en-&#xD;
thusiasm suffused his face. The girl Madge&#xD;
changed color, manifesting that soft confusion&#xD;
that woman feels when secretly pleased; but&#xD;
whom pride-and maidenly reserve admonish&#xD;
to conceal th$ 'emotion.&#xD;
" FriendsI 'rust we shall ever be," she an-&#xD;
swered; 'obut Nieholas--ah, I -have known -&#xD;
Nicholas a long wti  1"&#xD;
It would have been difficult to explain why,&#xD;
but this, remark -"gave the- gray hunter pain.&#xD;
He envied Nick tile confidence of the singular-&#xD;
being beside hiin.:. He felt annoyed that -he&#xD;
could not fill-the i'ace place in her thoughts,&#xD;

and have the same right to care for and pro-&#xD;
tect her. While these emotions were upon&#xD;
hiin, the Shoshone hastily came up, extin-&#xD;
guished the'fire and scattered the brands.&#xD;
" Is there danger?" asked Pathaway, quick-&#xD;
"Danger," responded the chief, "is never&#xD;
distant. The pale-faces and the red walk&#xD;
much to-night. The ear of the Shoshone has&#xD;
been to the ground, and heard the sound of&#xD;
feet far up the side of the mountain."  1&#xD;
"Are your ears, then, so acute ? I have&#xD;
heard nothing."&#xD;
" The hunter has heard too much," returned&#xD;
Multnomah, looking at Madge.   "He has&#xD;
heard the notes of the singing-bird, and he&#xD;
loves to listen."&#xD;
" What is it, Shoshon-? Which way lies the&#xD;
danger ?"&#xD;
"-It is there," said the chief, pointing to the&#xD;
north-west. " The white trappers are going&#xD;
down to the valley, perhaps, and will cross&#xD;
our trail on the way."&#xD;
" It will be fortunate for us if Seven-Plumes&#xD;
is not' with them, for his eyes are quick to find&#xD;
a trail."&#xD;
Multnomah made a gesture for Madge to&#xD;
screen herself behind a column, which she did,&#xD;
and the chief moved off and was soon out of&#xD;
sig it, Pathaway was in the act of turning to&#xD;
address her, when a slight noise, like that pro-&#xD;
duced by cocking a pistol, esused him to&#xD;
pause and look suspiciously into the darkness.&#xD;
A sharp report quickly followed. Pathaway&#xD;
stag ered, but did not fall.&#xD;
"You are uninjured. - Thank God !" ex-&#xD;
claimed Madge.&#xD;
"Yes," replied the hunter, "I believe I am&#xD;
unhurt."&#xD;
He pointed to a perforation in his frock.:,&#xD;
" It passed through your garments ; but,"&#xD;
she-.added,,turning pale with alarm, " where&#xD;
is the bullet? I did not hear it strike the&#xD;
rock behind you I"&#xD;
-athaway unbuttoned his frock, and with a&#xD;
smile, drew from beneath it a package. He-&#xD;
held up before her a mass of dark hair, from&#xD;
which a bullet dropped.&#xD;
"Curls have often proved fatal," he said,.&#xD;
"to ,men's hearts ; but these, as you see, have&#xD;
saved mine.'&#xD;
For a moment, Madge was too much agitat-&#xD;
ed to speak; she contemplated the raven&#xD;
tresses with clasped hands and parted lips.&#xD;
" Tell me,k' she cried, when she could com-&#xD;
mand her voice-then suddenly checked her-&#xD;
self, and stood silently gazing at Pathaway.&#xD;
"4Be calm; that danger,.at least, is passed.&#xD;
I can say that I have been saved by a woman's&#xD;
tresses."&#xD;
"You are not sheltered; another shot may&#xD;
prove more.hurtful. Step behind a column ;&#xD;
it will shield you from the unseen marksman,"&#xD;
she saki,.with-beseeehing look.&#xD;
"fA2t. oniy saved by a woman's curls, but&#xD;
&#xD;
by a woman's arms," added the hunter,&#xD;
thoughtfully ; " and that arm," he continued,&#xD;
" yours. But I lose time in idle talk when I&#xD;
should be looking for the foe. Hasten to our&#xD;
covert, Madge, in the mimic castle, and I'll&#xD;
soon bring you word how matters stand."&#xD;
Pathaway glanced toward the suspicious&#xD;
quarter with hawk-like intensity-then, stoop-&#xD;
ing and grasping his rifle firmly, stole noise-&#xD;
lessly from the spot.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXI.&#xD;
THE RESTORATION-THE MIDNIGHT STRIFE.&#xD;
Madge entered the rocky. cavern, for in&#xD;
truth it was little else.  The moonlight&#xD;
crept dimly in through the gaping crevices.&#xD;
Andrew Jeanjean was sleeping. She stood be-&#xD;
side him, listening anxiously to every sound&#xD;
without. His features, imperfectly revealed by&#xD;
the faint nocturnal beams, were paler than&#xD;
they were wont; but she noticed that they&#xD;
changed occasionally, responsive, doubtless, to&#xD;
his varying dreams.    Every moment was&#xD;
fraught with suspense, and the time to' Madge&#xD;
was dismally long.&#xD;
She missed Nick, whose voice had become&#xD;
so faniiliar, and was ever so full of friendliness.&#xD;
During the last few hours there had been as&#xD;
great a change in her feelings as in her garb.&#xD;
She was no longer Sebastian Delaunay, obliged&#xD;
to act an unnatural character, and one entirely&#xD;
opposed to her innate delicacy. There had&#xD;
been a constant struggle in her bosom, which&#xD;
increased in a tenfold degree after meeting the&#xD;
gray hunter. - To Nick she had grown accus-&#xD;
tomed ; for he, being in her secret, the need of&#xD;
constant effort and watchfulness was less ur-&#xD;
gent. . It was after her acquaintance with&#xD;
Pathaway had begun, that the embarrassment&#xD;
of her false position became really painful.&#xD;
Every moment she had feared discovery, and&#xD;
many times was in doubt whether he had not&#xD;
already divined the secret of her sex. All&#xD;
this was past-except the maidenly shame of&#xD;
its recollection. She had returned to the garb&#xD;
worn by her sex, and though differing from&#xD;
that of her civilized sisters, it was well adapted&#xD;
'to life in the wilderness.&#xD;
It was an inexpressible relief not to feel&#xD;
compelled to simulate masculine manners.&#xD;
Had danger been more distant, her feelings of&#xD;
relief would have been more marked and conm-&#xD;
plete ; but anxiety for her friends and defend-&#xD;
ers marred the pleasure of the metamorphosis.&#xD;
She expected to hear every instant the stealthy&#xD;
tread of Indians, or those whose presence she&#xD;
dreaded as much.&#xD;
A sing lrifle-shot rang through the rocks.&#xD;
Andrew J anjean started up, yawned. opened&#xD;
his drowsy eyes, stared at Madge, then glanced&#xD;
wonderingly around him. The young woman&#xD;
.observed him in silence, awaiting with interest&#xD;
the result of Nick's surgery.&#xD;
" Who are you ?" he asked, slowly. "Where'&#xD;
-where am    I?  Ah 1 I must have fallen&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
l&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
Igg&#xD;
&#xD;
asleep on the way! I have had a long walk&#xD;
but I don't remember lying down. Where are&#xD;
my peltries, I wonder ?"&#xD;
W hat is the last thing you remember ?"&#xD;
Made asked.&#xD;
With a bewildered air, Andrew arose, and&#xD;
looked at the interrogator, who repeated her&#xD;
question.&#xD;
"The last thing I remember?" reiterated&#xD;
Jeanjean, reflectively. "I recollect starting&#xD;
from the trapping-grounds, and having my&#xD;
~horse stolen as I camped at night. Let me&#xD;
see--then I threw my peltries across my shoul-&#xD;
ders, and, camie as far as here; that is, I&#xD;
reached a gulch or canon, which must be in&#xD;
this vicinity. Then-then"-Andrew put his&#xD;
hand to his brow-" then-everything seems&#xD;
to leave off abruptly. I have had darkness&#xD;
and confused dreams."&#xD;
"Have you no consciousness ofa shock, a&#xD;
sudden pain, the report of a gun, a fall ?"&#xD;
asked Madge.&#xD;
" All is blank !" replied Andrew, hopelessly.&#xD;
"To be brief, you were behet by ruffians,&#xD;
robbed, and left for dead, and owe your pre-&#xD;
servation to a brave man who witnessed the&#xD;
outrage."&#xD;
"How long ago was that ?" inquired Jean-&#xD;
jean.&#xD;
" More than a week," answered Madge.&#xD;
" It seems scarcely possible," said Jeanjean.&#xD;
" Your wound was of the head," continued&#xD;
Madge. " But this is no time for details. We&#xD;
are in danger - pursued by enemies upon&#xD;
whose ears the cries of mercy are lost."&#xD;
. I cannot realize this !" exclaimed Andrew,&#xD;
,with emphasis. "How can one lose a week_&#xD;
of life, yet awake to the conscious world strong,&#xD;
and to all appearance healthy "&#xD;
Jeanjean passed his hand dubiously over his&#xD;
head, wincing when he touched the wound.&#xD;
"All this is possible,".he added,-" though&#xD;
to me most dreamlike and improbable. I have&#xD;
had a concussion of the brain-a fracture of&#xD;
the skull, or an injury of that ,nature, doubt-&#xD;
less.&#xD;
The French voyageur joined them.&#xD;
" Where is Pathaway ? Where is the Sho-&#xD;
shone ?" he asked, hastily. "We will be be-&#xD;
set by enemies, and we ,s'all be killed if we&#xD;
don't fight ver' much."&#xD;
Andrew heard the sound of his voice, and&#xD;
remembered the father of Ninon.       .&#xD;
"Portneuf I" he cried, seizing his hand.&#xD;
" What is this I s'all hear ? His senses is&#xD;
come back. This is astonish! This onegrand&#xD;
surprise -"&#xD;
" I am very faint-I am dizzy ! In a mo-&#xD;
ment I shall be calm. There--there-I am&#xD;
quite restored. Tell me of Ninon ?"&#xD;
He looked earnestly at the voyageur.&#xD;
"Ma jolie Ninon 2" exclaimed.Portneuf, sor-&#xD;
rowfully.&#xD;
" What has happened to Ninon ?"&#xD;
"Be discreet'!" whispered Madge.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Mon Dieu! , I will not tell yOU what s'all&#xD;
aIppen to her. They take her away-the&#xD;
what you calls him--robbers."&#xD;
" Robbers ? Ninon ?" said Andrew,'with a&#xD;
start.&#xD;
"You are imprudent! I fear the shock of&#xD;
this-announcement will prove too much for his&#xD;
newly-restored reason," said Madge,, in a low&#xD;
voice, to the voyageur.&#xD;
" My heart so full, so ver' full !" answered&#xD;
Portneuf, wringing his hands.&#xD;
"We have reason to sutppose," added Madge,&#xD;
" that Ninon is at Trapper Valley, whither she&#xD;
has been carried by some lawless free trappere.&#xD;
" The mountain outlaws.I" exclaimed'Jean-&#xD;
jean, with strong emotion. " You tell ne,&#xD;
girl," he continued, fixing his eyes upon&#xD;
Madge, "that Ninon is in the bands of rob-&#xD;
bers and assassins, and expect me to hear yo;&#xD;
with calmness. Where are nay arms? let&#xD;
me fly to her rescu.!"&#xD;
" Listen, Jeanjean ! We are at this moment&#xD;
exposed to deadly peril. Pathaway and, the-&#xD;
Shoshone are seeking our, foes alone, and in&#xD;
the darkness ; while the old trapper, sick&#xD;
Whiffles, whose name-you may have heard, is&#xD;
making a hazardous attempt to save Ninon,"&#xD;
said Madge, hurriedly.&#xD;
-" Then my duty is heret" responded Andrew,&#xD;
restraining his feelings. "give me a weapon,&#xD;
Portneuf."&#xD;
"Nicholas has kept your armse carefully;&#xD;
they lie there by the rocks," said Madge.&#xD;
"I trust my wound has not deprived ne of&#xD;
strength and cunning," responded Andrew-&#xD;
and seizing his weapons,'and admonishing the&#xD;
girl to remain, rushed forth with the voya-&#xD;
geur. Madge felt it impossible to stay there&#xD;
quietly. Taking the bow and quiver of ar-&#xD;
rows which had been her com'panions for&#xD;
many months, she left her covert, and soon&#xD;
stood on the spot where she had parted from&#xD;
the gray hunter. No one was in sight. Mi sio&#xD;
City stretched out around her, toward revery&#xD;
point of compass, like a scene of enchant.&#xD;
meant. It was a grim and frowning solitude&#xD;
that might be broken at any moment by the&#xD;
gliding footsteps or piercing yells of savage&#xD;
foemen. Shaft, column, and wall might'eon.&#xD;
ceal miscreants, from whom she shrankwith&#xD;
indescribable dread. She glanced timidly this&#xD;
way and that, then advanced with'noiseless&#xD;
steps toward the point where Pathaway had&#xD;
disappeared. She heard sounds toward the&#xD;
Valley, which grew more distinct as she pro-&#xD;
ceeded. Springing upon a tottering wall, she&#xD;
gazed down the. mountain-side and saw, by.&#xD;
the aid of the 'moonlights two :persons strug.&#xD;
gling together on a platform of rock hanging&#xD;
over a precipice of a 'hundred 'feet. IZl-il-&#xD;
stinets assured hed that one was Pati way.&#xD;
She sprang toward the combatants like a a-&#xD;
mois, not stopping to'ask what assistance&#xD;
should render or what danger i ein'red.&#xD;
She was soon near enough to ?ereeive tt&#xD;

put out one small hand as if to thrust back&#xD;

without dishonor," answered Madge, with dig-&#xD;
nity. "If you indeed consider me so much&#xD;
your enemy, so fatally in your way, that knife&#xD;
in your .belt thrust into my bosom, which I&#xD;
here offer, will remove me from your path, and&#xD;
secure that silence which is eternal."-&#xD;
Madge parted the fold of her dress, and pre-&#xD;
sented a bosom spotlessly white.&#xD;
Carl6ta did not touch the weapon at her side,&#xD;
but partly drew a small dagger from her breast,&#xD;
upon the silver handle of which her fingers&#xD;
trembled convulsively. Her color changed&#xD;
rapidly, alternating from crimson to white.&#xD;
There was a painful conflict within.&#xD;
" Let no false emotion of pity prevent you&#xD;
&#xD;
105&#xD;
&#xD;
from striking," said Madge, earnestly., "If&#xD;
you knew the horror I have of yonder Valley&#xD;
and tle ibiscreants that infest it, I am sure&#xD;
you would .mercifully put an end to my sus-&#xD;
pense."&#xD;
Carl6ta slowly replaced the dagger, pressed&#xD;
her hands upon her heart and her face, then&#xD;
leaned against a rock, trembling in every limb.&#xD;
While both stood mute and agitated 'with va-&#xD;
rying emotions, Dick Iendricks appeared in&#xD;
the mountain-path to fill up the picture.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
THE EsCAPE-THE CAvERN.&#xD;
The dogs had disappeared about an hour&#xD;
after the departure of Nick, nor had Madge&#xD;
seen them  since. She now thought of tie&#xD;
faithful creatures, and wished they were near&#xD;
to save her. She looked furtively around in&#xD;
the hope of seeing them, and would have called&#xD;
them, had she been able to control her voice,&#xD;
Hendricks stared a moment at her, and Car-&#xD;
16ta then sat down upon a stone like.one ex-&#xD;
hausted. Carl6ta perceived that blood was&#xD;
flowing from the sleeve of his hunting-shirt,.&#xD;
and hastened to his side.&#xD;
" You are hurt !" sh9 exclaimed.&#xD;
" Not much, but faint from loss of blood,"&#xD;
replied Hendricks.&#xD;
Carldta began to search for the wound; and&#xD;
while she was bending over him, Madge con-&#xD;
ceived the idea of escape. The thought no&#xD;
sooner crossed her mind than she put it in&#xD;
practice. As Hendricks and Carlota were&#xD;
above her, cutting off her return,.she sprang&#xD;
down a little path toward the Valley -with ex-.&#xD;
traordinary swiftness. She did ,not turn to see&#xD;
if she were pursued, but flew onward with feet&#xD;
that scarcely touched the ground. Several,&#xD;
times she thought she heard the.voice/of Car-&#xD;
ldta and the sound of pursuit; but this incited.&#xD;
her to greater exertion. In the perturbation&#xD;
of flight, she did not remember that she was.&#xD;
descending to Trapper Valley, nor did- that&#xD;
truth force itself upon her till she saw the dis-&#xD;
mal portals of  Devil's Gate. The unwelcome&#xD;
sight caused her to pause. The dark mouth of&#xD;
the tunnel, the towering columns of basalt, the&#xD;
jagged rocks, the weird effect of the darkness&#xD;
upon all, conspired to fill her with terror.&#xD;
But it. was no time for hesitation or delay.&#xD;
She began to reason and think connectedly.&#xD;
Shuddering, she hurried past the gloomy en-&#xD;
trance to the Valley, and commenced the as-&#xD;
cent on the opposite side, which was far less&#xD;
steep and more accessible. The hope of es-&#xD;
cape was now really strong in the breast of&#xD;
Madge. In the outset, the effort was but n&#xD;
wild experiment, with scarcely probabilities&#xD;
enoughto give it the prestige of success. She&#xD;
beheld the space rapidly widening between her&#xD;
and the Valley with feelings of expectation&#xD;
that cannot well be imagined. - Her frame was&#xD;
too delicate, however, to endure long this vio-&#xD;
lent exercise. By the time she reached the&#xD;
&#xD;

100        PATHAWAY ; OR, THE MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS&#xD;
&#xD;
summit of the ascent, her speed was much&#xD;
abated, and her panting respiration and trem-&#xD;
bling limbs warned her that her physical pow-&#xD;
ers had been severely taxed, and called imper-&#xD;
atively for rest. She sank upon a grassy knoll,&#xD;
and listening for the sound of pursuing feet,&#xD;
heard the tumultuous beatings of her own&#xD;
heart. Again and again she held her breath,&#xD;
and turned her ear to the Valley, to be as often&#xD;
startled by imaginary alarms and chance in-&#xD;
terruptions of the prevailing silence.&#xD;
She dared not remain long inactive ; but&#xD;
taking, as near as she could judge, th-e direc-&#xD;
tion of Nick's hut, went forward with more&#xD;
calmness, though with less speed. She thought&#xD;
not of-wild beasts, or of the loneliness, and sol-&#xD;
itude, and darkness, but of Carl6ta, Hendricks,&#xD;
and the dreaded Valley. 'Tis true that she&#xD;
had fears for Nick, and regretted that she had&#xD;
not had sufficient presence of mind to ask&#xD;
Carldta concerning him. That she had be-&#xD;
trayed him, she had no doubt. This reflec-&#xD;
tion was fraught with pain, which even her&#xD;
own forlorn condition could not banish nor&#xD;
swallow- up in its greater misery. She saw&#xD;
landmarks that were familiar, and a little before&#xD;
morning reached Niek's deserted camp. She&#xD;
tottered in, and completely exhausted, was&#xD;
glad to cast herself upon its couch of ever-&#xD;
greens.&#xD;
The sun had performed part of his diurnal&#xD;
journey when she awoke. How familiar the&#xD;
spot looked ! How many memories it re-&#xD;
called-some pleasant, others quite the re-&#xD;
verse ! Here she had been the boy.Sebastian&#xD;
Delaunay, acting a partrepugnant to her na-&#xD;
ture. She recalled numberless trifling inci-&#xD;
dents of her short sojourn at the camp. It&#xD;
was near it that she had received the wound&#xD;
aimed- at Pathaway, and which, in the excite-&#xD;
ment of the last few hours, had been entirely&#xD;
forgotten by her ; but the arm, now swollen&#xD;
and inflamed by violent exercise, reminded&#xD;
her of the injury.&#xD;
What was she now to do?    Could she be&#xD;
long safe there ?  Would not Carl6ta's ven-&#xD;
geance pursue her-? If she fled, which way&#xD;
should she fly ? These and a thousand other&#xD;
queries pressed upon her at once. Deter-&#xD;
mined to act like. a reasonable being, and to&#xD;
employ every rational means of preservation,&#xD;
she refreshed herself with food that had'been&#xD;
left there at the time of 'their flight. Having&#xD;
thus, as in duty bound, attended to the wants&#xD;
of nature, she resolved to seek a more secure&#xD;
retreat, and trust her final rescue to her&#xD;
friends and Providence. She recollected that&#xD;
in one of her rambles she had discovered a&#xD;
small cave, the entrance to which was nearly-&#xD;
concealed by bushes, and immediately went to&#xD;
search for it. Having found it, she conveyed&#xD;
to it such useful articles as had been left at"&#xD;
the camp-among which were her own scarlet&#xD;
blanket, a hatchet, a carbine, ammunition, and&#xD;
several other articles,.all of which had been&#xD;
&#xD;
hidden under some boughs. The food, con-&#xD;
sisting of dried buffalo tongues and slices of&#xD;
the meat prepared in a similai- manner, she&#xD;
also carefully conveyed to her hiding-place.&#xD;
The cave was situated in a wood, within&#xD;
sight of the camp-so that, standing in its&#xD;
entrance, screened by its curtain of shrubbery,&#xD;
she could see any one who should approach&#xD;
it. At first, the darkness within was almost&#xD;
intolerable, but her eyes soon became accus-&#xD;
tomed to it ; and by removing asmuch of the&#xD;
foliage as seemed superfluous,}she let in not&#xD;
only additional light, but purer-air. Having&#xD;
thus provided for her safety according to the&#xD;
dictates of judgment and the limited means&#xD;
circumstances allowed her, she felt that she&#xD;
could do no more, and awaited anxiously the&#xD;
developmentsof time.&#xD;
The -sun had passed the meridian by the&#xD;
time these simple preparations were com-&#xD;
pleted. She was felicitating herself upon her&#xD;
escape, when she saw some one advancing&#xD;
toward the camp, and thought at first it&#xD;
might be Nick or Pathaway ; but it proved&#xD;
to be Bill Brace. He neared the camp in a&#xD;
stealthy manner, looked in, seemed disap-&#xD;
pointed, then searched for a trail. Several&#xD;
times he came very -near the spot where&#xD;
Madge was concealed, but finally went away,&#xD;
to her great relief. The remainder of the&#xD;
day and the ensuing night passed without&#xD;
further incident. Early in the morning, how-&#xD;
ever, Bill Brace and Carl6ta--the latter still&#xD;
dressed as Indian Joe--appeared.     -&#xD;
Madge began to tremble - for Bill Brace&#xD;
was leading'~the dog Smuggler by a string.&#xD;
There was now real cause for alarm. They&#xD;
would unleash the dog ; impelled by affection,&#xD;
he would take her trail, and come to her di-&#xD;
rectly. There could be no doubt-the catas-&#xD;
trophe was sure and at hand.  Madge was&#xD;
filled with nervous horror.  Of what avail&#xD;
was her escape from Carl6ta ! It was- only&#xD;
postponing her fate-not averting it. She&#xD;
gazed with palpitating heart from her covert.&#xD;
She saw Carl6ta go into the camp, come out&#xD;
again, glance searchingly from point to point,&#xD;
taking in the surrounding scenery with a&#xD;
sweeping look of her quick eyes.&#xD;
She made a .motion to Brace, who slipped&#xD;
the cord from Smuggler's neck. , Feeling him-&#xD;
self at liberty, the animal ran into his master's&#xD;
camp, smelt of the boughs where Madge had.&#xD;
slept, sprang -out with his nose to the ground,&#xD;
and ran toward the trees. Carl6ta as well as&#xD;
Madge watched his movements with intense&#xD;
interest. Smuggler was in the timber in a&#xD;
moment, and as quickly disappeared.&#xD;
" Where is he ?" asked Carl6ta.&#xD;
" In the bushes," said Brace.&#xD;
"Let us follow faster ; we shall lose Tight&#xD;
of him altogether," added Carl6ta.&#xD;
" We've lost sight of him now, but he'll&#xD;
turn up ag'in soon, I reckon," replied Brace,&#xD;
looking about him with evident perplexity.&#xD;
&#xD;
"-Slow-footed idiot !" cried the girl; " if&#xD;
your feet were half as fast as your tongue,&#xD;
you would find him. He was on her trail, I&#xD;
am sure."&#xD;
"That may be true ; but where's the critter&#xD;
now  ?"  '  .       .                  .t&#xD;
Brace stopped close to the cavern.&#xD;
Dogs don't git out o';sight in an onnateral&#xD;
way, do they ?  Can't sink down into the&#xD;
airth, nor go up into the air, can they ?"&#xD;
Brace stared stupidly at Carl6ta.&#xD;
"You have not half the sagacity of the dog,&#xD;
though you may be quite as much of a brute,"&#xD;
retorted Carldta, angrily. "Beat every bush&#xD;
-look behind every rock and tree. We shall&#xD;
find both dog and girl in some hole or covert."&#xD;
Wh'Ie Carl6ta was speaking, she sprang for-&#xD;
ward and stood at the entrance of the ,ave.'&#xD;
Brace, meantime, ran about like one half-dis-&#xD;
tracted, for he dreaded the anger of Carl6ta.&#xD;
The critter dodged us by turnin' on his track,&#xD;
or round a rock ; he may be a mile from here&#xD;
by this time."&#xD;
"Brace, you have strength, but not half the&#xD;
cunning of' a woman. Look here ! What's&#xD;
this ?"&#xD;
Brace hurried to her'; she had parted the&#xD;
bushes, and was pointing downward.&#xD;
"You'll find the dog and the one we seek&#xD;
in there," she added. Then, authoritatively :&#xD;
" Go in, Brace, and bring them out."&#xD;
"I'll look in, first," replied the ruffian.&#xD;
"It's rather dark ; it may be a wolf's den,'-for&#xD;
aught I know. I'm not afeard of an inemy&#xD;
that I can see, but I don't like to be too ven-&#xD;
tur'some in the dark."&#xD;
Brace thrust his burly head into the open-&#xD;
ing, but could see nothing but blackness.&#xD;
"In, I tell you!" commanded Carl6ta, impa-&#xD;
tiently.&#xD;
' The dog will tear me," said Brace, sullenly.&#xD;
' What does it matter? Your flesh will&#xD;
heal again. 'Tisn't so tender and delicate that&#xD;
you need to take such good care of it."&#xD;
Brace slowly pushed his head and shoulders&#xD;
into the darkness. A growl admonished him&#xD;
to forbear.&#xD;
"4What did I tell you ?" cried Carl6ta, tri-&#xD;
umphantly. "She is there ; I knew it."&#xD;
"I can see the dog's eyes ; they blaze like&#xD;
coals !"&#xD;
"Fool! -they are not the dog's-they are&#xD;
her's ; they are fatally bright !" said Carlota,&#xD;
wildly.&#xD;
"Don't I know a gal's eyes from a dog's ?"&#xD;
retorted Brace, sharply. "Give me my rifle ;&#xD;
I'll shoot the critter."&#xD;
Carl6ta pushed the rifle with her foot, so he&#xD;
could reach it, then suddenly seized his arm.&#xD;
" Hold ! I am afraid you will make a mis-&#xD;
take, and rob me of my triumph. Take away&#xD;
your bristly head, and let me look."&#xD;
Madge sat shivering in the remotest limit&#xD;
of the cavern, but' instinctively looked up&#xD;
&#xD;
when Carl6ta looked in. The eyes of the lat-&#xD;
ter seemed to conquer the darkness, for she&#xD;
exclaimed:&#xD;
" Come forth, girl, come forth! I am here&#xD;
-Carl6ta is here. Yield, if you would save&#xD;
the life of your faithful dog; be obstinate,&#xD;
and I will order Brace to shoot him."&#xD;
"Have you no pity-no remorse ?" cried&#xD;
Madge.&#xD;
"For you, none ; for the man I love, a world&#xD;
of both!" responded Carl6ta.&#xD;
" It's best to make an eend o' the dog, any-&#xD;
way," said Brace, in whose memory was treas-&#xD;
ured a former insult.&#xD;
" Order away your ruffian, and I will obey&#xD;
you," said Madge, with dignity. " I feel that&#xD;
resistance to my fate is vain; but in common&#xD;
humanity, I ask you to spare the dog."&#xD;
" Bill Brace, harm a hair of the dog;. and&#xD;
I'll hold your life of less value than his !" said&#xD;
Carldta, imperiously, to her cringing confed-&#xD;
erate.&#xD;
Madge came out, followed by Smuggler--&#xD;
who wished to make an assault upon Brace,&#xD;
who stood with his rifle cocked, ready for such&#xD;
a demonstration;. but, from feelings of mercy&#xD;
to the dog, Madge restrained him.&#xD;
"Woman! Carl6ta! I qm in your power.&#xD;
Dispose of me-as you will; but take me not&#xD;
to yonder Valley."&#xD;
The eyes of the two girls met with an inten-&#xD;
sity of emotion on the part of each-hatred,&#xD;
jealousy, and revenge on the one hand ; wan-&#xD;
der, consternation, and fear on the other.&#xD;
Both were formed fair by Nature, and both&#xD;
silently admitted the fact.&#xD;
" Lead on !" said Carldta to Brace.&#xD;
The latter shook his head sullenly, and re-&#xD;
plied:&#xD;
"I won't trust my back to the;dog, noways.&#xD;
As soon's I turn, the chances are two to one-&#xD;
that he'll spring to my shoulders, and put hi-&#xD;
teeth into the back of my neck. I know the&#xD;
natur' o' Nick Whiffles' dogs. This one isn't&#xD;
so savage as t'other ; but he's l'arnin' his&#xD;
tricks right fast. No, no; miss ! I ain't to be&#xD;
tore to pieces by quadrupids."&#xD;
" Send him away !" said' Carl6ta, sharply,&#xD;
to Madge.&#xD;
" It grieves me to part with him," she an-&#xD;
swered, looking hesitatingly from Brace to&#xD;
Smuggler, as .if measuring the chances of a&#xD;
combat between them.&#xD;
The eyes of the dog followed those of his&#xD;
mistress ; he was evidently ready to try his&#xD;
strength at her bidding.&#xD;
"He's a fine brute ; but you must kill him,&#xD;
Brace," added Carl6ta, after a moment's l'e-&#xD;
flection.&#xD;
"Go, Smuggler, go!" said Madge-" go back&#xD;
'to your master."&#xD;
smuggler looked -at her wistfully, as if to&#xD;
'divine her purpose by her features. It was&#xD;
not until she had repeated her command in a&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
more imperative voice that he obeyed, and&#xD;
then reluctantly-halting, now and then, to&#xD;
see if the order would not be revoked.&#xD;
" Now that you are relieved of the 'ani ul,&#xD;
go on," said Carluta.&#xD;
The mountain robber shouldered his rifle,&#xD;
and moved toward the east. Carl6ta and Madge&#xD;
followed him.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
SEVEN-PLUMES.&#xD;
The rays of the sun gleamed brightly on the&#xD;
varied scenery. The summits of the moun-&#xD;
taun-ranges were tipped with crimson and&#xD;
gold. The long, trembling beams of light&#xD;
gilded the branches of the trees, darted down&#xD;
into the valleys, flickered against the broad&#xD;
surfaces of the rocks, and painted fantastic&#xD;
pictures upon lake and stream. But the&#xD;
charms of Nature were lost upon Madge. A&#xD;
sense of personal peril-a vague apprehension&#xD;
-outweighed. all other considerations. Occa-&#xD;
sionally', Carlsta's eyes kindled as she glanced&#xD;
around her ; but if she found room in her agi-&#xD;
tated breast for the beautiful, she did not ex-&#xD;
press the sentiment. Madge watched for&#xD;
some softening of her expression ; but the&#xD;
feelings that guided her movements were too&#xD;
strong to yield so readily.&#xD;
Madge did not waste words in useless ap-&#xD;
peals ; but followed her silently. She noticed&#xD;
that Brace kept along the margin of the val-&#xD;
lhy, following its general course. Sometimes,&#xD;
the way was exceedingly rough, and her feet&#xD;
were wounded upon the sharp stones ; but&#xD;
the girl of the mountains, more used to such&#xD;
traveling, sprang along after Brace with light-&#xD;
ness and agility. If she unconsciously gained&#xD;
upon Madge, and left her behind, she paused&#xD;
for, her to come ;up-and once helped her&#xD;
across a chasm, tut dropped her hand sud-&#xD;
denly, as if the contact wounded her.&#xD;
They reached a spot where the valley fell'&#xD;
off precipitously.  Madge could look dlown&#xD;
many feet upon -the tops of stunted trees,&#xD;
sterile crags, ledges of red sandstone, and shat-&#xD;
tered columns of basalt. Carleta paused to&#xD;
rest. Madge was glad to recline beneath the&#xD;
shade of acottonwood.&#xD;
It was past noon.   Brace stood on the&#xD;
verge of a precipice, leaning upon his rifle,&#xD;
and looking at the scenery beneath. His face&#xD;
was more serious than usual. Possibly a&#xD;
shadow of the coming event had fallen within&#xD;
the circle of his consciousness, thrilling him&#xD;
with a vague fear. - Madge saw a figure spring&#xD;
from the background and pause on the brink&#xD;
of the abyss. So sudden and unexpected was,&#xD;
the intrusion; that for an instant she was not&#xD;
aware that Brace had disappeared. Carl6ta'&#xD;
uttered an exclamation of surprise. On the,&#xD;
spot where the outlaw was last seen stood a tall&#xD;
and painted form, gazing at the two girls with&#xD;
a grim, etultant look.&#xD;
Although Brace had ever been an object of&#xD;
&#xD;
abhorrence to Madge, she could not repress a&#xD;
chill of horror at his fate. The Indian had&#xD;
hurled him down the precipice._&#xD;
"Treachery ! treachery !" cried Carl6ta.&#xD;
" Redskin, what have you done ?"&#xD;
"Pushed him over ; lie fall great ways-&#xD;
kill him dead! White squaws go with Seven-&#xD;
Plumes. Wigwam ten, 'leven, twenty miiles&#xD;
off," answered the Indian, calmly.&#xD;
"Seven-Plumes has deceived Dick Hen-&#xD;
dricks. How can he tell him a straight story,&#xD;
when lie meets him? He cannot ; his tongue&#xD;
will stammer like a squaw's,".answered Car-&#xD;
ldta, with wonderful self-possession.&#xD;
"The Bear"-Seven-Plumes pointed down&#xD;
the abyss-" had a bad tongue ; lie no speak&#xD;
truth ; lie lie to Seven-Plumes, the chief of&#xD;
the Blackfeet.' He say, he give-he negive.&#xD;
Now he no lie no more."'&#xD;
"The warriors of Seven-Plumes will bleed&#xD;
for this ! The white'chief of the Valley will&#xD;
cause his young men to fall like leaves when&#xD;
the trees are shaken by the wind in the au-&#xD;
tumn of the year," responded Carl6ta, with a&#xD;
menacing gesture.                -&#xD;
. "Seven-Plumes no care for Cap'n Dick!&#xD;
He want one, two squaw ; he find one, two&#xD;
squaw-he take 'em. He fight for Cap'n Dick,&#xD;
too ; but Cap'n Dick he no give him 'nough&#xD;
powder, and lead and hatchet."&#xD;
"I will see that you have all that he agreed&#xD;
to give you,"replied Carl6ta, thinking diploma-&#xD;
cy the best policy.&#xD;
"No want hatchet and powder now; want&#xD;
squaw ;, got squaw-keep him !"&#xD;
Carl6ta struggled to restrain her indignation&#xD;
and disappointment. Fear of captivity did&#xD;
not operate so strongly upon her as the thwart- '&#xD;
ing of her plans.&#xD;
"Do you hear what this redskin says ?" she&#xD;
demanded, almost fiercely of Madge: " he&#xD;
talks of his wigwam and squaws."&#xD;
" It is but a change of masters. I hail this&#xD;
new captivity with different emotions from&#xD;
you. Thraldom with savages -cannot be so&#xD;
dreadful as yonder valley and you," replied&#xD;
Madge.&#xD;
" True, I forgot ; I can hope nothing; from&#xD;
you.  But the wife of a chief! 'Tis mon-&#xD;
strous.!-Seven-Plumes, name the reward that&#xD;
you demand for our freedom. How many&#xD;
rifles, how many hatchets and knives, how&#xD;
many pounds of powder, how much red stuff&#xD;
for your favorite squaws ?"&#xD;
The Indian knit his painted brows. His&#xD;
wild and intractable nature could not brook&#xD;
contradiction. He had enjoyed savage free-&#xD;
dom from infancy ; his will  had been law&#xD;
among his people for many summers. Should,&#xD;
he submit to the dictum of a squaw?&#xD;
" Seven-Plumes is a chief. When lie speak,&#xD;
the great Blackfoot nation do as he say. If&#xD;
he say,' Go on the war-path,' to his young men,&#xD;
they go. If he say, ' Wash the war-paint from&#xD;
your faces,' they come into the wigwams with&#xD;

time. On soil less obdurate, and without' their&#xD;
drawback of watchful enemies, the task ofc&#xD;
tracing the trail of Madge would have&#xD;
been comparatively easy. Signs were found&#xD;
near Devil's Gate, near a spring of water&#xD;
which had saturated the earth ; and their 1&#xD;
proximity to the entrance of the Valley made&#xD;
Pathaway fear that she had either unwittingly 4&#xD;
sought shelter in that dangerous neighbor-&#xD;
hood, or been conducted there by Hendricks&#xD;
or his men.' He wished to explore the gloomy&#xD;
spot; but it was already dark, rendering it im-&#xD;
practicable to find or follow a trace so slight&#xD;
and broken. With extreme reluctance, he&#xD;
yielded to the counsel of the Shoshon6, and re-'&#xD;
traced his steps to the camp at Mimic City to&#xD;
He dreamedof Madge more than ever that&#xD;
night. He saw her in peril and distress. Now4&#xD;
she was with the outlaws at Trapper Valley,&#xD;
suffering every-species of indignity, and nowI&#xD;
she was in captivity to the red men, moment-&#xD;
arily expecting Nick and himself to come to&#xD;
her release. His sleep was so. disturbed dur-&#xD;
ing the first part of the night, that the Sho-&#xD;
shons was up before him in the morning. It1&#xD;
was the hand of the chief that awakened him.&#xD;
from his first refreshing slumbers. Portneuf&#xD;
and Jeanjean were already stirring.&#xD;
" There are four of us," said the latter,&#xD;
" and duties for each. My wound has para-&#xD;
lyzed my efforts too long. Portneuf and I&#xD;
have made up our minds what to do: we will&#xD;
rescue Ninon, or perish in the attempt !"&#xD;
"The feeling is natural and right," said&#xD;
Pathaway.. "I need not warn you that the&#xD;
enterprise will be attended with no common&#xD;
danger. The voyageur has doubtless already&#xD;
informed you of the circumstances. The&#xD;
story of his own sufferings and escape give&#xD;
you an insight into the true character of those&#xD;
with whom you have to deal."&#xD;
" I know all, and will dare all," replied&#xD;
Jean'ean, with energy.&#xD;
" I will use no arguments to dissuade you&#xD;
from. your purpose, for it is laudable ; but in&#xD;
your zealor    inon, do not forget the man&#xD;
who has twice periled his life for her. Re-&#xD;
member Nick shiffies!"&#xD;
" God forbid that I should forget him !" ex-&#xD;
claimed Jeanjean. : " My restored faculties,&#xD;
my consciousness of life and its responsibili-&#xD;
ties-everything that is dear to man-admonish&#xD;
me to remember him. Who that has known&#xD;
him can cease to think of him with pleasure?"&#xD;
&#xD;
The two menshook handswithPathaway and&#xD;
descendedbya long detourtothe Valley. Path-&#xD;
away and the Shoshon6 soon after followed by a&#xD;
more direct route. On the way, they were&#xD;
met by the dog Calamity, alias Misfortune.&#xD;
He had a piece of bark in his mouth, which&#xD;
he dropped at the hunter's feet. Pathaway&#xD;
picked it up, and read the following words,&#xD;
rudely cut with a knife :&#xD;
" IN A PISON DIFFIKILTY. CANT GIT -OUT, I&#xD;
ALLOW. TAKE GOOD KEER 0 THE DOG KALAM-&#xD;
ITY, AND DONT LET IT BE KNOWD DOWN IN THE&#xD;
cLEARINS BUT NICK WHIFFLES IS DOIN WELL."&#xD;
"What says the talking-bark ?". asked the&#xD;
Shoshone.&#xD;
" That our friend is in trouble, and expects&#xD;
no relief. Indian Joe, I fear, betrayed him."&#xD;
" Were the eyes of the gray hunter so dim ?"&#xD;
demanded the chief.&#xD;
"I trusted the boy because he discharged&#xD;
the trust that was reposed in him with fideli-&#xD;
ty," answered Pathaway.&#xD;
"Brave men are not always cunning," re-&#xD;
turned Multnomah. " One may have the&#xD;
strength of the buffalo without the knowledge&#xD;
of the fox or the subtlety of the ser pent. Had&#xD;
the pale-face asked the Shoshone, he would&#xD;
have told him what the smooth-faced boy&#xD;
was," added the Indian, with a slight gesture&#xD;
of contempt.&#xD;
"White men," responded Pathaway, "speak&#xD;
their thoughts, but the red - men disguise&#xD;
them."&#xD;
" Doubledark did not speak his mind to&#xD;
Multnomah. He did not say to his friend : 'I&#xD;
am going with the boy to the Valley, where&#xD;
the voice of the Thunder-Spirit is sometimes&#xD;
heard.' Had he said this, the Shoshone would&#xD;
have told him better."&#xD;
"Doubledark is reputed wise. He baffles&#xD;
his enemies; he has eyes that are not afraid to&#xD;
look at the sun."&#xD;
"The wise' sometimes act without wisdom.&#xD;
The heart of Doubledark was heavy for the&#xD;
pale woman. He no sleep at night, because&#xD;
she was before him in dreams. Heart too soft&#xD;
-risk too much. But Multnomah is his&#xD;
brother, and he goes to find him."&#xD;
" But Madge ?" said Pathaway.&#xD;
"First Nick, then Madge," replied the In-&#xD;
dian.&#xD;
"I cannot and will not object to any reason-&#xD;
able undertaking in behalf of the trapper,&#xD;
Nick ; but the helplessness of the young girl,&#xD;
Madge, appeals continually to my sympa-&#xD;
thies."&#xD;
They had now reached the spot where they&#xD;
had found the trail of Madge on the previous&#xD;
night. Pathaway hung anxiously over the im-&#xD;
printof her little feet, while the chief observed&#xD;
him in silence.&#xD;
"The Shoshons," said the young man, at&#xD;
length, " is older than I ; he understands&#xD;
what is good, and I will listen to his words."&#xD;
"Multnoinah knows the thoughts of .the&#xD;

his spirit is heavy for the fair face of the girl.&#xD;
But'young men are apt to be hasty. Listen&#xD;
to the talk of Multnomah, and if it is no good,&#xD;
no take it."&#xD;
The chief pointed at Nick's dog, and added:&#xD;
"He come from Doubledark-he knows the&#xD;
way back."&#xD;
" True !" said the young man, struck with&#xD;
the idea. " He can, without doubt, find his&#xD;
master. I am ready to go."&#xD;
The dog, meantime, had turned toward&#xD;
Devil's Gate, and was looking back over his&#xD;
shoulder at the Indian and Pathaway.&#xD;
" Go on, dog, go on !" said the latter, and&#xD;
the animal, with ears erect, and a satisfied wag&#xD;
of the tail, sprang into the tunnel. The pas-&#xD;
sage had lost none of its gloominess since the&#xD;
young man visited it. Itsrough and timne-worn&#xD;
port s frowned grimly on them as they enter-&#xD;
ed, and though the morning sun was beaming&#xD;
brightly, its rays penetrated but a short dis-&#xD;
tance into the passage, falling refracted and&#xD;
broken on. rock and column.&#xD;
" Feet have walked here since the sun came&#xD;
up," saidaMultnomah.&#xD;
"How do you know-?" asked -Pathaway.&#xD;
"Look !" returned the chief. " Here is a&#xD;
sign."&#xD;
Trhe hunter stooped over the spot indicated&#xD;
by the Indian, and detected the imprint of a&#xD;
damp moccasmn.   -       ..&#xD;
"Yes," he answered, "some of the moun-&#xD;
taineers have left the Valley recently."&#xD;
" Let my brother be dumb. To-day they go&#xD;
out and they come in. Cap'n Dick watch very&#xD;
sharp."&#xD;
"My tongue is sealed," returned the young&#xD;
man, and threaded his way noislessly after the&#xD;
Shoshone, the dog keeping a few paces in ad-&#xD;
vance. A portion of the distance they could&#xD;
not see' their canine guide, but occasionally&#xD;
heard his feet upon the stones. They issued&#xD;
from the darkness without accident, and pass.&#xD;
ing the boiling spring, arrived at the stream,&#xD;
which they were about to cross, when they&#xD;
perceived that the dog had stopped in the&#xD;
middle of it. This pause was of short duration,&#xD;
for the moment he found that the circumstance&#xD;
had attracted their notice, he walked down the&#xD;
bed of he stream to a point where it ran be-&#xD;
neath an arch of sandstone, and was lost to&#xD;
view. Under this arch their fore-footed guide&#xD;
disappeared.&#xD;
" Dad men hide from the sunlight like owls,"&#xD;
muttered the Indian.&#xD;
In a moment they were in titter darkness,&#xD;
guided only by thq splashing of the dog's feet&#xD;
in the water. Pathaway did not remember&#xD;
that he had ever experienced such a feeling of&#xD;
complete isolation. Could one be more hidden&#xD;
from the world? he queried. What if a frag-&#xD;
ment of rock should fall from the dark roof and&#xD;
shut there in ? He shuddered as the thought&#xD;
shot through his mind. He could not resist&#xD;
epituring some of the horrors of such a fate.&#xD;
The air was damp and chilly,.and the walls,&#xD;
&#xD;
MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS.&#xD;
when he touched them in feeling his way for-&#xD;
ward, felt like blocks of ice.&#xD;
By-and-by a thread of light appeared, but&#xD;
which was much farther off than it at first&#xD;
seemed; it grew stronger as they advanced,&#xD;
and crept down, as they perceived, through a&#xD;
cleft in the rook. Both parties hailed the light&#xD;
of day with satisfaction.&#xD;
While pausing to breathe the fresher air and&#xD;
catch a glimpse of the upper world, Multno-&#xD;
mah's eyes fell uponan extinguished and half-&#xD;
burned torch thrust into a crevice, where it&#xD;
had been placed, doubtless, by some one for&#xD;
future use. The torch was at once lighted by&#xD;
means of one of Pathaway's pistols, the dog&#xD;
waiting for them  impatiently. They, soon&#xD;
reached a spot where the subterranean way&#xD;
suddenly widened, and the ceiling was more&#xD;
lofty.' The stream ran onward in a narrow&#xD;
bed, while there was firm and comparatively&#xD;
dry footing to the right and left.&#xD;
Calamity now darted forward to the right, at&#xD;
right angles with the stream, and presently&#xD;
they heard him bark loudly. Both quickened&#xD;
their steps. The light fell upon a dark chasm,&#xD;
upon the brink of which the dog was standing.&#xD;
Multnomah approached it carefully, and sink-&#xD;
ing upon his knees, held the torch over the-&#xD;
abyss.             .    .&#xD;
" Nicholas ! Nicholas !" said Pathaway, in a&#xD;
low voice.&#xD;
There was no answ r to this call.&#xD;
"He must' be here, ' added the young man-&#xD;
"The instincts of the dog cannot err. Nicholas !&#xD;
Nicholas !..&#xD;
He spoke louder, but his voice seemed to&#xD;
rebound from the abyss as if the darkness below&#xD;
were impenetrable even to sound.&#xD;
Calamitybayed persistently, his heavy voice&#xD;
echoing over their heads like a volley of inus-&#xD;
ketrv.&#xD;
"IHullo! you there,- dog ?" hailed a voice&#xD;
that appeared to come from a great distance.&#xD;
" Could you raise any body to come arter me,&#xD;
old feller, or must I make up my mind to give&#xD;
up things of a subliunar nature in this pesky&#xD;
hole.".&#xD;
" Nick ! Nick !" shouted Pathaway. " Your&#xD;

" Ls that you, Colonel? I'm glad to hear a&#xD;
human voice. I'm in a prison diffikilty, I swear&#xD;

belonged to Nick Whiffies.&#xD;

hunter.&#xD;
" Yes, alive, but the condemned boy carried&#xD;

&#xD;
b&#xD;
&#xD;
plased by Carl6ta. To make it fast and lower&#xD;
one end into the shaft, was the work of a few&#xD;
moments. The young man feared Nick would&#xD;
not have strength enough to ascend, and ex-&#xD;
pressed himself to that effect.&#xD;
" Not a bit on't, colonel !" said Nicholas, as&#xD;
he commenced climbing. "These muskles o'&#xD;
mine are 'the right kind for sarvice. They've&#xD;
been tried a thousand times, and there isn't a&#xD;
weak spot in 'em. There's no useless fat on&#xD;
'em. Fat, colonel, is the enemy of muskies.&#xD;
For strength and hardihood nothing' is wantin'&#xD;
but the solid flesh. Here I come, you see I"&#xD;
Nicholas ascended the rope hand over hand,&#xD;
but the gray hunter perceived that the action&#xD;
cost him more effort *than he was willing to&#xD;
acknowledge. Calamity, meantime, stood with&#xD;
his forefeet on the verge of the shaft, watch-&#xD;
ing the -progress of his master. His bushy&#xD;
tail wagged with satisfaction, while his large&#xD;
eyes sparkled with joy as he reached the sur-&#xD;
face.-.&#xD;
Pathaway and the Shoshons each caught&#xD;
him by an arm and drew him from his living&#xD;
sepulchre. The veteran did not speak, but&#xD;
sank upon the hard floor of the cavern. -&#xD;
The dog leaped upon his shoulders, licked&#xD;
his face, rubbed his great head against his&#xD;
cheeks, laid.down u pon him, rolled over, made&#xD;
a sound like a dumb person trying to speak,&#xD;
and a hundred dog-demonstrations of delight.&#xD;
The trapper put his arms around his neck,&#xD;
and for a short time rested.his' damp forehead&#xD;
upon it.&#xD;
" To Providence fust," he murmured, "to&#xD;
you next, and the humans arterward. These&#xD;
s the sentiments of Nick Whiffles, and. on&#xD;
this platform 'you'll find him. Yes," he re-&#xD;
peated, as if communing with himself, " on&#xD;
this here platform you'll find him.' 'Tisn't&#xD;
the loudest thanksgiving, " he went on serious-*&#xD;
ly, " that's the deepest, and the most accept-&#xD;
able to the Master o' Life. It may be said,&#xD;
prehaps it has been said, that I haven't them&#xD;
feelin's o' rev'rence, that dependent critters'&#xD;
oughter have ; but howsomenever that mayt&#xD;
be-and I'won't be so presumptuous as to be&#xD;
my own jdge-I do feel rdfor liewhen&#xD;
it's spared, and for the kind marcy and'pro-.&#xD;
teetion of the Power that can see into the e&#xD;
vaults of the mountings with a- clearer eye&#xD;
nor the sun can look down upon the peraries l&#xD;
at noonday."  Nick drewhis brown handr&#xD;
slowly across his eyes. .&#xD;
No one interrupted him. The Shoshonec&#xD;
looked  avely toward the murky roof above ,e&#xD;
hi, andPathaway was sensibly affected.  -&#xD;
Dogs,' continued the trapper anon, " was s&#xD;
ade fotr man, and when they'ree well-used, -&#xD;
they're true and never-faili friends. Lose&#xD;
everything you've got, be turned out o' house i&#xD;

and your dog'll foller ye all the same. Patches i&#xD;

-the dog don't-when you're in disgrace, and&#xD;
at last will howl over your grave in giniwine&#xD;
grief when there's not a human beim' to drop&#xD;
a tear on it."&#xD;
Nicholas placed his hand on the shaggy&#xD;
head, and tie eyes beneath beamed on bin&#xD;
with unspeakable affection..&#xD;
CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
THE oUTAws AT neat.&#xD;
Nick Whiffes arose and stood erect.&#xD;
" Colonel," he said, stretching out his hand,&#xD;
" I thank ye! '.Thank ye' is werds that is&#xD;
easy spoke, but not allers felt."&#xD;
"It would be unjust, Nicholas, to take mueh&#xD;
credit to myself fdr your rescue.: To the&#xD;
chief of the Shoshones you ae, so nmck i -&#xD;
debted, that it would be unpardonable in .me&#xD;
not to make particular mention of 1#s n me.'&#xD;
" It's the modesty o' youth,"       the&#xD;
trapper, and it's a thing I like to see in these&#xD;
days when boys think the 're en afore the&#xD;

"It is as ,Doubledark says; Miltnomash&#xD;
knows what is in his heart," returned the&#xD;
chief.&#xD;
"Sartin," returned Nicks "IIt's your na-&#xD;

The Indian did not answer, but mi   g'a&#xD;
gesture of silence, walked quickly to tie grub.&#xD;

him stop and stand in a fixed and listening ast&#xD;
titude.&#xD;
P'athaway was holding the tireh, and its&#xD;
rays glimmered feebly against the person of&#xD;
the'chief, making him resemble a piece of iron&#xD;
statuary.&#xD;
"It's nat'ral to hin, aat'ral to him," whim.&#xD;

"Wrong, trapper, wrong for once ! I hear&#xD;
the distant splashin of water," he said.&#xD;
Nicholas stretched his person upon the floor&#xD;
of the cavern with a quickness that;was like&#xD;
the spring of a cat. For a space he was im-&#xD;
mobile as the solid foundation beneath him.&#xD;
" It is very well--very well, indeed, for a&#xD;
beginner," he said, approvingly., "And not&#xD;
that, neither, but mighty cute in one that&#xD;
hasn't trod the peraries many years. There&#xD;
is splashin' in the water I If you've, you'll&#xD;
yit be able to walk side an' side with the&#xD;
Shoshone."&#xD;
" Your good opinion is gratifying. A word&#xD;
of praise from Nick Whiffles is something to&#xD;
be proud of. The sounds, trapper, come this,&#xD;
way."_&#xD;
"And the Ingin, too.  It's a right good&#xD;
-hing, colonel, to have a critter of so much&#xD;
sagacity to help us in the time o' need. Now&#xD;
f nw from his manner, by the way he walks&#xD;
and the *ay he looks (and it comes of bem'&#xD;
with him) that he's made up his mind what to&#xD;
do."  47&#xD;
Tho     words of Multnomah verified the&#xD;
predietio   Nicholas.&#xD;
"Co     down the water-two, three, four.&#xD;
White "en."&#xD;
The ohief plucked the torch fom the cre-&#xD;
'Ac, and swinging it to increase the baze,&#xD;
strode with all the rapidity compatible with&#xD;
wariness into the dark background. Patha-&#xD;
way noticed that Nick followed him with un-&#xD;
wavering confidence, and his own spirits arose&#xD;
responsive to his evident assurance. He feared,&#xD;
that the cave was not sufficiently capacious to&#xD;
afford them a secure hiding-place from those&#xD;
who approached ; but his apprehensions were&#xD;
speedily dispelled by the increasing extension&#xD;
of the subterranean vault. The floor was now&#xD;
clayey and damp. The chief turned around&#xD;
a sharp abutment of earth and extinguished&#xD;
the torch. .dsildtb&#xD;
Nick was as quieted as little disturbed as&#xD;
if in his own solitary but, a score of miles&#xD;
from a known enemy.&#xD;
Pathaway wished to question the Shoshone,&#xD;
but with the satisfied example of Nick before&#xD;
him, restrained the impulse. He was wise&#xD;
enough to comprehend, that if -one older and&#xD;
more experienced than himself was perfectly&#xD;
reliant on the knowledge and trustworthiness&#xD;
of the Shoshone, he should also manifest the&#xD;
same faith and "onfidence. He therefore com-&#xD;
posed his features, and appeared as stoical as&#xD;
possible. Wisdorp, perhaps, consists in imi-&#xD;
tating those supposed to'know more than our-&#xD;
aelis. this is the philosophy of the world,&#xD;
at least, and is acted daily by those who wish&#xD;
tai  per well in the eyes of pseudo society.&#xD;
.  o young man lated, maot without secret&#xD;
a1ety,,the development of events." It is far&#xD;
itZyto exercise the higher qualities of&#xD;
thelnan mind than to read ofthem; and&#xD;
for a time even the brave spirit of Pathaway&#xD;
&#xD;
MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS.&#xD;
was agitated by suspense. The consciousness&#xD;
that he was armed, and supported also by two&#xD;
persons of tried courage and constancy, in-&#xD;
spired him with confidence not easily shaken.&#xD;
The splashing of the water was now such as&#xD;
to indicate the proximity of the coming  ar-&#xD;
ties. The light from their torches, too, gum-&#xD;
mered on the passing stream and flickered&#xD;
upon the rocky roof among the drooping sta-&#xD;
lactites, and the large drops of water collected&#xD;
upon the sharp points, just read yto drop.&#xD;
Looking from behind the protect ing angle,&#xD;
Pathaway and his companions saw a man&#xD;
emerge from the subterranean passage, bear-&#xD;
ing a toch in his.right hand. It was Dick&#xD;
Hendricks. His left arm was bandaged and&#xD;
in a sling, while his features were pale from&#xD;
loss of blood apparently. The blaze shining&#xD;
on his face revealed in a striking manner the pe-&#xD;
cular hardness and recklessness of his nature.&#xD;
The hunter experienced an unpleasant thrill&#xD;
of astonishment at beholding the next object&#xD;
that presented itself. Andrew Jeanjean came&#xD;
after the outlaw captain, his countenance near-&#xD;
ly as pallid as that of the latter, and hii hands&#xD;
secured by a cord about the wrists. This un-&#xD;
expected spectacle gave the young man unal-&#xD;
loyed pain. He would have observed the via-&#xD;
ages of his comrades but for the obscurity.&#xD;
Walking behind the prisoner appeared three&#xD;
armed men.&#xD;
What did this portend ?  A visit to such a-&#xD;
locality, under such circumstances, could have&#xD;
no good for its object, and Pathaway trembled&#xD;
for the trapper's fate..&#xD;
Jeanjean's expression was firm and resigned&#xD;
-like one conscious of peril, yet resolved to&#xD;
meet it with becoming manliness. As Hen-&#xD;
dricks ushered him into the cavern, he threw&#xD;
an inquiring,-earnest look around him, and&#xD;
his cheeks, the hunter thought, grew paler.&#xD;
The robber captain flourished his torch till&#xD;
his menacing face seemed set in a circle of&#xD;
fire, then approached the shaft with cautious&#xD;
yet hasty steps. An indignant glow warmed&#xD;
the hunter's blood.  The pulsations of his&#xD;
heart grew quick with expectation, nor could&#xD;
he refrain from drawing Nick farther behind&#xD;
the abutment, and whispering :&#xD;
"Nicholas,[ am sure I can depend on you,&#xD;
Nicholas, if5 kything dreadful is to be pre.'&#xD;
vented."&#xD;
"I think so, colonel, I think so !" returned&#xD;
Nick, pressing the young man's hand.   ou&#xD;
haven't knowed me a great while par   ally,&#xD;
but. you've heerd of me, and can form some&#xD;
idee what my natur' is."&#xD;
Pathaway gratefull returned the pressure&#xD;
of the trapper's hand, and hurried back to&#xD;
watch the progress of events.,&#xD;
"Where's the rope ?" asked lHendricks, in&#xD;
a tote that indicated that his temper had been&#xD;
recently ruffed.&#xD;
"It's hanging' in the hole, oap'n," answered&#xD;
one of his fellows.&#xD;
&#xD;
I.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Ninon, my poor Ninon !" exclaimed Jean&#xD;
can, dejectedly, while his breast heaved wit]&#xD;
emotion.I&#xD;
"Go down !" said Hendricks, pointing t&#xD;
the ropewith his torch.&#xD;
Andrew turned toward Hendricks and re&#xD;
plied :-&#xD;
"I have followed you hither because I could&#xD;
not resist your will. I came to the Valley o&#xD;
an errand of meroy, but unfortunately fell in&#xD;
to your power.  From you, Richard Hen&#xD;
dlricks, I expect little kindness, yet I do en&#xD;
tr. at of you to pause before you proceed t&#xD;
burden your soul with another crime. Stop&#xD;
here in your career, restore the voyageur's&#xD;
daughter to liberty, and here in this deep aid&#xD;
secret sepulchre resolve to change your mod&#xD;
of life. Reflect a moment, Hendricks ; ask&#xD;
yourself if wrong done to a fellow-being wil&#xD;
bring quietude and happiness.&#xD;
" Go down !" repeated Hendricks, gruffly.&#xD;
" Life is sweet to the young," muttered&#xD;
Jeanjean, sighing.&#xD;
"1I tell you to go down 1" cried Hendricks,&#xD;
fiercely.&#xD;
"If my hands were free, you would be less&#xD;
insolent, Dick Hendricks !" retorted Jeaujean.&#xD;
" Fools !" exclaimed Hendricks, addressing&#xD;
his men, " untie his hands."&#xD;
Andrew's hands were at liberty in moment.&#xD;
"Now," added Hendricks, drawing a pistol,&#xD;
" there is nothing to hinder you from goin'&#xD;
down that rope. Don't trifle, for I'm busy&#xD;
to-day, and it-isn't safe to contradict me."'&#xD;
"If I am to die," said Jeanjean, struggling&#xD;
to maintain his composure, givee me at least&#xD;
a quick and decent death."&#xD;
" Go down, and we'll talk of that when we&#xD;
have more time !" retorted the captain, mo-&#xD;
rosely, cocking his pistol.&#xD;
Jeanjean looked hopelessly up at the damp&#xD;
roof, to the right, to the left, then down at&#xD;
the dark abyss, leading he knew not whither,&#xD;
designed, perhaps, to be his sepulchre.&#xD;
" Choose, whether you will go down by the&#xD;
law of gravitation, or by your own muscles,"&#xD;
said the captain, advancing the muzzle of his&#xD;
pistol to within a few inches of Andrew's head.&#xD;
Pathaway beheld this scene with feelings&#xD;
that.he could scarcely restrain. Once he was,&#xD;
on the point of bounding from his hiding-&#xD;
place and hurling the robber ,trapper into the&#xD;
shaft, but the hand of Nicholas grasping his&#xD;
arm, kept him back. The figure of the Sho-&#xD;
shons rested against the abutment as if cut in&#xD;
relief upon the wall. The hunter could see,&#xD;
dimly the dusky outlines of his person, fixed&#xD;
and undemonstrative. ,&#xD;
Andrew Jeanjean breathed heavily, then&#xD;
stooping and seizing the rope, began to de.s&#xD;
send. Captain Dick replaced his pistol with&#xD;
a grim smile, and- partly drew 'a bowie from&#xD;
his belt. A demon within him was tempting&#xD;
hiin to cut the rope. A suspicion of such a&#xD;
thing appeared to cross the mind of Jeanjean;&#xD;
&#xD;
- for Pathaway saw his pale, anxious &amp;amp;e turned&#xD;
i upward an instant toward the light from which&#xD;
oe was passing, then the pallid countenance&#xD;
,o sank,.lower and lower till 'it was covered by&#xD;
the darkness of the abyss. The vibrationsof&#xD;
the rope as Andrew swung to and fro in his&#xD;
descent, were visible some time, then, when all&#xD;
d tension   pon it had Ceased, it was hastily&#xD;
n drawn ip.&#xD;
-    "The critter'll be safe there till-he's want-&#xD;
- ed," muttered Captain Dick.  "There's too&#xD;
- many sich fellers prowlin' round' the Valley.&#xD;
o We must put an end to this spin' business, or&#xD;
the ropes are'twisted that'llhang us. None&#xD;
s on us will be obleeged to wait till hemp grows if&#xD;
I sich chaps as NickWhifles and thatyoung vag-&#xD;
e abond, Pathaway, are allowed to have their way.&#xD;
" That's true, cap'i, and I've always said&#xD;
l so," responded one of his followers.&#xD;
"I wish they were all in there," continued&#xD;
Hen'dricks, shaking his fl4over .the shaft.&#xD;
I" Our business will never flo'utish till they are&#xD;
out of the way. All has gone wrong since&#xD;
they come to this i-egion. There's Garlsta&#xD;
has got her head full'of strange notions, and&#xD;
seems to be bewitched arter this young hunter&#xD;
in gray. We shall have a company of United&#xD;
States soldiers on us next, I s'pose."&#xD;
He drew his hand over his ruled face im-&#xD;
patiently.&#xD;
"Then there's Seven-Plumes ; he's not to&#xD;
be trusted I'm afeard, We might. have ex.&#xD;
terminated 'em all if his red scoundrels hadn t&#xD;
give back at the fust fire. If I'd had a half&#xD;
dozen of my own fellers with me, the thing&#xD;
would been done.   Come, boys, let's leave&#xD;
this devil-den and -start. up our game again.&#xD;
It's a long road that hasn't no turn in't.&#xD;
Good-by, Jeanjean I" he shouted,' hoatsely,&#xD;
then retreated with his fellows.&#xD;
"If your road isn't longer than I think 'tis,&#xD;
it'll have a turn soon, and a round turn, too,"&#xD;
muttered Nick, whose feelings required instant&#xD;
expression. " If I'd my shootin'-iron, I allow&#xD;
I should drawed a bead on him, but things&#xD;
isn't allers as we want 'em, though I 's'p se all&#xD;
works for the best in the Bend.u-You seeas to&#xD;
be narvous, colonel."&#xD;
" Impatient, angry, if youwill?     lied&#xD;
the hunter,.with a logbreath .     rep&#xD;
The footsteps of Hendricks and his men&#xD;
rapidly receded.&#xD;
"There's somethin' in surgery " resxumed&#xD;
Nick, "a sight in surgery, colone  I as i-&#xD;

leges hanging down into the chasm, and sang&#xD;
in a voice not entirely musical, a fragment of&#xD;

IiXy sweetheart was a bloomin' flower,&#xD;

I lurked at midnight round her bower,&#xD;
-And wished, I had the trapper's darter.&#xD;
Oh, the trapper's darter.!&#xD;
Oh, the-trapper's darter !"&#xD;
Nick bent forward and listened, but getting&#xD;
no response, went on :&#xD;
" Her eyes was like, two stars agleamin',&#xD;
Her face was fair, her lips was sweet;&#xD;
Her smile was alleis. on me beamin',&#xD;
I knelt, I reckon, at-her feet.&#xD;
Oh, the trapper's darter !&#xD;
Oh, the, trapper's darter !"&#xD;
"Who sings? Who, for Heaven's sake, is&#xD;
there ?- eried Jeanjean, whose lips surprise at&#xD;
irst kept mute.&#xD;
" Nick Whiffesind others, and the best'on't&#xD;
is We are at your sarvice," replied the trapper.&#xD;
" Here's the colonel and the Shoshons, and&#xD;
here'e a rope that I'm going' to fling down to&#xD;
eu to cerne up on. Look out fort--it's comin'.&#xD;

But I had a friend--though he uses four legs&#xD;

though he didn't stan' by me exactly neither,&#xD;
but went for' help."&#xD;
The tension on the rope indicated that An.&#xD;
drew, was, ascending. Pathaway awaited, not&#xD;
without trepidation, the result. Presently, af-&#xD;
ter several pauses, Jeanjean appeared at the top&#xD;
of'the shaft, and was drawn out by his friends.&#xD;
"'This is indeed 'ungxpected!I' he gasped,&#xD;
exhibiting strong emotion. 6"I had given up&#xD;
all hope of rescue, and bewildered and over-&#xD;
powered by misfortune, was striving to recon-&#xD;

&#xD;
The parties moved toward the outlet.&#xD;
Reaching the little stream, Nicholas refreshed&#xD;
himself b  a copious draught-of its cooling&#xD;
waters. The Shoshone, bearing the torch, led&#xD;
the way, and in a little while they passed from&#xD;
beneath the damp and dripping arch to the&#xD;
open air.&#xD;
Jeanjean and Nick assuredly felt grateful, for&#xD;
moisture gathered in theireyes as they turned&#xD;
their facesto the golden sun.&#xD;
" I'snever buried alive afore-myself, but my&#xD;
gran'father, the historian, rode through a ken-&#xD;

with the dead wives, and the live wives with&#xD;
the dead husbands. He didn't stay there on'y&#xD;
long enough to bait his hoss and make 'a few&#xD;
memorandums a settin' in his sulky."&#xD;
The hunter looked at Nick to see if he really&#xD;
believed in his grandfather, but the trapper&#xD;
was gazing persistently at vacancy. The Sho-&#xD;
shoue east the torch into the stream, end the&#xD;
waters bore it hissing from sight, then spring-&#xD;
ing lightly from rock to rock, he guided the par-&#xD;
ties silently and-swiftly from Trapper Valley.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXVI.&#xD;
THE MOUNTAINEER.&#xD;
The shades of night were darkening the&#xD;
mountains before the faint and faltering foot-"&#xD;
steps of the captives admonished Seven-&#xD;
Plumes that a halt was needful.  He selected&#xD;
a sheltered spot, and seemed anxious to make&#xD;
his fair prisoners as comfortable as circum-&#xD;
stances would permit. He prepared for them&#xD;
a couch of boughs, spread his own blanket&#xD;
upon it, and told them to sleep. Both, as&#xD;
may readily be believed, were too much agi-&#xD;
tated by the events of the day, and their no-&#xD;
vel and precarious situation -to entertain for a&#xD;
moment the idea of slumber. Madge thought&#xD;
of the gray hunter and Nick ; of the first with&#xD;
a hope of his coming; of the second, with feel-&#xD;
ings of sadness and apprehension. She pie-&#xD;
tured to herself how brave the young man-'&#xD;
Pathaway-would be on the trail; how skill'&#xD;
fully he would discover the lightest ressure&#xD;
of her feet ; how fearlessly he would thread&#xD;
their winding course ; how generously he&#xD;
would sacrifice himself, and how heroically he&#xD;
would bear himself, when, having reached&#xD;
their lonely and cheerless bivouac, lie should&#xD;
meet their captor band 'to hand. These, it&#xD;
was true, were but dreams of fancy that float-&#xD;
ed through her mind, as she reclined upon the&#xD;
earth, looking at tthe changeless face of the&#xD;
Indian, -who had seated himself a short dis-&#xD;
tance from them, with his gun beside him, and&#xD;
his swarthy brow resting upon the palm of his&#xD;
hand.'&#xD;
Carl6ta was less calm, her countenance indi-&#xD;
cating varying emotions. Her cheeks, now&#xD;
white, now red;evidenced a storm within not&#xD;
easily stilled.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Night," said Seven-ln  s. is the time&#xD;
for sleep. Let the white flowers rest."i&#xD;
"4Talk not of rest, treacherous chief  Cap-&#xD;
tives cannot sleep. Send us back to 'Cr&#xD;
lodges, and our sorrows will pass like the&#xD;
clouds, and sleep will cross the thresholds of&#xD;
our eyes with steps lighter than the flitting&#xD;
of a  adow," answered Carldta.&#xD;
" The Saskatchewan prairies lie along the&#xD;
river, and they are beautiful,", said the chief.&#xD;
" The lodge of Seven-Plumes shall be set up&#xD;
near the best hunting-grounds."&#xD;
"We are of one people-and you of another,&#xD;
and it cannot be," answered Carl6ta, with em-&#xD;
phasis. "Carlvta, the child of the mountains,&#xD;
would die rather than enter the lodge of an In-&#xD;
dian chief, to light his fire and cook his meat."&#xD;
Seven-Plumes composed himself in an atti-&#xD;
tude of rest, but deigned no reply.&#xD;
" Speak to him I" said Cardt a to Madge.&#xD;
"Change his purpose by ingenious appeals to,&#xD;
his pride and magnanimity."&#xD;
"'Tis useless; I cannot move him if I&#xD;
would,-and I again assure you-that I hail this&#xD;
captivity as light compared with that I should&#xD;
have suffered from you, had not matters taken&#xD;
this unexpected turn."&#xD;
"Would you he the wife of yonder beast 2"4&#xD;
retorted Carlvta, angrily. -1&#xD;
" Talk not ofit. I hope for a better fate;&#xD;
and my greatest-apprehension is, that my un-&#xD;
lucky star-will again place me in your hands."&#xD;
With a sharp epithet of reproach, Carldta&#xD;
turned- her back upon Madge, and tried to t&#xD;
shake her purpose no more, indulging bitter-&#xD;
ly in her' own wayward and contradictory&#xD;
emotions.                              r&#xD;
The night rolled on. Mildly the moon and&#xD;
her starry court looked down upon the wil- s&#xD;
derness. The prairie-dog barked, the wolf a&#xD;
howled, and the panther shrieked in the dis- i&#xD;
tance.&#xD;
The temporary camp was in an open spot at i&#xD;
-the base of a mountain, shut in on one side by  o&#xD;
oaks, and on the other by mesquit and other n&#xD;
shrubbery.                                 c&#xD;
Made closed her eyes and pretended to   I&#xD;
sleep, but started at the slightest sound, and t&#xD;
invariably saw the fixed form of the Indian oc- t&#xD;
cupying the same place.*                  s&#xD;
- I'm afraid !" muttered Carl6ta, shivering. g&#xD;
" It is lonely and so dismal," she added, as if s&#xD;
speaking to herself. With these words she&#xD;
softly approached the chief, and with some  p&#xD;
signs of repugnance seated herself on the v&#xD;
ground near him, casting ,timid glances from  P&#xD;
aide 'to side. If her fear was feigned, it was eer- li&#xD;
tainly a close imitation of nature, and if Seven. w&#xD;
Plumes was cognizant of it,. he as well as t&#xD;
Madge was probably deceived if it were not .&#xD;
closely abodt her, and put herself in an attitude  b&#xD;
that indicated an intention to sleep. Seven-&#xD;
Plumes, didnot stir, nor betray in any manner&#xD;
that he had seen this movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
Madge observed that Carlbta's dress careless.&#xD;
]y covered a part of the Indian's gun, but had&#xD;
no suspicion that it was otherwise than acci-&#xD;
dental. Madge was now really sleepy. The&#xD;
fatig es nn  watehings of the.last few daya&#xD;
hnd worn upon her naturally dlieate frame.&#xD;
Excitement only, had kept her. from sinning.&#xD;
A kindl of apathy stole over her. Carlitaand&#xD;
the chief gradually receded from her -vision ;&#xD;
a dark screen seemed let down between her&#xD;
aid surrounding   bj cts.. She Passed from&#xD;
the outward world of danger and alarm to the&#xD;
inner one of safety and quietude.&#xD;
She awoke without knowing why ; awoke&#xD;
as sleepers often do, *ith a vague thrill of ter-&#xD;
ror. She glanced at Carl6ta and the chief;&#xD;
they sat there like two images of stone. :The&#xD;
moon had waned but little in the heavens, and&#xD;
she knew that her sleep had been of short du-&#xD;
ration. She turned her wandering gaze up&#xD;
the steep ascent of the mountain. Far, far in&#xD;
the mist of the night, she saw the peaks of the'&#xD;
eternal ranges,' stern and- cold. , She turned&#xD;
her regards to the opposite quarter and saw a&#xD;
slight tremulous motion in the mesquit.&#xD;
A fox or a hare lias left his covert, she&#xD;
thought ; and she continued to watch that in-&#xD;
dication of life, with an interest that -people&#xD;
sometimes feel in trifles. The agitation drew&#xD;
nearer the open space. For a few seconids it&#xD;
ceased ; then uprose from the foliage, a 'figure&#xD;
grim and eager, and smutched with blood,&#xD;
Made recognized, with a thrill of horror, in&#xD;
the sallow and ghastly face, the  features' of&#xD;
Bill Brace. The discovery paralyzed her. A&#xD;
superstitious dread fell aupo aher.sensesAwig&#xD;
bewildering power.&#xD;
A slight noise alarmed Seven-Plumes, He'&#xD;
seized his gun, but the hands of Carlsta were&#xD;
already grasping it. He tried to wrest it from.&#xD;
ier, but she maintained her hold with deter.&#xD;
mined tenacity. he had seen Brace, and&#xD;
knew that he needed, but the delay of a see-&#xD;
nd, and she gained it for him. Thenext&#xD;
mo ent the chief was beaten 4own by. the&#xD;
rushing weight of the nountaineer. But the&#xD;
Indian was litie and supple,,and 'it was not euls&#xD;
o retain him in his grasp'; he vas posseed&#xD;
oo, of great personal strength. He quickly&#xD;
lipped from beneath Brace, and a fierce stug-&#xD;
;le followed, of which Madg was a terrified&#xD;
pectator.&#xD;
Carldta would willingly have aided the trap-&#xD;
ier, but the rapid evolutions of the two-pre.&#xD;
rented her interposition. At leath Seven.&#xD;
Plumes received another fall, butghded snake.&#xD;

heard only the noise of her own flight. To&#xD;

gds and tangled mesquit. Never before had&#xD;
that rugged way been pressed by feetso dainty.-&#xD;
She Was soon weary, and sat down in a strip of&#xD;
timber that skirteda small prairie. Above her&#xD;
was the dim itch of heaven,-studded with the&#xD;

earth, in the verdure of which reposed the&#xD;

Madge, With ready apprehension, realized.&#xD;
the- frightful isolation of her situation,; but&#xD;
delicate and sensitive as she was, the name of&#xD;
Carl6ta was more fearful than all. The hoot-&#xD;
ugof an o*l in a tree overhead gave her a&#xD;
sadden terror ; while the cry of a far-off eats-&#xD;
monit produced an involuntary tremor. Pre-&#xD;
sently, she heard the leaping of an animal ; it&#xD;
came bounding toward her.; she could hear its&#xD;
feet strike the leaves. She doubted not that&#xD;
the panther-'- the shriek of Which she had&#xD;
heard, had scented her steps, and was coming&#xD;
to devour her. Her blood flowed sloggishly&#xD;
in her veins; she felt cold and faint. She&#xD;
thought of making an effort- to escape ; but&#xD;
what aeed could elude the arrow-like swift-&#xD;
nets ofan animal so dreaded-what sagacity&#xD;
thro  hin from the trail ? She sank upon ber&#xD;
knees and covered her face,'and awaited, with&#xD;
trembling horror, the coming of the beast,&#xD;
The sound of leaping dreW nearer and nearer,&#xD;
and Madge's heart nearly ceased to beat, The&#xD;

&#xD;
With the dog crouching. beside her, she&#xD;
waited patiently for the return of day, firm in&#xD;
the belief that her canine protector would not&#xD;
desert her.&#xD;
It was near morning. The shadowy ob-&#xD;
scurity of twilight dimmed the air and sur-&#xD;
rounding scenery. Madge had just awakened&#xD;
from'a refreshing sleep, and was looking around&#xD;
with a half-conscious, half-bewildered expbs-&#xD;
sion,- when the dog arose to his feet and as-&#xD;
sumed a belligerent attitude. She saw his lips&#xD;
quiver, his eyes light up, his long hair become&#xD;
erect. Madge followed the direction. of his&#xD;
threatening eyes, and beheld a spectacle cal-&#xD;
culated to inspire her with fresh alarm. This&#xD;
unwelcome apparition was no other than Brace,&#xD;
the mountaineer, who had approached by an&#xD;
open way, the long grass muffling the sound of&#xD;
his steps. His garments were torn and disor-&#xD;
dered, his head bare, save its natural covering,&#xD;
which hung matted and stained upon his fore-&#xD;
head, swarthy cheeks, and tawny neck. His&#xD;
face, where it was-not bruised and discolored,&#xD;
had a singularlyghastly sallowness. His eyes&#xD;
were glassy, and might have expressed vindic-&#xD;
tiveness, hate, or fear, or all combined. His,&#xD;
muscular body was thrown forward, and his&#xD;
weight appeared to rest upon his rifle.&#xD;
- A faint and smothered cry escaped the young&#xD;
woman's lips.-&#xD;
"I've follered - I've found ye, but you&#xD;
needn't be afeared," said the mountaineer,&#xD;
speaking slowly, and with evident exertion.&#xD;
Madge averted her eyes to shut out the gris-&#xD;
ly figure of Brace.&#xD;
"Keep the dog-still, gal, and hear what I've&#xD;
got to say."&#xD;
The voice of the mountaineer was so husky&#xD;
that she looked up.&#xD;
" It's cost me a good 'cal o' trouble to git&#xD;
here, but I'm glad to see ye afore I give lip."&#xD;
He paused, then went on:&#xD;
" I'm goin' under, gal-goin' under. The&#xD;
fall over the, cliff bruised me terrible.- I&#xD;
shouldn't been here, if I hadn't struck in the&#xD;
top of a tree ; the branches saved me from in-&#xD;
stant death, though I la stunned some time.&#xD;
Finally,:I come to and clambered down the&#xD;
tree, swearing' vengeance ag'in the Ingin; for I&#xD;
ketched a glimpse of him, as he pushed me&#xD;
over. You can't tell what I suffered fallin' !&#xD;
I thought of every act of my life afore I struck&#xD;
the tree. You've no idee, miss, how fast a&#xD;
crtur can think when he's fallin' to his death.&#xD;
The book o' my life was open, and I read it&#xD;
goin' down. But when I found myself alive,&#xD;
my wrath turned again the Blackfoot. I drag-&#xD;
ged myself out o' theValley; and then I stag-&#xD;
gered along the trail arter the traitor. When-&#xD;
ever I come to a stream, I east myself into it,&#xD;
and swallered water like a run-down buffaler&#xD;
I overtook him, 'and would had my revenge, if&#xD;
it hadn't been for you."&#xD;
-It was the fear of Carlota inspired'e,"&#xD;
said Madge.&#xD;
&#xD;
" I know her and I know you," answered&#xD;
&#xD;
Brace."&#xD;
At that moment, Madge perceived Carl6ta&#xD;
standing behind a bush- at the right of the&#xD;
mountaineer.                        ,&#xD;
" Yes, I know ye now," added Brace, in a&#xD;
low, awed voice. " It wasn't I that done it !&#xD;
'Twas Cap'n Dick that did the deed. I was&#xD;
there when they throwed ye in, but I didn't&#xD;
look at your face-I didn't cake to look #t&#xD;
your face that night. They said you was beau-&#xD;
tiful, and the men was clamorm' for ye and git-&#xD;
tin' mutinous. The cap'n, bad as he was,&#xD;
didn't want to give ye up ; he wanted ye him-&#xD;
self, and it was himself or nobody. So lo&#xD;
keep peace and preserve his authority, hetook&#xD;
Ypto Black Run on that dreadful night with&#xD;
Ialf a dozen of his most reckless fellers, and&#xD;
you know what follered. I little thoughtI&#xD;
should see ye ag'mn in the land o' the living ;&#xD;
but you wasn't to die in that way, it 'pears. I-&#xD;
shouldn't knowed ye if Carl6ta hadn't told&#xD;
me, for I wasn't familiar with your face. I've&#xD;
dreamed o' them white arms o' your beatin'&#xD;
the air more nor once, and 'twas a deed that&#xD;
has troubled me-you being' a tender gal, and-&#xD;
*e bearded men that oughter perteet sich.&#xD;
Cap'n Hendricks couldn't forgit his victim so&#xD;
easy ; he seed ye at Nick's camp, and- your&#xD;
face affected him terrible. Your boy-disguise&#xD;
couldn't pervent him from seem' a strange re-&#xD;
semblance to the pooty young woman he had&#xD;
dealt with so cruel. He thought prehaps,"&#xD;
continued Brace, reflectively, "that you'd say&#xD;
Yes, when you come to see the water running'&#xD;
swift and the men ready to do his biddin'."&#xD;
" She-she has told you this!" exclaimed&#xD;
Madge. ",She heard the tragedy of Black&#xD;
Run discussed while disguised as Indian Joe.&#xD;
She did not, she could not have consented to&#xD;
my destruction."&#xD;
"It is of you that I would speak, and not of&#xD;
her. I wanted to tell ye afore I died that I've&#xD;
alleys been sorry for being' there and seeing' that&#xD;
deed. Your forgiveness, perhaps, will'soften&#xD;
a little the pangs of perdition."a h&#xD;
"I forgive_ you freely, and as I hope 'God&#xD;
will forgive my own errors," said Madge.&#xD;
"Where is yourfirmness and courage, Bill&#xD;
Brace ?" cried Carl6ta, advancing.&#xD;
They have flowed away with my blood,&#xD;
and the savage natur' of the mountaineer&#xD;
is ebbin' with his life. I'm on the last trail,&#xD;
Carlota."&#xD;
Brace tottered as he spoke, and after ay&#xD;
ing unsteadily from side to side a moment, fell&#xD;
heavily to the earth.&#xD;
"It's a rough trail and a long," gasped the&#xD;
mountaineer.  "Where are you, Car16ta?1&#xD;
Can't you sata word to a nn who got his&#xD;
death in your sarvice P?"&#xD;
t' Poor fello* ! poor fellow !" muttered Car-&#xD;
16ta, _+&#xD;
'The trail grows dark! -Where Is the Val-&#xD;
ley?"S&#xD;
"i&#xD;
&#xD;
" He's dying!" said Carldta, solemnly.&#xD;
"How black, how chilly the Valley is 1"&#xD;
murmured the outlaw, shuddering.&#xD;
"'Tis a dark Valley, indeed I" said Carlta,&#xD;
with a nervous tremor.&#xD;
"Hark !" cried Brace, starting-up. "I hear&#xD;
the cap'n's horn and must go." The moun-&#xD;
taineer fell back, gasped, and was off the trail&#xD;
forever.&#xD;
Carl6ta stood beside the body, pale as mar-&#xD;
ble, and as motionless. The death of one who&#xD;
had been faithful in her service could not but&#xD;
affect her.&#xD;
"Look I" saidMadge, impressively. . "See&#xD;
how bad men die. Ask, yourself if you are&#xD;
not the cause of his death ; if you have not&#xD;
added to his crimes, consequently to the.heavi-&#xD;
ness of his doom."&#xD;
" Even such as he cannot die until called&#xD;
for," returned Carl6ta, " andone is not respqn-&#xD;
sible for another's deeds."&#xD;
"It is morning," continued Madge, "and to&#xD;
me this spot is fearful. I have now a faithful&#xD;
protector"-pointing to the dog--'" and by his&#xD;
guidance shall seek those who will care for&#xD;
me. Will you go,:or remain with your dead&#xD;
ruffian?"&#xD;
Carl6ta's eyes flashed with indignation.&#xD;
"Begone ! she cried, " And may I never-&#xD;
more behold your face again 1"&#xD;
"Come, good friend," said Madge, and the&#xD;
dog sprang up, eager to obey her wishes.&#xD;
"Guide me to Nick, Calamity ; take me to&#xD;
Nick."&#xD;
The animal barked and frisked around her.&#xD;
Madge.followed him a few steps, then, turning&#xD;
to Carl6ta, said, in a friendly voice':&#xD;
" Carl6ta, come with me ; and if I am fortu-&#xD;
nate enough to find friends, you shall receive&#xD;
no ill-treatment from them or me."&#xD;
Carl6ta answered with an impatient wave of&#xD;
the hand, and Madge reluctantly left her.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXVII.&#xD;

A shriek from Carlota arrested the footsteps&#xD;
of Madge. Running back a few steps, se&#xD;
saw Seven-Plumes grasping her by the arm,&#xD;
looking triumphantly into her face.  The dog&#xD;

"It is much," answered Madge, cunningly,&#xD;
"to be the wife of a great chief; but my&#xD;
thoughts and feelings flow another way. I can-&#xD;
not go with you to the banks of the Saskatch-&#xD;
ewan.' My heart would pine and be desolate,&#xD;
if I were there. Chief, I cannot dwell in your&#xD;
lodge."&#xD;
"The country is pleasant," said, Seven-&#xD;
Plumes, persuasively. "Game is abundant,&#xD;
and the prairies bear many kinds of flowers.&#xD;
Inthe summer, the sun is very bright'; and in&#xD;
the winter, the air is pure and clear, and the&#xD;
furs of the lakes and streams keep cold at a&#xD;
distance."                      .&#xD;
"Birds of a kind only mate together.&#xD;
Seven-Plumes can woo the fairest daughters of&#xD;
his nation, and they will be proud of the at-&#xD;
tentions of'so wise a chief."&#xD;
Seven-Plumes was silent a moment., His&#xD;
voice was melancholy when he spoke again.&#xD;
"Your words fill the heart of the red-man'&#xD;
with sorrow," he said; "but you gave him&#xD;
liberty, and he gives you the same. But this&#xD;
pale girl"-he pointed to Carl6ta, and his&#xD;
tones were less friendly-"-shall march to the&#xD;
hunting-grounds of the Blackfoot."'&#xD;
"Chief, use your power gently," lemon-_&#xD;
strated Madge. " Her skin is not the color of&#xD;
yours, and sehe will never be happy in your&#xD;
lodge."&#xD;
Carlota glanced earnestly at her Fair inter-&#xD;
cessor.&#xD;
"Flower of theMountains, talk not to the&#xD;
Blackfoot !, Your voice is soft, but it cannot&#xD;
prevail: the girl of the Valley goes with me.&#xD;
The way is long, and the bright sun tells&#xD;
Seven-Plumes to depart. .'There will be many&#xD;
feet on his trail before night ; but he cares not,&#xD;
for he has the cunning of the beaver."&#xD;
" Chief, I assisted you to escape-hear me&#xD;
when I -peak for the girl of the Valley,"'&#xD;
urged .Madge.&#xD;
" This palewoman no friend to you," an-&#xD;
swered Seven-Plumes. 4"Her heart very bit-&#xD;
ter, and her eyes dart fire at you. Your way&#xD;
is there"--he pointed as he spoke--"go in&#xD;
peace ."&#xD;
" The dog i the dogi1" exclaimed Carl&amp;amp;ta'&#xD;
stretching ler hand earnestly toward Ca-&#xD;
lamity.&#xD;
The chief drew his knife from his belt, and.&#xD;
tightening his grasp upon her arm, held it to&#xD;
her. breast.    .&#xD;

of Seven-Plumes eFor a moment, the ta-&#xD;
bleau was striking in the extreme. .The grim,&#xD;
threatening figure of the In dian, the irm yet&#xD;
sullen face of Carl6ta, and te earnest, appre-&#xD;
hensive, and imploring expression of Madge-&#xD;
all ,conspired to render the. scene an lncom-&#xD;

MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS.&#xD;
Madge ; and Calamity maintained his neutral&#xD;
position..&#xD;
The young woman glided forward and took&#xD;
the hand of Seven-Plumes.&#xD;
"Do not harm her, chief!" she cried ; "for&#xD;
she acts but in accordance with the nature the*&#xD;
Great Spirit has given her, when she refuses&#xD;
to accompany you. Be brave, be generous!&#xD;
and for the-good service I have rendered you,&#xD;
giveme her freedom. I ask it as a reward I"&#xD;
" The woman of the Valley hates you," re-&#xD;
plied Seven-Plumes, scanning the features of&#xD;
Madge with curiosity.&#xD;
" I care not-I care not ! I would save her&#xD;
from a fate she so much dreads. Our ways&#xD;
will be different, and she will have no power&#xD;
to do me wrong."&#xD;
The Indian looked at Carldta, then at&#xD;
Madge ; and it was evident that his purpose&#xD;
wavered.&#xD;
" You yield -- you yield ! I thank you,&#xD;
chief. Carlota, he gives you freedom !"&#xD;
Carl6ta did not speak ; her bosom was heav-&#xD;
ing with agitation, and her eyes were down-&#xD;
cast.&#xD;
" The Flower of the Mountains has asked&#xD;
much ; but the chief of the Blackfeet gives it.&#xD;
The girl of the Valley is free ; the soft voice&#xD;
has prevailed."&#xD;
There was a conflict in, the breast of the&#xD;
Indian: his better nature struggling with his'&#xD;
baser.&#xD;
"Seven-Plumes will go to his young men&#xD;
with heaviness," he added ; " but he will&#xD;
smooth his face and deceive their eyes, so that&#xD;
they shall not know the Blackfoot has been&#xD;
sad. .Go! Seven-Plumes is a warrior."&#xD;
" Thanks, brave chief! Your name shall be&#xD;
mentioned with honor among the pale-faces,"&#xD;
answered Madge, with fervor.&#xD;
Seven-Plumes turned on his heel and walked&#xD;
away.&#xD;
Carl6ta stood a moment irresolute, trem-&#xD;
bling and agitated-then cast herself into the&#xD;
arms of Madge, sobbing. Hot tears -coursed&#xD;
down her cheeks. Madge put her arms around&#xD;
her, and held her in a gentle embrace. She&#xD;
was silent at first, and allowed the pent-up&#xD;
feelings ,of the girl to exhaust their violence&#xD;
in weeping,&#xD;
She gradually dried her tears, and disen-&#xD;
gaged herself from the arms of Madge.&#xD;
" Let us go," she said, in a low voice.&#xD;
" Whither ?" Madge asked.&#xD;
" To the Valley. Let us hasten," Carldta&#xD;
answered, hurriedly..&#xD;
"No-not there-not there !" cried Madge.&#xD;
" Calm your fears. TheValley shall be to ou&#xD;
as all other places , you shall pass through it&#xD;
harmless. We must hurry to Nick Whiffiles&#xD;
he is starving. I am full of remorse !"&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVIIL&#xD;
FINALE.&#xD;
It was near the middle of the afternoon&#xD;
when Madge and Carldta neared Trapper Val-&#xD;
ley. They had made what speed they could ;&#xD;
but were necessarily faint fromlong fasting, and&#xD;
wearied by toiling over the rough and some-&#xD;
times-itiaewy      The, thought of, the sup-&#xD;
posed danger of Nick *asa sufficient incentive&#xD;
to urge them onward.&#xD;
" Trapper Valley is at the right," said Car-&#xD;
ldta.. " We will descend to it by a passage&#xD;

&#xD;
known only to Hendricks and a few of his&#xD;

Made trembled.&#xD;
"Shrink riot," added Carl6ta; "I will screen&#xD;
you from harm. Even Hendricks shall respect&#xD;
you, if we meet him, and yield to my present&#xD;
mood. Tread carefully, and grasp firmly the&#xD;
bushes as you go down; for the descent is&#xD;
steep, and perilous to careless feet."&#xD;
Carluta approached a spot where the Valley&#xD;
fell off abruptly. To a casual eye there was&#xD;
no practicable method of descending. Put-&#xD;
ping aside a mass of vines, the girl of the&#xD;
mountains unmasked a deep gulch --which,&#xD;
starting several yards from the sharp angle of&#xD;
the declivity, offered a pathway far less dan-&#xD;
gerous, though attended with sufficient diffi-&#xD;
culty to require all the strength and firmneps&#xD;
of Madge ; but imitating the example of her&#xD;
conductresi, she finally conquered the obsta-&#xD;
cles before her, 'reaching the Valley with&#xD;
bruised feet and lacerated hands.'&#xD;
" Trapper-Trace," said Carl6ta,, is they&#xD;
paused to breathe a moment, pointing to the&#xD;
east," is in that direction.. The Boiling Spring&#xD;
and the Mountain Gate are to the west." ,&#xD;
Carl6ta hurried forward and soon entered a&#xD;
wood. I~n a short time they came to a spot&#xD;
where the ground was trodden hard bythe&#xD;
fect of a horse, while  the grass was eaten to&#xD;
the earth, and the, foliage cropped closely.&#xD;
Made immediately recalled the peril of 1.ort-&#xD;
neuf. 'Carluta perceived the agitation conse-&#xD;
uent upon this discovery..aMadge turned&#xD;
her pale face on her guide with an expression&#xD;
that could not be misunderstood.&#xD;
"I knew it not! I knew it not!" said Car-&#xD;
lta, with a flush of anger. "'Twas a wanton&#xD;
act, and committed without my knowledge.&#xD;
Brace confessed it to me last night, when he&#xD;
perceived that his end was near."&#xD;
"It was cruel, cruel!" said Madge.&#xD;
" They are -wretches !" cried Carl6ta, indig-&#xD;
nantly. "Poor Portneuf! he shall have his&#xD;
daughter.    -&#xD;
The girl of the Valley walked onward, with&#xD;
strong displeasure depicted upon her counte-&#xD;
nance.   eA sudden cry from her caused Madge&#xD;
to look up. A short distance from them stood&#xD;
a grizzly bear upon his hind feet.&#xD;
"A bear ! a bear !" exclaimed Carl6ta. "Of&#xD;
all wild animals, I hold the bear in the great-&#xD;
est dread."       -1&#xD;
Madge did not retreat ; but placin? herself&#xD;
before Carl6ta, who shrank trembling from&#xD;
the beast, regarded it earnestly. She imagined&#xD;
she could see some resemblance in the' animal&#xD;
to the tame bear of the Shoshone.-&#xD;
" This creature does not appear to be fero-&#xD;
rious," she said. " I believe we have nothing&#xD;
to fear from it."&#xD;
"But he obstructs our passage-how can&#xD;
we reach Nick ?' You feared me yesterday,&#xD;
more than you seem    to fear this savage:&#xD;
beast."&#xD;

"A thousand times more I Remain quiet&#xD;
land observe the animal."&#xD;
dWoman of the 'Rock," said the bear, "the&#xD;
eyes of the Shoshon4 are glad to see you."&#xD;
" What ! does the creature talk ?"&#xD;
"Listen," replied Madge.&#xD;
"A cloud hangs over the dwelling of the&#xD;
Thunder-Spirit," resumed the bear. "It is&#xD;
black and heavy, and charged with fire and&#xD;
smoke. The lightning will art from east to&#xD;
west and from north to south. The Valley&#xD;
will be shaken, and the war-cry ofIthe She-&#xD;
shone shall roll through it."&#xD;
The bearskin sank to the ground, and the&#xD;
well-known feature of Multnomah gladdened&#xD;
the eyes of Madge. Unslinging the short rile&#xD;
that was fastened at his side,.he swung it over&#xD;
his head, and .shouted the war-whoop of his&#xD;
people. Instantly a hundred voices answered&#xD;
the. signal from rock and tree and bush:&#xD;
every covert had a cry. Then there was a&#xD;
rattling volley from rifles, carbines, and pis-&#xD;
tols.&#xD;
"My warriors are here. Igo to lead them&#xD;
against the bad pale-faces of the Valley," said&#xD;
the Shoshone.&#xD;
Multnomah bounded from the spot, and&#xD;
was soon heard cheering his, warriors to the&#xD;
fight, leaving Carluta and Madge surprised and&#xD;
bewildered.&#xD;
The combat went on at different quarters,&#xD;
but came nearer and nearer.&#xD;
" I-hear Hendricks," whispered Carluta.&#xD;
"He is raging and fighting like, a lion "&#xD;
"Heaven help the right!" urmuredMadge.&#xD;
Several bullets dropped near them. Ca-&#xD;
lamity walked, growling, around his mistress;&#xD;
and presently the dog Smuggler came bound-&#xD;
ing to her side with strong demonstrations of&#xD;
o. The mountaineers are losing ground,"&#xD;
said Carl6ta. "The conflict comes this way."&#xD;
"Let us conceal ourselves," suggested Madge.&#xD;
"For my own safety I care not ; but you I&#xD;
will shield to the extent of my power."&#xD;
The two young women were deliberating&#xD;
which way to -fly, when Hendricks, panting,&#xD;
covered with ,dust, grim  with powder and&#xD;
smoke, and bleeding from several wounds, ap-&#xD;
peared. The sight of Madge and Carldta was&#xD;
evidently unexpected. He gazed wildly frem&#xD;
one to the other.&#xD;
"Traitress!" he exclaimed, fixing his flash-&#xD;
ing eyes upon-Carldta; "you have, betrayed&#xD;
us. The Shoshone devils swarm the Valley;&#xD;
and it goes hard with our men, who are pushed&#xD;
on every side."&#xD;
In his right hand the robber'-eaptain held a&#xD;
pistol, which trembled, as if with impatience,&#xD;
in his nervous grasp.;&#xD;
" Say what you will, Richard Hendrieks-&#xD;
ou cannot wound me more. There is that&#xD;
yBch rankles deeper, here"-she laid her&#xD;
hand on her bosom-" than istol-ballor steel&#xD;
an penetrate. But spare this girl."&#xD;

PATHiAWAY ; OR, THE MOUNTAIN OUTLAWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
Hendricks turned his fierce eyes upon&#xD;
"   ho are you ?" he demanded, gruffly.&#xD;
Madge put back her hair, giving the moun-&#xD;
taineer a full view of her features.&#xD;
" Look at me, miscreant, and recall the face&#xD;
of Una, of the Old Mission!"&#xD;
The outlaw recoiled, and a sickly pallor&#xD;
overspread his visage.'&#xD;
".Do the dead come back?" he muttered.&#xD;
"Away I away !--come'not too near !"&#xD;
For an instant the shouts and the clamor of&#xD;
battle fell unheeded upon Hendrick's ear. In&#xD;
spirit he was at Black Rock, and saw the light-&#xD;
ed torches, the pale,,pleading face, and white&#xD;
arms waving in the air.&#xD;
"This is a foul lie I" he said, presently. "It&#xD;
is only a resemblance--a terrible similitude of&#xD;
wha, was, but will never again be. Begone,&#xD;
witch 1 You unnerve an arm that must must&#xD;
wave the longest ahd bloodiest in the fight."&#xD;
A olear voice rang through the wood.&#xD;
Madge's heart leaped with hope.&#xD;
Give in-give up, you white renegades,&#xD;
or I'll make a p'ison diffikilty among ye l"&#xD;
It was Nick Whiffles, surely. No one who&#xD;
had heard them could mistake those tones.&#xD;
"The spyin' scoundrel 1" 'growled Hend-&#xD;
ricks.  "But-I'll soon meet him, wounded as&#xD;
I am, and the critter-shall feel that mine is 'no&#xD;
feeble,,arm. My men give back. CowardsI,&#xD;
cowards! they miss my voice ina moment.&#xD;
At them, boys--at them !"&#xD;
The mountaineer shouted the concluding or-&#xD;
der with startling vehemence. He pointed his&#xD;
pistol at Carl6ta.&#xD;
"Father-"&#xD;
" I am not your father !" interrupted the&#xD;
outlaw, with bitter energy. " That for her who&#xD;
betrays me!"&#xD;
He discharged the weapon, and Carl6ta&#xD;
sank slowly upon the breast of Madge.&#xD;
" Oh, Carlota, Carl6ta, lie has killed you !"&#xD;
shrieked Madge. Then to the mountaineer :&#xD;
" Know, base man, that this unfortunate girl&#xD;
has been true to you and your men. We have&#xD;
but recently escaped from the captivity of&#xD;
Seven-Pluines, and were as much amazed at&#xD;
this attack as you could have been."&#xD;
Hendricka darted an inquiring look at Car-&#xD;
l6ta.&#xD;
" She speaks truly," murmured the latter,&#xD;
faintly. "I die guiltless of that with which&#xD;
you charge me."&#xD;
At that moment the outlaws were seen fly-&#xD;
ing in various directions. Hendricks called&#xD;
loudly upon- thein to return, but they were&#xD;
deaf alike to threats and appeals.'&#xD;
" You'd oughter run in that way, I allow,&#xD;
long ago, by mighty ," cried Whiffles ; and im-&#xD;
mnediatel after, the report of his rifle was&#xD;
heard. The mountaineer stood .irresolute,&#xD;
looking from' Carl6ta to Madge,- and from&#xD;
Madge to Qarl6ta. Disappointment, rage, re-&#xD;
morse, with lingering tenderness-for the girl&#xD;
Carldta, held him in suspense.&#xD;
&#xD;
The savage warriors rolled ons after the re-&#xD;
treating foe. There was an incessant explo-&#xD;
sion of fire-arms, and the whoops of the red vie.&#xD;
tors shook the forest..-&#xD;
A manly figure sprang between Hendricks&#xD;
and the girls. It was Pathaway. A faint cry&#xD;
front the dying Carl6ta attested the sincerity&#xD;
of her love, and the power that the young man&#xD;
unconsciously exerted over her.&#xD;
"'Tis he! 'tie he!" she gasped, in tones&#xD;
scarcely audible.&#xD;
The gray hunter's arm was raised--a pis-&#xD;
tol was fired. Hendricks stood motionless a&#xD;
few seconds, then fell to the ground like an&#xD;
oak, the last fibre of which has- been severed&#xD;
by the unspairing axe.,&#xD;
by Carlota," he articulated, painfully, " you&#xD;
are avenged. Dick Hendricks has fought his&#xD;
last battle with red man or white. It is all&#xD;
over-clean played out, life is. I am off for&#xD;
darkness in double quick time. A greater&#xD;
Captain than I gives the order. I have lived&#xD;
recklessly, and I'll die so. , No cant, no senti-&#xD;
mental whinin' for Dick Hendricks."&#xD;
The agony of his death-wound choked his&#xD;
utterance for an instant.&#xD;
" Carl6ta-," lie added, anon, " we shall go&#xD;
together. But :Pm sorry I raised my hand&#xD;
ag'in ye. I took  are of ye, and loved ye;&#xD;
but you was no darter o' mine. I night done&#xD;
better by ye, but the impulse to do it wasn't&#xD;
born in me. Good-good--by, gal! - Good-&#xD;
by, world, and all that's in it. 'Tis too-too&#xD;
late for sorrow-too-too late for - for-",&#xD;
The outlaw's head sank low.upon the turf, and&#xD;
he added, feebly, "for vengeance !" expressing&#xD;
his last thought with his last breath.&#xD;
Carlsta stretched out-her hand to Pathaway.&#xD;
He knelt beside her, and took it in his own.&#xD;
She gazed at -hum earnestly. A calm, almost&#xD;
happy expression lighted - up her features.&#xD;
She did not speak-she could not, but a smile&#xD;
of inexpressible meaning flitted faintly across&#xD;
her lips. Her eyes fixed, and the spirit of Oar-&#xD;
l6ta passed from its fair tenement.&#xD;
No additional light was ever thrown upon&#xD;
her parentage and history. Her grave was&#xD;
hollowed in the Valley, and Madge shed tears&#xD;
upon it-which was the only tribute paid by&#xD;
affection.&#xD;
The first thought of Porneuf and Jeanjean,&#xD;
when the outlaws fled, was to look. for Ninon.&#xD;
The search was successful, and she kvas restored&#xD;
unharmed to both father and lover. It was a&#xD;
joyful occasion for those in whom the reader&#xD;
is interested, though the melancholy fate of&#xD;
Carl6ta affected the-spirits of Madge for a long&#xD;
time.&#xD;
On the following day, a happy party set out&#xD;
for the nearest settlement.  Pathaway no&#xD;
longer called the young woman Madge, but&#xD;
Una, for there had beena full explanation of&#xD;
those matters and mysteries already under-&#xD;
stood by the reader ; and thus the young man&#xD;
recovered the woman that he had believed lost&#xD;
to him forever.&#xD;

"The p'isonest.diffikilties come to an eend&#xD;
at last," moralized Nik. "I've had my share&#xD;
of 'em,. I allow ; but alters come out right in&#xD;
the course of time. Come on, Humbug, for&#xD;
you was a humbug, little 'un, all the time you&#xD;
ywas a boy-and keep closer to uncle Nick.&#xD;
There'll be a weddin', I s'pose, down in the-&#xD;

Look out, Calamity! Don't snub Smuggler&#xD;
in that way. Well, Shoshon"-to Muitno-&#xD;
mah, who made one of the party, "notstant-&#xD;

you're rather close to my boy. Talkie ' it all&#xD;
over, I allow.- Sparrer- legs-beg your par-&#xD;
don," said Nick, apologetically, " ga, I mean,&#xD;
it rejoices my heart to see you look so bright&#xD;
and happy."&#xD;
a Made gave her hand to Nick.&#xD;
&#xD;
" It's a right small hand and a good one&#xD;
for a young man to own," said Nick, admir-&#xD;
ingly.  " Take good care on, her, Colonel.&#xD;
She's as dear to me as my rifle, and my dogs,&#xD;
and the perairies, and the air that I love.&#xD;
Keep every diffikilty from -her pooty head,&#xD;
and when you're happy in- the distant clear-&#xD;
ins', as I know you will be, sometimes think&#xD;
o' Nick Whiffiles, the old trapper of the Nor'-&#xD;
west."&#xD;
He kissed the little hand, andsighed as he&#xD;
relinquished it.&#xD;
" Are you happy, Nicholas ?" asked Madge.&#xD;
There was a slight quivering of the trap-&#xD;
r's lis.&#xD;
"Therera a little diffikilty here," he said,&#xD;
laying his finger upon ,his heart; "but it&#xD;
won't last forever. Oh Lord, no 1"&#xD;
Nick' was absent-minded and sad, a short&#xD;
time ; but brightening up, presently, told sto-&#xD;
ries of his grandfather and other members of&#xD;
the Whiffles' family, in his ugual whimsical&#xD;
manner.&#xD;
" I hope they'll be happy," said the trap-&#xD;
per; the day after the ,marriage, or rather&#xD;
double marriage, for Ninon and Jeanjean were&#xD;
united at the same time, "and that there'll&#xD;
never be any condemned little diffikilties&#xD;
atween 'em. Ishall miss the little'un wound-&#xD;
edly. And the dogs, too, for that matter, for&#xD;
Sebastian understood the natur' o' dogs and&#xD;
animiles, and was kind to 'em, as he was to&#xD;
everything else. And now, Nick Whiffles,"&#xD;
he added, addressing himself, "go back ag'in&#xD;
to the great Trappin' Grounds of the Nor'-&#xD;
west, for the air is good there and suits one&#xD;
better nor it does here. The clearin's-won't&#xD;
do for Nick Whiffies. Oh Lord, no !"&#xD;
