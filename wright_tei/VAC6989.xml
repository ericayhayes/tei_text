               <p>Along the whole southern and western coast of Florida, from the ancient Fort of
                  Saint Marks to Key West, there were no settlements, and only a few Spanish fishing
                  stations at Tampa Bay, Manitee, Boca Grande, and Sanabel, at the <hi rend="i"
                  />date when we draw the curtain of the drama which we offer to the reader, nearly
                  forty years ago.</p>
               <p>A gale was blowing, a terrific gale, from the south-east, rolling up the waves
                  from the <hi rend="i"/>Bay of Mexico—as that portion inside of the Gulf has been
                  named—and sending them on the sandy shore, where they broke in lofty walls of
                  foam. So fiercely did the tempest rage that the Spanish fishermen could not pursue
                  their avocation! They were obliged to lay their nets out upon the inner branch
                     <unclear>on</unclear> the point of Boca Grande, where their ranche was
                  established, and seek refuge in the low, palmetto-thatched huts built for their
                  shelter, which, though located in a ravine, where the wind had not full play upon
                  them, seemed hardly strong enough to withstand the gale.</p>
               <p>Here, smoking their cigarettos, they huddled, some cursing and grumbling at the
                  weather; others uttering a prayer, now and then, to San Antonio—<emph>all</emph>
                  discontented and out of sorts. Suddenly, however, the booming of cannonry—and that
                  close at hand—startled all of them to their feet, and with one idea they rushed
                  simultaneously out to see what could be off that coast in such a storm, and why
                  the cannon were fired. On reaching the elevated point that bounds to the south the
                  narrow entrance to the bay, which extends far back into the swamps and wilds of
                  the country, they saw a large schooner, foretopsail rig, evidently armed heavily
                  and with a full crew, standing in toward the coast, under a fearful press of
                  canvas. And only about a mile nearer, but so close to the shore that the persons
                  of those on board of her could be plainly seen, was a small but beautiful
                  schooner-boat—no more than five or six tons burthen, and but partially decked
                  over, yet she rode the sea like a duck, and seemed to cut the water as a bird
                  cleaves the air. Upon her deck were three persons—a man who stood at the helm, a
                  lovely female, who clung to the weather shroud a few feet before him, and by the
                  hand she held a little girl, whose glossy ringlets fluttered out like penons on
                  the gale.</p>
               <p>Against this boat and its helpless crew, to the wonder of the Spaniards, the
                  cannonade of the large, black-sided schooner was directed. To their surprise, the
                  more, because the schooner showed no flag, and did not seem, by her looks, to be
                  either a Guarda Costa or a man-of-war.</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Es una Pirata</foreign>—it is a pirate"—they muttered,
                  and, crossing themselves, they prayed earnestly for the escape of "<foreign
                     xml:lang="SPA">El galetta chica</foreign>"—the little schooner—and some of the
                  more earnest of them ran down to the point, and by beckonings and signals,
                  endeavored to direct the fugitives how to run into the narrow channel, which,
                  having once entered, would place them in safety for a time. The man at the helm
                  saw them, seemed to understand, and, keeping his craft steady for the shore, soon
                  perceived how to steer to make the entrance. Meantime the shot from the pursuing
                  vessel were ploughing up the water all around him. Twice had his small sails been
                  perforated, time after time had the spray from the hissing shot dashed over him,
                  yet no spar was touched—nor he, or the woman, or child hurt, and they now were
                  very close to the shore.</p>
               <p>Though they trembled for it, yet the Spaniards hoped for that bold steersman's
                  safety, for he seemed to bear a charmed life—Dead came so near and yet
                  refrained.</p>
               <p>He was now upon the outer range of breakers which broke across the bar—nobly his
                  lovely boat rose upon them—reeling and staggering before the gale, in she sped<pb
                     n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6989-00000003"/> through the yeast of foam; a moment more
                  and she was in smooth water. A glad hurrah rose from the lips of the fishermen,
                  but its echoes were hushed in the fearful burst of the schooner's whole broadside,
                  as she rounded to, scarce a half mile off, and threw a shower of grape and
                  cannister at the hapless fugitives. With a shudder, they turned to see its
                  effects. They groaned and beat their breasts as they saw the lovely woman, who had
                  held the child by the hand, fall to the deck, and saw the man, who, letting go the
                  helm, permitted his boat to luff up under the lee of the head-land, spring forward
                  and raise her in his arms, while great torrents of blood gushed out from her
                  breast and ran in crimson currents over her white dress.</p>
               <p>They manned several of their fishing canoes and hurried off, in spite of the
                  driving gale, to offer their assistance. They found the man, a young and
                  noble-looking person, kneeling upon the deck and trying to staunch the wound, but
                  all in vain, while the terrified child clung to the corse and moaned—"Mamma,
                  mamma, speak to Ona!"</p>
               <p>It was a pitiful scene. They made their rude but well-meant offers of aid, and
                  then, for the first time, he seemed to be aware that they were alongside of his
                  boat, for, with the fierceness of a maniac, he half raised her form from the deck,
                  and while his eyes glared and his long hair blew out straight on the gale, he
                  shouted—</p>
               <p>"Off! off! She is murdered! she is murdered!"</p>
               <p>Then he laid the body down, trimmed his tattered sails, sprung to the helm, and,
                  before another minute had passed, his boat was flying like a gull before the
                  storm, far up the bay amid the thousands of islands which lay between the sea
                  coast and the "Big Cypress."</p>
               <p>A wild mystery to them was in all this. Never had they seen a more beautiful lady.
                  She was tall, raven-haired, lovely in feature, and perfect in form. And costly
                  jewels glittered on her fingers, bracelets of gold clasped her wrists, and also
                  were on her fair round arms above the elbows. By this they deemed her Spanish.</p>
               <p>As soon as the boat had luffed in out of sight of the schooner, the latter
                  commenced making signals for a pilot, having shortened sail and hove to as near
                  the shore as she dared. But, had it been possible for them to go out to her, there
                  was not one of those honest fishermen who would have helped to do further wrong to
                  the wretched fugitive, whoever he might be, by aiding to bring the schooner in
                  that she might renew the pursuit.</p>
               <p>Gun after gun did the schooner fire, and then, with men at her mast-head, she
                  stood close in as if to reconnoiter the bar, to see if <unclear>it were</unclear>
                  passable: and though it was, and for a vessel of larger size than her, for the sea
                  broke in four fathoms water upon it, and the men on shore could by signs have
                  easily guided her across, they would not do it. The sight which they had witnessed
                  had sickened their hearts, and more than one prayer was uttered that night, that
                  the pirate, for such they deemed her, would sink before the morning dawned
                  again.</p>
               <p>But, during the night, the tempest slackened, and when morning came the wind had
                  almost died away. Then they saw the low black hull of the schooner rising and
                  falling with the swell of the sea, as she lay at anchor about a mile from
                  shore—her tall spars, with the canvas close-furled, standing in bold outline
                  between them and a cloudless sky. As soon as it was fairly light, a boat was
                  lowered from the vessel, manned with an armed crew. They pulled in upon and over
                  the bar, taking soundings and bearings as they went, and soon found that their
                  schooner could, without difficulty, make the anchorage inside. They returned to
                  her, and, in a short time, she was got under way, run in and brought to an anchor
                  under the same lee where the stranger's boat had luffed up she day before, and
                  within musket shot of the huts of the fishermen.</p>
               <p>The latter were much alarmed, but they had nothing to be robbed of except a few
                  thousand pounds of dried fish and their nets and canoes, so they did not fly, but
                  with many prayers to their patron saints, awaited the result of whatever might
                  come.</p>
               <p>In a little while an armed boat landed from the vessel, and one who seemed to be
                  her commander sprung to the shore. He was richly dressed, strongly framed,
                  thoroughly armed, and his features would not have been uncomely if passion had not
                  evidently made its throne within his heart. His look was that of one seeking for a
                  victim with the ardor of a Malay, wishing for bloody vengeance for some wrong or
                  fancied injury. His age was probably not more than thirty—his light hair and
                  complexion spoke of Anglo-Saxon blood. With him was a lean, sallow-faced
                  individual, dressed in black, evidently ten or fifteen years older, whose small,
                  snake-like eyes, thin lips narrow forehead, and close-shaved face made him look,
                  what he <emph>surely</emph> was, a villain; <emph>probably</emph> a kind of Judas
                  or Arnold, ready to <emph>be</emph> one for any one, if money was in question.</p>
               <p>The first comer, in an imperious tone, demanded of the fishermen why they did not
                  answer his signal for a pilot. He was replied to by the eldest of the party, a
                  gray-haired Minorean, one Pablo Canovas, who, among his companions, had the
                  reputation of fearing neither man nor the devil.</p>
               <p>"We didn't understand your signal," said he, boldly; "and, if we had, we had no
                  beat which could live in the surf on the bar yesterday!"</p>
               <p>"Yet you could signalize the villain who crossed by your directions, when we were
                     <unclear>sure</unclear> of his capture!"</p>
               <p>"That was not half so bad as <emph>your</emph> murdering his poor wife!" said the
                  old Spaniard, bitterly.</p>
               <p>"His wife? Did <emph>he</emph> say she was his <emph>wife</emph>, my dear fellow?"
                  said the individual in black, quickly catching at the expression.</p>
               <p>"Ask the insolent dog no questions, Counsellor; <emph>I know</emph> that she was
                  married to him; that's <emph>enough!</emph>" said the other impatiently.</p>
               <p>"Then Captain Febiger, we <emph>must</emph> have the child, or all will fall
                  through, unless we can prove its death. My dear fellow, the child was unharmed,
                  was it not?"</p>
               <p>"When I know whether I'm talking to the devil or not, I'll answer!" said old
                  Pablo, gruffly.</p>
               <p>"Come—I like <emph>that!</emph>" said he who had been addressed as Captain
                  Febiger, smiling grimly on Pablo. "He is a <emph>lawyer</emph>, and they're

               <p>"If your heart had been as good as your eyes, she, too, would have been spared!"
                  said Pablo.</p>
               <p>"You think so, eh? Well, now, I have a better heart than you think for, or I
                  should cut off both your ears for your insolence; but I like your spirit—it has a
                  spice of the devil in it, like my own. If you'll come aboard the schooner—the "<hi

               <p>"Keep your grog to drown the recollection of bad deeds in!"</p>
               <p>"Well, well, the offer was kindly meant, take it as you will. Do you know anything
                  about the bay up which the fellow went?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Nothing!</emph>" said Pablo.</p>
               <p>"How far does it extend before the main is reached?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>I don't know!</emph>" replied the Spaniard.</p>
               <p>"Your men, here?"</p>
               <p>"Know no more than I do!" continued Pablo.</p>
               <p>"What the devil <emph>do</emph> you know?" cried Febiger, beginning to get angry
                  and show his natural ferocity again.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Nothing</emph>, when it suits us; a good deal, when we want to!"</p>
               <p>The strange captain's hand was on the hilt of his sword, when the gentleman in
                  black urged him to pursue the fugitive and child, who were, probably, fast getting
                  beyond pursuit, urging, for some reason, that the person of the latter must, at
                  all events, be secured, even if the death of the other was not accomplished.
                  Curbing his anger as best he could, the captain of the schooner returned to his
                  boat and went on board of his vessel. In a short time, four boats, full manned and
                  armed, put off from the schooner, rowing in the direction which the stranger had
                  taken on the day before.</p>
               <p>"The holy saints keep <emph>him</emph> and the child from their devilish
                  clutches," muttered Pablo, as he saw them go off. "They mean <emph>it</emph> no
                  good if they do find it, and they seem bent on <emph>his</emph> life! I'd like to
                  know why. One thing is certain, if ever I can aid him any, I will?"</p>
               <p>The old man now set his men to work, for he was the <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >Padrone</foreign> or master of the fishing ranche, though the proprietors
                  lived in Havana, where market was found for the <unclear>fish</unclear> when

               <p>In a large old stone mansion on that part of Manhattan Island known as Jones'
                  Woods—and <emph>now</emph> destined to be the Central Park, or expected to be
                  during the present century—or rather in a spacious room thereof, fronting on the
                  East river, bright glimpses of which could be seen through the trees which stood
                  very thick about the building—an elderly man strode to an fro, nervously.</p>
               <p>His thin hair was a kind of dirty yellow, as if time had whitened it with soiled
                  hands; his face was wrinkled, but apparently more with anxiety than with age; and
                  his small gray eyes, in their quick searching glances, looked as if they sought
                  either for a place to hide something in, or for some secret spot from which to
                  abstract something. His fingers worked nervously, as he pursued his hurried walk,
                  and he would mutter <hi rend="i"/>words that exhibited excitement, though his
                  parchment-colored face showed no more signs of it, than a chunk of river ice
                  covered with saw-dust.</p>
               <p>The room, despite his own shabby appearance, was magnificently fitted up. Rich
                  carpets were on the floor, the furniture very costly for that day, and choice
                  paintings hung upon the walls.</p>
               <p>The promenade of the person thus partially described, was broken in upon by a
                  colored servant, who said:</p>
               <p>"Massa Febiger, dere's a gemplemen down in de 'ception room dat wants to see you.
                  His name am Amasa Queer."</p>
               <p>"The horrid old bore! Did you tell him I was in?"</p>
               <p>"No, sah, but Antigony, de porter, did!"</p>
               <p>"The devil take the infernal nigger! Show the gentleman up; perhaps he wants to
                  see me about stocks—he dabbles in them as far as his paltry thousands will let him
                  go!"</p>
               <p>In a few moments Mr. Amasa Queer made his appearance.</p>
               <p>Queer in name, his looks surely did not belie his cognomen, nor, judging from
                  that, his nature. He looked to be about fifty, perhaps five years ahead of that.
                  He wore a snuff-brown coat, brushed very clean—it had been brushed so often that
                  it was thread-bare, but then it was dustless. His vest was elaborate of embroidery
                  and over it, a large gold guard chain was displayed, and to his fob chain, which
                  dangled from below, a pound or less of old seals, keys, and "charms" were
                  suspended. His head was kept erect by one of those stiff, old-fashioned stocks
                  which aid a trebly starched collar in putting some people to the torture. His
                  "checked" pantaloons were remarkable for their <hi rend="i"/>fit. They tightly
                  fitted a very aldermanic abdomen—they tightly fitted a pair of legs which seemed
                  all too slender to support such a ponderous upper-half. He were gloves—cotton
                  gloves, black at that—and carried an ivory headed cane, which, like himself, was
                  very large at the top and very small below. His air was jaunty as that of a
                  sand-piper on the sea-beach; yet he seemed to try to make it appear a business
                  one.</p>
               <p>"Ah, my <emph>dear</emph> friend Febiger, how <emph>do</emph> you do? I haven't
                  seen you on 'Change for so long, I began to fear you'd cut <emph>us Wall street
                     men</emph> altogether; so I thought I'd drop up and see you!" cried Mr. Queer,
                  advancing with a rapid step and an extended hand.</p>
               <p>"Delighted to see you, (oh, what a whopper!) take a seat, Mr. Queer. John, some
                  wine! You must feel fatigued with your exercise—sit down, sir!" said Mr. Febiger,
                  as cordially as if the "old bore" had been his brother.</p>
               <p>"And how's the son, your heir and hopeful—eh, Mr. Febiger?"</p>
               <p>"At sea, sir. He prefers an active life afloat to a lazy one on shore."</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes—and your lovely ward—"</p>
               <p>"Off on a visit to her southern relations!" said Mr. Febiger, quickly, in a tone
                  that implied a dislike of such questioning, and the color began to flush the
                  parchment of his face also. But Queer did not seem to notice this, for he
                  continued:</p>
               <p>"Off south, eh? Why, I didn't know that—"</p>
               <p>"United States stocks have gone down again, have they not?" almost thundered Mr.
                  Febiger, who, for some reason or other, didn't like the track Queer was on.</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes. Are you a heavy loser? Got much on hand, eh?" replied Queer, rather at
                  a loss to account for the sudden "flashing up" of his old friend.</p>
               <p>"More than I want!" replied the latter, testily.</p>
               <p>"I'll take 'em off your hands at eighty and a third. Strange stocks! When I first
                  went on 'Change they were up to a hundred and twelve and fifteen! How much have
                  you on hand?"</p>
               <p>"About a hundred thousand," said Febiger, as coolly as if he was telling the
                  truth.</p>
               <p>"<emph>What?</emph> The figures rather overtop my limits for the present—for the
                     <emph>present</emph>, Mr. Febiger; but, when I get in some outstanding matters,
                  I'll call upon you—depend upon it, I'll call upon you. We Wall street men have to
                  lend so much to outsiders, you see—securities good, but yet we never can keep
                     a<unclear>thousand</unclear> in hand—it is wanted all the time—and, as long as
                  it brings in <emph>cent for cent</emph>, why 'tis better to keep it moving!"</p>
               <p>"Some wine," said Mr. Febiger, "some old sherry, brought home by my son!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, capital!" and Queer in an instant forgot stocks and Wall street as he sipped
                  the amber-colored juice, holding it up to the light occasionally, with the air of
                  a connoisseur. "Excellent! I have drank wine with Governor Clinton, said to be
                  sixty years old, but <emph>twasn't</emph> a sample to this. I'll try another
                  glass, if you please. Ah, thank you. It runs like a sound of joy along the
                  channels of an old man's blood, making him feel young again. Ah, friend Febiger,
                  you are a happy dog—a happy dog. Too rich to count your money, a smart, active
                  son, and such a nice niece for a ward! I suppose the young people will make a
                  match of it, eh?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Sir!</emph>" thundered Febiger, and his face grew black as a
                  storm-cloud—"sir, I never discuss <emph>family</emph> matters, except
                     <emph>with</emph> my family!"</p>
               <p>"Really, my dear sir, a thousand pardons, I meant no offence—I only
                  thought—I—"</p>
               <p>"No matter, Mr. Queer, no matter. It is a point that I am very sensitive on. Your
                  apology is quite sufficient. Take another glass of wine, sir; I see you have
                  spilled yours!" said Mr. Febiger, resuming his self-command.</p>
               <p>"So I have—thank you—so I have," said Queer, extending his glass. "I was as much
                  startled at your sudden anger as I would have been if I'd heard my heaviest debtor
                  had gone by the board; but I was in error. Your health, sir, and a hope that the
                  'United States' will rise in the market. It's all owing to Nick Biddle, old
                  Jaudon, and foreign speculations that it don't. It's to their interest to keep it
                  down and get it out of market, all into their own hands, to the injury of us
                  smaller dealers, who are <emph>honest</emph>, if we don't cut so deep into
                  financial matters as they do!"</p>
               <p>After another glass of wine, and a few more remarks, Mr. Queer departed, having
                  taken care to keep off forbidden ground after this caution.</p>
               <p>"Cursed fool!" muttered Febiger, after he had politely bowed Queer out. "What set
                  him to asking such questions? I believe he was a friend of her father's, come to
                  think of it—yes, he made that an excuse for calling to see her the first time that
                  he ever darkened my door. Well, he has crossed the threshold, and he never will
                  again!"</p>
               <p>The gentleman rung the bell violently. The servant appeared.</p>
               <p>"John, do you caution Antigonius, and remember yourself, that whenever that man
                  comes here again, I am not at home, whether I am <emph>in</emph> or not."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sah!" and the black withdrew.</p>
               <p>Again Mr. Febiger renewed his nervous promenade, seeming to be studying out some
                  project or other, for he occasionally spoke his thoughts aloud. It seemed that
                  there was something in Chancery or in the Orphan's Court which he wished to get
                  at, but obstacles were in the way which he could not remove as easily as he
                  desired. Such, at least, would be inferred from the <unclear>disjointed</unclear>
                  sentences which fell from his lips. <unclear>But</unclear> we will leave him for
                  the present, and <unclear>w</unclear> our way to the south—dear, flowery south,
                  land of beauty and love.</p>

               <p>Swiftly over the land-looked waters of that lovely bay—rapidly threading the
                  channels that opened between islands clad in Nature's gaudiest hue—the little
                  schooner flew with her tattered sails—a stern, tearless man at the helm, the
                  little child now nestling close to his feet and looking up to him; for it, poor
                  thing, could get no answer from its mother, though oft it had called upon her. Her
                  pale lips were silent now, and the soul-light gone from her dark eyes forever!</p>
               <p>The boat sailed on, and within two hours from the time he had so rudely repulsed
                  the kind-hearted fishermen, the stranger was close into a dark range of heavy
                  forest, which he knew must be the main land. The sight of a small smoke, such as
                  would rise from a campfire, induced him to steer for it, and as he neared the
                  land, he saw that a narrow and sluggish creek seemed to enter the bay at that
                  point. Near it, a dozen or more Indians stood, who gazed wonderingly at the boat,
                  for such visits to their forest fastnesses had not been made often, though
                  sometimes Spanish traders, in small piraguas, visited the islands and points along
                  the coast, to barter calicoes, and powder, and lead, for skins, and dried meat,
                  and fish.</p>
               <p>The stranger boldly ran his schooner up into the creek, and after running a little
                  way, so that she could not be readily seen from the lake, he luffed her up,
                  lowered his sails, and ran her bow upon the shore, where, grounding, she remained
                  fast and safe as if she had been at anchor.</p>
               <p>Then, with folded arms, and his little child by his knees, he stood upon the deck
                  by the side of his dead wife, and waited the approach of the savages, who were
                  slowly advancing from their camp. Of more than ordinary height, with a muscular
                  and well-proportioned figure, richly dressed, and armed with pistols and a heavy
                  poniard in his belt, and a serviceable sword by his side—his eye of blue, bright
                  and flashing, and no sign of fear upon his bearded face—he was one well calculated
                  to strike Indians with a sense of his superiority.</p>
               <p>They came on, and soon stood upon a bank within a few feet of him. They looked
                  first at him and the beautiful child; but when they saw the corse of the lovely
                  woman lying in a pool of blood upon the deck, they uttered exclamations of horror
                  in their own language, and looked upon him in distrust. He saw this, and his first
                  thought was an explanation, which might dispel the thought that he was guilty of
                  an act so base as to slay a woman.</p>
               <p>"Do any of you speak Spanish?" he asked, in that language.</p>
               <p>"Yes!" said a tall and haughty warrior, who seemed superior to the rest. "I am
                  Chikika, a war-chief. Who are you?"</p>
               <p>"A <emph>man</emph>—pursued by the murderers of my wife!" he said, pointing to the
                  body on the deck. "And your smoke will soon guide them here—<emph>then</emph> you
                  may see whether I am a warrior or not."</p>
               <p>The chief gave one of his men an order, and in a few moments the fire was
                  extinguished.</p>
               <p>"Come to the shore—I would talk with you alone, and hear your story. If your heart
                  is white, we are your friends, and your enemies must not seek you while you are
                  with us, or we will take their scalps," said the chief.</p>
               <p>The stranger bade his little child stay with mamma, and at once and fearlessly
                  stepped on shore, and retired apart from the other Indians with Chikika. To have
                  shown any distrust at such a moment, would have ruined his cause. After some ten
                  or fifteen minutes' conversation, the two returned to the boat, and Chikika,
                  addressing his warriors, said:</p>
               <p>"Brothers!—the pale face has seen sorrow and been wronged, but his heart is white.
                  His wife sleeps in death before him. She has been murdered by his enemies, and he
                  will keep the hatchet sharp till she is avenged. He wants to dwell with us and be
                  one of us. To live with us and die with us—to raise the little papoose till she
                  looks as her mother did. He is a great Medicine! Our king Micanopee is very
                  sick—the pale-face Medicine can cure him! He is rich. He has powder, and lead, and
                  guns, and knives, and hatchets, and money to buy more with!"</p>
               <p>A word of approval went from lip to lip. The chief continued:</p>
               <p>"I adopt him for my brother! Will you look upon him as a brother and strike hands
                  as friends?"</p>
               <p>An unqualified assent was given by every warrior present.</p>
               <p>"It is well. You are my brother, and I name you Arpiaka—the 'White Medicine,'"
                  continued the chief.</p>
               <p>The <emph>ceremony</emph> of adoption into the tribe was to be deferred until the
                  party reached the village of Micanopee, the head chief, but to all intents and
                  purposes the stranger was now adopted, and had those by his side who would fight
                  for him to the last gasp.</p>
               <p>Leaving a couple of men to act as sentinels and watch the bay, Chikika gave orders
                  for the other Indians to get into their canoes, make fast to the schooner and tow
                  her up the river four or five miles, to a higher country, where they could encamp
                  more safely from observation, and where the poor wife of <hi rend="i"/>Arpiaka,
                  for by that name, and that alone, must he be known at present, could be buried.
                  The chief went on board of the little vessel with his adopted brother.</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>It was sunset when they laid her in a grave which they had dug beneath a tall
                  magnolia—a tree whose broad-extending branches would afford shelter to the birds
                  which came to sing the requiem of her, whose spirit, pure as the spotless flowers
                  which filled the air with fragrance, had fled from earth, and left
                     <emph>him</emph> alone to whither in his grief. It was a solemn burial. Wrapped
                  in a robe which he said she had worn at her bridal, they laid her gently down,
                  amid sweet branches and many flowers, and with such they covered her, so that no
                  earth should touch her. And then they raised a mount above her, and he, whose
                  grief so deep was tearless, carved a name upon the tree, as he sighed, "Lost, lost
                  forever!" That name was—"IONE."</p>
               <p>More costly pall and coffin may have sepulchred a queen—yet never one, I ween, so
                  fitting for the pure and lovely. Many a long train of mourners may have followed a
                  great one of earth to the tomb, but none more sorrowful or respectful than that
                  dusky train of warriors. It was pitiful to see poor little Ona, scarce two years
                  old, look upon them when they laid her mother down amid the flowers, and to hear
                  her ask, "Mamma sleep?" Yes, the sleep that on earth was to know no awaking!</p>
               <p>The evening shadows came and drew the vail of night over the bosom of the earth.
                  But the bright-eyed stars looked down through it, and sent their bright glances in
                  amid the flowers and upon the dancing waters. The Indians withdrew to their camp,
                  and Arpiaka went with them to a sweet arbor which they had framed for him among
                  some wild orange trees. They had covered it with the broad leaves of the palmetto,
                  so that neither dew nor rain could fall on him or Ona, and they had brought soft
                  grasses from the river side and made his carpet and his bed, and over all spread
                  soft skins and blankets of feathers. And they had seen that he loved flowers when
                  he laid them on his dead wife's breast, and flowers they had gathered and twined
                  in with the orange blossoms all around him. He kissed his weary child and laid her
                  down to sleep, and then he left her, for he knew no harm would come to her—left
                  her to go and grieve upon the grave of his heart's idol, whom he could see no
                  more.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <p>Morning dawned upon the Indian camp. The stars had hid their faces before the
                  glory of the sun, and went to rest while he was abroad. The warriors rose and
                  bathed in the crystal waters, and builded their fires anew for the morning meal.
                  The little child woke in her arbor, for birds were singing overhead and upon every
                  hand, and the scene was strange to her. And her wail was heard, for she found no
                  mamma there to hear her lisp her morning thanks to the Great Preserver, nor was
                  her father by her side to still her new-born terror.</p>
               <p>Chikika sought and found his brother. But oh, how changed! No wonder that the red
                  men deemed it a miracle! His hair, a glossy brown, the night before, had changed
                  to a snowy white. Oh, tell me not that tears speak <emph>grief</emph>—they emblem
                  joy as well. One night of sorrow—one night of recurrence to past joys, lost
                  forever—one night of thought, realizing how great the loss, had left its record on
                  his head for life.</p>
               <p>When Ona saw her father. The was frightened, for at first she did not know him.
                  But his voice, bearing kind words of love in through the portals of her spotless
                  heart, told her who he was and all trembling, she nestled in his bosom, like a
                  dove which fears the hawk.</p>
               <p>"My brother must not grieve—his heart must be strong! The spirit of his bride
                  looks down from the happy land, and smiles upon him and his child! Be a
                     <emph>man!</emph> Let women weep—warriors should not!" said Chikika.</p>
               <p>"It is true!" replied Arpiaka. He kissed his child, and thenceforward he smiled,
                  nor let the grief-cloud darken his face, though it lay condensed within his
                  heart.</p>
               <p>The morning meal was prepared, more varied and profuse than could have been found
                  in the haunts of civilization, for the waters had yielded oysters, fish, and
                  turtle: the forest its turkeys and other game, beside venison; and such hunters
                  were not of the kind to go hungry when earth, air, and water teemed with all which
                  the appetite could crave. And they had bread made from the white flour of the
                  powdered <hi rend="i"/>Coomptee,* and fruit—oranges, guavas, bananas, and cocoa
                  plums. Grapes, too, in rich clusters hung all around. Lemons and limes to
                  acidulate their fish. Salt, fresh-made from the ocean. Peppers, tiny, but sharp,
                  all at hand, with which to season their food.</p>
               <p>For the Indian, what a paradise was such a land! Why should the pale face rob him
                  of it, and send him, the son of the sunny south, to freeze on the bleak prairies
                  of the west—why, oh, God of justice, why? Echo only answers—WHY?</p>
               <p>But a little after the breakfast had been dispatched, one of the sentinels, or
                  scouts, whom Chikika had left upon the border of the bay, came up the creek in his
                  canoe, and said that four boats of pale faces were upon the water, searching among
                  the islands and along the shore.</p>
               <p>"The enemies of my brother—they seek his life?" asked Chikika.</p>
               <p>"Yes—the murderers of my wife—they seek my blood—they would rob me of my child!"
                  replied Arpiaka.</p>
               <p>"They had better put their hand in the nest of the hooded cobra than seek my
                  brother among the Seminoles!" cried Chikika "We will go half way to meet
                  them!"</p>
               <p>At his word, his warriors instantly resumed their arms. Arpiaka now stepped to his
                  boat, entered its small cabin, and brought out a splendid double barreled ride,
                  which he gave to Chikika, and then to each of the other warriors he gave a new
                  rifle, telling them to give their old ones to such of their brothers as had none,
                  when they got back to their great village where Micanopee lay. And to each he gave
                  a sharp and glittering knife. And from a keg he filled their horns with powder,
                  and, giving them lead, bade them hasten to run bullets with which to slay his
                  enemies. And they hastened to do it. Meantime, he loaded a rifle similar to that
                  which he had given to his adopted brother, and prepared for action if his foes
                  should come upon him. His boat, which contained many stores of value—for he had
                  been in search of a home upon this very shore when pursued by his enemies—was
                  drawn close up under some overhanging bushes, and her masts taken down, so that a
                  boat could pass close by her and yet the crew make no discovery.</p>
               <p>The sun was well up when they were ready; in truth, it lacked no more than an hour
                  or two of noon, when, leaving Ona under charge of a faithful sentinel in the
                  arbor, Arpiaka embarked with the rest in canoes, and steered down toward the bay.
                  The utmost silence was observed, for though Chikika offered to send for, and could
                  soon have had, five hundred warriors at hand, Arpiaka would not let him, and their
                  numbers were far inferior to those reported by the scout as being in the bay. It
                  was decided not to show themselves to the whites, but if the latter found the
                  creek and entered it, then to attack them from the banks in ambuscade where
                  Chikika felt sure that, even with his small force, he could destroy them.</p>
               <p>Soon the party landed near the mouth of the creek, and hiding their canoes, made
                  preparations for a <hi rend="i"/>reconnoisance. Skulking low among the dwarf
                  palmettoes which lined the pebbly shore, they could see the schooner's boats
                  scouring about from island to island, and sweeping along the main in their vain
                  search after Arpiaka and his child. At times the whites came so near that their
                  shouts and curses could be plainly heard, and several times they landed, but they
                  could find no traces of those for whom they sought; and at last, when the sun
                  began to sink low in the west, and redden, as if flushed and weary with the day's
                  travel, they were seen slowly and sullenly rowing back toward their own
                  vessel.</p>
               <p>Chikika, whose blood had been hot for battle, eager to avenge Arpiaka's wrongs,
                  now returned with his band to remain at their camp that night, and to prepare for
                  an early start to Micanopee's village.</p>
               <p>And little Ona's cry of joy when she nestled once more upon her father's breast,
                  was clear and glad as the song of a bird hailing the warm breath of spring. She
                  had missed him in his absence</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <p>When the boats of the <hi rend="i"/>Belladonna returned from their fruitless
                  search, three of them went directly to the vessel, but the one in which the
                  captain and lawyer sat, rowed toward the shore. The sun was just sinking out of
                  sight, and the fishermen, having ceased labor for the day, stood smoking in front
                  of their cabins, while one or two prepared their evening meal.</p>
               <p>"Why do you smile, fellow?" asked Febiger fiercely, seeing honest Pablo Canovas
                  standing, with a pleased look, among the rest.</p>
               <p>"To see you come back empty-handed—to see that the vultures have sought their prey
                  in vain!" replied the old Spaniard.</p>
               <p>"Beware, insolent dog; I am not as easy in my humor as I was this morning!"</p>
               <p>"I care not for thy humor—I am not thy slave!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>No?</emph> You may be less than a slave if you do not keep a civil tongue
                  in your head! But I am not here to bandy words with you or any of your gang—but to
                  make you an offer! You all saw the man and child who escaped my pursuit yesterday.
                  To-day I have sought for them in vain—"</p>
               <p>"And will to-morrow, next day, next year, <emph>forever</emph>, I hope!" cried
                  Pablo.</p>
               <p>"Silence, dog, or I'll strike your head from your shoulders!" cried Febiger,
                  doubly angered at the words and interruption. Then he continued:</p>
               <p>"I will give ten thousand dollars for that child alive—ten thousand dollars in
                  hard, yellow gold, and will add five thousand for him who slays the father—his
                  scalp will be the proof! He probably will come back here after I have gone with my
                  vessel. Some of you know the Senor Rafael de Ribera, of Havana?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—he deals with pirates, smugglers, and cut-throats, and <emph>must</emph> be a
                  friend of yours!" said Pablo.</p>
               <p>"He will pay the money for the child and scalp if I am not there. You need only
                  give the name of Marcus Febiger, and it will be sufficient!" continued the
                  captain. "Now, my men, there is a chance to earn a small fortune easier than
                  hauling rotten fish ashore!"</p>
               <p>"An easier way of earning eternal <emph>damnation!</emph>" cried Pablo, bitterly.
                  "Accursed be the hand which touches blood-money! Accursed be he who would steal a
                  child from its parent! May his own blood be shed and his children die in
                  beggary!"</p>
               <p>As the old fisherman said this, his head bared to the evening breeze, and his
                  hands and eyes raised toward heaven, he looked like some venerable prophet
                  invoking the strength of heaven to aid the helpless and the innocent.</p>
               <p>"By the hand that made me, you've gone far enough, old man!" shouted the brutal
                  Febiger. "Take <emph>that</emph> for your reward!" and he raised his heavy cutlas,
                  and with terrific force it crushed down upon the old man's head, half severing the
                  arm which he threw up to defend it.</p>
               <p>The fishermen sprung to their cabins for what arms they had, but Febiger, backed
                  by his armed crew, retreated in safety to the boat, and soon was beyond the reach
                  of the enraged companions of poor Pablo. The latter was<pb n="12-13"
                     xml:id="VAC6989-00000007"/> carried to his cabin, and it was found, fearfully
                  wounded as he was, that life was still in him, though he who struck the blow, as
                  well as those who saw it done, believed him to be slain out right. He so far
                  recovered as to give directions how to staunch the bleeding, for he had served in
                  the armies of <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Espana vieja</foreign>, and knew
                  considerable of surgery.</p>
               <p>As soon as the moon rose, the schooner was got under way and stood out to sea,
                  followed by the curses of the honest fishermen, whose quiet had been thus
                  unwarrantably broken in upon. They had, with <emph>one</emph> exception, listened
                  with scorn to the offers of Febiger, and would have begged or starved before they
                  would have earned money by such a deed.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>One</emph> exception. There was a <emph>Judas</emph> in the company of
                  Jesus—an <emph>Arnold</emph> among the heroes of our Revolution, and in that
                  little band of fishermen there was one <emph>Pedro Picaro</emph>, who, for money,
                  would have sold a father to death, or a sister to shame, though he wore so smooth
                  a face and had so soft a tongue, that none could know him except such as pierced,
                  with discriminating eyes, the outer shell which hid his true nature from
                  superficial observation.</p>
               <p>Pedro Picaro had heard the offer, and recorded it in his heart—on its black
                  surface, in crimson letters, it was writ, and he determined to earn that money if
                  he could. He was young, strong, had an <emph>assassin's</emph> courage, was
                  fertile to invent, and prompt to execute. He was not much liked by his comrades,
                  for they had found him treacherous and insincere, but he was the most useful hand
                  about the ranche—equally good at mending a broken net or a leaky canoe, and withal
                  a capital hunter, as their larder, well stored with the flesh of wild hogs, wild
                  cattle, venison, turkeys, etc., bore witness to. It is singular, yet it is a fact,
                  that pork or meat of any kind is a luxury to fishermen, who, though they have the
                  choicest of the finny tribe before them, seldom touch fish when they have other
                  food.</p>
               <p>But we will leave the wounded Pablo to the care of his companions, hoping that he
                  may recover—and we will leave Pedro Picaro to concoct his plans of villany, while
                  we go somewhere else in search of matters of interest.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <p>On the next morning their wardrobes, much improved by some gaudy cloths and
                  ornaments which Arpiaka had given them, the Indians prepared to return to the
                  village of their head chief, or king, Micanopee, who was lying so sick that it was
                  thought no conjuration could save him, or medicine, culled from the forest, give
                  relief. As on the day before, the canoes united in a string, and took Arpiaka's
                  little schooner in tow, she being sharp and light of draught, sliding along very
                  easily after their strong and well-plied paddles. Chikika, who, with a delicacy
                  which did him honor, had caused some of his men to remove the blood stains from
                  the schooner's deck, remained on board with Arpiaka.</p>
               <p>For many miles they kept steadily on, the creek at times spreading out in large
                  lagoons, then narrowing between high banks, and leaving them bare space to
                  pass—now crooking and forking off into different channels, which would have
                  utterly confused a stranger—then, again, so shortly turning to the right or left,
                  that any one twenty feet from the turn would believe he had got to the end of the
                  creek, and feel inclined to go back if he were unacquainted; for the water was so
                  still and slugguish, that its course could scarcely be observed. Up this creek,
                  only pausing once, about noonday, to take a little food, they steadily paddled,
                  until almost night, when, after passing through a dense and gloomy swamp of
                  cypress, they suddenly emerged into a small, but very lovely crescent-shaped lake,
                  and then Arpiaka saw what might well have been termed an Indian <hi rend="i"
                  />city, rather than a village. The whole opposite bank of the half-moon-shaped
                  lake was covered with neat houses, made of stripped poles, and thatched with
                  palmetto; and in their airy lightness, or light airiness, admirably adapted to
                  that delicious climate, where no frost comes to blight the bud or wilt the
                  flower.</p>
               <p>To the right and left, far as the eye could reach, were fields in which grew corn,
                  melons, tobacco, and fruits of every kind; and cattle and horses, guarded by small
                  boys, could be seen grazing in amongst them.</p>
               <p>As the boats approached the shore, hundreds of the bright-skinned inhabitants, of
                  all ages and both sexes, gathered down upon the beach; for Chikika, proud of his
                  adopted brother and his wealth, had raised the masts of the schooner before she
                  entered the lake, and Arpiaka, to please him, had decked her out with flags, of
                  which he had several on board. And the <emph>more</emph> to please him, he had
                  mounted a small brass swivel, which was fired, with a louder report probably than
                  had ever echoed over those waters before.</p>
               <p>The schooner soon was moored to the land, and Chikika, leaving a guard upon the
                  schooner to keep the curious off, led his pale-faced brother on shore, and, amid
                  the silent and wondering multitude, took him to his own lodge, which was next in
                  size and elegance to that of the sick king, and had several apartments, in which
                  were found his wives, five in number, one of whom was of pure Spanish blood. She
                  was the mother of his eldest boy and his favorite, and it was through her that he
                  had become so proficient in the Spanish language. She had met him at a fishing
                     <foreign xml:lang="SPA">ranche</foreign>, loved him, and fled to the forest,
                  and she did not regret her choice, for he was very kind to her.</p>
               <p>To this woman <hi rend="i"/>Maraquita, Arpiaka confided his little one for a time,
                  while he and Chikika should visit the sick king, who was reported, by his
                  attendants and the sub-chiefs to be much worse, and wildly raving. Arpiaka first
                  sent Chikika back to the schooner for his well-stocked medicine chest, from which
                  he selected several articles which he thought might be useful, for he was a man of
                  education, and a finished chemist, and well acquainted with the nature and use of
                  medicine and its effects.</p>
               <p>Before Arpiaka reached the grand lodge of the king with the chief, they could
                  hear, even at some distance, his wild ravings, which were none lessened by the
                  drumming of the chief conjurer or physician, who sat before the lodge, beating his
                  drum to drive off the Evil Spirit which afflicted his master. A word from Arpiaka
                  to Chikika and the infernal din was stopped.</p>
               <p>They passed in to the inner apartment, which had been closed up with mats, and was
                  as hot as an oven, and there found the old chief literally raving like a maniac,
                  if, indeed, he was not one. He was held down by four stout warriors, else he would
                  have ran raving from his lodge.</p>
               <p>As Arpiaka, with his large, glistening eye fixed upon him, advanced toward the
                  invalid, his pale face, long white hair, and tall figure giving him an air of
                  majestic dignity, the king suddenly ceased his ravings, and the limbs which, with
                  straining muscles, had striven to free themselves from the grasp of the strong
                  men, sunk peacefully down upon the couch. Arpiaka never let his gaze leave the eye
                  of the sick man; but he took hold of one of his hands, and with his right hand
                  commenced gently soothing the throbbing nerves of the sick man's head. Then he
                  spoke to Chikika,<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6989-00000008"/> and bade him tear away
                  the close matting from the sides of the lodge, and to let the cool air come in
                  upon the patient, through the network of poles and vines outside. This was done;
                  but he kept the hand of his patient, never moved his gaze, and continued passing
                  his hand gently over his brow and temples. For a time, though without speaking,
                  the sick king returned his gaze; but in a little while his eyes began to droop,
                  and soon he slept as quiet as a babe upon its mother's bosom.</p>
               <p>"He comes from the Great Spirit, this medicine-man," murmured the warriors who had
                  seen this done; "he can bring the dead to life!"</p>
               <p>Arpiaka now took a little phial from his pocket, and poured it in a cup of
                  water.</p>
               <p>"When he awakes, let Mieanopee drink this, and to-morrow he will be well! Make no
                  noise to disturb his slumber, and let the free air come to him!" said he.</p>
               <p>The warrior attendants, who looked upon him almost as a god, promised obedience,
                  and with a still, but proud step, Arpiaka departed; for he felt that already he
                  had done a thing which would give him a monarch's power among that people,
                  although he had only availed himself of Mesmer's soothing art, which, with his
                  powerful mental and physical organization, and strong <emph>will,</emph> he was
                  easily enabled to do.</p>
               <p>He now returned with the wondering, but proud Chikika, to his lodge, where a
                  supper, great in quantity and rich in quality, awaited them; for the chief's
                  Spanish wife had trained the others, and they were excellent cooks. A room was
                  prepared for Arpiaka in the chief's lodge that night; on the morrow a lodge of
                  grand proportions was to be built for his separate use.</p>
               <p>The morrow came, bright and cloudless. A gentle breeze dipped its lips in the cool
                  lake, and then came to kiss the brows of the villagers, ere it passed away amid
                  the magnolias, the oaks, and the pines beyond. At an early hour Arpiaka and
                  Chikika went to visit the king, and hundreds gathered in silence near; for they
                  had heard that the pale face had promised the cure of their loved chief.</p>
               <p>The king had woke but once since Arpiaka had left, and then they had given him the
                  prescribed medicine, and he had sunk back to slumber again. He now slept; and when
                  Arpiaka felt his pulse, he found it calm and healthful, but weak, and both his
                  hands and brow moist, and free from fever. He therefore sent Chikika to his boat
                  for a bottle of old wine; and after pouring out a cup of this, and adding a tonic
                  powder he woke the king, and placed it to his lips. The latter, without a
                  question, drank it off, and it seemed almost in an instant to throw new life into
                  his limbs, long weakened and unnerved by sickness. He arose, unaided, to a sitting
                  position, and looking at his strange physician in wonder, asked who and what he
                  was.</p>
               <p>Chikika now told Mieanopee all of Arpiaka's story, doubtless garnishing it well
                  from his own fancy, and related to the king what the pale-face had done for him
                  the night before. The king, who spoke good English—for he had been much with the
                  whites, and had visited the city of Washington several times to try—vain
                  thought!—to get justice for wrongs done to his tribe, addressed Arpiaka, and
                  said:</p>
               <p>"You are a great man, and the Spirit of Good is in you! Your heart is white. You
                  are a brother to Chikika, but you are a <emph>son</emph> to me. You have saved my
                  life. I was dead, but you have called me back from the spirit world! I will reward
                  you. Twelve of my slaves are yours, to make your fields and take care of the
                  horses and cattle which I will give you. You shall stay with us, and be our
                  'Medicine,' and give me sense to govern my people, for you know all things. The
                  Great Spirit speaks through your tongue, and works through your hands. I am
                  strong; let me go out with you, and show my people what you have done!"</p>
               <p>The king, through whose veins the old wine was now coursing, leaned on Arpiaka's
                  arm, and walked with a firm step out from his lodge, where he could be seen by the
                  assembled thousands of his subjects.</p>
               <p>Loud and long was the shout which greeted his appearance, and louder and longer
                  still one which followed, when, after a hush, he raised his voice, and cried—</p>
               <p>"My children, behold my savior! I adopt him as my son—love and honor him as such!"
                  And the king, by advice of Arpiaka, returned to his lodge, where the latter
                  prescribed his diet for the day, so ordering that the return of strength should be
                  gradual and permanent. And Micanopee gave orders for the immediate erection of a
                  lodge, even more spacious than his own, for Arpiaka, bidding workmen to obey every
                  order of the latter in its arrangements. And he gave other orders to Chikika
                  regarding slaves, cattle, horses, fields, etc., which need not be mentioned here.
                  Every preparation was to be hurried, for the formal ceremony of adopting the
                  "Great Medicine" into the tribe. But of that another chapter will speak; this one
                  must close to give us a chance to look elsewhere.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <p>In the back room of a large stone house on the <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Calle
                     Obra-de-pia</foreign>, in Havana, sat about as villanous a man, in looks, as
                  one could well hatch up in his imagination, if he wanted to picture a scoundrel of
                  the darkest dye, who, without an attribute of common humanity, could be engaged in
                  any phase of crime known to men. He was a Spaniard, evidently, but seemed to have
                  some negro blood in his veins, for his lips were thick, his hair crispy, and his
                  eyes red and fiery. A deep sear, extending from the left eye-brow across the
                  bridge of his nose, down to his jaw-bone, gave his otherwise hideous face an ugly
                  aspect, and seemed a record of some fray, where his life had run a narrow risk.
                  Diamonds glittered on his finger and in his shirt-bosom, and chains and jewelry
                  were hung about him with vulgar profusion. He was seated before a huge iron
                  closet, which was so set in the wall that its door, when closed, seemed to be a
                  part of the ceiling. Upon strong shelves in this closet, piles of doubloons could
                  be seen, and bags of gold and silver lay heaped up on the floor. Books of account,
                  too, were stowed there, and one of these he was examining at the time I introduce
                  him.</p>
               <p>"Hang these government sharks, <emph>I</emph> say!" he muttered. "I have paid the
                  Governor-General three thousand doubloons for landing only six cargoes of negroes!
                  By San Diego, it eats too big a hole in my profits. I'll try a run or two without
                  a permit, and see if the risk won't pay!"</p>
               <p>The sound of a distant bell caused the Spaniard to throw his book quickly into the
                  closet, and to shove the door to. It closed with a spring, and no one could see a
                  sign that a door was there when he turned from it.</p>
               <p>"It is the warning that someone comes!" he muttered—"who can it be? 'I expected no
                  visitor to-night—but we'll soon see!"</p>
               <p>And, lighting a cigar, he cast himself down, lazily, upon a lounge, as if he had
                  been taking a <foreign xml:lang="SPA">siesta</foreign>.</p>
               <p>Directly, a servant entered and announced "the Senor, El Captano Febiger," and
                  close upon his heels followed the commander of the "Belladonna."</p>
               <p>"Ah, friend Ribera!" he cried, "have I caught you napping for once?"</p>
               <p>"Not so fast," said Don Rafael de Ribera, rising, and offering his coarse, but
                  glittering hand, "I was only <emph>resting</emph> to let my dinner digest! But
                  what's the news—where are you from—are you in your saucy clipper yet?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied the other, taking a seat, and lighting a cigar from that extended
                  by Ribera "I've been on a wild-goose chase—but on nothing that would pay you or
                  interest <emph>you</emph> to know! In it, for the first time in my life, when I
                  undertook a thing, I have failed! But my special business with you to-night, is to
                  direct, that if a man should at any time bring you a little girl for me, that you
                  take her, and guard her as you would a casket of diamonds, until I can hear from
                  you, and come for her. Pay the man that brings her ten thousand dollars, and if
                  with her, he brings a human scalp of long, brown hair, give him five thousand more
                  and then, if he never should leave the city with his money and my secret, I shall
                  not be sorry—<emph>you</emph> understand!"</p>
               <p>"Perfectly!" said Ribera; "it shall be attended to! When did you see your
                  father?"</p>
               <p>"For a few moments only, about three weeks ago!" replied Febiger. "I had just come
                  in with a small cargo, without a manifest, when I got news that started me off in
                  a hurry. I nearly accomplished my object, but failed. Remember, you are to keep
                  the strictest guard over the child, if she is brought. A fortune of two millions
                  of dollars, and more, may be her's if she gets into other hands!"</p>
               <p>"You can trust me, Captain Febiger. At this moment I have over a million of
                  dollars of your father's invested, and entirely under my control, and
                     <emph>he</emph> has no fears of me!"</p>
               <p>"I am aware of that, Ribera; I did not doubt you, but only spoke by way of
                  caution. But I'm as thirsty as a Cape Cod girl after a long sermon—got anything to
                  wet down with, handy?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, what shall it be—wine, or something heavier?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Heavier,</emph> by all means! Wine will do for women and milk-sops—give
                  brandy to me!"</p>
               <p>"Touch that bell on the table, if you please!"</p>
               <p>Febiger did so, and a servant appeared, to whom the necessary orders were
                  given.</p>
               <p>"I've got a live curiosity aboard the Belladonna, Ribera!" continued the
                  American.</p>
               <p>"Ah, what is it, a baboon or an alligator?"</p>
               <p>"What a hand you are at guessing, Ribera! You beat the Yankee's—it's a cross
                  between them, as near as I can make out, with a little mixture of the shark—it's a
                     <emph>New York lawyer!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"The <emph>devil!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"No, not the devil, but one of <unclear>his adjutants</unclear>!"</p>
               <p>"How came he on board of your vessel?"</p>
               <p>"He is in my father's <unclear>employ,</unclear> and as <emph>he</emph> thought
                  some compromise might possibly be made, if I overhauled the parties after whom I
                  was sent, the fellow was put a <unclear/>
                  <pb n="16-17 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6989-00000009"/> ready to draw up the
                  papers! He's as full of law as a rotten biscuit is of worms!"</p>
               <p>The brandy came in just in season to wash down that comparison. After taking a
                  couple of stiff horns, Febiger arose to go.</p>
               <p>"When do you leave?" asked Ribera.</p>
               <p>"This <emph>very</emph> night—a few doubloons have done the business for me with
                  the captain of the port, and I suppose there will be a cargo of prime cigars
                  aboard, when I get back, which pay no export duty, and I'm sure they'll get into
                  New York free!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, captain, you're a hard nut to crack!"</p>
               <p>"And them that crack me will get bitter meat for their pains!" said the young
                  captain, and then shaking hands with Ribera, he bade him adieu.</p>
               <p>"Remember me to your father," cried the latter, as Febiger departed—"tell him I'll
                  take care of every vessel that he fits out for the 'Coast,' if he posts me in
                  time. The last was a sickly season here, and <hi rend="i"/>Guinea pigs are wanted
                  on the plantations, and will fetch a good, round price!"</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye!" cried Febiger, and he was gone.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <p>The sun rose, and not a cloud lay in its pathway athwart the sky, on the morning
                  of the day when Arpiaka was to be <emph>formally</emph> adopted into the tribe
                  among whom he had chosen a home. He was installed in his new house, which, fitted
                  with furniture, books, musical instruments, arms, etc., brought from his little
                  schooner, was very unique, yet Christian and comfortable, if the second term is
                  admissible. With servants, too, who, having runaway from Georgia and Alabama, had
                  been put to easier labor by Micanopee, and who understood his wants, as well as
                  his orders. Arpiaka had every attention that he could desire. Chikika had
                  permitted one of his own daughters, who spoke Spanish well, to become a nurse for
                  little Ona, who seemed already, in the care which was bestowed upon her, to forget
                  the dear mamma, who slept beneath the towering magnolia.</p>
               <p>Arpiaka rose early, and bade his slaves hasten to prepare breakfast, for he
                  expected Chikika to assist him in dressing and painting, for he was now to discard
                  the dress which he had worn, and dress as his brothers did.</p>
               <p>Chikika came early, and his countenance indicated that there was some trouble in
                  his breast Arpiaka noticed this, and inquired why a cloud had settled upon his
                  brother's face.</p>
               <p>"I am sad, for a bird has whispered evil tidings to me!" said the chief. "My
                  brother, who is very dear to me, has an enemy among my people, and one who is very
                  powerful!"</p>
               <p>"Who is he, and what have I done to make an enemy?" asked Arpiaka.</p>
               <p>"It is Tustenuggle Hadjo. He was the king's conjuror and sense-bearer until you
                  same, and he is angry that you, by your power and good have supplanted him. He has
                  power, because the people believe he is a great conjuror!"</p>
               <p>"Let not my brother grieve," said Arpiaka; "this day I will prove Tustenuggle a
                  fool before all the people, and he will hide his head and go away!"</p>
               <p>"Then Chikika's heart will rejoice," said the chieftain, and the cloud on his face
                  vanished, for he believed that the lips of his brother could utter no
                  falsehood.</p>
               <p>The sun had traveled one-third of its day's journey; and proud was the display on
                  the grand parade, or "ball-ground," in the centre of Micanopee's village. Every
                  warrior, and all the women and children, were dressed in the gayest attire which
                  they could muster. The warriors were painted, their scalp-locks trimmed, and their
                  weapons in hand, as if they were about to go to battle. Upon a throne, or
                  platform, raised near his lodge, sat Micanopee, a lofty coronet of many-colored
                  feathers upon his head, and a magnificent mantle of flaming feathers, of a rich
                  scarlet hue, upon his form. Around him clustered his sub-chiefs and warriors, who,
                  by their deeds in battle, had won a right to stand next to their sovereign.</p>
               <p>At a sign from Micanopee, the drums of a band of warriors commenced beating a slow
                  and monotonous march; and at the same moment, accompanied by Chikika, Arpiaka
                  stepped proudly forth from his lodge.</p>
               <p>Oh, how much more noble he looked in the dress of the forest than he had done in
                  the European garb! His well-turned limbs, his tall, straight figure, so well
                  developed, now had full play. The fringed hunting shirt, descending to the knee,
                  lay easy across his swelling breast, and the close-fitting moccasin gave a light
                  spring to his step, which he never<figure>
                     <head>"OFF, OFF—SHE IS MURDERED—SHE IS MURDERED!"</head>
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6989-00000010"/> had felt before. Above his lofty brow a
                  coronet of rich purple feathers rose, contrasting well with his snow-white hair.
                  His face had been darkened, and it also made a deep contrast. His dress was rich,
                  and over it he wore an embroidered belt, in which a bright hilted bowie-knife, and
                  a large and handsomely mounted pistol, were placed. He also carried a rifle, twin
                  to that which Chikika so proudly carried by his side.</p>
               <p>As the two reached the centre of the square, without saying a word, Chikika turned
                  and left Arpiaka, and at the same moment a band of painted warriors bounded forth,
                  uttering hideous yells, firing their guns over his head, and then they closed in a
                  circle about him, shaking their glittering knives and hatchets in his face, and
                  menacing him with instant destruction.</p>
               <p>With a cool, undaunted air, he rested the butt of his rifle on the ground, and
                  folding his arms upon his breast, regarded their threatening gestures with a
                  smile. They redoubled their efforts to terrify him, but it was in vain, and at
                  last they retired. Arpiaka was now about to advance, when a hideous looking
                  creature bounded toward him. It had on horns and great glaring eyes, and from its
                  red mouth smoke and sparks of fire came forth. Its body was scaled like an
                  alligator, and long claws were on its four feet. It was a hideous looking monster,
                  indeed! It dashed upon Arpiaka, and rearing up, with its paws on his breast, it
                  puffed the fire and smoke directly in his face.</p>
               <p>With a strong and well-directed buffet, Arpiaka not only knocked the monster down,
                  but knocked the false head entirely off, revealing the face of the conjuror
                  Tustenuggle Hadjo, now convulsed with pain and rage.</p>
               <p>"Your life shall pay for this, accursed pale face!" muttered the discomfitted
                  conjuror, picking up his false head, which, with its fire apparatus, lay smoking
                  on the ground, and hastily retreating to his lodge, while the welkin rung with
                  shouts of applause for Arpiaka. He had borne his tests well.</p>
               <p>Chikika now rejoined him, and led him to the throne of Micanopee. The old chief
                  arose and said:</p>
               <p>"Arpiaka, son of my old age, thy home is in my bosom! We adopt you as a son and a
                  brother. Your enemies are our enemies—your friends are our friends! From among our
                  maidens choose your wives; from all that we have take what you want. You are now a
                  Seminole, and may the Great Spirit bless you!"</p>
               <p>He descended and threw a richly-worked belt over the neck and shoulder of his
                  adopted son, and the ceremony was over.</p>
               <p>Arpiaka thanked him, and then requested permission to show some conjurations or
                  magic deeds, which would prove his wisdom and power. To this the king gladly
                  consented, and the mass crowded as close to the throne as possible.</p>
               <p>One of Arpiaka's negroes now advanced with a salver, upon which stood a plain,
                  black bottle and a crystal goblet.</p>
               <p>"Let Tustenuggle Hadjo, the <emph>great</emph> 'conjuror,' be sent for. I would
                  test his power and his honesty," said Arpiaka.</p>
               <p>It was done, and, trembling with rage, Tustenuggle came.</p>
               <p>"Will the king be pleased to taste my wine?" asked Arpiaka, and he poured out a
                  full goblet of wine, clear as amber, and rich as ever was pressed from the
                  grape.</p>
               <p>"It is delicious," said Micanopee, and his eyes sparkled as he drained the glass,
                  for he felt it tingle through every vein.</p>
               <p>"Let Tustenuggle drink his royal master's health!" said Arpiaka, refilling the
                  goblet.</p>
               <p>Not clear, but dark as blood came forth the draught, and the conjuror took but one
                  swallow, when, spitting it out with disgust, he cried: "You have given me gall to
                  drink!"</p>
               <p>"No!" cried Arpiaka, in a tone of thunder; "your heart is black, and your lips
                  have turned the wine to gall! It was from the same bottle from which I served the
                  king. Another glass, slave!"</p>
               <p>Dashing the first goblet to pieces, the <emph>true</emph> magician filled another
                  with the same sparkling wine which had so pleased the king, then passed it to
                  Chikika and the other warriors. It went from lip to lip until it was drained.</p>
               <p>"Now," cried he, "once more I will test the heart of Tustenuggle Hadjo. I pour out
                  wine to him; if it turns to gall, the Great Spirit knows why 'tis done!"</p>
               <p>He raised the same bottle and filled the glass, then handed it to Micanopee to
                  taste.</p>
               <p>"It is <emph>gall!</emph>—his heart is black!" said the king, and he handed the
                  goblet to his warriors. They tasted the bitter draught, and their looks were dark
                  toward the now mystified and frightened conjuror, who tried to get away from his
                  position.</p>
               <p>"Let the conjuror stay! He is a <emph>man</emph>—so am I. Let him see if he can
                  kill me, as he has vowed to do in his own lodge, among his women!" cried
                  Arpiaka.</p>
               <p>The conjuror started and trembled yet the more, for he had indeed so threatened,
                  but he deemed that no one knew it but his women, whom he had cautioned not to
                  speak.</p>
               <p>"See here!" continued Arpiaka—"here is my pistol—it is not loaded—there is powder
                  and ball; load it, and then, taking aim at my heart, standing from me only one
                  spears length, fire! If you kill me, it is well—I will be in your way no longer;
                  if you do not, then cease to be my enemy!"</p>
               <p>Chikika and Micanopee both remonstrated, for they thought that he would lose his
                  life. But Arpiaka told them that the Great Spirit<pb n="20-21"
                     xml:id="VAC6989-00000011"/> would preserve him from all harm, and handed
                  Tustenuggle the pistol and powder. Then marking the ball, and showing it to the
                  king and his warriors, he handed it to the eager conjuror, who seemed to feel
                  certain now of removing his rival.</p>
               <p>When the pistol was loaded, Arpiaka tore open the front of his hunting shirt, and
                  bidding the conjuror take good aim, told him to fire. While the crowd kept
                  death-like silence, and those around the throne hardly drew a breath, the conjuror
                  raised the deadly weapon—raised it slowly till his aim was on that naked breast,
                  then fired!</p>
               <p>Arpiaka did not move. A smile was on his face, and he raised his hand and took the
                  marked bullet from between his white teeth, and handed it to the king, remarking,
                  as he did so, that the conjuror was "a bad marksman—he shot too high!"</p>
               <p>With a howl of baffled rage and fear, Tustenuggle Hadjo fled away, not only from
                  the crowd, but from the village, while the wondering king and the warriors
                  regarded Arpiaka with an awe and reverence, such as they would have rendered to a
                  god. And yet he had only practiced two very common tricks in the art of
                  legerdemain, many more of which he was acquainted with, and stood ready to use if
                  necessity required it.</p>
               <p>From that time on, the Great Medicine had enough to do. All the sick prayed for
                  his aid, and as he was really skillful, and they had <emph>faith</emph>, which is
                  the physician's best aid, many and wonderful were the cures which he effected. Not
                  half as much power did the king possess as he, for the people believed that he
                  could not die, and they feared as well as loved him. In everything the king asked
                  his counsel, and no wish of his was disregarded. One thing the king wondered at:
                  though the loveliest maidens in the tribe would have given half their lives to
                  become his wives, he would not marry.</p>
               <p>"The breast whereon <hi rend="i"/>Ione has pillowed her head, can never support
                  another," said he, one day, when Chikika offered him his own daughter, the nurse
                  of Ona, a lovely girl of seventeen.</p>
               <p>Of one thing Arpiaka was glad. He had frightened away the dark and subtle
                  conjuror—for Tustenuggle had never been seen since the day he fled away from the
                  village. It was thought that he had gone to the creeks in the north, or the
                  wandering Mickasookics, who hung about the swamps to the west of Onithlacoochee.
                  Wherever he was, Arpiaka felt certain that the terror infused by his magic
                  experiments was with him, and that he would be chary how he attempted his
                  life.</p>
               <p>There is nothing which so affects the courage of an Indian as a belief that you
                  possess a supernatural power. They are spiritual believers in the fullest sense,
                  and have been for ages—long before such a thing was thought of in civilized
                  circles</p>

                  <unclear>friend Marcus</unclear>—or <hi rend="i"/>Captain Febiger, I should
                  say—how do you do? I'm dreadful glad to see you; as glad as if one of my debtors
                  had anticipated date in the payment of a note. Come into the Tontine and test the
                  brandy!" cried our old acquaintance, Amasa Queer, as he met the young captain of
                  the Belladonna in Wall street, just eight days after the interview which the
                  latter had with Ribera in Havana.</p>
               <p>"How are you, Mr. Queer? Up to your eyes in stocks, I suppose, as usual?" replied
                  Febiger, accepting the invitation to the Tontine tacitly, by turning his steps
                  toward that time-honored <emph>spiritual</emph> resort.</p>
               <p>"Touching them slightly, <emph>slightly!</emph>" said Mr. Queer, in a tone meant
                  to imply that he was dealing very heavily. "What is the news, my dear boy—just in,
                  eh?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, just arrived from a trip to the southward!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes; I saw your father the other day, and he said you was at sea! What will
                  it be, captain?"</p>
               <p>They had now arrived at the bar.</p>
               <p>"Brandy!" said Febiger. "I never drink anything stronger!"</p>
               <p>"Ha—ha, I shouldn't think you could, especially as they keep nothing here but
                  'fourth proof,' right out of the Custom House!"</p>
               <p>"It <emph>is</emph> tolerable!" said the young captain, filling a glass two-thirds
                  full, and "tossing it off" as if it had been water.</p>
               <p>Mr. Queer contented himself with a glass of Hudson ale; this he softened with a
                  bite of cracker and cheese, but keeping his tongue going whenever his jaws were
                  unoccupied—a common custom of his everywhere, and on all occasions.</p>
               <p>"I had quite a joke with your father the other day; ha, ha, quite a joke, friend
                  Marcus!"</p>
               <p>"Indeed; what was it?" asked Febiger, proceeding to light a cigar.</p>
               <p>"Well, you see, I knew your pretty cousin, Ione, slightly. I knew her poor father
                  well, went to school with him, and when he brought his pretty wife home from
                  Spain, I was one of the first to give him joy! Well, you see, I knew pretty much
                  about his affairs when he and his wife died, and I was a' thinking what a snug
                  little fortune your cousin had; and as you was the only heir to your father's
                  wealth—and that's more than he could count in a week—what a good thing 'twould be
                  for you two to hitch on matrimonially and double the heap. Good joke, eh? Why,
                  what on earth is the matter with you, Captain; are you <emph>sick?</emph> You are
                  pale as that marble there!"</p>
               <p>"No, sir; no!" said Febiger, controlling with difficulty the fearful passion which
                  was rising in his bosom, and calling for another glass of brandy.</p>
               <p>"So, Mr. Amasa Queer," said he, more calm, after he had swallowed the brandy, "you
                  said all this to my father?"</p>
               <p>"That, or something to that effect!" replied Queer.</p>
               <p>"How did he take it, Mr. Queer?"</p>
               <p>"Why, would you believe it, old friends as we've been, meeting on 'change more or
                  less for twenty or thirty years back, he got as mad as a hornet! But I know
                     <emph>you</emph> wouldn't; an old man's jokes don't mean anything, you
                  know!"</p>
               <p>"Do you know what <emph>I</emph> should have done if I had been at home, Mr.
                  Queer?" asked Febiger, coolly.</p>
               <p>"No, my dear sir; pray, what would you have done—cracked a fresh bottle of old
                  wine, eh, my lad?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir! I would have told you that you was an impertinent old puppy, and made
                  one of the niggers kick you out of doors!" said Febiger, and he laid a dollar down
                  on the counter to pay for the liquor, and walked off, leaving Mr. Queer in a state
                  of stupefied amazement.</p>
               <p>"Well, what the deuce <emph>is</emph> the matter—acts just as bad as his father
                  did, when I spoke of <emph>her</emph>. There must be something wrong, but I can't
                  see into it. But I <emph>will;</emph> may I never buy another note, if I don't!
                  Here, barkeeper, I'll take the rest of the change for that dollar; the young man
                  is a friend of mine, went off in a hurry, and forgot it. I'll return it to
                  him!"</p>
               <p>The barkeeper, who, attending to some other gentlemen, had not heard the words
                  used by Febiger, handed Queer the money without hesitation.</p>
               <p>"Well, I've lost nothing and made something by the operation, and that's more than
                  I ever did out of a Febiger before!" muttered Queer, as he pocketed the change and
                  walked off. "Hang me," he continued, "if I can see what sets them afire so quick,
                  if I bring in poor Ione's name. Maybe they've quarreled with her, and that's why
                  she's gone to see her 'southern relations.' Who <emph>they</emph> are is another
                  mystery, for I never heard her father tell about any; and he wouldn't keep a
                  secret from <emph>me</emph>, I know. Well, one thing is certain, old Febiger is a
                  hog, and his son is a pig; that's as sure as I'm an honest man! The fellow would
                  order me—<emph>me</emph>, Amasa Queer, broker, etc., etc., and a gentleman to
                  boot, out of his house; have his blacks <emph>kick</emph> me out! Whew! I'd like
                  to see him do it. I'd like to see him do it!"</p>
               <p>And Mr. Queer walked up Wall-street, looking as if he owned half of it.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <p>In the same room where we first saw him, in the stone mansion near the East river,
                  sat Mr. Febiger the elder. He was seated near the window, and before him on a
                  chair was a small brass-bound box, or portable deck. From this he had taken a
                  paper, which he was reading, and the perusal of which seemed to affect him
                  considerably, for, as he read it line by line, he made his comments upon it.</p>
               <p>"I wish it was not registered!" he muttered, "then alteration would be easy, and I
                  could bring the whole property under my control!"</p>
               <p>He was interrupted in his cogitations by the entrance of a servant.</p>
               <p>"What now, John—why do you disturb me, when I have given orders to be left
                  alone?"</p>
               <p>"Beg pardon, sah, but dat Massa Blacking, de lawyer, dat went away wid Massa
                  Marcus, is down stairs, and say he <emph>must</emph> see you!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, has <emph>he</emph> returned? Send him up at once!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sah!"</p>
               <p>The servant retired, and in a minute or two the "gentleman in black," whose
                  acquaintance we have already made, as connected with the "Belladonna" in her late
                  cruise, entered the room, his hat in hand, bowing obsequiously as he advanced,
                  with a sickly, cringing smile on his sallow face.</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Blacking, what news? Did my son overtake the fugitives?"</p>
               <p>"Nearly, sir—nearly!" replied the counsellor.</p>
               <p>"Nearly—if nearly, why not <emph>quite?</emph> Has your expedition resulted in
                  nothing?"</p>
               <p>"Rather more, sir, rather more—your niece and ward is dead!"</p>
               <p>"And where is her child?" said Mr. Febiger, not evincing the slightest emotion on
                  receiving the news.</p>
               <p>"Escaped with its father, and gone beyond our reach."</p>
               <p>"Fire and furies! We are just as bad off as when the mother lived. By this will,
                  if she marries, her child or children succeed to the property. Blacking, you'r a
                  fool—a scoundrel, sir! I send you to do work, and you only half do it! Didn't I
                  pick you up out of the gutter; and make a man of you? The only case you'd ever
                  had, when I found you, was for a pig thief—you got him off by trickery, and took
                  half the stolen pigs for your fee! Is not that so? Why are you so unfaithful to
                  your benefactor—to me, sir, to <emph>me!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Sir—sir—you do me injustice. Hear me first, then condemn me! I was not in command
                  of the expedition—your <emph>son</emph> was, and he used all diligence, and had it
                  not been for a violent storm, and extraordinary good luck on the part of the
                  fugitives, we should have secured them, and effected your object!"</p>
               <p>"My niece is dead, you say—how did she die?"</p>
               <p>"She was killed by a grape shot, when we were trying to cripple their boat,
                  sir!"</p>
               <p>"Why, in the name of Satan didn't you kill father and child, and bring proof that
                  they were dead—then, as next of kin, all of this property would be mine!"</p>
               <p>"Fortune favored them; they had crossed a bar which we could not cross, and,
                  getting behind a point of land, escaped up into the country. We followed and
                  searched, but in vain!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Febiger paced to and fro, angrily for a few moments, and then pausing abruptly
                  asked:</p>
               <p>"Where is my son?"</p>
               <p>"He went to enter his vessel at the Custom House."</p>
               <p>"Did he bring home any cargo?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, a few hogsheads of sugar and molasses on his manifest, and five hundred
                  thousand cigars that were <emph>not</emph> there."</p>
               <p>"From the Habana?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; but here he comes, and can make his own report!"</p>
               <p>"Very well, Blacking, you can retire to your room—I shall want you by-and-bye.
                  When I do, I will send for you!"</p>
               <p>The lawyer, or slave—either term would be applicable to him, it would seem—bowed
                  in meek humility, and retired, as the younger Febiger entered. The latter
                  carelessly threw himself down on a <choice>
                     <sic>safa</sic>
                     <corr>sofa</corr>
                  </choice>, while his father, who remained standing, said:</p>
               <p>"Well, you've made a failure, Master Marcus!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, partially so, father!" replied the junior, coolly taking a match and cigar
                  from his pocket, and lighting the latter.</p>
               <p>"No excuse to give, or explanation to make, sir?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir—that loon, Blacking, has probably told you all that I could. As to
                  excuses, you know I <emph>never</emph> make any. I do all that I can in a matter,
                  and if I fail, it is for no want of exertion on my part."</p>
               <p>"I believe you, boy; and in <emph>this</emph> case you are as deeply interested as
                  I am, for when <emph>I</emph> die all that I have will be yours. Do you think the
                  child can ever be recovered, so that we can get her in our power?"</p>
               <p>"I hope so, father. I have bid high for her, and arranged matters so that Ribera
                  will get her, if possible, and let us know when it is done. If she is not heard
                  from soon, I will fit up an expedition and scour the country where her father has
                  found refuge, as I presume, among some of the Indian tribes."</p>
               <p>"That is well—and you saw Ribera?"</p>
               <p>"I did. He wants you to fit out plenty of vessels for the 'coast,' and to consign
                  them to him. Last year was a scorcher on niggers—they're scarce, and will pay well
                  now!"</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye! That Ribera is a prince in <emph>his</emph> line. He has made a great
                  deal of money for me."</p>
               <p>"And for himself, too, off of your capital, father."</p>
               <p>"Doubtless; he'd be a fool if he did not! Are your cigars landed?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure, before I came into the upper bay. I've been too long in the free
                  trade to run any foolish risks when a few extra dollars will hire lighters!"</p>
               <p>"Well, retire to your room, or where you please, till supper time, my son; I wish
                  to see you then—now I am busy over some papers"</p>
               <p>Marcus retired and so will we, reader, for you observe that the old gentleman is
                  desirous of being alone with his secrets.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
               <p>Pedro Picaro was hunting on Sanabel, an island which extends for some miles along
                  the coast to the east of Boca Grande, and nearly approaches the main land, at
                  Punta Rassa from which it is only separated by the river Caloosa Hatchie, famed as
                  the scene of the massacre of Harney's command in 1839. <ref rend="super"
                     target="#note_002" xml:id="return_002">*</ref>
                  
               </p>
               <note place="inline" xml:id="note_002">
                  
                  <p><ref target="#return_002">*</ref>It occured during an armistice, when Gen. Macomb was trying to make a treaty
                     with the Seminoles. Only Col. Harney and one man escaped.</p>
               </note>
               <p>At a very early date of the settlement of Florida, somewhere between 1511 and
                  1520, a colony of Spaniards settled there, but the warlike Uchees and
                  Seminoles—tribes afterward so blended, that the name of the Uchees passed away and
                  became almost forgotten—drove them away with great loss on the side of the
                  Spaniards, the remnant of whom fled, leaving their stock behind them. Thus the
                  island, which is large and thickly wooded, though interspersed with small and very
                  rich <foreign xml:lang="SPA">savanas</foreign> or prairies, became stocked with
                  large numbers of wild horses, cattle and hogs, especially the latter, which, like
                  the lower class of mankind, are famous for breeding.</p>
               <p>The cattle and horses soon were killed and taken by the Indians, but, like the
                  Hebrews, the Indians are averse to pork when they can get anything else to eat,
                  and the hogs grew and multiplied, and <emph>still</emph> exist in large numbers on
                  the island, as the writer can testify, for he was once <emph>treed</emph> by a
                  gang of them, which, led on by a savage old boar, gave him no time to reload his
                  rifle, after he had floored one of their number, bit came at him, a regular army
                  of <hi rend="i"/>Tusk-anians.</p>
               <p>Pedro Picaro was hunting on this island a few weeks after Pablo Canovas had
                  received that terrible cut from the merciless hand of Marcus Febiger. He had
                  fastened his canoe in a small cove, bordered on either side by dense mangroves,
                  and had advanced up along the edge of a narrow savana, or strip of grassland,
                  toward the centre of the island, until he reached a knoll or mound from which his
                  eye had a wide scope of vision, extending over that prairie and two or three other
                  similar openings. From this he could see small herds of deer feeding in different
                  directions, and also, by the moving of the tall grass, knew that there were many
                  hogs in the range, but he could not see them.</p>
               <p>Carefully repriming his gun, he sat down and finished his cigar; then selecting
                  the gang of deer nearest to windward of him, he commenced moving carefully toward
                  it, keeping low down in the grass so as not to be seen by the timid animals in his
                  approach. He crept on as easily and noiselessly as an Indian, and soon being
                  within fair gun-shot, he selected a large fat buck for his aim and fired. The
                  animal bounded high in the air, then fell headlong to the earth. He had taken his
                  last leap. Pedro was about to rush up and cut the animal's throat, when a loud and
                  hoarse grunt broke upon his ear, and an immense boar rose from a mud-slough, where
                  it had been wallowing, within four or five paces of him—its red eyes glaring
                  maliciously upon him, and its bristles rising in evidence of anger upon its back.
                  Pedro commenced reloading his gun, keeping his eye upon the brute, whose tushes,
                  full six inches long, looked as if they would rip open an alligator, not to speak
                  of a thin-skinned<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6989-00000013"/> Spaniard. But the <hi
                     rend="i"/>porcine warrior was not inclined to give Pedro a chance to claim
                  superiority of weapons, and before Pedro could even get powder into his gun, the
                  boar made progressive demonstrations. The hunter saw that he had no chance but to
                  run for a tree, and he knew that it was a race for life. Off he bounded through
                  the yielding grass, and close at his heels came the enemy—so close that its hot
                  breath and foam seemed to touch his very heels. It was some distance to the trees,
                  but Pedro, who was very agile, would have got to one ahead of the infuriated
                  beast, had he not stumbled over the root of a saw-palmetto, just as he emerged
                  from the prairie, and fell headlong to the ground. The boar was so close to him
                  that it could not check its headway, but, as it passed over his prostrate form,
                  one of its long, sharp tusks hooked into his hunting-shirt, and rent it from top
                  to bottom, making also a deep gash in the fleshy part of his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Stunned by the fall, yet aware of his fearful peril, the Spaniard struggled up to
                  his knees just in time to see his terrible enemy turn and plunge toward him once
                  more, the white foam flying from his mouth, and his red eyes flashing like coals
                  of fire. He could not get up—he crossed himself and closed his eyes, for he
                  thought his time had come. But at that critical instant the sound of a gun rang
                  loud and clear upon his ears, and he opened his eyes to see the boar laying in its
                  last struggles, within a few feet of him, and an Indian standing near, who
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Hog too much for pale face, eh?"</p>
               <p>"You have saved my life!" cried Pedro, rising, and speaking in Spanish, for the
                  Indian had used that language, which, among the lower of fishing Indians of the
                  coast, was quite common, even up to the time of the late war.</p>
               <p>And the next instant the Spaniard, with a wild yell, bounded full ten or twelve
                  feet from where he had been standing, for he felt the poisonous fangs of a serpent
                  sinking deep into his flesh, and as he turned he saw uncoiled the speckled form of
                  a huge moccasin snake, the deadliest of its species.</p>
               <p>"Ugh! Me kill snake and then save life again!" said the Indian, coolly, taking his
                  hatchet and striking off the reptile's head.</p>
               <p>Meantime Pedro lay rolling and writhing upon the ground, moaning and praying to
                  his saints, for he thought that death was certain now.</p>
               <p>"Get up and come to camp of Tustenuggle Hadjo. Don't be <emph>squaw!</emph> Great
                  medicine me—make pale face well—make him laugh at snake!" said the Indian, taking
                  Pedro by the arm.</p>
               <p>The latter rose with difficulty, for the poison was coursing like fire through his
                  veins, and his wounded leg was already beginning to discolor and swell. As the
                  Indian led him on, he plucked several roots from the earth, and, shaking the dirt
                  from them, bade the hunter chew them and swallow the juice. Soon they arrived at
                  the camp, and here Tustenuggle put a small kettle upon the hot coals of his
                  campfire, and filling it with water, threw in a quantity of the roots, and
                  increased his fire so that in a brief space the water was boiling. Then, dipping a
                  cloth in the strong decoction, he commenced bathing the wound, first cutting away
                  the flesh so as to permit it to bleed more freely. And putting some of the liquid
                  in a large gourd to cool, he gave it to the patient to drink as soon as it could
                  be swallowed.</p>
               <p>The latter, who, for a time, was in fearful agony, now began to feel easier, a
                  profuse sweat broke out all over him, the swelling began to go down, and within a
                  couple of hours he was out of all danger. The Indian bound a parcel of the
                  pulverized and steamed root upon the bite, and then said:</p>
               <p>"Pale face all well now—he may go."</p>
               <p>"Not till I have rewarded you—twice you have saved my life! Here are three
                  doubloons; if you will go to my fishing <choice>
                     <sic>ranchce</sic>
                     <corr>ranche</corr>
                  </choice>, I will give you more, and make you other presents!"</p>
               <p>"Me no like pale faces!" said the Indian, refusing the money; and now that he had
                  done his act of humanity, growing haughty and cold.</p>
               <p>"Why, then, did you save my life?"</p>
               <p>"I'd save the life of a <emph>dog</emph> if I did not <emph>stop to think</emph>
                  him or his race had done me wrong."</p>
               <p>"Have the pale-faces done <emph>you</emph> wrong?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>One</emph> has!"</p>
               <p>"It was not me, therefore accept my gift!"</p>
               <p>"No, it was not <emph>you!</emph>" replied the Indian, still refusing the money.
                  "It was a great Medicine—more powerful than I. He could turn wine to gall, and I
                  could not kill him with a bullet. He fills my place in my tribe. and I have hid my
                  face from my people, for I was ashamed, and Micanopee was angered with me."</p>
               <p>"A pale-face did this? When did he come among you?"</p>
               <p>"More than a moon gone by! He came from the big water of salt, in a great canoe
                  with sails!"</p>
               <p>"Had he a little child with him?" asked Pedro, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"Yes, a squaw papoose!" replied Tustenuggle.</p>
               <p>"He is <emph>my</emph> enemy—I would drink his blood! I will kill him, and
                  Tustenuggle shall go back to his people, for when I have killed the pale-face and
                  stolen his papoose, I will give my red brother many guns and much powder, and
                  lead, and red cloth, and heads, and paint, and jewels for his squaws, and make him
                  rich!" cried Pedro, in a fever of delight, for now he felt sure that with the aid
                  of a cunning and revengeful Indian, he could earn the fifteen thousand dollars
                  which Marcus Febiger had offered.</p>
               <p>'Ugh! Pale-faces have forked tongues! They speak one way and look the other!" said
                  the Indian, with his mind full of suspicion.</p>
               <p>"By the God whom the pale-faces worship, I <emph>swear</emph> that I speak the
                  truth!" said Pedro. "Come to our ranche with me and I will give you presents, and
                  make ready for the expedition, and then we will go together and seek the
                  pale-faced Medicine. We will go to him in the night, and I will kill him, and we
                  will steal the child!"</p>
               <p>"What for you want squaw papoose? What good, eh?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I can get money for it—money for <emph>his</emph> scalp, too!"</p>
               <p>"Ugh! me go with you to ranche! kill more deer first, and fill your canoe,
                  though!" said the Indian.</p>
               <p>"How do you know I have a canoe?" asked Pedro.</p>
               <p>"See you when you come ashore—see you shoot big bug—see you when hog make run—me
                  laugh big laugh, till you fall down—then me feel sorry, kill hog and save
                  you!"</p>
               <p>Pedro renewed his thanks and promises, and it was agreed between them to kill game
                  enough to load the canoe, and then they were to go to the ranche and prepare to
                  carry out their plan for the murder of Arpiaka and the abduction of little
                  Ona.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
               <p>A month or more, nearly two, in truth, had rolled along time's endless causeway,
                  since Arpiaka had made his home among the red sons of the forest And though he
                  mourned his lost one, yet he had no regret that he had left the wide, wicked
                  outside world, where crime waxes strong with civilization, and had come among a
                  people whom he found pure, warm-hearted, generous and kind—grateful for kindness,
                  respectful toward wisdom, true each to the other. And his little Ona's cheerful
                  laugh came often like a bird-song upon his ear, as she rolled, and tumbled, and
                  played amidst the garlands of flowers and the baskets of golden-hued fruits, which
                  the dark-eyed Indian girls brought in profusion to her, for they deemed the
                  beautiful child almost an angel. With his books, and flute, and guitar, he whiled
                  away his time, or, at least, that which he did not spend with Chikika and
                  Micanopee, or in attending to the sick. Of hunting he was not fond. Nor did he
                  care to mingle in their pastimes or their martial games. By thus withdrawing
                  himself from common observation, except when actually occupied abroad, and
                  preserving a dignified reserve, he rose in the veneration and respect of the
                  people, for nothing so lessens a man among a community as to mingle in common with
                  them, and to exhibit the feelings, passions and frailties which <emph>every
                     one</emph> possess to a greater or less degree.</p>
               <p>Arpiaka's servants appeared very much attached to him, and his table was ever well
                  supplied <unclear>not only with</unclear> fish, eggs, turtle and game of every
                  kind, but delicious melons, fruits and vegetables. He had nothing on earth to ask
                  for but "society," as the world terms it, and for this he had no desire.</p>
               <p>He stood long at the door of his lodge one night, about a couple of months after
                  his arrival, even until gathering darkness in its density hid the very sky from
                  his view, for he was watching the gathering of a tempest, the marshaling of the
                  clouds as they formed upon the red and gorgeous field spread by the descending
                  sun—their shooting up in black hurrying columns toward the zenith, where, resting
                  and sullenly swelling out in front and on either flank, they seemed to steady
                  themselves for the battle and wait for orders from the king of storms, ere they
                  opened their dread artillery, and sent their red lightnings far and wide across
                  the earth.</p>
               <p>The birds had early flown screaming to their hiding-places in the forest, and the
                  tame animals had huddled together, as they always do when frightened, and
                  everything was very still, not a breath of air moving to shake a leaf. The Indians
                  had mostly gathered within their lodges, carrying in such things as would be
                  injured by the storm. Those who had canoes upon the water, had drawn them up on
                  the land, and Chikika had seen extra fastenings attached to his brother's little
                  schooner at her moorings. As he passed Arpiaka, on his way to his own lodge, the
                  chief spoke to him:</p>
               <p>"The Great Spirit will speak in thunder to the wicked to-night!" he said. "His
                  face is<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6989-00000014"/> very black—the trees of the
                  forest will groan, and the earth will drink the tears of the sky!"</p>
               <p>"Yes—there will be a terrible storm!" said Arpiaka, as Chikika passed on.</p>
               <p>Soon all was darkness and gloom outside, but within his lodge Arpiaka found light
                  and beauty. Clarita, the lovely daughter of Chikika, was lulling Ona to sleep, and
                  the fair child lay on her swelling bosom like a bud resting on the breast of a
                  flower, while the Indian girl gave low-voiced music to her ear, and ever and anon
                  pressed her ripe red lips to the velvet of the young child's cheek.</p>
               <p>A sweet smile came in rosy light on Ona's face, and she opened wide her sleepy
                  eyes, when she saw her loved father, and when he asked her to say mamma's prayer,
                  she lisped the well-remembered words, and then sunk back with parted lips and
                  closed eyes, into the slumber of a cherub. And Clarita bore her into the little
                  curtained room, which had been prepared expressly for them, and laid her down upon
                  her downy bed, and soon, by the side of her sweet charge, was herself wrapped in
                  slumber.</p>
               <p>And now, afar off, was heard a sound as of the rumbling of heavy wheels over some
                  hollow causeway. Nearer and nearer came the rolling sound, nearer still, until
                  crash, <emph>crash</emph>—shaking the earth, and seeming to rend the very heavens,
                  came the terrible thunder! Peal after peal, followed by the hissing lightning, and
                  then by torrents of rain, and by a gale, which howled through the forest like a
                  maddened monster, searching for prey—told how heavily the storm came down. And
                  thus, for hours, it raged; and Arpiaka, safe within his strong-built lodge,
                  listened to it, with that dreamy comfort which we all feel, when we hear a storm,
                  yet are sheltered from its effects. His mind overran the past, with its pathway of
                  sunshine and of cloud, and wandered on to the future, when, in his darling child,
                  he should see the matured picture of her sainted mother; and he took no note of
                  time. He was almost asleep, sitting in his easy-chair, when, suddenly, he saw a
                  shadow upon the opposite wall—the shadow of a man, with a raised dagger in his
                  hand.</p>
               <p>To leap from his seat, ere the intended blow was struck, to turn and confront two
                  armed men, one an Indian—the hateful Tustenuggle—and the other a white man, was
                  the action of a second. The Indian sprung upon him, and grappling with him, nearly
                  cast him to the earth; but the white man rushed into the little room, and, seizing
                  Ona, fled from the house, in spite of the agonized shouts of the father, and his
                  mad struggles to free himself from the grasp of the conjurer. At last, however, he
                  freed one arm, and drawing his knife from his belt, drove it home to the very hilt
                  in the Lack of Tustenuggle, who, with a wild, despairing death-yell, loosed his
                  hold at last, and <unclear>fell lifeless</unclear> to the earth.</p>
               <p>There was a lull in the storm, and that fearful yell was heard all over the
                  village. In a few moments Chikika was there, and an hundred other warriors, and in
                  his agony Arpiaka told his loss. In less time than it takes to describe it, every
                  warrior in the village was bounding away to search for the robber, while Arpiaka
                  could hardly be restrained by Mieanopee, who had come to comfort him, from himself
                  rushing out in the gloom in pursuit, though he knew nothing of the country.</p>
               <p>The corpse of the vile conjurer was dragged forth from the lodge, and cast into a
                  lagoon for the alligators to feed upon, for the king of the Seminoles swore it
                  should have no other burial.</p>
               <p>And all the rest of that dark and bitter night, Arpiaka passed pacing to and fro
                  in his lodge, praying to Heaven, in his agony, either to restore his child to his
                  bosom, or to remove <emph>him</emph> from a world wherein sorrow had so
                  accumulated upon him.</p>
               <p>Morning came, and dawned all the brighter for the storm of the night before, even
                  as a child which has sobbed itself to sleep, wakes with a flush upon its check.
                  And, as the sun went up, warrior after warrior came in, but they brought no
                  tidings of the child. And darker grew the cloud on Arpiaka's face, and heavier the
                  agony of his reft heart. But still a little spark kept the fire of hope alive. The
                  noble, faithful Chikika, and a few of his warriors had not come in—the day
                  advanced, and still they did not return, and Micanopee said:</p>
               <p>"Chikika is on the trail, else he would 'ere this have returned!"</p>
               <p>It was true, for when he came, it was almost night, but he brought news from the
                  Spanish fishing ranche. The offer of Marcus Febiger was related to him, also as
                  one of their number, <hi rend="i"/>Pedro Picaro, was missing, also a boat, with
                  sails large enough to take him safely to Key West, whence he could easily get
                  passage to Havana—the probability was, that <emph>he</emph> had taken the child.
                  This seemed the more probable, because an Indian answering the description of
                  Tustenuggle, had come to the ranche with him, and they had gone away in
                  company.</p>
               <p>When Arpiaka heard this news, he grew calm in an instant. He felt that he had no
                  time for sighs—it was <emph>action</emph> which was now required, or else his
                  child was lost to him for ever. He gave instant orders to refit his little
                  schooner, and put fresh water, and dried meats and bread on board.</p>
               <p>"Where is my brother going?" asked Chikika.</p>
               <p>"To Havana, to regain Ona, or perish in the attempt!" said Arpiaka.</p>
               <p>"Chikika will go with his brother, and take some of his braves with him," said the
                  chief. "And <hi rend="i"/>Maraquita shall go, for she has friends there, and knows
                  the city well, for there she was born. My brother can put her in the dress of the
                  pale-faced women, and she will be of service to him. And the chief of the
                  pale-faced fishermen, though he is much sick from a cut with the long knife of the
                  captain with the black heart, has offered to be my brother's pilot, for he is
                  sorry for him."</p>
               <p>This gave Arpiaka joy, for he saw that he would not be alone in his adventure, but
                  that strong hands and willing hearts would go with him. And he hurried his
                  preparations for the voyage, patching up the shot holes in the sails, and seeing
                  to the stowage of water, provisions, arms and <choice>
                     <sic>amunition</sic>
                     <corr>ammunition</corr>
                  </choice> himself.</p>
               <p>And so expeditious were they, that, towed by a long string of canoes down the
                  creek, at sunrise the next morning, they spread the sails of the little schooner
                  to a fresh breeze, in the outer bay, and headed for the fishing ranche, where it
                  was intended to take the brave and good-hearted Pablo on board.</p>
               <p>The crew consisted of Chikika and four oft-tried warriors, all of whom spoke
                  Spanish, and his favorite wife Maraquita, who, dressed in European style, in one
                  of the dresses of poor Ione, looked now most unlike the wife of a forest chief,
                  and very like a lady.</p>
               <p>Rapidly the little craft skimmed over the waves, and soon she reached the ranche.
                  It did not take long after Arpiaka had met Pablo, to secure the services of the
                  latter, who, though very weak, yet was full of fire and energy, and 'ere another
                  hour elapsed, the schooner was outside of the bar, heading on a cruise for Key
                  West, for there Pablo hoped to overtake the treacherous Picaro, before de could
                  secure a passage in a larger vessel, for he did not think that the villain would
                  dare to cross the Gulf Stream, in so small a boat as that which he had taken,
                  though tradition says that Indians, in olden times, had crossed in canoes.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
               <p>It was noon, or thereabouts. Don Rafael de Ribera was in the counting-room of his
                  large store and warehouse on Calle de Mercadores, giving directions to his
                  bookkeepers and clerks, for he was heavily engaged in an apparently regular
                  mercantile business, and few, not even excepting his own clerks, beside those
                     <emph>directly interested</emph>, were aware of the other nefarious branches of
                  the trade with which he was linked, such as slave catching, piracy, etc., etc.
                  Pablo had spoken the truth when he told Marcus Febiger that he knew who and what
                  Ribera was. Ready to add to his immense fortune by any means, utterly
                  unscrupulous, with thieves and assassins always at command, Ribera was equal to
                  any villany that the mind of depravity could concoct.</p>
               <p>At about the time mentioned above, a man, whose wan face and reddened eyes
                  indicated fatigue and lengthened vigils, presented himself in Ribera's
                  counting-room, and asked to see Don Rafael. He was dressed in the coarse garb of a
                  fisherman, and had enough of the scoundrel in his face to, satisfy such a keen
                  physiognomist as Don Rafael, that he was one.</p>
               <p>"I am Ribera!" said that individual. "What do you want?"</p>
               <p>"I have business with you, senor, but I will only reveal it to you in
                  private!"</p>
               <p>Ribera at once led the way to an inner of flee, which was unoccupied. "Now," said
                  he, "you can state your business!"</p>
               <p>"A child, if found, was to be delivered to your care for El Capitano Marcus
                  Febiger!" said the man.</p>
               <p>"Yes!" replied Ribera.</p>
               <p>"My name is Pedro Picaro, a fisherman from the Boca Grande, and I have got that
                  child in the city!"</p>
               <p>"Upon its delivery you are entitled to ten thousand dollars, which I will pay.
                  Have you got the scalp of the father, also?"</p>
               <p>"No, senor! I had enough to do to get away with the child, but I left the man in a
                  death struggle with a powerful and desperate Indian, and do not doubt but that he
                  fell in the conflict. I had no time to await the result, for the Indian village
                  was alarmed, and a rapid flight only could save me, and I knew from the words of
                  el capitano that the possession of the child was all-important!"</p>
               <p>"True, my good fellow, true!"</p>
               <p>"Shall I bring the child at once, senor?" asked Pedro, whose fingers itched to
                  handle a sum of money larger than he, in his wildest dreams, had ever thought of
                  possessing.</p>
               <p>"No, bring it to my private residence in Calle Obradapia, to-night at ten, when I
                  am disengaged, and your money shall be ready for you!" replied Ribera. "I do not
                     wish<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6989-00000015"/> it seen here, and shall be
                  occupied until then!"</p>
               <p>"I will be there at the hour, senor!" said Pedro and he departed.</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>It lacked but a half hour of ten, and Don Rafael de Ribera sat in the room where
                  we first saw him. Before him, upon a table, lay ten thousand dollars in gold,
                  ready to be paid upon the delivery of poor Ona.</p>
               <p>A knock, peculiar in its character, for it was four distinct raps repeated at
                  intervals of about ten seconds, was heard at the door, and Ribera bade the <hi
                     rend="i"/>rappor enter.</p>
               <p>A man came in, whose small snake-like eyes glittered from under a dark, cliff-like
                  brow, and whose slender yet muscular figure gave token of great activity as well
                  as strength. His features and expression were not such as you would like to note
                  in a new-found traveling companion, if you were in a lonely vicinity.</p>
               <p>"You sent for me, senor; have you work for me? If so, I'm glad, for I'm on my last
                  doubloon, and my <foreign xml:lang="SPA">cuchillo</foreign> (knife) is growing
                  rusty for want of use!" said this man, as he came in.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Ribera, "you know that I only send for you when I want you. I leave
                  you to devote the rest of your time to <hi rend="i"/>monte and the women!"</p>
               <p>"Which are such expensive pastimes that the more often you send for me the better
                  am I suited!" replied the other. "But what have I to do now?"</p>
               <p>"You observe this gold?"</p>
               <p>"Seeing that it is before me, I can't well help it, senor," said the other; "but I
                  have no objection to making a closer observation!"</p>
               <p>"Well, you can do so, and with my consent. There are ten thousand <foreign
                     xml:lang="SPA">pesos</foreign> there, which I shall pay to a man who will be
                  here in twenty minutes. You will know him when he comes, if you watch outside, by
                  his having a small child with him. When he leaves he will bear with him this
                  money, and a secret which I should like to have hushed forever. Attend to him, and
                  take half of that money—restore to me the other half!"</p>
               <p>"It shall be done, senor!" said the professional assassin, for such he
                     <emph>was</emph>, drawing his long, broad-bladed but sharp-pointed and
                  doubled-edged knife, and feeling of its edges.</p>
               <p>And then, with a kind of coarse smile, he said:</p>
               <p>"What should hinder me from keeping <emph>all</emph>, senor?"</p>
               <p>"The knowledge that I never would employ you again!" replied Ribera.</p>
               <p>"True senor, you have been too valuable a patron for me to lose by dishonesty. Do
                  not retire after he leaves you; I shall make it quick work and sure, with him, and
                  you shall have your gold back before you sleep!"</p>
               <p>"Don't do the job too near <emph>my</emph> door—the authorities might smell blood
                  inside if you did!"</p>
               <p>"No danger, senor; I'll drop him before the door of some holy padre, so that if he
                  can't have the consolation of religion in his last moments, he may be within
                  smelling distance of it!"</p>
               <p>"Very well, go to your post now, Battista; it lacks but ten minutes of the time,
                  and men wanting money are more apt to be early than late!"</p>
               <p>The assassin bowed and departed. Scarcely had he gone when Pedro Picaro entered
                  with the child.</p>
               <p>Poor Ona, she was as pale as a white cloth, and her great, dark eyes were reddened
                  with long weeping. She seemed to be almost dead with terror.</p>
               <p>"This is the child, senor!" said the villain.</p>
               <p>"And there is your money; take it, and much good may it do you!" said Ribera, at
                  the same time ringing a bell.</p>
               <p>Pedro clutched the gold, and, without stopping to count it, thrust it into his
                  pockets with a nervous hand. He had but just done so when a servant entered.</p>
               <p>"Send Monona here!" said Ribera to the servant.</p>
               <p>"If I get the scalp of the father, I will see you again, senor!" said Pedro, as he
                  turned to depart.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Do!</emph>" said Ribera, with a covert smile upon his face.</p>
               <p>Pedro had but just left the room when a very good-looking Spanish girl came
                  in.</p>
               <p>"Monona, take this poor little thing and care for it tenderly, until its relatives
                  call for it; but let it not be out of your sight for a moment. I hold you
                  responsible for its safety!" said Ribera.</p>
               <p>The girl took Ona up and spoke kind words and kissed her, and then the speechless
                  terror of the child passed away, and while two great tears rose in her eyes, she
                  murmured: "Oh, take Ona to her papa!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, by-and-bye, love!" said Monona. "Come with me, now, and I will give you
                  something nice!"</p>
               <p>The child smiled through her tears, a sweet, bright smile, like sunlight shining
                  through a shower, and cheerfully went with her new nurse.</p>
               <p>Then Ribera waited for the return of Battista. He had not long to wait. In a very
                  few minutes that individual came in and emptied out the gold upon the table which
                  Pedro had carried away, also several other articles, such as a knife, silver
                  crucifix, cigar case, etc,, which he had found on the body of the wretch who had
                  most deservedly met death just when he had consummated his rascality and received
                  the reward.</p>
               <p>Battista was as calm and collected as if he had only been knocking some worthless
                  cur in the head, or been martyring a litter of blind kittens. No nervousness about
                     <emph>him!</emph> He was too much in practice to be <choice>
                     <sic>guitly</sic>
                     <corr>guilty</corr>
                  </choice> of that.</p>
               <p>"You're back very speedily; did he give you any trouble, Battista?" asked Ribera,
                  as the assassin entered.</p>
               <p>"None in the world, senor. He laid down and went to sleep without a word! I gave
                  him about eight inches right between the shoulders. There is the money, you can
                  count out my proportion."</p>
               <p>"How many does this make, Battista, that you have sent to a better world for me?"
                  asked Ribera, as he commenced laying the doubloons off equally in two piles.</p>
               <p>"Nineteen, senor!" said Battista, pausing a moment to count up. "Nineteen, and I
                  hope, senor, that you'll soon find me a twentieth, for I hate odd numbers
                  deucedly."</p>
               <p>"We'll see, we'll see; there is <emph>one</emph> man, if I can get him here, from
                  New York, whose score I should like to wipe out! But always be within reach of me,
                  no fear but that I shall keep you in work as long as you are sure and trusty!"</p>
               <p>"I will do so, senor," said the assassin, and then he took his gold and
                  departed.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
               <p>A precious trio sat in the same room in the old stone mansion, where, so far, we
                  have only met Mr. Febiger, senior, and his visiters. It consisted of that
                  individual, his son, and Counsellor Blacking. And money was the text upon which
                  they held <hi rend="i"/>dialogue-ic discourse—money, that curse which every one,
                  (except authors), seems so ready to bear—that "necessary evil"—I quote from Daly,
                     <title>Justice</title> (?)—which makes more men villains, more women unvirtuous
                  and more people miserable, generally, than any other ill on earth. By the
                  banishment of money, the Spartans became the purest, noblest race on earth; luxury
                  was afterwards introduced, and they dwindled down to less than nothing.</p>
               <p>"Don't you think you can <emph>make</emph> some evidence, which will suit our
                  purpose in the Orphan's Court? Something to silence that <emph>very</emph>
                  conscientious judge?" asked the eldest Febiger.</p>
               <p>"Had not some meddling individual not only notified him of the marriage, but also
                  of the birth of her child, it might be done. I <emph>could</emph> get men to swear
                  that both were dead, but then the husband would be asked after—certificates of
                  burial required, and many a question asked which will bother us for a reply! Some
                  one in this city is keeping a watch on us, I am sure, and as we tread in the dark,
                  we must step carefully!"</p>
               <p>"Can it be that cursed old Queer, that is meddling? He used to be very intimate
                  with Ione's father!" said the elder Febiger.</p>
               <p>"If I thought so, he'd <emph>drop</emph> off of one of our wharves, with a '56'
                  tied to his neck, one of these dark nights," muttered Marcus.</p>
               <p>At that moment a servant entered with a letter, which he handed to the last-named
                  person.</p>
               <p>"Hip, hip, hurrah! hurrah! <emph>Eureka</emph>, she is found, and safe in the
                  hands of Ribera!" cried Marcus, as he hastily glanced over the contents of the
                  letter.</p>
               <p>"And her father?" asked the father.</p>
               <p>"Left in a death-hug with an Indian, and <emph>supposed</emph> to be properly
                  cared for!" said Marcus, carelessly,</p>
               <p>"All will then go easy!" said the wily counsellor. "Produce the child to the
                  court, with evidence which we can <emph>make</emph> of the death of both of her
                  parents by fever, or something of that sort, in the south, and claim your rights
                  as her nearest relative and natural guardian!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I see!" said the elder Febiger.</p>
               <p>"Then," continued the wretch, "if she <emph>should</emph> take sick and die, of
                  course all her property reverts to you!"</p>
               <p>"I see, I see!" and the old man rubbed his thin dry hands together with
                  pleasure.</p>
               <p>"Well, I'll be off in the Belladonna after the brat, as soon as I can get
                  provisions and water aboard!" said Marcus.</p>
               <p>"I think I'll take the voyage with you!" said his father. "I want to see Ribera—it
                  is a long time since I have had a settlement with him! I can easily so arrange my
                  business as to leave it."</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, there's plenty of room for you, but what about the marriage with old
                  Tapscott's girl, that you say you've arranged for me. You say she'll bring in a
                  clear half million—hadn't that better be attended to before we go, and then let a
                  bridal trip be our excuse for going out in ballast?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my son, yes; you are thoughtful and<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6989-00000016"/>
                  right. It can very easily be arranged, for the girl, if she doesn't exactly love
                  you, does not dislike you, and is, as all girls ought to be, obedient to her
                  father, who snapped at the bait I offered the moment he saw it! Yes, I will see
                  him at once, and have the union brought about as soon as possible. Meantime, since
                  Ribera has got the child, I have no fear for its safety. He is as true as
                  steel!"</p>
               <p>"Where it is his <emph>interest</emph> to be so!" said Marcus, drily.</p>
               <p>"As it surely is in this ease, and in all of his dealings with <emph>me!</emph>"
                  said the old man. "You had better make Miss Tapscott a visit to-night, and play
                  the agreeable, as you know full well how to do!" continued Mr. Febiger to his son.
                  "In the meanwhile, I will see the father to-day, and urge the matter on!"</p>
               <p>"Very well, sir, I'll try and work up to the young lady—I <emph>think</emph> I can
                  please when I try!"</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XV</head>
               <p>The night was dark and stormy when Arpiaka's schooner came in sight of the light
                  which stands on Moro's lofty height, at the mouth of the harbor of Habana. He had
                  been in Key West, and there had learned that a small boat like that in which Pedro
                  Picaro had fled, had been seen off the coast, steering south-west for the Havana,
                  but had not stopped. He only remained long enough to take out a registry and
                  papers for his boat, which, with the aid of a little money, he managed to do, and
                  then cleared regularly for Habana, knowing what a strict surveillance was kept in
                  that port, and the necessity of care in his movements. He had called his schooner
                  the "IONE," in memory of his loved one, lost forever.</p>
               <p>"Shall we run in to-night, Pablo?" he asked of his pilot.</p>
               <p>"It is against the rules of the harbor, senor, but with such a gale as this
                  blowing, and every appearance of an increase, I think that our necessity and
                  danger will excuse us, even if the captain of the guard boat should see and bring
                  us to. But, ten chances to one that we shall slip in unobserved in the darkness,
                  and, if we do, I will steer up past the shipping in the harbor, and run into a
                  little dock where I think we can lay unnoticed. If we succeed in that, I will go
                  on shore with Maraquita, who, as well as myself, has friends here, and we will
                  arrange for an interview with Ribera, and also for carrying off the child in
                  safety, if we get her."</p>
               <p>"<emph>If</emph>, Pablo—IF? There must be no <emph>if</emph> about
                     <unclear>it.</unclear> I will recover her or perish!"</p>
               <p>"I pray the holy virgin that you may, senor; but we must be cautious. I must first
                  learn whether or not Ribera <emph>has</emph> the child. That can be done through
                  Maraquita, for I have laid the plan for her."</p>
               <p>"You are a brave and noble man, Pablo. If we succeed, your reward shall place you
                  in independence for life."</p>
               <p>"I have begged you before, senor, not to speak to me of a reward. Gold is not my
                  impelling power. Rather than to possess one thousand doubloons in my hand, would I
                  have one blow with a true blade, at that cowardly villain who struck me down at
                  his feet!"</p>
               <p>The light on the Moro grew brighter and brighter each moment that they conversed,
                  for they were nearing it now very rapidly, for the water was more smooth after
                  they left the current of the Gulf Stream.</p>
               <p>All of Arpiaka's crew—now much altered in appearance, for they had laid aside
                  their forest garb and were dressed as sailors—were on the alert, watching the
                  light on the rocky height, and occasionally glancing at the other lights which,
                  through the dense darkness, could be seen twinkling on the shore. Pablo, now that
                  he had marks to steer by, put out the lamps of their little binnacle, and made
                  every one on board keep the most perfect silence.</p>
               <p>It was after midnight when the "Ione" swept in through the narrow entrance between
                  the Punta and the Moro, and, though she passed very near the guard-boat, which
                  they knew by its light, and which lay moored to one of the buoys placed above the
                  wreck of an English frigate, sunk there many years before. She was not hailed. Nor
                  in passing up the crowded harbor did she meet with any obstruction, and, in a
                  short time, Pablo, with a skillful hand, ran her into the little obscure and
                  disused dock which he had named, where, close under the shadow of some old
                  buildings falling into ruins, she lay.</p>
               <p>"Senor, if you please, be seen as little as possible, and keep the crew out of
                  sight until I return," said Pablo. "I go to see if the Belladonna is in the
                  harbor, and Maraquita will go with me to learn where the child is."</p>
               <p>"How soon will you return?" asked Arpiaka.</p>
               <p>"As soon as that which I have said I would do is done!" replied the old fisherman.
                  "Let me entreat you, senor," he continued, "to be patient. This Ribera is
                  immensely wealthy and unscrupulous. He has ever a gang of assassins at his beck,
                  and the least imprudence on our part will put him on his guard, and then not a
                  chance of success would be left to us, even if we escaped with our lives."</p>
               <p>"I put the entire direction of the matter in your hands, Pablo," replied Arpiaka,
                  "for your bravery and prudence are unequalled. Money will be useful, will it not,
                  in your enterprize?"</p>
               <p>"It may be, senor. In this city it is more powerful than steel."</p>
               <p>"Then take with you this bag of gold. Fear not to use it freely, I have plenty
                  more on board."</p>
               <p>"I will not misuse it, senor. And now, for a time, farewell! Come, Maraquita,
                  come."</p>
               <p>The pilot and Chikika's wife now stepped on shore, and Arpiaka and his crew
                  retired into the little cabin, all seeking repose except the former, whose anxiety
                  would not permit him to close his eyes.</p>
               <p>It was nearly noon of the next day before Pablo returned, and Arpiaka began to
                  seriously fear that the former had met with some misfortune, or had been forcibly
                  detained. His patience was nearly exhausted, when Canovas made his appearance.</p>
               <p>"I suppose you feared I would never come," said the pilot.</p>
               <p>"If you come with news as bright as your face, you will lift a heavy load from my
                  heart," replied Arpiaka. "Time hangs with clogging weight upon an anxious
                  mind."</p>
               <p>"My news <emph>is</emph> good," replied Pablo. "The child is here and in the house
                  of Ribera. If you will adopt a plan which I have been working up in my own mind, I
                  think you car obtain her without a doubt."</p>
               <p>"Name your plan, and do not fear but that I will adopt it."</p>
               <p>"Go boldly to Ribera at his counting-room, and ask for a private interview; then
                  pretend you have a large capital which you wish to entrust to his care, to be
                  invested in the slave trade. As he works that business very secretly, for fear of
                  British interference, he will probably ask you to his house to make your deposit
                  at night, and <emph>we</emph>, in carrying your boxes, <emph>supposed</emph> to
                  contain gold, can be introduced along with you into the house. Then, if we cannot
                     <emph>force</emph> him to deliver the child, I am mistaken in our power."</p>
               <p>"An excellent plan. He does not, I am convinced, know me, and it cannot fail. I
                  will put it into execution at once. Is the Belladonna in port?"</p>
               <p>"No, senor."</p>
               <p>"Then we surely will succeed!"</p>
               <p>"I think so, senor. I hope that all will be done to-night, for the wind blows fair
                  off the coast, and we may be as lucky in leaving the harbor as we were in coming
                  in. By the way, senor, I have heard of Pedro Picaro, who stole the child
                  away."</p>
               <p>"What of the wretch?"</p>
               <p>He was found assassinated in the street, without a <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >reale</foreign> about him. It was probably done by some of Ribera's bravos, to
                  regain the money which he paid him."</p>
               <p>"It is good news. The villain is out of <emph>our</emph> way, and properly
                  punished for his crimes!" said Arpiaka, as he entered the cabin, and proceeded to
                  arrange his toilet, preparatory to his visit to Ribera, whither it is scarcely
                  necessary for us to accompany him, since we know what his business is.</p>

               <p>It was night once more, and Ribera sat in his favorite apartment—favorite because
                  it was so near his cherished gold—smoking as usual. And a look of satisfaction was
                  seated upon his repulsive face, for he anticipated a large addition to his already
                  enormous hoard.</p>
               <p>"What infernal fools these Yankees are!" he said to himself. "Though slavery

                     <emph>our</emph> planters do, they'd have to import the article, or their stock
                  would soon run out. They go in for breeding; we go in for buying fresh stock as
                  fast as the old wears out, and don't have any bother with such worthless stock as
                  young or old niggers!"</p>

               <p>Ribera's cogitations were cut short by a knock at his door, and the next moment
                  Arpiaka entered.</p>
               <p>"Ah, good evening, senor Americana; you are punctual, I see!" said the
                  Spaniard.</p>
               <p>"In weighty matters, I always am!" replied Arpiaka. "My men are below with the
                  gold; shall I order them up here?"</p>
               <p>"If you please, senor!"</p>
               <p>Arpiaka gave a low whistle, and immediately Pablo and Chikika, with three of his
                  best warriors, all clad as mariners, appeared, each bearing a heavy box, which, at
                  a sign from Arpiaka, they deposited on the floor near Ribera, whose snake-like
                  eyes glittered with pleasure as he looked upon the supposed treasure.</p>
               <p>"Your men can retire, senor!" said he, "and we will count your gold, and see that
                  it is right, and then I will give you a receipt for it!"</p>
               <p>"A question or two, if you please, senor Ribera, <emph>before</emph> they retire!"
                  said Arpiaka. "I believe that you recently made the acquaintance of one <hi
                     rend="i"/>Pedro Picaro!"</p>
               <p>Ribera started as if he had been stung by a scorpion, and a greyish pallor
                  overspread his swarthy face.</p>
               <p>"Can you tell me where he is? One of my men is an old comrade of his!" continued
                  Arpiaka.</p>
               <p>"What has that to do with our business, senor?" asked Ribera, with a tremor in his
                  voice.</p>
               <p>"Much with <emph>mine!</emph>" <unclear>said Arpiaka, sternly.</unclear> "Where is
                  the child for the delivery of which you paid ten thousand dollars?"</p>
               <p>"Beyond <emph>your</emph> reach, curse you! <emph>This</emph> is your business, is
                  it!" cried Ribera, springing toward a bell on the table. But he did not reach it,
                  for, with a glittering knife in his hand, Pablo sprung before him.</p>
               <p>In a second a knife also flashed in Ribera's hand, and he turned upon Arpiaka, but
                  Chikika wrenched the weapon from him with one hand, and with the other clutched
                  his throat with a suffocating grasp.</p>
               <p>"You are not quite so expert as the assassin of Pedro Picaro!" said Arpiaka. "Do
                  not hold him quite so tight, Chikika, you will not leave him breath enough to
                  answer a few more questions I have to ask!"</p>
               <p>The chief relaxed his hold, but when Ribera attempted to raise an alarm by an
                  outcry, he renewed his vice-like grasp.</p>
               <p>"If you attempt the least alarm, your life shall be the forfeit!" said Arpiaka,
                  sternly, now for the first time drawing a weapon "I am no trifler, so
                     <emph>beware!</emph> I came here for my child—where is she? Chikika, release
                  his throat, but if he utters one word, except to reply to my questions, choke him
                  to death as you would a worthless dog!"</p>
               <p>The chief obeyed, and the almost suffocated Spaniard was allowed a chance to
                  breathe once more.</p>
               <p>"Speak, villain, speak! Where is my child?"</p>
               <p>"In my house, in the care of a nurse!" gasped the now thoroughly terrified wretch.
                  "Let me go, and I will bring her to you!"</p>
               <p>"Softly, Don Rafael, softly! I am not quite such a fool as that. You will have the
                  kindness to tell me in what apartment the child is, and <emph>I</emph> will go for
                  it, leaving you in care of those who will take your life at the first sign of
                  treachery or attempt to make an alarm! Speak now, and no deceit, or you will not
                  have much time to repent in!"</p>
               <p>"She is in the second room to the right, as you pass out of that door, senor!"
                  said Ribera, pointing to a different passage from that by which they had
                  entered.</p>
               <p>"If you deceive me, remember that you die!" said Arpiaka, sternly, as he took a
                  lamp from the table and turned toward the door.</p>
               <p>"I speak the <emph>truth!</emph>" said Ribera, as Arpiaka went out.</p>
               <p>"It's a wonder that <emph>it</emph> don't choke you!" muttered Pablo.</p>
               <p>In a few moments Arpiaka returned, and is<figure>

                  <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6989-00000018"/> his arms was Ona, who clung to his neck
                  and covered his face with kisses, while she sobbed joyfully,
                     "Papa—papa—<emph>dear</emph> papa!"</p>
               <p>Before him, pale with terror, came Monona, the nurse, for he was determined to
                  prevent any chance of an alarm being given, and she was the only one he had met.
                  Carefully locking the door by which he had entered, Arpiaka put the key in his
                  pocket, and then said:</p>
               <p>"Bind and gag both Ribera and the girl quickly; do your work securely, for no
                  alarm must be given until we have left the city far behind!"</p>
               <p>Ribera began to beg and Monona to weep.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry for you, my poor girl!" said Arpiaka, kindly, "but I must do this to
                  save my child. You will probably be released by morning, and will suffer no
                  injury, but we must leave <emph>you</emph> secured for our own safety. As to
                  Ribera, I would do no more than justice were I to silence him
                  <emph>forever</emph>. He may well be thankful that I spare his life. Bind the
                  villain tight, Pablo, and put a gag in his mouth which he can't swallow!"</p>
               <p>The old fisherman needed no urging on that point. He so detested the character of
                  Ribera that he would have willingly silenced him forever, instead of temporarily,
                  if that had been the order.</p>
               <p>In a short time, the two were firmly secured and laid upon their backs in
                  different parts of the room, and so fastened that they could not aid each other in
                  any way. Then wrapping Ona in his cloak, Arpiaka and his men departed, he
                  carefully locking the door behind him, and carrying the key away.</p>
               <p>"Your master bade me tell you that he must not be disturbed by any one; he is
                  engaged on business for me!" said Arpiaka to the porter, as he went out.</p>
               <p>"I will obey him, senor; the Pope shouldn't see him if he came!" replied the man,
                  bowing very low, for a doubloon had been placed in his hand.</p>
               <p>One hour later and the gallant little schooner dashed out of the harbor as swiftly
                  and quietly as she had come in, and before the day dawned she was far out upon the
                  blue waters of the gulf, so far that only the dim outlines of the "Paps" and the
                  Sierras de Hierro could be seen from her deck. And, almost as lightly as
                     <emph>she</emph> danced over the waves, bounded the heart of Arpiaka, for he
                  had recovered his child, and he was now determined to so guard her, that she never
                  again should be wrested from him. He knew very well why they had abducted her, and
                  the value of the fortune to which she was heir, and that no risk would be
                  considered too great or adventure too desperate by the Febigers, if she could be
                  snatched from him.</p>
               <p>The return voyage of the "<hi rend="i"/>Ione" was speedy and prosperous. And
                  Arpiaka's arrival with Ona, at the Seminole village, was hailed with rapturous
                  delight, for in the eyes of the tribe he stood second only to Micanopee. And that
                  good chief embraced him, and gave orders that hereafter watchful sentinels should
                  ever keep guard around his lodge, although Arpiaka felt safe since Tustenuggle and
                  Pedro Picaro were both dead, for he knew of no one else who was near that felt
                  enmity toward him.</p>
               <p>But the old king was firm in his resolve, and the sentinels were posted. And once
                  more Clarita clasped her lovely charge to her pure young bosom, and again the
                  Indian maidens almost deluged the child with flowers and fruit.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
               <p>Nearly a month had elapsed since Ona had been wrested from the charge of Ribera,
                  and not having heard from the Febigers, he almost hoped, under the circumstances,
                  that his letter to Marcus had miscarried, but he was disappointed there. For one
                  day, about the time mentioned above, one of his clerks came in and announced that
                  the "Belladonna" had just arrived and cast anchor in the harbor.</p>
               <p>He did not wish to meet Marcus Febiger in his counting-room, for he expected "a
                  scene" when his news was broken; therefore, as it was nearly night, he repaired to
                  his private residence, and there awaited the anticipated visit.</p>
               <p>He had not long to tarry, for an half hour had not passed when Marcus Febiger made
                  his appearance.</p>
               <p>"How are you, my old friend, king of the Black Birds, etc., how are you!" he cried
                  heartily, as he extended his hand to Ribera upon entering.</p>
               <p>"How do you do, captain, how do you do? Sit down; how did you leave your
                  father?"</p>
               <p>"As sick as a dolphin with a hook in its mouth; he's been sea-sick all the way
                  out, but a night's rest in smooth water will put him to rights! He'll wet his
                  whistle with you in the morning!"</p>
               <p>"What, is <emph>he</emph> a passenger with you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and I have another—my <emph>wife!</emph> I know that surprises you, but a
                  half million of dollars induced me to sacrifice myself, and the girl wasn't bad
                  looking!"</p>
               <p>"I congratulate you! You must make my house your home during your stay here. Your
                  bride and your father will be most welcome!"</p>
               <p>"Our stay will be short, Don Rafael. My father at last begins to feel that he is
                  almost rich enough, and talks of drawing in his funds and retiring from business.
                  His object in coming out was to see you and close up matters, I believe! But how
                  is the little girl?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, captain, I have bad news there!"</p>
               <p>"What, is she <emph>dead?</emph> Well, <emph>that</emph> doesn't matter, for the
                  property will all revert to my father, and remain in the family!"</p>
               <p>"But she is <emph>not</emph> dead! I wish she was, or had been before she was
                  brought here!"</p>
               <p>"The devil! Where is she?"</p>
               <p>"Her father, aided by a gang of Indians and an old Spaniard, who knew me, rescued
                  her from my charge and nearly killed <emph>me</emph>. For over twelve hours I and
                  her nurse lay gagged in this room, and bound so tight that we could not move. It
                  was hours after I was discovered and released before I could stand!"</p>
               <p>"How in the name of Satan could he so get to windward of you?"</p>
               <p>"By pretending to be what he was not, for you gave me no description, not even his
                  name, which I do not know now. He pretended that he wanted to invest money in the
                  Guinea trade; I believed him, told him to have it brought here, and thus he and
                  his gang were introduced. Having me in his power, he bound and gagged me as I have
                  told you, and then carried away the child, and with his Indian allies fled, the
                  Lord above only knows where, for I could get no track of him after I was
                  released!"</p>
               <p>"This <emph>is</emph> a pretty kettle of fish!" muttered young Febiger. "The old
                  man will be madder than a stump-tailed bull in fly-time, when he hears of it!"</p>
               <p>"Getting mad will not help the matter!" said Ribera. "I did my best, paid out ten
                  thousand dollars for the child, and kept her safely until the father tricked
                  me!"</p>
               <p>"Curse <emph>him;</emph> I'd like to have him in range of my pistols!"</p>
               <p>"I wouldn't, if he was armed!" said Ribera. "He has got <emph>enough</emph> of the
                  devil in him when he's roused, I can assure you of that!"</p>
               <p>"I'll send him where he can get a little more!"—said Febiger, bitterly—"from the
                  original source, if ever I meet him!"</p>
               <p>"I suppose you'll 'retire' too, now that you have got married!" said Ribera,
                  wishing to change the subject.</p>
               <p>"Cursed the bit will I! No, I cannot live without excitement, and as soon as I
                  near the edge of my honeymoon, I shall be in my old track again. But I don't like
                  this news of yours—it will set worse than sea-sickness on my father's stomach. For
                  years he had been arranging for me to marry the mother of that child, and thus to
                  secure her fortune. But the pretty fool took a dislike to me and my rough ways,
                  and took a liking to another—and when my father tried a little coersion, she
                  suddenly turned up among the missing, and the next we heard of her was on the
                  receipt of a copy of her certificate of marriage!"</p>
               <p>"And your father, you say, thinks of drawing in all his capital from the trade,
                  and quitting business?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, so he says—but I must be off aboard; you'll see him in the morning, and if
                  he don't come like a north-easter, I'm mistaken. Good night!"</p>
               <p>"He'd better come in a calm; he's not in New York now, and never <emph>may
                     be</emph>, if he arouses the serpent in <emph>my</emph> nature!" muttered the
                  Spaniard, after young Febiger had gone. "If he withdraws all his money, he'll
                  cripple some of my boldest operations. By a strict account, and doubtless he keeps
                  one, I should have to pay him nearly <emph>three millions of dollars</emph>. It
                     <emph>must</emph> not be done. No, he dies first! The son has no heart, and
                  will rather rejoice than mourn if the old man is put out of the way, for he is a
                  spend-thrift, and will be glad to have what he never has had—a full sweep at a few
                  millions. I can fool <emph>him</emph> in my accounts, which is more than I can do
                  with his father. Yes, if the old man annoys me, he must travel <emph>the</emph>
                  path! I have too much at risk to have <emph>one</emph> man place a barrier in my
                  way and live!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
               <p>True to the prognostication of his son, recovered from his sea-sickness, and
                  literally "boiling over" with rage and disappointment, the elder Febiger came like
                  a "north-easter," the butt-end of one at that, to the house of Ribera, at an early
                  hour the next morning.</p>
               <p>His usually pale face was red with passion—his lank frame was quivering with
                  nervous agitation—his usually placid and calculating coolness all gone.</p>
               <p>"My dear sir, I am very glad to see you!" said Ribera, politely, as he received
                  his choleric visitor.</p>
               <p>"And I'm cursed sorry to see <emph>you</emph>, under the circumstances. You had a
                  fortune of mine in your hands when you had that child, and you've lost it,
                  sir—lost it!"</p>
               <p>"Through no fault of mine, my dear sir!"</p>
               <p>"It's a lie, sir, it's a lie! You should have locked her up where you keep your
                  gold, sir—have killed her before you parted with her!"</p>
               <p>Ribera's face grew black with passion, but with a strong effort of will he so
                  mastered it as to hide all outward show in a moment, and he replied:</p>
               <p>"Such were not my instructions!"</p>
               <p>"Curse a man that always needs instructions! What is judgment given to a man for?
                  I suppose you expect the ten thousand dollars that you paid for the child?"</p>
               <p>"Having paid it out by your son's order, of course I do!"</p>
               <p>"You shall never have a cent of it!"</p>
               <p>"I believe I have considerable money in my hands belonging to you, Mr.
                  Febiger!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but you'll not say so two hours from now! I demand an instant
                  settlement!"</p>
               <p>"Are you <emph>prepared</emph> to close up your accounts, sir?" said Ribera, and a
                  sinister, almost sardonic smile, flitted over his face as he spoke.</p>
               <p>"Yes—have got my account book with me on purpose!" said Febiger, producing a small
                  ledger.</p>
               <p>"Are all our transactions recorded in that small book?" asked Ribera, with an air
                  and tone of curious surprise.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and by my own hand! Do you think I require a dozen volumes, and a half a
                  score of clerks, for such a matter?"</p>
               <p>A gleam of satisfaction passed over the countenance of Ribera, as he replied:</p>
               <p>"By no means, my dear sir—I do not underrate your business capacity at all. But
                  let us proceed to business, at least, in a good humor. I have been unfortunate
                  enough in displeasing you, let alone the loss of ten thousand dollars, for of that
                  I'll say no more. Take a glass of wine with me, and then we will proceed to
                  compare accounts!"</p>
               <p>"Now that you are beginning to talk reason, I will!" replied Febiger, coming down
                  a little in his tempestuous anger.</p>
               <p>The wily and remorseless Spaniard opened a small cupboard, and poured out two
                  goblets of wine. He did not pour both from the same bottle, though in color they
                  did not differ. But Febiger did not observe this, for his eye was running over a
                  column of figures in his account-book.</p>
               <p>"Here is some choice old wine, sir—such as you probably never tasted before!" said
                  Ribera, handing him one goblet, and raising the other to his own lips. "Your
                  health sir, and success to you on your next voyage!"</p>
               <p>Febiger merely nodded, and drained his glass at the same time with Ribera.</p>
               <p>"It <emph>is</emph> old—it smacks of—of—<emph>death!</emph> You've murdered me!"
                  he yelled, as a sudden fire seemed to dart through him.</p>
               <p>With a face distorted with sudden and indescribable agony, and his hands
                     outstretched<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6989-00000020"/> to clutch the Spaniard by
                  the throat, he made on <unclear>bound</unclear> toward him—but fell short of his
                  mark—fell dead upon the floor!</p>
               <p>"A very sudden case of <emph>apoplexy</emph>—that poison leaves no trace!" said
                  the murderer, calmly taking out his pocket handkerchief, and wiping away a little
                  froth which had gathered upon the dead man's lips.</p>
               <p>Then he rung a bell, and said to the servant: "Hasten to the schooner
                  'Belladonna,' which is in the harbor, and tell Captain Febiger to hurry up here. I
                  must see him instantly! Say nothing more!"</p>
               <p>The servant, whose eye had glanced with a momentary horror upon the white face of
                  the corpse, hurried away, and then Ribera took possession of the account-book
                  which Febiger had brought, and after glancing at it a moment, he opened a secret
                  panel in the ceiling, and there concealed it.</p>
               <p>"I rather think our accounts are settled!" said he, as he glanced toward his
                  victim. "The man who tells Ribera that he lies, in his own house, is apt to
                     <emph>lie</emph> himself, stiff and cold, before he leaves it! And the son had
                  better keep a cool tongue between his teeth, or he'll follow in the footsteps of
                  his miserly father! But if I <emph>can</emph> keep him in play, I will, for he is
                  careless and generous, and I can make what I please out of him!"</p>
               <p>It was not long before Marcus Febiger made his appearance. When he entered the
                  room where Ribera was, he found the latter pacing to and fro, apparently in a
                  state of terrible agitation.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, my king of the Black Birds?" he cried, gailey, for, at first,
                  he did not see the corpse of his father.</p>
               <p>"Look there!" said Ribera, pointing to the body. "Mr. Febiger came in, apparently
                  choking with anger, and before he had been in half a minute, or spoken five words,
                  he fell in a fit, and died almost instantly. I knew that it was useless to call in
                  a physician, so sent for you!"</p>
               <p>"You must call a physician to certify to the cause of his death—he always was <choice>
                     <sic>apopletic</sic>
                     <corr>apoplectic</corr>
                  </choice>!" said the son, evincing no emotion whatever, and looking quite
                  unconcerned upon the mortal remains before him.</p>
               <p>Ribera at once sent for a physician, from whom he could get any kind of a
                  certificate that he desired. He was speedy in his attendance, and after a brief
                  examination of the body, and one or two inquiries about the symptoms of his
                  attack, gave a certificate without any hesitation, that he died of
                     <emph>apoplexy</emph>. A purse of gold, slipped slily into his hand, by Ribera,
                  rewarded him, and he departed.</p>
               <p>"I presume that you will have the body removed to New York, for interment!" said
                  Ribera. "A leaden coffin will preserve it."</p>
               <p>"I suppose that I <emph>must!</emph>" said Marcus, "just for the looks of the
                  thing—though I don't care where he lays! His stepping out leaves <emph>me</emph>
                  independent!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, very rich, but yet you'd like to be richer, wouldn't you?"</p>
               <p>"Of course; for I'm going to make money fly now, I can tell you!"</p>
               <p>"Then you had better leave your father's deposits in my hands for the
                  present—they're invested in 'my black bird line,' and will realize immense profits
                  this season!"</p>
               <p>"Well, I'm agreed—but, Ribera, do me a favor!"</p>
               <p>"What is it, my dear friend? Be assured I shall comply with your request; name
                  your desire!"</p>
               <p>"Just pack the old man up right, and ship him home, to New York, by the first
                  packet. I wouldn't have his corpse on board of the Belladonna for a dozen times
                  its weight in gold!"</p>
               <p>"It shall be done as you desire—won't you take a little something to strengthen
                  you under this trial?"</p>
               <p>"Don't care if I do, if it is good and strong!" replied the feelingless son, in a
                  careless manner.</p>
               <p>Brandy was brought and drank freely by both, while yet the corps of the murdered
                  man lay before them.</p>
               <p>"Are you going to make any further search for the child?" asked Ribera, after they
                  had imbibed.</p>
               <p>"No—blast it, no! Not at present, at least, for I've enough to come and go on for
                  years! If she don't turn up again, I'll have her property at any rate, and that's
                  all that we have ever cared for!"</p>
               <p>"When will you go back to New York?"</p>
               <p>"Right away, so as to be ready to receive the old man's body, and have a grand
                  funeral! That'll have to be done to satisfy the world, you know, though it's all
                  humbug—throwing money away which might be spent to a better purpose!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I wouldn't begrudge him a handsome burial. He leaves you possessed of ample
                  means!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed! He wasn't such a bloody old fool as to leave half his fortune to
                  build up hospitals, or colleges, or orphan asylums. He knew too much for that. He
                  knew that I could take better care of his money than all that would come to. But,
                  good day—I must go aboard and tell my wife that she has lost her daddy-in-law. Got
                  to break it easy, too, for she's a kind of nervous delicate bit of womanity! See
                  to the packing up of <emph>him</emph> as soon as possible!"</p>
               <p>Humming an old sea-song, the heartless son went off, leaving even Ribera shocked
                  at his levity and want of feeling</p>

               <p>With pomp and parade, such as wealth always can <unclear>command in</unclear> the
                  great city—with a lengthened train of <hi rend="i"/>mourners (?) in gorgeous
                  carriages, following a splendid hearse, drawn by plumed horses, all that was
                  mortal of Febiger, the victim of "<hi rend="i"/>apoplexy," was entombed, amid the
                  monuments of Greenwood. And over his grave a lofty monument was reared to
                  commemerate his virtues—<emph>his</emph> virtues, even those which the hired
                  priest had so eulogised in his eloquent and carefully written funeral sermon.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>His</emph> virtues! What were they? Those of many another millionaire who
                  counts his ill-gotten gold in our midst. To break the laws of God and man—to cheat
                  the rich and wrong the poor—to rob the orphan and swell the widow's brimming cup
                  of grief. Oh! holy man of God dilate upon <emph>his</emph> virtues—let the gilded

               </p>
               <p>Yes, the father of Marcus Febiger, with all due form and ceremony, had been
                  deposited in sanctified ground, for unsanctified worms to make banquet of, and
                  now, sole master of his ancestoral halls, the son and heir to almost countless
                  wealth was laying his plans to spend his riches and "enjoy life."</p>
               <p>We will pay him a visit. He is engaged with Mr. Blacking, so long his father's
                  ready and <choice>
                     <sic>uscrupulous</sic>

                  </choice> tool and legal adviser, in looking over his father's will, papers,
                  &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"So you say, that in this chest everything, deeds, titles, accounts, memorandums
                  of stocks, &amp;c., are deposited!" said Marcus, pointing to a massive iron chest,
                  which was enclosed in a vault or safe, built in the wall of the room in which they
                  sat.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," replied Blacking; "he arranged everything with his own hands before he
                  sat out upon his voyage. Little did I dream that it would be his last!"</p>
               <p>"Very well, Blacking, very well," said Marcus, at the same time filling up a
                  check. "Here is a check for the five thousand dollars he has left you in his
                  will—you can go and draw it, and needn't trouble yourself to come back again!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Sir?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I spoke plain enough, I should think, for a man of your discrimination to
                  understand me!" said Marcus, handing him the check "Draw your money and
                  leave!"</p>
               <p>"What, sir, do you discharge me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes?"</p>
               <p>"May I know what I've done to deserve this treatment?"</p>
               <p>"You've done nothing in particular, but you're a devilish old bore, and I don't
                  want you around me! Do you understand <emph>that</emph>?"</p>
               <p>"I do, sir! But I doubt whether you understand yourself!" said the lawyer,
                  bitterly. "You'll find it hard to get along without me, for I, and I only,
                  thoroughly understand your late father's business!"</p>
               <p>"I'll risk it! And I want no more words. You can pack up your duds and leave!"</p>
               <p>"Marcus Febiger!" said the lawyer, rising, "I will <emph>go</emph>, but mark you,
                  by this meanness and ingratitude, you have made an enemy who will drag
                     <emph>thousands</emph> from your coffers! I neither fear or respect you, but
                  I'll make you regret this hour to the end of your life. Your secrets are no
                  secrets to me, and I'll use them!"</p>
               <p>Before Febiger could recover from the surprise which this boldness, in the usually
                  humble lawyer, had occasioned, he was alone Blacking had left.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
               <p>"How are you, Mr. Queer—how are you? You are just the man I was looking for!"
                  cried Mr. Blacking, as, after drawing his money from the bank, he espied the
                  former personage sauntering with a thoughtful air along Wall street, looking as if
                  he was pondering over some weighty financial undertaking.</p>
               <p>The truth was, that Mr. Queer had two ways of showing <emph>his</emph> business
                  importance in that thoroughfare of Mammon—two entire suits of appearance to wear.
                  One was the air studious and abstractive, in which we now find him; the other was
                  air hurried—a rushing along the street as if the old boy was after him, and he had
                  no place to hide in. Meet him when he wore the first air—he would say, in the
                  politest manner:</p>
               <p>"I beg you not to disturb me at present, my dear sir—I have a very heavy
                  transaction before me, and am giving it my most serious consideration!"</p>
               <p>If he wore the other air, and you interrupted him, he would say:</p>
               <p>"Don't detain me, I pray, my dear sir! I have thirty thousand to raise for a
                  friend before the bank closes, and am in great haste!"</p>
               <p>And yet the amount of his study and his haste, was all in his "mind's eye,
                  Horatio."</p>
               <p>Looking up, when he was addressed, and seeing Blacking, whom he had known as the
                  "legal man" of the wealthy Febiger's, and seeing also the large roll of bills
                  which the lawyer was stowing away in a huge pocketbook, Queer at once emerged from
                  his abstractedness, put his head out of his shell like a hawk's-billed turtle, and
                  with a baboonish smile upon his smooth face, said:</p>
               <p>"Ah, my <emph>dear</emph> Mr. Blacking, how <emph>do</emph> you do! What a sad
                  affair that was—the death of Mr. Febiger, Senior—so sudden, poor fellow! The last
                  time I had the honor to take wine with him his mind seemed depressed. Some poet,
                  either Milton, or Sir Walter Smollet, or Thomas Howard Paine, or Fenimore
                  Dickens—I forget which, for I read but little now, except stock, and bank, and
                  railroad reports—says that 'coming events sends shadows 'fore 'em;' and I think
                  that even then he was looking through his soul's eyes at the shadow of death!
                  Don't you, Mr. Blacking?"</p>
               <p>"If he <emph>had</emph> a soul, which I very much doubt!" said Mr. Blacking,
                  putting his pocketbook away, and buttoning his coat over it, as if to shut it out
                  from the greedy grasps of the world's hyenas.</p>
               <p>"Why, you were on the best of terms with him, were you not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, as a handsome legacy, which he has left me, will prove! But it was because I
                  was <emph>necessary</emph> to him—not that he loved me! He never loved
                     <emph>any</emph> one! His heart was as dry as a burned bone. But he was better
                  than his son! He is a mean, dirty scoundrel!"</p>
               <p>"What! have you quarreled with <emph>him</emph>?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and left him! I wouldn't do <emph>his</emph> business for twenty thousand a
                  year! But I'll cost him more than that. I know every secret of his father's and
                  his, and I'll teach him a lesson, which, while it satisfies my hate, will also
                  fill my pockets!"</p>
               <p>"I'm glad to hear of it!" said Queer—"glad to hear of it, for he insulted me the
                  last time I met him! Let us go into the Tontine and sample their liquor, and then
                  we'll have a talk about this matter, for I'm with you heart and hand!"</p>
               <p>The lawyer, though usually very abstemious, was not now in a humor to refuse the
                  invitation, the more especially that he wanted to make <emph>use</emph> of Mr.
                  Queer, as will hereinafter appear. Therefore, arm in arm, the two "worthies"
                  departed for that ancient "place of spirits," and there <emph>imbibed</emph>.</p>
               <p>"I believe that you were acquainted with Miss Ione, the late Mr. Febiger's niece
                  and ward!" said Blacking, after he had wiped his lips with a yellow bandanna
                  handkerchief.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Queer, "slightly with <emph>her</emph>, but most intimately with
                  her father, his half-brother, who was his superior in every way. Poor Sinclair! he
                  was a noble fellow—knew how to make money, and could save it, too, without being
                  miserly at that!"</p>
               <p>"I suppose that you did not know that she was married?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I did—I found it out the other day in looking over the court record, and
                  then I knew why young Febiger insulted me, and why the old man got mad, when I
                  asked about her. He said she was off on a visit to her southern relations!"</p>
               <p>"She is dead!"</p>
               <p>"Dead? Good God! you do not mean it?"</p>
               <p>"I do—I <emph>saw her killed!</emph> Marcus Febiger was her murderer!"</p>
               <p>"Heaven's and earth! Why don't you have him arrested,
                  tried—<emph>hung</emph>—curse him—HUNG!"</p>
               <p>"It is not time yet, Mr. Queer—but the time will come—<emph>will come!</emph> She
                  has a child!"</p>
               <p>"Living?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and in the care of its father!"</p>
               <p>"What is <emph>his</emph> name?"</p>
               <p>"That I must withhold from you, at present. It is a name not unknown in this city,
                  or throughout the land. But, my dear Mr. Queer. I have something for
                     <emph>you</emph> to do—a proposal to make—which shall result favorably to
                     <emph>your</emph> fortunes as sure as I live?"</p>
               <p>"Name it, my <emph>dear</emph> Mr. Blacking—name it—<emph>I am your
                  man!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"It is that, in my absence—for I am going to seek the child and its father, and
                  let him know what his rights are; for I have the original will of Ione's father in
                  my own possession, besides some other documents, which will make Master Marcus
                  howl yet—that in my absence. I repeat, you will keep your eye upon all of his
                  movements, and report to me. I have sworn to work his ruin, and I will. I pity his
                  young wife, but she will not stay long with him. I can perceive that she already
                  is becoming sickened and disgusted with his rude vulgarity and drunken
                  debaucheries!"</p>
               <p>"My <emph>very</emph> dear Mr. Blacking, you could not put your trust in one who
                  will be more faithful than your humble servant, even though the statement emanates
                  from my own lips. I'll watch him as a cat watches a rat that has been guilty of
                  cheesi-larceny and other crimes! I feel more than a pecuniary interest in the
                  matter—Sinclair was my best friend. That infernal scoundrel ought to hang—to
                     <emph>hang</emph>, sir, for murdering his daughter!"</p>
               <p>"Quietly, Mr. Queer—quietly! As I remarked before, his time <emph>will</emph>
                  come! But our hand musn't be shown yet. We must lessen his wealth, and get him
                  entirely in our power before a living soul knows what we know now!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, I see!"</p>
               <p>"And now, Mr. Queer let us go and seal our covenant over another 'sample' of the
                  Tontine brandy!"</p>
               <p>"With all my heart, my dear sir—with all my heart!"</p>
               <p>"Before I go south, I will give you full directions in writing, for your
                  instruction, how to act, and also how to address me!" said the lawyer, as they
                  entered the Tontine.</p>
               <p>"So do, my dear sir; so do!" replied Queer.</p>
               <p>As he held his glass in his hand, the broker said</p>
               <p>"How singular, that right here, where we stand, making a covenant of united
                  warfare against <emph>him</emph>, Marcus Febiger should have insulted me—called me
                  harsh names, and told me that if he had been at home when I asked his father
                  questions about Ione, he would have had his niggers kick me—<emph>me</emph>, Amasa
                  Queer, broker, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">et cetera, et cetera</foreign>, out of
                  doors!"</p>
               <p>"Insolent! and yet he is just the man to put such a threat into execution!" said
                  the lawyer, tipping his glass.</p>
               <p>"He'll never have the chance!" said Queer, as he also inverted his glass.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
               <p>Reader, are you <emph>scary?</emph> If not, leap with me through twenty years of
                  the fog of time—shut your eyes, for it is a long jump—and let the incidents of
                  those twenty years be as nought to us, except when as reminiscences, they may
                  arise in dim and shadowy shape in future pages of our story.</p>
               <p>Who is that lovely girl, standing there beneath the broad spreading limbs of the
                  evergreen live-oaks, orange-blossoms in the jet-black tresses which flow glossily
                  over her white shoulders? Her tall and stately form is <emph>symmetry
                     itself;</emph>; her dress, fashioned gracefully to <emph>fit,</emph> and not to
                  improve, the form, is very elegant; her beauty never was equaled in monarch's
                  court or peasant's cot. Who is she, standing there, so like an angel, while the
                  dusky forms of a swarthier race are seen hovering around, gazing with respect,
                  mingled with love and awe, upon her?</p>
               <p>A tall and stately-looking man advances, whose face, though darkened by exposure
                  in a tropic clime, tells that he, too, is of the pale-faced race. His hair and
                  beard, both white as the drifting snow, are very long—his mien is serene and
                  majestic. The red children of the forest look upon him with reverence as he
                  passes, for they think that he holds converse with the "Great Spirit"—they know
                  that he is a powerful Medicine-man, and they believe that, with a prophetic eye,
                  he can look into the future. Who is he, you ask?</p>
               <p>It is Arpiaka, the "White Wizard" and the great prophet of the Seminoles.</p>
               <p>And the lady, she who gazes out upon the grassy ocean of the everglades, from her
                  lovely island-home, is ONA, the cherub-child, grown into the angel-woman.</p>
               <p>How very beautiful; her great black eyes, so full of light, yet so passionless and
                  pure—her tall form so queenly—she looks like one made to be worshiped, not
                     <emph>loved</emph> as frail mortals love.</p>
               <p>"Where do your thoughts wander, dear daughter?" asked Arpiaka, as he advanced to
                  her side. "To that glittering outside world, of which you have read so much from
                  my books, and whose enchantments, as well as its evils. I have ever laid before
                  you, freely, in our daily converse? Do you sigh to be <emph>in</emph> that world,
                  mistress of the fortune which there awaits you, queen of fashion, and with your
                  beauty, to have the things which men call <emph>hearts,</emph> cast at your
                  feet?"</p>
               <p>"Father, <emph>dear</emph> father, such jests are cruel! You know that there is no
                  world which I desire, but that in which <emph>you</emph> dwell. I am sure that you
                  jest!"</p>
               <p>"You know that I never jest, my child. But I have noted that, very oft of late,
                  you wander away from our lodge—wander listlessly away—and stand for hours gazing
                  out upon the green grass-fields, or upon the dancing waters, or up at the driving
                  clouds, which in wild, fantastic forms sweep darkly athwart the sky!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, father! Well, I am only dreaming then. You know that my mind is full of
                  strange fancies. I love to look upon the green glades, and watch the fleeting
                  shades which darken, fade, and brighten on the bending grass. I love to look upon
                  the dancing waters, which, like jewels in motion, leap up to welcome the glad
                  sunlight and the merry breeze. I love to watch the driving clouds, for they assume
                  many a shape, which seems like a spirit-form overlooking the earth. Chide me not,
                  dear father, for these fancies! You have given me that, which those around us have
                  not, an education, which has taught me to know that I have a mind, and with it to
                  study, to reflect, and to wander away into the fanciful realms of thought. Had you
                  left me in ignorance, as they are, I should not look above their level,
                  perhaps—might enjoy their wild sports, and even listen to the wooing of the
                  noblest of them all, poor Osceola!"</p>
               <p>"You <emph>pity</emph> him, Ona?" and as he said this, Arpiaka regarded her
                  closely, as if he would read the expression of her thoughts in her <choice>
                     <sic>countenace</sic>
                     <corr>countenance</corr>
                  </choice>. But there was no change there, as she frankly answered:</p>
               <p>"<emph>I do,</emph> sincerely, my father. He has many noble traits. He is bold and
                  haughty among his own people, but to me, as humble as if I were a queen and he my
                  slave. Yet there is a stern pride in his very humility. Once, and once only, has
                  he spoken of his love; then I bade him speak of it no more, and his lips have been
                  closed ever since, though his eloquent eye and sunken check have revealed how he
                  suffers. Not so with Coacooche! He is almost insolent in his advances, though I
                  have spurned him from me in scorn; and were you not near, even armed as I always
                  go, I would fear him. He is as wily, as remorseless, and as treacherous as a snake
                  in the grass, which, with venomed fang, lays ready to strike from its
                  concealment!"</p>
               <p>"He is a bad man, and my eye is upon him!" said Arpiaka. "But soon he will have
                  enough upon his hands to turn his thoughts from you. A war with the whites is
                  inevitable. They have, for years, been so wronging our poor Seminoles, that
                  retaliation is a necessity. I, who have restrained them so long, by my counsel and
                  prophecies, can do so no longer. For my own sake, if I would still hold the power
                  which has given me such influence, and secured to me so many brave adherents, who
                  know no other chief than their prophet, I must urge them on, rather than keep them
                  back, hoping, that, fortified as they are by the hands of nature, in their
                  pathless swamps and trackless glades, they can secure such terms of peace,
                  eventually, as will leave them in quiet hereafter!"</p>
               <p>"You will not join in this war against your own race, my father?"</p>
               <p>"In person <emph>no</emph>—in <emph>heart</emph>, yes, Ona. I <emph>never</emph>
                  will desert this brave and noble tribe. When my own race wronged me, and pursued
                  me to the death, they received, protected me. Now I stand second to none, not even
                  Micanopee! To me they look as almost to a god. They heed my counsels, and when
                  they think that I talk with the Great Spirit, they are awestruck and they
                  tremble!"</p>
               <p>"Who will lead the tribes to battle?" asked Ona.</p>
               <p>"Osceola, the bravest chieftain of them all. Micanopee is old, and his arm is
                  weak, but he has chosen Osceola to fill his place! But I must back to the lodge;
                  for a council is to be held, and they will be dumb until Arpiaka speaks!"</p>
               <p>The "Prophet" strode slowly away, but Ona did not move. She seemed lost in
                  troubled thought.</p>
               <p>"War is dreadful!" she murmured; "terrible in its cruelties—so say the books which
                  I have read. I wish that I could see Osceola. I would pray him to be merciful, and
                  I know that he would heed me!"</p>
               <p>"Osceola is here, and his ears are open to the words of the White Dove!" said a
                  deep-toned voice near her, and she turned and beheld him of whom she had spoken
                  aloud.</p>
               <p>And he looked one of nature's noblemen, that dauntless warrior, as he stood by the
                  rough trunk of a gnarled oak, leaning upon his trusty rifle, his knife and hatchet
                  girdled to his tall, erect form, his plumed turban overhanging his high, clear
                  brow. He was paler than the generality of the red warriors; for he was Indian only
                  on his mother's side—his father was a pale-face—one of that race who, with
                  Wallace, struggled for freedom, in vain, among Scotia's lofty highlands. And the
                  expression of his countenance was noble, intellectual, and candid. <emph>He</emph>
                  was no "snake in the grass."</p>
               <p>"Osceola, you are soon going to war!"</p>
               <p>"The White Dove has spoken the truth!"</p>
               <p>"Will you do me a favor, Osceola?"</p>
               <p>"I would <emph>die</emph> for the White Dove!"</p>
               <p>"I do not ask thy death, brave Osceola, but pray the Great Spirit long to spare
                  thee. That which I ask is, when this terrible war begins, be thou merciful. War
                  not upon poor helpless women and children, and spare defenceless old age. Strike
                  where warriors strike, but bid thy braves strike none <emph>but</emph>
                  warriors!"</p>
               <p>"The <emph>will</emph> of the White Dove is the <emph>law</emph> of Osceola!" and
                  with a grace which many a plumed courtier could not have equaled, the chief bowed
                  low toward the ground. Then, plucking a magnolia from a tree close by—the emblem
                  of <emph>pure</emph> love—he placed it in her hand, and, without another word,
                  departed to join the council of the chiefs.</p>
               <p>"Poor Osceola—I pity, but I cannot love him!" murmured Ona, as she looked at the
                  fragrant flower.</p>
               <p>"Why do you not love a warrior, a great brave, then?" said a harsh voice, and an
                  Indian, smaller in stature than the other, but well formed, and full of activity
                  and muscle, but whose face indicated a heart full of bad passions, and a
                  malignant, desperate, and cruel disposition, stepped from behind a neighboring
                  tree.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Coacoochee, a spy and a listener!" said the maiden, in a scornful
                  tone. And, without awaiting his reply, she turned haughtily away, and walked
                  toward her father's lodge.</p>
               <p>"Osceola shall die, and the White Dove shall yet be mine!" he muttered, and he
                  gnashed his teeth in anger, as he watched her receding figure.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
               <p>On Arpiaka's Island—for the large and fertile spot where he and his especial
                  adherents dwelt, amid fields of corn, melons, fruits, sugar cane, etc., was
                  regarded as his own—a grand council was being held by the principal chiefs and
                  braves of the Seminole tribe. It was held, not now to consider grievances and
                  petition the United States government for redress and protection, as had been the
                  case with previous councils, but to consider how and where to strike the heaviest
                  and deadliest blows against the forces which that government had sent into their
                  territories, to destroy their fields, occupy their hunting-grounds, slay their
                  warriors and make captive their wives and little ones.</p>
               <p>Micanopee was not there; he was getting too old to leave his village, but he had
                  sent his chieftains to counsel with Arpiaka, for he had confidence in the wisdom
                  of the prophet, and in his devotion to his adopted brethren. Osceola, Chitte
                  Emathla, Uchee Lajo, Kialatah, all great braves and noted chiefs, were present;
                  and, just as Arpiaka rose to speak, Coacoochee entered, with a dark and gloomy
                  face, a hateful sneer yet lingering there; for his heart was bitter in that he had
                  been so scorned by Ona.</p>
               <p>When Arpiaka rose, every warrior in the great circular lodge was still as
                  death—their eyes, which had centred upon the council fire which blazed in their
                  midst, were now fixed upon him, and their ears were opened to his words.</p>
               <p>"Brothers!" said he, speaking in their own tongue, with fluency and correctness,
                  "you have come to me for counsel! I have talked with the Great Spirit, and the
                  words of truth and of prophecy will fall from my lips. Take heed to them. You have
                  been forced to dig up the war-knife. It is rusty. It must be brightened upon the
                  bones of your oppressors!"</p>
               <p>Arpiaka paused, and sounds of approval passed from lip to lip along the dusky
                  circle. He continued:</p>
               <p>"Already their warriors tread along your hunting-grounds. Their great guns thunder
                  at sunrise and at sunset over the graves of your fathers! And they hold you in
                  scorn, for they think you do not know how to fight; that <emph>they</emph> only
                  understand the science of the trade. But the Great Spirit has whispered to me that
                  you will teach them better. Yes"—and his voice rose and his eyes flashed, and his
                  whole being seemed inspired—"yes, I see your first battle. You lay concealed in
                  the thick bushes and in the tall grass. The pale-faced army is marching through
                  the pine-barren—their chiefs, in glittering uniforms, ride carelessly in the van,
                  their warriors follow wearily on foot, and their big guns lumber along in the
                  rear. They near the well-formed ambuscade. Suddenly Osceola's war-cry rends the
                  air, and he sends a bullet to the pale-faced leader's heart. And quick as
                  lightning flashes from the cloud, each warrior picks his foe, and sends death home
                  to him while the war-cries ring loud and far. Confused,' in terror, the pale faces
                  fall back and build a breastwork. But ere that is done, not one in ten remain
                  alive to defend it. And they fall one by one, while no red man is touched, either
                  by the balls of their great guns or the fire of their musketry, for the pale-faces
                  cannot see where the red men are, and they throw their shots away! Soon the last
                  one falls, and then the cry of victory rings high and loud from Osceola's lips. It
                  is echoed by his braves, not one of whom has fallen. And there lay the pale-faces
                  ready for the scalping knife? The Great Spirit has shown me <emph>this</emph>, my
                  brothers, and it will come to pass!" <ref rend="super" target="#note_004"

               </note>
               <p>Not now a mere murmur of approval came from that fierce and excitable band, the
                  war-whoop, swelling louder and louder, until it was almost deafening, came from
                  every chieftain's lip, and all as loudly and as wild it was echoed back from the
                  young braves who were gathered outside, waiting the result of the council, to
                  which they could not yet be admitted.</p>
               <p>Again, his eyes flashing more wildly still, and looking up as if he saw all that
                  he described, Arpiaka spoke:</p>
               <p>"The Great Father of the pale-faces at Washington is very angry, because his
                  warriors are falling like dry leaves before the gale. He sends an army ten times
                  as great, and a white-haired chief, a great brave, is at their head. But my red
                  brothers are not afraid. By a great lake they make their ambuscade. A deep swamp
                  is before them. Behind are the waters, but their canoes are ready to bear them
                  away when their work is done. They cut away the brush, and then make rests for
                  their rifles, so that their aim will be deadly when the foe advances. And they
                  send a squaw—one who has sense in her head and is not afraid—and she lets herself
                  be taken prisoner by the pale-faces. And when they ask her where Osceola and his
                  warriors are, she will lead them to the swamp, and say: 'There, in the woods
                  beyond, ye will find him!' And the pale-faces will rush on, on to death and
                  destruction! And when Osceola and his warriors are weary with long fighting, or
                  are pressed by numbers, they will retreat across the lake in safety. The 'Great
                  Spirit' has spoken: It will be done!" <ref rend="super" target="#note_005"

               </note>
               <p>Arpiaka ceased, and again the wild shouts of the warriors rose upon the air.</p>
               <p>"Will not Arpiaka go with us to the battle?" asked Coacooche, who hid his covert
                  malice beneath the veil of a calm countenance.</p>
               <p>"Arpiaka can see the battle from here! He will not go; but he will tell the
                  warriors where to go! He will remain, lest the speckled serpent come to steal his
                  White Dove when he is gone!" said the prophet, in a haughty tone.</p>
               <p>Coacooche, who wore the speckled skins of the southern wild-cat for his
                  hunting-shirt, understood the pointed allusion to himself; but he said no more,
                  for he feared the magic power of the Great Medicine, even more than he did the
                  angry and flashing glance of more than one warrior besides Osceola.</p>
               <p>The latter now arose and said: "The words of the Great Medicine, our father and
                  our brother, have put strength into our hearts! We will go and fight the men who
                  invade our land—we will punish our oppressors! But we will fight as men. We will
                  strike their warriors dead: but we will make no war upon their women and children!
                  I am ready for the battle! Who is not? Osceola has spoken! He is ready to lead.
                  Who fears to follow?"</p>
               <p>From every lip but one came tokens of approval. But on the face of Coacoochee, or
                  "Wild-Cat," the habitual sneer, rested and he rose to speak:</p>
               <p>The heart of Osceola has grown very tender toward women of late!" he said. "When
                  he slays the male serpent, does he spare the female that it may breed more? Or
                  does he save the young ones, that they may grow strong enough to bite?"</p>
               <p>Looks betokened that the strong similes used by the wily warrior had some effect.
                  Arpiaka saw this, and he knew that a check must at once be put upon it. He rose
                  and said:</p>
               <p>"Man and woman are made in the image of the Great Spirit. The tongue is crooked
                  and the heart is black which would liken them to the serpent! The words of Osceola
                  were good, and he who does not listen to them will be frowned upon by the Great
                  Spirit, and evil will overtake him! I have spoken!"</p>
               <p>most of them have perished or yielded, still</p>
               <p>Coacooche could say no more—he stood alone in that circle, and he knew it.</p>
               <p>The council was now dissolved, but Arpiaka took Osceola to his own lodge, where,
                  with maps of the country before him, with the skill of a great and experienced
                  captain, he laid out the plan of the coming campaign. From their scouts, they had
                  received information of the number, stations, and movements of the United States
                  forces, and from his <choice>
                     <sic>knowedge</sic>
                     <corr>knowledge</corr>
                  </choice> of the tactics of military men, Arpiaka so counseled and directed
                  Osceola in regard to his movements, that the destructive prophecies named by the
                  former, could not fail to be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Osceola listened with grave attention, for he revered and loved the father of the
                  White Dove. And he promised to obey his instructions to the minutest item.</p>
               <p>Before he went away, Ona came out from her room with a beautiful scarf, which she
                  threw over his broad shoulders and across his manly chest. The agitated warrior,
                  who never trembled before a foe, could only say that the gift of the White Dove
                  should never leave him while life was left to defend it. The scarf was crimson,
                  and upon it was worked the figure of a dove taking shelter from a serpent beneath
                  the outspread wings of an eagle.</p>
               <p>Osceola knew its meaning, and though he uttered no knightly vow, full well did the
                  fair girl know that he would defend her if it need be, while life was in him.</p>
               <p>Then, with Arpiaka's blessing, Osceola departed to rally his warriors and prepare
                  for action. Blood had already been shed—the war-cry had gone abroad, and there was
                  no time for hesitation then. An era, the commencement of a long and bloody
                  struggle, had arrived—a struggle wherein a brave and unfortunate handful, the
                  original owners of the soil, were to meet the tens of thousands, aye the
                     <emph>twenties</emph> and more, of well-armed and disciplined foemen, whose
                  oft-thinned ranks would fill as fast as they were swept away.</p>
               <p>Terrible struggle! Cruel and unjust war! Merciless persecution! Robbed of their
                  soil, their homes destroyed, their fields desolated, the graves of their ancestry
                  violated, their people shot down wherever they were found, hunted, too, by
                  blood-hounds, like savage beasts—what could they do but fight to the last for
                     <emph>revenge</emph>—nothing else was left <emph>to</emph> fight for! <ref

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
               <p>Twenty years have wrought other changes than those which we have noted in our two
                  last chapters. We will look at some other characters hitherto occupying prominent
                  positions in our story.</p>
               <p>Who are those two gentlemen, sitting hob and nob over a bachelor's dinner-table in
                  a magnificent mansion on the Fifth avenue, that grand arena of upper-snob-dom,
                  that region of retired beer-and-codfish venders, immortalised
                  by—<emph>what</emph>? Wealth linked with the inherent vulgarity of those neither
                  born, bred, or educated for the station which they would claim among the true
                  aristocracy of the land—the aristocracy of mind, of proud and ancient lineage, of
                  honor which never "stooped to conquer," or, buzzard-like, fattened upon carrion,
                  to gain strength to rise among the eagles.</p>
               <p>Who are they? Both have Time's records written in snowy lines upon their heads,
                  yet the furrows on their jovial faces have not "struck in" very deep, and there is
                  a merry twinkle in their eyes, especially in those of the fattest and eldest one,
                  which seems to say that "care has he abiding place with us!"</p>
               <p>The silver service on the table, the elegant furniture, the luxuriant board, all
                  speak of wealth and comfort; and the liveried servants so attentive and yet so
                  silent while the meats are on the table, yet who at a signal retire after desert
                  is over and leave the gentlemen to wine, cigars, and conversation, all betoken
                  that these two "old covies," whoever they are, knew how to <emph>live</emph>.</p>
               <p>"Brother Queer," said the younger of the two, "do you know that to-day is the
                  twentieth anniversary of our co-partnership, or rather our 'covenant,' made and
                  sealed at the old Tontine!"</p>
               <p>"So it is, I declare, brother Blacking—so it is! Well, well, how time hurries when
                  we get toward the end of our journey! He's like a horse with oats ahead—the nearer
                  he gets home the faster he goes!" replied the other, who was our old friend,
                  "Amasa Queer, <hi rend="i"/>broker,<foreign xml:lang="LAT">et cetera, et
                     cetera.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"But we have no reason to complain, brother Queer; time has not roughened us much,
                  and by working brotherly in our respective lines, we have amassed about as
                  handsome a fortune as any one else can afford to pay taxes on in this city of
                  official corruption."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, brother Blacking, we may say that we are comfortably well off; in fact,
                  assert it <emph>positively</emph>, and without fear of contradiction, as that
                  jolly chap, <emph>Burton</emph>, would say!"</p>
               <p>"I wonder how that rascal, Febiger, feels now?" said the lawyer. "Let me see, his
                  time at Sing Sing must be out. He was sent for ten years; he was not keen enough
                  for forgery! But it gave his poor wife a chance for a divorce, which she might
                  have had before, if she would have taken it. It beats all how some women will
                  cling to a man, even when they know him to be heartless and criminal. But it isn't
                  so with all of 'em! I know a case where the wife, though she knew in her
                     <emph>heart</emph> that her husband was innocent, let him become the victim of
                  a base conspiracy, listened to the perjuries of gamblers and courtesans, and, in
                  his darkest hours of trouble, deserted him—left him to his fate. But he rose above
                  his foes, and—she never has been a happy woman since!"</p>
               <p>"Poor thing, she should have stuck to him!" said Queer, taking another glass of
                  old wine.</p>
               <p>"A rough-looking man at the door wishes to see you, Mr. Blacking," said a servant,
                  entering.</p>
               <p>"His name?"</p>
               <p>"He would not give any, sir; but said that he must see you immediately, for his
                  business was of very great importance!"</p>
               <p>"Well, show the fellow up; it <emph>may</emph> be something that requires
                  attention."</p>
               <p>The servant retired, but soon returned, ushering in a fellow who looked rough
                  indeed. His hair close cut, and his yellowish pale face at once betokened the
                  discharged convict, while his hardened expression and look of brazen effrontery
                  did not by any means show that repentance had followed punishment.</p>
               <p>"Speak of the devil, and he is sure to turn up!" said Blacking, as he motioned the
                  servant to retire.</p>
               <p>"Marcus Febiger, as sure as I live!" said Mr. Queer, looking with disgust at the
                  ragged and filthy-looking being who stood, hat in hand—if the battered
                     <emph>tile</emph> he held could be called a <hi rend="i"/>hat—before him.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Marcus Febiger, free once more!" said that individual.</p>
               <p>"What do you want here?" asked Blacking, sternly.</p>
               <p>"Money, <emph>money!</emph>" replied the convict. "I can get no work; I don't want
                  to steal if I can help it, for they'll jug me again, and I don't like to
                  starve!"</p>
               <p>"Take that and begone!" said Blacking, and he tossed a five dollar gold piece to
                  the man.</p>
               <p>"Yes, leave the presence!" said Queer, as he threw him a ten dollar piece.</p>
               <p>The convict picked up the gold, and then said, in a bitter tone:</p>
               <p>"Erastus Blacking, is this all you are going to give me? Do you think that you are
                  now living here in clover on much that once belonged to me? Do you remember what
                  my father did for you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, he led me into rascalities which it has taken a whole after-life of honesty
                  to wipe out!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Honesty</emph>! HONESTY in a New York pettifogger!" sneered the convict.
                  "Where is Barnum?"</p>
               <p>"You had better go and see!" said Blacking, swallowing a glass of wine.</p>
               <p>"Patience a moment, good devil, and I will!" replied Febiger. "I have a couple of
                  questions to ask, and I will trouble you no more. Is there not some way by which I
                  can reach that infernal scoundrel, Ribera, who, I know, has over three millions of
                  my money, while I am penniless!"</p>
               <p>"You have no <emph>proof</emph> that he owes you a cent!"</p>
               <p>"No, you infernal scoundrel, <emph>no!</emph> You stole the papers, and I expect
                  went halves with him!" thundered the convict. "What should hinder me from
                  throttling you—<emph>you</emph>, the author of my ruin, on the spot?" And with
                  glaring eyes and flushed face the man seemed about to spring upon the lawyer.</p>
               <p>"<emph>This</emph>," replied the latter, coolly cocking a pistol, which he drew
                  from his pocket.</p>
               <p>It is astonishing how quickly some men cool down when they look into a pistol
                  barrel and know that a steady finger is on the trigger of the weapon. I have known
                  a raving bully, a duellist of the first order, a gambling assassin, to
                     <emph>subside</emph> in a second, when placed in such a situation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Febiger was calm in a moment.</p>
               <p>"Tell me, for God's sake, where is my wife and son?" he asked. "Tell me that and I
                  will go!"</p>
               <p>"You have no wife! She is divorced from you, and your son has graduated with honor
                  at West Point; and, if you have one spark of manhood left, you will trouble
                  neither of them, nor disgrace them with your presence!"</p>
               <p>"I was tried and convicted under another name; they do not know <emph>me</emph> as
                  a convict!" moaned Febiger, completely broken spirited by this last news.</p>
               <p>"She does, if he does not; you had better stick to your alias. Here are fifty
                  dollars more; try and be something now, and, if you will do for
                     <emph>yourself</emph>, I will do more for you!" said Blacking, somewhat
                  affected, when he saw tears streaming down Febiger's sallow face.</p>
               <p>"Yes, <emph>try</emph> and be a man, and <emph>we</emph> will help you! Here is a
                  hundred more!" said Queer, with a patronizing air.</p>
               <p>The convict took the money, and, half-choked with sobs, left the room.</p>
               <p>"Poor devil, I'm sorry for him!" said Queer, as he took another glass of wine and
                  lighted another cigar, for the fire in his first had been suffered to expire.</p>
               <p>"So would I be, had I not been in my poverty and helplessness so often the object
                  of his contempt and abuse!" replied Blacking.</p>
               <p>"What do you think he will do, now?" asked Queer.</p>
               <p>"Oh! I suppose he'll be like other poor devils that have fallen; probably will go
                  to the grog-shop and drink himself into a temporary forgetfulness of the past!"
                  said the lawyer, and he replenished his wine-glass and lighted another cigar, for
                  his first had also gone out.</p>

               <p>"My wife lost to me forever! No name, no honor, no friends! And penniless, except
                  the gold insultingly east at my feet by those who have robbed me? What shall I do?
                  Commit suicide? Leap madly from a hateful world into the dark abyss of which I yet
                  know nothing? No—no! 'I am not so mad as that! Shall I go to the accursed bowl
                  which has already damned me beyond hope? No, no, enough of <emph>that</emph>. But
                  I am hungry; I will go an I satisfy my appetite, and then shape my course, if
                  course there is left to me!"</p>
               <p>Thus soliloquised the wreck of the once wealthy and haughty Marcus Febiger, after
                  he had left the presence of the old bachelors, And he hurried away to an
                  eating-house, where he ate almost ravenously, for the hunger of over two days'
                  abstinence gnawed within him. After he had eaten all that he eared for, his eyes
                  wandered to the glittering and tempting bottles upon the well-stocked shelves of
                  the bar, but he mustered all of the man that was left in him, and paying only for
                  his food, turned away, muttering: "I am low enough now—<emph>it</emph> shall not
                  sink me any lower!"</p>
               <p>Strengthened in body, but weak, ah! how weak in spirit and in hope, the unhappy
                  man passed on, until, in a narrow street, in one of the poorer portions of the
                  city, his progress was checked by a crowd of men, women and boys, who had gathered
                  around a small martial band, which was playing stirring national airs, while, at
                  intervals, a sergeant, who carried a small American flag, invited recruits to
                  enlist, offering good pay, plenty to eat and drink, nice clothing, and a chance to
                  win immortal fame and promotion, or death in the swamps and glades of Florida, in
                  the ranks of the Second Dragoons—a new regiment, just formed, etc.</p>
               <p>"Who commands your company?" asked the convict.</p>
               <p>"Captain Fulton, of Company B.," said the sergeant. "Do you want to enlist, my
                  fine fellow?"</p>
               <p>"Is there a Lieutenant Febiger in your regiment?" asked the convict, trembling
                  with agitation.</p>
               <p>"Yes; he is our second lieutenant, just out of the band-box at West Point! But
                  Florida will soon take the smooth out of him. Do you want to enlist?" replied the
                  sergeant.</p>
               <p>"Yes, after I have attended to some business. Where is your recruiting
                  office?"</p>
               <p>"In Centre street, near the Park. You had better go there now."</p>
               <p>"Not yet; but I will be there in less than two hours."</p>
               <p>"Well, let me take your name down."</p>
               <p>"You can call me Marston," said Febiger, and he hurried away, muttering as he
                  went, "I will be near <emph>him</emph>. I may in battle save his life, and, if I
                  lose my own, I will lose it bravely; and, perhaps, when I am dying, he will know
                  me and not curse his father."</p>
               <p>Marcus Febiger was not <emph>all</emph> lost yet. There was still
                     <emph>some</emph> humanity left in his breast. And so there is in even the most
                  degraded, if it is only drawn out and nursed into life.</p>
               <p>After leaving the recruiting party, Febiger hurried away to a clothing store,
                  where he purchased a decent suit of plain, coarse clothing, and then he went to a
                  bathing establishment, and thoroughly cleansed himself before putting it on. From
                  this place he went to a barber's, where a good shave still further bettered his
                  appearance.</p>
               <p>Dressed as he was now, with no beard upon his face, and his hair cut short (he had
                  told his barber that it had been done while he was in the hospital with a fever),
                  he had no fear of being recognized by any of his former associates, or even his
                  son, whom he had not seen since he was a young boy. After strolling around the
                  street a while, and eating another hearty meal, and taking a couple of glasses of
                  ale to give him strength and confidence, he repaired to the recruiting office.</p>
               <p>There he was met by the same sergeant, who at first did not recognize him, so much
                  had he been improved by his ablutions and change of apparel. But when he mentioned
                  the name of Marston the sergeant was delighted.</p>
               <p>"I was afraid you had slipped your promise," said he. "But I see what you've been
                  doing—been trimming up, so as to come into the company in shape? 'Twas an
                  excellent idea. There is nothing like making a fair start. If you are steady and
                  good at drill, you'll have the <hi rend="i"/>chevrous<ref rend="super"

                  Febiger and the surgeon are in there, and we'll have you examined and enlisted in

                  trembling with agitation, he followed the sergeant, and in another moment stood
                  before his own son.</p>
               <p>"Another recruit, eh, sergeant?" said the noble-looking young officer, as the two
                  stood before him.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, and a good one. Six feet, full, and as straight as an
                  arrow—full-chested and good muscle. He's been sick, he tells me, and is a little
                  pale now, but the color will soon come to his face. He is clean and neat as a pin
                  in his dress, and that's the best signs for a good soldier!"</p>
               <p>"A very fair specimen—good eyes, plenty of devil in him when he's woke up!" said
                  the surgeon, walking around him, and examining "his points," as a jockey would do
                  before he bargained for a horse.</p>
               <p>"Your name?" asked young Febiger, carelessly.</p>
               <p>"Frank Marston, sir!" replied the recruit, who had partially recovered his
                  composure.</p>
               <p>"Have you ever seen service?"</p>
               <p>"Some, sir, afloat; but I wish to see more, and there seems a good opening in this
                  war with the Indians!"</p>
               <p>"Yes. Surgeon Hammerslee, do you think he'll do?"</p>
               <p>"Yes!" replied the latter, after he had made the recruit step briskly about,
                  punched him in the chest, and about the loins and kidneys a few times, to see if
                  he was sound. "Yes, he'll pass!"</p>
               <p>The oath of service was administered, the recruit signed his name in a bold, free
                  hand, and he was fully enlisted for four years in the Second Regiment U. S.
                  Dragoons—Twiggs, Colonel, and Harney, Lieutenant-Colonel.</p>
               <p>The young officer now tendered the usual bounty to the recruit; but Marston
                  refused it, saying that he had plenty of money, and handing the officer one
                  hundred dollars, he begged him to keep it for him until he should need it.</p>
               <p>"From your language, I should judge that you had seen better days," said the
                  officer, who begun to feel a deep interest, for which he could scarcely account,
                  in the recruit.</p>
               <p>"I have been worth millions, sir, but I hope to see my <emph>best days</emph>
                  yet!" replied Mars ton. "But, sir, I have two favors to ask?"</p>
               <p>"Name them, and if not out of my power, I will grant them!" replied the young
                  officer.</p>
               <p>"The first is, that I may not be questioned about the past. The other, that I may
                  always remain attached to your company!"</p>
               <p>"Both are simple, and shall be granted!" said the lieutenant. "Go, now, with
                  Sergeant Swart, and he'll fit you with uniforms." If none fit you perfectly, the
                  company tailor will alter them to suit you!"</p>
               <p>The business was over, and Marston felt relieved when he was again alone with the
                  sergeant, for it was hard to be composed in the presence of his son.</p>
               <p>"Suppose we go out and take a glass of something strong, to wet your enlistment!"
                  said the sergeant.</p>
               <p>"No, sir, thank you!" replied Marston, firmly. "Liquor has done enough evil for me
                  already! I will never give it another chance!"</p>
               <p>"You're in for promotion, <emph>sure</emph>!" said the sergeant. "Though I take a
                  drop occasionally, those get along far the best who take none at all!"</p>

               <p>A lady, middle-aged, pale, yet with much beauty in her countenance, dressed in
                  deep mourning, sat in a well-furnished room, her appearance and attitude, for she
                  sat in an easy "reclining chair," indicating that she was an invalid. Books upon a
                  table within her reach showed that she was not alone, for who, with a mind, is
                  companionless when books are near!</p>
               <p>A knock at the door aroused her from a revery, in which she seemed buried, and her
                  voice gently uttered the words, "Come in!"</p>
               <p>A young officer, dressed in the rich uniform of the dragoons, replied to the
                  invitation, and hurrying to her side, pressed his lips to her brow fondly, and
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Dear mother, how do you feel to-day!"</p>
               <p>"As well, my dear Clarence, as usual!" she replied, taking one of his hands
                  between both of hers, and retaining it, while he sat down before her.</p>
               <p>"Which, alas, is never very well, my mother," said he, sadly.</p>
               <p>"I am better when you are near me, my brave, my noble boy!" said she. "You cannot
                  tell how I dread to have you go to Florida. I fear that I shall lose you forever,
                  either by disease, or the fatal Indian ballet!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, my mother, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma chere mere</foreign>, dismiss such idle
                  fears from your bosom. My country has educated me, and it is right that I should
                  serve her in return!" replied he, in a playful tone.</p>
               <p>"No need had you, my son, to ask an education at your country's hands. My fortune
                  has ever been ample for all of our requirements, an I now, the death of your
                  grandfather. Allsop, his left me beyond the reach of <emph>all</emph>
                  contingencies, so far as money is concerned! I almost wish you would resign!"</p>
               <p>"You would not ask me to dishonor myself, mother?" he said, in a tone that was
                  almost reproachful. "My comrades would brand me with cowardice if I resigned in
                  wartime, while under orders to join my regiment!"</p>
               <p>"Yet how unjustly. They cannot feel a mother's love, a mother's fears. But I will
                  not urge you against your wishes, my dear Clarence. I feared this, when I
                  consented, at your earnest entreaties, to let you go to West Point. But there was
                  no war, or prospect of war, then!"</p>
               <p>"Cheer up, my sweet mother! I will soon return, and I will win honor to my
                  name!"</p>
               <p>"Alas, it needs it, my son, for thou art the only Febiger who ever did honor to
                  the name. Thy <emph>father</emph>—but no, I will not speak or think of him. He is
                  dead to me and to you, even though he may be living. When do you go, my son?"</p>
               <p>"Very soon now, mother—our company is nearly full. We only lack six or eight of a
                  full complement, and Captain Fulton, who is an ardent, noble-souled Virginian, is
                  anxious to be in the field!"</p>
               <p>"Well, God's blessing go with you whenever we <emph>must</emph> part, Clarence; my
                  prayers will rise constantly toward high heaven for your safety!"</p>
               <p>"And you must be cheerful, mother. Do not fret and pine, but live and hope for me;
                  grow young again, and be my own pretty mother, whose cheeks I used to pinch to
                  make them rosy!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Dear</emph> Clarence, you would draw a smile from me if I were dying!"</p>
               <p>And the fond mother pressed her gallant son to her bosom, and, though tears were
                  falling from her eyes, she smiled through the shower, and tenderly kissed his yet
                  unbearded cheek.</p>
               <p>I would linger o'er this scene, for <emph>I</emph> had an angel mother once, who
                  blessed <emph>me</emph> thus, when she gave me to my country's cause!—alas! the
                  green turf lays heavy o'er her now—but I cannot. On, like unresisting Time, my pen
                  must travel—for the journey is yet <unclear>long</unclear> before it.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
               <p>A long military cavalcade was winding through the piny barrens of middle Florida.
                  At times, when crossing thick swamps, or passing through tangled "hammocks," the
                  line would close up and preserve <emph>some</emph> order; but, as a general thing,
                  especially in the open pine woods, the column straggled on, its leader acting with
                  an indifference that was almost criminal in an enemy's country.</p>
               <p>The officers all rode together at the head of the column instead of being with
                  their companies, and the cannon, which should have been there, was dragged lazily
                  along in the rear. And this was because their leader, confident in the bravery of
                  his men and his own military skill, held the Indians in contempt, and with his
                  small force thought that he could easily march from one end of the country to the
                  other.</p>
               <p>Fatal confidence! It was that which ruined Braddock, and, brave leader, it may
                  ruin thee!</p>
               <p>Repeatedly did the experienced guide and old hunter, engaged to show them the
                  route, ride up to the leader and say:</p>
               <p>"Major Dade, hadn't the men better keep in better order, I have seen Indian signs
                  for some time?"</p>
               <p>"Captain Eagan, do <emph>you</emph> attend to your business and I will to
                     <emph>mine</emph>," was the curt, but not over courteous, reply which he
                  received</p>
               <p>"If you run your head into a hornet's nest, it's no work of mine!" growled the old
                  woodsman, more than once, when he was thus rebuked.</p>
               <p>The day was quite far advanced, and the men began to lag wearily, and to scatter
                  more than ever. They were moving on through an open pine barren, skirting close
                  along by a small prairie of high grass, interspersed with clumps of the low,
                  saw-palmetto.</p>
               <p>"Are we not near a good camping-place, Captain Eagan?" asked the commander of his
                  guide. "The men are very tired!"</p>
               <p>"I'm afeard that a good many of them will lay down without camping, major!" said
                  the guide, who was ahead, and who had halted at a little open sandy spot. "Look
                  there—do you see them moccasin tracks? I tell you that the red devils are thick
                  around us, yet you send out no scouts or flankers, take no precautions for the
                  safety of yourself or men!"</p>
               <p>"If I had known that you was such a stickler for <emph>safety</emph>, I would not
                  have brought you from Tampa!" said the major, with a sneer.</p>
               <p>Those were the last words that the rush and unfortunate officer ever spoke. The
                  sound of a single rifle shot, one wild and terrible yell reached his ear at the
                  same moment that a bullet entered his heart.</p>
               <p>"Form, men, form! Forward with the six-pounder!" shouted the next in command, but
                  from that moment no orders could be heard. Thicker than hail came to bullets of
                  the unseen foe, and every officer in the van, with one exception, fell at that
                  first terrible fire. Yell rose on yell, thicker and faster flew the missiles of
                  death, the soldiers dropped on every hand, and yet no red man could be seen. The
                  surviving officer, an assistant surgeon, retreated with the few men who were left,
                  a little ways back among the pines, and, gathering up a few logs, tried to form a
                  low breastwork, and got his piece of artillery into position. Four or five shots
                  were fired from this, but without any effect, and in a few moments the gallant
                  officer fell with his death wound. The rest of the men tried to fly, but were shot
                  down in their tracks, and in less than a half-hour all lay stark upon the ground,
                  who had been so full of life, so gay and careless before.</p>
               <p>Then loud rung Osceola's shout of victory, echoed by his braves, and the name of
                  Arpiaka was heard on every hand, for his first prophecy had been fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Leaving to the negroes, and other followers as base, the usual work of stripping
                  the dead, Osceola and his braves took the arms and ammunition of the fallen
                  pale-faces, and departed to prepare for other battles.</p>
               <p>It was soon night, and the despoilers of the dead were obliged to desist until
                  morning. And under cover of the night, three of the men, terribly wounded, crept
                  from amid the heap of slain, and <emph>two</emph> of them, after unheard of
                  sufferings, reached the military outposts, and lived to tell the fate of their
                  comrades.</p>
               <p>They have passed away; but yet you will often hear the tale from quivering lips of
                  "Dade's massacre"—hear it told as I, who have been upon the battle-ground, have
                  described it.</p>
               <p>Some historians say that Mieanopee was there, but they err—he was too old, and
                  never fired a gun in that war.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
               <p>Yet another battle must be described. It was Christmas morn, a few weeks later
                  than the fatal day when Dade perished with his command. And yet amid fragrant
                  flowers and trees, whose green was all unfading, an army, consisting of several
                  regiments, moved on in solid column. A portion of this body consisted of southern
                  volunteers, hot-blooded, rash, but illy disciplined, as their after conduct
                  showed; but the master-spirit of the command, a short, thick-set man, both "rough
                  and ready" in his looks, held them in control.</p>
               <p>He, the leader, rode in front with his adjutant and aids, every company officer as
                  well as regimental <unclear>being</unclear> in his place. And with him, under
                  close guard, was a squaw, mounted upon a lithe little pony, who, after a most
                  ludicrous chase of several miles upon the night before, had been captured by some
                  of the mounted volunteers. <emph>Apparently</emph> very much terrified and under
                  fear of death, she had told the leader that a-large body of Indians, under the
                  famed Osceola, was encamped upon the borders of the great lake Okochobee, only a
                  few miles distant. And by threats of punishment if she did <emph>not,</emph> and
                  of rich rewards if she <emph>did,</emph> the leader had wrung from her an
                  apparently unwilling consent to guide them to the location named. Ah, well indeed
                  did the <emph>decoy</emph> play her part. She was <emph>so</emph> fearful that the
                  Indians would kill her for thus guiding their foes, that she obtained a
                     <emph>promise</emph> from the leader—and Zachary Taylor never failed to keep
                  his word—that she might leave the moment she showed them the enemy.</p>
               <p>On moved the gallant column, the Sixth Infantry. Taylor's own regiment, in the
                  van—compact and steady, moving all as one man. Onward until the sun was well up in
                  the still and cloudless heavens, when they reached the borders of a long and
                  grassy swamp, where no tree afforded shelter to advancing men, and over which the
                  horses of the mounted force could not be taken.</p>
               <p>Beyond was a dense hammock of oaks, magnolias, and mangroves; and therein, as the
                  squaw said, lay the Indian camp. And smokes were seen arising from different
                  portions of the hammock, and now and then the dusky form of a red man was seen
                  upon the edge of it, and a yell of alarm or defiance was heard, thus proving that
                  the squaw told the truth—the Indians were there!</p>
               <p>She received her reward, and was allowed to depart, and brave old "Rough and
                  Ready" deployed his men into line, and prepared for action. Dismounting from his
                  horse, and leaving all the horses of the mounted men under guard, he marched along
                  the lines to see that all were ready for the charge which he was about to make
                  against an ambushed foe, whose numbers he did not know, for he
                     <unclear>never</unclear> stopped to count or ask the numbers of the enemy. He
                  only asked <emph>where</emph> they were, and then "went in to win."</p>
               <p>Taylor's words were few, as he moved along his well-extended lines.</p>
               <p>"Men, remember Dade's massacre, and do your duty!" was all that he said.</p>
               <p>Then, when all was ready, his voice rang from the right, clear and loud as a
                  bugle—"Forward!"</p>
               <p>With a loud cheer, the gallant men moved on, the swamp at times knee-deep, and
                  then again they sank in mud and water to their waists, or nearly so—yet on they
                  moved, preserving an unbroken line.</p>
               <p>In the dark hammock beyond, all was now still as death. Not a yell could be heard,
                  not a dusky form seen now—the very smokes had died away.</p>
               <p>"Maybe the Indians have run away, colonel," said a blue-eyed boy, who, belonging
                  to a different branch of service, was a volunteer aid on the occasion.</p>
               <p>"I rather think you'll sing a different tune pretty soon, youngster!" said the
                  colonel, with a smile. "There is generally a calm before a storm!"</p>
               <p>Steadily on toward the shadowy hammock pressed the line, until it was within rifle
                  shot of the woods, and then indeed the calm was broken, and the storm of strife
                  began. All along that black range of forest, from amid the sheltering trees, a
                  sheet of fire seemed at once to run, and the bullets came thicker than hail, while
                  the terrible war-whoop seemed to emanate from a thousand, aye, ten thousand
                  throats. Whole platoons went down. Officers, singled out by the keen marksmen,
                  fell on every hand. The southern volunteers, who had been at first the most
                  impetuous, now fell into disorder. They began to retreat. In vain did their brave
                  colonel and his gallant son strive to rally them. Both fell in the bold and almost
                  mad endeavor</p>
               <p>It was a critical moment. Col. Taylor saw it—knew that all was lost without a
                  rapid movement was made.</p>
               <p>"Charge, my gallant <emph>Sixth!</emph>" he cried—"charge at double quick
                  time—don't stop to load!"</p>
               <p>On—on with a thundering cheer, they went toward the unseen but not <emph>unfelt
                     too</emph>—on, men and officers dropping at every step, but at last, leaving
                  full half of their number dead or dying in the miry swamp, they gained a foothold
                  on the firm ground.</p>
               <p>But where were the Indians now? None were there to meet the ready bayonet; none
                  lay there the victims of the random shots of the troops, but yell after yell in
                  proud triumph rose from the lake beyond, across which, in their light canoes, they
                  were speeding in safety and unharmed. Pursuit was impossible, for there were no
                  boats with the army.</p>
               <p>Men call it a victory when a battle-field is <emph>won</emph>—or rather when the
                  foe has retreated and it is occupied—but can that in truth be called a victory
                  when all the loss is upon the side of the victors? If so, 'twas dearly bought,
                  indeed—bought with the lives of many gallant officers and men who deserved a
                  better fate.</p>
               <p>Yet, on second thought, I don't know about <emph>that!</emph> They were in the
                  wrong—invading the birth-rights of the children of the soil, trying to drive them
                  from their once happy homes. Upon consideration, I don't know but that they
                  merited all they received, although it would have been better that those had
                  perished who first had started the unjust and cruel war.</p>

               <p>Heavily fell that blow upon the United States forces, which had also suffered
                  severely in several minor conflicts further to the westward in the territory. Col.
                  Taylor, burdened with a large number of wounded, and illy supplied with stores and
                  provisions, was forced to return to Tampa Bay, or Fort Brooke, as that station was
                  then called. Meantime the United States government, ever dilatory when most haste
                  is required, was slowly gathering troops into the territory, while the Indians,
                  now blood-tasted and maddened, were carrying death and desolation, with fire and
                  hatchet, into all of the border settlements Terror was running through the land.
                  Only in the larger towns, or within the picketed forts and stations of the army,
                  did the citizen deem himself and family safe. Plantations were deserted, and while
                  yet the fugitive owner was in sight, he would see the smoke of his burning
                  buildings. From beyond the <choice>
                     <sic>Suwanee</sic>
                     <corr>Sewanee</corr>
                  </choice> in the west, to the Atlantic coast in the east—from the Georgian Swamps
                  on the north to the Mangrove Keys in the south—the red scouts swept far and wide,
                  and death accompanied them where e'er they went.</p>
               <p>But, as yet, Osceola had nobly kept his promise. Wherever he and his band went,
                  men fell, but the women and children were spared.</p>
               <p>And now that he had shown the strength of his nation and their skill in war, and
                  well aware of the immense force which ultimately <unclear>could</unclear> be
                  brought against him, Osceola, prudent, though brave, determined to endeavor to
                  negotiate an honorable peace.</p>
               <p>Trusting to the <emph>honor</emph> of the pale-face—vain trust, for when did the
                  pale-face ever treat the red-man honorably?—he, according to their own customs,
                  hoisted a flag of truce, which was answered in the same way by General Hernandez,
                  at Saint Augustine, and under this tacit pledge of safety, the heroic chieftain
                  went in to seek a conference with him.</p>
               <p>Alas! he knew not the base treachery which awaited him—a treachery which should
                  forever blast the names of those who concocted it and put it into execution. The
                  brave Osceola was seized while yet his hand held the white symbol deemed so sacred
                  among honorable men—seized, loaded with manacles, and hurried down into the
                  deepest and darkest dungeon of the old Spanish fort at that place.</p>
               <p>The warriors who accompanied him, among whom was Coacoochee, though meriting less
                  mercy, were also imprisoned, but in better quarters.</p>
               <p>What wonder that rage and indignation should fill that noble warrior's breast?
                  What wonder that in the bitterness of his heart he should curse them that had so
                  wronged his trust, and swear eternal vengeance against the faithless race, if once
                  he was freed from their power, loosed from their chains! What wonder that he
                  should chafe like a caged lion while the rust of the iron gyves fairly eat into
                  his bones.</p>
               <p>"Why do you not treat me as a man?' he asked of his captors.</p>
               <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6989-00000029"/>
               <p>"You are not a man; you are a savage!" was the reply.</p>
               <p>God of Justice, what an answer! Thus spake those who broiled Guatomozin on living
                  coals to wrench from him his treasures—who tortured and led Montezuma to death,
                  that they might rob him of his jewels and gold!</p>
               <p>Who were the savages there?—the civilized, or the uncivilized—the Christian, or
                  the heathen? Let history, with its record of blood and of shame, make answer!</p>
               <p>Not long did Coacoochee and his wily comrades endure their imprisonment. The
                  guards opened their prison-doors one morning, but they were not there. How they
                  had escaped, long remained a mystery.</p>
               <p>Heavier manacles were placed upon Osceola, though he was safe in the deep dungeon
                  where they had confined him, and he was torn away from his loved Florida, and
                  carried to Fort Moultrie at Charleston. Oh, desecration base and unnatural! There
                  patriots had bled and died in defence of their native land! But now a patriot,
                  noble as the noblest of them all, was brought there a captive, to suffer and to
                     <emph>die!</emph> Yes, to die, for when they took Osceola from Florida, hope
                  left his brave, proud heart, <emph>and it broke!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>He died! Yes, murdered upon the funeral pyre of <emph>honor</emph>—a victim to the
                  faithless race in whom he had trusted. We may believe, though we know not, that
                  even in death's bitterness he remembered the "White Dove," for a smile was on his
                  face when they found him dead. They could torture him no more</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIX.</head>
               <p>There was another council held upon Arpiaka's island in the everglades, for
                  Chikika and Chittee Emathla, and others, had heard with grief and indignation of
                  the treacherous capture and base imprisonment of Osceola and his comrades. But the
                  news of his death had not reached them, nor yet of the escape of Coacoochee. The
                  rejoicing of the red men over their recent victories was hushed, and their faces
                  were dark with gloom.</p>
               <p>How to rescue him from captivity, or to force the whites to release him, was the
                  question before the council, and, as ever, the advice and wisdom of Arpiaka was
                  consulted.</p>
               <p>Pardon me if I depart from the council a moment, to relate a side incident which
                  occurred during their session. I will return to it soon.</p>
               <p>In a sad and pensive mood, Ona was wandering along the margin of the island,
                  stopping now and then to pick a flower, but then, listlessly plucking it to
                  pieces, and casting the crushed leaves away. She was thinking of poor Osceola,
                  whom she honored and pitied, though she did not love him. Her heart as yet knew no
                  love but that which she felt for her father, and the fond memories which she
                  cherished of her mother. Was it ever to be thus? Was no fitting mate,
                  heaven-destined for her pure bosom, to appear and wake the hidden fire which all
                  like her possess, to a greater or less degree? Let time and our future chapters
                  reveal that which is yet a mystery.</p>
               <p>The maiden had wandered to some distance away from her father's lodge, and now
                  stood alone by the clear, silvery water, at the usual landing-place of canoes,
                  coming from the south, or rather, from the south-east. While thus she stood,
                  looking at her own lovely form, mirrored in the glassy water, she heard the sound
                  of a paddle, and looking up, her eyes full upon the form of Coacoochee, who at
                  that instant landed.</p>
               <p>Though his usual sneer was on his face, she spoke to him, knowing that he had been
                  captured with Osceola.</p>
               <p>"Has Osceola been released?" she asked.</p>
               <p>The Indian folded his arms upon his breast, a sardonic smile gathered upon his
                  face, as he paused and scanned her from head to foot, but he made no reply.</p>
               <p>"Good Coacoochee, do tell me, is Osceola, like yourself, <emph>free?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Ho! when the 'White Dove' would seek news of <hi rend="i"/>Osceola, then
                  Coacoochee is <emph>good!</emph> But when he tells the 'White Dove' that he loves
                  her, and would take her to his lodge to be his <emph>wife,</emph> then her face
                  grows dark, and she calls him <emph>devil!</emph>" said the Indian, in a bitter
                  tone.</p>
               <p>"I will ever speak kindly to you, Coacoochee, but do tell me what I ask?" she
                  urged.</p>
               <p>"Does the 'White Dove' love Osceola?" he asked, fixing his glittering eye upon her
                  face, so that no emotion expressed there should escape his notice.</p>
               <p>"Yes, as a brother is loved by a sister!" she replied.</p>
               <p>"Then let the 'White Dove' weep for Osceola—she will see him no more!" said he,
                  while a malicious gleam of satisfaction shot athwart his dark face.</p>
               <p>"What! dead—so noble and so good, and <emph>dead!</emph>" she moaned.</p>
               <p>"No—better than that! He lives to <emph>suffer</emph> in chains in a dungeon; but
                  he is dying; he refuses food, and his heart is broken!"</p>
               <p>"Not dead? I will go to him! My prayers, my representations of his noble character
                  will avail, and they will set him free!" cried the generous-hearted girl.</p>
               <p>"Yes, come! Coacoochee will take you in his canoe!" said the wily villain, and his
                  eyes flashed with sudden passion, for he thought he had her in his power, and he
                  advanced toward her, as if he would lift her into his boat.</p>
               <p>But at a glance she divined his passions and his vile intent.</p>
               <p>"Stand back, wretch!" cried she, as she drew and cocked a pistol within a yard of
                  his naked breast. "Stand back, or you die! When I want escort I will seek other
                  than the <emph>coward</emph> who deserted his leader, in distress!"</p>
               <p>Coacoochee's serpent-like eyes flashed with a deadly anger, but he knew <choice>
                     <sic>thatt he</sic>
                     <corr>that the</corr>
                  </choice> maiden was firm and fearless, and that death would meet <emph>him</emph>
                  before he could reach <emph>her</emph>. So he drew his canoe up on the shore, and
                  sullenly turning away, disappeared in the direction of the Grand Council House, to
                  which, reader, we will now return.</p>
               <p>The proposal which Arpiaka made, after he had somewhat cheered up the gloomy
                  warriors, and had bid them to rise superior to despair, was that they should seize
                  some noted general or leader of the whites—if possible, Hernandez himself—and hold
                  him, with threats of torture, if Osceola was not delivered up.</p>
               <p>Chikika followed him.</p>
               <p>"The words of my brother, the Great Prophet, are good!" he said. "We will act upon
                  his counsel! And with him, I say to my brothers, be strong of heart. We have won
                  great battles without loss, even as Arpiaka foretold. It is true a cloud is upon
                  us now, for Osceola is not here, but we have strong arms to rescue him, or, should
                  he perish, to strike for revenge!"</p>
               <p>"Then prepare to strike, for 'ere this, Osceola is no more!" cried Coacoochee,
                  advancing into the circle.</p>
               <p>"Why is Coacoochee here and Osceola absent?" asked Arpiaka.</p>
               <p>"I and those who were with me escaped—all except Osceola!" said Coacoochee.</p>
               <p>"And you left Osceola to his fate?"</p>
               <p>"We could not aid him! He was confined in a dungeon beneath the ground, and bound
                  in chains. We were told that he refused to eat food, and was dying. But we were
                  not placed near him, and when our guards slept, we escaped! I am here, and ready
                  once more to fight the pale-faces!"</p>
               <p>The wily chief sat down, and for a time there was silence in the council.</p>
               <p>It was broken by the arrival of a runner from the north, and he brought the
                  tidings of Osceola's death.</p>
               <p>Then, like the low muttering of distant thunder, was heard the words of anger and
                  of anguish breaking from those warriors' lips. And while they chaunted the brave
                  deeds of their lost chief, they mingled their threats of revenge in the wild song,
                  and vowed that for each drop of blood that had stiffened in his broken heart, a
                  pale-faced foe should fall. The time to ask for peace had passed—the time to trust
                  in the mercy or the <emph>honor</emph> of the pale-face was gone, gone, never to
                  return!</p>
               <p>After taking advice from Arpiaka, in regard to ensuing movements, the council
                  broke up.</p>
               <p>Then Arpiaka returned to his lodge, where he found Ona weeping.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, daughter?" he asked, wondering to see tears fall from
                     <emph>her</emph> eyes.</p>
               <p>"Poor Osceola is dying broken-hearted in a dungeon, my father'!" she said.</p>
               <p>"No, my girl, he is free from the malice of his persecutors!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Free,</emph> father, FREE?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, child, free in <emph>death</emph>—his spirit has left this, for a better
                  world!"</p>
               <p>"Thank God that he will suffer no more!" she murmured, and her tears ceased to
                  flow.</p>
               <p>"Did you love him, Ona?" asked her father.</p>
               <p>"As a brother, I loved him—he was gentle to <emph>me,</emph> noble to every one.
                  He was the opposite in everything of that hateful Coacoochee, whom I both fear and
                  detest!"</p>
               <p>"Why, do you fear him, my child? Am I not ever near to protect you?"</p>
               <p>The reply of Ona was a description of her interview with Coacoochee, when he
                  landed precisely as it occurred.</p>
               <p>Arpiaka's brow grew very dark while he listened to her story, and when she closed,
                  he said:</p>
               <p>"If the base wretch is not more careful, he shall feel the strength of my arm and
                  know how dangerous it is to cross my path, or harbor evil thoughts against the
                  dove of my bosom! Never stir abroad, my child, without attendants, and on no
                  occasion, either by night or by day, do you be unarmed!"</p>
               <p>"I never am, my father!" she replied. "And, thanks to your tuition, my aim is
                  almost as certain as your own!"</p>
               <p>"And closely watch your food, my child. for he is revengeful, and may, by some
                  means, attempt to poison her whom he cannot possess!"</p>
               <p>"I never eat until my food has been tasted by some of my pet animals, father, for
                  I was warned of this by Osceola!"</p>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6989-00000030"/>
               <p>At that moment a sharp twang, and a hurtling sound was heard in the air, and an
                  arrow struck Arpiaka full upon the breast. A low scream broke from Ona's lips, but
                  there was no need of her terror, for the arrow fell splintered at her father's
                  feet.</p>
               <p>"My shirt of mail has rendered me good service!" he said, with a smile, as he
                  picked up the broken pieces of the arrow, and cheered his daughter's fluttering
                  heart with the assurance that he was not hurt.</p>
               <p>But anxiety shrouded his face when he looked at a mark on the feather-end of the
                  arrow, and saw that it was the stamp of a fish, the sign of Chikika.</p>
               <p>"What can Chikika have against me, that he should seek my life?" said he, in a low
                  tone. And then he bade one of his slaves to go and seek Chikika, and ask him to
                  come and see him.</p>
               <p>The latter was soon by his side.</p>
               <p>"Why does my brother seek my life?" asked Arpiaka, gravely, as his eyes met those
                  of the tall chief.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Thy</emph> life? My brother's words are strange," said the chief, in
                  surprise. "I cannot understand them."</p>
               <p>"Whose arrow was this, which was sped from yonder orange grove, full pointed
                  toward my heart, but entered not, for the shield of the Great Spirit was before
                  me, and shattered it thus?" said Arpiaka, exhibiting the fragments of the
                  arrow.</p>
               <p>"It was mine," said Chikika, "but it did not go from my hand to thy breast. I lent
                  my bow and arrows to Coacoochee but a little while since, for he wanted to shoot
                  fish in the Glade with them, he said."</p>
               <p>"Where is he now?"</p>
               <p>"I saw him pushing off in his canoe but a moment since," replied the chief. "Shall
                  I follow and slay the traitor who would have killed my brother?"</p>
               <p>"No," said Arpiaka. "His <emph>failure</emph> shall be his punishment. He will not
                  now dare to come near me, for he has seen that the Great Spirit protects me. I
                  cannot be slain! Let him go; he is a daring warrior, and hates our pale-faced
                  foes, and, though he will avoid me now, he will harrass them."</p>
               <p>"It is true; my brother is wise, and the Great Spirit is with him," said Chikika,
                  turning thoughtfully away.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXX.</head>
               <p>"A couple of gentlemen are below, madam, who wish to see you," said a servant to
                  Mrs. Febiger, some days after her interview with Clarence, which we described in
                  the twenty-fifth chapter. "Here are their cards."</p>
               <p>The invalid lady took the cards and read the names of "Erastus Blacking, Esq.,"
                  and "Amasa Queer, broker, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">et cetera, et
                  cetera</foreign>."</p>
               <p>"Ah, these are the men whose evidence and assistance rendered were of so much
                  value to me in obtaining my divorce," she said to herself. Then addressing the
                  servant, she added, "Show the gentlemen up."</p>
               <p>In a short time, the two ancient bachelors were ushered in—both of them dressed
                  with extra care, and actually looking so neat and well, that one might be pardoned
                  for "<emph>guessing</emph>" that one or both had actually been thinking of that
                  most desperate of follies in old-bachelordom, <emph>matrimony</emph>.</p>
               <p>"Excuse my rising, gentlemen; I am, unfortunately, quite an invalid," said the
                  lady, as she, by a motion, directed the servant to hand chairs for her
                  visiters.</p>
               <p>"Very excusable, madam. I regret your illness, sincerely," said Mr. Blacking, with
                  a low bow.</p>
               <p>"And I from the lowermost depths of my heart, I assure you, my dear madam!" said
                  Mr. Queer, making two profound bows.</p>
               <p>"I noticed in the papers, madam, that your son had graduated with great honor at
                  West Point," continued Mr. Blacking.</p>
               <p>"With decided distinction—stood far above par in his class," added Mr. Queer.</p>
               <p>"Yes, gentlemen; but, while I feel a pride in his success, I have to mourn that it
                  deprives me of his company. He has sailed with his company for Florida, there to
                  join his regiment, which is already in service."</p>
               <p>"Ah, indeed; but we will hope for his safety and success," said Blacking.</p>
               <p>"Yes, hope is a blessed thing. It has kept me up many a time, when, amid the
                  fluctuations of stocks and the crash of broken firms, I almost began to despair!"
                  added Queer.</p>
               <p>"Our particular business here this morning, my dear madam," said Mr. Blacking,
                  "was to ask if your late husband had in any way annoyed you, and if he had, to
                  offer you our services to get him out of the country or locked up again. He has
                  been out of prison for some time, and called on us to learn your whereabouts,
                  which, of course, we would not give him"</p>
               <p>"Most <emph>decidedly</emph> not!" said Mr. Queer, taking a pinch of snuff, and
                  tendering the box to the lady, which, <emph>of course</emph>, she declined, for
                  she <emph>was</emph> a lady, and would not make a dirt-tunnel of her nostrils.</p>
               <p>"We gave him quite a sum of money, and advised him to reform, and see if he could
                  not yet be a man," continued Blacking. "At first he was rough and hardened, but
                  our kindness seemed to soften him."</p>
               <p>"Even to tears!" added Mr. Queer.</p>
               <p>"If he has a wish to reform, Heaven help him!" sighed the lady. "He has not been
                  here, and it would be useless for him to attempt to see me. I never will permit
                  it. We were never united in heart, and now, that I am free from him, I shall
                  remain so."</p>
               <p>"Excellent idea!" said Mr. Blacking.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Most</emph> excellent!" added Mr. Queer.</p>
               <p>"I hope you will permit me to call occasionally, to inquire after your health, my
                  dear madam?" said the lawyer.</p>
               <p>"And your humble servant also?" added the broker.</p>
               <p>"Certainly, gentlemen. I thank you for your kindness," said Mrs. F.</p>
               <p>Her visiters now arose, and, with many bows, left her presence. She felt relieved
                  then, for she was really too ill and low-spirited to enjoy any company, even of
                  her own sex, not to speak of gentlemen who were almost strangers to her.</p>
               <p>"A fine woman!" said Blacking to Queer, as they passed into the street.</p>
               <p>"A <emph>very</emph> fine woman!" replied Queer, as they moved along.</p>
               <p>"Got lots of money by her father's death," said the lawyer.</p>
               <p>"Worth enough to stock a bank, or build a railroad," added Queer.</p>
               <p>They now walked on for some time in silence, both seeming to be deeply abstracted
                  and occupied with thought. At last the lawyer broke silence:</p>
               <p>"Have you ever thought of matrimony, brother Queer?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"Not till <emph>very</emph> lately, brother Blacking," replied the broker.</p>
               <p>"Nor I," continued the lawyer.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Febiger is a <emph>very</emph> nice woman—I was just thinking of
                     <emph>her</emph>," said Mr. Queer.</p>
               <p>"So was I," said the lawyer.</p>
               <p>"I think her and myself would make a capital match," continued the broker.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Queer!" cried Blacking, in a tone sharp enough to drive a tenpenny nail home
                  into a pine knot.</p>
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6989-00000031"/>
               <p>"<emph>What!</emph>" cried the broker, in a tone of wonder.</p>
               <p>"You're a devilish old fool, sir! The lady is young enough to be your grandchild,
                  sir. What business had <emph>you</emph> to cast your eyes where <emph>I</emph> was
                  about to place my primeval affections?" thundered Blacking.</p>
               <p>"That is the question which I should ask <emph>you</emph>, sir!" cried Queer, in a
                  tone equally excited. "As to being <emph>old</emph>, I may be a year or two your
                  senior, sir, but I'm flesh and blood, sir, not skin and bone!"</p>
               <p>"Amasa Queer, I'll—I'll—"</p>
               <p>The lawyer paused, though half-choked with rage.</p>
               <p>"Well, what'll you do?" said the broker, pausing also, and looking as if he was
                  ready for battle.</p>
               <p>"I'll acknowledge myself to be a devilish fool, to quarrel with one who has lived
                  like a brother with me for twenty years, about a woman who probably wouldn't have
                  either of us!"</p>
               <p>"And I'm another, brother Blacking. Take my hand, and let us wipe away all
                  remembrance of these unpleasant words over a bottle of old Amontillado."</p>
               <p>"Agreed, with all my heart, brother Queer," said Blacking.</p>
               <p>And the two old bachelors walked off briskly, arm and arm, as cheerful as if they
                  had never spoken a word in dispute. Would that all quarrels, with a woman at the
                  bottom, could end as cheerfully and as bloodlessly.</p>
               <p>But this is a queer world, and curious doings illustrate it.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXXI.</head>
               <p>After the battles of Okachobee, Withlacoochee, Ocklawaha. Lake Monroe, Jupiter
                  Inlet, etc, etc, the United States government began to learn that even though they
                  had but a few hundred of scorned and wronged Indians to contend with, yet
                     <emph>they</emph> were not to be despised. The ablest officers were foiled and
                  beaten; disease and death thinned their ranks; and the Indians—here, there, and
                  everywhere—moving with wonderful rapidity and secrecy, kept continually at work.
                  Express riders were shot down, scouts and sentinels cut off, one by one, and yet
                  so few Indians were slain or captured, that the taking of a squaw or a couple of
                  papooses began to be considered a matter of such importance, as to require a
                  special dispatch to headquarters.</p>
               <p>The forces were increased, posts established through all parts of the territory,
                  where they really were <emph>not</emph> required, and the pine-barrens, which were
                  easy to march through or ride over, and which would be the last place in which to
                  find an Indian, were thoroughly overran by their military scouts. The red man,
                  laughing at such scientific warfare, retreated to the fertile islands in their
                  great warriors and everglades, where their squaws planted corn, potatoes and
                  melons, while the warriors, saving up their powder and lead for their pale-faced
                  foes, speared fish and turtle in the lakes and lagoons, or with the bow and arrow
                  brought down the turkey, scarlet-coated flamingo, the "coon," deer, and a hundred
                  other kinds of wild game, more abundant there than in any other region on this
                  continent.</p>
               <p>From these hiding-places small parties often sallied out, and wo to the scouting
                  party which passed their ambuscades. One volley from the red men would lay a dozen
                  or two of the soldiers low, then let the rest charge upon the spot where the
                  Indians had been, and they were not there. Search was useless and pursuit vain. If
                  the red men in any section were closely pushed, or had got nearly out of
                  ammunition, a white flag would be shown, and they would evince a desire to have "a
                  talk"—come in, get presents of blankets, tobacco and whiskey, steal or buy powder
                  and lead, and then absquatulate, leaving the duped pale-faces to "talk" by
                  themselves.</p>
               <p>But this could not last always. A taxed people began to ask why over eight or nine
                  millions of dollars a year was being spent to exterminate a few hundred Indians,
                  and used in vain. General after general was recalled, or begged to be relieved
                  from command—Clinch, Gaines, Jessup, and even Macomb had botched their
                  work—Armstead did but little, and it was left for Taylor and Worth to
                     <emph>nearly</emph> close the war. Thus far historical and explanatory—now to
                  our story again.</p>
               <p>Finding that the main body of the Indians had "holed away" in the Big Cypress, and
                  among the thousands of islands in the everglades, approachable only by boats,
                  through intricate and almost inaccessible channels, the Second Dragoons
                  dismounted, and the Third Artillery, acting as infantry, were, at the time of
                  which I write, sent to co-operate with a marine and naval force in that
                  section.</p>
               <p>One morning, when a portion of these forces were encamped at the mouth of the
                  River Miami, as it is called, a small, boatable creek, which, running out from the
                  everglades, empties into Key Biscayno Bay, near Cape Florida, a scout came in and
                  reported Indian signs up at the head of the stream, some eight or nine miles
                  distant, where a small party had apparently encamped and landed with two canoes.
                  He so judged by finding <emph>two</emph> stakes to which the boats had been
                  fastened.</p>
               <p>"You've been sighing for a chance to distinguish yourself, Lieutenant Febiger, for
                  some time; you can try your hand now!" said Col. Harney to our friend Clarence.
                  "Take your favorite sergeant, Marston—who, by the way is a tip-top soldier—and
                  twenty-five men, and try to render some account of the infernal red bounds!"</p>
               <p>The young officer was delighted with the order, and hastened to obey it. In a very
                  short time his detachment was embarked in six of the long, light, cypress canoes
                  which had been furnished to the government at about ten times their value, for the
                  purpose of using in the narrow creeks and bayous. Up the stream, which is sluggish
                  near the mouth, but very rapid toward its head, the young officer urged his boats,
                  himself leading the van. It was well on in the day, owing to the rapidity of the
                  stream, before he arrived at the place where the scout had seen the signs; and
                  here, though he had not had a great deal of experience in wood-craft, he at once
                  saw, by the numerous spots where fire had been built, that the party was larger
                  than the scout had supposed or reported. But numbers would not deter him after he
                  was started, and as his men were armed with that incomparable weapon, then newly
                  invented, COLT'S REPEATING RIFLE, he determined to follow, and not to return
                  without an engagement.</p>
               <p>The scout, who did not belong to the regular service, but was hired as a spy and a
                  guide, remonstrated against this in such strong terms, that Clarence angrily bade
                  him go back, and take care of his precious person inside of the fort.</p>
               <p>Then, judging that the Indians had entered the everglades, then almost entirely
                  unexplored, he boldly took the first channel which opened before him in the great
                  "Grassy Water." And, as if to prove his sagacity, scarce had he entered it, when
                  at a distance he saw a canoe with five Indians in it, which, however, under their
                  skill and strength, soon disappeared again; but he followed on, not doubting but
                  that somewhere he should come up with them. And, still more to exhilirate his
                  ambitious hopes, a column of smoke was seen to rise from a small island, covered
                  with trees, a couple of miles or so in advance of him, and soon it, evidently a
                  signal, was answered by several smokes in different directions.</p>
               <p>"We are stirring them up, seargeant!" said the young officer to Marston.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir. I hope we won't stir too many of them, though!"</p>
               <p>"Why, <emph>you</emph> are not afraid of powder, I am sure! In every action, so
                  far, you have behaved as if you set no value whatever on your life, and by your
                  gallantry merited your rapid promotion!"</p>
               <p>"True, sir, life is of little value to <emph>me</emph>; but you, young, with a
                  bright career before you, <emph>you</emph> must not rashly throw your life away!
                  You, too, sir, have <emph>another</emph> to live for, I have not!"</p>
               <p>The utterly hopeless tone in which these last words were uttered, touched the
                  sympathetic heart of the young officer, and he said:</p>
               <p>"You musn't be so down-hearted, sergeant; you have much to live for—may yet
                  receive further promotion! You speak truly—I <emph>have</emph> some one to live
                  for; it would break my mother's heart if I were to fall, but I must stand my
                  chance among the rest!"</p>
               <p>"Will you do me a favor before we land on yonder island, lieutenant?" asked
                  Marston.</p>
               <p>"Yes, if within my line of duty!"</p>
               <p>"Then, sir, please lay aside your frock-coat, with its straps and buttons, which
                  make you too conspicuous a mark for the enemy's sharp-shooters, and put on this
                  plain jacket, which I brought purposely for you!" said the sergeant, unfolding a
                  parcel.</p>
               <p>"You are very thoughtful, Marston, and it would be unkind of me to refuse your
                  request!" said Clarence.</p>
               <p>And he took off his coat and put on the jacket, which did not now distinguish him
                  from the other men.</p>
               <p>They approached the small island rapidly, but the smoke which had been raised
                  lasted only a few moments—then died away.</p>
               <p>With commendable prudence, a virtue always allied to true valor, the young officer
                  scattered his boats, and landed with caution. The island, which did not contain
                  more than ten or fifteen acres, was a beautiful spot. A fine grove of large live
                  oaks covered most of it; the underbrush had all been cut away, and corn, sweet
                  potatoes, pineapples and bananas had been planted there, and were now in full
                  perfection. Indian signs were plenty, and the remnants of the fire of sticks and
                  damp moss with which they had made their signal-smoke, <ref rend="super"
                     target="#note_008" xml:id="return_008">*</ref>
                  was discovered<note place="foot" xml:id="note_008">
                     
                     <p><ref target="#return_008">*</ref>By these moss-made signal smokes, which would suddenly send a dense column
                        up in the air, the Indians, during the war, communicated the approach of the
                        government troops to each other, and thus were prepared to attack or evade
                        them. Like magic, I have seen a dozen of these telegraphic smokes rise in
                        various quarters in a few moments.</p>
                  </note><pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6989-00000032"/> covered, but not a
                  single living being could be seen or heard.</p>
               <p>It was now nearly dark, and Lieut. Febiger determined to encamp there for the
                  night. for, though other and larger islands were in sight, and not very distant,
                  it would have been utterly useless to try and follow the sinuous channels in the
                  dark.</p>
               <p>Posting sentinels thickly around, and hauling has canoes ashore, and with them
                  forming a temporary breast-work, to use in case of sudden attack, the young
                  officer prepared to pass the night A small camp-fire, hidden from distant view by
                  bushes cut and stuck like a picket around it, was lighted, and over it the
                  soldiers made their coffee and cooked their supper, improving their opportunity by
                  appropriating corn, potatoes, fruit. etc., from the Indian fields They ha I
                  brought no tents—in that climate none were required.</p>
               <p>Thus, before dark, all, except the sentinels, were as comfortably encamped as they
                  could have been at the regimental head-quarters. And the latter, when relieved
                  every two hours, enjoyed the same comforts which their comrades had before
                  them.</p>
               <p>Two there were in the little camp who did not feel much inclination to sleep—one
                  was Marston, the other the young lieutenant, who felt the responsibility of his
                  station. Strict orders were given to keep silence in the camp, and, as there was
                  scarce a zephyr to stir a leaf overhead, all was very still. The lieutenant had
                  wandered down to the edge of the island, upon the side toward a larger one, which
                  seemed to be distant not more than four or five miles. While he stood there, the
                  faint <hi rend="i"/>tum tum of an Indian drum was heard, the sound seeming to come
                  from the large island, and, once and a while, shrill yells could be heard in the
                  same direction.</p>
               <p>"They are dancing the war-dance. I shall have hot work to-morrow," muttered the
                  young officer.</p>
               <p>A sigh, deep and heavy, as if it came from an overladen heart, fell upon his car,
                  and that was the first intimation he had that any one was near him. On looking
                  around, he saw, by the pale light of the moon, the form of Marston standing, like
                  a statue, by the side of an oak, where he had been when the officer approached the
                  spot.</p>
               <p>"Why, sergeant, I supposed that you had turned in," said the lieutenant.</p>
               <p>"No, sir, when one has but a few hours to five, it were folly in him to waste them
                  in sleep," replied Marston. "I heard the noise made by the savages, some time
                  since, and came down here to listen and reflect."</p>
               <p>"All right, except your idea that you have but a little time to live. Banish all
                  such ideas from your breast, sergeant. Armed as we are, we are equal to more than
                  a hundred white men, let alone a lot of ignorant savages. Dismiss all thoughts of
                  death from your mind, my brave fellow!"</p>
               <p>"Sir, I cannot," said the sergeant, in a choked voice. "I could not if I would, I
                  would not if I could, for life, long since, became to me a burden. I have a
                  presentiment that to-morrow will be my last on earth."</p>
               <p>"Let us hope not. I have long noted that some secret sorrow seemed to prey heavily
                  upon your mind, and have felt a deep sympathy for you"</p>
               <p>"God bless you—God bless you!" and, for a few moments, sobs choked the utterance
                  of the man, who, though a father, with a parent's yearning love in his bosom,
                  dared not, even then, with the presentiment of approaching death laying like lead
                  upon his heart, make himself known to his son, lest that son should despise
                  him.</p>
               <p>Nobly had he striven to redeem the manhood which almost had died out during his
                  career of dissipation and crime—with what success, his promotion and the respect
                  entertained for him by his officers can best give proof.</p>
               <p>At last he became calm again, and, drawing a sealed package from his bosom, he
                  handed it to Clarence, and said:</p>
               <p>"Sir, if I fall to-morrow, open this, and it will tell you the history of one who,
                  in his latter brief and unhappy days, tried to redeem the errors of his early
                  life. And should one fear of pity fall from your eyes when I am gone, should
                     <emph>you</emph> think of me kindly, and bear my last, almost hopeless, request
                  for forgiveness to one who is named therein, then I shall not have lived or died
                  altogether in vain."</p>
               <p>"Your request shall be complied with." said Clarence. "But cheer up, my man.
                  Tomorrow we will have a merry fight, and whip out a score or two of these red
                  rascals, and go back with honor to the regiment!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>You</emph> may, but <emph>I</emph> shall not. But excuse me, lieutenant; I
                  will go the rounds, and see if the sentinels are on the alert. We cannot be too
                  watchful when the enemy are so near."</p>
               <p>"True, sergeant. I will go and take an hour's sleep, if I can get it. Let me be
                  woke, if I sleep, each time that the guard is relieved."</p>
               <p>"I will, sir," replied Marston. "But I think we will not be disturbed here
                  to-night. If we <emph>are</emph>, it will be just before daybreak, when men are
                  generally supposed to sleep most soundly."</p>
               <p>"We will be ready for them; but I think they will await an attack from us," said
                  the young officer, as he walked back to the campfire, and, wrapping a blanket
                  around him, cast himself upon a tired soldier's couch—the ground.</p>
               <p>And the sergeant went his rounds, murmuring as he went: "Noble, noble boy! If I
                  can but die for him, and he return to tell his mother that I preserved his life at
                  the cost of my own, then, perhaps, she will forgive me, and shed a tear for me
                  when I am gone!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXII.</head>
               <p>The sound of the Indian drum, and the yells which had reached the ears of the
                  lieutenant and his sergeant, came from the island of Arpiaka. The party which had
                  encamped near the head of the Miami was a portion of Chikika's band, headed by
                  himself, who had been out to see what the forces below contemplated, and who, now
                  that danger was so near to Aripiaka in his chosen island home, could not be
                  induced to leave him without protection, at least, until it was settled whether
                  the whites would venture into the unknown intricacies of the glades. If they did,
                  he was not only prepared for resistance there, but afar off, in the very centre of
                  the Great Cypress Swamp, he had prepared another home for his adopted brother,
                  which the pale-faces might seek to find in vain, for it was a trackless way which
                  led to it, through many a dark and winding creek, through many a blinding bayou,
                  amid tangled mangroves and cypress, which would cheek the progress of anything
                  human, except an Indian, and bother everything else, except a serpent or an
                  alligator.</p>
               <p>It was Chikika, in person, who had detected the advance of Febiger and his small
                  detachment—his canoe which the latter had seen. The chief had been so near that he
                  had counted the number of the enemy, and he had made the alarm signals before
                  spoken of. From Arpiaka's island, where some seventy or eighty of his best braves
                  were assembled, he had watched the movements of the young officer, when he landed
                  and encamped, and he judged rightly, that the lieutenant would defer an
                  examination of the larger island until morning.</p>
               <p>He had made his report to Arpiaka, and they together had determined to defend the
                  island, and to utterly cut off and destroy the party, so insignificant in numbers,
                  that had thus come to "beard the lion in his den."</p>
               <p>To effect this, Arpiaka, whose knowledge of military matters was extensive, had
                  shown the chief how to construct breast-works at every accessible point of
                  landing, so that when the whites advanced, the Indians, fully covered, could
                  receive them, with deadly aim, at pointblank fire.</p>
               <p>After this was done, Chikika had assembled his warriors to dance the war-dance,
                  with his words, and the recital of their former deeds of valor, stimulating them
                  for the coming struggle</p>
               <p>Ona stood upon the fanciful little porch which fronted her father's lodge, gazing
                  out through the trellised vines upon the wild scene, looking at the dusky forms,
                  which, hideous with paint, danced and leaped like demons around the fire which had
                  been built in the large square, in the centre of the encampment. Their frightful
                  yells, as they brandished their weapons of death, rung harshly upon the ear, for
                  her associations had not destroyed the woman-nature within her pure bosom.</p>
               <p>"My father," said she to him, as he stood by her side, "you surely will not mingle
                  in the strife which you anticipate?"</p>
               <p>"I shall use no weapons against my own race, dear child," was his reply; "but I
                  must encourage my brave defenders with my presence, and strengthen them with my
                  counsel!"</p>
               <p>"Cannot these men be made captive, instead of being slain?" she asked again.</p>
               <p>"That were indeed a folly!" said he. "We have not more than enough to provision
                  ourselves—no warriors to spare to guard them; and were they released, they would
                  guide overpowering numbers here to destroy us. No, for our own safety, they must
                  perish; and it is but a just reward for their temerity. They invade our homes for
                  the purpose of destroying us. In this war, so far, they have neither shown mercy
                  or honor; they merit no mercy at <emph>our</emph> hands!"</p>
               <p>"It <emph>may</emph> be all right, my father, but this shedding of <choice>
                     <sic>humun</sic>
                     <corr>human</corr>
                  </choice> blood is, to me, <emph>very</emph> terrible!"</p>
               <p>"Naturally so, my dear child; yet there are cases when it must be done. Now, we
                  act not offensively, but strictly in defence of our homes and our lives. But, dear
                  Ona, you had better retire. Do not stir from the lodge, in the morning, upon any
                  account. Go in now, for I have matters to arrange with Chikika, and would see him
                  alone!"</p>
               <p>The sweet girl kissed her father's lofty brow, and retired within the lodge—not to
                  rest, for she could not slumber while the shrill war-cries were ringing in her
                  ears.</p>
               <p>And Arpiaka walked slowly forth to meet Chikika.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head>
               <p>The night passed on, the moon went down, and I the day dawned—but no alarm was
                  given to disturb the camp of the young lieutenant. The sun rose unclouded, and a
                  cool and gentle breeze whispered among the leaves overhead, and rustled away amid
                  the tall grass of the glades.</p>
               <p>Several small smokes, rising from the larger Island, gave evidence to the officer
                  that Indians were encamped there, and in such strength of numbers, that they did
                  not deem any concealment necessary. But so confident was he in the courage of his
                  men, and the great superiority of his repeating fire-arms, that he felt no
                  hesitation about attacking them, and he bade his men take matters easy, and get a
                  comfortable breakfast, at the same time announcing that he should move immediately
                  after upon the larger island. The men, who were much attached to their young
                  leader, who was kind, though strict in his discipline, coffin him heartily, and
                  hurried through their morning meal, and prepared for work.</p>
               <p>Marston seemed very cheerful, and moved about with an alacrity which induced the
                  young officer to think that he had conquered his dark forebodings of the previous
                  evening. He had not learned enough of human nature to know that a cloak of gaiety
                  often covered the coffin of hope—that some men are ever "saddest when they
                  smile."</p>
               <p>The sun was about an hour high when the camp was broken up, and the canoes again
                  launched. After very carefully inspecting all of the arms, and seeing that each
                  man was properly supplied with ammunition, the lieutenant gave his final orders,
                  and bidding <emph>them</emph> follow where <emph>he</emph> led, embarked, and
                  headed his boat for the larger island. The channel, though crooked, was quite
                  plain; but they moved on with caution, list at some sudden turn they should
                  unexpectedly be met by the Indians, in their canoes, and receive a fire before
                  they were prepared for it.</p>
               <p>Thus nearly two hours elapsed before they came within long rifle shot of the large
                  island. Upon it, now, everything was still as death. The smokes had disappeared,
                  and not a sign of life could be seen upon the shore, as they slowly and steadily
                  approached.</p>
               <p>"I'm afraid they have given us the slip, Marston!" said the officer.</p>
               <p>"No danger of that, sir; we will soon <emph>see</emph> and <emph>feel</emph> them,
                  too! Have you got the package which I gave you, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, it is here, inside my vest!" said the officer.</p>
               <p>"If my advice is not intrusive, sir, I would scatter my boats, so as to land in an
                  extended line, if I were in your place, sir. The enemy cannot then so concentrate
                  their fire, as now!"</p>
               <p>"You are right, sergeant. I am obliged to you!" said the officer, who, unlike some
                     <emph>foplings</emph> of the "button," whom I have known in my "day and
                  generation," had the good sense to listen to and profit by advice, even if it did
                  come from a subordinate.</p>
               <p>The line of boats was extended in front of a smooth beach, back of which a skirt
                  of low hedge-like bushes arose, and then the order was given, in a voice loud and
                  clear as a bugle, by Clarence, to "<emph>land!</emph>"</p>
               <p>With a hearty cheer the men dashed on; in a moment they were close to the beach,
                  but then the ominous silence was suddenly broken, and from the bushes covering
                  their front a terrible fire was opened, which seemed almost as one discharge. More
                  than half of the men fell dead at the first fire, and others were wounded, but the
                  impetus of the boats drove them to the shore.</p>
               <p>"Charge!" shouted young Febiger, as he leaped, unhurt, from his boat, followed by
                  Marston, who had not yet been touched.</p>
               <p>But another volley, apparently from a reserved force, rung upon the air, more men
                  went down never to rise again, and both Marston and his leader were desperately
                  wounded.</p>
               <p>"You had better retreat, sir, or you are lost!" cried the sergeant.</p>
               <p>"Never, so help me God, never!" cried the young officer. "My poor men, my poor
                  men!"</p>
               <p>Then firing rapidly into the bushes, though he could not advance, he cheered the
                  few who yet lived with his shout, and bade them do battle to the last.</p>
               <p>But loud above his shout arose the fierce yells of the Indians, and their
                  unceasing fire was kept up, and very soon only two of all that gallant band had
                  life left in them. <emph>They</emph> had fired their last shots, and were too weak
                  to load again, when the Indians, headed by a chief of immense size, by whose side
                  strode a pale-faced man with long, white hair and beard, dashed aside the bushes
                  with which they had masked their breast-work, and rushed on to finish their bloody
                  work.</p>
               <p>The sergeant, who was even then dying,<figure>

                  <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6989-00000034"/> dragged himself before the form of his
                  helpless leader, and, looking wildly at the white-haired man who advanced,
                  recognized him, and cried:</p>
               <p>"Arthur Livingston, for God's sake, save <emph>my sun</emph>—save Clarence
                  Febiger, if you are a man!"</p>
               <p>"My God—is that Marcus Febiger?" cried Arpiaka, for he it was whom the dying man
                  had called Arthur Livingston.</p>
               <p>"All that is left of him—Clarence—Clar—"</p>
               <p>He turned, cast one look of fondness upon his bewildered and astonished son, then
                  fell back dead upon the blood stained earth.</p>
               <p>"Hold—for your life, strike him not. He is <emph>my</emph> prisoner!" cried
                  Arpiaka, as Chikika was about to sink his tomahawk into the lieutenant's
                  brain.</p>
               <p>The chief obeyed, while his warriors, with mad shouts, hastened, as usual, to
                  scalp and strip the slain soldiers. Arpiaka, who now supported the fainting form
                  of the wounded officer, caused several of his slaves to bear him to his lodge,
                  where, with consummate chirurgic skill, he staunched his wounds, and dressed them
                  as well as he was able. He hoped that the wounds were not mortal, although they
                  were very dangerous, for Arpiaka was not naturally hard of heart.</p>
               <p>After he had administered an opiate to the still insensible officer, he went out
                  to meet Chikika, to consult him upon their future action, first, however, telling
                  Ona, who had seen the wounded officer brought in, to watch over him, with an
                  attendant, and to notify him should the sufferer awake.</p>
               <p>The battle was over, and the presentiment of Marcus Febiger had been fulfilled—he
                  slept his last sleep, and could err no more.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXXIV.</head>
               <p>"Will the young chief of the pale-faces live?" asked Chikika, when Arpiaka
                  rejoined him.</p>
               <p>"It is doubtful!" replied the other. "His wounds are many and dangerous? Care and
                  skill may restore him—the Great Spirit only knows!"</p>
               <p>"Why does my brother seek to save his life?" asked the chief. "Is he not our
                  enemy?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but I will make him our friend. I spared him because he is a cousin to my
                  child. Is my brother angry that I should do so?"</p>
               <p>"No," replied the chief. "My brother is wise and good. Who shall question his acts
                  or dispute his will?"</p>
               <p>"Did Chikika note well the face of the man who threw himself before the young
                  chief and asked for <emph>his</emph> life, though he sued not for mercy for
                  himself!"</p>
               <p>"I did!" replied the chief. "He was a great brave, and did not fear death!"</p>
               <p>"That man was the young chief's father, I expect, from his words," continued
                  Arpiaka, "and it was he who slew my wife, and who drove me to seek refuge with my
                  red brothers!"</p>
               <p>"Does my brother want his scalp?" asked Chikika, quickly thinking, in
                     <emph>his</emph> nature, that the trophy would be valued by Arpiaka.</p>
               <p>"No," replied the latter. "Give him decent burial; I do not wish to look upon him
                  again. Bury his comrades also. They fought like brave men, and their bodies should
                  not be left to the buzzard and the crow!"</p>
               <p>"My brother's will shall be done!" replied the chief. And then he continued: "Is
                  it not likely that the pale-faces, who are many in their camp by the shore of the
                  great salt lake, will come to look after these men when they find they do not come
                  back?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Arpiaka, "and it will be best for us to go very soon to our other camp
                  in the 'Great Cypress,' where they can never come. Then you can move out with
                  small parties, and cut off their detachments while they search for us, make smokes
                  to mislead and make them weary, and make them think that we are many, and roaming
                  everywhere!"</p>
               <p>"My brother's words are wise and will please the braves! Chikika will have them
                  ready whenever my brother is prepared to go!"</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Clarence Febiger lay upon the couch where Arpiaka had placed him, breathing faint
                  and softly, yet still with good sign of life. His face was very pale, and the
                  long, dark lashes lay like a fringe of silk upon his white cheek His curling hair
                  hung in tangled clusters around his lofty forehead, and his small white hands lay
                  clasped upon his bosom, which rose and fell very gently with his suppressed
                  breathing. He looked very beautiful to Ona<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6989-00000035"
                  /> who had never before seen a young man of her own race, for he was infinitely
                  more handsome than any of the warriors whom she had seen, not even excepting the
                  noble-looking Osceola.</p>
               <p>Having sent her attendant from the room to bring some cool water, with which to
                  lave his heated brow, should he awake, she gave way to the new and unaccountable
                  sympathy which filled her bosom, and moistened her great, dark eyes, and she bent
                  over him, and kissed his white cheeks and hot brow, tenderly, while she
                  murmured:</p>
               <p>"So young, so beautiful and brave; he <emph>must</emph> not die!"</p>
               <p>Her kisses seemed to bring some sweet memory to the sleeper's tranced brain, for
                  he murmured something, while a smile seemed, like sunlight on snow, to come and go
                  upon his face. She bent down her head to catch those words, while a strange fire
                  flashed in her eyes, and a flush reddened her cheek.</p>
               <p>How strange it is that the <emph>moment</emph> which gives birth to
                     <emph>love</emph>, also brings <emph>jealousy</emph> into existence.</p>
               <p>She listened, and a glad smile came over her face, for his words were: "mother,
                  dear mother!"</p>
               <p>"I, too, had once a mother," she murmured, and the hot tears fell from her eyes
                  down upon his face, as she kissed him again and again.</p>
               <p>But she blushed deeper than ever, and started back, as his eyes slowly opened.</p>
               <p>"Where am I? Dead, and in the presence of an angel?" he said, in a low tone, while
                  he looked in wonder upon the surpassingly beautiful creature before him.</p>
               <p>"You are living! I am only a woman, and grieve that you are so sadly wounded; but
                  do not talk, I will go and call my father!" said Ona, gently, and she hurried
                  out</p>
               <p>"Heavens! She speaks English, talks like a woman, pities like a woman, but she
                  looks like an angel. Where can I be?"</p>
               <p>"With a friend—one who will save your life, if you will but be quiet, and not give
                  yourself up to excitement!" said Arpiaka, entering, and giving him another opiate,
                  more powerful than the first, which had an almost immediate effect.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXV.</head>
               <p>When Clarence Febiger again awoke to consciousness, he was many miles from the
                  island, where his brave men had fallen, and where he had been wounded. Arpiaka,
                  well knowing that a search would be made for the missing party, and probably with
                  a force too large for the strength of Chikika's band, had left his island-home,
                  and gone to the secret fastness in the "Great Cypress," where he had no fear of
                  being found, and <emph>if</emph> discovered, could defend himself against almost
                  any odds.</p>
               <p>It was on the fourth day after this removal, when he permitted the wounded officer
                  to be restored to full consciousness, having kept him in a partial state of stupor
                  by the use of anodynes A dreamy vision of passing through flowery fields, and
                  again through dark and noisome byeways, where the grunt of the alligator, the hiss
                  of the serpent, and the scream of the startled bittern fell alone upon the car,
                  lingered in his <choice>
                     <sic>bewilkered</sic>
                     <corr>bewildered</corr>
                  </choice> brain. And a picture, too, of loveliness, of a pitying angel, who had
                  hovered about him, bathing his hot brow with water, and murmuring many a word of
                  tender sympathy, was in his mind.</p>
               <p>When he woke, he found himself reclining upon a most comfortable couch, in an
                  apartment dimly lighted, but airy and comfortable. The first thing which his eyes
                  rested upon was the same fairy form that greeted his eyes on his first return to
                  consciousness, after being wounded, but the moment that he opened his eyes, and
                  tried to move, she rose and glided from the room.</p>
               <p>While yet he wondered who or what she was, the tall and stately Arpiaka entered,
                  looking, with his snowy hair and majestic heard, like some weird magician of the
                  olden time. His pale face was grave, but its expression was not unkind, as he
                  advanced, and felt <unclear>of the</unclear> young officer's pulse.</p>
               <p>"Where am I?" asked Clarence.</p>
               <p>"In safety, Clarence Febiger!" said Arpiaka.</p>
               <p>"Who are you, sir, that knows my name?"</p>
               <p>"Your <emph>friend</emph>, at present, and will be, until you are well, and I can
                  send you back to your people—then, if you again take up the sword against those
                  who never wronged you or yours. <emph>then</emph> I am your enemy!"</p>
               <p>"Did I not see you among our enemies when my poor men were shot down, and I was
                  wounded?"</p>
               <p>"You did, but your name reached my car, and I spared you, saved you from those who
                  were ready to take your life!"</p>
               <p>"Am I alone left of all my detachment?"</p>
               <p>"You, alone!"</p>
               <p>"And Marston, the sergeant?"</p>
               <p>"Died as he proclaimed your name, and his relationship to you!"</p>
               <p>"Relationship to <emph>me</emph>, sir? What mystery is this?"</p>
               <p>"By his name of <hi rend="i"/>Marcus Febiger, I have long known him, and have the
                  bitterest cause to remember him, whom you seem only to have known as Marston, the
                  sergeant!"</p>
               <p>"Marcus Febiger, my father, whom for years I have not seen, and Marston—"</p>
               <p>"Were one and the same, sir! But you must not talk much until you gather
                  strength!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir, explain all to me—this is terribly strange—it seems unreal!"</p>
               <p>"No more unreal than your wounds—yet very strange, I acknowledge! When you are
                  strong, as in a few weeks you <emph>will</emph> be, then I have some questions to
                  ask you—but for the present, rest!"</p>
               <p>"This package!" said Clarence, feeling that which Marston had given to his charge,
                  "may explain something. I pray you read it to me!"</p>
               <p>"It has saved your life!" said Arpiaka, pointing to a bullet, which, having
                  pierced it, dropped from the inside of it, as he drew it from the inner pocket,
                  where it had been placed.</p>
               <p>"Please to read it to me, sir!" said the young officer.</p>
               <p>"It may contain secrets, family matters, of which I should be the last to know!"
                  said Arpiaka.</p>
               <p>"Sir, your treatment of me shows that you are a friend. Were you not, such has
                  been my course through life, that I have never <emph>had</emph> a secret to
                  conceal, a thought which I dare not utter before all men!"</p>
               <p>Thus urged, Arpiaka broke the seal, and read as follows: <q>
                     <p>"CLARENCE: <emph>Dear</emph> Clarence, chide me not, now that I dare to call
                        you that, for the seal of death will be on my brow before you open this
                        package, and this will come to you as a voice from the tomb—from the grave,
                        where, hidden from the sight of man, lays all that is mortal of him who can
                        err no more—where his evils <emph>may</emph> be forgiven, even if they are
                        not forgotten! You are my son—much as I have disgraced your angel-mother,
                        you are my <emph>son!</emph> For months I have, under your own eye, striven
                        to redeem my lost manhood, my only hope and prayer to die bravely near your
                        side, and with my last effort in life, to save you from peril of death. That
                        accomplished, death will have lost all its bitterness. Your mother then may
                        forgive. I have erred madly and desperately, but to my last errors, I was
                        driven by wrong and persecution! But of that, no more. One thing in regard
                        to your future. I am aware that wealth is yours, through your mother, yet,
                        there is a Spaniard, named Rafael de Ribera, in Havana, who honestly owes me
                        nearly, or quite, three millions of dollars. I have not the
                           <emph>proof</emph>, but a lawyer named <hi rend="i"/>Erastus Blacking—in
                        death I forgive him the wrongs he has <unclear>done has</unclear> the proof,
                        and when he knows how, and where I died, he may relent, and give the son,
                        what he would not yield the father!"</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"I know the wretch, Ribera!" said Arpiaka, as he paused, "and I also know the
                  lawyer, and when you depart I will send a letter by you to the latter, which will
                  ensure you justice. He is my business agent!"</p>
               <p>"Who, in God's name, are you?" asked Clarence.</p>
               <p>Arpiaka made no reply, but fixing his eyes upon the manuscript, resumed his
                  reading: <q>
                     <p>"I have done much wrong—wrong which cannot he forgiven on earth, even if it
                        is in heaven. Blood is on my soul. The blood of the innocent and the
                        beautiful!"</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Arpiaka paused, and groaned—"He spoke the truth—he spoke the truth! The blood of
                  poor Ione lay heavy upon his soul, even in death!"</p>
               <p>Then mastering his emotion, he read on: <q>
                     <p>"Should you ever meet Arthur Livingston and his child, tell them that your
                        father died repentant of his evil, and prayed for forgiveness with his last
                        breath!"</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"God forgive him—it is not for us to deny that which our Maker grants to every
                  penitent!" said Arpiaka.</p>
               <p>"Arthur Livingston? Was <emph>it</emph> not the name that he addressed
                     <emph>you</emph> by, when he fell, sir?"</p>
               <p>"It was! When I was known in the busy world, it was my name, and one which I never
                  dishonored; but here, among my red brothers, I am known as Arpiaka!"</p>
               <p>"The Great Prophet of the Seminoles?"</p>
               <p>"Such they call me!" said Arpiaka, and he resumed the reading of the manuscript
                  again:</p>

               <p>Arpiaka folded up the paper and returned it to Clarence, who gazed upon it in
                  silence, with a tearful eye. After a while he spoke:</p>
               <p>"He was a bad man to my mother—wild, reckless, and abusive when I was a child—and
                  he was afterward sent to prison for crime, and my mother told me to forget him,
                  and never to utter his name. But still he was my <emph>father</emph>, and his last
                  days were his best!"</p>
               <p>Noticing that the young officer was faint, Arpiaka poured out a glass of wine and
                  gave it to him.</p>
               <p>He then said: "I will leave you to your rest, now, for your rapid restoration to
                  health depends much upon your avoiding agitation."</p>
               <p>"One question, before you go, Mr. Livingston!"</p>
               <p>"Call me Arpiaka, sir—let the name of Livingston be forgotten, even as I have
                  forgotten the world!" said the latter, sternly.</p>
               <p>"Your pardon, sir—I will not again offend. The question I would ask is, who was
                  the beautiful creature, so like my ideal of an angel, that was by my side when I
                  awoke?"</p>
               <p>"She is my daughter, and from pity has assumed<pb n="70-71"
                     xml:id="VAC6989-00000036"/> sumed the duty of nurse to you, sir! But beware how
                  you speak to her of beauty, sir, or let her into a knowledge of that heartless
                  outside world from which you came, lest you make a deadly enemy of one who
                     <emph>would</emph> be your friend! She has never known the world, is soul-pure,
                  and heart-free! I would have her remain so! Do you understand me?"</p>
               <p>"I do, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Then, so long as you act with the honor which becomes a <emph>man</emph> and a
                  soldier, I shall not prevent her attendance upon you, for it seems to give her a
                  pleasure, for she has a heart as tender as it is spotless; but one word beyond the
                  mark I have laid down, and you will see her no more. Now rest!"</p>
               <p>The tone and look of Arpiaka was very serious while he uttered these words, but
                  not harsh. After he had spoken, be retired.</p>
               <p>"Soul-pure and heart-free!" repeated Clarence, as soon as he was alone. "And so
                  beautiful!"</p>
               <p>But soon the young man, wearied from his late excitement, dropped to sleep. And
                  then, with a step as noiseless as that of the evening dew, when it sinks to rest
                  upon the bosom of the rose, in came Ona, and gazed upon his face, so full of manly
                  beauty—gazed all breathlessly, with a wrapt look, as if she had found something to
                  worship there.</p>
               <p>A wreath of orange blossoms was entwined in her black hair, and she looked very
                  lovely, though somewhat pale with long watching.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
               <p>When, on the second day after his departure, Clarence Febiger did not return, the
                  officers of his regiment began to feel anxious about him, especially as the
                     <emph>prudent</emph> scout, to save himself from the charge of cowardice, which
                  had desertion of the officer implied, had multiplied the number of Indians which
                  his second examination of the signs at the head of the river indicated.</p>
               <p>In truth, Col. Harney had threatened to hang him up for leaving the party, but the
                  scout had got too used to threat, from that source, to take them much to
                  heart.</p>
               <p>Three, four days passed, and still young Febiger did not return, nor did any
                  tidings come from him. The younger officers, who were very much attached to him,
                  now began to demand loudly to be permitted to go in search of him. The commanding
                  officer at last assented, and a strong detachment was detailed for the duty.</p>
               <p>Starting early, on the morning of the fifth day, the party soon reached the head
                  of the little river, and at once pushed ahead in their canoes to the first island
                  where Clarence had encamped. Here they found his signs, but they evidently were
                  some days old.</p>
               <p>They then hurried on to the large island, which, like the other, they found
                  deserted, but here they also found that which struck sorrow to their souls.</p>
               <p>Inside one of one of the breast-works, thrown up by the Indians for defence, they
                  discovered a large mound of newly heaped earth, and upon a cross created over it
                  was inscribed these words, written in a heavy hand, either with red chalk, or
                  painted with blood: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Here rests all that is mortal of these</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">who came to rob the red-men</l>
                        <l rend="ti-4">of their homes.</l>
                        <l>Let the pale-faces remember their fate,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-3">and let us alone.</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Go back, or a like fate awaits you"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Disbelieving that all could have thus perished, the officers had the mound opened.
                  One by one the scalped and disfigured bodies were lifted out of the shallow grave,
                  until not one remained. All were counted and recognized, but that of Clarence
                  Febiger.</p>
               <p>"Poor fellow—him they have reserved for the torture!" said one.</p>
               <p>"Heaven help his poor mother, of whom he so often spoke with devotion!" said
                  another.</p>
               <p>"He may have escaped!" suggested still another.</p>
               <p>"Never would he have left his men while life was in him!" said the first speaker.
                  "He was true as steel, and knew no fear!"</p>
               <p>The bodies of the men were reinterred by their sorrowing comrades, and then the
                  enraged soldiers commenced the work of havoc and destruction upon the island. The
                  fields of corn and fruit were destroyed—the houses, some sixty or eighty in
                  number, were set on fire, and everything laid desolate, except such portion as was
                  reserved for their encampment for the night, for it was too late to go further on
                  that day.</p>
               <p>The smoke of the burning dwellings had not been in the air ten minutes, before
                  signal-smokes were seen in a dozen different directions, communicating to the
                  Indians far and near the fact, that their enemies were out in their blood-hound
                  hunt after them.</p>
               <p>"We can at least find a chance for revenge, for I go not out of the glades until
                  we take scalp for scalp!" cried the noble Fulton, <ref rend="super"
                     target="#note_009" xml:id="return_009">*</ref>
                   who was in command of the detachment, as he pointed toward the smokes.
                  "They will rally for a fight, I think," he added, "and by the Lord they shall have
                  enough of it!"</p><note place="foot" xml:id="note_009">
                     
                     <p><ref target="#return_009">*</ref>Captain F has since died—his remains are at Richmonds, Va. He was a gallant
                        officer.</p>
                  </note>
               <p>He then gave orders to post sentinels, and form the camp so as to be ready for a
                  night attack, should one occur, intending to make an early start in the morning,
                  and to try and bring the enemy to action somewhere.</p>
               <p>The night passed on very still and quietly, and when it was almost dawn the
                  commander was afoot, waiting only for light to make his preparations for an early
                  breakfast and a start.</p>
               <p>Suddenly a shot rung on the air, then another and another, and the shouts and
                  death-groans of the sentinels, which were posted around the camp, told them that
                  the foe had been awake and moving while they slept.</p>
               <p>"To your arms men, to your arms!" shouted the brave officer.</p>
               <p>The men sprung to their feet in a hurried and confused mass, for the terrible
                  war-yell rung in their ears, and while thus clustered, a killing volley was poured
                  in upon them, slaying many, wounding more.</p>
               <p>And then, like a storm, quick-coming and passing on like electric fire, the sound
                  of shot and yell ceased, all as suddenly and when the survivors were formed, and
                  charged in search of the enemy, not an Indian could be discovered. They had done
                  their work, and fled—fled without the loss of a single man. When the day dawned,
                  not an Indian could be seen, nor even a trace found by which they could be
                  pursued. The only proof, and it was a dreadful one, which showed that they had
                  been there, was the cold corses of the dead, and the writhing bodies of the
                  wounded, who lay stretched upon the ground. The blow had been as heavy as it was
                  sudden. Nearly one-third of the force was slain or disabled. The commander had not
                  the power now, even if he wished, to advance; his wounded must be taken back,
                  where they could be properly eared for, and his force was too small to divide.</p>
               <p>The survivors buried their dead with sad hearts, raising a new mound beside that
                  which had been reared by the Indians over Febiger's even more unfortunate party.
                  And then Fulton, with a heavy heart, gave orders to re-embark, and turned his face
                  back toward the headquarters of his regiment. His mortification was intense, yet
                  he was not to blame, for he had used every precaution for defence, and his
                  sentinels were properly posted. But, during all of that war, the Indian policy was
                  to fire suddenly from an ambuscade, and then retreat; or, upon a sleeping camp,
                  and then fly. And seldom did they lose a man, while the whites invariably lost
                  more or less, and generally officers were more singled out than private men.</p>
               <p>In one case, that of the brave Captain Russell, of the Third Artillery, he
                  received eleven balls, while not another man was touched in the boat in which he
                  was killed. The Indians at that time fled, without the loss of a man.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVII.</head>
               <p>Weeks passed on, and Clarence Febiger had so much improved, that he could walk out
                  a short distance from the lodge of Arpiaka, and as he had given his word of honor
                  to the latter not to attempt to escape, but to wait until Arpiaka could safely
                  send him to the camp of the United States forces, he was permitted to do so,
                  without any other attendant than Ona, who seemed never to tire of his company, and
                  who would sit for hours and listen, while he read from some favorite author, out
                  of her father's small but well-selected library. Books which she had read and
                  re-read, were new to her, when their contents came upon <emph>his</emph> mellow
                  voice. Arpiaka might have known how dangerous this was, if he wished her to be
                  still kept heart-free, but he was constantly occupied with chiefs, who came to him
                  with news, or asked advice and counsel, and he did not seem to notice it.
                  Perchance he trusted implicitly to the honor of him whom he had cautioned. Yet he
                  should have remembered that love is blind—blind to honor, prudence, everything but
                  the object of its infatuation.</p>
               <p>And perhaps he had not cautioned <emph>her</emph>, deemed her so all unused to the
                  thought of such a sentiment, except as she felt an attachment naturally for
                  himself, that he considered it unnecessary.</p>
               <p>He should have known that love is of sudden and spontaneous growth; that, as the
                  seed blown with the thistle's down is carried to spots considered almost
                  inaccessible, so love, in its mysterious wanderings, takes root where it is least
                  expected.</p>
               <p>And in spite of all caution, regardless of danger, drinking in her glorious beauty
                  through his enraptured eyes, Clarence had learned to <emph>love</emph>, nay more,
                  to idolize her!—to feel that he could not live away from her side! He had
                  forgotten the call of duty; not a thought of his comrades and friends seemed to
                  enter his mind; and of his mother, he only spoke when Ona alluded to her.</p>
               <p>But he did not tell his love, or at least did not speak of it in
                     <emph>words</emph>, though by many a heaving sigh, by many a speaking glance,
                  by many a flush coming and going on his hot <unclear>cheek</unclear>, she could
                  see that he felt that, which, in honor to her father's wish, he dare not
                  utter.</p>
               <p>And we <emph>could not</emph> conceal, if we <emph>would</emph>, the fact that she
                  was no longer heart-free. She had pitied him from the first, and sympathy is so
                  near akin to love, that its wedlock is almost an unnecessary form. Yes, Ona loved
                  Clarence <emph>very</emph> dearly—she did not know how much, until she heard her
                  father tell him, one day, that as soon as he was a little stronger, he should be
                  sent back to his people. And though she checked the emotion which sent the blood
                  from her cheek back to her quivering heart, the words seemed like a death-knell to
                  her every hope.</p>
               <p>That evening, when they walked out in a magnolia grove, in whose fragrant shade
                  they were wont to sit, she turned to him, and abruptly asked, as she looked him in
                  the eye, seeking there a readier answer than from his lips:</p>
               <p>"Do you wish to go back to your people?"</p>
               <p>"I did once—but I do not now! I am <emph>very</emph> happy here!" was his
                  answer.</p>
               <p>"Then why do you think of going?"</p>
               <p>"I am your father's captive—I must go where he sends me!" he answered, sadly.</p>
               <p>"You shall not go! I will not let him send you away! I would die without you!" she
                  cried, with passionate energy, and she clasped one of his hands in her own, and
                  kissed it ardently.</p>
               <p>What, after hearing such an avowal, would have been his answer, we cannot say, for
                  a dark shadow came between them and the rays of the setting sun, and as they
                  looked up they saw a dark-browed Indian chief, and five stalwart warriors, rushing
                  upon them.</p>
               <p>"Coacoochee!" cried Ona, and her wild shriek rung loud upon the air.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and Coacoochee has come for the 'White Dove,' and a pale-faced lover's
                  scalp!" yelled the savage, as he sprung forward.</p>
               <p>But his conquest was not to be made without a struggle. Clarence, though still
                  weak, was as brave as a lion, and withal cool and active. Bidding Ona to fly to
                  her father's camp for aid, he snatched the dagger from her belt, and threw himself
                  in the way of the advancing warriors, dodging a blow aimed by the chief with his
                  hatchet, and the next instant striking the dagger home to the hearts of two
                  warriors, who endeavored to close with and seize him. The next instant he grappled
                  Coacoochee, who, with a mighty effort, cast him to the earth, and then rushed
                  after Ona, who had fled toward her father's camp, shrieking for help.</p>
               <p>And help came, not a second too soon, for the villain's grasp was almost upon her,
                  when the tall form of Chikika, and twenty or more other warriors, was seen
                  bounding toward him.</p>
               <p>"The 'White Dove' escapes this time, but the shall yet be mine!" he yelled, as he
                  turned and fled toward his canoe, which lay near where Clarence had been stricken
                  down, and still remained insensible from the shock.</p>
               <p>His pursuers were close behind him, but as his fiery eye rested upon the prostrate
                  form of the officer, a yell of fury burst from his lips, and, drawing his knife,
                  he plunged it to the hilt in the breast of the helpless man. He had no time to
                  take his coveted scalp, for Chikika was very near, and his terrified warriors were
                  already in the canoe. One bound, and he was with them, and they were speeding away
                  as fast as they could paddle, leaving two of their number by the side of Clarence,
                  like him, bleeding, but unlike him—<emph>dead!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Ona followed close upon the footsteps of Chikika and his braves, and casting
                  herself down upon the body of poor Clarence, moaned and sobbed as if her heart was
                  breaking.</p>
               <p>"I am saved, but he whom I love more than life, is lost—is lost!" she cried.</p>
               <p>Clarence heard her words, and though he believed with her, that he was dying, he
                  smiled, and whispered, "Ona, <emph>dear</emph> Ona, your words are worth dying
                  for! I am happy now, for I could not live without you!"</p>
               <p>She heeded not that the eyes of Chikika and his warriors were upon her; she did
                  not rise even when she heard her stern father's voice, but wildly kissing his pale
                  lips, and trying with her white hand to staunch the blood flowing from the ghastly
                  wound, she moaned her grief and her love in rapid, half-incoherent words.</p>
               <p>"Rise, Ona, rise, and let me attend to his wound!" said Arpiaka, almost
                  sternly.</p>
               <p>"Oh, my father! he has saved me from worse than death; but he will die, he will
                  die! But I too will die, for I cannot live without him!" she cried.</p>
               <p>A dark and gloomy frown was upon Arpiaka's brow, but he gently raised Ona from her
                  position, and examined the wound of Clarence.</p>
               <p>"The knife has not reached a mortal part," said he; "if I can staunch the
                  hemorrhage, he will live!"</p>
               <p>A low cry of gladness burst from Ona's lips, and she sobbed no more, for those
                  words had wakened the dying hope in her fond, pare bosom.</p>
               <p>Taking a scarf from her neck, and using a handkerchief for a compressure, Arpiaka
                  made a temporary bandage for the wound, and then bade four of the strongest
                  warriors carry him carefully to his lodge, while he with Chikika walked slowly
                  behind, drawing from Ona a full account of Coacoochie's daring attempt and the
                  desperate bravery of Clarence, who, weak as he was, had slain two armed warriors
                  with her dagger, and struggled hand to hand with the fierce chief himself, who was
                  accounted a match for the first warriors of the tribe.</p>
               <p>"He has acted nobly in <emph>this</emph> case, but basely in another, and you must
                  see him no more!" said Arpiaka, quietly, but firmly, to his astonished
                  daughter.</p>
               <p>"In what has he acted basely, my father—he, who is all honor, the soul of all
                  nobleness?"</p>
               <p>"Although I warned him not to attempt it, on his peril, he has won thy love!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Won</emph> my love, my father? It was no fault of his! I gave it him the
                  hour we met—long, long before he unclosed his eyes from his death-like sleep; long
                  before the music of his voice fell upon my ear! He has never spoken of love to
                  me—never sought my affection! Freely I gave him that, which he never
                     <emph>asked</emph> for—my whole heart's boundless love!"</p>
               <p>"Silence, girl! Remember only that his father slew thy mother!"</p>
               <p>"You have told me yourself, father, that Clarence was not born, nor his father
                  wedded, when that cruel deed was done. Wherefore, then, blame him for that which
                  occurred when he was not in existence. I am nearly three years his senior, am a
                  woman, with all of a woman's heart, throbbing <choice>
                     <sic>maddly</sic>
                     <corr>madly</corr>
                  </choice> in my bosom. Oh, my father, if you love me, do not break that heart. Do
                  not drive me from his side, but let me nurse him as before! Remember that for
                     <emph>me</emph> he suffers, for <emph>me</emph> his life is imperilled!"</p>
               <p>Tears rolled from her beseeching eyes while she spoke; and softened, yet still
                  stern, Arpiaka said:</p>
               <p>"If thou wilt speak to him no more of love, and do but thy duty as a
                     <emph>nurse</emph>, I will not hinder thee! Dry up thy tears, my child!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</head>
               <p>The anger of the commander of the forces at the mouth of the Miama, was fearful,
                  when the remains of the last detachment returned, and reported their loss, and the
                  fate of that which had been led by Clarence Febiger. Imprecations from that source
                  were too common to be unexpected, or seriously heeded; but they came with an
                  ill-grace from a man who, but a short time afterwards, was himself surprised
                  through utter carelessness, and all of his command, excepting only one man and
                  himself, cut off.</p>
               <p>After venting his abuse upon the officers who had just returned, and upon the
                  memory of Clarence Febiger, supposed to be slain, he swore a terrible oath, that,
                  with all the force which he could muster, he would enter the everglades, and,
                  dogging the Indians from island to island, and into their secret hiding places,
                  would shoot and hang every one whom he could find, refusing quarter in every case.
                  But loud as his words at that juncture, he was too prudent to put his threats into
                  execution until his force was increased, for the two last lessons his men had
                  received, had taught him that the Indian for was not to be despised. Leaving him
                  waiting for expected reinforcements we will look a little further down the Florida
                  Reef, and draw the curtain aside from a tragedy of real occurrence, to show that
                  Chikika and his braves were not idle, and understood the <emph>civilized</emph>
                  and custom-sanctioned law of retaliation which has ever been practiced by motions
                  at war. <emph>Their</emph> houses had been burned, and their crops destroyed, and
                  they thought that a little fire and destruction by way of reprisal, might teach
                  their pale-faced enemies more caution.</p>
               <p>About ninety miles to the south-west of Cape Florida, was a small islet of ten or
                  twelve across, occupied by a man, whose history, if <emph>all</emph> were
                  revealed, would throw romance into the shade. He was reported, while a mere boy,
                  to have ran away from Staten Island with a sloop about the size of a market boat,
                  belonging to his father; but the particulars of that marine elopement were never
                  fully understood, for <emph>he</emph> was always as <emph>mum</emph> as a "Know
                  Nothing" when the subject was alluded to.</p>
               <p>One thing was certain that many years before, when the difference between wrecking
                  and piracy was to minute as to be scarcely discernible, he appeared on the reef
                  with a small sloop and entered into the business with an earnestness which
                  indicated that a fortune, and nothing short of a fortune, was what he aimed at.
                  His crew consisted of a half-dozen youngsters like himself—not one of them over
                  twenty years of age, a negro cook, black as his own kettles, and forty-seven
                  degrees uglier than any <hi rend="i"/>Caliban that ever was made up for
                  Shakspere's Tempest—and a very "strong-minded" young lady some older than himself,
                  whom he had picked up on his way out, in Charleston, and who occupied the position
                  of <emph>his</emph> mate, although another mate was on the sloop's muster-roll. In
                  after years a question arose, which could not be so settled as to entitle her to
                  property left by him, whether or not her shipping articles had been legally drawn
                  up and blessed with priestly ceremony; but at any rate, she appeared on the reef
                  at that time, as Mrs. Jake Housman, for that was the name of our hero.</p>
               <p>It would fill a volume, were I to relate one twentieth part of the stories told of
                  the early career of this daring young wrecker on the reef, who, though the most
                  reckless of his class, was seldom <emph>wreckless</emph> when there had been a
                  gale in the gulf heavy enough "to put them on." Tales of "false lights," of
                  vessels stripped, of crews saved, yet who never reached the shore,
                     <emph>were</emph> told, yet, as they <emph>were</emph> tales and traditions,
                  coming down from lip to lip, they must be received as such with many an inch of
                  "allowance for stretching," the more especially that the hero of them has gone to
                  his last reckoning and is no more accountable on earth. <ref rend="super"

               <p>He had built between thirty and forty neat cottages on the island, a large and
                  splendidly-furnished house for himself, several warehouses, and a large and
                  well-stocked store, in which could be found everything from rum to cologne water,
                  a jewsharp to a sheet anchor, a monkey-jacket to a satin dress—in fact, "anything
                  and everything which could be called for"—as his chief clerk, Daddy Somerindyke,
                  used to say. His houses were tenanted solely by people in his own employ, for—with
                  one exception—he was never known to let any one live upon the island who was not,
                  literally, soul and body, at his command.</p>
               <p>That exception was the celebrated naturalist, Doctor Perrine, whose labors and
                  discoveries in the field of science were much valued, and who, in the very height
                  of his usefulness, was cut off, as will shortly appear.</p>
               <p>At this time, Captain Housman owned several of the finest wrecking sloops on the
                  reef, and could not have been worth less than three hundred thousand dollars, and
                  probably more, and was very rapidly "piling up" dollars upon this heap And having
                  thus introduced him, with a perspicuity which truth required, we will ring up the
                  curtain on the tragedy.</p>
               <p>Upon a balmy night in the delicious summer time, when the breeze from the Gulf
                  Stream came gently in and kissed the trees and flowers on the little islet, the
                  inhabitants retired, in peace and quietness, to slumber, without a fear in their
                  bosoms; for, from the commencement of the war until then, no Indians had been
                  known to approach the Key, although, before the war, they often came to Housman's
                  store to buy powder and lead, and calicoes and paints.</p>
               <p>Doctor Perrine, with his interesting family, consisting of an amiable wife, two
                  very beautiful and intelligent daughters, and a young son, occupied a house close
                  on the water side, fitted up with an observatory, and arranged for his studious
                  pursuits. Near him was Mr. Howe, the postmaster, and but a hundred yards or so
                  distant was the residence of Housman. The cottages, which, fortunately, were not
                  all occupied at the time, formed the fronts of a hollow square, with neat little
                  gardens in their rear.</p>
               <p>All was still, balmy, and dreamy, that night, and on until about two o'clock in
                  the morning. Then, had sentinels been on the alert, gazing out upon the moonlit
                  waters, they would have seen a long, dark line of canoes coming, like a shadow,
                  from the inner bay toward the main land—coming so still that the dip of a paddle
                  in the flashing water could not be heard, nor even the ripple of the sharp prows
                  as they severed the waves. But no wakeful sentinel was there to warn the
                  inhabitants of their danger.</p>
               <p>The canoes reached the shore one by one, and soon their dusky crews, to the number
                  of over two hundred well-armed warriors, stood upon the land, with Chikika at
                  their head. In a low tone he gave his orders, directing each party to creep in
                  silence to its destined post, while he, with some of his trustiest men, proceeded
                  to the store, in which he knew there was a large quantity of liquor, which he
                  wished to destroy, lest some of his men should get at it and lose themselves in
                  drunkenness, for he knew that his work must be quickly done, and his fastness in
                  the Big Cypress regained, for there were limited States forces very near at hand,
                  and pursuit would inevitably be made.</p>
               <p>It was nearly dawn—not lacking, at most, over an hour—when all was ready, and the
                  fearful war-whoop rung loud and wild from the lips of Chikika. In an instant, it
                  was echoed from the stentorian lungs of two hundred braves. And, at the same
                  instant, fire was applied to nearly every one of the cottages at once, though
                  Chikika yet spared the store and larger houses, intending to plunder them before
                  he destroyed them.</p>
               <p>Up from their dreamy beds sprung the affrighted people! Some of them rushed
                  instantly out, and met death on the threshold of their own doors; others shrank
                  back in terror, and perished in the flames. How any could escape in alone a
                  mystery.</p>
               <p>Captain Housman and his lady, with no garments on but their night robes, sprung
                  from a back window of the bedroom as the Indians burst in their front door, and,
                  creeping through a grove of fig trees, gained the water-side; whence, supporting
                  his wife, the bold wrecker swam over channels and waded over coral reefs, which
                  cut his flesh in to the bone, until he reached a hiding-place upon a mangrove
                  island. A brother of Mr. Goodyear, the great India-rubber man, escaped almost by a
                  miracle, having been, at one time, immersed in a cistern beneath a burning
                  warehouse.</p>
               <p>But the fate of poor Doctor Perrine and the sufferings of his family deserve our
                  attention now. At the first alarm he sprung from his bed, and aroused his wife and
                  terrified children. As yell after yell broke upon their cars, death, terrible and
                  inevitable, seemed to be their doom. But the doctor's ready mind instantly hit
                  upon a temporary hiding-place for them. Back of his house and communicating with
                  it, was a boat-wharf, and strong stakes had been driven down all around it in the
                  water, to form a pen in which to keep living turtles. Directing them to crawl out
                  in this pen under the wharf, and hide there up to their necks in water, he said
                  that he would go up to the cupola and address the Indians in Spanish, which he
                  spoke fluently, for many of them understood it, and he hoped to make terms with
                  them, as he was a noncombatant, and had no connection with their enemies in arms.
                  Hurried off only in their night robes, the wife and delicate daughters, and the
                  brave little boy crept out into the water, and soon they heard the husband and
                  father speaking from his cupola or observatory. But a yell from the Indians
                  drowned his voice, which they never heard more The crash of broken doors, the
                  yells of the plunderers<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6989-00000039"/> erers, and the
                  crackling of flames came rapidly one after the other.</p>
               <p>Intense as was now their mental agony—widowed and fatherless in an instant—they
                  were doomed to suffer yet a horrible torture. As the flames of the burning
                  dwelling rose, the heat became great, blistering their fair and delicate skins,
                  and rendering them the most intense agony. When at last the wharf, under which
                  they lay, took fire, it became evident that they must be roasted slowly to death,
                  or else escape from their hiding-place. But how to escape when all was as light as
                  day, and the merciless savages on hand all around to slay every one whom they
                  found, was a question which seemed to defy a solution.</p>
               <p>But now the <emph>man</emph> in young Perrine exhibited itself. He could see a
                  boat which was moored at a little distance, and to this he swam, keeping as low
                  down in the water as he could to avoid observation. Detaching the boat from its
                  mooring, he swam slowly back, that it might appear to be drifting in. Soon it was
                  by the little wharf, and the scorched and blistered mother and sisters, who had
                  only preserved life by frequently immersing themselves under the water, crept into
                  it, and the young hero, while they lay concealed in its bottom, swam away with it
                  in tow, and soon was beyond the reach of the savages, who were now engaged in
                  plundering the store, where a large quantity of powder, lead, knives, axes,
                  muskets, and rifles, as well as calicoes, cloths, tobacco, etc., attracted all
                  their attention. If memory serves me right, that boy-<emph>man</emph> was only
                  eleven years old, and his heroism deserves a bright page in the annals of
                  history.</p>
               <p>Day dawned at last, and revealed only blazing building and blackened ruins, while
                  the Indians were loading their own canoes, and several boats which they found at
                  the key, with their plunder.</p>
               <p>A gallant young officer, Midshipman Francis Key Murray, was on Tea-Table Key, some
                  two miles distant, with only ten or twelve sick men, who had been left there in a
                  temporary hospital. Although only four or five of these were able to pull an oar,
                  he forced them into a large barge, which mounted one gun, and made them pull
                  within a quarter of a mile or less of the island, where he opened such a fire upon
                  the enemy, that they hastily took to their boats and canoes and left, after
                  returning his fire, and severely wounding some of his men. He kept up his fire
                  until his gun recoiled overboard, and then he devoted himself to picking up the
                  fugitives who had escaped destruction. He also instantly despatched a light
                  sail-boat, with a couple of men, to the United States schooners Wane and Otsego,
                  up the reef, for assistance, and the latter, of which the author hereof was then
                  acting first lieutenant, was soon under way, and arrived at the scene of
                  desolation while the ruins were yet smoking, and the bodies of the dead lay
                  sweltering in gore or scorching by the fire.</p>
               <p>It was a pitiful sight to see those who had escaped, scorched and blistered by the
                  heat, their limbs cut and bleeding from the sharp reefs of coral, most of them
                  nearly naked! Yet it was a merciful and wonderful Providence which spared their
                  lives. Our sheets and blankets were at once given to the ladies to make temporary
                  clothing with, for they had not saved anything, and our own wardrobes were opened
                  to the men. Meantime hurried preparations were made to pursue the Indians, and
                  soon a boat expedition was in their wake. But they had too much start, and gained
                  the everglades in safety.</p>
               <p>When we returned to the blackened island, it was occupied by the marines of the
                  naval expedition, under command of a brave but eccentric officer, Lieutenant
                  Thomas Sloan, whose remains now rest in the burial-ground attached to the Naval
                  Hospital near Brooklyn. He had gathered the remains of the murdered people
                  together, and buried them in a large grave, at the head of which a board was
                  placed, and upon it, with his usual oddity, well-meant, however, he placed the
                  following inscription:</p>
               <p>"Here lays all the mortal remains of a numerous lot of men, women, and children,
                  who were cruelly butchered by the bloody Indians on this island. May the Lord take
                  a liking to their souls!"</p>
               <p>Poor Sloan, he was a gallant Kentuckian, beloved by all who knew him. He never
                  recovered from the hardships and sufferings of that sickening war, as not one in
                  ten did who endured them, and fell all too early into the hands of unsparing
                  death.</p>
               <p>This chapter, which has been strictly historical, has been given to the reader,
                  more to show the strength, skill, and cunning of the so-called savages in that
                  war, than because it had a direct connection with other of our characters than
                  Chikika and his braves.</p>
               <p>With this explanation, I will now return to those whom, I presume, the reader
                  feels the most interested in.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIX.</head>
               <p>Slowly, yet more rapidly than before, Clarence recovered from the wound which he
                  had received from the hand of Coacoochee. For now, though neither of them
                     <emph>spoke</emph> of it, except through their ardent glances, he knew that
                  she, whom he so worshiped in his <emph>heart</emph> of <emph>hearts</emph>,
                  returned his love, with a passion fierce as flame and all as pure. And his life,
                  seeming a part of his love, grew strong with the hope that she would yet be his,
                  his own forever—that he could return, not <emph>alone</emph> when he went back to
                  his mother, but bearing upon his breast a flower, fit to grow in Paradise, a jewel
                  more precious than ought else on earth.</p>
               <p>He soon grew so strong that he could again walk forth, leaning upon her arm, but
                  he could not now, as before, go unobserved with her into the shady recesses of the
                  flowery groves, for with the good excuse that Coacoochee might be hovering near,
                  Arpiaka never let them move outside of his lodge without a guard.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>He</emph> was busy as ever, for Micanopee had been taken and sent west, and
                  though not so lineally, yet he was regarded literally as the head of the nation,
                  and all expeditions were made only after his advice had been asked, and his
                  directions given. He it was who counseled the attack upon Indian Key, for he knew
                  how sadly the Indians needed ammunition, and that plenty could be got on that
                  island. He it was who sent out small parties of fleet young warriors, to attack
                  the most distant posts and settlements, so as to lead the soldiers away from his
                  own immediate vicinity, and to make them believe that the Indians were ten times
                  as numerous as they really were. Strange, yet true, that his long residence with
                  the red men, and his remembrance of wrongs inflicted on him and his, made him hate
                  the pale-faces full as bitterly as the fiercest of the warriors.</p>
               <p>It was several weeks after Clarence had received his wound, and Chikika had just
                  returned in triumph from his attack upon Indian Key, when the young officer, who
                  had just returned from a walk with Ona, was met by Arpiaka in his lodge, who
                  addressed him on the subject of his return to his people:</p>
               <p>"You are strong enough to travel, now, Lieutenant Febiger!" said he. "I will
                  redeem my promise, made to you long since. You shall go back to your people. I
                  will send you with a guard, who will leave you as near the fort as they can go,
                  with safety to themselves, and you can then tell your people that wronged as we
                  are, we can sometimes be merciful and generous!"</p>
               <p>The cheek of Ona grew more white, if possible, than the magnolia, which lay
                  nestled in purity, on her soft bosom, when she heard these words.</p>
               <p>Clarence, too, turned pale, and trembled, but made no reply.</p>
               <p>Arpiaka <emph>did</emph> notice the appearance of both of them, and marked their
                  agitation, but he appeared not to, but continued his remarks:</p>
               <p>"When you see your mother, you may tell her that more for her sake, and for the
                  sake of the little link of blood between you and my lost Ione, I spared you, and
                  that Ione's murderer is no more! If you think, after all that has passed, that you
                  can still war upon these poor people, who only ask for peace and quiet on their
                  native soil, I shall extract no pledge from you not to do so; for you will have to
                  resign your commission, or obey orders from your superiors."</p>
               <p>"Never—<emph>never</emph> will I raise a hand against a Seminole, except as I did
                  with Coacoochee's brave—in defence of life, or <emph>one</emph> whom I hold more
                  dear than life!" exclaimed Clarence, looking first at Arpiaka, and then at his
                  daughter.</p>
               <p>The father frowned when he heard his closing words, and in a harsh, hasty tone,
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Your memory is either very treacherous, sir, or else your <emph>honor</emph> is
                  held all too lightly! Have I not bidden you not to speak of love in
                     <emph>her</emph> ears?"</p>
               <p>"Chide him not, my father. Let it suffice that, in dividing <unclear>us</unclear>,
                  you will break both our hearts!" said Ona, in a low tone—almost a sob.</p>
               <p>"Silence, girl—speak when you are spoken to!" said Arpiaka,
                     <unclear>sternly</unclear>. Then, turning to Clarence, he said: "Young man, be
                  ready to go on the morrow."</p>
               <p>"I do not wish to go," said Clarence "Let me be a captive still: I will not try to
                  escape; I will hunt with your hunters, and be no burden to you!"</p>
               <p>"Will you go to the battle with our warriors, and fight your former comrades?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir, <emph>no!</emph> Arpiaka would not <unclear>ask that</unclear>!" cried
                  the officer. "And if he did, I would die before I would comply with his wish!"</p>
               <p>"You would not do it even to win his daughter for thy bride?" and Arpiaka closely
                  scanned his face, while he waited for a reply.</p>
               <p>"No, sir, not even to win her whom I worship<pb n="78-79"
                     xml:id="VAC6989-00000040"/>
                  <emph>ship</emph>, forgetting even my God!" replied Clarence.</p>
               <p>"It is well! I do not ask the sacrifice! Be ready to go to-morrow!" said Arpiaka,
                  and then he strode away from the room.</p>
               <p>For a moment. Ona and Clarence stood and looked at each other, then tearfully
                  rushed together, and embraced.</p>
               <p>"Never, never, will I leave you, my angel! I will die here, for life without you
                  were a load too heavy to bear!" said Clarence.</p>
               <p>"Go, brave, <emph>dear</emph> Clarence," said Ona, "but you shall not go alone. I
                  will be with you, for my heart tells me that it owes no duty but to you.
                     <emph>You</emph> are my love, my very soul, my life, my <emph>all!</emph>"</p>
               <p>And her burning kisses were thrown like scattering rose leaves upon his brow, his
                  eyes, his cheeks and lips.</p>
               <p>"But your father will use force to prevent it! You will be kept back, and woe, woe
                  to me then!"</p>
               <p>"No—go you, as if you had nerved your heart to part with me forever. Manage to
                  make your departure as late in the day as possible. Then when night falls, alone
                  in my light canoe I will follow, for well I know each win ling turn of the
                  channel, and before the night is passed, I will be beyond your camp, and will meet
                  you when the warriors leave you. Though they will not see <emph>me</emph>, I will
                  not love sight of you!"</p>
               <p>"Angel, I <emph>hope</emph>, yet I tremble for your safety. Should your father
                  pursue, you might be taken, but worst of <emph>all</emph>, should you meet
                  Coacoochee, who is prowling, we know not where—"</p>
               <p>"I will be so armed that our next meeting will be the last for him! I am no child,
                  Clarence!"</p>
               <p>"No, my brave, my beautiful, my <emph>own</emph> Ona. no! You have the spirit of a
                  thousand warriors, and hope once more gladdens my heart I will do as you
                  direct!"</p>
               <p>"Do not let your joy or hope be seen in your face!" said Ona. "Like me, appear sad
                  and sorrowful, the better to disguise our intentions!"</p>
               <p>Again the lovers renewed their kisses and their vows, and then separated, each to
                  wear a mask, a new thing to their artless and truthful natures.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XL.</head>
               <p>Different in numbers and equipment, was the third expedition which started from
                  the mouth of the Miami, for the everglades, from either of the unfortunate ones
                  which had preceded it. Heavier boats, more men, thoroughly armed, and well <choice>
                     <sic>provisoned</sic>
                     <corr>provisioned</corr>
                  </choice> for a lengthy cruise, were those which formed this "army of invasion."
                  And the better to conceal his approach, the commanding officer determined to enter
                  the glades in the night, and to move as little as possible in the day, and thus to
                  surprise the Indians on their islands, and to secure guides, whom he intended, by
                  torture or bribes, to force into leading him to the strongholds and camps of their
                  tribe.</p>
               <p>Ah, little did he know of the stern integrity of that noble race—of their honesty
                  of heart, their courage and their fortitude. But he was doomed to learn it, ere he
                  had passed through that campaign, or even much more than commenced his trip.</p>
               <p>Coming stealthily to the small island, where Clarence had first encamped, the
                  van-guard found an Indian canoe at the landing, and creeping quietly up, at a
                  camp-fire in the bushes, found there, and secured a warrior and his squaw, and two
                  children, who had encamped for the night.</p>
               <p>Extinguishing the fire, the commander halted his men there, as it was nearly
                  morning, forbidding any of them to show themselves outside of the bushes, and also
                  having his boats hauled up out of sight, so that no straggling scout should
                  observe them.</p>
               <p>When the day dawned, he had the captive warrior brought up, and finding that he
                  spoke English, demanded if he would show him where the villages of Chikika and
                  other chiefs were.</p>
               <p>"No!" said the Indian, sullenly.</p>
               <p>"I will give you a rifle and new blankets, and plenty of tobacco and whiskey, if
                  you will!" said the commander.</p>
               <p>"Me no want 'em!" replied the Indian.</p>
               <p>"I'll shoot you, if you don't!"</p>
               <p>"Shoot! me no <unclear>'fraid</unclear>. Look there!" and he showed <emph>ten
                     notches</emph> on the handle of his scalping-knife, each counting one for
                  scalps taken from his enemies. Me pay for life long ago—s'pose me see you first
                  last night. I count one more. Good scalp, yours, red like fire!" and the Indian
                  smiled, grimly.</p>
               <p>"You cursed Indian dog, I'll hang you!" shouted the infuriated officer.</p>
               <p>"Hang, damn, <emph>hang!</emph> Me only die once!" said the warrior,
                  scornfully.</p>
               <p>"Bring a rifle here—I'll see what stuff he is made of!" shouted the commander.</p>
               <p>The order was obeyed, and by his directions, one end of the rope was thrown over
                  the limb of a live-oak, and the other fastened in a slipping noose around the
                  warrior's neck. His hands being bound behind him and his feet tied together, he
                  could not have offered resistance, if he would.</p>
               <p>"Run him up!" said the officer.</p>
               <p>In a moment the brave fellow was swinging in the air. Full as long as he dared to
                  let him hang, and yet keep life in him, the officer kept him suspended, and then
                  gave the order to lower him away, and bade the surgeon to resuscitate him, so that
                  he could again be questioned.</p>
               <p>It was with considerable difficulty, that by bathing his temples and throat, and
                  administering liquor, the poor fellow could be brought too, but at last he was
                  once more conscious.</p>
               <p>The commander bent down, and, looking him in the eye, asked, in a sneering tone.
                  "How do you like hanging, you red dog?"</p>
               <p>"Me like 'um much! How you like whiskey?" said the Indian, fiercely, as he spat
                  the mouthful of whiskey, which the surgeon had given to him, full into the face of
                  the commander.</p>
               <p>With a yell of rage the officer drew his sword, and, forgetting what he wanted to
                  force out of the prisoner, drove the sword home to the very hilt in his bosom.</p>
               <p>"Ugh! Long knife much good! Big coward, <emph>you</emph>!" grunted the Indian, and
                  then, without a groan, he fell back, dead!</p>
               <p>The squaw and children looked on in horror, but in silence, while the husband,
                  father and protector thus suffered and died.</p>
               <p>To them the commander now turned, swearing that they, too, should perish. And a
                  man who could whip a negro woman to death, in Tennessee, would not be likely to
                  spare a poor, helpless squaw, in war-time; but men were there, officers and
                  gentlemen, who would not permit such an outrage to be committed without
                  remonstrance and opposition. He knew it, and was content to utter only curses and
                  threats.</p>
               <p>Ordering the body of the Indian to be hung up, as a terror to others who might
                  come that way, the commander now bade his men take rest, as he meant to remain
                  there until night would again conceal his movements.</p>
               <p>He also posted men up in the umbrageous tops of several of the loftiest trees, to
                  watch for smokes upon other islands, and to detect any boat which might
                  approach.</p>
               <p>Thus we will leave him, for the present.</p>

               <p>As <emph>she</emph> had wished, evincing great reluctance to go, and exhibiting
                  the most profound sorrow. Clarence delayed his departure all that he could upon
                  the day which was set for his return.</p>
               <p>Ona did not make her appearance, but taught to be artful by the exigency of the
                  case, she seemed to be utterly lost in grief, and locked herself in her apartment.
                  But in truth she was preparing to follow him to whom she was already wedded in
                  heart, and to whom she was ready to entrust life, honor and everything. Her
                  preparations were simple, yet there were things watch she did not wish to leave
                  behind. One was a packet which her father had given to her care long before, and
                  when he, at the time, told her contained the proof of her birth, a copy of her
                  grandfather's will, and other papers which would be of meat value to her, if he
                  should be out off, and she should over go out into the world again. And she also
                  took after loading them carefully, a pair of fine pistols and a large dagger,
                  which she easily concealed beneath the Indian costume which she wore. And some
                  rare and costly jewels and money, too, she selected, for she knew that such things
                  might be useful in a world where gold is the god of two-thirds of its people.</p>
               <p>Tired with the various excuses and delays which Clarence made, Arpiaka, who had
                  given him the letter that he had promised, introducing him to Blacking and
                  advising that worthy to give him the proof to require his rights from Ribera, told
                  him, for about the fortieth time, that the warriors were ready, four of them in a
                  canoe, to take him out to the fort on the Miami.</p>
               <p>"May I not say farewell to Ona, before I go?" asked the young man. "I have waited
                  to see her, but all the day she has kept within her room!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and wisely. Parting words will make both your hearts heavier I grieve for
                  you both, but you are young, and young hearts are forgetful. Had your father not
                  slain her mother, I would not thus separate ye, but that bar of blood lies between
                  ye, and it must not be passed! I have spoken! Go, and my blessing go with
                  you!"</p>
               <p>"May I not take the arms which I wore when I was captured?" asked the young
                  officer. Perchance I might meet the faithless Coacoochy before I reached the fort
                  and if I were unarmed, he might be more than a match for me!"</p>
               <p>"It is true; your request is but reasonable. It shall be granted to you!"</p>
               <p>And Arpiaka went and brought Clarence his two revolvers and his sword, and at the
                  same time put a purse of gold in his hand, saying: "Should you resign, you will
                  need money before you reach home!"</p>
               <p>Clarence would have refused this, but Arpiaka would take no refusal, and he was
                  obliged to accede to his wishes.</p>
               <p>Looking, but in vain, to see Ona, although he had the utmost confidence that she
                  would follow him, he at last shook hands with Arpiaka, and with a heavy heart
                  stepped into the canoe, which was to bear him away from the island where he had
                  first known the bliss of love.</p>
               <p>The bliss of love! Ah, to some, who know not change, over whom no cloud hovers,
                  how blissful <emph>is</emph> love! Yet others there are, whose love,
                     <emph>too</emph> strong almost, is like madness. It is such that it is never
                  satisfied, for, while possessing, it ever fears the loss of its treasure. There
                  can be no love, that <emph>is</emph>, love without jealousy and fear, and, alas!
                  no torture is there in hell below, or on earth above, which is so keen, so killing
                  as jealousy. But excuse the digression.</p>
               <p>The warriors chosen by Arpiaka to escort Clarence back to his regiment were such
                  as the latter would have picked, had <emph>he</emph> been permitted his choice.
                  They were honest and trusty braves, and they looked upon him not as a captive, but
                  as a late and honored guest of their great prophet. And they honored him, too, for
                  his courage, that greatest of virtues in an Indian's eyes, for they had seen him
                  when he had struck down the warriors of Coacoochee.</p>
               <p>The retreat of Arpiaka was soon left far behind, and when night came on, they
                  encamped upon an island out in the open glades, <choice>
                     <sic>beyound</sic>
                     <corr>beyond</corr>

                  down by their camp-fire to rest, so as to be ready for the long row of the next
                  day. But Clarence could not sleep; his thoughts, hopes and fears all were with
                  Ona.</p>
               <p>The moon was shining brightly, and he knew that if she escaped she would pass the
                  island before the dawn of day, and he hoped to see and make some sign of
                  encouragement to her.</p>
               <p>We will leave him, thus, upon the watch, and, for a moment, return to her. After
                  Clarence had gone, and his form could no<figure>

                  <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6989-00000042"/> longer be seen, Arpiaka went to the door
                  of her room, which was fastened, and called to her. For some time the only answer
                  which she gave him was her sobs. At last, however, she replied to his entreaties
                  to come forth, and said:</p>
               <p>"Let me grieve! My heart is full, and it will break if I do not weep! Let me, at
                  least, be left alone! I will not be so sad tomorrow!"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps 'tis best; grief so fierce will be the less lasting!" said he, as he
                  turned away.</p>
               <p>Three hours later, a tall and slender form stole away from a back window of the
                  lodge, and, gliding down to the landing, unseen, singled out a small and
                  gracefully modelled canoe, and springing into it, pushed from the bank. For a
                  little time she scarcely touched the paddle to the water, but let the canoe, with
                  gentle impetus, drift down the dark lagoon, for it was night now, and doubly dense
                  in that narrow channel, overhung by the gloomy cypress. But as she gained a little
                  more distance from her father's camp, she plied her paddle with more strength, and
                  glided on more rapidly.</p>

               <p>Clarence, whom we left watching for the passing of her whom he loved so entirely,
                  began to tremble when the night was far advanced and morning dawn was near at
                  hand, for she came not, and he feared that her escape had either been prevented,
                  or that she had been pursued and overtaken. The night was cloudless, and a full
                  moon's light made everything almost as visible as day, therefore she could not
                  pass the island in the channel unobserved.</p>
               <p>"If she comes not, after I have resigned, I will return, and either perish by her
                  side, or Arpiaka shall yield me her hand!" he murmured, as he stood by the
                  water-side at the landing-place.</p>
               <p>But a flush rose quickly to his check, and he almost ceased to breathe, for he
                     <emph>thought</emph> he heard the dip of a paddle in the rippling waters to the
                  west. A few moments more and the thought became a certainty, for he could
                  distinctly hear the sound, though as yet the tall grass concealed the approaching
                  canoe.</p>
               <p>"She comes—thank God, she comes!" he murmured. "She is mine now, and no power on
                  earth shall ever wrest her from me!"</p>
               <p>A moment later, and he could see her tall, graceful form as she stood up in the
                  after-end of the canoe, plying, with easy strength and firmness, the light but
                  springy lance-wood paddle.</p>
               <p>Suddenly she stopped! Did she see him, and intend to speak? No, her eyes were
                  fixed upon something beyond her, and, as she ceased to urge her boat on, the quick
                  ear of Clarence detected the sound of paddles coming from the other direction.</p>
               <p>From her attitude and look, as well as his own misgivings, he felt sure that he
                  saw danger to her ahead, and, without attempting to awaken his escort, who slept
                  at their camp, a hundred yards or more back in the bushes, he stepped into the
                  canoe, and pushed out from the shore, loosening his pistols in his belt as he did
                  so.</p>
               <p>At this moment he saw that Ona was turning her canoe, as if to fly from some
                  pursuer, and, to make her aware of his presence, he called to her in a low tone,
                  yet sufficiently loud for her to hear. She recognized him, and, with a cry of joy,
                  turned the prow of her canoe toward the island. At the same instant, a canoe
                  darted across her course, coming from the cast, and in it were three warriors, one
                  of whom Clarence instantly recognized as <hi rend="i"/>Coacoochee, not only by his
                  person-but by his voice, as he yelled:</p>
               <p>"Ho! ho! the White Dove has come to meet me at last, has she?"</p>
               <p>"Back, you dog, or you shall die!" cried Ona, as the prow of the other canoe
                  struck against her own, and the bright barrel of a pistol was leveled at the
                  chief's head.</p>
               <p>"Shoot him, Ona; show no mercy now," shouted Clarence, who was exerting every
                  nerve to close with the Indians in his canoe.</p>
               <p>The sound of his voice caused Coacoochee to turn toward <emph>him</emph>.</p>
               <p>"Ho! ho! the pale-faced lover here? He shall die!"</p>
               <p>And the chief raised his rifle with an ever<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6989-00000043"
                  /> deadly aim upon Clarence. But the report of Ona's pistol rang loud and clear,
                  and the rifle full from the villain's grasp, for she had sent a bullet through the
                  arm which raised it. The next instant one of Clarence's revolvers was at work, and
                  one of Coacooche's men—the nearest one to Clarence—fell dead in the canoe. The
                  baffled chief with a yell of rage and mortification on, sprung from his canoe into
                  the shallow and ran into the tall grass, and in a moment was lost to view. The
                  other warrior hurried up, and would have gained the same refuge, not Ona, whose
                  "blood was up," served a "retainer" on him from her pistol, which tumbled him over
                  in the water, where he struggled so desperately that, in pity. Clarence sent a
                  bullet through his brain.</p>
               <p>The next instant, the lovers were in each other's arms.</p>
               <p>"Ona! mine—mine forever!" he cried.</p>
               <p>"Thine forever!" she replied.</p>
               <p>Then, as he saw the Indians from the camp hurrying to the shore, having been
                  aroused by the firing, he bade Ona follow him, and paddled back to the
                  landing.</p>
               <p>There he explained the attack upon Ona by Coacoochee, the fate of the latter and
                  his party. The Indians wished at once to pursue and kill Coacoochee; but Clarence,
                  regarding time as all-precious now, for he feared <emph>her</emph> father's
                  pursuit, persuaded them to abandon that idea, and at once to resume their
                  course.</p>
               <p>When the warriors learned that Ona was determined to accompany Clarence back to
                  his people they were sorely puzzled. They know that Arpiaka would never forgive
                  them if he knew that they helped to carry his daughter away—and yet he had bidden
                  them to obey every order of Clarence until he had been safely placed within reach
                  of his people.</p>
               <p>One of them asked Ona: "Will the 'White Dove' leave father and her red brothers
                  and sisters?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, for a little time, but I will return to them." She answered.</p>
               <p>"When?" asked the warrior.</p>
               <p>"After the pale-faced chief has become my husband I love my father, and I love his
                  people, and we'll not be long away from them."</p>
               <p>"Will the 'White Dove' swear by the Great Spirit that she will come back?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, as sure as the Great Spirit hears me, I will return!" said Ona</p>
               <p>With this promise the Indians were satisfied, and instantly prepared to resume
                  their voyage. They wished Ona to leave her canoe enter theirs with Clarence; but
                  she would not, preferring to go on with them in her own, which was so light and
                  well-modeled, that she could very easily keep up with them, or even outstrip their
                  best speed, if she so desired.</p>
               <p>They now moved rapidly on, and had gained several miles before the day broke. They
                  did not land to breakfast, but ate in their boat, and than, with every muscle
                  strained, they pressed forward, hoping, before night reached them, to arrive at
                  their destination. Leaving them thus, we will return to Arpiaka.</p>
               <p>Soon after the sun arose, he called for Ona, for she seldom was absent from the
                  morning meal The servant, who was sent for her, returned and said that her door
                  was fastened upon the inside, and that he could get no reply to his call.</p>
               <p>In an instant, the threat which Ona had made not to live without Clarence, came to
                  his memory, and knowing her strong will and passionate spirit, he feared that she
                  had committed suicide. Hurriedly he went to her room, and, after calling and
                  receiving no answer, he forced in the door. The open window told him in a moment
                  how she had left the room, and a note, left upon her little table, told him the
                  wherefore. It was as follows: <q>
                     <p>"EVER DEAR FATHER:—For the first time in my life I act in disobedience to
                        your wishes. I am too young to die—to die of a broken heart. You have driven
                        that heart's master from me, and I have followed him. Pursuit is useless,
                        for I swear by the memory of my mother, that I will end my life with my own
                        hand if you attempt to tear me from him! If you do not, when he is my
                        husband, and I know that you will welcome mo back. I will return to you, and
                        be ever dutiful, ever fondly, your ONA."</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>A groan of agony burst from his lips, as he read this note.</p>
               <p>"My child, my child!" he moaned. "Alone, alone—all is dark without Ona!"</p>
               <p>He wandered out, and found that her canoe was gone, and then he went to her
                  favorite arbor, and sat down and wept—wept long and bitterly. His tears seemed to
                  relieve him, for, after a time, he became more composed, and returned to his
                  lodge. But a cloud was on his brow, which he could not dispel.</p>
               <p>Who but those who have lost one dearer than life to them, one whose voice and
                  smile was like the music and light of heaven to their souls, can appreciate
                     <emph>his</emph> grief, his <emph>utter</emph> loneliness!</p>
               <p>He would have gone in pursuit, and besought her return; but he knew that she was
                  one who, having her mind once set, could not be turned, and he dared not attempt
                  it. And he knew, too, how truthful she was, and that she would return if she
                  lived, and with that thought he sustained his heart in its desolation, mourning
                  now, when it was too late, that he had not consented to let Clarence remain. He
                  liked the young man—had found him brave, honorable, and of good principle. He did
                  not fear that his daughter would meet with wrong at his hands, but still he
                  grieved for her absence.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XLIII.</head>
               <p>It was noonday, or, perhaps, a little later, when the two canoes, containing
                  Clarence, Ona, and their party, arrived opposite the once-lovely and fruitful
                  island upon which Clarence had been first taken prisoner, the former home of
                  Arpiaka and his braves. Here they stopped and landed for a short time. Ona's dark
                  eyes were tearful when she saw how desolate and blackened all was now which had
                  been so full of fruitful beauty when she left the spot, and the faces of the
                  warriors were gloomy; but they remembered how Chikika had punished the second
                  invaders, and of Indian Key, and were silent. They had lost fruit-trees, and corn,
                  and houses; but the one could grow, and the other be built again. But the
                  pale-faces had lost many <emph>lives,</emph> which could never be restored
                  again!</p>
               <p>After eating dinner, the party were ready to proceed again, but, before leaving,
                  one of the Indians ascended the lofty tree which had before been used as a
                  look-out, for, from amid its thick-leaved branches, the sentinel placed there
                  could command a most extended view, reaching with the vision as far as the main
                  land, and quite overlooking the small island, some three or four miles distant,
                  which we have noticed before.</p>
               <p>He had hardly reached the first limb, when a cry of alarm broke from his lips. He
                  had detected the pale-faced sentinels in the tree tops upon the small island—the
                  soldiers who had been placed there by the commander of the third expedition of <choice>
                     <sic>invsion</sic>
                     <corr>invasion</corr>
                  </choice>, for they had not the Indian cunning to conceal themselves from an
                  experienced eye, like that of the warrior. He instantly communicated the discovery
                  to his companions, one of whom soon joined him. They could from their position see
                  the camp of the soldiers and their boats, for the island on which they were, as
                  well as the tree in which they stood, was much higher than the other. Their little
                  party, coming from the west through a narrow channel, had evidently not been seen
                  by the look-outs, for no stir was visible on the smaller island to indicate
                  it.</p>
               <p>The Indians having reported to Clarence, a consultation was held, and with the
                  consent, in fact by the strenuous advice of the latter, the warriors silently and
                  stealthily decamped in their canoe, taking the back track, so as to warn Chikika
                  and Arpiaka of this expedition, and to themselves avoid danger. Clarence told them
                  that to ensure their safety he and Ona would remain concealed until near night,
                  and then would go on and meet the whites whom they would endeavor to persuade to
                  return, and not succeeding in that, would at any rate so misdirect them as to put
                  them off the course which endangered their red friends.</p>
               <p>Ona gave them a message to her father, which would exonerate them from all blame,
                  and Clarence gave them a liberal amount of gold from his purse.</p>
               <p>And then they went off silently, and Ona and Clarence felt that they were alone,
                  and to each other all in all. What to them was the world, its good or its evil,
                  its riches or its poverty, its self-righteousness, or its misery. They knew not,
                  cared not for any world but their own, peopled, enriched, beautified, lighted by
                  their love! Oh, such a world is heaven, <emph>more</emph> than heaven!</p>
               <p>Time was not counted while they spoke of the past, and pictured out their future,
                  and soon the low-sinking sun told them that it was time to move so as to reach the
                  other island before it set.</p>
               <p>Clarence had ascended the tree, and with a small field telescope satisfied himself
                  that the party was composed of soldiers of his own regiment; therefore he felt no
                  fear in advancing; but though he was in his uniform, which still showed the rents
                  made when he received the numerous wounds, he determined, for Ona's safety, to
                  hoist a handkerchief as a white flag in the bow of his canoe, for she was in the
                  picturesque costume of an Indian girl, and her appearance might, without proper
                  precaution, draw fire upon her.</p>
               <p>With her in the stern and himself in the bow of the canoe, he at last pushed off,
                  and they paddled swiftly toward the camp of the soldiers. They knew in a short
                  time that they were watched, but no signs of a movement upon the island being
                  seen, Clarence halted just outside of gun shot from it and fired a gun to attract
                  attention. He then stood up in the canoe and waved his flag, being determined to
                  avoid every risk of being shot by his own friends.</p>
               <p>After a short delay, three armed boats put off from the island, and approached
                  cautiously, for an ambuscade was feared, until an officer in the leading boat,
                  Captain Fulton, recognized Clarence.</p>
               <p>Then he dashed on rapidly, and in a moment had him by the hand.</p>
               <p>"Heavens, <emph>Febiger!</emph> Is this you, <emph>really</emph> you, or your
                  ghost?"</p>
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6989-00000044"/>
               <p>"Me, or all that is left of me, for I've been cut up and thinned down considerably
                  since I left the regiment!" replied Clarence.</p>
               <p>"Why, we thought you surely had been killed, air; I have your commission now with
                  me, which I was going to send home to your mother, with an account of your
                  supposed fate. And this—this squaw with you, does she speak English? She looks
                  very light for an Indian!"</p>
               <p>Clarence laughed outright, and Ona smiled.</p>
               <p>"Permit me, Captain Fulton," said the former, "to introduce to you, Miss
                  Livingston, formerly of New York, but late of Magnolia Place, Florida, who will
                  soon be my bride!"</p>
               <p>Fulton blushed deeply, and said: "Excuse me, lady—we soldiers become very rough
                  here in the wilderness and swamps. Your costume misled me!"</p>
               <p>"It requires no excuse from the lips of a friend to my Clarence!" said the
                  beautiful girl. "When I am beyond the wilderness, I will resume the dress which is
                  worn by ladies of my race!"</p>
               <p>"And well will it become you, lady. Excuse the bluntness of an old soldier, but
                  never have I seen in our halls of beauty one to compare with you. My lieutenant is
                  a fortunate man!"</p>
               <p>Ona bowed and blushed, for she was all unused to compliments; yet she need not,
                  for the captain was too sincere and honest to think of flattery.</p>
               <p>"But we must hurry back—the colonel is in one of his devilish humors to-day—killed
                  a poor devil of an Indian, after torturing him almost to death to try and make him
                  betray the hiding-place of his people. We are all heartily sick of him and his
                  brutality. We must return, and then you must tell me how you escaped and all about
                  it!"</p>
               <p>And the captain gave orders to turn the boats toward the island, leading the way
                  himself, close followed by Clarence and Ona.</p>

               <p>It was almost impossible, in spite of the strong orders for silence, to prevent
                  the officers and soldiers from cheering, when it was found that their favorite
                  lieutenant, Clarence Febiger, had arrived safely in camp. The commanding officer
                  at once sent for him, and, accompanied by Ona, he at once confronted that
                  important individual.</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, so you're back! A pretty cursed mess you made out of your scout—lost

                  welcome which he received.</p>
               <p>To these words, so rude and ungentlemanly, Clarence made no reply.</p>

                         from it! Some officers yet live, who remember the fate of a beautiful young
                         daughter of Chikika, while she was a prisoner in his hands, and other
                         corroborative matters, which I cannot new refer to.</p>

               <p>"This <emph>lady</emph> is under my protection, and as such, shall be defended
                  from insult, sir!" said Clarence, flushing up with anger.</p>
               <p>"Lady—she <emph>looks</emph> very like a lady, in her blanket and leggins, and
                  short petticoat! You've very good taste, but as all squaws, whether they come in
                  or are taken, are to be detained as prisoners, until they can be sent west, I'll
                  relieve you of <emph>your</emph> charge of the prisoner!"</p>
               <p>"Sir!" cried Clarence, in a tone of thunder, "this lady is as white in face as any
                  of your blood, and ten times as pure! She will soon be my wife! Dare but breathe
                  another insulting word, and I will make you answer for it at the sword's
                  point!"</p>
               <p>"God, sir! what do you mean? How dare you insult your <emph>superior</emph>
                  officer? I'll have you court-martialed, sir, shot, sir—blast you, shot!"</p>
               <p>"You are my superior in rank no more, sir, for from this moment I am free from the
                  disgrace of serving under a brutal blackguard. I resign my commission, sir!" and
                  the young officer threw the commission which Fulton had returned to him, at the
                  feet of the colonel.</p>
               <p>"By thunder, sir, you shall <emph>not</emph> resign!"</p>
               <p>"You cannot prevent it, sir. I am now a private citizen, and shall at once
                  acquaint the Secretary of War with the facts, and my reasons for it!"</p>
               <p>"If you get the chance, curse you, if you get the chance! I suppose that you've
                  just come from some camp where you have been treated like a lord!"</p>
               <p>"I have come from those who have cured my wounds, and shown humanity which would
                  shame some of those who hunt them!" replied Clarence, firmly.</p>
               <p>"Meaning <emph>me,</emph> I suppose!"</p>
               <p>"Meaning <emph>you,</emph> sir!" was the response.</p>
               <p>"More foundation for charges, gentlemen. I call upon you all to remember his
                  words!" cried the enraged commander to his officers, who, with one or two "toady"
                  exceptions, were as much disgusted with him as Clarence was</p>
               <p>"I suppose," continued the commander, "that if I let you keep your squaw, you'll
                  not object to guiding us to the Indian camp which you've lately come from?"</p>
               <p>"Betray those who spared my life, treated me with every humanity, and when I was
                  cured of my wounds, so as to be able to travel, set me, unconditionally, free? The
                  proposition is as base as the heart which prompted it. Never, never will I so sink
                  my manhood!"</p>
               <p>"You hear his mutinous words, gentlemen. Treason, rank treason! I would be
                  justified in shooting him down on the spot!"</p>
               <p>"You would find it a dangerous experiment," said Clarence, with a calm smile.</p>
               <p>"<emph>What,</emph> THREATS, sir! I arrest you! Seize and bind the mutineer, and
                  tie up that squaw, too. Put both under guard, but keep them separate!"</p>
               <p>The hand of Clarence was on his pistol, and Ona, whose flashing eyes spoke her
                  scorn and indignation too, grasped her weapons, ready to die by his side bravely,
                  if need came.</p>
               <p>But neither officer or man stirred to execute the brutal order.</p>
               <p>"Captain Fulton!" thundered the tyrant—"Captain Fulton, did you hear me, sir?"</p>
               <p>"I did, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Why, then, do you not obey my orders, sir?"</p>
               <p>"I do not consider that I have any right to lay my hands on a private citizen,
                  sir!"</p>
               <p>"A private citizen—h-II! Consider yourself under arrest, sir! I'll see if I am to
                  be held in contempt for nothing—consider yourself under arrest, sir! Deliver your
                  sword to Lieutenant Inge!"</p>
               <p>"Lieutenant Inge <ref rend="super" target="#note_013" xml:id="return_013">†</ref>
                   will never take the sword of his captain, under such circumstances!" said
                   the last named officer.</p><note place="foot" xml:id="note_013">

                   </note>
               <p>"Then, by thunder, sir, I arrest you! I'll arrest every mother's son of you, and
                  appoint officers from the ranks!" he shouted.</p>
               <p>"And the divil a one wud serve! Ye'd betther arrist the rigiment!" said a voice
                  from among the men who had clustered around the group of officers, and were
                  listening to all that passed.</p>
               <p>"Who spoke then?" asked the colonel, fairly boiling over with rage.</p>
               <p>"Biddy O'Grallagan!" said some one, and then a titter ran through the crowd.</p>
               <p>"By Heavens, this mutiny shall be the death of some you. Lieutenant Snip, take
                  that woman to my quarters, and have Febiger tied up and put under guard!" cried
                  the commander to one of his toadies.</p>
               <p>Clarence, who knew Ona well, and what she would be apt to do, said nothing, as the
                     <emph>sub</emph> approached her, with the intention of putting the order into
                  execution, so far as <emph>she</emph> was concerned, for he had been a tailor, and
                  wasn't afraid of a woman.</p>
               <p>He got within about two yards of her, when he very suddenly halted, and, turning
                  as white as his pipe-clayed belt, he stammered, with a trembling voice, "Don't
                  shoot—don't shoot, for the Lord's sake!"</p>
               <p>For Ona stood with one foot advanced, and a long barreled pistol in her hand,
                  aimed directly at his eye—her finger on the trigger, and a look in her face so
                  calm, that he knew that death was his doom, if he advanced but one step.</p>
               <p>"You cursed coward, I'll take her myself!" cried the colonel, springing forward;
                  but he stopped, too, when the pistol barrel was as quietly and steadily turned to
                     <emph>his</emph> eye.</p>
               <p>"Why <emph>don't</emph> you take her, sir?" said Clarence, bitterly. "So
                     <emph>brave</emph> an officer ought not to fear a woman!"</p>
               <p>"By the eternal! she shall die!" shouted the infuriated man—"she shall die!" and
                  he half drew his sword.</p>
               <p>"Shame, shame!" cried officers and men.</p>
               <p>"Let him go on, gentlemen!" said Ona, whose voice of melody now fell upon their
                  ears for the first time. "When he has drawn that weapon, and advanced one step
                  toward me, he will have taken his last step in life, and I will be justified in
                  sending him <emph>down</emph> to meet his master!"</p>
               <p>A cheer broke from the lips of the rude soldiers, when they saw how bravely too
                  heroine held herself.</p>
               <p>"We will break up this camp, and return to the fort at once!" said the colonel,
                  whose rage was only equaled by his mortification, and he turned away to his
                  tent.</p>
               <p>"As I am free, I will proceed at once! Come Ona!" said Clarence, turning to his
                  canoe.</p>
               <p>"I am under arrest, and not required with my company; permit me to go along and
                  help paddle your canoe!" said Fulton.</p>
               <p>"Certainly, captain, certainly!" said Clarence, and soon the three were on their
                  way to the Miama.</p>
               <p>"By the gods of war, Miss Livingston, you cooled the colonel down in a hurry!"
                  said the captain, after he had paddled some time. "Clarence will never have
                  occasion to fight <emph>your</emph> battles!"</p>
               <p>"Nor any other, I hope, hereafter, sir! His resignation brings joy to my heart,
                  for I shall have him all to myself!"</p>
               <p>"But his comrades will regret it, lady! He was the life of the regiment!"</p>
               <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6989-00000045"/>
               <p>"My only wonder is, that all of them who are <emph>men</emph>, do not follow his
                  example, rather than to serve under a brutal tyrant, said Ona. "I thought none but
                     <emph>gentlemen</emph> held commissions in the army. How could such a man as
                     <emph>be</emph> get his high position?"</p>
               <p>"By political influence, lady! Made right from the cotton-field—a nigger-driver
                  there, and not much better here! Our graduates from the military academy are
                  gentlemen, so are many of the citizen appointments, but such men as he will
                  sometimes get in!"</p>
               <p>They soon entered the little river, and went rapidly down its swift current, and,
                  long before midnight, were at the fort. Observing that one of the transport
                  steamboats, used to bring stores, etc., from more northern ports, was at anchor
                  off the mouth of the river, Clarence determined to go on board at once, for he did
                  not wish to give the brutal tyrant another opportunity to insult either Ona or
                  himself.</p>
               <p>This he did, and was warmly welcomed by the captain, whom he knew, and whose wife
                  being on board, could render many attentions to Ona, which she required, and also
                  furnish her with different clothes, which would not attract so much attention.</p>
               <p>"When do you leave, Captain Duke?" asked Clarence, after he had explained his
                  position, and his recent adventures.</p>
               <p>"For Savannah, to-morrow, just as soon as the quarter-master has put some wood
                  aboard for me, and signed all the receipts!" said the captain.</p>
               <p>"I shall go with you—I and my sweet wife that is to be!" said he.</p>
               <p>"I'm glad of that. If you feel in a hurry to get married, I'll run into St.
                  Augustine, and find a priest for you!"</p>
               <p>"Thank you, my dear Duke, thank you! I do not feel so anxious, now that my
                  bride-elect is in safe quarters!" said Clarence, smiling at the kind-hearted
                  proposition, and resigning Ona to the care of Mrs. Duke, for the exhausted girl
                  much needed rest.</p>
               <p>"You <emph>must</emph> come to my <emph>private</emph> state-room, and take a
                  toddy with me, in honor of the occasion!" said the captain. "Fulton has gone
                  ashore, for he expects a breeze when old Brick-top gets down the river. The old
                  heathen had better not put on any of his hifalutin' airs aboard <emph>this</emph>
                  boat, or he'll go overboard as sure as my name is Jim Duke!"</p>
               <p>Clarence could not well refuse the invitation—therefore, he followed the
                  warm-hearted captain to his "<emph>private</emph> state-room," as he called it,
                  which was almost entirely filled with jugs, bottles, demijohns, small kegs, and
                  cigar-boxes—and there they both "<emph>smiled</emph>."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XLV.</head>
               <p>Moving much more slowly than Clarence, with the light canoe, and also taking
                     <unclear>some time</unclear> to break up camp, for the discontented men worked
                  sullenly and lazily, it was nearly dawn when the colonel reached the fort with his
                  forces.</p>
               <p>His first inquiry upon landing was for Clarence and Ona, for while his bad heart
                  burned with fury against the first, the beauty of the last had added a more
                  fiendish passion than rage to his nature.</p>
               <p>He instantly ordered an officer of the garrison to go on board and bring them
                  ashore. The officer soon returned, and of course without having accomplished the
                  object of his mission.</p>
               <p>"Why the deuce didn't you bring them ashore, dead or alive, sir!" cried the
                  colonel, who had got rum enough in him to make him more brutal than ever.</p>
               <p>"He has resigned from the service, sir, and I dare not risk my commission by
                  placing my hand upon a private citizen!" replied the officer.</p>
               <p>"But the squaw—the squaw!" cried the colonel, showing his "full hand;" "she is a
                  prisoner, and by Heaven shall remain so!"</p>
               <p>"If you mean the lady who is with him, you are mistaken, sir! She is a
                     <emph>lady,</emph> as fair and well-bred as the first in the land!"</p>
               <p>"You lie—curse you, you lie!"</p>
               <p>"Your rank shields you alone from punishment, sir, and your conduct would disgrace
                  a brothel!" said the officer, retiring in disgust from his presence.</p>
               <p>"By the eternal, I'll go myself!" he cried. "Orderly! send Lieutenant Snip
                  here!"</p>
               <p>The orderly obeyed, and soon the ex-tailor made his appearance. He looked a very
                  good "<emph>pattern</emph>" of the ninth part of a man, and any one would wonder
                  how he could have got into the service, who did not understand how
                     <emph>some</emph> officials pay their tailor bills in Washington. The son of a
                  tailor, dressmaker, bootmaker, hatter, or milliner, can always find influence for
                  an office, or commission, which the worthy descendant of a revolutionary hero
                  would ask for in vain. There is at this moment a wealthy wine-merchant, in one of
                  our large seaboard cities, whose boast is, that his son's commission only cost him
                  a half-a-dozen baskets of champagne, <hi rend="i"/>Jersey-made at that.</p>
               <p>"Lieutenant Snip, go and select ten men, whom you know you can depend upon to obey
                  orders, and prepare to go on board of that steamer, to make an arrest. And, curse
                  you, don't you show the white feather again, as you did last night, or I'll run
                  you through quicker than I did the Indian! Do you hear?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," stammered Snip; "but—but—"</p>
               <p>"But <emph>what,</emph> sir?"</p>
               <p>"Are you going to try to arrest Febiger and his woman?"</p>
               <p>"Not to <emph>try,</emph> but to <emph>do</emph> it—curse you, to DO it! Now, do
                  you understand me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir—but hadn't I better order out a whole company, instead of ten men, sir?
                  Febiger is dreadful desperate, and I'd rather face the devil than that woman l.
                  She'd kill a fellow before he could take a stitch in a button-hole!"</p>
               <p>"Curse you for a sneaking tailor—I can never make a man of you! Go and obey my
                  orders; muster ten men, and bring them here, or I'll break your thick head!"</p>
               <p>Thus admonished, Snip disappeared, and the tyrant began to prepare himself to
                  carry out his manly intentions, by taking a stiffener of whiskey—his favorite
                  beverage.</p>
               <p>The orderly, who had heard all of this conversation, now whispered to another
                  soldier, who, like himself, was friendly to Clarence, to go and inform Captain
                  Fulton of the plans of the tyrannical wretch. The latter at once went on board of
                  the steamer, where he found Captain Duke and Clarence, both afoot, early as it
                  was.</p>
               <p>He at once stated the object of his visit.</p>
               <p>"Old Brick-top coming here to try to take away <emph>my</emph> passengers?" cried
                  Captain Duke, who at <emph>all</emph> times was excitable, as most warm-hearted
                  men are, but doubly so now. "By the big pewter spoon that Goliah eat mush and milk
                  with, he'll find his match! Here, you Pluto, you angel of darkness, come
                  here!"</p>
               <p>The black cook answered this summons, and as he stood there, showing his ivories,
                  he asked what "massa cap'n" wanted?</p>
               <p>"Have you got hot water in the coppers?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sah!"</p>
               <p>"Well, stir up the fire, and keep it hot, and when you hear me whistle, bring me
                  two buckets of it, and make Pomp and Sam bring four more, and when and where I
                  tell you to heave it, <emph>heave!</emph> Do you understand?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sah!" said the darkie, who was used to his master's odd ways, and knew how
                  to obey orders without asking questions.</p>
               <p>"And tell the mate I want him!" said the captain.</p>
               <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6989-00000046"/>
               <p>The mate was near by, and at once responded to the inquiry for him, in person.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Smith, just trice up the accommodation ladders on both sides of the vessel,
                  so that anybody who comes aboard of here, without my consent, will have some
                  climbing to do!"</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye, sir!" responded the officer.</p>
               <p>"And let me know, Mr. Smith, the moment that you see a boat coming from shore, and
                  see if old Brick-top, Colonel—, is in it!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir!"</p>
               <p>"You must not get yourself into trouble on my account, my dear Duke!" said
                  Clarence. "I can very easily defend myself, for I am well armed!"</p>
               <p>"Just you be easy, <emph>if</emph> you <emph>please</emph>, Mr. Febiger!" replied
                  the captain, blandly. "What I do here is on my own account. The 'right of visit'
                  and 'the right of search' are two things which no bloody soldier (present company
                  always excepted, gentlemen), like old Brick-top, shall ever make me acknowledge!
                  If he gets himself into hot water, it will be because he sticks his nose where he
                  has no business to put it. But come, gentlemen, my throat tickles. I've got an
                  anti-fog-matic beverage down in my private state-room, which has been commended by
                  all of the doctors, and two-thirds of the preachers in the land, as being 'good
                  for the stomach!' Let's try some of it!"</p>
               <p>The captain, under the circumstances, could not expected of a refusal, nor did he
                  receive it.</p>
               <p>"There is a boat coming from shore, sir!" reported the mate, at the moment when
                  they had their glasses to their lips.</p>
               <p>"Verry well. Mr. Smith! Take a nip, sir! Are the ladders triced up?"</p>
               <p>"Yes sir!"</p>
               <p>"And Brick-top in the boat?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, with an officer and a dozen soldiers, all armed!"</p>
               <p>"Very well. Tell the cook and his niggers to have their hot water ready. Let the
                  rest of the men be hunting up handspikes and cordwood knots about decks. You
                  understand me, don't you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, <emph>sir!</emph>" said the mate, tossing off his grog, and then hastening
                  to obey orders.</p>
               <p>Captains Duke and Fulton and Clarence now look their bitters and then went on deck
                  to see what was next on the programme.</p>
               <p>The boat from shore was nearly alongside. The colonel, whose face was red as fire,
                  excited alike with rum and anger, shouted as she came near:</p>
               <p>"What have you got your ladders pulled up for, you infernal curse!"</p>
               <p>"You trick-topped old heathen you, if you curse <emph>me</emph>. I'll give you
                  something to remember till the devil gets you!" shouted Duke.</p>
               <p>"Lower down your ladder, so that I can come aboard!"</p>
               <p>"I'll see you entirely, particularly, and essentially cursed first!" replied
                  Duke.</p>
               <p>"Climb up there, one of you, and lower down the ladder!" shouted the colonel, as
                  his boat's bow touched the steamer's side.</p>
               <p>"Stand by with the water, Pluto!" said Duke, in a low tone.</p>
               <p>"Yes, massa cap'n, him all ready!" said the negro, with a broad grin</p>
               <p>A moment later, as the head and shoulders of a soldier appeared over the steamer's
                  rail Duke pointed toward it and said, "<emph>heave!</emph>"</p>
               <p>With a yell of agony the soldier let go all holds, and dropped back into the
                  boat.</p>
               <p>"Give them all a dose—old Brick-top as well as the rest!" shouted Duke, and in a
                  second the whole boat's crew found themselves literally in "hot water," and,
                  yelling and screaming, they pushed clear of the steamer,</p>
               <p>"I'll sink your cursed boat!" yelled the colonel, kicking poor Snip to make him
                  stop howling.</p>
               <p>"Try it!" cried Duke. "I've got guns as well as hot water! And tell your
                  quarter-master if he isn't alongside soon with my receipts, I'll go off without
                  them, and report him and you to the department! I'm not going to lose my steamer's
                  time, waiting for a parcel of rum-swilling, squaw-hunting soldiers like
                  yourself!"</p>
               <p>"I suppose you'll lower your ladder for the quarter-master?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but if you offer to come with him, I'll give you more hot water, you blasted
                  heathen!"</p>
               <p>The discomfited colonel now returned to the shore to have his scalds dressed, and
                  he did not find it convenient to return when the quarter-master came off.</p>
               <p>And though many boats came from shore, bringing officers who wished to bid
                  Clarence adieu and wish him happiness with his bride, there was no further
                  occasion to use <emph>hot</emph> water, It had worked a miracle, for it had
                  effectually <emph>cooled</emph> the ardor of the tyrant, and rendered him sensible
                  to the soothing influences of sweet oil and laudanum.</p>
               <p>Clarence made a confidant of Captain Fulton, so far as to let him know who the
                  father of Ona was, that in case he should be taken he might find a friend in
                     <emph>him</emph>, but he did not reveal any clue by which his retreat could be
                  discovered.</p>
               <p>The sun had not quite reached its meridian when Captain Duke was ready for sea,
                  fired up and off. Rapidly the steamer swept down the smooth bay, and, taking the
                  high tide, steered ont through the narrow channel of "Bear Cut," to the north of
                  Key Biscayne, and was soon heading away to the north-eastward, with wind and
                  current both in her favor. And now, out upon the glorious ocean, far from the
                  reach of those who had so lately imperilled their peace, Ona felt indeed that
                  Clarence was all her own, and that, henceforth, all would be sunshine to her. She
                  thought but little of her <choice>

                  </choice> grief and loneliness—she was too happy to think!</p>
               <p>Ah, how selfish is love! And why should it not be? I only ask a reply from
                     <emph>those</emph> who love! Let old bachelors and ancient maidens hold their

               <head>CHAPTER XLVI.</head>
               <p>How suddenly in life are the brightest prospects clouded. Truly, when we speak of
                  fate and fortune, we may say that they are fickle, more fickle than the changing
                  wind. We are told by wise and holy men that the decrees of Providence are
                  immutable. Perhaps they are so. But, without any disrespect, permit me to say that
                  I think they are shrouded in a very unnecessary amount of mystery. Why can't a
                  fellow know what is coming, see the grand <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                  >finale</foreign>, and shape his ends to meet it decently, with his clothes on and
                  buttoned up.</p>
               <p>When Captain Duke's steamer left the Bay of Biscayne, and edged up on her course
                  in the blue Gulf Stream, all was fair overhead, scarce a cloud in sight, and not a
                  sign of an approaching gale. The sea rolled smoothly on, and the steamer, under a
                  full head, clove the blue waters asunder, and swept rapidly northward. Her sails
                  were spread to the favoring breeze, in addition to her steam, and each mile that
                  she made, increasing the distance between Clarence and his foes, lightened the
                  heart of Ona, although they also increased the distance which separated her from
                  her father, whom she loved ever tenderly.</p>
               <p>Yet loved she more than all on earth or in heaven, him upon whose arm she leaned,
                  as they paced to and fro upon the steamer's promenade deck, now glancing off over
                  the far blue waters of the Gulf Stream upon many a snowy sail, which, like a
                  white-winged bird, glided over it, then looking shoreward upon the fadeless green
                  and rich hued foliage of that tropic clime.</p>
               <p>The houses of the military posts, known as Fort Sanderdale, were soon passed; then
                  came in sight the bluff known as the Black Rocks, and Captain Duke ordered the
                  engineers to press her, so that she should double Caernaveral's ugly cape before
                  night with its darkness set in.</p>
               <p>Clarence noticed with some apprehension that the captain very often went into the
                  cabin and looked at his barometer; but he carefully concealed his fears, if he had
                  any, from Ona, and, finally, with some well devised excuse, got her down into the
                  cabin, and placed a book in her hand which he knew would interest her, for she had
                  passed her happiest hours in such companionship while in the camp of her father.
                  Having done this, Clarence sought the captain, who, seeing that he was disengaged,
                  solicited his company to a <emph>spiritual</emph> consultation in his private
                  state-room</p>
               <p>"Why do you look at your barometer, today, so often, captain?" asked Clarence,
                  with assumed carelessness, while he "qualified" a whiskey toddy with some
                  water.</p>
               <p>"Oh, it's a habit I have!" said the captain, "I always keep my eyes open in these
                  latitudes, especially at this season, when a blow springs up all of a sudden, and
                  no one can tell how long it will last."</p>
               <p>"But, Duke, my dear fellow, you know I'm no coward—we've sailed together before;
                  you know that the weather, though fair now, looks like a change."</p>
               <p>"Well, lieutenant, seeing that it is you, I don't know as I need to hide it. The
                  barometer <emph>has</emph> been falling ever since morning, and I am now crowding
                  all the steam and sail I can, in hopes of being able to get into Indian River, if
                  I can, before a blow comes on. The 'old boat' was never built for outside work on
                  the ocean, and though she is staunch for her age, build, and tonnage, I've no wish
                  to test her capacity in a gale in the gulf."</p>
               <p>"Nor I to see you do it," said Clarence, while a shade of anxiety crossed his
                  face. "Is there anything which I can do to aid you. Captain Duke?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, sir, only keep that lady-bird or your's easy in her mind, and don't let
                  any one aboard see you look anxious. I never let my men feel through my looks that
                  there is danger, no matter what there is before me."</p>
               <p>"You can rely on me—I will be as cool as yourself, captain, and to be more so is
                  impossible!" replied Clarence, and he again sought the side of his lady-love, and
                  entered into cheerful conversation with her.</p>
               <p>Meantime, the change indicated by the barometer so long before, began to be
                  visible to the eye. The fresh westerly breeze died away, and the sails flapped so
                  idly against the spars,<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6989-00000047"/> that the officer
                  of the deck had them taken in. And the air grew still, and hot, and stilling. And
                  a heavy circlet of cloud seemed to be slowly rising from the horizon all around.
                  That a gale was coming, all could see, but from what direction no one could
                  say.</p>
               <p>"Crowd on the steam, crowd on the steam!" cried Captain Duke to the engineer, who
                  looked up from the engine room to cool his burning face.</p>
               <p>"God, sir, she will not bear another ounce, nor can fire make it for her!" replied
                  the officer.</p>
               <p>"Thank God! the bluff of St. Lucid looms up in sight at last!" said he. "Give us
                  only three hours more of calm, and it may blow all creation up by the roots, for
                  all that I care. I'll be at snug moorings then."</p>
               <p>As he spoke, a low but distant rumbling rolled across the water. It was the sound
                  of the thunder-ear of the spirit of the storm. And now more rapidly did the
                  cloud-belt rise, which so darkly circled them. The captain calmly ordered all the
                  light spars sent down, the boats to be secured with extra fastenings, and
                  everything loose on deck and below to be made fast. And he bade the engineer keep
                  up the steam and look well to his machinery. This done, he calmly stood by the
                  helmsman, and waited for the gale.</p>
               <p>And near him steed Clarence and Ona, for she had heard the rapid orders, and
                  intuitively knew that danger was apprehended. But she did not tremble nor pale,
                  though she clung closely to the arm of Clarence, for her eyes were on his face,
                  not upon the sky, and that face was as quiet and calm as if he was sleeping.</p>
               <p>Everything was very still now, except the clang of the engine and the dash of the
                  paddles in the water. The crew were silent; there was no wind, even the distant
                  thunder ceased to roll, while the clouds gathered thick and dark overhead, until
                  the scene wore almost the gloom of night. In the west, the white outlines of a
                  sandy beach, with tall pines for a background, could be seen—all else around was
                  sombre water.</p>
               <p>Suddenly, a gleam of lightning shot athwart the whole sky, seeming to tear the
                  huge density of cloud into a thousand ragged fragments. And close upon it followed
                  a <choice>
                     <sic>terriffic</sic>
                     <corr>terrific</corr>
                  </choice> peal of thunder, as if an hundred batteries of cannon had all at once
                  belched forth their tremendous fire. Then from the rent clouds came vast torrents
                  of rain, so dense, so heavy, that the crew sought refuge below, except those on
                  immediate duty, and Ona was glad, with Clarence to seek shelter in the roomy
                  wheel-house by the side of the captain. Never had she seen rain pour in that way
                  before.</p>
               <p>Meantime, the steamer held her course, steadily plunging through the black and
                  seething waters, as if endued with life; and the brave captain, with his favorite
                  steersman by his side, watched the compass, and prayed that no worse than rain
                  would come.</p>
               <p>"Are we not near the port?" asked Clarence, at last.</p>
               <p>"Only an hour's or two hours' run from it, at the furthest, if it holds calm!"
                  replied the captain.</p>
               <p>Just as he spoke, a tremendous concussion was heard amongst the machinery below,
                  and the next moment the wheels of the steamer stopped.</p>
               <p>"Good God, what is the matter now?" asked Clarence.</p>
               <p>The engineer rushed on deck at that instant, and reported to Captain Duke that the
                  main shaft was broken short off.</p>
               <p>"Damnation!" was the only response of Duke, as he hurried below to look at the
                  damage. He soon returned, and, though he assumed a forced calmness, he could not
                  conceal that he was annoyed and troubled.</p>
               <p>"Well, what's the damage?" asked Clarence, who had persuaded Ona to go into the
                  cabin, promising to call her if the danger increased.</p>
               <p>"If we had a fair wind, and not too much of it, I wouldn't care?" said Duke. "We
                  have got to depend upon our canvas now, for we cannot get the shaft repaired on
                  this side of Savannah."</p>
               <p>While he was speaking, the rain ceased almost as suddenly as it had come on, and
                  the darkness began to clear away.</p>
               <p>"I think a breeze will soon spring up!" said Clarence.</p>
               <p>"More than a breeze—an infernal gale, I expect!" muttered Duke. And then he gave
                  orders to reef the fore-and-aft sails of the steamer, and to double the sheets,
                  and get up additional stays for the masts and chimneys. Having seen this done, and
                  knowing that he could do no more, but must in patience await the issue, whatever
                  it might be, the captain invited Clarence to visit his "private stateroom" once
                  more, "for," said he, "it is likely that I shall be too busy for such matters in a
                  little while, and a drop or two won't hurt me just now, it isn't likely."</p>
               <p>Clarence silently complied with his request, for he had not the heart to refuse
                  him, so sorrowful did he seem in his trouble.</p>
               <p>They soon returned to the deck. Night was now approaching, and they were slowly
                  drifting in toward the beach. Captain Duke now ordered the anchors cleared, and
                  the cables ranged, and then, the thought striking him that help might be sent out
                  from Indian River, if his signals of distress were heard at the fort there, he
                  caused his pilot gun to be fired several times.</p>
               <p>"What sound is that?" asked Clarence, as a low and sullen roar came up from the
                  southeastward, sounding like the distant clamor of an angry multitude of men.</p>
               <p>"It is that which I most dreaded, a gale, and blowing right on shore!" said
                  Captain Duke, uneasily, as he glanced to windward. "If this were a staunch
                  clipper, stout sparred, and with a good hold below water, and but little above it,
                  we might claw off, but, as it is, with our heavy upper works, and scanty sail, we
                  cannot. I fear that I shall have to beach her."</p>
               <p>"There would not be much risk in that, while the sea is smooth!" said Clarence.
                  "We could reach the land safely, over the bows of the boat!"</p>
               <p>"But the <emph>safety</emph> after we get there would be the question!" said Duke,
                  earnestly. "The coast swarms with Indians, who watch for every wreck, and pounce
                  on their helpless crews!"</p>
               <p>"But your crew numbers twenty men or more, good and true, and we have plenty of
                  arms and ammunition!"</p>
               <p>"What will twenty men be against a hundred or two savages, who have the advantage
                  of a knowledge of the country?"</p>
               <p>"They <emph>must</emph> be all <emph>in</emph> all to us! I have something
                     <emph>more</emph> than life to fight for!" sighed Clarence, as he thought of
                  poor Ona.</p>
               <p>The sound of the rising gale came now, louder and louder, on their cars, and the
                  watchful captain trimmed his scanty sails so as best to meet it. A little longer
                  only had they to wait, and then it came with fearful force. At first, the steamer
                  careened so that she appeared to be capsizing, and Clarence hastened to the side
                  of Ona, to relieve her of fear, and to aid her when it became necessary.</p>
               <p>The captain saw at once, that the only way to save his crew would be to beach the
                  vessel before the sea became too rough for the crew to land, and, with a heavy
                  heart, he gave the order to hoist a sail forward, and to put the helm up so as to
                  run in. For no captain looks upon the approaching loss of his vessel but with
                  grief.</p>
               <p>Orders were given to the crew to get out provisions, etc., and to arm themselves
                  well, and prepare plenty of ammunition. Some tents, and other necessary articles,
                  were ordered up, and then all was ready.</p>
               <p>Clarence and Ona stood on deck, ready, like the rest, to meet the shock when the
                  vessel should strike the shore. She now moved swiftly on before the howling
                  gale—the white beach and its crumbling breakers were close on board, and in a
                  short time, just as the sun was going down in the west, the ill-fated vessel
                  struck. By her own force, and the swift-following surges, she was fenced high up
                  on the beach, and it was an easy thing to land from over her bows, and to take on
                  shore the articles which had been selected. But they were obliged to hasten in
                  this, for the storm rose with fearful rapidity and strength, and they soon heard
                  the heavy seas crashing in the bulwarks and strong timbers of the boat.</p>
               <p>"Now that we are ashore, you must take command," said the captain to Clarence. "I
                  will shoulder my musket, and do a soldier's duty, for the poor steamer is
                     <unclear>a</unclear> gone-in fact!"</p>
               <p>Clarence, thus urged, took charge, and with a soldier's ready tact and skill,
                  formed his encampment in a thick grove, a short distance back from the sea, where
                  the tents could be pitched easily, and safe from the force of the gale, and at
                  once posted sentinels at a proper distance around the camp, to avoid a
                  surprise.</p>
               <p>Darkness came on by the time that the camp was pitched and the provisions stored,
                  but camp-fires were lighted, and the men felt cheerful, while they listened to the
                  tempest which waged over the wild waters, for they felt that they had escaped a
                  great danger, the almost certainty of perishing at sea.</p>
               <p>"How far do you think we are from Indian River?" asked Clarence of Captain Duke,
                  after the sentinels had been posted, and all was <unclear>right</unclear> in the
                  camp.</p>
               <p>"Not more than thirty miles!" said the latter.</p>
               <p>"Then, to-morrow, we can easily go or send there!"</p>
               <p>"It is a hard country to travel over, lieu tenant!"</p>
               <p>"Not so hard as the Big Cypress, and I've traveled many a mile in that."</p>
               <p>"Not when you had a delicate woman to take care of!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, you need not fear for Ona! She is as light of foot, and as fleet as a
                  fawn!"</p>
               <p>"And will tire as soon, maybe!" said Duke, gloomily.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter of you to-night?" asked Clarence. "You are generally so gay
                  and light-hearted, that you keep everybody out of the <emph>blues!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Do you hear the poor old steamer breaking up?" replied Drake. "Before morning
                  there won't be one timber of her left stuck to another. And what's to come next I
                  don't know, but I feel as if something terrible <emph>was</emph> coming, and I
                  can't help it. You know, I am the last to whine without a reason, but there is a
                  feeling on me which I cannot shake off!"</p>
               <p>"Well, turn in, captain, and try and take some sleep. I shall act as officer of
                  the guard for the first half of the night. I will call you for the next
                  watch!"</p>
               <p>The captain went in gloomy silence to the tent which had been pitched for him, and
                  Clarence, after visiting Ona in her tent, and telling her to sleep without fear,
                  took his round of visit to the sentinels.</p>
               <p>So loud was the noise of the dashing surf and violent wind, that all other sounds
                  were drowned, and it was only when close to each other that their voices could be
                  understood. In consequence, the sentinels were cautioned to be very attentive, for
                  at such a time, a surprise could most easily be effected. And none but those who
                  have been engaged in warfare with the wily and treacherous savages, can imagine
                  their cunning, how much like the panther they creep upon their victims, how
                  merciless they are when they are successful.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XLVII.</head>
               <p>The night wore slowly on to Clarence, but he passed it away in his rounds to the
                  sentinels, visits to the front of the tent of his beloved, and in thinking of the
                  singular adventures which he had lately passed through. Unlike the captain, his
                  heart beat high with hope, and joyful anticipations of the future. He looked
                  forward to the hour when Ona should be his bride, and when he should have the
                  happiness to present her as a daughter, to his beloved mother.</p>
               <p>At twelve Clarence aroused a fresh guard of men from their slumbers, and proceeded
                  to relieve the guard. The new sentinels were cautioned particularly to be on the
                  alert, especially toward the approach of day, for it is supposed that men sleep
                  most soundly just at the end of night, and that time, more often than any other,
                  is selected for an attack. True it is with those who are not used to be forever on
                  the watch for a surprise, that when the greater part of the night has been passed
                  in safety, they relax in vigilance and caution.</p>
               <p>When Clarence went to arouse Captain Duke, he found him already awake.</p>
               <p>"I heard you when you changed the guard," said he, "but I did not leave my tent,
                  for I knew that you would come here when I was wanted. I have not yet closed my
                  eyes, nor can I. There is a weight upon my heart which I cannot heave off—I am
                  sure there is more trouble ahead!"</p>
               <p>"Pshaw, don't let such thoughts enter your brain; take 'a drop of comfort' from
                  that Schiedam case, and a walk in the fresh air, and you'll feel as lively as a
                  cricket!"</p>
               <p>The captain sighed, and (for a wonder), refused the "spiritual consolation"
                  indicated by Clarence; but he went out, and with the latter visited the different
                  sentinels, so as to learn the locations of their posts. Then Clarence returned,
                  and wrapping his military cloak around him, east himself down on the ground, in
                  front of Ona's tent, and was soon sound asleep.</p>
               <p>How long he lay in this slumber he knew not but he had a fearful dream. He thought
                  in it, that he was surrounded by a band of yelling savages, and that a huge
                  warrior was bearing Ona away, she struggling and screaming, but powerless in his
                  arms. He woke—the yells and her wild screams were all too real! He tried to rise,
                  but was thrust or knocked backward on the earth, and felt that his enemies were
                  binding him.</p>
               <p>It was almost dawn, and when the light same, a fearful sight presented itself to
                  his horrified vision. More than one-half of the men lay scalped where they had
                  been sleeping, for the sentinels had been struck down in their tracks, so silently
                  had their foes crept upon them. The residue of the men were bound captives like
                  himself, and prominent was the poor captain, bleeding from a wound in the head, by
                  which he was knocked senseless at the onslaught. Poor Ona was bound, too, but what
                  struck the most horror to the heart of Clarence, was the discovery that "Wild
                  Cat," or Coacoochee, was the principal leader of the savage band.</p>
               <p>"So, pale-face, and Arpiaka's squaw-child, belong to me once more! ugh! Me like
                  'em heap! Make young pale-face chief eat fire! Arpiaka's squaw shall see him dance
                  and hear him sing! Me laugh big heap, ugh!"</p>
               <p>"If I was free I'd make you laugh on the other side of your face, you red dog!"
                  said Clarence, bitterly.</p>
               <p>"Ugh! Much talk, you! By-and-bye, cry a little! Me laugh heap!" said Coacoochee,
                  delighted that his taunts had stirred Clarence to anger.</p>
               <p>A strong guard of the Indians was kept around the prisoners, but the main body of
                  them were engaged in pillaging from the wreck, the stores and materials of which
                  lay strewed up and down the beach in every direction.</p>
               <p>"See—they are at your liquor!" said Clarence, in a low tone, to Duke.</p>
               <p>"Yes, blast the infernal heathen, I wish it would <choice>
                     <sic>poisen</sic>
                     <corr>poison</corr>
                  </choice> them!" replied the captain.</p>
               <p>"It will make them drunk!" said Clarence.</p>
               <p>"And devilish!" said Duke.</p>
               <p>"Helpless and stupid, I hope, and then there may be a chance for our escape!" said
                  Clarence.</p>
               <p>"Not tied up, as we are, like a parcel of sheep, ready for the butcher!" growled
                  the captain.</p>
               <p>Poor Ona, pale and terror-stricken to the very heart, was silent all this time,
                  for, from the Indian's talk, which she <unclear>well</unclear> understood, she
                  learned that Clarence and all of the men were destined for the torture, while she
                  alone was to be spared for a fate to her worse than death, for Coacooche claimed
                  her as <emph>his</emph> prize.</p>
               <p>For a time Coacooche remained with his prisoners, and kept a keen watch over his
                  guard; but when he saw the prizes which the rest were finding on the beach, and
                  the "fire-water," for which he, like most red men, had a taste, he joined with the
                  others. For well he knew that his captives were safely bound, and were they even
                  loose, unarmed as they were, he would soon recapture them.</p>
               <p>Meantime, the red sun swept up the cloudless sky; for the storm had passed away,
                  though the great sees rolled heavily in from gulfward. And in the distance white
                  sails could be seen on the blue water, but they kept far away from the dreaded
                  coast, about which many a tale of red-handed murder had already been told.</p>
               <p>As the day shortened, the Indians, or many of them, at least, became intoxicated,
                  and though for a while furious and dangerous in their drunkenness, they at last
                  subsided into stupor. But Coacooche, though he had drank considerable liquor, was
                  too cunning to become to entirely helpless as the rest of his warriors; and their
                  women, who never drink, took the places of guards over the captives, as well as
                  their drunken lords.</p>
               <p>The agony of Clarence and the captain was very intense, for they had been bound in
                  most painful positions, and the cords had been drawn with all the force of
                  Coacoochee's hatred, and cut deep into their limbs. The chief had been more
                  careful of Ona, but she was secured so that, much as she desired it, she could not
                  relieve Clarence in his suffering. But she persuaded one of the squaws, by using
                  gentle words in her own language, to give them all water to cool their burning
                  lips, for they lay in the hot sun. And from this she hoped to gain yet other
                  favors, for the name of her father was great among all the Indians, and his power
                  was feared. So she commenced to speak to the squaw of her position.</p>
               <p>"I am Coacoochee's wife—<emph>he</emph> is my master, not Arpiaka!" replied the
                  woman, haughtily, looking at the chief, who had lain down under a tree near by,
                  and seemed to be sleeping.</p>
               <p>"Does the wife of Coacoochee love him?" asked Ona, determined to try to win her
                  way on a new track, and one most vulnerable in woman-nature, for show me the woman
                  who was never jealous, and I will point out her who never loved!</p>
               <p>"As the doe loves its mate—as the she-bear loves its cubs. I would
                     <emph>die</emph> for him!" replied the squaw.</p>
               <p>"And does Coacoochee love his wife?" continued Ona.</p>
               <p>"Does the sun shine? Does water run? Coacoochee loves Minataroh!"</p>
               <p>"Then why did he come to the lodge of Arpiaka, and ask him for his daughter, long
                  ago? Why did he seek to tear her away from her father's arms? Look at the last
                  scar on his body, the wound not yet all healed! It was got when he was trying to
                  get the daughter of Arpiaka to be his squaw! Why does he now keep me a captive
                  here?"</p>
               <p>"To make you eat fire!" replied Minataroh.</p>
               <p>"No!" said Ona. "He thinks that I am beautiful. He will burn my friends, but me he
                  will take to his lodge. He has said it. He will make me his wife, and tell you to
                  draw water, and bring wood, and cook for me!" said Ona.</p>
               <p>"The daughter of Arpiaka lies!" said the squaw, fiercely. "Minataroh will not be a
                  slave for her."</p>
               <p>"She will, unless Minataroh will loosen her bonds, and let her fly from the
                  presence of Coacoochee while he sleeps."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Go!</emph>" said the excited squaw, and, with a knife, she cut the bonds
                  which had confined Ona's limbs together.</p>
               <p>But, ere the latter could move, Coacoochee, with one bound, leaped from his
                  pretended slumber, and stood, with fiendish rage depicted in every look, before
                  her. His glittering hatchet was raised high above his head, and his flashing eyes
                  wandered from her to the squaw, who now knelt cowering at his feet. Death was in
                  his look, and Clarence trembled in unutterable agony for the life of poor Ona. The
                  glittering weapon was whirled around the Indian's head two or three times, then,
                  like lightning, it descended, and Clarence closed his eyes in horror as he heard
                  its dull crash when it entered the skull of the fiend's victim.</p>
               <p>Not a moan or a shriek followed the cruel act, and Clarence, thinking that she had
                  died without pain, and it was better than she should live and suffer, raised his
                  head to look once more upon her whom he so loved.</p>
               <p>Coacoochee was calmly wiping away the blood and brains from his hatchet, while one
                  of his feet rested upon the body of Minataroh, for <emph>she</emph>, and not Ona,
                  had fallen a sacrifice to his anger.</p>
               <p>"Arpiaka's squaw-child had better have kept her tongue close," said the grim
                  warrior, as he re-bound the horror-stricken girl, "She'll have to bring her own
                  wood and water, when she goes to the lodge of Coacoochee."</p>
               <p>"Does Coacoochee love money? Does he want arms, fine cloths, and rich presents?"
                  asked Clarence, hoping to tempt the cupidity of the Indian "If he will take me and
                  my companions to a post of my people, I will give him ten thousand dollars."</p>
               <p>"Money, heap, me like 'em, but love revenge more!" said the chief, haughtily.
                  "Today, Indians drunk—all fools. To-morrow they'll be sober, and then the
                  pale-faces shall eat fire and sing the death song. To-night, <emph>you</emph>
                  shall hear <emph>your</emph> squaw sing a new song, for she shall sleep in the
                  arms of Coacoochee. Then your heart will be glad to eat fire, eh?"</p>
               <p>"Accursed monster, let me loose but for one moment, and I'll teach
                     <emph>you</emph> a new song!" muttered Clarence, who forgot his bodily agony in
                  the thought that the infernal wretch might be so devilish as to carry out his
                  horrible threat, and force him to hear her cries of misery while he could not help
                  her. Such<pb n="96-97 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6989-00000049"/> torture, more
                  dreadful than any invented by even the demons of the Inquisition!</p>
               <p>The day wore slowly on, and night came, but it brought no relief to the suffering
                  party. The Indians, as they recovered from their first stupor, woke only to drink
                  again; but still the captives were guarded by Coacoochee, and others of the women,
                  who, knowing the fate of poor Minataroh, were careful not to risk offending him
                  who had slain her.</p>
               <p>The <unclear>pale</unclear> moon arose, and lighted up the scene with almost the
                  brilliancy of day. Even the camp fires seemed pale in its light. And Coacoochee,
                  led on by his taste, and apparently forgetful of his threat in regard to Ona,
                  again took to the fire-water; and it was with supreme joy that Clarence saw him
                  take from among the medical stores a bottle of antimonial wine, the taste of which
                  pleased him so much that he had nearly drained its contents before he began to
                  feel its sickening effects.</p>
               <p>When he did, and began to feel the deathly qualmishness, which was the natural
                  result of an emetic so very powerful, Clarence laughed aloud, and the Indian began
                  to feel fearfully alarmed.</p>
               <p>"Why does the pale-face chief laugh?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"Because Coacooche has drank poison, and will soon sing his death-song," said
                  Clarence, boldly.</p>
               <p>The Indian groaned fearfully, for the deathly sickness grew so fast upon him that
                  he felt as if he could not rise.</p>
               <p>"Ugh!" he groaned, as the cold sweat beaded out in large drops on his brow. "Ugh!
                  me sick heap. Ugh!" and he dashed the half-emptied bottle away.</p>
               <p>"If Coacoochee will do right, I can save him," said Clarence. "I can kill the
                  poison with medicine."</p>
               <p>"Kill it then—kill it quick—and me no kill you!" said Coacoochee, who began to
                  writhe with pain.</p>
               <p>"Release me and my friends, and I will," said Clarence. "Set us free, and give us
                  our arms, and I will give you the medicine."</p>
               <p>"Me set <emph>you</emph> free; the rest, no!" groaned the Indian.</p>
               <p>"Then die! See, the poison works!" cried Clarence, as the Indian writhed in pain,
                  and commenced vomiting fearfully.</p>
               <p>"Ugh! ugh! me heap sick. Give me the medicine," moaned the Indian, while the at
                  frighted squaws looked on in terror, and Captain Duke rolled and yelled with
                  laughter.</p>
               <p>"Go it, wild-eat," he cried. "Have up your leggins and moccasins, heave yourself
                  inside out! Ha! ha! ha! ho! ho! ho! he! he! he!"</p>
               <p>"Give me medicine, pale-face," moaned Coacoochee to Clarence, for he who would
                  have died without a word or groan upon the battle-field, was now more weak than a
                  woman.</p>
               <p>"Release your prisoners, and I will. Be quick, or it will be too late for me to
                  save you!" thundered Clarence, who felt that, through his terror, he could now
                  conquer the fiendish chief.</p>
               <p>Coacoochee, in the intervals of his spasms, muttered some orders to the squaws,
                  and, in a few moments, Clarence and the whole party were free and in the
                  possession of their arms. Then Clarence administered a large dose of sweet oil to
                  Coacoochee, and, after he had cast up the residue of the emetic from his stomach,
                  gave him a powerful dose of morphine, which soon left him in a slumber so profound
                  that he could not be awakened.</p>
               <p>Then, with Ona and the rest, he hurried away from the camp, determined to get as
                  far from it as possible before Coacoochee should recover and the drunken warriors
                  be able to follow.</p>
               <p>A short distance from the rear of the camp, they came upon a long and narrow
                  lagoon, where lay the canoes in which the Indians had come, some thirty or more in
                  number. The old captain uttered a cry of joy when he saw the water.</p>
               <p>"It connects with Indian River," he cried. "We can soon get to the fort there, and
                  then the red dogs may go to the devil for all I care for them. Me eat fire, eh?
                  I'll see them in Jericho first!"</p>
               <p>The first order which Clarence gave was to destroy and sink every canoe, except
                  just those which were necessary to contain his party alone. This done, looking
                  well that his arms were all in order, he pushed off with speed, taking the
                  direction which the captain assured him lead to the fort.</p>
               <p>But they did not make great speed, for the lagoon was crooked and narrow, and they
                  repeatedly grounded upon sand-bars, in consequence of being ignorant of the
                  channel.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XLVIII.</head>
               <p>The men were so much stiffened by having been bound so long, and the navigation of
                  the lagoon was so difficult, that Clarence knew that, when the day dawned, he had
                  not made more than six or seven miles in a direct course from the place of wreck,
                  and if, as Duke conjectured, the fort at Indian River was thirty miles from that,
                  they were still nearly a day's journey from it, or even more, at the rate they
                  went. But he urged the men on all that he could, for he feared the pursuit of the
                  Indians, who could very easily shoot down his men from the banks of the lagoon,
                  for in places it was very narrow, and nowhere was it more than a couple of hundred
                  yards in width.</p>
               <p>But, as the hot sun went up, the men began to grow faint, for, in their haste to
                  escape, provisions had been forgotten, and the water of the lagoon, from which
                  they drank, was bitter and brackish, and rather increased than assuaged their
                  thirst. But the captain and Clarence encouraged them to persevere, themselves
                  using paddles, and urging them forward by the oft-repeated thought that death was
                  in their rear, and safety only to be reached ahead.</p>
               <p>As the time lengthened, so did their efforts grow more and more faint, and, at
                  last, fierce yells, heard in the woods which skirted the lagoon behind them, told
                  Clarence that his worst fears were being realized. Like fierce bloodhounds, the
                  yelling fiends of the forest were upon their track.</p>
               <p>"God help us! we've got to fight our way now," said Clarence, as he looked back
                  and saw dusky forms glancing through the leafy covert.</p>
               <p>"Hadn't we better take cover and rest the men a little while?" said Captain Duke,
                  pointing to a small island in the centre of the lagoon, close to them, which,
                  being thickly wooded, would protect them from the fire of the Indians, and enable
                  them to return their shots with effect.</p>
               <p>"Yes, the idea is good," replied Clarence, steering toward the island.</p>
               <p>In a few moments they were all landed, and their canoes drawn up in the bushes.
                  After placing Ona in a spot where no chance ball could reach her, Clarence posted
                  his men behind trees, and waited the attack. It soon commenced, for the Indians,
                  led on by the enraged and disappointed Coacoochee, were furious. At first, they so
                  exposed themselves that several fell before the aim of Clarence and his men, who
                  felt a desire to avenge their murdered companions.</p>
               <p>But this only taught them caution, and, under cover, they took care of themselves,
                  while they still continued to fire on the whites whenever one of them showed the
                  smallest portion of his person. And, in a little while, constructing a raft, some
                  of them crossed the lagoon beyond the reach of musket shot, and now a fire was
                  opened on the island from both banks.</p>
               <p>This was bad enough, but not the worst trouble which Clarence had to meet. His
                  ammunition was almost expended, and he had to order his men to slacken their fire,
                  and only to shoot when a very fair chance occurred, lest the last shot should be
                  gone, and the Indians, learning the fact, should build more rafts and attack them
                  hand-to-hand, when the force of numbers would tell upon them fearfully, and,
                  probably, with a fatal result.</p>
               <p>The brave captain volunteered to take a single canoe, and, with three or four of
                  the strongest of the men, to try to run the gauntlet, and go to the fort for
                  assistance. But the attempt seemed to be utter madness in the day-time, and it
                  was, at any rate, deferred until night. Meantime, the Indians, evidently
                  understanding why the fire of the whites had slackened so much, began to build
                  rafts beyond gun-shot, and Clarence knew that a deadly struggle was at hand.</p>
               <p>But his heart did not fail. He rejoiced that he was free and had arms in his
                  hands, and could, at least, die like a man with his face to the foe, and not
                  suffer torture as he had anticipated before. Ona he knew would never fall alive
                  into the hands of Coacoochee, for she had sworn it, and had her dagger in her
                  bosom as a means of keeping that oath when dire necessity should call for it.</p>
               <p>Night drew on, and Clarence had but a few rounds of ammunition left, and the
                  Indians grew more and more bold every moment. Suddenly a shout of joy broke from
                  the lips of Captain Duke, who was stationed on the end of the island toward Indian
                  River.</p>
               <p>"The soldiers are coming! We're saved!" he shouted, and then he ran out upon the
                  bank, and waved a small American ensign which he had brought from his boat.</p>
               <p>The soldiers saw it, and cheered in response, while he was glad to take cover
                  again, for the Indian bullets flew like hail around him, grazing him in several
                  places.</p>
               <p>The Indians now opened fire upon the boats, but old Captain Winder was in charge
                  of the detachment, and what <emph>he</emph> didn't know about Indian fighting
                  wasn't worth knowing.<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6989-00000051"/> He landed his men
                  in two divisions on each bank of the lagoon, extending their lines to flank the
                  enemy, and charged, firing and loading at a run, and keeping cover on the advance.
                  The Indians couldn't stand this, but soon fled, leaving quite a number of their
                  party on the ground, and nearly all the plunder which they had brought from the
                  steamer.</p>
               <p>It was a happy moment when Clarence met his old friend Winder, after the skirmish
                  was over, and felt that, with an escort of over one hundred good men, and within
                  sixteen miles of the fort, he was once more safe, and that his chance of placing
                  his loved Ona beyond danger was good.</p>
               <p>After a brief rest, Captain Winder put fresh men in the canoes with those of
                  Clarence, and took the back course, and, following his pilot, the flotilla made a
                  rapid passage back to the post at Indian River, which they reached before the dawn
                  of day.</p>
               <p>Here Clarence was welcomed by many old comrades and friends, and he also found, to
                  his joy, that a steamer was in which was bound to St. Augustine, up the coast, and
                  would sail in a short time.</p>
               <p>Captain Duke, who had been at first very joyful at the escape of his party, now
                  again took the "blues," while he thought mournfully of the loss of his steamer.
                  But a written statement from Clarence and the other survivers, justifying his
                  actions in every particular, and giving him credit for his conduct in every sense,
                  consoled him somewhat—enough, at least, to allow him to "smile" once in a while,
                  when invited.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XLIX.</head>
               <p>Saint Augustine—the most ancient, yet the smallest, city of North America. Quaint
                  and antique in its narrow streets, over which neighbors can shake-hands from the
                  porticoes of their ever-lasting stone houses; in its old-time church; in its walls
                  now crumbled, and in its ditches now filled up; and in its massive and strong
                  fort—the prettiest piece of military art in the country. And beautiful in its
                  groves of orange, lemon, citron and lime—in its trees of fig and of magnolia.
                  Lovely, too, in its flowery gardens, but loveliest in its beautiful women, who are
                  as good and pure as they are enchanting. It is a boast of that proud city that but
                  one illegitimate child was ever born there, and its mother was American, not
                  Spanish.</p>
               <p>City of Romance, of Poetry, of Chivalry, and of Song! Home of gladness and of
                  festal joys! Happy, <emph>happy</emph> have been the hours which I have passed
                  within thy limits, dancing feet, and glancing eyes, and joyous hearts around
                  me!</p>
               <p>But gone is the light of those blessed days! Cold is the fond heart which there
                  beat for me, for me only! A shadow rests upon my spirit, and it is the hand of
                  Memory which has placed it there.</p>
               <p>A few days after the rescue of Clarence and his party, they were safely landed in
                  the ancient city, and the lieutenant and Ona, with Captain Duke, were soon
                  ensconced in Ben Carr's princely hotel, "The Magnolia."</p>
               <p>Clarence had many acquaintances in the little city, for his regiment had been
                  posted there, and in a very short time his arrival was made known through the
                  place, and also, through the agency of the warm-hearted and well-meaning Captain
                  Duke, his recent strange and thrilling adventures, and all of the history of Ona
                  which the worthy captain knew—probably a little more, for the good man never let a
                  story shrink any while it was in <emph>his</emph> custody.</p>
               <p>The consequence was that Clarence was completely over-run with calls, and
                  solicitations for an introduction to his heroine. But she could make no new
                  acquaintances just then. By the desire of Clarence, she was very busy in
                  consultation <emph>with</emph>, and giving directions <emph>to</emph>, sundry
                  milliners and dress-makers, through whose fashionable officiousness it soon became
                  known that a wedding was to come off at short notice at the "Magnolia."</p>
               <p>Captain Duke was in his glory. He was to have the honor of giving away the bride.
                  He almost forgot the loss of his steamer, and his frequent invitations to "smile
                  all around" made him very popular and profitable at the bar of the hotel.</p>
               <p>It took but a few days to make the necessary arrangements, and then, in the
                  presence of as gay and gallant a party as had ever there assembled, Ona Livingston
                  became the wedded wife of Clarence Febiger.</p>
               <p>I need not describe the solemn, yet happy ceremony, nor the festive scenes which
                  followed. The reader, without that reader is a luckless bachelor or an old maid,
                  can imagine and appreciate it all better than I can describe it.</p>
               <p>Clarence waited only for a few days to receive visits and congratulations, and
                  then, by the first steamer to Savannah, started northward, to visit home and see
                  his loved mother. That his voyage may be prosperous let us hope, while we again
                  cast our eyes southward.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER L.</head>
               <p>The rage of the scalded colonel was furious when he heard that the steamer of
                  Captain Duke had left, and that Clarence Febiger was forever beyond his reach. He
                  exhibited his feelings by singling out every prominent friend of Clarence's, and
                  ordering them on the most severe and unpleasant duty which he could conceive.</p>
               <p>When the news came that the steamer of Captain Duke had been totally lost, and the
                  crew and passengers captured by the Indians, he fairly danced up and down with
                  glee. But his joy was dampened when the officer, who previously read the account,
                  in a slow and disconnected manner, announced the escape and gallant conduct of
                  Clarence, and the final rescue of the party.</p>
               <p>"He was a noble fellow, and the service lost a jewel in him!" said Captain
                  Fulton.</p>
               <p>"A cursed mutinous scoundrel, who left the service to escape the penalty of a
                  court martial!" muttered the colonel.</p>
               <p>The officer continued reading the account, and when he came to the splendid
                  reception which Clarence met at the hands of the hospitable citizens of St.
                  Augustine, and his marriage with the beautiful Ona Livingston, the reputed heiress
                  of immense wealth, the wrath of the colonel broke out in curses.</p>
               <p>"I don't believe a word of it!" he cried. "It's a newspaper lie!"</p>
               <p>The officer who had the paper, purposely added to the already profuse praises and
                  descriptions in the paper, for he, with the officers, vastly enjoyed the annoyance
                  and mortification of the colonel.</p>
               <p>But he, unfortunately, had the power to annoy them also, and the very next morning
                  he issued an order for a scout into the malarious region of the Big Cypress,
                  almost always fatal to those who were not acclimated. Captain Fulton was placed in
                  command, and all of the obnoxious officers to his tyrantship, were also
                  detailed.</p>
               <p>Unpleasant as this was, orders had to be obeyed, no matter what they were, for
                  rank and power were in <emph>his</emph> hands, also <emph>political</emph>
                  influence at the seat of government, and to disobey would have periled the
                  commissions of all subordinates. But many were the left-handed blessings showered
                  upon the head of the tyrant by the sufferers, and had he been dying, it is
                  doubtful whether any of them would have shed a tear, or taken much pains to avert
                  such a fate for him.</p>
               <p>It is ever easy for a commanding officer to win the respect and love of all
                  subordinate to him, if he possesses the qualities of a soldier, and the courtesy
                  of a gentleman. But if he lacks these, and plays the part of a tyrant, he still
                  more easily incurs their hatred, and makes for himself a name that can never be
                  restored to lustre.</p>
               <p>The expedition proceeded into the everglades, however, very cheerfully, for the
                  hated colonel did not choose to risk his precious person with it, and all knew
                  that the gallant Fulton would render their duty as light as possible for them.</p>
               <p>They had been absent nearly a week, when a flag of truce, born by a negro, with a
                  letter to the commanding officer, reached Captain Fulton. The words of the letter
                  were these: <q>
                     <p>"If the commanding officer of the American forces will guarantee the safety
                        of the writer, who is a white resident, and non-combatant among the poor and
                        persecuted Seminoles, he would seek an interview with him. He seeks tidings
                        in regard to the welfare of his only child!"</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Captain Fulton at once knew that this was from the father of Ona, and he hastened
                  to reply, by a note, which read as follows</p>

               <p>It is an old adage, I believe, at any rate it is a true saying, that "bad news
                  flies upon rapid pinions."</p>
               <p>Poor Mrs. Febiger had heard of the disappearance and supposed fate of her loved
                  and only son, and the blow had nearly been fatal to her. It had reached her
                  through the daily paper, in which she invariably looked for "News from Florida."
                  The man who penned the <choice>
                     <sic>paragragh</sic>
                     <corr>paragraph</corr>
                  </choice>, and who suggested, on his own responsibility of thought, that poor
                  Clarence had probably been roasted, and, perhaps, eaten little dreamed what a pang
                  he caused by what he really thought was witty on his part. Newspaper writers, who
                  dash off articles merely to fill up, seldom pause to think of the harm they may
                  do, or the woe they may bring by a careless line or two, or an
                     "<emph>embellishment</emph> of facts," as they term an extra lie or two, or
                  some suggestive witticism—Heaven save the mark!—upon those who do not know the
                  tricks of the trade, and that some editors, like the generality of lawyers, get so
                  used to lying, that they only tell the truth by accident. A political editor who
                  will not lie till all is blue for his party, isn't worth damning. Even religious
                  editors will lie roundly for their sect, as their ministers will
                     <emph>almost</emph> swear that the road they've macadamized is the only
                  'through route' to heaven.</p>
               <p>Messrs. Blacking and Queer, who, like wine well put up, really improved by age,
                  and most singularly and unaccountably <emph>for</emph> the age and its custom,
                  became better, more honest and less grasping, as they accumulated wealth, called
                  upon her at an early hour, not only to offer their sympathy and condolence, but,
                  far better, to give to her sad heart hope that her son had escaped, and would yet
                  be restored to her. This thought, enlivened by them, helped her to bear her
                  sorrow, and, to a great degree, enabled her to meet and bear a shock of pleasure
                  which she received long weeks afterward, when she had become almost reconciled to
                  the thought of believing him dead.</p>
               <p>This shock came in this way: One morning, very early—she had, however risen, for
                  she was not one of those <emph>she lazinesses</emph> that thinks it necessary to
                  swelter in bed till noon—the servant announced Counsellor Blacking and Mr. Amasa
                  Queer.</p>
               <p>"Something unusual has surely brought them here at this early hour!" said she, as
                  she ordered the servant to admit them at once. "They <emph>must</emph> have heard
                  from Clarence! Yet there is no news from Florida in the <title>Herald</title> this
                  morning. I have looked it all over!"</p>
               <p>"Good morning, my dear Mrs. Febiger!" said Blacking, in his smooth, bland, calm
                  way.</p>
               <p>"Good <emph>morning</emph>, my <emph>dear</emph> Mrs. Febiger!" said Mr. Amasa
                  Queer, rather nervously, the corner of his lips twitching as if there was
                  something in his mouth which wanted to get out.</p>
               <p>"Good morning, gentlemen," said the widow, gently, and with a cheerful voice.
                  "Take seats. I know that you have brought me good news, by your looks. You have
                  heard from my dear Clarence!"</p>
               <p>"Wonderful, surprising, that you should anticipate our errand!" said Mr.
                  Blacking.</p>
               <p>"Extraordinary, astonishing, really, isn't it?" said Mr. Queer, who could not sit
                  still, but moved about as if he had a mustard plaster beneath him—pardon the
                  simile, reader, for I have been sick recently, and know the feelings which such a
                  plaster produces.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my dear madam, I am happy to say that we have heard from Clarence, your
                  brave and gallant son!"</p>
               <p>"Is he <emph>alive?</emph>" asked Mrs. F., in a tone, and with a look of deep
                  anxiety.</p>
               <p>"Alive, dear madam!" said Blacking.</p>
               <p>"And <emph>married!</emph> he! he! ho! ho!" cried Queer, breaking out in one of
                  his queer laughs. "I'll make his children heirs to my property, so I will—alive
                  and married—he! he! ho! ho! ho!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Queer got up, and improvised a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">solo
                     quadrille</foreign> all over the carpet, to celebrate his joy upon the
                  occasion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Blacking, however, more coolly produced the paper containing the account of
                  Clarence's adventures, marriage, etc., and proceeded, with his usual precise
                  deliberation, to read it. The eyes of the widow glittered with tears while she
                  listened to the narration, but they were tears of joy which filled her blue eyes,
                  and they laid there like dew upon the flowers, glittering in the early
                  sunlight.</p>
               <p>The counsellor had just finished the newspaper account when a servant entered,
                  bringing a letter which had been left by the postman.</p>
               <p>"From Clarence!" she murmured, as she broke the seal.</p>
               <p>"Please read it aloud, if it is not too private!" said Mr. Blacking.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Do,</emph> dear madam, I am dying to hear what the noble boy says about
                  himself and about—about getting <emph>married!</emph>" cried Mr. Queer.</p>
               <p>The widow could not refuse, and she read: <q>
                     <p>"Dear mother, I write in haste to say to you that I am coming home to you,
                        never to leave you again, for I have resigned from the service. I shall
                        reach you almost as soon as this letter will. And I shall bring home a
                        precious treasure with me, in the shape of the prettiest, best, dearest,
                        little wife that ever made a husband happy!"</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"That's what <emph>all</emph> men say of their wives!" said Mr. Queer.</p>
               <p>"When they are <emph>first</emph> married!" said Mr. Blacking, with more truth
                  than gallantry.</p>
               <p>Mrs. F. did not reply to these remarks, but continued reading the letter</p>

               <p>"A carriage at the door, madam—a carriage and an express wagon with baggage, and a
                  gentleman and a lady!" said a servant, entering just after Mrs. Febiger had closed
                  the letter.</p>
               <p>"Oh, my God—my son!" said Mrs. Febiger, and she tried to rise, but a sudden
                  faintness came over her.</p>
               <p>"Water!" cried Mr. Blacking.</p>

               <p>But she needed neither when the well-known form of Clarence burst into the room,
                  for she rose and rushed into his arms, bursting into a flood of tears as she did
                  so.</p>
               <p>Such tears are only an outlet to a heart overcharged with joy, and relieve it in a
                  moment.</p>
               <p>And Mrs. Febiger was more calm when her son turned and placed the hand of his
                  sweet Ona in hers. More embracing, more kissing, more sobbing, but all indicative
                  of excessive joy.</p>
               <p>After a few moments of this feeling, Mrs. Febiger was calm enough to introduce the
                  counsellor and Mr. Queer to Clarence and his wife as very dear friends, who, in
                  her hours of trouble, had proved true and trusty.</p>
               <p>"Rest assured that I shall never forget you, gentlemen!" said Clarence, after the
                  usual salutations had passed.</p>
               <p>"And we—we will remember you in—in <emph>our wills!</emph> Won't we, brother
                  Blacking?" said Queer, almost crying for joy.</p>
               <p>"Most assuredly, Amasa!" said the lawyer. Then turning to Ona, he added: "I am
                  your father's agent, sweet lady, and any money you want you can draw!"</p>
               <p>"I believe I have some papers for you to look at!" said she, mildly; "but we will
                  Rot mar the happiness of this hour by speaking or thinking of business!"</p>
               <p>"No; I feel as if I could sing and dance like a boy just let out of school!" said
                  Mr. Queer.</p>
               <p>"Let us go, Amasa! let us go, for Mr. Febiger has much to say to his mother, which
                  we, old covies, have no business to hear!" said Mr. Blacking.</p>
               <p>"You must return at four, gentlemen, to dine with us!" said the widow.</p>
               <p>"Yes; our happiness will not be complete without you!" added Clarence.</p>
               <p>"We'll come; and if I don't send up some of OSBORN'S old Port and some of
                  BENNINGER'S best Amontillada, I'll never put a foot in Wall street!" cried Mr.
                  Queer.</p>
               <p>The two old gentlemen now departed arm in arm; Mr. Blacking with a livelier step
                  than usual, and Mr. Queer giving a hop and a skip every little while, as he went
                  along, like a little fairy whom I know, named Blanche, when she is on her way to a
                  fair.</p>
               <p>"Let's go to the Tontine, brother Blacking, and there renew in a 'pony' of brandy,
                  the covenant which we made many, many years ago!" cried Mr. Queer.</p>
               <p>"Under the circumstances, I believe I will!" said Mr. Blacking. "I see no
                  impropriety in it!"</p>
               <p>And they proceeded "unanimously" to carry the motion into effect, nothing
                     occurring<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6989-00000053"/> to interrupt them, except
                  a petition from a poor devil of a <unclear>broken</unclear> down editor to Queer
                  to discount a note of fifty dollars for him.</p>
               <p>"Here's fifty dollars; curse the note!" said Mr. Queer, not unkindly, however.</p>
               <p>"When shall I pay you? this relief is too kind <unclear>sir</unclear>; when shall
                  I pay you?" asked the astonished knight of the quill.</p>
               <p>"When you are rich and happy, like me—go along now, not another word!" and he
                  hurried on toward the Tontine.</p>
               <p>The poor editor shook his head sorrowfully, and murmured: "That will never,
                     <emph>never</emph> be! It's not down in the books. 'Tis neither written in
                  heaven, known on earth, or dreamed of below. If I could find a rich and happy
                  editor. I would make my fortune by exhibiting him at sixpence a peep! A happy
                  editor! Barnum would hunt the world over, if he heard of one, but what he'd have
                  him! Get out with your wooly horses, your Joyce Heath's, nigger-baby-shows, and
                  codfish mermaids! Just show me a <emph>live</emph>, rich, happy editor, or tell me
                  that one ever lived!"</p>
               <p>And away rushed the editor, with the enormous amount of fifty dollars in his
                  pocket, determined to have a "burst" on a plate of clam soup and a threepenny
                  glass of beer.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER LIII.</head>
               <p>Years had passed since the Florida war had been declared at an end by the gallant
                  Worth, yet a few more invincible spirits still refused to migrate to the west, a
                  few noble Seminoles clung to the land of their fathers and the graves of their
                  sires, a staunch and Spartan band, who deserved a better fate than to be hunted
                  down and butchered by the hired menials of the government. But, at last, driven
                  almost to desperation, their crops and homes all destroyed, their ammunition all
                  expended, and their last bows broken, nearly all of them surrendered, with
                  "Bowlegs," their last war-chief, and consented to migrate to the land of the
                  setting sun.</p>
               <p>But still a few remained, hidden away in the dark and gloomy shades of the Big
                  Cypress, from which the sharp-fanged hounds of their foes could not drive them.
                  They were the devoted followers of Arpiaka, the "White Wizard," now dwindled down
                  to a very few in number, but still faithful to him whom they reverenced for his
                  goodness and his wisdom.</p>
               <p>Known to the whites as "Sam Jones," he had eluded every attempt to capture him,
                  and had only been seen on one or two occasions by them during the whole war. He
                  was never known to use arms in any battle, but he ever proved himself true to
                  those who had adopted him, and if he yet lives he is true to them, for he never
                  will leave the land of his adoption, the clime where sleeps all that is mortal of
                  his lost IONE. When last heard from he was very old, his hair white as the driven
                  snow, and his eye-sight so dim that he could scarcely note the changing hues of
                  heaven in sunshine or in storm. Letters have often passed between him and his
                  loved child, but he has never seen her or Clarence since, though beautiful
                  children have grown up for them, and they have been blessed with great
                  happiness.</p>
               <p>Clarence has recently built a very handsome country-seat on the Carloosahatchie
                  River, where he spends his winters, and whither two old gentlemen, who are very
                  fond of his children, accompany him invariably. I need not tell you who they
                  are.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Marcus Febiger is gliding like an autumn leaf upon a golden river, slowly
                  down the tide of life, loving Ona almost as much as her husband does, and no
                  mortal ought to be loved more.</p>
               <p>Wealthy, honored, respected by all who know them, the Febigers, either at their
                  splendid home in the Fifth avenue, their summer cottage up the Hudson, or at their
                  beautiful residence in Florida, are HAPPY.</p>
               <p>Captain Duke still runs a boat in the U. S. service.</p>
               <p>Reader, my story is told. I hope you feel as if you had got your money's worth! It
                  is my private opinion that you have.</p>
