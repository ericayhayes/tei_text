            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I HAVE dedicated this little volume of essays to Mr. Verplanck, not only because of
               his constant and kindly feelings, always expressed toward the Editor; not only
               because of the constant and kindly interest he has taken in the literary efforts of
               all younger American authors; nor yet from mere admiration of his vast acquirements
               in all fields of knowledge; nor from his extensive life-long labors for the public
               welfare, during which<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6182-00000004"/> patriotism and
               disinterestedness, far-reaching wisdom and patient modesty, have been his constant
               companions; nor yet because he is one of the few left of the illustrious literary
               past; nor yet from the long tradition of his pure and spotless life, as befits the
               Christian gentleman; nor from any, or all of these, but simply because I felt that
               some affectionate tribute was due from me to him—my honored and venerable friend.</p>
            <p>The papers included in this volume are partly from the <title>Wine Press,</title> a
               monthly periodical, which I edited for seven years—until the breaking out of the
               civil war—with some new articles, and with various essays of the author, that have
               heretofore been printed on the sands of fugitive magazines and newspapers. Some of
               these shells and pebbles bles I have reclaimed; the rest lie upon the beach
               unnoticed, and, happily, unknown.</p>
            <p>From the original articles contibuted to the <title>Wine Press</title>—independent of
               the author's own—I have selected some others to grace this little book. The articles,
               "Was Champagne known to the Ancients," and "Oxyporian Wines," are from the pen of Mr.
               Verplanck; Mr. Paul Dinet, of Ay, Champagne, wrote "A French Breakfast," a
               composition of his own, but which, with an author's license, he attributed to Brillat
               Savarin. Professor Walcott Gibbs, who has as exquisite a taste for true humor as any
               writer in the country, translated the "Hare and the Hedgehog," a story that will
               commend itself whenever you read it to the little people; aye, and sometimes to older
               folks, as I have experiencd. Mr. Chas. G. Leland, wrote<pb n="6-7"
                  xml:id="VAC6182-00000005"/> the "Dainty Hints," to Epicurean Smokers; Mr. Henry P.
               Leland contributed the sparkling sketch of "A German Wine Cellar;" and Col. Peter A.
               Porter, who lost his life at the battle of Cold Harbor, in leading a charge at the
               head of his gallant regiment (the 8th New York Artillery), contributed the excellent
               imitation of Macauley's History of England. Those who knew him best will appreciate
               how much the Empire State has lost in losing him. The article "Does Queen Victoria
               Speak English," and "Sitka," were written originally for the <title>New York
                  Ledger.</title> By the courtesy of Mr. Bonner, I have included them in this
               volume.</p>
            <p>To General Wm. A. Hammond, late Surgeon General of the United States Army, I owe my
               thanks for his indefatigable perseverance in urging ing me to collect these papers.
               If they find any success with the public, thanks be to him who urged me to publish
               them, and took the greater task in preparing them for the press.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>I. A Talk About Tea.</head>
               <p>"SIR," said our learned friend, Dr. Bushwhacker, "we are indebted to China for the
                  four principal blessings we enjoy. Tea came from China, the compass came from
                  China, printing came from China, and gunpowder came from China—thank God! China,
                  sir, is an old country, a very old country. There is one word, sir, we got from
                  China, that is oftener in the mouths of American people than any other word in the
                  language. It is <emph>cash,</emph> sir, cash! That we derive from the Chinese. It
                  is the name, sir, of the small brass coin they use, the coin with a square hole in
                  the middle. And then look at our Franklin; he drew the lightning from<pb n="2-3"
                     xml:id="VAC6182-00000008"/> the skies with his kite; but who invented the kite,
                  sir? The long-tailed Chinaman, sir, Franklin had no invention; he never would have
                  invented a kite or a printing-press. But he could use them, sir, to the best
                  possible advantage, sir; he had no genius, sir, but he had remarkable talent and
                  industry. Then, sir, we get our umbrella from China; the first man that carried an
                  umbrella, in London, in Queen Anne's reign, was followed by a mob. That is only
                  one hundred and fifty years ago. We get the art of making porcelain from China.
                  Our ladies must thanks the Celestials for their tea-pots. Queen Elizabeth never
                  saw a tea-pot in her life. In 1664, the East India Company bought two pounds two
                  ounces of tea as a present for his majesty, King Charles the Second. In 1667, they
                  imported one hundred pounds of tea. Then, sir, rose the reign of scandal—Queen
                  Scandal, sir! Then, sir, rose the intolerable race of waspish spinsters who sting
                  reputations and defame humanity over their dyspeptic cups. Then, sir, the
                  astringent principle of the herb was communicated to the heart, and domestic
                  troubles were brewed and fomented over the tea-table. Then, sir, the age of
                  Chivalry was over, and women grew acrid and bitter; then, sir, the first
                  temperance society was founded, and high duties were laid upon wines, and in
                  consequence they distilled whiskey instead, which made matters a great deal
                  better, of course; and all the abominations, all the difficulties of domestic
                  life, all the curses of living in a country village; the intolerant canvassing of
                  character. reputation, piety; the nasty, mean, prying spirit; the uncharitable,
                  defamatory, gossiping, tale bearing, whispering, unwomanly, unchristianlike
                  behavior of those who set themselves up for patterns over their vile decoctions,
                  sir, arose with the introduction of tea. Yes, sir; when the wine-cup, gave place
                  to the tea-cup, then the devil, sir, reached his culminating point. The curiosity
                  of Eve was bad enough; but, sir, when Eve's curiosity becomes sharpened by turgid
                  tonics, and scandal is added to inquisitiveness, and inuendo supplies the place of
                  truth, and an imperfect digestion is the pilot instead of charity; then, sir, we
                  must expect to see human nature vilified, and levity condemned, and good
                  fellowship condemned, and all good men, from Washington down, damned by Miss
                  Tittle, and Miss Tattle, and the Widow Blackleg, and the whole host of
                  tea-drinking conspirators against social enjoyment." Here Dr. Bushwhacker grew
                  purple with eloquence and indignation. We ventured to remark that he had spoken of
                  tea "as a blessing" at first. "Yes, sir," responded Dr. Bushwhacker, shaking his
                  bushy head, "that reminds one of Doctor Pangloss. Yes, sir, it is a blessing, but
                  like all other blessings it must be used <emph>temperately,</emph> or else it is a
                  curse! China, sir," continued the Doctor, dropping the oratorical, and taking up
                  the historical, "China, sir, knows nothing of perspective, but she is great in
                  pigments. Indian ink, sir, is Chinese, so are ver-million and indigo; the
                  malleable properties of gold, sir,<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6182-00000009"/> were
                  first discovered by this extraordinary people; we must thank them for our gold
                  leaf. Gold is not a pigment, but roast pig is, and Charles Lamb says the origin of
                  roast pig is Chinese; the beautiful fabric we call silk, sir, came from the
                  Flowery Nation, so did embroidery, so did the game of chess, so did fans. In fact,
                  sir, it is difficult to say what we have not derived from the Chinese. Cotton,
                  sir, is our great staple, but they wove and spun long staple and short staple,
                  yellow cotton and white cotton before Columbus sailed out of the port of Palos in
                  the Santa Maria."</p>
               <p>"But, Doctor, we want a word with you about tea. A little information, if you
                  please."</p>
               <p>The Doctor is one of our old Knickerbockers. His big, bushy head is as familiar as
                  the City Hall. He belongs to the "God bless you my dear young friend" school! He
                  is as full of knowledge as an egg is full of meat. He knows more about China than
                  the Emperor of the celestial people.</p>
               <p>"Tea, my young friend, is a plant that grows in China, Japan, and other parts of
                  the world. There are two varieties. <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Thea nigra</foreign>
                  and <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Thea viridis</foreign>—black tea and green tea. The
                  same plant, sir, produces both kinds. Green tea is made by one kind of
                  manipulation, black tea by another. That is all, sir. The shrub is raised from
                  seeds like hazel nuts, planted in nurseries; it is set out when about a foot high;
                  lives for fifteen or twenty years, grows sometimes as tall as General Scott and
                  sometimes as small as Bill Seward. It is picked four times a year. The first
                  picking is the best, when the leaves are covered with a whitish down. This is in
                  April, the next is in May, the next is in July, the last in August. One Chinaman
                  can pick about thirteen pounds of leaves per day, for which he will receive sixty
                     <emph>cash,</emph> or six cents. The green leaves are spread out on bamboo
                  frames to dry a little, the yellow and old defective leaves are picked out, then
                  they take up a handful of the leaves, cast them in a heated pan, get them warmed
                  up, and squeeze out the superfluous juice; this juice contains an acrid oil, so
                  acrid as to irritate the hands of the workman. Good God! think of that, sir, what
                  stuff for the stomach. Then they dry them slightly in the sun, then every separate
                  leaf is rolled up into a little ball like a shot, then they throw these green tea
                  shot into a pan slightly heated, stirring them up so as to warm every part alike;
                  then they cool the tea, and the shot are picked out one by one, the best for the
                  first or finest chop. Every little ball picked over by hand. Then it is packed,
                  sir. The young leaves make the 'Young Hyson,' the older and stronger leaves the
                  'Hyson,' the refuse goes by the name of 'Hyson Skin,' the 'Gunpowder' and
                  'Imperial' are teas rolled more carefully in rounder balls than the others. Most
                  of these teas are colored for our market—colored, sir, with a mixture of Prussian
                  blue and gypsum; no wonder John Chinaman calls us outside barbarians, when he
                  knows we drink half a pound of gypsum and Prussian blue with every<pb n="6-7"
                     xml:id="VAC6182-00000010"/> hundred pounds of green tea, and this tea is made
                  to order! Does honest John ever drink such tea? No, sir, he knows better than that
                  if he does wear a tail."</p>
               <p>"And black tea, you say, is from the same plant, Doctor?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, Mr. Robert Fortune brought specimens of the <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >Thea nigra</foreign> from the Bohea mountains and compared them with the
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Thea viridis,</foreign> and the plants were identical.
                  The black tea, sir, is prepared in a different manner from the other. The leaves
                  are allowed to lie spread out on the bamboo trays for a considerable time; then
                  they are thrown up into the air by the workman, tossed about, beat, patted, until
                  they become soft or flaccid, then tossed in heaps, allowed to lie until they begin
                  to change color, then they are tossed in a tea-pan, roasted over a hotter fire,
                  rolled, shaken out, exposed to the air again, turned over, partially dried, put in
                  the pan a second time for five minutes or so, then rolled, tossed over, and
                  tumbled again, then put into a sieve, put over the fire again, rolled about, put
                  over again, three or four times, then placed in a basket, thickly packed together;
                  the Chinaman makes a hole through the mass of leaves with his hand to give vent to
                  the smoke and steam; then over the fire they go, and remain there until they are
                  perfectly dry—in fact, sir, until the fire dies out. Then picked, packed, and
                  assorted for the market. Now, sir, here is the difference between black tea and
                  green tea, the latter retains all its acrid properties, it produces nervous
                  irritability, sleeplessness lessness, sir; why, if you take a pinch of green tea
                  and chew it, sir, you can sit and listen to Dr. ——'s sermon and keep wide awake
                  sir—a thing impossible to do under any other circumstances. But black tea has much
                  of this oil dried out of it, and therefore it is less injurious than the other;
                  less injurious, I say, not harmless by any means. Do you ever travel in the
                  country? Well, sir, there you will see the ravages of green tea, Prussian blue,
                  and gypsum among the fairest portion of creation—women! There, sir, you will see
                  pinched-up, penurious, prying faces—faces made up of a complication of fine lines,
                  as if all human sympathies had got into a tangle; necks all wrinkles; fingers, a
                  beautiful exhibition of bones, ligaments, and tendons; eyes, sharp, restless,
                  inquisitive; shoulders, drooping; bust, nowhere; viscera, collapsed, and the
                  muscular system, or the form divine generally, in a state of dubiety; yes, sir,
                  and all this comes from the constant use of '<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Thea
                     viridis,</foreign>' sir, green tea, sir. Our forefathers, sir, threw the tea
                  overboard in Boston harbor; if people knew what we of the faculty know, sir, they
                  would do the same thing now, sir, with every chop that comes from the celestial
                  empire."</p>

               <head>II. Journey around a Tapioca Pudding.</head>
               <p>DR. BUSHWHACKER folded his napkin, drew it through the silver ring, laid it on the
                  table, folded his arms, leaned back in his chair, by which we knew there was
                  something at work in his knowledge-box. "My dear Madam," said he, with a Metamora
                  shake of the head, "there are a great many things to be said about that
                  pudding."</p>
               <p>Now, such a remark at a season of the year when eggs are five for a shilling, and
                  not always fresh at that, is enough to discomfort any body. The Doctor perceived
                  it at once, and instantly added, "In a <emph>geographical</emph> point of view,
                  there are many things to be said about that pudding. My dear madam," he continued,
                  "take tapioca itself; what is it, and where does it come from?"</p>
               <p>Our eldest boy, just emerging from chickenhood, answered, "85 Chambers street, two
                  doors below the Irving House."</p>
               <p>"True, my dear young friend," responded the Doctor, with a friendly pat on the
                  head; "true, but that is not what I mean. Where," he repeated, with a questioning
                  look through his spectacles, and a Bushwhackian nod, "does tapioca come from?"</p>
               <p>"Rio de Janeiro and Para!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; from Rio de Janeiro in the southern, and Para in the northern part of
                  the Brazils, do we get our tapioca; from the roots of a plant called the Mandioca,
                  botanically, the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Jatropha Manihot,</foreign> or, as they
                  say, the Cassava. The roots are long and round, like a sweet potato; generally a
                  foot or more in length. Every joint of the plant will produce its roots like the
                  cuttings of a grape-vine. The tubers are dug up from the ground, peeled, scraped,
                  or grated, then put in long sacks of flexible rattan; sacks, six feet long or
                  more, and at the bottom of the sack they suspend a large stone, by which the
                  flexible sides are contracted, and then out pours the cassava-juice in a pan
                  placed below to receive it. This juice is poisonous, sir, highly poisonous, and
                  very volatile. Then, my dear madam, it is macerated in water, and the residum,
                  after the volatile part, the poison, is evaporated, is the innocuous farina, which
                  looks like small crumbs of bread, and which we call tapioca. The best kind of
                  tapioca comes from Rio, which is, I believe, about five thousand five hundred
                  miles from New York; so we must put down that as a little more than one fifth of
                  our voyage around the pudding."</p>
               <p>This made our eldest open his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Eggs and milk," continued Dr. Bushwhacker, "are home productions; but sugar,
                  refined sugar, is made partly of the moist and sweet yellow sugar of Louisiana,
                  partly of the hard and dry sugar of the West Indies; I<pb n="10-11"
                     xml:id="VAC6182-00000012"/> will not go into the process of refining sugar now,
                  but I may observe here, that the sugar we get from Louisiana, if refined and made
                  into a loaf, would be quite soft, with large loose crystals, while the Havana
                  sugar, subjected to the same treatment, would make a white cone almost as compact
                  and hard as granite. But we have made a trip to the Antilles for our sugar, and so
                  you may add fifteen hundred miles more for the saccharine."</p>
               <p>"That is equal to nearly one-third of the circumference of the pudding we live
                  upon, Doctor."</p>
               <p>"Vanilla," continued the Doctor, "with which this pudding is so delightfully
                  flavored, is the bean of a vine that grows wild in the multitudinous forests of
                  Venezuela, New Granada, Guiana, and, in fact, throughout South America. The long
                  pod, which looks like the scabbard of a sword, suggested the name to the
                  Spaniards; vagna, meaning scabbard, from which comes the diminutive, vanilla, or
                  little scabbard—appropriate enough, as every one will allow. These beans, which
                  are worth here from six to twenty dollars a pound, could be as easily cultivated
                  as hops in that climate; but the indolence of the people is so great, that not one
                  Venezuelian has been found with sufficient enterprise to set out one acre of
                  vanilla, which would yield him a small fortune every year. No, sir. The poor
                  peons, or peasants, raise their garabanzas for daily use, but beyond that they
                  never look. They plant their crops in the footsteps of their ancestors, and, if it
                  had not been for their ancestors, they would probably bly have browsed on the wild
                  grass of the llanos or plains. Ah! there are a great many such bobs hanging at the
                  tail of some ancestral kite, even in this great city, my dear, learned
                  friend."</p>
               <p>"True, Doctor, you are right there."</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, the vanilla is gathered from the wild vines in the woods. Off goes the
                  hidalgo, proud of his noble ancestry, and toils home under a back-load of the
                  refuse beans from the trees, after the red monkey has had his pick of the best. A
                  few reals pay him for the day's work, and then, hey for the cock-pit! There,
                  Signor Olfogie meets the Marquis de Shinplaster, or the Padre Corcorochi, and of
                  course gets whistled out of his earnings with the first click of the gaffs. Then
                  back he goes to his miserable hammock, and so ends his year's labor. That, sir, is
                  the history of the flavoring, and you will have to allow a stretch across the
                  Caribbean, say twenty-five hundred miles, for the vanilla."</p>
               <p>"We are getting pretty well around, Doctor."</p>
               <p>"Then we have sauce, here, wine-sauce; Teneriffe, I should say, by the flavor. <q>

               <p>"Thank you, my dear young friend, thank you. The nutmeg! To the Spice Islands, in
                  the Indian Ocean we are indebted for our nutmegs. Our old original
                  Knicker-bockers, the web-footed Dutchmen, have the monopoly of this trade. Every
                  nutmeg has paid toll at the Hague before it yields its aroma to our graters. The
                  Spice Islands! The almost fabulous Moluccas, where neither corn nor rice will
                  grow; where the only quadrupeds they have are the odorous goats that breathe the
                  fragrant air, and the musky crocodiles that bathe in the high-seasoned waters. The

                  nutmeg."</p>
               <p>"This is getting to be a pretty large pudding, Doctor."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir. We have traveled already twenty-five thousand five hundred miles around
                  it, and now let us re-circumnavigate and come back by the way of Mexico, so that
                  we can get a silver spoon, and penetrate into the interior."</p>

               <head>III. The Radiant Dinner Castor.</head>
               <p>WE begin to think there is wisdom in Dr. Bushwhacker. "There are other things to
                  study geography from, besides maps and globes," is one of his favorite maxims. We
                  begin to believe it. "Observe my learned friend," said he, "how the reflected
                  sunshine from those cut bottles in the castor-stand, throws long plumes of light
                  in every direction across the white damask." We leaned forward, and saw the
                  phenomenon pointed out by the index-finger of the Doctor, and as we knew something
                  was coming from his pericranics, kept silent of course. "Well," said he, inflating
                  his lips until his face looked like that of a cast-iron caryatid, "well, my dear
                  friend, every pencil of light there is a point of the compass, and the contents of
                  that castor come from places as various as those diverging rays indicate. The
                  mustard is from England, the vinegar from France, China furnishes the soy, Italy
                  the oil, we have to ask the West Indies to contribute the red-pepper, and the East
                  Indies to supply the black-pepper." We ventured to remark that those facts we were
                  not ignorant of, by any means. "True, my dear learned friend," said the Doctor,
                  with a sort of snort; "but God bless me! if one-half of the<pb n="14-15"
                     xml:id="VAC6182-00000014"/> people in this city know it." "Mustard," continued
                  Doctor Bushwhacker, not at all discomfited, "comes from Durham, in the north of
                  England—that is, the best quality. The other productions of this county do not
                  amount to much, nor is it celebrated for any thing, except that here the Queen
                  Philippa, wife of King Edward the Third, captured David Bruce, King of Scots, for
                  which reason no Scotchman can eat Durham mustard except with tears in his eyes. We
                  get our grindstones from this English county, my learned friend; and when you
                  sharpen your knife or your appetite hereafter, it will remind you of Durham. That
                  long pencil of light from the next bottle points to France, where they make the
                  best wine-vinegar we get. Just observe the difference between that sturdy,
                  pot-bellied mustard-bottle, which represents John Bull, and this slender sharp,
                  vinegar-cruet, which represents Johnny Crapeau; there is a national distinction
                  sir, in cruets as well as men. The quantity of vinegar made in France is very
                  great, the best comes from Bordeaux; sometimes it is so strong that the Frenchmen
                  call it '<foreign xml:lang="FRA">vinaigre des trois dents,</foreign>' or vinegar
                  with three teeth; but the finest flavored vinegar I ever met with came from
                  Portugal, and for a salad, nothing could equal its delicate aroma. Well, sir, then
                  there is the red-pepper, the Cayenne; that I presume is from Jamaica?" We
                  assented.</p>
               <p>"The best and strongest kind is made partly of the bird pepper, and partly of the
                  long-pod pepper of the West Indies. This is a very healthy condiment, sir; in the
                  tropics it is indispensable; there is a maxim there, sir, that people who eat
                  Cayenne pepper will live for ever. Like variety, it is the spice of life, sir, at
                  the equator. Our own gardens, sir, furnish capsicum, and in fact it grows in all
                  parts of the world; but that from the West Indies is esteemed to be the best, and
                  I think with justice. Now, sir, the next pencil of light is reflected from the
                  Yellow Sea!"</p>
               <p>"The soy, Doctor?"</p>
               <p>"The soy, my learned friend; the best fish-sauce on the face of the globe. The
                  soy, sir, or 'soya,' as the Japanese call it, is a species of bean, which would
                  grow in this country as well as any other Chinese plant. Few Chinamen eat anything
                  without a mixture of this bean-jelly in some shape or other. They scald and peel
                  the beans, then add an equal quantity of wheat or barley, then the mess is allowed
                  to ferment, then they add a little salt, sometimes tumeric for color, water is
                  added also, in the proportion of three to one of the mass, and after a few months'
                  repose the soy is pressed, strained, and ready for market. That, sir, is the
                  history of that cruet, and now we will pass on to the black pepper."</p>
               <p>"A glass of wine first, Doctor, if you please."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, my dear friend; bless me, how dry I am."</p>
               <p>"Black pepper, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">piper nigrum,</foreign> is the berry of a
                  vine that grows in Sumatra and Ceylon, but our principal<pb n="16-17"
                     xml:id="VAC6182-00000015"/> supply of this commonest of condiments comes from
                  the Island of Java; and we have to pay our web-footed Knickerbockers, across the
                  water, a little toll upon that, as we do upon many other things of daily
                  consumption. The pepper-vine is a very beautiful plant, with large, oval, polished
                  leaves and showy white flowers, that would look beautiful if wound around the head
                  of a bride."</p>
               <p>"No doubt, Doctor, but I think the less pepper about a bride the better."</p>
               <p>"Good, my learned friend; you are right; if I were to get married again, sir,"
                  continued the Doctor in a very hearty manner, "I should be a little afraid of the
                  contact of <foreign xml:lang="LAT">piper nigrum.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"What is white pepper, Doctor?"</p>
               <p>"White pepper is the same, sir, as black pepper, only it is decorticated, that is,
                  the black husk has been rubbed off. Now, sir, there is not much else interesting
                  about pepper, except that the best probably comes from the kingdom of Bantam; and
                  the quantity, formerly exported from the seaport of that name in the Island of
                  Java, amounted, sir, to ten thousand tons annually; a good seasonable supply of
                  seasoning for the world, sir. Well, sir, we are also indebted to Bantam for a very
                  small breed of fowls, the peculiar use of which no philosopher has as yet been
                  able to determine. Now, sir, we have finished the castor, I think?"</p>
               <p>"There is one point of light, Doctor, that indicates Italy; what of the oil?"</p>
               <p>"Ah! Lucca and Parma! Indeed, sir, I may say, France, Spain, and Italy! <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>'Three kingdoms claim its birth;</l>

                     </lg>
                  </q> The olive, sir. I remember something from my school-boy days about that. It
                  is from Pliny's History of Nature, sir. (Liber. XV.) The olive in the western
                  world was the companion, sir, as well as the symbol of peace. Two centuries after
                  the foundation of Rome, both Italy and Africa were strangers to this useful plant.
                  It was naturalized in those countries, sir, and at length carried into the heart
                  of Spain and Gaul. The timid errors of the ancients, that it required a certain
                  degree of heat, and could not flourish in the neighborhood of the sea, were
                  insensibly exploded by industry and experience. There, sir! But the timid errors
                  of the ancients are not more surprising than the timid errors of the moderns. The
                  olive tree should be as common here as it is in the old world, especially as it is
                  the emblem of peace. My old friend, Dominick Lynch, sir, the wine-merchant, the
                  only <emph>great</emph> wine-merchant we ever had, sir, imported the finest oil,
                  sir, from Lucca, known even to this day as 'Lynch's Oil.' He it was who made
                  Château Margaux and the Italian opera, popular, sir, in this great metropolis.
                  Poor Dom! Well, sir, I suppose you know all about the olive tree?"</p>
               <p>"On the contrary, very little."</p>
               <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6182-00000016"/>
               <p>"Well, the olive is as easily propagated as the willow. You must go boldly to
                  work, however, and cut off a limb of the tree, as big as my arm, and plant that.
                  No twig, sir. In three years it will bear; in five years it will have a full crop;
                  in ten years it will be in perfection. If you plant a slip, it will take twenty
                  years or more to mature. Its mode of bearing is biennial, and you can prune it
                  every other year, and plant the cuttings. Longworth ought to take up the olive,
                  sir; and he might have a wreath to put around his head, as he deserves. Well, my
                  learned friend, when the olive is ripe—the fruit I mean—it is of a deep violet
                  color. Those we get in bottles are plucked while they are green. The plums are put
                  between two circular mill-stones—the upper one convex, the lower one concave; the
                  fruit is thus crushed, and afterward put into a press, and the oil is extracted by
                  means of a powerful lever. That is all, sir; an oil-press is not a very handsome
                  article to look at; but in the South, I think it would be serviceable at least;
                  butter there is not always of the best quality in summer; and olive oil would be a
                  delightful substitute.</p>
               <p>"What of French and Spanish oil, Doctor?"</p>
               <p>"Spanish oil is very good, sir. So is French; we get little of the Italian oil
                  now. The oil of Aix, near Marseilles, is of superior quality; but that does not
                  come to our market. Lately I have used the oil of Bordeaux in place of the
                  Italian; it is very fine. But speaking of olive oil, let me tell you an anecdote
                  of my friend Godey, of Philadelphia, of the <title>Ladies' Book,</title> sir, the
                  best hearted man of that name in the world. Well, sir, Godey had a new
                  servant-girl; I never knew any body that didn't have a <emph>new</emph>
                  servant-girl! Well, sir, Godey had a dinner-party in early spring, when lettuce is
                  a rarity, and of course he had lettuce. He is a capital hand at a salad, and so he
                  dressed it. The guests ate it; and—sir—well, sir, I must hasten to the end of the
                  story. Said Godey to the new girl next morning: 'What has become of that bottle of
                  castor-oil I gave you to put away yesterday morning?' 'Sure,' said she, '<emph>you
                     said it was castor-oil, and I put it in the castor.</emph>' 'Well,' said Godey,
                  'I thought so.'"</p>

               <head>IV. Chocolate and Cocoa.</head>
               <p>"HOW is it, Doctor," said we over our matutinal, but unusual cup of chocolate,
                  "how is it that drinking chocolate produces a headache with many persons who can
                  eat chocolate bon-bons by the quantity with impunity!" "My learned friend," said
                  Dr. Bushwhacker, rousing up and shaking his mane, "I will tell you all about it.
                  Chocolate, or as the great Linnæus used to call it, '<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Theo
                     broma</foreign>'—food for the gods—is a most peculiar preparation. It is made
                  of the berries of the cacao, sir, a small tree indigenous to South America. We
                  misname the berries cocoa, because the <foreign xml:lang="SPA">jicaras,</foreign>
                  or native cups in which the cocoa was drunk by the Mexicans, were made of the
                  small end of the cocoa-nut. The tree, sir, bears a beautiful rose-colored blossom,
                  and that produces a long pod, resembling our cucumber; in that pod we find the
                  cacao imbedded—a multitude of oval pits, about the size of shelled almonds, and
                  surrounded with a white acid pulp. Now, sir, this pulp produces a very refreshing
                  drink in the tropics, called <foreign xml:lang="POR">vino cacao,</foreign> or
                  cacao-wine, which is more esteemed there than the beverage we make from the
                  berries."</p>
               <p>"But, Doctor, how about the headache?'</p>
               <p>"Sir," said the Doctor, "I am getting to that. If you take a pair of compasses,
                  and put the right leg in the middle of the Madeira River, one of the tributaries
                  of the majestic Amazon, and extend the other to Caracas, then sweep it round in a
                  circle, you will embrace within that the native land of the cacao. It grows, sir,
                  from Venezuela to the Pampas of Buenos Ayres, an extent of country more beautiful,
                  vaster, and of less importance than any other territory on the habitable globe.
                  Well, sir, this plant, which, from its oleaginous properties, seems suitable to
                  supply the want of animal food, is expressly adapted for that country. 'He who has
                  drank one cup,' says Fernando Cortez, 'can travel a whole day without any other
                  food.' Now, sir, we must not believe this altogether; but the value of this liquid
                  nutriment for those who have to cross the Llanos of the north, or the Pampas of
                  the south, is not to be lightly estimated."</p>
               <p>"But the headache, Doctor?"</p>
               <p>"Chocolate," continued Dr. Bushwhacker, "is made of the cacao berries, slightly
                  roasted and triturated in water; a certain degree of heat is necessary in its
                  preparation. The best we have comes from Caracas, it is of a light brown color,
                  and quite expensive, sometimes two or three dollars a pound. The ordinary
                  chocolate we import from France, Spain, Germany, and the West Indies, is a mixture
                  of cacao with sago, rice, sugar, and other articles, flavored with cinnamon or
                  vanilla, the latter being deleterious on account of its effects upon the nervous
                     system<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6182-00000018"/> tem. How much Caracas cacao is
                  used here I do not know, but I presume Pará furnishes our manufacturers with their
                  principal supplies. The quantity of cacao that comes here in its native state is
                  very great, compared with the manufactured article, the chocolate; we import one
                  hundred and seventy thousand dollars' worth of the one, against a little over two
                  thousand dollars' worth of the other."</p>
               <p>"But the headache, Doctor? What is the reason that liquid choco——"</p>
               <p>"Sir," replied Dr. Bushwhacker, drawing himself up with cast-iron dignity, "if I
                  interrupted you as often as you interrupt me, that question would be answered some
                  time after the allies take Sebastopol. Chocolate was introduced into Spain by
                  Fernando Cortez; to this day it is in Spain what coffee is to France, or tea to
                  England, the pet beverage of all classes of people who can afford it. It was
                  introduced into England simultaneously with coffee, just before the restoration of
                  King Charles the Second. Then it was prepared for the table by merely mixing it
                  with hot water, no milk, sir. Pope alludes to it in the Rape of the Lock.

                     </lg>
                  </q> The Spaniards, sir, do not use milk in preparing it, nor do the South
                  Americans. By the way, thirty years ago, my friend, Col. Duane, of Philadelphia,
                  published a book on Colombia, which is highly interesting; so, too, you will find
                  Zea's Colombia of the same period; Pazo's Letters to Henry Clay, written in 1819;
                  Depon's Voyages in the early part of this century; and the still more interesting
                  voyages of Don George Juan, and Don Antonio de Ulloa, in 1735. Then there is
                  Hippisly's Narrative, Brown's Itinerary, and many other books, my learned friend,
                  that will tell you about the cacao. In that country, where meat is not abundant, a
                  cup of chocolate supplies the necessary nutriment, and a breakfast of cacao and
                  fruit, sir, is satisfying and delicious. Arbuthnot says it is rich, alimentary,
                  and anodyne."</p>
               <p>"But the headache, Doctor?"</p>
               <p>"In Spain," continued the Doctor, it is served up in beautiful cups of fillagree
                  work, made in the shape of tulips or lilies, with leaves that fold over the top by
                  touching a spring. These leaves are to protect it from the flies. The ladies are
                  so fond of it that they have it sent after them to church; this the bishops
                  interdicted for a while, but that only made it more desirable."</p>
               <p>"But what are its peculiar properties, Doctor?"</p>
               <p>"Tea, my learned friend," replied the Doctor, curtly, "inspires scandal and
                  sentiment; coffee excites the imagination; but chocolate, sir, is
                  aphrodisiac!"</p>

               <p>"MY dear learned friend," said Dr. Bushwhacker, putting down his half-empty goblet
                  of claret, "that is the finest wine I ever tasted. A man, sir, should go down on
                  his knees when he drinks such wine; it inspires me, sir, with humility and
                  devotion. Six months' retirement and study, with a liberal allowance of claret
                  like that would induce an epic poem, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Retirement and study would do much, Doctor; but as for the claret I have my
                  doubts. France, with all her clarets, has no great poet."</p>

               <p>"My dear learned friend, it is," replied the Doctor, emptying his goblet, and
                  giving a triumphant snort, "and for poetry, too."</p>
               <p>"How is it, then, that with all her great poets, France has not produced a great

               <p>"No, sir."</p>
               <p>"Then I would advise you to read it, sir."</p>
               <p>"My learned friend," continued Dr. Bushwhacker, after an impressive pause, "I have
                  a theory that certain wines produce certain effects upon the mind. I believe, sir,
                  that if I were to come in upon a dinner-party about the time when conversation had
                  become luminous and choral, I could easily tell whether Claret, Champagne, Sherry,
                  Madeira, Burgundy, Port, or Punch, had been the prevailing potable. Yes, sir, and
                  no doubt a skillful critic could determine, after a careful analysis of the
                  subject, upon what drink, sir, a poem was written. Yes, sir, or tell a claret
                  couplet from a sherry couplet, sir, or distinguish<pb n="26-27"

                  Madeira in another, from internal evidence, sir."</p>
               <p>"Suppose, Doctor, the poet were a water-drinker?"</p>
               <p>"My dear learned friend," replied the Doctor vehemently, "if you can find in the
                  whole range of literature—and I will go farther than that—if you can find in the
                  whole range of intelligence, either poet, statesman, orator, artist, hero, or
                  divine, who was a water-drinker, and worth one (excuse me) curse! then, sir, I
                  will renounce the practice of my profession, and occupy my time in a water-cure
                  establishment. On the contrary, look at the <emph>illustrious writers</emph> of
                  all ages and nations, sir; look at Homer. There is no end to the juncketings in
                  the Iliad, sir; and the Greek heaven, sir, is pretty well supplied with every
                  thing else but water, I believe. <q>

                  believe both, sir. From the island of Chios came the first wine and the first
                  epic, sir; hand in hand they came into the world, and hand in hand they will go

                  perished with the Roman Empire, I have my doubts whether Dante, Pulci, Tasso,

                  sitting upright and holding his head like a poised avalanche, "by speaking of
                  Cervantes, sir, you have put a keystone into the arch of my theory, sir. The
                  Elizabethan era should be called the age of Sack, sir. Look at those two great
                  writers, Shakspeare and Cervantes, each a transcendant genius, sir; both living at
                  the same time, sir; both dying on the same day, sir—on the 23d of April,
                  1616."</p>

                  the first human principle I would teach them should be, to forswear thin
                  potations, and to addict themselves to Sack.' Shakspeare, sir! King Henry Fourth,
                  part second, act fourth, scene third, sir!"</p>
               <p>"How long did this golden age of Sack continue, Doctor?"</p>
               <p>"Until Charles the Second returned from France, and brought Claret into fashion.
                  You can see the light, delicate, fanciful potable, sir, in the literature of this
                  period as plain as sunlight. Next came the age of Port, sir, in Queen Anne's
                  reign."</p>
               <p>"Ah! I remember, the Methuen treaty."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, the treaty of 1703. Port was encouraged by low duties, and lighter and
                  better wines of other countries interdicted by enormous imposts, and in
                  consequence we have a new school of literature, sir. The imaginative, the nervous,
                  the pathetic, the humorous, and the sublime departed with the age of Sack; the
                  gay, the witty, the amorous, and the fanciful, with the age of Claret; and the
                  artificial, the critical, the satirical, and the commonplace arose, sir, with the
                  age of Port! But bless my heart," said Doctor Bushwhacker, rising and looking at
                  his watch, "I must look after my patients. The next time we meet we will have a
                  talk over modern wines and authors, and that will be more interesting, I dare

                  <p>"The prohibition of wine, sir," replied the Doctor, solemnly, "led to the
                     substitution of spirits. You see how Hogarth, in his immortal pictures, shows
                     its progress in Gin Lane. Well, sir, if you wish to see how intimate are the
                     relations between drinking and thinking, mark the host of clever literary
                     vagabonds of this period. Genius in rags, sir; genius with immortal thoughts in
                     his brain and no crown to his hat; Pegassus, with every thing but his wings, in
                     the pawnbroker's shop. The long exhausting toil of literary occupation, which
                     needs a <emph>natural</emph> stimulant, such as wine, (for men of sedentary
                     habits must have it, sir,) was relieved by stronger stimulants, because they
                     were cheaper. And now, sir, mark the two great geniuses of the middle of the
                     last century, Fielding and Smollett; see the wonderful power of those writers,
                     and observe the characteristic coarseness of their works, and what else is
                     there to say 'to point a moral,' farther, than that Smollett, with a shattered
                     constitution, went to Leghorn, to die there; and Fielding, with a shattered
                     constitution, went to Lisbon, to die there. Fielding, at the age of 47, and
                     Smollett at the age of 50, sir."</p>
                  <p>"What would you infer from that, Doctor?"</p>
                  <p>"Sir," replied the Doctor, "I leave you to draw the inference. Now, sir, we
                     come to another epoch. A period, sir, of great mental brilliancy, and I wish
                     you to observe that fine wine drinking had again become fashionable ionable.
                     Claret was monstrously expensive, but claret was the mode. Now, sir, we have
                     Fox, and Pitt, and Sheridan, and Burke, and Chesterfield, and Garrick, and Sir
                     Joshua Reynolds, and Goldsmith. And among this brilliant cluster there stands
                     out conspicuous a remarkable figure. Not that he was greater than these, not
                     that his genius was superior, nor his wisdom more profound, yet still the most
                     conspicuous figure in the group was——"</p>
                  <p>"Dr. Samuel Johnson."</p>
                  <p>"Dr. Jamuel Johnson," echoed Dr. Bushwhacker."Did you ever know, sir, leaving
                     out a few of our prominent hydrophobists, a man so eminent for invective,
                     asperity, bitterness, insolence, dogmatic assumption, and gluttony, as the Ursa
                     Major of English literature? And, sir, he was a total abstinent. To use his own
                     words: 'I now no more think of drinking wine than a horse does. The wine upon
                     the table is no more for me than for the dog who is under the table.' But he
                     could drink, sir, twenty-three cups of tea at poor Mrs. Thrale's table at a
                     sitting, until four o'clock in the morning, sir, which may be set down as a
                     fair sample of teetotal debauchery, my learned friend."</p>
                  <p>"Dr. Johnson was a very good hearted man, I believe."</p>

                     attachment to his friends, his love of the poor, his rigid honesty, his piety,
                     and his filial affection, were wonderful, sir, We all love <emph>this</emph>

                     also another character; an irritable, uncouth, imperious, ill-tempered,
                     gluttonous, rude, prejudiced, intolerant, violent, unsparing old cynic; and
                        <emph>this</emph> Samuel Johnson we do not love. Sir, human nature has
                     scarcely formed a character so disproportionate. He was a great man, sir, and a

                     him up slightly in the little yard back of the house. Charles was talking in
                     his phosphroresent way over the negus, when Mary interrupted him:</p>
                  <p>Charles, that dog yelps so.' Elia flashed on. 'Charles, that dog—' 'What i-i-is
                     it, Mary? Oh! the dog? He-he-he-he's enjoying him-s-s-self.' 'Enjoying himself,
                     Charles?' 'Ye-ye-yes—as well as he can with 'whine and water.'"</p>
                  <p>"Capital story, Doctor. What of the Laureate?"</p>
                  <p>"In reading, Southey," replied Doctor Bushwhacker, "you feel the want of the
                     rare old vinous smack peculiar to the writings of authors of eminence, sir. I
                     may say the same, too, of Wordsworth. Both were tolerably abstinent; but
                     Southey had his wine-cellar at Greta Hall, and Wordsworth, in celebrating his
                     first visit to the rooms once occupied by Milton at Christ College, was a
                     little overcome, sir, by—a—<emph>his visit, sir.</emph> Southey, in his
                     personal character, manners, and habits, must have resembled our dear Henry
                     Inman, sir."</p>
                  <p>"And Hazlitt?"</p>
                  <p>"Misanthropic, cynical, Hazlitt, sir, used to drink black tea, sir, of the
                     intensest strength. He is another illustration of my theory, sir."</p>
                  <p>"And Keats?"</p>
                  <p>"Read Keats over, my learned friend; and if you can unlatch the tendrils of the
                     vine from any of his super-exquisite poems, great or small, then sir, I will
                     bury my lancet. What a delicate taste for wine he must have had!"</p>
                  <p>"And Shelley, Doctor?"</p>
                  <p>"My dear friend," said the Doctor, rising, and upsetting his tumbler, "Shelley
                     never understood the human aspect of existence. I fear me he was not a
                     wine-drinker. Suppose we say, or admit he was a solitary exception?"</p>

                     in the songs as they are in the river. 'O! the pride of the German heart is
                     this noble River! and right it is; for of the rivers of this beautiful earth,
                     there is none so beautiful as this. There is hardly a league of its whole
                     course, from its cradle in the snowy Alps to its grave in the sands of Holland,
                     which boasts not its peculiar charms. By<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6182-00000026"

                     clustering grapes that hang about its temples, as it reels onwards through
                     vineyards in a triumphal march, like Bacchus, crowned and drunken.' There, sir,
                     what do you think of that?"</p>
                  <p>"Grand, Doctor, like the triumphant chanting of an organ. Who wrote it?"</p>
                  <p>"Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, sir! Hyperion, sir, Read it over, and get it by

                  <p>"The German writers all use the wines of Fatherland, Doctor."</p>
                  <p>"Nearly all, from Martin Luther down. I say nearly all—Goethe was an exception.
                     The courtly Goethe used to drink the fine Burgundies and Bordeaux of France.
                     But Schiller, sir, was a Rhine-wine drinker. In fact his writing-table was
                     always supplied with the golden potable of the Rhine. Now, sir, we see between
                     these two men of eminent genius, two separate and distinguishing
                     characteristics. Goethe was different from all other German poets—but Schiller
                     was above all other German poets, including Goethe himself."</p>

               <head>VI. A Peep into a Salad-Bowl.</head>
               <p>"MY dear, learned friend," said the Doctor, "a Bowl of Lettuce is the Venus of the
                  dinner table! It rises upon the sight cool, moist and beautiful, like that very
                  imprudent lady coming out of the sea, sir! And to complete the image, sir, neither
                  should be dressed too much!"</p>
               <p>When Dr. Bushwhacker had issued this observation, he drew himself up in a very
                  portly manner, as if he felt called upon to defend himself as well as his image.
                  Then, after a short pause, he broke—silence.</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Lactuca,</foreign> or lettuce, is one of the most common
                  vegetables in the world; it has been known, sir, from time immemorial; it was as
                  common, sir, on the tables of the ancients as it is now, and was eaten in the same
                  way, sir, dressed with oil and vinegar. We get, sir, from Athenæus some idea of
                  the condiments used; not all of these contributed to make a salad, but it shows
                  they had the materials: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>'Dried grapes, and salt, and eke new wine</l>

                        <l>And sumach, honey, and majorum,</l>

                        <l>And herbs, and vinegar, and oil,</l>
                        <l>And sauce of onions, mustard and capers mixed,</l>
                        <l>And parsley, capers too, and eggs,</l>
                        <l>And lime, and cardimums, and th' acid juice</l>
                        <l>Which comes from the green fig-tree; besides lard,</l>
                        <l>And eggs and honey, and flour wrapped in fig-leaves,</l>
                        <l>And all compounded in one savory force-meat.'</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> They had pepper too. Ophelian says: <q>
                     <l>'Pepper from Lybya take, and frankincense.'</l>
                  </q> So, sir, if you had dined with Alcibiades, no doubt he would have dressed a
                  salad for you with Samian oil, and Sphettian vinegar, sir, pepper from Lybia, and
                  salt from—ah—hm—"</p>
               <p>"Attica, doctor."</p>
               <p>"Attica, my learned friend; thank you. Now, sir, there was one thing the ancients
                  did with lettuce which we do not do. They boiled it, sir, and served it up like
                  asparagus; so, too, did they with cucumbers—a couple of indigestible dishes they
                  were, no doubt. Lettuce, my dear friend, should have a quick growth, in the first
                  place, to be good; it should have a rich mould, sir, that it may spring up
                  quickly, so as to be tender and crisp. Then, sir, it should be
                     <emph>new-plucked,</emph> carried from the garden a few minutes before it is
                  placed upon the table. I would suggest a parasol, sir, to keep the leaves cool
                  until it reaches the shadow of within-doors. Then, sir, it must be washed—mind
                  you—ice-water! Then place it upon the table—what Corinthian ornament more perfect
                  and symmetrical. Now, sir, comes the important part, the DRESSING. 'To dress a
                  salad,' says the learned Petrus Petronius, 'you must have a prodigal to furnish
                  the oil, a counselor to dispense the salt, a miser to dole out the vinegar, and a
                  madman to stir it.' Commit that to memory, my learned friend."</p>
               <p>"It is down, Doctor." (<hi rend="i"/>Tablets.)</p>
               <p>"Let me show you," continued Dr. Bushwhacker, "how to dress a salad. Take a small
                  spoonful of salt, thus: twice the quantity of mustard—'Durham'—thus: incorporate:
                  pour a slender stream of oil from the cruet, so: gently mix and increase the
                  action by degrees," (head of hair in commotion, and face brilliant in color;)
                  "dear me! it is very warm—now, sir, oil in abundance, so; a dash of vinegar, very
                  light, like the last touches of the artist; and, sir, we have the dressing. Now,
                  take up the lettuce by the stalk! Break off the leaves—leaf by leaf—shake off the
                  water, replace it in the salad-bowl, pepper it slightly, pour on the dressing, and
                  there you have it, sir."</p>
               <p>"Doctor, is that orthodox?"</p>
               <p>"Sir," replied Dr. Bushwhacker, holding the boxwood spoon in one hand and the
                  box-wood fork in the other; "the eyes of thirty centuries are looking down upon
                  me. I know that Frenchmen will sprinkle the lettuce with oil until it is thorougly
                  saturated; then, sir, a little pepper; then, sir, salt or not, as it happens;
                  then, sir, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">vinaigre</foreign> by the drop—all very well.
                  Our people, sir, in the State of New Jersey, will dress it with salt, vinegar, and

                  friend, the Rev. Sidney Smith, sir, gives us a recipe in verse, that shows how
                  they do it there, and at the same time, exhibits the deplorable ignorance of that

               <p>We replied, the fact was not to be disputed.</p>
               <p>"Old fashioned people, sir; old fashioned in dress, in speech, in politeness, in
                  ideas, in every thing. And, sir, not long since, I had occasion to visit two old
                  ladies, sir; I went down stairs to the basement dining room, sir, without
                  ceremony, sir, and there I found the antiquated virgins over their coffee, sir;
                  and in the middle of the table there was the old fashioned tin coffee pot, sir,
                  scoured as bright as sand could make it, with a great big superannuated spout, and
                  a great broad backed handle, sir, and a great big, broad bottom, sir, as broad,
                  sir, as<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6182-00000029"/> the top of the great bell crowned
                  hat I used to wear when I went to visit them as a spruce young buck, in the year
                  eighteen hundred and twenty, sir." Here the Doctor's spectacles fairly glistened
                  again.</p>
               <p>"Well, Doctor?"</p>
               <p>"Sir," replied Dr. Bushwhacker, "there was plenty of silver in the cupboard,
                  plenty; great pots, and coffee urns of solid metal, sir, with massive handles to
                  match; but they were so old fashioned as to prefer the old, scoured, broad
                  bottomed tin pot, sir, and with reason, too, sir."</p>
               <p>"Give us the reason, thereof, Doctor, if you please."</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, one of the sisters apologized for the coffee pot in a still, small
                  sort of a voice, a little cracked and chipped by constant use, and said, the
                  reason why they drank their coffee out of that pot was <emph>because it never
                     seemed to taste so well out of any thing else.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Why not, Doctor?"</p>
               <p>"Why not? Easily enough explained, sir; we never <emph>make</emph> coffee in a
                  silver urn, and when we pour it from the vessel in which it is made into another,
                  we lose half the aroma, sir. Coffee is of most delicate and choice flavor, sir;
                  very few know how to make it or to use it. The proper way to make good coffee,
                  sir, is to roast it carefully in a cylinder over a charcoal fire, until it is of a
                  light brown color; then the cylinder should be taken off the fire and turned
                  gently until the berries are thoroughly cooled. The best part of the aroma is
                  dissipated, sir, by the abominable practice of turning out the coffee in an open
                  dish so soon as it is roasted. Why, sir, any body can see that the finest part of
                  it escapes; you can smell it, sir, in every crack and corner of the house. When
                  cooled, it should be put into a mortar and beat to powder. A coffee mill only
                  cracks the grains, but a mortar pounds out the essential oil. Then, sir, put it
                  into an old fashioned tin coffee pot, pour on the hot water, stand it over a fire,
                  not too hot; let it simmer <emph>gently.</emph> If your fire is too hot, it will
                  burn the coffee and spoil it. Then, sir, take Madam Follett fresh from the fire,
                  stand her on the table, and if you want an appreciative friend, send for me!"</p>
               <p>"What kind of coffee is the best, Doctor?"</p>
               <p>"Mocha, sir, from Arabia Felix. The first Mocha coffee that ever reached the Land
                  of the Free and the Home of the Brave direct, sir, came in a ship belonging to
                  Captain Derby, of Salem, in the year 1801."</p>
               <p>"When was coffee first used in Europe, Doctor?"</p>
               <p>"That, my learned friend, is one of 'the two or three things to suggest
                  conversation at the tea table,' as our friend Willis has it. It is a matter of
                  dispute, my learned friend, and it will probably be settled after the commentators
                  have agreed upon the proper way of spelling the name of Shakspeare, Shaksper,
                  Shagsper, or whatever you call him."</p>
               <p>"How early was coffee in use in the world?"</p>
               <p>"Sherbaddin, an Arab author, asserts that the first man who drank coffee was a
                  certain Mufti, of Aden, who<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6182-00000030"/> lived in the
                  ninth century of the Hegira, about the year 1500, my learned friend. So says Dr.
                  Doran. The popular tradition is, that the superior of a Dervish community,
                  observing the effects of coffee berries, when eaten by some goats, rendering them
                  more lively and skittish than before, prescribed it for the brotherhood, in order
                  to cure them of drowsiness and indolence. Dickens, in <title>Household
                     Words,</title> gives a capital account of the old coffee houses of London. By
                  the way, there is an account, also, in <title>Table Traits.</title> Here is the
                  book. <cit>

                  <p>'The coffee houses of England take precedence of those of France, though the
                     latter have more enduringly flourished. In 1652, a Greek, in the service of an
                     English Turkey merchant, opened a house in London. 'I have discovered his hand
                     bill,' says Mr. Disraeli, 'in which he sets forth the virtue of the coffee
                     drink, first publiquely made and sold in England, by Pasqua Rosee, of St.
                     Michael's Alley, Cornhill, at the sign of his own head.' Mr. Peter Cunningham
                     cites a MS. of Oldys' in his possession, in which some fuller details of much
                     interest are given. Oldys says: 'The first use of coffee in England was known
                     in 1657, when Mr. Daniel Edwards, a Turkey merchant, brought from Smyrna to
                     London one Pasqua Rosee, a Ragusan youth, who prepared this drink for him every
                     morning. But the novelty thereof drawing too much company to him, he allowed
                     his said servant, with another of his son-in-law's, to sell it publicly; and
                     they set up the first coffee house in London, in St. Michael's Alley, Cornhill.
                     But they separating, Pasqua kept in the house; and he who had been his partner
                     obtained leave to pitch a tent, and sell the liquor, in St. Michael's church
                     yard.' Aubrey, in his <title>Anecdotes,</title> states that the first vender of
                     coffee in London was one Bowman, coachman to a Turkey merchant, named Hodges,
                     who was the father-in-law of Edwards, and the partner of Pasqua, who got into
                     difficulties, partly by his not being a freeman, and who left the country.
                     Bowman was not only patronized, but a magnificent contribution of one thousand
                     sixpences was presented to him, where with he made great improvements in his
                     coffee house. Bowman took an apprentice, (Paynter,) who soon learnt the
                     mystery, and in four years set up for himself. The coffee houses soon became
                     numerous; the principal were Farres', the Rainbow, at the Inner Temple Gate,
                     and John's, in Fuller's Rents.'</p>

               <head>VIII. Old Phrases.</head>
               <p>"FOR my part," said the Doctor, "I do not see how we could get along without them.
                  The old phrases, the idioms, the apothegms of a people are the gold and silver
                  coins of their language, bearing a proportionate value, as many hundred times, to
                  the common stock of words, as these do to the copper currency. Sir, if you will
                  get the 'Lessons on Proverbs,' by Richard Chenevix Trench, you will find you have
                  a sub-treasury of wisdom, my learned friend."</p>
               <p>"Do you not think, Doctor, there is a coarseness in familiar proverbs that
                  diminishes their value in polite society?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir, I do not think so," replied the Doctor vehemently. "To be sure, there
                  may be, here and there one in which an allusion might offend a sensitive mind;
                  but, generally speaking, they are rather robust, instead of coarse, strong without
                  being indelicate. Cervantes felicitously calls them '<foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >Sentencias brevas sacadas de la luenga y discreta experiencia</foreign>'—short
                  sentences drawn from long and wise experience. Common enough are they among
                  uneducated people, but not the less valuable for that reason, sir; proverbs may be
                  called the <emph>literature of the illiterate</emph>—another mouthful of the Mumm,
                  sir—thank you."</p>
               <p>"How do you like that wine, Doctor?"</p>
               <p>"Grand, sir; glorious, sir; 'Mumm's the word,' sir. If Shakspeare were living,
                  sir, he would forswear sack, and say '<emph>Mumm</emph>'—'a jewel of a wine,
                  sir—Jewel Mumm."</p>
               <p>"The phrase you have just used, Doctor, is a common one."</p>
               <p>"'Mumm's the word?' True, my learned friend. Dr. Johnson, that stupendous
                  lexicographer, remarks of the word mumm, it may be observed that when it is
                  pronounced it leaves the lips closed, thus," (lips in sculptured silence.)</p>
               <p>"How did the phrase originate, Doctor?"</p>
               <p>"That, sir, is a question I can not answer. There are phrases, sir, beyond the
                  scope of records, written or printed, so old, sir, that, to use the words of our
                  friend Blackstone, 'the memory of man runneth not to the contrary'—they were
                     <emph>always</emph> in use. Others we can trace at once to their originals;
                  such as, 'How we apples swim,' to a fable in Æsop; or, 'To see ourselves as others
                  see us,' to a poem of Burns; there are legions of phrases from the Bible, not one
                  of which inculcates a sentiment not divine in its humanity; there are scores from
                  Shakspeare, scores from Pope, scores from Young, some from<pb n="50-51"
                     xml:id="VAC6182-00000032"/> Byron, from Milton, Cowper, Thomson, Campbell,
                  Goldsmith, Spenser, Addison, Congreve, Prior, Sir Philip Sidney, Gray, Collins,
                  Cowley, our own poets, sir—and Daniel Webster, sir, Halleck and Irving."</p>
               <p>"There is no fear of a language, Doctor, in which such coin is current."</p>
               <p>"No, sir; nor of a people! But there are other phrases which, to the undisciplined
                  ear, seem coarse and vulgar, yet involving a story clever enough in itself to be
                  preserved."</p>
               <p>"For instance?"</p>
               <p>"For instance, 'The gray mare is the better horse.' We know very well the line is
                  in Prior's Epilogue to Lucius; but the story from which the phrase is derived is
                  something like this: A gentleman, who had seen the world, one day gave his eldest
                  son a span of horses, a chariot, and a basket of eggs. 'Do you,' said he to the
                  boy, 'travel upon the high road until you come to the first house in which there
                  is a married couple. If you find the husband is the master there, give him one of
                  the horses. If, on the contrary, the wife is the ruler, give her an egg. Return at
                  once if you part with a horse, but do not come back so long as you keep both
                  horses, and there is an egg remaining.' Away went the boy full of his mission, and
                  just beyond the borders of his father's estate lo! a modest cottage. He alighted
                  from the chariot and knocked at the door. The good wife opened it for him and
                  curtesied. 'Is your husband at home?' 'No;' but she would call him from the hay
                  field. In he came, wiping his brows. The young man told them his errand. 'Why,'
                  said the wife, bridling and rolling the corner of her apron, 'I always do as John
                  wants me to do; he is my master—an't you, John?' To which John replied, 'Yes.'
                  'Then,' said the boy, 'I am to give you a horse; which will you take?' 'I think,'
                  said John, 'as how that bay gelding seems to be the one as would suit me the
                  best.' 'If we have a <emph>choice,</emph> husband,' said the wife, '<emph>I</emph>
                  think the gray mare will suit us better.' 'No,' replied John, 'the bay for me; he
                  is more square in front, and his legs are better.' 'Now,' said the wife, 'I don't
                  think so; the gray mare is the better horse; and I shall never be contented unless
                  I get that one.' 'Well,' said John, 'if your mind is sot on it, I'll give up;
                  we'll take the gray mare.' 'Thank you,' said the boy; 'allow me to give you an egg
                  from this basket; it is a nice fresh one, and you can boil it hard or soft as your
                  wife will permit.' The rest of the story you may imagine; the young man came home
                  with both horses, but not an egg remained in his basket."</p>
               <p>"That is a scandalous story, Doctor."</p>
               <p>"True, my learned friend; but after we finish this Mumm, I will tell you another
                  with a better moral."</p>

                  <head>Old Phrases Continued.</head>
                  <p>"Let us," said the Doctor, "take up the familiar, every day language—the
                     language, sir, not of the drawing room, but of the street—the language, not of
                     the beau, but of the b'hoy, sir, and dissect it." Here the Doctor rolled up his
                     wristbands, and armed himself with a fruit-knife, in the most formidable
                     manner. "Let us," he continued, tapping the ringing rim of the finger-bowl,
                     "dissect it, sir, and expose its muscles, ligaments, and tendons, its veins and
                     its arteries, its viscera, its nerves and its ganglionic system, and sir, we
                     will find that these old phrases are the very bones of the system, sir, the
                     framework that sustains and supports all the rest. Yes, my learned friend, take
                     even a tissue of slang, and you will find it full of marrow-bones!"</p>
                  <p>"Among some people the range of ideas being limited——"</p>
                  <p>"The range of ideas being limited," interrupted the Doctor, "the range of
                     expression is necessarily limited also. Yet, you will see how readily, even
                     with a small stock of words, the b'hoys make themselves understood. One word
                     passes muster for many, by dint of inflection and gesture: a single phrase sir,
                     will often convey as many separate and opposite meanings, as a single string on
                     Ole Bull's violin will express separate and opposite sentiments. Why, sir, the
                     slang phrase, 'that's so,' is used to signify affirmation, confirmation, doubt,
                     interrogation, irony, triumph, and despair; and a host besides of shades of
                     sense relative to the subject in hand. 'You'd better believe it,' is sometimes
                     a taunt, or a menace, as the case may be; sometimes a grave and weighty piece
                     of advice; and sometimes significant of its own opposite—that is, 'You had
                     better <emph>not</emph> believe it.' Now my learned friend, if we could only
                     trace these phrases, and betimes we will, we would find them to be, not the
                     property of this generation, but the original expressions of a people very much
                     fore-shortened in language, some centuries behind the curtain of Shakspeare; or
                     else the result, the quotient, of some old story, from which every thing else
                     had been subtracted."</p>
                  <p>"Doctor, pardon me for interrupting you."</p>
                  <p>"Willis," continued the Doctor, "did originate some phrases, sir, such as 'the
                     upper ten thousand.' You see how it has been trimmed down to 'the upper ten,'
                     and by and by it will be used to signify a class simply, without any reference
                     to its previous purport. And in this connection the facile terminal
                        '<emph>dom,</emph>' which so often has brought up the rear-guard of a
                     sentence in the papers, is due to Willis, who struck it out in 'japonicadom'—a
                     most happy and felicitous phrase."</p>
                  <p>"Doctor, I would like——"</p>

                  <p>"Whether you can tell me what was the origin of the phrase—'a fish story?,"</p>
                  <p>"Certainly," responded Dr. Bushwhacker; "everybody knows that: An old Indian,
                     who had been converted by the missionaries, got along very well as far as
                     "Jonah and the whale,' where he faltered a little, but finally passed over
                     that, and went on. At last he reached the history of Shadrach, Meshech, and
                     Abednego, in the fiery furnace. 'Me no believe that,' said the Indian. 'But you
                     must believe it,' said the missionaries. The Indian dissented; but the
                     missionaries cleved to the point of faith at issue. At last, after a prolonged
                     debate, in which the Indian distinguished himself by a display of natural
                     eloquence, the old aboriginal wound up the string by saying, 'Now, I tell you,
                     me no believe that; and since you make me mad, me no believe too <emph>that
                        fish story!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"That is the origin of the phrase, sir, and it is not only original but
                     aboriginal."</p>

               <p>"MY learned friend," said the Doctor, glaring at us through his critical specs, "I
                  have seen both exhibitions, the British and the French. I was delighted sir,
                  delighted with the French exhibition. The people of France, sir, are essentially
                  an aesthetic people; they strive to please you sir, and they succeed in pleasing
                  you; they rarely widen their callipers beyond the limits of decorum; they kill
                  their tragedy heroes in abattoirs behind the scenes, and never venture to intrude
                  upon us those coarser emotions which are independent of taste and politeness; so,
                  sir, I visited the French exhibition with pleasure, and came away gratified. I do
                  not remember any single pictures except those of Rosa Bonheur, and they struck me,
                  perhaps, because they reminded me of something I had seen in nature that was
                  familiar; but otherwise, I have only a general impression, sir, of pleasure, of
                  great pleasure. It was far different, sir, with the British exhibition. I was not
                  pleased with it, sir, not pleased with it. I came away, sir, with my emotions
                  excited, and in a state of disagreement. You know my love of Shakspeare, sir!
                  well, sir, I never felt such divine pity<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6182-00000035"/>
                  for King Lear—such exquisite sympathy for Juliet (out of the book,) as I felt when
                  I saw those pictures of F. Madox Brown, and Frederick Leighton. As for the bulk of
                  the rest, the modern school of British Art, it is expressed forcibly in a line, so
                  contemptuous, sir, that from my love of the æsthetic and the agreeable, I am
                  almost afraid to quote it. But, sir, as an arbiter of matters of taste, I cannot
                  refrain from saying of the modern school of British Art: that— <q>
                     <l>'<emph>Extreme exactness is the sublime of fools,</emph>'</l>
                  </q> and, sir, you may try the measure by the spots on the sailor boy's breeches,
                  or the twigs on any one of the pre Raphaelite trees, and if you are not convinced
                  of the truth of the above maxim, then try it on Ruskin's own picture, 'Study of a
                  block of Gneiss, <hi rend="i"/>Valley of Chamouni, Switzerland, No. 155.' Ruskin,
                  sir, is a great writer, a great rhetorician; his persuasive powers are wonderful,
                  dazzling, <emph>but not reliable, sir.</emph> Put a pen in his hand and Ruskin can
                  make his mark. Put a pallet on his thumb, and Ruskin sinks into the lowest depths
                  of Ruskinism."</p>
               <p>"My dear Doctor!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, into the lowest depths of Ruskinism. His tre-foil, cinque-foil windows
                  are very nice things in print, and we admire them; as well as his lichens, mosses,
                  striæ, and the oxide stains of his wonderful gneiss boulders; but, sir, what is
                  the use of having Ruskin's meagre representation of a lichen covered, metallic
                  stained boulder from an obscure corner of the globe, in our parlor, when we can
                  have the real article from the richest mineral kingdom on earth, just by rolling
                  it in?"</p>
               <p>"But there is the sentiment, Doctor."</p>
               <p>"The sentiment? My learned friend, if there is no sentiment in the original, what
                  can you look for in the mere copy?"</p>
               <p>"But, Doctor, what do you think of Holman Hunt's Light of the World?"</p>
               <p>"An exquisite bit of art, a happy adaptation of the school to a <emph>single
                     figure;</emph> lucky was it for him that he had no other figures in the
                  background."</p>
               <p>"Why, Doctor?"</p>
               <p>"Because the school has no idea of atmosphere, sir—atmosphere, distance,
                  perspective! Look at the background figures in his picture of St. Agnes' Eve; the
                  features, the expression of every face, painted as elaborately as if they were in
                  the foreground. Is that the way nature exhibits her panorama? Sir, so far from
                  features, or the expression of features, being recognizable at that distance, I
                  can tell you that it would be difficult to say whether there were men or women,
                  yes, bipeds or quadrupeds in that perspective."</p>
               <p>"Nevertheless, Doctor, you must admit that they are very beautiful works of art.
                  Just think of the man who can paint such pictures. Is he not very much elevated by
                  genius above his fellows?"</p>
               <p>"Unquestionably he is, and when all that is now<pb n="58-59"
                     xml:id="VAC6182-00000036"/> claimed for him has passed through the ordeal of
                  detraction, the pre-Raphaelite, or post-Raphaelite painter, will find a proper
                  niche, when all the symbols of his art are, to quote Shakspeare: <q>
                     <l>'In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.'</l>
                  </q> And, by the way, why not have a pre-Shakspearean school! Why not!"</p>
               <p>"Doctor, that is a capital idea."</p>
               <p>"My learned and dear friend, I was only in jest. A school! My dear friend, you
                  have never yet, and never will see a <emph>school</emph> of great men. Intellect
                  of the first class is great—independent—single—alone! It has no scholastic limits,
                  no pedantry, no peers. The moment art ceases to appeal to sympathies and emotions,
                  and contents itself with the bare representation of forms, it comes in competition
                  with the photograph, and at once is beaten by the more elaborate delineation of
                  the camera."</p>
               <p>"But, Doctor, you forget the symbols of the pre-Raphaelite school!"</p>
               <p>"Symbols, symbols! and of a school? What! has this age of intelligence to be
                  instructed by symbols of a school of painters? If they are able to convey ideas by
                  symbols, why do they write the names of their pictures in Saxon characters on the
                  frames? Why not let the symbols explain the symbols? <emph>They</emph> teach us
                  what art is, by symbols! Faugh! If that is high art, let me begin with the
                  rudiments, and study it out—from the alphabet of a Chinese teacup."</p>

               <head>X. Accidental Resemblances.</head>
               <p>DR. Bushwhacker came to us, to-day, in an old fashioned, full circle blue Spanish
                  cloak, a fur cap, a carpet bag, and a small package of pemmican in his hand. He
                  deposited these articles in the hall, shook the hand of my wife impressively, and
                  caressed the children with warmth and tenderness. The Doctor is usually boisterous
                  with children, but to-day he was subdued. Moreover, he gave each of them a
                  keep-sake. To Bessy a stalactite from the grotto of Antiparos; to Lucy a little
                  paper of sand from the Desert of Sahara; Tom had a vial of water from the pool of
                  Bethesda; and Jack a twig of ivy from Melrose Abbey. Even the baby was not
                  forgotten, for he had brought it a Chinese rattle, that no doubt was contemporary
                  with the age of Confucius; and to my wife he presented a little book made of
                  papyrus, inscribed with Coptic characters, which might have been decyphered had
                  they not been obliterated by time. Then, putting his hand in his left vest pocket,
                  he drew forth a present for me. It was his lancet, which, he assured me, had bled
                  more respectable people than any other lancet in fashionable practice. "My learned
                  friend," said he, "you have no idea of the fees which<pb n="60-61"
                     xml:id="VAC6182-00000037"/> have accumulated upon the point of this instrument.
                  But the old practice, sir, the old, venerable, respectable practice is vanishing
                  in these new fangled, latter-day lights of science. The good old days of calomel
                  and tartar emetic have departed. The late Surgeon General broke down the
                  time-consecrated faith in these specifics, and now, sir, we have to study the
                  physical idiosyncracies of a patient before we prescribe, as diligently as lawyers
                  do when working up a case in their profession. The good old easy days are gone,
                  sir—but I hear the dinner bell!"</p>
               <p>The Doctor was silent during the repast. But a bottle of "Old Wanderer, 1822," as
                  bright as a topaz, drew him out. Poising the straw stem glass between his thumb
                  and forefinger, and viewing the shining fluid with the eye of a connoisseur, he
                  broke forth—"My learned friend, do you suppose that the science of chemistry has
                  advanced so far that this wine could be imitated even by a Liebig?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly not Doctor. To any person of fine taste, all imitations must pass for
                  imitations. They no more resemble the original than——"</p>
               <p>"Imitations usually do. I know what you want to say, my learned friend. All
                  plagiarisms are as inferior to originals, as copies of great pictures, or plaster
                  casts of great sculptures, are inferior to the works which the pencil or the
                  chisel, in the hands of a great master of his art, has accomplished. This is so
                  well understood in the mere sensuous works of painters and sculptors that even the
                  most accurate copy of a Raphael, or of a Leonardi di Vinci, is nothing worth
                  comparing with the original. But how is it with literature, my learned
                  friend?"</p>
               <p>"I do not understand you, Doctor."</p>
               <p>"How is it with literature? Do you think that you can ever build up an American
                  literature, if the chief merit of our native authors exists only by imitation? Dr.
                  Drake, sir, Joseph Rodman Drake was an example. He was an original native poet,
                  sir. Who has followed his example? Not one."</p>
               <p>"That would be imitation Doctor."</p>
               <p>"No, sir. It would be <emph>emulation.</emph> There is a nice distinction between
                  the two phrases."</p>
               <p>"But what do you mean by plagiarisms Doctor?"</p>
               <p>"That is rather a harsh term to use. Suppose we call them 'accidental
                  resemblances.' Now, your friend, Barry Gray, paid you a great compliment in
                  accidentally resembling your style. My dear old friend, Washington Irving, once
                  said to me: 'Who is this Barry Gray? He has stolen from the Sparrowgrass Papers,
                  the <emph>style</emph> of the author. Materials are everywhere, and are common
                  property. <emph>But a new style is the author's own.</emph> Tell me the real name
                  of Barry Gray, that I may know upon whom to pour the full measure of my contempt,
                  for I hate these literary pilferers.'"</p>
               <p>"Surely, Doctor, you know what stopped my pen at that time, and so spare me."</p>
               <p>"Suppose we take up Halleck as an example," said the Doctor, sententiously.</p>
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6182-00000038"/>
               <p>"Great heavens, Doctor! Halleck! I know that 'Fanny,' has been assumed by the
                  critics to be an imitation of Don Juan, but, really, it was written before Don
                  Juan was published. Lord Byron's story of Beppo suggested the metre, and Halleck
                  wrote 'Fanny' before Don Juan had crossed the Atlantic."</p>
               <p>"What do you think," said the Doctor, "of his eulogy on Burns? <q>

                  the rotation of the earth, sir. In Cowley's tribute to Dr. Harvey, we find this
                  expression of the poet—full of his subject, the new discovery—the circulation of
                  the blood. <q>

               <p>"So then Cowley was the originator of that thought?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir. I did not say so. His lines had 'an accidental resemblance' to the lines
                  of Dr. Henry King, Bishop of Chichester, who had before written in a poem called
                  the Exequy, an ode dedicated to his deceased wife— <q>

                  </q> There, sir, what do you think of that?"</p>
               <p>"Why, let us all thank God, Doctor, that such things have been modernized. Who the
                  deuce could buy Cowley or Bishop King at this time?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, my learned friend," said the Doctor, "I do not like your remarks. I have paid
                  a great deal of attention to these works of original men, and I would like to
                  conserve them, apart and entire from the vulgar world."</p>
               <p>"What good would that do, Doctor?"</p>
               <p>Dr. Bushwhacker paused. He was evidently moving upon a different plane from the
                  ordinary motion of mortals. His love of uncut editions floated before his eyes.
                  Finally he broke forth:</p>
               <p>"'The blessings of Providence, like the dews of heaven, should fall alike upon the
                  rich and the poor.'—Andrew<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6182-00000040"/> Jackson.
                  There, sir, you have an original quotation from one of the greatest Presidents we
                  ever had."</p>
               <p>"No, Doctor, for in Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy, which is one of the most
                  comical books ever written, you will find on page 391, edition of 1836, printed
                  for B. Blake, the following sentence: <q>
                     <l>'As the rain falls on both sorts, so are riches given to good and bad.'</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>That is so near Jackson's motto, that the accidental resemblance is palpable. Of
                  course General Jackson had read Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy, my learned friend.
                  What hadn't General Jackson read?"</p>
               <p>"Now, Doctor, in regard to these matters, what do you think of Tennyson's <q>
                     <l>'Flowers of all hues, and lovelier through their names,'</l>
                  </q> Introduced in the prologue tothe Princess?"</p>
               <p>The Doctor paused.—"Tennyson is certainly an original poet."</p>
               <p>"But Milton in Book IV, verse 256, in Paradise Lost, as '<hi rend="i"/>flowers of
                  all hues.' Do you think Tennyson stole from Milton?"</p>
               <p>"No, that was an accidental resemblance!"</p>
               <p>"What do you think of Lord Byron?— <q>

               </p>
               <p>"Ah," said the Doctor, 'you are too inquisitive, and too hypercritical. 'Grass
                  springeth not where the grand Turk setteth his foot,' and 'where the spahi's hoof
                  has trod, there verdure flies the bloody sod,' is the same thought expressed in
                  different ways. One is a commonplace method of expressing a superstition common in
                  the days of Fuller; the other a highly imaginative poetical paraphrase of Lord
                  Byron."</p>
               <p>"But the thought was an <emph>accidental resemblance?</emph> eh, Doctor?"</p>
               <p>Dr. Bushwhacker, whose nut-pick had been busily employed during this colloquy, and
                  who had tasted successively the Sherry, the Old Port and the Wanderer of 1822, now
                  laid down the little steel implement, which, in his hand, looked very much like a
                  dentist's tooth filler, brushed the lint of the napkin of his lap, and rose. "You
                  ask me too much," he said. "You overburthen my mind with ridiculous questions, and
                  expect me to find answers for all the quips and cranks of an erratic brain. Do you
                  not know, sir, it is much easier to ask questions than to find answers for them?
                  Good bye, sir; I wish you a very good day. My compliments to your good lady, who,
                  I suppose, is asleep by this time. And a kiss for all the little ones, who, no
                  doubt, are in the same happy condition. I am going, sir, to a country where there
                  are no poets, nor philosophers, nor plagiarists, nor politicians. To-morrow I
                  shall take a steamer for San Francisco, and from that place I shall go to our

                  among the Polar Bears, and the beauties of Arctic vegetation. Farewell! and

               <p>NOTE.—After the Doctor had departed I found on my desk the following paper, which

               <head>XI. Sitka: Our new Acquisition.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY DR. BUSHWHACKER.</head>
               <p>"IN the Americo-Russian archipelago there is an island called by the above name,
                  on which is the capital city of New Archangel. It is situated off a belt of land,
                  fringed with Russian Islands, about thirty miles wide, and three hundred and
                  forty-five miles long; which shuts off one-half of British America from the
                  Pacific; and north of that, the great peninsula, like a shoulder of mutton, tough,
                  sinewy and fat with Arctic animal life, rolls up into the mighty fore-arm of Mount
                  St. Elias, and rolls down in avalanches, eternal snow-storms, glaciers, fogs, and
                  icy rivers to the Pacific on the west side and to the Arctic Sea on the north
                  side. To the consumptive patient the land offers few attractions, but to those
                  philosophers, whose lungs are strong enough to endure the fatigues of a
                  lecture-room, she has an eloquence and beauty, diversified with two volcanoes,
                  whose throats are in a perpetual blaze of excitement. What splendor there is in
                  yonder Aurora Borealis, that for myriads of years has played upon these lakes,
                  streams and mountain peaks! How delicious nature is in her normal condition! I
                  think I hear one of the Strong Minded, say to her lovely companion in philosophy!
                     'Ah,<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6182-00000042"/> Maria! let us lay aside our fans
                  and our <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chignons,</foreign> and put on snow shoes, and
                  explore! Will you go with me from the heated atmosphere of social life into the
                  calm sequestered retreats of Russian America? Shall we build huts of blocks of
                  ice, like the hardy Esquimaux, and wrap ourselves in the drapery of a robe of
                  sable skins or sea otters, worth $20,000 at least, and despise the pomp of this
                  world? You know, my dear, sables are very cheap there. Catherine of Russia had to
                  get her sables by keeping up a very expensive military establishment at Sitka. She
                  was a very illustrious, strong-minded woman, to be sure; and her morals were a
                  little loose, and she poisoned her husband; but what are those trifling enjoyments
                  compared with carrying out a great idea? It is not so cold as the eastern side of
                  the continent. The isothermal lines cause a great moderation in the atmosphere
                  there. Let us establish a school there. There are 78,000 souls—if they have
                  souls—of Calmucs, Creoles, native Indians, Kuriles, Aleutians, and Kodiaks,
                  Kamschatkians and Esquimaux; and how pleasant it will be to teach them the
                  rudiments! By and by they can vote. Fly with me, dear Maria! Do you not long for
                  the snow shoes that will carry you over those vast steppes to a superior
                  intelligence? An intelligence with nature, a communion with her visible forms, a
                  relief from the world, and the sweet sympathy that we shall feel with the Aurora
                  Borealis!'</p>
               <p>The reason why the Czar wishes to dispose of this fertile territory is because he
                  cannot conquer the North Pole, that being the only Pole that has escaped his
                  autocratic fist. It must be said, however, that it affords us many fine harbors
                  for our whalers after animal petroleum, for heretofore we have had but one decent
                  harbor on the Pacific coast, and that is San Francisco. Now we shall have plenty
                  of them, if we are lucky enough to find them in the fogs which are perpetual
                  there.</p>
               <p>The principal inhabitants of this vast territory are mountains. There is not a
                  tree that will risk its vegeable life by attempting to grow there; the low lands
                  are covered with moss instead of grass, and the best kind of Russian shred
                  isinglass springs spontaneously from the crevices of the rocks. Of the amphibious
                  animals, the green seal or moet is most valued there, being highly prized by the
                  Japanese; the Muscovy duck flies about in a very wild state in those high
                  latitudes, while the double-headed eagle preys alike upon the russ and the walrus.
                  Most of the artificial teeth in the United States are made from the tusks of this
                  latter animal, so that in future we shall get our teeth free of duty. The British
                  having heretofore had an exclusive treaty with the Russian government to supply
                  this place with food and ice-picks, no doubt this lucrative branch of commerce
                  will fall into our hands. There is no doubt a vast quantity of gold hidden under
                  the soil, as it has never made its appearance above the surface. It is proposed to
                  get up a Russian Crushing Company to extract this valuable ore from the veins of
                  Mt. St. Elias. Spruce trees not bigger than a wisp broom<pb n="72-73"
                     xml:id="VAC6182-00000043"/> grow in some patches. These are valuable, as a beer
                  is brewed from them, very useful as a remedy for the scurvy. The castle at New
                  Archangel is very heavily garrisoned with 50 Calmucs and Cossacks, mounts 24
                  brass-mounted breech-loaders, five seven-pounders, twelve horse-pistols, two
                  mountain howitzers, one Governor, one Russian flag, two ensigns, and a fast team
                  of Esquimaux dogs for flying artillery practice. The diplomatic correspondence
                  with old Gowrowski, who is the governor of the fort, has not been published as
                  yet, as he asserts the United States government cannot turn him out without the
                  consent of the Senate. The vivid description of this enchanting country by
                  Campbell will no doubt recur to the reader. Speaking of the hardy sailor on that
                  coast, he says: <q>

                  together, that the paternity of some trite quotation is put in question, and at

               <p>If every printing office had a case filled with popular phrases arranged in the
                  manner, of types, it would save much manual labor, and the compositor would be
                  surprised to find how often he had occasion to use them. For so inextricably are
                  these "short sentences drawn from long experience" entangled in the meshes of
                  language, that to eliminate them would be like drawing out of a carpet, the
                  threads that form the pattern. A few of these phrases, usually found floating in
                  the currents of ordinary conversation, will be sufficient to consider in a paper
                  like this: if we were to include those embraced in literature and oratory, it
                  would require foolscap enough to cover the sands of Egypt, and an inkstand as
                  large as one of<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6182-00000044"/> the pyramids. Not being
                  disposed to make such an investment in stationery at present, we shall only play
                  the literary chiffonier and hook a few scraps from the heaps of talk we meet with
                  every day.</p>
               <p>Mr. John Timmins, the broker, says of that stock, "<hi rend="i"/>there is a wheel
                  within a wheel," without giving Paradise Lost, Young's Night Thoughts, and the
                  Prophet Ezekiel credit for a phrase which may have saved him some thousands; and
                  when he tells his boon companions at the club, that as for his wife, who is rather
                  inclined to be extravagant, "<hi rend="i"/>he would deny her nothing," he does not
                  say how much he owes to Samson Agonistes for the words he makes use of. When he
                  reaches his house, Mrs. Timmins takes him to task "for coming home at such an hour
                  of the night, in such a state;" to which he replies, in a gay and festive manner:
                  "My dear, '<hi rend="i"/>To err is human—to forgive, divine,'" from Pope's essay
                  on criticism; to which Mrs. T. answers in a snappish way, "Timmins, '<hi rend="i"
                  />there is a medium in all things,'" (from Horace). Mr. T., disliking the tone in
                  which this quotation is delivered, "<hi rend="i"/>snatches a fearful joy" (from
                  the "Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College"), by saying he does not intend, in
                  his house, to have "<hi rend="i"/>the grey mare prove the better horse," (from
                  Prior's epilogue). This only "<hi rend="i"/>adds fuel to the flame," (from
                  Milton's Samson), and Mrs. T. observes that if "<hi rend="i"/>we could only see
                  ourselves as others see us," (from Burns), it would be better for some people;
                  that ever since he had joined that club "<hi rend="i"/>a change had come o'er the
                  spirit of her dream," (from Byron): that when she trusted her happiness to him she
                  had "<hi rend="i"/>leaned upon a broken reed, (from Young's Night Thoughts III,
                  and Isaiah 36: 6), and winds up a long lecture with the reflection that "<hi
                     rend="i"/>evil communications corrupt good manners," (from 1st Corinthians
                  15:33). This last expression exasperates Mr. Timmins, and he asks Mrs. T., as he
                  takes off his suspenders, "to whom she alludes?" Is it to Perkins who had stood by
                  him "<hi rend="i"/>in evil report and good report?" (2d Corinthians 6:8). Is it to
                  Rapley? "<hi rend="i"/>a man take him for all in all," (Hamlet, Act I, Scene
                  Second), is "<hi rend="i"/>after his own heart," (Acts 13: 22), and as for Badger,
                  who had extended to him in the tight times of '36 and '37 "<hi rend="i"/>the right
                  hand of fellowship, (Galatians 2: 9), he was as honest a man as ever breathed; and
                  here Mr. Timmins, with one boot in his hand and the other in the boot-jack,
                  eloquently adds, "<hi rend="i"/>an honest man is the noblest work of God!" (from
                  Pope's Essay). He was proud of the friendship of such men, if she meant them. Mrs.
                  T., not at all carried away by such a flood of authorities, rather scornfully
                  says, "O Timmins, '<hi rend="i"/>what is friendship but a name?'" (from
                  Goldsmith's Hermit); at which Mr. T., who by this time is undressed, and "<hi
                     rend="i"/>as made as a March hare, (from the old English superstition), puts
                  out the candle "<hi rend="i"/>in the twinkling of an eye," (1st Corinthians 15:
                  52), lies down as far as possible from the "<hi rend="i"/>weaker vessel," (1st
                  Epistle of Peter 2: 17), courts "<hi rend="i"/>tired Nature's sweet restorer,
                  balmy sleep!" (Young's Night Thoughts), and wakes next morning "<hi rend="i"/>a
                  sadder and a wiser man," (in Coleridge's Ancient Mariner).</p>

               <p>If we turn from the frescoed bed-chamber of Mrs. Timmins to the white-washed
                  kitchen of Jim Skiver, the shoemaker, we find language not less elevated. Jim
                  throws a leg of mutton upon the table and says: "There, Mary, I had '<hi rend="i"
                  />to take Hobson's choice," although Jim had neither read the 509th Spectator, nor
                  knew that Hobson's epitaph had been written by Milton. Jim, not "<hi rend="i"
                  />having the fear of" Beaumont and Fletcher "<hi rend="i"/>before his eyes,"
                  (Romans 3: 18), says, if he can "catch that man wot gave Bill Baxter a black eye
                  the day afore his weddin' he'll '<hi rend="i"/>lamm' him", (King and No King, Act
                  V, Scene Third). To which Mary replies: "I thought somethin' would happin: '<hi
                     rend="i"/>the course of true love never did run smooth,'" (Midsummers Night's
                  Dream, Act I, Scene 1), and Jim responds, "That's so; and they've put off the
                  weddin' so often that it seems kind o' '<hi rend="i"/>hopin' agin' hope,'" (Romans
                  4: 18). Jim thinks after they've had a "<hi rend="i"/>snack," (Pope and Dryden),
                  they had better go see the Siamese Twins; "<hi rend="i"/>twins tied by nature; if
                  they part, they die," (Young's Night Thoughts); puts on "<hi rend="i"/>a hat not
                  much the worse for wear," (John Gilpin), "<hi rend="i"/>dashes through thick and
                  thin," (same authority and Hudibras), and after he has seen the Siamese, requests
                  to see the "<hi rend="i"/>Lilliputian King," (from Gulliver's travels).</p>
               <p>How much language would be left us if these estrays were returned to their lawful
                  owners, is a question. How could we console the dying if we had to give up to
                  Gay's twenty-seventh Fable the phrase, "<hi rend="i"/>while there is life<hi
                     rend="i"/>there's hope?" and what could we say to the good in misfortune if we
                  had to restore to Prior's Ode, "<hi rend="i"/>"Virtue is her own reward?" The
                  shopkeeper who ends his long list of fancy articles with "<hi rend="i"/>and other
                  articles too tedious to mention," makes use of a sentence as old as the Latin
                  language, and we would take the point from Byron's hit at Coleridge, if we were to
                  replace in "Garrick's Epilogue on Leaving the Stage," "<hi rend="i"/>a
                  fellow-feeling makes us wondrous kind." So, too, must Goldsmith's Hermit lose "<hi
                     rend="i"/>man wants but little here below," if Young's Night Thought, IV, had
                  its own property: and "<hi rend="i"/>all the jargon of the schools," from Burns'
                  1st epistle to J. Lapraik must be rendered up to Prior's "Ode on Exodus," which
                  has a prior claim to it. Mr. Achitophel Scapegrace thinks the biggest stockholders
                  in the Roaring River Canal Co. will have the best chance, as "<hi rend="i"/>all
                  the big fish will eat up the little ones," (Pericles, Prince of Tyre, Act II,
                  Scene First), and Mr. Bombastes Linderwold talks of a "<hi rend="i"/>platform" in
                  precisely the same sense as Cromwell did two hundred years ago, (Queries in Letter
                  97, Carlyle). It is in Cromwell's seventh letter that we find for the first time
                  that apt conjunction, "<hi rend="i"/>a gentleman and a Christian," now somewhat
                  threadbare from misuse, and if we want "<hi rend="i"/>mother-wit," we must look
                  for it in Spenser's Faërie Queen, Book IV., Canto X, verse 21. Every body has seen
                  the man in Greek costume who sells soap by the ball but nobody but Mr. Leviticus
                  Gaylord suggested, "that if another Greek should meet that Greek then would be<pb
                     n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6182-00000046"/> a tug of war," and he has authority for
                  saying so in the Rival Queens, Act IV, Scene First. We have to go back to Thomas ä
                  Kempis for "<hi rend="i"/>man proposes but God disposes;" but "<hi rend="i"/>what
                  if thou withdraw and no friend takes note of thy departure?" was written by a
                  young man only eighteen years of age nearly fifty years ago.<ref rend="super"

                   If we want to look up "<hi rend="i"/>the solemn brood of care," we can
                  find that, "<hi rend="i"/>and each one, as before, will chase his favorite
                  phantom," in Thanatopsis. There, too, we will see the hills "<hi rend="i"
                  />rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun," but "<hi rend="i"/>old as the hills" is
                  older than the "<hi rend="i"/>oldest inhabitant," and like him, has lost its
                  parent. If we need "<hi rend="i"/>to point a moral and adorn a tale," we must get
                  Dr. Johnson's "Vanity of Human Wishes," and "<hi rend="i"/>he that runs may read,"
                  in Cowper's "Tirocinium," and "<hi rend="i"/>he may run that readeth it," in
                  Habakuk 2: 2. If any person wish to "<hi rend="i"/>consume the midnight oil," let
                  him read Gay's Shepherd and Philosopher, and in Congreve's "Mourning Bride" he
                  will find "<hi rend="i"/>music hath charms to soothe a savage breast." "<hi
                     rend="i"/>To be in the wrong box," will occur to him who has dipped into the
                  sixth book of "Fox's Martyrs," and Napoleon found "<hi rend="i"/>that from the
                  subline to the ridiculous there is but one step," in Tom Paine's works translated
                  and published in France, in 1791. We take "<hi rend="i"/>buds of promise," from
                  Young's "Last Day," "<hi rend="i"/>and men talk only to conceal their mind," from
                  his "Love of Fame," although we attribute the thought to Talleyrand. "<hi rend="i"
                  />Good breeding<hi rend="i"/>is the blossom of good sense," is not quite so
                  familiar, but it is also in the "Love of Fame," from whence we get the original of
                  what Matilda Jane Peabody believes when she ties up her hair before the looking
                  glass and says that "Louisa Perkins and Betsey Baker can't hold a candle to
                     <emph>her.</emph>" "<hi rend="i"/>To hold their farthing candle to the sun" is
                  in her mind, or its equivalent. "<hi rend="i"/>Who shall decide when doctors
                  disagree?" is a question we may well ask between the Allopathists and the
                  Homœpathists, and Pope puts it in his "Fourth Moral Essay." In "Lochiel's Warning"
                  we find "<hi rend="i"/>coming events cast their shadows before." So Tim Taffeta
                  thinks as he sees the shade deepen upon the brows of his creditor. So Dr. Senna
                  thinks as he sees the premonitory symptoms of coming apoplexy in the fair round
                  proportions of Alderman Broadbutton, and so thinks Peter Pipkin as the delicate
                  adumbration is visible in Mrs. Pipkin's "nature's last best gift," (Paradise Lost,
                  Book 5, line 19), who finds herself "<hi rend="i"/>as women wish to be who love
                  their lords" (Douglass, Act V, Scene First), "<hi rend="i"/>not wisely, but too
                  well." (Othello, Act V, Scene Last). It is impossible to see the Ravels on the
                  tight-rope without thinking of "<hi rend="i"/>the light fantastic toe," and
                  L'Allegro; and "<hi rend="i"/>thoughts that breath and words that burn," live in
                  the magic atmosphere that surrounds the orator, as well as in "Gray's Progress of
                  Poesy." To make a complete collection of these phrases would be the labor of a
                  life; so numerous are they, that if the door is once opened, they pour in "<hi
                     rend="i"/>thick as the leaves in Valambrosa," (Paradise

                  were to cast these pearls before an undiscriminating multitude, after he "<hi
                     rend="i"/>had borne the burden and heat of the day," (Mathew 20:12), his only
                  recompense would be that he had made every one as wise as himself, which the true
                  scholar cannot abide. "<hi rend="i"/>Brevity is the soul of wit," (Hamlet, Act II,
                  Scene Second), and we must make our discourse "<hi rend="i"/>fine by degrees and
                  beautifully less," (Prior's Henry and Emma). These sentences—"<hi rend="i"
                  />jewels, five words long that on the stretched forefinger of old Time sparkle
                  forever," (Tennyson's Princess), are not to be scattered with too liberal a hand,
                  and, therefore, we shall conclude with a quotation peculiarly appropriate:

               <p>MY friend John Common of Roscommon Bay, middle inlet, third house on the left hand
                  side going up, where there is good anchorage for a yacht of several tons burden,
                  propounded the above question one day, after a yawning stretch over the briny bay
                  in a brisk breeze, followed by the usual dead calm, when in sight of home.</p>
               <p>"Does Queen Victoria speak English?"</p>
               <p>"Surely, John Common of Roscommon, she speaks her own <emph>Queen's</emph>
                  English, and that is the <emph>purest</emph> language the Court of St. James has
                  heard since the days of Edward the Confessor."</p>
               <p>John Common of Roscommon lazily puffed his cigar under the canvass canopy of the
                  summer sail, knocked off the ashes with the tip of his little finger, drew a fresh
                  whiff of inspiration from his little brown deity, and said, in a soft voice of
                  rebuke:</p>
               <p>"I know very well that her Majesty is a pure, high-minded, pious, good woman; but
                  my inquiry related not<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6182-00000048"/> to her morals, but
                  to her language; to her vocabulary, if you will, which is the vocabulary of the
                  realm; the court language, the language of polite society;—in fact, that arbitrary
                  style of speaking which is commonly known as the Queen's English, the mother
                  tongue of British scholars, statesmen, and of the highly educated classes of that
                  country; and that is what I meant. I have a theory of my own upon that subject,"
                  he continued, "and I merely asked the question of you in order that I might have
                  an opportunity to answer it myself."</p>
               <p>"A theory! a theory!" cried out several voices from the cabin of the yacht, where
                  the clinking of ice had been heard for several minutes, and out came the party.
                  John Littlejohn, and William Williamson, and Peter Peterson, and Sandy Sanderson,
                  and several others. They arranged themselves on the seats under the shadow of the
                  sail, cigars were handed around; it was a dead calm on the bay, and so John Common
                  of Roscommon began:</p>
               <p>"I have never yet heard an Englishman speak, who pretended to use the Queen's
                  vernacular, without tracing in his language a vein of cockney running in it, like
                  a gold thread through a velvet cloth. And this quite as plain and distinct among
                  the highly educated, as among the rest of her Majesty's subjects.</p>
               <p>"I maintain that custom does not sanction the misuse of the eighth letter, or as
                  Rare Ben Johnson quotes it, 'the queen mother of consonants,' although it may
                  excuse it. Certainly, when we consider the matter fairly, we must conclude that
                  there is as much impropriety in substituting for the beautiful Greek female name
                  'Helen' the modern English name of 'Ellen,' as there would be in calling 'Emma'
                  'Hemma,' which the Court of St. James will very speedily do, unless a stop is put
                  to further innovation.</p>
               <p>"In citing the name of 'Helen,' for so unquestionably the <emph>Hellenes</emph>
                  pronounce it, I had a further object in view, and that was to follow up the stream
                  of cockneyism to its classical fountain. The Greeks were probably the original
                  cockneys—at least we can trace the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">spiritus
                     asper</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">spiritus lenis</foreign> to
                  them. There might have been still earlier cockneys, and it is not unreasonable to
                  suppose that in the confusion of tongues at the destruction of the Tower of Babel,
                  that the family of <hi rend="i"/>H's might have first adopted the unsettled and
                  wandering mode of life which they have led elsewhere, and are now leading in the
                  English language; but so far as that is concerned, it is mere conjecture, and,
                  therefore, very likely to mislead us in our course of inquiry after truth."</p>
               <p>Then he continued:</p>
               <p>"It is quite easy to follow the current down after striking the parent spring. In
                  the time of Romulus and Remus, no doubt the original Latin was a pure sonorous
                  language, a little barbarous, to be sure, but stuck as full of H's as the cloves
                  in old-fashioned boiled ham (and a rich dish that would be now, with the present
                  tax on spices); but as the Romans waxed opulent, gave up wars and patriotism,
                     and<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6182-00000049"/> began to cultivate arts and
                  lassitude, the introduction of schools prepared the way for the Greek accent; it
                  became the rage to imitate the style of Athens, as well in its oratory as in its
                  sculpture and in its architecture; and when Cicero spoke in the affected and
                  voluptuous diction of Alcibiades, and Cæsar fell at the foot of a marble image,
                  then the decadence of Empire began.</p>
               <p>"The languages, of which the Latin was the primitive stem, such as the Italian,
                  the Spanish, the Portuguese and the French, easily adopted the accent of Rome when
                  Rome was in its decay. These modern languages cast off their <hi rend="i"/>H's,
                  and to this day the French Academy, the Spanish Academy, the Universities of Padua
                  and of Parma have never been able to recall them. In the language of a Spanish
                  lexicographer, 'H is not properly considered as a letter, but as a mere
                  aspiration.' The Spanish Academy has also banished the hard sound of the h in
                     <foreign xml:lang="SPA">chimico, chimera, chamelote,</foreign> etc., by writing
                  instead, <foreign xml:lang="SPA">quimico, quimera, camelote.</foreign> So that the
                  eighth letter is torn up root and branch, in the Kingdom of Isabella the Catholic,
                  and the consequence is that they have a revolution in Spain every six years. In a
                  short time Cuba will be on a detached service. It is significant that the natives
                  of the <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Siempre Fiel</foreign> pronounce 'Habana' with
                  enough ejaculation of breath upon the first letter to blow a Spanish fleet from
                  its anchorage.</p>
               <p>"But to return to the Queen's English. Before the Norman Conquest England had a
                  language of its own— not Saxon altogether, but <emph>English!</emph> that great,
                  pithy, thoughtful, bold, full-fraughted, mother tongue, which even now constitutes
                  the substance and strength of the highest powers of intellectual expression; not
                  to be excelled in any language. I might almost say not to be <emph>matched</emph>
                  by any foreign idiom.</p>
               <p>"I am speaking now of the pure English, that is spoken only by educated people in
                  New York city and its immediate vicinity.</p>
               <p>"No person who wishes to attain a lofty style can safely depart from the good old
                  English idiom. It is to glowing eloquence and sparkling rhetoric, what a
                  blacksmith's bellows is to a forge.</p>
               <p>"This language, notwithstanding it was so splendidly celebrated by old Thomas
                  Churchyard, (Tempus Henry VII), had unfortunately been corrupted long before his
                  time by the Normans. William Conqueror introduced a court cockney dialect, which
                  had descended from the Greek cockneys to the Roman cockneys, from the Roman
                  cockneys to every branch of the Latin family, and from the derivatory Norman
                  French it spread through to Whitechapel and Threadneedle streets, through Windsor
                  and Buckingham Palaces, and from thence to the hearts and homes of an imitative

               <p>"But every innovation has its reaction. The common people of England, in those
                  early days, seeing that their beloved H's were being knocked off the household
                  words, like the noses from the Elgin marbles, revenged themselves by clapping an H
                  in front of every naked and exposed vowel. The consequence is that we have such
                  words as '<hi rend="i"/>hedge' for edge, '<hi rend="i"/>hall' for all, '<hi
                     rend="i"/>hogshead' for oxhead, and the like. It would be too much of a task to
                  cite all the corruptions of a similar nature in the language. The mere mention of
                  these will suggest swarms of others, familiar to every reader of ordinary books,
                  to say nothing of philologists.</p>
               <p>"Take the word 'hedge' for example. Originally it meant something. It meant an
                     <emph>edge,</emph> a boundary of shrubs, indicating the limit of the field or
                  of the estate. We have it yet in 'box edgings,' which are partitions of garden
                  beds, and meaning the same thing precisely. Shakspeare says, 'Upon the
                     <emph>edge</emph> of yonder coppice,' etc., (Loves Labor Lost, IV, I). Now it
                  has lost its significance in becoming a h'edge.</p>
               <p>"So with the word '<hi rend="i"/>hear.' We speak of <emph>hearing</emph> an
                  argument. That would be considered as proper Queen's English, would it not? But
                  suppose any one should say that he had een '<hi rend="i"/>h'eying' a street fight?
                  Would that not be a painful sound to ears polite? And yet both words are derived
                  from their original substantives, the ear and the eye, and the verb to '<hi
                     rend="i"/>hear' is as plain a cock-neyism as the verb to heye, when we come to
                  think of it. You say an 'ear-witness' as well as an 'eye-witness,' do you not? If
                  anybody should say an 'hear-witness,' what would you think of that? And yet it is
                  no greater an impropriety than 'hear' is in the mouths of polite people. No one
                  can for a moment doubt that according to the mechanism of the language, 'to <hi
                     rend="i"/>ear' a person is quite as proper a form of expression as 'to <hi
                     rend="i"/>eye a person,' and that the H in 'hear' is an insupportable
                  cockneyism. So with the superfluous 'H' in 'hall.' In old mansions in England, the
                  main apartments, the great audience chamber, the dining-room, the vast
                  conservatory where the noble guests sat above the salt, where the pilgrim<pb
                     n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6182-00000051"/> warmed his rain-drenched, threadbare
                  garments by the fire; where the minstrel tuned his wretched harp, and every
                  condition of life was represented, in this vast vaulted chamber, the '<foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">aula,</foreign>' the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">atrium,</foreign>
                  the all in all of the manorial and baronial residence, what right had an H to
                  strike out the significance of the original word? There is no doubt in this case
                  at all. For the 'Manor All,' the 'Town All,' and so on in all the grand old
                  English words, must be replaced. If you have a little, narrow strait between your
                  parlor and your side wall, call it an <emph>entry,</emph> if you will, but do not
                  call it a h'all</p>
               <p>"So with the bird of wisdom, the owl. Everybody has heard her note who has lived
                  in the country. It is 'how, how, how, how, howl!' From this we get the name of
                  this fowl of Minerva. The bird of night, in the new-born nakedness of early
                  English, was undoubtedly the 'Howl.' We find it still in its diminutives, such as
                  'Howlet.' <q>
                     <l>'And keep her place as '<hi rend="i"/>Howlet' does her tower.'</l>
                  </q> In the Scotch vocabularies Houlet is the word, not <emph>owl.</emph> And, by
                  the way, none of these French cockneyisms appear in either the Scottish or Irish
                  dialects. I believe their idiomatic languages to be purer than the modern English.
                  Shakspeare does not have any allusion to cockneyism in his time, except when he
                  shows his knowledge of the Greek language in his Athenian play, by putting into
                  the mouth of Bottom the Weaver' '<hi rend="i"/>Ercles for Hercules.<ref

                  of the listener, which he can fill up himself at leisure. Let me say here,
                  however, that, save Chaucer, there are few writers of our earlier English who so
                  Frenchify the mother tongue as he does. In Piers Ploughman<ref rend="super"

                  Hermit, and so it is used to this day by some of the English, even in writing. But
                  generally the language of these old authors was pure, as indeed it was from the
                  time of Chaucer to the Restoration. After King Charles II came in, we had the
                  French affectation introduced, as lively as it was in the days of William the
                  Conqueror.</p>

               <p>"Now a few words more: there is the word 'hatchet,' the diminutive of axe, the
                  original of which is <foreign xml:lang="ANG">eax,</foreign> Saxon, (or <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">ascia,</foreign> Latin). It should of course be <hi rend="i"
                  />atchet. So we have hatchment, a corruption of the heraldric word '<hi rend="i"
                  />achievement,' meaning an armorial escutcheon; then there is the word ability,
                  which, in the dictionaries of a century old, is spelled properly, '<hi rend="i"
                  />hability,' or able—'<hi rend="i"/>hable,' from the French; arquebus, we say,
                  instead of <hi rend="i"/>harquebus, and artichoke instead of <hi rend="i"
                  />hartichoke, and the like.</p>
               <p>"Then, again, consider the number of words from which the H is omitted in
                  pronunciation: 'onorable, 'umble<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6182-00000052"/> ble,
                  'umor, 'eir, 'ome, sweet 'ome, 'ow, 'onest, and the like. Then, again, such words
                  as 'ostler for hostler, (from host or hostel), 'arbor for harbor, (a shelter),
                  Oboe for haut bois, and so on, where the abuse is sanctioned by the dictionary
                  makers.</p>
               <p>"You will commonly find, too, that well-educated Englishmen (and women) say 'oo,
                  for who, 'andiron for hand'iron, 'ow for how, and 'anging for hanging. They deny
                  it, of course, and will, if they think they are watched, pronounce these words
                  properly, but they are sure to relapse as soon as they are left to themselves. If
                  you were to ask Lord John Russell, who is esteemed to be as deep in erudition as
                  he is in diplomacy, how to spell the letter H, he would, no doubt, spell it
                  a-i-t-c-h, when in truth it should be h-a-i-t-c-h, with a strong aspiration on the
                  first letter."</p>

                  <p>"TO continue," said John Common of Roscommon. "To leave this class of
                     impediments of speech behind, and go further, we find many defects in modern
                     English, derived from the same parentage. For example—there is no Win the
                     French alphabet. If you were to ask a Frenchman to pronounce the name of the
                     first President of the United States, he would say "Vashington," or he might,
                     by a strong mental effort, get as near to it as <hi rend="i"/>Guashington. Just
                     as if you were to ask him the name of the second President, he would be obliged
                     to reply "<hi rend="i"/>Hadams," and so forth. Now there is not one single word
                     in the English language beginning with the letter V that is not derived from
                     the French, the Spanish, the Italian, or some of the cognate branches of the
                     Latin family of words. There is no V in the Anglo-Saxon alphabet, none in the
                     Mœso-Gothic, from which two tongues we derive our mother tongue, none in the
                     earlier editions of English authors; take, for example, Grafton's or
                     Hollinghead's Chronicles, or any other work of that<pb n="92-93"
                        xml:id="VAC6182-00000053"/> period. Hence it is that we find such
                     expressions in the modern British classics as: "Now, Shiny <hi rend="i"
                     />Villiam, give the gen'lem'n the ribbons,"<ref rend="super" target="#note_009"

                      or "<hi rend="i"/>vot's the use of giving <hi rend="i"/>vay so long as
                     you're 'appy;" of which forms of expression numbers could be produced if one
                     could give his mind, his time, and his attention to it. I do not mean to say
                     that the substitution of the V for the W is common to the upper classes of
                     Great Britain. Far from it; but I do mean to say that this innovation is
                     creeping up, and will, by and by, beget a class of words foreign to the genius
                     of the English tongue, just as the dropping of the H has produced such words as
                     ostler and arbor.</p>

                  <p>In confirmation of this, let me state that a distinguished traveler and
                     philosopher, Mr. George Gibbs, of Long Island, after a residence of a quarter
                     of a century on the Northwest coast of this continent, has written a dictionary
                     of the Chinook jargon, or Trade Language of Oregon, prepared for the
                     Smithsonian Institute, Washington, D. C.,<ref rend="super" target="#note_011"
                        xml:id="return_011">‡</ref>
                      in which he shows conclusively that the Chinook, the Nootkan, the
                     Yakama, the Cathlasco, (which is a corrupted form of the Watlala or Upper
                     Chinook), the Toquat (which he spells Tokwaht), and the Nittinak languages have
                     been corrupted by the mis-pronunciation of the English of the Hudson's Bay
                     Company. The consequence is, that there is scarcely an H in its proper place in
                     any of the dialects of the Northwestern tribes of the Pacific, and W's are
                     substituted for V's to such an extent, that in his dictionary not one word
                     beginning with the latter consonant can be discovered. It is, however, a
                     consolation to know that these are the most prominent innovations in those rich
                     and beautiful occidental tongues. After complaining that the Spanish and French
                     voyageurs have left traces of their languages in the earlier Chinook, he
                     says:</p>

                     hequal. Just in proportion to the cockneyism of the upper classes in the middle
                     ages arose the defiant attitude of the cockneyism of the lower classes. The
                     doubleyous began to crowd into the lower ten million vocabulary. "Weal pie"
                     took the place of the other word: <q>

                  <p>There was a stout battle between the starveling French V and the broad bottomed
                     English W, and to this day it has continued. There is not a member of any
                     English legation in any part of the world, at this present time, who dares to
                     spell "Vaterloo" with a V. And this is in obedience to the dictates of the
                     lower, and, I might almost say, the illiterate classes; for after all, a mob
                     has a great deal to do with fixing the expression as well as the meaning of
                     words.</p>
                  <p>Since I am so far committed to this subject, I must continue a little longer;
                     but let me say here, that if I tax the old nation from which we are derived,
                     with speaking a very impure language, let me at least have the credit of doing
                     so in a friendly spirit. Let us with one hand soothe the American
                     Lexicographical Eagle, while with the other we smooth the bristling mane of the
                     British Polyglot.</p>
                  <p>In further confirmation of what I have already advanced, permit me to recall to
                     every mind another phrase of the language of the realm, in order to prove that
                     the queen speaks broken French. I do not mean to say that she does so
                     intentionally, for surely no one can have a higher regard for that good lady
                     than I have. In fact, we are both of an age; both born on the same day of the
                     same month in the same year, perhaps in the same hour, if degrees of longitude
                     could be computed with accuracy, (of different parentage, I admit). What I mean
                     to say is, that she speaks imperfect English, both of herself and through her
                     ministers, through her parliaments, through her lords and her lord mayors,
                     through her ladies and her laundresses, through her British museum, and her
                     Billingsgate market. After all this explanation, which might lead to a
                     digression, let me return to the point that I intended to make when I said that
                     the queen speaks broken French.</p>
                  <p>Nothing is more striking to an American when he first visits London than the
                     constant misuse of the French "<hi rend="i"/>A" pronounced <hi rend="i"/>aw by
                     the high school of cockneys. The lower classes of her majesty's subjects use
                     the plain old fashioned English "<hi rend="i"/>A" as an expletive, as well as
                     an offset to the other (a fashion, by the way, derived from the Greeks, for
                     their language is full of expletives), in this manner—I was "<hi rend="i"
                     />a-going," or, I was "a-thinking," or, I was "a-'oping," or, I was
                     "a-hironing," and so on through the whole family of verbs. Now this misuse of
                     the vowel is so common to the common people, that to hear it from the lips of
                     any person is sufficient to suggest that his education has been quite
                     imperfect. This being so, <emph>is it quite fair</emph> that we should acquit
                     Lord Brobdignag of a similar charge, when we hear him read from a master of
                     style, thus: "They say-<hi rend="i"/>aw that it was <hi rend="i"/>aw-Liston's
                     firm belief, that he-aw was aw-great and neglected tragic actaw. They say-aw
                     that ev-aw-ry one of us believes, in his heart, or would like-aw to have others
                     believe, that he-aw is something which he is aw-not!"</p>
                  <p>It is very true, as Dr. Samuel Johnson says in his little<pb n="96-97"
                        xml:id="VAC6182-00000055"/> article on Orpiment, that "talk is elastic." But
                     even talk he mis-spells, (for he means "<hi rend="i"/>talc," a mineral),
                     nevertheless we will accept the mistake as being truer than his definition in
                     every way. Talk is elastic! but what shall be said of the petrifiers of the
                     living words of our language? What shall we say, for example, of the abuses of
                     Webster's Dictionary? When an elastic language becomes a concretion of
                     fossils—when its life has gone out, and lexicographers have left nothing of it
                     but its organic remains—what should be done with them? To compel them to speak
                     plain English would be impossible, for that they do not comprehend. What should
                     be done with them? Surely the Cadmus teeth they sow should rise up and reap
                     them.</p>
                  <p>I suppose, in time, that the good old English word "Beef-eater," as applied to
                     those broad-backed warders of the Tower of London, will degenerate into
                     "Buffetier" (French), as now a revolution is being effected in a similar
                     word—and "<hi rend="i"/>cur," which some writers claim as a Hindoo word,
                        "<foreign xml:lang="HIN">Ischur.</foreign>"<ref rend="super"

                      Blackstone, (a famous law writer of the last century), has endeavored
                     to elevate the tone of the British bar by changing the honest old name of
                     "bum-bailey" in this wise: He says "that the special bailiffs are usually bound
                     in a bond for the due execution of their office, and thence are called
                        'bound-bailiffs,'<emph>which the common people</emph> have corrupted into a

                  <p>I cannot here avoid expressing my regret that a very creditable weekly paper in
                     the British booksellers' interest in London should have its classical name
                     corrupted into "a much more homely appellation." I mention this the more
                     cheerfully from the fact that it has always abused American authors, and,
                     therefore, when I say that I regret it, you will understand that it is an act
                     of generosity on my part. I allude to the <title>Athenæum,</title> which has
                     never recovered from the punishment that Bulwer inflicted upon it when he
                     called it the "Ass-i-neum," a name by which it has been known to cultivated
                     people in all parts of the world, from the days of Paul Clifford down to this
                     time.</p>
                  <p>But these corruptions of the language we must frown down. Let us take a bold
                     stand against other cockneyisms creeping into public use, such as "<hi rend="i"
                     />cab" for cabriolet, "<hi rend="i"/>pants" for pantaloons, "<hi rend="i"
                     />canter" from the Canterbury pilgrimages at the good old-fashioned ambling
                     pace, and the like; for, if we do not, the age of progress will make the word
                     "gentleman" a dead language, and only its cockney substitute, the "<hi rend="i"
                     />gent," will be known in dictionaries and newspapers.</p>
                  <p>A few more words and I shall wind up my squid.</p>
                  <p>There is a slang phrase of Parisian-French, which I<pb n="98-99"
                        xml:id="VAC6182-00000056"/> cannot recall at this moment, that expresses a
                     peculiar way of shortening words, and running one into another, in use among
                     the fashionable people of the continental metropolis, so that it is very
                     difficult for a novice to understand their aristocratic <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >argot.</foreign>
                  </p>
                  <p>This shrinkage, this corrugation, this wrinkling up of words, so that a good
                     long sentence which should be sonorous and expressive, becomes as shrivelled as
                     a washerwoman's thumb, is beautifully implanted in the modern English. Go to
                     the House of Lords and hear the debate between Lord Brobdignag and the Marquis
                     of Lilliput! Only by the skill of the practised reporter can that tongued and
                     grooved dialect be interpreted. I shall not give you a sentence by way of
                     example, but only a few specimen bricks of this modern Babel.</p>
                  <p>It is well known that in the glorious old English tongue every word carries a
                     meaning with it; a little history in its womb, such as those beautiful phrases
                     "belly-timber," as applied to food, and "bread-basket," as applied to its
                     receptacle. So the lord of thousands of broad acres in Merrie England— <cit>
                        <q>
                           <l>"Lovely in England's <emph>fadeless</emph> green."</l>
                        </q>
                        <bibl>—Halleck—</bibl>
                     </cit> was called the Earl of "<hi rend="i"/>Beau-champs," from the Norman
                     French, as m Scotland the name of Campbell is derived from an Italian origin
                     meaning the same thing, as Beau-champs, "Campo-bello." Just as the
                     constellation in the Southern hemisphere called "Charles' Oak," recalls the
                     history of that royal and ragged refugee, in Boscobell, so a vast number of
                     words in English once represented ideas. They were words with poetry and
                     history locked up within them, like flies, in perpetual amber. The river "Alne"
                     in Cumberland, the stream celebrated in many a border foray, has upon its banks
                     the ancient town of Alnecester, and the "home of the Percy's high-born race,"
                     Alnwick Castle. Should you inquire for either place, there is not a man in
                     England who would understand you. But just ask for Anster and Annick, and there
                     is not a red-coated boot-brushing boy in the neighborhood of Temple Bar that
                     cannot tell you where to find the train that will carry you to the residence of
                     the Lord's of Northumberland. I remember once that I hired a post and pair to
                     go down to Stratford-upon-Avon. A jaunty postilion in spotless, white dimity
                     knee breeches, white top boots, silver-rimmed hat-band, and a whole carillon of
                     bell buttons on his jacket, touched his hat as I stepped into the "shay."
                     "Drive me round," said I, "by the way of Charlecote Hall!" for I wished to see
                     the place where Shakspeare was tried for deer-stealing. That was a puzzler. The
                     friendly landlord of the "Warwick Arms," the aged Pensioner of the Bear and
                     Ragged Staff; the obsequious waiter; the radical tailor, who made red riding
                     coats for fox-hunting squires and d——d them in the bitterness of his sartorial
                     soul; the small boy that always followed a stranger as the mitefly follows a
                     cheese; the parochial Beadle with his bell; the blue eyes of the chambermaid,
                     from an upper story<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6182-00000057"/> of the Warwick
                     Arms; all, in dire suspense, in that dewy morning, waited to hear the reply of
                     the post-boy. There was no reply. Presently an underhostler, who had been
                     hovering around the horses like a spiritual gad-fly, whose wings were
                     horse-brush, and curry-comb, spoke out in a foggy voice: "P'raps the gemman
                     means Chawcut?" Shade of Shakspeare! And <hi rend="i"/>chawcut it was, as
                     everybody understood it there. So it is that in this puckered-up
                     English,—Warwick, itself a splendidly significant name, becomes Waric. The
                     Beauchamp Chapel is Beecham. Charlesbury has lost its ancient significance in
                     Chawbree. Cholmondely is Chumlee. Berwick of old renown, "<emph>royal</emph>
                     Berwick's beach of sand," is now Berric; Candlewick Street in London, is
                     Cannick; Gloucester is Gloster, Smithfield is Smiffld, and Worcester—Wooster!
                     So, too, that word dear to every domestic tie, "housewife," is
                        "<emph>hussif,</emph>" subtle is "<emph>suttle,</emph>" and High Holburn,
                        <hi rend="i"/>I-oburn.</p>
                  <p>Can anybody doubt that the corruption of these good old expressive English
                     words into bastard French is not undermining the Queen's English?</p>
                  <p>And the mis-spelling of these and many other words will soon follow the
                     mis-pronunciation, as, indeed, some do now—witness "Gloster!" I once hired an
                     English hackman to take me from a once-celebrated hotel in New York to a
                     once-celebrated Hudson river steamboat. It chanced that when we reached the
                     wharf the boat was casting off, and the driver called out to me, "You 'ad
                     better 'urry up, sir, or she'll be h'off, and you can pay me the fare when you
                     get 'ome agin." So when I did get back again, and asked for my little account,
                     he referred to his pocket remembrancer—"Mr. C., June 14th, 1842. <hi rend="i"
                     />m. o. to <hi rend="i"/>e. u." "What does that mean?" "'Merican 'Otel to
                     'Endrick 'Udson, sir!"</p>
                  <p>"And what," said little Tweedle, "are we to do. If we go to England, are we to
                     fly in the face of every man there? are we to insist upon our own
                     pronunciation, and endeavor to find out famous localities by naming them in the
                     language used in the Saxon Heptarchy?"</p>
                  <p>"Certainly," said John Common of Roscommon, "I would advise you to agitate this
                     subject; to call things by their right names in that benighted kingdom; to
                     inquire for places that nobody can tell you anything about, so that you can
                     teach the ignorant natives what should be the names of their choicest, their
                     dearest, their most cherished localities. You can do this thing, for you have a
                     genius for disturbing the old herring-bone foundations of ancient edifices. And
                     I will give you all the glory of being the pioneer, if you choose to take this
                     matter of reform of the tongue upon your own shoulders. I may adopt it also.
                     But I shall not trumpet forth my claims upon the world until I find that you
                     have succeeded. I think I feel a fresh breeze creeping up. Haul away on the jib
                     halyards! Let us see if we can't work up the creek. The champagne has been in
                     the cooler over there for five hours now and the meats only go to the brander
                     upon signal. So haul up the dinner signal! Ah, here comes the breeze! Up sails,
                     and now to dinner."</p>

               <head>XIV. The Noses of Eminent Men.</head>
               <p>OF all the quadrupeds, the elephant is, unquestionably, the most sagacious. And,
                  although some have fondly imagined that his sagacity is wholly owing to his great
                  bulk—just as we are apt to think wisdom is peculiar to the fat, or judgment to the
                  thickset—yet, in justice to the elephant, we must not allow the world to repose
                  upon so absurd and preposterous an error. If mere bulk were wisdom, what shall be
                  said of the hippopotamus; of coroners, and aldermen; of justices to the peace, the
                  rhinoceros, and the commissioners of the Patent-office; of prize-medal pigs, and
                  Gen.—? We see, at once, the fallacy of the popular belief, when we consider the
                  very opposite relations existing between bulk and wisdom, in the above examples.
                  It is needless here to enter into an elaborate detail of the symphathetic
                  attachments of the brain and the nose, extending through an infinite ramification
                  of nerves, arteries, ganglions, and tissues, nor of the power of the organ itself
                  to express emotion; to scorn, to sneer, to snivel, to affirm, ordeny; to put
                  itself intrusively where it is not wanted; to be arrogant, haughty, conceited; to
                  suffer indignities; to be a sleeping-trumpet, and a moral, psalm-singing
                  instrument in the conventicle. The relations between the brain and this organ, are
                  therefore, nearly equivalent to those between a ship and its rudder—with the
                  trifling difference, that we are guided by one, and led by the other. These facts
                  being established, all that is required to be known further, is, whether the
                  dimensions of a nose being given, it is possible to arrive at a fair estimate of
                  the subsidiary mental power, if not, indeed, at a regular scale, such as Kepler
                  has laid down with regard to the planetary system. To this we answer in the
                  affirmative. Let us take the wisest of brutes as an instance. The height of the
                  tallest elephant in the jungles of Africa is ten feet and a half, and the length
                  of his proboscis, from the lower suture of the coronal bone (<foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">os frontis</foreign>), to the tip, is exactly seven feet and an
                  inch. Now, if we add to the height of the elephant his weight and circumference,
                  we find the proportion of the organ to the sum total to be exactly 19 11-60 per
                  centum. If we take, as an offset to this, the commonest and most familiar
                  zoological example, viz., the proportions existing between the weight, height, and
                  bulk of the hippopotamus, and the length of his nose, we find them expressed in
                  round numbers by the fractions 132-33900. And it is a curious scientific fact,
                  that the mental capacities of the two animals—I mean the power of mind—the "think"
                  that is in them, when carefully measured, exhibit nearly the same figures. If,
                  then, guided by these astonishing results, we take up any plethoric body of
                  men—say the United States Congress, or the State Legislature,<pb n="104-105"
                     xml:id="VAC6182-00000059"/> for instance—it is very easy to determine precisely
                  their intellectual value, in a psychological point of view. The average of a board
                  of aldermen, reduced to the scale of half an inch to the foot, exhibits so near an
                  approximation to the proportions of the lesser animal, that we might call them the
                  "city hippopotami", and be accurate enough for ordinary purposes. On the other
                  hand, if we attend a meeting of strong-minded women, we find a prodigious
                  development of this feature. Strong-minded women have immense noses, with some
                  flat hats and a variety of spectacles. Jews, also, are singularly gifted; but we
                  make allowance of at least one-third for organs of this pattern, on account of the
                  natural hook, from the eyebrows to the tip. We once had the honor of being
                  intimate with one of the most profound scholars and thinkers in Holland, who was
                  so long-nosed and near-sighted that he wiped out with his nose half of what he
                  wrote with his pen—thereby showing a memorable instance of wisdom. The average
                  length of a fully-developed, intellectual, male nose, is precisely two inches and
                  a half from the indention between the eyes to the extreme end of the cartilage.
                  Washington's nose was 2 5-8 inches; but the presidential average has, so far, been
                  what we have stated above—Jefferson, for example, representing the longs, and
                  Fill-more the shorts. Wellington and Napoleon differ only the sixteenth of an
                  inch, both being above the average; Lord Brougham, who is an encyclopædia of
                  general information, follows a feature three inches in length! the average nose of
                  the Century Club is 2 9-16; Thackeray's nose is 2 5-8—precisely the length of the
                  nose of the "Father of his country;" President Johnson's is 2 9-16; Irving's, 2
                  7-12; Bryant's, 2 6-11; Dickens's, 2 3-8; Durand's, 2 7-13; Gen. Scott's, 2 5-10;
                  Longfellow's, 2 6-11; Gen. Sherman's 2 1-2; Macaulay's, 2 5-9; Farragut's, 2 3-4;
                  Commodore Wise's, 1 7-12; Tennyson's, 2 4-7; Hoffman's, 2 7-13; the average
                  magazine nose of this city is 1 5-8; in Philadelphia, 1 7-8; McClellan's is 2
                  8-12; Verplancks', 2 5-8; Bayard Taylor's, 2 6-11; we shall have Fredrika Bremer's
                  by next steamer; the nose of the Academy of Design, 2 5-9; Browning's, 2 5-9; Miss
                  Mulock has a very respectable feature for a woman, being 2 1-4; Jean Ingelow, 2
                  1-8; Bonner's, 2 1-2; Seward's, nearly 3 inches, and our own a snub.</p>
               <p>In making our measurements, we have had the greatest difficulties to encounter, by
                  reason of the foolish desire of many to be represented as measuring more than they
                  are entitled to. But, as we know by experience how often scientific data are put
                  aside as worthy of no credit, because of a few trifling defects or errors, we have
                  been guided only by our instruments. We know it is very hard to refuse a sixteenth
                  of an inch, when it is asked by a friend, as a particular favor, but,
                  nevertheless, our "reflections" must be accurate and reliable, or else they will
                  be justly condemned. In pursuance of our theory, we have engaged Mr. Pike, the
                  eminent mathematical instrument maker, to construct for us a noseometer, of the
                  greatest capacity, and will, from time to time, furnish our readers with the
                  results of the observations taken therewith.</p>

               <head>XV. Up the Rhine.</head>
               <head type="sub">A LEAF FROM A NEW BOOK.</head>
               <p>"THE clouds now began to break away—once more we see the distant peaks of the
                  Siebengebirge and the castled crag of Drachenfels—a flush of warm sunlight
                  illuminates the wet deck of the Schnelfahrt; the passengers peep out of the
                  companion-way, and finally emerge boldly, to inhale the fresh air and inspect the
                  beauties of the Rhine. As for the Miller of Zurich, he had taken the shower as
                  kindly as a duck, shaking the drops from his grey woolly coat, as they fell, and
                  tossing off green glass after green glass of Liebfraunmilch, or Assmanshauser,
                  from either bottle. Betimes his pretty wife joined us, and walked on tip-toe over
                  the wet spots; the sun came out, hotter and hotter; the deck, the little tables,
                  the wooden seats, began to smoke; over-coats came off, shawls were laid aside;
                  plates oiled up with<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6182-00000062"/> sweet grapes and
                  monstrous pears, green glasses, and tall flasks of Rhine wine, were handed around
                  to the ladies, and distributed on the tables; and the red-checked German boy whose
                  imitations of English had so amused us, shouted the captain's orders to the
                  engineer below, in a more cheery voice—'<emph>Slore! backor! forror!</emph>'"</p>
               <p>I had had an indistinct vision of a pair of whiskers at the far end of the
                  breakfast table, brushed out <foreign xml:lang="FRA">à l' Anglaise</foreign> in
                  parallel lines, as thin as a gilder's camel's hair brush. These whiskers now came
                  up on deck, attached to a very insignificant countenance, a check cap, and a
                  woollen suit of purplish cloth, such as travellers from Angleterre enjoy scenery
                  in. Across the right breast of this person, a narrow black strap of patent leather
                  wound its way until it found a green leather satchel, just across his left hip;
                  while over his left breast, a similar strap again wound around him, and finally
                  attached itself to a gigantic opera glass in a black leather case. All these
                  implements of travel, with little else to note, paced solemnly up and down the now
                  dry deck of the Schnelfahrt.</p>
               <p>In the meantime, my glass, map, guide book, were all in action, castle following
                  castle, Rolandseck, Rheineck, Andernach, and all the glorious panorama, rolling in
                  view with every turn of the steamer. And chiefly I enjoyed the conversation of my
                  Miller of Zurich, whose plump forefinger anticipated the distant towers and
                  battlements which he had seen so often, for so many times, in yearly trips upon
                  the river. Nor was I alone, for from every stand-point of the deck were fingers
                  pointed, and glasses raised, at the glories of the castellated Rhine.</p>
               <p>But in the midst of this excitement and enthusiasm, that purple traveller, with
                  whiskers and straps, satchel and opera glass, walked up and down, unobservant of
                  the scenery, miserable and melancholic, without a glance at the vineyards, or the
                  mountains, or the castles. Then I knew that he was an Englishman, doing the
                  Rhine.</p>
               <p>He walked up to our table, where old Zurich and his pretty wife were seated before
                  the grapes and the wine, where my shawl and satchel were flung—map spread, and
                  guide-book open—and said, in that peculiar English voice which always suggests
                  catarrh—</p>
               <p>"Going up the Rhine, sir?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Rather,</emph>" said I, drily, (for I hate bores).</p>
               <p>"Aw!"—now the reader must translate for himself—</p>
               <p>"Forst time ye' beene h'yar?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," I answered, "is it your first visit also?"</p>
               <p>"Aw—no! 'beene hea-r pu'foh; sev-wal taimes. How fawr 'goin, sawr?" (Don't talk of
                  Yankee inquisitiveness).</p>
               <p>"To Mayence, and no further this evening." (Opera glass levelled directly at
                  Ehrenbreitstein).</p>
               <p>"Gaw'ng to Hydl'bug?"</p>
               <p>"I think so."</p>

               <p>Here old Zurich makes a remark, and says:</p>
               <p>"Military engineers build, that other military engineers may destroy."</p>
               <p>MYSELF.—"Are those yellow lines against the hill masonry?—parapets?"</p>
               <p>OLD ZURICH.—"Fortified from top to bottom."</p>
               <p>"Gaw'ng to Italy?" chimes in the camel's hair whiskers.</p>
               <p>"No," (decidedly no).</p>

               <p>"'F yawr not gaw'n to Rhawm, it's good bisness to go to Nim—they've got a ring

               <head>XVI. The First Oyster Eater.</head>
               <p>THE impenetrable veil of antiquity hangs over the antediluvian oyster, but the
                  geological finger-post points to the testifying fossil. We might, in pursuing this
                  subject, sail upon the broad pinions of conjecture into the remote, or flutter
                  with lighter wings in the regions of fable, but it is unnecessary: the mysterious
                  pages of Nature are ever opening freshly around us, and in her stony volumes, amid
                  the calcareous strata, we behold the precious mollusc—the <hi rend="i"/>primeval bivalve,<cit>
                     <q>
                        <l>——"rock-ribbed! and ancient as the sun."</l>
                     </q>
                     <bibl>—BRYANT.</bibl>
                  </cit>
               </p>
               <p>Yet, of its early history we know nothing. Etymology throws but little light upon
                  the matter. In vain have we carried our researches into the vernacular of the
                  maritime Phoenicians, or sought it amid the fragments of Chaldean and Assyrian
                  lore. To no purpose have we analyzed the roots of the comprehensive Hebrew, or
                  lost ourselves in the baffling labyrinths of the oriental Sanscrit. The history of
                  the ancient oyster is written in <emph>no</emph> language, except in the universal
                  idiom of the secondary strata! Nor is this surprising in a philosophical point of
                  view. Setting aside the pre-Adamites, and taking Adam as the first
                     <emph>name-giver,</emph> when we <emph>reflect</emph> that Adam lived IN-land,
                  and therefore never saw the succulent periphery in its native mud, we may deduce
                  this reasonable conclusion: viz., that as he never saw it, he probably never NAMED
                  it—never!—not even to his most intimate friends. Such being the case, we must seek
                  for information in a later and more enlightened age. And here let me take occasion
                  to remark, that oysters and intelligence are nearer allied than many persons
                  imagine. The relations between Physiology and Psychology are beginning to be
                  better understood. A man might be scintillant with facetiousness over a plump
                  "Shrewsbery," who would make a very sorry figure over a bowl of water-gruel. The
                  gentle, indolent Brahmin, the illiterate Laplander, the ferocious Libyan, the
                  mercurial Frenchman, and the stolid (I beg your pardon), the <emph>stalwart</emph>
                  Englishman, are not more various in their mental capacities than in their table
                  æsthetics. And even in this century, we see that wit and oysters come in together
                  with September, and wit and oysters go out together in May—a circumstance not
                  without its weight, and peculiarly; pertinent to the subject-matter. With this
                  brief but not irrelevant digression, I will proceed. We have "<foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">Ostreum</foreign>" from the Latins, "<foreign xml:lang="ANG"
                     >Oester</foreign>" from the Saxons, "<foreign xml:lang="DEU">Auster</foreign>"
                  from the Teutons, "<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Ostra</foreign>" from the Spaniards,
                  and "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Huitre</foreign>" from the French—words evidently of
                  common origin—threads spun<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6182-00000065"/> from the
                  same distaff! And here our archaeology narrows to a point, and this point is the
                  pearl we are in search of: viz., the genesis of this most excellent fish.</p>
               <p>"Words evidently derived from a common origin." What origin? Let us examine the
                  venerable page of history. Where is the first mention made of oysters? Hudibras
                  says: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">

               </p>
               <p>This is the first mention in the classics of oysters; and we now approach the
                  cynosure of our inquiry. From this we infer that oysters came originally from
                  Britain. The word is unquestionably <emph>primitive.</emph> The broad open vowelly
                  sound is, beyond a doubt, the <emph>primal,</emph> spontaneous thought that found
                  utterance when the soft, seductive molluse first exposed its white bosom in its
                  pearly shell to the enraptured gaze of aboriginal man! Is there a question about
                  it? Does not every one know, when he sees an oyster, that <emph>that is its
                     name?</emph> And hence we reason that it originated in Britain, was latinized
                  by the Romans, replevined by the Saxons, corrupted by the Teutons, and finally
                  barbecued by the French. Oh, philological ladder by which we mount upward, until
                  we emerge beneath the clear vertical light of Truth!! Me thinks I see the FIRST
                  OYSTER-EATER! A brawny, naked savage, with his wild hair matted over his wild
                  eyes, a zodiac of fiery stars tattooed across his muscular breast—unclad,
                  unsandalled, hirsute and hungry—he breaks through the underwoods that margin the
                  beach, and stands alone upon the sea-shore, with nothing in one hand but his
                  unsuccessful boar-spear, and nothing in the other but his fist. There he beholds a
                  splendid panorama! The west all aglow; the conscious waves blushing as the warm
                  sun sinks to their embraces; the blue sea on his left; the interminable forest on
                  his right; and the creamy sea-sand curving in delicate tracery between. <emph>A
                     Picture</emph> and a <emph>Child</emph> of Nature! Delightedly he plunges in
                  the foam, and swims to the bald crown of a rock that uplifts itself above the
                  waves. Seating himself he gazes upon the calm expanse beyond, and swings his legs
                  against the moss that spins its filmy tendrils in the brine. Suddenly he utters a
                  cry; springs up; the blood streams from his foot. With barbarous fury he tears up
                  masses of sea moss, and with it clustering families of testacea. Dashing them down
                  upon the rock, he perceives a liquor exuding from the fragments; he<pb n="118-119"
                     xml:id="VAC6182-00000066"/> sees the white pulpy delicate morsel half hidden in
                  the cracked shell, and instinctively reaching upward, his hand finds his mouth,
                  and amidst a savage, triumphant deglutition, he murmurs—OYSTER!! Champing in his
                  uncouth fashion bits of shell and sea-weed, with uncontrollable pleasure he
                  masters this mystery of a new sensation, and not until the gray veil of night is
                  drawn over the distant waters, does he leave the rock, covered with the trophies
                  of his victory.</p>
               <p>We date from this epoch the <emph>maritime</emph> history of England. Ere long,
                  the ready cabins of her aborigines clustered upon the banks of beautiful inlets,
                  and overspread her long lines of level beaches; or penciled with delicate wreaths
                  of smoke the savage aspect of her rocky coasts. The sword was beaten into the
                  oyster-knife, and the spear into oyster rakes. Commerce spread her white wings
                  along the shores of happy Albion, and man emerged at once into civilization from a
                  nomadic state. From this people arose the mighty nation of Ostraphagi of Ancient
                  Britain came the custom of Ostracism—that is, sending political delinquents to
                  that place where they can get no more oysters.</p>
               <p>There is a strange fatality attending all discoverers. Our Briton saw a mighty
                  change come over his country—a change beyond the reach of memory or
                  speculation.—Neighboring tribes, formerly hostile, were now linked together in
                  bonds of amity. A sylvan, warlike people had become a peaceful, piscivorous
                  community; and he himself, once the lowest of his race, was now elevated above the
                     <emph>dreams</emph> of his ambition. He stood alone upon the sea-shore, looking
                  toward the rock, which, years ago, had been his stepping-stone to power, and a
                  desire to revisit it came over him. He stands now upon it. The season, the hour,
                  the westerly sky, remind him of former times. He sits and meditates. Suddenly a
                  flush of pleasure overspreads his countenance; for there just below the flood, he
                  sees a gigantic bivalve—alone—with mouth agape, as if yawning with very weariness
                  at the solitude in which it found itself. What I am about to describe may be
                  untrue. But I believe it. I have heard of the waggish propensities of oysters. I
                  have known them, from mere humor, to clap suddenly upon a rat's tail at night;
                  and, what with the squeaking and the clatter, we verily thought the devil had
                  broken loose in the cellar. Moreover, I am told upon another occasion, when a
                  demijohn of brandy had burst, a large "Blue-pointer" was found, lying in a little
                  pool of liquor, just drunk enough to be careless of consequences—opening and
                  shutting his shells with a "devil-may-care" air, as if he didn't value anybody a
                  brass farthing, but was going to be as <emph>noisy</emph> as he possibly
                  could.</p>
               <p>But to return. When our Briton saw the oyster in this defenseless attitude, he
                  knelt down, and gradually reaching his arm toward it, he suddenly thrust his
                  fingers in the aperture, and the oyster closed upon them with a spasmodic snap! In
                  vain the Briton tugged and roared;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6182-00000067"/> he
                  might as well have tried to uproot the solid rock as to move <emph>that</emph>
                  oyster! In vain he called upon his heathen gods—Gog and Magog—elder than Woden and
                  Thor; and with huge, uncouth, druidical oaths consigned all shell-fish to Nidhogg,
                  Hela, and the submarines. Bivalve held on with "a will." It was nuts for him
                  certainly. Here was a great, lubberly, chuckle-headed fellow, the destroyer of his
                  tribe, with his fingers in chancery, and the <emph>tide rising!</emph> A fellow
                  who had thought, like ancient Pistol, to make the world his oyster, and here was
                  the oyster making a world of him. Strange mutation! The poor Briton raised his
                  eyes: there were the huts of his people; he could even distinguish his own, with
                  its slender spiral of smoke; they were probably preparing a roast for him; how he
                  detested <emph>a roast!</emph> Then a thought of his wife, his little ones
                  awaiting him, tugged at his heart. The waters rose around him. He struggled,
                  screamed in his anguish; but the remorseless winds dispersed the sounds, and ere
                  the evening moon arose and flung her white radiance upon the placid waves, the
                  last billow had rolled over the FIRST OYSTER-EATER!</p>
               <p>I purpose at some future time to show the relation existing between wit and
                  oysters. It is true that Chaucer (a poet of considerable promise in the Fourteenth
                  Century) has alluded to the oyster in rather a disrespectful manner; and the
                  learned Du Bartas (following the elder Pliny) hath accused this modest bivalve of
                  "being incontinent," a charge wholly without foundation, for there is not a more
                  chaste and innocent fish in the world. But the rest of our poets have redeemed it
                  from foul aspersions in numberless passages, among which we find Shakspeare's
                  happy allusion to <q>
                     <l>"Rich <emph>honesty</emph> dwelling in a POOR house."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And no one now, I presume, will pretend to deny, that it hath been always held <q>
                     <l>"Great in mouths of wisest censure!"</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In addition to a chapter on wit and oysters, I also may make a short digression
                  touching cockles and lobsters.</p>

                  <p>"The post of Commander-in-Chief of the insurgent armies was of vital
                     importance. Yet, the man who, of all men, was fitted to fill such a post
                     adequately was at hand. The Congress knew it; and with a unanimity that rarely
                     marked their proceedings, selected George Washington—a delegate from Virginia.
                     The reader will naturally pause at the mention of a name which is regarded with
                     fond idolatry by a federation of great commonwealths; which History has
                     admitted into the company of founders of empire with Romulus and Gustavus, and
                     into the roll of great captains with Hannibal and Frederic: and which is
                     pronounced with equal veneration on the banks of the Thames and on the banks of
                     the Ganges. Both the circumstances of his birth and the circumstances of his
                     education had fitted him for the part he was called on to play. In his blood,
                     of English origin, there was blended something of the fiery valor of the
                     cavaliers of Rupert, with something of the resolute energy of the soldiers of
                     Oliver. His form, in its matchless union of vigor and grace, had foiled the
                     pencil of Stuart and the chisel of Chantry. He had known the salutary
                     discipline of early toil. With his stipend of a guinea a day as a surveyor, he
                     had acquired, in youth, the art of controlling himself. If manhood, by the
                     exercise of patriarchal dominion over thousands of acres and hundreds of
                     slaves, he had acquired the art of controlling others. Equally fortunate had
                     been his public career. He had served in the armies of the Crown, and against
                     the natives of the wilderness. He had thus learned something, both of desultory
                     and of disciplined warfare. At a later day, and on a wider theatre, his
                     knowledge of the one enabled him to surprise the Hessians at Trenton; and his
                     knowledge of the other to entangle Cornwallis in the toils of Yorktown.</p>
                  <p>"His courage was of the truest temper. Stoic savages told with wonder how he
                     alone was calm when the soldiers of Braddock were slaughtered like sheep; and
                     Continental veterans loved to narrate how his face shone with<pb n="124-125"
                        xml:id="VAC6182-00000069"/> heroic fire as he rallied the broken battalions
                     at Monmouth. His intellect was solid and comprehensive. The natural ardor of
                     his temperament was subdued by a judgment of singular accuracy and prudence.
                     His unaffected piety showed itself alike on public and on private occasions:
                     when he drew his sword at Cambridge: when he sheathed it at Annapolis: when he
                     knelt alone in the snowy solitudes of Valley Forge.</p>
                  <p>"And, indeed, all the strength of his intellect, and all the resources of his
                     character, were needed for the task he had undertaken. For he had undertaken to
                     confront the finest infantry of Europe with an army of tradesmen and
                     farmers—half clad, half fed, and wholly undisciplined. In the ranks, the spirit
                     of patriotic ardor was but too often allied with the spirit of turbulent
                     freedom. At the council board, there were officers to whom the precedence of a
                     colleague was more galling than the tyranny of the common oppressor. He had to
                     deal with deliberative bodies that acted when they should have debated, and
                     with executive bodies that debated when they should have acted; with an army
                     that murmured at his activity, and with a government that blamed his inaction;
                     and he was forced to exhibit, to both government and army, at one time the
                     reckless courage of Charles XII, and at another time the serene patience of
                     Marlborough.</p>
                  <p>"Nor must his claims to civic wisdom be passed unnoticed. His style, founded,
                     it is true, on the turgid masterpieces of that period, was accurate and
                     comprehensive. His talent for abstract speculation was not contemptible. He
                     presided with commanding wisdom over that assemblage of wise and ingenious
                     statesmen, who framed a system of government in imitation of a great system, in
                     which the centrifugal force of the separate Commonwealths and the centripetal
                     force of the Federal authority were balanced with consummate skill. Nor did he
                     exhibit less wisdom when called on to put in motion the machine which he had
                     helped to frame. He resisted the unjust rule of many men, as he had resisted
                     the unjust rule of one man; and saw with prophetic eye the issues of that
                     insane freedom that ended in the 'carmagnole' and the 'guillotine.' Nor was the
                     calm splendor of his setting unworthy of the long day of glory. He beat his
                     spear into a pruning hook; and planted choice trees, and reared rare breeds of
                     animals with the same conscientions energy, with which he had ruled armies and
                     governed cabinets.</p>
                  <p>"And yet, the truth is that characters of such perfection excite neither the
                     just, sympathy nor the just admiration of the great mass of mankind. The very
                     foibles of irregular greatness are a bond of sympathy and a source of interest.
                     Most readers will turn away from a ruler who was never unjust, and from a
                     general who never swore, to follow the amiable amours of Henry IV, or the
                     picturesque passion of Hildebrand. So, also, do the defects of imperfect
                     natures serve to render, by the force of contrast, their merits more striking.
                     The eloquence<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6182-00000070"/> of Tully stands out in
                     flaming characters against the dark background of that timorous nature; and the
                     glance of Bacon, the philosopher, seems more comprehensive when we compare it
                     with the glance of Bacon, the venal judge, lowered obliquely on a bribe. The
                     mental eye is misled, as the physical eye is misled by the ruins of Palmyra or
                     the Cathedral of Cologne. The imagination outstrips the reality, and bestows an
                     unmerited grandeur on the restored temple and the completed church. But the
                     harmonious adjustment of the mental and moral faculties of Washington, prevent
                     us, at the first glance, from duly estimating the extent of those faculties. We
                     are like the traveller who stands for the first time in that splendid structure
                     which the genius of Michael Angelo has reared for the Catholic hierarchy. He
                     cannot at once justly estimate the length of that endless nave, or the expanse
                     of that awful dome. And not until he discovers, by repeated observation, that
                     the baldaquin which covers the altar is as lofty as a palace, and that the
                     cupids that flit about the door are as big as giants, will he feel assured that
                     he treads the floor of the largest building on the earth."</p>

                  <head>THE CHARACTER OF FRANKLIN.</head>
                  <p>"The new ambassador was Benjamin Franklin, one of the foremost citizens of the
                     young Republic, and one of the foremost citizens of the older republic of
                     science. He was of humble origin. Both in Boston, the place of his birth, and
                     in Philadelphia, the place of his adoption, he had wrought at that art,
                     'preservative of all arts,' of which the followers, like ships that bear spices
                     and odors from the East, retain something of the precious cargoes they are
                     employed to distribute. The clearness of his intellect was equalled by the
                     clearness of his perceptions. Under the name of Poor Richard, and through the
                     humble medium of an 'Almanac,' he put forth a system of homely ethics, in which
                     the virtues of temperance, probity and industry were explained and commended in
                     aphorisms of ingenious terseness. Nor did he fail to practice what he preached.
                     He was speedily honored with offices of trust, both from the Colonies and the
                     Crown. And when differences, that sprang partly from criminal interference and
                     partly from criminal neglect, arose between the two countries, he exerted
                     himself strenuously, first to prevent, and then to remove those differences.
                     The hour for reconciliation passed away: and he now stood up for war with the
                     same placid courage with which he had stood out for peace. He was one of the
                     Committee that drafted the great Declaration. He was now sent to represent the
                     good cause at the Court of France, and at the bar of European opinion. An
                     extraordinary reception awaited him. He was widely and justly known as an
                     eminent man of science—as the Columbus of electrical discovery. The French
                     nation is, beyond all other nations, fond of striking effect and picturesque
                     contrast. And nothing could be more striking<pb n="128-129"
                        xml:id="VAC6182-00000071"/> king or picturesque than the spectacle now
                     presented. A Quaker diplomatist was about to appear in the most artificial of
                     courts: a new Archimedes was to come from the land of the Natchez and the
                     Mohawk: the legate of the latest republic was to recall the image of antique
                     wisdom and of antique virture—of the Grecian Solon and the Roman Regulus.
                     Haughty courtiers bent in emotion before him: brilliant beauties struggled for
                     a kiss; sculptors and painters pursued him with merciless assiduity; the
                     Academy rang with applause when Turgot's adulatory Latin described the sage as
                     one 'who had wrested the thunder from heaven and the sceptre from tyrants:' and
                     upon a ship of war, that was sent on its mission of death and destruction under
                     the desperate Paul Jones, was bestowed, with pardonable inconsistency, the name
                     of 'Poor Richard.'</p>
                  <p>"The chief glory of Franklin lies in this—that he was the greatest of the
                     pupils of Bacon. And, indeed, he was such a pupil as Bacon would have delighted
                     to honor. To both pupil and master, philosophy was not the mystic goddess of
                     Plato, or the impracticable vixen of the schoolmen. She was an angel of
                     beneficence and a minister of mercy; an Elizabeth Fry or Florence Nightingale.
                     Her mission was to relieve human suffering and to advance man's estate. And, in
                     truth, Franklin's long and successful career was a triumphant application of
                     these principles. No sooner had the electric spark glided down the kite-string
                     than the lightning-rod was invented for its innocuous descent. The maxims of
                     Poor Richard were devised not only for the household of the Quaker mechanic and
                     the dealings of the Quaker tradesman, but for the government of States and the
                     intercouse of nations. Even the barren tactics of chess were made to furnish
                     lessons for the higher warfare of life. Nor did his philosophy fail to bear her
                     fruits to the philosopher himself. The virtues of self-respect and
                     self-reliance that walked by his side, when he entered Philadelphia with a loaf
                     of bread under his arm, did not desert him when he listened, amid the frowns of
                     hostile statesmen, to the pitiless sarcasm of Weddeburne; nor when he stood,
                     the centre of universal homage, in the brilliant court of Louis.</p>
                  <p>"Zealous theologians have attacked the orthodoxy of his creed; casuists have
                     cavilled at the imperfection of his ethics. But he was doubtless a good man; he
                     was surely a great man. And he richly deserves the title of 'the most useful of
                     the children of men'—a title which Franklin himself would have prized beyond
                     all the gifts of fortune and all the laurels of fame."</p>

               </note>
               <p>THIS story is a tough one to tell, youngsters, but true it is for all that! for my
                  grandfather, from whom I have it, used always to say, when he told it: "True must
                  it be, my son, otherwise one could not tell it so at all!" And this is the way the
                  story ran:</p>
               <p>'Twas on a pleasant Sunday morning, toward harvest time, just as the buckwheat
                  blossomed. The sun had gone brightly up into the heaven; the morning wind swept
                  warm over the stubble; the larks sang in the air; the bees hummed in the
                  buckwheat; the good folk went in Sunday gear to church, and all creatures were
                  happy, and the hedgehog also.</p>
               <p>The hedgehog stood before his door with his arms folded, peeped out into the
                  morning air, and chirruped a little song to himself, just as good and just as bad
                  as a hedgehog is wont to sing on a pleasant Sunday morning. And as he was singing
                  to himself, in a cheery little voice, all at once it came into his head he might
                  just as well, while his wife was washing and dressing the children, take a little
                  walk into the field to see how his turnips were standing. Now the turnips were
                  close to his house, and he used to eat them with his family, so that he looked
                  upon them as his own. No sooner said than done. The hedgehog shut the house-door
                  to after him, and took his way to the field. He had not gone very far from the
                  house, and was about to turn, just by the thorn bush which stands there before the
                  field, near the turnip patch, when he met the hare, who had gone out on a similar
                  business, namely, to look after his cabbages. When the hedgehog caught sight of
                  the hare, he bid him a friendly "good morning!" But the hare, who, in his own way,
                  was a mighty fine gentleman, and held his head very high, answered nothing to the
                  hedgehog's greeting, but said to the hedgehog, putting on thereby a most scornful
                  mien:</p>
               <p>"How happens it, then, that thou art strolling about here in the field so early in
                  the morning?"</p>
               <p>"I'm taking a walk," said the hedgehog.</p>
               <p>"Taking a walk?" laughed the hare, "methinks thou mightest use those legs of thine
                  for better things."</p>
               <p>This answer vexed the hedgehog hugely, for he could stand almost anything, but his
                  legs he did not like to have spoken about, because they were crooked by
                  nature.</p>
               <p>"Thou thinkest, perhaps," said the hedgehog to the hare, "thou could'st do more
                  with thine own legs!"</p>
               <p>"That's what I do think," said the hare.</p>
               <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6182-00000073"/>
               <p>"That depends upon the trial," quoth the hedgehog. "I bet that if we run a race
                  together, I beat thee hollow!"</p>
               <p>"That's quite laughable, thou with thy crooked legs," said the hare, "but I've
                  nothing against it if thou art so bent upon it. What's the bet?"</p>
               <p>"A golden louis d'or and a bottle of brandy" said the hedgehog.</p>
               <p>"Done," said the hare, "fall in, and then it may come off at once."</p>
               <p>"Nay, there's no such hurry," said the hedgehog. "I'm still quite hungry; I'll go
                  home and get a bit of breakfast first; within half an hour I'll be here again on
                  the spot."</p>
               <p>With this the hedgehog went his way, for the hare was also content.</p>
               <p>On the way the hedgehog thought to himself:</p>
               <p>"The hare trusts to his long legs, but I'll fetch him for all that; he's a fine
                  gentleman to be sure, but still he's only a stupid fellow, and pay he shall!"</p>
               <p>Now when the hedgehog came to his house, he said to his wife: "Wife, dress thyself
                  in my gear, quickly, thou must go with me to the field."</p>
               <p>"What's all this about?" said his wife.</p>
               <p>"I've bet the hare a golden louis d'or and a bottle of brandy that I beat him in a
                  race, and thou must be by."</p>
               <p>"O my husband!" began the hedgehog's wife to cry, "art thou foolish? hast thou
                  then quite lost thine understanding? How canst thou wish to run a race with the
                  hare?"</p>
               <p>"Hold thy mouth, wife," said the hedgehog, "that's my business; don't meddle with
                  men's affairs. March! dress thyself in my clothes, and then come along."</p>
               <p>What could the hedgehog's wife do? She had to follow whether she would or no. When
                  they were on the way together, the hedgehog said to his wife: "Now listen to what
                  I have to say. See'st thou, on the long acre yonder will we run our races. The
                  hare runs in one furrow and I in another, and we begin to run from up there. Now
                  thou hast nothing else to do than to take thy place here in the furrow, and when
                  the hare comes up on the other side thou must call out to him: "I'm here already!"
                  With this they had reached the field; the hedgehog showed his wife her place and
                  went up the furrow. When he got to the upper end the hare was already there.</p>
               <p>"Can we start?" said the hare.</p>
               <p>'Yes, indeed!" said the hedgehog.</p>
               <p>"To it then!" and with that each placed himself in his furrow, and the hare
                  counted one, two, three! and away he went like a storm wind down the field. But
                  the hedgehog ran about three steps, and then ducked down in the furrow and sat
                  still.</p>
               <p>When the hare, on the full bound, came to the lower end of the field, the
                  hedgehog's wife, called out to him. "I'm here already!" The hare started and
                  wondered not a little; he thought not otherwise than that it was the hedgehog
                  himself that ran out to meet him; for, as every<pb n="134-135"
                     xml:id="VAC6182-00000074"/> one knows, the hedgehog's wife looks just like her
                  husband.</p>
               <p>But the hare thought: there's something wrong about all this! Another race! At it
                  again! And away he went again like a storm wind, so that his ears lay flat on his
                  head. But the hedgehog's wife staid quietly in her place. When the hare came to
                  the upper end the hedgehog called out to him, "I'm here already." But the hare,
                  beside himself with rage, cried: "Another race! at it again!"</p>
               <p>"I'm quite willing," answered the hedgehog, "just as often as thou likest."</p>
               <p>So the hare ran thee and seventy times, and the hedgehog held out to the very end
                  with him. Every time the hare came either below or above, the hedgehog or his wife
                  said "I'm here already!"</p>
               <p>But the four and seventieth time the hare came no more to the end. In the middle
                  of the field he fell to the earth and lay dead upon the spot.</p>
               <p>So the hedgehog took the louis d'or and the bottle of brandy he had won, called
                  his wife out of the furrow, and both went home together: and if they have not
                  died, they are living still. So happened it that on the Buxtehude heath the
                  hedgehog ran the hare to death, and since that time no hare has ever dreamed of
                  running a race with a Buxtehude hedgehog.</p>
               <p>But the moral of this story is, first; that no one, however high and mighty he may
                  think himself, shall let it happen to him to make merry over an humble man, even
                  if he be a hedgehog; and secondly, that it is advisable, when one marries, that he
                  take a wife out of his own condition, and who looks just like himself. He,
                  therefore that is a hedgehog, must look to it that his wife is also a hedgehog;
                  and so forth.</p>

                        <p>"First, let me talk with this philosopher. What is the cause of
                           thunder?"</p>
                     </q>
                     <bibl>—King Lear, Act III, Scene Fifth.</bibl>
                  </cit>
               </epigraph>
               <p>A SERIES of observations, and a single experiment, would throw some light upon
                  this important question. Take, for instance, a summer afternoon when the air is
                  close and sultry, and the atmosphere rarefied, when respiration is laborious, and
                  no wind stirring among the leaves. But, on the distant horizon, there are
                  indications of vapor; not rolling clouds, but thin exhalations from the earth,
                  drawn up by the heat of the sun. Suddenly this humid veil is illuminated by
                  flashes, and people call it heat lightning, summer lightning, sheet lightning. I
                  wish particularly to direct attention to the fact, that this exhibition of
                  electricity is not often accompanied with other phenomena peculiar to thunder
                  storms. No rain follows the flash, nor is any report heard; and, furthermore,
                  these illuminated vapors are always <emph>much elevated.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>It is idle to say that on account of distance from the earth the report is not
                  audible; for few persons, familiar with mountain heights, can fail to remember
                  that some time or other they were <emph>in the midst of such an atmosphere,</emph>
                  when the lightning appeared to surround them, apparently within a few feet of
                  them, flashing on every side, yet without rain or detonation. In this condition
                  the atmosphere is said to be highly charged with electricity. But surely we cannot
                  accept this as equivalent to the same meaning applied to a Leyden jar, fresh from
                  contact with the knob of the electric machine. Indeed, is not the
                     <emph>contrary</emph> very possible? Would not the data show that, in such a
                  condition the atmosphere, instead of being highly charged, had not its usual
                  percentage of electric stimulus? Experiments with the electrometer might prove
                  this supposition to be correct, and, on the other hand, it might prove it to be
                  incorrect. But one thing cannot be disproved nor denied—that air, highly rarefied
                  by heat, and <emph>humid,</emph> is air, plus water; and also that in this
                  condition air is susceptible of being silently illuminated by electricity. This
                  point being settled, we will proceed to the next—which is, "What is the cause of
                  Thunder?"</p>
               <p>The learned, down to the latest moment of going to press, have advanced no further
                  than this, that "thunder is a noise produced by THE EXPLOSION OF LIGHTNING, or
                     <emph>by the passage of lightning from one cloud to another!</emph> or from a
                  cloud to the ground." Whoever has read the celebrated treatise of John Conrad
                  Francis de Hatzfield upon the subject, will find a far more plausible theory
                  advanced by that sagacious philosopher, and quite as<pb n="138-139"
                     xml:id="VAC6182-00000076"/> amusing as the modern idea, that the sound of
                  thunder is analogous to the snap produced by holding the knuckle of one's
                  forefinger to the brass bulb of an electrical machine!—an explanation that has
                  never satisfied any reasonable mind. Let us see if there be not a rational
                  solution of the mystery.</p>
               <p>The phenomena of thunder storms are: first, heavy clouds; then lightning; then the
                  report, and then a <emph>fall of rain!</emph> Now, let us trace the consequence to
                  its source. The rain is produced by two causes, either sudden condensation of
                  watery vapors or clouds, by colder temperature, or <emph>the formation</emph> of
                  water by the action of the electric fluid. The first explains itself; the latter
                  is linked with the subject of this paper. Let us, therefore, confine ourselves to
                  that rain only which follows the thunder. Rain water is composed of two elements,
                  oxygen and hydrogen. Hydrogen is a combustible gas, and oxygen supports
                  combustion. A stream of pure hydrogen, ejected from a pipe into pure oxygen, burns
                  brightly in perfect silence. But, mixed with oxygen, it explodes upon taking fire;
                  just as a young man, having his own fortune to make, goes quietly to work until he
                  gets a partner with a tremendous capital. The relative aspects of silent lightning
                  and noisy lightning may be compared by a simple apparatus sold at any chemists; it
                  is a tin lamp filled with inflammatory gas. So long as the gas is allowed to burn
                  in small quantities it is taciturn, but, exposed to a larger mixture of oxygen, it
                  goes off with a loud report. This is a lamp that any spark of electricity can
                  ignite. And then again the product of the flame is water! The union of hydrogen
                  and oxygen is water. What meteoric phenomenon is so simple as this, that thunder
                  is caused by the electric spark uniting with rarefied air plus oxygen, and
                  rarefied vapor plus hydrogen, detonating, recompounding, and forming rain!</p>

                  the legs and side-bones to be eaten only; the leg not to be cut in two; take it

                  small glass of Curaçao, and a siesta, during which you will dream of the beauties
                  of the dinner to come.</p>
               <p>Each course of such a breakfast must be served only at the time the cook is ready;

               <p>WHOEVER has been in Havana must needs recollect the little brazier, with its ball
                  of white ashes, beneath which a live hard-wood coal, called a "<foreign
                     xml:lang="SPA">candela,</foreign>" glows all day for the accommodation of
                  smokers in every house. This we thought once a dainty device. But our friend,
                  Master Karl, has given us some new, delicate and fragrant suggestions:—</p>
               <p>"It is an established canon that the purest and most elevated <emph>tastes</emph>
                  or flavors are unmixed—simple. I respectfully submit that in smoking tobacco, this
                  rule by no means holds good.</p>
               <p>And here I might cite the learned <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Winstruphius</foreign>
                  who in his 'Epigrammata,' puns so learnedly on Bacchus and To-Bacco, and their
                  mutual flavoring influence. This I spare you. Likewise the lucubrations of <hi
                     rend="i"/>Schioppius Dunderhedius, who in speaking most horrifically, <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">De odore fetida tobacci,</foreign> distinctly analyzes it into
                  two smells—one infernal, the other diabolical. This spared also, (by request).</p>
               <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6182-00000079"/>
               <p>"But I mean simply to say that a <emph>point</emph> may be given to a good cigar
                  by lighting it from wood—not from the timber of a lucifer match, but from a
                  smoldering, smoking fragment of a log, either hickory, oak, or even pine. And note
                  ye, good fellows all, that the earlier in the season this is done, the more
                  delicate is the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">goût;</foreign> yea, this rule holds so
                  far good, that on the first crisp evenings in September, no musk-rose or violet
                  that is—nay, no vitivert—nay, no ess bouquet—nay, no florimel, nay, no eau de
                  cypre—nay, no hediosmya—nay, no daintily-ambered <foreign xml:lang="LAT">aqua
                     coloniæ</foreign> or any Paradisaical sweets that be, can surpass the <hi
                     rend="i"/>odorat of the first whiff of a wood-lighted cigar.</p>
               <p>"Yea, and more. If you smoke light, and mild, and dry, preferring Latikéa and
                  Knaster to fine-cut, tumback and chopped cavendish, there is a class of
                  perfumes—that I ween, which Piesse places as the third note in the gamut of good
                  smells—a certain spicy oriental class, such as cascarrilla, or a faint admixture
                  of santal, which perfumes the axe which lays it low, which in no wise detracts
                  from piping joys. And I tell you in all truth, that Virginia leaf, with these
                  sweet delights, and with sumach or kinni kinnick therein gently mingled, spreads
                  around such a pastilled, ecclesiastical cathedral air, blended with dim souvenirs
                  of the rue Bréda, that he who smokes thereof is oftentimes in tone to sing the
                  high song of King Solomon, or the lyrics of the Persian land, wherein love and
                  devotion are so curiously entwined twined, that no sensation that is, can be
                  compared thereto, unless it be the kissing of your sweetheart during sermon-time
                  under the lee of a high-backed old-fashioned pew. <q>

               <p>THE author of the following two communications, written seven years ago, in now
                  revising them, finds melancholy thoughts taking the place of the gay and festive
                  feelings in which they were originally composed. In those seven years of civil
                  strife which brought sorrow to the hearts of thousands, whose loved ones, whose
                  "beautiful and brave," fell in the battle-field, death did not spare some of the
                  best and noblest of those who were sportively mentioned in these papers.</p>
               <p>Dr. Francis has passed away—Dr. Francis the jovial, the kindhearted, the man of
                  boundless curiosity and unerring memory, of large and sound acquirements, the
                  genuine and enthusiastic New Yorker, who has preserved the choicest memorials of
                  the men of the last generation in that city to which he himself so long gladdened
                  and instructed.</p>
               <p>President Felton, of Harvard University, is no more. New York, still mourns the
                  death of one of her most eminent surgeons, Dr. John Watson.</p>
               <p>The memory of all men of professional excellence, however high it may have been,
                  is proverbially brief. <q>
                     <l>"Feeble tradition is their memory's guard."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the fame of the distinguished skill of Watson must soon fade away, like that
                  of Kissam, of Wright, of Post, and even within a few years that of Mott. But the
                  memory of Dr. Watson will be preserved by his volume on "The Medical Profession in
                  Ancient Times," a book equally agreeable and impressive, very learned, yet very
                  original. That memory will also be preserved and cherished among a limited but
                  very select class of students, in law, in medicine and in intellectual science, by
                  his elaborate, acute and exhaustive printed opinions as a medical expert; in the
                  great, the genial, the liberal, the wise, the accomplished scholar, one of whose
                  Homeric criticisms is specially combated in these papers, who is there described
                  as a person of the highest scholarship, armed with the authority, and clothed with
                  the dignity of Jupiter, he, too, was soon suddenly snatched away from the station
                  he adorned, and the studies which he loved.</p>
               <p>To those honored names must I add that of Thackeray. He was one well known
                  familiarly in our American cities, and there are still hundreds who quote his
                  criticisms on our "Big Bursts of Oysters," as well as on our old Maderia, so
                  plentiful and so prized but twenty years ago, while the portraits of Col. Newcome,
                  of Becky Sharpe, and many more, remain, life-like in the minds of thousands.</p>
               <p>But such recollections will touch and sadden only some few of my older readers.
                  The passages relating to the lamented dead, have been therefore left unaltered, in
                  the wish to give to such of any younger generation who may casually look into this
                  book, a passing glance at the pursuits and opinions of some of the noted literary
                  men among us in 1860.</p>

                  <p>MY DEAR COZZENS:—I had hoped to spend my vacation in quiet idleness, with a
                     rigorous and religious abstinence<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6182-00000081"/>
                     from pen and ink. But I cannot refuse to comply with the request you urge so
                     eloquently, placing your claim to my assistance not only on the ground of old
                     friendship, but also as involving important objects, literary and scientific,
                     as well as social and commercial; all of them (to repeat your phrase and
                     Bacon's), "coming home to the business and bosoms of men."</p>
                  <p>You desire me to inform you, after careful examination of all the authorities,
                     "whether the ancient Greeks or Romans, during the classic ages, were acquainted
                     with champagne."</p>
                  <p>In such an inquiry, at once scientific and classical, it is all-important that
                     the question should be stated with logical precision. Bacon himself has taught
                     us that the judicious statement of the question (<foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                        >prudens interrogatio</foreign>) is one half the way to scientific
                     discovery.</p>
                  <p>Now, I may safely presume that you do not mean to ask whether the territory of
                     Champagne was known to the ancients. Any Freshman can tell you that the fair
                     land on each side of the murmuring Marne, and up the vine-clad sides of the
                     mountains, was part of ancient Gaul, known and subject to the Romans, and
                     designated as part of different provinces at different periods of the Roman
                     sway.</p>
                  <p>On this point and all relating to it you can get whatever information you
                     desire from Cluverius and D'Anville, or the Fathers of Trevoux. But this, I
                     take it, you cannot mean, though it is the literal sense of your request.</p>
                  <p>Nor, in my judgment, can you mean to ask, whether the Greeks and Romans were
                     acquainted with the wines of the growth of that part of old Gaul which, under
                     the ancient regime of France, was called the province of Champagne. Of course
                     the Roman colonists in Gaul knew and used the wines therein grown and made; but
                     from the account given by the elder Pliny, of the wines there produced, they
                     bore little resemblance to the present wines of Champagne, whether <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">mousseux crémant,</foreign> or still. They are not named with
                     any respect in Pliny's statement of the one hundred and ninety-five (195!)
                     sorts of wine which in his day were counted fit for the Roman market, of which
                     only eighty kinds were admitted to be "wines of authority for good
                     tables"—"quibus auctoritas fuerit mensâ," as he says, unless I misquote him.
                     The art of wine-making was then in its very infancy in Gaul. Indeed, it was not
                     until the days of the great and good Ingulphus, the Seventeenth mitred Abbot of
                     Verzeney, who was also Dean of Rheims—(I give that great man the titles by
                     which he was known in the last forty years of his life, although his most
                     admirable and important inventions and improvements in the making and
                     management of wines were made whilst he was still only curé of Verzy on the
                     mountains, and afterwards Archdeacon of Ay, in the low country along the
                     Marne)—I say, that it was not until the days of the aforesaid Ingulphus
                        (<foreign xml:lang="LAT">supradicti Reverendissimi</foreign> Ingulphi as the
                        <title>Rheims Chronicle</title> styles him), that the wines of Campagne
                        attracted<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6182-00000082"/> tracted the attention
                     of Royalty. Soon after that they became the constant accompaniments, <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">de rigueur,</foreign> of all "good men's feasts." I write, as
                     you know, out of reach of my own library, as well as of that of our university,
                     and must trust altogether to memory. Otherwise I could not resist the
                     temptation of expatiating further in the praise of this great benefactor of
                     humanity. I will only add that the great Ingulphus of whom I speak, and to whom
                     we all owe such an <foreign xml:lang="FRA">impayable</foreign> debt of
                     gratitude, was the one of the Rohan family, and must not be confounded with the
                     three other very able and distinguished men of the Latinized name of Ingulphus,
                     or Ingulphius, (for the name is spelled both ways), who figure in public
                     affairs in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.</p>
                  <p>The great Ingulphus prosecuted his vinous experiments and effected his
                     discoveries during the reign of the famous Philip Augustus; or rather, Philip
                     Augustus reigned in France during his time, which, by a very noteworthy
                     coincidence, was the very period when, according to the best Irish antiquaries
                     their Milesian forefathers discovered and perfected the manufacture of whisky,
                        <foreign xml:lang="GAE">usky,</foreign> or <emph>the</emph> water, as it was
                     called in the ancient tongue of the Emerald Isle; though in the cognate dialect
                     of the Scotch Gaelic, it was known as <foreign xml:lang="GAI">uisgee.</foreign>
                     These epochs also corresponded with the date when Magna Charta, the palladium
                     of England's liberty, was wrung by the English from their reluctant monarch. No
                     sound philosopher can suppose that coincidences like these are accidental. No,
                     no: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,</l>
                           <l>Than are dreamt of in your philosophy."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, to return to your inquiry. Having, by the process of philosophical
                     elimination, excluded much vagueness and danger of error, I proceed to reduce
                     your inquiry to the shape of the <emph>prudent interrogation,</emph> the
                     logically exact questioning, of the school of Bacon and Newton. Your inquiry,
                     then, must be this. Did the ancients, in the high and palmy days of their
                     eloquence, philosophy and poetry, either in Greece or Rome, or in both, know
                     and use (and of course become fond of) any effervescent wine or wines having
                     the chemical qualities, as carbonic acid gas, with the tartarous and saccharine
                     constituents, the physiological and dietetic qualities, <emph>aroma,
                        bouquet,</emph> etc., together with those other properties either belonging
                     to the science of the laboratory or to that of the table, which have been so
                     beautifully stated by my good friend Dr. Mülder, Professor of Dietetic
                     Chemistry in the University of Utrecht, in his "Chemistry of Wines," as being
                     essential to the true wines of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Champagne,</foreign>
                     whether mousseux or <foreign xml:lang="FRA">demi-mousseux?</foreign>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this statement of the question, you see, I purposely exclude the <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">vin non-mousseux,</foreign> or what is less philosophically
                     expressed in English by the name of "<emph>still</emph> Champagne." This I do
                     because in the vulgar and popular use, such wines<pb n="152-153"
                        xml:id="VAC6182-00000083"/> are not included under the term Champagne,
                     although grown and made in that District, and some of them, as Sillery, of the
                     very highest merit, gastronomic and dietetic, convivial, social, and moral, and
                     especially in those qualities which the physiology of the table designates as
                        <hi rend="i"/>Oxyporian.</p>
                  <p>Thus, I think that the preliminary question is clearly settled with an
                     Aristotelian precision, such as the learned gentlemen who discuss questions of
                     Contagion and Infection in academies and conventions would do well to imitate.
                     I then proceed to the investigation itself. This I am not ashamed to affirm
                     that I do with perfect confidence in the successful result; for I do it, not
                     like my learned friends just mentioned. <q>
                        <l>"Cæca regens filo vestigia."</l>
                     </q> Or, as it is translated in my new version of Virgil, (now on the press of
                     Ticknor &amp; Fields)— <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"With stumbling steps along the dubious maze,</l>
                           <l>Tracing with half-seen thread the darksome ways."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> But with a bold and firm step, lifting high the blazing torch of classic
                     lore, which pours its floods of light forward in my path.</p>
                  <p>The conclusion to which I come is simply that the Greek and Roman gentlemen and
                     scholars, in the high and palmy state of their literature and art, had used and
                     enjoyed wines similar to the effervescent, foaming, sparkling, or creaming
                     wines of Champagne.</p>
                  <p>I have stated the precise question, and the conclusion to which my mind has
                     logically arrived.</p>
                  <p>It would be descending not a little from the dignity of learning to
                     recapitulate any of the steps by which that conclusion was attained, and the
                     various authorities on which it rests.</p>
                  <p>It is a wise general rule never to give such reasons for your opinions. Let
                     those who ask your opinion be satisfied when they have got it. Yet, considering
                     the great importance of the present inquiry, and the intense interest which it
                     must excite, I will deviate from my ordinary practice.</p>
                  <p>Before stating this evidence, it must be observed, once for all, that though I
                     hold that a sparkling wine similar to our best Champagne <emph>was</emph> known
                     to the ancients, it is quite as clear that such was not a common characteristic
                     of their wines. The resemblance was only of some of their choice vintages to
                     those of our Champagnes. Otherwise, their wines were commonly still, strong,
                     and often thick, like our "Essence Tokay." I do not care to trouble you with
                     any learning on this head. It would be too large a dose for the present.</p>
                  <p>On all similar questions as to Grecian habits and Greek learning, the best and
                     most universal authority is Athenæus. He is the most delightful and instructive
                     author on matters of the table in any language, being to Greek literature a Dr.
                     Kitchener of a higher order, or rather his work is what Brillat-Savarin's
                     "Physiologie du Goût is in French;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6182-00000084"/>
                     but it is of far more value than Savarin's, because, with equal sprightliness
                     and familiar knowledge of the subject that he handles, his book is filled,
                     crammed, stuffed, spiced, larded with choice extracts from numerous Greek poets
                     and dramatists, whose other writings are all lost.</p>
                  <p>I always make Athenæus my summer travelling companion—in the original, of
                     course; and I prefer reading him in Schweighauser's last edition, partly
                     because it is the best, but chiefly because old Schweighauser was exceedingly
                     kind to me at Strasbourg, more years ago than I care to tell. But as I know
                     that your Greek is exceedingly rusty, <emph>you</emph> may consult Athenæus
                     with profit and pleasure in Bohn's edition of Yonge's literal translation. I
                     looked into it not long ago, and found that I could understand it nearly or
                     quite as well as the original, which is more than I can say for most of the
                     translations which our college lads use for "ponies."</p>
                  <p>Amongst an infinite number of delicious excerpts from Greek poets as popular in
                     their day as Beranger is in our own, but of whom nothing remains to posterity
                     but exquisite fragments, he quotes a long passage from Critias, who thus begins
                     a poem which, by the way, is palpably the model of the well-known lines of
                     Goethe, and of Byron who is thought to have borrowed from him. Yet as Byronknew
                     much more Greek than he did German, I have no doubt that both he and Goethe
                     copied directly from the old Greek. Byron has it thus: <q>
                        <l>"Know you the land of the cypress and myrtle?"</l>
                     </q> Critias, addressing his native land of Sicily, says: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Hail to the land of the dim Proserpine!</l>

                     everffescent, frothing wine?</p>
                  <p>Again, Athenæus quotes various passages from Alexis, who seems to have been a
                     Lesbian Tom Moore, for he luxuriates over "the rich and rosy wine" of the
                     island of Lesbos, and thus addresses Bacchus on this wine: <q>

                        </lg>
                     </q> Can there be any reasonable doubt that the "sparkling ruby wine," with its
                     proper concomitant, "the floating out of old Care" from the place where he had
                     long nestled in gloomy security, all allude to a choice, effervescing, red
                     wine, precisely of the quality of an excellent <foreign xml:lang="FRA">vin rosé

                  </p>
                  <p>Then gushes forth a torrent of quotations out of the inexhaustable memory of
                     this philosopher of good suppers, from the poet Hermippus, who seems a
                     cosmopolitan sort of a bard, and writes as if he were at home over all the
                     known world. Complimenting other wines, for which he had unquestionably a right
                     liberal and Catholic faith,<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6182-00000085"/> the poet
                     after praising the "Thasian's mild perfume," bursts into admiration of <q>

                           <l>—"The bloom that mantles high</l>

                  </p>

                        >demi-mousseux,</foreign> and there are clear indications (in the original,
                     at least) of the golden color of some of these sparkling vintages, and the
                     roseate tinge of others.</p>
                  <p>By the way, there is another ancient usage of which Athenæus has preserved the
                     memory together with that, dozens of authers where very names would have been
                     swept into oblivion with their poems, their songs, ballads, their comedies
                     which were once the charm of the civilized world had it not been for the
                     inexhaustible memory of this most catholic of quoters. The fact may not be
                     conclusive, but it is at least corroborative of the opinion I maintain.</p>
                  <p>It is that the Greeks were accustomed to cool their wines even by
                        <emph>snow,</emph> as they were not blest with our ice houses. What is this
                     but an anticipation of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Vin de Champagne
                        Frappe</foreign> of our modern tables.</p>
                  <p>I must content myself with only one more authority from this source. Athenæus
                     himself, in his sober, prose speculations, says (Lib. 1, § 59) of a certain
                     wine; "This kind is a wine which has a tendency to mount upward."</p>
                  <p>Now, with all deference to my old friend Schweighauser (who quite overlooks the
                     point), how can any of the above passages be explained without understanding
                     them to refer to wines resembling our sparkling Champagne?</p>
                  <p>If I thought that you could read Greek with any sort of facility, I should not
                     have troubled you with the above imperfect but not unfaithful versions of these
                     precious fragments. They are more faithful than those of Bohn's translation, if
                     not more poetical; yet, like his, they are far from expressing the force and
                     truth of the original. In reading aloud these exquisite fragments in their
                     native Greek, I hear the whizzing burst of the exploded cork, I see the foaming
                     froth of the goblet, I scent the flowery perfume of its delicate <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">bouquet.</foreign>
                  </p>
                  <p>These and other authorities in Athenæus and the bright dramatists and poets
                     whose gems the philosopher has preserved in his sober prose, like pearls in
                     amber, are quite sufficient for my argument as to the Greek. When I get home
                     among my books, I am sure that I can fortify these authorities by many passages
                     to the same effect, from Plato, Aristotle, Ptolemæus, Hippocrates and St.
                     Chrysostom.</p>
                  <p>Yet there is one other authority not to be omitted in such a discussion. It is
                     even that of old Homer himself. In some thirty or more passages he paints his
                     gods or heroes gazing upon the angry sea, to which he gives the epithet
                        <foreign xml:lang="GRC">οινοψ</foreign>, literally "wine-faced." The
                     translators and commentators tell us that the compound word means "dark," or
                     "ruddy," like the wine of that age. What stupidity! Is it not clear that it
                     refers to the foam-covered<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6182-00000086"/> covered
                     deep—that it paints the angry main with its whole surface instinct with life,
                     and mantling and foaming like the best foaming wine of the times—probably like
                     that "Chian wine," that the poetic fragments in Athenæus tells us was Homer's
                     favorite brand. In brief, the only translation which can convey the force of
                     the epithet to a modern is the "Champagne-like deep" It is possible to describe
                     more happily the "foam-faced sea," the <foreign xml:lang="GRC">οινοπα
                        ποngr;ςον</foreign> on which Achilles gazes, and calls forth his sea-born
                     mother, in the beginning of the Epic story. How admirably does this harmonize
                     with the wild spirit of the hero, and the stormy tale of his wrath and his
                     glory. It becomes nearly as flat as the leavings of yesterday's uncorked
                     Champagne, if this glowing epithet is reduced to "dark," or "ruddy," or even to
                     "claret-colored,"—which last would be at least more poetical, though not more
                     acurate.</p>
                  <p>Next, then, for the Romans. That a delicate <foreign xml:lang="FRA">vin
                        mousseux petillant,</foreign> a foaming and sparkling wine, was familiar to
                     the tastes of the refined gentlemen of Rome in the time of Mæcenas and his
                     little senate of poets, and soldiers, and philosophers, we need no better proof
                     than the testimony of Virgil himself, who graphically represents the drinking
                     of just such a wine as that with which you oblige your friends at various
                     prices, and under sundry brands but all choice and dear. I take first the
                     literal meaning of Virgil melodious verses, though I have long thought that
                     those contained a deeper secondary and recondite sense, referring to the
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">recherché</foreign> repasts of Virgil's great friend
                     and patron, Mæcenas. It is in the close of the first book of the Æneid, in the
                     recital of Dido's royal bonquet to the Trojan chief. Toward the end of the
                     feast, Dido is described as ordering, and receiving, and filling with wine, the
                     hereditary massive goblet of gold and gems, used by her progenitor Belus, and
                     the long line of her ancestors, <q>

                     the giver of mirth, and of the gracious Juno, next she pours on the table the

                     have given the sense of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">impiger</foreign> with such
                     precision), drained off the foaming cup, and bathed himself in the overflowing
                     gold." Here, again, so far as I can remember, no one of the translators or
                     commentators—I have examined all of them in my time, though not very lately—has
                     given the full force of the "<foreign xml:lang="LAT">pleno se proluit
                        auro,</foreign>" for though it implies that this inexpert drinker drenched
                     himself with the choice liquor contained in the golden goblet, it also
                     unquestionably means that he bathed his face in that vinous spray with which
                     frothing Champagne often moistens or even bathes the face of the hasty and
                     ill-mannered drinker. Good Abbé De Lille, better accustomed to the pleasures of
                     Champagne than the port-drinking English translators and the beer-loving German
                     commentators, comes much nearer in his <q>

                     translation, which, as I have announced at least twice before, is now in
                     press.</p>
                  <p>Here, then, I may triumphantly rest my argument. Yet I cannot refrain from
                     adding what is probably known to very few scholars out of Italy. It is this;
                     Cardinal Mai, whose services to learning have entitled him to the lasting
                     gratitude of all scholars, discovered, eighteen months ago, among the hitherto
                     unexplored treasures of the Vatican library, a manuscript, as yet unprinted,
                     containing the Æneid with the notes of an anonymous old commentator or
                     scholiast, evidently nearly contemporary with the poet, or at least of the very
                     next generation to him, full of curious criticism and still more curious facts.
                     This old scholiast, in his note on the very passage just under consideration,
                     confirms a conjecture of my own, which I communicated in a paper of mine to the
                     "London Classical Journal" some twelve years ago or more. He expressly says
                     that this passage was meant to be understood in its literal sense by ordinary
                     readers and by posterity, but that it also referred, in its interior or
                     esoteric sense, to the habits of Mæcenas at his festive board, where Horace,
                     Pollio, Varrus and Virgil were in the habit of dining with him twice every
                     week, not including his birthday parties and other high festivities. On these
                     occasions those favorite guests were always treated with a certain foaming wine
                     of the "Dido brand"—"<foreign xml:lang="LAT">vino effervescent, spumanteque,
                        amphoris notâ Didonis signatis.</foreign>"</p>
                  <p>He adds, also, that this wine was always supplied for the table of Mæcenas from
                     the wine-vaults of Sulpicius, "<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Sulpicianis
                        horreis,</foreign>" the same eminent wine-merchant whose stock is mentioned
                     with great reverence by Horace in one of his odes.</p>
                  <p>As far as I can make out the topography of old Rome, Sulpicius had his chief
                     commercial establishment in Curtius street, nearly opposite to the first city
                     station of the great Appian Way, the Hudson River Railroad of<pb n="162-163"
                        xml:id="VAC6182-00000088"/> old Rome, a locatity not very unlike yours in
                     your own city.</p>
                  <p>I trust that you are now quite satisfied that the gentlemen of Greece and Rome
                     were accustomed to quaff a generous and pure <foreign xml:lang="FRA">vin
                        mousseaux,</foreign> quite like, and in no way inferior to the best
                     Champagne of our times. I trust, also, that you will have ambition and
                     patriotism enough to make the resemblance between old imperial Rome and your
                     commercial Rome still more perfect by arranging with your correspondents at
                     Rheims or at Cincinnati to supply you with a DIDO brand of the very choicest

                  <p>By the way, why does not the doctor, in his capacity of the Herodotus of your
                     local history, amongst the fossil remains of the last century which he has
                     dishumed, make out to dig up some choice reminiscences (there must have been
                     much material for such) of the long residence of Brileat-Savarin in New York
                     between sixty and seventy years ago. I was exceedingly interested with the
                     account of him related by Mr. —— in my visit to the Century Club, with you the
                     last time I was in your city. That the immortal author of the great work on
                     Transcendental Gastronomy should have lived for some years in New York, by

                     moreover, a Judge of the Court of Cassation, the highest tribunal of France,
                     promoted to that high station by the discriminating Napoleon, and continued by
                     the Bourbons, is as whimsical and as surprising a vicissitude of fortune as any
                     of the incidents in the life of Louis Philippe or of Louis Napoleon. I must
                     unquestionably have seen him more than once in former days, at the Court of
                     Cassation, seated by the side of his venerable chief, the Legitimist <foreign

               <p>UP the Rhine in the leafy month of June, one might go further and fare worse,
                  especially with regard to wine. The fact is, it is a noble thing to find some good
                  in one's surroundings. To pass serenely and quietly from Claret, Burgundy and
                  Champagne to Schiedam Schnapps and thence to Johannesberger, Marcobrunner,
                  Rüdesheimer, and even Piesporter, without a groan. To take a glass of Completer at
                  Coire or allay thirst by Vin de Glacier, Yvorne, or St. Georges, through the land
                  of snow-capped mountains and yodles; thence descending to d'Asti, Barbera,
                  Campidano di Lombardi, Canonae del Sardegna, Monte Fiascone, Orvietto and Lagrima
                  Christi; drinking Aguardiente, Sherry and Val de Penas in Spain, coming down to
                  Bouza in Cairo or Mahayah in Morocco, pitching into Vodke or Kisslyschtxhy in
                  Russia. Behold, QUO DUCIT GULA!</p>
               <p>Perhaps, for euphony, it is the best way to sum up German wines under the headings
                  Rhine wine, Moselle wine or the popular hock; for what Anglo-Saxon head<pb
                     n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6182-00000090"/> can always recall even a few names like
                  Augenscheimer, Assmannhaüser, Affenthaler, Bacharach, Brauneberger, Bischeimer,
                  Bessingheimer, Bodenheimer, Bechebacher, Berncasther, Deidesheimer, Epsteiner,
                  Euchariusberger, Geissenheimer, Graacher, Grüenhauser, Hochheimer, Hinterhaus,
                  Johannesberger, Liebfrauenmilch, Laubenheimer, Liestener, Mittelheimer,
                  Marcobrunner, Niersteiner, Oppenheimer, Pitcher, Rüdesheimer, Rauenthaler,
                  Schamet, Steinberger, Steinwein, Schiersteiner, Thiergartner, Walporger and
                  Zeltingener?</p>
               <p>It is a popular fallacy to suppose good German wines are acid; they are dry, fine
                  flavored, and keep better than the five hundred year immortality of an oil
                  painting. As for the alcohol in them, by a careful analysis, Hochheimer showed
                  only 14.37 per cent, of pure alcohol, while a very old sample, only marked 8.8, a
                  lower figure than almost any of the French wines.</p>
               <p>Johannesberger from the Schloss, is the king of German wines; twenty-five years
                  ago, Mumm and Giesler of Cologne and Johannesberg, held the vintage of 1822 at the
                  rate of $10 per gallon; at compound interest it would now be worth about $60 per
                  gallon! This wine with Steinberger, Geissenheimer and Hochheimer, have the most
                  delicate flavor and aroma of all German wines. The warmest seasons insure the best
                  vintages, so those of 1748, 1766,1779,1783,1800,1802 and 1811 were celebrated
                  among the past generation as we now look to 1834, 1839, 1842 and 1846. Pure air
                  and plenty of sunlight light are the best guardians for vines, and those crowning
                  the high lands yield wine of the best body, while those in the low lands are
                  poorer, and the wine requires years to attain a really fine flavor. Next to
                  Johannesberger comes Steinberger of the Duke of Nassau, the iron hand in a velvet
                  glove, delicate as a zephyr, it has the strength of a hurricane; kiss the beauty,
                  but don't arouse the virago. <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Hercules viraginem
                     vicit,</foreign> but every one is not a "Dutchman!"</p>
               <p>There is something very attractive in Liebfrauenmilch; the best comes from Worms,
                  it has a good body and should be drunk reflectively, this milk for babes. While
                  Marcobrunner, Rudesheimer and Niersteiner are for arms and the sword song of
                  Körner.</p>
               <p>Brauneberger ranks first among Moselle wines, and according to young Germany,
                  there is not a headache in a hogshead of it; certainly after two bottles of it,
                  there was no <foreign xml:lang="DEU">kazenjammer</foreign> next morning. The old
                  story that Bacchus, when he lived in the Father-land, having invited Jupiter down
                  stairs to make a night of it on Brauneberger, so pleased the latter with this
                  tipple, that he at once ordered all he could buy, on credit, for Olympus, to take
                  the place of nectar, for a change; may be true. When you go to Heidelburg, stop at
                  the Black Eagle Hotel, and ask Herr Lehr, the landlord, for a bottle of Sparkling
                  White Moselle; drink it in the courtyard under the vine leaves, and to the sound
                  of that fountain where the large trouts swim!</p>
               <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6182-00000091"/>
               <p>To look forward for ten years to seeing a cellar and then have it turn out a
                  "sell," is one of the agonies of travel. Possibly under other circumstances,
                  Auerbach's cellar in Leipsic would have worn less the air of a shows shop, or less
                  like Julius Cæsar in peg-tops and a stove-pipe hat than I found it, but not even a
                  bottle of Hoch-heimer—those paintings on the wall representing Faust's appearance
                  and disappearance, and the old admonition of 1525: <q>
                     <l>"VIVE, BIBE, OBREGARE, MEMOR," etc.</l>
                  </q> could bring up anything ideal—so I left. At Mayence I was more favored, and
                  though the scene comes up through several glasses dimly, at least the attempt can
                  be made to describe an old-fashioned cellar, where travelling English don't ask
                  "for that table, ah, he bored the holes in, you know. Faust, I mean. Three wax
                  stoppers, and all that sort of thing?" "Haven't got it, sir!" answers the <foreign
                     xml:lang="DEU">kellner.</foreign> "Then why the—don't you make one!" says
                  despairing England.</p>
               <p>On the steamer from Coblentz, I formed the acquaintance of an officer, a
                  lieutenant, who was just off duty from Ehrenbreitstein, and was on his way to
                  Frankfort. Arriving after sunset, we determined to stay that night at Mayence, and
                  go on next morning by railroad to Frankfort. After dinner at the hotel, we
                  strolled out to look around town, and finally, as we crossed a narrow street, he
                  proposed a bottle of Brauneberger in a cellar on the opposite side of the way, a
                  quiet old nest, he said, where only old-fashioned and well-to-do Mayenzers were to
                  be found. Down we went, and passing through an anteroom, where a fine specimen of
                  a broad-shouldered middle-aged German was talking with a spectacled old gentleman
                  with the air of a Professor, in a land where Professors are something; we were
                  passing on to the next cellar, when the broad-shouldered landlord, bowing with
                  great respect, saluted my companion with a string of titles as long as a roll of
                  sausages. Upon which the Herr Professor, for such he was, lifted his hat politely
                  to us, and, salutations over, we entered the next cellar attended by the
                  landlord.</p>
               <p>"Altmayer," said the officer, turning to him, "a bottle of <emph>that</emph>
                  Brauneberger." And duly and deliberately the portly <foreign xml:lang="DEU"
                     >wirth</foreign> departed, soon returning with the Moselle Nectar and glasses.
                  If Hasenclever has not visited that cellar, he has sketched its match in some
                  quaint old German city, for there it was, an interior worth crossing three oceans
                  to sit in and drink Moselle or Rhine wine. The low ceiling was spanned with
                  groined arches, dusky with age, not dark, as the <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >olla</foreign> color of Murillo, but a light-brown coffee-color, with a dash
                  of light, borrowed from the lamp that hung in the centre of the cellar, and whose
                  light just penetrated to the great butts lining the walls. The round table at
                  which we were seated was of oak, dark with age, and anything more beautiful in the
                  way of the light that shone through our brimming glasses of Brauneberger, and was
                  reflected on that dark<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6182-00000092"/> oak, I have
                  never seen. The <foreign xml:lang="DEU">wirth</foreign> having returned to the
                  ante-room, my companion, evidently pleased with the interest I took in the
                  surroundings of the cellar, judiciously kept silence until I had thoroughly viewed
                  it all, sipping slowly the delicate wine, and wondering how all the sunlight got
                  into the cellar at night. There was positively a thin golden cloud all around us,
                  and such serene repose as a traveller who has been through a dozen galleries of
                  paintings, innumerable churches, etc., all in one day, believes to be the height
                  of pleasure, i. e., KHEYF!</p>
               <p>"I am very glad we came here," said the lieutenant, "for I see you can appreciate
                  what I have always thought one of the most picturesque wine cellars in this part
                  of Germany. Have you noticed the grotesque carving on that door leading to the
                  further cellar?" Turning my head in the direction indicated, I noticed a pointed
                  arch doorway, surrounded with the most beautiful gothic tracery leaves, birds,
                  monkeys, grapes, curious grinning heads, all cut in stone, while the oak panels of
                  the door were rich in carved flowers and leaves.</p>
               <p>"The oak door," said the lieutenant, "is a modern addition of the <foreign
                     xml:lang="DEU">wirth's,</foreign> but the rest runs back to the 16th century."
                  While I was still looking at the curious carving round the door, three or four
                  middle-aged gentlemen, together with the spectacled Professor, entered the cellar,
                  and after polite salutations, drew up to the table, and the <foreign
                     xml:lang="DEU">wirth</foreign> soon appeared with bottles and glasses for the
                  different private guests, for in such light they all appeared and acted. Having a
                  cigar case well stocked with a supply of Partagas <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >primeras,</foreign> it went the rounds, and the cigars were accepted after
                  much urging on my part, for the idea is not German; I had the satisfaction of
                  reaping an amount of gratified expressions from each smoker that paid me for the
                  sacrifice; for I had nursed the few I brought with me from the States with great
                  care. Conversation flowed on easily, and the second bottle of Brauneberger went
                  the way of the first; it was even better nectar than its leader. The light in the
                  cellar appeared brighter and brighter, the golden cloud seemed filled with
                  bees-wings humming, the great butts looming out of the mellow light looked like
                  brown Franciscans making merry over a bottle of <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                     >sambuca.</foreign> The spectacled Professor told a right good story two feet
                  broad, the other elderly gentlemen kept it up! The lieutenant ordered a third
                  bottle of Brauneberger, which was better than its predecessors.</p>
               <p>Then there came in a wandering violin-player, blind as a bat, and a very pretty
                  girl with a guitar, who was not blind, as her bright eyes, shining on the handsome
                  lieutenant, plainly told, and when she sung that pretty song of "Frau Nachtigal,"
                  it appeared to me, after the wine, that she accented those lines— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Wer du bist, der bin auch ich,</l>
                        <l>|:Drum lass nach—zu lieben mich":|</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6182-00000093"/> and regarded the lieutenant in the
                  adoring style, permitting, at some future time, any amount of <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">poussir</foreign>ing, as the Germans have it. Then we ordered
                  just one more bottle of Brauneberger, and the lieutenant, taking the guitar from
                  the pretty girl, sung in a fine, baritone voice, "Soldatenleben"— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">

                     </lg>
                  </q> and the old gentlemen joined in the "Valleri, vallera, vallera!" chorus with
                  hearty good will and <foreign xml:lang="DEU">kreutz fidélely!</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>Several glasses of wine were bestowed on the blind violinist, a collection made
                  for the pretty girl, who assured the lieutenant her name was Aennchen von Tharau,
                  which he doubted, insisting on it that Aennchen died in 1659, and lived in Himmel
                  Strasse! But she gave us a parting song, prettily sung, and floated off into that
                  golden cloud and hum of bees, and the old Franciscans smiled away from the big
                  butts, and the spectacled Professor bore us backward in his discourse to the days
                  when men passed whole lives as we were now passing hours, and believed they were
                  doing right, the illiterate heathen.</p>
               <p>"The Herr Professor will have us in Egyptian bondage directly, unless we hurry
                  away," said the lieutenant to me in a low voice; so we arose, as arise men who
                  bear away many bottles; and kindly greetings and adieux bore us off to the
                     <foreign xml:lang="DEU">wirth,</foreign> who hoped to see us soon again, and
                  bestowed all the titles on my companion that he had inherited and won; and we
                  sailed out into the moonlit streets of Mayence, and down to the hotel by the
                  arrowy Rhine, and slept the sleep of men who have drank good Brauneberger in a
                  grand old cellar surrounded by refined and genial companions.</p>

               <p>of garnered rhyme, from hidden stores of olden time, that since the language did
                  begin, have welcomed merry Christmas in, and made the winter nights so long, fleet
                  by on wings of wine and song; for when the snow is on the roof, the house within
                  is sorrow proof, if yule clog blazes on the hearth, and cups and hearts o'er-brim
                  with mirth. Then bring the wassail to the board, with nuts and fruit—the winter's
                  hoard; and bid the children take off shoe, to hang their stockings by the flue;
                  and let the clear and frosty sky, set out its brightest jewelry, to show old Santa
                  Claus the road, so he may ease his gimcrack load. And with the coming of these
                  times, we'll add some old and lusty rhymes, that suit the festive season well, and

               <p>And here are several hints to show, how Christmas oustoms first did grow, for as
                  the holy fathers say, some Pagan tricks we Christians play, and prove that Yule
                  and Christmas box, are not precisely orthodox, for so we quote and understand,</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>ANTIQUITIES FROM FATHER BRAND.</head>
                  <p>In the <emph>Primitive Church,</emph> Christmas-Day was always observed as the
                        <emph>Lord's-Day</emph> was, and was in like Manner<pb n="180-181"
                        xml:id="VAC6182-00000097"/> ner preceded by an <emph>Eve or Vigil.</emph>
                     Hence it is that our Church hath ordered an <emph>Eve</emph> before it, which
                     is observed by the Religious, as a Day of Preparation for that great
                     Festival.</p>
                  <p>Our Fore-Fathers, when the common Devotions of the <emph>Eve</emph> were over,
                     and Night was come on, were wont to light up <emph>Candles</emph> of an
                     uncommon Size, which were called <emph>Christmas-Candles,</emph> and to lay a
                        <emph>Log</emph> of Wood upon the fire, which they termed a
                        <emph>Yule-Clog</emph> or <emph>Christmas-Block</emph> These were to
                     Illuminate the House, and turn the Night into Day; which Custom, in some
                     Measure, is still kept up in the Northern Parts.</p>
                  <p>The Apostles were <emph>the Light of the World;</emph> and as our Saviour was
                     frequently called <emph>Light,</emph> so was his Coming into the World
                     signified, and pointed out by the Emblems of Light: "It was then," (says our
                     Countryman <emph>Gregory</emph>) "the longest Night in all the Year; and it was
                     the midst of that, and yet there was Day where he was: For a glorious and
                     betokening Light shined round about this <emph>Holy Child.</emph> So says
                     Tradition, and so the Masters describe the Night Piece of the Nativity." If
                     this be called in Question, as being only Tradition, it is out of Dispute, that
                     the Light which illuminated the Fields of <emph>Bethlehem,</emph> and shone
                     round about the <emph>Shepherds</emph> as they were watching their Flocks, was
                     an Emblem of that Light, which was then come into the World. "What can be the
                     Meaning," says <emph>venerable Bede,</emph> "that this Appartion of Angels was
                     surrounded with that heavenly Light, which is a Thing we never meet with in all
                     the Old Testament? For tho' Angels have appeared to Prophets and holy Men, yet
                     we never read of their Appearing in such Glory and Splendor before. It must
                     surely be, because this Privilege was reserved for the Dignity of this Time.
                     For when the true Light of the World, was born in the World, it was very proper
                     that the Proclaimer of His Nativity, should appear in the Eyes of Men, in such
                     an heavenly Light, as was before unseen in the World. And that
                        <emph>supernatural Star,</emph> which was the Guide of the <emph>Eastern
                        Magi,</emph> was a Figure of that <emph>Star,</emph> which was risen out of
                        <emph>Jacob; of that Light which should lighten the</emph> Gentiles." "God,"
                     says Bishop <emph>Taylor,</emph> "sent a miraculous Star, to invite and lead
                     them to a new and more glorious Light, the Light of Grace and Glory."</p>
                  <p>In Imitation of this, as <emph>Gregory</emph> tells us, the Church went on with
                     the Ceremony: And hence it was, that for the three or four First
                        <emph>Centuries,</emph> the whole <emph>Eastern Church</emph> called the
                     Day, which they observed for our Saviour's Nativity, the <emph>Epiphany</emph>
                     or Manifestation of the Light. And <emph>Cassian</emph> tells us, that it was a
                     Custom in <emph>Egypt,</emph> handed down by Tradition, as soon as the
                        <emph>Epiphany,</emph> or <emph>Day of Light</emph> was over, &amp;c. Hence
                     also came that ancient Custom of the same Church, taken Notice of by St.
                        <emph>Jerome,</emph> of lighting up Candles at the Reading of the Gospel,
                     even at Noon-Day; and that, not to drive away the Darkness, but to speak their
                     Joy for the good Tidings of the Gospel, and be an Emblem of that Light,<pb
                        n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6182-00000098"/> which the Psalmist says, <emph>was a
                        Lamp uuto his Feet and a Light unto his Paths.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <emph>Yule-Dough</emph> (or <emph>Dow</emph>), was a kind of
                        <emph>Baby</emph> or <emph>little Image of Paste,</emph> which our Bakers
                     used formerly to bake at this Season, and <emph>present</emph> to their
                        <emph>Customers,</emph> in the same manner as the Chandlers gave
                        <emph>Christmas Candles.</emph> They are called <emph>Yule-Cakes</emph> in
                     the county of Durham. I find in the antient Calendar of the Romish Church, that
                     at Rome, on the Vigil of the Nativity, <emph>Sweetmeats</emph> were
                        <emph>presented</emph> to the <emph>Fathers</emph> in the
                        <emph>Vatican,</emph> and that all Kinds of <emph>little Images</emph> (no
                     doubt of <emph>Paste</emph>) were to be found at the Confectioners' Shops.</p>
                  <p>There is the greatest Probability that we have had from <emph>hence</emph> both
                     our <emph>Yule-Doughs</emph> and <emph>Mince Pies,</emph> the latter of which
                     are still in common Use at this Season. The <emph>Yule-Doughs</emph> has
                     perhaps been intended for an <emph>Image</emph> of the <emph>Child
                        Jesus.</emph> It is now, if I mistake not, pretty generally laid aside, or
                     at most retained only by Children.</p>
                  <p>J. Boëmus Aubanus tells us, that in Franconia, on the three Thursday Nights
                     preceding the <emph>Nativity</emph> of our Lord, it is customary for the Youth
                     of both Sexes to go from <emph>House</emph> to <emph>House, knocking</emph> at
                     the <emph>Doors, singing</emph> their <emph>Christmas Carrols,</emph> and
                        <emph>wishing a happy new Year.</emph> They get in Return from the Houses
                     they stop at, <emph>Pears, Apples, Nuts,</emph> and even <emph>Money.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>Little Troops of Boys and Girls still go about in this very Manner at
                     Newcastle, some few Nights before, on the Night of the <emph>Eve</emph> of this
                     Day, and on that of the <emph>Day itself.</emph> The <emph>Hagmena</emph>

                      is still preserved among them. They still <emph>conclude,</emph> too,
                     with wishing "a <emph>merry Christ, mas,</emph> and a <emph>happy new

                  </note>
                  <p>We are told in the Athenian Oracle, that the <emph>Christmas Box Money</emph>
                     is derived from hence. The Romish Priests had Masses said for almost every
                     Thing: If a ship went out to the Indies, the Priests had a <emph>Box</emph> in
                     her-under the Protection of some Saint: And for Masses, as their Cant was, to
                     be said for them to that Saint, &amp;c., the poor People must put in something
                     into the Priests' Box, which is not to be opened till the Ship return.</p>
                  <p>The <emph>Mass</emph> at that time was called <emph>Christmas;</emph> the
                        <emph>Box, Christmas Box,</emph> or <emph>Money</emph> gathered against that
                     Time, that <emph>Masses</emph> might be made by the Priests to the Saints to
                        <emph>forgive</emph> the <emph>people</emph> the <emph>Debaucheries</emph>
                     of <emph>that Time;</emph> and from this Servants had the <emph>Liberty to get
                        Box Money,</emph> that <emph>they too</emph> might be <emph>enabled</emph>
                     to <emph>pay</emph> the <emph>Priest</emph> for his <emph>Masses,</emph>
                     knowing well the Truth of the Proverb: <q>
                        <l>"No Penny, No Pater-noster."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Custom observed at this Season, is the adorning of Windows with
                        <emph>Bay</emph> and <emph>Laurel.</emph> It is but seldom observed in the
                     North, but in the Southern-Parts it is very Common, particularly at our
                        <emph>Universities;</emph> where it is Customary to adorn, not only the
                     Common Windows<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6182-00000099"/> of the
                        <emph>Town,</emph> and of the <emph>Colleges,</emph> but also to bedeck the
                        <emph>Chapels</emph> of the <emph>Colleges,</emph> with <emph>Branches of
                        Laurel.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <emph>Laurel</emph> was used among, the ancient <emph>Romans,</emph> as an
                     Emblem of several Things, and in particular, of <emph>Peace,</emph> and Joy,
                     and Victory. And I imagine, it has been used at this Season by Christians, as
                     an Emblem of the same Things; as an Emblem of Joy for the Victory gain'd over
                     the Powers of Darkness, and of that <emph>Peace on Earth, that Good-will
                        towards Men,</emph> which the Angels sung over the Fields of
                        <emph>Bethlehem.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>It has been made use of by the <emph>Non Conformists,</emph> as an Argument
                     against Ceremonies, that the second Council of <emph>Bracara, Can.</emph> 73,
                     forbad Christians "<emph>to deck their Houses with Bay Leaves and Green
                        Boughs.</emph>" But the Council does not mean, that it was wrong in
                     Christians to make use of these Things, but only "<emph>at the same Time with
                        the Pagans, when they observed and solemnized their Paganish Pastime and
                        Worship.</emph> And of this Prohibition, they give this Reason in the same
                        <title>Canon;</title>
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Omnis hœc observatio paganismi est.</foreign> All this
                     kind of Custom doth hold of Paganism: Because the outward Practice of
                        <emph>Heathenish Rites,</emph> perform'd jointly with the Pagans themselves,
                     could not but imply a Consent in Paganism."</p>
                  <p>But at present, there is no hazard of any such Thing. It may be an Emblem of
                     Joy to us, without confirming any, in the practise of <emph>Heathenism.</emph>
                     The <emph>Time,</emph> the <emph>Place,</emph> and the <emph>Reasons</emph> of
                     the <emph>Ceremony,</emph> are so widely different, that, tho' formerly, to
                     have observed it, would unquestionably have been a Sin, it is now become
                     harmless, comely, and decent.</p>
                  <p>So here we close our prose and rhyme, and end the Chrismas pantomime, with
                     wishing health and happy cheer, to you through all the coming year, and
                     prosperous times in every State, for eighteen hundred sixty-eight.</p>

               <p>WE have received from our esteemed friend, and valued correspondent, whose paper
                  on the champagne wines of the ancients excited so much surprise and curiosity in
                  literary circles, another article upon kindred topics, which will no doubt prove
                  even more interesting than the former one. Embracing, as it does, a wider range of
                  inquiry, it exhibits more clearly than the other paper, unusual stores of
                  scholarship, at once comprehensive, familiar, and accurate; a vigorous and telling
                  style—in itself a model of good English writing; a curious and technical knowledge
                  of wines in general, beyond that of any modern writer with whom we are familiar,
                  an exact knowledge of chemistry, and a happy vein of humor, as original as it is
                  genuine. It is not surprising that the authorship of the last paper should have
                  been ascribed to several of the most profound scholars in the country. But we can
                  safely predicate of this one that it will excite a still wider range of
                  speculation as to the name of the writer, which, for the present, we shall
                  withhold until such time as we are permitted to print it.</p>

                  <p>MY DEAR EDITOR:—I have been much amused in learning through the press, as well
                     as from the more sprightly narrative of your private letter, that such and so
                     very odd claims and conjectures had been made as to the authorship of my late
                     hasty letter to you, in proof that the poets and gentlemen of old Greece and
                     Rome drank as good champagne as we do. You know very well that the letter which
                     you published was not originally meant for the public, and the public have no
                     right at all to inquire who the author may be; nor, indeed, has the said
                     impertinent public to inquire into the authorship of any anonymous article
                     which harms nobody, nor means to do so. I have not sought concealment in this
                     matter, nor do I wish notoriety. If any one desires the credit of the
                     communication, such as it is, he or she is quite welcome to it until I find
                     leisure to prepare for the press a collection of my Literary Miscellanies under
                     my own name. I intend to embody in it an enlarged edition of this essay on the
                     antiquity of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">champagne mousseux,</foreign> with a
                     regular chain of Greek and Latin authorities defending and proving all my
                     positions.</p>
                  <p>To this future collection of my critical and philological writings I look
                     forward with a just pride as a fit gift<pb n="188-189"
                        xml:id="VAC6182-00000101"/> to the few in our country who occupy their
                     leisure, not with light and trifling literature, but on grave and solid studies
                     (like the investigation of the Champagne question), and with the culture of
                     high and recondite learning; or, as this thought is admirably expressed by
                     Petrarch, in one of his epistles, announcing to a learned friend the completion
                     of one of his Latin prose works, in a passage which I have selected for the
                     motto of my own Collectanea: "Munus hocce prebeo, non iis qui levibus et
                     ludicris nugis assueti sunt, sed lis quibus cordi est, gravis et severus
                     bonarum literarum et doctrinæ reconditæ cultus."</p>
                  <p>You tell me that you have every day personal inquiries or written
                     communications to the Wine Press, desiring information as to the meaning of the
                     word <hi rend="i"/>Oxyporian, which I used as characterizing the effects of
                     certain wines. It seems that the word is in neither of the rival American
                     dictionaries, nor in any English one in present use. Of this I was not aware,
                     but if it is not in their dictionaries, so much the worse for the learned
                     lexicographers. It ought to have been there; they have no excuse for omitting
                     it. On the other hand, you and I deserve all such honor as the literary and
                     scientific public can bestow, for restoring the word Oxyporian to the present
                     generation. It is a good word, and one—as Corporal Bardolph phrases it—"of
                     exceeding good command." But I shall not imitate the gallant corporal in his
                     style of definition and explanation: "Accommodated! that is, when a man is, as
                     they say, accommodated; or when a man is—being—whereby—he may be thought to be
                     accommodated, which is an excellent thing." That is not <emph>my</emph>
                     fashion. This word OXYPORIAN is of great antiquity and high descent. It was
                     first used by Hippocrates, and from his medical use passed to that of the
                     philosophers, thence into the Latin, and thence to the old English medical and
                     philosophical writers down to Sydenham, since whose day it has not been used
                     for near two centuries. It is from the Greek <foreign xml:lang="GRC"
                        >Οξυποριος</foreign> and means simply that which is of speedy operation and
                     as quick in passing off—first used as a substantive name of such a medicine,
                     then as an adjective with a broader sense. I am sorry that it has gone out of
                     fashion, for no other word can supply its place, either for scientific or
                     literary use. The philosophy of the word, especially as applied to wines, is
                     nowhere better illustrated than by one of the old lost poets in a fragment
                     preserved by my favorite Athenæus. The Athenian dramatist, Philyllius thus
                     describes the Oxyporian character and effects of certain wines: <q>

                  <p>That last line cost me more labor than I have often bestowed upon a whole
                     lecture, and though it is hypercatelectic with redundant syllables, expressive
                     enough, I think of the metre and feeling of the original, it has not done full
                     justice to the crowded thought, the practical philosophy of the gay and wise
                     old heathen.</p>
                  <p>I never read Athenæus without renewed gratitude to kind Professor
                     Schweighauser, who first opened to me that treasure-house of the remains of
                     ancient bards, "with whom (justly says a modern critic) perished so much beauty
                     as the world will never see again." How fortunate it was that the old Greek
                     philosophical dinerout was as much given to quotation as Montaigne. Jeremy
                     Taylor or myself. As for the learned French-German or German-Frenchman,
                     Schweighauser—the recollections of my brief acquaintance with him rise in my
                     mind like "a steam of rich distilled perfumes," fraught with the memory of
                     refined classical criticism, and the flavor of the world-renowned culinary
                     product of his own beloved city of Strasbourg, the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">pâté
                        de foies gras.</foreign>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I must not forget to call your attention to the very curious parallel
                     between this fragment of an Athenian dramatic author and Falstaff's eulogy on
                     the virtues of his favorite sherris-sack. "It hath a twofold operation in it.
                     It ascends me into the brain, drives me forth all the foolish, dull and crudy
                     vapors which overrun it, makes it apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of
                     nimble, fiery and delectable shapes." "The second property of your excellent
                     sherris is the warming of the blood, which before cold and settled left the
                     liver white and cold, but the sherris-sack warms it"—Yet why need I quote any
                     more of what you and half your readers have by heart. Now there is not the
                     slightest ground for attributing this resemblance of thought and expression to
                     imitation. No, (as I remarked in one of my lectures on the resemblances to be
                     traced between Shakspeare and the Greek tragedies), the great ancients and this
                     greater modern coincide in thought because they alike draw their thoughts from
                     truth and nature and the depths of man's heart. The comparison of the passage
                     cited from Falstaff and that of which I have above given my feeble version,
                     affords ample evidence of this. They agree marvellously in describing the
                        <emph>immediate</emph> operation of the lighter Greek wines, resembling our
                     best Bordeaux and champagne, and that of Falstaff's more powerful and grave
                     sherry. In this they are equally true. But the Greek goes on to insist on the
                     Oxyporian worth of his favorite wines in gladdening the whole man "with mirth
                     which after no repentance draws." Not so the great English poet. He, with a
                     dietetic and physiological philosophy as profound and as accurate as was his
                     insight into the affections and passions of man, passes over in profound
                     silence this point on which the Greek bard dwells. This Shakspeare does, not
                     from ignorance, but to lead the reader to infer from Falstaff's own
                     infirmities, that such was <emph>not</emph> the after-operation of Falstaff's
                        "inordinate<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6182-00000103"/> dinate deal of
                     sack"—that his drink was not Oxyporian—that did not pass away "like the
                     baseless fabric of a vision" (and, to use the words of the great bard in a
                     sense which he might not immediately have intended, but which was,
                     nevertheless, present to his vast intellect:) <q>

                     festivities, you present me with a basket or two of sparkling native wine

                     be multiplied a hundred fold! The professor, upon the exhibition of a proper

                  <p>The same experiments might with great propriety, and, doubtless, with equal

                  <p>I have just said that I am determined not to enter at present into verbal
                     controversy on the accuracy of my translations and citations on the great
                     question of the champagne of antiquity. I leave all that till my proposed
                     publication, which I trust will settle the question, even against the authority
                     of Eustathius and Gladstone as to the word <foreign xml:lang="GRC"
                        >οινοπα</foreign>, though the one was a Greek archbishop eight hundred years
                     ago, and the other is the present Chancellor of the Exchequer of the British
                     Empire, and has just achieved the triumph of abolishing the duties on champagne
                     and other wines of France.</p>
                  <p>But I learn that two other arguments have been advanced against my doctrine,
                     both from distinguished quarters, and both founded, not upon the authority of
                     scholiasts and lexicons, but upon the principles and reasoning of the higher
                     criticism.</p>
                  <p>The first of these is advanced by President King, of your New York Columbia
                     College. His objection to my argument is briefly this: If either the Greeks or
                     the Romans had champagne, Horace must have taken his share, and luxuriated in
                     recounting its merits and glories. As Horace makes not even a distant allusion
                     to any wine of this kind, no such can have been in use in his days. I have a
                     great respect for President King's judgment, both in respect to champagne and
                     to Horace; and his argument is logical in form and plausible in reasoning.
                     Still this must have been an <foreign xml:lang="LAT">obiter dictum</foreign> of
                     his (as the lawyers say), not a formal decision, such as he would have given on
                     full argument and examination of the authorities. I think that I can convince
                     the President of the error of his argument; and considering the magnitude of
                     the question, and the responsibilities of his position, I am confident that he
                     has too much candor to persist in his error after duly weighing my
                     reasoning.</p>
                  <p>I object entirely to Horace's testimony—to his competence—if he is offered as

                     facts, then to the credibility, weight, or value of his negative testimony.
                     This objection arises from no general disrespect to his character or talent. I
                     am far from agreeing with an accomplished professor of your city, whom I might
                     address in the words of Horace, <q>
                        <l>"Docte sermones utriusque linguæ,"</l>
                     </q> as master alike of the tongue of Shakspeare and of that of Schiller. I
                     cannot agree with him in vilipending<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6182-00000105"/>
                     Horace—to use a word of Charles Fox's, which I fancy has not been used since
                     his days. I was told lately, at a literary party in Boston, by an eminent
                     fellow-citizen of yours, that this accomplished New York professor had
                     pronounced Horace to be "a mediocre old fogy." So do not I.</p>
                  <p>As a keen-sighted observer and describer of men and manners, full of shrewd
                     good sense and worldly wisdom, Horace has no rival; and the unanswerable proof
                     of it is that his thoughts and maxims, and even language, on such topics, have
                     been incorporated into the thoughts, language, and best literature of all
                     modern nations. In pure poetry, his patriotic pride and ardent love of country
                     often raise him to the noblest strains of lyric declamation. Above all, he has
                     an unrivalled power of natural but condensed expression, compressing whole
                     pages of thought, or of description of nature, of form or of manner, into a
                     short phrase or a brilliant word or two. On some other points I nearly agree
                     with your professor, who is as polyglot in knowledge as he is in languages.
                     Horace's love-verses I hold very cheap. In these he is indeed graceful,
                     courtly, airy, elegant; but he has little passion and no tenderness. If he ever
                     approaches to any semblance of either passion or affection, it is when he
                     translates or imitates the Greek, to which source late German critics have
                     traced not a few of his minor lyric beauties, and made it probable that he owed
                     more than can now be clearly ascertained. The other line, in which I hold him
                     to be still more clumsy and out of his element, is that which specially relates
                     to our present purpose. It is that which he often affects, and affects with
                     little success, the gaiety of the Bacchanalian songster. In nearly every one of
                     his convivial odes he is as far as possible from the light gaiety or the broad
                     jollity of such poets as Burns or Béranger, and a dozen Scotch and Irish
                     songsters of far less name but of scarcely less merit. In his desperate
                     attempts at jollity, his constant incentive to festivity—which seems to mean,
                     with him, nothing but hard drinking—is the shortness of human life and the
                     black prospect of death, so that his festive odes may be condensed into the
                     thought of Captain Macheath, in the Beggar's Opera: <q>
                        <l>"A man will die bolder with brandy."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Much as in his "Moriture Delli," etc., he is inferior to the gay songsters of
                     later times, he appears still worse when any of his scenes of conviviality are
                     compared with those of Shakspeare, of Cervantes, or of Scott, with the feasts
                     of Falstaff, of Sancho, or of Friar Tuck.</p>
                  <p>If I compare Horace with these moderns, it is because the contrast is more
                     striking from our familiarity with the latter. But the same thing might be
                     shown to scholars by placing him by the side of Plutus, or of the remains of
                     Greek comedy. The truth is, that Horace, with all his love of company, his
                     shrewd observation of life, his keen perception of the ridiculous, was
                     decidedly a melancholy man. I do not believe that in his most<pb n="198-199"
                        xml:id="VAC6182-00000106"/> convivial hours, he ever rung out that hearty
                     peal of laughter for which Walter Scott was, celebrated; nor was Horace, in
                     those solitay rambles of his about the shops, markets and by-places of Rome,
                     which he so agreeably relates, ever seen smiling and chuckling to himself, over
                     his own thick-coming pleasant fancies, like your Halleck, when amusing himself
                     in the same fashion in his frequent visits to Boston or New York.</p>
                  <p>Yes, Horace was clearly as melancholy a man, when by himself, as Lord Byron
                     was, and for the same reason, a stomach performing its functions badly, and
                     stimulated in the one case by Falernian, in the other by strong gin and
                     water.</p>
                  <p>Horace himself, unconsiously, shows us the philosophy of all this, in the
                     account which he gives here and there of his own history. He had led a pretty
                     hard, promiscuous sort of a life in his early days of inglorious and disastrous
                     military rank. Afterward he got up in the world, and became the holder of a
                     comfortable office, of more profit than honor; and then, by the favor of his
                     friends in power, became a well-to-do country gentleman. Next we find him
                     suffering the certain penalties of an early debauched and chronically
                     debilitated stomach. He had weak eyes, and a deranged digestion, the first
                     being the natural result of the other malady. He at times resorted to total
                     abstinence and cold water, and became a great critic in good water, in which
                     last particular he showed his usual practical good sense. He was constantly
                     running about, as he tells us, from the plain fare of his Sabine farm to Rome,
                     where he shared the luxurious table of Mecænas. Thence he galloped off to Baiæ,
                     the Newport of that day; then from one mineral spring to another; now dosing
                     himself with chalybeate, now with sulphur water. But all this water regimen is
                     interspersed with frolic after frolic in old Falernian. His love of Falernian
                     flashes the whole truth upon us. What was this famed Falernian wine? It was,
                     unquestionably, a rich, high-flavored wine, but as unquestionably most highly
                     brandied, decidedly fortified with an enormous proportion of alcohol, nearly
                     bringing it up to the proof of our most approved old cognac. The commentators
                     and compilers of antiquities do not let us into the secret of this same famed
                     Falernian. But I speak on the very best authority. It is that of Pliny the
                     naturalist.</p>
                  <p>In speaking of the strong Roman wines, he says of the Falernian varieties, in a
                     customary phrase of his, that there is no wine of higher authority, "Nec ulli
                     in vino major auctoritas." He then adds, that it was inflammable! and the only
                     wine that was so: "Solo vinorum flame accenditur." "It is the only kind from
                     which flame can be kindled." The ancients had no more precise test than this
                     one, that of burning with a flame, to ascertain the proportion of alcohol in
                     these liquors. They had nothing similar to the various beautiful modes of
                     modern chemistry, to ascertain the alcoholic proportions of wine as the
                     eboulliscope of the French chemists, the<pb n="200-201"
                        xml:id="VAC6182-00000107"/> halymetric method used by Fuchs and Zieri, and
                     the ingenious aerometer of Tabaric, all which give such elegant precision to
                     the alcoholic tables, digested and enlarged by our exact Dutch friend,
                     Professor Mulder. But Pliny's statement is enough to prove that the strength of
                     Falernian did not arise from "combined alcohol" formed in the natural process
                     of fermentation of the grape juice, but from added "uncombined alcohol" (as the
                     chemists term it) produced by distillation. On this very question, I cannot
                     refrain from quoting the opinion of Dr. Watson, of New York, in his most
                     agreeable, learned and instructive work on "The Medical Profession in Ancient
                     Times," a volume which, if it had been published in London, would have been
                     reprinted in the United States, and had a circulation of thousands. Dr. Watson
                     says thus: "I copy from the volume on my table which I have just read with much
                     gratification to myself, and the highest respect for the author's science and
                     scholarship." After quoting Pliny, he says, "modern wines with only their
                     natural supply of alcohols are not of strength equal to this. It is therefore
                     reasonable to infer that the art of distillation must have been known to the
                     vintners of antiquity. If so, it must have been confined to some fraternity and
                     practised by them as one of their secret mysteries, for the purpose of
                     fortifying their wines, and thus kept secret until alcohol was discovered anew
                     by the alchemists of the middle ages." Such was Falernian, differing only from
                     our Cognac brandy from having a full vinous body with a luscious fruity
                     flavor.</p>
                  <p>This exposition of the true character of Falernian at once explains and is
                     confirmed by the fact that Horace often in his exhortations to the hardest
                     drinking, speaks of some rules of mixing water with the Falernian, which no
                     Greek or Roman author mentions as usual as to other wines, excepting only
                     certain Greek wines of a similar potency.</p>
                  <p>All the above stated considerations prove to my satisfaction (and I trust also
                     to that of President King) that Horace, with all his matchless merits, was
                     exactly in the state of certain of our mutual acquaintances, some of whom, men
                     of the prairie or of the plantation, alternate between "total abstinence" and
                     unquenchable thirst for Bourbon and Monongahela; others, again, habitués of
                     city clubs and hotels, vibrate between soda or congress water, and old Otard,
                     or Geneva, more or less diluted with water; generally less than more, and every
                     day becoming more and more less.</p>
                  <p>Now to the inference from this statement of facts: Would you, Mr. President, or
                     you, Mr. Editor, take the opinion or the evidence of any such, of our
                     acquaintance, though we should receive it with all respect on any other point,
                     political, commercial, or financial—upon any question touching champagne. You
                     would not? Neither do I accept Horace's testimony on the same subject.</p>
                  <p>I learn that I have to meet another argument, levelled<pb n="202-203"
                        xml:id="VAC6182-00000108"/> at my Homeric interpretation, of the word
                     commonly rendered "dark," which I hold to mean "champagnefaced," or covered
                     with foam like champagne. This is from another dignitary of learning, not of
                     your city, whose high scholarship is everywhere admitted. He is armed with the
                     authority and clothed with the dignity of Jupiter, yet I cannot say with the
                     Italian chief, <q>

                     </q> and I am thrice armed in the cause of truth and of Homer.</p>
                  <p>As in respect to Horace, so in this Homeric question, I defer for the present
                     all mere verbal and lexicographical disquisition. My future readers will have
                     quite enough of it in my forthcoming volumes. But I willingly meet the great
                     argument of my very learned and eminent critic, as it claims to rest upon
                     broad, historical and critical grounds.</p>
                  <p>He boldly maintains that Homer could not have known personally anything of
                     champagne—even supposing that there was anything resembling it in his day—that
                     throughout his two epics he never intimates in himself or in his heroes any
                     taste or connoisseurship in wine, though he describes the drinking of a good
                     deal of it, to which he gives various indiscriminating epithets, as "pleasant,"
                     "sweet," "divine," "dark," or "red." Above all, it is asserted that he betrays
                     the grossest ignorance on its use in making his venerable Nestor (who should
                     have known better) mix grated cheese with his old Pramnian wine.</p>
                  <p>Before entering on the wider field of discussion, I must briefly refute this
                     last wholly unsound objection. It is easily and quickly done. Any reader who
                     will carefully read the whole of the eleventh book of the Iliad, either in the
                     original or in any tolerably faithful translation—even in Pope's brilliant but
                     commonly loose paraphrase—will see at once that this preparation of old wine,
                     thickened with grated goat's milk cheese, and flour, which Nestor took with his
                     wounded friend after their escape from battle, was clearly a medical
                     prescription prepared under the professional direction of Machaon, who was
                     surgeon-general of the Greek allied army, as well as commanding colonel of his
                     own and his brother's contingent. Machaon had a flesh wound; Nestor, a very old
                     man, was prostrated by fatigue and fright.</p>
                  <p>The word used is <foreign xml:lang="GRC">κυκεων</foreign>, meaning a compound
                     potion, and Pope with far more precision than is usual with him, renders it
                     "the draught prescribed." I cannot help thinking that this happy version was
                     suggested to the poet by his scholarly medical friend Dr. Arbuthnot, to whom he
                     and Swift often expressed their warm acknowledgments for services, medical,
                     literary and social: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">

                  <p>Dr. Holmes may very probably sneer at the prescribed mixture, and I will not
                     pretend to defend it, for that is not in my line. But Machaon was a physician
                     of great eminence in his day, and seems to have anticipated the doctrines of
                     Brown or of Broussais, and to have been inclined to a bold practice in
                     stimulants. As a surgeon, he stood at the very head of his profession. Besides,
                     this was his prescription for himself, as well as for his friend; and when the
                     physician thus shares with his patient the risk or the benefit of his potion,
                     even Dr. Holmes, heretic in medical faith as he is, will allow that the patient
                     may venture boldly to swallow whatever may be ordered. I trust that Dr. Watson
                     will discuss this whole question in the next edition of his <title>Medical
                        Profession in Ancient Times.</title> In the meanwhile, enough has been said
                     to exonerate both Homer and the Pylian sage from the charge of heathenish
                     ignorance in regard to wine.</p>
                  <p>Indeed as to Nestor, even if the poet's frequent testimonials in the Iliad to
                     his wisdom and vast knowledge earned by old experience, are not enough to
                     exempt him from any suspicion of gross ignorance in respect to good wine, he
                     himself has given ample proof of his taste and judgment in such matters in the
                     Odyssey. When the son of Ulysses, in that epic, visits Nestor at his home in
                     Pylos, he finds the aged chief presiding at a grand sacrifice and banquet.
                     Before Nestor knows who his guest is he greets him kindly, and besides ordering
                     for him and his friend a choice portion of the feast, gives them a goblet
                     bumper of Malmsey Madeira.</p>
                  <p>Here I must pause and explain, to prevent the barking of small critics. Homer
                     calls the wine <foreign xml:lang="GRC">μελιευης</foreign>—"honey-s weet"—which
                     proves it to have been a luscious, sweet, fruity wine; and all who are at all
                     learned in the history of grape culture know that the Malmsey of Madeira is the
                     product of a vine in Madeira, originally imported from the district of
                     Malvasia, in the Peloponesus, which lay within Nestor's own territory. From
                     Malvasie came the Spanish and Portuguese name of the wine, Malvasio; thence the

                     digression is forced upon me. Nestor gives his unknown guest, with all the rest
                     of the crowd, plenty of new, pleasant and sweet Malmsey of his own growth; but
                     afterward, when he knew that the son of his old friend was his guest, he gives
                     him a more select entertainment with his family: <q>

                     defining the office confided to confidential old ladies in well-regulated
                     households in Greece, like Nestor's. Homer in his original Greek expresses the

                     over, as if it was not genteel to have a female butler. The German translators,
                     on the contrary, honestly use the resources of their noble language, as copious
                     and flexible as the Greek, in its compounds, but give a rather broader sense,

                     aware till after I had made my translation that the best Dutch translator, the
                     illustrious Vondel, the Dryden of Holland, had formed a word of his own
                     precisely parallel to my own, though more sonorous and musical, "<foreign
                        xml:lang="DUT">de schenckstervrouw.</foreign> But I must restrain myself on
                     these tempting verbal digressions (as I have done in my classical quotations),
                     lest I should incur the Shakspearean sarcasm, he "has been at a great feast of
                     languages and stolen the scraps." Let us return to Nestor.</p>
                  <p>Nestor never dreamed of giving his guests wine-whey, such as he had taken,
                     according to prescription, nor does he offer them any grated cheese to mix with
                     their new Malmsey, or their eleven years' old Pylian Particular.</p>
                  <p>Then, as to Homer's personal opportunities of becoming practically familiar
                     with the good wines of his times, is it possible that my erudite critic
                     imagines Homer to have led a straggling beggar-like life, like an Italian
                     organ-grinder? The great bard has himself described his own <foreign
                        xml:lang="LAT">status</foreign> and habitual life in the picture he gives of
                     the blind bard Domodoius, and the respect with which he is received, and the
                     luxury he shares in at the sumptutous court of the good king Alconous. Like
                     him, Homer mer himself passed from the table of one king, prince, potentate or
                     laird to that of another, faring sumptuously every day, and thus becoming as
                     familiar with the qualities of the several Chian, Lesbian, Thrasian, Pramnain
                     and Pylian vintages, as our acquaintance Thackeray did with the old Madeiras of
                     Boston, Salem, Richmond and Charleston, or the choice Bourdeaux and Rhine wines
                     of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">recherché</foreign> tables in New York. I might
                     quote an hundred scattered lines in the Iliad to prove this. But why dwell upon
                     minor points of evidence? "The greatest is behind." While Homer ascribes this
                     good taste and knowledge of good wine to his wisest old man, has he not
                     distinguished that hero, who is second only in rank to Achilles, by his taste
                     and judgment in the same line? Do not the plot and the interest of the second
                     great epic depend mainly upon this characteristic of its hero, and the just
                     pride he feels in his good cellar?</p>
                  <p>Alas! I ask these questions as if the answer was familiar to all who read Homer
                     even in the translations of Pope or Cowper. Alas! alas! I do not know that a
                     single critic, or annotator, has explained—any Greek instructor or professor
                     here or even in Germany has made his students familiar with this great feature
                     of Homer's domestic epic, the Odyssey, and of its hero Ulysses.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless, the filial piety of Virgil's Æneas—the deep melancholy love of
                     Tasso's Tancredi—the "noble mind," "the courtier's, scholar's, soldier's eye,
                     tongue, sword," of the accomplished Hamlet are none of them<pb n="208-209"
                        xml:id="VAC6182-00000111"/> so essential a part of these several characters
                     and of their eventful stories, as are to the character and story of Ulysses,
                     his taste and skill in wine, his judgment and its management and use, and the
                     deep interest which he manifests in his own fine and carefully selected
                     stock.</p>
                  <p>In the very beginning of the Odyssey, before Ulysses himself appears on the
                     scene, the poet, to make his reader acquainted with his hero's character,
                     introduces him into the wine-room of the long-absent chief. It is quite worthy
                     of remark that he is the only king or chief mentioned in either great epic,
                     except Nestor, who had a regular, well-ordered wine-room, or cellar. These few
                     chiefs, I must remind my readers, are repeatedly designated by the great poet,
                     as the wisest of all the Greeks, so adjudged by the common voice—Nestor, from
                     his varied experience and the collected wisdom he had gathered during the few
                     generations of men among whom he had lived. Ulysses, from his own native
                     sagacity. No other Greeks compared with them either in general wisdom, or in
                     judgment in the choice or care of their wines.</p>
                  <p>Another proof of the true nature of this "wine," as Homer delicately calls it,
                     is to be seen in the care with which the good priest kept it out of the way of
                     all his servants, reserving it for the private drinking of himself and wife, of
                     course in all moderation. <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Of that pure drink, fit for the gods, no one</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>By the way, this priest of Apollo seems to have been a sort of prince-bishop,
                     keeping a large establishment of men and women servants. Yet he, too, like
                     Newton and Ulysses, put his choice liquors and stores under the care of a
                     butleress, or, as I have preferred to render it in a more Homeric phrase, and
                     in the spirit of the Greek compound, a Butler-dame.</p>
                  <p>Achilles, for instance, was a model of gentlemanly hospitality, carved
                     beautifully, and gave his guests the best wine that force or money could get;
                     but he had no stock of it, and did not know how to manage it, if he had it. Not
                     so the "much-contriving" Ulysses.</p>
                  <p>Before Ulysses enters upon the scene, his son, Telemachus is described as
                     preparing for a secret voyage in search of his long-absent father, and this
                     affords Homer an opportunity to paint in anticipation, though indirectly, the
                     most striking peculiarities of his hero. His cellar, or wine-room (for it
                     appears to have been above ground, though on the ground-floor), is
                     superintended, like that of Nestor, by an aged female butler. I am not quite
                     satisfied with any translator, and I render the lines thus: <q>

                  <p>I translate as literally as metre will permit, in honest, "English verse,

                     graphic touches of the great poet, who always narrates to the eye, and in turn
                     displays "<foreign xml:lang="ITA">la terribil via,</foreign>" the grand and
                     terrible manner of Michael Angelo, or the grace, dignity and expression of
                     Raphael, and then rivals the most painstaking Dutch or Flemish painter in his
                     careful details of the butchery, the barn-yard, the market, the kitchen or the
                     wine cellar.</p>
                  <p>I flatter myself that in spite of the obvious difficulty of such passages, I
                     have, in the above and my other scraps of Homeric versions, succeeded in
                     expressing some exquisite details which Pope's rhymes have polished into vague
                     smoothness, and Cowper's more faithful, but too uniformly Miltonic, blank verse
                     has failed to render.</p>
                  <p>After this preliminary sketch of the "many planning" Ulysses, we find him
                     everywhere taking his wine like a gentleman, never in any excess, but always
                     with good taste, whether at the table of the magnificent king of Pharacia or at
                     the humble fireside of the keeper of his own hogs. He avoids the snares of
                     Circe by refusing to drink her brewed and drugged liquor. When he explored the
                     land of the Cyclops, he took with him a goatskin of high proof brandy, given
                     him by the priest of Apollo, which he used only in case of accidents. I say
                     "BRANDY;" for though Homer calls it wine, that must have been from delicacy
                     toward the reverend gentleman, for the poet expressly says that the worthy
                     priest and his wife were wont: <q>

                     quite raw, which soon made him tipsy (or, as the original expresses it with
                     philosophical accuracy "came around his brain,") then puts him to sleep, when

                     the wine cup crowned with his own best vintages, lifted high and passed around
                     by the insolent invaders of his home and his honor. Then it is, when the
                     loudest and boldest of these revellers lifts to his head a huge two-handled
                     goblet of choice Ithaca Reserve, that he who had long watched these scenes in
                     suppressed wrath, and in the guise and garb of a begger, now "throws off his
                     patience and his rags together," rises from the mendicant into the monarch, and
                     from his mighty bow showers around winged arrowy vengeance upon the wretches
                     who had essayed to win the affections of his wife, who had plundered his
                     possessions, who had wronged and insulted his darling only son, and who had
                     swilled, without appreciating it, pipe after pipe of his much prized wine, all
                     of it carefully selected, in splendid condition, and most of it more than
