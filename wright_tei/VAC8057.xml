PREFACE.&#xD;
EVENTS of every-day life are constantly occurring,&#xD;
which, if recorded, would make more thrilling hi~to..&#xD;
ries than many of the volumes which aspire to have&#xD;
no other character than' that of romantic interest, 4&#xD;
produced at the sacrifice, if needs be, of every other&#xD;
quality.&#xD;
In the present volume, a truthful story of &amp;amp;~th-&#xD;
em life has been conscientiously recorded,-or~ ~~ot&#xD;
unusual in the country of' its Iooation, yet~ ~~st&#xD;
deeply' interesting, for the many morale it8 detailed&#xD;
naturally suggest.&#xD;
It is the privilege and the duty of the living  4&#xD;
and responsible actors upon the stage of life to learn&#xD;
from the experience of the past, akid make, infer-&#xD;
ences of what may naturally occur in the' fQtui~e.&#xD;

(i  PRFACEPREFACE.                                                                        7&#xD;
&#xD;
If any thing be set down in the pages that follow&#xD;
this imperfect preface which creates surprise in the&#xD;
reader,-developes an unexpected phase in society,&#xD;
-or exhibits an heretofore unfamiliar sentiment,-&#xD;
the question that arises, can these things be true?&#xD;
should be seriously thought over; and then should&#xD;
come the inquiry, what are the extraordinary causes&#xD;
that produce them in the organization of society?&#xD;
What may be the effect of the "Master's&#xD;
IXouse" upon the reader, the author cannot antici-&#xD;
pate.; his own understanding of the purposes in-&#xD;
tended is clear, and if he has failed, it has been&#xD;
from a determination on his part to s~f~en his pic-&#xD;
tures, rather than "to give them in their true, but&#xD;
n6t unexaggerated colors.&#xD;
lilt would sometimes seem as if the influence of&#xD;
Christianity was fading from the world, or that its&#xD;
ministers had lost their influence, when its plainest&#xD;
precepts can be violated, without rousing a spirit of&#xD;
condemnation, which, if impotent to eiitirely prevent,&#xD;
might at least protest against the disregard of the&#xD;
plainest precepts of the moral law.&#xD;
~This volume is dedicated to the lovers of man-&#xD;
kind,-to those who desire the highest development,&#xD;
&#xD;
arid would, by having the evils of society exposed,&#xD;
learn where to commence the necessary reform.&#xD;
There are defects in ou~ social and political systems&#xD;
that are working evils, which, if not checked, and&#xD;
finally eradicated, must accomplish universal ruin.&#xD;
The remedies, if of the right kind~ are neither in-&#xD;
stant in their operation, nor revolutionary in their&#xD;
character; the first advancement, is 'the admi~ion&#xD;
that reform is needed, and then the manner of it8&#xD;
accomplishment will readily suggest itself&#xD;

TIlE MASTER'S HOUSE;&#xD;
&#xD;
from the most superficial observer. It seems to stand out&#xD;
from among the more pretentious residences by which it is&#xD;
surrounded, as would John Hancock in his rich but quaint&#xD;
costume, if suddenly thrust into a group of modern gen-&#xD;
tlemen.&#xD;
There is a width of front, and massiveness of stone-&#xD;
work about this grand old house, a ludicrous largeness&#xD;
about the knocker, and a mysterious symbolization about&#xD;
the coat of arms wrought among the mouldings over t~ie&#xD;
door-way, that tells a tale of men and sentiments whieh&#xD;
have for ever passed away, yet there is left behind a mark,&#xD;
well calculated to command profound respect.&#xD;
The inhabitants of this old mansion were descendants of&#xD;
a family whose members were famous among our Puritan&#xD;
fathers, yet there was little left to them but the traditional&#xD;
greatness of the past. They retained of a once splen-&#xD;
did fortune, a 'simple competency, but with 'decreasing&#xD;
wealth came increasing pride. They lived almost in the&#xD;
seclusion of ascetics, and, cornplacent themselves, they had&#xD;
apparently no desire to conciliate the goad will of the less&#xD;
pretentious people about them, and thereby were almost&#xD;
forgotten, or unobserved by the inhabitants of MaIden.&#xD;
On summer days they ~could-be seen moving to church&#xD;
with a stately manner, that shed a kind of chilling influence&#xD;
about them, and having arrived at the. "house of prayer,"&#xD;
they took their seats "for worship," with a grim 'smile of&#xD;
satisfaction,' which would have done honor to the sternest&#xD;
spirits of the "Protectorate."~&#xD;
Upon week days they were rarely seen in 'the streets,&#xD;
and then guarded from intimacy by a careful attention to&#xD;

'dress, which seemed to render them incapable of performing&#xD;
a hearty salutation, or indulging a genial smile, ~withoiit&#xD;
deranging a personal appearance of so much importance~ to&#xD;
be preserved, that it must be done, even at the sacrifice of&#xD;
the symbolic language of courtesy and friendship.&#xD;
The unsociabilityy of the hastings family," as hinted,&#xD;
made little impression upon the town; it was kept before&#xD;
the inhabitants more by the noble looking old mansion,&#xD;
than by any thing else, and perhaps it would not have been&#xD;
observed at all, but for, the fact, that Annie Hastings, the&#xD;
only young person in this family, had, imperceptibly to her&#xD;
staid guardians and to the community, grown into nn at-&#xD;
tractive, laughing, hearty girl; but as she made acquaint-&#xD;
ances with her s~li~olniates of her own age, and was beloved&#xD;
by all whom she met, she shed over the previous dreary asso-&#xD;
ciations of her household, a genial sunshine, so natural&#xD;
to youth, and so contagious in spite of one's self.&#xD;
Annie, although naturally of an enthusiastic tempera-&#xD;
ment, had, insensihly to herself, adopted a quiet manner,&#xD;
the natural result of the education she had received, and&#xD;
the 'examples set before her; yet she was a' great favorite&#xD;
with the few students' who were occasionally indebted to&#xD;
the inmates of the Hastings House for a kind of formal&#xD;
hospitality, given more because having company was a tra-&#xD;
ditionary peculiarity, than a present necessity. She was&#xD;
also an object of interest, because it was thought by many&#xD;
a visionary youth, that Annie must be very miserable, im-&#xD;
mured, as they imagined, a sort of prisoner, amongbthe&#xD;
solemn people within' the heavy walls of the "old~ Hast-&#xD;
ings House."&#xD;

16              TUE MA8TER~S HOUSE&#xD;
&#xD;
Among all the students of Maiden, Graham ~ildmay&#xD;
was the only one who maintained the p~ition ~i a con-&#xD;
s~ta~t visitor at the home of Annipliastings. lie was a&#xD;
"Southern student," known to be the heir 'of a large es-&#xD;
tate, possessed a tall and manly personal appearance, pleas-&#xD;
ing aanners, and what is not uncommon to youth from his&#xD;
'section of country, but yet' 'not characteristic, was of&#xD;
rather a serious temperament.&#xD;
It might be supposed that the constant visits of a gen-&#xD;
erous hearted and noble looking young stranger, ~would&#xD;
h~we created a sentiment in Annie's heart that would soon&#xD;
ripen into love; but~ Graham Mildm~y was so courteouS, so&#xD;
deferential in manner, that the fact of his being the most&#xD;
distinguished student of his college, gratified Annie's pride,&#xD;
called into action her intellectual faculties, but excited no&#xD;
deeper emotions.&#xD;
But' this was not all. Aunie~ Hastings was still very&#xD;
young, and ~he was so educated to look upon herself; she&#xD;
also had that proper appreciation of her own' merits and&#xD;
position, that she never thought admirers would be dilUcult&#xD;
'to obtain. But there was a difference of sentiment exist-&#xD;
ing~bet*een Mildmay and herself, that had been the sub-&#xD;
ject of a thousand conversations, and yet had never been&#xD;
reconciled, and this disagreement involved a high principle,&#xD;
that waS in Annie's feelings' only to be overcome by an in-&#xD;
tensity of' love, still foreign to her heart.&#xD;
'Mildmay, was cordially accepted among the, young&#xD;
men. of- ttie college from his section of the Union, ~s "one&#xD;
of' their'~own set," yet he never entered heartily into their&#xD;
dissipations, or became :seriously involved in any way, with&#xD;
&#xD;
their rqj~4~s am~jsements. lie was popular with all who&#xD;
knew *~is'nian1iness, and seamed to happi~yeon~bine&#xD;
industrious habits with the cultivated inanne~ and easy&#xD;
bearing, so peculiar to the youth of the South. There was&#xD;
a sense of innate worth, and ~pecuniary ability about Mild-&#xD;
may, that so, frequently distinguishes the highly ecbxeatea&#xD;
planter from the' mere busi~es~ man, which, joined with h*&#xD;
acknowledged moral worthmade him a universal favorite.&#xD;
His manners atoned for many thoughtless breaches of disci-&#xD;
pimp, on the part of his fellow ~outheruer~, and he was&#xD;
every where spoken of, as one destined to a high position&#xD;
in the councils of his country, and assigned a leading place&#xD;
as a future statesman of- the ~South.&#xD;
With two or three of his intimate friends, Mildmay&#xD;
sauntered down the principal street of Maiden; he was in&#xD;
fine spirits, for he had carried ~off the "honors~ of his&#xD;
class," and as "~aledictoric&amp;amp;n," was the hero of 'the hour.&#xD;
No one felt envious that he~wore the scholastic ctown.&#xD;
Through four long years ~f study he bad been ui~iformly&#xD;
at the head of his classes, had never maliciously broken a&#xD;
college' rule, had originated no diiUojilty with hit&#xD;
students, had always been' generous to prodigality;~ and all&#xD;
the while, seemingly, the least ambitious student in the in-&#xD;
stitution.&#xD;
The group of young gentlemen as they pursued their&#xD;
way, as if attracted by some magnetic in~uence, passed the&#xD;
old and aristocratic mansion of the Hastings family; Ann'&#xD;
nie was only partially visible at the window, for a ambi-&#xD;
tious vine covered with ~ay flowers, crept luxuriantly over&#xD;
the casement, concealing a full view of her fair face; while&#xD;

her hand, on which she leaned, was involved in her flaxen&#xD;
curls. ~ Somewhat to her own astonishment, she was sad,&#xD;
and felt it was because she was thinking of the olwnge that&#xD;
~ould take place in her circumscribed world, by the break-&#xD;
ing up of the Senior Class of the Halls of MaIden.&#xD;
" I see," said Singleton Minor, looking archly at Mild-&#xD;
may, ~'that you have brought us on a pilgrimage to your&#xD;
own shrine, and will give us a chance at a respectful dis-&#xD;
tance, to worship my lady of a thousand graces."&#xD;
"Very natural indeed," quoth Reynolds Calhoun.&#xD;
"Graham wishes us to see how pretty northern-sentiments&#xD;
j~an be done up in angelic forms. I think my faith Would&#xD;
be staggered, if pretty Annie Hastings would condescend&#xD;
to give me a lecture on the enormous sin of o~ir 'peculiar&#xD;
"And &amp;amp; poor preacher indeed would she be," said&#xD;
Adolph Marigny, heartily laughing, "for she would carry&#xD;
into slavery an honest Christian youth of our own land,&#xD;
and one nearly as fair as herself. I think," continued Ma-&#xD;
rigny, seemingly very earnest indeed, "I think universal&#xD;
emaucip&amp;amp;tion must prevail, unless ~we can make out a special&#xD;
case in favor of a particular individual; "and the gay Lonisi-&#xD;
~nian looked knowingly at the victim of all this badinage.&#xD;
- At this instant Annie looked up, and she was greeted&#xD;
by respectful- salutations, that would have been gracefully&#xD;
conspicuous at the~tournaments. of old.&#xD;
"I think," said Mildmay, as the party passed on, "that&#xD;
you are all quite merry with your tongues, but I see that&#xD;
you are also very envious in your hearts, ~as you have cause&#xD;
to be."&#xD;
&#xD;
A TALE OF SOUTHERN LIFE.           19&#xD;
"We are enviQus of course," said Marigny, "for&#xD;
we have made sour calculations, what a cozy 1~iine you&#xD;
will have of it,~with that fine old yellow brick mansion,&#xD;
shining out fro~rn among the magnolias; it will be quite re~&#xD;
fleshing in a new country to see a little hraldry, with the&#xD;
legitimate excuse, that you inherited it,.forldoubtif Miss&#xD;
Hastings would ever leave MaIden, unless she could take&#xD;
the old ho~ise away with here"&#xD;
"You will of course improve it with a wine-cellar and&#xD;
a billiard-room," suggested Calhoun; "for these are things&#xD;
that would in this Jericho pull down the walls but I&#xD;
think," he continued, "that they would stand unharmed,&#xD;
by such necessary associations, amid the free airs of the&#xD;
Mississippi valley."&#xD;
"And, besides, we might have expected this,"said Sin-&#xD;
gleton Minor; "for you remember, boys, how very eloquent&#xD;
Mildmay got, in the Society rooms, about the Goths com-&#xD;
ing down upon the fair fields of Italy! He se&amp;amp;ms to have&#xD;
a taste for these incursions into foreign lands. If. I could&#xD;
afford to sacrifice my inclinations to patriotisrn~I do not&#xD;
know but' that some. of these fair descendants of the&#xD;
'roundheads' might capture the last of a race of cavaliers.&#xD;
I must confess I have had my-traditional prejudices terri-&#xD;
bly shaken."&#xD;
"The way was prepared for this somewhat," said Cal-&#xD;
houn, turning to Singleton, "by your romantic affection&#xD;
for the daughter of either old General Fairfax, or Oliver&#xD;
Cromwdll,.-~--I forget which; you can turn to Carlyle at&#xD;
your leisure, and learn the particulars,"&#xD;
"And if you will leave the unintelligible author you&#xD;

s&#xD;

halve named, and read more English history," continued&#xD;
Calhoun, "you will find that this same staid daughter&#xD;
of Fairfax ~was, in time, the wildest duchess at the gay&#xD;
cOurt of *'the dissipated Charles; and this fact is what re-&#xD;
deem8* this puritanical human nature. The women are&#xD;
always more intelligent, more facile, and more patriotic&#xD;
than the men."&#xD;
"Gentlemen!" said Mildinay fii~al'ly, with some feel-&#xD;
ing; "your jests have the merit of wit, and perhaps of&#xD;
con~pliment; yet they trench somewhat' on personal&#xD;
gi~ound, 'because' suggested 'by, though not necessarily&#xD;
alluding to, a particular lady. I aiu sorry, however, to&#xD;
perceive," he continued, "that in spite of. your lon&amp;amp; resi-&#xD;
dence' here, you still make mental distinctions between the&#xD;
people of this great republic. I am for myself determined&#xD;
to kniw not1ain~ of the kind, and, above all; will 'I never&#xD;
allow prejudiced to conti~ol me, which originated with' the&#xD;
British nation centuries before we were "born."&#xD;
"Patriotism is not wholly dead, in' spite of. what disap-&#xD;
pointed politicians say," said Marigny, looking with real&#xD;
admiration at Mildmay; "but it is after' all," he' con-&#xD;
tinued, "the beautiful and good girls of this same sterile&#xD;
New England, who make us feel our homes are the same,&#xD;
w~iether North or South, and I say, may' Heaven bless&#xD;
themall!"&#xD;
".Treas&amp;amp;n is rife,-the South is in 'danger,-the Ama-&#xD;
zonsof the North conquer,-they rush upon' our defence.&#xD;
'less cohorts, and capture husbands with a precision ~that&#xD;
finds but a dim parallel in the red man lariating the wild&#xD;
horse on the prairie," returned Calhoun, at the same time&#xD;
&#xD;
taking the arm of Minor7 and gracefi~lly bowing, he turned&#xD;
into7 an obscure street, leaving Marigny and Mildmay&#xD;
together.&#xD;
Miidmay was annoyed; there wasp something in 'the&#xD;
half-concealed sneers of the reckless ~Calhoun, that caused&#xD;
a dark cloud to 'pass over his face: hia companion noticed&#xD;
it, and with some concern inquired,&#xD;
"Has any thing happened to offend you?"&#xD;
"Nothing,". said Mildmay, "that is personal to my-&#xD;
self; yet, nevertheless, I feel the, deepest chagrin and&#xD;
mortification that Calhoun, gifted as he, is, represents so&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
COLLEGE EXERCISES.&#xD;
AT an early hour of the morning, the usually quiet town of&#xD;
MaIden presented a scene of interesting excitement. Car-&#xD;
riages and footpassengers lined the highways, all moving&#xD;
towards one common 'centre. It was "Commencement&#xD;
Day.."&#xD;
The citizens generally -suspended business, that they&#xD;
might do honor to the celebration. Among the throng&#xD;
appeared grave and reverend gentlemen, who displayed a&#xD;
singular knowledge of the streets and college buildings,&#xD;
but were strangers to the citizens-these were "the boys of&#xD;
former years:" their greetiiigs with each other were cor-&#xD;
dial, and sometimes of painful interest; then there were a&#xD;
younger aPd more vigorous race, who had still many asso-&#xD;
ciations not destroyed by time, who still knew all the old&#xD;
shopkeepers, and many of the permanent residents of MaI-&#xD;
den: these were members of classes of quite recent times.&#xD;
Then there were juveniles, who had just entered upon&#xD;
their collegiate course, full of hope and full of fear, victims&#xD;
of many practical jokes, but merry withal.&#xD;
&#xD;
Then came the "boys in college," assuming airs fr&amp;amp;m&#xD;
their superiority of knowing what was, going on,-wheti&#xD;
came off the speeches,-who were to make, them,-aud&#xD;
what "societies" would gain the most distinguished&#xD;
honors. Then there was the "graduating class,"-its&#xD;
members generally happy, and over dressed, running to&#xD;
and fro, as connected with ~all sorts of incomprehensible&#xD;
committees; hunting up stray musicians, spurring on in-&#xD;
dolent landlords and heavy carpenters, and fretting and&#xD;
fuming generally, as they should, on such important oeca-&#xD;
Bioris.&#xD;
Prominent in the scene were the professors of the cal-&#xD;
lege, arrayed in a suit that never made its appearance~&#xD;
but once in a year,-looking ineffably pleased, and seem-&#xD;
ingly as awkward and embarrassed in the confusion as the&#xD;
just initiated freshmen themselves; laborious, and gener-&#xD;
ally conscientious men, but who seem to feel it is no stretch&#xD;
of truth to tell a thousand anxious parents, that "their&#xD;
boys" are the best in school, and the only ones "that give&#xD;
no trouble they looking the while careworn, and feeling&#xD;
their souls sunken into despondency, by the undutiful&#xD;
goings on of these very objects of so much maternal solici-&#xD;
tude and professorial compliment. -&#xD;
Lastly, there is the "old Prex," with his gray hair,&#xD;
and frosty face, moving about like a father among his&#xD;
children, relaxed from his usual dignity, for his heart is&#xD;
really pained that he is soon to bid adieu to many that he&#xD;
loves, however severe he may have seemed. Good and&#xD;
generous old man! he moves across the college-green,----&#xD;

&#xD;
nera wave,-the music splits the ear with discordant&#xD;
sounds,-and the procession forms and winds its way to&#xD;
the church,' where the orations are to be delivered, and the&#xD;
degrees conferred.&#xD;
The gay throng passes by, and what a glorious sight!&#xD;
They go not armed with the musket and sword, but with&#xD;
the vivifying power of knowledge: there are before you&#xD;
veterans in the cause of learning, as well as the just en-&#xD;
listed volunteer.&#xD;
We kept with them our joyous step, and remember well&#xD;
the thrill of pleasure that filled our heart, as we performed&#xD;
our part in the peaceful pageantry; we have since helped&#xD;
make out the heavy tread of desolating soldiery; we have&#xD;
shouted, as we have, aided in carrying our country's flag&#xD;
upon the battlements of our nation's foes'; we have' wit-&#xD;
nessed the fearful cost~ of such a triumph, and heard the&#xD;
loud acclaim of a nation's admirLation ;-yet, for all this, the&#xD;
sunshiny bands that issue annually from our collegiate&#xD;
halls, and under the regis of peace, pursue their useful&#xD;
triumphs, do more' for the real glory of their country than&#xD;
all the more showy, and more attractive sons of war.&#xD;
how gay the old church looks! The altar is hidden&#xD;
by the well carpeted stage;' the galleries are crowded&#xD;
with bright faces of beauty, and every where arc to be&#xD;
seen the fond parents and the &amp;amp;ting sisters, of those who&#xD;
have allotted parts in the exercises of the day. Long it&#xD;
seems they have waited, but anon the distant music is heard,&#xD;
and the whisper goes through the expectant assemblage that&#xD;
"they come;" presently, the faculty, the trustees, the&#xD;
graduates, the students, each in turn, make their appear-&#xD;
&#xD;
ance, and the body of the vast building is completely&#xD;
filled. The band strikes up an enlivening air; the strains&#xD;
die away% when some appointed patriarch rises from his&#xD;
scat, and in solemn tones, offers upa prayer of thanksgiv-&#xD;
ing to the common Father of all.&#xD;
The student must, in his career through the world, act&#xD;
in more exciting scenes; he may himself, in time, preside&#xD;
over these very same ceremonies, or as a learned judge, or&#xD;
powerful statesman, become involved in acts, the solemni-&#xD;
ties of which are connected with more important relations,&#xD;
'but he will remember more vividly than all else besides,&#xD;
the opening of his Commencement Day celebration; it is&#xD;
the first step he takes upon the road of life, where to turn&#xD;
back is impossible, while yet the future is all uncertainty.&#xD;
Reynolds Calhoun and Graham Mildmay were evidently&#xD;
not only the popular orators with the students, but with&#xD;
the people. The first named had selected for his theme&#xD;
"The defence of the South;" the last mentioned, "The&#xD;
importance of a liberal education t~ the American stu-&#xD;
dent."&#xD;
Jt had been whispered about, that both these young&#xD;
men had, under different names, travelled over almost the&#xD;
very same ground, and a deep anxiety was manifested, to&#xD;
hear what was presumed would be the bold and brilliant&#xD;
philippic of Calhoun, and the calm 'and close reasoning of the&#xD;
deep, but more reflective Mildmay; it may be judged there~&#xD;
fore, what was the disappointment of all, when the Presi-&#xD;
detd announced that,&#xD;
"Reynolds Calhoun was excused."&#xD;
"As I feared," whispered Mildmay to Adolph Ma-&#xD;

profound statesmanship, and the happiest diction, charac-&#xD;
terized his theme. Calhoun wrought it out under the heat&#xD;
inspired by some unjust and bitter anti-southern remarks he&#xD;
heard in the street, but the excitement gone, he has not&#xD;
had energy enough left to repeat it here, where alone it&#xD;
could be useful, and where alone he could make himself&#xD;
felt in defence."&#xD;
The degrees were conferred, the pleasant excitement&#xD;
ceased, and Graham Mildmay stood before the audience.&#xD;
As valedictorian, he had stamped upon himself, Without&#xD;
creating envy or rivals, the claim of superior scholarship&#xD;
over all the members of his class.-this was no small honor&#xD;
-but he was, as we have already hinted, a favorite with&#xD;
the people of the town, hi~ early history was known, and&#xD;
it was more than usually interesting. From circumstances&#xD;
peculiar to himself, he had. mingle{raore in society than&#xD;
any of the other students, and the fact that he was so soon&#xD;
by separation, to be almost entirely lost to his early friends,&#xD;
gave unusual interest to his appearance.&#xD;
Annie Hastings occupied a seat that commanded a per-&#xD;
fect view of the stage, but was out of sight herself. As&#xD;
th~ tall form of Nildmay rose before her, she felt con-&#xD;
founded with herself, upon perceiving that her face burned&#xD;
and her heart audibly beat.&#xD;
"It must be the warmth of the rcom," thought she,&#xD;
while endeavoring to catch more air from her waving fan,&#xD;
for she continued,"II was never more oppressed in my&#xD;
life."&#xD;
Mildmay, in his address, rapidly and clearly surveyed&#xD;
&#xD;
A TALE OF SOUTHERN LIFE.             2'7&#xD;
&#xD;
what he conceived to be the popular prejudices of' the peo-&#xD;
pie of the North against the South, and her peculiar insti-&#xD;
tutions. He showed how slavery had been entailed upon&#xD;
the States by no choice of those whom Providence had se-&#xD;
lected to bear its responsibilities, and expatiated upon its&#xD;
patriarchal7 and to the dependent, protective character.&#xD;
He then treated of its moral influence upon society,&#xD;
denied that it weakened a love of liberty in the master,&#xD;
and illustrated his position by showing, that the leader*&#xD;
of our revolution, and a galaxy of the highest names of&#xD;
that interesting period of our national history, were of the&#xD;
South.&#xD;
He next dwelt upon the necessity of encouraging a pa-&#xD;
ternal regard for the whole country, of taking liberal and&#xD;
enlightened views of ~all questions which treated of the di-&#xD;
versified interests which came under the notice of the&#xD;
American citiren, and ~ongratiAated himself upon the fact,&#xD;
that although his home and his worldly interests were in the&#xD;
distant South, he had, by the accident of his education,&#xD;
learned to love and understand the people of the North.&#xD;
Addressing particularly the students of the college, he&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"Your leading and pervading thought should be, a&#xD;
contemplation of the stupendous country of which you are&#xD;
soon to be active citizens. If you find your sentiments&#xD;
cramped by sectionality, contemplate its vastness; if you&#xD;
lack enthusiasm, regard its glorious destiny.&#xD;
"Remember that the fierce winds which revel about the&#xD;
great lakes, and in winter sweep down the Aroostook, are&#xD;
tempered in their southward course by the balmy airs of&#xD;

the Mexican Gulf, and the heats of the Rio Grande. We&#xD;
hear the dashing surge of the wild Atlantic, as it beats&#xD;
against ourrook.~bound coast on the east, and while we listen,&#xD;
it is answered back in milder accents by the Pacific's wave&#xD;
in the west.&#xD;
But," he continued, "our physical strength, vast as&#xD;
it is, extending over almost a continent, is surpassed in&#xD;
interest and real importance by our moral culture. The&#xD;
little school-house that nestles~in the corner of the road,&#xD;
contains a hidden strength, which far surpasses in power&#xD;
the wealth of our soil, or the mere geographical extent of&#xD;
our empire.&#xD;
"Education, the parent of liberty,-whose influence&#xD;
withers kings, and consumes as with fire the power of the&#xD;
oppressor, finds a place among us, whether it be in the cot-&#xD;
tage of the poor man, or the pr6ud mansion of the rich.&#xD;
"We walk forth in the ennobling consciousness of&#xD;
sovereign power. We feel individually responsible for&#xD;
the administration of our Government; its emoluments, its&#xD;
honors, its glory, and its future, are in our individual keep-&#xD;
ing. If we strive to perfectly perform our task, we will&#xD;
leave as a heritage our own republican institutions."&#xD;
Raving concluded his literary exercise, amidst the&#xD;
wildest plaudits of a delighted auditory, he addressed sev-&#xD;
erally the "Senate,"-the "Professors,".-then turning to&#xD;
the venerable President, who was already dissolved in tears&#xD;
of heartfelt admiration, he continued, "My father! to you&#xD;
I owe an ever to be unpaid debt of gratitude. Your kind&#xD;

tant and future home, SUQIL a well-founded determination? to&#xD;
honor your memory, that I shall in time, like yourself com-&#xD;
mand the respect of my fellow-citizens, and have it ac-&#xD;
corded to me, that I am not wholly useless in my day and&#xD;
generation.&#xD;
"To you; my classmates, what can I say? Fare-&#xD;
well, is the most expressive word-but yet how feeble,&#xD;
and how truly inadequate, to convey the feelings of my&#xD;
heart. Remember, as you struggle for fame, the associa-&#xD;
tions of to-day, and always feel, that we are a family of&#xD;
brothers, scattered by necessity, not from choice-we have&#xD;
already the responsibilities of American citizens resting&#xD;
upon us, and if we fulfil them well, the most exalted dig-&#xD;
nity is ours. Again I say, farewell! "..&#xD;
Upon the breaking up of the vast assembly, Mildmay&#xD;
was surrounded by innumerable well wishers, who shook&#xD;
him by the hand, congratulated him upon his address, and&#xD;
expressed admiration of his personal and intellectual quali-&#xD;
ties.&#xD;
For all these attentions he returned his thanks, with a&#xD;
manner so charming and so sincere, that he captivated all,&#xD;
as the most promising student that ever left the protection&#xD;
of the old college; and while the young and enthusiastic&#xD;
saw the future hero in Mildmay, the old and reflective&#xD;
marked out for him a life of exalted usefulness, that was&#xD;
one day, by its perfection, to make his name familiar with&#xD;
the great and important interests of the world.&#xD;

THE MASTER'S HOUSES&#xD;
CHAPTER ilL&#xD;
fl~~OIDENT5 OF MILDMAY'5 EARLY HISTORY.&#xD;
Oi~i the evening following the exercises of "Commence-&#xD;
ment," the residence of Dr. Elliott was thrown open, and&#xD;
there assembled under its hospitable roof the friends of&#xD;
the college of Malden, together with the alumni of the in-&#xD;
stitution. The ceremony of reception being over, Dr.&#xD;
Elliott, and a few old friends, found themselves~ seated&#xD;
in a quiet place upon one of the spacious galleries that&#xD;
surrounded the house, and there rested from the fatigues&#xD;
of the day.&#xD;
"You promised," said one of the visitors to Dr. El-&#xD;
liott,"that you would give us some reminiscences of&#xD;
young Mildmay, who has created such a sensation in his&#xD;
favor, as the orator of the day; let us know something,&#xD;
Doctor, of his personal history."&#xD;
The kind-hearted instructor assented; an~ leaning&#xD;
back on his well-cushioned easy chair, he related what&#xD;
follows.&#xD;
"It is now nearly twelve years ago, that I was one&#xD;
evening sitting in my parlor, at my old boarding-school,&#xD;
&#xD;
A TALE OF SOUTHERN LIPE.           31&#xD;
when I heard a knock, and getting up to~ see who wa~ de-&#xD;
siring to come into the house, I met in the hail a lady,&#xD;
dressed in deep mourning, and leading by the hand a deli.&#xD;
cate-looking lad.&#xD;
"After the usual compliments of meeting, she an-&#xD;
nounced herself as a resident ok' North Carolina; she&#xD;
stated that she was a widow, and that the lad was her&#xD;
only son. She also said, that as he was heir to a large&#xD;
estate, she felt the importance of his receiving such an&#xD;
education, as would enable him in the best manner to dis-&#xD;
charge the responsible duties that would eventually de-&#xD;
volve upon him. She added, that through a respected&#xD;
neighbor, a former pupil of mine, she was acquainted with&#xD;
my capacity (she was pleased to say) t~ teach, and trust-&#xD;
worthiness as a guardian of her child.&#xD;
"Nothing she said would have enabled her to make the&#xD;
sacrifice of being parted from him, although fully convinced&#xD;
of its propriety, but the fact, that it was the often ex-&#xD;
pressed injunction of Graham's father, that he should at a&#xD;
suitable age be placed in a school at the North, and there&#xD;
remain until his education was complete.&#xD;
"The separation of the mother from her child was&#xD;
one of the most painful things that I ever witnessed.&#xD;
After repeated attempts to take formal leave, she was&#xD;
finally obliged to steal away while he was asleep, and then&#xD;
hurried from Mald~n for fear that her heart would compel&#xD;
her to return.&#xD;
"The lad I found of. a good, but at times self-willed&#xD;
disposition; but as his mind expanded, he seemed to com-&#xD;
prehend in a remarkable degree how much his mother had&#xD;

&#xD;
THE MASTER'S IIOUSE&#xD;
&#xD;
sacrificed that he might receive the advantages of a good&#xD;
education, and, it would appear, that lie had at an early&#xD;
day determined to achieve a triumph.&#xD;
"The declining health of the mother, who had each&#xD;
successive year visited Maiden, finally~ assumed a' fatal&#xD;
character; and by some temporary derangement of the&#xD;
mails, the news of her decease did not reach Malden until&#xD;
nearly two weeks after the sad event. From that time I&#xD;
felt an additional interest in the success of Graham&#xD;
Mildmay.&#xD;
"Upon the very day on which he was examined and&#xD;
declared to be well prepared to enter the freshman class&#xD;
of the college, I was by the partiality of my friei~ds&#xD;
elected to the honored office of its President, so that Gra-&#xD;
ham still continued a member of my family, even up to&#xD;
the present time; but to-day," said the Doctor? his voice&#xD;
husky with emotion, "he has, with his college honors,&#xD;
taken the place of a man in the wide world, and I lose&#xD;
one of the best of pupils,-.and I will add, one of the&#xD;
most esteemed friends it has ever been my fortune to&#xD;
know.&#xD;
"As a teacher, and I may say, parent of Graham, I&#xD;
have endeavored to conscientiouslyxperform every promise&#xD;
made to his excellent mother, and I think he now presents&#xD;
to the world, a youth, of whom any fond father or doting&#xD;
mother might be proud."&#xD;
This exhibition of pardonable pride in the Doctor, as&#xD;
he reflected upon the exercises of the day, and recalled the&#xD;
triumph~ of his ~rot4g4, was sympathized in by all of his&#xD;
auditors, and the conversation took a general character, the&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
{..&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
burden of which was, Graham's future, which was prophe-&#xD;
sied would be a brilliant and useful career.&#xD;
While the good Dr. Elliott was dwelling upon the&#xD;
history of his muchdoved pupil, Mildmay was sitting in&#xD;
the imposing parlor of the Hastings House. Years ago&#xD;
had he first entered that old mansion, a thoughtless boy.&#xD;
In all times since then he had beenreceived like a dis-&#xD;
tant relation of the family, and was treated by the elderly&#xD;
members almost as a child; but it seemed to him, that now&#xD;
that he had graduated, a new spirit, and strange responsi-&#xD;
bilities possessed him.&#xD;
Instead of running up the steps, as was his usual cus-&#xD;
tom, he walked as gravely as any Hastings could, into the&#xD;
hall, where he met Annie,'and, involuntarily, he gave the&#xD;
formal greeting of" Miss hastings."&#xD;
"Miss, indeed," echoed Annie7 half amused, and half&#xD;
surprised.&#xD;
"Yes, Miss Hastings," said Mildmay, a strange sensa~&#xD;
tion of bewilderment coming over his mind.&#xD;
"Upon my word," said the fair girl, with one of her&#xD;
merry laughs, "because you were the hero to-day, does it&#xD;
necessarily follow that your language must move on. stilts."&#xD;
"Not at all," returned Mildmay, as the two seated&#xD;
themselves in the parlor, his voice softened almost to a&#xD;
whisper, "but, Miss Hastings-Annie, I mean, are you&#xD;
aware, that ]I leave MaIden to-morrow, and do. you think&#xD;
that such a separation can be made. without any deep emo-&#xD;
tion on my part?"&#xD;
"I have no doubt you will feel deep regret at leaving&#xD;

&#xD;
Dr. Elliott," said Annie, apparently very much occupied&#xD;
in arranging a bouquet of flowers on a table near by.&#xD;
," I shall, as you say, feel deep regret at parting with&#xD;
Dr. Elliott, although I had not particularly recurred be-&#xD;
fore to the fact," returned Mildmay, a little surprised him-&#xD;
self at the reflection.&#xD;
"~Then you are certainly very ungrateful," said Annie,&#xD;
with a playfulness she evidently did not feel.&#xD;
"Perhaps I am," replied Mildmay; "but Annie," he&#xD;
continued, "with the necessity of leaving Malden, I have&#xD;
most thought of leaving you. Malden has been for years&#xD;
my home,-within its precincts are many of my most vivid&#xD;
and pleasant recollections; but if I cannot take with me&#xD;
the assurance that I am held in esteem by you, and also&#xD;
the hope that I can return at some future time, and claim&#xD;
a higher place than friendship in your affections, then upon&#xD;
my departure will I be wretched indeed."&#xD;
"You have certainly changed very much since yester-&#xD;
day, Graham," said Annie, maintaining her presence of&#xD;
mind, and controlling her feelings, "for to my knowledge,"&#xD;
ehe continued, "you have been longing to get free from&#xD;
the summons of the college bell-those hateful professors-&#xD;
and, if your compliments at our tea table are not all pre-&#xD;
tence, still more hateful commons."&#xD;
"True," answered Graham, "such should be my re-&#xD;
joicing, but it is not so; my ~fellow-students, when they&#xD;
abandon their almc&amp;amp; mctte~r, have warmer mothers to greet&#xD;
them, and a thousand long-neglected home associations to&#xD;
revive, but I have neither one nor the other. Away from&#xD;
Malden, and I leave my most cherished friends behind me,&#xD;
&#xD;
and shall be a perfect stranger, even where my worldly&#xD;
interests are all centered, and where in the order of Provi-&#xD;
dence IF must find a home."&#xD;
"True, true," replied Annie, her face full of sympathy,&#xD;
"what you say is true, but," she suggested, "will you not&#xD;
soon be in your distant South, and there find charms&#xD;
enough in those bright Hebe eyes we read about as so pe-&#xD;
culiar to a tropical clime, to make you soon, very soon for-&#xD;
get the chilly atmosphere of our cold climate, and the awk-&#xD;
wardly expressed friendships of our colder hearts."&#xD;
"Do not say colder hearts, Annie," said Mildmay, seiz~&#xD;
ing her unresisting hand, "say not even iiidifferent ones,&#xD;
for I have long indulged a hope that I may have awakened&#xD;
an interest in your affections, that might in time change&#xD;
from passing interest into love."&#xD;
"Graham," said Annie, her eyes swimming in confii-&#xD;
sion, "could I have been spared this acknowledgment on&#xD;
your part, it would have saved me a great deal of paii4 but&#xD;
how much more I should have felt, had you left Malden&#xD;
without this acknowledgment of esteem, I dare not say."&#xD;
"Say not esteem, Annie," returned Mildimay, "say&#xD;
nothing if you can find no more genial word; rather let&#xD;
your silence give me the hope your tongue would deny.~~&#xD;
"Graham," said Annie, the tears ~struggling in her&#xD;
eyes, "what hold in the future can our plain New England&#xD;
home retain upon one who has so wide a field of active&#xD;
life before him. I dare not indulge the thought, Graham,&#xD;
that you will not illustrate the proverbial fickleness ofv col-&#xD;
lege friendships.~~&#xD;
"Then," said Graham, with an energy that startled&#xD;

&#xD;
Annie almost with alarm, "then you are not prepared to&#xD;
do justice to the truest heart that ever beat with love!&#xD;
Annie, my sentiments, are not the growth of an hour, a&#xD;
caprice of a day; almost from the time we first met, have I&#xD;
indulged the ambitious hope of calling you at some future&#xD;
time my own"&#xD;
At this frank declaration, not altogether unexpected,&#xD;
from the vague communings of Annie's inmost thoughts,&#xD;
she withdrew her hand from Graham, and bent her eyes&#xD;
for a moment on the ground, then recovering herself, she&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"You may ascribe my conduct, Graham, to coldness,&#xD;
rather than education, but you know I have been raised to&#xD;
cultivate a self.sacrificing spirit. I dare not be too enthusb&#xD;
astic, dare not hope too much; therefore, Graham, speak&#xD;
only of friendship, not of love.&#xD;
"I will do all that you please," said Graham, his face&#xD;
expressing joy; "only tell me," he continued, "that at&#xD;
some future time you will give me hope."&#xD;
"Two years hence," said Annie, placing her hand in&#xD;
Graham's, "you will find me with a heart as free as now,&#xD;
and still Annie Hastings. If at the end of that time your&#xD;
college preferences are confirmed, in spite of your expe-&#xD;
rience in the world, then Graham, and not till then, offer&#xD;
me your heart."&#xD;
"And may I, in that long probation, write to you,&#xD;
Annie, from my southern home?" said Graham, staring&#xD;
int&amp;amp;her pure face as if he would see her very soul.&#xD;
"You may write, Graham, as we have in times past&#xD;
talked; we shall all be glad to hear from you, and I am&#xD;
&#xD;
H&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
sure Dr. Elliott will let you often hear from your friends&#xD;
in Nalden."&#xD;
"Enough, enough," said Graham, passionately, press-&#xD;
ing Annie's stilt imprisoned hand to his heart, and ii~i-&#xD;
printing an unresisted kiss upon her forehead. "Enough,&#xD;
Annie," he again repeated. "And now," he OQiltinued,&#xD;
with animation, "the two long years of my probation&#xD;
shall be laboriously, but, because of your existence, hope-&#xD;
fully spent. - In that time I will have assumed full control&#xD;
of my long neglected estate; the cares of business will be&#xD;
lights because they. are to be crowned with such a reward.&#xD;
I already feel-"&#xD;
"No more!" said Annie, playfully interrupting him,&#xD;
"let us talk of other things."&#xD;
The many words that were spoken in the long conversa-&#xD;
tion that ensued, would to others appear cold an4 common-&#xD;
place, hut they were used only to beguile the ear of two&#xD;
young and hopeful beings, who uttered their real thoughts&#xD;
with their eyes, and responded through the deeper sympa-&#xD;
thy of united hearts.&#xD;

OHAPTE1~ IV.&#xD;
MILDMAY PURCHASES "HERITAGE PLACE.~~&#xD;
MILDMAY, from the time that his mother died, had~ each&#xD;
succeeding spring, passed two or three weeks on his plan-&#xD;
tation, and in that way was somewhat acquainted with the&#xD;
duties connected with his future career. His business had&#xD;
been, in his long absence at the North, all things consid-&#xD;
ered, carefully attended to; and upon his arrival~ at home,&#xD;
after a due celebration by the negroes, of "Master's re-&#xD;
turn," Mildmay was soon involved in the serious duties of&#xD;
life, and the novelty of his situation softened any 8evere&#xD;
regrets he felt for the scenes he had left at Malden."&#xD;
Graham once at home, he occupied most of his leisure&#xD;
time in writing letters to his old master, in which he gave&#xD;
interesting details of his new pursuits, and at~ising de-&#xD;
scriptions of the incidents of plantation life. These lef-&#xD;
ters were received by the worthy Dr. Elliott, and carefully&#xD;
perused, and then. quietly handed over to some member ~if&#xD;
tht~ "Hastings family," with the remark, "that, perhaps,&#xD;
something from our young friend, Mildmay, would not be&#xD;
uninteresting."&#xD;
&#xD;
With conscientious regularity, did, the Doctor answer&#xD;
these friendly epistles. He had been made Mildmay's&#xD;
confidant in all that related to Annie Hastings, and c~r~&#xD;
dially approving of the proposed union, without inter-&#xD;
fering, or in any way encouraging the intermediate steps,&#xD;
he had promised to act as we have seen, as the mediinn of&#xD;
communication, but not until fully authorized so to do, by&#xD;
the family of the CC old Hastings House."&#xD;
Whatever were 'Annie's feelings, no one but herself&#xD;
knew; it was noticeable among the members o ~ her house-&#xD;
hold, that upon receiving the Doctor's letters 'from Mild-&#xD;
may, she spent a longer time than usual in her room, and&#xD;
that those same epistles were never seen or hear4 of, after&#xD;
being once given into her possession. But, as the Doctor&#xD;
wrote to his former pupil, "Annie seemed entirely ab-&#xD;
sorbed in household affair, and in reading, and of late had&#xD;
visited even less than -usuaL" There was, in truth, a. quiet&#xD;
and dignified calmness about her manner, that met with&#xD;
the most cordial approbation from her staid relations.&#xD;
Month after month quickly passed away, as Graham&#xD;
each day found new matters to occupy his 'attention. His&#xD;
confidential and trusty business man, Mr. Fenwick~'who&#xD;
had so well managed the estate during Grah~m~s minority,&#xD;
was anxious now to resign his trust into Graham's h~nde,&#xD;
preparatory to commencing business upon his own account.&#xD;
Graham also found, that'the lands he 'occupied, as well&#xD;
as those about him, had been worn out by long cultivation,&#xD;
and that he was really living in ,a deserted country. From&#xD;
Mr. Fenwick he learned the fact, that his- fa1~har, at the&#xD;
time of his death, had m~de preparations to remove farther&#xD;

&#xD;
A TALE OF. SOUTHERN LIFE.        41&#xD;
&#xD;
south, and as such an act was more than ever demanded,&#xD;
he determined at once to set about the necessary prepara-&#xD;
tions.                     /&#xD;
Graham, as will be seen, had no particular attachment&#xD;
to the "home place," and he looked forward with romantic&#xD;
interest to th~ founding of one himself, one worthy, as he&#xD;
thought, of Annie; a home in a new and vigorous State,-.&#xD;
where he could rise with its fortwies, and identify his name&#xD;
with its prosperity.&#xD;
With this noble ambition, and accompanied by Mr. Fen-&#xD;
wick, and fortified with letters from the best men of his&#xD;
native State, in the course of a few days, Mildmay was sail-&#xD;
ing down 'the~river Mississippi on his way to New Orleans.&#xD;
The solemn grandeur of the mighty Father of Waters made&#xD;
a deep impression upon him, but still more was he affected&#xD;
as he witnessed the evidences of progress, the rapid strides&#xD;
of civilization. His soul fairly expanded as he contempla-&#xD;
ted the developments of the future, and in the enthusiasm&#xD;
of the moment he thanked 0od, that he had been born to&#xD;
witness and take a part in the scenes around him.&#xD;
Arriving at his place of destination in the month of&#xD;
December, he could hardly realize the fact, that the same&#xD;
season of year, whieh at Malden bound every thing in&#xD;
ice and snow, in Louisiana decked every thing in the most&#xD;
lovely vegetation, and breathed the balmy airs, of a ge-&#xD;
nial spring.&#xD;
For a few days Mildmay abandoned himself to the nov-&#xD;
elties presented by the anomalous character of the south-&#xD;
ern metropolis. His extensive reading prepared him to ap-&#xD;
preciate the strange architecture he met in the older parts&#xD;
&#xD;
[4&#xD;
&#xD;
of the city, and his curiosity was excited and gratified by the&#xD;
Babel-like confusion that prevailed among the tongues and&#xD;
the people comprising the motley population.&#xD;
Upon the broad and no-where-eke to be seen "levee,"&#xD;
he beheld in amazement, the accumulating agricultural&#xD;
wealth of the great valley of a mighty continent He saw&#xD;
piled up before him for miles, the sugar, the cotton, the&#xD;
corn, and the tobacco,~-treasures taken from the fields,&#xD;
yet, in vying abundance, there reposed side by side, vast&#xD;
piles of mineral wealth, of leat, of iron, of copper, dug from&#xD;
the embowelled earth.&#xD;
Assembled in the magnificent halls of his sumptuous&#xD;
hotel, he found, constantly before his eye, representatives&#xD;
of all nations, each endeavoring to best display his superi-&#xD;
ority; Jut it was among the Southerners, who seemed to&#xD;
carry their hearts in their hand, and who were, as the rep-&#xD;
resentatives of the great planting interests, identified with&#xD;
himself that he found the marked men of the multitude-&#xD;
the cordially-acknowledged princes of the croWd.&#xD;
To this latter class Mildmay, who resembled them in&#xD;
person, was insensibly drawn by a thousand chords of sym-&#xD;
pathy, that had heretofore slumbered in his breast. He&#xD;
heard them speak of their crops, of their negroes, of, their&#xD;
plantations; he saw their lavish expenditure of money; wit-&#xD;
nessed the respect they commandedfrom all who conversed&#xD;
with them, and there rose in his bosom a consciousness of&#xD;
self-importance, which gave a new dignity to his carriage,&#xD;
and a wider range to his thoughts.&#xD;
Fenwick, who was a practical sort of character, very&#xD;
soon made some. congenial acquaintances, and with them,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC8057-00000021"/>&#xD;
lie visited the neighboring plantations, and he could not&#xD;
suppress his enthusiasm at the richness of the vegetation&#xD;
he witnessed, and the easy' manner with which. they were&#xD;
made to produce an abundant crop, compared to the more&#xD;
sterile soil of North C~rolina.&#xD;
It soon became knQwn among those interested, what&#xD;
Mildmay's business was, and offers of land came pouring in&#xD;
upon him, from a hundred quarters. Whole principalities&#xD;
were offered him in Texas, at nominal rates. -Half opened&#xD;
plantations high up some s1~ll unfamiliar river, upon any&#xD;
terms he might choose to offer, but as the "location" came&#xD;
nearer New Orleans, the prices increased, until at~last they&#xD;
reached enormous sums.&#xD;
*Among the acquaintances that Fenwick had picked up&#xD;
about the hotel, was a tall and rather attractive-looking&#xD;
individual, who rejoiced in the cognomen of Major Dixon.&#xD;
This Major Dixon was exceedingly affable, knew exactly the&#xD;
value of Degroes, the prices of cotton and sugar, and seem-&#xD;
ed to be acquainted, from personal observation, with every&#xD;
bit of available land that was for sale, not only in Louisia-&#xD;
na and North Carolina, but in half the Southern States.&#xD;
TQ Fenwick, the Major was particularly attentive;&#xD;
though he did not seen indifferent, still he made no approach&#xD;
to speak with Mildmay, and it was not until Fenwick had&#xD;
dwelt in eloquent terms upon the value of the acquaintance,&#xD;
that Mildmay permitted himself to }~e introduced.&#xD;
Major Dixon had a dashing off-hand manner, talked a&#xD;
great deal of good 'sense, but occasionally shocked Mild.&#xD;
may's sensibilities by a remark, which showed either a want&#xD;
of knowledge of the true use of words, or else an exceed~&#xD;
ingly callous heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
42&#xD;
&#xD;
42              THE MASTER'S HOUSE:                                                      A TALE OF S0UThIER~T LIFE.          43&#xD;
&#xD;
Upon the subject of purchasing a plantation Major&#xD;
Dixon afforded much real information, for Mildmay found&#xD;
that his opinions were verified by gentleman, to whom he&#xD;
had letters of credit and introduction, and there soon sprung&#xD;
up quite an exchange of time and conversation between Mild-&#xD;
may and the affable) knowing, and always apparently at leis-&#xD;
ure, Major Dixon.&#xD;
That the acquaintance was respectable Mildmay 'did&#xD;
not doubt, for he found that gentlemen, who had been point-&#xD;
ed out to him by the communicative clerk of the hotel, as&#xD;
some of the wealthiest planters of the State, frequently&#xD;
were with Dixon in some obscure corner engaged in long&#xD;
and apparently confidential conversations. Mildniay deter-&#xD;
mined to solve the mystery, and commissioned Fenwick to&#xD;
learn who the attentive Major Dixon was.&#xD;
Each day that Mildmay spent in New Orleans, he en-&#xD;
larged his circle of acquaintances, and finally accepted. one&#xD;
or two invitations to visit wealthy planters living ~the&#xD;
coast." The more he saw of the country and the people&#xD;
the more he was delighted; and he returned to his hotel&#xD;
from hi~ suburban trips, inspired with the determination&#xD;
to select a place at the earliest practicable moment, hasten&#xD;
home, and complete the laborious business of moving the&#xD;
accessories of a large plantation. -&#xD;
Among "the bargains" offered him, was ,one situated&#xD;
some two hundred miles or more above New Orleans, not&#xD;
directly upon the river, but presenting a remarkably fine&#xD;
body of land, on one of the many tributaries emptying'into&#xD;
the Mississippi.&#xD;
To this place Mildmay was particularly attracted, frem&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
the fact, that it was placed for sale in the hands of an agent&#xD;
of the most responsible character, had already built upon&#xD;
it a fine mansion, and an abundance of negro cabins; in&#xD;
faat required nothing, as the advertis aenti~erted, but a&#xD;
"respectable force" to combine all the requirements of a&#xD;
"first class place."&#xD;
~NIIajor Dixon knew all about the piece of land alluded&#xD;
to, and gave Mildmay a minute, and, as it afterwards proved,&#xD;
correct description of it.&#xD;
Ale stated that it was originally opened by a wealthy&#xD;
man from South Carolina, Who had ideas of style rather&#xD;
beyond his means1 and became so involved by bi~ many&#xD;
improvements, that he at last abandoned the property in&#xD;
disgust, and threw it upon the hands of those who had&#xD;
been most liberal in loaning ifim money.&#xD;
"With fifty good hands," said Dixon, in conclusion of his&#xD;
remarks, "in two years the 'Heritage Place' can be made&#xD;
one Df the most profitable properties in the country."&#xD;
Mildmay and his companion Fenwick left New Orleans,&#xD;
and with an agent of the owners of the "Heritage Place,"&#xD;
they took a small steamer, and for more than a day pro-&#xD;
gressed up the Mississippi River. Sometime in the night,&#xD;
while Mildmay was asleep, the boat shot into "a bayou,"&#xD;
and in professional parlance "laid up," until the following&#xD;
morning, and soon after Mild may made his appearance, it&#xD;
commenced moving between narrowing shores, along which&#xD;
could occasionally be seen improved plantations, and the&#xD;
innumerable laborers at their daily work.&#xD;
The country, though flat, was as beautiful and as rich&#xD;
in agricultural wealth as could be imagined. T4wards npon&#xD;
&#xD;
44&#xD;
&#xD;
A TALE OF SOUThERN LIFE.          45&#xD;
the little steamer, that went but three or four miles an hour,&#xD;
ran its bows into the landing at "Heritage Place," and&#xD;
leaving Mildmay and his friends, passed on its way, with&#xD;
the understanding, that in the course of the afternoon it&#xD;
would pick them up as it returned back to New Orleans.&#xD;
Two or three acres distant from the shores of "the&#xD;
bayou," was a fine stately-looking dwelling, so massive, that&#xD;
it really had an imposing appearance. It had never been&#xD;
entirely finished, and already signs of decay were seen upon&#xD;
the brick pillars that supported the capacious ver~ndahs.&#xD;
In front and rear could be traced the old lines of what&#xD;
was once carefully planted shrubbery; and one or two sour&#xD;
orange-trees, in spite of neglect, were covered with ripened&#xD;
fruit. The fences were more or less broken down,-iu&#xD;
fact, every thing had a desolate appearance.&#xD;
Some half mile, in the rear, were twenty partially&#xD;
finished negro cabins, and other plantation out-buildings.&#xD;
It seemed as if some enterprising, and more than usually&#xD;
ambitious person, had commenced all these costly improve-&#xD;
ments, and just as they were about being completed, had&#xD;
suddenly abandoned them to destruction.&#xD;
Fenwick, by the assistance of the agent, had borrowed&#xD;
a couple of horses from a neighboring plantation, and he&#xD;
and Mildmay rode over the "opened land."&#xD;
They were gone some two or three hours, and the re-&#xD;
sult of the ride had left upon both decidedly~a favorable&#xD;
impression. Fenwick showed how little work it would be&#xD;
to restore things to tolerable order, and~ how inaycaror&#xD;
so, Mildmay could have a place, that would outvie any&#xD;
thing he had ever dreamt of in his native State.&#xD;

&#xD;
Meanwhile, an overseer from an adjoining plantation&#xD;
had come over to see what was going on; and meeting the&#xD;
agent, and learning the particulars, he went in pursuit of&#xD;
Mildmay, and offered his services, and volunteered any&#xD;
information regarding the value of the property. This&#xD;
person and Fenwick became* at once cosy and confidential,&#xD;
and he gave not only a history of the plantation in ques-&#xD;
tion, but also of the country round about.&#xD;
It would~ seems that portions of it had been opened&#xD;
many years, and was almost entirely occupied by wealthy&#xD;
people, and in the vicinity were living some of the most&#xD;
influential men in the country. Except in "high water," it&#xD;
was rather an out-of-the-way place ("which was all the&#xD;
better for the niggers"), yet near to New Orleans,-free&#xD;
from any overflow to do harm, and inexhaustible in fer-&#xD;
tility of soil.&#xD;
Mildmay listened, and took down the names of the&#xD;
dillerent persons who would naturally be his neighbors;&#xD;
made evary possible inquiry of the facilities of society,-&#xD;
not for himself, for he was in this connection thinking of&#xD;
another, and rode back to the lonely-looking mansion.&#xD;
Here was "the agent," a sort of madcap clerk of New&#xD;
Orleans, who~combined a strange mixture of business tact&#xD;
and knowledge of the world, and particularly of the world&#xD;
in the interior of Louisiana,-with his trunk opened, a table-&#xD;
cloth spreadupon the ground, and a most substantial dinner&#xD;
set out, of boiled ham, chicken, bread,~ sardines, pates, and&#xD;
excellent claret. ~Cumblers and plates he had borrowed&#xD;
from the clerk of the steamer; and all the party, ad~'ter&#xD;
Fenwick and Mildmay's astonishment had been expressed&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
at their agent's foresight, sat down on the ground, and&#xD;
made a hearty meal, and with a better appetite, as Mild-&#xD;
may said, "than he had ever had before in his life."&#xD;
While thus engaged discussing their rural meal, they&#xD;
observed a gentleman approaching on horseback, wh~ rode&#xD;
up, and dismounting and throwing his bridle-rein into the&#xD;
hollow of his left arm, in a graceful and confident manner,&#xD;
announced that his name was Moreton, and that he was&#xD;
the nearest neighbor to Heritage Place; that he had&#xD;
heard from the captain of the steamer as it passed up the&#xD;
bayou, that two gentlemen had stopped for the purpose&#xD;
of examining the place, with regard to making a purchase,&#xD;
and that he had instantly rode over to invite the gentle-&#xD;
men to hi~ house, where he should be happy to have them&#xD;
remain as long as it suited their pleasure.&#xD;
From Mr. Moreton, Mildmay learned additional par-&#xD;
ticulars relative to his proposed purchase, but declined to&#xD;
accept at that time, the invitation to visit, whereupon Mr.&#xD;
Moreton hitched his horse by the bridle to a "swinging&#xD;
limb," and with Mildmay sat down on the trunk of a&#xD;
fallen tree, declaring that he would remain until the&#xD;
steamer came along.&#xD;
In the conversation that ensued, Mildmay determined&#xD;
in his own mind to make the purchase of the plantation.&#xD;
Mr. Moreton had removed every possible objection he could&#xD;
urge, and, with this feeling, he bid that gentleman adieu,&#xD;
was taken up by the passing boat, and the following even-&#xD;
ing was again ensconced in his city hotel.&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
MAJOR DIXON AND HiS ALBUM.&#xD;
&#xD;
MAJOR DIXON; who showed so much ability and dispo-&#xD;
sition to serve Mildmay and his friend Fenwick, was to&#xD;
superficial observers a man of leisure, and of the class&#xD;
termed gentlemen.&#xD;
Persons, however, who studied faoes with success,&#xD;
would have discovered something rather equivocal about&#xD;
hi~ eyes, for by a curious conformation of the brow, they&#xD;
were ordinarily almost hidden from sight; but let Dixon&#xD;
look a person full in the face, and there 'were seen shots of&#xD;
fiery red, mingled with the pure blue, whi~h suggested&#xD;
that they could burn as if filled with internal fire.&#xD;
People who had known Dixon for years, if asked to&#xD;
draw his character, would probably never have agreed&#xD;
upon any leading trait; for he possessed the ability in a&#xD;
remarkable degree of not only being all things to all men&#xD;
for his own purposes, but he could 'be the exact thing to&#xD;
the person lie was at the moment with; and if Mildmay&#xD;
and Fenwick had written down their impressions of this&#xD;
man, they would have both drawn characters as suggested&#xD;
&#xD;
fr:~&#xD;
K&#xD;
&#xD;
by their individual impressions, and that were most agree.&#xD;
able to their positions as strangers in the "Qescent City."&#xD;
Dixon was a man of first-rate business habits and ca-&#xD;
pacity. He controlled large sums of money, for he was&#xD;
secretly connected with many wealthy men, in operations&#xD;
that involved great outlays of capital; his field of opera-&#xD;
tions was confined to dealing in slaves,-in common par-&#xD;
lance, he was a "negro trader." Dixon had been, by long&#xD;
habit, made a very impersonation of his busin~ss. To&#xD;
people of his own color he was often generous,-never&#xD;
offensive; but for the negro he had apparently no sympa-&#xD;
thy, no feeling whatever.&#xD;
Sometimes for months together Dixon would live seem-&#xD;
ingly a quiet and unexcited life, but it would appear from&#xD;
subsequent acts, that these calms were only presages of &amp;amp;&#xD;
coming excitement; and as his business gave him every&#xD;
facility for gratifying his passions when he pleased to do so,&#xD;
he carried every thing to excess.&#xD;
The appearance of a negro always excited Dixon's&#xD;
animosity; let one of this race pass him accidentally in the&#xD;
street, or even in the humblest manner address him "as&#xD;
master," and hi~ eyes would burn with indignation, and&#xD;
his hands clutch with nervous tremulousness.&#xD;
He delighted in crushing those in his power, when they&#xD;
resisted, and yet he was equally savage upon those who&#xD;
were passive to his will. He was sometimes awed by a&#xD;
negro that would rather die thar~ submit, but he was never&#xD;
touched by the most heart-rending appeals for mercy.&#xD;
The reason perhaps of his dislike to the negro, hide-&#xD;
pendent of the feelings necessarily engendered by his&#xD;

THE MiAsTER's HOUsE;*,&#xD;
&#xD;
making them subjects of merchandise, was the conscious-&#xD;
ness he had, that he was not respected even by those who.&#xD;
were most benefited by his business; and he had a kind&#xD;
of monomania, that his degradation in the social scale was&#xD;
owing not only to his buying and selling negroes, but&#xD;
also to the influence of public opinion exerted on the&#xD;
Southern mind by the people of the North, through the&#xD;
sympathy of the Federal government : consequently, he&#xD;
hated the people of the North, and the Union, with a bit-&#xD;
terness that knew no bounds. " But for this public opinion&#xD;
of the ' Free States,'" lie would sometimes groan through&#xD;
his clenched teeth, " my calling would be as respectable&#xD;
as any man's ; I should not then be made a scapegoat for&#xD;
the sins of the. buyer, or be compelled to see myself /&#xD;
shunned and avoided by really good people, as if there&#xD;
were contagion in my touch."&#xD;
Yet, although the thick veil of insensibility would some-&#xD;
times be partially removed from IDixon's conscience, al-&#xD;
though he would for moments get inklings of the true char-&#xD;
acter of his position as set down by the great mass of the&#xD;
people, these feelings only had the effect to render him&#xD;
more callous in the end, for they were ever succeeded by&#xD;
new outrages upon hiis hapless victiins, and by an accumu-&#xD;
lation of renewed hate for the people he so much feared&#xD;
and despised.&#xD;
When Dixon saw Mildinay and Fenwick, he at once un-&#xD;
derstood their relation and purposes, and with his usual&#xD;
promptness he did all he could to assist them in their con-&#xD;
templated purchase, from the ulterior object of their proba-&#xD;
ble demand upon him for, slaves.&#xD;
&#xD;
A TALE OF sOUTHERN LIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
51&#xD;
&#xD;
~&#xD;
&#xD;
He was intimately acquainted with every part of the&#xD;
country, his pursuits favoring a most perfect knowledge of&#xD;
the best lands, and the most wealthy neighborhoods, for it&#xD;
was only in such places, that he found his best business&#xD;
customers.&#xD;
Near to Dixon's hotel was his "depot." Superficially;&#xD;
it was a very high spiked fence, with a strong door in the&#xD;
centre, and would never have attracted any particular notice&#xD;
of the stranger. But once beyond that strong door, you&#xD;
found yourself in a long room, perhaps a hundred feet in&#xD;
depth, lighted from the roof, and lined on either side by&#xD;
benches. Here Dixon displayed what the law pronounced&#xD;
to be his "chattels."&#xD;
In this den he would pace up and down among his&#xD;
dependents, and fume and fret " that he could not expose&#xD;
his merchandise unblushingly in the streets," "that he&#xD;
could not hire a fine store in -the most exposed thorough-&#xD;
fare, and thrust his goods into the-windows or doors, as did&#xD;
the merchant who sold breastpins or calicoes."&#xD;
Here it was that he gave vent to his wrath at the&#xD;
occasional agitation in the Corporation Council of New&#xD;
Orleans "as to the propriety of banishing 'slave marts' to&#xD;
the obscure suburbs of the city." This restraint-this&#xD;
eternal spirit of opposition, he felt to be like an incubus&#xD;
upon him, and he rebelled at, and fretted under it, as if in&#xD;
harness, and he believed that he could never himself be free&#xD;
until " this false northern public sentiment," as he termed&#xD;
it, "was done away, until no one was permitted in the South&#xD;
to indulge in sickly sentimental notions of humanity."&#xD;
A day or two after Dixon met Mildmay, he went to his-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC8057-00000026"/>&#xD;
52               TH~E MAST~R'8 IIOU~E                                                      A' TALE OF B0UTH~RN LIFE.            53&#xD;
&#xD;
"depot," as he termed it., and sitting down in the little&#xD;
office inside of the door, he took a scrap of paper from a&#xD;
plethoric-looking purse, and laying it on the wooden table&#xD;
before him, he seemed absorbed in a profound study.&#xD;
"Graham Mildmay," said he, reading from the paper,&#xD;
"where have I met with that name before?" and he rested&#xD;
his head on his~hand as if in the very strait of perplexity,&#xD;
and wondered where was his factotum "Ben.&#xD;
Just at this moment, a miserable-looking wretch, a&#xD;
white ~nan, who sometimes helped Ben at the depot, put&#xD;
his head in at the office dpor, and said:&#xD;
"Major Dixon, that 'gent' with the black coat and&#xD;
white choker, has sent the girl ]IAzzy back."&#xD;
"What for?" said Dixon, indenting his knuckles into&#xD;
the top of the cypress table.&#xD;
"Why," continued the deputy, scratching his head, "he&#xD;
says he thinks she takes on so about bein' parted from her&#xD;
child, that she won't do."&#xD;
"Send JAzzy here," returned Dixon, now in a perfect&#xD;
fury; and he growled, "if I'm troubled with her after&#xD;
to-morrow, may I turn into a snivelling Yankee peddler,&#xD;
and earn a living by singing psalms."&#xD;
The girl approached the dreaded presence of the negro&#xD;
trader, evidently convulsed in every limb, and almost speech-&#xD;
less with fear.&#xD;
~" low came you to tell that hypocritical chanting scoun-&#xD;
drel I sold' you to, that you had a child?"&#xD;
"I didn't tell him, so help me God !" said the girl, ready&#xD;
to fall on the floor.&#xD;
"You either lie, or you went snivelling about the hou~e,"&#xD;
&#xD;
said Dixon, suddenly changing his maimer, and lighting up&#xD;
his face with a smile.&#xD;
"Ii said nothing, did nothing, but try to please; for I&#xD;
didn't want to come back here, Master Dixon," said the&#xD;
girl with emotion.&#xD;
"Well," returned Dixon, with a calm and agreeable&#xD;
voice, "go out in the hall, my dear, and to-night IL will give&#xD;
you such a dressing, that afterwards, if I sell you to a sau-&#xD;
sage-maker you will cry to be cut up into mince meat before&#xD;
you will come back again on my hands;" and thus deliver-&#xD;
inghimseli~, Dixon waved the girl to retire, and biting off&#xD;
a huge piece of tobacco, he took up the before alluded to&#xD;
bit of paper, and soliloquized,~" Where have I met with&#xD;
the name of Graham Mildmay?"&#xD;
At this moment, a well dressed, and rather pleasant-&#xD;
faced man came into Dixon's presence, and pulling up a&#xD;
chair and throwing his feet 'upon the table, he asked:&#xD;
"Dixon, ~vhat'~s the row?"&#xD;
"Why, the fact is, Ben," said Dixon, as if perplexed~&#xD;
"I have met a young planter at my hotel, that's come out&#xD;
here from North Carolina to buy a place. lle'~ got money,&#xD;
and seems to be a clever and sharp' chap, and I'm thinking&#xD;
I've heard his name beforebut when, where, or how, I can't&#xD;
tell."&#xD;
Now "Ben " was Dixon's confidential clerk, and business&#xD;
man when Dixon was away. Ben. was understood 'by half&#xD;
the town to own the depot. It was Ben who did all the ne-&#xD;
farious work of the establishment, the trading, and, as he said,&#xD;
"the lying and smartness of the wh6l&amp;amp; concern," for Dixon&#xD;
did very little in New Orleans ope~aly, beyond signing title&#xD;

papers and receipting for money. With this intimate con.&#xD;
section with Dixon, it is easy to see that he at once became&#xD;
interested in Mildmay.&#xD;
"What do you want to do for him?" said Ben, refer-&#xD;
ring to Mildmay, and appearing anxious to get the cue.&#xD;
"Why, I want to do him a favor,~~ said Dixon,, frown-&#xD;
ing at the apparent insinuation that any thing else was in.&#xD;
tended. "He's good next spring for twenty hands more&#xD;
than he's got, and I want to show him that I'm his friend,&#xD;
and in that way secure a sale."&#xD;
- "Maybe he's got a runaWay out," said Ben.&#xD;
"That's just it," said Dixon, brightening up," here," he&#xD;
continued, "hand me, down my 'Free Sile Album,' perhaps&#xD;
I can find out all about it)'&#xD;
Ben, as ~requested, got on a chair, and from a wide&#xD;
shelf very near the low ceiling, he pulled out what appear-&#xD;
ed to have been a merchant's ledger, and opening it on the&#xD;
table, displayed the once fairly written pages covered over&#xD;
with innumerable scraps, evidently ci~jt'from the columns of&#xD;
newspapers.&#xD;
This "Free Sile Album," as Dixon called it, was per-&#xD;
haps the best evidence in the world, that could be given,&#xD;
to show how systematic he had been in carrying on his busi-&#xD;
ness. There at a glance could be seen, every published&#xD;
account of runaway negroes, who had escaped to the North&#xD;
or Canada, for the last 1~fteen years.&#xD;
By "the means of this book, Dixon had a very clear&#xD;
idea ,of the whereabouts 'of many fugitives, and with the&#xD;
assistance of spies, and occasionally his own interference,&#xD;
he made unaccounted-for "captures," and ~frequently by&#xD;
4.&#xD;
&#xD;
buying, as he expressed it, "a nigger running," he. got&#xD;
great bargains at little cost.,&#xD;
Ben turned over the pages carefully, and at Dixon's&#xD;
suggestion, endeavored to find, assorted with the runaways&#xD;
mentioned, the name of Milclmay..-IDixon, meanwhile, sit.&#xD;
ting by as if still uncertain, where the name occurred ~&#xD;
finaXly, Ben looked up, and said, "Here's something mast&#xD;
like it."&#xD;
"What, is it?" inquired Dixon.&#xD;
"Why,' 'Mayfield,'" said Ben, decisively.&#xD;
"That's near the name; read what it says," directed&#xD;
Dixon, whereupon Ben commenced as follows&#xD;
"'On last Saturday morning a little 'company, consist-&#xD;
ing of six fugitives from the land of handcuffs and cow-&#xD;
hides, landed at this station of the under-ground railroad.&#xD;
They were formerly kept and worked as the propertyy of&#xD;
the Rev. Mr. Mayfield, near Memphis, in the State of Ten-&#xD;
nessee. On the same day fifteen more came in the express&#xD;
train of the above road. These last were mostly able..&#xD;
bodied men from Missouri, cruelly held and treated as&#xD;
property, by people otherwise respectable, and some claim-&#xD;
ing to be followers of Christ oui~ Saviour, who died. for&#xD;
all.' "&#xD;
"That'll do, Ben," said Dixon, rising up from his&#xD;
seat, and whirling round on his feet, perfectly red with&#xD;
anger-" that'll do; who wants to, hear such infernal&#xD;
stuff as that, I'd like to knQw? That comes from hav-&#xD;
ing 'free~ States,' cuss 'em! Fugatives from the land of&#xD;

"Well, there's no use getting mad about it," said&#xD;
Ben, who had no other fear of Dixon, than self-interest&#xD;
dictated. "M~be you'd like another varse or two; if so,&#xD;
here goes."&#xD;
"No, you needn't," said Dixon, cooling off. "I be-&#xD;
hove I remember the sarcumstance, the nigger was off a&#xD;
long time I suspect, before his' arrival was published; let&#xD;
me see."&#xD;
",Now what is the use of that 'crc book ?" asked Ben,&#xD;
handing it over to Dixon, as if he was glad ~o get clear&#xD;
of it.&#xD;
"N~t much use," returned Dixon, "not much use;&#xD;
but maybe you'd be astonished if I tell you, I made my&#xD;
'Black RiVer cotton farm'~ off of that very book."&#xD;
"Oh,)you're joking," said Ben, with an 'incredulous air.&#xD;
"Fact, nevertheless," said Dixon, looking up with&#xD;
complacency. "You see, Ben, you'll never make money&#xD;
until~ you keep books, Now, since I've been in business&#xD;
for myself, and afore that too, when I saw a notice of a run-&#xD;
away in a newspaper, crowing over his freedom, I cut him&#xD;
out, and pasted him in here; it don't cost much time,&#xD;
nor flour, and it' finally gave~me all the money I made my&#xD;
start with. You see that 'ere' notice," continued Dixon,&#xD;
pointing to a particular scrap, "that 'ere notice marked&#xD;
over with a pen, '$1000. "&#xD;
Ben reached his head out of hi~ coat collar, and said,&#xD;
LL&#xD;

"So much money as that ! '? said Beti, more astonished&#xD;
at the speculation in, a pecuniary way, than at the affecting&#xD;
incidents.&#xD;
"Sure," said Dixon "and no naistake; but that's no-&#xD;
thing," he continued, in an excessive good humor.; "that&#xD;
book, as I said~ has nearly paid for my 'Black River place,'&#xD;
and them very little dirty scra~s,~and the Fugitive Slave&#xD;
Law has put money in my pocket, like finding it in a&#xD;

"Fact?" said Ben, looking over the magical items, as&#xD;
if he fancied he could see them turning to g&amp;amp;ld or bank&#xD;
checks.&#xD;
"Fact!" echoed Dixon; "yes, more than fact, they've&#xD;
been money and fun besides for II have not only,. by the&#xD;
aid of that book, jerked up a dozen. niggers from the free&#xD;
States in a year, but I have made the abolition scoundrels&#xD;

"That must have been fun," said Ben, rather in a&#xD;
voice of irony.&#xD;
"It was fin, fun alive!" continued Dixon, with enthu~~&#xD;
siasm, "for," he continued, in his excitement, "itg~Veme the&#xD;
only satisfaction I ever had in my life out of those enemies&#xD;

finally fell upon the very item he was looking for, he&#xD;
handed the " Album" to Ben, and told him to read it&#xD;
out, Dixon at the same time picking up a piece of pine&#xD;
wood that was lying on the floor, and taking out a long-&#xD;
bladed dirk-knife, commenced to whittle.&#xD;
iflen took the "Album," and with a sort of comical&#xD;

read as follows&#xD;
"~ INT~ILESTING ACCOUNT OF A FUGATIVE2"&#xD;
"~ T1~at's the beginning of the article, isn't it?" asked&#xD;
Di~oii; pressing his knife deeply into the pine splinter in&#xD;
hi8 hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
A TALE OF SOUTHEI~b~ J2FE.&#xD;
"Yes," said Ben, "that's the beginning, dbn't yo~i see&#xD;
it is? 'Interesting account of a fugativ~2"&#xD;
"Well, go on," said Dixon, impatiently.&#xD;
"Look here, Major Dixon," said Ben, puttingthe Al-&#xD;
bum down in his lap,-." do you want me to read the whole&#xD;
of this 'ore interesting article?"&#xD;
"Yes, every bit of it," returned ~Xxon, in the pure&#xD;
spirit of contrariety.&#xD;
"Very well," said Ben, again edging into the best pos-&#xD;
sible position for comfort, "here goes.&#xD;
Interesting account of a fugitive.'"&#xD;
"You needn't read that line again," said Dixon, grow.&#xD;
ing perfectly "feruchus."&#xD;
Ben's eyes twinkled with mischief, but he said nothing,&#xD;
and went on.&#xD;
"'On a cold ~winter night of the year 18.-., a negro&#xD;
man, evidently suffering from hunger; and poorly clad,&#xD;
knocked at the door of a modest-looking cottage on the&#xD;
edge of our town. It was, considering 1~le habits of our&#xD;
people, quite late, being after ten o'clock.'"&#xD;
"And where about was that town?" inquire4 Dixon, his&#xD;
face filled with disgust.&#xD;
"I suspect," said Ben, looking along the page, "that&#xD;
it was Stonyvilip, Vermont, for it's tuck from the Stony.&#xD;
vile (Vermont) Gazette." Ben continued: -&#xD;
"'A benevolent-lo&amp;amp;king, middle-aged woman: opened&#xD;

pointed to the, negro; who now, in turn, became filled with&#xD;
"What's the meaning of 'trepidation?'" inquired&#xD;
Dixon, suspending his whittling.&#xD;
"Kind of a scear," said Ben, with dignity.&#xD;
"'The moment the gentleman saw the object of sur-&#xD;
prise, he stepped. in front of the lady, and promptly de-&#xD;
manded the reason of this unseasonable interruption."'&#xD;
"I'd a hit him in his infernal black face!" said&#xD;
Dixon, with impatience.&#xD;
"Perhaps," said Ben, again laying down the book in&#xD;
his lap (for in his peculiar way he took great pkasure in&#xD;
annoying Dixon), "perhaps you don't want, to hear the&#xD;
rest of. this 'ere nigger novel."&#xD;
"Yes, I do," said Dixon, emphatically, for it was one&#xD;
of his peculiarities of liking to be annoyed by those very&#xD;
kind ofitems. It~appeared to give him pleasure in stimu-&#xD;
lating his hatred of the places and sentiments that gave&#xD;
them birth. Bew went on:&#xD;
"'The negro replied that he was nearly perished with&#xD;
the cold, and was almost starved to death, and after con.&#xD;
siderable cross-questioning, acknowledged that like was a&#xD;
runaway fr~rn the South, which last remark affected deeply&#xD;
the sympathy ~of, Mr. Pendleton, for such was the gentle-&#xD;
mau's name, and he asked the negro into the kitchen, and&#xD;
with~his~a~niable wife, set about relieving the ~Wants of the&#xD;
poor fugitive.'"&#xD;
"There," said Dixon,~ blazing with wrath, and driving&#xD;
&#xD;

~&#xD;
his knife an inch gt Jea~t into the top of the table before ~&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"There's northern rascality; that's for being fastened&#xD;
on to the free $tates. Lord! how 1 wish we could get to&#xD;
blows, I'd like to stop the wind of such a fellow as that&#xD;
Pendleton2'&#xD;
"lEnt there's too many of 'em," said Ben, keeping his&#xD;
eyes deeply riveted on the printed document before him.&#xD;
IDixon ground his knife around with his hand, and told&#xD;
Ben to go on, and that gentleman continued. :~-&#xD;
"'The poor negro was shiveringwith cold, and it seem-&#xD;
ed as if he Would embrace the stove, when he felt the please&#xD;
ant glow of* warmth it sent through his benumbed fr~m~."'&#xD;
"I could have warmed that nigger up, without a stove,"&#xD;
suggested Dixon, in a philosophical manner.&#xD;
Ben pretended to be very much amused indeed, and&#xD;
went on.&#xD;
"'Mr. Pendleton felt satisfied that the negro told the&#xD;
tt~th about having escaped from bondage, and was further&#xD;
confirmed in the fact because the negro, ag~tin~t 1~fr. Pen~&#xD;
dleton's wishes, would address him as Master."'&#xD;
"Now what do you think of that?" inquired DixQn,&#xD;
his face e1oqu~ent with contempt.&#xD;
"Think of what ? ".asked Ben, honestLy at a loss.&#xD;
"Why, of that fellow Pendleton's telling that rigger uot&#xD;
to call him master."&#xD;
"I think," said Ben, imitating Dixon'srnanner and voice,&#xD;
"that Pendleton wa~ a~ chuckle-headed ass ;" and he pro.&#xD;
needed .-&#xD;
'"The negro, when he discovered lJaat Mr. Pendleton&#xD;

02             THE MA5TER~S tboUsE;&#xD;
knew he was from the South, begged that he should not be&#xD;
taken back to his owner, which Mr. PendIeto~ promised, so&#xD;
far as 1~e was concerned,~should not be done."'&#xD;
"Now look at that," said Dixon, perfectly calm with&#xD;
amazement, "look at that Pendleton, disobeying the laws&#xD;
of the land, and violating the sacre~I constitution, by re-&#xD;
fusing to send a negro ba&amp;amp;k to his owner, and calling him-&#xD;
self a Christian, perhaps; for them Yankees all go to&#xD;
chur~,h."&#xD;
"And don't you think he was Christian?" inquired Ben.&#xD;
'~ A~ Christian," replied Dixon, his voice full of scorn,&#xD;
"do yonn think that a thief canbe a Christian? Why, that&#xD;
'ere Pendleton would have been sent to the Penitentiary&#xD;
for keeping a runaway horse worth fifty dollars, and yet he&#xD;
don't mind swindling a southern nian out of a nigger worth&#xD;
a thousand."&#xD;
Now Ben was very slow of comprehension on certain&#xD;
subjects that deeply interested Dixon, and as he never could,&#xD;
probably from the defects of his early education, exactly&#xD;
confound a man and an animal together, he returned to his&#xD;
book and read&#xD;
"'The negro was aceommodatedwith lodgings that night,&#xD;
and the next day, by the kindness of Mr. P. and other citi-&#xD;
~ens, he got employment, and very soon established a c~iar-&#xD;
acter for honesty and industry.&#xD;
"It would be interesting, if we had time, to trace the&#xD;
historyof this fugitive slave year after year in his north-&#xD;

ence, it was found he had naturally ~ strong apd well-bal-&#xD;
anced mind, and unlike most of his race, he was frugal, and&#xD;
took pleasure in saving money.&#xD;
"By the advice of Mr Pendleton~ he hired a small&#xD;
house, and opened a little store, for the disposal of such&#xD;
nicknacks'as he was able to procure, and finally he started&#xD;
what was much needed in Stoneyville, a barber'~ shop. In&#xD;
this new character, Charles, for such was his name, really&#xD;
had the head-quarters of news under lock and key, and his&#xD;
shop kept so neat and clean in summer, and so warm and&#xD;
snug in winter, was a favorite with all, while every one ad-&#xD;
mitted that the negro was a model of good manners, and&#xD;
respectful bearing.'&#xD;
"Well, he got his manners in the South," said Dixon,&#xD;
putting an enormous piece of tobacco in his mouth.&#xD;
"'At the close of the third year of his living in ~toney-&#xD;
ville," continued Ben, without noticing Diion's interrup.~&#xD;
tion, "Charles met a well-behaved yonng woman of his own&#xD;
color and unmarried, and as he had established a good char-&#xD;
acter in the mean time as a member of the church, he was&#xD;
married by the resident pastor, being previously baptized&#xD;
by his request, with the surname of Broadnax."'&#xD;
"A.nd- what does all that mean?" inquired Dixon, get-&#xD;
ting confused with the details.&#xD;
~' Why," said Ben, "he was married a~ Charles Bioad-&#xD;
nax."&#xD;
"'At last,' continued Ben to read, 'the old sexton of&#xD;
the "first church" in Stoneyville died, and Charles was&#xD;
unanimously elected to the office of taking cave of the sacred&#xD;

"Look here," said Ben, putting the book down in his&#xD;
lap, and taking a long breath, "Major, if you don't put in&#xD;
a word as I go along, I shan't x~ead."&#xD;
"And haven't you finished ?" said Dixon, leaning over to-&#xD;
Wards Ben, his eyes wide open with interests&#xD;
"NO, there's another short item."&#xD;
well, read it," said Dixon earnestly, "for you haven't&#xD;
tome to the part I want to hear."&#xD;
tWA           "Well~ here goes," said Ben, resuming the narrative.&#xD;
"'We have published this very interesting account of&#xD;
Charles Broadnax, as a refutation of ~the common charge&#xD;
that negroes cax~not become useful citizens. This man, this&#xD;
Christian, admits that until his old master, William Mild-&#xD;
may, died, a gentleman Charles speaks of in the highest&#xD;
respect, that he was happy and contented; but that, put un-&#xD;
der the cJiarge~ of a brutal and irresponsible oversees'; lie&#xD;
was compelled to escape."'&#xD;
By the time Ben got thus far, Dixon started from his&#xD;
seat, and dancing around the table, somethkg as Indians&#xD;
do about a bloody scalp, he told Ben he needn't read any&#xD;
farther, that he had found out all that. he Wanted to kiiow,&#xD;
and that he could put the precious book out of sight.&#xD;
Ben) who wa~ really fatigued, readily obeyed, and turn..&#xD;

"So, you think Charles Broadnax, esquire, belongs to&#xD;
the young man Mildmay, at the hotel?" -&#xD;
Dixon leaned down on the table, made a few hiero~.&#xD;

&#xD;
A TALE OF SOUTHERN LIFE.&#xD;
his head, and giving Ben a knowing look, he left "the&#xD;
depot," and walked rapidly up the street.&#xD;
As Dixon had anticipated when he left his "pen," he&#xD;
found Mildmay in the rotunda of the hotel, quietly smoking&#xD;
a cigar, and walking up and saluting him, as was h~s cus-&#xD;
tom when talking to planters, he took a seat at a respectful&#xD;
distance, and commenced conversation.&#xD;
Dixon artfully approached his object, and led the un-&#xD;
suspecting Mildmay on from one point to another so iix~&#xD;
geniously, that he unfolded his business of slave-dealer&#xD;
without exciting in his hearer any particular emotion.&#xD;
This once accomplished, the advantages of the purchase&#xD;
of "Heritage~ Place" were discussed, and Mildmay finally&#xD;
learned with surprise, that Dixon himself had a plantation&#xD;
in the neighborhood, and that he, Dixon, contemplated in&#xD;
another year, "that he might possibly give ~ip 'any ~tive&#xD;
participation in 'his negro-trading business,' and settle&#xD;
down quietly on Lie farm."&#xD;
From Dixon, Mildmay learned the best way of getting&#xD;
his slaves on to Louisiana; it was decided that he should&#xD;
bring them on to Washington, in the District of Columbia,&#xD;
and there keep them until a vessel sailed directly to~~e~&#xD;
Orleans, from which point, they could without difficulty&#xD;
reach their final place of destination, At length, Dixon&#xD;
reached the subject for the moment nearest his heart.&#xD;
"I think," said he. in a careless voice, and apparently&#xD;
about to leave, "that you have, Mr. Mildmay, a runaway&#xD;
somewhere in the East."&#xD;
"Not that I know of," said the young man, without dish.&#xD;
playing any interest.&#xD;

"I tEink I have heard somewhere," continued Dixon,&#xD;
~5' of a negro boy, called Charles, that belonged to a person&#xD;
of yow name, that runaway is probably at this time&#xD;
suffering, ~s all them runaways do, from hunger and cold.&#xD;
I tell yow, sir," said Dixon, "a negro has a hard time of it&#xD;
at the North in winter; ." and he assumedd a sympathizing&#xD;
look.&#xD;
* "A negro certainly thrives best in a warm climate,"&#xD;
said Mildmay; evidently to IDixon's annoyance, not think-&#xD;
ing of the runaway.&#xD;
"Here's the facts," said Dixon, taking out a scrap of&#xD;
paper from his pocket; "a negro boy, named Charles,&#xD;
some years ago escaped from Washington, ~nd is now liv-&#xD;
Ing in the North; he says he belonged to William~Mild-&#xD;
nia~y,'Z~-and Dixon gave~ the best emphasis that he was&#xD;
eap~b1e of to the name.&#xD;
Graham started with surprise; "William Mildmay,"&#xD;
said he, with emotion, "was my ~ name-what is it&#xD;
that you connect it with?"&#xD;
"Simply," said Dixon, with great coolness, "that he&#xD;
was unfortunate in being robbed by them infernal North-&#xD;
eners, of a good iiigger."&#xD;
"~The accident of having a runaway, sir," said 'Mild-&#xD;
may, with considerable sternness, "is a~ resi~ilt of a thou-&#xD;
sand causes which I care not to discuss. Now I remem-&#xD;
ber it, I have noticed upon the old plantation record, that&#xD;
a; boy is set down as having run away while hired out' but&#xD;
it was many years ago, and I have never heard it other-&#xD;
wise alluded to before."&#xD;
"Wouldn't you like to get him back?" said Dizon,&#xD;
&#xD;
pretending to choke at the instant, to keep Mildmay from&#xD;
seeing the expression of his face.&#xD;
"I can't say that I would," replied Mildmay, relapsing&#xD;
into an indifferent mood. "You know, Major Dixon,&#xD;
that it is a proverb among planters, 'that a recaptured&#xD;
runaway is unfit to associate with ~ I don't remem~&#xD;
ber of ever hearing of one that the owner~would have&#xD;
back as a gift?'&#xD;
"But suppose, sir, that the boy was discontented,&#xD;
suppose he knew that you had taken possession of your&#xD;
property, and wanted to come back; what would you do&#xD;
then?"&#xD;
"If such were the fact," said Mildmay speculatively,&#xD;
"why perhaps he might be a good servant,-especially as&#xD;
he did not run off until my father died."&#xD;
" Exactly," said JMxon, "that's just it; but wh~u lie&#xD;
knows that he could come home, and live with you, why,&#xD;
wouldn't it be cruel no~ to let him?"&#xD;
"I might," returned Mildmay7 "then make a sacrifice&#xD;
of my judgment, and receive him; but such improbable&#xD;
circumstances I think never will occur.&#xD;
"Would you \be willing~ that I sl~ouId bring him to&#xD;
you, if I should meet him?" pursued Dixon, pressing the&#xD;
matter with increasing earnestness.&#xD;
"You can do as you please, sir," said Mildniay; then&#xD;
hesitating a moment, he continued, "If I found. the boy&#xD;
troublesome or discontented, I could certainly let him go&#xD;
again."&#xD;
"Certainly you can," said Dixon; and making this&#xD;
re~nark, he bowed gracefully, and returned to his depot.&#xD;

THE MASTER'S HOUSE;&#xD;
&#xD;
Mildmay, who had received much valuable business in-&#xD;
formation from Dixon, relative to his future plans, had&#xD;
continued the conversation about Charles out of respect to&#xD;
Dixon'~ seemingly earnest desire to talk, and not from&#xD;
any interest or real knowledge of what was the con-&#xD;
strued import of Lis language; yet when. Dixon and Mild-&#xD;
may separated, the negro trader assumed that he had&#xD;
Mildmay's authority to arrest Charles, if he could find&#xD;
him,~ and bring him on to iloritage Place, while Mildmay&#xD;
himself could not have conceived any thing farther from&#xD;
his thoughts.&#xD;
A few days only elapsed before Mildmay, much to&#xD;
F~nwick's satisfaction, had completed the proposed pur-&#xD;
chase. By a train of fortunate circumstances, he believed&#xD;
he had secured a great bargain, which opinion was con-&#xD;
firmed by subsequent examination. The arrangements&#xD;
having been fully completed, Fenwick was desirous of hur-&#xD;
rying away; and finding Mildmay disposed to carry out&#xD;
his desire to visit the surrounding country, he took from&#xD;
his employer some general directions, and rapidly pursued&#xD;
his way to his old home, to make preparations for the con-&#xD;
templated removal to Heritage Place.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
A VARIETY OF INCIDENTS.&#xD;
THE difficulties attending the removal of Mildmay's "force"&#xD;
from the "o1~d homestead," seemed to him at times to be.&#xD;
almost insurmountable. His original intention was to&#xD;
send the stoutest of his men under the care of Fenwick to&#xD;
Richmond, and then send them by sea to New Qrleans; 1~ut&#xD;
the negroes expressed the utmost horror at being separated,&#xD;
and as he found it impossible to make them understand that&#xD;
they were all to meet again in Louisiana, he determined&#xD;
at whatever cost and trouble it might be, to keep them&#xD;
all together, and personally superintend their exodus.&#xD;
For several days the negroes were busy getting to~&#xD;
gather "their plunder," and it was with some reluctance&#xD;
that they abandoned their rude tables, broken chairs, and&#xD;
clumsy hen-coops, when informed that they were too cum-&#xD;
brous for exportation; and nothing, perhaps, would have&#xD;
reconciled them to their loss, had they not discovered that&#xD;
their master set them the example, by discarding ~every&#xD;
thing not positively necessary for the long journey before&#xD;

bu~ for the fact that the vicinity; was hallowed by the&#xD;

kicked Governor's bench from under him, both coming to-&#xD;

still indignant Governor, at the same time maliciously imi-&#xD;
tatingwzenasai twang of Tom's voice.&#xD;
'KNot a pine knot!" sighed the negroes in diorus;&#xD;
"Oh Lord ! "they ejaculated~ as the fearful truth broke in&#xD;
upon them, "what shall we do widout pine knots ?" and&#xD;
the meeting broke up; the first really serious objection&#xD;
against removing to Louisiana, having impressed itself&#xD;
upon their minds.&#xD;
At the proposed time for starting, five large wagons&#xD;
were filled with camp equipage, cooking utensils, sick or&#xD;
delicate women, and infant children. It was near noon&#xD;
when the long procession of wheeled vehicles and footmen,&#xD;
started from the old house, and gradually falling into line,&#xD;
commenced winding their toilsome way along the road.&#xD;
By nightfall, the "emigrants" had passed beyond&#xD;
the familiar "vicinity" of their deserted home. A place&#xD;
was selected for the ~~encampment,~~ and all was cheerful&#xD;
bustle. The negroes went merrily t~ work to cook their&#xD;
suppers, the fires blazed brightly in the open air, and sweet&#xD;
sleep, long ere midnight, rested upon the eyes of all, save&#xD;
those of the "young master."&#xD;
From day to day the train pursuedits onwar&amp;amp; but slow&#xD;
progress. The care and responsibility that rested upon&#xD;
Mildmay, hourly changed the giddy thoughts of youth&#xD;
into the solemn reflections of sobered maturity. As he&#xD;
rode ahead of his "helpless family," he could not, help&#xD;
contrasting his position and duties with the lighter expe-&#xD;
rience of his college days; and there were times when sor-&#xD;
row and vexation came upon him, and then be envied those&#xD;
&#xD;
whose birth had relieved them of the heavy resp~nsibi1i~&#xD;
ties that had been by Providence placed upon I4~.&#xD;
If the negroes became dispirited, he encouraged them;&#xD;
if they were sick, he acted both as nurse and physician.&#xD;
If the wagons broke, he it was that personally supe~rin-&#xD;
tended their repair. In truth, Mildmay alone was the&#xD;
thinking, responsible soul of the throng.&#xD;
Week after week passed on, and Mildmay found him-&#xD;
self approaching the end of the most laborious part of his&#xD;
tedious journey. He had left the mighty pine forests of&#xD;
North Carolina behind him, which, desolate as they seem,&#xD;
contain untold wealth, as the reward of well-directed in-&#xD;
dustry, and was descending into the romantic valley of.&#xD;
the Cun~berland, in the State of Tennessee.&#xD;
The change of vegetation and dimate was perceptible.&#xD;
As the rich lands were met with, population increased, and&#xD;
the refinements of life followed in the train of wealth. The&#xD;
independent planters along the highways, often compelled&#xD;
Mildmay to be their guest, and assisted him in the tern-&#xD;
p~rary disposition of his negroes. Wherever he appeared&#xD;
he commanded respect, and often did the generous-hearted&#xD;
Tennesseans congratulate their sister State of Louisiana,&#xD;
upon the acquisition of such a noble and intelligent young&#xD;
man as one of her citizens.&#xD;
As Graham neared the noble tributary of the Ohio, he&#xD;
became involved with innumerable~ bodies of emigrants,~of&#xD;
every condition of life, who were, like himself, struggling&#xD;
on toward a new home.&#xD;
The imagination cannot paint the scenes of misery and&#xD;
distress, and yet of hope, portrayed by the different fami-&#xD;

lies as they moved along. Here were to be seen white m~.:,&#xD;
as ignorant as their negroes, pursuing their way with the&#xD;
dogged Airrnness of American energy, carrying from habit&#xD;
their rifles on their shoulder; and~ followed by their wives,&#xD;
whoso superior refinement and sensible ambition, mkde fa-&#xD;
vorable contrasts with the sterner sex,&#xD;
It would have afforded a curious example of Southern&#xD;
life, to the people of Malden, could they have seen their&#xD;
favorite student, their eloquent valedictorian, their refined&#xD;
and carefully arrayed Qinaham Mildmay; ride along their&#xD;
elm-embowered streets, as he now appeared at the approach-&#xD;
ing termination of this arduous journey to his prospective&#xD;
home.&#xD;
if is overcoat, which he constantly wore, was soiled;&#xD;
and hi~ hat, originally broadbrimmed, to protect his face&#xD;
from the sun and rain, had wilted up under their com-&#xD;
bined influences, and flapped rowdily over his face; ibis&#xD;
thick, strong boots, were of a dingy yellow color, and&#xD;
half concealed by the heavy straps that fastened on hi~&#xD;
spurs. Around his waist was a belt, that relieved him&#xD;
from some fatigue while riding, and at nightfall, while&#xD;
he wat4ihed by the camp fire, held the protecting pistol.&#xD;
Would Annie Hastings have discerned her ideal,&#xD;
through that rough exterior? The admiring friends of&#xD;
Maiden would not; yet we think, that the microscopic eye&#xD;
of affection would have seen; in the ease of attitude,..-in&#xD;
the centaur attachment to the noble horse,-in the firm&#xD;
impress of the foot, though scarcely touching the stirrup,-..-&#xD;
in the sovereign carriage of the he&amp;amp;d,-4n the self-reliance&#xD;
of the eye,-that such was indeed Graham, and that his&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;

&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
real merits shone forth sublime, although undocked by&#xD;
fashion's art.&#xD;
Graham, after nearly two long, weary months, had the&#xD;
pleasure of seeing, while at his night watch, the puffing&#xD;
steam from a boat, that was gliding up the long-wished&#xD;
or Oumberland. The sight filled him with pleasure; the&#xD;
disagreeable part of his journey was at an end.&#xD;
On the following morning, Fenwick, who had been dis-&#xD;
patched ahead, some two or three days in advance, met&#xD;
Nildmay, as had been appointed, at his present encamp-&#xD;
ment, and gave him the pleasant information, that on the&#xD;
second day following the flue steamer, "Great West,"&#xD;
would be at "Ford's .lat~ding."&#xD;
'" This is more fortunate than I could have expected,"&#xD;
said Mildmay..&#xD;
"Great luck," said the i~perturbahle Fenwick; "only&#xD;
big boat in the river~ last one too, for they say the water is&#xD;
going down, and they'll have to come to stain wheelers;"&#xD;
and the faithful Fenwick seemed almost exhausted with his&#xD;
volubility.&#xD;
"How far ~re we from the ford~ Fenwiek?" asked Mild-&#xD;
may with impatient interest.&#xD;
"Not more than a day's journey, if we push up a little,"&#xD;
and having said this, Fenwick, who had been awayfor three&#xD;
days, without farther parley rode among the negroes,&#xD;
who were lazily, doggedly preparing for the accustomed&#xD;
start, and after bustling around, scolding, coaxing and order-&#xD;
ing, informed them of the fact, that at night their foot&#xD;
travels would be at an end; which fact had a marvellous&#xD;
effect, not only upon the negroes, but apparently upon the&#xD;

was again heard the sounds of light-hearted laughter, and&#xD;
Jack in stentorian voice struck up ~n extemporaneous re-&#xD;
frain, with a tremendous chorus of-&#xD;
"Master's going down de rubber,&#xD;

Oh, he's de man wid a hundred niggers,&#xD;
High 0, high 0,&#xD;
Walk along steamboat, what yon waiting for-?&#xD;
Whew-yaw, yaw, yaw.'~&#xD;
In the course of the ensuing morning, Graham over-&#xD;
took an old wagon drawn by two skeleton oxen. ZBefore&#xD;
the animals walked a sallow-faced man, with hair as stiff and&#xD;
colorless as hay. In the vehicle could be distinguished, in&#xD;
spite of the hoop-stretched cotton top, a poor woman, that&#xD;
seemed to be suffering intensely with the repeated attacks&#xD;
of the ague.&#xD;
"Where are you from, stranger?" asked Graham, riding&#xD;
beside the man, and adopting, insensibly to himself, the&#xD;
language of the road.&#xD;
"From old North Caroline," said the man doggedly,&#xD;
without looking up.&#xD;
"And where are you going?" continued Graham, with&#xD;
some curiosity.&#xD;
"I'm swine to old Alabam," was the reply, whined&#xD;
out.&#xD;
"]3y land all the way?" said Graham, feeling in his&#xD;
pocket.&#xD;
"All the way, except I go to Notchee on the Massis-&#xD;
sip.&#xD;
&#xD;
"How came you to leave the old North State?" pursued&#xD;
Graham, willing~to be interested in any passing event.&#xD;
"Why you see," said the animated automaton, tipping&#xD;
his poor oxen on the head with his whip, "Why you see,&#xD;
the turpentine and cutting log business stopped on the Pc-&#xD;
dee, and the mast crap failed, so the stock died and, I&#xD;
thought I'd go to Alabam, and commence again.&#xD;
"And why do you go to Alabama, my friend," suggest-&#xD;
ed Graham delicately, "when;" he continued, "you pass&#xD;
so much good land upon your route?"&#xD;
"Why you see, I want to get into a healthy region, said&#xD;
the man, glancing at his wife.&#xD;
"Why, are there no healthy places save in Alabama?"&#xD;
queried Mildmay, now decidedly interested.&#xD;
"No pine lands elsewhar, as I knows on," said the man,&#xD;
an air of intelligence for the first time brightening up his&#xD;
vacant face.&#xD;
"You have a long way before you," said Graham in&#xD;
real sympathy; "and perhaps you will allow inc to loaxiyou&#xD;
a trifle, as I'm a North Carolinian myself;" and Graham&#xD;
held towards the man a few silver dollars.&#xD;
"Not a cent," said the man resolutely, but casting his&#xD;
eyes behind him, and meeting the gaze of his wife he said:&#xD;
"Perhaps the ~ld woman will have 'em. She wants some&#xD;
store medicine; "and with this remark he resumed his place&#xD;
beside his cattle, as if fatigued by conversation.&#xD;
Graham added to the amount he had proposed to give&#xD;
to the man, placed the coins in the cold attenuated hand&#xD;
of the poor emigrant's wife, and received a smile in return,&#xD;

* that he credited to Annie Hastings, and then with a light&#xD;
heart galloped on after "his people."&#xD;
It was ten o'clock at night before Mildmay reached" the&#xD;
ford." It appeared as if his cattle and his negroes had&#xD;
* just strength to. accomplish the journey, for they now all&#xD;
appeared to be absolutely broken down; the task completed,&#xD;
the spirit of the man no longer sustained his infirmities.&#xD;
Very little p~dns was taken to arrange for the night&#xD;
the horses were unharnessed where they stopped in the road,&#xD;
and after being carelessly fed, the negroe's sat down, too fa-&#xD;
tigued and too happy to think of eating, and in most cases,&#xD;
while gazing into the clear blue water of the shining river,&#xD;
fell asleep.&#xD;
Graham with his own hands, assisted Fenwick in&#xD;
making up a fire to protect his dependents from the night&#xD;
air, and with a solemn joy he sat down and thanked Heaven&#xD;
that t~he most dreaded task of his life had been so happily&#xD;
accomplished.&#xD;
Graham's journey down the Oumberland was character-&#xD;
ized by no startling incident. He was exceedingly fortu-&#xD;
nate in procuring a, boat larg&amp;amp; enough to take his slaves,&#xD;
wagons and other Property without difficulty on board. He&#xD;
superintended the erection of temporary benches'behind&#xD;
the engines as sleeping places for his negroes, provided&#xD;
them with a large stove for cooking their victuals, and made&#xD;
them, 'under the circumstances, very happy indeed.&#xD;
For himself he selected a comfortable state-room in&#xD;
th~ cabin, which he occupied most of the day, in resting&#xD;
from the fatigues he had gone through with, in reading, and&#xD;
what to him was of the greatest pleasurable importance,&#xD;
&#xD;
in sketching an epitome of his "Wanderings through the&#xD;
Wilderness," which was carefully sealed, and at on~ of the&#xD;
way post~offlces along the~ river, wh9n. the steamer stopped&#xD;
to procure wood, provisions or passengers,. was mailed to&#xD;
Miss Annie Hastings, Maiden.&#xD;
Fenwick had a comfortable bed prepared among the&#xD;
negroes, and. at, night, at stated. times, Mildmay took&#xD;
his w~ttch while Fenwick slept, to preserve them from&#xD;
evil communications; from being enticed away; and for&#xD;
their general protection.&#xD;
Night after night, when Oraham's dependents were&#xD;
wrapped in oblivious, care-dissipating sleep, would he pac.e&#xD;
for long and solitary hours; a sentinel, who, not only guard..;&#xD;
ed and defended, but had to think, act and provide for those&#xD;
who were placed in his charge. The sickening mists of the&#xD;
river would roll over his person, while he was at his p9st,.&#xD;
the profane and reckless conversation of the deck hands&#xD;
would salute his ear-all was rough, ungeriial, barbarous.&#xD;
Once upon his new ~plantation, he soon became interest~&#xD;
ed in the establishment of his force in their quarters, and in&#xD;
providing his overseer with a house. There were mechan-&#xD;
ics to employ, agricultural implements to be obtained, money&#xD;
to be procured, and a thousand annoyances he could not ~J&#xD;
anticipate, favorable as were his circumstances, eomp~red&#xD;
with thousands who seek a new hcune in the Southwest.&#xD;
Mr. Moreton occasionally rode over to see Graham, and&#xD;
~issisted him by many useful suggestions; bu~ to return&#xD;
these visits, Graham never went abroad except on business.&#xD;
The summer and winter passed away, and spring came.&#xD;
The crop was in the ground, the prospect of the future was&#xD;
&#xD;
'18&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC8057-00000041"/>&#xD;
bright, and as the necessity of exertion ceased, so did Gra-&#xD;
ham relax from his cares; and begin to think of some re-&#xD;
pose as a reward, for his unceasing industry.&#xD;
It was now that his affection for Annie increased. He&#xD;
now had a home to invite her to, he longed for her society,&#xD;
he wished to hear her merry laugh ring through his house,&#xD;
and see her grace his now solitary table. Fenwick was&#xD;
competent and trustworthy, and, sooner than he intended,&#xD;
Graham made his preparations to visit the North.&#xD;
Judging from Annie's letters (for within the last year&#xD;
Graham and Annie had directly corresponded with each&#xD;
other), a responsive chord had been touched in her bosom.&#xD;
The cold calm reserve of her first epistles, had given way&#xD;
to a tone of unrestrained confidence.&#xD;
It was these letters that gilded all of Graham's cares.&#xD;
In the solitary musings of his journey through the "Old&#xD;
North State," in hi~ repose by the side of his ~camp fire&#xD;
among the rich lands and hospitable people of Tennessee,&#xD;
at his midnight watch on the Mississippi, or hisf~olitary&#xD;
hours at Heritage Place, Annie's letters had been his great-&#xD;
est solace, and he exulted that he had awakened an iz~terest&#xD;
in her heart, and that she was the chosen companion of his&#xD;
life.&#xD;
Every thing with Graham had gone well. The young~&#xD;
planterfelt just pride as he rode over his broad acres, and&#xD;
witnessed the improvements of llerita~e P1ac~. The neg-&#xD;
lected Qut.buildings were now neat and eomfo#table, the&#xD;
dilapidated fences were all repaired; and there were eviden-&#xD;
cesof a c~o~ning reward for agricultural laborpur~ued under&#xD;
his own observant eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
80&#xD;
&#xD;
Graham, in fact, seemed destined to great worldly pros-&#xD;
perity. O~i the same day he received a letter from North&#xD;
Carolina announcing his probable hoirship to a handsome&#xD;
estate, left by a distant relative of whose existence he had&#xD;
never before heard, and one from his commission merchant&#xD;
in New Orleans, offering him a large advance on the origi-&#xD;
nal amount he gtwe for Heritage Place&#xD;
Nearly two years had passed since he left MaIden.&#xD;
Now relieved of the pressure of business egres, he deter-&#xD;
mined, even sooner than he had intended, to visit the North.&#xD;
His arrangements were soon made, and leaving every thing&#xD;
in charge of Fenwick, he set out upon his long anticipated&#xD;
trip. Graham once upon his journey, was l~iimself sur-&#xD;
prised at his~ own impatience. Night and day he had but&#xD;
one idea, and that was, to speed oii his way.&#xD;
Arriving at Malden he at once proceeded to his hotel.&#xD;
As he rattled along its streets, he recognized the familiar  4&#xD;
buildings as they appeared to dance when looked at through&#xD;
the windows of the coach, and recognized the happy faces&#xD;
of many merchants and, citizens witliwhom he was familiar.&#xD;
There were students too, standing about in groups, whose&#xD;
listless gait and abstracted airs brought old time feelings&#xD;
to his heart. The coach~ rattled on. The familiar house&#xD;
of Dr. Elliott, rising against the sky from its commanding&#xD;
position, seemed to float by him as if whirling in a circle&#xD;
of whieli he was the centre-anon there came familiar trees&#xD;
and shady walks, then rushed by him the old Hastings&#xD;
House, the window panes glistening like crystal, all quiet,&#xD;
all repose, and he aank~back upon his ~shioned seat almost&#xD;
suffocated with the swellings and throbbings of his heart.&#xD;

&#xD;
Another instant and the vehicle stopped. Its door wa~&#xD;
opened, and Mildmay jumped out upon the pavement.&#xD;
"Mildmay," "Graham,'.' shouted a dozen voices at once,&#xD;
and he wa# overwhelmed with gratulations.&#xD;
His fellow students, who had, a~ freshmen, ~~heard his&#xD;
eloquent ~aledietory, but now growvinto solemn juniors,&#xD;
fairly hugged him round the neek~ while the honest old&#xD;
IandlorA of the "Hotel" stood by, and when he'~could get.&#xD;
an opportunity helped Graham up the steps as if he were&#xD;
his own long lost but now returned son.&#xD;
It was the idle hour of the day at Maiden, an4 the&#xD;
news spread from mouth to mouth, and ran along thestreets&#xD;
with telegraphic quickness, that "Gr~ha~m. Mildn~ay~;had&#xD;
come!"&#xD;
There was an absolute sensation of pleasure that beat&#xD;
like a pulse among all the people, so much was Graham be-&#xD;
loved. Dr. Elliott caught the~ news, as he was working in&#xD;
his flower~.garden, and by' twilight trimming into shape a&#xD;
honeysuckle vine, and the good old man, just where he was,&#xD;
fell upon his knees and returned thanks to Heaven, that he&#xD;
was to see his " beloved child again."&#xD;
Annie the while was in her own r~m, looking over&#xD;
Graham's last letter. "He will certainly liei'e~'the day af-&#xD;
ter to.rnorrow,'if he is not mistaken in the time he surely&#xD;
would not delay on the way," she reflected, 'as the blood&#xD;
mantled to her cheeks, and While thus engaged at her own&#xD;
speculations and communing with her own thoughts, a.&#xD;
favorite but statelT old female serv&amp;amp;~t of the Hastings&#xD;
family stole up to Armie's room and ge~itly pushed at the&#xD;
doer, but finding it locked she stopped and said':&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mistress Annie, he's come."&#xD;
"Where?" said Annie, looking around vaguely.&#xD;
"Not here yet, but *at the 'hotel," replied the 'solemn&#xD;
old servant, walking away.&#xD;
Annie sat ~a monie~it like one entranced. Her delicate&#xD;
face grew red and i~le; and then crushing Graham's letter&#xD;
to her face she found relief in deep, scalding, gushiug'te'M's.&#xD;
As soon as Graham could do so, 'he slipped away from&#xD;
his friends, and his first act was to write and dispatch a n&amp;amp;te&#xD;
to the old Hastings House, and half an hour afterward~ he&#xD;
was rapidly threading the familiar streets of Maiden.&#xD;
Annie, pale with excitement' sat in the old parlor, buried&#xD;
in an arm-chair, with a book upside down in her hand, yet&#xD;
one would suppose, from her intent gaze upon it, that she&#xD;
was busy reading. The time since Graham had last seen&#xD;
her had wrought many changes in, her appearance. 'She&#xD;
was now in the full perfection of maidenly beauty~ She&#xD;
was, too, somewhat grown in height, her form was full and&#xD;
round, and' there was a thoughtful, responsible expression&#xD;
about her eye, making it far mo~~e beautiful than in the&#xD;
times that were past.&#xD;
The grim old puritan female servant of the Hastings&#xD;
family, had lived for years, it might almost be said for a&#xD;
century, in the house, and had never in all. that~time shown&#xD;
any more sentiment or geniality than would a pillar of ice.&#xD;
She had known Annie from her infancy, and yet had in all&#xD;
that time coldly and respec~tfulIy done her duty toward tie"&#xD;
young lady, frowning down any thanks oi~ professions of love&#xD;
as if they were mortal sins. But now she was roused. It&#xD;
would seem that she had watched the love passages between&#xD;

&#xD;
Graham, once on his wayi South, became anxious to reach&#xD;
his journey's end, and by such progress as was not fatiguing&#xD;
to Annie, he' was soon upon the Ohio, and rapidly descend-&#xD;
ing the Mississippi.&#xD;
The rivers were low, and the best class of. accommuoda-&#xD;
tions were 119t to be had, but to Annie, this very want of&#xD;
faciJitie~ proved a source of constant amusement.&#xD;
Heritage Place, as has been described, was off the river&#xD;
some twenty miles, and approached by a bayou, which in&#xD;
the spring of the year was navigable. When Graham&#xD;
landed at the point on the river nearest his plantation,&#xD;
he found that he would have to make the rest of the jour-&#xD;
ney by land, or in a skiff, as the bayou was now almost&#xD;
dried up.&#xD;
There were no families residing near "the lauding," and&#xD;
no places of accomn~odation that could afford a comfortable&#xD;
shelter for the night; and this unexpected difficulty gave&#xD;
Graham a great deal of annoyance. As the steamer on&#xD;
which they had lived so pleasantly for many days disap-&#xD;
peared, it seemed to Annie that she an~d Mildmay had been&#xD;
abandoned in the forests.&#xD;
Two negroes who were employed in chopping wood near&#xD;
by, came forward, and instantly recognized "Master ~Mi1d-&#xD;
may," and by their assistance Gi'aham' got his trunks up&#xD;
the steep bank,.. and deposited them and Annie murder the&#xD;
shade of a wide-spreading tree.' The niegroes then ran off&#xD;
and ~aid they would return with their master.&#xD;
"This is rather' rough, Annie," said Graham, looking&#xD;
around, "but it is very rarely that persons find themselves&#xD;
in our strait. If Fenwick could have anticipated our arri~'&#xD;
&#xD;
86&#xD;
&#xD;
81&#xD;
&#xD;
val," he continued, "the carriage would have been in&#xD;
waiting."&#xD;
"It's only twenty miles you say, Graham, and then we&#xD;
are home," suggested Annie.&#xD;
"Only twenty."&#xD;
"Then let us go at once," said the young wife, ~' for I&#xD;
verily believe I could walk all' the way."&#xD;
"You are a brave girl," said ~Mildmay, laughing, "but&#xD;
we will do better than that; see, here 'comes some one who&#xD;
will assist us," and Graham looked towards the proprietor&#xD;
of one of the log cabins in the neighbQrhood.&#xD;
A rough-looking man came up, and instantly recog-&#xD;
nized Graham, and shook him cordially by the hand. He&#xD;
said, among other things, that he had been "'4own the&#xD;
bayou," a few days before; had seen Fenwick; that every&#xD;
"thing looked 'well, and promised a fine crop, and also, that&#xD;
Fenwick did not expect Mildmay for a week,&#xD;
This gossip was exceedingly gratifying to Mildmay,&#xD;
and it was soon arranged, that he would go home in a&#xD;
skiff," as there was water enough for that purpose. The&#xD;
baggage was removed to the light boat,'thc two negroes&#xD;
took their places as oarsmen, and Graham hl3lped Annie&#xD;
into the stern, and took his place beside her.. In the&#xD;
course of two hours th~y were' sailing merrily along, soon&#xD;
coniparatively to be at the end of the journey.&#xD;
As the skiff proceeded, Graham explained to Annie&#xD;
how it was, that in "high water," the dark muddy sluice.&#xD;
way through which they were then travelling wo~ild con-&#xD;
tain a flood, in which the largest ships could navigate; aaid&#xD;

&#xD;
i.~y other descriptions of scenery, and pleasant incidents, he&#xD;
beguiled the time.&#xD;
Gradually the sun settled down in the west, and the&#xD;
';~ deep, dark shadows of the primitive forests shrouded the&#xD;
earth; Annie instinctively clung closer to Graham, h~r&#xD;
terrors in spite of herself; sometimes almost overcoming&#xD;
her self.possession.&#xD;
Four hours had passed away, when in the bend of the&#xD;
bayou, far ahead, Annie saw, rising up from among the&#xD;
trees, a stately mansion. It presented 'an imposing effect&#xD;
in the dim light.&#xD;
"Is that a delusion?" said Annie, pointing to the&#xD;
house, that seemed, from the motion of the skiff; to be it-&#xD;
self moving about.&#xD;
Graham stared curiously a moment, and then recog-&#xD;
nized Annie's home; but so altered, by a thorough paint.~&#xD;
ing, since he had been away, that for a moment he did not&#xD;
know it himself.&#xD;
"That is the end of our journey; in a few moments&#xD;
more we shall be in our own house."&#xD;
"I can hardly realize' it," said Annie; "and. n~ore,&#xD;
it seems ~so strange, to see such mansions rising out of&#xD;
these desolate-looking woods."&#xD;
"To'~morrow all wilibe chai~ged. Once," he continued,&#xD;
on the banks above us, and you will see a country of sur-&#xD;
passing loveliness."&#xD;
"Go 'long dar "-" what you 'bout, Brandy "-..-." step&#xD;
along~ 'G~n. Jao~kson "+'.~ what's you doing, Logan," and&#xD;
other colloquial sounds, suddenly rose from the woods,&#xD;
&#xD;
frightening~ the owls, who, not yet fairly awake, ~vent&#xD;
whooping like Indian spirits off into the solitudes.&#xD;
"As I live," said ~-raham, to Annie, "I believe~ that&#xD;
is old Ben's voice-~.Ben----iIo! Ben," shouted Graham, so&#xD;
loudly, that he perfectly astonished Annie with his ve-&#xD;
hemence.&#xD;
"Orack," "snap," went the ox-goad, popping like a&#xD;
pistpl, while the heavy wheels of the cart, seemed to grind&#xD;
into the earth the limbs of trees over which they were&#xD;
moving.&#xD;
"Ben-Ben, I say!" again shouted Graham.&#xD;
"Whoa!" Ben was heard to say; instantly all was still,&#xD;
and again Graham called.&#xD;
The next moment there was seen,, on the banks of the&#xD;
bayou, and almost over the, skiff, the dark form of a. negro,&#xD;
over whose shoulders rested a long-handled whip.&#xD;
"Who calls old Ben down dar?" said the man,~staring&#xD;
wildly about.&#xD;
Your master," said A4raham, half vexed at old Ben's&#xD;
obtuseness.&#xD;
"Say dat agin!" said old Ben, commencing a. sort of&#xD;
extempore jig, as most expressive of his joy, at his mas-&#xD;
ter's return.&#xD;
The skiff had now fairly rounded the point, on which&#xD;
Ben stopd, and coining near him, Graham said:&#xD;
"Ben, why don't you hurry off to the Iwuse, and' tell&#xD;
Mr. Fenwick I am 'coming, with your mistress, up the&#xD;
l3ayou."            ' '&#xD;
'The negro stopped to hear no more'; in an~&#xD;
he was rushing along in the dark, like a perturbe*~&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC8057-00000046"/>&#xD;
THE MASTER'S HOUSE;&#xD;
yelling and laughing by turns, and when 'he could ~n43&#xD;
time, saying s-.&#xD;
'~ Master's come! master's come !"&#xD;
It was now completely dark; there had been notEing to&#xD;
guide the rowers, but the silver thread of the stream, re-&#xD;
lieved against th~ gloom; but in a few moments lights&#xD;
sprung up in different directions, and were seen moving to&#xD;
and fro, and finally all canie together at one point.&#xD;
Anon, the snorting of a horse, then 'the heavy tr~mp&#xD;
of hoots, and then Fenwick was heard to say,,.&#xD;
"Tbis way, you scoundrels, with those 'torches.-.-.here's&#xD;
the landing.~~&#xD;
All this seemed to Annie as if she were in a dream;&#xD;
sh&amp;amp; could not believe its reality; even Mildmay appeared&#xD;
changed; for, from the dim light reflected on his face, he&#xD;
seemed to have turned: to bronze.&#xD;
The negroes who rowed the ~" skiff" now turned it to-&#xD;
wards the concentration of lights, and in a moment more&#xD;
it ceased to 'move, for want of the proper depth of water.&#xD;
Gradually the location of things developed themselves&#xD;
to Graham; for the first time, he 'knew exactly where he&#xD;
was, and he found that between him and the solid earth&#xD;
v'was twenty feet of soft, muddy deposit of the bayou.&#xD;
As soon, however, as the skiff was discovered from the&#xD;
shore, there rushed to it 'a dozen stout negroes; many&#xD;
bearing' torches, and all aniibtis to see "ma~ter." Gra-&#xD;
ham rose up, and hurriedly saluted his dependents, and&#xD;
then~ gave' directions for *getting him out of his teihpo-&#xD;
rary difficulties. Forgetting, at the moment, that Annie&#xD;
had never seen a dozen negroes in her life, until within&#xD;
&#xD;
~~1.&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
the few days she had been on a western steamer, he or-&#xD;
dered some of :his men "to carefully lift her ashore."&#xD;
Annie heard the order with ~,stonishmei~t; it see~ned&#xD;
in the momentary exaggeration of her fears, that ,Gr4iam&#xD;
designed her for destruction, and throwing her arms around&#xD;
his neck in unqualified' terror, she exclaimed :-&#xD;
"No, no, don't consign me to these men."&#xD;
In an instant Graham comprehended Annie's feelings,&#xD;
and with an inward consciousness of deep pain at 'his&#xD;
want of consideration, he sternly commanded the officious&#xD;
negroes to stand aside; and now communicating freely with&#xD;
Fenwick, ordered him 'to get some plank or rails, and&#xD;
make such a walk, as he could, with safety, help Annie&#xD;
over himself.&#xD;
The suggestion once made, it was instantly carried into&#xD;
effect, and Annie, trembling in every limb with excite-&#xD;
ment, reached the shore.&#xD;
In a few moments more she was in her own. roomr where&#xD;
the careful "Olemmy," the house servant, had considerately&#xD;
prepared a blazing fire upon the hearth. But the excite-&#xD;
ment had confused her mind. She~was feverish and rest-&#xD;
less; her imagination was filled with dark, mysterious&#xD;
caverns, and strange-looking beings with torches, who&#xD;
seemed determined to seize hold of her in some way, and&#xD;
do her injury. Then there were the many dependents of&#xD;
Mildmay, who, in their clamorous joy, were crowding int9&#xD;
"the doors and windows to see "masters, ~r~d "mistress."&#xD;
All~ these things overcame AnDie, and she weepin~ly&#xD;
begged Graham to dispense with all attendants~ and 8it~&#xD;

congratulated herself that her travels were at an end.&#xD;
Night closed in~ the angel of peace spread her wings over&#xD;

Annie was indeed mistress of Heritage Place.'&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
AN UNSUCCESSFUL ENTERPRISE.&#xD;
STONEYYILL,1~ is one of the most pleasant towns in the ru-&#xD;
ral $tate of Vermont. It is in an out-ofthe-way nook, on&#xD;
the very' edge of the great currents of travel, yet not per-&#xD;
ceptibly influenced by theni, for it retains most of its old-&#xD;
times features, a large-number of its best houses having&#xD;
been in existence at the time of the Revolution. Stoney-&#xD;
yule is also somewhat remarkable for possessing an old&#xD;
ruin; a thing rare, indeed, in New England. Past the&#xD;
edge of the village, flowed a spring-fed stream, which, at&#xD;
the lowerpart of the town, widened into quite a deep lake.&#xD;
Upon some rocks in the centre of this sheet of~ water, had&#xD;
many years before, been built by an unsuccessful. specu-&#xD;
lator, a flour mill, now in decay; it having been discovered&#xD;
when too late, that the enterprise needed two things to&#xD;
make it succeed; ene~zgh swift-running water to turn' the&#xD;
millr and enough wheat to keep 'it busy ;both were wanted,&#xD;
but what the disappointed miller lost, the town of Sto~iey~&#xD;
ville'g~dned in the picturespe. -&#xD;
The traditions of Stoneyville are very interesting: the&#xD;

-THE. MASTER'S HoUsE ;&#xD;
&#xD;
little boys* can point out the very spot- where they say&#xD;
General Stark stood, when he made his famous address to&#xD;
his soldiers; where the Green Mountain Boys bivouacked&#xD;
a few days before the battle of Bennington. They also&#xD;
have traditions of wounded soldiers, that were brought&#xD;
into the town, and lodged in specified houses, and who died&#xD;
encouraging the living never to .surrender .their liberties&#xD;
until death.&#xD;
These incidents are characteristic of the town of Stoney-&#xD;
ville, but in them was all the bloodshed and violence that&#xD;
were familiar to the people, for no place was more peace-&#xD;
able, more primitive, than this .little village. The uses&#xD;
of law were scarcely known, the poor-house atid the jail&#xD;
were alike almost destitute of tenants. But for the many&#xD;
flourishing schools within its vicinity, and the consequent&#xD;
visiting -of anxious parents, to witness .the progress. of&#xD;
their children, Stonaeyville would have been forgotten, save&#xD;
to the little world of which it was the centre. .&#xD;
.Here it was the good fortune of Charles Broadnax, of&#xD;
whom we have heard in another chapter, to find a retreat,&#xD;
and here he had resided in peace, and would probably have&#xD;
continued to do so to the end of his days, had not his&#xD;
prosperity attracted the good-natured attention of the local&#xD;
editor; who thus, while intending .to -compliment him,&#xD;
brought .a knowledge of his whereabouts to the eye of&#xD;
Major Dixon, the bitter enemy of thie African race.&#xD;
The negro trader, in due course of time, for the accom-&#xD;
plishment of his plans, having informed himself in Wash-&#xD;
~ngton of the locality of Stoneyville, and also of the char-&#xD;
acter of its inhabitants, chuckled over the prospect of the&#xD;
&#xD;
A TALE. OF SOUTUtERN LIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
95&#xD;
&#xD;
"hell of a fuss he was going to kick uip among the Yan-&#xD;
kees ;"  and  obtaining, a  temporary commission -as&#xD;
United States Marshal; for one of his "own men," and&#xD;
selecting two others, who hung about the slave depots in&#xD;
Washington, for assistants.; armed with the " solemn au-&#xD;
thority of law," and what they deemed necessary append-&#xD;
ages, revolvers and bowie knives; the four were soon in the&#xD;
State of Vermont, and managed to remain long enough to&#xD;
concoct their plans at the railroad station, some five miles&#xD;
from Stoneyville, without, in the hurry and bustle of the&#xD;
passing to and fro, attracting any particular attention.&#xD;
Having secured a room at the railroad hotel, Dixon&#xD;
made his companions place all their weapons in his trunk,&#xD;
which he locked up ;. observing that if any of the inhabitants&#xD;
saw any of their "playthings," they would know that&#xD;
they were Southerners negro-hunting, and. give the alarm.&#xD;
He then cautioned them not to swagger, or get -intoxicated,&#xD;
but behave themselves 'until he returned ; for, ever intent&#xD;
on business, he proposed at once to proceed on foot to Sto-&#xD;
neyville; reconnoitre the place, find out where Charles was,&#xD;
lay all his plans; and then, with the assistance of his con-&#xD;
federates, make the capture.&#xD;
With these ideas, he started up the-road that led to&#xD;
his place of destination.  It was a pleasant September&#xD;
afternoon; all nature smiled,-the naturally sterile hill&#xD;
sides were mantled with ripening fruits,-and the hay&#xD;
fields filled the air with fragrance. A long way off there&#xD;
could be seen the modest spire of Stoneyville church, glis~&#xD;
tening just above the intervening hills.&#xD;
." I wonder how these ere people manage to live,"&#xD;
&#xD;

<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC8057-00000049"/>&#xD;
96             THE MASTER'S HOUSE;&#xD;
soliloquized Dixon, as he strode along; "cuss me!" he&#xD;
continued, looking around, "if they don't seem to keep&#xD;
fat on blue stone, for they've not much else to' eat:" and&#xD;
thenlooking ahead, and perceiving the spire of the church,&#xD;
that for a 'moment came in full view, he said, "Thar's a&#xD;
church; IL suppose that's the shop Charles is sexton of;&#xD;
why didn't they make him the preacher, or send him to&#xD;
Congress ?"&#xD;
Just at this moment there came rattling along a two-&#xD;
horse wagon, driven by a merry boy, some twelve years&#xD;
old; the horses in perl~eet condition, and looking fairly&#xD;
gay under their well-kept harness.&#xD;
"Wal, I rather guess you'd better ride," said the&#xD;
boy, holding' up his steeds, to get Dixon's answer.&#xD;
"How far are ycu going?" inquired Dixon, his hand&#xD;
already on the foie 'wJ~eel, ready to mount.&#xD;
"WaI, I'm goin' near tu Stoneyville, but not right tu&#xD;
it,'" said the little teamster, his eyes dancing with life and&#xD;
health.&#xD;
Another moment; and the Major was hurried along at&#xD;
a swinging trot; and being a good judge of a horse, "al-&#xD;
most as good," to~use his own language, "as he was of&#xD;
niggers," lie appeared highly delighted with his unex-&#xD;
pected good fortune.&#xD;
It seemed to Dixon but a few moments before the boy&#xD;
stopped, and. told him, althoi~gh the town was entirely&#xD;
hidden from view, that just beyond 'the spur of the hill&#xD;
~ihead, he would be at Stoneyville. Dixon jumped into&#xD;
the~ road, and taking from his pocket a twenty-five vent.&#xD;
piece, offered' it to the boy.&#xD;
&#xD;
A TALE OF SOUTHERN LIFE. '&#xD;
"I hadn't got no change," said the little fellow, gather.-&#xD;
ing up the reins to move on.&#xD;
"Never mind the change," said Dixon, laughing.&#xD;
"Wal, I hope you don't guess I'll take all that money&#xD;
fur such ~a little ride, do you?"&#xD;
"I guess you will,"~ sneeringly returned Dixon, all of&#xD;
his hatred of the Yankee character being revived by the&#xD;
nasal twang of the urchin; "I guess you will take it, and&#xD;
you'd better buy one of these farms with part of it, and&#xD;
keep the rest to' build you a house."&#xD;
The boy took the money with evident surprise at the&#xD;
liberality of the gift marked on his face, and laughed&#xD;
heartily at Dixon's remark, for he understood it exactly&#xD;
different from what it was intended; and then touching&#xD;
up his horses; soon rattled on out of 0igbt.&#xD;
Now something in all this had annoyed Dixon, and he&#xD;
strode 'on to' the village in - exceeding bad humor.. Al-&#xD;
though it was in the usual business hours of the day, he&#xD;
saw no one in the streets; the houses set back from the&#xD;
road,-the front doors were generally open,-but all was&#xD;
still. He passed one or two modest-looking stores; the&#xD;
inmates seemed to be absorbed in, boQks, or half asleep.&#xD;
At the 'extreme end of the town he. discovered an old-&#xD;
fashioned tavern sign, and to it he wended his way.&#xD;
Suddenly he heard the hum, of busy voices, merry&#xD;
laughter, and other signs of life; and it appeared 'to him&#xD;
that by a si~nultaneous movement,'    etofore quiet&#xD;
streets were alive with children. The merry urchins&#xD;
poured out from almost every house, and went whooping&#xD;
in merry troops up and down the streets. Such i~ con-&#xD;

&#xD;
tinued array of white faces, and rosy chee]~s, depressed&#xD;
Dixon; and at the moment, he would have looked upon a&#xD;
negro, if legitimately in his presence, with all the senti-&#xD;
ment of suddenly seeing among strangers a familiar face.&#xD;
Dixon soon made an interested friend of the landlord&#xD;
of the "Farmer's Inn;" and although out of the' usual&#xD;
hour, he ordered some refreshments, and then ~asked to be&#xD;
directed to the village barber. The landlord pointed him&#xD;
out the shop, and then disappeared to attend to his unex-&#xD;
pected call for a dinner.&#xD;
Charles IBroadnax lived near the centre of the village,&#xD;
and' opposite the church. Over the door, in simple let-&#xD;
ters, was the name; and on the inside, the* negro 'man&#xD;
could be seen busily dusting off 'the various articles that&#xD;
composed his stock in trade. *A dark and terrible expres-&#xD;
sion passed over the face of Dixon, as he saw the negro;&#xD;
but by~ a great effort of will, he controlled himself, and&#xD;
entered the "saloon."&#xD;
Charles, with professional courtesy, made the usual&#xD;
bow; aid asked what the gentleman would have. Dixon&#xD;
signified his desire, and in another moment was undergoing&#xD;
the necessary, but not very poetical infliction of being&#xD;
shaved. Charles was at. leisure, and took more than usual&#xD;
pains to please,; and when Dixon came from under his&#xD;
manipulations, he looked vastly improved.&#xD;
Before Dixon left, Charles's two children,, of seven and&#xD;
nine years of age, came into the shop, and leaving some&#xD;
message, immediately went out again.. Dixon paid his&#xD;
bill, and casually inquired&#xD;
"You have some~children, I see?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes," said' Charles, "I have got four."&#xD;
"And how do you like living ia this cold country?"&#xD;
inquired Dixon, pretending' to be ~very much interested&#xD;
with a picture that ornamented the wall.&#xD;
There was something in the tone of voice and manner&#xD;
of Dixon that now alarmed Charles, yet he could not tell&#xD;
why. The sound of the voice,-.the cold, distrustful, and&#xD;
evidently unsympathizing' expression,-.revived recollec-&#xD;
tions that had been slumbering in his memory for years;&#xD;
* and' yet, while his heart sunk within him, nothing visible&#xD;
to his eye seemed to justify his fears.&#xD;
Dixon saw the mental agitation of his victim, and was&#xD;
coiifirmed in his idea that he was talking to the fugi-&#xD;
tive; but to place. the matter beyond a doubt he said:&#xD;
~J rode up from the railroad depot with one of your&#xD;
citizens, and I have heard your story with a great deal of&#xD;
interest."&#xD;
"Ah!" said Charles, instantly recovering his spii~its&#xD;
(for his escape from slavery was, quite a familiar romance&#xD;
in the vicinity); "many people do talk of my having come&#xD;
from the South; but for that~ I should almost forget it&#xD;
myselt2'&#xD;
Dixxn said no more, but walked lack to the "Farm-&#xD;
ers' Inn," and commenced in excellent spirits his plain, but&#xD;
neatly dressed, and substantial dinner. The landlord&#xD;
was a garrulous man, and talked about a thousand things&#xD;
of no possible interest to Dixon; but upon that gentleman&#xD;
mentioning 'what an excellent barber the town of Stoney-&#xD;
ville was blessed with, I3onifaco went into the whole de~&#xD;
*tails of Charles's coming to the town,-his early struggle&#xD;

to maintain himself,-and 'his final triumphs ; and ~then&#xD;
launched off into .a tirade against slavery, and wound up&#xD;
with lgud denunciations on the head -of negro traders,&#xD;
whom tlie landlord said he had Charles's -authority for as-&#xD;
serting " were a paclg of thieving scoundrels, who would&#xD;
do- any thing base to selt the souls and bodies of the un-&#xD;
fortunate slave."&#xD;
" Did that nigger bai-ber say. that ?" growled Dixon,&#xD;
'as well as he could, with his mouth full of excellent pud-&#xD;
ding.&#xD;
The landlord, perfectly delighted that he had at last&#xD;
touched upon a subject that interested his guest, replied :&#xD;
"Yes,, he said that; and I'll. add," continued the&#xD;
landlord, determined to be agreeable, " that a man that&#xD;
will give himself up to'mnake a trade of selling human&#xD;
beings,-to separating parents and children,-deserves to&#xD;
go down to the bottomless pit, where there is weeping and&#xD;
wailing and gnashing of teeth."&#xD;
"That's your opinion, is it?" said Dixon, perfectly&#xD;
strangled with wrath, and purple in his face.&#xD;
" It is," said the landlord, still unconscious -of the&#xD;
effect of his remarks; " and it's the opinion of every decent&#xD;
main in the country ; "-and then pausing a moment, and&#xD;
giving his language great effect, he continued: "~ Charles&#xD;
says, that in the South even, a nigger trader is despised&#xD;
and loathed, and not allowed to sit at a gentleman's table;&#xD;
and if such is thie case ----."&#xD;
" Shut up .your infernal gab !" finally roared Dixon,&#xD;
almost in an apoplectic fit, " andl the devil take Charles !-&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
Can't you let a man eat a meal in your hose, without in-&#xD;
suiting him, you chuckle-headed, fool ?"&#xD;
The landlord fell back against the wall, overcome with&#xD;
astonishment.&#xD;
"tI hope I haven't offended you!" he said, the moment&#xD;
he could speak.&#xD;
Dixon, who had convulsively seized the carving knife&#xD;
before him, and half risen in his chair, dropped the&#xD;
weapon, and settling back in his seat, while. his face was&#xD;
still black with indignation, he begged the landlord to ex-&#xD;
cuse him, " as he was subject to flows of blood to the&#xD;
head."&#xD;
In a few moments he paid his bill, and walked preci-&#xD;
pitately into the street. The instant that he reached the&#xD;
highway, and was beyond observation and hearing, he un-&#xD;
loosed his neck-kerchief, to let the air come to his&#xD;
neck, for its veins were swelling and heaving as if heated&#xD;
by an internal fire; and then throwing his arms about him&#xD;
as if to obtain more relief, he poured out upon the land-&#xD;
lord of the " Farmers' Inn," and upon Chai-les, curses&#xD;
and maledictions that rivalled the fiends themselves; and it&#xD;
was not until he had walked the whole five miles necessary&#xD;
to reach the railroad station, that he was fairly self-pos-&#xD;
sessede&#xD;
Dixon, on his arrival among his confederates, kept up&#xD;
the discipline necessary for the best execution of his, plans.&#xD;
He would not allow them to appear mueh together in the&#xD;
street, nor would he, when observed, have, much to say to&#xD;
them himself. It has not until ten o'clock at night, thatT&#xD;
they met in their sleeping room, and discussed their plans.&#xD;

&#xD;
<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC8057-00000052"/>&#xD;
Dixon gave~ a graphic account' of his adventures at&#xD;
Stoucyville, and was further enraged by his friends' laugh-&#xD;
ter, as he detailed how the landlord, to use the deputy&#xD;
Unite&amp;amp; States marshal's language, "hit 'him under the&#xD;
short ribs;" but the conclave finally concluded, that. it&#xD;
would be a great thing gained,,'if it were possible, "to&#xD;
stake the landlord down, and give him a 'hundred,' before&#xD;
they carried off his nigger friend, Charles."&#xD;
"And how far is Stoneyville from this place ?" inquired&#xD;
the deputy marshal.&#xD;
"Five miles," said Dixon, sententiously~&#xD;
"Five miles!" repeated the marshal, pulling out an&#xD;
old watch;~ "why, Major Dixon," he continued, "it is&#xD;
now only eleven o'clock; we* can get to Stoneyville by one,&#xD;
and take the nigger in his den, asleep, and be back in time&#xD;
for the three o'clock m'brning train."&#xD;
"I know that," snarled Dixon, "I could go back alone&#xD;
to Stoneyville, and take him myself, and bring him here;&#xD;
but that isn't the thing,-I want a row,-.--I want some of&#xD;
them guessing Yankees to interfere; I want that landlord&#xD;
to get a rip with a bowie,-.---I want to make these fellows&#xD;
feel what it is to infringe on Southern rights.&#xD;
The two men, whom Dixon had hired ,to accompany&#xD;
him, finally fell into a slumber, but the deputy marshal&#xD;
seemed a 'little nervous about his "official capacity," from&#xD;
the fact,' that his commission seemed to him a profound&#xD;
delegation of terrible power, and he was constantly afraid&#xD;
that it would either be infringed upon, or not sufficiently.&#xD;

Now the major was, exceedingly well skilled in his&#xD;
business, and he had inculcated the deputy tnarshal with&#xD;
the belief that if~ he, the marshal, was successfull in this&#xD;
"particular hunt," that he might get into a flue run of&#xD;
business, and soon make- himself rich; and to further sW&#xD;
emulate his confederate, Dixon gave several illustrations of&#xD;
the profitss of fugitive hunting; but the story .he told with&#xD;
most ~ ran as follows&#xD;
"When I fust commenced this business, jt was before&#xD;
the abolitionists had created such. a fuss against the South,&#xD;
and before the slave States made the law, that a negro&#xD;
was free, if his master took him voluntarily into the north-&#xD;
ern States. The consequence was, that a great many gen-&#xD;
tlemen owned niggers, who had by travel got to be pretty&#xD;
considerable sort of gentlemen.&#xD;
"A young man, by the name of Pinekney, who at about&#xD;
twenty-one, came in possession of a large estate, took it&#xD;
into his head to have in Europe a grand sludgege" ~o he&#xD;
took his body servant, Benson, about as white as niggers&#xD;
ever get to be, and started off. I think Benson' told me'&#xD;
that his master stayed abroad about ten years, and visited&#xD;
all the kings and queens, and courted du~hesses,~and all&#xD;
that sort of thing; Benson. half the time passing for his&#xD;
companion, and' all the time treated as if he was, no mis-&#xD;
take,' white.&#xD;
"When Piuckney got back home again, he found his&#xD;
funds rather low; and having got a taste for cards and&#xD;
horses, he went down South, and commenced the genteel&#xD;
gambler, and floured on the race track; and it was gene-&#xD;
rally given in, that if it hadn't been for Benson's smartness,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC8057-00000053"/>&#xD;
he'd a gone. to the dogs in less time than it takes to brand&#xD;
ow a race track, Mr. Deputy Marshal, isabad&#xD;
place for fools,~~ had place for a man that loses hi~&#xD;
senses in drinking too much-4 flaYer do that,.-.and a bad&#xD;
place f~r a bird, any way, that is rather loose in his&#xD;
feathers. Be that as it may, Pinckney soon had fastened&#xD;
on him' a shrewd man, who determined to get Benson from&#xD;
him, by fair means or foul; and so he stuck to him with&#xD;
"marked cards;" and pisening his race horses, and bribing&#xD;
their riders, until Puuckney put up Benson against fifteen&#xD;
hundred dollars, and lost him on the race track, easier&#xD;
than a turtle rolls off a log.&#xD;
"Now, the~man that wonBenson didn't live ma pal-&#xD;
ace, or have any duchesses about '1dm, I tell you. lie' oc-&#xD;
cupied a log~cabiu, eat corned pork, and amused himself&#xD;
drinking whiskey, running horses,, and hunting niggers. He&#xD;
was a real ~spiited gentleman, but rat imprudent in&#xD;
whipping, for he, used to lay it on when he got mad, so that&#xD;
the nigger never got over it, and that is a foolish wasting&#xD;
of property, for you see 1~fr. Deputy, there is no feeling ma&#xD;
nigger's hide below the skin, and if you will take time, you&#xD;
can get it all out of his body without touching a vital-.-~but&#xD;
howsomever,. the man had a right to kill 'em if lie could&#xD;
afford to, for a person should do as he pleases 'with his&#xD;
own.&#xD;
"As soon as this man won Benson, who stoo&amp;amp;;hy, dress~&#xD;
ed up in the very clothes he brought from Fra~n~e, and a&#xD;
gdd watch. lii his pocket, he said very mildly: 'lienson,'&#xD;
my boy; that balfxieck ahead of my horse as they came out&#xD;

at the stand, made m&amp;amp;y~ur master; now I have a preju~-&#xD;
dice agin dandy niggers, agin learned niggers, a&#xD;
white niggers; and as I don't fancy the airs Mr. '~ ~o y&#xD;
puts on, I think I'll commence your education by whipping&#xD;
out of your hide all the gyrations~he's lamed yow; and if&#xD;
you live through it, maybe you'll make a good eottou pi~ker&#xD;
at last,' and as 'the winner said this, he commenced with-&#xD;
out further ceremony belting Benson with a heavy whip,&#xD;
every stroke of which cut the hroadcloth into finders.&#xD;
"Now, Pinckney (who was drunk when he putup Ben-&#xD;
son as a stake, for he would have sacrificed his life for the&#xD;
boy had he been sober), seeing the man strike ~Benson, lie.&#xD;
drew a knife, and demanding' how any one dared to strike&#xD;
his nigger, rushed in, and a general fight ensued{ but a~&#xD;
might be expec1I~ed, the gamblers got the'~ advantage, for'&#xD;
they cut up Punckney awful, ~o he died the next Jay~but'&#xD;
the nigger disappeared, and~wasn't seen afterwards.&#xD;
"Now Benson understood that li.e had bean lo8t on. a&#xD;
bet, and determining not to go with 'his. new rnast~r, the&#xD;
moment the fight eommenc~d~'he slipped ~out of sight; hid&#xD;
away in the woods, and 'hailed the first boat going te Ciii-.&#xD;
cunuati after he got to Vh~ Mississippi River,- ~ud was ta-&#xD;
ken on board and treated all the way like ~ gentleman, iLo&#xD;
one on the boat even ~uspectung that he wa~ a darkee,&#xD;
much les8 a runaway slave.&#xD;
"Benson found his way of course to the British posses-&#xD;
sious, and If our government' at Washington had any spunk,&#xD;
it woiil4 declare war on Canada, .jnst to get the runaways;&#xD;
that's the Way it served the Seminoles, and a very ~re1~ty&#xD;

self up for a gentleman at large, and as he could talk about&#xD;
crowned he~ds,.pioters~ and all that sort' of nonsense., he was&#xD;
looked upon as the perlitest man ever was seen, and you'd&#xD;
scarcely believe it, set up a perfumery store and married an&#xD;
English woman, as handsome Thu told as any in the coun-&#xD;
try."&#xD;
The deputy marshal, who had listened up to this mo-&#xD;
ment in profound silence; at the statement of ~he marriage,&#xD;
rolled up his eyes i~i astonishment, and said&#xD;
"Oh; Ma~j~or!' You're going it too strong."&#xD;
"Not a bit of it; for you see Benson was a white nig-&#xD;
~ger, and it took a good judge 'to 4iow the cross. I have,"&#xD;
'he continued, "paid' a'heap~of money out to settle this very&#xD;
question of how white a nigger can be.&#xD;
"'Twas 'only six years ago, I bought, near Richmond,&#xD;
for a friend of mine in' Orleans' a real blue-eyed white nig-&#xD;
ger girl~;~ and 'after I got her on the ship, a habeas corpus&#xD;
was got out, to pro~Ire. 'sh&amp;amp; was clear white.' Her lawyer&#xD;
took the ground that she was free-for, 'you see it was ar-&#xD;
gued according to the Virginny statute, 'that every person&#xD;
who had one fourth negro blood should be deemed a nigger,&#xD;
and that every person who had less than that should have&#xD;
a certificate if being white. 'Twas a hard struggle for&#xD;
twenty 'hundred dollars, I toll you, for the man' I bought&#xD;
the girl of, had taken the money and left.'&#xD;
"Fortunately the girl had~i't any education.; she looked&#xD;
beautiful, and :being only fifteen, w~s worth to a young feb&#xD;
low with plenty of money, three thousand as she stood, and&#xD;
as ahe~c~uldn't plead her case, ~nd didn't-'see~n 'to care,~'&#xD;
when I ~howed them that the inside of her hands was&#xD;
&#xD;
c~ ~ittZe smootho' than ordinary white folks, and the dark&#xD;
line down the spine; the justice give in and l~ took her off;&#xD;
but, for that,~it would have been as good 'as losing Mi ordi.&#xD;
nary niggers, as things then stood.&#xD;
"'But 4S £ was saying about Benson; he took to the per-&#xD;
fumery business, andimarried a white wife, and got to be a&#xD;
great man in his way, I tell you. There helived, not even&#xD;
his fellow-runaways suspecting that he had ever seen .a slave&#xD;
State. But a Southern man, wh~ had, seen Bensoii on the&#xD;
race track, recognized him in Canada, atid it got to my ears,&#xD;
and the first'time I was down in Louisiana after II heard&#xD;
of his whereabouts, I bought out his master's interest 1~or&#xD;
fifty dollars1 and took a regular bill of sale.'&#xD;
"I expected to 'have a~ deal of trouble? if I ever 'got&#xD;
Benson at all, but he' walked into the trap I set for him&#xD;
like a bumble-bee into a sugar hogshead. Just one letter,&#xD;
pi~etending to be from a New York merchant, that wanted&#xD;
to see him in Detroit, brought him under the American flag&#xD;
and into a pair of handcuffs."&#xD;
"And what became of him at last?" asked the deputy&#xD;
marshal.&#xD;
"Why17' said Dixon, rising up and walkiz~ig aboQt the&#xD;
room, "as a mex~e money speculation, Benson turned out&#xD;
badly. I spent three hundred' dollars to 'get him to St.&#xD;
Louis;' and carried him 'gagged and tied all the way, rind&#xD;
when I got him fairly in limbo, after all niytrouble, hehad&#xD;
the ingratitude to hang. himself to the rafters, and ~so give&#xD;
me the slip after all."&#xD;
"And what1~came of his wife?" asked the marshal with&#xD;
more interest than he had at any other time displayed.&#xD;

"I don't know," said nixon, with an equivocal smile on&#xD;
hi~ fa~e,~~" but I remember that the~ papers and the aboli-&#xD;
tionists at the time ~made ~ great Aieal of fuss about it, and&#xD;
said the woman went crazy; but the idea of a white woman&#xD;
going crazy for a nigger, was working the sentimental with&#xD;
too much steam. on, and I never thought about the subject&#xD;
afterwards."&#xD;
A 'few orders in the morning were given by Dixon, and&#xD;
the men waJked rapidly on their way. At this moment you&#xD;
eould scarcely distinguish the quiet storyteller of the pre.&#xD;
vious night, with the man as he appeared under the grow-&#xD;
ing excitement of making a capture. He seemed to be a&#xD;
bead taller;~ there was ~an erectness 'about his figure, a fire&#xD;
in his eye, and an expression in his face that was really im-&#xD;
'pressive, and he seemed to inspire his followers with hi~&#xD;
own defiant s)pirit.~&#xD;
The streets of Stoneyville, as the men entered at differ-&#xD;
ent points, were alive with 'children~ going to school, and&#xD;
with citizens on their way to their daily avocations. Dixon,&#xD;
always in sight of his fellow' laborers, walked straight up&#xD;
to Charles's shop, and peeping in at the window, discovered&#xD;
the object ot his search busily employed in dressing the&#xD;
hair of a reverend-looking gentleman. Raising his' finger,&#xD;
the deputy marshal, white with fear and excitement, came&#xD;
within a few yards of him, while the hired assistants had&#xD;
reached stations near Dixon eqi~idistant up and down the&#xD;
Street.&#xD;
The moment that every thing was ready, Dixo~i tapped&#xD;
on the door, and ~Oharles, comb in hand, stepped forward&#xD;
and opened it, and as he put his head out, Dixon seized him&#xD;
&#xD;
with his left hand by the collar and jerked him into the&#xD;
street, at the same instant striking him a ~tuxming blow on&#xD;
his head with a heavy dub.&#xD;
The negro reeled, staggered against the ~side of the&#xD;
house 'and fell on his knees.&#xD;
"Where the heR are the handcuffs?" said Dixon to the&#xD;
deputy, while his other assistants rushed up, and according&#xD;
to instructions, with loud voices and imprecations warned&#xD;
the citizens, who were gathering round, not to interfere&#xD;
with the officers of the UniVed~ States. The moment, how.&#xD;
ever, that the iron touched Oharles, he ~seemed to com~re~&#xD;
hend his situation, and ere the four men~had succeeded in&#xD;
perfectly securing both" of his wrists, with &amp;amp; herculean&#xD;
effort he: broke. his hold, and rising on his feet, the~ blood&#xD;
streaming down his forehead and cheeks, lie dashe4 the&#xD;
dangling handcuffS in Dixon's face, broke from th~ grasp&#xD;
of his enemies, and amid a shower of bullets, and alniost&#xD;
stripped of his clothing, ran a short distance and plunged&#xD;
into the deep but narrow river that flowed by' the town.  2&#xD;
Dixon followed him to the river bank, the deputy marshal&#xD;
meantime waving his commission over his Eeadand calling&#xD;
on the people to assist him in carrying into effect the sacred&#xD;
laws of the land and stand by the constitution.&#xD;
The firing of the~pistols brought the whole population&#xD;
into the streets, at the head of which, auti close to Dixou's&#xD;
heels, was the clergyman who was under Charles's profess ,&#xD;
sional care at 'the moment of the arrest. By the time the&#xD;
deputy marshal had finished his call upon the people to&#xD;
stand by the constitution, the clergymanhad recovered from&#xD;
~ his astonishment and comprehended the scene before him,&#xD;

&#xD;
and jumping upon an'old Ji&amp;amp;rse-block near by, he said in a&#xD;
loud voice:'&#xD;
"Men and brethren, Thou shalt not deliver unto his&#xD;
master the servant which is escaped from hisi master&#xD;
unto thee. The fugitive, he shall dwell ~with thee, even&#xD;
among you, in that place which he shall choose, in one&#xD;
of. tky gates, 'where it liketh him best,* thou shalt iiot&#xD;
o~~ress him."&#xD;
This appeal to the crowd was unnecessary, for no one&#xD;
had yet by word or deed ~offered to assist, or. interfere&#xD;
~ the "officers of~ justice; " and the victim was mo-&#xD;
~~itarily out of sight; b~it he was soon discovered climb-&#xD;
ing up ;the ~timbers of the old ,dam, ~which once formed part&#xD;
of the ruined and neglected:mill. The moment Dixon saw&#xD;
him he raised his revolver, and sang out:&#xD;
"Come back h~re audi surrender yourself; you infernal&#xD;
black d-..-i, or I'll make a honeycomb of your kinky&#xD;
~comehere, I say,"-and at the same time. Dixon&#xD;
fired ~on&amp;amp; or two ineffectual shots.&#xD;
Gentlemen," continuedthe clergyman, "in the name&#xD;
of'bumani~y~-.-.in the name of our blessed Savio~ur,.-.have&#xD;
mercy!"&#xD;
"Stand ~out of the way, you miserable, chanting, ~bo-&#xD;
litiou towhead I" ~ercely, enunciated Dixon, and with the&#xD;
side of lije pistol-barrel rudely' thrusting the clergyman&#xD;
away..&#xD;
Charles meanwhile seemed to somewhat recover him-&#xD;
self, audhalf walked. and half crawled along the old dam,,&#xD;
and got into the mill; and in a moment more, reached the&#xD;
&#xD;
top, and passing~ out upon a kug piece of naked timber,'&#xD;
seemed for the instant to be suspended in t~e air.'&#xD;
"Now fire away, you human tigers!" he cried, shak-&#xD;
ing his 'manacled arm over his head; '.' I don't want to&#xD;
live any longer, since this disgrace has been put upon me.&#xD;
'Fire away, I say!"&#xD;
"Obey the laws of the United States, you treason-&#xD;
loving renegadee" replied the deputy marshal, shaking his&#xD;
documents frantically towards Charles.&#xD;
"God have' mercy on the makers 'of su~h law~t"&#xD;
faintly murmured the' fugitive, as his bQdy swayed': to and'&#xD;
fro, and he fefl headlong down; apparently striking agi*4ns'ti&#xD;
the projecting logs, and disappeared amid the singing,'&#xD;
surging 'waters, that foamed and gurgled 'in the abyss&#xD;
below. , ' , , ' ' ' '&#xD;
An exclamation of horror went up f~~om the crowd,&#xD;
mingled with the cries of "shame! shame! ',' when Dixon&#xD;
turned coolly round to his assistants,~ and said:&#xD;
"Dead niggers are not worth taking South, anyhow,&#xD;
and replacing' his revolver in hi~ belt, he turned to the&#xD;
minister, now entirely petrified 'with horror, an&amp;amp;~remin4ed&#xD;
him that there was a funeral'~on hand, that dex~ianded his&#xD;
attention.&#xD;
Several men stripped themselves of their eoats,'~ and&#xD;
plunged into the river, and swam toward the mill; a feel-&#xD;
ing of bitter indignation began to show itse~lf~ Mr. reu-&#xD;
dleton, Charles's old~ friend, asked of Dixon his author-&#xD;
ity for his acts, and then read with care the deputy's com-&#xD;

his 'eompanion~, unmolested,. retreated slowly, keeping at&#xD;
bay, apd were soon out of sight, and for the moment for-&#xD;
gotten in the excItement to learn the fate of Charles.&#xD;
Well," said Diron to his companions, as he proceeded&#xD;
down the road, "we have seen more white livers to-day&#xD;
thap~ would feed all the hounds in Texas. If four. North-~&#xD;
eners had come into a Southern town with a federal com-&#xD;
mission, or any other commission, and attempted to cut up&#xD;
~ 'devil as we did to-day at Stoneyville, what would have&#xD;
I~h the effect ?~"&#xD;
~' Why," said the deputy promptly, "they'd a got&#xD;
ducked in the river, or rode out of town on a raiL"&#xD;
"They'd a got worse than that," said Dixon, with a&#xD;
leer; southernn people would never stand by and see&#xD;
strangers serve a dog so! but these Yankees,-talk to 'em&#xD;
about the law, and ~show 'em a bowie or a pistol, and they&#xD;
wilt up like tobacco leaves touched with frost."&#xD;
The negro, though nearly dead when found, seemed&#xD;
by a miracle to have escaped with~ life. His body Jay&#xD;
bleeding~rntilated, and insensible,-~---not in the water, as&#xD;
was supposed, but among the matted logs. With diffi-&#xD;
~ulty he was restored to oonsciousness~ and then only to&#xD;
rave about the manacle on his wrist, and express a desire&#xD;
to die.&#xD;
Never was there before witk~in the memory of the old-&#xD;
est inhabitant, so sad a day at Stoneyville. Citizens pro-&#xD;
verbially~.of the xnild~st and most~unex~citable dispositions,&#xD;
seemed each hour to become more and more incensed, and&#xD;
wefte ready at any future occasion to resist by violence, all&#xD;
&#xD;
laws where their execution involved such outrages as had&#xD;
been witnessed that day; and ~t nightfall, there went up&#xD;
from the flreside5 of Stoneyvill'~ a deep aTud bitter denun-&#xD;
ciation of slavery.&#xD;
In spite of every exertion of Mr. Peui4leton, Dixon and&#xD;
his men got to the railroad station, and escaped without&#xD;
interruption; and one or two hours taking them beyond&#xD;
the jurisdiction of Vermont, they wended their way rap-&#xD;
idly, and without fear, toward the protecting walls of the&#xD;
Federal Capitol.&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;
THE QUIET CLOSE OF DAY.&#xD;
'"Mns. MILDMAY" performed her simple duties as mis-&#xD;
tress of Heritage Place with due dignity. Provided with&#xD;
the best possible servants, her time passed on' with little&#xD;
more real care than if she had been Miss Annie Hastings in&#xD;
her New England home. Mildmay took advantage of the&#xD;
pleasant mornings to engage ,with her in agreeable horse-&#xD;
back rides through the splendid adjoining forests, and the&#xD;
evenings were passed in reading, or, as Annie herself ob-&#xD;
served, "appreciating the luxury.of being in the open air."&#xD;
The enervating, character of the climate, however, had&#xD;
its effect upon, her constitution, and she suffered at times&#xD;
that approach to indisposition which comes from extreme&#xD;
lassitude, and want' of varied mental excitement. Con-&#xD;
fined sometimes to her room all day, at sunset she would&#xD;
cause Clemmy to move an easy chair upon the broad gal-&#xD;
lery of the house; and there sl~e would sit. and watch the&#xD;
stars, which, in a clear southern sky, seem to come rush~&#xD;
ing into existence, on the sudden disappearance of the sun&#xD;
in the west~&#xD;
&#xD;
Mildmay, who had himself a keen sense of the beauti-&#xD;
ful in nature, as he was meaning one evening against' the&#xD;
heavy columns, watching the close of day, heard' ~he ligbt&#xD;
footsteps, and 'turning round, he receive Annie 'Wit~. a&#xD;
smile; ana then assisting (5lemmy in arranging her easy&#xD;
chair, and seeing that Annie was luxuriously b~iried in&#xD;
the soft cushions, and properly provided by an array of&#xD;
shawls as a reserved guard against the chilliness of ap-&#xD;
proaching night, he seated himself nearly in, front of&#xD;
her, and taking out 'his cigar-casey he ordered Prince to&#xD;
get him "alight;" and having done all this, he said '~&#xD;
"A few moments more, Annie, and you would have&#xD;
lost this brilliant sunset."&#xD;
Prince instantly returned, bringing a living coal upon&#xD;
the~ prong of an ivory.handled fork; Graham blew off&#xD;
the mouldering ashes, and lit his delicate Havana: then&#xD;
assuming an easy attitude, he gave one puff, and said,&#xD;
"Thus, Annie, the aborigines dedicated the 'fragrance of&#xD;
the weed to their gods; I, more devout and more useful,&#xD;
shall let these fleeting clouds serve to destroy the xnosqui-&#xD;
toes, already singing round you.'~&#xD;
"You are no~~the, first enthusiast that, in making au&#xD;
offering, has given the fabled deities the least substantial&#xD;
part of the sacrifice," said Ar4nie, rousing as if from a&#xD;
reverie.&#xD;
"Well," exclaimed Graham, "if I were not so comfort-&#xD;
able just now, and 'so determin'4di not even to think, I&#xD;
might reply to your unorthodox rernark0, regarding my&#xD;
disinterestedness."&#xD;
"Then," returned Annie, "perhaps yoiz will explain&#xD;

to me the secret charm of' that rude seat, so much a. fa-&#xD;
'vorite; one would think it was made for very square, and&#xD;
very straight-backed people, judging from its 'form."'&#xD;
"There again," said Grahan~;~ "what a pampered&#xD;
girl; you eschew my compliments, and now question the&#xD;
integrity of my throne: surely, being half buried in the&#xD;
deep cushion folds of that old 'arm-chair,' makes one an&#xD;
egotist. But, my lady fair, yonder is a scene that can&#xD;
have naught but admiration!" and he pointed to the west.&#xD;
The sun wa~ now in the very effulgence of its departing&#xD;
glory, and reflected a warm orange tinge upon the face of&#xD;
Annie; giving her eyes, already softened by - debility, a&#xD;
true sultana look. Behind her chair stood Cleinmy,..-her&#xD;
dark and good-natured features glistening like bronze; at&#xD;
Annie's feet, reposed Ponce de Leon; his&#xD;
eye, however,&#xD;
was ever vigilant, and seemingly eager to pick a quarrel&#xD;
with Clemmy for being so near hi~ mistress. Mildmay&#xD;
had put on his college skullcap, the heavy tassel fastened&#xD;
to it~ top hanging nearly to his shoulder; his "blouse"&#xD;
was loose and flowing, while the smoke of his cigar curled&#xD;
lazily about hi~ head~ Prince had quietly slipped back to&#xD;
his place on the gallery, and went fast asleep.&#xD;
"It is beautiful! very beautiful !" half whispered&#xD;
Annie, as she beheld the vast clouds rolling about, chang-&#xD;
ing into a thousand hues, and leaving between the distant&#xD;
forms glimpses of distance, which seemed the openings to&#xD;
other worlds.&#xD;
"And,~~ continued Annie, with some animation, "see&#xD;
you n~t those vast ranges of almost zenith-reaching moun~&#xD;
&#xD;
tains, glit~tening in pink and gold; how they are melting,&#xD;
even while we gaze, into purple and blue?"&#xD;
Mildmay looked at his wife with admiration, but made&#xD;
no reply.&#xD;
"And," continued Annie, almost rising from her chair,&#xD;
"see you not .those grand peaks, and precipitous sides,&#xD;
among which I fancy I can find the familiar forms of those&#xD;
old giant sentinels, that look out upon Maiden?"&#xD;
"True," half murmured Mildmay, buried in deep re-&#xD;
flection; "there's the old blue ridge itself."&#xD;
"What a pity, Mildmay," suggested Annie, respect-&#xD;
fully, "that these rich lands of the South have not some&#xD;
granite hills to break up their sameness; I have a fancy&#xD;
that mountains cherish freedom of thought, as well as per-&#xD;
fect health; is it not thus ?"&#xD;
"So records history," returned Mildmay, eyeing with&#xD;
anxious expression the placid appearance of Annie's face.&#xD;
A few more flashes, and struggling of the god of 4ay,&#xD;
and scarcely a tinge of his glory was left; the pleasant&#xD;
evening breeze now sprang up, and laughed among the&#xD;
hard crisp leaves of the magnolia trees.&#xD;
And now might be seen moving quietly aeros~ the&#xD;
yard some living thing, scarcely perceptible in the du~k;&#xD;
on it comes, hesitatingly ascends the gallery stairs, and&#xD;
stopping at their head, stands, hat in hand, in statue-like&#xD;
silence.&#xD;
Ponce de Leon is on his feet; he gives a slight growl&#xD;
of alarm, and appears. ready for a defence or attack..&#xD;
"Who's that on the gallery ~ "~ inquired Mildmay,&#xD;
without moving hi~ heaa.&#xD;

"It's Ben, if you please, master," replied the negro in&#xD;
a weak'voice.&#xD;
"And what is the matter with Ben ?"&#xD;
"Ize had de fever all day, and I feel sort o' weak in&#xD;
de legs," said the negro, without ~6ving from his place.&#xD;
"And what have you been doing all day, Ben?"&#xD;
"Ize been log-rolling myself, but de gang was down' in&#xD;
de cornfield cutting out grass."&#xD;
"And how are they getting on, Ben?"&#xD;
"Oh, bery well, master; 'em alers work when you&#xD;
come to see 'em"&#xD;
"Well, Ben, go down and tell Judy, that I say she&#xD;
must give you something to make you well."&#xD;
"Yes, master;" and "the 'boy" disappeared.&#xD;
The climate of the South, and the 'influence of the&#xD;
ancient population" 'of Louisiana, have unitedly created&#xD;
demand, and a taste, for large and luxuriant sleeping&#xD;
apartments. Prominent,~ among the articles of furniture&#xD;
are th~ armoire;' and the.coiw1&amp;amp;'dt~ lit.. The c~moire, of&#xD;
~nassive proyortions, is always composed of the richest of&#xD;
materialss, and is very often inlaid with. costly and' differ-&#xD;
ent tinted 'woods, the panels are composed of costly mir-&#xD;
ror~ that reach almost from the floor 'to the ceiling." In&#xD;
these receptacles one finds in bright array, not only' 'the&#xD;
splendid ornaments' of the' bride,' but in' a provided place,&#xD;
repose the jewelled casket, the perfumed notes, the thousand&#xD;
cherished records of the inmost heart. The couch du lit,&#xD;
i~ formed of four ponderous posts, surmounted by a heavy&#xD;
canopy, from whieh' depends the delicate but necessaryy&#xD;
mosquito netting. Underneath, is a couch, large 'enough&#xD;
&#xD;
for giants, yet of more luxuriance than tl~at on which&#xD;
Imogen reposed. The proud affection of 1~fl1dmay had sur-&#xD;
rounded Annie with all the elegant associations of the&#xD;
most favored of her sex, and many cherished menientoes of&#xD;
her New England home, mingled with the costlier appur-&#xD;
tenances, and gave the charm of familiarity to all.&#xD;
In one corner of the room, was a costly ~japan work-&#xD;
table, a present to Annie in her childhood, from a bachelor&#xD;
uncle, whose business it was to go down to the sea in ships~&#xD;
The grotesque figures upon this memento, of horrible dra-&#xD;
gons, swallowing beautiful young ladies with pigtails, and&#xD;
flowers of every possible hue, with gold leaves and red&#xD;
stalks, and birds lying through houses, and children run~&#xD;
ning to wast~ in the air, had greatly amused Annie in her&#xD;
very youth, and in after years, had been the subject of&#xD;
much philosophic speculation-but now, nothing could, so&#xD;
excite the tenderest emotions of her heart, as the sight&#xD;
of those oriental absurdities-made familiar and sanctifie4'&#xD;
by so many pleasing associations.&#xD;
If Annie was ever overpowered by the heat and langu~.&#xD;
of the day, or felt the influence of those moments ~&#xD;
pondency that will at times come over the happiesV of hu..&#xD;
man hearts; it was only while leaning upon this tabk, that&#xD;
the consoling influence of tears came to her relief; :and&#xD;
alike soothed and. strengthened, would she leave this do-&#xD;
mestic shrine.&#xD;
Olemmy, concluding her supper and her gossiping in&#xD;
the kitchen~~ returned to the gallery~wher&amp;amp;she busied her-&#xD;
self in setting back the ohairs,'closing the window blinds,'&#xD;

120            TIlE MASTER'S HOUSE;&#xD;
and other almost nameless but necessary duties, when, ac-&#xD;
cording to her wont, she went into her mistress's room.&#xD;
Now Clemmy had, on the afternoon of this particular&#xD;
day, rendered herself exceedingly useful in the flower gar-&#xD;
den, which labor had caused her to neglect her household&#xD;
duties, and she now, after lighting a wax candle, and&#xD;
placing it under a tall glass shade, discovered the omission                              - ~      ~AjJI&#xD;
of drawing the mosquito netting.&#xD;
Proceeding leisurely to remedy this neglect, with the&#xD;
instinctive feeling of reverence for things tasteful, so pecu-&#xD;
liar to negroes, she with more than usual care removed&#xD;
the ruffled pillows, and then carefully folded back the fine&#xD;
linen of snowy whiteness ~~over the rose4inted counter-&#xD;
pane.; then replacing the pillows at the head of the bed,&#xD;
she~ei~ed thesilken tassel pendent from the foot of the                                       __&#xD;
tester, an4 gave the bar a jerk, that instantly expanded it&#xD;
like a delicate cloud over the couch beneath-and tucking&#xD;
in the edges of the bar, she next arranged the different                      ~        ~          ~&#xD;
vases, bask9ts, and nicknacks, according to her ideas.&#xD;
Then with evident pettishness she removed Annie's Bible to                -~ ~      4'  ~          I&#xD;
the mantelpiece,, and replaced it by a magnificently bouxid&#xD;
volume, which was lying open upon' the lounge-she then&#xD;
stepped into -the centre of the room and gave an admiring&#xD;
glance; every thing in the room met with her perfect ap-&#xD;
probation; but the disposition of the gaylybpund volume&#xD;
on the Japan table was her master Conception.&#xD;
The-night air growing too cool, and the mine o'clock&#xD;

nations by herself.&#xD;
Olemmy was within hearing, but evidently from a per-&#xD;
t'eet understanding, she continued staring into vacancy, as&#xD;
if no one was near, leaving Annie to~proceed uninterrupted&#xD;
to her room. The young mistress wore a quiet and satis-&#xD;
fled expression, there was a slight tinge of pleasure warming&#xD;
up her cheek, it was evident that the evening had been&#xD;
agreeably spent. On entering as if performing a customary&#xD;
task, she carefully returned her Bible to its appointed place,&#xD;
leaving the favorite binding of Olemmy to ignobly repose&#xD;
its splendor upon the brass nails of one of Mlldmay's much&#xD;
worn travelling trunks. Annie then sat down beside her&#xD;
little table, and for some moments leaned her head upon&#xD;
her hand; then, with her costly handkerchief she listlessly&#xD;
brushed away some suppositions dust from the faces of&#xD;
numerous little Japanese monsters, and taking up the sa-&#xD;
cred volume, she a~urned to a specific pface, buried her fore-&#xD;
finger among the parted 1ea~es, and seemed fQr a while to be&#xD;
musing over the events of the day; then opening the volume&#xD;
she read, in a low and musical voice, the twenty-fourth&#xD;
chapter of St. Lukejr and throwing herself upon her knees,&#xD;
poured forth her soul in spontaneous prayer to Heaven,&#xD;
calling down blessings upon her friends at a distance,&#xD;
near by, her husband and herself.&#xD;
Annie had scarcely risen from her kneeling position,&#xD;
before Clemmy slipped noiselessly into tb i~cin, and with&#xD;
some officiousness prepared to assist her ii~ress in her&#xD;
toilet for the night. Annie would willingl~a~e~d~nsed&#xD;

&#xD;
not allow her to ~repel Clemmy's affectionate zeal; she there-&#xD;
fore kindly received from her hands the snowy robe de&#xD;
7~.&amp;amp;27t, ~nd carefully adjusting it, and placing her comb on&#xD;
the table, thereby leaving her luxuriant hair to fall over&#xD;
her shoulders, she with forced resignation abandoned her-&#xD;
self to the hands of her faithful~ domestic.&#xD;
Clemmy was now happy; it was the honor of arrang-&#xD;
ing those magnificent c~rl~, that was the pride of her ex-&#xD;
istence, and made her the envy of all he~ fellow servants.&#xD;
Annie herself could not help being amused, as she discov-&#xD;
ered the sable face of admiration and triumph reflected&#xD;
over her shoulder in the gIa~s.&#xD;
Cleinmy skilfully swept away the masses of curls from&#xD;
Annie's brow, which transformed her. loveliness into a sim-&#xD;
plicity that would have been commended by the most rigid&#xD;
puritan of her race. The labor ended, she aroused herself,&#xD;
and stepped toward the bed.&#xD;
Clemmy, meantime, had seized her gigantic fly brush,&#xD;
in which glistened and waved the rich plumage of a host of&#xD;
Juno's birds, and swinging it in the air, made a soft zephy-~&#xD;
rous nois~, and at the same time, in the most artistic man-&#xD;
ner she prepared to lift the edge of the mosquito bar, gave&#xD;
the signal, and Annie sprang through the opening with a&#xD;
bound. -&#xD;
The busy hum of myriads of insects, thus, by almost&#xD;
necromancy, cheated of their prey, but made the protec-&#xD;
tion of the netting more deliciously secure, and Annie was&#xD;
soon wandering in that mysterious world, where things&#xD;
past and present, ~u~1 already realized hopes, mingle in&#xD;
incongruous y&amp;amp;~x~ Jia~monious combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
AN ORDER DISOBEYED.&#xD;
&#xD;
As with all wealthy planters, the most perplexing care&#xD;
to Mildmay, was the management of the overseer. To this&#xD;
individual, the proprietor has to delegate immense authority,&#xD;
and yet the very qualities essential for an overseer, almost&#xD;
necessarily suppose, that he Will not, and cannot be a refin-&#xD;
ed and responsible man. Mildmay had his share of diffl~&#xD;
culties after Fenwick left him, but he at length employed&#xD;
a "Mr. Toadvine," who could command readily in the&#xD;
neighborhood a liberal salary, and was well recommended.&#xD;
Mildmay, upon concluding his agreement with Toad~ine,&#xD;
gave him some general in8tructions, Proscribing on his&#xD;
place the use of a certain kind of whip, and incidentally&#xD;
mentioning, that if Jack,. one of the "field hands," should&#xD;
at any time need correction, he desired that it would not&#xD;
be administered without his, Mildniay's, knowledge.&#xD;
Some months after Toadvine was installed in his office,&#xD;
the unexpected announcement, by Mr. Mildmay, that busi-&#xD;
ness would call him away from hom~1~~*o or three days,&#xD;
caused a feeling of universal gratt4 n4n the mind of the&#xD;
&#xD;
123&#xD;

&#xD;
TUE MASTER'S HOUSE;&#xD;
&#xD;
overseer, and the very morning on which he~ saw from his&#xD;
station in the field, that i~1ildmay had departed on his jour-&#xD;
ney, he returned to his house at the head of "the quarters,"&#xD;
and taking down the "proscribed lash," he carefully and&#xD;
artistically proceeded to soften its material, and by repeat-&#xD;
ed twisting, wringings, and drawing it through his tightly&#xD;
grasped hand, he brought it at last to a satisfactory state&#xD;
of toughness and pliability. Then rising up and going out&#xD;
of doors he whirled it around his head, and raking delib-&#xD;
erate aim at a cypress splinter, nearly the size of his little&#xD;
finger, that obtruded from the boards of the fence, he cut&#xD;
it off with the end of the lash, as smoothly as if it had been&#xD;
done with the edge of his bowie.knife; he then playfully&#xD;
singled out fair surfaces on the side of his cabin, and imd&#xD;
pressed upon them at each blow, various hieroglyphic char-&#xD;
acters with his whip, and although no particular effort was&#xD;
made, he burie&amp;amp; the snapper deeply into the somewhat&#xD;
time-softened wood.&#xD;
"I reckon that'll do," at last muttered the aggrieved&#xD;
man, "that'll do,-I'll teach Mr. Mildmay that niggers is&#xD;
niggers, atid that he can't come back here from the free&#xD;
States with his damned infernal abolition notions, and in-&#xD;
terfere in my business. If any of his hands 'aint got thar&#xD;
share of whipping 'fore night it'll be no fault of mine."&#xD;
Just at that moment, the front rate of the quarter in-&#xD;
closure opened, and in rode'" Col. Price," the overseer of&#xD;
the "Mor~eton estate." Toadvine saluted his friend, asked&#xD;
him to dismount, and they both entered the house.&#xD;
"I came ~ said Price, "to ask you to let me have&#xD;
the timber wheels; I think ~of going into the swamp this&#xD;
&#xD;
A TALE OF SOUTHERN LIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
'125&#xD;
&#xD;
e'I*ening for ~saw-log~, and Mr. Mildinay told me 'fore he&#xD;
left that I could get 'em if not in use."&#xD;
"It's a wonder," snarled out Toadvine," that Mr. Mild-&#xD;
may did any thing of the kind. He's been in Connectictit&#xD;
so infarnally long, that I didn't believe he would do a fa-&#xD;
vor."&#xD;
"Why, what's turned your hair the wrong way this&#xD;
morning?" inquired Col. Price, with considerable in-&#xD;
terest.&#xD;
"Why, jist this," said Toadvine," "you ~see I've been&#xD;
overseer here too long to be interfered with by any man,&#xD;
and I won't stand it. Mister Mildmay can't teach me my&#xD;
business, and he shan't tell me I whip too much or too little.&#xD;
It's only yesterday he made me let Monday up, and I&#xD;
had'nt cut his hide in nary place!"&#xD;
"There is one thing that'll never do," said ~IYoL Price;&#xD;
"one thing 'II never do, and that i~, to let employers in-&#xD;
terfax too much in our business. My notion is, 'let me be&#xD;
head or tail, or nothing."'&#xD;
"Them's the way I think," half soliloquized Toadvine~&#xD;
drawing his' huge whiplash through his fingers; "them's&#xD;
the wayl think, and unless we do something to let these&#xD;
upstarts know Who's who, 'taint unlikely we may get down&#xD;
to be thought as little of-~s a schoolmaster or a preacher."&#xD;
"Not as bad as that I" said Col. Price, in a tone of&#xD;
voice that showed that he never thought that such a res-&#xD;
pectable office as overseer' could possibly be degraded hy&#xD;
connection with ~such professions; "no, no, not so ~'bad as&#xD;
that," and rousing himself up, lie. drove his fist into the&#xD;
table, and. looking around in ~4 great ezoitement, he said,&#xD;

126             THE MASTER~                                   j&#xD;
"he would like to see a living man that would. dare to mis-&#xD;
take him for a Behoolmaster or a preacher)'&#xD;
Toadvine, who bad, cruelty enough in his composition&#xD;
to make two Col. Prices, lacked that military gentleman's&#xD;
courage in 4he. expression of his sentiments; so he deeply&#xD;
regi~e'tted that he had made even the improbable compari-&#xD;
son that had given his friend offence, and getting up from&#xD;
his seat he went to a rude sideboard, and unlocking it, he&#xD;
took out a decanter of raw whiskey, and setting a broken&#xD;
tumbler and a teacup upon the table, he suggested to Col.&#xD;
Price the propriety of taking something to help out his&#xD;
breakfast."&#xD;
"That's very good liquor," said Price,, smacking his&#xD;
lips, "whar did you come across it?"&#xD;
"Well, don't you know it, easy," suggested Toadvine,&#xD;
putting t~ie decanter up to Price's nose, "don't you know&#xD;
the smell?"&#xD;
"Upon my word," 8aid' Price, drawing in his breath,&#xD;
as if inhaling the perfume of a moss rose, "upon my/word,&#xD;
old OTen~ Blathei~skite's 'electioneering t&amp;amp;ur,' as the central&#xD;
committee calledd it; bow did you. have so much? thought&#xD;
it all, went~at the 'Clay gut precinct.'"&#xD;
"Why, you see," said Toadvine, "I sent word to the&#xD;
General, that if he expected to get the~vote of this neigb-&#xD;
borhood, he had better send up a bar'1 of something to drink,&#xD;
and he 8ent word he'd do it; he said that the.' South was&#xD;
iwd~nger,' and he'd do any thing but bribe, to get to Con~&#xD;
gress. I sent after the bar'l the very morning of the~ day&#xD;
it was wanted, by lazy Jim, and would you believe it, the&#xD;
&#xD;
A TALE OF SOUTHERN LIFE.         12~(&#xD;
whiskey didn't get here till night," and Toadvine assumed&#xD;
a look of innocence and regret.&#xD;
"And so," said Price, helping himself to another glass,&#xD;
"you had the whole left on your hands?"&#xD;
"Nuthen else," chuckled Toadvine, and, as if unable&#xD;
to restrain himself longer, and either from the effect of the&#xD;
liquor, or the xemembrance of the trick he .played upon a&#xD;
candidate for Congress, he kicked his heels in the air and&#xD;
laughed until the tears came in his eyes.&#xD;
"But didn't~the General smell~ a rat? "~ inquired Price,&#xD;
in t~ deprecating voice, "didn't he find out how you fixed&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
"Not a bit of it," said Toadvine, "for I saw the Gen-&#xD;
eral coming down the road the next day, so I staked down&#xD;
lazy Jim by the side of the fence, and commenced on him&#xD;
jnst as the General rode up. The nigger hollered." Oh,&#xD;
lord, Massa Toadvin~, have mercy!' 'Yes,' said' ii, not&#xD;
noticing the General, 'I'll have~mercy, you'infernal scoun-&#xD;
drel, for delaying on the road yesterday with that whiskey.&#xD;
I'll teach you to fool away your time, when you are on Gen.&#xD;
Blatherskite's business."&#xD;
"'On whose business?' said the General, reining up&#xD;
'his horse, and looking astonished; 'are you flogging that&#xD;
nigger on my account, Mr. ~&#xD;
"'Yes, General,' said I, looking very angi~y, 'this&#xD;
nigger was sent for the whiskey, to treat your friends at&#xD;
"Clay gut," and he managed to get back after the votiz~g&#xD;
was over."'&#xD;
""Well, never mind!' said the General, 'just keep ~t&#xD;
to drink my health with 1' and he rode away; but whar was&#xD;

128            THE MASTER'S HOUSE                                                      A TALE OF SOUTHERN LIFE.        I~9&#xD;
&#xD;
the difference?" said Toadvine, speculatively; "you know,&#xD;
the General got 'the licker on tick, and he'd challenge any&#xD;
man that sent him ,a bill."&#xD;
At this point in the conversation, a tall, likely-looking&#xD;
negro was seen approaching the house, from the field; he&#xD;
carried his hoe jauntily across his~ shoulder. In coming&#xD;
into ~the surrounding enclosuree, he was obliged to pass&#xD;
through a gate, always ph~ced near The overseer's dwelling.&#xD;
"Whar yoi~t going?" said Toadvine; and springing&#xD;
into the yard, and whirling 'his whip over his head, he&#xD;
brought it down on the negro's back, simultaneous with his&#xD;
question, "whar you going, you black devil? did I not&#xD;
tell you to stay in the field?"&#xD;
"Master James," said the negro, with humility, mixed&#xD;
with astonishment, while still writhing under the pain of&#xD;
the blow; "I cum'd home because Mistress wanted I to&#xD;
clar up de yard, you knows I wouldn't leave de gang,&#xD;
'cept on permission."&#xD;
~ I knows nothing of the kind," sneered' Toadvine, in&#xD;
the negro's face ; "I know 'nothing, except that you are .a&#xD;
sneaking, skulking scoundrel; but I'll catch you, my man,-.-&#xD;
I'll catch you\! and by the ,if I get tL chance at&#xD;
your hide, I'll 'peel you cleaner than you ever did a pos-&#xD;
sum! now ~o and clear up the yard ; " and Toadvine struck&#xD;
at the boy again; but with surprising agility Jack avoided&#xD;
the blow, and ~disappeared.&#xD;
"There's 'insurrection for you," snarled out Toadvine,&#xD;
in a perfect fit of rage, at. the: same time storming up and&#xD;
'down' th~ yard; "there's a nigger that his master ~ay~ I&#xD;
&#xD;
mustn't whip, and he take0 advantage of it, t~ defy me to&#xD;
my face."&#xD;
Price looked on coolly, apparently ininterested; at&#xD;
any rate he expressed no surprise, but ~1et Toadvine ex-&#xD;
haust himself, in giving wordy expressions to~his feelings;&#xD;
and then, from a wild flower growing near by, with a well&#xD;
aimed mouthful of tobacco juice, he knocked a bumbk-be~&#xD;
on the ground, and spoke as foio'ws&#xD;
"Toadvine~ circumvent that nigger; just teach him&#xD;
yoa are a warmer friend to him than his master. ]~on't&#xD;
strike him, as y6u did just now, in anger, and without a&#xD;
cause,-have a rca~on, and then work at his hide, like a&#xD;
saw-mill."&#xD;
"But I can't get a reason," said Toadvine, groaning&#xD;
under his impotency; "he won't give me half a chance."&#xD;
"Well, make a chance," whined out the sapient 'Colo~.&#xD;
nel. "You know 'fore I come to Moreton's, I oversee for&#xD;

Berks, 'cut the fust 8tick on this yere plantation, and he&#xD;

130            THE MASrER's HousE;                                                     A TALE OF SOUTHERN LIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
old Berks wasn't to be sca~xed; but. it was jest done be-&#xD;
cause old Jeff could fool his master, and I know'd it; so&#xD;
things went on very well, until I couldn't sleep contented,&#xD;
until Ii took)a little conceit out of Jeff~; but for a reason.&#xD;
"One night we was weighing cotton, and up walked Big&#xD;
Bill, 4ithick~lipped scoundrel as there was on 'the place;&#xD;
he put his basket on the scales, and, by the hokey, it 'went&#xD;
over three hundred. 'Well done!' said old Berks~, in&#xD;
ecstasy, 'well~ done, Big ]3i11; and now,' said the old&#xD;
man, sort of funny like, 'as you have picked fifty pounds&#xD;
more than usual, you can call at the store roon~, and get a&#xD;
pah' of shoes.' Big Bill laughed-old J3erks laughed-.&#xD;
and I stuck my hand into the cotton basket, and lulled&#xD;
out two watermelons, weighing 'bout thirty-nine pounds.&#xD;
"At this," continued Price, rubbing hi~ hands in glee,&#xD;
and giving the poor bumble-bee another shower of tobacco&#xD;
juice, "at this~. old Berks, who was a 'little tight,' got&#xD;
into a~ passion; he swore such ungeaer6us and outrageous&#xD;
cond~tio~, on the part of his niggers, would break his heart,&#xD;
and if I didn't give Big Bill 'forty,' he would dismiss&#xD;
me from the pla~e, trnd administer the medb~ine himself~&#xD;
"So said I, pretending to be~ hurt with his severity,&#xD;
skid I, 'Captain Berks, then's family niggers.' 'I don't&#xD;
~e7' 'shouted the old man (the brandy, I think, getting the&#xD;
upper hand of 1~im); 'I don't care,, family or no family; a&#xD;
fellow~ that-would swindle on one side, and rob my melon&#xD;
pateli on. the other, shall be flogged, I'd tie up J~ff'thar,&#xD;
~nuoh~ as I think of him,' eaid~Berks, 'if he'd do s~x6h s~&#xD;
tbii~g~'. 'You would,' 'said I, pretending to be astoni4e&amp;amp;f&#xD;
'Ye~I would,' said old Berks, towering; if yQu~4~.&#xD;
I                                   V&#xD;
&#xD;
catch Jeff trying to palm off a water-melon for seed-cotton,&#xD;
give him forty.'"&#xD;
As 'Price concluded this interesting story, he delibe-&#xD;
rately walked past Toadvine, who was st~xidiii'g, a perfe~~t&#xD;
monument of mystified surprise, and, moun1~ing his horse,&#xD;
appeared as if he wa~ thus unceremoniously going ~o ride&#xD;
away.&#xD;
"And what about Jeff?" finally asked the perplexed&#xD;
and rather dull overseer.&#xD;
'F Oh nothing," replied Price, carelessly, "only the&#xD;
next night, thar was a water melon 'in Jeff's basket, and&#xD;
every nigger on the placesee'd it, and he was given 'forty,'&#xD;
and I think it tuck him six weeks to get out of tue hos-&#xD;
pitaL"&#xD;
Toadvine, as he watched the retreating form of his&#xD;
friend, Colonel Price, seemed suddenly inspired with unu-&#xD;
sual spirits; he cracked his whip in scientific flourishes,&#xD;
and going into hi~ 'cabin, he stuck a loaded pistol in his'&#xD;
belt, took a drink of whiskey, locked up the' deca~rter,&#xD;
and remarking, "'that Colonel 'Price is smart, and that&#xD;
watermelon trick was beautiful," he ~nounted his shaggy&#xD;
pony, and was soon lost in the distance, as he rode to-&#xD;
wards the slave gang, at work in the field.'&#xD;
As Col. Price reached the main road on his way home~&#xD;
he came ~'p with 'a small, sandy-faced, lig~t4iaired man,&#xD;
mounted on a "'creole pony," and -followed, by live or six&#xD;
fierce-looking hounds; a double.~bat ' ,,' gun was balanced&#xD;
before ~him, and he' catri~d- in his I~4n4 a raw-hide whi~&#xD;

"Just nosing about," said Stubbs, whipping, off 'one&#xD;
or two' dogs,'~~ ~ould oceasioxiahly show thejr teeth at&#xD;
Col. Price's nether limbs.&#xD;
"Who's got any triggers out, now?" continued the&#xD;
Colonel, fQr he took a great interesting Stubbs's occupation.&#xD;
"Enough out," replied Stubt~s,, "but no 'rangement&#xD;
,made for catching 'em.' I'nl done;1' he continued, "a fetch-&#xD;
ing runaways home, just for jail fees; 'twont keep up my&#xD;

"That's right, ~tubbs!" said the Colonel, looking Rp.&#xD;
provingly on. his friend ~ "that's right ~ if these rich&#xD;
planters won't 'antee up,' dont help 'em, that's my notion;&#xD;
but who's that ahead" asked Pine, as he discovered a&#xD;
young person' on horseback, waiting in the road.&#xD;
"That~s young Finch," said Stubbs~ without showing&#xD;
~ny 0u~~e; "that boy," he continued, "does take more&#xD;
juterest in a nigger hunt than my dogs' do, and he's just&#xD;
waiting thar, until I come up, in hopes that he can see a&#xD;

Price axid .8tubbs 'shook hands with 'Finch, a youth&#xD;
perhaps of fourteen, who "was armed not only with a gun,&#xD;
~hut had a bowie knife sticking ostentatiously out of his&#xD;
)~reast., A. little general 'conversation ensued, when ~Stubbe&#xD;
and Finch, opening a plantation gate, bade Col. Price&#xD;
~ ~"~9Od day,'~ and commenced. trotting through the" cotton&#xD;
*~w8" t~w~.tds the 'dark cypress swamps, that loomed ~p,&#xD;
'W~ m~un~ains in the distance.&#xD;
"~U4 what do you think, Stubbs, will be our chance&#xD;
&#xD;

Finch, at the"same time impatiently urging on his horse.&#xD;
"Bad, very~ bad," said Stiibbs; "n~*~e is out in this&#xD;
range now, but Busteed's old Phil; ~the fa~t 'is," said&#xD;
Stubbs, reining up ~As horse, "my' dogs has got such a&#xD;
scear on the idggers now, that they won~t run aws~y,-the&#xD;
overseer has only to say, 'Now boys, if I e~tch any~of you'&#xD;
leavin' you'll have Stubbs' dogs after you,' and that ends&#xD;
the thing. I ought to get a big price for doing that," sug-&#xD;
gested Stubbs, conscious that he was the victim of unre-&#xD;
warded merit.&#xD;
"And how didjou know, Stubbs, that old 'Phil was in&#xD;
the brake?" inquired the yoimg man.&#xD;
"'Cause I saw 'him yesterday, while 'still hunting;'&#xD;
come right on him, tiirtied up on his back, sound asleep."&#xD;
"And why.didn't you make him go hopie?'~ asked'the&#xD;

had failed; and he was afraid that Finch would get: an&#xD;
idea that such was not the case; so he assumed a 'f~n~liar&#xD;
air, and explained himself as follows&#xD;
"You' see, Oharley, I was &amp;amp; 'still-hunting,' as I said,&#xD;
and looking for deer, and in wading Turtk 'O~ekfor I was&#xD;

him, he'll run straight home, sound as a, nut, and no harm&#xD;
done to anybody."&#xD;
"That was very considerate," said young master Finch,&#xD;
evidently much flattered by Stubbs' -manner; "it was very&#xD;
considerate indeed, and I think 'Busteed should be vary&#xD;
much obliged to you."&#xD;
"To be sure he should!" echoed Stubbs, "and all&#xD;
the planters 'should; why, air, but for me, -the swamps&#xD;
would be as full of niggers as they is of wild hogs. I&#xD;
badly paid for my services, Mr. Finch, considering' I h~ye'&#xD;
to feed my own dogs, and take the risks I run."&#xD;
"And' what risks do you run ?" inquired young. Finch,&#xD;
carelessly patting his spirited little horse on the neck, and&#xD;
giving his -gun a juster. balance, as it rested before him on&#xD;
the pommel of the saddle.&#xD;
"Why, a heap of ri8ks," said Stubbs, with the air of&#xD;
an inj~ired man; "do you suppose that the niggers can be&#xD;
tuck, aud'-iiothing to do but say, 'If you please, Mr. Darkee,&#xD;
youm~ master Wants you hum?' Oh, no!- I've known&#xD;
shooting -and slashing going on afore now, that would hurt&#xD;
any.man'sfeelins." -&#xD;
"And "where was - that ?" inquired young Finch, with&#xD;
greedy interest.&#xD;
"Why you see," said Stubbs, - "that two or three&#xD;
years agone, old Duckeye, that's a preacher now, and Bill&#xD;
Bla~s as was, afore ho died, both kept dogs~-well, once&#xD;
they-were out huntia?, and 'it seems their packs closed, in&#xD;
~ the same nigger,-I'm, told that their cry was beauti-&#xD;
~u1, w~n, as they say at ca~mp-meetin', they met, and' jined&#xD;
their Voices in harmoni&amp;amp;us song; but Blas~'s hounds had&#xD;
&#xD;
the heels; they was of the old -' Ryder stock,' -and they&#xD;
lust rut over Diickeyes dogs, and left them in the rear.&#xD;
I think the nigger they was arter belonged ~to old Gray;&#xD;
he could scratch gravel, that -nigger,. and double, and turn,&#xD;
like any fox,-the chase was beailtifnl. Now, as might be&#xD;
supposed, Blass's pack drew the fust blood, and -had the&#xD;
nigger down, when Dackeye's dogs come up.&#xD;
"The row was tremendous, and they would have sent&#xD;
the nigger to kingdom cum, if the dogs, being strangers,&#xD;
had not got to fighting among themselves. There was a&#xD;
hnllaboloo, sure enough; I was on the spot the next day,&#xD;
and the palmetto was smoothed down for a half acre, whar&#xD;
the fight was. While the dogs was going it -among them-&#xD;
selves, and the darkee was crying and yelling, old Duckeye&#xD;
and ]3lass got to quarreling about who caught the nigger;&#xD;
Blass contending , as was right, that as his dogs -gin the&#xD;
first grab, the nigger was his. IDuckey~ stuck out ~thaV-his&#xD;
dogs was fust to find the trail, so th~e- nigger was l~is,-~and&#xD;
so they got to swearing and scrimmaging,' and tucking in-&#xD;
to each other their bodies, and yelling and cursing, the&#xD;
the dogs fell on 'em both, and suoh a row ensued as never&#xD;
was afore.&#xD;
~C In this beautiful difficulty, the nigger got clean off,&#xD;
and iBlass got sto bbed in the side, and died that 'ere&#xD;
very night; and so you. see, Mr. Finch, that the infernal&#xD;
runaways is dangerous. I often think of Blass!" said.&#xD;
Stubbs, mournfully, "for you see," wiping his eyes with hi&amp;amp;&#xD;
coat sleeve, "that that 'ere dog thar, with the blood4hot&#xD;
eyes, was own nephy to .Bla~ss's Cuba, raised and imported,&#xD;
Santy Christy, as Blass called him."&#xD;

"Well, that ~was surprising," said young Finch, look-&#xD;
ing with admiration at the dog, that had such a disti~-&#xD;
guished uncle; and at the ~ame time somewhat confouiided&#xD;
by the eQuglomeration of Stubbs' story; "~but how was&#xD;
it," he inquired, " that Duckeye ~got off from the ~&#xD;
and Finch hesitated to give a name to the deed pictured&#xD;
in his~ mind.&#xD;
".~.-.--- the stabbing," said Stubl~s. Fin&amp;amp;h nodded yes&#xD;
to the suggestion, and Stubbs went on-" you see the&#xD;
grand jury had Thickeye up, ~two or three times, but whar&#xD;
was the witnesses; it was a gin the law to use the dogs and&#xD;
the niggers to swar agil a white man in court, so the mat-&#xD;

Ai~ this moment the two horsemen and their canine&#xD;
followers entered the thick woods, and in course of the&#xD;
fleeting hQur, Busteed's old Phil was roused from his lair,&#xD;
and there were to be heard the sharp ringing notes of the&#xD;
open-mouthed pack, as they engaged in "the spirit stirring&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
TILE PROMISflD Vl5flr.&#xD;
MILDJ~TAY and Annie set out for Mr. Mo'reton's, soon after&#xD;
breakfast; the day was so fine, that it was agreed that the&#xD;
journey should be made on horseback, and that on the way,&#xD;
Annie should ride through the plantation, and gratify her&#xD;
wishes at the sight of her husband's luxuriai~t fields.&#xD;
At the time of starting, ~he1 little negroes,~who had&#xD;
come in from "the quarters, '~ arranged themselves in a&#xD;
row along the avenue of the lawn, and as Annie passed,&#xD;
they bo'~red their comical-looking 1i~ads, atid said, " d~oo'&#xD;
by, Mistress!" "Goo' by, Master!" and then, as if over-&#xD;
come with their familiarity, they gave a universal laugh,&#xD;
and went trooping off behind th~ house, Ponce.. de Leon,&#xD;
With a half malicious, and half mischievous spirit, knock-&#xD;
ing a majority of them over on the green award, by join.&#xD;
ing in the scramble.&#xD;
Meanwhile Governor had opened the gate, and MiId~&#xD;
may and 'Annie passed through, and pursued their way&#xD;
down ~the road, the servant following at a respeetfiil dis-&#xD;

138             THE MASTER'S EOUSE                                                    A TALE OF SOUTHERN LIFE,         139&#xD;
&#xD;
tance in the rear. Scarcely had this been accomplished,&#xD;
before Ponce de Leon, having finished his gambola with&#xD;
the negro children, discovered the cavalcade moving away&#xD;
without him. With a rush that would have done honor to&#xD;
a race-horse, he- sped across the lawn, and fairly flew over&#xD;
the palings, and in another moment, was barking - and co-&#xD;
quetting around Annie's horse.&#xD;
"I will be more careful hereafter, Ponce," said Annie,&#xD;
laughing, and glancing at her favorite, "how I let you&#xD;
into my secrets; - for, do you know," she said, looking at&#xD;
Mildmay, "that I believe some dogs have the quality of&#xD;
intelligence."&#xD;
"Thqre cannot be a doubt of it," he returned, interest.&#xD;
ed with the suggestion, "and there is nothing to disprove&#xD;
that they may not even have a future, though still humble&#xD;
existence."          -&#xD;
"You have improved, Graham, amazingly, upon my&#xD;
speculation~," said Aniriie gayly.&#xD;
"Perhaps so, but you will admit that there is some-&#xD;
thing truly poetical in the- wild dream of the American&#xD;
aborigine~ where he spiritualizes his future existence; no&#xD;
heathen mythology has-given us a pi.wet and more attrac-&#xD;
tive picture than the Indian and his- dog, side by side, in&#xD;
the happy hunting-grounds. ". - -&#xD;
"True, very true," returned Annie, "and more's the pity,&#xD;
that so noble a race could not be preserved by civiliza-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"Piiy indeed, but it is impossible to preserve~. the. In-&#xD;
dian. - In the wild woods, ~nd away from artificial influen-&#xD;
ces, he flourishes like these mighty forest trees, through&#xD;
&#xD;
which we wind our way; -but like these trees, if trai~splant-&#xD;
ed or disturbed by cultivation, iri~ist wither away."&#xD;
"It's a sad picture," said Anni% thoughtfully;~~ "but,"&#xD;
she add4d, "I like their consistency after all, for with the&#xD;
Indian it is indeed~' liberty or death."'&#xD;
"Hurrah,-" said Mildmay, with playful exultation, "hur-&#xD;
rah for Annie Hastings! who, though so little,, is so very&#xD;
brave; she will yet be the mother of heroes." - - -&#xD;
"I will beat you in a fair race to the field gate," said&#xD;
Annie, blushing, and pushing her heretofore lingering pal-&#xD;
frey into a gallop, - away she sped, Mildmay gallantly fob&#xD;
lowing just in the rear, with Ponce de Leon, crazy with&#xD;
excitement, far in the van.&#xD;
As the eques~r-ians came up to the inclosure, Jack, who&#xD;
had seen them approaching, was at the gate to bpen it, ~and&#xD;
as the party passed in, he gave them a salute oI~i genuine&#xD;
feeling, which Annie said "was delightful to behold.~&#xD;
"You can shut up -de gate yous~f," said Jack, as Gov-&#xD;
ernor, with an air intended to-be much more impressive than&#xD;
his master's, was about riding on, heedingg his sable&#xD;
fellow'sexvant.&#xD;
"Oh sartin," said Governor, wheeling round his, pony,-&#xD;
and giving the gate a swing that sent it to with a er~ish; -&#xD;
and then turning to Ja~ck a look of assumed contempt, he&#xD;
remarked :-         -&#xD;
-" Some indiwiduals don't- suppose that field darkies can&#xD;
learn to open and shut a gate at de same time,.-it would-&#xD;
be too much for dis world," and Governor was so -delighted&#xD;
with his own wit, that he) nearly fell off 'of MB horse from&#xD;
laughing.                       -~&#xD;

"Mabe'e not," said Jack, seizing his hoe and working&#xD;
away furiously in the soft ground,; "mabee not," he repeat-&#xD;
ed~ h15 face brightening' into a broad grin, and then without&#xD;
any conceivable reason, except an exuberance of ~tiimal&#xD;
spirits, lie broke intQ a guffaw, not oniy louder than O-over-&#xD;
nor's explosion, but so terrific, that it Set the crows flying at&#xD;
l~he time high over head, cawing~'with alarm.&#xD;
At this moment a little negress passed by with a pail&#xD;
of water on her head, which she was carrying to the gang&#xD;
in the field. Mildmay filled the gourd that was floating on&#xD;
the top, and offered it to Annie, which she playfully refused.&#xD;
".1 see, Annie," said Mildmay, most 'liberally helping&#xD;
himself "that you cannot get aecustome&amp;amp; to a gourd,.-&#xD;
but, according to my ideas, it is the only'goblet that truly&#xD;
accords in simplicity with'the gently gurgling spring."&#xD;
* The sun, as~ it rose higher in the heavens, began to&#xD;
pour down with intensity, and Mildmay, perceiving that&#xD;
Annie' was suffering from the~ heat, suggested more rapid&#xD;
prQgress, and the 1~wo struck into a "lope," which was con~.&#xD;
tinted for 'a. long distance without interruption.&#xD;
Up9~ reaching their destination, it was a grateful re-&#xD;
lief to receive the protecting shade of 'the heavy walls and&#xD;
~Arerhanging verandalis of the mansion.&#xD;
Mrs. Moreton met Annie with unusual pleasure mark-&#xD;
edupon her face, and' Aunt Margaret was so delighted,&#xD;
that 'she not only shook both her hands ~ffectionately, but&#xD;
kiis~ed her on her cheek.&#xD;
The chIldren, with their 'nurse's,' presented th~m~elves&#xD;
one after another, and it seemed to Anniein the confusion,&#xD;

&#xD;
that a child and a negro were so strangely identifle4, that&#xD;
it' waS difficult to imagine them apart.&#xD;
"Let us have sqme water liere," said Mr. Moreton,&#xD;
looking about generally, after. himself and Mildmay had&#xD;
seated themselves, and' the ladies had retired to a distant&#xD;
part of the house.&#xD;
Now Mildmay was exceedingly thirsty, and so appear-&#xD;
ed Mr. Moreton; but although there were great num-&#xD;
bers of negroes moving about the premises, presenting&#xD;
themselves and then disappearing like puppets ~in a show,&#xD;
still no water came. Finally Mr. Moreton lost all patience,&#xD;
and with a loud voice cried out:&#xD;
"John~David-M'ary-.-~.Jefferson-~Wash, why don't&#xD;
somebody bring some water here?"&#xD;
Still the negroes moved about, as if unconscious -of&#xD;
hearing any order, and Mr. Moreton jumped np, and was&#xD;
about getting into a passion, when Aunt Margaret met him&#xD;
at the door, and in a mild ~voice sa5d&#xD;
"Brother, did' I hear you. call?"&#xD;
"Certainly you did," said 'Mr. Moreton, sitting back&#xD;
in his chair nearly exhausted.&#xD;
Aunt Margaret singled out one of the many ~idlers in&#xD;
view, and gave the required directions, and almost instant-&#xD;
ly she was obeyed.'&#xD;
"I forgot tG ask you, Mr. Mildmay" said Moreton, tak-&#xD;
ing up his glass, "I forgot to ask 'if you would have any&#xD;
thing with your water. I have myself so hng given up the&#xD;
habit of indulging in any thi~ig 'strong,' with the temperate&#xD;
exception of occasionally at dinner, that I fear I have ap-&#xD;
peared regardless' of the rites of hospitality."&#xD;

I gratify, but 'beyond thaV, I a~n careful not '~to tax my&#xD;
strength by unnecessary stimulants."&#xD;
I' ~Bring some cigars ~here," cried Mr. Moreton' from&#xD;
hatit, and then catching the eye of the servant holding the&#xD;
salver and pitcher, he said:&#xD;
"Viney, bring those cigars here, from oft' the parlor&#xD;
manteLpiece. -&#xD;
The girl obeyed, and presented Mildmay with the box,&#xD;
but he dqolined smoking for the, time being, and the two&#xD;
gentlemen again seating themselves, seemed disposed to&#xD;
enter. upon conversation,- as persons who had a great deal&#xD;
to say, and~ more than sttffieie~it time ti say it in.&#xD;
Annie was shown to a room splendid in. size, in the cen-&#xD;
tre of. which was an enormous French bedstead, -and on the&#xD;
side the familiar armoire. A tidy-looking, 'petted ~servant&#xD;
stood at her elbow, ready. to do her slightest bidding.&#xD;
Laying aside a coquettish sun-bonnet, which she preferred&#xD;
to use in the middle of the day, when out on horse-&#xD;
back, to 'the more showy riding cap that Mildmay had&#xD;
provided her with, she sat down in a comfortablechair, and&#xD;
submitted to the ordealof ~xaminatk~n from the distended&#xD;
eyes of ~her sable attendant.&#xD;
"What's your name?" said Annie to the girl, tore-&#xD;
lien her-self from the embarrassment of being an object of&#xD;
so much undisguised interest.&#xD;
"My. name i~ Violet,, Missus."&#xD;

At this moment the door of the room opened and Aunt&#xD;

"Certainly," said Mrs. Moreton, and she added, "Clo-&#xD;

she continued~, "clothe all our hands in homespun; it' is&#xD;

hung over the door a little girl, cqing out, "Where's&#xD;

and. runnii~g~against table and chairs, she came to a stand&#xD;
still, direotiy opposite where Annie was ~sitting.&#xD;
"Why, Toots,'? 'said Aunt Margaret to 'the child,&#xD;

"Down to the ~cotton-gin,-...-see all the corn'milI,' and&#xD;

"Do" take that little minz out of the room, 'Minnie,"&#xD;
said Mrs.VMoretdn, looking at one of the negroigirl8 near&#xD;
her; "for that 4ild' always sets ~e crazy With, her noise."&#xD;
"Toots wou't~et any body crazy with i~er ~noise,-she&#xD;
&#xD;
will be a go64 girl, and be 'till~-.not do nossin at ali7~"&#xD;
and having delivered herself of this speech, Toots com-&#xD;
menced dancing up and down, singing with a loud voice,&#xD;
each time her little feet struck on the floor.&#xD;
It was very plain that Aunt Margaret was delighted,&#xD;
and as Toots for a moment was still, she said,&#xD;
"Go and shake hands with Mrs. Mildmay, Toots."&#xD;
The little perpetual-motion eyed Annie for a moment&#xD;
with amusing interest, and then with the quickness of&#xD;
thought rushed forward, jumped into Annie's l&amp;amp;p, threw&#xD;
her arms round her neck, and said,&#xD;
"how you get such curls all down your face ?-.how you&#xD;
come to our house ?-how much you love Toots?" and&#xD;
the little thing clapped her hands and laughed, and crowed&#xD;
in a perfect ecstasy of delight.&#xD;
"Why," said Annie, overcome with astonishment and&#xD;
gratified surprise, "does this child go on this way all&#xD;
the time ?"&#xD;
"Yes, all the time," said Mrs. Moreton, dwelling~ on&#xD;
the all; "and I believe she is never still, even when&#xD;
asleep."&#xD;
"Toots very 'till," said the child with much solein-&#xD;
nity; and she then broke out a loud chirrup, as follows.&#xD;
"If I had a vife and, she had a baby,&#xD;
Yif~'s name ~Kitty, child's name Gavy."&#xD;
"Davy," said Aunt I~argaret, her eyes sparkling with&#xD;

"Why," said. Annie, wiping tears from her eyes,&#xD;
"Mrs. Moreton, you are indeed to be pitied, for I think&#xD;
Toots would even kill me."&#xD;
"I'll go and see that that dear child has something t~&#xD;
eat," said Aunt Margaret, leaving the room; and upon going&#xD;
down stairs, she found Toots running across the lawn,&#xD;
with a piece of poundcake in one hand, and a stick in the&#xD;
other, chasing a large numb r of awkward goslings head-&#xD;
over-heels before her.&#xD;
&#xD;
"~ Vife's name Kitty, and child's name Davy Goose,"&#xD;

head back on Annie's shoulder.&#xD;
"Minnie, take Toots out in the yard, I say," said Mrs.&#xD;
Moreton, putting her hand to her forehead, as if suffering&#xD;
from a severe pain in the head.&#xD;
"No, Minnie shan't take Toots," said the child, spring-&#xD;
ing from Annie's lap, and running to Aunt Margaret;&#xD;
"Toots set dog on Minnie, and Pa'll give Minnie 'forty,'&#xD;
-and then Toots broke out into an unintelligible song,&#xD;
mingled with imitations of all the noises heard in the&#xD;
poultry-yard; and finding that her mother was really get-&#xD;
ting serious, she suddenly calmed down, and walking up to&#xD;
one of the negro girls that was at work on the capote, she&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"Toots want needlers,-Toots show;" and having&#xD;
been accommodaLed with a needle and thread, she went&#xD;
through the pantomime of biting off the end of the thread,&#xD;
making a knot, and looking seriously at every one about&#xD;
her; b~it finding it impossible to remain quiet, she com-&#xD;

within an inch of seizing her dress, she glided away, and&#xD;
was heard paddling down stairs, laughing, hallooing, at&#xD;
the, as she supposed, really ineffectual attempts of one of&#xD;
the servants to arrest her progress.&#xD;
Annie was so amused at Toots, that, in spite of her-&#xD;

A TALE OF SOUTHERN LIFE~&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
EvERY-DAY INCIDENT.&#xD;
ALTHOUGH Moreton and Mildmay had frequently met at&#xD;
]3eechland, and on the highway, they really were but little&#xD;
acquainted with each other. Mr. Moreton was cere-&#xD;
monious when out of his own house, and Mildmay had&#xD;
found constant occupation on his plantation; and, with&#xD;
Annie's society, had no particular inducement to go&#xD;
abroad,-so, although Mr. Moreton and Mildmay sat&#xD;
down together with the mutual idea Qf being pleased with&#xD;
each other's society, yet it was nevertheless true, that the&#xD;
emotions of sympathy were yet to be called forth by the&#xD;
interchange of harmonious thoughts.&#xD;
A few moments' conversation only had taken place&#xD;
before Mr. Moreton and Mildmay, to their own astonish-&#xD;
ment, found that they differed on every interchange of&#xD;
sentiment; and as Mr. Moreton, living as he did in a&#xD;
somewhat solitary place, had, by long association with his&#xD;
negroes, become, insensibly to himself restive under con-&#xD;
tradiction, although respectfully offered, and from one he&#xD;
~ekuowledged an equal; still his abruptness of manner at&#xD;
&#xD;
first caused Mildmay to yield in silence, and then to differ&#xD;
from Mr. Moreton even beyond the natural bent of his&#xD;
true feelings.&#xD;
"I think that this custom that prevails with some&#xD;
Southern people of sending their children to the North to&#xD;
be educated is decidedly wrong, and very ridiculous," said&#xD;
Mr. Moreton, with great emphasis of~ maimer.&#xD;
"I must beg to differ with you again," said Mildmay,&#xD;
quietly, "for I have found not only the Northern colleges&#xD;
excellent as literary institutions, but useful, in giving the&#xD;
collateral advantage of acquaintance with the social and&#xD;
commercial character of our brethren of the whole Union."&#xD;
"I don't see the advantage, you speak of," returned&#xD;
Moreton, energetically; "we send our young men ~on to&#xD;
the North, and they come back with their heads crammed&#xD;
full of literary trash, and Southern institutions are made&#xD;
distasteful to them: I think it ruins them altogether."&#xD;
"I haven't found such to be my experience," said Mild-&#xD;
may, for the instant annoyed.&#xD;
"I beg your pardon, sir," said Moreton, slightly color-&#xD;
ing; "but the fact is, I forgot, in my knowledge of your&#xD;
Southern birth and interests, that you had ever seen the&#xD;
North;. so you must excuse me, for I don't in my own&#xD;
mind identify you with the Yankees."&#xD;
"But I have shown great willingness myself' to be&#xD;
identified with them," said Mildmay, laughing; "for," he&#xD;
continued, "the best half of me is the very pith of the&#xD;
Mayflower stock."&#xD;
"Tru?, true," said Mr. Moreton, his natural gallantry&#xD;
getting the better of hi~ prejudices; "and I wish such rare&#xD;

&#xD;
infusions were more frecluent: but you will admit, my&#xD;
dear Mildmay," continued he, after a pauses "that the&#xD;
tendency of Northern colleges are anti-Southern in their&#xD;
influence."&#xD;
"Not necessarily so," said Mildmay, with decision&#xD;
"for," he continued, "out of three hundred students I&#xD;
wa~ associated with at Maiden, most of whom were Yan-&#xD;
kees, and to the manner born, there were but two avowed&#xD;
abolitionists; and what is most remarkable, one of' those&#xD;
insanities is now an editor of a secession paper in South&#xD;
Carolina, and the other a school teacher in Georgia, pub-&#xD;
lishing addresses cautioning the planters of the South&#xD;
against using New England primers, lest they get uncon-&#xD;
sciously infected with abolitionn sentiments in spelling Eng-&#xD;
lish words."&#xD;
"Well, there," said Moreton, whirling around upon his&#xD;
chair and snapping his fingers in triumph, "don't you see,&#xD;
Mr. Mildmay, by your own showing, something contemp-&#xD;
tible in the ," and Moreton stopped.&#xD;
"You were going to say, 'New England character,'"&#xD;
suggested Mildmay, smiling; "but, I see nothing of the&#xD;
kind in my illustration, and these two young men that I&#xD;
speak of, are mere time-servers. They thought that anti-&#xD;
slavery sentiments would help their personal interests in&#xD;
Connecticut, and so they adopted them. Finishing their&#xD;
education, they went South, and, always consistent, they&#xD;
fatter the pro-slavery feeling among us, and are as heart-&#xD;
less and unprincipled and dangerous in their new vocation,&#xD;
as they were in their old; and," continued Mildmay, his&#xD;
eyes flashing fire," I loathe and despise such cowardly&#xD;
&#xD;
creatures; they are a disgrace when compared with the&#xD;
lowest standards of man."&#xD;
"I never had any other feeling for them;" said Mr.&#xD;
Moreton, with complacency.&#xD;
"You will pardon me, sir," said Mildmay, "if I say, that&#xD;
this truckling to interest, this sacrifice of conscience and&#xD;
truth, is not peculiar to New England, or New England&#xD;
men. I think I meet parallel examples sometimes in my&#xD;
visits to Beechiand. I see hypocrites at our doors, for I mis-&#xD;
trust the sincerity of all men, who, owning no negroes them-&#xD;
selves, are violent in defence of our peculiar institutions."&#xD;
"I never took that view of it," said Moreton, rising, and&#xD;
walking rapidly up and down the gallery; "perhaps you&#xD;
are right."&#xD;
"I know that Ii am right," said Mildrnay; "look," he&#xD;
continued, "at the burnings and lynching of negroes,&#xD;
which have disgraced the fair fame of the South, and it&#xD;
will be found that the planters, the men of wealth and&#xD;
education, have rarely been participators-.the deeds were&#xD;
done by irresponsible men, who owned no negroes them~&#xD;
selves, but who thus gratified their unholy passions, through&#xD;
the corrupt idea, that their excessive zeal gave evidence of&#xD;
devotion to Southern interests."&#xD;
"Mildmay, I believe that what you sayis true,'~ said&#xD;
Moreton, stopping in his walk, and falling into a brown&#xD;
study, and then thrown off his guard by Mildmay's impres-&#xD;
siveness-.---.--" Now, I remember, in the 1~Xurrell excitement,&#xD;
we tried an incendiary at Beechla~nd, and Judge Lynch&#xD;
sentenced him to be hung~ But when -the poor fellow was&#xD;
on the gallows, no one would aot as Jack Ketch, and the&#xD;

&#xD;
'poor devil would have got off, had not a Btranger in, the&#xD;
place, and himself suspected of abolition~ sentiments, ad-&#xD;
justed the rope, and launched the victim into eternity."&#xD;
"And, by this murder, the suspected individual ap-&#xD;
peased the public sentiment against himself," said Mildmay,&#xD;
with emotion.&#xD;
"Oh yes," said Mr. IVXoreton, as if relieved from an&#xD;
oppressive feeling,-" oh yes, and the man has lived in&#xD;
Beechland ever since."&#xD;
"And would hang us to-morrow," said Mildmay, with&#xD;
disgust, "if the insurrection were against us. Upon such&#xD;
wretched social materials, upon such a moral volcano, do&#xD;
we slaveholders exist."&#xD;
As Mildmay concluded, Mr. Moreton absolutely fell&#xD;
into his chair. Strange ideas had been awakened in his&#xD;
mind,-thoughts that had slumbered 'for years, aroused. A&#xD;
sort of desolate feeling came over him, the future looked&#xD;
gloomy and uncertain, and for a moment he mentally groped&#xD;
in darkness,~.-and then, brushing his hand across his brow,&#xD;
he said:&#xD;
"Mildmay, if we would happily live in the South,&#xD;
we must not look so deeply and darkly upon the things&#xD;
around us;" and with this remark, Mr. Moreton's thoughts&#xD;
launched again into the current of life~ allowing the present&#xD;
o~ily to occupy hi~ mind the future he carefully excluded.&#xD;
Fortunately, to relieve both gentlemen of their embar-&#xD;
rassment, Col. Lee, the only person invited to dine with&#xD;
the Moretons, on Mildmay's visit, was seen riding toward&#xD;
the house; and by this exclusive, invitation Mr. Moreton&#xD;
intended to show' Mildmay the 'high esteem he, placed&#xD;
&#xD;
upon his visit, for Col. Lee was presumed only to honor with&#xD;
his company people ~f admitted pretensions, for he claimed&#xD;
for himself, to be one' of the "first families of Virginia,"&#xD;
and consequently was aristocratic to the last degree. -&#xD;
The moment that Moreton caught sight of the Colonel,&#xD;
he walked out upon the lawn and met that gentleman half&#xD;
way, and accompanied him into the house. The Colonel&#xD;
had evidently determined to make an impression. He sa-&#xD;
luted Mildmay with a courteous dignity, such as Washing-&#xD;
ton may have been presumed to use on great state occa-&#xD;
sions, and before he had well seated himself, a servant was&#xD;
already by his side, with a salver containing li~~ueurs, and&#xD;
a pitcher of cool water.&#xD;
Col. Lee helped himself to a glass of wine, and turning&#xD;
to Moreton and Mildmay, he expressed his pleasure at seeing&#xD;
them both looking so well, trusted that the ladies were m&#xD;
good health, and that Mrs. Mildmay found the climate of&#xD;
Louisiana to agree with her constitution; and, tossing oft'&#xD;
his wine, he remarked complacently,&#xD;
~C Moreton, you have the most excellent water on your&#xD;
place. I know of none so good in the neighborhood. It is a&#xD;
great blessing to have good water," and thereupon the&#xD;
Colonel begged to be excused, as he was quite thirsty&#xD;
from riding in the dust, and he helped himself again to the&#xD;
sherry1 and then seated himself in an elegant attitude,&#xD;
and seemed to be prepared to receive admiration of his&#xD;
personal appearance, and to listen patiently to hear any re-&#xD;
marks that might be made in conversation.&#xD;
The moment that Col. Lee took his seat, Mr. Moreton&#xD;
brightened up, and a lively conversation ensued, in which&#xD;

&#xD;
Mildmay became interested, from the novelty of the ideas&#xD;
constantly presented, although they were not always in&#xD;
accordance with his manner of thinking.&#xD;
As Mr. Moreton had a large family, the si~bject of&#xD;
education. was a source of constant reflection; and as&#xD;
the exchange of ideas progressed, Mr. Moreton, unintention-&#xD;
ally to himself, made some of his favorite remarks against&#xD;
Northern institutions of learning, when Colonel Lee, per-&#xD;
ceiving that Mildmay had differed with Moreton on their&#xD;
merits, broke out into a eulogistic defence of Southern&#xD;
Colleges, and wound tip by a graphic description of the&#xD;
"Virginia University," an institution, he said, that was the&#xD;
fountain of chivalry, of profound scholarship, and statesman-&#xD;
ship; and gradually progressing, lie gave many anecdotes of&#xD;
~the amusements of the students, and described with inim-&#xD;
itable humor, a cock-fight, that took place one evening&#xD;
in "the chapel," in which one of the professors lost to him&#xD;
N&#xD;
nearly a half gallon of brandy, besides a box of the best&#xD;
Spanish cigars.&#xD;
Mrs. Moreton had scarcely gone through the pantomime&#xD;
of showing Annie, rather than telling her, how very dis-&#xD;
tracting Toots' noise was to her head, when a negro pre-&#xD;
sented herself at Mrs. Moreton's door, and, making a low&#xD;
courtesy, said:&#xD;
"Mistress, Aunt Dinah's. done got worse."&#xD;
"One of your servants sick?" said Annie.&#xD;
"Yns," replied Mrs. Moreton, putting on a light shawl,&#xD;
"one of our most valuable women has had 'the fever,' and&#xD;
it seems impossible to break it," and as Mrs. Moreton said&#xD;
this she opened an armoire door, and after fumbling among&#xD;
&#xD;
various vials and papers, she took something in her hand,&#xD;
and excusing herself to Annie, was about to leave the room,&#xD;
when she turned and said: "Mrs. Mildmay, perhaps you&#xD;
would like to walk down to the quarters with me."&#xD;
Annie at the instant hearing the voice of her husband&#xD;
and Mr. Moreton on the front gallery, as if engaged in an&#xD;
interesting conversation, at once assented, and at Mrs.&#xD;
Moreton's suggestion, put on a large sun-bonnet that was&#xD;
lying near by in a chair. Thus equipped, she and Mrs.&#xD;
Moreton proceeded down stairs and passed into thQ yard&#xD;
back of the house, a number of little negroes instantly pre-&#xD;
senting themselves, who ran ahead and opened the garden&#xD;
gates.&#xD;
The buildings occupied by Mr. Moreton's negroes, were&#xD;
quite a feature of his plantation. When he first moved&#xD;
upon it, he found nothing but a few 'log pens.' One of&#xD;
them he fitted up for himself and wife, for he had no chih&#xD;
dren at that time; and as soon a~ ho got somewhat settled&#xD;
his first improvements consisted in the erection of sixteen&#xD;
commodious cabins, that were in equal~ numbers arranged in&#xD;
two parallel lines, making what appeared to be the begin-&#xD;
ing of a handsome street. At the head was built a large&#xD;
double cabin, with a spacious verandah, as the house of the&#xD;
overseer. These buildings finished, Mr. Moreton contin-&#xD;
ued for a long time to reside in his now, by contrast, still&#xD;
more humble hut, and he became for a while quite famous&#xD;
for furnishing his negroes better houses than he himself&#xD;
occupied.&#xD;
"Have you had much sickness on your place?" inquiry.&#xD;
ed Mrs. Moreton, as she walked along.&#xD;

&#xD;
Some," said Annie, hesitatingly, "but I have never&#xD;
seen any myself~"&#xD;
"'Is it possible ?" returned Mrs. Moreton; "how&#xD;
have you been so fortunate?" she asked? with a face ex-&#xD;
pressive of surprise.&#xD;
"Why1 I have never been told by Mr. Mildmay that I&#xD;
should go to the quarters on such occasions, and I am sure&#xD;
I would not vohmteer."&#xD;
"I have been accustomed from my childhood up," half&#xD;
musingly said Mrs. Moreton, "' to nurse with my own hands&#xD;
the sick.-I did it on my father's place, and have continued&#xD;
to do it ever since I was married to Mr. Moreton." As&#xD;
the lady concluded1 'she, with Annie, stepped into Aunt&#xD;
Dinah's cabin.&#xD;
In a' room sixteen by twenty feet in size, 'and destitute&#xD;
of furniture, save a very rude bedstead, the frame of which&#xD;
was nailed against the wall, lay stretched out the form of&#xD;
the patient-of the sick Dinah.&#xD;
Annie drew back with considerable dread, when ~he&#xD;
first looked into the cabin of the slave, but seeing Mrs.&#xD;
Moreton enter, and with the' most sympathetic manner,&#xD;
proceed at once to the bedside of the patient, she af-&#xD;
fe0ted to overcome her great repugnance and followed her&#xD;
hostess.&#xD;
"How do you feel, Dinah?" said her mistress, taking&#xD;
the sick woman's hand unresistingly in her own.&#xD;
The negress seemed to have fallen into a doze, and when&#xD;
she opened her eyes, the astonishment she displayed. was&#xD;
unbounded, as' she beheld not only her mistress, but the&#xD;
delicate form of Annie~ bending over her.&#xD;
&#xD;
"What is the matter?" inquired Mrs. Moreton, with a&#xD;
soothing voice.&#xD;
"I' done got berry sick," said Dinah, ~till in wonder.&#xD;
"Let me look at your tongue," said Mrs. Moreton.&#xD;
The negress did as she was desired, and Mrs. Moreton,&#xD;
after a moment's speculation, said:&#xD;
"Dinah, you have been eating something to make you&#xD;
sick; I see it by your high fever, and believe it, because&#xD;
little Ann gives me to understand you have been complain-&#xD;
ing again of pain.~~&#xD;
"I ain't done eat nothing, " said the woman 'stolidly,&#xD;
and giving a sigh, at the same time groaning and turning&#xD;
her face to the wall.&#xD;
Mrs. Moreton was not to be deceived. To Annie's sur-&#xD;
prise she cross-questioned the wonian, and again looked at&#xD;
her tongue, and finally pressed her delicate fingers upon&#xD;
the negress' chest.&#xD;
"I see how it is," said Mrs. ~Moreton finally, a shade of&#xD;
regret passing over her face, "you have been to the water-&#xD;
melon patch, and have likely killed yourself."&#xD;
"Aint done eat nothing' " repeated Dinah.&#xD;
Hasn't Dinah been eating water-melon?" said Mrs.&#xD;
Moreton to little Ann, who just at that moment came into&#xD;
the cabin.&#xD;
"Only one, missrn, said the child.&#xD;
Mrs. Moreton sat down at the foot of the dirty' bed, as&#xD;
if perfectly disheartened, 'and with a face full of feeling she&#xD;
said to Annie:&#xD;
"Mrs. Mildmay,~ I sat up nearly all last night with that&#xD;

see, by her own imprudence, my labor is lost, and perhaps&#xD;
her life endangered," and then turning to little Ann, she&#xD;
said: "go over, to the house, and tell your Mistress Mar-&#xD;
garet, to~ send me the bottle of medicine I was using yes-&#xD;
terday."&#xD;
"Yes'em," said little Ann, running out to perform the&#xD;
errand.&#xD;
"How came you to disobey me ?" said Mrs. Moreton,&#xD;
turning, to the invalid.&#xD;
""Cause I had nothing' to eat," gruffly replied the pa-&#xD;
tient.&#xD;
"Did you not," said Mrs. Moreton, "get some soup to-&#xD;
day that 1 made for you myself?"&#xD;
"Never got nothin'," said the negress, grOwing still&#xD;
more sullen.&#xD;
"Ali n~e!" said Mrs. Moreton much annoyed, and turn-&#xD;
ing to Annie, she said:'&#xD;
"You will find, Mrs. Mildmay, after you have had my&#xD;
experience, that a' planter's wife is the greatest slave that&#xD;
exists. If I don't see to every thing, all goes wrong. The'&#xD;
soup, that I prepared to-day with ~o much care for&#xD;
this very negress, I have no doubt was eaten up by little&#xD;
Ann.&#xD;
By this time, 'little Ann had returned, bringing Mrs.&#xD;
Moreton's parasol.&#xD;
"I did not send you for this," said Nrs. Moreton, in&#xD;
great vexation. "What did you tell Mistress Margaret I&#xD;
wanted?"&#xD;
'"Something you done had yesterday, missis," said&#xD;
&#xD;
little Ann, perfectly unconscious that she had made any&#xD;
mistake.&#xD;
"I see how it is," remarked Mrs. Moreton, taking up&#xD;
~he parasol, "1 shall have to go hack to my room, and&#xD;
either return myself or send down Aunt Margaret, or I&#xD;
shall never be certain that what I desire is done aright,"&#xD;
and wrapping her shawl around her, the two ladies walked&#xD;
slowly home.&#xD;
"I am sure," said Annie, after they left the hearing&#xD;
of the patient, "that I never can be so good a nurse as you.&#xD;
Why, Mrs. Moreton," she continued, "I cannot over-&#xD;
come my repugnance to the blacks enough, to 1~ar with com-&#xD;
fort the necessary ~i~esence of my servants, and I fear that&#xD;
I could never be of use, by the side of those that *~re sick."&#xD;
"I xievcr had such feelings," said Mrs. Moreton, with-&#xD;
out expressing the least, emotion of curiosity or surprise.&#xD;
The moment that the mistress and guest were gone,&#xD;
Violet, who watched them from the ~chamber window, went&#xD;
back into the room where she first met Annie, and taking&#xD;
up that lady's bonnet she placed it upon l~r~~head, and&#xD;
drawing the ears close down to her face, she surveyed the&#xD;
effect with evident admiration.. ~he next put on the riding&#xD;
habit and throwing a shawl over her left arm, she graceful-&#xD;
ly lifted the long skirt from about her feet, and commenced&#xD;
a pantomime, in which was displayed with artistic perfec-&#xD;
tion, not only Annie'&amp;amp;manner, but also Mrs~ Moreton.'s, and&#xD;
the nice distinction which Violet made in the characters,&#xD;
as she carried on an imaginary conversation, could notbe&#xD;
excelled.&#xD;
The "favorite s~ryant "~ then leaned agectedly upon a&#xD;

&#xD;
high-backed arm-chair, and eyeing the red velvet of the&#xD;
upright~ cushion with the most languishing expression; she&#xD;
said: "Why, Mr. Mildmay, I am so fatigued, I'm mighty&#xD;
glad we got to Mr. Moreton's, it's so very warm to-day;"&#xD;
then throwing the shawl around her shoulders, she Wrapped&#xD;
it close to 'her person, and completely changing her voice,&#xD;
she continued: "Really, I am so perfectly distracted with&#xD;
the noise of the children, and the care of them miserable&#xD;
idle servants, Mr. MoretQn, that I shall certainly go crazy."&#xD;
Next falling into the chair and assuming a benign smile,&#xD;
she turned towards the door and went on: "There, sister,&#xD;
is that dear smart child again. Come~ here, Toots, don't&#xD;
you see your mother is annoyed; come~g&amp;amp;downwithA~t&#xD;
Margaret and leave these unkind people," and then jump-&#xD;
ing up, in the imaginary person of Annie Mildmay, she&#xD;
courteseyed around the room; until, perceiving her mistress&#xD;
just at the entrance of the house, she, hastily threw aside&#xD;
her borroWed plumage, and met that lady in the great hall,&#xD;
with a meekness and innocence of face, that was, perhaps,&#xD;
the be~t piece of acting she performed throughout the day.&#xD;
In the front door of the 'house stood Aunty, with the&#xD;
baby. Atrnty was a tall, ungainly-looking woman, but pos-&#xD;
sessed a 'fine expression of countenance, arid' had a voice&#xD;
that sounded unusually cultivated for a negro.&#xD;
As Annie attempted to pass on she was naturally at-&#xD;
tracted to the infant, whose little dimpled hands and arms,&#xD;
and innocent unformed face, formed a strong contrast ~ith&#xD;
its hard-visaged, sable nurse. Annie stopped short, and&#xD;
raising both hands in admiration, exclaimed:&#xD;
"'The dear, dear, sweet little cherub."&#xD;
&#xD;
Aunty smiled at this involuntary compliment to her&#xD;
charge, as much as if it had been intended for herself, and&#xD;
raised "the cherub" to give, Annie a better view.&#xD;
The baby's head rolled from side to side, on its little&#xD;
shoulders, while its eyes stared out on vacancy, showing&#xD;
that the mind had not yet lit up the clear pupil of .black&#xD;
and blue.&#xD;
"The dear sweet cherub!" again exclaimed Annie, as&#xD;
she buried the child in her flaxen curls.'&#xD;
"She's moughty sweet indeed!" finally ejaculated Aunty,&#xD;
"dat child, young mistress, knows too much for her age."&#xD;
"' Knows too much?" said Annie, laughing outright at&#xD;
the very idea of such a thing.&#xD;
"Why, sartain," returned Aunty; "for dat are child&#xD;
will set and study, and think all day; she's too smart en-&#xD;
tirely, and," concluded the faithful n~rse,~,in a commisera-&#xD;
ting voice, "if she don't stop a-doing it, she'll never make&#xD;
old bones, sure and sartain."&#xD;
Again Annie gave the prematurely-wise infant another&#xD;
kiss, and heartily amused at the enthusiasm of the old&#xD;
negress, followed Mrs. Moreton to her room.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
THE HOSPITABLE BOARD.&#xD;
THROUGHOUT the day, a great bustle had prevailed in Mrs.&#xD;
Moreton's kitchen. Viney, the cook, was by due notice&#xD;
informed of the expected visit of Mr. and Mrs. Mildmay,&#xD;
and had been told to get as excellent a dinner as possible,&#xD;
in' honor of the occasion. Viney had great pride in her&#xD;
department, aiid was determined to do something that&#xD;
would do honor to the family. The consequence was, that&#xD;
she had managed to get some half-a.~dozen negroes added to&#xD;
the already over-abundant supply natural to Mr. More-&#xD;
ton's house; and the kitchen was not only crowded with&#xD;
every variety of dish, for the garnishment of the' table,&#xD;
but it was also crowded with negroes, who, on the pre-&#xD;
tence of helping the bustling and important Viney, were&#xD;
really helping themselves.&#xD;
The rustling of ladies' dresses in the hall, finally an-&#xD;
nounced, indirectly, to the gentlemen, that dinner was on&#xD;
the table; and by the time they reached the parlor, the&#xD;
folding-doors were thrown open, and the ladies~were dis-&#xD;
covered, already seated at the hospitable board.&#xD;
&#xD;
Col. Lee was all compliments, ana before taking his&#xD;
seat, he congratulated Mrs. Moreton on her fine appear-&#xD;
ance, expressed the most profound pleasure at meeting&#xD;
with Mrs. Mildmay, "of whose beauty he had heard so&#xD;
much," and then seated himself beside' Aunt Margaret,&#xD;
whom he called "a lady of the Old Dominion."&#xD;
Mildmay was more ceremonious, and after exPressing&#xD;
his pleasure at seeing Mrs. Moreton, and Mrs. Marbury&#xD;
(Aunt Margaret), he gave a look of pleasurable intelli.&#xD;
gence to Annie, and seated himself by her side. This&#xD;
being done, lVfr. Moreton took his place at the head of the&#xD;
table, and looking over the viands~ and his guests, with in-&#xD;
tense satisfaction, he ordered the soup to be handed round,&#xD;
and fell himself to carving the magniicent~-and on a&#xD;
Southern table, never to be dispensed with-ham, that un-&#xD;
til then, untouched by knife, w~s resting before him.&#xD;
On the first sound of the spoons upon the dishes, there&#xD;
came a. noise in the hall, as of heavy drops of 'rain beating&#xD;
upon a roof; then could be Jieard children's voices, and in&#xD;
another instant, a dozen or more of boys and girls, of all&#xD;
sizes and ages, came rushing into the dining-room, clamor-&#xD;
ing for something to eat, and evidently urged on by a&#xD;
score of little negroes, that, in the rear, ably supported&#xD;
these impetuous applicants.&#xD;
"These children must all be" carried off," said Mr.&#xD;
Moreton, holding up his carving-knife and fork, and look-&#xD;
ing around as~ if lie expected every moment that he. him-&#xD;
self would be devoured.&#xD;
"Toots ain't doin 'way!" said that little romp, tum-&#xD;
bling from some place plump into the middle of 'the room,&#xD;

THE MASTER'S HOUSE;&#xD;
&#xD;
"me doin to eat dinner, and passenger, and cake, and. pie,&#xD;
and-and-and~ chickenses," and when she got thus far,&#xD;
Mrs. Moreton put h~r hands to her ears, and begged Aunt&#xD;
Margaret "to take that child, and all the children, away,&#xD;
until dbaner was over."&#xD;
"Take Toots up!" said Aunt Margaret to a matronly-&#xD;
looking negro woman, the seamstress, who had volunteered&#xD;
to wait on the table; "take ,Toots up!" continued Aunt&#xD;
Margaret, "and amus~ her as you best can."&#xD;
"I won't go~ to Phyllis ! " said Toots, jumping up and&#xD;
do~ti the room, and falling heels over head against Annie's&#xD;
feet.&#xD;
"Come; little missis!" saidPhyllis, catching hold of&#xD;
~L~pots,'" come, and I'll tell you that pretty story."' Toots&#xD;
yielded in an instant, and fairly springing into her nurse's&#xD;
arms, she could be heard rattling away, until her voice was&#xD;
lost in the distanc~~telling Phyllis how much "she liked&#xD;
to hear that pretty 'tory of the horses, and cagiges, and&#xD;
women, and dogs."~&#xD;
Meanwhile the mass of the children, including George,&#xD;
Augustliis, Minty, Clotilde, Charley, and "little Moreton,"&#xD;
made a compromise with their father, that they were to&#xD;
have a table set' in an adjoining room (this was a favorite&#xD;
plan of the servants); in the meanwhile, they were to go&#xD;
out in the yard ai~d play.&#xD;
Phyllis carried Toots into the main road, and, sitting&#xD;
down under the ~had~ of a magnificent live-oak, she spread&#xD;
a shawl on the ground, on whi~h she put her little mistress,&#xD;
and told Toots for the fortieth time the following story; it&#xD;
being remarkable; that at each relation, Toots made the&#xD;
&#xD;
same comments, asked the same questions, and appeared&#xD;
more than 'at any previous time, 'breathless, with excited&#xD;
interest.~&#xD;
Dar "was once, young missis," began Jhyllis; "a&#xD;
white gentleman, as married another wife, and she was the*&#xD;
stuck-.upest woman that never was."&#xD;
"What did she do?" asked Toots; out of breath with&#xD;
expectation.&#xD;
"Why, whipped all her ldack people, just for nothing' at&#xD;
all,," continued Phyllis.&#xD;
"She wouldn't whip you, would she?" said T~ot~,&#xD;
throwing her arms round Phyllis's neck.&#xD;
"Wal, I 'spect not," said the girl, caressing the child,&#xD;
"but now listen,-.-.you see dis stuck up white lady had&#xD;
three daughters, the biggest ones she made set bathe parw.&#xD;
br, under skeeterr bars, all day, and do nothing' but have&#xD;
the black people wait ~n 'em, all the time; and de other&#xD;
daughter, who was mighty handsome, ~as~ kept up stairs,&#xD;
and wouldn't done let her go riding horseback, nor to New&#xD;
Orleans, nor nowhar.&#xD;
"Now, you see," continued Phyllis, "somebody on de&#xD;
joiningg plantation gave ~a big ball, and 'vited all de great&#xD;
people, hut didn't 'vite little Cind'rella; her stuck-up&#xD;
mother wouldn't let her go along with her bad sisters."&#xD;
"I'd a kicked and hollered, and told father, if they&#xD;
didn't let me go to ball, and have cake, and candies, and&#xD;
chances, and apples."&#xD;
"I know you would," said Phyllis, looking admiringly&#xD;
at Toots, "but, you see that this little Cind'rella didn't&#xD;
do it, but just staid at home and cried; when dai w~ ~i&#xD;

wanted to go to the ball, 'cause her sisters had done gone&#xD;
already. Now Cind'rella she couldn't go in course, for&#xD;
you see she had no handsome dress with yeller ribbons,&#xD;
and blue trimmings, and big breastpin, no carrige to ride,&#xD;
nor any black people to. drive to the ball; now this old&#xD;
woman was a fairy."&#xD;
"What's a fairy?" said Toots, wonderingly.&#xD;
"A fairy," said Phyllis, looking rather foolish, "is&#xD;
somebody that nobody owns, dat just goes about doin'&#xD;
nothing , and having every thing they wants, dat's a fairy,&#xD;
Miss Toots. And now," she ~continued, "listen what de&#xD;
fairy done did for Cind'rella; she tuck a punkin, and&#xD;
made a carrige, and six mouses for horses, and a big rat&#xD;
for a coach-driver, and put a new dress on, and new shoes&#xD;
on Ciud'rella, and ~ charm to make her look handsomer&#xD;
than ever, and sent her off to the big balL&#xD;
"You see," continued Phyllis, "dat de old fairy told&#xD;
Cind'rella dat she must eum home afore daybreak, her pass&#xD;

Cind'rella, 'spectin' her pass wouldn't do no longer, tuck&#xD;

"Now de rich young man, dat owned two hundred&#xD;

"Cousin Annie," suggested Poots.        -&#xD;
"Yes," said Phyllis, "Mistress Annie-and all do&#xD;

such a time was never know'd afbre.'~&#xD;
"Oh, how I would like to have been there!" said&#xD;
Toots, clapping her little hands, "wouldn't I had fim, a~id&#xD;
thrown turkey bones across the table, and made thother&#xD;
take me in her lap, and sing,. me to sleep when-" and&#xD;
Toots rose from her reclining position, and attempting to&#xD;
spin round, to show Phyllis how she would go t9 sleep,&#xD;
she twisted the shawl about her feet, and as usual, rolled&#xD;
heels over head, but instantly releasing herself she went&#xD;
whooping off down the road, in pursuit of a gaudy butter.&#xD;
fly, that was fluttering along, seemingly on purpose to en.&#xD;
tice the little fairy away from home.'&#xD;
Mr. Moreton's children assembled in the lawn, accom-&#xD;
panied by all the little negroes that could be gathered up&#xD;
on the plantation; and it was enthnskstically agreed to&#xD;
play "Runaway." George, a boy about ten years of age,&#xD;
was captain; and in his imperative manner, and restive~&#xD;
ness under restraint, displayed toward hi~ little dependents,&#xD;
was a perfect representation of hi~ father. ile organized&#xD;
the play that gave theni all so much pleasure.&#xD;

master," personated the '"runaway;" and according to&#xD;
direction, he tracked over the lawn, running around the&#xD;
trees, and behind the out-buildings,---turning and twisting&#xD;
in every possible direction, so as not to cross his own foot-&#xD;
*&#xD;
steps. The children, white and black, watching the course&#xD;
of tiais little "star in the comedy," and occasionally shout-&#xD;
ing out their pleasure, whenever Puggy Bill showed any&#xD;
unusual degree of shrewdness in tracking his devious way.&#xD;
At the feet of George was held, by several officious&#xD;
little negro boys-a young, and scarcely weaned, deer-&#xD;
hounds Tl~ie animal-pup though it was, showed by it~&#xD;
heavy limbs, long, silken ears, and bright eyes, that it wa~&#xD;
of game blood. It seemed to understand that it occupied&#xD;
a prominent place in the amusements of the hour, and&#xD;
rested patiently until it was time for action.&#xD;
At length Puggy 13111 completed his circuit, and came&#xD;
up, quite out of breath, to the group he some fifteen mm-&#xD;
utes before had left; when, at a given signal, ~' Olamper,"&#xD;
the puppy, was put on "the trail;" and as he set off~&#xD;
childish shouts encouraged him on his way. The dog,&#xD;
with his nose close to the ground, followed iPuggy Bill's&#xD;
tracks with a precision that gave the children the greatest&#xD;
delight; and ~s he wound around and followed, to admiring&#xD;
eyes, the unseen course, he was continually cheered. Ex-&#xD;
cited himself, at last, as he was nearing the end of the&#xD;
chase, the puppy began to give forth cries of excitement,&#xD;
and opened its unformed throat, and yelped with puppy joy.&#xD;
Presently he threaded the group of children, and&#xD;
leaped rapturously on Puggy Bill, who received the fa'~ror-&#xD;
ite with open arms, covering him with caresses; "young&#xD;
&#xD;
master" George, meanwhile, going on with various expli-&#xD;
catives, as if the runaway, although caught, had made&#xD;
resistance, and consequently had to be beaten, or shot&#xD;
down.&#xD;
The sumptuous dinner was brought to a close,-Annie&#xD;
stood under the gallery, equipped in her riding-dress,.......&#xD;
CoL Lee had insisted that h~r palfrey should be brought&#xD;
close up to the door. Mr. Moreton and Aunt Margaret&#xD;
shook Annie cordially by the hand, and repeated over and&#xD;
over again the pleasure they had experienced in her so-&#xD;
ciety. Mr. Moreton and Col. Lee courteously contended&#xD;
who should assist Annie on her horse, who, fairly mounted,&#xD;
waved her adiens; and Mildmay, springing in the saddle,&#xD;
lifted his hat, and in a moment more he and his young&#xD;
wife were cantering~ down the road,-the declining sun.&#xD;
cautioning them that they must be quick-footed, if they&#xD;
would not be surroundedd while in the forest by the soli-&#xD;
tude of night.&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
THE TITLE DEED.&#xD;
SQUIRE ANDREW Uorunr ~ras professedly a justice of the&#xD;
peace; his chief business, however, was writing out bills&#xD;
for the sale of negroes. He was naturally a pompous man,&#xD;
but generally concealed this peculiarity, as he was depend-&#xD;
ent upon the good will of the populace for his official dig-&#xD;
nity. Hobby had a high regard for Mildmay, simply&#xD;
because that gentleman had never treated him with the&#xD;
least passing notice; and he was accordingly quite flat-&#xD;
tered, when Mildmay checked his horse in front of his&#xD;
little office one morning, and stated that he desired at a&#xD;
particularly named time his official services at the "Hen&#xD;
tage Place."&#xD;
"And what is it you desire of me?" inquired Hobby&#xD;
before Mildmay had time to finish his commission.&#xD;
"Simply," returned Graham, "to execute the papcr~&#xD;
for the ~sale of a negro; and my reason for troubling you&#xD;
to come out to my house is, that it may possibly be incon-&#xD;
venient for Mrs. Mildmay to visit Beechland, to sign the&#xD;
title deed."&#xD;
&#xD;
~~J~ll CO~UC Gut with pleasure," said Hobby, rubbing&#xD;
his hands with excitement; "this office of mine is not&#xD;
much of a place to invite ladies in.".&#xD;
"The office is well enough," said Mildrnay; "but&#xD;
ladies, you are aware, find it difficult to leave home."&#xD;
"They do," returned Hobby, with emphasis; and&#xD;
suddenly assuming his natural manner, he- continued,&#xD;
"Ladies thrive best in the domestic circle, surrounded by&#xD;
the endearments of home; and, as the editor of the South-&#xD;
ern War Trumpet observes, depending for support upon&#xD;
the sterner sex, as the vine upon the lordly oak."&#xD;
~ are quite a~ enthusiast, Mr. Hobby, when allud-&#xD;
ing to the sex," returned Mildmay, gathering up the loose&#xD;
bridle-reins, and preparing to leave.&#xD;
Quite," said Hobby, trying to look impressive;&#xD;
"quite, Mr. Mildmay, for we can never return the debt of&#xD;
gratitude we owe to woman."&#xD;
Graham struck his spur gently into his horse's flanks,&#xD;
and as the genei~ous animal started off; he muttered to&#xD;
himself; "Confound that fellow's stereotyped compli-&#xD;
ments; why don't he practise some of his professions, by&#xD;
taking the most ordinary care of his notoriously neglected&#xD;
wife."&#xD;
When Mildmay reached home, ~1r. Speers was waiting&#xD;
for him upon the gallery of the house. Miidmay saluted&#xD;
the gentleman, and after a few mome~uts' conversation&#xD;
with~ Annie, returned to his guest.&#xD;
"I saw Squire Hobby," said he, drawing up a chair,&#xD;
and ordering Governor to bring some refreshments; "and&#xD;

I presui~e he will soon be here, as I saw his horse saddled&#xD;
before I left town."&#xD;
"I'm not specially engaged at this time," returned&#xD;
Spears, in a drawling voice, filing his tumbler half full of&#xD;
brandy, and declining any water. "I've been over the&#xD;
crap this morning,' he continued, "and though smartly&#xD;
in the grass, I reckon the niggers can get along without&#xD;
being touched up, till night, if they must."&#xD;
"I am very sorry," said Mildmay, going to his desk,&#xD;
and getting out some papers, "that Mr. Murritt, when he&#xD;
sold line the girl Mary, did not say you owned her hus..&#xD;
band."&#xD;
"He wouldn't a' told you that, and been sharp at a&#xD;
trade," saisl Speers, his eyes twinkling at the preposterous&#xD;
idea of a trader's saying any thing to interfere with a bar-&#xD;
gain; "for," he suggested, maybee, you wouldn't have&#xD;
bought the girl, if you know'd she had been separated from&#xD;
her husband."&#xD;
"I certainly would not," said Mildmay, his face riush-&#xD;
ing with excitement.&#xD;
"And do you 'spose," said Speers, with a kind of tri-&#xD;
umph unconsciously displayed in his voice, "that Murritt&#xD;
could make a living if he consulted his niggers as to how&#xD;
he should sell 'em?"&#xD;
Mildmay bit his lip, and internally acknowledging, in&#xD;
spite of himself, that his long residence in the North had&#xD;
unprepared him somewhat for the associations around him;&#xD;
and, at the moment, perceiving the busy Mr. Hobby ap-&#xD;
proaching, he walked toward the gate to meet him, and&#xD;
lead the way to the house.&#xD;
&#xD;
Again the ceremony of drinking w~ gone through&#xD;
with, much to the gratification of Speers and Hobby,-.-the&#xD;
latter gentleman observing, much to the admiration - of&#xD;
Spears,&#xD;
"4Phat if he ever did own a big plantation, he rather&#xD;
thought if he hadn't any thing else good, he would have&#xD;
'No. 1,' spirits;" when) suddenly recollecting that Speers&#xD;
owned only a small plantation, he continued, smiling toward&#xD;
that gentleman, "in the mean time, I'd have plenty of&#xD;
plain whiskey."&#xD;
"This Mildmay is rather a stiff man," said Speers,&#xD;
looking nervously about, Graham having for the moment&#xD;
left his guests.&#xD;
"He is," almost whispered Hobby; "but you see,"&#xD;
he went on, "it's the way with the rich,-.-they can afford&#xD;
to put on airs."&#xD;
"But," continued Speers, with a sort of injured ex-&#xD;
pression, "Mildmay won't drink,~-.wnn't frolic,...-won't&#xD;
card,~won't chaw,---and smokes a cigar as if he didn't&#xD;
love it; what kind of a man is that?" and Speers looked&#xD;
at Hobby as if he had given a question too difficult for&#xD;
human solution.&#xD;
"Why, you see, the fact is," said Hobby, puckering&#xD;
up his mouth with the expression that he assumed when&#xD;
on "the bench," "you see Mr. Mildmay, though born in&#xD;
old Carolina, ~as raised among the Yankees, and his edi-&#xD;
cation has been neglected; I haven't lived, Mr. Speers, in&#xD;
]3eechland nigh on to fifteen years for nothing:" and&#xD;
Hobby looked more profound than ever, and touching&#xD;
Speers upon the breast, he continued:&#xD;

&#xD;
"We have had a good many cases here like Mildmay,&#xD;
that didn't cut up such shindys more than a year or two,&#xD;
and then begun and went it strong to make up. Why&#xD;
Jim Ruggles, as keeps the race-track, and was tried last&#xD;
court for stocking cards, commenced 'here nine years ago&#xD;
worse than Mildmay."&#xD;
"That Jim Ruggles is a good fellow," said Speers,&#xD;
with great sympathy, and not exactly comprehending Esq.&#xD;
hobby's meaning; and he continued, with some, anima-&#xD;
tion, "that 'ere 'ditement 'bout the cards was done, just&#xD;
'cause Ruggles is so poor that he can't perfect himself&#xD;
from abuse."&#xD;
"That's true,.-that's true," said the politic Hobby;&#xD;
"for you see," added he, "Major Lively said to the court,&#xD;
'that if wringing in an ace or two at the last game was&#xD;
to be made a fine of, why he could present the hull bar&#xD;
to the grand jury;' and so the matter dropped."&#xD;
When Mildmay retiirned to the gallery, he was accom-&#xD;
panied by a negro girl about twenty years of age, whose&#xD;
dabbled homespun garments betrayed that she had but&#xD;
just left the wet grass of the cotton field.&#xD;
"Here's Mary," said he, to Mr. Spears; "you have&#xD;
seen her, and are willing to purchase her at the stipulated&#xD;
price of six hundred dollars ?"&#xD;
Spears rolled his eyes over towards the girl, and exam-&#xD;
ined her from head to foot; then getting up, and whirling&#xD;
her . jound by a rough jerk of her shoulder, and stooping&#xD;
down and rubbing with his finger a perceptible scar on the&#xD;
calf of the girl's leg, he again seemed desirous to take a&#xD;
good look, and stood off, and put himself in an attitude&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
assumed by connoisseurs when viewing at a rare picture.&#xD;
He then turned to her, and abruptly sajd,&#xD;
"How conic that scar on your leg?".&#xD;
"It's whar a dog bit me," said the girl, with perfect&#xD;
indifference. "Squire Hobby," said Speers, "look at&#xD;
that scratch there, and tell me if you. believe that girl's&#xD;
lying.&#xD;
Hobby at once assumed his official face, and, stooping&#xD;
down, appeared to make a most critical inspection.&#xD;
"What do you think of it?" said Speers, finally grow-&#xD;
in g impatient.&#xD;
"Why," said the learned justice, "it mout have been&#xD;
made by a lash, and it mont have been made l~y a dog's&#xD;
bite, or a brier; I suspect it was the effect of accident, as&#xD;
the girl says."&#xD;
"That's enough," said Speers, seeming to be relieved~&#xD;
"for you see," he continued, ' I don't buy no scarred&#xD;
niggers; if I want any sich marks ~on my property, I'll&#xD;
make 'cm myself."&#xD;
"You 'have decided positively not to sell this girl's&#xD;
husband to me?" said Graham.&#xD;
"Yes," said Speers, gruffly; "fo~' you see, Mr. Mild-&#xD;
may, I don't know why. I shouldn't own a good nigger as&#xD;
well as any body else."&#xD;
"Nor do I," said Mildmay, thoroughly annoyed; "I&#xD;
wish Mr. Spears you owned a hundred, if you desire to,-&#xD;
only I 'regret that I should have been the instrument of&#xD;
separating the wife from a negro, to whom you seem so&#xD;
niuch attached,"&#xD;

A TALE OF SOUTHER~T LIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
I'76            THE MASTER'S HOUSE;&#xD;
&#xD;
Spears evidently felt mortified that he had spoken as&#xD;
he did, and in a milder voice he said,&#xD;
"What's the use of troubling ourselves whether this&#xD;
gal lives with Cooney or not; she can find husbands&#xD;
enough on Heritage Place."&#xD;
"Mary," said Mildmay, turning to the negro, "when&#xD;
I proposed to buy you, you said that you were not mar-&#xD;
ned?" -&#xD;
"So I did, master," said the girl, moodily, "but if I&#xD;
hadn't told you so, Mr. Murritt would a' killed me after&#xD;
you went away.~,&#xD;
"Mr. Mildmay," said Speers, perfectly unconscious of&#xD;
the feelings agitating Graham's breast, "if you'd like to&#xD;
keep that gal, you needn't be afeard that Cooney will&#xD;
come on your premises after I tell him to keep away; I&#xD;
would like to own a nigger that would go whar I told him&#xD;
not to."&#xD;
"It is not best to tempt him so strongly to disobey&#xD;
you," said Mildmay.&#xD;
"Well, if AJooney disobeys me, it shan't ny trouble&#xD;
to you," said Speers, trying to be agreeable.&#xD;
"You see Mary," said Mildinay, turning to the girl,&#xD;
"that by being controlled, you deceived me; now you are&#xD;
at liberty to speak the truth: do you prefer to go with&#xD;
Mr. Spears, or stay with me'?"&#xD;
"I want to be with Cooney," was the terse answer.&#xD;
"Very well," said Mildmay; "now go to the quarters,&#xD;
gather up your clothes and bedding, and come to the shed&#xD;
of the blacksmith's shop in the front road."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
The girl replied, "Yes, sir," and walked away.&#xD;
1~1ildmay at once produced pen, ink, and paper; and&#xD;
with the assistance of O~o~ernor, they were with a table&#xD;
placed on the gallery; and Squire Hobby proceeded 1o&#xD;
his business of amanuensis.&#xD;
After examining the pen in every possible light, stick-&#xD;
ing the nib between his lips, turning round the paper, and,&#xD;
in fact, going through much seemingly useless pantomime,&#xD;
he assumed a very grave face; and, turning to Mildmay,&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"What's the girl's name ?"&#xD;
"Niary."&#xD;
"Her age?"&#xD;
"About twenty."&#xD;
"Consideration?"&#xD;
"Six hundred dollars," said Speers.&#xD;
"Cash?" said the squire, scratching his nose with the&#xD;
feather end of the pen.&#xD;
"Cash," said Speers, pulling out a roll of bills and&#xD;
gold half eagles, and laying them down on the table.&#xD;
These questions and answers having been obtained, the&#xD;
squire set himself to work. Graham meanwhile went up&#xD;
into Annie's room, and informed her that her presence was&#xD;
necessary one moment to sign the bill of sale.&#xD;
The little wife was trembling and nervous, and it in-&#xD;
stantly attracted Mildmay's attention. "What can the&#xD;
matter be, Annie?" said he, tenderly putting his ~rm&#xD;
round her waist.&#xD;
I' Nothing," said she, trying to look unconcerned;&#xD;
"but you know that I am not accustomed to the forms of&#xD;

perhaps I am not as well as I might be."&#xD;
"I fear so," said Graham, looking affectionately down&#xD;
into her. face; "you confine yourself too much; let&#xD;
us get clear of this loquacious squire, and our plain, but&#xD;
I have no doubt worthy neighbor, Mr. Sp~s, and then&#xD;
for a ride down the road. 'Srrnnyside'is getting as fat&#xD;
as a Christmas goose just for want of exercise."&#xD;
"A ride le1~ it be,~' said Annie, with animation; anc?~&#xD;
arm-and-arm they proceeded to the gallery.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Squire Hobby was intently busy on the&#xD;
longest word in the matter before him; and as* he never&#xD;
could master that particular word without much trouble,&#xD;
he was working it out, by pronouncing aloud each letter a~&#xD;
he went along; while Speers was intently watching pro-&#xD;
gress,-he having great interest that every thing should be&#xD;
done right.&#xD;
"There's 'redhibitory' written out in full," said they&#xD;
squire, breathing freely, as if he had accomplished a gi~&#xD;
gantic task.&#xD;
"What does it mean?" asked Speers, gathering up all&#xD;
his money in his hand.&#xD;
"Why it means just this,"~ said the squire, waving his&#xD;
pen around in a sort of flourish; "it means this: 'Redhi-~&#xD;
bitio~, 'cording to The Code (art. 2497), means th~ avoid-'&#xD;
c~rwe of pale on account of some vice or defect of the' thing&#xD;
sold, whioh ~renders its use either absolutely useless, or its~&#xD;
use so inconvenient and imperfect, that it must be ~up~&#xD;
posed that the buyer. would not have purchased it, had he&#xD;
knpwn of the vice.'"&#xD;
&#xD;
A TAL]i O1~' 5OUTI11~RN ~JFE.&#xD;
"Does it mean all that 'ere'?" said Speers, looking&#xD;
with a sort of awe upon llohby.&#xD;
"It don't do any 'thing else," said the squire, really&#xD;
excited; "and there's maity a lawyer as would charge you&#xD;
a double 'V' for not half that information."&#xD;
"Has :M~ry got any thing of the kind you have'just&#xD;
been reading about?" continued Speers, putting back his&#xD;
money into his pocket.&#xD;
Not as I knows on," said the squire, enjoying the&#xD;
triumph achieved by his legal knowledge; "for you see,&#xD;
Mr. Spears, the Code says:&#xD;
"'Nor can the buyer (art. 2498) institute the redhihi-&#xD;
tory action, on account of the latent defects, which the&#xD;
seller has declared to him before or at the time of the&#xD;
sale."'&#xD;
"What does that 'mean ~ said Speers, his ideas now&#xD;
nearly all aground.&#xD;
"Why,~' continued the squire, "the 'latent defects'&#xD;
of niggers and animals, 'cording to the Code (art. 2500),&#xD;
is divided into two classes; vices of body,-vices of char-&#xD;
acter. The absohLte vices of hox~ses' and mules is short&#xD;
wind and glanders; the absolute vices of niggers 'is lep..&#xD;
rosy, madness, and epilepsy. The vices 'of character&#xD;
which give rise to the redhibition of slaves is, that the&#xD;
slave has committed a capital crime, or is addicted , to&#xD;
theft, or running away; and they ain't no vices of chara~&#xD;

"But you don't mean to say," said Speers, now per-&#xD;

"I i&amp;amp;ean,~' said Squire Hobby, endeavoring to imitate&#xD;
his ideal standard of judicial dignity, "that if this nigger&#xD;
iIU ~Ea~ry has any of them 'ere things, and you fi~4At out afore&#xD;
j~$+K~ it is'too late, just because Ii tuck that 'ere word redhibb.&#xD;

laid back in his chair, ~as if deeply fatigued under his&#xD;
ofi~oial importance, when his eye caught sight of Miklmay&#xD;
and Annie coming toward them.&#xD;
The delicate sylph~ike beauty of Annie attracted~ both&#xD;
these individuals; and their admiration, involuntarily ex-&#xD;
pressed, could not be felt less than complimentary-it was&#xD;
so sincere. Annie took her seat near the table, and after&#xD;
a few moments' ~pause, Squire Hobby went on, and com-&#xD;
pleted his labor.&#xD;
- The, moment that. Mildmay saw the' paper was drawn&#xD;
up, he proposed at once to close the transaction, pleading,&#xD;
as a reason 'far his haste, 'pressing engagements ~upon his&#xD;
time. This would have been done, but for the squires&#xD;

dred dollars each were counted out, and sb~~ed yy~z~&#xD;
towards Esq. lobby~ Mildinay remarking, "that the&#xD;
amount was right."&#xD;
The squire inwardly congratulated him~e1f upon the&#xD;
opportunity he had of displaying his varied talents before&#xD;
Annie, and in an unusually loud voice, even for him, begaii&#xD;
to read as follows:&#xD;
"Beechland, June 15th, 1 8-.. Know all men by these&#xD;
presents, that I, Graham Mildrnay, of the first part, do, by'&#xD;
these presents, grant, bargain, se4J4a~id Convey to Mi. Jo..&#xD;

girl named Mary La Tour, aged about twenty years, of&#xD;
a dark and nearly black color, no distinguishing rnaulrs of&#xD;
form, scars, or peculiarities remembered~..)'  -'&#xD;
"There is~ a dog bite on the calf of her leg," said&#xD;
Spears, turning perfectly red with astonishment, as he&#xD;
raised his eyes and saw Annie looking on with surprise7&#xD;
for Speers, was so intent with the purchase, that the  ~&#xD;
ing of the bill for the moment banished every thi~g~~ ~&#xD;
from his mind.&#xD;
"It's a mere form," said the squire, gesticulating;with&#xD;
his hand, "mer&amp;amp; form, Mr. Spears."&#xD;
"And more verbose than positively necessary, i~ it&#xD;
not?" said Mildmay, exceedingly vexed that Annie had&#xD;
been compelled to be present.&#xD;
"Not at all," said the squire. I copied this form from&#xD;
Col. Lee's document, when he sold Tom Jefferson, oi~Jeff&#xD;
as he was called, and~ it is admitted that Lee is the best&#xD;

"Well, go on," said Mildmay very impatiently.; and as&#xD;
if t'o protect Annie from further rude remarks, he put ~his&#xD;
arm around her chair.&#xD;
"Where was I ?" said the squire, taking up the paper&#xD;
before him. "Oh-ah--J know," and he went on as fol-&#xD;
lows:&#xD;
"No distinguishing marks of form, sears, or particulars&#xD;

Annie, who had listened to all the proceedings with&#xD;
mechanical attention, now arose, as Graham, taking the pen&#xD;
in his hand, signified that the title deed was:~ complete.&#xD;
He then dashed his name across the paper, placed the pen&#xD;
in Annie's hand and pointed where she should place her&#xD;
name.&#xD;
"Is this positively necessary?" said she, looking earn-&#xD;
estly at Graham. "Most certainly," said Squire HQbby,&#xD;
"you see, madam, your paraphernal rights woul&amp;amp; other-&#xD;
wise vitiate the title."&#xD;
"And break up the trade," chimed in Speers.&#xD;
Annie took up the. pen, and her usually delicate and&#xD;

evidence to Graham's eye of' the con~ict g0ing on in An~&#xD;
nie's mind, which he alone, of those who witnessed~ it, could&#xD;
appreciate.&#xD;
The duty performed, Mildmay accompanied Annie ~to&#xD;
the entrance of the great hall where stood Glemmy~; and&#xD;
leaving her with the faithful servant, Mildmay returned ,~&#xD;
took up the money still lying on the table, and crushing&#xD;
it together in his 'hand, without counting it, much to&#xD;
the astonishment of Speers, gave it to Govei'nor, and&#xD;
told him to place it in- the escritoire, and get some fresh&#xD;
water and the decanters, as he presumed the gentlemen&#xD;
were thirsty.&#xD;
The ceremony of drinking having been gone through&#xD;
with, Mildmay paid Esq. Hobby for his services, waWed&#xD;
down to the front gate, waited until both gentlemen had&#xD;
mounted, and bidding them good day, returned rapidly to&#xD;
the house. -&#xD;
Speers and Hobby rode along a rod or two, when they&#xD;
came up to Mary, who was sitting in a listless attitude on&#xD;
the stump of a fallen tree, her bundle beside her.&#xD;
"Here's your owner," said Hobby, thus giving the in-&#xD;
troduction, "and a good master he will be too," continued&#xD;
he, the politician never deserting him.&#xD;
Mary looked up, and shouldering her bundle, quietly&#xD;
asked, "Master, which way must I go?"&#xD;
"Gross the bayou beyond here, at 'the old ruined gin-&#xD;

whip, "go through the woods and you will see Cooney with&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
DIXON'S REMORSE.&#xD;
THEUE was living in the vicinity of Beechland, a&#xD;
dow, known as Mrs. Ilartshorn, past the prime of lii&#xD;
who, being deeply absorbed in the duties of per~&#xD;
looking after a large estate, attracted but little att&#xD;
in the vicinity. Her residence was much out of th&#xD;
and no one, except on business, or with direct~ inten&#xD;
visited her.&#xD;
Why she remained a widow caused the usual s~&#xD;
tion, but it was evident that she was either disincli:&#xD;

yard fence nearly destroyed,-.-in short, it was the resting-&#xD;
place of domestic animals, and never of any philanthropic&#xD;
use, unless for the temporary shelter it afforded, as a rest-&#xD;
ing-place foi~ the night, to passing emigrants.&#xD;
One afternoon, to the astonishment of the villagers,&#xD;
some twenty of Mrs. llartshorn's best field hands came&#xD;
into town in an ox Wagon, and as they proceeded along&#xD;
through the street, made the air vocal with their rude&#xD;
songs, and finally, stopping in front of the deserted church,&#xD;
they went to work with hoe and shovel, and in the course&#xD;
of a few hours' produced an improvement, that was charming&#xD;
to behold.&#xD;
The doors were partially restored to their places. 'The&#xD;
seats and floor of the h~terior of the building were carefully&#xD;
cleaned, and the 1abc~r thus bestowed, rendered the hereto-&#xD;
fore neglected building, considering the mildness of 'the&#xD;
weather, a comfortable place for the assembling together&#xD;
of the people:&#xD;
The succeeding morning the So4hern .'J1ctrion~, the&#xD;
local taper of Beecliland, in the most conspicuous place in&#xD;
its editorial column~, contained the following notice.&#xD;
* "We ha~e th&amp;amp; pleasure of announcing to our numerous&#xD;
readers, and all others in the vicinity of our thriving and&#xD;
prosperous town, that the Reverend W.' Claremont Gos-&#xD;

and he will probably continue whh us throughout the entire'&#xD;
weej~. It is presumed that he will be greeted with an&#xD;
overflowing audience.. We hardly think that it is neces-&#xD;
sary ~to remind our readers, that Mr. Goshawk, on a&#xD;
recent visit to the North, was attacked by many of the&#xD;
fanatical clergymen in that part of the country on the sub-&#xD;
ject of Christian'slaveholder~, and that his defence of our&#xD;
time-honored institution, was admitted to be the finest&#xD;
piece of eloquence, avid most stirring appeal that has ap-&#xD;
peared for years ; he entirely silenced the wolves in sheep's&#xD;
clothing, who, under the guise of the religious cloak, are car-&#xD;
rying torches in their hands to fire the temple of our great&#xD;
republic. ~By the kindness of one of our most beautiful and&#xD;
accomplished ladies in the vicinity of J3eechland, who has&#xD;
in this case acted in a manner so characteristic of the gen-&#xD;
tler sex, our little temple of worship; so long the cherished&#xD;
ornament of our town, and whose spire so plainly points the&#xD;
way to heaven, has been thoroughly scrubbed out and&#xD;
renovated, and will afford comfortable seats for our entire&#xD;

The weather was exceedingly pleasant, and ther~ was a&#xD;
universal desire to hear the Rev. Mr. Geshawk. That'&#xD;
dignitary, himself, had been for more than a day the in-&#xD;
mate of Mrs. Hartshorn's house, for it was suddenly re-&#xD;
called to the mind of some of the people around the Head-&#xD;
quarters, that early one morning, 'they saw a 'tall's and&#xD;
good-looking gentleman, dressed in black, in ~the widow's&#xD;

&#xD;
* iipwar4, she found this privilege most difficult to dispense&#xD;
with, and the moment the public notice met her eye, she&#xD;
consulted Graham, who gave Governor orders to have the&#xD;
* carriage in readiness for the following Sabbath morning.&#xD;
For a long time ]3eechland had not borne so gay an ap-&#xD;
pearanee, as i~ did in its desire to do honor to the Rev.&#xD;
lWr. Goshawk. Families; living many miles distant, had&#xD;
come to "hear the discourse," and almost all of the avail-&#xD;
able ground in the immediate vicinity of the church; was&#xD;
occupied by s~ylendid "~tur~n-outs,"-in fact the carriages,:in&#xD;
number and equipment, would have done honor to some&#xD;
state occasion.&#xD;
People~iho h&amp;amp;d been living' in each other's neighbor-&#xD;
hood for years, now met~ to renew acquaintances that had&#xD;
grow1~ dull for want~ of attrition, and a genial feeling per-&#xD;
vaded the entire assemblage.&#xD;
* The very sight of the pleasing throng, the subdued,&#xD;
yet self-evident bustle, revived in Annie's mind, most&#xD;
vividly, the joyous feelings that she felt at Malden, on&#xD;
similar occasions, and a delightful glow of excitement lit&#xD;
up her usually rather pale faces as she absolutely threw&#xD;
herself carelessly into Mildmay's arms, as he assisted her&#xD;
from the carriage to the ground. "Really, Graham," said&#xD;
she, her face radiant with smiles, while smoothing the&#xD;
wrii;tkles from her dress, "really this is pleasant, and I&#xD;
hope Mr. Goshawk will frequently preach for us; I am&#xD;
sure I shall constantly attend."&#xD;
~rah~m smiled on Annie, and offering her his arm,&#xD;
the two proceeded into ehurch~ It was the first time that&#xD;
Annie had been seen: in public; much, of course, had been&#xD;
&#xD;
189&#xD;
&#xD;
said about her, in the neighborhood; curiosity was raised&#xD;
to know, "if so l~and~ome and rich a yoting man as Mr.&#xD;
Nildniay, had really done as well as he deserved!" But it&#xD;
was evident that the verdict was in Annie s f~vor, for' as&#xD;
she came, necessarily, in full view of the congregation, who&#xD;
sat facing the door, a telegraphic surprise rested upon the&#xD;
countenances of all, and it was by (haham observed and felt,&#xD;
that Annie excited marked admiration. -&#xD;
As for Annie, herself, the moment' she stepped inside&#xD;
of the church, she felt a solemnity of feeling pervade her&#xD;
heart, that drove all other thoughts, for the moment, from&#xD;
her mind, as she passed to a proffered seat, and bent her,&#xD;
head in prayer, as perfectly self-posse8sed, as if kneeling&#xD;
at her little altar in her own room.&#xD;
The congregation had been some time in their seats, be~&#xD;
fore the reverend gentleman made his appearance. In fact,&#xD;
the first impression of quietness that prevailed, was be-&#xD;
ginning to give way. Gentlemen were seen to be moving&#xD;
about, and looking at the door, and one or two went out,&#xD;
while the young ladies began to gaze about, and recognize&#xD;
each other in the congregation, wnile Governor, and his&#xD;
fellow-servants on the outside, it was very evident, from&#xD;
sounds of suppressed laughter, had got together under the&#xD;
shade of a wide-spreading tree, and were detailing gossip,&#xD;
and cracking jokes.&#xD;
Suddenly was heard the tramp of horses, driven rapidly&#xD;
along the road,-the whip cracked, at which' two or three&#xD;
saddle nags brok&amp;amp;their kridlcs, aiid scampered down the&#xD;
village street,-.--steps were heard rapidly ~znfolded-~ sort&#xD;

gregation, arid the :Rev. Mr. Goshawk, supporting widow&#xD;
Hartshorn, made his appearance.&#xD;
It was afterwards asserted by some one, careful in such&#xD;
statistics, that almost every gentleman in the congregation&#xD;
rose involuntarily to offer the widow a seat; but nothing&#xD;
could surpass 'the dignity and urbanity, with which the&#xD;
reverend gentleman abandoned his precious charge, prepa-&#xD;
ratory to ascending the pulpit.&#xD;
The Rev. Mr.' Goshawk's appearance and manner were&#xD;
decidedly impressive, and he himself was not unconscious&#xD;
of the fact. After remaining a few moments in silent&#xD;
meditation, with his soft white hand pressed to his head,&#xD;
he beckoned to a negro boy, looking in at a side window,&#xD;
and when the fellow climbed up into the pulpit, he whi's-&#xD;
pered~ something in his ear. A long and mysterious pause&#xD;
ensued, whik the boy ran over to the Head-quarters, and&#xD;
borrowed a pitcher and tumbler, and returning, set them&#xD;
within reach of the Rev. Mr. Goshawk.&#xD;
~fhat' gentleman arose, and opening a small gilt-edged&#xD;
book, read the beautiful hymn, beginning:&#xD;
Sweet is the day of sacred rest,&#xD;
All mortal cares forsake the .breast~"&#xD;
and finishing it, desired some one present to be so kind as&#xD;
to "lead the singing," and resumed his seat.&#xD;
Several momeiits elapsed, but no voice wa~ raised;&#xD;
it' was apparent ~tfrat' one or' 'two gentlemen were half in-&#xD;
clined, but th~efr hearts or voices failed them,-.-the~ reve~.&#xD;
rend ~enile~man' finally ai~ose, and commenced himself. He&#xD;
was evidently~ etiltiv~ted in church music, and poured out&#xD;
&#xD;
a volume of' praise,' that even, unsupported as, it was,&#xD;
sounded like an organ.&#xD;
Scarcely had he sung the first line, when a sweet fe-&#xD;
male voice, clear ~s ringing glass, and as hearty as the&#xD;
birds of the field, joined in, and the two, in wonderful ac-&#xD;
cordance and harmony, concluded the stanza.&#xD;
The congregation, for the moment entranced. at the un-&#xD;
expected exhibition, the instant it ceased, turned, by uni-&#xD;
versal consent, their eyes upon the innocent face &amp;amp;f Annie,&#xD;
who, suddenly perceiving ~the extraordinary interest she&#xD;
had so unconsciously created, blushed deep crimson, and&#xD;
sank back to her Seat.'&#xD;
The reverend gentleman selected for his text, ~&#xD;
y~ Iwly, as your Father in :hecvven is holy!" and&#xD;
he made it appear as if this injunction was one of the&#xD;
most literal in the sacred book, one of the most imper~-&#xD;
tive, and necessary to bc obeyed. He drew with tremen-&#xD;
dous fervor' the character of the Great Jehovah, stated&#xD;
that none could look upon him agd live, that he filled all&#xD;
space, was the creator of all things, and yet desired to rc-&#xD;
side in the heart of corrupt anid fallen man,-.that man, in-&#xD;
clined as he was to wickedness, ~"'even as the sparks fly&#xD;
upward," was, by a holy life and godly conversation, t?&#xD;
Tender himself a fit temple, a' proper temple, a w~rtIiy tem0&#xD;
plc, for this holy, just; and omnipotent Being,-.--and then&#xD;
in a few' condensed passages, he rapidly portrayed the&#xD;
punishment of those who refused to obey this. dread 'com-&#xD;
mand.&#xD;
The congregation was swayed to and fro, asif rocked'&#xD;
in a storm-driven ship~; stern, u~mfiinehing men, 'that in the&#xD;

<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC8057-00000099"/>&#xD;
hour of danger knew no fear, blanched under the burning&#xD;
words, and ladies wept, and sighed, with hysterical emo-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
Suddenly Mr. Goshawk stopped, he appeared pained&#xD;
at the effect he had himself produced. ILsowering his voice&#xD;
to a clear, heart-breaking tone, he said&#xD;
"Brethren, think not, that the minis1~er of the Gospel&#xD;
delights in harrowing your feelings. Should he consult&#xD;
himself, he would only salute your ears with the dulcet&#xD;
strains of mercy, but alas I wo betide the prophet who re-&#xD;
fuses to cry out against Nineveli.&#xD;
"If, my friends, you hear at the solemn 'hour of mid-&#xD;
night the heart-rending cry of fire-ftre---.FIRE, do you&#xD;
rush into the streets, and "denouifte the' one who gave the&#xD;
alarm? no, you bless his name, and hastening on, you flee&#xD;
for your life from the devouring element.&#xD;
"So stand I here, crying fire-fire----to your slumber-&#xD;
ing consciences. I would, have you escape a consuming&#xD;
flame, that will not only destroy your bodies, but will tor-&#xD;
ment your souls for ever ' Flee, I say,-like Bunyan's&#xD;
Christian, put your fingers to your ears, and hasten while'&#xD;
you yet may, out of the City of Destruction."&#xD;
Among Mr. Goshawk'8 hearers was Dixon. He had,&#xD;
some weeks before, come up to' the vicinity of Beechland,&#xD;
on business, and having been taken sick, he had, while thus&#xD;
prostrated, almost ~ literally passed through the valley and&#xD;
shadow of death.. The balmy weather had~ tempted ~him&#xD;
into the street, and gratified by any novelty, he had strolled&#xD;
into church.&#xD;
While suffering ~from disease, he had QecasiQUally re-&#xD;

&#xD;
elected up&amp;amp;n hin whole] course of life, and 'had felt many&#xD;
pangs of remorse while thinking of the past; and it was,&#xD;
therefore, in a very proper disposition of mind,-that' he lis-&#xD;
tened to this 'most powerful discourse.&#xD;
When the congregation separated, the different' mem-&#xD;
bers pursued their way homeward, and left Dixon by him-&#xD;
self Although known to almost every person in the house,&#xD;
no one recognized him, save by a glance. Amid all the&#xD;
shaking of hands and congratulations, there were no de-&#xD;
monstrations ~of friendship, or interest, 'for him. In his&#xD;
usual humor, he would have vented his spleen in muttered&#xD;
oaths, and in a thousand recalled circumstances of fancied&#xD;
power and 'superiority, that he had, as an oiThet to any neg-&#xD;
lect he might receive; but now' his spirit was broken.&#xD;
There was something in Mr. Goshawk's manner and voice,&#xD;
that recalled recollections of childhood, when he used to&#xD;
go to church with his good old mother, and on coming&#xD;
home, hear her talk of the feelings that animated her~&#xD;
spirit. A thousand words of good advice, a hundred&#xD;
prayers for her dear child,' crowded upon his weakened&#xD;
brain, and he felt that he was not' only despised by man,&#xD;
but also abandoned by his Maker.&#xD;
To such an extent was his mind excited, that he hardly&#xD;
had strength to get to his lodgings, which' were comfort~&#xD;
able, although connected with the "iUead-quarters."&#xD;
Once in his room, he 'threw himself on the bed,' and&#xD;
seemed to be overcome by the communing of his thoughts;&#xD;
the acts of his life appeared in review before him, and".he&#xD;
was shocked at the scenes of injustice, blood8h~d, and&#xD;

&#xD;
violence through which he had 'passed, and, which he had&#xD;
instigated.&#xD;
Although Dixon was a native of Georgia, it had been&#xD;
impressed upon him while still a child, not only that it was&#xD;
an unpardonable thing to buy and sell his fellQw-beings,&#xD;
but, also, that it was sinful even to hold slaves. Dixon's&#xD;
ix~other was a strict Methodist, and she had been inspired&#xD;
by this feeling in her youth, by the teachings of parents,&#xD;
who claimed, while sitting under the 'unction of John Wes-&#xD;
ley's preaching, and listening to his voice "'face to face,'&#xD;
that they had been converted from the error of their ways,&#xD;
and convinced of; the sin Qf holding slaves." These were&#xD;
the impressions left by a mother upon the mind of Dixon,&#xD;
and as every reminiscence of his life, that was pleasant (o&#xD;
dwell upon, was associated with that mother, so also were&#xD;
the impressions she left most vivid and most binding~ 'on&#xD;
his cojiscience. And these early instructions now dame&#xD;
upon him with tenfold force, as the only legacy, and only&#xD;
remembered councils and obligations of one, whom,&#xD;
clouded as was his conscience in other things, he still re-&#xD;
vered as a sainted being.&#xD;
While in this mental agony, Dixon's friend, Puckett,&#xD;
who had so faithfully nursed him through his long sick-&#xD;
ness, came into his room, with a pack of cards and a&#xD;
couple of tumblers in one .hand, and a bottle of whiskey&#xD;
in the other, and setting them down on the table rear by,&#xD;
he turned to Dixon, and said:&#xD;
"Come, old fel', I have brought you up some 'picters,'&#xD;
and also something to drink, for you see you can stand a&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
little now, and I thoughV as how you'd like to have a game&#xD;
of 'old sledge,' just to pass away time."&#xD;
"I'm too sick to play, Puckett, and too weak to drink!&#xD;
some other time!" said Dixon, the perspiration starting&#xD;
on his brow, both from excitement and weakness.&#xD;
"Bah !" said Puckett, mDving a small table into the&#xD;
middle of the floor; "you don't s'pose," he continued,&#xD;
~' I've been a mother to you for these three week; not to&#xD;
know what you can stand. Drink a little, any how, is my&#xD;
matter; and drink a good deal if you can,' is my other&#xD;
matter. Come now, fotch up your chair, and let's high,&#xD;
low, Jack, and the game," and Puckett gave the cards,&#xD;
or "picters," as he called them, a scientific shuffle.&#xD;
"I can't play to-day," said Dixon, peevishly, and as-&#xD;
tonished, himself, at the repugnance he felt; "I can't play,&#xD;
for," he continued, "you know it's Sunday, Puckett."&#xD;
At this remark the Kentuckian put down the cards,&#xD;
and laying back in his chair, and' trusting his legs far&#xD;
under the table, he broke out into repeated bursts of laugh-&#xD;
ter; tears streamed down his cheeks, and at last? he rolled&#xD;
his head from side to side, as if he was too full, and could&#xD;
not get relief. He found words, however, finally, and said:&#xD;
"Dixon, by the Lox~d you will be the death of me-&#xD;
Sunday! that's a good one; can't play 'cause it's. Suiiday,"&#xD;
and Puckett again went off into hysterical 1~ughte~r, re-&#xD;
peating, "Dixoi~, you are too funny! Oh! that-that's&#xD;
too' good-too good."&#xD;
"But I'm 'serious," said Dixon, greatly annoyed.&#xD;
"That's the very thing!" said Puckett, sticking the&#xD;
pack of cards in his mouth, to keep from breaking out&#xD;

again. "You see that's. the joke, one would s'pose you was&#xD;
in real arrestt," and again he rolled about in his chair, and&#xD;
pushed his fists into ~his aching sides.&#xD;
"Puckett," said Dixon, when that worthy had become&#xD;
somewhat quiet; "Puckett, don't go down stairs and blow&#xD;
on me, but I tell you the truth now, when I say I'm going&#xD;
to reform. I'll do it, Puckett, and you may laugh as&#xD;
much as you please."&#xD;
"He he-ha ha!" cachinated that worthy, but as he&#xD;
looked up, and saw the pale and excited face of Dixon&#xD;
for the first time, a feeling of alarm came over him, and&#xD;
rising up,' he said:&#xD;
"Why, what's the matter, old boy, you loc~k as white as&#xD;
milk and water?"&#xD;
"Did y6u never think about dying, Puckett, or any&#xD;
thing of that sort?" inquired Dixon, at a loss to know how&#xD;
to get hi~ naturally good-hearted companion serious.&#xD;
"Thought about dying?" mechanically echoed he.&#xD;
"Why, yes, I thought about it once, when Igot out of to-&#xD;
backer, but I don't recollect any other time."&#xD;
"Did you never think, Puckett, about another world,&#xD;
and what will become of us if we go on breaking Sunday,&#xD;
playing cards and drinking ?-.I have thought of these&#xD;
things. I've laid here on my back for d&amp;amp;ys and nights&#xD;
and been full of thinking. I've been a bad man, Ben.&#xD;
I've seen sights in this very room tha1~ have~ made my&#xD;
brain cold; it's awful, Puckett, awful!" and Dixon's face&#xD;
settled into black despair.&#xD;
"Whet did you see, Jim?" aske4 Puekett, perfectly&#xD;
at a loss to understand the slave-trader's feelings.&#xD;

&#xD;
"I've 'seen dead nigger women,'? said Dixon in reply,&#xD;
screetchin to me for their children-I've seen nigger men&#xD;
praying for their lives-I've seen whole gangs of niggers,&#xD;
with their backs all blood, their eyes all, sunken, pointing&#xD;
their long skinny fingers at me, and they keep on doing it&#xD;
whenever I'm alone!"&#xD;
"You must have manycq~orter," said Ben, with a kind&#xD;
of soothing voice. "Didn't you see rats?" he continued,&#xD;
with an equivocal smile, and looking archly at Dixon.&#xD;
"Why, Jim Ruggles, after he had hi~ last frQlic, seed&#xD;
the 'devil; he told' me so himself; ~ tid he looked like a&#xD;
rattlesnake forty feet long, twisted all around his body,&#xD;
with his soft jawed and infernal open mouth p~it up agin his&#xD;
face, tongue, pizen-hooks and all; so seeing niggers is noth-&#xD;
ing," and Puckett looked at Dixon under the impression&#xD;
that he had conveyed much consolation by his remarks.&#xD;
"I wish that I could see a snake, or any thing, Puckett,&#xD;
'but niggers." I'm afraid of niggers,~' and as Dixon said&#xD;
this, he nervously clutched his rude but sympathizing' com-&#xD;
panion by the shoulder.&#xD;
"Is there a living nigger as can ~scare Jim Dixon?"&#xD;
asked Ben scornfully, and somewhat confounded at the ex-&#xD;
hibition he had witnessed.&#xD;
"No," said Dixon in a hissing whisper, "Dot a living&#xD;
nigger, Puckett, they 'can't scare me; it's dead niggers as&#xD;
claws at my vitals," and ag the invalid said this, he fell in&#xD;
a fainting fit back on his pillow.&#xD;
Ben instinctively lifted Dixon up, chafed his temples,&#xD;
and the moment that he displayed returning consciousness,&#xD;
gave him some water. The sick man slowly came 'to him-&#xD;

when ]3en quietly stepped away, and proceeded to' the bar-&#xD;
room, 'where sat Busteed and three or four of his patrons,&#xD;
engaged inone of their usual games of chance.&#xD;
As the Kentuckian presented himself, Busteed laid down&#xD;
"hIs hand," and with unfeigned astonishment asked:&#xD;
"What's the ntatter? IPuckett, you look as sickly as a&#xD;

"Do I?" said the 'mother,' who unconsciously to him-&#xD;
se1f~ still bore traces of his excitement at witnessing Dix-&#xD;

dressing the men before him in a znysterious voice.&#xD;
"Can't say," was the universal reply.&#xD;
'~ Well, boys, you see," s~dd he, in, almost a whisper,&#xD;
"Dixon's tuck too much; he's got 'the tremens bad, very&#xD;

"I'think it's h~bug," said ]3usteed, and with his corn-&#xD;

away~---" maybe it is," and then he walked up and down&#xD;
the room, for th~ first time in his life in profound reflection,&#xD;
and honestly wondering what the trader did mean.&#xD;
Dixon slowly recovered his strength of ~body, but not&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
DIXON AC~TJIRES PEACE OF' MIND.&#xD;
THE Sabbath morning appointed for Mr. Goshawk's second&#xD;
discourse, was one of the most delightful that ever shone&#xD;
upon Beechland. Mr. Goshawk was late in coming; h~ had&#xD;
been, against' his inclination, detained on the road, and al-&#xD;
though this caused considerable uneasiness among the mass&#xD;
of the congregation, it left Dixon more time to thoroughly&#xD;
collect hi~ ideas, 'and prepare himself according to his own&#xD;
notions for the services of the day.&#xD;
On the previous Sabbath, occasion had been taken by&#xD;
Governor, to extend his acquaintance among the servants&#xD;
out of doors, who, like himself, were occupied by the light&#xD;
labor of looking after their master's vehicles. A group of&#xD;
carriage drivers had huddled themselves beneath the shade&#xD;
of a wide-spreading oak, and there they sat in cosy and&#xD;
confidential %~onversatIon.&#xD;
Among the group was Mr. ~Eoreton's Quash, a fellow&#xD;
celebrated among his own race as a wit, and he kept his&#xD;
auditors in constant laughter, only suppressed bythe vicin~&#xD;
ity of white folks in the church.&#xD;
~,,~~~~...&#xD;
&#xD;
Quash, finding that the minister did not arrive at the&#xD;
time expected, insensibly became animated, and putting his&#xD;
hard hand upon the head of a negro sitting next to him,&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"Gentlem, I expose to ~gib you, widout murder circum-&#xD;
loquation, a toast "-general attention was p4id; "now I&#xD;
wishes to know who owns die ere eight-hundred-dollar nig-&#xD;
ger carriage-driver, belonging to Widow Hartehorn?"&#xD;
Why, his missus     him" said tb&#xD;
(C              owns    ,       ..e outsiders all at&#xD;
once.&#xD;
"Who owns dis nigger, called Monday?" repeated&#xD;
Quash, looking triumphantly around.&#xD;
"Why, missus owns me," said Monday, getting rather&#xD;
annoyed at being made a butt.&#xD;
"Dus it is, gentlem" said Quashee, "dat de niggers&#xD;
run about in dese supersilious days, and like de poor white&#xD;
man don't know who owns him, consequentially, dis culered&#xD;
gentle am so ignoramus dat he aint awar' dat he is pre-&#xD;
possessed by de very gentle, dat is to minister de consol-&#xD;
izations of de good book to de sinners dis day."&#xD;
This significant allusion to the possible relation the&#xD;
comical-looking Monday might ~bear toward ~Mr. Goshawk,&#xD;

which might have continued apparently until now, had not&#xD;
a carriage, rapidly driven, scattered them from the imme-&#xD;

reverend gentleman, and the family of the planted~ at whose&#xD;

teners, sat Dixon, his face beaming with expectation and&#xD;
interest; he was for the moment transported back to the&#xD;
days of his boyhood innocence, the active scenes of his life&#xD;
in the long years that had since, passed had faded from his&#xD;
mind, and a future, sanctified by good resolves, alone occu-&#xD;
pied his thoughts.&#xD;
The preliminary services having been concluded, the Rev.&#xD;
Mr. Goshawk rose and stated, that he should that day found&#xD;
his sei~mon or part of the second verse of the thirteenth&#xD;
chapter of Paul's Epistle to the IRomans; " Whosoever&#xD;
therefore resist eth the rower, resisteth the ordinance of&#xD;
God."&#xD;
In his preliminary remark~, he stated that he presumed&#xD;
the institution of Slavery was most absorbing to their minds,&#xD;
and that therefore he had concluded to confine himself to its&#xD;
scripture view. That he had mor/e recently been on at the&#xD;
North, and had been compelled to have his attention~ drawn&#xD;
to the important subject, by its agitation among the people&#xD;
he had so recently visited.&#xD;
At this announcement Dixon turned fairly pale, and&#xD;
was obliged 'to disguise his excitement by leaning his head&#xD;
upon the slip before him. His next impulse was to leave&#xD;
the church, foi~ he shrunk, in his then humor, from having&#xD;
the full enormity of his crimes drawn by the powerful elo-&#xD;
quence of the preacher; but recovering himself, he deter-&#xD;
mined to receive the reproof in store for him with a peni-&#xD;
tent spirit, and as part of the penalty he had to pay, for,&#xD;
a~ he thought, "his many sins."&#xD;
"Slavery," continued Mr. Goshawk, "is the oldest in-&#xD;
stitution relating to the government of men that exists in&#xD;
&#xD;
202&#xD;
&#xD;
the world; The Jewish people, among whom it was estab-&#xD;
lished as an accessory of their civilization (by the Alniighty,&#xD;
because they were his chosen people), have politically&#xD;
passed away, but the institution remains. It was ingraft-&#xD;
ed upon the world and humanity, the moment the surging&#xD;
waters of the deluge subsided and left the dry land to ap-&#xD;
pear. For it was even then that the decree went forth&#xD;
that the' children of Ham should be bondsmen for ever; yet&#xD;
in the face of this startling truth, so intimately interwoven&#xD;
with the second creation of the world, do people professing&#xD;
to be Christians, profanely attempt to put their hand upon&#xD;
the Ark, and by their weakness would arrest the decrees&#xD;
of a just, though inscrutable Providence."&#xD;
Dixon, as these announcements one after another struck&#xD;
his ears, was perfectly overcome with astonishment. He&#xD;
rubbed his eyes, as if trying to wake up from a sound sleep&#xD;
-an expression of incredulity rested upon his face, aiid he&#xD;
looked around, as if to satisfy~ himself that. he was not&#xD;
dreaming.&#xD;
"Again I ask, if slavery were this terrible evil, would&#xD;
the men selected by our Saviour, to carry the everlasting&#xD;
gospel to the uttermost parts of the earth, allowed it to go&#xD;
uncondemned? Could these martyrs to the truth lie ch~rg-&#xD;
ed with moral cowardice? No! for men, most all of whom&#xD;
were A~in alive in defence of their cherished principles,&#xD;
could' have had no fear. The apostles, if they~had been&#xD;
anti-slavery men, would have cried aloud, where the evil&#xD;
existed, and not like these modern disorg~anizers, abused&#xD;
and vilified the slaveholder, when not only out of the way&#xD;
of all usefulness but of all responsibility.&#xD;

&#xD;
"The laws of God touching tiw subject of slavery, are&#xD;
spread as clearly through every part of the Scriptures as&#xD;
are the stars in the firmament of heaven. Human reason&#xD;
may do battle against them, but the only result will be~the&#xD;
most glaring manifestation of mortal weakness. The in-&#xD;
stitution of slavery,, from its divine origin, must continue&#xD;
so long as sin shall have a tendency to lead to death, so&#xD;
long .~s Jehovah sh~dl rule and exercise the attributes of&#xD;
mercy to fallen, degraded man.&#xD;
"If slavery," continued the preacher, "was a thing as&#xD;
bad as its ignorant enemies represent, why are the Scrip-&#xD;
tures ~o silent as to denunciations, Innumerable chapters&#xD;
can be found justifying it, regulating jt, yet no commands&#xD;
that it should not exist. In Genesis, we have a pleasing&#xD;
record of the ameliorating influence of slavery even in those&#xD;
early, times. 'Judah said unto his brethren, what profit&#xD;
is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood? Come,&#xD;
let us sell him to the Ishinaelites, and let nQt our hand be&#xD;
upon him.' 'The saving of the life of Joseph was the conse~&#xD;
quince, and following it came all the blessings that through&#xD;
him flowed toward the children of Israel. 'We are also to&#xD;
notice, brethren, that the holding of slaves, in Jacob's day,&#xD;
wa~ neither illegal nor uncommon. We are, therefore, not&#xD;
surprised that history gives us to understand, 'that in the&#xD;
golden etreets of Jerusalem were to be found the mart for&#xD;
slaves. I can imagine the patriarchs of old, as do now our&#xD;
noble planters, tracking ,for servants, and selecting with&#xD;
care those which best answered their purposes.&#xD;
"In later and more glorious days, the streets of Rome,&#xD;
and those of' every dependez~ey of that great republic swarm-&#xD;
&#xD;
ed with slaves. They were at times butchered without&#xD;
mercy, thrown to wild beasts for amusement, and were even&#xD;
used by epicures, as food for their petted fishes. Yet our&#xD;
Saviour, blessed be his name, raised not his voice against&#xD;
the institution, and the apostles exerted their influence, as&#xD;
in the case of Onesimus, to return not only runaways to&#xD;
their masters, but to frequently exhort them to be obedient&#xD;
for the glory of God.&#xD;
"What," continued 3~fr. Goshawk, "is the position of&#xD;
the slaveholder? He is the true patriarch; the parent&#xD;
of a large family; his duties are sacred; he not, only has&#xD;
the bodies but the souls of men in his keeping; he educates&#xD;
and religiously instructs his dependents; if they are sick,&#xD;
he nurses them; if naked, he clothes them;, and if borne&#xD;
down by age and infirmities provides a support a~d finds a.&#xD;
retreat for them. lYnlike the employer of the free laborer,&#xD;
his care never ceases, it does not stop the moment the re-&#xD;
cipient is no longer pecuniarily useful.&#xD;
"And here, brethren, it is forced upon me .to make&#xD;
those personal applications of our discourse, that naturally&#xD;
arise in considering this interesting theme. It is charged&#xD;
against us, that our peculiar institutions encourage 'cruelty&#xD;
to the negro. how absurd and. unchristian is this scandaL&#xD;
Imperatively, commanded by the Holy Book to buy slaves,&#xD;
we are also enjoined by the same Holy injunction, to keep&#xD;
them in obedience. The divine law shows internal evi-&#xD;
den7ce of it~ high origin, by providing for the punishment&#xD;
of slaves with rods, and asserts, that if the slave di~ iu a&#xD;
day or two after his beating, yet his owner shall not be pun-&#xD;
ished, because he can appropriate to his own usa, his zuan-&#xD;

servant or his maid-servant, and his ox, and his ass, and&#xD;
any thing that is his.&#xD;
"Are we immaculate ? are we not subject to excitements&#xD;
like unto other men? Is it wonderful, that having; by&#xD;
Providence, the~ great responsibility of slave-holding put&#xD;
upon us, that we~ should in the administration of our sacred&#xD;
office, sometimes, in moments of excitement, punish not&#xD;
more severely than the. law permits, but more than our in-&#xD;
terests justify? Moses, who was denominated the meekest&#xD;
of men, in a fit of passion threw down the hand-of-God-in-&#xD;
scribed tablets of the law; cannot, therefore, a fatal blow&#xD;
to a degraded, negro be passed by in silence? Peter, who&#xD;
was evidently of a southern disposition, of a chivalrous,&#xD;
noble temperament, in the very presence of our Saviour, on&#xD;
theimpulse of the moment, drew hi~ sword, and smote&#xD;
the servant of the high priest. That a master, provoked&#xD;
beyond endurance, should do worse to that which he owns&#xD;
and has bought with a price, should be set down to the&#xD;
amiable and redeeming traits of humanity, rather than to&#xD;
the indulgence ott improper and brutalizing passions.&#xD;
"Brethren, we are charged in the South with assisting&#xD;
in aifrays, duels, and murders. I need not say that these&#xD;
slanders need no refutation. Look at the annals of crime&#xD;
of the immaculate North -the crime of every* day,-and&#xD;
ours sink in petty incidents, compared with the enormity of&#xD;
these free people. We are ~charged with encouraging&#xD;
duelling; but when did a high standard of honor injure the&#xD;
unregenerate heart? As a clergyman, commissioned to&#xD;
preach poace and good will to all men, I condemn the&#xD;
practice; but if the grace of Go'd prevails not, better that&#xD;
&#xD;
the passions should be regulated by rules accepted of by&#xD;
the educated and refined, than be left to. riot in unre-&#xD;
strained wickedness of the natural heart.&#xD;
"We are charged with not being as good as our neigh-&#xD;
bors. Our brethren of the North have gone into the&#xD;
temple, and thanked God that they are not as other men;&#xD;
announced that they do not oppress,.-that they are given&#xD;
to alms. ~For all they have done in sincerity, Heaven be&#xD;
praised; but I will simply say, in answer to such hypocrisy,&#xD;
that our Southern piety is unobtrusive.&#xD;
"If the windy work of blowing trumpets at the corners&#xD;
of the streets,-.if vociferation, and noise, are the evi-&#xD;
dences of religion, we are lost; but Southern Christians&#xD;
'do good in secret,' that they may in~ abundant crops,&#xD;
and increasing wealth, be rewarded openly. Our minis-&#xD;
ters compare favorably for learning and zeal with, any&#xD;
North; and if we are not given to sectarian con1~roversy,&#xD;
-if there be a quiet calm in the Viarious churches in our&#xD;
midst,-we have not to blush at beholding the fanatical&#xD;
evidences of misguided and misdirected zeal. f&#xD;
"But, brethren, why dwell upon the unnecessary and&#xD;
needlessly imposed task of defending ourselves against the&#xD;
folly of fanatics and ~envy of irreligious men ~.-let us turn&#xD;
and contemplate our glorious destiny, and remember, that&#xD;
we have been singled out by Providence, 'as were the&#xD;
children of Israel in olden times, to be his peculiar people.&#xD;
The Southern Christians are chosen as the. instruments&#xD;
for the greatest and sublimest Christian revolution ever&#xD;
achieved by mortal being. When the poor African w~s&#xD;
landed on our coast, the 'slave-robbers did not know that&#xD;

their apparently evil deeds were to be made to praise God;&#xD;
yet such was verily the case. We have but to stand still&#xD;
and see ~the salvation of the Lord,~ and the glory that will&#xD;
come up out of Jerusalem.&#xD;
"In the glowing and eloquent language of a beloved&#xD;
brother, 'I feel satisfied with the tendencies of things1' I&#xD;
stand upon the mountain-peak, aboye the clouds. I&#xD;
see far beyond the storm, the calm sea, an&amp;amp; the blue sky.&#xD;
I see the Canaan of th~ African. I stand there on the&#xD;
NebQ of his exodus, and look across snot the Jordan, but&#xD;
the Atlantic.&#xD;
I: gaze as did Moses from Mount Pisgali over into&#xD;
the promised land; I see the ocean divided by a great&#xD;
wind, and piled up~ in. walls of gteen glittering glass on&#xD;
either hand; and through this crystal avenue the children&#xD;
of Ham are crossing upon dry ground,..-the' marching&#xD;

Niger, black with death, to the white man-instinct with&#xD;

all-wise and merciful Providence."&#xD;
Never, probably, was there a discourse uttered by a&#xD;
human voice, that had a more powerful effect upon an,&#xD;
auditor, than did Goshawk's upon Dixon. He had taken&#xD;
his place in the congregation an hour or two before with a&#xD;
wan face, sunken, careworn eyes, and debilitated frame;&#xD;
he now walked forth absolutely changed in his physical as&#xD;
well as moral constitution. A new light had bI~oken in'&#xD;
upon his mind; he was clay in the hands of the potter,-a&#xD;
blind instrument for doing good. He had gone to church,&#xD;
feeling that he was in the slough of despondency but was&#xD;
now conscious that, under the enlightened influences of&#xD;
"the sanctuary," his burden had rolled from off his soul;&#xD;
and in the exuberance ~f his' new view of things, he abso-&#xD;
lutely snapped his fingers over his head, and took one or&#xD;
two steps that gave promise, if their style had been con-&#xD;
tinued, that 'the spectator would have had a very good&#xD;
idea of a country jig.&#xD;
The "Head-quarters" on the morning of Mr. Gos-&#xD;
hawk's sermon had been unusually dull; as Busteed&#xD;
remarked, "The Sunday races, down at Sawyer's, always&#xD;
tuck aWay some of his customers, but the flare-up~ at 'the'&#xD;
church coming on at the same time, he was doing nothing&#xD;
at all." Even Puckett for a while deserted the popular&#xD;
resort, and walking over to the church, thrust his 'head'&#xD;
in' at the door, and got, whaV be said, was the "milk in&#xD;
the cocoanut;" and no~ waiting for the ilosiig ceremonies,&#xD;
he rushed , usteed's, and leaning&#xD;
back to B                 g over the bar,&#xD;
commenced quite an animated description of what' he had'&#xD;

heard. As Thickett proceeded, Busteed, who was busy&#xD;
wiping tumblers with a rag, startled by some assertion&#xD;
of Puckett's,' exclaimed:&#xD;
",nonsense, Goshawk didn't pile it on so thick as&#xD;
that, did he?"&#xD;
"Yes, h6 did, though," returned Puckett, emphati-&#xD;
cally; "and the parsor~' went it even a little stronger,&#xD;
for he made out Dixon and sich like to be rigler mission-&#xD;

At 'that instant Dixon stepped into the bar-roow. His&#xD;
improved appearance, and genial manner, compared with&#xD;
an hour or two before, struck both the landlord and Puck-&#xD;
'ett; the latter, unable to contain his gratification, re-&#xD;
niarked:&#xD;
"Major, you lOok better than you did this morning-&#xD;

"I am better," said Dixon, emphatically; "I've got&#xD;

CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
DEATH OF JACK.&#xD;
NEAR sunset, Toadvine left the "Head-quarters," and&#xD;
rode toward the jaiL lie was exceedingly intoxicated,&#xD;
which always made him savage; but, in addition to this,&#xD;
he had been literally swindled out of a considerable sum&#xD;
of money at~ cards,-and this fact goaded him to fury.&#xD;
The jail was situated on the suburbs of the town, and&#xD;
was reached by going over a ravine, pr, as similar obstruc-&#xD;
tions are termed, "a' wash." In ordinarily dry weather,&#xD;
there was no difficulty in crossing the ravine, but heavy&#xD;
and continuous rains had made it saddle-girth deep in&#xD;
mud; and as Toadvine attempted to rush his horse&#xD;
through the conglomerated xn~ss, the poor animal stuck&#xD;
fast,-.when, being assailed by~blows and oaths, instrug-&#xD;
gling to extricate himself he fell upon. his side, and tum-&#xD;
bled his rider "heels-over-head" in the slough. Toad-.&#xD;
vine was now furious, and as he pulled away at his hor8e'8&#xD;
bridle, he loaded the very air with his fearful impreca.&#xD;
tions. The animal; released~'of his rider's weight, reo~-&#xD;
ered his feet, and, by repeated plunges, reached the solid&#xD;
earth.&#xD;

I&#xD;
A TALE OF SOUTHERN LIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
213&#xD;
&#xD;
The negroes confined in the jail, hearing the noise,&#xD;
huddled about ~the heavy iron-grated window, and were&#xD;
highly amused at what they saw. They made many&#xD;
rough jokes at Toadvine's expense,' any one of which if. it&#xD;
had reached his ears, in his then humor, would have made&#xD;
him~ stark, staring mad. Meanwhile, the dogs within the&#xD;
picketed inolosttre of the jail commenced furiously bark-&#xD;
ing, and gnashing their teeth through the openings of the&#xD;
fenee,-'-thereby giving additional spirit to the scene.&#xD;
Toadvine hitched his horse to an old whipping-post&#xD;
near by.; and as soon as'he could reach the entrance of the&#xD;
jail, the keeper anticipated his coming by opening the&#xD;
door. Toadvine and the jailer saluted after the manner&#xD;
of old friends, and then disappeared within the precincts&#xD;
of the old 'building.&#xD;
It ~was with a great deal of difficulty that Toadvine&#xD;
could be reconciled to~ his disagreeable accident; while&#xD;
scolding about it to the jailer, he picked up a piece of&#xD;
cypress sEingle from the floor; and pettishly scraped the&#xD;
mud frQm his clothes,-.--every moment' becoming more ex-&#xD;
cited in his indignation. He abused the road inspectors,&#xD;
-~---abused the jail,-and the world generally, and Jack in&#xD;
particular and especially.&#xD;
'The jailer finally, however, reduced him to quiet, by&#xD;
producing an old stone jug from a cleft in the heavy tim-&#xD;
ber walls; 'and giving Toadvine a broken tumbler, and&#xD;
taking a gourd)iimself, ,he poured out a liberal allowance&#xD;
~t whiskey, and giving the highly original toast, "Better&#xD;
luck next time," the' twain touched "glasses" with due&#xD;
solemnity, and drank off the contents.&#xD;
&#xD;
The jailer, still. bent on' mollifying his guest, new pro-&#xD;
duced an immense plug of tobacco, and handing it to&#xD;
Toadvine, told him to take a piece, remarking, in a half&#xD;
playful way, that " that tobacker was sent him 'way from&#xD;
Oid'Virginny, by a gentleman that had two runaways in jail&#xD;
with him for near about a year.~~&#xD;
"And what the hell did he send that to you for, after&#xD;
keeping his niggers so long?" growled Toadvine, twisting&#xD;
off a large piece of' the weed.&#xD;
"Because," said the jailer, with a professional smile,&#xD;
"I sent him a paper marked around with ink, so he could&#xD;
tell whar was his property."&#xD;
"And he was from Virginny, was he?"' inquired&#xD;
Toadvine, giving his clothes a rub down with the shingle.&#xD;
"He was~," said the jailer, emphatically.&#xD;
"And a F. F. V.," snarled Toadvine, as he discovered&#xD;
a large "splotch" of mud, heretofore unperceived, over the&#xD;
calf of his leg.&#xD;
"I don't know whether he was or not," said the jailer,&#xD;
producing an old greasy playing-card. "Here," he con-&#xD;
tinued, without paying further attention to~ Toadvine, "is&#xD;
the charges agin Mr. Mildmay, for 'resting Jack;" and he&#xD;
read off the back of a playing-card as follows:&#xD;
"To Mr. Stubbs, who tuolu him up,-.-two 'for~ty-flve.,&#xD;
"Jutasses feez, for comniittin,.-.-a 'V."&#xD;
"Bored fore da~e,-.--.wun twexity; makin a sum tQt~1&#xD;
of ait dollars and seventy sents: and not much neither&#xD;
the times goze."'&#xD;
"Not much," said To~advine, taking out his cla~p~&#xD;
knife, and picking a bit of tobacco leaf from between~; '&#xD;

&#xD;
front teeth with the blade; "not much~" he repeated, as&#xD;
if in deep reflection, and then went on: "Well, maybe it&#xD;
au't; but if I had ~ nigger as run away, and cost me eight&#xD;
dollars and seventy cents, if I didn't work it out of hi~&#xD;
hide, with interest to boot, I hope I may turn nigger my-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
And the sincerity with which he made this protestation&#xD;
can be appreciated, when it is known that it closed with&#xD;
T~Qadvine's climacteric figure of speech, if he wished to&#xD;
be considered particularly in earnest.&#xD;
Toadvine now pulled out a ten dollar gold-piece, and&#xD;
giving it to the jailer, told the functionary to take his&#xD;
change;&#xD;
The jailer found some difficulty in accomplishing his&#xD;
object, a~ he had nothing but three half dollar pieces in his&#xD;
pocket. After considerable discussion, and another drink&#xD;
of ~whiskey, it was decided that Toadvine should throw&#xD;
"heads and tails" for the, piece of money in dispute-&#xD;
whereupon that gentleman took the coin, and resting it on&#xD;
the side of the fore finger of the right hand, and placing his&#xD;
thumb underneath it, he emphatically observed:&#xD;
"Now mark-heads I win, tails you lose," and then he&#xD;
sent the silver whirling in the air.&#xD;
The coin struck the floor with a ringing noise, and&#xD;
Toadvine bent over to see the result, fQr it was now get-&#xD;
ti~ dark in the jail; rising up suddenly from his stoop-&#xD;
attitude, he gave the innocent cause Qf offence a kick&#xD;
~4, his foot that sent it spinning across the floor, and then&#xD;
wit~z a great oath he swore that h&amp;amp; had "lost all day," and&#xD;
a revolver out of his pocket and examining&#xD;

the caps, he moodily told the jailer to "bring down that&#xD;
infernal nigger, for he was going home."&#xD;
Now. Jack, who had been, with his fellow~prisoners,&#xD;
very much amused, as we have already stated, at the Iloun-&#xD;
dering~ of Toadvine in the mire, was perfectly unconscious&#xD;
that it was the overseer, and it was not until some time&#xD;
after, when he recognized the horse hitched in front of the&#xD;
jail, that the whole truth flashed upon him.&#xD;
In an instant he seemed to, comprehend his situation,&#xD;
and uttering the exclamation, "Oh Mister I what will be-&#xD;
come of poor Jack now?" he sunkAown upon the floor&#xD;
4'&#xD;
the very picture of despair.&#xD;
"And what's de matter~ wid you, Jack?" inquired his&#xD;
humble friends in bondage.&#xD;
"Oh Lord! oh Lord!" said the poor fellow, 'wringing&#xD;
his hands, "it's Mr. Toadvine date come for m~., He's de&#xD;
man as druv me from home,-he's de man dat got my wife,&#xD;
away,-.--.he's de man as will kill me ~yet;" and again Jack&#xD;
buried his head between his knees, and th~ tears rained&#xD;

The sympathy for Jack, expressed by his fellow~prison-&#xD;

the full force of their companion's' situation, and~ too igno-&#xD;

around him in silent agony, in which position they remain-&#xD;

until th~'k~ees of the boy gave way from fear, and he sank&#xD;
upon Lhe~floor.'&#xD;
"Noue of your skulking," fairlyroared Toadvine; "none&#xD;
of your gammoning me, you 'infernal black sop. So you&#xD;
run away, did you, 'cause you couldn't bear to have me&#xD;
whip you? That's for treating you like a lamb. "But,"&#xD;
he continued, growing white with anger, "Ill cure you of&#xD;

had evidently been originally used for packing Springfield&#xD;

he handed it to Toadvine, who, without any apparent con-&#xD;
sideration as to the length he wanted, cut off a piece and&#xD;
gave the remainder back to the jailer; then toppingg up&#xD;
to Jack, he struck him .a severe blow with th~ cord across&#xD;
his shoulders, and ordering him to hold up his head, corn-i&#xD;
menaced tying the boy around the neck.&#xD;
"What are you going to do?" inquired the jailer,&#xD;
with some little surprise.&#xD;
"Take this feller home~; any thing to say agin it?" said&#xD;
Toadvine, the very act of touching Jack's neck inflamiiig&#xD;
still more his tiger passions.&#xD;
"Nothing more,"' said the jailer, '~placing his hand on&#xD;
the large bowie-knife he carried in his breast, and eyeing&#xD;
Toadvine with hostile meaning; "Nothing more-4nly&#xD;
'civil tongues is best for health,' and I think you'd better t~&#xD;
that boy with his elders behind him, instead of 'round th~&#xD;
neck."&#xD;
Toadvine was cowed, but again feeling disposed to give&#xD;
way to his passion, which, suppressed against the jailer,&#xD;
burst with increased fury upon the ~head of the victim now&#xD;
so completely in his power.&#xD;
"I think," said Toadvine, leading the boy awax and&#xD;
measuring the effect of" his words, "I thitAkI understand&#xD;
my business with ~niggers."&#xD;
"Well, .1 'spect you do," replied the jailer, closing&#xD;
door on Toadvine and 'Jack, and then locking it on the&#xD;

Toadvine once- out - of doers, drove Jack ahead of him&#xD;
while still holding him fast by the rope, and thus the two&#xD;
proceeded until the boy reached the overseer's horse, Which&#xD;
he respectfully. held until the man mounted. Toad vine&#xD;
then fastened the end of the rope in his hand to the poni-&#xD;
mel of the Spanish saddle, and with the quickness of&#xD;
thought gave his horse the spurs.&#xD;
The animal jumped, and had it not been that Jack was&#xD;
still at his head, would in that spring probably have broken&#xD;
the boy's neck; as it was it nearly threw him to the ground,&#xD;
but -he recovered himself and leaping forward kept by the&#xD;
side of the rider. In another moment, Toadvine was again&#xD;
floundering in the 'wash.' Jack instantly seized the horse's&#xD;
head, and by i~ain strength pulled him through. The mo-&#xD;
ment that Toadvine felt the solid earth, he again spurred&#xD;
on the animal, and in the haze of the evening he was re-&#xD;
cognized as he passed through the streets of Beechland,&#xD;
going at a killing pace, with a negro boy almost undistin-&#xD;
guishable jn the gloom, following close in his rear.&#xD;

-   THE EXCITEMENT OF TIlE HOUR.&#xD;
O~ the morning following Toadvine's visit to the jail, the&#xD;
citizens living in the neighborhood of ]3eeohland, were&#xD;
shocked by discovering on the very edge Qf the town, the&#xD;
mutilated body of a dead negro, and it seemed more than&#xD;
probable that a murder had b-een committed. The neck&#xD;
of the deceased was not only broken, but' the bones thei~eof&#xD;
had evidently been torn asunder; and with such force, as&#xD;
to elongate the persistent- muscles. A piece of rope that&#xD;
had evidently been rudely severed with a sharp knife, was&#xD;
still around h~s neck, and upon farther examination, a deep&#xD;
indentation could be traced for a conside~.able distance,&#xD;
along the road, showing how far the body had~been drng~ed&#xD;
upon the ground.&#xD;
It, happened to be that day of the w~k, when the&#xD;
planters of the vicinity, by general consent, meet in tOWZk~ ~--4&#xD;
not only to transact business, but also for social - inter-&#xD;
course, and very soon- a laz~ge number of the most substan-&#xD;

220            THE MASTEB75 HoPsi;&#xD;
excited groups in proximitY to the body, and all engaged&#xD;
in deep and earnest conversation about the mystery.&#xD;
The "coroner" had been summoned a jury was quickly&#xD;
obtained-an incj~iest held-and the prompt verdict was,&#xD;
that the deceased negro came to his death by violence&#xD;
at the hands of some person or personS i~nknowfl.&#xD;
This done, the body was taken to the court-house, and&#xD;
laid out upon the porch, in hopes that some one would.&#xD;
identify it.&#xD;
About ten o'clock, the jailer had fInished his morning&#xD;
work, of letting the negroes get their own breakfast, while&#xD;
he fed his dogs, with ~such other duties as occurred, when&#xD;
he thrust a cigar in his mouth, and his hands in his&#xD;
pockets, and leaving his charge in ~* care of a deputy,&#xD;
he started out to learn the newS of tE6 day, and prepared&#xD;
to take an active part An a political discussion, or a game&#xD;
of ~card~, the only two excitements he allowed himself&#xD;
openly tQ indulge in.&#xD;
And it so happened as he passed along, that he came&#xD;
across a group of citizens in deep and earnest conversation&#xD;
and he knew at once that something more than usual "was&#xD;
in the wind."&#xD;
"There goes Orcutt the jailer," said Gen. flledsoe, the&#xD;
most popular and influential man in the community; and&#xD;
continued he, "Orcutt is well acquainted in town, and per-&#xD;
haps he might give us some clew to thi5 strange matxt&amp;amp;r,"&#xD;
~nd with~the universal approval of all present, Orcutt was&#xD;
calledd intq the conferetYce.&#xD;
This notice pleased the jailer, and~ as he came toward&#xD;
the group, he decided in hi8 own ~niiad that they were&#xD;

going to ask him, either if he hadn't a pleasant room in&#xD;
the jail where a game of ' brag' could be played, or else,&#xD;
that ~e would go over to the head-quarters and 'take a&#xD;
drink, and he couldn't tell which-but he 'determined to be&#xD;
affable, in either case.&#xD;
"' Orcutt," said Gen. I3ledsoe, after the salutations of&#xD;
meeting were over,, "we called you over here, to ask what&#xD;
you think of this murder that' was committed last night?"&#xD;
"Haven't heard a word of it," said Orcutt, his suspi-&#xD;
cions however prompting him to believe that he knew all&#xD;
the history.&#xD;
"You haven't heard of it 1" exclaimed two or three&#xD;
voices at once; "why, what have you been doing this morn-&#xD;
ing?"&#xD;
"Nothing but looking after the' stone jug,"' said Oreutt,&#xD;
with a sort of injured look, "nothing else."&#xD;
"The fact is," continued Gen. Bledsoe, "a negro boy was&#xD;
killed h~st night just a few hundred yards from the jail "-.&#xD;
"Up the old bayou road "-involuntarily suggested&#xD;
Orcutt.&#xD;
"The same," said the general, exchanging glances&#xD;
of intelligence with the gentlemen in the ~rowd.&#xD;
"Well, let me ~e the body," said the jailer, who in-&#xD;
stantly became an object of suspicious interest, and the&#xD;
party walked towards the court-house..&#xD;
"The body of Jack, as~~we have stated, had been laid~&#xD;
upon the court-house steps. An ,infirm oId negro, who~had,~'&#xD;

of it in a decent manner, had covered it with a sheet, and&#xD;
sat by, a~ sincere m9urner for the memory and misfortunes&#xD;
of one of her race.&#xD;
"And who is it, aunty?" said Gen. ]3ledsoe, addressing&#xD;
the old negress kindly, "do you know the face?"&#xD;
'KBress you, no, master;" and turning to the corpse, she&#xD;
muttered, "he's done gone to heaven now, dat's. one com~&#xD;
fort," and then instinctively moved away from the imme-&#xD;
diate presence of~the white people.&#xD;
Orcutt -was exceedingly annoyed that, by an unguarded&#xD;
expression,, he had made , his suspicions a matter of inter-&#xD;
es~, for he did not wish to have the responsibility of recog-&#xD;
nizing the body, and probable arrest of the murderer,&#xD;
thrown upon his shoulders. Holding his office at the&#xD;
mercy of political partisan~, it instantly occurred to him,&#xD;
that the enmity of Toadvine and his friends, if united at&#xD;
any future-time against him at the poiis, could secure his&#xD;
removal, and he ~was exceedingly embarrassed at the posi-&#xD;
tion in -which he found himself.&#xD;
Now the usually most talkative man in the community&#xD;
was in the crowd, but from the time he heard of the mur-&#xD;
der, he had been as dumb as a mouse.' This gentleman&#xD;
was Maj. Trimmer, "the great criminal lawyer and active&#xD;
politician" of the surrounding country; he knew that he&#xD;
had a client somewhere in the parish, as soon as he saw&#xD;
Jack's body, and was then actually looking -out for his&#xD;
"retaining fee."&#xD;
- - lie discovered Orcutt's embarrassment, and tucking&#xD;
that worthy under the arm, he led him a step aside, and&#xD;
&#xD;
remarked, "You needn't say any thing to crilninate your-&#xD;
self, even if such a thing were possible."&#xD;
"I'd nothing to do with it," said Orcutt doggedly, "but&#xD;
you'll give me a letter major, in case it is ever necessary,&#xD;
that what I do say is under compulsion. - -&#xD;
"Certainly I will," said the major, shaking Orcutt&#xD;
by the hand.&#xD;
Orcutt returned to the group of inquirers, and care-&#xD;
lessly throwing back the old sheet from the face of the&#xD;
corpse, examined the swollen and ghastly lineaments for a&#xD;
moment, and said&#xD;
"As I expected, its -~" but before he could say&#xD;
more, Gen. Bledsoe suddenly seized him by the shoulder,&#xD;
and with great emphasis exclaimed:&#xD;
"You know tjie negro, and you believe he wa~ mur-&#xD;
dered?" - Orcutt was about to resist such rude treatment,&#xD;
but the eyes of too many resolute men were upon him, who&#xD;
evidently sympathized with the general's conduct,&#xD;
"I think I know the negro, and I believe that he was&#xD;
killed," said Orcutt, looking confused.&#xD;
"And why did you ask if the - murder was committed&#xD;
in the bayou road, when you claimed to have heard nothing&#xD;
about it," asked a very matter of fact planted', thru8ting&#xD;
his nose into Orcutt's face.&#xD;
"Don't speak as you value life," -whispered- Bledsoe,&#xD;
becoming every moment more excited, "don~t speak until&#xD;
I tell&#xD;

instantly surrounded by the most influential persons -pre-&#xD;

&#xD;
bowie-knives and pistols; and this significant group, by a&#xD;
kind of tacit consent, no one but the initiated approached.&#xD;
The news spread that a clew tQ the murder had been&#xD;
obtained, and crowds began 'to collect about the court-&#xD;
house; men, and boys, and negroes, cQuld be seen coming&#xD;
from every direction to the common focus, all excited and&#xD;
all curious. The keeper of the" ilead-quarters" adjoining&#xD;
the seat of justice, was in ecstasies, and this was displayed&#xD;
in a professional way, for, rushing behind his bar, he com-&#xD;
menced cleaning his glasses, feeling assured that very soon&#xD;
his "groceries" would be in even unusual demand.&#xD;
"And now, Mr. Orcutt," said Gen. Bledsoe, looking at&#xD;
his compeers, and letting go his hold on the jailer, "now,&#xD;
sir, we will hear your story.&#xD;
Without ceremony, Orcutt gave a very truthful account&#xD;
of things connected with Jack's leaving the jail; as he&#xD;
progressed with his story, many of his listeners became&#xD;
livid with rage, and deep and bitter were the subdued exe-&#xD;
orations that fell upon Toadvine's head.&#xD;
Orcutt soon discovered how popular feeling was going,&#xD;
and he began to artfully exaggerate things already dreadful&#xD;
he felt that Toadvine's power had gone, and therefore, to&#xD;
conciliate the influence of the overseer was no longer' a&#xD;
matter of importance.&#xD;
As soon as the full force of Toadvine 's conduct was un-&#xD;
derstood, there was a universal clamor for his arrest and&#xD;
prompt punishment. The feeling was more than i~sually&#xD;
strong, from the fact, that recently two or three slave murders&#xD;
had been committed, only a little lees atrocious than the case&#xD;
under consideration; and in truth, so great was the excite-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
ment, that there was evidently a strong under-current, de-&#xD;
manding more summary proceedings than could be had by&#xD;
due course of law. Many persons whispered apart-.Gen.&#xD;
Bledsoe was constantly consulted; individuals would leave&#xD;
the select throng, and go over to the court-house group,&#xD;
and whispering tc~ different men, of repulsive and hang-dog&#xD;
appearance, lead them within the centre of the delibera-&#xD;
tive body; men, whose long beards and dissipated faces&#xD;
marked them as "the desperadoes of the community?'&#xD;
Every now and then some one would; after being whis-&#xD;
pered to by Gen. Bledsoe, leave, and presently return&#xD;
with a double-barrelled fowling-piece or musket. The&#xD;
sheriff also made his appearance, and was uncon~monly ac- -&#xD;
tive to find some justice of the peace, to get out a warrant,&#xD;
for he regretted that he could do nothing, "unless espe-&#xD;
cially instructed by a proper officer."&#xD;
It was soon evident that one universal feeling had set-&#xD;
tled down upon the .rowd. Some three or four who had&#xD;
been active in the deliberations, were already mounted, as&#xD;
if bent on a hasty journey, when one of the younger men&#xD;
of the party rose in his saddle, and speaking in a loud&#xD;
voice, said:&#xD;
"Gentlemen, we have had to-day the painful evidence&#xD;
of the reckless destruction of our property. If irrespon-&#xD;
sible men are permitted to thus injure our interests, what&#xD;
will be the result? utter ruin. It is proposed that the&#xD;
violator of our rights, in consideration of his seeming de-&#xD;
fiance of the laws, 'be not left to the mercy of. its delay,&#xD;
but have justice dealt out to him with our own indignant&#xD;
hands."                                             A&#xD;

THE MA5TER~5 HOUSE;&#xD;
&#xD;
A loud and enthusiastic shout was given, and twenty&#xD;
men in an instant were in their saddles.. Away these&#xD;
horsemen scattered through the streets, many riding hither&#xD;
and thither, and almost all indulging in the* free use of&#xD;
liquor, either from canteens carried in their pockets, or&#xD;
such as could be purchased at the "groceries." In the&#xD;
course of a half hour more, the town had assumed its&#xD;
usually dull appearance, for that particular time of day.&#xD;
On that eventful morning, Toadvine had risen at his&#xD;
accustomed hour, and externally, as if nothing in his his-&#xD;
tory of an extraordinary character had occurred, he went&#xD;
into the field with the negroes. After he returned to his&#xD;
house for his breakfast, he quietly walked over to the&#xD;
"residence," and asked Mr. Mildmay for a prospective&#xD;
order for the amount of money due him up to date, re-&#xD;
marking, "that he had created some debts, which he&#xD;
wished to settle;" he then strolled out upon the gallery,&#xD;
and taking up an old newspaper, seemed to be absorbed in&#xD;
its contents.&#xD;
Mildmay, after looking over his memorandum book,&#xD;
wrote a draft on his merchant for the amount due Toad-&#xD;
vine, and stepping out on the gallery, handed it to the&#xD;
overseer, with the question, "Did you bring home Jack,&#xD;
last night, as you intended?"&#xD;
"Why, the fact is," said Toadvine, folding up the pa-&#xD;
per and putting it in his pocket-" the fact is, that I spent&#xD;
too niuch time, yesterday evening, at the 'Ilead-quBrliers,'&#xD;
and besides losing some money, I drank too much-" and&#xD;
Toadvine apparently hesitated to finish his remark.&#xD;
"I am sorry, for your sake, that such is the fact I"&#xD;
&#xD;
observed Mildmay, with perceptible emotion in his voice;&#xD;
"but no matter," he continued, evidently not desirous to&#xD;
seem to assume any superiority in habits or position; "no&#xD;
matter, I am going to Beechland this evening, myself and&#xD;
I will call at the jail, and send Jack home, and thus have&#xD;
no further trouble about it."&#xD;
Toadvine moved away, crossed the yard, and entered&#xD;
his own house, and sitting down at his deal table, and&#xD;
taking a deep rotation of his ever favorite whiskey, and&#xD;
thrusting his hands in his pockets, he commenced solilo-&#xD;
quizing, thus:&#xD;
"I wonder what did become of Jack? I must have&#xD;
been pretty tight last night. I was so infarnally ma~i&#xD;
about that mud-hole, that I 'most forget every thing else.&#xD;
low lie did pull, when he tried to get away; if it hadn't&#xD;
been for breaking off the pommel of my saddle, to say&#xD;
nothing of that rope across my thigh, I'd a' pulled him&#xD;
home, or killed my horse."&#xD;
And giving utterance to these expressions, Toadvine,&#xD;
for some ten minutes, seemed lost in a deep reverie, then&#xD;
rousing himself, he put away his decanter, and looked&#xD;
over the "promise to pay," so recently received from his&#xD;
employer, and after cyphering some time on the floor with&#xD;
a piece of charcoal, he observed:&#xD;
"Well, if Mr. Mildinay does send me off for this lit-&#xD;
tle frolic, he don't owe me any thing, thank fortune!" and&#xD;
with this consoling reflection, and entirely unconscious of&#xD;
the real extent of his offending, he mounted his. hors~,,aitd&#xD;
again rod~ into the field.&#xD;

Here in conclave it was agreed, that it was ttseless to&#xD;
trust~ to the laws for the punishment of Toadvine; that the&#xD;
law was a mere farce, gotten up for no other purpose than&#xD;
to enable lawyers to rob the conmiunity, and escape the&#xD;
consequences. It was further decided,~that it would save&#xD;
the parish expense, and a great deal of feeling besides, in&#xD;
the minds of those interested, by seeing him summarily&#xD;
hung to a limb of the nearest tree; and also teach him,&#xD;
and others similarly disposed to tamper with the rights of&#xD;
the planters, that it could not be done with impunity.&#xD;

CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
THE RESCUE.&#xD;
AN hour's riding brought the party near the "Heritage&#xD;
Place;" the young men rode ahead to reconnoitre, and&#xD;
one soon returned and reported, to the astonishment of&#xD;
every one, that Toadvine was actually in the field; and&#xD;
that by leaving the main road, threadingadeep, but tiot&#xD;
impassable sluiceway, he could be easily cut off from all&#xD;
connection with the house, and if he attempted 'escape af-&#xD;
ter he discovered that he was to be arrested, he would&#xD;
have to take to the woods, when "he could be run down&#xD;
at leisure."&#xD;
Gen. Bled~oe at once decided upon taking advantage&#xD;
of the opportunity thus unexpectedly offered, to make an&#xD;
easy capture, and in another instant the horsemen were&#xD;
galloping to their several assigned places, distributing&#xD;
themselves so that Toadvine had no other way of escape&#xD;
than by striking into the fastnesses 'of the swamp.&#xD;
The doomed man soon discovered that there were ~per~&#xD;
sons in his vicinity, but still remained unconscious of his&#xD;

when further attracted by moving forms through the dis-&#xD;

of armed men were in pursuit of him~&#xD;
Rushing to his horse, that was cropping grass by the&#xD;
edges of one of the field roads, he leaped upon his back,&#xD;
and, as if Mildmay was most likely to now befriend him, he&#xD;
tirpued the animal's head towards Heritage Place; but&#xD;
before he had rode many yards he was hailed to stop-.-.&#xD;
turning suddenly, he went headlong down the field, when&#xD;
again he discovered that the fowling-pieces bore directly&#xD;
upon him; desperate, and alarmed for his life, he now&#xD;
turned his hor~e's head, as Bledsoe had anticipated, to-&#xD;
ward the swamp, and fairly flew, with speed; accelerated&#xD;
no doubt, by a number of curs belonging to the negroes,&#xD;
barking and howling at hi~ rear; with a bound he cleared&#xD;
the fence, and knowing the country well, it seemed as if&#xD;
he w~uld escape, so rapidly did he disappear amid the rich&#xD;
mellow gloom.&#xD;
But Toadvine had those upon his track, who knew the&#xD;
swamp even better than himself,-persons who had, for&#xD;
years, pursued the deer and wild cat, through the very&#xD;
labyrinth he wa8 then threading; and those persons, con-.&#xD;
scious of their power, rode even leisurely. along, knowing&#xD;
that he must, almost without an effort, soon fall into their&#xD;
hands.&#xD;
Mildmay, from 'the time that Toadvine left him, had&#xD;
been engaged in looking over papers, brought to his recol-&#xD;

election by opening his memorandum book, and he was,&#xD;
while listening to the unusual noise of the dogs barking in&#xD;
the field, startled by the appearance of Wash, who, with&#xD;
distended eyes, announced to his master "dat a big party&#xD;
of gentle was hunting down in de new ground."&#xD;
Mildmay, from an upper gallery, glanced over the*&#xD;
field, just in time to see Toadvine's fearful leap, and as he&#xD;
discovered the armed men follow in pursuit, he was in-&#xD;
stantly impressed with the belief that something serious-u&#xD;
had happened.&#xD;
Without betraying his excitement, he ordered Wash to&#xD;
saddle his horse, that he might ride down and see what&#xD;
was going on. It was with difficulty that he could repress&#xD;
his impatience until the boy arrived with his steed, and&#xD;
still more was it painful to retain an ambling pace, when&#xD;
he described that Annie's affectionate eyes were bent upon&#xD;
him. But once relieved of all necessity for restraint, he&#xD;
put spurs to his hOrse, and 'followed swiftly on the new-&#xD;
made trail.&#xD;
In the meanwhile, it would seem that Gen. Bledsoe's&#xD;
party crossed the diameter &amp;amp;f the circle made by Toad'~ine,&#xD;
in his ignorance of the ground he was going over, and ere&#xD;
the pursued was aWare of it, he Was surrounded. A dozen&#xD;
"shots" had sight upon him at once, and he was comrnan&amp;amp;&#xD;
ed to stop, and reining up his horse, he sat in his saddle a&#xD;
perfect picture of blank despair.&#xD;
The pursuers rushed upon him, and checked their ex-&#xD;
cited horses so close to his person, that his hair was fanned&#xD;
by the distended nostrils of their foaming. steeds.&#xD;
"Dismount, you wretch!" cried Bledsoe,-as he kept his&#xD;

spirited horse by main force to the ground, "dismount, I&#xD;
say; we have~a better way to serve your carcass than to&#xD;
let it hang across a Spanish saddle."&#xD;
To Toadvine, the command seemed to cause the world                                ,~ ~.,&#xD;
to be passing away as a sheet of fire. lie knew that he was&#xD;
guilty of some crime, but the uncertainty of its extent&#xD;
magnified his fears, and he felt as if an awful judgment was&#xD;
upon him. Looking around, he saw faces familiar in ap-                           [Cj~IT2TKy~: ~&#xD;
pearance, yet glaring upon him with strange and intense&#xD;
passion; a confused ringing sound passed through his brain,&#xD;
and fainting, he fell from his horse.&#xD;
flefore, however, he reached the ground, he was in the&#xD;
arms of one of the men, and by the time he recovered his&#xD;
nses, the rope that had deprived poor Jack of his life,&#xD;
was around another victim's neck.                                                      7&#xD;
Toadvine, the instant he felt the cord, comprehended                       ,4k~~jt&#xD;
his fate, and uttered one long, loud shriek for mercy; but&#xD;
ere he could have repeated tha1~ heart-rending cry, the power&#xD;
to do so would have been at an end for ever, had not Mild-&#xD;
may, glowing with excitement, rushed into the ring; cheek-&#xD;
ing his speed so abruptly, that his horse's 'hoofs ~loughed&#xD;
their way deeply into the virgin soil.&#xD;
Dark and lowering looks were turned upon the intruder,&#xD;
which instaiitly~ cleared away, as senie one exclaimed,&#xD;
"Mildmay, by the gods!"&#xD;
This name electrified with sudden life the sinking and                     ~&#xD;
terror-stricken Toadvine, who frantically seized Mild~nay's&#xD;
feet, and begged him for the love of God, to interfere and&#xD;
save his life.&#xD;

&#xD;
raised, and turning instinctively towards Gen. Bledsoo,&#xD;
whom he did not know, he begged to be informed as to the&#xD;
meaning of 4he scene enacted before i~im.&#xD;
The fact that Toadvine was Mildxnay's overseer, and&#xD;
that it was Mildmay's wrongs the party was professedly&#xD;
about to redress, caused his unannounced and unexpected&#xD;
presence to be greeted with a respect that might, under&#xD;
other circumstances, with persons so excited, Jiave been&#xD;
attended with a different result.&#xD;
Gen. Blcdsoe, in a few and hastily-delivered words, ex-&#xD;
plained the outrage.&#xD;
"And Jack is dead?" said Mildmay, snapping his eyes&#xD;
as if awaking from a sleep.&#xD;
"Yes, dead!" said Bledsoe, "and murdered by that&#xD;
skulking wretch who is hanging at your heeL"&#xD;
"A shame and an outrage!" said Mildmay, his face&#xD;
darkening, as he kicked himself loose from the overseer's&#xD;
grasp.&#xD;
"A shame indeed," said Gen. ]3ledsoe, his face burning&#xD;
with excitement, "and that he may not serve others so,&#xD;
tuck him up boys, and let the buzz~ds have, their rights."&#xD;
"You would not hang this man," said Nildmay, leap~&#xD;
ing from his horse, and literally throwing himself as a&#xD;
shield over Toadvine's prostrate form. "You would not&#xD;
hang this man. I~et me beg of you, gentlemen, that the&#xD;
laws have their sway; let my injury go unredressed, rather&#xD;
than tarnish our honor with so great a wrong as this."&#xD;
"The laws be d..-.-.d," said a fellow, in an Arkansas&#xD;
blanket coat, seizing hold of Toadvine's shoulder. "If&#xD;
you've got nothing mit the law to reach this 'ere gentleman&#xD;

with, hes as good as clear to-day; ain't he, Gineral Bled-&#xD;
At the mention of this name,~ Mildma~y turned toward&#xD;
the person addressed and said:&#xD;
"General J3ledsoe, for such I understand you to be,&#xD;
permit me to beg as a personal favor, that you will leave&#xD;
this man iu the hands of the law. The case is too plain&#xD;
to fear that he will escape the penalty due his crime, and&#xD;
to the extent of the law, will I see that he is prosecuted&#xD;
and punished."&#xD;
"What say you, gentlemen?" asked Bledsoe, looking&#xD;
around upon the group of excited faces-and after scanning&#xD;
them for a moment, he said, with a graceful wave of the&#xD;
hand:&#xD;
"Mr. Mildmay, that creature is your prisoner.~~&#xD;
At this announcement, the spectators fairly rocked to&#xD;
and fro with the sudden reaction of their moral feelings,&#xD;
and Toadvine fell to the earth as if struck by the hand of&#xD;
death.&#xD;
." Well, he's made a~ die of it, any how," said the owner&#xD;
of the green blanket coat, looking at Toadvine with coini-&#xD;
cal pity, and loosening the cord about his neck,-." but&#xD;
maybe," the fellow continued, "this will bring him too,"&#xD;
and with the most affecting attention, he took his whiskey&#xD;
bottle from his pocket and held it to Toadvine's nostrils.&#xD;
"You see," said General Bledsoe, looking at Mildmay,&#xD;
and playfully pointing at the rough Samaritan before him,&#xD;
"you see that Ben Puckett isn't so bad a man after all,&#xD;
although he has a poor opinion of the laws."&#xD;
Mildmay forced a sickly smile, and asked, directing his&#xD;
&#xD;
285&#xD;
&#xD;
eye to Bledsoe, "if he could get Mr. P~ckett to take the&#xD;
prisoner to the jail at Beechland, if he were paid liberally&#xD;
for the trouble?"&#xD;
"Certainly you can," said the general with vivacity,&#xD;
and I will be responsible that Puckett will never let him&#xD;
go until he has the jailer's receipt in full for the amiable&#xD;
gentleman."&#xD;
"I'll go to jail," said Toadvine with a humble voice,&#xD;
and absolutely grown wan and pallid with the terror he had&#xD;
undergone.&#xD;
Of course, you will," said Puckett, while tying Toad.&#xD;
vine's elbows behind him,-." of course you will; ain't I&#xD;
promised to take you?" and Puckett laughed at his own&#xD;
humor.&#xD;
The crowd now dispersed. All left evidently satisfied,&#xD;
for you could hear the merry, ringing laugh of different in-&#xD;
dividuals, expressive of a consciousness of being relieved&#xD;
from a fearful responsibility.&#xD;
Toadvine, once on his way, soon arrived at Beeehland&#xD;
jail, lie managed, in the course of conversation along the&#xD;
road, to secure Puckett's friendship, but could not over-&#xD;
come the sturdy Kentuckian's innate sense of honor suffi-&#xD;
cient to induce him to let his prisoner go, as was suggested&#xD;
under the plea of "accidental escape." Puckett was too&#xD;
powerful as a man, to make it probable, that he could be mas-&#xD;
tered in a scuffle, and too ambitious mentally, to be willing&#xD;
to have it reported that hew~as outwitted, when placed iwa&#xD;
responsible position.&#xD;
"And what do you 'spose," said Toadvine to Puck-&#xD;

they make such a fuss ~ahout the' killing of Jack for, any&#xD;
how?"&#xD;
"'Cause you didn't ow'~ him," said Puckett with a pa-&#xD;
tronizing manner.&#xD;
*" Perhaps that was it," replied Toad'vine, still as if in&#xD;
a dream, and riding a short distance he resumed: "I never&#xD;
heard such a fuss about killing a nigger before. Thar&#xD;
was Bill Stiger down at the 'Oaks' who' chopped a darkee&#xD;
into pieces with a cane knife, and bragged on it afterwards,&#xD;
and he was never touched."&#xD;
"And didn't the Grand Jury find a bill ?" inquired&#xD;
Puckett.&#xD;
"No," sai4 Toadvine emphatically, "Stiger run off&#xD;
the sheriff with a double barrel, and swore he would shoot&#xD;
any juror that dar'd indite him."&#xD;
"And the matter ended thar, did it ~" inquired Puckett&#xD;
with solemnity.&#xD;
"Of course it ended," said Toadvine, overflowing with&#xD;
a sense of' his own unjust treatment-'~ of course it ended,&#xD;
and Stiger could have gone to the Legislature the next&#xD;
'leetion, only he wouldn't."&#xD;
"Well, it's too bad," said Puckett with a sympathetic&#xD;
voice, "that they treat you so; but no matter, Toady,"&#xD;
sai4 he playfully, "Buss', Orcutt, and I, ~will come up&#xD;
in your room and play 'poker' and 'seven up,' and you&#xD;
shan't want for friends, you know-and we'll have a real&#xD;
good time of it, and no mistake."&#xD;
With this assurance, Toadvine, who was unaccountably&#xD;
depressed in spirits, when left to his own reflections,&#xD;
brightened up, and saw that lying' in jail a few weeks wasut&#xD;
&#xD;
so bad after all; while, like many other men in a sim-&#xD;
ilar situation, lie began to realize a kind of satisfaction in&#xD;
the prospect he had before him, of becoming an object of&#xD;
real attentiQil to the crowd about the court-house.&#xD;
Upon arriving at the suburbs of Beechland, Puckett&#xD;
relieved Toadvine of the hated rope that had heretofore&#xD;
bound his elbows, the prisoner solemnly promising not to&#xD;
attempt to get away, and Puckett threatening to split Toad-&#xD;
vine's head open, if he did forfeit his honor by any such&#xD;
performance; "for you see," said Puekett, opening for the&#xD;
last time the knots in the cord,-" you see, Toady,~ I gave&#xD;
my word to General Bledsoe, that I would take you to jail,&#xD;
and I must do it if I help you out agin at sundown."&#xD;
The ever busy Orcutt answered the first knock at the&#xD;
jail door, and he started back with some surprise at seeing&#xD;
Toadvine safe and sound before him :~-'~ Why, I thought&#xD;
you went off this morning, " said the jailer, unconscious of&#xD;
the severity of his allusion:'&#xD;
"But he didn't, though," said Puckett mysteriously,&#xD;
"though he was at the 'went off place,' wasn't you, Toady."&#xD;
The jests were too suggestive to the Qverseer of the dark&#xD;
side of his situation, and with a pallor upon his cheek, he&#xD;
requested to be shown to his room, saying that he "felt&#xD;
sick, and wanted rest.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
U1~InXPECTED REtATIONSHIP&#xD;
Tms~ instant that Toadvine disappeared, and with him the&#xD;
different persons who had been so recently engaged in his&#xD;
pursuit, Geueral Bledsoe turned to Mildmay, and showed&#xD;
by his maimer a desire to enter into familiar conversation.&#xD;
The two gentlemen consequently rode out of "the swamp,"&#xD;
side by~ side, and. so continued in the open fields, as their&#xD;
road necessarily led toward heritage Place. Nfildmay was&#xD;
himself highly delighted ivith General ]3ledsoe, and as he&#xD;
had always heard him spoken of as one of the most influ-&#xD;
ential persons in the surrounding neighborhood, Graham&#xD;
f~lV more-than ordinary pleasure that a mutual friendship&#xD;
promised to be the result of a most singular introduction.&#xD;
Long beforethe two had reached the heritage, all the&#xD;
particulars of Toadyine's conduct had been discussed and&#xD;
commtrnted upon, aud had given way to more pleasing sub-&#xD;
jects, and General. ]3I~Isoe had, with exceeding fran1~iies5,&#xD;
accepted an invitation to make a call at the house and tar-&#xD;
take of some slight refreshment% before he pursued his way&#xD;
homeward.&#xD;
&#xD;
As the gentlemen dismounted, Wash took the horses&#xD;
and they proceeded on through the lawn. Annie was walk-&#xD;
'jug on~the upper gallery, and as Mildmay looked up auad&#xD;
greeted her with a smile, General J3ledsoe instinctively&#xD;
turned his eye also upward, and unexpectedly seeing a&#xD;
lady, raised his hat and passed uncovered into ~he house.&#xD;
Wash soon made his appearance, and armed with water&#xD;
and a snowy napkin, he presented them to the general,&#xD;
who, quietly removing his gloves, laved. his hands, while&#xD;
Mildmay performed the same pleasant office in his own&#xD;
room.&#xD;
When Graham returned to his guest, he was followed&#xD;
by Wash carrying a salver, on which were two or three&#xD;
kinds of choice liqueurs, and a box of superior cigars. The&#xD;
two gentlemen simply went through the ceremony of&#xD;
drinking,, when Gen. Bledsoe set down his glass, and&#xD;
taking another, and filling it with cool water, he drank it&#xD;
off with evident satisfaction;.. and then throwing himself&#xD;
into an easy chair, with Mildmay most comfortably dish.&#xD;
posed of, directly eppoaite to him, cigars were selected&#xD;
and lighted; and after a few moments' silence, thw general,&#xD;
slowly blowing the smoke from his mouth, turned toMild..&#xD;
may, and observed:&#xD;
"From your given name, Mr. Mildmay, II judge that&#xD;
you are from the 'Old North ~$tate 1~",&#xD;
"such is the fact," replied Mildn~xay, rousing himself&#xD;
into an attitude. of interest.&#xD;
"Yet I think," contiuned the g9ueraliu amusing&#xD;
manner, "~that Mildmay is not a North Carolina n~iue?"&#xD;
"It is not," said Mild~nay; "while my mother's f&amp;amp;n-&#xD;

&#xD;
ily name is very common, perhaps, there is not one of my&#xD;
suame~tha't 'I am aware of in the State'&#xD;
'~ Your mother then was a Graham," said the general,&#xD;
still deeply musings "The Grahams and the Bledsoes&#xD;
are hitimately connected: was your family from the neigh-&#xD;
borhood~of Mecklenberg?"&#xD;
"They. were from i3he immediate vicinity of Mecklen-&#xD;
berg," 8aid' Mildmay.&#xD;
"Then, Mr. Mildmay," said the general, his face ani-&#xD;
mated with a smile, "if we Americans paid much atten-&#xD;
tion to genealogical i~rees, IL should not be surprised if we&#xD;
could trace ourselves back to the same stock; Ilkuow of&#xD;
no Mecklenberg Gr~ahams that are not relations of mine."&#xD;
"1 am quite flattered," said Graham, "by your sup-&#xD;
position; 'it will be 'a source of pleasure for me to know&#xD;
that I have so interesting, though so vague a claim upon&#xD;
yoixr good opinion."&#xD;
"And .~not ~o vague,~ either," interrupted the general.&#xD;
"~"oui grandfather, or great uncle,-and I. don't kxiow&#xD;
whieh,-..just ~at the, close of 'the ~Revolution, married&#xD;
iJietty Bledsoe, and we are certainly third cousins' at&#xD;
least4"&#xD;
Graham lau~hea, and replied, "he hoped it were&#xD;
true."~&#xD;
At this instant, t1~ young niistre~s' of fleritage Place.&#xD;
came into the room. She was attired in a simple dress of&#xD;
white, sand ~ad endeavored to assume' a dignified appear-&#xD;
ance by'ariai~ing. her 'hair over her teniples;' but the&#xD;
straggling cur1~ 'peeped out quit~'comica1ly, in ~pite of her&#xD;
1abor~ ~a 'deliv~t~ rosebud and a few green 'leaves' gli~tened&#xD;
&#xD;
on her' bosom. Annie had become so unaccustomed to&#xD;
society save that of her husband, that the appearance of a&#xD;
stranger 'brought a slight blush to her cheeks, and height-&#xD;
ened her natural beattty.&#xD;
"Mrs. Mildmay-General IBledsoe," said Graham,&#xD;
rising.&#xD;
The general rose from his seat, and placing his hand&#xD;
upon his heart, he bowed, as if a courtier by profession;&#xD;
and then extending his hand, he~ just touched the tips of&#xD;
Annie's fingers, and remarked:&#xD;
"I am happy to have the pleasure of meeting with~ a&#xD;
lady whose presence has added so much Igrace and beauty'&#xD;
to' our vicinity. At this very moment, I was trying to&#xD;
prove to your good husband that we were some sort of~&#xD;
cousins at least; and now," he continued, smiling at An-&#xD;
tile, "I shall especially insist that IL am right."&#xD;
Annie expressed her ,gratification at Gen. Bledsoe's'&#xD;
evident cordiality of manner,-more by her eyes, than by&#xD;
her remarks; ~the conversation soon became discursive&#xD;
and agreeable, and when Gen. 'Bledsoe left Heritage Place,&#xD;
a mutual friendship 'had sprung up between himself and&#xD;
its occupants: and this feeling seemed to have been&#xD;
founded rather upon long years of intercourse, than an&#xD;
accidental meeting of an hour's duration.&#xD;
The moment Gen. Bledsoe left, .Mildmay ordered&#xD;
"old Uncle 'Dan" to go to'Beechland; and bring up the&#xD;
body of Jack, that it might be decently interred upon the&#xD;
plantation.&#xD;
Uncle Dan was an eccentric, stuttering old man, who'&#xD;
believed in charms and necromancy, and was lot~ked upon'&#xD;

&#xD;
by his fellow-slaves with considerable superstitious dread.&#xD;
When he was told to get his cart, and the object of his&#xD;
errand, Old Dan rolled up the white of his eyes in~the&#xD;
most alarming manner, and inquired,&#xD;
"Wha-wha---what make Jack done die for?"&#xD;
"You will hear that some other time," said Mildmay,&#xD;
a cloud passing over his face at the recollection of the&#xD;
boy's fate; "do as I tell you, and ask no questions now."&#xD;
"But master," said IDan, his face still indicating un-&#xD;
mitigated terror, "Wha-wha-what I goin' to do alone&#xD;
wid such a funeral ?"&#xD;
"Come straight back from town," said Mildmay,&#xD;
sternly; "and if you stop by the way at any of those&#xD;
groggeries on the edge of Beechland, you will regret it,&#xD;
eir, for the rest of the year."&#xD;
"Wh'-wh'--why, master, you tink I do dat?" and&#xD;
Dan hobbled off with a manner that would leave an im-&#xD;
pression upon those who did not know him, that he was&#xD;
exceedingly injured at Mildmay's imputation on his im-&#xD;
maculate character.&#xD;
Dan went to the stable, and catching a mule that was&#xD;
used for all work, he put on the harness, and then attached&#xD;
the cart; and having arranged every thing to suit his&#xD;
mind; he crept into the loft, and brought down a bag of&#xD;
shelled corn; then gAng to his own garden-patch, he&#xD;
pulled up a few vegetables, nearly gone to seed, and&#xD;
placed them beside the corn; then jumping over the fence&#xD;
into his mistress's garden, he crawled upon his hands and&#xD;
knees among some low bushes, covered by what was once&#xD;
the shed of a bee-house, and dexterously took two setting&#xD;
&#xD;
hens, of the Bantam breed, from off their nests; and put-&#xD;
ting the exposed eggs in 'his pockets, lie got back safely to&#xD;
his cart: and arranging the eggs in some cotton seed, and&#xD;
tying the, hens like a bundle in a handkerchief, he covered&#xD;
the whole up with 'dry fodder,' and with a sanctimonious&#xD;
look, drove out into the highway.&#xD;
Mildmay, who was temporarily occupied in superin-&#xD;
tending some repairs in the road, was sitting on his horse,&#xD;
when Dan made his appearance; and as the old negro&#xD;
humbly touched his hat to C~ master," he remarked:&#xD;
"I see, Dan, you have not forgotten the old mule's&#xD;
appetite, judging from the fodder you take along with&#xD;
you."&#xD;
'Dan covered up the confusion of his face, by pretending&#xD;
to look at something in his rear, and~ then pulling his old&#xD;
hat over his eyes, as a mark of respect to his master, he'&#xD;
passed on without detection. Mildmay under ordinary air-&#xD;
cumstances would have discovered The fraud, but his mind&#xD;
was too much occupied by' the events of the day, to observe&#xD;
all the minor incidents passing before him.&#xD;
Dan, as is the case with all old negroes, had a way of&#xD;
conversing with himself, and if you could overhear him&#xD;
it would be difficult, at first, to imagine that .he was really&#xD;
alone, he gave such effect to his "~thinking aloud,"-the&#xD;

In similar pleasant conversation, D~n indulged, until&#xD;
he reached the suburb of Beecliland, and then stopping his&#xD;
mule, he cautiously looked around to see if any one was&#xD;
near him, when satisfying hiniseif that he was not observed,&#xD;
he took out his stolen goods, and depositing them with&#xD;
precipitation underneath some brush by the road side, he&#xD;
hobbled into his seat and rode along.&#xD;
In a few moments he was in the town-~-among the old&#xD;
ruined buildings that every where met the eye, was one&#xD;
distingui8hable for having doors still on their fastenings,&#xD;
and windows patched with paper, and fishes filled with&#xD;
rags. Across the front of this wretched house, wa~ painted&#xD;
"Grocery," but some wag had blotted up the bottom curve&#xD;
of the c, and it read, groGery, which wui really the idea&#xD;
the sign was intended to convey.&#xD;
As Dan neared this noticeable place, he commenced&#xD;
hallooing with unusual vehemence to his mule, at the&#xD;
sa~me time, by pretending the animal would not obey the&#xD;
reins, he managed to land close against the door, which&#xD;
was immediately opened, and Dan was greeted by a rough-&#xD;
looking white man,-a few tekgraphic signs passed be-&#xD;
tween the pair, and the negro assuming his naturally inn~o-&#xD;
cent and stolid look, continued his journey.&#xD;
Passing by a large and evidently a substantial store,&#xD;
a very gentlemanly-looking young man hallooed out to&#xD;
Dan.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Ho! boy, don't you belong to Mr. Mildmay?"&#xD;
"Ye-ye-yes----.master," said Dan touching his hat.&#xD;
"Then," said the gentleman, "when you go home, stop&#xD;
here, I have something to put in your cart."&#xD;
"Ye-ye--yes, sir," said Dan, again touching his apo-&#xD;
logy for a bat.&#xD;
Without more adventure, Dan reached the court-house,&#xD;
where still lay, and entirely alone, the body of the unfortu-&#xD;
nate Jack, but now protected from the vulgar gaze, by a&#xD;
straight-sided box, made of rough boards, which had been&#xD;
supplied by the order of the coroner.&#xD;
Dan sat in his cart, and filled with strange emotions,&#xD;
eyed askance the wreck of mortality.-As we have said,&#xD;
he was superstitious, and he had a terrible dread of the&#xD;
dead.&#xD;
"Wha-wha-wha-what in de world massa send old&#xD;
Dan down here for,-.--spose Jack come back agin, and I&#xD;
'lone in de woods, wha.-wha.--wha~what eum of old Dan,&#xD;
ha?" and the poor fellow seemed to expect that every mo-&#xD;
ment he should be assaulted by spirits fron~ another world.&#xD;
Not many nw~ents passed, however, before Dan was&#xD;
surrounded by a ~aminber of idle negro gossips, and long&#xD;
and dismal stori. and fearful reminiscences were given,&#xD;
until from talking ajid listening, they would start at their&#xD;
own voices-then anxious to get away from the suggesting&#xD;
cause of so much terror, they helped Dan to place the coffin&#xD;
in the cart, and rapidly disappeared.&#xD;
The negro, now aln~ost paralyzed with fear and tre~n~o&#xD;
bling, took out his charm, and addressing' the little par-&#xD;
cel as if it had been an intelligent being, asked of it ~to&#xD;

afford him protection in the dark woods, and not to let&#xD;
Jack cQme back and hurt him; and he then started for&#xD;
home: but soon coming up to the store, where he was re-&#xD;
quested to stop, one of the clerks, without deigning to ask&#xD;
Dan what he had for his load, put a bale of rope, a box of&#xD;
raisins, and a cheese, on top of the coffin; told Dan "to&#xD;
get them to his master safe," and ran back into the store.&#xD;
"Wa-wa-well," said Dan, as he moved along, "got&#xD;
something else in dat cart to keep old Dan company;&#xD;
s'pose old Dan tinks da-da-da-dat box empty, den it's all&#xD;
right: go 'long, Dick Johnson," jerking the mule, "don't&#xD;
be getting to sleep at dis time ob day. Oh, Lord!&#xD;
wha-a-a-what will become of old niggers ?" and for a&#xD;
moment lost in this reflection, he broke out in a loud&#xD;
voice, "Dar's Dick a dancing' wid my gal-le-le-let de cot-&#xD;

oh, Lord!"&#xD;
Arriving at the place where he deposited his "plixn-&#xD;
der," he got down from his seat, and looki~ig cautiously&#xD;
around, thrust his hand under the bush, and pulled out&#xD;
a bottle of whiskey "corked" with a corncob; and taking&#xD;
therefrom a hearty swig, he resumed hi~ place, more vocif-&#xD;
erous than ever.&#xD;
'Towards midnight the body of Jack was deposited in&#xD;
his humble, but once happy cabin.&#xD;
The grave had. already been dug; and just as the&#xD;
moon commenced rising above the horizon, a few fellow.&#xD;
servants, who kindly remembered Jack, joined in a funeral&#xD;
&#xD;
A TALE OF SOUTHERN LIFE.             24~I&#xD;
&#xD;
procession to pay' the last tribute to the obscure dead.&#xD;
As the humble mourners moved along, the simple hymn&#xD;
went up, that breathed a hope of immortality. The body&#xD;
was lowered into its last resting-place,-.~-the cold sod fell&#xD;
heavily upon the rude encasement. When the burial was&#xD;
completed, the old negro workman gave a last pat with his&#xD;
heavy spade, and said,&#xD;
"Thank old Marster above! Jack's done got free pa-&#xD;
pers at last."&#xD;
Major Trimmer was not disappointed in his expecta-&#xD;
tions of a client, when he saw the murdered body of Jack,&#xD;
for he knew that he must be " engaged for the defence,~~&#xD;
for no sooner had Toadvine time to collect his ideas,&#xD;
than he sent the jailer to the major; as might be expected,&#xD;
Trimmer immediately answered the summons.&#xD;
The moment Major Trimmer entered Toadvine's cell,&#xD;
he assumed a vacant look, and answered eyery question&#xD;
with the bluntest imaginaiide monosyllables. To such an&#xD;
extent was this carried, that his client finally became ner-&#xD;
vous, and asked an explanation.&#xD;
"The first thing to be attended to," said the major,&#xD;
suddenly finding his loquacious tongue, "is the fee'~; ar-&#xD;
range for that, and we will at once proceed to business."&#xD;
"And how much will it be?" asked Toadvine, putting&#xD;
his hand in his pocket.&#xD;
"A thDusand dollars would be a smalL sum for so bad&#xD;
a case as yours; but, considering'you are not too rich, I'll&#xD;
say five hundred."&#xD;
"You don't mean to say you charge five hundred for&#xD;

getting me out of this little affair, do you?" said Toadvine,&#xD;
gaping in astonishment.&#xD;
"I don't know what you call a little affair," said the&#xD;
major, rising and buttoning his coat, as if intending to go;&#xD;
"if living in the penitentiary for ten years is a little&#xD;
affair, I hope you will have a good time of it."&#xD;
"But you don't think it is any thing serious, do you?"&#xD;
inquired Toadvine, becoming alarmed.&#xD;
"Why, if being in custody, with a clear case of killing&#xD;
against you, and the whole community in arms, ain't&#xD;
serious, then I have studied my profession in vain."&#xD;
"I see," said Toadvine, his fears coming upon him&#xD;
with tenfold force-" I see, but how can I pay you so large&#xD;
a' sum, when I haven't got the money?"&#xD;
"Well, what have you got?" inquired the major, sen-&#xD;
tentiously.&#xD;
"There's my horse," said Toadvine, with bitterness;&#xD;
"he is worth seventy-five dollars."&#xD;
"Well,~~ said the major.&#xD;
"Then here is a due-bill on Smithers &amp;amp; Co., drawn'&#xD;
at ninety days by Mr. Mildmay~'for one hundred and sixty&#xD;
dollars"&#xD;
~ echoed the major.&#xD;
"And is not that, enough to commence with?" gasped&#xD;
Toadvine, for the first time beginning to feel that it did&#xD;
cost something to "kill a nigger."&#xD;
"Why," said the major, reckoning a moment' in his&#xD;
head, "if I take the horse and due-bill even as cash, they&#xD;
will only make two hundred and forty-four dollars; secure&#xD;
&#xD;
me enough to make up the five hundred, else I shall have&#xD;
no excuse to keep me from appearing for the State."&#xD;
"You wouldn't go agin me?" said Toadvine, turning&#xD;
pale with apprehension.&#xD;
"I must make a living," said the major, as cold as&#xD;
marble.&#xD;
"But," said Toad~ine, more than ever sorry that he&#xD;
had killed Jack, "I have no other property except an un~&#xD;
divided interest in the boy Jo, now in the possession of&#xD;
Col. Price."&#xD;
"How much d~ you own of that nigger?"&#xD;
~ One half" said Toadvine.&#xD;
"And do you think I could buy the other half of&#xD;
Price ?"&#xD;
"I think not, because, you see, ever since Col. Price&#xD;
parted from his wife, she wQn't sign away, what he calls,&#xD;
her 'infernal rights."'&#xD;
"Paraphernal rights," you mean, said the major, his&#xD;
eye beaming with conscious superiority.&#xD;
"Well, it's something that keeps Price froni selling&#xD;
his half of Jo, and that's all I know about it."&#xD;
Now the major had informed himself in advance of all&#xD;
the property that Toadvine was worth, so pullii~g out a&#xD;
paper, and a pocket inkstand, he made a preliminary&#xD;
transfer to himself of all Toadvine's worldly goods, viz.,&#xD;
the horse,.-.Mildmay's due-bill,--and the legal possession&#xD;
of half of the negro boy Jo; that being done, the major 'at&#xD;
once entered upon the business before him, and in less&#xD;
than ten minutes satisfied Toadvine that it was now easy&#xD;
to get him clear tf the consequences of killing Jack,-.&#xD;

&#xD;
which made Toadvine again come to the conclusion in his&#xD;
own mind, that twenty dollars was even more than enough&#xD;
to pay any one for getting him out of "this little affair."&#xD;
After a great deal of "tacking and filling" by the&#xD;
major,. more to affect the imagination of his client than&#xD;
any thing else, it was finally agreed that the "hctbeas cor-&#xD;
pus" was not to be attempted, because it might be possi-&#xD;
ble that the judge would be strict, as the excitement on&#xD;
the public mind, was decidedly against the prisoner. And&#xD;
Major Trimmer came to the conclusion, also, that. it wa~&#xD;
possibly safer for Toadvine to stay in jail than to run the&#xD;
*risk of falling into the ~hands of ~Gen, Bledsoe and his&#xD;
friends; an~ by ~way of consolation to the prisoner, he said:&#xD;
"By lying in a jail a few weeks before the trial, it will&#xD;
create a sympathy for you outside; and will enable me to&#xD;
show the jury, that even while the law presumed that you&#xD;
were innocent, you had suffered sufficient punishment,&#xD;
even if guilty of the crime charged:" and with these rea-&#xD;
sons, Toadvine was content to remain in durance vile.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
DIXON JOURNEYS ON BUSINESS.&#xD;
DIX02~T amused himself while in Washington by attend-&#xD;
ing the debates in "~both houses of Congress." He was&#xD;
quite a politician in his way, and nothing pleased him so&#xD;
much, he said, "as to hoar Southern members talk to&#xD;
Northern representatives, as if they owned them."&#xD;
From some of the "N. C.'s" of the "Middle States"&#xD;
he obtained much valuable information relative to the&#xD;
C'&#xD;
supply," and from others of the extreme southwest, of&#xD;
the "demand" for negroes. His- address in commanding&#xD;
attention from "pulAic men" was much 'admired by Dix-&#xD;
on's confederates, and was frequently alluded to by them&#xD;
as one of the many evidences of his uncommon talents.&#xD;
Dixon himself felt his decided superiority in, this re-&#xD;
spect, and would sometimes amuse his friends with anec-&#xD;
dotes, illustrating how he used these very gentlemen for&#xD;
his own purposes. He mentioned several particular cases&#xD;
where he go~L possession of "favorite body servants" by&#xD;
advancing a few hundred dollars just at~ the time their&#xD;
masters were hard up at the gaming-table, or deprived ~of&#xD;

&#xD;
their reason, by the long-continued debauch'; for he took a&#xD;
sort of malicious satisfaction in getting the better in a&#xD;
bargain of men, who, though. at the time overreached by&#xD;
him, were nevertheless receiving the echoed plaudits of&#xD;
the coijintry, for "their great speeches in the national&#xD;
councils."&#xD;
One. night after sitting out a very "late debate,"&#xD;
Dixon walked slowly out of the "Capitol" toward "his&#xD;
pen," on the suburbs ~of the city. It must have been&#xD;
eleven o'clock, when his signal was recognized by the sleepy&#xD;
attendant, who let him in.&#xD;
"Has Hovey got back from Colesburg, Putty-face ?"&#xD;
said he, taking his seat at the rude' pine table, and pulling&#xD;
out a little leather-covered note-book, preparatory to look-&#xD;
ing over its contents.&#xD;
"He's come back, and has just turned in," said the&#xD;
man, snuffing the candle with his thumb and forefinger.&#xD;
"Tell him I want to see him," said Dixon, looking&#xD;
over .hi~ note-book.&#xD;
"Putty-face" walked across the room, opened a door,&#xD;
and exposed upon a rude bench, a man with his clothes on,&#xD;
and asleep.&#xD;
"Wake up here 1" said he, giving the man a shake.&#xD;
Hovey sprang upright in bed, and although still al-&#xD;
most asleep, had instinctively, as it were, grasped a long&#xD;
knife, that was under his pillow, and opening his eyes, de-&#xD;
manded in most shockingly profane language, what was the&#xD;
matter?&#xD;
"Dixon wants you," was the simple reply.&#xD;
"I was clre~ming ju8t~now,". said Hovey, putting up&#xD;
&#xD;
his knife, and hunting around for. his shoes, "that some-&#xD;
body was going to cut my throat;" 'and after. uttering this&#xD;
pleasant reminiscence, he shui~ed into Dixoii's presence,&#xD;
and took a seat on the opposite side of the table.&#xD;
For some moments the; negro trader continued to ex-&#xD;
amine tl~e hieroglyphic marks before him; when he turned&#xD;
around suddenly to Hovey, and said:&#xD;
'What news from Colesburg ?"&#xD;
'Nothing," said Hovey, sententiously.&#xD;
"You think that no more niggers can be bought in that&#xD;
neighborhood ?"&#xD;
"1 do," responded Hovey, at the same time yawning&#xD;
excessively.&#xD;
"And I don't," said Dixon, with a confident tone of&#xD;
voice: "you see, Hovey, when you think you have got all&#xD;
the niggers out~ of a place, the best ones is generally left&#xD;
behind. I~{iggers is like pigs,-.them that ain't worth&#xD;
much run ahead, and come into ,inar.~ket before them that&#xD;
will bring the most. money."&#xD;
"I didn't. hear of any," sleepily drawled I1ovey~&#xD;
"Did you inquire about old General Blueridge's house&#xD;
servants?" asked Dixon, looking attentively at his book.&#xD;
"He sold all' oi~it last, spring."&#xD;
~" And old Aifovernor Fento~, what's he doing?&#xD;
" I think yc~u could get hi~ boy now, ~f you went your-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
&#xD;
."And what makes you think so ?" asked Dixon, quite&#xD;
animatedly.&#xD;
"'Cause he's out for office, and must treat tGget elected. "&#xD;
Dixon, when he heard this reply, laid down his book,&#xD;

&#xD;
and looked at his assistant for some seconds with intense&#xD;
admiration, and then said:&#xD;
"Hovey, you  are larnin'-for if Fenton is on the&#xD;
stunip agin7 I could lend him money on his soul, if it was&#xD;
worth 'a mortgage; to say nothing of that yeller fellow he&#xD;
calls 'C~esar, my boy 1"' and Dixon made a rude note in&#xD;
his book.&#xD;
"And supposin' you do lend him money?" asked Ho-&#xD;
vey, with some interest.&#xD;
"Suppose I do!" replied iDixon, triumphantly, "why,&#xD;
if you lend a man, about such a place as Colesburg, a&#xD;
few hundred on any thing, you must close the mortgage&#xD;
when it's due, to get your. money back. I've seen&#xD;
niggers that their masters thought as much of, as they&#xD;
did of their own flesh and blood, and perhaps they l!Lad&#xD;
reason to, and they wouldn't sell, oh no! too consciattious&#xD;
-under too many obligations to the darkee, and his dad&#xD;
and mammy before him, to let him go to I.~ouisiana; but they&#xD;
would borrow two or three hundred till next fall, and give&#xD;
the 'pet,' as collateral security-i-when I cum round agin,&#xD;
and wanted the money, the-men would all ;go into the dig-&#xD;
nified, and the women into the hysterics, but the darkee&#xD;
was mine, no fc~u1t of theirs, - of course I-' my hardy&#xD;
heart!' 'my ctuel dispositioA' did jist all-it's a great&#xD;
game, this world 1" said Dixon, apparently confounded at&#xD;
'the magnitud&amp;amp;of his ~ojwn thoughts and reflections.&#xD;
-After a few moments musing, the trader started up, and&#xD;
said, "I'll take the cars tomorrow morning, and go to Coles-&#xD;
burg myself. There's one .or two light mulatto girls there,&#xD;
I must have at any price. If Ragan sends around a ne-&#xD;
&#xD;
gro to-morrow, with a swelled throat, and a seton. in his&#xD;
neck; put the sick cuss down in the cellar until I come&#xD;
back, maybe he's got something catching. I bought that&#xD;
old negro, '11~ndolph; to-day, of Wilkins, and also the&#xD;
buggy, and the wheelbarrows ~ have the buggy put under&#xD;
the shed and covered up, and if old Randolph hasn't got&#xD;
any bedclothes, he must rough it th~ best way he can. If&#xD;
that widow lady, who keeps the fashionable hotel, near&#xD;
the 'white house,' and wants a middle-aged, respectable-&#xD;
1ook~ng negro man, for a table waiter, thinks Homer is too&#xD;
old, have his front teeth filed down, his hair well dyed,&#xD;
and hi~ skin greased, and keep him up until I come back.&#xD;
from Colesburg,-.and, finally," said Dixon, putting up his&#xD;
memorandum book, "if any body wants to se~ me very&#xD;
muchsay I sht~ll be gone a week;' and now go to bed, if&#xD;
you want to, and I'll turn in, myself."&#xD;
Dixon~ at the conclusion of these general remarks,&#xD;
without ceremony took the light, and pxamining the fast-&#xD;
enings of the front door, and walking across the room, and&#xD;
putting his ear to the keyhole of the door that opened&#xD;
into the cells of the negroes in "his yard;" he seemed&#xD;
to be satisfied that all was right, and going, into a rather&#xD;
comfortalile adjoining room, hastily retired, ,and was soon&#xD;
asleep.&#xD;
4Jolesburg, although mu~h gone to decay, was originally&#xD;
one of the most pleasant and thriving towns in Virginia.&#xD;
For more tht~n 'thirty years, it had graduali~ declined in&#xD;
population and importance. The people of the surrounding&#xD;
country had ,one after another, moved -away to the south'&#xD;
and west, leaving' large tracts of worn-out land,' dotted&#xD;

&#xD;
ovei~witJi statelyy. but decaying residences, altogether pre-&#xD;
senting the most terrible pictures of desolation that could&#xD;
offend the eye, or harrow up the heart.&#xD;
From the vicinity of Oolesburg, Dixon had for many&#xD;
years; through his agents, purchased a large part Gf the&#xD;
choicest " house-raised" negroes, which he offered for sale&#xD;
in New Orleans, ~ut never having been to the place him-&#xD;
self, he was on the occasion of his present visit, a perfect&#xD;
stranger to the town.&#xD;
In accordance with his usual manner of doing business,&#xD;
he desired to have the purpose of his visit to Colesburg&#xD;
unknown until he satisfied himself what were the chances&#xD;
of accomplishing his wishes; for Dixon knew from sad ex-&#xD;
perience, that however anxious people might be to sell&#xD;
their "property," they visited upon him, as a negro-trader,&#xD;
indignation that should have been, as he thought, "equally&#xD;
shared by those who furnished the articles of traffic."&#xD;
KDixon therefore, on his arrival at Colesburg, wrote his&#xD;
name in the hotel books, and under "residence," put" Bos-&#xD;
ton, Ms.," a bit of shrewdness that had on more than one&#xD;
occasion, answered the desired purpose; and having done&#xD;
this, and directed his baggage to be sent to his room, he&#xD;
strolled leisurely about the streets.&#xD;
The morning following Dixon's arrival at Colesburg,&#xD;
was Sirnday, and after breakfast he dressed with more than&#xD;
usual care, combed his~hai~ over his forehead, and walked&#xD;
down stairs, preparatory to fulfilling a determination of go-&#xD;
ing 'to church. On the porch of the hotel, he ~sawa~en-&#xD;
tletnan, whQ seemed to have a communicative sort of ex-&#xD;
pre8sioll, and Dixon in his direct way asked him,-" If&#xD;
&#xD;
the large church he saw in the centre of Colesburg had a&#xD;
gallery?"&#xD;
"It has a gallery," said the individual addressed, "but&#xD;
it is principally occupied by negroes. If you will see the&#xD;
sexton, Cola Graves, he will, no doubt, show you to a seat&#xD;
down stairs, and among some of our 'best families."'&#xD;
"I am not very particular whereabouts. I worship,"&#xD;
said Dixon, with an irony he could scarcely conceal.&#xD;
"You Northerners don't seem to be as particular in these&#xD;
matters as the Virginians are," said the garrulous speaker.&#xD;
"And how do you know I am a Northerner?" said&#xD;
Dixon, turning abruptly upon the unfortunate object of his&#xD;
displeasure.&#xD;
"I reckon a man that hails from Boston can't be much&#xD;
else," said. the man, evidently delighted with his own&#xD;
shre'~rdne~s, "but you needn't get angry about it," he gra-&#xD;
ciously observed, "for' I never think more or less of a man&#xD;
merely on account 'of hisA birth-place."&#xD;
"But I do," returned Dixon, his face a good deal&#xD;
flushed.&#xD;
The man looked at him a moment with evident grat-&#xD;
ification, and went on.&#xD;
"I am happy to meet with a Northern man, who has&#xD;
such sentiments-4 honor you for it.. 'it's an old Virginia&#xD;
weakness, sir, to be proud of one's native State. If I came&#xD;
from Boston even, I should state the fact-bear the 9onse-&#xD;
quences-be a Yankee.",&#xD;
"But I am not such a hell of a Yjiankee as you take&#xD;
me. to be," said Dixon, boiling 'internally with wrath, yet&#xD;

"I t'hou~ht so myself," returned the man, with some&#xD;
vivacity, "for you see I look over the hotel books every&#xD;
morning, and I ean tell where people were raised by their&#xD;

"Jiow cai~ you do that?" asked Dixon eagerly.&#xD;
"Why, you 'see," returned this 'Mr. Pry,' that the&#xD;
genuine Yankee always dots his I'$ and crosses his T's,&#xD;
and writes~his name straight along, whether the paper is&#xD;
ruled or, not, but the Southerner generally goes up and&#xD;
down, an4 crossWise,~ and don't stop to attend to vulgar,&#xD;

Dixon wrote his signature so that it was easily made,&#xD;

untutored child. There was a want of decision about the&#xD;
letters;' that had caused him much mortification, but&#xD;

ceedingly delighted that lie possessed this, to him hereto-&#xD;
fore unknown evidence of sectionality, and with a smile 'of&#xD;
unusual' satisfaction, he walked into the street.&#xD;
Dixon managed to arrive at the "sacred edifice" just&#xD;
before the s~r~vices commenced, and 'walking 'up into the&#xD;
gallery of the ehurbh, he took one of the ~seats appropriat-&#xD;
ed for' the whites-seats seldomm visited except by the poor-&#xD;
est and' humblest citizens..' In fact the vicinity might h~we&#xD;
been with propriety termed "proscribed," for it was gen-&#xD;
erally' supposed, that any one who would advertise his&#xD;

&#xD;
259'&#xD;
&#xD;
graceless conditiofi, by occupying these "free seats," gave&#xD;
evidence of being utterly lo~t to all self.respect.&#xD;
The assumed sanctimonious face of Dixon, his good&#xD;
figure, and well arranged suit of black, caused one or two&#xD;
of the elders to look up inquiringly at his perch; and at&#xD;
one time; it appeared as if he would be invited to sit nearer&#xD;
"the head pf the table," an act of courtesy. which would&#xD;
have given him pleasure, but which he would most posi-&#xD;
tively have declined.&#xD;
Before him, as in an amphitheatre, were displayed 'the&#xD;
favorite house' servants of the town of Colesburg. The day&#xD;
was fine, and the exhibition was unusually imposing. There&#xD;
sat the negroes, characterized by every possible shade of&#xD;
color, fron~. the sooty black up to the bllueish white, and&#xD;
possessed of every possible variety of expression in their&#xD;
faces.&#xD;
Some Were scarcely able to conceal their exultation, as&#xD;
they surveyed their gaudily-decked"persons, while others,&#xD;
unmistakably 'alluded' in no very complimentary' terms ~to&#xD;
Dixon, as a white man that had "got into tl~e wrong&#xD;
pew."&#xD;
In the front row sat "Maria," the only servant of&#xD;
"Mr. Goodall," a likely-looking, intelligent girl of eighteen&#xD;
or twenty, plainly but tastefully dressed. There was an&#xD;
air of contentment and intelligence about her face that in-&#xD;
dicated the well-raised domestic. In her hand sh~ held~ a&#xD;
handsomely-bound volume, which~ she occasionally leaned&#xD;
over as if desirous of learning its contents. Behind Maria&#xD;
were several ascending rows of females, including every&#xD;
variety of person and age, also a great number of' men,&#xD;

A TALE OF SOUTHERN LIFE.         261&#xD;
&#xD;
260             THE MASTER'S HOUSE&#xD;
&#xD;
mostly in the prime of life, all looking fat and sleek, and&#xD;
vying favorably with the white congregation in the body&#xD;
of the church, in the fineness of their clothing, and atten-&#xD;
tion to the observances of the day.&#xD;
As~ Dixon sat down, he bent his body forward, as if&#xD;
invoking a blessing, but he really assumed this attitude,&#xD;
that he' ~night more satisfactorily scan through his half part-&#xD;
ed fingers the appearance of the "property" before him.&#xD;
"iLthink," he soliloquized, after a long~ professional&#xD;
gaze, regarding a venerable-looking negro, who seemed to&#xD;
act in the capacity of subordinate sexton, "I think that&#xD;
that woolly-headed old crow would be all the better for&#xD;
having' his feet in 'the stocks a few nights, with his shirt&#xD;
off, and mosquitoes plenty.&#xD;
"That saddle-colored' nigger grinning at me, 'cause he&#xD;
thinks I don't know where to get the right seat' in church,&#xD;
would be all' the better for about 'forty-five,' well laid on,&#xD;
and tarpentined to make 'em stick.&#xD;
"I l~elieve that I could'get about eleven hundred dollars&#xD;
in New Orleans, for that young fellow pushing the window&#xD;
up'&#xD;
"As for the monkey who sits near him, his shoulders&#xD;
are so narrer that he ain't worth his passage to Louisiana,"&#xD;
and thus he thought 'on, until his eyes glanced over the&#xD;
lower seats occupied by the females.&#xD;
"None of 'em has got the light color for real fancy&#xD;
niggers," he 'almost groaned, as he discovered the fact.' "I&#xD;
should lik~ to have the burning off of them pink ribbons&#xD;
from the head of that 'cook, washer and ironer,'" he sug-&#xD;
&#xD;
gjested to himself, becoming indignant ~t ~the tasteful cap&#xD;
of a middle-aged* negress.&#xD;
'f If that gal in the plaid dress can do plain sewing, she&#xD;
would fetch more than if she was sold for a field hand.'&#xD;
"Wonder how many of 'em is free? "he asked, almost&#xD;
aloud, his presence of mind being for the moment overcome&#xD;
at the thought of sueh a dreadful supposition.&#xD;
"How many is(members of this 'ere church ?.-.wonder&#xD;
if Spooney in the pulpit there goes in for the Bible, sanc-&#xD;
tioning slavery? Hello, he's coming out with a hyme, and&#xD;
that girl with the gilt-edged book is a hunting' for the varse&#xD;
-.--that nigger 'would sell," and for the first time, he took&#xD;
a particular look at" Mr. Goodall's" Maria.&#xD;
"She comes it StrQng," said Dixon, after listening a~&#xD;
while; and plainly distinguishing her voice above the whole&#xD;
congregation. "Why don't Southern churches buy singing&#xD;
niggers and own their choirs?" and as the plausibility of&#xD;
the thing struck his mind, he made a memorandum in&#xD;
his never-to-be-forgotten book.&#xD;
* The services being ended, the congregation separated&#xD;
into a variety of streams, and distributed itself over the&#xD;
town. Although Dixon was recognized as a stranger, still&#xD;
no one had ~us~ected his vocation, and he wandered down&#xD;
the principal street.. towards his hotel, the subject of much&#xD;
innocent gossip, the popular impression being, that he was&#xD;
in some way connected with a proposed railroad that a&#xD;
"Northern company" had projected in the vicinity.&#xD;
Dixon, from the information he already had of the~&#xD;
town and its people, and from his own examination at&#xD;
church, 'had formed a Very good idea of the "state of the&#xD;

&#xD;
market," and determined to set at once about business,&#xD;
regardless of his disguise. With this resolution in his&#xD;
mind, he saw coming toward, him a young man whom he&#xD;
had noticed hanging about the bar of the hotel, whose care-&#xD;
worn looks gave painful evidence that he was, from dissi-&#xD;
pation, to be a, victim of a premature grave.&#xD;
"I think that young man might be of service to me,&#xD;
and as he drinks hard, he'll n~t be over particular as to&#xD;
what he does, to get a. little money, proud as he looks,"&#xD;
thought Dixon, standing still on the walk, until the person&#xD;
alluded to came up.&#xD;
"You'll excuse, me, stranger," said Dixon, the instant&#xD;
he was within speaking distance, "you will excuse me, if I&#xD;
ask you what time they dine on Sunday, at the hotel? for,&#xD;
I perceive you are one of its boarders."&#xD;
"I do pafronize the place," replied the young man, in a&#xD;
grandiloquent manner. "I suffer myself to go about the&#xD;
premises, when I have nothing better to do."&#xD;
Dixon perceiving that the gentleman was communica-&#xD;
tive, dropped his query about the dinner, and went on&#xD;
"I am a stranger in Colesburg,-came here on a little&#xD;
private business, and should like some information."&#xD;
"I am at leisure to answer any inquiries," said the&#xD;
young man, "but the fact is, I am so confounded dry, that&#xD;
I ean't speak the truth."&#xD;
"Walk back to the hotel, sir," said Dixon, "for I have&#xD;
good brandy in my room, or we can take some at the bar."&#xD;
"I will take a drink," returned the young man, "though&#xD;
I have threatened to out the concern, particularly on ac-&#xD;
&#xD;
count of the bad liquQr they keep; for if there is any thing&#xD;
I do know, it's good brandy.'~&#xD;
It is needless to say, that 'Mr. Mercer '~(for that was&#xD;
the gentleman's name) and Dixon were soon apparently&#xD;
good friends.' There was a time in the young man's his-&#xD;
tory, when he was known as the proudest and most accom-&#xD;
plished scion of a stock, historically celebrated for virtue&#xD;
and independence; but the living representative had squan-&#xD;
dered his fortune, ruined his health, tarnished his. fame;.&#xD;
was, in fact, a mere wreck of his former self. The oppor.&#xD;
unity of. living off of any one, even for a day, was a rare&#xD;
privilege to Mercer, and he was prepared on the instant to&#xD;
do any thing to render himself agreeable or useful.&#xD;
At dinner, IMlercer, as Dixon's guest, drank deeply, but&#xD;
it was evident that drinking, with the trader, was more a&#xD;
form than a reality, for he never clouded his reason when&#xD;
he had any thing of importance to do.&#xD;
The secret leaked out at the table~ however, that Dixon&#xD;
was a "negro trader," and there was passed among the&#xD;
people present indignant looks, that a person of such a busi-&#xD;
ness, would presume to so publicly offend those present&#xD;
with his society.&#xD;
Dixon felt,',the instant his business was known, that the&#xD;
ban of proscription was openly put upon him, an~ it seem-&#xD;
ed, that he enjoyed the bitterness of spirit that this 'con-&#xD;
sciousness called up, for he assumed aeonfldent, a defiant&#xD;
air, and made Mercer's follies the medium through which&#xD;
he exhibited hi~ dislike, to those about him.&#xD;
Dinner over, Dixouled Mercer to his room, and helping&#xD;
him to a chair, sat down himself, to carry out his original&#xD;

purpQ$e of -finding out all he could of the people he had&#xD;
to deal with.&#xD;
"Your citizens don't like nigger-traclers much," said&#xD;
he, looking over some due-bills, taken from his well-worn&#xD;
pocket-book.&#xD;
"Don't like 'em at the dinuer-table~ or in the public&#xD;
streets," said the young man, with a sneer.&#xD;
"There wouldn't be any traders," said Dixon, with&#xD;
mor6.tlian usual seriousness, "if there were no buyers and&#xD;
sellers; and the devil don't make nice distinctions when he&#xD;
ever gets his own, that's one comfort."&#xD;
"This world is a perfect infernal humbug, and about&#xD;
as full of hypocrites as it is of human beings," returned&#xD;
Mercer, "for you see the very people that have sold me&#xD;
the most bad liquor at the highest price make it 'a point&#xD;
to be the most buq in denouncing what they call my in-&#xD;
temperate habits."&#xD;
"1~xa~tly," said Dixon, fully comprehending Mercer's&#xD;
meaning, "but about these people in Colesburg-can I buy&#xD;
a few choice ,servants in 'the neighborhood, think you? will&#xD;
the people' sell-are they hard up, or any thing of that&#xD;
sort?"&#xD;
"As for the servants," replied Mercer, that's doubtful,&#xD;
"for the 'community has been .pretty well culled-as for&#xD;
the 'Iiiard up;' there's pleiity of -cthat, for," continued the&#xD;
young mati, laughing at hi~ own conceit-.--" if there was a&#xD;
nigger to represent all the money that is wanted in Coles-&#xD;
burg, Africa would be depopulated to supply the 'demand."&#xD;
"Bxit I don't want many," said Dixon, mechanically&#xD;
eyeing his memorandum book, "only five or six, b~it they&#xD;

~'A year or two ago," said Nercer, "you 'could have&#xD;
been suited to a T; there were the. remains here at that&#xD;
time, of some of the very best estates, and towards the&#xD;
winding up of them, some men and women got into the&#xD;
markets, that were better people, 'according to my notion,&#xD;
than the 'Yankees that have moved into the places their&#xD;
masters occupied. "&#xD;
"Better to work?" said Dixon, with a comical twinkle&#xD;
of the eye.&#xD;
"No, not better to work, God knows," returned the&#xD;
young man, with emphasis, "but better Virginians~why,&#xD;
sir," continued Mercer, warming up, "there's We place on&#xD;
the upper road once known as Carlton, I think old Gen;&#xD;

"What a sweet place Virgiida. will be," suggested&#xD;
Dix~n,"when such free~-silers come along and crowd out&#xD;

"1 think I had better leave the State," said Mercer,&#xD;
after some hesitation, " and I want to ask you, Mr. Dixon,&#xD;
what you think of my goiPg down South?"&#xD;
As Dixon was ideally interested in this young nian,&#xD;
he gave him his ideas elaborately, and.answered every suc-&#xD;
cessive question to the best of his ability. In conclusion&#xD;
of his ren~iarks, that gentlen~atL said:&#xD;
"On going down the Mississippi every thing depends&#xD;
on how you start. 'If you can flare up, and' int~ke a figure,&#xD;
you'll do-but ~if you just go quietly to work at some honest&#xD;

manner, "what I have seen of yQu, Mr. Mereer, satisfies me&#xD;
that you'll do,"&#xD;

CHAPTI~R XXIII.&#xD;
DIXON'S UNEXPECTED SUCCESS.&#xD;
THE news of Dixon's business purposes spread through&#xD;
Colesburg like Wildfire. There was a secret pleasure, as&#xD;
well as absolute pain, imparted by it to 'a few w~io were&#xD;
desirous of selling; but among the negroes there was pro-&#xD;
duced a consternation, such as might be supposed to exist&#xD;
in a crowded hospital of wounded men, where a bombshell&#xD;
had fallen through the roof, and wad, before their very&#xD;
eyes, preparing to explode.&#xD;
That telegraphic power of communication, so peculiar&#xD;
to the negro, throbbed the fact through' their humble&#xD;
apartments, and' their' agitated hearts; that the white man&#xD;
so distinguished by 'his lOnely appearance in the" "church&#xD;
gallery in the morning, wa~ a negro trader; and they&#xD;
trembled with consternation ~vhen they reinenibered~ that&#xD;
he eyed th~ni' ivith earnestness and had already decided&#xD;
which among their number he-would buy.&#xD;
Through Mercer's ~indefatigable exertions, Dixon was&#xD;
early informed' 'of a "bargain" in the neighborhood' of&#xD;
Oole8burg ;'. and in company with 'his coadjutor, Dixon&#xD;

&#xD;
went into the country, and found inducemetits sufficient to&#xD;
remain away all day. In fact, it was long after dark&#xD;
before he. arrived at his hotel; and after eating a light&#xD;
supper, he went at once to his room.&#xD;
Of late Dixon had become daily mere and more sen~i-&#xD;
t~ve about the character of his pursuits; he was accumu-&#xD;
lating, almost to his own surprise, a great deal of wealth,&#xD;
and with it came the desire to~ be personally respected.&#xD;
lie had perceived the marked difference of the people of&#xD;
Colesburg toward him, when, they considered him a rail-&#xD;
road contractor (an occupation, by th9 way, Dixon looked&#xD;
upon with disgust) and a "negro trader;" and he feltliis&#xD;
business, except for its great profits, to be' more and more&#xD;
distasteful to him.&#xD;
Disposing of himself in a eomfo~ble xnanner~ in hi~&#xD;
room, he threw his feet into the window-sill,, and, acco~diflg&#xD;
to his wont, cogaated aloud:&#xD;
* "I've, made enough to quit this business,' if I choose;&#xD;
aiA I'm, tired~of doing other people's dirty work for them.&#xD;
If buying. niggers ain't respectable, let poor folk~ attend&#xD;
to tr~di~g; I think that I'll go home, turn planter, and&#xD;
* put on airs niy~elf. 'I ain't going to help.n~ake money for&#xD;

be seen dating with me at their tables: I'll ~win4 up, and&#xD;
quit in.~rchandisiffg this winter comi~1g, I reckon -"&#xD;
'.Justi at this monwnt a gentle tap wa~ heard at Dix-&#xD;
on's door, and witb(out turning, his head around, he said,&#xD;
One of the~ servants of the hotel, who had heretofore&#xD;
callal Dixon to his face' "Boss" and "Mister," and&#xD;
&#xD;
given 'other signs of being contaminated, as~ Dixon said,&#xD;
by his intercourse with "Northern society," 110W StjQOd in&#xD;
the room in a humble attitude, calling attention by the&#xD;
simple, but expressive term of. "Master~"&#xD;
So altered was the negro's manner, that Dixon did not,&#xD;
by the ear, recognize the boy; and ti~rning around to see&#xD;
who it was, could not conceal his surprise, when he dis-&#xD;
covered the familiar face of "Sandy 13i11,"-for such was&#xD;
the negro's name.&#xD;
"And what do you want?" said Dixon, n&amp;amp;w for the&#xD;
first time resuming his natural manner, and by its air&#xD;
of authority, sending a chill to Sandy BilP~ very mar-&#xD;
row and bones.&#xD;
"The notes~ sir," said the negro, pointing to several&#xD;
handsome envelopes on the mantel-piece, that had escaped&#xD;
Dixon's attention.&#xD;
"Letters to me!" murn~ured Dixon, as he raised them&#xD;
up, one by one, and read the superseriptiQil, "J-a-m-e-s&#xD;
Di-x-&amp;amp;n, E-s-q., P;r-e-s-e-n-t."&#xD;
"What does this mean, boy?" said he, giving the negro&#xD;
a look, that seenie&amp;amp; to say, "I'll thrash your hide off if&#xD;
~ou don't instantly ~plain this mystery!"&#xD;
1 don't kno~r~ master," said Sandy WII, his, knees&#xD;
fairly shaking with eear.i "I don't know, master ;dem.&#xD;
thar letters cum when you was~gone into the country.".&#xD;
"Well, take that for your stupidity, and toddle down&#xD;
stairs," said Dixon, throwing ar pie~e of silver at the boy'.4&#xD;
head.&#xD;
"WIiat~ does thi8 mean ?" soliloquized Di~oi~, break-&#xD;

with shame, and the idea was forced upon his ~iind at the&#xD;

tumbler, and the shop would be empty,-bet a hundred to&#xD;

and last letter, and sitting down near the window, his ill-.&#xD;
nature having e~raporated, in the multitude of his other&#xD;
einOti0~IS, he read as follows:&#xD;
2          COLESBURO, VA.~ July ~&#xD;
Mr. Dixon.&#xD;
DEAR Sin,-.---I understood last evening, after church&#xD;
was out~ that you had come on here to obtain a few choice&#xD;
servants. I' have brig since been forced to the conclusion,&#xD;
that slavery is a moral evil, and I have rejoiced that I&#xD;
have parted with the few I hair~ owned, to humane mas-&#xD;
ters, which is a great relief to me, in my hoi~rs of serious&#xD;
reflection. I haye one girl that has been carefully brought&#xD;
up, axf4 we are much attached to her, but I am somewhat&#xD;
advanced in years, as welL as her mistress, and we cannot&#xD;
tell at what time she may, in the course of Providence, be&#xD;
thrown without a protector, upon the wide, wicke~l world.&#xD;
I h~d determined not to sell her, but seeing you in church&#xD;
the other day, I have become deeply impressed that you&#xD;
&#xD;
are a pious man, and as ~ueh, would ~deal justly with the&#xD;
girl. I have also reflected, that xvhatever may be my&#xD;
sense ~f duty, the excitement at the North' has been ~so&#xD;
great, that it makes it perfectly impossible for me to carry&#xD;
out my original intention, of setting the girl free, a~ I&#xD;
cannot conceive a more dreadful condition, than for a once&#xD;
comfortably clothed arid well taken care 'of negro slave, to&#xD;
be thrown upon the' tender mercies of the. uncharitable&#xD;
world, and be left, as are the~ poor white laborers of the&#xD;
free States~ to starve, and die a miserable 4eath~ It&#xD;
would be difficult to get the girl's consent t~ be sold, ~&#xD;
therefore this matter must be delicately arranged; she&#xD;
will no doubt, at first, be much grieved, but we must'judge&#xD;
what is best for her welfare, ourselves, for we know b.ow~to&#xD;
provide for her real good. The girl is nearly'idnete~uy&amp;amp;ars&#xD;
of age. Address "Humanity," through the post-office,&#xD;
and say where a strictly private &amp;amp;~rview maybe had. Of&#xD;
course this communication will be considered confidential.&#xD;
I trust I may sign myself, in the bonds of brotherly lova,&#xD;
Yours;&#xD;
&#xD;
HTJMANITY.&#xD;
&#xD;
"This one is coming it rather strong !" said Dixon,&#xD;
taking out his memorandum book, and copying the address&#xD;
and business particulars, ~id tearing the letters up with&#xD;
infinite satisfaction, and tre dous "vIm" he scattered the&#xD;
pieces on the floor, and tramjded th9m~ under hi~ feet.&#xD;
By the time he had become really ~ool, Mercer came&#xD;
in, 'and full of excitement, informed Dixon "that he had&#xD;
~ot on the track ot' ~ 'fancy girl,' 'that he thought would'&#xD;

suit his wishes exact~ly. I hav@ heard this girl ~spoken of,&#xD;
I presume," continued Mercer ;" if it is the one I allude&#xD;
to, she is described as beipg so near white, that she got&#xD;
into one of the village schools, for near two quarters, with-&#xD;
out     ing satisfactorily shown that she was a negro."&#xD;
~'.' ~Something of that kind would really be a haul,"&#xD;
said Dixon, and taking out his indispensable memorandum&#xD;
book, h~ unfolded a'page that had been turned down, as if&#xD;
to mark a particular place~ and asked Mercer, "how white&#xD;
this girl w~s represented to be?"&#xD;
"If it is the one I have heard spoken of, she has blue&#xD;
~ and hair not at all like a negro's, but on the con-&#xD;
t~ry, straight, and of auburn color. She was raised by&#xD;
old ~J~od Cuz~iings, and his own daughters were the hand-&#xD;
SOme~t;$irl51 VWo years ago, at the White Sulphur Springs."&#xD;
~the eyes and li~a~i' will do," said Dixon, looking in&#xD;
the memorandum books" d again turning down the leaf;&#xD;
"but one thing I am afraid of! In New Orleans the qua-&#xD;
droons are generally delicate, their faces are not handsome,&#xD;
but their extremities are~. a fortune; some how another,&#xD;
the same cross in Virginia, with even less negro than a&#xD;
fourth in them, have big feet and handt~. What's, the rea-&#xD;
'iou of that?"&#xD;
"1 can't say," said Mercer! speculatingly, " some fault&#xD;

'Ntoncton 'say., that. if a sla'i~ could be bred, ~o as to re-&#xD;

rising any blooded stock whatever."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I think it's likely," said Dixen,~" though the market&#xD;
isn't large for these beauties, and it 'might be iwerstocked~&#xD;
-Do you know a man living ~in this town by the nan~e of&#xD;
Goodall ?" continued Dixon, abruptly changing the sub-&#xD;
ject.&#xD;
"Very well indeed," said Mercer, "that 'is 'to say, I&#xD;
know there is such a man in this place, but he i~ of a&#xD;
very common family, and I never made his acquaintance."&#xD;
"Has he got any niggers to sell? that's all I want to&#xD;
know," said Dixon pettishly, for he hated to hear any one&#xD;
talk about" family."&#xD;
"One girl," said Mercer, "named Maria; she sings~ in&#xD;
church I'm told, but you can't buy her."&#xD;
"An4 why can't I buy her? Tell me that Mr. Mercer,"&#xD;
said Dixon abruptly.&#xD;
" Simply because her master has promised to set her&#xD;
free," said tI;ie young man, with some' concealed astonish-&#xD;
ment at the trader's imperative manner.&#xD;
"I've seen her," continued Dixon. "I looked at her rell&#xD;
last Sunday; she would be worth to ni~ in Waehington,&#xD;
five hundred and fifty dollars. 'I know a family that would&#xD;
give a premium for just such a girl."'&#xD;
"Pity old Goodall wouldn't sell her," said~ 3~'Iemer;&#xD;
"she's no use to him; but 'I d~u't ~ee how it could be maii-&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
ABBTRACTIO~T5 AND LEGALITIES.&#xD;
As ~1r. Moreton was one day returning home from ]3e~ch-&#xD;
land, as was s~meVimes his wont, he dropped in at Hen-'&#xD;
tage Place. Mr. Noreton had always seemed to take, great&#xD;
pleasure in giving the young planter the benefits of his&#xD;
varied experience, and as every hint thus received, was&#xD;
cordially acted upon by Mildmay, it served to secure&#xD;
him an interest in Mr. Moreton's mind, that was not called&#xD;
forth by the more ordinary manner of corresponding sym~&#xD;
patties; for it was a fact, that the two gentlemen seldom&#xD;
met and discussed matters' of great import, that they did'&#xD;
not decidedly disagree.&#xD;
Mr. ~oreton's business to Beechland was to find, out,&#xD;
if possible, who 'had sold liquor to some of his negroes, but&#xD;
it was as usual a fruitless task, because, although the evi-&#xD;
dence was perfectly satisfactory to every one, yet resting&#xD;
upon. negro testimony alone, it was of no legal value.&#xD;
Mr. 1~Ior~ton, after stating vent to&#xD;
the facts; gave      a great'&#xD;
deal' of denunciation upoi~ the' 'laws, and 'upon the viofatots&#xD;
of his rights, and "' destroyers of his property."&#xD;
&#xD;
"How can this evil be remedied?" inquired Midmay.&#xD;
CC I have noticed, even ir~ the s1i~rt time I have resided&#xD;
here, that in 'spite of the prohibitions against selling ardent&#xD;
spirits to slaves, that 'low groggeries~' are increasing in&#xD;
Beechiand, and the rapid demora1i~ation; of, our servants&#xD;
is the consequence. I feel the .evil daily, and something&#xD;
should be done, if possible, to remedy it'; for I dare not&#xD;
now send old Dan to the village, for he invariably gets&#xD;
intoxicated, and but for the sagacity of his team in finding&#xD;
its way home, I know not what might become of~ hiin2'&#xD;
"So it is,". said Moreton' pettishly~-~-." so it i~; these&#xD;
miserable wretches who hang about our towns, take advan-&#xD;
tage of' our laws, and their white skins, to prey upon us,&#xD;
excite our servants to steal, spoil their manners, and de-&#xD;
stroy all discipline."&#xD;
"It is evidently one of the defects ~of the' institution,"&#xD;
said 'Mildmay. in a moralizing tone, "an evil growing out&#xD;
of the fact, that the* negro cannot bear testimony. against&#xD;
2 -~&#xD;
these traffickers in good morals."&#xD;
"I~xactly so," was the reply; "a law proper~nough in&#xD;
most cases, is taken advantage of to our serious injury.&#xD;
Slavery," continued the speaker, "is, after all, an, arist~&#xD;
critic institution, and it. i~ inimical to its perpetuity to&#xD;
give the poor white man political, or even legal, equ~lity.&#xD;
The planter, to secure perfect ~peace, ought to, have, the&#xD;
power to arrest and punisji these miserable vagr~nt~s; put&#xD;
them in the stocks, and order them 6ut of the community,.&#xD;
or hang them to. the nearest tree."&#xD;
"I fear," said Mildmay, " that under a government&#xD;

&#xD;
280            THE MAS~ER'S 'nous~;&#xD;
&#xD;
where- all white men are theoretically free and equal, we&#xD;
planters can never arrogate such power."&#xD;
~The idea of, men' being free and equal is a humbug,&#xD;
Mr. Mildmay;' and I trust you 'will pardon me for saying&#xD;
SG, because the longer I live, the more plainly I see the&#xD;
abeurdity of such a proposition."&#xD;
"Yet I 'must still indulge the idea that such is the&#xD;
fact," continued Mildmay, with the enthusiasm of youth;&#xD;
"because I 'have hope, that our Republican institutions&#xD;
will yet clearly prove the assertion of equality to be true."&#xD;
"Then," said Mr. Moreton, who wa~ now thoroughly&#xD;
excited by his supposititious wrongs, and 'who was rarely&#xD;
differed with in the expression of any opinion-" then 'we&#xD;
must abandon our "Southern rights' to the mercy of peo-&#xD;
ple who have no interest in their conservation."&#xD;
"how so?" said Mildmay, with evident surprise at&#xD;
the proposition.&#xD;
Why," said Mr. Moreton, with earnestness, "look at&#xD;
this selling of liquor to our negroes. The laws against&#xD;
such; ti~affic are as severe., as the English language can&#xD;
make them, ~nd yet they are but dead letters on our&#xD;
statute boo1~s, because the enforcement of these laws is in&#xD;
the ,hands ~f the very men 'who violate ~them. ~I know&#xD;
hat every grog-shop keeper iii Beechland 8ells liquor tQ&#xD;
negroes, and there, are men, otherwise respectable, who&#xD;
make a living by this 6ursed business.&#xD;
"Twa years- before you came. to our neighborhood,&#xD;
myself, with one or two others interested, hired a' cunning&#xD;
fellow to disguise himself 'as a negro (and ho was an excel-&#xD;
lenteounterfeit) fo~ the sole purpose of catching a notorious&#xD;
&#xD;
scamp in the- act of selling ~hi~key to shwe~. The ru~&#xD;
succeeded; the. fellow managed things so adroitly, that he&#xD;
spent an evening in the groggei~y, and found that a whole-&#xD;
sale trade was carried on by this vampire, with negroes&#xD;
belonging to every plantation in the vicinity; that 4~hare&#xD;
was a regular organized system of conveying to his den,&#xD;
from miles around, pieces of machinery, corn, cotton, pigs,&#xD;
silver spoons, chickens, eggs, and what not, that could be&#xD;
easily carried away.&#xD;
Upon this disguised fellow's testimony, we found 4he&#xD;
groggery filled with~articles re~ognizedl as stolen,-.got the&#xD;
thief regularly indicted by the grand jury, and brought to&#xD;
trial; and what; Mr. Mildmay, do you suppose was the&#xD;
result?"&#xD;
"Why, he was convicted of his crimes, and made an&#xD;
example of, inside of the walls of the penitentiary," was&#xD;
the confident answer.&#xD;
"No, sir!" said Mr. Moretom.-." no, sir!. quite the&#xD;
contrary. Why, sir, the groggery keepers of Beechland&#xD;
conspired together, and ran our witness., off, or murdered&#xD;
him,-.I don't know which ~ and they next turned in, and&#xD;
whipped my negroes, and those of, the plai~ters, inter-&#xD;
ested with me in the prosecution; whipped them, ~ir,~and&#xD;
imprisoned them on foolish pretencesr-and pur~ie~d u~,&#xD;
until we were glad to co~npromise by letting the matter&#xD;
drop; No, Mr. Mildrnay I we have not ~ufftcient power to&#xD;
protect our rights against these irresponsible poor whites,&#xD;
who infest, our southernn towns,-places that are, of a.&#xD;
truth, the cankering sores ofour community."&#xD;
"Certainly Beechland is n3t~attractive," replied Mild-&#xD;

may; "and it would appear, from what I have seen, that&#xD;
many of our planters consider when within its precincts,&#xD;
that there is no necessity for self-restraint."&#xD;
"Such is really the fact," said Mr. -Moreton; "if a&#xD;
ma~ wants to gamble, get drunk, run a race) or do any&#xD;
thing 6bjectionable, he goes to Beechland, and always&#xD;
finds kindred spirits to encourage him on: these towns,&#xD;
sir, if it were possible, should be abolished,-the houses&#xD;
razed t~ the ground, and their streets turned into a -cot-&#xD;
ton farm, or a potato-patch.?'&#xD;
"I must there differ. with you," said Mildmay, half&#xD;
jocosely; "I should like to see our Southern villages&#xD;
flourish."&#xD;
"And how could such pestiferous places flourish?"&#xD;
asked-Mr. Moreton, with some curiosity.&#xD;
"Why, most easily Let us encourage1 home indus-&#xD;
try; let us take by the hand the poor, but nevertheless,&#xD;
respectable mechanic, and induce him to settle among us.&#xD;
Let us endeavor, even at an apparent advance of cost, to&#xD;
patronize our own workshops, and we might in that way&#xD;
become gradually independent. I hear too much talk&#xD;
here,. Mr. ]~oreton,, about separation from the North; if&#xD;
such a thing were desirable, at present it is an utter im-&#xD;
p~ssibilityI I heard a stump speech at our last election,&#xD;
made up of denunciations of the free States; and the&#xD;
speaker,- his opponent, proved, in reply, that the Southern&#xD;
rights gentleman )came upon the' ground~ riding a horse&#xD;
raised in Rentucky,-the bridle and blanket were from&#xD;
Ma~saohusetts; the gentleman's hat and boots werel from&#xD;
New Jersey; his. linen' frQm Norwalk~-his coat, vest, -and&#xD;
&#xD;
pantaloons, from New Haveny-both towns i~ Connecti-&#xD;
cut: he made his cluotations in favor of Southern inde-&#xD;
pendence from a paper published in Boston, and, quoted&#xD;
from books printed in New York. Where was the gentle-&#xD;
man's independence, ~f he was thua beholden to people&#xD;
abroad for every necessary of life ? ".&#xD;
Mr. Moreton moved restlessly on his chair at these&#xD;
statements, and after a moment's hesitation, replied.:&#xD;
"What are the people of the North good.. for, but to~&#xD;
be our clothiers and laborers?"&#xD;
"Good for nothing else, I suppose," sai&amp;amp; Mildmay,&#xD;
biting his under lip; "but," he continued, with some-feel-&#xD;
ing, "Mr. Moreton, do not let. us, who ,should set an ex-.&#xD;
ample, encourage such false ideas of -political economy as&#xD;
are inculcated in the hue and cry of 'Southern independ-&#xD;
ence,' when we are, by our practical reAisal t~ diversify&#xD;
our interests, so entirely unprepared for going alone."&#xD;
"Are we not independent ?-" said Mr. Moreton, exces-&#xD;
sively annoyed; "does. not the South furnish the cotton&#xD;
that sustains'~the foreign commerce of our country ? Does&#xD;
not the -South furnish four fifths of the value of the exports&#xD;
of the whole country? isit not our staples that furnish&#xD;
the, chief employment of the rnarineof the North? - Our&#xD;

IMildmay remained- silent,-.and as if sure of -the -jus-&#xD;
tice of: his argument, Mr. - Moreton, after' catching his&#xD;
breath, went on:  -    -              -&#xD;
"Is there an article except our food, used in the South,&#xD;
not wholly, or - in 'part, the product of - Northern- labor;'&#xD;

" And what is your remedy?" asked Mildmay, show-&#xD;
ing an evident desire to be very attentive.&#xD;
"IL would," said Mr. Moreton, triumphantly, "deprive&#xD;
the Yankees of our Southern trade,.-abolish all tariffs,-&#xD;
and seek abroad, and at less cost, for the supplies we now&#xD;
get from our Northern brethren."&#xD;
"Mr. Moreton,"' said Mildmay, solemnly, "like most&#xD;
of our (IL am sorry to say) popular Southern politicians,&#xD;
you have come to the right conclusion, but in the wrong&#xD;
way. IL desire to cut the South loose from its dependence,&#xD;
not only upon the North, but~ upon every thing but its&#xD;
inexhaustible resources. But this glorious result must be&#xD;
reached not by agitation, or popular speeches, but by hard&#xD;
self-sacrificing industry. A blacksmith, my dear sir,&#xD;
pounding upon his anvil from morning until night, in the&#xD;
town of Beechland, would do more for Southern independ-&#xD;
ence, than all the State rights speeches that ever were&#xD;
made. Go abroc~d for our supplies, and not possess a&#xD;
single ship !.~-cut. loose from the North, and no established&#xD;
-manufactures among' us,! Mr. Moreton, young as IL am,&#xD;
IL have reflected deeply upon these things; and unless we&#xD;
cam have towns filled with a thriving, moral population,&#xD;
cordially supported by the planting interest and honored,&#xD;
and not condemned, by' those who cultivate the soil, it is&#xD;
useless to talk of independence; and vain to suppose that&#xD;
the eyils you complain of at IBeechland, will not continually&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mr. Mi'ldmay," said Mr. Moreton, springii~g to his&#xD;
/ feet, and 'pacing up &amp;amp;nd down the gallery; "you seem to&#xD;
lack a proper confidence in the South; IL am surprised to&#xD;
hear a man so deeply interested in its interests as you are,&#xD;
doubt its ability to take care of itself, no matter where its&#xD;
enemies come from."&#xD;
"I doubt not its ability," said Mildmay, with de-&#xD;
cision; "but IL greatly doubt its consistent energy. 'IL&#xD;
have no desire to separate the Union, but IL am willing to&#xD;
do all IL can to i~ender the South commercially free; let&#xD;
us make ourselves independent; and IL am willing, to leave&#xD;
the cementing together of this Great Republic to the&#xD;
strong bonds of mutual iuterest,-to say nothing of being&#xD;
by nature and historical associations really one people,,&#xD;
members of the same family."&#xD;
1~Jr. Moreton - had so long entertained his opinions&#xD;
without opposition, and had so allowed prejudice to ob-&#xD;
scure his naturally superior mind, that while Mildmay's&#xD;
practical arguments had their effect, they' annoyed, as&#xD;
well as convinced; and Mr. Moreton, as a relief, fell back&#xD;
upon the reserved field, where he supposed Mildmay would&#xD;
cordially meet him in his very extreme views, and ab-&#xD;
ruptly said,-&#xD;
"IL never can reason as coolly on these subjects as&#xD;
yourself, sir, so long as IL remember that the North con-&#xD;
stantly interferes with our domestic institutions."&#xD;
"The' North does interfere," said Mildmi~y, a cloud-&#xD;

the institution: and though their intentions may be good,&#xD;
they are none the less practical enemies to the~South."&#xD;
"I wouldn't yield even a prejudice," said Mr. More-&#xD;
ton, now thoroughly excited; "if necessary," he con-&#xD;
tinned, "I would take up arms in defence of our institu-&#xD;
tions. Never, never would I give up, except with my&#xD;
life, even a shadow of right."&#xD;
"I cannot feel 'the force or utility of such feelings,"&#xD;
was' the reply. "I am willing to yield any thing, not of&#xD;
practical value, because I deplore 'agitation;' and al-&#xD;
though IL can sympathize with inconsiderate friends, .yet&#xD;
I am not blind to the evil resulting from their influence.&#xD;
"The fugitive slave law," continued Mildmay, "is&#xD;
founded upon a constitutional basis; yet it is, when enforced&#xD;
at the North, a source of the greatest evil to our good name,&#xD;
and the popular support of our institution. Suppose we do&#xD;
loge negroes,-in my opinion, 'it is more the fault of the na~&#xD;
ture of the property, than the North, that it runs away-let&#xD;
us look upon those that escape, as if it were the same amount&#xD;
of value destroyed by th~ elements, and if we cannot man-&#xD;
age to be insured, let us brave our losses with philosophy.&#xD;
Neither you nor I, Mr. Moreton. nor any Southern gentle-&#xD;
man, would personally pursue a fugitive; we would not&#xD;
have one, when returned to us, upon our plantations; why,&#xD;
&#xD;
then, disturb the harmony of the country, by pursuing a&#xD;
right, the enforcement of which is comparatively of no&#xD;
value, while the poisoning of the public opinion of the&#xD;
North against us, is of immense injury."&#xD;
"And would you suffer our slaves to leave us with&#xD;
impunity,-absolutely invite aggression?" almost gasped&#xD;
Mr. Moreton, in his astonishment at Mildmay's remarks.&#xD;
"No, sir," said Mildmay, with energy, "1 would do&#xD;
nothing of the kind; but what I did do for the protection&#xD;
of our slavery interest should be founded in reason,~-.be&#xD;
practical in its operation,-.ancl accord, as far as might be&#xD;
possible, with tho sentiment not only of the North, but of&#xD;
the world. While I would allow no interference, IL would&#xD;
call that man an enemy of the South who was aggressive.&#xD;
IL would treat slavery purely as a local and domestic insti~&#xD;
tution-and to come back to our original starting~point,&#xD;
by encouraging a diversity of interests in the South, we&#xD;
would find ourselves, as years passed on, less dependent&#xD;
upon the North for our commercial and political prosperity,'&#xD;
and therefore better prepared to remedy the evils of which&#xD;
you complain, and thereby do what is of infinitely more&#xD;
importance, meliorate the condition of the master."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
THE FORMS OF LAW.&#xD;
IT is no more than justice to Major Trimmer, to state,&#xD;
that, as the time for the trial of Toadvine approached, he&#xD;
entered upon his duties with all his souL He had staked&#xD;
a great deal of "reputatioti" upon- a successful issue, and&#xD;
was perhaps more than ever zealous, from- the fact, that&#xD;
there still existed such an "outside pressure" among the&#xD;
substantial. men of the community, against the prisoner;&#xD;
for this operated in the Major's mind as a challenge to&#xD;
extra exertion, acting with more force than even the "due&#xD;
~ ~ "promissory note," and "one half&#xD;
undivided interest in the boy, Jo."&#xD;
The outside of the Court-house indicated an unusual&#xD;
agitation in the public mind; not for years, except at some&#xD;
great political excitement, had there been seen so many&#xD;
horses hitched in its vicinity ; and. there was also noticeable&#xD;
a number of old solid planters in the crowd of gentlemen,&#xD;
* who seldom honored such scenes with their presence. Even&#xD;
1~~Er. Ntoreton, who rarely took a part in public proceedings,&#xD;
evinced great interest on this occasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
Considerable sensation was produced when Gen. Bled-&#xD;
soc and his friends rode up to the court-house. It was&#xD;
noticed that they wore stern expressions, and it was very&#xD;
evident that they had come together, determined to see&#xD;
that there was no ~unfair means used to get Toadvine clear,&#xD;
and that the prosecution should be strengthened by their&#xD;
presence and sympathies. Gen. Bledsoe, and Mildmay,&#xD;
came intp the court-room together, and the crowd respect-&#xD;
fully gave way, to let them pass, as the sheriff showed&#xD;
them seats "inside the bar."&#xD;
Finally there was a great moving of feet, and a sway-&#xD;
ing to and fro of the crowd, and considerable talking and&#xD;
eager staring about, as the deputy sheriff, accompanied by&#xD;
the prisoner, came through a door behind the Judges'&#xD;
bench. Toadvine wore his usually stolid appearance,&#xD;
although he looked a little pale, an effect rather of being&#xD;
for some weeks in confinement, than from any excitement&#xD;
about the result of the trial. Considerable surprise was&#xD;
manifested at the peculiarity of his overcoat, which was&#xD;
made of what was originally a white blanket, with a deep&#xD;
red border, and was so worked up, that this glaring edge&#xD;
formed a border for the skirts, and prominent stripes on&#xD;
the shoulders.&#xD;
"Some one told me," said Gen. Bledsoe to Mildmay,&#xD;
observing this marked coat, " that Toadvine's friends had&#xD;
determined that he should make a break out of the house,&#xD;
in case the trial went against him..-'but with that peculiar&#xD;
coat on, he could 'be spotted,' even in the darkest night."&#xD;
"There is some infernal trick about it," .continued&#xD;
Gen. I3ledsoe, biting the ivoi~'y handle ofhis riding-whip,&#xD;

&#xD;
"you may depend, Milchnay; that coat has not been put&#xD;
on that fellow without some ulterior object."&#xD;
Mildmay looked at the coat, but saw nothing except&#xD;
what was presented to his eye, although he perceived, to&#xD;
his own surprise, that Gen. Bledsoe was evidently in deep&#xD;
study, inspired by its appearance.&#xD;
After what appeared to the impatient spectators a great&#xD;
deal of unnecessary talking between the judge, Major Trim-&#xD;
mer, the prosecuting attorney, and the clerk of the court,&#xD;
the important matter of empanelling the jury commenced.&#xD;
Now Major Trimmer had told Toadvine, that every&#xD;
thing depended upon the complexion of the jury, and that&#xD;
if he could manage to challenge every "dough-face" and&#xD;
church-going man in the county, why he could get him&#xD;
through, without the least possible difficulty.&#xD;
Acting upon this well-defined principle, the regular&#xD;
jurors for ~e term, composed of a certain 'number of citi-&#xD;
zens drawn 1t~idiscriminately from among the voters of the&#xD;
county, were very soon disposed of. As one after another&#xD;
was called to "the stand," a struggle ensued between Maj.&#xD;
Trimmer and the district attorney, and it always appeared,&#xD;
that just in proportion as the State wanted the particular&#xD;
juror, the prisoner didn't want him, and by the construction&#xD;
of the law, the list of regular and responsible jurors was&#xD;
soon exhausted, and every one had been rejected except a&#xD;
small repulsive-looking man, who had slipped in by a deci-&#xD;
sion of the judge, rather than by the wish of either the&#xD;
district attorney or the ever-indefatigable Trimmer.&#xD;
The excitement so far had been quite intense, and the&#xD;
result was considered, on the whole, favorable for the cause&#xD;
&#xD;
of the prisoner. It was perfectly understood, that Trim-&#xD;
mer had accomplished his first object, which was to compel&#xD;
the jury to be made up of talesmen, or persons taken in-&#xD;
discriminately from the hangers-on about the court-house&#xD;
at the time of the trial, and consecj~uently, Major Trimmer&#xD;
waS in ecstasies, and the conservative and well disposed&#xD;
planters, exceedingly cast down.&#xD;
"If it hadn't been for your well-meant, but I fear un-&#xD;
fortunate interference, ~ildmay," said Gen. Bledsoe, his&#xD;
face glowing with disgust at the preliminary proceedings of&#xD;
the trial, "we shouldn't have had to listen to this d-~-d&#xD;
farce enacting before us; Toadvine would have got his de-&#xD;
serts, and honest men their dues," and the general snapped&#xD;
his whip with undisguised impatience.&#xD;
"I cannot think," said Mildmay, for the first time in&#xD;
his life in doubt about the propriety of having done a good&#xD;
action~ "I cannot believe, even with the rejection of o~.r&#xD;
best men as jurors, but that the prisoner must be pun.&#xD;
ished."&#xD;
"It may be so," mechanically answered Gen. Bledsoe,&#xD;
from between his teeth, the while surveying the triumphant&#xD;
looks of Trimmer, and the hopeful face of Toadvine-" it&#xD;
may be so, but depend upon it, if we are juggled out of a&#xD;
conviction by these proceedings, there is a tribunal outside&#xD;
the building, that will not let the prisoner escape."&#xD;
Miidmay remained silent, while the painful scene of&#xD;
the attempted lynching of Toadvine passed in sickening&#xD;
shadows through his mind, and he shuddered~ as if some&#xD;
undefined spirit of evil had breathed its blasting influence&#xD;
upon his inmost soul.&#xD;

THE ?~A5 1~ER'8 HOUSE;&#xD;
&#xD;
The judge 110W squared himself around in his seat,&#xD;
unbuttoned his Arkansas blanket coat, and threw the collar&#xD;
gracefully over his shoulders; and helping himself to a&#xD;
sip of water out of a broken pitcher within his reach, he&#xD;
took a cigar out of his pocket, and was in the act of light-&#xD;
ing it with a lucifer-match, when he recollected that he&#xD;
was "the Court:" so he put the cigar back, and getting a&#xD;
large piece of tobacco from one of the spectators near him,&#xD;
he crowded one half of the appropriated, weed in his&#xD;
mouth, and laid the remainder beside his spectacles; and&#xD;
ordered~ the business of the hour to go on&#xD;
The struggle between the district attorney and Trimmer&#xD;
for the completion of the jury, soon, however, became a&#xD;
one-sided affair. The alternative was left with the State,&#xD;
to have no trial at all-which was quite as agreeable to&#xD;
Toadvine in its resuIt~, as a verdict of not guilty-or to&#xD;
accept for a majority of the members of the jury the very&#xD;
individuals, whom Trimmer had so artfully managed to&#xD;
have conveniently at hand.&#xD;
As the seventh juror took his seat, Trimmer sank&#xD;
back in his chair, seemingly relieved of much anxiety.&#xD;
He had up to this moment wrangled and speechifiedd,"&#xD;
and quoted law-coaxed the judge, bullied the jurors-&#xD;
and gone off occasionally into his stereotyped flights of&#xD;
eloquence, as if he were on the stump; but a benign&#xD;
smile now played upon his lips: it was evident that a load&#xD;
was taken from his mind,-a majority of the jury had&#xD;
been swoi~n in, who were, according to his purpose, the&#xD;
very best men. And, therefQre, relaxing from his severe&#xD;
labor, ho requested a young lawyer-~a~ reThtive of his,&#xD;
&#xD;
A TALE O~ SOUTHERN LIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
293&amp;amp;&#xD;
&#xD;
who was near by-to relieve him for a while of the labor&#xD;
of cross-questioning and challenging.&#xD;
"Don't," said the major, giving his friend a, hint-&#xD;
"don't let a single man on the jury, if you can help it,&#xD;
that has' got a cleanly-shaved face; as a general thing,&#xD;
that kind of peculiarity is good for 'a witness' in a civil&#xD;
case, if he's on your side, but a bad symptom, if you are&#xD;
defending for murder.&#xD;
"Be careful," he added, in the very profuseness of his&#xD;
genius, "not to let slip through your hands any fellow&#xD;
that wears his coat buttoned around his throat so as to&#xD;
conceal his linen, if he has 4any; and be particularly fond&#xD;
of any one whose eyes are inflamed, and bruised a little:&#xD;
and, more than all, don't let a fellow in that's got much&#xD;
forehead. Flat-headed jurors, with all their brains behind&#xD;
their ears, are the thing for murder cases,-recollecj'&#xD;
that;" and the major again relapsed into a momentary&#xD;
quiet.&#xD;
It was, however, useless; the moment that a candidate&#xD;
for the jury was placed under the official crossfire, Major&#xD;
Trimmer was again upon his feet, and performing his dii-&#xD;
ties with characteristic zeal.&#xD;
The eleventh juror had finally taken his place, and the&#xD;
audience had become somewhat fatigued with the same&#xD;
routine' of amusement, when it was discovered that every&#xD;
eligible person present not already sworn in as ~ juror,&#xD;
had been "rejected;" ai~d the Court ordered the sheriff&#xD;
to go literally 'out in the highways and byways for the&#xD;
material to make up the "precious dozen."&#xD;

&#xD;
house, a hard-working and ingenious inechanic-.-~ saddler&#xD;
by trade, who adorned the name of ~Buatt. This per-&#xD;
son never left his shop except on business, and he was&#xD;
often heard to say, "that all he wanted in this world, was&#xD;
plenty of work, and no one to interfere with his attending&#xD;
to it."&#xD;
To Buatt, singular as it may at first appear, the sheriff&#xD;
was the great terror of his life. Not that I3uatt owed a&#xD;
cent in the world,-far from it; he was the model of&#xD;
promptness in the payment of debts ;.-not that he, ever&#xD;
got into brawls, for he was, being truly brave, one of the&#xD;
most quiet men in the community ;-but when the sheriff&#xD;
wanted a juror, and, none could be found, Buatt was hi~&#xD;
last, but certain resource: and in this way, the saddler&#xD;
was defrauded of his time, and consequently, out of his&#xD;
money.&#xD;
This sacrifice of Buatt to the public had become in Beech-&#xD;
land a standing joke, for there was rarely a tedious trial&#xD;
in prospect, but that the poor fellow was subpoenaed as a&#xD;
juror, until, finally, in self-defence, h~ had laid it down as&#xD;
a solemn principle, to "hang," every jury he might be on;&#xD;
and to such an extent, in his grievances, had he carried&#xD;
t~is determination, that Buatt looked upon all trials as&#xD;
mere farces, to involve him in annoyances,-rob clients of&#xD;
their money, and jurymen of their time,.-and nothing&#xD;
more; the solemnity and importance that should attach to&#xD;
them had long since passed from his mind.&#xD;
On the occasion of the "Toadvine trial,". he. was as&#xD;
usual hard at work in his shop,-a great many little jobs&#xD;
naturally coming in, from the unusual crowd of people&#xD;
&#xD;
about the eourt-house,-when the deputy sheriff laid an&#xD;
order before him, to attend the Court. On ordinary occa-&#xD;
sions he would have been furious at such a summons, but&#xD;
never dreaming how much he was needed, he concluded to&#xD;
"step around," go through the form of being "qualified,"&#xD;
and then be dismissed with the usual laugh, and thus be&#xD;
left quietly to attend to his business; and in this humor,&#xD;
and much to the surprise of the "deputy," Buatt with&#xD;
alacrity left his work-bench, and' accompanied the offleer of&#xD;
the Court.&#xD;
When the saddler presented himself, a general laugh&#xD;
ensued: ~"There's the old stand-by," whispered one;&#xD;
"lie's part of the law," suggested another; and this f~eel-&#xD;
ing finally burst forTh in loud applause. The sheriff&#xD;
looked out of the window, cried "Silence!" and the legal&#xD;
dispute began.&#xD;
Buatt still feeling perfectly conscious that he would be&#xD;
rejected, and Major Trimmer and the district attorney&#xD;
being under the same delusion, two or three questions&#xD;
were asked, which Buatt answered in a careless manner,&#xD;
when, to the astonishment of every person, the judge&#xD;
accepted of Buatt as a ~~o~,-the mutual challenges of&#xD;
the two lawyers to the contrary notwithstanding.&#xD;
The evident annoyance of the "victim," ashe took his&#xD;
seat, was irresistibly comic; and as he completed the jury,&#xD;
another round of applause was given, which ~" the Court,"&#xD;
with a singularly bland smile, desired would not again be&#xD;
repeated,-but which desire was instantly disregarded, as&#xD;
Buatt arose, and addressing the judge by his given name,&#xD;
said,.-~-&#xD;

"Order I order!" cried the sheriff,, while the judge&#xD;
suddenly burying hi~ face in a law book, pretended not to&#xD;
have heard the expression, so much calculated to infringe&#xD;
upon his dignity.&#xD;
A few moments of confusion followed, as the specta~&#xD;
tors sighed out their relief that the jury was at length em-&#xD;
panell~J, and that a new act would commence, of what&#xD;
General Bledsoe now pronounced to be, a "contemptible&#xD;
legal farce."&#xD;
The judge now asked if the parties interested in "The&#xD;
State 'vs. Toadvine," were ready for trial; and being&#xD;
answered in the affirmative, with some other very unmean-&#xD;
iug preliminaries, the clerk proceeded to read the usual in.&#xD;
dictment.&#xD;
The district attorney then rose, and "opened the case."&#xD;
lie briefly and clearly stated to the jury the nature of the&#xD;
crime charged against the prisoner, declaring, that al-&#xD;
though the person murdered~ was civilly treated as pro-&#xD;
perty, he was as to crimes and offences considered as a&#xD;
person. He further defined murder to be, according to&#xD;
Sir Edward. Coke, "when a person of sound memory&#xD;
and discretion unlawfully killeth any reasonable creature,&#xD;
being in, and under, the king's peace, with malice afore-&#xD;
thought,. either express or implied." The district attor-&#xD;
ney 'then stated the facts of the ease, and said, that he&#xD;
believed he eQuld prove them by an unusual array ~f truth-&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
THE TESTIMONY.&#xD;
THE first witness called was the jailer. Upon the an-&#xD;
nouncement of his name by the sheriff, he promptly made&#xD;
his appearance; and as he was so often a witness in one&#xD;
way and another, he looked around as complacently as the&#xD;
"Court" itself. The clerk held out the Bible, on which&#xD;
the jailer in a professional manner placed hi~ hand, when&#xD;
the subordinate official said, "Mr. Orcutt, you swear be-&#xD;
fore Almighty God, and these witnesses, that you will&#xD;
e-l-d-h-a-r-truth-p-s-d-r-u-m-c-l-w-s-d-i-y-and-r-t-v-u-a-h-e-r,"&#xD;
whereupon Mr. Orcutt delicately kissed his own fingers,&#xD;
instead of the book, the district attorney, in a solemn voice,&#xD;
then asked:&#xD;
"Mr. Orcutt, you are jailer of Beechland, I believe?"&#xD;
"That's the understanding, considering you have ki~own&#xD;
the fact for eleven years," said Orcutt, with a grin.&#xD;
"May it please the Court," said the major, swinging&#xD;
round his arms, in sympathy with a burst of eloquence&#xD;
which he could, but did not utter; "may it please the&#xD;
Court, that the witness answers in a respectful manner."&#xD;
"The Court" temporarily relieved its' mouth of a&#xD;

&#xD;
large amount of half-masticated "Old Kaintuck," and&#xD;
said, "that it was expected, and he hoped the gentleman&#xD;
would understand, that -," and the rest of the&#xD;
Court's remarks were lost in the sheriffss crying "Si-&#xD;
lence !" on account of a horse "squealing" on the outside&#xD;
of the building.&#xD;
Mr. Orcutt went on :-~" Mr. Toadvine come to me&#xD;
just at dark for the boy Jack, and I delivered him up,&#xD;
knowii~g Mr. Toadvine to be Mr. Mildmay's overseer."&#xD;
The jailer then gave his version of Toadvine's taking the&#xD;
negro out of the jail,-leaving the impression on the mind&#xD;
of the jury, however, that Toadvine did it in the most&#xD;
considerate manner; at the same' time, he was most posi-&#xD;
tive that after be closed the jail door, he knew nothing-..&#xD;
saw nothing, of Toadvine's actions or treatment of the&#xD;
negro. The piece of rope that was found round Jack's&#xD;
neck, was acknowledged by Orcutt to be of the same coil&#xD;
in his possession.&#xD;
"Was the prisoner intoxicated at the time he came&#xD;
for Jack ?" asked the district attorney, supposing that&#xD;
Major Trimmer had done with the witness.&#xD;
"I object to that question!" said Major Trimmer,&#xD;
'looking very fierce.&#xD;
"If the Court please," returned the district attorney,&#xD;
"I will finish my examination uninterrupted, and then&#xD;
hand the witness over to the defence."&#xD;
"Was the prisoner intoxicated, Mr. Orcutt?" repeated&#xD;
the district attorney.&#xD;
Orcutt looked confused. "Remember you are under&#xD;
oath!" suggested "his honor," picking his teeth with a&#xD;
jack-knife.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mr. Toadvine was slightly, very slightly elevated!"&#xD;
said Oreutt, after much hesitation.&#xD;
" What do you mean by 'elevated,' Mr. Orcutt?"&#xD;
asked the district attorney, appearing entirely at a loss as&#xD;
to the witness's meaning.&#xD;
Orcutt scratched his head, looked despairingly around,&#xD;
stared at Major Trimmer, then at the Court, and finally&#xD;
said: "By 'elevated,' I mean that Mr. Toadvine 'felt&#xD;
well.'"&#xD;
The district attorney now "begged" the Court to or-&#xD;
der the witness to answer the question direct, and he again&#xD;
repeated it, with unusual emphasis on the word 'intoxi-&#xD;
cated.'&#xD;
"Perhaps," said Orcutt, "he bought have been 'con-&#xD;
siderable,' and he bought not-people as stay at the&#xD;
'Head-quarters' all the afternoon, if they participate&#xD;
at all, get somewhat 'anti-fogmatic,' but not always.&#xD;
Toadvine was 'straight,' now I remember, for we tossed&#xD;
coppers for an odd quarter (great sensation with Major&#xD;
Trimmer), and Toadvine knew which side his bread was&#xD;
buttered, as quick as the soberest man as ever was in&#xD;
Beechland."&#xD;
"You can go 1" said the district attorney, who, catch-&#xD;
ing Gen. Bledsoe's eye at the instant, assumed a loQk of&#xD;
disgust at Orcutt's evident unwillingness to state a single&#xD;
fact.&#xD;
"You perceive, gentleman of the jury," now chimed&#xD;
in Major Trimmer, "that the prosecutor's own witness ac-&#xD;
knowledges that Mr. Toadvine was 'straight,' when he went&#xD;
for the negro boy Jack."&#xD;

"Why didn't Orcutt say Toadvine was drunk, a~&#xD;

for morei than a hundred yards in. the soft mud, and the&#xD;
appearance of the body itself, that it had been dragged&#xD;
swiftly all~ that long distance. He further stated, th~t 'he&#xD;
assisted' with his oWn hands in taking the rope off' of the&#xD;
decea~4's 'neck, and that he found the spinal column&#xD;
not only broken from the base of the skull, but that. the&#xD;
muscles of the neck had 'been extraordinarily, stretched,&#xD;
while in the act of sustaining the dragging weight of the&#xD;
body. As"~Gen~ ~ledsoe was a very wealthy man,' and&#xD;

at the time."&#xD;
"Do YOU not consider that Mr. Toadvine was unneces-&#xD;
sarily severe, as an overseer?" asked the district attorney.&#xD;
"If I had so thought him to be," answered Mildmay,&#xD;
"I should not have employed him on my place. It was&#xD;
not until since he left me, that I have become aware of the&#xD;
difficulties he had in managing my negroes. Without&#xD;
wishing to interfere with proper discipline," continued&#xD;
Mildmay, "I must think that Mr. Toadvine was not always&#xD;
considerate, and that he acted frequently from impulses&#xD;
which overcame his judgment."&#xD;
Two witnesses, much to Major Trimmer's astonish-&#xD;
ment, were now brought in by the district attorney, who&#xD;
testified, that they saw a man on the night of the murder,&#xD;
going out of Beechland, with a negro tied by a rope&#xD;
around the neck, following close behind his horse; but&#xD;
neither would say positively, that it~. was Toadvine. In&#xD;
fact, the both exhibited great consternation, and seemed&#xD;
to be afraid of committing themselves against the prisoner,&#xD;
being possessed of an idea in their minds, that the law was&#xD;
powerless to protect them against the vengeance of Toad-&#xD;
vine's friends, in case he was convicted on their testimony;&#xD;
and beyond the fact, that they saw a man going out of&#xD;
town with a negro, on the night of the murder, nothing&#xD;
positive was elicited.&#xD;
Major Trimmer (who had been nervously watching the&#xD;
progress of the trial, and was exceedingly embarrassednot&#xD;
only by the testimony, but also by the respectability of the&#xD;
witnesses, which kept him from displaying his favorite&#xD;

THE MASTER'S HOt~S1~2~&#xD;
&#xD;
science of cross-questioning and annoying them), nOw took&#xD;
the case, for the moment, in his own hands, and brought&#xD;
forward his witnesses.&#xD;
The first witness for the defence was Stubbs~ the owner&#xD;
of the negro-catching dogs. He took his place at the&#xD;
stand, and went through the, to him, unnecessary farm of&#xD;
an oath; and was requested by Major Trimmer, to be so&#xD;
kind as to state to the jury what he knew of the boy Jack.&#xD;
Stubbs, who had been by Major Trimmer designedly&#xD;
kept in the bar-room of the "Head-quarters," until Mild-&#xD;
may's testimony had been given, got up, perfectly prepared&#xD;
to answer Major Trimmer's leading questions, without re-&#xD;
gard to their meaning or effect, which would not have been&#xD;
the case, had he known all the particulars; for he knew&#xD;
he was dependent upon the planters for his business, and&#xD;
therefore did not like to offend them. As it was, Major&#xD;
Trimmer "pumped" Stubbs to his heart's content, and~&#xD;
concluded as follows:&#xD;
"It has been stated, Mr. Stubbs, that Jack was a very&#xD;
good negro. When you arrested him, what took place?"&#xD;
"Why you see," said Stulbs, counting the end8 of hi~&#xD;
fingers in his embarrassment, "you see, that I thinks all&#xD;
runaways is dangerous. Why? 'cause they mostly go&#xD;
armed with bodiess."'&#xD;
"Exactly so!" said Major Trimmer; highly delighted.&#xD;
"All runaways are dangerous, gentlemen of ,the jury, and&#xD;
wear 'bawies,'-please remember that, gentlemen!" and&#xD;
thus saying, the major requested Stubbs to go on.&#xD;
~ I war4't, when I cotch't Jack, if that was his name,&#xD;

trailing' for old Phil Spartan's 'Juba George,' as has been&#xD;
out nigh on to a year already, and has some way of de.&#xD;
ceivin' the dogs, or keeping' them from tarin' him down."&#xD;
"Never mind about that,~ now!" said the district at-&#xD;
torney, sort of waking up.&#xD;
"As I said, I was a trailing' for 'Juba George,' when&#xD;
Tiger opened on a hot scent, and Terror gave a yelp as&#xD;
made me yell with pride at the dog's smartness; and the&#xD;
hull pack. commenced singing beautiful, and running , along&#xD;
as true as a bee-l~e, when what should turn up but this&#xD;
'ere nigger as died, when Mr. Toadvine was a takin' him&#xD;
home."&#xD;
"Address the jury!" said the ~Court, unfolding out of&#xD;
a sort of stupid doze.&#xD;
"As I was saying," continued Stubbs, turning to the&#xD;
jury, and now becoming quite interested, "the dogs was&#xD;
a running' as fine as a ha'r, when this Jack sprung ~up,&#xD;
leaped like a deer over a tree, gave a yell and was off; but&#xD;
it was no go, he come to bay in fiv&amp;amp; minutes, and fou't&#xD;
beautiful; I think Tige' broke out one of his front teeth&#xD;
a holding' on, and ]3rtdscr got crippled for a week, and if&#xD;
that ain't a dangersome nigger, I'd like to see one as is."&#xD;
"Then you think," said Major Trimmer, with a slow,&#xD;
hesitating voice, "that this boy, Jack, was really of bad&#xD;
character, and would resist if even proper discipline was&#xD;
enforced upon him?"&#xD;
"I think I've tuck many niggers as guy up easier than&#xD;
him."&#xD;
The sheriff then called Mr. Busteed, and the proprie-&#xD;
tor of the well-known "Head-quarters" presented himself.&#xD;

804             THE MASTER'S HOUSE;&#xD;
&#xD;
It was a saying among the younger members of the&#xD;
bar, that Busteed was a "standing witness," and Buatt,&#xD;
a "permanent juryman," and that the two ought~ to enter&#xD;
into business together, in these official capacities, and get&#xD;
a heavy sa1ary~for their services. The fact was, that most&#xD;
difficulties in ]3eechland commenced at the "Head-quar-&#xD;
ters," or could be traced directly to that popular place of&#xD;
resort, consequently, Busteed's testimony was always ne-&#xD;
cessary, and what was most unaccountable to people . of&#xD;
weak minds, he was always on the part of the "prose-&#xD;
cuted," or as he said, "taking up for theTm as was imposed&#xD;
on by the law."&#xD;
"Was Mr. Toadvine intoxicated on the evening that he&#xD;
took Jack out of jail ?" asked Major Trimmer.&#xD;
"How can I tell when a man's 'toxicated?" replied&#xD;
]3usteed, with the air of an injured man.&#xD;
"But you must have some notion of such a thing 1"&#xD;
suggested Major Trimmer.&#xD;
"Not a bit of it!" said Busteed, with a confident air,&#xD;
at the same time lolling against the front of the judge's&#xD;
stand. "People that are fools enough to drink &amp;amp;td. liquor&#xD;
will g~t sick, and that's what I tells my custQmers when-&#xD;
ever I see 'em going to 'imbibe' at places they don't know&#xD;
about; besides, how can I know when a man's intoxi-&#xD;
cated,-4har's Judge Burley can carry just as much as he&#xD;
can git down, without a winking , and then there's others as&#xD;
will keel up at the first glass."&#xD;
," I wish to know whether Mr. Toadvine left your house&#xD;
sober, or 'not?" said -Major Trimmer, affecting (as had&#xD;
&#xD;
been previously arranged With flusteecl), to be very much&#xD;
irritated at the witness's evasions.&#xD;
"Mr. Toadvine left- my house as sober. as any gentle-&#xD;
men do, and always does, and would!" replied Busteed,&#xD;
authoritatively.&#xD;
"Wasn't he-much annoyed on the evening referred to,&#xD;
by losses at cards?" asked the district attorney, looking&#xD;
at a piece of paper 1~nded t~ him by sen. ]Jledsoe.&#xD;
"1 demand protection of the Court for my client!"&#xD;
exclaimed Major Trimmer, with great animation. "Pro~&#xD;
tection, may it please your honor, from inquisitorial and&#xD;
improper questions. Whether or no my client plays cards,&#xD;
is a private affair,--and the witness should not answer."&#xD;
The judge, who, as we have before hinted, was getting&#xD;
very sleepy, on account of not being able to smoke while&#xD;
on the bench, and who had been, half the whole time of&#xD;
the proceedings, almost oblivious to what was going on be-&#xD;
fore him, now roused himself, and discharging his tobacco&#xD;
on the floor, and tasting of the water~ before him,~ as if it~&#xD;
primitive purity was nauseating to the last degree, he put.&#xD;
on his spectacles in a careful manner, looked Busteed full&#xD;
in the face, and solemnly said:&#xD;
"The Court will see that not only the. witnesses are&#xD;
protected, but also that the bar and the bench are re-&#xD;
spected."&#xD;
This sudden ebullition of official digjiity had a great&#xD;
effect on the spectators; many of themstopped talking and&#xD;
laughing, and things would for the moment have been&#xD;
quiet calm and dignified, had not the sheriff startled the&#xD;

cr0wd by bawling at the ~t6p of his voice, "Silence! Si.&#xD;

The worthy jailer at the sound came rushing out of&#xD;
the "ll&amp;amp;~adjuaxter~," where he had be~u looking after&#xD;
Busteed's customers, while that gentleman was "legally&#xD;
engaged~' and, mounting the witnesses' stand, almost en.&#xD;
timely out of breath, he wiped his lips with his coat-sleeve,&#xD;
and observed to the ~clerk, that "he was ready to take a&#xD;
The clerk reminded Mr. Orcutt that he was still under&#xD;
the weighty responsibility of an oath, as a witness in the&#xD;
case of the State 'v. Toadvine, and that the form alluded&#xD;
to would not lie ~repeated.&#xD;
"Mr. Orcutt," said MajQr Trimmer, rising. with dig-&#xD;
nity, and~ opening a volume of Blackstone, which he held&#xD;
upside down hi his hands; Mr. Orcutt, please state to this&#xD;
lionorable jury, whether or no the boy~ Jack was sick while&#xD;
under your charge in jail?"&#xD;
'~ ~e, wasn't sick as I knows on," returned the witness,&#xD;
eyein~ Trimmer intently, as much as to ask, "Why didn't&#xD;
you~ post me up before the trial on this point ?.-what ~re&#xD;
you driving at?"&#xD;
"You say," said Major Trimmer, looking very earnest,&#xD;
and seizing a pen, that the, boy was not sick'?"&#xD;
"No, I don't, though," ~said Orcutt, brightening "up;&#xD;
"' I' don't say nothing of the kind, because I wouldn't say&#xD;
undei~ o~th of niggers in. jail, that the wellest-looking of&#xD;
them wasn't sick~"&#xD;
"Then th~re' is a great deal of sickness in the jail ?"&#xD;
"Why, generally thar ~is 'mona the runaways when&#xD;
&#xD;
306.-&#xD;
&#xD;
they first come in~ for' although they get 'better victuals&#xD;
with us, they get less air and exercise."&#xD;
"And the boy Jack suffered as.others do?"&#xD;
"He did complain of the dQg-bite on the calf of his&#xD;
leg, but nothing more, as I recollect."&#xD;
"Are you sure, Mr. Orcutt, that none of the prisoners&#xD;
were sick with cholera'?"&#xD;
The jailer reflected for a few seconds, and said "that&#xD;
he believed one of the prisoners was troubled that way;&#xD;
but which one, he didn't know:" and with this answer,&#xD;
he retired.&#xD;
"Colonel Price!" shouted the sheriff.;' and the name&#xD;
was no sooner uttered, than that portly worthy presented&#xD;
himself. Major Trimmer, who seemed to be very much&#xD;
delighted with "the colonel's" appearance, asked the wit-&#xD;
ness&#xD;
"Do you think, Colonel Price, that Mr. Toadvine is a&#xD;
mild or a severe man with niggers ?"&#xD;
"Mild-very mild," replied the ~colbnel.&#xD;
"What reason, Colonel Price, have you for declaring&#xD;
Mr. Toadvine to be 'mild-very mild?'"&#xD;
"'Cause he'd let niggers off for nothing that 'ud get&#xD;
staked down by me, and have forty," replied the~ colonel,&#xD;
flushing with excitement.&#xD;
"Colonel Price," said the district attorney, "do you&#xD;
know any thing about the defendant's whipping th~ deceased&#xD;
before he ran away?"&#xD;
"Who's defendant,-and what's deceased?" asked the&#xD;
colonel, an idea passing through his mind that the district~&#xD;

attorney was quizzing him, because he was not a "college.&#xD;
educated" man.&#xD;
"I mean," said the district attorney, "did Mr. Toad-&#xD;
vine ever whip Jack to~your knowledge ?"&#xD;
"Sartain he did," said' the colonel, looking very&#xD;
blank; "sartain he did, and by my advice, too,."&#xD;
Major Trimmer ~was again upon his feet, and with a&#xD;
loud voice he appealed to the Court~ to know,, if witnesses&#xD;
were obliged to answer questions relating to their private&#xD;
business, particularly gentlen~ien overseers, regarding their&#xD;
puni~ment of negroes.&#xD;
Price thought that Trimmer asked him the question,&#xD;
and he vehemently replied:&#xD;
"I rather think I ain't obliged to answer any ques-&#xD;
tions~that I don't want to, and you may depend on that."&#xD;
"The Court" seemed very much delighted with it~&#xD;
temporary mouth-piece.&#xD;
"flow much was Jack whipped by Mr.~Toadvine on&#xD;
your suggestion, Colonel Price ? " pursued the district&#xD;
attorney.&#xD;
"Just as much," replied the colonel, "as Toadvine&#xD;
had grease in his back to work his arms with; and since&#xD;
you want to know so many particulars," said the colonel,&#xD;
turning to the district attorney, "II would just say, that&#xD;
if any man gets out a 'diotment agin me for killing a nig.&#xD;
ger, I'll. cutj.his -"&#xD;
"Silence ! " said the sheriff ;-.." Take him out 1" cried&#xD;
the lawyers; "Go it, old colonel !" vociferated the "out-&#xD;

" Oh, come out of the court-I want to tell you some-&#xD;
thing," whispered the officious.. deputy.&#xD;
Price gazed upon the speaker vacantly, for he was&#xD;
very much intoxicated, and wa]k~d quietly through, the&#xD;
crowd into the street. Quiet being restored, it was. an-&#xD;
nounced that " the defence was closed." .&#xD;
Meanwhile, Gen. Bled8oe and the particular. friends&#xD;
who came with him to Beechiand in the morning, for~ned&#xD;
a group by themselves, and seemed in angry conference.&#xD;
Expressions of contempt for The whole proceedings of the&#xD;
trial were to be heard, reminding one of the muttering of&#xD;
a coming storm; the, judge was denounced as one of&#xD;
"Busteed's right-hand men,"-.--the jury, as "a set of packed&#xD;
rascals,"-the. district attorney, as "an ass,"-.~-and Trim-&#xD;
mer, "as a parasite upon 'the community in which he&#xD;
lived."&#xD;
Mildmay, who had left .home~ at the cost of 'n6glecting&#xD;
important ~business that required his personal attention;.&#xD;
and feeling sorely disgusted at all he had witnessed, called&#xD;
Gen. Bledsoe apart, stated the faots, and announced his&#xD;
intention of returning home at once. -&#xD;
"I would go by all means," said Gen. Bleds~oe1 with-&#xD;
out hesitation, "if my presence were needed elsewhere.&#xD;
You now see, Mr. Mildmay," exclaimed the general; with&#xD;
some feeling, ~"that that scoundrel, Toadvine, will cheat&#xD;

&#xD;
take the law into our own hands, if we would not have it&#xD;
'~violated with impunity."&#xD;
"It is a fearful alternative," sighed Mildmay; and&#xD;
cordially shaking Gem Bledsoe by the hand, he musingly&#xD;
pursued his way to Heritage Place.&#xD;
/ Some little excitement existed among the spectators&#xD;
preceding the "opening of the prosecution." After a few&#xD;
general remarks, the district attorney, who was quite a&#xD;
young man, said&#xD;
"The defendant stands charged with murder. In ac-&#xD;
cordance with just mercy, the laws of Louisiana make no&#xD;
invidions distinctions against the negro, when we come to&#xD;
the protection of his life; and the white man, who with&#xD;
malice aforethought, wilfully kills the humblest slave, has&#xD;
committed in the eye of the law the highest crime known&#xD;
t6 our statutes.'&#xD;
"In all cases of death by violence, 'the law presumes&#xD;
it to be done in malice until the contrary be proved: this&#xD;
is so construed for the protection of life. If, therefore,&#xD;
you are satisfied that the killing was done with malice,&#xD;
and find no e~teniiating circumstances, you cannot do less&#xD;
than what the' law demands of you.&#xD;
"In the operation of our police regulations, a negro&#xD;
is commit ted to jail; in due course of time, the overseer&#xD;
calls at the place of the slave's confinement~-.'.-obtains pos-&#xD;
session of him,.-.ties' one end of a rope around the slave's&#xD;
neck, and the other to the pommel of his saddle .-.and&#xD;
before a half mile is accomplished, the negro becomes ex-&#xD;
hausted, is ~dragged through the mud for more than a~hun-&#xD;
&#xD;
dred yards, and is then cut loose, and left in the road,&#xD;
being perfectly dead.&#xD;
"The peculiar character of our institutions requires.&#xD;
that the master ~should necessarily delegate a great deal of&#xD;
power to his confidential agent-i--the overseer; but that&#xD;
authority is to be exerted wisely, and, except in extreme&#xD;
cases, violence is not~~to be used. I am sorry to say, gen-&#xD;
tlemen, that the abuse of power by overseers is becoming&#xD;
too common; it is a source of alarm to the thinking peo-&#xD;
ple of the community, that there is exhibited a grow~.ng&#xD;
wantonness in the sacrifice of this species of property, and(&#xD;
the consequent shedding of human blood. Unless, gentle-&#xD;
men, we protect our slaves,'-.-unless the strong arm of the&#xD;
law is exerted toshield them from the acath-dealing influ-&#xD;
ences of irresponsible white men, society among us will.&#xD;
rapidly degenerate into barbarism, and there will settle&#xD;
down upon us a cloud deeper and more terrible than that&#xD;
which once overwhelmed ~gypt.&#xD;
"You have, also, gentlemen, a duty~ to perform, 'which&#xD;
should be one to you of serious consideration. There are&#xD;
fanatics at the North, whe make it their unrighteous busi-&#xD;
ness to vilify and misrepresent the South. It is such&#xD;
cases, as we have here to-day presented, that give founda-&#xD;
tion to the misrepresentations. we have alluded to; and&#xD;
we are bound, as we wish to have, our community protected&#xD;
by the powerful' support of the sanction of good men of&#xD;
every land, to punish those who would give force to the&#xD;
odium that is heaped upon us. We must let no more&#xD;

will 'they~fall harmless to thea ground.&#xD;
"The most responsible,-.--the most honorable men of&#xD;
our community, have given in their testimo~iy to-day.' It&#xD;
has been shown by Mr. Orcutt, that the accused 'tied the&#xD;
deceased with a rope around the neck previous to the leav-&#xD;
'ing of the jail; it has been proven that the prisoner was&#xD;
seen leaving the town at dusk,-the negro following close&#xD;
in the rear. It has been shown by the testimony of such&#xD;
gentlemen as General Bkdsoe, and otl~ers of 'equal moral&#xD;
veracity, that the deceased was found in the road, his neck&#xD;
b~ukeii, and with all the corresponding marI~s of a fearful&#xD;
murder..&#xD;
"Mr. Mildmay, the owner of the deceased, states dis-&#xD;
tinetly, that the victim' of brutality was unexceptionable&#xD;
~in character; and although a family servant, grown up&#xD;
under his own eye, yet no recollection was had that the&#xD;
deceased was ever struck a blow for insubo~dinati6n, 'or&#xD;
any other cause of ~lisobedience whatever. In view of all&#xD;
.',these facts, gentlemen, it is for you to vindicate the sin-&#xD;
cerity' of our laws, passed for the protection of the slave,&#xD;
and' show those who are willing to trample them under&#xD;
foot, tha1~ it cannot be done ~vith impunity. Spurn not&#xD;
the cries of blood that come 'from the ground, ~because that&#xD;
blood flowed from the heart of a poor African slave. Re-&#xD;
member that the eye of Heaven is no respecter of persons;&#xD;

very fact, that, the murdered victim was helpless~-.--was&#xD;

&#xD;
abe; but a desire to render oheerf~ul obedience to his su-&#xD;
periors; with no one to avenge hi~ wrongs, but the de-&#xD;
cision of a conscientious and enlightened jury."&#xD;
There was no applause expressed at the conclusion of&#xD;
the district attorney's speech, for, as Puckett said ~o Bus-&#xD;
teed, "there was nothing in it to make a nian yelp."&#xD;
The moment, however~ that 'it was ani~iounced that Major&#xD;
Trimmer was "' to begin the defence,'~ there w~,as great&#xD;
excitement among the spectators. The bar-room 'of the&#xD;
"Head-quarters" was vacated in a 'moment by quite a&#xD;
number of individuals wh~ had foun~l the C( prosecution&#xD;
tedious," but' who were very anxious to hear the "scath-&#xD;
ing eloquence" of ~' the most distinguished crimin~l'lawyer&#xD;
in the district."&#xD;
It was perfectly understood that the major 'would&#xD;
"exalt himself" on this particular 'occasion. lie was al-&#xD;
ways a candidate for political honors, and, as in law prac~.&#xD;
tice, was' always on either one side or another, and as an&#xD;
election wa~ near at hand, he had expressed to an intimate&#xD;
friend the opinion, that he thought' he might take advan~&#xD;
tage of his defence of Toadvine' to say something so harid~&#xD;
some of the overseers as a body, that he could secure ~their&#xD;
influence at the polls.&#xD;
The major began by saying, ~kthat he felt deeply the&#xD;
fearful responsibility, resting upon 'him, b~it ~that he was&#xD;
afraid that his astonishment at the fact of his client being&#xD;
tried at all for killing the negro Jack, would overcome&#xD;

most influential citizens.&#xD;
"Gentlemen of the jury, who is my client? I answ~r,~&#xD;
a person I have long known, and been intimate with;&#xD;
an individual, who forms one of the bright galaxy of over-&#xD;
seers-those noble men, who control our servile popula-&#xD;
tion,-~-~-who brave the heats of a tropical sun in 'the per-&#xD;
formance of ~their arduous duties,-~--who sleep at night&#xD;
beside their arms, to be ready~ to defend whom-them-&#xD;
selves? No, gentlemen of the jury, to defend their em-&#xD;
ployers-the lordly plan~ters-from insubordination and&#xD;
insurrection; a olassof men, who risk their life daily, and&#xD;
take a stun of' money as remuneration, which would be as&#xD;
nothing, if. they were not inspired by patriotism,-were&#xD;
not philanthrQpists by trade; of such, gentlemen, is Sylva-&#xD;
mis Toadvine, who now sits before you. And this is the&#xD;
man, possessed of so many admirable q~ialities, who has&#xD;
&#xD;
been by 'the most unwarrantable legal proceedings incar-&#xD;
cerated in~ a common jail,~and' left to linger out a miser-&#xD;
able existence, for' what ?-for what, I say, gentlemen?&#xD;
Simply, because, a dead negro was found in the same road,&#xD;
that my respected clier~t passed over on, his way to Mr.&#xD;
Mildmay's plantation.&#xD;
"My legal brother, the district attorney, 'has stated,&#xD;
that it was proven beyond a doubt, that a negro had been&#xD;
killed. Where is~ the authority for such a presumption?&#xD;
It has been shown past contradiction. that a negro was&#xD;
dead, which negro, as I shall show, probablydied~o~ a fatal&#xD;
disorder, from what is termed a natural cause; and no&#xD;
personal violence had any thing to do ~with the case:&#xD;
"Now what are the facts? ~Simply these. The de-&#xD;
fendant is overseer on a large plantation; he has the con-&#xD;
trol of sixty or eighty brutalized Africans, who~ require&#xD;
his constant attention; he has contracted with their~mas-&#xD;
ter to cultivate a certain amount of land, ~nd produce a&#xD;
fixed. number of bales of cotton. To do this, and escape&#xD;
losing the reputation 'of a business inan,~ the overseer labors&#xD;
night and day, and is properly intrusted with the sole con-&#xD;
trol and management of the slave gang.&#xD;
"The overseer knows well the disposition of the negro,&#xD;
and while the master is~ treading, with dainty steps, his&#xD;
marble halls, the faithful overseer is winding his devious&#xD;
way 'thrQugh interminable swamps; while 'the master is&#xD;
lounging upon the delicate ethereal spring~.paade ottoman,&#xD;
the overseer makes his couch upon the hard, cold ground;&#xD;
while the master is indulging in the 'delights of the ta&#xD;
groaning beneath the luxuries of every clime, the wers&#xD;

is frugally eating his meal of bacon and greens; while the&#xD;
master sees his negroes fat, ~lcek, happy, and idle;: the&#xD;
overseer beholds them as the necessary objects,. Qf strict&#xD;
discipline, and is forced' to make them do their work~&#xD;
." Therefore, gentlemen of the jury, when. the ownei~&#xD;
of a~negro comes into court, and under oath declares that&#xD;
negro to have beenwithout a fault,-to have been well-be-&#xD;
htvved and, harmless, that owner acts conscientiously, be-&#xD;
lieves what he says, speaks what he thinks is true; but the&#xD;
overseer, gentlemen, can alone know the faets,-one word&#xD;
from Col. Price, a disinterested and capable witness, as to&#xD;
the outrageous insubdrdination of the deceased, is worth&#xD;
whole volumes of presumption from the good-natured, and&#xD;
where the affections are concerned, easily deceived master.&#xD;
Having satisfied you, gentlemen '(as a mere incident), of&#xD;
the savage and barbarous character of this negro, Jack,&#xD;
for it is not necessary for me, in any way to strengthen the&#xD;
defence, to dwellupon the subject, I will examine the testi-&#xD;
mony adduced fo~ die attempted proof, that he died by the&#xD;
hand's of my injured client.&#xD;
~C J~ is stated by Mr. Orcutt, that Mr. Toadvine left&#xD;
the jail with Jack; and two respectable witnesses~ swear&#xD;
that they saw a ~nan, on 4he eveningg of'the murder,' going&#xD;
out of Beechlai~id, a negro following at his horse's heels,&#xD;
with 'a. r6pe tied round his neck.&#xD;
"Well', gentlemen of the jury, I have had some prac-&#xD;
tice in criminal cases,,but I never have had so weak a one&#xD;
before 'to defend., Nr. Orcutt says that the boy was tied-&#xD;
course he*as tied,-~i~ras Mr. Toadvix~e to risk his life&#xD;
he hands of a desperate and dangerous runaway, armed&#xD;
&#xD;
with a 'bowie';" an outlaw, burning with revenge' because&#xD;
he had'b~en properly punished,-~-was he to risk himself&#xD;
alone in the dark forests that lie between Ileechland and&#xD;
Heritage Place, with such a negro, except~ that negro&#xD;
were bound-witlz manacles andy chain, we should 8ay?&#xD;
But my client, frpni his urbane disposition, ki~idness of&#xD;
heart, and unusual bravery, was content with ~a single&#xD;
cord.&#xD;
"But two witnesses swear"~they saw a man going out&#xD;
of town, with a negro at his horse's heels, and a rope around&#xD;
his neck. Gentlemen, I do not wish to impugn the mo-&#xD;
tives ~of these witnesses, but I leave it to your imagina-&#xD;
tion to comprehend, how distinctly they could see *a' rope&#xD;
in the dusk of the evening; and also to decide~ if, because&#xD;
a man went out of' ]3eechland, as these witnesses testify,&#xD;
it must necessarily"have been my client, or the insubordi-&#xD;
nate and dangerous Jack.&#xD;
"The district attorney' has dwelt ~t 'length on the fa~t,&#xD;
that the law announces the punishment of murder for killing&#xD;
a ~uegro; he therefore argues that if the crime be proved,&#xD;
the law should be executed. Let me say, gentlemen, that&#xD;
these laws,. so inconsistent with our feelings andN our insti-&#xD;
tutions, are borrowed from the common .law of England;&#xD;
they ~were made for serfs, not 'independent, enlightened&#xD;
Southern men; and although they are legally living on our&#xD;
statute books; they ,are virtually dead; repealed by th9 su-&#xD;
periority of our enlightened public opinion, by custom, a&#xD;
by necessity.&#xD;
"Suppose, for a moment, that my client did kiU Jack,&#xD;

reason' such nonsense, 4hat it can, in one breath, make the&#xD;
same thing a chattel, a table, a wash-tub; and in the next&#xD;
respiration, declare it to be a feeling, reasoning, sensible&#xD;
being? If my supposition were true, and if the law were&#xD;
consistent, it would be your duty, gentle~nen, to bring in a&#xD;
verdict of damages~ ~Property alone has been destroyed.-.&#xD;
let reparation be made. This construction would be in&#xD;
accordance with equity, and in accordance with the spirit of&#xD;
our peculiar institutions. To forfeit the life of a white&#xD;
man, a sovereign citizen, f6t a miserable piece of property&#xD;
that is bought and sold, put up' at auction, bartered away,&#xD;
has no rights, is by law real estate-~is the sublime of ab-&#xD;
surdity, and makes men of sense pronounce a trial like this&#xD;
to be indeed a farce.&#xD;
"It is not true, gentlemen, that a law is a law, because&#xD;
it is up6n the statute book. The same law that in England&#xD;
is construed to mean murder in the flr~t degree, when&#xD;
brought~ before our enlightened courts, and our independ-&#xD;
ent juries, is translated to' be 'justifiable homicide.' In&#xD;
this country public opinion controls and governs the con-&#xD;
duct of all men, and we are forced to act in obedience to&#xD;
its potential voice, whatever law to the contrary may ex-&#xD;
ist. You will pardon me, gentlemen of the jury, for this&#xD;
digression, and coining back to the trial under considera-&#xD;
tion, I shall ende~wor to treat it with all 'due solemnity, and&#xD;
at least to go through the forms of a defence, however un-&#xD;
necessary it may be.&#xD;
'  My client did tie a rope around the boy Jack, and&#xD;
"4&#xD;
why? 'Because ~he was afraid, unless he had himin the most&#xD;
complete manner in his pow~r, he would slay him before&#xD;
'4&#xD;
&#xD;
he, Toadvine, reached his home. Can you not imagine,&#xD;
gentlemen, a thousand pays in which the negro 'could have&#xD;
been killed, while in this condition, by his own self-will,&#xD;
his own insubordination? Would it be an unnatural thing&#xD;
in negro history, to suppose that f~his 'amiable Jack' de-&#xD;
signedly held back, determined to die rather than return&#xD;
to the plantation? Can you. not imagine Mr. Toadvine's&#xD;
horse, which was young and fractious, suddenly taking&#xD;
alarm, and dragging the negro to the earth, when it was&#xD;
entirely beyond my client's power 'to anticipate such an&#xD;
accident; or control it wheli it occurred? But, gentlemen,&#xD;
this was not all,-death is not such a rare occurrence&#xD;
among negroes, that when one dies he must necessarily&#xD;
have been murdered. Mr. Orcutt clearly testifies that&#xD;
there was cholera among the prisoners, and could not Jack,&#xD;
with his bowie knife, have cut himself loose from tlie~ rope&#xD;
he was tied with, and by sudden exposure to the night&#xD;
air, after his previous comfortable lodgment in the jail,&#xD;
died upon* the road from the effects of this prostrating&#xD;
disease?&#xD;
"But, gentlemen, I perceive that IL am wasting your&#xD;
precious time by my unnecessary remarks, yet IL mu~4t,'~be-&#xD;
fore I close, allude to one extraorditiai~y appeal, made to&#xD;
you by the district attorney. Not content to take every ad-&#xD;
vantage of the technicalities of the law, to prejudice you&#xD;
against the prisoner, h~ ~has threatened you ~'with the in~'&#xD;
designation of "the fanatics of the North,' as 'a penalty~or&#xD;

&#xD;
goodpeQple of the North,' as my legal brother, jn a mo-&#xD;
ment of unguarded reflection, has called the 'abolition&#xD;
fanatjcs of the free States?' If they demand punishment&#xD;
upon my client, then you have a just cause for letting him go&#xD;
free; if he had killed a hundred negroes, our liberties, our&#xD;
religion, our all are in danger, the moment we make the&#xD;
least concession to the enemies of. our cherished institu~&#xD;
tions.&#xD;
"Gentlemen, I leave my client in your hands; you&#xD;
have the noble, the exalted, the majestic right, to unloose&#xD;
the hold of justice upon him; you can open his prison&#xD;
doors, and bid him go free. Restore him, gentlemen, to&#xD;
his exalted position in society as a citizen. Remember,&#xD;
that the blind goddess of Justice is looking down upon&#xD;
you, anxiously waiting to see you vindicate her purity,.-&#xD;
that the Angel of Liberty has her pen in hand, ready to&#xD;
inscribe upon the stars and stripes, that Toadvine and our&#xD;
country are free,-.--that the American eagle is standing&#xD;
upon the apex of the Rocky Mountains, with outstretched&#xD;
wings, one' eye bent upon this interesting scene, and the&#xD;
other, unblenched, staring at the noonday sun, ready in&#xD;
hi~ exalted flight to scream, 'Give me liberty, or give me&#xD;
death!"'&#xD;
Great and continuous cheering by the jury and audience&#xD;
now interrupted the major, who bowed repeatedly to&#xD;
his admirers,' and in a satisfied and oracular voice, he con-&#xD;
chided:,&#xD;
"Before you retire, gentlemen of the jury, the honored&#xD;
Court will give you the usual charge; you will hear the&#xD;
law expounded, sanctioned by the 'sacred ermine,' so long&#xD;
&#xD;
sanctified as the outward symbol of the unsullied purity&#xD;
of the law.-[Here the judge smoothed down his Arkansas&#xD;
blanket coat.]-Yonr verdict I already anticipate; confident&#xD;
of acquittal, I' leave my respected 4ient in your disposal."&#xD;
The moment that the applause called forth by Major&#xD;
Trimmer's eloquence had ceased, the sheriff vociferously&#xD;
called out order, order; and then taking a lounging negro&#xD;
by the shoulder, rudely thrust him out of doors, to show&#xD;
his vigilance in the public welfare; this being done, the&#xD;
"ermine" delivered itself as follows:&#xD;
"Gentlemen of the jury, you have heard the testimony&#xD;
on both sides of this case, and "-here the "ermine"&#xD;
yawned, and then went on: "if you think the prisoner&#xD;
guilty, you will bring in a verdict accordingly; if you. think&#xD;
him innocent, you will bring in a verdict accordingly!"&#xD;
the remainder of the "charge" became so indistinct, that the&#xD;
jurors, presumiflg that the "ermine" had concluded, headed&#xD;
by the sheriff, left their seats, and in a moment more could&#xD;
be heard, in shuffling sounds, overhead. /&#xD;
The moment the "twelve honest .men" were left to&#xD;
themselves, for deliberation, they proceeded at once to&#xD;
elect a "foreman," which being done, a general conversa-&#xD;
tion ensued, about crops, races, hard seats in the jury box,&#xD;
and Major Trimmer's speech. It was generally agreed&#xD;
that it was one of his tamest efforts, and thi~ waS ac-&#xD;
counted for by the fact, "that the trial being only about a&#xD;
nigger, didn't call forth his best style." A "piney woods'&#xD;
man" remarked, that he had shot a great many eagles,&#xD;
but he didn't see how one of them could look down and&#xD;

upward at the same time, but he s'posed Major Trimmer's&#xD;
bird "was cross-eyed."&#xD;
Buatt, who had been exceedingly restless throughout&#xD;
the~ whole trial, and had not hesitated to express it in every&#xD;
allowable way, now that he was in the jury-room, where&#xD;
he could speak, deliberately took off his overcoat, and&#xD;
folding it up for a pillow, stretched himself out upon a&#xD;
bench, remarking, "You know my sentiments,.~-I'm for&#xD;
hanging the jury, I don't care how your verdict is!" and in&#xD;
a few monwnts he fell into a profound slumber.&#xD;
The foreman i~aid there was no u~e of goiug down&#xD;
stairs immediately, that it would look better to a~pea~r\ to&#xD;
deliberate awhile, at least; and he started a very animated&#xD;
conversation about the coming election, in which the dif-&#xD;
ferent'meml5ers of the jury entered warmly, and freely ex-&#xD;
pressed their opinions of the "-prominent candidates."&#xD;
The sun had gone down, and as most of the jurors had&#xD;
become thirsty, it was decided to take down the verdict of&#xD;
"not guilty," which was agreed upon, without any formal&#xD;
consultation; but there was the stubborn ]3uatt, ready to&#xD;
differ with his eleven compeers, no matter how they de-&#xD;
cided, and who, if~not managed, might keep them ptis~n.&#xD;
ers, at the mercy of the judge.&#xD;
The foreman finally struck upon a bright, idea; he&#xD;
told all to say they were for "guilty," and then waking&#xD;
up Buatt, that worthy was informed that the jury had&#xD;
agreed." "How?" asked ]3uatt, still half asleep.&#xD;
"Guilty!" was the universal exclamation. "Well, I'm&#xD;
'not guilty,"' said Buatt, turning over to take another&#xD;
nap. The foreman then said, "Here, Buatt, put down&#xD;
&#xD;
your name to 'not guilty,' and let's go down and tell the&#xD;
judge we are hung." .Buatt readily consented, and signed&#xD;
his name to the verdict as requested, whereupon the fore-&#xD;
man suddenly exclaimed:&#xD;
"Gentlemen, thar's no use a-staying here all night,-..&#xD;
let's go over to Buatt's side, and get done with the busi-&#xD;
ness." The proposition was instantly agreed to, and a&#xD;
general laugh ensued at Buatt's expense. At first, he&#xD;
was quite indignant, but soon became reconciled.; and as&#xD;
the jury was going to report to the "ermine," he said,&#xD;
"If you hadn't played that trick on me, I intended to&#xD;
keep you tied up for three days; there's the bread and&#xD;
cheese I had to do it on," and he pointed to a large pack-&#xD;
age that protruded from his coat pocket.&#xD;
The moment the jury retired, 0-en. I3ledsoe was seen&#xD;
moving about on the outside of the court-house. He had&#xD;
private consultations with different persons; and as the&#xD;
sun disappeared; a number of armed men might have been&#xD;
seen stationed at different points,.-all appearing intent on&#xD;
some special object. Two were side by side, and as they&#xD;
examined their double-barrel fowling-pieces, one remarked,&#xD;
"There cannot be a doubt but that. the jury will bring in&#xD;
a verdict of not guilty, but we will teach him that there's&#xD;
law outside the courthouse, if there is none in it."&#xD;
The increasing darkness had settled upon the couii~-&#xD;
room,-the two or three candles that were burninTg only&#xD;
gave a sepulchral effect to the many spectators, who in&#xD;
silent groups remained to see the end, for it was rumored&#xD;
that Toadvine was "to be lynched," if let off by the jury.&#xD;
The prisoner maintained his place beside his counsel,&#xD;

still wearing that narked blanket coat; and he ocva~ion~&#xD;
ally looked out of doors with nervous apprehension. It&#xD;
was evidently from that quarter that he apprehended&#xD;
danger.&#xD;
Presently there was a movement of the jury overhead,&#xD;
and its members could be heard descending the stairs,&#xD;
which gave the usual signal that the jury had agreed&#xD;
upon a verdict. Every body commenced crowding rmnd&#xD;
the judge's stand, and universal confusion prevailed. The&#xD;
jury appeared, and after the usual preliminaries, each&#xD;
member answered "not guilty," as his name was called&#xD;
by the clerk. This done, "the ermine" complimented&#xD;
the jury on it~ attention, and the high-toned manner with&#xD;
whi9h it had conducted itself,..~-announced it "dis-&#xD;
charged;" and declared the prisoner free. Amid a great&#xD;
deal of confusion, a shout went up from the crowd; Gen.&#xD;
Bledsoe heard the offensive noi~e,-knew what it meant,&#xD;
and gnashed his teeth in anger "Now," said he, to some&#xD;
persons near him, "let us vindicate the outraged laws~"&#xD;
Every one now move4 but the late prisoner; there he eat,&#xD;
from his dress the most conspicuous person in the court-house,&#xD;
as if overcome with emotion; he stirred not, but burying&#xD;
his face, remained statue-like and still. Soon the self-con-&#xD;
stituted' a~~iters of the law, who were hovering outside in&#xD;
the darkness, became impatient for their prey, and some,&#xD;
unable longer to restrain their fury, amidst terrible oaths&#xD;
and imprecations, rushed into the court-room, to seize him&#xD;
where he sat when,~ lo and behold! instead of the sinis-&#xD;
ter face of Toadvine, there was revealed the honester one&#xD;
of ]?uckett!&#xD;

In the confusion of the, giving in of the verdict~ T~ad-&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
AN AMERICAN WEAKNESS.&#xD;
THE resignation of a member "elect" of the Legislature,&#xD;
caused an unexpected election P5 be held to supply the&#xD;
vacancy. t3ol. Lee, being a Virginian, and coming, as he&#xD;
often remarked, from the only State in the Union that&#xD;
made "politics a business;" of course took a deep in-&#xD;
terest in "public affairs;" and as he could not get from&#xD;
the people a nomination for himself, he determined, as a&#xD;
compliment, to his friend Mr. Moreton to obtain for that&#xD;
gentleman the distinguished honor.&#xD;
Mr. Moreton was highly respected, but was not in the&#xD;
popular sense a "favorite with the masses." He was&#xD;
eccentric in his humors, and, from long habit, accustomed&#xD;
to indulge in any caprice of feeling uppermost in his&#xD;
mind, consequently, he had the. reputation of being very&#xD;
proud; and, his occasionally amiable, and probably his&#xD;
natural manner, was regarded with suspicion by those who&#xD;
had become prejudiced by his frequent displays of insensi-&#xD;
bility and hauteur. But Mr~ Moreton was wealthy, and&#xD;
Lee 'had a Virginian theory, that every thing could be&#xD;
&#xD;
carried at the polls by a judicious use of money; and gfter&#xD;
some difficulty succeeded, to the surprise ~f every body&#xD;
but those in the ~eeret, to have Mr. Moreton declared the&#xD;
choice of ~' the party 1"&#xD;
It required all ()ol. Lee's eloquence to induce Mr.&#xD;
Moreton to become a candidate; but his pride and his&#xD;
ambition were wrought upon, and with the understanding&#xD;
that Mr. Moreton's friends were to do all the electioneer-&#xD;
ing, the selected candidate was declared "duly in the&#xD;
field." On the Saturday succeeding these events, Mr.&#xD;
Moreton's name appeared in large type in the columns of&#xD;
the Southern Clarion, with a highly laudatory editorial&#xD;
notice.&#xD;
The eketion was to be what was called a "short brush,'~'&#xD;
and the "~Moreton party" entered at once upon their ar-&#xD;
duous duties. Busted, 'and his hangers-on, immediately&#xD;
rose into popularity. Loafers, who had not been known&#xD;
to have a cent for months, were in the streets spending&#xD;
money, and "working" for Moreton; and~ one or two&#xD;
"awful republicans," who had made it their business for&#xD;
years to denounce Moreton "as a stuck-up aristocrat,&#xD;
who hated poor men, and tried to run over them, because&#xD;
he owned a hundred niggers~" suddenly became convinced&#xD;
that they were mistaken; and they felt it a matter of sini-&#xD;
pie justice, and in "liGnor bound," to give Mr. Moreton&#xD;
their cordial support.&#xD;
Now the "representative district" had an extraordi-&#xD;
nary geographical peculiarity~ It was a long narrow belt&#xD;
of la~id, bounded in front by the Mississippi,-in the rear,&#xD;
by a "dry river." The lands fronting upon th~ "Father&#xD;
&#xD;
3M&#xD;

~28             THE MASTER'S notxsn;                                             A T4LR OP SOTYT1D~UN LIFE.         329&#xD;
&#xD;
of waters" were rich and ~fertile beyond comparison, and&#xD;
were taken up by large plantations, and possessed of&#xD;
course but few white inhabitants, the 'population being&#xD;
mostly negroes. The lands shelving toward "dry river"&#xD;
were 'piny woods," arid densely~occupied by poor white&#xD;
men, who, owning but few serVants, were obliged to work&#xD;
themselves.&#xD;
The "opposition," therefore, conceived the idea, that&#xD;
as the defeat of Mr. Moreton under the circumstances was&#xD;
almost hopeless, (there not being time to bring the proper&#xD;
influences to bear,) the best thing that could be done was&#xD;
to bring out a "Green River candidate;" set him going&#xD;
with the cry of "the poor man's friend," and the "piny&#xD;
woods pony," and let him "rip," as some of the boys&#xD;
said, who liked the fun of the contest, without caring for&#xD;
the result.&#xD;
To carry~ out this design, a man living in "Possum&#xD;
]I6llow," by the name of Puffy White, who was the father&#xD;
of a large family, miserably poor and ignorant, but self-&#xD;
conceited, and who from the habit of using large words with-&#xD;
out knowing the meaning of them, was considered a great&#xD;
man in his region of country,-was declared an "inde-&#xD;
pendent candidate," who would run without regard to&#xD;
cliques, "ohiekenry," or mercenary influences. This de-&#xD;
cided upon, Puffy White's name was sent to the Southern&#xD;
Clarion for publication, which caused the editor much&#xD;
embarrassment.&#xD;
The difficulty lay in this: if the editor of the&#xD;
logal paper had any sentiment whatt~ver, it was to, hate&#xD;

&#xD;
self~to elevate them, and sustain their sway in the commu-&#xD;
nity, still it was a heartless support, and bought for a&#xD;
price. Lee had delicately sent to him a note, inclosing a&#xD;
fifty dollar bill, in which'he stated, that he did not expect&#xD;
him '(the editor) to occupy his coknins, in support of can-&#xD;
didates for political honors, and give his labor without just&#xD;
remuneration.&#xD;
On the other hand, Puffy White had his sympathy&#xD;
simply because he was Puffy White, and also 'because a&#xD;
leading member elect of the Legislature, and a friend of&#xD;
the candidate for the United States Senate, bad of course&#xD;
sent the editor a letter, in which he spoke in very compli-&#xD;
mentary terms of the Southern Clarion, and suggested&#xD;
that it might get the State printing, if Duffy White could&#xD;
be elected: Mr. Moreton was known to be friendly to a&#xD;
journal printed in another part of the State. The editor&#xD;
of the Clarion finally pursued his usual course when&#xD;
deeply puzzled; he went over to the~" head-quarters,"&#xD;
and took several successive "drinks," and after getting&#xD;
his ideas sufficiently conglomerated to write himself out 'of&#xD;
the difficulty, he dashed off the following notice, and&#xD;
placed it in his most valuable columns.&#xD;
"In our last issue, we .noticed the 'regular nomina-&#xD;
tion' of Peyton Moreton, Esq., as candidate for the vacant&#xD;
seat in the "Legislature. At. that time we were not aware&#xD;
that Mr. Moreton would have an opposing candidate. It&#xD;
will be seen, by reference to the proper column, that&#xD;
Capt. Puffy White has consented 'to allow his name to be&#xD;
used; and we understand that he has' many warm frieu4s&#xD;
and admirers. As an independent journalist, it is best,&#xD;

~uU             TIlE MASTER'S HOUSE;&#xD;
*&#xD;
Perhaps, that we take no part in this contest; both gentle.&#xD;
men are personally known and honored in our midst ; and&#xD;
either, if elected, will serve his constituents with credit,&#xD;
and worthily represent the State." This editorial i~as read&#xD;
and laughed at; Mr. Moreton never dreamed of any serious&#xD;
opposition, and in anticipation of his election, took to&#xD;
studying with the greatest avidity "Jefferson's Manual,"&#xD;
and arranging his ideas on the subject of the "New Con-&#xD;
stitution."&#xD;
A few days only, however, had passed away before the&#xD;
scales began to fall from their eyes. A United States&#xD;
Senator was to be elected) and the candidate for that&#xD;
office knew that he could receive no support from Mr.&#xD;
Moreton, for they not only differed in politics, but were&#xD;
not personally friendly; but having plenty of money, and&#xD;
determined, if possible, to be elected, he sent the "right&#xD;
kind of a man from the State Capitol" over to "Possum&#xD;
Hollow" to see Puffy White, to furnish him with the*&#xD;
sinews of war,"-~-get his tickets printed,-supply his~&#xD;
electors with whiskey, and slang terms; and before Col.&#xD;
Lee was aware of it, Puffy Whitp's party came out "of&#xD;
the woods," like an army "terrible with banners."&#xD;
A clap of thux~der at noonday could not have been&#xD;
more unexpected to the people of Beechland. The excite-&#xD;
ment was~ immense. Some of the "independent voters,"&#xD;
whom' Lee had apparently secure&amp;amp; to himself by a shake of&#xD;
the hand, or the loamof a few dollars, began. to stagger in&#xD;
their fealty, and the" sturdy republicans," who had been so&#xD;
suddenly convinced that Mr. Moreton was not so proud a&#xD;
man as they thought him, went over to Duffy White's&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
side, body and soul; acknowledging privately, that they&#xD;
had been for the moment influenced by improper motives.&#xD;
The shock to Mr. Moretwi was overwhelming. He&#xD;
had, against his wishes, been induced to run,---never&#xD;
dreaming of opposition; or, if defeated) prestimed that it&#xD;
would be by some opponent wQrthy of his steel, and the&#xD;
possibility of Puffy White's being preferred to him by his&#xD;
fellow~citizens as a representative, stung him t~ the qnick;&#xD;
roused all his energy and all his bitterness; and by&#xD;
the advice of Lee, he got out an old carriage, with a&#xD;
couple of plough-horses attached, and putting on home-&#xD;
spun clothes, and his overseer's hat, he started out seri-&#xD;
ously to electioneer,-giving his confidential lieutenants&#xD;
to understand, that any reasonable, or unreasonable,&#xD;
amount of money was at their command to keep him from&#xD;
being disgraced. The season of the year was fine; the&#xD;
people had their "crops laid by," and the unexpected&#xD;
excitement of the election was a-~source1 of gratificatioi~i to&#xD;
all,~for to people who had little or nothing to do, it gave&#xD;
pleasant employment to body and mind.&#xD;
Ten days more, and the result would be known.&#xD;
Puffy White, it was evident, had secured the entire sym-&#xD;
pathy of his neighborhood constituents~ Hardly &amp;amp;inan in&#xD;
tke "piny woods" but felt that he was bound to sustain a&#xD;
candidate, brought out in compliment to "the toiling~mil-&#xD;

community a sort of fascination, and Puffy White-'-who&#xD;
made a mark to represent his xiame-who was even igno-&#xD;

tongue, ~was likely to be elected to the responsible office of&#xD;
maker and conservator of the laws.&#xD;
So indefatigable had been the canvassers on both&#xD;
sides, that th~ friends of the two candidates had procured&#xD;
the names of voters in the sparse population of the&#xD;
county, and it could be told with almost unerring cer-&#xD;
tainty how would stand the ballot. The consequence was,&#xD;
that Mr. Moreton's friends discovered that a few votes&#xD;
might decide the result; and then rose into-sudden notice&#xD;
a "genteel gambler," by the name of Hickman, who could&#xD;
by his influence on certainof Busteed's customers, control&#xD;
some eight or ten of the "independent co~nstituency."&#xD;
No sooner had Col. Lee informed himself ~of the fact, than&#xD;
he immediately saw that it was necessary to secure Hick-&#xD;
man to Mr. Moreton's interest; and he accordingly set&#xD;
about the task.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Mr. Moreton, who was of the most excita-&#xD;
ble temperament, was wrought up to the highest pitch of&#xD;
disquietude. He Wanted the thing decided, and to be out&#xD;
of his agony. fluffy White bestrode him night and day.&#xD;
He bcca~xie disgusted with the concessions of opinion he&#xD;
had. to make to people he despised,-of affected sympathy&#xD;
for people he ~air1y hatcd,.-yet he was kept in this ter-&#xD;
ribk slavery,' because it was necessary for him to defeat&#xD;
fluffy White.&#xD;
"Th.-n Duffy White!" he would roar out, when by&#xD;
himself in 'the woods; "4-n Thiffy White!" he would&#xD;
exclaim in' the sacred precincts of his own fii'eside.&#xD;
Mrs. Nioreton never interfered with her husband's&#xD;
:plans, except to give them her cordial endorsement; but&#xD;
&#xD;
she became, absolutely alarmed at Mr. Moreton's intense&#xD;
feeling, and for the - first time in the - many years of her&#xD;
married life,-'-made a' suggestion.&#xD;
She urged Mr. Moreton to treat this ho1~rid fluify&#xD;
White as he deservad-.-" treat him," said she; "with&#xD;
sovereign contempt; and, by resigning, put it out' of the&#xD;
power of vulgar people to affect your happiness, or for one&#xD;
moment destroy your peace." But Mr. Moreton had&#xD;
become infected with~ the idea of otlice,.-to be a member&#xD;
of the 'Legislature,-a position he had always ridiculed&#xD;
and scoffed at, suddenly became important for hi~ welfare,&#xD;
and writhing, as he was, in the mud and mire of -political.&#xD;
chicanery, he allowed himself to be 'hurried on~&#xD;
Hickman was a sensitive person, and loved popularity;&#xD;
and finding himself cut off by his "professional pursuits'?&#xD;
from such society as h&amp;amp;mopt admired, he took pleasure in&#xD;
courting the good will of that class of idlers whd hang&#xD;
about barrooms, in every decaying town; and as he seem--&#xD;
ingly gave much, and demanded little in return, ~he thus&#xD;
found himself unexpectedly. honored with the disposition&#xD;
of a certain number of his admirers' votes. It had always&#xD;
been Hickman's darling ambition to become acquainted&#xD;
with Col. Lee; and .when that gentleman, after passing him&#xD;
by in 'silent contempt for years,' met him, and shook him&#xD;
by the hand, and expressed a great interest in his 'welfare&#xD;
and happiness, Hickman was shrewd enough to under-&#xD;
stand the cause of his sudden popularity, and. at once&#xD;
determined to 'make the best possible use of it foi' his oWn&#xD;
advantages        -          -&#xD;

&#xD;
*in some way mortally offended him; and as he, Hickman,&#xD;
possessed a mean spirit, and waited to win the reputation&#xD;
of a "fighting man," he came to the . singular determi-&#xD;
nation that it would be a source of great glory to chal-&#xD;
lenge Mildmay,~ and tifas, without running any danger,&#xD;
receive the consideration so universally (as he supposed)&#xD;
bestowed upon a professed duellistt.&#xD;
Hickman had often overheard Col. Lee speak. in no&#xD;
respectful terms of what he called Mr. ~i~dmay's cour-&#xD;
age; it had become a kind of prevalent idea that Mildmay&#xD;
was prmei~pled against duelling. But, since the trial,&#xD;
Mildmay'~ strict attention to business,.-his bye of books,&#xD;
his conscientious discharge of every duty as a citizen,-.&#xD;
his interference on one or two occasions as a peacemaker&#xD;
between parties who had difficulties,--his intense desire to&#xD;
leave Toadvine to be punished by the written law, rather&#xD;
than by violence,.-.--his condemnation, by example, of in-&#xD;
temporance,-all these things' had gradually caused him&#xD;
to be looked upon as one "destitute of spirit," as "lack-&#xD;
ing chivalry;" and he became in popular estimation a rieh&#xD;
but utterly ruined man, from the force of an unfortunate&#xD;
"Northern education."&#xD;
With the determination on the part of Hickman t~&#xD;
make the most out of his sudden acquaintance with Mr.&#xD;
More~on, he met CoL Lee's advances with coldness ~ 'and&#xD;
it was not until he had been out to Mr. Moreton's house,&#xD;
that he allowed 'hbnself to be formally approached with&#xD;
regard to the coming political 'struggle. After a sump-&#xD;
tuous dinner, and the use' of much wine, the subject of&#xD;
the election was flatly broached, and the proud and digni-&#xD;
&#xD;
fled Mr. Moreton, in the excitement of the moment, conde-&#xD;
scended to ask Hickman' for his support.&#xD;
But Hickman had determined to have his pound of&#xD;
flesh. It was. a pleasure to him to see those begging and&#xD;
sujng for his influence who had so long and so lately&#xD;
passed him~~unheeded by; and after enjoying this triumph&#xD;
to his heart's content, he coldly 'told Mr. :Moreton of his&#xD;
feelings toward Mildmay,-.dwelt upon the supposed in-&#xD;
suIts he had received from that young xnan,.-.and de-&#xD;
manded, as the only price that could be paid~for his votes,&#xD;
that Mr. Moreton would the next~ day take fro~i. him,&#xD;
hickman, a challenge to the owne1~ of Heritage Place.&#xD;
Although of late there had sprung .up between Mr.&#xD;
Moreton and Mildmay, some coolness, yet had Hickman&#xD;
proposed to Mr. ~Moreton si~ch a thing~ as being his second&#xD;
on the day before his nomination for office, Mr. Moreton&#xD;
would probably have chastised Hickman on the spot, but&#xD;
on the present occasion, his astonishment at the. imperti-&#xD;
nence of Hickman, and ~his. fear for the moment to offend&#xD;
him, kept him silent; and for the first time in his life, he&#xD;
felt humbled in his own imperial heart.&#xD;
Hickman bore the suspense of Mr. Moreton's indeci-&#xD;
sion with the same blank look that he would have assumed,&#xD;
had he staked his all on the turning of a~card, and in this&#xD;
his professional pursuits had given him a manner that was&#xD;
now of service.&#xD;
"I'll think of this!" said Mr. Moreton, finally moving&#xD;
away. "I'll think of this!" he repeated, and turning to&#xD;
Hickman, he continued: "Col. Lee will give you my an-&#xD;
Swer in the morning."'&#xD;

"Master ! 'U, said the servant, presenting herself with a&#xD;
silver salver, containing some minute but fragrant cups of&#xD;
coffee and Havana cigars.-." Master, the gentleman has&#xD;
gone 'without his coffee."&#xD;
Mr. Moreton was pacing hurriedly up and down the&#xD;
gallery; he was very fond of coffee, and for the first time&#xD;
in years, when in health, he waved it away, and continued&#xD;
his agitated strides. Lee, however, helped himself, and&#xD;
after slowly drinking the de1iciou~ beverage, he took np a&#xD;
cigar, and telling the girl to bring him a light, sat com-&#xD;
posedly down. In 2a few moments the smoke was"cuiiing&#xD;
~r~und his ,head. Mean~vhile Mr. Moreton passed and re-&#xD;
passed before him, resembling, in his agitation, and in the&#xD;
mechanical certainty of his steps, a lion exercising in his&#xD;
cage.&#xD;
"Lee! '~. said Mr. Moreton~ finally.-" Lee! by heaven,&#xD;
sir, this is insufferable! I'm badgered by thai~ scoundrel,&#xD;
DuI~y White, and bearded in my own den, by ~ miserable&#xD;
blackleg, that should be hung up to the first tree."&#xD;
"It's bad, Moreton!" returned Le~ in an affected&#xD;
voice; "but it's nothing after alL Take' the challenge,"&#xD;
he continued; "Hickman is an arrant~ coward, aiA Mild-&#xD;
may 'is too psalm-singing, and too much of a gentleman, to~&#xD;
accept it; we'll keep the thing on the tapis until after, the&#xD;
election, get Hickman's votes, and then let him go to the&#xD;
or what is just the same, make him and Mildmay&#xD;
shake hri~nds, and ~ay no more about the matter."&#xD;
'&amp;amp; [C I thought," replied Mr. Moreton, ~checking his&#xD;
strides, "if I thoughtil should in any way, by this matter,&#xD;
compromise myself; if I thought Mildmay would look upon&#xD;
&#xD;
my conduct as I do, I'd stop here, and vote for fluffy&#xD;
White myself, before I would secure my seat by such&#xD;
means."&#xD;
"But Mildmay won't thiiik about it as you do!" said&#xD;
Col. Lee. "He will receive the challenge, ask to have an&#xD;
explanation made to Hickman (for Mildmay has never in.&#xD;
tentionally offended him), and you will 'make Mildmay feel&#xD;
obliged for acting in the matter, and if Hickman ever says&#xD;
any thing offensive, I will;~ myself, chastise' his imperti-&#xD;
nence."&#xD;
"I'll have nothing to do with it," said Mr. Moreton, after&#xD;
a long hesitation-" nothing to do with it. I am ashamed,"&#xD;
he continued, "'that I consented to run for an office which&#xD;
cannot be obtained without so many sacrifices~ I abandon&#xD;
the contest, and leave the arena of politics until gentlemen&#xD;
can appear upon it, and be respected."&#xD;
CoL Lee knew the disposition of Mr. Moreton too well&#xD;
to argue with him after he had come. toi~a determination;&#xD;
he therefore rose to depart, when, just at the moment, there&#xD;
appeared at the gate the well-known Col. Price. The&#xD;
overseer was a "piney woods man," and was 'much relied&#xD;
upon by Mr. Moreton, for his influence with that class of&#xD;
people; the consepxence was, that ever since the contest&#xD;
bogan, the ~overseer, on the pretence of attending to politi-&#xD;
cal interests, had neglected the more important ones of the&#xD;
plantation; and he had just returned from' Beechland, with&#xD;
the latest news,&#xD;
Out of breath, a little intoxicated, and mnch excited;&#xD;

Moreton. He related, among other things, that there h~td&#xD;
been "an extra" printed and circulated, that represented&#xD;
'Mr. Moreton as a man that Wouldn't let his overseers, or&#xD;
any other poor men, come into his presence, unless they&#xD;
held their hats in their hands, and behaved like niggers;&#xD;
that he would not allow Nsaid poor men, particulady "if&#xD;

but rudely dro~ them away from his house, or if particu-&#xD;
larly kind, would send them to the negro quarters, to get&#xD;
~omethiug to eat! It was, furthermore asserted, that he&#xD;
had started on an electioneering tour, with a suit of clothes&#xD;
on he had' borrowed from his overseer; that he had a' sil-&#xD;

In conclusion,. CoL Price (who had really gone out frol-&#xD;

Hickman gained,-triumph was sure. 1~Xoreton hesitated,&#xD;
argued, took a favorable view of the challenge, began to&#xD;
think it was nothing serious after all, a ~ner~ whim of&#xD;
Hickman's,-that Mildmay would forget it in a few days-.&#xD;
that any thing unpleasant could be. rec6n~iled at the dinner&#xD;
which Mr. Moreton proposed to give, to celebrate his elec-&#xD;
tion; ~nd the end was, that Lee kft for Beechland, with&#xD;
the understanding that he would prepare a respectful chal-&#xD;
lenge for Hickman, get that gentleman's name signed to it,&#xD;
bring it out the next day to Nir. Moreton, who would de-&#xD;
liver it to. Nijldmay, and leave it take its cour~e.&#xD;
Mildmay was so busy attending to his planting inter-&#xD;
ests, that lie had only heard byaccident, that there was to N&#xD;
be an eleA~tion and that Mr. Moreton was the candidate.&#xD;
It was his intention therefore, at a stated, time, to ride over&#xD;
with Annie to Mr. Moreton's house, and talk'with him on&#xD;
the subject; he was,. therefore, not surprised the next&#xD;
day, when he saw Mr. Moreton coming toward Heritage&#xD;
Place, and supposing the gentlemaff was upon the buss ~&#xD;
of the canvass, Mildmay met him at the gate, and w§ ~&#xD;
welcomed him into the hquse.&#xD;
The more Mildinay \talked, the more moody became&#xD;
Mr. Moreton; the interview soon settled down chilly and&#xD;
ceremonious; at length Mr. Moreton, with evident embar-&#xD;

neatly elopedd note, handed it toMr. ~iildmay.&#xD;

as if. to assure himself that that gentIei~ian was the bearer&#xD;
of such a message; having, confirmed himself in all these&#xD;
particulars, he folded up the note, quietly placed it in its&#xD;
envelope, and said:&#xD;
"Mr. Moreton, I must confess my surprise at receiving&#xD;
a message of this kind, particularly as it is from a man,&#xD;
whom I ~have 'no very certain knowledge that I have ever&#xD;
seen. The fact that you have, deemed it importMit enough&#xD;
to bring it, makes it necessary that I should treat it with&#xD;
due reflection; if I return yqu an answer on next Monday,&#xD;
will it be with your sanction, and so far as the time is con-&#xD;
cerned, satisfactory ?"&#xD;
Mildmay's voice\and manner relieved Mr. Moreton, for&#xD;
every moment he was losing his self-control, aild sinking in&#xD;
his own estimation, for consenting to bear the message at&#xD;
all. He therefore eagerly caught at the future time men-&#xD;
tioned for the receipt of the answer, and remarked:&#xD;
"' That will be soon enough, Mr. Mildmay, and perhaps&#xD;
th~dest time, as I am this week exceedingly busy with un-&#xD;
*     You shall hear from me then," said Mildmay quietly,&#xD;
for he deter~nined, from the moment, that he comprehended&#xD;
the nature of the note, not to speak an unnecessary word.&#xD;
In a few moments more, Mr. Moreton, after declining any&#xD;
refre . t, mounted his horse, and rode away.&#xD;
.Mild~ay, after. due reflection upon the challe~ige, do-&#xD;
cided that he would not alarm Annie by mentioning the&#xD;
subject to her; an~X that he would write an informal ~iote&#xD;
to Mr. Moreton, refusing to accept the challenge, or have&#xD;
any thing to do with Mr. Hickman, whose character&#xD;
&#xD;
and positiOn he had become accidentally acquainted with,&#xD;
through some casual remarks of hi~ neighbor, Mr. Steers.&#xD;
He therefore prepared his ansWer, determined to take&#xD;
advantage of the first opportunity to send it, by a suitable&#xD;
person, to Mr. Moreton; and thus the matter rested.&#xD;
The day of the election was also the day for sendi~ig&#xD;
the reply, and on the morning of that important event,&#xD;
Mildmay noticed Mr. Moreton's eldest son approaching his&#xD;
house, and on inquiry, found -that the lad was going some.&#xD;
distance, to attend a ~cprecinct,~~ a few -miles off, where&#xD;
he would remain all day, and. bring- home the returns of&#xD;
the "poll" .to his father, in the evening. Mildmay cow&#xD;
granulated himself upon having such an excellent person&#xD;
tc~ take his rather delicate epistle, and gave it to - young&#xD;
Master Moreton, with the request that he would deliver it&#xD;
as directed, on his return at night,-'-.the lad promised to&#xD;
do so, and continued his journey on the road.&#xD;
It was agreed by Squire Hobby, Busteed, and the "old-&#xD;
est inhabitant," that there never had been such an ex-&#xD;
citement at B.eechland, as there was at the present occa~&#xD;

friends, and some bad liquor, "barbecued beef," and -sea&#xD;
biscuit "for the masses," who were Mr. Moreton'~s~ friends.&#xD;
Of this last named "lunch," as there were ~no other rem,&#xD;

in high spirits, and now entirely confident of success.&#xD;
The fact, however, that Mr. Moreton had condescended&#xD;
to take a challenge from Hickman to Mildmay, was much&#xD;
speculated upon by many quiet, thinking people, who were&#xD;
in their hearts opposed to duelling; and as they had an&#xD;
opportunity of expressing their indignation through the&#xD;
ballot-box, without incurring any responsibility, Mr. More-&#xD;
ton was therefore quietly deprived of about four votes for&#xD;
every one gained by Hickman's influence, that, under&#xD;
other circumstances, would have been his. The conse-&#xD;
quence was, that when the poll was made up, much to the&#xD;
astonishment of all parties, it was found, "that Mr. More-&#xD;
ton had run ahead of his ticket" every where but at&#xD;
]Jeecl,]and.&#xD;
It would be impossible 'to describe the overwhelming&#xD;
confusion that seized upon Mr. Moreton, when he learned&#xD;
his defeat; he stalked up and~down his gallery a perfectly&#xD;
wretched man. He did not, or would not, comprehend&#xD;
the real causes of this disaster, but in accordance with his&#xD;
whole life of neglect of self-control, which had compara-&#xD;
tively ruined the usefulness of his otherwise splendid&#xD;
mind, he seemed to be desirous of finding some object on&#xD;
which to vent, his spleen, amid which he remembered the&#xD;
note he had received from Mildmay by the hand of his&#xD;
&#xD;
son, but which had heretofore been unread, in the crowding&#xD;
excitements of the hour.&#xD;
While engaged in reading the first line in the frank&#xD;
and manly epistle of Miildmay, Col. Lee presented him.&#xD;
self. He had come out to Mr. Moreton's to console his&#xD;
friend, and explain away the unhappy effects of the elec-&#xD;
tion catastrophe. He was received with marked cool-&#xD;
ness; there was a glimmering in Mr. M5eton's mind that&#xD;
the colonel was the cause of his unpleasant position,&#xD;
and Lee had an idea that such wa~ the case himself. It&#xD;
was, therefore, that that gentleman sat quietly down, de-&#xD;
pending upon his address, and events as they presented&#xD;
themselves, to make his peace with the ~'defeated candi-&#xD;
date."&#xD;
Mr. Moreton, without particularly excusing himself,&#xD;
after he saw that Lee was seated, resuiaed the reading of&#xD;
Mildmay's note. Could Mr. iMioreton have received it&#xD;
under other circumstances,-could his naturally sound&#xD;
judgment have operated a moment upon his mind, he&#xD;
would' have sent for Mildmay, and in his natural, if ex-&#xD;
pressed, enthusiasm,, hugged him to his heart as a friend&#xD;
and younger brother,-so cordial, so frank, so manly, was&#xD;
Mildmay's letter: but such was not to be the case. 'After&#xD;
reading the epistle more than once, and after having sev-&#xD;
eral times determined to send for Mildmay, and himself&#xD;
make, au explanation of his conduct so far as Hickman&#xD;
was co~ned,-hi5 pride would revolt at making any&#xD;
concessiQa; he was afraid that Col. Lee would not ap-&#xD;
prove of such a course; he remembered how Mildmay had&#xD;
disagreed with him in their last conversation, and without&#xD;

&#xD;
being conscious of it, himself, he had adopted the prevaiI~&#xD;
ing idea, that Mildinay "wouldn't fight:" so, amid! all&#xD;
these conflicting emotions, he turr~d to Gol. Lee, and said,&#xD;
"Mildmay refuses to ui9et Hickman."&#xD;
This remark was a relief to the colonel; lie at once&#xD;
comprehended, that by making the proposed duel the sub-&#xD;
ject of conversation, he could lead Mr. Moreton off from&#xD;
an unpleasant subject,.-break the force of the first disap-&#xD;
pointment, and prepare the way to have it consigned to&#xD;
forgetfulness., The colonel therefore said: "I hope, Mr.&#xD;
Moreton, that Mr. Mildmay has not had the effrontery1 in&#xD;
refusing to accept Hickman's challenge, to put it upon the&#xD;
ground that Mr. Hickman is not a gentleman?"&#xD;
"1 didn't notice whether he did or no," returned Mr.&#xD;
Moreton, perusing the note again, and then handing it to&#xD;
Col. Lee, who also read it attentively.&#xD;
Col. .Lee, still desirous of leading Mr. Moreton away&#xD;
from thinking of the. election, finally said, "I think Mr.&#xD;
Mildmay does insinuate that Mr. Hickman is not a gentle-&#xD;
man; at all events, he clearly says that he received the chal-&#xD;
lenge with' surprise, considering the source from whence it&#xD;
emanated."&#xD;
Mr. Moreton's face flushed with conflicting emotions,&#xD;
and walking up and 'down the gallery a few times, he said,&#xD;
with some excitement, "I hope that I have not fallen so&#xD;
low, that a person for whom I act as a friend, can be&#xD;
treated with contempt."&#xD;
"I don't think Hickman deserves to be quarrelled&#xD;
about," said Lee, with indifference; "he is good enough&#xD;
for gentlemen to use when necessary, but nothing more."&#xD;
&#xD;
"At the same time, Lee," said Mr. Moreton, for the first&#xD;
time fully comprehending his position toward Hickman,&#xD;
"if a gentleman agrees to take a challenge, the circum-&#xD;
stances become very peculiar, where the second leaves a&#xD;
positive affront on the principal, to go unnoticed?'.&#xD;
"That's true," said Col. Lee, in an authoritative&#xD;
tone, the idea suddenly flashing upon him, that if Moreton&#xD;
challenged Mildmay, he would of course have the arrange-&#xD;
ment of the preliminaries, which were much more elegant&#xD;
and aristocratic than elections; and also remembering that&#xD;
Mildmay " wouldn't fight," he concluded, to play' upon&#xD;
Mr. Moreton's high sense of honor, so as to get that gen-&#xD;
tleman to take Hickman's place; and so well did he succeed,&#xD;
that when he left for Beechland late at night, Mr. More-&#xD;
ton's disappointment at the result of the election was en-&#xD;
tirely swallowed up by more vindictive feelings; and Lee,&#xD;
in his lonely homeward ride, rehearsed to himself the ex-&#xD;
citing preliminaries of a "personal meeting," in which&#xD;
he was to be the leading second, thereby acquiring for&#xD;
himself additional social and personal glory.&#xD;

CHAPTflR xxviii.&#xD;
THE FIELD OF HONOR.&#xD;
WREN Col. Lee rode over to Heritage Place with "the&#xD;
note," from Mr. Moreton, Mildmay accidentally met him&#xD;
in the road, near the house; and the colonel internally con-&#xD;
gratulated himself upon the fact, as he did not care to be&#xD;
embarrassed in his errand, by the appearance of Mrs.&#xD;
Mildmay. After a few general remarks, the colonel pre-&#xD;
sented the missive.&#xD;
Mildmay, in his letter to Mr. Moreton, had assumed&#xD;
the tone of one who had alright to speak, as to a friend;&#xD;
he clearly expressed the obligations he was under to Mr.&#xD;
Moreton, from the first evening he landed at Heritage&#xD;
Place, up to the moment of his writing. He assumed that&#xD;
as the challenge from Hickman was evidently instigated&#xD;
by malice, that Mr. Moreton would see the person inte-&#xD;
rested, ~nd by a few words, put an end to the matter~&#xD;
Yet he was not altogether, in his own communing, pas-&#xD;
sive under the infliction. With his usual~ good sense, he&#xD;
made all allowance for Mr. Moreton's presumed education&#xD;
&#xD;
in favor of the "code of honor," and yet he felt deeply&#xD;
touched, that that gentleman would condescend to make a&#xD;
felloW like Hickman, so much an equal, as to act as his se-&#xD;
cond; and after revolving the matter in his mind, he came&#xD;
to the conclusion, that it evinced, on the part of Mr.&#xD;
Noreton, a want of that proper appreciation for himself,&#xD;
that he felt he was entitled to, and there was, consequent-&#xD;
ly, a blow struck to his self-esteem, which he deeply felt.&#xD;
When, therefore, he read the challenge borne by Col.&#xD;
Lee, he felt the blood rushing to his head, and then came&#xD;
over him the defiant spirit of an injured man at bay. Re-&#xD;
membering that he had already appealed to Mr. Moreton's&#xD;
friendship in vain, the truth flashed upon him, that he was&#xD;
surrounded with toils, that would require, to escape from&#xD;
with self-respect, the most consummate address ; Khe, there-&#xD;
fore, after a few moments' hesitation, informed Col. Lee,&#xD;
that at the earliest possible moment, through the hands of&#xD;
a friend, he would be honored with an answer, whereupon&#xD;
the two gentlemen courteously bade each other adieu, and&#xD;
separated.&#xD;
Mildmay rode toward his home, with a struggle in&#xD;
his mind that gave him the first intense misery he had&#xD;
ever felt in his life. By a train of circumstances over&#xD;
which he had no control, and by the connivance of persons&#xD;
the least expected, he found himself in one of the most&#xD;
difficult positions in which a man of feeling and high sense&#xD;
of self-respect could be placed. He had always denounced&#xD;
duelling; his early teachings, and his own religious senti-&#xD;
ments, condemned the practice; yet, as he rode along, his&#xD;
ears would burn, and his face flush, at the thought of hay-&#xD;

&#xD;
ing Col. Lee, Mr. Moreton, and "the world!" apply to&#xD;
him~an opprobrious epithet.&#xD;
Mildmay u~as in the garden of temptationr.-.the bitter&#xD;
cup was ,at his lips; his moral principles were now to be&#xD;
tested: how ignorant was he up to that moment of his&#xD;
real nature. Mr. Moreton would have made friends with&#xD;
Mildmay; his calm judgment and better feelings dictated&#xD;
that' he should, but lie was so brave, that he was afraid of&#xD;
Col. Lee's censure. Mildmay cared as little for the good&#xD;
or bad opinion of the people in and about Beecliland, as&#xD;
perfectly independent circumstances, superior education,&#xD;
and want of sympathy, could make one; yet, strange as it&#xD;
may seem, he cowered under the idea of having these&#xD;
same people, for whom he really felt so little respect, con-&#xD;
d~nin him, ~for doing what he knew tobe right,-to be&#xD;
just,--to be Christian~-refuse to take part in a duel; he~&#xD;
therefQre wavered, and finally placed his peace of mind,&#xD;
and his life;' out of his~ keeping,...-s~.irrendered to a bloody&#xD;
Moloch, the noble attribute of self-apprecience, and for&#xD;
the time, trembled more from the fear of corrupt man,&#xD;
than he did at the just anger of his God.&#xD;
After a long and most painful conversation with Gen.&#xD;
Illedsoe, Nflldmay, as he was about retiring, remarked, "See&#xD;
Mr. Moreton, do every thing proper to have this matter,&#xD;
as it should be, amicably arranged; if it cannot be, I leave&#xD;
all future arrangements in your hands."&#xD;
Neyer did a more genial day dawn upon the luxuriant&#xD;
fields of the south than was ushered in on the morning&#xD;
appointed for the duel. Through the livelong night, a&#xD;
gentle sea-breeze had graciously cooled the atmosphere, as&#xD;
&#xD;
if moved by the fanning, wings of' some protecting angel.&#xD;
Mildmay rose just at the dawn of day, possessed with but&#xD;
one idea, ~and that was, how he could best account' to&#xD;
Annie for his early morning ride. Supposing that he had&#xD;
escaped from his room unobserved by her ~atehful eyes,&#xD;
he had a1r~ady prepared himself ifor departure; and had&#xD;
just taken his musket from its hangings, when her light&#xD;
footsteps were heard upon the stairs.&#xD;
'Mildmay at the sound pressed the deadly weapon&#xD;
against his heart, and casting his eyes upward, muttered,&#xD;
"God of Heaven I have mercy on me!" and then as-&#xD;
sinning his usually quiet expression, he stepped quickly&#xD;
but with painful feelings of embarrassment into the halL&#xD;
Annie that morning looked even more than usually charm-&#xD;
ing. Her flowing robe was but negligently closed at the&#xD;
throat, which displayed her beautiful neck to its gi~eatest&#xD;
advantage; her smile was most enehanting,-her step free,&#xD;
-and she appeared the very personification of genial good-&#xD;
ness and, wifely beauty.&#xD;
"Upon my word," ~aid she, with a marry laugh, as&#xD;
her eyes met Mildmay's,-" upon my word, GraJiam, I shall&#xD;
begin to be jealous of the goddess Diana, if you thus stecd&#xD;
away to her retreats."&#xD;
Graham breathed more freely, as he found Aianie had'&#xD;
suggested a reason for his conduct, and quickly replied:&#xD;
"You know that the deer are early risers, Annie, and&#xD;
if caught at all, it ~must be while the dew is on the&#xD;
OTound"&#xD;
"Perhaps~so," said tbke young wife, "perhaps so; but&#xD;
do you know, Graham," placing. her a~n~ upon his shoul-&#xD;

&#xD;
der, as they walked towards the lawn, "that I could not&#xD;
have the heart to shoot any thing; "even the looks of&#xD;
that poor buck you brought home the other day, made me&#xD;
feel sad,~its glazed and liquid eyes haunt me even now."&#xD;
It seemed to Graham that iron hooks had a hold upon&#xD;
his heart, tearing it asunder, and then crushing it with&#xD;
the weight; but he maintained himself:, and replied:&#xD;
"There is enough of the savage life in us, Annie, in&#xD;
spite of our civilization, to make the sports of the field&#xD;
sometimes agreeable; I. think, perhaps, a dash of the wild&#xD;
man forms a useful alloy for even the noblest natures."&#xD;
"What you prove by example," said Annie, "leaves&#xD;
no room for argument; but you will come back soon, will&#xD;
you not?" and as the tender-hearted woman, all innocent&#xD;
of the fearful precipice upon which she was standing,&#xD;
asked this question, she looked at Mildmay a world of un-&#xD;
utterable love.&#xD;
"I will, Annie," said he, determined to fall dead at&#xD;
his wife's feet before he would betray himself, or awaken&#xD;
by any extraordinary emotion on hiE part her sensibilities&#xD;
to the awfttl ordeal through which she, in his person, was&#xD;
about to pass.&#xD;
"And so do," said Annie, stepping aside and gather-&#xD;
ing a white half-blown rose; and returning to Mildmay,&#xD;
she took a pin from her dress, and fastened the bud to one&#xD;
of the butto~i-holes of his coat,-~-" And so do," she re-&#xD;
peated, standing back, as if to take in the effect of the&#xD;
flower;~ "and come home soon, for I shall Wait breakfast&#xD;
for you, and Clemmy and' I will see what good thing we&#xD;
can invent to appease that hunter's appetite 'I know you&#xD;
&#xD;
will find in the woods;" and kissing Mildmay, ~he stood&#xD;
transfixed as long as he remained in sight.&#xD;
Graham looked back but once,-waved his hand, and&#xD;
turning away, pressed it~ against his forehead, and stared&#xD;
wildly into the heavens. Who, but the Infinite, could&#xD;
fathom hia thoughts !-who, save the Creator, compre-&#xD;
h end the awful struggle' in his mind between his moral&#xD;
feelings and the participation of crime, which would vio-&#xD;
late them all. How there came rushing upon him the&#xD;
precepts of peace, that had so often been enforced sand il-&#xD;
lustrated in his early education; how the form of his Sa-&#xD;
viour rose in his view, preaching peace and good-will to&#xD;
all mankind; how Annie's misery, if he fell: all these&#xD;
things rushed through his brain and heart, yet the spell&#xD;
of the demon of the duello was upon him; the heathen Ajax&#xD;
defied but the lightning,~-.a Christian now invoked the&#xD;
wrath of Almighty God!&#xD;
As Niildmay rode slowly down the road, his faithful&#xD;
body-servant followed in the rear; and tired of the silence,&#xD;
he took advantage of a favorable opportunity, and said,&#xD;
"Master, I seed a* buck in~ de old field yesterday; I.&#xD;
think you'd better turn in de lower bars, and we can pass&#xD;
right by his tracks in comm up where de hands are at&#xD;
work."&#xD;
"I'm not after bucks this morning, nor am I going to&#xD;
the field," 'replied Mildmay, relieved perhaps to hear 'a&#xD;
voice of sympathy; and then turning suddenly to the boy,&#xD;
who had come nearly alongside, he inquired, "Did~ you&#xD;
ever see a duel ?"&#xD;
"No, master," replied Governor, his eyes popping out&#xD;
&#xD;

* of his head, as if the very suggestion of such a thing had&#xD;
swelled his brain.&#xD;
'~ You will probably see one this morning," returned&#xD;
Mildmay, with solemnity; "and I charge you, as you&#xD;
value your life, never to speak of it at the Heritage until&#xD;
I tell you."&#xD;
"Yes, master," echoed Governor, the very picture of&#xD;
perturbation&#xD;
"Master, who's going to fou't ?" inquired Governor,&#xD;
his curiosity finally overcoming his other emotions.&#xD;
"You will learn in due time," returned Mildmay; and&#xD;
in another instant, he caught the sight of Gen. Bledsoe,&#xD;
who, with one or two friends, were leaping their horses&#xD;
over the partially let-down fence, showing that they had&#xD;
reached the place by coming across the fields.&#xD;
Graham saluted Gen. Bledsoe and his friends with the&#xD;
carelessness, and yet the studied courtesy, of every-day&#xD;
meetings; and then riding up to the general, he grasped&#xD;
him firmly by the hand, and by consent the two rode ahead,&#xD;
and side by side.&#xD;
"You are blessed with a fine morning, Mildmay,"&#xD;
said the general, cheerfully; "all yesterday it looked like&#xD;
rain; and I was very, glad to see it come off ~lear in&#xD;
the west, and give promise of this splendid day. And&#xD;
now," said the general, taking out his watch, "it is within&#xD;
a few minutes of the time of meeting,-did you practise,&#xD;
*   Mildmay, that hint I gave you about turning your body,&#xD;
without moving your feet?"&#xD;
"I did not," returned Mildmay, in an emphatic&#xD;
manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
A TALE OF SOUTHERN LIFE.         353&#xD;
"But you should ~have done it," said Gen. Bledsoe,&#xD;
naturally assuming the responsible position of second, and&#xD;
therefore for the time speaking with i~ore than usual free-&#xD;
dom. ~" You should have done it~ it was an easy move-&#xD;
ment, and has saved life."&#xD;
"To tell you the truth, general, I did go out a day or&#xD;
two since, and, according to your direction, Iplacedthe&#xD;
heel of my right foot in the hollow of the left, and went&#xD;
through the pantomime of firing over my left shoulder at&#xD;
an imaginary human being in my rear."&#xD;
"And what success did you have?" inquired the gen-&#xD;
eral, with animation.&#xD;
"Why," answered Mildmay, "I came home ignorant&#xD;
of what success I might have had by practice."&#xD;
A cloud passed over Gen. Bledsoe's face; he seemed&#xD;
to be angry, mortified, and filled with pity, by turns.&#xD;
Mildmay noticed it, and for the first and only time on that&#xD;
memorable day, did his eyes flash malignant fire; but he&#xD;
rode on in silence.&#xD;
Mr. Moreton's friends-and there were several who&#xD;
took a deep and actively expressed interest in "the affair"&#xD;
.-together with Col. Lee, had staid at Mr. Moreton's house&#xD;
the night before the dueL Previous to retiring, the arrange-&#xD;
ments were made for the following morning; and it was&#xD;
agreed that the party should rise early~ and after a cup of&#xD;
coffee proceed at once to the ground, and there take~a sub-&#xD;
stantial breakfast, in picnic fashion,-..Col. Lee suggesting,&#xD;
"that the display would have a fine moral effect upon the op-&#xD;
posing party; and that there was nothing so well calculated&#xD;

These things wore freely talked over in the evening,&#xD;
as the gentlemen smoked their cigars on' the gallery, after&#xD;
the children and Aunt Margaret had retired.&#xD;
Mrs. Moreton had been from the beginning perfectly&#xD;
conversant with the progress of the difficulty. At first she&#xD;
acted as a peacemaker; although she said but little; after&#xD;
a while, she commenced sympathizing with the sentiments&#xD;
of her husband and his friends, and very soon showed even&#xD;
more excitement on the subject than M~. Moreton himself.&#xD;
Danger to those she loved never entered her mind.&#xD;
The contemplated duel, therefore, from her early educa-&#xD;
tion, had no terrors, because she had wrought herself up&#xD;
to the notion, that it could amount to nothing more than a&#xD;
triumph for her husband; but how it was to be accom-&#xD;
plished had never troubled her thoughts;&#xD;
Just before the party separated for the night, Mrs.&#xD;
Moreton, i~ho had silently for a long while listened to the&#xD;
general remarks, asked:&#xD;
"You think, then, Col. Lee, that Mr. Mildmay will&#xD;
not fight ?"&#xD;
"Most decidedly," said the colonel, with a wave of the&#xD;
hand; "most decidedly," echoed the younger gentlemen,&#xD;
looking triumphantly at Mrs. Moreton.&#xD;
"Madam," continued the colonel, "if Mr. Milchnay&#xD;
had any courage at all, it has beer~ destroyed by those&#xD;
Yankees, who unforfunateiy had charge of hi~ education."&#xD;
"There cannot be a doubt of that," said a young gen-&#xD;
tleman, named Beauchamp; "he seems so afraid of a.&#xD;
&#xD;
A TALE OF SOUTH1~RN LIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
355&#xD;
&#xD;
fight, that he has made up a half-dozen difficulties to my&#xD;
knowledge. Look how he interfered to save Toadvine&#xD;
from lynching, although the fellow had killed one of his&#xD;
best nigger~; and, besides that, Mildmay said he was&#xD;
willing to trust to the law for redress. In my opinion,&#xD;
continued Beauchamp, with energy, "any man that will&#xD;
refer to the law to get satisfaction for a personal wrong, is&#xD;
a coward."&#xD;
"Not always," said Mr. Moreton, thought fully, roused&#xD;
by the sound of the offensive word used by Beauchamp;&#xD;
"not always, but it is difficult to Qvercorne early educa-&#xD;
tjon."&#xD;
"And you think, Colonel Lee, that Mr. Mildniay will&#xD;
make an apology on the ground, do you?" asked Mrs.&#xD;
Moreton, drawing her shawl closely round her shoulders,&#xD;
as she was preparing to leave. -&#xD;
"I most certainly do," replied the colonel, rising with&#xD;
the other gentlemen to bid the lady good night; and he&#xD;
continued, in a playful way, " We shall not be hard upon&#xD;
Mildmay; if he don't beg off too much, we will dismiss&#xD;
him with very little ceremony, and leave him to the degra-&#xD;
dation of his own thoughts."&#xD;
Mrs. Moreton cast a meaning look at her husband; her&#xD;
bright dark eye flashed with triumph, and with a stately&#xD;
tread, unusual to her manne~ she waved her adieus-and&#xD;
leaning upon the arm of Nr. Moreton, disappeared' from&#xD;
the presence of the gentlemen.&#xD;
"I hope," said ]3eauchamp, with an oath7 "I hope&#xD;
this Mildmay will stand fire, for I should hate to be dis-&#xD;
appointed, after all the trouble we have had.'&#xD;

"ff he will," said Col. Lee, walking pompously up and&#xD;
down, "if he will, there will be displayed the handsomest&#xD;
piece of finessing on the part of Moreton that ever dis-&#xD;
tinguished an honorable meeting. Mildmay will un-&#xD;
doubtedly shoot quick,.-.he has learnt the habit from&#xD;
deer-hunting; and by the arrangements of the duello,&#xD;
Moreton will thus draw his fire, and will have time to&#xD;
shoot Mildmay down at his leisure."&#xD;
"Excellent!" cried Beauchamp, now full of enthu-&#xD;
siasm; "excellent! and woe to the spectators that are in&#xD;
the way of Mildmay's bullet, for nobody will be safe ex-&#xD;
cept they stand close up to Moreton."&#xD;
This sally was received with a suppressed laugh by all&#xD;
the party; and helping themselves liberally to the liquors&#xD;
that stood upon the sideboard, they, one by one, preceded&#xD;
by servants bearing candles, retired for the night to their&#xD;
rooms.&#xD;
The following morning they met early in the dining-&#xD;
haU; the carriages, four in number, were at the door.&#xD;
Into one of the vehicles, under the more immediate charge&#xD;
of ]3eauchamp, was placed the "lunch," packed in cham-&#xD;
pagne baskets. Every body was in surprising spirits;&#xD;
Mr. Moreton was himself more than usually agreeable,-.&#xD;
Col. Lee never appeared to better advantage,-and Beau-&#xD;
champ said, "that this was the most agreeable excitement&#xD;
he ever had in his life."&#xD;
As the carriages were about leaving, Mrs. Moreton&#xD;

was exceedingly animated,-.--laughed at Beauchamp be-&#xD;

cause he displayed so much interest about the breakfast&#xD;
basket; and as the carriages were about to move from&#xD;
the lawn, she stepped into the parlor, and brought out&#xD;
Mr. Moreton's rifle.&#xD;
Walking to the carriage window, she handed it to her&#xD;
husband, exclaiming, "I would do more than that for the&#xD;
honor of my family.'? Mr. Moreton took the deadly wea-&#xD;
pon, gallantly kissed his wife's hand, and as the carriage&#xD;
dashed away, he continued to wave his tokens of adieu,&#xD;
which the lady returned, untiL a bend in the road caused&#xD;
the party to disappear from her sight.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
THE CATASTROPHE.&#xD;
THE place selected for "the duel" was a neck of land,. or&#xD;
rather "sand-bar," made by a ereek, which at times over-&#xD;
flowed the spot, and consequently it, presented, at low water,&#xD;
a smooth, sandy surface as level as a floor. Opposite, rose&#xD;
the high. bank of the stream, which circled round, holding&#xD;
t~e plaee of meeting, as it were, in its embrace. Tall and&#xD;
magnificent forest trees filled up the background, and some&#xD;
majestic ~specimens, in solitary grandeur, rose here and&#xD;
there, not duly rich in their own unrivalled vegetation, but&#xD;
bearing heavenward, gigantic grape and flower-bearing&#xD;
vines. The birds sang iiierrily in the boughs, and the low.&#xD;
ing kine grazed contentedly about-all in nature was har-&#xD;
* mony and peace.&#xD;
*     Mr. Moreton and hi~ friends were already upon the&#xD;
ground, when Mildmay and Gen. Bledsoe came in sight.&#xD;
The carriages in which they had come to the field, were os-&#xD;
tentatiously drawn up near by. On the ground was&#xD;
snowy napery, upon which were the remains of a splendid&#xD;
repast; in fact, Moreton and hi~ party were at the instant&#xD;
busily engaged in eating a hearty breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
"This theatrical display of eating and drinking, at a&#xD;
time like ~this, is really disgusting!" said Gen. Bled~oe to&#xD;
Mildmay-." I am sure that this was not Mr. Moreton's&#xD;
suggestion; that gentleman has been badly advised."&#xD;
In a moment more the viands were dispensed with, and&#xD;
Mr. Moreton's party shook hands with Gen, ]3ledsoe and&#xD;
Mildmay as cordially as if they had met at a picnic, in-&#xD;
stead of a hostile meeting. Mildmay went through this&#xD;
part of the ceremony with coldness; he was not yet per-&#xD;
fect master of his feelings; dissembling was still difi~eult.&#xD;
While considerable discussion was going on in subdued&#xD;
tones, between the seconds, Mildmay had, entirely alone,&#xD;
seated himself on a limb of a fallen tree Mr. Moreton,&#xD;
on the contrary, was surrounded by a number of young&#xD;
men, who seemed to he very full of suppressed humor, for&#xD;
it seemed that, if it~ were proper, they would be entiw1~'&#xD;
overcome with some excellentt joke.&#xD;
As Mildmay .sat by himself, Governor, who had not&#xD;
been upon the ground more than a moment before he comn~&#xD;
pretended the purpose of the assembling, and who was&#xD;
filled with alarm, came near, and stood behind his inaster~-.-&#xD;
an affecting statue of sorrowful interest, willing, could the&#xD;
sacrifice have been made, to give up his life to save his pro~&#xD;
sector and friend.&#xD;
In the course of a few moments Gen. ]3ledsoe walked&#xD;
up to Mildmay, and announced to him, that the prelimi-&#xD;
naries were arranged.&#xD;
"General," said M~ldmay, in reKply, "your kindness&#xD;
to me on this occasion will ever be remembered with gra~&#xD;
titude. The course I have adopted may be right or wrong,&#xD;

&#xD;
still II must beg of you to bear with me, even if I demand&#xD;
more than is conceded on occasions of this kind." G-en.&#xD;
Bledsoe bit his lip. Mildmay continued: "I this morn-&#xD;
ing make a sacrifice to public opinion, that, whatever may&#xD;
be the result, will be reflected upon by me, with sorrow,&#xD;
even to my grave. I therefore must ask of you, with most&#xD;
solemn interest, has every thing been done, compatible&#xD;
with honor, to peacefully arrange this difficulty betWeen&#xD;
myself and Mr. Moreton?"&#xD;
"Mr. Mildmay," said the general, with perceptible&#xD;
sternness, and some undisguised feeling of disdain in his&#xD;
face, "I have already assured you, over my own signa-&#xD;
ture, that every proposition for peace has been almost&#xD;
rudely r~ject~d; and I will add, that in respect to your&#xD;
feelings, I have almost compromised myself-and you,&#xD;
perhaps, by my active zeal to bring about a peaceful recon-&#xD;
ciliation."&#xD;
"'Tis well !" returned Graham. "I have no more&#xD;
to say."&#xD;
Mr. Moreton and- Mildmay, after again ceremoniously&#xD;
shaking hands, at once took their appointed places,~ at&#xD;
twenty paces apart. There was, in many respects, a dif-&#xD;
ference df appearance in the two combatants. Mr. More-&#xD;
ton had the air of a perfect gentleman, in th~ maturity of&#xD;
life; the slight tinge Qf gray that was discovered in his&#xD;
hair, when illuminated in the sunshine, gaveinterest to his&#xD;
face. He was perfectly self-possessed ~nd affable: His&#xD;
whole exp;ressiqp denoted a person of high education, who&#xD;
was about to perform~ an important, but necessary act.&#xD;
Mildmoy, on th~contrary, had evidently not yet reached&#xD;
&#xD;
A TALE OF SOUThERN LIFE.          361&#xD;
perfect maturity. His face was noble, and full~ of deep,&#xD;
abiding, solemn thought; it was painfully interesting, to&#xD;
see so much responsibility marked upon so young a brow.&#xD;
As he rose to his full height, he was certainly as perfect&#xD;
a specimen of manly beauty, as was ever seen.&#xD;
Gen. Bledsoe, who, from the moment when he'flrst saw&#xD;
Mildmay, had conceived a high idea of his qualities in&#xD;
every respect; when he came upon the ground, became so&#xD;
solicitous that Mildmay should sustain himself by the&#xD;
most approved bearing, that he unconsciously became af-&#xD;
fected with the sentiments of Mr. Moreton's friends, and&#xD;
feared that, possibly, Mildmay might at the critical mo-&#xD;
ment, "compromise himself" and this feeling was some-&#xD;
what confirmed by INtildmay's just reiterated desire to know&#xD;
"if every amicable proposition had been rejected?"&#xD;
The principals were at their places, their weapons in&#xD;
their hands-when Gen. Bledsoe, his face full of deep sym-&#xD;
pathy, walked close up to Mildmay, and whispered in his&#xD;
ear:&#xD;
~C Mildmay, if there be a doubt in your mind, about&#xD;
your firmness on this occasion, if your conscientious scru-&#xD;
ples overcome your courage, let me take your place. ILe-&#xD;
member that the same blood courses through our veiny.-&#xD;
Jitetty Bledsoe sl&amp;amp;ould not be disgraced upon tiw field."&#xD;
"Stand back!" said Mildmay, with impassioned&#xD;
energy. "Do your duty~ my fAend!" continued he, in a&#xD;
calmed' tone, "I will not forget mine.&#xD;
's/God bless you for that!" said Bledsoe, the~ tear&#xD;
struggling, in his eye. "Now Mildmay, my boy!" added&#xD;
he, with vivacity, "tear that flower from your breast; it -&#xD;

&#xD;
is a better 'mark, against your dark dress than ever was a&#xD;
'bulPs eye' on a target."&#xD;
Mildmay looked~ down, and there, in all its innocent&#xD;
loveliness, was Annie's last tribute of affection, still fresh&#xD;
in the morning dews; .the young husband plucked it from&#xD;
its place, and thrusting it into his breast, so that it rested&#xD;
upon his heart, he turned to his second, and with a firm&#xD;
voice said:&#xD;
"I am ready."&#xD;
Cob Lee, who had the ordering of the preliminaries,&#xD;
the moment 'he heard Mildmay's remark, with professional&#xD;
solemnity asked:&#xD;
"Gentlemen, ar~ you ready~"&#xD;
"We are ready!" was mutually answered.&#xD;
"Then, gentlemen," said Col. Lee, with a loud voice,&#xD;
"upon my repeating again the question, 'Are you ready,'&#xD;
you are to answer 'Yes.' ]i~ shall then say, fire, one-&#xD;
two-three."&#xD;
At this instant, Mildmay, who was standing with his&#xD;
musket resting in the hollow of his left arm, to the aston-&#xD;
ishment of all present; dropped the butt upu!~ the ground&#xD;
and said:&#xD;
"Col. Lee, I desire some inforniatiom~."&#xD;
Gen. Bledsoe, who was now of conrs~ compelled to be&#xD;
a silent spectator, felt a sickness coi~e over him, when&#xD;
Mildmay appeared thus so unnecessarily to interrupt the&#xD;
proceedings, while a look of sarcastic significance passed&#xD;
between Moreton's friends, IBeauchamp whispering, "Mild-&#xD;
may's going to faint~"&#xD;
&#xD;
A TALE OF SOUTHERN LIFE.          3(33&#xD;
"~What is it, sir?" said Col, Lee, impatiently, at the&#xD;
same time,~ turning to the questioner.&#xD;
"Do I understand aright, Cob Lee," said Mildmay,&#xD;
with an affectedly slow emphasis, ~" that I can fire at a fly&#xD;
time between the counts of 'one-..--two----.three.'"&#xD;
"You can, sir!" answered Col. Lee, waring his hand&#xD;
with authority.&#xD;
Upon hearing which, Mildmay very slowly stooped&#xD;
down, and pinching up some dry dust between .the thumb&#xD;
and fore-finger of his right~~and ,-~--without speaking, si~.&#xD;
unified that he understood the arrangement, and instantly&#xD;
assumed his proper position.&#xD;
Gen. Bledsoe, whose confidence in Mildmay's firmness&#xD;
had been so terribly shaken, by what appeared to be his&#xD;
ill-opportuned interruption; instantly caught the deep in-&#xD;
tent of Mildmay's question, and the reason of his apparent&#xD;
desire to fortify his finger against the possibility of slip-&#xD;
ping on the trigger; it flashed upon him, like lightning,&#xD;
that it was all to derange Moreton's calculations about&#xD;
Mildmay's making a quick fire, and Gen. Bledsoe, whose&#xD;
heart, a moment before, was near collapsing with fear; with&#xD;
a thrill of admiration, could now with difficulty restrain him~&#xD;
self from falling on Mlldmay's neck, and bursting into tears.&#xD;
Both. Moreton and Mildmay now seemed conscious that&#xD;
the instant of action had arrived, for they simultaneously&#xD;
and courteously raised their weapons, as if "presenting&#xD;
arms." Cot Lee again, in a solemn voice asked:&#xD;
"Gentlemen,'~are you ready?"&#xD;
The combatants simultaneously answered, "We are!"&#xD;
Then said Col. Lee:&#xD;

&#xD;
"Gentlemen,-FniE-----one--.-."&#xD;
The numeral had hardly escaped the lips of Lee, be-&#xD;
fore the crashing sound of Mildmay's musket echoed far&#xD;
and wide, ~tnd Moreton, with his weapon undischarged,&#xD;
sprang perpendicularly in the air, and then fell lumbering&#xD;
to the earth; for an instant, his body trembled like an as-&#xD;
pen leaf; he essayed to raise himself; and amid gurgling&#xD;
sounds, could be faintly distinguished the words, "My&#xD;
wife-my children !" and then, with a long-drawn sigh, he&#xD;
fell back-a corpse.&#xD;
Mildinay, still standing in his place, gazed sadly at the&#xD;
group now kneeling about the lifeless form of the once&#xD;
splendid Mr. Moreton; and then, handing his weapon to&#xD;
Governor, who could scarce conceal his exultation at the&#xD;
result, he mechanically moved toward )~4* horse.&#xD;
But ere he reached his place of destination, 0-en. Bled-&#xD;
soc, who had instinctively rushed toward the dying man,&#xD;
now turned to Mildmay; and seizing him by the hand, he&#xD;
shook it convulsively, and looking him affectionately in the&#xD;
face, said:&#xD;
Mildmay, thank God ~jou are safe, and you have, this&#xD;
day, added lustre to the bearing of a gentleman."&#xD;
CoL Lee next came forward, and with a most courtly&#xD;
salute, he said: "Mr. Mild~nay, I have had the extreme&#xD;
pleasure of acting as 'a friend,' on many similar occa-&#xD;
sions, and in none, that I can remember, or that I have&#xD;
heard of; have the strict rules of honor bee~i morer faith-&#xD;
fully preserved; your conduct to-day is above all praise."&#xD;
Mildm~y listened to these strangely sounding congratu-&#xD;
lations, as if he were in a dream, but rallying his thoughts,&#xD;

he bade all present a general adieu; mounted his horse, and&#xD;
closely followed by Governor, slowly rode away.&#xD;
"What a trump he is!" said Beauchamp, the moment&#xD;
Mildmay was out of hearing. "What a trump! he has,&#xD;
this morning, established himself in society; every honor&#xD;
and office is henceforth open to him. I wonder whether&#xD;
he will decide to ge to Congress?"&#xD;

ChAPTER XXX.&#xD;
THE WIDOW AND ORPHANS.&#xD;
THE moment that Mr. Moreton left his house with the gay&#xD;
party, Aunt Margaret went 'into her~ room, and throwing&#xD;
herself on, her knees, in an intense agony of prayer, she&#xD;
called on her Heavenly Father to enlighten the heart of&#xD;
her brother and his friends, and save the effusion of blood.&#xD;
"But," she concluded, "if the wrath of offended Heaven is&#xD;
upon us for our many sins, prepare our hearts for the aw-&#xD;
ful responsibilities that await us." While thus pouring&#xD;
out her very soul for divine grace, Toots, who had been&#xD;
much 'amused by the attention of the gentlemen, and the&#xD;
bustle preceding her father's departure, missing Aunt Mar-&#xD;
garet, promptly proceeded to her room, and bursting in the&#xD;
door, 2she saw her dear relative, who wa~ still in the atti-&#xD;
tude~ of prayer, in tears.&#xD;
"Why, what's matter?" asked Toots, throwing her little&#xD;
arms around Aunt Margaret's neck; "what's you cry for?&#xD;
won't Jemima weed the flower-beds?"&#xD;
"Oh, nothing, my dear, ,dear child I" said 'Aunt Mar-&#xD;
&#xD;
garet pressing her little niece to her 'bosom; "nothing, my&#xD;
sweet one, Jemixna did weed the flower-beds."&#xD;
"I am glad of it," said Toots, with comical pomposity;&#xD;
and unconsciously imitating her father's manner-" I am&#xD;
glad of it; I'd like misef to see any one that didn't mind&#xD;
what Aunty says."&#xD;
The smile of affection that passed over Aunt Margaret's&#xD;
face, formed curious channels for a flood of tears; and&#xD;
again kissing Toots, and heaving a deep sigh, she said:&#xD;
"Run down stairs, my little one, and see if dear papa&#xD;
has come."&#xD;
Away went Toots, her little feet pattering like hail&#xD;
upon the wax-polished 'floor; and rushing to the gallery,&#xD;
she saw her mother walking nervously up and down its&#xD;
ample length.&#xD;
Now the sight of her mother thus spiritedly walking&#xD;
astonished Toots, and joined with the scene just enacted&#xD;
by her aunt, the child appeared to comprehend that some-&#xD;
thing unusual had occurred and catching hold of her&#xD;
mother's dress, she said:&#xD;
"Muddy, Aunt Margaret's crying up stairs -who's'&#xD;
hurt her, muddy?"&#xD;
Mrs. Moreton rolled her large and brilliant eyes down&#xD;
upon Toots, as if the child had' suddenly stung her in the&#xD;
heart; and drawing her arms across h~r bo~orn, while two&#xD;
scalding tears fell upon the ~Ioor, ~he said: 2.:&#xD;
"Call Fanny, child, and go and see the chickens fed;&#xD;
ah, that's a dear."&#xD;
Toias bounced around, and in another minute was in the&#xD;
kitchen, ordering the servant to the appointed task, and&#xD;

368             THE MA5TEU'5 HOUSE;                                               A TALE OF SOUTHERN. LIFE.         369&#xD;
&#xD;
rattling oii with directions, it appeared, as if her tongue&#xD;
would never be still.&#xD;
Mrs. Moreton continued to pace the gallery; the time&#xD;
which her husband said he would be absent had already&#xD;
passed, and there was a faint sensation-an unaccountable&#xD;
feeling about her heart: "Who hurt Aunt Margaret ?.-.&#xD;
what did the child mean?" these questiqiis she repeated&#xD;
to herself, as a sense of danger, like a dark cloud, com-&#xD;
menced settling around her.&#xD;
"Oh, I am sure nothing serious has happened to&#xD;
Moreton," she soliloquized; "did not Colonel Lee tell me&#xD;
that Mildmay 'wouldn't fight,' and did~ not all my hus-&#xD;
band's friends, assure me that there was no danger? IL am&#xD;
sure it was only a harmless pastime," and the poor lady's&#xD;
face turned alarmingly pale.&#xD;
While in this frame~ of mind, the carriage, containing&#xD;
Mr. Moreton's body, and those accompanying it, were seen&#xD;
winding their way slowly through the forc~t. The wife&#xD;
was now all alarm. She struggled, as if smothering for&#xD;
want of air. Placing her delicate hand over her eyes, she&#xD;
looked at the approaching procession as if she would see&#xD;
through the solid sides of the vehicles.&#xD;
"Myt God! my God!" she exclaimed, now nearly&#xD;
frantic; "I know that something must have happened.&#xD;
Moreton would never come home so slowly, if he were not&#xD;
wounded:" and rushing into the house, she fairly screamed,&#xD;
"Aunt Margaret, do come here ! "-and exhausted with&#xD;
emotion, she sank almost lifeless in a chair.&#xD;
The beloved form of Aunt Margaret was instantly&#xD;
at the head of the stairs; she descended with more&#xD;
&#xD;
than usual ~calmness her eyes were still red with weep-&#xD;
ing,-her face was~ pale, but firm; she seemed armed with&#xD;
a superhuman strength, as if prepared to do her duty,&#xD;
whatever it might be.&#xD;
"What is the matter, dear Olotilde ?" said Aunt Mar-&#xD;
garet, standing over the reclining form of Mrs. INloreton.&#xD;
"Matter!" echoed the lady, with fierce animation;&#xD;
"matter! Has not Moreton been hurt ?-did you ever&#xD;
know his carriage to approach the house at that snail's&#xD;
pace?" and she pointed with her finger to the cortege,&#xD;
that was now entirely visible through the wide-opened&#xD;
door.&#xD;
"Be calm, dear sister! I hope that all is well !" and&#xD;
Aunt Margaret herself became a statue of interest, as she&#xD;
watched the carriages approach.&#xD;
In a moment more, they drew up in front of the lawn,&#xD;
and Col. Lee, with a slow and dignified tread, opened the&#xD;
front gate, and came toward the house.&#xD;
Mrs. Moreton stared at his approaching figure uiitil no&#xD;
longer able to contain herself; she then leaped from&#xD;
Aunt Margaret, and absolutely flew across the lawn to&#xD;
meet Col. Lee.&#xD;
"He's only wounded?" said she, her hands raised in&#xD;
an imploring attitude.&#xD;
"Wounded!" echoed the colonel, for an instant over-&#xD;
come by the unexpected appearance of Mrs. Moreton.&#xD;
"I am sorry to say," replied the colonel-"" I am sorry&#xD;
to say, madam, that Mr. Moreton is wounded an4-"&#xD;
But before the "accomplished second" could finish his&#xD;
explanation, the i~b; in a perfect frenzy, rushed past him,&#xD;

&#xD;
and reached the gate, just as her husband's body had been&#xD;
drawn clear of the carriage, and was extended at full length&#xD;
in the arms of its bearers.&#xD;
Now, so intent were the parties in their occupation of&#xD;
carrying the dead, that they did not perceive Mrs~ More-&#xD;
ton's intrusion, and she, having a full and undisturbed&#xD;
glance of her husband's face, as the ihead rolled from side&#xD;
to side in the stepping movement of being borne along,&#xD;
she comprehended in an instant the full extent of her loss;&#xD;
and with one piercing shriek, she threw herself upon the&#xD;
lifeless body.&#xD;
For a moment she gazed upon the expressionless face,&#xD;
and stared wildly at those about her. "Gentlemen," she&#xD;
said, pushing her luxuriant hair from her forehead-" gen-&#xD;
tlemen, this iS not reality-this is all a horrid dream!&#xD;
Jt cannot be !-it cannot be!" and she laid her delicate&#xD;
hand upon the silent heart of the dead before her.&#xD;
For an instant her mind seemed to wander, and then&#xD;
the startling truth came like a mighty avalanche upon her&#xD;
soul; and throwing herself back, she raised her hand to&#xD;
heaven, and screamed, "God Almighty! have mercy-&#xD;
have mercy !" and again prostrating herself upon the body&#xD;
~f Mr. Moreton, she moaned like a child, and then ex-&#xD;
claimed, "Have mercy, oh God! have mercy !-this cannot&#xD;
-shall not be!'?&#xD;
Col. Lee was instantly at the lady's side, and with a&#xD;
manner that would have done honor to him if he had been&#xD;
offering to assist a lady to her carriage, he said:&#xD;
"Mrs.. Moreton, -permit me to hand you into the&#xD;
house?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Touch me not!" said the lady, springing to her feet,&#xD;
and drawing herself up, as if abt~ut to be stung by an&#xD;
adder, and pointing her finger scornfully in his face; "to~ach&#xD;
me not, I say, you slimy and vile hypocrite! How dare&#xD;
you, sir," 'she continued, her eyes fairly flashing lurid&#xD;
fire-" how dare you, sir, offer to assist me, whom you&#xD;
have this day robbed of a husband? Go, sir, from my&#xD;
presence, or the servants shall chastise your impudence--&#xD;
shall lash you to your grave! Go!" she hysterically&#xD;
sighed, with a softened voice-" go, and at once, for niur-&#xD;
derers are ye all! Go! ere the blight of Heaven, the sor-&#xD;
rows of orphan children, and the sighs of a heart-broken&#xD;
wife, drive you like myself-mad-.-mad-mad!"&#xD;
Then breaking into merry teals of laughter, she&#xD;
moaned: "IIe's coming! I sec him now, and his arms&#xD;
are open to meet me! 'Twas a cruel jest, gentlemen, to&#xD;
trifle thus with my fears! Oh, God! he's pale-there's&#xD;
blood upon him!" and again would Mrs. Moreton have&#xD;
clasped to her bosom' the inanimate ~form before her, when&#xD;
a fearful darkness overspread her face, and in another&#xD;
moment she was literally carried raving into the house.&#xD;
At the door stood the children, all pale and sorrow~&#xD;
stricken, and curious to know what was the meaning of&#xD;
the fearful scenes enacted before 'them; comprehending&#xD;
at length something of their misfortune, they mingled their&#xD;
lamentations with the' sobs of the mother, that now could&#xD;
be heard from an adjoining room.&#xD;
Amid this distress, Aunt Margaret moved about with&#xD;
all the dignity aDd mercy of an angel; she comforted one,'&#xD;
and then another,-directed the distracted servants, and&#xD;

tried to soothe the violent paroxysms of sorrow, that con-&#xD;
stantly passed in awful throes through the heart of the&#xD;
fearfully stricken Mrs. Moreton.&#xD;
In the mean time, the inanimate form of the once fond&#xD;

Col. iLiee, and the gentlemen with him, now clustered&#xD;
around each other in the gallery hall, haggard-.-abso-&#xD;
lutely paralyzed with terror; Col. Lee alone maintained&#xD;
any presence of mind, and remarked, with a forced compo-&#xD;
sure, which he did not feel:&#xD;
"You see, gentlemen, this was a very unfortunate&#xD;
affair-very! Mrs. Moreton will, however, recover in a&#xD;
day or two. The fact is, that Mildmay deceived us by&#xD;
his looks; he was evidently much misrepresented: we had&#xD;
bet1~r see Mrs. Marbury (Aunt Margaret), and make ar-&#xD;
rangements for calling in a physician, an~&amp;amp; such friends as&#xD;
the family may desire."&#xD;
A servant was sent, by the gentlemen, for Aunt Mar-&#xD;
garet, and when she made her appearance, she had just&#xD;
succeeded in getting Mrs. Moreton into a troubled sleep,&#xD;
and left her in the charge of a faithful domestic.&#xD;
It was arranged that some of the female members of a&#xD;
neighboring family, should be at once sent for; the mes-&#xD;
senger for' a physician had already been dispatched.&#xD;
After a hurried conversation, carried on in suppressed&#xD;
whispers, A&#xD;
senee was n:nt Margaret satisfied Col. Lee, that his pre-&#xD;
Jonger necessary, and begged him to leave,&#xD;
with him, hjs friends,&#xD;
&#xD;
The .~entlemen felt exceedingly embarrassed; to go&#xD;
away without doing something to alleviate the misery be-&#xD;
fore them, seemed mortifying indeed, and yet they were&#xD;
powerless, to afford' consolation.&#xD;
While Aunt MargaDet stood in the door, evidently in-&#xD;
tending to close it at the moment the gentlemen disap-&#xD;
peared, there came from Mrs. Moreton's room a continued&#xD;
repetition of fearful shrieks and screams, and in another&#xD;
instant, the lady herself, pale as death, rushed upon the&#xD;
gallery, holding at arm's length, a letter. Without seem-&#xD;
ing to notice any one, she strode a few paces, and in a&#xD;
plaintive voice, said:&#xD;
"Mildmay begged for peace, God help him !-.Mlldmay&#xD;
begged for peace,-here's his very words!" and she pressed&#xD;
the letter to her eyes, as if still unConSCiouS of the full&#xD;
meaning of its contents.&#xD;
The ~entlemen were now completely embarrassed.&#xD;
Mrs. Moreton was in a loose dress, and her luxuriant hair&#xD;
streamed over her shoulders. Delicacy bade them precipi-&#xD;
tately retreat, still they remained as if 'fascinated to the&#xD;
spot.&#xD;
Aunt Margaret, the moment she recovered her self-pos-&#xD;
session, went to Mrs. Moreton, and placing her hand upon&#xD;
that lady's shoulder, said:&#xD;
"Sister, be calm! let's into the house."&#xD;
"Calm! calm!" echoed Mrs. Moreton, dwelling upon&#xD;
the word, until it thrilled all who heard it, with horroi~.&#xD;
"Do you bid me be calm ?-me, Aunt Margaret,~ ~ho&#xD;
have 'been robbed of the best of husbands, and' thuit too,&#xD;
by villains, and fiends, who cpnspired against his life, and&#xD;

&#xD;
who have accomplished, by the hands of another, what they&#xD;
dared not have done themselves?"&#xD;
"Sister, dear sister!" said Aunt Margaret, clasping&#xD;
the frantic lady round the neek.&#xD;
At this moment the dark lu~tious eyes of Mrs. More-&#xD;
ton, always ®so beautiful, but now, brilliant with insanity,&#xD;
rested upon Col. Lee and his followers, who were cowering&#xD;
in trembling groups near her; with gigantic strength she&#xD;
tore herself away from 'all restraint, and advancing toWard&#xD;
CQJ. Lee and his asso~iates,-she exclaimed:&#xD;
"Cowards are ye all, vile ~cowards! Murderers of a&#xD;
man you called your friend-.you have partaken of his hos-&#xD;
pitality, iand plotted his death under his own roof,-look&#xD;
at your w'6rk-look'at me!" and Mrs. Moreton raised her-&#xD;
self up like ~ queen of the tragic muse. "Look at those&#xD;
fatherless children,.-may the blood of the dead be upon&#xD;
your craven souls! You told me, as ~you told him, that&#xD;
Mildmay would not flght-.--you lied-upon your souls, you&#xD;
knew you lied!"&#xD;
"For-tnercy'~ sake, dear sister! for mercy's sake de-&#xD;
sist!" said Aunt Margaret, throwing her arms around Mrs.&#xD;
Moreton's neck, and for the first time that fearful morning,&#xD;
that faithfizl friend burst into tears.~&#xD;
Again Mrs. Moreton tore herself away, 'and still in-&#xD;
tent npon pouring out her feelings, where for the moment&#xD;
they centered, she waved her hand at CQL Lee, and badc&#xD;
him~" begone," and then continued, with even more vehe-&#xD;
mence than ever, "leave this house; it is polluted by your&#xD;
presetice. Go I sand may the execrations of all good and&#xD;
brav&amp;amp; men, pui~sue you; ma~ the scalding tears you have&#xD;
&#xD;
seen shed to-day, burn your craven hearts! may all moth-&#xD;
ers and wives spurn and despise 'you." And Mrs. More-&#xD;
ton, struggling for a moment as one smothering for want&#xD;
of air, swooned, and fell into Aunt Margaret's arms.&#xD;
Col. Lee and his friends heard all, like men entranced,&#xD;
and they trembled and blanched, as if moved about by an&#xD;
earthquake, but when the terms "cravens-murderers----&#xD;
cowards," were hurled in their faces, the crimson blood of&#xD;
shame seemed ready t? break through their cheeks and&#xD;
foreheads, and their ears burned as if they were on fire.&#xD;
"Go, I beseech you, gentlemen!" said Aunt Marga-&#xD;
ret, looking toward the lawn, as she assisted in supporting&#xD;
the insensible form of her widowed sister. "Go! and&#xD;
may God forgive you for your participation in this day's&#xD;
sad work."&#xD;
The calm voice of Aunt Margaret broke the charm, and&#xD;
they moved away, like condemned culprits, from before the&#xD;
desolation they themselves had made. For the moment,&#xD;
the mark of Cain was on their brows, the gnawing of ter-&#xD;
rible remorse was at their hearts, and for the moment,&#xD;
they even envied the calmness and the insensibility, that&#xD;
rested upon the form of the dead.&#xD;
The full extent of the labors of love performed by Aunt&#xD;
Margaret, that day, is recorded in heaven. Never be-&#xD;
fore, perhaps, had so kind a heart been so severely taxed;&#xD;
every feeling had been wrung to its utmost sensibility, and~&#xD;
on the night of that awful day, when nature had stifled the&#xD;
sobs of orphaned children to sleep, when Mrs. Moroton,&#xD;
her face distorted by the conflicts of her mind, sunk from&#xD;
physical exhaustion into temporary quiet, then, and not&#xD;

&#xD;
until then, did Aunt Margaret steal from the room, to look&#xD;
at the cold remains of her only, her most affectionate&#xD;
brother ;~ and removing the napkin that covered that once&#xD;
loved face, she gazed steadily awhile, a tear or two came&#xD;
to her relief and lifting up her eyes, she thanked Heaven,&#xD;
that amidst all the' suffering around her, she could see&#xD;
one placid expression, even if it were caused by that sleep,&#xD;
which, until the resurrection morn, knows no waking.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXI.&#xD;
THE PENALTY.&#xD;
ON reaching home, Mildmay threw the bridle rein upo&#xD;
his horse's neck, and entered the lawn; Ponce de Leon hac&#xD;
as usual, watched his coming from a distance, and with on&#xD;
of his vast leaps, was about fawning upon his master, whe:&#xD;
he discovered something in 1~tildmay's eye, that made hit&#xD;
shrink back, and whine with terror-on Mildmay strodE&#xD;
as if some fiend were in pursuit, and treading heavily a&#xD;
he walked into the house, he placed his gun upon its ac&#xD;
customer hooks, and presented himself in the breakfast&#xD;
room.&#xD;
At the table ~at Annie, evidently awaiting~his coming&#xD;
but, as she looked up and saw Graham, she uttered an ex&#xD;
clamation of surprise, and then seemed petrified into&#xD;
statue of alarm.&#xD;
"I thought you knew my walk!" said he, with undis&#xD;
guided sarcasm, gloomily taking his seat.&#xD;
Annie still stared, her face working with strange anc&#xD;
terrible emotion, while her' eyes, to herself; seemed ulltru(&#xD;
in their vision, and bowing her head, she sighed..-.&#xD;

&#xD;
'I do know your walk; Graham!" and then looking up&#xD;
with increasing alarm,, she continued, "but that was not&#xD;
your step I just now heard."&#xD;
"It was I!" answered Graham, with a sneer, and then&#xD;
he literally snarled though hi~ teeth, "the ears of love&#xD;
grow dull by time."&#xD;
"Graham!" exclaimed Annie, and turning deadly&#xD;
pale, and rising straight up from her seat, she fell toward&#xD;
him, as stiff and cold' as, if she had been marble.&#xD;
Graham' caught the insensible form of his wife, and&#xD;
held it as firmly, and remorselessly as if it were really an&#xD;
inanimate thing. Glaring down upon the closed eyes and&#xD;
pale face of the beautiful and innocent Annie, he tried to&#xD;
recollect what was his relation to the being he held in his&#xD;
arms; he haJ, for the moment, no distinct idea of the rela-&#xD;
tion of wife; 'wandering, to him an age, in the undefined&#xD;
regions of horrid uncertainty, he first remembered his&#xD;
early associations iii Malden; and by degrees, and sl&amp;amp;w&#xD;
and painful' progress, he traced his acquaintance with An..&#xD;
nie, through courtship and marriage.-and carefully con-&#xD;
necting the incidents, the truth finally dawned upon him,&#xD;
who ~he really was and for the relief of hi~ breaking heart,&#xD;
scalding tears ran streaming from his eyes.&#xD;
His mind once enlightened, he bore Annie to a couch,&#xD;
and the intense, solicitude he felt lest the vital spark had&#xD;
lied, was a temporary relief from the tenfold more terrible&#xD;
burden that crushed his heart.&#xD;
The moment that she was left to herself, the currents&#xD;
of life slowly returned to their channels; sh~ sighed and&#xD;
moaned as one waking from a deep and almost fatal sleep;&#xD;
&#xD;
A TALE OF SOUTHERN LiFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
3,79&#xD;
&#xD;
and at last, with her eyes still closed, she reached out her&#xD;
hands, and ejaculated:&#xD;
"Mother, where's Graham?"&#xD;
"Here I am," he answered, leaning oVer her prostrate&#xD;
form.&#xD;
"And is this truly my Graham'?" said the stricken&#xD;
wife, her face still full of doubt.&#xD;
"Annie," said Mildmay, supporting her 'in his arms,&#xD;
"since we last parted, I have' passed through dangers&#xD;
which you cannot comprehend;. I have been tempted by&#xD;
the evil one, and have fallen a victim. I have those&#xD;
about me who have sought to destroy not only 'my life, but&#xD;
my honor;" and here Mildmay became too choked for ut-&#xD;
terance.&#xD;
"Passed through dangers!" murmured Annie, with&#xD;
increasing strength and interest. "Tell me, what is this&#xD;
fatal secret !-why this change! Do you not love me,&#xD;
Graham? do you not know Annie ?-have you forgotten&#xD;
your wife?"&#xD;
Annie," said Graham, his face resuming some of its&#xD;
natural expression,-" Annie, a cloud has settled upon&#xD;
us; the peace of our once happy home is destroyed for ever!&#xD;
my life is now valueless! I have shed human blood, and&#xD;
the never-dying worm of remorse is eating at' my heart."'&#xD;
Annie now in an instant comprehended all, still the&#xD;
particulars ~wete vague and undefined. There passed&#xD;
through her mind a thousand things 'before utinoticed,&#xD;
which, when considered together, led her to the correct&#xD;
result; and throwing her arms ~bout Mildniay's neck, she&#xD;
wept and sobbed like a child.&#xD;
&#xD;

A TALE OF SOUTHERN LIFE1         381&#xD;
&#xD;
380             THE MASTER'S HOUSE;&#xD;
&#xD;
It was while Annie was t1~us pouring out her feelings&#xD;
upou Mildm~iy's beast, that her form seemed again to&#xD;
melt in unity with his own; the consciousness of the pos-&#xD;
session of her unwavering love returned to him as a dim&#xD;
star glimmering in a dark and stormy sky,-and as she&#xD;
looke&amp;amp;up in his face, he pressed one long and earnest kiss&#xD;
of redemption upon her brow.&#xD;
Time wore heavily on. Two persons inhabited that&#xD;
once pleasant home, who appeared careworn, despondent-.&#xD;
prematurely old. There were times of momentary peace,&#xD;
-rays of sunshine occasionally broke forth, but the clouds&#xD;
would always overpower in the struggle, and leave a deeper&#xD;
gloom.&#xD;
Neither Annie nor Graham ever alluded to the cause&#xD;
of all this sorrow. The young wife redoubled her efforts&#xD;
to render her husband's home cheerful, but she found in&#xD;
her despair that all her efforts affected only his physical&#xD;
comfort,-his mind she could not reach.&#xD;
The master and mistress 'of Heritage Place endeavored&#xD;
to resume, at least outwardly, their accustomed manner of&#xD;
life. Both felt that they were now more than ever neces-&#xD;
sary for each other's existence-the word "happiness"&#xD;
they dared not utter. Occasionally a calm would come&#xD;
over their household, but some unpleasant reminiscence -&#xD;
connected with 'the duel would be rudely thrust upon them,&#xD;
and" their' bark oC life would suddenly ground upon the&#xD;
sands of desolate recollections.&#xD;
The duel became a matter of newspaper notoriety;&#xD;
"public opinion," which would have been foremost in ~de-&#xD;
nouncing Mildmay if he had obeyed the reasoning of his&#xD;
&#xD;
own conscience, and "refused to fight," was now poured&#xD;
out in news-paragraphical sympathy for the deceased,..-&#xD;
for the "fatherless chuldren,"-for the "widowe&amp;amp; ai~d&#xD;
afflicted mother:" and as these statements and' reflections&#xD;
spread, they became exaggerated, and rolled back from the&#xD;
distance in a dark cloud ~of condemnation on duelling, and&#xD;
on the head of ."the monster Graham Mildmay," who was&#xD;
finally represented as "a desperado of the Southwest,&#xD;
seeking by every means in his power, to imbrue his hands in&#xD;
human blood."&#xD;
It 'was these things 'that continually gave activity to&#xD;
the misery that rested upon the inmates of Heritage&#xD;
Place, and destroyed in the minds of Graham and Annie&#xD;
the little consolation that would have arisen in the. thought&#xD;
that their sorrows were confined to their own domestic&#xD;
circle, and sanctified by the privacy ~f their own hearts.&#xD;
Instead of this, the idea~ haunted their sensitive spirits&#xD;
that a million eyes 'of the thoughtless public were staring&#xD;
upon them from the surrounding woild, and that they were&#xD;
never again to be free from 'observation-.-never again, to&#xD;
be alone.&#xD;
The enervating influences of a Southern climate, mean-&#xD;
while, had their effect upon Annie. At the very time of&#xD;
the occurrence of the sad incidents that so severely wounded&#xD;
her spirit, she was in the critical time of acclimation,&#xD;
and consequently, least capable, so far as her physical&#xD;
health was concerned, to bear so great a shock. Her in-&#xD;
tense desire to soothe Graham under his misfortunes ren-&#xD;
dered her blind to her own declining strength; and when&#xD;
Graham became conscious 'that she was, and had been,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC8057-00000196"/>&#xD;
382             TH1~ MASTER'S nousn;                                              A TALE OF SOUTHERN LIFE.          383&#xD;
&#xD;
perhaps, a long time sinking under her weight of sorrow, a&#xD;
new cause of alarm thrilled his soul.&#xD;
The subject once '~broached by Graham, the language&#xD;
of sympathy broke Annie's silence regarding herself, and&#xD;
she acknowledged that she felt that she had not long to&#xD;
live; yet There was no perceptible, or defined sickness.&#xD;
Graham now in turn became the sympathizing nurse, and&#xD;
found absolute relief in his anxiety and attentions to An-&#xD;
nie, from the more terrible feelings of remorse that still&#xD;
haunted his heart.&#xD;
"Time," he would say, taking Annie's attenuated hand&#xD;
in his own-" Time, my Annie, will assauge these regrets;&#xD;
we are young, and we will outlive the first blow of this&#xD;
terrible affliction that has come, upon us: we will know&#xD;
how to enjoy the blessings of the future by the severe les-&#xD;
son we have had of the past. You shall help me, dear&#xD;
wife, to ~atone for my errors; if we cannot be very, very&#xD;
happy, we can at least enjoy peace."&#xD;
Annie would smile,.-.would look full of hope, but if&#xD;
Graham could have been restored to that sensitiveness of&#xD;
love that possessed his heart in the "olden times," he&#xD;
would have perceived that Annie Hastings was quietly,&#xD;
but sweetly passing away; she felt it-~knew it: her only&#xD;
consolation was, that she should breathe her last in Gra~&#xD;
ham's arms, and blessing his affection, lead the way to&#xD;
Heaven. Still Annie pursued her simple occupations, and&#xD;
sometimes made even. Graham's saddened face light up&#xD;
with a~ smile at her unusual interest in some trivial ocen-&#xD;
pationwhich showed, that she still remembered tastes and&#xD;
preferences which he had formerly expressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
The desolation at Mrs. Moreton's was complete. The&#xD;
widowed mother. had only momentary glimpses of reason,&#xD;
and then relapsed into moaning, idiotic insanity. She&#xD;
mad&amp;amp; the night air thick with her complaints, and demands&#xD;
for her husband; and kneeling down, she would call on&#xD;
Heaven to for ever crush the men, "who took Mr. Moreton&#xD;
away to execution!"&#xD;
Eminent physicians came up from New Orleans, in&#xD;
hopes that their skill could do something to relieve Mrs.&#xD;
Moreton; and the result was, the temporary removal of the&#xD;
whole family to the city. As its youthful members,&#xD;
arrayed in deepest mourning, in charge of Aunt Mar-&#xD;
garet, passed though Beechland, tears were plentifully&#xD;
shed by eyes heretofore unused, to such weakness. There&#xD;
they were, orphaned, deprived of their natural protectors,&#xD;
marching in long procession, the very impersonation of&#xD;
woe. Even the vivacious Toots had become a quiet child;&#xD;
her little spirit was subdued, and, beyond insisting that&#xD;
every one should acknowledge that her younger sister (the&#xD;
baby) was good, she for the while but little resembled her&#xD;
former self.&#xD;
One of the subordinate incidents connected with the&#xD;
duel, it perhaps should be mentioned, was lhat Gol. Lee, in&#xD;
the reaction of public sentiment, came' in for his share of&#xD;
denunciation; but, as usual, when it was too late to accom-&#xD;
plish aiiy good, in checking hi~ vanity in arranging&#xD;
"points of honor." In the midst of what he considered&#xD;
a momentary decadence of his star, authentic information&#xD;
came to I3eechlaud, that the "high-toned, chivalrous re-&#xD;
presentative of 'one of the first families of Virginia, Col.&#xD;

Lee," was the son 0f a once respectable tavern-keepe~' in&#xD;
the vicinity of Colesburg; and that all the knowledge he&#xD;
had of horses, or good society, was what he picked up as a&#xD;
stable-boy, or in listening to the conversations at the table&#xD;
d'h6te. This blow, with his other troubles, struck him&#xD;
down, and ':amid the jeers of the people generally, he&#xD;
sneaked off at night from Beechland, as Busteed remarked,&#xD;
"to turn up in Texas,-do over again the 'first family&#xD;
humbug,' and look down upon honest people on account&#xD;
of his aristocratic associations."&#xD;
Mr. Moreton was buried near the public road in the&#xD;
graveyard at Beechland; it was contemplated to erect a&#xD;
splendid monument over his grave, and the site alluded to&#xD;
was selected by Col. Lee as the fittest place to display to&#xD;
the passers-by upon the "storied ui~n" the many virtues&#xD;
of the deceased. Soon after the funeral there came on one&#xD;
of those long and continuous rains, so common in the&#xD;
South, and the roads every where were almost impassable&#xD;
-they were so cut up by heavy loads. The negroes,&#xD;
with their jaded teams, in their usual desire to avoid the&#xD;
obstacles~ of the prescribed highway, made a short cut&#xD;
across one corner of the graveyard; and what was first&#xD;
done in the spirit of necessity, soon became a matter of&#xD;
course, and ox-wagons, emigrants, carriages, and foot-pas-&#xD;
sengers pursued, unconscious of profanation, the new-&#xD;
inade~ way. ' the sun&#xD;
Bgt when          shone out again in brightness,-&#xD;
when the heretofore impassable road resumed its wanted&#xD;
hard and dusty firznness,-it was found, that the resting-&#xD;
&#xD;
place of the once noble and gen~rous-hearted Mr. Moreton,&#xD;
was entirely obliterated from the face of the earth.&#xD;
Major Dixon finally carried out his cherished intention&#xD;
of retiring from active participation in his long pursued,&#xD;
and, to him, most probable business. His trip to Goles-&#xD;
burg was his last appearance in his professional capacity.&#xD;
On his return' to New Orleans he sold out hi~ depot, and&#xD;
retiring to a valuable tract of land he had 'long owned in&#xD;
the vicinity of Beechland, he brought together a large&#xD;
number of negroes that he had' hired about the country,&#xD;
and, as if by magic, ~turned into a substantial planter;&#xD;
and, as was agreed by the best judges, owned the "hand-&#xD;
somest force" that could be found in the whole South.&#xD;
As Major Dixon gradually developed hims4f, his&#xD;
equivocal Georgian title of Major, warmed under the in-&#xD;
fluence of popular favor, burst, like a well-perfected bud,&#xD;
into the full-blown luxuriance of "General;" and so quietly&#xD;
had it been done, tha~t no one could remember when the&#xD;
transition took place.&#xD;
"Alava "-for such was the name the General chose&#xD;
for his place-was distinguished for the rich furniture of&#xD;
the residence, as well as for its perfectly trained domes-&#xD;
ties. The arrival, from time to time, at Beechland, of~&#xD;
costly mirrors, damask curtains, rich carpets, cuslAoned&#xD;
chairs,--all bearing the magical mark of "ID," in their&#xD;
final disposition, gave to the reception-rooms an almost&#xD;
unknown splendor. Upon the walls were hung several&#xD;
fine engravings, prominently among which the proprietor&#xD;
of Alava placed "Mercy's Dream;" his own portrait,&#xD;
half-tength, had also bcen painted, which re~)re~e1iteJ the&#xD;

THE MASTER'S iiorsn;&#xD;
&amp;amp;&#xD;
&#xD;
General, sitting in a rn~gnificent library, and holding a&#xD;
"Virgil" in his hand.&#xD;
Parson Goshawk, as he now disliked to be called, soon&#xD;
after he married the widow~Hartshorn, devoted the whole&#xD;
of his time to agricultural pursuits. He had unfortu-&#xD;
nately become affected by a bronchial complaint. His gen-&#xD;
eral health appeared excellent; he had an unfailing appe-&#xD;
tite, and nothing, however great the quantity, that went&#xD;
down his throat, hurt him: talking about cotton, negroes,&#xD;
or, my plantation, did not seem to irritate the epiglottis, but&#xD;
the moment he rose in the pulpit to preach, he said that&#xD;
he felt a wandering of mind,-'--'a vacancy of thought,-a&#xD;
total want of interest in the subject matter before him,-&#xD;
that was truly alarming; and he was, therefore, obliged&#xD;
to leave off public ministrations altogether, and thus having&#xD;
'leisure, he often visited, and became quite a favorite with&#xD;
his neighbor, Gen. Dixon, whose hospitality soon became&#xD;
proverbial.&#xD;
Surrounded with friends, it was seldom indeed that&#xD;
the~ General partook of the solitary meal of a bachelor&#xD;
planter. The return of a birthday was made the occasion&#xD;
of a social gathering. The guests filled the splendid par-&#xD;
lors, and in varied conversation beguiled the time preced-&#xD;
ing the announcement that the feast is prepared. Upon&#xD;
a sideboard was a rich display of cut-glass, a pitcher of&#xD;
ice-water, and several decanters of costly liquors and&#xD;
wines. Generally, a servant stood by to assist those who&#xD;
desired to refresh themselves; if not, the gentlemen, with&#xD;
and without ceremony, gratified their appetites.&#xD;
On one of those pleasant sideboard gatherings, while&#xD;
&#xD;
the gentlemen were trying their wits about the age and&#xD;
value of the costly wines and brandies before them, Mr.&#xD;
Goshawk started up with animation, and said: "Are you&#xD;
aware, gentlemen, that these lovely flowers, in which we&#xD;
are almost empowered, are absolutely the complimentary&#xD;
evidences of the esteem inwhich General Dixon is held by.&#xD;
the ladies of my congregation?"&#xD;
"Pshaw, G-oshawk!" said Dix&amp;amp;n, absolutely blushing&#xD;
to his eyes.&#xD;
"Aha!" said ~udge Burley; "this explains why that&#xD;
white 'lady banks' has been so very carefully disposed&#xD;
of on the centre-table,-.--reposing luxuriantly in a vase&#xD;
by itself: acknowledge the indictment, General ;-.that&#xD;
bud is from old Governor Starbuck's conservatory, now&#xD;
isn't it ?" and the judge looked unusually knowi~ig upon&#xD;
the company present..&#xD;
"The fact is," stammered the Generals still confused-&#xD;
'~ the fact is, the ladies have been very kind indeed, and I&#xD;
am deeply indebted to them."&#xD;
"But you find one thorniess rose among the number,&#xD;
that is especially"worthy of an honored place," pursued&#xD;
the judge, still keeping up his mysterious expression.&#xD;
"Don't be too severe on the General," said Goshawk,&#xD;
coming to his relief, "for you cannot imagine that Alava&#xD;
will always be without a mistress."&#xD;
"A health to the future lady of Alava,~" cried Captain&#xD;
Mercer, moving towards the sideboard; "come, 'gents,'&#xD;
let's fill up." A simultaneous rush was made to the point&#xD;
designated, and the significant gurgling sounds of liquids&#xD;
and the musical tinkling of glasses ensued.&#xD;

receded by a grateful rattling of silver spoons, and&#xD;
other preluding noises from an adjoining room, that so&#xD;
clearly indicate that the last artistic touches are being&#xD;
given to the carefully set table-~-the folding doors were&#xD;
opened, and the hospitable board, and its accessories pre-&#xD;
sented to view.&#xD;
Upon a side table were piled up hundreds of pieces&#xD;
of fine china, beside of which, were ascending from the&#xD;
,?otage jullien, and bis~jue, the most grateful odors.&#xD;
The guests, by a profusion of servants, who moved with&#xD;
quietness and precision) were conducted to their assigned&#xD;
places at the sumptuous board, and with a graceful preli-&#xD;
minary, they unfolded the fine napkins, on which rested the&#xD;
prism-hued crystal, and in their new form, seemed drifted&#xD;
snow, absolutely deceiving the imagination into a sense of&#xD;
giving a cooling influence to the genial atmosphere.&#xD;
Thus were, disposed, the recipients of the hospitality&#xD;
of the prosperous and honored Gen, Dixon, and with smiling&#xD;
faces~ and grateful expectation, they beheld adown the long&#xD;
table, at stated intervals, glistening pyramids of cake, com-&#xD;
bined under the eye of innocence and beauty, from the&#xD;
charmed surfaces of which sprang, in wasteful profusion,&#xD;
sugar-coated ~cloves,~~ and innocent lanibkins enchained&#xD;
in rosy wreaths.&#xD;
Still securing the attention of the eye were the varied&#xD;
preserved fruits of the Western J~adies, lying in their juicy&#xD;
beds, as fresh as if just robbed from their spicy homes,&#xD;
while rich confections and preserves, in luxuriant wanton-&#xD;
ness, filled up the intervening spaces.&#xD;
A choice bouquet of flowers, by their enamelled smiles,&#xD;
&#xD;
designated the allotted place of each guest, while from&#xD;
the centre of all, towered a floral pyramid, in which strug.&#xD;
gled for glowing supremacy the choicest native and ex-&#xD;
otic flowers, making the 'very air redolent with the per-&#xD;
fames of the honey-suckle, the hyacinth, the orange and&#xD;
citron bud,-more beautiful than Ceres or Pomona ever&#xD;
offered to the Queen of Love; and amid all, there went up&#xD;
the appropriate incense of a blessing, from the appointed&#xD;
man of God.&#xD;

THE MASTER'S HOUSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
* # * * *&#xD;
NEvER was there a funeral attended by more sincere&#xD;
mourners, than accompanied the remains of Annie Mild-&#xD;
may to her last resting-place. Among the throng, there&#xD;
was scarcely one who could claim a personal acquaintance,&#xD;
yet Annie was remembered, as she had occasionally ap-&#xD;
peared at church, and all felt that her premature death was&#xD;
hastened by the sad events already recorded. From the&#xD;
moment that she bestowed her last look of affection upon&#xD;
her husband, and raised her last prayer that Heaven would&#xD;
bless him, Graham seemed to be as one stunned beyond&#xD;
recovery. Throughout all the affecting preliminaries,' he&#xD;
passively obeyed the suggestions of Gen. Bledsoe, and&#xD;
submitted, without remark, to whatever was done by the&#xD;
kind-hearted ladies of the neighborhood, who volunteered&#xD;
their attentions by the bed of sickness, and in the chamber&#xD;
of death.&#xD;
The last rites to the beautiful and good were per-&#xD;
'formed in the morning. The grave was in a quiet spot,&#xD;
beneath a wide-spreading oak, whose immense limbs held&#xD;
&#xD;
A TALE OF SOUTHERN LIFE.&#xD;

&#xD;
their delicate leanings, as if they would protect the little&#xD;
hillock from every~ rudO intrusion. Even before the mourn-&#xD;
ers had departed, the innocent birds were caroling in&#xD;
the tree-top, and from a distance, its vernal gloom seemed&#xD;
to promise sweet repose.&#xD;
Graham sat hour after hour upon the now, to him,&#xD;
deserted gallery. His servants moved noiselessly about,&#xD;
and dared not disturb his hopeless sorrow. Toward the&#xD;
close of day, Governor (since the duel more than ever&#xD;
cherished for his faithful service) handed his master a&#xD;
large number of letters and papers, which were listlessly&#xD;
received, and then, unnoticed, cast aside. The sun That&#xD;
had for some moments been struggling upon the horizon,&#xD;
and in flickering gleams illuminated the landscape, now&#xD;
rapidly disappeared; and as there is no twilight in a&#xD;
Southern sky, the thick darkness of a starless night en-&#xD;
shrouded the form of Graham Mildmay.&#xD;
THE END.&#xD;
