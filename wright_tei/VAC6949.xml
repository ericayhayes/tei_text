CHAPTER I.&#xD;
&#xD;
ENTERED, according to Act of Congress, in the Year One Thousand Eight Hundred&#xD;
and Fifty-three, by t. LONG &amp;amp; EROTHER,; in the Ofilce of the Clerk of the&#xD;
District Court oP the United States, for the Southern District of New York.&#xD;

THE STORM    A ND T HE WRECK.&#xD;
"To hear&#xD;
The roaring of the raging elements--&#xD;
To know all human skill, all human strength&#xD;
Avail not ; to look around and only see&#xD;
The mountain wave, incumbent with its weight&#xD;
Of bursting water, o'er the reeling bark-&#xD;
Oh, God ! this is indeed a dreadful thing !"&#xD;
&#xD;
THE mad ambition, the lust of power, and the commercial&#xD;
cupidity of Great Britain, in arrogating to herself the complete&#xD;
dominion of the ocean, and exercising overit a lawless and un-&#xD;
bounded tyranny, had at length in 1811+12, become so insup-&#xD;
portable to the citizens of America, that they came to the deter-&#xD;
mination of resorting to ARMS, in order to compel the "haughty&#xD;
islanders" to recognize with more respect, their position as one&#xD;
of the independent nations of the earth.&#xD;
War was accordingly declared : the bill passing the, Senate&#xD;
on the 18th of June, 1812. A little more than one year after&#xD;
this event had -taken place, the main incidents of our historiette&#xD;
occurred.&#xD;
Those acquainted with the seaboard of the state of Maine,&#xD;
will, coincide with us when we say, that it would be impossible&#xD;

&#xD;
to imagine a more fearful and awe-inspiring sight; than what&#xD;
its rugged and iron bound-line of coast presents, when the&#xD;
winds and the waves-the fires of heaven and its dread artil-&#xD;
lery-meet like opposing armies in one wild, chaotic confusion.&#xD;
Wo ! be unto the ship then driven on that rock-bound coast.&#xD;
Beyond the reach of human aid, she is instantaneously dashed&#xD;
in a thousand pieces among the huge masses of detached rocks,&#xD;
and half-sunken reefs, that extend out to sea in some places for&#xD;
nearly a mile; and over which the waves, when roused into&#xD;
fury at the voice of the storm, break with a force and heights&#xD;
that is truly awful to behold !&#xD;
The night of the 10th of September, 1813, was one that the&#xD;
inhabitants of the Maine coast had cause to remember for&#xD;
years with sorrow and regret; for on that night, many a home&#xD;
was deprived of its " bread winner," many a parent of a child,&#xD;
mkny a child of a parent.&#xD;
On that night, the Spirit of thge Storm, clothed in his most&#xD;
terrific horrors, strode like the devastating Angel of Death, on&#xD;
the face of the waters of the mighty deep. The windows of&#xD;
heaven were loosed in their fury ; the rattling thunders boomed&#xD;
forth peal on peal, until the earth seemed shaken to its very&#xD;
centre ; and the fires of heaven alternately flashing forth with&#xD;
a brilliancy that exhibited the minutest object for miles, and&#xD;
then leaving all in darkness as deep as the grave, lent a sublimity&#xD;
and magnificence to the scene, to which nothing can be likened,&#xD;
than the battle of the seraphs with the legions of hell.&#xD;
On this night, and in the midst of these horrors, a vessel&#xD;
might have been seen, driving at a fearful rate, directly on the&#xD;
rugged shores of Maine ; about equi-distant between Wells and&#xD;
Kennebunk.&#xD;
'er sails were torn to shreds and flapping from their yards;&#xD;
and her rudder having been unshipped, she was thus entirely at&#xD;
the mercy of the winds and waves, which were now hurryingher&#xD;
on to certain destruction ; and ever and anon, as thelightaing&#xD;
illuminated the awful scene with startling distinctness, the crew&#xD;
&#xD;
might have been seen clinging to the shrouds, or lashed to spars,&#xD;
and turning their faces with expectant dread on the fearful spot&#xD;
they were being hurried at such tremendous speed.&#xD;
On, on, she sped, past aid, past hope, and now she is within a&#xD;
few feet of the breakers, which, like an immense wall of seefh.&#xD;
ping foam, stretched along the coast. Nearer-nearer-she&#xD;
enters their vortex. She strikes-again-again-again,&#xD;
God have mercy on the poor mariners.&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
THE IIME AND PARENTS OF OtR HERO.&#xD;
"We will lift the curtains and show you the pictures."-Shakespeare.&#xD;
"JusT at the self-same beat of Time's wide wings," as John&#xD;
Keats hath it-when the event took place, as described at the&#xD;
end of the last chapter-a scene of far different description was&#xD;
being enacted in the large, roomy parlor of a substantial farm-&#xD;
house, standing at the distance of little more than half a mile&#xD;
from the edge of the cliff.T&#xD;
The farm itself-known in the neighborhood as the Elms,  -&#xD;
from the fact of its being surrounded and sheltered from 'the&#xD;
storms of the coast by several of those stately trees-was a&#xD;
large rambling and, indescribable building in its external appear-&#xD;
ance ; but for comfort, cleanliness and hospitality, the interior,&#xD;
and the inmates of Elm Farm, were decidedly second tQ none ;&#xD;
even in those good old days of homely virtues and manners.&#xD;
Farmer Weston, its proprietor and occupant, was, at the date&#xD;
of our tale, a hale old man of sixty ; with a heart, genial as his&#xD;
smile, and a disposition, frank, generous, and--extremely iras-&#xD;
cible ; but, like all easily excited people, his anger was but mo-&#xD;
mentary, as easily calmed as roused.&#xD;
His family consisted of his wife-about ten years his junior,&#xD;
and still retaining on her countenance traces of that superlative&#xD;
beauty which had won for her, during her days of girlhood, the&#xD;
appellation of the-Belle of the Saco-their son, Harry Weston,&#xD;
&#xD;
a gallant youth of nineteen, now midshipman on board the U. S.&#xD;
frigate Mohawk, of 36 guns; and Agnes, a beautiful, young,&#xD;
hazel-eyed, auburn-haired girl of sweet sixteen; as amiable too&#xD;
in disposition, as she was beautiful in form.&#xD;
On the night we introduce them to the reader, the old man&#xD;
sat in his easy chair before a blazing coal fire, enjoying the lux-&#xD;
ury of a comfortable nap; while Dame Weston and Agnes,&#xD;
seated near to a little work-table, were busily employed with&#xD;
their needles; and at every fresh gust, that seemed in its fury&#xD;
about to transport the farm from its "earth-bound ties," would&#xD;
they give an involuntary shudder, and mutter some remark on&#xD;
its fury.&#xD;
"God help the poor sailors on such a night as this !" observed&#xD;
Mrs. Weston, after a heavier blast than usual; "for if he does&#xD;
not help them, all their skill will avail them nothing. I am&#xD;
very glad that Henry wrote to say that they would not sail&#xD;
from Boston until after the 13th; 1 am sure I should have&#xD;
been miserable, had I known he had been out on such a night&#xD;
as this."&#xD;
"I never recollect such an awful night," said Agnes, "al-&#xD;
though I have seen great storms before."&#xD;
"I remember when I was a girl," said her mother, "and about&#xD;
fifteen years old, there was just such another storm as this took&#xD;
place. And oh ! what a frightful sight was it next morning, to&#xD;
see the beach, for miles en both sides of Scarborough, Where I&#xD;
then lived, covered with pieces of wreck and dead bodies, I'm&#xD;
sure I shall never forget it."&#xD;
The door was here slightly opened, and a specimen of the&#xD;
human face divine, carved in ebony, presented itself; at the.&#xD;
same time the lips of the said face .gave utterance to the word&#xD;
" Missus."                                          *&#xD;
"What's the matter, Mark ?" said Mrs. Weston ; "come in&#xD;
and tell us ; don't stand there with the door open ; you let in&#xD;
the cold air."&#xD;
The individual thus addressed entered the apartment ; and&#xD;

&#xD;
presented to the eye, the tall, supple, and well-formed person of&#xD;
a negro, apparently about twenty years old. His name was&#xD;
Marc Antony, but he never got more than Mark.&#xD;
"What is the matter, Mark ?" again repeated the matron&#xD;
when the namesake of Cresar's rival stood before her.&#xD;
"Oh, missus, missus," began Mark ; "dis chile hab seen de&#xD;
orfulest sight as eber was seen!"&#xD;
"You stupid fellow," said his mistress ; "why cannot you&#xD;
tell us at once what you HAVE seen?&#xD;
"As I was cubin from Massa Wilton's," began Marc.&#xD;
"What had you been to Mr. Wilton's for, on such a night&#xD;
as this ?"&#xD;
Cesur 'Gustus inbite me to spen de ebenin', marm," replied&#xD;
Mark.&#xD;
"Now, Mark," said Agnes, looking up from her work, while&#xD;
an arch smile dimpled her rosy mouth, "that will not do; you&#xD;
know it was Blanche Wilton's maid Juliet, whom you went to&#xD;
see ; was it not now&#xD;
"No, Missee Agnes, me 'sure you not," replied Mark, though&#xD;
his confusion belied his words.&#xD;
"Come, Mark," said Mrs. Weston, smiling herself, "never&#xD;
mind this giggling girl; tell me what you saw&#xD;
" Dis chile hab lef de house, marm, and was turning' hone,&#xD;
when de fearfullest flash oh lightning dar eber was seen, 'lumer-&#xD;
nated de hebens like de glory ob de- Lord, and den me seed&#xD;
right amongg de breakers, close ob shore, a great big ship, which&#xD;
de wabes was breaking' ober, orful !,A&#xD;
"What's that ? what's that ?" ejaculated Mr. Weston, sud-&#xD;
"denly awakening from his nap.&#xD;
"Mark says there's a ship just come ashore amongst  the&#xD;
breakers," replied his wife.&#xD;
" Ah ! get me my topcoat then, 1lark---.be quick !" said the&#xD;
old farmer springing to his feet ; "be quick, you black scoun-&#xD;
drel; and then go and rouse Asa up."&#xD;

don't intend going out, do you ?"&#xD;
"I do, though," said the old man, thrusting his"ns  to th&#xD;
coat, which the negro held. "Now, then, Mark, oft' you gO and&#xD;
rouse Asa."&#xD;
Asa Brown was a tall, rough and ready Vermonter, and lived&#xD;
with Mr. Weston as a farm laborer. He was nw, in spite dt&#xD;
the hurly burly outside, snoring " great guns" in his bedronth -&#xD;
and it was only after bing; nearly shaken out of his bed, that&#xD;
he woke sufficiently to exclaim, in a voice something like a pig&#xD;
who has got a cold, when he saw who it was that had refie&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Yew tarnation all-fired sndhbail, what do yea Want ?"&#xD;
"Massa say you hab to get up, and go to sabe a&#xD;
Crew."&#xD;
"I say Mark."&#xD;
" Ees, massa Brown."&#xD;
"Yew hay no pertieler desire tew hey yer nose flattened,&#xD;
hey yer ?"&#xD;
"No, Massa Brown, who flatten urn?"&#xD;
"I will, if yew are not mity slick out o' this ere room."&#xD;
"Massa Weston am waiten for yew to come," urged Mark,&#xD;
edging toward the door, for he knew by experience Asa was&#xD;
not a man to be trifled with.&#xD;
"I calkilate he'll hey tew wait afore I come down," said&#xD;
Asa, drawing his bedclothes about his ears, and commencing&#xD;
his nasal performances as usual.&#xD;
Mark hastened down stairs, and informed his master that Asa&#xD;
would be "fired" before he went.&#xD;
You great, lazy, good for nothing lubber," said old Weston,&#xD;
bursting into his refractory servant's room; "if you're not out&#xD;
of bed in less than two minutes, I'll lay this stick across your&#xD;
shoulders."&#xD;
"Yew wont, really, will yew ?" drawled Asa, who had been&#xD;
awakened by the noise of the old man's entrance.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Wont I though; take that, and see whether I will or not,"&#xD;
shouted the enraged old man, aiming a blow at Asa with his&#xD;
crab-tree stick.&#xD;
As the blow descended, however, Asa suddenly thrust out&#xD;
one of his big fluke-like hands and caught the stick; then jerk-&#xD;
ing it from the old man's hand, he snapt it in two, and quietly&#xD;
dropt the two halves between his bed and the wall.&#xD;
. Old Weston was furious ; but it was of no use-out of bed&#xD;
Asa would not get, neither for threats or anything else; and&#xD;
his master was at last obliged to give up all attempts, and go&#xD;
down stairs.&#xD;
Even had Asa been willing to have gone, they could not&#xD;
have got far ; for the storm had now, if that were possible,&#xD;
increased in intensity ; the .lightnings flashed more vivid and&#xD;
frequent, and the thunder rolled in more startling peals ; and&#xD;
had not the farm been surrounded as it was with the elm trees,&#xD;
which broke the fury of the gusts, it must have suffered&#xD;
severely; as it was, about midnight, one of the chimneys was&#xD;
blown down.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
THE LAST OF THE wRECK.&#xD;
"  ----this gallant which thou seest&#xD;
Was in the wreck ; and but he's something stained&#xD;
With grief, that beauty's canker, thou night'st call him&#xD;
A goodly person : ho hath lost his fellows."-Shakspeare.&#xD;
THE day had scarcely'broke next morning, ere the inmates&#xD;
of Elm Farm were afoot; and the storm having now nearly&#xD;
abated, (though it still blew hard,) Farmer Weston, Asa, and&#xD;
Marc Antony started off to see if there was any survivor's, from&#xD;
the ill-fated vessel, which Mark had seen driven among the&#xD;
breakers.&#xD;
"I cannot say but what you were right, Asa, in refusing to&#xD;
go last night ; we should never have been able to have got fifty&#xD;
rods," said the old man, as the uprooted trees, and blown down&#xD;
fences, gave evidence of the fearful strength of the gale.  t'&#xD;
Guess we wouldn't," was Asa's reply.&#xD;
"Massa, shall dis chile run- to Massa Wilton~s, and Cesai-&#xD;
'Gustus ?" said Mark, as they now -came in sight of a, plain,&#xD;
dark-looking house, that stood in a slight hollow about a quar-&#xD;
ter of a mile from the edge of the cliff.&#xD;
"No," said Mr, Weston, "his master would not let him&#xD;
come ; he dislikes his fellow creatures too much, to attempt in&#xD;
any way to benefit them."&#xD;
The man thus spoken of, was a Markhara Wilton, who, with&#xD;
his neice Blanche, and two servants, resided in the house they&#xD;
&#xD;

were then passing. During the two years he had lived there,&#xD;
he had not been known to speak to one of his neighbors; for&#xD;
when any of them met him-which was not often the case, as&#xD;
he chose unfrequented paths-he invariably passed in sullen&#xD;
silence; nor returned any answer whatsoever to their greeting',&#xD;
of fine morning, or fine evening, sir.&#xD;
At last the simple-minded farmers began to regard him with&#xD;
a species of dread, and whenever the "Silent Man of the Cliff&#xD;
Cottage," as they called him, was descried coming their road,&#xD;
they either stept on one side until he had gone by, or with head&#xD;
averted, passed him at a more rapid pace.,&#xD;
After about ten minutes sharp walking, our trio reached the&#xD;
verge of the cliff; and stood for a minute or two gazing on the&#xD;
beach below. 'The tide had now ebbed quite out, so that the&#xD;
shore lay dry for nearly d quarter of a mile. Not a single yes-&#xD;
tig9 of the ship remained entire, or connected together; but,&#xD;
dashed into a thousand pieces, the wreck was strewn all over&#xD;
The beach.&#xD;
"Gorra mity l" exclaimed Mark; "but de sea am a strong&#xD;
tieg, to abscobolate a ship dat way."&#xD;
" Wal, I guess yew may say that, Snowey, an' no fear o'&#xD;

"You hab, massa Brown."&#xD;
" Jf yew 'trupt me agin, Snowball, I'll squash yer ; tarnation&#xD;
seize me, if I don't."&#xD;
"Come, come," said their master, "no quarrelling ; let us get&#xD;
down on the beach; some poor fellow, perhaps, may have been&#xD;
wslied close under the cliff."&#xD;
They accordingly began to descend the species of pathway,&#xD;
that wound in a zigzag direction down the front of the cliff;&#xD;
and as it was.extremely slippery from the heavy fall of rain, it&#xD;
required no little care on their part, to reach the bottom in&#xD;
safety.&#xD;
At length, however, this was accomplished; and they found&#xD;
he sight even more impressive, than what it had appeared oni&#xD;
&#xD;
the cliff; for independent of t e pieces of wreck strewn aroundj,&#xD;
they beheld the forms of full a dozen of the shipwrecked grew,&#xD;
thrown up close to the cliff; bruised and disfigured, from the&#xD;
sea dashing them among the rocks.&#xD;
"We had better go back, Asa," said old Weston, with a deep&#xD;
sigh of commiseration, "all the poor fellows have gone to their&#xD;
last home ; you and Mark here, can come down after bralj-&#xD;
fast, and dig them a grave, where their own element will sipg&#xD;
a requiem over it."&#xD;
"Why, gawl darn my eyes !" suddenly exclaimed Asa, after&#xD;
they had advanced a little farther along the beach, "hera's&#xD;
Dummy."&#xD;
"Who's Dummy ?" exclaimed Mr. Weston, in surprise.&#xD;
"Why, the chap wot's so soshil with his naybrs-Mis Wil-&#xD;
ton's uncle."&#xD;
"Markham Wilton ?"&#xD;
"Wal, I guess 'til," replied Asa, "and I'll be all-fired if he&#xD;
isn't poorin sumthin' down a man's throat."&#xD;
"Asa," said his master, as they approached, and saw that it&#xD;
was really the reputed misanthrope enacting the part of th&#xD;
good Samaritan, to one of the crew, who evidently yet retained&#xD;
a small spark of the "heavenly flame." " Asa, I am afraid we&#xD;
have all wronged that man with our foul suspicions; you sea.&#xD;
early as we thought "ourselves, he has beat us in the laudable&#xD;
intention of affording succor to any of the crew that migM&#xD;
have been washed ashore."&#xD;
" Wal, now, I shouldn't wonder if.he aint," said Asa; "folks&#xD;
are alus tarnation too fond o' black leddin 'their nayber,&#xD;
wether they hey cause tew Or not."&#xD;
"Good morning, sir," said Mr. Weston, when they hacj ap.&#xD;
proached close to Wilton, engaged in his task of endeavoring&#xD;
to revive the shipwrecked man. "Early as we are, I see we&#xD;
are behind you in good intentions, and what is more, good&#xD;
deeds."&#xD;
The singular being before them gave no reply to this greet-&#xD;

ing, but continued at his task as calmly as though no one was&#xD;
standing by ; and at last his efforts were successful ; for, utter-&#xD;
iug a deep sigh, then a groan, the object of his care at last&#xD;
opened his eyes. The shipwrecked youth was apparently&#xD;
about twenty years old ; slightly built, but possessing a physi-&#xD;
ognomy, which, despite the deathlike palor now spread over&#xD;
it, was still decidedly handsome. He had a brilliant set of&#xD;
teeth ; and when he at length opened his eyes, their dark,&#xD;
eagle-like glance, denoted the presence of a soul of more than&#xD;
common mould. When he had recovered so far as to breathe&#xD;
freely, his taciturn preserver quietly arose from his knees, and&#xD;
without so much as bowing or speaking to Farmer Weston,&#xD;
walked away.&#xD;
"I'll be darned," said Asa, "if I don't reckon that crittur a&#xD;
little cracked in his upper works."&#xD;
"He is a most singular being, to be sure," said Mr. Weston ;&#xD;
"but now about this poor young fellow here ; how is he to be&#xD;
got home? I wish we had brought a handbarrow with us."&#xD;
"Don't worry about gittin him home," said Asa. "I guess&#xD;
we'll easily get out o' that fix; here, Snowball, take hold of his.&#xD;
legs and lift him on my shoulders."&#xD;
"Massa Brown, what for you call me Snowball? Me say&#xD;
massa to you ; cibility should hab cibility."-&#xD;
Yew tarnation, all-fired looking son of the devil's gran'-&#xD;
mother, if yew dont jest shet up, and dew as I 'tell yew, I'll&#xD;
make that head o' yourn so you'll not know it again."&#xD;
The namesake of the illustrious Roman, stood in too much&#xD;
bodily fear of Asa, to stand out after a threat like this; so qui-&#xD;
etly taking hold of the youth's legs, he raised him on the broad&#xD;
burly shoulders of Asa; and the trio started once more on their&#xD;
return to the farm.&#xD;

pleasing as it falls on the ear on a calm, still night; then sweep.&#xD;
ing down again, it careened away over the face of the waves,&#xD;
breaking their mirror-like expanse into countless fragments of&#xD;
scintillating and flashing brilliancy. The two officers in com-&#xD;
mand of the forward watch, were pacing the deck on opposite&#xD;
sides; and without any interchange of that social chat, or&#xD;
yarn-spinning, with which sailors usually endeavor to rob the&#xD;
watches of-their tediousness. The one on the starboard side,&#xD;
was a tall, fine, manly-lookingtyouth,, dressed in the neat uni-&#xD;
form of a Middy; while his companion on the larboard side&#xD;
sported the swabs of a third Luff.&#xD;
They had been .pacing ;thus for above ;tree hours, when&#xD;
suddenly the lieutenant stopped in his walk, and, after pausing&#xD;
a minute or two, in seeming agitation, at last crossed over to&#xD;
his companion, and said, at the same time eitnding his hand-&#xD;
"Mr. Weston, I don't see why you and I cannotrbe friends&#xD;
again: my offence, surely, was not so heinous as to be past&#xD;
forgiveness."&#xD;
"Do you call an attempt on a sister's honor," said, the mid-&#xD;
shipman, indignantly facing the speaker, "anoffence easy to&#xD;
be forgotten? If you think SQ; you will eind yourself n aken.&#xD;
Had we not sailed in the hurry we did, I hould; haye sought&#xD;

suppressed passion, " you; shall :pay {fothisand earlyl, toQ,;&#xD;

"I fearyour threats as little as! wish for your, company,"&#xD;

Shortly after this, 'eight bells struck, and the watch ieloW&#xD;
hastenied on denk to relieve their comrades. For 'few minutes&#xD;
aftertheirappearance,ill was'bistle and excitement; for the&#xD;
first lieutenantwho had now cote on deck, had ordered the&#xD;
cours 6f then ship t be chalinged, and the last watch had there-&#xD;
fore to stop, and assist in the task'of shifting the sails.&#xD;
At length this was accomplished; and the M vitch hurried&#xD;
away to their himknbbks, to get what quantity they culd of&#xD;
that mast tiecarious of all objects to a sailor-sleep.&#xD;
As midshipmart Weston was paying aft on'the starboard&#xD;
side of the'ship, he heard a voice near him saf-&#xD;
"Now nind, Jack, ,not until they're within a mile Or so."'&#xD;
"Ay, ay, sir," was the answer, in gruff tones; "Pll make&#xD;
all right, never fear."&#xD;
Turning miuild, Weston saw that it was the third luff, who&#xD;
was addressing one 'of the watch just going aloft. They did&#xD;
not see our hero, however, as he stood within the shadow of&#xD;
the diainiast.'&#xD;
For some time after retiring to his cot,'those words so haunti&#xD;
edthe mind of our middy, that he could not sleep. Hb apelled&#xD;
them in all  manner of ways; and to all rraine f of objects,&#xD;
but could come to no satisfactory conclusion's to their nean-&#xD;

features,;he saw it was the same man whom, eieu t  qwn&#xD;
had addressed the words to, that had pzed him .so. much.&#xD;
Instantly they flashed can his mind i ; their true light-tiere&#xD;
was treachery at work ! .&#xD;
Hastening'aft, he gained as nigh a positi~  as he could to.&#xD;
the ladder lpsding to the deck--on:the steps of yWhich the fQre-&#xD;
top-rman ,(who was one they had engaged the yery day they&#xD;
left Boston,) was nw standing. A few feet .from him, and&#xD;
sitting on the breech of one of the= starboardsguns, was Lieu-&#xD;
tenant Broom.,..&#xD;
" You infernal sleepy-headed lubber !" exclaimed Captain&#xD;
1haply, approaching the ladder-" why the  pil didn't'you&#xD;
report those ships before they were so near ?"   7&#xD;
," I hope, sir, you'll forgive me for being so careless," said&#xD;
the fellow, in a submissive tone, " but last night I kept watch&#xD;
for. Jqe Tomkins,. who. fell sick ; and that made .me sleepy to-&#xD;
night, sir"&#xD;
H arry Weston stopped , to hear no more ; but, stepping for-&#xD;
ward, he exclaimed-&#xD;
,Captain Manly, I am sorry to say it, but it i my opinion&#xD;
we have traitors on board ! Just as I was eatingg ig deck,&#xD;
after eight bells had struck, I heard Lieutenant room, there,&#xD;
say to this man, as he was about to proceed alQft-. Jack, don't&#xD;
report them until within a mile nor so.' I could; not make out&#xD;
the meaning of the expression then, but in my opinion it is quite&#xD;
apparent now."&#xD;
"It's a lie !L-a d--d infernal lie.!" shouted Broom, his eyes&#xD;
Idashing fire, ad his face pale with fear and rage, at his villany&#xD;
being discovered..&#xD;
In another niomentt the traitor was laid sprawling upon the&#xD;

she was no dashiing thi-dugh The waters at  rate  that sent&#xD;

his speaking-trumpet to his lips, to give the orders to fire, when&#xD;
twe small columns of smoke were seen to issue from the bows&#xD;
of eachof the corvettes; and, at the same moment, two thirty-&#xD;
two-pound balls came whistling through the air--one burying&#xD;
itself deep in the mizzenmast just below the top, while the other,&#xD;
after knocking the trumpet from the hands of the captain,&#xD;
paused between the mizzes shrouds, without doing any damage&#xD;
at ally&#xD;
r Warm work, that !" exclaimed Captain Manly, laughing,&#xD;
as he threw the mouth-piece of his trumpet overboard : "those&#xD;
two chaps show pluck, Monroe !"&#xD;
"They do, sir," answered the lieutenant : "had we not better&#xD;
luffiup,. and silencee, them? I think we could do it before the&#xD;
other two were nigh enough to interfere."&#xD;
"I think we could," said the captain, ' we will try it, how-&#xD;
ever."&#xD;
The yards of the Mohawk were accordingly braced back;&#xD;
her bows hove round ; and, as she-luffed-up and obtained a&#xD;
raking position athwart the bows of:the two corvettes-who&#xD;
were running but, a short distance from each, other, and nearly&#xD;
parallel--every gun in her starboard battery was discharged&#xD;
into them.&#xD;
For some minutes after this murderousbroadside, the smoke&#xD;
was so dense, that the effects of it could note seen ; but when&#xD;
the breeze rolled off the obscuring mass of vapor, the corvettes&#xD;
were seen foul of each other, with all their upper spars and&#xD;
:sails hanging about them ,in, inextricable confusion. Three&#xD;
loud and, hearty huzzas burst from the crew of the Mohawk,&#xD;
as this spectacle met their eyes ; and, had it not been for the&#xD;
nigh approach of the frigate-their consort-Captain Manly&#xD;
might have wore ship, run down, and taken possession of them&#xD;
at once ; but,, as this could, not be done}without risking the loss&#xD;
of his own vessel, he wisely refrained. It now, began to be&#xD;
apparent? that an enemy whose ensign was neither that of the&#xD;
&#xD;
23&#xD;
&#xD;
stars and stripes, nor the blood-red cross of St. George, was&#xD;
about to enter on the scene. This wa, a storm.&#xD;
The heavens had been gradually darkening the last quarter&#xD;
of an hour, and the wind increasing in intensity; while the&#xD;
waves, losing their long rolling, billow-like motion, now broke&#xD;
into foam at every few yards.&#xD;
All the light sails were immediately taken in, the halliards&#xD;
let go, and the reef-tackles;hauled chock-a-block; and, nimble&#xD;
as monkeys, "best man up first,' away aloft hurried the tars,&#xD;
to take in the reefs. This being done, they descended, and&#xD;
resumed their posts ; while their gallant little craft under close-&#xD;
reefed topsails,. spanker, and jib, dashed through the yeasty&#xD;
waves like a mad thing.&#xD;

WE left the Mohawk rattling along under reefed topsails, and&#xD;
plunging her bows every now and then under water, as though -&#xD;
about to explore the wonders of the deep. This she continued&#xD;
to do until about four bells; when the wind suddenly chopped&#xD;
round to the north, and commenced blowing "great guns" in&#xD;
earnest.&#xD;
All the sails were now taken in, save close-reefed fore and&#xD;
main topsails, to keep her steady; and under those. two sails&#xD;
only she scudded along at the rate of twelve knots.&#xD;
All traces of the seventy-four and the frigate had now been&#xD;
lost sight of for above three hours ; Captain Manly there-&#xD;
fore congratulated himself on his providential escape ; and&#xD;
felt a species of gratitude to the storm, for its opportune ap&#xD;
pearance.&#xD;
About noon, land was seen on the lee bow; apparently at&#xD;
the distance of about two miles. It was concluded to be Cape&#xD;

"Aye,; aye, sir," shouted: the men, springing from the. main-&#xD;
chains, and laying aloft to-execute the order; and it  was the&#xD;
last onethey ever did execute fdr an earthly commander; for&#xD;
the whole'volume-of the sail was no: sooner. displayed to the&#xD;
blast, than a sharp, splitting: sound was, heard, and then crack&#xD;
went the topmast close by the cap head;. and the five or six&#xD;
poor fellows who hadrgone aloft to take the reefs'out of the top-&#xD;
sail, where hurled far away clear of the ship, beyond all reach&#xD;
of aid, where they sank to rise bno more, beneath the furious.&#xD;
Waves.&#xD;
Theship was now in a fearful position; for the. breakers&#xD;
were' not twenty'yards from her bow ; destruction seemed inev-&#xD;
itable, and 'nothing, little short of a miracle, could save them.&#xD;
It was a moment to try the nerves of anyeoginmander; lut&#xD;
Captain Manly was equal to it ; ,his. coolness;never for a single&#xD;
moment deserted him ; but calmly, clearly, and distinctly, as&#xD;
though working the ship into port, did he stand on the' quarter&#xD;
deck, and issue forth 'his orders..&#xD;
" Stand by there, men," he suddenly shouted in his[trumpet-&#xD;
like voice; "stand by there to cut away the{masts; and see&#xD;
the two hawsers; and best bower cleared for dropping,; if they'll&#xD;
held, we may ride it-out yet.' :     :  .=.&#xD;
Luckily, this scheme, at the moment it was going to be put&#xD;
into 'effect, was rendered abortive by an almost miraculous&#xD;
event ; this was no other than a gigantic 'and mountainous&#xD;
wave, which, striking the ship near lthe- stern sheets, hurled her&#xD;
cOmpletely.clear of the low reef on which she was, hurrying_;&#xD;
so near, however, was she unto it, that a biscuits might with&#xD;
ease have been pitched upon it. IE a few minutes; more she&#xD;
had passed the dangerous ledge, and was'ag in indeep water.&#xD;
The gale had now evidently spent its fury;, and though the&#xD;
sea wasstill fearfully high,. and the breeze .anything :hut a&#xD;
zephyr,.it was plainly apparent tO all now, that their chances&#xD;
of visiting the "coral halls" of David Jones; Esq., this cruise,&#xD;
were decidedly lessened.&#xD;

AlUhands!were. now busily employe 'in clearing;away the&#xD;
wreck offthe topmast, rigging ,ip a jury one,.pumping out the&#xD;
water she had .shipped, and refastening the spars, asks, and&#xD;
deck guns, that hadheen washed loos during}the gale.&#xD;
"Sail-ho !", sung, out the look-out fprward.&#xD;
' Where away ?',fr;&#xD;
"Three points.on the weather-hea, sir; she is little more&#xD;
than a mile from us.                          "&#xD;
" What does she showv like ?" demanded Captain Manly.&#xD;
'A large; frigate, or seventy-fogr, sir," was the answer.&#xD;
"She is bearig down upon us under a heavy press of canvas."&#xD;
Owing to the crippled state of the' Mohawk, their chances&#xD;
of escaping their formidable opponent were anything but flat-&#xD;
tering; but it was not in the nature of YANKEE TARS to give&#xD;
up while there was hope.&#xD;
All the sails that could be were now hoisted on board the&#xD;
Mohawk, and her bows turned directly on to the Mame coast;&#xD;
her commander determining, if possible, to run her ashore and&#xD;
blow her up, sooner than that she should fall 'into the hands of&#xD;
John Bull. As ,the land was only about three-quarters of a&#xD;
mile distant' thisproject seemed feasible enough.&#xD;
The Englishman had now hoisted his colors, and was fast&#xD;
lessening the distance between hin and his intended prize and&#xD;
having opened a heavy fire. from his bow chasers, was begin-&#xD;
ning to make terrible havoc among the spars and rigging of the&#xD;
Mohawkth                     pt                g&#xD;
Captain Manly would fam have played a game at long bowls&#xD;
with his enemy, but he was afraid if he did so, it would impede&#xD;
the speed of his ship so much, as to materially endanger their&#xD;
chance of escape.t.&#xD;
A thirty-two pound ball now struck the mizzen boomof the&#xD;
Mohawk, causing her to yaw so much, that she presented her&#xD;
full broadside to the seventy-four; a circumstance that no&#xD;
sooner took place,:than playing his trumpet:to his mouth, Cap-&#xD;

CHAPTER VI..&#xD;
THE INvALID---THE LovERS--THE SURPRISE.&#xD;
"He is the deuce among the girls."&#xD;
Al eet Pic,.&#xD;
&#xD;
TIlE locale of tour narrative now once more shifts to Elm&#xD;
Farw, the residence of Farmer Weston ; and where the scene&#xD;
of our introductory chapters were laid ; and the time, the{third&#xD;
afternoon after the crew of the Mohawk had escaped in their&#xD;
boats frmn the ,English seventy-four          i&#xD;
P previous; to groceeding, however, with the further develop-&#xD;
ment of our plot, we shall have to retrograde a few steps, in&#xD;
order to explain one or two events that have taken place, since&#xD;
we last visited the farm.&#xD;
On reaching home with the sole survivor of the wreck, it had&#xD;
been discovered that his left shoulder was dislocated ; while the&#xD;
numerous other bruises which he had sustained, by being&#xD;
dashed about among the rocks, caused him to remain in bed for&#xD;
nearly a week, for it was a matter of the most excruciating pain&#xD;
to him to be moved in the least. If assiduous and unremitting&#xD;
attention to his every want, or the most careful nursing, could&#xD;
have restored him to health, he would not have remained long&#xD;
on a bed of sickness; for dame Weston had not had a job so&#xD;
congenial to her tastes, or one that afforded her so much satis-&#xD;
faction, "never (as she observed herself,) since she was a girl&#xD;
about fifteen," when her brother was brought home one day&#xD;
with a broken arm.,&#xD;

i&#xD;
&#xD;
THE YANKEE MIDDY; OR&#xD;

30&#xD;
&#xD;
31&#xD;
&#xD;
But, as assiduous as she was in her. attention on the invalid,&#xD;
there were two others who not only rivalled her in this respect,'&#xD;
but exceeded her.  These 'were her{ daughter Agnes, and&#xD;
Blanche Wilton, the friend and almost inseparable companion&#xD;
of Agnes, and neice of" the Silent Man of Cliff'Cottage."&#xD;
The daintiest of tarts and custards, and the choicest ofÂ£fruits,&#xD;
did Agnes and Blanche shower with lavish profusion on the&#xD;
object of their common solicitude. And it is a matter of doubt&#xD;
that, had not the invalid been able to rise from ;his couch in&#xD;
about a week after his arrival, he would' have stood a good&#xD;
chance of actually having been "killed by kindness."&#xD;
Oh, Love,.Eos! Cupid ! or whatever else thy names may be&#xD;
-ever since thou, with thy little flame-tipped darts, caused a&#xD;
city to have to sustain a ten year's siege, and finally be burnt,&#xD;
(we will not endanger our character for veracity by ascending&#xD;
higher on the ladder of antiquity,) what dissension and misery&#xD;
hath thou caused among the sons and daughters of Adam.&#xD;
Why is it co?  What' right hast thou, thou little, breechless,&#xD;
bandylegged scoundrel-what right hast thou, we ask agin, to&#xD;
do so . Thou hadst much better' get thyself a decent suit of&#xD;
clothes, and go to some opthalmium and endeavor to have thy&#xD;
sighi restored, than to go prowling about the world thus,  seek-&#xD;
ing whom thou mayst annoy. What- cause Was there for thee&#xD;
to be meddling with the hearts of two damsels who, up to the&#xD;
moment of thy making them aware of the fact, scarcely knew&#xD;
they possessed such a thing as a heart ?&#xD;
But now that thou hast, with thy dissension sowing power,&#xD;
entered on the scene, all the endearing ties of friendship, and&#xD;
the gentle and open-hearted confidence ef'youth, mUst  give&#xD;
place to the fearful torments of jealousy, mistrust, and rivalry.&#xD;
Yes, reader, it was even so. Agnes Weston and' Blanche Wil-&#xD;
ton, to whom Shakspeare's exquisite description of female friend-&#xD;
ship in the "Midsummer's Night Dream," might but a few days&#xD;
ago have been justly applied, were now rivals; and the 'man&#xD;
who had thus inspired both their hearts with the tumultuous&#xD;

feelings of love, was the youth who had been so singularly res.&#xD;
cued from a watery grave.         ;&#xD;
,Marston Spener-for by this name.had le called himself--&#xD;
was:not:only possessed.of a most pleasing exterior, nd. aspril.&#xD;
liant a pair of large, dark, lustrous eyes, as ever flashed forth&#xD;
the impassioned language of love ; but her had that vIginning ad-&#xD;
diess, that seeming'e arzestness of devotion, and ever self-sacri-&#xD;
fibing manner of gallantry, which are so irresistibly a tractive&#xD;
in man, when allied with brilliant and, fascinating conversa-&#xD;
tional talents. - How is it likely, then, that two young, warm-&#xD;
hearted maidens, like Agnes and Blanche,&#xD;
unacquainted with the world,"anall Its hollowness,"&#xD;
should be ableto escape " the square of the flatterer."  w&#xD;
Hisserpent-like tongue aided his guilty. projects but too well;&#xD;
,and though each of the maidens was aware that he had breath-&#xD;
ed the words of love to her rival-when Agnes, with tears in&#xD;
her'eyes, accused him of the fact, he, had. solemnly assured&#xD;
her on his honor, they were only the most hairmnless, words of&#xD;
gallantry he had addressed her with.; but however,'as he saw&#xD;
it gave his dear Agnes pain, he wouldtake care not to repeat&#xD;
them. The' same. answer, with the name altered, did, when&#xD;
Blanche also accused him of loving Agnes hetty tha her.&#xD;
This explanation, made, we, will now oiee mor resume the&#xD;
thread of our narrative.,&#xD;
It was the afternoon, as we have said, of the third day after&#xD;
the blowing up of the Mohawk; the day was warm and sunny,&#xD;
and scarce a breath of air.stirred the.;leaves of the lofty elms&#xD;
bending beneath. the weight of their thick, umbrageous foliage.&#xD;
In a small summer-house, standing at the lower end of the&#xD;
garden, attached to the rear of the house occupied by Mark-&#xD;
harn Sinclair, the:Recluse, and which was nearly buried be-&#xD;
neath a profusion of the clustering leaves, and star-like flowers&#xD;
of the jasmine, ;the climbing clemati, .aid. the beautiful little&#xD;

T HE .TWO FRIGATEs. -'&#xD;
and, gentleman; both young, both handsome,&#xD;
Wilton and Marton Spencer.&#xD;
Blanche was very beautiful; and her form,&#xD;
grace and proportions, seemed more like one of&#xD;
" All lightness, life, and glee,&#xD;
One of theashapesawe seem&#xD;
To meet in visions of the night,"-&#xD;
than that of a real, blushing, merry-hearted* little&#xD;
Her eyes were so brilliant, and changeable in&#xD;
while at one- moment you would have declare&#xD;
jetty black, at the next you would have sworn&#xD;
then dark blue1 then brown; for, as the calm&#xD;
lonely mountain reflects from its surface the v&#xD;
passing over it, so did her ees reflect, in their&#xD;
the different emotions of her volatile nature: he&#xD;
curling, and luxuriant; and of that light auburn,&#xD;
color, which Correggio was so fond of adorning&#xD;
and female saints with: her rosy mouth, and d&#xD;
lips, were provokingly small and sweet, and.woul&#xD;
even a St. Anthony with a desire for a close&#xD;
But, with all these lovable qualities, Blanche&#xD;
V                                                                     one very un-lovable one-she was a slight jilt.&#xD;
Previous to Henry Weston's leaving home&#xD;
his naval career as midshipman, Blanche and h&#xD;
the Vulgate hath it, "sweethearts ;" but, while&#xD;
was merely the ephemeral and upper surface&#xD;
which only retains its intensity and strength d&#xD;
ence of the object exciting it--on. nrs part, yo&#xD;

me it seems nothing less than the hand of Fate, who, having&#xD;
designed thee, dear Blanche, to be my fellow-voyager through&#xD;
life, took this manner to bring us together: dost not think so,&#xD;
love ?"&#xD;
Blanche was silent; but her heightened color, heaving bosom,&#xD;
and a timid and furtive glance, which she cast from her large&#xD;
eyes, swimming with love and tenderness, expressed anything&#xD;
rather than dissent from his proposition.&#xD;
"Say, dearest," said Marston, pressing her hand to his lips,&#xD;
and fixing his eyes with a steadfast and imploring glance upon&#xD;
her-" does it not seem so&#xD;
Faint and sweet as the soft sighing of a zephyr over a bed&#xD;
of violets, came the one , word, "Yes," from her scarcely&#xD;
parted lips;. and in another moment she was clasped warmly&#xD;
to the breast of the man, who that morning had breathed,&#xD;
nearly word for word, the same sentence to the ears of Agnes&#xD;
Weston.&#xD;
"And you love me better than all ?" murmured Marston into&#xD;
the ear of Blanche, as she lay in his arms; "and should I for&#xD;
a short time leave this neighborhood, you will still continue to&#xD;
do so, will you, my dearest Blanche ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Marston, I will," said Blanche; "but do not speak&#xD;
of going yet; your arm is surely not quite well."&#xD;
"But the Westons may be getting tired of me, love ?" said&#xD;
Marston.&#xD;
"Nay, do not say that," answered Blanche ; "I am sure, if&#xD;
you were to stop for a year, Farmer Weston would treat you&#xD;
as well, and think as little of it, as though you only stayed a&#xD;
day or two."&#xD;
"But you know, love," said the artful villain, "there is a&#xD;
refused and disappointed daughter in the house, who may not&#xD;
think thus."&#xD;
- "Do not mention HER, the pert minx," exclaimed Blanche,&#xD;
tartly.&#xD;
"She told me, one day," said Marston, fixing his eyes with&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
a basilisk-like glance on the face of Blanche, "that you were&#xD;
deeply in love with her brother, now at sea. It is not true,&#xD;
is it, love ?"&#xD;
Dear Marston," exclaimed Blanche, reproachfully, "you&#xD;
do me injustice to think so. I love none but you-indeed I&#xD;
do not. I never loved Henry Weston; we were only friendly&#xD;
together, as neighbors should be--"&#xD;
Blanche suddenly stopped, uttered a loud and piercing scream,&#xD;
and sank faintingly in the arms of her companion !&#xD;
Henry Weston, with a pale and sorrowful countenance,&#xD;
stood gazing in at the summer-house door !&#xD;

&#xD;
"To dream of joy, and wake to sorrow,&#xD;
Is doom'd to all who love and live ;&#xD;
And if, when conscious on the morrow,&#xD;
We scarce our fancy can forgive,&#xD;
That cheated us in slumber, only&#xD;
To leave the waking soul more lonely,&#xD;
What must they feel, whom no false vision,&#xD;
But truest, tenderest passions warm'd ?&#xD;
Sincere, but swift in sad transition,&#xD;
As if a dream alone had charm'd?&#xD;
Ah ! sure such grief is fancy's scheming,&#xD;
And all thy change can be but dreaming !"-Byron.&#xD;
AFTER the blowing up of their ship, the crew of the Mohawk,&#xD;
by keeping close in with the shore, (and so out of shot-range&#xD;
of the heavy-draughted seventy-four,) were enabled, at length,&#xD;
to reach the mouth of the Piscataqua, and land at Portsmouth;&#xD;
for when blown up, the Mohawk was only about three miles to&#xD;
the north of that port.&#xD;
On landing, the crew were dismissed, with orders to hold&#xD;
themselves in readiness to be drafted in a few days into other&#xD;
ships' companies; and among the rest, our hero. As the time,&#xD;
however, when they should be wanted, was quite uncertain,&#xD;
and Portsmouth not being such a very great distance from his'&#xD;
home, Harry determined on paying the old Elm-Tree a visit;&#xD;
and, hearing that a small coaster was just on the point of start-&#xD;
ing for Wells, he engaged a passage aboard of her, and on the&#xD;
forenoon after their leaving Portsmouth, arrived safely at Wells&#xD;

As Elm Farm was only some five or six miles distance from&#xD;
the last-mentioned place, our hero, as soon as he' stepped on&#xD;
shore, started at once, and on foot, for his home.&#xD;
On coming withinsight of Cliff Cottage=-the residence of&#xD;
the recluse and his beautiful neice-Harry, with the excusable&#xD;
impatience of a lover, determined on giving Blanche an'agree-&#xD;
able surprise; as he knew that she then supposed him far away,&#xD;
"on the deep, deep sea," battling with the enemies of his coun-&#xD;
try. Leaving the main road then, he hastened along a small&#xD;
footpath that led direct. to the cottage; and, as he walked very&#xD;
fast, it was not long 'before he arrived there, 'To make the&#xD;
surprise more certain, he went around to the kitchen door.&#xD;
When he entered, Juliet-a good-looking young negress-&#xD;
was scouring away at.some, of her culinary utensils, and light-&#xD;
ening her labors with strains of questionable harmony, she did&#xD;
not hear our hero's entrance; but, when on 'raising her head,&#xD;
she beheld him standing before her, she uttered a loud'screani,&#xD;
an4 shrank, cowering, into'a corner, and sinking on her knees,&#xD;
continued to half groan, half scream-&#xD;
" De Lor' hab :massy 'pon us !--de mighty Lo? habnassy&#xD;

"What is the matter, Juliet ?" exclaimed Harry, in surprise,&#xD;
approaching her; but the .nearer he eamej'the louder Joliet&#xD;
screamed ;: calling out at :the top of her voice, for " de good&#xD;
Lor' to hab massy 'pon herr-'de:good Lor' to sabe her!"&#xD;
"Juliet, have you gone.mad,. or what the deuce is to do with&#xD;

arm.&#xD;
Juliet stopped screaming directly.&#xD;
"De Lor' be praised !--de mighty Lor' be praised !" she&#xD;
exclaimed, with an emphatic fervency that left not the shadow&#xD;
of a doubt as to its genuineiless, "you is no:ghost at all, den ?"&#xD;
"Ghost, you foolish wench! what made you think I was a&#xD;
ghost ?" asked Harry, in surprise.&#xD;

any noise, as you did, I 'eluded 'twas your ghost:'but de mighty&#xD;
Lor' be praised, you am not your ghost !"&#xD;
"Where is your mistress, Juliet ?" asked tHarry, now that&#xD;
the ghost was laid; "I want to give her a surprise," and his&#xD;
eyes glistened with anticipative pleasure.&#xD;
"I b'lieve, Massa Wesson, dat Missee Blanche is in de sUm-&#xD;
mer-house, but dere is--.-de Lor' sabe us!. he's off like a&#xD;
shot !" exclaimed Juliet, as, without stopping to hear the con-&#xD;
clusion of her speech, Harry now sprang out of the kitchen.&#xD;
Of the "agreeable" surprise he occasioned Blanche, the&#xD;
reader is already aware; and we will merely add, that, after&#xD;
gazing a minute or two, "more in sorrow than in anger," on&#xD;
his faithless ladye-love, he turned on his heel, and abruptly&#xD;
left the spot.&#xD;
On Blanche Wilton's recovering her consciousness, she&#xD;
gazed about her for some time, with a strange, wild, and un-&#xD;
settled look ;,then, while a convulsive shudder ran through&#xD;
her whole frame, she exclaimed, in a hoarse, hollow species of&#xD;
whisper, and as though communing with her own thoughts-&#xD;
"Gone! it must have been fancy ; yet there, methinks, he&#xD;
stood, gazing upon me, with a pale, sad, reproachful look."&#xD;
"Who was that man, dear Blanche, who looked in at the&#xD;
door, and then went away ?" asked Marston; though he had&#xD;
made a shrewd guess in his own mind, wno he was.&#xD;
"Did you see him ?" gasped'Blanche.&#xD;
"I could not miss doing so, without I had been blind," an.&#xD;
swered Marston.&#xD;
"Then it was no spirit, but his real self," exclaimed Blanche,&#xD;
breathing more freely.&#xD;
"No spirit could make such marks with its heels as these,"&#xD;
said Marston, pointing to Harry's foot-prints in the garden&#xD;
walk ; "but who was it, dear Blanche? It has made your&#xD;
cheeks quite symbolical of your name, and your whole frame&#xD;
to quiver like an aspen."&#xD;

with an averted head, at the same time rising from her seat,&#xD;
to leave the summer-house.&#xD;
They sauntered slowly up the gravel walk, and were just&#xD;
on the point of entering the house, when the door leading into&#xD;
the garden was opened, and Markham Sinclair, the Recluse,&#xD;
came forth. No sooner did his eye rest on the companion of&#xD;
Blanche, than he suddenly came to a halt; and, for nearly a&#xD;
minute, gazed upon him with a look in which it would be hard&#xD;
to say, whether surprise or horror preponderated most. Then,&#xD;
uttering a loud, piercing cry, as ihough wrung from him by&#xD;
the intensest agony, he fled wildly into the house, leaving his&#xD;
neice and Spencer rooted to the ground in surprise.&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
WHO IS HE? THE BROTHER AND SISTER.&#xD;
ON the evening ef the second day after Harry Weston's&#xD;
arrival at the "Old House at Home," he, in company with&#xD;
our old acquaintances, Asa Brown and Marc Antony, was&#xD;
enjoying the luxury of a whiff of the "weed," in the large&#xD;
back kitchen of the farm.&#xD;
Harry enjoyed, with great gusto, the conversation of'his&#xD;
two companions; and very often, for the sake of a little sport,&#xD;
set them at loggerheads with each other-never suffering them&#xD;
to proceed to extremities, however ; and, as for them, it would&#xD;
have been a dangerous matter to have breathed a syllable&#xD;
against "Massa Henry," in THEIR hearing, for he was em-&#xD;
phatically "the god of their idolatry," and was looked upon&#xD;
by them as being a second Decatur.&#xD;
They had been puffing .away in silence for some time, and&#xD;
raising such vast volumes of smoke, that they were completely&#xD;
invisible to each other ; and when Harry at length took the&#xD;
pipe from his mouth to address Asa, his voice resembled that&#xD;
of a Delphian priest issuing from the Clouds of insense envelop-&#xD;
ing the shrine of the goddess.&#xD;
"And you cannot recollect the name of the vessel at all,&#xD;
Asa ?" said Harry.&#xD;
"Blame me, if I can," answered Asa, emitting forth a puff&#xD;
of smoke nearly as large as that of a good-sized steam-engine;&#xD;
"it was such an all-fired, tarnation, outlandish name, that I'l'&#xD;

K&#xD;

be darned if I:can rikolect it; guess 'twas sumthin' about&#xD;
Try-on, tho'."&#xD;
"Was it the Triton ?" suggested Harry.&#xD;
" No, it warn't that," said Asa ; "there was sumthin' afore&#xD;
Try-on, but lick me if '1 can think-on't."&#xD;
Massa Brown," said Marc Antony, "you hab got a button,&#xD;
youfknow, wid de name on."&#xD;
Why, gawl darn rny inmortal eyes, if I tint ! wal, now&#xD;
that is strange-all-fire me, if its aidt-to forgit that ! Snow=&#xD;
ball, the next time 1mi:going tew fell yew, jest remind me of&#xD;
this, and I'll not."&#xD;
"Ees, Massa Briwn; 'menot forget DAT."&#xD;
There, Henry;" said Asa,'as:he handed him a small button,&#xD;
"that's it; I pulled'it'off the jacketof one of the poot fellows&#xD;
that we buried, carter bringing this all-fited skunk; -Spender,&#xD;
here, when he oughter have been laid with them."F&#xD;
The button wasÂ° one of these round,brass ones, with which&#xD;
the jacket sleeve-cuffs of the'sailors of the British navy were&#xD;
then wont to be plentifully.'decotated. Within a neatiyaraised&#xD;
border, it bore the worded, "W iB.M. S: Amphitryton.&#xD;
"The.A'mphitryton!" ',exlaimedj Harry, when he had read&#xD;
the inscription ; "why, she was a frigate belonging'to the very&#xD;
squadron, from which we had such anarrow escape.' They&#xD;
have- been cruising between' Capes Cod and Sable, for nearly&#xD;
two months. But why the devil did this Marston Spenoeor&#xD;
ashe calls himself, say itwas the-Dart, India'mat, that he Was&#xD;
wrecked in ?"&#xD;
"Gtess he don't want it kbown that'King Geordie has lost&#xD;
a friggit," said Asa ; '"but, Harry, yew don't meth tew give up&#xD;
Miss Wilton, quietly, dew. yer ? Yew can-reckon on ne and&#xD;
Lillywhite for backers, yew can."&#xD;
"As to her," auswered ' Harry, bitterly, "she's not worth&#xD;
another thought; buf him. I shall call to account for tampering&#xD;
with the feelings of!Agnes; and I'll know who'he is, too, before&#xD;
I sleep,'-or else he or I shall digest two or three inches'of cold&#xD;

steel. I'll go and see if he has told her who he is; and if I&#xD;
should want you to-night, Asa, I will come into your bed-room&#xD;
and call you."&#xD;
When Henry entered his sister's room, Agnes was sitting&#xD;
with her back to the door, and gazing out of the window; and&#xD;
so deeply wrapt was she in her thoughts, that until he had&#xD;
laid his hand on her shoulder, and said, "Asleep, or dreaming,&#xD;
Agnes ?" she was not aware that he had entered. Turning&#xD;
hastily around, she exhibited to his view a face of ashy pale-&#xD;
ness, and eyes that were yet glistening with tears, from recent&#xD;
weeping.&#xD;
"Agnes, love," said Henry, as he seated himself beside her,&#xD;
and took her hand within his, "how is this? what has hap-&#xD;
pened, to occasion you this sorrow? you look quite wretched,&#xD;
indeed you do, Agnes: what was you thinking of so deeply,&#xD;
when I entered ?",-&#xD;
"Nothing in particular, Henry," answered Agnes, with a&#xD;
faint attempt at a smile ; "you know, Harry, girls will some-&#xD;
times cry when they have no cause."&#xD;
"But you are not one of them," said her brother, seriously.&#xD;
"No, Agnes, you are not one to weep without a pause ; but&#xD;
I know what the .cause of your sorrow is, and it grieves me&#xD;
to the soul to think thata sister of mine should have such a&#xD;
case. You love this impostor-this cast-ashore-this Marston&#xD;
Spencer, as he calls himself."&#xD;
"Nay, Henry," said Agnes, hastily, "call him not impostor; *&#xD;
you know not that."&#xD;
"Has he not reported himself a merchant seaman,. when&#xD;
the ship in which he was wrecked was the Amphitryton, an&#xD;
English frigate ?" exclaimed Henry. "0, Agnes, Agnes, this&#xD;
affection for one like him, is unworthy you. Know you not,&#xD;
that Blanche Wilton and he are seldom separate? and that&#xD;
he is breathing in her ear, those words which, perhaps, an hou5&#xD;
before, he has spoken to you? Oh, Agnes! for my sake, and&#xD;
the honor of your sex, tear from your heart an affection so&#xD;
&#xD;
THE TWO fRFIQATES.&#xD;
&#xD;
45&#xD;
&#xD;
unworthily placed. As for the traitor himself, it shall not be&#xD;
long before I make him account for his conduct."&#xD;
"No, no, no, dear Henry !" exclaimed Agnes, imploringly ;&#xD;
"talk not of that; I will try to forget him, or anything at all,&#xD;
sooner than you should endanger your life by quarreling with&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"Little fear of that, Agnes," said her brother, as he arose&#xD;
to go; "he is too much of a coward to fight ; but I did not&#xD;
mean that, Agnes-so do not let the thought cause you uneasi-&#xD;
ness. Good night, love, and pleasant dreams; and try, for my&#xD;
sake, dear Agnes, to forget this wolf in sheep's clothing."&#xD;
That night, on Marston Spencer's entering his bed-room,&#xD;
he found a small, folded note, addressed to him, lying upon his&#xD;
dressing-table ; and, on opening it, saw it rants follows:&#xD;
"If, the person calling himself Marston Spencer, be not the&#xD;
coward, poltroon, and traitor, which the writer of this supposes&#xD;
him to be, he will leave his chamber as carefully as possible,&#xD;
a little after eleven o'clock, to-night,, and, descend into the&#xD;
farm-yard ; where he will find one who is desirous of some&#xD;
explanation of his conduct during his stay at Elm Farm." r&#xD;
Crushing the-note in his hand, Marston looked at his watch;&#xD;
then taking up a book, he sat down to wait as patiently as&#xD;
he could, the hour of meeting his unknown, though suspected&#xD;
correspondent.&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
THE COMBAT AND THE FLIGHT.&#xD;
"In duel met with dagger of revenge."&#xD;
I- is' night-the noon of night-and the crescent moon is&#xD;
pouring down  i grove, and plain, and stream, the mellow&#xD;
radiance of her silver beams; the twinkling stars, like so many&#xD;
brilliant eyes peering through a screen of violet-hued gauze,&#xD;
gaze lovingly down from their homes on high, as though wish-&#xD;
ing, like the Seraphs in the times of Eld,' to come down and&#xD;
mingle with the children of men. All is still, serene and quiet,&#xD;
and save the faintly heard&#xD;
" Surgy murmurs of the lonely sea,"&#xD;
as it breaks forevermore on the distant beach, not- a- sound&#xD;
mars, with jarring discord, the solemn stillness that hangs like&#xD;
a good man's blessing over the quiet landscape.&#xD;
In strange contrast to the holy calmness of this scene, are&#xD;
the emotions reigning in the breasts of the two men who have&#xD;
now entered a small open glade in the grove, a little in the rear&#xD;
of Elm Farm.&#xD;
Calm and beautiful, we say again, as was the quiet repose of&#xD;
nature, there was raging in the breasts of those men a storm&#xD;
of fierce and conflicting passions ; and which was only to be&#xD;
stilled (in their minds) by shedding the heart's blood of one&#xD;
another.&#xD;
0 man ! thou wert made in the express image of thy Creator ;&#xD;
&#xD;
'.&#xD;
.;&#xD;
,&#xD;
,&#xD;
L&#xD;
&#xD;
P1&#xD;
&#xD;
and endowed by him, with the divine attributes of reason and&#xD;
love ! Thou Wert placed in a paradise of earthly beauty, and&#xD;
for a while "the ways of thy life were peace."  But, alas! the&#xD;
desire of thy heart was sin ; yea, "as the hart panteth for the&#xD;
stream," thy soul thirsted for the cup of iniquity; and lu! thou&#xD;
didst take it and quaff it, and fell; aye, easy and without a&#xD;
struggle, to the serpent-like wiles of the Evil One. And the&#xD;
murder of Abel, the gentle and the good, wasthe first fruits of&#xD;
thy falling away from God ! and, as the pure and holy spirit of&#xD;
thy murdered victim, soared on high to the bright and eternal&#xD;
realms of bliss-Envy, Hatred and Revenge, with all their&#xD;
happy train, took up their abode in thy soul. Need we tell&#xD;
with what fervor thou hast obeyed their behests! Need we&#xD;
tell how under the name of HONOR ! thou hast bowed down the&#xD;
knee unto the bloody Moloch! No! thine own heart, and the&#xD;
hearts of husbandless wives and sonless mothers-made so by&#xD;
the infamous practice of DUELLING-can best answer such a&#xD;
question as that.&#xD;
Reader, pardon this digression. After they had entered the&#xD;
small glade in the grove, the two men whom we have men.&#xD;
tioned, threw off their coats ; then,' each drawing a cutlass from&#xD;
the scabbard he carried under his arm, they planted themselves&#xD;
foot to foot, and crossed their glittering blades.&#xD;
Previous, however, to any passes being exchanged between&#xD;
them, one of them exclaimed-&#xD;
"Then you refuse to make known your real name? or to&#xD;
give your word as a man of honor, that you will remain on pa-&#xD;
role during the continuance of the war between Great Britahi&#xD;
and the States ?"&#xD;
" Yes, to a common reefer like thee.!" answered the Other,&#xD;
who, as our readers have suspected, was the youth calling him.&#xD;
self Marston Spencer. "Come on, without further parley'; I&#xD;
am impatient to chastise thee, for daringto address a gentleman&#xD;
in the manner thou'hast me."&#xD;

lain, rather," exclaimed Harry Weston, with a sneer, at the&#xD;
same time making, a pass at his opponent's breast. It was par-&#xD;
ried, and the combat then began in real earnest.&#xD;
In regard to size,, strength, and the management of their&#xD;
weapons, the tw; young men were on pretty equal footing ; the&#xD;
advantage, if any, being on the side of Spencer; he being as&#xD;
collected and eool in his movements, as though merely taking&#xD;
a lesson at the fencing school, instead of being engaged in a&#xD;
fight where the result was to be life or death.&#xD;
Harry Weston, on the contrary, was considerably excited.&#xD;
For the contemptuous manner in which Spencer had treated&#xD;
him; the thought of his supplanting him in the affections of&#xD;
J3lanche, and of the misery he had wrought in the breast of&#xD;
Agnes, had roused his naturally excitable nature to a height of&#xD;
ungovernable fury ; and though this perhaps hindered him from&#xD;
taking advantage of any sudden unguarded position of his'&#xD;
enemy, it lent an energy and lightning-like rapidity to his&#xD;
blows, that caused his opponent to exert all his skill of fence,&#xD;
in order to keep himself out of "harm's way."&#xD;
Suddenly the blade of Tarston's cutlass snapped close off by&#xD;
the :guard, as. he was parrying a tremendous blow, which&#xD;
Harry, with all his strength, had aimed at his head.&#xD;
Beg your life, villain, or I strike !" called out the excited&#xD;
Henry, as he raised his cutlass above the head of Spencer.&#xD;
"Never, from a boor like thee!" hissed the latter through his&#xD;
clenched teeth, at the same time drawing a siali stiletto from&#xD;
his bre t, and, with a sudden spring plunging it'to the hilt in&#xD;
the upgarded bosom of Henry !&#xD;
Without a groan, the unfortunate youth fell heavily to the&#xD;
ground;, while at, the same moment, a wild piercing shriek&#xD;
smote upon the assassin's ear, and Agnes Weston stood before&#xD;
him&#xD;
Snatching up his goat, and the sword that had fallen from&#xD;
the hand of Henry, the guilty Spencer fled hastily from the&#xD;
spot.&#xD;

dressed himself a little after -twelve o'clock, on the night the&#xD;
duel took place.; Harty Westpn, as-he had promised, had come&#xD;
softly intp Asa's bed-room, and told him to get up and be a wit-&#xD;
ness of the duel about.to take place between him andSpencer;&#xD;
but as Harry was in too much of a hurry to waste; a great deal&#xD;
of time in rouiig him, Asa, had :gradually fallen over to sleep&#xD;
again:; and;only woke;up, about an hour after the two youpg&#xD;
men had left the farm.&#xD;
Afgrhehaddresse4bimself, 4atole softly dawn stairs, and&#xD;
hastened to the ypardin the rear ofthe farm; but neither Spen.&#xD;

in complete, perplexity as to how to act.&#xD;

He was not long in reaching the glade ; and the first objects&#xD;
that met his view, when he entered it, were Markham Sinclair,&#xD;
the Recluse, endeavoring to restore Agnes Weston to con-&#xD;
sciousness, as she lay insensible on the ground, near to the&#xD;
seeming lifeless form of her brother.&#xD;
Asa no sooner appeared, than the Recluse arose to his feet,&#xD;
and motioned to him to take up the body of Henry, and&#xD;
carry it to the farm; whilsthe,: on hi , part, would take care of&#xD;
Agnes.&#xD;
As Asa stepped forward to'do so,:his fodt struck against&#xD;
some hard substance on the ground ; and, on stooping down to&#xD;
see what it was, found it to be a small dagger, its blade and&#xD;
'handle incarnadined with blood.&#xD;
"Guess I'll take this to the farm," said Asa, putting it into&#xD;
the capacious pocket of his coat ; then turning to the recluse,&#xD;
he continued-" it seems to me, stranger, thar aint ha' been&#xD;
fair play here; did yew'see 'em fight ?"&#xD;
The recluse did not answer.&#xD;
"Of all the darndest chaps that ever I cum across, yew beat&#xD;
all, yew dew, by Jerews'lem. I'll be gawl darned if I think&#xD;
yew'd speak tew Old Scratch himself, was he tew bid you good&#xD;
mornin'. If yew've no ile to ile 'yer jaws,' we've get nations&#xD;
on't at the farm, we hey, and yew can hev some."&#xD;
Disregarding this obliging offer of Asa, the recluse now took&#xD;
up Agnes in his arms; and after pointing once more to the&#xD;
body of Harry, 'left the glade in the direction of Elm Farm.&#xD;
As Asa was raising Harry on his shoulder, a low moan&#xD;
issued from his lips, announcing the joyful intelligence that the&#xD;
"Grim King" had not yet'claimed his victim..&#xD;
"Hoorah! hoorah! hoorah !" shouted Asa, like a stentor;&#xD;
"alive yet, by creation !" and so saying, he started off with his&#xD;
burden at a rapid pace, in order to obtain assistance for Harry&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XL&#xD;
THE LETTER-" A CHAMBER SCENE"-THE ELOPEMENT PREVyTED.&#xD;
ON the same evening that the duel between Henry Weston&#xD;
and Marston Spencer took place, -Blanche Wilton' had retired'&#xD;
to her couch rather earlier than usual;'but the "honey dew&#xD;
of slumber" refused to descend on the wakeful eyelids, and so&#xD;
steep her troubled senses in forgetfulness.&#xD;
Poor Blanche! since we last saw her, she has drunk deeply&#xD;
of the bitter cup of sorrow ; and hath proved by the sad test of&#xD;
experience, that the words of the immortal bard"of Avon-&#xD;
"the course of true love never did run smooth," are but too&#xD;
infallibly true.&#xD;
On coming down to breakfast on the morning after her uncle&#xD;
had'exhibited such a strange and terrible excitement on behold-&#xD;
ing her in company with Marston Spencer, a note was pre-&#xD;
sented to Blanche by her maid Juliet. On opening it, she&#xD;
found it to read as follows:&#xD;
"DEAR.NIECE-&#xD;
You must at once, and forever ! cease to regard the youth&#xD;
calling himself Marston Spencer, with the eyes of love ; and&#xD;
though my conduct in thus coercing your feelings, may, at the&#xD;
first thought, appear harsh and tyrannical, let it suffice you,&#xD;
when I say, that it is IMPERATIVE NEcEssITY which compels me&#xD;
thus to act; and thatwhen the proper time arrives for such a&#xD;
communication taking place, all shall be explained entirely to&#xD;
your satisfaction.&#xD;
Your uncle and guardian,&#xD;
MARKHAM SINCLAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6949-00000027"/>&#xD;
62&#xD;
&#xD;
THE YANKEE MIDDY; Oa,&#xD;
&#xD;
This letter plunged Blanche in the deepest woe, for it at&#xD;
once put an end to her fondly cherished visions of future hap-&#xD;
piness with her lover. Any attempt to change the decision of&#xD;
her uncle, she well- knew would be worse than useless, for His&#xD;
commands, like the laws of the Medes and Persians, when once&#xD;
passed, were irrevocable.,&#xD;
She was now, as we have said, laid on her couch, sad and&#xD;
unable to sleep. She had heard the old Dutch clock, on the&#xD;
staircase, strike nine, ten, eleven, and yet still she lay as wake-&#xD;
ful and unable to sleep as when she first laid down.&#xD;
The window of her bedroom looked irnto the garden; and as&#xD;
she thus say with her face towards it, she suddenly beheld the&#xD;
dark outline of a man's head rise gradually up, as though&#xD;
ascending on a ladder. In another minute the face of Marston&#xD;
Spencer met her astonished gaze, as he peered anxiously into&#xD;
the moonlit chamber.&#xD;
Scarcely knowing what she did, she arose and threw a loose&#xD;
wrapper around her form ; then advancing to the window, she&#xD;
raised it, and like a second Romeo, visiting the fair Capulet,&#xD;
Marston Spencer stepped into the apartment.,&#xD;
" "Dear -Marston," exclaimed Blanche, after she had closed&#xD;
down the window ; "oh why have you so endangered your&#xD;
life by coming to see me thus? I tremble to think whai' my&#xD;
uncle would do or say, if he was to know you were here.",&#xD;
"Your uncle is now from home," said he ; "though it may&#xD;
not be long before he returns; I will therefore at once tell you&#xD;
why I have visited you at this unseemly hour. Dear Blanche,"&#xD;
he continued, as he drew her, trembling like an aspen, to his.&#xD;
breast, "the inoment hath now arrived when we must either&#xD;
hid each other an' eternal adieu, or, together, now' leave 'your&#xD;
uncle's residence."N- &#xD;
'"My'God ! what has happened ?" gasped Blanche, wildly;&#xD;
" Young Weston, this evening, grossly -insulted 'and chal-&#xD;
lenged me: we met, at a short distance from the fart-foght-&#xD;
and he fell. I do not think he is dead, though."&#xD;

E.And you, :4eart.arston," she= exclaimed, surveying g him&#xD;
anxiously, "are you not wounded ?"&#xD;
"Not even a scratch, love:. but let me tell you what I have&#xD;
to{say, before your uncle returns. Balance , you have hitherto&#xD;
known me but as:the shipwrecked mate of an English E.ad=&#xD;
Indiaman: I will now undeceive you: the ship in which, I was&#xD;
wrecked, was his Britannic Majesty's frigate Amphitryton,&#xD;
of which I had the honor to be, first lieutenant. You start,&#xD;
dear.Blanche--but it was even so; nor can the proudest of&#xD;
England's lords boast of a nobler line of ancestry, or a name&#xD;
more garnished by deeds of high achievement, than I can;&#xD;
but let this be a topic for after-hours; .let me not forget that&#xD;
which is of more importance at present. Dearest Blanche,&#xD;
have I now to go from your presence, a miserable, heart-&#xD;
broken man, or accompanied by you, as mine own sweet bride&#xD;
elect,?"&#xD;
"0, Marston," exclaimed Blanche, as she lay weeping in his&#xD;
arms, "have pity on my weakness ! God knows I love none&#xD;
so well as you; but-but----this is so unexpected and so sudden,&#xD;
that I-I-cannot make up my mind to go now."&#xD;
"And is this to be the end of all our fond dreams of future&#xD;
bliss ?" -said Marston,. bitterly. "Oh, Blanche !---Blanche !--&#xD;
you have embittered for ever my happiness in this life, and&#xD;
I care not how soon death comes to relieve rpy heart of its&#xD;
anguish : but why not now ?" he exclaimed, with well-affected&#xD;
wildness; "why need I support this load of woe, when thus&#xD;
so easily I can rid myself of it, and for ever&#xD;
" Marston ! dear Marston !" she exclaimed, as she flung her-&#xD;
self into his arms to prevent him, as she thought, from falling&#xD;
'orb the point of his sword, which he had drawn. "I will go&#xD;
with you anywhere! Oh, put up your sword, or you will kill&#xD;
me with fear !"&#xD;
Spencer, who had thus,, by a slight touch of the melo-&#xD;
dtamatic, obtained his end, now clasped his deceived mistress&#xD;
closely to his breast ; and, after she had somewhat recovered&#xD;

&#xD;
her calmness, assisted her to get ready for departure. This&#xD;
did not occupy much time; so that in a very few minutes&#xD;
after, they had descended the ladder, and were hastening down&#xD;
the gravel-walk towards the little door at the end of the garden.&#xD;
Already had they got within a few yards, and were congratu-&#xD;
lating themselves on getting safely away before the arrival of&#xD;
the recluse, when the door was opened, and that singular indi-&#xD;
vidual himself entered the garden !&#xD;
To spring forward, and,,with a single blow, to fell Spencer&#xD;
to the earth-to snatch Blanche from his arms, and bear her&#xD;
safely into the house-was with the recluse the work of a mo-&#xD;
ment; but, on returning to the garden again-which he did&#xD;
as soon as he had placed the insensible Blanche on a sofa in&#xD;
the parlor-Marston Spencer was gone ! and, although he&#xD;
went to the outside of the garden, and gazed carefully around,&#xD;
he could behold no signs of the frustrated libertine !&#xD;
The latter, though falling.fron the force of the blow he had&#xD;
received, was not stunned ; and no soone" had the recluse left&#xD;
the spot, to convey his niece into the house, than he rose to&#xD;
his feet and fled, and, by availing himself of the bushes and&#xD;
trees growing in clumps about the neighborhood,'he succeeded&#xD;
in making good his escape. Passing himself off as a midship-&#xD;
man on parole, lie was at length enabled to cross into New&#xD;
Brunswick, aid, shortly after, to reach the, port of Halifax,&#xD;
Nova Scotia, which was then, as now, a rendezvous for British&#xD;
men-of-war.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
MULTUM IN PARVO.&#xD;
THE surmise of Marston Spencer was correct. The wound&#xD;
of tlarry Weston, though very serious, was not mortal. The&#xD;
blade of the dagger having come in contact with one of his&#xD;
ribs, it had glanced along just beneath the surface of the skin,&#xD;
without reaching arty vital part, though the excessive hemor-&#xD;
rhage had reduced him to a state of unconsciousness.&#xD;
The surprise of the parents of our hero, when Asa Brown&#xD;
awoke them, to make them acquainted with what had happened,&#xD;
may be better imagined than described; and while on one'hand&#xD;
the irascible old farmer launched forth a perfect tornado of&#xD;
curses against the treacherous niiscreant who hsd so abused&#xD;
his hospitality ; on the other, the old lady, after "a good cry,"&#xD;
declared, that "never, since she was a girl about fifteen, had&#xD;
there anything of the kind happened before."&#xD;
As for Agnes,: though her brother, at the early part of the&#xD;
night on which the duel took place, had  assured her that ho&#xD;
would not fight Spencer, she had placed no confidence what-&#xD;
eVer in the declaration, knowing that he only said so to quiet&#xD;
her fears. She had therefore, throughout' the evening, nar-&#xD;
rowly watched the proceedings of both. Harry, however,&#xD;
managed to elude all her vigilance; arid it was not until he&#xD;
and Spencer had started from the farm, that shekec me aware&#xD;
of their intentions. She had immediately folloevthen,.and&#xD;
tourad readeresy aroede1,-'n&#xD;
our        are already'aware how abortive was her a'itempt&#xD;
to prevent the duel taking place.&#xD;

&#xD;
Poor Agnes! the flight of the villain who had so serpent-like&#xD;
wound himself around her heart, caused her the profoundest&#xD;
misery ; the more so, as she had to conceal every external symp-&#xD;
tom of it from her parents, and wear a smile on her face,&#xD;
when at the same time her heart was breaking with grief.&#xD;
Under the skilful hands of his mother, our hero soon recover-&#xD;
ed sufficient strength to rise from, his couch. One circum-&#xD;
stance, in connection with the duel, we must not forget. This&#xD;
was the dagger which Asa had brought home in his pocket.&#xD;
On cleansing it from the blood that encrusted it, the words&#xD;
"Viscount Seaham," were found neatly engraved onthe qpper&#xD;
part of the blade; thus seeming to imply that their late guest&#xD;
was a scion of one of the proudest of Englaqd's ducal houses.&#xD;
Asa. Brown, happening ,to be present when this discovery&#xD;
was made, asked, with a strange, incredulous look, if it was a&#xD;
real fact that the "critter Spencer" was a "genewine lord ;'&#xD;
and on being told by Harry that there, was not, the slightest&#xD;
doubt but such was the case, he declared, that "he'd be all-fired&#xD;
if he couldn't lick his weight three times over, in Epglish loids,&#xD;
any morning, 'fore breakfast, without injuring his appetite at&#xD;
all--he could, by Jerewslem1"&#xD;
Late one afternoon, about a fortnight after the duel was&#xD;
fought, a letter was brought to Elm Farm, addressed to Henry.&#xD;
It was from his old commander, Captain Manly, inforrhing him&#xD;
that he must report himself on. board the INVi cIBI-a forty-&#xD;
four-gun frigate, then. lying at Boston-on thethird dayafter&#xD;
the receipt of that note-as the frigate wasethenunder orders&#xD;
to proceed on a cruise as soon as she could be got ready&#xD;
for sea.&#xD;
This was, indeed,, joyful news to Henry; for even the spells&#xD;
of home, and the scenes and associations connected with his&#xD;
boyhood,. had begun to pall upon his. senses, and to be viewed&#xD;
by him[ with a listless indifference. Like the bold rover&#xD;
-- {&#xD;
&#xD;
"Like an eagle caged, he pined,&#xD;
On the dull, unchanging shore ;&#xD;
He longed for the flashing brine,&#xD;
The spray, and the tempest-roar."&#xD;
This wish was, at length, to be gratified ; and so eager was&#xD;
he to be away, that, accompanied by Asa, he started for Wells&#xD;
by daybreak, on the morning after receiving the letter, intend-&#xD;
ing, if possible, to get a passage in a coaster, from thence to&#xD;
Boston.&#xD;

THE YANKEE MIDDY ; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
THE INVINcIBLE-A TOUGH YARN-SAIL, HO.&#xD;
&#xD;
T HE broad, red sun had just begun to dip in the western&#xD;
wave, and.tinge the glassy bosom of the deep with gorgeous&#xD;
hues of crimson -and gold, as the United States' frigate, the&#xD;
invincible, slowly and majestically glided past Point Shirley,&#xD;
and entered on the long-rolling billows of. Massachusetts Bay.&#xD;
The breeze, which in her passage down Boston harbor, had&#xD;
been little else than a series of cat's-paws, now freshened up&#xD;
into a brisk gale ; and, as the studden-sails were all set both&#xD;
alow and aloft on either side, the gallant frigate now sped&#xD;
merrily over the waves to the tune of some eight or nine knots&#xD;
an hour.&#xD;
"The sun set-and uprose the yellow moon ;"-&#xD;
and sweetly the lamps of heaven now came forth, one by one,&#xD;
and took their silent stations in the vault of heaven; while&#xD;
beneath their tremulous and pensive beams, the stately Invin-&#xD;
cible proudly and bravely careened over the broad; blue bosom&#xD;
of the mighty deep.&#xD;
Eight bells were struck, and the watch was set; and as our&#xD;
hero, Harry Weston, had 'the command of the forward star-&#xD;
board watch, he now came on deck snugly buttoned-up in his&#xD;
"grego," for Harry had four long hours to walk on that deck,&#xD;
and the night was bitter cold.&#xD;
The first night out of port is one that is always fraught with&#xD;
sad remembrances to the sailors; and is apt to impress even&#xD;
&#xD;
THE TWO FRIGATES.&#xD;
&#xD;
59&#xD;
&#xD;
the most callous and hardened, with emotions of tender melan-&#xD;
choly. All have had some'sad. leave-takings that are yet recent,&#xD;
and vivid in their thoughts: husbands-have parted from their&#xD;
wives and little ones-sons from their aged an4 venerable&#xD;
parents-and lovers from their weeping mistresses ; and, though&#xD;
our hero had not, indeed, at the moment of starting from Bos-&#xD;
ton, had such to throw'a gloom Over his feelings, nevertheless,&#xD;
now that the bustle and excitement of getting ready for sea&#xD;
and leaving port, was over, his thoughts, despite his efforts to&#xD;
the contrary, would call up from the dark abyss of the past&#xD;
sweet visions,;&#xD;
"And fancied wanderings with a fair-haired maid."&#xD;
To get rid, if possible, of these to him now unwelcome&#xD;
thoughts, our hero drew near to three of the forward watch,&#xD;
who he saw were engaged in that favorite occupation of "Old&#xD;
Salts,"-yarn-spinning. One--the grey-haired, weather-beaten&#xD;
captain of one of the forward starboard carronades-was seat-&#xD;
ed on the breech of the piece he commanded; while the other&#xD;
two-wh9 were old sheet-anchor veterans-each occupied&#xD;
the end of a shot-box. On our hero's approach, old Martin,&#xD;
the gunner, stopped in his yarn, but Harry bade him "forge&#xD;
a-head" again, as he wanted to hear it.&#xD;
"I may as well start over again," began old Martin, "as Mr.&#xD;
Weston wants to hear, it all. As I said before, then, it was in&#xD;
April, 1804, that 'I shipped on board the-Dido, a stout whaler,&#xD;
belonging to Nantucket, aid bound for a cruise to the South&#xD;
Sea stations. We started from Nantucket with a brisk, fair&#xD;
wind, on the. first Friday--mark that messmates-on the Fri-&#xD;
day in the month.&#xD;
"Our, captain,;who was also half owner of the ship,,was a&#xD;
young man ; and tho'f he was an awful hand at iggers, taking&#xD;
the sun, and all that, and besides could work the ship pretty&#xD;
well, was not fit to command a whaler. Why, messmates, he&#xD;
pretended-to laugh at, as old- wimmen's tales, all sich things, as&#xD;

6O-             THE VA1EE MIDD1 OR,&#xD;
it being unlucky to sail on a Friday, whistle atsa; er for&#xD;
landsman to be the first man:to go aloft after getting ot o&#xD;
port; things which old sailors, who have ploughedi the sear&#xD;
from being mere babies, as I mray say, know for sartin are real&#xD;
facts.&#xD;
"Among our crew there was one chap who went by the name&#xD;
of Langton, upon whom Y had no sooner clapped eyes, than I'&#xD;
knew surnmut was not all right with him. He had shipped the&#xD;
very day before we started, and though he was rigged as. a&#xD;
sailor, it was very plain to them as know a marlinspike from a_&#xD;
butcher's skewer, that he'd never been on salt water afore.&#xD;
His hands weie.as soft and nearly as small as those ofa woman,&#xD;
and his face quite as pale as a lass's that has outgrown herself.&#xD;
I told the captain this, but he said the chap had told him he'd&#xD;
been sick, and that was the reason he looked so pale. Well,&#xD;
for the first week or so all went right aboard the Dido : we had&#xD;
fair winds and fine weather, and the ship being a pretty good&#xD;
sea-craft, we bladed away at a spanking rate, I tell ye; but r&#xD;
knew that this wouldn't last forever ; I knew that never yet&#xD;
did a ship sail on Friday, without falling in with misfortins, and&#xD;
so it turned out with us at last.&#xD;
After we got to sea, it was soon seen who was right about&#xD;
that chap I mentioned, for the very first job he was set to do,&#xD;
he knew no.more how to begin ship-shape with'it than a wais-&#xD;
ter; and when the captain overhauled him abdut deceiving&#xD;
him, he never answered; but gave him a look that made my&#xD;
blood freeze in my veins, for I was standing near them at the&#xD;
time ; and, messrpates, you may believe me or not, but damme&#xD;
if that look didn't hinder me from sleeping that night.&#xD;
"After this circumstance, I noticed that the chap got kinder&#xD;
melancholy like ; he would sit for hours in his bunk, with his&#xD;
eyes fixed gn the planks, and never open his lips to any one;&#xD;
and if any of the men tried to rouse him up to make him talk&#xD;
he would give them one of his "Devil's looks," as I called then,&#xD;
that very soon made them' let him alone again. AbOut this&#xD;

ri Two FRUGATEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
t  !&#xD;
&#xD;
tirme too, often when I laid awake in ;my hammock, I used to&#xD;
}hear him talking=away to himself (for his hammock was slung&#xD;
text to mine,) about some 4  villain that had wrecked his peace&#xD;
ofimind, and robbed him of the flower that shed a parftitne&#xD;
over his path. 'through life' -and Xll sich play-acting stuff as&#xD;
that ; and once or twice he started up in his hammock, and&#xD;
seizing his jack-knife, jabbed it two or three times into his bed-&#xD;
clothes, hissing thro' his, teeth as he did it, " there, villain ! thus,&#xD;
thus, let me repay my debt of vengeance."&#xD;
"It was about noon on the second FRIDAY afterleaving port,&#xD;
that the weather, began to give symptoms of a change. - The&#xD;
wind chopped round to-S. S. E., and began to blow great guns&#xD;
I tell ye.; and at last, old Nep got his dander up, and sent his&#xD;
waves sweeping over the Dido, as though he meant to wash us&#xD;
all overboard; and we were at last obliged to stave -in all the&#xD;
starboard bulwarks, in order to allow the water to run off the&#xD;
decks. As the sun set, the wind increased ; and a little before&#xD;
eight bells struck, crack went the fore and main top-gallant&#xD;
masts; while, the close reefed main topsail and fore-topmast'&#xD;
staysail, that we had on her at the time, split into shreds with&#xD;
the report of a cannon.. The thunder peals,'too, were quite&#xD;
awful; and I expected nothing less than the ship to be in a&#xD;
blaze every minute, from the "bright, dazzling flashes of light-&#xD;
ning that followed each other in quick succession.&#xD;
.'As the weather grew worse, that'infernal'.fellow, Langton,&#xD;
seemed to become perfectly changed ; from being gloomy and&#xD;
taciturn, he now began to 'grow chatty, and burst out every&#xD;
now and then into fits of laughter ; and such laughter-it rade&#xD;
the very flesh creep on our bones to hear it.' At length, when&#xD;

spot! We all sprang upon the murderer directly, and tried to&#xD;
pinion him down, but it was no go ; what could flesh arid blood&#xD;
do agairist the Devil himself?  He hurled us from him'as&#xD;
though we had been babies, and giving a loud, shrill laugh, that&#xD;
I think I can hear now, he sprang over the bows and disap-&#xD;
peared forever!&#xD;
In a few minutes after Langton, or the Devil-for he was as&#xD;
much one as the other-had sprung overboard, the storm began&#xD;
to abate; and about a quarter of an hour after, it was a dead&#xD;
calm, while the moon shone brightly down upon us, like some&#xD;
bonny little wench ashore, greeting with a smile her "dear&#xD;
Jack," as he steps on shore all safe from the perils of the deep.&#xD;
After the vije, which was a pretty successful one, was over,&#xD;
and we got back to Nantucket, I left the ship ; and about a year&#xD;
after that, happening ohe day to be sauntering down Long&#xD;
Wharf in Boston, I heard somebody hail me, and turning&#xD;
round to see who it was, found it to be the captain of the Dido.&#xD;
After asking me how I got along, and sich like, he said,-&#xD;
"Martin, you recollect that fellow, named Langton, that used&#xD;
to bother you so aboard the old Dido ? Well, I have found out&#xD;
all about him: he was at one time a gentleman of pretty good&#xD;
standing in society, but being crossed in love, his intellects be-&#xD;
cme deranged, and he had to be placed in a private lunatic&#xD;
asylum, from which place he at last escaped; .and coming to&#xD;
Nantucket, with that deep cunning peculiar to madmen at times,&#xD;
he disguised himself as a sailor, and-you know the rest."&#xD;
"Of course I pretended' to swallow all this ; but I put it to&#xD;
you now-"&#xD;
"Sail ho !" shouted the look-out, on the fore top gallant cross-&#xD;
trees.&#xD;
" Where away ?" bawled our hero.&#xD;
"Three points on the weather bow."&#xD;
harry now walked aft, and informed the first lieutenantdf&#xD;
the fact,;adding that the ship was yet too far off, either to dis-&#xD;
tinguish what tack she:was on, or what description of vessel&#xD;
she was.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Vara weel, sir," answered his superior, who was a genuine&#xD;
son of " auld Scotia :" "ye can go forward and tell the men to&#xD;
keep a sharp look-out, and acquaint me when ye mak her out&#xD;
clearer."&#xD;
"Ay, ay,sir," answered Harry, touching his cap and walking&#xD;
forward again.&#xD;
The Invincible, however, though she was accounted the&#xD;
swiftest.keel in the American Navy, could get no nigher to&#xD;
the sail in view ; on the contrary, when at last eight bells were&#xD;
again struck, and our hero had to leave the deck, she was less&#xD;
distinctly seen than when at first discovered.&#xD;

THE.YANKEE MIDD'' OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
"When Yankee meets the Briton,&#xD;
Whose blood cohgenial flows,&#xD;
By Heaven created to be friends,&#xD;
By fortune rendered foes&#xD;
Hard then must be the battle fray,&#xD;
Ere well the fight is o'er,&#xD;
How they ride, side by side,&#xD;
While the bell'wing cannon roar,&#xD;
While the cannon's fire is flashing fast,&#xD;
And the bell'wing thunders roar."&#xD;
By sunrise, on the morning after she had left Boston, the In-&#xD;
vincible was nearly abreast the Isle of Shoals ; but though the&#xD;
atmosphere was quite clear, enabling the look-outs to command&#xD;
both a wide and extensive sweep of the -horizon, the sail, seen&#xD;
on the previous evening, was not visible. This circumstance&#xD;
caused a general feeling of dissatisfaction to be felt throughout&#xD;
the frigate ; for, from the little powder-monkeys up to the cap-&#xD;
tain, there was not one aboard but what was eager for a brush&#xD;
with John Bull, it having been supposed that she was one of&#xD;
the English squadron, which, for several months, bad been en-&#xD;
deavoring to keep Massachusetts Bay in a state of blockade.&#xD;
The breeze still continuing from the S. S. E., by eight bells,&#xD;
A. M., the long, low headland of Cape Porpoise was seen at the&#xD;
distance of some three miles on their lee bow ; and, as the In-&#xD;
vincible was going free before the wind, and under a heavy&#xD;
press of canvas, she soon left it considerably astern.&#xD;
"Sail ho !" suddenly sung out one of the men aloft.&#xD;
"Where away ?" shouted the officer of the watch.&#xD;
"About two miles off, sir, and just rounding the south cheek&#xD;
of Saco Bay."&#xD;

THE YANKEE MIDDY 'OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
69&#xD;
&#xD;
no less than three ensigns were seen ascending different parts&#xD;
of his rigging.,&#xD;
SWe:'wilf help him take some of that bunting'down again be-&#xD;
fore we've dong with him," said Captain Manly, as he witnessed&#xD;
this exhibition on tie part of his opponent.': " Boatswain," he&#xD;
continued, addressing that all important functionary, '  pipe the&#xD;
men aft---I kantto say afew words to them."&#xD;
In a few minutes-after, the whole crew were drawn up be-&#xD;
tween the mainmast and the foot of the quarter deck. Captain&#xD;
Manly now advancing, said--&#xD;
"My lads, you see there one o' John- Bull's cruisers; he is&#xD;
about our own size, or may be, has a little the advantage in&#xD;
that respect, but that is no matter;-now what I've called you&#xD;
aft'for, is to say this, that as long as two planks of this ship&#xD;
remain together, or while I' have strength to wield my sword,&#xD;
that flag (pointing to the one&amp;amp;at the masthead of the Invinci-&#xD;
ble) shall never b' struck!1 and--" but his further words were&#xD;
now drowned in the loud huzzas of 'the 'sailors, and it was some&#xD;
minutes ere he could agairnmake himself heard. "My-lads,".he&#xD;
at'length continued, "I think I know what those cheers mean:&#xD;
they mean, do they not? that you are of 'the same 'mind as&#xD;
myself; and that sooner than yOn bidody cross;should wave&#xD;
over the stars and stripes of Inble Sam, you will fight to the&#xD;
lass ganp td prove that'the name'of the-gallant vINVINiBLEwas&#xD;
not given invain? '&#xD;
After they had greeted 'this'address with three loud and&#xD;
deafening hurras, the meh separated to their several stations,&#xD;
and set about preparing the' hip for the forthcomimg combat.&#xD;
All the light sails had been 't keiP in on both vessels ; and&#xD;
under three topsails, foresail and jib,, they now rapidly neared&#xD;
each other. The sun was shining brilliantly ; and not a single&#xD;
cloud 'dimmed the clear empyrean. The cool, freshening breeze&#xD;
swept oer the waves, breaking as if in sport 'their. summits&#xD;
irto sai l patches'of 'foan; which, in the bright +iyaof the&#xD;
morning suh, glittered like so many clusters of diamonds.-All&#xD;
&#xD;
was 'fair and lovely lb look upon ; all save those' twice five&#xD;
hundred men who were now intently efeing eadh' other'With&#xD;
grim looks of defiance Sand hatred.&#xD;
The two frigates had now approached within little more than&#xD;
a hundred yards of each other: but without-with the excep-&#xD;
tion of hoisting their respective national colors-having exhibited&#xD;
the slightest signs of hostility; and"a spectator who had thus&#xD;
beheld them so silently and quietly' nearing each other, rightt&#xD;
have supposed that the 'captains of 'each were tnerely about' to&#xD;
inquire after one another's welfare.&#xD;
Suddenly the 'bows of the English frigate were hauledup&#xD;
closely to the wind; he by this manouvre intending if possible&#xD;
to obtain the weather-gage of his opponent; but, as at the&#xD;
same moment the like movement for the same purse had'beeri'&#xD;
made aboard the Invincible, t-he Englishman's intention was&#xD;
defeated; and instead of having obtained a position on the.&#xD;
weather-bow of the Irivincible,'from which he could with telling&#xD;
effect have raked heir, when the bows of;both ships swung round,&#xD;
he found himself, on the contrary, laid broadside on with her,&#xD;
and within less than musket-shot distance.          - E&#xD;
Both ships discharged their batteries at the same moment&#xD;
and with pretty nearly the same effeet'; anid then for upwards&#xD;
of ten minutes did they' continue thus 'hurling their iron missiles&#xD;
in quick and successive showers into each other ; and though&#xD;
thro' the dense'columns of smoke resting between them, the&#xD;
two frigates were quite invisible to each' other, the gnners of&#xD;
both ships were directed in their aiming by the flashes from their&#xD;
opponent's guns.&#xD;
The fire of the Americans was much more destructive' in its&#xD;
effects than that of'the English. For, while the Invincible,' with the&#xD;
exception of some of her braces' and' rigging being cut, and a&#xD;
few splinters torn from her buhwvrks, had received little or no&#xD;
damage; the Englishman, on the contrary, 'had 'his fEro-top-&#xD;
gallant-mast, and mizzen topmast shot away ; his foresyai'ds in&#xD;
the slings, and 'the greater' part of his 'rigging sO cut, that, being&#xD;

unable te work:his sails;. he had now .drifted so nigh to the&#xD;
Invincible, that Captain Manly gave orders for the boarders&#xD;
to be got ready to board him as: soon as he came a little&#xD;
nearer.,&#xD;
"You, Mr. McGyegor," said .the captain, addressing the first&#xD;
lieutenant, "will takehalf of;the marines, and twenty of the&#xD;
boards and board him' in the main-chains, while you, Mr:'&#xD;
Phillips," continued he, to the second lieutenant, "at the head&#xD;
of the remainder of the .marines and boarders, will enter him&#xD;
at the bows ; and I will follow myself with a third party."&#xD;
The lieutepants left the quarter-deck, and hastened to the&#xD;
differeiosts assigned them. Having drawn tp'theiz respe tive&#xD;

voice that sounded high above the din of the carnage,.called&#xD;

crew, "away, my lads! board him, you may?.."&#xD;
The men needed no second bidding ; : and the words' had&#xD;
scarcely passed the captain's lipsiere, headed by their respective&#xD;
leaders, tlhey scrambled over the' bulwarks and sprang on the&#xD;
enemy's deck.&#xD;
"Stand firm, men !" shouted the first lieutenant of the Eng-&#xD;

moment, captain Marnly,,after considerable: resistance, having&#xD;
at length succeeded in landing on the quarter-deck with a&#xD;
fourth company of boarders, vigorouslyattacked . them  in&#xD;
the, rear.,&#xD;
For a short time the English fought with the valor of&#xD;
desperation; but. situated as they were, it was very soon&#xD;
apparent on which side the coy nymph Victory wouldescend;.&#xD;
and tle captain of the British frigate seeing what folly it was&#xD;
to prolong the struggle, at length, called out that he had&#xD;
surrendered; and, being but a shorts distance from Captain&#xD;
Manly at the- time, he made his way up to him and tendered&#xD;
his sword.     ,&#xD;
'Captain Rogers," shouted Marston Spencer, or rather Vis-&#xD;
count Seaha~n, as we must now call him, as at the head of the&#xD;
boarders he. yet fought with desperate fury, "you have not&#xD;
surrendered the ship, have you ?"&#xD;
",Yes, Viscount, I havee,. shouted Rogers in reply. "It is&#xD;
only sacrificing the poor fellowvs' lives to resist longer."&#xD;
"You may do as you like, Captain Rogers," exclaimed Sea-&#xD;
ham ; "but as long as I can' wield a sword, I will never&#xD;
yield."&#xD;
"Captain Manly," said our hero, approaching his commander,&#xD;
"there is an old quarrel standing unsettled between me and&#xD;
that man. Will you permit me to serve both the States and&#xD;
myself by disarming him?"&#xD;
Whether something really did or did not attract Ca:ptainv&#xD;
Manly's attention on board the Invincible at that moment we'&#xD;
know not, but certain it is when Harry Weston spoke to him,&#xD;
he turned his head and gazed that way  Our- hero, therefore,&#xD;
acting on the well known adage, "silence :gives: consent,"&#xD;
&#xD;
sprang forward sword in hand to where his former opponent&#xD;
was still obstinately fighting against opposing odds.&#xD;
"Back, men," shouted Harry-to the boarders of the Invincible,&#xD;
who were pressing Spencer hard. "Stand back ! this scoun-&#xD;
drel belongs to me !" Crossing his opponent's blade, blows, "fast&#xD;
and furious" were soon passing between them.&#xD;
Suddenly, by a dexterous blow, Harry sent his adversary's&#xD;
sword flying through the air, thus leaving him completely at&#xD;
his mercy.&#xD;
/ "Strike !" shouted Seaham, maddened at his discomfiture.&#xD;
"Strike! I would do so I&#xD;

OLD SEA SONG.&#xD;
TIE sun had just begun to dip on the western verge of the&#xD;
horizon, as the Invincible, accompanied by her prize, hove in&#xD;
sight of Portsmouth.&#xD;
So severely had the English frigate suffered in the late&#xD;
engagement, that her captor had to take her in tow; her masts&#xD;
not being secure enough to bear any canvas, even had the&#xD;
necessary rigging been left whole to manage them. Nor was&#xD;
it in her spars and rigging alone that she had suffered. Her&#xD;
hull was completely riddled with the balls of her enemy; while&#xD;
in one or two instances, three of her port holes were smashed&#xD;
into one; thus affording another striking proof of that superiority&#xD;
in gunnery, which in the cases of the Constitution and Guer-&#xD;
riere, the Essex and the Alert, the Wasp and the Frolic, had&#xD;
earned for American seaman, a world-wide reputation. The&#xD;
killed and wounded on both sides had been considerable and&#xD;
very nearly equal. But with the exception of Hector McGregor&#xD;
and Charles King, the first and third lieutenants of the Invincible,&#xD;
and the second lieutenant and quarter-master of the St. George,&#xD;
&#xD;
(for such was the name of the Etiglish frigate,) no fficersof dote&#xD;
had fallen.&#xD;
As for the Invincible-with the exception of sons&amp;amp;rent s i&#xD;
her sails, and asplinter or tW6 knocked from her bulwarks anid"&#xD;
deck spars-through the active' exertions-of her cr'ew, sheiot&#xD;
presented but very few tokens of the late'ngagehient"fok ht&#xD;
decks had been washed clean of the human gore that at the&#xD;
conclusion of. the light had given. them  such .a horriblel.&#xD;
" shambles" like appearance; the: wounded{had ,allibeen&#xD;
removed below to the cockpit and hospital cots ;s and the-dead,&#xD;
friends and:foes, consigned to their last resting 'place in the,&#xD;

About an hour after first coming in sight of land; the Ivrvipcible&#xD;
and her prize arrived abreast of Continental' Island in Ports.&#xD;
mouth harbor; and after returning in gallant style: the salute&#xD;
which they received in passing the:Navy Yard,,proceeded up&#xD;
the harbor, until at last, When within a few rodsr distance from&#xD;
the pier; they finally dropped anchor.&#xD;
That night, a splendid ball and entertainment were got up by&#xD;
the principal inhabitants ofi Portsmouth, in. honor of. the new&#xD;
"leaf"that had been added to the glorious' naval wreath;which&#xD;
Decatur, Bainbridge, Hull, La4rrence and others, had plucked&#xD;
so gallantly' from the haughty brows of Brittania! .That night,&#xD;
Captain Manly and his officers were the cynosures of. alleyes;&#xD;
and as the glance}of :many a fair maiden rested admiringlyon&#xD;
their manly forms; while she at the same time recalled to mind'&#xD;
their more manly deeds, her little heart would flutter with new-&#xD;
born andbthrilling emotions of love and tenderness for those&#xD;
brave defenders of theiricountry's rights,- s That night was.one&#xD;
that the -officers of the Invincible long spoke of with.'rapturous&#xD;
delight; for the entertainment got up for their especialhonorp&#xD;
was. indeed:a gorgeous and recherche affair--..&#xD;
"The lamps shone O'er fair women and brave men,&#xD;
Athousand herts boat happily ; and when&#xD;
Music arose with its voluptuous swell,&#xD;
Soft eyes looked love to eyes which'spake again,&#xD;
And all went merry as a marriage bell."&#xD;

That night, had our hero had aheart to dispose of, he would&#xD;
not have had the slightest difficulty in finding more than one&#xD;

giying.s a guarantee Qf its safekeeping, her own in return ; but&#xD;
Ihrry. had not been able to forget Bhnche Wilton yet; and&#xD;
though on this night, he did&#xD;
"Whisper sweet nothingsin many an ear-"&#xD;
he never crossed the boundaries of the realms of Flirtation.&#xD;
;Early nekt morning, Captain Manly 'dispatched an official&#xD;
statement of his engagement with, and capture of the British&#xD;
frigate, to thd Secretary of the Navy Department at Washington;&#xD;
and in mentioning the names of the officers who had principally&#xD;
distinguished themselves in the action, that of our Middy, Harry&#xD;
Weston, was far from being overlooked.&#xD;
In the afternoon, the crews of both frigates tvere oi-dered on&#xD;
shore, where ofl arriving, they were drawn up, four abreast.&#xD;
on the pier. The bodies of Lieuts. McGregor and King, with&#xD;
the lieutenant and quarter-master of the St. George, having&#xD;
been brought ashore'and placed on separate hearses,'the whole&#xD;
cavalcade, accompanied by the marine band, playing the Dead&#xD;
March in Saul, set forth, and shortly after halted at the ceme-&#xD;
tery of St. John's church;' and here, with all naval honors, the,&#xD;
remains of the four brave officers were consigned to their graves.&#xD;
"Requiescant in pace."&#xD;
On the same evening, the commander and officers of the St.&#xD;
George, were suffered to depart whither they thought proper,&#xD;
on their giving their words of honor, that they would not,&#xD;
attempt to escape, or serve against the Americans, during the.&#xD;
continuance of the war. The sailors were marched off to one&#xD;
of the interior garrisons to await until they were exchanged for'&#xD;
an equally number of American seamen.&#xD;
New sails having been bent, and everything made sea trim&#xD;
again on board the Invincible, early on. the.second morning&#xD;
after her arrival at Portsmouth, her anchor Was once more&#xD;

on fleet horses, left the town of Wells, in Maine ; and takiz&#xD;
the road which for some distance ran parallel with, the coast,&#xD;
they cantered 1 l6hg for nearly half an hour in complete&#xD;
silence.     f_&#xD;
At length, slackening his pace a little, one of them cdcled'out&#xD;
to his companion-&#xD;
"Gently, Brown, pull up: we must not get there toe soon.&#xD;
Like Jack Falstaff, and his merry companions-'&#xD;
"We must o by the moon and seven stars ;&#xD;

About a quarter of an hour after this conversation had taken&#xD;
place, on arriving at the summit of a small acclivity in the&#xD;
road, the tall chimneys of Elm Farm were seen peering through&#xD;
the trees surrounding it, apparently about a mile or so from&#xD;
the spot where they then were.&#xD;
"There is the residence of your charmer!" exclaimed the&#xD;

" How shall we get down to the farm? I see no road which&#xD;
leads from this towards it. Shall we-have to adopt the English&#xD;
steeple-chase style--leap fences and ditches ?"&#xD;
"No," replied the Viscount; "a quarter of a mile or so further&#xD;
on, there is a road that leads from this onie to within a few&#xD;
hundred yards of the farm. We can place our nags in the&#xD;
grove, where, as I told you, I pricked Weston. You have not&#xD;
forgotten the gags, I hope ?"&#xD;
"I have them all right."&#xD;
"I am glad of that ; for if they happen to turn obstreperous,&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
THE RIVALS.-,-A DUEL.--TUE LETTER.&#xD;
"In love,&#xD;
Who respects friends ?"&#xD;
ABOUT the same time that Viscount Seaham and his com-&#xD;
panion drew up their horses to reconnoitre the end of their&#xD;
journey, three individuals might have been seen entering a&#xD;
small shrubbery a short distance from the residence of Mark-&#xD;
ham  Sinclair, the recluse. Two of these individuals have&#xD;
already figured conspicuously in our tale, being no other than&#xD;
Asa Brown, and the negro, Marc Antony, but the third one, as&#xD;
yet, is a stranger to the reader.&#xD;
He was apparently about the same age as Marc, and like&#xD;
him, a descendant of Cush. His name was Caesar Augustus,&#xD;
and was in the employ of the recluse.&#xD;
Having advanced a short distance into, the grove, our trio&#xD;
arrived at a place, where, some of the trees having been felled,&#xD;
there was a clearing a few rods in extent. Here they halted;&#xD;
and Asa Brown, seating himself on the trunk of one of the&#xD;
fallen trees, thus addressed his two sable companions :&#xD;
"Naow jest look here, the pair of ye; yew have axed me tew&#xD;
see fair play atween ye, and by Jerusalem I will. Yew'd bet-&#xD;
ter fight slick up and down, then, or spite my picter if I don't&#xD;
lici the pair of ye myself. Naow fall tew, and the chap that&#xD;
holds out longest shall hey the gal."&#xD;
Having delivered himself to this effect, Asa took outhis jack-&#xD;
knife, and conmaienced "notching" the tree he sat on.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Now Marc Antony," said Cesar, addressing his rival as&#xD;
they stood up front to front, "you dat hab been my bussum&#xD;
fren for long time, I axes you as a genelum, and for de last&#xD;
time, will you gib up all your 'tentions to de 'fections ob&#xD;
Julet ?"&#xD;
"Duz de chile's mammy know he's out ?" said Marc, show-&#xD;
ing his "ivories."&#xD;
"No genelum talk dat way, sah I" exclaimed Cesar, indig-&#xD;
nantly ; for, having formerly been the property of an officer in&#xD;
the south, he had, during his stay with him,imbibed many aris-&#xD;
tocratical notions, to which the more plebeian reared Marc was&#xD;
a complete stranger.&#xD;
"Ki! he call hissef genelun'1!" shouted Marc, in .derision,&#xD;
"Why yer daddy was a nigger, so am his son.".&#xD;
"I scorns de 'sinewation, sah! and e f-.r'&#xD;
"Stop that ar jaw work, will yew !" exclaimed Asa,,suddenly&#xD;
pausing in his notching process, and addressing the bellige,&#xD;
rents. "Jest shet up, I say, and go tew  work. I'm   not&#xD;
agoing to sit here all night, listening to your infernal lingo, I&#xD;
tell yew."&#xD;
"iHe call hissef a genelum," shouted Marc, as with a broad&#xD;
grin of derision, he turned towards Asa.  s&#xD;
"I behabe like one, sah; an' you dont," sai4,Cedar:&#xD;
"If yew wont} fall tev, I will," exclaimed iAsai rising from&#xD;
his seat, and turning up the cuffs of his coat.  ;&#xD;
"Cum on, you bugger," shouted Marc to his rival, as soon as&#xD;
he witnessed this movement of Asa's.&#xD;
"You strike me of you dare, sah !" retorted Cesar,.placing&#xD;
himself in a defensive posture.&#xD;
"You hab to strike fust ; yougib de challenge," said Marc.&#xD;
"No, sah ! de challenged hab de fust blow,"replied Cesar.&#xD;
Marc was 'about to reply to this, when hip eye. caught a&#xD;
glimpse of Asa moving towards them; and knowing;from xpe-&#xD;
rience that a blow from Asa's fist was~ a iciroumstance to be&#xD;
remembered for some time afterwards' he wisely chose the&#xD;
lesser evil of the two---that of a fight with his rival.&#xD;

which he. kept mufed over the lower part of his face.F&#xD;
"You belong to that house over there, don't you.?" said the&#xD;
stranger,,poimping to Elm Farm as he addressed Asa. ,&#xD;
"Wal, naow dew tell! that is news," exclaimed Asa ; "and&#xD;
whar might yew hail from, stranger ?"&#xD;
,' That is of no consequence, at present," answered the&#xD;
stranger  "Here is a .letter," he continued, taking one from&#xD;
his vest pocket, "which I wish placed in the hands of Miss&#xD;
fgnes Weston; it is from her brother !"&#xD;
"What, Harry !" exclaimed Asa.&#xD;
"Yes," replied the man ; "he gave it to me to deliver to her&#xD;
when he was in Portsmouth there about a week ago."&#xD;
"And yew know Harry, then, stranger ?" queriedAsa.&#xD;
"Oh, yes, very well," was the answer ; but Lieut. Broom-&#xD;
for it was, he who was now addressing Asa-did not acquaint&#xD;
the querist now he came to know Harry so well.&#xD;
".Give us yer fist," said Asa, at, the same time seizing the&#xD;
stranger's hand with such a grip, that he soon; roared out with&#xD;
rain under the infliction.&#xD;
"Gently, gently,;my good friend," he exclaimed, ",my hand&#xD;
is not made of iron. But about this letter. You must put it&#xD;
into her hands, without either her father or mother seeing it;&#xD;
for such, were the words of Henry when he gave me the let-&#xD;
ter. I believe it .is something about his connection with Miss&#xD;
Wilton, which he don't want any one to know about but his&#xD;
sister."&#xD;
Asa gave a loud whistle, and nodded his head several times&#xD;
in a peculiar manner, as he took the letter and put it carefully&#xD;
in his pocket.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Now you will be sure to let no one see it but Agnes her-&#xD;
self," said the disguised Broom, as he turned to leave them.&#xD;
"All right, stranger," answered Asa, with a nod of acqui-&#xD;
escence.&#xD;
"Massa Brown," said Marc, when Lieut. Broom had left&#xD;
the spot, "what you tink of dat man? Seem to me I hab seen&#xD;
him 'fore."&#xD;
"Whar ?" asked Asa.&#xD;
"Don't know," answered Marc; "me can't 'member dat&#xD;
no how."&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
&#xD;
MU#1NGS-Ti1E OAPTURP   :-E. -.'&#xD;
AGNES WESTON is sitting alone in .her own little room, and&#xD;
gazing out on the calm blue vault of heaven. But though the&#xD;
patient stars were trembling and glittering brightly on high;&#xD;
though the fair pale moon, having now risen over a distant&#xD;
hummock, was shedding over all the mild refulgence of her sil-&#xD;
ver beams, to Agnes, everything looked cold, dark, and cheer-&#xD;
less. Poor Agnes! she had striven, but striven in vain, to root&#xD;
out from her heart the love which she bore to Marston Spen-&#xD;
cer. She had endeavored, by recalling to her mind his double&#xD;
dealing with her and Blanche Wilton, his ingratitude to her&#xD;
parents for their hospitality, and above all, his attempt to mur-&#xD;
der her brother, to eradicate her love by the counteracting feel-&#xD;
ing of detestation. But it would not do. For every fault he&#xD;
had committed, there welled up from the depths of her woman's&#xD;
heart a palliative. Had not her jealousy led her to color too&#xD;
highly his conduct towards Blanche Wilton?  Had. she not&#xD;
made mountains where there were only mole-heaps? And was&#xD;
it not in self-defence that he smote her brother nigh unto death?&#xD;
Had she not herself heard Harry declare he meant to seek&#xD;
Marston, and force him to a quarrel?&#xD;

How was it possible that HIS eagle-like glance could emanate&#xD;
from a soul that was rnean and dishonorable ? or, that a heart&#xD;
of guile could give utterance to such fervent, such soul thrilling&#xD;
language as his?   Ah, no. Marston had been wronged, cru-&#xD;
elly wronged by the unjust suspicions of all.&#xD;
Such were the thoughts, and such the train of reasoning,&#xD;
that was passing through the mind of Blanche Wilton, as she&#xD;
sat and gdzed from the window of her little room on the calm,&#xD;
clear sky.&#xD;
And, as she still sat gazing and musing on her many sorrows,&#xD;
and her ill-starred love, the words of an old melody, then popu-&#xD;
lar in New-England, came .with vivid distinctness into her&#xD;
mind, as has been wonderfully expressive of'the then sad state&#xD;
of her feelings ; and at last, as though some wandering breeze&#xD;
had evoked from the strings of a wind-harp, 'a tremulous and&#xD;
tnlooked for melody, her-lips opened, and there gushed on the&#xD;
still ear of night, the following--&#xD;
OANZONET.&#xD;
Oh ! who can tell the bitter pangs&#xD;
The linely heart must feel,&#xD;
Which' loves; but ah'! from all around&#xD;
That feeling must conceal?,;&#xD;
Even as doth the gentle dove,&#xD;
When wounded by some swain,&#xD;
Fdld o'er-the wsuhd her shelt'ring wings,'&#xD;

For oh! he'll bring tome,&#xD;

her, in the very room where she was. Turning hastily pound,&#xD;
she beheld, looming through the gloom, a foot or.two from her,&#xD;
the talk form, of As, Browp. Vie was standing in the middle&#xD;
of the room, and was gazipg intently upon her.f&#xD;
"Asa, how you startled me," exclaimed Agnes; "I never&#xD;
heard ybu come in."&#xD;
"Why, yew see, Miss. Agnes," said Asa, whispering ; "I&#xD;
took off my boots, apd came in as softly as.I could, and yew&#xD;
were singin. Guess that's why yew didn't hear me."&#xD;
" But what is the matter, Asa? What cause is there for this&#xD;
stealthiness ?"'&#xD;
"I didn't want to let the old man or yer mother hear me.&#xD;
Here is a letter from Harry."&#xD;
"From Henry ?" ejaculated Agnes; "when did it come?&#xD;
where did you get it ?",&#xD;
"Speak lower, Miss Agnes, will yer ? the old folks musn't&#xD;
know anything about your gitting it. As I was cummin' from&#xD;
Dummy's tew night, just after sundown, I met a.feller near tew&#xD;
long-acre field, and he guy it ie, and said I was tew let no&#xD;
one see it but yew-Harry had told him to say so. He said&#xD;
he guessed it was something 'bout Blanche Wilton. Shall I&#xD;
get yew a light ?"&#xD;
" No," said Agnes. "I have a tinder-box, with flint and&#xD;
steel. Thank you, Asa, for bringing me the letter so carefully;&#xD;
and when I see you in the morning, I will tell you if there is&#xD;
anything particular in it."&#xD;
After a whispered good night, Asa left the room.&#xD;
Agnes soon procured a light. Then, tearing open the letter,&#xD;
her surprise may well be conjectured, when, instead of a letter&#xD;
from her brother, she found it to be one from him, who, but a&#xD;
few minutes before had been the paramount object of her&#xD;
thoughts.&#xD;
The letter ran as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
THE TwO FRIGATES.                 8$&#xD;
"To Miss AGNES WESTON:&#xD;
"A wretched and heart-broken penitent, bowed down&#xD;
with the knowledge of his own unworthiness,.craves but: five&#xD;
minutes conversations with her who has ever been the load-star&#xD;
of his thoughts:and feelings. He Will-be found ivaiting in the'&#xD;
little grdve-where his unfortunate duel with her; brother took&#xD;
place--any hour fron:sunset to niidnight; when, if he has not&#xD;
by then, had an opportunity of clearing his conduct of its seem.&#xD;
ing culpability, to her who alone has a right to: demand it, he&#xD;
will place.a pistol to his head, pull the trigger, and so at once&#xD;
put an end to his cares and sorrows on earth.&#xD;
It was well that Asa Brown was not there when Agnes read&#xD;
this epistle. For, the emotion which she exhibited during its&#xD;
perusal, and for a long time after she had finished it, would cer-&#xD;
tainly have caused him to ask questions which Agnes, we&#xD;
rather suspect, would not have very well liked, to answer.&#xD;
Could it be possible that he, who, for months past had been&#xD;
"her thought's idol," was now within less than a:quarter:lof a&#xD;
mile from the spot'where she was?  It could not be-'.-she was&#xD;
surely dreaming! But no! is there not the letter itself laid&#xD;
open before her ; THAT is real:&#xD;
Severe was the struggle which took placein, the :mind of&#xD;
Agnes after she had perused the letter; for, while on the one&#xD;
hand her powerful love, for the writer would fain have tri.&#xD;
umphed over all obstacles, and induced her to meet him; on&#xD;
the other, the "still small voice" of prudence and propriety&#xD;
prayed her to refrain. "Is it safe," said : prudence, "to trust&#xD;
yourself in a lone,: secluded grove, with one who on the very&#xD;
spot attempted the:life of your brother.?"  " Is it not a snare,&#xD;
think you," whispered propriety, "to entrap, your unsuspecting,&#xD;
innocence, and plunge you still deeper and more. profoundly&#xD;
into the 'dark waters?'" . And;what will your parents say;or&#xD;
think, supposing they should' get knowledge of your going.&#xD;

Long did she continue thus, a prey to the most agonising and&#xD;
conflicting thoughts; and unable to make up her mind to go or&#xD;
not. 'At length,.however, she hastily arose frotn hersseat, and&#xD;
blew, out her light'; then opening her room'door, she advanced&#xD;
a little into the passage, ahd listened :attentively. -All was&#xD;
still.&#xD;
Re4entering the room, she proceeded to don her bonnet and&#xD;
shawl;- and having again listened to hear:that all was still, she&#xD;
stole stealthily down stairs, and passing through the back&#xD;

as= though wishful of accompanying :her.; Thinking that he&#xD;
would be some. little protection for her, she suffered him to&#xD;
come t.out ; then; closing the' door softly to, she started on her&#xD;
journey.'.&#xD;
In about ten minutes after, Agnes; accompanied by Nep,&#xD;
stepped.timidly into the little' glade of the Elm Grove,' which&#xD;
has already played such.a oonspibuous-part in our tale:: and&#xD;

utes had been hidden behind a cloud, shone. brightly down upon&#xD;
the' quiet little glade, revealing every object init with'the clear&#xD;
distinctness of day. What was the surprise and':emotion of&#xD;
Agnes, when, instead of the features of Marston Spencer, her,&#xD;
eyes rested on those of one whom she she had just cause to&#xD;
regard with horror and detestation!.&#xD;
Agnes turned -to leave the'-spot ; but in an instant Broom&#xD;

"Unhand me, sir," cried Agnes, en4eavorng, bct in vain to&#xD;

"Miss Weston, nay Agnes, dear Agnes," said the villin ;&#xD;
" will you n ot listen to nime for one minute ?"&#xD;
Instead ofreplying, Agnes siddenIy snatched her hang from&#xD;

Vttteringa curse, "not loud but deep," Broom sprang forward&#xD;
to detairiher.Je had scarcely advanced two yard, hpvever,&#xD;
ere Neptune turned, and springing upon him, bore him heavily&#xD;

It wasa fierce struggle; for Neptune had got afim Bold,&#xD;
and what was more, he seemed determined .on. eeping it.&#xD;
Over, and over,nand over ,hey rolled ; Neptune burying his&#xD;

THE YANKIE MIDDY; OR,&#xD;
and it was not until after he' had made severe 'atempts, that&#xD;
he did at last succeed in rising to his feet. '&#xD;
Supporting himself by the trees, he at last reached the spot&#xD;
where the Viscount's horse and his own were fastened, aid&#xD;
takii the riding cloaks that were thrown over the backs of,&#xD;
each, he wrapped himself in them, and sat down at the f'ot of&#xD;
a tree, to await the coming of his companion in villany.&#xD;
For some time the pain of his wound was so excruciating,&#xD;
that he could not rest two minutes together' in one' posture;&#xD;
but, after a while, a dull, numbing, drowsy species of sensadoin,&#xD;
which he could in no wise shake off, began to steal over him.&#xD;
He seemed to .grow weaker and weaker, while at the same&#xD;
time his brain whirled and burned in his head as though he 'was&#xD;
under the influence of strong potations of the "ardent." 'The&#xD;
extremities of his limbs, too, began to graw cold 'and stiff, nor&#xD;
was he able to stoop to chafe them.&#xD;
Gradually his head sank down on his breast; his body&#xD;
drooped forward and swayed to and fro for a few times ; a&#xD;
convulsive shiver shook his whole frame, while with a' sudden&#xD;
jerk his limbs stretched themselves out rigidly stiff-a deep&#xD;
groan burst from his lips, and with it, came forth the guilty&#xD;
spirit that ha'd for twenty-two years sojourned in 'the body of&#xD;
Augustus Broom.&#xD;
-When Agnes Weston, panting heavily through her unwoited&#xD;
exertions, once more arrived'at the farm, she stood for sazie-&#xD;
time before she entered, awaiting the return of Neptune. She&#xD;
doubted not but that after he had held her would-be-abductor&#xD;
for a short time, that he would leave him and hasten after her.&#xD;
But, as after waiting for nearly a quarter of an hour, he did riot&#xD;
make his appearance, she at last entered the house, and pro-&#xD;
ceeded softly up stairs to her own little room.&#xD;
- Fastening the door, she 'flung herself on the;bed'and cave&#xD;
full vent to the pent-up emotions of her soul, in an impassioned&#xD;
and copious flood of tears. How cruelly had she been de-&#xD;
ceived ! How rudely had her hopes been blighted, and her&#xD;

tude and respect, was bound to love and cherish her. One, for&#xD;
whom she would have left home, parents,-"brother, all; to follow&#xD;
him in fair weather or foul, in sorrow or in joy, in prosperity or&#xD;
in disgrace!&#xD;
Truly hath it been said, there is n9 fathoming the depths of&#xD;

on any particular object, nothing but the stern conqueror of&#xD;

"The heart that hath truly loved never forgets,&#xD;
But hs-truly loveson to the close,"&#xD;

more instance to the truth of his words.&#xD;
Cruelly as he had deceived her, the infatuated girl bore to&#xD;
Marston Spencer aS devoted a love as ever ; and had he even.&#xD;
now stood before her, and in his soul-thrilling tones besought&#xD;
her to pardon him, gladly, oh, how gladly ! would she have&#xD;
done it, and gone with him anywhere.&#xD;

f     " Who would read in this form&#xD;
The big soul.of the son of. a long line ?&#xD;
Who, in this sunken, sickly eye, the pride&#xD;
Of rank and ancestry ?"&#xD;
AFTER Marston Spencer, or rather Viscount' Seaham had&#xD;
parted from his companion, Lieutenant Broom, in the, Eln&#xD;
Grove, he proceeded at a leisure pace, for it Was yet almost&#xD;
too soon to attempt putting his guilty, project into;action,&#xD;
towards the residence of Markham Sinclair, the recluses and&#xD;
having at length arrived there, he proceeded to cautiously&#xD;
reconnoitre all around, so as to commence his operations with&#xD;
a greater chance of success.&#xD;
As he was thus loitering about, and gazing up ever and&#xD;
anon at the house, he suddenly beheld a light stream from&#xD;
the bed-room window of Blanche, while at 'the same time her&#xD;
shadow passed and repassed several times behind the window&#xD;
curtain.&#xD;
"Now is the time," said the Viscount to himself, when the&#xD;
light met his eye; and stealing softly forward, he at last&#xD;
reached the garden gate, and essayed to open it. It was&#xD;
locked.&#xD;
This unlooked for circumstance at once seemed to annihi-&#xD;
late every chance of succeeding in his enterprise ; for the gar-&#xD;
den was surrounded by a stone-wall of some eight or nine feet&#xD;
in height, and whose straight, smooth face offered not the&#xD;
slightest foothold whereby he could scale it.&#xD;
"Necessity is the mother of invention," says an old saw; an&#xD;
axiom, the truth of which, Seaham now proceeded to illustrate&#xD;

the idea had struck him, that if he could catch it, he might&#xD;
easily from its back climb-over the wall. :ie Was successful&#xD;
in the attempt ; and'in another minute :was stealthily threading&#xD;
his way through the garden 'towards the'house.- tAt length he&#xD;
stood directly beneath the window of Blanche's bed-room,.and&#xD;
taking up a small pebble, he threw it up gently against it.&#xD;
The window was almost immediately opened, and the face of&#xD;
Blanche presented itself, as she peered anxiously-aboutt, in order&#xD;
to discover who had thrown the pebble.&#xD;
"Blanche," exclaimed' the Viscount in a softly modulated&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
Blanche bent her gaze fixedly down in the direction' the&#xD;
sound seemed to proceed; 6ut she could see no one; for at&#xD;
that moment the moon was hidden by' a cloud, and Seaham&#xD;
stood within the shadow of a magnificent lilac that grew 'near&#xD;
the house.&#xD;
"Blanche !" he exclaimed again in the same soft tone.&#xD;
"Who isit ?" asked Blanche, bending downwards&#xD;
"Marston Spencer," was the reply. "Can you not. come&#xD;
down to me,:dear Blanche," he added, "I have something of&#xD;
importance for your ear."&#xD;
"Yes," answered Blanche, "I will be with you directly."&#xD;
The maiden no sooner made. hei appearance in tie garden,&#xD;
than Spencer sprang forward and caught her in his arms 'and&#xD;
for several minutes the happy pair rerbained locked, in one&#xD;
fond, passionate embrace. Blanche at length-raised her head&#xD;
from its' resting place-his breast--and gazing in his face,&#xD;
with eyes, that spoke volumes of. fond, trusting, and devoted&#xD;
love, she said:-&#xD;
"Dear Marston, I had begun to think I' was riot going-to see&#xD;
you any more. Where ha've-you been since you were here&#xD;
last?" '&#xD;
"Le t us retire further down the garden, love," said Spen-&#xD;

forward ;-" your uncle may. perhaps overhear us where we&#xD;
are now."&#xD;
S"After I had s'o abruptly parted from you the last  night,I&#xD;
was here," began Spencer, as they seated themselves on ;one&#xD;
'of the rustic seats at the lower end of' the garden, "I made the&#xD;
best of my way to' Halifax, expecting there to find an English&#xD;
mat-o'-war4 I was not disappointed in my expectations.&#xD;
The St. George, a first class frigate, belonging to his Britannic&#xD;
Majesty, had put in there a day or two previous to my arrival.&#xD;
She had lost her first lieutenant, he having been killed 'in a&#xD;
slight brush which they had with a, Yankee,, previous to putting&#xD;
into Halifax. My position, as one of the peers of Englan.,&#xD;
and the fact of having held the post of first lieutenant on board&#xD;
the: Amphitryton, were recommendations that at once had their&#xD;
proper weight with the English captain. I was promoted to&#xD;
the post. It will be needless for me to relate our operations at&#xD;
sea; suffice it to say, that at last we fell in with an American&#xD;
frigate, greatly our superior in size, weight of metal, and nu-&#xD;
merical force of 'men ; but we heeded not that ; we only saw&#xD;
the enemies of our king; we at once attacked them, and but&#xD;
for the conduct of some traitors on board, would have captured&#xD;
them, despite their superiority in force. It was not to be.&#xD;
After doing all that men could do, we were at last compelled&#xD;
to surret der. We were brought into Portsmouth, and then&#xD;
suffered to depart on parole. Dear Blanche," continued the&#xD;
speaker, " may I not hope that your sweet smiles will make&#xD;
less cheerless my sojourn in a strange land ?"&#xD;
Blanche hid her face on his breast, but did not reply.&#xD;
"My own sweet Blanche," exclaimed Spencer, in low, trem-&#xD;
ulous tones, that thrilled to the inmost depth of his companion's&#xD;
soul, "by the love that you profess to feel for me, and by the&#xD;
vows that we have plighted to each other, I beseech you to&#xD;
answer me. I have a horse, and everything necessary for our&#xD;
journey, close at hand. Speak love, say, will you not be 'mine,&#xD;

peremptorily forbid you to hold further intercourse with this&#xD;
man, or even to think of him as a lover, again ?"&#xD;
The only reply of Blanche was a deep, convulsive sob.&#xD;
"And you, presumptuous boy," continued Sinclair, turning&#xD;
round to Spencer, "I should have thought the reception you&#xD;
met with when you were last here, would have been sufficient&#xD;
to deter you from ever again attempting a like outrage. Is it&#xD;
consistent, think you, with the character' of a gentleman or a&#xD;
man of honor, to steal thus like a thief into a man's dwelling,&#xD;
and endeavor to rob him of his most cherished treasure ?"&#xD;
"Sir 1" exclaimed Spencer, with a flushed face, and eyes&#xD;
flashing with anger, "this is a style of language, I allow no&#xD;
man' to use when addressing me. Do you know to whom you&#xD;
are speaking, sir ?"&#xD;
"Yes," answered Sinclair, calmly, "I do know. I believe&#xD;
I now address Charles Henry Seaham, Viscount Seaham and&#xD;
Dudley."&#xD;
"You do, sir," said Seaham, drawing himself up proudly.&#xD;
"And is the attempt to seduce a young and innocent girl&#xD;
from her home, a fit occupation for one of England's peers ?"&#xD;
asked Sinclair, fixing on the Viscount a look that made him&#xD;
bend rhis eyed in confusion on the floor.&#xD;
"By what right, sir, do you presume to address me thus?"'&#xD;
suddenly exclaimed Seaham, with an assumption of boldness&#xD;
he was far from feeling.^&#xD;
"By that of a father's, in respect to this girl, and that of an&#xD;
uncle, as applied to you," answered Sinclair.&#xD;
"Father !" exclaimed Blanche,. springing from the sofa in&#xD;
bewildered surprise.&#xD;
" Uncle 1" cried, the Viscount, 'bending on him a look of&#xD;
putzled inquiry.&#xD;
" Yes," replied Sinclair, "both. But refrain your astonish-&#xD;
ment, and sit down," he continued, "for I have that to tell you&#xD;
which will cause you far more surprise than this.'&#xD;

intenseness,, seated themselves again on the sofa; and the Re-&#xD;
cluse, having at length seemingly composed his thoughts to the&#xD;
task, sat down before them, and thus began the narrative of&#xD;
his crimes and woes:-&#xD;
"As you are no doubt aware," said he, addressing his speech&#xD;
to the Viscount, "your grandfather, the last Duke of Durham,&#xD;
had two sons-your father, the present duke, and myself. I&#xD;
was born just one year after Charles; and, though we always&#xD;
had the same tutors, were always treated the same, and had&#xD;
everything in common, it would have been impossible to have&#xD;
found two youths more dissimilat in habits and dispositions,&#xD;
than he and I. He resembled our mother--being gentle, timid,&#xD;
studious, and retiring. I, on the contrary, took after father---&#xD;
being impulsive, violent, and a slave to the most nngovernable&#xD;
passions. On returning from college, after completing our&#xD;
education, we stayed for some time at Castle Seaham, before&#xD;
starting on the continental tour-then, as now, considered the&#xD;
finishing touch to a gentleman's education. It was during this&#xD;
time that the seeds were sown which afterwards produced such&#xD;
bitter, bitter fruit. About two miles from Castle'Sdaham,&#xD;
stood a large mansion, or manor house, the residence of a Sir&#xD;
Thomas Dacres, the descendant of a family, which, though less&#xD;
ennobled than our own, was as ancient, and could boast of as&#xD;
many quarterings on the family shield.&#xD;
"Sir Thomas had been a widower for several years; but the&#xD;
loss of his wife was more than supplied by the presence and&#xD;
gentle ministering of his only daughter, Marion. It will be&#xD;
needless for me to describe the various attractions of Marion&#xD;
Dacres. Suflice it to say, that the graces of her mind were&#xD;
every way commensurate with those of her person, and that,&#xD;
in both respects, the heart had nothing to wish for more. Sir&#xD;
Thomas and his daughter were constant visitors at Castle Sea-&#xD;
ham; and being thus thrown continually into the presence of&#xD;
Marion, it was not long 'ere I learned to look upon bet' with&#xD;
other eyes than those of friendship. I loved her-purely,&#xD;

100            THE YANKEE MIDDY . OR'&#xD;
&#xD;
deeply, and devotedly loved her; and I soon discovered, by&#xD;
signs which lovers can alone perceive, that I was far from being&#xD;
an object of dislike to her. At last I told my love, and was&#xD;
made happy, if ever man was, by receiving in return the sweet&#xD;
assurance that I was as dear to her, as she to me. Shortly&#xD;
after this, my brother and I departed on our tour; but, although&#xD;
we very rarely, 'if ever, had secrets with which both were not&#xD;
acquainted, in this instance I refrained from telling him of my&#xD;
attachment to Marion Dacres; a circumstance that I have&#xD;
since bitterly regretted-for had I done so, it might have saved&#xD;
me from being the miserable and  heart-broken wretch that I&#xD;
am now. After remaining on the:continent for little more&#xD;
than a year, we returned to England, and I resumed, once&#xD;
more, my delightful intercourse with the too faithful Marion.&#xD;
But it seemed as if Fate had predestinated that our love should&#xD;
be crossed.&#xD;
"I had not been at home two months, ere my father-inform-&#xD;
ed me that he had procured me a captaincy in a-regiment then&#xD;
just on the point of starting for India ; adding, moreover, that&#xD;
as Charles was the heir of the dukedom, and consequently&#xD;
would be kept at home as much as possible, on my actions&#xD;
alone, the honor of adorning the family name with fresh laurels,&#xD;
depended. I distinguished myself in India, and gradually rose&#xD;
to the rank of colonel; but at last, during a skirmish with a&#xD;
large body of Affghans, being separated from my own men,&#xD;
I was taken prisoner, and carried to one of their mountain&#xD;
strongholds. I remained there for nearly five years; and was&#xD;
at last released on the cessation of hostilities between Affghan-&#xD;
istan and England.&#xD;
"On arriving once more in England, about the first news&#xD;
that I heard was that Marion Dacres was now the wife of my&#xD;
brother Charles! I leave you to imagine my feelings on hear-&#xD;
ing this intelligence.&#xD;
"For some time I resolutely refrained from visiting my bro-&#xD;

and I went. Luckily, my brother was away in London, at the&#xD;
time I first paid my respects to his wife, or our mutual and&#xD;
uncontrollable emotions would, have at once shown him that&#xD;
the feelings of other days were yet as powerful as ever in our&#xD;
breasts.&#xD;
"Marion informed  ne that it was .about a year after my&#xD;
departure to India ;that my brother first became a suitor for&#xD;
her hand; and though--as she assured me, with tears in her&#xD;
eyes-she had repulsed his addresses for upwards of a year,&#xD;
she had at last, through the threats and entreaties of her father,&#xD;
been compelled to accept him  as a husband ; nor would she&#xD;
.have succumbed then, but that ,a report of my death had ap-&#xD;
peared in the news from India.&#xD;
"-After this, my visits to Elmwood, my brother's residence,&#xD;
were made with daily regularity.. Would that I could say&#xD;
they were of guiltless intent ; but alas! they were not., Even&#xD;
in my first visit, I had'perceived that, despite her four years of&#xD;
wedded life, or the fact of being the mother of a fine little boy,&#xD;
the heart of Marion was yet as: much mine, as ever it was:&#xD;
and on-this structure I reared the structure of my guilty hopes&#xD;
and wishes.&#xD;
"At.length, in an unguarded hour, Marion forgot her mar-&#xD;

ment, happiness fled for ever from our breasts ; for even when&#xD;

'Through the treachery of ,the only person (the waiting-&#xD;
maid of Marion) whom We had trusted with our guilty secret,&#xD;
my brother was at length informed of the infidelity of his.wife.&#xD;

102              THE YANKEE MIDDY ; OR&#xD;
"Marion was on the point of becoming a mother when the&#xD;
duel took place ; and having, despite all efforts made to hinder,&#xD;
her, become aware of what had taken place, she was seized&#xD;
with the pangs of premature labor, and died in giving birth to&#xD;
a daughter.&#xD;
"The remainder of my sad tale may be summed up in a&#xD;
few words. Having, through a large bribe, obtained possession&#xD;
of Marion's infant, I immediately embarked with it to America,&#xD;
where, under my present assumed name, I have since resided.&#xD;
Since then, until the present night, I have never spoken to&#xD;
man or woman.&#xD;
"Even when I first beheld you," continued the Recluse,&#xD;
addressing the Viscount, "as you lay apparently dead among&#xD;
the rocks where the waves had thrown you, there was a some-&#xD;
thing in your countenance that strongly reminded me of a face&#xD;
I had seen before ; but, on the afternoon that I met you as I&#xD;
was entering the garden, your likeness to my brother was so&#xD;
palpably distinct, that for a moment I thought it was he him-&#xD;
self who stood before me.&#xD;
"Â«Through the medium of a letter, I informed this foolish girl&#xD;
that a union with you was impossible ; but with what salutary&#xD;
effect, the adventure of the following night may best answer.&#xD;
On that occasion, I own I let my passions overpower my rea-&#xD;
son ; but I need not tell you now, that we are not at all times&#xD;
masters of ourselves."&#xD;
For some time after the Recluse had finished the sad recital&#xD;
of his woes, a profound silence reigned in the room, which&#xD;
was only broken at intervals by the deep, convulsive sobs of&#xD;
Blanche; as she sat crouching, as though to shrink from her&#xD;
very self, at one end of the sofa. At length the Viscount arose,&#xD;
and, advancing to the grief-stricken Blanche, he took her hand,&#xD;
and said :&#xD;
"Dear Blanche, whatever may have been the misfortunes&#xD;
and crimes of our parents, believe me when I say, that I shall&#xD;
ever bear towards you, no other feelings than those of the ten-&#xD;

derest regard and love. Dear sister-though such at the cost&#xD;
of my mother's honor-let me clasp you once more in my arms&#xD;
before I bid you an adieu for ever."&#xD;
Blanche flung herself wildly into his arms, where for some&#xD;
time she clung, weeping as though her heart would break.&#xD;
She could not, for worlds, have uttered a word-her emotions&#xD;
were too powerful for that. At length the Viscount gently dis-&#xD;
engaged her arms from his neck, and placed her on the sofa ;&#xD;
then turning to where his uncle was pacing backwards and&#xD;
forwards in moody silence, he said :&#xD;
"As for you, uncle, God may forgive you, but I never can l"&#xD;
and turning on his heel, he abruptly left the room.&#xD;
On arriving at the glade, where, under the care of Broom,&#xD;
the horses had been left, the Viscount found them still tethered&#xD;
there, and quietly browsing the herbage around; while stretch-&#xD;
ed at full length at the foot of a tree, lay Broom, apparently&#xD;
asleep.&#xD;
Stooping down, the Viscount shook him roughly, and de-&#xD;
manded what had become of Agnes. Receiving no answer,&#xD;
he bent his face closely to that of the supposed sleeper; then&#xD;
uttering a loud exclamation of horror and surprise, he sprang&#xD;
to his feet, and hastily mounting his horse, he drove his spur&#xD;
deep into its flanks, and without so much as looking behind&#xD;
him, fled swiftly from the spot.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
TAKING AN ENEMY AT CLOSE QUARTERS.&#xD;
A LITTLE more than a month hath elapsed since the events&#xD;
last narrated took place. And now, when we again proceed&#xD;
with the thread of our narrative, we will once more conduct&#xD;
the reader 'on board the Invincible, as, held by a single hawser,&#xD;
she is lying within less than half a mile of the port of Lunen-&#xD;
burg, Nova-Scotia.&#xD;
It is a dark and cloudy night, moonless and starless; and&#xD;
the wind, with that strange, moaning, whistling sound, which'&#xD;
generally prognosticates its rising to a tempest, is sweeping in&#xD;
heavy gusts Over the black, pitchy-like sturface off the sea-&#xD;
ever and anon breaking the summit of some huge wave, into&#xD;
a mass of snowy foam.&#xD;
Despitetthe threatening aspect of the weather, however,j/four&#xD;
of the Invincible's boats have : been lowered over her sides,&#xD;
and are now being rapidly filled with men; and while they are&#xD;
busily engaged embarking, and handing down into the boats,&#xD;
boarding-pikes, cutlasses, muskets, hand-grenades, and other&#xD;
necessaries for making "an impression" on an enemy, we will&#xD;
take the opportunity of informing the reader of their desti-&#xD;
nation.&#xD;
As the Invincible, a little after sunrise, was cruising some&#xD;
leagues from Cape Sable, she had sighted a sail, and imme-&#xD;
diately given chase ; but though during the continuance of the&#xD;
chase, she had gradually lessened the distance between her&#xD;
and the stranger, the latter had been able to reach Lunenburg&#xD;
before her pursuer had come within shot-range; and as she&#xD;
&#xD;
"+I&#xD;
i&#xD;
A&#xD;
"4&#xD;
r4&#xD;
&#xD;
lay directly under the guns of the fort. Captaii Manly had&#xD;
not deemed it advisable,wiuring daylight, to make any further&#xD;
attempt to capture her.:&#xD;
No sooner, however, had the shades of night, descended,&#xD;
wrapping all in a mantle of impenetrable darkness, than the&#xD;
Invincible Was run closely in shore, and the boats manned;&#xD;
for Captain Manly had determined, if possible, to capture or&#xD;
destroy the Englishman where he lay.&#xD;
"Are you all ready, men ?" said the Captain, as he now&#xD;
descended into the largest cutter, and took his seat in:.the&#xD;
stern-sheets.&#xD;
"Yes, sir, all ready," was the answer from each of the lieu-&#xD;
tenants in command of the other three cutters.&#xD;
"Then give way with a will, my lads," exclaimed the cap-&#xD;
tain ; and simultaneous with the order, the sweeps ;sank in the&#xD;
water, and the four boats, like impatient racers, shot forwards&#xD;
from the side of the Invincible. As they thus silently and&#xD;
swiftly approached the corvette, (for to that class, did the Eng-&#xD;
lish ship belong), Captain Manly made a signal for the other&#xD;
boats to draw near his own; and when this was done, he&#xD;
proceeded to give the following orders to each of their com-&#xD;
manders:&#xD;
"You, Mr. Philips, and you, Mr. Morrill, with your respect.&#xD;
tive crews, will board him on the weather side; whilst I and&#xD;
Mr. Weston here, in the pinnace, will attack him on the larr&#xD;
board quarter. I think I need scarcely rentind you,' that our&#xD;
success in a great nieasure depends on the silence and seereey&#xD;
of our' first approach; your own good sense will tell yoi, that&#xD;
in attacking an enemy's ship under cover of xiight, and beneath&#xD;
the guns of a shore battery, DIsCRETION will be the better part&#xD;
of valOr. No fire-arms must be used, if possible; but if:that&#xD;
'  cannot be done, our only alternative will 'be to make as short&#xD;
work of it as possible-blow her up, and get safely off again:&#xD;
and now, men, give way, steadily, altogether, and with. a will-&#xD;
pull, men, pull'!"&#xD;

THE YANKEE MIDDY ; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
Their close proximity to the enemy hindered the crews&#xD;
from;expressing their enthusiasm ; but, bending again to their,&#xD;
oars, they sent the boats speeding over the billows with incredi-&#xD;
ble celerity.&#xD;
The oars of each boat had been muffed, and the night being&#xD;
of tomb-like darkness, they succeeded in getting within a few&#xD;
yards of the corvette, when suddenly the words- Who goes ?"&#xD;
saluted their ears.&#xD;
"Who goes ?-or I fire 1" again shouted the sentinels, with&#xD;
startling emphasis, as no answer was returned to their first&#xD;
summons; but, on the contrary, the advancing boats only&#xD;
seeming to double their exertions to reach the ship. Still-no&#xD;
answer; and both of the sentinels raising their muskets, fired&#xD;
at the same moment--the flashes of their pieces showing to&#xD;
their astonished gaze, four boats filled with men, all armed to&#xD;
the teeth, and close alongside of the ship. In another minute&#xD;
the Americans, with their cutlasses held between their teeth,&#xD;
were scrambling, with the activity of monkeys, up the sides of&#xD;
the Englishman.&#xD;
So secure had the British commander deemed himself-thus&#xD;
laid, as it were, under the very mouths of the cannon of the&#xD;
fort, that, accompanied by his first lieutenant and a barge-crew,&#xD;
he had gone on shore to spend the evening in conviviality with&#xD;
the commandant of the fort, leaving the ship under the care of&#xD;
the second lieutenant, a mere youth. This circumstance at&#xD;
once told. powerfully in favor of the Americans; and, adding&#xD;
to this the fact that the greatest part of the crew were sound&#xD;
asleep in their hammocks at the moment of the attack, the&#xD;
'esistaide which they no. meet with was of such little moment,&#xD;
and was 'so easily overcome, that in less than ten minutes&#xD;
after they wvere first hailed by the sentinels, they were com'-&#xD;
plete masters of the: ship; and the Princess Charlotte-- cor-&#xD;
vette of twenty-four twelve-pound' carronades-had passed&#xD;
from the hands of the minions of King George, to those of&#xD;
Captain Manly and his gallant YAcKEE TARS.&#xD;

THE TWO FRIGATES.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
Short as the conflict was, however, the fortunate stars of our&#xD;
hero afforded him an opportunity of rendering his commander&#xD;
a debtor to him for his life. The circumstance was thus.&#xD;
Drawn up around the foot of the' foremast, a body-of the&#xD;
English sailors fought for some time' like lions at bay ; 'and&#xD;
Captain Manly, having made himself'master of the' after-part&#xD;
of the ship, coming forward and seeing them thus obstinately&#xD;
refusing to give way, or cry for quarter, cutlass in hand, leaped&#xD;
forward into the midst of the melee. At the moment, however,&#xD;
of his springing, his foot slipped, having trod in a pool of blood&#xD;
on the deck, and he fell just as one of the Englishmen had&#xD;
made a blow at his head with his cutlass. Our hero was close&#xD;
at the captain's elbow at the time, and, seeing the imminent&#xD;
risk of his commander, at the peril of his own life, sprang on&#xD;
the Briton, and seizing him by the throat, compressed his&#xD;
windpipe with such a vice-like grip, that, on leaving loose about&#xD;
a minute after, the man dropped on the deck a livid' and dis-&#xD;
torted corpse. Shortly after this, seeing the rest of their com.&#xD;
rades prisoners, the British threw down their arms and called&#xD;
quarter. it was granted; and they were 'sent below, and the&#xD;
hatches fastened down upon them.&#xD;
Captain Manly had given orders shortly after he had leached&#xD;
the deck of the corvette, that both her hawsers should be cut.&#xD;
This having been done, and the topsails loosened and 'braced&#xD;
to the wind, and two of the Invincible's boats sent ahead 'to&#xD;
tow, the Princess Charlotte began now to 'head slowly toward&#xD;
the sea ; and gathering headway as she proceeded, it was not&#xD;
long before the battle-lantern at the stern of the Invincible was&#xD;
seen gleaming through the gloom like 'a star, a little' on 'their&#xD;
weather bow.&#xD;
The report and' flash of the sentinel's muskets had acquainted&#xD;
the garrison in the fort that something unusual was taking&#xD;
place on board the corvette ; but what it was they were un-&#xD;
able for some time to make out. At length, however, by&#xD;
means of a rocket sent in the direction of the ship, they were&#xD;

enabled by its momentary glare :to .form a shrewd guess at&#xD;
what was going ori, and immediately proceeded to act accord-&#xD;
ingly.&#xD;
A body of men from the fort, with two carronades, the barge&#xD;
crew of the Princess Charlotte and their two officers, were&#xD;
instantly embarked onboard ,a small coaster then lying in the&#xD;
harbor ; and crowding all sail on her that they could, endeav-&#xD;
ored to reach the corvette in time to prevent her diminished&#xD;
crew from being overpowered.&#xD;
The attempt proved fruitless. .. The rincess~ Charlotte had&#xD;
already left her anchorage, and was heading away at a swift&#xD;
rate out to sea, where they knew it would only be running into&#xD;
an American prison to followj her, The English commander,&#xD;
therefore, half mad through vexation, had toreturn once more&#xD;
to his boon companion, the commandant of the fort, a disap-&#xD;
pointed. and sHIIPLEss marl. But,;however through the aid of&#xD;
a couple of bottles of "old Port with a crust,".he soon forgot&#xD;
the tarnish his laurels had sustained;, and his last, toast, given&#xD;

CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
COME HASTE TO THE WEDDING.&#xD;
ONE afternoon, about two months after Peace had been&#xD;
declared between the United States of America and Great&#xD;
Britain, a "solitary horseman" might have been seen riding&#xD;
leisurely down the road which led close by Elm Farm.&#xD;
The horseman was dressed in a suit of what once had been&#xD;
"clerkly black," but which now exhibited unmistakable evi-&#xD;
dence of having sadly "run to seed."  He seemed to be about&#xD;
forty, while from the meek, placii expression of his face, and&#xD;
his calm, dignified movements, an observer would at once&#xD;
have set him down as a minister of the gospel, and such he&#xD;
was.&#xD;
As the reverend gentleman was thus riding leisurely onward,&#xD;
on turning an.angle in the lane about half way drven, he sud-'&#xD;
denly encountered a tall, burly looking man, who was advanc-&#xD;
ing up the road at a running pace.&#xD;
"I say, parson," exclaimed the new comer, stopping as soon&#xD;
as he beheld the horseman, "I'll be gawl darned if it aint tew&#xD;
bad, keepin' us waitin' most o' tew hours for you. What on&#xD;
airth has kept yew so all-fired long ?"&#xD;
"I am very sorry, Mr. Brown, to have' kept your young&#xD;
master waiting, and-"&#xD;
"Me and Sal, and the niggers, tow," exclaimed our old&#xD;
friend Asa, interrupting without ceremony the reverend gen-&#xD;
tleman.&#xD;
"Yes, Mr. Brown," meekly continued the man of God, "I&#xD;

THE YANKEE MIDDY; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
am very sorry to have kept you all waiting, but really I could&#xD;
not help it. As I was on the point of setting forth on my jour-&#xD;
ney hitherward, I was called upon to administer the consolation&#xD;
of religion to a man who had been suddenly taken ill, as he was&#xD;
on the point of leaving Wells, whither he had been on some&#xD;
business of importance. He told me that his dwelling.place&#xD;
was nigh unto Elm Farm, and gave me this packet,"-and the&#xD;
reverend gentleman showed' Asa a sealed letter-" to give to a&#xD;
maiden named Blanche Wilton, whom he said I should find at&#xD;
Elm Farm."&#xD;
"What kinder chap was he ?" eagerly demanded Asa.&#xD;
"A tall, black-haired, sallow-complexioned man, with a mole&#xD;
on his left temple," was the reply.&#xD;
"It's him, gawl darn my eyes ef it aint," exclaimed Asa,&#xD;
bringing the palm of his hand on his thigh, and producing a&#xD;
sound nearly as loud as that of a musket. "I thought so, by&#xD;
Jerewsalem, when yew first spoke of him. I say, parson,"&#xD;
continued. Asa, laying his hand on the reverend gentleman's&#xD;
saddle, and looking at him with an earnest expression on his&#xD;
facet "jest say nothing about this until after yew hey married&#xD;
us ; for yew see, that chap what has just kicked the bucket,&#xD;
was the father of Harry's intended bride. So, ef yew tell them&#xD;
before yew begin tew splice us, there'll be an all-fired flare up,&#xD;
and nobody married. So jest say nothin at all, until arter."&#xD;
The clergyman, seeing how intensely in earnest the intended&#xD;
Benedick before him was, at last consented to postpone the&#xD;
delivery of his sad npews until after, as Asa expressed it, he had&#xD;
"spliced" the three couple ; and this arrangement having been&#xD;
amicably. settled between them, the parson and Asa set for-&#xD;
ward at a quickened pace to Elm Farm. As he had been both&#xD;
long and anxiously expected by the various candidates for the&#xD;
fetters of Hymen, the reverend gentleman had no sooner&#xD;
arrived at the farm, than he had to proceed "  to business" at&#xD;
once. Our hero and the blushing Blanche were the first couple&#xD;
united. Then followed Asa and Sal, who by the bye, was a&#xD;
&#xD;
110&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;
stout buxom young lass, who had come to Elm Farm a few&#xD;
months before in the capacity of servant ; and having by her&#xD;
charms smitten our friend:Asa with "Love's sore paine," as&#xD;
old Spencer hath it, Asa had found thatnothing but taking her&#xD;
"for better or for worse" would cure him; he had therefore&#xD;
popped the question, and been accepted.&#xD;
The third couple were Marc Anthony and his sable inamo-&#xD;
rato Juliet ; for the sake of whose smiles, as already known to&#xD;
the reader, Marc had on a former occasion perilled life and&#xD;
limb, a passage of ARngr with the namesake of the illustrious&#xD;
Roman, Caesar Augustus.&#xD;
We will leave to the reader, the task of imagining the festivi-&#xD;
ties and merriment that closed this eventful day at Elm Farm ;&#xD;
and will merely add in conclusion, that old Dame Weston de-&#xD;
clared on her honor, "that, never since she was a girl about&#xD;
fifteen, at which time she was married to Farmer Weston,&#xD;
had the old roof-tree of Elm Farm seen anything of the like&#xD;
before."&#xD;
Agnes Weston was never married ; for, although she had&#xD;
two or three "very good offers," she refused them all, and&#xD;
clung with as much tenacity to the memory of her love for this&#xD;
unworthy object, as the grape-vine clings to the trunks of trees&#xD;
in some of the primeval woods of America. She lived about&#xD;
five years after the marriage of her brother; then sank quietly&#xD;
and calmly into the peaceful and everlasting sleep of death.&#xD;
On the conclusion of the war between England and the&#xD;
States, Viscount Seaham returned home; but he had not been&#xD;
in England three months, ere quarreling with an officer belong-&#xD;
ing to the army, a duel was the consequence, and the Viscount,&#xD;
at the first fire, received his adversary's ball in his heart; thus&#xD;
closing a life of dissipation and crime, in a violent death,&#xD;
caused through his own ungovernable passions.&#xD;
After attaining to the rank of captain, on his father's death,&#xD;
our hero, like Epammonidas, in the days of yore, turned his&#xD;
sword into a pruning-hook, and his spear, to a garden rod ; or,&#xD;

&#xD;
There were plainly two alternatives before him:&#xD;
one was to go and seek his fortune elsewhere-&#xD;
the other was to remain in the village and&#xD;
become a farm-laborer. He would have done&#xD;
the former, had not there been a certain tie&#xD;
which bound him to Oakleigh: and so lie&#xD;
adopted the latter alternative. He had since&#xD;
the death of his benefactress occupied a lodging&#xD;
-that is to say, one small room at the little&#xD;
house of Mr. Bates the barber; and he had&#xD;
worked for Sir Archibald Redburn,'of Redburn&#xD;
Manor. He bore a most excellent character it&#xD;
the village, alttoughi he was generally considered&#xD;
to be his own enemy it one respect : namely,&#xD;
that lie had a spiit somewhat iupatient of control,&#xD;
and never crimged nor played a fawning part&#xD;
towards the baronet or the clergyman, both of&#xD;
whom were such high and mighty people in&#xD;
the eyes of those humble villagers. We may&#xD;
add that the blackened rumis alluded to at the&#xD;
opemnig of our tale were the remains of the&#xD;
unfortunate Mrs. Grant's cottage.&#xD;
The reader has now learnt as much as it is&#xD;
necessaryy fmr us to tell hiit in respect to Fred-&#xD;
erick Lonsdale, whom we must accordingly ac-&#xD;
company in his walk along the bank of the little&#xD;
river. He soon reached the wood ; and still&#xD;
following the course of the stream beneath the&#xD;
shade of the over-arching trees, ie in a few&#xD;
nuiutes reached tie rude bridge which spanned&#xD;
the stream. ''here he was very shortly joined&#xD;
by a young wonma  of whom we must say soie-&#xD;
thimg. Lucy Davis was the daughter of Sir&#xD;
Archibald ledburn's bailiff. She was twenty&#xD;
years of age, and exceedmngly beautiful. Tall&#xD;
and well made, there was a certain air of&#xD;
geitility about Lucy which raised her above the&#xD;
ordinary average of the rustic maidens, as F'red-&#xD;
erick himself was superior to the peasant youths&#xD;
of the district. She had dark brown hair of&#xD;
singular ichness and luxuriance: her eyes were&#xD;
of the deepest blue, and the brows handsomely&#xD;
arched.  ''he hues of health were upon her&#xD;
cheeks ; and the smiles of innocent happiness&#xD;
were generally upon her lips.  Sweeter lips&#xD;
were never seet ; and when parting, they dis-&#xD;
played a faultless set of teeth. She was dressed&#xD;
wit h the utmost neatness, but plaimly aiid simply :&#xD;
yet did her apparel set off the adorable cuitours&#xD;
of her shape more attractively than the richest&#xD;
rannent could have (done. Though what may&#xD;
be termed a well-grown young woman, her&#xD;
synunetry was perfect,-the slope of the shioul-&#xD;
ders, the fullness of the bust, the slenderness of&#xD;
the waist, antd the sweeping length of limb, all&#xD;
comlining torender her a model for a sculptor's&#xD;
study.&#xD;
Such was Lucy Davis. And now the reader&#xD;
can be no longer at a loss to understand the&#xD;
nature of that secret tie which had bound Fred-&#xD;
erick Lonsdale to the village. He and Lucy&#xD;
had long loved each other. In childhood they&#xD;
were frequently playmates ; and as they grew&#xD;
up, the friendship of earlier years ripened into a&#xD;
smicere and profound -attachment. But where-&#xD;
fore have we spoken of the tie binding Frederick&#xD;
to Oakleigh as a secret ote?  Because he had&#xD;
never avowed his love for Lucy to her father.&#xD;
Mr. Davi-s, being comparatively in goodh circunm-&#xD;
6tanices. had loftier views ott behalf of his !&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
daughter: indeed his ambition had soared so&#xD;
high that he had flattered himself her exceeding&#xD;
beauty might even captivate Gerald Redburn,&#xD;
the Baronet's only son and heir. Of course, in&#xD;
making this calculation, Mr. Davis knew perfect-&#xD;
ly well that Sir Archibald would never willingly&#xD;
consent to such a match: but the estates were&#xD;
entailed, and when young Gerald should come&#xD;
of age, he might do as he liked and snap his&#xD;
fingers at his father. So thought the bailiff:&#xD;
and from these simple facts the reader may at&#xD;
once gather th at lie was an unprincipled and&#xD;
an unscrupulous man. Such indeed ie was ;&#xD;
and being of so designing a character, was not&#xD;
without a consummate dissimulation to conceal&#xD;
it. He was a widower-Lucy was his only&#xD;
child--and he hoped that by seeing her become&#xD;
"a lady," he might, with a sort of borrowed&#xD;
reflection of the lustre of rank, come to dub&#xD;
himself "a gentleman."&#xD;
On the evening in question, Frederick Lons-&#xD;
dale and Lucy Davis met at the bridge a little&#xD;
before the sunset hour-that hour which exer-&#xD;
cises a two-fold influence upon the minds of&#xD;
lovers, either lulling them into a serenity of bliss&#xD;
when their loves are prosperous, or else weighiing&#xD;
upon them with a saddening despondency when&#xD;
the course of their affection runs not smooth.&#xD;
Yes--they met at that bridge where they had&#xD;
often and often met before, and at that same&#xD;
hoar which had likewise so frequently marked&#xD;
these past meetingsI. it was with a light elastic&#xD;
step and with smiles upon her beauteous counte-&#xD;
nantc-, that Lucy tripped across the bridge to&#xD;
joim her lover ; and in the first gush of pleasure&#xD;
at the meeting, she did not perceive the sadness&#xD;
which sat upon his brow. Perhaps, too, his&#xD;
countenance suddenly brightened up as he folded&#xD;
her to his arms: but the transient sense of joy at&#xD;
thus straining his well-beloved to his heart, was&#xD;
quickly succeeded by a feeling of bitterness int&#xD;
consequence of what was lying heavy upou his&#xD;
soul.&#xD;
Hand in hand they walked along the baik of&#xD;
the river, proceeding deeper into the wood ; atnd&#xD;
any one who had beheld them then, would have&#xD;
at once arrived at the conclusion that there was&#xD;
ai admirable fitness in the union of this hand-&#xD;
some couple. rT'he coarse garments of Frederick&#xD;
would have been lost sight of in the contempla-&#xD;
tion of his fine form, his upright gait, his manly&#xD;
walk, and his intellectual countetnmttce tnd in-&#xD;
deed, if he had found time to put on his Sunday&#xD;
garb ere comlring to this appointment, there would&#xD;
have been no circumstance, so far as thie out-&#xD;
ward appearance of the two lovers went, to&#xD;
raise a suspicion that there was an inequality of&#xD;
social grades which appeared to present an in--&#xD;
superable bar to their union.&#xD;
They had not proceeded very far, when Lucy,&#xD;
im making soie observation, bent her beautiful&#xD;
eyes upon Frederick, and was struck by the sad-&#xD;
nes of hi. looks. She suddenly stoppethomrt&#xD;
im what she was saying,--stopped short also on&#xD;
the bank of the stream; And gazing upon him in-&#xD;
silent earnestness for nearly a niinute, said in&#xD;
tones as liquid as the musical flow of the crystal&#xD;
watersthemselves, "Frederick-dear Frederick,&#xD;
something line occurred I You ame unhappy I"&#xD;
"'I cannot conceal it from you, be ved Lucy,n&#xD;

embrace. At that instant an ejaculation ofI&#xD;
mingled astonishment and rage fell upon their&#xD;
ears: and starting asunder, they stood in a kind&#xD;
of guilty confusion in the presence of the indi-&#xD;
vidual who had just emerged from the depths&#xD;
of the wood. This was Mr. Davis, Lucy's fa-&#xD;
ther,&#xD;
"Vile deceitful girl !" he exclaimed: "is it for&#xD;
this that those frequent evening walks of your's&#xD;
have been taken? But you, villain," lie added,&#xD;
now turning his wratlhfal looks upon Lonsdale,.&#xD;
"how dare you thus seek to rob me of my daugh-&#xD;
ter t"v&#xD;
"Mr. Davis," was the immediate auswergiven&#xD;
by Frederick, who quickly recovered his pres-&#xD;
ence of mind, "it is an honest love I bear your&#xD;
daughter-a love which, mutually felt, has ri-&#xD;
pened from our childhood's years--"&#xD;
"No more !"ejaculated the bailiff, the naturally&#xD;
harsh tones of his voice sounding more sternly&#xD;
harsh than ever: "not another word upon the&#xD;
subject 1 Come hither, girl :"-and clutching&#xD;
his daughter violently by the arm, he drew her&#xD;
towards him. " You will come home with me,&#xD;
and I will take care to put an end to your rain-&#xD;
bles. As for you, Lonsdale, I have but a few&#xD;
words to say. I was proceeding to your lodg-&#xD;
ing for the purpose of telling you that by Sir&#xD;
Archibald Redburn's coniunaud you are to seek&#xD;
employment elsewhere. Here is a fortnight's&#xD;
wages for you; and the sooner you get out of&#xD;
the village, the better."&#xD;
As line thus spoke, the bailiff tossed some sil-&#xD;
ver in half-crowns at the feet of Frederick, who&#xD;
was standing about three yards distant : and&#xD;
then suddenly turning round, he dragged his&#xD;
daughter away with him. She threw a look&#xD;
upon Frederick which more eloquently than&#xD;
words could have done, seemed to remind him&#xD;
of the vow that had so solemnly passed her&#xD;
lips ; and ere she turned her head again, shie&#xD;
caught in mute response the dimness of his part-&#xD;
ing smile.&#xD;
He remained rivetted to the spot, gazing after&#xD;
the retreating forms of the bailiff and his daugh-&#xD;
ter : then, as they speedily disappeared from&#xD;
his view, he turned abruptly round and plunged&#xD;
into the thickest of the wood, there to give way&#xD;
to the auugni-ih that filled hus heart. But the&#xD;
moitey which Davis haid so countemuptuously&#xD;
ilung dowui, was left unheeded upon ithe bauk.&#xD;
CHAPTER     III.&#xD;
TinE ALE-HOUSE PARLOL&#xD;
TI was nine o'clock--the blind was drawn&#xD;
down in the parlor of the Royal Oak-the can-&#xD;
dies were lighted upon the table-and there&#xD;
was a much larger attendance of guests than&#xD;
usual. At least a dozen persons were seated&#xD;
around the room, pufling their pipes, andc enjoy-&#xD;
ing Mr. Bushell's good ale. This individual&#xD;
himself sat on one side of the fire-place-his ac-&#xD;
eustomted coriier( luring the twenty years he hd&#xD;
bceen landlord of the Roval Oak ; and although&#xD;
there was no fire in t'he grate in that warm&#xD;
-rinr' ser#, "  -a  host" nevertheless re&#xD;
&#xD;
mained faithful to his wonted location. Oppo-&#xD;
site to him, in the other corner, sat Sergeant&#xD;
Langley-the object of all interest and the&#xD;
cynosare of attraction. Prim and stately after&#xD;
his own fashion, the sergeant could not possibly&#xD;
unbend in respect to his body, however much&#xD;
he might in the gravity of his looks or the&#xD;
pompous severity of his speech. We have al-&#xD;
ready said he was a tall and somewhat stoutly&#xD;
built man: we may add that he had a red&#xD;
face-hair cropped quite short, and deficient on&#xD;
the upper part of the forehead-and   snall&#xD;
twinkling gray eyes, which, if closely looked&#xD;
into, had a cunning, disagreeable, and even rep-&#xD;
tile-like expression. He had very little whis-&#xD;
kers: and being an infantry soldier, word no&#xD;
inoustache. His age appeared to be about five-&#xD;
and-forty : but it might very well have been&#xD;
three or four years nore,-for lie was a man&#xD;
who evidently wore well.&#xD;
The sergeant was smoking his pipe, but all&#xD;
the time holding forth with so little internis-&#xD;
sion, that the volatile and bustling barber, Mr.&#xD;
Bates, could scarcely manage to get in a word&#xD;
edgeways. There was something supremely&#xD;
ludicrous in the attitude and look of the little&#xD;
shaver, as lie sat bending forward on the edge&#xD;
of his chair, with eyes as keenly fixed upon&#xD;
Sergeant Langley as if'it were a cat watching -&#xD;
a mouse: but Mr. Bates was watching for the&#xD;
slightest pause in the soldier's discourse that&#xD;
might atford him an opportunity of giving ut-&#xD;
terance to his own opinion. Indeed, so excru-&#xD;
ciating was the anxiety of Barber Bates to get&#xD;
in a word, that his half-smoked pipe had been&#xD;
suffered to go out and remain idle in his hand,&#xD;
while his pint of ale stood also untouched on&#xD;
the table before him. It was evident too, that&#xD;
Sergeant Langley was quite aware of his new&#xD;
friend's intention of pouncing as it were upon&#xD;
the conversation, and the tomnent he got a fair&#xD;
gripe, monopolizing it all to himself: fur the&#xD;
wily soldier studiously avoided giving the bar-&#xD;
ber any such chance.&#xD;
The butcher, the baker, the general-dealer,&#xD;
the tailor, the shoemaker, the parish clerk, the&#xD;
sexton, and the other leading men of the village,&#xD;
were all assembled on the occasion ; and the&#xD;
greater portion of them were listening with&#xD;
wide-open eyes and pricked-up ears to the&#xD;
muarvllc-us stories that the sergeant was telling&#xD;
them. Of course Mr. Langley had a particular&#xD;
object to serve;- and he managed matters with&#xD;
wonderful tact and astuteness. He had to beat&#xD;
down the prejudices that existed against a&#xD;
soldier's life-to make the sense of its dangers&#xD;
merge into a feeling of patriotic enthusiasm--to&#xD;
gloss over its privatitns, its vicissitudes, and its&#xD;
degiading punishments--and in short, toc reate&#xD;
a paradise where the previous impression was&#xD;
that a dreary desert existed. Of course the&#xD;
sergeant could not deal in truths while thus&#xD;
expatiating; and to say that his imagiination&#xD;
- was largely' drawn upon, would only be to tell&#xD;
the reader something already suspected. There&#xD;
is a comnno phrase about  shooting with the&#xD;
long bow ;" but certainly Sergeant Langley&#xD;
nt mionly shot with one of the longest bows over&#xD;

. without the least clumsimness or want of dex.-&#xD;

14                    THE SOLDIER'S WIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
RATHER AND DAUGHTER.&#xD;
PETER Davis, the father of the beautiful&#xD;
Lucy, was a man of about fifty-five years of&#xD;
age-of middle stature, not stout, but very&#xD;
strongly built-and possessed of great physical&#xD;
strerniglh. He had coarse features, and a pair of&#xD;
exceedingly large ears, which even if his courie&#xD;
narnce had been the handsomest in the world&#xD;
wcotl have been a frightful disfigurement to&#xD;
his head. His hair, once dark, was now of an&#xD;
iron gray : it was quite straight, very thick, and&#xD;
was brushed upright above his forehead. He&#xD;
had dark whiskers, very shaggyeye-brows, and&#xD;
small eyes of a (heel) greenish cilor. There were&#xD;
many hard lines across his forehead andi about&#xD;
his mouth, which to the skilful physiognmionst&#xD;
denoted strong passions as well as a severe na-&#xD;
ture ;umd a resolute firmniess of purpose inu re-&#xD;
spect to whatever he undertook. His voice was&#xD;
harsh and disagreeable : his manner was usually&#xD;
cold, reserved, and conveying the impression of&#xD;
a stern, implacable disposition.&#xD;
It has already been said that he was a&#xD;
widower; but we may here observe that only&#xD;
four or five years had elapsed since his first wife&#xD;
died, and thus Lucy had enjoyed-the benefit of&#xD;
a mother's care during that period of iufanicy&#xD;
and girlhood when such tender supervision was&#xD;
to essentidly necessary. And tender that _sn-&#xD;
pervisioin had been inl this instance : for Mrs.&#xD;
Davis was a most amiable, excellent, and kind-&#xD;
hearted woman, beloved by all who knew her.&#xD;
She had _belonged to a family which, after seeing&#xD;
prosperous times, had become reduced in cir-&#xD;
cumstances ; and thus she had received a good&#xD;
education. 'The poverty to which her relatives&#xD;
were brought down, had compelled her to"ac-&#xD;
cept the offer of Peter Davis, who was already&#xD;
a well-to-do person; and though the heart's at-&#xD;
fectioi had nothing to do with this marriage, yet&#xD;
the young woman accepted her destiny with re-&#xD;
signation, if not with cheerfulness, and made a&#xD;
most exemplary wife. Lucy received all her&#xD;
education f'rothis excellent mother ; and hence&#xD;
the superiority of our heroine's acquirements,&#xD;
manners, and tastes over the genetahity of the&#xD;
rustic nmaidens of the district.&#xD;
Peter Davis hiad not made either a bad hus-&#xD;
band, nor as yet a bad father. He was utterly&#xD;
incapable of any feeling so noble as a warmth af-&#xD;
fection: but at the same time lie was iot a man&#xD;
whino showed the natural severity of his disposi-&#xD;
tion or the harshness of his temper without a&#xD;
cause. ie was not malignant unless provoked,&#xD;
and would not actually travel out of his way&#xD;
to exemplify his tyranmical character. Forbear-&#xD;
ance with such a mant is a sort of negative vir&#xD;
tue; and thus his home was not rendered mum-&#xD;
happy through huiself. His wife, having well&#xD;
understood his character, had yielded to hint m&#xD;
all things; so that there had been little to&#xD;
trouble their domestic peace. Lucy was like-&#xD;
wise of an amiable disposition, and simcerely&#xD;
loving heir father, did her best to make his home&#xD;
happy. In all things had she proved docile,&#xD;
-r'' t  ''  tent-save and except im that&#xD;
&#xD;
one instance, where the most submissive and&#xD;
tractable of children will at times rebel against&#xD;
the known wishes or expressed mandates of&#xD;
their parents.&#xD;
This instance has ere now become apparent&#xD;
L to the reader. For a long time past the lovers&#xD;
hhad snatched moments of an evening to meet&#xD;
in secret; and so prudent and cautious had }een&#xD;
1 their proceedings, that though it was occasional-&#xD;
ly whispered in the village that an attachment&#xD;
- did subsist between them, and that they were&#xD;
, now and then seen together, yet the frequency&#xD;
1 of their interviews had remained unsuspected,&#xD;
especially by Peter Davis himself, Now, how-&#xD;
I ever, the whole truth was known to him : he&#xD;
had not merely encountered them in the silent&#xD;
1 shades of the wood, but had beheld them clasp-&#xD;
ed in each other's arms ; and therefore he was&#xD;
instantaneously enabled to account for the fr--&#xD;
quent rambles which Lucy had been accustom-&#xD;
ed to take alone.&#xD;
Wvhen he conducted her away from the spot&#xD;
where the scene with Frederick Lonsdale haid&#xD;
taken place, he maintained a stern silence for at&#xD;
least teniminutes. During this interval the cx-&#xD;
treinity of the wood farthest from  the village&#xD;
was reached ; and the father and da ughter a&#xD;
ceeded to thread a path-which lay throughlithe&#xD;
fields to the neat little dwelling which, midway&#xD;
between *Oakkeigh and the Manor House,5 o1-&#xD;
cupied a sweetly pituresque position. It stood&#xD;
in the midst of a little garden, where the flow-&#xD;
ers exhibited the tasteful care bestowed upon&#xD;
them by Lucy herself; while the internal ar-&#xD;
rangements of the cottage denoted an equally&#xD;
sedulous female supervision.          aly&#xD;
And so, Lucy," said her father, at length&#xD;
breaking silence, as emerging from the wood&#xD;
they proceeded through the fields. " you have&#xD;
held clandestine meetings with this Frederick&#xD;
Lonsdale, and have given him  evidently the&#xD;
utmost encouragement that a young lady cant&#xD;
possibly give under such circumstances I Doubt&#xD;
less the usual lovers' vows have passed between&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
Father," replied Lucy with a firmness of&#xD;
voice that was inspired by the candor of ie&#xD;
nature and the artless purity of her thoughts,&#xD;
"not-for a moment longer will I seek to disguise&#xD;
from you the truth, that I lo love Frederick&#xD;
Lonsdale--love him with all lmy heart and with&#xD;
all my soul, and can never love another I It&#xD;
is true also that I have pledged my faith to&#xD;
him"&#xD;
" Ah, I feared as much i" observed l)avis;&#xD;
and he bit his lip to keep down a sudden out-&#xD;
burst of rage: but immediately on perceiving&#xD;
that im order to carry out his own designs, he&#xD;
must proceed misidiously and craftily, not violent-&#xD;
ly and passionately, lie said, " Lucy, have I&#xD;
deserved this of you 1 Wherefore such deceitful&#xD;
conduct? wherefore such hypdcrisy I Am    I&#xD;
not your father I and have I not done a father's&#xD;
duty towards you I"&#xD;
"Yes-and heaven knows that I have endea-&#xD;
vored, to prove an obedient daughter," mur-&#xD;
mured the poor girl, the tears now trickling&#xD;
down her cheeks. " But it is impossible te&#xD;
control flue feelings of thie heart. No humao&#xD;
being, dear fathm', has this power In"&#xD;

"But every wise and prudent young woman," and as your father I am proud of you. If you&#xD;
rejoined the bailiff, :"exercises a proper restraint formed a low ConneXion like this, it would drive&#xD;
over her feelings. Lucy, you cannot for a moment me mad : I would cast you off for ever. But I&#xD;

"I do not seek to justify it," she answered,- Instead of looking downward, you should look&#xD;
: merely to extenuate it. That I was wrong to upward. It is the greatest misfortune that can&#xD;
meet Frederick clandestinely, I will not deny: hefall a young woman, to marry beneath her-&#xD;

at your feet and imploring you, as you valued  Lucy scarcely heard what her father said:&#xD;

and it is sufficient to provoke my severest anger haps if her father had burst forth into a furious&#xD;

"Yes-too well, father," replied Lucy, with a&#xD;
deep mournfulness of tone and a despairing&#xD;

up a candle and hurried from the room.&#xD;
That was the first time since her earliest&#xD;
years, that she had ever sought her chamber&#xD;
without bidding her sire good night and kissing'&#xD;
his cheek : but on this occasion, she could not&#xD;
do it no, she could not&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
TlE REDBURtN FAMILY.&#xD;
WE must now, upon the same evening, intro-&#xD;
duce our readers to the drawing-room of Red-&#xD;
burn Manor, so that we may have an opportu-&#xD;
nity of affording some farther insight into the&#xD;
diaracters of the Baronet and his family. It&#xD;
has already been said that Sir Archibald him-&#xD;
self was a man of about fifty years of age: we&#xD;
may add that he was a tall, fine-looking lman,&#xD;
with a florid complexion, a portly form, and an&#xD;
upright gait. He loved to dress in what he&#xD;
called "the good old style of an English gentle-&#xD;
man :namely a blue coat with brass buttons, a&#xD;
bull waistcoat, black small-clothes, and hessian&#xD;
boots reaching to the middle of the calf of the&#xD;
leg, and with a little black tassel in the front of&#xD;
each.&#xD;
Lady Redburn was about ten years his junior,&#xD;
and was an exceedingly handsome woman-&#xD;
now in the full erbonpoiut of forty, and though&#xD;
thus somewhat exuberant in figure, with her&#xD;
charms but little impaired by the hand of time.&#xD;
Her dark hair had not the slightest thread of&#xD;
silver to destroy the uniformity of its raven sur-&#xD;
face. Her eyes still retained much of their&#xD;
youthful fire; and her teeth were excellently&#xD;
preserved. It is true that art now supplied the&#xD;
lace of the natural roses which had once&#xD;
bloomed upon her cheeks: but the rouge was so&#xD;
skilfully laid on by a clever lady's-maid, that&#xD;
amongst country people it passed for a natural&#xD;
bloom, and every body at Oakleigh expressed&#xD;
admiration at the'freauty of her ladyship's com-&#xD;
plexion. Her mind was not however equal to&#xD;
her person: it was narrow, shallow, and frivolous&#xD;
to a degree-at the same time that her pride&#xD;
was inordinate, and she had the most sovereign&#xD;
contempt for "everything vulgar." Lady ited-&#xD;
burn, as well as her husband, considered that&#xD;
the working-classes were born for the mere pur-&#xD;
pose of fulfilling the part of serfs and bondsmen&#xD;
to the higher orders; and therefore any one&#xD;
who dared entertain a different opinion, was at&#xD;
once set down as a wicked, seditious, and evil-&#xD;
disposed person. We need hardly add that Sir&#xD;
Archibald was an inveterate Tory of the old&#xD;
-chool, devotedly attached to the British Consti-&#xD;
tution, firmly believing that society would&#xD;
&#xD;
crumble to pieces if the Established Church fell&#xD;
and that the 'industrious millions ought to-go&#xD;
down upon their knees and bless heaven that&#xD;
they were ruled by an Hereditary Aristocracy.&#xD;
Miss Redburn, the Baronet's sister, was a hy&#xD;
of very nearly the same age as her sister-in-law,&#xD;
Lady Redburn: or to speak with the closest ao-&#xD;
curacy, she was thirty-nine. But very different&#xD;
was she in personal appearance. Of tall stature,&#xD;
her figure was thin, even to emaciation: she ap-&#xD;
peared to be all skin and bone ; and not even&#xD;
the artifices of the toilet could bestow upon her&#xD;
shape the semblance of contours to conceal its&#xD;
leanness. Her face was equally thin, and of a&#xD;
death-like paleness. Her eyes were of a glassy&#xD;
azure-not the serene pure hue of heaven, but&#xD;
the light bluish shaje which has a dead dull&#xD;
look when seen in the human eye. Her lips&#xD;
were thin, and usually held compressed-not for&#xD;
the purpose of hiding -the teeth, because these&#xD;
constituted her only good feature-but through&#xD;
a habit which she had contracted. Her look&#xD;
was altogether disagreeable-almost repulsive:&#xD;
yet it was not an old maidish primness that chil-&#xD;
racterized her, but an universal acerbity of tem-&#xD;
per and bitterness of disposition legible in every&#xD;
feature,-and shining through her as it were with&#xD;
its sinister light. She was habitually reserved&#xD;
and   taciturn; but when she spoke, it was ge-&#xD;
nerally to say sour and unpleasant things. She&#xD;
dressed with some degree of care, and evidently&#xD;
studied to diminiish the impression of her shrivel-&#xD;
led form as much as possible. Yet she detested&#xD;
society-and very seldom crossed the threshold&#xD;
of the mansion, except on Sunday when she&#xD;
regularly visited Oakleigh Church at the two&#xD;
services, no matter what might be the state of&#xD;
the weather. She had no favorite cats, nor&#xD;
French poodle, nor even a parrot~.--nothing that&#xD;
elderly spinsters usually adopt as the objects of&#xD;
their affection for want of that which they have&#xD;
failed to obtain-namely, a husband. She&#xD;
seemed to have no liking for any living thing,&#xD;
and to feast as it were inwardly upon the poison&#xD;
of her own morbid and ill-conditioned mind.&#xD;
And yet those who had known her many&#xD;
years back, represented her to have been a very&#xD;
different being from what those who saw her&#xD;
now might imagine. It was even said that she&#xD;
was once beautiful, and also that she was a gay,&#xD;
laughing, joyous creature with sunny smiles&#xD;
upon her lips, when a girl in her teens. The&#xD;
change which had led her on to be what we have&#xD;
described her alikelin looks and temper, hack been&#xD;
gradual, as if some insidious poison had been im-&#xD;
fused into her and had imperceptibly but surely&#xD;
done its all but fatal work, corroding the whole&#xD;
some essence of physical life, and envenoming&#xD;
all her feelings at the heart's fountain. What&#xD;
was the cause thereof l No one knew. As a&#xD;
matter of course the reader will instantaneously&#xD;
suspect that it was disappointed love: but those&#xD;
who had known her from her infancy, would&#xD;
confidently declare that such was not the case,&#xD;
It appeared, therefore, to be one of those i$f&#xD;
stances of physical blight which are not to be -&#xD;
accounted for, and which involvethe warping of&#xD;
some feelings and the deadening of others i tha&#xD;
premature lecay of the whole being. -&#xD;
